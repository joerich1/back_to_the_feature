OVER BLACK

We hear A distant crowd becoming restless A guitar
being tuned Buying time

The crowd’s cheers morph into “JACKSON JACKSON
JACKSON”

FADE IN
INT DOME TENT - BACKSTAGE - DUSK
SILHOUETTE OF A MAN IN A HAT head down Spits Then --

EMERGING FROM THE DARKNESS JACKSON (JACK) MAINE (early
40s) pulls out a PRESCRIPTION PILL BOTTLE dumps a FEW
PILLS into his hand -- knocks them back -- drinks deeply
from a GIN ON THE ROCKS the alcohol spilling down his
beard the awaiting crowd just off in the bg A MALE
ROADIE slaps him on the back

JACK
All right let’s do it

He walks onto --

INT DOME TENT - MAIN STAGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The crowd erupting With a wave he flings off his hat
and wields his guitar his RHYTHM GUITARIST now opposite
him

And at once in tandem they unleash dueling guitars with
the sheer force of rock ‘n’ roll -- an explosion of sound
as the speakers scream his latest hit “BLACK EYES” --

JACK
(singing)
‘Black eyes open wide
It’s time to testify
There’s no room for lies
And everyones waitin’ for you
And Im gone
Sittin’ by the phone
And Im all alone
By the wayside’

The stage lights blaze from above as the song reaches its
fever pitch He may be a little drunk but this is
Jackson Maine in his element a singer-songwriter with a
mean guitar He doesn’t just play it’s an all-out
attack And as the song ends we go --
INT SUV - TIGHT - JACKS PROFILE - LATER

Camera flashes zip by across his face stadium lighting
fading away in the reflection as he knocks back a BOTTLE
OF GIN --

INT BILTMORE HOTEL - BATHROOM - WIDE SHOT - DAY

PAN ALONG the bottom of a number of stalls The bathroom
seemingly empty Until we hear a HUSHED VOICE and see
two feet in heels in a stall down at the end

ALLY (0S)
(into phone)
Roger Youre a wonderful man
yes and youre a great lawyer
Were just not meant to be
together

ANOTHER ANGLE - INSIDE THE STALL
ALLY CAMPANA (early 30s) is on her cell phone

ALLY
(into phone)
No I don’t wanna marry you -- are

matter with you Roger were
done Oh God

She hangs up opens the door to the stall and screams
bloody murder

ALLY
Fucking men

She pulls herself together

INT BILTMORE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

She walks PAST various CATERING SERVERS AND STAFF with
her best friend RAMON -- he’s an aspiring dancer with a
sinewy body like a swimmer flamboyant wonderful

RAMON

CUT TO

EXT BILTMORE - TRASH AREA - NIGHT

Ally tosses a bag of trash into the dumpster She hums
to herself just audible over the LOUD TRASH COMPACTOR

ALLY
(singing)

‘When all the world is a hopeless
jumble

And the raindrops tumble all
around

Heaven opens a magic lane

When all the clouds darken up the
skyway

Theres a rainbow highway to be
found’

And as Ally ascends the tunnel into the night
SUPERIMPOSE TITLE

INT THE BLEU BLEU - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON an eyelash being put on Hair slicked back
through a THREE-FOLD MIRROR cascading light from hot
bulbs in a small crowded dressing room as MEN IN DRAG
(EMERALD SOOKI DONTE) and a few others dress talk and
prance about

DRAG BAR EMCEE

pieces of SOMEONE

DRAG BAR EMCEE

BACKSTAGE

We see a SILHOUETTE go down a short hallway FOLLOWING
her all the way UP the side of the stage and INTO the
wings waiting to go on and now lit from the curtains
It’s ALLY
BACK AT THE BAR

JACK
Is she really singing though or
is it one of those karaoke things

RAMON
No no no Shes really singing
papo I promise you shes really
singing

JACK
Okay

RAMON
Watch this Watch

BACK AT STAGE

Ally takes a breath and goes over to the microphone
and simply begins to sing Edith Piaf’s most famous song
La Vie En Rose” in French In her voice an echo of the
brokenhearted woman’s life is a revelation

ALLY
(singing in French)
‘Des yeux qui font baisser les
miens
Un rire qui se perd sur sa bouche
Voila le portrait sans retouches
De lhomme auquel jappartiens

And although her performance is demure in nature she is
remarkable her voice so exceptional talent so
transcendent Jack can’t help but just stop and listen --

Ally sings as she wanders through the audience She
crawls onto the bar effortlessly lays back among the
half-made cocktails and spirits

ALLY
Would anybody like some French
tips tonight

She gets up onto the bar and begins walking toward
Ramon her performance all done to a measured
perfection minus one tiny moment where her eyes pivot and
clock Jack standing there -- only to regroup and continue
with the song

She lies back seductively caressing herself with a rose
and giving it to Ramon --

She locks eyes with Jack completely engrossed by her
Then --

Ally makes her way back to the stage as the song comes to
a close She sings the last impressive note The
LIGHTS GO OUT as the crowd hoots and hollers

RAMON
Yes baby Yes baby

JACK
Oh fuck

RAMON
Papo are you crying

JACK
Ah no

RAMON

Yo you have to meet her

DRAG BAR EMCEE
Oh Lord Somebody kill me now

He begins to pluck the strings something utterly
different from that assault of “Black Eyes” --

JACK
(singing)
‘Maybe its time to let the old
ways die
Maybe its time to let the old
ways die
It takes a lot to change a man
Hell it takes a lot to try
Maybe its time to let the old
ways die

Ally emerges into the room to find Jack under house
lights in the flesh and blood feet away in a private
concert for three

JACK
(singing)

Nobody knows what waits for the
dead

Nobody knows what waits for the
dead

Some folks just believe in the
things theyve heard and things
they read

Nobody knows what waits for the
dead

Im glad I cant go back to where
I came from

Im glad those days are gone gone
for good

But if I could take spirits from
my past and bring them here

Then he notices her And sadly for everyone else the
song comes to an abrupt end --

JACK
You ready
She nods
EMERALD
Hmm you know I would
OFF Ally --

EXT COP BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

Jack and Ally walking into a CROWDED DOWNTOWN BAR As

he’s got his regular drink gin on the rocks with a
twist

JACK
Can I ask you a personal question

ALLY
Sure

JACK
Do you write songs or anything

ALLY

The bartender drops off another drink of Jack

JACK
(to bartender )
Thank you
(to Ally)
Why

ALLY
I just I just dont feel
comfortable

JACK
Why wouldnt you feel comfortable

ALLY
Um Well ‘cause like almost
every single person that Ive come
in contact with in the music
industry has told me that my nose
is too big and that I wont make
it

JACK
Your nose is too big

ALLY
Yeah

JACK
Your nose is beautiful

Jack looks at her dumbfounded She turns her head
profile takes her finger and runs it down from her
forehead over her nose down to her chin
JACK
Are you showing me your nose right
now

She embarrassingly smiles

ALLY
Yeah

JACK
You dont have to show it to me
Ive been looking at it all night

ALLY
Oh come on
JACK ALLY
Oh Im gonna be thinking No youre not Youre
about your nose for a very full of shit
long time
JACK
Im not full of shit
ALLY
Yeah you are
JACK
Im telling you the truth
ALLY
Yeah youre full of shit
JACK
Can I touch your nose
ALLY
Oh my gosh
JACK

Let me just touch it for a second

She laughs but he’s serious He reaches in she lets
him His finger brushes the top of her nose intimate
surreal

JACK
Youre very lucky

ALLY

Oh really

(he nods)
Yeah not really My nose has not
made me lucky

(beat)
I couldve had maybe a hit song
if it wasnt for my nose

JACK
Thats fucking bullshit

ALLY
Yeah No its not bullshit
because you go into these rooms
and there’s all these fucking men
in there and they’re just staring
at you listening to your record
going ‘Oh you sound great but
you know you don’t look so
great’

JACK
You know I had a thing when I was
little I was born with this
thing in my ear Couldn’t hear
What do I wind up being A
singer So you never know
(then)
Look Talent comes everywhere
everybody’s talented I bet you
fucking everybody in this bar is
talented in one thing or another
but having something to say and a
way to say it so people listen to
it that’s a whole other bag And
unless you get out there and
you try to do it you’ll never
know That’s just the truth If
there’s one reason we’re supposed
to be here it’s to say something
so people wanna hear it

She’s looking at him

JACK
Dont you understand what Im
trying to tell you

ALLY
Yeah I do I dont like it
But I understand it

They share a smile
JACK
Oh I think you like it a little
bit I think Im getting through
a little bit I can see it

ALLY
No you cant

JACK
Its a good thing we met

ALLY
Yeah

JACK
For both of us trust me

ALLY
I mean I dont know what is going

(MORE)

JACK (CONTD)

He stumbles back into Jack too close

TOMMY
(to Jack again)
Excuse me one sec --— My ex-

Ally puts her hand over her face looking to Jack like
“Im so sorry”

TOMMY

Ally pulls his hand away and in doing so he gets rough
with her

TOMMY

ALLY

Ally punches him in the face sending him back into the
crowded bar Everyone in the vicinity takes note

I find myself longing for change’

She starts to get up

ALLY
I started writing this song the
other day and

She gets up off the curb and into the parking lot her
very own stage

ALLY
Maybe that could work like as a
chorus or something I have to
think if I can remember it

(singing)

‘I’m off the deep end
Watch as I dive in
I’1ll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface
Where they can’t hurt us
We’re far from the shallow now’

JACK
Holy shit

She starts to laugh noticing her pea-wrapped hand
ALLY
(laughing)
What is this Was this supposed
to help me

She sits back down next to him He leans into her

JACK
Can I tell you a secret

Closer now and whispering --

JACK
I think you might be a songwriter

She downcasts her eyes away from him

They walk around a wall of amps and through PEOPLE onto
SIDE STAGE LEFT where we FIND Jack drenched with sweat
playing along with his band in the middle of the stage in
front of thousands She squeezes Ramon’s arm She
cant help but be taken by the overwhelming power of the
whole thing

JACK
(into mic singing)
‘I told my dyin daddy that I had
to run away
Looked him in the eye and said
There aint no other way
So woman if I tell you that I
love you be okay
‘Cause I aint lyin’
(MORE)

JACK (CONTD)
I dont lie
Without an alibi
‘Cause I aint lyin
I dont lie
Without an alibi’

And Jack instinctively turns and sees Ally ending the
guitar solo into the chorus refrain that he belts out
with two other players

Ally watches his every move time seems to slow down for
her out of body wanting to experience each and every
moment it’s all second nature to Jack And as the
song ends

JACK

(into mic)
Thank you very much That was
great Theres a friend of mine
who came a long way to be here
She wrote a great song and Id
just like her to sing it I think
its pretty fucking good

The audience cheers He motions her on the stage and
now she is hit with severe self-consciousness she
doesnt want that she starts to walk off Jack

bounds over to her taking her hand

JACK
How are you You made it

ALLY
Im good Hi

JACK ALLY
Its so good to see you How are you That was so
good

JACK
So listen were gonna sing that

ALLY
(stammering)

JACK

He tries to drag her by the hand onto the stage She is
frozen shaking her head

ALLY
Jack please Its not funny
Jack dont fuck around

RAMON
Oh my God

Ramon backs away from their struggle She wont succumb
she adamantly shakes “no”

Jack comes closer into her --

JACK
All you gotta do is trust me

She frees her hand starting to walk off into the
shadows to hide

JACK
(returning to the
stage)
Thats all you gotta do Im
gonna sing it either way so

ALLY
(sotto voce)
‘Trust me’ Okay
RAMON

You have to go sing

ALLY
Im not going out there no

Jack starts to play a familiar melody reminding us of the
song she came up with the night before He starts to
sing the first verse --

JACK
(into mic singing)
‘Tell me somethin’ girl
Are you happy in this modern
world
Or do you need more
Is there somethin’ else youre
searchin’ for’

In fact that is exactly what it is “SHALLOW”

JACK
(into mic singing)
‘Tm fallin’
In all the good times
I find myself longin’ for change
(MORE)

JACK (CONTD)
And in the bad times I fear
myself’

And he stops and looks at her imploring her verse She
turns and looks at him

Jack just standing there on stage willing to sit in the
silence Just looking at her Waiting One moment
feels like forever until Ally summons the courage steps
on stage and starts to sing from the wings --

ALLY
(into mic singing)
‘Tell me something boy
Arent you tired tryin’ to fill
that void
Or do you need more
Aint it hard keepin’ it so
hardcore
Im falling
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And in the bad times I fear
myself
(chorus )
Im off the deep end
Watch as I dive in
Ill never meet the ground
Crash through the surface
Where they cant hurt us
Were far from the shallow now’

And as she finishes singing the chorus to him his band
joins in

ALLY AND JACK
(into mic singing)
‘In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
Were far from the shallow now’

He motions her to take the downstage microphone She’s
come this far -- She walks further onto the stage and
belts out the chorus

ALLY

(into mic singing)
‘Im off the deep end
Watch as I dive in
I never meet the ground
Crash through the surface
Where they cant hurt us
Were far from the shallow now’

And the crowd goes wild

ALLY AND JACK
(into mic singing)
‘In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
Were far from the shallow now’

And as they sing together thousands of iPHONES raise
recording the moment Jack singing with her as if he
was a boy and nothing will ever be the same again

And as the song comes to a close she can’t believe it
Jack senses her shock and goes to her

ALLY JACK
Oh my God Theres so Pretty fucking good
many people Pretty fucking good

We see from --

ALLY’S POV

all of it new to her surreal and frightening and at
once euphoric

INTEXT OUTDOOR AMPHITHEATER (BAY AREA) - NIGHT

Ally is following Jack as he weaves THROUGH the tunnels
of the amphitheater TO an opening a loading dock where
she first arrived

ALLY
I think the way the guitar just
started and

JACK
I thought maybe I set it in the
wrong key and then the tempo was
too fast

ALLY
No it was so beautiful and

JACK
I wasnt sure

Then without warning they are mobbed by a mass of

people vying for Jack “Jackson Jackson” PEOPLE
take selfies with him as he walks by a blur of faces

ALLY

She looks around for Jack for respite but she’s lost
him An unexpected moment of panic washing over her
When --

of a young MAN confident beyond his years We’1ll come
to know him as REZ

Jack pulls Ally into his trailer where a big crowd is
partying Jack puts his cowboy hat on her head where she
receives an encore from Jack’s band

INT HOTEL - HALLWAY - LATER

Jack stumbles down the long corridor of the hotel with
Ally in tow A little loaded he searches for the key
but in which pocket He finds it and they enter the
room

INT HOTEL - ROOM - NIGHT

They barge in he turns and kisses her Ecstatic if not

sloppy and as they catch their breath with the hint of
something more to come

ALLY

She pulls away as Jack stumbles a toxic rush of blood to
the head

ALLY
(sotto voce)
Wheres the fucking bathroom

Jack makes his way to the couch lights a cigarette and
lies down

Ally returns to where Jack was but -- Bobby is putting
Jack into bed

BOBBY
(to Jack)
Cmon pal

And used to it Bobby perfunctorily puts a pillow under
his head Ally watches Bobby handle Jack with a
surprising tenderness -- He looks at her

BOBBY
He’s out
(then laughing at
her willful naiveté)
You think maybe he drinks a bit
much Sweetie you have no idea

He starts to walk off but turns to her --

BOBBY
Tell you one thing though Hes
never brought a girl onstage
before
(beat)
And its been a long long time
since he played like that

ALLY
Well thats good to know

And leaving her all alone Ally sits on the edge of the
bed while Jack sleeps Watching him sleep alone with
her moment of glory

She starts to hum the melody to “Somewhere Over the
Rainbow” ever so lightly as she undresses and climbs
under the covers with him looking small The two of
them quite a pair

INT HOTEL - THEIR ROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

Ally under the covers asleep beside Jack His eyes
open He comes awake finding his bearings He sees her
next to him asleep He looks at her back

He moves closer tenderly kissing her shoulders She
murmurs coming awake He kisses her neck She rolls
over He kisses her face Her lips

She pulls him closer as they make love in the witching
hour what feels like a real love

INT HOTEL - THEIR ROOM - LATER

Jack in his shirt and underwear and Ally in a hotel robe
sitting around the dining table eating breakfast

The song goes into its generational anthem chorus the
crowd begins to jump in unison to the beat a slave to
her command of the song --

Jack saunters off weaving his way farther into the
bowels of the dark --

The sound slightly receding as he makes his way across
into a place less populated

As stoned as he is Jack can still play the guitar
ICONIC GUITAR RIFF TO “PRETTY WOMAN” --
But for a moment he holds the note maybe just a tad too
long The performers freeze Then he pulls it together

and the song begins

And as BRANDI CARLILE TAKES THE VOCALS AND CRUSHES IT --

Ally can see along with everybody else he is
noticeably trying as he might to do his best just an
afterthought

Bobby drives his TRUCK down a dirt road with Jack riding
shotgun They’ve ridden like this across the country and
back a lot over the years A lot of hard miles on the
odometer and between brothers Bobby looks over to him
then back to the road Jack just stares out the window
lost in thought

BOBBY
I think if we had a better band
name we mightve made it Or
maybe it was because we looked
like a father and son duo Not
many of those around

Jack laughs

JACK
I was not a good look for you
thats for sure

BOBBY
Not my fault I couldnt find a
better guitar player in the whole
goddamn state
They share a small laugh Then after a beat

Jack starts to get out of the truck but stops short

JACK
Hey you know uh when I um

And with that Jack shuts the door Bobby takes that
in then drives off Jack watching him go

familiar and somehow foreign like riding in the backseat
of your own car Little things are different the
furniture has been rearranged slightly A “La Vie En

He goes over to it Turns it on realizing this new
addition their home

Then Charlie runs up to Jack a “welcome home” bow tied
around his collar

and walking up to him they embrace A long hug long

EXT JACK’S HOUSE - GARAGE - LATER

Jack is in his truck He sits as it idles presumably
warming it up Then after a beat he backs out of the
driveway but then --

Stops Cuts the engine Sits and waits We can’t see
what he’s doing but he shifts around in his seat for a
moment almost as if pulling something from his pocket

get a glimpse of the ceiling fan slowing its spin

The door closes

INT FORUM - LATER

And as Ally’s BAND plays out the last few bars her voice
holds the final note Long and steady the audience
exhilarated to see how long she can hold it -- which is
very long

A beat A breath
The audience on their feet already wanting an encore

Eruption of a CROWD going crazy as Ally breathless
comes UPSTAGE RIGHT down their staircase into the bowels
below the stage

Rez is waiting --

ALLY

She gulps from a water bottle while the stylists change
her costume Rez in tow

Ally turns and walks back up the stairs and out into the
thrash of people --

The audience applause morphing into a chant

The band plays a familiar intro -- the first few chords
of “Shallow” The audience catches it they erupt in
tandem with the band coming in full force --

This is a whole new version of Jack and Ally’s song
This song has evolved much like the performer at center
stage

Tell me something boy

INT FORUM - STAGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Ally plays and sings by herself at a piano on a platform
in the middle of the arena along with Jack’s guitar on
its stand --

Ally launches into the CHORUS with the same power we
heard echoing through the street their first night

ALLY

(over speakers

singing)
‘In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
Were far from the shallow now
O00 OUO O000 haaaa’

(into mic)
Give it up for my husband
Jackson

And as the SONG ends breathing heavy --

EXT JACK’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

Charlie is at the garage door back and forth trying to
get in barking Something’s wrong

EXT JACK’S HOUSE - LATER

Red and blue lights flash Inside through the glass
doors it seems Jack has left the “La Vie En Rose” neon

light on

DISSOLVE TO

INT JACK’S HOUSE - MUSIC ROOM - MORNING

Ally at the piano alone broken Bathed in the red
light of the “La Vie En Rose” neon sign She plays a few
melancholy chords a song we’ve only begun to hear
EXT JACK’S HOUSE - GRAND WINDOW - DAY

LOOKING IN Ally looking out The garage in the
distance Her roots have grown out showing the natural
brunette the markings of the Ally we met at the
beginning of the movie Her eyes transfixed on the
vista below

INT JACK’S HOUSE - HALLWAYBEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Ramon sits with Ally in the window seat Rubs her back
RAMON
I can stay if you want
INT JACK’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATER

Ally stares at JACK’S TOUR POSTERS Something building
inside her And then she snaps --

CRASH

She begins smashing them glass flying in a rampage

SAME SCENE - LATER

Ally sits cradling Jack’s guitar amongst everything
broken and smashed

INT JACK’S HOUSE - MUSIC ROOM - DAY

Bobby sits next to Ally equally broken feeling the very
same thing quiet He doesn’t move although it feels
like they need to hold each other

BOBBY
Some kid started singing one of
his songs in a bar I was in the
other night Theyre playing his
songs everywhere

He thinks about it

BOBBY

At first I got angry I dont
know why I guess I felt like
how can any of these people feel
like they knew him Who he really
was

(beat)
But then something changed And
it soothed me That well it
wasnt all for fucking nothing

She looks at him

ALLY
(sobbing)
The last thing I did was lie to
him
BOBBY

Listen to me It isnt your
fault It just isnt You know
whose fault it was Jack Thats
it No one else Not you not
me No one but Jack

ALLY
(crying)
I just keep going over and over
it over it in my head

After some moments

BOBBY
Jack talked about how music is
essentially twelve notes between
any octave Twelve notes and the
octave repeats Its the same
story Told over and over
Forever All any artist can offer
the world is how they see those
twelve notes Thats it

Ally looks at him hearing him

INT THE SHRINE - NIGHT
Packed with people seated in this huge theater

BOBBY (VO)
(post-lap)
He loved how you see them He
just kept saying ‘I love how she
sees em Bobby’

A SILHOUETTE OF A WOMAN her head down in the wings Her
hands clasping each other -- Much in the same way she
would hold Jack’s hand And it is Ally

And were --

WALKING now WITH Ally She’s in a DRESS heading into a
proscenium larger than we have ever seen The lights
find her

WE GO --

WIDE ANGLE

The crowd embraces her “We love you Ally” and
encouragement from all over She puts her head down
We see she’s a brunette No makeup

ALLY
(whispering into the
microphone )
Hello Im Ally Maine Thank you
for being here tonight to honor my
husband

The crowd adoring her accepting her at her most
vulnerable

ALLY
(whispering into the
microphone )
He wrote a song for me Id like
to sing it for him tonight And
with your help maybe I can
Thank you Really Thank you

And with that she begins to sing an original song “I’11l
Never Love Again” We SLOWLY PUSH IN -- The audience a
distant sound their encouragement their belief

ALLY
(singing)
‘Wish I could
I could have said goodbye
I would have said what I wanted
to
Maybe even cried for you
If I knew it would be the last
time
I would have broke my heart in
two
Tryin’ to save a part of you
Dont want to feel another touch
Dont want to start another fire

(MORE)

ALLY (CONTD)
Dont want to know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Dont want to give my heart away
To another stranger’

We see GLIMPSES of their times together performing on

stage when

they were just beginning their relationship

ALLY
‘Or let another day begin
Wont even let the sunlight in
No Ill never love again
Ill never love again
Oooouuu oooUu ooU
Oh
When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that Id find
myself lyin’ in your arms
Mmmm mmmm
And I wanna pretend that its not
true
Oh baby that youre gone’

We see GLIMPSES of Ally and Jack in bed with the glow of
the “La Vie En Rose” neon sign She runs her finger down
his profile they laugh together

ALLY
‘Cause my world keeps turnin’ and
turnin’ and turnin’ and Im not
movin’ on
Dont want to feel another touch
Dont want to start another fire
Dont want to know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Dont want to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Wont even let the sunlight in
No Ill never love
I dont wanna know this feeling
unless its you and me
I dont wanna waste a moment
Hoooo ouuu
And I dont wanna give somebody
else the better part of me
I would rather wait for you
Hoooo ouuu
Dont want to feel another touch
Dont want to start another fire
Dont want to know another kiss
Baby unless they are your lips’

HARD CUT TO

FLASHBACK - INT JACKS HOUSE - SUN ROOM - DAY
Jack at the piano Ally watching him play

JACK
(singing)
‘Dont want to give my heart away
to another stranger
Dont let another day begin
Wont let the sunlight in
Oh Ill never love again’

She gets up and walks up from behind placing her arms

around him holding him Their heads touch and let the
final chord slowly ring out

CUT BACK TO

THE SHRINE (PRESENT)

Ally looks up and then straight TOWARDS us the
audience and a star is born
