rappels into view This is ALEX OCONNELL He’s 18 now
with floppy blond hair and an English accent He’s inherited
his father’s good looks and his mother’s academic intellect

LILY
Alex you see anything

He peers up at LILY CHEN who’s staring through a hole in the
roof of the cavern 50 feet above Lily’s about Alexs age
and her mysterious beauty is matched by a rvazor-sharp mind

ALEX
Not yet but I know the palace is
down here It has to be

LILY
That’s what you said about the
other nine caverns

ALEX
This is the one Lily I’m going
deeper

LILY

I don’t think that’s a good idea
ALEX
Trust me I was rappelling into
tombs before I could walk I’ma
pro

As he loosens the clamp the rope slides free and Alex is
sent plunging into the darkness Lily reacts as Alex’s rope
rapidly uncoils at her feet She SHOUTS into the abyss

LILY
ALEX ALEX

Alex scorches his palms as he desperately tries to reattach
his harness to the rope Finally he pounds his fist into
the head of the clamp causing its teeth to lock back into
place As the rope jerks him to a stop he instinctively
snatches his glasses out of the air as they tumble free

LILY
Alex are you okay

ALEX
I’m hanging in there

He pulls out a flare-stick and cracks it open He holds it
out as he slowly twists himself around and comes face to face
with a FEARSOME TERRA COTTA WARRIOR Alex grins

ALEX
Lily radio Willoughby tell him I
found it

INT TOMB OF THE TERRA COTTA WARRIORS - DAY

Time has turned the palace courtyard into a vast subterranean
vault Warriors are lined shoulder to shoulder Lily
supervises a CHINESE CREW who are illuminating the giant
space with torches Alex waits for an OVERWEIGHT ENGLISHMAN
in a white linen suit who is awkwardly clambering off a rope
ladder This is SIR COLIN WILLOUGHBY

WILLOUGHBY
My colleagues at the Bembridge
Society thought I was crazy to put
my faith and money in an OConnell
But I knew you could do it Alex

ALEX
Thank you Sir Colin That means a
great deal coming from you

Willoughby pulls a magnifying glass from his pocket and
rudely brushes past Lily as he crosses to admire a warrior
WILLOUGHBY
Look at the detail I wonder how
long they took to carve

LILY
They weren’t carved they were
cursed

WILLOUGHBY

According to whom

LILY
Chinese legend The terra cotta
warriors have remained poised in
time waiting for their Emperor to
return

WILLOUGHBY
Alex you should tell your
girlfriend not to put so much stock
in old folklore

Alex awkwardly shuffles

ALEX
Actually Lily’s not my girlfriend
She’s a PhD student at Shanghai
University I couldn’t have found
this tomb without her help

Willoughby regards Lily skeptical

WILLOUGHBY
What’s your field of expertise

LILY
Ancient Chinese history and
languages

Unimpressed Willoughby turns back to Alex

WILLOUGHBY
Once you take the Bembridge oath I
trust you’1l leave such fairy-tale
hokum behind

ALEX
But only full scholars take the
oath

WILLOUGHBY
You are our youngest associate now
I predict you’1l be our youngest
scholar They couldn’t deny you
after this discovery

ALEX
Sir Colin I don’t know what to
say That’s been my dream ever
since I desecrated my first tomb

Before Alex can correct himself Willoughby wraps him in a
sweaty bear hug

WILLOUGHBY
You’ ve got a lot of work ahead of
you This place is going to take
decades to excavate

As Willoughby puffs his way down a row of warriors Alex
turns to Lily grinning like a kid at Christmas

ALEX
Alex O’Connell Bembridge Scholar
Wait until my mum hears about this

LILY
You don’t need that pompous ass
Willoughby to validate you It
would take him three lifetimes to
learn what you already know

He smiles looks at her clearly enchanted

ALEX
Lily I was wondering when we get
back to Shanghai if maybe we could
do something together you know
that doesn’t involve digging holes
or climbing down ropes

LILY
Is that your way of asking me out
on a date

He nods shyly Although touched she lets him down gently
LILY

Id love to but I kind of make it
a rule not to date colleagues

ALEX
Of course absolutely good
thinking Wouldn’t want to blur
the lines with all the work we’ve
got ahead of us

OFF Alex masking his disappointment as she heads away
CUT TO

A BRUSH -- flicks the dust from the dragon insignia that
embellishes the chest plate of a terra cotta warrior Alex
stands back confused as Lily steps to his side

LILY
Everything okay

Alex points to three pairs of terra cotta warriors who stand
side by side and bear the Emperor’s insignia

ALEX
You have any idea what six of the
Emperor’s personal bodyguards are
doing in the middle of a formation
of foot soldiers

LILY
Maybe they got lost

ALEX
They would never have left his
side

Alex bends down sweeps away some dirt revealing a track-
like groove He looks back at Lily and grins

ALEX
You want to meet an Emperor

Alex steps between the first pair of warriors puts his hands
on their chests and pushes them over The statues slam into
the ones behind them knocking them over like bowling pins
As the third pair topple they lurch to a stop and

GRINDS OPEN in the floor between the six statues OFF Alex
and Lily’s excitement

INT CRYPT - DAY

Four stone Chimera mythical dragon-like tomb guardians
stand in the corners of the chamber as Alex leads Lily and
Willoughby down the steps The trio stares in awe at the

Emperor’s ornate sarcophagus It’s sitting on a carriage —
harnessed to a chariot drawn by four bronze horses

s h raw

WILLOUGHBY
The final resting place of Emperor
Qin Shihuang You’ve guaranteed
your place in the history books
with this one my boy

Willoughby steps to the sarcophagus It’s carved out of red
jade and is inlaid with the Emperor’s dragon insignia

WILLOUGHBY
I want the sarcophagus taken to the
British Embassy in Shanghai for
safe keeping immediately

Alarmed Lily steps in front of Willoughby

LILY
No the Emperor can’t leave this
chamber

WILLOUGHBY

I don’t remember requesting your
opinion on the matter

LILY
If you move the Emperor you’1l be
making a huge mistake

Willoughby rolls his eyes turns to Alex

WILLOUGHBY
I suggest you have a word with your
lady friend if you want her to
remain on this dig

Alex waits until Willoughby exits

ALEX
Lily we’re archaeologists We
don’t dig something up to leave it
behind We have to take it back
and study it

LILY
The ancient scrolls say that if the
Dragon Emperor awakes he will lay
waste to the entire world

ALEX
In order to raise a mummy you need
the Book of the Dead There’s only
one copy and trust me it’s buried
under the Sahara
14

Alex turns away studies the lid of the sarcophagus
ALEX
This guy’s just terra cotta and
bone He couldn’t hurt a fly

As his hand brushes over the dragon insignia Lily sees the
stone Chimeras’ mouths snap open

LILY
GET DOWN

She dive-tackles Alex and they roll under the chariot just as
ROARING 20-foot jets of flame shoot out of the mouths of the
Chimera When the inferno ends Lily looks at Alex
LILY
I’ve never seen someone cheat death
so many times

ALEX
You should meet my parents

Evy peers through the view-finder of a Baby Brownie camera

CLOSE ON An upside down image of the Taj Mahal

EVELYN
Remember when Alex climbed that
minaret

O’ CONNELL

Yeah I bet him a year’s allowance
he couldn’t do it Then we dodged
the Indian police for two hours

He smiles sadly as they make their way through the THRONG
O’ CONNELL
I miss being the fun dad Alex
couldn’t wait to hang out with

EVELYN
Well somewhere between the tombs
of Egypt and the temples of Persia
your son grew up

0’ CONNELL
I know and I’m really proud of him
But the truth is he’s closer to you
than he is to me

EVELYN
If you want to know what he’s up
to why don’t you read his letters

0’ CONNELL
Honey they’re in ancient Egyptian
with jokes about obscure pharaohs

EVELYN
He did inherit my wry sense of
humor

Rick shakes his head Evy tries to stay positive

EVELYN
Look you need to reconnect with
him in your own way When you were
his age what did you like

Oo” CONNELL
Girls guns girls

EVELYN
Trust me your son has no time for
romantic dalliances He’s a
freshman at Yale I’m sure he‘s
absorbed in his studies

decrepit traffic market stalls and cows

0’ CONNELL
I still can’t believe you talked me
into spying for the British
Government

EVELYN
We’re in the middle of a war Rick
I wanted us to do our part
Besides I’ve talked you into
worse

0’ CONNELL
You don’t even know why you’re
following him

EVELYN
The Home Office said the less we
know the safer we are Were just
supposed to observe his movements
and report back

O’ CONNELL
Lucky your husband likes to live
dangerously

EVELYN
Rick what did you do

Rick grins mischievously

O’ CONNELL
Played a little poker with the
Defense Minister’s brother and let
him win occasionally According to
him Okumura claims to have access
to a doomsday weapon

Evy’s instantly intrigued

EVELYN
And what might that be

O’ CONNELL
Nobody knows but the Japanese High
Command weren’t impressed They
bounced Okumura and his followers
out of Tokyo faster than you can
say sushi

As Okumura pulls up in front of the Taj Mahal he is met by
TWO FIERCE-LOOKING SIKHS wearing blue turbans

EVELYN
What’s a rogue general doing in
India

O’ CONNELL
That’s where the spying part comes
in

INT TAJ MAHAL - DAY

ATTENDANT
Shoe Shoe

They turn and find an INDIAN MAN pointing to a sign “NO

surreptitiously watch as Okumura and his crew head into

INT PEACOCK CHAMBER - DAY

Rick and Evy hustle in then stop in their tracks There’s
no sign of Okumura and there’s no exit

O’ CONNELL
One way in and no way out

The walls are covered with marble reliefs of Indian wildlife
Elephants monkeys tigers and peacocks They push and prod
at the menagerie Evy sighs in frustration

EVELYN
I better take some pictures of
where the trail went cold

Evy snaps photos while Rick tugs at an elephant statue He
yanks down on its trunk breaks it off As he tries to
reattach it Evy lines up a shot and sees something

EVELYN
Pinch my cheeks

Rick quickly slips the broken trunk in his pocket

oO’ CONNELL
Not now Honey we’ve got a bad guy
to catch

EVELYN

Look through the view-finder

She hands him the camera and points to a design inlaid on the
wall above a relief of a peacock Its tail feathers glint
with semi-precious stone As he peers through the camera

WHAT HE SEES Viewed upside down the abstract design now
appears to spell out a phrase

EVELYN
Those symbols are actually
Sanskrit except they’re upside
down and backwards They spell
“Pinch my cheeks”

Evy reaches across pinches the peacock’s cheeks causing its
“feathers” to fan back into the floor revealing a doorway

INT PASSAGEWAY - DAY

Old brass lanterns illuminate the network of Moorish
corridors and hallways Rick and Evy come to a recently
excavated hole in the floor Distant VOICES echo from below
Rick drops a stone into the darkness and hears it SPLAT

0’ CONNELL
Sounds soft After you

Evy takes a breath then drops in feet first Rick follows
INT PIT - DAY

The duo torpedoes into the mud They’ re up to their necks
19

EVELYN
Why is the mud moving

Both look down and see they’ve landed in a pit of writhing
SLUGS They slither out frantically brushing slugs and
slime off their clothes

EVELYN
Disgusting doesn’t even begin to
describe that

Rick plucks a slug out of his ear Evy SQUELCHES up to a
filigree grille and peers out

WHAT SHE SEES A giant 50-foot silver statue of the
elephant god Ganesh in the middle of a huge subterranean
cavern He holds a sword in each of his eight arms Like a
sinking ship the whole place is weirdly tilted at an angle

EVELYN
The Lost Temple of Ganesh The
final repository of

OKUMURA (0S)
the Eye of Pemako

As they spin Rick reaches for his gun but comes out with a
handful of slugs They stare at Okumura who is flanked by
the two sword-wielding Sikhs

OKUMURA

When I heard the British had sent
the infamous O’Connells to spy on
me I was flattered Expertise
like yours is hard to come by

(beat)
Now I’m going use it to get me the
Eye

Rick points to the diamond gleaming on Ganesh’s forehead

Q’ CONNELL
It’s right there get it yourself

OKUMURA
You of all people should know these
ancient temples are full of hidden
dangers

He tosses a flaming torch into the wide well surrounding
Ganesh revealing a pit of slumbering CROCODILES Their
bodies are entwined like a giant jigsaw puzzle OFF Rick and
Evy’s distress

INT TEMPLE OF GANESH - DAY

Tiny oil lamps flicker in thousands of niches dug out of the
walls Rick stifles A YELP as he stubs his bare foot on the
tail of a 20-foot croc

Of CONNELL
No gun no shoes and we’re walking
across a bunch of alligators Who
stays up at night and thinks of
this stuff

EVELYN
Actually honey they’re Indian
crocodiles far more vicious But
lucky for us it looks like they’re
hibernating

O’ CONNELL
Way to find the silver lining Evy

He glances at the sword-wielding Sikhs who are following

O’ CONNELL
So what does Okumura want with the
Eye of Pemako

EVELYN
They say the stone points the way
to the Spring of Eternal Life which
is hidden in Shangri-La

O’ CONNELL
As much as I’d like to take a swig
from the fountain of youth and stay
this ruggedly handsome forever --
that’s a myth

EVELYN
You used to feel the same way about
mummies

They scramble out of the pit and begin to climb the statue
while the Sikhs stand guard at the base

OKUMURA -- watches the duo clamber up the silver behemoth

RICK and EVY -- reach the top of the statue Evy waits behind
one of its 6-foot ears while Rick reaches for the giant
gemstone He almost topples as he wrestles it free hands
the stone to Evy As she examines it her brow furrows
21

EVELYN
Rick this isn’t it

O CONNELL
Looks like a big sparkly diamond to
me

She scrapes the stone against the edge of Ganesh’s ear then
shows Rick its scarred surface

EVELYN
Diamonds don’t scratch

A loud METALLIC CLANKING echoes from the belly of the statue
Like a giant clockwork toy the statue GRINDS to life Its
eight arms swing their razor-sharp swords and its head nods

RICK AND EVY

try to keep their balance but tumble off As they plunge
towards the pit Rick drops the diamond but manages to catch
hold of one of the statue’s eight arms He reaches out and
grabs Evy’s hand as she falls past him As they dangle Rick
sees a sword sweep towards Evy A second before

THE GLEAMING BLADE

slices her in two Evy lets go SCREAMING as she drops Rick
swings up his bare feet as the sword razors under him then
looks down and is relieved to see Evy hanging onto the end of
Ganesh’s trunk

OKUMURA -- races down into the pit BARKS orders to the
Sikhs who begin climbing up onto the statue

As Sikhs stalk towards Evy Rick is helpless until he sees
three of the statue’s arms converge their swords form a
makeshift staircase Rick bounds across the blades and
tackles the Sikhs right off the statue As they tumble Sikh
1 is impaled on one of Ganesh’s swinging swords while Rick
and Sikh 2 crash into the croc pit

OKUMURA -- is unaware of the commotion as he picks up the
glass diamond and sees it’s veined with cracks Furious he
SMASHES it against the base of the statue powdering it

EVY -- peers into the statue’s navel cavity Two eyes stare
back She reaches in and pulls out a life-size SILVER SKULL
When she plucks it out CAMERA SHOOTS INTO THE EMPTY HOLE and
ZIGZAGS between the statue’s cogs and gears as they

GRIND TO A HALT

CAMERA DIVES towards the base of the statue as a kinetic
furnace unleashes a fury of hot steam CAMERA FOLLOWS the
steam into a maze of pipes and emerges through a grate under
Rick who is lying dazed He GROANS as his bare feet are
seared He hops out of the way watches as the statue
shudders to a stop and steam billows from 100 other grates

0’ CONNELL
Evy how did you turn off the arms
and turn on the steam bath

EVELYN
I’m not sure but I found the Eye

Spangles of light ripple across Evy as she hinges open the
skull and stares at THE EYE It’s an egg-sized diamond with
a large pupil-shaped emerald embedded within it

EVELYN
It was inside Ganesh’s belly
Which makes perfect sense you see
in Indian culture the third eye is
about looking inward

A BULLET zips past Rick It’s Okumura

QO’ CONNELL
Fill me in later

Okumura pops off TWO MORE SHOTS Rick races away dives for
cover among the sleeping crocodiles As he peers through the
steam he sees the eyes of a croc pop open Then another and
another They’re all waking up He slowly turns his head
until he’s staring into the open eyes of the croc directly in
front of him It’s got a shit-eating grin on its snout

Just as the ferocious reptile lurches towards him with its
jaws snapping Rick shoulder-rolls to his feet and takes off

O’ CONNELL
Evy I figured out what the steam
does

Evy slides down Ganesh’s right leg clutching the skull box
turns to find the cavern is shrouded in a carpet of steam

EVELYN
Rick where are you

She jumps down unaware of the threat Suddenly a shape
emerges through the curtain of steam behind her It’s Sikh
2 He’s holding a sword and creeping up on her

He’s about to slice her in half when a GIANT CROCODILE leaps
out of the mist vices the guy in his jaws and drops out of
frame with lightning speed Evy hears the man’s MUFFLED CRY
spins but sees nothing When she turns back she is
startled to find Rick right next to her She swats him

EVELYN
Don’t do that

0’ CONNELL
We need to go Now

However as they turn Okumura steps out of the steam with
his gun aimed at Rick

OKUMURA
Give me the Eye

O’ CONNELL
Don’t do it Evy

Suddenly an ENORMOUS RUMBLE BOOMS from inside the statue and
the whole place shakes throwing them off their feet and
sending the skull box flying Okumura scrambles after it
Rick right on his tail Evy follows avoiding the jaws of a
dozen starving crocs

OKUMURA -- sees the silver skull is reaching for it when
Rick dive-tackles him The two men exchange blows As Rick
falls back Okumura clambers for the skull He’s just
grasped it in his hand when A MASSIVE CROCODILE leaps up and
bites his arm off at the elbow Okumura drops to his knees
and SCREAMS in agony Rick scrambles right past him and
after the croc as another RUMBLE echoes from Ganesh

Of CONNELL
Come here boy

As the crocodile opens its mouth to SNARL Rick sees the
skull box is still clutched in the palm of Okumura’s severed
arm which is lying on the croc’s tongue

O’ CONNELL
Good croc

Rick gets an idea pulls the marble tusk from his jacket As
the croc moves in Rick thrusts the tusk into its mouth
wedging it open He reaches in and grabs the skull box a
second before the reptile’s jaws snap shut OBLITERATING the
marble tusk like a toothpick

Rick runs back to Evy who’s trying to fend off a trio of
crocs They hear GUNFIRE and turn to see Okumura SHOOTING
his way out They’re completely surrounded by HISSING crocs

O’ CONNELL
I thought Ganesh was the god of
good luck

EVELYN
Actually he’s the god of wealth
intelligence

Suddenly there’s A DEAFENING GROAN and the statue topples
off its base As it CRASHES its sword-wielding arms impale
the crocs that are about to devour Rick and Evy

EVELYN
and remover of obstacles

The duo clambers up onto the statue which forms a bridge
over the crocodile pit

INT TAJ MAHAL — DAY

Rick and Evy look like they’ve been dragged to hell and back
Rick holds his shoulder as they cross to the shoe Attendant

EVELYN
I should report to the Home Office
and you should see a doctor

Rick hands the Attendant his ticket The man stares in
shock Rick’s shirt is ripped and his face is streaked with
dirt and blood

0’ CONNELL
The other guy lost an am

As Rick starts pulling on his boots he surreptitiously takes
the Eye out of its skull box and slips it into a compartment
in the heel of his boot As he ties his laces

O’ CONNELL
Now let’s get this vacation
started

Evy meanwhile notices the “Times of India” sitting on the
Attendant’s chair She picks it up and stares at the photo
on the front page in disbelief

EVELYN
Rick did you know someone found
the First Emperor of China

O’ CONNELL
You’ re kidding Who did that son-
of-a-bitch Willoughby finally get
to do the job

EVELYN
Our son

She angrily spins and thrusts the newspaper into his chest

He raises his champagne flute in a toast

JONATHAN

They’ re about to clink when the whole place goes SILENT
Jonathan turns and sees a TRIO OF JAPANESE OFFICERS lead by
MAJOR SUKI striding towards a table of INTENSE CHINESE MEN
The Major stares at the leader of the group CHANG

CHANG
Youre in the wrong bar they don’t

MAJOR SUKI
Show me your papers

JONATHAN
Gentlemen this club has a strict

JONATHAN
I serve all kinds including

He SNAPS his fingers THREE GORGEOUS BARMAIDS step over

JONATHAN
Now please enjoy my hospitality

As they lead the Japanese away Jonathan addresses Chang

JONATHAN
I think it’s time you found

As he turns back to the bar Jonathan is slapped across the
face He stares in surprise at Evy

EVELYN
How long has Alex been in China

JONATHAN
Alex is in China
She slaps him again

0’ CONNELL
You may want to rethink your
answer

EVELYN
My son makes the biggest discovery
of the century and I have to read
about it in a newspaper

JONATHAN
I tried reaching you in India But
I guess you were out gallivanting
on elephants or whatever you do on
a second honeymoon How was it

O’ CONNELL
Crocodiles slugs secret temples
you know the usual

JONATHAN
Maybe you two should go on a
package tour next time

EVELYN
Jonathan

JONATHAN

(finally caving)
Alex sent me a telegram six months
ago He told me he needed extra
money for books and would I be a
good uncle and wire it to him The
next thing I know he’s on my
doorstep said he had an
opportunity of a lifetime

O CONNELL
Which part of “world war” made you
think that was a good idea

EVELYN
We sent Alex to America so he
wouldn’t be in harm’s way

JONATHAN
Don’t blame me he’s your son it’s
not like you two have been role
models for playing it safe

O’ CONNELL
Where is he

INT ALEXS APARTMENT - NIGHT

There’s a KNOCK at the door Alex swings it open revealing
Lily She steps in and is surprised to see a candlelit table
for two and a bottle of champagne in a bucket

LILY
Do you always study with
candlelight and champagne

Alex feigns nonchalance

ALEX

Oh that It was a gift from the
British Consulate apparently my
discovery has been a big morale
boost to everybody back home

(picking up bottle)
Come on one drink between friends
before we hit the books

Lily smiles her agreement With macho confidence Alex tries
to open the bottle but struggles with the cork finally he
puts the bottle between his knees

LILY
Need a hand

ALEX
I’ve done this a thousand times
It’s all in the wrist

At that moment the cork POPS and a geyser of champagne
sprays over him drenching his shirt As he turns away we
see that Lily is clearly charmed by his awkwardness

ALEX
Give me a minute

Alex steps behind a screen takes off his shirt and looks for
a replacement Lily sneaks a peep at his reflection in a
mirror and clearly likes what she sees fThere’s a LOUD KNOCK
at the door Alex calls out

ALEX
I’m busy slip the telegrams under
the door

Another LOUDER KNOCK

LILY
You want me to get it

Alex pops his head around the side of the screen holding a
lamp under his chin which casts spooky shadows

ALEX
It’s probably just a mummy

LILY
Alex that’s not funny

ALEX
(scary voice)
a mummy Mummy

Suddenly the door bursts open and Evy stands on the
threshold He looks at her in wide-eyed shock

ALEX
Mummy

Alex puts down the lamp as Rick joins her Evy stares in
horror while Rick smiles amused by the situation

0’ CONNELL
Hey kiddo get lost on your way
to Yale

Alex looks at Evy who is seething

ALEX
Mum you look upset

EVELYN
I passed upset two time zones ago

ALEX
I can explain

EVELYN
Youre half naked consorting with
a bar-girl It’s pretty self-
explanatory

ALEX
Lily’s not a bar-girl

LILY
We’re colleagues

ALEX
We were about to exchange valuable
research

0’ CONNELL

I bet you were

EVELYN
And that required candles
champagne and taking off your
clothes

Flustered Alex pulls on a shirt

LILY
Alex I’m going You obviously
have some catching up to do Good
night Mr and Mrs OConnell

ALEX
Lily wait

As she heads out Alex turns to his parents exasperated

ALEX
Way to go guys thanks

QO’ CONNELL
Let me get this straight You lie
to us and we’re supposed to feel
bad about ruining your date

ALEX

It wasn’t a --
(catches himself)

I didn’t tell you about the dig
because I knew what you’d say
That you don’t want me running
around a country on the brink of
war

O’ CONNELL
Yeah were terrible parents
holding you back like that

ALEX
You parked me at Yale because you
still think I’m a child

Of CONNELL
We parked you at Yale so youd live
to see your next birthday

ALEX
For your information I tried to
enlist
(off their shock)
But they wouldn’t take me Said I
was 4F Bad eyes Flat feet

EVELYN
I’m afraid you inherited my
family’s genes The Carnahans
aren’t known for producing football
stars Just look at your Uncle
Jon

ALEX
When Sir Willoughby called and said
I could be of service to my
country I jumped
(to Evy excited)
Mum he’s going to make me a full
Bembridge Scholar

O’ CONNELL
That doesn’t matter

But Evy’s face suddenly glows with pride

EVELYN
Full scholar Alex that’s
fantastic Just what weve always
dreamed about

ALEX
Sir Willoughby is throwing me a
party at the British Consulate
tomorrow night

0’ CONNELL
Evy we’re supposed to be mad
United front remember

A MECHANICAL ARM

A CHINESE ENGINEER wearing thick magnifying glasses is fine-
tuning the arms intricately constructed inner workings with
a drill The man takes his foot off the pedal

Okumura takes the meditation balls in his metallic hand As
his fingers close around them the balls SHATTER in his grip

CHINESE ENGINEER
Too strong I need to adjust the
tension

As he’s about to WHIR the drill back to life Okumura reaches
over and violently crushes the tool

OKUMURA
Leave it It’s perfect

You have done a great service for
Japan When the storm comes you
will be protected

He extends his mechanical hand The Engineer peers at it
finally reaches out He braces for a bone-crushing but is
surprised when Okumura gently clenches his hand As the man
hastily exits he passes Major Suki from “Imhotep’s”

rolls his eyes as an ELDERLY BICYCLIST passes them

O’ CONNELL
It would have been faster going by

Evy shoots him a look

EVELYN
Rick this might be a good time to
give Alex his present

Alex regards his dad with surprise

ALEX
You got me a gift

Rick sheepishly nods hands Alex a box

O’ CONNELL
You know in honor of your big
discovery

Alex RATTLES it gleefully looks at Evy

ALEX
I bet it’s that new set of
archaeological trowels I’ve had my
eye on

EVELYN
Don’t look at me your father
insisted on picking it out himself

Alex RIPS open the lid and stares in disappointment

ALEX
Wow A slingshot

O’ CONNELL
It’s the super-deluxe model It’1ll-
knock the head off a pigeon at 100
feet

Alex tries to let Rick down gently

ALEX
Thanks Dad but I kind of hung up
my slingshot when I was twelve

A MAN suddenly dashes in front of the Bentley The Chauffeur
slams on the brakes and jerks the car to a stop Alex slips
the slingshot into his pocket as TWO JAPANESE SOLDIERS tackle
the Man and drag him back to a LINE OF PEOPLE who have their
arms up against a wall and are being held at gunpoint

JONATHAN
The Japanese have been cracking
down on the Chinese resistance

races over tries to calm the situation as other Japanese
Soldiers circle

ALEX
Dad get back in the car

Rick holds his ground until the beaten man looks at him
It’s Chang the resistance fighter from “Imhotep’s”

fighters are loaded into the back of a truck

ELEGANT CHINESE HOSTESSES As Rick Evy and Alex make their
way through Alex sees Jonathan ducking away

ALEX
Uncle Jon where are you going
The mummy’s this way

well-stocked bar

They step to the sarcophagus Evy is captivated

EVELYN
Fascinating

ALEX
Get a good look They’re shipping
it off to England tomorrow

EVELYN
Tomorrow But you haven’t even
opened it yet

O’ CONNELL
Does the phrase “rest in peace”
mean anything to you two

Evy runs her hand over the Sarcophagus stops when she comes
across five Chinese characters

EVELYN
I don’t recognize the characters in
this cartouche

ALEX
They represent the five Chinese
elements

EVELYN
Of course earth fire water
stone metal

ALEX
If you believe the legend the
Emperor could control them

EVELYN
Better hope he doesn’t rise again

O’ CONNELL
Wait Nobody’s rising again
We’ve been there done that Evy
step away from the mummy

Rick and Evy notice Alex is staring at something they follow
his gaze and see Lily She looks radiant in a mandarin-
collared silk dress and an unusual i

pendant graces her neck She crosses to Alex

LILY
What do you think

ALEX
The operative word is “gulp”

Evy steps forward

EVELYN
Lily we wanted to apologize for
last night Alex caught us a
little off-guard

LILY
If it makes you feel any better
you’ re all he ever talks about
Mrs O’Connell

Evy smiles while Rick rolls his eyes

LILY
If I could borrow Alex for a
moment the Dean of the University
would like to meet him

As Alex heads away with Lily

EVELYN
I don’t know there’s something
about her that bothers me

O’ CONNELL
Maybe it’s the fact that your son
is clearly in love with her

EVELYN
He said they’re just colleagues
O’ CONNELL
Yeah on a dig all alone in the
desert Sound familiar

EVELYN
We couldn’t stand each other

0’ CONNELL

instructions not to engage Okumura

EVELYN
I know that Sir but I assure you
that what we discovered will be of
vital interest to the Home Office

As the Ambassador takes a sip of scotch his face stiffens

EVELYN
Sir if I may say you’re looking a
little peaky

A beat later the Ambassador keels over revealing a Chinese
THROWING STAR imbedded in his back

O’ CONNELL
This meeting’s definitely over

When they spin they come face to face with Okumura He’s
flanked by TWO HOSTESSES who have throwing stars poised in
their hands As Rick reaches for his gun Okumura’s metallic
hand flies up and vice-grips his throat

OKUMURA
Where is the Eye

0’ CONNELL
I think you have me confused with a
twenty-foot croc with a serious
case of indigestion

Okumura forces Rick to his knees

wants

Evy turns and finds Willoughby at the doorway holding a gun
on her Rick removes the Eye from the heel of his boot and
tosses it into Okumura’s waiting hands

As the last guest heads outside THREE HOSTESSES lock the
doors They smile flirtatiously at the three Soldiers
guarding the chariot then in a blur of hands expertly hurl
throwing stars at them The Soldiers drop to the marble
dead just as Okumura and Willoughby lead Rick and Evy in

EVELYN

How could you do this You’re a
knight of the crown
WILLOUGHBY
Empires come and go Evelyn you
should know that better than
anybody Britain is the past
Japan’s the future

yen did Okumura pay you

As Willoughby hands her the Book Okumura steps to the
sarcophagus He taps the symbols in the cartouche like an
ancient combination lock The lid splits open with a
DEAFENING CRACK Evy and Rick watch in horror as the lid
slowly slides away and Emperor Qin Shihuang’s terra cotta

is cocooned in CRACKLING tongues of white hot energy

PUSH IN ON OKUMURA AND WILLOUGHBY watching in awe as the
spectacle reaches a crescendo then subsides Okumura and
Willoughby step forward expectantly but the Emperor does not
move He looks glossy and wet like a newly molded statue

OKUMURA
Why hasn’t the Emperor risen

WILLOUGHBY
She must have misread the book

I most certainly did not

Willoughby jabs the wet clay with one of his fat fingers and
shakes his head in contempt

With shocking suddenness the Emperor’s arm reaches up and
grabs Willoughby’s face Willoughby ROARS in agony as the
Emperor Mummy sucks his life force As the Emperor Mummy’s
skin hardens Willoughby turns to terra cotta Finally the
Emperor Mummy releases his grip Willoughby falls back and
SHATTERS on the floor like a porcelain doll

Rick and Evy watch in horror as the Emperor Mummy lurches up
and gulps his first breath of air in 2200 years His
hardened lids pop open and he stares at them with
Willoughby’s watery blue eyes Okumura turns to them

smashes the Book of the Dead over her head obliterating it

their throwing stars Lily somersaults off the chandelier and
dive-tackles Evy out of the way The Hostesses stare in

As the Emperor Mummy sees Lily his eyes flash with strange
recognition Then he presses his palm against one of the
bronze horses causing bolts of energy to cloak the statues

They stomp their hooves and whip their metallic heads When
the light show subsides the Emperor Mummy and Okumura climb
onto the chariot Rick is about to give chase when he hears
a SNAP He sees the chandelier has broken free with Alex
still clinging to it Rick rolls out of the way as it
SMASHES down while Alex falls into the sarcophagus knocking

wheel spikes amputate the legs off a row of statues Then
Jonathan sees the chariot is headed for a row of parked cars
His Bentley is smack in the middle

hooves trampling it to the ground

Before he can protest Rick yanks him into the truck As it
takes off in pursuit we see the words “DRAGON FIREWORKS CO

Rick hands him a fat-ass rocket

Aim for the Emperor We can still
shatter him

Rick RIPS a section of the canvas away giving him a view
over the cab He ignites the end of a firework and aims it
at the chariot like a shoulder-held rocket launcher

Alex is coming around He pokes his head out of the
sarcophagus and sees a firework streaking towards him He
ducks back down as the projectile HISSES over him and snakes
past the Emperor Mummy and Okumura The Emperor Mummy whips
the horses to go faster as TWO MORE rockets follow

Jonathan grabs the biggest firework It’s a four-foot
monster He lights the fuse and heaves it onto his shoulder

past a house that’s under construction Rick gets an idea

against a wall He shouts back to Evy

long sloping roof He uses it like a half-pipe launches
himself up over the street just as

THE CHARIOT

passes Alex and Lily disentangle themselves stare up from
the sarcophagus as Rick sails through the air

LILY
Was that your dad

ALEX
Yeah he’s got a hero complex
It’s kind of embarrassing

Rick SMASH-LANDS onto one of the front horses lets go of the
bike which is MANGLED under the CLATTERING hooves He pulls
his gun as he swings up onto the beast’s back and FIRES at
the Emperor Mummy BLASTING off one of his ears

OKUMURA OPENS FIRE Rick ducks as BULLETS ricochet off the
metal steeds But then one hits the harness strap and severs
it in two No longer constrained the horse gallops free

ornamental moon door that’s way too small

She’s miraculously unharmed

LILY
Any idea how to get out of here

ALEX
These things usually don’t have
‘directions on the inside

As the chariot makes a wild turn Alex is knocked onto his
side and his lighter illuminates a saucer-size gold disc
inlaid into the lid of the sarcophagus It’s engraved with
five suns and five moons and is ringed by an inscription

ALEX
Maybe the lock’s under here

He attempts to pry the disc out with is fingers but can’t

Mummy swerves into Rick’s path The chariot’s foot-long
wheel-spikes SPARK-SLICE through the horse’s metal legs As
the horse buckles over onto the ice and shatters apart Rick
is violently catapulted free

Daggers of light cut through the Man and heal the Emperor
Mummy’s wounds As the Emperor Mummy drops the Man’s corpse
which smashes onto the floor Okumura is revealed

EMPEROR MUMMY
Why did you raise me from my
slumber The curse still weighs
on me

OKUMURA
Your condition is temporary

The Emperor Mummy looks at Okumura with piercing contempt
Without warning the Emperor Mummy grabs Okumura’s mechanical
arm As he thrusts it to Okumura’s throat the metal
appendage morphs into a razor-sharp scimitar blade

EMPEROR MUMMY
The last general I trusted betrayed
me How do I know you won’t do the
same

The blade presses into Okumura’s flesh

OKUMURA
Because I have found the answer you
spent a lifetime seeking -- the key
to eternal life

The Emperor Mummy lets Okumura go taken by surprise
Okumura hands him the Eye The Emperor Mummy gazes into the
massive gemstone awestruck

OKUMURA
Once the curse has been lifted and
you are immortal there will be no
battie you can’t win no country
you can’t conquer

Conquest requires an army

OKUMURA
Have no fear your warriors will be
ready

OKUMURA
To rule the world by your side

The Emperor Mummy studies the globe intrigued

Jonathan and Lily in a booth It’s after closing Rick
juggles the skull box while Alex and Lily examine the disc

LILY
It’s a Chinese talisman

EVELYN
Can you translate it

ALEX
It’s a warning to the Emperor
Once awakened he has five days to
attain immortality or else he’1l
turn to dust

0’ CONNELL
So even though your mother read
from the Book of the Dead he’s not

immortal
ALEX
Not yet He’s merely undead
JONATHAN
Where exactly does one go to attain
immortality

Evy puts the pieces together

EVELYN
The Spring of Eternal Life That’s
why Okumura needs the Eye of
Pemako to find Shangri-La

JONATHAN
Is this Eye some sort of map

EVELYN
More like a beacon If the Eye is
placed in the Temple of Whispering
Skulls it will point the way
through the Valleyof a Thousand
Waterfalls Behind one of them is
Shangri-La

LILY
But that’s only a legend

JONATHAN
This family’s never met a legend
that wasn’t true
(beat)
Where exactly is this Temple

ALEX
Hidden somewhere in the Himalayas

Alex sees Rick playing with the skull box gets an idea

ALEX
Was the Eye in this

O’ CONNELL
Yeah but I already checked it
over Didn’t find any map

ALEX
In Tibetan tradition skulls are
sacred keepsakes they store
memories

Alex grabs a votive candle from the table

ALEX
- all we need to do is illuminate
them

He flips open the skull’s lid and places the candle inside
Like an ancient jack-o’-lantern the eyes project a crude map
onto the wall

EVELYN
That’s my boy

She hugs him but he pulls away embarrassed by the display

ALEX
Can you please not be that Mum
right now

They cross to the map projection It looks like a Chinese
silk painting and features a stylized impression of a vast
mountain range The Temple of Whispering Skulls is in the
middle and overlooks a long narrow valley of waterfalls
Alex points to the river that snakes through mountains

ALEX
Looks like the Tsangpo River It
cuts right through the Himalayas
and leads straight to the Temple

O’ CONNELL
Explains why our friends were
travelling by junk

Lily studies a block of text at the bottom of the map

LILY
(translating)
“Climb the Ladder to Heaven or
cross the Devil’s Gorge either
path will lead to enlightenment”

Evy points to a staircase

EVELYN
The Ladder must be these stairs in
the cliff face

Rick’s finger charts the tortuous overland route

O’ CONNELL
If we can cross the Gorge we could
still beat them to the Temple

JONATHAN
Or we could all die a horrible
frozen death

ALEX
Way to stay positive Uncle Jon

LILY
Not to join the chorus but that
region is completely inaccessible

0’ CONNELL
Who built the temple

Tibetan monks

Rick grins a plan clearly forming in his head

OQ’ CONNELL

put on a train

As they absorb this Alex sniffs the air

ALEX
What’s the stench
0’ CONNELL
Smells like tequila
LILY
More like yak wine

Yak wine That’s wrong in so many

ways

Rick passes a scorched chest and hears a WHEEZING noise He
puts up his hand and they all stop He pulls his gun swings
open the chest causing a TIBETAN MONK to tumble out along
with two dozen empty goat-bladder flasks This is TEQUILA

0’ CONNELL
Looks like they missed one

Rick leans to check his pulse Suddenly Tequila lets out a
God-awful BELCH Rick backs away disgusted

maroon-colored monk’s attire Lily translates for Rick and

When the Japanese came he was
meditating in a cave His lama had
banished him there to sober up

JONATHAN
Gives new meaning to “cold turkey”

Ask him if he can lead us over the

Lily translates

Crazy round eyes Never It’s
suicide

He’s thinking about it
Rick pulls out some money fans it in front of Tequila
JONATHAN
For God’s sake Rick he’s a holy
man He can’t be bribed
Tequila greedily snatches the cash says something to Lily
LILY
He says he’d be honored to show us
the way
As Tequila heads away Rick turns to Jonathan
O’ CONNELL
Better pick up another mule and a
six pack of yak juice for the road

A ROARING WHITE-WATER RIVER -- the party gingerly leads its
mules across a flimsy bamboo-and-vine footbridge

A SHEPHERD BOY -- stares with amused wonder as the gang
trudges past headed towards the cloud-capped mountains

THE CARAVAN is silhouetted against the sky as they
traverse the treacherous snow-covered spine of a mountain

MOUNTAINSIDE -- sharp snowflakes cut the party’s progress as
they wade through banks of pure-white powder They’re now
wearing heavy fur-lined coats and boots

RICK AND EVY -- emerge through the clouds onto an undulating
plateau of snow and stare in awe at the surrounding peaks

TEQUILA -- leads the party single file along a narrow snow-
covered path It snakes around the near-vertical face of a
gorge Suddenly the path disintegrates from under him

attempts to take a drink but finds the flask is empty As
he angrily tosses the flask into the fire

Jonathan you take the first watch

JONATHAN
Don’t worry Tequila’s got it

think I should carry The

O’ CONNELL
It’s funny you look like my son
but he speaks twelve dead
languages spends most of the time
in the library and hates guns

ALEX
Yeah well I realized that girls
aren’t interested in that kind of
guy

O’ CONNELL
By girls you mean Lily

Alex slumps onto his sleeping bag

ALEX

I’ve been in love with her since
the first time we met I think she
likes me too but there’s
something holding her back I
finally figured out what it is

(beat)
She wants me to be more like you

O’ CONNELL
Alex when I was your age I was a
macho jerk who wandered around the
world looking for a good time

ALEX
Yeah but you were heroic and
always saved the day and women were
throwing themselves at you right

Rick shrugs modestly

O’ CONNELL
Well yeah sure

ALEX
We share the same genes Dad so my
heroic side’s got to be in there
somewhere How do I find it

Rick looks at Alex it’s everything he’s ever wanted to hear
from his son but he weighs his response carefully

OQ’ CONNELL
You really want my advice

ALEX
I’m in your hands

Be yourself Alex If Lily doesn’t
recognize what a great guy you are
then she’s not the one

EVELYN
Alex was telling me that Tibetan is
one of the most difficult languages
to master Yours is excellent

LILY
I’ve been studying it at
university

EVELYN
Is that so because when I called
they had no record of you being
registered in any department

Only now does Lily look up

LILY
Why are you checking up on me Mrs
0’ Connell

EVELYN
Because nothing about you seems to
add up You lied about being a
student and you took an interest in
Alex just when he started searching
for the Emperor

Lily holds Evy’s gaze

LILY
My intentions are as noble as
yours

EVELYN

What about Alex You know he’s
madly in love with you I’d hate
to think you’re using him

LILY
I care deeply about your son Mrs

EVELYN
Alex may be well-travelled but
he’s naive when it comes to affairs
of the heart If you hurt him
you’re going to have to answer to

It would be a lot easier if we had
one less passenger

Jonathan turns away chastised He looks over the side and
peers through a patch of torn clouds and sees that the valley
3000 feet below is covered with evil-looking stalagmites

JONATHAN
Why don’t I give you boys a hand

As he makes his way to the front of the gondola there’s a
horrible snap All look up as the rope BREAKS and the

teeters for a moment then dips forward and surfs down the

Like an oversized toboggan the gondola tears down the narrow

30-foot chasm It doesn’t stop as it SMASH-LANDS back to
earth It plows on RIPS a path through the lines anchoring
1000 tattered prayer flags before

to a stop in a massive snowbank There’s an EERIE SILENCE
before Rick pops out of the snow and finds himself staring
into the eyes of a skull It’s one of a million that are
embedded in the walls of the TEMPLE OF WHISPERING SKULLS

O’ CONNELL
I think we found our temple

It looks like a square-tiered wedding cake and is crowned
with a golden stupa The structure is perched on the edge of
a ridge overlooking the Valley of a Thousand Waterfalls The

There’s a neat trick

The Emperor SNAPS his fingers causing the gravel wall to
split apart and rocket towards the Temple They dive for
cover as the fury of granite projectiles EXPLODES through the

they scramble up Alex looks around and realizes Lily’s gone

and Okumura sweep in Rick and the others drop their guns
and put up their hands in surrender

OKUMURA
I’m afraid this is where your
adventure ends Mr 0’Connell

As he raises his weapon a paint-peeling HOWL reverberates
They look up and see a 10-FOOT YETI on the roof of the
courtyard silhouetted against the sun

JONATHAN
What on God’s earth is that

TEQUILA
(terrified)
Yeti

Four more Yeti join the CHORUS and leap onto the surrounding
turrets Despite their size they move with fast ape-like
agility They’re covered head to toe in thick white fur and
have piercing emerald-green eyes As their lethal saber
tooth jaws suggest they’re far from cuddly The Yeti spring
down into the courtyard causing the building to shake as
they land and go on the attack

A Yeti grabs two Japanese Soldiers and effortlessly flings
them into a wall knocking them out

Jonathan and Tequila take cover behind a giant gong as mayhem
ensues

A Yeti somersaults in front of Rick and Alex yanks them into
the air and is about to slingshot them when Lily issues it a
SHARP GUTTURAL ORDER It obeys unceremoniously drops them
to the floor and springs away Rick looks at Alex

0’ CONNELL
She speaks Yeti

Alex is just as shocked

ALEX
Apparently

Lily sees the Emperor Mummy heading for the stairs She
unsheathes her dragon dagger and hurls it CAMERA FOLLOWS as
it spins through the chaos and nails the Emperor Mummy in the
shoulder He ROARS in pain and light explodes out of his
wound He wrenches the blade free stares at Lily in
surprise then whips the weapon back at her She dives away
and the dagger is impaled in a column Concerned Okumura
races to the Emperor’s side and places the Eye in his palm

OKUMURA
You must put the eye in the stupa

With his eyes still fixed on Lily the Emperor Mummy heads
for the stairs

ALEX
Come on Dad We can’t let him get
to the roof

Rick follows Alex He’s almost caught up when Okumura steps
out from behind a statue and SMASH-PUNCHES him in the gut
Rick flies back into a wall of skulls winded Then he darts
out of the way as Okumura comes at him again Okumura’s
metallic fist PULVERIZES a skull

Rick swings a punch but Okumura catches it and CRUSHES
Rick’s hand Suddenly a long brass candlestick WHIPS across
Okumura’s back He angrily spins and finds Evy He
violently HAND-RAMS her in the chest sending her SLAMMING
into an altar knocking her out

0’ CONNELL
Evy

Enraged Rick barrels into Okumura and the fight is on

The Emperor Mummy is marching across the balcony when a Yeti
leaps in front of him Fearless the Emperor Mummy grabs the
Yeti by the throat and instantly freezes the beast

The Yeti tumbles back through the wooden railing and SMASHES
into a couple of Japanese Soldiers who are stalking Lily in
the courtyard below As the Emperor Mummy continues his
climb Alex is revealed following

Rick and Okumura slug it out against the frame of a massive
bronze prayer wheel Okumura’s fist SPLINTERS the wooden
supports freeing the wheel which powers across the courtyard
like an ANCIENT STEAMROLLER As they continue to battle

LILY

trades martial-arts moves with a Japanese Soldier In an
awesome display she spinkicks the guy into a Yeti who
picks him up and javelin-throws him into the giant gong

As it BOOMS Jonathan and Tequila emerge shaking Jonathan
sees the prayer wheel THUNDERING towards them He tackles
Tequila out of the way As the wheel BULLDOZERS through the
wall they’ re buried in a mound of skulls

Okumura pummels Rick with a series of brain-numbing punches
Finally Rick slumps to his knees spent Okumura smiles

OKUMURA
Once the Emperor is immortal all
Americans will bow at my feet

As Okumura jacks his arm back to deliver the death blow a
Yeti grabs it Okumura SCREAMS as the creature catapults him
straight over the temple wall

EXT LADDER TO HEAVEN - DAY

Okumura flies over the cliff and plummets towards the clouds
As he falls he reaches out and grabs onto one of the stone
steps with his metallic hand

Rick scrambles over to Evy who is coming around

EVELYN

As Rick heads up the stairs Jonathan and Tequila pull
themselves out of the pile of skulls When they turn they
come face to face with a Yeti As they SCREAM the Yeti
SCREAMS back and they’re blasted by spit and noxious breath
Terrified the duo hurtles out through the hole in the wall

EXT STUPA - TEMPLE OF WHISPERING SKULLS - DAY

The Emperor Mummy is climbing the steps that run up the
golden domed stupa Alex is lining up a shot has him dead
in his sights when Rick bursts out from below The Emperor

impales him like a spear Rick looks over as Alex collapses

Rick sees the Emperor Mummy has made it to the top of the

with a bandana and torches their fuses He stands

He hurls THE IMPROMPTU BOMB It SPIN-SPARKS through the air
and right over the Emperor Mummy’s head He looks at Rick
mockingly as it EXPLODES in midair and its BOOM ricochets
across the mountains The Emperor Mummy turns back He’s
about to slot the Eye into place when a DEEP REVERBERATING
CRACK echoes and a massive shelf of snow begins

roaring face appears out of the snow

The Emperor Mummy slows the avalanche’s progress but the
exertion is taking its toll He grimaces in pain

Mummy’s face reacts in confusion then crumbles Now the
wall of snow speeds unfettered towards the temple

the Emperor Mummy is swept away in the freezing tsunami

The Yeti SNARLS and drops them They pick themselves up and
race to Evy and Lily who climb out the front door Evy sees
Rick cradling Alex horrified she runs over He’s deathly
pale and a circle of blood stains the snow

OQ’ CONNELL

Alex looks up weakly

ALEX
I’m sorry I didn’t stop him

His eyes roll back as he loses consciousness

O’ CONNELL

Evy cradles Alex’s head in her hands

EVELYN

Lily CLUCKS to the Yeti carrying Alex It CLUCKS back

LILY
He’s weak but holding on He was
brave to do what he did He must
get that from you

Ricks smiles sadly Lily gently strokes Alex’s face

LILY
If I had destroyed the Emperor
Alex would be okay

EVELYN
Is that what you’ve been trying to
do

She nods

LILY
I’m sorry I couldn’t be honest with
you or Alex But I was sworn to
protect Shangri-La at all costs

EVELYN
Why are you breaking that promise
now

Lily looks at Alex then at Evy finally confesses

LILY
Because I love your son

The Yeti holding Alex stops in front of a raging waterfall
and gently places Alex in Rick’s arms

Before he can finish Lily kisses him overjoyed by his
recovery As he blushes in delight TWO ROBED MEN appear

First you must disarm no weapons
or worldly possessions are allowed

Lily gestures to the golden cauldrons that are piled against
the walls Some contain weapons while others overflow with
gold diamonds and priceless jewels

ZOHORA
My child

They warmly embrace Lily hands her the dragon dagger

ZOHORA
Has the Emperor been destroyed

LILY
There were a few complications

Zohora reacts as the O’Connells Jonathan and Tequila enter

JONATHAN
You’ve got quite a place here
(as Evy elbows him)
But I’m sure you already knew that

LILY
Without their bravery the Emperor
would have discovered Shangri-La

ZOHORA
I understand but I let you out
into the world to prevent the
Emperor’s return You were not to
involve mortals

0’ CONNELL
Believe it or not some of us
mortals have experience in the
mummy department

ZOHORA
I am well aware of your family’s
exploits Mr O’Connell Which is
why I sent Lily when I learned your
son was searching for the Emperor’s
tomb

Guilty Lily looks at Alex

LILY
Alex I wanted to tell you but--

ALEX
It’s easier to say you don’t date
colleagues than admit you’re an
immortal from Shangri-La I
understand

Lily smiles relieved Rick looks at Zohora

0’ CONNELL
The Emperor may be down but he’s
not out He still has twelve hours
to find this place

ZOHORA
I’ve already dispatched a party of
Yeti to retrieve the Eye Without
it he cannot find the Spring and
break the curse

O’ CONNELL
With all due respect to your furry
friends they’re no match for a
mummy

ZOHORA
No one knows the Emperor better
than I do Mr O’Connell I’m the
one who cursed him
(off their surprise)

I found the Book of the Dead As a
reward the Emperor stabbed me and
murdered the only man I ever loved

FLASHBACK TO

EXT HIMALAYAS - NIGHT

Zohora rides through the blinding snowstorm
ZOHORA (VO)

I escaped into the night and rode
for days

Weak she finally topples off her horse and lands in a
powdery drift still clutching the terra cotta Book of the
Dead A shadow falls across her face She looks up and sees
the outline of a Yeti silhouetted against the moon

ZOHORA (V0O)
The Yeti found me as I lay dying

INT GROTTO - DAWN
ZOHORA (V0)
They sensed I was with child and
brought me to the Spring

The Yeti gently lays Zohora next to the GURGLING Spring

ZOHORA (V0O)
I knew I wouldn’t survive the
night so I used the Book to
enchant the Spring Whoever drank
from it would become immortal

Zohora WHISPERS an incantation from the Book causing the
Spring to bubble with light As Zohora drinks the CAMERA
FOLLOWS a trail of water as it flows out and cascades into

EXT VALLEY - DAWN

The bleak ice landscape undergoes a magical transformation
Trees and vegetation sprout maturing in seconds melting the
snow which forms the sparkling lake

ZOHORA (VO)
And so Shangri-La was born It’s a
Yeti word that means “valley of
dreams” I saw it as a utopia from
a world that grew crueller by the
day Here we would be safe from
the Emperor and tyrants like him

The frozen waterfalls that ring the valley begin to gush

ZOHORA (V0O)
Over the centuries the Yeti
brought lost and dying travellers
to the Spring

We see a motley collection of people step through the
waterfall from every race and era CRUSADER KNIGHTS
RENAISSANCE TRADERS VICTORIAN EXPLORERS

All chose to stay and make this
their home

gratitude that I’d freed him from
the Emperor’s tyranny but secretly
he wished to bring his master back

to the Book of the Dead which sits on her desk

when a Yeti leaps in front of him As Fu tries to spin back
another Yeti nails him in the heart with the dragon dagger

ZOHORA (VO)
The Yeti tracked him down but the
Book was lost to antiquity

Fu SCREAMS as his body rapidly ages As his wizened corpse
falls from the saddle the backpack with the Book tumbles
over the cliff and drops into the river below

Zohora nods her understanding

ZOHORA
If you insist on facing the

It’s the dagger he stabbed me with
I enchanted the blade It’s the
only weapon that can kill an

heart

predicament As they step towards him holding spears one of
them stops sniffs the air as though sensing danger With
shocking suddenness two giant arms formed of snow reach out
of the ground grab the creature by its legs and

YANK

it straight down into the snow In violent succession the
other Yeti are pulled under until they’ve vanished The arms
morph into the Emperor’s dragon insignia Okumura scrambles
away as the insignia melts and

is revealed lying in the circular pit His torso is crazed
with cracks and half his face has broken off revealing his
maggot-infested skull and brain Still clutching the Eye he
walks up the smooth-walled trench that magically melts before
him It leads straight to the top of the stupa

Okumura watches as the Emperor Mummy places the Eye into the
circular depression that’s hollowed out of the bronze flame
that still graces the top of the stupa As

SUNLIGHT

hits the Eye the flame glows and a circle of emerald light
explodes out across the valley Slowly the band narrows
until it’s a single line of light which pinpoints one of the
waterfalls on the far side of the valley OFF the Emperor
Mummy’s smile of satisfaction

glass bottle containing an aqua-blue liquid

ZOHORA
Once you drink this you can never
return to Shangri-La

Okumura As he races towards them “snow arms” burst up and
wrap around his legs As he is dragged down Rick grabs the

and slices through the arm that’s pulling him under in a
spray of hot steam and white light As another “snow arm”
twists up Rick cuts it in two and dives for Evy He grabs
her arm a second before she is yanked under

It’s a desperate tug-o’-war but finally he pulls her torso

free and hacks the arm that’s holding her As the amputated
“limb” thrashes like a beheaded snake Rick and Evy take off
after the Emperor Mummy

His skin smokes like it’s been seared by a cigarette lighter

EMPEROR MUMMY
There is only one emperor

In agony Okumura falls to his knees and bows

OKUMURA
I serve only you

The Emperor Mummy removes his finger steps into the Spring
of Eternal Life and hungrily gulps the water As the water
courses over his body it sparkles with energy A new brain
forms in his broken head a new eyeball sprouts and skin
grafts across his cracked torso He ROARS in triumph

Rick steps back into
INT CABIN - CARGO PLANE - NIGHT
Evy and Alex are waiting

ALEX
Zohora said we had to unlock the
River of Spirits It’s the only
way to stop the warriors

O’ CONNELL
Chinese history is your forte
kiddo Any idea what she was
talking about

ALEX
The Emperor threw the bodies of his
enemies in a river that stretched
thousands of miles across China
Legend has it that he slaughtered
so many people the river ran dry

Evy’s mind whirs as she puts it together

EVELYN
The water may be gone but the
spirits of the dead still flow
through it Where is this river

ALEX
There

Alex points out the window as the plane banks revealing the
Great Wall in the distance

ALEX
The Emperor built the Great Wall
over it

EVELYN

So the Wall’s really a giant tomb

Alex nods

ALEX
The Emperor must have feared that
the vanquished spirits would come
back and seek revenge He built
the Wall to keep them in

O’ CONNELL
Great all we’ve got to do is
unlock this ghost river before the
mummy and his terra-cotta army take
over the world

EVELYN
Thankfully nobody’s spent more time
in tombs than the three of us Or
at least anyone with a pulse

An EXPLOSION booms up from the ground They all rush into
INT COCKPIT - NIGHT
Rick grabs binoculars and looks out the window

WHAT HE SEES A fireball consuming a railroad bridge that
traverses a wide desert chasm As the bridge collapses

The Pilot uses the distraction to surreptitiously reach under
his seat and unsheathe a razor-sharp dagger

0’ CONNELL
Looks like a railroad bridge
Guess they don’t want anyone
gatecrashing the palace

The plane tilts

EVELYN
We’re veering off course

JONATHAN
(to Pilot)
Hey no funny business

When he nudges him with the gun the Pilot slumps back
revealing the dagger protruding from his chest

JONATHAN
Bloody hell he’s stabbed himself

ALEX
He committed hara-kiri It’s a
Japanese ritual

(MORE)

ALEX (CONTD)
They believe it’s more honorable to
kill yourself than face the
humiliation of capture

JONATHAN
That’s crazy The honorable thing
to do is to land the plane first
then kill yourself

Rick pushes the dead Pilot out of the chair As he takes the
controls the steering column comes off in his hands

O’ CONNELL
Okay this isn’t good

They hear a WHISTLE turn and find Evy holding a parachute

O’ CONNELL
Do we have enough

EVELYN

Rick looks at Jonathan suspicious
O’ CONNELL
(re cauldrons)
Jonathan no gold

JONATHAN
Perish the thought

He waits as Rick Evy and Alex jump from the plane
JONATHAN

We’re just going to take a few
souvenirs for the road

He drags Tequila over to a cauldron and stuffs gold coins and
handfuls of jewels into his pockets Finally he grabs the
scepter in one hand and a gold Buddha statue in the other
Tequila shoots him an angry look

JONATHAN
What This one’s for you

Before he can get his hands on anything else the plane
lurches sending the duo tumbling out the door

EXT SKY — NIGHT

They spin into the darkness Jonathan tries to pull the
cord but can’t reach it because his hands are full

JONATHAN
Pull the cord

TEQUILA
I have no idea what you’re saying

He looks down to see the other three parachutes open

TEQUILA
Where is our flowering plume of
cloud

JONATHAN

PULL THE BLOODY CORD

He begins making hand gestures which further confuse Tequila
Then over Jonathan’s shoulder Tequila sees the pilotless
plane swing around and head straight for them

TEQUILA
The metal bird It’s going to kill
us Do something
He starts wildly pointing

JONATHAN
DON’T POINT PULL

As the plane careens towards them Tequila SCREAMS

JONATHAN
For God’s sake hold these

He thrusts the treasure into Tequila’s hands and pulls the
cord As the parachute sprouts open they are violently
jerked up missing the propeller by a hair

Tequila drops the treasure as he SCREAMS They finally
stabilize and watch the plane EXPLODE into the desert below

JONATHAN
Well that was a close shave

Tequila shakes his head
