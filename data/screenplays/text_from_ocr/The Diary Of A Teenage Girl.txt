(TITLE CARD The Diary of
aTeenage Girl)

EXT SAN FRANCISCO - YERBA BUENA PARK - AFTERNOON 2

MINNIE GOETZE an intensely smart fifteen-year-old curious
and strong but not jaded walks through the seedy sprawling
park

Minnie’s voice-over recorded onto a cassette tape

MINNIE (VO)
I had sex today HOLY SHIIIITTTTT

Music kicks in - something with a beat Minnie walks
seriously down the path until the chorus chimes in then she
shimmies or swishes her hips in time to the music

Minnie’s POV A boy with blond feathered hair takes a long
slow puff off of a joint Smoke wafts up around his face
dancing with his curls almost magically

Minnie bounds through the park past old strung-out hippies
lounging in the grass One of the women doesn’t have a shirt
on This is the 70s in San Francisco - it’s just how it is

A young woman jogs by in a skimpy seventies jogging outfit
Her unharnessed breasts bounce happily along Comic stars
appear on her nipples and bounce away Minnie looks down and
takes a quick peek at her own less ample breasts
Pink 2

She struts to the music She leaves animated footsteps in her
path

Minnie does a little skip and the music swells and cuts out

She sips a gin and tonic On the TV news coverage of the

trial of Patty Hearst

was described as pallid dull in
complexion and lacking in energy
One court reporter described her
demeanor as “zombie-like”

with shag carpeting wall-to-wall hanging ferns and colorful
afghans The picture of Patty Hearst with a gun is on the TV

CHARLOTTE

BEGIN IMAGINING SEQUENCE

A comic-book style animation a woman’s naked body lying on
her side breaths and move in sketchy pencil lines She moves
in ecstacy

MINNIE (VO)
I was a very ugly child

Her knees part slowly opening seductively exposing a hairy
crotch the pencil lines of the pubic hair going in every
Her toes curl and suddenly through the center of
her legs pops out the head of a baby who looks just like
Minnie- bright-eyed and smiling The animation freezes

END IMAGINING

INT MINNIE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Minnie stands with her tape recorder and microphone The
“birth drawing” is tacked to the wall in front of her

MINNIE
My appearance has not improved so I
suppose it was a lucky break when
he was attracted by my
youthfulness

A cat starts purring around Minnie’s ankle she picks him up
roughly kissing him

MINNIE (CONTD)
Domino you stupid cat I love you
(then whispering)
Hey Domino Do I look different
than I did yesterday

Domino squirms and jumps out of her arms Minnie flops on the
bed a huge grin coming over her face

The walls of Minnie’s room are lined with comic-style
drawings and photographs a tongue or a face homeless
people and transvestites And many self-portraits Minnie
speaks into her mic

MINNIE (CONTD)
(getting serious)
Okay in all matter of factuality
it happened like this

FLASHBACK TO

INT MINNIE’S HOUSE - THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 11

Charlotte is sprawled out on the couch a lit joint dangling
precariously in her fingers falling asleep Gretel eats a
bowl of ice-cream on the floor MONROE 34 a guy with the
attitude and libido of a 15 year old sits on the end of the
couch and stares blankly at The Carol Burnett Show on the TV
drinking a Schlitz beer

Minnie enters in a blue little-girl nightgown plopping down
on the couch moving her mom’s legs over Charlotte groans
and ashes from her joint fall into Gretel’s bowl of ice-
cream

GRETEL
Mom God You’re so gross I can’t
even watch TV without

Gretel gets up in a huff and exits Charlotte doesn’t stir
The TV blares

MINNIE (VO)
My mother was married for a long
time to my step-dad Pascal He is a
science-y guy a PhD

CU on a picture of Charlotte and PASCAL 45 when they were
younger and married Even then they were an odd match

MINNIE (VO)
He has a lot of ideas about how the
world works- doesn’t think women
should drink or smoke

Minnie looks at the joint in her mom’s hand
Yellow 7

MINNIE (VO)
Maybe that’s why she isn’t married
to him anymore She’s “looser” now

Minnie looks toward Monroe

MINNIE (VO)
Monroe Rutherford’s her boyfriend
but they aren’t possessive

Monroe stares at the TV He is handsome in this light with a
boyish face He feels Minnie looking at him and smiles a
little Minnie turns back to the TV There is a long pause
Charlotte suddenly startles

CHARLOTTE
(half-asleep and a little
high)

MINNIE CHARLOTTE
It was the TV Whatdyasay

It was just the TV mom

CHARLOTTE

Minnie debates moving over to the other side of the couch
but just as she makes a move Monroe puts his big hand on her
head Minnie hits Monroe lightly He puts his arm around her
and they curl up together watching TV

MONROE
What are you wearing This
nightgown is totally ridiculous

Minnie blushes

Pink 8

Monroe’s arm dangles around Minnie’s shoulder dangerously

close to her breast Maybe his hand brushes it They sit in
silence watching the TV Minnie moves to the other side of

the couch staring at Monroe

MINNIE (VO)

I know it seems weird but I had
this strangely calming feeling that
even if he touched my tit on
purpose its probably all right
because hes one of our best
friends and hes a good guy and he
knows how it goes and I dont

Minnie looks at Monroe for a sign Monroe cracks another
beer

MINNIE (VO)
But I wonder if my breast felt
small

Minnie touches Monroe’s crotch on the drawing As she stares
deep into Monroe’s face turns to camera so handsome and
charming His eyes twitch with mischief He looks down a
little then back up

breasts

Yellow 9

MONROE (CONTD)

head like a seventies album cover A bird flies out of his
ear and lands on top of his head and starts singing and -

At a tall bar table in a dark corner a bartender drops off

another round to Minnie and Monroe They’re both pleasantly

drunk watch the bartender leave Monroe leans his body into
Minnie’s almost knocking her off her stool

She laughs pushing him but then almost falls off her stool
He catches her

MONROE
(teasing)
Whoa Clumsy clumsy

He helps her back onto her stool holding onto her for a
little too long Minnie gets a case of the giggles he
follows suit

They play a game of “sugarpack football” flicking a sugar
pack across the table trying to make it land on the edge of
the table Monroe flicks the sugar packet through Minnie’s
“field-goal” (her hands) and it disappears off the table

MINNIE
Shit Where’d it go

Monroe gets up and starts rooting around on the ground near
her feet looking for it He bites her ankle She screams too
loud He laughs

MONROE
Shut up You lightweight

He bites her calf grabbing onto her knee Minnie takes his
hand and bites it hard He stands letting her bite him

MINNIE
That doesn’t hurt

MONROE
You can’t hurt me Go ahead

MINNIE
I’m gonna bite you so fucking hard

She bites it even harder as hard as she can

MONROE
I don’t even feel it

MINNIE
You’re drunk

MONROE
I’m just really strong

She bites his finger He likes it He thinks about touching
her face She breathes in wanting him to He flicks her
nose He sits back down
Green 12

MINNIE
You’re far away

MONROE
(quietly)
You just gave me a hard-on

MINNIE
I did

She peers over the table to see

MONROE
Yeah I’m hard

Minnie might laugh but instead she moves closer

Glancing around Monroe takes Minnie’s hand and puts it down
his pants Minnie feels it interested like it’s a science
experiment

MINNIE (VO)
It didn’t feel too hard to me It
had soft skin I dont know what I
expected exactly but I guess flesh
can never be really hard like wood
or Formica

Monroe moans quietly Minnie smiles

MINNIE
I want you to fuck me

MINNIE (VO)
I didn’t even know if I was serious
or not but it was funny and I was
drunk

Monroe removes her hand

MONROE
Youre shit-faced I gotta get you
back to your goddmamn mother

But he doesn’t move away if anything he pulls her closer
searching her eyes

MONROE (CONTD)
I can’t believe you want me to fuck
you Do you really want me to fuck
you

Yellow 13

MINNIE
(playfully)
None of your fucking business

It’s like a game of chicken neither will look away Even in
this moment there is nothing threatening about Monroe

MONROE
You really do want me to fuck you
don’t you You really fucking want
me to fucking fuck you

Minnie stares up at Monroe’s face smiling

MINNIE (VO)
I didn’t know whether I wanted him
or anyone else to fuck me but I was
afraid to pass up the chance
because I may never get another

Minnie is in the bathtub staring at the ceiling where
shadows from the street dance She touches her lips and
mouth which are raw and red from Monroe’s stubble

MINNIE (VO)
It tasted like heated wine - hot
and sticky and the inside of his
mouth was all smooth I tried
giving him a blow-job in the car
and he put his hand in me and
touched my tits He said he wanted
to fuck me but he said we can’t
tonight

MINNIE
(every emotion)
Oh my god Oh my god Oh my god

Minnie dips her head back in the water letting her hair wash
all around her

Green 14

MINNIE (VO)
Sometimes the feeling of water
rushing through my hair makes me
feel so beautiful Like a mermaid
waiting to be rescued from the
depths of the sea

Minnie enjoys this feeling and then suddenly opens her eyes
with a start

MINNIE (VO)
Is this what it feels like for
someone to love you He could have
anyone and he wants me He sees me
I feel different today I never
want to go back

the bed They both have their shirts and jackets on still
and are naked just from the waist down Minnie traces an X on
Monroe’s leg in blood He shakes his head in disbelief

MINNIE

MONROE
I didn’t know you were a virgin

He shakes it off Minnie closes her eyes peaceful

camera

He snaps the picture against his better judgement Minnie
points the camera toward Monroe but he grabs it out of her
hand

MONROE
Nah nah nah Are you crazy

Minnie gives in shaking her picture in her hand

in line with a number in their hand

it on a piece of lacy purple rice
paper that I found crumpled in the
trash I think it’s beautiful

Minnie reads from the crumpled paper Stars start to emanate
from Minnie’s bed floating out into the universe

MINNIE (CONTD)
(into microphone)

“Tt would have been better

To have slept and dreamed

Than to watch the night pass

And the slow moon sink”

The ceiling of her room melts away the stars twinkle above
her She touches her body nonchalantly

MINNIE (CONTD)
I wonder if Monroe is masturbating
thinking about me tonight Monroe
says I exude sexuality Sometimes I
look in the mirror and I can’t
believe what I see I just realized
- I’ve had breasts for a full three
years

She clicks the light off The stars twinkle for one more

INT RICH PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY 32

Minnie sits at a desk by the window The hippie ENGLISH
TEACHER sits on his desk - “cool teacher” style with a copy
of Catcher in the Rye in his lap

COOL ENGLISH TEACHER
I agree Liza Mr Antolini doesn’t
act like an authority figure He
isn’t condescending But what did
you make of the moment where he
touched Holden’s forehead while he
slept

The teacher drones on Minnie doodles listlessly A note
lands on her desk It reads Write me a note Minnie looks
around Behind her a very handsome boy with great hair a
junior named RICKY WASSERMAN 17 winks

Minnie drops the note back on Ricky’s desk He unfurls it
reading A basic pancake recipe includes water flour baking
powder sugar and eggs

COOL ENGLISH TEACHER (CONT’D)
Holden’s attitude toward
homosexuals is called into
question

The note drops back on Minnie’s desk Madame my heart
contains nothing but admiration for you

The bell rings Minnie gathers her things Ricky and his
friend ARNIE another junior blond and tall and preppy
surround her desk

ARNIE
Don’t listen to this bullshit
artist You should probably write
notes to me

RICKY
He’s just jealous because he can
tell you like me

MINNIE
Oh really

RICKY
Youre fascinating you know that

ARNIE
She’s kinda looks like Angelica
Houston don’t you think

RICKY
I see that Angelica Houston is
incredibly beautiful

Ricky flashes a winning smile Minnie is flattered and mute

Moments later a long-haired slacker boy named CHUCK 16
with a skateboard under his arm approaches

CHUCK
What did they want

MINNIE
Who

CHUCK
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dipshit

They watch Ricky and Arnie leave

MINNIE
They’re nice

CHUCK
They’re preppy and rich

MINNIE
Oh don’t be jealous Chuck Just
because Ricky Wasserman thinks I’m
fascinating

Minnie and Chuck start to walk toward the door together

CHUCK
He didn’t say that

Minnie laughs

MINNIE
I know It’s so embarrassing

CHUCK
Tell him to fuck off next time

MINNIE
No one that popular has ever talked
to me before It was kinda
exhilarating

As Minnie and Chuck pass the teacher’s desk he calls out

COOL ENGLISH TEACHER
Ms Goetze - next time I expect
some more participation from you I
know you did the reading

Minnie nods reluctantly on her way out

though nothing has happened

CHARLOTTE

was found guilty Even if she knew
what she was doing in that bank -
she was still a prisoner

Minnie turns on the TV looking to Monroe to see if he’s
going to acknowledge her He doesn’t She stares at him

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)

wannabe artist with a fuck-the-
world attitude And he rode a
Triumph Blackbird Have I ever told
you about that Fuck that was
fantastic

that beautiful machine over to my
house and rescue me And Id hold
onto his waist and scream
God that boy

Charlotte lets out a languished sigh gets up and starts
clearing the dishes She shakes away the memory

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
You know you aren’t always going
to have that body Min I know it’s
not exactly feminist to say but I

yourself out there a bit - a
little make-up a skirt every once

approach He’s not french but he wishes he were

PASCAL
Bonjour

MINNIE
Bonjour Pascal

GRETEL
Hi

Pascal puts out his hand for a shake Minnie and Pascal have
an awkward greeting a sort-of hand shake with a hug tacked
on

PASCAL
No Don’t you remember how I taught
you to shake hands You do it
firmly Look directly into the
other man’s eyes thinking to
yourself ‘I’m better than you you
son-of-a-bitch’

Minnie lets this sink in She says with her eyes I’m better
than you you son-of-a-bitch

GRETEL
Lemme’ try

She takes Pascal’s hand opening her eyes wide almost crazy

PASCAL
Bravo

He pats Gretel on the back The three sit Pascal has three
coffees ready He sips his

PASCAL (CONTD)
I don’t see you two enough That
much is evident by your handshakes

GRETEL
I’m supposed to be at my friend’s
house by 3 Just so you know
Pascal

PASCAL
Gretel call me dad Please
GRETEL
Jeez Okay

PASCAL
I’m glad you finally reached out
It lined up nicely with a trip to
my publishers

Pascal looks around the coffee shop

PASCAL (CONTD)

only friend whose name you can
remember

PASCAL
What No I just know her parents
They’re good people-

MINNIE
She’s visiting colleges She’s in
Boston then I think she’s going to
New York next week

PASCAL
That’s good You should be thinking
about the same things You’ve got a
good head on your shoulders Minnie
I imagine you may be a writer one
day A penniless but certainly
absorbing occupation And how is
your mother

MINNIE
Um she’s doing really well-

GRETEL
She got fired

MINNIE
GRETEL
GRETEL
What
PASCAL
She WHAT
MINNIE
She got laid off It wasn’t her
fault
PASCAL

Girls what you may not understand
about your mother is she is and
has always been incapable of taking
responsibility for her own life

MINNIE
Don’t talk about our mom like that
please

GRETEL

Yeah Pascal Don’t talk about our
mom please

PASCAL
Dad And- okay can we stop the
inquisition

GRETEL

I’m gonna see if they have iced
tea I hate coffee

PASCAL
You know I’m not the bad the guy
here Just because your mother and
I no longer share a marital bed-

MINNIE
Oh my god gross

Pascal leans in to talk seriously to Minnie

PASCAL
You have to understand - it’s
difficult to go from raising you
and your sister to barely having a
say in your decisions
MINNIE
Whose choice was that

PASCAL
Well if you must know it was your
mother’s

This is news to Minnie There’s a long pause

PASCAL (CONTD)
Not to say I was without fault
Your mother became increasingly
frightening to me in some sense
She did not live life according to
rules I understood

MINNIE
Pascal - do you really want to
help

PASCAL

I do I really do

MINNIE
Because mom doesn’t have a job
anymore and she’s looking for
another one but we kinda don’t
have any money

Pascal lets out a big sigh

PASCAL
Ah

MINNIE
She doesn’t know I’m asking you

PASCAL
I get it You’re trying to help
But neither of us can help her
Minnie Not really

MINNIE
Well five hundred dollars -

PASCAL
I mean really help

MINNIE
That’s bullshit You could help if
you cared about us
Yellow 61

PASCAL
Hey I care about you Minnie I
care about your well-being That is
why I’m paying for that rich hippie
school of yours

MINNIE
No you just want to be able to
tell everyone that your step-kid is
good at science or something You
don’t care about me

She starts to tear up

PASCAL
This conversation is closed You’re
getting emotional

MINNIE
Fine

They sit in silence for a moment Gretel returns to the
table unaware

PASCAL
If your mom wants something from
me she needs to ask me herself

Minnie starts getting drawn toward Monroe out of her pink
light almost against her will

Monroe cries in Minnie’s lap muttering “I love you” over and
over again Reality resumes

He was afraid and weak I felt
distant and confused A kind of
perverse pleasure Because Id
finally got what I’d wanted from
Monroe but now I had no desire for
it

96 INT MONROE’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - THE NEXT MORNING 96

Minnie sits on the closed toilet fully clothed filled with
regret What just happened Monroe is in the shower happy
His voice echoes in the bathroom as he lathers

MONROE
You know if you can hold on and
keep it together we could really
date when you turn eighteen That’s
not that far away

Minnie thinks about this and knows she doesn’t want it

Green 80

MONROE (CONTD)

students to start selling for me

like 5000 units a month I’1l be
able to retire in 2-3 years

Minnie jumps up getting out of there

In the living room Minnie looks around for her shoes She
grabs them She finds her book bag and then notices two
dollars and seventy-five cents sitting on the table by the
bed next to Monroe’s wallet She steals that and puts it in
her pocket She leaves as quickly as possible

pill from another She leaves them in the dust as she runs

It’s not a lit-up streetlight hazy
darkness like most nights it is a
black crisp night and my eyes are
light headlights

Francisco becoming part of the sewage and suddenly being
sucked into a drain in the street She spins with the muck
around and around her voice echoing with the sounds of the
city

Tabatha looks to her and gives a little wink She can’t move
from this seat She looks to the door and back to Tabatha
Her eyes fill with tears How did she get here Suddenly
Minnie beelines for the door

TABATHA (CONT’D)
Hey-

She runs like her life depends on it down the many steps
into the street and down the block

EXT MIKE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 121

Minnie runs and runs crying and shaking until she hits a
corner with a phone booth where she lets out a wail Out of
energy out of ideas she slumps down into the booth and
closes the door crouching with nowhere to go

Cars drive by The stars are out Minnie is alone She weeps

MINNIE (VO)
Nobody loves me

She curls up at the bottom of the phone booth

MINNIE (VO)
Maybe nobody will ever love me
Maybe there’re only a few people in
the whole world who are actually
loved - the lucky fucks And the
rest of us walk through the world
like ghosts with no one to see us
or care about us Alone forever

Over-used prostitutes saunter up to cars but get little
action Kids sleep in dark doorways Minnie wimpers She is
out of options

wiping her mouth barely

She drinks from the faucet She swings open the medicine
cabinet and finds one of her mom’s prescription bottles
labeled “Vicodin” She pours them all into her hand
Contemplates She pops one into her mouth puts the rest
back and drops the bottle into her pocket She closes the
cabinet and takes a look at her fucked up face in the mirror
Not liking what she sees she swings the mirror away almost
breaking it

her pillow It’s a letter addressed to her She almost throws
it on the floor but then she opens it

ALINE KOMINSKY’S VOICE
Dear Minnie Thank you for your
letter

Minnie stirs realizing it’s from Aline

ALINE KOMINSKY’S VOICE (CONT’D)
It is refreshing to receive a
letter from a girl because most
letters I get are from greasy fan
boys who think that I’m cute I
tend not to write back to them
Keep drawing those comics Keep
drawing anything you can Just keep
drawing Oh and I use Indian Ink
as well Love Aline Kominsky

Minnie lies back - the weight of everything’s she’s gone
through hitting her She cries This hurts so much Someone
stirs in the living room

jumping on her knocking them both to the ground They hold
each other Just then Charlotte comes in the front door in
her big coat and hat She looks exhausted

Charlotte stares at Minnie Minnie meets her eye unsure of
how her mom will react Charlotte shakes her head - she is at
once relieved and angry

CHARLOTTE

Do you know how worried we were We
looked for you everywhere

MINNIE
You did

CHARLOTTE
Of course I’ve been out all night

to rise

MINNIE
I’m sorry mom I’m so-

CHARLOTTE

Minnie walks down the street Time has passed she looks
healthier It’s a mirror of the opening sequence but she’s
gone through so much She passes people in the park she
looks at them with wisdom in her eyes

MINNIE (VO)
Did you ever go back to your
preschool once you had gotten big
and everything looked miniature
Like the chairs and the monkey bars
- just much smaller than you
remembered

She drops a letter in a mailbox It’s addressed to Aline
Kominsky She sees Chuck walking down the street holding
hands with a girl They make eye-contact for a brief moment
Minnie waves He nods That’s it

Minnie flips through the comic books in the store She finds
a few she likes

species It’s not her fault She
thinks she needs a man to be happy
I don’t

Charlotte whoops and hollers for the band

MINNIE (VO)

Everything that’s happened with
Monroe and Tabatha and Pascal and
my mom has probably fucked me up
somewhere deep in my soul But
maybe it was worth it because I’ve
realized some things It’s not
about who loves you It’s all about
liking yourself Just liking
yourself enough to keep living til
the next day and maybe the one
after that

The guitarist from the band blows a kiss and Charlotte and
she screams lifting her arms in the air

the microphone and dances like crazy loving every moment

EXT BEACH - RUNNING PATH - DAY 131

Minnie sits on a low wall by the running path She has a
blanket laid out with xeroxed zines and drawings for sale
She talks to a tourist

MINNIE
It’s fifty cents but if you buy two
drawings or one drawing and a zine
it’s 90 cents But I don’t actually
have a dime so it would end up
being the same price

The tourist hands her two quarters humoring her and takes a
drawing walking away Minnie enjoys the sun

Monroe jogs by wearing his jogging outfit He sees Minnie
and stops but keeps jogging in place

MONROE

hairy chest It’s beautifully drawn He hates it

MINNIE (CONTD)
(holding out her hand)
