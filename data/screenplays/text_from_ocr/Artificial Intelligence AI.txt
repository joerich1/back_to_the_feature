NARRATOR

Those were the years after the ice caps had melted because
of the greenhouse gases and the oceans had risen to drown
so many cities along all the shorelines of the world
Amsterdam Venice New York Forever lost

Millions of people were displaced climate became chaotic
Hundreds of millions of people starved in poorer countries
Elsewhere a high degree of prosperity survived when most
governments in the developed world introduced legal
sanctions to strictly license pregnancies which was why
robots who were never hungry and who did not consume
resources beyond those of their first manufacture were so
essential an economic link in the chain mail of society

HOBBY

To create an artificial being has been the dream of man
since the birth of science Not merely the beginning of the
modern age when our forebears astonished the world with the
first thinking machines primitive monsters that could play
chess

How far we have come The artificial being is a reality of
perfect simulacrum articulated in limb articulate in

speech and not lacking in human response®

SHEILA
Ahhh

HOBBY
and even pain memory response
How did that make you feel Angry Shocked

SHEILA
I dont understand

HOBBY
What did I do to your feelings

SHEILA
You did it to my hand

HOBBY
Aye Theres the rub Undress
At Cybertronics of New Jersey the artificial being has
reached its highest form Universally adopted mecha the
basis for hundreds of models serving the human race in all
the multiplicity of daily life

Thats far enough But we have no reason to congratulate
ourselves We are rightly proud of it but what does it
amount to

Sheila open

A sensory toy with intelligent behavioral circuits using
neurone sequencing technology as old as I am I believe that
my work on mapping the impulse pathways in a single neurone
can enable us to construct a mecha of a qualitatively
different order I propose that we build a robot who can
love

TEAM MEMBER 1
Love

TEAM MEMBER 2
But we ship thousands of lover models every month

TEAM MEMBER 3
Of course youre your own best customer Siyatsu-sama

TEAM MEMBER 2
Quality control isvery important

HOBBY
Tell me what is love

SHEILA
Love is first widening my eyes a little bit and quickening
my breathing a little and warming my skin and touching with

my —

HOBBY
And so on Exactly so Thank you Sheila

But I wasnt referring to sensuality simulators The word
that I used was love Love like the love of a child for its
parents I propose that we build a robot child who can
love A robot child who will genuinely love the parent or
parents it imprints on with a love that will never end

TEAM MEMBER 3
A child substitute mecha

HOBBY
But a mecha with a mind with neuronal feedback You see
what Im suggesting is that love will be the key by which
they acquire a kind of subconscious never before achieved
An inner world of metaphor of intuition of self motivated
reasoning Of dreams

TEAM MEMBER 4
A robot that dreams

HOBBY
Yes

TEAM MEMBER 4
And how exactly do we pull this off

FEMALE TEAM MEMBER

You know it occurs to me umwith all this animus
existing against mechas today it isnt simply a question of
creating a robot who can love but isnt the real conundrum
- can you get a human to love them back

HOBBY

Ours will be a perfect child caught in a freeze-frame -
always loving never ill never changing With all the
childless couples yearning in vain for a license our little
mecha would not only open an entirely new market it will
fill a great human need

FEMALE TEAM MEMBER

But you havent answered my question If a robot could
genuinely love a person what responsibility does that
person hold toward that mecha in return

Its a moral question isnt it

HOBBY
The oldest one of all But in the beginning didnt God
create Adam to love him

CRYOGENIC HOSPITAL

MONICA

The baby was born as the first leaves of autumn fell A baby
boy And Marions wish came true The boy had white hair He
was baptized Martin after his grandfather

HENRY
Dr Frazier Hi Its good to see you
DRFRAZIER
Hi Howre you

HENRY

Listen there was an article by Randenbach in the Journal of
Chinese Medicine - theyre talking about these virus
locators

DRFRAZIER
Hello again Monica

HENRY
microscopic synthetic hunter killers Did you read that
article

MONICA
I can still hear you

DR FRAZIER
Im worried about her Henry Shes really got me worried

HENRY
Yeah I know

DR FRAZIER

Shes in the most difficult position of feeling she should
mourn the death of your son After five years your instincts
tell you to mourn him too But medicine assures us that
mourning is inappropriate that Martin is merely pending

HENRY
Pending

DR FRAZIER

So all her grief goes undigested Henry your son may be
beyond our science but its your wife who can still be
reached

MASTER BATHROOM

HENRY

The show of faith my company has placed on meon us is
extraordinary Now there are a few simple procedures we need
to follow if and when you decide to keep David If you
decide to keep him theres an imprinting protocol
consisting of a code string of seven particular words which
need to be spoken to David in the predefined order thats
been printed here Now Monica for our own protection this
imprinting is irreversible The robot childs love would be
sealed in a sense hardwired and wed be part of him
forever

Because of this after imprinting no mecha child can be
resold If an adoptive parent should ever decide not to keep
the child they must return it to Cybertronics for
destruction Now I had to sign a letter of agreement or

they wouldnt even let you see David You have to sign it
too right here Monica dont imprint until youre
entirely sure

MONICA
Silly man Of course Im not sure

MARTINS BEDROOM

DAVID

ON THE BOAT

MONICA

As soon as the show was over the showman went into the
kitchen where the whole sheep which he was preparing for
supper was roasting on a slowly turning spit in the furnace
When he saw that there was not enough wood to finish
roasting it he called Harlequin and Pulcinella and said
Bring me in Pinocchio You will find him hanging on a nail
He is made of nice dry wood and Im sure he will make a nice
fire for my roast

MARTINS BEDROOM

MONICA

Pinocchio worked until midnight and instead of making eight
baskets he made sixteen Then he went to bed and fell
asleep As he slept he dreamt he saw the fairy lovely and
smiling who gave hima kiss saying Brave Pinocchio in
return for your good heart I forgive all your past
misdeeds Be good in the future and you will be happy
Then the dream ended and Pinocchio awoke full of
amazement You can imagine how astonished he was when he saw
that he was no longer a puppet but a real boy just like
other boys

HENRY
Thats not how he looked holding the knife

MONICA
Scissors

HENRY
It was a weapon

MONICA
Why do you keep imagining that he was purposely trying to
harm me

HENRY
Uh because we dont know the answer to that How is he
worth the risk to you or to Martin or to us as a family

MONICA
I will not let you take him back You told me what would
happen if you ever took him back

HENRY
Think about this If he was created to love then its
reasonable to assume he knows how to hate And if pushed to
those extremes what is he really capable of

What is Blue Fairy

DRKNOW

Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi At the signal there was a
rustling as flapping of wings and a large falcon flew to
the windowsill What are your orders beautiful fairy he
asked

DAVID
Thats her

DRKNOW

For you must know that the child with blue hair was no
other than the good hearted fairy who had lived in that wood
for more than a thousand years

JOE
David David

DAVID
Thats her

JOE
It was an example of her But I think were getting closer

DAVID

But if a fairy tale is real wouldnt it be a fact A flat
fact

DRKNOW
then the dream ended and Pinocchio awoke full of
amazement

JOE
Say no more New category please Combine Fact with Fairy
Tale Now Ask him again
DAVID
How can the Blue Fairy make a robot into a real live boy

DR KNOW

Come awayO human child

To the waters and the wild

With a fairy hand in hand

For the worlds more full of weeping
then you can understand

Your quest will be perilous
Yet the reward is beyond price
In his book

How Can A Robot Become Human
Professor Allen Hobby writes
of the power which

will transform Mecha into Orga

DAVID
Will you tell me how to find her

DR KNOW

Discovery is quite possible

Our blue fairy does exist

in one place and one place only
At the end of the world

Where the lions weep

Here is the place dreams are born

JOE

Many a mecha has gone to the end of the world never to
come back That is why they call the end of the world
MAN-hattan

DAVID
And that is why we must go there

HALLWAY OUTSIDE DR KNOWS SHOP

JOE

Wait What if the blue fairy isnt real at all David What
if shes magic The supernatural is the hidden web that
unites the universe Only orga believe what cannot be seen
or measured It is that oddness that separates our species
Or what if the Blue Fairy is an electronic parasite that has
arisen to hold the minds of artificial intelligence They
hate us you know The humansTheyll stop at nothing
DAVID

My Mommy doesnt hate me Because Im special andunique
Because there has never been anyone like me before Ever
Mommy loves Martin because he is real and when I am real
Mommys going to read to me and tuck me in my bed and sing
to me and listen to what I say and she will cuddle with
me and tell me every day a hundred times a day that she
loves me

JOE

She loves what you do for her as my customers love what it
is I do for them But she does not love you David she
cannot love you You are neither flesh nor blood You are
not a dog a cat or a canary You were designed and built
specific like the rest of us And you are alone now only
because they tired of you or replaced you with a younger
model or were displeased with something you said or broke
They made us too smart too quick and too many We are
suffering for the mistakes they made because when the end
comes all that will be left is us Thats why they hate us
and that is why you must stay here with me

HOBBY
Yes David Ive been waiting for you

DAVID
Dr Know told me youd be here Is Blue Fairy here too

HOBBY
I first heard of your Blue Fairy from Monica What did you
believe the Blue Fairy could do for you

DAVID
She would make me a real boy

HOBBY

But you are a real boy At least as real as Ive ever made
one which by all reasonable accounts would make me your Blue
Fairy

DAVID

You are not her Dr Know told me she would be here at the
lost city in the sea at the end of the world where the lions
weep

HOBBY

And thats what Dr Know needed to know to get you to come
home to us And its the only time we intervened the only
help that we gave him to give to you so you could find your
way home to us

Until you were born robots didnt dream robots didnt
desire unless we told them what to want David Do you have
any idea what a success story youve become You found a
fairy tale and inspired by love fueled by desire you set
out on a journey to make her real and most remarkable of
all no one taught you how We actually lost you fora
while But when you were found again we didnt make our
presence known because our test was a simple one Where
would your self-motivated reasoning take you To the logical
conclusion The Blue Fairy is part of the great human flaw
to wish for things that dont exist Or to the greatest
single human gift - the ability to chase down our dreams
And that is something no machine has ever done until you

DAVID
I thought I was one of a kind
HOBBY
My son was one of a kind You are the first of a kind
David

DAVID
My brain is falling out

HOBBY

Would you like to come meet your real mothers and fathers

your adventure We want thank you and tell you whats in
store for you next

NARRATOR

And David continued to pray to the Blue Fairy there before
him she who smiled softly forevershe who welcomed
forever Eventually the floodlights dimmed and died but
David could still see her palely by day and he still
addressed her in hope He prayed until all the sea anemones
had shriveled and died He prayed as the ocean froze and the
ice encased the caged amphibicopter and the Blue Fairy too
locking them together where he could still make her out - a
blue ghost in ice - always there always smiling always
awaiting him Eventually he never moved at all but his eyes
always stayed open staring ahead forever all through the
darkness of each night and the next dayand the next
day

Thus 2000 years passed by

BLUE FAIRY
You have been searching for me havent you David

DAVID
Formy whole life

BLUE FAIRY
And what after all this time have you come to ask me

DAVID
I had a wish to make

BLUE FAIRY
And what is your wish

DAVID
Please make me a real boy so my Mommy will love me and let
me stay with her

BLUE FAIRY
David I will do anything that is possible but I cannot
make you a real boy

DAVID
Where am I This looks like my house but it is different

BLUE FAIRY
Yes it is different but its also your home We read your
mind and its all here Theres nothing too small that you
didnt store for us to remember We so want you to be happy
You are so important to us David you are unique in all the
world

DAVID
Will Mommy be coming home soon Is she out shopping with
Martin now

BLUE FAIRY

David she can never come home because two-thousand years
have passed and she is no longer living Dearest David
when you are lonely we can bring back other people from
your time in the past

DAVID

If you can bring back other people why cant you bring back
HER

BLUE FAIRY

Because we can only bring back people whose bodies we dig up
from the ice We need some physical sample of the person
like a bone or a fingernail

TEDDY
David

DAVID
Yes Teddy

TEDDY
Do you remember when you cut some of Mommys hair

DAVID
Henry shook me

TEDDY
And you dropped her hair

DAVID
I know

Now you can bring her back cant you

SPECIALIST OBSERVATION ROOM

SPECIALIST (NARRATOR)
Give him what he wants

MARTINS BEDROOM

BLUE FAIRY
Dearest David your wish is my command

DAVIDS BEDROOM

DAVID
Hey Joe what do you know

SPECIALIST (NARRATOR)

David I often felt a sort of envy of human beings and that
thing they call spirit Human beings had created a million
explanations of the meaning of life in art in poetry in
mathematical formulas Certainly human beings must be the
key to the meaning of existence but human beings no longer
existed

So we began a project that would make it possible to
recreate the living body of a person long dead from the DNA
in a fragment of bone or mummified skin We also wondered
would it be possible to retrieve a memory trace in resonance
with a recreated body And do you know what we found We
found the very fabric of space-time itself appeared to
store information about every event which had ever occured
in the past

But the experiment was a failure For those who were
resurrected only lived through a single day of renewed life
When the resurrectees fell asleep on the night of their
first new day they died again As soon as they became
unconscious their very existence faded away into darkness
So you see David the equations have shown that once an
individual space-time pathway had been used it could not be
reused If we bring your mother back now it will only be
for one day and then youll never be able to see her again

DAVID

Maybemaybe she will be special maybe she will stay
SPECIALIST (NARRATOR)

I thought this might be hard for you to understand You were

created to be so young

DAVID
Maybe the one day will be like that one day inside the
amphibicopter maybe it will last forever

SPECIALIST (NARRATOR)

David you are the enduring memory of the human race the
most lasting proof of their genius We only want for your
happiness David youve had so little of that

DAVID
If you want for my happiness then you know what you have to
do

SPECIALIST (NARRATOR)
Listen Can you hear that The new morning has come Go to
her David shes just waking up this instant

MASTER BEDROOM

DAVID
I found you

MONICA
Hi

MONICA
I mustve dozed off How long have I-

DAVID
Would you like some coffee Just the way you like it

MONICA

DAVID
Okay

MONICA
You never forget how do you

DAVID
No I never forget

MONICA
I must be a little confused What day is it
DAVID
It istoday

MASTER BATHROOM

NARRATOR

And as the day wore on David thought it was the happiest
day of his life All the problems seemed to have disappeared
from his mommys mind There was no Henry there was no
Martin there was no grief there was only David

DAVID and MONICA
(Laughter)

NARRATOR

David had been warned not to explain anything to Monica
otherwise she would become frightened and everything would
be spoiled But Davids journey home belonged only to him
so he didnt see the harm of painting her pictures of things
she would have no memory of

NARRATOR
David had never had a birthday party because David had
never been born So they baked a cake and lit some candles

MONICA
Now make a wish

DAVID
It came true already

NARRATOR
By now indeed the windows were beginning to dim David drew
the shades without even needing to be asked
MASTER BEDROOM

MONICA

I really ought to be tucking you in Strange HmmHow
fascinating I can hardly keep my eyes open I dont know
whats come over me Such a beautiful day I love you David
I do love you I have always loved you

NARRATOR

That was the everlasting moment he had been waiting for And
the moment had passed for Monica was sound asleep - more
than merely asleep Should he shake her she would never
rouse So David went to sleep too And for the first time in
his life he went to that place where dreams are born

THE END
