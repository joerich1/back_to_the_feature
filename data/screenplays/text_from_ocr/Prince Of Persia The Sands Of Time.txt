EXT MOUNTAIN PASS - NIGHT
SUPER PERSIA - THE NINTH CENTURY

Two PERSIAN SOLDIERS man a lonely sentry post They rub
their hands over a sputtering fire

OLDER SOLDIER
Your turn to gather more firewood

YOUNG SOLDIER
It’s always my turn

OLDER SOLDIER
(grins )
You’re learning

The YOUNG SOLDIER pulls his cloak tighter and trudges off
resigned

The OLDER SOLDIER stamps his feet and sneaks a swig from his
wineskin to ward off the chill A horse whinnies and he
looks up

A CARAVAN approaches in the moonlight four shrouded FIGURES
leading horses and wagons

The Old Soldier picks up his spear and steps into the road

OLDER SOLDIER (CONTD)
Halt in the name of the Persian
Army What is your business

CARAVAN LEADER
We are Bedouin traders sir on our

way home We humbly beg leave to
pass

The Caravan Leader bows respectfully He wears a black head
covering that conceals most of his face

OLDER SOLDIER
Smugglers have been using this road
to take weapons to our enemies
IN THE WOODS - THE YOUNG SOLDIER

Returns with an arm load of fire wood

AT THE CHECKPOINT
The Older Soldier approaches the wagons

CARAVAN LEADER
We take no sides in your wars

OLDER SOLDIER
Nevertheless my orders are to
inspect all cargo

CARAVAN LEADER
If you insist

The Older Soldier pulls back the canvas tarp covering one of
the wagons It is filled with SWORDS SHIELDS and ARMAMENTS

The Soldier’s eyes go wide He wheels around

In a flash the CARAVAN LEADER plunges a SCIMITAR into his
stomach

ON THE YOUNG SOLDIER

Arriving just in time to see his comrade slain The
SMUGGLERS leap onto their horses and ride off

A beat He drops the firewood and races to the guard hut
He lifts a RAM’S HORN to his lips and blows with all his
might

A long powerful note carries over to

EXT MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT

The SMUGGLERS whip their horses mercilessly A wagon wheel
hits a rock and pitches over spilling blades and shields

LEADER
Leave it

WE HEAR a growing thunder in the distance Horsemen riding
hard The smugglers redouble their pace on the perilous
road

But the Persian SOLDIERS are closing furiously An arrow
whistles past The smugglers abandon their caravan now and
simply flee for their lives

It’s no use In moments the squad of Persian SOLDIERS is on
top of them Swords hooves and men clash on the narrow
mountain road
A torch is knocked to the ground-- a smuggler’s horse rears
up at the flames The rider loses control and topples
screaming into the canyon below

The Leader sees his fellows fall and wheels his horse to make
a break for it He strikes down a Persian soldier from
behind and charges past

As he gallops away the YOUNG SOLDIER from the outpost leaps
from his saddle and draws his bow He squints aims and
THWWWWWWIP fires into the darkness

The soldiers peer into the gloom A beat Then the
riderless horse trots back into view

CUT TO

EXT MOUNTAINSIDE - LATER

Several Persian SOLDIERS stand over the body of the Lead
Smuggler

YOUNG SOLDIER
Attention

The soldiers turn and bow as NIZAM (gray beard wise face)
rides up flanked by two guards His fine clothes and armor
reflect the fact that he’s a member of the ROYAL FAMILY

Nizam nods to the Young Soldier

NIZAM
At ease You did well to stop
these smugglers

Nizam dismounts and approaches the body of the Lead Smuggler
He rolls him over with his foot and notices something around
the dead man’s neck Nizam lifts it up a LEATHER SATCHEL

INT ROYAL PERSIAN ARMY TENT - NIGHT

Torchlight illuminates the richly appointed tent filled with
tapestries silk carpets and burnished gold

Prince TUS (the eldest son a fierce battle-hardened
commander) sits at the head of the table Next are the
twins FARHAD and FARHAN (identical equally fastidious
aristocrats)

A banquet is served Tus glances at an empty chair
TUS
Where is he

The TWINS shrug in unison The CAMERA FOLLOWS the sound of
men’s voices out the doorway of the tent toward

EXT ARMY CAMP - NIGHT

The COMMON SOLDIERS are spread out over the rough terrain
below Men carouse laugh and drink around the campfires

WE DRIFT TOWARD a group of soldiers clustered around a young
MAN lining up to throw a dagger at a crude target Shouts
from the onlookers “He won’t make it this time Come on
Dastan Shut up and let him concentrate” etc

DASTAN (early 20s the slim bearing of a natural athlete)
pays no attention He has a quiet calm confidence that
sets him apart from the others

In one quick fluid motion he throws KA-THUNK Bull’s eye

Cheers and groans from the crowd Money changes hands as
side bets are collected

Dastan accepts a drink of ale Somebody fetches his dagger
for him He puts it away

A hulking scary-looking SOLDIER steps drunkenly toward him

HULKING SOLDIER
You have to take one more throw
I’m down a month’s wages

Dastan puts a sympathetic hand on the brute’s shoulder

DASTAN
You bet against me didn’t you
Gargor

GARGOR
(ashamed)
It won’t happen again

He turns and tosses his coin purse on the rough table

GARGOR (CONT’D)
My entire purse says Dastan makes
the next throw Who will take the
bet
A soldier shouts out
SOLDIER
Only if he throws from farther
make it fifteen paces

An “ooooh” goes up from the crowd Fifteen is a long throw

DASTAN
Why not twenty

Whistles and catcalls twenty is a really long throw Money
flies onto the table to match Gargor’s

GARGOR
(nervous )
Can you hit the target from that
far
DASTAN
I’ve never tried
(smiles )
But if I do you’re going to clean
up

The distance is marked off It’s twice the last throw
Dastan takes another drink enjoying himself

He steps to the line A hush falls He flips the dagger in
his hand concentrating like a pitcher on the mound

Dastan takes aim throws KA-CHUNK The dagger sticks in
the target dead center A perfect throw

The MEN erupt Gargor lifts Dastan in a bear hug Then

HERALD (0S)
Prince Dastan Prince Dastan

The HERALD reins in his horse The celebration quiets down
as they notice him Gargor sets Dastan down

HERALD (CONTD)
Prince Dastan your brothers summon
you

Dastan brushes himself off He bows to the common soldiers
with mock formality

DASTAN
Gentlemen I take my leave of you
They laugh as he swings himself onto the Herald’s horse and
gallops off

INT PERSIAN ARMY TENT - NIGHT

Dastan takes his place beside his older brothers He looks
noticeably rougher around the edges The Twins sniff

FARHAN
(whispers )
Have you thought of bathing
recently Dastan

Dastan starts to reply but Tus snaps at them

TUS
Silence Our uncle has important
news

Nizam approaches and sets down the LEATHER SATCHEL he found
on the smuggler

NIZAM
Noble Princes we have won many
victories in these wars But we
have been unable to completely cut
off our enemy’s supply lines
Tonight our sentries intercepted
yet another smuggler’s caravan
filled with weapons

He pulls a sheaf of parchment from the LEATHER SATCHEL

NIZAM (CONTD)
But this time we have captured
papers that tell us the identity of
our enemy’s secret ally

The four PRINCES crane to see

NIZAM (CONTD)
It is the kingdom of Alamut that
has been arming our foe

TUS
(frowns )
Alamut Our father the King has
always said it was a Holy City
Not to be touched
NIZAM
That is because your father did not
know the truth

Nizam points to a map with Arabic calligraphy

NIZAM (CONTD)
Alamut is two days hence If you
wish to strike before we march
homeward now is your opportunity

Farhan clears his throat-- his brother speaks

FARHAD
Does Alamut have treasure

FARHAN
He’s only asking because it has
been a long campaign

FARHAD
We’re thinking of the men

FARHAN
Exactly

NIZAM
Treasure Food Beautiful women
Alamut is renowned for them

DASTAN
Our father did not send us to fight
for plunder Nor did he send us to
fight Alamut

NIZAM
Well said Dastan But the friend
of our enemy is our enemy

Tus deliberates

TUS
My father taught me when you cut
down a tree you must pluck up the
root

(looks to Nizam)

I‘1l need evidence to convince my
father that Alamut has taken our
enemy’s side
NIZAM
The evidence lies within the walls
of Alamut itself secret forges
swords spears but Alamut is a
mighty Citadel It has never
fallen Prince Tus

He bows deeply Tus makes his decision
TUS

It has never faced an army like
ours

EXT ROCKY SLOPE - SUNRISE

WE HEAR the metallic clink of armor the thud of boots on
hard ground and horses The morning fog clears TO REVEAL

THE PERSIAN ARMY on the move

Thousands of men and horses Catapults cavalry archers A
stunning fearsome sight

Ahead in the shadow of the mountain a massive fortress
rises from the mist like the home of the gods

THE CITADEL OF ALAMUT Ancient mysterious and impregnable

The common soldiers at Dastan’s side look shaken and make
superstitious gestures to ward off evil

FEARFUL SOLDIER
They say the Alamut are sorcerers
Black magic

DASTAN
I expect they’re flesh and bone
like us

Dastan rides ahead to join his older brothers on the ridge
completing a quartet of horsemen

The PRINCES gaze at Alamut for the first time
FARHAD

We’re going to get dirty aren’t
we
DASTAN
You only get dirty if you actually
fight Do that and I’1l1 polish
your armor for you
FARHAN
(looks Dastan up and down)
You’d do better to polish your own

TUS
Come Let’s make our father proud

They gallop off

INT BEDROOM IN ROYAL PALACE - SUNRISE

Gossamer curtains billow in the breeze A girl tosses in
fitful sleep Smooth limbs long black hair -- the darkness
offers only a tantalizing hint of the beauty that is TAMINA

A GONG rings out Tamina awakens alarmed

EXT RAMPARTS - SUNRISE

A SENTRY beats a giant GONG ALAMUT SOLDIERS run past
shouting in Foreign

EXT BELOW THE CITADEL - SUNRISE

THE PERSIAN ARMY charges up the wide shaly slope

Tus galloping ahead lifts his sword and lets out a WAR CRY
From the ranks rises a blood-curdling NOISE as thousands of

voices join him Then

A FLAMING ARROW is fired from the ramparts All eyes turn
skyward to follow its arc

At its apex the arrow suddenly EXPLODES into a shower of
brilliant white fireworks illuminating the attacking army

DASTAN
Is mesmerized the Persians have never seen gunpowder before

Suddenly an ARROW fells the man next to him Dastan
instinctively raises his shield blocking another ARROW

AT THE WALLS

The first wave of Persian footsoldiers reaches the citadel
Ladders are thrown up men scale the walls--

ALAMUT SOLDIERS rise from the ramparts to repel them with
arrows pole-axes and burning oil A classic medieval siege

ON THE BATTLEFIELD

The second wave of Persians prepares to advance when
suddenly they start being picked off by arrows

Dastan spots the problem -- ALAMUT SABOTEURS clad in black
like ninjas have emerged from secret hiding places in the
rocks on either side of them

DASTAN
The enemy among us

Dastan gallops toward a SABOTEUR who’s just doused a Persian
catapult with oil to burn it Leaping from horseback onto
the catapult Dastan strikes the torch from the man’s hand
before he can light it

They clash swords The Saboteur an intimidating spectre
swathed in black is a formidable swordsman But Dastan holds
his own with surprising skill

A SECOND SABOTEUR joins in Despite Dastan’s speed and
agility the two Saboteurs inexorably force him up onto the
catapult platform While 1 keeps him busy 2 lights a
torch The catapult BURSTS INTO FLAMES

Dastan battles on with determination heedless of the FLAMES
rising around him At last he turns the tables and knocks
both Saboteurs off the platform into the flames

A moment of satisfaction

Then Dastan sees the TIE ROPE burning Uh oh He looks
down realizes what he’s standing on

Just as the ROPE BURNS THROUGH

The catapult arm FLINGS Dastan into the air He soars toward
the ramparts

EXT RAMPARTS - DAY

Alamut SOLDIERS fighting off the invaders look up to see an
enemy soldier hurtling toward them like a cannonball

Whizzing over their heads Dastan makes a desperate grab at a
passing canvas awning It RIPS -- but slows his flight as he
tears through a series of canvas awnings one after another

Dastan’s amazed he’s survived until
He runs out of awnings Confronted with a FATAL DROP to the
next rampart he saves himself by grabbing the torn canvas of

the last awning

On the rampart below a trio of ARCHERS take aim Dastan
dangles in space a prime target

Pushing off the stone wall with his feet he struggles to
climb the torn canvas The first volley of arrows barely
misses him Dastan climbs faster As he nears the top
The canvas RIPS -- dropping him further than before and
SLAMMING him into the wall (Thanks to which the second
volley misses him too)

Dastan gets a new idea He starts to “run” back and forth
along the wall swinging on the canvas to gain momentum

The cloth RIPS more Not good He’s hanging by a thread

His eye is on a nearby parapet if he can swing to it

EXT CITADEL GATE - DAY

Persian soldiers on the narrow bridge leading to the citadel
run a BATTERING RAM into the iron gate Heave-ho BAM

And again BAM The battering ram SMASHES through the gate
The triumphant horde storms through the vaulted entrance--

Only to find themselves confronted by a SECOND GATE A
TORRENT OF ARROWS is unleashed on them from above Theyre
trapped by the men rushing in it’s a slaughter

EXT RAMPART - DAY
Running on the wall Dastan swings almost within reach of the
parapet just misses it He swings back the other way an

ARROW grazes him

Below him two more ARCHERS join the firing squad They load
their bows

With determination Dastan backs up as far as he can for the
final swing the one that has to make it

As he’s swinging toward the parapet his canvas “rope”
BREAKS Dastan sails through the air

Grabs for the parapet misses it plummets toward earth
And brilliantly saves himself by grabbing a window ledge
below Scrambles through just escaping a hail of ARROWS
INT GUARD TOWER - DAY

Dastan lands in a stone corridor FIVE ALAMUT SOLDIERS
converge on him He draws his sword

And now we see Dastan fighting in his element His style is
medieval Parkour Parkour is a blend of extreme sport and
martial art developed on the streets of Paris Dastan uses
walls railings statuary-- anything he can bounce grab or
roll off of for an advantage Fighting him is like trying to
grab hold of a bar of soap

Dastan runs to the edge looks down over the parapet

HIS POV The main bridge below clogged with soldiers

Beside him thick rope cables rise from an open SHAFT

ALAMUT SOLDIER (IN FOREIGN)
Stop him

As the soldiers descend on him Dastan jumps onto the main
CABLE and does a fireman’s slide to the platform below
INT GUARD CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Dastan lands GUARDS rush him He flips one sends the next
plummeting down the shaft -- grabs a crank lever--

ALAMUT SOLDIER (IN FOREIGN)
NO

Dastan THROWS the lever releasing the crank which TURNS--

EXT CITADEL ENTRANCE - DAY

A CHEER erupts from the horde of Persian soldiers as the GATE
RAISES Men pour into the citadel

OUTSIDE THE GATE
TUS stares in disbelief as the bridge empties of men

TUS
To the bridge

FROM ALL SIDES soldiers pour onto the narrow bridge

INT BEDROOM IN ROYAL PALACE - DAY
Tamina gazes out the window A HANDMAID bursts in
HANDMAID
My Lady We must flee The

invaders have breached the gate

TAMINA
What How did this happen

HANDMATD
There is no time-- you must save
yourself

TAMINA
There is far more at stake than my
safety

The Handmaid bows her head in acknowledgment Tamina remains
calm and self-possessed

TAMINA (CONTD)
Send word to collapse the passages
to the Hourglass And have the
dagger brought to me

HANDMATD
Yes my lady

EXT CITADEL MAIN COURTYARD - DAY

A courtyard of austere and exotic Eastern beauty At the far
end stands a temple with a sacred FOUNTAIN guarded by stone
lions -- all carved out of a massive block of pure white

marble

A flood of Persian soldiers soon overwhelms the defenders

EXT CITY STREETS - DAY

Civilians flee screaming through narrow stone streets

EXT INSIDE THE CITADEL - DAY
The twins fight side by side without breaking a sweat

Nizam rides through the enemy troops wielding two swords at
once with a deadly dexterity surprising for a man his age

Tus hacking his way to victory pauses --

TUS
Where’s Dastan

EXT ANOTHER RAMPART - DAY

Dastan emerges onto a quiet rampart -- a narrow trench
between two high walls The battle has not yet reached this
part of the castle

A FLASH OF LIGHT catches Dastan’s eye he looks up at an
arched window where somebody is signalling with a small hand
mirror a fleeting glimpse of a beautiful female silhouette
behind a sheer curtain Tamina

Then HOOFBEATS Dastan turns to see a mighty ALAMUT
WARRIOR galloping toward him on an armored stallion

Dastan’s trapped between the walls The corridor is too
narrow for him to escape He’s about to be trampled

The WARRIOR draws a scimitar

At the last instant Dastan runs straight up the wall-- pushes
off with a backflip and lands ON THE HORSE

The two men GRAPPLE on horseback Sparks fly as armor and
weapons scrape the stone walls at full gallop

They fight -- Dastan getting the worst of it as his more
heavily-armored opponent pounds him mercilessly The Alamut
warrior raises his sword to finish Dastan once and for all

Dastan throws his arms around the warrior’s waist dragging
him from the saddle The two men crash to the ground

As they roll to a halt and fall apart WE SEE that Dastan has
managed to turn the warrior’s blade at the last second-- so
that he has been impaled on impact instead of Dastan

The warrior is dying but with the last of his strength he
reaches for something tucked into his waistband Dastan
prepares to defends himself then realizes he’s in no danger

The warrior clutches a cloth-wrapped bundle in his hand He
tries to speak Dastan cranes closer to hear his last words
Too late He’s dead

TAMINA’S POV - from a window above she looks down and sees
Dastan kneeling over the body

The warrior’s fingers uncurl the bundle slips from his hand
and out rolls a ceremonial DAGGER with a glass handle
encrusted with precious stones Ancient and otherwordly as
if it had been made by the gods not men

Dastan picks it up The glass handle is half-filled with a
fine white sand so naturally bright it glows Dastan tilts
it curiously the way you might tilt an hourglass

Dastan tucks the dagger in his belt a war trophy

ON TAMINA - her eyes burn with fury as she watches Dastan’s
clothes are charred and torn from his escapades She did not
see him slay the warrior and thus takes him for the lowest
sort of thief one who loots the bodies of the dead for easy
plunder

EXT CITADEL MAIN COURTYARD - DAY

Dastan emerges and spots his brothers conferring with Nizam
amidst the crowd of soldiers He approaches

TUS
Dastan Where have you been

DASTAN
Tus I opened the gate

Tus in a bad mood snaps--
TUS
Every man here played his part
Don’t take credit for their
bravery

The Twins snicker at Dastan Tus turns back to the others

TUS (CONT’D)
No word yet on the secret armories

NIZAM
The search has only just begun
Prince Tus If you like I will
stay behind and continue to look--

TUS
No I’m not going back to face my
father without proof I’11 stay to
conduct the search for these
weapons myself

There is an edge to his voice that warns them not to argue

EXT GATES OF ALAMUT - DAY

Persian soldiers load horse and camel drawn wagons with
looted gold and treasure in preparation for the journey home

Alamut prisoners are sorted into groups and selected as
slaves for transport

An OFFICER inspects a group of captive YOUNG WOMEN Among
them is Tamina her fine dress concealed under a drab cloak

Tamina keeps her head down The officer lifts her chin to
get a good look at her face

OFFICER
Let’s see your hands

Tamina shows one hand The Officer yanks the other into
view WE SEE that she has palmed her ornate RING slipping it
unnoticed into the folds of her cloak The OFFICER herds her
into a line of captives being loaded onto a wagon

AT THE HEAD OF THE CARAVAN
DASTAN packs his horse’s saddlebags His brother approaches
TUS
Where is your share of the

treasure Dastan

DASTAN
I fight for glory not for plunder

TUS
That’s very noble younger brother
but what gift will you bring to our
father

Dastan hesitates he hadn’t thought of that

DASTAN
Our father doesn’t expect gifts
from me

The Twins pause from overseeing the mountain of gold and
coins being loaded onto their wagons to laugh at Dastan

Tus silences them with a look He turns sternly to Dastan

TUS
It’s not about what he expects
it’s about showing proper respect
You’re no longer a child Dastan

Tus walks over to one of his own wagons and selects a
gorgeous embroidered silk ROBE He hands it to Dastan

TUS (CONTD)
Be a good son Give him this

The twins roll their eyes-- there goes Tus bailing Dastan
out Nizam on the other hand watches approvingly

DASTAN
(grateful)
Thank you brother

EXT CENTRAL ASIAN VALLEY - ANOTHER DAY

The caravan of Persian SOLDIERS HORSES and CAMELS wends its
way down from the mountains into the plain

Dastan sits backward in his saddle reading a book Nizam
rides up alongside

NIZAM
Your brother is right you know
You shouldn’t come home from a
battle empty-handed

DASTAN
I didn’t come away empty-handed

He shows Nizam the DAGGER with the glass handle Nizam
inspects it with interest Hands it back

NIZAM

Very nice But you should consider
your future Dastan

(a touch of bitterness)
You were unlucky in birth-- like
me born last Those of us not
destined to inherit our fortune
must earn it

Dastan puts away his book and turns around in the saddle
DASTAN

I am more interested in great deeds
and adventure than great fortune

uncle

NIZAM
Youve had plenty of both on this
campaign

DASTAN

Hardly the stuff of legend We win
because we have my father’s army
The army he built with his life’s
blood starting from nothing That
was an accomplishment

He leans toward Nizam and lowers his voice his eyes burning
with excitement

DASTAN (CONTD)
Do you know what I want To set
forth from home with no army just
one horse and a good sword and no
one knowing I am the son of
Shahraman Then my achievements
may be small-- but they’1l be mine
And I can bring them home to him
with pride

NIZAM
(with a twinkle)
Dastan I have misjudged you I
thought you the most modest of my
nephews In fact you are the most
ambitious

Nizam winks at him and spurs his horse onward

EXT NASAF - SUNSET

The sun sets behind the gleaming spires and domes of the
royal city of NASAF TILT DOWN to REVEAL the dusty caravan
finally arriving home

The returning soldiers are met by a cheering crowd

The Captain of the Guards GARSIV (a young hotshot) stands at
attention for the returning nobles His expression sours
when Dastan comes abreast of him the two are about the same
age and clearly have some history

GARSIV
No injuries Dastan Didn’t your
brothers let you fight

DASTAN
Hardly at all Garsiv I’m very
rusty maybe you’ll be able to beat
me in the tournament this year
Finally

Dastan smiles tauntingly and rides past

INT BANQUET HALL - LATER

A magnificent eighth century palace with high vaulted
ceilings and tiled mosaics

Musicians play flutes and tambourines beautiful slaves
circulate serving delicacies to the guests (all male)
seated on cushions at low tables

TAMINA

Is part of a group of newbie SLAVE GIRLS being prepped by a
stern MATRON who makes last minute adjustments to each girl’s
(scanty) attire before sending her out with an hors d’oeuvre
tray

The Matron frowns at Tamina’s outfit tugs at it to reveal
more cleavage Tamina indignant seems about to slap her --
then remembering where she is submits Her face burns as
the Matron sends her forth with a pat on the ass

FOLLOW the slave girls as they mix into the crowd and MOVE
PAST them to a roped-off royal dais where

DASTAN

Tears into a chicken leg with gusto The Twins eating with
elegant delicacy shoot him twin looks of disgust

FARHAD
You eat like a common foot-soldier

DASTAN
Foot-soldiers know how to enjoy a
good meal when they get one
Bismillah

Dastan halts mid-bite as he sees

TAMINA across the room He is mesmerized by the sight of
her He drops his chicken and starts toward hex

ON TAMINA

As she struggles under the weight of the tray It is
unexpectedly lifted from her hands by

DASTAN (CONTD)
Allow me

With a flourish he swings the tray to a nearby table comes
up with two goblets of wine and offers one to her

DASTAN (CONTD)
I’m Dastan

Her eyes go wide with recognition he interprets her reaction
as fear of being caught chatting with a guest

DASTAN (CONTD)
Don’t worry you won’t get in
trouble for talking to me I’m the
King’s son

TAMINA (IN FOREIGN)
I have seen you before you son of
a dog I curse your eyes

Dastan laughs modestly not comprehending a word

DASTAN
Please-- there’s no need to thank
me You’ve been working hard you
deserve a rest

(leans close)

Just for the record I don’t
support the practice of enslaving
the people we conquer

(MORE )

DASTAN (CONTD)
Personally I think it’s an old-
fashioned and barbaric custom

Tamina’s eyes go to the DAGGER in his belt

TAMINA (IN FOREIGN)
You steal from the dead and deface
what is holy

DASTAN
«nor should you let the fact that
I’m a Prince intimidate you I’m
sure it sounds very impressive but
I’m only a fourth son--

A FANFARE of TRUMPETS signals the start of the royal
procession Everybody surges forward to look Dastan and
Tamina are separated in the crowd

KING SHAHRAMAN enters with his entourage Gray-bearded and
broad-shouldered his very presence commands respect All
bow deeply as he passes

SHAHRAMAN
(embracing Nizam)
My dear brother Your wise counsel
has brought us victory

NIZAM
No it is your sons who have
brought honor and glory to the
banner of Nasaf

Shahraman sits and the others take their places on the dias
according to rank Garsiv stands sentry behind the throne
Tamina creeps closer through the crowd for a better view

SHAHRAMAN
(looks around)
Where is my eldest son

NIZAM
Tus has remained to bring order to
the lands conquered in your name
His brothers will convey his
greetings to you

The Twins step forward with elaborately ceremonial
simultaneous bows -- a bit over the top for Shahraman

FARHAD
My lord and father to see you is
like seeing the sun after the
longest night of winter Our noble
brother has entrusted me--

FARHAN

FARHAD
--has entrusted us with gifts

On cue TEN SLAVES enter bearing ten gold platters laden with
jewels their powerful muscles straining under the weight

FARHAN
And I bring gifts as well

FARHAD
We

FARHAN
We bring gifts

Twenty more slaves parade in bearing twenty golden platters
piled even higher than the first

FARHAN (CONTD)
Over treacherous mountains across
the burning desert we carried the
treasure--

FARHAD
--his as well as ours--

FARHAN
-- out of love for you

The Twins bow deeply

NIZAM
And your youngest son waits to
greet you as well

Shahraman breaks into a smile on seeing Dastan he has a
special fondness for this son Dastan throws himself into
his dad’s embrace hugs him hard

SHAHRAMAN
Dastan What mischief have you
been up to

DASTAN
Father I’ve brought you a gift

SHAHRAMAN
(affectionately)
Do you mean to say you haven’t lost
it or gambled it away

Dastan beckons to a pretty FEMALE SLAVE who appears carrying
a cloth bundle -- and in a nifty move shakes it out
unveiling the ROBE OF HONOR Everyone oohs

Shahraman takes the robe Runs his fingers over the gold-
embroidered silk He’s genuinely surprised and touched

SHAHRAMAN (CONTD)
Dastan this is unlike you I
shall wear it with pride

Attendants remove Shahraman’s robe and help him don the new
one The Twins seethe with jealousy at such favoritism

SHAHRAMAN (CONTD)
From which of a our conquered
kingdoms does this come

DASTAN
From Alamut father

SHAHRAMAN
Alamut

Shahraman’s face flushes with anger He turns--

SHAHRAMAN (CONTD)
Nizam You let them attack Alamut

Tamina watches with special interest as Nizam steps forward

NIZAM
Sire if you’1l hear me out--

SHAHRAMAN
You know that the kingdom of Alamut
is sacred That it is forbidden to
attack it Why were my orders
disobeyed

Nizam hangs his head at the rebuke

SHAHRAMAN (CONTD)
Speak

NIZAM
O King we were provoked we
discovered evidence that Alamut was
secretly supporting our enemy-- is
something wrong sire

The new robe suddenly seems to itch Shahraman he tugs at it
irritably

SHAHRAMAN
This robe is hot What evidence

NIZAM
We intercepted a smuggler’s
caravan The weapons came from--

DASTAN
Father

SHAHRAMAN
Take off the robe

Attendants hasten to remove the robe but cannot It won’t
come off-- it’s glued to his skin Shahraman ROARS in pain

DASTAN
Father

Shahraman lurches to his feet Like a maddened bull he
shakes off his attendants tearing at the robe STEAM hisses
from the burning places where it STICKS to his flesh

NIZAM
It’s poisoned

SHAHRAMAN
Take it off

Every one is shocked and horrified Dastan hurtles to his
father’s side Catches him as he falls staining his own
clothes with blood Shahraman is dying in agony with third
degree burns all over his body

SHAHRAMAN (CONTD)
My son

Garsiv rushes to help his king He shoves Dastan aside

GARSIV
Youve killed your father

DASTAN
What No I--

GARSIV
(shouts)
Prince Dastan has killed the king

Guards rip Dastan away from Shahraman While he struggles
Garsiv and other guards attempt to remove the King’s robe
but only intensify his death agony

DASTAN
(fighting to break free)
FATHER

Garsiv lowers Shahraman’s dead body to the ground He draws
his sword and points it at Dastan

GARSIV
Murderer

The Twins draw their swords as well All eyes are on Dastan

DASTAN
(choking back tears)
I didn’t do this
(looks around desperately)
Nizam Tell them

Nizam looks at him with shocked disappointment
NIZAM
That is for a tribunal to decide

Dastan

The guards begin to drag Dastan from the room Tamina edges
forward

With a sudden desperate burst of strength Dastan breaks
free He snatches a sword from one of the guards parries
the attack of another and

escapes through a small doorway behind the dais

In the confusion Tamina ducks out unnoticed through the
curtains on the same side of the room

EXT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Dastan runs for his life Footsteps and shouts behind him
As he races down the hallway he’s suddenly pulled into
INT LAUNDRY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

TAMINA

Drags him inside and slams the door shut behind him

DASTAN
What are you--

She throws open the window and tosses a sheet over the ledge
rapidly tying it to another She’s all business

TAMINA
Go

Dastan hesitates
BAM BAM Soldiers are at the door

TAMINA (CONTD)
Go

As Dastan climbs out the window Tamina reaches like a
pickpocket for the DAGGER in his belt

Unaware Dastan nimbly slips out the window just before she
can take it

EXT STABLES - NIGHT

Dastan slides down the sheet-rope and lands with a thud ina
pile of hay Tamina tumbles down after him

She leaps to her feet as Dastan struggles to his He looks
around and sees they are in the stables

DASTAN
I don’t even know your name Slave-
Girl but I thank you for your
help Now you should hide I must
flee at once and doubtless you
cannot even--

Tamina mounts a magnificent Arabian THOROUGHBRED and takes
off at a gallop

DASTAN (CONTD)
ride

Dastan stares for a moment Then the GUARDS burst out of the
doorway Dastan leaps onto the nearest available mount-- a
small and seemingly unimpressive horse-- and spurs it on

IN THE COURTYARD

A dozen of the King’s HORSEMEN led by Garsiv ride out
trapping Tamina and Dastan

They’re the best-trained most formidable military unit in
Persia Normally everyone flees from them Instead Dastan
rides straight at them

He dodges right -- then left -- and slips by Magic Johnson
on horseback The resulting moment of disarray lets Tamina
charge past on the other side and out the entrance

GARSIV
Close the gate

As the GUARDS relay Garsiv’s command like an echo the dozen
horsemen turn around as one to give chase

EXT PALACE MAIN GATE - NIGHT

The two fugitives gallop toward the great lowering iron
gate Garsiv’s posse on their heels

Tamina’s larger and faster horse gets there first Dastan
catches a glimpse of her nimbly swinging sideways in her
saddle to avoid decapitation as she rides under the closing
gate

Impressive But it looks like the gate will close before
Dastan gets there To make matters worse four FOOTSOLDIERS
range out in front of it with spears raised to impale him

Dastan’s eyes narrow Redoubling his speed he charges on
and SHATTERS a spear with his sword opening space to pass

He swings halfway off his horse and narrowly squeezes
through The gate closes sealing in Garsiv’s men

GARSIV
Open the gate

The soldiers raise the gate they just closed Garsiv’s
posse which has swelled to forty riders charges through

EXT CITY IN THE DESERT - NIGHT

Dastan and Tamina gallop out of the walled city and strike
out toward the hills with the king’s men in pursuit

A full moon illuminates the rough terrain Tamina leads the
way over a series of increasingly treacherous jumps

DASTAN
(amazed)
Where did you learn to ride like
that

Two pursuing horsemen fall jumping the boulders The others
press closer

An ARROW whistles past Dastan’s head He looks over his
shoulder sees the posse gaining on him He urges the little
horse to greater speed but he’s outclassed

Inexorably the first ARCHER draws even with Dastan He
shoots Dastan drops from sight The archer seeing Dastan’s
horse riderless is momentarily confused -- did he hit him
No Dastan is clinging to the saddle on the other side
shielded by the horse’s body

GARSIV
Shoot the horse

Dastan half upside-down registers alarm on hearing this
As the archer fires Dastan pops back up in his saddle and
pulls up the reins -- causing the arrow to miss

Dastan escapes into a narrow GULLY forcing his pursuers to
follow single file

Descending the steep gully Dastan discovers the true gift of
his undersized mount -- he’s a mountain horse The sure-
footed animal rapidly regains the ground he lost Recklessly
tackling the treacherous slope Dastan emerges onto a broad
plateau -- ahead of Tamina

Dastan’s pursuers benefit from the shortcut as well As they
pour out of the gully they land right on Tamina She weaves
trying to shake them but can’t escape

Dastan looks back sees Tamina in trouble He slows A
mistake Within moments he too is boxed in by soldiers on
all sides He can’t get to Tamina

To Dastan’s left runs the sheer canyon wall As his horse
draws up alongside it he STANDS perching on the saddle like
a circus rider -- then RUNS up the wall using the horse’s
galloping momentum to GRAB an overhanging shrub The
soldiers are left herding a riderless horse

Dastan launches off the wall and DROPS onto one of the riders
harassing Tamina shoves him out of the saddle and takes his
place Drawing his sword he fights his way toward Tamina
knocking off the soldiers one by one

Suddenly Dastan’s trapped between two riders Garsiv on his
left another on his right In a blinding series of sword-
clashes Garsiv forces Dastan to parry repeatedly leaving
himself wide open to the soldier on his right

TAMINA
Dastan look out

Dastan BLOCKS the right-hand soldier’s blow in the nick of
time Garsiv turns to see Tamina riding up on his own left

Dastan doesn’t waste a moment He scrambles across Garsiv’s
saddle and joins Tamina on hers Garsiv spins furiously to
stop him-- too slow

They take off at a gallop

DASTAN
(to Tamina)
You have more than repaid the small
kindness I showed you

Both halves of the posses are closing in on them Up ahead
the plateau drops off in a SHEER CLIFF

Dastan spots his small horse running loose Taking the reins
from Tamina he draws up alongside and JUMPS into the
saddle He reaches out to Tamina

DASTAN (CONTD)
Come on Jump

TAMINA
This horse is faster

DASTAN
Yes but it’s not a mountain horse
Trust me jump

Tamina hesitates then JUMPS from her horse to his Dastan
catches her and hauls her up into the saddle

As the soldiers close in Dastan turns to face the cliff

TAMINA
What are you doing

Dastan sets his jaw Gallops straight toward the edge --
And LEAPS out into empty space

The cliff is not quite sheer just very steep Incredibly
the horse hits the nearly vertical slope at a gallop --
straight downhill

All the King’s horses stop at the edge Garsiv in a frenzy
beats his horse urging it on But it refuses to continue

Dastan and Tamina hang on as the sure-footed mountain horse
gallops down skirting rocks and potholes where a single
misstep could mean death until they reach the canyon floor

Garsiv stranded at the top of the cliff watches in helpless
fury as his quarry disappears into the canyon

EXT CANYON FLOOR - NIGHT

Tamina sits astride the horse as it drinks from the stream
Dastan kneels by the riverbank a little ways off It’s the
first time he’s had a chance to say a prayer for his father

Tamina watches as he wipes his eye then walks back toward
her

TAMINA
I don’t understand you pray for
the father you murdered

DASTAN
(hard)
I didn’t murder my father I was
framed

TAMINA
You gave him the poisoned robe

DASTAN
which my elder brother Tus gave to
me

Dastan takes some oats from the saddle bag and begins hand
feeding the horse Tamina dismounts

TAMINA
So your brother killed him to gain
the throne

DASTAN
(shakes his head)
My brother is a good man Somebody
else could have poisoned the robe

TAMINA
Who Who else could have done it

That is the question Dastan thinks hard

DASTAN
Only the twins and my uncle Nizam
knew of the robe but my brothers
are too stupid and Nizam
(rejects the idea)

My father owed his life to Nizam
since they were young They were
as close as two brothers could be

TAMINA
(softly)
That leaves you

Dastan is startled as if he’d forgotten she was there

DASTAN
If that’s what you think then why
did you help me--

As he turns to face her Tamina swings a SWORD right at him
Dastan dodges by sheer reflex the blow glances off his
armor sending him sprawling

He rolls avoiding a stamping horse’s hoof that would have
split his skull He scrambles to his feet drawing his sword
in time to BLOCK Tamina’s next blow

DASTAN (CONTD)
What are you doing

Tamina attacks without mercy Dastan his arm deadened from
the first hit struggles to defend himself

Tamina is good but not quite a match for Dastan With each
failed attack Dastan recovers ground until Tamina has lost
her initial surprise advantage

Dastan counter-attacks with blinding speed -- he’s not trying
to kill Tamina just disarm her Finally he strikes the
sword from her hand

DASTAN (CONTD)
Who taught you how to use a sword
like that

Tamina surprises him with a KICK in the belly Seizing
Dastan’s arm she sweeps his legs out from under him They
hit the ground together grappling on the riverbank

Tamina sees an opening pulls the dagger from Dastan’s belt
He grabs her wrist flips her The dagger goes flying

Tamina pushes him off her scrambles toward the dagger
Dastan gets there first He snatches it up--

CLICK Grasping it he’s pressed a JEWEL on the dagger’s
glass handle A trickle of white SAND spills out and lands
at his feet He looks down surprised

WHAM THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE WARPS

TIME slows to a STOP the dagger frozen in Dastan’s hand
The law of physics itself is suspended dust and water
droplets hang in midair The only element of the scene that
remains in motion is the white-glowing sand as it hits the
ground a gust of WIND blows it away

REWIND

TIME RUNS BACKWARD reversing the previous action Faster

and faster -- Tamina and Dastan fight in reverse their
movements accelerating backward in a BLUR -- until --
DASTAN

Staring amazed at the dagger clenched in his hand suddenly
relaxes his tight grip The instant he releases the jewel
the sand stops pouring out -- and

THE REWIND STOPS

EXT CANYON FLOOR - NIGHT SECOND TIME

Dastan and Tamina are beside the horse again as they were
the first time Tamina is repeating

TAMINA
«SO your brother killed him to gain
the throne

Dastan jumps away in confusion and terror scattering oats
He backs away from Tamina as if she’s a witch

TAMINA (CONTD)
What’s wrong

DASTAN
You--—

Turning he points to the dusty patch of ground where they
were just fighting Or were they

Tamina is equally perplexed but for a different reason she
does not remember the rewind Dastan looks down at his empty
hand -- then at the dagger which inexplicably is back in
his belt

And looks up to see Tamina’s SWORD flashing toward him
Disoriented by what’s happened Dastan is slower to react
this time the blade SLASHES him across the chest

Dastan looks down at the spreading stain of BLOOD soaking his
tunic He takes a step forward buckles falls to his knees

DASTAN (CONTD)
Who are you

Tamina draws herself up imperiously takes out the RING she’s
kept hidden and puts it on her finger

TAMINA
I am Tamina daughter of Sarkander
King of Alamut

DASTAN
(mortally wounded)
What magic

He looks down at the dagger in his belt Draws it

TAMINA
Give back what you have stolen

Dastan studies the dagger The jewel gleams on its hilt
just above where a hand would normally grasp the dagger But
if he grasps it this way as he did when he snatched it up

TAMINA (CONTD)

Don’t
She makes a grab for the dagger -- Dastan presses the jewel
CLICK Again sand pours from the handle -- STOPPING TIME

REWIND Back through time reversing the preceding action--

This time Dastan is more aware of what’s happening It’s as
if he’s stepped outside himself outside space and time into
a different dimension from which he can watch the rewind He
looks down at the dagger in his hand -- just as the last of
the sand drains out leaving the glass handle empty

EXT CANYON FLOOR - NIGHT THIRD TIME
TIME RESUMES a moment before Tamina swings her sword at him

This time Dastan draws his sword and blocks the blow She
tries to duel him but he’s the stronger swordsman He
disarms her and sends her sprawling to the ground

He glances down -- to his amazement his wound has vanished

DASTAN
I don’t want to hurt you but if
you reach for that sword I will
stop you before you stab me again

TAMINA
“Again”

Her gaze flies to the dagger in Dastan’s belt
TAMINA (CONTD)
The dagger you’ve used up all the
sand

Dastan checks the dagger Indeed its glass handle is empty

DASTAN
How did you know

TAMINA
Everybody from Alamut knows the
myth of that dagger

DASTAN
What myth

Tamina hesitates then bows down and changes the subject

TAMINA
Forgive me for striking at you
Prince I’m merely a foolish Slave-
Girl who sought to escape

Dastan looks down realizing she has no memory of having

revealed her true identity to him only the person holding
the DAGGER recalls the re-wind

A smile creeps over Dastan’s face as he watches her grovel
DASTAN

I will forgive you Come we
cannot stay here

INT CAVE - LATER
Tamina sweats building up the fire while Dastan lounges
DASTAN
That’s enough wood Come over
here my boots are dirty

Her eyes burn into him if looks could kill

DASTAN (CONTD)
Is something wrong Slave-Girl

TAMINA
(through gritted teeth)
No my lord

She kneels to clean his boots Dastan examines the dagger
DASTAN
A dagger that can turn back time
what else does your legend say
She scrubs intently at an invisible patch of dirt
TAMINA
Only that it is worthless now that
it’s empty

Dastan watches her out of the corner of his eye-- he knows
she’s lying

He yanks his boot away and marches toward the exit

DASTAN
Come It will be light soon We
must head to Zashad to hire a guide
for the desert crossing

She scrambles to her feet

EXT CANYON FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER
Dastan is already saddling the horse

TAMINA
Where are we going

DASTAN
To Alamut to confront my brother

Tamina hurries after Dastan who is already saddling the
horse

TAMINA
(a look of panic)
Alamut But it’s not safe If
your older brother did indeed
poison that robe--

DASTAN
Then I will find the truth About
my brother about my father’s
murder and about this dagger All
the answers are in Alamut

He tucks the dagger firmly into his waistband

DASTAN (CONTD)
Unless there’s more you wish to
tell me about it

Tamina shakes her head silently

DASTAN (CONTD)
As I suspected

Dastan picks up her up by the waist and unceremoniously dumps
her in the saddle She has no time to protest because he
then swings up into the saddle behind her and spurs the
horse

INT PALACE OF NASAF - DAY

Garsiv strides in dusty from the chase Nizam and the Twins
look up from their conference

GARSIV
My lords he has the luck of the
devil himself

FARHAD
Was it his luck or your failure

FARHAN
The King’s Guards against one
solitary man

GARSIV
He wasn’t alone my Prince there
was a girl

As soon as the words are out of his mouth Garsiv regrets
them His face burns with shame

NIZAM
(sadly)
If only he hadn’t fled

FARHAD
If he fled then he’s guilty

FARHAN
If he’s guilty he must be punished
Apprehend him

NIZAM
As you wish Princes Garsiv
prepare a full regiment this time

GARSIV
Right away my lord

Garsiv is out for blood Nizam notes his eagerness

NIZAM
I myself will accompany the search
party to make sure Prince Dastan is
treated with justice
(turns to the Twins)
Tus is our king now Until he
returns you rule Nasaf

FARHAD
(delighted)
I rule
FARHAN
I rule

Nizam hesitates as he looks from one to the other then on
second thought simply settles into a smile

NIZAM
Precisely

EXT VILLAGE OF ZASHAD - DAY

A sleepy little foothill town on the edge of the desert
Today it is overrun with SOLDIERS OF NASAF going house-to-
house searching for anyone remotely matching Dastan or
Tamina’s description

EXT MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY
Dastan and Tamina watch from a hill overlooking the town

TAMINA
(secretly relieved)
So much for finding a guide to
cross the desert

DASTAN
Yes
(pause)
We’ll have to get to take the
mountain route to Alamut instead

TAMINA
Impossible

DASTAN
Not impossible -- difficult

He stands and looks down at a checkpoint where soldiers are
monitoring the road

DASTAN (CONTD)
But first we need to get past that
checkpoint somehow

Intent on the problem they don’t notice the ARCHER above
drawing a bead on them until Tamina turns with a gasp

It’s a YOUNG SHEPHERD guarding his flock

Dastan makes a friendly “excuse us” gesture and hustles
Tamina along Fiercely scowling the SHEPHERD keeps the bow
and arrow trained on them as they pass

Seized by an afterthought Dastan turns back

TAMINA
What

CUT TO

EXT MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY
Now naked the Shepherd runs toward his hut shouting--

SHEPHERD
Papa Papa

Waving in his hand Dastan’s SILVER BRACELET

EXT CHECKPOINT - DAY

Tamina dressed as a shepherd rides the mule as Dastan leads
it Dastan has shed his princely armor and looks like any
common traveler They join the throng of people and animals
on the road

As they approach the checkpoint Tamina tenses up

DASTAN
Don’t worry I don’t look like a
prince of Nasaf any more than you
look like a girl

Tamina glowers but Dastan doesn’t notice They pass directly
in front of the soldiers unnoticed

EXT DESERT - DAY

The blazing sun beats down on the parched earth Groups of
travellers follow the road leading toward the wide open
desert

CAMERA LIFTS UP over a rise to REVEAL

Tracks in the sand lead to a pair of tiny figures who have
veered off heading toward the mountains Dastan and Tamina

EXT FOOTHILLS - LATER THAT DAY

Dastan leads the mule Tamina is slumped forward in the
saddle asleep He glances at her and smiles to himself

As soon as his back is turned Tamina opens one eye Without
lifting her head she very slowly raises her arm and reaches
out extending her fingers towards the DAGGER tucked into
Dastan’s waistband

The bounce in the mule’s gait brings her hand close closer
closer as her fingers begins to close around the hilt--

WHAM Dastan turns quick as a cat and grabs her wrist

DASTAN
You want this dagger pretty badly
don’t you

TAMINA
Let go of me

DASTAN
Not until you tell me why
Princess

She stares

TAMINA
You knew

He nods pleased with himself Her shock gives way to
outrage

TAMINA (CONTD)
You knew and yet you made me go on
playing the role of slave-girl
Doing your bidding--

DASTAN
(over her)
You are the one who has been lying

TAMINA
--cleaning your boots carrying the
firewood--

DASTAN
(sharply)
Let me see your hands

Confused Tamina shows him two empty hands Dastan deftly
ties them together

DASTAN (CONTD)
There Now we can continue

Over her protests he tosses her onto the mule’s back like
sack of potatoes

EXT ARMY CAMP - NIGHT

A FULL REGIMENT of the Persian army-- hundreds of horsemen

with a well-equipped supply train A SCOUT PATROL of half
dozen men rides through -- the YOUNG SHEPHERD is in their
custody

AT THE COMMAND TENT

NIZAM and GARSIV meet the SCOUT CHIEF He forces the YOUNG
SHEPHERD forward and hands Nizam Dastan’s bracelet

SCOUT CHIEF
This shepherd says he traded his
clothes and a mule for this
bracelet To aman and a woman

NIZAM
(recognizing the bracelet)
Dastan they slipped through the
checkpoint in disguise

GARSIV
Shall I give orders to pursue every
caravan that has set out for Alamut
across the desert in the past two
days

Nizam shakes his head and glances in the direction of the
mountains

NIZAM
No He has only one mule and no
guide he won’t take the desert
route He’ll try to cross the
mountains

Garsiv nods acknowledging Nizam’s acumen

a

GARSIV
(to his lieutenant)
Rouse the men We’re changing
course

ORDERS RING OUT down the line

The entire REGIMENT goes into motion

EXT MOUNTAINS - NEXT DAY

Again Dastan leads the mule Tamina sways in the saddle
tied in place by a turban cloth This time she really is
faint with exhaustion and thirst

The mule comes to a halt refusing to go further

DASTAN
Come on you beast move

The mule acts like a mule

TAMINA
Don’t blame the animal He’s not
the one who came up with this
suicidal plan
(off Dastan’s look)
He’s tired and hungry As am I
Untie us before we both expire

Dastan hesitates Tamina rolls her eyes

TAMINA (CONTD)
You have nothing to fear from me
Why would I attempt to take the
dagger again here in this god-
forsaken wilderness Where would I
go

DASTAN
(relents)
Out of pity for the mule

He frees her Tamina rubs her wrists where they were bound

TAMINA
What about food and water

DASTAN
God will provide

Dastan presses on Tamina and the mule follow

EXT HILLSIDE - LATER

Dastan and Tamina climb a steep little stream until a NOMAD
CAMP comes into view below A dozen tents mules and oxen
Hungrily Dastan sniffs the cooking aromas

DASTAN
I told you God will provide

He watches from behind a rock hiding

TAMINA
You mean to steal these peoples
food

DASTAN

They’re bandits It all evens out

TAMINA
Bandits

THEIR POV A few fierce-looking NOMAD MEN emerge They all
wear weapons Tamina doesn’t like the looks of this

DASTAN
Wait for me here

He dashes down the hill before she can stop him

EXT NOMAD CAMP - DAY

Dastan sneaks between the tents There are people around
but he manages to avoid being seen He ducks into a tent

INT NOMAD TENT - DAY

Dastan checks a few bowls and a copper pot -- all empty
Looking around he spots something hanging in a cloth sniffs
it Inside is a giant lump of dried buttermilk curd He
tastes it not bad Famished he shoves a big handful into
his mouth takes the rest to go

Startled by a MOO he turns to see a CALF watching him from a
dark corner of the tent

Dastan and the calf share a moment “Okay you caught me”
Then Dastan ducks out

And back inside in an instant as FEROCIOUSLY BARKING DOGS
descend on the tent Dastan hastily ties the entrance flap
shut The tent SHAKES as the dogs hurl themselves at it
EXT NOMAD TENT - DAY

NOMAD BANDITS alerted by the BARKING come to investigate
Dastan crawls out from under the other side of the tent
Spotting a CHICKEN strolling by Dastan snatches it and
dashes for the hill

EXT HILLSIDE - DAY

Tamina sees Dastan running up the hill toward her chased by
the pack of dogs

DASTAN
Run

Tamina hesitates turns to run And nearly smacks into
FAROOD

A grizzled gypsy in his fifties Two rough-looking BANDITS
behind him Utter incredulity on Farood’s face

Dastan arrives stops short on seeing their escape cut off
Turning to face the dogs he reaches for his sword--

FAROOD
Off

On command the dogs fall back snarling

Farood looks Dastan up and down Dastan releases the chicken
he’s holding

DASTAN
(re Tamina)
My cousin he’s hungry

FAROOD
A man should take care of his
family I have a family too A
big family

Farood indicates the camp below where a crowd of curious
NOMAD WOMEN and CHILDREN has gathered to watch Among them
is a GYPSY BOY who glares bravely at Dastan
DASTAN
Did not the Prophet say “Give
freely to those in need for what
you give God will replace”

FAROOD
A scholar

DASTAN
I’m only a poor student from
Samarkand My name is Ali
(before Tamina can speak)
And this is my cousin Bukbuk
Alas he’s mute

Tamina gapes in outrage

FAROOD
I am Farood These are my people
what is mine is theirs Ali of
Samarkand I will make you a
bargain give me that fine sword
you’re wearing and Ill give you
the chicken

DASTAN
A sword is worth more than a
chicken

FAROOD

A chicken is worth more to a hungry
thief than a sword to a dead one

DASTAN
The worth of a sword depends on
who’s wearing it To gain one
sword and one chicken at a cost of--
(surveys the opposition)
weight men Ten if I’m lucky is
hardly taking care of one’s family

Farood rubs his beard thoughtfully
FAROOD
You have a high opinion of your own
swordsmanship Ali of Samarkand
Shall we put it to the test

A GIANT BANDIT steps forward Seven feet tall

and grinning

evilly His friends place TWO SCIMITARS in his hands which
he brandishes in a blinding display of speed and skill

Dastan quickly recalculates the odds

DASTAN
Why risk damaging such fine weapons
when we could settle the matter
with a wager of skill
(dramatic pause)
wa throw of the knife

The bandits exchange dubious glances Dastan can sense it
will take something impressive to get them to agree

DASTAN (CONT ’D)
From twenty paces

Farood looks at him bemused

FAROOD
Twenty-five and you have a bet

Dastan takes his hand with a big grin no problem

CUT TO

EXT NOMAD CAMP - MINUTES LATER

Dastan crouches behind a tent hastily trying to fill the
DAGGER with SAND as he presses the jewel repeatedly It’s
not working

FAROOD (0S)
Ali We’re waiting

DASTAN
Just a minute

Tamina peers around the tent and sees what he’s up to
TAMINA
(whispers )

It won’t work with ordinary sand

Dastan looks up at her he gives up Taking a deep breath
he strides out into the circle of nomads where

A WOOD POST with an X has been set up A looong twenty-five
paces away a line in the sand marks Dastan’s throwing spot

Tamina looks at Dastan in dismay -- what has he gotten into
Dastan gives her a reassuring look

He flips the Dagger in his hand a few times gauging its
weight The hollow handle makes for an awkward balance

Dastan gets ready concentrating he catches the unnerving
stare of the little Gypsy Boy -- and loses his concentration
False start Everyone exhales

Dastan gives the kid a reproachful look “Don’t do that to
me” Gets ready again

And throws

Whop-whop-whop-whop PING The dagger hits the post
slightly off target-- and bounces off

Dastan turns to Farood hopefully

DASTAN
Two out of three

FAROOD
(beat)
Come We will speak man to man

Farood squires Dastan away Tamina faced with being left
alone with a dozen nomad bandits scurries after them

EXT NOMAD CAMP - DAY

Farood and Dastan pause at the edge of the camp Tamina
hovers ten feet away

FAROOD
May I ask after I take your sword
and send you on your way without a
chicken what is your plan

DASTAN
Without food or weapons I suppose
well die in a few days

FAROOD
(nods in agreement)
Your destination

DASTAN
Alamut To find a cure for the
curse that struck my cousin dumb

Dastan shoots a glance at Tamina who has no choice but to
play along She pretends to be oblivious Farood smiles at
her sympathetically then turns back to Dastan

FAROOD
It’s not often in this wilderness
that I meet a man as educated as
myself Though as you can see I
am virile as a bull -- alas my
wives have given me no sons Only
daughters Seven wives eleven
daughters

Dastan shakes his head with empathy

FAROOD (CONTD)
This is my great sorrow All I
have learned will die with me like
unpicked grapes that wither on the
vine-- for what good is education
to a woman

Tamina glares furiously at Dastan as he nods in agreement

FAROOD (CONTD)
A man of business needs a protogé--
a partner Where will I find such
a man among this bunch of louts
(waves toward the bandits)
One might as easily teach a goat to
speak

DASTAN
Your daughters are unmarried

FAROOD
They are like eleven moons each
more beautiful than the next I
have yet to find the man worthy of
them

Dastan looks back toward camp thinking

FAROOD (CONTD)
We travel the same road Tonight
we will cook the chicken you did
not win My gift to you and your
poor cousin Did not the Prophet
say it is a duty to give
hospitality to those in need

Farood strides off leaving Dastan behind Tamina comes up
to him

TAMINA
(mocking)
‘What good is education to a
women ‘
(disgusted)
You can’t seriously mean for us to
travel with that man

DASTAN
Why not

TAMINA
He’s uncivilized rude filthy
backward--

DASTAN

Shh You’re mute

Left alone to simmer Tamina notices a female nomad (HALEEMA)
gazing at her Haleema built like a house smiles
coquettishly Tamina scowls and looks away Haleema’s smile
broadens she’s in love

EXT MOUNTAINS - DAY

The NOMAD CARAVAN wends its way along a mountain path pack
animals carrying the rolled up tents and mats

Tamina watches Dastan up ahead showing off by doing
handsprings between two mules The nomads including the
little boy laugh and applaud Dastan falls back to rejoin
Tamina

TAMINA
How nice You’ve found friends on
your own level

DASTAN
At least gypsies know how to have
fun

TAMINA

I’m talking about the mules

She rides off

Dastan hears muffled laughter and turns to see several gypsy
WOMEN riding up on camels Exotically beautiful they giggle
and whisper behind their veils

ON FAROOD
Dastan comes up beside him

DASTAN
You chose your words well A moon
shines at night but even daylight
cannot veil its beauty
(off Farood’s confusion)
Your daughters

FAROOD
(sees where Dastan looks)
Oh those aren’t my daughters I
wouldn’t let them dress like that
Those are my daughters

Dastan follows his gesture to see
FAROOD’S ELEVEN DAUGHTERS

Riding in a wagon Strong as men and twice as homely they
glare at Dastan (Haleema among them)

FAROOD (CONTD)
I’ve brought them up properly
Hard workers-- and every one a
virgin

Dastan stares Any one of them could break him in two

FAROOD (CONTD)
As my partner you could become a
rich man very quickly Perhaps you
could afford to marry all my
daughters

Dastan smiles queasily

FAROOD (CONTD)
Do you wish to know the secret of
my success War
(confidentially)
Alamut has fallen to a foreign
army A great piece of luck-- for
us War is hard on soldiers and
common people But for men of
vision war is an opportunity
(MORE )

FAROOD (CONTD)
Salt cloth things nobody thinks
twice of in times of peace--
overnight the price goes up
tenfold This is why Farood will
take his tribe to Alamut

(a wink re his daughters)

Think about my offer

Beaming he claps Dastan on the back and rides off

Dastan looks back at the daughters as they pass

TAMINA

Haleema offers her a water flask Tamina shakes her head
attempting to simultaneously convey masculinity lack of
interest and muteness Haleema insists Tamina gives in and
drinks from the flask

Farood’s other ten daughters hoot with delight startling
Tamina into a coughing fit Haleema beams adoringly
Apparently sharing water is a significant nomad courtship

As Tamina rides past Dastan winks at her

DASTAN
I see you’ve found a friend too

EXT MOUNTAINS - EVENING
The caravan is camped for the night

Dastan uses the DAGGER to play mumbletypeg with the GYPSY
BOY He pauses hearing a distant noise The noise grows
into a THUNDER Everybody stands to look as

A CAVALRY REGIMENT charges past on the road above Dastan
pulls Tamina aside

DASTAN
Soldiers of Nasaf

TAMINA
It sounds like they sent the entire
army after you

The last of the horsemen disappear into the distance
DASTAN

They won’t find us tonight at
least

They settle down to prepare for sleep As Dastan removes his
boots he notices Tamina staring at him

The firelight bathes her skin in a warm glow Dastan stares
back captivated by her beauty a smile spreading over his
face until--

He realizes she’s not staring at him she’s staring at the
DAGGER in his belt

His smile vanishes Dastan marches over and without a word
binds her hands together with a length of rope

TAMINA
(protesting)
What I didn’t do anything

DASTAN
Your eyes give you away Princess

Dastan ties the other end of the rope to a nearby tree He
knots it firmly then turns to see

The Gypsy Boy staring at him

DASTAN (CONTD)
(stammers )
My cousin he is afflicted not
only with muteness but also
sleepwalking If I don’t tie him
to a tree at night he might wander
off and hurt himself

The Gypsy Boy doesn’t move Dastan puts an arm around the
boy’s shoulder

DASTAN (CONTD)
If my cousin should try to get free
while I’m asleep-- wake me

Dastan glances once more at Tamina The murderous look on
her face makes him glad she’s tied up

Dastan makes a show of rolling the DAGGER inside his cloak
which he then puts under his head as a pillow He waves good
night to Tamina she’s not getting the dagger She glares
back at him and turns the other way

The Gypsy Boy watches the proceedings with large curious
eyes

Dastan promptly falls asleep

DISSOLVE TO

EXT MOUNTAINS - NEXT MORNING
Dastan is awakened by sunlight in his eyes He’s overslept

He sits up feels his cloak with the reassuring LUMP of the
DAGGER inside

DASTAN
(turns toward Tamina)
Time to get up--

And freezes Tamina is gone He scrambles over and finds
the frayed end of the rope

His face fills with dread as he returns to his cloak and
hurriedly unwraps the bundle

THE DAGGER IS GONE In its place is a stick about the same
size Dastan’s face darkens with rage

EXT CARAVAN -— MOMENTS LATER

Haleema serves a bowl of warm goat’s milk to Tamina who is
already feasting on a hearty breakfast Haleema urges her to
drink up as she goes off to get more food for her

DASTAN
Strides up and yanks Tamina rudely away
DASTAN
Ha Not much of an escape when you
stop for breakfast
TAMINA
I didn’t escape Haleema came

along and “freed” me this morning

Tamina holds up the broken rope and pantomimes biting through
it

DASTAN
Hand it over

She looks at him blankly Dastan sighs then starts to pat
her down She slaps his hands away

TAMINA
What do you think you’re doing

DASTAN
The dagger Where is it

A look of horror on her face Dastan realizes
doesn’t have it A beat

FAROOD (0S)
Ali Bukbuk Why didn’t you say
you wanted to come to the market

They turn and find Farood grinning broadly

FAROOD (CONTD)
Come Whatever you are here to
buy I will help you From Bukhara
to Baghdad nobody drives a harder
bargain than Farood

Dastan smiles weakly

DASTAN
Thank you Farood but that won’t be
necessary We have only one small
thing to buy it’s nothing really

FAROOD
Then we shall get it for nothing

Farood throws an arm around each of them and drags them out
from behind the stall

Dastan and Tamina unable to resist do their best to keep
their faces concealed

FAROOD (CONTD)
This is an excellent chance for you
to begin your apprenticeship Ali
Have you thought about my proposal

Tamina glances at Dastan questioningly
DASTAN

Ah yes your beautiful daughters
I can’t get them out of my head

INT INN - LATER

An older female DANCER gyrates listlessly to the music played
on drums tambourines and flutes The tables are crowded
with diverse travelers

Farood Dastan and Tamina enter and make their way to

INT BACK ROOM - SAME

LENK the wizened Mongolian innkeeper makes notes in his
ledger Behind him is a middle-eastern pawn shop The
DAGGER sits prominently on a shelf

Dastan disentangles himself from Farood and gestures for him
and Tamina to stay put

Dastan approaches the Innkeeper

DASTAN
Salaam Aleikum I’m told you are
not only an innkeeper but a trader
of great renown

Lenk looks up slowly Takes him in

LENK
You have some worthless thing you
want to sell

DASTAN
Actually to buy A mere trinket
A small dagger of purely
sentimental value that I believe
you ah there it is

He points Lenk picks up the dagger and examines it

LENK
A trinket This dagger has a gold
hilt encrusted with rubies and
sapphires The edge is sharp
enough to split hairs And the
workmanship is so fine it looks as
if it were made by the gods

DASTAN
(feigns disinterest)
I’ve seen better how much do you
want for it

LENK
One hundred dinars

DASTAN
Done

Quick as a flash Dastan slaps the coin purse on the table
Lenk picks up the purse with surprise
Farood jumps forward and grabs it back
FAROOD
No no no That’s no way to
bargain

(to Lenk)
Twenty dinars

LENK
The price has already been agreed
DASTAN
It’s true the price has been
agreed
FAROOD
Nobody pays the first price
offered
(to Lenk)

He is a beginner Fifty dinars

LENK
One hundred dinars

FAROOD
You are thief not an innkeeper
Come were leaving

Farood grabs Dastan and hustles him out
OUTSIDE THE BACK ROOM
Dastan stops Farood
DASTAN
Farood you don’t understand I
want that dagger
FAROOD
Oh he’ll come running after us and

take the fifty dinars wait and
see
Dastan whisks the purse from Farood and heads

FAROOD (CONTD)
No he must come to us
(shakes his head)
It’s going to take some time to
teach him

INT BACK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Dastan hurries to the desk

DASTAN
I accept One hundred dinars

back

He puts the money in front of Lenk who offended doesn’t

look up from his writing

LENK
No deal

DASTAN
All right then name your price

LENK
There is no price Am I a beggar
to take insults from a gypsy

Dastan is at a loss Now he’s completely screwed

TAMINA (0S)
Suppose I ask you

Lenk’s pen freezes at the sound of the sweet
He looks up to see where it came from

Tamina steps forward and removes her turban
her long dark hair A beat Lenk grins

LENK
For you the price is one hundred
dinars and one dance for my
guests

DASTAN
(instantly)
Done

Tamina looks at him in shock and betrayal

feminine voice

Shakes loose

INT INN BACK STAGE - NIGHT
Dastan hovers outside a curtained doorway

DASTAN
(guiltily)
It must feel good to get out of
those rags

TAMINA (VO)
(coldly from within)
Go away

INT INN - NIGHT

Dastan pulls up an ottoman behind Farood’s Farood glances
at the dagger in Dastan’s belt

FAROOD
I don’t mean to be critical Ali
but you got the worst of that
bargain

DASTAN
(his eyes on the stage)
Maybe not the absolute worst

Just then the musicians strike up a rousing dance rhythm
The customers lift their heads expectantly

The musicians continue and continue Still the stage
remains empty The BAND LEADER beckons furiously toward
backstage gives the crowd a phony smile

At that moment the front door opens Dastan turns to see
GARSIV and SIX SOLDIERS enter with a blast of cold air from
outside The soldiers take several tables displacing the

locals

Dastan turns pale He pushes his chair back into the shadows

behind a pillar so that he is concealed from Garsiv’s view
Farood notes Dastan’s reaction realizing something is up

ON STAGE

Tamina edges into view She wears a veil and holds a scarf
in each hand as is traditional in Mongolian yak-herding
regions She looks as if she wants to sink into the floor
Someone backstage SHOVES her on -- she reacts angrily

DASTAN

winces The crowd is starting to mutter He glances
nervously to see if Garsiv has noticed

GARSIV

Far from suspicious Garsiv seems perversely amused by the
spectacle onstage He turns to his LIEUTENANT

GARSIV
Pretty girl A pity she can’t
dance

DASTAN
Hiding behind the pillar frantically gestures to Tamina to
“dance” She glares back at him He demonstrates showing
her how she needs to move her hips then sees Farood looking
at him
DASTAN
(“grooving”)
The music is good isn’t it

TAMINA

Ventures a timid dance step The crowd BOOS Someone throws
a chicken bone at the stage

Dastan makes more emphatic “dance” gestures for Tamina behind
Farood’s back indicating the soldiers with his eyes

Tamina looks Registers Garsiv’s presence

Tamina’s expression changes Glaring defiantly at Dastan
she shakes her booty in the manner he advised The crowd
HOOTS and applauds The band leader relieved kicks the
music up a notch

Tamina dances with plenty of hip gyrations and scarf-
twirling Her eyes glint with cunning

Garsiv is riveted

Dastan watches nervously as

Tamina dances off the stage cutting a swath through the
room straight toward Dastan All the time she keeps one eye
on the soldiers Alarmed Dastan ducks under the table
baffling Farood

DASTAN (CONTD)
I think I dropped some

Tamina pulls Dastan to his feet His back is to Garsiv and
the soldiers so they can’t see his face

Tamina dances seductively around him Her hands caress his
body without actually touching Her breath sears his cheek
through the veil

THE NOMADS AND YAK HERDERS
Stare open-mouthed They’ve never seen anything like this
The gypsy boy his sight blocked by grown-ups strains for a

better view

GARSIV speaks to his lieutenant without taking his eyes off
Tamina

GARSIV
Whatever that girl costs -- pay it

TAMINA and DASTAN

She’s outdoing herself putting on an erotic floor show that
has riveted the whole room

DASTAN
(hisses)
That’s enough

Tamina keeps it up smiling wickedly she draws a gossamer
scarf across Dastan’s face He’s sweating bullets

Before he’s quite realized what’s happening she’s drawn the
DAGGER from his belt-- wrapping it in several turns of her
scarf-- and is dancing away

Outraged Dastan starts to go after her-- then stops If he
pursues her Garsiv will surely see him He steps back into
the shadow of the pillar out of sight

Tamina dances back to the stage having gotten what she
wanted But as she passes the table of soldiers

Her eyes briefly meet Garsiv’s through the veil Is that
lust or recognition in his stare

Unnerved Tamina hurries onto the stage With a final
flourish of scarves she disappears through the curtain

The room ERUPTS They’1ll be talking about this for months
DASTAN

Glowering jumps to his feet He makes a beeline for the
stage but his way is blocked by the crowd of Tamina’s
admirers Lenk patiently handles the crush of MERCHANTS and
TRADERS thrusting coin purses at him

Dastan glances back across the room to the table where Garsiv
was sitting It’s empty

EXT BAZAAR - NIGHT

Tamina hurries down alleys glancing over her shoulder
Mongolian MEN loitering in groups in the darkness notice

DASTAN
Climbs onto a rooftop Up a series of ladders drainpipes
and awnings until he has a vantage point of the surrounding

streets and alleys

Nimble as a cat he runs and jumps from one rooftop to the
next scanning all the while for a sign of

TAMINA

Rounds a corner and spots an unattended pony She goes over
to untie the animal She hears a footstep and turns

GARSIV

steps into the light His soldiers fan out in a semi-circle
cutting off her escape

GARSIV
A magnificent dancer and a horse
thief You have so many talents

Tamina hides the dagger inside her robe

TAMINA
I will pay for the horse

GARSIV
Yes you will And for helping the
assassin Dastan escape Slave-Girl

Tamina puts on a brave face but she knows the game is up
Garsiv has recognized her The soldiers seize her roughly

ANGLE ON DASTAN

Watching from a rooftop He follows and watches them take
her away to

EXT GRAND HOUSE - NIGHT
SOLDIERS sweep through the gate on horseback
Garsiv dismounts and approaches one of the guards

GARSIV
Send for Nizam He’1ll want to be
woken for this

EXT CARAVAN - NIGHT

Dastan paces back and forth gripping his sword and muttering
to himself He draws a line in the dirt and starts making
hash marks on either side to weigh pros and cons

DASTAN
(on the con side)
«the place is well-guarded and
youd probably get yourself killed
(in the pro column)
she has that magic daggev
(con)
only because she stole it from you
at the Inn
(pro)
wL£ you don’t rescue her Garsiv
will do with her as he pleases

That really burns him up
Farood comes up behind him

FAROOD
If you are finished drawing in the
dirt Ali of Samarkand we are
preparing to go
(a beat)
Where is your cousin

Dastan turns

DASTAN
That is a long story

FAROOD
Is it a good story

Farood takes a seat on a rock and makes himself comfortable
Dastan sighs he’s going to have to tell him something

DASTAN
I have a confession to make Farood
Bukbuk is not my cousin Bukbuk is
my fiancée You see--

Farood holds up a hand

FAROOD
I make no judgements

DASTAN
Bukbuk was the dancing girl I
mean the dancing girl was Bukbuk

FAROOD
(confused)
What Oh you mean Ahhh

Farood grins broadly and slaps Dastan on the shoulder Dastan
nods and starts lying quickly

DASTAN
Our parents forbid the marriage so
we fled Her father had us
declared outlaws and sent the
soldiers after us We escaped by
disguising ourselves Now after
all we’ve been through she has
been captured

Dastan hangs his head
FAROOD
That is a good story Ali Tragic

but with a romantic flavor

DASTAN
Will you help me rescue her

Farood stands and dusts off his hands

FAROOD
Farood may share a chicken with a
hungry thief but he does not risk
his neck for an amusing story

DASTAN
What about a trade

Farood turns and sees that Dastan is holding out something
shiny a gold ring Farood hesitates then takes the ring
and inspects it
FAROOD
Youre either a very rich student
Ali or a very good thief

CUT TO

INT GRAND HOUSE UPSTAIRS CHAMBER - NIGHT

Tamina is fighting like a wild animal restrained by TWO
LARGE SOLDIERS struggling to hold her by the arms

Garsiv is in front of her

GARSIV
Tell us where Dastan is

TAMINA
Fool I fled alone Isn’t that
evidence enough that his
whereabouts are not my concern

GARSIV
You will talk

She writhes in their grasp and kicks her legs Then
NIZAM (0S)
(a stern voice)

Let her go

The soldiers instantly obey Nizam steps forward having
entered the room unseen Garsiv and the others step back

Nizam walks up to Tamina

NIZAM (CONTD)
Are you hurt child

Tamina catches her breath and shakes her head He looks at
her carefully

NIZAM (CONTD)
What a beautiful face I see
nobility in your features and in
your eyes

He runs a finger over her cheekbone

NIZAM (CONTD)
And your accent betrays a Palace
education The King of Alamut had a
daughter

Tamina tries not to react as Nizam runs his finger down her
throat to the clasp of her robe

NIZAM (CONTD)
Underneath this common disguise I
suspect we’d find a royal treasure

With sudden violence he rips open her outer robe revealing
the DAGGER tucked into her inner garment

A beat Tamina makes a move to reach for it-- Garsiv and
both soldiers have their swords at her throat in no time

She freezes as Nizam gently lifts the DAGGER from its place
He gazes at it like a long lost child

NIZAM (CONTD)
Twenty-five years that’s how long
I’ve searched for this

TAMINA
That dagger is sacred By all that
is Holy I command you--

NIZAM
Command Your days of commanding
are over Princess

Garsiv is completely puzzled
GARSIV

My Lord I don’t understand what
is that dagger

NIZAM
It is the key to a treasure of
unimaginable value Garsiv A
treasure we will find in Alamut

He bows slightly to Tamina and heads for the door

NIZAM (CONTD)
At first light we leave for
Alamut We can take the desert
route now It will be faster

GARSIV
But what about Prince Dastan

NIZAM
He no longer matters
(to Tamina)
You on the other hand will come
with us You are going to guide me
to the Hourglass

She shoots him a look of pure hatred

TAMINA
Never

Nizam only smiles then exits Garsiv steps forward and
whispers in her ear

GARSIV
Dastan may no longer matter to
Nizam but he matters to me

He nods to the soldiers who pin her arms and bind her wrists
together Garsiv still breathing down her neck knots a
LENGTH of ROPE to her bound wrists

GARSIV (CONTD)
First light is still hours away

He throws the other end of the rope over a rafter and pulls
it tight until her arms are stretched up over her head

GARSIV (CONTD)
You’11 tell me where he is before
dawn I promise you

He gives the rope an extra tug and ties it to a cleat on the
wall He leaves her alone standing painfully on her toes

EXT GRAND HOUSE - NIGHT
A pair of SOLDIERS guard the gate surrounding the compound
Farood approaches a bottle in hand weaving slightly

FAROOD
Salaam aliekum

As he bows to the soldiers a pair of dice falls out of his
sleeve and rolls up to their feet their eyes meet

CUT TO
A FEW MINUTES LATER
As Farood plays dice and drinks with the guards

Dastan scales the wall in the background He scampers over
and jumps to

A LARGE WALNUT TREE

Dastan climbs up and out a limb toward the house

INT GRAND HOUSE UPSTAIRS CHAMBER - SAME

Tamina is tied up where Garsiv left her She rubs and twists
her wrists together in a desperate effort to fray the rope
It’s no use

Suddenly a movement outside the window catches her eye She
turns and sees

DASTAN
perched on a tree limb as far out as he can go

Tamina’s eyes light up with astonishment and hope She can’t
believe he’s here

He puts his finger to his lips-- points down
REVEAL MORE SOLDIERS

Keeping watch around the house Dastan assesses the
situation fifteen feet to the window-- too far to jump

ON TAMINA - she hears footsteps outside the door

She makes an impatient face at Dastan “Get me out of here”
He holds up a finger “Give me a second I’m thinking”
Dastan stares through the open window at her bound wrists
Gets an idea He takes out a knife and starts flipping it in
his hand Looks at Tamina

DASTAN

(mouths silently)
DON’T MOVE

Tamina sees what he’s planning

TAMINA
(mouths back)
NO
He nods reassuringly “I can do this”

She shakes her head emphatically “No you can’t”

Ignoring her Dastan braces himself and takes aim She
shakes her head furiously NO

Dastan cocks the knife one two three

Just as he releases a HISSING sound distracts Dastan A
LARGE SNAKE is coiling itself around the branch by his feet

Dastan jerks
The knife flies through the window
Tamina closes her eyes as the knife sails past and

THWACK It slices through the rope where it’s tied to the
wall causing it to go slack

Tamina opens her eyes in amazement and realizes her arms are
no longer held up She yanks the rope from the rafter and
runs to the window She sees Dastan doing a curious dance on
the tree branch

TAMINA (CONTD)
(whispers loudly)
Stop fooling around and catch this
rope

Dastan looks up as Tamina throws the rope The snake
strikes Dastan jumps Catches the rope in mid-aiv

Tamina is yanked OUT the window by her bound wrists They
plummet toward the ground until the rope catches on a lower
branch they bounce to a halt ten feet above the ground

They swing back and forth for a moment

TAMINA (CONTD)
(hissed whisper)
You know for a minute I thought
you were actually going to try to
cut my hands free with that knife
throw

Dastan laughs nervously Her eyes narrow that’s exactly
what he was trying to do

TAMINA (CONTD)
You--—

CRACK The branch breaks sending them crashing to the
ground

TWO SOLDIERS come running

SOLDIERS
Who goes there

Dastan and Tamina pull the rope taught into a tripline and
sweep the onrushing guards off their feet even as she
continues to vent her fury

TAMINA
I can’t believe you The only
reason you didn’t kill me is that
you’re such a bad shot you didn’t
come close

Dastan RAPS the soldiers’ heads together before they can get
up

DASTAN
Is that your way of saying “thank
you for rescuing me”

Tamina takes off running toward the house then runs out of
rope and comes crashing to the ground

DASTAN (CONTD)
Wrong way

TAMINA
The dagger is this way

Two more GUARDS emerge from the house and start toward them

DASTAN
Escape is this way

Dastan pulls her back to him and cuts her free He takes her
by the hand and sets off running away from the house
INT GRAND HOUSE - NIGHT
Garsiv arrives at the door to the chamber where he left
Tamina an unpleasant grin on his face Garsiv opens the
door expecting to see her hanging there ready to plead for
mercy only to find
She’s gone

EXT GRAND HOUSE - NIGHT

Farood waits nervously with two camels There’s a rustling
in the tree branches above and

Dastan drops down beside him He reaches up to help Tamina
who ignores him and jumps down on her own

Farood looks her over
FAROOD

I like you better as a woman

Bukbuk One thing I don’t

understand are you still a mute
Before she can respond they HEAR SHOUTS of ALARM raised
within Farood hands them both full length BURKHAS They
throw them on and mount the camels

Farood sets off with his two “WOMEN” behind him

EXT MOUNTAINS - DAWN
The nomad caravan is waking up
TAMINA and DASTAN take off their disguises

He gives her the shepherd outfit and dutifully faces away
from her while she changes into it

TAMINA
Perhaps I have been wrong about
you

DASTAN
How so

TAMINA
You risked your life to come back
for me

DASTAN
(gruff)
I only came to get you because you
had the dagger Otherwise--
She steps in front of him and puts her finger to his lips

TAMINA
I’m trying to say “thank you”

She kisses him lightly

Dastan is dumbstruck uncertain how to respond She smiles
and walks away

DASTAN
(after her)
You’re welcome

EXT MOUNTAINSIDE - MOMENTS LATER

Tamina stands at an overlook The regiment of Nasaf soldiers
rides out into the valley below departing for Alamut across
the desert route

TAMINA
They were never after you Nizam
was only interested in the dagger

DASTAN
My uncle

ON DASTAN as this sinks in

DASTAN (CONTD)
I see now

INSERT FLASH MEMORY - Nizam holds up the documents he “found”
on the smugglers He points to Alamut on the map

DASTAN (VO) (CONTD)
It was Nizam who tricked us into
invading your kingdom with false
documents

INSERT FLASH MEMORY - Nizam examines the dagger as he rides
alongside Dastan on the road home from Alamut

DASTAN (VO) (CONTD)
He saw that I had the dagger

FLASH MEMORY - Nizam watches Shahraman put on the poisoned
robe

DASTAN (VO) (CONTD)
He poisoned the robe and framed me
for my father’s murder All to get
the dagger

RESUME SCENE

Dastan’s fists are clenched in fury Tamina puts a hand
gently on his arm

TAMINA
The dagger is a powerful weapon
But it can only be refilled at the
Sands of Time which are hidden in
Alamut

DASTAN
Then we must stop Nizam before he
gets to them

Tamina nods

TAMINA
We need to get the dagger back and
take it far away to a safe place

Dastan looks over at her suddenly

DASTAN
We need to get the dagger back
After that we’ll let my brother
the King decide what to do with
it

TAMINA
(indignant)
It doesn’t belong to you It’s the
sacred possession of my kingdom

Dastan holds up a hand

DASTAN
Let’s concentrate on stopping Nizam
for now Can we agree on that

She stares at him warily A beat Then she relents with a
nod Deal For the time being

INT TREASURE VAULT - DAY

A marble chamber eight-foot by eight-foot square Walls as
smooth as glass rise to SLIT WINDOWS forty-feet above

The only entry point is a two-foot thick STONE DOOR with a
massive iron lock It’s so heavy it takes all the strength
of two enormous soldiers to scrape it open

Nizam enters with Garsiv

NIZAM
Keep your most trusted guards on
the door

Nizam places the DAGGER into a glass CASE in the center of
the room

NIZAM (CONTD)
The people of Alamut cannot know
that I have this dagger It isa
sacred relic to them -- they would
overrun the Palace if they found
out

GARSIV
The dagger and the secret are safe
here

TRACK with them as they exit

The two behemoth SOLDIERS strain every muscle to push the
door shut behind them

Nizam turns the KEY and puts it back onto the chain around

You will make an excellent General
of the Armies when all this is
finished Garsiv

GARSIV
Thank you my lord

EXT GATES OF ALAMUT - DAY

Occupied by the Persian army the citadel of Alamut stands
exposed in broad daylight and shorn of its mystery

Soldiers stationed at the entrance do a thorough job of
checking everyone who goes in or out Farood and his nomads
wait on the bridge for their turn

FAROOD
We who have crossed the Hindu Kush
and endured every hardship of God’s
creation-- now we wait

Dastan and Tamina exchange a nervous glance getting into the
city could be the toughest part of all

DASTAN
Farood there’s something more I
have to tell you I’m not really--

FAROOD
Nonsense You have nothing to tell
me Ali my friend I have been
thinking of the tale of Layla and
Majnun -- the young scholar who
abducted his beloved from her
husband’s home

DASTAN
(perplexed)
He did not abduct her Mayjnun
spent his life pining for Layla and
died a wanderer in the desert

FAROOD
Ah well you are more educated than
I In the version I heard they
escaped together -- under the noses
of her husbands men

DASTAN
How did they do that

FAROOD
His friends created a disturbance
while the lovers slipped through
the gates

Dastan glances at the checkpoint Their turn is coming up

FAROOD (CONTD)
Ali I am not a man to pry into
matters that do not concern me
But I advise you to consider my
version of the story

(into Dastan’s ear)
Anyway do you really think I would
let my daughters marry such a man--
a womanizer with no respect for the
law

Before Dastan can reply Farood hurries to intercept a
Soldier who is just lifting the tarp covering the wagon

FAROOD (CONTD)

Ah ha Please You may search me
and every member of my tribe-- but
to search that wagon is a waste of
time

SOLDIER
Stand back

The soldiers restrain Farood who becomes agitated

FAROOD
Why do you not search the camels
and the mules Why this absurd
fascination with that cart Take
your hands off me

All the soldiers come rushing over to contain the situation
Dastan nudges Tamina They edge around the commotion while
Farood continues to struggle and make a fuss

The soldiers slash at the tarp and rip it from the cart
CHICKENS FLY OUT into their faces The nomads race to catch
the escaping poultry

FAROOD (CONTD)

Now who will compensate me for my
chickens In God’s name tie the
cloth before they all escape

Dastan sees the gypsy boy watching him He winks and waves
good-bye and slips through the gate with Tamina

EXT COURTYARD - DAY

A MASSIVE EXCAVATION PROJECT is under way in the main
courtyard HUNDREDS of SLAVES overseen by soldiers dig a pit
at the entrance of the temple where the SACRED FOUNTAIN lies
shattered into pieces

TUS and NIZAM survey the excavation from a battlement

TUS
We should be home in Nasaf This
search has cost us too many lives
already and we’ve found nothing

NIZAM
That is why we must press on we do
not want our soldiers’ blood to
have been shed in vain The
armories are here Why else would
these people build such defenses
and resist so fiercely if not to
hide some great secret Only be
patient my King

ANGLE ON TAMINA and DASTAN

Hiding behind a low wall Tamina removes the turban and ties
her hair in the more feminine local fashion

Dastan peers over the edge and spots Tus

DASTAN
My brother

His face darkens as he sees Nizam whispering in Tus’s ear

DASTAN (CONTD)
Nizam has already poisoned him
against me

Tamina peers over and despairs at the devastation

TAMINA
They’ve defiled the temple and
destroyed the sacred fountain At
this rate they could reach the
Hourglass by tomorrow

DASTAN
The Hourglass

TAMINA
(hesitates)
Come It’s time you knew what lies
beneath the temple

INT DOORWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Tamina pulls him into the shadows and speaks in a hushed
otherworldly voice

TAMINA
‘The sun god looked down and saw
the wickedness of man and it
angered him He sent a great sand
storm to destroy every living thing
and wipe clean the face of the
earth’

Dastan shivers spooked by her trancelike recitation

TAMINA (CONTD)
‘But the Great Mother said to the
sun god “Who are you to destroy
my creation” And she blew the
sands into an Hourglass so strong
no sword nor spear could break it
And thus she spoke “These are the
Sands of Time As you decreed all
that lives shall die-- but not at
once Rather day by day hour by
hour as the sand flows through the
hourglass so shall life slip away
from all my children until it is
empty”’

Her words die into reverential silence-- which Dastan breaks

DASTAN
First of all there is only one
God Second the way I heard it
it was a flood not a sand storm

She gives him a withering look

TAMINA
For ten thousand years the
Hourglass holding the Sands of Time
has rested here in Alamut below
the temple The dagger is the key
the only blade that can penetrate
the glass Do you understand

Dastan absorbs this a thought is forming in his head

DASTAN
How does it work Is there a limit
to how far back you can rewind
time

TAMINA
It is forbidden to use more than a
minute of sand

DASTAN
But could it be done Could Nizam
go back years for example

TAMINA
(fearful)
Why do you ask

DASTAN
When Nizam and my father were mere
boys they used to go hunting
together just the two of them My
father often told a story about the
time he fell before a wild boar--
and how Nizam saved his life If
Nizam could go back in time and not
save my father

TAMINA
then he would become king

DASTAN
Exactly I’ve been trying to
figure out why Nizam would risk
everything for the dagger After
all he already has wealth and
power But a chance to start life
over again and live as King if
that were possible

Tamina looks at him gravely
TAMINA
It is With the dagger and the
Hourglass Nizam will control time
itself

HOLD ON DASTAN as the consequences sink in

EXT ALAMUT - LATE AFTERNOON

A muezzin gives the “call to prayer” from a towering minaret
rising above the citadel

A TIME LAPSE SHOT accelerates the sun’s passage across the
sky REVEALING that the SPIRE casts a shadow across a GIANT
SUN DIAL hewn into the ancient courtyard

A LOCAL SERVING GIRL scurries down an alleyway to find
TAMINA and DASTAN
In the shadows The SERVING GIRL whispers to Tamina in

Foreign After delivering her message she bows deeply and
kisses Tamina’s hand before departing

DASTAN
Okay so you really are the
Princess

TAMINA

I know where the dagger is

Tamina leads Dastan through a twisting maze of narrow stone
passageways and back alleys

DASTAN
How

TAMINA
The women of Alamut scrub the
floors and cook the food for your
army They hear everything And
they are fiercely loyal to me

They press into a doorway while a troop of Nasaf soldiers
marches by

TAMINA (CONTD)
Nizam has occupied the Red Palace
When he arrived Nizam placed
something inside the treasure
vault It is secured with a single
door of solid stone and they say
Nizam wears the key around his neck
at all times As an added
precaution he has ordered two
dozen soldiers to guard the
entrance day and night

They emerge into the sunlight and look up at
THE RED PALACE

an imposing stone fortress of towers and battlements The
stone has a pinkish cast

TAMINA (CONTD)
It was built in ancient times by
master stone-cutters so skilled
that the bricks need no mortar to
hold them together The walls are
three-feet thick and the gates are
fortified

Dastan stares in silence She glances at him and does a
double-take From his vacant stare she’s worried that he’s
overwhelmed by the challenge

In fact he’s thinking an idea forming in his mind

DASTAN
No mortar
(turns to her)
Can your subjects get us inside of
there Princess

TAMINA
(hesitates)
I can think of one way it might be
possible but you won’t like it

OFF HIS REACTION
CUT TO

INT RED PALACE HALLWAY - NIGHT

An ALAMUT MATRON leads a group of half a dozen VEILED GIRLS
down the hallway One of them is noticeably taller and
broader than the others REVEAL

DASTAN disguised as a girl (and looking none-too-pleased
about it) He whispers to Tamina

DASTAN
When you suggested sneaking in
through the Harem I imagined it
was going to be a lot more fun

TAMINA
The Harem Room is located in the
heart of the Palace It was the
only way to get close to the rear
wall of the treasure vault

INT PALACE HALLWAY - SAME
Garsiv and Nizam walk down the corridor

NIZAM
The King grows impatient Tomorrow
I want the number of slaves working
doubled

GARSIV
We are already using all the slaves
we have my Lord

NIZAM
Then they will work double shifts

NIZAM looks up and sees
THE MATRON and the VEILED “GIRLS”

Coming down the hallway from the opposite direction He
holds up his hand

NIZAM (CONTD)
What is this

ALAMUT MATRON
(bowing)
New virgins for the Harem my Lord

Nizam walks suspiciously down the line inspecting the girls
one by one Their faces are completely hidden except for the
eyes

As Nizam approaches Dastan shrinks behind his veil and looks
down

DASTAN’S POV - Nizam’s feet stop right in front of him
NIZAM (0S)
This one has an uncommonly pretty

figure Long limbs narrow waist

INSERT Dastan’s eyes go wide His fingers curl around the
hilt of his sword beneath his disguise

NIZAM (0S) (CONT’D)
She shall serve us tonight

Dastan looks up and sees that

Nizam is talking about Tamina who is right beside him He
and Garsiv sweep off down the hall

Tamina and Dastan exchange a panicked glance Tamina shoves
a FOLDED DIAGRAM into his hand as she’s pulled away

TAMINA
(whispers )
Don’t wait for me Find the
dagger

INT HAREM ROOM - NIGHT

Satin cushions delicacies from the orient beautiful women
veiled in gossamer and silk

Dastan enters with the Alamut Matron He stops and stares
for a moment grinning The girls don’t even notice him--
he’s completely forgotten that he’s disguised as a woman

The Alamut Matron tugs at his sleeve

ALAMUT MATRON
This way Hurry

Dastan snaps out of it He quickly strips off his disguise
in preparation for the next step of his mission Now he gets
plenty of looks from the girls

No time to stay and enjoy the attention He follows the
Matron to a side door

INT CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Dastan hurries down the corridor alone consulting the
DIAGRAM Tamina has given him

He stops at an ORNATE FOUNTAIN depicted on the drawing He
orients himself then starts carefully counting out paces

He arrives at the “spot” marked on the diagram He kneels by
the wall unslinging a sack from around his shoulders He
selects a particular one of the STONE BLOCKS in the wall
(each about 18 inches square)

He takes out a THREADED METAL BOLT and a MALLET and prepares
to hammer the bolt into the center of the BLOCK

CLANG He winces at the sound of his hammer striking the
BOLT Nothing he can do about it CLANG CLANG

INT PRIVATE QUARTERS - NIGHT

Nizam and Garsiv are seated at a long low table laid with
food Tamina waits on them setting down dishes pouring
wine etc She is careful never to let them get a good look
at her

WE HEAR the muffled sound of Dastan hammering the bolt off
screen somewhere a distant metallic ring

GARSIV
Did you hear that my Lord

NIZAM
What

Tamina arranging serving spoons begins loudly placing them
on the table -- PLING PLING PLING -- in time with
Dastan’s hammer

They glance in her direction distracted She bows and
mumbles an apology IN FOREIGN

INT CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Dastan puts down the mallet and screws the bolt the rest of
the way into the stone

Making sure the bolt is secure Dastan attaches a length of
rope to its head He circles the rope around a MASSIVE
PILLAR five feet in diameter on the other side of the
corridor creating a loop

Then Dastan turns this into a winch by threading an iron bar
through the rope and turning it around and around (Think
winding the rubber band of a toy airplane)

As the tension on the rope becomes greater Dastan struggles
harder and harder to turn the bar Finally there is a
scraping sound and

THE STONE BLOCK BEGINS TO SLIDE OUT

INT PRIVATE QUARTERS - NIGHT
Tamina walks into the room with a steaming tray of rice
Nizam pushes his plate away and prepares to stand

NIZAM
I want to get back to the dig to
see what progress has been made

Garsiv sets down his fork mid-bite

GARSIV
Of course I will come with you

NIZAM
Let us stop by the vault first to
make sure everything is secure

Tamina’s face registers alarm Nizam is already on his feet
Garsiv is taking a last swig of wine She has to act fast

Tamina steps forward collides with Nizam and spills hot
rice all over Garsiv’s lap

Garsiv leaps to his feet with a roar upsetting the table
Wine and food go all over his clothes

GARSIV
You clumsy fool

Tamina spits out a stream of apologies IN FOREIGN She
starts wiping Garsiv with a CLOTH Other Alamut SERVING
GIRLS rush in to help

It’s chaos Tamina whispers an instruction to one of the
girls and slips out of the room

INT CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Dastan has repeated the process to pull more stone blocks
free creating a tunnel-like opening through the wall barely

wide enough to crawl through

Dastan glances over his shoulder no sign of Tamina He
hesitates then squeezes into the opening

INT PRIVATE QUARTERS - NIGHT

Garsiv is tied up by a cluster of distractingly lovely Alamut
virgins who are doing a very thorough job of wiping off his
shirt and pants presumably at Tamina’s instruction

Nizam smells a rat

NIZAM
Enough

The girls back off Nizam looks around the room at them
NIZAM (CONTD)
Where is the girl who was serving
us
SMASH CUT TO
TAMINA

Running down the hallway

INT PRIVATE QUARTERS

Nizam is already pushing the Alamut girls aside heading for
the door

NIZAM
The dagger

CUT TO

INT TREASURE VAULT
THE DAGGER

As Dastan reaches into the glass case and lifts it out He
holds it aloft for a moment then tucks it into his belt

He HEARS something behind him and turns to see
TAMINA
Wriggling through the hole in the wall

DASTAN
What took you so long

INT PALACE HALLWAY

Nizam and Garsiv sweep through the chambers toward the VAULT
The GUARDS step back to let them pass They arrive at

THE INNER CHAMBER

Nizam takes the chain from around his neck and fits the great
key into the lock

INT TREASURE VAULT

Dastan HEARS the sound of the key in the lock

Tamina HEARS the heavy footsteps of soldiers approaching down
the corridor they crawled in from

TAMINA
They’re coming

Dastan slings a coil of rope over his shoulder He takes a
deep breath and backs up as far as he can in the tiny room

He gets a three-step start and begins running up the walls

He bounces off each wall as he spirals upwards Jet-Li style
It’s like he’s climbing a vertical staircase

Fifteen feet twenty twenty-five he’s practically
horizontal by the time he--

Grabs the window sill

Dastan hoists himself up into the slit of an opening and
drops the rope back down for Tamina
INT INNER CHAMBERTREASURE VAULT

Nizam turns the lock and steps aside The two GIANTS slide
the door open Nizam and Garsiv charge inside and find

The GLASS CASE IS EMPTY

LOW ANGLE SHOT - far above their heads as they stare down at
the empty case Dastan is hauling Tamina up unnoticed

Nizam looks around the room and spots the hole in the wall
Finally he looks upward -- just a half-second after Tamina
has disappeared

He turns to Garsiv
NIZAM

(quietly furious)
Seal the Palace

EXT PALACE ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Dastan and Tamina race across the rooftop As the soldiers
below buzz like a hive of angry bees they make their escape
descending by rope down a dark side of the building

CUT TO

EXT ALAMUT - NIGHT

Dastan and Tamina finally stop running and take shelter ina
dark archway to catch their breath Dastan peeks out to
check no sign of pursuit

DASTAN
Nobody followed us

Giddy with success she embraces him

TAMINA
That was incredible

After a moment however her smile fades Her eyes drift to
the dagger in his belt

Dastan glances down at it as well He takes it out

DASTAN
The quest for this dagger has
brought tragedy to both of our
kingdoms It belongs in the hands
of those to whom it was entrusted
I make no claim on it

He hands it to her
ON TAMINA touched and overwhelmed by his gesture

TAMINA
Thank you

She steps up on tip toe and kisses him This time he’s not
taken completely by surprise He kisses her back

A movie star kiss

TAMINA (CONTD)
Come with me We’1ll take the
dagger far away from here where it
will be safe from your uncle

Dastan is tempted But he shakes his head

DASTAN
I can’t Tamina I have to tell my
brother about Nizam’s treachery and
clear my name

Tamina realizes what he intends and is suddenly worried

TAMINA
Between you and your brother is an
entire army Dastan You’1ll be
dead before you ever reach him

DASTAN
I may not be first born but I’m
still the son of a King I have to
try

He takes a last look at her and turns to go

Tamina’s heart is in her throat She watches him walk away
into the shadows

TAMINA
Wait

She catches up with him
TAMINA (CONTD)
The only way one man can evade one

hundred is with the help of the
gods

She takes out the dagger

TAMINA (CONTD)
Let’s refill the dagger

He stares at her

DASTAN
Are you sure

TAMINA
(smiles )
My people are enslaved but I’m
still the daughter of a King I
must try to free them I believe
that you are our best hope Dastan

They share a look Dastan nods buoyed by her faith in him

EXT COURTYARD - MORNING

The SUN RISES casting a sharp shadow over the ancient Sun
DIAL WE HEAR the sound of pickaxes rhythmically chopping at
stone and overseers cracking their whips as the excavation
continues

EXT SECRET ENTRANCE - MORNING

Tamina leads Dastan to a distant corner of the courtyard
She locates a brick with a faded image of a lion’s face and a
sun dial

Tamina mutters the words of an ancient incantation IN
FOREIGN then places the palm of her hand on the sun dial and
turns it counter-clockwise CLICK

A beat A deep grinding sound as a secret door in the wall
slides open revealing a narrow staircase descending into
darkness

INT SECRET ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER

Dastan follows Tamina down the stairs When they reach the
bottom Tamina lights a torch

The flames illuminate a musty passageway Hushed echoing
An underground RIVER flows somewhere out of sight

Carved into the stone wall is an enormous LION FACE
primitive and terrifying superimposed on a sun dial

TAMINA
This place is sacred There’s a
ritual for how you approach it
The sun god will be angry if we
don’t show respect Never touch
the statues of the sun god It’s
forbidden

DASTAN
Your sun god is a lion
(off her reproachful look)
All right I’11 just follow you

As they pass the lion Tamina bows to it and utters
respectful prayers Dastan half-heartedly follows suit

Tamina’s torch illuminates the stone floor as they go She
grabs Dastan to stop him from stepping in a certain place

TAMINA
Do you see that black paving-stone

Dastan looks closely he can make out a few flakes of what
might have been black paint a thousand years ago

DASTAN
I wouldn’t call it black Maybe
it’s a little bit darker than the
others

TAMINA
The black stones represent man’s
wickedness Don’t step on them
It’s forbidden

Dastan looks skeptical
TAMINA (CONTD)
Forbidden You do not want to

anger the sun god

DASTAN
Forbidden Okay I got it

She leads the way down the passage Dastan follows

EXT COURTYARD - DAY

Nizam oversees the dig He consults an ancient manuscript
covered in Arabic script with drawings of an underground
hourglass and a dagger in the margin He closes it when
Garsiv arrives

GARSIV
We have looked everywhere my Lord

NIZAM
If you haven’t found them you
haven’t looked everywhere Keep
searching

INT BROKEN BRIDGE CHASM

Tamina and Dastan come to a halt at the edge of a water-
filled chasm where a rope bridge used to be Remnants of
rope dangle uselessly from either side The rock wall has
partially collapsed smashing the bridge and flooding the
chasm with water

TAMINA
They must have weakened that wall
with their digging Now we can’t
get across

Dastan’s eyes rove the far wall

DASTAN
I think I can

TAMINA
How

Dastan backs up for a running start Tamina grabs him

TAMINA (CONTD)
Don’t be a fool You can’t jump
that far

DASTAN
I know that I’m not crazy

He sprints toward the edge but instead of jumping the gap
he RUNS ALONG THE WALL for a good 20 feet until gravity
catches up with him his feet slip-slide and he starts to
fall

Dastan PUSHES OFF THE WALL with his feet propelling himself
across the gap -- GRABS a crevice in the rock wall opposite
barely saving himself from the plunge --

-- as SPIKES spring up below breaking the surface of the
muddy water covering the bottom of the pit Tamina gasps

Dastan begins to rock-climb across the wall using the most
miniscule hand and footholds He nearly falls -- more spikes
spring up below -- but he hangs on keeps going Tamina
watches holding her breath

At last Dastan reaches the far wall It’s sheer not a
handhold in sight He gropes for one anyway His hand SLIPS
on the slick rock

Tamina can’t look

The chasm is too wide at this end for Dastan to jump back to
the opposite wall Nevertheless he braces his feet against
the rock -- and LAUNCHES himself out into space

Sailing over the pit he GRABS the end of the broken rope
bridge as he falls past it Hangs on twisting and dangling
It holds

Dastan climbs up the rope bridge to safety Brushes himself
off then looks proudly back at Tamina

TAMINA
How do I get across

Dastan looks around There’s no way

DASTAN
We’1ll figure something out

TAMINA

No You’re almost there

(she takes out the dagger)
In the top of the hourglass is all
time yet to come In the bottom is
time past Between the two it
narrows to the width of a single
moment the Now That is where
you must insert the dagger’s tip

She tosses the dagger across the chasm Dastan catches it

TAMINA (CONTD)
The handle will fill with sand as
it falls This is important take
the dagger out as soon as it is
full Do not leave it in the
hourglass for longer

Their eyes meet across the chasm
DASTAN
Just make sure you’re here when I

get back

He disappears Tamina watches him go

TAMINA
Watch out for the black stones

EXT COURTYARD - DAY

A slave collapses from exhaustion There is a brief pause as
others stop to help him

Nizam pacing takes notice of the slowdown

NIZAM
Keep digging

The slaves are forced to return to their labors

INT HOURGLASS PASSAGEWAY

Dastan threads his way through a narrow corridor stepping
over the occasional black tile With each step he takes
nothing happens and he grows more confident

He comes to another stone LION like the first Sighing he
edges past hugging the opposite wall careful not to touch
it

DASTAN
Pardon me Lion I humbly beg your
permission to pass
(a glance upward)
God forgive me -- but she believes
in it so what am I to do

Dastan passes the lion and catches himself just about to step
on a faded black-painted stone

Looking ahead he realizes that half the paving stones in the
corridor ahead of him are black

With a martyred air he hop-scotches down the corridor from
one safe stone to the next until he reaches the alcove at
the passageway’s midpoint

As he pauses to take a breather Dastan’s eye is drawn to a
MURAL depicting the LEGEND an angry sun god with a lion’s
head a blinding sandstorm the hourglass Dastan gazes at
the ancient images in wonder maybe there’s more to this than
he thought

Dastan takes a deep breath and looks ahead the second half
of the passageway is filled with even more black stones

Carefully he hops between the increasingly scarce safe
stones To avoid getting stranded he’s forced to start
using the walls clinging to them like a rockclimber

At last the end of the black tiles comes into sight
Gritting his teeth he PUSHES off the wall with his feet
JUMPS through the air straining for distance--

He’s not going to make it Switching his landing to a dive
at the last instant he hits the floor with both hands
instead of his feet tumbles-- and clears it

Exhaling with relief he gets to his feet

And hears an ominous “snick” he’s never heard before
Looking down he sees he’s standing right on a BLACK STONE

He looks around for bad consequences Doesn’t see any

DASTAN (CONTD)
Sorry lion

THWIPP A SCYTHE comes swinging down from the ceiling
behind him Dastan jumps ASIDE barely escaping being
bisected vertically -- only to land on another black stone

FWIPP A HORIZONTAL SCYTHE whips out from the wall at knee
level The blade just misses him as he JUMPS BACK --

Triggering TWO MORE HORIZONTAL SCYTHES on the opposite wall
one at neck level one waist-high He escapes both by
THROWING HIMSELF FLAT--

-- Lands face down only to hear the telltale “snick” of his
weight depressing yet another black stone Uh-oh

Dastan ROLLS out of the way of one VERTICAL SCYTHE that whips
out of the floor -- lifts his legs just in time to escape
castration by ANOTHER -- and SOMERSAULTS past a third

He lands in a crouch looking around in wild terror
Miraculously he’s survived it all

DASTAN (CONTD)

(very fast heartfelt)
There is no god but God the
Almighty all-compassionate and all-
merciful Praise be to God You
alone do we worship Guide us on
the straight path Amen

(quick afterthought)
And no disrespect to the Lion

INT HOURGLASS CHAMBER
Dastan advances into the silent natural cavern

A waterfall cascades down a sheer rock face into the darkness
of an abyss We HEAR an underground river rushing far below

Towering at the edge of the abyss is a titanic HOURGLASS It
seems to have grown out of the rock itself It holds
thousands of tons of glowing white sand that bathe the
chamber in an eerie light

Fascinated Dastan approaches He stares at the sand
thousands of millions of years worth of time -- no way to
fathom it

He looks up at an ascending set of stairs carved into the
stone leading to a rock promontory at the neck of the
hourglass

He begins to climb the stairs At the top is a flat
outcropping of rock Above him looms the gigantic upper half
of the hourglass a vast reservoir of glowing sand

Dastan lies down and belly crawls until his head and
shoulders are over the edge of the abyss and he can reach the
neck of the hourglass

He draws the dagger Holding it carefully he brings its
blade to within an inch of the glass

DASTAN
God is great Bismillah

He pushes the dagger forward with no idea what will happen

The dagger’s point penetrates the thick glass instantly

rendered liquid as quicksilver Dastan’s so startled he

jerks it right back out again -- rendering the glass once
more magically intact

Deliberately Dastan repeats the action This time he holds
the dagger blade inside the hourglass to catch the falling
sand

The sand flows miraculously into the dagger blade and slowly
before his eyes the glass handle starts to fill

EXT COURTYARD IN THE PIT - DAY

A pick-axe breaks through the rock shelf triggering a
landslide beneath the diggers’ feet With SHOUTS of alarm
they slide toward the bottom their fellow diggers catch
them hanging on for dear life and pull them to safety

INT BROKEN BRIDGE CHASM

Tamina is startled to see new CRACKS suddenly appear in the
rock wall above the chasm WATER trickles through
suggesting a significant pressure build-up on the other side

Tamina backs away

The water BURSTS part of the wall pours through in a
torrent

INT HOURGLASS CHAMBER

Dastan realizes he’s been holding his breath With a gasp
he pulls the dagger back It’s full of glowing sand

The hourglass is as solid as if it had never been touched

INT HOURGLASS PASSAGEWAY

Dastan hop-scothes back through the corridor nimbly avoiding
the black stones

Until he lands precariously on a narrow space between two
black stones He loses his balance and reaches out to steady
himself Unwittingly his hand touches

The stone lion Dastan realizes what he’s done too late
Serrated IRON JAWS swing out from the horizontal slit of the
lion’s mouth Dastan hurdles over the jaws as they crunch
together like a giant bear-trap

As Dastan runs the corridor floor COLLAPSES under him
Desperately he increases his speed He can already see the
broken bridge ahead In a few more strides there’ll be no
floor left to run on He makes a heroic RUNNING JUMP--

out into space above the yawning chasm where the floor fell
in

And falls short He can’t believe it After everything he’s
been through this is how it ends -- plunging toward certain
death on JAGGED SPIKES below

As he’s about to be impaled he snatches the dagger from its
sheath --

BOOM TIME STOPS -- the spikes inches from Dastan’s chest
the entire scene frozen except for the SAND spilling from the
dagger in Dastan’s hand his finger on the jewel The sand
blows away like ash in the wind

REWIND

TIME RUNS BACKWARD Dastan flies up away from the spikes
the corridor floor reassembling under his feet as he runs
backwards JUMPS backward over the lion-jaws as they open--

Until his hand releases the jewel

INT HOURGLASS PASSAGEWAY SECOND TIME
This time Dastan makes the landing and rights himself

WITHOUT touching the lion And he’s through safely skirting
all the traps

INT BROKEN BRIDGE CHASM

WATER GUSHES IN swelling the already flooded pit while new
cracks pop up everywhere in the stressed rock wall Tamina
sees Dastan appear on the far side of the chasm

TAMINA
It’s collapsing

Dastan surveys the scene He sees that the rock wall is a
DAM ready to BURST--

Suddenly the edge where Tamina is standing COLLAPSES She
falls into the water

Without hesitation Dastan dives into the chasm and starts
swimming across dodging falling rocks and swirling currents

Tamina sees Dastan go under she looks around desperately
Dastan surfaces right in front of her

DASTAN
Take a deep breath

He grabs Tamina and pulls her down into the water

THE DAM BURSTS The wall caves in a THUNDER OF ROCK and
WATER are unleashed

UNDERWATER The explosive current propels Dastan and Tamina
through a stone-walled channel -- Dastan takes Tamina’s hand
kicks upward toward the LIGHT --

EXT RIVER — DAY

Dastan and Tamina surface in the river below the citadel
wall They gasp for air As soon as they catch their
breath

TAMINA
You used the dagger didn’t you

Battered half-dead with exhaustion Dastan hoists himself
onto the embankment

TAMINA (CONTD)
We have only one minute of sand to
get to your brother

Dastan looks at the dagger -- it’s half empty
Just then he dodges instinctively as an ARROW misses his
head by inches imbeds in the wall behind him Defensively

before Tamina can accuse him--

DASTAN
It missed by itself

ARCHERS assemble on the ramparts above Dastan and Tamina
race up the stone steps of the embankment

TAMINA
I just had the strangest feeling
we‘ve done this before

Dastan suddenly grabs her yanks her back

TAMINA (CONTD)
What

DASTAN
Wait

In the next instant a volley of ARROWS shoot past right in
front of Tamina Dastan releases her

DASTAN (CONTD)
Now

As they continue their dash up the stairs--

TAMINA
You did it again didn’t you

DASTAN
That time I did Trust me you
weren’t any happier the other way

INT HOURGLASS CHAMBER - DAY
The majestic hourglass sits in silent darkness

Suddenly a PICK breaks through the roof A shaft of
sunlight illuminates the chamber that has been dark for
centuries

Shouts of excitement from the workers above More picks chip
at the hole raining down rocks and debris

THE HOURGLASS as the rocks strike its surface it begins to
resonate like a great warning bell

EXT ROOFTOPS - DAY

Tamina takes Dastan’s arm points to the ROYAL PALACE
standing on the other side of a deep mountain gorge A
narrow stone bridge below is the only way across the chasm

TAMINA
That’s the palace just across that
bridge I know a place--

Dastan tackles her to the ground as a SPEAR hurtles through
the space where they were just standing

DASTAN
(not without pride)
God our soldiers are good

Tamina looks sees--—

A DOZEN SOLDIERS running toward them across the rooftops
More on their way throwing up ladders as they climb

Dastan yanks Tamina to her feet With the army on their
heels they improvise a rapid descent via stairs ladders and
free-fall to the bridge level

As they climb down the final ladder (Tamina first) more
soldiers run toward them from the bridge Dastan and Tamina
are trapped between the new arrivals and the soldiers above

Dastan reaches for the DAGGER Tamina stops him

TAMINA
No

Dastan grits his teeth All right he’1ll do it the hard way

He PUSHES OFF the wall with the ladder LANDS in a judo roll
that FLIPS the ladder over him-- tossing Tamina over the
heads of the soldiers in front of them Dastan continues his
momentum POLE-VAULTING over Tamina on the ladder This
master-stroke puts all the soldiers behind them leaving them
a clear path to the bridge

DASTAN
Run

EXT STONE BRIDGE - DAY

Dastan and Tamina make a mad dash across the bridge They’re
more than halfway there when MORE SOLDIERS appear on the far
side Dastan comes to a skidding stop

He looks back they’re trapped on a long narrow stone
bridge between two armies above a vertigo-inducing ravine
plunging ten thousand feet below

DASTAN
Should have used the dagger

With a communal ROAR the soldiers charge from both sides

Dastan swings into action Snatching up a rope coil he
swiftly ties it around a parapet of the bridge wall

wand draws his sword as the soldiers descend on them
Hopelessly outnumbered Dastan and Tamina leap onto the
bridge wall and run BACK the way they came-- Dastan parrying

sword blows and uncoiling rope as he runs

TAMINA
You can’t possibly--

DASTAN
Hold tight

Tamina locks her arms around Dastan just in time -- he JUMPS
THEY PLUMMET ON THE ROPE TOWARDS THE BOTTOMLESS GORGE

The rope stops their fall they start swinging back toward
the far side of the bridge-- incredibly straight for a tiny
ARCHER’S LOOPHOLE in the sheer fortress wall opposite
Dastan’s aim was brilliant

But not perfect

They slam into the wall below the loophole It’s just out of
their reach As they start swinging back--

DASTAN (CONTD)
Climb higher We’1l make it on the
next swing

Tamina and Dastan desperately climb up a few feet on the
rope ARCHERS on the bridge above them unleash a volley of
arrows which miss but don’t make their task any easier

They reach the apex of their backswing begin their return
toward the loophole Dastan reaches out to grab it--

Only this time they don’t even reach the wall They’ve lost
too much momentum

WIDE SHOT

Dastan and Tamina swing uselessly back and forth ina
smaller arc each time They’re trapped at the end of the
rope Hanging off a bridge that’s full of soldiers

Oops

ON THE BRIDGE

A soldier (call him the EXECUTIONER) mounts the parapet where
Dastan tied the rope He draws a wicked scimitar raises it

high-- and CHOPS

DASTAN and TAMINA are shaken One more cut will sever the
rope

TAMINA
All right Use the dagger

DASTAN
Oh I don’t know I think we can get
out of this one

TAMINA
Use the dagger NOW

The Executioner raises his scimitar for the coup de grace

Dastan releases one hand from the rope uses it to pull
Tamina toward him and gives her a passionate kiss

The sword cuts the rope Dastan and Tamina plunge into the
abyss then Dastan HITS the jewel

REWIND

Reversing through the kiss and all their back-and-forth
swings wider each time until they land back up on--
EXT STONE BRIDGE - DAY SECOND TIME

DASTAN
Hold tight

Exactly as before Tamina locks her arms around Dastan as he
JUMPS from the parapet

Only this time he adjusts his aim hastily CLIMBING the rope
as they swing hits the loophole grabs and pulls them in

EXT STONE BRIDGE - DAY

The EXECUTIONER stares down into the gorge dumbfounded at
the empty rope swinging below the bridge They’ve escaped

INT LOOPHOLE CORRIDOR - DAY
Tamina and Dastan land together on the floor

TAMINA
That was fantastic
(hesitates)
You didn’t use the dagger did you

DASTAN
What No Of course not

She’s not sure she believes him but there’s no time for
discussion They set off down the hall

EXT EXCAVATION PIT - DAY

Nizam stands on a platform and watches the slaves construct a
platform that can be lowered to the Hourglass far below

Garsiv gallops up dismounting before his horse comes to a
stop He runs to the edge of the pit

GARSIV
My Lord Nizam Dastan and the girl
have been spotted They just
slipped past a company of soldiers
near the Royal Palace

NIZAM
The Royal Palace Where is King
Tus

GARSIV

Returning from a hunt
NIZAM
(climbing out)
Send word that I must speak to him
Dastan must not reach him first

INT PALACE BACK STAIRSCORRIDORS - DAY

Dastan and Tamina race up stairs through corridors etc

DASTAN
I hope you know where you’re going

Tamina throws open the small wooden door of a supply closet
they duck inside She closes the door plunging them into
darkness

WE HEAR their breathing rapid and shallow then the click of
a hidden latch and another door swings open--

INT SECRET ROOM - SUNSET

Tamina lights a lantern revealing a cozy room rich with
curtains and draperies a tea service and silk cushions

DASTAN
A secret getaway

TAMINA
For the king I was a nosy little
girl always getting into places I
wasn’t supposed to

She parts a curtain revealing a short passageway that dead-
ends in a door Tamina slides open a peephole and looks

POV THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE

Servants fill the royal baths with hot water Tamina steps
aside to let Dastan look

TAMINA (CONTD)
The King’s private bath They’re
preparing it for him now When
your brother returns you’ll have a
chance to speak to him alone

She walks back into the secret room Dastan follows He
opens the shutter to look out the small window

On the stone bridge far below he sees dozens of soldiers
running around searching for the escaped fugitives

Dastan turns and looks at Tamina She is absently brushing
her hair in front of a mirror-- the first chance she’s had in
a long time

He’s gazing at her transfixed She catches him looking in
the mirror and turns

TAMINA (CONTD)
What

DASTAN
You look beautiful

She blushes He steps closer
DASTAN (CONTD)
You know when this is all over

If we succeed perhaps you and I--

Tamina stops him

TAMINA
(sadly)
It is not meant to be between us
Dastan

DASTAN
Why not

TAMINA
(takes a deep breath)
Because I am the Princess of
Alamut and we have traditions

DASTAN
(suddenly defensive)
And I’m only a fourth son

She shakes her head

TAMINA
That has nothing to do with it
According to our ancient and
immutable beliefs I can only marry
one who has been baptized in the
sacred fountain of Alamut It has
been this way for centuries

Dastan brightens

DASTAN
Oh So all I have to do is get
baptized in this fountain I don’t
think the Prophet forbids a little
dip--

TAMINA
You don’t understand You can’t be
baptized-- nobody can ever again
The sacred fountain of Alamut has
been destroyed

He falls silent Oh That’s a tougher problem
TAMINA (CONTD)
(wistfully)
I’m sorry Dastan

Dastan searches for the right words Then

A HORN BLAST outside signals the king’s arrival They hurry
to the window in time to see

TUS and a half-dozen GUARDS ride across the bridge

DASTAN
My brother

TAMINA
You should prepare yourself

INT ROYAL PALACE - NIGHT

Tus and his bodyguards stride across the great hall A YOUNG
GUARD steps forward and bows

GUARD
My King Nizam sends word that he
would speak with you

TUS
I’ve been riding all day I’1l see
him after I’ve bathed and changed

INT ROYAL BATHS - NIGHT

STEAM fills the room The King’s guards watch the ATTENDANTS
prepare the bath in a centuries-old Eastern ritual

AT THE SECRET ENTRANCE

Dastan watches through the peephole rehearsing nervously
under his breath

DASTAN
‘It was not I who killed our
father’ Can’t start with that
‘My brother it is I Dastan I
come to you in peace’ No time for
that get to the point ‘My
brother’ That’s a good start

DASTAN’S POV - the guards escort the attendants out Moments
later Tus enters The guards leave him alone to his bath

DASTAN (CONTD)
‘My brother’ ‘My noble brother’

Dastan turns and locks eyes with Tamina one last time she
gives him an encouraging nod Dastan presses on the door

IN THE BATHS

The secret door invisible in the tiled wall opens Dastan
steps through silently and disappears into the steam

TUS takes off his robe and lowers himself into the steaming
water Rinses his face and hair and sinks down He closes
his eyes

Suddenly he feels a draft Frowns Opens his eyes

DASTAN (CONTD)
My noble brother

Tus splashes to his feet waist-high in the water

TUS
GUARDS

DASTAN
No

TUS
GUARDS

Dastan throws his sword aside Holds up his hands-- unarmed

DASTAN
You have nothing to fear from me
What Nizam told you is a lie He
killed Father It was Nizam who
poisoned the robe

The GUARDS burst in and seize Dastan

DASTAN (CONTD)
Tus Nizam deceived us all He
made us conquer Alamut so he could
possess its secrets And if you
try to stop him he will kill you
too

TUS
Enough

Everyone falls silent Dastan ceases struggling and waits in
suspense for Tus’s next words

TUS (CONTD)
We are brothers Since childhood
I’ve known you as I know myself I
can tell by how artfully you’ve
rehearsed your speech that you are
lying

(MORE )
TUS (CONTD)
(to the guards)
Take him to Nizam
ANGLE ON TAMINA - watching through the peephole dismayed
Tus turns away as the guards drag Dastan off
DASTAN
No Tus listen to me I’m not
making this up TUS
Tus never looks back Dastan appeals to the guards
DASTAN (CONTD)
I beg you One minute Let me
speak to him As you love him as
you loved your king--

The CAPTAIN of the guards punches him in the head

CAPTAIN
Shut up you

Now Dastan’s mad With a herculean effort he yanks free
just enough to draw the dagger from his belt--

GUARD
He’s got a knife

--and hits the JEWEL BOOM TIME STANDS STILL

REWIND

INT ROYAL BATHS - NIGHT SECOND TIME

Tus takes off his robe lowers himself into the steaming
bath Rinses his face and hair just as he did before

A NOISE makes Tus turn Dastan has just BARRICADED the door
with a medieval two-by-four Tus splashes to his feet This
time the first thing Dastan does is throw his sword away

DASTAN
Tus don’t call the guards yet
Listen to me

TUS
GUARDS

Dastan winces continues improvising
DASTAN
Beneath this citadel is an ancient
mystical force beyond anything you
can imagine It’s the hourglass
that contains the Sands of Time

SOUNDS of the guards beating at the barricaded door--
DASTAN (CONTD)
This dagger holds only a minute’s

worth of the sand

He draws the dagger forgetting it’s a weapon too--

TUS
Coward Do you attack me thus
unarmed

DASTAN
No

Hastily turning the dagger around-- this isn’t going well

DASTAN (CONTD)
Nizam is after the hourglass and
the dagger He tricked us into
falsely invading a kingdom that has
done us no wrong To hide his
lies he murdered our father and
threw the blame on me

The door gives way the guards burst in Dastan doesn’t have
to wait for Tus’s verdict to know he’s blown it

DASTAN (CONTD)
(angry with himself)
Damn it

He jumps back using the dagger to hold the guards at bay

DASTAN (CONTD)
Stand back I warn you

The guards hesitate perplexed In a second they’1ll realize
there’s no real threat and rush him

DASTAN (CONTD)
I need a minute Just give me a
minute to think

He looks at the dagger in his hand -- nearly empty Just
enough sand for one last rewind
Suddenly desperately he looks at Tus He knows what to do

DASTAN (CONTD)
Tus this is no ordinary dagger
Touch this jewel on its handle and
you will learn Alamut’s greatest
secret

TUS
(to the guards)
Enough Take him to Nizam

As the guards move forward Dastan swiftly brings the
dagger’s blade to his own throat Again they hesitate

DASTAN
(to Tus)
If you won’t believe me then our
kingdom is forfeit Our honor is
forfeit And I’m better off dead

Dastan PLUNGES the dagger into his own heart Under the
astonished stares of the guards he crumples to his knees
Blood appears on his lips He falls dead

ON TAMINA - who stifles a cry

Tus shakes off the guard who’s just helped him put on his
robe He advances toward his brother’s body

CAPTAIN
My lord if it’s a trick

Tus turns Dastan over He’s dead the hilt of the dagger
protruding from his chest Tus pulls it out The blade is
wet with blood

Tus examines the dagger The unearthly glowing white sand
inside its handle For a moment we think he’s going to do
something with it-- but he just lays the dagger back down on
the floor

ON TAMINA - who pulls away from the peephole tears streaming
down her face She can’t look

The Captain tries to escort Tus out of the baths but Tus
lingers troubled

TUS
He took his own life
CAPTAIN
A coward’s way out

TUS
My brother was no coward

He bends and picks up the dagger again Presses the jewel

TIME STOPS The last sands fall from the dagger a draft
blows them away through the steam frozen in midair

REWIND

INT ROYAL BATHS - NIGHT THIRD TIME

The guards close in on Dastan just as they did before Tus
whirls bewildered by deja vu what’s happening here

As he did before Dastan dramatically holds the dagger to his
own throat -- unaware that the final rewind has already
happened and that the dagger is empty

DASTAN
If you won’t believe me then our
kingdom is forfeit Our honor is
forfeit And I’m better off dead

Tus lunges at Dastan GRABS his arm just in time to prevent
him from stabbing himself The guards pull them apart

TUS
Let him go

Cowed by the royal command in his voice the guards obey

DASTAN
Thanks brother

TUS
(wonderment )
You were dead I saw the blood

DASTAN
Blood What blood

Perplexed he looks down at the dagger in his hand He
nearly faints on seeing that it’s empty Tus overcome by
emotion clasps Dastan in a warm embrace
TUS
My brother On the day we left for
war our father told me ‘A king

should listen always to the voice
of reason-- but also listen to your
heart’ My heart knew you could
not have done what they accused you
of I should have listened

Dastan nods still a bit shaky Tus turns
TUS (CONTD)

Send for a detachment of soldiers
from my most trusted regiment

The Captain nods and exits Tus turns back to Dastan

TUS (CONTD)
Come We must find Nizam

DASTAN
One more thing brother There is
somebody I want you to meet
Dastan turns toward the secret door as

TAMINA emerges like a vision from the steam

Tus looks at his younger brother impressed
her

DASTAN (CONTD)
It’s a long story

EXT STONE BRIDGE - NIGHT

where’d you get

Thunder rumbles in an ominous sky Tus Dastan and Tamina
stride across the bridge accompanied by FOUR ROYAL GUARDS

Nizam appears at the end of the bridge with his own

detachment of SIX ELITE GUARDS led by Garsiv

TUS
Keep your swords sheathed

As the two small groups come together Nizam speaks first

NIZAM
O King

TUS
Nizam you have committed treason
and murder and have conspired to
cast the blame on my brother
(to Garsiv)
Captain of the Guards I order you
to arrest this traitor

Garsiv steps forward and looks Nizam in the eye then he
turns and nods to the GUARDS surrounding Tus

Tus’s own guards grab him Dastan and Tamina bind their
hands behind their backs and force them to their knees

TUS (CONTD)
Who dares lay a hand on Tus son of
Shahraman your King

NIZAM
I have heard that name enough

Nizam glances at Garsiv who plucks Dastan’s sword from him
and raises it high

DASTAN
NO

Garsiv brings the sword slashing down We don’t see the
impact only the men’s reactions

Tus lies dead on the stone bridge a spreading pool of blood
beneath him in the light rain

Garsiv throws the sword down It clatters next to Dastan

GARSIV
Your sword

A CLATTERING OF HOOVES signals the arrival of the detachment
of loyal soldiers with the CAPTAIN sent to fetch them

NIZAM
Ho Help Murder

Dastan opens his mouth to protest but Garsiv’s men silence
him with a rain of kicks and blows As the loyal SOLDIERS
arrive on the scene Nizam steps forward in apparent anguish

NIZAM (CONTD)
God help us We arrived too late
Our King is dead-- slain by Dastan
who killed his father
Dastan tries to speak but Garsiv’s men redouble their blows

TAMINA
He’s lying Dastan is innocent

GARSIV
This is the daughter of our enemy
He would have conspired with her to
lead the people of this city
against us

An angry murmur rises from among the detachment of loyal
soldiers eager for revenge on their king’s murderer

NIZAM
(steps in)
I shall take charge of questioning
Dastan and his accomplice I will
find out the full extent of this
conspiracy

Garsiv and his men hustle Tamina and Dastan along the bridge
drowning their protests leaving the Captain and the soldiers
staring mournfully down at Tus’s body in the rain

INT DUNGEON - NIGHT

Tamina and Dastan are shoved into a cell and chained to the
wall The guards exit

Nizam steps forward and lifts the DAGGER from Dastan’s belt

NIZAM
You squandered your opportunity
Dastan You stood before the
hourglass with the dagger in your
hand yet the limit of your
ambition was to turn back time
sixty seconds

He shakes his head

TAMINA
To do more is forbidden

Nizam ignores her continues speaking to Dastan
NIZAM

A failure of imagination I will
use it to change my destiny
DASTAN
You mean usurp my father’s place

NIZAM
Had I not saved his life the
throne was rightfully mine I
shall merely go back and let nature
take its course

DASTAN
My father treated you with nothing
but love and honor And this is
how you repay him

NIZAM
Love and honor I lived under his
thumb my entire life You of all
people should understand what
that’s like nephew-- to be better
and smarter than your brothers yet
to live in their shadow because of
the accident of birth

DASTAN
I would not betray my family to
change my place

NIZAM
I felt the same way when I was your
age Dastan Trust me-- it wears
thin over time

TAMINA
Nizam you cannot do this You
will anger the sun god

NIZAM

Superstition girl

(to Dastan)
Foreknowledge of the future will
make me the wisest of rulers--
laying in grain before the famine
comes building high walls when
there is yet no enemy in sight I
shall be a great king It’s
unfortunate that you will not be
born to reap this golden age
Dastan You were the only one in
the family I ever liked

As Nizam leaves he summons the GUARDS
NIZAM (CONTD)
Unchain the girl I promised
Garsiv he could have her to enjoy
(apologetic to Dastan)
I have to keep him happy for a
little longer

Tamina is freed and dragged away struggling

DASTAN
Nizam Nizam NIZAM

He ducks under one of the chains turning himself around so
he’s facing the wall with his arms crossed He repeats the
maneuver each time giving the chains another twist until
he’s close enough to brace his feet against the wall Then
PULLS until he’s screaming in agony

INT DUNGEON - LATER

Dastan is barely conscious His chains haven’t budged

The distant NOISE of a door closing half-rouses him
Dastan’s lips are parched his eyes glassy and delirious

DASTAN
Tamina Tamina

Guards enter and unchain him from the wall Dastan is limp
and unresisting unaware of what’s happening

GUARD

He’s half-dead already Why bother
with an execution

INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Prisoners stare through the bars as the guards drag Dastan
out The cells are packed with MEN of Alamut sullen and

fierce

Farood slumped disconsolately in a cell with the other
nomads is appalled to recognize Dastan

FAROOD
Ali They got you too

As Dastan passes Farood grips the bars shouts--
FAROOD (CONTD)
Ali I am sorry We should never
have come to this city

Dastan springs into action revealing that he’s been playing
possum Using his chains as weapons he attacks the guards
More guards pour in shouting for back up

Dastan is a one-man army fighting six at once in the narrow
corridor Unable to rid himself of his chains he loops them
over a ceiling hook and becomes a circus acrobat spinning

and KICKING off the walls to clobber one guard after another

The prisoners rush to the bars their shouts adding to the
fearsome din The little Gypsy Boy stares with open-mouthed
hero worship

FAROOD (CONTD)
Ali you amaze me

One unlucky guard flung against the bars is grabbed by
Farood’s daughters who tie him in place with his own turban

DASTAN
Get his keys

Nomad hands reach through the bars frisk the guard

FAROOD
Nothing

Dastan clobbers another guard sends him Farood’s way The
nomad women frisk the guard-- no luck More soldiers arrive
making things hotter for Dastan every moment

FAROOD (CONTD)
Try the fat one there

INT TENT - NIGHT
Garsiv enters and gazes at Tamina seated on low cushions her
wrists bound Without taking his eyes off of her he speaks

to the guard

GARSIV
Untie her And leave us
INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Dastan fights desperately outnumbered Farood comes up
triumphantly holding KEYS

FAROOD
I got it

DASTAN
So open something

Farood methodically tries one key after the next to open the
nomads’ cell while Dastan battles to stay alive

FAROOD
Tell me Ali what was your crime

Dastan doesn’t have time to breathe much less answer as he
dodges a killing blow from another guard

FAROOD (CONTD)
Ah your hands are full You will
never believe how I came to be in
this awful place

Dastan’s in trouble three guards strangling him with his own
chains

FAROOD (CONTD)
I was arrested for ‘war
profiteering’ Can you believe
that A man comes to do business
and he is punished for fair trade--
ah here it is

Farood unlocks the cell The nomads swarm out and overwhelm
the guards rescuing Dastan in the nick of time

FAROOD’S DAUGHTERS finish them off with savage gusto
FAROOD (CONTD)
You see I told you they were
strong
Dastan Farood and the nomads hurry down the corridor past
cells packed with men of Alamut who rattle the bars and shout

in Foreign at the escaping prisoners

Dastan pauses on the threshold of freedom Looks back
FAROOD (CONTD)
Ali-- come

DASTAN
No These men are prisoners
because of me I ama king’s son

FAROOD
(nods understandingly)
A blow on the head can cause such
delusions Fresh air and freedom
are the cure

He pulls at Dastan’s arm but Dastan shakes him off To
Farood’s horror Dastan takes the keys and unlocks the first
cell

With a ROAR the prisoners charge out Dastan climbs onto a
barrel and shouts over the commotion

DASTAN
Men of Alamut hear me It is
Dastan prince of Nasaf who calls
to you

Farood winces-- this delusion is worse than he thought The
men of Alamut react with angry mutters that swell
dangerously

DASTAN (CONTD)
Well may you hate me-- as a
foreigner as an invader Were I
in your place my blood would cry
out for vengeance for your
conquered land

Farood is startled as it dawns on him Dastan is a prince
His expression transforms to one of respect and awe

DASTAN (CONTD)
Yet my land too is conquered-- from
within by a usurper Help me
defeat him and I will give you
back your kingdom I swear it in
the name of my father Shahraman

Dastan pauses for effect Farood whispers in his ear
FAROOD

Ali they don’t understand your
language
Dismayed Dastan surveys his audience realizes it’s true

At that moment several of the Alamut men succeed in smashing
open the ARMORY Spears and weapons are passed out Dastan
and Farood are in the center of a hostile well-armed mob

Just then a battalion of Nasaf SOLDIERS charge in diverting
the prisoners’ attention

DASTAN
(with hand gestures)
Fight them No them

A full scale battle erupts

FAROOD
Ali Well said Now let’s get out
of here

Dastan doesn’t argue this time Taking advantage of the
confusion they slip out of the melee

EXT EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

Dastan Farood and the nomads emerge through a narrow doorway
onto the citadel embankment above the river Farood
breathes in the free air--

Dastan pushes him down just in time to dodge a hail of
arrows Nasaf SOLDIERS on horseback ride to intercept them

Dastan and the nomad bandits throw themselves into a pitched
battle The Giant Bandit fights three soldiers at once he
plucks one from the saddle and hurls him to an icy fate in
the river below

Dastan gets hold of the horse and swings into the saddle

DASTAN
Farood Hold them as long as you
can
FAROOD
(offended)

Now that you’re a king’s son you
are leaving us

DASTAN
Farood I need to save her
FAROOD
Bukbuk Why didn’t you say so

Dastan smiles As he prepares to depart

A new wave of NASAF SOLDIERS gallops toward them The nomads
are desperately outnumbered but then

The faces of the Nasaf Soldiers shift from glee to fear as

The just-liberated Alamut men surge from the prison with a
terrifying ROAR Farood grins

FAROOD (CONTD)
Go

Dastan gallops off

EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT
Guards open the door to an iron CAGE suspended with ropes and

pulleys over the pit Nizam steps inside and they begin to
lower him toward the hourglass

INT GARSIV’S TENT - NIGHT

Garsiv ducks as Tamina throws a vase at his head He laughs
and pursues her around the bed

GARSIV
A feisty one aren’t you

CRASH The next vase connects with his face He finds that
slightly less amusing Shakes it off and gives chase

EXT GARSIV’S TENT COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

Tamina bursts out of the tent with Garsiv on her heels She
makes it about twenty feet before he brings her down with a
tackle from behind

He forces her onto her back and pins her arms

GARSIV
Not so cocky now are we

DASTAN (VO)
GARSIV
He turns as Dastan rides up and leaps from his horse

DASTAN (CONTD)
You always said youd take me in a
real fight instead of a contest
now’s your chance

Two GUARDS arrive and fit arrows to their bows ready to
shoot Dastan Garsiv holds up a hand

GARSIV
No I want to kill him myself
(to Dastan)
I’ve waited a long time for this
moment Dastan

He hands Tamina off to another pair of guards who pin her
arms tightly

GARSIV (CONTD)
Let her watch

Garsiv draws his sword Dastan draws his They circle one
another for several moments

Then the two fighters fall upon one another in a fury of
steel-on-steel It’s a perfect match of skill determination
and mutual hatred

Back and forth they battle trading blows and parries

Dastan is quicker but Garsiv is the stronger With every
blow Dastan loses a little edge Garsiv gradually begins to
force Dastan backwards toward the edge of the pit

TAMINA struggles against the two Guards holding her tight

Garsiv gives Dastan a vicious kick to the stomach that sends
him to the ground Garsiv smiles moving in for the kill

GARSIV (CONTD)
This is not a tournament Dastan
Your fancy tricks won’t save you
now

Dastan scrambles to his feet in time to block the attack but
he’s on his heels his back to the edge of the massive pit
With a powerful blow Garsiv knocks Dastan’s sword from his
hand Dastan is helpless on the brink of the precipice

Garsiv takes one last big two-handed swing at Dastan aiming
to cut him in half Dastan does an impossible back bend over
the pit like a limbo dancer hanging by his toes

SWOOSH Garsiv’s sword slices air inches above Dastan’s
nose His momentum carries Garsiv around like a baseball
slugger missing a strike

Dastan spins low on one pivot foot extending the opposite
leg hitting GARSIV at the back of the knees-- TOPPLING him
over the cliff edge face forwards

Tamina’s GUARDS step forward with a gasp as if they could
catch Garsiv MISTAKE

Tamina plucks a sword from a Guard’s belt Ina flash she
strikes them down

The other two Guards turn to face her warily Dastan
scrambles to his feet and starts to come to her aid--

TAMINA
Never mind me Stop Nizam

Tamina raises her sword to fight the two guards

TAMINA (CONTD)
Go

INT HOURGLASS CHAMBER - NIGHT

With a cranking of wheels the CAGE comes to a halt in front
of the hourglass Crumbling rockslides and running water
create a non-stop shower of debris falling around the chamber
and into the abyss Nizam pays no attention staring in
wonder at the bright sand inches from his face He feels
the solid glass

NIZAM
(closes his eyes)
This is my destiny

He raises the dagger to strike the hourglass

Suddenly with a great RATTLING NOISE the cage shoots upwards
Nizam turns--

DASTAN
No this is your destiny

--and Dastan clobbers him with both feet a human
counterweight descending on the other end of the rope Nizam
is sent sprawling the dagger lands on the rocks out of
both of their reach
Nizam gets to his feet scowling He draws both his swords
Dastan draws his one They square off to duel

Nizam’s two sword technique is unlike any fighting style
weve seen He wields the swords with such skill and
dexterity that Dastan struggles to defend himself

NIZAM
Soon you shall be nothing more than
a dream that no one will remember

Nizam presses the pace attacking from both sides

Dastan makes a last desperate counter-attack and suddenly--
KNOCKS one of Nizam’s swords from his hand

A beat New ball game
Nizam swings with his remaining sword-- Dastan blocks the
blow confidently With locked blades Dastan presses for the
advantage his youth and strength coming into play
A look of fear crosses Nizam’s face Dastan grins
DASTAN
Not so confident with only one

blade

But then Dastan coughs Blood trickles from his mouth He
looks down

Nizam has drawn a hidden short sword with his other hand and
plunged it into Dastan’s side mortally wounding him

NIZAM
I always keep a spare

Nizam leaves Dastan bleeding on the ground and retrieves the
dagger Again he approaches the hourglass

And AGAIN as he is poised to strike the CAGE flies down and
Tamina leaps out to stop him

TAMINA
DONT

But this time Nizam is ready He sidesteps her attack
disarms her and grabs her by the throat He lifts her bodily
and holds her over the abyss
NIZAM
(looks at her)
A very pretty face indeed
Perhaps when you are born twenty
years from now I will do you the
honor of making you one of my
wives

Dastan lifts his head and sees Nizam dangling Tamina

NIZAM (CONTD)
but right now you are a nuisance

And with that he releases her

DASTAN
No

Dastan hears her screams echo into the distance as she falls
With every last bit of his strength he pulls himself up

Nizam climbs the steps to the hourglass He takes out the
dagger and raises it high

He strikes Just then
DASTAN lunges into frame grabbing his hand to stop him Too

late Nizam plunges the dagger into the glass not just the
tip he buries the blade all the way up to the hilt

TIME STOPS

Falling rocks and water frozen in midair Dastan and Nizam
grappling like two statues faces contorted--

In the silence resounds a booming NOISE like ice cracking
The CRACK spreads across the surface of the hourglass from
the place where the dagger penetrated it And--

SAND starts to pour from the crack

TIME RUNS BACKWARD Rocks and water fly back upward-- the
REWIND ACCELERATING as the crack in the hourglass widens the
glowing white SAND pouring out at an ever-faster rate--

DASTAN and NIZAM

Are untouched in the eye of the storm in the blinding LIGHT
of the hourglass Both of their hands are on the dagger

THE REWIND
Becomes a blur through which we catch quick glimpses of
previous action Dastan fighting Garsiv Tus’s murder on the
bridge Tamina and Dastan kissing etc

IN THE COURTYARD the shadow of the minaret races backwards
around the sun dial as night reverses to dawn

All the while SAND keeps pouring from the hourglass-- now in
a torrent swept by the wind into a blinding SANDSTORM that
threatens to grow out of control

DASTAN as if stunned by a concussion shakes himself awake
to realize he’s there with Nizam in the bright ROARING
center of the sandstorm

Nizam in ecstasy holds the dagger in place -- SAND pouring
out of what is no longer the hourglass but a CRACK in the
very surface of the universe

Savagely Nizam pries Dastan’s hand from the dagger Dastan
hangs on too weak to fight back The wind rips at him if
he lets go he’1ll be sucked into oblivion

Nizam gives Dastan a sharp elbow Dastan is nearly swept off
by the wind-- but he keeps a hold

Dastan looks down sees blood soaking his tunic His life is
ebbing away he can’t hang on much longer

Then out of the maelstrom of events REWINDING all around
them an IMPLOSION of light in the dawn sky attracts Dastan’s
attention Hazily looking up he sees a flaming arrow arcing
backward through the sky the opening battle

Dastan summons the last of his strength and will Bearing
down on Nizam’s arm he PULLS OUT THE DAGGER

In that instant the crack in the hourglass repairs itself
as it magically did when Dastan withdrew the dagger before
At the same time the SANDSTORM sweeps both Nizam and Dastan
into the void

For a few moments SAND is all we see and hear Then little
by little the SANDSTORM starts to clear

Dastan looks around At first he can’t tell where he is
The sand is everywhere In his teeth in his hair He
searches himself for the dagger He doesn’t have it

Gradually he starts to make out other figures nearby
Persian soldiers shouting in the wind Horses whinny
With a shock of dread Dastan realizes-—-

EXT BELOW THE CITADEL - SUNRISE

We’‘re reliving the opening battle The Persian army is
already charging toward Alamut-- beginning the whole thing
over with the inexorability of a nightmare

DASTAN
No No
EXT RAMPARTS - SUNRISE
Lashed by sand and wind the Alamut Sentry grabs a stick and
beats the gong in warning as he did the first time
INT TAMINA’S BEDROOM - SUNRISE

The GONG awakens Tamina Sand is blowing into the room

EXT BELOW THE CITADEL - SUNRISE

Tus raises his sword and lets out a WAR CRY exactly
repeating his action of the opening sequence From the ranks
rises a blood-curdling noise as thousands of voices join him

Only one thing has changed Dastan Outwardly he’s the
same but his faces shows a new maturity and resolve He
knows what he must do

Dastan looks to the ramparts and sees the flaming arrow
launched into the air

DASTAN
No

He rides toward Tus shouting--

DASTAN (CONTD)
Tus Call off the attack

The arrow explodes into a shower of brilliant fireworks
illuminating the scene like a lightning flash

Nizam on horseback suddenly blocks Dastan’s way He
strikes nearly knocking Dastan off his horse
Dastan tries to ride past but Nizam maneuvers to block him
Their eyes meet both held the dagger both remember
everything

They clash on horseback-- Dastan parries Nizam’s double-
bladed attack The duel begins while around them the Alamut
archers begin to pick off Persian soldiers creating chaos as
before

Tus in the vanguard looks around and sees-—-
Dastan and Nizam dueling His face contorts with anger

TUS
Dastan

He does not know why his hot-headed younger brother is
fighting with Nizam but he knows Dastan’s immaturity is
jeopardizing the battle Enraged Tus rides back

NIZAM AND DASTAN

fight furiously As before Dastan’s on the defensive A
growing circle of onlookers gathers uncertain whether to
intervene

NIZAM
(to the men)
Traitor The King’s son would
betray us to our enemy

DASTAN
He’s lying

The battlefield around them is chaos-- soldiers felled by
arrows catapults erupting in FLAMES

Nizam’s personal guards ride toward the dueling pair A
handful of common footsoldiers block their way with spears

BRUTISH SOLDIER
Oh no This stays a fair fight

In a bold and desperate move Dastan stands up on his saddle
and launches himself at Nizam knocking him off his horse
They roll together on the ground Nizam lands on his back
Dastan straddling him sword raised--

Tus arrives on horseback forcing his way through the circle

TUS
Hold HOLD
Dastan freezes inches from killing Nizam He can’t disobey
his brother

Nizam’s right hand creeps along the ground toward his sword
that landed inches away

DASTAN
Tus call off the attack It’sa
trick Nizam lied to us

NIZAM
We can win Dastan is a traitor

TUS
Dastan put down your sword

DASTAN
No

Tus can’t believe Dastan’s insubordination

TUS
What did you say

DASTAN
We have no reason to attack Alamut
This is all a part of his plan
Menacingly Tus draws his own sword
TUS
He is your uncle and your elder
Put down your sword

The threat is clear Still Dastan hesitates

Nizam sees his chance His right hand closes on his sword
hilt he swings upward at Dastan’s neck--

Dastan sees the sword coming BLOCKS it--

As Nizam expected he pulls out the hidden short sword with
his OTHER hand and strikes toward Dastan’s exposed torso--

But this time Dastan knows it’s coming with blinding speed
Dastan turns BLOCKS the second blow and drives his sword
like a stake into Nizam’s heart

The men watching are stunned Nizam can’t believe it either

He coughs And then he’s dead
Dastan hurls his sword away from him it sticks quivering in
the frozen ground He stands to face Tus

DASTAN
Kill me if you must But call off
the attack for Alamut is
blameless Examine closely the
documents Nizam showed us-- they
are fake

Dastan advances making it easier for Tus to kill him

DASTAN (CONTD)
Tus do you remember Father’s words
to you on a the day we left for
war ‘A king must listen always to
the voice of reason’

TUS
(mystified)
How could

DASTAN
‘but also listen to your heart’

Tus stares at him Dastan meets his gaze calmly resolute
This is not the younger brother he knew It’s as if Dastan’s
matured overnight

Tus turns and shouts--

TUS
Halt Retreat

His orders echo through the ranks repeated by the commanders
at every level
EXT BATTLEMENT - SUNRISE

An Alamut PRIEST takes the dagger from an ornate box and is
about to entrust it to the Fearsome armored Warrior when--

Alamut soldiers come running bearing news shouting The
Priest looks out over a parapet

Below the great wave of men moving toward the castle has
stopped The Persian army is turning around

The Priest looks at the dagger in his hand utters a silent
PRAYER of thanks and replaces it in its box
EXT RAMPART - SUNRISE
Tamina in her nightgown watches through a loophole as the

army vanishes into the mist On her young face is a vague
sense of the danger she’s just escaped

EXT ALAMUT COURTYARD - LATER THAT DAY

A Persian delegation Tus the twins Dastan and forty
soldiers marches past Alamut soldiers standing at attention

The King of Alamut and his court awaits them on a dais

TUS
(bows formally)
From my father King Shahraman

An ATTENDANT steps forward bearing a chest an INTERPRETER
repeats Tus’s words in Foreign The King responds in kind

As the formalities drag on Dastan slips away from his
brothers As he edges over towards the temple he tries to
catch the eye of

TAMINA resplendent in full regalia standing amongst a group
of Alamut NOBLEWOMEN She notices the young Prince looking
at her he smiles She blushes and turns away giggling
with one of her LADIES-IN-WAITING But she glances back

anyway

On the dais Tus and the King of Alamut embrace in ritual
friendship A murmur runs through the crowd

The Twins lean together for a private aside

FARHAD
I hope he doesn’t make us marry his
daughter

FARHAN

Make you marry her

FARHAD
No you

The sound of a SPLASH and a following commotion turns their
heads The Twins are greatly amused to see that
DASTAN has fallen into
impromptu baptism An
out

Tus shakes his head in
at it again The King

the SACRED FOUNTAIN of ALAMUT An
irritated Alamut Priest helps fish him

embarrassment his younger brother
waves it off indulgently

Dastan emerges dripping wet with a big grin on his face

He looks right at--

TAMINA unable to suppress a smile of amusement and

curiosity

Dastan gets a glimmer in his eyes He winks at her as if
the two of them share a secret

FADE OUT
