EXT A QUIET MORNING (DAWN) - ARDSLEY NEW YORK

March in a quiet commuter suburb Early spring colors gray
air There is no breeze but then one starts It grows
stronger rustling the leaves as we pass through town until
we reach

THE COMFORTABLE HOME OF EDWARD AND CONNIE SUMNER

The wind grows stronger It blows a child’s BICYCLE over
Kid’s toys skitter around the yard
t

INT KITCHEN — MORRINS

playing Game Boy He holds it in the air

His mother CONNIE attractive intelligent 30s makes his
school lunch Its a typical morning pure chaos But Connie
is used to being under siege She gazes out at the trees
bending in the wind

CONNIE

Ignoring her Charlie plays Game Boy He makes wetsounding
shooting and exploding noises Nearby POPPY the dog eats
from its bowl On the kitchen TV a financial channel reports
on the NASDAQ futures

ON PAUL MARTEL 30-ish He is in the middle of the sidewalk
his arms piled with books his chin holding them precariously
in place He watches Connies teetering progress with a kind
of horror The wind hurtles her toward him like a missile He
Gances one way then another trying to get out of her path
but it’s all happening too quickly ‘

toilet Perfect She stares at it then fishes it out dumps
it in the sink washes her hands dries it off and carefully
puts it back in the crowded medicine cabinet

shimmies out of her ripped and bloodstained panty-hose She
puts on her shoes limps to the side of the tub sits wipes
away the new blood and covers the cut with a few Band-Aids

She can see into the window of the car ahead of her The
train goes around a bend and suddenly through that window
she sees Payl Could it be She stares but he doesn’t see
her The train pulls out of the turn She cant seen him any
more

She cranes her head to see whether she can catch sight of
him but just as she does the train turns again and there he
is She waves trying to get his attention He looks up--and
breaks into a grin

Hoisting one leg in the air he points to it and makes a
questioning face How’s the knee She smiles with a nod and
a gesture Not bad Then she points questioningly to her
nose asking hows his He wiggles his nose gives a nod

It’s working okay For a moment they smile at each other not °

sure where this is going And then the train straightens out
and he vanishes

But then he leans back into view and mimes “Call me as
people are getting up around him to get off the train He
waves and goes with them

She sits thinking a smile playing on the corners of her
mouth

watching him i

me twice I‘d be on my back in a second

TRACY
You would not

‘ SALLY
Sure I would Why not

TRACY
A couple of reasons Adam for one
Your kids for another

SALLY
They wouldn’t have to know It would
just be something I did on my own for
myself to broaden my horizons Kind of
like taking a pottery class

TRACY
Having an affair is nothing like taking a
pottery class

SALLY
It could be

TRACY
No Believe me It would start out like
that -- a casual thing that makes life
exciting But then something would
happen -- someone finds out or someone
falls in love -- whatever -- and it would
end disastrously They always end
disastrously

PAUL

CONNIE

He keeps touching her She starts to get heady with arousal
He undoes her skirt

and the rest of the apartment Paul follows him

EDWARD

PAUL
A lot of buying and selling That’s what
I do

As Edward goes around the books the unmade bed comes into
view Edward sees it and stops taken by surprise Paul
sees Edward see it An excruciating moment

Then Edwards eye drifts to the Windy City snow globe sitting
on the nightstand next to the bed He deflates He goes to

Of course it is but it’s too awkward to admit So Paul
doesn’t answer Almost by rote Edward twists something on
the bottom of the globe’s base It plays a tune

PAUL
Oh I didn’t know it did that

Edward sinks onto the bed all the stuffing has been knocked
out of him The tune will continue turning into score and
becoming increasingly jarring as the scene goes on

EDWARD
(quietly to himself)
Why would she do that

PAUL
I don‘t know I guess she wanted to buy
me something

EDWARD
She didn’t buy it for you I gave it to
her

Edward stares at the snow globe in his hand It continues to
snow and play its tune

EDWARD
No --
Suddenly without warning Edward turns and BRINGS THE GLOBE
DOWN WITH GREAT FORCE on Pauls head
f i
For one agonizing moment nothing happens The men stare at
each other There is a look of bewilderment on Pauls face

Then a curtain of blood descends from Pauls head Paul looks
down Blood is dripping on his shoes on the floor
Horrified he puts his hand to his head then looks into his
palm It is red He looks back at Edward then staggers and
falls into a stack of books The books topple and Paul goes
down with them

Blood seeps from his head across the floor staining the
books thrown there Finally it soaks into the “Little Prince”
first edition The original dustjacket turns red

Edward looks at Paul lying there motionless with glazed
open eyes Then at the snow globe His hands shake The
music slows and stops in mid-phrase A few last snowflakes
fall

Edward backs up to a chair He collapses into it staring at
Pauls lifeless body It becomes unbearable to look at He
gets up grabs a sheet from the wall (one of the sculptor’s)
and throws it over Paul He steps back sits back down As
he watches to his horror blood from Pauls face starts to
seep through the sheet Pauls features start to appear
Edward looks away

While he catches his breath we SEE the elevator slowly start
to descend again Edward doesn’t see it threatening to catch
and wedge the end of the rug (and perhaps Paul’s feet) in the
elevator shaft Finally just as the elevator grazes the edge
cf the rug Edward sees it moving He jumps up grabs the
body and pulls it back out into the loft just in time to
keep it from getting lodged in the elevator

off his tie and shirt There’s a manic panic-stricken energy
to what he does He turns on the tap and douses his body
with water cleaning the blood off his chest that has seeped
through his shirt Water splashes onto the floor He dries
himself off with paper towels

As he goes to throw them away he notices the huge trash bin
is chock full of paper towels He starts yanking them out of
the trash They rain around him A seemingly endless
fountain of paper towels spills into the room He grabs his
shirt and the bloody evidence from his coat pocket and shoves
it all into the trash bin then forces the paper towels back
in His breath is coming in short bursts

He takes Jack’s shirt from his other pocket puts it on
buttons it up But the neck is too small It barely closes
The top button pops off He reties his tie Pulls himself
together

He looks at himself in the mirror Inspecting As he pushes
his hair back he notices a small SPOT OF BLOOD on his
forehead He washes it off When it’s all clean and the
evidence is all gone he looks at nimself again And
suddenly as if from nowhere a wave of revulsion overtakes
him and he vomits into the sink

She takes Edward’s hand The hand that killed Paul Absently
she begins softiy rubbing the place where his hand is
scratched He steals a tense glance at her looking for any
sign of suspicion or questioning But her mind is on the
stage He looks Gown at their hands at this tender gesture
of hers

Edward is still sweating With his other hand he pulls out
his handkerchief and mops his forehead Connie looks over at
him

CONNIE (CONT’D)

He nods They both turn back to the play

performing a crudely choreographed number while singing
“Dream Loud“ and signing the lyrics in sign-language On the
lyrics “catch a star from the sky” the children all shoot
their hands in the air

Charlie and ANOTHER BUNNY step forward from the group
(soloists) The hood to Charlies costume is too big its
flopped down over his eyes so he can’t see and the ears are
drooping horizontally

In their seats Connie squeezes Edwards hand Shoots hima
nervous-parent look

That hangs in the air between them awfully They look at
each other in this new horrifying reality Neither one
moves or looks away for the longest time

Until finally her voice practically a whisper

CONNIE
It waS you

He doesn’t answer Which is an answer

CONNIE (CONT‘D)
Oh God Edward Oh my God

Shes horrified repulsed She recoils in horror

Suddenly she turns and staggers for the bathroom We stay on
Edwards face as we hear the toilet seat go up She begins
to vomit As he hears her it all hits him -- the horror of
what he did the magnitude of what he’s lost He completely
falls apart He dissolves in tears

INT SUMNER DEN - NIGHT 215

Connie lies on the couch alone staring at the fire A
blanket is over her This is where she sleeps now But she
can’t sleep at all

A noise -- a sniffle It’s Charlie His pajamas are soaking
wet clinging to him Unnerved by the tension in the house
he’s wet his bed He’s standing there in that dead-tired
half-sleep that children get

CHARLIE
Look what I did

Connie goes to him and hugs him tight

CONNIE
“It’s okay honey It’s okay

She takes him by the hand and heads for the stairs

She turms and sees Edward standing in the hallway leaning
against the wall They look at each other for a moment She
doesn’t leave or send him away So Edward comes closer He

They both just sit there on the floor at the top of the
steirs in the dark

EXT SUMNER HOUSE - DAY Z2i7
A beautiful spring day
INT SUMNER HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - DAY 218

CLOSE ON A STACK OF ONE-HOUR PHOTO PACKETS Among them are
stills of Connie and Charlie reading together from the
videotape that Edward shot the day of the phone call Connie
is at her desk with her back to the room putting these and
other photos into a family photo album

Behind her Edward is playing the piano softly with his back
to her Between them on the floor Charlie is racing
Matchbox cars around a loop-the-loop track he’s set up vroom-
vrooming to himself

OUTSIDE A ARDSLEY POLICE CAR drives by the house Edward
sees it and stops playing Connie hears him stop looks out
the window and sees it too While Charlie continues
Playing they watch the car drive slowly past then away
When the car is out of sight Connie and Edward
simultaneously turn around and look at each other They
share a glance -- of understanding paranoia And the
knowledge that they’re in this together Then Edward goes
back to playing the piano And Connie goes back to sorting
pictures And Charlie continues playing

INT SUMNER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 219

Connie sits down with a sigh Her eyes drift to the snow
globes She takes the Windy City snow globe sits down on the
couch looks at it

Tears spring to her eyes but she doesn’t give way to them
Quickly she wipes them off She twists the key on the
bottom It plays its little tune

Suddenly the tune stops -- but not in the usual way It seems
muffled stuck
LJ

She toys with the key Something shifts The globe’s stand
has separated slightly from the top She never knew it opened
like this She twists the stand away from the top to reveal

edges It had been interfering with the mechanism that plays
the little tune

She opens the envelope Inside is a PHOTOGRAPH she’d long
forgotten Of her and Edward seven years earlier with their
newborn Charlie in her arms

She turns over the picture On the back Edward has written
“My beautiful wife The best part of every day”

She puts the picture back in the envelope She starts to cry
EXT SUMNER BACK YARD DAY 220

A brisk spring day Connie walks down toward the POND at the
bottom of their garden holding the globe and carrying a
manila envelope She stands for a moment looking out at the
still pond Then she takes something out of the manila
envelope lights a match and sets it aflame It’s the
photograph of Connie and Paul leaving the movie theater CU
of Paul’s face curling and burning

She burns the other photographs and negatives Watches them
turn to ash Then she takes the snow globe Looks at it And
decisively throws it far out into the pond

It makes a plopping noise She hears something behind her
She turns Edward is standing there They look at each other
both understanding what she has just done He walks over to
her They stare out at the pond

CONNIE

parents and kids Clutching a Coke he is nodding off

We find Connie and Edward dancing together oblivious to
everyone else They look into each other’s eyes And then
they kiss A deep loving soul kiss It’s the first time
weve seen them really kiss each other And it’s kiss that
lasts that’s full of sorrow and joy and hope and loss and
anger and forgiveness and everything that gets piled into a
love It feels like it could last forever
