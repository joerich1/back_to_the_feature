shoe laces Jane enters

JANE

(she gets down on her
knees)

JOHNNY
I dont need any help I feel fine

But he lets her take off his shoes anyway He suddenly
explodes into an indignant tirade against nothing in
particular

JOHNNY

(waving his arms as

Jane takes off his

shoes)

quiet and what happens Blah-blah-

His face is such a mask of misery she can hardly stand

him tightly

Johnnys head is lowered He doesnt answer

Another seconds pause

Oh Johnny -- you fool What does it

bosom)
Oh Jane -- I let you down Ill

The room presents a sorry contrast to the gay revelry going

on outside There is a distinct aura of let-down and
depression Sitting in an easy chair is Mrs Mason a shawl
over her shoulder sniffing at a tube of benzedrine and quite
miserable from a cold Johnny in evening clothes is sprawled
on a window seat playing with the babys toy cat winding it
up and listening morosely to the music-box tune The only
sound except for what drifts in from the celebration in the
street is the tune from the music-box Janes wrap and
Johnnys overcoat are draped over a chair

a little awkward to have you and
Jane at his engagement party

JOHNNY
(sharply)
Now Mother How could it be awkward

JANE
Awkward or not awkward -- are we
going to sit here all night waiting
for him Lets call him up

Johnny drops the cat to the floor rises and exits to outer

MRS MASON
(almost as if shes

doesnt The orchestra off scene strikes up Auld Lang Syne
he people sing Johnny and Jane holding hands start to
sing with frantic efforts at a gaiety that they try to wring
from their leaden hearts

emotions and she turns and starts away to keep from bursting

Simon the butler comes to the door and opens it a little

wind and rain as the door is shoved open and Johnny forces
his way into the hall He is rain-drenched dishevelled and
almost hysterical with panic

Carter who has been leaning against the wall straightens
up and addresses Doolittle

JUDGE DOOLITTLE

Quiet

JOHNNY

effective immediately

There is a loud knock on the door

JUDGE DOOLITTLE
(frowns and calls out)

CLOSE SHOT - AT DOOR

It opens and John Horace Mason II walks in on his own power
An instant later Jane and Mrs Mason come in bursting with
news

JANE

interrupted anything important --

Johnny comes into scene frowning
JOHNNY

She drops down on her knees by the baby and takes hold of
his shoulders

The men in the office crowd around her
