(proudly dabbing palette)

Prime Minister in almost two hundred
years

He straightens

ARTIST
And I dont mind telling you it
wasnt for Mr Blair

ELIZABETH
Not a moderniser then

ARTIST
Certainly not Were in danger of
losing too much thats good about this
country as it is

TV COMMENTARY
The only questions that still remain
how big will his landslide be And how
extensive how sweeping will the
modernisation programme be that he
ushers in

ELIZABETH
Hmm

The QUEEN watches as he paints

ELIZABETH

I rather envy you being able to vote
(a beat)

Not the actual ticking of the box
although I suppose it would be nice
to experience that ONCE

(a beat)

But the sheer joy of being partial

ARTIST
Yes
The ARTIST squints as he scrutinises the canvass

ARTIST
One forgets that as Sovereign you are
not entitled to vote

ELIZABETH
No

ARTIST
Still you wont catch me feeling
sorry for you You might not be
allowed to vote Maam
(a beat)
But it IS your Government

ELIZABETH
Yes

The QUEEN raises her eyebrow

ELIZABETH
I suppose that is some consolation

The stirring sound of bagpipes

EXT BUCKINGHAM PALACE - INNER COURTYARD - DAY

unchanged since Queen Victoria a uniformed PIPER wearing a
kilt of Ancient Hunting Stuart tartan marches under her
Majestys windows playing the bagpipes

ts her morning alarm call and its the way she wakes up
wherever she is - anywhere in the world

INT BUCKINGHAM PALACE - QUEENS BEDROOM - DAY

can still be heard from below) Her Majestys DRESSER sticks
her head round the corner with a calling tray of Earl Grey
tea and the newspapers

MAID
Gmorning Maam

The DRESSER puts the tea and newspapers on a bedside table

DRESSER
Shall I draw the curtains

The QUEENs sleepy voice answersPlease The DRESSER goes
to the window

ELIZABETH (0S)

And Was it as expected

The QUEENs hand reaches for spectacles then for the
newspapers She puts on her glasses

quite establishment Father a
Conservative A public school
education at Fettes where he was
tutored by the same man as the Prince
of Wales

ELIZABETH
Well well try not to hold that
against him
JANVRIN
On the other his manifesto promises
the most radical modernisation and
shake-up of the Constitution in three
hundred years

ELIZABETH
Oh Is he going to “modernise us do
you think

JANVRIN

I wouldnt put it past him Hes
married to a woman with known anti-
Monarchist sympathies - you may
remember her curtsey the first time
you met It could best be described as
“shallow

ELIZABETH
I dont measure the depth of a
curtsey Robin I leave that to my
sister

JANVRIN

And I spoke to the Cabinet Secretary
who said he was expecting the
atmosphere at Downing Street to be
very informal Everyone on first name
terms

Ss
PENCER (ON TV)
this is not a time for
recriminations however I would say
that I always believed that the press
would kill her in the end
(MORE)

SPENCER (contd)
But even I could not imagine that they
would take such a direct hand in her
death as seems to be the case It
would appear that every proprietor and
editor of every publication that has
paid for intrusive and exploitative
photographs of her has blood on his
hands today

private matter and we would all
appreciate it if it could be respected
as such

I see

TONY straightens taken aback

TONY
I dont suppose anyone has had time to
think about the funeral yet

Weve spoken to the Spencer family
and its their wish
(a beat)
their express wish that it should
be a private funeral With a memorial
service to follow in a month or so

TONY
Right

TONY shoots a look at CHERIE

ELIZABETH
Given that Diana was no longer a
member of the Royal Family we have no
choice but to respect their wishes

I see

TONY shoots a look at CHERIE

TONY
You dont feel that in view of her
high profile and popularity
(

(WE INTERCUT

choosing his words
carefully)
-it might be an idea to pay tribute
to her life and achievements

Or even just to her as a mother

As I said Thats the Spencers wish

You dont think a private funeral

Good afternoon your Majesty Im
sorry to disturb I was just
wondering
NT BALMORAL - QUEENS STUDY - CONTINUOUS

PRINCE PHILIP indicates she should put TONY on speaker-

The QUEEN obliges TONYs voice comes out

TONY
whether youd seen any of todays
papers

The QUEEN looks at her desk Most of the newspapers are
strewn out in front of her

ELIZABETH
Weve managed to look at one or two
yes

TONY

In which case my next question would
be - whether you felt some kind of
response might be necessary

ELIZABETH (contd)
No I believe a few over-eager editors
are doing their best to sell
newspapersand it would be a mistake
to dance to their tune

TONY
Under normal circumstances I would
agree butP
RINCE PHILIP
(under his breath)
Here we go The bloody flag again

ELIZABETH indicates for PHILIP to be quiet
TONY

-my advisers have been taking the
temperature among people on the
streets - and the information Im
getting is that the mood
(choosing words carefully)
is quite delicate

PRINCE PHILIP
(under his breath)

Of course Thats where all the ruddy

cameras are

ELIZABETH gestures again for PHILIP to SSSsshhh

ELIZABETH

So what would you suggest Prime
Minister Some kind of statement

TONY
No Matam I believe the moment for
statements has passed

TONY
I would suggest flying the flag at

half-mast above Buckingham Palace

PRINCE PHILIP almost has an apoplexy

PRINCE PHILIP
See

TONY
And coming down to London at the

PHILIP stares in disbeliefWhat

TONY
It would be a great comfort to your

people and would help them with their

grief

ELIZABETH
THEIR grief

he QUEEN exchanges a look with PHILIP

ELIZABETH
If youre suggesting that I drop
everything and come down to London
before I attend to two boys that have
just lost their motheryoure
mistaken

RINCE PHILIP
Absurd E

ELIZABETH
I doubt there are many who know the
British more than I do Mr Blair nor
who has greater faith in their wisdom
and judgement And it is my belief
that they will soon reject this ‘mood
which has been stirred up by the

pressin favour of a period of
restrained grief and sober private
mourning

His fur is thick His blaze across his nose is distinctive
He is vast almost the size of a horse

nd staring at her The QUEEN stares back

Oh you are a beauty

It is unprecedented - almost supernatural No STAG ever
willingly comes this close to humans

connection between them

Its a magical moment All around them the whistling of

the sound of trees bending Then ever so faintly in the
distance

The hum of approaching engines Its the GILLIES coming to
look for the QUEEN Sensing this

at the QUEEN then briefly inclines his head turns and
walks off

dear

Im referring to your visit to India
and Pakistan where your comments
about ending historic disagreements
went down very well

ilence

And the Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meeting I spoke to the
Prime Minister of Malawi who was
saying how much he appreciated your
tough stance on Nigeria
Silence
TONY
I meant to tell you at the time but
you were being monopolised rather

I imagine those occasions are quite
difficult Twenty-four heads of
Government each clamouring for a
private audience

Silence TONY takes a deep breath then

TONY
Also we havent had a chance to speak
since THAT week And I wanted to offer
my apologies

“managed in any way

The circumstances were exceptional
Maam And in the end you showed
great personal strength courage and
humility E

ELIZABETH
oure confusing humility with
humiliation

Thats not true

ELIZABETH
You didnt hear what they were saying
in the Mall that Friday

TONY
I still believe History will show it
was a good week for you

ELIZABETH
And an even better one for you Mr
Blair

TONY

But there are fifty-two weeks in a
year Maam And two and a half
thousand in a half century

days

You dont feel that what respect or
affection people might once have had
for

diminished

were less fulsome in their support

One or two But as a leader one
hasa different perspective

I could never have added my voice to
the chorus

ELIZABETH
Youre very kind

The QUEEN looks at TONY raises an eyebrow

ELIZABETH
But lets also not forget the more
pragmatic reason

TONY
Which is

ELIZABETH
That without me there to distract
everyone itd suddenly become
embarrassingly clear how much
unchecked power the British Prime

Minister actually has
TONY looks up

ELIZABETH

If fifty years of doing MY job has
taught me anything it is that the
people doing YOURS generally prefer me
with all my faults to some kind of
meddling President

(a beat)
Just look at the French

The QUEEN opens her handbag and takes out her reading
glasses E
ELIZABETH (contd)
I suppose wed better get on with the

rid of me T

TONY
For about half an hour But then you
came down to London and all that went

away

ELIZABETH
Ive never been hated like that

TONY

No And that must have been difficult

They begin walking again

ELIZABETH

Ever since Diana people want glamour
and tearsthe grand performanceand
Im not very good at that I prefer to
keep my feelings to myself Foolishly
I believed thats what people wanted
from their Queen Not to make a fuss
nor wear ones heart on ones sleeve

The QUEEN stops

ELIZABETH
Its how I was brought up Its all
Ive ever known

TONY
One forgets You were so young when

Then pulls herself back
