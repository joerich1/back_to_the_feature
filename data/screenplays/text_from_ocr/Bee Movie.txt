that a bee should be able to fly

The bee of course flies anyway

Mr Ditchwater the way we work may
be a mystery to you because making
honey takes a lot of bees doing a
lot of small jobs But let me tell
you something about a small job
If you do it really well it makes
a big difference More than we
realized To us to everyone
That’s why I want to get bees back
to doing what we do best
