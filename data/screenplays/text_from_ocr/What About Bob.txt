Fat or skinny

BOB
Er skinny I think

ANNA
(warning tone)
Uh oh

BOB
What do you mean

ANNA

Dad saw crayons as phallic symbols
When I asked for skinny crayons it
was a personal assault on his manhood

BOB
Whatd he do buy a Porsche

Anna laughs
ANNA
I wish He just kept psychoanalyzing
everything My dolls were alter egos
Boys who wanted to kiss me were
Oedipally fixated adolescents looking
to displace their mothers on their
aboriginal family totems

BOB
Sounds like my friends to a tee
(a beat)
You seem to be doing okay now

ANNA
Hardly I analyze everything to death
Every time a guy smiles at me I ask
myself is he really smiling or is he
just orally fixated When I smile
back I wonder am I really attracted
or just smiling out of some residual
Cro-Magnon instinct If I ever
actually have sex Im not sure Ill
now the difference between an orgasm
and an anxiety attack

BOB
have the same problem

ANNA
The kinds of urges other girls act
on impulsively I analyze until either
the urge goes away or --

fq

BOB

learned to leave his work at the
office

her

friends then walks towards her father Bob starts
towards

Marvin too

BOB
Did you see me out there Im getting

ANNA
Daddy not here

MARVIN PUPPET
Anna I know you think youre old
enough to know whats best for you
and I know youre at the age where
you dont want to listen to your
father But as your father whos
always loved you Im asking you not
to see Bob Wiley

ANNA PUPPET
I dont understand the problem Bobs
a nice guy

MARVIN PUPPET
Bob Wiley is a patient He followed
me here from New York which is
bizarre But even if it werent
bizarre my daughter seeing a patient
that Im treating is entirely
inappropriate

ANNA PUPPET
Bob said youre not treating him
here

MARVIN PUPPET
Hes right there

ANNA PUPPET
So if youre not treating him while
hes here then hes not a patient
while hes here is he And I have
the right to see him

She throws the puppet at Marvin then runs to her

MARVIN PUPPET
Anna youre acting out

ANNA
Bobs a perfectly nice guy Hes
intense and sensitive and he listens

you Bob

defiantly
Marvin stands a moment and watches He is stunned

JAMESON
(ON PHONE)
Well moneys tight and
MARVIN
Sure
(pause)

Though you know there is another
way to look at it

JAMESON
(ON PHONE)
Whats that

MARVIN
Well if you gave a new toothbrush
and taught dental hygiene to every
student at your school In the
long run youd save them thousands
of dollars I mean look at the cost
of dental bills I bet I could have
put my kids through college with
what Ive spent on fillings

JAMESON
Thats an interesting point

MARVIN
It is isnt it
(pause)

Maybe you should try the toothbrushes

You might do a lot for education by
saving teeth
