FADE IN

INT CASTLEMAN BEDROOM CONNECTICUT -- NIGHT OCTOBER 1992 1

CLOSE ON the rumpled empty half of a bed The bedside table
holds a stack of novels a pair of reading glasses note
pads pencils

All is silent except for the hum of a digital clock We see
the face of the clock click to 245 AM

Then we hear the creak of floor boards and the lumbering
footsteps of a man returning to bed The space in the bed is
filled with the figure of the novelist JOSEPH CASTLEMAN
early 70s He has the anxious exhausted look of someone
who doesnt have a prayer of sleeping Joe is a handsome
aging Brooklyn boy turned literary giant He has the beard
and the bearing of a proper eminence grise but he is also an
unapologetic sensualist He embraces all that life has to
offer with a greedy passionate vigor -- which the critics
tell us is what makes his writing so rich

CRINKLE CRINKLE CRINKLEJoe starts unwrapping a package
of Hostess Snowballs which he’s brought back to bed with him

Next to him JOAN CASTLEMAN his wife of 40 years is on her
side eyes shut but awake trying for sleep Shes five
years his junior -- an elegant educated deeply self-
possessed shiksa from the upper-east side who was bred to be
a muse and helpmate to some brilliant charismatic man

Joe devours the Snowball then brushes the crumbs off and
rearranges his pillows Then he turns on his side and goes

about the business of seducing his wife He searches the
folds of her nightgown for a breast

her hand and places it on his head so she’1ll stroke his hair
She obliges him running her hand through his hair to soothe

him to sleep

JOAN
Gnight Joe

JOE

and limited-edition black and white art photos

Joe’s New York publishing team -- his AGENT EDITOR and
PUBLISHER -- arrive They’ve all come up from Manhattan in
their good suits to lavish Joe with pricey bottles of wine
His agent and editor are younger than Joe -- he’s outlived
the last bunch But his longtime publisher HAL BOWER 70s
is still vital and a dapper dresser He gives his star
writer a bear hug and booms his congratulations

We see a motley collection of Joe’s longtime WRITER FRIENDS
bent over a table of catered food consuming large amounts of
Joes food and liquor to make up for the fact that they
didnt get the Nobel

We see Joan with an icy glass of white wine in her hand
standing with the WRITERS WIVES who have the discarded look
of muses of unsuccessful men

from Joan’s POV through the open door as the TIMES

the stance of a literary giant She turns to go back to the
party but she can’t face the writer’s wives who’ve been
watching her with their sad resentful faces

INT CASTLEMAN HOME KITCHEN -- DAY

wine We see her daughter SUSANNAH a capable young
woman who’s hugely pregnant setting champagne flutes on a
tray

Joe is with Hal and the Times photographer having his photo
session He’s posing next to a wall of book shelves lined
with his prodigious output of the last several decades He’s
holding his first novel THE WALNUT with its 1950’s artfully
simple book sleeve (very Catcher in the Rye)

A clutch of Joe’s GRADUATE STUDENTS from Yale are also there
watching their beloved professor get photographed David
glances at these young acolytes of his father’s feeling just
a tad of resentment

Joe sees David watching him and he raises his eye brows a
bit trying to look bemused for his son’s sake The
photographer takes a rapid series of shots

Joe turns to David

JOE

JOE

No clearly I’m completely
distracted at the moment We’1l

Joe sees Joan coming out of the kitchen with Susannah
carrying a large tray of glasses which are filled with
champagne

David has stubbed out his cigarette and he stands by Joan
who puts her arm around him and gives him a little squeeze
Susannah stands on the other side of Joan and Joan tucks her
hand through her daughter’s arm wanting comfort of her kids
by her side

Joe collecting his thoughts shuts his eyes and waits for
everyone to settle down Once the shushing stops Joe
begins

JOAN

up

HAL

To Joseph Castleman who in my
opinion is the greatest living
author of the twentieth century and
now God dammit the rest of the
world finally knows it

A chorus of “here here’s” and clinking glasses while Joe
waves everyone off Joe slips his arm around Joan and murmurs
into her ear

JOE
Talk to me

JOAN
Blah-blah-blah Darling

DISSOLVE TO

INT CLASSROOM SMITH COLLEGE -- DAY FALL 1956 9

We see YOUNG JOAN 19 a fresh-faced coed in a tartan skirt
and matching blue sweater sitting at a desk with the other
SMITHIES all waspy well-heeled girls like herself While
they wait for the professor to arrive SMITHIE GIRL LORRAINE
who fancies herself a sophisticate is holding court with the
other girls

SMITHIE GIRL LORRAINE
when we were in France this
summer I went off with this boy on
his motocycle He was a diplomat’s
son but Mums and Daddy were still
horrified Gawd when will it end

The door flings open and young Professor Castleman enters
looking handsome and disheveled

YOUNG JOE
Sorry Im late

He drops a pile of books on his desk Even in his distracted
state he has a sexual energy that makes all the young women
sit up

YOUNG JOE (CONTD)
I do have a good excuse however
My wife had a baby last night

The girls react with awwws Except for Lorraine and Joan
whore both studying the professor sizing him up

SMITHIE GIRL LORRAINE
Is it a boy or a girl Professor

YOUNG JOE
A girl Fanny After Fanny Price
THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 17

SMITHIE GIRL LORRAINE
After the Jewish vaudeville
entertainer

Joan cant help herself she quietly corrects the girl

YOUNG JOAN
Thats Fanny Brice Fanny Price is
the character from Mansfield
Park

YOUNG JOE
Thats right Extra credit to the
girl in blue

The other girls look at Joan resentful that she already
scored a point with the professor Joan averts her eyes --
she didnt mean to draw attention to herself

YOUNG JOE (CONTD)
It’s completely pretentious giving
my daughter a literary name But I
want her to know how important
books are And when you girls start
having babies I expect all of you
to name your little girls Fanny
too

There is laughter in the classroom Joan is offended by this
remark and emboldened by the victory of her last remark
speaks up

YOUNG JOAN
I dont intend to have babies until
Im published And maybe not even
then

YOUNG JOE
Very admirable And if any of you
want to write a nice little romance
or a book of love poems there are
plenty of publishers out there who
will gobble you up Youre free to
do that on your own time but if you
bring any of that pap into my
class I will flunk you outright

Joe pulls a walnut out of his jacket pocket He cracks it and
quietly picks out the meat All eyes are on him

YOUNG JOE (CONT’D)
A true writer does not write to get
published He writes because he
has something urgent and personal
that he needs to say He must
write as he must breathe and he
keeps on doing it despite the
loneliness and the poverty and the

YOUNG JOE (CONTD)
piles of rejection slips and the
parent or the wife who cry out
“you fool why don’t you get a real
job” A writer writes because if
he doesn’t his soul will starve

The professor sits back and pops the meat of the walnut into
his mouth allowing his words to sink in Then gazes out of
the window and recites

YOUNG JOE (CONTD)
“His soul swooned slowly as he
heard the snow falling faintly
through the universe and faintly
falling like the descent of their
last end upon all the living and
the dead”

YOUNG JOE (CONTD)
James Joyce No more needs to be
said

The other girls laugh nervously but Young Joan stares at Joe
with a fierce look that catches his eye

INT SMITH COLLEGE HALLWAY -- WINTER 1956 10

Young Joan is anxiously sitting on a bench outside the
professors office She can hear him talking to another
student -- quick dueling murmurs then a shriek of female
laughter

The door opens and SMITHIE GIRL LORRAINE comes out still
laughing and aglow from her meeting with the professor She
glances at Joan gives her a smug little smile Joan watches
her rival walk down the hall certain that this girl now owns
the professor heart and soul

YOUNG JOE
Hello Miss Archer

Young Joan startles looks up at Professor Castleman whos
standing at his office door watching her intently

YOUNG JOE (CONTD)
Please come in
INT PROFESSOR CASTLEMANS OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS DAY 1956 11
Young Joan is now sitting across from Young Joe at his desk

which is littered with walnut shells Joe has opened up a
folder of neatly typed pages
THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 19

YOUNG JOE
So Your story Ive read this
twice and frankly both times Ive
found it to be quite good

Joan blushes is overwhelmed with gratitude

YOUNG JOAN
Thank you Professor

YOUNG JOE
However know that you still have a
long way to go with this piece

YOUNG JOAN
Yes yes of course Im more than
willing to make fixes

YOUNG JOE
Im not asking you to fix
anything Im asking you to go
deeper You write with a lot of
intelligence but youre detached

YOUNG JOAN
Oh But the characters are supposed
to be detached Especially the
mother

YOUNG JOE
But she wasnt always that way was
she She was somebodys child once
somebodys lover She has
cravings and fears and secret
desires Im sure she even passes
gas

YOUNG JOAN
Yes she does But she blames it
on the negro maid

YOUNG JOE
(laughs )
Very good I see Im going to have
to watch out for you

Young Joan forces a laugh wanting to sound like Smithie girl
Lorraine

YOUNG JOAN
Oh I can be quite a handful
Professor

Joe looks at her kindly

YOUNG JOE
Do me a favor Miss Archer dont
try to put it on like the others
(MORE)

THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 20

YOUNG JOE (CONTD)
Youre charming enough just the way
you are

YOUNG JOAN
(blushing wildly)
Yesall right

YOUNG JOE
Good girl

Joe cracks a walnut and offers her some from the palm of his
hand Joan hesitates then takes some but still doing her
best to pick up the nut without touching his skin

Joe smiles finds this extremely endearing He leans into
Joan his voice confidential

YOUNG JOE (CONTD)
Miss Archer I want to ask you
something I was wondering
whether by any chance you would be
free Saturday night

Joan is breathless Is he asking her out

YOUNG JOAN
Yes Yes I am

YOUNG JOE
Good Would you be interested in
baby-sitting My wife and I
havent gotten out since Fanny was
born

YOUNG JOAN
(a beat)
Sure
(flatly)
I love babies

EXT PROFESSOR CASTLEMANS HOUSE -- NIGHT 12

Joan is standing in the freezing cold on the porch of a
modest salt box house on faculty row She can hear Joe and
his wife Carol yelling at each other from different parts of
the house

CAROL (0S)
Joe dammit I asked you to heat
her bottle

JOE (0S)
I did

CAROL (0S)
When It’s ice cold

THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 21

JOE (0S)
I don’t know when I did it I did
it when you told me to do it

Joan rings the bell which gives a half-hearted BLAT
Joe opens the door looking distracted his shirt half
buttoned and his face still raw from shaving We hear the
baby crying It’s a messy house -- Carol is not a great
housekeeper

YOUNG JOE

Come in come in Im warning you
its chaos in here

INT PROFESSOR CASTLEMANS HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS NIGHT

As Joan steps inside CAROL CASTLEMAN calls from upstairs

CAROL (0S)
Is that the girl

YOUNG JOE
Yes Her name is Joan

Carol appears at the top of the stairs Shes small and
frazzled a young woman who already looks middle-aged

CAROL
(to Joan)
Hello The babys up here

Joan looks at Joe

YOUNG JOE
Go on up Carol could you get me
my tie

CAROL

Its on the bed

YOUNG JOE
Yes I know that can you get it
for me please

Carol makes an impatient sound As Joan starts up the narrow

stairs we see Carol appear again with the tie and toss it
down to Joe It falls short and Joan picks it up and holds

it

out to Joe To her surprise he grabs her hand and murmurs

into her ear

YOUNG JOE (CONTD)
This is my life God help me

INT PROFESSOR CASTLEMANS HOUSE UPSTAIRS BEDROOM -- LATERA
NIGHT

Joan is now pacing the Castlemans bedroom with the BABY
whos slung over her shoulder in a pool of drool While
shes waiting for the kid to doze off she decides to take a
little tour of the Castlemans things She opens the closet
and peers at Joes shirts and jackets She touches his
clothes briefly careful not to disturb them She closes
the closet and wanders over to the bedside table

She puts the baby down on the bed and picks up a book --
James Joyces Ulysses

She opens it up and sees Joes name written inside the fly
leaf Its a bold sexy important-looking signature She
runs her fingers over it her heart racing She carefully
replaces the book next to some walnut shells littering the
top of the table She sees a small piece of walnut meat

that the Professor must have missed She picks it up and

puts it in her mouth

She looks down at the baby whos staring up at her in that
dumb unfocused baby way

JOAN
Hello you Im falling in love
with your Daddy

Feeling reckless she opens the drawer of the bedside table
and looks in Theres a plastic diaphragm case and a tube of
spermicide Joan stares at it horrified and fascinated
Next to the diaphragm is a whole walnut with something penned
on it in Joes distinctive script

Joan picks it up To Carol I love you true J Joan
touches the glossy lips of the nutshes surprised by how
sensuous a walnut can be So this is why Joe likes to eat
them

INT PROFESSOR CASTLEMANS OFFICE -- A WEEK LATER DAY 15

Young Joan is seated across from Professor Castleman whos
slowly rolling a walnut around in one hand while he leafs
through Joan’s latest literary effort Joan is in agony
praying that she hasnt gone too far

YOUNG JOE
So The Faculty Wife Youve shed
quite an interesting light on Mrs
Castleman

YOUNG JOAN
No no its not about your wife at
all it was just a character study

THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 23

Joe leans over and kisses Joan full on the lips He finally
releases her and Joan sits back in her chair flushed and
trembling

YOUNG JOE
Miss Archer Ive already told you
that your work is good But Im
not sure that I got it through to
you Do you believe me now

YOUNG JOAN
Yes I think youve made it
perfectly clear

They continue to kiss In their passion they knock Joans
manuscript off the desk and the pages flutter to the floor

INT CONCORD JET -- SOMEWHERE BETWEEN NIGHT AND DAY 1992 16

Were mid-flight on the way to Stockholm We see Joan and Joe
ensconced in their fancy Concord seats In the seats behind
them we see Joe’s entourage -- his publisher agent and
editor And David who’s curled up in a blanket plugged into
a Walkman

Joan is doing the New York Times crossword puzzle -- with a
pen of course Joe in a nest of airline blankets and
pillows and newspapers his free sleep mask dangling around
his neck is busy writing down ideas for his next novel ona
yellow pad His tray table is littered with the remains of
all the in-flight offerings of drinks and nut cups and jumbo
shrimp

A comely FLIGHT ATTENDANT MONICA comes over to Joe and ina
hushed tone leans over Joan and offers him a basket of
freshly-baked cookies

FLIGHT ATTENDANT MONICA
Would you like a freshly baked
cookie Mr Castleman

Joe looks up at the lovely Monica whos hovering over him

JOE
Yes Why not

As the attendant leans over Joe and delivers his cookie with
a pair of tongs Joe watches with quiet pleasure as her
breasts slide forward inside the silky blouse of her uniform

detachment
THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 24

FLIGHT ATTENDANT MONICA
(To Joan)
Mrs Castleman would you like a
cookie

Joan would dearly love to strangle the bitch But her reply
is faultlessly polite

JOAN
Thank you no

The lovely Monica moves on Joe is aware of Joans
annoyance

JOE

You want a bite of my cookie
JOAN

No
JOE

You want one of my pillows

JOAN
No thank you

Joe holds his yellow pad up to her with his list of notes

JOE
You want to take a look at this

JOAN
Id like to do my crossword

Joan goes back to her crossword Joe squeezes her knee and
goes back to his notes

Theyre interrupted again by flight attendant Monica

FLIGHT ATTENDANT MONICA
Excuse me Mr Castleman theres a
gentleman in back who says he knows
you and would like to say hello
Nathanial Bone

JOE
Oh Christ

JOAN
(to the flight attendant)
Tell him that Mr Castleman is
asleep

Joe starts fumbling with his sleep mask

NATHANIAL BONE comes up from the rear if the plane Hes a
tall boyish man in his late 30s with a mop of hair and
THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 25

stylish horn-rimmed glasses He affects a self-deprecating
manner that Joe finds unbearable

BONE
Sorry to interrupt but I just
wanted to say congratulations

JOE
Hello Nathanial So I take it
youre not flying to Stockholm just
for the pickled herring

BONE
No I wouldn’t miss your award for
anything This is just an
astounding achievement Joe

JOE
Its not about the prize its
about getting up the gumption to
write the next book

BONE
Absolutely Thats why you are who
you are And Joan congratulations
to you as well I dont think
anyone gives enough credit to the
spouse

JOE
I give my wife credit I give her
plenty of credit

BONE
I meant the rest of the world The
critics and the readers and
especially us pesky biographers

JOE
Listen my friend I know Im
supposed to be impressed that
youve somehow wheedled your way
onto this plane but Im still not
letting you write my biography

BONE
Yes youve always made that very
clear

JOE
Good

Joe moves his sleep mask over his eyes making it clear that
hes done with Bone

JOAN
Thank you for saying hello
Nathanial
THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 26

BONE
Well again congratulations To
both of you I truly mean it

As Bone turns to go back to his row he pauses at Davids
seat

BONE (CONTD)
Hey David hows the writing going

David roused from his head set looks up at Bone with a
vague stare

BONE (CONTD)
Nathanial Bone

JOE
Move on Nathanial

Bone leaves

JOE (CONTD)

Schmuck
JOAN
You were rude
JOE
I have to be blunt or he wont give
up
JOAN

You dont want to make enemies with
someone like that Theres nothing
more dangerous than a writer with
hurt feelings

JOE
Hes the one who intruded on my
space Fuck him if he cant take a
perfectly justified rejection

JOAN
I’m just making an observation

JOE
Noted

Joe settles back for a nap
JOAN
Dont forget to stretch your legs

INT GRAND HOTEL -- DAY 17
The Castlemans and Joe’s entourage -- his editor publisher
and agent -- are arriving in the lobby of the Grand Hotel a

19th century edifice of luxury and importance

The DOOR MEN are bowing their heads to Joe BELL MEN are
scurrying to fetch the Castlemans’ luggage HOTEL STAFF smile
at him eyes shining with awe

Joe a little rumpled and travel-worn from the plane flight
stares at the phalanx of SWEDISH PRESS and the members of the
NOBEL PRIZE COMMITTEE who are waiting for him up ahead Joan
squeezes his arm

JOAN
Are you OK

JOE
Yeah thanks Joanie Im fine

Joe walks into the embrace of the adoring Swedes and
reinvigorated by the attention starts pumping hands with
members of the prize committee

Joan stands back with David and shifts Joes heavy woolen
coat to her other arm She adjusts her expression to one of
self-assured repose as they wait for the initial flush of
Castlemania to die down

JOAN
Do you want to know a secret
Honey

DAVID
What

JOAN

I’m dying for a cigarette
David laughs which pleases Joan

We see Nathanial walking by lugging his suitcase and a
plastic bag with his rented tux He spots Joan and David

BONE
Joan Mrs Castleman -- Im sorry
if I intruded on you and Joe I
didnt mean to make myself a pest

JOAN
Well I apologize for my husbands
rudeness

BONE

Please no need I’m sure he’s
been swamped by glad-handers
THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 28

The crowd around Joe is growing larger

BONE (CONTD)

Would you like me to say something

amusing while youre waiting so you
look like youre having a wonderful
time

JOAN

comfortable standing here in my own
thoughts

Joe seeing Bone with Joan and David calls them over

JOE

Joan is swept into Joe’s magic circle The head of the Nobel
committee Arvid ENGDAHL an effusive pink-cheeked man
shakes Joan’s hand

ARVID ENGDAHL
Mrs Castleman Hello I am Arvid
Engdahl I am the one who called
you about the prize waking you up
at such an ungodly hour

JOAN

years to my husbands life

Laughter from the Swedes delighted that their laureate’s
wife is such a warm and witty lady

Arvid turns to the press people

ARVID ENGDAHL
(in Swedish)

The photographers politely nod to her and take a few pictures
for their B rolls

ARVID ENGDAHL (CONT’D)

Joe is watching LINNEA 30s a stunning young woman who’s
been taking his photo As she pauses to adjust her aperture
she studies him with her with her fiercely intelligent eyes
Joe already intrigued nods to her and she smiles back -- an
exchange not lost on Joan

He turns to David who’s lingering on the edge of the crowd
smoking a cigarette

JOE (CONTD)
David Come over here
(to Arvid)
This is our son David

David ambles over and shifts his cigarette so he can shake
Arvid’s hand Joe gives David a look to lose the goddamn
cigarette

ARVID ENGDAHL

pleased to have the children of our
laureates In fact we have found

with the toiletries Joe follows her in and starts examining
the complimentary toiletries set out on the marble counter
while Joan unpacks their things

street She stops at the bottom of the stairway where
there’s a grimy mirror She stops and takes a look at
herself she’s wearing one of her nice traveling outfits and
a pair of white ladylike gloves and she has to admit that she
does indeed look like a nice ex-debutante This infuriates
her She peels off her gloves and flings them to the floor
then marches back up the stairs dragging her suitcase

few scribbles on it and he’s staring at the empty page in his
typewriter his heart too broken to write

Joe turns and looks at her with his beautiful haunted eyes

YOUNG JOE
Youre back

YOUNG JOAN

I believe in you with all my heart

Joe looks like hes going to weep Joan goes to him and he
pulls her onto his lap and buries his face in her neck

They kiss madly and pull each other to the bed

INT CASTLEMAN SUITE GRAND HOTEL -- NEXT MORNING 23A

We see Joe and Joan buried under the giant eiderdown fast
asleep We hear the gentle rustle of the drapes being pulled
open A cool light pours over them More rustling soft
footsteps whispersand suddenly we hear a chorus of girls
break into song

Joe and Joan lurch out of their deep travelers sleep and
stare groggily up at a circle of angelic-looking SWEDISH
GIRLS in white robes who are standing around their bed
holding candles and singing some indecipherable Swedish song
of celebration

Joan and Joe disoriented sit up and groggily stare at the
crowd in their room Walter is standing by

WALTER

Were at a formal reception thats set up with a vast buffet
of food and SERVERS circulating with trays of champagne

Joe with a plate of food in his hands is regaling a group
of NOTABLE SWEDES with one of his standard anecdotes

JOE
-emy father was a shoe salesman
He died of a heart attack when I
was seven while he was fitting some
pimply kid with a pair of saddle
shoes

Walter is rapidly translating this for the non-English
speakers while Linnea takes pictures of Joe

Joan is standing next to David with a glass of champagne
grateful to have her son for company

JOE (CONTD)
So when I come home from school
that day my mother grabs me
presses me to her substantial bosom
and says Joe I have something
terrible to tell you Before she
can get it out my tiny Russian
grandmother whos built like a
footstool screams at her not
before dinner youll ruin his
appetite

The English speakers laugh While Walter translates for the
rest of the Swedes Joe bites into a piece of bread that’s
piled with herring He glances at Joan and she discreetly
signals for him to brush off a crumb from his beard He does
so and Joan gives him a little nod that it’s gone

DAVID
Have you ever thought of letting
him leave in the crumbs

JOAN
Married people don’t do that
Darling Our job is to protect each
other from humiliation

Open it up

Joan opens the book and the spine gives off a stiff crack

ELAINE MOZELL (CONT’D)
You hear that Thats the sound of
a book thats never been opened
Dont ever think you can get their
attention

YOUNG JOAN
Whose

ELAINE MOZELL
The men who write the reviews who
run the publishing houses who edit
the magazines the ones who decide
who gets to be taken seriously who
gets to be put up on the pedestal
for the rest of their lives Who
gets to be King Shit

YOUNG JOAN
But a writer has to write

ELAINE MOZELL
A writer has to be read Honey

Elaine sets her empty drink on the book shelf and walks off
leaving Young Joan crushed She reaches up and touches the
spines of all those tragically unopened books

INT WAVERLY ARMS JOE and JOANS ROOM -- SUMMER MORNING 1928
Young Joe is banging away at his typewriter

Joan dressed for her secretarial job is finishing hanging
some laundry She grabs her purse and coat and gives Joe a
passionate kiss goodbye

INT BOWER and LEEDS PUBLISHING -- DAY SUMMER 1958 29

Young Joan is carrying in a tray of coffee into the office
conference room She passes by another SECRETARY an older
woman who’s carrying out the remains of the men’s lunch
Neither of them look at each other as they’re only there to
serve the men in the room
THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 49

We see the publisher Hal Bower who’s now in his 40’s (we saw
him in his 70’s at the top of the film) having a meeting with
his editors WHITE and LOVEJOY who are all pitching him
manuscripts

LOVEJOY
I have a writer who I think is
the next Henry Miller Hes a
hopeless drunk and will probably
self-destruct in a few years so I
suggest we grab him now

HAL
All right Ill give it a read

Lovejoy holds his coffee cup up to Joan

LOVEJOY
Honey top me off will you

WHITE
I have a novel here by a lady
writer Its about an American
family that spans three
generations It’s great writing
kind of brilliant in parts But I
thought it was a little soft

HAL
Soft

WHITE
It’s from the point of view of this
woman I don’t know just didn’t

grab me

LOVEJOY
Is she good-looking

WHITE
So-so

HAL

How about Jewish writers Anyone
have any smart young Jewish
writers All the big houses have
one Where the hell is ours

CLOSE ON Joan taking this in She screws up her courage and
addresses this room of men with as much authority that she
can muster

YOUNG JOAN
Mr Bower

HAL
Hmm

looking for

INT WAVERLY ARMS JOE and JOANS ROOM -- EARLY EVENING WINTER

Joan flings the door open to their sad little room
breathless Joe is cooking soup for their dinner on a hot
plate He looks at Joan afraid to ask

YOUNG JOE
So what did he say
YOUNG JOAN
Oh Joe he loves it
YOUNG JOE
They want to publish it
YOUNG JOAN
Yes
YOUNG JOE

C’mere C’mere you
Joe takes Joan’s face in his hands and kisses her

Then they both start screaming for joy Joe pulls Joan up on
the bed and they start jumping up and down -- the origin of
this ritual

INT CASTLEMAN SUITE GRAND HOTEL -- LATER NIGHT 31

Joan lying deep in the folds of the eiderdown wakes up with
a gasp from some unpleasant dream She turns over to Joes
side of the bed and sees that he’s not there She looks at
the clock on the bedside table It’s 115 AM

INT GRAND HOTEL DINING ROOM -- NIGHT 32

Joe is sitting alone at a table lit by a candelabra in the
middle of the darkened dining room having a late-night snack
of dense Swedish bread and fat-laden spreads

He looks up and sees Linnea across the dining room taking his
picture She lowers the camera and comes towards him
looking like a Nordic sylph in this light
THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 51

LINNEA
What a beautiful shot The
candlesit’s marvelous like a
Carravagio

JOE
Would you like to join me

LINNEA
No I must go home to bed

JOE

Is it still snowing out there
LINNEA

Yes
JOE

Then I’1l send you out with this
“His soul swooned slowly as he
heard the snow falling faintly
through the universe and faintly
falling like the descent of their
last end upon all the living and
the dead

LINNEA
How beautiful Did you write that

Joe gives her a pained smile and shakes his head no

Linnea sees Joan standing in the doorway wearing her coat
over her nightgown She’s come down from the room looking
for him and has been listening to this exchange

LINNEA (CONTD)
(getting up)
It is time for bed God natt sov
gott Good night sleep well

JOAN
Yes good night

Linnea leaves
Joe starts buttering a piece of bread
JOE
I know you’re going to tell me I’m
going to kill myself eating all
this fat

JOAN
Yes you will

Joan sits down at the table and stares at her husband through
the candlelight

THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 52

What is we blow this whole thing
off What if we go hole up in some
cabin on a fiord We can drink
ourselves silly and howl at the
northern lights

INT CASTLEMAN SUITE GRAND HOTEL -- NEXT DAY 33

Joan up and dressed for the day is sitting in an arm chair
staring at Joe who’s fast asleep under the eiderdown Her
face is unreadable

There’s a knock on the door She gets up and goes down the
hall and lets in the ROOM SERVICE SERVER who’s pushing a cart
elegantly set with breakfast

JOAN
Mr Castleman will have that in the
library thank you

We FOLLOW Joan back to the bedroom where she gives Joe a
little shake

JOAN (CONT’D)

better mood if you let me go

JOE
I just thought this was something
we should be doing together

Joan sets down Joe’s heart pills

JOAN
You need to take one of these at
three I’m setting the alarm on
your watch

Joan puts Joe’s watch back on his bedside table and leaves

INT GRAND HOTEL -- DAY 34

Joan freed of Joe’s celebrity is taking her own sweet time

walking through the lobby No one is bowing and scraping no
one is taking pictures no one is hovering with awe in their

eyes

Joan turns and sees Nathanial getting up from one of the
elegant sitting areas He has a newspaper tucked under his
arm

JOAN
Nathanial

BONE
I’m not stalking you I promise
But I have something for you -- I
was going to leave it for you at
the desk

Bone pulls out an envelope and hands it to Joan
BONE (CONT’D)

I found it at a bookstore at Smith
when I was doing research on Joe

THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 54

Joan pulls out a hand-tinted post card circa 1927 of some
young college women doing a skit the caption Northrop House
Follies Smith College

JOAN
Oh Northrop House That was my
dorm

BONE

I know The pictures a bit before
your time but I thought youd get
a kick out of it

Joan is impressed by the gift but doesnt entirely trust
Bone

JOAN
Thank you Nathanial this was very
thoughtful

BONE
Well youve always been very kind
to me during my aborted attempts to
woo Joe Listen there’s a great
bar here very nineteenth century
You can imagine Strinberg getting
hammered there Can I buy you a
drink

JOAN
Oh I dont know how appropriate
that would be

BONE
It’s completely inappropriate But
were in Sweden in the dead of
winter and I don’t think either of
us should be left alone to our own
brooding thoughts do you

Bone is actually flirting with her Joan finds it rather
enjoyable Joe would be appalled And that’s why she
says

JOAN
One drink No more
INT THE GOLDEN ONION -- DAY 35
Joan and Bone are now sitting in a quaint wood panelled

tavern Its a cozy intimate place good for losing ones
sobriety Theyre both having icy vodka-based drinks
THE WIFE

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT BONE
listen I want you to know that
I’ve gotten an offer to write a
book about Joe I wanted to tell
you so you don’t think I’m doing
anything behind his back

JOAN
And is this going to be a scholarly
work

BONE
Yes and no

JOAN
Meaning what

BONE
Please dont take offense but you
might as well know that Im aware
of Joes various indiscretions

JOAN
(unruffled)
Im sure you are I imagine its
all very juicy material for a
biographer

BONE
To be honest its a little
predictable Most of your men
of genius seem to have overactive
libidos And thanks to the
worshipful tomes put out by us
biographers were supposed to find
it all very charming and
forgivable I dont actually
I think that kind of behavior is
rather appalling

JOAN
Please dont paint me as a victim
Im much more interesting than
that

BONE
Oh I know you are Look I don’t
want to make the wrong assumptions
about your relationship So why
dont you set me straight

JOAN
Oh Nathanial youre so trans-—
parent I cant believe I let you
lure me here

THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 56

BONE
Of course youre free to get up and
leave this cozy cafe and these
excellent drinks and spend the rest
of the afternoon in some drafty
museum of obscure Nordic art

Joan takes a careful sip of her drink

JOAN
All right You have an hour with
me

BONE

Thank you Joan I really do
appreciate this And if theres
anything you dont want to talk
about feel free to tell me to fuck
off

JOAN
Oh dont worry I will

up for the broadcast

James Finch and the other LAUREATES are gathered on stage for
a rehearsal They’re all chatting amicably among themselves

sidelines watching them in delight

Joe arrives with Walter in tow

WALTER
Mister Castleman let me introduce
you to your fellow laureates

metthis is Professor Chen Ling
who’s receiving the prize in
chemistryDoctor Karl Seigler
our esteemed laureate in
medicineand Sir Randall Meade
who’s receiving the prize in
economics
THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 57

Joe intimidated by all this brilliance is grinning and
hunting around for something pithy to say

JOE
Well to quote Groucho Marx “I
never want to be a member of a club
that would have me” However with
this crowd I’d be an idiot not to
make an exception

Hearty laughter from the great men

Linnea is there with her camera She takes a few quick shots
to capture this moment then gives Joe a wink

WALTER
I will turn you over to Mr
Lagerfelt who will instruct you on
the protocol for tomorrow’s
ceremony

The impeccable MR LAGERFELT steps forward

MR LAGERFELT
Gentlemen you will be entering
from this side of the stage in
this order Sir Meade Professor

Ling and Doctor Seigler You will
take your seats here indicated

from your seat to here And you
will receive your medal from the
King

Mr Lagerfelt demonstrates with an OLDER GENTLEMAN who’s
standing in for the king and gives him the medal box

MR LAGERFELT (CONT’D)
You shall then bow making the
three reverences Like so We will
start with you Mr Castleman

Joe feeling the other laureates’ eyes on him can’t focus

JOE
I’m sorry -- do I bow first

MR LAGERFELT
You approach the king and then you
bow

JOE
Ah -- sorry
THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 58

MR LAGERFELT
No need to apologize That is why
we are practicing

JAMES FINCH
It’s not rocket science Castleman

The other laureates chuckle good-naturedly but Joe grimaces a
bit He approaches the gentleman playing the king who hands
him a stand-in for the box with the Nobel medal Linnea is
clicking away her camera feeling a little too close

MR LAGERFELT
And now the three reverences

Joe awkwardly bows in the three directions as Linnea
continues to take her shots -- clickclickclick

MR LAGERFELT (CONT’D)
Very good Mr Castleman you may
now return to your seat

Joe is sweating

JOE
If you’ll excuse me for a moment
WALTER
(hovering)
Are you feeling all right Mr
Castleman
JOE
I just need to take a break excuse
me
WALTER
Can I bring you some water
JOE
I’m fine I’m fine Thank you

Carry on

Joe walks off the stage

37 INT GOLDEN ONION -- DAY 37

Bone is getting out his cigarettes -- foreign of course He
offers one to Joan

BONE
Do you smoke

JOAN
Not officially
THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 59

BONE
I would guess that Joe made you
give it up

JOAN
Yes he wants to keep me healthy

Joan takes a cigarette Bone lights it for her There’s a
hint of seduction in the gesture

Bone pulls out a notebook

BONE
May I
JOAN
Go ahead
BONE
First fascinating query -- this is

the publishers not mine What
does the Nobel Prize mean to Joseph
Castleman

JOAN
Oh God

BONE
What if I just quote what he said
to me on the plane its not about
the prize its about getting up
the gumption to write the next
book

JOAN
Perfect Thank you

BONE
And what about you How do you get
up the gumption

JOAN

To get up in the morning
BONE

To write
JOAN

Im not a writer Nathanial

BONE

I beg to differ When I was
looking through the Smith archives
I found some of your stories that
were published in the college
journal I read The Faculty
Wife It’s a beautifully written
piece

THE WIFE

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT JOAN
Thank you but the fact is I had
potential and nothing more

BONE
And you dont regret giving it up

JOAN
No I had very low expectations of
what I could accomplish as a female
writer

BONE
But there were plenty of successful
women writers back then

JOAN
A few But I didn’t have the right
personality for it

BONE
Really

JOAN
I’m quite shy I don’t like to be
looked at

BONE
All right I won’t look at you

JOAN
How kind

Joan takes a sip of her drink

JOE
Did Joe encourage you to keep
writing

JOAN
Yes but as I said I didnt choose
to pursue it

BONE
Because he was the writer of the
family

JOAN
Now Nathanial if you’re trolling
for nuggets of bitterness you’11l
find none here

BONE
Speaking of bitterness Ive talked
to his ex Carol

JOAN
How is she doing

THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 61

BONE
Shes a psychiatrist

JOAN
Oh Good for her And their
daughter Fanny

BONE
Shes a dentist Carol forgives
you by the way

JOAN
Im glad Joe tried to keep in
contact with themI urged him to
We both feel very badly about that
chapter of our lives

BONE
She said to thank you for taking
him off her hands

JOAN
She’s welcome

Joan takes a drag of her cigarette taps the ash Bone is
watching her

BONE
I hope you know that Joe’s affairs
don’t have anything to do with you
It’s a compulsion I believe it’s
a part of his deep-seated fear of
inadequacy

JOAN
Well arent you the therapist

BONE
Do you have anyone that you confide
in

JOAN
No But I dont really care to

BONE
And thats what makes you so
attractive Your mystery

JOAN
My God Nathanial are you flirting
with me

BONE

Oh probably Why not

JOAN
You know I dont trust you
THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 62

BONE
Of course you dont Im a writer
on a deadline why should you

The waiter comes by and sets down a little plate of Swedish
meatballs

BONE (CONTD)
Would you like another drink

JOAN
One is my limit thank you

BONE
Oh come on I’m having another

JOAN
No Nathanial

Nathanial signals to the waiter to bring two more

INT STOCKHOLM CONCERT HALL CHAMBER ROOM-- DAY 38

Joe has wandered into a formal re-carpeted chamber that is
surrounded on all sides by doors and mirrors He looks
around it disorientated

LINNEA (0S)
Mr Castleman

Joe turns and sees Linnea She holds her hands up to show
that she doesn’t have her cameras with her

LINNEA (CONT’D)
I come to you unarmed I could see
that I was getting on your nerves
All that clicking in your face I
do apologize

JOE
No apologies necessary it’s your
job

LINNEA

They told me that if you wish they
will release you for the day

JOE
I wish that yes
(looking at all the doors)
Which one of these offers the
quickest escape

LINNEA
Shall we try them and see There
my be a secret passageway
THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 63
JOE
Or a dead end

LINNEA
We must choose carefully

JOE
Indeed

They stand there together playing this little game the
sexual tension between them palpable

LINNEA

May I confess something
JOE

Go ahead
LINNEA

I am usually very objective about
my subjects But you move me
Very much

JOE
Do I

LINNEA
You have a wonderful face

Linnea cups Joe’s head in her hands and peers into his face
eyes shining She touches his strong high brow the lines
on his forehead evidence of all that genius

LINNEA (CONTD)
Your mindwhere does it all come
from

Joe can see that she wants to be kissed How can he resist
her luscious young lips or the comforting territory of a
young acolyte’s ass BEE-BEE BEE-BEE The alarm on Joes
watch has gone off

JOE
Oh shit

He starts fiddling with his watch trying to turn it off

JOE (CONTD)
Shit My pills

LINNEA
Your pills

JOE
For my blood pressure
THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 64

LINNEA
Do you need to take them

JOE
I think I should head back to the
hotel

LINNEA

Yes all right

Joe is dying He wants to get out of there He pulls a
walnut out of his pocket and offers it up to her

JOE
Here --

Joe gets out a pen and starts writing on it

JOE (CONTD)
To Linnea -- thats L-I-N-E-A

LINNEA
No two Ns

JOE
Two Ns

Joe tries to rub the letters out

LINNEA
That’s all right -- I should go Do
you know the way out

JOE
Yes I’m fine Go ahead

Linnea makes a hasty exit leaving Joe holding the walnut
feeling like an utter fool

JOE (CONTD)
Aw shit

39 INT THE GOLDEN ONION -- DAY 39

Joan has made a healthy dent in her second drink She and
Bone are lighting up another cigarette

BONE
You know Im curious about
something Off the record

JOAN
Off the record -- we’ve all heard
that one before

BONE
On my honor
THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 65

Bone puts his note pad down

BONE (CONTD)
Ive read some of Joes early work -
- some short stories I dug up ina
couple of obscure literary
journals I hate to say it but
they werent so great

JOAN
Early work is rarely very readable
I think you know that

BONE
But there isnt even a hint of his
mature voice In fact your piece
The Faculty Wife reads more like
early Castleman than these do

JOAN
That doesn’t surprise me Joe had
a very heavy hand as a teacher

BONE
Fair enough but when I talked to
Carol she said it was odd how his
writing got so much better after he
met you

JOAN
That’s very generous of her

BONE
With all respect I think youre
tired of his affairs tired of
being invisible tired of putting
your enormous talent into creating
the Castleman legend And for the
health of your family this might
be something youd want to do
David seems like a very unhappy
young man

JOAN
You have no business talking about
my children

BONE

No you’re right I apologize

(gently)
I think you really do want to talk
And I give you my word Ill never
reveal my source I’1ll be the bad
guy so you don’t have to feel like
youre betraying Joe The truth
will be out and then youd be free
to write on your own

THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 66

JOAN
What a marvelous story Nathaniel
You really ought to write fiction

Joan gets up

BONE
You know where to find me And
Joan I want you to know -- I

really do enjoy your company
Joan gives Bone one of her gracious elusive smiles and she
leaves him there to stew over his drink

We see Young Joan sitting at her large wrap-around desk in
front of a typewriter while Young Joe stands behind her
massaging her shoulders The two of them are looking down at
her pages that Joe has marked up with red pencil
THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 84

YOUNG JOE
This part where you describe her
folding his clothes it goes on too
long

The office door opens and THREE-YEAR-OLD DAVID slips in
carrying a little stuffed giraffe

YOUNG JOAN
It’s deliberate Joe It’s about
her boredom while she’s waiting for
him to show up

David goes over to Joan and leans against her and starts
bouncing the giraffe around her desk

YOUNG JOAN (CONTD)
There’s a rhythm to it Do you see
It’s an endless list of the
prosaic

YOUNG JOE
I see it It’s good If that’s
what you’re doing you need to take

MELINDA a young woman who’s not beautiful but pleasant
enough that Joe might feel compelled to seduce her He shuts

fade as he’s being led away She stares at the closed door

for a beat -- was that my child crying Joan returns to her

DR EKEBERG (VO)
Mr Castleman you have given us a
vast restless and brilliant body
of work

INT STOCKHOLM CONCERT HALL -- NIGHT 47

We see Dr Ekeberg standing at the podium on the grand Nobel
stage delivering his ode to Joe On one side of the stage is
KING GUSTAV OF SWEDEN QUEEN SYLVIA and the elderly CROWN
PRINCESS VICTORIA who are in their full royal regalia --
medals ribbons tiaras and all

On the other side We see Joe sitting with his fellow
laureates along with the solemn MEMBERS OF THE ACADEMY who
are there to bear witness to his lionization

DR EKEBERG
With each book Mr Castleman you
have challenged the novelistic form
and reinvented the very nature of
storytelling and of prose You are
a master of style yet your
characters are intensely real
their journeys heartbreaking their
portrayals intimate and deep

We see Joan sitting with the other LAUREATE FAMILIES Next
to her is Davids empty seat She’s staring at the stage
listening to this man talking about her work her voice her
gift

Up in the peanut gallery we see Nathaniel Bone in his rented
tux madly taking notes in his pad with a gleeful little grin
on his face

DR EKEBERG (CONTD)
The humanity in your writing
transcends the boundaries of class
and gender You are a master of
words but more importantly you
are a master at portraying the
human condition in all it’s
complexities

CLOSE ON Joe We see that he’s dying inside but trying to
maintain an expression of quiet dignity

DR EKEBERG (CONT’D)
Mr Castleman I would like to
convey to you the warm
congratulations of the Swedish
Academy as I now request you to
receive the Nobel Prize in
Literature from his Majesty the
King

THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 86

As Joe rises from his seat all the notables on stage rise
with him including the royals

Everyone in the concert hall rises as well in a great whoosh
of tuxes and gowns

Constance Finch who’s so pleased and proud for all of them
reaches over to Joan and give her hand a little squeeze

There’s a reverent hush as Joe makes his way across the stage
to King Gustav

Joe bows his head to the King King Gustav says a few
laudatory words to him then hands him the Nobel medal which
is housed in a flat leather box As they shake hands a
FANFARE sounds and Joe numbly makes his three reverences

And Joan joins the audience in applauding her husband’s great
achievement

INT STOCKHOLM CITY HALL THE BLUE HALL -- NIGHT 48

We’re now at the Nobel banquet which is housed in a vast
glittering two-story hall Rows of mile-long tables have
been elaborately set with flowers candelabra and crystal
wine glasses to accommodate the plethora of toasts Seated
at the tables are SWEDISH and INTERNATIONAL VIP’S and their
patient WIVES all talking loudly intoxicated by the event
and the generous amount of wine being served

We see Joan and Joe sitting across from each other at the
table of honor with King Gustav and Queen Sylvia Joe just
trying to get through the night has slipped back into his
role as the charming raconteur He’s been across the table
from the two royals who are both hanging on to his every
word Joan is between the King and a DIPLOMAT who’s
conversing with the WOMAN on his other side Having no one
to talk to she’s staying engaged with her wine

JOE
»SO you brown the brisket in the
pot and then you add two cups of
water some ketchup some garlic
salt and heres the secret
ingredient -- a tablespoon of
instant coffee

KING GUSTAV
Really This is a typical recipe
of the American Jewish culture

JOE
No its a typical reflection of
what a terrible cook my mother was

The King guffaws
THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 87

Joan smiles drinks down her wine A uniformed SERVER comes
by and Joan gratefully lets him refill her glass

A NOBEL HOSTESS approaches Joe and the King with great
deference

NOBEL HOSTESS
Excuse me Your Majesty if I may
lead Mr Castleman to the dais

KING GUSTAV
Yes of course

JOE
(to his table mates)
Excuse me I shall return

KING GUSTAV
Yes bravo please do

As Joe gets up he stares across the table at Joan They lock
eyes for a beat and it’s possible just possible that he’s
ready to tell the world

Joe moves off without another word leaving Joan breathless
She takes a healthy gulp of her wine to possibly prepare
herself

King Gustav politely turns to Joan
KING GUSTAV (CONTD)
Tell me about yourself Mrs
Castleman Do you have an
occupation

JOAN
Yes I do

KING GUSTAV
And what is that

JOAN
Im a king-maker

A beat The king finally gets it
KING GUSTAV
You know my wife will tell you the
same thing
They both share a jolly chuckle
Up in the balcony four TRUMPETERS play a fanfare
The Nobel Hostess is standing at a podium thats set at the

top of a grand staircase She addresses the guests in
Swedish and then again in English
THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 88

NOBEL HOSTESS
Your Majesties Your Royal
Highness Ladies and Gentlemen It

Mr Joseph Castleman

To great applause Joe mounts the stairs to the podium He
stares down at all the expectant faces his proud team
beaming up at him Linnea with her camera ready his fellow
Laureates looking at him with their deeply intelligent eyes
Joe’s mouth has gone dry He licks his lips

JOE
Good evening and thank you to the
Swedish Academy and Your Majesty
for your kind welcome and this
magnificent feast I am deeply
grateful for this honor you have
given me

Joe pauses

JOE (CONTD)
But really this honor belongs to
someone else My wife Joan

Theres a great rustling as everyone in the hall shifts in
their seats to look at Joan Joan girds herself

JOE (CONTD)
Joan is truly my better half She
has made it possible
for me to find the stillness as
well as the noise to create my
body of work Without her I am
certain I would not be standing up
here tonight I would instead be
at home staring at a blank piece of
paper with my mouth open in
stupification

Warm laughter

JOE (CONT’D)
She has been my sanity my
conscience the inspiration for
every decent impulse that Ive ever
had Joan you are my muse my
love my soul And I share this
honor with you

King Gustav stands cuing the guests to all rise to their
feet to applaud the lovely Joan Joan can’t believe that Joe
just reduced her to the wife yet again She’s livid but she
maintains her cool and obligingly mouths her thank-you’s to
the adoring crowd

THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 89

CUT TO 49

Joe now returning to the table The King and all of his
jolly table mates give him a round of applause

Joe goes over to Joan and gives her a kiss She can’t bear
to look at him

We hear another trumpet fanfare and the lights in the hall
are dimmed An orchestra starts playing a processional as a
column of SERVERS enter carrying enormous platters mounded
with an elaborate concoction of sherbets and spun sugar

Joan picks up her purse and gets up from the table

JOE
Wherere you going

JOAN
I’m leaving

Joe starts following Joan as she makes her ways between the

rows of tables and diners Joe takes Joan by the elbow and

tries to steer her away from servers who are now marching on
either side of them with their giant dessert trays

Joan trips a little in her heels Joe catches her

JOE
Joanie slow down

Joan jerks away from Joe and stumbles into one of the servers
causing his tray to upend spilling the dessert sherbets and
all on Joans gown

JOE (CONTD)
Oh Christ

The server aghast starts making mad apologies in Swedish
Diners are turning around A few GENTLEMAN jump up and offer
Joan their napkins

An army of STAFF swoop in to attend to Joan and the mess on
the floor

Joe is speechless with humiliation

Mrs Lindelof appears and starts ushering Joe and Joan out of
the hall

about all the years I’ve been
rubbing your back and bringing you
tea and cooking your dinner and
watching the kids so you could work

myself But have I ever said to
you I’m done with this marriage
I’m walking away

JOAN
No you had affairs

JOE
And I’ve regretted every fucking
one of them

JOAN
Oh yes you’d sob in my lap and beg
me to forgive you and I always
would because somehow you convinced
me that my talent made you do it
And if I felt too hurt and furious
to write you’d give me one of your
famous back rubs and say “use it
Joanie use it”

JOE
I never said that

THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 94

JOAN
You did Joe And lucky me I had
somewhere to put it The critics
loved the image of Sylvia Fry
scrubbing the tear stains out of
her good silk dress after a fight
wit her lover “Another Castleman
masterpiece” And your chest
swelled it actually swelled and
instead of being outraged and
saying “enough I can’t do this
anymore” I remember thinking to
myself “how can I describe that”
And you know what I did

Joan pulls a Castleman book out of the bookshelf

JOAN (CONTD)
Here it is in another Castleman
masterpiece

Joan tosses the book at the floor and pulls out another book

THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 99

We hear the tinkle of ice -- the flight attendant is
delivering Joan a scotch Its the same attendant who we saw
on the plane ride over

FLIGHT ATTENDANT MONICA
(softly)
Here you go Mrs Castleman

JOAN

FLIGHT ATTENDANT MONICA

coming over

Joan glances at the attendants breasts which Joe had so
admired

JOAN
Yes I remember

FLIGHT ATTENDANT MONICA

JOAN

FLIGHT ATTENDANT MONICA
You know I see a lot of couples on
my flights and you and your
husband -- I just want to say that

wonderful relationship

FLIGHT ATTENDANT MONICA
It was just something about the way

solemn He sees David sleeping and lowers his voice

process

JOAN

BONE

David stirs in his seat Joan gestures for Bone to get
closer Bone crouches down next to her

JOAN
What we were talking about the

Bone tries very hard not to look too eager

BONE
Yes

JOAN
I want to say that what you implied
isn’t true And if you malign
Joes talent in any way I will
take you to court

Joan extends her hand
JOAN (CONTD)
Good luck Nathanial I’m sure it

Bone numbly shakes Joan hand and leaves Joan touches David
THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 101

JOAN (CONTD)
Did you hear any of that

DAVID
Yes

JOAN

When we get home I’m going to sit
down with you and your sister and

I’m going to tell you everything

David stares at his mother for a beat

DAVID
-okay Ma

David puts his head phones back on needing to shut down
Joan tucks a blanket around him

Joan reaches into her purse and takes out Joe’s yellow note
pad She stares at Joe’s strong bold handwriting and his
endless list of ideas waiting for Joan to turn them into
literary gold She tears this page off the pad and carefully
folds it and gently tucks it in her bag She stares at the
note pad it’s vast blank page hers to filled by her alone
It’s too much to think about right now just too much
Overwhelmed she leans back and shuts her eyes we hold on
her for a beat

Then her eyes pop open Already a story is starting to fill
her head It’s not over She’s a writer still

FADE OUT

THE END
