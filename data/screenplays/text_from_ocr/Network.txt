a show around her -- The Wayward
Witch of Wall Street something
like that But of course if
her tips were any good she
could wreck the market So I
called her this morning and
asked her how she was cn
predicting the future She said
she was occasionally prescient

just hed a fleeting vision of
you sitting in an office with
a craggy middle-aged man with
whom you are or will be

An utterly bland office kept for visiting firemen
DIANA is behind the desk BARBARA SCHLESINGER is
sitting on the couch GLENN KOSSOFF is ushering TWO
GENTLEMEN out spots someone in the outer office --

KOSSOFP
(to antercom)
Ey come on in --

He ushers in a silver-haired suntanned fresh-from-
the-tenniscourt man dressed in California elegance
vakish blazer archetype of all LA television pack-
agers -- HY NORMAN -

ROSSOFF (Contd)
Ry I think you knew Barbara
Schlesinger bute I dont know
1£ you know Diana Christenson --

NORMAN
(sinking casually into
the visitors chaiz
crossing his legs
flashing a fully-capped
set of teeth)
Aas a matter of fact I think we
met during the 1972 McGovern-for-
President campaicn of which I
am proud to say I was a principal
fund raiser --

DIANA

(leaning across the desk

to shake his hand)
No Im afraid not Now Hy were
running a little late so Id like
to get right to it I haven idea
for an hour television series and
Id like to lay it in your lap
Reres the back-up story The hero
is white-collar middle-class an
architect aviation engineer
anything a decent law-abiding
man Ee lives with his wife and
daughter in a large city His
—

DIANA (Conta)
wife and daughter are raped and
hes mussed He appeals to the
police but their hands are tied
by the Warren Court decisions
Theres no thing but pornography
in the mevies and vandals boxb
his churena The animals are
taking over So he decides to
take the law into his own hanes

He buys a gun practices till hes
an expert He takes up karate
becomes a black belt an adept in
Kung Fu and all the other marti
arts Now he starts walking the
streets of the city decoying mugsers
into preying on him He kung fus
them all Pretty soon hes joined
by a couple of neighbors What
weve got now is a vigilante group
Thats the name of the show -- the
Vigilantes The idea is if the

law wont protect the decent people
they have to take the law into their
own hands

NORMAN
That may be he mest fascistic idea
Ive heard in years

DIANA
Right

NORMAN
And a shameless steal from a movie
Called Death Wish”

DIANA
I know And so far Death Wish
has grossed seventeen million coces-
tic It obviously struck a pulse in
Americans I want to strike the
game pulse Now let me finish Hy
The format is simple Every week a
crime is committed and the police
are helpless to deal with it The
victim turns to our group of vigie
lantes What the hell its FSI
Mission Impossible Xojack except
the herces are ordinary citizens
your neighbors and mine

NORMAN
(standing)
I find the waole thing repulsive
NI

e

DIANA
You give me a pilot script we can
use as a movie of the week for
January and Ill comsit to twelve
segments on the basis of that script

NORMAN
(turns)
Youli commit on the basis of the
pilot script

DIANA
Thats what I said Thats a three
million dollar commitment I figure
you could skim a quarter of a million
for yourself out of that Of course
we all know youre a highly principled
political liberal and you mey find
this kind of show repulsive --

NORMAN

(slowly sitting again)
Well -- not necessarily I deplore
vigilante tactics of course but
the vigilante tradition is a profound
even proud tradition in the American
social fabric This sort of proecran
also offers cprorctunities for coming
to grips with the burning issues of
our times to co meaningful drama and
at the same time providing mass enter-
tainnent

DIANA
Beautiful Hy

NORMAN ©
Who do I taik numbers with
Charlie Kinkaid

DIANA

him well go toforty thousand

Were going to need more chairs

In bg meanwhile SCHLESINGER is exchanging hellos
with the THREE WILLIAM MORRIS AGENTS and is being in-
troduced to “he LAWYERS and looking at baby pictures
proferred to her by one of the agents Its all joliy
as hell a let of chuckling and smiling --

SCHLESINGER

Anybody want coffee

LENNIE

KOSSOFF and a SECRETARY are hauling in chairs -

LAUREEN
(intozducing to DIANA)
This is my lawyer Sam Haywood
‘and his associate Robert Murphy --

Bandshakes neds smiles everybedy begins to sit The
SECRETARY goes around taking coffee orders --
BAYWOOD
(an old union lawyer
given to peroration)
Well Ms Christenson just what
the hells this all about Be-
cause when a national televisicn
network in the person of bubby
here --

- (indicates HERRON)

comes tO me ana says he wants
to put the ongoing struggle of the
eppressed masses on prime-time
television I have to regard this
askance -

More chairs are brought in DIANA would answer HAYWCOD
but he booms along beginning to hit his stride --

HAYWOOD (Contd)
I have to figure this as an anti-
thetical distraction The thesis
here if you Zollcw me is that
the capitalist state is in a ter-
minal condition now and the enti-
thesis is the maturation of the
fascist state and when the corre-
lative appendaces of the fascist
state come and say to me they want
to give the revolution a weekly
hour of prime-time television
Iifve got to figure this is pre
ventive co-cptation right --

The necessary chairs are in by naw and everyone is
seated The SECRETARY has sone off to fetch the coffee
A sudden HUSH fcllews HAYWCCDs Hecelian instruction
and DIANA would answer but HAYWCOD is new center-stage
into the full swell of rhetoric -

HAYWOOD (Contd)
The ruling classes are running
scared right You turned the full

HAYwooD (Contd)
force of your cogsack cops and
paramilitary organs of repression
against us But now the slave masters
hear the rumble of revolution in their
ears So you have no alternative but
to co-opt us Put us on teevee and
pull our fangs And were supposed
to sell out right For your gang-

’ stergold Well were net going to
sell out baby You can take your
fascist teevee and shove it right
up your paramilitary ass Im here
to tell you we cont sell out we
dont want your gold Were not
going on your teevee

A momant of HUSH in which everybody digests this
ing statement
DIANA
(sighs mutters)

Oh shit Mr Haywood if youre not
interested in my offer why the hell
did you bring two lawyers and three
agents from the William Morris office
along

MURPHY
(Mr Cool)
What Mr Baywood was saying Ms
Christenson was that our client
Ms Hobbs wants it up front that
the political content of the show
has to be entirely in her control

DIANA
She can have it I dont give a
amn about the political content

WALLIE
What kind of showd you have in
mind Diana

DIANA
Were interested in doing a weekly
dramatic series based on the Ecumen-
deal Liberation Army and Ill tell
you what the first show has to be --
a two-hour special on Mary ann Gifford
We open this two-hour ssecial with
that bank ripofi feotage which is
terrific stuff and then we tell

(MORE)

open-
ry

Everybody

DIANA (Contd)
the story of how a rich young heiress
like Mary Ann Gifford becomes a
flaming revoluticnary Would you
people be interested in making such
a movie for us

lcoks to LAUREEN EOBBS

LAUREEN

The Ecumenical Liberation Army is

an ultra-left sect creating political
confusion with wildcat violence and
pseudo-insurzectionary acts which
the Communist Party does not encorse
The American masses are not yet ready
for open revolt We would not want
to produce a television show cele-
brating historically deviational
terrorisna

DIANA
Even better I see the story this
way Poor little rich girl kid-
napped by ultra-left sect She
falls in love with the leader of
the gang converts to his irzespon-
sible violence Sut then she meets
you understands the true nature of
the ongoing peoples stzrucgle for
a better society and in an emotion-
drenched scene she leaves her cevia-
tional lover and dedicates herself to
you and the historical inevitability
of the socialist state

LAUREEN
smiles)
That would be better of course

ED

What kind of numbers are we talking
Diana

DIANA
Well sive you our top deal which
I think is two fifteen and twenty-
five Youll have to talk to
Charlie Kinkaid about that But
as long as were talking series
now Ill tell you what I want
want a lst more film like the
bank ripoff the Ecumenicals sent

(MORE)

ob
DIANA (Continued)
in The way I see this series is
every week we open with the authen-
tic fcotage of an act of political
terrorism taken on the spot and

‘dn the actual moment then we go

into the drama benind the opening
film footage Thats your job Ms
Hobbs Youve gat to get the
Ecumenicals to bring in that filn
for us The network cant deal
with them directly They are
after all wanted criminals

LAUREEN
The Ecurenicals are an undisciplined
ultra-left gang and the leader is
an eccentric to say the least He

calls himself the Great Ahmed Xhan

and wears a hussars shako

DIANA
Ms Hobbs Im offering you an hour
of prime-time television every week
into which you can stick whatever
propaganda you want Were talking
about thirty to fifty million people
a shot Thats a lot better than
handing out mimeographed pamphlets
on ghetto street corners

LAUREEN
Ill have to take this matter to
the Central Committee and Id
better check this out with the
Great Ahmed Khan

DIANA

Ill be in LA until Saturday and
Id like to get this ching rolling

remembered perhaps from an earlier scene where Frank

was in pitch darkness but now the enormous curtains

himself ascends again to the small stase and the rodiunm
- HOWARD sits in one of the 200 odd seats JENSEN pushes
a button and the enormous drapes slowly fall slicing
away layers of licht until the vast room is utterly
dark Then the little pinsrots at each of the cesks
including the one behind which HOWARD is seated pop

on creating a miniature Milky Way effect

A shatt of

white LIGHT shoots out from the rear of the room

spotting JENSEN on the podium a sun of its own little
galaxy Behind him the shadewed white of the lecture

Mr Beale The world is a collese

mined by the immutable by-laws of

business The world is a business
Mr Beale It has been that way
since man crawled out of the slime
and our children Mr Beale will
live to see that perfect world

Mr Jensen was unhappy at the

messase to the American feople sa
he wants Howard Beale on the

catastrophic in our thinking I
argued that television was a vola-
tile industry in which success and
failure were determined week by
(MORE)
NACKETT (Contd)
week Mr Jensen said he did not
like volatile industries and su¢cested
with a certain sinister silkiness
that volatility in business usually
reflected bad management He didnt
really care if Hcward Beale was
the number one shew in television
or the fiftieth He didn’t really
care if the Beale Shew lost money
The network should be stabilized so
that it can carry a losing shcw ane
still maintain an overall profit
Mr Jensen has an important message
he wants conveyed to the American
people and Heward Beale is conveying
it He wants Howard Beale on h
air and he wants him kept on

this es inflexible Where dces
