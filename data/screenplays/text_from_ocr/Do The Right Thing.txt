The greatest miracle Christianity has achieved in America
is that the black man in white Christian hands has not grown
violent It is a miracle that 22 million black people have
not risen up against their oppressors--in which they would
have been justified by all moral criteria and even by the
democratic tradition It is a miracle that a nation of
black people has so fervently continued to believe in a
turn-the-other-cheek and heaven-for-you-after-you-die
philosophy It is a miracle that the American Black people
have remained a peaceful people while catching all the
centuries of hell that they have caught here in white mans
heaven The miracle is that the white mans puppet Negro
leaders his preachers and the educated Negroes laden with
degrees and others who have been allowed to wax fat off

their black poor brothers have been able to hold the black
masses quiet until now

On a stoop a group of Puerto Ricans sits talking drinking
cerveza frio and playing dominoes One of their cars is
parked near the stoop and blasts salsa music

As usual we hear the rap music of Radio Raheem but
underneath the salsa music Radio Raheem does not like to
be bested the salsa music from the parked car is giving him
competition this is no good Radio Raheem stands in front
of the stoop and raises his decibel level

ANGLE--STOOP

The Puerto Rican men look at him then begin to yell at him
in Spanish There is a standoff the rap and salsa clashing
in a deafening roar One of the men STEVIE gets off the
stoop and goes to the car
