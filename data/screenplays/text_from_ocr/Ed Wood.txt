FADE IN
INT HAUNTED MANSION PARLOR - NIGHT
We move through a spooky shrouded parlor as a storm rages
outside THUNDER roars and lightning flashes in the giant
windows in the center of the room lies an oak coffin
Suddenly the lid starts to creak open A hand crawls past
the edge and then the lid slams up Famed psychic CRISWELL

pops out Criswell 40 peers at us intently his gleaming
eyes framed under his striking pale blonde hair He intones
with absolute conviction

CRISWELL

Greetings my friend You are
interested in the unknown the
mysterious the unexplainable
that is why you are here So now
for the first time we are bringing
you the full story of what
happened

(extremely serious)
We are giving you all the evidence
based only on the secret testimony
of the miserable souls who survived
this terrifying ordeal The
incidents the places my friend we
cannot keep this a secret any longer
Can your hearts stand the shocking
facts of the true story of Edward D
Wood Junior

EXT NIGHT SKY

We drift down past the dark clouds through the torrential
rain and end up

EXT HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

Weve landed in Hollywood 1952 Were outside a teeny grungy
playhouse The cracked marquee proclaims THE CASUAL
COMPANY WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY EDWARD D WOOD JR

Pacing nervously in the rain is ED WOOD 30 our hero
Larger-than-life charismatic confident Errol Flynn-style
handsome Ed is a human magnet Hes a classically flawed
optimist Sweet and well-intentioned yet doomed by his demons
within

The doors open and Eds pal JOHN BUNNY BRECKINRIDGE 45

for-a-career ingenue Shes near tears

are we gonna do

They all look to Ed awaiting a response He thinks a second
then excitedly CLAPS his hands

ED

DOLORES

ED
The ghost can be barefoot Give
me your shoes

She hands Ed her white shoes He snatches one grabs a pair of
scissors and starts CUTTING up the shoe Everyone is baffled
He keeps cutting the shoe and it slowly takes on the shape

of a dove

Ed then grabs some pipe cleaners works them into a shape and

sprints into the dressing room He takes some green eye shadow
and excitedly smears it on the pipe cleaners Ed then hurries

back out jams the green pipe cleaners into the cut-up shoe

and it looks like a dove with an olive branch in its mouth

The cast is flabbergasted

CREW MEMBER
Wow

Dolores floats down onto the stage holding out the dove

disastrous review Their faces get sadder and sadder and

PAUL MARCO

Ed calmly waves his arms for attention He tries to smile

ED

Hey Hey its not that bad You
just cant concentrate on the
negative Hes got some nice things
to say

(he scans the review)
See The soldier costumes are very
realistic Thats positive

Everyone kind of stares at their drinks depressed Ed
launches into an upbeat speech
ED
Hell Ive seen a lot worse reviews
Ive seen ones where they didnt even
like the costumes Like that last

Francis the Mule picture -- it got
terrible notices But it was a huge
hit

PAUL MARCO

Lines around the block

ED
So dont take it too seriously
Were all doin great work

CONRAD
You really think so

ED
Absolutely Its just the beginning
I promise this If we stick together
one day Ill make every single one

says and there is a hushed moment of dream-filled hope

Lugosi slowly sits up inside the coffin Bela is an aged 70-
year-old man once a great star now a faded memory trying to
hang on to his nobility Quite frail and tired he is still a
master of the grand gesture

An UNCTUOUS SALESMAN steps up Bela speaks in a thick
Hungarian ACCENT which gives him an Old World elegance

BELA
Too constrictive This is the most
uncomfortable coffin I have ever been
in

SALESMAN
Gee Mr Lugosi Ive never had any
complaints before

BELA

The selection is quite shoddy You
are wasting my time

Mildly annoyed Bela climbs out He straightens his cloak and
walks to the exit -- where be bumps into nervous Ed

ED
Excuse me Mr Lugosi

BELA
(irritated)
I told you I dont want any of your
goddamn coffins
ED
No I dont work here

the salesman Oh Bela looks back at anxious Ed

BELA

ED
I thought it was great You were
much scarier in real life than you
were in the movie

BELA
Thank you

ED
I waited to get your autograph but
you never came outside

BELA
I apologize When I play Dracula

me much time to re-emerge

A CITY BUS approaches

They reach a tiny well-manicured house Ed and Bela get out

BELA
(bitter)
They dont want the classic horror
films anymore Today its all giant
bugs giant spiders giant
grasshoppers -- who would believe
such nonsense

ED
The old ones were much spookier
They had castles full moons

BELA
They were mythic They had a poetry
to them
(he lowers his voice)
And you know what else The women
prefer the traditional monsters

ED
The women

BELA
The pure horror it both repels and
attracts them Because in their
collective unconsciousness they have
the agony of childbirth The blood
The blood is horror

ED
I never thought of that

BELA
Take my word for it You want to
score with a young lady you take
her to see Dracula

Belas eyes twinkle He reaches his front door and unlocks it
INSIDE its awful Squalid dark with skulls and strange
voodoo objects scattered about Up front hangs a large
photograph of shockingly young Bela handsome and regal

Ed is stunned by this dismal place but doesnt say anything
Within DOGS start BARKING crazily

BELA
Ugh what a mess

housekeeper

The dogs BARK louder

BELA

hand gesture at the TV

Bela smiles He gets up shuffles across the room and steps
behind a curtain Ed is puzzled Belas thin arm appears and
draws the curtain tight We hear mysterious CLANGING drawers
opening and closing and then silence

Ed sits waiting
Behind the curtain something DROPS We hear a muffled Shit

Ed is getting worried But then the curtain whips open and
Bela bounds out grinning Hes a bundle of energy

BELA

Belas heart is racing He zig-zags past ancient crypts

Gargoyles peer down The wind howls through the skeletal
trees silhouetted against the cloudy sky

Ed runs through the shadows trying to catch up

Bela flaps his cape up and down We almost think hes going to
fly

Ed races up then quietly stops He eagerly watches Bela
practically expecting him to turn into a bat Its a magical

crazed moment

can be shot quickly Cars parking
Patricks suicide me strolling as

After lunch well bring in the
Inspector and the Doctor The Doctor

Veteran CAMERAMAN BILL an old guy with thick glasses speaks

Georgie is flabbergasted He points urgently at his watch
Ed nods He motions to Conrad Get out of here Conrad runs
away Ed leans in to Bela

ED
Youre right Bela Now Dracula

BELA

Pad it out with more stock footage
add establishing shots

ED
Um I guess --

GEORGIE
Good And one more thing I think
your Written Directed and Starring
Ed Wood credit is a bad idea

ED
Why I did all those things Hell
I even built the props

GEORGIE
And you did a bang-up job too But
you dont want other producers to
know thats you in drag Trust me
Its a career killer

Ed is quite upset

of science which previously honored
me as a genius

Now here in this forsaken jungle

alright

STROWSKI
Yes the authorities have learned
how correct your findings were So
I am here -- sent to bring you home

-- the jungle is my home But I
will show the world that I can be
its master I shall perfect my own
