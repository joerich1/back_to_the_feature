INT COURTROOM - DAY

JUDGE CONSTANCE PURVIEW presiding Liz sits at one table
with NICK her lawyer A select few of the named plaintiffs
old friends of Liz’s sit on the other side with theirs

JUDGE PURVIEW

The defendant Andrew Collier has
filed a motion to have all claims
against him dismissed

(beat)
He argues that since his jewelry
business was a corporation the
plaintiffs should not be allowed to

go after his persona assets
Nick smiles at Liz Exactly

JUDGE PURVIEW (CONT’D)

When however a corporation is
underfunded it constitutes little
more than a fraud

(Liz looks at her lawyer)
Not only did Mr Collier steal from
his customers claiming to do
appraisals while swapping their
good diamonds for lesser ones -- he
funneled his ill-gotten profits out
of the corporation ard into his own
pocket He got rich the
corporation stayed poor and his
victims are left with nothing That
is not what the law intends

LIZ
What

NICK
Shhh

JUDGE PURVIEW
The motion to dismiss is denied We
proceed with trial
