Demis Roussos’ “Forever and Ever” starts us off
EXT CALIFORNIA DESERT - DAY 1

We’re LOW TO THE GROUND panning across the landscape until
we land on A TORTOISE an imposing prehistoric beast from
this angle Three healed SCARS mar its shell

A MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE HITS A CRACK splinters in the earth’s
crust directly toward the tortoise ORANGE LIGHT bursts up --

CUT TO
EXT DESERT DIRT ROAD - DUSK 2

A PERFECTLY CLEAR NIGHT SKY Full moon every constellation
We PAN DOWN to a MOONLIT DESERT DIRT ROAD LANDING ON

A solitary figure dressed in swim trunks and a Hawaiian shirt
trudging up the road This is NYLES He takes a beer fromhis
pocket and drinks as he reaches the top of a hill where
another source of LIGHT illuminates his face He gazes out
with a look of recognition -- and resignation

A LARGE ESTATE at the end of the road Strands of twinkling
lights extend down a dirt driveway packed with hybrid cars

Nyles continues toward the estate passing a SIGN “Tala and
Abe’s Wedding - November 9” stenciled on driftwood in white
Futura font Nyles SLAPS it down as he passes

NYLES
Nooooooovember ninth

PRE-LAP the sound of LAUGHTER FROM A CROWD --

EXT CALMADA ESTATE - BACKYARD - NIGHT 3

A Pinterest board come to life Under an intricately designed
web of lights fixed to palm trees FIFTY WEDDING GUESTS of all
ages and dressed in all sorts of hip eclectic attire sit at
tables assembled around a DANCE FLOOR where MISTY (28 a
bridesmaid with face gems) is giving a drawn-out speech --

MISTY
hashtag LifeGoals So this was
supposed to be three minutes and I’m
going on like ten Sorry not sorry

TALA (28 bride flower crown) WOOOs to Misty then cuddles up
with her groom ABE (28 dapper ‘stache) high on marriage
PRODUCTION DRAFT 4-6-19 2

MISTY
To wrap things up Tala girl
youre the sister I always wanted

TALA
Love you babe

AT THE BAR SARAH WILDER (32 cool tattoos an emotional
fortress Tala’s half-sister) scoffs at this as she waits
for her wine to be filled

Luckily she’s far enough away so no one heard her besides
DAISY THE BARTENDER (30 droll) who fills her wine halfway

SARAH
Throw me a bone this isn’t the day
for moderation

After a brief staredown Daisy fills the rest letting it
spill over the edges --

DAISY
This is bad wine

Sarah smiles tips 10 GLUGS half the glass and heads back
to the tables as everyone clinks their drinks for Tala and
Abe to kiss --

ABE
That’s my cue --

Abe always the charmer gives Tala a very PG kiss

TALA
You prude

Tala pulls him in for a more passionate kiss while guests
cheer them on As she releases him Sarah returns to her seat
across from them watching with quiet judgement

Tala smiles at her sister Sarah feigns one back
Misty turns the page of her notes --
MISTY
Oh wait there’s still another
page I’1l1 make this quick
The laughter is dying out This is really dragging on
MISTY
I decided to Google the two most

important things about marriage
Love and Commitment
PRODUCTION DRAFT 4-6-19 3

SARAH
Jesus Christ

Tala shoots Sarah a look Stop Sarah nods Yeah sorry

MISTY
Love is “to feel a deep romantic or
sexual attachment to someone” We
know they’re fine in that department

Tala and Sarah’s parents HOWARD and PIA (50s) wince Sarah
lets out an unconvincing chuckle

MISTY
And Commitment is “the state or
quality of being dedicated to a
cause activity etcetera”

Silence Crickets Not the triumphant ending she hoped for

TALA
Oh she’s done Woo-hoo

Tala and Abe stand and clap Everyone else joins in applause

MISTY
Without further ado let me bring
up the maid of honor the actual
big sister of the bride Sarah

All eyes land on Sarah -- caught mid wine sip

SARAH
Uh

Sarah doesn’t move Howard leans across the table

HOWARD
Get on up there peanut

SARAH
No one told me I was supposed to
give a speech

HOWARD
Of course you’re supposed to give a
speech you’re the maid of honor
That’s your main job

PIA
She’s been drinking Howard

Sarah looks at her sister and Abe apologetically Tala
struggles to hide her disappointment

NYLES (OS)
(Subtitled Italian Spanish and French)
Bonsoir mi familia et amici

MISTY
What are you doing

NYLES
Going in for the assist babe I’d
like to share my thoughts on love

MISTY

ON THE BRIDEGROOM TABLE

ABE

TALA
Misty’s boyfriend

DANCE FLOOR Nyles addresses the guests

NYLES
Here’s what you want to hear what
I want to say what you want me to
say What all this solipsistic
horseshit means

Sarah stifles a laugh Nyles notices

NYLES
You’re born lost then you’ re
found but we’re all just lost

am I right

Sarah watches intently Is he talking about me Other guests
trade awkward glances

NYLES
But these two Tala Anne Wilder and
Abraham Eugene Trent Schlieffen
you proudly wave the middle finger
in the face of all that negativity
Then you give it a thumbs up

Some smiles begin to trickle through the crowd

NYLES
Your optimism your selflessness
it’s in your blood

PRODUCTION DRAFT 4-6-19

NYLES (CONTD)
Just look at Nana Schlieffen After
narrowly escaping persecution in
Nazi Germany she devoted her life
to giving other refugees a safe
passage to the US

NANA SCHLIEFFEN
And I got a best friend out of it

NYLES
You certainly did Nana You see
Nana found hope purpose and
empowerment through love And I see
that same fire burning in you two
You’1l use your love for good To
inspire To change

Tala leans into Abe --

TALA
How does he know all that
Abe shakes his head -- he has no clue
NYLES

Tala Lovely stunning Tala
Tonight’s true beacon of altruism
There’s something most people here
probably don’t know about you but
they should so they can all
appreciate the wealth of humanity
on display I hope it’s okay

Tala has no idea what he’s about to say

NYLES
It’s not just time and money that
Tala gives to so many charitable
causes She donated her physical
self bone marrow While we all
gorge that shit she gave hers up to
Baby Brother Nico saving his life

Everyone is stunned by this revelation Tala smiles at
hipster brother NICO through scattered applause --

NYLES
You should clap it’s scary She
gave so much But now it’s time we
give to you

NANA SCHLIEFFEN (90s) smiles at the shout out while rubbing
the back of her Sudanese son JERRY (30s)

Nyles locks eyes with Sarah like he’s addressing her now

NYLES
Here you are On the precipice of
something much larger than any of
us facing that wide open road It
may seem frightening filled with
uncertainty But remember you are
not alone

Tala and Abe look at their guests hanging on every word

NYLES
Everyone here is your family We
are your world We will bolster you
up when you’re low and we will
cheer you on with delight in our
eyes as you fulfill your every
dream So raise a glass

Nyles takes a beer from the pocket of his swim trunks and
holds it up again looking at Sarah

NYLES
We may be born lost But you have
been found

energized by the LOVE in the air Tala Bhangras with her dad
Howard Misty shimmies with Jerry from Sudan Abe Soulja Boys
with his new mother-in-law Pia Brother Nico makes out with
an older WOMAN (30s)

Sarah nurses her wine off to the side watching Tala and Abe
RANDY (25 bolo tie top knot) drunkenly dances up to her

SARAH
I already told you No earlier What
makes you think I changed my mind

RANDY
I dunno you’ve had more to drink

SARAH
You can’t say that to me --
PRODUCTION DRAFT 4-6-19 7

RANDY
Oh whatever I don’t have time for
a lecture

Randy dances away one hand in the air Sarah shakes her
head and as she takes another sip of wine -- she locks eyes
with Nyles across the dance floor smiling back at her

Nyles struts onto the dance floor navigating the sea of
partiers with a cool familiarity He effortlessly anticipates
each passing guest’s dance moves and incorporates them into
his own unique complicated and fucking bizarre routine

He weaves his way over and presents himself in front of
Sarah holding out his hand Dance with me

She shakes her head Not a chance

He tucks in his Hawaiian shirt slicks his hair back licks
his fingers and grooms his eyebrows then pirouettes

There’s intrigue on her face at least Her aloof facade may be
dropping But she still declines

Nyles shrugs cartwheels back to the center of the floor and
continues letting loose with Sarah’s family -- high-fives to
Abe a twirl for Pia an undeniable master of this universe

Off Sarah increasingly curious about this odd stranger

EXT CALMADA ESTATE - BACKYARD - LATER 5

As Nyles waits patiently at THE BAR something hits his
senses He SNIFFS the air looks around suddenly alert --

OFF IN THE DISTANCE behind some shrubs shrouded in darkness

a silhouette swaying side to side Is that a person

What are you smelling
Startled Nyles spins to find Sarah He sniffs her hair
NYLES

NYLES
I know my hair mists Dated a girl
who bathed in it
PRODUCTION DRAFT 4-6-19 8

SARAH
I hate it but it was a birthday
present from Tala last year and
she’d kill me if I didn’t wear it

Daisy returns with two COCKTAILS Nyles offers one to Sarah

NYLES
I always order two drinks at a
time Saves an extra trip

SARAH
Or maybe you’re an alcoholic

Nyles shrugs Yeah maybe She takes the drink they cheers
then meander away from the bar

SARAH

NYLES
Nyles So what’s the deal you
don’t like to dance

SARAH

Sarah smiles just as Nana Schlieffen interjects

NANA SCHLIEFFEN
Dear I’ve been to more weddings in
my life than you could imagine --

NYLES
Youd be surprised

NANA SCHLIEFFEN
I have to say that your speech was
the best wedding speech I have ever
heard Shukraan

Nana Schlieffen hugs Nyles and walks off
SARAH
You don’t actually believe any of
that stuff you spouted right

NYLES
Not a word We’re all fucking alone
PRODUCTION DRAFT 4-6-19 9

An OS COUGH Nyles’ eyes dart to figure by the shrubs again

NYLES

What’s the rush

NYLES
Your dad and mom are about to --

SARAH
Step mom My mom’s dead

NYLES
Oh Yeah they’re about to sing and
I can’t handle that right now

Nyles gestures to the DANCE FLOOR where Pia and Howard are
setting up to sing a song

As Sarah looks over Nyles glances back to the desert
shrubs then Randy emerges from behind zipping up his
pants He was just peeing Nyles exhales with total relief
and turns back to Sarah with a renewed ease about him

SARAH
What would Misty think about us
running off together

the desert He actually does seem a little affected by this

Sarah slides down beside him Misty’s MOANS continue

EXT DESERT - ON TOP OF A BOULDER - NIGHT 7

Nyles and Sarah make out on top of a small boulder not far
from the party Sarah keeps trying to untie Nyles’ board
shorts but they’re double knotted

SARAH
Okay I give up Take off your
clothes

NYLES
You got it

Nyles stands up and seductively unbuttons the top button of
his shirt the second then he RIPS it off

Nyles moves to his board shorts but they’re tied too tight
for him too His faux suave-ness on hold as he focuses in--

NYLES
Almost got ‘em

And he gets it He yanks them off so he’s down to just
his boxer-briefs

THWACK AN ARROW FLIES INTO NYLES’ SHOULDER

NYLES
AGGGHH FUCK

SARAH SCREAMS

Nyles spots a MAN (50s) in army fatigues and a HUNTING BOW at
the base of the boulder

NYLES
I thought I smelled you you piece
of shit
Nyles PULLS the arrow OUT of his shoulder
SARAH
What the fuck is going on Who is

The Man begins to climb up to them Nyles staggers away from

Sarah slides down the opposite face of the boulder and runs
off into the desert the Man in pursuit

EXT DESERT VALLEY - MOMENTS LATER 8

Nyles rounds a corner and pauses to catch his breath He
turns around Looks like he lost the Man

THWACK AN ARROW FLIES INTO HIS THIGH Nyles SCREAMS

NYLES
You’re a sick fuck Roy

Nyles sprints with everything he has around a bend ROY (the
man) scurries out of the shadows after him

EXT DESERT HILLSIDE - MOMENTS LATER 9
Nyles hobbles around the bend losing blood slowing down
and he collapses before a mound of boulders blanketing the
side of a hill almost at his destination

A TRIANGLE-SHAPED CAVE in the hillside twenty feet ahead

But he can’t make it in time -- Roy’s grunting just around
the bend

PRODUCTION DRAFT 4-6-19 13

Quick decision -- Nyles army crawls to the other side ofa
nearby Joshua Tree concealed by darkness He holds his
breath remaining completely silent just as --

Roy rounds the bend -- and stops before the cave Roy looks
around but he can’t see Nyles It’s too dark

NYLES’ POV Roy’s menacing silhouette fifteen feet away Roy
shouts into the cave

ROY
Keep running shit bird I’11l
always find you

Then with a disappointed sigh Roy marches forward -- into
the cave And after a few seconds Roy vanishes Weird

Relieved yet still in excruciating pain Nyles uses his
remaining strength to crawl into the cave following Roy

INT CAVE - CONTINUOUS 10
Nyles goes deeper groaning and wincing with each movement

SARAH (0S)
(a loud whisper)
Hey

He turns his head to find Sarah twenty feet back standing
at the mouth of the cave

NYLES
Stop No no no --

SARAH
Are you okay

NYLES
Don’t come in here --

MISTY
I have to get ready Just finish on
your own Watch me I don’t care

Misty heads to the bedroom

NYLES
Cool yeah that’s romantic

Nyles tries masturbating watching her dig in her suitcase

But he catches his reflection in the mirror -- sweat beading
on his chest hair fat jiggling with each stroke He grimaces
back full of shame a weak man trying to feel something
So he strokes harder faster FASTER --

INT NYLES AND MISTYS BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 13

Starfished on the bed Nyles cycles through every channel on
TV never stopping Misty pulls on her bridesmaid’s dress

MISTY
No offense but you’re the only guy
I’ve been with who’s had a problem
coming And don’t say the age
thing I’ve had older boyfriends

Nyles keeps his eyes locked on the TV

NYLES
It’s not you it’s me

Nyles sees Jerry looks back to Sarah -- panics -- and
submerges himself to escape

SARAH
Hello

Nothing But something about the cave draws her in Some
intangible urge she can’t resist a black hole of curiosity
and escape she has to know what’s inside She steps forward

INT CAVE - CONTINUOUS 18

Sarah’s hands trace the walls for guidance The moonlight
dims as she goes deeper Until it’s completely PITCH BLACK

distance growing brighter the closer she gets It lights up
her face revealing a mix of wonder and fear --

He stares off dwelling on the chaotic turn of events
cans litter the pool bottom

Beer

Sarah wanders out of the house physically and emotionally

drained and collapses onto one of the chairs

Nyles tries to bury any semblance of guilt and smiles as

he cracks open another beer

into her chair approaching if not already at complete
hopelessness Nyles feels bad A little

tomorrow So she’1ll still have her
dream wedding That’s good right

miles of boulders and hills that all look the same She

festering sunburn She stares dead-eyed at the sky Then --

Nyles steps up drinking a beer He offers her a sip and she
quickly takes it Any liquid helps

SARAH
Please Where is it

NYLES
You have to wait

SARAH
Fuck you Just tell me

Nyles gives up and points to the other side of the canyon
Almost directly across from them But there’s no cave

SARAH
Where

Nyles looks toward the horizon watching He takes a few
steps back to the left like he’s looking for his mark

NYLES
Wait for it Almost Okay
(dead serious)
I am the Antichrist
PRODUCTION DRAFT 4-6-19 25

Nyles SNAPS his fingers -- and an EARTHQUAKE BEGINS
Sarah freezes bracing herself --

Nyles casually drinks his beer as ROCKS TUMBLE out of place
careening across the canyon landing all AROUND him

The earthquake stops Nyles satisfied with himself looks
back at Sarah -- what the fuck was that

NYLES
I’m kidding there is no god the
earthquake happens every day But --

Nyles points across the canyon -- to the cave right there in
plain sight Sarah heads over intent on ending this day

NYLES
You won’t find what you’re looking
for in there Once you go in the day
will just restart right back to
wherever you woke up this morning

Sarah pauses

NYLES
Same thing if you stick around The
second you fall asleep it just
starts over Weird huh

SARAH
But will this day end if I goin
there

NYLES

Sure For you
Sarah continues into the cave and vanishes in the darkness
All alone now Nyles sips his beer conflicted He looks back
toward the direction of the wedding and all of its tumult
And into the cave now with an entirely different feeling of
dread He hangs his head unable to make a decision

NYLES
You have a destination in mind or
are you just driving aimlessly
Because if so I’d much rather go
for a float

SARAH
Stop talking Let me think

He offers her a beer and she swiftly accepts pleasing him
SARAH
What is this I get that it’s the
same day But what is it

Nyles inhales gearing up to give what feels like a rehearsed
speech aimed at quashing any further questioning
PRODUCTION DRAFT 4-6-19 30

NYLES

(in one breath)
I have no idea what it is This
might be life this might be death
might be a dream I could be
imagining you you could be
imagining me might be purgatory
or this might be a glitch in the
simulation we’re in

(and in another breath)
So after a while I stopped caring
altogether The only way to
actually live in this world is to
embrace the fact that nothing
matters Disappointment regret
guilt will just drive you bonkers

Nyles exhales sips a beer

SARAH
Then what’s the point of living

Sarah presses down on the gas the car accelerates

NYLES
Well you have no choice but to
live so I guess you gotta learn to
suffer existence

SARAH
So we can’t die

NYLES
No The day just starts over Or
maybe we can but I haven’t figured
out the proper way to kill myself
and I’ve tried them all
(sips his beer)
Slow down a bit

SARAH
Why slow down if nothing matters

Sarah’s becoming unhinged Nyles tries a softer approach

NYLES
You have to find what brings you
peace For me it’s floating in the
pool with a beer I think everyone
can find peace in that So why
don’t we turn this car around and
hit the water

PRODUCTION DRAFT 4-6-19 31

SARAH
(staring ahead)
No I need to get out of this

Sarah keeps a serious dogged expression She stomps down on
the gas and the car quickly gains speed 100mph -- 115mph --

Nyles grows irritated He unbuckles his seatbelt and
maneuvers into an odd super unsafe crash position

SARAH
What are you doing

NYLES
Bracing for a quick death We can’t
die but pain is a very real thing
There’s nothing worse than dying
slowly in the ICU

Sarah keeps gaining speed But at another glance at Nyles in
his crash position she too unbuckles her seatbelt

ON THE ROAD AHEAD a truck drives in the oncoming lane Sarah
doesn’t let up She slowly drifts into the other lane

Nyles peeks up to see He’s more annoyed than anything

NYLES
We can skip this whole phase and
just have a drink at the bar
(off her silence)
Or not Whatever See you tomorrow

Sarah stares ahead -- the oncoming truck gets closer flashes
its lights -- but Sarah doesn’t slow down CloserCloser

Nyles keeps watching Darla Sarah keeps staring at him
waiting for an answer He finally looks over

NYLES

Because Misty’s cheating on you

NYLES
Nah I don’t care about that We
have sex all the time But no
matter how you feel about someone
physically or emotionally the
novelty is bound to fade

Sarah studies him Is he being serious Hard to tell

SARAH
But to have to live with that over
and over again to experience that
level of betrayal every day that
might really fuck a person up

Nyles studies her

NYLES
Yeahhh but it’d be pretty pathetic
of me to hold a grudge

Nyles finishes off his beer Sarah reaches under the table
and grabs two more from the box of beer

SARAH
What about fucking other people

NYLES
Oh I have It just takes a lot of
work and I put very little effort
into my life

We’ve never had sex right

what you’re talking about

Nyles sees he struck a bad chord there

SARAH
Tala and Abe are like 95 of all
couples They hit the point in
their relationship where they got
bored but are so emotionally
stunted they can’t be alone So
they fall victim to the most
archaic patriarchal scam of all
time marriage Weddings An
industry designed to turn you
against the one you ‘love’

Nyles tries to chime in but Sarah gets passionate --
PRODUCTION DRAFT 4-6-19

SARAH
How any woman with an ounce of self
respect is okay spending tens of
thousands of dollars so their
father can ‘give them away’ AND
calls it the fucking high point of
their life it’s one of society’s
greatest tragedies

Nyles opens his mouth again but --

SARAH
Why when anyone tries to simply
start a dialogue is it always
suppressed Because we you and me
and everyone are weak We can’t
stand the idea of being alone so
we buy into the pageantry and
celebrate its bullshit

A long beat

Nyles sips

Sarah sits

NYLES
And the other 5 of couples

SARAH
They have a relaxed no-frills
celebration without any friends or
family just free booze and their
own mutual respect They party like

have incredible sex and then --
they get divorced We aren’t built

another person

earned our way out So tomorrow

bucks to spend

missing her teeth

SARAH

But there are millions of worlds

never thought of this before

something inaudible into her ear The onlooking crowd waits

Nyles holds up his half-eaten Twix and gestures to the area
that’s gone

NYLES
Everything in this void here where
the Twix once was but is now in my
stomach is the past

He gestures to the remainder of the Twix bar --

NYLES
And everything that’s left to eat is
the future encased in chocolate

Sarah keeps listening Nyles gestures to the void again

NYLES
None of this concerns me The who
what why of your past You got
here that’s all that matters You
ate some Twix and pooped it out No
need to sift through the shit

But if you really want to know
someone deeper it does matter You
have to know the whole package

These are fantastic mushrooms

Sarah stares at her burger It’s so juicy

Nyles digs through his memory it’s fading fast then
snaps back into it momentarily --

spent focusing on the past and
future will have been wasted
Energy is everything Energy is

me but I also know the center is
going to be the tastiest part So

NYLES
Don’t ever skip the edges

If you feel sorry for me that
means you care about me Nyles

NYLES

(deflecting)
When I say “I feel sorry” it’s in
the same way that I feel slightly
annoyed when I finish a beer and
need to open a new one

(he opens another beer)
It’s a fleeting feeling It drifts
away like everything else

SARAH
What else has drifted away

Nyles goes silent his thoughts take him somewhere else

now see she’s looking at a POLICE CAR fifty yards back

SARAH
This cop’s been following us for
miles

Nyles doesn’t care He’s more concerned by her sudden shift

NYLES
Should we maybe talk about it

SARAH
What’s to talk about it’s all
meaningless right

meaningless

choice but to remove you by force

car Still backlit but it doesn’t look like Roy This guy
has a mustache Nyles breathes a sigh of relief

NYLES
Okay I’m coming out

Nyles opens the door puts his hands up still holding his
beer and slowly stands his back to the officer

NYLES
Sorry Mr Policeman I thought you
were someone else

COP
Oh yeah who’s that

Nyles turns and locks eyes with the cop who’s now at the
trunk of Sarah’s car And Nyles’ relief drains

It’s Roy wearing a huge grin -- and a fake mustache

and someone was trying to hurt you
Because I GIVE A SHIT which you
clearly know nothing about But had
I known I’d be stuck with a
pretentious wannabe nihilist for

bail you out with that ridiculous
speech at the wedding And it was
always nice because I never had to
deal with it the next day But I
guess now I do

They stare at each other for a moment letting it all sink
in Sarah’s lip begins to quiver but she fights it back

though the chronology protection
hypothesis and quantum fluctuations
theoretically don’t allow for

Nature prevents time travel The
earthquake broke nature

NYLES
(unconvincing)
Right I hear that

SARAH
No listen this is serious

Sarah grabs her LIPSTICK and draws a DIAGRAM on the mirror
starting with a LONG PIPE --

SARAH
This is the cave It’s also life
birth and death our consciousness
the timeline we all live on but
it’s simpler to think of it solely
as the cave We enter here --

She circles the left entry --

SARAH
-- and what’s supposed to happen in
life is we just walk through this
tube to the other end continuing on
this regular timeline But much
like an earthquake can break pipes
underground it broke our pipe

She circles a section of the pipe --

SARAH
This is the part where it all turns
orange where we’re sucked in For
exactly 32 seconds we lose control
of our bodies and what’s happening
is we’re being sucked down into this
fissure caused by the earthquake
back to the moment we wake up

Sarah draws a line down from the fissure back to the start

NYLES
(trying to follow)
Okay I really missed you

SARAH
Nyles try to focus Here --
(circling the fissure again)
This is a highly concentrated
energy source Remember you said
it yourself Energy Is Everything
We’re trapped in a box of energy

Sarah draws a BOX around the entire graphic

We destroy the energy source in
that 32 second window we break
the box At least I think

Sarah goes back to applying her make-up pleased with herself

NYLES
And then what there’s like more
boxes outside the box

SARAH
I don’t know maybe we wake up and
it’s today maybe it’s twenty years
from now or we’re dead under a
pile of rocks I can’t be sure of
any of it that’s why it’s a
theory But we have to try

Sarah’s making somewhat of a convincing argument but Nyles
remains skeptical

NYLES
Okay And by “break the box” you
mean

SARAH

We blow up ourselves and the cave
in that 32 second window Then
we’re out

Sarah moves onto her mascara so confident in her plan

NYLES
I dunno I mean I’ve killed myself
so many times and I’m still here in
“this box” right I just think you
might be setting yourself up for
disappointment again Remember your
karma experiment

So you’re saying that out there

SARAH
When I was twelve and I just
started at this new school truly
terrified of the world I kept
having these awful nightmares
I’d wake up screaming and drenched
in sweat And then one morning I
woke up after a full night of
sleep no sweat nothing and I
find Tala asleep next to me
holding me She said I’d been
crying in my sleep so she crawled
in bed to snuggle hoping that
might help She was five-years-old
And I never had another nightmare

The two sisters share a blissful teary smile

selflessness that’s special and

Sarah pauses She swallows her vulnerability

SARAH
Big sisters are supposed to teach
baby sisters but I will today and
forever and ever and ever be
learning from you

Tala dabs her eyes trying to keep it together

SARAH
So now Abe
Abe leans forward expecting some kind words It’s a super
long pause Nana Schlieffen chuckles

INT ROADSIDE BIKER BAR - NIGHT 123

Nyles sulks at the bar swirling a glass of whiskey PUSH IN
on that empty mug of his Until he DROPS his face down on
the bar Darla slides up and rubs his leg Nyles shoots up

DARLA
You okay sweetheart

NYLES
Ive felt everything Ill ever feel
so Ill never feel ever again

Darla looks to Ted the Bartender --

DARLA

TED THE BARTENDER

NYLES
I thought I knew how to live But I
didn’t Or don’t You know what
I mean

DARLA

PRODUCTION DRAFT 4-6-19 99

But now TIME SLOWS for Nyles as he locks eyes with Darla --

He turns back to the bar digesting this odd profundity
staring into the MIRROR behind dusty liquor bottles --

FROM OVER NYLES’ SHOULDER REFLECTED IN THE MIRROR WE WATCH

A giddy Sarah leading a blindfolded Nyles into his surprise
shindig filled with decorations and a giant ‘HAPPY MILLIONTH
BIRTHDAY DIPSHIT’ sign that joyous tableau from their
early days together She removes his blindfold --

NYLES
Aw thanks dipshit I don’t think
I’ve been there thaaat long

SARAH
Fuck if I know --

Sarah lifts up a CONFETTI CANNON and blasts his face --
FROM NYLES’ POV CLOSE UP AND DIRECT INTO SARAH’S GRIN --
Confetti pieces flutter around Sarah radiant with an
unbridled joy we haven’t seen She leans in and squeezes
Nyles in a hug then lets go and steps back bringing us
BACK TO THE BAR IN THE PRESENT

ON NYLES lost in this memory as Gram Parsons SWELLS

“Twenty-thousand roads I went down down down and they
all lead me straight back home to you”

NYLES
Oh god I’m a total idiot

Darla weirded out looks to Ted the Bartender --

DARLA
You sure he didn’t take something

TED THE BARTENDER
He’s sober Kid’s just moping
there

Nyles turns to them quickly piecing together a haphazard
plan He JOLTS up and defiantly shoots his whiskey
shattering the glass with a glare for Ted --

NYLES
I’m a fucking adult Thaddeus
PRODUCTION DRAFT 4-6-19 100

TED THE BARTENDER
Talk to me like that and you’1l be
pulling your teeth from the bar

Nyles sizes up the barflies leering at him He turns to Ted
and holds a peace sign and rotates it into a middle finger

Nyles LUNGES over the bar and latches onto Ted’s shirt as
some BIKERS grab Nyles’ legs -- the place erupts into CHAOS --
EXT ROADSIDE BIKER BAR - NIGHT 124
We HEAR the sound of a FIGHT SHOUTING GLASS BREAKING --

The front door flies open and the two bikers hurl Nyles face
first onto the gravel parking lot then go back inside

Nyles looks into his clenched hand TED’S CAR KEYS

Nyles pushes himself up -- with a bloody broken nose -- and
RUNS to Ted’s PICK-UP truck gets in REVS the engine --
INTEXT TED’S PICK-UP - NIGHT 125

Nyles presses down the gas -- SPEEDING DOWN THE HIGHWAY He
CRACKS his nose back into place --

He hits a POTHOLE -- POP -- and blows a tire --

Nyles jumps out of the truck checks the tire FLAT

NYLES
FUUUUCK
Nyles looks down the road -- and takes off RUNNING --
EXT DESERT VALLEY - NIGHT 126

DUFFEL BAG over her shoulder Sarah powers forth into the
desert -- on a mission
EXT SPUDS HOUSE - GUN RANGE - NIGHT 127

Spuds FIRES a shot at the Mustache Man target As he nods
with pride at his perfect shot --

NYLES (0S)
Don’t shoot Spuds
las)

RODUCTION DRAFT 4-6-19 101

Spuds turns and aims the gun at this mysterious man running
out of the darkness and into the flood lights -- a lunatic
drenched in sweat caked in dirt and out of breath --

NYLES
I need help A ride Anything

SPUDS
Who the fuck are you

Spuds doesn’t flinch Nyles plays his only card

NYLES
Thirty years ago you met a woman
named Tracy Holmes at a bar in
Aberdeen and after she popped your
cherry in the little boy’s room
she left town and you never saw her
again

Spuds’ hands tremble at the memory still raw while
maintaining his aim

NYLES
Spuds I’m your son

Spuds sheds a tear He lowers his gun totally buying Nyles’
story He walks up to Nyles and pulls him in for a tight hug

SPUDS
I always had a feeling

Mid hug Nyles glances at the GOAT PEN and considers checking
to see if Sarah was telling truth if the goat is really
gone But the clocks ticking He gets out of the hug --

NYLES
I love you Dad But I really need
your help The love of my life
might be leaving forever

Spuds wipes his nose and looks at Nyles with fatherly eyes

EXT DESERT HILLSIDE - NIGHT 128
THE CAVE Open and ready
SARAH Calm Resolute She stands just beyond the mouth

staring at it She takes a deep breath and pulls on a VEST
LINED WITH C4 She walks toward the cave

Just as she’s about to cross the threshold --
PRODUCTION DRAFT 4-6-19 102

NYLES (0S)
Wait Sarah

Sarah turns to see a DIRT BIKE weaving through the valley
Spuds is driving Nyles holds on tight to his waist

Spuds comes to a stop Nyles jumps off and runs toward Sarah

SARAH
What is it Nyles

NYLES
You were right I was scared but
I’m not anymore We’re all lost
but somehow we found each other
And yes I’m quoting myself but I
hope you can look past that
because I know you feel it too

SARAH
You don’t know what I feel

NYLES
But maybe I do
(composes himself)
Sarah from the moment I saw you --

SARAH
I don’t want another one of your
fucking speeches Nyles

She looks toward the cave back at him She does want more

SARAH
You get one more sentence

NYLES
Okay okay okay --

Nyles thinks for a moment

NYLES
Even though I pretend not to be
I’ve realized I’m completely co-
dependent but now I’m cool with it
because life is meant to be
shared semi-colon I need you
for survival --

SARAH
That’s your one sentence --

NYLES
WAIT
She stops

PRODUCTION DRAFT 4-6-19

NYLES
I need you for survival comma
but this is so much more than
that colon I know you better
than anyone knows you and that day
we saw the dinosaurs you said to
really know a person you have to see
their entire package the good and
the bad well you’ve see mine and
I’ve seen yours and you have an
excellent package Ampersand you’ re
my favorite person I’ve ever met
and yes it seems like crazy odds
that a person I’d meet stuck ina
time loop would end up being my
favorite person but you know what
else has crazy odds Getting stuck
in a fucking time loop Dot dot dot--

SARAH
Ellipses

NYLES
Yes ellipses thank you Ellipses
I hope blowing ourselves up works
but if it doesn’t it’s irrelevant
for me as long as I’m with you
And if it kills us well Sarah
Isabel Wilder I’d rather die with
you than live in this world without
you emphatic period

Sarah’s speechless for a moment

SARAH
That was a grammatical nightmare

NYLES
Yeah hopefully that didn’t
distract from my point

Nyles locks eyes with her letting his declaration
commitment linger for as long as he needs to

A beat

SARAH
What if we get sick of each other

NYLES
We’re already sick of each other
It’s the best

of
PRODUCTION DRAFT 4-6-19 104

SARAH
I can survive just fine without
you But there’s a chance that life
can be a little less mundane with
you in it

NYLES
Yes less mundane That’s a very
low bar great place to start

She cracks a smile

SARAH
OK come on Lets see if we blow
up and die

Nyles beams Spuds CLAPS watching from his bike

SPUDS
And that is love

INT CAVE - MOMENTS LATER 129

From the inside looking out Sarah and Nyles stand at the
mouth of the cave Her in her C4 vest him with a brokennose
A perfect engagement photo They begin their walk in

NYLES
So did that goat thing actually work
or was that bullshit

SARAH
Too late you already committed

NYLES
Son of a bitch

Sarah takes his hand
NYLES

Hey where do you wanna go on our
first date when this for sure works

The orange LIGHT on their faces Sarah turns to him
SARAH

A BURST OF WHITE LIGHT

CUT TO BLACK

FADE IN
EXT PALM SPRINGS HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY 130
Yesterday last year today tomorrow Sarah and Nyles

float on an extra large pizza raft in a pool burritos in
hand horchata in the pepperoni cupholders

SARAH
There’s one thing I still really
don’t understand

NYLES
Only one thing

SARAH
How did you find the cave in the
first place You had to find it
that first day at the wedding but
it’s like two miles from the party
not by any roads What were you
doing out there

Nyles takes a big bite of his burrito

SARAH
Seriously Honesty and communication
are key to a healthy relationship

NYLES
But is there any answer that’1l be
satisfying to you

SARAH
Yeah because an answer is
inherently satisfying It satisfies
the pursuit of truth And I like
truth I get off on truth

Nyles stares directly at Sarah

NYLES
But does it not run the risk of
disappointment if I tell you what
happened By this point your mind
is made up about me whether you
love me hate me or anything in
between

(MORE)
PRODUCTION DRAFT 4-6-19 106

NYLES (CONTD)
And if I tell you how I found the
cave that might give you a sense
of truth but will it be
satisfaction Our energy should be
focused on pursuing what gives us --

Sarah SLURPS her horchata loudly growing peeved
NYLES
Isn’t it more exciting to live your
life always having some sense of
mystery

SARAH
No That’s pretentious And dumb

Nyles ponders this for a moment A small raft with the box of
beer on it floats by

NYLES
Yeah I guess it is

Sarah smiles She stops the box and grabs a beer

SARAH
Beer
NYLES
I’m good Watching my figure
(then)

Look A turtle

Nyles points to the scarred TORTOISE walking toward them from
the other side of the backyard As they gaze at it --

Hall and Oates’ “When the Morning Comes” kicks in and --
We FLOAT UP AND AWAY from Nyles and Sarah And as we get
farther away from this secluded desert house we see

scattered civilization dinos in the distance Farther
away up into a cloud until we can’t see shit anymore
