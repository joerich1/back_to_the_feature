INT BEDROOM - BEFORE DAWN

22 year old Stephanie Browne is jarred from a peaceful sleep
as the alarm clock BUZZES She hits the snooze button and
plops back down onto the pillow After a few seconds of pure
sleeping bliss she wills herself up

She moves through her Ikea furnished bedroom past a Hang

there baby poster and into the bathroom
INT BATHROOM - A MOMENT LATER
Stephanie turns on the shower While waiting for the water

heat up she looks into the mirror and with exaggerated
pronunciation recites

STEPHANIE

There is no friction with proper

diction Good sounds abound when

the mouth is round

She catches herself on the last word a hint of Missouri
twang slipping through

STEPHANIE

Round

Yawn She slips off her nightgown and lumbers into the
steaming shower

INT KITCHEN -- MORNING

She opens the refrigerator A half grapefruit sits next to

inviting slice of chocolate cake Shes tempted but chooses
the grapefruit

The Van roars past She pets the Kitten It PURRS and licks
Stephanies face She sets it down

EXT UCLA - WESTWOOD CAMPUS - DAY

Stephanie enters the Ivy-covered red bricked Department of
Psychology Building

INT UCLA LECTURE HALL - DAY

RAY DALTON a handsome twenty-nine year old man is lecturing
before a class of UCLA students They listen attentively

RAY

The conscious mind abhors
uncertainty It seeks a pattern or
reason for everything When we
cant find that pattern or reason
we sometimes ascribe its cause to
the world of the supernatural The
spiritual world is created by the
human mind to conveniently explain
everything we cant So when does a
belief in the supernatural cross
into the field of abnormal
behavior Where do you the
Psychologist come in When these
beliefs negatively affect our
patients activities of daily
living Their jobs their friends
their sense of well being--

The class bell RINGS

RAY

Tomorrow well be covering the
clinical manifestations of
psychosis Youll find it all
t referenced in the text

The students pack up their books Ray smiles as he sees

Stephanie enter the lecture hall holding a bag of deli
food

A withered hand An involuntary tremor causes its yellowed
fingernails to SCRATCH across the surface of Stephanies
desk

SCRATCH SCRATCH

The hand belongs to MRS SYLVIA GANUSH the aged woman who

from another era The outfit is threadbare in spots but

Mrs Ganush coughs up phlegm and spits it into a linen
handkerchief which she tucks back into her puree She hands
Stephanie a bunch of crumpled papers Stephanie reviews

STEPHANIE
Mrs Ganush
The old woman nods

STEPHANIE

This is a delinquency notice it

Stephanie glances over her shoulder

STEPHANIES POV - HER DESK
Mrs Ganush looks around to make sure no ones watching

tips the bowl of hard candies into her purse She reaches
into her mouth and removes a set of stained dentures that

wraps in her linen handkerchief

She places a piece of hard candy into her mouth and gums it
with a wet SUCKING sound The Old Womans one good eye
wanders about in ecstacy as she sucks on the sugary treat

MR JACKS

Apparently weve already granted
her two extensions And you know
on this type of foreclosure the
bank makes a sizable amount in
fees

He hands her back the file

STEPHANIE
It would mean Id have to throw her
out of her house

MR JACKS

He leans back in his overstuffed leather chair and studies
her Stephanie glances to the vacant office of the Assistant
Manager The large oak desk The thick carpet

She sees a calculating Stu Rubin eyeing her from his
workstation

Stephanie takes the loan documents and places them neatly

woman kneeling before her She clutches Stephanies leg

her gnarled hands

Mrs Ganush finally releases her grip and bows her head in
humiliation

MRS GANUSH

You shame me

She composes herself Then slowly stands puffing up her
chest Mu3tering her damaged pride

MRS GANUSH
I begged you
Her one good eye fixes its hardened gaze upon Stephanie

MRS GANUSH

-and you shame me

Mrs Ganush suddenly grasps Stephanies arm Stephanie tries
to pull away but the old ladys grip is strong Mrs Ganush
reaches out to pluck the charm bracelet from Stephanies
wrist-- but the Security Guard intervenes

SECURITY GUARD

I think your business here is

finished maam

The Guard escorts Mrs Ganush from the bank Through the
bankss window Stephanie watches the Guard lead Mrs Ganush
work

to a old Chevy Cavalier on the street
Stephanie composes herself and when she again looks up the
old womans car is gone

Mr Jacks nods heads for home Stephanie loads a pile of
contracts a ruler and a desk stapler into a cardboard box
and exits the bank The Security guard locks up behind her

EXT BANK OF CALIFORNIA - PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY
Stephanie waves as the last of her co-workers drive off
then that she notices the battered Chevy Caviler Its

in the structure

Stephanie looks closer Theres no one behind the wheel
She nervously glances about No sign of Mrs Ganush
Stephanie makes her way toward the safety of her car

Her FOOTSTEPS echo in the deserted structure more loudly
than she would like

She arrives at her car and quickly gets inside locking the
seat

sweeps

wrists

before

back

doors behind her She places the box of contracts on the

next to her As she starts the engine she notices a strange
sight something moving skimming along the surface of the
lot

Its Mrs Ganushs linen handkerchief

It whisks about like a ghost swirling closer and closer
Stephanie watches transfixed as it flies right toward her
car It dips beneath her hood and is gone It suddenly

up into view flittering up over her windshield and is
carried off by the wind

Stephanie breathes a sigh of relief just as two wrinkled
hands come up around her face Mrs Ganush sits up in the
back seat of her car SHRIEKING with rage at Stephanie

MRS GANUSH

(In Hungarian)

You bitch I pluck out your fucking

eyes

Mrs Ganushs razor sharp fingernails lash out towards
Stephanies eyes But Stephanie grabs the old womans

halting her

The withered hands drop down to wrap around Stephanies
throat Stephanie fights for breath as she frantically
searches for a weapon Her hand finds the box on the seat
next to her She grabs a handful of colored push pins and
jams them into the old womans arm Mrs Ganush releases her
grip Stephanie has time for only a single gulp of air

Mrs Ganush grabs two fistfuls of Stephanies hair The old
woman yanks upon it Stephanies head is pulled back over
the edge of the seat Ganush braces her feet against the

of the front seat to pull even harder Stephanies neck is
now bent so far back its about to snap

Stephanies hand finds the stapler trips the release It
springs open She swings it back over her shoulder
Ka-Thunk Ka-Thunk Ka-Thunk
her

In

Stephanie

With each blow she delivers a staple into Mrs Ganushs
forehead

Ka-Thunk A lucky shot-- the old ladys white eye is stapled
shut

The old woman HOWLS but her grip on Stephanies hair only
tightens

Stephanie about to black out throws the car into gear and
hits the gas As the car accelerates Stephanie fastens her
shoulder harness with the last of her strength

The old womans stapled eyelid POPS open just in time for

to see an oncoming concrete column

Stephanies car slams into it Stephanie is held fast by her
shoulder harness

But Mrs Ganushs body hurtles forward over the front seat
impacting against the dashboard with tremendous force

Close shot of the old womans head slamming into the dash

a spray of broken teeth her dentures eject from her mouth

Both women are dazed from the impact Stephanie regains her
wits first She reaches across Mrs Ganush and opens the
passenger door

Mrs Ganush stirs but before she can come to Stephanies
foot shoves her out The old woman hits the ground hard but
she sits up suddenly with a SNARL and starts to climb back
in Stephanie shifts the car into reverse The opened
passenger door knocks Mrs Ganush back down to the pavement
The cars rear bumper slams into a concrete column

is dazed

Mrs Ganush crawls to her feet and begins limping toward the
car

Stephanie tries to focus A blurred image in the rear view
mirror Mrs Ganush running closer SHRIEKING with old world
rage

The Old Woman reaches for the opened passenger door but
Stephanie closes it and locks it just in time Mrs Ganush
furiously pulls on the door handle to noavail

STEPHANIE
I beat you you old bitch Next
time take your Geretol
The old woman bends down beneath Stephanies view
Stephanie

looks about Whered she go

The old woman pops up into view raising a chunk of concrete

and CRASHI Stephanie SCREAMS as the window shatters

The old womans head juts into the cart She clamps her

toothless maw down upon Stephanies chin Suckling it

gumming The old womans good eye rolls about in ecstacy

Stephanie SHRIEKS as she pushes the slobbering head away

Strands of spittle form a bridge from the old womans mouth

to Ste

phanies jaw

The old womans wrinkled hands grope about the front seat

She finds her dentures now damaged from the fight She

GRUNTS as she jams them back into her mouth She comes at

Stephanie mouth wide open and SHRIEKING

Stephanie grabs the wooden ruler from her cardboard box and

shoves it down the old ladys throat Mrs Ganush gags

trying to retch up the ruler

Then Stephanie is suddenly screaming herself as the old

1 Woman has grabbed her legs and is dragging her from the
car

Stephanie hits the pavement She shields her face with her

hands waiting but the blow never comes The old woman

standing above her WHEEZING

MRS GANUSH

You shamed me

The Old Woman reaches down Stephanie flinches
MrsGanushs

gnarled hand plucks a thin brass button from the sleeve of

Stephanies coat She waves the button through the air and

breathes out a single word

MRS GANUSH

Lamia

Clouds move past the setting Sun A shadow falls over
Stephanie A cold wind makes her shiver

STEPHANIE
What-- What are you doing
woman

up

Stephanie sits up reaching for her button But the old
1 moves it out of reach

MRS GANUSH

You want it

Stephanie snatches the button back Mrs Ganush smiles
cryptically as Stephanie stuffs the button into her coat
pocket

MRS GANUSH

Soon it will be you who comes
begging to me It begins tonight
when you hear the cry

STEPHANIE
What cry

MRS GANUSH

The Lamia Its coming for you

A large black BUZZING fly lands on Stephanies face She
swats it away Her vision blurs and she grows dizzy She
leans against the car for support When she finally looks

Mrs Ganush is gone

INT POLICE STATION - SARGENTS DESK - NIGHT

RAY (contd)

protectively and after a moment they walk on Stephanie
watches wistfully as a YOUNG COUPLE coo over their BABY
Behind the couple Stephanie notices a neon sign ina
storefront window It reads PSYCHIC

STEPHANIE

RAY

She cajoles a protesting Ray through the front door of the
establishment

INT STOREFRONT - NIGHT

A tiny waiting room A poster on the wall indicating the
energy meridians of the human body

RAY

I just hope to God none of my

students see me here Five bucks

A beaded curtain parts revealing

Rham Jas a small dark skinned fifty year old Indian man
He wears a plain black suit and a white turban His
inquisitive eyes evaluate the couple

RHAM JAS

Just kidding

Rham Jas gives Ray a tight smile

RHAM JAS

energies Sometimes these

energies are a foretoken of things

RAY

steep for this kind of thing

RHAM JAS

Then go There are many who would
claim to be seers But they are

Rham Jas turns to depart through the beaded curtain

STEPHANIE

She removes some bills from her purse but Ray waves her off
handing Rham Jas a credit card

RHAM JAS

Platinum card Very good

He swipes Rays card through the credit card machine

sit at a card table Stephanie giggles with excitement

STEPHANIE
Sorry
Rham Jas smiles back

RHAM JAS

Thats quite all right So you

wish to know something of your

destiny Very good We shall see

what the fates have in store

Rham Jas crosses to the window and closes the curtains

RAY

Freud said destiny was not an act
of fate but rather something
created by our subconscious to
control our conscious choices

RHAM JAS

That is true But We should not
pretend to understand the world
only by intellect

RAY
Carl Jung

RHAM JAS

Yes From his treatise
Psychological types

Ray studies this strange man as he strikes a match and

lights

a candle Theres more to him than meets the eye Ray
brushes

it off

RAY

Jung-- the New Agers favorite

psychologist

RHAM JAS

Because he wasnt afraid to bring
God into the equation
Rham Jas takes a seat at the table across from Stephanie

RHAM JAS

Your hand please

Stephanie extends her hand to Rham Jas He closes his eyes
and concentrates Stephanie smiles excitedly to Ray who
raises a skeptical eyebrow

Rham Jae concentrates his eyelids flutter Stephanie

uneasy The flame of the candle begins to flicker as a

sweeps through the room The wind chimes TINKLE Ray pulls
his collar closed against the sudden chill in the air Rham
Jass back stiffens

He releases Stephanies hand and stands He moves away from
the table uncomfortable With a handkerchief he dabs
perspiration from his brow

RHAM JAS

Stephanie places butter into a mixer for the cake frosting
Through the kitchen window we can see Ellen walking down the
path toward the street She steps through the iron gate
latching it closed behind her

EXT STEPHANIES HOUSE - NIGHT

Ellens car pulls away The wind kicks up whisking leaves
about as though something where moving up the path and
toward the front gate of the house

INT STEPHANIES HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

An unsettling SHRIEK what the hell was that Stephanie sets
down the measuring cup

She moves to the front door Locks it

She looks out the kitchen window The iron gate is now

It SHRIEKS as it swings back and forth in the wind

Suddenly the latch gives way and the windows swing open

SCREAMS

flash

1 Wind sweeps through the kitchen whipping dead leaves

The hanging pans bang together KLANG KLANG

Stephanie forces the windows closed

The wind dies The room grows eerily quiet

A car passes in the street below Its headlights sweep
across the house The headlight beams throw moving shadows

the wall Stephanie notices that one particular shadow is
darker than the others It becomes the silhouette of Mrs
Ganush but theres no one in the room with her

The car passes and the shadows vanish

Sensing something the Kitten arches its back Now

feels it A presence The light bulb begins to sputter

She holds her breath listens

The floorboards CREAK Something is walking towards her She
spins around but theres nothing there The SOUND of
footsteps drawing closer

She backs against the wall trembling

Suddenly Stephanies face is struck by an invisible hand

cries out Her mouth is bleeding
She runs for the door Shes almost there Her hand reaches
for the knob when something unseen picks her up She

as she is thrown against the wall She falls to the floor
Lifting her head she catches her own reflection in the

WINDOW
In the reflection as the light bulb flickers we see a

of ghostly hands that grope at her body They reach up
through the floor and clutch at her legs buttocks and
breasts

STEPHANIE
Get off me Get off
The phantom hands vanish Stephanie looks about eyes wild

closer

The muscles in Stephanies arms are trembling She is
weakening Mrs Ganush closes in about to clamp her teeth

must do She finds Mrs Ganushs loan documents She stuffs
them into a folder grabs her purse and bolts for the exit
Mr Jacks engaged with a customer calls after her

INT BACK ROOM OF RHAM JasS STOREFRONT - DAY

on a plain wooden tablea samovar brews a musty tea Rham

is reading from an ancient text He looks up from the book -
solemn

RHAM JAS
What did it sound like

STEPHANIE
Like shrieking It was awful
He nods Closes the book

RHAM JAS
That would be the Lamia The Black
Goat

STEPHANIE
Lamia Right Thats the word the
old woman used

RHAM JAS

It is a nasty spirit A taker of
souls A creature of misfortune for
you and those around you It is
often summoned by the Gypsies for
their dour deeds On the third day
the Lamia comes for the owner of
the accursed object

STEPHANIE
Accursed object What object

RHAM JAS

Something that the old woman took

from you cursed then gave back

Now it dawns on Stephanie She looks to the threads on her
coat

STEPHANIE
The button

Stephanies hand slowly emerges from her coat pocket The
thin brass button in her palm

STEPHANIE

- this

She holds the button up for him to inspect But its
presence

makes him uneasyHe wags his finger back and forth She

lowers it

STEPHANIE
What if I just burn the thing

RHAM JAS
No matter what condition the button
is in you would still be the
owner The Lamia would still come
to take you

STEPHANIE
Take me where

NO

Rham Jas gives her a sad smile and closes the text She

knows where Stymied she tucks the button back into her
coat

pocket

STEPHANIE
Theres got to be something I can
do

RHAM JAS

Yes There are many ways to appease

a spirit The simplest is a blood

offering An animal sacrifice A

small creature would do You could

sacrifice a chicken Its all in

here

Rham Jas produces a modern book on animal sacrifice which he
sets before her

STEPHANIE

No way Im a vegetarian Ima
member of PETA for Christs sake
I dont go around killing animals

RHAM JAS

You will be surprised what you will

be willing to do when the Lamia

comes for you

She considers his words looks down to the book

heart being cut from its body

CAMERA pulls back to reveal that Stephanie now site at her
kitchen table reading the book We see other diagrams The
rusty

deafening

heart being placed into a skillet over an open fire The
burial of the smoking heart Stephanies kitten PURRS as it
rubs against her leg

Stephanie closes the book shutting out the disturbing
images

She hears the SHRIEK of the rusty gate outside She moves to
the window and peers out The rusting iron gate is open
Stephanie senses a change in the room Shadows shift and
grow deeper The air is suddenly oppressive Something is
coming

She moves to the front door and puts her ear to it Quiet
ib But then--

SCRATCH SCRATCH
She runs upstairs into her bedroom and locks the door

INT STEPHANIES BEDROOM

She can hear the sound of the SCRATCHING even here

She rushes to the phone picks it up No dial tone only high
pitched static the sounds of the Lamia buried within

She sets the phone down

For a moment all is quiet Should she go back down Then she
hears a tiny SQUEAKING The knob on the front door turning
Then the CLICK of the lock followed by the CREAKING of

hinges as the front door swings open She calls through her
bedroom door

STEPHANIE

Ellen

But its not Ellen

Stephanie puts herear to the door The sound of an animals
hooves on wood Something is climbing the stairs It stops
outside her bedroom door

Stephanie holds her breath listening

She sees a shadow beneath the crack in the door

STEPHANIE
I know that youre there
The window behind her explodes into the room with a
thing

her

She

ROAR

She ducks for cover Another window is blown inward and the
glass sent her way She SCREAMS and runs toward the bathroom
door It SLAMS shut in her face

BOOM Another window is SHATTERED by the angry unseen

The force knocks her to the bed The blankets are torn from
the mattress throwing Stephanie to the floor The bedsheets
whisk around the room flapping and twisting about like

1b drunken ghosts

She tries to run but they tangle around her legs and yank

into the air suspending her upside down taking her on a
wild and harrowing ride about the room

Abruptly all the madness halts She drops to the floor The
bedsheet wafts to the ground beside her Whatever it was
-its gone Its quiet now A terrified Stephanie sits
shaking in the wreckage of her room

INT STEPHANIES KITCHEN - LATER

With a trembling hand she jams a ZAGNUT BAR into her mouth
and drops the wrapper onto a pile of others on the floor
She chases it with a double shot of Makers Mark Whiskey

GEORGE
Must be a very important loan

STEPHANIE
It would be the biggest that my
branch has ever handled

GEORGE
Howd it come to you

STEPHANIE

Well I was reading the Wall Street
Journal and found this innovative
medical supply company that was
interested in expanding but didnt
have the liquidity I met with
their CFO and presented a formula
for restructuring-some of their
long term debt It created an
environment where I was able to
offer them a rather attractive loan

lot going for you Stephanie

Your mother must be very proud

throat With all her might she emits a BARK and a large
black fly buzzes out of her mouth

Stephanie grabs her dinner plate and hurls it just past
Trudys head It shatters against the base of the door

STEPHANIE

Ray just stares at her A long moment passes as he wonders

maybe she isnt right

STEPHANIE

Unless youre willing to take a

chance and believe in me I cant

She steps into the car and drives off Ray watches her tail
lights as they vanish into the night

EXT ECHO PARK HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

An older home with bars on the front windows Stephanie
knocks at the front door

She turns toward a distant sound A chilling high-pitched
SQUEAL Was it just a buss air brakes or something more
When Stephanie turns back the door has been opened a crack
An EYE peers out at her

VOICE OF THE EYE

crowd

Stephanie to follow They enter a room filled with young
Gypsies drinking smoking and talking loudly in a Slavic
tongue

A WOMAN WITH A CANE shouts as she throws a pair of dice A
Hungarian man with a long braided ponytail curses his bad
luck as he pays cash to the woman

STEPHANIE
Where is she

Ilenka gestures to an area beyond the party goers Stephanie
t pushes her way through the crowd She stumbles and falls

the Corpse of Mrs Ganush
As per the custom of the Gypsy wake there is no coffin

her dead body that rests atop a coffee table

Stephanie has landed atop the corpse The leg of the coffee
table breaks under the weight of the two women Stephanie
tumbles to the ground the corpse landing atop her The

The dead womans opened mouth bobs up and down upon
Stephanies chin as through it were once again suckling it
Stephanie shoves the corpse off of her and backs away in
revulsion

ILENKA

The mourners replace the corpse atop the coffee table
Ilenka addresses the crowd in Hungarian She tells them that
it was this white trash farm girl that threw her grandmother
t from her home and that she now bears the curse of Lamia

A mother shields her daughters eyes from the sight of
Stephanie the cursed one then hurriedly kisses her
-crucifix A man spits at her feet then walks off

STEPHANIE

INT OLD PASADENA HOUSE - STUDY - DUSK

Milos a thirty year old Hungarian Man leads Stephanie
into

a large room with-tall teak bookshelves and Indian

tapestries that adorn the walls Rham Jas is seated ina

wicker chair speaking with someone obscured by shadows

RHAM JAS

Miss Brown Allow me the pleasure
of an introduction

A woman rises from the shadows

RHAM JAS

-Shaun San Dena

The eighty year old woman smiles a toothless smile to
Stephanie

RHAM JAS

Shaun San Dena is an experienced 41
medium Furthermore she has a
personal knowledge of the Lamia

SHAUN SAN DENA

I first encountered this spirit
forty years ago in a small village
outside of Bucharest

STEPHANIE
And

SHUAN SAN DENA
lost a young boys soul to the
beast

STEPHANIE
Thats reassuring

SHAUN SAN DENA

was an inexperienced seer then
ve learned much since that woeful
day I have waited these long years
for a chance at redeeming myself A
chance to destroy the foul thing
Tonight my chance will come But to
summon it I will need your help

STEPHANIE
ll do whatever it takes And the
sooner the better

SHAUN SAN DENA

Our business must wait till
darkness falls Enough time for
tea

INT GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

A ceiling twenty feet high with massive windows covered by
dark burgundy drapes An ornate crystal chandelier hangs
above a round table in the rooms center Stephanie Rham
Jas Shaun San Dena and Milos are finishing their tea
SHAUN SAN DENA

My late husband Sandor was also a
medium He chose this site to build
thehouse upon because he sensed
certain energies that intersected
here

(MORE )

SHAUN SAN DENA (contd)

He knew I would sense his spirit

in this place as I have sensed
others It was to be our way of
being together after he died In
earlier times it was a sacred place
to the Tuanteteck indians And
their stories told that the place
was a burial ground of the old
ones that inhabited the earth
before them Here there is a
particular alignment of energies A
confluence that allows doorways to
be opened Through which we might
pass

RHAM JAS

And through which others might
pass into our world

Milos removes the tea

SHAUN SAN DENA

It is time for us to begin

Shaun San Dena turns out the electric lights leaving only
the tables candlelight for illumination

We hear the BLEATING of a goat Stephanie startles Milos
reenters the room pulling a black goat along by a chain The
goat catches sight of Stephanie It BLEATS in fear and
attempts to run But Milos holds it fast and tethers it to a
post He moves to the table and lifts a velvet cloth
revealing a large cattle slaughtering blade

SHAUN SAN DENA
Lord Jesus bless this knife and

allow it to do your holy work

She makes the sign of the cross she pours a vial of holy
water over the blade She turns to Stephanie

SHAUN SAN DENA

Once the spirit has entered me
place my hand upon the animal Do
you understand

STEPHANIE
Yes

SHAUN SAN DENA

I will force the spirit of the

Lamia into the goat Milos thats
when you strike

Stephanie blanches but remains silent

SHAUN SAN DENA

We must allbe receptive

Shaun San Dena begins to intone a Romanian Gypsy chant
Stephanie leans close to speak quietly with Rham Jae

STEPHANIE
What do I have to do

RHAM JAS

You must allow the darkness in You
must invite the dead to co-mingle
with your spirit

STEPHANIE
Im scared

RHAM JAS

Yes Now repeat these words I

welcome the dead into my soul

Rham Jae waits for Stephanies response Shes shifts in her
seat uncomfortably

STEPHANIE
I welcome the dead into my soul

RHAM JAS

You must believe it

Stephanie takes a deep breath and they begin the chant
again

This time together

RAM JAAS STEPHANIE

I welcome the dead into my I welcome the dead into my
soul soul

Stephanie looks around the darkened room Shadows from the
candles dance upon the walls

SHAUN SAN DENA
I sense something here with us

RHAM JAS

Yes

The parlors crystal chandeleir tinkles

A tea cup and saucer tremble for a moment Stephanies eyes
search the room

SOMETHING UNSEEN

emits a wheezing breath

We hear FOOTSTEPS as something walks on the ceiling above
them

A MANS LOUD LAUGHTER
echoes about the room

SHAUN SAN DENA
It is not the Lamia It is the
spirit of some unsettled soul from

years ago The unsettled ones
wait near the door

THE PITCHER OF WATER
upon the table is drained Then the water is spat out ina
stream at Milos face
The MANS LAUGHTER again

SHAUN SAN DENA
Be gone foolish spirit
There is a HOWLING OF WIND and the room is again quiet

SHAUN SAN DENA

Show yourself Lamia We invite you

into our circle

Quiet Stephanie looks about Nothing seems to be happening

SHAUN SAN DENA
Hes coming

A faint sound

SCRATCH SCRATCH
The SCRATCHING OF FINGERNAILS on wood A sound that
Stephanies heard before It grows louder more distorted

SCRATCH SCRATCH

Stephanie grips the table

And just when the SCRATCHING SOUND is deafening All
becomes silent

Stephanie holds her breath

A wind whips up in the room sending papers whirling about
yet all the windows are closed

Shaun San Denas eyes roll up into her head She emits a low
and powerful MOAN Her head slumps onto her shoulders Then
she straightens with a new vigor Stephanie and Rham Jas
watch as her lips move rapidly and a garbled sound comes out
of her throat she speaks in a strange and incomprehensible
tongue

RHAM JAS
Who now inhabits the body of Shaun
San Dena

SHAUN SAN DENA

(demonic voice)

Lamia

Rham Jas nods discreetly to Milos who quietly uncovers the
slaughtering blade
RHAM JAS

Lamia what is it that you desire

Shaun San Denas chair abruptly spins about to face

Stephanie The mouth jerks opened and closed as if
controlled

by a bad puppeteer Then out ofsync the demonic voice is

HEARD

SHAUN SAN DENA

(demonic voice)

The soul of Stephanie Brownl We
will feast upon it as she festers
in the gravel

STEPHANIE
It was my manager Jim Jacks
He was the one He--

RHAM JAS

Silence Lamia please surely we
can dissuade you from taking this
insignificant woman Surely shes
not worthy of your greatness

The possessed Shaun San Dena laughs

SHAUN SAN DENA

(demonic voice)

No I will enjoy watching her skin

blister and pop in hells flame I

come for her

Stephanie quickly grabs Shaun San Dernas hand and places it

on the goats head

Shaun San Denas eyes clear for a moment as she struggles to

regain control

Now there are two spirits battling within her She attempts

t to force the spirit of the Lamia from her body and into
the

goat The Goat BLEATS and bucks wildly as the spirit is
transferred Milos raises up the slaughtering blade

SHAUN SAN DENA
(demonic voice)
No You--

GOAT

(demonic voice)

--tricked me

The possessed goat emits a terrible cry The bone chilling

SHRIEK of Lamia Its oval eye reflects the blade as it

descends toward it The possessed Goat jerks aside and the

blade misses slicing into the chair

As Milos raises the blade for another blow the goat bites

his hand In that moment the spirit of the Lamia is

transferred to him

A Possessed Milos SCREAMS and spins toward Stephanie
glaring

at her with black goat eyes He SHOUTS at her in a gibberish

of tongues His body jerks up into the air He dances a jig

atop the table now laughing uncontrollably

t

Stephanie watches in horror

RHAM JAS

Lamial I command you to leave this--

A chair sails through the air and shatters across Rham Jas
back knocking him to the ground

Milos body is hurled up against the chandelier shattering
it Glass rains down upon Stephanie

on the ceiling Milos is spunabout like a pin wheel
Stephanie races for the door but a

-huge bureau lurches in

front of her blocking her path

Rham Jas rouses a stunned Shaun San Dena

RHAM JAS

You must banish the spirit

Shaun San Dena places her hands on her ayes then over her
heart and chants an ancient Gypsy incantation up toward
Milos

Milos SHRIEKS A white vapor streams from his body as the
Lamia is torn from him

MILOS

(in his normal voice)

Stop the chanting I beg you

But Shaun San Dena only chants louder Milos SCREAMS grow
more intense as-his body spasms in pain Stephanie grasps at
Shaun San Dena

STEPHANIE

For gods sake stop the chanting
its killing him

Rham Jas pushes her aside

RHAM JAS

You must not stop

A withered pair of hands reach down from above and clutch at
Stephanies face It is Mrs Ganush that now floats above
her Her long yellowed fingernails scratching at Stephanies
skin

MILOSMRS GANUSH
Make her stop you dirty pork
queen

STEPHANIE

No Get her off

Mrs Ganush grabs at Stephanies head Stephanie pulls away
but it costs her a clump of hair that Mrs Ganush rips from
her head

Mrs Ganush opens her mouth wide wider still she
vomits out Stephanies dead cat It lands atop the table
Stephanie screams uncontrollably

Shaun San Dena is trembling as her chanting comes to a
climax

Mrs Ganush changes back to the possessed Milo The last of
the white vapor is torn from Milos body as the spirit of the
Lamia leaves him Milos falls to the floor and all is quiet
An ashen faced Shaun San Dena halts her chant
10 STEPHANIE

Is it gone

Stephanie notices that the cat has vanished Was it ever

there

Rham Jae kneels at Milos side Hes starting to come
around

Milos stands shaken The Lamia is gone

Shaun San Dena grabs at her chest struggles for breath

Stephanie rushes over to steady her

STEPHANIE
Let me help you

SHAUN SAN DENA

My heart

Shaun San Dena collapses into Stephanies arms Rham Jas
moves to assist her They lower Shaun San Dana to the floor

RHAM JAS
Milos call an ambulance

Milos rushes from the room to call for help Rham Jas
checks for a pulse

RHAM JAS
Shes not breathing
Rham Jas attempts to administer CPR to no avail

STEPHANIE

My God My God

He checks her pulse one last time The CPR is finally
halted

Rham Jas closes her eyes then touches her forehead

praying

Stephanie and Rham Jas watch as PARAMEDICS load the covered
body of Shaun San Dena into the ambulance They close the
doors and drive away

STEPHANIE

Strange how things work out She
waited years for another chance to
overcome the lamia and finally
she did

RHAM JAS

Rham Jas looks at her with pity

STEPHANIE

RHAM JAS

TheLamia can notbe banished by a
medium This was our lesson

STEPHANIE

But I saw her get rid of the
thing

RHAM JAS

No You saw her drive the Lamia
from the seance That is all It
will be back

STEPHANIE
But then what am I supposed to do
Rham Jas shrugs He fishes in his pocket for his car keys

RHAM JAS

Perhaps on this final evening you
should finish up the business of
this world For before the night is
through the Lamia will come for
the owner of the accursed object

STEPHANIES HAND
Slowly emerges from her coat pocket She studies the thin
brass button in her palm 0

RHAM JAS
Unless of course you were no
longer the owner

STEPHANIE

No longer the owner I dont

understand

Rham Jas reaches into his coat pocket and removes a blank
envelope He places the button within and seals it

RHAM JAS

The Lamia comes for the owner of

the accursed object Just make a

gift of it

To demonstrate he hands the envelope to Stephanie

RHAM JAS
-and youve given away the curse

STEPHANIE
Why didnt you tell me this
before

RHAM JAS

Because we are speaking of murder

Stephanie looks from the envelope containing the button to
Rham Jas She places the envelope carefully into the side
pocket of her purse Rham Jas tries to conceal the sadness
and fear he feels for her

RHAM JAS

She nods goodbye as Rays car pulls up Ray opens the door

Her car crashes into a tree

LONG SHOT - CRASHED CAR

Stephanie pulls herself from the crash She glances up to a
flash of lightning It illuminates

The wrought iron gates of the OAKWOOD CEMETERY A hill of
tombstones beyond

EXT OAKWOOD CEMETERY - RAINY NIGHT
A light drizzle falls as Stephaniesearches the graveyard

the burial place of Mrs Ganush She carries the shovel
defensively ready to swat at anything that might leap out

her
She stops before a freshly dug grave A temporary marker
reads the name Sylvia Ganush

Shes scared now not sure if she can really go through with
it A church bell TOLLS five times Theres no time to think
about it Stephanie looks around to make sure no one is
watching then starts to dig

DISSOLVE TO

LATER - Its raining harder The hole Stephanie digs is now
several feet deep

CLUNK The shovel has hit the buried coffin The rain
intensifies

DISSOLVE TO

LATER - Mud is pouring down the sides of the grave In the
bottom of the pit Stephanie has unearthed the simple pine
casket She jams the shovel blade between two boards and
pries off the coffins top and shoves it aside

A lightning flash illuminates the corpse Mrs Ganushs

eye is open and staring at Stephanie
Stephanie stows her fear and pulls the white envelope from
corpse

up

her coat

16 40

STEPHANIE

Im giving it back to you

She grabs Mrs Ganushs hand and tries to get her clenched
fist to open but rigor morris has locked it shut Stephanie
pulls with all her might causing

MRS GANUSHS CORPSE

to lurch up and out of the coffin Her dead arms thrown
forward from the momentum wrap around Stephanie Stephanie
SCREAMS The withered face leers Stephanie pushes the

away from her and the lifeless body falls back into the mud

STEPHANIE

Youll take it all right

She picks up the shovel and jams the blade into the old
womans mouth wedging it between her teeth She pries the
jaw open Mud and rivulets of water begin pouring down into
the grave from all sides The body of Mrs Ganush is quickly
being re-buried

STEPHANIE

I Stephanie Brown do hereby make

a formal gift of this button to

you Sylvia Ganush

She jams the white envelope down the old womans throat

STEPHANIE

Choke on it bitch

She kicks the old womans jaw It SNAPS shut trapping the
envelope between her broken teeth

Muddy water cascades down into the grave flowing over Mrs
Ganushs face It covers everything except the jutting
envelope and a single staring white eye

Stephanie tries to climb out but the walls are too slick
She grabs at a clump of sod at the top of the hole but it
tears away unleashing an avalanche of mud that buries her
the

SCREAM

TO

She

to her armpits

THE HEAD OF MRS GANUSH
Bobs up through the mud The Old Woman is grinning with

envelope still jammed between her teeth

LONG SHOT - THE GRAVE
Rivers of muddy water now pour in from every direction It
has become the drain hole of the cemetery

THE INFLUX OF MUD
pushes the old woman corpse against Stephanie Her grinning
face led mashed against Stephanies cheek Stephanies

is cut short as she and Mrs Ganush disappear beneath the
mud
The only sound is the PITTER-PATTER of rain CAMERA STARTS

PULL AWAY when

STEPHANIES HAND
rips up through the mud grasping the tree root

STEPHANIES HEAD
Breaks the surface of the mud sucking in air She claws her
way out then staggers away through the pouring rain

Moments before sunrise the sky is streaked red

Ray waits on the train platform clutching two tickets anda
small garment bag Behind him other Passengers arrive From
his pocket he removes a velvet case He opens it and peeks
t inside A diamond ring He stows it back in his pocket

He looks for Stephanie
Then his face brightens as Stephanie emerges from the
crowd
radiant in her new coat

sounds as the train approaches

CAMERA RACES INTO A HUGE CLOSE UP OF THE BUTTON with a
terrible CLASHING of symbols

Stephanie cant breathe

RAY

Stephanie stares at the button shaking her head in
disbelief The RUMBLING of the approaching train builds on
the sound track

RAY

What What is it

She backs away in horror but Ray follows her with the
button

still in his hand

The RUMBLING grows louder Shes backing up toward the edge

of the platform

RAY

Stephanie Stop

Ray steps forward still holding out the button Stephanie

SHRIEKS as she falls backwards off the platform and onto
the

tracks

In her last moment of life she turns her head to see

THE ONCOMING TRAIN
Racing at her

Through the swirling smoke the engines mechanical face
resembles the goat like face of the demon Lamia

It VOMITS STEAM as it angrily bares down upon her

THE TRAIN WHISTLE SHRIEKS

Stephanie recognizes the sound Its a cry shes heard
before In every door creak in every cold night wind a
haunting soulless sound the cry of Lamia

Ray races to the edge of the platform The two lovers eyes
find each other one last time

Stephanie SCREAMS as the Lamia swallows her and pulls her
down into hell

THE PEOPLE ON THE PLATFORM
Believe they have witnessed a train accident but Ray knows

the truth He looks to

THE BUTTON
still in his hand

CAMERA MOVES CLOSER ON RAY

A look of dread Finally he believes
