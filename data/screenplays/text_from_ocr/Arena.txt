FADE IN

EXT MILITARY CHECKPOINT - NIGHT
Rain Heavy unrelenting rain

Two World War II-era British Army trucks splash round the bend
of a narrow shell-pocked lane and approach a heavily fortified
road block manned by British troops

SUPER ALLIED-GERMAN FRONTIER NORTHERN FRANCE 1944

A GUARD on the ground motions for the trucks to stop

INT TRUCK CAB - CONTINUOUS

The DRIVER (30s) and PASSENGER (50s) of the front truck squint
out through the rain as they slow to a halt

The air in the cab is thick with tension We soon see why

Despite the fact that both men are wearing British officers’
uniforms the nervous hiss that comes out of the Passenger’s
mouth is in GERMAN

PASSENGER
(in German subtitled)
Ready

READER NOTE From this point dialogue in italics denotes a
foreign language to be subtitled in English where applicable

The Driver replies without looking at him There’s a palpable
feeling of dislike between the two

DRIVER
This is suicide

PASSENGER
Not unless you fuck up

The Guard taps the window The Driver rolls it down leans out
and speaks in perfect unaccented ENGLISH

DRIVER
(in English)
Good evening Corporal I seem to have
forgotten to pack my swimming costume You
wouldn’t have a spare one I could borrow

The Guard smiles then notes the rank insignia on the Driver’s
sleeve and salutes
GUARD
‘Fraid not Captain Mind if I ask what
youre doing out in no man’s land sir
We didn’t send any patrols today

DRIVER
Were from the 42nd Engineers Supposed
to be tidying up a bridge near Abbeville
but it’s not there anymore Hit a spot of
bother heading back to HQ Mind if we
come through here

A SECOND GUARD walks up the side of the canvas-topped truck to
inspect its contents

GUARD
One minute sir

EXT REAR OF TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

The Second Guard pulls away the canvas flap and shines his
flashlight over fifteen nervous tight-lipped SOLDIERS inside
Apparently satisfied he moves onto the next truck

INT REAR OF SECOND TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Ten more tense SOLDIERS sit around a large wooden CRATE One
whispers to his neighbor

WHISPERING SOLDIER
Why dont we just kill them and go
through

A tough-looking SERGEANT glares at him and hisses

SERGEANT
Shut up

The canvas is pulled away from the outside and the Second Guard
shines his flashlight in The Sergeant plasters on a wide grin
and calls out in gruff Cockney

SERGEANT
(in English)

Awright mate You think we can hurry
this up a bit only Barry here says he’s
got a turtle’s head like you wouldn’t
believe and I don’t wanna have to smell
his shit for the next twenty miles you
know
He gives a loud laugh which his companions join in with The
Second Guard shines his light on the crate

SECOND GUARD
What’s in there

A Soldier subtly starts to raise his rifle The Sergeant stops
him with a look fake smile still plastered on

SERGEANT
Engine parts for a Lancaster bomber
Wanna have a look

The Second Guard shakes his head apparently satisfied and
moves along

IE FIRST TRUCK CAB - MOMENTS LATER

The two Guards on the ground exchange a couple of words then
the first Guard turns back to the Driver

GUARD
Thank you sir Have a safe trip

DRIVER
And you Corporal

The Guard pauses frowns

GUARD
Sorry sir

The Driver does his best to cover up the fact that his heart’s
just jumped up into his throat

DRIVER
I mean uh not a safe trip a safe
evening Have a good night Carry on
The Guard looks at him oddly for a moment then motions for the
trucks to be let through the checkpoint
EXT MILITARY CHECKPOINT - CONTINUOUS

The Guard continues to stare at the departing trucks for a
moment thinking

He walks over to a nearby Jeep and picks up the radio
INT TRUCK CAB - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

The Driver hastily rolls up his window as he drives off This is
HAUPTMANN (CAPTAIN) DIETER WEISS Not the kind of man who
usually makes mistakes but we can tell his heart’s not in this
mission

PASSENGER
Im only going to say this once
Weiss

The Passenger -- OBERST (COLONEL) GUNTHER STEINHAUSER -- doesn’t
take his cold calculating eyes off the road

PASSENGERCOL STEINHAUSER
If you jeopardize this mission again
Ill kill you myself Do you understand

CPT WEISS
I dont think either of us is going to
live long enou

He looks in the side view mirror as two Jeeps overtake his
truck They pull in front and then both stop blocking the road

CPT WEISS
Shit

COL STEINHAUSER
Let me handle this
EXT ROAD NEAR MILITARY CHECKPOINT - CONTINUOUS

The Guard gets out of the first Jeep along with several more
ARMED GUARDS He starts to walk over towards the trucks

Suddenly there is a loud WHOOM and a blinding white FLASH OF
LIGHT The men are knocked to the ground by a rush of air

As the light fades the Guard gets up to find that the first
truck has completely vanished along with the front half of the
second truck which has been cut clean in two

The crate inside the second truck is split in half exposing
some kind of complex device inside

HALF A DEAD SOLDIER sliced vertically from head to toe tumbles
out onto the road as the back half of truck collapses

CUT TO
EXT OUTSKIRTS OF DESERT TOWN - DAY

A twin-propellered Chinook helicopter swoops down and hovers
near a cluster of squat brown buildings

Black leather boots thunk down through the dust kicked up from
the downwash Seconds later the chopper’s gone and eight US
ARMY RANGERS are moving towards one of the buildings with the
alert confidence of a tested combat unit

SUPER NORTHERN IRAQ 2007

CPL KARL JENNER a heavy-set black man with a sniper rifle
slung across his back turns to the guy next to him

JENNER
Ali Any day of the week

DEACON
Are you fucking shitting me

PFC MATT DEACON’s a 24 year-old redneck who joined up as soon
as he was old enough to leave the family farm

SGT LEON PETROVSKY the tough grizzled bastard who’s seen
it all before rolls his eyes

PETROVSKY
Here we go

DEACON
Man Bruce Lee would snap both your
wrists before you can blink Ali’s just
a fat dude with the shakes

PFC SHAWN RAWLINS chimes in The baby of the group his
not good at hiding his hero worship for Jenner

RAWLINS
Ali’s fist is twice the size of Bruce
Lee’s head One good hit and that bitch
is going down right Karl

VALERIO
Pussy draft-dodger I could take him

BRICKLAND
You could take him out for dinner and a
BJ and buy him flowers after

Meet PFC GIUSEPPE VALERIO wannabe Italian stallion with a
‘Godfather’ complex and CPL

JOSH BRICKLAND the 65” tattooed beast of a man whos
always bringing him back down to Earth

VALERIO
Fuck you paisano I got something
Muhammad Ali don’t combat experience I
could take him

BRICKLAND
No you got a gun dipshit In a fair
fight no one stands a chance against the
champ Back in the day

PFC HENRY NORMAL grins One of two guys in the unit to
have gone to college he’s far too smart to be in this
conversation but he’s a born trouble-maker

NORMAL
You know Muhammad Ali’s a Muslim

JENNER
Shut the fuck up Normal

DEACON
Yeah what the fuck’s that got to do
with anything

NORMAL
I’m just saying

BRICKLAND
I think Normal got confused between Army
Rangers and Power Rangers and signed up
for the wrong one

VALERIO
Power Rangers ho

RAWLINS
That’s Thundercats

NORMAL
I would look good in a yellow jumpsuit

DEACON
Whaddaya think Sarge Bruce Lee
Muhammad Ali back in the day straight
up fist fight

PETROVSKY
I think you’re not twelve years old and
you should shut the fuck up and watch
where you’re going
NORMAL
(sarcastic)
Ooh what about Muhammad Ali vs Batman

VALERIO
How bout you Cap

The sudden silence tells us that no matter what the subject
every one of these guys listens to what CAPTAIN JACK LEVY the unit leader has to say

LEVY
I think Sergeant Petrovsky’s a smart man

DEACON
Aw come on

LEVY
You wanna know who wins It’s whoever’s
got nothing to lose
(they reach the building)
Alright guys business time

Levy nods as guard salutes him and leads the unit inside

INT FIELD HQ - CONTINUOUS
The men are led down a corridor and into the operations room

It’s a hive of activity -- maps and photographs covering the
walls live satellite images on computers screens the soft hum
of people getting things done with maximum efficiency

A tired and stressed officer MAJOR HURST (40s) greets Levy
with a handshake

MAJOR HURST
Jack glad you’re here You been briefed
yet

LEVY
Just the basics sir -- hostage
situation ticking clock

MAJOR HURST
Alright we’ve got fourteen hostages
all civilians part of a UN water
treatment programme being held in a one
story building about eight clicks north
of here
(indicates computer screen with
satellite thermal imaging)
(MORE)
MAJOR HURST (contd)
Satellite intel shows six captors and
weve still got a good read on all
fourteen hostages

LEVY
What’s that

He points to a dark grainy image on one of the screens The
hostages -- both men and women -- are visible tied up and
cowering in a corner

MAJOR HURST
They set up a web feed inside They say
they’re gonna start executing hostages
live on the internet if we don’t comply
with their demands by 4 pm today
which is in

LEVY
Sixty-two minutes Do we have photos of
all the hostages

MAJOR HURST
UN sent us copies of the personnel
files Corporal Riggs has them

LEVY
Jenner Rawlins Deacon start
memorizing faces Brickland Valerio
find someone here who knows about that
compound We roll in seventeen Normal
you’re on the drone

NORMAL
Yesssss

LEVY
(turns back to Hurst)
Captors what do we know Demands Can
we buy time

MAJOR HURST
They don’t talk much “Get out go home
disband the government convert to
Islam” Low on rhetoric high on
action

LEVY
Who’s this guy

He points to the screen with the web feed A tall ARAB MAN
(30s) strides back and forth in front of the hostages While
the other captors’ faces are all covered this man makes no
attempt to hide his sharp yet eerily expressionless features
MAJOR HURST
Assid Malouf the leader Lebanese
national we think he came in through
Iran and then Basra about--

LEVY
He’s not covered up

MAJOR HURST
He says he’s not afraid of us

NORMAL
He should be I’m afraid of us

Major Hurst casts him a quizzical look

LEVY
Quiet Normal What’s our Oh shit

Major Hurst turns and follows Levy’s gaze to the web feed Two

MASKED CAPTORS are pulling one of the hostages up and towards
the camera

Off to one side MALOUF has picked up a large curved SWORD and
is walking towards the terrified HOSTAGE

Silence falls over the Operations Room as everyone stops what
they’re doing and watches

MAJOR HURST
What’s he doing

The Hostage is thrown down and held roughly in place hands
behind his back neck exposed Malouf lines up the sword

MAJOR HURST
No no he’s early He’s an hour early
he can’t--

It looks surreal on the grainy screen with no sound as Malouf
brings down the sword on the Hostage’s neck

It takes a second hack to separate the head from the body
Everyone watches in stunned silence for a moment Then

LEVY
Move out

EXT FIELD HQ - MOMENTS LATER

The unit piles quickly into two Humvees which peel away in a
cloud of dust

Away to one side a small unmanned DRONE SPY PLANE takes off
into the air with a soft whine

INT FIRST HUMVEE (MOVING) - MOMENTS LATER

Normal sits in the back piloting the drone with a sophisticated
remote control A small LCD screen relays images from the
plane’s camera above

Petrovsky drives with Valerio navigating Deacon flicks through
photographs of the hostages then lands on one of Malouf the
terrorist leader

DEACON
You ever think it’s funny how you can
tell some people are evil just by
looking at them

NORMAL
(childlike whining)
Saaaaarge why do I always have to sit
at the kids’ table

PETROVSKY
Shut up and eat your vegetables

Levy’s voice crackles through on the radio

LEVY
(on radio)
Bravo Two what’s our ETA Leo

PETROVSKY
(into radio)
Bravo One about a click out should be
less than two minutes Cap

INT SECOND HUMVEE (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

Brickland drives while Levy Jenner and Rawlins study satellite
pictures of the compound

LEVY
(into radio)
Roger out
(MORE )

LEVY (contd)
(turns to Jenner points to
picture of compound)
If I can get you here you think you can
take out anyone who comes onto the roof

JENNER
Like fish in a barrel

INT FIRST HUMVEE (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS
Deacon’s still into his picture of Malouf
DEACON
I wanna get this guy myself double tap

on the back of his head see how evil
the motherfucker looks then

Normal looks up from the LCD screen -- showing an aerial view of
the road ahead -- and rolls his eyes He’s had enough
NORMAL

You know Ali didn’t fight in Vietnam
because he said he didn’t have a quarrel
with the Vietnamese

DEACON
What

NORMAL
You think you wanna get this guy Malouf
more than he wants to get you

VALERIO
What the fuck are you talking about

NORMAL
Look you and I just don’t care as much as
these guys sitting at home cooking up
bombs in their basements and all the
tanks and troop surges and stealth bombers
in the world aren’t gonna change that
It’s like the Cap said They’ve got
nothing to lose

VALERIO
If that’s what you think why the fuck
are you here

NORMAL
Oh I just came to party I dig chicks in
Burkas what can I say

DEACON
Asshole

PETROVSKY
That’s enough Normal

NORMAL
Hey I’m just
(glances at LCD screen)
AMBUSH TWO O’CLOCK

Petrovsky turns and sees a rocket streaking towards them from
the side of the road He slams on the brakes and yanks the wheel
round but he’s too late

BOOM

EXT ROADSIDE - CONTINUOUS

The rocket blows the swerving first Humvee onto its side The
second Humvee slams into it both skidding to a stop a few yards
down the road

A brief moment of silence Then Levy Brickland and Rawlins
jump out of the second Humvee and run to the upturned vehicle

Jenner stays in the truck sniper scope glued to his eye
scanning the side of the road

As the others start to help their comrades out of the upturned
Humvee the crackle of gunfire erupts from the side of the road
sending sparks zinging off the metal of the truck

LEVY
Down Down Covering fire north side

Back in the second Humvee Jenner calmly sights two insurgents by
the roadside and with two swift shots takes them both out

Meanwhile Levy and co have pulled the others from the flipped
Humvee Petrovsky is bleeding from a gash on the forehead
Normal and Valerio are banged up but basically OK

Deacon is unconscious his body a charred mangled and bloody
lump that seems to be missing several important pieces

LEVY
Jenner get on the horn we need a
medevac NOW Rawlins take --

BRICKLAND
INCOMING

Everyone kisses the dust as another rocket screams towards them
slamming into the upturned Humvee in a balloon of flame

Chaos erupts The unit take up defensive positions as bullets
rain in on them

Jenner manages to dive out of the second Humvee just as a third
rocket slams into it

The men are totally exposed forced to retreat towards the
burning vehicles which are their only cover

Jenner barks into the radio in between taking pot shots with his
sniper rifle

JENNER
Bravo Two Echo One mayday mayday

Despite being ambushed and vulnerable our guys know how to have
firefight and they’re putting down a lot of insurgents

But just as the tide seems to be turning in their favor there
comes a spine-chilling high-pitched whistling sound followed
by another

Everyone looks to the sky with dread

NORMAL
MORTAR

The first round lands with an Earth-shaking detonation about
twenty feet away decimating a large section of road and
showering our guys with dirt and concrete

There’s no way they’re going to survive a direct hit

As the second whistling sound gets louder time seems to slow
Levy looks up to see a black dot falling through the sky

directly above them getting closer closer

Seconds before impact there’s a loud WHOOM and a blinding white
FLASH OF LIGHT fills the screen taking us to

WHITE OUT

EXT DESERT - DAY
For a few seconds there’s nothing but silence and white

Slowly shapes start to emerge as if our eyes are adjusting from
looking into the sun

The shapes resolve themselves into the eight members of the
unit lying on the ground and the two mangled Humvees The men
start to stir Some of them get up dazed

BRICKLAND

What the fuck What the fuck
RAWLINS

Did they miss us

Jenner picks up the radio

JENNER
Bravo Two Echo One requesting medevac
over

Nothing but static The men are still trying to get their
bearings until something gets everyone’s attention

VALERIO (0C)
He’s dead

They turn to see Valerio crouched over Deacon’s crumpled form
The silence is broken after a beat by

NORMAL

Where did the mountains go
PETROVSKY

What
NORMAL

The buildings the fucking road Look

For the first time we get a wide angle on the scene They’re
standing in the middle of nowhere All traces of the town are
gone They are totally alone

It’s a desert landscape kind of like Northern Iraq but there’s
something weird about it something almost artificial

LEVY
(quietly)
Defensive positions
(nobody moves still baffled)
Now

The men fan out in a circle weapons pointed out Levy crouches
in the middle by Deacon’s body map and compass out

He lines up north with the map It shows roads rivers and
buildings which just aren’t there

He goes over to Jenner grabs the radio
LEVY
(into radio)
Bravo Two Echo One do you read over

Static He changes the frequency rattled but still calm

LEVY
Bravo Two Echo One do you read over

More static He tries more frequencies always the same

Meanwhile Normal spots something shiny off in the distance He
breaks out of formation and starts to walk towards it

VALERIO
Normal Get back here

Levy looks up from the radio

LEVY
Normal What are you doing

NORMAL
(still walking)
I see something Cap
Frustrated Levy looks at Normal then around at the men
LEVY
Okay Leo Rawlins stay here The rest

of you see what’s up

The men do as they’re told Levy lingers a moment frowning at
the gash on Petrovsky’s head

LEVY
Hey you okay

PETROVSKY
Been hurt worse clipping my toenails

LEVY
That doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence

PETROVSKY
Go

Levy gives a concerned half smile then heads out after Normal

EXT DESERTRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Normal reaches the shiny object near the edge of a ridge as the
rest of the group catches up with him

VALERIO
Hey dickless what the hell are you
Mamma mia

Normal turns around holding a short metal SWORD

BRICKLAND
Where’d you find that

NORMAL
It was just lying here on the ground

As Levy arrives and the men gather round to look at this strange
discovery Jenner wanders cautiously towards the edge of the
ridge surveying the area

LEVY
Let me see that

JENNER
Cap

Levy ignores Jenner and examines the sword

LEVY
Doesn’t look middle-eastern

JENNER
Cap

VALERIO
Aw shit look it’s got blood on it

JENNER
CAPTAIN
(everyone looks over)
I think you’d better take a look at
this

Levy and the others walk over to join Jenner on the ridge They
stop and stare in slack-jawed astonishment

BRICKLAND
What the fuck is going on

Strewn across the hillside below them are the bloodied corpses
of at least one hundred ROMAN SOLDIERS complete with swords
shields tasseled helmets and Russell Crowe sandals

EXT DESERTHILLSIDE - MOMENTS LATER

Weapons shouldered and ready the unit carefully pick their way
through what looks like the morgue at the Colosseum

Jenner passes a decomposing body peppered with BULLET HOLES

JENNER
They’ve been shot

VALERIO
Che puzza This shit stinks like
Brickland’s cock cheese

BRICKLAND
Mama Valerio didn’t seem to mind

Rawlins comes across a pile of fetid bodies and reels from the
stench He notices that several bodies have limbs heads or chunks
of torso missing with scorch marks on the wounds

RAWLINS

Goddamn

Normal unlike the others is staring straight up into the empty
blue sky Levy notices

LEVY
What’re you looking at

NORMAL
There’re no birds Bodies’ve obviously
been here for a while but there’s no
flies no birds It’s weird

Suddenly a figure lurches up from under the pile of bodies by
Rawlins and before he knows what’s happening he’s grabbed from
behind by a ROMAN CENTURION holding a sword to his throat

RAWLINS

Fuck

Everyone spins round weapons aimed but the Centurion has
Rawlins as a human shield there’s no shot

LEVY
Whoa everybody slow down okay

The Centurion shouts at them in some indecipherable language

RAWLINS
What’s he saying

LEVY
(lowering his gun)
Take it easy Rawlins

RAWLINS
Karl can you get him

Jenners pointing his sniper rifle rock steady at the Centurion
eye glued to the scope

JENNER
Just say the word cap Brother’s got a
big old head

The Centurion continues to shout

LEVY
Stay cool nobody moves until I say
Leo can you--

Suddenly the radio crackles to life A metallic voice

VOICE ON RADIO
Echo One Bravo Two be advised there
are enemy units in your area You are
ordered to engage and terminate over

PETROVSKY
The fuck was that

The Centurion continues to shout frantically as Levy slowly
reaches for the radio

LEVY
No sudden moves okay
(into radio)
Bravo Two Echo One we are off route
Request medevac over

VOICE ON RADIO
Echo One Bravo Two be advised there
are enemy units in your area You are
ordered to engage and terminate over

Levy frowns The Centurion is getting twitchy

LEVY
Bravo Two we are off the map repeat
off the map Request assistance over

The metallic voice comes back with exactly the same reply The
Centurion starts shouting again digging his sword a little
deeper into Rawlins’s neck

RAWLINS
Ahh Stop fucking around he’s gonna
kill me

JENNER

Cap I got him just say the--

VALERIO
Wait a minute wait a minute

LEVY
What

VALERIO
I think I think I understood something
he said Something Fire Black I

think he’s speaking Italian

The Centurion continues to ramble on Normal gets a funny look
on his face

NORMAL
Latin He’s speaking Latin
BRICKLAND
What like Ricky Martin
NORMAL
No fucktard like Spartacus Look at his
clothes
PETROVSKY

You speak Latin Normal

NORMAL
No but it’s kinda like Italian right
Valerio try talking wop to him

RAWLINS
Can you guys hurry the fuck up and do
something

LEVY
Valerio go

VALERIO
I dunno what Ah ok Hey Mi puoi
capire Parli italiano

The Centurion stops shouting and looks at Valerio quizzically

VALERIO
Noi siamo amici Vogliamo aiutarti
CENTURION
Amici
VALERIO
Amici Yes he understands ‘friend’ Uh
okay

(in Italian)
Please let him go We wont hurt you

The Centurion responds still tense

LEVY
Whatd he say

VALERIO
Uh something about We look like the
others

PETROVSKY
What others

Valerio and the Centurion talk again

VALERIO
I dunno it’s hard there’s words I don’t
know Something about black warriors and
sounded like Fire sticks

The Centurion points at Valerio’s rifle

LEVY
Guns Everybody lower your weapons
(quietly)
Not you Jenner
(to Centurion)
We just wanna talk okay Valerio

Valerio talks to the Centurion again Slowly cautiously the
Centurion lowers his sword and releases Rawlins who breathes
big sigh of relief

RAWLINS
Goddammit

The metallic voice on the radio is still repeating the same
phrase

VOICE ON RADIO
engage and terminate over

JENNER
Something’s not right here cap

Levy gives him a “no shit Sherlock” look as he clicks off the
radio

LEVY
Yes thank you Jenner
(walks to Centurion points
at himself)
Levy

He gestures to the Centurion “and you are” The Centurion
still looks at him suspiciously but he gets it

CENTURIONADEODATUS
Adeodatus

LEVY
Alright well now that we’re all
friends

Petrovsky taps him on the shoulder takes him aside

PETROVSKY
(quietly)
You know what you’re doing Jack I mean
I trust you we’ve seen our share of shit
but turning off the radio like that

LEVY
Here’s what I know Major Hurst does not
give the order to “engage and terminate”
and wherever we are is not where we were
when we got attacked These guys are
freaked out and I don’t blame them So
until I figure out where we are how we got
here and what’s going on I’m thinking the
best thing I can do is stay calm and
pretend that I’m going by the secret
officers’ handbook on what to do when you
find an army of massacred Roman soldiers
You okay with that

PETROVSKY
(wry grin)
Sounds like a plan

LEVY
Alright
(louder to the group)
Okay listen up guys we got

He is interrupted by the sound of a distant explosion followed
by the faint but unmistakable crackle of gunfire

Adeodatus tenses starts muttering under his breath

JENNER
Now what

EXT DESERT - MOMENTS LATER

The unit marches double time towards the gunfire Valerio jogs
with a reluctant-looking Adeodatus at his side

RAWLINS
(quietly)
Hey Karl what about Deacon and the
trucks

JENNER
Trucks ain’t much good to us now man

RAWLINS
And Deacon

JENNER
(pause)
We ain’t much good to him neither

Sgt Petrovsky calls out from the front of the group

PETROVSKY
Hold up hold up

He skids to a stop The rest come up level with him

NORMAL
Now there’s something you don’t see
every day

It looks as though a dead straight line has been drawn on the
ground a few feet in front of them stretching to the horizon in
both directions

On their side of the line is arid desert On the other side of
the line thick snowflakes silently fall to form a deep white
carpet on the ground

They stare bemused at this freakishly unnatural sight
BRICKLAND
Captain I’d like to formally request to
wake up now please

Normal cautiously steps over the line into the snow He gasps

NORMAL
Fuck

PETROVSKY
What

NORMAL
It’s cold

VALERIO

It’s snow dipshit

NORMAL
No I mean the air It’s cold here
(sticks his hand back over the
line to the desert side)
but here it’s still warm

One by one the others step into the snow

PETROVSKY
They got a manual for this Jack

RAWLINS
Jesus Christ This is fucked man it’s
summertime I thought Iraq was supposed
to be hot

NORMAL
I hate to break it to you Toto but I
don’t think we’re in Kirkuk anymore

LEVY
Let’s keep moving guys Weapons up
eyes peeled

As they push through a minor blizzard they’re able to make out
the source of the gunfire a few hundred yards away

VALERIO
Santa Maria

We fly off Levy’s blank stare of incomprehension through the
swirling snowflakes zooming across the frosted terrain to

EXT SNOWSCAPEBATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS

The twenty GERMAN WORLD WAR 2 SOLDIERS who vanished at the start
are grouped in defensive positions around their one-and-a-half
British army trucks

They are frantically trying to fight off an attacking horde of
at least one hundred VIKING WARRIORS

Were talking huge muscular men wrapped in furs and leather
armor and wielding swords axes and war-hammers that would take
two or three normal people just to lift off the ground

The Germans have guns and grenades but it takes at least a
couple of shots to put down a Viking and there are just so many
of them

Colonel Steinhauser moves smoothly among the Germans focussed
organized in total control

COL STEINHAUSER
Flank them on the right We have to
force them into a bottleneck

GERMAN SOLDIER
Colonel

Steinhauser turns just in time to dodge an axe as it whistles
past his face swung by an enormous broken-nosed brute He caps
him twice in the head before he can swing again

Captain Weiss also hops from group to group They are an
impressively slick unit

CPT WEISS
Man down on the Bren gun Voller watch
your back

A few yards away one of the Germans is hit in the face with a
war-hammer -- obliterating his jaw -- just as he prepares to lob
a grenade

The grenade rolls out of his hand EXPLODING and taking out
another German soldier and two Vikings in a shower of blood
dirt and snow

Steinhauser helps two soldiers reload a machine gun As soon as
they’re done they spray a river of hot lead into a line of
Vikings wiping them out

Weiss is knocked off his feet as the top half of a German body is
flung into him sending his pistol spinning into the snow

He desperately scrabbles around for a weapon as a particularly
bloodthirsty Norseman lumbers towards him grinning

Weiss comes up with a massive broadsword It’s so heavy he
totters backwards and forwards as he tries pathetically to swing
it

The Norseman laughs gleefully as he swats the sword from Weiss’s
grasp with a two-headed battle axe sending it flying through
the air until it skewers another Viking who was about to
decapitate a quivering German soldier

The quivering soldier’s friend turns to him ashen-faced

QUIVERING SOLDIERS FRIEND
You lucky bastard

Just as the Norseman attacking Weiss swings his axe for the
kill the his head explodes in a balloon of red

Weiss turns to see his filth-covered SERGEANT -- KRIEGER --
holding a rifle

SERGEANTSGT KRIEGER
Dont fuck about with them sir Kill
them

Weiss nods his thanks and retrieves his pistol

The battle is winding down now The Germans seem to be the
winners though their numbers have been halved from 20 to 10

Steinhauser walks among the bodies of dead and wounded Vikings
He kicks a nearby body It groans and stirs Without hesitation
Steinhauser shoots it in the head

He finds another less seriously wounded Viking with blonde
dreadlocks We’ll call him RASTA VIKING Rasta Viking grins up
at Steinhauser through a mouthful of blood

Steinhauser raises his pistol to shoot but

CPT WEISS
Sir
(comes running over)
We need answers Killing them isnt the
way
COL STEINHAUSER
We cant leave any alive its a danger
to the mission

His finger tightens on the trigger but before he can shoot

LEVY (0C)
Wait

The Germans look around to see that they are being covered by
the seven US Rangers and their M-16s

One of the Germans reaches for his rifle

JENNER
(eye to the scope)
Don’t do it

The German soldier freezes

COL STEINHAUSER
Who are these

SGT KRIEGER
(quietly)
Theyre not Vikings

LEVY
Put your hands in the air and step away
from your weapons

COL STEINHAUSER
Americans

SGT KRIEGER
What should we do

CPT WEISS
(drops his gun)
We dont have much of a choice

The Americans watch this exchange warily guns still aimed

RAWLINS
Is that German

NORMAL
Yeah but they’re wearing British
uniforms Old British uniforms

COL STEINHAUSER
(in English)
Please don’t shoot we won’t resist

The Americans are a little taken aback at his perfect English
and proper British accent

LEVY
Who are you
CPT WEISS
We--

He catches a look from Steinhauser

CPT WEISS
We were separated from our unit Could
you tell us Where are we

LEVY
We were hoping you’d be able to help us
out with that one

CPT WEISS
Oh I see You are American

LEVY
Yes And you

Before Weiss can answer Steinhauser steps forward

COL STEINHAUSER
We are British Royal Engineers We were
separated from the rest of our unit

NORMAL
Bullshit
(all eyes turn inquiringly as
he steps forward)
What year is it

PETROVSKY
Normal Can it with the zany questions

NORMAL
Nah fuck this Sarge Look English Bob
here speaks remarkably good German for a
limey so perhaps he can explain to our
Latin-speaking friend how come they just
got attacked by a horde of angry
Vikings cuz otherwise I’d say there are
very few zany questions I could ask
right now

LEVY
Agreed
(to Steinhauser)
What year is it

COL STEINHAUSER
We were under the impression that the
year is 1944

A moment of silence The Americans exchange curious looks Some
are starting to shiver in the cold though they keep their guns
trained on the Germans

LEVY
That’s interesting Because we were
under the impression that it’s 2007

Now it’s the German troops’ turn to gasp in surprise

LEVY
(to his men)
Lower your weapons
(to the Germans)
I’m Captain Jack Levy 14th US Army
Rangers from Baghdad Who are you

COL STEINHAUSER
Levy

Levy detects a hint of contempt in Steinhauser’s voice Weiss
looks at Levy for a long moment thinking before answering

CPT WEISS
My name is Hauptmann Dieter Weiss We
are a special reconnaissance unit from
Hamburg Germany

COL STEINHAUSER
(whispers )
Ill have you court-martialled

LEVY
So you’re German

COL STEINHAUSER
(before Weiss can answer)
Yes I apologize for lying to you but

obviously this is an unusual situation
We would appreciate any assistance you can
give us

The Americans and Germans stare in mutual suspicion at one
another shivering Finally Levy breaks it

LEVY
The men are freezing we need to get
them out of here That truck work

CPT WEISS
It won’t start

LEVY
Jenner Normal take a look

CPT WEISS
Thank you It’s nice to meet someone who
doesn’t want to kill us

BRICKLAND
(under his breath)
Early days yet pal

Normal wanders towards the sliced-in-half truck Steinhauser
tries to block his way

COL STEINHAUSER
There’s no way to get that one working

NORMAL
We might be able to use the parts

COL STEINHAUSER
I don’t think so

NORMAL
Well just let me look and --

COL STEINHAUSER
As a superior officer I must insist

NORMAL
(pats him on the shoulder)
Youre not a superior officer you’re a
member of a defeated army but nice try

COL STEINHAUSER
(taken aback)
What Deafeated

He looks like he’s going to throw up

NORMAL
Well duh Didn’t you notice how none of
us is speaking German
(Weiss and Krieger also look like
they’ve been gut-punched)
Sorry guys you came second So close

EXT SNOWSCAPE - LATER

Jenner and Normal are working on the main truck’s engine
cannibalizing parts from the other truck half

Krieger supervises as German troops transfer the sliced crate
from the crippled truck to the main one Petrovsky approaches

PETROVSKY
What’s in the box

SGT KRIEGER
Nothing that concerns you

PETROVSKY
You guys speak very good English

SGT KRIEGER

(edgy)
So what

PETROVSKY
Just saying
(sees Steinhauser standing
alone away from everybody)
He always this moody

SGT KRIEGER
He just found out everything he was
fighting for was for nothing

PETROVSKY
Oh yeah no genocide no Aryan super-
nation no shiny black knee-high boots
Pass me the fucking kleenex I don’t envy
you having to take orders from a Nazi

SGT KRIEGER
Colonel Steinhauser is a first class
officer

PETROVSKY
My mother-in-law’s a first class bitch
but I wouldn’t follow her into battle

SGT KRIEGER
Youre a lucky soldier if you agree with
everything you’re told to fight for
(starts to walk away then)
But I would follow the Colonel anywhere

Krieger leaves Petrovsky pondering this and wanders off to sit
with his men passing Valerio Rawlins and Brickland who are
trying to patch up Rasta Viking and Adeodatus’s wounds

Rasta Viking bellows in pain as Rawlins pulls too tightly

RAWLINS
Sorry sorry sorry

VALERIO
(patching up Adeodatus)
What a fucking cry-baby

The Viking picks up Brickland’s rifle and peers down the barrel

BRICKLAND
(snatches it back)
Whoa You gotta be careful with that
man you’ll blow your face off

VALERIO
Here hit of morphine should calm him
down

The Viking flinches and grunts as Valerio sticks the needle in
but after a second his features relax into a smile

VALERIO
Yeah you like that
(to Adeodatus in Italian)
You want some too

ADEODATUS
(in Latin)
What is it

VALERIO
(winks )
Trust me

The Viking giggles and starts chattering away happily He gives
Rawlins a friendly pat on the back almost knocking him over

BRICKLAND
Congratulations Valerio you just
created the first Viking junkie

Meanwhile Levy walks over to the truck to check on Jenner and
Normal

LEVY
How’s it going

NORMAL
I don’t trust ‘em Cap There’s
something in that crate they don’t want
us to see

LEVY
Just get the truck working

He turns around to see Weiss standing there

CPT WEISS
It was the eastern front wasn’t it

LEVY
I’m sorry

CPT WEISS

The war Why we lost I knew we shouldn’t
have invaded Russia He spread us too
thinly I could feel we were losing Lots
of us could But some

(he glances at Steinhauser)
--just couldn’t let go They had given
too much

Levy notices that Jenner and Normal have stopped work and are
watching Weiss He gestures for them to get back to it and leads
Weiss a few steps away

LEVY
It must be hard to fight when you
think you’re going to lose

CPT WEISS
Are you speaking from sympathy or
experience

(Levy smiles wryly)
The Fuhrer is an evil greedy man We
deserve to lose I just wish I’d got my
wife and son away to Britain or America
before the war really got going It wasn’t
worth their lives

Levy looks at him sadly but can’t think of anything to say
CPT WEISS
Do you ever get the feeling you’re
fighting on the wrong side
Levy thinks for a moment
LEVY
The people I’m fighting kill
indiscriminately We don’t In theory

anyway I try to hold on to that

They both turn as the truck behind them sputters to life

EXT TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

The American and German troops along with Adeodatus and the
Viking pile into the back of the truck

BRICKLAND
(to Normal and Jenner)
You guys couldn’t get this thing going
any quicker I get any colder my dick’s
gonna drop off

NORMAL
As women all over the world breathe a
sigh of relief

Valerio helps the fur-clad Viking into the truck

VALERIO
Hey Cap how come we don’t get fur coats
like this guy

PETROVSKY
Shut your trap Valerio Half the guys
in Baghdad don’t have body armor and you
want a scarf and mittens

Levy opens the cab door to find Steinhauser behind the wheel

LEVY
Sorry Fritz but I think I’1l drive

Steinhauser flushes with anger but slides over

IE TRUCK - MOVING - LATER

The atmosphere in the cab of the truck is a couple of degrees
colder than the arctic landscape outside

COL STEINHAUSER
Do you have any idea where you’re going

LEVY
Yes Forward

CPT WEISS
What’s that

Indistinct shapes loom out of the blizzard in front of them
Suddenly the truck passes over another dividing line and the
snow disappears replaced by a bombed-out urban landscape like
something out of a futuristic Saving Private Ryan

Levy slows to manoeuvre around the new obstacles

LEVY
Jesus

CPT WEISS
Is this 2007

LEVY
No I I don’t know

There’s a banging on the back of the cab from the rear of the
truck Petrovsky’s muffled voice shouts

PETROVSKY (0S)
Something’s coming

Levy slows the truck to a halt The three men in the cab crane
their necks to see out the windows

COL STEINHAUSER
I don’t--

There’s a deafening ROAR and what looks like a FLYING TANK --
think Christian Bale’s Batmobile meets the ship from The Matrix --
streaks past overhead smoke billowing out the back

CPT WEISS
Holy Shit

As the ‘tank’ careens through the sky we can see that it is
being attacked by three huge ROBOTS clinging to the hull like
spiders

The robots are about eight feet tall and look like what would
happen if Iron Man had a one night stand with a Terminator They
pummel mercilessly on the armor-plating of the tank

Levy slams the truck in gear and races off in pursuit as the
tank zig-zags through the air apparently trying to throw the
robots off

CPT WEISS
What are you doing

LEVY
Following it

COL STEINHAUSER
Good we need answers go go

The tank swerves into a tight curve swooping back over the
truck and then out in front of it again

As it passes them an escape hatch EXPLODES outwards taking one
of the robots with it A FIGURE in a black suit and helmet bails
out landing a hundred feet ahead

CPT WEISS
What was that

One of the remaining robots leaps after this escapee
Levy pushes the truck forwards as fast as it will go

The remaining robot enters the stricken craft through the newly-
opened escape hatch and the tank suddenly lurches towards the
ground and disappears from view

On the ground the black-suited figure is cornered by the
advancing robot as the truck approaches Levy makes a split-
second decision revs the engine and PLOUGHS into the robot
knocking it away from its target

He skids the truck to a stop and leaps out running to the
figure The Rangers pile out of the back weapons ready

A few Germans start to get out too but Steinhauser holds a hand
up to stop them

COL STEINHAUSER
(quietly)
Stay here cover them

While Levy runs to the black figure the Rangers form a
defensive line between them and the robot

The robot stands up to its full height It’s a fearsome sight
It looks at the Rangers seems to think for a moment then turns
and runs off in the opposite direction

RAWLINS
What the fuck was that

Adeodatus grabs Valerio and talks quickly and quietly ashen-
faced as he points at the black-suited figure

PETROVSKY
What’s he saying

VALERIO
He says that’s one of the guys who
massacred his army

The Rangers all tense up guns aimed at the black-suited figure
who walks calmly towards them

LEVY
Stay where you are

The black-suited figure stops and pulls off its helmet to reveal
a beautiful SHAVEN-HEADED WOMAN (late 20s)

BRICKLAND
Whoa

She speaks with a crystal-cut British accent her voice full of
confidence and authority

WOMAN
Hello boys What’re you then American
early 21st century Afghanistan Iraq
Syria
(they just stare at her)
Don’t answer all at once

LEVY
Who are you

WOMAN
(sticks out a hand)
Corporal Becca Harris TelePhar security
out of Calgary 2156

LEVY
(shakes her hand staring)
Jack I mean Captain Levy US Army
Rangers Iraq 2007

PETROVSKY
(nodding at Adeodatus)
Jack

LEVY
(snaps out of it)
Right This man says you destroyed his

unit

WOMANBECCA
Oh Okay Sorry about that Nothing
personal

VALERIO

That’s it ‘Nothing personal’

BECCA
How long have you lot been in Arena

LEVY
Arena

BECCA
Not long I take it Well good luck to
you

And with that she turns and starts away towards her APC

VALERIO
Hey you slaughtered this guy’s entire
army

NORMAL

And in case you didn’t notice we just
saved your life

BECCA
Well gosh haven’t you just got more
balls than a Wimbledon final I must
remember to give you all blowjobs next
time I see you

COL STEINHAUSER
(points his pistol at her)
We need answers What’s going on where
are we

She stops walking sighs impatiently

BECCA
This is Arena It’s a game The rules
are simple fight or die If you don’t
fight the robots come If you try and
escape the robots come If the robots
come you run away or you die Usually
both Did you get a message yet

LEVY
What

BECCA
Something from your base telling you
there’s enemy around and to kill
everything you see

Levy turns on the radio Immediately a familiar metallic voice
cuts through the static but this time with a slightly different
message

VOICE ON RADIO
Echo One Bravo Two engage and terminate
all enemy units When you have destroyed
seven units we will send you home over

CPT WEISS
We got something like that too

LEVY
Wait a minute it didn’t say that last
time about the seven armies thing

BECCA
We got that one after we won our first
fight -- kill seven armies and you get

to go home Congratulations boys
youve been initiated

COL STEINHAUSER
How long have you been here

She looks him up and down

BECCA
Long enough to know dead meat when I see
it

NORMAL

But where are we When are we

BECCA
When I don’t know Where

She grabs a grenade off Normal’s belt pulls the pin and hurls
it high into the air

They watch it arc up for about fifty feet until oddly it
bounces off the sky right before it EXPLODES

For a couple of seconds they see a shimmering translucent screen
stretched over some kind of scaffolding above them

The screen flickers and then the sky image returns

LEVY
Jesus We’re inside something

COL STEINHAUSER
What is it why are we here

BECCA
Beats the shit out of me mate But
somebody’s pulling the strings so they’d
be the person to ask

LEVY
Pulling the strings

BECCA
There are armies from all different
times Those with weaker technology get
more manpower and some kind of home
field advantage -- terrain weather
whatever Somebody’s trying make the
fights longer fairer

CPT WEISS
(to Levy)
We fought the Vikings in the snow

Levy nods thoughtfully

BECCA
Oh shit Everybody back to the truck now

CPT WEISS
What’s going on

BECCA
Somebody’s coming look

As she double-times it back to the truck the soldiers look
around confused Then they notice

The piles of rubble seem to be melting On closer inspection
they’re disintegrating dissolving back into the ground

The men stare around dumbfounded as the landscape literally
disappears before their eyes Normal crouches and looks as small
green dots start to appear on the ground

NORMAL
You see this Cap

The dots turn into blades of grass growing out of the ground at
an alarming rate Within seconds the whole area is filled with
waist-deep grass and it’s still growing

LEVY
Back to the truck Move move

By the time everyone’s figured out that they should have been
paying attention to Becca in the first place the grass is over
their heads -- they can’t see each other or the truck

JENNER
Where am I going

PETROVSKY (0S)
This way

JENNER

RAWLINS (0S)

PETROVSKY (0S)
Follow my voice

There’s a strange whistling sound followed by a scream Then
more whistling noises getting closer together

We find Normal fighting his way through the grass until he
almost trips over something

NORMAL
What the

He looks down to see a GERMAN SOLDIER writhing on the ground
with an ARROW through his neck blood pouring onto the ground
his mouth open in a silent scream

NORMAL
Oh fuck

More screams fill the air along with the sound of the truck
engine firing up Normal sprints towards the latter sound as
arrows whistle past him through the grass

NORMAL
Shit wait wait

He finally makes it to the truck A German soldier reaches down
from the back to help him up and in

NORMAL
Thanks

The German soldier is about to reply when an arrow THUNKS into
his right eye socket

NORMAL
Jesus Christ

BRICKLAND
That everyone

All the Americans Adeodatus the Viking and a handful of
Germans -- including Sergeant Krieger -- are there Petrovsky

INT TRUCK CAB - CONTINUOUS

Steinhauser Weiss and Becca are crammed in next to Levy who
guns the engine and accelerates away He glances in the side
view mirror

IN MIRROR following the flattened path left by the truck gallop
at least fifty SIOUX INDIANS on horseback

The mirror SHATTERS as it’s hit by an arrow
Becca leans out the passenger side to look back

BECCA
Sioux Indians early nineteenth century

An arrow whistles towards Becca’s face but she snatches it out
of the air with superhuman reflexes

The men stare at her as she leans back inside

This thing should be able to outrun
horses right

EXT TRUCK - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

An arrow pierces one of the rear tires blowing it out The
truck fishtails carving a zig-zag through the grass

Brickland and Valerio are leaning out the back of the truck
firing on the Sioux The jolt of the blowout almost knocks
Brickland out the back

An arrow thunks into his shoulder but he’s protected by his
flack jacket He looks at the arrow sticking in him

How much fucking longer you gonna be

SGT KRIEGER
Id be quicker if I didn’t keep stopping
to talk to you

Sioux arms flail through a tear in the canvas -- grab Valerio
round the neck

at the elbow He grins at Valerio

A tomahawk smashes through Steinhauser’s window Two painted
Sioux glare at him

The closest jumps onto the truck Steinhauser shoots him
casually in the face and he falls away He blasts at the second
but misses

The Indian throws himself at the truck knocking the gun out of
Steinhauser’s hand Levy swerves left and right to shake the
attacker off It doesn’t work

BECCA
I’1l get him

She grabs the window frame and in one fluid movement swings
herself out feet first kicking the attacking Sioux off

He falls and is trampled by the pursuing horses

the truck where she starts removing war-painted attackers with
skill and ease

He empties his pistol into the roof A body slams down onto the
hood disappearing under the front with a bump and crunch

Suddenly Levy’s window explodes Hands reach in thrashing
around with a long knife

Levy struggles to fight off the attacker while keeping the truck
under control but he’s pulled halfway out of the broken window

The door screeches and swings open Levy and the Sioux hanging
from it

CLOSE UP the door’s top hinge begins to come away from the
bodywork of the truck

The truck skids round ninety degrees so the full arsenal in the
back is pointed through the burnt hole in the canvas

By the time the truck has ground sideways to a halt half a ton
of hot lead has been unleashed upon the Sioux

None of them remain standing

Levy leans over the wheel and blows out a huge puff of air
Weiss slaps his back

Steinhauser stone-faced reaches out a hand Levy pauses then
shakes it They exchange a thin smile

EXT APC - EMPTY LANDSCAPE - LATER

The futuristic Armored Personnel Carrier (the ‘flying tank’)
sits in a small crater in an otherwise unnaturally featureless

landscape ominously silent

Behind it a deep trough has been carved in the ground by its
crash landing

soldiers cautiously emerge

here

The Americans and Germans cautiously hang back guns at the
ready as Becca strides over to the APC and crawls in through
the escape hatch

A few moments of silence Tense faces scan the horizon

One of them is Normal’s As his gaze passes over the crash-path
of the APC he pauses tilts his head

Normal what you got

Normal ignores him and starts to wander off

wish hed stop doing that

jump They turn to see Becca kicking open the crumpled main
entrance hatch

She’s dead

INT CRASHED APC - MOMENTS LATER

Becca leads Levy and Jenner into the stricken craft dimly lit
by red emergency lights Steinhauser and Weiss follow

It’s the size of a small bus Broken futuristic consoles and
instruments line the walls

There are scorch marks and scratches around the interior and a
DEAD BODY lies crumpled in one corner

CPT WEISS
How many of you were there originally

BECCA
Five We broke the rules tried to get out
by blowing a hole in the wall but the
robots came Sims and I You wanna see

What

Becca goes to the body -- SIMS -- in the corner and takes off
its helmet revealing another shaven-headed woman (20s)

BECCA
Here

She puts the helmet over an uncertain Levy’s head We go to his
POV as images start to play on the inside of the visor
EXT MEDITERRANEAN LANDSCAPE - ARENA - DAY

Were seeing Cloverfield-style shaky-cam images recorded from a
camera in Sims’s helmet

We run along with four other BLACK-SUITED FIGURES two men
(BATES and WARREN) one woman (VICKERS) and Becca

BATES
Who’s got the detonators

BECCA
I do here

She hands something to one of the other Figures who crouches
and plants a bomb in the middle of the ground

VICKERS
Okay eight seconds go go

They all run away from the bomb We turn back to see a huge
EXPLOSION tear a hole in the horizon -- they have punched through
a wall made to look like the landscape goes on forever

What do you see

WARREN
It looks like--

BECCA
INCOMING THREE O’CLOCK

The helmet-cam turns to see five ROBOTS charging towards them

BATES
Back to the ship

In the shaky images recorded as Sims sprints back to the APC we
catch glimpses of Becca running alongside her and the robots
attacking the three unit members behind them

One is punched in the head and sent crashing into the wall

We hear screaming coming through the helmet intercoms

Ahead Becca makes it into the APC and reaches back to help pull
Sims in just as a robotic foot SLAMS into the hull

Ah my leg

We tumble into the APC as the hatch slams shut

Few clicks north-west But it’s guarded

CPT WEISS
What does it lead to

Becca goes to one of the consoles and hits a few buttons The
screen is cracked but after whacking the panel a couple of
times a complex 3-D building schematic appears

BECCA

We used our sensors to map what’s outside
There’s a large complex This big dome
thing is us There’s another smaller one
over here then a bunch of smaller rooms
and tunnels We think this

(points at screen)
-is the way out of the whole thing But who
knows We were just trying to find someone
who knows what the fuck’s going on

The cogs in Steinhauser’s head are turning

COL STEINHAUSER
Are there any weapons here we can use

BECCA
Just have a couple of P-grenades

COL STEINHAUSER
P-grenade

She takes a futuristic grenade from her belt

You can set the timer manually and
choose a blast size anywhere from little
pop to big boom Oh yeah and there’s
also the nuke

LEVY and JENNER
Nuke

Becca goes to a busted storage unit and produces what looks like
a large football with a digital console and strap

JENNER
That’s a nuclear bomb

BECCA
All the cool kids have one

COL STEINHAUSER
Uranium or plutonium

BECCA
Plutonium why

COL STEINHAUSER
What’s the yield

BECCA
About two hundred mega-to Wait a
minute you guys are from 1944 right

couple of German troops -- is dragging the mangled remains of
the robot Becca crippled by blowing out the escape hatch

The Viking frowns then smacks Normal’s hand knocking him clean
over to the ground

JENNER
(seeing the mangled robot)
Whoa what’d we miss

SGT KRIEGER
(to Steinhauser)
One of the Americans found the remains
of this machine sir

COL STEINHAUSER
Leave them Something has come up

Levy brushes past him headed for the truck followed by Becca
and Weiss Petrovsky joins them as Steinhauser and Krieger hurry
along behind

PETROVSKY
What’s going on

LEVY
Our friends have been holding out on us

The reach the truck A lone GERMAN SOLDIER sits in the back
guarding the sliced-in-half crate

LEVY
Open it

The German Soldier looks at Weiss uncertain

CPT WEISS
Do it

The Soldier pulls off the lid revealing a large NUCLEAR BOMB
Part of the bomb has been sliced away like the crate

PETROVSKY
Jesus

COL STEINHAUSER
The detonators are damaged but the core
still seems to be intact

LEVY
What does that mean

COL STEINHAUSER
It means we have forty pounds of plastic
explosive with a lump of plutonium in the
middle It’s basically just a large
conventional bomb at this point

PETROVSKY
So are we all radioactive now

COL STEINHAUSER
The radiation can’t penetrate your skin

BECCA
But how Germany didn’t have the bomb

Weiss opens his mouth but stops looks at Steinhauser

COL STEINHAUSER
Go ahead Tell them No more lies We
need to work together

CPT WEISS
It was a secret project Almost no one
knows about it even in the military We
were to smuggle the weapon to London and
detonate it

There’s a long silence as everyone stares at the weapon Then

LEVY
Close it up We need to get moving

He starts to walk off

PETROVSKY
(quietly)
Uh Jack I think some of the guys are
kinda hungry It’s been a long day
yknow

Levy looks around at the men wiping sweat from their faces
drinking from canteens -- clearly exhausted

LEVY
Right Thanks Leo
(calls out)
Okay fellas chow time

A small cheer erupts from the group

MATCH CUT TO

INT CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

We are watching the scene on some kind of futuristic 3-D screen
Levy by the truck Normal with the mangled robot

Two strange throaty voices are in the room speaking some
unrecognizable language

VOICE 1 (0C)
Theyre not fighting Theyre working
together

VOICE 2 (0C)
For the moment Send another opponent
Whos closest

Slender fingers glide over an elaborate console

EXT NEAR CRASHED APC - LATER

Clusters of men sit around eating from ration packs A few
Germans are starting to mingle with the Americans now chatting
making jokes

Normal tinkers with the busted-up robot As he digs around with
a wrench a huge three-foot-long BLADE shoots out of the
robot’s arm with a SHUNK

NORMAL
Sweet

We drift over to find Valerio and Rawlins sitting with Adeodatus
and the Viking The Americans are clearly having fun teaching
their new friends English

RASTA VIKING
(slowly sounding the words out)
Yo mama’s got a glass eye vith
a fish in it

Valerio and Rawlins collapse in laughter and high five

RAWLINS
Okay okay make him go

Valerio says something to Adeodatus in Italian

ADEODATUS
(again parrot-fashion)
Yo mamus got a peg leg wit a kick-
stand

More laughter
VALERIO
Okay all together now this time right
Ready

He waves his hands like he’s conducting an orchestra

VALERIO RAWLINS ADEODATUS and VIKING
Fuck you you fucking fuck

They all laugh but the smile falls from Adeodatus’s lips as his
eyes wander over to see Becca talking to Levy

LEVY
I don’t trust him

BECCA
Who Colonel Klink

She looks over to where Steinhauser and Krieger are talking in
quiet urgent German

BECCA
You shouldn’t Those two have been
yakking away about nukes and all the fun
things they could do with them for the
last half hour

LEVY
How do you know

BECCA

Tactical bionic enhancement

(off his questioning look)
Implants

(his eyes instinctively flick

to her chest)
Nooo not that kind Computer chips
bone grafts I’ve been ‘upgraded’

LEVY
From what
BECCA
(grins)
From you
LEVY

How do you mean

BECCA
I can see better see at night hear
better filter sound I’m smarter
stronger faster better reflexes

LEVY
And you can understand German

BECCA
I can speak read and write any language
that has been spoken on Earth for the last
3000 years Well 3000 years from 2156
Fuck knows where we are now

LEVY
Wow

BECCA

I know I’ve probably got a bigger cock
than you as well

(they both laugh)
Anyway if you’re worried about the
Germans Ill keep an eye on them make
sure they play nice Or I could just
snap their necks now and save us all the
anxiety

Levy smiles then grows serious for a moment

LEVY
I’m sorry about your unit

BECCA
Don’t be We weren’t exactly close

LEVY
Don’t take this the wrong way but how come
you haven’t tried to kill us I mean with
all those enhancements it can’t be too hard
to beat what was it seven armies

BECCA
I don’t want to play the game anymore We
beat four armies -- four big armies but

just guys with swords and spears you know
It didn’t feel right It felt like murder
(MORE )

BECCA (contd)
So we tried to break out We’d Well Id
had enough Bates -- my CO -- would have
happily carried on Enjoys killing a bit
too much in my opinion Still that’s the
world we grew up in I suppose

LEVY
What’s it like where you’re from

BECCA
Hmmm Well I think it could be best
described as a ‘fucking shithole’

LEVY
What no flying cars and x-ray specs

BECCA
Oh no we’ve got all that but pretty much
the entire world is at war with each
other and nobody really knows why

LEVY
What do you mean nobody knows

BECCA

(sighs wearily)
Most armies have been privatized and bought
by multinats -- corporations -- so there’s
not a whole lot of political or religious
ideology about I mean I kill for a
pharmaceutical company for fuck’s sake
Large chunks of Africa and Asia are totally
uninhabitable which means there’s a
shitheap of people and not much space for
them to live in Oh and here’s one you’1l
like being a man you’d have an eighty-five
percent chance of being randomly selected
for castration at birth

LEVY
Well that sounds like something to look
forward to

BECCA
You wanna see

She pulls what looks like a folded sheet of plastic from her
pocket and hands it to Levy

LEVY
What’s this

BECCA
It’s a Knowledge Unfold it

He does A touch screen image appears on the plastic

LEVY
What do I do

BECCA
Just type in what you want to know
Like I dunno
(she takes it touch-types)
‘War 2156’ There you go you can
see the future

Levy stares at what resembles a very advanced Wikipedia page By
touching the screen he can scroll through text maps
photographs He’s totally engrossed

BECCA
(almost to herself)
You know back in the good old days if
you were a king and you wanted to go to
war you picked up a sword and fought
(beat)
I don’t even know who my king is anymore

LEVY
(reading from screen)
Son of a bitch

BECCA
What

LEVY
Son of a motherfucking cocksucking
bitch Look at this

He points at the screen It’s a picture of a familiar-looking
ARAB MAN with sharp but eerily expressionless features

BECCA
Assid Malouf Not a nice man So

Levy gets up and runs over to Petrovsky with the screen

LEVY
Leo You have to see this

Petrovsky is sitting eating ration-pack baked beans
PETROVSKY

(mouth full)
What

Levy hands him the screen Petrovsky reads for a minute then
spits out his food

PETROVSKY
(standing up)
What the hell is this thing

LEVY

It’s Malouf the guy with the hostages
He’s the next fucking Bin Laden Look at
this shit chemical attack on the Berlin
metro 2010 bombs the Sears Tower 2012
bombs the Houses of Parliament 2012 the
US and Britain go to war with Pakistan
2013 nuclear strike on--

PETROVSKY
Wait wait wait slow down what am I
looking at

LEVY
It’s the future Leo This guy This guy
we were supposed to get is gonna start
World War 3 do you--

NORMAL
(approaching)
Cap

LEVY
Not now Normal

NORMAL
I think you--

LEVY
Not n

He suddenly notices that it’s gotten darker All the other
soldiers are on their feet looking around warily as the air
thickens into a mist

VALERIO
Oh fuck

JENNER
(grabbing rifle)
Here we go again

Partially obscured by the thick haze huge broad oak trees
suddenly shoot up out of the ground around them

RAWLINS
Cap Whadda we do

Steinhauser starts calmly giving orders in German to his five
remaining men They grab their guns and make ready

LEVY
Eyes open Nobody shoots till I say

The Rangers lock and load side-by-side with the Germans

COL STEINHAUSER

Perhaps I should move my men into a

right flanking position We don’t have

to be the aggressors but it would be

prudent to keep our options open
BECCA

I’ve got to agree with Bratwurst on this

one Jack

LEVY
Fine but we don’t attack first agreed

The Viking readies his massive broadsword with a grim smile

BRICKLAND
There

He points at vague silhouettes moving off to one side
One of the Germans mutters terrified under his breath

The shapes advance until we can just about make them out then
stop in a long line

The line is composed of about twenty MEDIEVAL KNIGHTS on
horseback -- clad in full gleaming suits of armor -- and
accompanied by another 200 FOOTSOLDIERS in chain mail carrying
swords spears bows and arrows

A few unbearably tense seconds of silence tick by Each side
regards the other unmoving

Finally one of the knights on horseback pulls his sword out of
its sheath with a loud SHHHHIIING

One of the Germans cocks his rifle

COL STEINHAUSER
No

and FIRES but the bullet just zings off the knight’s armor

The Knight (early 40s) raises his visor and looks curiously at
the new dent in his breastplate before turning to his opponents
and shouting out in a deep booming voice

KNIGHT
I am Sir Guy de Villiers I claim these
lands in the name of King Richard Let no
man who is not loyal to his name remain
alive on the field of battle this day

As he raises his sword in the air his men cheer loudly On the
flanks of the line ARCHERS notch arrows onto their bowstrings
and pull them taut ready to fire

BRICKLAND
Can we shoot now Cap

Levy looks around at his men the Germans the medieval horde
And then he drops his rifle and strides out into the space
between them hands in the air

LEVY
Stop

Both sides watch in curious silence

LEVY
We don’t want to fight We are not your
enemies
(to the Rangers)
Lower your weapons

BECCA
Um Jack

LEVY
Now

The Rangers reluctantly obey The Germans watch nervously guns
still aimed

COL STEINHAUSER
Do as he says

They lower their weapons

KNIGHTSIR GUY
Who addresses us

LEVY
My name is Captain Jack Levy and I’ve had
enough killing for one day You are not our
enemy and we are not yours

(MORE)

LEVY (contd)
Weve all been taken from our homes and
brought here to kill for reasons none of us
understand Someone is manipulating us
Someone is using us all for their own
agenda That someone is my enemy And he
should be yours as well So make a choice
do we die here now for no reason Or do
we unite and fight that enemy together

Another tense silence as Sir Guy ponders this Finally

SIR GUY
Very well

He signals to the archers to lower their bows Everybody lets
out a big sigh of relief

Becca pats Levy on the shoulder

BECCA
Nice speech

LEVY
Thanks

She gives him a lingering look in the eyes smiling slightly

BECCA
You’re a good guy aren’t you

LEVY
I dunno I hope so
BECCA
Yeah you are

(beat)
Probably just got us all killed though

LEVY
What

Sir Guy strides over and grasps Levy’s shoulder in an old-timey
gesture of respect

SIR GUY
There is truth in your words Captain
Jacklevy however strangely you may speak
them Verily am I confounded by these
perverse environs and our presence herein
I beg to ask whence did you come to arrive
thus before our army

LEVY
Ummm yeah Right Listen I just need
to--

He turns to find Steinhauser there

COL STEINHAUSER
That was a bold move Captain But
sometimes words are stronger than bullets
I was impressed

Levy is a bit thrown by Steinhauser being nice to him

LEVY
Uh Thanks

Becca clears her throat loudly Everybody turns

BECCA
I hate to interrupt the man-love but
were in a bit of a pickle

Sir Guy suddenly notices Becca’s a woman bows deeply

SIR GUY
My lady Forgive my distraction

LEVY
(ignoring Sir Guy)
What do you mean pickle

As if in answer to this deep thumping sounds and weird
mechanical noises echo through the mist towards them

PETROVSKY
What’s that

There’s a nervous murmuring from some of the medieval
footsoldiers on the far flank A couple start to run towards our
group terror on their faces

BECCA
I told you the rules
(a scream in the distance)
Fight or die

As more terrified soldiers flee two hulking eight-foot-tall
ROBOTS emerge through the mist

ROBOT ONE grabs a passing FOOTSOLDIER picks him up and flings
him into a broad oak tree with bone-shattering force killing
him instantly

RAWLINS
Holy shit

SIR GUY
What in God’s name are those creatures

LEVY
Everyone back to the truck

One of the Knights on horseback charges towards ROBOT TWO sword
drawn but is brutally CLOTHES-LINED to the ground

A few of the braver footsoldiers try to attack with swords and
spears In response long blades -- like the one Normal saw
earlier -- extend from the robots’ arms hacking the
footsoldiers to pieces

The robots are blocking the path from our guys to the truck
LEVY
Down the left flank Brickland Rawlins

covering fire

BECCA
No wait

But it’s too late Brickland and Rawlins shoulder their rifles
take aim and let out two quick bursts at Robot One

The bullets bounce off the metal beast in a shower of sparks
Robot One immediately spins around to face these new attackers
The blade on its right arm retracts with a CHUNK and is
replaced immediately by a three-barreled MACHINE GUN

Robot One fires Before he even knows what’s happened Brickland
is ripped to bloody pieces by a hail of hot lead

RAWLINS
No

BECCA
Don’t shoot at them

Meanwhile limbs are flying as Robot Two slices and dices its way
through the medieval forces

One of the Archers fires off an arrow at Robot Two The robot
snatches it out of the air spins it round and hurls it back at
the Archer with such force that it shatters his kneecap coming
out the back of his leg

The Archer drops to the ground screaming in agony

EXT CLUMP OF TREES - WOODLAND - CONTINUOUS

The Americans Germans and Sir Guy manage to edge closer to the
truck by taking cover behind a string of trees but now there’s
no way past Robot One

JENNER
Shit

CPT WEISS
We need a diversion

SIR GUY
I will go

LEVY

Thanks but you’re not gonna break any
land speed records in that tin man suit

SIR GUY
I cannot leave my men to fight and die
while I flee

RAWLINS
Ill go Cap
BECCA
Ill help you
SIR GUY
My lady I--
BECCA

Don’t even think about arguing with me

LEVY
All right We’ll try to cover you On
the count of three One

NORMAL

Wait a sec Cap Sarge gimme the RPG
PETROVSKY

What
NORMAL

Just give it okay

Petrovsky takes a compact disposable ROCKET LAUNCHER from his
pack and grudgingly hands it over

NORMAL
Okay when you get to the truck try and
lead him underneath this tree

LEVY
What are you--

NORMAL
There’s no time to explain just trust
me okay

And with that Normal grabs a low-hanging branch and starts to
pull himself up the tree

BECCA
I like that guy So on three then Oh
fuck let’s just go

She grabs Rawlins by the arm and they run into the open towards
Sir Guy’s beleaguered men

Robot One takes the bait giving the rest a chance to head for
the truck under cover of the trees

Petrovsky and Levy look back over their shoulders
PETROVSKY
(re Becca and Rawlins)
Shit They’re fucked
Robot One lumbers towards Becca and Rawlins closing in
It reaches out a long arm to snatch Rawlins but just in time
Becca grabs him lifts him bodily into the air and suddenly
increases her running speed threefold zooming them both away to

the cover of nearby trees in a superhuman blur

PETROVSKY
Whoa

LEVY
Seriously
IE TRUCK - WOODLAND - CONTINUOUS
They reach the truck and all pile in Levy taking the wheel

The truck’s pretty beat up by this point and makes a loud
grating noise as Levy tries to get the ignition started

LEVY
Come on come on

The engine refuses to catch coughing and grating

A hundred yards away Robot One -- now with nothing to chase --
turns to face the sound of the engine

COL STEINHAUSER
Stay calm It’ll start

LEVY
I hope you’re right

Through the windshield they see Robot One start to lumber
towards them

LEVY
Shit shit shit

Robot One is closing the gap Fifty yards Forty

LEVY
Come on you son of a bitch

Thirty Twenty Ten
VROOOOOM

The engine finally roars to life Levy slams it in gear and
wheel-spins the truck away from the advancing robot

Robot One continues to close in as the truck swerves around
trees bumping over their roots

Its blades slash into the back of the truck disembowelling an
unfortunate GERMAN SOLDIER

SGT KRIEGER
(bangs on the truck cab)
Faster faster

As soon as there’s a break in the treeline Levy jerks around the
wheel pulling the truck into a wide u-turn

COL STEINHAUSER
What are you doing We’re going back the
way we came

LEVY
We have to get back to Normal

EXT HIGH TREE BRANCH - WOODLAND - CONTINUOUS

Normal straddles a high branch watching Robot One chase the
truck towards him

He takes the rocket launcher and extends it to its full length --
SHH-CHUNK

He lines the sight up with the relentlessly advancing robot

NORMAL
Come to daddy

The truck tears past underneath him As Robot One follows it
Normal swivels aims and fires a rocket into its back

BOOM The explosion knocks Robot One to the ground where it
twitches and convulses unable to stand up again

A few yards away the truck skids to a stop

EXT UNDERNEATH TREE - WOODLAND - MOMENTS LATER

Levy and others jump out of the truck stand at a cautious
distance from the twitching robot guns aimed

Steinhauser remains in the truck cab He notices that Levy
dropped something on the seat -- the Knowledge He picks it up
and looks at it curiously

Outside Normal drops down from the tree and casually strolls
over to it pulling out his combat knife

NORMAL
Thought that might do it Nice driving
Cap

LEVY

What did How did

NORMAL
Hang on a sec

The others watch open-mouthed as Normal climbs onto the body
of the twitching robot searches around for something on its
back and then stabs hard with his knife a few times beneath the
robot’s shoulder

The robot gives one final shudder and then is still

NORMAL
When I was playing with the other one I
found this little black panel behind the
shoulder with lots of important-looking
circuits in it Figured it was worth a

Pop

PETROVSKY
(baffled but sincere)
Good job Normal

NORMAL
(smiles proudly)
Thanks Sarge

But this cuddly moment is interrupted by sounds of carnage and
death coming through the trees

LEVY
Becca

EXT ANOTHER CLEARING - WOODLAND - CONTINUOUS

Body parts litter the ground as knights and footsoldiers
continue to be hacked to pieces

Becca runs and hops around with astonishing speed and dexterity
pulling soldiers out of harm’s way while dodging the whirling
blades

She sees Rawlins about to be turned into shish-kebab and dives
to push him out of danger catching a hard robot backhand in the
face

She’s knocked to the ground ten feet away stunned Robot Two
turns to pursue but human hands grab Becca by the shoulders and
pull her to her feet

She looks up to find herself face to face with Levy

BECCA
(with a dazed smile)
Hello stranger

Also there are the remaining Americans along with Weiss
(Adeodatus and the Viking also stand behind) They all
simultaneously raise their guns at the advancing robot

Robot Two stops in its tracks The metal blades retract and the
three-barreled guns pop out of its arms

LEVY
(to the men)
Freeze

Nobody moves It’s a Mexican standoff Robot Two keeps its guns
pointed at them but doesn’t fire

LEVY
Put your guns down
(everyone’s hesitant)
Do it

They reluctantly drop their guns Robot Two responds by
retracting the gun barrels Cogs are turning in Levy’s head

LEVY
Okay everybody stay still

PETROVSKY
Jack what are you

Levy bends down slowly and picks up a sword from a hacked off
arm lying on the ground As he comes up with the sword a blade
extends out of Robot Two’s arm

Levy drops the sword The blade in the robot’s arm retracts

LEVY

Now we’re getting somewhere Becca
take Leo Normal Valerio and the Viking
and go right The rest of us are going
left

(Robot Two stalks towards them)
Jenner hang back You know what you’re
aiming for

JENNER
Black panel right shoulder

LEVY
Good Okay move

The group splits in two each half going a different side of the
robot The robot pauses not knowing who to follow

The Viking is the first to engage raising his massive
broadsword with a growling war-cry

Becca and the others pick up swords and spears from the ground
to defend themselves as the robot charges after them

The Viking is a stronger swordsman than the medieval soldiers
He parries the robot’s blows steel sparking against steel It
helps that he also has Becca’s speed and strength at his side

The robot’s other blade extends as Levy’s group charges in from
the other side swords raised forcing the robot to fight two
separate groups with each arm

Unfortunately Robot Two seems more than capable of doing this
and our heroes frequently find themselves running for cover as
their weapons are knocked from their hands

NORMAL
We’ve got to turn it around

INSERT crouched against a tree Jenner raises the sniper scope
to his eye

The two groups try to manoeuvre the robot into exposing its back
to Jenner

In the chaos of whirling steel the robot’s blade manages to
find a gap In one brutal slice Rawlins’s head shoulder and
left arm are separated from his body

VALERIO
Rawlins

Robot Two definitely has the upper hand now and is beating back
our plucky heroes

Levy finds himself scrambling backwards and trips on a tree
root He sprawls on the ground dropping his sword

Robot Two steps in for the kill his blade thundering towards at
defenseless Levy until

BANG

The robot convulses The blade stops in mid-air inches from
Levy’s throat

As the blade jerks erratically we RACK FOCUS to see Jenner
behind it thirty yards away eye to the scope

He fires again The robot stops jerking

Levy breathes a deep sigh of relief

EXT THE SAME - MOMENTS LATER

Levy Petrovsky Valerio and Jenner stand over Rawlins’s body
VALERIO
Motherfuckers

PETROVSKY
We’ve gotta do something Jack We gotta
get out of here

Levy looks around at his men wishing he had something
to say

Sir Guy approaches

SIR GUY
Your comrade fought bravely As did you
all My men and I owe you our lives and
our allegiance
(kneels and bows)
I pledge myself and my army to your
command Captain Jacklevy

LEVY
No look please you don’t need to--

SIR GUY
You have our loyal and devoted service

LEVY
Please get up
(helps Sir Guy to his feet)
I Thank you Go and see to your men

inspiring

Sir Guy does his shoulder-grasp friendship thing and goes

LEVY
Fuck

He walks off towards Normal and Becca who are examining the

still-frozen robot Petrovsky catches up to him

PETROVSKY
Whaddaya mean fuck We just got a whole
bunch of guys on our side

LEVY
You got a whole bunch of guys on your
side I got a whole bunch more lives I’m
now responsible for

PETROVSKY
Jack--

LEVY
Normal any good news

NORMAL
Yeah I just saved a bunch of money on my
car insurance by switching to Geico

LEVY
(not laughing)
Can you figure out an easier way to kill
these things

NORMAL
It would help if they came with a manual
(notices the tense weary
look on Levy’s face)
Ill see what I can do

EXT TRUCK (STATIONARY) - WOODLAND - CONTINUOUS

The truck sits alone where they left it after the chase As we
move round it we find Steinhauser and Krieger huddled together
in the cab

Steinhauser is holding a flat plastic screen -- the Knowledge --
and reading an article titled “World War Two” We can see he’s
devastated as he scrolls past a photograph of Hitler

COL STEINHAUSER
He kills himself After everything he
I believed in him Krieger I believed we
were making a better world

SGT KRIEGER
I know sir Im sorry

COL STEINHAUSER
Its my fault

SGT KRIEGER
What

COL STEINHAUSER
Our mission I failed I was supposed to
bring the Fuhrer victory and I failed

SGT KRIEGER
Sir what are you talking about No one
could have foreseen this Theres
nothing you could do

Steinhauser doesn’t seem to hear him staring at the screen

COL STEINHAUSER
But maybe its not too late

He scrolls down to a picture of a MUSHROOM CLOUD

EXT CLEARING - WOODLAND - MOMENTS LATER

Steinhauser and Krieger approach Levy Becca and Weiss who are
helping medieval knights patch up their wounds

COL STEINHAUSER
I hear the knights have agreed to join
us That’s good news we’ll need more
men My unit is almost finished

LEVY
Right but more men for what

Steinhauser’s eyes flick briefly to the ‘football’-nuke strapped
to Becca’s back

COL STEINHAUSER
If I may
(he crouches next to Levy
lowers his voice)
To fight back If we can convince more
armies to join us we could get a real
force together

LEVY
Okay well assuming we can persuade
another army to join us--

COL STEINHAUSER
You inspired these men you can inspire

others

BECCA
He’s right As soon as anyone sees we’ve
taken out a robot -- two robots -- they’1l

join Anyone who’s been here a while knows
what that means

LEVY
Fine but even then what do we do just
wait for them to send fifty of those
things or a hundred

BECCA
We go to the hole I made If we get big
enough numbers we can storm it fight
our way out

As Levy ponders this Normal comes sauntering over

NORMAL
Any chance we could get the truck over
here

INT TRUCK (MOVING) - WOODLAND - MOMENTS LATER
Levy and Becca drive the truck back over to Normal

LEVY
I’m not disagreeing but we need to
think this through

BECCA
What’s to think Uncle Fritz finally
came up with a good idea We get out
find whoever brought us here and get
them to send us back

LEVY
How

BECCA

pats the football-nuke)
We tell them that if they don’t we’1l
nuke ‘em

LEVY
Okay but we’d also be nuking ourselves
You want us to be suicide bombers

BECCA
I’m sorry did you have other plans for
the evening

EXT CLEARING - WOODLAND - MOMENTS LATER

The truck’s parked next to Robot Two which Normal has laid out
on the ground next to a dismantled radio

LEVY
You really think you can do it

NORMAL
Don’t see why not Just needs a couple
of bits of engine and then the radio
which let’s face it wasn’t doing us
much good anyway

PETROVSKY
How’re we supposed to move the truck if
youve taken apart the engine

Normal turns to one of the knights on horseback

CUT TO

EXT TRUCK (STATIONARY) - WOODLAND - LATER

Sir Guy sits on the roof of the cab holding a set of reins
Hitched up to the cab in front of him are four HORSES to pull
the truck along like a wagon

SIR GUY
Ready

LEVY
(to everyone)
Alright let’s move out
Sir Guy flicks the reins and the horses pull the truck forward
Normal sits in the back dismantling and tinkering with his
radio the truck’s engine and the dead robot like a science
project

The two other mangled robots are dragged on the ground behind

The rest follow on foot or horseback Becca looks on proudly and
pats Levy on the back

BECCA
Alright Jackie-boy let’s go looking
for a fight

As the procession moves off

MATCH CUT TO

INT CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Once again we’re watching the action on a 3-D holographic screen
in some dark mysterious room

The familiar strange voices speak once more as slender fingers
manipulate controls allowing them to view the images from
different angles

VOICE 2 (0C)
Theyve done it again Interesting

VOICE 1 (0C)
Shall I send the robots

VOICE 2 (0C)
No leave them Lets see what happens

EXT VARIOUS LANDSCAPES - LATER
SERIES OF SHOTS showing the procession marching through Arena

- As they march the trees and mist suddenly stop in a dead
straight line so they find themselves traveling again through
the unnaturally empty featureless landscape

- The Viking nudges Valerio and points three VIKING LONGOBOATS
sit beached and empty in the middle of the empty landscape
It’s an eerie sight

- Levy talks to Becca as they share water from his canteen She
checks their heading on a futuristic compass that’s grafted onto
her wrist like a moving tattoo

- Normal concentrates intently on attaching pieces of engine and
radio to the back of the robot

-Steinhauser eyes the football-nuke strapped to Becca’s back
and the plasma grenades on her webbing

- In the Control Room hands move over the console selecting
options from a virtual TERRAIN MAP

- In the Arena the landscape changes The ground turns rocky
sinking downwards on one side while shooting up on the other
Soon they’re in a narrow Alpine pathway surrounded by snow-
capped mountains

EXT ALPINE LANDSCAPE - LATER

The horses are starting to have trouble pulling the truck-wagon
over the rocky terrain Becca Levy Weiss and the Viking have
to help push it over small boulders

LEVY
What kind of army fights in a landscape
like this

An animalistic trumpeting sound echoes over to them across the
mountains Everybody stops dead listening

SIR GUY
(to horses)
Whoa there

Another trumpeting sound this time closer There’s also a deep
rumbling almost like an earthquake

BECCA
(answering Levy)
I think we’re about to find out

The rumbling grows louder Small rocks and pebbles are shaken
loose trickling down the mountain

Everybody stares at the path ahead

The rumbling is now accompanied by the indiscernible rabble of
human voices approaching

COL STEINHAUSER
Captain Might it not be

He makes a ‘gun’ gesture Levy nods

LEVY
Prudent Right
(calls out)
Weapons ready Nobody attacks until I
give the word

He pushes his way past the truck-wagon to the front of the
group accompanied by Becca

The rumbling and voices are really loud now

BECCA
Here they come

As the oncoming army rounds the corner Levy and co find
themselves face to face with dozens of dark-skinned soldiers
armed with exotic-looking swords and shields

Most notable however is the fact that they are accompanied by
five massive African ELEPHANTS -- twenty tons of grey flesh
fronted by gleaming ivory tusks

SIR GUY
(under his breath)
Sweet heavenly father

PETROVSKY
(under his breath)
Fuck me

Levy and Becca walk out towards them hands in the air as a
gesture of surrender

LEVY
Any idea who were dealing with here

BECCA
Judging by the elephants I’m gonna say
Carthaginians third century BC These
guys are good

LEVY
You think you can translate

BECCA
I’1ll give it a shot

Up ahead the Carthaginian army slows to a stop regarding our
motley bunch with curiosity Levy clears his throat

LEVY
Friends We mean you no harm

He looks at Becca to translate

BECCA
Is that it

LEVY
Let’s just start there shall we

BECCA
Fair enough

Becca says something in a strange and unfamiliar language her
voice coming out with a metallic artificial twang

There is no movement from the Carthaginians

LEVY
You think they understood

BECCA
Say something else

LEVY
We are not your enemies Join us to
fight those who have taken us all from
our homes

Becca translates simultaneously Again no reaction
LEVY

I thought you said this was gonna be
easy

BECCA
Well maybe I
One of the Carthaginians -- wearing decorated armor and a
splendid headdress -- starts to approach them
Levy looks at Becca nervously as he approaches But the

CARTHAGINIAN CHIEF walks straight past them as if they weren’t
there

LEVY
What the

They turn and watch him walk over to the back of the truck He
stands for a moment staring at the mangled robots

He tentatively kicks one of them Then again harder

He starts walking back towards Becca and Levy suddenly shouting
something to his companions

LEVY
What did he

The Carthaginian Chief comes right up to Levy standing almost
nose-to-nose with him He stares intensely for a moment Then
falls to the ground and bows deeply

LEVY
Um okaaay

Immediately the rest of the Carthaginian army falls to the
ground in a deep low bow Becca grins

BECCA
See I always wanted to ride an elephant

BEGIN MONTAGE

EXT VARIOUS LANDSCAPES - LATER

Becca sits atop an elephant leading our ragtag army through
different landscapes as it gradually swells in size

- On a rolling grassy plain Levy gives his speech to a 16th
Century CHINESE COMMANDER while Becca translates We see that
the 50-strong Chinese unit is armed with large CANNONS
elaborately decorated as dragons

- In a rainy tree-studded meadow Levy shakes hands with a
FRENCH NAPOLEONIC SOLDIER as his 35 blue-coated men -- armed
with muskets -- mingle with the group

- Steinhauser and Krieger brush past Becca as they march
Steinhauser smiles and apologizes but we see that Krieger has
swiped a PLASMA GRENADE from her webbing

- In an arid red desert a group of 20 AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES
poke prod and sniff the mangled robots tied to the truck one
of them tapping it with a sharpened wooden boomerang

- We see Levy’s army grow larger and larger on the 3-D
holographic screen in the Control Room

END MONTAGE

EXT RED DESERT LANDSCAPE - DAY

Levy and Becca walk through their now nearly 500-strong army
diverse soldiers mingling horses tied up next to elephants
Viking Chinese and Napoleonic warriors comparing battle scars

BECCA
Congratulations Jack You’ve built your
very own United Nations Now we just
need a bunch of governments to ignore
everything it says

They walk past Jenner comparing rifles with a gobsmacked
Napoleonic musketeer

Nearby the Aborigines give a display of boomerang throwing and
catching to an astonished group of Carthaginians

LEVY
We could use some better hardware

BECCA
Fuck the hardware We’ve got something
much more important

LEVY
What’s that

She walks right up to him so their noses are almost touching
looks deep into his eyes Then grabs his crotch

BECCA
Balls

They both smile The tension between them is electric But
it’s broken by a polite cough

They turn to see Weiss and Petrovsky watching them amused

CPT WEISS
Sorry to disturb you

LEVY
What’s up

PETROVSKY
Just did an ammo count We’re running a
little low

Levy looks over at a nearby boulder where the two mangled robots
have been strung up for target practice

Valerio oversees as a group of knights aborigines and
Carthaginians all throw spears most hitting the black
rectangular weak spot on the robots’ backs dead on

LEVY
Never mind I don’t think it’s gonna be
guns that win this anyhow

EXT NEAR THE TRUCK - RED DESERT LANDSCAPE - CONTINUOUS

Krieger hovers by the sliced crate containing the German nuke
The two remaining GERMAN SOLDIERS stand guard

Crouched next to the open side of the crate is Steinhauser He’s
rigging up the PLASMA GRENADE they stole to the nuke

SGT KRIEGER
Youre certain well be able to escape
the blast sir

COL STEINHAUSER

It wont be a nuclear detonation The design
is like two bombs The outer one

(points to the sphere of partially-

sliced plastic explosive)
-explodes triggering the nuclear
reaction inside But our trigger is broken
Still the bang should be sufficient for
our purposes

SGT KRIEGER
How many will it take out

COL STEINHAUSER
Enough The Vikings the Sioux and the
Americans make three The assault will
weaken them so we can take the rest When
only need seven to get sent back The
woman will be our only problem

SGT KRIEGER
(hesitant)
Are you sure this is the best course
of action sir They might succeed If
we were to help them

COL STEINHAUSER
No Its a fools errand This is the
only way

SGT KRIEGER
Should we not at least discuss it with
Captain Weiss

COL STEINHAUSER
I have reason to question Captain Weisss
loyalties Should I also question yours

SGT KRIEGER
No sir but--

COL STEINHAUSER
Do you understand the opportunity weve
got here Sergeant We have been given a
second chance at history at winning the
war We have been chosen

INT CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Two FIGURES -- vague outlines of spindly humanoid bodies --
stand in shadow watching the 3-D hologram

VOICE 1
One of them is playing the game

VOICE 2
Good Betrayal is a predictable side-
effect of the survival instinct Lets
help him

VOICE 1
How

‘Voice 2’ moves to the console hits buttons The 3-D image
switches from Steinhauser and Krieger to show rows upon rows
upon rows of ROBOTS neatly in formation waiting

Voice 2 hits more buttons Three robots break out of formation
and move off

EXT TRUCK - RED DESERT LANDSCAPE - LATER

Levy Becca and Petrovsky watch Normal put the finishing touches
on whatever he’s doing to his robot

NORMAL
Anyone else find it odd how it never
gets dark here

PETROVSKY
Fuckin’ A I have no idea how long it’s
been since I last slept

BECCA
(to Normal)
You notice the little things don’t you

NORMAL
I guess Drives these guys crazy

BECCA
(re robot mechanics)
How do you know how to do all that

NORMAL
Ah y’know used to play around in my
dad’s garage at home Plus I was a double
major in physics and engineering at
Stanford so that helps

He presses something and machine guns extend out of the robot’s
arms He presses it again and they retract

BECCA
There’s no conscription where you guys
are from right You all volunteered
(they all nod)
Then forgive me for asking Normal but
what the fuck’s a brainiac like you doing
in the army

NORMAL
(laughs still tinkering)
Well I guess three reasons One to
piss off the Sarge here

PETROVSKY
He’s good at that

NORMAL
Two for the life experience

BECCA
Okay bullshit bullshit Three

NORMAL
(grins)
Armys got the best toys

He takes the Drone Plane’s REMOTE CONTROL from his pack and
starts pushing buttons The robot sits up turns its head to
face the other three and waves

PETROVSKY
Ho-ly shit

NORMAL
He likes you

Levy’s been quietly thinking this whole time

LEVY
Normal that physics degree teach you
anything about time travel

NORMAL
Not much but I have seen Back to the
Future a bunch of times What’s on your
mind Cap

LEVY
Malouf

NORMAL
The guy with the hostages

LEVY
According to Becca’s history book Knowledge
thing he pretty much fucks up the world and
starts a nuclear war right So what would
happen if we went back and took him out

BECCA
What are you talking about Jack

LEVY
Just for the sake of argument
NORMAL
Well I dunno I guess either it works

out and you change the future and
everything’s sunshine and rainbows and
baskets of kittens Or you create a
paradox that unravels the fabric of space-
time and destroys the universe

PETROVSKY
I like the kittens one better

COL STEINHAUSER
How are the preparations coming

They turn to see Steinhauser and Krieger approaching

LEVY
Fine Where have you been

COL STEINHAUSER
We were wondering how far we are from
this hole of yours I was thinking we
should scout the area before we attack
see what we’re up against

BECCA
That’s not a bad idea We’re close
Should be just north of here
Levy grabs up his rifle
LEVY
Normal tell the others to get ready

EXT ROCKY SLOPE - RED DESERT LANDSCAPE - LATER

Becca leads Levy and Petrovsky cautiously up a hill weaving
behind large boulders for cover Steinhauser and Krieger bring
up the rear They reach the crest of the ridge

BECCA
(whispers )
There About fifty meters

We follow her gaze down the hill to see the charred hole in an
otherwise seamless fake horizon It’s guarded by a large group
of ROBOTS

LEVY
That’s a lot of protection

PETROVSKY
I count twenty

As they scan the area Steinhauser and Krieger quietly drop back
and pull out their pistols Steinhauser aims at Becca’s head and
pulls back the hammer with a soft ‘click’

Becca spins round Before they know what’s happened the Germans
are on the ground with bloodied faces Becca aiming their guns
at them

LEVY
Jesus

BECCA
What the fuck do you think you’re doing

PETROVSKY
You back-stabbing Nazi piece of shit

Steinhauser nurses his bleeding lip then looks up The color
drains from his face

Petrovsky follows his gaze to see THREE ROBOTS standing right
behind them

PETROVSKY
Fuck

He tries to go for his gun but doesn’t stand a chance The
first robots slams a metal fist into his forehead

The second clips Levy round the back of the neck knocking him
out while the third grabs Becca by the throat and lifts her
into the air

She fires at it with the Germans’ pistols but the bullets
bounce harmlessly off It swats the pistols to the ground

Then as quickly as they arrived the robots run off
disappearing through the HOLE and taking Becca Levy and
Petrovsky with them

The two baffled and terrified Germans are left just sitting
there alone

EXT MAIN CAMP - RED DESERT LANDSCAPE - LATER

Everybody hustles and bustles gearing up for the attack

Jenner (now sporting a metal breastplate over his fatigues)
Weiss Valerio Adeodatus and the Viking are gathered around the

truck as Normal prepares to unveil his masterpiece

JENNER
Whenever you’re ready Normal

VALERIO
That means hurry the fuck up

NORMAL
Valerio my friend you’re gonna have to
learn to start being nice to me

VALERIO
Oh yeah why’s that

Normal picks up the remote control

NORMAL
Because me and Ralph here aren’t gonna
take any more of your shit

VALERIO
Ralph

Normal fiddles with the remote control The robot steps down
from the truck onto the ground moves to face Valerio then
extends both blades out of its arms

ADEODATUS
(in awe trying some English)
Yo mama’s got a peg leg with a kickstand

NORMAL
You can say that again

Steinhauser and Krieger walk over to the truck looking dazed

NORMAL
Hey where’s the Cap

Steinhauser calls over the two German Soldiers and they start
loading the sliced crate into the truck

COL STEINHAUSER
He was captured along with the others We
managed to escape

CPT WEISS
What

JENNER
Captured by who

COL STEINHAUSER
The robots They were taken through the
exit We must attack now and rescue them

NORMAL
How come you guys got away

COL STEINHAUSER
They let us go

NORMAL
(suspicious)
Why would they let you go

Steinhauser looks right at him and speaks with deep sincerity

COL STEINHAUSER
I don’t know But we have lost a leader and
a friend and we have to get him back We
have to get all of them back

With the crate loaded he climbs onto the roof of the truck cab
and takes the reins of the horses Krieger starts to get into
the back but Weiss stops him

CPT WEISS
Krieger what happened

Krieger isn’t as good an actor as Steinhauser he can’t look
Weiss in the eye

SGT KRIEGER
It’s just as the Colonel said sir

He pulls himself up into the back with the other two German
Soldiers and the nuke Steinhauser flicks the reins and the
truck-wagon rolls off towards the front of the army

VALERIO
What do we do

NORMAL
We go get the Cap back

Remote control in hand he moves off after the enormous departing
army Ralph the robot following him like a dog

INT FEATURELESS ROOMVARIOUS LANDSCAPES - THE SAME TIME
Levy awakes to find himself in a bare circular room The first
thing he sees is Petrovsky slumped against the wall blood

pouring from the re-opened wound on his forehead

LEVY
Leo

Petrovsky just grunts Levy sits up and notices Becca walking
along the walls examining them

LEVY
What are you doing
BECCA
We’re in a room with no doors Neat

trick

Suddenly a tall strange-looking MAN appears apparently out of
thin air He’s recognizably human but not like you or I

He’s thin and frail-looking with artificial eyes ears and
other body parts -- if Becca is an early example of human-bionic
hybrid technology this guy is an advanced case

Well call him THE CONTROLLER

THE CONTROLLER
Hello

His voice has a hollow metallic quality to it like when Becca
speaks in a foreign language

LEVY
Who are you

THE CONTROLLER
I control what you call Arena

BECCA
You’re the one who brought us here

THE CONTROLLER
Yes

LEVY
Where are we

THE CONTROLLER
In a self-contained environmental
capsule underneath the Pacific Ocean

LEVY
So we’re on Earth

BECCA
When What year

THE CONTROLLER
Our calendar would be meaningless to
you We are more than one thousand years
from your time

(MORE )

THE CONTROLLER (contd)
For centuries we have brought armies
from history here to fight so that we
may share their experience

BECCA
Who’s we

THE CONTROLLER
Everyone Earth’s entire population is
connected to Arena

The walls disappear They’re in some kind of stadium Where the
seats would be are thousands -- maybe millions -- of screens
stretching up as far as the eye can see

On each screen is a ‘human’ face like the Controller’s Each
head has some kind of wire going into it

Suddenly familiar landscapes materialize around them and
they’re standing in the middle of a series of 3-D instant
replays

First there’s the Sioux chasing the truck through tall grass

This melts away to be replaced by them fighting the robots in
the forest

This melts away to show their super-army now live led by
Steinhauser marching through red desert towards the robots
guarding the hole in the wall

LEVY
What is this We’re a fucking TV show

THE CONTROLLER

TV show

(he cocks his head and is

silent for a moment)
Ah No You are not entertainment you are
part of a worldwide experiment A very
successful one We don’t watch it We feel
it

LEVY
What does that mean

THE CONTROLLER
Everyone here has come from a time when
society was filled with war and violence
We have taken those things out of our
society and put them in Arena The outside
world is now at peace But we have found
that to maintain this peace we must satisfy
the violent urges of the human soul

(MORE )

THE CONTROLLER (contd)
We feel what goes on inside Arena We bring
you here to fight so that the rest of us
can live in peace

BECCA
So what your lives are more important
than ours

THE CONTROLLER
Your lives were about to end

The landscape around them changes as The Controller speaks

THE CONTROLLER
You and your squad were taken before a
nuclear detonation was to destroy your
vehicle

Suddenly they’re in a futuristic urban landscape standing next
to Becca’s APC which vanishes in a flash of white just before a
huge fireball engulfs the whole landscape

Becca and Levy cower as the flames rush over them but soon
realize they’re just standing in a sophisticated hologram

THE CONTROLLER
(turns to Levy)
Your unit was under heavy fire which you
would not have survived

Now they’re on the Iraqi roadside from the start Levy watches
the holographic version of his unit cowering between the Humvees
as bullets rockets and mortars rain in on them

They disappear in a flash of white just before a mortar explodes
right where they stood

THE CONTROLLER
The same is true for all fighters chosen
for Arena

Different landscapes materialize on all sides As they turn to
try and take it all in we catch glimpses of

- World War Two armed British troops approach the GERMAN TRUCK
at the road block from the start

- Three VIKING LONGBOATS sail on incredibly stormy seas
Lightning flashes as a huge wave capsizes two of the boats

- The CARTHAGINIAN elephant unit marching through the Alps is
suddenly engulfed by a massive avalanche

THE CONTROLLER
We have not taken away life from you We
have given you longer life Life with
purpose A noble purpose

LEVY
You’re cold-blooded killers and you’ve
talked yourselves out of taking moral
responsibility for it

THE CONTROLLER
You question our morals and yet you were
invading another country and killing its
people You the Nazis the Romans the
Vikings the Crusaders You are all the
same Fighting for religion power wealth
We don’t choose you at random Forgive me
if I do not feel guilt for turning invaders
into peacekeepers

BECCA
Peace You call this peace

THE CONTROLLER
Youre fighting in here so that we don’t
have to fight out there

The landscape transforms into a futuristic utopia -- gleaming
architecture peaceful serenity beautiful clean environment

LEVY
(to himself)
Where have I heard that before

THE CONTROLLER
Surely you can see that our cause is
good

BECCA
Having a good cause doesn’t justify
killing innocent people

BATES (0C)
Innocent

Becca turns at the sound of this new voice The Controller
suddenly vanishes The hologram around them fades An empty
floor extends a couple of hundred yards in each direction

In the middle of it stand three figures dressed in black combat
suits like Beccas

BECCA
Oh shit I think we’re in trouble

EXT THE EXIT - RED DESERT LANDSCAPE - DAY

The patchwork army forms a long line facing the exit -- elephants
cannons Napoleonic riflemen knights aborigines

In the middle of it all sits Steinhauser on the truck Krieger
and the other Germans in the back with the crate the Americans
and Normal’s robot nearby

The robot army stands facing them evenly spaced waiting

NORMAL
Could be worse

VALERIO
(to Steinhauser)
So what’s the plan

COL STEINHAUSER
Our numbers are our strength United we
can win We stay in compact formation
don’t let them separate us

NORMAL
Roger that
(turns to Jenner)
Not such a bad guy for a Nazi

Steinhauser raises his arm and calls out to the whole army

COL STEINHAUSER
Ready
(looks up and down the line
then throws down his arm)
CHAAAAAARGE

A great battle cry rises from the group as everyone thunders
towards the robots

But Steinhauser and the truck don’t move

SGT KRIEGER
Colonel shouldnt we--

COL STEINHAUSER
Let the robots thin them out No need to
take unnecessary risks

EXT BATTLEFIELD - THE EXIT - RED DESERT LANDSCAPE - CONTINUOUS

Alright folks it’s time for our epic sweeping Lord-of-the-
Rings-meets-300 battle

The ELEPHANTS are the first to engage the enemy The robots are
big but they’re bigger

One robot is trampled by two stampeding elephants Another is
flung into the air by an elephant’s tusks

It clatters to the ground like a rag doll but immediately gets
up and slams into the side its attacker sending the elephant
sprawling legs kicking the air

As soon as the Carthaginian footsoldiers make it over with their
swords and spears the robots get out their blades and things
start to get bloody

MEANWHILE

Down the line the Napoleonic RIFLEMEN pull up twenty yards from
a couple of robots and shoulder their rifles They aim as a
COMMANDER calls out

FRENCH COMMANDER
Visez

Jenner sees what’s about to happen runs over

JENNER
No Wait Don’t shoot

But he’s too late

FRENCH COMMANDER
Tirez

The riflemen let fly at the robots but the bullets just bounce
off harmlessly

The robots produce machine guns from their arms and mow down
half the French unit as Jenner looks helplessly on

MEANWHILE

Weiss Valerio Adeodatus and the Viking are rolling with Sir
Guy and a mixed group of KNIGHTS and ABORIGINES

Some medieval footsoldiers let loose a cloud of arrows at the
robots which have little effect

CPT WEISS
We need to turn them around

VALERIO
Right
(to a knight)
Hey can you

He trails off as the aborigines step forward They all hurl
their sharpened BOOMERANGS towards the robots

The boomerangs fly over the robots’ heads then swing round and
come back at them from behind

Most of the boomerangs clatter off the robots’ backs harmlessly
but one manages to find its mark lodging in the vulnerable
circuitry panel

The robot starts to twitch spinning around in a circle

VALERIO
(impressed)
Son of a bitch

CPT WEISS
(to the archers)
Now now The black panel

This time with the robot spinning around the arrows can hit
something useful Three or four thunk into the black panel
taking the robot down

Unfortunately this seems to piss off the dead robot’s three
friends who charge at the footsoldiers blades out

Soldiers flee as their comrades are cut to pieces but find
themselves running straight towards a wall of CHINESE CANNONS

The Chinese yell to get out of the way as they light the fuses

Rasta Viking just stares confusedly at these strange metal
tubes not comprehending

Weiss dives pulling him to the ground just as the cannon
nearest them goes off sending a huge bowling ball of metal
whistling past their heads

The line of cannon fire SLAMS into the three robots knocking
them down like skittles

VALERIO
Now that’s more fucking like it

The soldiers swarm over to the downed robots stabbing at their
backs with swords and spears

Rasta Viking drives his sword through one robot’s circuit panel
like a hot knife through butter He grins as it judders and
dies yelling to Valerio

RASTA VIKING
Fuck you you fucking fuck

Valerio grins back but his smile disappears as he sees another
robot charging up behind the Viking

VALERIO
Look out

The Viking turns in time to see the robot’s blade swing toward
his head but at the last second

CRASH

Normal’s remote-control robot ‘RALPH’ streaks in out of nowhere
taking the Viking’s attacker down

VALERIO
Way to go Normal

Normal stands off to the side brow furrowed in concentration as
he puts Ralph through primitive robot street-fighting moves

It’s a scrappy fight but Normal manages to put Ralph’s blades
through the other robot’s circuit panel taking it out

In a LONG CRANE SHOT surveying the battle we see that while the
field is awash with blood and hacked-off limbs our weird little
army of misfits are managing to hold their own

INT STADIUMIRAQI URBAN LANDSCAPE - THE SAME TIME

The black silhouettes of Becca’s unit stride towards her Levy
and Petrovsky as an Iraqi urban landscape materializes

LEVY
These are your friends

BECCA
‘Friends’ is a strong word Be careful

The ‘friends’ stop a little short of them -- BATES and WARREN
(male 30’s) -- and VICKERS (female 20s) They’re carrying
some kind of rifles

BATES
Corporal Harris

BECCA
Lieutenant Bates I’m glad to see you’re
all alive

A fresh red scar runs down Warren’s face

WARREN
No thanks to you

The tension between them is palpable

BECCA
So what now
VICKERS
Now we kill you
BECCA
And what they promised to send you
back
WARREN
(laughs)
Why the fuck would we want to go back
BATES
The deal is if we kill you we get to
stay
BECCA

You want to stay

WARREN
Id rather kill for something than die
for nothing

BECCA
Well that’s very big of you Warren

BATES
Enough chat

He steps towards Becca
Levy readies his rifle The landscape around them is now
complete They stand at a crossroads surrounded by rubble and

dilapidated buildings

Becca takes the nuke off her back drops it on the ground and
loosens her shoulders like a boxer preparing for a fight

BECCA
(to Levy)
Get out of here

Suddenly Bates puts on a burst of speed and he and Becca are
engaged in blistering bionically-enhanced hand-to-hand combat

Becca’s holding her own until Vickers joins in the fight Warren
just looks on casually holding his rifle

Levy makes eye contact with Petrovsky as their hands slide
towards their triggers

In a moment Becca is down kicked against a wall

LEVY
Now

Levy blasts away at Warren bullets putting him on the ground
Petrovsky fires thirty rounds into Vickers but only succeeds in
knocking her back a few paces

Bates goes for his gun firing a huge blast of something red and
hot which just misses Levy and DESTROYS the wall of the
building behind him showering him with debris

Levy fires a round from his barrel-mounted grenade launcher
straight into Bates’s chest It explodes blowing Bates
backwards off his feet and clean through a wall

Vickers marches menacingly towards Petrovsky but before she
reaches him Becca hops up and attacks her from behind sweeping
Vickers’s legs out from under her and spectacularly PUNTING her
across the intersection

PETROVSKY
That wasn’t so hard

BECCA
They haven’t started yet

Warren gets to his feet and starts fiddling with his rifle

BECCA
Come on

She grabs Levy and Petrovsky and they run as Warren opens fire
behind them tracer bullets whizzing past their heads

They duck round a corner Levy and Petrovsky lean back against
the wall panting to get their breath back

BECCA
Keep moving

LEVY
What

We soon see why Warren continues to fire his heat-seeking
bullets actually curving AROUND THE CORNER and slamming into the
wall by Levy and Petrovsky tearing it apart

PETROVSKY
Goddamn

They double-time it along the wall as bullets continue to curve
round the corner after them Soon they reach another
intersection where a dust-covered Bates is waiting

He throws some kind of electronic grenade which lands at
Petrovsky’s feet Petrovsky moves to kick it away

BECCA
Don’t

Too late As he kicks it the grenade binds itself to
Petrovsky’s foot He tries to shake it off

PETROVSKY
Son of a bitch

--but to no avail Small blue lightning bolts explode out of
the grenade electrocuting Petrovsky

After a moment the lightning stops leaving him twitching and
convulsing on the ground eyes wide open

LEVY
Leo

BECCA
He’s just stunned They’re playing with
us

FROM ABOVE the black-suited warriors converge on our heroes

EXT BATTLEFIELD - THE EXIT - RED DESERT LANDSCAPE - DAY

Back in Arena the battle with the robots is still raging All
the different parts of the army have started to work together

A Carthaginian elephant unit plows a robot into the path of a
Chinese cannon which blows it away

Aborigines surround Normal’s robot Ralph taking every
opportunity it opens up for them to hurl spears and boomerangs
into the robots’ circuit panels

Weiss and Valerio have picked up swords and take on a robot’s
swirling blades alongside Adeodatus the Viking Sir Guy and
another KNIGHT

SIR GUY
Back demon Back

The robot responds by slicing open the other knight’s belly
before suddenly twitching convulsing and collapsing

CPT WEISS
What happened

SIR GUY
(crosses himself)
Divine retribution

But looking across the battlefield the same happens with the
robot Ralph and the Aborigines are fighting -- it suddenly just
freezes and keels over

NORMAL
(calling to Valerio)
Who’s doing that

Two other robots back off for a minute and scan the area One of
them suddenly freezes and collapses The remaining robot tracks
where this mysterious attack came from and sees

JENNER firing from under a pile of dead French soldiers
The robot charges towards him Jenner tries to wriggle out from
the pile of bodies but he’s slow and before he can move the

robot KICKS sending him and other bodies sprawling

VALERIO
Normal nine o’clock

NORMAL
(looks sees Jenner)
I got him
He sends Ralph sprinting over to tackle the attacking robot

Jenner watches them wrestle on the ground He reaches for his
rifle but finds it bent and mangled from the robot’s kick

JENNER
Shit

His eyes fall on the next best thing -- a Napoleonic musket

As he raises it he’s quite a sight -- sporting modern desert
camouflage underneath a steel medieval breastplate and squinting
down the barrel of an antique rifle

He aims and fires The flaming gunpowder singes his face but it

does the job -- the robot is taken out
JENNER
(re musket)
Not bad

EXT TRUCK - RED DESERT LANDSCAPE - CONTINUOUS
The Germans watch the battle from a safe distance

SGT KRIEGER
Theyre winning Theres still time to
reconsider

He’s right -- there are only two robots left (plus Ralph) and
they’re overwhelmed by the manpower and energy of the army

COL STEINHAUSER

(ignoring him)
Theyre still tightly packed We should be
able to take out all of them When we drop
the bomb we have to get out through the
hole We still need the womans nuclear
weapon

(beat)
Sergeant

SGT KRIEGER
(very reluctantly)
Yes sir
The two other soldiers ready their weapons as Steinhauser flicks
the reins and the horses lumber forward

EXT BATTLEFIELD - RED DESERT LANDSCAPE - CONTINUOUS

Jenner pats Normal on the back as he disentangles Ralph from the
robot that tried to kill Jenner

JENNER
Thanks man

NORMAL
No problem
(looks around)
Whaddaya know We beat ‘em

JENNER
So that’s it Mission Accomplished
The Viking -- standing nearby with Sir Guy -- says something and
points

Normal looks round and sees the truck-wagon rolling towards the
main group of warriors about fifty yards away

NORMAL
Look who decided to join the party

EXT NEARBY - BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS

Steinhauser pulls the horses to a stop next to a large group of
exhausted fighters

Weiss approaches as Krieger and the two German Soldiers shove
the crate off the back of the truck onto the ground

CPT WEISS
What are you doing

Krieger can’t look him in the eye He pushes a button on the
plasma grenade and hops back in the truck

A timer on the grenade starts counting down 30 seconds

CPT WEISS
(starts to ready his gun)
Colonel What’s going on

COL STEINHAUSER
I’m saving the Fatherland

He pulls out his pistol and SHOOTS Weiss in the heart

SGT KRIEGER
(horrified)
Colonel

Steinhauser flicks the reins and the horses start galloping away
from Weiss’s body the nuke and the rest of the army which
begins hurling spears and boomerangs at them

The Chinese scramble to get their cannons into position but
they’re cut down by the two German Soldiers firing from the back
of the truck

Soldiers turn and flee in terror cut down mercilessly from
behind by the Germans’ guns

Valerio tries to give covering fire taking out one of the
Germans as Adeodatus is ripped to pieces

VALERIO
No

EXT NEARBY - BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS

Normal Jenner the Viking and Sir Guy watch in horror from a
distance as the Germans flee towards the hole mowing down
anyone in their way

JENNER
What the fuck

SIR GUY
That bloodless traitor

Jenner grabs his mangled sniper rifle off the ground and peers
through the scope

THROUGH SCOPE the second German Soldier catches a spear through
the chest but the truck’s still getting away

NORMAL
What did they drop on the ground

THROUGH SCOPE Jenner PANS DOWN to the crate The open side is
facing them and he can make out the bomb inside along with red
numbers counting down
JENNER
Oh shit
EXT HOLE IN THE WALL - RED DESERT LANDSCAPE - CONTINUOUS

The truck-wagon reaches the hole Steinhauser parks it sideways
so it’s blocking the hole from attack

He and Krieger leap out and run through the hole

EXT BATTLEFIELD - RED DESERT LANDSCAPE - CONTINUOUS
The timer on the grenade in the crate ticks down to zero
KABOOM

A huge fireball rips through the survivors of the army
engulfing soldiers elephants Everything

Valerio is among those who are instantly incinerated

EXT NEARBY - BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS

As the crate explodes Jenner the Viking Sir Guy and Normal hit
the ground

Normal makes Ralph the robot lie over them for cover as the
fireball rips towards them

INT TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

Steinhauser and Krieger -- running down a dark industrial-
looking tunnel -- dive for cover as a jet of flame shoots
through the hole after them streaking over their heads

Then everything is quiet They get back on their feet

SGT KRIEGER
You think it worked

COL STEINHAUSER
I dont know Were still here Perhaps we
need to get the others before they send us
back

They jog along until they come to a fork in the tunnel

SGT KRIEGER
Which way

A heavy steel wall slams one of the tunnels shut leaving them
no choice Steinhauser heads down the open fork

COL STEINHAUSER
Hurry

They race through the maze of tunnels Every time they have a
choice of direction a wall or door seals one of the paths shut
leaving them with only one option

Finally they reach a dead end

SGT KRIEGER
What now

COL STEINHAUSER
We go back find another way

But as they turn to retrace their steps another wall blocks
their path leaving them in a small closed box

Steinhauser paws over the walls trying to find a way out
There’s a deep rumbling sound and the floor shakes

SGT KRIEGER
What was that

With a lurch the floor starts moving upwards like an elevator
Steinhauser and Krieger cower afraid of being crushed against the
ceiling but it disappears at the last moment

The floor stops moving and they find themselves in a dark room
They feel around trying to get their bearings

COL STEINHAUSER
Where are we

Suddenly a body CRASHES into the room through the ceiling
letting in a broad shaft of light The body on the floor groans
and rolls over revealing

COL STEINHAUSER
Levy

Levy squints up at Steinhauser Then his eyes widen

LEVY
You

He leaps off the ground tackling Steinhauser hard against a
door which collapses They tumble out into
INT IRAQI-STYLE STREET - STADIUM - CONTINUOUS

Krieger follows as Levy and Steinhauser get to their feet Levy
is already battered and bruised Hate burns in his eyes

He starts to beat the crap out of Steinhauser raining punches
on his face and stomach

COL STEINHAUSER
(between punches)
Krieger

Eventually Levy knocks Steinhauser to the ground straddling him
and squeezing his neck Steinhauser gasps for air

LEVY
(nose to nose)
You were going to kill us

COL STEINHAUSER
(wheezing)
Krieger Get him off

Krieger is distracted for a moment by the enormous stadium
filled with the on-screen spectators Levy squeezes harder

COL STEINHAUSER
Krieger
(Krieger finally notices)
Help me

Krieger stares at Steinhauser blank-faced for a long moment

SGT KRIEGER
No

BATES (0C)
What have we here
(the others turn to see Bates
striding over)
New toys

In a burst of speed he barges Levy off of Steinhauser and picks
the latter up by the lapels studying the uniform

BATES
A fellow countryman no less

LEVY
He’s a Nazi A filthy lying Nazi prick

BATES
(to Steinhauser in German)
Is that true Have you been a naughty
boy pretending to be English

COL STEINHAUSER
Fuck you

He kicks Bates as hard as he can in the crotch but Bates just
laughs and throws him ten feet into a wall Steinhauser bounces
off and collapses to the ground

BATES
He’s not very nice is he

Levy tries to slip away but finds his path blocked by Warren

WARREN
Someone’s trying to go walkies

BATES

Oh no no I think he’s gonna want to
see this

(Warren drags Levy over to

Bates and Steinhauser)
See my history teacher told me something
interesting about Nazis He said they
had black hearts

(Steinhauser’s eyes widen in fear)
Shall we find out

He bends over

COL STEINHAUSER
Nooo----

-and punches right through Steinhauser’s chest ripping out
his heart Steinhauser stares at it gurgling as the life fades
from his eyes

BATES
Looks red enough to me Guess old teach
was wrong Although
(turns to Levy)
-he also said that Americans didn’t
have any balls Let’s give him another
chance eh

As he steps towards Levy Vickers’s body SLAMS into him
knocking him into a pile of rubble

We whip round to see that Vickers was hurled across the street
by Becca Next to her is Petrovsky holding Vickers’s rifle

PETROVSKY
Jack down

Levy doesn’t need to be told twice He ducks as Petrovsky fires
off a blast of red plasma which incinerates Warren’s entire head
and shoulders

Bates bursts out of the pile of rubble rifle raised

BATES
Enough

He fires off a long stream of tracer bullets which arc through to
air to Petrovsky turning his body to Swiss cheese

Levy dives around a corner as Bates turns the gun on him
ducking rolling and diving to avoid the homing bullets

Vickers charges at Becca as Bates stalks after Levy Krieger
tries to block Vickers but has his back SNAPPED by her knee for
his trouble

Vickers and Becca go at it It’s the ultimate cat fight each
pulling out super-fast moves and blocks

When either one does land a hit it’s devastating sending the
other flying into the nearest solid object

INT OTHER STREETS - STADIUM - CONTINUOUS

Bates chases Levy through the mock-up Iraqi village with homing
bullets and plasma blasts

Levy -- unarmed -- manages to stay just out of harm’s way until
suddenly he finds himself up against the wall of the stadium
with nowhere to go

BATES
No more fun and games

He hurls a shock grenade It hits Levy’s chest and explodes with
blue lightning sending him convulsing to the floor Bates
strides menacingly towards him

BATES
I’m gonna put my fist through your face
yankee boy

Just then Normal’s robot Ralph BURSTS through the wall of the
stadium right behind him followed by Normal Jenner the Viking
and Sir Guy

They see Bates gun in hand standing over Levy’s twitching and
shaking body

NORMAL
Cap

Bates turns and points his rifle at them but before he can fire
the Viking HACKS his arm off with one swipe Bates screams in
pain

Jenner runs over to Levy

JENNER
Cap you okay What’s going on

LEVY
(between spasms)
Kill him

As the Viking swings his sword a second time Bates catches the
blade in mid air and wrenches it round sending the Viking
crashing head-first into the stadium wall

Jenner makes the ‘hand-slicing-throat’ gesture to Normal who
nods and sees to the remote control

Ralph the robot takes a long stride forward pinning Bates under
his foot With a SHUNK-SHUNK his blades extend and Ralph uses
them like scissors to cut off Bates’s head

In the brief moment of calm that follows the new arrivals take
a second to gawp at the spectators in the stadium

Meanwhile Levy tries -- and fails -- to stand up
NORMAL
(running over)
Cap
LEVY
L Leo
NORMAL

The Sarge Where is he
Levy raises a shaking finger pointing

LEVY
Go Quick

Normal bends over and helps Levy up

INT CROSSROADS - STADIUM - MOMENTS LATER

Ralph and co come round the corner to find Becca and Vickers’s
punch-up still going full steam ahead

Vickers brutally round-houses Becca into a wall

Sir Guy draws his sword

SIR GUY
M’ lady

BECCA
Stay back Lancelot I’ve got this one

VICKERS
You think so

Becca hops to her feet and delivers a blistering combination of
blows ending in a thundering left hook which twists Vickers’s
head all the way round snapping her neck with a sickening
crack

BECCA
Yup
(out of breath)
Hey guys What’s up

Levy -- being carried by Ralph -- is starting to regain some
control He notices a smear of blood leading round the corner
from where Petrovsky fell He points

LEVY
Normal there

They follow the smear to find Petrovsky slumped on the ground
near Steinhauser’s body his arm around the football-nuke

LEVY
Leo

He jumps down from the robot and limp-runs over

PETROVSKY
(smiles weakly)
Jack

LEVY
You’re gonna be okay Leo

PETROVSKY
(laughs coughing)
Oh yeah Been hurt worse than this
waxing my ball sack

Levy can’t help but laugh

PETROVSKY
Hey look if things don’t work out

He pats the nuke and gives Levy a meaningful look

LEVY
Yeah

Petrovsky’s eyelids flutter and close Levy looks at him for a
long moment Then notices that the Iraqi village landscape
around him is starting to melt away

Soon it’s all gone leaving Levy Becca Normal Jenner the
Viking Sir Guy and Ralph the robot standing on the empty
stadium floor next to Petrovsky’s body and the nuke

The Controller appears

THE CONTROLLER
Congratulations

LEVY
Fuck you

THE CONTROLLER
You have all fought bravely This has been
a successful new experiment

BECCA
New experiment

THE CONTROLLER

In past versions we simply pushed each
group to fight the others This time we
allowed historical enemies to form
alliances to see what would happen And
pitted friends against one another

(nods to Vickers’s body)
But it always ends in death Very
interesting

LEVY
I’m glad we could amuse you

THE CONTROLLER
In return we have decided to let you go
free

BECCA
You’re going to send us back

THE CONTROLLER
You really want to return to killing in
the name of profit and religion

LEVY
As opposed to what

THE CONTROLLER
Stay here Live in a world of peace Help
us design the next experiment

NORMAL
You don’t have any contestants left

THE CONTROLLER
We can always find new ones Mankind’s
history is full of war

Becca and Levy exchange a look

LEVY
No Send us back

THE CONTROLLER
Very well But we will continue to
observe you All of you

BECCA
I’m not sure I like the sound of that

Levy turns to her

LEVY
Looks like this is goodbye

BECCA
You’re not gonna get all sentimental and
American on me are you

He smiles and starts to lean in towards her but they’re
interrupted by Sir Guy

SIR GUY
Sir Jack It has been a blessing and a
privilege to fight as your servant

Levy smiles at him and does the medieval shoulder-grab handshake
thing Off to the side Normal offers his hand to the Viking for
a high five

NORMAL
What can I say It’s been emotional

The Viking looks at Normal’s hand then ignores it and grabs him
up into a rib-cracking bear hug

THE CONTROLLER
We wish you all good luck

LEVY
Wait Let me take my friend’s body
(looks pointedly at Becca
then at Petrovsky’s body)
Will you help me
She frowns at first but then gets it

BECCA
Right

The move to the body Becca trips over the nuke and bends down to
set it right Levy grabs the Knowledge which is sticking out of
Steinhauser’s pocket

Together they lift up Petrovsky’s bleeding corpse

LEVY
Okay Ready

THE CONTROLLER
Farewell

Just as the blinding white light fills the stadium Becca leans
in and KISSES Levy full on the lips

When the light subsides our heroes are gone The stadium is
silent Well not quite silent There’s a soft regular BEEPING
The Controller sees that it’s coming from the nuke

He bends down to look and sees a timer counting down

4 3 2 1 0

His eyes widen

BOOM The entire stadium is incinerated instantly in a nuclear
firestorm

EXT ROADSIDE - DAY

There’s a brief white flash and Levy finds himself lying on
dusty ground by Petrovsky’s body He sits up rubbing his head

and sees Becca doing the same

LEVY
What the

Looking around he sees Normal Jenner Sir Guy and the Viking
getting up dazed against a background of smoke and flames

A spine-chilling high-pitched whistle cuts through the air
NORMAL
(pointing up)
MORTAR

Time seems to slow Levy looks up to see a black dot falling
through the sky directly towards him getting closer closer

A split second before it his him a hand SNATCHES it out of the
air -- Becca’s She spins it round and hurls it back where it
came from

The TWO INSURGENTS who fired it barely have time to comprehend
what’s going on before they’re obliterated by the explosion

One final INSURGENT jumps up by the side of the road and starts
firing at them with an AK-47

They duck for cover Normal has the only rifle in the group

JENNER
Gimme that

He takes Normal’s M-16 lines up the shot and fires The
unlucky insurgent grows a bullet hole in the forehead and drops
to the ground

There’s a moment of stillness

SIR GUY
What manner of place is this
JENNER
Were back Why’d they send everybody with

us

He’s cut off by a soft whining sound as Normal’s now out-of-
control DRONE SPY PLANE swoops past overhead towards a squat
brown BUILDING

NORMAL
The hostages

LEVY
Malouf

INT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

A dark crowded room Five MASKED GUNMEN guard thirteen
terrified bound-and-gagged HOSTAGES

MALOUF stands -- sword in hand -- in front of a tripod-mounted
camera in a pool the headless FOURTEENTH HOSTAGE’S blood

He says something in Arabic to one of the masked men who drags
a terrified HOSTAGE from the group over to him

Malouf kicks the hostage to the ground in front of the camera
and raises his sword

Suddenly the Drone Plane CRASHES through the ceiling and into
the room

As the dust-covered gunmen pick themselves up a strange group
of people bursts into the room -- three AMERICAN SOLDIERS a
shaven-headed WOMAN in black a burly VIKING and an armor-clad
KNIGHT

For a moment gunmen and hostages alike just stare

LEVY
Nobody move

Ironically this is when the gunmen kick into action
-The FIRST GUNMAN makes the mistake of shooting at Sir Guy The

bullets zing harmlessly off his armor as he charges the man
down slashing his throat open with his sword

The SECOND GUNMAN smartly aims for Jenner but only succeeds in
catching him in the arm with a stray bullet Jenner on the
other hand catches Gunman Number Two in the right eye

The THIRD GUNMAN doesn’t even have a chance to get his finger
on the trigger before the Viking hurls his broadsword It sails
traight through his chest pinning him to the wall

n

-Becca crushes the FOURTH and FIFTH GUNMEN’S heads together as
they try to use a hostage as a human shield

-Finally Levy and Normal charge at Malouf Normal grabs his
wrist before he can swing the sword and Levy tackles him

Lying on top of him rage burning in his eyes Levy digs his
forearm hard into Malouf’s throat strangling him

The others look on disconcerted by the intensity of Levy’s
attack

Levy stares into Malouf’s bulging eyes as he desperately tries
to fight for breath

After a few seconds Malouf’s struggling gets weaker His eyelids
start to droop That’s when Levy catches himself

He screws up his face in anger and frustration and then lets
go just before Malouf loses consciousness

LEVY
Fuck

He gets up and storms out of the room as Malouf weakly sucks new
air into his lungs

Everyone else just stands there panting letting the tension go
as the hostages look curiously at Sir Guy and the Viking

EXT THE SAME BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

Becca walks out of the building to find Levy staring off into
the distance

BECCA
You did the right thing Jack

LEVY
Did I

She puts a hand to his face and turns him to look at her

LEVY
If I’d killed Malouf maybe we could have
stopped a nuclear war If we stopped the
war then maybe your world wont be a
fucking shithole and if we change the
future enough then maybe--

BECCA
Arena will never happen Right But that’s
a lot of maybes Maybe it’s enough that we
caught him Maybe killing’s not the answer
Maybe it’s more important that you’re a
good man

Levy turns away and watches a convoy of US Army trucks and
Humvees approaching in the distance

LEVY
Maybe

He turns back to Becca She leans in to kiss him There’s a
blinding white FLASH OF LIGHT

THE END
