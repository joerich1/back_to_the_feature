INT FRENCH BAKERY - NIGHT

Heavy rainfall POUNDS on an old window pane Amidst the
dripping water you can barely see the village townspeople
running to get home

RICHARD DUBOIS 57 slams a piece of dough on the table and
starts to knead it

His hands move in smooth motions Eyes transfixed never
losing sight of the dough

He keeps kneading in anger and frustration A hypnotic craze
KNOCK KNOCK

Richard wipes his hands on his apron Rolls up his sleeves
Opens the door

MADELEINE 8 with wavy brown hair wears a hooded raincoat
Visage hidden partially by the hood and her hair

RICHARD
(hurriedly)
Can I help you
She looks up Takes off her hood A sweet face
He recognizes her
RICHARD (CONTD)
(frustrated)
MadeleineI

He sighs

Richard motions for her to come in She storms into the
wooden sanctuary Plops down on a stool in the corner

He brings her a red blanket She nods in gratitude her eyes
watering

Richard’s eyebrows no longer furrow He returns to knead
RICHARD (CONTD)
I’m going to have to call your

mother

MADELEINE
But-—
RICHARD
But nothing I know she’s hard on
you I had strict parents but we
always have to respect them

THUNDER strikes nearby

EXT FRENCH BAKERY - NIGHT

Rain pours down the windows as if wax Stragglers hurry
outside to get home

INT FRENCH BAKERY - NIGHT

Three candles are lit Shadows flicker Baked bread protrudes
from brown baskets Rain POUNDS on the window

Richard picks up the phone Dials

INT RUSTIC HOME - NIGHT
RING Old-fashioned telephone shakes

RING Framed photograph on the floor Madeleine and her 37
year-old MOTHER glass-shattered

RING A tattered doll on a shelf

INT FRENCH BAKERY - NIGHT

Richard hangs up annoyed

RICHARD
Youre lucky your mother isn’t
picking up

MADELEINE

(sniffles)
How’d you learn to bake bread

Richard is caught off guard Looks at her perplexed
RICHARD
Well
(pause)
--my dad taught me

Madeleine’s face lights up
MADELEINE

I’ve always wanted a father
RICHARD

He was one of the best bakers in

France
Richard strides to a desk in the corner Opens the middle
drawer Rummages through a pile of papers Pulls out a
leather-bound book
RICHARD (CONTD)
This is my family’s book of
recipes

He holds it against his chest Then hands it to Madeleine

She stares down at its beauty Her eyes are transfixed She
pauses Then opens the book Leafs through the pages

MADELEINE
This is so old

Richard chuckles His eyes beam
RICHARD
Just because something is old
doesn’t mean it can’t be helpful or
insightful

Madeleine nods in gratitude

MADELEINE
Thank you

She rolls her long hair back behind her ear revealing a
bruise near her elbow He grabs her arm

RICHARD
Madeleine what’s this

MADELEINE
Nothing

She snatches her arm away

RICHARD
Madeleine Tell me This is
serious

MADELEINE

It’s nothing honest I just fell
off my bike yesterday

Madeleine’s voice trails off He keeps staring at her arm
Remembering

INT RICHARD’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

A 34 year-old WOMAN slaps an 8 year-old boy’s cheek

A distant echoing sound intervenes -

INT FRENCH BAKERY - NIGHT
Madeleine pokes at the baker

MADELEINE
Mr Dubois

The baker comes back to reality Richard and Madeleine stare
into each other’s eyes

Richard scrunches his eyebrows panting A tear streams down
his cheek Sighing he catches his breath

He takes a soft loaf of bread from a basket Tears it Hands
one half to Madeleine Madeleine takes it Pauses She looks
down at the gift and embraces him

He begins to tear up They pause as they share a moment of
shared vulnerability

MADELEINE (CONT’D)
I think I’d like to learn how to
bake Mr Dubois

Richard sniffles and chuckles

RICHARD
Then you shall my child

They let go of their embrace Richard winks at her

RICHARD (CONTD)
You most definitely shall

FADE OUT
