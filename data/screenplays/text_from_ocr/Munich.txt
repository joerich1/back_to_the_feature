Ephraim watches Avner watch the generals and Harari leave

EPHRAIM
Her sister died but I think she
didnt go to the athletes’ funerals
because some people are angry at
her for not negotiating with the
terrorists She didnt go to the
funerals because she didnt want to
be booed

survival As long as the girl
Scheherazade tells a story she
stays alive For her the stories
are from fantasy The stories of
my people are from memory We tell
them over and over to save
ourselves from oblivion You see
Narrative can have the power to
conquer death

towards Al-Chir who leans over his side of the balcony

flame from the wind lights al-Chir’s cigarette Al-Chir
nods thanks inhales exhales

hotel wall He hauls himself up then leans in He hears al-
Chir moving about singing softly to himself A tap running

himself into bed with a sigh

Avner leans further in He can just see the foot of the bed
and al-Chirs legs sliding under the bedclothes He lowers
himself back to his own balcony goes in his room switches

looks uncomfortable and out of place picking at the food

Next to Robert sitting incongruously on the table is a
little crane exquisitely detailed with a claw hammer
dangling from it Ephraim glances at it from time to time --
everyone else ignores it used to it

EPHRAIM
Its obviously significant
information

STEVE
Abu Yussef He’s like number three
in the whole Palestinian network
it’s like Arafat Habash and him
Of course he’s significant he’s
the brains of the fedayeen

EPHRAIM
(overlapping Steve above
Thanks for the instruction And
the enthusiasm I know who he is

STEVE
Next to Salalmeh Abu Yussuf’s the
worst guy were after right And
and Adwan plans all the actions in
the West Bank right We get the
significance These are serious
targets We want to go to Beirut

EPHRAIM
No You keep out of the Arab
countries Mossad and the army
will take care of it

Gish with he boiled potatoes Robert turns another crank and
the crane’s claw drops into the bowl opening as it descends
Another crank and the claw clamps around a potato Robert
turns cranks and pulls levers until the little crane has
dropped the potato onto his plate Ephraim stares at this
incredulous Then he decides to pretend it didn’t happen
AVNER

STEVE
“Reasonably”

EPHRAIM
You’re spending a lot of money
Well we expected that
The world’s already forgetting
Munich

STEVE
The world forgot before the
athletes were in their graves

EPHRAIM
People are going to find it
difficult connecting these bodies
with the crimes they committed
This is unimaginably risky for
us You understand that yes For
our country Me being here with
you now is risky An operation
like Beirut could become a big
problem

AVNER
Let us do it and it won’t be a
problem

OF Oo OF

Carl and Avner look at one another Carl smiles

EPHRAIM (CONTD)

EPHRAIM

AVNER
I want you to let us do our work

CARL

STEVE
Some of us were always eager
HANS
We’ve reached consensus that this
was a necessary thing to do even
if it stretches the definition of
our mission a bit

AVNER
We want to do what weve promised
to do what we promised you and
Israel and our source

While everyones talking Robert repeats the potato lift with
his crane He drops the potato this time in Ephraim’s plate

Ephraim looks at the potato and then slams his hand down
hard on the table

EPHRAIM

targets Let us do our job

ROBERT
If she turns out to be Leni
Reifenstahl can we kill her

Ephraim looks around the table furious Without a word he
stands grabs his hat and coat and leaves

CARL
Oh well It was a good career

ROBERT

rickety chairs a couple of crates and two stacks of old
mattresses - a pile of five and a pile of four - each pile
tied with hemp Carl counts the mattresses while Hans is
putting cartons of take-out food on one of the crates

Robert is sitting on the floor carefully wiring together
four squat dinged-up rust-spotted cylinders hooking these
up to a remote-controlled fuse and then placing the
contraption into a small suitcase surrounding each device
with newspaper to prevent jostling Four more of the
cylinders more decrepit than the ones Robert’s working on
sit nearby on the floor Steve and Avner watch him

ROBERT

(talking while he works)
When they explode they’1l toss
little white balls of phosphorus
around his room Each ball is like
a little sun It burns at around
5000 degrees The air catches
fire everything melts The bad
news is theyre grenades I’m
altering them to use with a remote
detonator And also I should
mention they’re quite old only
four looked viable Well have to
dump the rest

Avner and Ali are talking quietly

The twenty-year old Palestinian goes to the radio crouches

playing Indian music a woman singing in a high nasal voice

Satisfied he resumes his post staring at Steve

Steve stands goes to the radio crouches turns the dial to

Greek taverna music The Palestinian returns crouches

besides Steve turns the dial back to the Indian station
then looking up at Steve for an instant continues to move
the dial till he finds an English-language station stopping
when he hears the opening notes of The Staple Singers’ “I
know a place” With a terse nod of agreement Steve gets up
goes to the mattress sits and the Palestinian goes back to

his post

Avner and Ali are talking while the radio plays behind them
ALI
Eventually the Arab states will
rise against Israel -- they dont

like Palestinians but they hate
the Jews more It won‘t be like
1967 the rest of the world will
see by then what the Israelis do to
us and they wont help when Egypt
and Syria attack Even Jordan
Israel will cease to exist

Avner doesnt respond They look at each other

AVNER
I guess Only

ALI

AVNER

This is a dream You cant take
back a country you never had

AVNER

(smiling)
Fuck you Im the voice inside
your head telling you what you
know is true Your people have
nothing to bargain with Youll
never get the land back Youll
all die old men in refugee camps
waiting for Palestine”

ALI
(a shrug easy )
We have a lot of children theyll
have children so we can wait
forever and and if we need to
we can make the whole planet unsafe
for Jews

AVNER
You kill Jews and the world feels
bad for them and thinks youre
animals

ALI
Yeah but then the world will see
how theyve made us into animals
(MORE )

ALI (contd)
Theyll start to ask questions
about the conditions in our cages

AVNER
Youre Arabs There are lots of
places for Arabs

ALI
Youre a Jew sympathizer All you
Germans are soft on Israel you

to get their own country How long
did it take the Germans to make
Germany

AVNER
And look how well that worked out

bags full of food bread meat vegetables waiting for the
fishmonger who is standing behind trays of fish on ice
wrapping a huge carp in paper Hes trying to look normal
but his eyes dart this way and that checking out everyone
who comes near him giving away whats becoming a habitual
unconscious panicked paranoid

As Avner waits we hear Hans’s voice

clear smoke and amber thick wavy bevelled The room
within is panelled with mirrors set at odd angles and
mirrored doors that swing open and close catching and losing
reflections A row of big crystal chandeliers down the length

A number of Arab men perhaps as many as twenty are moving

large wooden boxes around Theyre rendered cubist fragments

Salameh suddenly stops talking takes a deep drag on his
cigarette -- and then he seems to look straight out the
french doors of the library out through their panes of
distorting colored glass out into the dark as if seeking
out and then locking directly with Avner’s gaze

One of the mirrored doors behind Salameh opens then another
then another and all at once the face in the binoculars is
repeated over and over full face profile rear view
staring hard at something -- it seems to be Avner -- with a
strange expression familiarity hatred taunting

CUT BACK T0236

STEVE
Too many men We’re gonna get
killed

They hear a sound of someone walking on gravel coming from
the garden behind them They go completely flat and roll
deeper into the shadows Avner leaves the binoculars on the
grass They unsling their rifles and release the safeties

A man is standing with his back to them taking a leak He
has a kalashnikov slung across his back

Avner sees the binoculars in the verge of the terrace He
taps Steve and points

Steve mouths a silent shit then starts to inch towards the
binoculars The peeing man is finished hes zipping up his
fly Steves elbow snaps something dry in the grass

The man wheels around Its a teenage boy fourteen or
fifteen years old The boy sees Avner and Steve He starts
to fumble for his kalashnikov Steve is already on his feet
taking aim Avner close behind him

Steve fires then Avner one bullet knocking the kid off his
feet the other hitting him in the eye making his head
explode His body topples back into the bushes

Avner and Steve hear shouts coming from inside the house
Someone in the dining room flings the door opens and calls
out something in Arabic They crouch edging back into the
shadows Suddenly theres a burst of machine-gun fire
sending stone and gravel and dirt flying

Steve starts to run back towards the shore Avner catches
his arm spins him around and drags him in the opposite
direction Avner runs in this direction and Steve follows

As they approach the main gates Avner trips stumbles
cutting his face He sits there stunned Steve hauls him to
his feet and they resume their run to the gate

Avner fires at the center of the locked gate while Steve
turns and fires several rounds into the blackness behind
them

AVNER
GO

Both men run at the two halves and crash into them The
gates burst open and Avner and Steve run pell-mell down the
drive Noises of pursuit running shouting from within the
compound grow closer Theres a burst of gunfire nearby
Avner and Steve run down the road at top speed

No one is pursuing They keep running

CLOSE UP
Avner runs as wed seen him at the start of the sequence
face blacked bloody cut sweat terror He plunges into the
grass field He runs through the grass

He throws his rifle away into the grass and runs

His speed accelerates He runs till the world falls away It
is no longer clear where he is

The camera closes in on Avner’s eyes
