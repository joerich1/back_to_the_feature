the silence is total except for the whine of a dry
wine blowing in from the distantly heard sea Over this
desolaticn we HEAR the NARRATOR

NARRATORS VOICE
(os)
This is the truth eternal whatever
thinks can speak And whetever
speaks can murder

But what is there to murder in this dead place

NARRATORS VOICE
(os)

When the astronaut Taylor came
first among us from a voyage in
outermost space he perceived that
his ship had passed through a fold
in the Fourth Dimension which is
Time And Teylor knew that he was
older than when his journey had
begun by two thousand years and
ten

A pause in which the wind whines higher and louder
before dropping again behind

NARRATORS VOICE

(o8)
But in the first days he did not
know the name of tne strange planet
on which he had set foot -- where
Apes (risen to great estate) had
acquired the power of tongues while
Man (fallen from his zenith to become
a beast of the earth) had lost the
means of speech and was dumb

Set this down Taylor hated war
And since the Apes of those times
were fighting a bestial war-with-
weapons to exterminate peaceful

and defenceless Man Taylor believed
that Man was the more worth saving

We catch our first sight of the sea -- a Dead Sea like
the Dead Land

NARRATORS VOICE

Only when Taylor and his woman
were at last driven from the
City of the Apes into the wilder-
ness called the Forbidden Zone

mysterious rock formation during

rock and stone -- barren unfruitful
devoid of life and eternally laid
waste by Mans vilest war in Mans

Dumbfounded TAYLOR slides from his horses saddle
approaches the spikes NOVA dismounts too and follows
him

TAYLOR
( ery of agony)
God damn you all to hell
He falls to his knees buries his head in his hands
CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS BACK AND UP to a HIGH-ANGLE SHOT
disclosing what TAYLOR has seen Half-buried in the sand
and washed by the waves is the Statue of Liberty

SPECIAL EFFECT I - THE WALL OF FIRE - DAY

NOVA plucks TAYLORS arm and points urgently at The
Wall of Fire

It could have started believably in the distant scrub
but it advances unbelievably across the bare rock and
sand -- cutting directly across his route to buried

New York above and screening it from view We cross-
cut fire with

TAYLOR
(mystified)
Whatwhat the hells feeding it
Theres nothing to burn

The horse too has seen the fire heard it and now U-
turns violently away from the crackling screen of flame
at a gallop which takes them out of harms range As the
horse slows TAYLOR looks behind him and up at the slope
which they have just descended New York is hidden below
the horizon

He looks ahead and about him

TAYLOR
Well reach it another way

repeated attempts to meke a flank spproech on New York

ourselves infected by those enormous
parasites which we call Humansby
parasites who devoured the fruits
that we had planted in a land rightly
ours who fattened on the fertility
of fields that we had made green with
wheat who polluted the pure and precious
water of our lakes and rivers with their

is Power Naked merciless Force

Todey the bestial Hunan herds have
at last been systematically flushed
from their feeding grcunds No
single Human Being has escaped our

they sre in our cages -- condemend
to die

A low growl of applause inflates his rhetoric

URSUS
I do not say that all Humans sare evil
simply because their skin is white
But our Lawgiver tells us that never
will they have the Aves divine
faculty for distinguishing between
Evil and Good Their eyes are animal
their smell she smell of the dead
flesh they eat Had they been allowed
to live and breed among us unchecked
they would heve overwhelmed us And the
concept of Ave Power would have become
meaningless and our high and splendid
culture -- would have wasted away and
our civilization would have been ravaged

augmented toward the searches end by the blowing of a

well (for their path has begun to slope upwards) deceive

four other INQUISITORS robed in different colors a

The remaining chair (on MENDEZ’ right) is occupied by a
green-robed Elder Statesman charming cheerful

The INQUISITORS sit high up egainst the curved white
wall of a room shaped like and semicircular amphitheater
If they look down they can see BREXT standing between
GUARDS in the well of the hall below If they look
level they can intermittently see their ow thoughts
projected onto the straight white wall ahead which
receives the visual impress of their thought projections
Each image (sometimes they are quite separate sometimes
they overla to some degree) is projected in the color
matching the sender -- the NEGROs in white the

FAT MANs in red etc This is the physical setup for
an Interrogation Extraordinary whose conduct requires

APRELIMINARY NOTE
Tne INQUISITORS will mix the following techniques

a Non-visuel thoucht projection BRENT will answer

questions waich we have not heard spoken Convention
the questions are signalled by an unassertive little
jerk forward of an INQUISITORs head (a sort of nod cut
short) as though the questioner were throwing his
query at the prisoner

bd Visual thought projecreor Used by the INQUISITORS
among themselves only has his back to the
projection wall and cannot without turning around see
what the INQUISITORS are thinking Convention An
INQUISITOR merely raises his eyes tcwards the wall -- on
which the projected thought image instantly appears in
the color of his (or her) robes In the NEGROs case
this would be white

co The spoken word -- to which MENDEZ and CASPAY (in
particulier) wild rescrt when BRENT under intensive
questioning begins mentally to tire

ad Traumatic hycnosis Used ruthlessly on BRENT when
he is unduly stuboorn By thought csansference (as we
have elready seen) the INQUISITORS can hurt him
physically or mentally Convention The practitioner

merely closes his eyes and Bohl remains in pain until
the eyes are reopened

His voice is heard among them

MENDEZ presses the second topaz button It glows yellow

URSUS

The SOLDIERS seize MENDEZ

At the same time the Bomb begins to rise very slowly --
in response to the topaz button - on what we recognize
to be the launching pad

URSUS
Your God didnt save you did he

He motions to the SOLDIERS They strangle MENDEZ with
his own clothing Meanwhile the Bomb continues to
rise to position URSUS laughs sardonically snatches
machine gun and aims it at the Bomb

And now es if the projected film itself were caught in
the universal fire we see the final celluloid image begin
to melt and burn Over this

We must now ‘record the final event
of this somber history

The projected celluloid image browns and blackens and
shrinks We hear (perhass) an electronic crackling as
of a distant fire

NARRATORS VOICE

The Universe at present contains
billions upor billions of spiral
galaxies Ir one of them one-third
from the edge is a medium-sized
star

Only a small dlackened wisp remains of the projected image
The electronic burning noise dwindles to a sputter
growing more and more distant

and insignificant planet --

The sound has receded into infinite silence The screen
