INT CORPORATE OFFICE HIGH-RISE - BACK-BAY BOSTON - DAY

We float over a large corporate office a grid of cubicles
slides under us perfect symmetrical-- EMPLOYEES working at
desks milling in and around the cubicles--

We slide toward the outside walls-- light bathes in from the
windows reflections curve off glass-dividers setting off
the nicer offices--

CUT TO

INT JOHNS OFFICE - DAY
One of the nicer offices glassed-in-- at the desk

JOHN HUME 40s-- tie shirtsleeves glasses perched--
company man polished not overly-so-- pores over
spreadsheets marking them up--

The spreadsheets-- columns of numbers arc graceful-- John
sifts through decimal-chains crossing out-- shakes his head--
then he sees something a pattern in the chains-- he circles
a long rising line-- half smiles--

We see headings DEATHS NATURAL DEATHS MISHAP CHILD
FATALITIES ACTS OF GOD MARRIED SINGLE NUMBER OF CHILDREN--
FATALITY CLAIMS PAID DENIED-- he circles another chain--

JOHN
(quietly-- amused)
Huh-- there you go--

John looks up-- AMY his assistant the EMPLOYEES out on the
floor working joking all ages men women-- happy busy
numbers--

KEVIN-- 30 appears at his door file in hand--

KEVIN
Bother you

John-- back at his numbers-- smiles--
JOHN
Just when you think theres no
order anywhere theres order
looking right at you--

Kevin-- not following--
KEVIN
Oh-- right--

John looks at Kevins file Kevin brings it-- John scans--

JOHN
What do you need here

KEVIN
Annie said I need you to approve
this no beneficiaries wife dead--
no kids-- easy-peasy--

John looks up on easy-peasy-- he doesn’t sign it-- closes
the file pushes it--

KEVIN (contd)
But-- theres no estate-- the
lawyers got dementia--

JOHN
I saw that So-- what do we do

KEVIN
(galled)
Dont make me file with the state--
for a twenty-five-hundred dollar
policy

John bristles-- Kevin sees it--

JOHN
We file with the state So one
day in the unlikely event somebody
looks back at this guys death
theyll know we did our job

KEVIN
(scoops up the file)
Oh-- we cover our asses duh-- got
it sorry--

JOHN
No-- we do our job

Kevin-- chastised-- John smiles--

JOHN (contd)
And we cover our asses for when the
illegitimate children show up--
KEVIN
(looks)
I didnt see-- illegitimates-—-

JOHN
Well illegitimate children will
leap into being and sue us pantless
if you dont give enough of a shit
about their dad to put on record
that we in the office of life and
death made an effort to pay
somebody twenty-five hundred bucks
in compensation for his passing--

John picks up his spreadsheet again-- smiles at Kevin--

JOHN (contd)
-- lest he die in vain OK
(back in his numbers)
Might even make some poor bastard
feel better

Kevin-- excused-- hesitates nods at the spreadsheets--

KEVIN
Whats the order-in-the-universe
thing

John-- poring over it--

JOHN
We spent three hundred thousand
bucks for these guys to make us
this new model new field-data new
society who-dies-when-and-how--
but they screwed up all the decimal
weights Its three-hundred
thousand bucks worth of dogshit--

Kevin-- following as best he can--

JOHN (contd)
But even so it says people with
kids live longer than people with
no kids people with two live
longer than people with one--
(flipping pages)

Smoking is bad-- speeding is bad
Divorce is bad Deaths in the
family are bad

John smiles--
JOHN (contd)
Its nice to see all that craps
still true If you have twenty
kids anyway So youd better
drive home under the speed-limit
and get busy with that

KEVIN
(smiles)
Ive got my illegitimates

snapping cartridges like a pro-- re-loading one-handed-- he
does it over and over-- until he looks half-masterful-- and
all the way deadly--
