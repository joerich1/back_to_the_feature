FADE IN
EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

A gray impenetrable wall of fog From somewhere comes the
FAINT SOUND of a LITTLE GIRLS VOICE singing slow tempo
almost under her breath

YOUNG ELIZABETH (0S)
Yo ho yo ho a pirates life for me
Yo ho yo ho its a pirates life
for me

Suddenly a massive SHIP emerges from the grey the Winged
Victory maidenhead looming Its a British dreadnought
the HMS Dauntless Formidable frightening twenty-five
gun ports on a side and rail guns to boot

EXT HMS DAUNTLESS - FORECASTLE - DAY

ELIZABETH SWANN strawberry blond hair stands at the bow
railing gazing at the seas still singing --

ELIZABETH
drink up me hearties yo ho

JOSHAMEE GIBBS who was born old skin a dark leather
clutches her shoulder startling her

GIBBS
(sotto)
Quiet missy Cursed pirates sail
these waters You want to call
em down on us

Elizabeth stares wide-eyed at him

NORRINGTON
Mr Gibbs

NORRINGTON a dashing young man Royal Navy to the core
glares sternly at Gibbs Standing besides him is GOVERNOR
WEATHERBY SWAN a man of obvious high station brass
buttons on his thick blue jacket He is Elizabeths
father

NORRINGTON (CONTD)
That will do

GIBBS
She was singing about pirates
Bad luck to sing about pirates
with us mired in this unnatural
fog-- mark my words

NORRINGTON
Consider them marked On your
way

GIBBS

Aye Captain

(as he moves off)
Bad luck to have a woman on board
too Even a miniture one

He returns to his deck-swabbing duties surreptitiously
takes a quick swig from flask

ELIZABETH
I think it would be rather
exciting to meet a pirate

NORRINGTON
Think again Miss Swan Vile and
dissolute creatures the lot of
them I intend to see to it that
any man who sails under a pirate
flag or wears a pirates brand
gets what he deserves a short
drop and a sudden stop

Elizabeth doesnt know what a short drop and a sudden
stop means Gibbs helpfully mimes a man being hung

SWAN
Captain Norrington I appreciate
your fervor but I am concerned about
the effect this subject will have on
my daughter

NORRINGTON
My apologies Governor

ELIZABETH
Actually I find it all fascinating

SWAN

And thats what concerns me Elizabeth
dear we will be landing in Port
Royal very soon and beginning our new
lives Wouldnt it be wonderful if we
comport ourselves as befits our class
and station
ELIZABETH
Yes father

Chastised she turns away to look out over the bow rail

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
(to herself)
I still think it would be exciting
to meet a pirate

The fog still hems in the ship very little of the sea is
visible --

-- but suddenly a FIGURE comes into view A young boy
WILL TURNER floating on his back in the otherwise empty
water There is nothing to show where he came from or how
he came to be there

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Look A boy In the water

Norrington and Swann spot him --

NORRINGTON
Man overboard

ELIZABETH
Boy overboard

NORRINGTON
Fetch a hook Haul him out of
there

Quick movement and activity on the deck Sailors use a
boathook to snag the boy he the passes Norrington and
Swann haul him aboard and lay him on the deck Elizabeth
sidles in for a closer look

NORRINGTON (CONTD)
Hes still breathing

SWAN
Where did he come from

GIBBS
Mary mother of God

Attention is turned away from the boy --

The sea is no longer empty WRECKAGE from a ship litters
the water along with the bodies of its crew What is
left of the ships hull BURNS a ragged British flag
hanging limply from the stern

The HMS Dauntless slips silently through it all The
scene calls for hushed voices

SWAN
What happened here

NORRINGTON
An explosion in the powder magazine
Merchant vessels run heavily armed

GIBBS
Lot of good it did them
(off Swans look)
Everyones thinking it Im just
saying it Pirates

SWAN
There is no proof of that It could
have been an accident Captain these
men were protection If there is even
the slightest chance one of those poor
devils is still alive we cannot
abandon them

NORRINGTON

Of course not Governor

(to the crew)
Come about and strike the sails Unlash
the boats Gunnery crew jackets off
the cannons

(to Swann)
Hope for the bestprepare for
the worst

(to two sailors)
Move the boy aft Well need the
deck clear

They lift the boy Swann pulls Elizabeth away from the
rail away from the hideous scene in the water

SWAN
Elizabeth I want you to accompany
the boy Hes in your charge now
Youll watch over him

Elizabeth nods gravely Swann hurries away to help unstow
the longboat The sailors lay the boy gently on the poop
deck behind the wheel then hurry off Elizabeth kneels
down besides the boy

His good looks are not lost on her She reaches out
gently brushes the blond hair from his eyes --

Suddenly he grabs her wrist awake now Elizabeth is
startled but their eyes lock She takes his hand in hers

ELIZABETH
My name is Elizabeth Swann

WILL
Will Turner

ELIZABETH
Im watching over you Will

He clutches her hands then slips back into
unconsciousness

His movement has opened the collar of his shirt Elizabeth
sees he wears a chain around his neck She tugs it free
revealing--

A GOLD MEDALLION One side is blank She turns it over --

A SKULL gazes up at her Vaguely Aztec in design but to
her eyes it means one thing only

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Youre a pirate

She glances back at the crew Sees Norrington giving
orders moving toward her

She looks back at Will -- comes to a quick decision Takes

the medallion from around his neck Hides it under her
coat

Norrington arrives

NORRINGTON
Did he speak

ELIZABETH
His name is Will Turner -- thats

all I found out

NORRINGTON
Very good

Norrington hurries off Elizabeth steals away to the stern
of the ship Examines her prize -- the gold medallion A
wisp of wind and she looks up --

Out over the sea moving through the fog silent as a
ghost is a large sailing ship a schooner --

It has BLACK SAILS

Elizabeth stares too frightened to move or cry out

The ship is obscured by the fog it as it passes -- but not
the mizzen-top and there hangs the frightening skull

and crossbones of the Jolly Roger

Elizabeth looks from it to the medallion -- the skull on
the flag is the same as the one on the medallion

Fog surrounds and closes in on the black ship -- except for
the black flag As Elizabeth watches the skull appears to
TURN and GRIN at her --
Elizabeth shuts her eyes tight --

EIGHT YEARS LATER
INT GOVERNORS MANSION - ELIZABETHS BEDROOM
-- and then snap open again startled wide with fear
But this is no longer twelve-year-old Elizabeth standing on
the stern of the Dauntless this is twenty-year-old

Elizabeth lying in bed in the dark

She remains motionless (were the images we just saw a
nightmare or a jumbled childhood memory

Elizabeth slowly looks as far out the corner of her eyes as
possible without moving Might there be someone in the
room with her looming over her

She turns ready for anything She is alone

Elizabeth sits up turns up the flame on an oil lamp
besides the canopied bed She carries the lamp across the
room to a dressing table sits down

She pulls one of the small drawers all the way out reaches
into a space beneath it and removes --

The MEDALLION She has kept it all this time It has not
lost its luster -- or its sense of menace She gazes at it
as she absently returns the draw to its place --
A BOOMING knock on the door Elizabeth jumps up startled
knocking over her chair

SWANN (0S)
Elizabeth Is everything all
right Are you decent

ELIZABETH
Yes -- yes

She puts the medallion on throws on a dressing gown as
Swann enters carrying a large box A uniformed maid
ESTRELLA follows

SWANN
Still abed at this hour Its a
beautiful day

Estrella pulls back the heavy curtains revealing

Beneath a blue sky lies the bucolic town of PORT ROYAL
built on a natural harbor On a bluff at the mouth of the
harbor stands FORT CHARLES its stone parapets lined with
cannon

SWANN (CONTD)
I have a gift for you

He opens the boxes and displays for her a gorgeous velvet
dress She lets out an admiring gasp

ELIZABETH

Its -- beautiful May I inquire
as to the occasion

SWANN
Is an occasion necessary for a father
to dote upon his daughter with gifts

Elizabeth happily takes it disappears behind a screened-
off dressing area Estrella follows carrying the box

SWANN (CONTD)
AlthoughI did think you could
wear it to the ceremony today

ELIZABETH (0S)
Ceremony

SWANN
Captain Norringtons promotion
ceremony

Elizabeth peeks around the screen

ELIZABETH
I knew it

SWANN
Or rather Commodore Norringtona
fine gentleman dont you think
(no answer)
He fancies you you know

Behind the screen Elizabeth GASPS

SWANN (CONTD)

Elizabeth Hows it coming
ON ELIZABETH -- She holds her hair and the medallion (still
around her neck) out of the way as the maid cinches her
into a corset over her slip Estrella has her foot in
Elizabeths back as she pulls the laces tight
ELIZABETH
Difficult to say

SWANN (0S)
Im told that dress is the very latest
fashion in London

ELIZABETH
(holding her breath)
Women in London must have learned to
not breath

Estrella is finished Elizabeth takes a breath -- and
winces

A butler appears in the doorway of the room

BUTLER
Governor A caller is here for
you

INT GOVERNORS MANSION - FOYER - DAY

The caller dressed in rough clothing stands in the foyer
looking very out of place and knowing it He holds a long
presentation case He polishes the toes of his boots on
the back of his calves but it doesnt help
SWANN
Ah Mr Turner Its good to see
you again

The caller turns -- it is WILL TURNER Handsome with a
watchful demeanor that gives him weight beyond his years

WILL
Good day sir
(holds out the case)
I have your order

Swann hurries to him opens the case Inside is a
beautiful dress sword and scabbard Swann takes it out
reverently

WILL (CONTD)

WILL (CONTD)
The blade is folded steel Thats
gold filigree laid into the
handle If I may -

He takes the sword from Swann and balances it on one
finger at the point where the blade meets the guard

WILL (CONTD)

Perfectly balanced The tang is nearly
the full width of the blade

SWANN
Impressive very impressive
Commodore Norrington will be pleased
Im sure Do pass my compliments on to
your master

Wills face falls Clearly the work is his and he is
proud of it With practiced ease he flips the sword
around catches it by the hilt and returns it to the case

WILL
(bows slightly)
I shall A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated --

He stops speaking abruptly staring past Swann -

Elizabeth stands on the stairs Granted the dress may be
painful to wear but holy smokes

SWANN
Elizabeth You look stunning

Will tries to speak but cant He gives up smiles to
himself and simply nods emphatically

ELIZABETH
Will Its so good to see you

Her hand goes to the chain around her throat (the medallion
is hidden in the bodice of her dress)

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
I dreamt about you last night
Will reacts with surprise
Really

SWANN
Elizabeth this is hardly
appropriate -

ELIZABETH
(ignores her father)
About the day we met Do you
remember

WILL
I could never forget it Miss
Swann

ELIZABETH
Will how many times must I ask
you to call me Elizabeth

WILL
At least once more Miss Swann As
always

Elizabeth is disappointed and a little hurt by his
response

SWANN
Well said Theres a boy who
understands propriety Now we must be
going

Swann takes the case from Will opens the door for
Elizabeth

Elizabeth straightens her back gathers her skirts and
strides past Will

ELIZABETH
Good day Mr Turner
EXT GOVERNORS MANSION - DAY
Swann follows Elizabeth out the door

WILL
Good day

He watches as she is helped aboard a carriage by the
driver

WILL (CONTD)
(to himself)
Elizabeth

IN THE CARRIAGE Swann glowers at his daughter

SWANN
Dear I do hope you demonstrate a bit
more decorum in front of Commodore
Norrington After all it is only

through his efforts that Port Royal has
become at all civilized

EXT PORT ROYAL - HARBOR - DAY

The skeletal remains of four pirates still clad in
buccaneer rags hang from gallows erected on a rocky
promontory There is a fifth unoccupied gallows bearing a
sign

PIRATES - YE BE WARNED

The top of a billowing sail passes regally in front of
them On the landward face of the sail apparently high in
the rigging is a man for whom the term swashbuckling
rogue was coined Captain JACK SPARROW

He gazes keen-eyed at the display as they pass Raises a
tankard in salute Suddenly something below catches his
attention He jumps from the rigging -

-- and thats when we see that his is ship is not an
imposing three-master but just a small fishing dory with a
single sail plowing through the water -- the Jolly Mon
And it leaks Which is why he has the tankard to bail

Jack steps back to the tiller and using a single sheet to
control the sail and the Jolly Mon comes around the
promontory the whole of Port Royal laid out before him

The huge British dreadnought HMS Dauntless dominates
the bay But Jacks attention is on a different ship the
HMS Interceptor a small sleek vessel with rail guns and
a mortar in the middle of the main deck It is tied up at
the Navy landing at the base of the cliffs below Fort
Charles

EXT PORT ROYAL - DOCKS - DAY

Smoothly and with no wasted movement Jack hauls down the
sail stows it guides the dory alongside a dock The
HARBORMASTER a long ledger tucked under his arm is there
to catch a line and help Jack tie up

HARBORMASTER
If youre out rolling scuppers in
this tub youre either incredibly
brave or incredibly stupid

JACK
Its remarkable how often those
two traits coincide

He starts up the dock strapping on his sword belt besides
the scabbard it also carries a compass pistol and small
powder horn The Harbormaster cuts him off

HARBORMASTER
Its a shilling for the dock
space and youre going to have to
give me your name

JACK
What do you say to three
shillings and we forget the name

He tosses three shillings onto the ledger The Harbormaster
considers then shuts the ledger on the coins steps aside

HARBORMASTER
Welcome to Port Royal Mr Smith

Jack gives him a half-salute as he goes past Looks across
the water toward the Interceptor -- and smiles Above the
Interceptor among the parapets of Fort Charles a ceremony
is underway -

EXT FORT CHARLES - DAY

With choreographed precision Swann removes the sword and
scabbard from the presentation case held by a uniformed
Navy man He slides the sword into the scabbard holds it
out vertically to Norrington in full dress uniform

Norrington grasps the scabbard above Swanns hand and
Swann lets go Norrington draws the sword flourishes the
sword and snaps the blade up in front of his face Swann
steps forward pins a medal to Norringtons jacket steps
back

Norrington nods turns smartly and nods to his fellow
officers turns again and nods to the audience -
dignitaries merchants plantation owners their families
Another flourish and he returns the sword to its scabbard

The silence is broken by loud APPLAUSE Backslapping from
the Navy men

In the audience Elizabeth doesnt look so good out
beneath the hot sun She applauds briefly then winces
Discreetly tries to adjust the corset through the material
of the dress then resumes clapping trying to hide her
discomfort

EXT PORT ROYAL - NAVY DOCK - DAY

Two sailors on sentry duty MURTOGG and MULLROY take
advantage of what little shade there is on the dock But
when Jack saunters up they are immediately on alert

MURTOGG
This dock is off-limits to
civilians

JACK
Sorry I didnt know

Music drifts down from Fort Charles Jack looks up shields
his eyes

JACK (CONTD)
Some sort of to-do up at the fort eh
You two werent invited

MURTOGG
No someone has to make sure
this dock stays off-limits to
civilians

JACK

This must be some important boat
MULLROY
Ship

JACK
Ship

MURTOGG
Captain Norringtons made it his
flagship Hell use it to hunt
down the last dregs of piracy on
the Spanish Lake

MULLROY
Commodore

MURTOGG
Right Commodore Norrington

JACK
Thats a fine goal Im sure But it
seems to me a ship like that --
(indicates the Dauntless)
-- makes this one here just a wee

superfluous

MURTOGG
Oh the Dauntless is the power in
these waters true enough -- but

theres no ship that can match the
Interceptor for speed

JACK
That so Ive heard of one supposed to
be fast nigh uncatchable the Black

Pearl
Mullroy scoffs at the name

MULLROY
Theres no real ship as can match
the Interceptor

MURTOGG
The Black Pearl is a real ship

MULLROY
No its not

MURTOGG
Yes it is Ive seen it

MULLROY
Youve seen it

MURTOGG
Yes

MULLROY
Youve seen the Black Pearl

MURTOGG
Yes

MULLROY
You havent seen it

MURTOGG
Yes I have

MULLROY
Youve seen a ship with black sails
thats crewed by the damned and
captained by a man so evil that hell
itself spat him back out

MURTOGG
No

MULLROY
No

MURTOGG
But Ive seen a ship with black sails

MULLROY
Oh and no ship thats not crewed by
the damned and captained by a man so
evil hell itself spat him back out
could possibly have black sails and
therefore couldnt possibly be any ship
other than the Black Pearl Is that
what youre saying

MURTOGG
no

MULLROY
(turns back to Jack)
Like I said theres no real ship
as can match -- Hey

But Jacks not there Murtogg and Mullroy look around spot
Jack standing at the wheel of the Interceptor casually
examining the mechanism

MULLROY (CONTD)
You

Jack looks over in exaggeratedly innocent surprise The
sailors hurry toward the gangplank

MULLROY (CONTD)
Get away from there You dont
have permission to be aboard
there

Jack spreads his hands in apology

JACK
Im sorry Its just such a pretty
boat Ship

The sailors study him suspiciously

MURTOGG
Whats your name

JACK
Smith

MULLROY
Whats your business in Port
Royal Mr Smith

MURTOGG
And no lies

JACK
None Very well Youve rumbled
me I confess I intend to
commandeer one of these ships
pick up a crew in Tortuga and go
out on the account do a little
honest pirating

MURTOGG
I said no lies

MULLROY
I think hes telling the truth

MURTOGG
Hes not telling the truth
MULLROY
He may be

MURTOGG
If he were telling the truth he
wouldnt have told us

JACK
Unless of course he knew you wouldnt
believe the truth if he told it to you

Murtogg and Mullroy consider that point --
EXT FORT CHARLES - DAY

Elizabeth pale and perspiring fans herself weakly
oblivious to the music and chatter

NORRINGTON
May I have a moment

He extends his arm She takes it He walks her away from
the party toward the parapet A rather too long of a
silence as Norrington works up his courage

NORRINGTON (CONTD)
(a burst)
You look lovely Elizabeth

Elizabeth frowns unable to focus Norrington mistakes her
expression as disapproval

NORRINGTON (CONTD)
I apologize if I seem forward --
but I must speak my mind

NORRINGTON (CONTD)

(working up his

confidence to do so)
This promotion confirms that I have
accomplished the goals I set for myself
in my career But it also casts into
sharp relief that which I have not
achieved The thing all men most
require a marriage to a fine woman

(beat)
You have become a fine woman
Elizabeth

ELIZABETH
I cant breathe

NORRINGTON
(smiles)

Im a bit nervous myself --
Elizabeth loses her balance stumbles away from Norrington
She reaches a hand out to the parapet to steady herself
but it slides off -

-- and then she vanishes over the wall Gone

NORRINGTON (CONTD)
Elizabeth

EXT PORT ROYAL - NAVY DOCKS - DAY
Jack reacts pushes Murtogg aside to see -

Elizabeth plummets from the top of the cliff It seems to
take her a long time to reach the sea --

Elizabeth hits the water narrowly missing the sharp rocks
A wave breaks and then she is washed out away from the
cliff struggling feebly

AT THE FORT Norrington looks down --

NORRINGTON ELIZABETH

He leaps to the top of the parapet prepared to dive -- a
lieutenant GILLETTE catches his arm

GILLETTE
The rocks sir Its a miracle she
missed them

Norrington shakes off his arm looks down -- and realizes
Gillette is right He jumps down and runs --

EXT PORT ROYAL - NAVY DOCKS - DAY

Jack Murtogg and Mullroy are still in shock from the
sight

JACK
Arent you going to save her

MULLROY
I cant swim
Murtogg shakes his head -- neither does he

JACK
(rolls his eyes)
Sailors

Above where Elizabeth struggles in the water Norrington
and several other men pick their way down the cliffs They
are too far away to get to her in time

Jack scowls He has no choice -- and it pisses him off

JACK (CONTD)
Fine

He pulls a pistol from his sword belt hands it to Murtogg
then hands the belt to Mullroy

JACK (CONTD)
Dont lose these

And then he dives into the water swims toward Elizabeth

Elizabeth struggles to keep above water gasping for air -
then a swell rolls over her and she is submerged -

UNDERWATER Elizabeth drifts down unconscious The current
turns her and the MEDALLION slips loose from her bodice

The MEDALLION turns slowly until the SKULL is fully
visible A shaft of filtered sunlight hits it and it
GLINTS -

EXT PORT ROYAL - VARIOUS - DAY

FORT CHARLES The British flag flies blown from an
offshore breeze Suddenly the wind dies and the flag goes
limp

ON THE DOCKS Wood and metal fittings on lines bang against
masts The wind dies and there is silence

ON THE EDGE OF TOWN A CARIBE WOMAN feeds clucking
chickens frowns when they all suddenly go quiet

IN THE VILLAGE A weather vane moves slightly in the wind
The wind stops and all is still And then

the weather vane TURNS and holds steady -- the wind
has picked up again but now blows from the sea toward the
land

1)ON THE BEACH an OLD SALT pulls a rope line pauses
Turns and gazes to the sky frowning The mangy hound at
his side starts BARKING incessantly -

ON THE DOCKS The lines bang against the other sides of the
masts the wind far stronger now

FORT CHARLES the British flag flies in the opposite
direction snapping in the new onshore breeze

EXT PORT ROYAL - CLIFFSIDE - DAY

Norrington rushes down intent on the climb Beyond him
past the rocky point far out to sea FOG gathers -

EXT PORT ROYAL - OCEAN - DAY

UNDERWATER the medallion hangs below Elizabeths unmoving
form - - and then Jack is there He wraps an arm around her
and makes for the surface

ON THE SURFACE Jack swims toward the dock struggling It
is far more difficult than it should be He stops
stroking and they submerge

UNDERWATER Jack realizes that it is Elizabeths heavy
velvet dress that is weighing them down He pulls at the
buttons on the back and they give way He skins her out of
the dress and kicks away from it

The dress falls like a cloud into darkness -

ON THE SURFACE Jack swims with Elizabeth much more
quickly

AT THE DOCK Murtogg and Mullroy are there to help haul
Elizabeth out of the water

Jack climbs up exhausted Elizabeth is on her back
Murtogg holds her arms above her head pumping them

Mullroy puts his cheek to her nose and mouth

MULLROY
Not breathing

Murtogg looks down it seems hopeless Jack steps up
drawing Murtoggs knife from its sheath

JACK

Move
He pushes past Mullroy kneels over Elizabeth raises the
knife -- Murtogg is shocked -

Jack slits the corset down the middle yanks it away

Elizabeth remains still And then -- she coughs up water
and gasps choking on her first full breath Jack is
relieved

MULLROY
I never would have thought of
that

JACK
Clearly youve never been to
Singapore

Jack flips the knife and hands it hilt-first to Murtogg -
and thats when he spots -

The MEDALLION Jack catches it up in his hand

JACK (CONTD)
Where did you get this

Before Elizabeth can answer the BLADE of a SWORD is at
Jacks THROAT -- Norringtons new ceremonial sword in
fact looking bright and sharp

NORRINGTON
On your feet

It looks bad -- Jack standing over Elizabeth most of her
clothes gone He gets to his feet The rest of Elizabeths
erstwhile rescuers reach the scene including Swann

SWANN
Elizabeth Are you all right

He strips off his jacket drapes it around her

ELIZABETH
Yes -- yes Im fine -- Commodore
Norrington do you intend to kill
my rescuer

Norrington looks at Jack Jack nods as best he can with a
blade beneath his chin Norrington sheathes his sword and
extends his hand

NORRINGTON
I believe thanks are in order
Jack takes Norringtons hand gingerly They shake -

-- and Norrington tightens his grip yanks Jacks arm
toward him then tears back the sleeve of Jacks shirt -

-- exposing a BRAND on Jacks inner wrist a large P
NORRINGTON (CONTD)

Had a brush-up with the East India

Trading Company did you pirate

The others react in shock but the sailors are well-trained
--in an instant half a dozen pistols are aimed at Jack He
stands there still holding the corset

NORRINGTON (CONTD)
Keep your guns on him men Gillette
fetch some irons

Norrington notices something else -- below the P brand is
a tattoo a small bird in flight across water

NORRINGTON (CONTD)
Well well Jack Sparrow isnt it

JACK
Captain Jack Sparrow If you please

Norrington looks out at the bay

NORRINGTON
I dont see your ship -- Captain

MURTOGG
He said hed come to commandeer one

MULLROY
(to Murtogg)
I told you he was telling the truth
(currying favor)
These are his sir

He holds out Jacks pistol and belt Norrington takes the
pistol examines it notes the powder horn on Jacks belt

NORRINGTON
(to Jack)
Extra powder but no additional shot

Jack shrugs Norrington unhooks the compass from the belt
opens it He frowns at the reading Moves the compass this
way and that keeping it parallel to the ground

NORRINGTON (CONTD)
It doesnt bear true

Jack looks away a bit embarrassed Norrington returns the
compass to the belt Draws the sword half from the
scabbard

NORRINGTON (CONTD)
I half-expected it to be made of wood

He slides it back into the scabbard hands it to Mullroy

NORRINGTON (CONTD)
Taking stock youve got a pistol with
only one shot a compass that doesnt
point north and no ship You are
without a doubt the worst pirate I have
ever heard of

JACK
Ah but you have heard of me

Gillette returns with shackles approaches Jack

NORRINGTON
Carefully lieutenant

Elizabeth steps forward Swanns jacket slips off her She
is unconcerned but he is intent on putting it back on her

ELIZABETH
Commodore I must protest Pirate or
not this man saved my life

NORRINGTON
One good deed is not enough to redeem a
man of a lifetime of wickedness

Gillette snaps the manacles closed on Jacks wrists

JACK
But it seems to be enough to condemn
him

NORRINGTON
(smiles)
Indeed

Now that Jack is safely chained Norrington nods to his
men All but one stow their weapons and two step forward -
JACK
Finally

Lightning-quick he snaps the corset around the hand and
wrist of the man holding the pistol and yanks The pistol
sails into the water Before anyone can react to that Jack
has the manacle chain wrapped around Elizabeths throat

Pistols are drawn again but now Elizabeth serves as a
shield Norrington raises a cautioning hand to his men

JACK (CONTD)
(backing away toward land)
Commodore Norrington my pistol and
belt please

Norrington hesitates balls his fists in frustration

JACK (CONTD)
Commodore

Mullroy hands the pistol and belt to Norrington Norrington
holds them out to Jack

JACK (CONTD)
Elizabeth -- it is Elizabeth

Elizabeth is more angry than frightened
ELIZABETH Miss Swann

JACK
Miss Swann if youll be so kind

She takes the belt and pistol from Norrington -- Jacks
quicker than she is and takes the pistol from her He
jerks her around so she is facing him belly to belly

JACK (CONTD)
Now if youll be very kind

She figures out what he wants put the belt on him

ELIZABETH
(as she works)
You are despicable

EXT PORT ROYAL - TOWN

ALLEY - DAY

The fog creeps through casting an eerie twilight pall An
armed search party moves along the street They glance down
an alley-

On the far side is another search party The men nod to
each other continue on

A moment and then Jack drops from his hiding place beneath
the eaves of a building He still wears the manacles

Across the street is a shop with barn doors a pass-thru
door set in the middle Above is a sign with a black anvil

INT BLACKSMITHS FORGE - DAY

Jack slips in through the door takes a look around
No windows The forge is dark lit
progress is scattered about wagon
gates pipes -- even a cannon with
tool is in place the workbench is

by lanterns Work-in-
wheels wrought iron

a crack in it But every
tidy and neat

Jack is startled by a noise MISTER BROWN ina
blacksmiths apron snores in the corner cradling a
bottle Jack gives him a hard poke Another Brown snorts
turns away

Satisfied Jack sheathes his sword takes a short-handled
sledge from its place on the wall Moves to the glowing
coke furnace in the middle of the room

Slowly he holds his right hand over the furnace the
chain down in the embers The chain begins to GLOW Jack
sweats grimaces at the pain -

Moving quickly
anvil brings t
the glowing lin

plunges his manacled hand in a bucket of water

billows

Jack pulls his
the manacle

he wraps the chain around the nose of an
he sledge down with a fast hard stroke on
s One SHATTERS Jack drops the sledge
Steam

hand out flexes it Blisters form beneath
but his hands are free

The SOUND of the latch on the door -- Jac

k dives for cover

Will enters the forge shuts the door behind him Spots the

drunken Mister Brown in the corner

WILL
Right where I left you

Something catches his eye an empty peg o
sledge lying beside the anvil

WILL (CONTD)
(under his breath)
Not where I left you

n the wall The

He moves casually toward the sledge Then grabs for it --
but the flat of a sword blade slaps his hand Will jumps

back

Jack stands there sword leveled at Will
toward the door Will glares at him

WILL (CONT D)
(voice low and tight)
Youre the one theyre hunting
The pirate

Jack acknowledges it with a tip of his he
frowns regards Will

JACK

He backs Will up

ad then

You look familiar Have I ever

threatened you before

WILL
Ive made a point of avoiding
familiarity with pirates

JACK
Ah Then it would be a shame to

put a black mark on your record

So if youll excuse me

Beside the door is a grindstone a sword
the honing guide Before Jack can react
in hand

JACK (CONTD)
Do you think this is wise boy
Crossing blades with a pirate

resting in
Will has it
WILL
You threatened Miss Swann

JACK
Only a little

In response Will assumes an en garde position Jack
appraises him unhappy to see Will knows what hes doing

Jack attacks The two men stand in one place trading
feints thrusts and parries with lightning speed almost
impossible to follow Will has no trouble matching Jack

JACK (CONTD)
You know what youre doing Ill
give you that Excellent form
But hows your footwork If I
step here -

He takes a step around an imaginary circle Will steps the
other way maintaining his relationship to Jack

JACK (CONTD)
Very good And if I step again
you step again

(continuing to step

around the circle)
And so we circle circle like
dogs we circle

They are now exactly opposite their initial positions

JACK (CONTD)
Ta

Jack turns and heads for the door now directly behind him

Will registers angry surprise -- and then with a vicious
overhand motion he throws his sword -

-- the sword buries itself into the door just above the
latch barely missing Jack Jack registers it then pulls

on the latch but it wont move up -- the sword is in the
way
Jack rattles the latch Tugs on the sword a few times -- it

is really stuck in there Jack mouths a curse but when he
turns back to Will hes smiling

JACK (CONT D)
Thats a good trick Except once
again you are between me and the
way out

(points his sword at the

back door)
And now you have no weapon

Eyes on Jack Will simply picks up a new sword from an
anvil Jack slumps in dismay -- but then leaps forward

Will and Jack duel Their blades flash and ring Suddenly
Jack swings the chain still manacled to his left hand at
Wills head Will ducks it comes up wide-eyed

Then Jacks chain smashes across Wills sword disarming
him

Will quickly picks up another sword Jack becomes aware
that the entire room is filled with bladed weapons swords
knives boarding axes in various stages of completion

JACK (CONTD)
Who makes all these

WILL
I do And I practice with them At
least three hours a day

JACK
You need to find yourself a girl
(Will sets his jaw)
Or maybe the reason you practice
three hours a day is youve found

one -- but cant get her
A direct hit -- and Will coils even more tightly with
anger
WILL
No I practice three hours a day
so that when I meet a pirate I

can kill him

He explodes kicks a rack causing a sword to fall into his
hand uses his foot to bring his dropped sword into the
air catches it -- and attacks Jack both blades flashing

Jack parries with sword and chain Jacks chain wraps
around Wills sword Will twists the handle of his guard
through a link and stabs the sword up into the ceiling -

So Jacks manacled left arm is now suspended from the
ceiling Not good He parries using one hand twisting and
dodging around the furnace -

Jack compresses the bellows blowing a SHOWER OF SPARKS
into Wills face Jack grabs the chain hoists himself up
kicks with his feet knocking Will back

Jack uses his full weight yanks the sword from the
ceiling Hurls a wooden mallet at Will then a second
hitting Will on the wrist Will drops his sword falls
down gets up —-

Jacks pistol is aimed directly between Wills eyes

Will steps back directly in front of the back exit
Glares rubs his wrist gingerly

WILL (CONTD)
You cheated

JACK

(smiles what do you expect)
Pirate

Jack steps forward Will steps back fully blocking the
door

JACK (CONTD)
Move away

WILL
No
JACK
Move
WILL

No I can not just step aside and
let you escape

Jack cocks the pistol Will stares back The stand-off
lasts for a long moment

JACK
Youre lucky boy -- this shots
not meant for you

Jack uncocks the pistol Will is surprised reassesses Jack

Suddenly Mister Brown SLAMS his bottle against Jacks
skull Jack crumples to the ground
The front and back doors smash open and SAILORS fill the
room Norrington pushes forward sees Jack on the ground

NORRINGTON
Excellent work Mister Brown
Youve aided in the capture of a
dangerous fugitive

BROWN
Just doing my civic duty

Jack groans Norrington stands over him smiles
NORRINGTON
I believe you will always remember
this as the day Captain Jack

Sparrow almost escaped

Norringtons men haul Jack away Will watches them go
Brown looks at his bottle -- broken

BROWN
That ratter broke my bottle

EXT PORT ROYAL - NIGHT

The thick fog blankets the entire bay now and the town
The only structure visible is Fort Charles high on the
bluff like a tall ship sailing a sea of grey

Above the Fort is a clear black sky sprinkled with stars A
waxing moon shines giving both Fort and fog an eerie glow

ANGLE - FORT CHARLES

just below the stone parapets of the fort visible briefly
deep in the fog like a shark fin slicing through the
water the TOPMAST of a ship BLACK SAILS billowing Flying
from the mast is a flag with white Aztec skull

The Black Pearl has come to Port Royal
INT GOVERNORS MANSION - ELIZABETHS BEDROOM - NIGHT

A maid removes a bed warmer from the fireplace slides it
between the sheets at the end of Elizabeths bed

ELIZABETH
Nice and toasty Thank you
Estrellia

The maid nods exits Elizabeth opens a book begins
reading toying absently with the medallion chain around
her neck

The lamp flame begins to diminish Elizabeth tries to turn
it up No good The flame goes out and the room is black

INT BLACKSMITHS FORGE - NIGHT

Will shirtless wearing a leather apron heats an iron
ingot at the furnace hammers it flat -- he stops

His attention is drawn to the window He opens the shutter
and peers out -- nothing but fog Almost without noticing

he reaches for a boarding axe hanging on the wall Takes it
down it has a satisfying weight in his hands

INT CELL BLOCK - NIGHT

CLOSE ON A mutt of a dog holding a ring of keys in his
mouth

Three seedy-looking prisoners try to coax the dog to their
cell door One holds a loop of rope another waggles a
bone The dog just sits and cocks its head

PRISONER
Come here boy Want a nice
juicy bone

In an adjoining cell Jack lies on a pile of straw

JACK
You can keep doing that forever
that dogs never going to move

PRISONER
Excuse us if we aint resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet

EXT FORT CHARLES - PARAPETS - NIGHT

A noose hangs from a gallows in the courtyard Norrington
and Swann walk along the far wall

SWANN
Has my daughter given you an
answer yet
NORRINGTON
No She hasnt

SWANN
Well she had a taxing day
Ghastly weather tonight

NORRINGTON
Bleak Very bleak

From the distance there is a BOOM -

SWANN
What was that

-- and then the WHISTLE of an incoming ball --

NORRINGTON
Cannon fire

He tackles Swann as the wall of the parapet EXPLODES --
INT CELL BLOCK - NIGHT
Jack sits up There are more BOOMS -

JACK
I know those guns

He peers out through the bars of the window The other
prisoners crowd around their window as well

JACK (CONTD)
Its the Black Pearl

PRISONER
(frightened)

The Black Pearl Ive heard
stories shes been preying on
ships and settlements for near ten
years and never leaves any
survivors

JACK

There are a lot of stories about
the Black Pearl

EXT PORT ROYAL - HARBOR - NIGHT
The Black Pearl still cannot be seen -- but the fog lights

up around her with each boom of her guns Shes firing on
both sides now hammering both the fort and the town
EXT PORT ROYAL - TOWN - NIGHT

Streets buildings docks and ships shatter and explode
beneath the onslaught Villagers panic run for cover
dodge flying debris as best they can If this is not hell
on earth then its about to be --

-- long boats emerge out of the fog carrying ARMED
PIRATES They swarm from the boats striking down
Villagers indiscriminately and setting fires

INT BLACKSMITHS FORGE - NIGHT

Will slips the boarding axe into his belt at the small of
his back He puts a dirk in his belt then a second anda
third He picks up a second axe and a sword

Will slides back the doors of the forge --
A woman runs past chased by a ONE-ARMED PIRATE wearing a

yellow bandeau Will backhands the axe square into his
chest a deadly blow Will heads out up the street --

EXT FORT CHARLES - PARAPETS - NIGHT

The moon is obscured by smoke rising from the burning
gallows and wooden roofs Cannon fire continues to rain
down but the forts own cannons now return fire

NORRINGTON
Governor Barricade yourself in my
office
(Swann hesitates)
Thats an order

Swann turns to go -- but finds himself face-to-face with a
pirate -- KOEHLER a handsome blond man with gold earrings
Beyond Koehler more pirates come up over the far wall
Koehler grins and raises a cutlass -
-- Norringtons sword blocks Koehlers slash
NORRINGTON (CONTD)

Theyve flanked us Men Swords

and pistols
The battle is joined --
INT GOVERNORS MANSION - ELIZABETH £ S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Elizabeth looks out a window at the scene below even
through the fog multiple fires are visible and ships burn
in the harbor Shouts and cries of pain Cannon fire
ECHOES

She notices movement directly below her window two SHADOWY
FIGURES approaching the house -- pirates Elizabeth bolts
from her room--

INT SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

She reaches the railing overlooking the foyer and cries
out just as the butler opens the door -- too late there
is the BOOM of a gun and the butler crumples

Elizabeth ducks down in horror peering through the
balusters The pirates scan the foyer searching The
leader is PINTEL a sallow-looking pirate with a bald head

Suddenly Pintel looks up and locks eyes with Elizabeth
How could he know she was there

PINTEL
Up there

The pirates rush for the stairs Elizabeth scrambles back
into the nearest room--

INT SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

Elizabeth shuts the door locks it listens as the pirates
pound up the stairs --

ESTRELLA
Miss Elizabeth

Elizabeth jumps Estrella is right behind her terrified
They whisper

ESTRELLA (CONTD)
Are they come to kidnap you miss
The daughter of the governor would
be very valuable

Elizabeth realizes shes right There is the SLAM of a body
against the door

ELIZABETH
Listen Estrella -- they havent
seen you Hide and first chance
run for the fort

Estrella nods Another SLAM at the door -- it gives a bit -
Elizabeth shoves Estrella into the corner between a tall
wardrobe and the wall Dashes for the side door

When the door smashes inward it slams into the wardrobe
and the maid cannot be seen The pirates run in -- spot the
open side door and run for it --

INT ELIZABETHS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Pintel is the first through and gets the pan of the bed
warmer in the face for his trouble -- he staggers back
holding his nose --

INT SITIING ROOM - NIGHT

Estrella breaks cover runs for the hall unnoticed

INT ELIZABETHS BEDROOM - NIGHT

-- Elizabeth swings the bed warmer at the second pirate

but he catches it by the handle -- Elizabeth cant jerk it
free so she wrenches it over -- the pan lid swings down
BANGING the second pirate -- hot coals spill on his head

sizzling
Elizabeth dashes for the hallway stairs -
INT SECOND FLOOR HALLWAYFOYER - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

The pirates burst from the bedroom -- Pintel goes for the
stairs but the second pirate vaults the handrail --

Estrella registers the butlers body but continues out the
still-open front door at a dead run Elizabeth follows --

The second pirate lands between Elizabeth and the front
door His face is BURNED his hair SMOLDERS -- he reaches -

Elizabeth pulls up short runs the other way --
Pintel on the stairs grabs her by the hair -- Elizabeth

doesnt slow -- she spins grabs Pintels arm with both
hands and pulls him hard belly-first into the cap of the
newel post -- he lets go of her hair -- Elizabeth keeps
going

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Elizabeth slams the double doors shut throws the bolts
The interior shutters are closed over the windows Above
the fireplace are two crossed swords

Elizabeth climbs on the firebox she grabs one of the
swords by the hilt and pulls -- but it wont come free
Both swords are securely attached to the wall Damn

A SMASH from the doors -- the pirates are relentless -

On the table is a platter with fruit cheese and bread
Elizabeth grabs the knife from the platter -

Like any bread knife it has a round point Elizabeth jabs
it into her palm -- its useless as a weapon Double damn

The blade of a boarding axe breaches the door -- the
pirates will be through soon -- Elizabeth looks around -

INT FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
The doors give way the pirates charge through -
INT DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Empty Elizabeth nowhere to be seen Pintel and Smoldering
Pirate search under the table behind draperies

PINTEL
We know youre here poppet Come
out and we promise we wont hurt
you

Smoldering pirate gives him look -- he wants to hurt her
plenty Pintel shakes his head Dont worry Im lying

PINTEL (CONTD)
We will find you poppet
Youve got something of ours and
it calls to us

INT DUMBWAITER - NIGHT

Elizabeth hides in the dumbwaiter box wrapped around the
double pulley ropes that go through the center

PINTEL (0S)
The gold calls to us

Elizabeth registers that -- she pulls out the medallion
rubs
the gold with her thumb This is their objective Light

spills into the- box through gaps in the top as the door
above is slid open -- Elizabeth looks up through the gaps -

Pintel leers down at her

PINTEL (CONTD)
Hello poppet

Elizabeth works the ropes to lower the box Pintel pulls
the other way hes stronger and the box rises Elizabeth
tries to stop it -- wraps her left forearm through the rope
and lets it jam against the top of the box

Elizabeth gasps at the pain but the box stops She saws at
the rope with the bread knife

Smoldering pirate helps pull the rope crushing Elizabeths
forearm Tears of pain on her face she keeps sawing -

The rope parts and the dumbwaiter box PLUMMETS -

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

From behind the door of the dumbwaiter comes a CRASH and a
cloud of dust The door slides open and Elizabeth clambers
out Her head is cut she is streaked with dirt and can
barely stand She leans over the table trying to recover

The sound of running FOOTSTEPS gets louder

ELIZABETH
Please no

Elizabeth touches the chain of the medallion anda
desperate idea occurs to her

The pirates burst through the door Elizabeth backs away
holds the bread knife out to ward them off They come
around either side of the table stalking her -

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
(gasps it out)
Par Parlay

Pintel cant believe his ears

PINTEL
What

ELIZABETH
Parlay I invoke the right of
parlay According to the Code of
the Brethren set down by the
pirates Morgan and Bartholomew
you must take me to your Captain

PINTEL
I know the code

ELIZABETH
If an adversary demands parley
you can do them no harm until the
parlay is complete

PINTEL
It would appear so do you

SMOLDERING PIRATE
To blazes with the code

He steps forward dirk drawn -- Pintel stops him

PINTEL
She wants to be taken to the
Captain and shell go without a
fuss

He looks to Elizabeth right Elizabeth nods

PINTEL (CONTD)
We must honor the code

Smoldering Pirate concedes the point sheaths his dirk He
grabs Elizabeth roughly by the arm -

EXT PORT ROYAL - STREET - NIGHT

Will races along momentarily free of the pirates He spots
the Governors Mansion in the distance There are FIGURES
moving away from it -- Elizabeth forced by the two
pirates

Will hurries forward -

Suddenly a PIRATE jumps out from the shadows slashes Will
defends himself The pirate has one arm and wears a yellow
bandana Will hesitates -- didnt he already kill this guy

The hesitation is just enough for another PIRATE swinging
a flaming torch to SLAM Will in the head from behind Will
crumples
The pirate lights a second torch hands it to One-arm they
hoot with delight and head off setting fires as they go

On the ground Will doesnt move
INT FORT CHARLES - CELL BLOCK - NIGHT

The wall of the cells EXPLODES inward Jack pulls himself
out from under rubble Moonlight spills in through the
gaping hole created by the cannon ball Beyond it freedom

But it is centered on the other cell The part of Jacks
cell that is gone is too small for a man to slip through

PRISIONER
Praise be

He and the other two scramble through

PRISONER (CONTD)
(back to Jack)
My sympathies friend - - youve
no manner of luck at all

The three descend the rocks beyond disappearing from view

Jack is alone Cannon fire continues occasional hits
shaking the fort The dog cowers under a long bench key
ring still in his mouth Jack sighs -- resigned he picks
up the bone from the other cell and tries coax the dog
forward

JACK
Its all right doggie come
here

boy Come here Spot Rover Fido

To his surprise the dog crawls out from under the bench
Jack continues to coax him closer

The key ring is nearly within Jacks reach -- suddenly the
dogs attention goes to the door into the cell block He
BRISTLES GROWLS He backs away from the door whining

JACK (CONTD)
Whats the matter boy

The dog bolts through the bars into the cell then out
through the breached wall -- taking the keys with him

The door to the cell block bursts open A pair of pirates
step in KOEHLER and TWIGG

TWIGG
This isnt the armory

He turns to go but Koehler has spotted Jack

KOEHLER
(Dutch accent)
Well well Look what we have
here Twigg Its Captain
Sparrow
TWIGG

Huh Last time I saw you you were
all alone on a God-forsaken
island shrinking into the
distance Id heard youd gotten
off but I didnt believe it

KOEHLER
Did you sprout little wings and
flyaway

TWIGG

His fortunes arent improved much

The two laugh Jack doesnt He steps forward close to the
bars This puts him in a spill of moonlight He is tight
with fury

JACK
Worry about your own fortunes The
lowest circle of hell is reserved
for betrayers and mutineers

Koehler and Twigg dont like hearing that Koehler lashes
out grabs Jack by the throat through the bars Jack

clutches the pirates wrist looks down -

Where they enter the moonlight Koehlers wrists and hands
are skeletal

Jacks eyes go wide -- he is holding a skeleton arm

JACK (CONT D)
You are cursed

Koehler sneers shoves Jack backwards hard Now out of the
moonlight his hand is normal Jack stares realizing -

JACK (CONTD)
The stories are true
Koehler ushers Twigg toward the door Looks back

KOEHLER
You know nothing of hell

And then theyre gone

EXT PORT ROYAL - NIGHT

Amid the thunder of cannon fire a longboat slips through
the fog Elizabeth sits in the prow Columns of water from
cannon balls geyser up around the boat

The fog parts Elizabeth looks up to see --

The Black Pearl a tall galleon its black sails looming
high above her At the bow is an ornately carved figurehead
of a beautiful woman arm held high a small bird taking

wing from her outstretched hand

The longboat makes for a pair of lines dangling froma
winch

EXT BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - NIGHT

Lit by lanterns no moon is visible beneath the fog Smoke
hangs heavy above the deck

Elizabeths longboat is raised above the deck rail --
pirates spot her and stare One polite fellow steps

forward to offer his hand She takes it and steps down She
huddles self-conscious in her nightgown and dressing robe

BOSUN
I didnt know we was taking
captives
PINTEL
Shes invoked the right of
parlay with Captain Barbossa
ON THE POOP DECK -- an imposing FIGURE in silhouette stands

by the wheel too far away to have heard Pintels words
But his head turns at the mention of his name

The silhouetted figure moves toward the stairs A cloud of
SMOKE obscures him -- and then as if he skipped the
stairs he strides out of the SMOKE on the main deck-
This is BARBOSSA Despite the bright colors of clothing
definitely not a man youd want to meet in a dark alley --
or anywhere for that matter

Elizabeth more terrified than ever cannot look away from
his eyes But she musters her courage -

ELIZABETH
I am here to --

The Bosun SLAPS her

BOSUN
Youll speak when spoken to

His wrist is grabbed -- painfully -- by Barbossa

BARBOSSA
And youll not lay a hand on those
under the protection of parlay

BOSUN
Aye sir

Barbossa releases him Turns to Elizabeth smiles -- it
shows both silver and gold teeth

BARBOSSA

My apologies miss As you were
saying before you were so rudely
interrupted

ELIZABETH
Captain Barbossa I have come
to negotiate the cessation of
hostilities against Port Royal

Barbossa is both impressed and amused

BARBOSSA
There was a lot of long words in
there miss and were not but
humble pirates What is it you
want

ELIZABETH
I want you to leave And never
come back

Barbossa and the pirates laugh
BARBOSSA
I am disinclined to acquiesce to
your request
(helpfully)
Means No

ELIZABETH
Very well

She quickly slips the medallion off darts to the side
rail dangles it over the side of the ship The pirates go
quiet

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Ill drop it

BARBOSSA
My holds are bursting with swag
That bit of shine matters to me
Why

ELIZABETH
Because its what youre searching
for Youve been searching for it
for years I recognize this ship

I saw it eight years ago when we
made the crossing from England

BARBOSSA
(interested)
Did you now

Elizabeth glares at him Shes getting nowhere

ELIZABETH
Fine I suppose if this is
worthless theres no reason to
keep it

She flips the medallion up off her finger -

BARBOSSA
NO

She catches it by the chain smiles at him triumphantly

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
You have a name missy

ELIZABETH
Elizabeth -
(stops herself from

saying Swann then)
Turner

(embroidering)
Im a maid in the governors
household

(curtsies)
Barbossa reacts to the name
Turner it confirms what he has
suspected The other pirates
surreptitiously exchange glances
and nods

BARBOSSA
Youve got sand for a maid

ELIZABETH
(curtsies again)
Thank you sir

BARBOSSA

And how does a maid come to own a
trinket such as that A family
heirloom perhaps

ELIZABETH
Of course
(offended)
I didnt steal it if thats what
you mean

BARBOSSA
No no nothing like that
(comes to a decision)
Very well You hand that over
well put your town to our rudder
and neer return

ELIZABETH
Can I trust you

BARBOSSA
Its you who invoked the parlay
Believe me Miss youd best hand
it over now or these be the
last friendly words youll hear

Elizabeth hesitates but she has no choice She holds out
the medallion He grabs it clutches it in his fist like
hope
ELIZABETH

Our bargain
Barbossa grins devilishly -- but then nods to the Bosun
BOSUN

Still the guns and stow em
Signal the men set the flags and
make good to clear port

For the first time since the attack began the BOOMING of
the guns ceases Elizabeth is surprised -- and relieved
The pirates hustle to follow orders Barbossa turns away

ELIZABETH
Wait You must return me to shore
According to the rules of the
Order of the Brethren -

Barbossa wheels on her

BARBOSSA
First Your return to shore was
not part of our negotiations nor
our agreement and so I must do
nothing Secondly you must be a
pirate for the pirates code to
apply And youre not And
thirdly

the code is more what youd call guidelines than actual
rules

(grins gold and silver)

Welcome aboard the Black Pearl Miss Turner
Elizabeth stares in speechless terror -

EXT PORT ROYAL - HARBOR - PRE-DAWN

As the Black Pearl turns out to sea Elizabeth is led back
along the deck to the captains cabin

The fog starts to dissipate turning to a light mist
through it the Black Pearl makes for the scarlet glow of
dawn

EXT PORT ROYAL - STREET - PRE-DAWN

Will comes to still where he fell gets to his feet
He takes in the devastation of Port Royal the harbor is
dotted with burning and sunken ships buildings are razed
and still smolder The aftermath of hell on earth

Will turns and runs for the Governors Mansion
INT GOVERNORS MANSION - MORNING

Will races past the smashed doors into the foyer Calls
out

WILL
Miss Swann Elizabeth

A terrible silence answers him He spots an overturned
chair fallen bookshelf -

INT FORT CHARLES - NORRINGTONS OFFICE - MORNING
Will bursts in still armed with sword and boarding axe

WILL
Theyve taken her Theyve taken
Elizabeth

A group stares at him Swann Norrington and Gillette
among others gathered around a map The map is so large it
drapes over the Governors desk the far end supported by a
chair

NORRINGTON
Were aware of the situation

WILL
We have to hunt them down -- and
save her

Swanns worry has made him short-tempered

SWANN
Where do you propose we start If
you have any information that
concerns my daughter then share
it If anyone does tell me
(Will is silent)
Leave Mr Turner

Murtogg has remembered something He ventures it warily
MURTOGG

That Jack Sparrow he talked
about the Black Pearl
MULLROY
Mentioned it is more what he did

MURTOGG
Still --

WILL
We can ask him where it is --
maybe he can lead us to it

SWANN

That pirate tried to kill my
daughter We could never trust a
word he said

WILL
We could strike a bargain -

NORRINGTON

No The pirates who invaded this
fort left Sparrow locked in his
cell Ergo he is not their ally
and therefore of no value

(through with Will)
We will determine their most
likely course and launch a search
mission that sails with the tide

Will slams the boarding axe into the desk through the map

WILL
Thats not good enough This is
Elizabeths life

Norrington is quick to react he throws a strong arm across
Wills back and guides him roughly to the door

NORRINGTON

Mr Turner this is not the time
for rash actions

(low)
Do not make the mistake of
thinking you are the only man here
who loves Elizabeth

(firm)
Now go home

He opens the door and then turns away Will watches him
walk back to the desk Wills face sets in resolve and he
leaves
INT FORT CHARLES - JAIL CELLS - MORNING

Jack strains trying to budge one of the bars Even with
the damage from the cannon ball it wont move He hears
the sound of the door latch -

The door opens and Will slips in Looks around Jack
lounges on the floor of his cell apparently relaxed and
unconcerned Will marches straight up to the bars

WILL
Are you familiar with that ship
The Black Pearl

JACK
Somewhat

WILL
Where does it make berth

JACK
Surely youve heard the stories The
Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla
de Mureta an island that cannot be
found -- except by those who already
know where it is

WILL
The ships real enough So its
anchorage must be a real place Where
is it

JACK
Why ask me

WILL
Because youre a pirate

JACK
And you want to turn pirate
yourself

WILL
Never
(beat)
They took Miss Swann

JACK
(he was right)
So it is that you found a girl Well
if youre intending to brave all and
hasten to her rescue and so win fair
ladys heart youll have to do it
alone I see no profit in it for me

Will slams his fist against the bars in frustration Jack
is surprised at the outburst Will thinks makes a
decision

WILL
I can get you out of here

JACK
How The keys run off

WILL
(examines the cell)
I helped build these cells Those are
hook-and-ring hinges The proper
application of strength the doorll
lift free Just calls for the right
lever and fulcrum

Jack watches Will as he speaks and it dawns on him -- Will
is the spitting image of someone hes known in the past

JACK
Your name is Turner

Will gives him a puzzled look

WILL
Yes Will Turner

Jack grins

JACK

Will Turner

(he stands)
Ill tell you what Mr Turner Ive
changed my mind You spring me from
this cell and on pain of death Ill
you to the Black Pearl

(sticks out his hand)
Do we have an accord

Will gives him a suspicious look The deal seems too good
Jack keeps his hand out still smiling Will shakes it

WILL
Agreed

JACK
Agreed

Will looks around figures out what he needs He makes a
chair his fulcrum and levers the long bench under the
door Pushes down -- its hard work -- but the cell door
rises and then falls forward CRASHING down on the bench
and chair

Jack is impressed He steps out of the cell

WILL
Someone will have heard that
Hurry

Will heads for the door Jack searches the desk cupboards

JACK
Not without my effects

WILL
We need to go

Jack finds his pistol sword belt and compass Straps on
the belt checks the shot in his pistol

WILL (CONTD)
Why are you bothering with that

JACK
My business Will As for your business
-one question or theres no use going
(joins Will at the door)

This girl -- what does she mean to you
How far are you willing to go to save
her

WILL

(no hesitation)
Id die for her

JACK
Good

The Jolly Mon four inches of water in the bottom squats
low in the water heeled to one side creaking on its
lines

Jack hops down into the boat Prepares to make way

JACK (CONTD)

I knew the Harbormaster wouldnt report

her Honest men are slaves

Jack notices that Will is standing frozen on the dock

exploded
(regards the boat)
Its been a sound policy

JACK

No worries there Shes far more
likely to rot out from under us

Will steels himself steps into the boat as if its going to

capsize with the slightest movement

JACK (CONTD)

Jack hoists the sail

Besides we are about to better

our prospects considerably

He nods toward the HMS Dauntless
Will whiteknuckles the gunwales

WILL

looming in the harbor

Were going to steal a ship That

ship

JACK
Commandeer Were going to

commandeer a ship Nautical term

WILL
Its still against the law

JACK

Sos breaking a man out of

jail Face

it Will you may say youll never be a
pirate but youre off to a rip-roaring
start
(smiling)
My advice -- smile and enjoy it

EXT PORT ROYAL - MORNING

The Jolly Mon bobs its way across the bay dwarfed against
the HMS Dauntless Will holds a stay line with iron
fists

WILL
This is either crazy or
brilliant

JACK
Remarkable how often those two
traits coincide
The Jolly Man nears the rudder of the much larger ship -

EXT H M S DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - MORNING

Theres been a breakdown in discipline about a dozen Navy
sailors are gathered together on the main deck playing
dice Murtogg and Mullroy among them

Suddenly Jack and Will jump out into the open -
brandishing pistols
JACK
Everybody stay calm Were taking
over the ship
WILL
(a beat)
Aye Avast

Jack gives him a look shakes his head dont do that

The sailors all look at them -- and then burst out
LAUGHING They grin shake their heads Jack stands there
grinning with them -- but his gun is still level The
Lieutenant GILLETTE steps forward

GILLETTE

Youre serious about this
Jack moves his pistol across points it at Gillette

JACK
Dead serious

GILLETTE
You understand this ship cannot be
crewed by only two men Youll never
make it out of the bay

JACK
Well see about that

More guffaws from the crew A couple sailors move forward
hands on swords -- Gillette holds up a hand

GILLETTE
Sir Ill not see any of my men killed
or wounded in this foolish enterprise

JACK
Fine by me We brought you a nice
little boat so you can all get back to
shore safe and sound

GILLETTE
(a curt nod)
Agreed You have the momentary
advantage sir But I will see you
smile from the yard arm sir

JACK
As likely as not
(calling)
Will short up the anchor weve
got ourselves a ship

EXT DAUNTLESS - STERN - MORNING

Sailors make their way down a rope ladder crowd onto the
Jolly Mon Will pushes hard against the windlass to no
avail the anchor is too heavy for one man Jack
notices

JACK
A little help

Gillette shrugs gestures to Murtogg and Mullroy The three
men throw their weight into the windlass and it turns

Jacks pistol is on them the whole time

MURTOGG
I cant believe hes doing this

The windless turns bringing Mullroy into view
MULLROY
You didnt believe he was telling the
truth either

The windless turns some more and theres Gillette

GILLETTE
(over his shoulder to Will)
Do you have any idea boy what youre
doing

Another quarter turn -

WILL
No

EXT DAUNTLESS - FORECASTLE - DAY

Jack and Will crank a capstan raising the forward jib
sail It luffs and billows out The huge ship inches
forward slowly pulled by just the one sail Jack grins

JACK
Lookee there mate Were
underway

EXT PORT ROYAL - DOCK - DAY

Norrington moves along concentrating on a manifest
Alongside him is governor Swann who glances over -

Sees the tiny Jolly Mon headed toward them riding low in
the water overloaded with sailors Beyond that the

Dauntless sails -- albeit slowly -- for open waters
SWANN
Commodore --
NORRINGTON

A moment

SWANN
But --

NORRINGTON
Please

SWANN

Dammit man it appears someone is
stealing your ship
Norrington glances out at the bay Sure enough the
Dauntless is on the move Norrington takes a brass
telescope from his belt opens it trains it on --

The main deck He picks out Will -

NORRINGTON
Rash Turner too rash

-- then spots Jack at the wheel Lowers the telescope

NORRINGTON (CONTD)
That is without doubt the worst
pirate I have ever seen

EXT H M S DAUNTLESS - DAY

Out in the open sea Jack leans on the wheel relaxed not
much sailing to do with a following wind Will looks back -

WILL
Theyre coming

He points the sails of the Interceptor fill out and the
ship cuts through the water toward them-

EXT HMS INTERCEPTOR - DAY
Norringtons smaller ship quickly comes alongside the
slowmoving Dauntless Its decks appear empty Grappling
hooks are thrown and sailors draw the two ships together
Norringtons men swarm across
NORRINGTON
Search every cabin every hold

down to the bilges

PULL BACK away from the Dauntless and past the railing of

the Interceptor where a single SENTRY stands watch -- and
we find a soaked Jack and Will as they climb up over the
side of the smaller ship unseen

Jack tackles the Sentry from behind covers hilrmouth

JACK
Can you swim
(the man struggles)
Can You Swim

Jack removes his hand
SENTRY
Of course sir Like a fish I
grew up summers living in Dover
with my uncle -

JACK
Good

Jack lifts the man up throws him overboard Quickly unties
the ropes to the grappling hooks Will cranks the capstan
bars raising the foresail -

EXT H M S DAUNTLESS - DAY

Norrington emerges from a gangway -- and sees his other
ship moving away

NORRINGTON
Sailors Back to the Interceptor

But the distance is already too great One brave sailor
tries to swing across on a rope Errol-Flynn style but
falls short with a splash

Jack waves and shouts across the distance -

JACK
Thank you Commodore for getting our
ship ready to make way Wedve had a
hard time of it by ourselves

Norrington seethes but his order to Gillette is measured

NORRINGTON
Raise the sails

GILLETTE
The wind is quarter from astern
by the time were underway
well never catch them

NORRINGTON
We need only to come about to put
them in range of the long nines

Gillette looks surprised at the order -- but relays it
GILLETTE
Hands Come about Jackets off the
cannons

(to Norrington)
We are to fire on our own ship
NORRINGTON
Better to see it at the bottom of the
sea than in the hands of a pirate

The STEERSMAN turns the wheel The Dauntless course does
not change one whit

STEERSMAN
Captain theres a problem

The Steersman spins the wheel It goes round and round
with no signs of slowing

STEERSMAN (CONTD)
Hes disabled the rudder chain sir

NORRINGTON
So it would seem

The Interceptor dwindles with distance Gillette watches it
go with some degree of admiration

GILLETTE
Hes got to be the best pirate
Ive ever seen

Norrington reaches out stops the spinning ships wheel

NORRINGTON
So it would seem

The Interceptor makes for the horizon line A SLOW DISSOLVE
and with the time passage the ship is gone the sky turns
a deep twilight blue -

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - EVENING

-- with the fat white moon riding just above the horizon
Suddenly the edge of a black sail cuts into the
foreground accompanied by the ROAR of the wind and the
SNAP of canvas -

INT BLACK PEARL - CAPTAINS CABIN - EVENING

Elizabeth stalks the cabin Pintel enters carrying a black
silk dress

PINTEL
Youll be dining with the Captain
and he requests you wear this
ELIZABETH
Tell the captain that I am disinclined
to acquiesce to his request

PINTEL

(happy)
He said you say that He also said if
that be the case youll be dining with
the crew and youll be naked

Angry Elizabeth holds out her hand Pintels grin fades

PINTEL (CONTD)
(hands it over)
Fine

He exits pouting Elizabeth examines the dress -
INT BLACK PEARL - CAPTAINS CABIN - NIGHT

Barbossa enters followed by PIRATES carrying trays of
food wine table setting etc Elizabeth stands at the
small table in the dress -- lovely

BARBOSSA
Maid or not it fits you

ELIZABETH

Dare I ask the fate of its previous
owner

BARBOSSA
Now none of that Please dig in

The table is set Elizabeth sits cuts a tiny piece of
meat eats it daintily

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
No need to stand on ceremony and no
call to impress anyone You must be
hungry

Elizabeth drops the pretense shes starving and begins to
eat like it Barbossa watches her intently

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
Try the wine

Elizabeth does a huge swig she tears off a hunk of bread
devours it
BARBOSSA (CONTD)

And the apples -- one of those next
She starts to bite into the apple -- stops She is suddenly
aware of Barbossas gaze -- and that he is not eating
ELIZABETH

Its poisoned

She shoves her plate away -- and takes the opportunity to
palm her knife Barbossa LAUGHS

BARBOSSA
Oh there would be no sense in killing
you Miss Turner

ELIZABETH
Then why arent you eating

BARBOSSA
Would that I could

He produces the medallion lets it dangle from his fingers
BARBOSSA (CONTD)

Do you not know what this is
then

ELIZABETH
Its a pirate medallion

BARBOSSA
Its a piece of the treasure of Isla de
Muerta

Elizabeth gives an infinitesimal shrug intrigued despite
herself

BARBOSSA (CONT D)

Ah so you dont know as much as you
pretend Back when Cortes was cutting a
great bloody swath through the New
World a high priest gave him all the
gold they had with one condition that
he spare the peoples lives Of course
Cortes being Cortes he didnt

(nods)
Hedve made a great pirate that one

Barbossa stands moves to a shelf Puts a key to a medium-
sized polished wooden box -- the Captains chest Opens it
BARBOSSA (CONTD)
So the priest with his dying breath
called on the power of the blood of his
people and put on the gold a curse If
anyone took so much as a single piece
as he was compelled by greed by greed
he would be consumed

Inside the chest are charts some gold a sextant -- anda

few pages of a Mayan CODEX pieces of tree bark inscribed
with Mayan glyphs Barbossa removes them carefully sets
them on the table Pours over them

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
Within a day of leaving port for Spain
the treasure ship carrying the gold
something went wrong The ship run
aground every man aboard dead save
one He survived long enough to hide
the gold ashore

(beat)
Over time the dark magic of the curse
seeped into the place making it a
cursed island An island of death Isla
de Muerta

He looks up Elizabeth has been rapt involved in the story
-but feigns a dismissive attitude

ELIZABETH
Thats all very interesting but I
hardly believe in ghost stories
any more

Barbossa is angry He stands sweeps the food off the
table

BARBOSSA
You idiot girl Its no make-
believe My crew and I we found
the gold and we did more than
take one piece we took it all
Rich men we were and we spent it
and traded it and gave it away in
exchange

for drink and food and pleasant company But we found out
the drink could not sate us and the food turned to ashes
in our mouths and no amount of pleasant company could ease
our torment
(regains his composure)
We are cursed men Miss Turner

condemned to be forever consumed by our own greed Gold
calls to UB always and we are driven always to find
more and add it to the treasure

Barbossa picks up the priceless Codex Crushes them in his
fist

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
There is but one way to remove the
curse All of the scattered pieces
of the treasure must be restored
in full and the blood repaid

(he throws the pages

aside)

Weve recovered every piece --
save for this

(holds up the medallion)
And as for the blood thats
what we have you for

(pleasant finally

getting to his point)

And thats why theres no sense in
killing you Yet

Elizabeth stares at him horrified Using the toe of his
boot Barbossa flips an apple up off the floor catches it
extends it to Elizabeth

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
Apple

Elizabeth slowly reaches for the apple -- and then comes up
out of her chair trying to run around Barbossa They
struggle briefly and then suddenly he shoves her away-

Elizabeths stolen KNIFE is buried in Barbossas chest to
the hilt --

Barbossa is completely unaffected He opens his shirt to
get a better look at the knife pulls it out with little
effort There is BLOOD on the blade but none anywhere
else

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
Im curious -- after killing me
what is it you were planning to do
next

Elizabeth backs away whirls and barrels out the door -
EXT BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - NIGHT

-- Elizabeth comes to dead stop She stares her jaw
working trying to scream but unable to -

The pirate crew works at their stations coiling lines
navigating the ship swabbing decks -- but where the
moonlight falls across their bodies they are nauqht but
SKELETONS

Elizabeth turns away from the sight -

Barbossa stands just inside the doorway out of the
moonlight He grabs her roughly by the shoulders and jerks
her back around -- Elizabeth shuts her eyes -

BARBOSSA
Look
(shakes her)
LOOK The moonlight shows us for
what we really are We are not
among the living and so we cannot
die -

He spins her back around to face him -- he leans forward
putting his face in the moonlight turning it into a
gleaming SKULL with gold and silver teeth -

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
-- but neither are we dead We
have all the desires of the
living but cannot satisfy them
Ten years I have been parched of
thirst and unable to quench it
Ten years I have been starving to
death -- and havent died

(raises his hand)

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
And I have not felt anything for
ten years Not the wind on my
face nor the spray of the sea
(reaches toward
Elizabeth)
nor the flesh of a woman

Elizabeth flinches away from the skeletal hand It drops
away -- he takes a bottle of wine from the opened case
beside the cabin door uncorks it with his teeth raises it

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
Youd best start believing in
ghost stories Miss Turner
Because now youre in one

He tilts the bottle and drinks -- it runs over his jaw
through his rib cage drenching his clothes

Elizabeth darts around him back into the cabin and shuts
the door Barbossa hurls the bottle away

INT BLACK PEARL - CAPTAINS CABIN - NIGHT

Elizabeth huddles in the far corner of the cabin
terrified

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

The Interceptor cuts across the waves Jack at the wheel
Will tightens a line moves back astern

EXT INTERCEPTOR - MAIN DECK - DAY

Will sharpens his sword with a whetstone shhhk -- shhhk

JACK
For a man whose made an industry
of avoiding boats youre a quick
study

WILL
I worked passage from England as a
cabin boy
(an attempt at guile)
After my mother passed I came out
here looking for my father

JACK
Is that so

WILL
My father William Turner

Jack says nothing Will has lost the patience for guile

WILL ( CONT D)
Im not a simpleton At the jail -
- it was only after you learned my
name that you agreed to help

(a smile)
Since thats what I wanted I
didnt press the matter But now -

an accusation
You knew my father
Jack considers his reply -- settles on truth

JACK
I knew him Probably one of the
few who knew him as William
Turner Most everyone just called
him Bill or Bootstrap Bill

WILL
Bootstrap

JACK
Good man Good pirate And clever
-- I never met anyone with as
clever a mind and hands as him
When you were puzzling out that
cell door it was like seeing his
twin

WILL

(angry)
Thats not true

JACK
I swear you look just like him

WILL
Its not true that my father was a
pirate

JACK
Figured you wouldnt want to hear
it

WILL

He was a merchant marine He was a
respectable man who obeyed the
law and followed the rules--

JACK
(laughs)
You think your father is the only
man who ever lived the Glasgow
life telling folk one thing and
then going off to do another
Theres quite a few who come here
hoping to amass enough swag to
ease the burdens of respectable

life And theyre all ‘merchant

marines
WILL
My father did not think of my
mother -his family -- as a burden
JACK
Sure -- because he could always go
pirating
WILL
My father -- was not -- a pirate

Wills sword is out levelled at Jack Jack gives him a
disbelieving look sighs

JACK
Put it away Will Its not worth
getting beat again

WILL
You didnt beat me You ignored
the rules of engagement In a fair
fight Id kill you

JACK
Then thats not much incentive for
me to fight fair is it

He kicks a lever on a wench The sail boom whips around and
slams Will in the chest -- sweeping him off the ship His
sword clatters onto the deck Will dangles above the water

Jack slips a loop of rope around the wheel to hold the
course Picks up the sword -- and pokes at Will with it
Will hand-over-hands away from the blade to the end of the
boom

JACK ( CONT D)
As long as youre just hanging
there pay attention Must
Should do dont shall shall
not -- those are just suggestions
There are only two absolute rules
(ticks them off on his
fingers)

JACK (CONTD)
What a man can do And what a man
can I t do

Will looks away not interested

JACK (CONTD)

For instance you can accept that
your father was a pirate and still
a good man or you cant Now
me I can sail this ship to
Tortuga by myself

(Will looks alarmed)
But I cant just let you drown

Jack swings the boom back in Will drops to the deck Jack
holds the hilt of the sword out Will takes it Glares at
Jack considers what hell do next Jack watches him
coolly

Will turns and strides to his spot on the deck sits down
and resumes sharpening his sword shhhk -- shhhk -- shhhk

Jack breathes silent sigh of relief Notices his hand is
shaking -- he takes the wheel

WILL
Tortuga

JACK
Oh -- did I forget to mention
that

EXT TORTUGA - DAY

A dank and dirty port where the tides seem to have swept
together the scum of the Caribbean -- pirates privateers
prostitutes thieves and drunkards

With its cantered rotting docks weatherbeaten buildings
and odd assortment of livestock running free -- a donkey

chickens etc -- it is far less civilized than Port Royal

Jack and Will move through the crowd A REDHEADED woman
turns her head -- she has noticed Jack

JACK
We need a crew We can manage the
ship between islands but the open
sea thats another matter -

Suddenly the Redhead SLAPS Jack hard Satisfied she turns
and strides off Will ignores her

WILL
Just do it quickly

JACK
(rubbing his jaw)
Dont worry Ive already got my
Quartermaster -- there

Jack leads Will toward a pub the Faithful Bride the
emblem over the door a politically incorrect painting of a
smiling woman holding a bouquet in her chained-and-manacled
hands

Jack pulls open the door Will goes inside passing a pretty
ASIAN women coming out -- she sees Jack and immediately
SLAPS him cursing something in Chinese Jack backs away -

INT THE FAITHFUL BRIDE - DAY

Jack closes the door on the woman joins Will They take in
the place -- it is populated with a slightly higher class
of scum Jack spots a BARTENDER smiles moves forward -

--and is suddenly DECKED by a waitress This is ANAMARIA
tall strong tough she didnt spill a drink off her tray

ANAMARTA
You stole my boat

JACK
AnaMaria Have you seen Gibbs I
need to put together -

She SLAPS him again Will shakes his head heads for the
bar Jack gets up

JACK (CONTD)
Borrowed Borrowed your boat
(off her look)
Without permission

AnaMaria charges Jack backs away puts a table between
them She chases him around the table still carrying the
tray
ANAMARIA
My dory The Jolly Mon Where is

it

JACK
Safe At Port Royal With the
Royal Navy

ANAMARIA

That boat is my livelihood

JACK
Youll get it back Or one better

ANAMARTA
(a threat)
I will

Away from them a PATRON calls for his food AnaMaria
scowls at Jack moves away -- comes back for one more
SLAP

WILL
Jack Over here

AT THE BAR Will has spoken to the Bartender Jack arrives
rubbing his chin

WILL (CONTD)
He knows Gibbs

The Bartender nods yes Then nods out back Then
produces a water bucket from behind the bar

Jack and Will exchange a look-and Jack takes the bucket
EXT THE FAITHFUL BRIDE - REAR - DAY

A drunken man lays in the mud having a friendly
conversation with two pigs He wears an old tattered Navy
jacket

A sudden SPRAY OF WATER splashes across his face
revealing this is old JOSHAMEE GIBBS (the man who told

pirate stories to Elizabeth when she was a child) He
sputters and roars

GIBBS

Curse you for breathing you
slack-jawed idiot
(recognizes Jack)

Mothers love Jack you know
better than to wake a man when
hes sleeping Its bad luck

JACK
Well fortunately I know how to
counter it The man who did the waking
buys the man who was sleeping a drink
and the man who was sleeping it drinks
it while listening to a proposition

GIBBS
Aye thatll about do it

Jack helps Gibbs to his feet -- and then Gibbs is hit with
a second wave of water Will stands there with the bucket

GIBBS (CONTD)
Blast it Im already awake

WILL
I know That was for the smell

INT THE FAITHFUL BRIDE - DAY

Jack and Gibbs sit at a table in the shadows a single
candle illumining them speaking in hushed voices Will is
away from them at the door hand on sword keeping a look-
out

A tankard is set down Gibbs lifts it to take a swig -

JACK
Just the one

Gibbs pauses He takes a dainty sip

GIBBS
Make it ast then Now whats the
nature of this venture of yours

JACK
First -- have you found me a crew

GIBBS
Oh theres a hard tale Jack
Most of the decent pirates in town
wont sail with you -- seem to
think youre a jinx

JACK
Now where I wonder would they
have gotten that idea

Gibbs evades answering by taking a long sip Jack leans
forward Gibbs leans forward

JACK (CONTD)
Im going after the Black Pearl

Gibbs straightens up like hes been hit He stares He
reaches for the drink as if to down it -- but then sets it
back down He leans forwards again Jack has not moved

GIBBS
Say again

JACK
Ilm going after the Black Pearl I
know where its going to be and
Im going to take it

GIBBS
Jack its a fools errand Youve
heard the tales they tell about
the Pearl

JACK
Aye and thats why I know where its
going to be and thats why I know what
Barbossa is up to All I need is a
crew

GIBBS
(shakes his head)
A fools errand

JACK

Not if the fool has something
Barbossa wants Something he
needs

GIBBS
And youve got that have you

ANGLE ON Jack as he smiles enigmatically and shifts his
eyes -- behind him Will still on guard glares a sailor
away from the table

JACK
Back there guarding the door is
the son of old Bootstrap Bill
Turner

Gibbs eyes widen over the edge of the tankard Peers at
Will Then smiles with more missing teeth than good ones

GIBBS
Well lookee there Ill allow you
may be onto something Jack
(considers nods)
Theres bound to be sailors on
this rock crazy as you Ill find
some men

Gibbs downs the drink SLAMS the tankard on the table

Will reacts to the sound draws both sword and dagger
kicks over a table for cover and whirls on anyone who
moves

GIBBS (CONTD)
Kids a bit of a stick isnt he

JACK
That he is

EXT TORTUGA - DOCK - LATER - DAY

On the docks a disheveled motley and weatherbeaten group
of about a dozen swabs stand in a ragged line-up

GIBBS
Feast your eyes Capn All of em
good sea-faring men faithful hands
before the mast every one worth his
salt --

(sotto making his point)
-- and crazy to boot

Jack holds up a hand -- enough He moves down the line
Gibbs at his side Then he notices AnaMaria in line
dressed like a man He raises an eyebrow

ANAMARTA
You owe me a boat

Jack nods continues One sailor is quite fat another
thin and sickly Jack is not happy with his choices

He stops in front of COTTON a short sailor with a large
colorful PARROT on his shoulder Jack raises an eyebrow
GIBBS
Cotton here is mute sir Poor
devil had his tongue cut out --

Cotton opens his mouth to show this -- Jack grimaces

GIBBS (CONTD)
-- so he went and trained the parrot to
do the talking for him nobody knows
how Nobody knows the parrots name
neither so we just call it Cottons
parrot

Jack decides to test this

JACK
Mr Cotton Do you have the courage
and fortitude to follow orders and stay
true in the face danger and almost
certain death

Cotton lifts the parrot off his shoulder raises it --

COTTONS PARROT
Wind in your SAILS Wind in your SAILS

GIBBS
Mostly that seem to mean yes

Cotton nods vigorously lowers the parrot and it goes
silent Jack shakes his head Steps back

JACK

That goes for the rest of you
Danger and near certain death

(turns away)
For we are to sail for the Isla de
Muerta to rescue the daughter of
Governor Swann An equal share of the
reward shall be -

Jack hears movement looks back -- several potential crew
members back away in fright first one then another turn
and run followed by more

Soon just a half dozen are left including Cotton (with
parrot) -- and AnaMaria

WILL
Shut up before you lose them all
JACK
These are the only ones worth
having
(glances at the sky)
And were going to need them-

EXT H M S INTERCEPTOR - DAY

A FLASH of lightening and the CRACK of thunder The canvas
of every sail is stretched taut The ship rocks as it drops
into the valley of huge swell climbs up the other side

On board the new crew members scurry about their tasks
pulling lines and trimming sails Excellent sailors it
takes everything they have to keep the ship afloat

AnaMaria is at the helm Gibbs staggers along the deck

GIBBS
That fool will have us lose the
canvas and the masts besides

On Jack a ROARING wind blowing back his hair eyes intent
on their course Gibbs climbs the tilted deck toward him

GIBBS (CONTD)
Werd best drop canvas sirl

JACK
She can hold a bit longer

The wind picks up howling Jack smiles

GIBBS
(shouts)
Whats in your head to put you in such
a fine mood

JACK
(shouts)
Were catching up

Jack turns back to the sea enjoying himself Gibbs stares
at him like hes a crazy man

INT BLACK PEARL - CAPTAINS CABIN - DAY

The sound of RAIN pounds down on the deck above - - then
suddenly stops Elizabeth moves to the stern windows looks
out at the rolling sea below -- no escape there

She hears the sound of a VQICE calling gazes up wondering
EXT BLACK PEARL - CROW S NEST - DAY

High on the main mast Twigg cups his hands to his face calls
down

TWIGG
Isla de Muerta Isla de Muerta
off the port bow

ON DECK Barbossa moves to the rail The storm clouds are
breaking up On the horizon is a dark ominous shape ISLA DE
MUERTA Mostly sheer unfriendly cliffs that shoot straight into
the water It is surrounded by a slate grey sea

Barbossa grasps the rail with both hands his expression a
mixture of loathing and fear Jacoby approaches hesitant

JACOBY
Orders Captain

BARBOSSA
Bring her in not too close I wont
brave the reef not until high tide We
lay anchor before dark

Jacoby nods backs away Barbossa continues to stare -

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
that is if it first doesnt
sink back down to hell from where
it came

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

The Interceptor on open waters glorious her white sails
set wing-to-wing

EXT HMS INTERCEPTOR - DAY

CLOSE ON Jacks compass cradled in both hands Jack leans
over and studies it -- almost like hes praying

ON THE COMPASS -- the face shows old-fashioned rose petal
style direction markers below a quivering indicator that

settles on -- southeast

JACK
Bear three points starboard

AnaMaria turns the wheel adjusting course The ship leans
into the new direction Jack looks down -

ON THE COMPASS -- where the indicator spins reverses
settles on -- northeast

JACK (CONTD)
Six points port

AnaMaria frowns but follows the order turns the wheel
back and the ship responds

Will works on deck coiling a rope -- but he watches Jack
and AnaMaria clearly not happy Gibbs hobbles up

GIBBS
Left handed-ropes are coiled against
the sun or its bad luck
(twirls a finger)
Anty-clockwise

Gibbs takes over the task The ship shifts course again
Will has had enough

WILL

How do we expect to find an island no
one can find -- with a compass that
doesnt work

GIBBS
Now lad just because it dont point
north dont mean it dont work
(voice low)
That compass gives bearings to the Isla
de Muerta wherever it may lie

WILL
Really
(moves closer)
So whats the story on the
pistol

Gibbs settles in happy to have a willing listener

GIBBS
Ill tell lee Now Jack Sparrow
has an honest streak in him and
thats where the whole problem
starts This was when he was
Captain of the Black Pearl -

WILL
What He never told me that

GIBBS

Ah -- hes learned then Plays things
more close to the vest See Jack was a
cartographer back in Old England
Somehow I he came by the money to
commission the Pearl Hired himself a
crew promised each man an equal share

(lowers his voice)
So theyre forty days out and the
First Mate says everythings an equal
share that should mean the location of
the island too So Jack gave up the
bearings

(shakes his head)
That night there was mutiny

Gibbs voice is a whisper now so Will has to lean closer
GIBBS (CONTD)

Jack gave hisself up for the sake of
his loyal crewmen He was marooned on
an island left there to die

WILL
How did he get off the island

JACK
(loud)
I didnt

Will and Gibbs jump Jack is right there beside them
JACK (CONTD)

My bodys still there rotting
away and I am but a ghost

Will and Gibbs arent sure what to make of that Jack
laughs

GIBBS
How did you get off the island

JACK
Ah thats a dark and unpleasant
tale best left untold
He starts off

WILL
Wait -- what about the pistol

JACK
The pistol When a pirate is marooned
Will hes given a pistol with a single
shot No good for hunting or
surviving really But after three
weeks of starvation and thirst -- the
option of that pistol begins to look
good

Jack lets this sink in He pulls out the pistol raises it

JACK (CONTD)

But I survived And I still have

that single shot Its meant for

one man My mutinous first mate -

WILL
Barbossa

Jack shoots a glance at Will -- nods and moves away

On Barbossa face upturned No expression in his eyes

Around him a group of pirates Elizabeth among them stand
as still as stones in front of a dark cave opening Their
faces look upward their total lack of movement
disconcerting

Above the cave on a hillock the pirate Koehler gazes out
toward the horizon Slowly he TRANSFORMS head-to-toe from
pirate to SKELETON-

The MOON has climbed free of the storm clouds rising
large and full on the horizon The skeleton turns -

KOEHLER
Moonrise Captain First night of full

BARBOSSA
Hah
(to the pirates)
Be mindful of pits and crevasses
Stay together

He takes a torch Moves into the cave The pirates follow

INT ISLA DE MUERTE - CAVES - NIGHT
The group keeps together under the firelight The path
leads between boulders on a slope downhill From the echoes
and shadows its clear the cave system must be huge

Elizabeth glances over -- the torches illumine caverns off
to the side -- and just the edge of a mound of coins
Clearly there is more but the rest is lost in darkness

Twigg gazing upward in wonder moves a few feet away from
the group Barbossa grabs him as he nears a chasm

BARBOSSA
Careful mate Fall down there youd
die and miss Judgement Day -- for not
even the Lord himself1ll come look for

you here

Barbossa lets go and moves on descending down twisting
and turning but always down -

EXT HMS INTERCEPTOR - NIGHT

Cotton pulls a sail line looks out -- sees something He
lifts the parrot off his shoulder strokes it along the
back

COTTONS PARROT
Land HO Land HO LAND ho LAND
ho

Indeed the faint outline of Isla de Muerta is in the
distance on the port side Will stands excited jumps onto
the rigging for a better look

But AnaMaria at the helm stares at Cotton and the
parrot

ANAMARTA
How does he do that

JACK
Theyll be anchored on the lee side
Haul your wind and keep to the weather
of the island -
INT ISLA DE MUERTE - CAVES - NIGHT

Flickering torchlight Pirates stoop low to enter a cavern

-- and revealed is the spectacular treasure of Isla de
Muerta overflowing chests of coins gold and silver
ingots jewelry objects d art jade and ivory brightly
colored silks furniture jewels and pearls mirrors and
swords -anything and everything of value that might be
carried by ship is here

The pirates move through Elizabeth cant help but gaze in
wonder

ELIZABETH
The curse drove you to gather
this

BARBOSSA (0S)
Aye And not a bit of it any use
to us only hoarded But it will

drive us no longer

Elizabeth pauses staring at herself in a jewel-encrusted
mirror -- and then is pushed along by the pirates

EXT ISLA DE MUERTE - LAGOON - NIGHT

The Interceptor lies at anchor in the distance Closer
Jack and will row away from the larger vessel in a small
longboat toward the rocky shore

The RUSH of a waterfall grows louder Will looks ahead of
them is a black CAVE MOUTH right at water level

WILL
Whats that

JACK
Depends

WILL
On what

JACK
On whether the stories are all
true If they are thats a
waterfall that spills over at high
tide with a short drop to an

underground lagoon If not -

By now the moving water tugs on the longboat and they are
sucked in --

JACK (CONTD)
-- well too late
The boat rushes forward plunges into the darkness -
INT CAVES - UNDERWATER LAGOON - NIGHT

-- the longboat takes a harrowing drop over a short
waterfall but then lands safely in a gorgeous
underwater lagoon floats lazily toward a sandy shore

JACK
Chalk one up for the stories

Will leaps out into the water pulls the boat ashore -
INT CAVES - BED CAVERN - NIGHT

The pirate group reaches the end of a small chamber of
mostly jewels and pearl piled around a large bed -

INT CAVES - MAIN CAVERN - NIGHT

-- and then emerge into the largest cavern of all also
crammed with treasure including several mountains of gold
coins that reach the ceiling Treasure everywhere -

Except for one spot in the center A hole in the ceiling
lets in a column of moonlight which illumines

A stone chest lid pushed back decorated with carved Aztec
glyphs filled with gold coins identical to Wills
medallion A sharp stone knife lies on top

In front of it buried in the sand is a skeleton -- and
this one doesnt look like its going to move ever again
judging by the sword in its back A crab scurries away from
it as the group approaches

BARBOSSA
Here we stand before the cursed
treasure of Cortez himself Won by
blood it demands blood in return

All eyes turn -- onto Elizabeth Pintle takes the stone
knife from the chest approaches her Elizabeth shrinks

back but is held by two other pirates

Pintel grins Grabs her by the wrist She turns her head
away shuts her eyes

Pintle raises the knife
and then very carefully daintily uses just the sharp
tip of the knife to just prick Elizabeths finger

One tiny red drop of blood appears and drips down onto the
medallion

Elizabeth opens her eyes surprised
PINTEL

What did you expect Were all
gentlemen here right and proper

The pirates laugh Barbossa takes the medallion grins at
Elizabeth

BARBOSSA
You know the first thing Im going
to do after the curse is lifted
(grins)
Eat a whole bushel of apples

Barbossa approaches the chest shining in the beam of
moonlight

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
What was begun by blood let blood
now end

He tosses the gold medallion onto the others

The pirates tense waiting expectant A long beat They
all look at each other look at themselves Nothing
happens

KOEHLER
Did it work

DEADEYE
I dont feel no different

JACOBY
How do we tell

Barbossa frowns draws his pistol and SHOOTS the pirate
next to him -- Jacoby -- square in the chest Jacoby reacts
in shock grabs his chest but doesnt die

KOEHLER
Youre not dead
JACOBY
No
(realizes)
He shot me

TWIGG

It didnt work The curse is still
upon us

Barbossa searches his mind for an answer turns to
Elizabeth

BARBOSSA
You Maid Your father What was
his name
(grabs her roughly)
Was your father William Turner

Elizabeth takes time to smile before answering

ELIZABETH
No

The pirates cry out in alarm Barbossa gathers himself
getting his rage under steely control

BARBOSSA
Wheres his child The child that
sailed from England eight years
ago the child who is the real
owner of that medallion the child
in whose veins flows the blood of
William Turner Where

Barbossa SLAPS her hard across the face sending her
sprawling

JACOBY
(to Pintel)
You brought us the wrong person

PINTEL
She had the medallion Shes the

right age She said her name was
Turner

TWIGG
(to Barbossa)
You brought us here for nothing

Barbossa whirls on him --
BARBOSSA

If you had sailed with Morgan for
ten years like I have youd know
not to question me

Elizabeth sits up watching the pirates argue for a moment
unnoticed Suddenly a scabbard comes down right above
her

Startled Elizabeth looks up --

-- Will is at the top of a mound of coins reaching down
with his scabbard for her to grab onto

Elizabeth quickly leans forward takes the bloodied
medallion from the pile Reaches back grabs the scabbard
Will pulls her up -

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
If any coward here dare challenge
me let him speak Any more talk
Ill chain ye to a cannon and send
ye to the watery depths

A sound catches his attention -- coins falling He looks
up sees Will and Elizabeth at the top of the treasure
stack

ATOP THE STACK Will grabs a large shield flings them
forward -- the two ride down the mountain of coins on the
far side slide through a small opening -

INT ISLA DE MUERTE - SMALL CAVERN - NIGHT

Behind them loose coins from their slide come down in an
avalanche sealing the entrance

Elizabeth jumps up silver platter in hand ready to swing
-Jack catches her before she can do any damage They
recognize each other

ELIZABETH
You

JACK
Me

ELIZABETH

Youre in league with Barbossa
JACK
No Im -- rescuing you

Elizabeth cant comprehend that one

ELIZABETH
You

Will gains his footing in the rubble

WILL
Miss Swann Were here to rescue
you
(sounds of pursuit
approaching)
Its going badly

JACK
This way

They race off toward a bit of moonlight -
EXT ISLA DE MUERTE - NIGHT

The three climb up a dark crevasse that leads out onto the
island Will takes Elizabeths hand helps her

WILL
m glad we got here in time

ELIZABETH
Truthfully -- you were a bit late

fq

JACK
The trick isnt getting here its
getting away

fq

As if on cue they hear the yells of pirates coming
closer They take off -

EXT ISLA DE MUERTE - CLEARING - NIGHT

The three race through the rocks the sounds of pursuit
close behind Suddenly Jack stops

ELIZABETH
Come on

JACK

No This wont work
(a quick decision)
Ill stay behind and fight them
You go on

Will and Elizabeth stare at him

WILL
No

JACK
Ill lead them away

The sounds are closer

JACK (CONTD)
Go to the opposite end of the
island and signal the ship Ill
keep em busy

WILL
Are you sure Jack -- this is not
something you have to do

JACK
Im sure When youve led the kind
of life I have there are debts
that must be paid Maybe I can
balance the scales a little

Will nods hesitates gives Jack his sword - - now Jack
has two one for each hand Elizabeth gives him a quick
kiss

Will and Elizabeth race away and are gone

Jack watches them for a moment turns to face the pirates
He sticks the two swords in the ground crossed Leans
casually against a rock

A group of pirates round a corner cutlasses drawn ready
to fight -- but Jack raises his hand

JACK (CONTD)
I invoke the right of parlay
according to the Code of the
Brethren set down by the pirates
Morgan and Bartholomew

EXT ISLA DE MUERTE - NIGHT
Jack stands before Barbossa surrounded by pirates Jack

has a wide smile on his face -- and Barbossa doesnt like
it
BARBOSSA
Im inclined to kill you now Jack
Sparrow without so much as a
word if you dont lose that grin
from your face

Jacks smile remains Barbossa puts a hand to his cutlass -
JACK
The womans blood didnt work did
it
Barbossa hesitates

JACK (CONTD)
I know whos blood you need to
end the curse

BARBOSSA
Say the name or I slit your
throat

JACK

No you wont

Barbossa nods Pintel steps forward puts a blade to Jacks
throat Jacks smile widens

PINTEL
Now

BARBOSSA (NODS)
Now
(Pintel grins)
No dont kill him

Surprised Pintel lowers his cutlass Jacks expression
hasnt changed

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
Allow me the humor of listening to
your terms

JACK
Simple I have something you want more
than anything The way to free you from
the curse of the treasure You have
something I want -- more than anything

BARBOSSA
The Pearl
(laughs)
Oh thats fine And just how do
you expect this to work

JACK
You give me the Pearl Then I tell
you who you need

Barbossa stares at him incredulous

BARBOSSA
Thats your offer You sailing
away nice and pretty with the
Black Pearl and all I have is a
name

JACK
Thats right

BARBOSSA
Im supposed to trust you

The pirates laugh

JACK
Im a man of my word

The pirates laugh louder

JACK (CONT D)
You see Ive got this honest streak in me
-- in its own way a sort of curse Oh and
theres the fact that you have no choice

BARBOSSA
Ill torture it out of you

JACK
You left me on a desert island --
what worse can you do

Jack is still smiling intentionally smug now Barbossa
sees his options dwindling begins to pace

BARBOSSA
Blast you Ill throw you in
prison

JACK

Wait as long as you like

BARBOSSA
Youre setting me up for a double
cross you with the ship and me with
nothing more than your word

JACK
Lets say I tell you the wrong
person What would you do

BARBOSSA
Track you down and -

He sees where Jack is headed

JACK
And if I tell you the truth you become
mortal and you wont come near me
because you know Id kill you

Barbossa hesitates The pirates are amazed at how the tide
has turned Barbossa has gone past considering the idea
and might even do it

BARBOSSA
Jack I dont trust you and
thats a fact Never trust a
smiling man you can lay to that

JACK
See thats where were different
I trust you to do what it

takes to get what you want

BARBOSSA
Youre playing this as close to
the edge as any man Ill give you
that
(decides smiles)

We might just have to sign
articles you and I Jack youre
a pirate at heart thats certain

Jack nods

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
Pintel set sail If this fool plan
is to work well need the medallion
and that means catching the ship which
brought em here

Jack is caught completely off guard For the first time
his smile fades
JACK

What -- you dont have the medallion
BARBOSSA
That fool woman took it You be
careful around her Jack -- shes
pretty enough shell steal your
heart -- but pure evil inside
JACK

Ill watch my back

BARBOSSA
Bosun Set up Mr Sparrows quarters
nice and fine in the brig

(to Jack a smile)
Meaning no disrespect of course

Jack nods and is taken away Barbossa stares after him
not hiding his mistrust

EXT INTERCEPTOR - DAY

At full sail headed out to sea Gibbs glances at Elizabeth
and Will talking alone on the forecastle -- shakes his
head

GIBBS
Two women on board A man dont have to
be superstitious to know thats
trouble

Elizabeth holds the medallion and finishes her tale

ELIZABETH
» you were in danger so I took
the medallion And Ive kept it ever
since They thought I was you that
they needed my blood And it didnt
work

She hands him the medallion

WILL
Why would my father send this to me

ELIZABETH
To keep it away from them No pirate
would sail to London for fear of
Execution Dock
WILL
If I had known-

ELIZABETH
(anticipating him)
-- then we never would have met

Will nods They hold each others gaze a moment Will turns
away first leans on the rail Looks out to sea back the
direction they came

WILL
I cant believe he would make such
a sacrifice for us

ELIZABETH
I guess you can never truly know
someone elses heart

Will glances at her and nods

AT THE HELM Gibbs peers forward scanning the horizon
There

is a tiny island in front of them

GIBBS
Shift your heading steer clear of that
island Fifteen degrees starboard

On the aft deck Cotton concentrates on his work securing
a halyard Suddenly Cottons parrot flaps its wings takes
off lands on the starboard bulwark squawking -

COTTONS PARROT
Dead men tell NO tales Dead men tell
NO tales Dead men tell NO tales

Cotton looks up - on the horizon following black sails
Gibbs and AnaMaria appear and see the ship

ANAMARTA
Can we outrun them

GIBBS
Not a chance Make for the reef

EXT CARIBBEAN OCEAN - DAY

Miles of blue water The Interceptor tacks leaving a long
white wake The Black Pearl matches it -- gaining
EXT BLACK PEARL - DAY

Barbossa and Pintel eye the Interceptor two hounds chasing
the fox

PINTEL
Whats he doing Is he going to
run her aground

EXT INTERCEPTOR - DAY

The Black Pearl is now close behind the Interceptor -- and
the Interceptor is headed for the island

GIBBS
Drop the forward anchor

A SAILOR at the stern of the ship pulls a release and the
ships anchor races down into the water the metal chain
jumping and twisting on deck

The chain stops and the Sailor locks it -

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

With its forward momentum and the anchor down the
Interceptor to turn quickly pivoting around the anchor

EXT BLACK PEARL - DAY

Barbossa and Pintel watch as the huge ship brings its
cannons to bear right in front of them

BARBOSSA
All hands Prepare to come about

But for now the Interceptor has the advantage and takes
it

its cannons boom and cannonballs rain down
INT BLACK PEARL - BRIG - DAY

Jack sees what he can out the porthole In the cell with
him is Twigg acting as a guard

JACK
Dont hit my ship I mean kill
the lying scoundrel -
(to Twigg)
Im a little conflicted here
Twigg just stares
EXT INTERCEPTOR - DAY

Elizabeth watches as the Black Pearl comes about -- and
then there is the low loud RUMBLE of two dozen cannons
firing as one The Interceptor is hit A barrage of shots
follow most find their mark

Sailors dive for cover leaving their cannons clearly they
are overmatched

EXT BLACK PEARL - PORT SIDE - DAY
Barbossa laughs

BARBOSSA
Strike your colors you bloody
cockroaches

EXT INTERCEPTOR - DAY
Another round of fire Barbossa shows no mercy

ANAMARTA
Looks like they mean to send us under

GIBBS
There -- shes raised the Jolly Roger
upside down
AnaMaria Gibbs Cotton even Elizabeth -- all know what

this means Will doesnt He looks to Gibbs for an
explanation

GIBBS (CONT D)
Its a signal If we resist it wont
just be death Therell be torture as
well

WILL
Were not going to just surrender

GIBBS That we are
The Black Pearl fires again a double-ball shot with a

chain connecting the two It hits the main mast dead ani a
CRACKING SPLINTING sound as it breaks falls to the deck
Barbossa moves his ship alongside preparing to board

WILL
We can at least fight -- we might
be able to kill a few-

GIBBS
Will -- itll go worse for us -- for
Elizabeth especially -- if we fight

Will stares -- and nods But his expression is still
defiant

The deck slants the ship is sinking pirates swarm across
on ropes and take control of the Interceptor

EXT BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - DAY

The top masts of the HMS Interceptor sink into the
smooth crystal waters of the Caribbean -

-- as Will and Elizabeth held by pirates are brought
before Barbossa -- and see that Jack stands beside him
manacled

Gibbs AnaMaria and Cotton and the other crewmembers huddle
together

Barbossas wrath falls on Elizabeth

BARBOSSA
Welcome back Miss Last time on board
you played me right clever make
pretending and all I hope your stay
this time is more pleasant Boys show
her some hospitality

He shoves her into a group of pirates they yell their
approval She is pushed from one to another

This goads Will to action He head-butts the pirate behind
him grabs a pistol waves it at the pirates

WILL
She goes free

Will leaps onto the ships rail He steadies himself with a
hand on the rigging Points the pistol at Barbossa

BARBOSSA
Whats in your head boy
WILL
She Goes Free

BARBOSSA
Youve got one shot -- and we cant
die

WILL

You cant I can

He leans out over the ocean

ELIZABETH
No
Jack pushes forward
JACK
Will -- dont do anything stupid

Dont say anything stupid -

WILL
My name is Will Turner the son of
Bootstrap Bill Turner His blood runs
in my veins
(raises the gun to his head)

You need my blood And on my word I
will pull this trigger and sink all
the way down to Davy Jones Locker

Pintel squints at Will the pirates murmur surprise

TWIGG
Its true - hes the spittin image of
old Bootstrap Even talks the same

Jack drops his head Barbossa grins at him

BARBOSSA
Looks like youre back to having
nothing to offer

PINTEL
And hers got Old Bills courage A
curse on him and you

Barbossa steps forward
BARBOSSA

Enough of that
(to Will)
Name your terms

WILL
Elizabeth goes free

BARBOSSA
We got that part Anything else

WILL
And Jack And the crew Free and
unharmed I f you agree then

I will remain with you
Barbossa considers his crew waits Finally -
BARBOSSA

Agreed You have my word as a
gentleman of fortune -

ELIZABETH
Will -- you cant trust him

WILL
You must swear by the Holy Bible

BARBOSSA
Eh You have my word then -- on the
Good Book I do swear and the Lord
spare my worthless soul

Barbossa crosses himself as do many of his men

Will lowers the gun steps down -- the pirates surround
him They snatch away the pistol

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
Boatswain Take your captives
belowdecks Chain them in the galley
and teach em how to row

Gibbs AnaMaria Cotton and the rest are led away under
guard Barbossa looks out to sea toward the islet

BARBOSSA (CONTD)

Hah Look there Thats the very
same island we made Jack governor
of on our last trip

(nods)
When you sail the open sea as long as
I you learn to trust the signs fate
sends your way
GIBBS
(dejected)
Amen to that

BARBOSSA
Jack Elizabeth Im a man of my
word and youre to be set free right
quick
(loudly)

Men break out the plank

A CHEER goes up from the pirates Will realizes what
Barbossa intends to do struggles with his captors

WILL
No You gave your word

BARBOSSA
Quiet boy or youll lose your tongue
Those as know me know I wouldnt cross
my word and bring down bad luck on the

ship

(nods)
I agreed to set them free I didnt say
when nor where

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY
The Black Pearl lies at anchor closer now to the islet
EXT BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - DAY

Jack wrists still bound stands in the classic walking
the plank pose Elizabeth is next in line Pirates crowd
the ships rail to watch

JACK
Its pure evil to make a Captain walk
the plank of his own ship twice in one
lifetime No good can come of it

BARBOSSA
Now Jack That reef is less than a
league distant Its a square deal all
around and you cant hope for better

JACK
Someone needs to cut these bonds then

Barbossa smiles shows a pistol Points it at Jack
BARBOSSA
Youd best take a swim Jack

JACK
The last time you did this you

left me a pistol with one shot

The pirates mutter agreement

PINTEL
Thats proper sir according to the
code

BARBOSSA

By the Powers youre right

( turns around)
Wheres Jacks pistol Whos got
it Bring it forward

JACK
A gentleman might give us two pistols
seeing as there are two of us this
time

A pirate hands Jacks pistol to Barbossa
BARBOSSA

Tell you what Ill give you one
pistol and let you be the gentleman

an shoot the lady and starve to death
yourself
(grins)

That is presuming youre not both drownded

The pirates laugh Barbossa tosses Jack the pistol -- but
over his head and down into the water with a splash

BARBOSSA (CONTID)
So how did you get off that island
anyway

JACK
You can go to your grave not knowing

BARBOSSA
Thats fair

Jack glares at Barbossa Then hes prodded with a cutlass
takes a step out Reaches the end of the plank -- steps
off

Jack plunges down into the water Appears on the surface
floundering struggles to stay afloat Will and Elizabeth
exchange helpless looks there is nothing they can do

BARBOSSA (CONTD)

The ladys next But first Ill be
wanting that dress back if you please

Elizabeth hesitates then strips it off leaving her in
a silk slip She throws it at him

ELIZABETH
Here -- it will go well with your
black heart

Barbossa indicates the plank

ELIZABETH (CONT D)
I will not walk into the ocean
Youll have to throw me in

Barbossa raises an eyebrow grins nods

BARBOSSA
Have at her lads

The pirates rush to comply Lift her up toss her over the
rail -- with a scream she falls --

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - UNDERWATER - DAY

We follow Elizabeth amid foam and bubbles as she PLUNGES
down

through the water Blue and clear with streaks of sunlight
cutting down bright coral and tropical fish and a lovely
young woman in a silk dress if it werent for the
mortal danger the scene could be described as gorgeous

Elizabeth spots Jack below her now sinking struggling
She swims down unties his bonds

Elizabeth starts for the surface Inexplicably Jack swims
the other way further down into the depths

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

Elizabeth breaks the surface looks around And then
finally Jack appears sucking in air He shows what he went
after his pistol He tucks it into his shirt

ELIZABETH
You went back for that We need to
head for the reef

She starts swimming Jack hesitates The Black Pearl is
already underway he stares at it

JACK
Thats the second time Ive had to
watch that man sail away with my ship

He turns away and swims after Elizabeth
EXT ISLET - BEACH - DAY

CLOSE ON The surf line Elizabeths feet leave prints in
the sand and then meet up with matching footprints she
made earlier going in the same direction She has walked
all the way around the island

JACK (0S)
Not all that big is it

Jack lays on the beach He has dismantled his pistol the
parts ball and powder dry on his scarf

ELIZABETH
Has it changed since the last time you
were here

JACK
The trees are taller

Jack checks to see if the pistol parts are dry they are
He sets about re-assembling and loading his pistol

ELIZABETH
I hope you have no intention of using
that

Jack has finished putting his pistol back together He
shoves it in his belt walks off

JACK
Not yet Ask me again in a few weeks

Elizabeth cant believe it

ELIZABETH
Captain Sparrow We have to get
off this island -- immediately

JACK
Dont be thinking Im not already
working on it

He climbs up toward a clump of palm trees Digs for
something beneath the sand He finds it a large iron ring

ELIZABETH
What is that Is there a boat
under there

Jack heaves the trap door up and over revealing a pit
Inside are barrels and bottles of rum all covered with
dust and cobwebs long abandoned Jacks face falls

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
What Whats wrong How will this
help us get off the island

JACK
It wont It wont and so we
wont

He jumps down into the pit cracks open a bottle of rum
takes a swig

ELIZABETH
But you did it before Last
time -

JACK

Last time I was here a grand
total of three days Last time
the rumrunners who used this
island as a cache came by and I
bartered passage off

JACK (CONTD)

But from the looks of this
theyve long beenout of business
and so that wont be happening
again

(takes another swig)
We probably have your friend
Norrington to thank for that

ELIZABETH
So thats it Thats the secret
grand adventure of the infamous

Jack Sparrow You spent three days
on the beach drinking rum
JACK
Welcome to the Caribbean love

He gathers up a few bottles heads for the beach

JACK (CONTD)
You should look at our contretemps
this way weve got shade trees
thank the Lord Weve got some
food on the trees thank the Lord
again And weve got rum praise
the Lord We can stay alive a
month maybe more Keep a weather
eye open for passing ships and
our chances are fair

ELIZABETH
A month Will doesnt have a
month Weve got to do something
to help him

JACK
Youre right
(hoists the bottle)
Heres luck to you Will Turner

He drinks -- and defiantly returns Elizabeths angry gaze
But then turns away sits down

JACK (CONTD)
Dont be thinking Im happy about
this Elizabeth But I see no use
in wailing and gnashing my teeth
over that which I can do nothing

about

ELIZABETH
Not when you can drink instead at
least

Jack tosses her a bottle
JACK

Try it It goes down rough but it

goes down - - and the second swig

goes down easier

Elizabeth considers Comes to a decision She unseals the
bottle takes a swig They sit in silence for a bit
ELIZABETH
And you will call me Miss Swann

Jack toasts her you got it Elizabeth studies her
bottle gives Jack a sidelong glance Back to her bottle

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
(under her breath)
Drink up me hearties yo ho

JACK
What What was that
(Elizabeth smiles)
Something funny Miss Swann share
Please

ELIZABETH
Nothing its nothing Just
Im reminded of a song I learned
as a child A song about pirates

JACK
I know a lot of songs about pirates
but none Id teach a child Lets hear

it

ELIZABETH
Oh no its silly Back in
England we didnt know a thing
about pirates really They seemed

so romantic and daring -
Jack likes the way that sounds

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
(looks at him)
That was before I met one of
course

JACK

Now I must hear this song An
authentic pirate song Have at it

ELIZABETH
Well perhaps with a bit more
to drink I might

JACK
More to drink
He gathers two more bottles tosses one to her She drops
her half-finished bottle to catch it Opens it takes a
sip

JACK (CONTD)
Well

Elizabeth clears her throat begins to sing self-
consciously becoming stronger as she goes on

ELIZABETH
We pillage we plunder we rifle
we loot Drink up me hearties yo
ho

She gestures for him to drink He does

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
We kidnap and ravage and we dont
give a hoot Drink up me hearties
yo ho -

EXT ISLET - BEACH - LATER - NIGHT

The middle of the night A fire BLAZES Jack and Elizabeth
are roaring drunk arm in arm singing the song all the way
up to the stars --

JACK
I LOVE this song

Irish ballad)
Aye but were loved by our mums and our
dads Drink up me hearties yo ho

They hoist their bottles but only Jack drinks He drains
the bottle then tosses it away

JACK (CONTD)
When I get the Black Pearl back Im
Elizabeth

and well sing it all the time

ELIZABETH
Youll be positively the most fearsome
pirates to sail the Spanish Main

salutes the idea with her bottle Jack doesnt

have a bottle to salute back She hands him hers He
drinks then settles shakily to the ground Elizabeth sits

beside him

Elizabeth

Elizabeth
She picks

JACK
Not just the Spanish Main The whole
ocean the whole world Wherever we

want to go we go Thats what a ship
is you know Not just a keel anda
hull and a deck and sails Thats what

a ship need but what a ship is --
what the Black Pearl really-is is
freedom

lays her head on his shoulder

ELIZABETH
Jack it must be so terrible for you
to be trapped here on this island all
over again

JACK
Ah well the company is better
than last time And the scenery
has definitely improved

ELIZABETH
(coy)

Mr Sparrow Im not sure Ive had
enough rum to allow that kind of talk

JACK
Weve got a few bottles left
and weve yet to tap the kegs

shrugs with a sleight -- but promising -- smile
up the empty bottle from the ground holds it up

ELIZABETH
To freedom

JACK
To the Black Pearl
They tap the bottles together Elizabeth feigns a drink as
he chugs He taps his bottle against her again She laughs
feigns another drink -

EXT ISLET - BEACH - MORNING

CLOSE ON -- JACKS FACE dead asleep lying in the
sunlight His nose twitches A bit of SMOKE drifts by His
nose twitches again His eyes open

Jack GROANS and sits up He rubs his head looks over -

-- all of the foliage in the middle of the island is ON
FIRE Smoke rises high up into the clear blue sky

Jack leaps to his feet He sees Elizabeth as she pours out
the last of the rum dowsing a scrub brush at the base of a
palm tree It goes up in FLAMES She rolls the barrel
forward -- it starts to BURN merrily

Jack cant believe his eyes

JACK
What are you doing Youve burned
our food the shade -- the rum
ELIZABETH

Yes the rum is gone

She wipes her hands together One of the rum barrels in the
fire EXPLODES

JACK
Why

ELIZABETH
One because it is a vile drink that
turns even the most respectable men
into scoundrels Two -

She points to the sky

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
That signal is over a thousand feet
high which means it can be seen for
two hundred leagues in every direction
The entire Royal Navy is out to sea
looking for me -- do you think there is
even a chance they could mass it
JACK
You -- you burned up the island for a
one-time chance at being spotted

ELIZABETH
Exactly

Elizabeth turns toward the sea

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Just you wait Captain In an hour
maybe two keep a weather eye open
and youll be seeing white sails on
that horizon

She sits down determined Shields her eyes scans the
water waiting searching Jack is speechless He throws up
his hands stalks up the sand dune just to get away from
her

EXT ISLET - LEEWARD SHORE - DAY

At the crest of the dune Jack stops -- and stares
incredulous We come around to see what he is looking at -

Past Jack anchored the other side of the island white
sails glorious against the turquoise waters is the HMS
Dauntless A longboat is already being rowed toward them
Jack shakes his head

JACK

Theyll be no living with her
after this

EXT HMS DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - DAY

Norrington gives Elizabeth a hand disembarking from the
raised long boat

NORRINGTON
Elizabeth Im relieved youre
safe
(re Jack)

Clap him in irons And behind his
back this time

ELIZABETIT
Commodore you cant do that

NORRINGTON
Youre speaking up for him again

ELIZABETH
He can locate Isla de Muerta --
but I doubt hell be willing to
help us from the brig

JACK
(shes right)
We had time to get to know each other

NORRINGTON
We are bound for Port Royal not
Isla de Muerta

ELIZABETH
No The pirates have taken Will -

NORRINGTON
Your father is frantic with worry
Our mission was to rescue you and
return home That is what we shall
do Mr Turners fate is
regrettable But so was his
decision to engage in piracy

ELIZABETH
Commodore please

JACK
Norrington think about it the
Black Pearl its captain and
crew the last pirate threat in

the Caribbean How can you pass
that up

NORRINGTON
By remembering that I serve
others not only myself

ELIZABETH
Commodore I beg you -- please do
this for me As a wedding
gift

NORRINGTON

I am to understand that you will
accept my marriage proposal on the
condition I rescue Mr Turner

ELIZABETH
Not as a condition -- a request
Norrington considers To Gillette
NORRINGTON
Free Mister Sparrow and prepare to
come about Hell give you our heading

Gillette unlocks Jacks manacles Jack raises an eyebrow

JACK
Congratulations sir

Crew men lead Jack toward the bridge Sailors go about
their tasks and the ship begins its slow turn

NORRINGTON
Elizabeth I hereby withdraw my
proposal

ELIZABETH
What

NORRINGTON
I know now where your heart truly
lies

Elizabeth looks at Norrington seeing him in a new light

ELIZABETH
And now I know where yours
does as well

They gaze at each other for a moment Norrington looks
away

NORRINGTON
You may seclude yourself in my
cabin Im afraid we do not have
any ladies clothing aboard

ELIZABETH
Then I can wear mens clothing

NORRINGTON
That would hardly be proper

ELIZABETH
Well I am not going to stay
hidden in a some cabin 80 I
suppose its going to be heaving
bosoms and bare ankles for the
remainder of the voyage

Norrington is exasperated but then cant help but grin -
this is exactly why he loves her She grins back at him -
shes not going to change

NORRINGTON
Murtogg take our guest below and find
her some trousers and a shirt

Elizabeth smiles allows herself to be escorted away
Norrington watches her go then turns his gaze to the
sea

INT THE BLACK PEARL - BRIG - DAY

Pintel enters the cell It appears empty -- but thats
because Will is hanging from the rafters trying to shove
up the ceiling planks with his legs

PINTEL
That aint going to work Thats the
gun deck above yea

Will drops lightly to the deck Suddenly

WILL
What happened to William Turner

PINTEL
Ah William Turner Stupid blighter He
threw in with us after we relieved Jack
Sparrow of his captaincy but turned
out it never sat well with him-
particularly after we found Cortes’
treasure and its peculiar condition
He thought we deserved to be cursed
for leaving ol Jack to the fate we
did Thats why he sent off a piece of
the treasure -- to you as it were so
it would never be recovered and so
cursed we remain

WILL
And then he ran And hes hiding out
someplace where you havent been able
to find him

PINTEL
Thats a nice thought to be sure and
I wager your da wishes hed thought it
hisself But no See what hed done
didnt sit too well with Captain
Barbossa so he chained a cannon to
his legs and dumped him over

Will reacts with shock at the account of his fathers fate

PINTEL (CONTD)

Yep last I saw of Bootstrap Bill
was his face looking up as he
sank down to the crushing black
oblivion of Davy Jones locker

(sighs)
It was only after we found out we
needed his blood to solve the curse
Thats what you call ironic

Barbossa appears behind Pintel flanked by several other
pirates He regards Will for a moment then

BARBOSSA
Bring him

EXT H M S DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - EVENING

Jack goes to the rail and waits pretending to look out at
the sea Elizabeth dressed in sailors clothes to
excellent effect joins him

ELIZABETH
You didnt tell Commodore Norrington
everything

JACK
Nor did you I noticed

ELIZABETH
He might delay the rescue and
that would be too late

JACK
Exactly

ELIZABETH
These men will be facing an enemy
that seemingly cannot be killed

JACK
I have a plan If it succeeds then any
battle will be decidedly brief and

one-sided

ELIZABETH
Whats your plan

LOOKOUT (0S)
LAND HO

Isla de Muerta lay dark and menacing on the horizon

NORRINGTON
Elizabeth -- below decks I will
not compromise your safety

She starts to speak he turns away

NORRINGTON (CONTD)
Lieutenant escort Elizabeth to my
quarters and make sure she stays
there

Norrington gazes through his spyglass at the island Jack
watches with some amusement as Elizabeth is escorted away

NORRINGTON (CONTD)
I dont like the situation mister
Sparrow The island is riddled
with caves I will not put my men
at a disadvantage

JACK
Funny I was thinking along those lines
How about you let me go in alone and
while youre setting up an ambush Ill
trick the pirates out to you

NORRINGTON
You would do that

JACK
They left me stranded Twice What
have you got to lose

NORRINGTON
(looks at him)
Nothing I wouldnt be please to be rid
of

JACK
(smiles)
I knew youd listen to reason

EXT ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVE ENTRANCE - EVENING

Torches are lit Barbossa leads Will guarded by Pintel and
a band of pirates into the caves
EXT HMS DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - NIGHT

A long boat is prepared to be lowered over the side Jack
wraps his pistol securely in an oilskin pouch

JACK
That chart I drew upll get you
past the reefs If youre
steersmans good enough that is

NORRINGTON
Ill be at the wheel myself

JACK
Ill slip in talk them into to come
out and youll be free to blow holy
high heaven the whole lot of them

The crewmen release the lines and the boat drops -
INT ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVES - NIGHT

The pirate group moves deeper into the caves Will moves
along unwillingly

PINTEL
No reason to fret Its just a prick of
the finger and a few drops of blood

BARBOSSA
Turner blood doesnt flow pure in
his veins
(grins)
Best play it safe and spill it all

PINTEL
I guess there is a reason to fret

EXT ISLA DE MUERTE - NIGHT

The Dauntless drifts into the lagoon Norrington and his
men prepare to go ashore h

INT ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVES - NIGHT

Lit by torchlight Will notices a crack runs between the
floor and the wall of the cave widening into a ravine

BARBOSSA
Careful now You could fall in and
still be wondern when youll hit dirt
Will makes a decision He intentionally stumbles Pintel

shoves him forward -- Will continues forward grabs the
pirate in front of him swings him into the wall of the
cave Catches the pirates torch and uses it to ward off
the others

WILL
You deserve to be cursed -- and
remain cursed

He steps to one side -- and drops into the ravine The wall
of the ravine becomes a loose gravel slope Will hits it
and tumbles down disappears into black

BARBOSSA
Blast him A pox on him and his
father and the whole damnable
line Fan out Find him

INT DAUNTLESS - CAPTAINS QUARTERS - NIGHT

Elizabeth looks out the Captains small porthole -- sees
boats laden with Navy men headed for shore

She turns away from the porthole wishing there was
something she could do Suddenly there is a flutter at the
window--

Cottons parrot is there

COTTONS PARROT
Drink UP me hearties yo ho Drink UP me
hearties yo ho

The bird flutters off Elizabeth races to the porthole and
then to the stern window to see it flyaway

She looks down -- and there fastened to the stern of the
ship is a small rowboat

INT ISLA DEMUERTA - CAVES - NIGHT

Will races forward turning this way and that He sees a
light ahead heads for it turns a corner -

-- and runs straight into Jack

JACK
Do you have any idea where youre
going

WILL
Jack

JACK
Dont talk These caves magnify
sound Just follow me

EXT ISLA DE MUERTA - THE BEACH - NIGHT

Norrington and men land on the beach and spread out They
silently take up positions around the main cave entrance

INT CAVES - NIGHT

Jack leads Will out of a narrow passage -- and stops
staring Will is a few steps behind

WILL
Are you certain this is the right way

JACK
Its the right way

Will join him -- and see what Jack is staring at
Treasure piled on treasure sparkling glowing seemingly

endless At the center is the moonlit clearing and the
stone Aztec chest

BARBOSSA
Thank you Jack Sparrow

The jump -- Barbossa is standing right behind them flanked
by his men The trio whirl to run - - more pirates emerge
from hiding Nearly the entire crew of the Black Pearl is
there

The pirates grab Will and Jack Will struggles but Jack
does not fight at all

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
You couldnt have led him back
more directly if you knew exactly
where you were going

He laughs and moves toward the stone chest The pirates
follow dragging Will and Jack with them

WILL
You did know where you were going
You did lead us directly to them

(Jacks silence confirms it)
Why

Jack looks away -- as Will is manhandled toward the chest
Barbo8sa steps up to him (becoming skeletal in the
moonlight) and puts the medallion around Wills neck

He picks up the stone knife

BARBOSSA
What was begun by blood let blood now
end

He raises the knife to Wills throat -

JACK
You dont want to be doing that

Barbossa pretends to think about his words

BARBOSSA
No I really think I do

JACK
(shrugs)
All right then

That makes Barbossa pause He steps out of the moonlight

BARBOSSA
Why dont I want to do this

JACK
Because right about now the HMS
Dauntless is lying in wait in the
harbor

WILL
Jack

JACK
- - and its guns and crew will cut you
and your men to pieces the moment you
step outside these caves

A buzz of apprehension sweeps through the pirates

PINTEL
Do you believe him
BARBOSSA
No
(indicates Will)
But him I believe He is genuinely

angry

JACK
Youve no hope of surviving
Norringtons attack that is if

youre mortal

BARBOSSA
Whatre you suggesting

Jack shakes off the hands holding him strolls toward
Barbossa Will and the chest of coins

JACK
Simple Dont kill the boy yet
Wait for a more opportune moment

Will glares listening to every word he says Jack scoops
up a handful of coins from the chest

JACK (CONTD)
(drops the coins one-by-
one back into the chest)

Like after youve killed Every
Last One of Norringtons men
BARBOSSA

I cant help wondering Jack why
youre being so helpful and all Last
time you did that it didnt end 80
well for you

JACK
The situation has changed

BARBOSSA
That so

JACK
Aye See after youre done with the
Royal Navy youll have a bit of a
problem the HMS Dauntless There
youll be with two lovely ships on
your hands and what to do Of course
youll decide you deserve the bigger
one and whos to argue The Dauntless
a first-rate ship-of-line and with it
you can rule the seas
(beat)

But if youre Captain of the Dauntless
whos left for the Black Pearl

Jack smiles and spreads his hands me

JACK (CONTD)

I sail for you as part of your fleet I
give you fifteen percent of my plunder
and you get to introduce yourself at
tea parties and brothels as Commodore
Barbossa

(sticks out his hand)
Do we have an accord

Barbossa licks his lips Its tempting

JACK (CONTD)
Now you can take care of the
Dauntless right

BARBOSSA
Men Are you up for it

The pirates yell to the affirmative

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
Mr Pintel select five men to
stay here Take the rest of the
men out not through the caves

Jacks expression falters this he hadnt planned for

JACK
Theres another exit

BARBOSSA
Aye for us there is

EXT LAGOON - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

Moonlight shines down into the shallow waters brightening
coral sparkling over the rippled sand floor

Suddenly all the fish SCATTER Briefly the waters are
empty

And then FIGURES appear in the distance seeming to waver
in the shifting current They scuffle forward kicking up
clouds of sand --
The figures resolve into the skeleton PIRATES moving
silently across the lagoon floor swords glinting The
tatters of their clothing drift in the water Their skull
heads are fixed in an endless grin

The LEAD PIRATE glides forward -

And stops next to a huge iron ANCHOR -- twice his height
even buried halfway into the sand A heavy CHAIN with
barrel-sized links climbs up toward the surface -

A SHADOW falls across the Lead Pirate -- he TRANSFORMS and
we see that it is Pintel He looks up -

Above the heavy chain leads to the giant bottom hull of
the HMS Dauntless silhouetted by moonlight

The huge shift drifts again spilling moonlight below -

And the pirates gathered around the anchor are once again
SKELETONS staring with upturned faces The Pintel-skeleton
puts a knife between his teeth starts to crawl up the iron
rings

Other pirates crowd forward and soon the anchor-chain is
clustered with skeletons -

EXT LAGOON - NIGHT

Elizabeth has the small boat out and rows away from the
Dauntless looking ahead over her shoulder Cottons parrot
is nowhere to be seen

In the distance Pintel breaks the surface near the
Dauntless intent on climbing the anchor he looks over -

Just as Elizabeth rounds the point and rocks obscure the
small longboat from view

More skeleton-pirates appear and Pintel continues his
climb

EXT LAGOON - DAUNTLESS - NIGHT

Two SAILORS alert and vigilant stare out toward shore
The island reveals nothing but blackness

There is a scurrying sound -- bones scraping against wood -
and the sailors JUMP They listen intently -- nothing

TALL SAILOR
Ship rats Big ones
SHORT SAILOR
(nods)
Hate those things

They turn back toward the island continue their vigil A
long pause

SHORT SAILOR (CONTD)
Taste all right though

TALL SAILOR
That they do

From behind the two sailors at the rail are well-lit by a
lantern Suddenly shadows appear skeletons climbing up
the sailors backs -MOVE CLOSER and then the skeletons
appear reaching -- the two sailors are grabbed from behind

EXT DAUNTLESS - SIDE - NIGHT

Two bodies are tossed out over the rail hit the water with
a splash

EXT DAUNTLESS - SIDE - NIGHT

Pintel looks down into the water satisfied Puts away his
knife Notices pulls out a long piece of seaweed from his
rib cage Tosses it Turns to the others

PINTEL

Be quick now Train the starboard guns

on the beach and set your aim Wait

for my signal we dont want to spook

them
The pirates hurry to comply -
EXT LAGOON - BLACK PEARL - NIGHT
Elizabeth rounds the point further and sees the Black
Pearl anchored in the neighboring cove A fleck of color -
Cottons parrot as it darts in through a porthole
Elizabeth slows her efforts silently approaching the ship
EXT BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - NIGHT
Four PIRATES -- who really ought to be keeping watch -

instead have gathered wine bottles and rum casts into a
pile along apples biscuits -- all the food on the ship

They act out a mock-feast in anticipation of the curse
being lifted A SKINNY skeleton offers two bottles BIG
BONED

skeleton
SKINNY
Which would you prefer first good
sir -rum or wine
BIG-BONES
I believe Ill have a spot o rum if
you dont mind and thankee kind sir
They burst out laughing -- a hideous sound that wheezes

through their bones

Behind them unnoticed Elizabeth peeks cautiously around a
corner She picks her moment and sneaks past quickly down
a gangway disappearing into the blackness of the ship

EXT ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT

Gillette crouches running low behind a line of rocks He
reports to Norrington

GILLETTE
All the men in place sir Ready to

fire

NORRINGTON
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is
that

Its the sound of cannon fire -- coming from the Dauntless
Cannonballs hit the shore men cry out in anguish

NORRINGTON (CONTD)
Men Take cover

The sailors scramble to find refuge -

INT ISLA DE MUERTA - MAIN CAVERN - NIGHT

Will guarded by pirates glares at Jack
WILL

Youve been planning this from the
beginning Since you learned my name
Jack takes the opportunity to move toward him

JACK
Oh please -- do I really seem that
clever

Before Will can answer Jack smoothly slips the sword from
a Pirates scabbard -- tosses it to Will who catches it
despite his surprise

JACK (CONTD)
Use it well

He draws his own sword -- and clobbers the Pirate Barbossa
and the other pirates stare in shock -

BARBOSSA
Confound it Jack -- I was
actually beginning to like you

Swords are drawn and the Pirates attack

Jack and Will take on multiple opponents each with his own
style Will parries glissades and disarms with lightning
fast and perfect form while Jack uses his blade fists
acrobatics and anything within reach to survive

EXT ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT

The sailors charge The moon emerges from behind a cloud -

Suddenly army of SKELETON PIRATES rise up from the sea and

charge the stunned sailors -- several men are struck down -
NORRINGTON
Steady men Remember -- were the
Navy

The sailors recover their nerve and engage the enemy Its
a full on battle Royal Navy against Skeleton Pirates -

The Navy men are driven back surrounded -

Suddenly there is a massive BOOM of cannon fire
Norrington in the midst of a swordfight tries to see -

NORRINGTON (CONTD)
What is happening out there

EXT LAGOON - NIGHT

Its the Black Pearl manned by Gibbs AnaMaria and Cotton
and captained by Elizabeth coming around the point
cannons blazing

EXT HM S DAUNTLESS - NIGHT

The pirates on the ship are caught by surprise try to turn
their cannons to this new foe -

EXT ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT
Gillette sees the Black Pearl firing on the Dauntless

GILLETTE
Theyre on our side Take heart men

The Royal Navy stand their ground and fight -
INT CAVE - MAIN CHAMBER - NIGHT

Only two pirates left Barbossa and Jacoby Jacoby rounds
on Will Barbossa faces off against Jack

BARBOSSA
Just so you know Jack -- I dont
think youre that clever I think
youre a fool A mortal fool

JACK
Remarkable how often those two
traits coincide

Jack drives him back making Barbossa laugh

BARBOSSA
You cant beat me Jac

To prove his point he drops his own sword -- and catches
Jacks sword with both hands Jack cant free it Barbossa
twists the sword from Jacks grip reverses it -

- - AND DRIVES THE SWORD INTO JACKS CHEST

Will battling Jacoby sees it -- he smashes Jacoby in the
jaw crumpling him

WILL
Jack

Jack stares down at the sword jutting from his chest He
takes a few steps backward toward the Aztec gold -- when
he steps into the moonlight JACK BECOME SKELETAL
JACK
Well isnt that interesting

Skeleton Jack pulls the sword from his chest He pulls
something from his pocket one of the Aztec coins

JACK (CONT D)
Theyre so pretty I just couldnt
resist stealing one Its a curse
I guess

Barbossa grabs up his sword and rushes Jack Both men are
in moonlight now two skeletons in pitched battle

BARBOSSA
So what now Jack Sparrow Are we
to be two immortals locked in
epic battle until the trumpets of
Judgment Day

JACK
Or you could surrender

He shoves Barbossa back out of the moonlight Barbossa
stalks the room his attention focused on Jack

BARBOSSA
Or I could chain you to a
cannonball and drop you in the
deepest part of the ocean where
you can contemplate your folly
forever

Barbossa charges -
A SHOT RINGS OUT -

Jack stands out of the moonlight flesh and blood again
holding his smoking pistol still aimed at Barbossa

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
Hah Ten years you carried that
pistol and you end up wasting
your shot

WILL
He didnt waste it

Will stands over the Aztec chest holding a bloody sword
his left hand in a fist He opens the fist -

-- the medallion blood covering it drops from his hand
revealing the cut in his palm

Barbossa stares then looks down at his chest Blood
blossoms on his shirt around the bullet hole It spreads
quickly

Barbossa clutches his chest his face registering pain for
the first time in years Barbossa falls heavily to the

ground dead

Jack blows the smoke from the barrel of his pistol
tosses it away

EXT ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT
Murtogg FIRES a pistol at a pirate The pirate is hit
screams in pain and crumples to the ground Mullroy runs

through another with his sword

The pirates react to the sight and quickly realize their
peril They set their weapons down in surrender

EXT ISLA DE MUERTA - LAGOON - NIGHT

The Black Pearl comes alongside the Dauntless and Jacks
crew swarm across overwhelming the pirates

The sailors on the beach see it and CHEER
INT ISLA DE MUERTE - CAVE - MAIN CAVERN - NIGHT

Will wraps a cloth around his palm Jack joins him near the
chest

WILL
Well youre the worst pirate Ive ever
heard of
(smiles)

Youre a man who can be trusted who
can be counted on and who can It
betray his friends What kind of pirate

is that
JACK
(admits it)
The worst
(beat)

On the other hand maybe Im a man who
cant pass up a chance for revenge
against the black-hearted bastard who
stole my ship and left me to die in the
middle of the ocean -- twice -- and
who knows how to get what he wants Now
thats a great pirate

Jack cuts his palm grips the coin he stole above the chest
and then hesitates

Will looks at him

Jack releases the coin It lands in the chest beside the
other bloody coin

Suddenly the lid of the chest all on its own SLAMS SHUT
Elizabeth stares at it

WILL
Lets get out of here

EXT ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT - LATER

Jack Will and Norrington gather together on the beach
Elizabeth calls out

ELIZABETH
Youre all right

The three men turn as one An awkward moment -- which of
them does she mean

Elizabeth races across the sand toward them -- and
straight to Will She throws her arms around his neck in a
hug

WILL
Miss Swann -- are you wearing trousers
And how did you get off the island

Elizabeth cant believe thats what he noticed Indignant
she steps away from him

ELIZABETH
Yes I am wearing trousers And as for
how we got off the island -- ah thats

a grand adventure but now is not the
time to talk about it

She reaches a hand behind his neck decisively kisses him
ELIZABETH (CONTD)
There And dont you dare tell me

that wasnt a proper kiss

WILL
Elizabeth I think it doesnt matter-
that we are of a different class -

ELIZABETH
It doesnt

WILL
-- but that was not a proper kiss

Pure consternation on Elizabeths face -

WILL (CONTD)
This is a proper kiss

Will sweeps her in his arms leans her back and kisses her
long and well -

Jack puts a hand on Norringtons shoulder

JACK
Tough luck I was rooting for you

EXT PORT ROYAL - FORT CHARLES - DAY

Close on Wills face stoic staring forward He stands
straight and unmoving Around him are members of the Royal
Navy standing before for a group of witnesses from town

It is the courtyard on the top of Fort Charles A trial is
underway -- with Will as the defendant

NORRINGTON
and though I do say so with
regret the law is clear The
penalty for piracy is death by
hanging

In the crowd Elizabeth squeezes the hand of her father
Swann She lets go as Swann stands

SWANN

By your leave I wish to speak on
behalf of the boy

(a glance at Elizabeth)
It is clear that these deeds were
performed out of a sincere desire to do
good at great personal risk It seems
to me that in the rare occasion where
the right course is committing an act
of piracy then an act of piracy is the
right course

(cheers of approval)
So in my capacity as Governor I intend
to grant a pardon to --

GILLETTE
Sir

All eyes turn Gillette stands at the top of a stairway

GILLETTE (CONTD)
Jack and his crew have escaped
(gasps from the crowd)
There was no damage to the cell
they must have been set free

Will and Elizabeth exchange looks You Not me you No
not me either Swann notices something the parapet points

SWANN
The Black Pearl

People rush to the parapet Sure enough below in the bay
are the distinctive black sails of the Pearl The ship cuts
through the waters very close to the point -

-- where the gallows of the pirates are Suddenly Jack
appears on the point he swings off the one empty
gallows across and down onto the ships rigging as it
passes

GILLETTE
Sir Shall I break out the
cannons

NORRINGTON
I dont think that will be necessary

Norrington raises his hand twirls a key on his finger

NORRINGTON (CONTD)
A days head start Thats all he gets

Will Elizabeth and Swann look out toward ocean-

EXT BLACK PEARL - STERN DECK - DAY

Jack monkeys down the rigging AnaMaria is at the wheel
ANAMARTA

Captain Sparrow -- the Black Pearl
is yours
Jack runs a hand lovingly along the rail then takes the
wheel It feels good -- right -- in his hands He enjoys
it and then shifts to Captain mode

JACK
AnaMaria trim the mainsail

ANAMARTA
Aye aye sir

JACK
Mr Gibbs organize a cleaning detail -
you and Cotton I want every inch of
the Pearl spic-and-span and ship-shape

Gibbs actually stomps the deck executes a salute

Jack stands at the wheel hes got his ship back and all
is right with the world He begins to unconsciously hum
Yo ho yo ho a pirates life for me

He realizes what hes doing and smiles the orchestra takes
over as the Black Pearl sails for uncharted waters and
we FADE UP large words in script

FADE OUT and CREDITS ROLL
