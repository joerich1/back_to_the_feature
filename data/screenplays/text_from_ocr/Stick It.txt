doors to the gym

WITH A BANG and BLAST OF LIGHT the door bursts open as THE
ELITES race into the gym The POV makes Haley’s foot look
like Gullivers surrounded by Lilliputians

JOANNE

vick When can we scrap the old
long-sleeved leotards We need new
ones for Nationals Every college
will be scouting me

(to Haley)
Not that you have to worry about
any of that

HALEY
A new leotard might distract the
ijudges and scouts from your lack of
talent It’s a solid strategy

JOANNE
Gee Pariah Carey Wonder why no
ones scouting you for college
Oh I forgot You don’t matter

Joanne leaves Vick hands Haley a rag and a scraper They
start wiping the chalk bowls and scraping the bars down

HALEY
That she can even say the word
college is an indictment against
the whole institution

dismounts a simple single-tuck with cowboyed legs

Deja jealous Haley Bring back
memories We trained together with
Chris for - how long

HALEY
That’d be too long

JOANNE
And hed give me so much attention
that you couldn’t take it So
rather than deal with it you
decided to take matters into your
own hands didn’t ya

HALEY
You were getting a lot of attention
because you sucked Joanne
STICK IT 2B 02112005 25

JOANNE
If memory serves sucking was your
specialty Bailey Some of us
didn’t need to sleep with the coach
to get attention

DORRIE

words Pointy words are mouth
turds

The ELITES all have their mouths open Haley turns to the
girls

HALEY
Don‘t believe everything you hear
The truth is actually much much
worse
(heading to the beam)
But not as bad as Joannes pre-
school beam routine

Joanne scoffs Dorrie tries to calm Haley

DORRIE
Easy I choreographed that routine

Haley starts jumping around and stretching

HALEY
Your secret‘s safe with me
(adjusting beat board)
Since I‘m so jealous of Joanne I
memorized her routine already

JOANNE
I dont think you’re in shape

HALEY
And I don’t think you can think
I‘m two years out-of-shape and I
can do this in my sleep

Without blinking Haley mounts the beam like Joanne
HALEY
Why do a risky flight mount when
you can get on safely

Haley mimics Joanne‘s safe routine throughout it is the
paragon of lame gymnastics choreography

Then we have some finger-flicking
good choreography

(into butt stick-out)
The classic butt shelf followed by
some choreographic dust bunnies -
useless bits of fluff that get us
from Point A to Point B and induce
the urge to vacuum

Haley launches easily into the moves she describes Joanne
is looking around like is anyone going to do anything

HALEY
Then - the standard D connection
acro series flip flop layout step
out layout step out into some
dance dance revolution a full
turn on one leg and at least one
leap with a 180 degree split

Haley leaps and fake bobbles dramatically covering it

HALEY
That was for you Joanne

Woohoo - punch front wolf jump -

Watch as I set up my unspectacular
dismount it’s the most points I
can get for the least amount of
work so rather than show you what
I can really do - which let’s face
it isnt much - let me phone it

Closed Captioning I’m not mute

Joanne gives Mina a scary “I‘1l kill you” look as Haley
keeps talking on the phone

HALEY
How about a triple back I‘11
probably cowboy my legs apart but
thats what Joanne would do And
after all it is hard to keep my
legs together after sleeping with
our old coach for so long You
understand

Haley hangs up Then she turns the pretend phone into a fake
microphone covering her ear and whispers into it

HALEY
She’s really going to have to stick

Haley “tosses” the fake mic spots the end of the beam and --

ugly blazers trying to do what I
can do

A MIDDLE-AGED FEMALE JUDGE SALUTES on the floor exercise and
begins a routine She‘’s going for it when her pants rip She
stops horrified and tiptoes off covering her rear end

ON BARS ANOTHER JUDGE slaps on some chalk covering her blue
blazer in white dust AN OLDER JUDGE helps her prep the bars
spraying bars with the water sprayer

THE JUDGE SALUTES running to do a springboard mount onto the
UNEVENS She catches her shoe-clad feet on the bottom bar
doing a colossal face plant into the mat

REVERSE ON GYMNASTS calculating and writing down her score

TIGHT ON A MALE JUDGE crying THE CAMERA SPINS revealing the
terrified judge hanging under the balance beam legs and arms
clutching for dear life Letting go he falls out of frame
with a THUD and an OW

ON VAULT A REALLY OLD JUDGE runs down the vault runway
doing a nice round-off entry JUMP CUT and the Judge‘s body
is now a dummy which flies violently off the vault OVER THE
LANDING FOAM and into the BLEACHERS
