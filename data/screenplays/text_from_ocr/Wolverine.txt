THE WOLVERINE

Written by

Christopher McQuarrie
BLACK
And a woman’s voice Soft yet strong

WOMAN’S VOICE (VO)
Before Kofun before Asuka there
was the age of Jomon The darkest
days in a remote island kingdom
Before it was called Japan

A PRIMAL SCREAM takes us to

EXT RAIN-SWEPT RICE PADDY - DAY

Not the Japan you imagined We are in her dark ages
in the midst of a savage tribal war

WARRIORS are draped in primitive animal hides with a
thick outer layer of finely woven grass to shed the
pounding rain Faces are marked with war-paint
Weapons are iron and combat in clumsy with the
battlefield under two feet of water

Casualties are high

VOICE (VO)

There was no Emperor then No
shogun no Samurai Only rival
warrior clans fighting over food
land and religion But two
particular clans their names lost
to history fought only for blood

EXT BAMBOO FOREST - CLEARING - DAY

DIFFERENT CLANS A different kind of battle The
dress is lighter - weapons sophisticated fighting
techniques refined War-paint has given way to
colored sashes One side wears RED the other BLACK

ON ONE SIDE OF THE CLEARING WE FIND THE RED WARLORD
a polished volcanic stone around his neck watching
the merciless fight with cold unblinking eyes

VOICE (VO)
It was a feud so old its reasons
could not be remembered - so bitter
its wounds could never be healed
The only objective revenge

ACROSS THE CLEARING THE BLACK WARLORD a strand of
green pears around his neck calmly looks on
EXT RICE PADDY - DAY
The sky clear the war over Peasants plant rice

VOICE (VO)
Most clans would find an uneasy
peace They flourished and grew
planting the seeds of what would
one day be Japan But for some

EXT OPEN FIELD - NIGHT

The Red and Black clans clash again Flaming arrows
fill the air providing the only light The fighting
is graceful precise perfect

VOICE (VO)
Killing was all they knew And they
refined it to a high art Until
it was clear to all that neither
side would ever defeat the other

EXT BAMBOO FOREST - CLEARING - NIGHT

An ominous orange light Red and Black Warrior
surrounding the cleaning holding torches

VOICE (VO)
Finally the Warlords of the rival
clans met to end the war

The Red and Black Warlords meet in the center of the
clearing speaking in clipped firm tones deep into
the night making no progress

VOICE (VO) (CONT’D)
Both men were wise but neither
could put aside his insatiable
hunger for vengeance They could
see only one path to peace

CLOSE ON A GLOWING IRON ARROW is pulled from a flame and
extended between the Warlords

We cannot understand the Red Warlord but we can see his tone
is firmer now Final He extends a hand The Black Warlord
considers then offers his own hand

VOICE (VO) (CONT’D)
And on this the Warlords swore an
unbreakable oath
The Two Warlords clasp hands around the arrowhead
searing their flesh unflinching

EXT BAMBOO FOREST - CLEARING - NIGHT
As their warriors watch the Warlords strip to the
waist each man taking a sword They circle one
another looking for a weakness Then they charge
Their men watch the fight with cold unblinking eyes
VOICE (VO)

The winner claimed victory in a war

as old as time
The Black Warlord stands into frame a bloody blade
in his hand The Warriors of the Black Clan silently
kneel and bow their heads in salute

VOICE (VO) (CONT’D)
The loser sealed his clan’s fate

The Warriors of the Red Clan simply drop their
torches turn and vanish into the night
EXT RED CLAN VILLAGE - DAY

A secluded mountain hamlet Outside a humble bamboo
hut A RED WARRIOR points a blade at his own belly

VOICE (VO)
The men of the losing clan honored
their oath taking their lives

CLOSE ON The Red Warrior’s face as he drives the
dagger home The slightest flinch Then he falls

VOICE (VO) (CONTD)
And the lives of their families

ANGLE ON the floor of the hut behind him The
motionless bare feet of a woman and two children

EXT BEACH - DAY

The Black Clan rides by the sea to a coastal village

VOICE (VO)
The victors went home uncertain of
a future without war But they

would not be uncertain for long
EXT COASTAL VILLAGE - SUNSET

Huts adorned with whale bone and oyster shells The
Black Warlord rides into frame his stoic face ashen
His eyes burning He dismounts and drops to his
knees One by one his warriors do the same

VOICE (VO)
Their rivals had honored their
oath But not before one last act
of vengeance

Through the door of every hut in the village we see
the bare motionless feet of women and children

EXT COASTAL VILLAGE - NIGHT

A glowing red arrow head One by one each warrior of
the Clan burns the arrow into the flesh of his palm

VOICE (VO)
They were no longer men They no
longer had souls They would never
again walk in the light of day - an
army of vengeance with no enemy
Killers with no feeling Now
they were merely a weapon

AS HIS WARRIORS WATCH the shamed Black Warlord aims
the glowing arrow at his heart and drives it home

VOICE (VO) (CONT’D)
A weapon in search of a master

EXT BAMBOO FOREST - CLEARING - NIGHT

The ominous orange glow The Warriors of the Black
Clan surround the clearing torches in hand

TWO PRIMITIVE WARLORDS wearing animal hide step with
uncertainty into the clearing each holding a dagger

VOICE (VO)
So the two strongest clan lords in
the land were chosen The winner
would be Master of the Black Clan

The surviving Warlord stands into frame The Warriors all
around him silently kneel and bow their heads
VOICE (VO) (CONT’D)
It is said he was this true power
in Japan It is said his will
determined her fate

The Warlord’s uncertain expression changes to one of
eerie clam He considers his new power and smiles

VOICE (VO) (CONT’D)
And all who opposed him Would
meet a swift and shadowy death

EXT BAMBOO FOREST - CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

The ominous orange glow A CHALLENGER steps into the
clearing to face the now Aged Master of the Clan

VOICE (VO)
In time the Clan became an order
the order became belief And the
contest became ritual As old as
Japan itself

CLOSE ON The Challenger stands into frame a bloody
sword in his hand COME AROUND SLOWLY as the Warriors
bow By the time we come around full circle A NEW
CHALLENGER stands in the center of the clearing

HOLD ON THIS as the Challenger morphs over and over
again marking the passing of generations millennia
each man’s clothes becoming more familiar more
modern - inching toward the twentieth century

VOICE (VO) (CONTD)
And the Black Clan as with any
weapon were as good - or as evil -
as the hand wielding it

STOP THE LAST CHALLENGER we will see - his face
hard his eyes hawkish and hateful He wears the
uniform of A JAPANESE ARMY OFFICER circa 1939

VOICE (VO) (CONTD)
-Silencing their master’s
enemies enforcing their master’s
will shaping Japan’s destiny
With cold unblinking eyes

Silence And A BLINDING ORANGE LIGHT
Our eyes adjust gradually making sense of an atomic

blast and the subsequent mushroom cloud a moment
before the deafening shock-wave brings
WHITE
The haunting sound of cold wind Lonely Isolated

AN EAGLE drifts into frame eyes sharp head ticking
left right center left again - then diving We
follow and emerge from the clouds TO REVEAL

A brilliant green mountain valley one thousand feet
below snow-capped peaks on either side We are one
with the eagle adrift on the wind living only for
the hunt We fly lower faster - skimming snow
rocks evergreens A MAN IN WELL-WORN LEATHER

Blink

AND NOW WE’RE WITH THE MAN But he’s only a man for
lack of a better word He barely glances at the eagle
flying past his head the bird wondering how the Man
came to be here Much like the Man himself

The Man squats knuckles in the soil - primal - his
thick black hair framing an unshaven face He is un-
phased by his proximity to a sheer three hundred
foot drop He studies an animal track between his
feet - wider than his two wide hands placed side-by-
side - Five toes long claws The animal is a giant

He stands slowly holding up a shred of brightly-
colored nylon clotted with blood and hair

The Man hears something we can’t smells something we
don’t follows his keen senses toward his quarry We
notice he is strangely equipped for a remote mountain
trek Boots jeans a leather jacket No pack no
heavy weather gear No weapons that we can see

The sound of hard steady wind takes us to

INT CAVE - DAY

Looking out from darkness to the cold gray light of
day - wind howls past the mount of the cave like a
siren a warning The Man’s silhouette approaches

EXT CAVE - DAY

He looks into the blackness - buffeted by the wind
noting claw marks on the cold rocks His sharp eyes
adjust making out the empty sockets of a cleanly
peeled human skull The wind suddenly stops changes
course The Man sniffs turns too late
WHACK - He is struck across the face He lands on his
back across a sharp boulder head bleeding A mass of
claws backed by a gaping mouth filled with teeth
descends He rolls screaming as his dislocated arm
twists The beast slams into the boulder dislodging
it from the gravel bed Then we see the animal whole

A GRIZZLY - fur matted and rank muscle caked with
blood breathing strained other-worldly An arrow
is lodged in the animal’s spine

The bear lunges with surprising speed shoving the
rock as it stands upright - eleven feet fall
howling The rock slides toward the steep drop as

The Man scrambles to his feet dazed - painfully
wrenching his dislocated arm back into its socket
holding his partially detached scalp in place

The ground beneath him gives way and he tumbles down
a steep gravel slope sliding toward a thick fallen
redwood bristling with sharp broken branches The
large boulder tumbles after him

WHAM - The man hits the tree hard inches from being
impaled The boulder skids down the slope behind him -
SHHHHHHHHHHHWHAM - pinning his legs to the tree He
howls in pain cries in vain to lift the tree Then a
new shower of stones behind him The bear is coming

The Grizzly slides down the slope in a hail of rocks
and debris right for the Man’s back He tries to turn
and face the attack but the rock won’t let him

With no other choice The Man arches himself backward
over the rock wrenching his smashed legs sucking up
buckets of pain The world upside down now he

extends his arms as if to embrace the bear And then

SCHICK - Three gleaming ten-inch blades extend from
between the knuckles on both hands In another
universe this would be inexplicable In the world of
Logan of Wolverine this is a day at the office

He braces for the impact of 1000 pounds of screaming
meat Given the circumstances he screams as well

WHITE

A helicopter roars across the sky bearing the
slightly dated rainbow striping of the very dated

ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE
EXT CAVEHILLSIDE - LATER

FIVE YOUNG MOUNTIES slide down the same gravel
hillside to join a SQUARE-JAWED MOUNTIE staring in
muted shock at something 0S As they approach the
Young Mounties can’t hide their looks of horror

YOUNG MOUNTIE
Is is that our man-eater

SQUARE JAW
Judging by the contents of his
stomach

One of the Young Mounties bends out of frame and
heaves Square Jaw sighs shakes his head Rookies

YOUNG MOUNTIE
Wh What the hell did that

2ND MOUNTIE
Whatever it was it was mad

3RD MOUNTIE
Look at how it cut through that
tree-stump

SQUARE JAW
Part beaver you figure
(off their confused looks)
Idiots It was a man

YOUNG MOUNTIE
One man did all this

2ND MOUNTIE
Why’d he cut the tree in half

3RD MOUNTIE
Why’d he cut the bear in half

Square Jaw grabs a radio barks into it

SQUARE JAW
2-6-2 Alpine

VOICE (ON RADIO)
Alpine go

SQUARE JAW
It’s the rogue all-right All
butchered up Send animal control
And the medical examiner Think we
have our missing campers too
VOICE (ON RADIO)
Alpine copy

SQUARE JAW
Then get me a description of that
hunter Chet was telling you about
Ut it on the wire I’d like a word
with him 2-6-2 out

He walks his men follow - past the rock past the
tree hacked in half as if by rabid beavers Drag
marks and hand prints in the dirt tell a story

A man with three blades in each hand pulled himself
toward the nearby river Then signs of these blades
vanish The drag marks stop and foot-prints appear
telling us this man managed to find his feet The
footprints lead into the river The story ends

YOUNG MOUNTIE
What’s this about a hunter Sarge

SQUARE JAW
Last night a fella comes up to the
North Barracks On foot No gear
No gun Smoking a cigar if you can
imagine Heard we had a rogue bear
on our hands Told the dispatcher
it would take us weeks to find it
Said he could track it in a day
Dispatch asks him how he figures on
finding a half-crazed man-eating
bear in the high country all by
himself This character with the
cigar says ‘Cuz I understand it’

And now the Mounties wonder if something worse than a
man-eating bear could be out there

EXT WOODS - DAY

Logan squats hidden by the trees watching the
Mounties across the river He shivers soaking wet
his wounds gone He pulls a three inch long splinter
from his hand dropping it in a pile of several more
The gash it leaves heals before our very eyes

He picks up an arrow with distinctly colored flights
taken from the bear’s spine The tip is a broad-head
with a cruel hollow point dripping amber liquid

Logan turns the arrow over again and smells the
flights Then he stands and walks into the woods

EXT ROAD HOUSE - DUSK

Eighteen wheelers roar through cold rain under an
angry gray sky Logan crosses the highway toward a
battered road house offering beer and bait in neon

He wanders through the mud-clotted pick-up trucks
parked out front breathing deep and slow through his
nose He stops at a truck with deer antlers in the
grill a wolf’s tail on the antenna In back he spies
a bow and a quiver of arrows the flights familiar

INT ROAD HOUSE - NIGHT

French Canadian country music - if you can imagine
such a thing - in a smoky room filled with TRUCKERS
LOGGERS and HUNTERS - forty men al told None small

On the muted TV we see the RCMP around a redwood cut
clean in half a rock and two white sheets The
scroll tells of five missing campers a rogue bear
and how the Mounties shot the animal dead

Logan dirty wet brooding walks along the bar
breathing deep and slow through his nose He pauses
behind one man in particular A DEEP SWIGGING MEATY
CANUCK in a greasy orange hunting cap Logan drops
the arrow on the bar in front of him Pause

MEATY CANUCK
That’s a poison broad-head mister
Theyre illegal

LOGAN
Ask me where I found it

MEATY CANUCK
Don’t care

LOGAN
In a bear Up the back country
Seems whatever fat slop shot that
animal didn’t have the wind or the
skill to track it down proper and
finish it off

The meaty Canuck glances up at the TV

LOGAN (CONTD)
And instead of dropping a lethal
dose this arrow bled poison into
that bear for days Made him crazy
Killed five people
MEATY CANUCK
That’s unfortunate

LOGAN
That’s murder Five counts for
the man who shot that arrow

MEATY CANUCK
(half turning glaring)
And you think that’s my arrow

LOGAN
I know it is And I’m gonna hear
you tell it to the Mounties

Logan puts a hand on the Canuck’s shoulder The
Canuck throws a punch - his hand full of beer-mug

CRUNCH - Logan staggers back covering his face The
Canuck spins ready to fight He freezes Confused

Logan’s hand covers what must be a pretty bad wound
But when he wipes off the blood there’s only a small
cut on his face He rolls tongue n cheek and a piece
of glass pops out The Canuck watches it fall to the
floor When he looks back at Logan the cut is gone

LOGAN (CONT’D)
Let me show you how it works

WHAM - Logan drives his right fist into the Canuck’s
gut He doubles over into Logan’s left fist held
anvil-steady The Canuck collapses jaw broken

LOGAN (CONT’D)
Now heal
(as the Canuck tries to crawl)
Yeah I guess you could read that
two ways What I meant was-

WHACK - A pool cue hits Logan across the back of the
head He merely winces and turns

A BIG LOGGER holding a broken cue like this is a
joke on him Logan sighs calms himself

LOGAN (CONT’D)
Now I don’t want any trouble This
is between me and him not -

EVERY MAN IN THE BAR stands

LOGAN (CONT’D)
-- All of you

A BIGGER LOGGER steps up holding up a baseball bat

BIGGER LOGGER
Let’s see you break thi-

SCHLICK-SMACK - Logan’s claws flash through the bat
In the same motion he punches - his claws retracting
an instant before he connects with the Logger’s jaw

CRUNCH - And we’re off Loggers Truckers and
Hunters fueled by liquid courage rush him in waves
The fight is without grace without choreography A
close-in 40-to-1 head-busting brawl Then 30 20

CLOSE ON A MASSIVE LOGGER by the back door wisely
watching waiting He’s fondling an axe

The last man falls Logan is a bruised and swollen
mess - his ability to heal taxed to its limit He
sees the Massive Logger coming winding up his axe

Logan staggers back arms too spent for defense But
he won’t surrender He lunges with a howl The Logger
side-steps and sticks his foot out Logan trips
dents the edge of the bar with his head and hits the
floor face down The Massive Logger places a foot on
Logan’s back rests the axe on Logan’s neck

MASSIVE LOGGER
Smaller chunks for th’wood-chipper

He raises the axe and

VOICE (0S)
DROP IT

ANGLE ON Square Jaw and his Mounties in the doorway
guns drawn

BLACK

No sound A bright flash Sparks We are looking down
at a vaguely human form submerged in a tank of water -
a liquid casket Red-hot molten metal pours from
behind us into the water An explosion of steam
images strobing like snapshots a fast-moving flip-
book of war and anguish peppered with the presence

of a woman her face hidden by a shadow here long
hair there Her back is to us walking down a
windswept beach Then Logan is holding her in his
arms wailing in anguish at the sky her body limp
Logan opens his eyes He does not gasp or cry out He
simply exhales trembling slightly subtly
betraying his fear of sleep He looks to his left

40 battered and beaten Loggers Truckers and Hunters
are pressed against a wall of steel bars staring at
him in mute fascination PULL BACK TO REVEAL

INT JAIL CELL - NIGHT

Logan is seated alone in a holding cell wearing leg
irons his wrists chained to his waist The men from
the bar are in the adjacent cell Perhaps for Logan’s
safety Perhaps for their own

The last of Logan’s injuries heal slowly but visibly The

Canadians stare in mute fascination

LOGAN
Boo

All 40 tough hardened men flinch and step back
Logan smiles A beat later and the cellblock door
opens Square Jaw enters followed by THREE MOUNTIES
WITH SHOTGUNS aimed at Logan through the bars

SQUARE JAW
You have a visitor

A DIMINUTIVE ASIAN MAN with horn-rimmed glasses walks
onto the cell block He wears a black suit and
carries a plain white envelope He bows This is

ZEN
Mr Logan I presume I am Zen

LOGAN
You certainly appear to be Should
I know you

ZEN
No But I have been following you
for some time Your arrest enabled
me to catch up to you at last I
have arranged for your release
pending a fewformalities

LOGAN
That’s bully What do I owe you

ZEN
I assure you Mr Logan The gain
is entirely yours

Zen steps forward offering the envelope The
Mounties tense - Square Jaw grabs Zen’s arm

SQUARE JAW
Just toss it to him

Zen sighs flicks the envelope through the bars It
lands between Logan’s feet He bends but of course
he can’t reach it with his hands chained to his belt

SCHICK - A single claw stabs the envelope before
retracting and bringing it to Logan The Mounties are
stunned the men in the other cell mutter in awe

LOGGER
You see that I told you

SQUARE JAW
I thought you searched him

MOUNTIE
We strip searched him

The envelope contains a sheet of thin parchment Old paper
from an old typewriter As Logan reads

ZEN
I assure you Sergeant if Mr
Logan was a threat to you or your
men he would not be sitting here
now And you would not be standing

SQUARE JAW
Who- What the hell is he

ZEN
That is precisely what I’ve come
here to help him learn

LOGAN
(re paper)
Where did you get this

ZEN LOGAN
First we must have an WHERE
understand-

Logan lunges claws extending slashing chains like
ribbons Shotguns rack and aim He chooses to stop

ZEN
I can help you Mr Logan But
first you must help me

EXT MOUNTIE BARRACKS - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Logan still reading that paper We get to see it now
PROJECT WOLVERINE

Followed by dense military jargon

Meanwhile Zen and a mix of ASIAN and WESTERN SUITS
shake hands with SQUARE JAW and some MOUNTIE BRASS
Things seem to have been worked out They disburse

Zen walks over to Logan He produces a cigar which
Logan accepts As Zen lights it for him

ZEN
Your hunter confessed The police
admit they might never have found
him on their own They are very
grateful

Logan looks past Zen to the Mountie Brass looking this way
with suspicion and disdain

ZEN (CONTD)
Begrudgingly so I admit But they
have dropped all charges With
the understanding that you leave
Canada and never return

Logan nods stung but used to it Waving the paper

LOGAN
Is there more

ZEN
All there is to know Who you are
Where you come from What was done
to you and why But I can only tell
you what little my master permitted
me to read The rest is in Japan

LOGAN
Japa- Did you say your master

ZEN
He is in Tokyo A plane is waiting
to take us to him now

LOGAN
(laughingturning to leave)
Listen It’s been great Thanks for
bailing me out Maybe I’11
see’ya’round
ZEN
We had an agreement

LOGAN
You had an agreement

ZEN
They will arrest you if you stay in
Canada

That stops Logan in his tracks

ZEN (CONTD)
And you will have to comply Or
kill to maintain your so-called
freedom You will continue
searching in the wrong place for
answers to the wrong questions -
wasting your gifts on petty acts of
justice A vigilante living out
your days like that bear - a hunted
rogue Like that hunter - an
ignorant criminal And you will
never find an end to your pain

LOGAN
(turning backglaring)
What do you know about pain

ZEN
I stand in the presence of
History’s Warriors Witness to
centuries of combat ages of
suffering - pursued by enemies he
cannot name grieving for a love he
cannot remember You are the living
Prometheus Compared to youI’ve
never even felt pain

Logans face tells us Zen is pretty close

ZEN (CONTD)
But I know the answers you seek are
not here And while your body heals
quickly your mind never will Not
until you recover your memories and
confront them Only then will you
find peace A peace I can give you

LOGAN
And what do I have to do for you

ZEN
Let me take you to my master
LOGAN
In Japan

ZEN
In Japan

Logan sucks on his cigar considering this with no
small amount of suspicion then he steals a glance at
the glaring Mounties across the way He shrugs

LOGAN
Fine Take me to your leader

ZEN
Master

LOGAN
Whatever

AN EXPLOSION OF SOUND a stream of blue flame

EXT SKIES OVER THE PACIFIC - DAWN

And a sleek private jet streaks eastward away from
the rising sun over a dark and uncertain sea

EXT TOKYO - NIGHT

Another explosion - this time one of unearthly color
blinding light Our eyes adjust to a world of
flashing neon and LED on buildings billboards even
many of the vehicles themselves - this place is one
giant ever changing video screen The streets are
packed with a steady flow of fast-moving foot
traffic seemingly immune to the overload of
surrounding imagery Everything shines Everything is
impossibly clean And everything wants you

Welcome to Tokyo

INT LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

ANGLE ON THE REARVIEW MIRROR and a woman’s cat-like
eyes glancing at Logan from under a chauffeur’s cap
concealing close-cropped hair

This is YUKIO - 26 More on her later
Logan and Zen ride in back As the mind-blowing light

of the city rolls slowly past the TOWERING FACE OF
KINDLY OLD MAN becomes ubiquitous God-like

Whoever he is he is part of the current media cycle
Keener eyes will note a faint scar on his cheek

ZEN
Yashida-Sama My master

LOGAN
He’s big in Japan

His smile fades realizing the joke is lost on Zen

ZEN
Yashida’s family line is as long as
the Emperor’s He has given away
more than Japan’s richest man has
earned His corporation has
revolutionized medical research
agriculture education His wisdom
has shaped our government The
master is Japan

LOGAN
When do I meet him

ZEN
You will see him tomorrow First
you must

INT PALATIAL HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

Zen and TWO BREATHTAKING HOSTESSES escort Logan into
a magnificent penthouse suite overlooking all of
Tokyo - room after room appointed in a careful mix of
elegant tradition and ultra modern In a city where
space is precious it is paradise

Yukio stands in the hallway her back to us looking
sharp and in a black two-piece suit

The 100 inch TV is on no sound - so hi-def it makes
reality look grainy Old Man Yashida is still on the
news A restrospective montage photos with world
leaders going back to JFK Also humanitarian efforts -
water medicine food for the Third World The scroll
is in Japanese thus impossible to read

Logan ignores this scanning the surroundings moving
to the mini (actually quite maxi) bar and choosing
one of ten different kinds of whiskey

LOGAN
This’1l do

ZEN
I live close by and am at your
service day and night

Zen hands him a business card Logan shoves it in his
pocket Zen stares

LOGAN
What

ZEN
It is customary to read the card

LOGAN
Nicefont

ZEN
If there is nothing else you
require

Zen subtly gestures to the Hostesses They bow and
smile They’d like to stay

LOGAN
Gnight

An impressed Zen and the clearly disappointed
Hostesses bow deeply backing out of the room

CLOSE ON Yukio in the hallway stealing a glance at
Logan as the door closes For the first time we see
her face and realize YUKIO IS MORE WESTERN THAN
ASIAN Perhaps hardly Asian at all

Logan closes the door bolts it chains it He takes
off his jacket ours himself a shot stars at the
view Then he notices a low table in the center of
the room and he sole object resting on it

A SAMURAI SWORD - very old by the looks He admires
the weapon picking it up carefully exposing the
razor-sharp blade He merely touches it and his
fingertip bleeds then instantly heals of course

He notices a chain of Japanese characters engraved in
the steel One of them appears to have age-old dried
blood in the grooves His face suddenly changes

FLASH

AND THE SOUND OF GUNFIRE TAKES US TO

EXT JUNGLE - DAY

Logan’s repressed memory Somewhere in the Pacific of
WWII amidst A HANDFUL OF RETREATING CANADIAN
SOLDIERS engaged in a running gun-battle vastly
outnumbered by the pursuing JAPANESE We find

Logan machine-gun in hand WOUNDED SOLDIER over his
shoulder While Logan runs and reloads the Wounded
Soldier shoots and vice versa Until

A grenade blasts Logan off his feet He leads ina
heap his partner dead The dense foliage around him
shreds in a hail of bullets The last of his squad
now Logan runs as far and as fast as he can until

CRASH - The ground under his feet vanishes and he
plummets landing with a sickening crunch

CLOSE ON Logan’s face twisted in a silent howl of
unimaginable pain PULL BACK TO REVEAL

He has fallen face down into a man-trap filled with
dozens of bamboo spears impaled like an insect
spikes through his out-stretched limbs his abdomen
his shoulder He is completely immobilized - unable
to free himself His claws extend unconsciously and
we notice they are raw bone - not metal Useless

He can hear the enemy in the distance searching He
struggles to pull himself free adding to his pain

Then a SHADOW looms over him A YOUNG JAPANESE
SOLDIER - handsome with dark piercing eyes - rifle
in hand After inspecting Logan’s predicament the
Soldier drops his rifle and draws a sword He rests
the edge of the sharp blade on the back of Logan’s
neck nicking the flesh slightly He raises the blade
high Logan braces for the end

CLOSE ON The cut on Logan’s neck healing

CLOSE ON The Soldier’s eyes widening

The Soldier lowers the blade cuts Logan’s cheek and
watches it heal A drop of blood runs from Logan’s
cheek onto the engraved steel - unmistakably the same
blade he will hold in a Tokyo hotel room 70 years
hence The Soldier raises the sword and strikes

WHACK - he hacks the bamboo pinning Logan’s right
arm Then he drops the sword in the pit

Confused but grateful Logan grabs the blade as
The Soldier walks a few yards from the pit listening
with a mixture of fear and fascination to the sound
of Logan painstakingly cutting himself free The
Soldier slowly draws a secondary short sword from his
belt waiting to face this unique enemy Then

Logan leaps cat-like out of the pit sword in hand
pulling the last piece of bamboo from his shoulder
the rest of his wounds already healed

The Soldier shouts in Japanese demonstrating with
his short sword how Logan should defend himself

Uncertain Logan raises his sword and

CLANKCLANGSMACK - The Soldier charges hits Logan’s
blade slaps him with the flat side of his sword and
is back in place before Logan can blink We can’t
understand his words but the Soldier’s attitude says
it plain “No no No Do it like this”

CLANKCLANGSMACK - He does it again smiling this
time Now Logan is mad He raises the sword ready

CLANKCLANGSMACK - Logan blocks the last strike
simultaneously extending his bony claws - tearing the
Young Soldier’s cheek The soldier staggers back
stunned watching as Logan’s claws retract swallowed
by the rapidly healing skin around his knuckles

THE SOUND OF GUNFIRE turns their heads In the
distance JAPANESE SOLDIERS are the ones running now
chased by A WAVE OF BRITISH SOLDIERS

The Soldier knows he’s doomed He drops to his knees
bows his head and waits for Logan to finish him

But Logan offers the sword handle-first The Soldier
is surprised yet again by Logan He takes the sword
as he stands Logan nods to him “Go That way” But
the Soldier is torn Ready to fight impossible odds
Logan puts a hand on his shoulder - his eyes
desperate for the boy “Go”

The Soldier nods and runs to fight another day

INT PALATIAL HOTEL SUITE - DAY

LOGAN
The hellizzah-

Logan wakes from a deep sleep on the sofa rain
beating the windows The sword is back in its stand

The door opens behind him He inhales

LOGAN (CONTD)
Good morning Zen

ZEN
I trust that you slept well

Logan sits up sees the Old Man on the TV again
looking at him differently now

LOGAN
I’ve met your master before
haven’t I

Zen steals a glance at the sword and nods
ZEN
Your encounter left a deep
impression He spent a considerable
portion of his wealth to discover
all he could about you

LOGAN
What does he want with me Why now

The question seems to strike a nerve with Zen

ZEN
I will take you to him

Logan stands and a small object drops from the collar
of his shirt bouncing three times on the table
before plunking softly on the carpet

EXTREME CLOSE UP ON An iridescent gray-green pearl
Zen picks it up with his thumb and forefinger

LOGAN
What is that

ZEN
It isn’t yours

Logan shakes his head “No” Zen’s blood runs cold

ZEN (CONTD)
Did you leave your room last night

LOGAN
Never left the couch Can we go
now I’d like to meet the old man

Logan heads for the door opens it waits

ZEN
Mr Logan Unless you have
another explanation as to how this
came to be in this-

LOGAN
The last lady who stayed here lost
an earring Let’s go

ZEN
Or someone placed it on your person
while you slept

LOGAN
(scoffing)
My person Without waking me Me
Who would do that Who even could

We suspect Zen might know the answer to that For whatever
reason he’s not sure to answer Then

ZEN
«- Mr Logan

LOGAN
Zen Enough with the oyster
droppings Take me to your leader

Zen sighs walks through the door

ZEN
Master

LOGAN
What you said

Logan walks out shutting the door We remain
focusing on the chain We distinctly recall Logan
putting it on We don’t remember him taking it off
INT LIMOUSINE - DAY

Logan and Zen in back the mysterious Yukio driving
a dreary rain spattering the windshield

EXT TOKYO STREET - DAY

Logan and Zen emerge from the limo into a crowd of
SOMBER JAPANESE MEN AND WOMEN and black umbrellas

As the only Westerner (wearing denim and leather no
less) Logan’s presence is off-putting But the too-
polite attendees steal glances rather than stare

ANGLE ON THE LIMO across the street Yukio’s comely
eyes follow Logan until she is distracted by

An argument at the front door between THE DOORMAN and
A YOUNG MAN trying to push his way inside The crowd
tries their best to pretend he is not there

Logan stares The kid is a dead ringer for the Young
Soldier he fought in the jungle

The Doorman shoves the Young Man down in the gutter
humiliated He gets up and storms off in a rage

This is KENUICHIO Remember him

INT AUDITORIUM - DAY

People remove coats to reveal MEN IN DARK SUITS
WOMEN IN TRADITIONAL JAPANESE GARB Logan finds
himself in a room filled with rows of seats facing a
stage draped in red velvet He is on a receiving line
at some high occasion for a very select group The
crowd parts behind Logan and Zen

People bow deeply to A PORTLY BESPECTACLED MIDDLE-
AGED MAN and his TEAM OF BODYGUARDS

He is accompanied by his CAUCASIAN SECRETARY -
attractive business suit - long raven-black hair
hiding one side of her face and glasses that subtly
stir fantasies of the naughty school-marm variety

ZEN
(whispering)
Bow I said Bow

Logan doesn’t The Portly Man gives him the once over
as he passes Logan does it right back then winks at
the Secretary She blanks him Zen is mortified

ZEN (CONTD)
That man is Noburo Mori Minister
of Justice

LOGAN
Good for him

Noburo barges to the front of the line and bows to
the only soul here more impressive than himself
A STANTLEY MAN in his 50s - his bald head gleaming
his pale gray suit almost pearlescent He is

ZEN
Lord Shingen My master’s son We
will pay our respects

On that stage Logan spies a porcelain urn and a
portrait of the Old Man with a black sash across it
Logan notes the staunch expression on the men a
woman quietly sobbing and it hits him

LOGAN
Your master is dead

ZEN
I never said he wasn’t

LOGAN
You could’a said he was

ZEN
I have followed my master’s
instructions explicitly If there
was a deception it was his
intention not mine

LOGAN
If he’s dad what the hell am I
doing here

Shingen bows to Noburo stepping aside to REVEAL

A YOUNG WOMAN The woman A beauty cut from marble
The sort you can’t touch - but have to touch - and
will never ever get close enough to touch

This is MARIKO

The very sight of her hits Logan like lightning
Noburo and Mariko exchange a formal greeting Mariko
bows missing the slightly leering look Noburo gives
her But Shingen catches him There is a tense

dynamic at play here that will reveal itself in time

(Note Take a moment Look over the faces on the
previous few pages Youve met everyone who matters)

As Zen and Logan move closer to the head of the line
ZEN

I am instructed to tell you one
last thing

Logan snaps out of his Mariko-induced trance

LOGAN
Last thing

ZEN
You are free to leave at any time
But the knowledge you seek will
only be yours when you honor the
gift you have been given

LOGAN
Honor the- What does that even mean-

But he is cut off when they come face-to-face with
Shingen Zen leans in speaks softly in Japanese As
he does Shingen’s eyes shift suddenly to Logan

To the mute of shock of everyone Shingen bows deeply
showing great respect This leaves Logan eye-to-eye
with Mariko What follows is one of those subtle yet
unmistakable moments between two people instantly
mutually attracted - both unsure of what to do

Shingen straightens obscuring Mariko and shaking
Logan’s hand

ZEN
Mr Logan Lord Shingen

SHINGEN
I understand you knew my father

LOGAN
In a manner of speaking I’m
very sorry for your loss

SHINGEN
He was a great man He will be
missed
(pushing away his grief)
Excuse my poor manners My
daughter Mariko

Shingen steps aside Mariko bows gracefully - polite
but not submissive As Logan stares at her

SHINGEN (CONTD)
Youll forgive me for saying so
but my father never once spoke
about you When you were mentioned
so reverently in his will we were
obviously intrigued How did you
come to know him

Logan hesitates

SHINGEN (CONTD)
It is an awkward question

LOGAN
An awkward answer

SHINGEN
(smiling warmly)
My father and his mysteries
Perhaps after the ceremony you will
be my guest at my home There you
can share as much or as little as
you like I promise not to pry

Logan glances at Zen Zen nods “Say yes”

LOGAN
I would be honored

SHINGEN
The honor is mine I hope you will
excuse me until then

Logan nods steps aside with one last look to Mariko
As Zen and Logan walk toward the back of the line

LOGAN
What can you tell me about Mariko

ZEN
She is to be married in three days

Beat Logan is stunned

LOGAN
Married

ZEN
To Noburo

Logan turns to look at the portly high-and-mighty
Minister of Justice

LOGAN
That guy She’s marrying that guy

ZEN
The marriage was arranged by her
father It will be a merging of two
great houses A powerful dynasty

LOGAN
What does she have to say about it

ZEN
She has a duty to her family She
will honor her father’s wishes

LOGAN
(reassessing Shingen)
And I was just starting to like the
guy

Just then A MAN WITH A PITTED FACE reaches the head
of the receiving line Shingen does not recognize him
but remains cordial Pit-Face bows deeply - a bit
mocking Then he lashes out with a tanto knife

Shingen is surprisingly fast deflecting the blade
taking a slash to his forearm instead of his throat
A WOMAN IN THE CROWD SCREAMS igniting chaos as

Logan leaps reacting on pure instinct as

Shingen drives his good hand into Pit-Face’s throat
crushing his windpipe as

SEVEN MORE THUGS rise up from the crowd brandishing
knives They rush Shingen BYSTANDERS PANIC getting
in their way Shingen calmly stands his ground
covering Mariko as the FIRST THUG reaches him As

Logan vaults over two rows of seats and crushes the
First Thug’s head under his heals landing face-to-
face with Shingen The two men have an instant to

make eye contact They share a nod and turn to face
the approach of six more knife-wielding thugs But

SCHINCK - Logan has six blades of his own

MARTIKO
Kuzuri

Logan glances at a stunned Mariko staring at his
claws fascinated Terrified Shingen looks at Logan
with more than a few questions of his own

They have to wait The Thugs attack Shingen and
Logan meet them head-on

Despite the use of only one arm Shingen holds his
own dodging slashing blades and striking one-handed
Shingen is a master fighting with dignity and honor
Logan on the other hand kicks slashes brawls and
cheats Anything to win Meanwhile

Noburo’s bodyguards draw weapons but the cavalry is
not coming They whisk Noburo and his Secretary to
the exit Logan sees this more annoyed than angry

CLOSE ON Noburo’s secretary She practically has to
be dragged out lingering to study Logan and his
claws with fascination Remember this

AN EIGHTH THUG comes up behind Shingen Zen leaps in
the Thug’s way despite having no weapon The Thug
sends him back with a single punch and then

MARIKO STEPS IN FRONT OF HIM The Thug stops thrown
for a beat unsure of how to handle her Then he
grins changing his grip in the knife Ready to kill

Slap - Mariko BELTS HIM ACROSS THE FACE stunning him

She raises her chin fearless
The Thug’s grin is gone He swings his blade

THUNK - Logan drives three claws clean through the
Thug’s forearm punching him off with his other fist
turning to take on another attacker when

Yukio steps in his path stopping him

YUKIO
I have Shingen Protect Mariko
(when Logan hesitates)
GO

Yukio draws a knife and follows Shingen into the
fray breaking knees and kicking asses Logan grabs
Mariko’s hand spies the exit and goes To his
surprise this door flies open to REVEAL

ANOTHER THUG - aiming a gun and pulling the trigger
Logan leaps in front of Mariko and TOWARD the Gunman
slamming the door just as the gun goes off

BA-CLANKCLANKCLANK - the steel door sports three
shiny bullet-induced dents in front of Logan’s face
EXT ALLEY - OTHER SIDE OF STEEL DOOR - DAY

The Gunman kicks the door trying to open it He

bashes his shoulder into the door once twice
backing up and rushing for a third when

Six razor-sharp adamantium claws rupture the door
pointing straight out The Gunman can’t stop

INT AUDITORIUM - DAY
CLOSE ON Logan knuckles pressed to the steel door

WHAM - something hits the other side of the door
hard Then silence His claws retract and he opens
the door grabbing Mariko and stepping over what we
assume is the Gunman lying out of frame

EXT ALLEY - DAY

The rain is pouring now Up the alley Logan sees the
limos at the front of the building and SEVERAL POLICE
CARS ARRIVING He leads Mariko that way until

GUNFIRE GUNMEN emerge from PARKED CARS and engage
the police The street is suddenly a wild-west show
Logan turns pulling Mariko the other way when

SCHLING-SLICE - Logan recoils the front of his shirt
cut open a slash down his chest healing in front of
Mariko’s stunned eyes Logan pushes her back as

A gleaming steel blade four feet long swings for his

head He ducks and rolls as the blade chops time and

again gashing concrete like it were clay The blade

hits a dumpster and wedges in the thick steel giving
Logan time to take in a chilling sight

A FIGURE IN GLEAMING ARMOR - derived from the ancient
Japanese noble warriors chest emblazoned with a red
sun He rips the blade from the dumpster and turns
His face is hidden by his gilded helmet - black
shadows for eyes His sword hums raindrops sheeting
off the crackling cushion of distorted air around it

Logan extends his claws and prepares to take his first
piece out of SILVER SAMURAI

The Samurai is pretty sure it will go the other way
In one fluid motion he swings his charged sword
slicing the steel door and tearing a gash through the
brick wall in an arch that ends at Logan’s neck

CHING - The Samurai is surprised to see his sword
stopped so decisively by six adamantium claws Logan
is just as surprised to see the Samurai’s blade
doesn’t break Instead it throws off blue arches of
energy between Logan’s claws blistering his flesh

Logan screams and shoves the blade back attacking
But the Samurai is fast calm almost prescient
Where Logan slashes the blade is there to meet him
The few times he hits armor his claws encounter the
same barrier of energy raking across harmlessly

Samurai raises his blade This is going to hurt

CLOSE ON LOGAN’S RIGHT FIST Two of his three claws
retract

SCHUNK - Then an unholy scream of agony and rage

CLOSE ON LOGAN’S RIGHT FIST a single claw driven
neatly between two plates of armor in the Samurai’s
side the energized metal scalding Logan’s hand

The Samurai kicks Logan back momentarily slowed by
the wound to his side Logan lands hard pushing
himself up noticing his hands are planted on

A MAN-HOLE COVER
He considers his options the vulnerable Mariko

SCHING-SLAM - Logan jams his claws into the man-hole
cover and yanks it out slinging the sixty-pound slab
of steel Samurai sees it coming hacks it in half
One piece goes wide but the other one hits him
square in the forehead knocking him flat

Logan moves Mariko to the man-hole where a ladder
leads down into darkness She hesitates But when
Samurai sits up and finds his sword she scrambles
down the ladder Logan turns as Samurai charges
blade high - ready to cut Logan in half

Logan calmly steps back and drops like a stone

INT DRAIN-TUNNEL - DAY

Logan lands in a torrent of knee-deep rushing water
Mariko clings to the other side of the ladder her
heavy gown pulling her under Logan expertly slashes
sending all but Mariko’s essentials downstream

Samurai looms over the man-hole above His armor
gives him too much bulk to come down He hacks at
the man-hole making it larger

Logan takes Mariko by the arm salutes Samurai and
lets go of the ladder Together they are swept away

EXT ALLEY - DAY

Samurai continues to carve up the pavement until A
LONE COP at the end of the alley points and yells
Samurai sees him and freezes

The Lone Cop looks away long enough to call OTHER
OFFICERS over When he turns back Samurai is gone

INT DRAIN-TUNNEL - DAY

Logan catches another ladder with one hand holding
Mariko with the other They climb emerging into

INT BOILER ROOM - DAY

A giant heating system hums Logan’s claws pierce a
man-hole cover and shove it aside He climbs out
pulls Mariko up and then collapses exhausted

Mariko kneels over him his wounds miraculously
washed away Their eyes meet Mariko kisses him -
gentle but lingering - a little more than thank you

LOGAN
Have we met before

MARTIKO
I think I would have remembered

LOGAN
Don’t be too sure
(standing sore)
‘Should get you someplace safe

He heads for the door and opens it to

Sirens walking POLICE EVERYWHERE Chaos He shuts
the door quickly looking around

MARIKO
I’m safe with you

She stares at him her eyes hypnotic

LOGAN
In case you hadn’t noticed lady
I’m barely holding my own
(she keeps staring)
And whatever kind of trouble youre
in I’m worse
MARTIKO
Youre the trouble I choose

LOGAN
Aren’t you getting married

MARIKO
Eventually

Logan looks toward a staircase on the far side of the
room leading up He sighs

LOGAN
This way then

And he reads her up the stairs

EXT AUDITORIUM - DAY

Chaos and confusion as the police cordon off the
area In the rain-soaked crowd we find Zen and Yukio
escorting Shingen to an ambulance

SHINGEN
(in Japanese)
Where is my daughter

ZEN
We’ll find her Sama First we need to
tend to that arm

They reach the ambulance and Shingen steps in back
MEDICS swiftly slice off his jacket and shirt
revealing a surprisingly ripped frame for his age

LOW ANGLE LOOKING UP as Zen goes to shut the door
SHINGEN
Find Mariko do you hear me

Nothing else matters

ZEN
I will search high and low Sama

He is unaware that BEHIND HIM AND HIGH UP Logan and
Mariko make their getaway along the rooftop

Shingen slumps back into the ambulance The medics go
to work as Zen and Yukio shut the doors and stand
guard ACROSS THE STREET THEY SEE

Justice Minister Noburo talking to a MOB OF PRESS

NOBURO
- but my staff reacted swiftly
and the would-be assassins were
pacified I credit the fine men of
the Tokyo Police for putting down
the second wave of the attack

REPORTER
Witnesses say Lord Shingen was the
target of the attack and not you
Do you have any idea why someone
would want to kill Lord Shingen

NOBURO
This brazen and cowardly act
happened just days after I proposed
a crackdown on organized crime-

REPORTER
Are you saying this is the work of
the Yakuza

NOBURO
(stepping away)
I am saying this brazen and
cowardly act happened just days
after I proposed a crackdown on
organized crime Draw your own
conclusions No more questions

Noburo his Bodyguards and his knock-out Secretary
pile into two waiting limos amid a flurry of shouted
questions that will remain unanswered Just before he
gets in the car Noburo looks ACROSS THE STREET TO

Shingen emerging from the ambulance his wounds
hidden under a new suit The Reporters rush to get
his statement As Noburo gets in his limo Shingen
steals a look at Noburo’s back smart enough to know
he was being watched smart enough not to let on

EXT HOTEL - BALCONY - DAY

LOOKING DOWN FROM A DIZZYING HEIGHT as Logan drops to
the top floor balcony and forces the door with a
single claw He looks up at us and extends his arms

ANGLE ON Mariko seated on the edge of the rooftop
The balcony is a short drop - no more than twenty
feet But to miss it is a fall of several hundred

Without hesitating she drops Logan catches her She
wraps her arms around his neck holds him tightly

INT LOGAN’S PALATIAL HOTEL SUITE - BATHROOM - LATER

The opulence of the suite provided by Zen stands in stark
contrast to the wet bedraggled occupants entering Logan
carries Mariko across the threshold

Mariko is chilled to the bone Logan rushes into the shower
clothes and all turning the water on full He tries to put
her down but she clings to him staring into his eyes He
moves to speak and she puts a hand on his mouth She doesn’t
want to talk

When he tires to talk anyway she kisses him Then the
gentleman gives way to the animal

INT PALATIAL HOTEL SUITE - BATHROOM - LATER

A trail of wet clothes leads from the shower to-

INT PALATIAL HOTEL SUITE - BEDROOM - NIGHTDAY

-the bed where Mariko sleeps peacefully

Logan stands over her wounded look on his face put there by
deep suffering in his forgotten past AN anguish without a

name DISSOLVE AS

The sun rises Logan has hardly moved Mariko stirs looks
around about to ask “did we”

LOGAN
You were asleep before you were out
of the shower

She is at once relieved and disappointed

MARIKO
How long have you been-

LOGAN
All night

Pause Logan stares at Mariko

MARIKO
The way you look at me

LOGAN
What about it
MARIKO
I remind you of someone you used to
know

LOGAN

No Someone I used to be
She studies him for a moment

MARIKO
Why are you here In Japan

LOGAN
Are you really going to marry him

This catches her off guard She recovers Nods

LOGAN (CONTD)
Just like that

MARIKO
It is my duty I accept that

LOGAN
But is it what you want

MARIKO
What I want doesn’t matter I serve
something greater

LOGAN
The House of Yashida

MARIKO
You understand

LOGAN
Not really

MARIKO
-- You should sleep

LOGAN
I gave it up

She smiles doesnt buy it After a beat

MARIKO
Come

She moves over in the bed making room for him Logan
hesitates but her eyes insist He sits on the bed
unsure Mariko gently pushes him back on the pillow

She touches his cheek tracing a finger gently across
his lips his eyebrows

MARIKO (CONTD)
Close your eyes
(as he does)
When I was a little girl I had
terrible nightmares My father
would say go back to sleep Face
your fears

LOGAN
There’s a few fears I’d like him to
meet

MARTIKO

(ignoring this)
My grandfather was different

LOGAN
Tell me about your grandfather

MARTIKO
You knew him

LOGAN
We only met briefly

MARTIKO
Another time Where was I

LOGAN
Your father said ‘face your fears’

MARIKO
Ah yes He did But my grandfather
would tell me stories about Kuzuri
A fierce and terrible creature that
would do whatever I commanded He
would protect me from my fears

LOGAN
Kuzuri

MARIKO
Mmm-hmmm Half-man half-beast - a
heart filled with rage And
six long claws

He opens his eyes She nods “You heard right”

LOGAN
Did the nightmares stop

MARIKO
Yes But even as a little girl I
never believed he was real
She touches his eyes closing them gently

MARIKO (CONTD)

So now Kuzuri Do as I say
Close your eyes And let me watch
over you

She kisses him once twice a third time Logan beings to
respond but then

MARIKO (CONTD)
Now sleep

He closes his eyes and exhaustion takes over as

MARIKO (CONTD)
He needs help Zen

INT PALACIAL HOTEL SUITE LIVING ROOM - LATER

Mariko whispers into the phone Logan sleeps fitfully
in the next room tortured by his nightmares

ZEN (ON PHONE)
That does not mean you have to-

MARIKO
He saved my life I am in his debt

Long silence Zen sighs

ZEN (ON PHONE)
What do you want me to do

MARKIO
You came here looking for me You
did not find me
(when there is no reply)
Say it On your word

ZEN (ON PHONE)
I came there looking for you I did
not find you You have my word

MARKIO
I will be home in a few days

She hangs up before Zen can say another word and
walks back into the bedroom to be with Logan
CLOSE ON Logan as he closes his eyes as the warm
pink light of sunrise on his face gives way to the
bright light of day the tangerine of sunset and the
pale blue of night His eyes open with a start

PULL BACK TO REVEAL Darkness outside and a full-moon
over Tokyo Logan is alone a rhythmic tapping 0OS

INT PALATIAL HOTEL SUITE - LIVINGROOM- NIGHT

Candle-light a warm fire Logan comes out of the
bedroom to find the table set for two Mariko is in
the kitchen putting the finishing touches on dinner

MARIKO
Sit

She brings him something more akin to art than
dinner

MARIKO (CONTD)
Eat

And he does

CLOSE ON The dinner table as the moonlight fades to
pale blue giving way to sunrise again The dinner
plates are gone replaced by breakfast

The sun rises and sets two more times as Logan and
Mariko live a stolen ordinary life

Standing in front of the massive bay window
overlooking Tokyo Mariko teaches Logan the slower
more graceful forms of Aikido - a discipline for
which he has no patience Balancing on one foot he
manges to fall more than once but in time he and
Mariko move in perfect unison Combat becomes
meditation and - in their case - a dance

She also teaches Logan how to cook with an emphasis
on cutting tools Every meal is an unconscious lesson
in perfecting the use of edged weapons Logan’s claws
are offered to help and summarily rejected

Logan is a disaster with chop-sticks determined to
eat with his fingers Mariko slaps the back of his
hands any time he even tries He uses his claws like
skewers to stab his food and Mariko surrenders

INT PALATIAL SUITE - BEDROOM NIGHT

Each night she lays him down talking softly in his
ear holding his hand or rubbing his shoulders - then
watching over him while he sleeps fitfully touching
him reassuringly at the slightest sound of distress

And each night he sleeps a little easier

INT PALATIAL SUITE - BEDROOM - LATER

Mariko is picking up his clothes when something drops
from his pocket and plunks on the carpet She picks
the object up her expression darkening

INT PALATIAL SUITE - BEDROOM - DAWN

CLOSE ON Logan’s eyes rolling behind his eyelids in
REM sleep He wakes not with a start but a mere
flinch happy to find Mariko watching over him

MARIKO
Another nightmare

LOGAN
No A dream

He smiles She doesn’t She holds out her palm
revealing the green pearl There is fear in her eyes

MARIKO
Where did you get this

LOGAN
What is it with that thing

Mariko signs and sits on the edge of the bed Beat

MARIKO
Before Kofun before Asuka there was the
age of Jomon The darkest days of a
remote island kingdom Before it was called
Japan

EXT YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - DAY

Est The ancestral home of the Yashida family high
in the hills overlooking the Port City of Agarashima

High-walled sparsely-lit garden pavilions elegant
understated buildings sprawling gardens a placid
pond An oasis A fortress A home in mourning

INT YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - SHINGEN’S OFFICE - DAY

CLOSE ON Two ancient magnificently ornate swords
The symbols of a venerated family empire They are
behind Shingen seated at his desk his collar open
hands to his temple a bandage on his forearm He is
surrounded by ADVISORS and STAFF all in dark suits

ADVISOR
We have done what we can to control the
press but word is quickly spreading
that you personally fought off the
attackers

Shingen looks up at him as if to say “So”

ADVISOR (CONTD)
You have honored the family name Sama

SHINGEN
Where is my daughter

All of the Advisors shift uncomfortably

ADVISOR
The police have every available man
looking for Mariko and they are
interrogating the assassin who survived
But

SHINGEN

But

ADVISOR
He is not a kidnapper Sama He is an
assassin

SHINGEN
What about this other man The gai-jin
with the

At a loss for words he holds up three fingers on
each hand No one speaks up

SHINGEN (CONTD)
No one here can tell me anything about
him
ADVISOR
We have only your remarkable
description Sama

SHINGEN
Bring me my father’s will And
find Zen

MARIKO (PRE-LAP)
I think you have been marked

INT PALATIAL SUITE - LIVINGROOM- DAY
Mariko pours tea as Logan studies the green pearl

LOGAN
Marked

MARIKO
By the Black Clan
(as Logan scoffs)
It is said they do not eat or sleep
until they’ve killed their intended
victim But first they send a
warning A single sea-green pearl

LOGAN
Come on What sort of assassins
tell you they’re coming

MARIKO
Assassins bound by a strict code of
honor They do not kill for a
living Killing is their way of
life it is their faith And this
pearl is a warning Your only
chance for survival

LOGAN
Yeah howzzat

MARIKO
According to myth you must
challenge their master and kill him
in combat Not only will you be
spared You will become the new
Master of The Clan

LOGAN
Done Who is he

MARTIKO
That is the riddle No one knows
Logan laughs bounces the pearl on the table

MARIKO (CONTD)
It is no laughing matter You
should leave

LOGAN
Japan
MARIKO
Tonight
LOGAN
I’m not ready to do that
MARIKO
Logan why did you come here
LOGAN
That’s a long story With a lot of
holes
MARIKO
Tell me

Logan smiles shakes his head Mariko places her hand
on his arm speaking firmly now

MARIKO (CONTD)
Youre safe here Tell me

Logan casually opens his mouth to speak but he
freezes at a loss for words It isn’t that he won’t
speak He can’t We hold on him for the longest time
as he struggles to tell her who he is what he is
But the harder he tries the harder it becomes His
eyes burn with tears his face trembles overcome
with centuries of repressed emotions lifetimes of
forgotten pain Logan is paralyzed

MARIKO (CONTD)
I’m here for you Logan I’m here
Talk to me

She wraps her arms around him holding him tight

INT PALATIAL SUITE - BEDROOM - DAWN

Logan sleeps soundly And for the first time when he
wakes he does so slowly quietly At peace

LOGAN
I didn’t dream Not at all

44

He looks expecting to find Mariko But she isn’t
there Confused he gets up walks expectantly to
INT PALATIAL HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAWN
Silent Empty No food on the table No candles no
fire The television silently shows the funeral

aftermath Noburo’s flabby face fills the screen

Curious at first Logan moves from one room to the
next his anxiety increasing He cannot find Mariko

Then he finds a note resting on the table by her
grandfathers sword He unfolds it It reads

Kuzuri-

Go where you will looking only to the future
I go where I must taking comfort in the past

-Mariko

Logan lets the note fall to the floor stunned
Crushed He might stand there all day but then

He freezes sensing something He follows his keen
ears to the front door listens for a beat then

With blinding speed he rips the door open grabs A
MAN form the hallway pins him to the wall and

SCHINK - presses the tips of his claws tot he man’s
chin But then the killer look leaves Logan’s eyes

ZEN
I’ve turned a blind eye long enough
Where is she

LOGAN
I get the feeling she doesn’t want to be
found

ZEN

Mr Logan please

Logan lets him go Zen walks into the suite
looking around for Mariko

LOGAN
Where’s the information you promised me

Zen is momentarily confused
Zen stops

LOGAN (CONT’D)
Who am I Where I come from What
was done to me and why You said
you had answers Where are they

ZEN
I I told you What you seek will
be yours when you-

LOGAN
Honor the gift that was given to
me yeah yeah- She’s not here

searching turns back to Logan

LOGAN (CONT’D)

So your master spared my life As
far as I’m concerned I spared his
Since then I saved his son and his
granddaughter The way I see it
the old man is into me for some
honor - not the other way ‘round
So give me what I came here for

ZEN
There is more to honor than doing
what is so obviously right

LOGAN
What other kind of honor is there

ZEN
When you can answer that you will
have the peace you’re looking for

LOGAN
Zen I gotta tell you you’re being
kind of a stereotype right now
Just a little bit

ZEN
We have no time for this We have
to find Mariko

LOGAN
When were you going to tell me
about the Black Clan

Zen can’t hide his surprise Beat

ZEN
Would you have believed me

LOGAN
Doubt it Are they the ones who
tried to kill Shingen

ZEN
(almost laughing)
Those men at the funeral were
Yakuza Tokyo Underworld

LOGAN
That’s a shame They were pretty
soft These Clan guys - they
don’t wear crazy-ass electrified
silver armor do they

(off Zen’s bewildered look)
A little conspicuous Maybe not

ZEN
What happened after you left
with Mariko

LOGAN
(ignoring this)
Why would the mob want to kill
Shingen

ZEN
I cannot say

LOGAN
(nodding to TV)
Does it have something to do with
this guy The Minister of Justice

ZEN
I am not permitted to discuss it
I’m sorry

LOGAN
There was a kid outside - before
the funeral He was trying to get
in Very angry-

ZEN
(a little too fast)
He is not Yakuza

Logan’s hit a nerve Now he looks at Zen

LOGAN
No He’s a Yashida

ZEN
What Makes you think that
Logan taps the side of his nose

LOGAN
It always knows Who is he Zen

ZEN
It’s not important

LOGAN
He tried to kill Mariko

Zen cannot believe his ears

ZEN
What happened

LOGAN
You scratch my back bub

ZEN
(agitated)
I am not permitted to discuss the
family with outsiders I am bound
by an oath to my master

LOGAN
Your master is dead

ZEN
My loyalty to him is not

Logan can see he’s hurt Zen He might even feel a
little sorry A little

ZEN (CONTD)
Please We must find Mariko If you
care at all about her you’1l-

Logan turns to the window looking out over Tokyo
Now it is Zen who has hit a nerve After a beat

ZEN (CONTD)
I see You have feelings for her

LOGAN
I have feelings I don’t remember
who they’re for But they fit
nice on her

ZEN
You must forget her

LOGAN
She’s about the only thing I can
remember

ZEN

I mean put her out of your mind

LOGAN

(facing Zen)
My mind What makes you think I
trust my mind Zen My mind is
broken

(points to his heart)
I trust this This is never wrong
This never forgets It goes where
it wants And when it gets there
it stays Forever

(turning back to the window)
I didn’t ask for that Anymore than
I asked to be what I am

ZEN
I’m sorry Logan Truly But even
if she were not promised to another
man she could never be for you
She is noble blood Sole heir to
the House Yashida You are

LOGAN
Say it Unworthy

Zen’s silence tells him he is right Logan nods
bitterly used to that sort of thing He thinks
grabs his jacket heads for the door

LOGAN (CONTD)

I may not be worthy in the eyes of
your precious family But I can
save it

ZEN
Where are you going

LOGAN
Someone wants to kill Mariko And
her father Now they’1ll have to
deal with me

And the door slams behind him blending nicely with
the sound of twelve hundred pounds of slapping fat

The rippling back of a SUMO WRESTLER his diapered
back-side roaring toward us feet scrambling for

where he sits calmly puffing a cigar in the front row
of a CHEERING CHAIN SMOKING AUDIENCE

ON THE PLATFORM ABOVE THE WINNING SUMO raises his
arms in victory flinging sweat Logan blinks rubs
one eye disgusted but cool Then he looks over at

AN EXECUTIVE BOX containing a DOZEN MEN IN SHARK-SKIN

Rank is obvious factoring age body-language amount
of overall movement The OLDEST MAN mid-60s sits
dead center motionless with GOONS whispering in
each ear He is obviously the top dog The Big Man

THE OYABUN

Logan studies the box for a while then stands and
heads that way It takes a moment before he sense
someone walking in step behind his right shoulder He
stops turns comes to face to face with

YUKIO

LOGAN

‘The hell are you doing here
YUKIO

I am your bodyguard
LOGAN

My what
YUKIO

LOGAN

Yukio doesn’t move Logan sighs

LOGAN (CONTD)
I don’t have time to spar with you
Just follow me and keep your mouth
shut KATO

YUKIO

LOGAN

YUKIO

Yukio It’s my name

Logan sighs approaches the executive box BODYGUARDS
block his path One tucks a hand in his jacket

LOGAN
That hand comes back empty or I
break it off Cagney-hito

BODYGUARD
Private party Go round

LOGAN
I want to talk to the Oyabun

The Bodyguards blanch - the very word should not be
spoken Logan points right at the top man

LOGAN (CONTD)
Right there The Oyabun That’s
what they call him right

The Oyabun does not react even if every other Goon
in the box does The Bodyguards press close one of
them jabbing a gun in Logan’s ribs

LOGAN (CONTD)
You’re going to have to eat with a
fork when I’m done with you-

Logan Over his shoulder the Oyabun sits stone-like

SINATRA
What is it you want

LOGAN
I want to talk to your boss

SINATRA
Why would he want to talk back

LOGAN
‘Cuz I’m the white devil killed

SINATRA
Bring him around

They shove Logan and Yukio Logan plays along

INT SUMO ARENA - BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - DAY

The Bodyguards nod Sinatra nods back The Bodyguards

push Logan in stop Yukio from following and shut
the door Logan pulls a cigar

LOGAN
Mind if I you know what I’11l
just breathe

He puts the cigar away

SINATRA
You wanted to talk Start talking

LOGAN
Leave the Yashida family alone

SINATRA
Is that the speech

LOGAN
That’s the speech Anything happens
to Shingen or his daughter I’11l
skin your boss and turn him into a
track-suit

Long pause The Oyabun laughs More of a bark really Then
Sinatra laughs genuinely amused

SINATRA
The stones on this guy How do you
walk those stones Sonkei

But Logan is not laughing

SINATRA (CONTD)
Let me ask you something Cowboy
Does The Oyabun look stupid to you

LOGAN
Really

SINATRA
Do you have any idea the heat we
have on us right now Do you have
any idea the heat we would have it
Shingen was dead Does The Oyabun
look like a man who likes heat
Asks for it Sends button men to a
funeral In broad daylight The
Minister of Justice sitting there

LOGAN
Youre saying you didn’t try to put
a hit on Shingen’s family

SINATRA
We took a bid sure We don’t run a
tea shop And the job was for
Shingen only No one else The
money was tempting too But we
turned it down

LOGAN
Who was the bidder

SINATRA
Hey whoa I don’t know and I don’t
want to know I’m management

LOGAN
But you’re sure those thugs weren’t
yours
SINATRA
I didn’t say that I said we turned
the job down Couple-six guys from
the outfit didn’t hear so good
Took it on themselves to carry out
an un-sanctioned hit You can bet
when the one you left alive gets
out of the hospital he’s gonna fall
on a knife two-three times in jail
Going after a big fish like Shingen
is just bad business We leave jobs
like that to The Black Clan

Beat That name again

LOGAN

What do you know about them
SINATRA

I know not to ask you start

looking at The Clan The Clan looks
back you follow We’re just
Yakuza We know our place

He lets that hang in the air a beat then

SINATRA (CONTD)
But listen From me on behalf of
the Old Man here Shingen and his
family are protected Off limits
As for you The only reason you
don’t have a bullet in your eye
right now is the Oyabun thinks
youre funny And he wanted to
thank you personally

LOGAN
Thank me

SINATRA
If you hadn’t killed our guys they
might’ve killed Shingen Then wed
really be in the toilet So hey
Cowboy Arigato And I mean Domo

The Oyabun stands bows ever so slightly

OYABUN
Domo arigato

He walks out leaving Logan to wonder what the hell
just happened Sinatra follows stopping at the door
SINATRA
You need anything while you’re in
Tokyo anything at all You come

see me
(turns to leave stops)
And uh Just out of curiosity

Why do you think we’d want to kill
Shingen anyway

LOGAN
Because he backs Noburo And
Noburo’s cracking down on the
Yakuza

SINATRA

Crack-down

(laughs )
Do you see a crack-down anywhere
The cops arrest some low level
guys shut down a few strip-clubs
Noburo makes a speech After the
elections it’s business as usual
You do it different in The States

LOGAN
I’m Canadian

SQUARE JAW
That’s unbelievable Anyway it’s

to nick his earlobe Noburo’s eyes spring open along
with his mouth Logan looms over him in nothing but
jeans and a t-shirt soaking wet he came by moat

Noburo inhales to scream and

SCHLICK - A second set of claws spring forth the
middle blade gently resting on Noburo’s tongue

LOGAN
Shhhh Don’t want to wake the babe

Noburo glances to his left where a TRAMPY YOUNG WOMAN
is sleeping snoring slightly a hand-cuff dangling
from one wrist One the floor we see an assortment of
leather props and sundries Noburo’s a freak

Tying up a few lose ends before the

Noburo’s eyes darken Startled but not scared

LOGAN (CONT’D)
The truth is a funny thing Nobes
It always comes out Always I
know about your deal with the
Yakuza

LOGAN (CONT’D)
And when it comes to light you’1ll
bring disgrace on Mariko’s family
Now as the House Yashida’s self-
appointed enforcer I can’t have
that So tomorrow morning youll
make a formal announcement calling
of the wedding That or I come
back here and take out your
tonsils Through your forehead

SCHINK - His claws retract leaving a hairline cut
down the center of Noburo’s tongue Noburo laughs

LOGAN (CONT’D)
You need counselling bub

NOBURO
Me disgrace Mariko’s family I am
the only thing standing between her
and disgrace The Old Man was a
fool How much money do you think
was left after a lifetime wasted
helping the sick and the poor
Where d you think Shingen’s money
comes from now It’s the first rule
of money gai-jin Behind every
green fortune is a crime

Logan considers this knowing it’s unusually true

NOBURO (CONTD)
And you’re wrong about the truth
It doesn’t have to come out Not if
you marry the man in charge of
looking for it TAKE HIM

Logan springs without looking half an instant before an arrow
punches into the head-board directly over Noburo A single
drop of liquid drips from the shaft and onto Noburo’s
forehead He screams as

Logan rolls and comes up on his feet A second bold catches
him between his neck and shoulder It over-penetrates
exposing the narrow steel tip Steaming poison drops from a
hollow point

CLOSE ON A mechanical auto-loading compound crossbow
swiftly prepping another shot

A pair of slender GREEN GLOVED HANDS shoulder the crossbow
to REVEAL THE FACE OF

NOBURO’S SECRETARY no longer in her business-attire
but a skin-tight backless green number complete

with a black gun-belt and boots The butt of the cross-
bow pushes back that sultry lock of hair to reveal a
long strangely appealing scar on her cheek We liked
her before Now we’d gladly let her beat us to death

This is VIPER

KA-SHUNK KA-SHUNK KA-SHUNK - The crossbow spits out
bolts two per second Logan dodges charges closing
the gap and hacking the crossbow in two

But nimble minx that she is Logan can’t seem to
catch Viper In turn she draws her pistol and fires
but she can’t stand still long enough to place a
shot Logan’s claws rake her forearm She drops the
gun but never makes a sound

She pulls a knife deftly avoiding his claws Logan
catches her wrist driving his claw deep into the
wall slamming his body into hers She’s pinned

Time stops Logan and Viper are nose-to-nose now
breathing hard She has the slightest smile

Logan looks at his forearm marked with a single
superficial cut one that doesn’t heal

Logan’s POV of Viper’s knife-hand clutched in
his The blade gleams with a honey-like oil

Suddenly his vision blurs He instinctively glances
at the crossbow bolt in his shoulder

Viper kisses him Then heaves hard and kicks him back
across the room Logan staggers wipes out an end-
table collapses He grabs the cross-bow bolt

NOISES O0S The sound of feet running up the stairs
Viper straddles Logan like a bull She grabs him by
the hair pulls his head back and puts her knife to
his pulsing jugular

Logan roars thrusting himself up bucking Viper off

his back and into a full-length mirror At the same
time he launches himself through the bay window

The Guards rush out Noburo’s Trampy Mistress stirs

studying traces of his blood Fascinated

trembling pale and weak The wounds on his arm and

How long have you been standing th-

LOGAN
Long enough

MARIKO
Is it true what Logan says

SHINGEN
Absolutely not Logan has twisted
lies and circumstantial evidence to
fit his predetermined conclusion
All In misguided attempt to fulfill
some cryptic bargain he had with
your grandfather

Shingen opens his desk drawer pulls out a stack of
legal paper and throws it on the desk

SHINGEN (CONTD)
It’s all there in his will
(to Zen)
What is this thing my grandfather
left him Give it to this gai-jin
so he can leave us in peace

was explicit-

Explicit ‘Honor the gift that was
given to you’ Honor he says

(to Logan)
As if you knew the meaning of the
word
LOGAN
We’re not here to talk about my
honor

He broke into Noburo’s home last
night and assaulted him Then he
attacked his secretary

Zen and Mariko both look at Logan in shock

MARTIKO
Is this true

Not the way he tells it

Wrong answer Zen bows his head Mariko’s hand goes
to her lips stunned

LOGAN (CONTD)
Mariko your father is using you

ZEN
For God’s sake Logan hold your
tongue

He’s corrupted your grandfathers
legacy for profit and he’s selling
you to the Minister of Justice for
protection

Okay say I’m wrong D you love
him Do you love Noburo

He speaks to feelings she can never openly admit She
struggles to remind herself

you love him
He asks as much for himself as he does for her
Mariko looks down

Afraid to use a real blade

SHINGEN

Shingen strikes Logan rolls grabs the sword and
springs to his feet Zen pulls Mariko out of the way

retreat doing more blocking with his body than his
blade The duel carries them into

of his wrists his grip on the sword

CLOSE ON Logan’s hands as they adjust relax learn

Shingen attacks again With each strike Logan
becomes stronger faster more adept And then

WHACK - Logan’s sword catches Shingen in the ribs
sending him back hopping on one foot Real pain

LOGAN
They made me a quick study old
man Keep it coming

Shingen focuses attacks The speed of swords
increases the bone-jarring impact decrease Soon
the blades are a blur and neither man seems able to
strike the other until

WHACK - Another strike snaps Logan’s sword in half

WHACK - Shingen hits him in the ribs Logan backs up
defenseless Shingen presses the fight Logan blocks
the wooden blade with his forearms taking the pain

WHACK - Shingen catches Logan in the jaw Logan
struggles to stay on his feet He’d love to kill
Shingen only Mariko’s presence holds him back

SHINGEN
He is not human Mariko You saw
that for yourself What you have
not seen is the true nature of the
beast

WHACK - Mariko cries out Zen cannot bear to look

SHINGEN (CONTD)

He is determined to hide his true
self from you

(WHACK)
But I-

(WHACK)
Will bring it-

(WHACK)
OUT

Shingen swings with everything he has for Logan’s
neck and

SCHINK-WHACK - Logans claws hack Shingen’s sword in
two He grabs Shingen by the throat driving him into
winding up to drive them home when

MARIKO
LOGAN

Time stops Logan is suspended in a state of pure
rage unable to back down unable to finish

He sees the look of horror in her eyes - sees what
she sees in him now Shingen sees it too But he is
too cool to smile or gloat Instead

SHINGEN
I give you the beast

Logan seems to melt back into something more human
claws retracting slowly his grip on Shingen
loosening And with the melting comes devastation

SHINGEN (CONTD)
Out of respect for my father I
will give you the opportunity to
leave Japan Tonight

Logan ignores this turning to

LOGAN
Mariko-

MARTIKO
Leave Please Leave this house
and never return

Crushed Logan walks out When he is gone Shingen
turns angrily to Zen

SHINGEN
What is this thing my father left
him in his will And where is it

ZEN
Wit hall respect your father
instructed that only Logan-

SHINGEN
MY FATHER IS DEAD I AM YOUR MASTER
NOW YOU WILL ANSWER TO ME

ZEN
(trembling with anger)
Your father lives

ZEN (CONTD)
So long as I honor him Under pain
of death I will not answer

SHINGEN
Death and pain are two very
different things Zen

And the way he says it chills Zen’s blood Then

SHINGEN (CONTD)
You are discharged Leave this
house at once

It is my daughter’s wedding day

Zen You did not send a gift

Zen takes a half-step back

CLOSE ON The handle of a small knife on the desk
behind Zen just a few paces away

SHINGEN (CONTD)
This made me wonder if I had not
offended you somehow I thought to
myself perhaps I have been too
harsh with Zen

Zen’s right hand drops to his side just a short reach
from the knife handle
SHINGEN (CONTD)
Then another part of me thought
I have not been harsh enough

ZEN
I know what you’ve come for Lord
Shingen I thought I made myself
clear you cannot make me talk

SHINGEN
No I can’t But she can

Viper holds up a steel syringe the five inch needle
dripping thick amber liquid Zen lunges for the
knife grabbing the handle just ask

THWACK - another knife pins his hand to the desk Zen
screams in pain

ANGLE ON Shingen frozen at the end of his throw
pleased with his marksmanship He turns to Viper

SHINGEN (CONTD)
By all means take your time

Viper smiles and moves toward Zen We cover Zen’s
scream with the steam whistles and rattling steel of

EXT TOKYO WATERFRONT - NIGHT

Not far from the rail-yards the city itself is a
distant gleam We settle on a run-down bar

INT RUN-DOWN BAR - NIGHT
PATRONS stare in mute awe at the drinking prowess of

Logan sitting at the bar wit ha single-shot glass
and THREE EMPTY WHISKEY BOTTLES HAMMERED OUT OF HIS
MIND BARELY ABLE TO SEE As a fourth arrives Logan
takes cash from his pocket to pay unaware of

EXTREME CLOSE UP ON THE GRAY-GREEN PEARL dropping
from the folded bills and bouncing down the bar A
WOMAN’S SLENDER HAND catches it Meanwhile

CLOSE ON Logan’s shot-glass as he pours Just as the
whiskey reaches the brim another shot-glass slides
in next to his pushing it aside and slowly filling
Logan looks up letting his woozy eyes focus on

A STUNNING PARI OF CAT-LIKE EYES under a hanging
shock of otherwise closely-cropped hair Yukio has
trades her chauffeur’s outfit for cargo pants and a
tank-top showing off lean hard arms

YUKIO
Drinking to forget

LOGAN
I don’t remember

YUKIO
You want me to leave you alone

Logan sizes her up inhales deeply

LOGAN
Eventually

And off her sly smile

INT YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - SHINGEN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

CLOSE ON A FLY crawling along the edge of Zen’s
metal box laying open on Shingen’s desk

Inside is a single sheet of that thin typewriter
paper A hand reaches for it The fly zips away

PULL BACK TO REVEAL Shingen the pages spread out on
the desk - some dense with military jargon others
containing schematics diagrams eerie da Vinci-like
sketches of dissected arms and legs And claws

PROJECT WOLVERINE

Shingen sits back contemplating what he has read turning a
silver letter opener on his fingers Viper enters and sits
putting her feet on the desk

VIPER
Well what is it

SHINGEN
It’s his life A life he can’t
remember And several other lies
they implanted to try and hide it

VIPER
They

Shingen hands her a few pages As she reads

SHINGEN
Even if he could remember he
would never know what was truth and
what was fiction Not without this

He gestures to all of the paper on his desk

VIPER
Does it tell you anything useful

Shingen holds up a finely detailed schematic - a
densely rendered cut-away of Logan’s body complete
with lines pointing to specific vitals

SHINGEN
He’s as easy to kill as any other
Man One just needs to be precise

Shingen flings the letter opener and we hear it strike 0OS
Viper turns to find the letter opener stuck in the doorjamb -
impaling the fly

VIPER

First you have to find him
SHINGEN

You forget who I am I know

exactly where he is right now

LOGAN (PRE-LAP)
(singing)
You’ve got to get up
You’ve got to get up
Youve got to get up in the
moooooorning

EXT RAIL-YARD - NIGHT

Logan is hammered taking a long pull of whiskey
Yukio is under his arm propping him up as

LOGAN
Some day I’m going to murder the
buglerSome day they’re gonna find
him deadI‘1l amputate his
revilleAnd step upon it heavily
And spend the rest of my life in-

Logan trips and falls taking Yukio down with him
They land on hard gravel laughing

YUKIO
What is that from

LOGAN
A war

YUKIO
Which one

He realizes he can’t recall

LOGAN
You smell nice

YUKIO
Car wax

LOGAN

Gasoline too I like that

YUKIO
A little dab behind each ear

LOGAN
I’m hungry Where can a guy find
pizza in this town

She looks deep in his eyes shaking her head

LOGAN (CONT’D)
Gotta be a decent pizza somewhere
You want some pizza

YUKIO
Eventually

She kisses him We notice the knife handle sticking
out the back of Yukio’s belt

LOGAN
Marikommmm

YUKIO
Yeah okay

CLOSE ON LOGAN’S EYE springing open realizing He grabs
Yukio and tries to roll over She wraps her legs around him
and pins him back kissing him hard

LOGAN
Get off

YUKIO
I’m trying

The harder he fights the harder she digs in Finally
he grabs her by the throat pushing her back She
looks down at him with a wild look in her eyes

YES

YUKIO (CONTD)

Logan shoves her and they roll over as

AN EXPLOSION OF SOUND A screaming wall of steel streaking
past at two hundred miles per hour Logan and Yukio have been

making out between
laughing Logan is
until the train is

-US BOTH
Death is

Might as

And she means it

the rails of a bullet train Yukio is
yelling at her We can’t hear any of it
gone

LOGAN
KILLED

YUKIO
waiting for all of us
well make it interesting

LOGAN

Youre crazy

YUKIO

And worth all the trouble

She kisses him again He shoves her back stands - wobbly
but sober from adrenaline He walks away

YUKIO (CONTD)

Where are you going

LOGAN

Australia

YUKIO

Aw Come on It was just getting-

THUNK - Something clouts her on the side of the head and
knocks her out She falls without making a sound

ANGLE ON Logan calling back over his shoulder

LOGAN

Look youre a very nice girl And
by that I mean smokin’ hot and
completely out of your mind which
has one very invigorating upside b-

He turns to finish and freezes Yukio is gone - vanished -

despite wide open space in any direction

LOGAN (CONT’D)
Yukio
(tense beat)
YUKI-

VVVVVVVP - An arrow pierces Logan’s forearm Where
you might scream

LOGAN (CONT’D)
What the-

VVVVVVVP - Another arrow through his other forearm
That hurt He goes to grab it but his hand is pulled
back Each arrow is attached to a long thin cord

Annoyed he tries to extend his claws But they
extend only an inch or two The arrows have disabled
them Suddenly Logan is stretched in two directions
at once the pain intensifying

VVVP-VVVP-VVVP - more arrows more cords more pain

Then A DOZEN FIGURES emerge from the darkness - MEN
IN BACK KARATE GI’S short hair slicked back and
glistering skin died black as pitch

LOGAN (CONT’D)
You must be the Black Clan
(beat)
That ink you have on Hides your
scent Very clever

Each man draws a blade - nothing fancy There are no
flashy moves No bullshit showboat choreography
these men are hunters And Logan is a snared trophy

LOGAN (CONT’D)
Tell you what I’m gonna doe Let me
go now and I’1l leave you with
some back teeth for chewing

But the keep coming
LOGAN (CONT’D)
Guys guys guys Seriously I’ve
been drinking It makes me mean

Still they keep coming Logan sighs

LOGAN (CONTD)
Damn This was a nice jacket too
Despite the pain Logan grabs the arrows by their
heads and pulls them through his forearms

SCHINK - Then he cuts the cords before attacking the
stunned Men of the Clan They’ve seen a lot but
never that But their amazement is short lived

Without a sound - not a scream not a yell not even
the sound of feet on loose gravel - twenty-four men
with swords attack Meanwhile

EXT RAIL-YARD - ELSEWHERE - NIGHT

CLOSE ON Yukio a smear of blood on the side of her
head a bruise on her temple Her eyes flutter open
to the sound of clanging steel OS

PULL BACK TO REVEAL She is flat on the ground behind
a railroad car her hands bound behind her back
Instinctively they reach for the blade back there
finding only an empty sheath She lays on her belly
and contorts her entire body curling backward until
he heels nearly touch the small of her back She
pulls a three inch blade from her boot and slashes
through her restraints The she kicks off her boots
exposing something shiny in the lining Meanwhile

EXT RAIL-YARD - NIGHT
Logan deliberately literally meets a blade head-on

CLANG - The sword has cleanly split the skin on
Logna’s forehead but not his skull much to the
stunned bewilderment of the swordsman Logan growls
and his claws close in pincer-fashion on the
swordsman

SCHLUNK - Logans head heals as he catches the man’s
sword letting the body fall He grips the sword in
hands bristling with blades cocking it like a bat

LOGAN
Let it be said I did warn you

He charges They charge Meanwhile

THWIP THWIP THWIP - Three of The Clan go down
clutching their necks Yukio emerges from the
darkness her left fist full of scalpel-like knives
She snatches up a sword as she runs through the gap
she’s created landing back-to-back with Logan

LOGAN (CONT’D)
Thought I’d lost you there

YUKIO
And miss out on getting killed by
The Black Clan Never

LOGAN
I preferred the bullet-train

YUKIO
Are you asking me out

LOGAN
Please try to focus

The Black Clan circles studying looking for a
weakness They nod to one another as if reading each
other’s minds Creepy

LOGAN (CONTD)
COME ON

YUKIO
Hey man if you’re in a hurry

Yukio screams and attacks

LOGAN
Chick’s out of her mind

He goes after her - met halfway by two flailing
swordsmen He takes one out but the other drives a
sword clean through his belly Another swordsman
attacks from behind stabbing Logan through the back

Logan screams grabs the blade of the swordsman in
front of him and drives it through his own body
impaling the swordsman behind him He grabs the
swordsman in front of him and impales him on the blade
protruding from his belly

We notice the swordsmen die with oddly peaceful
expressions Eerie As they both fall the man behind
Logan takes his blade with him The man in front
leaves his sword in Logan’s belly He pulls it out
and uses it to challenge all comers

LOGAN (CONTD)
WHOS NEXT WHO IS NEXT YOU

But no one will fight him The Men of the Black Clan
back away and drop to their knees bow their heads
Stillness Logan is woozy neck bulging in severe
pain He collapses Yukio kneels beside him -
astonished as she watches his wounds slowly heal

Suddenly A NEW MAN is there - wearing the same black
clothes as the others but with no ink on his face It
is a placid serene face Young Strong But not a

killer More like a MONK That’s what we’1ll call him

As the Monk studies Logan the surviving Men of the
Black Clan nod one by one almost like a vote The
Monk kneels and places an object on Logan’s chest

CLOSE ON A SINGLE BRILLIANT WHITE PEARL

The Monk stands and walks away as A DOZEN MORE CLAN

emerge from the darkness implying an inexhaustible

supply They gather the bodies of the dead and dying
and vanish into the shadows Not a single sound

Logan grabs the pearl in his bloody fist and tries to
stand but can’t Yukio tries to help but he is dead
weight She grabs him by his tattered leather jacket
dragging him along the gravel Logan screams in pain
Yukio looks around empty rail-yard as far as the eye
can see - no sign of life no help It’s a last
cause but she won’t quit She is walking backward
her pace slowing until she hits a wall of steel

She drops Logan turns and comes face to face with
SILVER SAMURAI

Bravely Yukio grabs for a blade without thinking
Sadly she isn’t fast enough

FWACK

BLACK

No sound A bright flash Sparks We are looking down
at a vaguely human form submerged in a tank of water
But this is not Logan’s dream What emerges this
time is shining metal water sizzling off in sheets
Steam clears TO REVEAL

Armor The tachyon-charged suit of Silver Samurai

Logan’s eyes spring open He sits up suddenly as

SCHINK - He readies to fight

YUKIO
Wait-WAIT

Yukio rushes to him grabbing his writs and gently urging
him back Logan’s eyes focus on

INT FORGE - DAY

Part smelter part loft apartment part shrine to the
lost code of Bushido the Samurai’s forge is where
one imagines hell’s blacksmith might kick back

Emerging from the steam in a leather apron and no
shirt is Kenuichio the Angry Young Man from the
funeral and wedding His only weapon a cup of tea

KENUICHIO
Drink

YUKIO
This is Kenuichio He’s a friend

Logan spies a nice new bruise on Yukio’s chin

LOGAN
Your friend’s give you that

YUKIO
I might have tried to kill hima
little My blood was up

LOGAN
We weren’t exactly friends at the
funeral either

KENUICHIO
My apologies I thought you were
trying to kidnap Mariko Not save
her life

LOGAN
I understand You were just looking
out for your sister

Beat As Logan takes the tea

KENUICHIO
Half-sister But how did you know

LOGAN
I knew you were related to Shingen
I didn’t know how until just now

YUKIO
Lord Shingen is your father

KENUICHIO

Not according to Shingen I don’t
mean to say he neglected me He’s
given me money education

(gestures to the Forge)
Without knowing it he’s made all
of this possible

(face darkens)
But he will not see me He will not
even acknowledge that I exist

YUKIO
Where’s your mother

KENUICHIO
She took her own life The shame of
having a bastard was

That’s as far as Kenuichio can go without cracking
Yukio is genuinely touched by this

LOGAN
Does Mariko know she has a brother

KENUICHIO
No But I watch over her That is
how you and I met

LOGAN
And tonight you just happened to be
out fora stroll at the rail-yard in
your Sunday-go-to-meetin’

KENUICHIO
You have been marked by The Black
Clan I first sensed they were
watching you at my Grandfathers
funeral I knew if I followed you
I would eventually find them

LOGAN
An Assassin groupie Very kinky
(re Yukio)
I’m not judging She has a thing
for getting run over by trains

KENUICHIO
(ignoring this)
I had hoped to find their master
and challenge him I wish to be
Master of the Black Clan
LOGAN
Not a doctor The front end of a
Cadillac maybe

KENUICHIO
Warlord Samurai Shogun Prime
Minister Parliament Emperor
These come and go But The Clan is
eternal Undying The true keepers
of Japan’s destiny They believe
that one man and one man alone must
rule bound only by his will Not
politics or popular opinion And at
his command they gently steer
Japan through the ocean of time

YUKIO
Removing those who would stand in
her way

LOGAN

So they’re fascists

KENUICHIO
They tend to soil prune the tree
Without sentiment or sympathy

Logan and Yukio share a look Kenuichio clearly
it even if they don’t

LOGAN
Wow Okay Uh Digest that
later right now bigger fish to
fry Being as I’m marked for death
and you seem to be the guy to ask
who is the Master of the Clan

KENUICHIO
Was

LOGAN
Pardon

KENUICHIO

Who was the Master He is dead as
far as I can tell But he must not
have died in combat This would
mean The Black Clan are Ronin now
Leaderless There will be a contest
to choose a new master from
champions selected by The Clan

LOGAN
And how do you know this

gets

KENUICHIO
Because you have been chosen

Kenuichio holds up the white pearl left on Logan’s
body after his encounter with The Black Clan

KENUICHIO (CONTD)
For as long as I can remember I
have dreamed of receiving such an
honor It is the mark of a true
warrior And now it is yours

Logan takes the simple pearl suddenly imbued
with intense symbolic power After a beat

LOGAN
So what happens next

KENUICHIO
You will kill or be killed
(off Logan’s look)
You have no choice in the matter
Your opponent will hunt you to the
ends of the Earth to win the prize

LOGAN
What if neither of us want to be
Master
KENUICHIO
Youre saying you don’t
LOGAN
Well I’ve got my thing It’s a

big change you know

KENUICHIO
You hold immense power in your
hand Logan-san A nation’s
destiny The fate of millions It
is not to be taken lightly

LOGAN
Yeah No Clearly not Just out of
curiosity where does this leave
us You and me

KENUICHIO
I will wait for the match to be
decided Then I will challenge the
new Master You understand this is
in no way personal I have great
affection for you

LOGAN
Affection

KENUICHIO
You saved the lives of my family

Yukio can’t help but make a sound of sympathy in her
throat Logan shoots her a look “Are you nuts”

LOGAN
So we’re gonna go Thanks for
letting us freshen up and
I’ll see you on the field of
battle I guess

KENUICHIO
I look forward to it

LOGAN
I’m sure you do
(to Yukio)
Ready Good Let’s go

EXT STREET - NIGHT

A remote section of industrial Tokyo’s warehouse
district Desolate at night Logan and Yukio step out
as a massive steel door closes slowly behind them

LOGAN
I‘ll say this Lord Shingen has
one messed-up family

YUKIO
This matters to you

LOGAN
It matters to Mariko Her father’s
disgraced the family And she’s
caught in the middle of it with no
one to help her

YUKIO
You have problems of your own right
now You’re wanted by the police
not to mention the Black Clan-

LOGAN
That can wait Right now I need to
help Mariko She needs to see that
her father is her own worst enemy

YUKIO
How can you prove that

LOGAN
Somewhere in that third bottle of
hooch my mind went back to the
funeral - the men who tired to kill
Shingen Someone wanted him dead
Someone had a reason My gut says
that reason is the key to
everything If I could just find
out who gave the order

But it’s hopeless Until

YUKIO
When I’m lost I go back to where
things began

Logan considers this and nods

LOGAN
Youre right You’re absolutely
right Yukio
(starts walking)
Thanks I’1ll see you around

YUKIO
(going after him)
Where are you going

LOGAN
To see a sick friend

YUKIO
I’1ll go with you

LOGAN
Not this again please

She grabs his arm stopping him

YUKIO
I can help you

LOGAN
Some people are gonna get hurt

YUKIO
Then I can really help you

LOGAN
What’s Shingen giving you for
following me
Her smile fades She tries to play dumb until

LOGAN (CONT’D)
My bodyguard Yukio Come on

Awkward pause Then Yukio caves

YUKIO
I’m an orphan Not even a half-
blooded Japanese Shingen promised
to be my master A servant of the
House Yashida Can you understand
what that means

LOGAN
It means you’re a servant with
better clothes

YUKIO
He said you’re a mindless killer -
that you threatened his daughter I
can see now that he was lying I
can tell you’re an honorable man

Logan scoffs She drops to one knee

YUKIO (CONT’D)
I wish to serve you Logan-san

LOGAN
You wish to serve the next Master
of the Black Clan you mean

Yukio can’t hide her wry grin

YUKIO
This had also crossed my mind

LOGAN
There won’t be a death-match
Yukio I’m not gonna be the Master
of the Black Clan

YUKIO
But you heard Kenuichio You have
no choice

LOGAN
I never have a choice That doesn’t
mean I have to play along

He turns and walks away Again she follows

YUKIO
Please Logan-san Take me with
you

LOGAN

Leave me alone

YUKIO
I’1ll show you I am worth-

He turns showing enough rage to stop her cold

LOGAN
Don’t you get it I want to be
alone I don’t need you I don’t
want you and certainly don’t trust
you NOW GET LOST

Yukio recoils but stands her ground her eyes filing
with tears He raises a hand and now she backs away

LOGAN (CONTD)
GO

YUKIO
I should have let them kill you

Yukio turns and runs Only then do Logan’s eyes
betray his true feelings He turns and heads the
other way disgusted with himself

INT FORGE - NIGHT

Kenuichio at the window watching Yukio and Logan
part ways

VOICE (0S)
You should have killed him

KENUICHIO
After the new Master is chosen

And from out of the darkness Viper emerges to stand at his
side taking his hand

VIPER
Do you think you can kill him

KENUICHIO
With your help It’s certain But
first we deal with Mariko

KENUICHIO (CONTD)
When she is dead I will be
Shingen’s only child He will have
no choice but to recognize me as
his sole heir

He looks around at the Forge with disgust

KENUICHIO (CONTD)
Then finally I can emerge from
the shadows and be called by my
true name

VIPER
Kenuichio Yashida

KENUICHIO
(taking her in his arms)
And when the House Yashida and The
Black Clan are gone No one No
one will ever ignore me again

They kiss And as they do we MOVE IN CLOSE ON
A NEEDLE in Viper’s hand It pierces the back of his
neck and he shivers Whatever this concoction is it
works for him He smiles looking deep into her eyes
VIPER
Never forget who you love Never

forget who you serve

KENUICHIO
Never Never

And they kiss again

Est

INT TOKYO METROPOLITAN HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

MOVE SLOWLY down a corridor toward TWO POLICE
OFFICERS standing guard outside a private room

Quiet at this hour save the sound of heart monitors
the faint chatter of nurses the odd page on the PA
We linger long enough to get used to it Then

A faint sound stirs the Cops from their thousand-yard
stare They share a look wait They hear it again

Ka-chunk Ka-chunk - Very far away

They open the door they are guarding and look into

INT TOKYO METROPOLITAN HOSPITAL - PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT

A MAN lies in the only bed- a mass of tubes casts
and traction wires sucking air through a mask Thanks
to his distinctly ruddy complexion we recognize

THE PIT-FACED THUG who cut Shingen at the funeral

The Cops share another look shrug close the door
Then we hear the sound again

Ka-chunk Ka-chunk Ka-chunk

EXT TOKYO METROPOLITAN - TEN STORIES UP - NIGHT

THE SOURCE OF THE SOUND is Logan legs dangling
sweating buckets arms strained to the breaking
point All six claws are sunken into the brick facade
of the hospital After a brief rest he tears the
left claws out and drives them back in again - slowly
scaling down the otherwise smooth wall-

KA-CHUNK KA-CHUNK KA-CHUNK - until he finds himself
dangling by the window he’s looking for He hangs
from one hand and uses the other to slice the latch

INT TOKYO METROPOLITAN HOSPITAL - PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT
CLOSE ON Pit-Face his chest rising and falling as he
struggles to breathe A hand comes into frame and gently
removes the oxygen mask from his face

Pit-Face gasps His eyes open to find Logan looming

LOGAN
Remember me

Pit-Face tires to speak to call out His hand
reaches for the remote call button but Logan takes
it away without effort

LOGAN (CONT’D)
Easy Eeeeeeasy

He puts the mask back in place and Pit-Face breathes
eyes fluttering with relief

LOGAN (CONTD)
I was hoping to avoid bettering you
but I’m fresh out of options And I
know you’re supposed to be resting

so Ill be brief Who hired you to

kill Shingen

Pit-Face manages a brave front shakes his head

LOGAN (CONT’D)
I know I know The cops asked you
a hundred times already and you
told ‘em you don’t know nothin’
But - bein’ they were cops - I’m
willing to be they didn’t say the
Magic word

Logan pulls the mask off again Pit-Face’ eyes
widen his heart monitor starts racing

LOGAN (CONT’D)
Please Tell me who hired you to
kill Shingen

SCHINK - Logan extends his claws to the tangle of tubes
connecting Pit-Face to life adding tension

LOGAN (CONT’D)
Pretty please

The heart monitor races faster taking us to-

INT APARTMENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT

- where Logan emerges from the elevator He compares the

Japanese characters on the familiar business card in his
hand to those on the name plates of each door

He finds the one he wants and notices the door is already
ajar He pushes it open and finds

INT HUMBLE APARTMENT - NIGHT

Zen lying on the floor - swollen purple track marks on his
forearm Logan rushes to him and kneels

LOGAN
Zen Ah geeze Zen Who did this
to you

Zen’s eyes are slits his voice a trembling whisper
Logan notices a hole in the floorboards Empty Zen’s

ZEN
Shingen

eyes fill with tears

ZEN (CONTD)

He took what belongs to you I
tried to resist drug too
strong I failed you So ashamed

LOGAN
Zen It was you that hired those
men to kill Shingen wasn’t it

Zen tries to resist then nods

To his amazement Zen manages a nod exhaling

Zen nods

LOGAN (CONTD)

Why

ZEN
Please

LOGAN
Why

ZEN

Shingenorderedme

LOGAN
I don’t understand Shingen wanted
the Yakuza to come after him

LOGAN (CONT’D)
Why

ZEN
The Black Black

LOGAN

The Black Clan
(thinks realizes)

He needed to prove himself in
combat Is that it Shingen wants
to be chosen He wants to be the
new Master of the Black Clan He
had to fight those men to prove
himself worthy

Logan shakes his head bitterly

Spent

LOGAN (CONTD)
And I helped him
(things a beat)
What else haven’t you told me

ZEN
Please No more I swore an
oath To my master

LOGAN
Well now you’re gonna break it The
Old Man brought me here for a
reason Zen What is it Tell me

Zen’s eyes drift to the Old Man’s portrait

ZEN
First you must remember He was a
good man an honorable man
LOGAN

Sure And then what happened

ZEN
Years ago Master of the Black
Clan wanted war Killed
those in his way Yashida came
home Japan destroyed angry
heartbroken Yashida went
looking for Master of the Clan

PUSH IN ON the portrait as Zen takes Logan back and

What do you mean you lost him

INT YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - SHINGEN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

SLAP - Yukio takes five across the eyes from Shingen bravely
straightening up for another

YUKIO
I did as you instructed I seduced
him I tried to learn his
intentions But we were attacked

SHINGEN
Attacked Attacked by whom

YUKIO
The Black Clan

SMACK - Shingen backhands her with such force Yukio
drops to her hands and knees blood trickling from
her mouth Her eyes darken “That does it”

We stay CLOSE ON her face as Shingen paces above her

SHINGEN
Idiot If it were The Black Clan
you would not be here

YUKIO
They could’ve killed us I’m sure
(pausing for effect)
Instead they gave hima gift

SHINGEN
(stops pacing)
What kind of gift

Yukio smiles to herself She’s got his full attention
now With her voice she continues to play fearful

YUKIO
A pearl A single white pearl
Perhaps it has symbolic meaning

CLOSE ON Shingen unable to hide a mix of emotions

SHINGEN
What did Logan think it meant

Yukio hesitates weighing her loyalties

SHINGEN (CONTD)
STAND AND SPEAK

YUKIO
(standing)
He he thought it was a peace
offering A sign of surrender

SHINGEN
Arrogant fool

YUKIO
Then he became angry He accused me
of betraying him Of leading him
into an ambush
(pointing to her bruised temple)
That’s when he struck me When I
woke up he was gone

Long tense moment She studies him as he states into
space wondering if he’s buying any of this Finally

SHINGEN
Logan is an animal As I said

YUKIO
Yes As you said Lord Shingen

Shingen snaps out of his thoughts locking eyes on
Yukio now Does he know she’s lying Tense pause

SHINGEN
You may call me Master

Yukio is stunned Deep emotions well up inside her

YUKIO
- Master

He puts a hand on her shoulder She flinches then
looks at his hand aching for a father But this one

SHINGEN
This information is of great value
You have done well Yukio You are
now a servant of the House Yashida

Stunned conflicted Yukio bows

YUKIO
Domo arigato Sama

Shingen waves her away She backs out of the room
wiping tears from her eyes When she is gone Shingen
turns to face the window his reflection a specter
over the whole of the port city below

SHINGEN
Him They chose him How could he
be worthy and not I How could-

SCHINK - Three blades appear across his throat - the
top one pressing tightly against his jugular Shingen
does not dare to move But he shows no fear

HE studies the blades in his reflection as they

slowly silently retract To our confusion the top
and bottom blades retract left-to-right The middle
blade retracts right to left Shingen turns to face

THE MONK and TWO MEN OF THE BLACK CLAN each holding
one knife - the blades he thought were Logan’s

SHINGEN (CONTD)
I have been expecting you
The Monk throws a punch his fist stopping just a
hair from Shingen’s nose Shingen doesn’t blink

The two men behind the Monk nod He nods in return
He turns his fist over and opens it TO REVEAL

A SINGLE BRILLIANT WHITE PEARL

Shingen inhales ever so slightly - the closest thing
to a bridal-gown gasp he’ll ever produce He extends
a hand The Monk drops the pearl in Shingen’s palm
Shingen’s eyes follow it

SHINGEN (CONTD)
I am most deeply humbled by the-

But when he looks up the Monk and his cohorts are
gone Shingen looks down at the pearl greedily

VOICE (0OS)
Master I-

Shingen shuts his fist as Yukio enters oblivious

SHINGEN
What is it Yukio

Her eyes flick to his hand as he casually places it
behind his back She bows

YUKIO
Apologies Master I came back to
ask if you wish me to find Logan
again Or are you done with him

SHINGEN
Oh by all means find him I’m not
quite done with Logan yet

CLOSE ON Yukio bows and leaves her smile fading
quickly glancing back at Shingen studying something
hidden in his palm with the wonder of a child

BLACK

And the sound of blasting steam A bright flash
Sparks A vaguely human form emerging from a tank of
water A red-hot skeleton on a steel grate Horrific

INT SMELTER - DAY

Shingen observes STEEL-WORKRERS as they pick up pieces
of the glowing skeleton with iron tongs

CLOSE ON NUMEROUS HANDS assembling the skeleton
connecting joints with wooden pegs and leather

PAN OVER TO Schematics taken form the box intended
for Logan - blueprints for the design of Logan’s own
adamantium skeleton PUSH IN ON THIS AS

A SERIES OF DISSOLVES carry us over

INT NOBURO’S BEDROOM

Mariko in a night-gown at a dressing table removing
make-up revealing the unhappy woman underneath She
looks in the mirror at

Noburo his corpulent frame lying on the bed in black
socks boxers and an undershirt snoring

INT WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Viper studies the crossbow bolt pulled from Logan’s
shoulder and the traces of dried blood there She
then consults select pages from PROJECT WOLVERINE
CLOSE ON THE HEADING

TOXINS KNOWN VULNERABILITIES

INT FORGE - NIGHT

Kenuichio carefully sharpens the edge of his sword
with a well-worn stone resting a piece of paper on
the blade and watching its own weight cut the
parchment in two Then he sharpens some more

INT YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - NIGHT

Shingen in a workout room shirtless honing his
martial arts skills on something 0OS

He hits it with hands swords spears knives the
intensity of the workout ever-increasing until we
PULL BACK TO REVEAL His practice dummy A blackened
steel copy of Logan’s skeleton - right down to his
six claws -arms raised in defense Sinewy leather
joints it together Animal-hide bladders -
representing internal organs - fill the chest cavity

Shingen learns how to avoid Logan’s indestructible
skeleton altogether From across the room he throws
a knife with stunning accuracy - the blade passing
between two ribs impaling the soft heart With a
simple short sword he charges hacking off one arm at
the elbow the other at the shoulder Then he strikes
the neck precisely finding the space between two
tightly fitted metal vertebrae and

SCHAK - “Logans” skull rolls across the floor

A winded sweating Shingen smiles Ready

INT LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

We end on Yukio staring up at the forboding Yashida
Stronghold - her home if she wants it But does she

She shakes her head as if to say she regrets what she
is about to do Then she puts her car in drive

INT GAMBLING PARLOR - NIGHT

Tracking shot through the energized chatter of a
smoke-filled late-night underground city of sin for
the international high-roller Lots of tables all of
them packed - a large bar backed by a mirrored
aquarium filled wit choral and man-o’-war jellyfish

It’s strictly jacket-and-tie Stunning women decorate
the men who can afforddon’t deserve them Big money
changes hand most of it Euro and Yuan The Oyabun
himself plays dominoes with a few minions

AT THE BAR “Sinatra” (or at least Japan’s answer
there-to) keeps one eye on the scene while fending
off numerous carnal opportunities Then she walks in

She wears a red dress cut dangerously low a slit up
one side riding scandalously high Men step aside at
her approach as if she might set them on fire One
has to admit Yukio cleans up nice

Sinatra sees her coming and quickly shoos a BRAZILIAN
BOMBSHELL off her stool

Yukio eases into the opening and offers a mind-
melting smile before whispering in his ear Sinatra’s
smile fades to disappointment He stands looks Yukio
up and down and motions for her to wait

INT BACK OFFICE - NIGHT

Sinatra enters to find Logan shuffling cards bored
A caged animal Sinatra jerks his head

SINATRA
You know this biscuit

Through the one-way glass making up the aquarium’s
mirrors back Logan sees Yukio at the bar He sighs

LOGAN
Ah hell

SINATRA
You want I should take care of her

LOGAN
You don’t mean kill her

SINATRA
I mean marry her Shes got legs up
to her neck

LOGAN
She say what she wants

SINATRA
Has information for you Wouldn’t
say what Says you’d know what it
is about just by looking at her

Through gently drifting tentacles Yukio sips a
cocktail A ring conspicuously parked on her finger
features a large white pearl

SINATRA (CONTD)
So are you two uh-

LOGAN
No

SINATRA
(smilesstraightens tie)
Got her number

LOGAN
I’m not sure I do

INT BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Sinatra shuts the door behind him leaving Yukio and Logan
alone She sits opposite from him and crosses her legs
letting the slit in her dress say hello

LOGAN
How did you find me

YUKIO
Who lese could hide you on a tiny
island full of short people

LOGAN
What do you want

YUKIO
The police aren’t the only ones
looking for you Shingen’s been
chosen by The Black Clan He knows
you have been too

LOGAN
How’d he find that out
YUKIO
Slip of the tongue
LOGAN
If I kill him you won’t have a
master
YUKIO

Who says I want him dead
Logan shakes his head and smiles She smiles back

YUKIO (CONTD)
What will you do

LOGAN
Maybe I’11l turn myself in I can do
thirty years standing on my head
Spend it watching Shingen trying to
break into jail so he can kill me

YUKIO
Hardly practical

LOGAN
But funny

She drops the cool act and leans in
YUKIO

Everyone has someone they’d like to
know was dead They may not want to
do the deed but they’d like to
know the deed was done Someone
who’s escaped justice Someone
willing to harm the innocent
Someone who cares more about power
than they do about human life

(off his blank look)
Come on Logan Master of The
Black Clan The finger of God The
power to take life with no fear of
consequence Doesn’t that tempt you
in the least

Still Logan says nothing She stands waving a
dismissive hand and turning for the door

YUKIO (CONTD)
Why do I bother Shingen is my
master now I win if you lose I
have nothing to gain by convincing
you to fight

Then she lunges kissing him deeply He might even
kiss back In ends with a bite A little anger Then

YUKIO (CONTD)
For God’s sake fight

LOGAN
Can’t do it Yukio

YUKIO
Why
(when he doesn’t answer)
Never mind I know why

She turns and opens the door TO REVEAL
MARIKO in a raincoat hiding behind big sunglasses

Logan stands stunned to see her Yukio holds a hand
out Mariko gives her a large bundle of cash Then
scoffing Yukio walks out

Alone now Logan and Mariko stare at one another for
a moment each unsure what to say Finally Mariko
takes off the shades TO REVEAL A RAISED BRUISE on her
cheek Make-up hides A SMALL CUT ON HER LIP

LOGAN
Noburo
She nods ever so slightly her lip trembling

CLOSE ON Logan A flash of rage a tide of fury
Then he takes her arm in his arms closes his eyes
exhales to the bottom of his soul whispering

LOGAN (CONTD)
It’s all right I’m here

MARIKO
I’m so sorry

LOGAN
Youre sorry What for

MARIKO
You only wanted to protect me And
I rejected you

LOGAN
I knew you’d come around

This almost makes her smile

Mariko is

MARIKO
I went to see Zen at the hospital
You may have saved his life

LOGAN
He may have saved mine

MARIKO
Yukio told me what she could Zen
said you would tell me the rest

LOGAN
You know about The Black Clan That
your father and I have been chosen
(off her nod)
Did you know your Grandfather was
the last Master of the Black Clan

shocked

LOGAN (CONT’D)
He used The Black Clan to make sure
Japan would never see another war
But someone discovered his secret
and challenged him That someone
was your father

Mariko’s hand goes to her lips
LOGAN (CONT’D)

Your Grandfather was faced with an
unthinkable dilemma To win he’d
have to kill his only son If he
lost The Black Clan would belong
to Shingen a man willing to kill
his own father for power

MARIKO
Are you saying my father
killed my grandfather

LOGAN
Your grandfather was smarter than
that No he took his own life
He deliberately left The Black Clan
without a Master

And now tears fill her eyes

LOGAN (CONT’D)
The last thing he did was mark me
for death A man he’d met only
once But a man he’d been watching
for seventy years A man he knew
better than his own son He knew
when The Black Clan faced me
Kuzuri - they would choose me as a
champion

MARIKO
But my grandfather was a good man-

LOGAN
He was a great man Cursed with a
terrible responsibility Confronted
with a terrible choice He did the
best any man could do And now he
expects me to avenge his death
To restore his family’s honor But
to do that I’d have to kill his
only son I’d have to kill your
father

Mariko considers this dilemma until she accepts the
inevitable prove her mettle

MARIKO
Then you must honor his wish

Logan is at once impressed and saddened

LOGAN
No
MARIKO
You mustn’t think of my feelings
Think of Japan My family

LOGAN
Mariko as long as I don’t face
your father The Black Clan will
have no master Japan will be free
to choose her own destiny - for
better or worse

MARIKO
MY father will hunt you for as long
as he lives

LOGAN
Then the joke’s on him

But she is not amused

LOGAN (CONT’D)
Hey I’ve been on the move for as
long as I can remember At least
now it’1ll mean something

MARIKO
Then take me with you

Logan wasn’t expecting that part His heart swells
but he stuffs it back down

LOGAN
You don’t know what you’re asking

MARIKO
(pointing to her bruised face)
Look at me I know exactly what I’m
asking

She kisses him Logan gives in taking her in his
arms She buries her head in his chest

MARIKO (CONTD)
I don’t even know you And yet

LOGAN
You know I’1l always protect you

MARTIKO
I do I do

The door opens Sinatra stops halfway through when he
sees what’s going on Just past him we see Yukio She
sees Mariko in Logan’s arms and quickly turns away
LOGAN
Were adding a passenger

SINATRA
We have plenty of room

The low bellow of a ships horn takes us to

EXT TOKYO WATERFRONT - NIGHT

Where a massive cargo freighter is casting off its
moorings and getting ready to make way

Three Mercedes sedans race to the edge of the pier
Logan Mariko and TWO YAKUZA GOONS get out of one
Sinatra Yukio and SIX GOONS get out of the others

Logan hears a thumping noise coming from the back of
Yukio’s car She tries to look innocent Logan pops
the trunk TO REVEAL

Noburo bound and gagged putting up quite a squawk
Logan glares at Yukio She shrugs
YUKIO
When I went to get Mariko he put up

a fuss so

LOGAN
Put him back

YUKIO
First thing tomorrow-

LOGAN
Tonight

Logan slams the lid He shakes hands with Sinatra
Yukio looks jealously down her nose at Mariko
Mariko behind Logan smiles back

SINATRA

If you’re ever back this way
LOGAN

Not ever
SINATRA

Then sayanora Logan-sa-

A deafening explosion of glass cuts him off

ANGLE ON SILVER SAMURAI leaping off the crushed roof of a
Mercedes drawing his sword in mid-air as

SINATRA’S EIGHT GOONS all draw weapons and fire

LOGAN
Dont—

He grabs Mariko and covers her as a hail of bullets ricochet
off of Samurai’s charged armor and kill six of the goons
before he lands Once on the ground a single sweep with his
sword takes out the other two

LOGAN (CONTD)
TAKE HER

Sinatra grabs Mariko as

SCHINK - Logan attacks Not to be out-done Yukio
kicks off her heels and with a single yank rips off
the business end of her evening gown exposing a
harness high up on each thigh filled with scalpels

Sinatra gets Mariko into a car before turning and
pulling a pistol aiming at Samurai’s back

WHAM - Samurai mule kicks him without even looking
Sinatra is out in the same instant

Logan and Samurai charge at one another colliding in
mid-air Logan has learned a lot since their last
encounter and he knows not to let his claws linger
too long We notice that his hands despite his claws
being extended are open and flat - not fists His
movements are more elegant less brutish With his
time in Japan Logan the warrior has evolved

Yukio keeps Samurai distracted She can’t do much
with strikes but she’s good with those scalpels and
Manages to get them between the plates of his armor
Not deep enough to kill but certainly painful

LOGAN (CONTD)
TAKE MARIKO AND GET OUT OF HERE

YUKIO
I STAY WITH YOU

LOGAN
YOU’RE GONNA GET YOURSELF KILLED

YUKIO
GLORIOUSLY-
WHAM - Samurai cracks her across the face and sends
her flying raising his sword to finish her off

Logan leaps onto Samurai’s back - the armor throwing
off bolts of energy and burning his flesh Logan
takes the pain grabbing the brow of the Samurai’s
helmet from behindand locking his feet into the
small of Samurai’s back Logan pushes with his feet
and pulls with his hands causing Samurai to bend
back impossibly Samurai screams in agony flailing
his sword behind him trying to stab Logan

LOGAN
GO NOW

Yukio gets to her feet runs for the Mercedes
containing Mariko as

Samurai presses a recess in the Red Sun on his chest

FOOM - A supercharged shock-wave blows Logan off his back
Logan skids across the pavement convulsing Samurai drops to
his hands and knees gasping for air He ears the Mercedes
engine starting and turns

INT MERCEDES - NIGHT
Yukio just gets the car in gear when

MARIKO
LOOK OUT

Samurai’s blade hacks horizontally through the
windshield Yukio ducks as the sword cuts off the
headrest of her car-seat She sits up again and

WHAM - A metal fist comes through the window and
knocks her out cold The car is in gear It rolls

Samurai rips off the back door and drags Mariko from
the car coming face-to face with his sister for the
first time She looks at his eyes through his visor
unafraid His eyes soften with admiration Then he
remembers himself and drags her past

Logan Just now recovering struggling to find his
feet Samurai swings Logan blocks and

SCHUNK - Logan howls in pain

CLOSE ON Samurai’s blade between Logan’s claws and
deep into the center of his hand Meanwhile
INT MERCEDES - NIGHT

Yukio come to dazed Unaware the car is moving she
opens the door and steps out landing hard The
Mercedes rolls off the pier and into the water

The trunk opens on impact REVEALING NOBURO - eyes
wide with terror - just before the trunk inhales
water and the car sinks like a stone

ANGLE ON Samurai as he kicks Logan onto his back

SAMURAI
Accept your destiny gai-jin Go to
the Stronghold Face Shingen If
not she dies

WHACK - Samurai kicks Logan under the chin snapping
his head back and knocking him out cold Mariko is
dragged away looking back at Logan as things go

WHITE GLOVED SERVANTS take down the Yashida Family
swords carrying the precious relics reverently

INT YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - NIGHT

Viper scrapes the small traces of Logan’s dried blood
from the crossbow bolt into a porcelain bowl mixing
it with a minute amounts of other compounds in a thin
glass tube distilling it over an open flame The
result

A SINGLE DROP OF BLOOD RED LIQUID The care with
which she handles it tells us it is highly lethal

LATER Viper melts pale green wax over a candle until
it is the consistency of water She adds the single
drop of red liquid to the green wax mixing it in

LATER she dips A DAGGER its blade ornately
engraved into the molten wax As it cools the wax
in the blade’s engraving appears pale green - more
like patina than lethal poison
INT YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - TEMPLE - NIGHT

Shingen prays on his hands and knees incense
burning sensing a presence Opening his eyes

Viper offers the green-bladed dagger

VIPER
One cut And you’11 kill him

Shingen shakes his head no Viper grins shrugs

VIPER (CONTD)
If all else fails

He reaches for the blade but stops himself unsure

SHINGEN
Victory without honor

VIPER
But certain victory

Now she’s got him Shingen considers this temptress
his hands hovering over her knife interrupted by

INT YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

Samurai still in his armor helmet under one arm
casts a long shadow across the floor of the grand
entrance He holds Mariko by the wrist

SAMURAI
SHIIIITINGENNNNN

SHINGEN (0S)
What is the meaning of-

Shingen emerges on the second floor balcony When he
sees Samurai’s face

SHINGEN (CONT’D)
You

SAMURAI
I have come home father

MARTIKO
Father
Mariko blinks She can tell by her father’s face that
Samurai is not speaking metaphorically Shingen
descends to greet his bastard face-to-face

SHINGEN
How dare you show your face here
How dare you lay a hand on m-

SHING - Samurai drops his helmet and draws his sword -
the tip cracking just under Shingen’s chin

SAMURAI
-my sister

SHINGEN
What do you want

SAMURAI
The animal is coming to claim her
You will face him Whoever is left
will face me and then I Will be
Master of The Black Clan

Shingen considers clearly plotting Then

SHINGEN
Very well I accept Let her go

SAMURAI
You are not the Master yet

SHINGEN
Ignorant boy I am Lord Shingen
of the House Yashida standing in
the great hall of my ancestors and
I am telling you now I will
win In fact I cannot lose

The sound of a weapon cocking OS Samurai hauls
Mariko in front of him his blade to her throat as a
figure appears at the top of the stairs

Viper aims a crossbow right at him Samurai’s eyes widen his
soul drops

SAMURAI
No

SHINGEN
You see I gave you more than you
ever knew
Viper smiles shrugs “What can I say kid” Samurai
lets Mariko go heartbroken Shingen waves to Viper
She lowers her weapon

SHINGEN (CONTD)
The boy has too much potential
(to Samurai)
It would be a shame to waste it

EXT YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - FRONT GATE - NIGHT
Logan and Yukio arrive in her car Guards merely
glance at them before letting them pass

EXT YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - TREELINE - NIGHT

A treeline at the edge of the property Nothing
remarkable Until A PAIR OF EYES OPENS

The Monk is standing right in front of us He is
watching the car head toward the stronghold

INT YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

The house is still Dark Eerie Logan enters
inhaling deeply through his nose

LOGAN
This way

EXT JAPANESE GARDEN - NIGHT

A full moon casts cold blue light over a magnificent
garden complete with ponds bridges pagodas - like a
painted backdrop fora grand staging of the Mikado

Ground lights come on one by one illuminating a
light mist in the trees simultaneously making the
landscape more visible and creepy The last light
illuminates the open center of the garden and

MARIKO more worried for Logan than herself Logan
takes half a step Yukio grabs his arm stopping him

YUKIO
Just wait

Shingen and Viper step out from the shadows on one
side of her Silver Samurai steps out from the other
ANGLE ON The Monk draped in shadow looking down
from atop the high garden wall Watching Waiting

SHINGEN
Are you ready to face your destiny

LOGAN
Sure why not

SHINGEN
Then come forward

LOGAN
Mariko leaves with Yukio first

SAMURAI
She leaves when I am satisfied

Logan sighs whispers to Yukio

LOGAN
Is everybody here such a blowhard

She shrugs “pretty much” Logan approaches his
opponents as they form a wall in front of Mariko

Shingen wears a robe bearing the Yashida symbol - the
family’s two swords in the sash around his waist

EXTREME CLOSE-UP AS He reaches inside his robe
adjusting the POISON DAGGER PREPARED BY VIPER He
took the dishonorable option after all

Logan stops a few yards from Shingen Yukio just
behind him Logan and Viper make eye contact - the
first time since their lethal encounter at Noburo’s

LOGAN (CONT’D)
Don’t you get around

She shrugs smiles Samurai bristles at the remark
SHINGEN
(to Yukio)

You may go

YUKIO
I stay with Logan

SHINGEN
Then you’ll die with him
YUKIO
Better I die serving him than live
serving you

LOGAN
Now now we’re all friends here

SAMURAI
Kill this dog Shingen

LOGAN

(re Samurai)
Look at this vulture waiting to
feast on the leftovers

(to Shingen)
What say we team this punk Then
you and me can settle up as the
main event

SAMURAI
(drawing his sword)
IMPUDENT-—
SHINGEN
ENOUGH

Samurai freezes humiliated Yukio laughs Viper
shakes her head embarrassed for Samurai

SHINGEN (CONTD)

(to Logan)
I expected you to bring dishonor to
this affair

(to Samurai)
But you Where is your dignity

(back to Logan)
You think you can turn y our
opponents against one another and
steal a victory As a man with no
interest in the prize at stake
that is your advantage

Logan smiles at Samurai

LOGAN
He’s smarter than you

SHINGEN
Pick up your weapon

That’s when Logan sees an object on the ground a few
feet in front of Shingen Old Man Yashida’s sword
SHINGEN (CONTD)
An appropriate choice I thought

LOGAN
I wont be needing it thanks

SCHINK

SHINGEN
I had hoped we could fight man-to-
man Not man-to mechanism

Logan considers this

YUKIO
(quietly to herself)
Don’t dooo iiiit

LOGAN
Y’arright

SCNICK - his claws retract

LOGAN (CONT’D)
Man-to-man

MARIKO

SHINGEN
I have your word of honor then

LOGAN
For what it’s worth

Logan hooks a toe under the scabbard and kicks the
sword up into his hands He draws the blade and
inspects the weapon he first saw seventy years ago

Shingen slowly draws the ancient blade of his family
placing the flat side reverently to his head After a
short prayer he holds the sword in both hands
getting into position with a flourish

Logan just stands there Sword at his side Pause

SHINGEN
Begin

Shingen attacks Mariko gasps In a flash Logan
brings his sword up one-handed blocking a strike
aimed right for his neck
Shingen steps back waits Strikes again Again
Logan blocks him then lets the sword hang

Shingen adjusts moving in combinations of blows
rather than single precise strikes Again Logan
manages to block The energy of the fight leaves one
with the impression of a train leaving the station
gaining in speed and intensity steel on steel
hitting faster and faster Logan grips the sword with
both hands now his form matching Shingen’s until
blades collide five times a second and still

Shingen cannot hit Logan

Shingen stops steps back a little winded the
blades ringing in a long sustained chord

Viper is in awe Samurai is impatient Mariko
trembles And Yukio smiles

Shingen screams and attacks with renewed ferocity
Logan’s blade responds ass if magnetized meeting
Shingen’s no matter what direction it comes from

ANGLE ON The Monk expressionless emotionless
watching from high atop the garden wall Keener eyes
will notice two more Men of the Clan are with him

Shingen stops again frustrated

YUKIO
You can’t hit him

LOGAN
I told you I was built to learn
And you’re one hell of a Sensei

SAMURAI
(to Logan)
Finish him then
LOGAN
No
SAMURAI
Kill or be killed That is the
contest
LOGAN

Stuff your contest I won’t kill
him And he can’t kill me

(to Shingen)
Take as long as you like baldy I
got all the time in the world
No more composure Shingen freaks- charging at Logan
with everything he has Logan moves back sideways
around absorbing every move in Shingen’s arsenal
The Lord of the House Yashida is reduced to a primal
shrieking maniac Logan is the picture of calm Then

SNAP

Time stops Shingen holds up his family sword the
blade snapped in two He throws it draws his short
sword and goes after Logan again But now it’s just
sad Logan has reach on him Shingen can’t win

SHINGEN
(to Samurai)
Together We take him together

Samurai cannot hide his surprise

SAMURAI
That is not the-

SHINGEN
They can choose another champion

LOGAN
(to Shingen re Samurai)
Sooner or later you’ll have to face
him And having fought you both I
gotta say The kid’s got you beat
Shingen What with all that armor

SAMURAI

I’LL FIGHT HIM WITH MY BARE HANDS
LOGAN

Big man
SHINGEN

Kenuichio presents no real threat

to me

SAMURAI LOGAN
I don’t He doesn’t

SHINGEN (CONTD)
I’m your father Kenuichio Kill me
and what will you be Master of The
Black Clan Perhaps But what name
What house You will still be
living in the shadow Without a
father to call your son you are
and always will be nothing

CLOSE ON Samurai - the eyes behind his mask show he’s been
hit on a gut level

SAMURAI
I am nothing now What difference
does it make

SHINGEN
Swear your loyalty to me Here and
now I will acknowledge you as my
son I will name you my successor

Mariko is stunned Samurai slowly removes his helmet to
better hear words he has waited for all his life

SAMURAI
And The Black Clan

SHINGEN
You will swear off any claim to The
Black Clan until I am dead and
gone Then you will earn the right
to be chosen just as I have done
You will fight for your father’s
prize just as I do now With a
champion Chosen by The Clan

LOGAN
Use your head kid He’s sucking
you in Don’t do it

SHINGEN
The Empire my father left will be
nothing compared to the one I leave
you I will extend the shadow of
The Black Clan until it covers the
Earth Bow to me and in time it
will all be yours

Samurai considers things very carefully Logan
grimaces He’s in the shit now After a beat

SAMURAI
I accept your terms Father

Shingen smiles Logan wince nods to Shingen

LOGAN
Well played

SAMURAI
On one condition
LOGAN
Uh oh

SAMURAI
I must have a guarantee

SHINGEN
I give you my word of honor What
better guarantee is there

SAMURAI
The word you gave to my mother
Before she killed herself Your
word means nothing to me I pledge
my sword to you here and now
father But I must be the sole
heir to the House Yashida The sole
living heir

All eyes shift to Mariko now Terrified she looks to Logan
then to Shingen He looks at his daughter with deep pity a
tinge of regret Then he sizes up Samurai Logan his overall
chances

SHINGEN
Very well

MARIKO
Father-

SHINGEN
Kill her

In a flash Samurai turns his blade on Mariko
In that same instant Logan attacks Samurai
In that same instant Shingen attacks Logan

LOGAN
LITTLE HELP HERE

Yukio springs into action Viper cuts her off
drawing the knife she sued on Logan that familiar
amber oil dripping from the blade Yukio forgoes
weapons of any kind and sticks with hand-to-hand

Five bodies dance around Mariko in a blur of blades
fists and feet Logan is taking hits now fighting a
two front war - Shingen trying to hit his vitals
Samurai trying to get past him to kill Mariko The
resulting frustration leads to anger anger turns to
rage His rage boils over and Logan goes completely
totally utterly
Berserk

Logan swings his sword at Samurai’s chest the blade
exploding like glass Samurai’s armor holds but the
force of the blow momentarily staggers him as

Shingen swings his blade at Logan’s neck for the
kill To his horror Logan spins and catches the
speeding blade with his bare hands It cuts his
flesh but not his adamantium bones Meanwhile

Samurai closes on Logan from behind distracted when

Yukio throws a roundhouse kick to the side of Viper’s
head dropping her before firing a scalpel at
Samurai slicing his cheek Enraged Samurai attacks
Yukio She just barely stays ahead of his sword as

Logan grips Shingen’s glade feeling no pain
enraged Shingen is scared of him now He lets his
sword go with one hand and reaches into his robe
PULLING OUT THE GREEN DAGGER THE DEATH BLOW

But as he lashes out with the dagger Logan tears the
sword from Shingen’s grasp and clubs him over the
head with the handle Shingen goes down

CLOSE ON The green dagger tumbles into the grass as

Logan throws Shingen’s sword the adamantium visible
through his flayed palms Samurai sees his moment

Forgetting Yukio he stabs Logan in the back Logan
screams and turns striking the sizzling blade with
his elbow and ripping it from Samurai’s hand The
blade stays wedged in Logan’s body crackling

Viper staggers to her feet and lunges at Yukio Yukio
catches her They Grapple for Viper’s knife as

Logan roars and kicks Samurai square in the chest
Samurai’s heavy armor adds to his momentum and he
stagers back and falls as

Viper sweeps Yukio’s legs and drives her to the
ground jumping on top of her and coming down with
the knife in both hands as

Logan turns to Mariko

LOGAN (CONTD)
PULL IT OUT DO IT
He turns his back to her Mariko can’t bring herself
to touch the weapon

CLOSE ON A drop of poison dangles from the tip of
Viper’s trembling blade just above Yukio’s eye As

Samurai gets to his feet and heads for Logan

LOGAN (CONTD)
DO IT DO IT NOW

Mariko tears the blade from Logan’s back In one
fluid motion he spins snatches the sword from her
hand and comes back around to meet Samurai

WA-CRACK - The charged blade hits the charged armor
Samurai and Logan are both blasted back The
resulting waist-high shock-wave of energy knocks
Mariko flat and blasts Viper off of Yukio

Silence

Samurai - his armor no longer charged - is the first
to stir shaken and dazed but protected by his own
armor from real harm Logan meanwhile struggles to
sit up overwhelmed by his wounds

Samurai hauls him up by his neck

WHACK - Enraged he punches Logan with his armored
fist over and over squeezing Logan’s throat with
his other hand Logan’s neck snaps back repeatedly
until

SCHUNK - A scream of agony Samurai drops on his
knees clutching the upper half of his right arm

Q

LOSE ON The severed forearm of Samurai’s glimmering
armor lying in the grass

CLOSE ON Samurai’s sword still clutched in Logan’s
hand That is until Logan throws it

LOGAN (CONT’D)
Maybe now you can teach

MARIKO
LOGAN

He turns but too late

SCHUNK - And Logan gasps PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Shingen his broken family sword buried up to the
hilt in Logan’s belly He savors it pulls the blade
out and lets Logan drop down on all fours

Logan is badly wounded unable to get up Shingen
stands over him triumphant He rests his sword on
the back of Logan’s neck much like his father did
seventy years ago marking his spot

SHINGEN
One just needs to beprecise

He raises the sword to strike and

Yukio attacks him Shingen senses her coming turns
and back-hands her Yukio is out cold

Shingen raises the sword above his head Logan is too
weak to resist Then Shingen freezes His face
changing when he sees

SHADOWS moving at the top of the garden wall Dozens
of them rising one by one Silent More shadows
emerge from the garden Suddenly they are surrounded
on all sides not by some Men of the Black Clan but
all of them Hundreds Watching silently Waiting

ANGLE ON Mariko coming to seeing her father over
Logan ready to behead him She looks around sees a
dagger in the grass She grabs it Meanwhile

SHINGEN (CONTD)

In the end Logan-san you were
worthy

MARIKO
Father-

He turns catching Mariko’s hand before she can stab
him She twists her wrist and shakes the dagger from
her grasp Then he shoves her back He turns quickly
to finish the job taking the sword in both hands

AND NOTICES A SMALL CUT ON THE BACK OF HIS HAND -
superficial really - between his thumb and
forefinger A trace of pale green He sees the green
dagger in the grass The dagger Mariko was holding

His hand trembles convulses The skin blisters and
bubbles The bubbles crawl up his arm under his
robe He drops his sword puts a hand to his throat
as his blood boils As his eyes turn bright red

And Shingen collapses Dead

Mariko rushes to Logan as Yukio comes to She crawls over to
Viper lying face down on the ground Yukio rolls her over
Viper has fallen on her own knife

Mariko helps Logan to his feet as his wounds slowly heal
Meanwhile The Black Clan slowly gathers around him As
always without a sound

At the front of the mass of assassins is the Monk He kneels
before Logan and the others do the same It is a solemn
moment

SAMURAI
(through bitter tears)
You have been chosen You are
Master of the Black Clan

LOGAN
But I didn’t kill him
(to the Monk)
I didn’t kill Shingen Mariko did
No winner no master

The Monk just bows solemnly waiting
SAMURAI

You have been chosen Logan They
await your command

LOGAN
No I don’t want this I didn’t ask
for it

YUKIO

Then don’t give them a command
What difference does it make

LOGAN

(re Shingen and Samurai)
Look at them There’ll always be a
challenger I’1l be the one who has
to kill them One day one of them
will win Maybe someone even worse
than Shingen No I won’t do it

(to Yukio)
Take Mariko Get her out of here

Mariko holds on to him

MARIKO
What about you

LOGAN
I’m gonna deal with them
Mariko sees too many killers to count Logan and the
Monk share a look an understanding between warriors

MARIKO
No Logan please

LOGAN
Theyre a curse Mariko Theyve
been a cruse on your people for two
thousand years It ends tonight

MARIKO
Logan-

LOGAN
Do as I say Please Go

Mariko knows there is no convincing Logan Yukio
takes her by the arm and leads her away

MARIKIO’S POV of Logan standing at the center of an

army of Assassins who live only to kill Samurai
rocks gently on his knees a few feet away clutching
what’s left of his arm his instrument

ANGLE ON Logan and the Monk staring at one another

The Monk seems to read Logan’s mind The Monk nods

INT YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - NIGHT

Mariko and Yukio are crossing the grand entrance
headed for the front door when a sound OS stops
them in their tracks - countless voices screaming at
once A war-cry to chill the blood

MARIKO
LOGAN

And then silence Mariko’s eyes fill with tears
Yukio cannot hide her sympathy They share a look of
deep sadness and walk out

EXT YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

Mariko helps Yukio into the car and shuts the door
walking around to the other side She gasps

ANGLE ON Logan standing in the doorway of the
stronghold not a scratch on him He walks toward
Mariko She runs to him They embrace Then

MARIKO
What did you do

LOGAN
Im Master of the Black Clan I
spoke They obeyed

MARIKO
What did you say

LOGAN

Seppuku
EXT YASHIDA STRONGHOLD - GARDEN - NIGHT
The ground is littered with bodies - Assassins in
black lie everywhere each man with a sword in his
chest Each man dead by his own hand
At the center of it sits Silver Samurai Kenuichio
He takes in the bodies of the men he’d hoped to lead
the father he’d hoped to honor and the woman he’d
been seduced into serving all dead
And he sobs as though he might never stop
CLOSE ON A green bladed dagger in the grass
waiting to be found
EXT STREETS OF TOKYO - NIGHT
A familiar explosion of unearthly color blinding
light Our eyes adjust to a world of flashing neon
and LED One giant ever changing video screen
INT MERCEDES - NIGHT
Logan in back Sinatra and Yukio in front Logan
looks out at the city rolling past a familiar face
on every television

His own Logan is still a wanted man

The low bellow of a ship’s horn takes us to

EXT TOKYO WATERFRONT - NIGHT

Logan Sinatra and Yukio stand at the bottom of a
gangway to a massive cargo ship in a dense fog

Logan is anxious The ship’s horn blasts Sinatra
checks his watch

SINATRA
It’s time

LOGAN
Where is she

The ship’s horn blasts again

SINATRA
Logan

Just then the headlights of an approaching car slice
the dense fog Logan sighs walks toward it as a lone
figure gets out Logan is confused when he sees

LOGAN
Zen

He’s looking a little worse for wear but well enough

ZEN
Apologies for the delay I wanted
to be here to say goodbye

Logan is touched Another figure emerges from the fog
Mariko as stunning as ever He extends a hand

LOGAN
Ship’s leaving come on

MARIKO
I’m not going

Stunned pause Zen bends his head Yukio and Sinatra
share a look

LOGAN
Mariko-

MARIKO
I am the sole heir of my family I
have a duty A responsibility I

cannot go And you cannot stay
(touching his cheek)
Perhaps one day when I can make

people see the truth

But that’s a long way off She kisses him gently

MARIKO (CONTD)
I will never forget you I will
never forget what you have done for
my family For this country

He just stares at her the pain in his eyes is too much for
her Her eyes fill with tears

MARIKO (CONTD)
Dream of me Kuzuri

And despite himself despite his pain Logan wipes the look
away and says the only thing he can

LOGAN
Goodbye Mariko

They kiss again Yukio looks away Sinatra puts a comforting
hand on her shoulder

Mariko turns and walks back to the car wiping tears from her
eyes as the fog swallows her Logan turns to Zen who holds a
familiar object in the hands

THE BOX left to him by Yashida The box containing the
mystery of his identity

ZEN
The answers you seek

Logan mumbles something inaudible

ZEN (CONTD)
What

LOGAN
He said ‘honor the gift I was
given’ The Old Man saved my life
I repaid him by killing his son
(re box)
I havent earned this Zen

ZEN
After all this time you still
don’t understand Inside that box
are the answers to all of your

questions Except the answer to
the only question that truly
matters

LOGAN

Which is
ZEN
What happens now
(pointing to the box)
Honor the gift you were given

Logan looks at the box and realizes

LOGAN
What was done to me What I am

ZEN
Is a blessing Not a curse
LOGAN
It doesn’t matter how I came to be
what I am It only matters what I
do with it
ZEN
(smilesnods )

The lesson has ended
As if on cue the ship’s horn blows again

SINATRA
Logan you have to go

LOGAN
Goodbye Zen

ZEN
I will say Until we meet again

Zen smiles bows and leaves Logan heads for the
gangway Yukio tries to not run after him She tries
not to get in his way But she’s Yukio

She runs blocking his path standing on to the
bottom of the step of the gangway as it slowly rises

YUKIO
You would leave me without a
master

LOGAN

It’s time to be on your own

Perhaps for the first time in her life Yukio is
speechless considering the unthinkable Logan takes
her hand easing her off the gangway and stepping on

LOGAN (CONTD)
And who knows You might even end
up the one in charge

He says this wit ha nod to Sinatra waiting anxiously
for Logan to leave And Yukio to stay

YUKIO
Remember me Logan-sama

LOGAN
How could I possibly forget

She smiles Logan smiles back Then they lose one
another in the fog

EXT PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT

MOVING SWIFTLY over dark water turning white We are
in the wake of a ship heading to sea

We spy something in the water and slow to take a
look A single sheet of yellowed parchment floating
on the surface slowly dissolving the words no
longer legible No longer important

We move on finding more pages - hundreds of them -
the story of a man being untold forgotten And then
we reach the beginning

A MASSIVE FREIGHTER the YASHIDA MARV leads toward a
fog-bank over calm seas horizon unseen

We find a man in battered leather on the stern
smoking a cigar looking back at the fading lights of
Tokyo shrouded in mist like a vague memory

The man holds a box in his hands The box with the
answers to the riddle of his past But his past
doesn’t matter anymore Only his future

He takes one last sheet of parchment from the box
reads it carefully and tosses it into the sea
