your hopes up Your brother
doesnt even know you exist

Julius gets in the boat and casts off The boat takes off
like a streak Julius in perfect rhythm increases the
pace The boat is almost flying across the water

disappears in the

known there was something missing
in my life And deep down Im

metal cots He points to a cot near the door and smiles
fondly
JULIUS
And thats where he must have
slept

MOTHER SUPERIOR

when he created Vincent Benedict

chess or poetry

is a photograph which falls to her desk
MOTHER SUPERIOR

Thats odd the contents of his

Dear Sister Anderson your request

Benedict has been denied
According to our files his mother
did not die during birth We have
a current address for her at 172

simple abandonment and as such he

is inelligible for aid

Vince snatches the paper back

May I ask you a question
(a beat concerned)

Why do you keep referring to her
in the past tense

GARDENER
Because she passed away some time
ago

They look like theyve been kicked in the stomach
