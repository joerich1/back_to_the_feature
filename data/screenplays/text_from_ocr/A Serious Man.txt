White letters on a black screen

-RASHI

FADE IN

AGAINST BLACK SNOWFLAKES

The flakes drift lazily down toward us Our angle looks

up
Now an angle looking steeply down the snow falls not quite

away to collect on a
foreground chimneypot and on the little shtetl street that

maplike below us
It is night and quiet and the street is deserted except

one man who walks away from
us his valenki squeaking in the fresh snow He carries

branches on one shoulder
and has a hatchet tucked into his belt
We cut down to street level The man walks toward us

and bundled against the
cold Smiling he mutters in Yiddish-the dialogue subtitled
voice

enters

MAN
What a marvel what a marvel

HOUSE INTERIOR
As its door opens and the man enters

Dora

VOICE
Yes

The man crosses to the stove with his bundle of wood The

continues

Can you help me with the ice
The man dumps the wood into a box by the stove as his wife

with an ice pick
I expected you hours ago

MAN

You cant imagine what just happened I was coming back

on the Lublin road when the wheel came off the cart

thank heavens it was the way back and Id already sold the
geese

WIFE
How much
to

stare

MAN
Fifteen groshen but thats not the story I was struggling

set the cart upright when a droshky approaches from the
direction of Lvov How lucky you think that someone is
out this late

WIFE
Yes very remarkable

MAN

But thats the least of it He stops to help me we talk of
this we talk of that-it turns out this is someone you know
Traitle Groshkover

His wife stares at him as he beams

He takes the stare as a sign that she cant place the name
You know REB GROSHKOVER Pesel Bunims uncle

The chacham from Lodz who studied under the Zohar reb

in Krakow

Still she stares Then quietly

WIFE
God has cursed us

What

WIFE
Traitle Groshkover has been dead for three years

Laughter erupts from the man but as his wife continues to
at him he strangles on it

Quiet
Wind whistles under the eaves
sound

creaks

with

delight

The man says quietly

MAN
Why do you say such a thing I saw the man I talked to him

WIFE

You talked to a dybbuk Traitle Groshkover died of typhus
in Pesel Bunims house Pesel told me-she sat shiva for
him

They stare at each through a silence broken only by the

of the quickening wind

A rap at the door

Neither immediately responds
Finally to her husband

Who is it

For some soup to warm himself
The wind moans He helped me Dora

THE DOOR
We are looking in from the outside as it unlatches and

in opened by the husband

in the foreground who has arranged his face into a strained
look of greeting In the

background the wife stares hollow-eyed

MAN
REB GROSHKOVER You are welcome here
Reverse on REB GROSHKOVER a short merry-looking fellow

a bifurcated beard and a
silk hat and spectacles He gives a little squeal of
REB GROSHKOVER
You are too kind Velvel Too kind

He steps into the house and sees the wife staring at him
And you must be Dora So much I have heard of you

Yes your cheeks are pink and your legs are stout What a
wife you have

The husband chuckles nervously

MAN
Yes A ray of sun a ray of sun Sit

WIFE
My husband said he offered you soup

REB GROSHKOVER
Yes but I couldnt possibly eat this late or Id have
nightmares No no no soup for me

WIFE
I knew it

REB GROSHKOVER laughs
REB GROSHKOVER

I see You think Im fat enough already

He settles chuckling into his chair but Dora remains
sober

WIFE
No A dybbuk doesnt eat

REB GROSHKOVER stares at her shocked

The wife returns the stare

The husband looks from wife to REB GROSHKOVER apprehensive
A heavy silence

REB GROSHKOVER bursts into pealing laughter

REB GROSHKOVER
What a wife you have

He wipes away tears of merriment the husband relaxes even
begins
to smile

MAN

I assure you REB GROSHKOVER its nothing personal she
heard a story you had died three years ago at Pesel
Bunims house This is why she think you are a dybbuk I
of course do not believe in such things I am a rational
man

REB GROSHKOVER is still chuckling

REB GROSHKOVER

Oh my Oh my yes What nonsense And even if there
were spirits certainly

He thumps his chest

I am not one of them

WIFE

Pesel always worried Your corpse was left unattended for
many minutes when Pesels father broke shiva and left the
room-it must have been then that the Evil One-

She breaks off to spit at the mention of the Evil One
-took you
her

across

REB GROSHKOVER is terribly amused

REB GROSHKOVER
My corpse Honestly What a wife you have

WIFE

Oh yes Look husband

She steps forward to the Reb who looks enquiringly up at
They were preparing the body Pesels father shaved

one check

As his eyes roll down to look at her hand she draws it
his smooth right cheek

Then he left the room He came back and shaved the
other

She reaches across to the other cheek REB GROSHKOVERs eyes
following her hand-
You were already gone

-and drags her hand across A bristly sound

REB GROSHKOVER laughs

REB GROSHKOVER
I shaved hastily this morning and missed a bit-by you this
makes me a dybbuk
the

moves

He appeals to the husband

Its true I was sick with typhus when I stayed with
Peselle but I recovered as you can plainly see and now
I-hugh

The wife steps back
REB GROSHKOVER looks slowly down at his own chest in which

wife has just planted an

ice pick

REB GROSHKOVER stares at the ice pick
The wife stares

The husband stares

Suddenly REB GROSHKOVER bursts out laughing
What a wife you have

The husband can manage only a shocked whisper

MAN
Woman what have you done
REB GROSHKOVER again looks down at his chest which again

him to laughter He
shakes his head

REB GROSHKOVER
Why would she do such a thing

He looks up
I ask you Velvel as a rational man which of us is
possessed

WIFE
and

What do you say now about spirits He is unharmed

REB GROSHKOVER
On the contrary I dont feel at all well

And indeed blood has begun to soak through his vest
He chuckles with less energy
One does a mitzvah and this is the thanks one gets

MAN
Dora Woe woe How can such a thing be

REB GROSHKOVER
Perhaps I will have some soup I am feeling weak

He rises to his feet but totters
Or perhaps I should go

He smiles weakly at Dora

One knows when one isnt wanted

He walks unsteadily to the door opens it with some effort

staggers out into the
moaning wind and snow to be swallowed by the night
The wife and husband stare at the door banging in the wind

FINALLY

MAN
Dear wife We are ruined Tomorrow they will discover
the body All is lost
against

WIFE

Nonsense Velvel

She walks to the door

Blessed is the Lord Good riddance to evil and shuts it

the wind

BLACK
A drumbeat thumps in the black
Music blares the Jefferson Airplane Grace Slicks voice

When the truth is found to be lies
And all the hope inside you dies
Dont you want somebody to love

An image fades in slowly but even up full it is dim some

of round dull white shape
with a small black pinhole center This white half-globe is

plug set in a flesh-toned
field The flesh tone glows translucently backlit We are

toward the white plug
and as we do so the music grows louder still

AN EARPIECE

A pull back-a reverse on the preceding push in-from the

white plastic earpiece

of a transistor radio The Jefferson Airplane continues over
the cut but becomes

extremely compressed The pull back reveals that the

is lodged in someones
ear and trails a white cord
As

classroom

book

We drift down the cord to find the radio at its other end

we do so we hear live in the
room many voices speaking a foreign language in unison A

apparently
The radio is on a desktop but hidden from in front by the

held open before it The

book is written in non-Roman characters
We are in Hebrew school

The boy who is listening to the transistor radio-DANNY

Gopnik-sits

occupied

is

and

With

up

veined

through

at a hinge-topped
desk in a cinderblock classroom whose rows of desks are

by other boys and
girls of about twelve years of age It is dusk and the room

flourescent-lit
At the front of the room a gray-haired man in a worn suit

tie addresses the class
DANNY straightens one leg so that he may dig into a pocket

an eye on the TEACHER to
make sure he isnt being watched he eases something out
A twenty-dollar bill

TEACHER
Mee yodayah Reuven Rifkah Mah zeh anakim
Efsheh mashooach ba-avodah

A BLINDING LIGHT
At the cut to the light the Jefferson Airplane music jumps

full The light resolves into
a multi-flared image of a blinking eye
Reverse the inside of a human ear Fleshy whorls finely

a cavity receding to
dark
Objective on the DOCTORs office the DOCTOR is peering
a lightscope into the ear of
an early-middle-aged man LARRY Gopnik
The Jefferson Airplane music continues

The TEACHER talking

A bored child staring off

His point-of-view a blacktopped parking lot with a few

school busses beyond it a

marshy field and distant suburban bungalows

Close on another child staring at something through drooping
eyelids

His point-of-view very close on the face of a classroom

We hear its electrical
hum Its red sweep-second hand crawls around the dial very

slowly
DANNY Gopnik hisses

DANNY
Fagle
The TEACHER drones on writing on the blackboard DANNYs

flit from the TEACHER to
the student sitting kitty-corner in front of him-a husky

with shaggy hair He
hasnt heard the prompt
Fagle
The TEACHER turns from the blackboard and DANNY leans back

front folding the
twenty up small behind his book
TEACHER

Ahnee rotzeh lalechet habait hakisai Mee yodayah

He interrupts himself briefly to make a couple of phlegm-
hawking
sounds He resumes
Hamrah oomoh meshiach oomshel zal

DOCTORS OFFICE

The DOCTOR palpates LARRYs midriff digging his fingers
into

the hairy baggy flesh

DOCTORs Voice

Uh-huh Well do some routine X-rays

X-RAY CONE
A huge white rubberized cone pointed directly at us
We hear a rush of static and the DOCTORs voice filtered

a talk-back

DOCTORs Voice

Hold still

Wider LARRY is in his shorts lying on his back on an

table covered by a sheet
of tissue paper The X-ray cone is pointed at the middle of

body
There is a brief sci-fi-like machine hum It clicks off

cigarette

Nefsheh shelach hamilamid-eh
The TEACHERs circuit of the classroom has taken him around

DANNY DANNYs

book lies face-down on the desk covering the radio but the
white cord snakes out from

under it up to his ear

The TEACHER yanks at the cord

The cord pops out of its jack and the Jefferson Airplane

tinnily from beneath the
book of torah stories
The TEACHER lifts the book to expose the jangling radio
Outraged the TEACHER projects above the music

Mah zeh Mah zeh
Some of the students are singing along a couple beat rhythm
on their desks

Shechet talmidim Anachnoo lo cam zeh bbait sefer
Shechet bivakasha
Three other students join in a chorus

STUDENTS

Shechet Shechet bivakasha

The nodding students head droops ever lower
Other students join in the chant

SHECHET SHECHET SHECHET BIVAKASHA

The nodding students chin finally reaches and settles on

chest and he gives a long
snorfling inhale of sleep

DOCTORS OFFICE
LARRY now fully clothed is seated across from the DOCTOR
The DOCTOR is looking at his file He absently taps a
aged

and

identifies

out of a pack and lights up
He nods as he smokes looking at the file

DOCTOR
Well I-sorry
He holds the pack toward LARRY

LARRY
No thanks

DOCTOR

The DOCTOR takes a long suck

TINTED PHOTO PORTRAIT
The portrait old in an ornate gilt frame is of a middle-

rabbi with a small neat
mustache and round spectacles He wears a tallis hood-style

a phylactery box is
strapped to his forehead A plaque set into the frame

the man as Rabbi Minda
Wider shows that the portrait hangs in the Hebrew school

principals

cinderblock room It is quiet The only sound is a deep

electrical

low

not

thick

between

hum
Just visible behind the principals desk upon which is a

stack of books and a name

plate identifying the occupant as MAR TURCHIK is the top of
a mans head-an old

man with a few whispy white hairs where his yarmulka is

DANNY seated opposite pushes up from his slouch to better

across the desk
We boom up to show more of the principal He is short He

a white shirt and
hoist-up pants that come to just below his armpits He has

eyeglasses He fiddles
with the transistor radio muttering

PRINCIPAL
Hmm eh nu

He experiments with different dials on the radio
DANNY nervously watches

DANNY
You put the-
The old man holds up one hand

PRINCIPAL
n ivrit (In Hebrew)

DANNY
Um
The old man looks down at the little earpiece pinched

two fingers He examines
it as a superstitious native might a Coca-Cola bottle
The source of the electrical hum a wall clock whose red

sweep-second

hand crawls
around the dial very very slowly
The Reb continues to squint at the earpiece
DANNY sighs He encourages

DANNY
Yeah you-
The principals tone is harder

PRINCIPAL

In ivrit

This time his cold look holds until he is sure that the
admonishment

has registered

He looks back down at the earpiece

We hear the door open The principal ignores it

An old woman walks slowly in with a teacup chattering on a

saucer

She has thick

eyeglasses She wears thick flesh-colored support hose She
takes

slow short steps

toward the desk The principal is studying the radio

PRINCIPAL

Mneh

The old woman continues to take slow short steps toward him

The tableau looks like a

performance-art piece

She reaches the desk and sets the teacup down She summons a

couple of phlegm-

hawking rasps and turns to go

She takes slow short steps toward the door

The principal raises the earpiece experimentally toward his
ear

Close on his hairy wrinkled ear as his trembling fingers

bring

in the earpiece The

i £f ngers push and wobble and tamp the earpiece into place
hesitate

and then do some
more pushing and wobbling and tamping
The principal keeps DANNY fixed with a stare as his hand

hesitantly

drops from his ear

ready to reach back up should the earpiece loosen
-mneh

Satisfied that neither the student nor the earpiece are

about

to make any sudden moves he

looks down at the radio He turns a dial

Faintly and tinnily from the earpiece we hear the compressed

jangle of rock music The

rabbi stares blankly listening

DANNY slumps looking warily at the rabbi

The rabbi continues to stare down at the radio The
compressed

rock music jangles on

The rabbi is expressionless mouth slightly open listening

Tableau anxious student earplugged spiritual leader

Muffled from the outer office the hawking of phlegm

CLASSROOM

We are behind a man who writes equations on a chalkboard
shoulder

quickly waggling Periodically he glances back giving us a
fleeting

look at his face it is

LARRY

(SURPRISED)
You understand the dead cat

CLIVE nods gravely
But you you cant really understand the physics

without understanding the math The math tells how it
really works Thats the real thing the stories I give you

FADE IN

LARRY has fallen asleep at the kitchen table face-down in a
pile of blue books Cold blue

light sweeps across him and he looks up

A short balding middle-aged man in flannel pyjamas and an

flannel dressing gown

stands in front of the open refrigerator holding an open jar
of orange juice He tips the jar

back to drink his free hand holding a balled-up towel to

back of his neck
LARRY stares at him

CLOSE ON A TONE ARM
A hand lays it onto a slowly spinning vinyl record
Through scratches and pops a solo tenor starts a mournful

chant
Close on the sleeve
Rabbi Youssele Rosenblatt Chants Your Haftorah Portion

VOLUME 12
Rabbi Youssele wears a caftan and a felt hat and has sad

They peer out from the
dark beard that covers most of the rest of his face like

eyes peering out of the
woods
Wider on DANNY in his bedroom evening He lifts the tone

on the portable

turntable

He chants the passage

He drops the tone arm at the same place Rabbi Youssele

the passage again
DANNY listens eyes narrowed He lifts the tone arm and

the passage again
He replays the passage again before he can lift the tone
calling

She hits DANNY on the back of the head

DANNY

LARRY
SARAH Whats going on

DANNY
She keeps doing that

LATER
LARRY sits in a reclining chair in the living room head

listening to Sidor Belarsky on
the hi-fi On top of the music is a hissing-sucking sound

is also the sound of a
pencil busily scratching paper

We cut to its source Uncle Arthur sits scribbling into a

notebook his free hand

window

face

holding the end of a length of surgical tubing against the

of his neck The tube leads
to a water-pik-like appliance on an end table next to him-

LARRY

Arthur

Uncle Arthur does not look up from his scribbling
Uncle Arthur

LARRY continues to stare at the ceiling

LARRY

Still without looking up
Uncle Arthur

Working on the Mentaculus
Long beat Music Scribbling

LARRY

Any luck um looking for an apartment
More scribbling

Uncle Arthur

No

The doorbell chimes

FRONT DOOR
LARRY enters glances through the front doors head-height

and-freezes one

hand arrested on the way to the doorknob

His point-of-view framed by the window yellowly lit by the
stoop light a human head

A middle-aged man a few years older than LARRY A fleshy

with droopy hangdog
warm

surroundings

features a five-oclock shadow and sad Harold Bloom eyes
LARRY opens the door

LARRY

Sy
Sy entering thrusts out a hand His voice vibrates with a

sad empathy

SY

Good to see you LARRY

He is a heavy-set man wearing a short-sleeved shirt that his
belly tents out in front of

him In his left hand he holds a bottle of wine

LARRY

(TIGHTLY)

SY

No actually LARRY Im here to see you if I might

He shakes his head
Such a thing Such a thing

LARRY
Shall we go in the
He is leading him into the kitchen but Sy oblivious to

plows on with the
conversation arresting both men in the narrow space between
kitchen sink and stove and

invading LARRYs space

SY
You know LARRY-how we handle ourselves in this
situation-its so impawtant

SKEWED ANGLE ON PARKING LOT
We are dutch on a slit of a view through a cracked-open

window the Hebrew
school parking lot
The last couple of busses filled with students are rolling

of the lot It is late
afternoon
A reverse shows DANNY in a stall standing on a closed

angling his head to peer out
the bathroom window opened at the top
The bathroom outside the stall Ronnie Nudell leans against

sink waiting sucking a
long draw from a joint
DANNY emerges from the stall Ronnie Nudell offers the

Ronnie Nudell
Want some of this fucker

HALLWAY

The bathroom door cracks open in the foreground DANNY peeks

top left drawer After a beat
the hanger turns

SANCTUARY
We are behind the two boys who sit side by side on the last

staring at the front of
the empty sanctuary Its stained glass windows further

the late-afternoon light

In deference to the location the boys wear yarmulkas

A long hold on their still backs

At length some movement in DANNYs back his head dips and
we hear him sucking on

the joint He holds it exhales and passes it wordlessly to
Ronnie Nudell

SUBURBAN STREET
We are pulling DANNY as he walks along the street eyes red-

still wearing his
yarmulka It is dusk
After a few beats of walking the front door of a house just
behind DANNY opens A
husky shaggy-haired youth emerges on the run
The sound has alerted DANNY Seeing Mike Fagle he too

begins

to run He reaches up

and grabs his yarmulka and clutches it in one of his pumping

fists

Pursued and pursuer both run wordlessly panting feet
pounding

Mike Fagle is closing But DANNY is already cutting across
the

Brandts front yard

approaching his own He plunges into the house and slams the

door

Mike Fagle draws up panting gazing hungrily at the house

Lights are on inside The house is a warm yellow citadel in
the

dusk

After a beat we hear faint and dulled the Jefferson
Airplane

Mike Fagle slinks away

PUFFY WHITE CLOUDS

A shockingly blue sky with picture-perfect clouds hanging in

it

After a beat the top of an aluminum extension ladder swings
in

from the bottom of the

frame and comes toward us

We cut to a side angle as the ladder clunk against a roof

It starts vibrating to the rhythmic clung of someone
climbing

Hands enter LARRYs head enters

He climbs onto the roof

He takes a couple steps away from the edge and stands
tentatively

making sure of his

balance He looks around

We are hearing a rhythmic
popping noise
LARRY reaches the peak and straddles it He looks down at

back yard

MITCH
Ow
Foreshortened Gar Brandt and Mitch are playing catch in

back yard With each toss

the ball pops alternately in fathers mitt and sons
Precariously balanced LARRY reaches out for the aerial He
y

touches it He

grasps it He twists the aerial

Something strange as it rotates the aerial creaks-a high

as pure as the hum
sounded from the rim of a wineglass

MITCH

Ow

Faintly under the wineglass sound and clouded by static a
high ringing tenor sings in

an unfamiliar modality Cantorial music

LARRY drops his hand Inertia keeps the aerial rotating

til it dies the sound drifting

away into the sybillant shushing of trees

LARRY reaches out again to turn the aerial The same crystal
hum cantorial singing

and now layering in the theme from F Troop

LARRYs look travels his point-of-view pans slowly off the

angle of father and son
playing catch travels across his own backyard and brings

the white fence that

encloses the patio of the neighbor on the other side

Gar (off)

Good toss Mitch

On the enclosed patio a woman reclines on a lawn chaise of

bands woven over an
aluminum frame She is on her back eyes closed against the

She is naked

Mitch (off)

Ow

LARRY reacts to the naked woman startled at first he moves
to hide behind the peak of the

roof But as he realizes that the sun keeps the womans eyes
closed he relaxes continu-

ing to stare

She is attractive Not young not old LARRYs age

After a still beat one of her hands gropes blindly to the

It finds an ashtray on the

table next to her and takes from it a pluming cigarette The
woman takes a puff and

replaces it

Mitch (off)

NOTEBOOK
A pencil scratches equations into a lamplit spiral notebook
Sidor Belarsky comes in at the cut So does the spluttering

suck-sound

of Uncle Arthurs
evacuator
Wider on Uncle Arthur in his pyjamas propped up on the

narrow

fold-out sofa writing

with one hand as he holds the evacuator hose to his neck
with

the other

Squeezed into the living room next to the fold-out sofa is a

camp cot of plaid-patterned

nylon stretched over an aluminum frame On the camp cot is
LARRY

lying half-in half-

out of a rumpled sleeping bag He stares at the ceiling a
damp

washcloth pressed against

his forehead His face is flaming red

Arthur speaks absently as he scribbles

ARTHUR

Will you read this Tell me what you think

LARRY continues to stare at the ceiling

LARRY

Okay

Uncle Arthur glances up from the notebook focuses on LARRY

ARTHUR

Boy You shouldve worn a hat

LATER

The lights are out Very quiet Uncle Arthur lightly snores

LARRY still stares at the ceiling He shifts his weight The

aluminum frame of the cot

squeaks He shifts again Another creak

LARRY fishes his watch from the jumble of clothes on the
floor

KITCHEN

LARRY in his underwear spoons ground coffee into the
percolator

Uncle Arthur snores
softly on in the other room

From outside a dull thunk

LARRY pulls back a curtain

Next door Gar Brandt is going down the walk wearing
camouflage

togs and camo billed

cap a rifle bag slung over his shoulder He is carrying an

ice

chest its contents clicking

and sloshing

The boy Mitch also wearing camo clothes and cap and also
with

a rifle bag has just

closed the front door He now lets the screen door swing
shut

behind him and follows his

father down the walk to the car in the driveway

The twitter of early morning birds Gars voice though not
projected

stands out in the

pre-dawn quiet

GAR
Lets see some hustle Mitch

CLOSE ON THE NOTEBOOK

Its top sheet densely covered by equations has a heading
The Mentaculus

Compiled by Arthur Gopnik

After a beat LARRYs hand enters to turn the page The

second

page is also densely

covered with equations

VOICE

LARRY

This brings LARRYs look up from the Mentaculus We are in
LARRYs

office Standing in
the office doorway is Arlen Finkle
LARRY

Hi Arlen

Arlen Finkle

LARRY I feel that as head of the tenure committee I should
tell you this though it should be no cause for concern You
should not be at all worried

LARRY waits for more Arlen seems to need a prompt

LARRY

Okay

Arlen Finkle

I feel I should mention it even though we wont give this
any weight at all in considering whether to grant you
tenure so I repeat no cause for concern

LARRY

Okay Arlen Give what any weight

Arlen Finkle

We have received some letters uh denigrating you and
well urging that we not grant you tenure

LARRY

From who

Arlen Finkle

Theyre anonymous And so of course we dismiss them
completely

LARRY

Well well what do they say

Arlen Finkle

They make allegations not even allegations assertions but

Im not really while we give them no credence LARRY
Im not supposed to deal in any specifics about the
committees deliberations

LARRY

But I think youre saying these wont play any part in
your deliberations

Arlen Finkle

None at all

LARRY
Um so what are they
Arlen Finkle
Moral turpitude You could say

LARRY
Uh-huh Can I ask are they are they-idiomatic
Arlen Finkle

I uh

LARRY

The reason I ask I have a Korean student South Korean
disgruntled South Korean and I meant to talk to you about
this actually he-

Arlen Finkle

No No the letters are competently-even eloquently
written A native English-speaker No question about

that

LARRY

Uh-huh

Arlen Finkle

But I reiterate this LARRY no cause for concern I only
speak because I would have felt odd concealing it

LARRY
Yes okay thank you Arlen

Arlen Finkle

Best to Judith

LARRY answers with a wan smile He looks down at the

Mentaculus

children

HEBREW SCHOOL EXTERIOR
Day Somewhere inside the school a bell rings Its doors

open and children

emerge

Our angle is down a line of school busses each with the the
same stenciled Hebrew

lettering waiting to ferry the children home

We are tracking toward the busses to steepen the rake As

sort themselves out
and climb into their respective vehicles the track brings
the

nearest bus into the fore-

ground It noisily idles with its signature squeaks and
stress

sounds its low coughing

engine ominously rumbling Children start climbing on

MINUTES LATER

Inside the bus now moving Engine noise bangs in louder and

air roars in through open

windows

We are on the driver a sallow man in a short-sleeved white
shirt

with earlocks anda

yarmulke He pitches about stoically wrestling with the
wheel

and gear shift as the

vehicle bucks

The pitching children Somewhere Jefferson Airplane plays

DANNY

I gotta get my radio back

Ronnie Nudell

Maybe the fucker lodged it up his fucking asshole

DANNY

I gotta get it back Or Mike Fagles gonna pound the crap
out of me

Ronnie Nudell

at something it seems
in distress We hear a fluttering sound
His point-of-view stakes are set out in the Brandts yard

ribbon connecting them
outlines a projection from the side of the house The loose

of the ribbon flutter in

the breeze

Engine noise brings LARRYs look around A car is arriving
It is the Brandts car oddly burdened As it pulls into

driveway we see that there is
a four-point stag strapped to the hood its head lolling

the grille
Gar and Mitch get out of the car in their hunting fatigues

shirt

GAR
Go scrub up Mitch

LARRY
Uh good afternoon
This brings Gars look around Apparently he is unused to

There is a short beat before his response

GAR

The child quickly goes LARRY frowns

LARRY

GAR
Took him out of school today So he could hunt with his

The thud of a car door outside

SARAH heads for the front door pulling on a jacket LARRY

surprised
Where are you going

SARAH
Im going to the hole

LARRY
At five oclock
He looks out the front-door window Four girls of SARAHs

are coming up the walk

from the car All have dark hair and big noses

SARAH

Were stopping at Laurie Kippersteins house so I can wash
my hair

LARRY pulls open the door just as the doorbell rings From

four dark girls

Hi Mr Gopnik

Out in a minute

JUDITH
Are you ready

LARRY
Huh

JUDITH

LARRY has his arms pinned at his sides by hugging Sy
Ableman

SY
LARRY How are you

LARRY
Sy

SY
Hello Judith

JUDITH
Hello Sy
Judith

Once Sy releases LARRY all seat themselves at Sys booth

next to Sy LARRY
facing

SY
Thank you for coming LARRY Its so impawtant that we be
able to discuss these things

LARRY
Im happy to come to Embers Sy but Im thinking really
maybe its best to leave these discussions to the lawyers

SY
Of coss Legal matters let the lawyers discuss Dont mix
apples and oranges

JUDITH
Ive beamed you to see the lawyer

LARRY
(teeth grit)
I told you Im going Monday

SY
Monday is timely This isnt-please-Embers isnt the
forum for legalities you are so right

JUDITH
Hmph

SY
No Judith and I thought merely we should discuss the
practicalities the living arrangements a situation that

conduce to the comfit of all the parties This is an issue
where no one is at odds
LARRY isnt sure where this is leading

LARRY
Living arrangements
SY
Absolutely I think we all agree the children not being
contaminated by the tension-the most impawtant

JUDITH
We shouldnt put the kids in the middle of this LARRY

LARRY
The kids arent-

JUDITH

Im saying

we Im not pointing fingers

SY
No one is playing the blame game LARRY

LARRY
I didnt say anyone was

JUDITH
Well lets not play He said She said either

LARRY
I wasnt I ---

SY
Aw right well lets just step back and defuse the
situation

LARRY
LARRY glares at Sy

Sy smiles at him sadly He reaches over and rests a hand on
LARRYs hand
I find sometimes if I count to ten
A beat
One two three faw Or silently
Long beat

JUDITH
Really to keep things on an even keel especially now
leading up to DANNYs bar mitzvah-
SY
A childs bar mitzvah LARRY

JUDITH
Sy and I think its best if you move out of the house

LARRY
Move out

SY
It makes eminent sense

JUDITH
Things cant continue as they-

LARRY
Move out Where would I go

SY
Well for instance the Jolly Roger is quite livable Not
expensive and the rooms are eminently livable

JUDITH
This would allow you to visit the kids

SY
Theres convenience in its fava Theres a pool-

LARRY

Wouldnt it make more sense for you to move in with Sy
Judith and Sy gape at him shocked

After a long beat

JUDITH
LARRY

SY
LARRY youre jesting

JUDITH
LARRY there is much to accomplish before that can happen
Sy is sadly shaking his head

SY

LARRY LARRY LARRY I think really the Jolly Roger is the
appropriate coss of action

He shrugs

It has a pool

IN BLACK AND WHITE A BRAIN

It sits in a large fishbowl filled with clear fluid

The brain alive pulses Leads connect it to various pieces
of gear outside the fishbowl

Brain and appurtenances sit on a dais of sorts dressed out

with

bunting

Oddly the picture is scored with cantorial singing

The brain seems to be giving orders to people who wear
imperfectly

form-fitting 1950s

uniforms of the future After receiving their instructions
the

minions of the brain
kowtow before it and leave They are succeeded by two

leather-helmeted

resisting

defiantly

thugs big and
heavy though lacking muscle definition who escort a

handsome man before the
brain The handsome man hands tied behind his back gazes

up at the brain

which in some fashion addresses him
We hear blows and voices over the cantorial music

DANNY
Stop it

SARAH
Creep fucker

DANNY
Stop it Im getting it Im gonna get it
Wider shows that the brain is on television which DANNY has

muted while he plays the

Cantor Youssele Rosenblatt record and drills his torah
portion

He and SARAH are ina

stand-off hands tensed to either deliver or ward off blows

SARAH
Brat
LARRY enters

LARRY

SARAH

Nothing
She closes the door behind her

LARRY
What was that

DANNY
Nothing

LARRY
Hows the haftorah coming Can you maybe use the hi-fi

DANNY

We hear the doorbell off LARRY indicates the portable
record

From off SARAH projects

ASIAN MAN

A middle-aged Korean man well groomed He wears a nicely
cut

suit and a jeweled tie-
pin

MAN

Culcha clash

He bangs his two knuckles together illustrating

Culcha clash

He faces LARRY in the driveway LARRYs car is half-loaded
with
open boxes that are

haphazardly stuffed with clothing and effects

LARRY is leaning against the hood arms folded gazing at
the
man unimpressed A long
beat

Finally he bestirs himself

LARRY

With all respect Mr Park I dont think its that
Mr Park

Yes

LARRY

No It would be a culture clash if it were the custom in
your land to bribe people for grades

Mr Park

Yes

LARRY

So-youre saying it is the custom

Mr Park

No This is defamation Grounds for lawsuit

LARRY

You-let me get this straight-youre threatening to sue
me for defaming your son

Mr Park

Yes

LARRY

Gar Brandt

Is this man bothering you

Gar Brandt stands on the strip of lawn separating the two

He is giving Mr
Park a hard stare

LARRY

Is he bothering me No Were fine Thank you Mr
Brandt

Gar Brandt not entirely convinced withdraws glaring at

Korean
LARRY turns back to Mr Park

I uh See if it were defamation there would have to
be someone I was defaming him to or I All right I

lets keep it simple I could pretend the money never
appeared Thats not defaming anyone

BL
Mr Park
Yes And passing grade

LARRY
Passing grade
Mr Par
Yes

LARRY
Or youll sue me
Mr Par
For taking money

LARRY
So he did leave the money
Mr Par

This is defamation
LARRY stares at him

LARRY

Look It doesnt make sense Either he left the money or
he didnt

Mr Park

Please Accept mystery

LARRY

You cant have it both ways If
Mr Park

Why not

LARRY stares

We hear Sidor Belarsky music

RECORD PLAYER

Sidor Belarskys singing crosses the cut The tone arm of
DANNYs

portable record

player rides on a spinning LP

Wider shows LARRY grading bluebooks at a small formica table

crowded into a corner of

his motel room It is a depressingly generic budget motel
room

of the mid-sixties with

cheaply paneled walls thin carpet formica night tables
plastic

lamps and twin beds

with stained nubby bedspreads

The phone rings

LARRY

Hello

He brightens

Fine Mimi how are you Uh-huh No its not

that bad Its not that bad Theres a pool

Arthur emerges from an alcove in the dim depth of the room

LAKE NOKOMIS

The beach families are crowded onto the small beach of a
freshwater

lake children

cavorting adults lounging much sun few umbrellas Red

floats

connected by red nylon

rope define a swimming area beyond it people dive from an
anchored

raft

Splashing and childrens laughter slap off the surface of
the

lake

WOODS

Above the lake The beach noise has some distance It also
has

a faintly bizarre canyon

echo There is a present sybillant shushing of breeze in
the

trees

It is dark here with intense hot spots where sun sifts
through

the leaf cover We are close

on DANNY who sits very still leaning back against a tree
trunk

After a very long beat he slowly exhales a small amount of
smoke

feathering out with his

breath

VOICE

Gimme that fucker
DANNY passes the joint to Ronnie Nudell who sits opposite

PICNIC AREA
On a woodless rise above the lake Each of the separate

picnic

areas consist of a redwood

table and benches placed next to a firepit

Here in the sun both LARRY and Mel Nudell a man slightly
older

than LARRY glisten with

sweat Mel in the background bounces a bag of charcoal
briquettes

to spill some into

the firepit LARRY sits at the table in the foreground with
Mimi

Nudell who alone seems

unaffected by the heat-or by anything else in the physical
environment

Her pale

gravely composed Giacometti face is shaded by a large-
brimmed

hat

LARRY

No Almost a year and a half since Touche Ross let him
go Hes very good with numbers I think his his social
skills have held him back

MIMI
Such a sweet man though

LARRY
Arthur has a good heart And he never complains unlike
me Sometimes I dont give him enough credit

MIMI
He tried to tell me about this thing hes working on this
um

LARRY

The Mentaculus He says its a uh a probability map

Of the universe He asked if I could help him publish it
Um it was a little hard for me to evaluate

A beat
MIMI
Does he go out socially at all

LARRY
He tries Hes been going to the singles mixers at Hillel
House-Well I should talk Im not doing any better

MIMI
How is Judith

LARRY
Fine Shes fine Im the odd man out
Mimi smiles

MIMI

Sometimes these things just arent meant to be And it can
take a while before you feel what was always there for
better or worse

LARRY

I never felt it It was a bolt from the blue What does that
mean Everything that I thought was one way turns out to

be another

MIMI
Then-its an opportunity to learn how things really are
LARRY broods Mimi softens

Im sorry-I dont mean to sound glib Its not always
easy deciphering what God is trying to tell you

LARRY
Ill say

MIMI

But its not something you have to figure out all by your-
self Were Jews we have that well of tradition to draw on
to help us understand When were puzzled we have all the

stories that have been handed down from people who had
the same problems

LARRY
I guess
MIMI

Have you talked to Rabbi Nachtner

Silence

Arthur is climbing the hill from the lake dripping wet He

projects

ARTHUR

Boy The air out here is magnificent

Mimi looking at LARRY responds to his dark silence

MIMI

Why not see him

Mel Nudell has finished spreading and lighting the coals He

now comes and sits next to

Mimi draping an arm over her shoulder She strokes his
hand

still looking at LARRY

LARRY

Whats the rabbi gonna tell me

MIMI

If I knew Id be the rabbi

He looks at her glumly She laughs

Life is beautiful LARRY Nobodys sick Nobody died
You just need help remembering how to enjoy it
She rests her head against Mels shoulder
Where are the kids

MEL

Woods Exploring

Uncle Arthur approaches swim trunks plastered to his
thighs

hair dripping one hand

pressing his towel to the back of his neck

SYNAGOGUE OFFICE ANTEROOM
Day LARRY sits waiting A door opens and he rises

LARRY
Oh-Rabbi Scott
Rabbi Scott Ginzler is the junior rabbi a man in his

Rabbi Scott
Hello LARRY

LARRY

I thought I was going to see Rabbi Nachtner

Rabbi Scott

He was called away on an etz monim Ruth Brynns mother

is in the hospital and she isnt doing well Rabbi Nachtner
asked me to cover for him-come on in

RABBI SCOTTS OFFICE
A few minutes later LARRY sits tensely hunched forward

Rabbi Scott

LARRY

And she wants a Gett

A long silence The hum of ventilation
At length

Rabbi Scott
A what

LARRY

She wants a-

Rabbi Scott

Oh a Gett Uh-huh sure

LARRY

I feel like the carpets been yanked out from under me I
dont know which end is up Im not even sure how to
react Im too confused

Rabbi Scott

What reasons did she give For the rupture
LARRY

She didnt give-reasons Just that oh you know things
havent been going well

Rabbi Scott

And is that true

LARRY

I guess I dont know Shes usually right about these
things

Rabbi Scott

Mm-hm

LARRY

I feel so addled
Rabbi Scott

Yes I can see

LARRY

I was hoping that Rabbi Nachtner
Rabbi Scott

That he would yes

LARRY
Well with the benefit of his life experience no

OFFENSE-

Rabbi Scott chuckles

Rabbi Scott

No of course not I am the junior rabbi And its true the
point-of-view of somebody whos older and perhaps had
similar problems might be more valid And you should see
the senior rabbi as well by all means Or even Minda if
you can get in hes quite busy But maybe-can I share
something with you Because I too have had the feeling of
losing track of Hashem which is the problem here I too
have forgotten how to see Him in the world And when

that happens you think well if I cant see Him He isnt
there any more Hes gone But thats not the case You
just need to remember how to see Him Am I right

He rises and goes to the window

I mean the parking lot here Not much to see
the

It is a different angle on the same parking lot we saw from

Hebrew school window

But if you imagine yourself a visitor somebody who

isnt familiar with these autos and such somebody
still with a capacity for wonder Someone with a fresh
perspective Thats what it is LARRY

LARRY

Um

Rabbi Scott

Because with the right perspective you can see Hashem

you know reaching into the world He is in the world not
just in shul It souunds to me like youre looking at the
world looking at your wife through tired eyes It sounds
like shes become a sort of thing a problem a
thing

LARRY
Well shes shes seeing Sy Ableman

Rabbi Scott
Oh

LARRY

Shes theyre planning thats why they want the Gett
Rabbi Scott

Oh Im sorry

LARRY

It was his idea

Rabbi Scott

Well they do need a Gett to remarry in the faith But this
is life For you too You cant cut yourself off from the
mystical or youll be-youll remain-completely lost

You have to see these things as expressions of Gods will
You dont have to like it of course

LARRY

The boss isnt always right but hes always the boss
Rabbi Scott

Ha-ha-ha Thats right things arent so bad Look at the
parking lot LARRY
Rabbi Scott gazes out marveling
Just look at that parking lot

EXTERIOR GOPNIK HOUSE
Our low angle looks across the lawn toward the front of the

house

Someones pounding

footsteps approach and his feet enter just off the lens and
he

quickly recedes cropping in

as he races up to the house DANNY

A beat later pursuing feet enter slowing-for DANNY is
already

mounting the front

stoop DANNYs pursuer does not go deep enough to crop in
but

we might gather from

the size eleven sneakers and the cuffed jeans that it is
hulking

Mike Fagle

GOPNIK KITCHEN

We hear the front door being flung open and slammed shut
and

in the background foyer

DANNY appears panting heavily He gives one glance back
toward

the front door and

then looks at his mother and sister eating soup in the
foreground

His sister has a towel

wrapped turbanlike around her head She holds it with one
hand

to keep it from tipping

off when she tilts her head down for the soup

DANNY
(still panting)
We eating already

SARAH
Im going to the hole
DANNY enters the kitchen and sits at the setting across from
his sister He picks up his

spoon

Some movement in SARAHs body DANNY recoils from a kick

DANNY

The siblings slurp soup neither answering
After a couple slurps
Isnt Dad eating

JUDITH

DON

under these circumstances

LARRY
Oh well

DON
I always thought you and JUDY were rock solid This is so
terrible LARRY This is devastating
LARRY

Well the way I look at it its an opportunity for me to
really sit down and figure things out and and look at the
world afresh instead of just you know settling for the
routine tired old way of looking at things

Don Milgram stares at him

DON
Really

LARRY

(DEFLATING)
I dont know Maybe not

DON

Well legally I have to warn you its never easy for the

DAWN AT THE JOLLY ROGER
Wide on the motel room dimly lit by weak sun starting to

seep

in around the curtain

LARRY sleeps in one of the twin beds Uncle Arthur snores in

the other

Uncle Arthurs breath snags and tangles on a snorfling
inhale

and it wakes him gagging

He blinks sits up swings his legs out gazes blearily
around

the room

He rises stiffly and heads for the bathroom

LARRY stirs The sound of Uncle Arthur urinating LARRY
looks

blearily around

LARRY stiffly rises He takes the two steps across the room
to

the formica desk on which

are spread papers for his class As we hear the sucking
sound

of the neck evacuator in

the bathroom LARRY sweeps papers together and mechanically
stuffs

his briefcase

CAR

LARRY is driving hollow-eyed to work

After a long beat of staring the ka-ching of a bicycle
bell

LARRYs eyes widen and his head swivels tracking as he
overtakes

and passes

The bicyclist A young Asian man wearing a white traffic-
mask

LARRY looks at him in the rear-view
LARRY
CLIVE

He starts frantically pumping down his window shouting
CLIVE You gonna send your mother next You little
bastard I wanna see you I wanna-

Crash

He has rear-ended someone

A blaring horn a quick second crash wrenching steel and
spattering

glass

He has been rear-ended in turn

The ka-ching of the bicycle CLIVE Park cycles past without
looking

BLEGEN HALL

LARRY enters the outer office hugging his paper-stuffed
briefcase

After a beat in black a white title
The Second Rabbi

The title fades

RABBIS OFFICE
We are close on LARRY He sits hunched forward hands

in front of him staring at
the floor sadly shaking his head
After a long beat

LARRY

It seems like shes asking an awful lot But then-I dont
know Somebody has to pay for Sys funeral

Rabbi Nachtner sitting opposite nods

Rabbi Nachtner

Uh-huh

LARRY

His own estate is in probate But why does it have to be
me Or is it wrong to complain JUDY says it is But Im
so strapped for cash right now-paying for the Jolly Roger
and I wrecked the car and DANNYs bar mitzvah I
Rabbi Nachtner
Something like this-theres never a good time

LARRY
I dont know where it all leaves me Sys death Obviously
its not going to go back like it was

Rabbi Nachtner

Mm Would you even want that LARRY

LARRY

No I-well yeah Sometimes Or-I dont know I guess

the honest answer is I dont know What was my life
before Not what I thought it was What does it all mean
What is Hashem trying to tell me making me pay for Sy
Ablemans funeral

Rabbi Nachtner

Mm
LARRY

And-did I tell you I had a car accident the same time Sy
had his The same instant for all I know Is Hashem
telling me that Sy Ableman is me or we are all one or
something

Rabbi Nachtner

How does God speak to us its a good question You

now Lee Sussman

LARRY

DOCTOR Sussman I think I-yeah

Rabbi Nachtner

Did he ever tell you about the goys teeth

LARRY

No I-What goy

Rabbi Nachtner

So Lee is at work one day you know he has the orthodontic
practice there at Texa-Tonka

LARRY

Uh-huh

Rabbi Nachtner

Right next to the Gold Eagle Cleaners
We cut to

SIGN FOR THE GOLD EAGLE CLEANERS

It dominates a small suburban strip mall

Rabbi Nachtner continues in voice-over as we cut to a smoked

glass door that identifies

Leon Sussman DDS

Rabbi Nachtner

Hes making a plaster mold-its for corrective bridge

work-in the mouth of one of his patients

A close shot of a mans mouth biting down on two horse-shoe
shaped

troughs-an upper

The patient opens his mouth as a hand enters to grab the

The reverse shows Dr Sussman a balding middle-aged man

in the the high-

collared white smock of an oral surgeon He carries the mold
over to a drying table

Kraus is twisted over the side of the chair spitting into

water-swirled spit-sink
Well the mold dries and Lee is examining it one day

before fabricating an appliance
Another day Dr Sussman is sitting at his desk examining

BACK TO RABBI NACHTNER

He confirms with a nod

Rabbi Nachtner

This in a goys mouth LARRY

BACK TO LEON SUSSMAN

The Rabbis narrative continues

Rabbi Nachtner

Sussman flips the loupe away and looks off haunted He

He checks the mold just to be sure Oh its there all

right
A dental mirror is dipped into the horse-shoe-shaped

paste of the mold It pans
tiny letters that stand out in relief right-side around in

mirror

Sussman leans back thinking

He calls the goy back on the pretense of needing additional
measurements for the appliance

Close on Kraus grinning as he shakes Sussmans hand in the

area Sussman

gestures to invite Kraus back to the examination room
Sussman chats affecting nonchalance

In the examination room leaning over Kraus in the chair

dentist is indeed chatting

with seeming casualness

Notice any other problems with your teeth Anything
peculiar et cetera

Sussman takes a dental mirror

No No No Visited any other dentist recently

He looks in Kraus mouth with the mirror

Ym nn
Sussman frowns
There it is Help me

He leans back
Sussman goes home Can Sussman eat No
Sussman sits at the kitchen table untouched food in front

him His wife chats volubly
while Sussman stares into space
Can Sussman sleep No

Sussman is in bed pyjamas buttoned to the neck staring at

ceiling

What does it mean Is it a message for him for Sussman
And if so from whom Does Sussman know Sussman

doesnt know

Back in the dental office Sussman pulls boxes containing

molds off the shelf

Sussman looks at the molds of his other patients goy and
Jew alike seeking other messages He finds none He

looks in his own mouth

Close on Sussman in front of a mirror straining to see the

reflection

snoring

dental mirror he holds in his own mouth
Nothing His wifes mouth
Sussmans wife lies asleep on her back her mouth open

softly Sussman in
pyjamas but with his glasses on and loupe in place lies

her in bed supporting
himself with one arm thrown across her body He leans

in carefully

lowering a dental mirror into his wifes open mouth
Nothing It is a singular event A mystery

The Jefferson Airplane guitar solo is heating up

But Sussman is an educated man Not the worlds greatest

sage maybe no Rabbi Minda but he knows a thing or two

from the Zohar and the Caballah He knows every Hebrew

letter has its numeric equivalent

Sussman still in his pyjamas is sitting at the kitchen

scribbling on a tablet of lined

paper

Close on the paper the Hebrew letters have been transcribed
into their numeric

EQUIVALENTS

Nachtner continues in voice-over

Seven digits-a phone number maybe
Sussman reaches for the phone He hesitates a moment then

dials
Sussman dials It rings
AN ELEVATED CUBICLE
n a grocery store A man in short sleeves reaches for the
phone
Rabbi Nachtner
ts a Red Owl grocery store in Bloomington Hello Do
you know a goy named Kraus Russel Kraus
The store manager is shaking his head
Where have I called The Red Owl In Bloomington
Thanks so much
The manager puzzled hangs up
Sussman thinks am I supposed to go to the Red Owl to
receive a further sign He goes
n the parking lot of the Red Owl Sussman wearing a short-
brimmed
fedora emerges
from his car It is an unremarkable grocery store ina
suburban
mall
Its a Red Owl
Inside Sussman in his fedora gazes around
Groceries What have you
A service alley behind the store dumpsters wind-blown
garbage
Sussman looking
On the wall behind the store a stain
There is an old rather nondescript stain of some liquid
splatted

against the back wall and
long since dribbled away
Could be a nun sofit Or maybe not
The parking lot again Sussman gets back in his car
bed

where

scene-nods

Sussman goes home What does it mean He has to find

out if hes ever to sleep again

Sussman again in pyjamas buttoned to the neck lies in his

staring at the ceiling

He goes to see the Rabbi Nachtner He comes in and sits
right where youre sitting now

Sussman is indeed sitting across from Rabbi Nachtner just

weve seen LARRY

sitting

What does it mean Rabbi Is it a sign from Hashem

Help me I Sussman should be doing something to help
this goy Doing what The teeth dont say I should know
without asking Or maybe Im supposed to help people
generally-lead a more righteous life Is the answer in
cabalah In torah Or is there even a question Tell me
Rabbi-what can such a sign mean

Nachtner-not the narrating Nachtner but the Nachtner in the

and
considers

LARRY
Staring at the Rabbi He waits a good beat
He prompts

LARRY

So what did you tell him

The Rabbi seems surprised by the question
Rabbi Nachtner

Sussman

LARRY

Yes

Rabbi Nachtner

Is it relevant

LARRY
Well-isnt that why youre telling me
Rabbi Nachtner
Mm Okay Nachtner says look
We are back in the scene narrated by voice-over of the

Rabbi

silently advising the

fretful Sussman

The teeth we dont know A sign from Hashem dont

know Helping others couldnt hurt

LARRYs voice-over question plays over Sussman asking the
same

thing

LARRY (of)

But is that what it meant-tet resh nun lamed nun shin

isayin was it Help me or a number Or was it

Rabbi Nachtner (off)

We cant know everything

Sussman stares blankly at the Rabbi

A beat

LARRY (of)

It sounds like you dont know Mthing

THE RABBI

Smiling equably at LARRY He reacts to the ejaculation with
a

shrug

LARRY scowls

LARRY

Why even tell me the story

Rabbi Nachtner

(AMUSED)

First I should tell you then I shouldnt

LARRY exasporated changes tack

LARRY

What happened to Sussman

SUSSMAN

In his office Working on different patients as the Rabbi
resumes

his voice-over
Rabbi Nachtner

What would happen Not much He went back to work

For a while he checked every patients teeth for new
messages didnt see any in time he found hed stopped
checking

Sussman at home chats with his wife over dinner

These questions that are bothering you LARRY-maybe
theyre like a toothache We feel them for a while then
they go away

Sussman lies in bed sleeping smiling an arm thrown across
his
wife

LARRY
Dissatisfied

LARRY

I dont want it to just go away I want an answer
Rabbi Nachtner

The answer Sure We all want the answer But Hashem
doesnt owe us the answer LARRY Hashem doesnt owe us
anything The obligation runs the other way

LARRY

Why does he make us feel the questions if hes not gonna
give us any answers

Rabbi Nachtner smiles at LARRY for a beat

Rabbi Nachtner

He hasnt told me

LARRY rubs his face frustrated
A last question occurs to him

LARRY

And what happened to the goy

Rabbi Nachtners forebearing smile fades into puzzlement
Rabbi Nachtner

The goy Who cares

EXTERIOR THE SYNAGOGUE
The modern synagogue grafted onto a patch of prairie
An echoing voice rings out
VOICE
Sy Ableman was a serious man

RABBI NACHTNER
In close-up he gazes around weighing the effect of the

words
just delivered
After a long beat during which he seeks to establish eye
contact
with as much of his
audience as possible
Rabbi Nachtner
Sy Ableman was a man devoted to his community
Wider shows Rabbi Nachtner up on the bema He and the
congregation
face each other
across a casket down at floor level
to torah study
LARRY sits among the congregants his gaze fixed on a point
off

to his beloved wife Esther until three years ago she
passed
LARRYs point-of-view JUDY is visible from 3 behind She
sits

a few rows ahead looking
grimly up at the rabbi

and to his duty as he saw it Where does such a man
go A tzadik-who knows maybe even a lamid vovnik-a
man beloved by all aman who despised the frivolous
Could such a serious man simply disappear
The words echo
Again the rabbi gazes around as if awaiting answer

THEN

We speak of Lolam ha-ba the World to Come Not
heaven Not what the gentiles think of as afterlife
Lolam ha-ba What is Lolam ha-ba Where is Lolam
ha-ba Well it is not a geoaraphic place certainly
Like-Canada
Murmured chuckles from the congregation
Nor is it the eretz zavat chalav oodvash-the land flowing
with milk and honey for we are not promised a personal
reward a gold star a first-class VIP lounge where we get
milk and cookies to eternity

More chuckles

Lolam ha-ba is in the bosom of Abraham Lolam ba-

ba is in the soul of this community which nurtured Sy
Ableman and to which Sy Ableman now returns Thats

right he returns Because he still inspires us Ableman
returns Because his memory instructs us Ableman

returns Because his thoughts illuminate our days and ways
Sy Ableman returns The frivolous man may vanish

without a ripple but Sy Ableman Sy Ableman was a

serious man

A sob echoes through the sanctuary
LARRY looks at Judith who stifles further sobs with a

handkerchief

weeping

opens

corner

her

balding

As you know the mourners kaddish does not mention
the dead It praises Hashem it praises what abides And
Sy Ableman whose spirit will continue to assist us in
tikkun olam is with us even now a serious man who would
say as we now say Yiskadal vyiskadash shmay rabah
The congregation begins to chant along but it and Judiths

are cut off by

A HAND RAPPING AT A DOOR
The front door to the Gopnik home
LARRY still in his suit from shul and wearing a yarmulka

the door He recoils in
surprise edged with fear
Reverse two uniformed policemen

CoP 1
Arthur Gopnik
LARRY is momentarily dumb Inside the house we can see a

of a card table set up in
the living room with food laid out on it SARAH sits with

back to us head wrapped by
a towel-turban Arthur on the far side of the table his
head domed by a yarmul-

ka half-leans out so that he may sneak looks toward the men
at the door without totally

revealing himself From somewhere down the hall come

Judiths

muffled sobs

LARRY

LARRY is wincing as he rubs a forearm under his shirtsleeve

LARRY
Just a sunburn Ive been spending a lot of time on the
roof For perspective

He trails off and his head drops back down onto his arms

gives him an appraising
look

DON
Have you seen the Rabbi

LARRY
(muffled again)
Talked to Nachtner

DON

LARRY
They told me Minda doesnt do pastoral work any more

LARRY gives a helpless shrug

Don rolls his eyes

What-did he tell you about the goys teeth

A knock on the door Don projects

Yeah

The door cracks open A pipe edges in followed by a peeking
face Solomon Schlutz

- Oh good Sol come on in

Solomon Schlutz is a large man in shirtsleeves and

He has the smooth
impassive face of a sphynx with a pipe clenched in its

He glides into the room a sheaf of files tucked under one

Sol has been looking into the property-line issues
Solomon Schlutz seats himself at the conference table and

sorting and arranging
the files into three piles
It seems that you do have a real problem with the
original survey But Sol seems to think theres some kind
of nifty way for us to-well I havent heard it myself Ill
let Sol map it out
Solomon Schlutz continues to arrange the files his eye

occasionally

justifies

that

lingering ona
specific page When at length he is finished he carefully

the edges of the closest
pile takes the pipe out of his mouth gives LARRY a smile
seems to take some effort

and then taps the pipe in a large glass ashtray

He looks up again at LARRY this time shocked His stunned
look

on LARRY holds for a

long beat

LARRY returns a bewildered look

Solomon Schlutz staring at LARRY as if he were some sort of
monster emits one barking

SYLLABLE
Solomon Schlutz
Gah
His stare holds He reddens

DON

-Sol

Solomon Schlutzs face now passes from the red end of the
spectrum

to the purple

Solomon Schlutz

Nnnnff

The pipe clatters out of his hand The hand grabs at his own

shirt front

Glufffl

Now his head pitches back His backflung weight and twisting

body send his chair

tipping over one hand still clutching at his chest while

the

other frantically waves He

disappears behind the conference table and lands with a
floor-shaking

thump His

writhing and gurgling remain audible

DON

Sol Sol

Don Milgram has risen to look down at his fallen colleague
now

he flings open the

conference room door and bellows into the office

An ambulance Quick Somebody call an ambulance A
DOCTOR

A secretary looks in and screams

wide shell-shocked The

secretary is at her typewriter but holding the phone one
hand

covering its mouthpiece

SECRETARY

LARRY

HIS OFFICE

LARRY sits in heavily behind his desk

A beat

He opens the top left desk drawer He withdraws the bulging
white

envelope and opens
its flap
He runs a finger over the wad of bills

VOICE

LARRY

He looks up startled

Arlen Finkle stands in the doorway

LARRY sits frozen with the white envelope in his hands

LARRY

onto

CLASSROOM
We are close over LARRYs shoulder as he scribbles symbols

the chalkboard
LARRY

and that means so that from which we derive
His glances back toward the class show that he is wearier

baggier-eyed

has

paneled

and

seated

more haggard
than ever There is also something odd about his posture
He writes smaller and smaller so as to finish before hitting
the right edge of the
chalkboard
and also which lets us and
Wider as he finishes and straightens up revealing that he

been stooping to write
across the very bottom of the board
The equation covers every inch of the classroom-wide three-

chalkboard LARRY
is an off balance figure at the right edge of frame
Reverse on the class staring
Okay
LARRY claps chalk dust from his hands
The Uncertainty Principle It proves we cant ever
really know whats going on
A bell sounds The students start to shake off their stupor

rise LARRY projects over
the wallah

So it shouldnt bother you Not being able to figure
anything out Although you will be responsible for this on
the mid-term

The thinning crowd gradually reveals one person still

Sy Ableman
He wears a prayer shawl and yarmulka

Ableman

and

LARRY does not

seem surprised to see him

Did you follow that

Sy Ableman

Of coss Except that I know whats going on How do you

He nods at the

LARRY

LARRYs brow furrows

LARRY

Sy Ableman holds up one hand to silence him

Sy Ableman

So simple LARRY See Minda

LARRY
I know I want

to see Minda I want to see Minda They

told me that oonh
Without our having seen him rise or cross the room Sy

has body-slammed

LARRY into the

chalkboard Now he grabs LARRY by the hair

whips his head against
the equation As he slams LARRYs head again and again the
pillow

sits

gives

chalkboard chatters and the

fringes on Sys tallis dance

Sy Ableman

See Minda See Minda I fucked your wife LARRY I
seriously fucked her Thats whats going on See Minda

LARRY
Very close on his eyes as they open His head is on a

Dull early light A hissing

sound

LARRY looks blearily over

On the vanity table just outside the motel bathroom door

Uncle Arthurs cyst
evacuator Its waggling hose snakes into the cracked

door as the machine
hisses

MEZUZA
On a doorpost
A hand enters to knock A long beat The person knocking

up and his footsteps
start to go away just as the door opens to reveal an

attractive

blouse

head

woman the sunbathing
neighbor now wearing plaid shorts and a buttoned white

Her point-of-view LARRY frozen halfway down the stoop

turned back up toward
the door

WOMAN
Mr Gopnik

LARRY

Oh Hello Mrs Samsky I knocked and then thought you
werent here I uh

Mrs Samskys voice is soft and breathy
LARRY

vertical

outside

for

Mrs Samsky
It just took me a second to get to the door I was out back
LARRY stands nodding
He seems to need prompting Mrs Samsky does
Can I help you Wanna come in

LARRY

No I-

One hand on the door she steps back
Mrs Samsky

Its cooler

LARRY
Oh Okay I just wanted to let you know
He is entering

INSIDE
After the outside glare the house does indeed seem cooler

looks around the living
room dim but neat Wavering light sifts through closed

blinds which drift and
click over floor-vented air-conditioning
Mrs Samsky closes the door shutting out all sound from

LARRY

Ive noticed that Mr Samsky isnt around and I-
Mrs Samsky

He travels

LARRY

Uh-huh Yeah I never seem to see him so I thought I

should let you know since youre somewhat new here if

you ever have whatever chores that youd um or just help
with something-Ive decided to help others-you know

in a neighborly way

She gazes at him with the least hint of a smile and waits

the speech to dribble away to
silence In the ensuing beat quiet except for the clicking

of

the blinds she is perfectly

still Finally only her mouth moves

Mrs Samsky

How thoughtful

LARRY shrugs off the compliment

LARRY

Oh its nothing Its just good to know your neighbors

And to help Help others Although I dont care much for

my neighbors on the other side I must say

Mrs Samsky lets another smiling silence pass before
responding

Mrs Samsky

Goys arent they

LARRY

Mm Very much so Maybe its not fair to judge I have to

admit I-

Mrs Samsky

Wont you sit down

LARRY

Oh Um Okay Thank you

Mrs Samsky

Iced tea I have some

She is already turning to the kitchen

LARRY

Okay

He watches her and reacts to

The backs of her thighs The flesh retains the broad cross-—
hatch

of her lawn chair

She disappears into the kitchen but calls out
Mrs Samsky

I dont see you around much either

LARRY
Yes Actually I havent been home a lot recently I uh my
wife and I are uh well shes got me staying at the Jolly
Roger the little motel there on-

Mrs Samsky is reentering with two tall glasses of iced tea
beaded

with moisture The

click of the ice cubes joins the clicking of the blinds

Mrs Samsky

Youre in the doghouse huh

She hands him a glass as she sits on the couch next to him
not

invasively close one bare

leg folded onto the couch the other draped over it

LARRY
Yeah thats an understatement I guess I -thank you-I

UH-

Mrs Samsky

Do you take advantage of the new freedoms

LARRY stares at her Mrs Samsky gazes back Her look
displays

equanimity his not

FINALLY

LARRY
What do you mean
Her look holds for one more beat and then she swivels and
opens
the drawer of an end
table

She turns back with a joint

Mrs Samsky

Its something I do For recreation
She lights it

LARRY

Thats Marijuana
Mrs Samsky

Mm-hmm

She hands the joint over
Youll find youll need the iced tea
LARRY handles the bitty cigarette with trepidation
from

as

door

LARRY
Is it well okay

THE VERTICAL BLINDS
Some minutes later They drift and click in the air blown

the floor vents
LARRY stares at them
After a long beat

LARRY

Maybe Rabbi Scott was right
Mrs Samsky

Whos Rabbi Scott

LARRY

The junior rabbi
Mrs Samsky

The junior rabbi

Another long beat Neither person feels compelled to speak

the blinds click
The joint makes another trip back and forth

THEN
What did he say

LARRY
He spoke of perception All my problems are just
just a a mere
He trails off listening
Is that a siren
Mrs Samsky

No Some people get a little paranoid when they Holy
cow That is a siren
OUTSIDE

The Samskys door opens and LARRY stumbles out He stares
The police car has stopped in front of his own house next

lights still flashing Two
the

house

open

and

cops are going up the walk with Uncle Arthur between them in
handcuffs
LARRY stunned walks woodenly toward his house

LARRY
Hey
Neither the cops nor Uncle Arthur has heard They have rung

doorbell and now
disappear inside
LARRY projects louder-

HEY
-and starts to sprint Mrs Samsky has emerged from her

behind
LARRY takes the stoop steps two at a time His door stands

and the theme from F

Troop issues from within
Just inside the two policeman stand with their backs to us

handcuffed Uncle Arthur
in between The three men face DANNY who addresses them

projecting

over the music
from the TV

DANNY
Sort of He sleeps on the couch

LARRY
This is crazy
This brings the cops look around Uncle Arthur also turns

shamefaced

to LARRY

COP

MRS SAMSKYS BEDROOM

LARRY is making strenuous love to Mrs Samsky

Mrs Samsky

So good so good

She rolls on top of LARRY to straddle him and still
humping

she lights a mentholated

cigarette LARRY moans

LARRY

Oh my God Mrs Samsky

Beyond her head LARRY can see the low cottage-cheese ceiling

of the bedroom Outside

we can hear Gar Brandt mowing the lawn

Suddenly we hear muffled laughter and the front door
opening

LARRY panics He hisses

Who is it

Footsteps are approaching along the hall Mrs Samsky
doesnt

react she looks calmly

down at LARRY even as the bedroom door opens behind her and
CLIVE

Park walks in
wearing a traffic mask LARRY is mortified
CLIVE please Wait outside
Mrs Samsky blows smoke into LARRYs eyes The screen goes

black

Close on LARRY as he opens his eyes A shadow falls across
his

face

His point-of-view a wooden plank is just being slid into
place

over his head The bang

of hammer on nailhead In the black

Sy Ablemans Voice

Nailing it down is so impawtant

We hear the chanting of Kaddish and the sound of dirt
hitting

the top of the coffin It

drums a steady rhythm Grace Slicks voice enters Somebody

to Love In a break in

the vocals right before the chorus

Mrs Samskys Voice

Its something we do For recreation

On the chorus downbeat a crescent moon pops into the black

Gar Brandt traverses the

sky pushing his lawn mower A cow flies the opposite way
Stars

twinkle Sy Able-

man walks across the sky dressed like a shtetl elder a
bindlestick

over one shoulder

LARRY bolts upright in bed

Sudden quiet

Uncle Arthur is snoring in the tatty motel rooms other bed
A title burns in

He lapses into silence staring at the secretary

She stares inscrutably back

After a moment she rises goes to the door behind her opens
it shuffles into the dimness

of an inner office

LARRY cranes to see past her Her own body and the dimness

with a good view
of the figure hunched behind the desk The man is old and

His desktop is empty
Murmured voices in Hebrew

A clock ticks in the outer office LARRY looks around

Mysterious Judaica adorns the outer office
The old woman is shuffling back She closes the door on the

rabbi and sits
down heavily behind her own desk

SECRETARY
The rabbi is busy

LARRY
He didnt look busy
As she starts shuffling papers

SECRETARY
Hes thinking

NIGHT
Sidor Belarsky comes in at the cut

We are booming down on LARRY asleep in bed

We hear weeping soft suppressed

LARRY stirs He opens his eyes

After a groggy beat he reacts to the weeping He looks over

LARRY
Arthur Arthur
Arthur is a dim mound on the next bed His weeping
continues
For no reason LARRY continues to keep his voice to a
whisper
Arthur Whats wrong
No answer
Arthur Itll be okay Arthur Well get Ron
Meshbesher Itll be okay-

ARTHUR

AAAHHHH

Shockingy loud the scream is hard to interpret

Arthur flings off his bedclothes He leaps from the bed and
runs

to the door In boxer

shorts and undershirt he flings the door open and runs out
of

the room

LARRY
Arthur
LARRY leaps from his bed also in his underwear
He goes to the door but pauses peering cautiously outside

Satisfied

that the courtyard is

deserted he plunges into it

COURTYARD

The courtyardparking lot is hardlit by ghastly mercury
vapor

lights The pool

surrounded by chain-link fence has been drained Its white
concrete

interior is cracked

and weedy

Uncle Arthur is hunched weeping in a corner of the pool
enclosure

LARRY

(HISSING)

Arthur

He opens the creaking gate and scurries over to Arthur

Youve got to pull yourself together

Arthur is suddenly angry His voice bounces off the

concrete

ARTHUR

ARTHUR

He starts weeping again

LARRY looks around

LARRY

Arthur This isnt the right forum Please Not by the
pool

Arthur weeps

Arthur Its okay Its okay

MORNING

LARRY and Arthur are driving We are looking at the two of
them

square through a

windshield in which towering conifers stream by in
reflection

It seems to be a glorious

day

LARRY
Is this it
Both men peer out
different

canoe

pocket

ARTHUR
I think so yeah there
He indicates the road ahead

A SIGNPOST

The old-fashioned kind with wooden fingers pointing the

directions
One points toward CANADA

We tip off the sign as LARRYs car passes
is a canoe strapped to its

roof

BOUNDARY WATERS

Beautiful wooded remote

The car is parked at waters edge having
of two tracks worn

through the undergrowth LARRY and Arthur

into water

LARRY

Okay

He straightens Arthur straightens LARRY
-Look

and recedes There

backed down a lane

are lowering the

hugs him

They separate and LARRY pulls a white envelope from his

and gives it to Arthur
Thisll help you get back on your feet
Arthur looks into the envelope

ARTHUR
Oh my God Where did you get this

LARRY
Doesnt matter When you-

ARTHUR
This is a lot of money

LARRY
It should get you started

ARTHUR
This is a lot of money Are you sure you dont need it

LARRY
Arthur Im fine Come on get in When youre settled

Arthur climbs into the canoe
let me know how to get in touch
He helps push the boat off Arthur is twisted around

looking

back As he drifts off

ARTHUR

Are you sure this is okay

LARRY

Its fine Its fine

LARRY waves

Arthur waves bravely back then turns to pick up the oars A

couple of strokes and he

turns back again with a last thought He calls

ARTHUR

LARRY Im sorry What I said last night

LARRY

I know Its okay

A lingering look from Arthur and then he turns back to row

A gunshot

Blood spurts from the back of Uncle Arthurs neck

He slumps forward dead

VOICE

Good shot

LARRY looks wildly around He sees

Gar Brandt and Mitch in their camo fatigues hard to pick
out

in the foliage They are

looking off toward the canoe Mitch just lowering his rifle
Gar Brandts look swings around into the lens He points at
us
Theres another Jew son

Mitch swings his rifle toward us
He fires

LARRY

Gasping awake in the motel room

He looks around

It is dawn

Arthur sits on the edge of his bed in his underwear staring
off into space slackjawed

vacant-eyed drained

LARRY gazes around the room waiting for things to fall into
place

Finally blearily

LARRY
Were we out at the pool last night
Arthur still staring off responds in a flat empty voice

ARTHUR

Yes Im sorry

LARRY blinks sleep away
After a beat

LARRY

Its shabbas

Another beat

Arthur heaves a deep sigh

ARTHUR

RESTROOM
Day A two-urinal two-stall mens room of old tile and

fixtures
We are low One of the stall doors is closed Under it we

the dress shoes and dress

pants of two young men standing inside
We hear a long sucking inhale

Ronnie Nudells Voice

Gimme that fucker

A loudly projected echoing male voice

VOICE
Yaamod habrayshit

SANCTUARY
DANNY seated in the second pew next to his parents and

and Uncle Arthur rises
and shuffles along the row to the aisle His eyes are wide

red-rimmed
The prelapped voice was his call to the torah All eyes in

congregation which fills
the large sanctuary are on him
In great echoing silence he walks to the steps on the right

of the bema and climbs
The right-side lectern is surrounded by a gaggle of old

men They busy
themselves with the preparation of the pair of scrolls on

lectern rolling them
pausing rolling some more muttering prayers kissing the

by means of their
tsitsim They pay DANNY no attention
DANNY takes his place centered behind the lectern His chin

up to the bottom of
the reading platform
Men continue to mutter prayers around him A pair of hands

on his shoulders
from behind DANNY looks down at the strange hands They

him back
A foot drags a small riser out from under the lectern
Hands push DANNY up onto the riser

Booming up on the torah scrolls still being busily rolled
Beyond it a sea of faces

The yad-a molded tin pointer-is thrust into DANNYs hand

The

non-pointing end has

a red silken tassel

DANNY looks at the bouncing tassel He looks at the little
pointing

finger which is the

business end of the yad

Men mutter around him each a different prayer They dip and

doven

DANNY watches himself point the yad down at the scroll

The scroll is a dense swarm of Hebrew letters DANNY
squints

One voice separates from the murmurs around him It chants
insistently

in a sotto-voce

FALSETTO

VOICE

Nefesh echad sheichayim yitzeh gamor shel effashot

DANNY is still staring at the end of the yad against the
parchment

scroll

Someones hand enters and moves the yad to a different place

in the text

The voice repeats

Nefesh echad sheichayim yitzeh gamor shel effashot

DANNY looks up from the scrolls

In the congregation Ronnie Nudell sits hunched-shouldered
and

squished between his

parents He returns DANNYs red-rimmed slack-jawed stare

The insistent voice

Nefesh echad shelchayim yitzeh gamor shel effashot

DANNY looks over

From the surrounding scrum the prompter nods at him He
looks

somewhat like Cantor

Youssele Rosenblatt

Nefesh echad shelchayim yitzeh gamor shel effashot
DANNY looks back down at the scroll A hand enters to tap a
pointing
finger where the
yad points
Nefesh echad shelchayim yitzeh gamor shel effa-
DANNY suddenly erupts

DANNY
Nefesh echad shelchayim yitzeh gamor shel effashot

PROMPTER

Mm-hm

DANNY continues to boom out the torah portion He moves the
yad

along the line of
letters
n the congregation LARRY and Judith watch We hear DANNY
chanting
fluently and
LARRY squeezes the hand Judith has laced through his arm
Juith whispers

JUDITH
m sorry that things have been so hard for us

LARRY
ts okay

JUDITH
Sy had so much respect for you LARRY
He pats her hand
A beat
He wrote letters to the tenure committee

LATER
The congregation is loudly singing VZos Hatorah A tallised
man of late middle age
turning

the

steeply

who

hoists the open scroll from the lectern and raises it high

his back on the
congregation so that all may see it
DANNY has been ensconced in a highbacked chair upstage on

bema
His point-of-view of the man holding the torah is close and

raked The man is

sweating The heavy scrolls vibrate slightly from his effort
to keep them aloft As the

congregation continues to sing he mutters under his breath

MAN
Jesus Christ

LATER
DANNY stands behind the left lectern facing Rabbi Nachtner

holds a small kiddush
cup out to him
Although Rabbi Nachtner seems to be addressing DANNY he is

projecting

loudly

NACHTNER

taking your place as a member of our tribe You will
go and see Rabbi Minda after the service You will cele-
brate in a reception downstairs in Schanfield Hall And
then you will be a member of BNai Abraham and of the
Nation of Israel DANNY Gopnik the Sisterhood makes a
gift to you of this kiddush cup so that you will remember
this blessed day on the next shabbas and the next and on
every shabbas of a long and fruitful life and until that
wonderful day when you stand under the chupa we say

CONGREGATION

Amen

DANNY still red-eyed tries to focus

His point-of-view shows the kiddush cup large in the

foreground

extended toward him

by the Rabbi beaming above

His own hand rises into frame to grasp the kiddush cup
The congregation starts Adon Olam

desktop

on

sound

A DOOR

Creaking open The cut has snapped off the robust Adon Olam
leaving sepulchral quiet

DANNY clutching his kiddush cup hesitantly enters the dim

Mindas elderly
eastern European gatekeeper closes the door behind him
Minda is an old man staring at him from behind a bare

His look eyes
magnified by thick glasses is impossible to read
DANNY creeps to the chair facing the desk He gingerly sits

the squeaking leather
upholstery self-conscious under Mindas stare
Minda breathes regularly through his mouth It is the only

in the room

A long beat The two sit face to face

Minda smacks his lips a couple of times preparing to speak
Another beat

FINALLY

MINDA

When the truth is found To be lies
He pauses He clears his throat

At length

And all the hope Within you dies
Another beat DANNY waits Minda stares
He smacks his lips again

Then what

DANNY doesnt answer It is unclear whether the question was
directed at him
Quiet

Minda clears his throat with a loud and thorough hawking
The hawking abates Minda sniffs

Grace Slick Marty Balin Paul Kanta Jorma
somethin These are the membas of the Airplane
He nods a couple of times
Interesting
He reaches up and slowly opens his desk drawer He takes
something
out He lays it on
the bare desk and pushes it partway across
Here
It is DANNYs radio
Be a good boy

clenched tight on the wheel Wipers pump to keep up with the
rain The cars behind

Passing streetlights rhythmically sweep LARRYs face their

stippled and bent by the
rain on the windows

TALMUD TORAH PARKING LOT

We hear very compressed the beginning of Somebody to

DANNY sees a shaggy-haired youth among the milling students
DANNY

Hey Fagle

From behind DANNY over his shoulder we see a funnel cloud
the middle distance

A growing rumble The tornado is approaching

At the first downbeat of its chorus the Jefferson Airplane
bumps up full

We cut to black and credits
