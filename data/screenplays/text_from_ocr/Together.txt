TOM
And were you in the public advocacy
arena before this

JOANNE
Not at all

TOM
What did you do before

JOANNE
House wife And before that
banking Before I had kids

TOM
Well quite a change from banking
And from kids Why the transition

There’s something open and simple about his statement that
causes Joanne to hesitate Then she opens up

Joanne is

JOANNE
The truth I was bored My
husband is aa hedge fund king
He’s a wildly wealthy individual
And I was at home with our kids
with our big life just
feelingdrowned And I knew that
I had a higher calling that I had
something more that I could offer
the world and I wanted to The
question was what could I do here
where my kids are in school where
my husband works And this
spoke to me Advocacy for women is
something I I know what it is
It made me feelconnected And I
just knew that I could do it And
my husband Richard gave me the
money He is our funder

TOM
Do you ever think about opening
this up to other funding sources

JOANNE

Yeah Yeah I don’t like being
dependent on just one source It
sounds strange to talk about my
husband that way I mean it’s
amazing what he’s done really
butI think to legitimize this
we need to show we can compete in
the world That’s why you’re here

TOM
Do you ever find that it’s a
hindrance to be rich Like people
don’t take you seriously or they
think you’re out of touch or

a bit taken aback

TOM (CONTD)
Sorry I’m pretty frank It’s
something I’m still trying to lose
it doesn’t really fit in with the
corporate world

JOANNE
No that’s okay You’re here to
gather information right

TOM
I like to approach my work
organicallyhonestly if I can
As much as I can so

JOANNE
You said you don’t really fit into
the corporate world Did you do
something else before

Yeah I was an artist a
contemporary artist That was a

few years ago But I’m stillI
don’t know once it’s in you you
sort of see the world that way

JOANNE

Have you been to Allegretti

INT ALLEGRETTI RESTAURANT - DAY
Lunch is past but Tom and Joanne are still talking

TOM

I was in Chad I was twenty four
I still the remember the smell
there - the earth the dust When
you stepped off the plane it would
permeate you everywhere and your
heart would quicken because you
knew that you were going to be
saving lives and changing lives
including your own You didn’t
knowwhat was going to happen on
the other side of the day You
felt like you were doing something
important Even when you were
smoking drinking reading you
know fucking off in your tent you
felt that you were saving energy
for something vital But
--when I came back everyone was
already in survival mode laying
track for their future projecting
five years ten years how they
werepositioning And I was
this artistweirdo I don’t know
I met my wife started the company
and now there’s kids andhey
let’s just say that none of our
lives are up for radical change

JOANNE
That’s not true

TOM
Come on We might extrapolate a
little bit you know bust outdo
a little coke once a year Try
surfing or something

JOANNE
I don’t agree with you I never
stop believing that things can be
revolutionary

TOM
(laughs)
Come on are you serious

JOANNE
What

TOM
No offense but the only reason you
can say that is because you can
financially afford to You can hit
the reset button any time you want
start over go back to school

JOANNE
That’s not what I’m talking
about

TOM
Of course it is At our age every
human being every working human
being has a bottom line

JOANNE

There is a bottom line My husband
islocked into his thing My
kids are in their schools they
have their lives they have their
friends and

(pause a smile)
You seem very interested in my
money

TOM
No I’m interested in the
empowermentif it exists You’re
telling me it doesn’t exist Are
you gonna burst my bubble

JOANNE

You ever heard of the Relative
Happiness study A group of
psychologists measured the
happiness quotient of paraplegics
and Lottery winners at the point
of impact when they first found
out about their “condition” In
terms of happiness they were
here

(her hands far apart)
Six months later they were
here

(hands closer)
And six months later

(her hands come together)
No difference

a normal life together we might
just fall asleep It happens

Is that what happened to you and
your husband

JOANNE
Richard I was never as alive with
Richard as I am with you But I
love Richard I had my children
with Richard and a home with
Richard I think marriage in some
ways is for sleeping If you
don’t you exhaust yourself

No Marriage is for both It has
to be for both

JOANNE
Do you have both with Sarah

I changed I didn’t have to she
didn’t make me but I made bad
choices I thought I had to hem
myself inand she wanted a
different kind of life than I was
giving her It’s not her fault
Maybe I could get it back but it
feels too far away now

I’m not helping

It’s not you You’re helping me
You’re making me understand it all

It can’t go on this way It’s too
much tension

what goes on in here I’ve passed
by it so many times and never

(beat)
(MORE )

RICHARD (CONTD)
I guess I should put it all back in
the box now that I’m seeing
someone I know from the school
right

TOM
You should do what you want

RICHARD
It’s funny school Everyone has
to pretend that they don’t have a
penis or a vagina that they
don’tI don’t knowdo hard
drugs Get drunk That they’re
never desperate That nothing bad
ever happens

TOM
I know what you mean

RICHARD
But I guess it’s a matter of
principle right It’s a matter of
stability Do I want unstable
people around my children No Do
you

TOM
No

RICHARD

You know maybe this can be like
one of the old movies where men
get drunk together And they have
camaraderie just because they’re
men

(to bartender)
Get him another

TOM
No

RICHARD
Come on drink with me I’m buying
One drink with me before you go

Richard comes to sit near him

RICHARD (CONT’D)
All my friends we have a schedule
We have to schedule a social visit
three weeks in advance It’s never
like that in the movies right
TOM
It depends on how you live

RICHARD
I probably don’t make a lot of
sense tonight I’m just a little
upset
(to bartender)
Give me another one

TOM
Why are you upset

RICHARD

II lost a lot of money this
week Probably more money than you
could get your head around Oh
I’m not broke Far from it
ButI may not have a company

ordered Very ordered I’m not
used to this

A beat

TOM

RICHARD
I like making money I see the
world that way and I’m great at it
I can’t help it A while ago I
went to India with my wife I went
for a deal On a private plane

guide We made a few air-
conditioned stops I didn’t care

talks about it Someday when I

want

But I’m finally starting to
understand it now

RICHARD

So why don’t you be it then
TOM

I’m trying
RICHARD

Do you know the secret of human
nature You probably do or else
you wouldn’t be sitting in this bar
right now but I’m going to tell
you anyway

(MORE)

RICHARD (CONTD)
It is the reason I’ve been able to
make all this money It’s
something that very few people can
admit to themselves because the
truth of it drives most people mad
(beat he leans in)
There’s a whole world below our
world Below all this we’re all
just one action one word one
touch away from chaos And every
day it’s up to each of us whether
to give in to it or to fight In
every single second you’re
aliveyou make the choice
(beat)
Like tonight I’ve never set foot
in this place and suddenly I feel
I could do anything

TOM
Youre a little drunk

RICHARD
I’m having a bout of emotional
honesty With an almost complete
stranger Maybe I should try a
therapist

TOM
That would be safer

RICHARD
Come on - let’s pretend we’re in
the movies we’re two reporters and
were both after the same girl we
go on a drinking bout and talk all
night man to man like nobody does
