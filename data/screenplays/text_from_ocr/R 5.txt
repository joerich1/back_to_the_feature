OMAR
He looked behind him Saw that he
was being followed by his
footprints and his shadow He
decided to outrun them But no
matter how fast he ran the
footprints and shadow stayed right
there behind him Finally he ran
so hard he collapsed and died of
exhaustion The thing is

He moves a Rook over from the corner

OMAR
If the man had stopped there would
have been no more footprints
(MORE )

OMAR (contd)
And if he had rested in the shade

of a tree then his shadow would
have disappeared

HAWLEY
Who told you that story

Hawley pushes another pawn forward Threatening Omars
Queen

OMAR
My uncle Back in Somalia

He hands the massive rifle to Morphy

SALESMAN

perfect for easier transportation

MORPHY

moved your Queen to Rook 5

HAWLEY
Queen to R5 Damn it

OMAR
Oh well Too bad for you My
turn now

Hawley and Omar switch seats Hawley watches as Omar and

Mahfouz set up their pieces

OMAR
The Dutch Counter Gambit is only
efficient if you are prepared to
move your Queen out

HAWLEY
Too dangerous

OMAR
Dangerous yes But its a careful
balance my friend You must keep
your Queen seated on the back line
until your opponent makes his
attack But then you must move her
out Use her strength to dominate
the board

MAHFOUZ
Youre patience is what makes you
so lethal my friend But you must
also know when to take action To
utilize the element of surprise

Mahfouz opens by moving his Queens pawn out two squares

Omar immediately responds with the Queens Gambit
