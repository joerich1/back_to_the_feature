sound Then immediately --

Silence

FADE IN
INT INTERROGATION ROOM
Small Enclosed Halogen bulbs hum in the ceiling
EMERSON LITTLE sits alone at a table He has two-day
stubble A rumpled suit and tie His face is beat to
hella cut lip and a gash in his forehead
He remains still Calm and collected
Above the fluorescent lights FLICKER --
EXT CITY STREET - NIGHT
-- OFF AND ON as a street lamp struggles to stay alive
Single snowflakes flutter pastits the end of a big

storm

A Mercedes is parked at the curb Otherwise the block is
empty

INT MERCEDES - NIGHT

Emerson clicks off the radio Finishes a cigarette Drops
it out the window Hes clean shaven His suit is pressed
His face has not yet been soured by cuts and bruises

GRAY (50s) listens to messages on his cell He takes off
his glasses and rubs at the bridge of his noseafter a
moment he closes the phone

GRAY
A lesson for the young one
EMERSON
Whats that

GRAY
Never allow your Chilean wife to
find out about your Bolivian
girlfriend

EMERSON
Common knowledge old man

Emerson looks over a HAND-WRITTEN NOTE From top to bottom
its covered in numbers

EMERSON
Authenticate

He hands the note to Gray who blinks at it for half a
second before giving it back

GRAY
Authenticated

A car passes in the opposite direction They instinctively
watch it in the rear-view mirrors as it drives away
following its movements without a breath until it turns a
corner at the end of the block

GRAY
Ten minutes

EMERSON
Start the count

Emerson gets out of the car Steps on a graveyard of
cigarettes buried in the snow

EXT DOWNTOWN - CITY STREETS - NIGHT

The air is still The night is calm

Emerson walks alone His feet crunch through the snow He
holds the hand-written note like a map Lets it guide him
through the streets

GRAY (VO)
Never thought Id see the day

INT INTERROGATION ROOM

Gray enters Closes the door Circles Emerson
GRAY
--You of all people turning
something so simple into such a
goddamn Canadian cluster fuck

Grays anger is readily apparent On his face In his
walk Within his fist that twitches open and shut every few
seconds

EMERSON
It didnt have to go that way

GRAY
Well of course not But when it
does I expect you to keep a cool
head Show a little

professionalism
EMERSON
It was --
GRAY

-- Instead you what You fly off
the handle How am I supposed to
respond How do you want me to
treat you

EMERSON

Gray SLUGS Emerson right in the jaw Knocks him clean out
of his chair Gray regrets it immediately Helps Emerson
off the floor Back into his seat

EMERSON
--Get it out of your system

GRAY
Like you didnt just piss on our
careers On my career

EMERSON
How much longer with all this

GRAY
Its gonna be awhile The boys
upstairs are --

EMERSON
Could I get a coffee

Emerson squirms in his seat Reaches up to scratch the cut
in his forehead His hands are cuffed together with an
industrial cable tie
GRAY
Yeah Sure Cream Sugar Do I
look like a fucking barista

Gray leaves On his way out he SLAMS THE DOOR AS --

INT BAR - NIGHT

-- EMERSON ENTERS He looks around The place is dark
Booths draped in shadows A few lights here and there Two
BOUNCERS play pool at a nearby table The BARTENDER watches

a soccer match on the big screen No one else in sight

BARTENDER
Sorry pal Were closed

Emerson stuffs the hand-written note in his pocket Stumbles
towards the baris he drunkor just acting The
Bouncers look up from their game

EMERSON
Justajusta

He falls onto a stool at the bar Rights himself Sits up

EMERSON
Just a water

BARTENDER
Youyou lost buddy

EMERSON
I just need some water

The bartender hesitates a second He seemsoddly
relieved Walks to the sink Pours a cup of water from the
tap Waves the bouncers back to their game

Emerson turns his head ever so slightly Watches the
bouncers Studies their immediate surroundings Focuses on
the nearby rack of POOL CUES --

INSERT

Lightning fast Emerson precise and without any excessive
motion cracks a POOL CUE over one bouncers head then
stabs him in the chest with the splintered wood

BACK TO SCENE

-- The bartender comes back with the glass of water

BARTENDER
Ten dollars
EMERSON
For water

BARTENDER

Emerson reaches into his coat Takes out his wallet as the
Bartender folds a DISHRAG --

INSERT

Faster than we can really tell whats going on Emerson
vaults over the counter Strangles the bartender with the
DISHRAG

BACK TO SCENE

-- Emerson pays the man The bartender turns back to the
soccer game Emerson sips from the glass

EMERSON
May I ask Wheres the rest of the
money

Whatever slur or stutter or mumble of words that dripped
from Emersons mouth a few seconds ago is gone Replaced
with an emotionless tenor Serious Focused Foreboding

BARTENDER
What

EMERSON
We got to the accounts in Zurich
In the Caymans Sowheres the
rest

The bartender turns around On his face realization
understanding and horror

BARTENDER
Youreyoure uhsitting in it

The bartender looks to the bouncers for help Realizing
theyre oblivious to the situation he takes a few steps
back Tries to get far away from Emerson Nowhere to go

BARTENDER
At least tell me who sent you

EMERSON
Does it matter

The bartender reaches out for a nearby SHELF --

INSERT
Slow The bartender grabs a bottle from the shelfswings
it at Emersonwho ducks the blow and thenwith the
momentum of his entire bodyuppercuts the bartender square
in the jaw

BACK TO SCENE
-- The bartender holds onto the shelf to keep from fainting

One bouncer glances up from the pool table Sees the look
of absolute terror on the bartenders face Nudges his
buddy They approach the bar step up on either side of
Emerson

UGLY BOUNCER
Alright time to go

EMERSON
(feigning drunk)
But I just got here

Emerson reaches out for his glass of water

BARTENDER
Wait We should really show our
friend here the back room

UGLIER BOUNCER
The back

BARTENDER
Where we keep the other stuff

Emersons fingers tense around the GLASS as the bouncers
grab him and lift him from the stool As they do his
jacket opens The ugly one spots a 45 tucked in his belt

UGLY BOUNCER
He has a --

Doesnt get to finish Emerson smashes the GLASS against
the bouncers temple Spins in his stool Attacks Slams
the guys head onto the bar Pulls him up Snaps his neck

-- The bartender DIVES for something behind the counter --
Emerson punches the second bouncer in the larynx Knees him
in the groin Headbutts him Pulls out a combat knife and
slashes his throat from ear to ear

The bartender pops up Double-barreled shotgun ready to go
Emerson jumps to cover behind a booth as buckshot punches

holes through the vinyl backing Draws his gun Returns
fire The bartender ducks to reload
Comes back up to fire But Emerson is faster Puts two
bullets in the bartenders chest A third in his head

Emerson stands Holsters his gun Retrieves his combat
knife and slides it up his sleeve He looks around
Surveys the scene --

DR MUNROE (VO)
How long have you been here

INT INTERROGATION ROOM
Emerson blows steam off the top of a cup of coffee

EMERSON
Forty Forty-five hours

DR MUNROE is seated across from him She flips
through a thick file a composite sketch of a BALD MAN -- a
crime scene photo of a DEAD WOMAN in the snow -- a DOSSIER
with Emersons photo at the top -- memos with an official
LETTERHEADand so on

DR MUNROE
You eat

EMERSON
Im not hungry

DR MUNROE
That wasnt my question

She stops at a page of interest Her eyes dart from side to
side as she reads

DR MUNROE
Tell me about the bar

Emerson leans forward in his chair
INT BAR - NIGHT

He surveys the scene Silence for a few seconds Hes on
his way out the door when --

-- The sound of a DOOR LATCH from somewhere in the back of
the bar Emerson stops dead in his tracks Not sure he
heard what he heard Then another sound BANGING

EMERSON
Shit

He bolts for the back of the bar Into a cramped hallway
that leads to the bathroom He tries to open the door
Locked Tries to force it open with his shoulder No good
INT BAR - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Emerson KICKS in the door No ones here Snow blows into
the room from an open window Emerson stands on the toilet
Looks out the window --

-- Sees a BALD MAN running through the snow Down the
street Away from the bar He turns a corner Disappears --

Emerson steps off the toilet Looks around Anger
Frustration He PUNCHES the wall Bad idea Thick cement

INT BAR - NIGHT

Emerson paces the bar Back and forth Looks around What
is he missing Cant quite put his finger on it

INSERT --

From a few moments ago but slower than it actually happened
the bald man walks out of the bathroom as Emerson slashes
the bouncers throat Horrified at the scene the bald man
turns and scrambles back the way he came as the bartender
starts shooting

BACK TO SCENE

Emerson stops Rubs his bleeding knuckles Looks around
the bar --

INSERT --

Slow the bald man runs through the snow Down the street
Away from the bar SMALL DETAIL he isnt wearing a coat

BACK TO SCENE

Emerson finds a dark booth On it a half-drunk beer
Chips and salsa Financial reportspaper workthe
detritus of an accountant pulling an all-nighter

On one of the seats a JACKET He grabs it Rummages
through the pockets Finds a wallet Inside the bald
mans DRIVERS LICENSE He stares at it Lights a
cigarette Takes a long drag

EMERSON (VO)
You dont happen to smoke do you

INT INTERROGATION ROOM
Dr Munroe looks up from the file Takes a pack of

cigarettes from her pocket Throws it on the table with a
lighter
Emerson puts a cigarette in his mouth Negotiates around
his cuffed hands to light it Through all this she watches
him

DR MUNROE
I didnt know you smoked

EMERSON
I didnt know you cared

DR MUNROE
When did you start

EMERSON
Right after I quit drinking

DR MUNROE
Why did you stop drinking

EMERSON

EMERSON
How much longer with all of this

DR MUNROE

Emerson takes a drag from the cigarette He STUBS IT OUT ON --
EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT
-- THE SIDEWALK Stands up straight Looks at the bald
mans driver license Ahead of him at the end of a snowy
walkway a three-story suburban house
Emerson looks up and down the block Oak trees canopy the
street Snow blankets the ground Plastic Santas pose on

front lawns with Dasher and Dancer and all the rest

Behind Emerson still in the car Gray leans out the window

GRAY

EMERSON
Start the count

Emerson walks towards the house Halfway there he takes
out his gun At the door he stops Thinks for a second
Takes a breath KICKS in the door

INT SUBURBAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The bald man runs up the stairs Emerson puts a round
through his leg Watches him fall forward The bald man
tries to crawl the rest of the way Emerson walks past two
packed suitcases ready for a long trip

He ascends the stairs with speed and agility Steps on the
bald mans leg Keeps him from going anywhere The bald
man rolls over to face his attacker

BALD MAN
I guess this was expected

Emerson FIRES twice Job doneturns to goonly to find
a young woman at the bottom of the stairs The bald mans
DAUGHTER She looks more shocked than anything

DAUGHTER

DAUGHTER

Gray jumps from the car Pulls out his gun Runs towards
the girl and Emerson

GRAY
Get off of him right now

EMERSON
--Dont do anything

Emerson holds up his hands Tries to wave off Gray The
girl pounds on Emersons unprotected face Shes stronger
than she looks judging from the damage

DAUGHTER

GRAY
»-This is your last

EMERSON
-I have this

DAUGHTER
-- WHAT DID YOU DO --

BOOM Louder than cannon fire Gray shoots her Center

Emerson stands Cant believe what just happened Looks
down at the girl Shes still alive but just barely

EMERSON
What did you

GRAY

SMASHES Emerson in the forehead --

BLACK

Soft In the background Almost like its not even there
Static Building and building

CUT TO
INT GRAYS OFFICE - DAY

On Emerson The gash in his forehead has been stitched
shut He sits and waits In front of him someone opens a
shade Lights pours onto his face Fills the room

Bare white walls No artwork or framed diplomas A black
desk A plastic ficus in the corner A magnificent view of
a skyscrapered city through floor-to-ceiling windows

Gray stares out at the view Emerson at the back of the
room sits in a leather chair

GRAY
They said I had to be the one to
talk to you --

EMERSON
-- I cant --

GRAY
-- I hate it Just hate it That
it has to turn out this way --

EMERSON
-- I cant --

GRAY
-- I took care of the girl I took
care of the police

EMERSON
I cant do this anymore
GRAY
This iswhat

EMERSON
The job I cant do it anymore

Gray opens a wet bar under his desk Pours himself a
scotch Across the room Emerson watches the alcohol fill
the glass Listens to the ice melt

GRAY
What would you do

No answer

GRAY
You cant do it anymore What would
you do thenif not this job

EMERSON
Something else

GRAY
There isnt anything else This is
what you do This is who you are
One bad night and youre ready to
hang up your hat Drink

Emerson shakes his head at the offer He tries to focus
Cant Looks exhausted

GRAY
Sides think they let you up and
quit Think they let you just walk
With what you know

EMERSON

GRAY
-- Listen Im your friend here
But in all honesty Truth be told
No one cares what you think

EMERSON
Yeah I --

GRAY
-- What you need What theyre
willing to offer here isa change

Emerson taps his fingers on the chair Gray crosses the
room Stops short

Circles back to his desk for the bottle

GRAY
We have a station for you to look
after Broadcast station Easy
work

Gray finishes his drink Stands over Emerson as he slowly
refills the glass Emersons eyes swim in the liquid gold
as it bubbles and froths from the bottle

EMERSON

GRAY
The desert Far the fuck out in the
desert Nevada Utah I dont
know myself

EMERSON
How long

GRAY
Until you can get your head right
I told them it was temporary
insanity

EMERSON
It wont change the way I--

GRAY
-- You want I should make a call
Tell them you want out Tell them
you want to retire

Emerson taps his foot His whole body shakes He tries to
hide it Tries to ignore Grays drink Hard to do on both
counts at this distance

EMERSON
The deserts fine

GRAY
Fine This isnt holiday huh
This isnt vacation This is
punishment

Gray leaves the bottle on the arm of the leather chair
Walks back to his desk

GRAY
This is reprimand This is dont
fuck up so badly next time

EMERSON
Right

GRAY
And Ill tell you what You know
how lucky you are to be getting a

Gray takes a manilla envelope from his desk throws it
across the room Emerson catches it flips through the
contents memos a map a plane ticket --

GRAY
Alternating shifts Three days ata

Emerson closes the folder Stands Gray stares out the
window It really is a beautiful morning

GRAY
No thank you

Not a chance

GRAY
Do the job huh Id rather not
look like an ass for sticking my
neck out on this one Cause now I
have nothing left No political
capital Nothing that can keep you
from the wolves And like I said
if you dont have the job

Emerson opens the door Outside two BRUISERS in business
suits wait for him He steps into the hall SHUTS the door --

INT OBSERVATION ROOM

Emerson asleep with his head on a table POPS awake Hes
sweating Gasping for air He looks run down Broken

The table is covered with papersmemosthat same
letterhead we keep seeing But look closer in the corners
in the marginsdoodlesendlessly repeating doodles of
spirals and snowflakes

The room is dim its hard to see though the number of
lamps in here that arent turned on make it more of a choice
than a design flaw Theres a bookshelf against the wall

A computer in the corner A rotary telephone next to it A
cabinet A table in the center of the room

Over Emersons shoulder a two-way mirror looks into the
BROADCAST ROOM next door On the other side KATHERINE
reads into a microphone off a sheet of paper

Emerson stands Rubs at his temples Collects the papers
Tosses them in the trash Knocks on the mirror to get
Katherines attention Exits

INT MAIN HALL

Sterile Claustrophobic Doors line both sides Security
cameras are mounted in every cornerflashing green lights
beside every lens

Emerson walks to the first door -- the GALLEY Enough food
stores to last through a nuclear holocaust Flips the light
off continues down the hall --

-- Next the INFIRMARY Glass medicine cabinets and an
operating table --

-- The BARRACKS Two cots A bathroom at the other end --

-- The ARMORY An electronic keypad next to the handle
reads LOCKED Emerson tests the doorknobso it is

-- The next door has no label Its dark inside --

INT SORTING ROOM

Emerson turns on the light as he steps inside Old run-
down machinery fills the room He walks up and down the
maze of metal presses and conveyor belts Checks every
corner every hidden nook On his way out he turns the
light off Closes the door to --

INT BASEMENT

-- DARKNESS

A door at the top of the stairs opens and floods soft light
into the room Emerson stands silhouetted within the frame

He reaches inside and clicks the light switch A bulb in
the ceiling flickers on and then immediately burns out

EMERSON
Shit

INT OBSERVATION ROOM

Emerson jots down a note REPLACE BASEMENT LIGHT He tapes
the note on the wall next to the door

INT BROADCAST ROOM

Katherine pulls a sheet of paper from the rapid-fire
printer That recognizable letter-head is at the top of the
pagethe rest of it is covered only in numbers

A program is open on her computer Looks like proprietary
software Dozens of windows filled with formulas and odd
data Technical information Things well never quite
understand

She sits at the computera master of the software Pulls a
single window to the front Within it she adjusts what
looks to be a RADIO FREQUENCY She stops when it matches
the first five numbers on the printing

She clicks ACCEPT through multiple windows A light on the
nearby microphone turns green She leans over and without
any emotion reads the numbers from the printing into the
microphone

KATHERINE
Nine Two Nine Four

INT MAIN HALL

Emerson waits Slouches against the wall Tries to get
comfortable Checks his watch Looks across the hall to
the Broadcast Room door it is thick shiny metal with no
obvious hinges or latches

A light above the door flashes RED

INT BROADCAST ROOM

Katherine turns off the microphone Turns off the computer
At the door she enters a long code in an electronic lock

INT MAIN HALL

The light above the Broadcast Room turns solid GREEN
Emerson slides a security card through a reader on the wall
From inside the door a number of locks disengage The door
slides open with a THUD

KATHERINE
Sorry A broadcast came through as
I was packing up

EMERSON
(joking)
This is going in my report

KATHERINE
Shut up

She playfully hits him in the arm as they walk down the
hall

INT LOBBY

Emerson leads Katherine through a generic waiting room
Coffee table Couch Mirror But like the rest of this
place no windows

INT ENTRY STAIR

A security camera watches from the corner as Emerson and
Katherine ascend the long dark stairwell

INT ANTECHAMBER

A square room smaller than the rest Monitors computers
and electronic panels line the walls The only other exit
is a thick steel door

Emerson presses a button and the steel door unlatches ina
long drawn-out process As it slides open bright
stinging sunlight breaks into the room

EXT POSTAL BUILDING - DAY

Long abandoned An old Western Union stop on the train out
west A cracking concrete building in the middle of the
desert retrofitted with 20th century electronics flood
lights a high-tech security door satellite dishes etc

Emerson and Katherine exit the building and walk to the
parking lot -- a ten foot patch of worn concrete
Emersons battered Taurus is parked in the sun nearby

They are completely alone Civilization belongs nowhere near
this place
The door to the station slides closed behind them

automatically

KATHERINE
Where are they

EMERSON
Theyll be here

KATHERINE
Do we have to wait

EMERSON
No but were going to anyway

KATHERINE
My train is at seven

EMERSON
Somewhere you have to be

KATHERINE
We have plans for tonight

Through an open window Emerson takes a pack of cigarettes

from the glove box in his car Offers one to Katherine

KATHERINE

Trying to cut back He hates that I

smoke

EMERSON
Oh the things we do for love

Katherine walks around to the trunk of the car

tosses her the keys

KATHERINE

He bought me the patch last week
Said I was being a bitch Well the

word he chose was irritable
know what that means

Katherine takes a set of clothes from the trunk

Emerson

Emerson

turns away as she changes on the other side of the car

EMERSON
Here they are

A pickup truck speeds across the desert towards the station

It screeches to a stop on the pavement

EMERSON
Hey Meredith

Emerson waves
MEREDITH steps down from the passenger side

MEREDITH
Been waiting long

EMERSON
Nah Youre fine

KATHERINE
Speak for yourself

MEREDITH
(Whispering)
Whats her problem

Emerson shrugs Who can know with this girl

DAVID - suit and tie slicked hair - gets out of the
truck He shields his eyes from the sun as he walks towards
Emerson

DAVID
Good shift

EMERSON
Got to catch up on my sitting alone
and not doing anything for seventy
hours so that was nice

Meredith checks her watch

MEREDITH
Were late

DAVID
Gotta go

EMERSON
See you

Katherine steps out from behind the car changed now into a
flight attendants uniform

KATHERINE
(re the outfit)
Eight months of this youd think
itd be less embarrassing by now

EMERSON
Now imagine if you actually were a
stewardess

KATHERINE

I shudder to think

As Emerson walks up to his car he glances in the SIDE
MIRRORand sees David put his arm around Merediths
waistbut when he turns to look back
Whatever it was he saw is over now David enters a code into
an electronic lock then scans his eyes in a nearby retinal
scanner The door to the station slides opens

KATHERINE
Hey Come on

Katherine gets in the car Emerson stares at the station
Watches the door close behind David and Meredith Katherine
honks the horn to get his attention

EXT DESERT - DAY

Emerson and Katherine drive through the desert a wake of
dust and tumbleweeds behind them

No sign of life in any direction

INT TAURUS - DAY

The car nears a twenty-foot-high electrified fence
stretched across the desert A makeshift road leads towards
a small automatic gate at the bottom of the fence

A REMOTE stuck to Emersons dash lights up and the gate
opens As Emerson drives through it shuts itself again
just as quickly

On the fence a sign PRIVATE PROPERTY - NO TRESPASSING
EXT DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

Emerson turns onto the two-lane highway

INT TAURUS - DAY

Speeding down the highway Something in the dash rattles
Katherine fiddles with the AC vent Emerson looks annoyed
Keeps quiet about it

EXT TRAIN STATION - DAY

Dirty Run down Stillthe middle of nowhere

A ticket seller sleeps behind the counter A passenger
train is stopped on the platform An ATTENDANT walks
between cars waiting to depart The Taurus pulls into the

nearby dirt lot --

INSIDE
-- Emerson puts the car in park He watches the attendant
carefully Studies him Focuses on his every move Lost
in his thoughtslost in his planning

KATHERINE

down on his necktie until it strangles him Emerson kicks
out the mans leg Punches him in the windpipedead

BACK TO SCENE

KATHERINE
Thats not normal

EMERSON
Its survival

KATHERINE
When most people see a necktie they
think of a matching shirt

EMERSON
Think of it this wayI1ll hardly
be surprised the next time someone
tries to kill me

KATHERINE
And when was the last time someone
actually tried to kill you

EMERSON
Its been awhile

KATHERINE
I think now more than ever you
need to let mens fashion be mens

Katherine gets out Grabs her bags from the trunk
to Emersons window

KATHERINE
And when are we on again

EMERSON

EMERSON

KATHERINE
(joking)
Company man

He watches her as she walks to the platformclimbs onto
the train He lights a CIGARETTE --

INT TAURUS - DAY

-- Takes a drag from it Stops the car on the side of the
road Unbuckles his seat belt Turns the AC on full blast
Paranoid he never stops looking in the mirrorschecking
his blind spots

A car drives down the highway Slows as it approaches the
parked Taurus

Emerson reaches for the gun he keeps stashed in the car
door He clicks off the safety Pulls back the hammer
Keeps his eyes on the car --

EXT DESERT - MILE MARKER 525 - CONTINUOUS
-- A Mercedes It stops on the other side of the highway
The drivers window rolls down A MAN IN A FEDORA leans out

the window Signals for Emerson to do the same He does

FEDORA
You lost buddy

EMERSON
If Im lost then so are you pal

FEDORA
Where are we brother

EMERSON
Couldnt tell you friend

They both get out of their cars Stare blankly back and
forth across the highway

In the distance a BIG RIG appears over the horizon
Emerson eyes it nervously tries to watch the man in the
fedora at the same time

EMERSON
Youre not my usual

FEDORA
Hes on vacation

The man in the fedora turns back into his car Leans over
the seat --

INSERT

Slow the man in the fedora spins around a gun in his hand
Emerson sprints across the highwayslams the car door shut
on the guydisarms himbreaks his handthrows him in
front of the big rig as it passes

BACK TO SCENE

-- But the man only turns back around with a white envelope
in his hand The big rig speeds past just close enough to
give the man a bit of a scare Emerson cracks a smile

The man crosses the highway holding his hat down to keep
the wind from blowing it away He hands Emerson the
envelope

FEDORA
People talk about you Around the
office you know Youre younger
than I thought you would be

EMERSON
Are you coming on to me Or just
really bad at this whole covert
thing

The man tips his hat at Emerson a flare of sarcasm

FEDORA
Give my regards to the fuck-all and
the heat would you

The man gets back in his car flips a u-turn and tears off
down the highway

EXT DESERT TOWN - DAY

The kind of town that was long-abandoned for the urban
niceties of growing metropolises The buildings are old and
rundown Most of the shops and stores are boarded up
Emerson drives through the only intersection in town He
passes a broken-down car raised up on blocks

EXT MOTEL - DAY

The Taurus pulls into the parking lot The kind of motel
where the rats outnumber the occupants

INT EMERSONS MOTEL ROOM - DAY

Sad Lonely Filthy

Emerson enters His home away from the station As he
closes the door the room is flushed in a murky brown
darkness He sits on the bed and chain-lights his next

cigarette

He takes the white envelope from his pocket Flips through
the contents CASH Large and small bills

INT DINER - NIGHT

A relic Even the air is greasy

The single WAITRESS behind the counter reads a magazine
Emerson the only customer in the place finishes a cup of

sheet

EXT DESERT TOWN - GAS STATION - MORNING

Emersons movements are mechanical His arms stiff His
eyes glassy

EXT TRAIN STATION - DAY

A passenger train pulls up to the platform The doors open

relief

Katherine gets in the car Throws her bags into the back
seat She looks like shes trying to hide somethingcant

KATHERINE
When I didnt get off the train

She tries to emulate Emersons look of concern Cant do it
quite right Makes herself laugh even harder

Emerson smiles but tries not to let her see it as he pulls
the car out of the lot and onto the highway

INT TAURUS - DAY

Katherine fiddles with the radio Cant find anything but
static and white noise

Emerson looks over and notices a ring on her finger

EMERSON
Whats with the ring

KATHERINE
Nothing

She pulls the ring off Sticks it in her pocket He looks
concerned She tries to avoid him by staring out the
window

EMERSON
It looks like an engagement ring
KATHERINE
A master of observation
EMERSON
He asked you to marry him
KATHERINE
Maybe
EMERSON
And you said yes
KATHERINE

brush he thinks he sees something Keeps an eye on it for
a second Nothing there Just his imagination

EMERSON

hangs from live wires in the ceiling

The doors to the Barracks and the Infirmary are broken off

BACK TO SCENE

-- Emerson tries to find a weapon Something he can use to
defend himself Nothing comes to mind He gives up Dives
under a cot just before the masked man enters

UNDER THE COT

Emerson focuses on controlling his breathing No sudden
movements Nothing to give himself away

He watches the masked man approach the bathroom

job Katherine No matter how much the man pulls and
struggles he cant get the door open

INT BATHROOM

She doesnt realize it but the bottom of the shower is
caked with blood

INT BARRACKS

The masked man fires five bullets into the bathroom door --

away from the cots Takes a step towards the bathroom

Emerson reaches out grabs the masked man by the ankles and
pulls The man falls forward on his face Loses his grip

on the gunthey both watch on the weapon slide across the
floor

Emerson climbs out from under the cot He grabs the man and
pulls off the mask Anyone he recognizes

Nojust a guy named FISCHER A real brute of a
manhas some seven inches and fifty pounds on Emerson

Fischer punches Emerson in the face Gives him the
opportunity to get back on his feet

They attack one another A flurry of perfectly executed
martial arts This is no competition Every blow made is
performed with one purposeto kill the other man

Fischer nails Emerson in the side with a fast one-two
Emerson SHRIEKS in pain Stumbles back Fischer presses
forward Tries to keep landing blows Opens himself up --

-- Emerson grabs Fischer Lands a vicious combo that snaps
the guys arm in twothen knees him in the chestand
ends by putting his head through the wall

crawl the rest of the way Emerson takes aim with the gun
Fischer stops crawling His face is covered in sweat --

From somewhere distant the sound of staticsoftbarely
there

-- Emersons finger starts to squeeze the trigger He
stops Frozen Lost in thought Fischer backs away
Makes it to the top of the stairs Runs as best he can

INT ANTECHAMBER
Fischer hobbles through the antechamber Hes almost to the

door Emerson tackles him from behind Punches him They
wrestle for the gun

The gun goes off Fires a spread of bullets into the
ceiling Fischer wraps his fingers around the trigger
Forces the muzzles up under Emersons chin Emerson pushes
back
BOOM

Fischer takes the bullet right in the eye Sprays his brain
all over the wall Emerson falls back Gasping hard for
air He leans over Fischers body Searches the pockets
Comes up with nothing

He sees the bit RUBBLE stuck in the door jamb He kicks it
out of the way The steel door slides shut with a THUD

The electronic locks all turn from red to green

INT BARRACKS

Emerson knocks on the door to the bathroom No answer

EMERSON

The room is exactly as Emerson left it three days ago
Whatever happened in the rest of the stationdidnt make

Emerson enters Looks around On the other side of the two-
way mirror the Broadcast Room looks undisturbed as well

He stands over her Watches She opens a MEDIA PLAYER on
the computer (again custom software) and a toolbar appears
at the bottombut the rest of the window is empty

Within the program Katherine switches between multiple
CHANNELS labeled Main HallBasementInfirmaryetc
Through every channel the window never changes

EMERSON
Like I said

KATHERINE
I wonder

Katherine opens another program on the computer Looks a
lot like the first one

EMERSON

The AUDIO PROGRAM is laid out much like the media player
Katherine presses PLAY Nothing but silence She flips
between the channels Stops on the Barracks channel PLAY

program Chipmunk voices run backward at triple speed He
presses PLAY

On Emerson as he listens to the tape --
INT BARRACKS - 100 PM

(This is Emersons subjective interpretation of events
based entirely on what he hears from the tapes What we see
is likely to change The audio here is taken directly from
the recording Crackles and popsodd filtered sounds in
the backgroundetc Often the audio shouldnt match what
we see)

-- David paces Hes frantic A bloody nose Torn
clothing He looks like hes been through the ringer --

DAVID

creaks Faintly the hiss of static The monotone of white
noise

At the end of the hall the florescent bulb swings back and
forth Light flickers through the hall

KATHERINE
The basement

EMERSON
Maybe

KATHERINE

What if someone is still here

EMERSON
They could have killed us a dozen
times over

Thats unsettling

You think someone who breaks in
here To this place You think

What if theyre waiting for us

Emerson holds the scalpel as if to prepare for a knife
fight He inches down the hall Katherine notices the gun
tucked into his pant waist

KATHERINE
What about the gun

keep her hands from shaking She uses the light to guide
Emerson down the stairs

He steps down onto the landing Straddles over the BODY as
Katherine watches from above

KATHERINE
Did he just move

wanted to continue) and looks up at Katherine

EMERSON
No

KATHERINE
You ever get used to it

EMERSON
Not reallydrinking helps

Katherine lightly steps onto the landing Stays as far from
the body as she can Aims the flashlight back towards the
tabletowards the second dead body

Emerson descends the stairs and walks to the body on the
table Its immediately obvious who ever it happens to be
has been shot a number of times in the back

Emerson pulls the body off the table Its DAVID He had
been covering a LAPTOP Katherine sees his face and gasps
DROPS the flashlight It falls through the slats Lands
Spins Stops on Emerson projecting his enormous shadow
onto the far wall

EMERSON
Its OK Ill

Emerson grabs Davids body Pulls it to the corner of the
room Lays it on the floor Something isnt quite right
Notices Davids right hand has been cut off at the
wristand bandaged haphazardly to stop the bleeding

EMERSON
Yeah

Katherine retrieves the flashlight

KATHERINE
What

EMERSON
It was Davids hand

She backs against the wall Shakes her head uncontrollably

EMERSON
Hey You still with me

KATHERINE
Im nauseas

EMERSON

Deep breaths

Emerson walks back to the landing Checks the sight line
down to the table Crouches down Holds his hand up like a
gun Adjusts the angle until it is just right

INT BASEMENT - PRESENT

Emerson flips open the laptop The warm glow from the
screen cuts away at the darkness A prompt on the screen
reads COPY COMPLETE

Emerson follows a length of CORD out of the back of the
computer to a SERVER CLUSTER under the stairs He thinks
for a second then YANKS the cord from the servers

EMERSON
What do you know about computers

KATHERINE
A good amount

EMERSON
Think you could find out who owns
this laptop

KATHERINE
I think so

EMERSON
Can you try

KATHERINE
Could take awhile

EMERSON
Try Do it

Katherine pulls up a chair Shes about to sit when she
realizes its covered in blood She pushes it away Kneels
in front of the laptop Goes to work

Emerson sifts through Davids pockets Finds a gun in his
waist band Checks the clip

EMERSON
Hey Look at that Six more
bullets

KATHERINE

Were rich

He holds the gun out to her but she shakes her head

KATHERINE
I dont even know how to load that
thing

EMERSON

Already loaded Good to go

KATHERINE
Still No thanks

She turns back to her work

He stares at the gun in his hands Runs his fingers down
the barrel --

Emerson takes a seat at the COMPUTER TERMINAL next to the

servers

Lights a cigarette

EMERSON
Im not sure if Ican you hum a
few bars

Both chuckle Then theyre back to the silence She types
away at the laptop He drags on the cigarette

EMERSON
This is it This is what I do I
started right out school Just like
you Started in data analysis
Failed at that They put me on the
field Failed there too Failed at
most everything They were going to
burn me out Then I found my niche
I was good at it Great even I
helped retire operatives

Through this Emerson boots up the computer Loads the
AUDIO PROGRAM

INSERT

KATHERINE
What do you mean retire

EMERSON
When an asset isnt relevant to the
agency anymore When their services
areif theyI would kill them
Id hunt them down --

Fast Emerson shoots the bartender Twice in the chest
once in the head

BACK TO SCENE

EMERSON
-- And kill them

This hangs in the air between them She turns to look at
him but he wont face her He fiddles with the audio

program

KATHERINE
Why did you stop

Hes ready to stop talking about it Doesnt want to be an

ass about the whole thing

EMERSON
(joking)
Oh you knowthe usual stuffit
wasnt challenging me
Professionally

He presses PLAY The crackle of recorded silence fizzles

from the speakers

KATHERINE
Again with this

EMERSON
Id like to hear the whole thing

KATHERINE
Whats the point

EMERSON

KATHERINE
What was his last name

EMERSON
I dont have many friends

Emerson flips between channels in the audio program Lands

on the Barracks and immediately --

KATHERINE
Theres something here on the
laptop but its encrypted

EMERSON
They copied something from the
server right

KATHERINE
Looks like a good guess at this
point What thoughI am in no
position to say

EMERSON
If you had the money and the means

to steal from the agency what would

be on your list

KATHERINE
Thats a long list

EMERSON
My point

KATHERINE

So then why leave the laptop

Youve got what you came for and you

leave it in the basement

Scared

She
EMERSON
Maybe something happened Maybe the
tape will tell us

Emerson clicks PLAY The computer speakers pop to life
Over it the sound of heavy labored breathing

Only one left Lights it Takes a drag No satisfaction
He stubs it out on the table

Over the speakers the same FIGHT weve heard before The
shouting Scuffling Three gunshots

Emerson leans in towards the monitor like hes watching a
movie The light from the screen dances off his face

Over his shoulder Katherine steps into the doorway She
knocks on the wall to get his attention

wastebasket nearby

KATHERINE
She made a broadcast around two-
thirty

EMERSON
Shit

He unfolds the paper A long string of numbers is written
from top to bottom An obviously handmade version of the
readouts we saw Katherine reading from earlier

EMERSON
Where did the broadcast go

KATHERINE
Dont know It all works on a relay
system When a code comes in from
the agency it has a frequency at
the top Where the broadcast goes
from thereyoud have to know the
system inside and out to get it
where you wanted

EMERSON
This code Does it look right

He hands her the paper She looks over it

KATHERINE
Could bealways seemed like
nonsense The ciphers that
translate the code are all
different right

EMERSON
Yeah Youd have to know the code
and the cipher

KATHERINE
Besides there has to be safety
measures Right Precautions So
this sort of thing doesnt happen

Emerson fishes through wastebasket Nothing else but
shredded paper

EMERSON
How do you trick an American
operative into killing a high
profile target

KATHERINE
Tell him its an order

paper goes everywhere He slumps against the wall Closes
his eyes Rubs at his temples

drops the pieces into Katherines hand

He walks away from her Hunched No strength in his step

spoonful Katherine takes it back

EMERSON

fifty foot circumference of the floodlight on the roof of

In his peripheral vision off to the left in the brusha
METALLIC GLINT He dives to the ground Rolls to his side

Aims his gun Watcheswaits for movement Sees none

Low to the ground He crawls towards the brush Into the
dry thicket of desert plants Towards the metallic glint

He crawls into a clearing At the center a WOMANS BODY
Her watch REFLECTS the light from the station

Emerson gets to his knee Looks around In the distance a
coyote HOWLS He stands Walks to the body Shes been
shot in the back Her clothes are familiar He turns the

disappears around the corner

For the record his name is DERNE Emerson waits Counts to three Rolls off the corner and

Katherine

SHES BEEN SHOT in the stomach Shes bleeding everywhere
She falls into his arm Gasps for air

KATHERINE

Emerson checks his clipONE BULLET Quickly follows after
Derne He turns the corner No sign of the man

A BULLET cracks the wall right behind Emersons head He
rolls Takes cover behind a conveyor belt More
gunfirefrom his left

Emerson waits for the rhythm of the bullets A short pause
He pops up Cant find a target He ducks back down
Turns to see --

-- A GUN BARREL right in his face --

-- EMERSON KICKS OUTtwistsDerne pulls the trigger as a
reflex The bullet eats a chunk out of Emersons shoulder

But hes able to get to his feet Derne tries to get off
another shotbut hes too slowEmerson disarms him
Ejects the bullet from the chamber Releases the clip
Kicks it across the room

Derne PUMMELS Emerson in the right side In trying to
defend himself he drops his gun It slides across the
floor Under a conveyor belt

Derne grapples Emerson Throws them both onto a conveyor
belt As they ride around the room they pummel on one
another

Derne makes sure to aim for Emersons right sidefor the
bullet wound in his shoulder

Emerson kicks Derne away Elbows him in the face Knees
him the chest Throws Derne from the conveyor belt and
jumps down after him

Emerson charges the guy Lays a combo into face and chest
and neck Derne counters Almost breaks Emersons arm on
the corner of a machine The are a flurry of god-awful
violence

FAST

BRUTAL

They are well trained Well prepared This is the moment
theyve both been training for Derne slams Emersons head
into a wall Emerson boxes his ears in countering

With Derne reeling Emerson scrabbles for his gun Almost
has it Cant quite reach it under the conveyor belt
Derne grabs him by the ankles Pulls him back

Emerson kicks Derne in the facepushes off of his chest
Slides under the conveyor belt Grabs his gun on the way

He grabs a bottle of RUBBING ALCOHOL and pours it over the
bullet wound in her stomach Her whole body lurches in
terrible pain but she has no energy left to scream

He continues to look through the room Finds what he needs
bandage pads gauze and hospital tape He takes them back
over to the medical table

bullet wound He grits his teeth through the pain

He dabs at her wound Cleans around it Presses a wad of
bandage down into the wound Wraps gauze around ittapes

sticking the syringe in her arm and pressing down on the
plunger

He brushes the sticky hair from her face Her eyes flit
open and closed She tries to fight off the drugs Doesnt

She grabs his hand in hers Digs her nails into his palm
Thenshe lets go Her whole body goes limp

Emerson leans down Listens for a pulse against her chest

if hes made all this stuff up in his head He smiles back
Fake Out of sorts

From underneath static and white noise fill the air The
sound is unmistakable It builds throughout

Michaels is silent At first the question doesnt seem to
properly register But soon after he realizes there is no
more pretense

yourself for the cause

EMERSON
It wasnt about me

MICHAELS
Yes Of course The wild card

A car passes in the other direction Both men instinctively
watch it in the mirrors as it drives away

MICHAELS
They break us you know Punish us
Turn us into these awful things
Broken piecesshells They push
us Make us into men that we are
not and then complain when we no
longer function They expect us
toto live like this is normal
Like this is how we should behave
How we should think And our reward
for this life Secrets and
nightmares that wont ever go away
But if we couldif we could sell
them Well fine yesif broken
then also rich

Some loose ends

The static is unbearable

Michaels pops open a small compartment next to the steering
column and pulls out a gun as Emerson lunges across the seat --

EXT DESERT HIGHWAY - DAWN
-- The car swerves wildly out of control Across the lanes
Off the road Down into a sandbank Cant really see

whats going on inside Some sort of struggle

The windows fill with the FLASH of gunfire The shot is
muffled by the car The drivers door opens

For a moment nothing happens Then Michaelss body slumps
out of the car and rolls down the embankment

Emerson gets out of the car Walks around Gets behind the
wheel With a few revs of the engine the wheels catch and
the car takes off down the highway

Emerson drives as fast as he can Pushes the car to its
limits down the highway The needles in the dashboard shake

hand on the wheel the other at his side like his ribs will
fall out otherwise

gold Mont Blanc you keep in your
pocket

-- And stops cold He turns to look at Emerson He knows
that tone Knows hes serious Its not really clear which
way this whole thing is going to go

Gray almost reflexively takes the pen from his pocket to
keep it out of Emersons reach

Then Gray smiles He starts to laugh Comes around the
bed and claps Emerson on the back

GRAY
You really are good at this you
know Shame to see you walk
butnothing personal right

EMERSON
Yeah Sure

GRAY
Just business

EMERSON

Gray opens the door Stops Turns back to Emerson Looks
like he has something really insightful to say

GRAY
Well Alright then

He exits The bruisers fall in step behind him on either
side Emerson leans out into the hall and watches them
leave

GRAY
(to Bruisers)
We were never here

They disappear around the corner

Emerson closes the door Walks to Katherines side Sits
beside the bed Looks around the room Takes it all in

He sits in the silence Looks down at Katherine Brushes

the hair from her face

Then finally he leans back in his chair and closes his
eyes to sleep

FADE OUT
