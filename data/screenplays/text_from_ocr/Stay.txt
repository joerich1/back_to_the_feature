EXT BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- NIGHT

A wrecked Ford Mustang burns in the middle of the empty
bridge Empty No other cars no people in sight

There is a gaping hole in the windshield on the drivers
side Flames consume the backseat Smoke spills out the
windows The radio still plays however The Bands I Shall
be Released

One of the Mustangs front tires has blown out Scraps of
black rubber litter the accident scene

As the camera pulls in we see HENRY LETHAM twenty sitting
in front of the ruined car His eyes are closed

He looks sick-- pale skinny disheveled-- but he has a
presence a magnetism that compels you to look at him

Finally Henry opens his eyes After a moment he stands and
walks away from the burning car never turning around
heading for the illuminated towers of Manhattan

Somewhere nearby a BABY is HOWLING though no one is in
sight

INT MORNINGSIDE HEIGHTS APARTMENT -- MORNING

Tuesday

The babys HOWL continues faintly in the background

DR SAM FOSTER a psychiatrist in his early forties wakes up
in bed disoriented sunlight shining on the disheveled
sheets

For several seconds Sam looks about the apartment confused
as if hes never seen the place before

EXT OLLIES NOODLE SHOP -- 116TH AND BROADWAY -- MORNING

Sam parks his old battered Volvo in front of the Chinese
noodle shop He checks his watch and curses under his breath

Sams hair is beginning to gray but hes still built like a
college tennis player He smiles readily but there is a
brooding quality about him in his dark eyes that suggests
he has seen things most of us have not
EXT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY -- MORNING

The bells are tolling Sam dashes through the campus gates
Under his tweed blazer he wears a frayed navy-blue cable-knit
sweater

As he rounds a corner he checks his watch and before he
looks up collides with LILA CULPEPPER knocking her styrofoam
cup of coffee to the sidewalk

With her stylish haircut and clothing Lila looks more like a
young editor of a fashion magazine than a graduate student
Only the thick philosophy textbooks she carries and her red-
ink stained fingers give her away

She shoves him

LILA
Watch where youre going old man

SAM
Jesus kids these days

He kisses her on the lips

LILA
I dont have time to stand here
flirting with you Ive got to give
a test to Grunbaums undergrads

Sam stoops to pick up the empty cup stands straight
crumples the cup tosses it into a nearby garbage can

SAM
Thank God none of the TAs looked
like you when I was a student I
wouldve flunked every test

LILA
(unimpressed)
Oh thats sweet Can I tell you
something

She sidles up next to him and fixes the collar of his jacket

SAM
What

LILA
You owe me a cup of coffee
EXT TURNER HALL -- MORNING

Sam hurries inside the sleek angular glass-and-steel
building

INT TURNER HALL -- MORNING

Sam gets out of the elevator and waves to a RECEPTIONIST
sitting behind a desk A sign on the wall behind her reads
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY COUNSELING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES

SAM
Hey Toni

TONI
Hey Sam Henry Lethams waiting in
Beths office

SAM
Thanks

He walks down the hallway and opens the last door on the
left

INT BETH LEVYS OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Henry wearing paint-spattered army pants and a black long-
sleeve tee-shirt stands at the window of the bookshelf-lined
office looking out at the sky He stares at Sam when Sam
enters the room Sam smiles and nods

SAM
Henry

HENRY
Wheres Dr Levy

SAM
Dr Levy had an appendectomy
shell be gone a few weeks Im Dr
Foster Im covering for her

Sam offers his hand and Henry examines it for a moment before
shaking Sam goes behind the desk to sit and gestures for
Henry to sit inn one of the facing chairs

Sam pulls a manila folder from his suitcase Henry sits on
the edge of a facing chair He looks ready to bolt at any
second
Henry holds a piece of string which he coils tightly around
his index finger then uncoils then coils again

HENRY
So youre the substitute shrink

Sam smiles

SAM
I guess you could call me that
Does it make you uncomfortable that
Im filling in for Dr Levy

Henry thinks about it coiling the string tightly

HENRY
Is she your girlfriend

SAM
No We were classmates actually
So listen I read your file--

HENRY
Oh really May I read your file

SAM
Fair enough How about you ask me a
question for every question I ask

you

HENRY
How about we dont play stupid
games

Sam smiles and leans back in his chair Far from being
deterred by Henrys attitude hes intrigued He likes
challenges

SAM
Okay Tell me why youre here
HENRY
You read the file You ought to
know
SAM

You torched your car Why

HENRY
I dont know

SAM
What do you mean you dont know
HENRY
I dont remember

SAM
Were you drinking

HENRY
I opened my eyes and I was sitting
in the car and it was on fire

Henry is quiet for a moment remembering

SAM
Do you often set fires

HENRY
No Im not a pyromaniac or
anything Its not like I burned
flies when I was a kid
(beat)
Maybe a couple times I did Is that
bad

SAM
For the flies it is

HENRY
I remember them trying to crawl
when they were on fire

Henry is silent for a moment He coils the string so tightly
around his finger that the tip of his finger turns bright
red

HENRY (CONTD)
Maybe Hell is the place where all
the bad things youve done come
back to get you

Another pause Sam points at Henrys finger

SAM
Youre cutting off the circulation

HENRY
I never meant to hurt anyone

SAM
You were a kid Kids are cruel

HENRY
Im not talking about the flies
SAM
What are you talking about

Abruptly Henry stands knocking over his chair in the
process He bends down to pick it up

HENRY
Sorry I better go

SAM
Are you sure I feel like were
just getting started

HENRY
No no I better--

Henry looks out the window

HENRY (CONTD)
Well have hail this afternoon

Sam watches him leave and then stares out the window The sky
is bright blue

EXT RIVERSIDE PARK -- AFTERNOON

The sky is still blue on this beautiful autumn afternoon Sam
and Lila on rollerblades slowly roll down the promenade
overlooking the Hudson River Lila holds Sams hand
steadying him

Lila is obviously skilled Sam is obviously a beginner He
wears a helmet kneepads and elbow pads over his long-sleeve
tee-shirt

LILA
Dont lean forward too much

SAM
Okay

LILA
Try to relax Youre too tense Try
to get the rhythm You want it to
feel natural

SAM
I have wheels strapped to my feet
Theres nothing natural about it

Two kids on rollerblades whiz by the couple Sam trying to
get out of the way nearly falls
One of the kids begins skating backwards He nudges his
friend and imitates Sams spastic motions Both of them laugh
and zoom away

SAM (CONTD)
Ha ha you little bastards

LILA
We dont have to do this you know
Its supposed to be fun

SAM
Im having fun

He lets go of Lilas hand and tries to skate in the manner of
Eric Heiden pumping his legs with one hand behind his back
going faster and faster

LILA
Sam

Sam now out of control begins speeding downhill

SAM
How do I stop HOW DO I STOP

Ahead of him the path forks left and right He wont be able
to make the turn at this speed

At the last second Sam grabs onto a lamppost He spins
around the post and flops into a bush

LILA
(catching up)
Sam Sam

Sam lies on the ground catching his breath Hes covered
with leaves and dirt

LILA (CONTD)
You okay

Lila crouches beside him and begins checking him for injuries
with the practiced skill of a nurse

SAM
Im fine Im fine

LILA
That was impressive

She lies down next to him
SAM
Maybe Im not ready for this Im
not so coordinated

LILA
Thats okay Youre a sexy klutz

They kiss Lila pulls herself closer her hands on Sams
wrists Abruptly Sam pulls his long sleeves down farther as
if to hide something on his wrists Lila releases him
For a moment both of them are quiet
LILA (CONTD)
You dont have to do that You
dont have to hide from me

Sam doesnt look at her

SAM
Im not hiding

LILA
Sam

Sam raises his head

LILA (CONTD)
Dont hide

She kisses him In the middle of the kiss a loud CRACK
startles both of them

LILA (CONTD)
What was that

For a few seconds nothing happens And then another CRACK
and then another coming rapid fire now grape-size chunks of
ice falling from the sky and shattering on the paved
walkways
SAM

Hail
INT CAR -- NIGHT
DRIVERS POV

We see the road through the drivers eyes Were somewhere in
Brooklyn driving fast through a string of green lights

Everything is very very quiet
We turn to the right A GREEN-EYED WOMAN sits in the
passenger seat She says something but we cant hear a word

She smiles

INT SUBWAY CAR -- AFTERNOON

Henry opens his eyes He sits in a car that shudders and
rattles its way through the underground On his lap is a book
on the artist Tristan Réveur

He pulls a cigarette from a pack and lights it

Next to Henry sleeps a long-haired TEENAGE BOY wearing a
Walkman from the headphones we hear I Shall be Released

Various subway riders glare at Henry and wave away the smoke
obviously annoyed that hes polluting their airspace

A YOUNG WOMAN who wears her blonde hair in dreadlocks sits
across the car watching Henry

YOUNG WOMAN

You go to Columbia right We were
both in Psych 221 Professor
Matthewson

(pointing at his book)
You did your oral presentation on
psychosis and Tristan Réveur
right

Henry stares at her as if shes speaking an alien language A
BUSINESSMAN standing between them holding onto the metal
pole wearing a gray suit and carrying an attache case
shakes his head at Henry

BUSINESSMAN
No smoking on the train

HENRY
What

BUSINESSMAN
(pointing)
Look at the sign fella No smoking
on the train

Henry looks at the sign

INSERT NO SMOKING SIGN

BUSINESSMAN (CONTD)
Capeesh Put it out

HENRY
Capeesh Are you in the Mafia

The businessman leans closer until his face is inches from
Henrys

BUSINESSMAN
Put out the fucking cigarette

Henry slowly rolls his shirtsleeve back from his forearm The
skin is mottled with fresh burns

He draws on his cigarette until its point is red-hot then
stabs it out on the skin of his wrist He does not flinch

The businessman reels backward The dreadlocked Columbia
students mouth drops open The people sitting next to Henry
stand and move away

Henry offers the cigarette butt to the businessman who waves
his hand at it and moves away muttering

BUSINESSMAN (CONTD)
You ought to be locked up

HENRY
I am

When the train pulls into the next station the businessman
and the Columbia caucastafarian hastily depart

INT SAMS BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Bookshelves overflowing with books dominate the space The
one luxurious feature is a working fireplace where a well-
built little fire now burns

Lilas curled up in bed highlighting lines in Dantes
Purgatorio

Sam lying beside her speaks on the PHONE

SAM
Hey Beth this is Sam Hope youre
feeling better I met with your
patient Henry Letham today thought
maybe we could compare notes
Anyway give me a call

He hangs up and stares into the fire his hands folded over
his chest

SAM (CONTD)
(to Lila)
You dont think its a little odd
predicting a hailstorm like that

LILA
(not really paying
attention)
So he watches the Weather Channel

SAM
I looked in the newspaper There
was nothing about any hail today

LILA
Maybe hes a shaman and he did a
little hail dance

SAM
Okay forget it

LILA
(finally looking up)
Hows Beth Levy

SAM
I dont know She hasnt returned
any of my calls

LILA
Hm

SAM
What does hm mean

LILA
She always kind of liked you
didnt she

Sam jabs Lila in the ribs with his finger

SAM
What are you jealous Beths one
of my oldest friends

LILA
Shes your oldest friend thats
supposed to make me unjealous

SAM
Unjealous

LILA
Shes in love Its obvious to
everyone but you And every day you
wear that sweater she made you--

She points at the blue sweater lying folded on top of the
dresser

LILA (CONTD)
--and all I can think is Damn I
cant even knit

SAM
She saved my life sweetheart

LILA
I know

SAM
Youre the only one for me all
right I knew I would find you And
I did

LILA
(kissing him on the lips)
It took you long enough

INT BETH LEVYS OFFICE -- MORNING
Wednesday
Sam sits behind Beths desk and Henry sits facing him

SAM
Have you considered a career in
meteorology

Henry says nothing only stares at the chewed-down stubs of
his fingernails

SAM (CONT D)
The weatherman said something about
the hail

HENRY
I cant listen to the weatherman
anymore I dont understand a word
he says
SAM
You dont understand the
weatherman

HENRY
Do you

SAM
Sure He says rain I bring an
umbrella

Henry stares at Sam for a moment trying to gauge the
psychiatrist He seems to come to a decision

HENRY
I dont know whats real anymore

SAM
Go on
(off Henrys non-response)
Give me a chance Henry Im good
at what I do

HENRY
The voices never stop

SAM
Voices

HENRY
In my head They never stop

SAM
Why were you so reluctant to tell
me that

HENRY

I dont want to fit into your grid
I dont want you saying Okay
paranoid schizophrenic Two hundred
milligrams of Risperdol should do
the trick

SAM
You dont want me making
assumptions about you right

Henry nods

SAM (CONTD)
But arent you making assumptions
about me You think I want to fit
you into a grid

(MORE)

SAM(contd)
I dont make grids I want to know
the particulars about Henry Letham
You hear voices All right thats
important information What are the
voices saying

Henry shakes his head and looks out the window

SAM (CONTD)
I think it might be helpful if you
start writing it down

HENRY
Writing what down

SAM
What the voices are saying Write
down the exact words when you hear
them Okay Henry

Henry hasnt been listening

HENRY
What

SAM
Write down what the voices are
saying

Henry grabs a pen and a pad of paper from the desk and begins
writing

SAM (CONTD)
Theyre talking to you now

Henry continues writing furiously When he finishes he stares
at his own jagged cursive

SAM (CONTD)
Can I see

Henry hands the pad over Sam studies it straining to read
the handwriting

SAM (CONTD)

(reading)
Write down what the voices are
saying Theyre talking to you

now

(looking at Henry)
That wasnt a hallucination that
was me talking

HENRY
You come inside my head Doctor
and show me how to tell the
difference

SAM
(continuing to read)
Stay Henry stay Stay Stay
Stay
(looking at Henry)
Youre hearing this voice now

Henry nods rubbing his palm over his scarred forearm

SAM (CONTD)
Do you recognize the voice

HENRY
Yes

SAM
Who is it

HENRY

I dont know

SAM
You just said you did

HENRY
Its a woman I know her but I
dont know who she is

SAM
I dont understand

Henry says nothing only scratches his forearm Sam notices
the fresh burn on Henrys arm He stands goes around the
desk gently takes Henrys arm and inspects it

SAM (CONTD)
Whats this from

HENRY
I burned myself

Sam looks closer He notices the old burn scars that
constellate Henrys forearms

SAM
(more firmly)
What are these scars from

Absently Henry looks at his forearms

HENRY
Cigarettes I guess

SAM
Why do you have cigarette scars on
your forearms

HENRY
Because I keep burning myself

Sam nods and studies Henry for a moment He releases Henrys
arm and sits on the edge of the desk

SAM
Why do you want to hurt yourself

HENRY
I guess its practice

SAM
Practice for what

HENRY
For Hell

Sam takes a deep breath and exhales

SAM
You think youre going to Hell

Henry nods

SAM (CONTD)
Why

HENRY
Because of what I did

SAM
What did you do

Henry shakes his head stares out the window

SAM (CONTD)
Whatever it is we--

HENRY
I know youre trying to help me
Doctor And thank you But its too
late

SAM
Why is it too late

Henry stands and grabs his bookbag off the floor

HENRY
Saturday at midnight Im going to
kill myself

He rubs his arms and smiles

HENRY (CONTD)
I need to get ready

He walks out leaving a stunned Sam alone in the room

INT COLUMBIA PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL -- AFTERNOON

Sam walks down the corridor of the Mental Health Ward He
knocks on an office door marked Mobile Crisis Unit No
answer As hes about to knock again he hears a commotion at
the end of the hallway

Two strapping PARAMEDICS are wrestling a fiercely agitated
heavy-set woman DAISY toward one of the rooms She appears
to be homeless wearing layer upon layer of filthy clothing
her hair matted her skin dirty and bruised

Standing beside the paramedics DOCTOR SCHLEGEL a gaunt man
with a sparse goatee tries to calm the woman

DR SCHLEGEL
Come on Daisy Weve got your
television turned on and
everything Take it easy

DAISY
I AM NOT A NAZI I AM NOT A NAZI
GODDAMN YOU

DR SCHLEGEL
Nobodys calling you a Nazi Daisy
Come on now

Sam hurries down the corridor toward the disturbance Daisy
falls to the floor and the paramedics unable to force her
into the room try to hold her still as she thrashes in their
arms

Dr Schlegel has prepared a hypodermic and now crouches
waiting for an opportunity to stick Daisy

DAISY
I AM NOT A NAZI

DR SCHLEGEL
I know it Daisy I know it

DAISY
(beginning to sob)
You cant treat me this way I am
not a Nazi I dont deserve this

DR SCHLEGEL
Believe it or not sweetheart its
for your own good

The paramedics hold her tight and Schlegel sticks the needle
in Daisys arm

DR SCHLEGEL (CONT’D)
If youd remember to take your
pills we wouldnt have to go
through this every month

DAISY
Im not a Nazi Im lovable

DR SCHLEGEL
You are

DAISY
(already beginning to
fade)
Im lovable

The paramedics hoist Daisy to her feet and lead her
peacefully into the bedroom

Dr Schlegel sees Sam for the first time and smiles a little
embarrassed

DR SCHLEGEL
Hey Sam The glamorous world of
psychiatry huh

They shake hands and Schlegel leads Sam back toward the
Mobile Crisis Unit office

DR SCHLEGEL (CONTD)
So what brings you to Club Meds

SAM
I wanted to check the protocol on
involuntary committal

(MORE )
SAM(contd)

kill himself

DR SCHLEGEL
Jesus tell him to take a number
Well the rules are pretty
straightforward If he says hes
gonna hurt himself or someone else
we can take him in But we can only
hold him here for forty-eight
hours

SAM
Forty-eight hours What are we
going to do in forty-eight hours

They stop outside the MCU office

DR SCHLEGEL

Hold his hand feed him some pills

(beat)
If we catch him in the actual
attempt thats different Hes
broken the law But just based on a
threat Without a court order we
cant keep him for long

SAM
He wants to do it Saturday at
midnight If we take him in now

DR SCHLEGEL

fun process If theres any way to
avoid it avoid it What do you

(MORE)

SAM(contd)
He wants to die Jeff Ive got
three days to convince him not to

EXT TWELFTH STREET -- DUSK

Sam is walking home when he stops to watch PIANO MOVERS at
work Using ropes and pulleys they hoist a Bechstein baby
grand toward the open windows of a fourth-floor apartment

PIANO MOVER 1 acts as the foreman issuing commands

PIANO MOVER 1
Easy easy

A small BOY accompanied by his MOTHER runs down the street
holding a red balloon He trips and falls and the balloon
begins to float away

BOY
(yelling at escaping
balloon)
Wait Wait

The piano movers hear the boys cries and see the balloon
Piano Mover 1 makes a valiant effort to capture the escaping
balloon he runs after it and leaps but he cant quite
reach it

Everyone watches the red balloon drift skyward
PIANO MOVER 1
Sorry kid Its gone to balloon
heaven
Sam smiles and enters his building where the DOORMAN greets
him
INT SAMS APARTMENT -- DUSK
Lila meets Sam at the door and kisses him on the lips

Lila curls up at the foot of her bed and watches as Sam grabs
a bundle of twigs from beside the fireplace and starts laying
down the kindling

LILA
Only because I never lived in
Northern New Jersey

Sam begins stacking the logs

LILA (CONT D)

Sam rolls an old newspaper and inserts it beneath the stacked
logs

LILA

Sam strikes a match and lights the fire

SAM

LILA
Why does he want to do it on
Saturday Whats so special about
midnight Saturday

Sam watches the kindling catch

SAM
He left before I could ask

Confident that the fire is in good shape Sam walks over to
the bedside table picks up the phone and dials a number He
waits for a moment and then shakes his head

SAM (CONTD)
(on phone)

from Sam He reads the contract quickly signs his name and
hands it back to Sam He pockets the card

HENRY

Sam bewildered looks at the contract for a moment and then
sets it aside

SAM
Why Saturday

HENRY

SAM
I think the tradition is to go out

out

HENRY
Have you heard of Tristan Réveur

everyone he would live three more
years and then go to New York and
kill himself And thats exactly
what he did He came to New York

silent

We turn to the road again The bridge is waiting for us

EXT CENTRAL PARK ZOO -- AFTERNOON
MONTAGE

Henry enters the Zoo beneath the Delacorte Clock the bronze
animals playing their instruments marking the hour

Henry watches a lone silverback GORILLA who sits on a large
rock staring back at Henry

Henry sits on a park bench watching an OLD MAN throw bread
crumbs to a horde of squawking pigeons

Henry sits in the last row of the bleachers overlooking the
seal pool The front rows are filled with screaming CHILDREN

On an island in the middle of the pool TRAINERS toss fish to
the SEALS as rewards for various tricks clapping their
flippers jumping through hoops kissing each other
balancing balls on their noses

INT POLAR BEAR TANK -- AFTERNOON

We see a blurred Henry through the window of a polar bear
tank The BEAR is swimming laps never pausing

Its an oddly graceful animal bulky but elegant flipping at
each end of the pool to kick off the wall (one wall being the
window that Henry stands behind)

EXT POLAR BEAR TANK -- AFTERNOON
Henry seems mesmerized by the bears endless swim A well-
dressed ENGLISHMAN and ENGLISHWOMAN approach and watch the
bear perform its laps
ENGLISHMAN
(to Henry)
You suppose hes bored
HENRY
I think hes trying to forget where
he is

The Englishman nods and they all watch the bear in silence
for a moment

INT POLAR BEAR TANK

The polar bear glides soundlessly through the water ignoring
the blurred faces beyond the glass

EXT POLAR BEAR TANK

Somewhere nearby a BABY is howling Henry looks around but
there is no baby in sight

ENGLISHMAN
And is it working

Henry looks at the Englishman
HENRY
Its hard to forget where you are

Both the man and his wife smile at Henry and walk away Henry
watches them go

The unseen baby continues to howl

Oh
(beat)
Thats a joke right

HENRY
Yes sir

Sam leads Henry inside

INT HUNGARIAN CAFE -- CONTINUOUS

A small dark cafe where STUDENTS and PROFESSORS drink coffee
and eat homemade pastries Bad art lines the walls

Henry and Sam find seats in a corner of the room far away
from everyone else

The song playing on the radio ends the new song is I Shall
be Released

Henry sits up straight when he hears the song He stares at
the nearest stereo speaker as if trying to figure something
out

HENRY
I cant escape this song
(looking at Sam)
Why did you want to meet here

SAM
The Hungarian Cafe Sentimental
favorite When I was an undergrad I
worked here
(pointing)
I lost my virginity under that
table

HENRY
(shocked)
You what

SAM
I used to lock up every night So
one time I brought my girlfriend
here and we had a bottle of wine
and you know one thing led to
another It wasnt very
comfortable

Henry laughs and shakes his head

HENRY
I never had a shrink tell me
something like that

SAM
(looking up at the
artworks)
They still have the same bad art on
the walls

HENRY
(looking at the art)
Tristan Réveur used to say that bad
art is more tragically beautiful
than good art because bad art
documents human failure

SAM

I dont know about this Tristan
Réveur guy I think you ought to
choose your role models a little
more carefully

(beat very sober now)
You do understand that Im required
by law to report anyone who
physically threatens himself or
others

Henry laughs

SAM (CONTD)
Whats funny

HENRY
You take all this so seriously

SAM
Should I not take it seriously Is
that what youre telling me Is
this a joke

HENRY
Im not talking about Saturday I
am going to die on Saturday I just
mean your role The psychiatrist
You play it well

Sam considers this for a moment

SAM
Why do you think Im playing a
role

Henry smiles but does not answer

SAM (CONTD)
Are you playing a role The
Suicidal Romantic Whyd you choose
that role Why do you want to die

The smile disappears from Henrys face He rubs his palm over
the burns on his forearm

HENRY
I dont want to keep hurting
people

SAM

Who did you hurt

HENRY
I dont know

Henry is becoming more and more distraught He stares at the
floor picks at his fingernails But Sam wont let it rest --
he knows hes on to something important

SAM
Have you done something Henry
Youve hurt someone

HENRY
I dont know Maybe

SAM
You do know What have you done

Henry still staring at the floor begins to shake his head
violently

SAM (CONTD)
Is that why youre thinking about
suicide Is that it You need to
punish yourself What happened

HENRY
I dont remember

SAM
You dont want to remember But you
have to You cant escape from the
truth Whatever it is youve done
you have to face it

Suddenly Henry stops shaking his head and looks straight at
Sam a strange smile on his face

HENRY
If I cant escape from the truth
were all in serious trouble Dr
Foster

EXT HAMILTON LAWN -- COLUMBIA CAMPUS -- AFTERNOON
Sam and DR LEON PATTERSON a middle-aged blind man wearing
dark glasses sit on folding chairs facing each other over a

fold-away chess table

A small radio on the grass plays Billy Holiday Sam moves his
queen

SAM
Queen to g4

LEON
Billy Holiday I remember her
singing at the Five Spot years

ago
SAM
I wish I could have heard her
LEON
Yes Well I wish I could have seen
her
SAM

Here I want to show you something
Give me your hand

Sam pulls a small pale-blue Tiffanys box from his blazer
pocket opens it pulls out a diamond ring and hands it to
Leon

Leon rotates the ring between his fingers and rubs the stone

LEON
Its certainly a very hard diamond

SAM
Thats what I asked for I said
Give me the hardest diamond youve
got

Leon hands the ring back to Sam and then claps him on the
shoulder

LEON
Congratulations Sam Im very
happy for you Does she know

Sam returns the ring to his blazer pocket

SAM
Not yet I want the mood to be
right before I propose The last
few days Im having a hard time
with one of Beth Levys patients
He wants to kill himself Saturday
night

LEON
Henry Letham

SAM
(surprised)
You know him

LEON
Beth told me about him Hes been
planning this suicide for quite
some time The good news is hes
still meeting with you Hes
looking for help

SAM
Youve been shrinking heads for
thirty years I figured you could
give me some ideas

LEON
Knight to c3 Check

Sam moves Leons knight for him and studies the chess board
LEON (CONTD)

Do you remember the dream of the
burning boy that Freud refers to

SAM
Vaguely

LEON
Vaguely meaning no

SAM
Right

LEON

He describes a man whose child is
dying The father sits by the boys
bed night after night mopping the
sweat from the boys forehead
bringing him water to drink All
for nothing After the child dies
they give him a wake set up a
circle of candles around his body
The father is exhausted of course
He goes to sleep in the next room
And he dreams that his boy stands
beside him holding his arm and
whispering Father cant you see
that Im burning When the man
wakes up he runs into the next room
and sees that one of the candles
has fallen onto the shroud and set
the dead boy on fire

SAM
He noticed the heat or the light
and his unconscious figured out a
fire had started

LEON
Probably Thats the logical
explanation But whats
interesting what interested Freud
is the way the fathers unconscious
dealt with that knowledge Some
part of him knew that a fire had
started but rather than waking
immediately he created a dream-
version of his child to act as a
messenger

SAM
He wanted his boy alive again The
fire could wait a moment he wanted
his boy to stay with him What made
you think of it

Leon smiles tapping his cane on the floor in time with the
beat

LEON
I never stop thinking about it I
heard that story fifty years ago
and I still cant get it out of my
mind Our imagination wants to
protect us from everything

A shadow falls over the chess board and Sam turns around
Henry stands behind him staring at Leon Henrys face is
even paler than usual his eyes wide in disbelief

Sam stands and grips Henrys shoulder
SAM
Henry Didnt expect to see you Do

you know Doctor Patterson

Leon rises from his chair and extends his hand in Henrys
direction

LEON
Hello Henry

Henry ignores the offered hand He cant take his eyes off
the old mans face
SAM
(to Henry)
Whats the matter

HENRY
(to Leon in a dazed
whisper )
What are you doing here

Leon is confused unsure whether hes being spoken to or not

He withdraws his extended hand

LEON
Excuse me

HENRY
Youre dead

Leon is puzzled for a moment but smiles

LEON
Not yet Im happy to say Dr
Foster Ill leave you two in
peace Well finish the game later
yes

Leon walks away tapping the ground before him with his cane

SAM
Are you all right Here take a
seat

Henry remains standing He watches Leon disappear around a

corner before turning on Sam

HENRY
Youre playing games with me

SAM
What are you talking about
Nobodys playing games

HENRY
(furious )
Why did you bring him here Are you
torturing me

SAM
Henry--

HENRY
What are you doing to me

SAM
What are you talking about

HENRY
Thats my father goddamn you

Sam stares at Henry for a moment and then sits

SAM
Dr Patterson never married He has
no children

HENRY
I know my father

SAM
Listen--

HENRY
You think I wouldnt recognize my
own father

SAM
I thought you told me your father
was dead

HENRY

He is dead He died and they buried
him and that was him sitting here

SAM
Henry think about it for a minute
Dr Patterson is alive and well

Henry doesnt say anything for a while He rubs his scarred
forearms in silence Finally gesturing at the campus about
them the buildings and trees and students

HENRY
Everything you believe is a lie

SAM
Then tell me the truth

Henry closes his eyes for a moment
HENRY
Your troubles will cease and

fortune will smile upon you

Sam stares at the student perplexed

SAM
Where did that come from

But Henry is already walking away

EXT CORNING DORMITORY -- LATER

Sam and a CUSTODIAN stand by the entrance A specially-marked
Mobile Crisis Unit ambulance pulls up Dr Schlegel steps
out followed by the two burly paramedics from before

SAM
We cant wait any longer

DR SCHLEGEL
Lets do it

All four men enter the building

INT DORMITORY HALLWAY

Sam knocks on the door to room 313 There is no sound from
within

The custodian flips through the keys on his massive key ring
The other men wait in silence

CUSTODIAN
Here we go

He slips the master key into the lock and opens the door

INT HENRYS DORM ROOM

The room is very dark The custodian walks over to a window
and pulls the shade up Weak sunlight streams in

CUSTODIAN
Jesus

The room is small and almost empty there is a bare mattress
in one corner and a chair by the window

A phone and answering machine are on the chair
Every inch of the walls and ceiling is covered with minuscule
handwriting an endless loop of black ink Sam steps closer

to the wall and examines it

The phrase FORGIVE ME repeated again and again and again

The paramedics exchange glances Dr Schlegel studies the
handwriting carefully Something on the floor catches his eye
and he stoops to pick it up

DR SCHLEGEL
Trouble

Dr Schlegel hands a small box to Sam
INSERT EMPTY BOX OF 38 CALIBER CARTRIDGES
Sam walks over to the answering machine
INSERT PHONE MACHINE

The number 1 is flashing in the LED display

Sam looks at Dr Schlegel who nods Sam pushes the play
button

For a moment there is nothing but static In the background
we hear a murmur of voices and distant sirens After a few
seconds of this a female voice

FEMALE VOICE
Stay Henry stay stay stay Henry
stay stay stay Henry stay stay stay
Henry stay stay stay Henry stay
stay stay Henry stay stay stay
Henry stay

EXT DORMITORY

Sam and Dr Schlegel stand alone on the steps while the
paramedics stand in front of the ambulance smoking
cigarettes and watching the COLLEGE GIRLS stroll by

SAM
Now what

DR SCHLEGEL
Not much we can do at this point
We dont have the manpower for a
stakeout or anything like that
Ill notify the police but they
wont do anything

SAM
Why not

DR SCHLEGEL
Because theyre New York City cops
thats why not Theyve got more
important things to do than look
for depressed college students

SAM
Then I1l find him

DR SCHLEGEL
Okay If you spot him give me a
call and well pick him up for you
But do me a favor Sam

SAM
Whats that

DR SCHLEGEL
Be careful A guy this far gones
got nothing to lose

INT CAR - NIGHT

DRIVERS POV

Were on the ramp leading up to the Brooklyn Bridge The
Gothic towers massive and imposing rise above us Its
late traffic is light and were moving fast

INT CATHEDRAL OF ST JOHN THE DIVINE -- LATE AFTERNOON
Henry sits head bowed eyes closed in a forward pew of the
enormous cathedral An enthusiastic blonde TOUR GUIDE is

leading a group of Midwestern TOURISTS up the nave pointing
out the sights

TOUR GUIDE
The largest stained glass window
above the entry-way -- looks like a

kaleidoscope doesnt it --
contains over three thousand
separate pieces of glass Some of
the best craftsmen from around the
world have worked on the Cathedral
of St John the Divine but its a
long way from finished It wont be
complete for at least another
century

The tour group exits the cathedral leaving Henry alone in
the building He raises his head toward the ceiling

HENRYS POV

The roof of the cathedral is so high and the lighting so
poor that its impossible to see the ceiling

From somewhere inside the building a BABYS howl echoes
Henry looks around wondering where the sound is coming from
He gets up and begins to follow the noise

Everywhere he goes statues of the saints stare down at him
unsmiling

No matter where he stands the babys howl seems just as far
away He walks up the nave toward the entrance

The cathedral is very dark the nave very long His footsteps
echo off the stone walls Finally he reaches daylight and
exits

EXT CATHEDRAL

Henry examines the hallucinogenic peace fountain on the
cathedrals grounds Saint Michael winged and victorious and
sword-wielding has just decapitated Satan whose headless
body is plunging into the abyss

Henry walks over to the fenced-off garden behind the Peace
Fountain The one PEACOCK in Manhattan lives in this garden

Henry behind the fence watches it strutting about fanning
its gorgeous array of feathers

BOY (0S)
Mommy is that man going to die

Henry wheels about The small BOY we last saw holding a red
balloon stands a few yards away holding his MOTHERS hand

He has a new red balloon

Both mother and child stare at Henry Finally the mother tugs
her son away but the child continues to stare over his
shoulder at Henry

INT SAMS APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Sam sits at the kitchen table The documents from Henrys

folder are spread out before him transcripts application
materials etc

Sam studies a passport photograph of Henry for a moment then
continues to sift through the material while Lila sitting on
the opposite side of the table eats take-out Chinese food

SAM
(examining a memo)
He refused to take the mandatory
swim test Maybe hes afraid of

water
LILA
(chewing)
Mm
SAM

Citations for Studio Art
Apparently hes an accomplished
painter

LILA
Did you ever hear from Beth Levy

SAM
No Listen to this Of all the
students I have encountered at
Columbia Henry Letham has the most
fertile imagination If he
maintains his concentration he will
create new worlds with his art

LILA
Clearly that professor wants to
fuck Henry Letham

Sam still paging through the documents laughs

SAM
Theres the graduate student
cynicism I know and love

LILA
What exactly are you doing baby

Sam looks up at her

SAM
What do you mean

LILA
Youre letting this kid take over
your life Its not your job to
track down missing students

Sam is quiet for a moment

SAM
Whose job is it

LILA
I just dont think its healthy to
be so obsessed with one patient

SAM
I dont think its healthy either
But if I dont help him no one
else will Hes alone in the world

LILA
Maybe youre right Maybe I ama
cynic But it seems to me that hes
using you
(beat)
You want your fortune cookie

SAM
Its all yours

Lila cracks open the cookie and pulls out the fortune

LILA
(reading)
Your troubles will cease and
fortune will smile upon you

Sam slowly looks up at her All the color has drained from
his face

LILA (CONTD)
And not a moment too soon thats
all I can say
(noticing Sams
expression)
Whats the matter baby Sam

INT APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY -- NIGHT
Sam stands outside an apartment door holding the Henry
Letham folder He rings the doorbell No answer He rings

INT BETHS BEDROOM -- LATER

Sam has managed to get Beth into bed She sleeps now while
Sam sits at the foot of the bed looking through papers from
Henrys folder

He dials a number on his CELL PHONE

SAM

Sam stares at the cell phone He dials the number again and
listens Nobody answers

BETH (0S)

Sam turns and sees Beth sitting up in bed watching him She
is calmer now but her eyes are still bloodshot and wild

SAM
He lied to me

BETH

Trust me Sam-- the truth is worse

than the lie
EXT GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE -- NIGHT
We watch the battered old Volvo glide over the Hudson
beneath the lighted suspension cables
EXT SUBURBAN ROAD -- NIGHT

EXT LETHAM HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Sam gets out of the car and walks to the doorstep The house
is dark Sam rings the doorbell No answer He rings again

MRS LETHAM (0S)
Ive been waiting for you

Sam spins around MRS LETHAM sits in the darkness on a porch
swing She wears a silk kerchief around her head the kind
that chemotherapy patients sometimes wear

SAM
Mrs Letham Im Dr Sam Foster I
called before
(beat)
Sorry to bother you at this hour
but its an emergency

MRS LETHAM
I thought youd never come visit

She stands and approaches Sam She has a limp Shes a kind-
looking woman but weary with dark circles below her blue
eyes and wisps of gray hair straying out from under the
kerchief

SAM
I would have called earlier

even know you were alive

MRS LETHAM
I guess its easy to forget me all
alone out here in the country

SAM
Your sons not well Thats what

Mrs Letham laughs but the laugh turns into a cough She
limps to the front door

MRS LETHAM
I know why you came Not because of
me You came to see Olive didnt
you

Sam frowns

SAM
Olive

MRS LETHAM
I know you did

She opens the door flicks on a light and leads him inside
In the light we can see that Mrs Letham has a wine-stain
birthmark on her left cheek
INT LETHAM FOYER -- CONTINUOUS

The house is immaculate The windows are spotless the
chandelier by the staircase glitters the hardwood floor is
polished and gleaming

But there is no furniture to be seen anywhere
Lethams footsteps echo in the empty house

A black Neapolitan MASTIFF pads into

the newcomer The dog is massive at least 160

slobber-jawed

SAM
(under his breath)

Jesus

MRS LETHAM

Here she is Shes been lonely Me
and Olive keep each other company
It feels like weve been alone in

this house for a thousand years

SAM
Hey Olive How you doing girl

The mastiff stares at him impassively

MRS LETHAM
She doesnt remember you anymore

Let me fix you something to eat I

But Mrs Letham limps into the kitchen anyway and Sam is

forced to follow her Olive pads in after them

INT LETHAM

The kitchen

Mrs Letham

KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

shines like the rest of the house

Someone has

scrubbing every surface until it gleams

opens the refrigerator and looks through it

The refrigerator is empty

MRS LETHAM
Most days I dont say a single

Suddenly Mrs Letham seems close to tears She closes the
refrigerator and looks at Sam

Mrs

MRS LETHAM

Letham smiles and takes Sams hand

MRS LETHAM

Sam is quiet for a moment searching Mrs Lethams smiling

face

SAM
Who do you think I am Mrs Letham

MRS LETHAM

SAM

MRS LETHAM
You think I dont know you Henry

Mrs Letham wraps her arms around Sam and squeezes him to

her

MRS LETHAM (CONTD)
Oh Lord I missed you I missed you

hurt me

Sam nods He speaks very quietly very carefully They are
still locked in an embrace

SAM

MRS LETHAM

MRS LETHAM

SAM
Where do I go on the weekends

MRS LETHAM

Abruptly Mrs Letham goes cool She breaks off the hug

MRS LETHAM

(increasingly angry)
Now you might not even graduate

SAM
Do you remember where Athena lives

MRS LETHAM
Athena this Athena that always
Athena beautiful Athena Im sick
of Athena Im sick of her

SAM
Mrs Letham--

Sam abruptly stops talking seeing what we now see Blood
trickles down the side of Mrs Lethams face leaking from
underneath her kerchief

A large drop of the blood falls and splatters on the white-
tiled floor

Mrs Letham sees the blood and grabs a sponge from the sink
She drops to her knees and begins violently scrubbing at the
spot on the floor

MRS LETHAM
How could you Your own mother how
could you
Meanwhile the blood is beginning to stream down her face She
scrubs ferociously but more and more blood spatters on the
tiles

Sam kneels beside her

SAM
Let me look at your head

When he reaches for her kerchief she slaps away his hand and
snarls

MRS LETHAM
You did this

Olive leaps upon Henry knocking him to the floor biting
viciously at his face and throat

Sam desperately holds the mastiff off the slobbering jaws
inches from his jugular

Mrs Letham watches for a few seconds before speaking

MRS LETHAM (CONTD)
Olive Off

Upon her command the mastiff immediately disengages and
retreats Sam bleeds from the hands neck and face

MRS LETHAM (CONTD)
You better leave Henry Youre not
welcome anymore

SHERIFF
Yes sir she did
EXT WEST 44TH STREET -- NIGHT
Henry walks down one of the few blocks near Times Square that

still looks like the old Times Square erotic bookshops peep
shows adult theaters

Everyone else on the street is dressed for the cold night
but Henry still wears the same T-shirt hes had on all day
He doesnt seem to notice the cold

He looks up at the marquee of a porn movie theater INT
PORNO THEATER -- NIGHT

He walks down the aisle and finds a seat in the front row We
hear the soundtrack the usual moans and gasps over the usual
cheesy music

CLOSE ON HENRY

We watch Henrys face bathe in the flickering light from the
screen

Henry looks weary His hair lies flat and wet across his
scalp Now below the synthesized music and the grunting we
hear a low and distant thump

The thump slowly gets louder-- its a heartbeat Louder and
louder until all other sound is masked

Finally we see the screen A FETUS curled up within its
mothers womb silently swimming in the amniotic fluid

We pull back to see the other viewers in the theater Many of
them are asleep street people who went inside to escape the
cold

Those still awake stare at the screen as if nothing strange
were happening A grizzled old VETERAN in an army jacket Two
TEENS from the suburbs wearing their varsity jackets An
OBESE MAN peering through coke-bottle lenses

And we go back to Henry who sits silently watching the
screen

Back on screen a montage of a life in the form of brief
clips from what could have been home movies

A hospital nurse presents the baby boy to his mother The boy
rattles the bars of his crib The boy takes his first steps

HENRY
(under his breath)
Stop

In each new image the boy is slightly older Sledding down a
snowy hill Blowing out candles on a cake

Henry turns to look at the projector lighting the screen
with its story

HENRY (CONTD)
Please stop it

On screen the boy raising his hand in class Down by the
shore throwing a tennis ball for Olive (the mastiff looks
exactly like she did when we first saw her) Kissing a girl
for the first time (judging from his closed eyes and hesitant
pucker) Reading a novel Stealing second base Drinking
whiskey with his friends

Henry tormented by what he sees on screen keeps looking
back at the projectors white light

HENRY (CONTD)
Stop Stop Turn it off

On screen the boy smoking a cigarette (and now if we
havent before we recognize that its a younger Henry on
screen) Arriving for his first day of freshman year at
Columbia Shooting pool with friends in a smoky bar Sitting
in the bleachers cheering for the New York Yankees

HENRY (CONTD)
(beginning to sob)
Stop Stop

Walking down Broadway with the GREEN-EYED WOMAN whom we
recognize from the drivers POV sequences

Driving across the Brooklyn Bridge with the green-eyed woman
and two passengers in back whose faces we cant make out

HENRY (CONT D)
(sobbing barely able to
speak)
Stop stop

A terrible noise fills the theater-- steel colliding with
steel at high speed The screen goes black

Henry bolts up from his seat and runs from the theater

After a few seconds two words appear on the bottom of the
screen a subtitle

FORGIVE ME

The subtitle does not fade away The men in the theater stare
at the screen Nobody says a word

EXT TWELFTH STREET -- DAWN

Sam parks his car down the block from his building and walks
toward home Halfway there he stops to watch piano movers at
work across the street

They are the same piano movers we saw before and they seem
to be hauling the same piano into the same apartment

PIANO MOVER 1
Easy easy

Sam stops in his tracks He has been here before

A small boy accompanied by his mother runs down the street
holding a red balloon He trips and falls and the balloon
begins to float away

BOY
Wait Wait

The workmen hear the boys cries and see the balloon Piano
Mover 1 makes a valiant effort to capture the escaping
balloon he runs after it and leaps but he cant quite
reach it

Sam stares at the rising balloon in disbelief

PIANO MOVER 1
Sorry kid Its gone to balloon
heaven

Everything but the time of day is the same the cars in the
street the kids crestfallen expression the red balloon
disappearing into the gray sky

Sam runs across the street and confronts Piano Mover 1
SAM

You were here on Thursday You were

moving this piano on Thursday too
The man is engaged in the difficult business of hoisting a
piano into a fourth-floor apartment and doesnt have time for
this kind of banter
He looks briefly at Sam and then back to the Bechstein

PIANO MOVER 1
Can I help you with something pal

SAM
That kid with the balloon the
exact same thing happened on
Thursday

PIANO MOVER 1
Were a little busy here Why dont
you go bother someone else

Sam watches the workmen on the fourth floor ease the piano
into position

INT SAMS APARTMENT -- MORNING

Sam staggers in the front door exhausted Lila comes out of
the bedroom She stops in her tracks when she sees him all
bandaged and battered then hurries over to him

LILA
What happened to you

Sam shakes his head How can he possibly explain what has
happened to him He limps toward the bedroom Lila
nonplussed follows after him

INT SAMS BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

LILA
I was calling people all over the
city looking for you I was about
to call the police

Sam checks the clock 812 am He begins to undress pulling
off his sweater

LILA (CONTD)
Whats going on Sam

Sam sits on the edge of the bed considering the question

SAM
I dont know

LILA
I dont know You run out in the
middle of the night and dont come
back until eight in the morning no
phone call no explanation looking
like someone tried to murder you
Dont tell me I dont know

Sam lies down on the bed his clothes half-removed Hes too
exhausted to have a real conversation too bewildered by the
events of the last few hours too numbed from the Percoset

SAM
You want a better answer ask
someone else

LILA
Excuse me

SAM
Lila Im seeing things that dont
make any sense Okay Im meeting
people that are supposed to be
dead Beth Levys had a nervous
breakdown and this kid Im supposed
to be treating knows whats going
to happen before it happens

LILA
You were at Beth Levys all night

Sam groans

LILA (CONTD)
Youre losing me Sam I swear to
God youre starting to lose me

Sam grunts already half-asleep

LILA (CONTD)
(heavy sarcasm)
Im glad we had this conversation
I think we really cleared the air
on some important issues
(jangling the car keys)
Im going to the library

SAMS FIRST DREAM

The screen goes black And then bright white The white
gradually resolves and we see that were staring into the
glare of a small flashlight

The flashlight disappears and Sams face replaces it Sams
face looming large staring directly into the camera

SAM
Can you hear me Henry Henry Im
a doctor Im going to help you
Can you hear me

END OF SAMS FIRST DREAM

Sam opens his eyes Hes lying on his bed still half-
clothed He looks at the clock 3 pm He sits straight up
Hes running out of time

INT SAMS APARTMENT -- AFTERNOON

Sam prepares to leave after having showered and changed
clothes (though he still wears the sweater he always wears)

He looks at himself in the foyer mirror His eyes are
haunted

INT HALLWAY -- AFTERNOON

Sam pushes the elevator button and waits The door slides
open

Henry stands there He slept on the street and it shows Sam
stumbles backward

SAM
Jesus Christ
(beat)
What are you doing here How did
you know where I live

The doors start to slide shut and Sam gets into the elevator
They descend

SAM (CONTD)

Ive been looking all over for you
I saw your mother last night

Henry seems uninterested

SAM (CONTD)
You told me she was dead

Henry stares at Sam never blinking
SAM (CONTD)
Everyone seems to think your
mothers dead But I was standing
in her kitchen talking to her

Sam indicates the bandages on his neck

SAM (CONTD)
I met Olive

HENRY
Olives dead too We put her to
sleep when I was twelve She had a
tumor in her liver

SAM
Olives not dead She is very much
not dead

HENRY

She was a good girl She used to
kill the rabbits

Sam grabs Henry and presses him against the wall of the
elevator

SAM
Quit playing with me

HENRY
(with mock surprise)
Doctor Foster

SAM
I want to know whats going on How
do you know the future

HENRY
I make it up

The door opens onto the seventh-floor A MUSLIM WOMAN in full
veil looks into the elevator Sam releases Henry The woman
decides not to get in

Everyone is silent until the doors slide shut again

SAM
Ever since I met you impossible
things have been happening Im
trying to help you but it feels
like Im losing my mind
(beat)
What happened to your parents

Henry shrugs

SAM (CONTD)
Theres something you want to tell
me Why cant you admit that If
you just wanted to kill yourself
youd have already done it So why
dont you Why do you keep coming
to me

HENRY
Because youre the only one who can
help me

Henry looks down at the cigarette burns marking his forearms
HENRY (CONTD)

You want to know why I keep burning
my arms

SAM
Yes
HENRY
I want to see if Ill feel any
pain
SAM
Do you
HENRY
Nothing

Sam looks up at the floor indicator lights Henry looks up as
well 321

INT LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS

They exit the elevator in the lobby and stand in front of a
mirrored wall

HENRY
I showed you my scars Now lets
see yours

Sam frowns and touches the bandage on his neck but Henry
shakes his head

HENRY (CONTD)
No your old scars

Sam is silent

HENRY (CONTD)
Come on dont be shy

SAM
How do you know about that

Henry says nothing Finally Sam rolls up the cuffs of his
shirt He holds his arms in front of him palms up

Three narrow scars carve up each wrist Henry looks at them
for a moment and then Sam rolls the cuffs back and buttons
them

SAM (CONTD)
First year of medical school I
read somewhere youre supposed to
do it in warm water to make the
blood flow quicker I was always a
good reader So I filled the tub
and I cut my wrists and I waited
Beth Levy found me She was in the
room across the hall she came over
to borrow a textbook She dragged
me out of the bath and she put
tourniquets on my arms and she
called an ambulance Id lost six
pints of blood by then but they
saved me They sewed me up and I
was good as new

For the first time Sam has Henrys complete attention The
young man stares intently at Sam waiting for the rest

SAM (CONTD)
I was in the hospital two weeks
Beth came in every night and sat
with me for a few hours She was my
only visitor I didnt feel like
talking Not to Beth not to
anyone So she didnt talk She sat
in the corner of the room
knitting Beths not a natural with
the knitting needles I mean shes
maybe the smartest human being Ive
ever met but this was not one of
her skills She never stopped
though Shed screw up all the
time shed have to unravel the
whole nights work but she never
stopped Do you know how good it
felt to have her in there Not
talking not giving me advice not
doing anything but being there with
me

Henry looks at Sams navy-blue cable-knit sweater

HENRY
The sweater you always wear
SAM

(nodding )
The morning the hospital released
me she came to give me a ride
home She looked exhausted I guess
she stayed up the whole night She
handed me the sweater and said Ta-
da Finished I tried it on and it
fit perfectly And she said-

HENRY
Its cold outside Sam

Sam stares at Henry

SAM
She told you the story

HENRY
Maybe I told her the story

SAM
What the hell does that mean

HENRY
Youre leaving something out
arent you You never told me why

SAM
Why I slit my wrists

Sam thinks about it for a moment and then shrugs
SAM (CONTD)
I thought everything was a lie The

whole world was a lie

HENRY
What if it is

Sam shrugs again

SAM
What if it is Its not worth dying
over

HENRY

Why not Why live if everything you
believe turns out to be a lie

SAM
Because its a beautiful lie
(beat)
And I want to see what comes next

Henry shakes his head

HENRY
No You dont

He starts to leave but Sam grabs him by the arm

SAM
I cant let you go Henry Im
taking you to the hospital

Sam begins leading Henry out the door

HENRY
Get your hands off me

SAM
I cant do that

Henry pulls a revolver from his waistband (the bulk of it had
been hidden below his T-shirt) He presses the muzzle against
Sams neck

HENRY
I think you can

SAM
Let me help you Henry Let me try

Henry says nothing but Sam sees the look in his eyes and
releases his arm

HENRY
You want to know what happened to
my parents I killed them I killed
my mother I killed my father
(beat)
Im going to Hell

SAM
I dont believe in Hell

HENRY
But I do Dr Foster I think were
already there

Henry walks out the buildings front door

Sam takes a deep breath He stares at his reflection in the
mirrored wall

After another moment he steels himself and walks out the
door
EXT MORNINGSIDE HEIGHTS -- CONTINUOUS

SAM
Henry--

But Henry is nowhere in sight Sam looks around trying to
spot him but hes gone

A taxi waits at a red light Sam runs over to it and climbs
into the backseat
INT TAXI -- CONTINUOUS

SAM

The CABBIE a middle-aged Filipino wearing a Mets cap turns
and raises his eyebrows at Sam

CABBIE

Sam hands the cabbie two twenties
SAM
Just keep the meter running
EXT CANAL STREET DINER -- AFTERNOON

Sam jumps out of the taxi and hurries into the diner

INT CANAL STREET DINER -- CONTINUOUS
Sam approaches WAITRESS 1

SAM
Is there an Athena working here

WAITRESS 1
Yeah Athena

Sam raises his eyebrows amazed that the search was so easy

A bull-necked BUTCH COOK wearing a dirty apron her grey hair
shaved to the scalp a buxom mermaid tattooed on her thick
forearm pushes open the kitchen door cleaver in her hand

BUTCH COOK
Yeah what

SAM
Athena

BUTCH COOK

BUTCH COOK

SAM

MONTAGE
Sam and the cabbie work their way east on Canal Street

stopping at every diner but finding no green-eyed Athena
Its getting darker and darker and time is running out

The wind picks up and rain starts to fall

EXT DINER -- NIGHT

Sam ends up at a rundown old diner on the corner of Canal and
Allen

The cabbie drives off This is the last diner

INT DINER

Sam seats himself at the counter Outside its pouring

SAM
Is there a waitress here named
Athena

WAITRESS 2

Athena Nah never heard of her

SAM
All right Could I just get a cup
of coffee please

Sam reaches into his blazer pocket for his wallet and feels
something else

He pulls out the engagement ring and turns it in the light
watching the diamond sparkle

WAITRESS 3 (0S)
You planning on proposing to
Athena

Sam looks up Waitress 3 apparently overheard his previous
conversation He pockets the ring

SAM
No Im-- do you know her Were

Green eyes

WAITRESS 3

SAM
No no nothing like that More

SAM

WAITRESS 3

He pulls out his wallet removes a photo ID and shows it
to her

SAM (CONTD)

WAITRESS 3
(examining ID)
Youre a psychiatrist huh So you

SAM
I could give them to a patient of
mine who needed them yes

WAITRESS 3
Okay Good luck finding Athena

She walks away Sam stares at her back and then up at the
clock on the wall which reads 730 Sam looks at Waitress 3
and takes a deep breath

INT ACTORS STUDIO -- NIGHT

A cramped stage in front of several rows of seats ATHENA
(the green-eyed woman from the DRIVERS POV sequences and the
LIFE MONTAGE) and DEVON a young man with bleached hair
stand on stage rehearsing

Sam enters through a door in back

ATHENA
What have you my good friends
deserved at the hands of Fortune
that she sends you to prison
hither

DEVON
Prison my lord

Sam sits in the back row and watches His hair is wet from
the rain

ATHENA
Denmarks a prison

DEVON
Then is the world one

ATHENA
A goodly one in which there are
many confines wards and dungeons
Denmark being one othworst

DEVON
We think not so my lord

ATHENA
Why then tis none to you For
there is nothing either good or bad
but thinking makes it so To me it
is a prison

DEVON
Prison my lord

Athena grins and shakes her head
ATHENA

Denmarks a prison We already had
this conversation

DEVON

Oh crap Um
ATHENA

(prompting)

Why then your ambition--

DEVON
Why then your ambition makes it
one Tis too narrow for your mind

ATHENA
O God I could be bounded in a
nutshell and count myself a king of
infinite space were it not that I
have bad dreams

(normal speaking voice)

Thats my favorite line in the
whole play

DEVON
Good line I better get home and
rest the pipes Ive got a solo in
choir tomorrow morning

ATHENA
Thanks for reading with me Youre
a good Rosencrantz

DEVON
Youre a good Hamlet

Devon grabs his satchel from the side of the stage and walks
out Sam stands and walks down to the stage where Athena is
packing up her things

SAM
I always pictured Hamlet as a man

ATHENA
Thats a bit narrow-minded of you
isnt it This is the lesbian
Hamlet All the parts are played by
women
SAM
Oh Thats new

ATHENA
Im joking Im Ophelia I just get
so sick of playing her Lovely
lost Ophelia Things get tough and
she jumps in the drink Hamlet hogs
all the good lines

SAM
Yeah hes notorious for that

ATHENA
Weve met before havent we

SAM
I dont think so

He offers his hand and they shake

SAM (CONTD)
Sam Foster

ATHENA
Athena Are you joining the class
Its good Kennys a bit of a
dictator but you get used to him

Athena pulls on her sweater

SAM
No Ive been looking for you
actually

ATHENA

Thats flattering Please tell me
youre a casting director

SAM
A psychiatrist unfortunately I
I have a patient who likes you very
much

Athena smiles but clearly shes not thrilled by this
conversation

ATHENA
This is an unusual way of getting a
date Whats his name

SAM
Henry Letham

ATHENA
(shaking her head)
Never heard of him

SAM
I was hoping you might know where
to find him He mentioned you once
He has a crush on you You served
him coffee in a diner you were
nice to him The way he tells it
you were the one good thing that
ever happened to him

ATHENA
Henry Is he very pale Very thin
and very pale His arms are
scarred

SAM
You remember him

ATHENA
He always ate pecan pie with his
coffee I remember that But we
never spoke outside the diner
Except

SAM
What Tell me

ATHENA
I feel stupid saying this stuff to
a psychiatrist Youll think Im
insane But I had the strangest
feeling about him I mean hes
this ragged-looking guy probably
hasnt bathed in months but
something about him Id seen him
before somewhere Id known him
Whats wrong with him

Sam hesitates for a moment This is privileged information
after all which he is loathe to disclose But theres no
time left for playing by the rules

SAM
Hes going to kill himself at
midnight

Athena opens her mouth to speak closes it then opens it
again

ATHENA
Why

SAM
He seems to believe he did
something terrible And he thinks
this is the only way he can make up
for it Thats my guess anyway

ATHENA
I wish there was something I could
do Actually this probably wont
help but I did run into him one
night at A Smiths

SAM
A Smiths

ATHENA
The art bookstore He was sitting
in the back reading I dont know
maybe he hangs out there Its
nearby Come on Ill show you

She leads Sam out the side door

EXT BACK ALLEY -- CONTINUOUS

A very dark narrow alley piled with trash Somewhere nearby
a BABY is howling

The storm has died down but a drizzle continues and
rainwater drips from the overhanging fire escapes

ATHENA
I know its gross

Sam steps in a puddle and looks down

SAM
Christ

He steps out of the puddle and looks up Athena is nowhere in
sight

SAM (CONTD)
Athena

The alley seems to be darker and narrower than before the
streetlights shining from the head of the alley seem farther
away

SAM (CONTD)
Athena

He begins jogging forward After a few steps he slips on a
wet wrapper and falls backwards onto the trash-strewn
pavement banging his head

For a moment everything is dark
SAMS SECOND DREAM

Sams face suddenly fills the screen He is staring directly
into the camera

SAM
Come on kid you need to stay
conscious Come on come on stay
with me

END OF SAMS SECOND DREAM

Sam opens his eyes Hes lying on his back in the alleyway
He stands unsteadily and brushes the dirt from his clothes
He pats his blazer pocket and realizes its empty

Panicked he looks through all his pockets The RING is gone

He bends down and tries to find the ring but there is no
light to see anything

He looks up The only light comes from beneath the side door
into the actors studio

Sam opens the door and lets the light from the studio shine
into the alleyway

ATHENA (0S)
Why then tis none to you

INT ACTORS STUDIO -- CONTINUOUS

Sam frowns and leans into the studio He cannot believe what
he sees

On stage Athena and Devon are performing the same duologue
as last time

ATHENA
For there is nothing either good or
bad but thinking makes it so To me
it is a prison

DEVON
Prison my lord

Athena grins and shakes her head
ATHENA
Denmarks a prison We already had

this conversation

Sam legs go weak He shakes his head back and forth

DEVON
Oh crap Um
SAM
(under his breath)
No
ATHENA
(prompting)

Why then your ambition--

DEVON
Why then your ambition makes it
one Tis too narrow for your mind

ATHENA
O God I could be bounded in a
nutshell and count myself a king of
infinite space were it not that I
have bad dreams

Sam bolts letting the side door close behind him Neither
Athena nor Devon seem to notice

ATHENA (CONTD)
Thats my favorite line in the
whole play
INT CAR - NIGHT

DRIVERS POV

Were cruising across the Brooklyn Bridge The drivers hands
(a mans hands) are on the steering wheel

We turn to the right and see Athena sleeping in the passenger
seat The drivers eyes (and the CAMERA) return to the road

Suddenly and with no warning everything changes

The car shakes and lurches to the right We see the hands on
the wheel desperately trying to control the car but its
impossible

Through the windshield we see the road spinning away from us
and then the steel guardrail coming at us far too fast

INT LEONS APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Leon sits by a partially-opened window listening to the
wind the rain the thunder He sways as he listens and
gestures with his hands as if he were conducting the storm

HENRY (0S)
You always loved storms

Leon grabs his cane and stands up

LEON
Whos that How did you get in
here

Leon trembles and thrusts at the air in front of him with his
cane

HENRY
Its me Dad Henry

LEON
What are you doing here

HENRY
What are you doing here You died
I kissed your cheek at the wake

LEON
Youve got the wrong man I told
you that before I never had any
children

HENRY
You dont recognize me

He walks over to Leon who hears him coming and raises his
cane in fear Henry grabs the cane and pulls the older man
closer

HENRY (CONTD)
Im not going to hurt you

He removes Leons dark glasses Leons eyes swim in their
sockets useless blind eyes

HENRY (CONTD)
Look at me Dad Look at me

CLOSE on Leons eyes They seem to stabilize the pupils
dilating beginning to focus to work

Leon looks directly at Henry now He reaches out and touches
the young mans face

Leon cannot speak He looks at his own hands the lines
creasing his palms He looks out the window A bolt of
lightning brightens the night sky and Leon moans

LEON
Lightning

HENRY
Do you recognize me now

Leon turns back to the boy Leons face is transfixed with
wonder everything he sees is a miracle He touches Henrys
cheek again

LEON
What are you

HENRY
Im your son

LEON
No--

Henry embraces the older man buries his face in the
psychiatrists shoulder

HENRY
Is this my punishment Dad You
wont recognize me

LEON
I never had a--

HENRY
Please please Dad Forgive me

LEON
For what

HENRY
For killing you

Leon pushes out of the embrace and takes a half step
backward
LEON
Im alive

Henry shakes his head sadly

LEON (CONTD)
What are you Are you a god

HENRY
A god

LEON
You perform miracles

HENRY
Miracles

He walks over to the living room wall One

strip of wallpaper

has begun to peel slightly and Henry tears the strip off the

wall

HENRY (CONTD)
You think its a miracle

Words in black ink are scribbled on the bare wall beneath the

paper

HENRY (CONTD)
Can you see now

Henry tears off an entire sheet of the wallpaper and then
another and then another flaying the wall

The phrase FORGIVE ME is written again and

again the

familiar endless loop of minuscule tortured handwriting

HENRY (CONTD)

Can you see Its in my head Dad

Its all in my head

Leon stares at the writing for several seconds then turns to

stare at Henry

LEON
No--

HENRY
Im dreaming you

Leon opens his mouth to speak but no words

come out

HENRY (CONTD)
I cant get out of it I try-- I
try to wake up but I cant Im
trapped here

LEON
Henry--

HENRY
But I cant die in a dream right
So if I try to kill myself I1l
end the dream

LEON
And what happens to us

Henry stares at the older man for a moment and then abruptly
turns and leaves Leon limps after him

LEON (CONTD)
What happens to us What happens
to us

Henry opens the apartment door and slams it shut behind him

Leon looks at the closed door for a moment and then out the
window where the lightning is becoming more and more
frequent

INT THE WHITE HORSE TAVERN -- NIGHT

A sprawling old bar in the West Village Henry soaking wet
from the rain pushes open the door and enters The barroom
is nearly empty He approaches the bar

The BARTENDER is a heavily-muscled bruiser paging through a
bodybuilding MAGAZINE

BARTENDER
You got ID

Henry takes his drivers license out of his wallet and the
bartender inspects it carefully The clock on the wall reads
905

BARTENDER (CONTD)
(smiling)
Happy birthday kid First ones on
the house

HENRY
A shot of Jack with a Bud back

BARTENDER
An All-American drinker thats
what I like to see Coming right

HENRY

his last drink

BARTENDER

(serving the shot and

beer)
Yep He lined up eighteen shots
downed them all and said There
I think thats a record Then he
dropped dead Do not go gentle
into that good night

Henry raises his shot glass to the bartender
HENRY
Rage rage against the dying of
the light
Henry gulps down the shot and pounds the glass onto the bar
HENRY (CONTD)
Eighteen more for the record

EXT EIGHTH AVENUE -- NIGHT

Sam shell shocked walks slowly down the block He looks
into the face of every person he passes

A light rain continues to fall

SAMS POV

Every shade of humanity is represented in the quickly passing
faces The beautiful and the ugly the rich and the poor the
thin and the fat the happy and the agitated and the

expressionless

Each face comes into focus for a second before leaving the
frame

Sam stops in front of a storefront A SMITHS is written in
gold script on the glass
INT A SMITHS -- NIGHT

Sam wanders through the aisles He checks the back area
where a few STUDENTS sit on the window ledges paging through

art books Henry is not here
A bespectacled CLERK approaches Sam

CLERK
Can I help you find something

SAM
Henry Letham

CLERK
A book by Henry Letham or on Henry
Letham

SAM
No hes I thought he might be
here I heard he comes here
sometimes

The clerk calls over to SMITTY the rumpled shop owner who
sits behind the checkout counter paging through a book of

photographs
CLERK
Smitty you know a guy named Henry
Letham
SMITTY
Sure

(he looks at Sam)
Something happen to him

SAM
I need to find him Its an
emergency

SMITTY

(laughing)
Look at me

SAM

SMITTY
Nah he hasnt been by in weeks
Youre his father

SAM
No I I teach up at Columbia

SMITTY
Youre his art teacher Kids got
talent I have one of his paintings
here somewhere

Smitty ducks below the counter and begins delving through the
drawers

SMITTY (CONTD)
(crouching)
Here we go

He stands and spreads an unframed CANVAS over the counter
INSERT PAINTING

Its a very dark haunting interpretation of the Brooklyn
Bridge at night The perspective is unusual looking straight
up the Gothic arches-- the view you would have if you were
lying flat on your back on the bridge

SMITTY (CONTD)
He didnt have any money for the
books he wanted so he gave me
this I think I got a pretty good
deal

SAM
What books did he get

SMITTY
Tristan Réveur What else The kid
is obsessed with Tristan Réveur
Maybe he got that from your class

SAM
I doubt it Do you have any more
Tristan Réveur books

SMITTY
Nah he bought me out It was all
secondhand out-of-print stuff So
what do you think Is he gonna make
it

SAM
What

Smitty indicates the painting

SMITTY
You think hes got what it takes

Sam stares at the painting and nods

INT WHITE HORSE TAVERN -- NIGHT

Henry is drunk A row of empty shot glasses is lined up
before him The clock reads 1003 The Bands I Shall be
Released plays over the stereo system

HENRY
Could you change the station They
never quit playing this song

The bartender raises his eyebrows

BARTENDER
First time I heard it in years

He changes the station

HENRY
Where is everybody

BARTENDER
I guess the rain scared people
away

HENRY
Its my birthday I want some
company

A crew of soaked TOURISTS stumble into the bar They speak
German HAUSER their leader a tall blonde man with mutton-
chop sideburns and a bead necklace approaches the bartender

HAUSER
Is this the place of death of Dylan
Thomas

BARTENDER
Yep

HAUSER

Ah

He turns to his friends and announces the news in German
They all say Ah and nod happily

INT WHITE HORSE TAVERN -- LATER

The Germans and Henry sit in a circle all of them very
drunk Hauser is reciting a Thomas poem He has a strong
accent but he gets every word right

HAUSER
And death shall have no dominion
Dead men naked they shall be one
With the man in the wind and the
west moon

Meanwhile Henry pulls the heavy black revolver from the
pocket of his overcoat and places it on the bar

The bartender reading his muscle magazine at the far end of
the bar does not notice Nor do the Germans

HAUSER (CONTD)
When their bones are picked clean
and the clean bones gone They
shall have stars at elbow and
foot

Henry reaches back into his pocket and dumps six bullets onto
the bar

HAUSER (CONTD)
Though they go mad they shall be
sane Though they sink through the
sea they shall rise again

Henry opens the guns cylinder loads one bullet spins the
cylinder

HAUSER (CONTD)
Though lovers be lost love shall
not And death shall have no
dominion

The other Germans clap and whistle

HENRY
You want to play a drinking game

The Germans nod and smile at him but its clear they have no
idea what hes talking about He aims the revolver at his own
head

The Germans are suddenly very quiet
He pulls the trigger

Click

He offers the gun to Hauser

HENRY (CONTD)
You sure you dont want to play

HAUSER
(refusing the gun)
No please This is for drinking
game

Henry reopens the cylinder adds another bullet spins
presses the barrel to his head

HENRY
You hear a click you drink You
hear a bang I drink
Henry winks at the German and pulls the trigger

Click

HENRY (CONTD)
Drink

Hauser smiles and nods at his comrades He grabs a full beer
mug from the bar and downs half of it in a gulp

The bartender looks up sees whats happening throws down
his magazine

BARTENDER
Whoa whoa whoa little brother
What are you doing

Henry doesnt answer He adds another bullet spins aims
pulls the trigger

Click
Hauser finishes the beer and places the empty mug on the bar

The other Germans less confident that this is really a game
have slowly begun to back away

BARTENDER (CONTD)
Put the gun down kid Come on

HAUSER
(to bartender )
This is a drinking game

BARTENDER

Hauser is nervous now He stares at his comrades who can
only watch fearfully

HENRY (CONTD)
Come on youre falling behind

Hauser grabs another beer and swills it down

Fifth bullet The same procedure The bartender is inching
closer to Henry Henry looks at him The bartender freezes

One of the German women starts crying Hauser drinks as much
as he can but spits some of it up

Henry inserts the sixth bullet into the sixth chamber He
closes the cylinder is about to spin it realizes he doesnt
have to smiles at the Germans presses the muzzle against
his temple

Henry lowers the pistol

The bartender and the Germans release their breath at the
same time

HAUSER
It is a joke It is a toy yes It

Henry points the revolver at the bottle of Jack Daniels
sitting on the bar He pulls the trigger The bottle
explodes

Nobody moves Henry returns the revolver to his pocket He
bows to the Germans

HENRY
Welcome to America

He walks out of the silent bar

LILA

Sam waits on the line Someone taps on the side of the phone
booth behind Sam Sam waves the person away but theres
another tap Impatiently Sam turns around

Leon stands there smiling in the rain no longer wearing
dark glasses looking directly into Sams eyes

Sam stares at Leon for a moment before speaking

SAM
Leon

LEON

eyes

SAM

You can see me

LEON
I can see everything For the first
time I can see everything

Sam cannot speak for a moment Finally

SAM

Sam shakes his head in stunned disbelief

SAM
Whats happening to us

LEON
The Buddhists had it right the
whole time The world is illusion

SAM

LEON
No Henrys dreaming

INT CAR -- NIGHT
DRIVERS POV

We watch a terrible accident from the drivers perspective
through the windshield the steel guardrails rush toward us
and its too late to swerve

The collision is utterly eerily silent

The CAMERAS motion follows the head of the driver slamming
forward and then back a terrible confusion as the car begins
to roll the windshield shattered

In all this chaos we are thrown from the car but its
impossible to get any sense of our bearings before the SCREEN
GOES BLACK

EXT SEVENTH AVENUE -- NIGHT

Henry soaked by the rain stands outside a clothes boutique
well lit to attract passers-by He stares through the plate
glass window at the immaculately-attired mannequins

A sign posted inside the window reads EVERYTHING MUST GO

BOY (0S)
Mommy is that man going to die

Henry startled turns and sees the same boy and mother weve
encountered several times before The mother pulls her son
closer They stare at Henry

The boy holds a red balloon

Henry looks down Blood is dripping from his shirtsleeves
down his arms off his fingertips splattering on the
sidewalk mixing with the rainwater He stares at his palms
Somewhere nearby a BABY is howling

When Henry looks up again everything on the crowded street

has stopped The cars and trucks and buses have stopped the
people on the sidewalk have stopped

Everyone stares at Henry Riders on the city bus lean out the
window and stare at him Bicycle messengers stare at him A
woman walking her dog stares at him and so does the dog The
newspaper vendor stares at him People sitting ina
restaurant look at him through the window

Henry closes his eyes The puddle of blood by his feet grows
larger and larger

INT COLUMBIA LIBRARY STACKS

INSERT LEATHER BOOK SPINE

The gold-lettered title reads La Vie de Tristan Réveur
Lila pulls the book off the shelf and begins skimming through
the final pages Her cell phone is wedged between her

shoulder and her face

LILA

LILA
Yeah My French is a little rusty

She reads haltingly translating as she goes

LILA (CONT D)

Leon presses a button on a black faceless watch he wears A

synthesized voice speaks

VOICE

Leon spreads his open hands to indicate the street the

LEON (CONTD)
All gone

Sam pulls out his wallet fishes a card from it and hands it
to Leon

SAM
Call the police and tell them
Henrys on the Brooklyn Bridge with
a gun Then call Jeff Schlegel at
the Mobile Crisis Unit

Sam runs to the curb and tries to hail a taxi All of them
are occupied

LEON
Saturday night in the rain Youll
never find a cab

SAM
Jesus

Sam sees the subway station on the corner (were on Eighth
Avenue and Fourteenth Street) He starts running toward it

Leon watches him go and then drops Schlegels card It
flutters to the sidewalk

Leon walks away west on Fourteenth Street He is the only
person on the sidewalk As he walks farther from the camera
we see for the first time that his feet are bare

In the middle of the block the streetlight above him
flickers and dies The succeeding streetlights lined up
parallel on opposite sides of the avenue progressively
flicker and die

Leon disappears into the darkness

INT SUBWAY CAR -- NIGHT

Sams riding on the 6 (he took the L to the 6)

Hes alone in the car except for a MUSLIM WOMAN in full
veil Sam looks at her Is she the same woman he saw in his
building earlier in the day

She resolutely keeps her gaze on the floor

The express train passes by on the inside track

Sam watches it pass Each fluorescent-lighted car is empty
Except the last car

Henry stands in the last car holding onto a pole

His eyes meet Sams

Henry waves goodbye as his train plunges into the tunnel
ahead

EXT BROOKLYN BRIDGE SUBWAY STATION -- NIGHT

Sam runs up the stairs of the station and begins sprinting
east The streets are slick with rain

EXT SOUTH STREET -- NIGHT

Sam runs

EXT EAST RIVER -- NIGHT

The lights from the Brooklyn Bridges suspension cables are
reflected in the dark waters of the East River

A white rose floats beneath the bridge pelted by the falling
rain

EXT BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- NIGHT

Sam finally reaches the great bridge He runs up the walkway
Henry stands alone on the walkway beneath one of the two
stone arches that rise above the bridge The Manhattan-bound

traffic rumbles by behind him He ignores the rain

Henry stares at the giant clockface atop a building in
Brooklyn The clock reads 1157

SAM
Henry

Henry turns and sees Sam running toward him We now see that
Henry holds the revolver in his right hand

The headlights of passing cars flicker over both mens faces

Henry smiles

HENRY
Dr Foster Im glad you came to
watch

SAM

(gasping for air)
I didnt come to watch I came to
stop you

Henry cocks the hammer of his revolver

SAM (CONTD)

(speaking rapidly)
I found your waitress tonight I
found Athena She remembers you

The mention of her name seems to make Henry distraught He
shakes his head violently

HENRY
I didnt mean to hurt her

SAM
You havent hurt anyone yet Henry
Just put the gun down

HENRY
Ive hurt people I have Ive done
something terrible

SAM
Just put the gun down Henry Okay
Put the gun down Let me help you

HENRY
Its the only way out Dont you
see that

SAM
One of the first times I met you
you said you didnt know what was
real anymore Okay well I thought
I did but I was wrong I dont know
whats real either And if you die-

HENRY

Youre real Dr Foster You tried
to save me You were just a little
too late

(beat)
For the longest time I didnt
understand what was happening to
me But now--

SAM
But you waited Why didnt you
shoot yourself as soon as you knew
You wanted me to help you Why

HENRY
Because Im afraid I dont know
whats on the other side
(beat)
Maybe thats why I cant wake up
Im afraid to go back there

SAM
Then dont Dont go back
HENRY
Its a dream Its got to end
sometime
SAM

Listen Listen to me If youre
wrong you pull the trigger and
youre dead End of story

HENRY
Im not wrong

Sam nods but says nothing for a moment

SAM
(very quiet)
Okay What if youre right What if
it is your dream Look around Look
around

Henry takes his eyes off Sam and looks around The cars race
by headlights streaming Below the bridge the East River
flows And behind them are the towers of Manhattan

Everything shimmers in the rainfall The skyline looks both
majestic and fragile

SAM (CONTD)
The whole world is in your dream
Athenas here Im here everyone
You kill yourself youre killing
all of us
(beat)
Stay here Stay with us

HENRY
I have to wake up

The moment he says these words everything goes quiet The
bridge is suddenly empty no traffic at all nobody in sight
but Henry and Sam

The rain stops The stars normally invisible above the city
now crowd the sky brighter and more numerous than weve ever
seen them

Then the stars begin to fall all the stars rain from the
sky leaving burning trails in their wake the entire sky
crisscrossed with these scars

An apocalyptic howl the most terrifying noise imaginable
seems to erupt from everywhere and nowhere The bridge
shudders and sways

Henry shoves the barrel of the revolver into his mouth

SAM
Please dont Please--

CLOSE on Henry
He pulls the trigger
FADE TO WHITE

Very bright People in the theater should be shielding their
eyes

As we fade in we see that the bright light is actually a
small flashlight shining directly into the camera

SAM (0S) (CONTD)
Hes still alive

The camera pulls back to show Henry lying on his back on the
walkway blood streaming from his head Sam is crouched
beside him holding one of his wrists In his other hand Sam
holds a small flashlight which he shines in Henrys eyes

Sam is not wearing his navy-blue cable-knit sweater though
he was before Henry shot himself

The camera pulls back farther This is the Brooklyn Bridge
but this is not the scene we just left A Ford Mustang has
just been in a terrible collision

There is a gaping hole in the windshield on the drivers
side Flames consume the backseat Smoke spills out the
windows The radio still plays however The Bands I Shall
be Released

One of the Mustangs front tires has blown out Scraps of
black rubber litter the accident scene

ATHENA is kneeling next to Henry on the opposite side of
Sam holding Henrys other hand

Henrys arms are burned and lacerated from the accident

Other cars have stopped short of the Mustang All Manhattan-
bound traffic has come to a halt From the distance we hear
the blaring of horns

ATHENA
(in shock)
Hes okay right Hes going to be
okay

Sam leans closer to the injured man so that his face is
hovering right above Henrys

Henrys eyes are open He appears able to see but hes
losing a tremendous amount of blood It puddles below him on
the asphalt deep red in the bridges incandescent lights

SAM
(to the gathering crowd)
We need an ambulance Somebody call
an ambulance

He begins to unbutton his shirt BETH LEVY gets out of a
stopped car and hurries over She wears the navy-blue cable-
knit SWEATER which she now quickly shrugs out of and hands
to Sam

BETH
Here use this

Sam bundles the sweater and presses it against the deep
unseen gash on Henrys head

BETH (CONTD)
I just called 911 Theyre on the
way
HENRY
(to Athena)
Hold this--

He has Athena hold the sweater to staunch the bleeding

ATHENA
(to Henry)
Stop bleeding baby Okay Youve
got to stop bleeding now

Sam pinches Henrys nostrils and blows into his mouth to make
sure the airways are clear

SAM
Hes breathing Hold that tight

Sam goes to check on the other two casualties The first an
old man lies halfway out of one of the rear windows Sam
checks his pulse Nothing

Sam shakes his head and walks around to the other side of the
car but we PULL IN for a closer look at the old man

Its LEON Blood leaks from his nostrils and mouth

On the other side of the car lies MRS LETHAM face up eyes
open Blood streams down her face from a massive head wound
Sam checks her pulse as well but its obvious shes dead

Sam closes her eyelids hurries back to Henry and crouches
beside him

ATHENA
His mom and dad Are they okay

SAM
Theyre both gone

CLOSE ON HENRYS EYES We can tell that he has registered
this news

For a moment the frames projected on screen slow from their
24-per-second clip and then melt away entirely The white
screen is replaced by a shot weve seen before Henry alone
on the empty bridge walking from the burning Mustang

The vision disappears as quickly as it appeared and were
back at the accident scene watching Sam trying desperately
to save Henry

In the backseat of one of the stopped cars a BABY strapped
into its baby seat HOWLS and howls

A crowd has gathered around the accident scene From the
nearest cars come the drivers and their passengers circling
around Henry

The strange thing is that we recognize all of them

The Englishman and his wife Sheriff Kennelly (not in
uniform) A young woman we last saw on the subway asking
Henry about his Spanish Art class and the businessman who
wanted him to quit smoking Dr Schlegel and the burly
paramedics (not in uniform) A middle-aged Filipino wearing a
Mets cap The various waitresses and cooks we saw in the
diners Devon Smitty The Muslim woman in full veil The
bartender from the White Horse Tavern A crew of blonde
tourists standing together The piano movers

The boy with the red balloon and his mother

BOY
Mommy is that man going to die

Lila rushes over to Sam Athena and Henry

LILA
Im a nurse

SAM
All right keep tabs on his pulse
If it stops well have to start
CPR

Lila grabs Henrys wrist and checks his pulse against her
watch

SAM (CONTD)
(to Athena)
Whats his name

ATHENA
Henry

SAM
Can you hear me Henry Henry Im
a doctor Im going to help you
Can you hear me

Henrys lips have begun to pale from the loss of blood When
he speaks his mouth barely moving Sam and Athena bend
closer to hear

HENRY
Hail

Athena looks up No hail is falling but the lights on the
suspension cables above look like pieces of ice suspended in
the air

ATHENA
Its not hail baby

LILA
Hes hallucinating

SAM
Keep him talking

Henrys eyes are still open but he appear to be fading fast
He is trying to speak and his face contorts with the effort
Athena bends closer to hear him

SAM (CONTD)
What did he say

The blood from Henrys head wound has seeped through the
sweater and onto Athenas hand

Athena struggles to keep from hysteria She kisses Henry on
the forehead When she looks up we see that her mouth and
chin are spotted with Henrys blood

ATHENA
Forgive me

SAM
It wasnt your fault Henry I was
driving right behind you Your
front tire blew out

ATHENA
You hear that baby It wasnt
anybodys fault

CLOSE ON HENRYS EYES Again it appears that he understands
the message The words have a calming effect his face is no
longer contorted

SAM
We need an ambulance

Sam stands up and looks out over the backed-up traffic We
PULL BACK and see that the bridge is jammed with rush-hour
commuters There is no ambulance coming

Sam crouches down again and peers into Henrys eyes He takes
hold of Henrys free hand (Athena holds the other hand)

SAM (CONTD)
Come on kid you need to stay
conscious Come on come on wake
up

Henry mutters something Sam leans closer to hear

HENRY
Youre real Dr Foster

Sam has no idea what Henrys talking about

SAM
Its Dr Williams Henry Just stay
with me

ATHENA

Henry come on Come on I need
you baby come on

LILA
Im losing the pulse Doctor

Sam begins CPR

ATHENA
Stay Henry stay Stay Stay
Stay

CLOSE ON HENRYS FACE
The camera shows what Henry sees

HENRYS POV of the crowd of faces gathered around him At
first they are clear each face cleanly delineated But they
begin to blur and merge together

The camera PANS UP past the blur of faces We see the great
Gothic arches of the bridge from this angle-- the perspective
of a man lying flat on his back

We have seen this view before in Henrys painting

The camera continues to PAN UP past the glittering towers of
Manhattan up and up into the nighttime sky

Now the screen is BLACK but we continue to hear Athenas
words

ATHENA (0S) (CONTD)
Stay Stay

The screen is black for ten seconds And we think its going
to stay black except now we notices pin-pricks of light
piercing the darkness

The stars are back in the sky but these are the usual pale
New York stars not the hallucinatory fires that scarred the
air with their fall

PAN DOWN to the bridge

Two ambulances have arrived as well as several police cars
The PARAMEDICS (not the same ones weve seen before) load
three dead bodies onto stretchers while the POLICE OFFICERS

mark the scene and begin questioning people in the crowd

A female OFFICER sits with a stunned Athena on the trunk of a
squad car

Meanwhile a TOW TRUCK OPERATOR begins attaching the hooks
and chains to the ruined Mustang One lane of westbound
traffic has already resumed moving

The people in the passing cars stare out their windows at the
carnage

Sam and Lila grim-faced and exhausted from their ordeal
stand beside one of the ambulances

SAM
Too much bleeding Too much

LILA
You did everything you could
Doctor There was never a chance

Sam says nothing Lila touches him on the shoulder briefly
and walks away

Shes getting farther and farther away Soon shell be gone
Sam finally looks up

SAM
Hey

Lila turns

SAM (CONTD)
Thanks for helping

Lila smiles sadly

LILA
I wish we could have done more

She starts to walk away again
SAM

You want to grab a cup of coffee
somewhere

Lila turns again and looks at him

SAM (CONTD)
I wont be able to sleep tonight

Lila hesitates for a second and then nods

LILA
Id like that

Sam begins walking toward her and then stops

He notices something lying on the asphalt something
glittering amid the debris of the wreck the broken glass and
twisted metal He kneels and picks it up

Lila curious as to what hes found walks over to him

LILA (CONTD)
What is it

Sam standing shows her the diamond ring It glitters in the
lights of the bridge But were pulling back now farther and
farther from the wrecked car the ambulances the slow-moving
traffic

Were rising higher and higher above the suspension cables
above the great arches above the blinking red lights that
warn airplane pilots

All the commotion on the bridge is silent now nothing but
beads of light trickling over the dark river
