UNDER THIS this we hear a conversation

HARDY (VO)
--- SO Madelyn turned up

LAUREL (VO)
Madelyn turned up

HARDY (VO)
Completely out of the blue Haven’t
seen her in fifteen years

INT DRESSING ROOMROACH LOTSTUDIO - DAY 1

Oliver HARDY leans against the door to a dressing room
worried expression talking to his friend Stan LAUREL Both
are in their late-40s (at the peak of their movie careers)
but to begin with we have no real clue as to who they are
where they are or what they do They are just two guys in
cheap suits talking to each other HARDY lights up a
cigarette as he talks

HARDY
There she was all gussied up on
the front door step And that’s
something I never thought I’d see
again

LAUREL picks up a boot (the right one) with a large hole in
the sole Using a knife he levers off the heel

LAUREL
What’d she want

HARDY
Twenty thousand bucks

LAUREL
Twenty thousand

HARDY
Fifteen years of back alimony I
said ‘what alimony When we broke
up I gave you whatever money I had
and you took the car’ We both
agreed that was that

LAUREL
Jeez even Mae wasn’t after that
much - and she wanted me to pay for
a chauffeur It’s because our faces
are plastered all over town
Probably some lawyer’s bright idea

LAUREL levers off the other heel

HARDY
Well in any case I haven’t got it
Myrtle cleaned me out when we

split

As he pulls the boots on LAUREL considers this but doesn’t
reply HARDY picks up his Bowler hat then LAUREL picks up
his and they leave the dressing room (without putting them
on) In a CONTINUOUS SHOT we follow them out to

A studio corridor
Stan and Ollie - Goldenrod Revisions 200417 2

As they continue on their journey LAUREL finishes fastening a
frayed cuff with a paper clip for a cuff-link

LAUREL
You been down to Tijuana

HARDY
What makes you say that

LAUREL
We had a few days off

HARDY
I did have a little run down there
with Mysterious Montague yes
trying to win some back Not
entirely successfully Which
reminds me Would you do me favour
don’t talk money with Hal today

LAUREL
Charlie Buster Harold - they get
ten times what he pays us

They pass through a door and emerge into the bright

California sunshine now making their way along an alleyway

between buildings on the Roach lot

Caption
Culver City California 1937
HARDY
Well they own their own pictures
LAUREL
Exactly And that’s what we’re

gonna do

As they pass a couple of SCENE HANDS moving parts of

a Roman

set along on a trolley - starting to give us a sense of the

business they are in

SCENE HAND
Hey boys how’s it goin’

The first SCENE HAND moves his hair up into a mad quiff -
Laurel-style The second fiddles with his tie just like

Hardy LAUREL and HARDY smile and wave back politely

HARDY
We’re just going shark fishing -
Mr Laurel doesn’t know it yet but
he’s the bait

LAUREL screws his face up into the start of a ‘cry’ the
SCENE HANDS laugh and they continue on their way As the BOYS
turn a corner we see in the background the ranch-fronted
main building to Hal Roach’s Culver City studios pure old
Hollywood Still the conversation continues

HARDY
How we gonna do that We’re under
contract we can’t just change the
terms

LAUREL
We stick together renegotiate with
Hal and get a slice of the pie Or
we walk and we set up on our own

HARDY
Oh I don’t know Stan I’d love to
own our pictures but it’s just not
a good time for this I have a lot
going on my overhead is killing
me

LAUREL

HARDY

LAUREL

Laurel hugs Hardy

LAUREL

Men in Roman costumes walk past Laurel and Hardy

HARDY
What are all these Romans doing
here

LAUREL
Maybe there’s a sale on at the
Forum

HARDY

Always working

The boys enter Studio Two where a busy set is being prepared
for their latest movie a western The hum of activity the
lights the camera a huge back projection screen erected -
all add to the mounting sense of anticipation Just for a
moment they are backlit against the studio lights two
familiar silhouettes - the thin guy and the fat guy - as they
make their way onto set

As they walk on set HARDY sees LUCILLE late 20s the script
supervisor sitting by the camera clipboard on her knees
Director James HORNE 50s calls over to her

HORNE
Lucille you got my sides over
there

She holds up the director’s well-thumbed script and he

wanders over to her HARDY catches her eye and gives her a
secret smile then kisses the tips of his fingers and blows
them to her She smiles back shyly HARDY turns to LAUREL

HARDY
Hey Stan Why don’t we hold off on
leaving right now and just push him
for a raise

Actor James FINLAYSON 50 bald head big whiskery moustache
walks past them on his way out of the studio having overheard
the end of their conversation HARDY greets him

HARDY (contd)
Hey Jimmie

FINLAYSON
Give you a raise He’d rather lower
Hollywood And that’s a Scotsman
talking

With familiar grumpy face and big eye he bustles off

FINLAYSON (contd)
Ah’m goin’ for a smoke

LAUREL sees studio boss Hal ROACH 40s a bullish native of
New Jersey heading straight for them with a red angry face

ROACH
(To LAUREL)
That’s it Stan we’re through

LAUREL
Good morning Hal

ROACH
I’m pullin’ a morals clause on ya

A couple of MAKE-UP GIRLS - trying desperately to concentrate
on their job - start to touch up LAUREL and HARDY One pulls
HARDY’S hair which was parted at the side down into a
fringe The other applies pancake-white make up to LAUREL In
CLOSE UP we see some bruising and discoloration around
LAUREL’S upper lip which is swiftly covered up

Kk

Stan and Ollie - Goldenrod Revisions 200417

ROACH (contd)
(To HARDY)
Another fight at his place last
night one of the neighbours sees
Ruthie sock him in the mouth so
they call the cops

LAUREL turns to HARDY embarrassed

LAUREL
She found out bout Vera

ROACH
Cost me five hundred bucks to keep
it out the papers - and that’s
comin’ out of your paycheck You
signed a contract ‘Second party
agrees not to shock insult or
offend the community or prejudice
Hal Roach studios’

LAUREL
That’s the last thing I’d want to
do not when you have so much
prejudice already How’s your old
buddy Mussolini the one you were
gonna go into business with before
he started bombing all those poor
people in Africa

See ROACH fuming Laurel’s MAKE-UP GIRL now arranges his (un-
styled) hair into a spiky quiff Hardy’s starts to apply the

pancake white make-up to him

ROACH
All he wants to do is fight How
many times you been married Stan

LAUREL
My personal life is my own business
- that’s one thing you don’t hold
the rights to

HARDY
Why can’t we all be friends here
ROACH
Friends When were me and him ever
friends
LAUREL

Finally something we agree on

LAUREL and HARDY stand on marks in the middle of the set
exterior of a saloon with a patch of ground prepared in front
of them and that huge back projection screen behind

See HARDY thinking about protesting this but actually

ROACH
What is it you’re still lookin’
for

LAUREL
(Needled)
I’m looking for a fair price for a
Laurel and Hardy picture and you
know it

ROACH
Money His favourite subject

LAUREL
Oh right you don’t like money Hal
You’re in it for the laughs That’s
why our pictures sell all over the
world and we haven’t got a dime

knows it’s true

He nods

ROACH
Because you keep gettin’ divorced

LAUREL
No Because you’re a cheapskate who
got rich off our backs

HARDY
Stan please-

LAUREL
A cheapskate a skinflint and a
a parvenu

HARDY - clearly don’t know what a ‘parvenu’ is

HARDY
A parvenu

LAUREL
(To HARDY)
My contract’s up and he thinks
because you’ve still got another
ten months on yours I can’t go
anywhere and I’1ll have to take what
he’s offering

ROACH
(suspicious)
Wait What’s a Parvenu

satisfied that he’s landed a blow But ROACH - and

nowhere and made a load of money
but has no class Look it up in the
dictionary Hal there’s a picture
of you

ROACH
You’re such a smart ass Well guess
what I’m smarter

LAUREL
(Back to ROACH referring
to HARDY)
Has he told you yet We’re setting
up on our own

Hardy looks surprised

Final touches - Laurel’s MAKE-UP GIRL gives him dark eye
liner Hardy’s blackens his moustache
HARDY
Hal it might be better if you
could see your way to a modest e

raise
But ROACH ignores him and addresses his response to LAUREL

ROACH
What happens to Babe when you go
off and make movies for somebody
else Like you said he’s still
under contract to me And I ain’t
releasin’ him

A WRANGLER hands the reins of a mule to HARDY

LAUREL
You can’t have Hardy without
Laurel

ROACH

We’ll see about that
Director HORNE is ready to shoot He tries to interject

HORNE
Hal could you maybe continue this
some other time Unless you wanna
pay for an extra day

ROACH is aware all eyes are on him

ROACH
Go ahead - shoot
(HORNE looks at him)
Go ahead

HORNE
(Turning to LAUREL)
Okay we’re on a wide two-shot here
Stan like you wanted and then-

ROACH
What are you checking with him for -
youre the director

The CREW COWBOY EXTRAS and a four piece harmony group the
‘AVALON BOYS’ dressed in cowboy outfits and arranged in
readiness on a verandah outside the saloon watch in stunned
silence HARDY gives LUCILLE a small helpless shrug
Stan and Ollie - Goldenrod Revisions 200417 8

ROACH
(As he storms off)
Next person you’1ll hear from is my
lawyer

ROACH storms out the studio

HARDY
Well that went well

LAUREL
So who else is going to be on the
boat

HARDY

Clark Gable I think

LAUREL
No women

HARDY
Carole Lombard I think she’s
friends with Myrnaloy

LAUREL
Ok I’m gonna come
HORNE
Okay show’s over Let’s roll

camera
This has no impact everybody just looks at him dumbstruck

HORNE (contd)
I said roll camera

As the crew now prepares for a shot HARDY looks at LAUREL
They have to be funny now

HORNE (contd)
Ready boys

A beat then the boys exchange a nod and pull on their
Bowlers They are ready HORNE sees this and knows they are
ready for a take He touches the arm of the CLAPPERLOADER
who marks the take

HORNE

Back projection

LAUREL
Remember After the curtseys knee
down turn and shake

HARDY
Got it

The screen behind the boys flickers into life wondrously
creating the illusion of a bustling western main street

HORNE
Okay aaaand action

Now the set comes to life too with COWBOYS crossing the
street to and fro and the AVALON BOYS strike up a song -
‘At The Ball That’s All’

AVALON BOYS
Commence advancin commence
advancin
Just start a prancin right and
left a-glancin
A moochee dancin slide and glide
entrancin
You do the tango jiggle
With a Texas Tommy wiggle

And so with all the elements now in place all that remains
is for Stan and Ollie - those two guys complaining about ex-
wives and paychecks - to now become the movie stars ‘Laurel and
Hardy’ the best loved comedy duo in the world The
transition is apparently effortless to begin with smiles on
their faces LAUREL and HARDY (in character) take a few steps
into shot having just arrived in town HARDY tethers the
mule to a post and turns to enjoy watching the boys singing

AVALON BOYS (contd)
Take your partner
And you hold her
Tightly enfold her
A little bolder
Just work your shoulder
Snap your fingers one and all
In the hall at the ball
Thats all - some ball

They start to nod their heads and tap their toes letting the
music take them Director HORNE watches tense excited The
‘AVALON BOYS’ repeat the first verse adding deep harmonies
and yodels and LAUREL and HARDY now start to perform an
apparently impromptu dance routine in time with the song
Building slowly it is all light steps twirls and
synchronized movement The watching CREW get caught up in it
LUCILLE seems entranced Even FINLAYSON has come back to
watch leaning against a wall moustache twinkling LAUREL
and HARDY come together and hold each other like ballroom
dancers clasping each other close and marching up and down
stage Under this we hear SFX LAUGHTER

INT PICTURE HOUSE NEW YORK - NIGHT 2

A huge New York audience is packed into a magnificent Art-
Deco theatre watching ‘Way Out West’ As LAUREL and HARDY
continue the dance on screen the audience howls rows and
rows of faces full of laughter

CUT TO

We follow the dance on screen (full screen) the
extraordinary grace and daintiness of HARDY and the slapstick
of LAUREL But above all they seem to project such a deep
dependency and affection for each other as if nobody else in
their world exists They come together again LAUREL holds
HARDY’S hand and he twirls then they swap and LAUREL twirls
They skip jauntily up down and then back up the steps
to the saloon and with one final kick enter through
swinging doors The audience in the theatre breaks into
thunderous applause We feel as if we have witnessed magic

CUT TO
BLACK

Silence Then under this we FADE UP SFX of an express train
rattling along Sound gradually increases until we

CUT TO

INT TRAIN - DAY 3

CLOSE UP LAUREL and HARDY sitting together on a train
swaying gently with the motion of the carriage as they speed
through the English countryside Sixteen years have passed
since we last saw them and it’s a shock to suddenly see them
so old and tired neither seemingly in the best of health
LAUREL is much more skinny whilst HARDY is heavier than ever
- now nearly three hundred pounds

Caption
England 1953

HARDY’S mind is pleasantly blank LAUREL ever-industrious
reads a script marking it with his pen Finally LAUREL
turns to HARDY
Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 220217 11

LAUREL
How about if I punch you right on
the nose I haven’t done that in a
long time

HARDY thinks about this for a few moments

HARDY
Can I poke you in the eye

LAUREL
(Nodding)
Or maybe you could punch me in the
throat

HARDY
(After due consideration)
I think I’d prefer the eye

LAUREL
(Offering this up)
I can do the tongue if you punch me
in the throat

AUREL mimes a chop to his throat sticking his tongue out at
the moment of impact (as if caused by it) HARDY laughs -
AUREL can always make him laugh

EXT COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK 4

As the shadows lengthen their steam train thunders north
through a barren wintry English countryside From inside

HARDY (VO)
You know I’m not so sure of my
balance any more Stan

INT TRAIN - DUSK 5

LAUREL is looking at the countryside go by

LAUREL
That’s okay we can just finish
with a song instead of the dance

HARDY
I’m not talking about the stage
show - I mean the scene in this
movie where I cross the river

LAUREL
But it’s historical - Robin Hood
has this fight in the middle of a
log We have to do it

HARDY massages his right knee obviously in some discomfort
He tries straightening the leg - wincing as he does so
Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 170317 12

HARDY
Well all I can do is give it my
best shot

LAUREL
Is there anything they can give you
for that

HARDY

They put me on these blue tablets
I was on the red ones but Lucille

told the doctor they weren’t doing
any good-

LAUREL
-so he put you on the blue ones

HARDY
(Overlaps)
-blue ones

They both nod in agreement
LAUREL
I’1l talk to this producer Miffin -
I’m sure he can cut round you when
we shoot it

HARDY now looks out of the window for a few moments taking
in the view LAUREL starts scribbling again in his notebook

HARDY
Maybe I’11 punch you in the throat

EXT GUEST HOUSE NEWCASTLE - NIGHT 6

To establish a small shabby guest house in the shadow of the
smog-shrouded Tyne Bridge The street is deserted as a taxi
pulls up outside and LAUREL and HARDY get out HARDY looks at
the guest house then turns to LAUREL his expression
betraying his thoughts ‘Is this it’ Theatre impresario
Bernard DELFONT dapper 40s - the boys’ tour promoter -
emerges from the guest house arms outstretched

DELFONT
Stanley Oliver Welcome to England
- welcome to Newcastle

He hurries up to the BOYS and shakes their hands warmly

DELFONT (cont’d)
It’s so wonderful to see you How
was the journey

HARDY
It sure takes it out of you that
train ride up here
Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 240317 13

DELFONT
(Not listening)
Good good

DELFONT signals to his DRIVER waiting in a side street ina
black Rolls Royce

LAUREL
It’s swell of you to come up here
to meet us Mr Delfont

DELFONT

Bernie please This is a
partnership gentlemen I want to do
everything I possibly can to make
sure this tour starts off on the
right foot

HARDY

Yes we wanted to talk to you about
that over dinner - we’re just a
little concerned that some of the
show dates might clash-

DELFONT
Ah so sorry-

HARDY
-with the Robin Hood picture we’re
gonna be doing

The Rolls Royce is now alongside DELFONT he opens the door
and gets in

DELFONT (cont’d)
-such wretched bad luck but I’ve
promised to drop in on one of my
other acts tonight - Norman Wisdom
A blazing new talent - huge fan of
yours

DELFONT shuts the door leans out through the window

DELFONT (cont’d)
And we must nurture the next
generation gentlemen I know you
both feel as passionately about
that as I do We’1ll talk anon

DELFONT waves as he is whisked away in his Rolls Royce
LAUREL and HARDY look on nonplussed LAUREL pulls a beret
from his pocket and puts it on HARDY looks at him puzzled
Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 220217 14

HARDY
Where d’you get that

LAUREL
From a shop It’s handy ‘cos you
can fold it away in your pocket

He demonstrates taking it off folding it up and putting it
in his pocket then pulling it out and putting it on again -
spreading his hands in a ‘what d’you think of that’ gesture

HARDY
Somehow irritated by
this)
Were here to make a movie -
Delfont knows that doesn’t he Stan
The tour is just something we do
while-
Overlapping)
-we’re waiting to get started

LAUREL
Overlapping)
-waiting to get started
Continues)
Don’t worry Our lawyer spelled it
out and it was all agreed up-front
one hundred and ten per cent

HARDY
(Thinks about it)
The extra ten is strangely
comforting

During this the TAXI DRIVER has pulled all their luggage from
the car - a very large trunk (Hardy’s) another case
(Laurel’s) a small valise each and a set of Hardy’s golf
clubs - and drives off leaving them alone on the pavement
with their luggage nobody coming out to help them
Abandoned A look between them

INT GUEST HOUSE NEWCASTLE - NIGHT 7

A female RECEPTIONIST mid-30s watches as the front door
opens allowing in smog from outside Through this enters
LAUREL and HARDY HARDY carrying just the small valise
whilst LAUREL struggles with the big trunk and other case
the golf clubs over his shoulder (as if he’s Hardy’s lackey)
It’s a pre-arranged bit of business they like to do in hotels
and shows how they love to ‘perform’ no matter how small the
audience (in this case just one person - the RECEPTIONIST)

HARDY pompously places his valise on the desk LAUREL heaves
the other luggage behind him and - giving the RECEPTIONIST a
smile - presses the bell for attention HARDY looks at him
‘irritated’ When LAUREL rings it again he slaps his hand
Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 240317 15

AUREL slaps back HARDY’S hand they squabble HARDY gives
AUREL a push LAUREL gives HARDY a push back and he nearly
falls over the trunk which LAUREL has left behind him He
kicks it away angrily LAUREL rings the bell again and now
HARDY pulls the bell away LAUREL looks at him blankly
‘confused’ HARDY sighs gestures to the RECEPTIONIST

HARDY
Now can’t you see with your own two
eyes this nice lady standing here
There’s no need to ring that bell
is there

LAUREL looks at him looks at the RECEPTIONIST He shakes his
head guiltily starting to ‘cry’ HARDY turns back to the
RECEPTIONIST who is spellbound at this ‘show’ just for her

HARDY (contd)
Please excuse my friend now can
somebody show us to our rooms You
should be expecting us - I’m Mr
Hardy and this is my very dear
friend Mr Laurel

The RECEPTIONIST is about to burst

RECEPTIONIST
You just wait ‘til I tell me mam
it’s you We never get anybody
famous stayin’ here - to be honest
I thought you’d retired

HARDY takes the pen from it’s holder and with an extravagant
flourish signs in to the register

HARDY
No no we may be getting old but
were not done yet

LAUREL
You know I’m so old now I walked
into an antique shop the other day
and they bought me
Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 240317 16

The RECEPTIONIST laughs

HARDY
He’s exaggerating of course But
we’ve come a long way since our
first job selling hot dogs at
Custer’s Last Stand

RECEPTIONIST
All me family loves your films -
where are yous gonna be appearin’
then - the Theatre Royal

HARDY
No it’s

He’s forgotten the name - LAUREL answers for him

LAUREL
The Queen’s Hall

RECEPTIONIST
(Surprised)
Queen’s Hall That can’t be right
All the big stars play at the
Theatre Royal That’s where you’1l
be playing

HARDY
I’m sure you’re right
(to Laurel)
It is the Theatre Royal

LAUREL
No It’s the Queen’s Hall

A few moments of uncomfortable silence
RECEPTIONIST (contd)
Well never mind here’s your room
keys
She hands LAUREL and HARDY their keys
HARDY
Thank you
(Looks round expectantly)

Is there a Bell Boy please

INT CORRIDOR GUEST HOUSE NEWCASTLE - NIGHT 8

There are no Bell Boys LAUREL and HARDY struggle along a
corridor to their rooms HARDY - now with the golf clubs over
his shoulder - dragging his heavy trunk behind him LAUREL
stops by his door and as he unlocks it turns to HARDY who
is in the room opposite
Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 240317 16A
LAUREL
My room in ten minutes
HARDY looks at him aghast He still wants to work tonight

LAUREL (contd)
I thought we could run some lines

HARDY
(Barely concealed sarcasm)
Sure Why not

Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 240317 17

HARDY opens the door to his room and enters

INT HARDY’S BEDROOM NEWCASTLE GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT 9

HARDY struggles in with his luggage He turns the light on
and surveys the room shabby and uninviting a tatty
candlewick bedspread on the bed He goes to haul the trunk up
onto his bed but it pops open and a huge cache of tinned
food - ham peaches potatoes corned beef which were on top
of his clothes - tumbles out and rolls all over the floor
HARDY sighs heavily

HARDY
Oh death where is thy sting

EXT GUEST HOUSE NEWCASTLE - NIGHT 10

Yellow light spills from a curtained upper storey window
Over this we hear SFX the clack clack of a typewriter

INT LAUREL’S ROOM NEWCASTLE GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT 11

A meagre coal fire glows in the grate as LAUREL puffing on a
cigarette taps at a battered portable typewriter by the
light of a table lamp A pot of tea and a plate of dog eared
sandwiches has been set out on a coffee table He pauses
pulls the typed page from the typewriter and reads it back

INT JOE SCHENCK’S OFFICE - DAY FLASHBACK 12

A CLOSE UP of a contract the logo of ‘Twentieth Century Fox’
at the top of the page

It’s 1938 and we REVEAL LAUREL on a chair an empty one next
to him flicking through the contract He is in the luxurious
office of executive Joe SCHENCK late 50s Surrounded by wood
panelling leather and portraits of stars of the day - Sonja
Henje Betty Grable Spencer Tracey Tyrone Power - LAUREL
feels uncomfortable out of place The man next to him is
obviously his lawyer (round glasses 40s curly hair slicked
back) and LAUREL hands him the contract LAUREL is acutely
aware that he is keeping SCHENCK waiting he catches him
looking at his watch and tries a smile which is not returned

SCHENCK
You sure he wants to do this Stan
I mean Fox would love to have you
here but

LAUREL
This is what we’ve both been
waiting for Joe I can’t imagine
what’s held him up

LAWYER
Why doesn’t Stanley sign then all
we have to do is have Oliver sign
when he gets here

Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 240317 18

LAUREL
(Taking out his pen)

That’s a good idea isn’t it Joe

SCHENCK - who is quickly losing patience - doesn’t respond
The LAWYER hands LAUREL the contract back and LAUREL hands
him the pen LAUREL realises he needs the pen and takes it

back from the

LAWYER giving him the contract at the same

time Is it genuine confusion or a little bit of business
LAUREL takes pen and contract back from his LAWYER and signs
next to his name leaving Hardy’s blank He looks up tries

another smile
HARDY’S voice

with SCHENCK - again not returned We hear
under this

I wish I was there with you

INT FRONT DESK NEWCASTLE GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT

Back to 1953

the

HARDY is using the hotel telephone to make a
call to his wife

HARDY
(Dreamily)
sitting out the back watching
sun go down

LUCILLE (VO)

What’s the hotel like

HARDY

It’s like a castle set in the
countryside beautiful grounds

(Warming to it)
which go down to a lake with a

little stone bridge over it

The RECEPTIONIST returns to the desk from a back office
HARDY a little embarrassed gives her a polite smile

like kings

HARDY

I am too and this

Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 240317 19

He sees the NIGHT PORTER is watching him so turns away-

HARDY (contd)
-is for you with all my love-

-kisses his finger tips and blows the kiss down the phone

LUCILLE (VO)
I love you too Oliver you know I
do
(Beat slight edge in her
voice)
So how are things with Stanley

HARDY
Oh you know Stan

LUCILLE
How has he been towards you

On HARDY thoughtful for a moment

INT SOUND STAGE - DAY FLASHBACK 14

HARDY serious expression walks on set wearing a dark suit
but carrying an unfamiliar top hat

HAL ROACH
Babe Where have you been You had
me worried for a minute there

He gives a (plainly uncomfortable) HARDY a bear hug

HAL ROACH (contd)
What the hell you’re here now
You’re both here

He gestures and HARDY looks across to someone with his back
to us also wearing a dark suit and top hat being given a
last check over by a MAKE-UP LADY From his build we assume
it must be Laurel HARDY takes position next to an ELEPHANT
with a hot water bottle bandaged to its head The set is a
wooden barn scattered with bales of hay and he’s playing a
vet treating a sick circus elephant As he sits on a stool
LUCILLE carrying a clip board stops by to reassure him

LUCILLE
Mr Hardy everything alright

HARDY
You know first day of school Mrs
Hardy I’m glad you’re here Do you
think it’s going to be ok

LUCILLE
It’s just a movie Babe
Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 240317 20

She squeezes his hand then carries on to her position (as
script supervisor) next to the director GORDON DOUGLAS who
is younger than Horne and less assured in his manner A
WRANGLER hands HARDY a mallet and gives him some last minute
instructions - though HARDY looks totally preoccupied

WRANGLER
(Patting the elephant)
When you touch her knee with the
mallet she’ll lift her leg like
you’re checking her reflexes

ROACH calls over

ROACH
You wanna go for one you two

HARDY looks over again to ‘LAUREL’ and now as he turns we
see that he’s not Laurel It is in fact HARRY LANGDON a
Laurel look-alike who is playing the elephant’s owner
LANGDON is of similar build to Laurel and wears the same
pancake white make up

LANGDON
Ready when you are Babe

We now see that this is Roach’s attempt at a new partnership -
just with different hats LANGDON comes over and stands next
to HARDY He puts his hand lightly on HARDY’S shoulder (and
he involuntarily stiffens at the touch) As he looks around
HARDY becomes aware that various CREW MEMBERS who have
worked on Laurel and Hardy films are avoiding eye contact with
him as they go about their work

ROACH
This is great you and Harry are
gonna be just great together

HARDY looks at LANGDON who spreads his hands and gives him a
blank smile exactly as Laurel would HARDY returns a polite
smile but we can see he’s uncomfortable - that he can’t
escape the feeling he’s betraying Stan He looks to LUCILLE
who tries to encourage him with a smile
Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 220217 21
DOUGLAS
Okay let’s roll camera

He gets the response ‘Rolling’ from sound and camera On
HARDY suppressing a sinking feeling

DOUGLAS (contd)
Aaand - action

ROACH over-excited shouts out simultaneously

ROACH
Action

INT LAUREL’S ROOM NEWCASTLE GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT 15

A closed door SFX KNOCKING from outside LAUREL who has
been frowning in concentration looks up

LAUREL
Just a minute

He quickly stubs his cigarette out and wafts away the smoke
hides the ashtray in the bin then unlocks the door to HARDY
who sniffs theatrically looks at LAUREL suspiciously

HARDY
Do you realise what you’ve done

A beat then LAUREL - going along with it for fun - nods
miserably HARDY enters and turns to LAUREL

HARDY (contd)
Well come on - out with them

LAUREL takes a packet of Chesterfield cigarettes from his
inside pocket and HARDY snatches it off him He takes one
then offers the pack to LAUREL who also takes one HARDY
produces a lighter and they both light up and take deep
puffs HARDY putting the pack back in his pocket

HARDY (contd)
Now isn’t that better Sharing

LAUREL nods big smile on his face
HARDY (contd)
And here’s something else we’re not
supposed to have
He produces a half bottle of Scotch from inside his jacket
LAUREL rustles up a couple of cups and HARDY pours them each

a large measure

HARDY (contd)
For medicinal purposes

They clink cups together and the ‘skit’ ends
Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 170317 22

HARDY (contd)
I’m getting a sinking feeling about
this place Did you see her face
when we told her what theatre we
were playing

LAUREL
Itll be fine Queen’s Hall is a
good theatre

HARDY
Well we gotta make sure we’re in
nicer hotels when the girls arrive

LAUREL
I’1l get onto it

HARDY crosses to the window to peer out into the murky night
with a shiver

HARDY
You heard from Muffin

LAUREL starts to correct his script by hand

LAUREL
Miffin

HARDY
Miffin Is that really his name
Has he given you our shooting dates
yet

LAUREL
I’m waitin’ on a call

HARDY lets the curtain drop and sits down in one of two easy
chairs by the fireside - his leg causing him some pain as he
lowers himself He picks up his cup of Scotch takes a sip

LAUREL (contd)
What do you think about this for a
title ‘Rob ‘Em Good’ You know
playin’ off ‘Robin Hood’ There was
a picture used that in the 20s but
nobody would remember by now

During this HARDY takes a sandwich from the plate on the
coffee table peels back the top and looks suspiciously at
the filling smeared inside wrinkling his nose as he sniffs

HARDY
What is this stuff

LAUREL takes one bites into it

LAUREL
Fish paste It’s the war rationing
Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 220217 23

HARDY
Still
(LAUREL shrugs)
Explains why they looked at me like
I was nuts when I asked for an egg
sandwich

HARDY looks at LAUREL already making corrections to the page
he’s just typed with his pen as he flicks through his work

HARDY (contd)
‘Rob ‘Em Good’ I like that Stan

HARDY takes another sip of his Scotch

LAUREL
I been workin’ on this scene for
the movie where we go into the
castle to rescue Maid Marian and
were hiding behind this curtain-

HARDY decides hunger has got the better of him and - after
liberally sprinkling salt over the filling - tries the
sandwich LAUREL starts to giggle as he tells the story

LAUREL (contd)
-and the guards are lookin’ for us-

He’s really making himself laugh as he tells the story - and
it’s infectious HARDY starts to chuckle too - even though he
doesn’t know the punchline

LAUREL (contd)
-and I’ll show you turn around

HARDY turns round we stay on him as we hear some rustling

LAUREL (OOV) (contd)
Okay

HARDY turns back and sees LAUREL’S shoes poking out from
beneath the curtains in his room

LAUREL (OOV) (contd)
(From behind curtain)
Now you stab me with your sword-

HARDY looks about picks up a shoe horn and getting into
character-

HARDY
A-ha A-ha So you think you can
play that game do you - well you
can’t hide from me

-uses it to stab the curtain at about chest height

Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 220217 24

LAUREL (OOV)
And then you pull the curtain back
and

HARDY pulls the curtain back and there is LAUREL on his
knees below where the ‘sword’ went in to the curtain
kneeling on his shoes like Toulouse-Lautrec looking at
himself in a dressing mirror opposite He looks so ridiculous
that HARDY howls with laughter - which makes LAUREL laugh
even harder

LAUREL (cont’d)
Isn’t that silly

HARDY pulls his shoes off and - with some painful grunting -
lowers himself to kneel on them the same as LAUREL Now
they’re both doing it - getting a little hysterical with
laughter as they look at themselves in the mirror

HARDY
Now I’m down here - I can’t get up
again

This sets them both off again LAUREL tries to get up-
LAUREL
Neither can I
(Gasping for air)
We’re stuck

We go OUT on the boys howling with laughter at themselves in
the mirror

EXT QUEEN’S HALL THEATRE - DAY 16

A grey day the rain falling A provincial English theatre
small and shabby - Hardy’s sinking feeling was spot on An
OLD MAN passes oblivious as a WORKMAN pastes up a poster

Hollywood’s Greatest Comedy Couple
Stan LAUREL and Oliver HARDY

Under this we hear the incredulous voice of Stan’s wife IDA

As the shot TRACKS we see LAUREL in a public phone box next
to the theatre on a transatlantic call

LAUREL
Ida he’s put this tour together
for us and we didn’t exactly have
too many other offers did we
Anyway we got the movie to look
forward to

He glances at the little Queen’s Hall Theatre outside

LAUREL (contd)
Okay the theatre is a little on the
small side but that means it’1ll be
easier to sell it out

IDA (VO)
How is Oliver - is he pulling
weight

LAUREL

He’s doing fine

(Quickly moves on)
Tell me all the news How are the
ducks

IDA (VO)
Well I try to get them into duck
house at night but-

The pips sound he has to quickly insert more coins

LAUREL
Hello Ida
IDA (VO)
Stanley
LAUREL
Oh thank goodness I thought I’d
lost you

He looks glumly at the rain spattering against the windows of
the phone box

LAUREL (contd)
I just wanted to tell you how much
I’m missing you and how cold the
bed is without you
Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 220217 26

IDA (VO)
I am missing you too I am trying
not to cry each night

INT BACKSTAGE QUEEN’S HALL THEATRE NEWCASTLE - NIGHT 17

Opening night LAUREL and HARDY are in costume preparing to
go on HARDY sits himself on a hospital bed and a stage hand
(BILLY BRADY 20s) encases his leg in an oversized plaster
cast LAUREL glances through a crack in the curtain and
worried sees the house is barely half full BRADY attaches a
cable to HARDY’S plaster cast and starts to hoist it up like
it’s in traction BRADY glances over to LAUREL and sees he is
going through his pre-show ritual of checking his cuffs are
held in place by paper clips and that there are no heels on
his boots BRADY plucks up the courage to talk to him

BRADY
You worked with my grandad Mr
Laurel

LAUREL looks up at him

BRADY (contd)
He told me how you never have heels
on your boots to make you walk
funny

LAUREL
Your grandad

BRADY
Billy Brady I was named after him

LAUREL looks at him BRADY does a wide-eyed goofy smile and
a camp flutter of his hands

BRADY (contd)
‘Billy Brady - He’s No Lady’

Suddenly the mists part and LAUREL realises who this man is

LAUREL
Oh my goodness it’s like staring
straight into the past
(Shakes his hand warmly)
Youre Billy’s grandson he was a
wonderful comic Very funny drag
act

BRADY
(To HARDY)
He always said Mr Hardy that
Stan were obsessed with his comedy
Never stopped working on his act -
even though he reckoned in them
days it were crap

Stan and Ollie - Green Revisions 110417 27

HARDY
Nothing much has changed there
Billy

BRADY laughs - so does LAUREL

LAUREL
He was a very good friend of mine
your grandad was - how is he

BRADY
Oh he passed away a few years ago

LAUREL seems very moved by this

LAUREL
I’m sorry to hear that

The STAGE MANAGER comes out to give them all a heads up

STAGE MANAGER
Curtain up in one minute Stan

LAUREL nods his okay

BRADY
He was on stage right up ‘til the
end Did a panto the night before
he died

HARDY listens to this as BRADY wheels his bed to centre
stage LAUREL takes a position in the wings and BRADY now
comes over and hands him a paper bag and a bunch of flowers

BRADY (contd)
He was very weak but he was
determined to get through it

This seems to hit home with LAUREL who as the lights dim
falls quiet He looks to HARDY alone in bed in the backstage
gloom

INT QUEEN’S HALL THEATRE NEWCASTLE - NIGHT 18

There’s a buzz of expectation out front then the orchestra
strikes up ‘The Dance Of The Cuckoos’ Laurel and Hardy’s
instantly recognisable theme tune LAUREL looks across to
HARDY and they exchange that same nod Then stage lights up
curtain open and loud applause as the audience sees HARDY on
stage in the bed LAUREL silently counts in his head then-
LAUREL strides on stage to another round of warm applause
clutching the bunch of flowers and paper bag blank
expression The sketch begins

LAUREL
Hi Ollie how are you

Stan and Ollie - Green Revisions 110417

HARDY
Never mind how I am - what took you
so long to get here

LAUREL
Well they said no visitors so I
said I was your son and it worked
like a charm

HARDY
My son You have a lot of nerve
telling them I was your father

LAUREL
I couldn’t tell them you were my
mother

HARDY
Of course you couldn’t I’ve never
even been married

Big laughs - the audience are loving it

HARDY
What have you got there

27A

Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 240317 28

LAUREL
I brought you some hard boiled eggs
and some nuts

HARDY looks to the audience exasperated and they laugh The
reaction is warm and genuine but the theatre is only half
full - there are empty seats everywhere

HARDY
Now you know I cant eat hard
boiled eggs and nuts If you wanted
to bring me something why didnt
you bring me a box of candy

LAUREL
Well they cost too much

HARDY
What has that got to do with it

LAUREL
And you didnt pay me for the last
box I brought you

Laughter LAUREL offers HARDY the bag

LAUREL
Have one

HARDY
No I’d rather not
(To the audience with
disgust)
Hard boiled eggs and nuts
LAUREL ignores him takes an egg out and starts to peel it
and eat it HARDY watches incredulous as Laurel pulls a
salt cellar from his pocket and sprinkles some on

INT BACKSTAGESTAGE QUEEN’S HALL THEATRE NEWCASTLE - NIGHT

Helped by BRADY and another STAGE HAND LAUREL and HARDY -
who winces as he jars his knee - do a quick change into their
crumpled suits and Bowler hats ready for the finale

HARDY
(Dismayed)
What’s going on out there All
those empty seats

LAUREL though also concerned doesn’t respond - he nods to
the STAGE MANAGER
Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 240317 28A

19aA INT QUEEN’S HALL THEATRE NEWCASTLE - NIGHT 19aA

‘The Dance Of The Cuckoos’ plays again and the curtain
rises LAUREL waits for a particular note then steps out on
set but he only manages two paces before HARDY reaches out
and pulls him back He goes out first in this partnership
Laughter But as HARDY strolls out self importantly LAUREL
kicks him up the ass More laughter Finally they both walk
out together to warm applause They go into a bowing routine
to the side to the front then towards each other - clashing
heads Laughter LAUREL sees HARDY put his hand on his knee
to push himself straight again - sees a flash of pain across
his face HARDY covers it well as he fiddles with his tie
LAUREL takes his hat off and scratches his hair underneath

LAUREL
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for
making us feel so welcome on our
first night back in England We
hope you’ve enjoyed our bit of fun
this evening - we’ve sure enjoyed
ourselves haven’t we Ollie
Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 170317 29

HARDY
We certainly have Stanley weve
been made to feel right at home
here in Newcastle and now we’d
like to finish-

He gives LAUREL a brief nod of reassurance about his knee-

HARDY (contd)
-with a little dance routine we
like to do Music please maestro

The tune to ‘At The Ball That’s All’ strikes up

HARDY (contd)
Stanley

Formally HARDY holds his hand out and LAUREL takes it as if
he were his dance partner and they begin to perform the same
dance routine we saw in ‘Way Out West’ Though older and
slower they still dance beautifully the affection their
characters have for each other shining through They come
together to finish hold hands and take a bow They look out
at the half full auditorium but still keep up their smiles

CUT TO

19A EXT STAIRWELL TRAIN STATION - DAY 19A

LAUREL and HARDY puff and blow as they clamber up a long
staircase carrying their luggage HARDY golf clubs again
over his shoulder drags the heavy trunk behind him

LAUREL
It was a little slow last night
wasn’t it

HARDY
Slow We could have invited the
audience back for a party in our
hotel suite - there’d have been
plenty of room

LAUREL smiles HARDY is struck with a sudden thought

HARDY (contd)
We got to be careful Muffin doesn’t
come see us ‘til the houses pick up
- we don’t want him getting cold
feet about the movie

LAUREL
Youre right I’1l put him off ‘til
we get to London

LAUREL reaches the top rests his case looks about for where
to go next

Stan and Ollie - Yellow Revisions 310317 30

LAUREL (contd)
(Takes out a slip of
paper )
Glasgow train 805 Platform
Four
(Looks about)
Which way is Platform Four

HARDY
(Still struggling up the
stairs)
805 What time is it now

LAUREL looks at his wrist - he’s not wearing a watch

LAUREL
I don’t have my watch on

HARDY instinctively brings up his left wrist to look at his
watch - but in doing so he lets go of the heavy trunk
which promptly slides away down the staircase A moment as
they both watch it trundle to the bottom and come to a stop -
an inescapable echo of the piano famously plummeting down
those long flight of stairs in their movie ‘The Music Box’

HARDY
You know one of us is going to have
to get that

LAUREL
It’s me isn’t it

HARDY
It certainly is

INT RESTAURANT CAR TRAIN - DAY 20

HARDY lies back in his seat bad leg propped up dozing
LAUREL brings back two Scotches from the buffet bar He sets
them down then resumes his seat the remains of some
sandwiches and tea in front of them LAUREL glances at HARDY
takes a sip from his Scotch then nudges him

LAUREL
Babe
(No response so louder)
Babe

HARDY wakes up sees LAUREL With a grimace of pain he sits
up bringing his leg down from the seat opposite

HARDY
What is it

LAUREL
I got you a drink

HARDY sees the Scotch takes it and downs it
Stan and Ollie - Yellow Revisions 310317 30aA
HARDY
Thank you

LAUREL now hands him a few typed pages of script HARDY looks
at them confused for a moment then takes them
Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 170317 30A

LAUREL
I been workin’ on some new scenes
for ‘Rob ‘Em Good’ thought we
could run ‘em

HARDY sees a pot of tea and some cups in front of them puts
the script down and pours himself a cup

LAUREL (contd)
We don’t have to if you don’t want
to
Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 220217 31

HARDY
No no
(Almost as an aside)
I know my place

It’s a little barb he throws out but LAUREL doesn’t take it
With great delicacy HARDY begins a long ritual dropping four
cubes of sugar in then milk and carefully stirring making
sure the lumps dissolve He then spills some red tablets from
a bottle onto the little table in front of him

LAUREL
Knee still bad

HARDY nods as he counts out four and puts the others back in
the bottle

LAUREL (contd)
I thought you were on the blue
tablets

HARDY
I already had the blue ones and
it’s still killin’ me I thought
I’d give the red ones one more
chance

LAUREL
Well won’t the blue ones get upset
about that

HARDY
I never thought about it

LAUREL
It’s got to be one or the other
you can’t keep both of them on the
go at the same time

Finally after one last emphatic stir HARDY puts the first
tablet in his mouth picks his cup up with a crooked little
finger and takes a sip to wash it down

LAUREL (contd)
-they’1l get jealous and start
fighting over you

HARDY immediately reacts pulls a face but is forced to
swallow

HARDY
Why didn’t you tell me it was cold

LAUREL
I thought you knew

HARDY looks at him exhales in frustration and downs the
other three tablets quickly with another gulp of cold tea
Stan and Ollie - Green Revisions 110417 32

He shudders with distaste then picks the script up again and
starts to read through it But he’s distracted can’t
concentrate He turns to LAUREL

HARDY
That guy who went on stage the
night before he died

LAUREL
Billy Brady

HARDY
Yeh

LAUREL
Wasn’t that something to still be
working in his old age like that

HARDY
That’s what’s been bothering me He
wasn’t working he was dying
Didn’t you find it sad

As LAUREL thinks about this HARDY takes the flask from him
and has a sip

LAUREL
Well look at Jimmy Finlayson

HARDY
What about him

LAUREL
Nobody even knew he’d died just
lay there in his bed all alone He
finished too soon - same cafe every
morning reading the papers trying
to make that stretch to midday so
he’s only got the afternoon to
kill Who wants that

HARDY has another sip
HARDY
Maybe he was happy doing nothing
There’s an awful lot to be said for
it

EXT EMPIRE THEATRE GLASGOW - DAY 21

(ending with them banging heads in the middle) They get
laughs but we see how pale and sweaty HARDY is - the
physical demands of this type of touring taking a toll

INT GLASGOW PUB - NIGHT 25

That evening LAUREL and HARDY glum and apprehensive after
another poorly attended show sit in a corner booth with
DELFONT who tucks into a pub meal of sausage and mash
LAUREL and HARDY don’t eat but have pints of beer in front of
them and both smoke heavily a thick haze hanging over the
booth Nothing is said until finally DELFONT finishes his
last mouthful and dabs vigorously at his mouth with a napkin

DELFONT
Now then gentlemen
(More dabbing puts napkin
down )
Terrific though the show is and it
really is terrific-

HARDY
Thank you

DELFONT
-we really do have to have a little
think about where we go from here

Sweating profusely HARDY pours himself a glass of water from
the ever-present jug he has at the dinner table

HARDY
We have new material we can work
in don’t we Stan

LAUREL
We have a double door routine we
can do set in a railway station
and as soon as Babe’s leg is better
we can bring back the dance number
at the end

HARDY
It’s getting better all the time

DELFONT
Yes I think that would all help
enormously And of course it’s
early days and all that but
unfortunately the houses have thus
far been extremely disappointing

HARDY
But that’s because we’re playing in
all these little theatres

DELFONT
Yes and I’m absolutely furious
about that
Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 220217

HARDY
But you booked us in them What
happened to the big ones we played
last time we were over

DELFONT
Well we couldn’t be sure how ticket
sales would go you see and-

LAUREL suddenly getting it looks thunderstruck

LAUREL
Wait a minute wait a minute you
want to close us down

DELFONT
Absolutely not That’s the last
thing I want to do

HARDY
We haven’t even done a week

LAUREL
When do you want us to finish

DELFONT
I thought it would be best if we
wrapped it up before you got to
London

HARDY
What

DELFONT
That would give us another ten
shows or so With a bit of a push -
‘last shows’ that sort of thing -
and the advance bookings we already
have we should just about be able
to wash our hands

HARDY
But the producer of the movie’s
coming to see the show in London
next month isn’t he Stan

LAUREL
And Lucille and Ida are coming over
in a couple of weeks - we can’t
finish early

HARDY
We made it perfectly clear-
(Grasps at the figure)
-one hundred and ten per cent
clear that the only reason we came
over for this tour was to be
available for that movie
Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 240317 38

DELFONT looks at them both considering the situation

DELFONT
I thought you’d jump at the chance
Neither of you looks particularly
well

HARDY
I’m in perfect health

LAUREL
And so is he

HARDY
Mr Delfont we need this tour to
continue

DELFONT

And of course I’m enormously
sympathetic Enormously But your
audience doesn’t quite seem to be
what it was and advance bookings
are very slow It’s a wonderful
show very charming and sweet but
perhaps tastes have changed All
good things must come to an end
that sort of thing

LAUREL
We can turn it around

DELFONT

The public moves on So many don’t
even come to the theatre now just
stay at home watching their
television sets watching your
films on their television sets
come to think of it - and you not
even getting any residuals

(Shakes his head and tuts)
Filthy business

HARDY
Just tell us what you want us to do
and well do it

DELFONT looks from HARDY who wipes the sweat from his
forehead with a napkin to LAUREL who looks at him
expectantly

DELFONT
Well if you really want to keep
this tour going then all I can
think of is you’re going to have
to get out there and publicize it

(He looks at them both)
(MORE )
Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 170317 38A

DELFONT (CONTD)
Which would mean a very large
amount of extra work for you both
making personal appearances
opening shops meeting local
dignitaries and so on and so forth
And for broadly speaking very
little extra money
Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 220217 39

LAUREL
I take it that ‘very little’
actually means no extra money at
all

HARDY
That we would have to flog
ourselves half to death for
nothing

DELFONT
Well
(Sees in their eyes that
there’s no point lying)
Yes

LAUREL and HARDY exchange A beat then

HARDY
Well okay

DELFONT
Sorry

LAUREL

Well do it
DELFONT is taken aback by how upbeat and defiant they seem

EXT STREET - DAY 26

BLACK AND WHITE NEWSREEL FOOTAGE On a freezing cold day a
good-sized crowd has gathered to watch LAUREL and HARDY pose
for some shots with local PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS The boys are
wearing uniforms of white overalls and black peaked caps with
scarves wrapped round their necks to keep them warm and they
are surrounded by young SCHOOL CHILDREN

NEWSREEL COMMENTARY (VO)
Taking time out from a nationwide
tour of music halls - tickets still
available - Messrs Laurel and
Hardy were in Merthyr Tydfil this
week for to lend their support to a
new road safety programme

JUMP CUT TO

The BOYS now stand in the middle of a Zebra crossing holding
‘Lollipop’ signs saying ‘STOP CHILDREN CROSSING’ as they
wave the CHILDREN cross the road NOTE - LAUREL’S SIGN IS
BIGGER THAN HARDY’S

NEWSREEL COMMENTARY
On a bitterly cold day the boys had
luckily come prepared

Stan and Ollie - Green Revisions 110417 40

As the CHILDREN cross HARDY stamps his feet and blows his
hands to keep warm Meanwhile LAUREL pulls a hot water bottle
from inside his coat and a cup from his pocket then - to
laughs - pours some tea into it from the hot water bottle
HARDY rolls his eyes in exasperation - then suddenly notices
that Laurel’s sign is bigger than his Annoyed he grabs it
off him and hands LAUREL his smaller one

NEWSREEL COMMENTARY (contd)
Although with these two around
nothing ever goes quite to plan

Looking at his smaller ‘Lollipop’ LAUREL decides to get
revenge by bopping HARDY on the head with it HARDY howls and
touches his head gingerly then responds in kind - and a
squabble quickly develops the two of them attacking each
other with their ‘Lollipops’

water

LAUREL turns round to the bed side table but in doing so
pulls HARDY’S leg up even higher and the counterweight lands
on HARDY’S head HARDY lets out an ‘oohhh’ LAUREL quickly
turns back to HARDY

LAUREL
What’s the matter

HARDY
My head hurts

LAUREL
I’1l get the doctor

LAUREL again turns around lifting HARDY’S leg and landing

allows himself to be ‘distracted’ and turns away to one side
smiling to fans and doesn’t see LAUREL put his bag of chips

his bag away just as HARDY turns back and starts to eat his
chips with a big smile HARDY looks at him suspiciously

impatiently The auditorium is jam-packed full the audience -
spread across all ages - happy expectant

On stage HARDY can wait no more gets up and exits through a
door into the waiting room At this exact moment LAUREL comes
out onto the stage through another door next to the first
door LOUD APPLAUSE as he looks around puzzled for Hardy
Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 170317 41A

LAUREL checks his watch then decides to go and look for him -
but once again at the precise moment he exits through his
door HARDY enters through the other one BIG LAUGHS

expressions supremely skilful As the sketch continues the
laughter builds the audience loving what they see At one
point they both exit the stage then enter together The
CHILDREN in the audience are HOWLING but LAUREL and HARDY
‘don’t notice’ each other turning in the wrong direction to
look for each other and exiting together A moment then they
enter again and walk smack bang into each other - bringing
the house down The audience is on it’s feet APPLAUSE CHEERS
and CRIES ringing down They beam in appreciation blowing
kisses as the curtain falls

INT BACK STAGE PALACE THEATRE PLYMOUTH - NIGHT 38

Were going to give him a piece of
my mind aren’t we Stanley

Yeh that’s a nice line
(Beat thoughtful)
Is this movie happening Stan

LAUREL

Yes Of course it is Why d’you ask
that

Oh it’s just that Lucille will
ask me about it and I know you’ve
been struggling to get through to

-Miffin

LAUREL

HARDY
I mean I’m enjoying how the show’s
going but it’s the movie we’re
doing this for isn’t it

LAUREL
That’s right - and then one thing
leads to another

HARDY
Because we can’t keep touring like
this forever can we

Before LAUREL can answer a GUARD walks past their
compartment calling out to passengers

GUARD
London terminus next and final
stop

They look at each other then get up excitedly They go out
into the corridor and pull down the window on the door so
they can lean outside It’s a bit of a squeeze but - hair
blowing in the wind - they can see the unmistakable London
skyline fast approaching With excited faces they shake
hands delighted to have made it to the capital

EXT WEST END CINEMA - DAY 41

Taxis and red buses weave past with adverts for Bovril
Players cigarettes and Schweppes on the side Men in hats and

end LAUREL walks along (to where we don’t yet know) then
pauses to study a poster outside a cinema ‘Abbott and Costello
Go To Mars’ The blurb tells us they are ‘Hollywood’s No One
Comedy Duo’ This is the double act that has effectively
replaced Laurel and Hardy in the affections of modern
moviegoers LAUREL looks at their young faces the silver
space suits the shiny rocket the future

A MAN walks up and stands next to him also to look at the
poster A few moments then LAUREL aware of the MAN standing
on his shoulder turns to look at him At the same time the
MAN turns to LAUREL and gives him a polite smile LAUREL goes
to smile back but realises the MAN is tremendously boss-eyed -
his eyes literally looking in opposite directions LAUREL
double takes The MAN politely raises his hat then walks
away OUT on LAUREL

EXT STRAND TUBE STATION - DAY 42

Let me call you Sweetheart Im in

Let me hear you whisper that you
love me too
Keep the da-da hmm hmm in your eyes
so true
Let me call you Sweetheart Im in
love with you

He passes a little florist’s stall outside the tube station
is about to go down the stairs when he decides he’s feeling
so good he wants a buttonhole He selects a red carnation
and with great delicacy pulls a shilling from his wallet to
pay for it Back to the song he hums and whistles as he
carries on jauntily into the tube station pinning the
carnation to his lapel as he goes

She starts to write everything down

Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 170317 46

RECEPTIONIST
Do you have an appointment Mr
Lauren

He doesn’t pick her up on mispronouncing his name

LAUREL
We keep missing each other on the
telephone so I thought if I dropped
by that would be the easiest thing

RECEPTIONIST
Because he’s not here right now

LAUREL
(Beat thinks about this)
That’s okay I can wait I think
I’ve been speaking to another girl
on the telephone about this - I’ve
been speaking to her for a while

RECEPTIONIST
She’s left Are you sure you want
to wait He may be quite a while

LAUREL
Well I’m here now aren’t I

RECEPTIONIST
Take a seat over there Mr Lauren-
(Indicates a row of
chairs)

ASSISTANT
A beautiful piece sir

HARDY looks at it but his eye is taken by one above it which
is much much classier with alternating diamonds and rubies

ASSISTANT
Mr Laurel not with you today

HARDY preoccupied answers without looking up
Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 170317 46A

HARDY
Oh he’s just got himself a new job
mending broken biscuits

The ASSISTANT laughs

Rigor mortis hasn’t set in just yet-

He points to the expensive bracelet

HARDY
Pardon me for just a moment

He takes his wallet from his back pocket turns away from the
ASSISTANT opens it and counts through the notes inside with
his fingers He doesn’t have enough Not nearly A thoughtful
frown for a moment then he turns back to the ASSISTANT

HARDY (contd)
I wonder if you could just hold it
for me and I’1l1 be right back with
the full amount
(Motions ‘hurrying feet’
with his fingers)
-‘tout suite’

INT OFFICE RECEPTION - DAY 47

LAUREL patient as ever is still being kept waiting He
catches the eye of the RECEPTIONIST and gives her a familiar
ruffle of his hair into a mad quiff But this produces no
response - she simply thinks him rather odd So he tries
something else putting his hat back on he puts his finger
in his mouth and blows it like it’s a valve He can see the
RECEPTIONIST trying not to look but finding herself
wondering what on earth he’s doing He puts his finger in
again and blows harder by leaning the brim of his hat back
slightly against the wall behind him he makes it look as if
his hat is lifting off his head She watches this but
there’s still no laugh - she just looks vaguely
uncomfortable embarrassed even LAUREL gives up

fingers five of the ten pounds notes in there (leaving
another tenner and a fiver)

he sent to you before you left the
United States that all the finance
wasn’t in place

LAUREL
Yes but I thought he’d have it all
lined up by now

CYNTHIA
He wanted you to know that he did
everything he could to bring the
project together but he feels sure
you’1ll understand that the market
is very challenging at the moment
and that it just wasn’t possible

HARDY
Did they get all that okay

JAUREL
It was fine it’ll get a laugh

sUCILLE

(Sarcastic)
Well I’m awfully glad about that

nice to say hello to my husband
after eight weeks without
immediately being pressed into one
of your skits Stanley

IDA
It was just small funny

LUCILLE
Is that what it was

LUCILLE
To think of her in there with all
those rooms and the soldiers
outside looking after her Isn’t
she’s just the sweetest little
doll

JAUREL
What about if we knock on the door
and ask for a cup of sugar

sUCILLE
Don’t you dare

But then she laughs when she realises LAUREL is just kidding

HARDY
You know we been counting the days
‘til you got here All forty six of

them

LUCILLE
Oh Oliver that is the sweetest
thing

HARDY can’t look at LAUREL He busies himself sprinkling more
salt on his food

SUCILLE (cont’d)
How’s the movie coming along

Stanley

JAUREL
It’s all set up for when we finish
the tour

HARDY

The producer is this fellow called
Muffin and Stan’s re-written the
script for him and then-

LUCILLE
Oliver that’s enough salt

HARDY immediately stops

LUCILLE (cont’d)
You know it’s bad for your blood
pressure

HARDY
Sorry honey just force of habit
Anyway the producer’s going to
come and watch the show next week
isn’t that right Stan
Stan and Ollie - Yellow Revisions 310317 55

LAUREL
Yeh he said he’d try and get
along

LUCILLE wonders about this response Why is he only going to
‘try’ to see them

HARDY
And Stan’s been looking after me
wonderfully making sure daddy
takes all his tablets

He kisses the ends of his fingers and blows them to her like
he always does

sUCILLE
Has he been taking the blue ones
Stanley
JAUREL
Blue I been giving him green ones
sUCILLE
Green Oh my goodness what are

they
She looks at HARDY worried He just smiles nervously

HARDY
He’s just kidding

LUCILLE
(quietly to herself)
I’m not finding that funny

HARDY secretly glares at LAUREL - not the time or place to
joke Suddenly IDA announces

IDA
I was dancer I dance for Preston
Sturges I dance for Harold Lloyd

And there’s no way Stanley that he
can do the scene in this movie
where he falls into the river

LAUREL shoots a glance to HARDY who looks embarrassed
Stan and Ollie - Yellow Revisions 310317 56

HARDY
I was telling her about the

IDA

They can use double

HARDY
That’s what I told her

LUCILLE thinks about biting back but decides against it She
places her cutlery on her plate finished

LUCILLE
Well I’m ready for an early night

She looks to HARDY who is lying on the bed watching her

LUCILLE (cont’d)
I was so worried you were going to
go out and buy me something we
couldn’t afford
Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 240317 57

HARDY
In future I am only buying you
things I don’t have enough money
for

He tries to joke about it but she can see he’s downcast She
goes over to the bed sits next to him

LUCILLE
You don’t have to buy me anything
youre everything I could ever
want

LUCILLE takes off her dressing gown and gets in bed with
HARDY who cuddles up to her arms around her

HARDY
This is what I’ve been waiting for

LUCILLE smiles squeezes his arm contentedly

HARDY (contd)
Why are you interested in a fat old
man like me

This is clearly an old joke between them

LUCILLE
Hey you that’s my husband you’re
talking about I love you and you
can’t stop me

LUCILLE shuts her eyes and tries to relax

HARDY
How was the trip over with Ida

LUCILLE
You know Ida exhausting When she
gets something in her head she
wont let it go ‘til she’s worried
it to death and God forbid anyone
should raise the slightest
criticism of Stanley

Hardy laughs

LUCILLE (contd)
Has he been pushing you too hard
Babe

HARDY
(Tired sigh)
Well it’s more difficult than I
first thought

HARDY closes his eyes She looks at him worried how hard
he’s pushing himself She strokes his forehead

LAUREL
He’s been like that with all his
wives Jumps around after them the
whole time trying to please them

IDA
You can learn this

LAUREL smiles

LAUREL

But she’s been good for him
considering the state he was in

(Thinks about this)
That we were both in

(Turns to IDA)
But now we don’t smoke and we don’t
drink and we’re much happier

IDA
He should say ‘thank you’ to you
for all you do for him You could
have said long time ago ‘goodbye
Oliver’

LAUREL
That’s all in the past where it
should stay

A WAITER brings them over cups of coffee each and also places
a Scotch in front of LAUREL

LAUREL (contd)
Thank you

IDA
Are you crazy Take it back

LAUREL
(To WAITER)
It’s okay
(To IDA)
I’m not going to drink it

LAUREL holds the tumbler up to his nose

LAUREL (contd)
I just wanted to smell it

LAUREL breathes in the aroma of the Scotch

Stan and Ollie - Yellow Revisions 310317 59

Bad for diabetes

But LAUREL continues to toy with it Annoyed IDA snatches it
from him and downs it in one

IDA (contd)

Now you can’t drink

I don’t want to lose you Stanley
He puckers up and she gives him a kiss

LAUREL

And nobody even knows you’re really

She gives him a weary smile and a little shove

A lone guitarist picks out the intro to ‘Trail Of The
Lonesome Pine’ The BOYS sing together in harmony

HARDY

(Singing)
On a mountain in Virginia
stands a lonesome pine
Just below is the cabin home
of a little girl of mine
Her name is June and very very
soon shell belong to me
For I know shes waiting there for
me ‘neath that lone pine tree

LAUREL AND HARDY
In the blue ridge mountains of
Virginia
On the trail of the lonesome pine
In the pale moon shine our hearts
entwine
Where she carved her name and I
carved mine
Oh June like the mountains Im
blue
like the pine I am lonesome for you
In the blue ridge mountains of
Virginia
On the trail of the lonesome pine

Suddenly LAUREL hogs the vocal singing in such an impossibly
deep voice that HARDY is put off

LAUREL
(Singing)
In the blue ridge mountains of

on the trail of the lonesome pine
HARDY annoyed gestures to the wings and a STAGE HAND

hurries on with a mallet for him HARDY tests the weight with
a few practice swings as LAUREL continues-

HARDY prepares to take over LAUREL now continues ‘soprano’

with the money - variety club patrons LORD and LADY WARLEY

attentive host he fills their glasses and laughs at their

I have many offers to perform on

INT DRESSING ROOM PALLADIUM THEATRE LONDON - NIGHT 63

HARDY full of energy is on his feet clutching his script
Still on a high from how well the show went he (and this

time not Laurel) has insisted on running lines from ‘Robin
Hood’ LAUREL by contrast sits at his dressing table
finishing removing his make up He is guilty downcast
struggling with the knowledge that the movie has been canned -
and that he hasn’t yet told HARDY

HARDY
This line Robin Hood has when he
says he steals from the rich and
gives to the poor - there’s a gag
in there somewhere Stan

LAUREL

Babe the girls are waiting And
Delfont’s got some people he wants
us to meet from his charity

HARDY

We just gotta work it up some more
What day’s Muffin comin’ to watch
the show

LAUREL
He didn’t say

HARDY
He should have been here tonight
Went big tonight

LAUREL decides that the time has finally come to tell the
truth about the movie

LAUREL
Babe there’s something I gotta
tell you-

HARDY

(Suddenly stopping pacing)
How about we tell Robin Hood he’s
got it all wrong and he should
steal from the poor and give to the
rich Or something like that

LAUREL
The thing is

LAUREL’S voice chokes Is he still going to tell him
HARDY
You can play around with that Stan

can’t you

LAUREL
Well you see

Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 220217 63

LAUREL had every intention of confessing all but now that
HARDY has planted this thought in his mind the chance to
create something takes over As he thinks about the scene
slowly LAUREL’S expression changes from a frown to a smile

LAUREL (contd)
How about we give to the poor by
stealing from the poor and cutting
out the middle man

HARDY
That’s it

HARDY heads for the door continuing as ‘Friar Hardy’
HARDY (contd)
Stealing from the rich to give to
the poor - who ever heard of
anything so ridiculous

As LAUREL follows him out we see that he has abandoned all
thoughts of confessing - his creative juices are flowing

DELETED 64

INT BACKSTAGE PALLADIUM THEATRE LONDON - NIGHT 65

the (darkened) stage

HARDY
(‘Friar Hardy’)
It’s obvious - steal from the poor
and give to the poor and thereby
cutting out the middle man

LAUREL
(‘Stanley-A-Dale’ )
And the rich need never be any the
wiser

HARDY
(Friar Hardy’
emphatically)
Precisely

They emerge into the wings of the theatre They continue
their journey across the empty stage towards an exit at the
side of the auditorium leading up to the bar - where they
know everybody is waiting for them

(Out of character)
That’s great Stan that’s funny

But as they cross the stage HARDY - still excited and
animated - sees a couple of brooms and stops to pick one up
He throws LAUREL the other

Then one more swish underneath -
Robin Hood will jump

LAUREL positions himself behind HARDY as if standing on the
log behind him

LAUREL (contd)
And I’m standing behind you I tap
you on the shoulder and say “watch
he doesn’t hit you on the leg”
(Getting into it)
And then he cracks you one-

LAUREL mimes crashing his ‘staff’ across HARDY’S head HARDY
howls in pain and gingerly touches his sore skull

reach inside and pull out a great
big salmon-

HARDY mimes feeling a fish flapping around inside his cassock
and pulls it out He looks up at LAUREL-

LAUREL (contd)
-and I just go-

LAUREL spreads his hands in a helpless gesture
LAUREL (contd)
“I didn’t put it there” -and then
I’1l give you a line from there to
finish and that’s the scene

A round of applause which allows everybody to return to their
private conversations As LAUREL turns back to IDA he grabs -
without thinking - a glass of champagne from a WAITER

IDA
(Sternly)
Stanley

He hands it to her and she drinks it

LAUREL
I think we got something here - the
more I drink the drunker she gets

‘Sshh’ her She lowers her voice but is getting really angry

LUCILLE (cont’d)
And please tell me how can they be
a matter of weeks away from making
this movie and still not had any
shooting dates confirmed Stanley
This is just such a ridiculous
situation

IDA feels compelled to defend her husband
IDA

Maybe ridiculous but situation is
not Stanley’s fault

really watch them I remember the
one about the piano though You
pushed it up those stairs didn’t
you

(to LADY WARLEY)
Have you seen that one

LADY WARLEY
No

LORD WARLEY

It’s very good they push this piano
up the top of the stairs you see
and it’s a long way it goes all
the way to the top and then the
bloody thing goes all the way down
to the bottom again And then
you’ve got to push it all the way
back up and would you believe it
goes down to the bottom again

HARDY
Yes that’s what happened

LADY WARLEY
Was the piano damaged

HARDY
Would you excuse us for a moment

HARDY steers LAUREL away

Well that’s obviously what you
think because you’re still talking
about it with her

LAUREL
This is a load of baloney - It’s
just too silly for words

HARDY
You think this is all my fault
because I went off and did a movie
with someone else sixteen years
ago Is that what you think You
weren’t there any more You left
the studio

LAUREL
I was fired

HARDY
Because you were a pain in the ass
You wouldn’t negotiate with Hal I
was under contract I had to do
that movie without you

LAUREL
Well that’s not how I see it

HARDY
How do you see it Stan

LAUREL
Well if we’re puttin’ our cards on

A tented back stage area LAUREL enters to find HARDY already
seated at the far end of the tent avoiding his gaze

LAUREL
Why d’you leave without me

HARDY doesn’t answer An ORGANIZER enters at Hardy’s end

ORGANIZER
Is there anything I can get you
gentlemen

HARDY
Would you be so kind as to get me a
cup of tea

There are some tea things on a table by LAUREL

ORGANIZER
Of course

LAUREL gets up and starts to pour himself a cup

LAUREL
I’1l do it

HARDY
(To ORGANIZER)
Thank you if it’s all the same Id
rather you did it

For a split second she is confused then works out that all
is not well between the boys

ORGANIZER
Of course

She goes over to the tea things and pours a cup out for him

HARDY
Milk and four sugars please

The ORGANIZER stirs in the sugar takes the tea up to HARDY
and hands it to him

HARDY (contd)
Thank you so much
Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 170317

Well I think it’s amazing that you

stage) friendship and togetherness seated at the judge’s
table as a line up of BATHING BEAUTIES files past them
Slipping into stage ‘business’ with practised ease HARDY
does a lot of simpering and twiddling of his tie to the
GIRLS but when LAUREL does a goofy smile and waves to one of
them an ‘annoyed’ HARDY slaps him down Laughter - it all
seems to be going well

INT TENTED AREA - DAY 77

Late afternoon the sun starting to set LAUREL and HARDY are
to the side of the stage at the bottom of some steps out of
view of the audience - and once again ignoring each other On
stage PHOTOGRAPHERS snap away as the three beauty contest
FINALISTS parade for the crowd Eventually

LAUREL
I was talking to this fella about
eggs I know you’re interested in

eggs He said they get dried powder
to supplement the ration

(HARDY ignores him)
You get a packet a month same as
twelve eggs Doesn’t taste too
good but you can make omelettes
with it

(Still no answer)
That’s what he said

HARDY
I have nothing to say

LAUREL
Well I have nothing to say to you
either And you can forget what I
just said ‘cos I won’t be repeating

it

HARDY
Good

LAUREL
Good

LAUREL gets a nod from the ORGANIZER cutting the
conversation short A moment then he bounds up a few steps
onto the temporary stage HARDY goes to follow him but pauses
on the steps LAUREL takes the microphone to enthusiastic
APPLAUSE

LAUREL (contd)
Hello everybody Mr Hardy and I
would like to thank you for making
us feel so welcome today here in
Worthing one of my favourite
seaside towns

Applause He sees HARDY still on the steps

LAUREL (contd)
Dont forget we’re appearing next
week at the Lyceum

He looks to HARDY waiting for him to join him - but he
doesn’t move

LAUREL (contd)
Tickets still available

Weak laughter

LAUREL (contd)
Well all that remains is to crown
today’s lovely winner-

The ORGANIZER hands him an envelope then the winner’s tiara
LAUREL gives him back the envelope so he can take the tiara -
realises he doesn’t have the envelope so gives him the tiara

so he can take back the envelope All good business and he’s

getting laughs but still HARDY doesn’t join him

LAUREL (contd)
(Harsh whisper)
Will you quit sulkin’

But HARDY just doesn’t move LAUREL opens the envelope

LAUREL (contd)
And the winner is

The BAND strikes up a fanfare LAUREL looks to HARDY sure
that he will now grab the envelope from him and read out the
winner’s name himself But HARDY stares ahead glazed eyes
then sways and with a last anguished look to LAUREL loses
consciousness - for real He slumps down the steps and slides
to the ground below At first the crowd assumes it’s part of
the act and laughs - but when LAUREL jumps down off the stage
to tend his friend the mood becomes fearful and the music
stops A couple of REDCOATS push the crowd back

LAUREL (contd)
Give him some air - please

LAUREL helps HARDY into the recovery position

A taxi pulls up outside the hotel and the TAXI DRIVER hurries
round to help LAUREL get HARDY - who looks absolutely
terrible - from the back of the cab

INT SAVOY HOTEL LONDON - NIGHT 79

LAUREL and the TAXI DRIVER get HARDY inside

LAUREL
(To TAXI DRIVER)
Thank you so much I can take it
from here with the Bell Boys

Watched with great amusement by a couple of BELL BOYS LAUREL
goes to hand the TAXI DRIVER a half crown

LAUREL (contd)
Thank you so much this is for you

But he hands the TAXI DRIVER the money round the back of

HARDY whilst the TAXI DRIVER goes to receive it round the
front It’s entirely accidental and quickly corrected but
the BELL BOYS assume it’s a bit of impromptu entertainment

TAXI DRIVER
(Now taking the coin)
Thank you sir

The TAXI DRIVER leaves and LAUREL turns to the BELL BOYS

LAUREL
Could you help me get Mr Hardy up
to his room please he’s not
feeling too good

But the BELL BOYS think it’s a set up and just smile at him
HARDY almost falls and LAUREL has to grab him quickly to keep
him upright The BELL BOYS just laugh - assuming this is more
‘business’ LAUREL is getting desperate

LAUREL (contd)
I need some help here

The BELL BOYS look at each other - neither wanting to be the
butt of what they assume will be a prank One of them wiggles
his tie at them ‘Hardy-style’ waiting to be entertained

LAUREL (contd)
No I really
Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 220217 79

But exasperated he sees they are not going to help him And
so - alone - LAUREL is forced to stagger across the foyer to
the elevators using all his strength to keep HARDY upright
As the elevator doors open and LAUREL eases HARDY inside the
BELL BOYS still think something’s going to happen LAUREL
pokes his head out before the doors shut

LAUREL (contd)
I really did need some help you
know

And the BELL BOYS fall about laughing He pulls his head back
in and the doors shut

The seriousness of Hardy’s condition and the poignancy of
LAUREL having to help his friend all by himself is brought
home as we see LAUREL struggling desperately to get a semi-
conscious HARDY back to his hotel room inching painfully
along the corridor a step at a time until finally he

manages to knock on his door LUCILLE - in her dressing gown -
opens it sees the state HARDY is in and blanches

could

from his ears and folds it up

Mr Hardy I believe you’ve suffered
a mild heart attack today I also
believe that there is some evidence
of congestive failure

Oh dear God I knew it-

If you won’t admit yourself to

home as soon as you possibly can to
seek specialist treatment in the

Of course not of course not

He cuts off a strategic slice of smoked salmon wolfs it
down A few moment’s silence then DELFONT ‘casually’ changes
tack

DELFONT (cont’d)
Stanley am I right in thinking that
before you teamed up with Oliver
you worked with other partners

LAUREL
Well I had lots of different
partners in Vaudeville yes I once
worked with Charlie Chaplin but

DELFONT
And of course Oliver made his
elephant film with a different
partner

LAUREL
What’s that got to do with
anything

DELFONT
Oh I don’t know random thought -
there’s a very popular double act
here called Cook and Baker I know
them very well Cook is the Hardy
to Baker’s Laurel if you see what
I mean
(Takes a sip of orange
juice)

I was just wondering whether you
might not consider trying a couple
of shows with Nobby Cook just to
keep things going until Babe can
return

No no Silly idea

He pulls two boiled eggs from his pocket and holds them out

HARDY
Eggs

It looks like Laurel is echoing the moment on stage when he
visits Hardy in hospital - but he’s perfectly serious

LAUREL
I went down to the kitchen to see
if they could spare any Cost me
three shillings each

HARDY takes them delighted

HARDY
I‘1l have one now if I may

He starts to peel the shell off one straight away sees
LAUREL looking enviously at the other one

HARDY (contd)
Go ahead

LAUREL needs no further encouragement and takes the other
egg also starting to peel it

LAUREL
I’1l get you some more

The two men peel the shell off their eggs contentedly

Where’s Lucille gone She could
have stayed it was just a silly
row about nothing the other day
Just nothing

LAUREL falls silent cut off in mid-sentence

HARDY
The doctor’s told me I can’t go on
with the tour and I’ve promised
Lucille I won’t

LAUREL stares at him - no words will come out

HARDY (cont’d)
So I’m retiring Stan I’ve promised
Lucille and that’s all there is to
it I’m sorry

LAUREL
I should never have made us take
this tour

HARDY
Je ne regret rien And you
shouldn’t regret rien either

LAUREL
Can’t you rest and then we can
start again when you’re better

(Shakes his head)
He’s told me my heart won’t stand
it I’m going back home as soon as
we can arrange a crossing

A long beat HARDY can see LAUREL’S finding this so
difficult Both of them hold their half-finished eggs

LAUREL
Youre retiring

Yes Retiring

HARDY looks at his friend his head down clearly devastated

HARDY (contd)
I know how much this tour and
doing the picture meant to you

It’s like he has to say it out loud again as if this will
somehow change things HARDY can see he’s in distress

HARDY
What new scenes for the movie have
you been working on

Oh nothing really

meets his gaze

HARDY
Now aren’t you ashamed of yourself

What

HARDY
Lying to me your oldest and
dearest friend here on my sickbed

LAUREL
I don’t know what you mean

HARDY
I haven’t seen you for two days
and you’re trying to tell me you
havent been working on any new
material in that time

A beat then LAUREL has to smile

HARDY (contd)
Come on then out with it

LAUREL
(Long beat)
I did think of this romantic scene
Youre pining for Maid Marian who
has been holed up in the castle by
the Sheriff of Nottingham-

LAUREL even feels sufficiently cheered to take another bite
of his egg Through a mouthful he continues

LAUREL (contd)
-so we hear this sad violin music

HARDY starts to hum some sad sweet tune to LAUREL
LAUREL (contd)

And it’s all too much for you and
you begin to cry
Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 220217 86

HARDY starts to look upset as he hums wiping away a ‘tear’

LAUREL (contd)
And the tears begin to fall And
they fall pretty heavy splashing
down your cheeks but I’m not
upset one bit and I don’t know what
to do but you’re crying so much
so what I do is move a pot plant
under you to catch them so the
plant gets a good watering and it
starts to grow like crazy

HARDY slaps his thigh and laughs LAUREL is thrilled

HARDY
The props guys can fix me up so the
tears are like two little
waterfalls - it’ll be a riot
That’s great Stan that’1l go big

As he laughs HARDY is gripped by another coughing fit LAUREL
quickly hands him a glass of water but HARDY has to find his
breath first before he takes a sip he slumps back against
his pillow exhausted

HARDY (contd)
Can you get me another blanket I
feel so cold

LAUREL grabs another blanket and throws it over him

LAUREL
Your hands are like ice

He gets under the blanket with him to warm him up lying
right next to him - just like they did in their films

LAUREL (contd)
There is that better

The two men lie together happily side by side each
envisaging the ‘pot plant’ scene - but knowing they’1l never
get to perform it A beat then

HARDY
Have you spoken to Delfont

LAUREL
Yeh I saw him this morning

They are both gazing up at the ceiling rather than at each
other as they talk

HARDY
What’d he say
Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 170317 87

LAUREL
Well he didn’t know you were
retiring of course but he asked me
since you were sick how I felt
about carrying on the show with
somebody else

HARDY
Who

LAUREL
English comedian called Nobby
Cook

HARDY

That makes sense

LAUREL
I haven’t said I would yet

HARDY turns to LAUREL
HARDY
Why not You didn’t get sick
(Beat)
It’s for the best Stan

LAUREL
Yes Maybe it is

LAUREL is standing next to him as ‘Stanley-A-Dale’ with a
feather in his hat Again it’s the ‘Robin Hood’ movie that
didn’t happen brought to life in Laurel’s imagination

ROBIN HOOD
And what pray tell has Robin Hood
done to inspire such wrath

HARDY
Well we’ve heard that he steals
from the poor to give to the rich
isn’t that right Stanley

LAUREL
Isn’t that stupid That’s just
robbing Peter to pay Paul - he’s
got the whole thing the wrong way
round

HARDY
Exactly Our idea you see is to
give to the poor by stealing from
the poor And thereby cutting out
the middle man

LAUREL
The rich need never be any the
wiser

HARDY

Precisely So if you’d please
stand aside we have important
business afoot

HARDY steps forward but ROBIN HOOD bars the way with his
staff jabbing him in the belly with it They look at each
other sizing things up

because of this and punches him in the throat - making his
tongue come out LAUREL retaliates by punching HARDY on the
nose HARDY howls with pain they get into a shoving match
and HARDY ends up in the river

He sits in the water spits some out of his mouth wipes his
eyes There’s some heavy flapping from inside his cassock and
he wriggles around until he pulls out a huge salmon and
throws it away He LOOKS TO CAMERA full of utter frustration
with what he has to put up with then he looks up at LAUREL

the orchestra stops and the THEATRE MANAGER walks out on
stage into a spotlight

THEATRE MANAGER
Ladies and gentlemen I’m afraid
due to circumstances beyond our
control tonight’s performance has
been cancelled

A large murmur of discontent DELFONT looks around at the
full house in despair

DELFONT
Cancelled

IDA realizes straight away what has happened

IDA

IDA enters the bar She sees LAUREL by himself a tumbler of
Scotch in front of him smoking a cigarette She goes over to
him sits down next to him
Stan and Ollie - Green Revisions 110417 93

She gently takes his cigarette and stubs it out and as
before takes his Scotch and drinks it to stop him drinking
it

LAUREL

(Beat)
When you watch our movies nobody
else in the stories knows us And
we don’t know anybody either It
was just the two of us the only
thing we had was each other And
that was the way we wanted it

(Beat looks at her)
I love him Ida

IDA looks at him and gently smiles She nods accepts his
decision

IDA
We go home

LAUREL nods

LAUREL
Don’t tell Babe Tell him I’m going
to continue with the dates in
Ireland it’d upset him to think
of me cancelling the tour
(Beat)
I’m sorry my darling

103 INT HARDY’S SAVOY HOTEL ROOM - DAY 103

LUCILLE brushes her hair in front of a mirror as she chats
away to HARDY who stares ahead thoughtfully

LUCILLE
- the doctor thinks you should be
well enough to travel tomorrow
which is wonderful Now I’m going
to go down and see if there’s any
mail and then the Laurels will be
stopping by to say goodbye - I do
hope it’s not going to rain today
when that wind gets up the chill
cuts right through to the bone

Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 170317 94

She stands up final check of her appearance in the mirror-

LUCILLE (cont’d)
I won’t be long papa

She kisses him on the forehead and leaves HARDY lost in his
thoughts doesn’t say a word

INT LAUREL’S SAVOY HOTEL ROOM - DAY 104

LAUREL sits in a chair three packed suitcases nearby ready

to go downstairs He concentrates gloomily on the door as IDA
flits about picking up the last few bits from the room Soon
when the Bell Boy comes through that door it’1ll all be over

IDA
You have money for Bell Boy

LAUREL nods He looks at the door There’s a knock

IDA (contd)
Answer please I need bathroom You
give him five shillings only No
more

As IDA disappears into the bathroom LAUREL hauls himself up
with a sigh fumbles through his pockets for change and opens
the door to find a fully dressed HARDY standing outside
He’s pale and a little unsteady on his feet but his eyes are
clear and his expression determined LAUREL looks at him
speechless

INT HARDY’S SAVOY HOTEL ROOM - DAY 105

LUCILLE lets herself in

LUCILLE
One of the Bell Boys down there
Raymond I think his name was said
to tell you he had a good tip for
you on a horse

She walks through to the bedroom
LUCILLE (cont’d)
Have you been gambling Oliver
Hardy

She sees the empty bed Hardy’s crumpled pyjamas on it And
instantly she knows what has happened

INT LAUREL’S SAVOY HOTEL ROOM - DAY 106

LAUREL and HARDY face each other over the doorstep Finally
HARDY speaks
Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 170317 940A

HARDY
Come Stanley I believe we have
some engagements to fulfil

Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 220217 95

On LAUREL a long beat Then he understands what this means
He and HARDY don’t need to say any more they just look at
each other

INT HARDY’S SAVOY HOTEL ROOM - DAY 107

LUCILLE sits on the bed upset but not angry Deep down she
knew this was inevitable

EXT DECK STEAMER - DAY 108

The sun shines in a clear bright sky but it’s bracing up on
deck HARDY is lying on a deck lounger wrapped in a blanket
LUCILLE next to him IDA and LAUREL (wearing his beret) walk
back to them from a trip around deck

LUCILLE
I think we should all get below
now out of this wind

IDA
Dahling I agree

LUCILLE
Oliver Will you at least listen to
me about this Or are you
determined to catch pneumonia

HARDY
I’m enjoying the fresh air honey
Stan come and sit with me - you
girls go ahead

LUCILLE hesitates for a moment not happy

LAUREL
I’1l bring him down

She nods gives LAUREL a smile Then she and IDA depart
LAUREL takes a beret from his pocket and hands it to HARDY

LAUREL (contd)
Here Thought you might want this
back

HARDY looks at him smiles takes back the beret he threw at
Laurel during their big argument and pulls it on his head

HARDY
Thanks

LAUREL sits down next to him takes a pair of gloves from his
pocket and pulls them on finger by finger carefully making
sure each one is pulled on tight HARDY watches with
increasing exasperation Then finally

LAUREL
Babe I lied to you
Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 170317 96

HARDY
(Stern expression)
What do you mean

LAUREL

There is no movie

(Beat)
Miffin told me a couple of weeks
ago it had fallen through I
guess nobody wants a Laurel and
Hardy picture any more

(A few moments as this

sinks in)
But if I’d told you straight
away well maybe we could have

finished the tour early and you
wouldn’t have got sick

HARDY
(Beat)
You knew two weeks ago that there
was no movie

LAUREL
Yes And I been feelin’ terrible
about it
On HARDY a long beat Then

HARDY
Stan I knew

LAUREL
What

HARDY
I knew

LAUREL

Why didn’t you tell me you knew

HARDY
I thought you already knew I knew

LAUREL
How could I know that you knew I
already knew

HARDY
(Flounders for a moment)
What’s the next line

LAUREL
‘I thought you already knew I knew
but you were pretending you didn’t
know I knew’
Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 240317 96A

HARDY
Thank you

LAUREL
So if you knew why did you let me
keep rehearsing the movie with you

HARDY
What else are we gonna do

Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 170317 97

They exchange a smile HARDY pulls his coat up around his
neck against the cold

EXT COBH HARBOUR - DAY 109

Caption
Cobh harbour Ireland

The steamer heads into Cobh harbour an old seaport on the
southern coast of Ireland dominated by St Coleman’s
Cathedral towering over the quay from its hillside perch

We see feet small feet - some with no socks just in clogs -
running We see CHILDREN emerging from street corners to make
their way down to the quayside - where a crowd is gathering

EXT STEAMER DECK - DAY 110

The LAURELS and HARDYS make their way up out of the ship’s
interior on to the gangplank LAUREL with two big cases and
HARDY just a small valise (their old trick whenever they
arrive somewhere) But they stop as they look out at the
quayside We now

CUT TO

-what they see a huge crowd of people of all ages has
gathered to greet them standing patiently silently IDA and
LUCILLE drop back so that LAUREL and HARDY can walk down the
gangplank together Once the crowd sees them the big guy and
the little guy from the movies a great cheer erupts As they
descend the gangplank hats are thrown in the air and the
crowd surges forward to greet them Then just as they reach
the bottom of the gangplank something extraordinary happens
From the cathedral bells at the top of the hill ‘The Dance
Of The Cuckoos’ - the boys’ theme tune - is rung out from the
bell tower LAUREL and HARDY look at each other unable to
quite believe what is happening They both weep openly
amazed at the reception at the warmth and love which engulfs
them

A full house all ages the audience impatient to see their

together a small sign of how nervous he is Of how much
deep down he really does care about the boys

INT WINGS OLYMPIA THEATRE DUBLIN - NIGHT 113

HARDY is having his leg hoisted up in ‘traction’ LAUREL

hospital room set HARDY in bed leg in plaster Applause
LAUREL enters stage left with the bunch of flowers and paper
bag and at the sight of the two men together there is renewed
applause whistles and even cheers LAUREL waits for it to
die down

LAUREL
Hi Ollie how are you

HARDY
Never mind how I am - what took you
so long to get here

LAUREL
Well they said no visitors so I
said I was your son and it worked
like a charm

HARDY
My son You have a lot of nerve
telling them I was your father

LAUREL
I couldn’t tell them you were my
mother

HARDY

Of course you couldn’t I’ve never
even been married

Big laughs - the audience are loving it

HARDY
What have you got there

LAUREL
I brought you some hard boiled eggs
and some nuts

HARDY looks to the audience exasperated and they laugh
Stan and Ollie - Yellow Revisions 310317 98A

HARDY
Now you know I cant eat hard
boiled eggs and nuts If you wanted
to bring me something why didnt
you bring me a box of candy

LAUREL
Well they cost too much

HARDY
What has that got to do with it

LAUREL
And you didnt pay me for the last
box I brought you

Laughter LAUREL offers HARDY the bag

LAUREL
Have one

HARDY
No I’d rather not
(To the audience with
disgust)
Hard boiled eggs and nuts

LAUREL ignores him takes an egg out and starts to peel it
and eat it HARDY watches incredulous as Laurel pulls a
salt cellar from his pocket and sprinkles some on

We see DELFONT smiling at what he sees on stage but as ever
twisting his head round to make a quick mental calculation on
the size of the house Business is business
Stan and Ollie - Yellow Revisions 310317 99
We see LUCILLE next to IDA LUCILLE is worried but trying
to smile through it IDA seems calm
DELETED 115

INT OLYMPIA THEATRE DUBLIN - NIGHT 116

The double door routine HARDY sweaty but still on his feet
his and LAUREL’S timing slick as ever as one goes in one
door the other emerges through another

INT BACKSTAGE OLYMPIA THEATRE DUBLIN - NIGHT 117

LAUREL and HARDY helped by their DRESSERS hurriedly change
into their battered suits and Bowlers for the finale Outside
there is clapping cheering and whistling As they wait in
the wings ready to go on LAUREL is concerned with how
exhausted HARDY looks - drenched in sweat breathless from
the effort he’s put in already struggling to even get on his
jacket

LAUREL
You look tired out Babe - why don’t
we just go out and say goodnight
and finish it there We don’t have
to do the song

HARDY
I’m fine
(Sudden thought)

Listen I had this idea for the
picture How about I grab Robin
Hood’s staff and go to hit you with
that but instead I knock down this
bees’ nest and it lands on my head

LAUREL
(Smiles)
That’s a swell idea That’1ll go
big

The ‘Dance Of The Cuckoos’ strikes up out front and the

curtain starts to open

HARDY
It was fun while it lasted wasn’t
it Stan
Stan and Ollie - Pink Revisions 170317 99A
LAUREL smiles then waits for his cue On that same note he
walks out - only to be hooked back by HARDY-

HARDY (contd)
I’1l miss us when we’re gone

LAUREL
So will you

Now HARDY walks out on stage and LAUREL kicks him up the ass
as he goes
Stan and Ollie - Yellow Revisions 310317 100

118 INT OLYMPIA THEATRE DUBLIN - NIGHT 118

HARDY and then LAUREL walk on together to a storm of clapping
and cheering they wait patiently for it to die down

HARDY
Ladies and gentlemen we hope you’ve
enjoyed our bit of fun tonight
we’ve sure enjoyed ourselves
haven’t we Stanley

LAUREL
We certainly have

HARDY
We’ll never forget the warm welcome
weve received here in Dublin

LAUREL
Not just Dublin but the whole of
Scotland

HARDY

Dublin isn’t in Scotland

LAUREL
(thinking)
I was wondering why we got on that
boat
(realising whispering to
HARDY )
We must be in Ireland

HARDY
(sarcastically)
We must be in Ireland

Another burst of applause

HARDY
We’d like to finish tonight with a
little dance

HARDY and LAUREL share a look

HARDY
From our film ‘Way Out West’
Maestro Stanley

Then just as LUCILLE looks like she’s about to pass out with
worry she feels IDA’S hand reaching for hers She’s shocked
She turns to her and IDA smiles LUCILLE smiles back and
squeezes IDA’S hand warmly grateful that she’s there to
support her at this moment They both turn back to the stage
still holding hands
Stan and Ollie - Yellow Revisions 310317 100aaA

On stage HARDY in that very proper way of his extends a
hand which is taken by LAUREL - and now they are also holding
hands They bow to the audience then wait for the music cue
Stan and Ollie - Blue Revisions 240317 100aA

As the orchestra starts ‘At The Ball That’s All’ the BOYS
tap their feet then begin their dance routine once again -
and we are transported back to the magic of ‘Way Out West’
In spite of HARDY’S physical problems and illness his light
footedness is as exquisite as ever And although both men are
now looking old their grace and elegance defies their years
LAUREL matches HARDY every step of the way the two dancing
together like the loving couple they most surely are

We finish behind LAUREL and HARDY silhouetted against the
lights looking out at the audience As they come together
and hold each other’s hands we FREEZE

Laurel and Hardy returned to America after the tour but they
never performed together again Hardy’s health went into
decline and after a long illness he died in August 1957
Stan and Ollie - Locked White Shooting Script 220217 101

Laurel refused all offers to perform without his old partner
and went into retirement But he continued writing comedy
material for Laurel and Hardy right up until his death in
February 1965
