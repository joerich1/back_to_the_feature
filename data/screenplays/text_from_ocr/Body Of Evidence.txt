BODY OF EVIDENCE

by Brad Mirman (second draft)

Over the BLACK we hear the SOUNDS of two people making love A
MANS VOICE MOANS passionately

FADE IN

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

ANDREW MARSH lies on his back in bed He is a frail-looking
man in his early sixties with thinning gray hair On top of
him is a much younger WOMAN Although her back is to us we
catch flashes of her face for a moment as she turns from side
to side We see enough to know that this is a beautiful woman

She moves wildly grinding her hips into him her head arched
back her hands rubbing lightly over her breasts She reaches
down grabbing his hips and jerks them upwards forcing him
deeper inside her They move together -- faster -- and faster

The CAMERA slowly begins to PULL BACK As it does we see what
we are watching is on a TELEVISION

Further back still We see TWO UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS
standing before the television watching the act

The CAMERA begins to pan around the room Rain streaks down
the windows of the room -- LIGHTNING flashes outside A VIDEO
CAMERA is set up on a tripod More PLAIN CLOTHES POLICE
looking dusting talking

We continue to PAN We can now see it is the same room on the
tape ON the bed lies the naked body of ANDREW MARSH a sheet
covering his lower torso His face is ashen mouth open his
dull eyes looking out in a fixed stare The last instant of
his life is etched upon a face frozen in pain

EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

LIGHTNING fills the night sky THUNDER BOOMS overhead The
wind whips the RAIN furiously against anything in its path
The CAMERA moves slowly along rows of beautiful HOMES At the
end is a cul-de-sac Several POLICE CARS are in the driveway
their RED LIGHTS FLASHING
A four-door SEDAN pulls into the driveway JOHN CARDENAS steps
out into the rain He is a handsome Latin in his thirties
with hard chiseled features and black slicked-backed hair

He does not run through the rain -- he walks

DETECTIVE REESE a man who looks more like an accountant than a
homicide detective runs out to meet him

CARDENAS
Is it Marsh
REESE
Yeah
Just a hint of sadness shows on Cardenas face It lasts an

instant then its gone
REESE
Sir do you mind if we get out of the
rain

Cardenas doesnt move He ignores the question

CARDENAS
Who found him

REESE
His Secretary Joanne Braslow

CARDENAS
She was here

REESE
No She stopped by to pick up some
papers

CARDENAS
Show me

Reese starts for the house Cardenas looks up into the night
sky A FLASH of LIGHTNING fills the SCREEN

INT HOUSE BEDROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA - NIGHT

Pull back to reveal a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER snapping pictures of
Marsh in bed
Cardenas enters followed by Reese He moves through the
FORENSIC and MEDICAL TEAMS Anything Cardenas feels about the
gruesome sight before him is hidden behind a mask of
indifference

Standing by the bed is ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY ROGER
TROXELL a short baby-faced man Cardenas looks down at the
body then over at the MEDICAL EXAMINER DR HENRY McCURDY a
portly man with windblown cheeks and bloodshot eyes

CARDENAS
How long

MCCURDY
About three hours

CARDENAS
Cause

MCCURDY
Not sure Ill have everything you
need tomorrow

REESE
Take a look at this

Reese points to the nightstand drawer and Troxell opens it On
top of the nightstand is a box of tissues and a bottle of nasal
spray Inside are ROPES HANDCUFFS and an assortment of SEXUAL
AIDES

TROXELL
This guy was into some kinky shit

Cardenas looks at the various sexual devices then walks out of
the room

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

JOANNE BRASLOW sits on chair Her eyes are tired -- red from
crying She is mid thirties -- attractive but her looks come
more from effort than nature -- expensive hair cut -- the right
cosmetics She has a corporate look to her

Cardenas steps into the hall and walks over to her

CARDENAS
Miss Braslow -- Im District Attorney
John Cardenas You arrived at what
time tonight
JOANNE
A little after eleven

CARDENAS
Why did you come by

JOANNE
I had some papers to pick up

CARDENAS
Do you know who Mr Marsh was with

JOANNE
I assume his girlfriend

CARDENAS
Her name

JOANNE
Rebecca Lawson

CARDENAS
You wouldnt know her address would
you
JOANNE
No -- but I can get it for you
CARDENAS
Thank you

INT HALLWAY CITY HALL BUILDING - DAY

Cardenas walks down the corridor with McCurdy

MCCURDY
Marsh wasnt alone We found traces
of sperm on the sheets The

toxicology report says there were
high levels of cocaine in his blood

CARDENAS
Whatd he die of

MCCURDY
The official cause of death was a
cardiac arrest

CARDENAS
The official cause

MCCURDY
Thats what my report will read

CARDENAS
But theres more

They reach a door and stop

MCCURDY
Its speculative at this point
Marsh had advanced Arterial disease
His heart attack was induced by
excessive aerobic activity -- in
conjunction with the drug

McCurdy enters the room Cardenas thinks for a moment then
follows

INT CARDENAS OFFICE - DAY
Spacious and sparsely furnished The walls are empty No
commendations plaques or photographs to add prestige to the
office Cardenas steps into the room and looks at McCurdy
who
is already seated next to Reese and Troxell
CARDENAS
(to McCurdy)
What are you saying Henry That his
girlfriend fucked him to death
MCCURDY
Yes
A trace of a grin shows on Cardenas face He walks over to
the window and stares outside Reese Troxell and McCurdy
wait

as he thinks A beat Cardenas turns back to the room

CARDENAS
What can we prove
MCCURDY

We know Marsh had a head cold We
found cocaine mixed with water ina
nasal spray container on the
nightstand The coke would contract
the nasal membrane the same as any
decongestant but for a much shorter
time Hed keep using more and more
-- never knowing what he was taking

CARDENAS
Any prints on the nasal spray

REESE
Marshs and Rebecca Lawsons

TROXELL
What if he did know what was in it
A lot of users put it in nasal spray
bottles so they can use it in public

MCCURDY
Cocaine is the last thing a man in
his condition would want

CARDENAS
Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the
scene

REESE

A man across the street from Marsh
saw her drive up about four thirty
Sunday afternoon And her prints are
all over the place

Cardenas stands and walks to a DART BOARD on the wall
gathers the DARTS moves back and tosses one

TROXELL
Marshs Cardiologist told me that
after Marsh was diagnosed with heart
disease he quit smoking quit
drinking and started exercising every
day Does that sound like a guy
whod start shoveling cocaine up his
nose

CARDENAS
What did he say about Miss Lawson

TROXELL
He can remember at least one occasion
-- and the receptionist can recall
two times when she accompanied Marsh
to the office

Cardenas throws another dart at the board

CARDENAS
So she knew about his heart

TROXELL
Had to I also interviewed three
women who were in past relationships
with Marsh Theres no evidence that
he had anything but straight sex
prior to meeting Miss Lawson

CARDENAS
What about the will

TROXELL
Thats the best part She gets it
all -- everything

EXT CEMETERY - MORNING

Gray clouds hang over head A light drizzle falls A GROUP

of
MOURNERS hold umbrellas as they stand around the grave
In the bg the PRESS is visible held back my private
SECURITY
GUARDS

A WOMAN dressed in BLACK stands in the front of the MOUNERS
her face hidden behind a hat and veil RAYMOND SATTLER a
tall distinguished-looking man in his sixties stands beside
her He supports his weight with the aid of a CANE The
service concludes Sattler along with several other PEOPLE
offer her their condolences Joanne Braslow is there She
does not go over to Rebecca

CARDENAS AND REESE stand off to the side by a large oak

Cardenas watches and waits He steps forward as Sattler
the woman by

CARDENAS
Miss Lawson

The Woman stops Her back is to Cardenas

CARDENAS
Im District Attorney John Cardenas

REBECCA LAWSON removes her hat and veil and slowly turns
around She is in her late twenties A deep pain fills her
face -- controlled but evident Her eyes are tired --

from crying -- but no tears show now This is a woman whose
grief is private and not displayed for others Although
emotionally drained she is still stunningly beautiful So
beautiful that even Cardenas usually cool demeanor cannot

how impressed he is

SATTLER
I dont think that this is the time
or the place

CARDENAS
I just wanted to introduce myself and
inform Miss Lawson that there will be
an inquiry

SATTLER
An inquiry into what

CARDENAS
For starters Id like to know why she
left the house and didnt report the
death

SATTLER
Because he wasnt dead when she left
and even if he was not reporting a
natural death in a timely fashion
isnt a crime

CARDENAS
Did I say it was a natural death
walks

DULANEY

mid-

early

Cardenas and Rebecca lock eyes Rebecca stares at him
genuinely shocked by his accusation Cardenas nods and

away In the bg we see Joanne staring at Rebecca with
hostility

INT HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Large and homey A fire roars in the fireplace FRANK
sits on his couch as he goes over some PAPERWORK He is
thirties powerful self-assured

SHARON DULANEY enters She is an attractive woman in her

thirties She kisses him on the cheek then pushes his
PAPERWORK aside and sits down on his lap

SHARON

SHARON
(pushing the papers
aside)
This is not relaxing

DULANEY
(playfully)
Really
SHARON

DULANEY

(playing along)
And I suppose youre going to show me
how to relax

SHARON
If you want me to

DULANEY
Im always open to learning new
things
She kisses him -- soft gentle kisses Dulaney puts his

arms
around her and kisses her harder
DULANEY
Im beginning to see what you mean
Why dont we go upstairs and work on
the advanced course

SHARON
I cant Ive got to finish a
counter offer on the Bergman
property
The moment is passing by A trace of frustration shows on
Dulaneys face -- this is obviously not a new occurrence
DULANEY
Cant it wait
SHARON
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow
The moment is gone Dulaney forces an understanding smile
He

looks towards the door and sees his EIGHT YEAR OLD SON
MICHAEL

DULANEY
Hey Slugger Ready for bed

Michael walks over to this parents

MICHAEL
Uh huh

The PHONE RINGS Dulaney answers it

DULANEY

(into phone)

DAs going to file on Rebecca
Lawson He wants me in the office

SHARON

DULANEY
I know What can I do He is the
boss

SHARON

He could let you have your vacation

MICHAEL
Dad -- is it true what theyre saying
about that Miss Lawson Lady

DULANEY
What are they saying
MICHAEL
The kids at school say she humped Mr
Marsh to death
DULANEY
Hey you know better than that What
did I teach you to say when someone
is accused of doing something
MICHAEL
She allegedly humped him to death
Dulaney grins Sharon is fighting the temptation to laugh
SHARON
I swear -- the both of you
(to Dulaney)
Some example you set
DULANEY
(imitating her)
Some example you set
He makes a funny face at Michael who LAUGHS and makes one
back

Dulaney grabs him and starts TICKLING him Michael SCREAMS

with LAUGHTER as he tries to tickle him back Dulaney then

starts TICKLING SHARON -- Michael helps him Sharon ROARS
with
around

sits

LAUGHTER and falls to the floor The three of them roll

LAUGHING hysterically

INT SATTLERS OFFICE - MORNING

Sattler sits on a couch sipping a cup of coffee

across from him

DULANEY
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man
A trial like this is going to put
Cardenas in the spot-light

SATTLER
Weve already got press arriving from
over the country and she hasnt even
been charged yet
Cardenas wants to see her in his
office tomorrow at ten Id like you
to go with her

DULANEY
Im supposed to be on vacation

SATTLER
I know -- but she wants you to
represent her if Cardenas files

DULANEY
Why

SATTLER
Because I told her you were the best
criminal attorney we have

DULANEY
Raymond Im the only criminal
attorney you have

SATTLER
(jokingly)
Well I guess that makes you the
best
(candidly)

Look Frank -- she stands to inherit

Dulaney
three million dollars As executors
of the estate and her attorneys that
could generate a lot of legal fees
for us All Im asking you to do is
talk to her

Dulaney thinks about it for a moment

DULANEY
Alright Ill talk to her

SATTLER
Shes waiting in the conference room

Dulaney stands and walks towards the door

SATTLER
(continuing)
You know I knew Andrew Marsh for
almost twenty years -- or thought I

did What do you think would make a
man in his condition do the things he
did

Dulaney stops at the door and looks back

DULANEY
I think the question is What is it
about her that made him want to do
it

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Rebecca is seated at the end of the conference table smoking
° CIGARETTE Sunlight flows through a window and highlights
her

hair She is dressed in a fashionable business suit that
clings to every curve of her body

Dulaney enters the room When he sees her he cant help but
stare Rebecca notes his gaze

DULANEY
Miss Lawson Im Frank Dulaney
She raises the cigarette to her lips Dulaney notices
despite
her outward composure her hand is shaking

REBECCA
(nervously)
Are you going to represent me

DULANEY
There are no charges against you Im
here to decide if Im going to
represent you should that occur
(beat)
Did you kill him

Rebecca appears hurt by the question

REBECCA
You dont waste any time do you

Dulaney doesnt answer He studies her -- his eyes probing
hers

REBECCA
(continuing)
Do you think I did it

DULANEY
I dont know Thats why Im asking
you

REBECCA
You must have some feeling Some
immediate impression A young
attractive woman involved with an
older man who leaves her everything
in his will And the things that
went on in that house Such wild
sex What kind of picture does that
paint

DULANEY
Not a very good one Im afraid

REBECCA
And thats exactly what the jury will
see when they look at me Thats why
I need a very good lawyer Mr
Dulaney

DULANEY
Youre assuming the District Attorney
is going to file charges

Rebeccas anxiety begins to surface She feigns a weak
smile

REBECCA
Hell file Hes an ambitious man
Ambitious men build their careers on
the bodies of others

DULANEY
You still havent answered my
question

She takes a long drag of her cigarette before answering

She
looks at Dulaney Displaying emotions is not something that
comes easily Tears well up in her eyes

REBECCA

(emotionally)
I loved him A big part of my life
has been torn away from me Mr
Dulaney A part I can never get back
-- and on top of that people are
saying that I am somehow responsible
for it Theyve taken everything
that is good and caring about two
people in love and made it dirty

A single tear streams down her check She knows what he
wants
to hear her say -- and she resents having to say it

REBECCA
No -- I didnt kill him

INT HALLWAY DAS OFFICE - DAY

Cardenas walks down the hall sipping a cup of coffee
Troxell
walks towards him excitedly They walk together

TROXELL
I think Im going to make your day

CARDENAS
How

Troxell points to an Office Through the glass partition we

can see a MAN sitting at a table ALAN PALEY is a well-
groomed

man in his thirties who makes every effort to look good

TROXELL
Ive got this guy in my office
Doctor Alan Paley Wait until you
hear what he has to say

Cardenas and Troxell enters the room Cardenas shakes hands
with Paley and listens with great interest as he starts to
talk

INT DULANEYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dulaney and Sharon are in bed Dulaney reads some PAPERS
Sharon finishes reading her MAGAZINE She puts it on the
nightstand and looks at Dulaney

SHARON
How can Cardenas possibly think he
can build a case against two
consenting adults

DULANEY
He must have something or he wouldnt
be pressing so hard

SHARON
If he files are you going to take the
case

DULANEY

I dont know yet I want to hear
what she says at her statement
tomorrow

SHARON
Whats she like

DULANEY
Attractive Bright Distant
Charming when she wants to be
Dulaneys description seems to bother her

SHARON
She sounds like quite a woman

DULANEY
(joking)

Yeah -- but can she cook

Sharon hits him on the arm playfully

SHARON
The whole thing gives me the creeps
I mean -- what if she really humped
him to death
Dulaney grins at her choice of words
DULANEY
Humped
SHARON
(grinning)
Yes
DULANEY
I can think of worse ways to go--
Dulaney rolls over gathering her up in his arms
DULANEY
(continuing)
--and speaking of humping
He reaches over to the nightstand and turns off the LIGHTS
EXT CITY HALL BUILDING MORNING
As Dulaney and Rebecca walks up the steps they are engulfed
by
a CROWD of REPORTERS Dulaney puts his arm around Rebecca
and

ushers her through the crowd

INT CARDENAS OFFICE - MORNING
stands

Dulaney and Rebecca sit on one side of a table

Cardenas sits at his desk

REBECCA
I didnt know that Andrew was dead
until Mr Sattler called me at home
that night

REESE
We have a witness who saw you go into
the house at four thirty

DULANEY
Shes not denying she was there

REESE
Did you have sex

REBECCA
Yes

REESE
What time did you leave

REBECCA
Six thirty -- and he was very much
alive

CARDENAS

Miss Lawson do you use cocaine

REBECCA
I have

CARDENAS
Did you use it the night Marsh died

REBECCA
No I havent done it in years

REESE
Did Marsh use it

REBECCA
No -- never

REESE

Reese

Dulaneys

It had to get there somehow

REBECCA
It didnt get there from me

CARDENAS
Were you aware of Mr Marshs heart
condition

REBECCA
No

CARDENAS
Mr Marshs Cardiologist and his
nurse have told us that you
accompanied Mr Marsh to their office
on at least two occasions

REBECCA
Thats correct -- but Andrew never
told me he had a heart condition He
said he had a heart arrhythmia and it
was nothing serious

REESE
He never mentioned his heart disease

DULANEY
She just said that

REESE
Why do you think he lied to you

DULANEY
Thats something only Marsh would
know

REESE
I think Miss Lawson knew it too I
think she slipped him the coke and he
popped his cork giving her the high-
hard-one

anger shows He stands
DULANEY

Thats it My client doesnt have to
take this crap from you
his

removes

She

CARDENAS
Sit down Frank

DULANEY
No Miss Lawson came in here
voluntarily to answer your questions
She doesnt have to sit here and be
insulted So either you charge her
now or were leaving

A beat Dulaney and Cardenas lock eyes Cardenas shrugs
shoulders

CARDENAS
Fine

Dulaney motions for Rebecca to get up She stands and they
walk to the door Reese looks at Cardenas Cardenas nods

REESE
Rebecca Lawson youre under arrest
for the murder of Andrew Marsh

Rebecca is stunned -- frightened She looks at Dulaney in
disbelief Dulaney looks at Cardenas angrily Reese

his handcuffs as he moves towards Rebecca
REESE

You have the right to remain silent
If you give up--

CARDENAS
(to Reese)
I dont think the handcuffs will be
necessary You can finish giving

Miss Lawson her rights outside
Reese grabs Rebecca by the arm and leads her to the door

looks back at Frank her face filled with fear -- her eyes
welling with tears

REBECCA
(frightened)
Frank
DULANEY
Ill have you out in a few hours

Reese ushers her through the door A beat Dulaney and
Cardenas are left alone Cardenas starts fishing through a

can
of NUTS carefully extracting the cashews Dulaney
continues
to stand
DULANEY
Lookin to make the papers John
CARDENAS
Marsh left her close to three million
dollars in his will Thats motive
She admits to being there the night
of his death Thats opportunity --
and her fingerprints are on the nasal
spray bottle
DULANEY
(continuing)
You cant show intent
Cardenas looks at Dulaney wryly He knows that Dulaney is
trying to discover his game plan Cardenas looks into his
can
of nuts and fishes for another cashew
DULANEY
(continuing)
Can you
CARDENAS
Take your pole out of the water
Frank The fish aint biting today
DULANEY
Youre bluffing John its me
remember Ive known you since your
name was Juan Carlos
Cardenas doesnt appreciate Dulaney mentioning his real
name

DULANEY
(continuing)
Cmon -- think about it If she was
going to kill Marsh why leave the
nasal spray bottle there for the
police to find

CARDENAS
She planned this She wanted us to
find the nasal spray

DULANEY
Why would she want that

CARDENAS
Because shes clever Because she
knows that even if we didnt find it
wed have suspicions as to why a man
in Marshs condition would use
cocaine

DULANEY
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions
arent enough for a conviction

CARDENAS
The MEs report stated that Marshs
nasal membranes showed no sign of
prior cocaine use Without the nasal
spray we would have still treated it
as a poisoning We would have looked
for motive and the trail would have
still led back to her

DULANEY
I dont buy it and neither will a
jury

CARDENAS
Were going all the way on this one
Frank Tell your client she has
until the prelim to cop a plea for
murder two -- fifteen to twenty five

DULANEY
Ill tell her but she wont take it

CARDENAS
Then shes not as smart as I thought
she was Youve seen her in the

depositions Tell me you dont have
any doubts

Rebeccas

path

DULANEY
Shes innocent

CARDENAS
Arent they all

DULANEY
Yeah Well -- well let the
blindfolded lady with the scales
decide that

Dulaney gets up slowly and leaves

INT CITY JAIL BOOKING COUNTER - AFTERNOON

Dulaney waits at the counter A barred door slides open and
Rebecca is led out by a WOMAN JAILER Even in these
surroundings she maintains her composure She walks to the
counter and waits silently

EXT CITY HALL BUILDING - AFTERNOON

As Dulaney and Rebecca leave they are once again encircled

REPORTERS screaming questions asking them to verify

arrest Dulaney plows through the crowd with Rebecca in

EXT RIVER - AFTERNOON
Gray clouds hang overhead threatening rain Tall birch
line the river the color of their leaves hinting that
is approaching Dulaney and Rebecca walk along a jogging
cut along the bank
DULANEY

I want you to know right now that the

trials going to be nasty Your sex

life is going to be dragged through

the mud Theyre going to say that
you enticed Marsh -- led him down a

She stops

dark path

REBECCA
Andrew hardly needed leading He was
a very passionate man He was eager
to explore I gave him what he
wanted We fulfilled each others
needs

DULANEY
This is a very small town -- people
here have very straight views on sex

REBECCA
m used to being on the outside
looking in The same men who will

publicly profess their moral outrage
for my sexual tastes are the same
ones who privately rest their sweaty
little hands on my legs and talk
about weekend trips together

DULANEY
Those same men will be sitting on the
jury

REBECCA
am who I am I cant deny it
anymore than you can deny who you

are I like sex different -- I like
it wild Thats not a crime
(emotional)

I loved Andrew We made love
together We made it differently
but we still made love It was our
way It was private -- and now the
whole world wants to look in through
the pretense of justice If I was
some middle-aged divorcee who screwed
him once a week do you think this
would be happening to me

walking and stares out over the River

REBECCA
Have you ever seen animals make love
Mr Dulaney They have such passion
-- such savage emotion They

hes

struggle and snarl and claw but
neither hurts the other Not really

DULANEY
No pain no gain

REBECCA
Something like that

DULANEY
Were not animals

As Rebecca speaks Dulaney seems captivated

REBECCA
Of course we are Our primal urges
are still there -- but weve taken

sex and intellectualized it refined
it down to its most essential

components Its bland easy
mechanical Theres great passion in
the struggle -- such craving in

denial Do you know what its like
to yearn for something Im not
talking about wanting or needing
Im talking about an urge so deep
that your skin burns and every cell
in your body pulses with desire

Dulaney appears moved by the passion of her words -- but
uncomfortable by it and quickly pushes it aside

DULANEY
(awkwardly)
I think were getting a little off
the subject here

REBECCA
I thought the subject was sex

DULANEY
As it pertains to you -- not me
(beat)
Did you always know you had
different tastes

REBECCA
Yes

DULANEY
How

REBECCA
I dont know if its something I can
explain to you

DULANEY
Why not

REBECCA
Because -- its beyond intellect
Its emotion Its passion It has
to be experienced -- it cant be
imagined

DULANEY
Try

Rebecca thinks for a moment

REBECCA
When I was growing up we had a
strawberry patch in our backyard So
did this family down the road I
used to sneak in their yard and steal
their strawberries It wasnt easy
The stone walls were high and Id
scrape my knees as I climbed over
On the other side were wild rose
bushes The thorns would dig into my
legs and cut my thighs as I lowered
myself down

DULANEY
If you had what you wanted at home
why did you sneak into their yard

REBECCA
Because -- somehow the fruit always
tasted that much sweeter because of
the pain it took to get to it

Dulaney appears lost in her words This isnt lost on
Rebecca
She walks off Dulaney stares after her intrigued
INT DULANEYS HOUSE DINING ROOM - EVENING

A light rain falls outside Dulaney picks at his food

stares out the window He seems oblivious to the
conversation
between Sharon and Michael

MICHAEL
Alberts got the stomach flu

SHARON
Thats too bad

MICHAEL
No its not Now I get to pitch

SHARON
Michael you shouldnt be happy when
someone else isnt feeling well

MICHAEL
No way Jerry Milner stopped by and
Albert puked right in front of him
Sharon tries to suppress a grin
SHARON

INT MICHAELS BEDROOM - EVENING

Michael lies on his bed

doing his homework The door opens

and Dulaney enters and sits beside him

DULANEY
Im sorry if it looks like Im not
paying attention to you lately

Michael looks at Dulaney somewhat confused Dulaney tries

explain it another way

DULANEY
(continuing)
You know how it is sometimes when

friends How youre really
concentrating on what youre doing --

and you lose track of time and you
come home late and Mom yells at you

MICHAEL

DULANEY
Well thats kind of how I am right

I love you

MICHAEL

INT DULANEYS OFFICE - MORNING

CHARLIE BIGGS is a tall wiry black man Street-wise but
basically good humored He is tossing a NERF BALL through a
basketball hoop mounted on the wall as Dulaney enters

BIGGS
How you doin Mister D

DULANEY
Fine Charlie You familiar with the
Marsh case

BIGGS
Yeah -- I hear they had em a real
dog and pony show going on up there -
- Ill tell you sometimes white
people are a real puzzle to me I
mean did this old guy really think
he was gonna be able to keep up with
a sweet little number like that
DULANEY
It couldve happened to anyone

BIGGS
(ghetto accent)
Im sorry man -- but I aint ever

heard of no brother dying from
gettin too much pussy

Dulaney grins in spite of himself

Dulaneys

DULANEY
We have to find out who else would
profit from Marshs death -- and who

knew enough about his personal life
to know that putting cocaine in the
nasal spray would be fatal

BIGGS

vulgar

of the cabinet is a WHITE PERSIAN CAT

REBECCA
There you are

She stands on her tip toes as she reaches up Dulaney
watches

her -- the arch of her back -- the hem of her skirt rising
up

her legs She lowers the cat down and walks to a chair and

sits down The slit of her dress opens revealing her
thighs

Dulaneys eyes trace along them Rebecca notes his gaze

REBECCA
What are you thinking

Dulaney looks up quickly

DULANEY
Nothing

REBECCA
Not true Shall I tell you what you
were thinking You were wondering if
I was wearing anything under my
briefcase

hard

skirt

The fact that he doesnt protest confirms that she is right
She runs her finger lightly along her thighs

REBECCA

Dulaney walks to the window and stares out Rebecca seems
amused She puts the cat down and walks over to him

REBECCA
Sorry I wasnt trying to embarrass

to add another room He suggested we
might convert the garage into a guest
room Hes going to check with the
contractor and let me know Ill let
you know how much and we can decide
Alright

Dulaney looks up slowly It is not so much that he has

the question -- it is more that he is aware that Sharon has

Dulaney and

I figured if we have to talk all day
we might as well do it someplace
nice

(looks at the cabin)
Isnt it beautiful

DULANEY
Yeah

REBECCA

(sadly)
Andrew loved this old cabin

(fondly remembering)
He always dreamed about moving to
Tahiti -- living in a hut and
becoming a beach-bum

(a sad smile)
I could never imagine myself doing
that -- but somehow when he talked
about it he made it sound so alive -
- so wonderful Soft ocean breezes
and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the
world and its problems behind I
wish hed had a chance to do it

Her mind drifts away for a moment locked on some distant
memory

REBECCA
(snapping out of it)
Sorry
DULANEY
Its okay

EXT LAKE FURTHER - DUSK

Dulaney and Rebecca walk along the shore A soft wind blows
through her hair

DULANEY
Tell me about Doctor Paley

REBECCA
I hardly know him He wanted me and
he couldnt have me
DULANEY
Its going to be hard to convince a
jury that hes testifying against you
in a murder trial because you blew
him off

REBECCA
(confidently)
It wont be that hard

She walks off
EXT CABIN - DUSK
Dulaney and Rebecca sit on an old porch swing

No -- I wanted to be a professional
hockey player
REBECCA

Yeah
REBECCA
That seems so far away from who you
are now What happened
DULANEY
I broke my ankle skating That ended
that dream
REBECCA
Its hard to let go of a dream isnt

Is that what you think I was
thinking
REBECCA
No -- thats what I know you were
thinking
Before Dulaney can start to protest she continues She

warmly

and

walks behind him Dulaney stares straight ahead

REBECCA
How often do you make love to your
wife Frank Once a week Sometimes
twice There once was passion
wasnt there But now its bland
predictable Tell me when you do it
-- do you always think of her Or do
you wonder what it would be like to
be with someone else Someone wild
Someone who would force you to lose
control

Her words strip his thoughts bare He is vulnerable

REBECCA
(continuing)
Theres nothing wrong in admitting
that you want me Frank

DULANEY
You take a lot for granted

Dulaney starts for the door Rebeccas cool exterior fades
giving way to her vulnerable side

REBECCA
Please stay Frank I dont want to
be alone I dont expect anything
from you -- no demands -- no
complications I just need to feel
close to someone

Dulaney turns back towards her A beat He thinks for a
moment then walks back into the room Rebecca smiles

invitingly

HIS POV - REBECCAS BEDROOM
The bedroom door is open The room is DARK -- Lit only by

moon Rebecca slowly pulls her sweater off over her head
MOONLIGHT washes over her body SILHOUETTING her She runs

hands lightly over her stomach -- working her way up to her
round full breasts She stops for a moment -- and we sense
she knows Dulaney is watching her

Dulaney stares at her -- mesmerized He knows he should
away but he cannot control the urge that moves him to look

One by one Rebecca unsnaps the buttons of her jeans

her sheer white panties She bends forward slightly and
slowly peels the jeans down to her ankles -- then steps out

them
We can see the desire on Dulaneys face He looks away

conflict inside him grows He looks back

Rebecca walks into the hall She is barefoot -- wearing a
long slinky dress -- her eyes catch Dulaneys If she
aware he was watching her before -- she is now It doesnt
seem to bother her She moves towards him slowly -- her

inviting his

Dulaney moves towards her They meet in the middle of the
room She waits -- he moves closer -- so close that he can
smell her She cranes her neck back subtly tempting him to
bring his lips to hers The longing overcomes him He

her lightly -- the kiss lingers for a moment then she grabs
him forcefully by the hair arching his head back She

his lip

her head away

She walks down the hall into the bedroom and closes the
Dulaney follows He tries the door -- its locked He
to knock -- stops -- turns and walks back into the living

He starts to leave -- stops He looks at the bedroom door
His passion builds -- his hunger for her devours him He

quickly down the hall -- eyes filled with determination He
breaks the door open with his shoulder

Rebecca is standing in the center of the room -- as if
for him He moves to her She can see the fire in his

He takes her in his arms -- kisses her neck feverishly --
feeding his craving for her

REBECCA
My way

He is lost within her now and doesnt hear her She pulls

hair jerking his head back Her eyes command him to follow
her demand

Something in him snaps -- a new door opens He pushes her
onto the DRESSING CABINET He kisses her running his hand
her thighs hiking up her dress She wraps her legs around

waist They move along the cabinet -- knocking jars and
bottles to the floor He lifts her -- carries her to the

- lays her down and rips her dress from her body Their
passion is unleased They grope and claw for one another
hungrily She pulls his shirt off and bites him on the
shoulder His face tenses from the pain but he MOANS with
pleasure

He did Look I know you can lead a
horse to water but you cant make him

in front of an old horse for long
enough -- and well

Joanne stops as emotion fills her Her eyes well with

DULANEY
You dont really believe what the
district attorney is saying about
Miss Lawson do you

JOANNE
I dont know Its incredible to
think that anyone could be capable of
doing that -- but if anyone could it
would be Rebecca

DULANEY
take it you dont like Miss Lawson
very much

JOANNE
really dont know her that well
We would say hello to each other when
would come to the house but that
was about it

DULANEY
£ you dont know her that well what
makes you think shes capable of
murder

JOANNE
Andrew was a kind and gentle man but
he was thirty years older than her
Wheres the attraction to sleep with
someone like that -- to have the kind
of sex they had

DULANEY
How do you know what kind of sex they
had

I wasnt lookin through the keyhole

their little toys all over the place

Dulaney is shocked by this

I was at the house one morning -- I
thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with
Mr Marsh When I went into the
guest bathroom she was standing in
front of the mirror pouring this
white powder out of a vial

Dulaney looks like hes been kicked in the stomach

DULANEY
(Yelling)

DULANEY

No I dont have to believe you The

INT COURTROOM - MORNING

The gallery is crowded with REPORTERS and SPECTATORS
Dulaney

sits beside Rebecca at the defense table Cardenas stands

before the jury

Dulaney and Cardenas are seated at their respective tables

Rebecca sits beside Dulaney She is wearing a beautiful
well

tailored dress She looks beautiful and has surprisingly
made

no attempt to down-play her looks

JUDGE BURNHAM a confident BLACK MAN in his fifties sits
behind

the bench He is strong-willed -- tough but fair There is
a

rough edge to him from his childhood on the streets

JUDGE BURNHAM

This trial by its very nature is
explosive The press is going to
have a field day and I will not
tolerate any activity in my courtroom
that will fuel it

(to Dulaney and

Cardenas)
Both of you are going to be delving
into very personal aspects of peoples
lives I warn you now When you do
so -- if you cannot establish a clear
line of relevancy early on in your
examinations I will stop you Is
that clear
Dulaney and Cardenas both nod

JUDGE BURNHAM
Mr Cardenas

Cardenas stands and walks towards the JURY

CARDENAS
(points to Rebecca)
You all can see the defendant
Rebecca Lawson But as this trial
proceeds you will see that she is not
only the defendant -- she is the
murder weapon itself

(stops and thinks for

a moment)
Is that possible Can a person
actually be a weapon The answer is
yes If I hit you and you die -- I
am the cause of your death But can
sex be called a weapon Yes And
what a deadly weapon Rebecca Lawson
made of it The State will prove
that Miss Lawson seduced Andrew Marsh
-- that she put increasing sexual
demands on him while she secretly
administered cocaine All the while
knowing that he had a severe heart
condition

(beat)
She is a beautiful woman -- but when
this trial is over you will see her
no differently than a gun or a knife
or any other instrument used as a
weapon She is a killer And the
worst kind -- one who disguised
herself as a loving partner

Cardenas walks back to the prosecution table and sits down

JUDGE BURNHAM
Mr Dulaney

Dulaney stands up and approaches the jury
DULANEY

I know what youre thinking -- and
its a mistake You look at Miss
Lawson and you see a beautiful woman
ho was involved with an older man --
nd you think she looks like the
ype She couldve done it And
hats exactly what the District
ttorney wants you to think Yes
he is beautiful So what Does
hat make her a killer Of course
This case is not about
ppearances Its about facts

(beat)
As Mr Cardenas presents his case you
will see that there are very few
facts -- that the bulk of the States
evidence is circumstantial Im
confident that by the conclusion of
this trial you will not just have a
reasonable doubt You will have no

gecaneaces
co

doubt at all -- that Rebecca Lawson
is innocent of the charges against
her

INT COURTROOM - LATER - DAY
McCurdy is on the witness stand Cardenas stands before
him
CARDENAS
Doctor McCurdy what was the cause of
death
MCCURDY

A massive cardiac arrest

CARDENAS
What was Mr Marshs physical
condition prior to his death

MCCURDY
Very poor He was suffering from
severe arterial disease

CARDENAS
Was the heart attack the result of
natural causes

MCCURDY

He

No

CARDENAS
What induced it

MCCURDY
We found a high concentration of
cocaine in his blood

CARDENAS
So Mr Marsh used cocaine

MCCURDY
I dont think so The membrane in
his nasal passage didnt show any
sign of long time usage

CARDENAS
Then how did it get into his body

MCCURDY
We found a bottle of Dristan nasal
spray on the nightstand It was
filled with water and cocaine Mr
Marsh had a head cold at the time of
his death I believe he wasnt aware
that he was ingesting cocaine

Cardenas holds up a bottle of NASAL SPRAY in a PLASTIC BAG
brings it over to McCurdy

CARDENAS
Is this the bottle that was found on
the nightstand

MCCURDY
(examines it)
Yes

CARDENAS
Your Honor the State enters this
evidence as exhibit A
(to McCurdy)
Were any fingerprints found on the
bottle

MCCURDY

Yes -- those of Mr Marsh and a thumb
print of Miss Lawsons

CARDENAS
Dr McCurdy what would cocaine do to
someone in Mr Marshs condition

MCCURDY
Increase his heart rate

CARDENAS
-- And if he were in the midst of
making love while under the influence
of cocaine

MCCURDY
It would be an added stress to his
heart

CARDENAS

What would be the effect if someone
secretly administered cocaine to Mr
Marsh and then induced him to make
love

MCCURDY
It would be the same as shooting a
gun at him

CARDENAS
Thank you Doctor McCurdy
(to Dulaney)
Your witness

Rebecca looks at Dulaney for his opinion of McCurdys
testimony Dulaney gives her a reassuring glance before he
stands up and approaches McCurdy

DULANEY
Can you say with any certainty that
Mr Marsh didnt ingest the cocaine
himself

MCCURDY
No -- but it seems highly unlikely
that a man in his condition would use
cocaine
DULANEY
Thats your opinion Doctor -- but
Im asking you if there is any
scientific test that can tell who
actually put the cocaine into the
Dristan bottle

MCCURDY
No

DULANEY
Thank you

INT COURTROOM - LATER - DAY

Cardenas stands before DOCTOR TRAMMEL a thin pasty-faced
man
in his fifties

CARDENAS

diagnose that Mr Marsh had heart
disease

DR TRAMMEL
About a year and half ago

CARDENAS
Did Mr Marsh change his lifestyle
after that

DR TRAMMEL
Yes -- he stopped smoking and
drinking and exercised regularly

CARDENAS
He did everything he could to take
care of his heart

DR TRAMMEL
Yes

CARDENAS
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr
Marsh to your office

DR TRAMMEL
of

Yes

CARDENAS
Just one last question What does
the sign on your office door say

DR TRAMMEL
Doctor Steven Trammel Cardiologist

Cardenas walks back to his seat signaling his examination
the witness is over Dulaney stands

DULANEY
Dr Trammel did you ever speak to
Miss Lawson about Mr Marshs
condition

DR TRAMMEL
No

DULANEY
Did Mr Marsh ever tell you that he
had spoken to Miss Lawson about his
illness

DR TRAMMEL
No

DULANEY
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr
Marsh inside during his examinations

DR TRAMMEL
No

DULANEY
Then you have no way of knowing what
Mr Marsh told Miss Lawson were the
reasons for his visits

DR TRAMMEL
No No I dont

towards

DULANEY
How do you know it was cocaine that

JOANNE
What other kind of white powder do
people keep in a vial

DULANEY
Do you remember the date when you saw
Miss Lawson in the bathroom

JOANNE
Yes-—
(thinks a moment)
It was on a Friday I remember
because I was going to visit my
sister for her birthday It would be
October twenty-eighth

DULANEY
Could you repeat the last part of
what Mr Marsh said to you the day
before his death

JOANNE
He said that if it kept up she was
going to kill him That his heart
couldnt take it

DULANEY

Didnt Mr Marsh also tell you that

Miss Lawson felt bored here and wa

s

thinking about going back to Chicago

for awhile

JOANNE
Yes -- he mentioned it

DULANEY
So the woman he loved passionatel
was thinking about leaving That
must cause tremendous anxiety
Sleepless nights Incredible stre

JOANNE
I suppose

DULANEY

So isnt it possible that he was

confiding in you about the pain he
was feeling about losing what migh
be his last chance for love That
what he really was saying was that
the uncertainty of her leaving was
driving him crazy and if it didnt
stop it was going to kill him Th
if she did leave his heart couldn
take it

groin -- as she kisses him passionately Dulaney is lost in
her kiss for a moment then breaks it off and looks around

Rebecca smiles -- takes off her shoes and stands on the hood
her car She takes one of the shoes and hits the PARKING

OVERHEAD LIGHT FIXTURE The BULB breaks sending the area in
darkness
DULANEY
What are you doing

She steps down and kisses him again For a moment he tries

to
resist
REBECCA
I want you inside me
His desire fills him He pushes her back onto the hood of
her
car hiking up her dress with his hands as she reaches down
and unbuttons his pants
INT REBECCAS BEDROOM - NIGHT
The room is dimly lit Dulaney is in bed He appears to be
deep in thought Rebecca enters wearing a sheer silk
bathrobe
and carrying a tea service on a tray He places it on the
bed
and sits beside him
REBECCA
Something wrong
DULANEY
Paley could be a problem tomorrow

REBECCA
Im sure youll be able to handle
him
DULANEY
Im glad you have such confidence in
me
REBECCA

Dont worry about Paley He cant
touch me No one can Ive thought
it all out

DULANEY
(sits up very
concerned)
looks

into

parts

her

the

the

watches

What does that mean Youve been
thinking about the case Or you
thought everything out before you
killed Marsh

The question hurts Rebecca -- it shows on her face She

away from him A beat Dulaney thinks He feels bad for
asking such a question

DULANEY
Im sorry
(she doesnt look at
him)
Rebecca -- Im sorry Really

He takes her hand She slowly looks at him and smiles She
points to the tea service

REBECCA
Sugar or honey

DULANEY
Honey

She lifts a PLASTIC BOTTLE of HONEY and starts to pour it
a cup She stops and smiles seductively at Dulaney then
her bathrobe and slowly draws a liquid line with it along
thigh She reaches out -- grabs him by the hair and gently
pulls him forward He kisses her knee and slowly runs his
tongue along her thigh following the trail upwards She

arches her back -- closes her eyes -- breathes deeply from

pleasure of his touch

INT DULANEYS BEDROOM - NIGHT
Dark The door opens -- light from the hall streaks into
room Sharon is asleep Dulaney enters quietly He

her He looks over at the nightstand

HIS POV
A PHOTOGRAPH of Dulaney and Sharon on vacation Dulaney is
carrying her on a beach He is wearing a LARGE SOMBRERO

They

are both laughing

Dulaney looks back at Sharon He is a man lost within
himself

He walks to the bathroom Sharon opens her eyes and stares
at

him

INT COURTROOM - MORNING
Court is in session Cardenas stands

CARDENAS
The State calls Doctor Alan Paley

Doctor Paley stands and walks towards the witness stand
CARDENAS AND PALEY - MOMENTS LATER

CARDENAS

What eventually happened to your
relationship with Miss Lawson

DR PALEY
We stopped seeing each other

CARDENAS
Why
DR PALEY
Well -- I realized that she wasnt

interested in me She was just

trying to

What kind

get information out of me

CARDENAS
of information

DR PALEY

She said that she was working on a

novel and

she wanted to know what

kinds of drugs would be harmful to
someone with a bad heart

WHISPERS from the crowd fill the room

CARDENAS

Did you suggest any

Dulaney approaches Paley with a smile

DULANEY

Dr Paley where were you the last
time you saw Miss Lawson

DR PALEY
We had dinner at a restaurant

DULANEY
Isnt it true that later that night
you tried to force yourself on Miss
Lawson in the parking lot

DR PALEY
No

DULANEY
You didnt grab her and try to kiss
her

DR PALEY
No

DULANEY
If necessary I can bring in the valet
parking attendant and two customers
who witnessed the occurrence

Paley thinks for a moment He is nervous

DR PALEY
Well -- as I remember it we had an
argument

DULANEY

And the argument was about the fact
that you wanted to be romantically
involved and she did not

DR PALEY
(hesitantly)
Yes

DULANEY
And after that didnt you
continuously harass Miss Lawson

DR PALEY
No
Dulaney walks back to his desk and removes a TAPE PLAYER
from a
cardboard box

DULANEY
Your Honor this is a tape from Miss
Lawsons answering machine I would
like to play it now

CARDENAS
Objection Your Honor we dont know
where this tape is from Who made it
-- or under what circumstances it was
made

Dulaney takes out two pieces of PAPER and approaches the
bench

DULANEY
These are reports from two
independent audio labs They each
state that the voices were recorded
over the phone and that no
alterations have been made

Judge Burnham studies the paper

JUDGE BURNHAM
Tll allow it

Dulaney walks back to his desk and presses the PLAY BUTTON
We
HEAR a BEEP then

DR PALEYS VOICE
Rebecca -- I know youre there
Godammit Answer the phone you
bitch You cant treat me like this

We HEAR a PHONE slam down Another BEEP

DR PALEYS VOICE
You want to play games with me Who
the fuck do you think you are Okay -
- well play Youll be sorry

Dulaney stops the machine He takes a dramatic pause
letting

light

the words on the tape sink in

Cardenas is dismayed and tries to hide his frustration
Dulaney approaches Paley who is now very nervous

Dr

INT

DULANEY
(quoting)
Youll be sorry

DR PALEY
I was angry

DULANEY
Youre still angry arent you
Isnt it true that your whole story
is nothing more than a vindictive
attempt on your behalf to get back at
Miss Lawson

DR PALEY
No -- she asked me about cocaine

DULANEY
I suggest it never happened

DR PALEY
(angrily)
You can suggest anything you want
It happened

DULANEY
No further questions

DR PALEY
I may have been infatuated with her -
- but I wouldnt perjure myself

DULANEY
Thats all Dr Paley

the room Dulaney and Rebecca are on the bed She sits on
of him writhing back and forth -- lost in the rhythm of
love making

CLOSE ON DULANEY - LATER

He is asleep laying on his back -- the sheets pulled up to
waist LIGHTNING FLASHES outside -- a CLAP of THUNDER

He stirs and wakes up

HIS POV

Another FLASH OF LIGHTNING illuminates Rebecca who is

over him in a sexy silk ROBE Dulaney starts to sit up but

something restrains him He is HANDCUFFED to the BRASS HEAD
BOARD

DULANEY
What the What are you doing
She sits next to him -- looks at him fondly -- gently

his face with her hand

DULANEY
(nervously)
Rebecca -- take these off
REBECCA

Tonight we open new doors

She slowly drags the tip of her finger up his stomach -- to
chest Dulaney follows it with his eyes Rebecca picks up
LARGE CANDLE on the nightstand and moves it slowly -- back
forth over his chest

DULANEY
What are you going you doing

REBECCA
Are you scared

He doesnt answer He doesnt have to She can see the
fear
in his eyes She tilts the candle -- a stream of WAX pours
out
on his chest Dulaney winces with pain his body arching on
the bed his hands straining against his restraints
She smiles -- a wicked smile then pours more wax making a
thin trail of LITTLE BEADS that moves down his chest towards
his stomach Dulaneys face cringes He stares at her
through
eyes filled with fear
REBECCA
(whispering)
I love you Frank I love your
strength -- be strong for me now
She continues to pour the wax in little BEADS filling his
navel and working her way towards his groin
DULANEY
(pleading)
Rebecca -- please No more
Rebecca stares at him warmly -- fondly
REBECCA
I told you in the beginning that it
was my way My way can be many
things -- pleasure or pain
She lifts a bottle of white vinegar and holds it over his
burn
He tenses as she pours it on his chest -- then relaxes
when

he realizes its water He breathes a SIGH of relief

REBECCA
You see how life is Frank We judge
things We look at things from the
outside and assume we know whats on
the inside

She takes a sip from the bottle

REBECCA
Water But you assumed it was
vinegar -- because you were only
looking at the outside

Her meaning isnt lost on Dulaney She watches him -- as if
studying him -- then slowly -- very slowly she pulls on

belt of her ROBE The robe parts revealing the beauty of
body She gently lowers herself on top of him -- pressing

breasts against him Dulaneys breathing quickens in
excitement Rebecca moves her head to his chest -- kissing

burns softly while her fingers caress lightly over his

She gradually moves her head down -- lower -- and lower
CLOSE ON DULANEY

he stares at the ceiling -- his mind a maze of confusion
the power of her touch fills him -- overpowering him His
close The pain that only moments ago filled his body is
replaced with pleasure

INT DULANEYS HOUSE - NIGHT

Its late Dulaney enters quietly and heads for the stairs
LIGHT comes on Sharon is sitting on the couch waiting

SHARON
Late night

Her voice startles Dulaney

DULANEY
Yeah -- what are you doing up

SHARON
We have to talk

DULANEY
Whats wrong

SHARON
Thats what I was hoping youd tell
me
Dulaney enters the living room

DULANEY
Sharon its late Can we get to the
point

SHARON

Where have you been

DULANEY
Working Charlie and I were going
over some statements

SHARON
Charlie called at eleven thirty
looking for you
(beat)
You were with her werent you

DULANEY
Yes

SHARON
Why did you lie to me

DULANEY
Because I knew youd think exactly
what youre thinking

Sharon springs off the couch

SHARON
This isnt a courtroom Dont try to
turn this around on me

DULANEY
Im not

SHARON
Youre sleeping with her arent you

DULANEY
No

SHARON
Its bad enough that you are Its
even worse that you can stand here
and lie to me

She starts to walks out of the room Dulaney grabs her by

the
arm
DULANEY
Sharon
She swings around and slaps him across the face then stares
at
him angrily her eyes filled with tears
SHARON
You bastard Do you think Im some
kind of idiot That I dont have
fuckin eyes I see I feel I
hurt

She walks out of the room leaving Dulaney alone with his
thoughts

INT COURTROOM - DAY

ESTER CRAWFORD is on the stand She is a BLACK WOMAN in her

thirties -- thin and tired-looking although we get the

impression she once was pretty She is dressed in what is

obviously her Sunday dress Cardenas questions her
CARDENAS

Mrs Crawford you were Mr Marshs
maid for nine years

ESTER
Yes

CARDENAS
Did Miss Lawson and Mr Marsh ever
argue

ESTER

Like cats and dogs

CARDENAS
What did they argue about

ESTER
You name it -- they argued about it
Mr Marsh tried his best to keep her

happy -- but it seemed that no matter
what he did it was never enough for
her

CARDENAS
Did they argue the day before he
died

ESTER
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I
have the weekends off -- but they

were ripping at each other with both
barrels Friday afternoon

CARDENAS
What was the nature of the argument

ESTER
Sex

CARDENAS
Could you be more specific

ESTER
She was calling Mr Marsh an old man
-- making discourteous insinuations
about his sexual abilities She said
that she had needs and that if he
couldnt fulfill them shed find
someone who could

Dulaney jots down a note Cardenas continues

CARDENAS
Did you ever see Mr Marsh use
cocaine

ESTER
No -- never

CARDENAS
(to Dulaney)

Your witness

Cardenas sits down Dulaney approaches Ester with a smile
DULANEY
Did you go to college Mrs Crawford

ESTER
No

DULANEY
High school

ESTER
No

CARDENAS
Your Honor I fail to see what Mrs
Crawfords educational background has
to do with this case

DULANEY
I was just about to make my point
Your Honor

JUDGE BURNHAM
Do it quickly Mr Dulaney

DULANEY
(reading from note
pad)
Discourteous insinuations about his
sexual abilities Who told you to
say that

Ester doesnt answer but her eyes drift past Dulaney and
focus
on Troxell Dulaney follows her stare

DULANEY
Did Mr Troxell help you with that
phrase

Troxell and Cardenas squirm a little

ESTER
I heard him say it

DULANEY
Then -- those are not your own words

ESTER

No

DULANEY
What else did the District Attorneys
Office tell you to say

CARDENAS
Objection Your Honor The fact that
Mrs Crawford heard Mr Troxell
reconstruct her sentence and decided
to rephrase her words in a more
intelligent manner for the court
doesnt mean the incident never
happened

DULANEY
(to Cardenas)
Im just curious to see if Mr
Troxell reconstructed anything else

CARDENAS
Your Honor -- please

JUDGE BURNHAM
Ill see both of you in my chambers
Right now

INT JUDGE BURNHAMS CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER

Judge Burnham lights a cigarette and sits on the edge of his
desk Dulaney and Cardenas stand before him

JUDGE BURNHAM
Mr Dulaney before you cast
aspersions on the District Attorneys
Office by suggesting theyve coaxed
this witness to say things that
arent true -- you better have more
than a hunch Do you

DULANEY
No Your Honor

JUDGE BURNHAM
Maybe you dont know what its like
where Mrs Crawford comes from -- but
I do I came from a neighborhood

just like hers This is a whole
other world for her Shes a poor
working woman who has been thrust
into a room full of highly educated
and mostly unsympathetic people So
she puts on her best dress fixes her
hair and tries to present herself as
intelligently as possible

(beat)
Being poor and having pride is not a
crime Mr Dulaney -- and before you
attempt to impeach another witness
testimony in my courtroom -- your
foundations better be based on
something other than semantics

EXT COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOON
Dulaney walks down the steps Cardenas joins him

CARDENAS
Im surprised you can walk after the
way Burnham chewed your ass out this
afternoon

Cardenas grins His comment was meant as a friendly jab
between old friends Dulaney doesnt see it that way

DULANEY
(coldly)
Ive got work to do

CARDENAS
Hey -- the bells sounded Its
between rounds

DULANEY
I didnt hear it

CARDENAS
Whats happening to you Frank
Youre acting like youre on trial
here This has become personal to
you

DULANEY
Back off John
Cardenas studies him for a moment

CARDENAS
Youre sleeping with her arent you

Dulaney forces a laugh Its not a very convincing one

DULANEY
Thats ridiculous

CARDENAS
Im talking to you as a friend now
Dont ruin your life your career for
her Shell spit you out when this

is over

DULANEY
You dont know what youre talking
about

CARDENAS

Really What does an attorney speak
to his client about at her house
until three oclock in the morning

DULANEY
Youve been following me

CARDENAS
Her Its an obvious move Im
building a case against her
remember
Something in Dulaney snaps He grabs Cardenas and pushes
him
up against the wall Cardenas pushes back
CARDENAS
If your head wasnt up your ass you
would have thought of it too Youre
losing perspective Get out while
you can -- before she takes you down
with her

INT HALLWAY - AFTERNOON
the

bothers

The

Dulaney walks towards his office Biggs walks quickly down

hall and joins him

BIGGS
Ive been waiting for you to get
back

DULANEY

You got something on the coke

BIGGS
No -- but I got something

Biggs steps into Dulaneys office Dulaney follows

INT DULANEYS OFFICE - MORNING

Biggs picks up a remote control off the desk and sits on the
couch Dulaney sits at his desk

BIGGS
During lunch I was watching some of
Marshs home videos

Biggs clicks the control On the TV we see Rebecca on top
Marsh in the bedroom
BIGGS
He was really into recording this
stuff The DAs office found a box
full of tapes
Watching Rebecca with Marsh bothers Dulaney
BIGGS
This girl has really got some moves
huh
Dulaney stands up and turns off the television
DULANEY
If you want to get your kicks go to a
video store and rent a porno movie
Biggs studies Dulaney for a moment Dulaneys reaction

him He turns the TV back on and fast forwards the tape

screen turns to SNOW where the tape has been recorded over

the

a
seconds

grinding

her

Rebecca

BIGGS
This tape was recorded over an
existing recording

DULANEY
Over what

Biggs raises a hand signaling patience SNOW still fills
TV screen

BIGGS
I would have missed it -- but the
phone rang and I let it play while I
talked It looks like blank tape --
but it isnt Its been erased
without any input signal coming in

DULANEY
So what good is it to us if its
been erased

BIGGS
Its very good -- because when the
DAs office saw it they assumed it
was the end of the tape otherwise
they would have buried it

DULANEY
Why

BIGGS
Because it hasnt all been erased

Biggs looks at the screen A beat The SNOW dissolves and
picture fades in The PICTURE LASTS only about five
We see Rebecca from the back as she straddles Marsh

up and down on the bed -- her hair flowing down her back
Marsh raises his hand His WRIST IS IN A CAST She turns

head to the side and as she does we see that it is not

-- but Joanne Braslow The Tape clicks off
Dulaney stares at the blank screen
DULANEY
(quoting Joanne)

Wheres the attraction to sleep with
someone like that

EXT PARKING LOT - DUSK

Joanne Braslow walks to her BMW 325i She is about to open

the
door when Dulaney approaches her
DULANEY
I need to speak with you

JOANNE
I dont think we have anything more
to talk about Mr Dulaney
She starts to get in the car
DULANEY
You were sleeping with Marsh
She stops -- appears shocked that he knows this There is
now
a different quality to her -- an edge
JOANNE

Who told you that

DULANEY
He video taped you

JOANNE
That bastard

DULANEY
I thought he was a kind gentle man

Joanne doesnt appreciate Dulaney throwing her words back in
her face

JOANNE
Yes I slept with him but that was a
long time ago

cold

DULANEY
Youre lying Marsh was wearing a
cast on the tape It was right
before he went to Chicago and met
Miss Lawson He dumped you for her
didnt he

Joanne cant hold back the emotion that is building

JOANNE
Yes

DULANEY
It must have been horrible Having
to go there -- seeing them together -

- knowing he was sleeping with her in
the same bed he did with you

JOANNE
I was jealous Of course I was hurt
He switched me off like a little toy
he was finished playing with But I
didnt kill him

Dulaney studies her

JOANNE
(continuing)
Im a practical woman Mr Dulaney
Killing Andrew wasnt in my best
interest As it is Im out of a job
and Im not in his will

DULANEY
Money isnt the only reason people
commit murder Miss Braslow

Dulaney walks off Joanne stares after him Her face is

showing no sign of emotion

INT COURTROOM - DAY

Dulaney sits beside Rebecca but he seems distant Cardenas
stands up
CARDENAS
The State calls Jeffery Roston

As soon as she hears the name Rebeccas face becomes tense
nervous Dulaney notices it He checks a list

DULANEY
Your Honor I dont see a Mr Roston
listed as a prosecution witness

CARDENAS
The States investigation just
uncovered Mr Roston yesterday
afternoon in Chicago

Judge Burnham motions for Dulaney and Cardenas to approach

the
bench
CARDENAS
Your Honor Mr Roston is an ex-lover
of Miss Lawsons
JUDGE BURNHAM
Why didnt the States investigation
uncover Mr Roston earlier
CARDENAS
He was away on an extended vacation
and just returned two days ago
JUDGE BURNHAM
Alright -- Im going to allow his
testimony

DULANEY

But Your Honor--

JUDGE BURNHAM
Thats it Mr Dulaney Take a seat

Dulaney walks back to his chair Rebecca appears genuinely
nervous

INT COURTROOM - LATER

Cardenas stands before ROSTON a handsome man with salt and
pepper hair in his late fifties

CARDENAS
Mr Roston what was your
relationship with Miss Lawson

ROSTON
We were lovers

CARDENAS
How long were you together

ROSTON
For about one year

CARDENAS
How would you describe your sex life
with Miss Lawson

ROSTON
Intense

CARDENAS
I know this is a very personal
subject but could you be a little
more specific

ROSTON
It was wild She was constantly
trying to get me more and more worked
up -- kinky things I tried to
satisfy her the best I could but it
was difficult in my condition

CARDENAS
What kind of condition are you
referring to

ROSTON
I had a bad heart

There is an AUDIBLE GASP from the crowd Cardenas waits
giving the jury plenty of time to digest the implications of
Rostons last statement
Dulaney looks at Rebecca dumbfounded He tries to control
his

surprise from the eyes of the jury but he cant He stares
ahead with a blank expression as he listens to the rest of
the
testimony

CARDENAS
What happened next

ROSTON
I had bypass surgery

CARDENAS
And how are you now

ROSTON
Fine The doctors say if I keep
taking care of myself I can live to
be a very old man

CARDENAS
How did your relationship with Miss
Lawson progress after the surgery

ROSTON
It didnt

CARDENAS
Why not

ROSTON
She left me

Dulaney slowly turns and looks at Rebecca The anger and
his
sense of betrayal show on his face

CARDENAS
Why did she say she was leaving

ROSTON
She didnt She just left

CARDENAS
Why do you think she left you

ROSTON
Well -- I think that after the
operation she realized that

It takes Dulaney a few seconds to object to the question
He

is clearly preoccupied with the implications of Rostons
testimony

DULANEY
Objection The question calls fora
conclusion on the part of the
witness

CARDENAS
Your Honor Mr Roston lived with the
defendant for many months I feel

that his opinion is valid in
substantiating the character of the
Miss Lawson

DULANEY
The opinion of a scorned lover is
hardly an objective view

JUDGE BURNHAM
Objection sustained

CARDENAS
Did Miss Lawson ever give you any
indication why she was leaving

DULANEY
Objection The witness has already
stated that Miss Lawson left without
an explanation

JUDGE BURNHAM
Mr Cardenas I suggest you move on
to another line of questioning

CARDENAS
When you say your sexual relations
with Miss Lawson were intense what
exactly do you mean

ROSTON
It was like she was trying to push me
as far as she could She called it
opening new doors

CARDENAS
Can you give the court an example

ROSTON
It was like sex was a game to her
She got off on the control She
always used to tell me it had to be
her way

This strikes a chord with Dulaney

ROSTON
(continuing)
Its hard to resist a woman as
beautiful as she is

CARDENAS
What would she do that made it hard
to resist

ROSTON
Shes a woman who is very much aware
of her own sexuality Sometimes I
felt she could read my mind It was
uncanny how she knew exactly what I
wanted A few nights before my heart
surgery Rebecca woke me She had
handcuffed me to the bed

There are a few SNICKERS from the crowd Dulaney is
thinking

about the familiarity of Rostons testimony Judge Burnham

BANGS his GAVEL The crowd becomes silent

ROSTON
She told me that tonight we were
going to open new doors I asked her
to stop -- to take off the handcuffs
but she wouldnt listen

CARDENAS
What did she say

Roston is clearly uncomfortable having to relate this part
of
his life

CARDENAS
Mr Roston I know this is difficult
for you but its important you tell
the court what she did

ROSTON
BANGS

usher

She said she was going to fuck me
like Ive never been fucked before

More noise from the Crowd Judge Burnham is annoyed He
his gavel again

JUDGE BURNHAM
Due to the sensitive nature of this
witness testimony and the inability
of the spectators to allow him to
complete it I am clearing the
courtroom

Sounds of protest fill the room as the BAILIFFS start to

out the crowd

INT COURTROOM LATER

The gallery is empty Only Dulaney Rebecca Cardenas
Troxell Roston Judge Burnham The Jury and Court Officials
remain

CARDENAS
What did she do next Mr Roston

ROSTON
She started touching herself and
telling me how much she wanted me
She reached down and put me inside
her My doctor had warned me about
exerting myself -- but you really
dont think of those things at a
moment like that You just think
about how beautiful this woman is --
how much you want her How deeply
you want to please her

(beat)
At first it started off slowly -- but
the rhythm built and built Every

time I got close to an orgasm she
would stop Eventually I started to
have trouble breathing Rebecca just
kept going -- faster and faster No
matter what I said she wouldnt stop
I really thought for a moment I was
going to die

CARDENAS
If you knew it was bad for you why
did you do it

ROSTON
I couldnt help myself You get lost
inside a women like her It was like
a drug It was the best sex I ever
had

CARDENAS
What happened after that

ROSTON
I woke up the next morning and she
was gone

CARDENAS
Did you change your will while you
were with Miss Lawson

ROSTON
Yes
CARDENAS
Who was your primary beneficiary
ROSTON
She was
CARDENAS
Thank you The State rests
JUDGE BURNHAM
Mister Dulaney
Dulaney is stunned -- deep in thought He doesnt appear to
hear the question
JUDGE BURNHAM
Mister Dulaney
Dulaney looks at the jury What he sees isnt good He
thinks

for a moment He leans over and quickly speaks with
Rebecca
We cannot hear them -- but their conversation is heated

Rebecca says something Dulaney looks at Roston

Dulaney stands

DULANEY
Mr Roston you said it was the best
sex you ever had Is that the best
sex with a woman or a man

Cardenas bolts from his seat

CARDENAS
Objection

DULANEY
Ill rephrase the question Mr
Roston isnt it true you are
bisexual

CARDENAS
Objection Mr Rostons sexual
preferences are not at issue in this
trial

DULANEY
Your Honor Im trying to establish
the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson
felt when she discovered the man she
lived with was a different person
than she thought he was

Judge Burnham thinks for a moment

JUDGE BURNHAM
The witness will answer the question

DULANEY
Mr Roston

ROSTON
Yes

DULANEY
And your sexual tastes were something
that you hid from Miss Lawson

ROSTON
Yes

A beat
filled

is

They

Rebecca

DULANEY
And didnt Miss Lawson come home one
day and find you in bed with your
male lover

ROSTON
Yes

DULANEY
And she left shortly after that

A pause Roston thinks struggling to make a decision
ROSTON
No We worked things out It was
three weeks later when I told her
about the heart surgery that she
left
Roston looks around the court room He is embarrassed
with emotion
DULANEY
Would it be fair to say that when she
did find out it was a shock to her
ROSTON
(very upset)

Yes

DULANEY
No further questions

Roston looks at the jury -- their disapproving stares He

on the verge of tears

INT REBECCAS HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
Rebecca opens the door A tired-looking Dulaney enters
walk to the couch together in silence Dulaney sits

lifts a BOTTLE of CHAMPAGNE out of an ice bucket

DULANEY
Whats that for

REBECCA
To celebrate how masterfully you
destroyed Roston today

DULANEY
Rebecca -- we shattered a mans life
in open court

REBECCA
(suddenly ice cold)
Fuck him He tried to shatter mine

DULANEY
He was only doing what he thought was
right

REBECCA

Youre too weak Frank When you
want something you have to do what-
ever it takes to get it If

Dulaney stares at her The person he sees has no feelings -
no empathy for anyone

DULANEY
You killed him -- didnt you

REBECCA
I knew you were thinking that I
could see it in your eyes today in
the courtroom Youre wrong Frank
I need you to believe that

DULANEY
You dont need anybody

Theyve already convicted me

DULANEY

REBECCA
(matter of factly)

No -- youre not

Rebecca picks up a REMOTE CONTROL from the coffee table and
pushes a button

CLOSE ON TELEVISION

A TAPE of Dulaney making love to Rebecca fills the screen
is wild passionate

CLOSE ON DULANEY

he is dumbfounded as he watches The implications of what
tape could do to him run through his mind

Something in Dulaney snaps He grabs Rebecca They
falling down onto the coffee table The CHAMPAGNE bottle

crashes to the floor Rebecca rolls off the table to the
floor She sits up and moves away from Dulaney by pushing

herself backwards Dulaney lunges at her His hand
her ankle Rebecca kicks -- breaks free -- stands up
gets to his feet -- runs after her He grabs her by the

and smashes her into the wall He slaps her across the
A thin stream of blood flows from the corner of her mouth
smiles

REBECCA

It gets easier doesnt it Once you
open the door it never closes
Dulaney realizes what he is doing He stares at her in

horror
then walks towards the door He stops Goes back to the VHS
machine He pushes the EJECT BUTTON on the VCR removes the
tape and destroys it

REBECCA
Ive got another copy How do you
think your wife would feel if she saw
this -- not to mention your
colleagues
Dulaneys temper is near the breaking point again he
strains
to control himself

what

is going on he can sense the tension The DOORBELL RINGS

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Dulaney answers the front door and Biggs rushes in excited
BIGGS

Im sorry to barge in -- but I
figured after that bombshell that got
laid on you today you could use some
good news

DULANEY
You got something on the Coke

Biggs grins

BIGGS
Do I I talked to one of the dealers
I put the word out to Hes been
following the trial pretty closely
He said at one time he wanted to be a
lawyer before he became a dealer

DULANEY
Charlie -- are you going to make a
point soon
BIGGS
Right now Guess whos been buying
Coke from him for the last five and
half years
Dulaney shrugs his shoulders indicating he doesnt have a
clue
BIGGS
Marshs secretary -- Joanne Braslow
Confusion fills Dulaneys face
INT COURTROOM - MORNING
Court is in session Rebecca looks around the courtroom
trying to get a feel of the CROWDS opinion Dulaney is not
there She looks at the door anxiously The rooms waits
A
beat Dulaney enters -- sits beside Rebecca -- but acts as
if

she isnt there

INT COURTROOM - LATER

Dulaney stands at the witness stand in front of an ORIENTAL

in his thirties

DULANEY

Dr Wong -- what type of medicine do

you practice

DR WONG
Oriental medicine

DULANEY
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of
yours

DR WONG
Yes Ive been seeing her for over a
year

DULANEY

Why does she come to you

DR WONG

She suffers from severe menstrual

cramps

DULANEY

Did you ever prescribe any medication

for her cramps

DR WONG
Yes

DULANEY

What did you prescribe for her

DR WONG
Chinese peony root

DULANEY

Would you describe for the court what
Chinese peony root looks like

DR WONG

Its a white powder that comes in a

vial

There is a MOAN from the CROWD

DULANEY

Cardenas looks at Troxell
How do you instruct your patients to
take it

DR WONG
I tell them to pour an amount the
size of a quarter into the their hand
and mix it with water

DULANEY
A previous witness stated that she
saw Miss Lawson pouring a white
powder into her hand on October
twenty-eighth According to your
records when did you prescribe the
drug

Dr Wong checks his records

DR WONG
October twenty-seventh

DULANEY
One last question Doctor If
someone didnt know better would it
be easy to mistake the peony root for
cocaine

DR WONG
Yes -- quite easy

DULANEY
(to Cardenas)
Your witness

Cardenas realizes there is nothing to gain by examining this
witness

CARDENAS
No questions

JUDGE BURNHAM
You may call your next witness

DULANEY
The defense calls Miss Margaret
Sellers
Cardenas looks worried as he watches an attractive woman in

her
mid twenties approach the stand
DULANEY AND MISS SELLERS
Miss Sellers appears a little nervous Dulaney smiles
warmly
DULANEY
Miss Sellers do you know Dr Alan
Paley
MISS SELLERS
Yes
DULANEY
Where did you meet him
MISS SELLERS
Im a nurse I used to work at
Roseburg Memorial Hospital Dr
Paleys on staff there
DULANEY
What was the nature of your
relationship with Dr Paley
MISS SELLERS
We dated for about a month last year
DULANEY
Then what happened
MISS SELLERS
I realized he wasnt serious He was
seeing other women -- asking other
nurses at the hospital out so I
ended it

DULANEY

-- And what did Dr Paley do after
you stopped seeing him

MISS SELLERS
He used to call me -- tell me that I
couldnt just walk out on him He
said that if I didnt come back hed

make my life miserable

DULANEY
Did he make your life miserable

MISS SELLERS
Yes -- he did

DULANEY
How

Cardenas stands again

CARDENAS
Objection May I remind Mr Dulaney
that the person on trial here is Miss
Lawson -- not Dr Paley

DULANEY
Your Honor Im trying to establish a
pattern in Dr Paleys behavior with
women

JUDGE BURNHAM
Objection overruled The witness
will answer the question

MISS SELLERS
Hed call me in the middle of the
night Show up at my house and bang
on the door Finally after two weeks
I went to his office one day to tell
him to stop

DULANEY
What did he say

MISS SELLERS
He laughed -- and basically said he
would decide when it was over

DULANEY
Do you remember his exact words

MISS SELLERS
Yes He said If you want to play
games well play -- and youll be
sorry
Another BUZZ from the CROWD Cardenas inwardly cringes

DULANEY
What happened next

MISS SELLERS
While I was seeing Dr Paley I
mentioned to him one night that
someone was stealing drugs from the
third floor dispensary Three days
after I spoke to him in his office he
went to the Head Nurse and told her
he had witnessed me stealing drugs

DULANEY
What happened

MISS SELLERS
There was an inquiry It was his
word against mine They believed
him I was fired

INT DULANEYS OFFICE - DUSK
Dulaney is at his desk Biggs enters excited

BIGGS
Joanne Braslow is getting more and
more interesting I followed her
today to an attorneys office
Joseph Koehler

DULANEY
Joe Koehler I know him Hes an
estate attorney -- and hes very
expensive

BIGGS

What would Joanne Braslow need with
an estate attorney She wasnt even
mentioned in Marshs will

Dulaney thinks for a moment He grins as an idea enters his
mind

DULANEY
Not this will

INT FILE ROOM - EVENING

Dulaney and Biggs sit at a table going through a stack of
papers Dulaney traces his finger along a piece of paper

DULANEY
Here it is According to the old
will Joanne Braslow was to inherit
two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars

BIGGS
What good does that do -- its the
old will

DULANEY
Under the law a person cannot profit
from their own wrong doing Since
Rebecca Lawson is the sole
beneficiary of the new will if she
is found guilty the will is void and
Joanne Braslow could make a very good
case to have the old will reinstated

BIGGS
She kills the old man and makes it
look like Miss Lawson did it Pretty
slick

INT DULANEYS HOUSE BATHROOM - EVENING

Dulaney is washing up for dinner He speaks to Sharon who
is
in the bedroom

DULANEY
I was thinking that when the trial is
over wed all go skiing for a
weekend

SHARON
Maybe it would be a good idea if you
just took Michael
Sharon leaves the room Dulaney reaches for his TOOTHBRUSH

picks up a TUBE of TOOTH PASTE It is empty He stares at

INT COURTROOM - MORNING

Dulaney looks worn tired -- the tension between him and
Rebecca shows

JUDGE BURNHAM
Mr Dulaney are you ready to call
your next witness

Dulaney doesnt seem to hear him

JUDGE BURNHAM
Mr Dulaney are you with us

Dulaney snaps out of it

DULANEY
Yes Your Honor The defense recalls
Joanne Braslow

As Joanne walks towards the stand Dulaney looks over at
Rebecca Its as if he is trying to make up his mind about
her Joanne takes her seat

JUDGE BURNHAM
Miss Braslow Id like to remind you
that you are still under oath

DULANEY
How often do you use cocaine

Cardenas shoots out of his seat

CARDENAS
Objection Your Honor

JUDGE BURNHAM
(impatiently)

Counsel approach the bench

Dulaney and Cardenas walk over to the bench

JUDGE BURNHAM
Mr Dulaney Im getting tired of
seeing you this close to me

Judge Burnham looks at Cardenas indicating he will hear his
argument now

CARDENAS
Whether or not Miss Braslow uses
drugs is not an issue here

DULANEY
Your Honor -- the prosecution has
introduced cocaine as one of the
contributing reasons Mr Marsh died
How it may have been introduced into
the household is of vital importance

JUDGE BURNHAM
Are you able to back up this
allegation -- or are you fishing

DULANEY
I can back it up

JUDGE BURNHAM
You better
(to Joanne)
Please answer the question

JOANNE
Ive tried it

DULANEY
Youve tried it Isnt it true that
youve been in and out of Rehab
centers for the last four years

This is clearly embarrassing for her

JOANNE
Ive been to a few -- yes

DULANEY
You dont like Miss Lawson much do
you
JOANNE
(hesitantly)
No

DULANEY
You dont like her because you were
involved with Mr Marsh before she
came along Isnt that true

JOANNE
Yes

DULANEY
You resented the fact that she told
you what to do in Mr Marshs house

JOANNE
Yes

Dulaney moves the questions along quickening their pace
building a rhythm

DULANEY
And you resented that he cared for
her in a way he once cared for you

JOANNE
(breaking down)
Yes

DULANEY
--And that Mr Marsh paid less
attention to you

JOANNE
Yes

DULANEY
--and that he changed his will

JOANNE
Yes

She has blurted out the answer before the full implications
of

the question has dawned on her Her face reveals her
mistake
Cardenas can only watch uncomfortably from his seat

DULANEY
In his previous will Mr Marsh left
you two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars -- then he cut you out Why
do you think he did that

JOANNE
She talked him into it She wanted
everything

DULANEY
Two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars is a lot of money That must
have made you pretty angry

JOANNE
Yes

Dulaney picks up a small PIECE OF PAPER and walks towards
Joanne

DULANEY
You testified that you returned to
Mr Marshs house at eleven oclock
the night of his murder Is that
correct

JOANNE
Yes

DULANEY

Well - Ima little confused

(holds up the paper)
This is a charge receipt from Rosens
Drug Store where Mr Marsh had an
account Its dated the day of the
murder

(hands it to her)
Is this your signature

JOANNE
(nervously studies
it)

Yes

DULANEY

Theres an item you picked up thats
marked Will you read it

JOANNE
Dristan nasal spray

DULANEY
Would you read for us the time of the
purchase

JOANNE
Three fifteen

DULANEY
AM -- or PM

JOANNE
PM

DULANEY

You see thats what bothers me No
other bottle of nasal spray was found
in the house The police looked
There was only the one bottle But
you say you didnt arrive until after
Mr Marsh was dead -- yet we know he
was using the nasal spray prior to
his death How do you think it got
there

JOANNE
I dont know

DULANEY
Isnt it true that you stopped by the
house after you left the drug store
and dropped off the items you bought

JOANNE
(nervously)
No

DULANEY
Isnt it true that you put the
cocaine in the bottle

JOANNE
No Why would I want to kill him
DULANEY
Because you were jealous Because he
cut you out of the will Because you
have a cocaine habit to feed --
because you know that if Rebecca
Lawson is found guilty the new will
is void -- and theres a very good
chance the old one would be honored

SILENCE fills the room Members of the JURY look at
Rebecca
they are confused -- doubt fills their minds

DULANEY
The defense rests

He grabs her and firmly pushes her down on the desk He

struggles against him His hands tear at her blouse It is
rough angry sex and it frightens Sharon

He slowly drops to his knees -- holding on to her as if she

were a strong tree in a wind-storm
DULANEY
Help me Please -- help me
INT COURTROOM - DAY
Dulaney sits beside Rebecca There is tension between them
does not look at her

JUDGE BURNHAM
Mr Dulaney

Dulaney stands and walks over to the jury

DULANEY
The Prosecutions case is built on
theory -- speculation Could Rebecca

Lawson have done this Is it
possible that she did that Where are

the facts The evidence The State
has presented two spurned lovers and
a jealous secretary Hardly what I
would call impartial witnesses

Where is one shred of conclusive
irrefutable evidence I dont see it
-- and I dont think you do either
Do you know why Because there isnt
any

(beat)
Whats the issue here That Rebecca
Lawson likes wild sex No But the
District Attorney is trying to make
you think if Rebecca Lawson could
stray from the path of normal
accepted sexual behavior then she
could be capable of murder Did she
force Andrew Marsh to make love to
her Did she hold a gun to his head

No Andrew Marsh wanted her -- and
why wouldnt he Shes beautiful
alluring -- the type of woman men

dream about

As Dulaney continues we sense he is applying his closing
arguments to himself

DULANEY
Its human nature We want what we
want -- when we want it We dont

think about the consequences of our
actions When desire fills us we all
do things that we know are bad for
us We live for the moment

(beat)
Here was an exciting young woman who
unlocked doors Doors that led into
a new world A world he entered
willingly -- eagerly He wanted to
please her -- and so he did not tell
her of his illness I know it might
be difficult for you to understand
wanting something so badly that you
are willing to risk everything -- but
thats what passion does to you
Its a fire -- uncontrollable It
consumes you -- and the only thing
you can do is let it burn Andrew

looks

stands

Marsh let it burn It was his life -
- his choice -- and maybe his mistake
-- but making love is not a crime
(beat)
We all have fires inside us -- secret
desires We guard them --hold them
in the cages that weve built When
someone comes along and opens the
gate they rush out and feed blindly
on their pleasure Rebecca Lawson
loved Andrew Marsh She didnt kill
him -- if anything did it was his
own passion

Dulaney walks back to his table and sits down
at him warmly Dulaney does not look at her

to address the jury

CARDENAS

Its true -- we all have fires
burning inside us Rebecca Lawson
was very aware of the fire burning
inside Andrew Marsh -- and she stoked
those flames -- fanning them until
they burned so hot that reason and
judgement left him Is making love a
crime Of course not -- but the
question isnt as simple as that
Rebecca Lawson used her seductive
qualities to entice Andrew Marsh
She used sex as a catalyst and
cocaine as the terminus The
combination of the two provided the
conclusion of a premeditated act

(beat)
She asked Dr Paley about cocaine
Her fingerprints were found on the
nasal spray bottle that contained the
cocaine -- and she was the sole
beneficiary of Andrew Marshs will
She planned it from beginning to end
She knew about his heart She
secretly administered cocaine then
used wild and physically demanding
sex to induce a heart attack

(beat)

Rebecca

Cardenas
Making love is an act of passion
between two people to affirm their
vows of love This was not an act of
love -- this was an act of greed
This was betrayal Rebecca Lawson
killed Andrew Marsh -- and Im
counting on you to punish her for
that crime

INT WAITING ROOM COURTHOUSE - DAY

Joanne steps out from behind a pillar She stares at

hatefully Her hand is inside her purse

That bastard should have left me
something I worked for him for six
years -- and he goes and gives it all
to her

Dulaney looks around the parking lot He is alone Joanne

obviously very high on something Her mind seems to wander

her eyes drift

JOANNE
You take what people say and make it
ugly You make others believe what
you want them to She should have
been found guilty She shouldnt
have gotten off

DULANEY
Then you would have gotten your
money

JOANNE
Yes

DULANEY
You killed him -- didnt you Joanne

Dulaney looks her hand fidgeting in her purse

DULANEY
What do you have in your purse

JOANNE
What do you think Ive got A gun
Maybe Im gonna kill you too Maybe
Ill blow your head off right now

Her hand starts to come out of the purse Suddenly Biggs

appears rushing her from behind a pillar He grabs her
hand

and pushes her against a car

He pulls her hand from the purse She is holding a piece of
paper

JOANNE
(crying)
Im gonna go to jail I know theyre
gonna make it look like I did it
They gotta put it on someone

DULANEY
Whyd you come here

JOANNE
(holds up the letter)
To show you this Its a letter from

that lawyer Koehler He wrote it to
me the day after I saw him Hes the
one who told me I could get the money
if Miss Lawson went to jail

DULANEY
You didnt know about it before that

JOANNE
No

Dulaney is suddenly very confused
DULANEY
Then why did you go see Mr Koehler

in the first place

JOANNE
Because he called me

DULANEY
Is it Joanne Braslow was perfect

problem After that the digging
should have been easy -- but we
missed the will You knew we were
following her so you called Koehler
and had him contact her That put us
right back on track All we needed
then was to prove that she had an
opportunity The drug store took
care of that She dropped off the
stuff and you came back and killed
him Didnt you

She shrugs her shoulders His frustration clearly amuses
her
She grins slightly almost taunting him

Paley struggles to make a decision The gun shakes in his
hand Suddenly the whole scheme becomes clear to Dulaney

DULANEY
Dont you see what shes doing She
needs you to kill me Shes planned
it that way from the start Thats
why she phoned me tonight
DR PALEY
You called him

REBECCA
No -- hes lying

DULANEY
Hows it supposed to work Rebecca
You and Paley celebrate your victory
You get me over here and provoke a
fight so he has to rush in and save

you -- but then hes given himself
away as your accomplice -- now he has
to kill me

(to Paley)

After that I figure shell tell the
Police that you broke in That you
were crazed because we humiliated you
in court

REBECCA
Dont listen to him Cant you see
hes trying to turn you against me

DULANEY

(continuing to

Paley)
Heres the good part The truth dies
with me and she turns States
evidence against you It wont
matter what you say No one will
believe your version -- youve
already discredited yourself in
court Youll go away forever and
shell have the money all for
herself Shes played us both
perfectly

Paley is becoming more and more confused Dulaney moves
towards him Paley lowers the gun slightly

REBECCA
Alan listen to me If you dont
kill him its over Everything we
did will be for nothing

DR PALEY
Shut up Rebecca

DULANEY
Shes good isnt she But maybe with
you its the real thing
(points to the
screen)
Im sure all those nights she was
fuckin me she was thinking of you

Confusion crowds Paleys mind

DULANEY
Im sure that every orgasm she had
with me was faked

DR PALEY
Thats enough

DULANEY
I mean she only screwed me two or
three times a night because she had
to -- Im sure she didnt enjoy it

REBECCA
(softly)
I love you Alan You have to
believe I love you Kill him Kill
him and we can be together forever

DULANEY
Thats right she loves you Just
like she loved Roston and Marsh and
me Dont be a fool Youre nothing
to her The second you pull that
trigger shell turn on you

Betrayal fills Paleys face His eyes fill with tears

DR PALEY
(to Rebecca)
I loved you

REBECCA
(tense)
Alan dont let him do this Youre
everything to me
(she moves closer)
as
He

he

off

body

over

Give me the gun Give me the gun and
Ill do it for you

Paley stares at her -- his mind races Pain fills his face
he fights to make a decision Suddenly his face tenses
starts to raise the gun at Dulaney -- then just as suddenly
turns it on Rebecca and FIRES

The bullet hits Rebecca in the chest The force blows her
her feet

Paley stares at her blankly He slowly lowers the gun and
drops it to the floor then staggers over to Rebecca

ON REBECCA
she stares up through glazed dead eyes
Paley takes her pulse He breaks down weeping over her

his tears signaling to Dulaney that she is dead

EXT REBECCAS HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

Police cars are lined up outside their RED LIGHTS FLASHING

INT REBECCAS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Members of the POLICE FORCE along with FORENSIC PEOPLE go
the area Dulaney sits on the couch He looks indifferent

as if all emotion has been sucked out of him Troxell is
beside him taking notes Dulaney looks up

A BODYBAG on a stretcher is being wheeled out of the room

Dulaney follows it with his eyes Cardenas enters from the
bedroom They lock eyes

CARDENAS
Paleys confessed to the whole thing
Its like hes got no will to live
now that shes gone

(thinks for a moment)
She almost got away with it Ironic
huh Do you believe in karma Frank

Dulaney doesnt answer
CARDENAS
Well -- call it what you want Fate
Destiny We usually get what we

deserve in the end

A beat Dulaney looks at him wearily

DULANEY
Can I go
CARDENAS
(to Troxell)

You get his statement

TROXELL
Yeah

CARDENAS
Then you can go

Dulaney gets up and starts for the door Cardenas watches

him
CARDENAS
Frank
Dulaney turns around slowly Cardenas reaches into his
RAINCOAT pocket and take out a VHS TAPE
CARDENAS
I found this video in her room It
has your name on it
The two men lock eyes There is a long silence between
them

Dulaney waits for Cardenas next move

CARDENAS
(holding it out)
I assume its yours

Dulaney knows that Cardenas has seen it A hint of a grateful
smile shows on his face He takes the tape

DULANEY
Thanks

EXT REBECCAS HOUSE - NIGHT

A light RAIN falls Dulaney walks out and heads towards the
street He stops -- looks back at the condo -- then walks down
the street towards his car

FADE TO BLACK
