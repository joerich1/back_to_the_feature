a steep climb revealing the fact that it
is carrying a small delta winged shuttle
on it back The bombers wings slide back

toward space
EXT SPACE-LOOKING BACK
We see a tiny glowing speck coming towards
us very quickly it gains in altitude and
we see that it is the shuttle Suddenly it
is upon us and blasts over our heads
ANGLE FROM BEHIND
We follow the shuttle The engine stops
There is a small explosion which pushes
the booster rocket away Small maneuvering

Behind and above the cockpit a large hatch
opens and a large circular spinning mirror
rises and locks into position

The pilot reaches above him and pulls down
a viewfinder and begins looking through
it

While still looking through the
viewfinder the pilot manipulates the
targeting controls

Crosshairs a grid patter and digital
rangefinder readouts appear over various
parts of the Earths topography as the
pilot searches for his target Then it
steadies on a polarized image of a group
of people One of the images seems to
stand out brighter than the others

EXT VILLA PATIO-DAY

The president and his aide are chatting
with a group of visiting dignitaries
There is a jovial atmosphere as they order
drinks from a waiter The president is
proudly displaying one of his medals to
his guests it has a very unique jewel-

EXT THE SHUTTLE
Dead silence then the mirror erupts in
brilliant light and sends an incredibly
bright beam toward the Earth Behind the
shuttle we see exhaust gases venting in
giant plumes into space
EXT VILLA PATIO
The beam strikes the president like the
finger of god He vaporizes The waiter
turns back with the asked-for sugar to
find a smoking hole where the President
once stood
EXT SPACE
The shuttle finishes its work and the beam
shuts down The mirror folds away and the
shuttle arcs across the screen preparing
for re-entry firing small retro rockets

In the middle of the room is a giant donut
of a round conference table Another
circle hangs above and casts light
downward in such a way as to light the
table-top but caser those sitting around
it in shadow We can see them but not
well There are SIX MEN in suits The look
is sinister as Hell but the talk is for
Rotary Club meeting
A MAN sitting at three oclock wearing
an Air force majors uniform points at a

stops the film The lighting does not
change he turns to the man sitting at
twelve oclock

CARMICHAEL
Nice little weapon isnt
it Dave
DECKER
Well I guess so but
gosh Don its a movie
You want me to start
buying weapons from
George Lucas
Polite laughter all around
CARMICHAEL
Now that would be
somethin wouldnt it
DECKER
Well sometimes I think I
might as well
(to one of the
others)
What do you think of what
you saw Roy
ROY
I think there werent
enough girls
More polite laughter Then Roy turns ice
cold in a flash
ROY (CONTD)
Is this thing for
biological targets only

CARMICHAEL
No Sir this thing would
take the skin right off
of Air Force One if you
wanted Not that Im
saying wed ever want to
kill our own President
but you know for
example

ROY
Our studies indicate that
this type of weapon is
totally useless for
warfare

DECKER
Its not intended for use
in your kind of warfare
Roy This is a perfect
peace time weapon

ROY
Whats the kill
potential

CARMICHAEL

As soon as the size-to
power ratio is licked
well have about seven
bangs for the buck

ROY
When that

Carmichael shrugs the sign for who
knows

DECKER
Seriously Don I have to
report to the Secretary
that everythings on
schedule We have plans
for your little rays gun
this summer

CARMICHAEL

(Trying to cover)

As I understand it guys
theres some major
practical difficulties
Im pushing as hard as I
can

DECKER
Well Don you tell those
geniuses youve got until
the end of the next
fiscal quarter to come up
with a working model or
Im pulling the plug on
the funding
CARMICHAEL
(very nervous)
Im assured theyre on
the verge of a major
breakthrough
DECKER
Good Just as long as we
get a working weapon out
of it by June Right
general
ROY
I wouldnt know Dave I
havent had a working
weapon since Korea
DECKER
Right

INT EXHIBITION HALL -DAY
WE OPEN on a sign Effects of marijuana
on Rodents A cage is divided in half
One side is marked NO Marijuana A
chinchilla is running furiously on a
treadmill The other side is marked

little hammock
DOLLY BACK TO WIDE SHOT We see we are in
a large hall There are dozens of booths
and exhibits A banner strung across the
hall lets us know that this is the
WESTERN REGIONAL HIGH SCHOOL WINTER
SCIENCE FAIR
ANGLE ON a pretty female student at a
booth standing in front of a clear glass
cylinder that has vacuum hoses connected
to it There are two colored gases inside
the cylinder A sign behind her says HOW
TORNADOS ARE FORMED A small group of
boys stand watching her in as sexist a way
as possible
GIRL
It doesnt seem to be
working but if it was
these gases would be
going around
A BOY

We dont care
ANGLE ON another part of the hall Two
blond-haired male twins stand proudly in
their booth THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL OF
HEAVENLY BODIES A large crudely painted
diorama of the Milky Way is in the
background Several painted balls are
suspended in front labeled Mercury
Venus etc The sun is represented by a
large electromagnet All the planets
ANGLE ON a booth near the entrance A
ROBOT attracts a crowd It has a video
screen for a face which reads Hi my
name is Harry Let me guess your weight
and age With jerky motions he extends
his mechanical arms and shakes hands with
passersby He is speaking to a small KID

The kid shoots it in the neck with a toy
space gun The ROBOT SHORT CIRCUITS
sparks shoot out its arms fly in circles
until a FUSE BLOWS and it SIZZLES to a
burning stop
WE PAN OVER TO the door just in time to
see the entrance of DR JERRY ATHERTON
professor of physics at Pacific Tech and
a popular host of a PBS television show
about science His manner and bearing mark
him as a classic anal retentive He is a
perfect cross between Carl Sagan and Jerry
Brown Brilliant intense seemingly
sincere but in fact incredibly
manipulative There is an intentional aura
of superiority surrounding him
We FOLLOW him in and down an aisle where
he draws the attention of the crowd in the
manner of the celebrity he is An OLD LADY
stops him He beams a smile at her

OLD LADY
Are you Dr Atherton

ATHERTON
Yes dear

OLD LADY

I just love your

television show
ATHERTON

Well thank you We try
OLD LADY
Whats Albert Einstein
really like

ATHERTON
Dead

OLD LADY
Oh I thought you had him
on

ATHERTON
No that was just an
actor

OLD LADY
Is everyone an actor
then

ATHERTON

(beginning to
tire of this)
No Im a physicist
OLD LADY
But Einstein isnt
ATHERTON
(dismissing her)
Nice talking to you
He walks away
ANGLE ON a booth where we meet MITCH
SIMON aged fifteen Mitch is a genius
Hes known that since he was old enough to
understand the word which was on his
first birthday He was doing college level
work by the time he was in the fourth
grade Although hes intellectually
precocious hes still only 15 years old
and has all the problems of any average
adolescent His shyness and intellect have
always made him feel different and
uncomfortable in social situations
He stands with his PARENTS near a
demonstration table Unlike some of the
other exhibits weve seen there is
nothing amateurish about this one In
fact it is an impressive display of a dye
laser We can see the beams of multi-
colored rays bouncing between mirrors
moving through liquids combining with
gases
MITCH is trying to explain his work to MR
SIMON who is a nice enough guy but who
pretty much regards the fact that his son
is gifted as a pain in the butt
MITCH
See Dad its coherent
light

ATHERTON APPROACHES

SIMON

MR S
It talks

MITCH

No

who greets him

IMON

MRS SIMO
Dr ATHERTON what a
surprise

ATHERTON
Hello Mrs Simon How
are you

MR SIMON

He is seen by MRS

N

No problem with Mitchs
test scores or anything

is there

ATHERTON
No no I just thought

Id stop by bring
the good news myse

you
lf

just got word from the

admissions committ
did it Mitch is i
MRS

ee
n
SIMO

Isnt that wonderful
ATHERTON

(to Mitch)
Hello Mitch

MITCH

(shyly)
Hi

ATHERTON

Nice little displa

MITCH

Thanks

y

ATHERTON
Whats your medium

MITCH

I

We

N

Just Argon But I have it
all structured for HF if

I could get some

ATHERTON

That would be
interesting

MITCH

Its all theoretical at

this stage but I
the power supply
completely worked

have

out

ATHERTON

Very nice

MITCH
ATHERTON

(a kid again)
Thanks
turns to Mitchs parents
ATHERTON
You must be very proud
hes the first student
weve ever accepted for
winter term entrance at
Pacific Tech
MR SIMON
I image hes the
youngest too
ATHERTON
No actually The
youngest weve had was a
twelve but he cracked
under the pressure within
six months so we dont
really count him
MRS SIMON
(almost in tears)
Fifteen year old and off
to college Image
MR SIMON
Listen Doc This
scholarship thing does
he get any kind of whatya
call it signing bonus
sort of thing
ATHERTON
(hoping this is
not going to be a
problem)
Well nobut by
allowing Mitch to
progress at an
accelerated rate we give
him the opportunity to
fulfill a far greater
portion of his remarkable
intellectual potential
Dont you agree
MR SIMON
Yeah I guess Its just
that athletes get you
know cars and stuff
ATHERTON
(polite for
Mitchs sake)
Well I guess we
scientists are a little
different than athletes

MR SIMON
Cheaper

ATHERTON
Smarter

MR SIMON
Not when it comes to
getting cars

MRS SIMON
We just want the best for
Mitchie

(changing gears)

Dr Atherton I saw your
show the other night
about radioactive
isotopes and I have a
question for you

ATHERTON
Oh yes
MRS SIMON
Is that your real hair
MR SIMON
Well I wondered that
too
ATHERTON
(struggling for
manners)

Well interesting
question when you
consider the
philosophical aspects of
whether anything on
television is real or
actually just an image
being broadcast

MR SIMON
Didnt look real Anyway
listen I got to get
something to eat or Im
gonna die

MRS SIMON
Come on lets look for
something

They start away

MRS SIMON (CONTD)
I saw over there one of
the kids was doing an
experiment with insect
protein

MR SIMON
Did you see anyone doing
anything with corned
beef
They exit
ATHERTON
Your parents
MITCH
Yes
ATHERTON
Theyrenice
MITCH
Theyre Okay They just
sometimes dont have any
idea of what Im talking
about

ATHERTON
Im sure of that Afraid
youre going to miss your
friends
MITCH
No I dont have any I
think I intimidate other

kids
ATHERTON
Good boy
MITCH
dont want to
ATHERTON

Remember compared to
you most people have the
Q of a carrot Were
different than most
people Mitch but you
should be proud of that
mean look around From
now on youll BE amongst
peers colleagues I
suppose I might as well
tell you now Ive put
you on my personal
research team Some of
the finest minds on
campus not the least of
which is of course my

own
MITCH

It sounds great
ATHERTON

Well now Im expecting
great things from you my
boy This is only the
second time Ive given
this honor to a freshman
The first was

MITCH
Chris Kinsley
ATHERTON

You know Chris
MITCH
No but hes a legend in
the Physics Club
ATHERTON
Well youre going to
become a legend yourself
Youll be working with
Chris Hes a senior now
but hes still on the
team and still as
brilliant as ever
MITCH

Wow

this Disneyland of Science is a well-
dressed executive ROBERT JENSEN who is
guiding Chris on the tour Chris was
heralded as one of the smartest people to
ever enter Pacific Tech He proved to be
even smarter than many of his professors
He also proved to be one of the most
outrageous people to ever enter Pacific
Tech his antics are legend Unimpressed
with authority pomposity and bullshit in

of life Currently hes wearing a sports
jacket thats seen better days over a
faded sweatshirt that has the logo I

EXT PACIFIC TECH CAMPUS-DAY
It is an impressive campus of older
California Spanish building mixed with
modern architectural marvels This is the
Sunday before the beginning of the Winter
Term
We pick up MITCH SIMON and FOLLOW him as
he crosses campus He is wearing a tie and
jacket which only adds to his general
sense of being out of place He is
carrying a map which he stops to consult
every now and again He stops an upper
classman and asks him a question while
pointing at the map The older asks him a
question while pointing at the map The
older student takes great delight in
turning the map right side up
EXT PRESIDENTS HOUSE-AFTERNOON
The tasteful and elegant official
residence of the universitys President
DR EUGENE MEREDITH MITCH approaches the
open front door where he is greeted by
MRS MEREDITH
MITCH
Good afternoon Im
looking for

invitation in his
hand)
the Presidents Freshman
Tea
MRS MEREDITH
(leading him
inside)
Oh good Im so glad we
have one then Who are
you
INT THE HOUSE-CONTINOUS
They pass through on their way to the
backyard
MITCH
Mitch Simon
MRS MEREDITH
Oh yes Youre the
special case know Gene
wants to meet you Youre
just in time for his
traditional talk Would
you like a glass of
sherry

MITCH
Im a minor

MRS MEREDITH

Aha well of course you
are That would explain
your height

They exit out onto the patio

EXT THE PATIO AND GROUNDS OF THE HOUSE-

CONTINUOUS

The returning freshman class has gathered
for a social Mitch is the only one ina
tie He stands on the patio with Mrs
Meredith whose husband the apparently

ever-jovial professional academic

administrator is about to speak to the

assembled
MEREDITH

People if I might get

your attention

The din begins to quiet

MEREDITH (CONTD)

Welcome back freshmen I
take it you all put the
Christmas break to good
use

There is good-natured jeering

MEREDITH (CONTD)

Now if youll indulge
me Id like to speak
seriously for a moment
You will recall that when
I welcomed you to the
Pacific institute of
Technology a few short
months ago I spoke of how
we are one of the finest
scientific institutions
in the world I think the
finest I mentioned our
six Nobel Prize winners
our members of the
national Academy of
Sciences and our members
of the National Academy
of Engineering This is
an intellectual oasis of
technological achievement
in the dessert of general
academic mediocrity we
see inmost colleges and
universities today

There is some applause and good-natured

banter Mitch is truly moved This
environment is exactly what Mitch has
hoped for all his life
MEREDITH (CONTD)
I also spoke of the fact
that you are the finest
freshmen class we have
ever had here
There are cheers and applause
MEREDITH (CONTD)
I say this to every
freshman class Each year
we raise our entrance
requirements and each
year there is a group of
students like you who
meet and surpass those
requirements
Almost jubilant cheering and clapping
MEREDITH (CONTD)
As you have no doubt
already noticed by now
over a third of you are
gone By the end of the
year another third of you
will have followed them
out of Eden and into
mediocrity
The crowd goes deathly silent as Meredith
continues in his cherry manner
MEREDITH (CONTD)
We want only the best
Hard work and high
standards are expected of
everyone And if you
arent up to it Cal tech
or MIT might take you
but you dont fit in
here
MEREDITH (CONTD)
Let me remind you that
this place is an
opportunity not a right
a chance not a gift a
working lunch not a
picnic Welcome back
Several waitresses begin serving tea but
the despair of reality creeps over the
students and they begin to disperse Mitch
stands waiting for the approaching Dr
Meredith
MRS MEREDITH
Gene this is Mitch
Simon

MEREDITH
Oh yes Professor
Arthertons bright star

MITCH
Yes sir

MEREDITH
And I understand youre
already on his project
Im assured youre going
to do great things

MITCH
I hope so
MEREDITH
Let me give you some
advice
MITCH
Thank you
MEREDITH
Dont screw up
MITCH
Okay I guess I better go
now
He walks away
MEREDITH
(watching Mitch
with
satisfaction)

I think the young people

really appreciate my

getting down verbally

dont you

MRS MEREDITH

Absolutely
EXT CAMPUS-LATER
Once again Mitch map in hand must ask
another student for directions This one
also turns the map right-side up and then
points to the building they are standing
in front of As he heads for it he passes
a bronze bust of one of the founding
fathers DR BRADFORD The students have
decorated him with a muffler earmuffs and
carrot nose to look like a snowman
INT APPLIED PHYSICS BUILDING-MOMENTS LATER
Mitch walks down a long corridor He
passes several open doors that reveal
laboratories with all kinds of scientific
equipment all over them
Mitch stops in front of a closed door He
checks the number then looks down at a

card in his hand He turns the card right-
side up He OPENS the door to REVEAL a
darkened lab In the darkness there is a
veritable light show of laser beams A
voice calls out from the darkness

VOICE (OC)
Hey

MITCH
Yes

VOICE (OC)

Come in here
INT LAB-CONTINUOUS
Mitch ENTERS quickly and shuts the door
behind himself In the instrument glow we
can make out the forms of three other
students They are KENT CARTER and
BODIE members of Dr Athertons research
team

KENT
Just leave the sandwiches
and go
MITCH
Me
KENT
No Yoda yeah you
MITCH
I dont have any ah
CARTER
Brains
MITCH
No sandwiches
KENT
Well then what good are
you
CARTER
What are we supposed to
eat
MITCH
(getting a little
fed up)
How about my shorts
KENT

Hey Who do you think

youre talking to
The laser snaps off and the lights snap
on The glare is a little intense at
first

KENT (CONTD)

Are you from the

restaurant or not
With the lights on we get a chance to have
a better look at the team Kent is an
elitist

intellectual snob with very

little imagination who likes to think of
himself as Athertons protg He wears
braces on his teeth because he knows how
important a proper smile can be in the

marketplace

MITCH
No Im Mitch Simon Im
a student Dr Atherton
told me to come up here
KENT
Oh youre the new stud
are you Or is it dud
MITCH
How do you mean
BODIE
Stud Hot shot Brain
Youre the twelve-year-
old right
MITCH
Im fifteen
CARTER
Does your body know that

Mitch attempts a good-natured laugh
not a great attempt

They all

No Thank God

MITCH

Are you expecting him

or

KENT
Sure Can I get you
something A balloon

MITCH
Are any of you guys Chris
Kinsley
freeze

KENT

CARTER
Hey Kent I hear Kinsley
got that PEI job all

locked up
KENT

Damn I wanted that job
MITCH

Why
KENT

Why Because it starts at

fifty thousand a year
thats why Plus travel

car stock options

MITCH

Its
Oh Well Im supposed to
have a look at your work
up to date Check it

over
KENT
Check it over
MITCH
Yes
KENT
For what
MITCH

Mistakes I guess He
said you guys are stuck
The room goes rigid Evidently this little
punk of an upstart needs to be told what
Christ died for
KENT
Lets get something very
clear here Everything
youve heard about the
supportive student body
and the honor code might
hold for the rest of the
campus but it doesnt
count for squat in here
Which means when jerrys
not here you do what I
say From God to Jerry to
me get it
Atherton ENTERS
KENT (CONTD)
Hi Jerry
ATHERTON
Ive told you before
Kent you dont get to
use my first name
KENT
Did I
ATHERTON
(to Mitch)
Good to see you Mitch
ATHERTON (CONTD)
(to the group)

Im sorry he isnt here
I wanted you to meet your

hero

CARTER
Hero That clown Look at
this

He points to a table full of laser
equipment comprised of various angled
mirrors and gas cambers and drib units
The others gather around it
CARTER (CONTD)
We heard he wasnt coming
in Kent and I figured
wed go ahead and run his
section without him And
we started getting
picosecond ratings that
arent even in the
ballpark
KENT
It looks like itll take
at least a week to re-do
all this and start again
Mitch is carefully studying the equipment
and checking some notes that were on the
table
KENT (CONTD)
Another costly mistake
ATHERTON
Are you sure
CARTER
Positive
KENT
Positive
MITCH
(reading from
notes)
Negative
(innocently to
Carter and Kent)
Theres a mistake all
right but I think you
guys made it Look you
inverted the last two
steps
CARTER
(grabbing the
notes)
I dont make mistakes
(reading)
Usually
ATHERTON
Damnit dont touch other
peoples things
MITCH
(adjusting the
equipment)
This shouldnt take too
long to fix
ATHERTON
Im glad that you were
here Mitch
KENT
Yes thanks for pointing
out Carters mistake
Mitch

ATHERTON
Dont bother with that
now Im sure you want to
go get settled

MITCH
(relieved)
Well it has been kind of
a long day
Atherton starts to leave
ATHERTON
Oh I forgot Kent I need
your help
ENT

ATHERTON
Stop it
ENT

ATHERTON
(to Mitch)
Shall we
MITCH

Atherton exits followed by Mitch
BODIE

I guess it goes from God

to Jerry to you to the

cleaners right Kent
EXT DORM HALL- LATE AFTERNOON
Mitch enters the arched column portico of
this dormitory building
INT ROOM
The room is small cramped and more than
a little disheveled PEI NASA and science
fiction posters hang on the ceiling and
wall over and around one of the two beds
Junk food and soft drink containers are
littered everywhere In one corner is a
fully-stocked Frito Lay Chip display
Mitch crosses to his bed and sits He is
exhausted and depressed The door opens
and Mitch see a strange tall bulkily-
built hermit-looking kind of a guy enter
He is carrying a McDonalds bag He stops
when he see Mitch and stares at him ina
quirky way for a second then crosses to
the closet opens the door and exits into
it
MITCH
Hello
Getting no response Mitch rises goes to
the closet opens it and looks in
MITCH
Hello
There is no one there
MITCH
What kind of place is
this
Mitch crosses to his luggage he opens a
bag and to his surprise he finds it
empty he then looks in the other bag and
find theyve all been cleaned out
Puzzled he shuts the bags
Suddenly the door swings open and CHRIS
KINSLEY who we saw earlier at PEI
ENTERS Hes dragging a large piece of
mechanical equipment it is in fact a
baseball pitching machine
CHRIS

Hi
Mitch stares
CHRIS (CONTD)
Hey you just gonna sit

bat
MITCH

ball smashes through the window
CHRIS

wall
CHRIS (CONTD)

Kinsley
MITCH
Oh no
INT MOVING CAR- SAME TIME
Dr Atherton is riding in a rental car
with DON CARMICHAEL a government contract
monitor These two guys are part of an old
boy network involved with research and
development

CARMICHAEL
Were falling way behind
Jer

ATHERTON

Well were not making
cheese sandwiches here
you know Don
CARMICHAEL
Thats a good one Ill
have to remember to use

that Jer
ATHERTON
The new boy is quick
CARMICHAEL

He better be because the
company needs a practical
working model within four

months

ATHERTON
You cant dictate
innovation

CARMICHAEL

Let me put this another
way Jer You know all
that money weve been
spending for development
ATHERTON
Yes
CARMICHAEL
Well when a project gets
cut off the finance boys
always run an audit
ATHERTON
I see
The car pulls up to Athertons house
where there is a great deal of
construction going on Once the work is
completed this is going to be beautifully
restored rather large Victorian home
CARMICHAEL
(looking out)
Having a little work done
on the old place are
you Looks nice
INT MITCHS ROOM-THAT NIGHT
Mitch is gathering up some books He looks
at a chart on the wall
MITCH

Library library205
The door to the room opens while Mitch is
looking the other way We catch a glimpse
of the same tall bulkily-built man
opening Mitchs closet door and
disappearing inside Mitch turns just in
time to see the door close he goes into
it opens it and looks inside Nothing he
goes to the door of his room Mitch opens
the door steps into the hall and slips
landing on his ass His books go flying
INT HALLWAY
The hall floor is covered with ice wall-
to-wall Skating MUSIC is playing ona
cassette somewhere A few students
dressed for winter are skating Chris
skates over and helps Mitch to his feet

CHRIS

Welcome to Pacific Techs

Smart People On Ice
He whirls away leaping from wall to wall
sliding quickly down the ice He stops in
front of a short roly-poly kid of
Japanese descent MARK ICKAGAMI better
know as ICK Ick is a bio-chemist who
spends a great deal of time in his lab
experimenting with various fun compounds
that do things ranging from making
artificial ice to increasing memory

CHRIS
(with a
proletariat
accent)
Ice turned out real good
Ick
ICK
Yeah it worked didnt

MITCH

smart

ICK
I dont know how smart he
is Before he even came
here he invented a solar
battery which laid the
groundwork for the system
that provides the energy
for Amarillo at half the
cost Hed be a
millionaire today if he

As she races off KENT enters carrying
several binders
KENT
Whats all this suppose

CHRIS
This This is new kind of
shovel
Mitch finds this very funny and reacts
accordingly by laughing
Kent cant stand to be laughed at
KENT
(Dumping the
binders into
Mitchs hands)
This should keep you busy
for awhile This plus
your regular class load
should turn your brains
to mush in a month
MITCH
Aw Kent we were going

KENT
(impressed by
this fairly
uncommon
phenomenon)

rare and very unstable

KENT
Youre all a bunch of
degenerates

CHRIS

Mitch)
Mighty mouse here beat

MITCH
(uncomfortable
unsure if this is
real)
Wellno I mean
CHRIS
Hey Maybe you are
smarter than me but can

Chris pushes himself off backwards and
slides along the ice in an attempt ata
fancy figure skating move Just as hes
about to finish he crashes to the floor at
the precise moment that the floor turns
into a cloud of rising gas Chris
disappears in the cloud
ICK
(excited)
It worked
MITCH
Thats neat
ICK
(teasing)
Now if we can just keep
it from exploding
Kent runs away
CHRIS
(from inside the
growing cloud)
Hey Ick Is it okay to
breathe this stuff
(beat)
Ick
(beat)
Ick
The cloud fills the screen
NT CHRIS AND MITCHS ROOM-THE NEXT MORNING
Perfect morning light streams through the
window making even this dump look
beautiful Chris is asleep in a strange
position on his bed proving that even
asleep he is eccentric We Pan across the
room to Mitch He has obviously fallen
asleep while reading the binders that Kent
had given him the night before We HEAR
the sound of the door opening followed by
some heavy footsteps This causes Mitch to
wake up it takes him a second to realize
where he is He sits up
MITCHS POV

Again we catch just a glimpse of that same
mysterious figure opening the closet door
He is holding a McDonalds bag He
closes the door behind him
ANGLE ON MITCH
To say the least hes thrown by this
strange intrusion
MITCH
Hello
He waits a beat listening Nothing
happens so he gets up and crosses to the
closet looks inside
OVER MITCHS SHOULDER INTO CLOSET
Theres nothing in there but clothes
Mitch pushes the garments aside and finds
just a wall
ANGLE ON MITCH
He shakes his head This is getting
frustrating He exits the room
INT BATHROOM
Mitch crosses to the urinal Just as he is
about to relieve himself the door opens
Jordan enters This is an experience Mitch
has never before and as a result he is one
uncomfortable fifteen-year-old
JORDAN
Hi good morning I

earlier riser we met

sweater
She holds out a sweater He leans into the
urinal trying to hide himself the best he
can
MITCH
Last night
JORDAN

She exits
MITCH
(stunned)

INT THE LOBBY AREA OF THE DORM- A LITTLE LATER
Mitch is coming down a hallway into the
area He is dressed in his tie and jacket
and has books under his arm As he crosses
past the self-serve vending machine he
spots Chris entering the kitchen Mitch
follows him inside
MITCH
Something strange
happened to me this
morning
CHRIS
Was it a dream where you
see yourself dressed up
in kind of sun god robes
standing on top of a
pyramid with all theses
nude women throwing
little pickles at you
MITCH
No
CHRIS
Why am I the only person
who has that dream
Before Mitch can ask another question
hris open the freezer compartment and
akes out a large thermos-like container
e takes it over to the cutting board
hen takes from his pocket a pair of
alipers a pair of tweezers and a little
ox that looks like a dental floss kit He
pens the container which immediately
tarts pouring thick steam
MITCH
Liquid nitrogen
Chris uses calipers to extract a length of
tubing from inside the container he puts
it down on the board and using the
tweezers pushing out a cylindrical mound
of ice from inside the tube Then from
the dental floss kit he pulls out a
length of very fine wire which he uses to
cut the ice into a number of thin coins
and slides then into the lid of the
container which he picks up and takes out
the door with him Mitch follows

INT VENDING MACHINE AREA
CHRIS
Coffee
Using the tweezers Chris picks up an ice
coin and puts it into one of the machines
There is a high-pitched squeak To Mitchs
astonishment the machine accepts the
bogus money and a cup drops down and fills
with coffee
CHRIS
So whats happened
MITCH
Oh Theres a guy living
in our closet
CHRIS
Youve seen him too
Chris puts his coins in several of the
machines and retrieves from them junk food
junkys treasure trove of goodies

MITCH
Who is it

CHRIS
Hopsfield

MITCH
Is he safe

CHRIS
So far

Chris exits Mitch stares after him
SCHOOL MONTAGE

A quick series of shots moves us through
the next two months of time accompanied
by an original song

INT LECTURE HALL-DAY

An older professor is lecturing pointing
to a complicated algebraic problem on a
blackboard Mitch is in the last row of
this student-filled multi-tiered
classroom Everyone else listens intently
and makes notes while Mitch thumbs quickly
through a textbook then closes it and
makes a note in a loose-leaf binder

INT ATOM SMASHER ROOM-DAY

Mitch stands with a group of other
students watching an instructor explain
the intricacies of nuclear fission Mitch
opens a notebook and starts writing
furiously

INT ATHERTONS PROJECT LAB-DAY

Mitch is using his notes and some pieces
of equipment to explain something to the
rest of the team Chris is impressed Kent
shakes his head in disagreement until
Atherton nods his approval at which point
Kent also agrees

INT CHRIS AND MITCHS ROOM-NIGHT

it is late but Mitch is still hard at the
books Hopsfield goes by and disappears in
the closet Mitch doesnt even notice
anymore There is a knock at the door and
Jordan enters She has brought Mitch a
device that she just built which holds
textbooks and turns the pages
automatically

INT LECTURE HALL-DAY

Mitch dressed more informally is in the
same room with the same professor as in
scene 54 This time however there are
several empty seats The people have been
replaced by cassette tape recorders Mitch
takes notes
INT CHEMICAL ENGINEERING LAB-DAY

Mitch enters with another student to find
a teddy bear waiting for him at his place
INT ATHERTONS LAB-NIGHT
Mitch and Chris work alone it is
obviously very late Using a variety of
exotic-looking devices they put the laser
through its paces and make notes

NT LECTRURE HALL-DAY

This time Mitch is the only student Tape
recorders sit in front of every seat The
professor drones on apparently oblivious
to what he sees in front of him

NT WAVE TANK ROOM-DAY

A very attractive instructress is
demonstrating a dye trace experiment ina
huge wave tank Mitch takes notes

NT DINING HALL

Mitch and Ick are carrying trays of food
looking for a place to sit They pass a
seated Kent who points out a place for
Mitch who looks to see a highchair at the
end of the table

EXT LIBRARY-MORNING

Mitch comes down the stairs with several
books under his arms He stumbles and
drops one of the books As he struggles to
recover it it is handed to him by none
other than Hopsfield By the time Mitch
realizes who it is the mysterious figure
is once again gone

EXT STREET-DAY

Mitch is crossing the street carrying a
huge load of books Suddenly a yellow

Citroen pulls up behind him and honks its
horn causing Mitch to drop everything He
looks at the driver and sees that it is a
laughing Kent

INT ATHERTONS CLASSROOM

Chris Kent Bodie and Carter are present
as Atherton wraps up a days class People
take serious notes Chris reads a
magazine People file out and Mitch enters
approaches Chris to get him to work on the
laser Chris shakes his head

INT ATHERTONS LAB-LATE NIGHT

Mitch is working alone He adjusts the
laser and turns it on It burns through a
very thick block of wood but Mitch is
still not pleased

INT HALLWAY-NEXT MORNING

A very tired Mitch heads for the lecture
hall He comes to the door opens it and
enters to see a tape recorder lecturing to
a roomful of tape recorders

INT CHRIS AND MITCHS ROOM-ANOTHER NIGHT
In need of a break from studying Mitch
goes to the closet in hopes of figuring
out how to open the wall

He examines the walls and the floor and
looks for hidden switches or secret
mechanisms all to no avail As hes about
to give up the closet door swings closed
When it closes the wall opens to reveal a
small elevator-like cage Mitch steps in
and the cage descends It hits a lever and
stops But before Mitch steps in and the
can get off it begins to move sideways
triggering another pulley and goes down
again into the steam tunnels then drags
along the floor and stops Mitch gets out
Its spooky In the distance there is a
glow of light

Mitch goes forward until he can see the
home of Hopsfield Its a very utilitarian
example of life on the edge with all the
comforts At the console of an amazing
hand-built computer sits amazing
Hopsfield Mitch watches in awe from the
darkness

INT ATHERTONS LAB-DAY

There is an experiment in progress A
large laser is building up an energy load
Atherton Kent Bodie Carter and Mitch
monitor various pieces of equipment
Things hum and click and there is a sense

that something big is going to happen

Atherton seems pleased

troubled Suddenly

while Mitch seems
a valve blows anda

stream of liquid nitrogen hisses froma

hose spewing frost

over everything

Everyone jumps for switches and they shut

the experiment down

(checking the
valve)

Its nothing

Mitch goes next door Chris meanwhile
measures a certain distant from the floor
and mounts a mirror on the wall above his
head He then moves to the laser and
repositions it to shoot at the mirror
Mitch returns and makes some adjustments
to a control panel

charge
Suddenly there is a loud crack and the
laser sends out a beam across the room
bouncing off the mirror on the wall out
the door where it hits another mirror and
disappears from sight

MITCH

Wow
EXT THE CAMPUS-CONTINUOUS
The beam has formed a web of light across
the darkened campus The effect is quite
spectacular People look in awe Chris and
Mitch exit the physics building

CHRIS
Follow the yellow brick
road

MITCH

Have you ever considered

the fact that you are

completely wasting your

life

CHRIS

Constantly
The lights on campus come back on as Chris
and Mitch continue to follow the beam
NT WAVE TANK BUILDING
An open window above the door lets the
beam of light enter Chris and Mitch
enter
NT HALLWAY-CONTINUOUS
Chris and Mitch walk down a stairway
through an open door following the beam
NT WAVE TANK ROOM-CONTINUOUS
The place has been turned into an indoor
Waikiki The beam has been directed into a
hood-shaped device that has split it into
enough rays to cook a bunch of hot dogs
and hamburgers on an improvised barbeque

beach and wearing a welding mask
Past him we can see that there about
twenty girls and some guys present
Several of them are water-skiing on the
mechanically produced waves inside the
tank towed by an elaborated pulleys
system Others are frolicking on the
beach and cut out palms stand around
achieving the desired effect Blankets
have been laid out and girls sit on them
eating hot dogs and talking There are sun
lamps set up in one area and some kids are
smoothing sun tan oil and shagging a few
rays Rock music fills the room

not feel adequately

prepared

CORNELL
Thanks

MILTON

What if we end up having

too much fun and end up

failing
CHRIS

And would that be the end

of the world Milton
MILTON

Yes it would
CHRIS

Yeah youre right Maybe

you should go back to the

look for a minute

girls most of them can
find guys a lot better
than you

CORNELL
Oh easily

CHRIS
These girls are not used
to geniuses You might
impress them

CORNELL
I dont see how

CHRIS
Let me put this another

way Given the type of

people you are and the

environment youre in

you guys have to admit

the strong probability

that this may be the only

chance youll ever get in

your entire lives to have

sex
There is a pause while everyone considers
the hypothesis

CHRIS (CONTD)

Think about it
He turns and heads into the party After a
beat everyone except Mitch follows

CHRIS
They called me Chris the
whiss
MITCH
Really Whats a whiss
CHRIS

I think they meant wuss
but it didnt
rhymewhen I was three
years old I balanced my
fathers checkbook so
they sent me to school
and fired their
accountant My father was
so intimidated he
stopped speaking to me
My teacher disliked me
because I was smarter
than they were and my
classmates hated me
because I bell the bell
curve Sound familiar
And tell me why mywhy
did my mother dress me in
white shirts hush
puppies and a briefcase
guaranteeing that a girl
would never talk to me
Mitch looks down at his own white shirt
and hush puppies
MITCH
YOU
CHRIS
(Dramatic)

CHRIS
(Lighter but
sincere)

And I talk to the guy
Turned out that in the
Seventies he was the
number one stud around
here Smarter than you

brilliant so sharp so
advanced so long

MITCH
What do you mean

CHRIS
He graduated Went to
work for some chemical
company One day someone
told him he was making
stuff that was killing
people I think it was
his mother He freaked
You see he was totally
unprepared for the real
world He had no
philosophy He thought
science was the answer
for everything

MITCH
Am I gonna wind up ina
steam tunnel
CHRIS
Yes you are
Metaphorically speaking
Unless you see that the
same thing that has made
your life miserable can
make it great your
brain When youre smart
people need you and you
can learn how to work
that for fun and profit
MITCH
You had a arrangement
going with Atherton
dont you Thats why you
dont have to study
CHRIS
Hey I dont carry a
briefcase

Youre a nice kid If you

Atherton storms out
INT CLASSROOM
Atherton enters like a dark cloud
at his desk
ANGLE ON CHRIS
He finishes his last question He
of his seat
ANGLE ON ATHERTON
Sitting at his desk Chris places
on the desk Atherton looks up
ANGLE ON CHRIS AND ATHERTON
Chris has a big grin on his face
a piece of paper and writes on it
slides it in front of Atherton
INSERT

He sits

He takes
and then

The piece of paper It says I aced

ANGLE ON ATHERTON

He writes a message and slides it

He exits Atherton tosses the apple in the

wastebasket The APPLE EXPLODES
EXT CAMPUS-DAY
Chris is heading for the lab The

place

has that look of exam period desertion

CHRIS
(muttering to
himself)
Okie-dokie doc a house
doesnt have to fall on
ole Chris Kinsley
INT ANTHERTONS LAB-DAY
Chris enters and prepares to test the new
equipment He aligns the secondary laser
and let it charge up He makes some final
checks and then throws a switch The laser
fires for an instant but then seems to go
crazy The new laser overheats and the
main chamber sparks and smokes Chris
tries to shut it down but to now avail he
tears the cover off in hopes of pulling
the wiring but hes too late We see
everything melting away as the machine
eats itself We also see a message left
for Chris just before it too melts It
reads 1 laserlcar Chris is on the
verge of a complete mental collapse as he
watches his work go up in smoke
CHRIS
(in anguish)
No
There is nothing but the echo of his voice
in response The main laser stands like a
huge frozen bird in the empty room In
anger and frustration he swears at the
machine
CHRIS (CONTD)
You bastard This is your
fault
He kicks the wastepaper basket in hopes of
getting rid of some of this anger but
instead all he gets is the basket
bouncing back and hitting him in the shin
CHRIS (CONTD)
Shit I deserve that It
all comes back on you in
the end
He suddenly stands up straight as though
he were having a stroke
CHRIS (CONTD)
Holy shit
Inspiration takes hold and Chris begins
running around like a madman gathering up
parts to the laser
CHRIS (CONTD)
(almost singing
hes so happy)
Of course its so
simple Echoes bouncing
back at me and you
EXT DORM-A LITTLE LATER
Chris runs up the stairs three at a time
INT CHRIS AND MITCHS ROOM
He bursts in
CHRIS
Mitch
The room is empty
The closet door opens and Hopsfield steps
out carrying another box of cards
CHRIS (CONTD)
Laslo Buddy Have you
seen Mitch

HOPSFIELD
No How did you do
CHRIS
(elated)
I failed
HOPSFIELD
You shouldnt have
CHRIS

Thats true But never

mind that now It came to

me The power problem I

solved it Echoes Its

so simple four little

mirrors It bounces back

and supercharges the gas

itself Ive got to find

Mitch to help me build it

but it should increase

the power ten-fold at

least If you see him

tell him to meet me at

the lab Bye
Chris exits leaving Hopsfield lost in
thought
EXT STUDENT UNION-MOMENTS LATER
A hand-painted sign hangs over the door
that says Exam Week Decompression Here
Chris runs in the door
INT DECOMPRESSION ROOM-CONTINUOUS
The room is full of students who are
blowing off steam from studying for and
taking exams They are engaged in all
sorts of silly mindless activities
ranging from tiddly-winks and video games
to watching cartoons There are supplies
of brain food and health drinks around

Mitch Ick and Jordan are in the corner
Chris runs up to them
JORDAN
Oh Chris How did it go
CHRIS
Great It was a snap But
Atherton said hes
failing me anyway
JORDAN
Thats terrible You must
be feeling awful Are you
all right
CHRIS
Thank you Jordan I do
feel terrible but I cant
talk about it right now
I need Mitch Gotta go
Bye
He grabs Mitch and pulls him out
ICK
He seems to be handling
it all right SRS5FADE OUT
EXT ATHERTONS HOUSE-LATER THAT NIGHT
Chris knocks on the front door Atherton
answers the door He is less than thrilled
to see Chris
INT ATHERTONS HOUSE

CHRIS
(forcing his way
in)
Hiya Jerry hows it
going
ATHERTON
What do you want Kinsley
CHRIS

World peace but I dont
think this is the time to
discuss it

ATHERTON
What are you doing here
Ive already told you
youve burned out and
youve failed me and
yourself miserably

CHRIS
Yes I know that But I
thought you might be
interested

ATHERTON
Im not interested in
anything you have to say
Just then a pretty COED starts to come
down the stairs She is dressed only in
one of Athertons shirts
COED
Jerry
CHRIS
I solved the power
problem Jerry
Atherton pauses He looks at Chris then
the girl
ATHERTON
Debbie go home
INT ATHERTONS LAB-LATER THAT NIGHT
Atherton Kent Bodie and Carter stand by
the laser as Chris explains what hes done
with formulas on the blackboard
CHRIS
As you know I was
working on supercharging
the DF by means of a
fusion technique using a
secondary laser Well
when I tried it I
discovered Kent had
sabotaged it so it
collapsed on itself
Everyone looks at Kent in disgust
CHRIS (CONTD)
And I want to thank him
for the thought
KENT
What
CHRIS
The Deuterium and
Fluorine take up enough
space by themselves
right Well the mistake
weve been making up to
now is in trying to kick
up the power by means of
yet another outside
source Big and bulky
right Well the elegance
of this is that by
reflecting part of the
lasing light back in the
gas jets we supercharge
the whole deal
increasing the power
tenfold with no increase
in size

KENT
This is a complete waste

of time
Mitch has been preparing the laser for
demonstration He is struggling to lift
several thick metal plates

CHRIS

Kent make yourself

useful for once and help

put those plates against

the wall
Kent does and everyone stands back

CHRIS (CONTD)

Okay Mitch do it This

should work
Mitch switches on the main laser It comes
to life Gases flow and a beam appears
hitting the plate without effect

MITCH
Now we open the vacuum
chamber
He turns a valve and the beam begins to
heat up the plate
CHRIS

So far so good And now
cross your fingers
He throws a switch Theres a beat And
then suddenly the beam glows intensely
brighter cuts through the plate the
cabinets behind it and through the wall
out into the night Chris and Mitch jump
shut the whole thing off

CHRIS
Sorry about the wall
sir
KENT
(looking through
the hole)
And the tree across the
quad
ATHERTON
(in awe)

Screw the wall you did
it You really did it

KENT
(petulant)
Ive done my part too
ATHERTON

(ignoring Kent)
Okay Kinsley You did
it You pass
CHRIS
Thank you sir
ATHERTON
And I think we can get
that job back for you at
PEL

KENT

(apoplectic)

What You cant Thats
my job Ive done
everything youve ever
asked I get your
laundry and I finished
the mirror Look

Kent runs out of the room as Mitch and
Chris exchange a look and Atherton shakes

his head

Kent returns rolling a circular

precision mirror one meter in diameter

He exits

EXT CAM

KENT
See Do you have any idea
how hard it is to make a
film virtually 100 per
cent reflective one
micron thick and apply it
to a mirror this shape

ATHERTON
Good Kent
(to Chris ina
hurry)
I have to go have a
pressing
MITCH
(very happy for
Chris)
Lets celebrate

(totally
frustrated)

k at where the beam has cut a hole

through the head of the statue of Dr

Bradford

EXT STREET-NIGHT

They loo

k high up at a hole where the beam

went through a telephone pole and then

burned through a billboard on top of

INT BAR-LATER
Our group is celebrating The jukebox
blares Chris and Ick are drinking beers
Mitch and Jordan are holding hands
sharing a milkshake and feeding each other
French fries
MITCH
I dont think Im ready
for that yet Maybe we
should wait a year at
least until I get my
license
JORDAN
I understand There are a
lot of things to be
considered here For
example I could drive
Hopsfield enters and sits down at the
table Everyone stares for a beat
HOPSFIELD
(to Chris)
Ive been thinking about
your laser solution
(a beat)
I figure youve increased
the output to six

megawatts

CHRIS
Yeah

HOPSFIELD
What would you use that
for

MITCH

The applications are
unlimited Industrial for
one

HOPSFIELD
With the gas tanks youve
designed the beam would
only last for forty
seconds What good is

that

CHRIS
I dont care Laslo I
graduated

MITCH

Let the engineers figure

out a use for it Thats

not our concern
HOPSFIELD
Maybe somebody already
has a use for it one for
which its perfectly
designed
JORDAN
You mean Atherton had
something in mind all
along
HOPSFIELD
Looks at the facts very
high power portable
limited firing time
unlimited range All
youd need is a big
spinning mirror and you
could vaporize a human
target from space
Hopsfield gets up and walks outside
Silence for a beat

CHRIS
This is not good
ICK
You want another beer
MITCH

How big a mirror

The room is dark lit only by morning

in aluminum foil Kent is amazed

EXT ATHERTONS HOUSE
Chris and Mitch who are running toward
the house are stopped in their tracks by
the incredible sight of the red laser beam
shooting down out of the heavens striking
the grass tracking across the lawn then
up the wall of Athertons house
NT ATHERTONS HOUSE
The beam strikes the window and for one

tiny moment causes the most incredible
light show anyone has ever seen
KENT
(in awe)
On

he window is obliterated by the laser
light which crashes down directly onto
the aluminum foil-covered pool

KENT (CONTD)

-

Oh my

he foil is heated instantly in the laser
light and there is the SOUND of tiny
explosions building to a roar Ina
second the foil rises violently and tears
open Kent picks up a piece of debris and
examines it

-

KENT
Popcorn
In the next instant he is engulfed in
popcorn
EXT ATHERTONS HOUSE
The beam disappears as suddenly as it
came Everyone stands in awe A few
kernels fly out of the broken window then
a storm
INT ATHERTONS HOUSE
Kent and furniture are being forced up the
stairs by a rising tide of popping
popcorn He struggles against it loses
and sinks into the mound like a dinosaur
in quicksand
EXT ATHERTONS HOUSE
The windows are filling up with popcorn
Finally they crack and break as popcorn
forces its way out of the house wherever
it can
MITCH
Kent
Chris and Mitch head for the front door
Suddenly it bursts open and Kent is
carried out by a moving wall of popcorn
INT COMMAND CENTER
People furiously check systems

self destruct on the monitor
DECKER

ATHERTON

Unlock the birds eye
He takes over the command module sighting
system
ATHERTON
Im tracing where the
shot went
We watch as the monitors view swings away
and across a residential neighborhood
coming to rest on a birds eye view of his
own house
ATHERTON (CONTD)
Oh no
The monitor view moves in to reveal what
looks like a growing mushroom
DECKER
What have you done
ATHERTON
Retired
EXT ATHERTONS HOUSE
The group looks on as the mountain of
popcorn continues to engulf the house
Meredith goes to see if Kent is all right

CHRIS
(to Mitch)
Do you think we used too
much
MITCH
Maybe a little
CHRIS

Well I guess we all
learned something here
today
JORDAN

CHRIS
I dont know but it
seemed like the right
thing to say didnt it

As they continue to watch the destruction
of the house and various neighbors come
out to see whats what a Winnebago pulls
up and stops Hopsfield gets out

HOPSFIELD

away The others watch it go

ICK

too weird around here

CHRIS

JORDAN

MITCH

In the background the popcorn has split
the walls of the house and finally lifts
the roof off like the top of a pot The
whole house tilts to its side and the
popping stops

As we PULL BACK Athertons car pulls up
and he gets out dumbstruck Dr Meredith
walks over to him and confronts him Kent
joins Chris and the others who watch

THE END
