The book miraculously opens by itself and as a nostalgic

version of SCHOOL DAYS PLAYS OVER the pages quickly

where the story begins This page is labeled DICK at
the bottom and the picture on the page is of a young boy
of about ten sitting under a tree reading IVANHOE I

the pictures in the book are in that romanticized and naive
style unique to the Dick and Jane Series But we shall
use the real childhood photos of our stars Jane Fonda and
George Segal)

Another page turns and we SEE a picture of Dicks father
a rugged but gentle distinguished but earthy fun but
serious neat but casual guy standing on the front porch

mirror trying for greater clarity of speech
