THE FILM OPENS IN A BLACK AND WHITE DREAMSCAPE Except
for che sound of wind the images are drained of strength
Theyre harsh and reedy -

There are manifold images of a uterine passage but the
hard contrast makes it seem like were watching enormous
paramecium mating under a microscope Were moving upe-
wards along the walls of the tunnel with bizarre SOUND
FX towards a light which shines and then

A huge BABYS HEAD squeezes out the passage -- and theres
a squawk of pain and the lights in the vague room switch
to an intenser tone

The BABY OBJECT is pulled from the blurry passage and
swung in the air by its heels dangling but soundless
Only one cry and then nothing again but the wind --

ang the FACES of the hURSES « ard the MOTHER lying there
all this from the babys POV - leading to an upside ©
down short of the umbilical cord being severed Another
sharp sereech of pain - and then the silence again and
the wind and the DOCTOR is seen upsice down doing
something snd the view of the world chenges and the
DOCTOR is seen upright pessing the child to a NURSE who
cradles it all this continuing from the babys POV as
the NURSE looks up and says ssnething (soundless) to
somebody unseen - end then tilts the CHILD around so
that it can see --

A MAN in an elegant dark cape with suit and walking stick
elutched in his hand Hes reaching forward to touch
the baby The man has no face The breariing of the

‘ehild which has grown more and more iadored now violently

climaxes to A SCREAM -

Mr Brule would you mind petting to -

BRULE
The point Miss Prynn is that once
this company realizes that Extra-
Sensory Perception is not a miracle
but a skill subject to wage-hour
limitations the quicker were going
to turn our profit picture around
Therere 100000 3rd Class Espers in
the Esper Guild We employ 200 of

15 People like me and Harrington and

SCREEN » Effect to be worked out so that the figure of
CORNELIUS REICH om the screen is as multidimensional as
possible The patriarch of the family is in his sixties
and is blind im one milky eye He has a malevolent facial
character and sits somewhat stiffly in a pastoral GARDEN
setting on the family estate talking to camera from a
bench The SOUND for some reason is atrocious but its
scratchiness lends another bizarre bent to the cenrent of
his speech Ke is wearing a double-breasted suit and
watch chain suggesting the late 140s The FILM 18 IN
BLACK AND WHITE

CORNELIUS REICH
For you Reiches who will some after me
the test of intellect you will find
is the refusal to belabor the obvious
If youve opened the envelope and
are now looking at this piece of film
we understand each other

The first traces of humor appear now on the old mans face
CORNELIUS REICH
Confronted as I have been all my life

by the jealousy and hatred of my -

enemies and the hatred of my friends
I have hypostulated four abstract mutder
plans which 1 now bequeath to you as
part of your inheritance as a Reich

BEN REICH sits there absorbed his face lit by the screen

CORNELIUS REICH
The important thing to remember is ghat
the essence of murder never changes
In every era it remains the conflict
eof the killer against society with
‘the victin as prize Therefore its
imperative the killer anter into the
contract of surder with clear intention
and sharp mind This requires an
amoral sind free of doubt conscience
or the trappings of guilt Any one
of these will inevitably cause the
subconscious of the killer to give
himself away Society functions bese
off the collective guile of its - o
masses The rebal therefore must
mot cotpromise with that society or
he will relinguish his greatness
and become ong of many

NOTE ESPER EFFECT 2 These “thoughts” have been transferred

fom Reich to the Young Msn in shore bursts of sound over
and under the track The effect should aspire to more
subtlety than the ordinary dub The imagery should be
varied and sudden on the sound tracks -- donization of
voice modulations whispers rock mix effects approxima-
ting levels of consciousness semi-consciousness -- and
the lower ranges incorporating animal sounds growling
sighing wailing sounds of grief femininemasculine

So you thought Prefect Powell a

for this

POWELL
Your Honor ic was a remarkably complex
case When we ran our evidence through
the computer we were told the
financial motive was insufficient
We were lost Even Reich told hinself
he was killing DCourtney for
financial reasons When DCourtney
accepted Reichs merger offer Reich
was subconsciously compelled to
misunderstand the message He had te
He had to go on believing he murdered
for money because he couldns face
the real motive

What is the proof Powell

POWELL

Well once we peeped this your honors
we backtracked We codified the
genes of DCourtney and Reich and
ound the exact duplications in their
DNA codes -- whereas Reichs step-
fathers chromosomes never matched
those of Ben Reich in any single
component

Watching are TRACY DCOURTNEY and BECK Tracy appears
to be in her twenties again her concentration focused
on the proceedings

POWELL
There were so many other signposts
DCourtney was driving himself to
suicide with feelings of guile abour
abandoning his son who he now knew
across the economic battleground as
Ben Reich He wanted forgiveness
He wanted merger But Reich coulda’e

unconscious He wanted to destroy
the father whod rejected him but

he couldnt possibly hurt his own
sisterUltimately there were tha
bombs he planted against himself

JUDGE 7
Without self-knowledge

POWELL
Totally unconsciously
Ked murdered his father and
discharged his hatred bue when we
couldn’t stop him it was his own
conscience that punished him at
the deepest levels of his psyche

JUDGE 6
This Man With No Face

POWELL
Yes The figure had no face because
Reich couldnt accept the truth e
that hed recognized DCourtney as
his father So we confronted Reich
with the Mam With No Face By mass
carhexis we built a pool of latene
energy from every esper in the city
We construsted a common neurotic
impulse for Reith «-- the illusion that
he alone in the world was veal The
terror of that solitude is what drove
him finally to confront himself and
confess the crime
