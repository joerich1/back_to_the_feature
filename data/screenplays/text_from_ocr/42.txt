RICKEY
He may stay there or he may be
brought to Brooklyn But if Jackie
does come up to the Dodgers the
biggest threat to his success the
one enemy most likely to ruin that
success is the Negro people
themselves
There is shocked silence in the room Rickey notices a group
of KIDS watching from a raised running track soldiers on

RICKEY
I say it as cruelly as I can to
make you all realize the weight of
responsibility that is not only on
myself and the Dodgers but on
Negroes everywhere For on the day
Jackie enters the National League
if he does I have no doubt every
one of you will form parades and
welcoming committees Youll
strut Youll wear badges Youll
hold Jackie Robinson days and
Jackie Robinson nights Youll get
drunk fight and be arrested
This is too much People are slackjawed Rickey powers on

RICKEY
Youll wine and dine him until he
is fat and futile Youll
symbolize his importance into a
national comedy and yes a tragedy
So let me tell you this
(pounds his fist)
If any group or segment of Negro
society uses the advancement of
Jackie Robinson in baseball as a
triumph of race over race I will
regret the day I ever signed him to
a contract and I will personally
see that baseball is never so
abused and misrepresented again

white shirts and Id think his skin
is so dark why would he do that

was showing off his color I was
wrong He wasnt conceited he was
proud Always of who and what he
is Id never met another man like
that What about you How did you
meet your wife

and a little white boy was up to
bat You know what he was doing

Wiping his hands on his pants
swinging with his arms outstretched

Ive given my life to it Forty
odd years ago I was a player coach
at Ohio Wesleyan University We
had a Negro catcher best hitter on
the team Charley Thomas
Rickey starts slowly rubbing the baseball in his hands

RICKEY

A fine young man I saw him laid
low Broken because of the color
of his skin and I didnt do enough
to help I told myself I did but
I didnt The game I loved had
something unfair at the heart of
it I ignored it But a time came
when I could no longer do that

(LOOKS UP)
You let me love baseball again
Thank you
