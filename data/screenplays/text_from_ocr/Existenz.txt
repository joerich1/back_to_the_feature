INT COUNTRY CHURCH - NIGHT

The man facing us is bearded sweating intense joyous
Jacket and tie jeans fortyish His name is Wittold Levi
eXistenzZ

Levi turns to a chalkboard on a tripod and writes the word

LEVI
Written like this One word
Small e Capital X capital Z
He turns back to face an as-yet-unseen audience

LEVI
eXistenZ Its new its from
Antenna Research and its here
right now
We now see Levis audience about seventy-five people some
standing some sitting on plastic folding chairs They are
of very mixed age and type but they all cheer and applaud
enthusiastically
We are in the central playing area of a small deconsecrated
country church and Levi performs on a broad low carpeted
plywood dais At the far end of the dais a man and a woman
- assistants to Levi - are carefully laying out about two
dozen plastic modules that look somewhat like high-tech ski
boots

LEVI

My name is Wittold Levi my
friends call me Witt - and Im
the project manager for eXistenZ
I recognize some familiar faces -
thats all right thats all
right We wont throw you out We
encourage consumer loyalty and
we want you to help us with our
product testing Were a team
Antenna and you
A delighted stir from the crowd

LEVI
Those of you who have come to our
invited seminars before will know
that I normally lead the group
through our new games but

(MORE )

LEVI (CONTD)
tonight it wont be me No for
the test launch of eXistenZ by
Antenna we have brought you a
seminar leader who is rather
special
An unbelieving excited stir Could it really be

LEVI
Yes it is The worlds greatest
game designer is here in person
to lead you the first test
enclave through her newest
creation eXistenZ by Antenna
The small crowd is now tremendously excited wide-eyed
murmuring one or two have actually gotten on their knees

LEVI
I give you the Game-Pod Goddess
herself - Allegra Geller
Levi moves to the edge of the crowd works his way into it
until he has reached a small unobtrusive figure who up to
now has hardly been noticed She stands next to a security
guard who is dressed in a suit and tie but carries an
electronic wand of some sort His name-tag identifies him as
Ted Pikul (rhymes with Michael not with pickle) and we
will see more of him later
As Levi takes her hand and gently leads her out of the
crowd her fans applaud softly touch her hem They part
like water as she passes amongst them clutching her own
personal game-pod case with both hands She mounts the dais
like a blind person led by her seeing-eye dog
Allegra Geller early thirties conservatively dressed is
bright acutely aware but wary and controlled When she
speaks she is deliciously sexily shy serious melodic

GELLER
The world of games is in a kind
of a trance People are
programmed to accept so little
but the possibilities are so
great

(PAUSE)
You probably thought that
tonight we were going to test a
new game that I designed
Excited murmurings from the crowd

GELLER
But there is no new game to test
at least not in the usual sense
Confused slightly disappointed mutterings

GELLER
No no its going to be much
better than you expected because
eXistenZ is not just a game Its
an entirely new game system
Antenna Research and I developed
it together - the eXistenZ System
by Antenna - and it involves a
whole lot of new toys which you
are going to be the first to try
out
The crowds spirit rises again Levi steps forward
playing off the renewed energy

LEVI
MetaFlesh
Levi turns to the chalkboard and writes the word

LEVI
Written like this One word
Capital M capital F MetaFlesh
is what our new toys are made of

smiling
- the MetaFlesh Game-Pod only
from Antenna Research It
connects with any industry
standard bioport which I know
you all have or you wouldnt be
here
(chuckles from the crowd)

-using however a very non-
standard connecting device which
we call

Levi turns again to the chalkboard

LEVI

-we call an UmbyCord Spelled

like this

Levi writes the word out and then turns back to his by-now-
salivating audience

LEVI
I guess you can tell I started
off as a schoolteacher

4 (APPRECIATIVE CHUCKLES)
But I never had anything quite so
fun or so revolutionary to teach
as what Allegra and I are going
to teach you all tonight
With a theatrical flourish Levi whirls around to face his
two assistants who have finished laying out their devices
on the back table and are now standing crisply at attention
at either end of it

LEVI
Are the MetaFlesh Game-Pods by
Antenna Research ready

ASSISTANTS

(TOGETHER)
Yes Mr Levi

LEVI
And how many of these precious
prototypes did we manage to bring
with us

FEMALE ASSISTANT
Twenty-one Mr Levi
Levis face clouds slightly The audience does not hear the
following exchange

LEVI

(SOTTO VOCE)
Twenty-one I thought we had an
even two dozen

MALE ASSISTANT
The first three we opened were
unhealthy

LEVI
Really Any chance that some of
the others

FEMALE ASSISTANT
We think were clean

LEVI
J

(RESTRAINED FURY)
God-damn better be
Levi turns back to his audience radiant once more

LEVI
We have twenty-one prototype
MetaFlesh Game-Pods and that
means that for our first wave
test enclave we need twenty-one
volunteers who will port in these
slave units with the Game-Pod
Goddess herself
Levi doesnt need to finish his pitch Every hand is waving
in the air and every pair of lips is saying Me me oh
God please let it be me
Geller can only stand by modestly and beam at the intensity
game-

of the small crowds enthusiasm
INT COUNTRY CHURCH MINUTES LATER - NIGHT

A SHORT MONTAGE as the twenty-one volunteers mount the dais
and are fitted with their game gear

The assistants undo the heavy-duty snap locks and split open
the ski-boot-like plastic modules on the back table Inside
resting in a lining of dense foam are what look almost like
living kidneys the MetaFlesh Game-Pods

Coiled in each boot toe is the Y-shaped multi-player
UmbyCord that comes with each pod a split twelve-foot
connector cord that resembles an umbilical cord twisted
translucent blue and red veiny vessels running just below
the surface

The volunteers watch in hushed reverence as though about to
receive communion

The game-pods are gingerly lifted out of their cases

The UmbyCords are uncoiled and plugged into ports in the

back of the game-pods

The shirts blouses and jackets of the volunteers are
lifted at the back to reveal their owners bioports which
are small soft-plastic flesh-coloured permanent spinal
jacks positioned just above the belt line

Twenty-two folding chairs are placed in a circle on the
dais As each volunteer has his UmbyCord plugged into his
bioport he takes one of the seats and places his quivering
rippling game-pod now connected directly to his nervous
system on his lap

fq

The last chair is taken by Allegra Geller who is fussed
i over and settled by Levi as she unpacks her own master

pod with exaggerated delicacy and is then ported in to the
players on either side of her

We END the short MONTAGE with the security guard Pikul
standing with arms folded near the churchs side door
watching the proceedings with fascination

A loud knocking at the door forces Pikul to turn away from
the action on the dais He walks over to the door and opens
it A hyper exasperated fan almost tumbles into the church
Pikul immediately raises his electronic wand and bars his
way

PIKUL
Hold it Not so fast

In response the fan thrusts a card at him

Pikul takes the card a complex invitation card which
includes a holographic photo of the fan under which floats
his name Joel Dichter Dichter anxiously looks past Pikul
into the depths of the church nervously adjusting the vinyl
case slung over his shoulder

DICHTER
Oh god I hope Im not too late
Did I miss the port-in

PIKUL

Its just the first wave You can
be part of the second wave
(rereads the invitation)

OK Joel Dichter Put your arms
up I have to scan you Metal and
heavy synthetics cant come in

DICHTER

(INCREDULOUS)
A weapons check

PIKUL
More for recording devices Lotta
money invested in these games
Industrial espionage happens
Whats in this case

DICHTER
I brought my game-pod Its got
original Marway tissue
architecture Its kind of
obsolete but I was hoping

(MORE )

DICHTER (CONTD)
even though I couldnt afford the
Antenna Fifteen upgrade I
figured out a method of virtual
porting that I thought might
Pikul uses his wand to scan the vinyl case then opens the
zipper and feels around In the case is a more solid
rubbery version of the new MetaFlesh pods

PIKUL
You wont need it tonight
Everythings provided for
Dichter suddenly spots Geller on the dais He almost faints

DICHTER
Migod Is that who I think it is

PIKUL

(with paternal pride)
Yeah thats her Shes
something isnt she

DICHTER
But why would a star like her
come to a product seminar in a
little one-horse town like this

PIKUL
This is where the real people
live Joel Her real fans like

you
DICHTER

Yeah well you said it Just

like me

Dichter has scanned OK Pikul waves him into the church to
join the spectators who will form the second wave and re-
locks the door

On the dais in the center of the circle of linked game
players Levi nods at Geller

LEVI
Everythings in order Are you
ready Allegra

T
GELLER

(PUMPED)
Sure This is my favourite part
There is giddy laughter in the room Geller looks at every
player-in the circle as Levi steps down off the platform and
retires to the far edge of the small watching throng

GELLER
Im ready to download eXistenZ by
Antenna Research into you all
now Im warning you its going
to be a wild ride but dont
panic no matter what happens
Ill see you all back here in no
time at all
Now the giddy laughter goes a touch nervous uncertain but
its too late Geller depresses a nipple-like protuberance
on the game-pod on her lap and all the players close their
eyes and go rigid like members of a seance who have
suddenly been contacted by the spirit world The pods in
their laps begin a rhythmic peristaltic rippling
At the edge of the crowd Pikul sidles up to Levi

PIKUL

(TO LEVI)
She seems to be very shy It
never occurred to me that a big
star would be shy

LEVI
She spends most of her time alone
in a room designing her games I
think shed like it best if she
never had to show them to

anybody

PIKUL
Really She doesnt enjoy all the
adulation

LEVI

She hates having to port in with
her fans Its too intimate

PIKUL
Then why does she do it

LEVI

(LAUGHS)
We make her do it
ID

PIKUL
By we you mean the game
company Antenna Research

A

LEVI
Thats what I mean

PIKUL
Why

I
LEVI

(SUDDENLY SUSPICIOUS)
Are you with us or did an
independent security company send
you

PIKUL
Me Oh Im with your own
management training program
(shows him a card)
I want to end up in marketing and
public relations
(holds up security wand)
The only thing I know about
security is how to switch this
thing on

LEVI

(SATISFIED)
Well for example weve spent a
fortune developing eXistenZ but
we all know its a risky project
She might have to make changes
Its the only way we can convince
her that there might be a
problem
PIKUL

(PUZZLED)
A problem with her new game

LEVI
eXistenZ is a lot more than a
game

PIKUL

Yeah right its a game system
I heard that

LEVI

And were worried that its too
intellectual too complex too
weird too artsy That argument
never bothers her until she faces
her fans She hates to be
rejected in the flesh so we make
her come out sometimes to take

the heat
PIKUL
(ADMIRINGLY )
4 Ive heard that shes very
sensitive

A strange choral humming begins to fill the church Pikul
and Levi turn their attention to the dais where the fans
rock and sway with the pulsing of the pods in their laps

PIKUL
What are they doing

LEVI

(LAUGHS)
Its the new Antenna Research
theme song We thought this would
be a good way to launch it
Everybody who plays eXistenZ is
going to be very familiar with
that tune
Haltingly but gamely Pikul tries to hum along

PIKUL

Catchy

Levi helps him out and soon the whole room is humming along
happily warmed by the Antenna Research corporate theme
song

The whole room that is except for Joel Dichter who at
the edge of the dais is more concerned with fumbling around
in the vinyl pod-case hanging from his shoulder

n the case we watch as Dichter tears open his obsolete
game-pod to reveal a bizarre weapon a pistol made of bone
and gristle almost like the half-decayed body of a small
mammal - whose snout is the barrel whose rigid hind leg is
the trigger

Dichter takes his weapon out of its case shakes off a few
gelatinous strips of game-pod flesh and steps up onto the
dais

Pikul is the first to notice this He glances at Levi whos
still blissed out and humming then launches himself
awkwardly through the crowd

Now in the middle of the circle Dichter makes his way
towards the blissfully unsuspecting Geller raising his
weapon as he goes

DICHTER
Death to eXistenZ Death to
Antenna Research Death to the
demoness Allegra Geller

P
PIKUL

(TO DICHTER)
No Dont do it
Dichter turns to see Pikul stumbling through the small
crowd scrambling onto the dais Distracted Dichter
hurriedly raises his weapon again and fires it at Geller
The first shot hits her in the shoulder and spins her off
her chair which collapses over her and takes the second
bullet on its seat rim
The circle of players on the dais moans as one swoons and
jostles they are all feeling the neural surge of Gellers
traumatized nervous system Peeking out from under her
folding chair Gellers eyes are wide with fear and
confusion She clutches her shoulder without being aware of
it Blood seeps in between her fingers

Now Levi and his two assistants scramble onto the platform
to get at Dichter who fires wildly hitting two of the
players nearest Geller The circle of players immediately
goes spastic screaming and twitching and dropping to the
ground and writhing Many of them are clutching their
shoulders in the same spot as Geller sympathy pain
transmitting through their UmbyCords

Pikul manages to tackle Dichter then starts whacking at him
with the security wand Dichter twists around and raises his
weapon at Pikul who immediately backs off in terror But
before Dichter can pull the trigger the two assistants
produce small normal pistols from hidden holsters and empty
their clips into the prostrate Dichter Dichter manages to
squeeze off one last shot at the approaching Jevi hitting
him squarely in the chest Levi goes down and is lost
amongst the jostling feet

The watching fans pile onto the dais and begin to help the
players unplug from the game-pods which are obviously
causing them distress Three of the players attack the dying
Dichter dragging their game-pods after them kicking at
whatever part of him they can find in the confused mass of
bodies
in the turmoil Pikul is knocked to the ground Amid the
stamping sliding feet he finds himself lying across the
stricken-Levi Levi clutches Pikul desperately

LEVI
Get her out of here Save her
There might be more of them Go
on

PIKUL
Me Me take her

LEVI
(urgent pleading)
We have enemies in our own house
Trust no one Trust no one
The wide-eyed Pikul scrambles to his feet and promptly trips
over the all-but-dead Dichter He falls painfully to his

knees struggles u
his hand
He turns back to

way towards them t
cocked faces set
into his suit poc
looking around for
She and her chair
few feet away and
unports her which
lot of clarity Pi
arm screams at t

Pikul stares at it
Levi
he loses consciousness

et and jumps off the platform

and finds the bizarre bone gun in

fascinated horrified

but Levis eyes are rolling back as
The two assistants are making their

hrough the shoving shuffling throng guns

hard Panicked Pikul jams the bone gun

wildly

p again

Geller

have slipped off the dais in a heap only a
she is in several kinds of agony Pikul
immediately brings her some relief and a

ul wards off a couple of fans with one

nem

PIKUL

(SCREAMS )

Shes coming with me
responsible for her

Im
Shes

supposed to come with me

To his surprise

Geller laughs a dazed

hearty laugh

GELLER

(LAUGHS)

Am I With you

PIKUL
(quietly firmly)
Yeah youre coming with me

Pikul pulls her to

her feet but she immediately dives back

to the floor to find her game-pod and UmbyCord

GELLER
(suddenly near hysteria)

I cant lose this
this

She finds the game
flattened on one s

I cant lose

-pod still under the folding chair a bit
ide but in one piece She grabs the game-

pod and its UmbyCord and stuffs them into her MetaFlesh pod
case which has been knocked to the edge of the dais As she
clutches it to her Pikul takes her hand and hauls her
through the crowd which is now spilling off the overcrowded
dais and clutching at Geller fitfully like Velcro They
head for the door fighting everybody off as though they
might be lethal

As they leave through the side door Pikul sees five or six
fans shrieking like monkeys still stomping and kicking the
body of Dichter viciously hysterically while Levis two
assistants carry him to the safety of the churchs apse

EXT COUNTRY CHURCH - NIGHT

Pikul and Geller spew out of the doorway and find themselves
standing alone in the weedy parking lot of the church The
church itself stands isolated on a country road just outside
a town which is not much more than two gas stations and a
crossroad

Pikul and Geller look around wildly The vehicles in the
parking lot are country pickup trucks rusted vans 4x4s
Across the road aloof maybe too high-class for the parking
lot sits a Land Rover Defender 110 the one with the roof
cage and the seven seats and the winch hanging off the
front Geller gestures towards the Defender

GELLER
Lets take my limo

PIKUL

(WILD)
No no

GELLER
Why no

PIKUL

I dont trust the driver

GELLER
You drive idiot

They cross the road and jump in the Defender Frances the
driver sixtyish a retired lady farmer who moonlights is
apprehensive

FRANCES
Whats the commotion Miss
Geller Say are you all right
Whats goin on in there

GELLER
We need this vehicle and we need
it without you But with the
keys

FRANCES
I cant do that I cant abandon
my vehicle
Geller pulls the weird gun out of an astonished Pikuls
pocket She points it at Frances

GELLER
Get out Frances You can say you
were hijacked

FRANCES

(CHUCKLES)
Itll take more than a dead
squirrel to get me out of this
seat
Geller fires two shots One rips a hole in Francess
headrest

FRANCES
(getting out of her seat)
You have to push the shift lever
down to get it into reverse

GELLER
Thanks Frances
They drive off down the country road leaving Frances in the
dust

INT DEFENDER LIMO - NIGHT
Pikul drives He can see why the limo is an off-road

vehicle the road is terrible dirt and gravel stutter
potholes and sharp ridges the occasional fallen tree

PIKUL
(manic scared)

I normally like the countryside
dont you Normally the country
is relaxing and calm

GELLER
Only if you dont really know
whats going on

PIKUL
What do you mean

GELLER
There is great stress and anger
and violence in the countryside
Thousands of life forms all
screaming ME ME ME and trying to
kill and dominate and devour the
other life forms Its terrifying
and exhausting

PIKUL

(LAMELY)
Well I like the countryside

GELLER
Thats good ‘cause you might end
up spending a lot of time here

PIKUL
I might

GELLER
Sure If you go back home to the
city theyll probably be waiting
for you

PIKUL
They

GELLER
Yeah My assassins Theyd want
to have a little talk with you
about where I am

PIKUL
I was hoping that was just one
crazy guy

GELLER
Did you hear the way he screamed
at me He wasnt alone

PIKUL
Everybody likes a conspiracy
Its more satisfying than just
one crazy guy doing one crazy
thing
Geller goes silent

PIKUL
Well what are we going to do out
here Do you know your way
around You know any country
people

GELLER
Not country people Games people
The countrysides full of games
development people project co-
ordinators little factories -
you name it

PIKUL
Thats weird I never knew that

GELLER
The citys full of bad
microwaves bad thermals bad
electro-optics You cant shield
from it anymore You cant get
true readings The whole industry
moved out of the city years ago

PIKUL
So you know your way around We
can hide out

GELLER
Maybe But it seems I have some
enemies I didnt know I had
Death to Allegra Geller Howd
you like to hear somebody with a
gun screaming Death to Ted
Pikul
PIKUL
Wow
(reflective pause then)
Hey howd you know my name

GELLER
(indicating his name tag)
Youre labelled

PIKUL
Oh Yeah

(PAUSE)
How did you know how to fire that
gun Ive never seen anything
like it

GELLER
It has a trigger I pulled it

PIKUL
Can I see it

GELLER
Later I think Im gonna use it
in my next game If there ever is
a next game
Pikul glances at her He hits a pothole and she bounces
around in her seat exposing her far shoulder to him Her
shirt is soaked with blood

PIKUL
Migod youre bleeding I forgot
you got hit
There is an urgent buzzing from somewhere in Pikuls breast
pocket

GELLER
Whats that

PIKUL
Its my pink-fone Im not sure I
should answer it
GELLER
Answer it
Pikul pulls the pink-fone - its soft surgical plastic
palm-sized - out of his pocket When he squeezes it open a
diffuse pink light swells up from deep inside it

PIKUL

(INTO PHONE)
Ted Pikul

(PAUSE)
What happened Some fan went
crazy and started shooting up the
place I dont know why He was
just nuts Allegra Geller Shes
with me Were OK Yeah Yeah

(MORE )

PIKUL (CONTD)

(PAUSE)
Youre kidding me Youre kidding
me God 1 cant believe it I
cant do that No how can I do
that Well Im not really sure
where we are because
Geller grabs the pink-tone from him She fumbles around with
it trying to find the power button She accidentally
summons up a read-out which she pauses to look at What she
sees makes her glance up at Pikul

PIKUL
What Can I have my pink-tone
back
Geller finds the power button and pushes it The pink inner
light flutters out She unceremoniously throws the pink-tone
out the window It lands in a rain ditch full of frogs

PIKUL

(IN SHOCK)
What did you do that for That
was our lifeline to civilization

GELLER
That was a rangefinder As long
as you have that they know where
you are

PIKUL
They You mean head office

GELLER
I mean anybody

(PAUSE)
I heard what Levi said to you He
said We have enemies in our own

house He said it as he was
dying
PIKUL
(FLUSTERED)

I dont think he died I mean do
you I think he maybe fainted
Maybe he went unconscious

PIKUL
That was Alex Kindred head of
publicity and marketing at
Antenna HQ

(WISTFUL)
on that very expensive pink-
fone you threw away

(DEEP SIGH)
He said that some bizarre
fanatical group called the Anti-
eXistenZialists has put a price
of 5 million dollars on your
head payable to anybody who
kills you Its been released to
all the media now Everybody
knows about it
GELLER

(IN DISBELIEF)
Anti-existentialists

PIKUL
No Anti-eXistenZialists Capital
X capital Z They somehow found
out about eXistenZ and they want
to kill you for creating it They
say that the eXistenZ game system
will finally destroy reality
or something totally nuts like
that

GELLER

(STRANGELY SATISFIED)
Yeah

PIKUL
It makes sense to you Youre not
suprised

GELLER
I hear things Its hard to
surprise me

(PAUSE)
And what else

PIKUL
Kindred said that Im your
bodyguard and the company is
holding me totally responsible
for your safety

GELLER

(PAUSE)
Pikul why dont you have a gun
with you
PIKUL
What

GELLER
Youre not armed They told me
you were my security but you have
no weaponry

PIKUL
Who told you that Im just a
marketing trainee My clinic
master thought Id learn
something about marketing if I
moonlighted as a security guard
on one of your test previews

GELLER
Fuck Im marked for death and
they send me on the road with a
PR nerd

PIKUL
(realization setting in)
Jesus Marked for death

GELLER
Dont sweat it Pikul Ill
handle it We just have to
disappear for a while And right
now we have to stop

PIKUL
We do Why
GELLER
(DEADPAN)
So we can have an intimate moment

together
EXT COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

The intimate moment involves Pikul digging the bullet out of
I Gellers shoulder with a Swiss Army knife while kneeling

front of the idling Defenders headlights Pikulis being
squeamish and not getting the job done
GELLER

(IRRITATED)
Cmon If youre gonna do it do
it

PIKUL
OK OK

He grits his teeth and digs in with a bit more gusto
Something yellow and white like a kernel of corn flips out
of her wound and onto the roads shredding asphalt Pikul
feels around for it finds it holds it up to the light

PIKUL
I got it Wow Did somebody bite
you

GELLER

What do you mean

PIKUL
What I just dug out of you Its
a tooth A human tooth
Pikul holds the tooth out to her but she just glances at
it then rummages around in her MetaFlesh game-pod bag

GELLER
Lemme see that weirdo pistol
Geller pulls the strange weapon out of the bag After a
moment of study she expertly pops the magazine out of the
grip The gristly magazine is packed with teeth

GELLER
Yep The bullets are human teeth
Look - this ones got a cavity

PIKUL
That thing was designed to get
past any kind of metal or
synthetics detector Its all
flesh and bone

GELLER
I suppose the smaller caliber
pistols would have to fire baby
teeth The tooth fairy could go
I into the arms business

PIKUL

(INCREDULOUS)
That guy really came there
tonight just to kill you

GELLER 4

(WITH IRONY)
Amazing isnt it

EXT MOTEL - NIGHT

We follow the Defender as it parks outside the Salmon Falls
Motel Pikul jumps out carrying two paper bags of Perky

Pats takeout He knees the truck door shut and walks over
to motel door 5

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Inside the very basic motel room Pikul sits hypnotized
reverentially watching Geller as he obsessively packs the
greasy remains of their Perky Pat burgers into the smallest
possible paper bundle

Geller is sitting in the middle of her twin bed her pod
before her on a hotel towel which is draped over her lap
UmbyCord jacked into her bioport a second towel slipping
off her shoulders leaving her almost naked her shoulder
wound livid in the 25-watt light of the night table lamp
Her hands twitch delicately over the surface of the pod like
insect antennae so delicately that we are not sure that she
is actually touching the pod Her eyes are half-closed and
she is obviously in some kind of trance-like ecstatic
state

Finally she comes out of it and unplugs her UmbyCord
discretely rearranging her towels in the process She sighs
and speaks not exactly to Pikul

GELLER
The whole gamesworld is in a kind
of trance
PIKUL
Yes I remember you said that at
the church

J

GELLER
People are prepared to accept so
little Theyre in acage formed
out of their own limited

(MORE )

GELLER (CONTD)
expectations They have no idea
what amazing things could be
theirs

PIKUL
Where were you just now What
were you doing

GELLER
(a worried frown)
I was wandering through eXistenZ
- the new system I mean
(a shy sexy smile)
I like it in there Of course
without another player youre
only a tourist Its frustrating

PIKUL
Why wont you let me contact
Antenna Theyve got to be going
crazy wondering whats happened
to you I mean its not like
weve done something wrong We
just ran because we didnt know
how many of them there were
right I think we owe it to
Antenna to let them know youre
all right to get them to send
somebody to help you who knows
what hes doing And besides I
cant I cant just keep doing

this whatever it is you know

forever not having any idea when

its going to be

Geller gets up and goes over to Pikul She pulls up his
shirt

PIKUL
Hey what are you doing

GELLER
Wheres your bioport Dont tell
me you were never fitted I cant
believe it
Pikul shrugs his shirt back down starts tucking it in

PIKUL
No I was never fitted with a
bioport What do you care

GELLER
Youre hoping to get into the biz
and youve never played one of my
games Youve never played any
game That means you have no idea

what a genius I am

PIKUL

(LAMELY)
My clinic master told me I dont
need to play a game to know how
to sell it

GELLER
Bullshit Posturing You dont
play my games you dont work for
Antenna Research Ill make sure
of that

PIKUL
Look Ive been dying to play
your games But I have this -
phobia about having my body
penetrated - surgically You know
what I mean

GELLER
Im not so sure I do

PIKUL
Getting a bioport fitted I
dunno I cant do it Its too
freaky Makes my skin crawl

GELLER
God cmon They just pop your
spine with a little hydro-gun
Shoot the port-plug into it They
do it at malls like getting your
ears pierced

PIKUL
Yeah sure With only an
infinitesimal chance of permanent
spinal paralysis Ive read all

about it

GELLER
Its your chosen profession
geek

She pauses then moves very close to him She breathes her
words slowly intimately into his ear

GELLER

(HOTLY)
Theres an intimacy involved in
playing eXistenZ that is beyond
description It has to be
experienced And frankly the
two-player version is the most
exquisitely intense Wouldnt you
like to play with me

PIKUL
(his resolve is crumbling)
Well yeah of course but Let
me uh let me call Antenna

GELLER
(a gentle threat)
They wouldnt want to talk to you
if they knew you had never had a
bioport installed Its company
policy you know They want you
to be passionate about your work

(VERY SEDUCTIVE)
Besides once youre ported
theres no end to the games you
can play

PIKUL

(HES SWEATING)
You cant seriously want to play
games now Not here Not while
were being hunted down by crazy
people
Geller sighs then switches into her explaining-the-facts-
of-life-to-a-child mode

GELLER
(cradling her pod)
My baby here took a huge hit in
the church Pikul You see how
shes quivering
Pikul takes a look The pod is in fact quivering like a
terrified hamster

PIKUL
It she yes shes quivering

R
GELLER
(EMOTIONAL)

When those UmbyCords got ripped

out of her in the church ripped

(MORE )
GELLER (CONT D)

out just as the game architecture
was being downloaded from her to
all those slave pods thats a
very vulnerable time for her She
could be crying out for help
right here right now

(CHOKING UP)
The only way I can tell if
everythings OK - the games not
been contaminated the pod my
baby is not about to be crippled
for life because of my negligence
- the only way is to play
eXistenZ with somebody friendly
Are you friendly or are you not

PIKUL

(PAUSE)
Sure all right
(he might have found a way

OUT)
Lets do it lets do it now
Let me see
(checks his watch)
To get an illegal unregistered
bioport installed at about
midnight - we just drive up to
your local country gas station
right

EXT COUNTRY GAS STATION - NIGHT

The Defender is parked by the pumps A gangly pump attendant
- his name embroidered on his overalls seems to be Gas -
fills the truck as Pikul and Geller hover nervously

GAS
Anything else I can do for you

GELLER
Well Gas you could check your
bioport-plugs

GAS
The what The sparkplugs

GELLER
You heard me My friend here has
a bioport problem

GAS

(COOL)
A bioport now thats a sort of
a hole in your spine isnt it
Lotta assholes ‘round here but
thats generally it I dont know
why youd be talking to me about
that lady
Geller smiles a knowing smile

GELLER
Sure you do
Gas looks at her closely for the first time His eyes widen
in disbelief He pulls a greasy wallet out of his overalls
and flips out the card holders Amongst various family
photos hot rod photos fishing photos is a photo of
Allegra Geller clipped from a glossy magazine Under the
photo is the legend Genius In A Game-Pod
Gas takes her hand in his and kisses it

GAS
Allegra Geller You changed my
life

INT GAS-STATION GARAGE - NIGHT

Pikul sits on a mouldy greasy plump wingback chair in the
corner of the gas-station garage watching Gas balance
shakily on one leg as he puts on a fresh set of overalls

PIKUL
What was your life like before

GAS
Before

PIKUL
Before it was changed by Allegra
Geller

GAS
I operated a gas station

PIKUL
But you still operate a gas
station dont you

GAS
Only on the most pathetic level
of reality Gellers work
liberated me

PIKUL
Liberated

GAS
Did you ever play her game
ArtGod One word capital A
capital G

PIKUL
I dont have a bioport remember

GAS
Thou the player of the game
art God Very spiritual Funny
too God the artist The
mechanic
(chuckles to himself)
Funny
Gas zips up his fresh overalls

PIKUL

(UNEASY)
Those are sterile are they

GAS
Not to worry They way they set
things up you could fire ina
bioport in a slaughterhouse and
not generate an infection

PIKUL
Then why the clean overalls

GAS
Its a mental thing Helps me
focus The one thing you dont
want to do is miss with the stud-

finder
PIKUL
Oh God
GAS
(BIG SMILE)

God the mechanic

ZR
Gas slides open a drawer of his red metal mechanics rolling
toolbox and pulls out a greasy device that looks like a
carbon-fibre voltage meter

GAS
We call this thing a stud-finder
It locates the spot on your spine
where the x intersects with the
y We dont want to be even a
micron out of whack Thats when
you get troubles Its a little
vadarsonarlaser thingee Marks
you with a special range-finding

dye
PIKUL
Never say dye
GAS
Lift up your shirt and turn

around

EXT GAS STATION - NIGHT
In the heat of the summer night game-pod case still slung
over her shoulder Geller wanders around the periphery of
the gas station touching things - trees the ground grass
- at random her expression suggesting that everything she
sees is amazing and delightful and slightly disturbing like
someone who has wandered into a sculpture garden where
everything is perfect in every detail except that everything
is made out of bronze

INT GAS-STATION GARAGE - NIGHT

Gas pulls the trigger on the stud-finder then removes it
from Pikuls back We see a small purple flower-mark like
the kind that marks sides of beef on the skin over Pikuls
spine just above the belt line Pikul stands up from his
kneeling position on the wingback chair He stretches
twists Everything seems to be all right

GAS
See that didnt hurt did it

PIKUL
I didnt expect that to hurt I
expect the next part to hurt
Gas pulls the bioport insertion gun out of another drawer
this time a locked wooden one bolted under his metal-topped
work bench It is a scary thing like a hydraulic jack
designed by Giger only smaller

PIKUL
Yeah thats what I expect will
hurt

GAS

Ive never crippled anyone yet

PIKUL
How many have you done

GAS
Three Well youll be the third

EXT GAS STATION - NIGHT
We are close on a bizarre insect which sits unsteadily on
the chrome of a gas pump handle Gellers hand comes into
frame and gently eases the creature into its palm Geller
floats her hand closer to her face and studies the creature
with an expression of rapture on her face

The insect is large praying mantis-sized and it has two
heads neither of which seems to know how to deal with the
other one Each time it attempts to move it falls over in
an awkward heap because its legs are all different sizes and
shapes It beats its large papery wings wildly in order to
pull itself upright and then begins the whole clumsy process
all over again Eventually its wing action lifts it off
Gellers hand - more by accident than will it seems - and
the creature disappears in the darkness surrounding the gas
pumps

INT GAS-STATION GARAGE - NIGHT

Geller enters the garage and sees Pikul with his back to the
wall of the service bay and a large wrench in his hand
poised and threatening Gas stands twenty feet away his
insertion gun at the ready A Mexican standoff

GELLER
Whats going on Gas

GAS
Hell hes acting like Im
attackin him People usually pay
meto do this you know

PIKUL
Yeah All two of them
As you can see Ive decided not
to have a bioport installed

Geller walks over to Pikul and puts her face quite close to
his He watches her lips move from the corner of his eye
They are full and moist and convincing

GELLER
This is it you see This is the
cage I was talking about the
cage of your own making which
keeps you trapped and pacing
about in the smallest possible
space forever Break out of your
cage Pikul Break out now

INT GAS-STATION GARAGE MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

Wearing mechanics work gloves Gas fires in the bioport
plug Its impact knocks the breath out of Pikul like being
kicked in the spine he cant even scream When Gas pulls
the insertion device away from Pikuls back we see the
glossy plastic head of the bioport plug Its surrounded by
a small angry-looking volcano of rashy irritated flesh

GELLER
That swelling doesnt last for
long Tomorrow you wont even
notice it

PIKUL
I love it Great
Pikul tries to get up from the wingback chair and promptly
collapses into the arms of Geller and Gas

PIKUL

(PANIC-STRICKEN)
Whats going on I cant walk

GAS
The procedure comes with its own
epidural just like when you have
a baby Kinda like instant
paralysis from the waist down
Thats why it didnt hurt you
Itll wear off in about twenty
minutes
As they ease Pikul into a sitting position in the chair Gas
almost drops the insertion gun which he has been holding in
one hand He leans it against the wingback chair and Pikul
notices blood and flecks of skin on Gass work gloves
PIKUL
Youre looking more like a
butcher than a mechanic

GAS
Things do get kinda confused
these days dont they Im gonna
go wash up You two make
yourselves at home
Gas strides off towards the washroom with an air of great
satisfaction Geller eases her game-pod out of its case and
starts to attach its two-player Y-shaped UmbyCord to it

PIKUL
What are you doing

GELLER
We dont have to wait for the
swelling to go down

PIKUL
Youre going to port into me
While Im paralysed

GELLER
You wanted to play my game
didnt you

PIKUL
Yeah I did and I do but
Here Now

GELLER
Its an instant-on world isnt
it
She lifts up his shirt to reveal the new bioport It already
looks a bit less angry than it did before Geller caresses
it prods it plays with it Then she takes out a little
bottle of WD-40 and sprays it around and into the port

PIKUL
Whats that for It feels cold

GELLER
New ports are sometimes a bit
tight Wouldnt want to hurt you

PIKUL
How come bioports dont get
infected I mean they open right
into your body
GELLER
Listen to what youre saying
Pikul Dont be ludicrous

PIKUL

(VERY NERVOUS)
Dont you think you could call me
Ted

GELLER
Maybe afterwards
Geller gently works her UmbyJack into Pikuls bioport She
locks her eyes onto his then squeezes her game-pods ON
teat Instantly her pod convulses and begins to flash and
spark and crackle White electronic smoke seeps from its
crevices and a kind of bioelectronic fat sputters from its
pores
Geller leaps up from the arm of the chair and rips her
UmbyJack out of Pikuls spine He cant feel it but the
furious force of her move twists him in his chair

GELLER

(FURIOUS)
Shit Pikul I cant believe
this I trusted you and you blew
my pod You must have neural-
surged

PIKUL
What do you mean

GELLER

(IN DESPAIR)
I jacked you into my pod and you
obviously panicked Now its
totally fucked This is a
disaster

PIKUL
I I was nervous but I didnt
panic
GELLER

(FIGHTING HYSTERIA)
I was forced to trust you and you
panicked and you neural-surged
and you blew my pod

PIKUL
You can get a new pod

GELLER
(her heart is breaking)
Pikul in this pod is the only
the original version of eXistenZ
an entire game system that cost
thirty-eight million to develop
not including pre-release
marketing costs And Im locked
outside of my own game I cant
get it out or me in

PIKUL
Are you serious This is the only
version that exists

GELLER
Security is everything these
days Its the only one and its
stuck inside and its your fault
Geller uses her sleeve to clean the drool off the pod with
tragic gentleness as though it were an injured child

GELLER
(fighting back tears)
Ive devoted my five most
passionate years to this strange
little creature And Ive never
regretted it Pikul because I
knew that it was the only thing
that could give my life any
meaning
PIKUL
But why is it my fault Im
telling you I didnt I did not
neural-surge I didnt I didnt
feel any surging
Gas strolls into the garage still wearing his work gloves
which now hold an agricultural-looking shotgun It is
levelled at Geller

GAS
It isnt your fault Its my
fault
Pikul looks at Gas in disbelief His feet begin to writhe in
circles but he still cant get out of the chair Geller
backs away from Gas clutching her pod protectively

GELLER

(QUIETLY)
Oh no Gas not you

GAS
I wouldnt try to use that
bioport again ‘cept maybe for a
toaster or something

GELLER
Whats going on

GAS
Youre worth a lot of money If
youre dead

PIKUL
What are you talking about

GAS
You know what Im talking about
Its all over the countryside
Five million for her dead body
No questions asked
PIKUL

But but she changed your
life

GAS
Yup And now Im gonna change
hers

PIKUL

(STALLING)
But wait Why did you install a

bad port into me

GAS
Seems theres a big bonus for
killing Allegra Gellers latest
game or whatever it is I think
I just did that didnt I
Geller decides to try another tack She stops backing away
and begins to slowly approach Gas

GELLER
But can you kill a person Can
you do that Gas Can you kill
me Hide my body Contact the
crazies Trust them to pay up
Hand over my now-decaying
fucking grotesque corpse Really
expect them to hand over 5 mil
cash Dont you ever go to the
fuckin movies

GAS
I like your script I want to be
in it
Gas cocks his shotgun Hes really going to do it Except
that Pikul shoots him right in the mastoid bone just behind
the ear with the bioport insertion gun The back of Gass
skull shatters and he goes down hard Pikul drops the gun
and launches himself out of his chair He falls to his knees
beside Gass body

PIKUL
Oh God I think hes dead I
thought I could just distract
him

GELLER
You did distract him
(to Gass body)
Plug your toaster into that hole
corpse

INT DEFENDER - NIGHT
Geller drives Pikul hangs on in the passenger seat

PIKUL
He wanted to kill you

GELLER
Yep

PIKUL
Thats two people in one day who
wanted to actually kill you

GELLER
Ive never been more popular

PIKUL
Allegra we need help

GELLER
Youre right Ive got to get
this pod fixed
EXT MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

The Defender winds its way up a heavily wooded mountain
road

EXT CALEDON SKI CLUB - DAY

The Defender turns off a dirt road and rumbles through an
open gate The stone gateposts bear a coy rustic sign which
reads CALEDON SKI CLUB - PRIVATE ROAD
INT DEFENDER - DAY

PIKUL
Were going skiing

GELLER
Nothing in the countryside is
what it seems Its all
appearance versus reality and
the reality here is something
unique

EXT CALEDON SKI CLUBHOUSE - DAY

The Defender pulls up beside the chalet-style ski clubhouse
As they get out of the truck the same bizarre insect that
Geller was playing with the night before lands on the
trucks side mirror narrowly missing Pikul as it flops
around in the air

PIKUL
Look at that huge bug Its got
two heads

GELLER
They breed them here Theyre not
supposed to get away
They get out and walk towards the clubhouse

PIKUL
What if somebody comes up here
and really wants to ski

GELLER
Nobody actually physically skis
any more Pikul You know that

PIKUL
Ive watched some ski shows
Downhill racing Austrian Alps

GELLER

(CONTEMPTUOUSLY)
Yeah right
INT CALEDON SKI CLUBHOUSE - DAY

Pikul and Geller enter the clubhouse There is nobody
around It looks like a real ski clubhouse complete with
racks of ski pants and ski boots But when Pikul examines
the goods he can see that theyre old and cracked and
falling apart Theyve been there for years

A man comes out of a back room early sixties authoritarian
air eastern-European He is Kiri Vinokur and he lights up
when he sees Geller

VINOKUR
My darling Allegra I am so
pleased to see you here
They embrace

GELLER
Kiri Vinokur this is my
bodyguard Ted Pikul

VINOKUR
Hello yes I heard the
ridiculous story about this fatwa
against you The company is
desperately trying to find you
Is it really serious Are you in
danger

PIKUL
If Im her bodyguard then shes
in grave danger

GELLER
There have been a couple of
attempts on my life already

VINOKUR

(SHOCKED )
No Thats unbearable The
company must stop this They owe
you every kind of protection

GELLER
I dont know if they can do
anything about it It seems to be
open season on me
VINOKUR

Well you will be safe here I
can assure you of that I will
contact Antenna right away and
have them send some people to
come and collect you

GELLER
Kiri no dont You mustnt let
anybody know were here unless
you have to I cant be sure that
Antenna is completely safe for
me

VINOKUR
I understand Yes The company
draws many eccentric people into
its fold You can hide in one of
the guest chalets As long as you
like I will make sure you get
fresh towels
Geller pats her game-pod case

GELLER
-and make sure I dont lose
everything I have in here

INT WORKSHOP CHALET - DAY

In the strange atmosphere of the workshop chalet Vinokur is
taking Gellers pod apart It is more like surgery on an
alien life form than computer electronics The room feels
like a weird combination of a hi-tech operating room and a

woodworking class

A cherubic middle-aged man - Landry - who looks more like a

farmhand than an electronics technician

he works

VINOKUR
What did you port into

GELLER
Pikuls bioport

assists Vinokur as
VINOKUR
Really Thats what did all the
damage

PIKUL
It was a flawed installation - my
first It it neural-surged

Allegra says you can fix it

VINOKUR
It fried some very expensive
nerve boards See Here These
are kaput Its a complex thing

PIKUL
Nerve boards

VINOKUR
We use the nervous systems of
specially-bred insects to create
the electronic circuits on our
motherboards

(SMILES)
Only Antenna Research has it

PIKUL
Wow And where do the batteries
go

VINOKUR
Very funny

GELLER
Hes not kidding Hes a total PR
nerd

(TO PIKUL)
It ports into you and you are
the power source Your body your
nervous system Your energy When
you get tired run down it wont
run properly
VINOKUR
Landry here will finish up the
pod-work Meanwhile

(TO PIKUL)
Lets get that nasty bioport out
of you and get a nice fresh one
in there We have guest chalets
out back Youre both welcome to
stay Now where did I put my
bioport-plug puller Here it
is
Vinokur hauls out a device that looks like a pair of spring-
loaded fire tongs

VINOKUR

(TO PIKUL)
Lie down on that couch and pull
up your shirt

INT GUEST CHALET - NIGHT

In their chalet a cozy and inn-likespace Pikul and Geller
examine his new bioport while sitting on one of the chalets
twin beds The region around the port looks swollen bruised
and tender

PIKUL
It hurts I think its infected

GELLER
Its not infected Its just
excited It wants action
She attempts to jack her pod into his port using the Y-
shaped UmbyCord but he twists away from her

PIKUL
But I really dont think that I
want action Me I mean The
bearer of the excited bioport
What I want is not now Not
here I feel too too exposed
Geller sighs then switches into her explaining-the-facts-
of-life-to-a-child mode They are both aware that they are
replaying an earlier moment

GELLER
(cradling her pod)
My baby here has now taken three
major hits one in the church
one in the gas station and one
on the operating table The only
way I can tell if everythings OK
- the games not been
contaminated the pods not
fucked - is to play eXistenZ with
somebody friendly Are you
friendly or are you not
Pikul swallows nervously then turns his back to Geller so
that she can port in

PIKUL
Youre telling me this thing will
run off my bodys energy

GELLER

(PORTING IN)
Thats how they work See Youre
hummin along already
Sure enough he is Geller deftly twists the second jack
into her own bioport and takes a deep breath

GELLER
All right eXistenZ Only from
Antenna Here we go

PIKUL

(APPREHENSIVE)
Youve got a bit of an unfair
advantage dont you How can I
possibly compete with the
designer of the system

GELLER
You could beat the guy who
invented poker couldnt you
Geller flicks the game-pod nipple and the chalet begins to
melt away around them

INT GAME STORE - NIGHT

The chalet melts away and is replaced by a scruffy game
store A lot of kids and strange adults mill around amongst
the dusty racks and pinball machines examining packages of
weird games and game devices muttering secretively to each
other and it is amongst these dull rows of shelves that
Pikul and Geller find themselves standing

A cashier works away behind an old-fashioned cash register
that sits on a tall counter The cashier a gangly sallow
young man glances at Pikul and Geller suspiciously from
time to time

Pikul feels himself his clothes moves his arms his
tongue He feels around behind him but there is no game-pod
or UmbyCord in sight

PIKUL
That was beautiful I feel
just like me Is that kind of
transition normal a kind of
smooth dissolve from place to
place

GELLER
Depends on the style of the game
You can get jagged brutal cuts
slow fades shimmering little

morphs

PIKUL
This is amazing I had no idea
We were still ourselves but

were in the game Where are we

GELLER
Its basically a game store I
used to hang out in as a kid

PIKUL

(ENCHANTED)
Are you serious

GELLER
Were ported into a game-pod
together remember eXistenZ has
complete access to both our
central nervous systems Its game
architecture will be based on our
memories our anxieties our
preoccupations

PIKUL

(DISENCHANTED)
Are you serious

GELLER
You keep saying that
(examines a game-pak)
Look at this Games Ive never
heard of Biological Father Hit
By A Car Viral Ecstasy Chinese
Restaurant
(reads pak back)
In Viral Ecstasy you are a
virus invading a specific human
body You create ingenious viral
strategies to cope with the
efforts of the bodys immune
system to destroy you

PIKUL
Wait a minute That reminds me
What precisely is the goal of the
game were playing now I mean
the rules the objective
Nobodys ever really said
anything about what you have to
do in eXistenZ

GELLER
The beauty of eXistenZ is that it
changes every time you play it
It adapts to the individuals who
are actually playing it The
result is that you have to play
the game to find out why youre
playing the game
PIKUL
But thats kind of cheating
isnt it Not to say confusing

GELLER
Not at all Its a much more
organic approach to gaming than
classic arbitrary rule-
dominated games Its the future
Pikul Youll see how natural it
feels

PIKUL

(DISTRACTED )
Look at this Could this be the
future too
(picks up a game-pod)
Ever see anything like this
before
They are looking at a game-pod in a gel-pak that is even
weirder than a tissue-pod It has a logo and a name -

CORTICAL SYSTEMATICS

Suddenly a hand reaches into the frame and takes the pak
away puts it neatly back on the rack

Pikul and Geller look up at a man in his early fifties
graying thinning hair beefy generally harried and
pugnacious air The man is Dorsey Nader

NADER
These are delicate You have to
be careful

PIKUL
Yes I can imagine

NADER
Cortical Systematics is the
latest and the hottest Not just
a new game but a new system

GELLER
Will it work with an industry
standard bioport

NADER
(ignores her question)
I havent seen you two before
have I This is my place
Haimische isnt it Funky

PIKUI
Were new in town

NADER
Welcome to Dorsey Naders Game
Emporium Im Dorsey Nader Is
there anything I can help you
with

GELLER
Were just looking

NADER

(FURTIVELY)
I have what youre looking for

PIKUL
You do

NADER
Follow me
Nader turns his back on them and walks to the back of the
store He stops at a warped and dirty door turns beckons
to them urgently trying not to be noticed by the
preoccupied patrons
As Pikul and Geller follow Nader through the door they do
not escape the notice of the sour-faced young cashier who
writes something down hurriedly on a pad with an air of
vengeful self-importance

INT STOCKROOM GAME STORE - NIGHT
Pikul and Geller find themselves in a stockroom jammed to

overflowing with packaged and naked game-related
merchandise They are alone with Nader and they are all
sitting on wooden crates

Nader rummages on the shelves behind him for a moment then
turns back to them with a gel-pak in his hands He studies
them for a moment hefting the gel-pak in his hand

NADER

(PAUSE)
Who sent you

PIKUL

(INSTANT RESPONSE)
Its none of your businesz who
sent us Were here and thats
all that matters

Pikul is shocked at his own response He turns to Geller in
horror worried that hes blown the game already

PIKUL
Oh God what happened I didnt
mean to say that

GELLER

(GIGGLING)
Its your character who said it
Its a kind of schizophrenic
feeling isnt it But youll get
used to it There are things that
have to be said to advance the
plot and establish the
characters and those things get
said whether you want to say them
or not Dont fight it Just go
with it

PIKUL
But should you be saying that in
front of him Nader

GELLER
Look at him
Pikul does Nader doesnt seem to have heard him In fact
he doesnt respond at all other than to hum the Antenna
Research corporate-song and tap his fingers repetitively
caught in a small behavioural loop Geller chuckles at
Pikuls confusion

PIKUL

(RE NADER)
Whats he doing

GELLER
Hes gone into a game loop hes
locked up and he wont come out
of it until you give him a proper
game line of dialogue

PIKUL
This is tricky

GELLER
Start by repeating your last
line Include his name so he
knows youre talkingto him

4-

PIKUL
Were here Dorsey Nader and
thats all that matters
Nader immediately comes out of his loop He chuckles

NADER
Youre right That is all tha
matters
Pikul smiles delighted Now he takes a deep breath closes
his eyes relaxes The line comes

PIKUL
Well Nader you said you had
what we want Were waiting

NADER
Youre going to need these micro-
pods to download your new
identities I assume that you
both have had those industry
standard bioports you mentioned
installed

GELLER
Yes of course thats right We
both have bioports
Here she pauses looks at Pikul

GELLER
We do dont we

PIKUL
I assumed we did I mean here
In the game Of course we might
not

GELLER
Wed better check
While Nader goes into game lock-up Geller lifts up her
shirt Pikul takes a look Her bioport is there although
slightly rougher puckered more organic than in non-game
life

PIKUL
Yeah its there Looks a little
different but its there
Geller grabs Pikuls shirt and lifts it His is there too

GELLER
I see what you mean

(TO NADER)
Yes we both have bioports

NADER

(UNLOCKING)
Good Port in and thisll tell
you all you need to know for now
Pikul and Geller examine the pak which bears the Cortical
Systematics name and logo It seems to be a miniature
version of their real-life game-pod
NADER
Im going to leave while you
finish up here It wouldnt be
good for us all to be seen
together
Nader gets up to leave pauses at the door

NADER
Dont do anything I wouldnt do
Nader chuckles a very theatrical chuckle then leaves

PIKUL
I assume that Nader is our entry
point into the game

GELLER
Yeah Kinda disappointing

PIKUL
Nader

GELLER
Yeah Not a very well-drawn
character And his dialogue was
just so-so

PIKUL
Yeah

(PAUSE)
Do we blame ourselves for that
The bad dialogue Or would it be
bad no matter who was ported in

GELLER
The game engine is just getting
used to us Itll get more daring
once it warms up

Geller fumbles the micro-pod out of its vacuum-pak shell
She reads the instructions on the back
GELLER
OK The pods are so small they
plug directly into the bioport
Geller delicately twists the end of the micro-pod into
Pikuls bioport The micro-pod changes colour pulses
ripples and then slowly flows and wriggles its way into
Pikuls bioport until it has completely disappeared

GELLER
God

PIKUL
What happened

GELLER

The whole pod just disappeared
into your back

PIKUL

(PANICKY)
It disappeared into my back
It its in my spine Its
winding its way around my spinal
cord

GELLER

Dont panic its just a game Do
you feel anything yet

PIKUL
(controlling his fear)
No I dont Not a thing I dont
feel a thing Uh do you want me
to do you
They change positions Pikul ports in the micro-pod and it
duly crawls its way into Gellers bioport Tenderly as
though kissing a cut to make it better Pikul kisses her
back low near her bioport Geller whirls around with sudden
anger

GELLER
What the hell was that

PIKUL

(CONFUSED)
That wasnt me That was my game
character I wouldnt have done
that Not here anyway
She pauses then kisses him on the mouth hard
GELLER
Youre right Our characters are
obviously supposed to jump on
each other Probably to create
emotional tension when danger
happens No use fighting it

PIKUL

(FIGHTING IT)
What about our new identities Do
you feel yours yet

GELLER

(CARESSING)
Theyll take care of themselves

PIKUL

(PAUSE)
Im very worried about my body
Geller stops sits up

GELLER
Your what

PIKUL
I mean where are our real
bodies Are they all right Are
they hungry What if theres
danger

GELLER
(kissing and caressing

AGAIN)
Theyre just where we left them
sitting quietly eyes closed
Just like meditating

PIKUL
(reluctantly kissing and
CARESSING BACK)
I dont know I feel really
vulnerable Disembodied

GELLER
Dont sweat it All your senses
are still operating Youll pop
right out of the game if theres
a problem
They begin to make seriously hot love amrngst the game paks
and cartons of replacement UmbyCords And then the game
store melts away around them

INT TROUT FARM ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY

Pikul finds himself sitting at an immensely long bench in
the process of assembling insect motherboards along with
many other workers Pikul can still feel the warmth of
Gellers body but shes nowhere to be seen A gritty
narrow conveyor belt runs down the middle of the bench upon
which floats an endless stream of motherboard parts which
the workers pick off as they need them The belt begins and
ends in the anonymous smoky innards of the building

The place a high-ceilinged pre-fab long and narrow with
hundreds of blanked-out windows houses a game-pod assembly
line Pikul looks down to find himself wearing a photo-ID
card clipped to his shirt pocket that tells him he is
somebody named LARRY ASHEN He has to twist the card around
because of course from his vantage point it is upside
down

NOURISH
Tryin to remember who you are
Pikul snaps his head up to see a long-haired morose-looking
worker sitting next to him snickering Mocking Pikul he
twists his own card around comically bunching up his work
shirt so he can read his own name which is YEVGENY NOURISH

NOURISH
Hey it works I must be Yevgeny
Nourish
Nourish leans over to squint at Pikuls name tag

NOURISH
bb»

And you you are new to the
Trout Farm

PIKUL
Yes I Im very new Did
you say trout farm

NOURISH
You know - raise baby trout from
eggs and then stock the rivers
with them

(BROAD GESTURE)
Entire place used to be a trout
farm Seems like most everything
used to be something else
doesnt it

Pikul looks around him The place is humming but Geller is
still nowhere in sight The workers are small-town locals

a wide range of ages

Pikul looks down at his own hands which seem to know what
to do place glue on the boards glue them down to a resin
frame using a template insert needle-like electrodes into
the bodies of certain epoxied insects The insect boards
Pikul notes are actually whole insects coated in epoxy and
frozen together like a sick collage At least here in the
game they are

Pikul is now automatically doing flashy moves with the odd
materials in front of him with great dexterity Nourish
takes note of this

NOURISH
I (with admiration)
You might be new but you seem to
know what youre doing

PIKUL

(GENUINELY PERPLEXED)
It surprises me more than it
surprises you
Nourish moves back to the insect motherboard that he has
been working on then leans over again exactly as he did the
first time It has the effect of an instant replay but not
in slow-motion

NOURISH

(WITH ADMIRATION)
You might be new but you seem to
know what youre doing
Pikul realizes he hasnt given the right answer He now just
lets it come without thinking

PIKUL
I ah Ive been trained by the
very best
Nourish unlocks and looks around with a delicate
furtiveness

NOURISH

(FURTIVE)
So have I Where do you plan to
have lunch

PIKUL
Im new here I have no plans for
lunch

NOURISH 11

I suggest the Chinese restaurant
in the forest Everybody knows
where it is Just ask

PIKUL
Wont you be going there too

NOURISH
I have other plans for lunch But
I do suggest that you order the
special And dont take no for an
answer

PIKUL
All right Ill do that
Nourish turns back to his task and begins to work away as
though Pikul didnt exist

Pikul takes this cue to go back to his own board and is soon
preoccupied with testing the boards circuits by porting it
into a test UmbyCord that uncoils from the center of the
bench His strange reverie watching himself work on auto-
pilot at this bizarre task is soon interrupted by a worker
pushing a canvas and metal cart with bicycle wheels The
worker parks the cart behind Pikul and taps him on the
shoulder

WORKER
Larry
PIKUL
(STARTLED)
Yes
WORKER

They need this in the back room

They asked for you

The worker shuffles off leaving the cart behind him Pikul
turns to Nourish

PIKUL
Whats that mean

NOURISH

(GESTURES)
It means that they want you in
the back room They need more
insect boards for the pod
assembly bays

PIKUL
Should I just get up and go
there

NOURISH

Yeah Ill take care of your

incoming boards

Pikul gets up to go Nourish grabs him by the arm and
whispers intensely
Remember
for lunch

I order th

Pikuls expression shows that there is a return game line

Perversely

He told me

PIKUL
where to have lunch

out anyway

EXT CHINESE RESTAURANT IN THE WOODS - DAY
A ragged stream of pod-assembly workers trickles along a
densely wooded gravel path towards a very un-Chinese
Victorian red-brick farmhouse A small river flows not more
than fifty feet from the restaurant mimicking the movement
of the line of workers

The workers all file past a sign on the lawn in front of the
building which reads MONA ZHANGS BEIJING CUISINE

INT CHINESE RESTAURANT IN THE WOODS - DAY

Pikul and Geller are seated at a round Formica-covered table
with a lazy Susan serving wheel in the centre of it all
very Mandarin in style Other workers sit sullenly at their
table wordless suspicious

A restaurant dog a mongrel with a lot a heavy collie-like
fur lies basking in a pane of sunlight in a corner

The waiter a young athletic Chinese man comes over
bringing rice and tea

WAITER
We have nice sea bass today
Shall I bring it for everyone
Pikul and Geller exchange a look Pikul shrugs OK

PIKUL
We want the special
The waiter looks stunned The others at their table look
distressed The waiter seems to lock up almost freeze-
framed

PIKUL
Did you hear me Chinese waiter

(SLOWLY)
We want the special
The waiter unfreezes smiles grimly

WAITER
The special is for special
occasions I cannot give you the
special

PIKUL
But this is a special occasion

Its

Pikul pauses waiting for the proper game line to
materialize in his mouth Finally it does He gestures
towards Geller

PIKUL
Its her birthday
The waiter locks up for a moment then unfreezes

WAITER
A birthday is a special occasion
I will therefore bring the
special for everybody
The waiter walks away The others at the table get up and
move away drift over to other tables with occasional
furtive backward glances at Pikul and Geller

PIKUL
I guess the special isnt very
popular

GELLER
I guess

PIKUL

But you know really dont you
You dont have to guess I mean
its your game your little
universe

GELLER
I dont know You have to
understand that to understand
what weve really created with
eXistenZ

PIKUL
Youre telling me for example
that you dont know what the
special is

GELLER
Correct I dont
PIKUL
Or why we ordered it

GELLER
We ordered it because another
game character told you to
Thats a clue we cant ignore
But thats just basic games
playing

PIKUL
I want to put the game on pause

Geller just looks at him puzzled

PIKUL

(PANICKING)
The game can be paused cant it
I mean all games can be paused
right

GELLER
Sure yeah but why Whats
wrong Arent you dying to see
whats special about the special

PIKUL
Im feeling a little disconnected
from my real life Im kind of
losing touch with the texture of
it you know what I mean I mean
I actually think theres an
element of psychosis involved
here I mean I dont know where
my body really is or where
reality is what Ive actually
done or not done

GELLER
Thats a great sign It means
your nervous system is fully
engaging with the game
architecture The game is a lot
more fun when it starts to feel
realer than real

Pikul panics
PIKUL

(PAUSE)
Yeah
Pikul stands up and screams at the top of his lungs

PIKUL

(SCREAMS )
eXistenZ is paused
The Chinese restaurant melts away

INT GUEST CHALET - DAY

The guest chalet melts back up around them Pikul looks
around They are still sitting on the bed ported into
Gellers pod together

PIKUL
Did I do that I guess I did

GELLER
So how does it feel

PIKUL
What

GELLER
Your real life The one you came
back for

PIKUL

Just sitting here it feels
completely unreal Im sure you
knew that would happen

GELLER
Youre stuck now arent you You
want to go back to the Chinese
restaurant because theres
nothing happening here Were
safe Its boring

PIKUL
Worse than that Im not sure
here where we are is real at
all This feels like the game
And you youre beginning to
tl feel a bit like a game character
to me

(MORE)

PIKUL (CONTD)

(PAUSE)
Did we really make love to each
other

GELLER

(SHARP)
Definitely not

PIKUL
It feels like we did

GELLER
Our characters did Im sure it
would be very different if we
did

PIKUL
I Im actually just like that
in real life You got the real
Ted Pikul there in the stockroom
of the game store

GELLER
Well you didnt get the real
Allegra Geller I can tell you
that no

PIKUL
I didnt
She kisses him gently

GELLER
No In real life I tend to lose
control It can get messy
(PAUSE)
Lets go back
Pikul looks down at the pod He flicks the PLAY nipple The
room melts down around them and is replaced by the Chinese
restaurant

INT CHINESE RESTAURANT IN THE WOODS - DAY

Pikul and Geller are back at their table in the Chinese
restaurant The waiter is approaching their table He
proudly sets down a series of dishes on the lazy Susan

6c

WAITER
Special order for the birthday
girl Hope you enjoy it very
much
In the dishes are a variety of cooked reptiles amphibians
fish and birds all weirdly mutated and presented in a
bizarrely beautiful fashion

PIKUL
I think Ive lost my appetite

WAITER

A shame Mutant creatures provide
new and previously unimagined
taste sensations

(SIGNIFICANTLY)
Shall I clear all this away
Geller sees that this is a crucial game moment

GELLER
No it looks terrific Thank you
Were happy
The waiter nods

WAITER
Very good Enjoy
The waiter leaves Geller watches him go suspicious When
she turns back to Pikul she is shocked to see that he has
served out most of the creatures to himself and is avidly
stripping the meat off their bones

GELLER
Pikul what are you doing

PIKUL
I dont know I find this
disgusting but I cant help
myself

GELLER
Oh good
Pikul looks up from his big bowl which is rapidly filling
with creature parts His fingers areslimy and sticky but
he doesnt stop his fingers working expertly on their own

PIKUL
Good You think this is good

( AM-

O

GELLER
Yeah Its a genuine game urge
Its something that your game
character was born to do Dont
fight it

PIKUL
I am fighting it but it isnt
doing me any good
Pikul is now snapping together bits and pieces of bone
gristle and flesh a grotesque Lego set When hes finished
hes made a gun very much like the one that was used in the
attempted assassination in the church

PIKUL
Omigod this looks awfully
familiar You sure this is OK

GELLER

(NOT SURE)
It should be OK

Now Pikul reaches into his mouth pulls out a bridge of
three teeth - one of them gold-filled - and loads them into
the gristly magazine

GELLER
Do you have that bridge in real
life

PIKUL

Absolutely not My teeth are
perfect Dont ask me how I knew
this thing was in my mouth

GELLER
It probably wasnt until you
ordered the special
He slaps the magazine into the handle then pulls the slide
back and releases it so that there is now a toothy round in
the chamber
Then with a smile Pikul points the weapon at Geller

PIKUL

(CASUALLY)
Death to the demoness Allegra
Geller

GELLER

(suddenly very uncertain)
Thats not funny

Pikul looks at Geller and sees that there is genuine terror
in her eyes

PIKUL
Sorry I couldnt resist But you
know I do feel the urge to

kill someone here
Geller grips the edge of her bowl of hot-and-sour soup - the
handiest weapon she has

GELLER

(TENSING)
Who

PIKUL
I need to kill our waiter

GELLER

(RELIEVED)
Oh well that makes sense

(CALLS OUT)
Waiter Waiter

(TO PIKUL)
When he comes over do it Dont
hesitate

PIKUL

But everything in this game is so
realistic I dont think I really
could

GELLER
You wont be able to stop You
might as well enjoy it

PIKUL
Free will is obviously not a
big factor in this little world
of ours

GELLER
Its like real life - theres
just enough to make it
interesting
- Pikul spots the waiter making his way across the room
towards them a big smile on his face

PIKUL

Hes too nice I wont do it
The waiter arrives at their table

WAITER
What can I do to make your lunch
more pleasant
Pikul lifts the gun and points it at the waiter

PIKUL
I found this in my soup and Im
very upset
Pikul fires The tooth-bullet hits the waiter in the
heekbone A chunk of the waiters cheekbone comes off and
is head jerks back like a fighter taking a stiff jab
he waiters sweet face instantly transforms into a hideous
ngry snarling mask of hatred He pulls a meat cleaver out
f his jacket
eller immediately throws her bowl of hot-and-sour soup into
he waiters face The waiter screams then wildly wipes the
oodles and goop out of his eyes He raises the cleaver over
is head
he waiter swings and lunges across the table managing only
to hack the tip of the gun off Pikul is shocked to see the
gun begin to bleed The waiter sprawling across the table
screams as he tries to reach Geller with his cleaver Pikul

HrodtagowHaa

fires into the waiters shrieking open mouth - a tooth-
bullet into teeth

A piece of the waiters skull comes off like a piece of
coconut the gold-filled tooth now flattened and embedded in
it The gun is bleeding all over Pikuls hand now He drops
it in disgust

The restaurant dog comes out of nowhere picks the gun up
and runs off with it under a table where he crouches down
and starts to gnaw on it growling

Pikul stands up shakily begins to become aware of the
strange tense stillness of the other patrons in the
restaurant

PIKUL
(loudly to room)
Sts all right just a little
misunderstanding over the check
Pay no attention and enjoy your
meal
To his surprise the patrons actually turn back to their
meals albeit with a certain sinister reluctance
Pikul looks around wildly
PIKUL
I feel a serious game urge to get
out of here
Through the porthole in one of the pair of metal-clad
kitchen doors Geller spots someone wearing a chefs hat
someone who is wildly beckoning to them

GELLER
Through the kitchen That way

INT KITCHEN CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY

Geller and Pikul enter the kitchen and take a look around
There are mutant amphibians and reptiles hung up everywhere
in bowls and on chopping blocks The kitchen workers have
all turned to look at the intruders

Suddenly a cook steps forward from around the door We can
now see that it is Nourish in a chefs outfit

NOURISH
Did you like the meal I prepared
for you
PIKUL
Yes It was very revealing
NOURISH

It certainly was for me You both
passed our little test with
flying colours

GELLER
Why did the Chinese waiter have
to die

NOURISH

A waiter hears many things spoken
when people are relaxed and
eating A waiter has many
opportunities for betrayal

PIKUL
He betrayed you

NOURISH
He betrayed us Out this way
quickly
They go out a side door and find themselves walking along
the river that links the Chinese restaurant and the Trout
Farm

EXT THE RIVER - DAY

The trio walk along the bank of the river that feeds the
Trout Farm Nourish points out a connected series of rock-
lined internally-lighted pools some stagnant like ponds
and some clear with river water running through them

NOURISH
See there the breeding pools
The pools are all alive with strange creatures mutated
fish amphibians and along the small muddy terraces that
border the pools reptiles Like the dysfunctional insect at
the gas station these creatures do not work very well They
float and swim belly up lie on their sides at the bottom of
their pools flop and flounder around and in general
ostentatiously fail to function

PIKUL
Is that where you caught todays
special

NOURISH

(LAUGHS)

The restaurant is controlled by
us We raise these mutant
creatures as food and that is our
cover but of course we are also
raising them as components for
undetectable and hypoallergenic
weapons Right under the noses of
our enemies And speaking of our
enemies its important that you
go back to work at Cortical
Systematics We need to maintain
as many agents there as we can
Ill take care of the mess at the
restaurant

GELLER
The Trout Farm is owned by
Cortical Systematics

NOURISH
Yes

(MORE )

oc
NOURISH (CONTD)

(BITTERLY)
Their corporate slogan should be
Enemies of Reality
A glazed look comes over Pikul He begins to speak like a
robotic orator

PIKUL

(ROBOT-LIKE)
Reality is a fragile thing Most
people think that reality must of
course be the most solid thing
but it isnt Reality is
threatened now more than ever It
is being eroded and it is
washing away in the deforming
storm of non-reality which
masquerades as reality and
eventually replaces it Deformed
and crippled and limping and
hideous threatening to engulf us
all
Geller looks at Pikul in admiring disbelief

GELLER

(SOTTO VOCE)
Where did that come from

PIKUL
The game made me do it
GELLER
Im impressed

Nourish is also impressed He smiles broadly then takes

Pikul in his arms and hugs him then Geller
NOURISH

(PASSIONATE)
We love you two now now that you
have proven to be true and
trustworthy Realists Well be in
touch
Nourish turns around and walks back-towards the

PIKUL
Enemies of Reality Or does it
really mean enemies of eXistenZ
Are the Realists the game-life
version of the Anti-
eXistenZialists desperately
want to kill you

s

GELLER
I wouldnt take it too seriously

PIKUL 1
Of course you wouldnt But maybe
you should

(PAUSE)

But why is the name Cortical
Systematics familiar

GELLER
We saw it everywhere in Dorsey
Naders game store remember

PIKUL
Yes So that makes it the game-
life version of our own company
Cortical Systematics is
equivalent to Antenna Research in

restaurant
the real world

GELLER
Thats probably fair to say

PIKUL
So then do we meekly go back to
work and say nothing It sounds
as though Nourish and his
Realists are preparing to
sabotage the Trout Farm Before
you know it theyll be planning
to assassinate game designers

GELLER
Were just characters in here
Dont mix your real-life
loyalties into it or youll lose
for sure

PIKUL
Then what do we do next

INT GAME STORE - NIGHT

We are close on a Cortical Systematics logo on a game-pak
As Pikul and Geller pretend to examine the merchandise they
scan the game store for Nader The store is quite crowded -
same style of customers maybe even some of the same faces
different clothes They dont see Nader

Geller goes up to the cashier the same gangly sallow
bespectacled young man who was there the first time

O

GELLER
Im looking for Dorsey Nader Is
he here

CASHIER

Say that again

GELLER
Is Dorsey Nader here
The cashier glances around the store then locks the
register

CASHIER
Come with me Hes in the back
The cashier leads them through the store towards the
stockroom door As they move amongst the customers both
Pikul and Geller feel that they are being scutinized
carefully by shoppers who turn their eyes away from them at
the last moment so that they cant be absolutely certain
And as for us - have we glimpsed some characters from the
game that we have already seen Possibly even Wittold Levi
from the first scene in the church and Frances the limo
driver and Gas We arent positive

INT STOCKROOM GAME STORE - NIGHT

The cashier closes the door behind them then gestures
towards the back of the stockroom

CASHIER
You want him there he is
Nader lies dead the unnatural purple of his face eerily
matched by the veiny purple streaks in the UmbyCord around
his neck

PIKUL
Migod

GELLER
What happened
In response the cashier starts rummaging around on one of
the shelves He soon finds what he was looking for and
turns around to face them In his hand is a grotesque
slightly chewed gristle gun - the one Pikul assembled in the
Chinese restaurant - in his hand

CASHIER
You shouldnt have killed the
Chinese waiter

PIKUL
Why not
CASHIER
He was your contact at the Trout
Farm A damn good man
(pause he waggles the gun)
His dog brought me this
The cashier toys with the guns claw-like hammer

PIKUL
But we were contacted there by
Yevgeny Nourish He seemed to
know exactly who we were

CASHIER
Thats because Nader tipped him
off that you were coming Nader
was a mole for Cortical

Systematics

GELLER
Youre with the Realist
underground

CASHIER

Yes I was placed here to keep an
eye on Nader
The cashier puts the gun back on the shelf

PIKUL
If Nourish isnt our real
contact who is he

CASHIER
Nourish is a double agent for
Cortical Systematics He was
working with Nader to subvert the
Realist cause and doing it
rather well

(SNORTS CONTEMPTUOUSLY)
After all he got you to
assassinate your own contact But
now youre going to put a stop to
him
PIKUL
We are

CASHIER
I assume that you both have had
spinal port inserts bioports

installed
PIKUL

We do
CASHIER
(PASSIONATE)

Do you both realize that neither
of you can be buried on hallowed
ground because of these these
mutilations Does your bioport
manual tell you that

GELLER
Are you trying to talk us into
having them removed

CASHIER
No no In fact you would be
useless to us without them We
Realists are forbidden to have
them and so we have to use
people like you on occasion

GELLER
I dont understand Are you
wanting us to jack a game into
our bioports

CASHIER
Game No Not a game A weapon
(a creepy smile)
You go back to the Trout Farm
and in a familiar place you find
a mouldy old wicker basket with a
thread-bare canvas cover

PIKUL
How will we know what to do

CASHIER
(an even creepier smile)
Even a child would know what to
do
Someone begins to knock loudly on a door very near by The
cashier is oblivious butboth Pikul and Geller hear it The
stockroom begins to morph away as its objects are replaced
one at a time by chalet objects

INT GUEST CHALET - NIGHT
Someone is knocking at the chalet door

VINOKUR (0 S )

Sorry to interrupt you kids but

thought youd better have

something to eat We knocked on

your door a few times to invite

you to dinner

Pikul and Geller sit on the bed game-pod between them
UmbyCord joining them to each other and to the pod They
look at each other Pikul shrugs

GELLER

Come on in

The door opens slowly to reveal Vinokur who stands there
uncertainly holding a large tray

VINOKUR
and when we got no answer I
figured you were playing eXistenZ
to try out your new pod and your
new bioport Everythings all
right I take it
An awkward moment as though Vinokur has caught the pair
having illicit sex Vinokur moves into the room towards the
table

VINOKUR
Can I leave this here for you
Dont bother unporting I just
had to be sure our star designer
was in a good place and that
shed recovered her multi-
million-dollar game system from
her defective pod
Vinokur puts down the tray which holds several plates
covered by smaller inverted plates to keep the food warm
GELLER
Thanks so much Kiri This is
very sweet of you

VINOKUR
I

(AWKWARD PAUSE)
So I take it she has

GELLER
Has what

VINOXUR
Recovered eXistenZ

GELLER
Oh yes sure Thats why were
so spaced out

(TO PIKUL)
We were right into it werent
we

PIKUL
Yeah we were And its amazing

VINOKUR
Well thats a relief Ill leave
you two alone You can leave the
tray outside your door when
youre finished

PIKUL
What is that youve brought

VINOKUR
Believe it or not its Chinese
food Theres a great Chinese
restaurant on the other side of
the escarpment road
Vinokur turns to go
GELLER
Kiri

VINOKUR
Yes

GELLER
Have you heard anything yet I
mean about the eXistenZ test
seminar and the shooting

VINOKUR
Oh yes Its come over all the
media now Youve never been more
famous Your face is everywhere
which of course justmakes it
worse I
(a disturbed pause)

GELLER
What Tell me

VINOKUR
Theyve announced the possibility
that Antenna will delay the
release of your new system
indefinitely until they can
determine how widespread support
for this fanatical group really
is I dont approve myself I
dont think we should bend one
degree to extremists

GELLER
Support for the fanatics What
does that mean

VINOKUR
Well you know Theyre all
coming out of the woodwork now

GELLER
Who is
VINOKUR
(heavy defeated sigh)
A lot of people are taking the
opportunity to jump on the anti-
game bandwagon Theyve now heard
rumours about what the eXistenZ
system is and they say weve
gone too far psychologically
medically socially you name it
And Im afraid I wouldnt put it
past our competitors to be
involved in this to try to whip
up public opinion and kill our
new system before it gets born

(PAUSE)
Youre sure you dont want me to
contact Antenna even just to see
what they have to say

GELLER

(SHAKEN)
Not yet Kiri Thanks
Vinokur smiles gently and leaves

PIKUL
(gesturing towards the

DOOR)
Your friend Vinokur is getting
shaky I think hes going to turn
you in to Antenna

GELLER
Sounds like you might approve of
that

PIKUL
It might be the safest thing Are
you hungry

GELLER
Are you kidding
PIKUL
Me neither Im terrified to look
under the plates

(PAUSE)
This support for the fanatics
thing doesnt sound too good
Maybe we should stop

GELLER
We cant stop Ive been noticing
some new glitches Im not

sure what they mean Im not sure
the game is OK

PIKUL

(GENTLY)
Listen to be honest I find your
game very confusing Im not sure
I want to go back in there
because Im not convinced Im
going to keep coming out Do you
really like that feeling

GELLER

(WITH PASSION)
Yeah I love it

(DELICIOUSLY MUSING)
When eXistenZ is released its
gonna wipe the competition off
the face of the earth

PIKUL
Will it

GELLER
It really will do that yes

(HEAVY PAUSE)
Dont hurt me Pikul Dont make
me go back in alone Play with
me

PIKUL
Allegra Im worried that your
game will wipe me off the face of
the earth Im thinking I was
right never to have a bioport
installed

GELLER
(sly quick smile)
But you have one now And youre
ported in
She mischievously flicks the pod nipple and the chalet
melts away around them

INT TROUT FARM SECURITY - DAY

Trout-farm workers shuffle along a murky pre-fab corridor
towards a smoke-enshrouded security checkpoint A puffy-
faced woman with a clipboard is walking down the lineup
checking faces and ID cards With her we discover Pikul and
Geller once again wearing their ID cards which identify
them as LARRY ASHEN and BARB BRECKEN

PIKUL
That was cruel I dont want to
be here

GELLER

t wasnt cruel it was
desperate Cmon Pikul Youve
just got a bad case of first-time
user anxiety

PIKUL

dont like it here I dont
now whats going on Were
blundering around together in
this unformed world whose rules
and objectives are largely
unknown seemingly
indecipherable or even Possibly
non-existent always on the verge
of being killed by forces we
dont understand

GELLER
That sounds like my game all
right
They are now close enough to the security cubicleat the end
of the corridor to see the workers ahead of them being
frisked by hand then scanned by a wand similar to the one
that Pikul used at the church

PIKUL
That sounds like a game thats
not going to be easy to market

GELLER

(LAUGHS)
But its a game that everybodys
already playing Existence its
wonderful

INT TROUT FARM ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY

Pikul and Geller have passed through security and now enter
the assembly-line arena They see Nourish at his accustomed
place on the line hunched over a pile of insect
motherboards and now seeming somehow menacing predatory
in profile The pair skirt the assembly-line area carefully
scanning as they go but there is no wicker basket to be
seen

INT TROUT FARM ASSEMBLY BAYS - DAY

Pikul and Geller walk down the aisle connecting the assembly
bays Other workers drift casually in and out preparing for
their day in a desultory fashion

PIKUL

The cashier said it would be ina
familiar place Is there such a
thing here

GELLER

My assembly bay

They make their way to the last assembly bay and slip inside
it There is for the moment nobody else there but several
pods have been left on the work tables half-assembled

Pikul spots it first in the far corner a large mouldy
wicker basket in the opposite corner Something lumpy in it
is covered by a thread-bare canvas sheet

PIKUL
Is that it over there
They stroll over to the basket Geller kneels down and
carefully begins to unwrap it while Pikul stands guard

GELLER
Id say its exactly as
advertised
The final wrap comes off In the basket is a necrotic
purpled very diseased-looking pod

PIKUL
God its ugly Even for a game-
pod

GELLER

(PAUSE)

I have a terrible urge to port
into it What about you

PIKUL
(he thinks shes joking)
Oh sure Yes Desperate to port
into it
Geller steps over to a bunch of UmbyCords draped over a peg
and strips one off She sits down on a rotting wooden
folding chair next to the death-pods basket and ports in
one end of the UmbyCord

GELLER
Here we go Wanna give me a hand

PIKUL

(HORRIFIED)
Youre not serious I mean
thats a diseased pod Once you
port into that you become
you you

GELLER
(a quick smile)
Exactly Help me

Pikul kneels beside her as she pulls up her shirt to reveal
her bioport Geller hands him the free end of the UmbyCord
and he ports it into her

PIKUL
How long does it take for the
infection to take hold

GELLER
No time at all

PIKUL
And then you quietly port into
all the other pods and spread the
infection to them

GELLER
(pale shaky)
Oh God

PIKUL
Whats happening

GELLER

F (SWOONING)
Somethings wrong

PIKUL

(SUPPORTING HER)
Im gonna unport you now
Pikul tries to unport Geller but her bioport has swollen
and seized the jack He gives the UmbyCord a tug

GELLER
(in sudden pain)
0 God dont That really hurts
Pikul lets go The death-pod triggered off by Pikuls
attempt to disconnect Geller now begins to convulse in
peristaltic waves in its wicker basket Pikul looks around
desperately and spots a clutch of tools hanging from nails
on the wall
PIKUL

(RISING)

Im going to cut you free

GELLER

No dont Im afraid

But Pikul seizes a crude linoleum knife used for trimming
oversized motherboards and with three erratic slashes at
the quivering UmbyCord hacks her loose Blood immediately
pours out of both ends of the severed cord

GELLER C

(wide-eyed quietly)

Pikul

Im bleeding to death

Panic-stricken Pikul steps on Gellers end of the cord to
stop the bleeding It seems to work but Geller moans
horribly

m so

Pikul
standi

Nouris

Death
Nouris
Where

from t

PIKUL

(TERRIFIED)
rry I dont know what else

NOURISH
what to do
twists awkwardly around to see Yevgeny Nourish
ng just behind him He is in the process of slipping a
propane torch off its wall hook

NOURISH
exactly what to do
h unscrews the gas valve and ignites the torch

NOURISH

to Realism

h turns the blazing torch on the pod in the basket
the cone of flame hits the pod it begins to shrivel
e sputter fat The pod itself tries to ripple away
he searing flame as though it were alive Nourish

laughs and begins to play the cone over the entire surface
of the pod

Geller sinks to the ground in exhaustion holds on to
Pikuls leg

The death-pod now swells and bubbles under the torchs
flame then explodes with a dull whump

INT TROUT FARM ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY

A huge cloud speckled black and gray billows upwards and
floats out over the intersecting walls of the stalls and
into the main area of the Trout Farms assembly line where
it begins to settle like granular ash on the startled
workers

INT TROUT FARM ASSEMBLY BAYS - NIGHT

i Horrified Nourish watches the thick cloud of infectious
spores floating out of his reach

NOURISH

(HORRIFIED)
No no

S
Gathering up her last shreds of energy Geller suddenly
shoves a startled Pikul off her cord and picks up the
linoleum knife from where Pikul dropped it
Trailing her bloody cord she lunges at Nourishi driving the
rusty curved blade into his back with great force Nourish
turns to Geller the torch circling towards her wavering
He tries to touch her with the flame staggers

NOURISH
(DYING)
Death death to the demoness
Barb Brecken to the
PIKUL

Death to who
(he fingers his ID card)
Oh yeah Barb
Nourish drops the torch falls to the ground and snaps into
the foetal position A wall of flame roars up around him
fueled by the straw wood canvas pod-oils Pikul jumps
over to Geller and picks up the trailing cord twists it in
his hands until it stops bleeding

All four walls of the assembly bay are on fire now The
doorway is a flapping sheet of flame Mixing with the
swelling rush of the flame are the sounds of the entire
plant going on alert yells screams sirens running feet
doors being slammed open and closed

Pikul holds Geller tightly She is limp weak drained in
his arms

PIKUL
think we just lost the game
But now strange anomalous objects begin to appear out a
nowhere in the flames - a chair a tv set a bath tub a
table objects emerging into the game from the quest chalet
After a moments confusion Pikul smiles

PIKUL
Or maybe not
And sure enough the Trout Farm and its flames and its black
cloud melt away

R

IT

INT GUEST CHALET - NIGHT

As the guest chalet melts up around them Pikul finds
himself back on the bed as he expected but he is still
embracing the swooning Geller which he had not expected

PIKUL
Allegra were back home Whats
the matter whats wrong
As Geller swims back up into full consciousness she begins
to talk mumbling at first then with terrible clarity

GELLER

(BARELY COHERENT)
Pikul Its here its happened
Its come back here with us We
brought it back with us from
eXistenzZ

PIKUL
Brought what back I cant
understand what youre saying

GELLER

(WITH CLARITY)
We brought the disease back with
us My pod is diseased
As though realizing the implications of what shes saying
for the first time Geller twists away from Pikul and begins
to fumble with her UmbyJack

GELLER
Oh God Im really going to lose
it Im going to lose my game
Unport me Cmon unport me
Pikul unports her then begins to tug at his own jack When
he takes a close look at the pod he can see that it looks -
unhealthy
Geller jumps off the bed and yanks open her bag on the
table She pulls out a tiny hypodermic syringe unwraps it
flicks the bubbles out of it falls to her knees beside the
bed

GELLER

(LO POD)
Im coming Im coming
Geller jabs the pod with the needle As sne pushes in the
plunger she starts to massage it with her free hand rub
it prod it Shes so close to it we think she might give it
mouth-to-mouth

PIKUL
But this cant be possible How
can a game event emerge into real
life
GELLER

(PANICKING)
Theres a very weird reality-
bleed-through effect happening
here Im not sure I get it
Pikul finally gets his UmbyCord unplugged

PIKUL
Whats in that needle

GELLER
Its an anti-viral serum It
sometimes works if you get it in
time
Unconsciously Pikul scratches at his bioport Geller fixes
on him with strange intensity

GELLER
Lemme see your bioport

PIKUL
What

GELLER
Lemme see it
Pikul turns and shows it to her She begins to examine it
with microscopic clinical attention

GELLER
I know what happened Its
Vinokur that bastard

PIKUL
Vinokur

GELLER
He gave you a new bioport didnt
he

PIKUL

Oh no
GELLER
He gave you an infected bioport
so that my pod would die and so
would my game-system

PIKUL
Im infected Wait a minute

GELLER

(IN TEARS)
The poor thing was trying to tell
us that it was sick by
introducing the theme of disease
into our game

PIKUL
The theme of disease Im fucking
reall infected Is it going to
crawl up my spine and rot my
brain

GELLER
(suddenly all business)
All right dont panic Ive got
something that will help you
Brusquely wiping away her tears Geller goes over to her bag
and takes out a cork-shaped plastic capsule She snaps open
the capsule to reveal a knurled plug-like electronic
device

GELLER
Im going to seal up your bioport
with this anti-viral resonator
Geller bends over Pikul and works the device into his
bioport until its flush with his skin

GELLER
(inserting the device)
It uses the Umby pick-ups for
power Should cleanse all your
porting channels of infection in
a few hours Itll give you a
little skin buzz when its done
Of course we cant play until
then

PIKUL
(controlling his panic)
Yeah great Now listen This
could be critical Were you
really saying that Vinokur is an

(MORE )

9

PIKUL (CONTD)
agent of the Anti-
eXistenZialists Because if he
is if hes with them then we
are really

GELLER

(WAILING)
Oh God Pikul my pods dying
Sure enough the thing is quivering rippling convulsing
turning purple

GELLER

(WAILING)
I cant help it I cant do
anything for it
Geller falls to her knees beside the pod
As though triggered by this action an explosion in the
nearest chalet blows the windows and the door out of the
guest chalet Pikul and Geller are knocked to the floor by
the impact of the blast
Waves of heat and debris billow into the room
A moment of eery silence and then Pikul and Geller peek
wide-eyed over the-edge of the bed Flames now engulf the
nearby chalet all too clearly visible throught the
shattered window frames
Sounds of pandemonium begin to well up from the hills below
and then a figure steps boldly in through the doorway When
the flamelight flickers over his face Pikul and Geller are
stunned to see that it is the cashier and he is cradling a
real-life submachine gun in his arms
The cashier screams at the bewildered and terrified pair

CASHIER

(SCREAMS )
else

The uprising has begun The whole
place is on fire Lets go
Youve got to get out of here
Theyll be looking for you

PIKUL

(TO GELLER)
The cashier Hes a game
character How can he be here

AS

GELLER
I dont know I dont know
The cashier strides into the room and pulls her to her feet
She tries to pick up her pod but the cashier tugs her away
from it

CASHIER
Leave that rotting piece of meat
here Its done its job Let it
die

GELLER
But my game My games inside it
I dont want my game to die
The cashier unslings his submachine gun cocks it and blows
the pod into streaks of slime flesh and slivers of insect-
board Geller is in shock Pikul turns her to face him
speaks forcefully right into her face shuts everything

out

PIKUL
Allegra listen to me I think
were still inside the game I
think your real pods out there
somewhere somewhere safe I
think its OK to let go of this
one this pod Its not the real
one
A Molotov cocktail comes sailing into the room and shatters
against the bed The bed ignites with an explosive whump
CASHIER
Everybody out now
The three of them scramble out into the fiery night

EXT CALEDON SKI-CLUB COMPOUND - NIGHT

The cashier leads Pikul and Geller out of the guest chalet
and down the mountain path The chalet next to theirs begins
to implode as they scurry by it

As they flee they realize that all the chalets are on fire
There are people trying to fight the fires running

rx frantically everywhere with hand-held extinguishers There
is also scattered gunfire but whos firing on whom is
impossible to tell

EXT HILLTOP - NIGHT
The cashier now leads them up to the top of a hill

CASHIER
Up here We can see everything
from here

PIKUL
What is it that were seeing

CASHIER

(GLEEFUL)
The victory of Realism And you
were part of it

GELLER

(DESOLATE)
The death of eXistenZ And we
were part of it
The cashier turns on her with his gun He snaps out his old
clip and slams home a new one He cocks the gun

CASHIER
Theres just one more thing

PIKUL

(HORRIFIED)
What are you doing Were on your
side

CASHIER

(FIERCE)

How could you be How could
Allegra Geller the worlds
premiere game designer be on our
side

(off their bewildered

LOOKS )
Oh Y93 We know who you are You
cant hide inside a game forever

PIKUL
Somethings slipped over the
edge here Allegra Somethings
all wrong

CASHIER

(SMILES)
There You see what I mean You
see the problem

9
The cashier raises his gun to fire at Geller but before he
can pull the trigger he jolts backwards and falls twitching
to the ground

From the shadows of the trees backlit by the fiery
landscape below steps Kiri Vinokur In his hand he holds
the gristle gun which Pikul assembled in the Chinese
restaurant

VINOKUR
I tried to find you Thank God I
got here in time
(pause waggles the gun)
My dog brought me this

GELLER

(BACKING AWAY)
You didnt get here in time My
game is dead

(FOCUSSING)
You murdered my game

VINOKUR

(LAUGHS)
No just your pod I replicated
the entire contents of your pod
when I fixed your nerve boards
Theyre in safe-keeping Theyre
all in one piece

GELLER
You copied eXistenZ

VINOKUR

(soft pleading)

Allegra come over to Cortical
Systematics Yes yes Cortical
Systematics Im defecting and so
are all the Antenna Research top
brass Pellatt Melzack Sherrin
everybody good

GELLER
Youre a spy for Cortical
Systematics

PIKUL

(CONFUSED)
Wait a minute Cortical
Systematics is just the qame
version its only
I9
VINOKUR

TIGNORING PIKUL)
Not a spy exactly I think of
myself as a personnel exchange
engineer If you want to be
reunited with your creation
youll come over to us eXistenZ
by Allegra Geller Only from
Cortical Systematics

GELLER

(DEFIANT)
Only from Antenna Research

VINOKUR
But why stay with them Look at
that mess down there How could
you trust Antenna again when
theyve endangered you like this
Geller seems to have lost the thread She wanders over to
the cashiers body and disentangles his submachine gun from
him

GELLER
(referring to cashier)
You know this guy was actually
going to kill me
Vinokur looks to Pikul for support

VINOKUR

(TO PIKUL)
Can you talk to her I mean we
can take you with us too
But before Pikul can respond Geller now sitting next to
the cashiers body on the grass opens fire at Vinokur with
the submachine gun Vinokur falls with a startled expression
on his face
Pikul absolutely horrified runs at Geller and kicks the
weapon out of her hand picks it up himself

PIKUL
What the fuck are you doing
Youve killed him Are you gonna
kill me next
A-
GELLER

(LAUGHS GIDDILY)
Cmon Pikul Hes only a game
character And I didnt like the
way he was messing with my mind

PIKUL

(SUDDENLY CALM)
Didnt you You didnt like that
and so you killed him

GELLER
He was only a game character

PIKUL
(QUIETLY)

But Allegra What if were not in
the game anymore

GELLER
(confused childlike)
Huh If if we were not
PIKUL

(STRANGELY HARD)
If were not then you just
killed someone real A real
person

(PAUSE)
You see what can happen Its
important for me that you see
that

GELLER
Why

PIKUL
(standing over her)
It wasnt an accident that you
and I ended up on the run
together

GELLER
Not an accident
Pikul hefts the submachine gun in his hands

PIKUL
No

GELLER

(COLD)
Thats why you never had a
bioport You were one of them

PIKUL
I still am one of them

GELLER
But you have a bioport now

(IRONIC)
I thought that was forbidden to
Anti-eXistenZialists

PIKUL
I made the bioport sacrifice to
get close to you to make love to
my enemy

GELLER
Why would you do that

PIKUL
To understand what I have to
kill

GELLER
(QUIETLY)

Then understand this
Geller produces a tiny electronic remote controller from the
pocket of her shirt

GELLER
Understand that I suspected who
you were from the moment you made
that fake phone call to yourself
in the limo Understand that I
knew you were my real assassin
when you pointed the gun at me in
the Chinese restaurant
She flicks up a safety cover on the remotes tip revealing
a toggle switch Pikuls hands tense around the submachine
gun

GELLER
And understand that youre dead
Geller flips the toggle switch The base of Pikuls spine
blows out his shirt billowing with blood as his bioport
explodes

9
A delighted Geller dances to her feet as Pikul staggers
backwards

GELLER

(GLEEFUL)
Death to the demon Ted Pikul
His eyes frozen in a death stare Pikul falls rolls down
the hill into the underbrush Smoke creeping up from the
fires below curls over him like a blanket
Arms raised in the air Geller dances around on the top of
the hill looking down on the flames and the chaos

GELLER
(confident laughing)
Have I won the game Have I won
Have I won
The hill the trees the flames melt down around her

INT COUNTRY CHURCH - NIGHT

We melt back up into the church which we last saw in the
first scene But there are many differences between then and
now

Geller is sitting in her chair on the dais as before her
eyes just beginning to flutter open But Pikul is sitting
next to her also playing the game And next to him is
Nourish whom we are even more surprised to see in this
context

Aad in fact the players who are sitting in the circle of
chairs on the dais are all characters who have been in the
movie up to this point Nader the cashier Dichter Gas
Vinkokur even Frances the limo driver

The players are all emerging from a game that has just ended
- the movie we have been watching - and they begin to stir
in their game gear which is nothing like the organic pod-
technology we have just seen

On the contrary the garners are wearing head-gear with
electrodes more like normal clunky Virtual-Reality
equipment and are linked by mundane wires In their laps
they hold not game-pods but sleek plastic game modules
each about the size of a walkman with holes into Which

I their left thumbs are inserted - a simpler and cruder
version of the bioports we have become used to

Watching the proceedings from down on the church floor are
two security guards neither of whom is Pikul of course On
a leash one of the security guards holds the dog that in
the game picked up the gristle gun in the Chinese
restaurant

Also monitoring the action are a woman Merle who is the
games actual project manager - the real-life version of the
game-character Levi - and her two assistants

There is a collective sigh as the game finally releases the
players and now they are free to remove their thumbs from
the game modules and slide their head-gear off

The two assistants - the real-life ones are both matronly
women - begin to help everyone unplug neatly gathering up
the equipment in padded bags as they go

A broadly smiling Merle mounts the dais and stands in the
centre of the ring of players

MERLE
Are you all back
The man whom we knew in the game as Yevgeny Nourish
immediately stands and takes charge But it is a different
Nourish exuberant sensitive and artistic
NOURISH
Were back Merle Although I
have a feeling some of our crew
might not realize it yet
Shaky laughter from some of the players

Throughout the following round of comments from the garners
whom we now realize have been up to now playing characters
in a game we hear nothing from Pikul and Geller These two

who sit next to each other and are now holding hands
enigmatically silent

WAITER
Wow Anybody here want a bowl of
hot and sour soup

(LAUGHTER)

VINOKUR
I will if you make sure there

R
are some insect boards in the

F(
rice

(LAUGHTER)

FEMALE ASSISTANT
How long were we gone

MERLE
About twenty minutes

T
DICHTER
It seemed like days Thats

fantastic

FEMALE ASSISTANT
Yeah If you stayed in the
gameworld for most of your life

remain
you could live to be five hundred
years old

(LAUGHTER)

CASHIER
The twists and turns at the end
made my head spin Maybe there
were too many to fast to absorb
(to Pikul and Geller)
Hey but you two were fantastic
You guys are game divas I think
you both deserved to win
There is general agreement amongst the garners about this
compliment to Pikul and Geller The pair just smile sweetly
and bob their heads modestly at the smattering of applause

GAS
(a little jealous)
Well me I was really bummed out
at first I got knocked out of
the game so soon It was fun to
watch the rest though I liked
that part where the ones who got
knocked out of the game early got
to be spooky customers in the
game store

LEVI
But you were so wonderfully bad
So scary and crazy I had a lot
to do in that first scene in the
church but I thought my character
was kind of boring

GAS
Well you know Im a gas-jockey
in real life so I was kind of
disappointed that I was basically
the same thing in the game A
little more fantasy there
fellers

Y
MERLE

(NODDING SAGELY)
Interesting Interesting Hold
that thought for the focus group

FRANCES
(indicating game module)
Can I keep this Ive never felt
anything like it And I love this
little thumb-hole Its
fantastic
(appreciative laughs and

APPLAUSE)
NOURISH

(LAUGHS)
Nice try but youre going to
have to turn them in because
theyre beta versions pre-
production hand-made specials
and we need to study them after
use for wear and tear and other
things But youll get a
certificate for helping us out
here - Im right about that
arent I Merle

MERLE

(NODDING ENTHUSIASTICALLY)
And that will entitle you to
reserve one of the first batch of
the TranscendenZ by Pilgrimage
game modules to hit the market
and at a seriously discounted
price Youre gonna love it
Amidst applause and general excitement Merle turns to the
tripod-mounted chalkboard standing as in the first scene
at the back of the dais There we see the words that she has
already written TranscendenZ by Pilgrimage

MERLE
Remember - its written like
this Capital T capital Z
TranscendenZ Its new its from
Pilgrimage - capital P capital
I and its coming soon

Allegra Geller now stands up walks over to Nourish an
gently takes his hand He turns to see whos got him
smiles broadly

GELLER

(SHYLY)
Id just like to say thank you to
Mr Nourish for giving me the
chance to play the role of a star
designer I guess the game picked
up on my ambitions to be like
you

NOURISH
well let me first say that Im
kinda glad I lost this game I
dont usually play such nasty
characters

(LAUGHTER)
And Allegra you were so good in
that role that I suspect it wont
be long before Pilgrimage is
after you to sign a designing
contract
(applause and laughter)
And maybe you should take your
friend Ted here Mr Pikul with
you Hes obviously good ina
crisis and when you design
games there are plenty of them

Amid the renewed good-natured laughter Geller blushes

reaches out for Pikuls hand

GELLER
I guess you all could tell that
Ted and I had a relationship
prior to our coming here We
really do like to play together

d
then

She
PIKUL
(shy but determined)
We do but Id like to assure
everybody here that Allegra
wouldnt really jump into bed
with a security guard unless he
was me
(laughs from the security

GUARDS)
Merle holds out her hand in a gesture of appreciation
towards Nourish

MERLE
Well what do we say to our
brilliant award-winning game
designer Yevgeny Nourish Does
he have another winner on his
hands or not

PC
Wild applause from all garners including Geller and Pikul

MERLE
All right now I have to ask you
some questions before the game
half-life wears off First let
me thank you for taking part in
this test seminar Pilgrimage
wants to deliver nothing but the
finest to the game enthusiast
and you have all been a proud
part of that process tonight
When weve collected all the
head-sets and game modules well
be handing out a questionnaire to
each of you and Id like your
answers to the questions to be as
honest as brutal as clear as
you can make them Dont hold
back After that were going to
form a focus group where well
discuss details of each of your
experiences playing TranscendenZ
Youve all had different but
interlocking lives in the game
and I think youll be amazed when
you hear each others stories

INT COUNTRY CHURCH MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

While the questionnaires are being handed out by the
assistants Nourish confers with Merle in a corner

NOURISH

(INTENSE)
Merle I was very disturbed by
the game we just played

MERLE
What do you mean

NOURISH
It had a very strong very real
anti-game theme I mean it began
with the assassination of a game
designer

MERLE
or Really But thats very creative

(PAUSE)
But on second thought I see what
you mean It makes me nervous
You think it must have come from
one of our game players

NOURISH
It sure didnt come from me The
tone of it in the game was very
very passionate fanatical And
the atmosphere of paranoia and
betrayal was overwhelming The
whole thing felt unstable
dangerous volatile But worse
than that there was a kind of
industrial espionage subplot
Stealing game-systems jumping

ship from one game company to

another That kind of thing

They both reflexively begin to scan the gaming group who
are all innocently dealing with their question cards

MERLE
So which one of them did these
elements come from

NOURISH
Lets probe it when we do the
focus group I think we might
have been infiltrated here and
if we have weve got a big
security problem
Pikul andGeller questionnaires in hand wander over to the
wary Nourish and Merle Pikul is now leading the dog that
the security guard was holding for him earlier on the model
for the game dog in the Chinese restaurant

PIKUL
Hi We were just wondering if we
could ask Mr Nourish a question
away from all the others

NOURISH
Sure Shoot

(CHUCKLES)
Long as you dont ask me to fill
in your questionnaire

PIKUL

(NO CHUCKLES)
Weve played your game now and
so we can finally agree with the
others that you are the worlds
greatest game artist

(OMINOUSLY)
We werent sure before
9
NOURISH
(PROFESSIONALLY MODEST

SMILE)
Well thank you so much

I
GELLER

(NO SMILE)
Yevgeny dont you think you
should suffer for all the harm
youve done and intend to do to
the human race

NOURISH

(STUNNED )
What

PIKUL
Yes Dont you think the worlds
greatest game artist ought to be
punished for the most effective
deforming of reality

MERLE

(NERVOUSLY)
I dont think this is very
(looks towards security

GUARDS)
Boys Could you come over here -
right now
But its too late Geller reaches down and pulls a flap of
false fur and skin away from the dog to reveal two semi-
automatic pistols strapped to the dogs flank Pikul and
Geller grab the guns pull back the slides and cooly
execute Merle and Nourish who bump grotesquely together as
they slump to the ground
In the stunned silence that follows only the clatter of the
last few shells bouncing around on the hardwood floor can be
heard Pikul and Geller glance at each other pumped then
fill the silence

GELLER
(SCREAMS )
Death to the demon Yevgeny

Nourish

PIKUL

(SCREAMS )
Death to PilgrImage Death to
TranscendenZ

Now a hesitant shuffling of feet causes Pikul and Geller to
whirl and catch the security guards coming at them with
their pathetic scanning wands The guards stop in their
tracks raise their hands and start to back away as the
place suddenly explodes in screams and pandemonium

As Pikul and Geller in their turn back towards the front
exit they glide past the young Chinese man who was the
waiter in the game The waiter stands flattened out in fear
against a pillar with his questionnaire and his pencil in
his hand
They ignore the waiter but stop to wait for Pikuls dog to
trot calmly past them heading for the door
