Others look on or look away with indifference as they are
loaded onto waiting trucks

Where Tuvia and Zus are concealed From within the car we
hear VOICES SPEAKING GERMAN A YOUNG PRIVATE gets out and
walks up the road to investigate

From the car an SERGEANT yells a reply

out of the car and lights a cigarette

Hes followed by the Sergeant He carries a Schmeisser
SUBMACHINE GUN dangling from his shoulder

on an occasional tree for support He finds the erstwhile
sentry --LAZAR -- ambling toward him

Zus punches him knocking him the ground In a sloppy
drunken frenzy Zus SLAPS him again

speaks it is awkward ineffectual amid the growing tumult

we made will not be made again

with tears in their eyes This is what they need --
leadership faith something to believe in

And gradually his tentativeness and awkwardness is
by something else A new voice From deep inside

TUVIA (CONTD)

We will map out where weve been
so as to not visit the same farms
too often And we take only from
those who can afford to give and
leave those who cant alone

LOVA

The poorest farmer has more than

us

TUVIA

True But what I am saying is

what I mean is We are not thieves

(his resolve growing

with every word)

Or murderers We may be hunted

like animals but we will not become
animals

(looks at them all)

We have all chosen this -- to live
free like human beings for as
long as we can Each day of freedom
is an act of faith And if we die
trying to live at least we die

Suddenly the dog LEAPS at her She turns away and it rips
a sack from her shoulder knocking her down Viciously it
begins tearing the sack apart in search of the food within

Justice

Soon it is a chant Justice Justice Tuvia looks at

We SEE now that she is holding a sharpened hoe

BELLA (CONTD)
He was fifteen He had blue eyes
She raises it above her head

BELLA (CONTD)

He played the piano

She swings with all her might The others watch with a mix
of thrilled horror and perverse delight A line has been
crossed Riva steps forward holding a large shovel

RIVA

My sisters name was Ellie

As she swings the shovel the CAMERA begins to back away
Miriam steps forward carrying a large rock

Tuvia closes his eyes He has done nothing to stop it
Asael looks at Malbin and Shimon They are undone by what
they have witnessed Tuvia walks away

Behind them the group separates -- staring at the lifeless
body on the ground And then they look at each other their
blood lust sated beginning to reckon with what they have
done What they have become

138 TUVIA STANDS ALONE IN THE FOREST HIS FACE IN SHADOW 138
He sees Aron squatting beside a tree crying silently
Tuvia kneels beside him cradling him

TUVIA

Reeboynoy shel oylum Lord of the

Universe We have done unspeakable

things yet still I seek your mercy

He HEARS something Malbin waits at the edge of the forest
His face is drawn and pale from what has just happened

ZUS

ASAEL

Whered you get the jacket

ZUS

Lets just say the former owner no

Zus winks The other bodyguards stare impassively

ZUS (CONTD)
Embrace me
Asael looks confused for a moment then embraces him

ZUS (CONTD)

(WHISPERING)

Hide this

(shoves a revolver

into his pocket)

Wolnicky stores ammunition for us

He slaps Asael fondly on the cheek and rejoins his comrades

Viktor rejoins his bodyguards turns back for a last word

Youre deliberately sacrificing

VIKTOR

No So we can keep fighting
Everyone must sacrifice in the
struggle

ZUS
Those are my brothers
VIKTOR

I am your brother He is your

sentimentality is heart-warming

but counter-revolutionary

Zus has secretly known he would hear these words He grips
his rifle but holds his tongue

BACK TO

142 THE SPOTTER PLANE -- FLIES OVER THE BIELSKI CAMP 142
Tuvia stares up at it Have they been spotted

Shimon is sitting nearby with a group of children He looks
pale His cough is worse He is very ill

SHIMON

but the children of Israel were
afraid to leave Egypt Until Moses
said Do not trust in me trust in
God He will take care of you

(a wrenching cough)

And so tomorrow we celebrate the
Passover by sitting around and
arguing just as we have done for
centuries

Tuvia stares at them a curious expression on his face
Malbin comes to stand beside him

We leave now Spread the word

143 MOMENTS LATER - THE BIELSKI CAMP 143

is a blur of activity as everyone mobilizes for evacuation
Sacks and cooking equipment is tied onto impromptu packs
Asael and Malbin coax the older people into motion--

ASAEL
Come tateh--

OPPENHEIM

But my tools--

The SOUND of approaching aircraft Tuvia searches the sky
Riva pairs each of the elderly with a child Tamara tucks
her newborn under her coat

where people crowd in like sardines Chaya and Riva gather
children around them They hear the WHISTLE of an incoming
shellBOOM Dirt from the roof rains down on them

146 BOMBS BEGIN TO RAIN DOWN 146

Dirt and debris everywhere AN INCENDIARY SHELL HITS high
in a tree Its branches burst into flame

An hysterical woman leaps out of a bunker and is BLOWN

147 MEANWHILE - IN VIKTORS CAMP 147
Zus listens helplessly to the distant sound of bombs

on his brothers
148 BACK IN THE BIELSKI CAMP - A DIRECT HIT ON A ZEMYLANKA

It explodes into a million pieces Wood shrapnel everywhere
Where once was a bunker now there is only a gaping crater
Tuvia races into the maelstrom to help the wounded

AN EXPLOSION KNOCKS HIM DOWN
He tries to clear his head but he cannot focus ALL SOUND
FADES AWAY to be replaced by a high-pitched hum

Falling dirt and debris tumbling bodies exploding bunkers

machine gun behind a log Lazar Miriam and Rosa in the
trees

Tuvia anxiously waits for the last of the women and children
to disappear into the forest

A SUDDEN SILENCE DESCENDS - EVERYONE LOOKS TO THE SKY
Tuvia realizes the bombers have broken off their attack
He knows the ground troops will soon follow

He turns to Asael grabbing his shoulders

TUVIA

Dont try to fight Just slow

them down Then join us

Asael nods No need for more words They embrace fiercely
Asael pushes Chaya toward Tuvia

check their weapons with grim efficiency They are no longer
inept innocents they have become warriors

Asael fires blindly into the murky shadows The SOUND of a

Then Levine is hit Miriam pushes him out of the way and
TAKES OVER She expertly kills several assault troops who
appear out of the woods

The rest of the attackers TAKE COVER

his panic)

Lazar runs from tree to tree keeping up a steady stream of
fire He is surprisingly brave Until A GRENADE flies out
of the woods and lands at his feet killing him instantly
The Assault Troops have begun to outflank them Asael is
suddenly in jeopardy Sara sees the danger

MIRIAM

Go

Miriam keeps their ATTACKERS pinned down as the two men
race for new positions Then she is hit She keeps firing
anyway her finger locked on the trigger even as she is
dying

More troops begin firing from their flank Asael has no
choice but to break off They race into the woods

THE TANK ROARS FIRE The first round EXPLODES among them
Several are killed

Back to the river

He pushes people down They cling to the banks cowering
THOSE WITH WEAPONS take cover using the embankment as if
it were the lip of a trench

They RETURN FIRE -- old men young women even some

172 A SQUAD OF GERMAN INFANTRY ADVANCES 172

behind the tank using it as protection

Aron kills one But the Germans are well-trained They
direct a withering fire -- forcing the partisans to keep
their heads below the embankment

BUT THE TANK IS UNSTOPPABLE

It turns its attentions on the riverbank -- its first round
SAILS OVERHEAD sending up a huge geyser of water

But the next round PLOWS INTO THE EARTH tearing a huge
chunk of earth and killing two of the brigade

TUVIA grabs a satchel and begins filling it with grenades
He throws the satchel over Malbins head grabs his arm and
races crouching low beneath the lip of the riverbank
Asael provides covering fire So do Lilka Chaya and the
women alongside the men

UP AHEAD

A stand of trees hides Tuvia from view as he climbs out of
the river and heads into the forest He pulls Malbin down
just as A SQUAD OF GERMAN INFANTRY approaches and begins to
set up a heavy machine gun

gun He then turns the heavy machine gun on the infantry

German

advancing behind the tank -- to devastating effect

But now the tank turns its attention to Tuvia Its machine
gun begins to chew up the forest forcing Tuvia to take
cover

Without pausing to think Malbin grabs a grenade from the
satchel and races toward the tank

It falls pitifully short exploding harmlessly as Malbin is
cut down

WHEN SUDDENLY FROM OUT OF THE WOODS

Zus and the rest of Jewish fighters emerge firing on the
run Without regard for his own life Zus charges

The German infantry is caught in a cross-fire as the Bielski
brigade climbs out the river firing wildly

Zus guns down the tank commander manning the machine gun
from the open hatch Jumps onto the tank and DROPS A GRENADE
inside An EXPLOSION of BLACK SMOKE BILLOWS

Zus stands up amid the billowing smoke He sees Tuvia who

is staring back at him
