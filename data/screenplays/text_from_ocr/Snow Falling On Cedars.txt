a face Strong and blond and handsome

two large BATTERIES in place PAN to

the deck of this sturdy stern-picker The fishing net
stretched

from the huge DRUM into the sea Keep PANNING to the bow

Carl stands with his kerosene lantern and his air horn

ART

MORAN is painfully thin unimposing methodical Only the eyes

reflect his disquiet His young deputy ABEL MARTINSON cuts

anxious looks between his mentor and the sea As the net brings

silvered salmon across the gunnel CUT to

the cabin Tidy as before Only two things have changed
CLOSE on the tin coffee cup which now lies OVERTURNED on the
floor PAN above the open battery well where a third MARINE
BATTERY now stands next to the wheel CUT to

the stern as the raveling net LIFTS from the waters

revealing Carls face As CREDITS CONTINUE tilt up to the
coroner HORACE WHALEY gazing down A shading of regret behind
the professional mask A series of QUICK CUTS
-Whaleys hand pulls the SHUTTLE of TWINE from Carls pocket
examines the open empty KNIFE SHEATH at Carls belt
Carls wrist its WATCH stopped at 147
Whaley bends over Carls body presses on his solar plexus
watching pink FOAM rise from Carls mouth and nose And then
He sees something more His fingers gently pull back the hair
from above Carls left ear to reveal

-a skull wound The bone caved in Four inches across
EXT SAN PIEDRO ISLAND - DAY
Snow falling on cedars
SUPERIMPOSE DECEMBER 6
The heavens descend softly onto our island Exquisite silent
hypnotic An epic snowfall inspiring awe at our frailness

against
the limitless scope of nature As CREDITS CONCLUDE a series of
QUICK ANGLES

Cars pirouetting skating on their tires past an abandoned
school bus where kids throw snowballs at is windows

Fisks Hardware Center its endless queue of orderly citizens
waiting stoically for their snow shovels and kerosene

the harbor with its moored fleet of tiny fishing vessels

blanketed as if by volcanic ash a pair of teenage lovers
building

a snowman at the edge of a dock she pushes the boy into the
water

and he rises laughing steam rising from his clothes

-undulating strawberry fields of pure white untouched and
flawless as the Sahara

Finally to a public building cars gathering as best they can
people streaming up snow-laden steps to the entrance and as we
FOLLOW them SMASH CUT to

INT COURTROOM - DAY

CLOSE on impassive EYES They are Asian We have seen them
before PULL BACK to see

KABUO MIYAMOTO Early 30s dark blue suit clean shirt He
sits

ramrod straight utterly motionless expressionless the eye of a

storm of movement in

the assembling COURTROOM A packed gallery of buzzing locals
the scent of anticipation A bank of REPORTERS and

PHOTOGRAPHERS
cosmopolitan in attire bearing themselves as jaded dignitaries
from the civilized world As we PAN their ranks

ISHMAEL (VO)
It was the first murder trial on
the island in thirty-one years

we look over the right shoulder of ISHMAEL CHAMBERS early
30s

dark a rugged somber man jotting notes on a pad which rests on

his right leg

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Our only newspaper was the San
Piedro Review a four-page weekly
that I operated alone
He glances blandly at his nonchalant colleagues

ISHMAEL (V0O)
What I wondered could the Seattle
boys know of the hearts of these
people

To the JURY BOX Truck farmers grocers fishermen in sober
neckties A waitress a secretary fisher wives in Sunday
dresses

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Neighbors sitting in judgement
On their neighbor

To the neighbor The ramrod-still defendant

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Kabuo Miaymoto sat with the rigid
grace of a Samurai warrior As if
detached from his own trial

Ishmael writing on the pad balanced precariously on his knee
until

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Did he know how dangerous his demeanor
could be With this jury

it falls with a CLATTER of pages He reaches with his right

hand replaces the pad on his thigh Around him CAMERAS are
being

swung to the ready Ishmael looks to see

a Slender WOMAN of refined beauty entering the courtroom

A few flashes POP and Ishmaels right hand retrieves a venerable
box camera from beneath his seat as his notepad falls once more
unheeded

ISHMAEL (VO)
Hatsue Miyamoto had been without
her husband for 77 days

Ishmael pivots and we understand his struggle with the notepad
For he is forced to rest his camera on the stump of his amputated
left arm its empty sleeve pinned at the elbow

ISHMAEL (V0O)
He was in jail When his baby son
learned to walk

Through his VIEWFINDER we see HATSUE take her place in the first
he

his

BACK

door

as

row And sensing her presence her husband turns Their eyes
meet A string of FLASHES

But none from Ishmael He hesitates As if considering whether
will violate this womans privacy The camera lowers HOLD on
face

INT COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

MATCH CUT to Hatsues face Staring impassive empty PULL

to see that she sits alone on a wooden bench by the courtroom
Her hands rest delicately on the purse in her lap Her demeanor
removed from this place as is her husbands

ISHMAEL (VO)
Earlier I noticed her in the
corridor

PULL BACK to see him alone in shadow It is more than a notice
Ishmael stares with fixed intensity at the motionless woman as
she gathers her thoughts A moment of decision He approaches
Stops respectfully at a distance which will not invade her
personal space And softer than we might have imagined

ISHMAEL
Are you all right

She turns her head only slightly It is enough Her voice quiet
and firm at once

HATSUE
Go away Ishmael

There is no anger Only directness and resolve

ISHMAEL
Please dont be like th

HATSUE (softer)
Go away

INT COURTROOM - DAY

PAN the back of the courtroom Twenty-four citizens of Japanese
ancestry fill the last row dressed in their most formal clothes
Shades of Atticus Finch As one the Japanese-Americans watch
the prosecutor ALVIN HOOKS a crisp even dapper man There
is

a quickness about the eyes a tendency to sharpness of manner
that

he works carefully against

HOOKS
four inch gash skull crushed
and your thought was what

JUDGE FIELDING tall and gray and rawboned leans on his elbows
his eyelids droop slightly a deceptive masking of keen
attention

HOOKS (0S)
That hefell Hit his head on
the gunnel going over

The witness is Sheriff Moran He answers as if this were a
sincere
question As if he had never heard it before

MORAN
Well Carl was six-four went 235
He was a grizzly bear and an able
seaman

Ishmael watching Thinking on that

MORAN (0S)
For him to justgo over Crush
his skull like that on the way in

HOLD on Ishmael
INT TEAM BUS - DAY

Teenage BOYS in football uniforms They ride with their helmets
in
their laps

ISHMAEL (V0O)
He was a mountain all right
Anchored the line for us little
fellers

CLOSE on Carl and Ishmael at 18 riding together Ishmael dark

and rugged even then is scarcely little But dwarfed by the
blond

giant at his side who glares out the window at

CARL
Chambers Ysee the geese

snow geese landing in low flooded wheat The grace of it
holds
both boys

CARL
Pictured be nice In your pas
paper

Ishmael nods absently They stare side-by-side

ISHMAEL
Lucky I got the camera in my
helmet

They never look at each other They never smile But you can
almost hear one in

CARL
Careful Chambers That was almost
a joke

INT COURTROOM - DAY

Hooks now stands with his polished shoe up on the witness podium
Like chatting with the Sheriff across the back fence

HOOKS
And you werent there when the
coroner examined the wound

MORAN
Nossir Id gone to tell the wid
to tell Mrs Heine

And his glance inevitably goes to the first row behind the
prosecutors table Taking the glances of the jury with it
SUSAN MARIE HEINE is pretty and blonde and full-bodied in her
modest black dress Composure and dignity Against her grief

EXT HEINE HOME - DAY

Moran climbs from his vehicle as Carls young SONS dash around
the

corner of the house Seeing the Sheriff they stop cold
Silent

shirtless barefoot

MORAN
Hey there men Is your mother
home a-tall
He spits his Juicy Fruit into a wrapper And as the younger boy
nods across the distance

SUSAN MARIE (0S)
Sheriff Moran hullo

She has appeared in the doorway smiling spittle-marked babys
diaper across her shoulder And he smiles back Tells the
boys

MORAN
You go on and play now

But they dont So he follows into her entryway closing the
door
behind him And at the foot of her curving staircase

SUSAN MARIE
What can I do for you Sheriff
Carls not home y

MORAN
Thats

Too quick He stops himself And she sees that

MORAN
Its why Im here Im afraid I
have somevery bad news to tell
you theworstkind of news

She looks at him uncomprehending the smile only beginning to
fade before

MORAN
Carl died last night Ina fishing
accident In White Sand Bay

She only blinks As if translating the words from a foreign
language

SUSAN MARIE
No Carls fine h

MORAN
We found him Mrs Heine Tangled
in his net

And with these words a slack blank look crosses her face and
she
stumbles back one step sitting down HARD on the bottom stair of
and

Her

his

him

her curved staircase

He doesnt know what to do She digs her elbows into her lap

begins to rock very slowly wringing the diaper in her hands
face is more terrible than tears It is frightened She murmurs
to herself so that we can barely hear
SUSAN MARIE
I told him this could happen
INT COURTROOM - DAY
CLOSE on Hooks nodding As if slowly digesting something in
mind
HOOKS
So noimmediate suspicion

nogeneral talk of enmity
between the two

MORAN
These are fishermen Alvin They
dont talk at all to each other
and less to me Specially gossip

EXT DOCKS - DAY

Ishmael walking down the sunlit wharf Purpose in his stride

ISHMAEL (V0O)
A gill-netter works through black
nights with only himself to talk
to And learns to be silent
They were lonely men and products
of geography

Up ahead the Susan Marie has been brought to dock Moran stands
chatting with a knot of six or seven FISHERMEN

ISHMAEL (VO)
men who on occasion realized
that they wished to speak but
couldnt
As he arrives Moran smiles a thin greeting Not happy to see

Of course neither is anyone else

MORAN
Figure youda heard by now
Ishmael shakes his head in silent helplessness WILLIAM GJOVAAG

sunburned big-bellied tattooed gill-netter clamps on his damp
cigar butt

GJOVAAG
You go fishing it happens

ISHMAEL (to Moran)
You see Susan Marie

MORAN
I did Boy

ISHMAEL
Three kids Whats she going to do

GJOVAAG (disgusted)
Well what can she do Jesus Christ

ISHMAEL
Excuse me Gjovaag

GJOVAAG
I dont need to excuse nothin
Fuck you anyhow Chambers

Everybody laughs It is all good-natured sort of

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Like the Sheriff I did not work
the sea and could never merit trust
Or respect

MARTY JOHANSSON
Sheriffs been askin which boats
followed Carl out last night

MORAN (quickly)
Only to see if somebody talked to
him out th

ISHMAEL
So who talked to him Out there

Staring At each other Eye contact holds during
JAN SORENSEN (heavy Danish)

So far we figured the guys who went
to Ship Channel Bank was Jim Ferry
Hardwell Moulton Miyamoto

GJOVAAG (spits)

Japs

MORAN
All right look if you see these
boys

GJOVAAG

Never saw you so hard-ass Art
Aint this just an accident

Moran finds his eyes drifting to Ishmaels Which are right
there
waiting Moran looks away

MORAN
Course it is but a mans dead
William I got to write my report

ANGLEIshmael and Moran walking alone back up the wharf The
Sheriff is worried Finally

MORAN
Im not gonna see some article
about an investigation am I

ISHMAEL (quietly)
You want me to lie

MORAN
No I wanna be off the damn record
thats what I want

No answer They keep walking

MORAN
I mean if there is a killer why
would you want him all alerted

Silence Silence And slowly
ISHMAEL
Lets saysomeday I need some
cooperation from you on this thing
Do I get it
And looks over Like the guy holding all the aces

INT COURTROOM - DAY
Moran fidgets on the stand

NELS (0S)
No sign of a struggle you say

SEE him now NELS GUDMUNDSSON attorney for Kabuo Miyamoto
stands

beside his impassive client Nels is 79 blind in his left eye
a

little shaky His body is winding down

MORAN
Well the coffee cup was layin right
in the middle of the floor like I
said And with a fella so neat as
Carl that did seem peculiar

And Nels begins to walk toward him Limping as he comes

NELS
As peculiar as a struggle between
a 235 pound man and an assailant
strong enough to subdue himthat
leaves only a single overturned cup
in its wake

HOOKS (0S)
Objection asking the witness to
speculate

NELS
My gosh Alvin was I supposed to
object every time you did that

A real Friendly smile

JUDGE (wearily)
Thats quite enough horseplay
Nels why dont you act your age

NELS
If I did that Your Honor Id
be dead

Some gentle laughter Judge Fielding doesnt even bother to look
annoyed

JUDGE
Any more homely loveable tricks
and youll be worse than that
Proceed gentlemen
HOOKS
Theres an objection Your H

JUDGE
And its overruled answer the
question If you can recall it

MORAN
Maybe the assailant straightened
the cabin And forgot the cup

NELS
Right In the middle Of the floor

MORAN
Maybe

Nels nods to himself as if considering that So that the jury
will do the same

NELS
I think you testified all the
lights were on Cabin mast
net lights picking lights

MORAN
Yessir thered been real heavy fog

NELS
And yet you started the engine
right up With all those lights
drawing all night the batteries
had that much charge Did that
strike you odd

MORAN
Didnt think about it at the time
So no it didnt strike me odd

NELS
Does it now

MORAN
A little Yes You have to
wonder

NELS

You have to wonder

And lets that sit Scratches his neck

NELS
You found three batteries you

say A D-6 and D-8 in the well
And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor
Correct

MORAN
It is

NELS
Now I did some measuring down at
the chandlery A D-6 is one inch
wider than a D-8 It would be too
large for the deceaseds well

MORAN
Hes done some on-the-spot refit-
ting You could see the side flange
was banged away to make room for
the D-6

NELS
But he had a spare D-6 you said
Right there Why not use that

MORAN
It was dead We had it tested
Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he
had to use it

Ah

NELS
Maybe he carried a spare that
was too large to fit So hed
have to bang out the flange to
squeeze it in

No answer to that The silence rests

NELS
Sheriff how many batteries and
what size did you find on defendants
boat

MORAN
Two D-6s Thats the kind his
well was fitted for

NELS
No spare

MORAN
No

NELS
So the defendant went out fishing
for the night with no spare battery
hmmn

MORAN
Apparently

NELS
Im curious The D-6 that was
refitted into the deceaseds well
Was it exactly the same brand and
model as defendants

A beat

MORAN
I believe so

NELS
Now youve testified that the
deceased was a heavy man and hard
to bring out of the net

Stops Thinking

NELS
Is it possible his head struck the
transom or the stern gunnel or the
net roller as you were bringing him
in

MORAN
I dont think so

NELS
You dont Think so

MORAN
He was heavy but we were real
careful But I dont remember him
hitting anything anywhere

NELS
You dont Remember

And clears his throat

NELS
Operating this winch youd rarely
operated before doing this awkward
job of bringing in a drowned man of
235 poundsis it possible Possible
that he struck his head after death
Possible

MORAN
Possible But not darn likely

NELS (turns to jury)
No further questions

And limps back to the defendants table Where Kabuo Miyamoto
sits
watching him

INT COURTROOM - LATER

Horace Whaley the county coroner folds his stork-like limbs
uncomfortably Searching for the appearance of ease

HOOKS
Sso when the sheriff returned
you showed him the injury to the
deceaseds head

WHALEY
He said Could it be somebody hit
him And I said You want to play
Sherlock Holmes here

Shakes his head with a wry disgusted smile

HOOKS
Did you say more

WHALEY
I said that if I was playing Sherlock
HolmesId maybe look for a
Japanese person With a bloody gun-
butt A right-handed fella to be
precise

HOOKS
And why Is that

Slight shrug

WHALEY
Well I was a doctor in the Jap
theater in the war I saw those
kendo wounds many times Looked
exactly like this one

HOOKS
Could you tell me what kendo is

WHALEY
Japanese stick-fighting Theyre
trained as kids yknow To kill
with sticks

And the prosecutors eyes drift to the defendant So that the
jurys will do the same HOLD on Kabuos regal bearing His
neutral mask

HOOKS (0S)
No further questions

EXT STRAWBERRY FIELDS - DAWN

Mist of early light Two dark figures little more than

silhouettes measuring each other with their lethal bokken
staffs

We may think of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader for one is a
full-

grown man The other eight years old Dialogue plays in

subtitled JAPANESE

ZENHICHI
Hips stomach cut Stomach muscles
tighten as stroke advances

And STRIKES a fearsome blow which the child REPELS with
startling

proficiency We can see ZENHICHIs stony face now If he is

impressed by his son he does not show it

CRASH The father has sent a blow in mid-word FLINGING the
child
like a doll The boy BOUNCES up snatching his bokken into ready
position

ZENHICHI (very quiet)
Zenshin Is constant awareness
Of dang

WHAP The child has unleashed a blow at the left side of his

fathers HEAD It has been blocked The staffs rest against
each

other just above Zenhichis ear There is no anger in either

warrior That we can see

ZENHICHI
Elbow soft A little better

LATERfather and son sit on the ground eating a small meal
The sun has risen angling light across the undulating fields
They are alone in beauty A long silence Dialogue in subtitled
JAPANESE

ZENHICHI
You can be good with the bokken
If you begin to concentrate

Eyes on his food As if alone as if speaking to himself The
boy
darting glances unseen at his fathers profile

ZENHICHI
You must choose now Kabuo At eight
years If you want this

KABUO (boldly)
I want it

The father keeps eating Never turns

ZENHICHI
Then speak quietly So you may be
heard

INT COURTROOM - MORNING

Whaley stares down the end of his needle-nose The air of
disdain
of a man playing chess with an unworthy opponent

NELS (0S)
So thisfoam you found in the
lungs How does it get there

WHALEY
As I testified It occurs when
water mucus and air are mixed by
respiration I believe I said that

NELS (slightly confused)
But a drowned person cant breathe

WHALEY
Of course not The foam means
that he went in breathing

Ah

WHALEY
Thats why the autopsy report
identifies drowning as the cause
of death

NELS
Meaning that he wasnt murdered
first say on the deck of the boat
and then thrown overboard

WHALEY
Well

NELS
Your report says death by drowning
which means he went into the water
alive and breathing And the report
is accurate

WHALEY (bristles)
Of course its accurate but

NELS
Of course it is Now as to the
head injury You say made by an
object narrow and flat That is
your inference correct

WHALEY (really pissed)
Its my job to infer thats what
coroners do You get hit with a
crowbar or a ball-peen hammer or
fall off a motorcycle the injuries
look different thats my area of
expertise

Nels nods He can be quiet now The witness distracted from
volunteering the opinions Nels did not wish for
Whaley thinks

NELS
In your motorcycle example Those
injuries are produced by the head
being propelled against an object
Rather than the reverse yes

WHALEY
Obviously

NELS
Can you tell whether an object moved
against the head or the other way
around Or would both look the same

WHALEY
The same

NELS
So if his head struck something
narrow and flat the gunnel of a
boat a net roller a fairlead
could that have

WHALEY
If the head was moving fast enough
but I dont see how it could be

NELS
Is it possible

WHALEY
Sure anythings poss

NELS
Is it fair to say that you do not
know for certain which it was

WHALEY
I already said that b

NELS
And that you cant say for
certain whether the head injury was
sustained before or after death

WHALEY
For certain no

NELS
But you are certain that he died
his

by drowning

WHALEY
For the third time yes

Nels nods Whaley is beyond frustrated

WHALEY
Can I say something here

NELS
Yes you can tell me about the
minor cut you found on the deceaseds
right hand The report says recent
origin How recent As much as 24
hours before death

WHALEY
Absolutely not Probably one or two
hours Four at the most

A pause
NELS
Are you absol
WHALEY
Yes Im sure
Nels nods Silence
NELS
Thank you Horace No more

questions
Horace wants to say more Doesnt immediately move

JUDGE
Well take our luncheon recess
Reconvene at2 oclock sharp

The gavel CRACKS onto the block Judge Fielding stands to leave
and the BAILIFF begins to usher the jury from its box Abel
Martinson the deputy stands near as Kabuo rises As he puts

hand gently on Kabuos arm the defendant turns smoothly

to face a woman Standing at the rail And beneath the
courtroom buzz

KABUO
How are the kids
The voice so colloquially American we are taken back Having
envisioned Kabuo as a silent Samurai

HATSUE
They need their father

The look holds Abel increasingly uneasy

KABUO
Well Just a few more days

ABEL (coughs)
Look Arts gonna want me t

KABUO (ignoring him)
You look beautiful

Abel grasps his arm

HATSUE
I look terrible Dont sit so
straight like Tojos soldier The
jury will be afraid of you

He thinks about that Abel tugs him

KABUO
Okay Ill hide under the table
from now on That make you happy

And for the first time He smiles And seems suddenly very
American indeed She stares back her heart in her eyes Abel
tugs harder but he cant budge the defendant

KABUO
Im not going until you smile

But she doesnt So his fades One last look And he lets Abel
lead him away

HOLD on her Watching him go
EXT MANZANAR INTERNMENT CAMP - NIGHT

Stars above a desert Wind gusts PAN barbed wire rows of dark
barracks blurred by swirling dust to

a fragile tar paper structure its walls rippling pre-
cariously And inside to see that it is

INT BUDDHIST CHAPEL - NIGHT
a makeshift sanctuary Candles offerings of fruit A young
COUPLE together before a Buddhist PRIEST Kabuo and Hatsue
Becoming one

INT BARRACKS - LATER

A cramped ramshackle room Dust blowing through gaps in the
flimsy beams Kerosene light FUJIKO IMADA hangs the last of
the woolen army blankets to divide the room in half as her four
youngest DAUGHTERS watch We PUSH THROUGH the blankets to the
other side to see

the newlyweds Standing at a window in their wedding clothes
Kissing Slow and full Until she whispers into his ear

HATSUE
Theyll hear everything

And her young husband turns Speaks to the curtain
KABUO (loud)
There must be something good on
the radio

She giggles His hands trace her body

KABUO (louder)
Wouldnt some music be nice

And in a moment The MUSIC begins Glenn Miller A song that
sent our boys off to war And our young American prisoners

-begin to undress each other Her slender fingers find the
buttons of his shirt deftly undoing it as he kisses her face
He unclasps her dress And as it falls from her shoulders falls
to the floor we PUSH INTO her eyes and

INTERCUT her MEMORY of

a beach Two 10-year-old CHILDREN floating on the water
Clinging to a wooden box with a glass bottom for fish-watching
The girl is Asian The boy is not

HATSUE
Ishmael See the yellow one

And the boy wriggles around leans over the box as if seeking a
better view And KISSES the girl Full on her startled mouth

BACK TOthe newlyweds On their cot now Close together
Naked
and hungry for each other

KABUO (loud)
Can the music be louder please
We cant hear so good in here

The girl laughs soundlessly And as the music BLARES he has
slid
his body above hers A whisper

KABUO
Have you ever done this

A whisper back sure and strong

HATSUE
Never Youre my only

And as he enters her As she holds him close with all her
strength Her lips breathe into his ear

HATSUE
»SoO right

INT COURTROOM - DAY

Hatsue watching her husband disappear through a door RACK FOCUS
to see across the way A man stares at her

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Course we grew up together

INT IMADA PARLOR - DAY

Hatsue at 12 sits with an OLD WOMAN who guides her silently
exquisitely through the ritual of the tea ceremony

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Her mom had this Mrs Shigemura
come on Wednesdays Teach her
how to be Japanese

The woman turns the cup in her hands One-quarter turn Bows
slightly as she presents the tea

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Dances calligraphy Doing her hair
How to sit without moving

EXT HOLLOW CEDAR - DAY
Hatsue and Ishmael both 12 are sprawled on the ground
sheltered

in the hollowed-out base of a cedar tree They watch the rain as

it pummels the woods around them She is speaking carefully

thoughtfully He listens with complete attention

ISHMAEL (V0O)
She would tell me stories of
this woman and her lessons As
if complaining or at least ex-
plaining her world

He shifts his position his body brushing against hers which
makes
him reflexively pull away She seems not to notice

ISHMAEL (V0O)
But I always fantasized The
lessons were for me

INT BEDROOM - DAY

Hatsue sits at a bedroom mirror Mrs Shigemura watching
analytically as Hatsue weaves her hair into a thick plait

MRS SHIGEMURA
No You must never look at a man
directly This is part of grace

The girl smiles a small sour smile Speaks quietly

HATSUE
I dont think the boys on this
island Are impressed By grace

The old woman studies her without irritation

MRS SHIGEMURA
Hakujin know nothing of life Hatsue

Apparently the girl has heard this before

MRS SHIGEMURA
This is why they fear death Because
life here is separate from Being

The girl takes a long pin Begins carefully to fasten her hair
Breaking eye contact with the mirror

MRS SHIGEMURA
It is why they have no soul
Is the girl even listening The old womans voice never rises
Remains patient

MRS SHIGEMURA
Life embraces death includes it
This truth brings tranquility You
must see yourself

HATSUE
-as a leaf On a great tree

No irony in the girls voice No disrespect The old woman
reads
the young face in the mirror

MRS SHIGEMURA
The pin Could be better placed

INT SAN PIEDRO REVIEW - DAY

CLOSE on 12-year-old Ishmael Neutral eyes Eating an apple
horrific CLANGING surrounds us The clash of metal on metal

ISHMAEL (V0O)
My lessons came from my father They
were different Or seemed so at the
time

See ARTHUR CHAMBERS now at the printing press an enormous lime

green contraption with rollers and conveyor pulleys in a cast-

iron housing The shrieking of metal and gears recalls an
ancient

locomotive

ISHMAEL (V0O)
He operated the Review alone with
an integrity and passion for principle
that made him a figure of respect If
slightly larger than life

Arthur is a large rugged man with round gun-metal rimmed
spectacles and garters on his shirtsleeves He wears the soft
perpetual smile of an Oxford Don as he gracefully ducks in and
out of the machine inspecting plates and printing cylinders

ISHMAEL (V0O)
He never spoke of wanting me to
succeed him And in truth it was
the last job on earth I thought Id
ever want
The boy rises now Sets his apple carefully aside And under
his

fathers supervision takes his place operating the press His

arms inches from the fearful clatter of the rollers

ISHMAEL (V0O)
When I was five he casually mentioned
that if his sleeve got caught in the
press hed be instantly popped open
like a childs balloon and splattered
across the walls

Watch Ishmael running the monster coolly efficiently with
complete concentration

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Even his bones would disappear to
be discovered later on the floor
as strips of white confetti

Arthur turns away lest his son feel a lack of confidence Picks
up the boys apple A crisp BITE

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Which of course made me certain that
life would have no meaning until I
could run that teakettle

EXT MAIN STREET AMITY HARBOR - SUNSET

Arthur and Ishmael now 17 strolling Main Street in the midst of
what seems a festive carnival

ISHMAEL (V0O)
He was for better or worse the
only God in my life I guess its
our nature to resent those we know
we can never measure up to

They are passing modest parade floats booths with food and
games

A genial crowd of farmers fishermen families both races

heedlessly mingling A community Arthur unselfconsciously
slips

his arm over the shoulder of his tall son

ISHMAEL (V0O)
-which keeps us from accepting
the warmth The way we should

Up ahead a crowd has gathered at the steps of the courthouse
Somethings up
ISHMAEL (V0O)
Every summer after harvest the
Strawberry Festival was Dads favor-
ite story to cover Good news was
his preference Making him an oddity
among journalists

As we approach we see a ceremony begin at the top of the
courthouse steps

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Highlight was crowning the Strawberry
Princess Always a Japanese girl
sort of an unwitting virgin sacrifice
to the concept of racial harmony

We are there now Arthur pulling down the same box camera

Ishmael

the

in

would use years later Focusing up at the MAYOR as he places
crown on the radiant young girl

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Senior Year It was Hatsue

And as the applause ripples through the crowd As the Strawberry
Princess acknowledges her subjects her eye falls on

Ishmael She drops him a wink And a special wave

ISHMAEL (V0O)
She winked at me In public
Which was unusual

EXT SOUTH BEACH - DAY
Two 14-year-olds alone on a beach Digging for clams in the mud

ISHMAEL (V0O)
I had kissed her once when we
were ten Looking at fish through
a glass-bottomed box It was just
an impulse and no big deal

Ishmael pulls back from the deep hole to make room for Hatsue to
reach down We can see her fingers explore the shell of the dug-

geoduck clam

HATSUE
Hes still got a good grip We
need to dig more

ISHMAEL (V0O)
At school she kept mostly to the
Japanese kids and sort of ignored
me As if all of our times alone
togetherin the hollow cedar
everywherewere a secret

They are digging now together Carefully

ISHMAEL (V0O)
I told myself that was good That
it made our friendship special And
didnt mean she was ashamed of it
Necessarily

HATSUE
Easy Slow is best

Gently she begins to dislodge the clam from its lair

ISHMAEL (V0O)
I thought about her Sometimes
all the time I knew I was unhappy
But I knew if I told her

She lifts it clear And as she admires its size and roughness
with

her fingertips As she washes it in the shallows He watches
her

movements

ISHMAEL (V0O)
It might be a mistake I could
never correct

ISHMAEL (quietly)
I like you

The words make her turn Not startled exactly Alerted But
neutral without affect

ISHMAEL
Do you know what I mean Hatsue
Ive always liked you

There is no answer He leans slightly closer and she looks
down This is the moment Afraid and driven he moves slowly
to her face And puts his mouth against hers She lets him and
encouraged he pushes harder making Hatsue
lose her balance and planting a hand beneath the water to
support herself eyes closed too tightly she kisses Ishmael for

long moment before

leaping up snatching her clam pail and running AWAY down the
beach like a deer He stands slowly To watch her go

ISHMAEL (V0O)
I knew in my heart that we would
love each other forever

His face is slack and unsmiling but he is helpless with
happiness
Contemplating this truth

ISHMAEL (V0O)
The way she kissed me She knew
it too

EXT IMADA FARM - DUSK
Ishmael crouching at the edge of the farm in near-darkness

ISHMAEL (V0O)
She avoided me for a week

Across the distance the screen door opens light slips across
the

porch Hatsue appears with a wicker basket to take the laundry

from the line

ISHMAEL (V0O)
So this way I could see her
withoutbothering anyone

He watches rapt as she unpins and folds the clothes clenching

the clothespins in her teeth Then reeling the line again
elegant

hand over elegant hand

ISHMAEL (VO)
I was certain everything would
work out

She corrals the long sweep of her hair knotting it deftly
before
heading inside

ISHMAEL (V0O)
And frightened
EXT STRAWBERRY FIELDS - DAY

Children working fields in sunlight Kneeling in the rows
Hatsue

with a half-dozen Japanese girls her hair loose her face
lightly

sheened with sweat She works with efficiency and grace filling

her flat

Three rows away Ishmael watches The fear not far beneath the
surface of his quiet dark features

ISHMAEL (V0O)
By two weeks I knew I had made
the defining mistake of my life

Hatsues gaze drifts slightly in this direction and Ishmael
looks

DOWN rapidly at his work Cheeks burning certain she is
watching

Which she is not

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Id ruined everything

LATERend of day The young pickers turning in their flats as

a
gentle rain begins Hatsue counts her money slips it into her
pocket and

runs lightly off into the growing rain Ishmael sees
Stricken to his soul with longing And indecision
EXT CEDAR GROVE - DAY
Hatsue drenched alone with her thoughts in the protection of
the hollow cedar The rain is driving now and she glances up
At something we dont see And watches it Finally
HATSUE

You followed me huh
PULL BACK to see him Rain pelting off his poor soaked form

She
is waiting for an answer So

ISHMAEL

Sorry It sort ofhappened I
justI followed you Im sorry

She pulls her hair behind her ears A movement which stretches
her
body

HATSUE
Im all wet

She starts refastening her hair now looking away He comes

inside crouches as respectfully far from her as he can Which
is

close He watches her watches her and

ISHMAEL
Im sorry I kissed you on
the beach

No reaction As if she hasnt heard Now his heart is beating
straight through his chest

ISHMAEL
Lets just forget about it
Forget it happened

She picks up her damp straw hat And eyes down tracing a
finger
around its brim

HATSUE
Dont be sorry Im not sorry
about it

His heart bursts within him And he struggles to keep it from
his
face Even though she isnt watching

ISHMAEL
Me neither

She turns her face to him and offers a small smile It is
genuine and therefore dazzling to the boy She lies back on
the ground Her eyes so unafraid and direct

HATSUE
Do you think this is wrong

He swallows Staring at her lying there so comfortably

ISHMAEL (V0O)
The best part was that there was a
this To debate the wrongness of

ISHMAEL
Your friends would Your dad would
kill me with a machete
HATSUE
Were Japanese not Mexican Ishmael
Hell slice you up with a ceremonial
sword

Ah Better They are both grinning now

HATSUE
My mom Would be the problem

ISHMAEL
Why Were only talking

Her eyes flicker The synapse that a woman can offer a man

HATSUE (softly)
Sure

And touches his hand With her fingertips The barest
whisper

HATSUE
I cant hear you

Thus invited he leans down over Hatsue Kisses her mouth with
all

the tenderness in him This time her eyes close gently And
her

body arches slightly into his

ISHMAEL (V0O)
We kissed for half an hour that
first time And I knew there would
never be another day like it

Rain POUNDING now A curtain of water sealing them from the
world

ISHMAEL (V0O)
No matter how long I lived

INT COURTROOM - DAY

KABUO
Im not sure I better check

Kabuo smiles only with his eyes Nels nods maybe you better
Lights his own cigar Puts the matches and the other cigar at
Kabuos side

NELS
White or black

KABUO
You mean do I like to take the
offensive Or hang back and wait

That seems answer enough for Nels He turns the board around to
where he has white and makes the first move

NELS
Nice When two fellas understand
each other

Kabuo picks up the cigar STRIKES a match

blinks studies the board silently Then smiles

He unwraps the Snickers bar Breaks it in half Hands one piece
across to his lawyer

Hands one cigar

Takes the cigar

STRIKES a match

Reaches stiffly
Takes a puff

You wouldnt even see it move
NELS
Youre wonderinhow come I

Across the chessboard

NELS
Now youve told me you killed
four men In Germany So I know

KABUO (very quiet)
Guess I am

Rolls it between his thumb and forefinger

NELS
You feel guilty That you took
their lives Thats in your eyes

NELS (softly)
Jury sees what I see More often
than not

Kabuo bends toward him Accepts the flame
NELS

Prosecutor thinks What was
your reason To kill Carl Heine

Kabuo says not a word

NELS
Well there is the land itself
Raise your children where you
were raised Sleep with your
wife at night stead of bein
alone on the sea

Brings the match to his own cigar Careful Expert

camp You go off to fight for our
countrys freedom Come back to this

Shakes his head

NELS
But Mr Hooks has missed the one
reason One reason You coulda

A flicker Behind the defendants eyes

NELS
I read you Etta Heines deposition
So I could watch your mind Like I
do when you move your rook or when
I move mine

A smile now Very kind Very sad

NELS
And you werent thinking about her

No you werent And in the gentlest voice
NELS
No someone cheats you you can
rise above that Youre a family
man You put them ahead of you hmmn

He sighs But

NELS
Wasnt you she dishonored

And the old watering eyes are rock steady now

NELS
Your father was a strong and
tireless man Honest to a fault
Kind and humble as well

There is a silence And then

KABUO (real quiet)
Nice When two fellas Understand

NELS
So every time you think about
showing that jury strength Or
honor or composure Or dignity

KABUO
I should show them an American

Nels sees the rage It breaks his heart It makes him feel old
and helpless

opaque
as the voice is quiet

our neighbors they have sent their
sons to the United States Army

Print flying onto paper as it rolls through the green metal
gauntlet

ISHMAEL (V0O)
They are no more an enemy than
our fellow islanders of German or
Italian descent

Belary-eyed Ishmael pulling finished copies from the bin As
he stacks them for delivery he reads aloud above the CLASH of
metal

ISHMAEL (sleepy and loud)
LET US SO LIVE THAT WHEN IT IS OVER
WE CAN LOOK EACH OTHER IN THE EYE
AND KNOW WE HAVE ACTED HONORABLY
Big yawn Its really late He turns and sees
-his father Staring at him

ISHMAEL (VO)
I guess courage never inspires the
young Until the danger of it bites
their butt

EXT WOODS - TWILIGHT

They walk slowly up the path An arm around each others waist
their bodies brushing as they go

ISHMAEL

She stops By a weathered fence covered in vines Its growing
dark

HATSUE
Its not going to get better okay

She sighs He moves close looks so grave

HATSUE
They arrested Mr Shirazaki

transmitter And his family cant

He reaches Touches this face that he loves with all his heart
Forces up a smile

She leans up CROSSES her eyes in a goofy expression Then
kisses
his mouth When she pulls back

ISHMAEL

Whatever happens

And she studies this boy Knowing more than he can ever
understand And chooses to whisper

HATSUE

INT IMADA FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Hatsue and her older daughter are setting the farmhouse table as
snow drifts down beyond the window Plates and flatware
Glasses

and napkins Slowly in silence as if a ritual bonding mother
and

daughter She glances to the next room

her mother Fujiko plays with the babies Her father HISAO
reads

the paper Smoking his pipe
And Hatsue is motionless for a moment Watching him

INT IMADA FARMHOUSE - DAY

CLOSE on Hatsue at 18 staring with silent anger greater than her
fear

HISAO (0S shaky)
We are loyal

PULL BACK to see the room Hatsue and her sisters side by side
staring at the table On it rests a shotgun four boxes of
shells

a ceremonial sword An FBI AGENT a small man in a dark suit is
tagging each item He wears a light perpetual insincere smile

FUJIKO
Everyone on the island has
these things

Fujiko at her husbands side She is quietly indignant He is
frightened
AGENT (overly casual)
Well theyll hold this stuff for
a little bit then ship it back to
you Its nothing to worry about

And walks over to the tansu a chest of drawers and begins to
remove items

AGENT
You folks have been real polite
and well be outta your hair in
just a second

a Silk kimono with gold brocaded sash

AGENT
Thats very nice From the old
country it appears Very high class

And lays it on another table Next to a bamboo flute a stack of
shakuhachi sheet music

Hisao sees his wifes sudden alarm And as respectfully as he
can
manage

HISAO

AGENT
»oh yeh any old country stuff

And sees on the sofa an open album Strolls over
FUJIKO

This is only my daughters
scrapbook For her memories

So he picks it up Doesnt see Hatsue stiffen with repulsion as
he wanders thumbing through it toward the hallway

AGENT (calling out)
Wilson Dont go pawing through

the underwear

And chuckles He knows they appreciate a joke It means theres
nothing to be afraid of Stops turning pages now Looks up his
eyes moving until they find Hatsue

AGENT

The soft slamming of a screen door Another AGENT large and
shambling in his too-small suit is carrying a crate Anda
telling look

AGENT 2 (quiet triumph)
Dynamite Twenty-four sticks

And the crate BANGS onto the table Just beside the kimono
Lifts
out two sticks and holds them high Proof

HISAO
You must believe This for tree
stumps For clearing land

The small mans smile fades now First time And his eyes fix
Hisao before he speaks As if reading his mind

AGENT
Maybe Maybe But this is still
bad ysee

Fujiko slips her hand into her husbands To give him strength

AGENT
Its illegal contraband you were
sposed to turn this stuff in
We uh

Slight shrug

AGENT
We gotta arrest you Have to
take you to Seattle

Fujikos breath catches One of the daughters whimpers The
silence hangs thick and frightening The bigger agent unhooks a
pair of handcuffs from his belt but

AGENT
Naw you dont need those Mister

Her voice so loud so insistent Her sisters are afraid for her
To have shown such disrespect They look down at their hands
Or

away as if not hearing

FUJIKO (quietly slowly)
I see this This lack of purity
is a mist around your soul I see
it every day it haunts your face
in unguarded moments

The room is still as the grave The mothers eyes burn silently

FUJIKO
I see it in your eagerness to
leave here And walk the woods
In the afternoon

What does she know Hatsues heart pounding And to her
surprise
her mothers voice softens

FUJIKO
If you lose your true self Hatsue

EXT HOLLOW CEDAR - DUSK

They lie so close Their bodies touching not moving

faces
inches apart so that every word is a murmur

HATSUE
Youre like me Youve learned

Their
to be devious

Hes never seen her this fragile this scared He knows he has
to
be strong for her

ISHMAEL
Its not devious its what we have
to do Youre leaving tomorrow

He unties her hair So gently Tries to keep his smile calm
steady

ISHMAEL
You write to my house and put
Kenny Yamashitas name on the
return address Its no big deal

He brings his face to her hair Kisses it

ISHMAEL
You smell like cedar

Her eyes are wide They move over his face A murmured

HATSUE
So do you Its your smell Ill
miss as much as anything

He looks in her eyes And words come from his heart before he
can
stop them

ISHMAEL
Lets get married okay

Her eyes fill with tears Are they from happiness

ISHMAEL
I want to marry you Is that okay

Her face so still One tear falls and he kisses it

ISHMAEL (a whisper)
Just say yes

No answer Not knowing what to say she winds an arm behind his

head and brings him nearer His mouth opens into hers with
more

force more of his heart than he has ever given Deep and
tender

His hands reach beneath her dress
peel her panties down her thighs

ISHMAEL (VO)
When something that means your
whole life Is the last time ever

And suddenly he is OVER her drawing her legs up around him

ISHMAEL (VO)
God should tell you Or its not
fair

Her head tilts back her eyes squeeze closed And as he enters
her

ISHMAEL (whispers)
Please say yes

her hands GRASP his upper arms And push away

HATSUE (softly)
No

And he blinks As if waking from a dream Everything has

stopped
Her face is strong and yet overflowing with regret

HATSUE
No No It isnt right

So he draws away Stunned uncomprehending Watching with blank
eyes as she stares up at him Then with dignity and

tenderness
he helps her dress his eyes awkwardly away from hers

ISHMAEL
It felt right to me It felt
like getting married

She draws her legs up Kneeling now putting her hands on his
face

But no words come No words Until

HATSUE
Ill write you

And KISSES him fiercely and BOLTS up before he can grab her
RUNNING off like a deer while he

-kneels His mouth open Like a silent scream
EXT AMITY HARBOR FERRY - MORNING

An army truck pulls up behind several others in cold morning air

Hesitantly looking in all directions Fujiko Hatsue and her
four

sisters climb from the truck to see

ISHMAEL (V0O)
On Monday March 30 1942 the
United States Army graciously
transported the Imada women to
the docks

a ferry the KEHLOKEN stands waiting Soldiers are dis-

tributing tags for luggage and coats The evacuees mostly
women

stand in the cold trying to smile bravely for each other And

lined against the railing

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Lifelong neighbors came to watch
Curiosity masked as kindness

a cluster of white islanders gawking as their Japanese
neighbors

file toward the ferry A middle-aged woman waves to Fujiko who

casts her eyes down refusing to acknowledge the greeting And

just as they reach the gangway

Hatsue sees Ishmael who stands at an unobtrusive distance
among a group of students She pauses Her eyes hold his for a
heartbeat

ISHMAEL (V0O)
with some exceptions

The wisp of a smile And she is gone
EXT IMADA FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Hatsue comes alone onto the white-blanketed porch Snow is no

longer falling She takes out a cigarette lights it
impassively

The mannerisms make her seem fully American despite the
porcelain

impenetrability of her Asian exterior She closes her eyes
and

draws deep on the smoke The act seems to cause her pain
When

the eyes open they are frightened unguarded Nowhere to turn
The next puff looks desperate and she FLIPS the cigarette out

onto
the snow Jams her hands in the pockets of her parka stamps her
feet against the cold the helplessness And looks out
Strawberry fields endless and white shimmering in filtered
moonlight become
EXT MANZANAR INTERNMENT CAMP - NIGHT
a moonlit DESERT PAN the barbed wire the distant barracks
the desolation Come to
two women walking alone The younger one glancing at her
mother

as they go Fujikos eyes unreadable stare implacably ahead
The barracks everything in distance behind them

HATSUE
You think were far enough
away now

No sarcasm in the voice She lets the words carry her irony
Her mother stops Looks at her so directly so strong Even her
tough-minded daughter flinches slightly

HATSUE
Mom whatever this is they dont
keep war secrets this carefully

Fujiko thinks that over Nods

FUJIKO
Secrets are hard to keep

She goes over to a large flat rock Sits down Pulls two

sheets
of paper from her coat And waits As her daughter comes and
crouches at her feet Fujiko clears her throat

FUJIKO
This letter Was opened
By mistake

And watches As the shard of fear penetrates her daughters
mask
Silence Then

FUJIKO (reads)
My love I still go to our
cedar tree in the afternoons every
day I shut my eyes waiting
Hatsue has turned to stone To ice Wind blows

I smell your smell And I dream

of you And I ache for you to come

home So I can hold you and feel

you near

Fujiko scans the page silently Turns to the second
FUJIKO (reads)

After all these years that weve

been together I find youre a

part of me Without you I have

How deceitful of me

Anger only at the edges Like finely-honed steel

FUJIKO
How can I ever hope For your
forgiveness

The wind swirls a cloud of dust between them They seem not to

notice

FUJIKO
I have written this letter to
the boys parents

She pulls out a single page Hands it down to her daughter

Hatsues eyes move quickly over the words

FUJIKO
Attraction is no crime certainly
among children The dishonor
lies in the concealment From
your families
Watches her daughter reading And quietly

No contact of any k

And stops Because Hatsue is TEARING the page in two She looks
up Into her mothers shock

HATSUE
One more letter I will write
it You may read it and send
it for me

Her mothers anger fades Into interest

HATSUE
I deceived more than you I
deceived this sweet boy And
myself It was never love

Never love The mothers face changes There is understanding
acceptance Even pride

HATSUE
I will work hard To earn your
forgiveness

A sigh A sadness deep beyond her years

HATSUE
I can never hope for his

Mother and daughter enter their crude quarters They find

One is building shelves two others a chest of drawers Their
leader kneels tacking scraps of tin over the knotholes on the
floor One girl beams at her mother

The leader grins and rises Bows slightly to Fujiko He is of

FUJIKO
We are in your debt Miyamoto-san
How are your parents your family

KABUO

And glances To the eldest daughter In the doorway

KABUO
Hi Hatsue remember me

She looks back without expression There is much on her mind
His smile is handsome easy

KABUO
I was a senior when you were a
junior But Ive seen you around

She tosses her hair free of the parka Gathers it in her hands
Saying only

HATSUE
Hello

Cant win a smile but he doesnt seem to mind

KABUO
Nice to see you

EXT APARTMENT HOUSE REAR PORCH - NIGHT
Ishmael steps from the building onto the rear porch He draws

his coat a black CIGAR Box of matches The cigar goes into his
mouth With amazing dexterity
-he slips a single match from the box turns his face to the
wall and still palming the box STRIKES a match on the buckle of
his belt bringing it smoothly to the cigar for a few critical
puffs before the match dies He turns toward

the fields Stretching treeless endless seemingly to the

landing

craft as his platoon enters Tarawa lagoon Bobbing past two

DESTROYERS firing in waves at the beach Ishmael and his platoon

mates watch with adrenaline-fueled fear as amphibious tractors
draw

fire on the sand one exploding in flame

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Her letter reached me on the North
Island of New Zealand So I hada
month to think it over

Men around him are shouting cursing jostling against each
other

frightened out of their minds as SHELLS POUND the ocean
horrify-

ingly huge and near

ISHMAEL (V0O)
I wrote her four times I hate
you with all my heart I hate you
Hatsue Ill hate you always

Suddenly their craft runs AGROUND on the hidden reef They are
still 300 yards from shore

ISHMAEL (V0O)
I never sent the letters I wanted
to kill as many Japs as possible

LETS GO

The SQUAD LEADER goes over the side Ishmael and others follow

struggling with 85 pound packs As Ishmael hits the water the

squad leader is SHOT in the face a man five yards from Ishmael
has

the top of his head BLOWN AWAY men are DROPPING in numbers under
the WITHERING BURSTS of fire the deafening ordnance sweeping
over
the SHRIEKS of terror and agony and Ishmael

Ssubmerges behind his pack splashing hard keeping its bulk

ahead of him as a shield until he can wade and swim and plunge

toward shore as hellfire CRASHES everywhere dead bodies
floating

machine-gun blasts WHIPPING the waters surface Ishmael at

the shallows now men rising to make a run at the seawall
being

CUT DOWN Ishmael crouching in the water watching other men draw

fire and in a moments lull four of them and Ishmael

GO for it lungs BURSTING pounding MADLY up the sand one

SHOT DEAD another SCREAMS as his knee is blown away and goes
down

writhing as three men

MAKE IT to the wall Gasping puking shivering with cold and
fright They have no gear no weapons One of them is Ishmael
He looks back to

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Eric Bledsoe was bleeding to death
Thirty yards away

Bullets FLYING everywhere CHEWING up the sand The young man
twitching pleading

BLEDSOE (crying)
Oh shit please please help me
you guys come on help me fucking
help me PLEASE

And flat against the seawall three men watch Not daring to
look
at each other

ISHMAEL (V0O)
I knew nothing could save him Hell
I didnt have so much as a band-aid
I also knew I was a coward For not
giving up my life to try

EXT SEAWALL - DAY

Ishmael and his companions have been joined by others Sixty or
so men mill in the shadow of the seawall The beach is littered
with dead marines and wounded calling for help As Ishmael
glances up a SERGEANT leaps ONTO the seawall cigarette dangling
from his mouth

SERGEANT
You pussies are the kinda chickenshits
deserve to have your balls chewed
off real slow when this is over

Stands with his hands on his hips The men below him properly
mesmerized

SERGEANT
Any man who wont follow me over

a half-inch hard-on wh

The words CUT OFF by the shell that RIPS THROUGH his spine
OPENING
his shirt front as he PITCHES forward FLAT upon the sand

No one looks No one speaks It never happened

I wanted to live And I didnt
know why

EXT SEAWALL - NIGHT

Ishmael has a carbine now and a field machete PULL BACK to
reveal

300 MARINES all down the wall a striking force assembled from
the

survivors of multiple landings

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Some colonel came down the beach
Any man who didnt go over the wall
at 2100 would be court-martialed
disgraced and imprisoned

Every man lining up now rifles at the ready

ISHMAEL (V0O)
The captain who followed said shot
on sight

They seem more resigned or is it stunned numb than terrified
There is no interaction Each man dealing with his own insides
And suddenly

squad leaders go OVER THE WALL the firing ERUPTS and three
hundred marines SCRAMBLE into the teeth of it mortar and
machine-
gun BARRAGE lighting the sky from the row of battered palm trees

pharmacists mate whose surgical
career was four hours old

He used a handsaw

seeing there in a corner on a pile of blood-soaked
dressings

The way my fingers curled
Against the wall

He blinks at it Realizing at last that the arm is his

the bare bulb glows Its light throws shadows of castles and
horses across the chessboard

eyes
calm Stare at the pieces

place is shielded by trees PAN across the ground to

The father never looks at the son Only at his work

ZENHICHI
He killed himself On the
battlefield At Kumamoto

The boy knows this Yet his entire being is focused on every
word

ZENHICHI
He went to battle with a sword
Against rifles mind you Knowing
what honor required

An elegant SWORD Its curved blade gleaming in the lantern
light

ZENHICHI
He was angry To the point of
being crazy yes But he knew
what honor Required

A separate sack just for this Folded with respect
ZENHICHI
Honor can require loyalty
Revenge Death

It goes into the ground With the others He seems nearly

overcome now By some emotion that sweeps through him
Prompting

the boy to murmur

KABUO
These are safe father The

ZENHICHI (quietly)
it is the only scale

Meaning be still So the boy is still

ZENHICHI
Only scale In which our worth
Is weighed

The man gazes into the hole At his treasures

Every life ends And if it ends
dishonored It is as if

And turns to his son To complete the words

Sheriff Moran sits in the witness box blade-thin and fidgeting
ever so slightly Uncomfortable in the limelight In his hands
are four pieces of ROPE

MORAN
Well this one here comes off
Miyamotos boat Matches all his
others worn equal and so on But
this one here

Holds it up for Hooks So the jury can see
MORAN

comes off third cleat from the
stern port side And its brand
Ah

I see

Hooks nods

new Unlike the rest

HOOKS
And the next one

MORAN
From Carl Heines boat All his
were like this one three-strand
manila new condition braided in
loops Not bowlined like Miyamotos

HOOKS
And the last

MORAN
Found on Carls boat too Starboard
side second cleat from the stern
But it doesnt match Carls lines
It matches Miyamotos perfect

Significant

HOOKS
So if defendant had tied up
to deceaseds boat With that
last one Would those cleats
have lined up

MORAN
You bet And if Miyamoto there
had been in a hurry to cast off
he coulda left this line behind
on Carls boat

HOOKS
And replaced it later with the
new one Thats your inference
MORAN

Pretty darn clear

Hooks begins to pace Toward the jury

HOOKS
And when you visited defendant on
his boat The evening after Carl
Heines death Did it seem pretty
darn clear to him

EXT THE ISLANDER - NIGHT

Kabuo kneeling at the battery well of his boat He is

sliding a
new BATTERY into place Beside its older companion He bolts it
down Starts his engine He is visibly tense As he steps onto
the deck he sees

two figures at the pilings Sheriff Moran makes a cutting
motion across his throat as Abel moves to grasp the mooring

line
MORAN
Cut your engine were coming
aboard
Kabuo doesnt move The tension has fled beneath the surface
His
face now a mask
KABUO
What for Sheriff
MORAN
We have a warrant To search
your boat
He holds it up Abel looks uneasy as if expecting anything
KABUO
Well what are you looking f
MORAN (calmly)
A murder weapon We think you
might be responsible for the death
of Carl Heine
Kabuo blinks As if hearing a foreign language Words that do
not

compute

KABUO
Sheriff if somebody killed Carl
it sure as hell wasnt me

Moran steps from the dock ONTO the boat Abel awkwardly
following

MORAN
Then lets get this over with so
you can get to fishin Now cut

yor engine

And walks ahead into the cabin shining his flashlight across
everything Kabuo follows killing the engine And in the
sudden
silence Morans beam finds
the still-open battery well

MORAN
You always run with the well open

KABUO
I was checking the cables

Morans light moves over the batteries

MORAN
D-6s huh

And says no more Runs his beam once more around the cabin

MORAN
Well come back lets take a
look at the stern

Off he goes Kabuos glance goes to the open well Then
follows

noticing Abel Martinson prowling around the bow But in the
stern

Moran is shining his light Third cleat Port side

MORAN
See you replaced a mooring line

KABUO
Naw I had that around for a while

MORAN

MORAN
You gaff with the hook end
Bloods on the butt Where

hand Sheriff ask any fisherman

Moran takes out a handkerchief Holds the gaff with it

MORAN

Kabuos face has gone dead Which makes it seem somehow fierce
almost threatening And the sheriff is watching that

MORAN
Im sorry son But youre under
arrest

INT COURTROOM - DAY

Moran still on the stand The ropes are gone now His hands
interlock across his narrow thighs

NELS (0S)
Now your testimony was interrupted
yesterday when that power line
set fire to your mother-in-laws
farmhouse

Art looks really irritated
NELS (0S)
How is your mother-in-law

MORAN
Shes alright Nels thanks
for asking

NELS (0S)
And her farmhouse
MORAN

The damage was considerable
But shes insured Thanks again

See Nels now Avuncular as hell Bemused by Morans annoyance

NELS
Well just to put it back in
our minds could you repeat what
you told us About the type of
batteries you found One Carls boat

Moran sighs Tries to be patient

MORAN
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well
And a dead D-8 on the deck

NELS
Which you inferred was replaced by
the D-6 which must have been a spare

MORAN
What else could it be

NELS

Even though a D-6 is too big and

the flange had to be banged out to
squeeze it in

(beat)

Which makes it a peculiar choice

For a spare

MORAN
You said that That was your
testimony

Everybody laughs Including Nels

NELS (chuckling)
I guess Im a pretty smart feller
after all And what were the type
batteries you found on defendants
boat

MORAN (bland)
D-6s Like I sa

NELS
No further questions

INT COURTROOM - DAY

DR STERLING WHITMAN sits in his expensive suit a giant of a man

whose towering frame ill fits the witness box His eyes are
small

and blue and carry the weight of superiority with practiced
ease

NELS (0S)
So the blood on the gaff was not
fish blood at all It was human
yes Type B positive

DR WHITMAN
Carl Heines type

Nels nodding Seemingly unconcerned by this fact

NELS
But you cant say with any certainty
that the blood was his

DR WHITMAN
No but as I say the type is rare
Ten percent of Caucasian males

NELS
And the blood could not have
belonged to defendant Seeing
that his type is O negative

DR WHITMAN
Thats obvious

NELS
You scraped the dried blood from
the butt of the gaff Where a fellas
hand goes And what did you see under
your microscope besides the B positive
blood and the wood scrapings

And the witness stops A curious question But Nels is waiting
With an expectant smile

DR WHITMAN
Bits of blood and wood What else
would there be

NELS
No bits of bone no particles of
scalp no strands of hair

DR WHITMAN
None

NELS
Well if the blood got onto the
gaff by crushing a mans skull

DR WHITMAN
Im a hemotologist sir I was
asked only t

NELS (gently persistent)
would that seem logical

DR WHITMAN
I dont know

NELS
You dont

Nels lifts the gaff off the table Looks at it
NELS
The coroner testified that Carl
Heine had a cut A fresh cut
Probably one or two hours old

And grasps the butt end Of the gaff

NELS
On the palm Of his right hand

Walks dragging one leg just slightly toward the box

holding
the butt of the gaff toward him

NELS
With no bone or scalp or hair
present Would it be more probable
that the blood came from crushing
a mans skull

And
DR WHITMAN
Im a hemotologist not a detective

NELS
or from the cut on his hand
Which is more probable

Whitman wont be badgered His smile carries only a trace of
coldness

DR WHITMAN
It is not my function To weigh
those probabilities

Nels looks him over

NELS
Youre right

And turns his back Walks away

NELS
thats the jurys job

He is crisp
HOOKS
Now this regiment you were training

First Sergeant VICTOR MAPLES wears his green dress uniform
splashed with decorations Thick and powerful no neck razor
cut

The eyes are alive

MAPLES
They were Japanese-American boys
yes sir

HOOKS

And you were generally experienced
in training men for hand-to-hand
combat

MAPLES
It was my specialty sir I trained
several thousand over the years
HOOKS
So Wide cross-section of men to
evaluate And the day that the
defendant volunteered for this
demonstration Did you find him
eager

MAPLES
More than eager He was out to
make a point

Hooks finds that interesting Begins to pace

HOOKS
And what point Was that

EXT TRAINING FIELD CAMP SHELBY MISSISSIPPI - DAY

The squad of Nisei recruits one hundred young Asian faces
surround Sgt Maples He paces before them holding up a wooden
staff looking in their eyes

MAPLES
Anyone

And Kabup steps forward Bows slightly Then salutes

KABUO

Maples stares Hard
MAPLES
You dont salute me you dont
call me sir soldier Im an

enlisted man
Kabuo stares back Blank

MAPLES
And nobody bows in this mans
Army youre in America son
Not Japan

KABUO
Im sorry sir force of habit

MAPLES
No more sir Thats the last
of that
Tosses Kabuo a wooden staff and a helmet A little hard As
Kabuo
slips the helmet on

MAPLES
The exercise is avoiding thrusts
Now first y

KABUO (quietly)
Ready sergeant

Cut off in mid-word Maples glares back Are you THRUSTS
sharply but Kabuo moves just enough to slip the blow by no more
than an inch Their eyes lock Suddenly Maples unleashes

a SAVAGE series of THRUSTS at blinding SPEED and Kabuo

SLIPS them all effortlessly scarcely seeming to move As a
man

might toy with a child Maples studies the face for any trace of

mockery And sees nothing at all STABS out only to have
Kabuo

SLASH Maples staff from his grasp with a move so quick as to
be nearly invisible Maples clearly STUNNED by the display

KABUO (quietly)
Excuse me

He bends picks up Maples staff hands it to him And bows
Slightly The sergeant is hot He looks into the faces of this
Nisei regiment searching for a single smirk There is none

MAPLES
Are you ready for some simulated
combat soldier

KABUO
For combat Sergeant

And Maples LUNGES with surprising speed to be SWEPT off his feet
in a BLUR lying FLAT on the earth his head PINNED to the ground
by the tip of Kabuos staff

A hush Kabuo withdraws his staff Retrieves Maples’

KABUO (just above a whisper)
Your weapon sergeant

And bows

INT COURTROOM - DAY
Maples smiling easily Like a guy telling the story in a bar

HOOKS
Well what then sergeant

MAPLES
What else I had the boy teach
me kendo Includingthe importance
of the bow

Everyone laughs Maples the loudest Hooks smiles like a
regular
Joe

HOOKS
And your evaluation of the
defendant Could he kill a much
larger man with a fishing gaff
So quickly there would be no
sign of struggle

MAPLES
Oh in a heartbeat

And the smiles are gone All around

MAPLES
Able and willing Like few men
Ive ever seen

INT COURTROOM - DAY

Hooks sits against the prosecution table His demeanor gentle
respectful His voice soft

HOOKS
So the plan was for your husband
to fish through the prime season
Then in November sell the boat
And you would move onto the farm

In the box the widow sits in lovely dignity Blonde and
alabaster
and modest in her black dress of mourning

SUSAN MARIE
That was his plan yes

In the press row the boys are attentive An angle they know
they
can sell Ishmael among them watching with neutral eyes
ISHMAEL (V0O)
Whatever she said she was Hooks
star witness The jury especially
the men would not betray this fine
lady with a not guilty verdict How
could they face her

Hooks walks slowly toward her As if she were a precious object
deserving of reverence

HOOKS
Can you think back for me to the
morning of September 8 The day
after your husband purchased the
farm One week before his death
Can you recall that morning

SUSAN MARIE
I can

toward the opaque shower door TOWARD the sound of rushing water
And of breathing THROUGH it to

neck
Her legs wrapped around his body feet locked behind the small of
his back Carl holds her high with his strong hands so he can
lick her breasts to the rhythm of the slow slow thrusts Her
wet
blonde hair is pasted across her face and her eyes are closed
The intensity holds us

Concerned

CARL (0S)
What could I tell him Theres
my mother to think about You

Susan Marie knows What Etta would say

CARL (0S)
I said Id think it over talk
with you

SUSAN MARIE
Did he go away angry

See Carl now pacing his own parlor like a caged bear
in
a way we could not have expected

CARL
He kept talkin about those seven
acres belonged to his father and
how honorable and decent his father
was His meaning was pretty clear
And I didnt much like it

SUSAN MARIE
You had a scrap

Nursing her baby Calm direct

CARL
I couldnttalk to him Look
Kabuos a Jap And I dont hate
Japs but I dont like em neither
Its hard to explain if you werent
in the war you know

SUSAN MARIE
Hes not a Jap You dont mean
that You and he were friends

And Carl turns Looks at her A full beat

CARL
We were kids

Agitated
He looks helpless Frustrated He doesnt want his anger to
spill
onto her

He leaves the room Without a word HOLD on her

to believe he might sell toh

SUSAN MARIE
I wouldnt say encouraged

NELS (0S)
Well he didnt say no did he

SUSAN MARIE
Not in those words

NELS (0S)
So the defendant was encouraged
to hope Or could have been

She thinks about this

SUSAN MARIE
I guess so

Nels is nodding Nodding

NELS
I guess youd have to guess
Not having been there with them
Having to guess whether your husbands
report was word for word accurate

SUSAN MARIE
Carl never lied

NELS
Of course not But it was
emotional A friends plea set
against his mothers attitude

And then As if it had just occurred to him
NELS
Those dirty looks Defendant

INT ISHMAELS DESOTO CENTER VALLEY - TWILIGHT

Ishmael driving an aged DeSoto through the blanketed strawberry
for

fields of Center Valley

ISHMAEL (V0O)
My father had bought the DeSoto
fifteen years before Driving it
reminded me of him Which I
considered a neutral fact

He turns the wheel using a cherry wood knob specially mounted
his convenience

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Actually it was pleasant

Following the curve fields are pure white to the horizon

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Snow made all the fields into one
The notion that one man might kill
another for a small patch made no
sense

Up ahead a Willys station wagon has run into a ditch A middle
aged Japanese man is working at a rear wheel with a shovel

ISHMAEL (V0O)
But I knew such things occurred
Having been to war and all

The man is Hisao Imada and we can now see his eldest daughter
working with a shovel behind the car Ishmael pulls up behind
them And gets out

He crunches over to where Hisao works

ISHMAEL
May I give you folks a lift

Hatsue has come around the car now pulling her snowflaked hair
from her eyes

ISHMAEL (V0O)
I didnt look at her I thought
that would be best

Her eyes on Ishmaels profile Hatsue goes to her fathers side
Murmurs to him in Japanese WHen he answers she turns to face
Ishmael

HATSUE
My father is grateful for your
kindness But he will free his
car shortly

Ishmael smiles softly This car isnt going anywhere He goes

to
Hatsue reaching gently for her shovel
ISHMAEL
Okay Ill help
INT DESOTO SOUTH BEACH DRIVE - TWILIGHT
Ishmael drives with Hisao beside him
ISHMAEL
I know its caused you trouble
But dont you think the snow is
beautiful coming down
His eyes flick to Hatsue in the rearview mirror She stares out
the side window concentrating on the world Two strands of wet
hair pasted against her cheek
HISAO
Yes very beautiful
Suddenly her eyes SNAP to meet Ishmaels in the mirror His
dart

away Hers hold

HATSUE
This trial is unfair You should
write about that in your newspaper

He keeps driving And he keeps his eyes on the road

ISHMAEL (calmly)
What should I say

HATSUE
Just that This trial is wrong
they are calling a good man a killer
It is only about prejudice and that
is unfair

He thinks As he drives Hisao Imada silent beside him

ISHMAEL
We all expect the world to be fair
As if we have some right t

HATSUE
I dont mean everyone Just people
who can do things because they can
arrest people or convict them Or
run a newspaper

And his eyes come up Meet hers in the mirror

ISHMAEL
Maybe I should write a column
What do you think

She studies his face

HATSUE
What do you think

No smile On either side

ISHMAEL
I think people Should be fair

His eyes on the road now The farmhouse seen through the
drifting
screen of white

HATSUE
Will you write that

Her voice is soft The difference is palpable

ISHMAEL
I might just

His voice is kindness and friendship

awkwardly down This makes the others turn And Hatsues eyes

No one knows where to look Down away anything But Hatsue
never blinks

ISHMAEL
They shot it off At Tarawa

She holds her ground her eyes soften somehow Somewhere
between

compassion and pity Her slender fingers stroke the baby at her

shoulder

ISHMAEL
Im sorry Im sorry I said that

All the feeling comes to his eyes Everything he will never tell
her A murmur

ISHMAEL
Im sorry about everything All
of it

He drops his milk and crackers on the counter

And walks away

Open

In heavy fog

His finger Traces a line of the report

ISHMAEL (V0O)
They radioed to the lighthouse
They would have to dogleg bisecting
Ship Channel Bank And Seaman Philip
Milholland wrote that down In his
report

Ishmael closes his eyes

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Carl Heine drowned In Ship
Channel Bank And his watch
stopped At 147

He looks out through the glass As if he could watch it happen

ISHMAEL (VO)
A huge freighter plowing through
Throwing a wake big enough to fling
any man overboard

And Ishmael removes the page from the file Slowly he folds it
into quarters Slides it into his coat pocket

ISHMAEL (calls out)
Seaman

And closes the file Slips it back into the cabinet Levant
appears vaguely irritated by the summons So Ishmael smiles
Sorry nothing important

ISHMAEL
How long you have this detail

LEVANT
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch
September 16

Ishmaels face Just to clarify

ISHMAEL
You mean early morning the 16th

LEVANT
No night of the 16th morning the

Miller and Milholland

Oh Ishmael nods

LEVANT
They got transferred that day
Out to Cape Flattery

It sat in my desk for two weeks

Before I threw it away
He sighs Rises slowly

ISHMAEL (VO)
I knew her car And sometimes
when Id see it Iddrive t
way At a distance

hat

See Hatsue down on the beach Alone raking for steamer clams
Her baby beside her on a blanket beneath an umbrella
Ishmael walks down to the sand Crosses to where she works And
squats down At a respectful distance

ISHMAEL
Can I talk to you

She must have seen who was coming Because the words do not
startle her Or slow her work

HATSUE
Im married Ishmael It isnt
right for us to be alone People
will t

ISHMAEL

Theres no one here and Ive got
to talk to you

Her back is to him She is motionless

ISHMAEL
Dont you owe me that

And she turns Her eyes go first to her sleeping child Then
she

walks over and sinks to the sand Just before him Near enough

to touch

She looks in his eyes And waits

ISHMAEL
Im like a dying person

The words just came out His eyes move over her face His
aching
for her is naked beyond his ability to cope

ISHMAEL
I dont sleep I tell myself this
cant go on but it goes on anyway

He seems at the edge of insanity Or tears

HATSUE
I did a terrible thing Ishmael
I knew what you felt And what I
didnt

Sadness in her voice But strength as well

HATSUE
And I never found the courage to
tell you
His eyes swim with tears He chokes them back he has to

ISHMAEL
Youll think this is crazy but all
I want is to hold you Just once
And smell your hair

She absorbs this No sign of repulsion or anger Her eyes seem
wise And very sad

HATSUE
You have to hear this I can
never touch you Ishmael Not
once not ever Theres no half-
way As much as I know it hurts
you you have to let this go

ISHMAEL
Look I want to forget you I do
I think if you hold me just this
once I can walk away and never
speak to you again

She just keeps looking at him There is a bravery to her steady
gaze Her calm resolve

ISHMAEL
Please As one human being to
another just because Im miserable
and dont know where to turn I
need to be in your arms If its
just for thirty seconds

His pleading look holds her for a moment In the silence

HATSUE
I hurt for you Whether youll
ever believe that or not

Feeling behind her eyes First time she lets it show

HATSUE
I feel sick sometimes with the
guilt of what Ive done to you
And I cant make it right

She rises slowly Brushes the sand from her skirt

HATSUE
To hold you would be wrong and
deceitful Youre going to have
to live without holding me that
is the truth of the way things are

She takes one step back

HATSUE
Things end They do Get on
with your life

And turns away She gathers her baby in her arms Takes her
blanket her umbrella her rake and her pail He watches never
moving as she gathers her things Gathers them as if he wasnt
there And with her back turned

HATSUE
Get on with your life

She walks slowly away Her baby cries

code of fairness and self-reliance is written on the fine-boned
features

ISHMAEL (V0O)
I drove from the lighthouse to
my mothers place I brought
her some groceries

Beyond the window snow falls more heavily than ever Silent

Spellbinding
HELEN
Your father thought that heavy snow
was Gods kindness Despite the

hardship it brought us beauty
Ishmael at the rustic table Watching her back
HELEN
and reminded us Of our place

in things

Softer Not bitter but regretful that
HELEN
You dont believe in God anymore

ISHMAEL
Agnostics dont believe or disbelieve
Ma We just dont pretend we know

She begins ladling the soup into big porcelain bowls

HELEN
We dont know God we feel Him You
felt Him as a child I remember

And turns Looks at him

ISHMAEL
Thats a long time ago What a
child feelsthats different

She studies him silently for a moment Then brings the bowls to
the table

HELEN
Spend the night will you Dont
go back out into all that snow

Sets them down

ISHMAEL (V0O)
I felt Milhollands report in my
pocket And wondered why I wasnt
telling her Telling someone
What Id found

HELEN
Youve been busy with that trial
I suppose Such a travesty

She takes her seat As he watches her

HELEN
They only arrested that poor soul
because hes Japanese

ISHMAEL
Seattle boys think hes guilty They
say the evidence is rock solid

She begins to eat Eyes on her bowl

HELEN
Theyre not his neighbor like
you are He is a husband a father
he risked his life for their country
The same as you

ISHMAEL
Those arent the facts that matter

She looks up Straight to his eyes

HELEN
Well folks are pretty cold
And folks who believe in nothing
elsetheyre cold too

No mistaking her meaning He swallows Uneasy as always in the
path of her disapproval

HELEN
Ive tried to understand your
unhappiness all these years
Having gone to war losing your arm

The directness of her gaze He cant turn from that

HELEN
But other boys came back And
pushed on They found girls and
married had babies

He doesnt flinch His voice too quiet with

ISHMAEL
Someday Ill get lucky too

Too quiet to conceal the hurt She thinks it is hurt she has
caused It changes her tone to a plea

HELEN
Your father fought at Belleau
Wood it took him years to get
over it Nightmares tears b

ISHMAEL
but he found you

Their eyes locked

HELEN
It isnt the war Ishmael All
those years growing up You never
had a real girl of your own
And now he looks down He sees that his fist is tight around the

handle of his spoon

HELEN
And I know you have it in you
to love I know that much I
wish I knew more

His fingers open and the spoon clatters softly on the wood

ISHMAEL
Ill stay tonight Thanks
for asking

all sign of life

months Until my father passed

Ishmael at 24 the left sleeve of his dark suit of mourning
pinned

at the elbow The diggers are filling a grave in distance

Mourners mingle some casting glances back at Ishmael Keeping

their distance out of awkwardness rationalized as respect

One man comes to him MASATO NAGAISHI is aging and frail But

his
voice is clear
NAGAISHI
The Japanese people of the island
are saddened by this loss Your
father was a man of great fairness
and compassion for others
He stands at a respectful distance Ishmael clears his throat
He

nods thank you No words to say So the small man adds

NAGAISHI
A friend to us And to all people

Silence They are a tableau of stone Finally
ISHMAEL
Well

And no more The man takes a step back

NAGAISHI
We know you will follow in his
footsteps And honor his legacy

Which changes Ishmaels face To something harder

ISHMAEL (V0O)
I thought it then And often since
A balance hes said Finding the
facts That folks needed to know

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Ishmael stands at an open closet Cardboard boxes have been set
aside One has been searched for treasure The page is in his
hand Only slightly discolored by age

HATSUE (VO)
Dear Ishmael These things are
very difficult to say I cant
think of anything more painful
than writing this letter

He closes his eyes

ISHMAEL (a murmur)
Think of reading it

HATSUE (VO)
I dont love you Ishmael There
is no more honest way to say it

He carries the letter to the twin bed Where he slept alone
Thinking of her

HATSUE (VO)
Whenever we were together I knew
it I loved you and I didnt love
you at the same moment

He sinks slowly As if beneath the letters weight

HATSUE (VO)
The last time At the cedar tree
I knew we could never be right
together And that soon I would
have to tell you
His eyes are dry The letter has used up his tears long ago

HATSUE (VO)
This is the last time I will write
to you I am not yours anymore

He sets the letter on the bed beside him

HATSUE (VO)
I wish you the very best Your
heart is large and you are gentle
and kind I know you will do great
things in the world

He reaches now to his inside coat pocket Withdrawing

HATSUE (VO)
I must say good-bye to you now
Our lives will move on The best
we can

-a page Folded in quarters Sets it near the letter

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Milhollands report was like her
letter Something no one else
Would ever read

He stares at them Side by side

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Thing about having only one hand
Its hard to tear pages up And
I wasnt carrying a match

He lies back Across the bed

ISHMAEL (V0O)
So I thought of my father The man
who would have taken this report to
Judge Fielding

Tears stand in his eyes
ISHMAEL (V0O)
But every reporter Chooses his own

balance FInds the facts that matter

Shuts the eyes Against them Against everything
ISHMAEL (V0O)
After all the freighter was only
a theory It proved nothing at
all There were other facts
That mattered

We CLOSE on his face The tightness of the muscles

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Tomorrow I would write a column
About prejudice And she would
be grateful For my largeand
gentleheart

The eyes open they are blank Staring

ISHMAEL (V0O)
Her husband would be judged And
she would be alone

at the future

Nels considers that

Well in the week that followed
the week before Carls death
did your husband pursue him
HATSUE
No Kabuo did not wish to beg
he respected Carls right to
reflect He was sure Carl would
do the honorable thing

NELS (right back)
And did he

She nods Only once Her eyes bright

HATSUE
The night of the 15th Kabuo helped
Carl at sea With his dead battery

Nels raises his eyebrows To give the point its weight

HATSUE
Right there on the boat they
agreed 8400 for the seven acres
800 down They shook on it Kabuo
was so excited when he came home

Nels lets that sit And sit

NELS
And when did you first learn
That Carl had drowned

The slightest pause As if hesitant to confess

HATSUE
One oclock that afternoon from
a clerk at Petersens

NELS (turning to Hooks)
Your witness

And Alvin Hooks rises Perches on the edge of the prosecutors
table And looks at the witness with fairness and suspicion

HOOKS
Your husband came home agitated
after his encounter with the
deceased

No impatience across her perfect features Only earnestness
will do

HATSUE
I said excited Not agitated
he was excited in the sense of
being overjoyed

HOOKS
You wereoverjoyed yourself to
hear the news

HATSUE
Happy for him And relieved

HOOKS
So then youand your husband
must have called friends relatives
to tell them the amazing news Yes

HATSUE (calm respectful)
No

HOOKS
Really Didnt call your mother
your sisters about starting a new
life Your husband never tells
his brothers that the family honor
is vindicated

Hatsue shifts in her chair Smooths her skirt

HATSUE
We hear how Carlpassed away
Only a few hours later

HOOKS
Your husband returned at what
seven oclock

HATSUE
Closer to eight

HOOKS
So five hours Plenty of time for
a call He was excited you say
In the sense of being overjoyed

She nods he was

HATSUE
We arecautious people You
would say conservative There
would be time for celebrating
with others when a paper was signed

Hooks pouts He allows himself that
HOOKS
You thought the deceased might
break his promise

HATSUE
Of course not Were just not
quick to run and boast In case
something went wrong

HOOKS
And then something did Carl
Heine was found dead With his
head crushed

She weathers that last part As if taking no notice

HATSUE
Yes and then what was there
to call about Everything was
up in the air

HOOKS
Up in the air Was that your
reaction

And he rises Tastefully indignant

HOOKS
I would suggest that more happened
than a land sale evaporating A
man died Mrs Miyamoto A husband
and father of small children had
his skull bashed in

HATSUE (quiet dignity)
If you mean to imply that we were
callous about Carls death that is
wrong and insulting

HOOKS
I see Well did you come
forward to tell Sheriff Moran
what you knew The encounter in
the fog thedead battery was it

Silence

HATSUE
We discussed that And decided
not to
HOOKS
Why not

She looks at him with the directness weve seen before

HATSUE
Because the facts could be
misconstrued as murder

HOOKS
But if truth was on your side
whatever were you worried about

Her eyes cut to Nels He smiles to blunt the harm shes done by
looking to him for support Her gaze goes down now And then

-back up Straight to Hooks

HATSUE
Trials arent only about truth
Mr Hooks Even though they
should be Theyre about what
people believe is true

HOOKS
So you hid the truth Deliberately

HATSUE
We were afraid Silence seemed
better To come forward seemed
like a mistake

HOOKS
Well it seems to me

NELS (gently)
Objection Mr Hooks can give
his view in his summation

HOOKS
Doesnt it seem to you Mrs
Miyamoto that your mistake was
in being deceitful Concealing
information during the course of
a sheriffs investigation

HATSUE
It seems human To me

Oh Hooks raises his brows

HOOKS
for

of

I suppose that you mean this excuses
concealing the truth Then why
ahouls any of us believe you now

And in the silence

HOOKS
Question withdrawn you may
step down

HATSUE
Youre implying th

HOOKS
I said No further questions

Anger flashes across her eyes Her face colors She draws a
breath

JUDGE
Thats enough Mrs Miyamoto not
another word Step down please

She looks to Nels in her desperation and regret for making things
worse he chuckles and waves Its quite all right She sits

a frozen moment And as she rises

The boys in the reporters row are scribbling furiously
All but one

INT COURTROOM - DAY

JOSIAH GILLANDERS folds his blunt thick hands across his belly
Nearly 50 sporting a walrus moustache and the watery dull eyes

an alcoholic he is a man ready to make the most of his fifteen
minutes of fame

NELS (0S)
Thirty years fishing alone Ever
had an occasion to board another
mans boat except in an emergency
Maybe to socialize or some such

GILLANDERS (ready for this)
Never Only boarded some fellas boat
five six times in thirty-one years
Dead engine broken hip only in need

NELS (0S)
Now Mister Gi

GILLANDERS
Unwritten rule of the sea We dont
bother each other stick to ourselves
Ask anybody

Nels is wandering over to the jury box

NELS
Now if you wanted to kill a man
Think youd try boarding against
his will and hitting him with a
fishing gaff

GILLANDERS
Its a joke Maneuver up to Carls
boat Tie your lines fast Come
aboard All against Carls will
Its the stupidest suggestion I
ever heard of

NELS
Im sorry about that It wasnt
mine in the first place

Gentle laughter Even some on the jury

NELS
So the fishing gaff method wouldnt
make sense

GILLANDERS
Couldnt get on the boat Id
just shoot the feller Then tie
up throw him inta th drink And
skip bein the first gill-netter
in history to make a successful
forced boarding

More laughter Hooks at his table Simply smiles

NELS
Now the sheriff believed that the
D-6 battery in Carls well was
Carls own spare Even though it
was too large f

GILLANDERS
No sense to have any at all
even the right size Its like
having an extra battery in the
trunk of your car Nobody does

Nobody No way

GILLANDERS
Boat has two batteries

NELS

Lose one
you run off the other til morning
Carl musta lost both so Miyamoto
there gave him one a his

Course if Carl lost both batteries
dead in the water his radio wouldnt
work So how would he signal for help

GILLANDERS

Compressed air horn most likely
Hope to God some man hears you in

that fog

NELS

All right what if the defendant

heard So Carl let him aboard

help And then the fishing gaff

Gillanders grins Wide

GILLANDERS

You mean Miyamoto followed him out

there and sucker-punched him

NELS
Well what if

GILLANDERS

Now how is Miyamoto gonna know

in advance That Carl loses two
batteries Must happen once ever

20 years or so
Another chuckle or two from the gallery

NELS

Thank you Mr Gillanders
you for coming down in this cold

weather

GILLANDERS

Well it does seem mighty warm in

here Specially for Mr

And looks at the prosecutor Who rises

Hooks

easily

Thank

A most polite
fuck-you smile Hooks strolls now Slow and steady
to

Straight

the witness box Rests his hands on the rail leans in

HOOKS
What if the defendant follows Carl
And pretends his own batteries are
dead Would Carl tie up and help

And the smile on Gillanders face Stops Cold

HOOKS
Is the word youre groping
foryes perha

JUDGE (0S)
Alvin

HOOKS
Rephrase Do you agree that he
might tie up to the defendants bo

GILLANDERS
So whys the D-6 in Carls well

HOOKS
Whos to say Maybe it was just
a spare after all Or maybe the
defendant left it as a potential
alibi In case somebody saw him
in Ship Channel Bank

(beat)
In case we put two and two
together knowing of the hostility
Between the families

Gillanders Actually thinking about that
HOOKS
My question is Could Carl have
tied up to help the defendant
A beat A cleared throat
GILLANDERS
It coulda happened And if I start
to say its doubtful youd probly
say no further questions right

Once more laughter Enough to bring the gavel DOWN

HOOKS
Right about that And right that
it coulda happened’

Turns his back walks away

HOOKS
Thanks for your help Hope the
witness box wasnt too warm for
your comfort

All eyes follow the prosecutor as he sits Except for the
defendant His stare forward Recalling

INT KABUOS CELL - NIGHT

Kabuo seated on the concrete floor of his cell leaning back
against the wall Leaving the cot For his guest

NELS
But the toughest scenario Is the
one Hooks will never raise

Kabuo watching Quiet Takes a breath

KABUO
And whats that

NELS
That you came upon Carl by accident
Like you said Gave him the battery
Like you said Asked him about the
seven acres Like you said

The hardest Straightest Look

NELS
Only He said no

Silence

NELS
And somethinghappened That
youd never planned Because
youre not a cold-blooded killer

Nobody flinches Nobody blinks
KABUO
Im more a hot-blooded killer huh

Like a soldier Like a samurai

NELS
You wont hear that from Hooks
Because the charge is first-degree
murder which requires premeditation
He cant change the charge

Do you understand

NELS
So if the jury thinks you did kill
but only in the heat of anger They
have to acquit

Do you

NELS
And you couldnt Be Re-tried

Kabuos face is stone A warriors mask

KABUO
You want me to say that

NELS
I want you To tell the truth

There is no kindly smile tonight No candy bars

KABUO
You think that is the truth

NELS
I told your wife Trials arent
always so much about actual truth
As about what folks believe is true
Thats sad And its real

KABUO
And what do you believe

Nels sighs Cocks his head just to one side
NELS
A question first Why do you want
to know

KABUO (straight back)
Because youre my friend

The old man thinks about that Studies his client

NELS
I believe you are a good man Who
mist

belongs with his family
And then the feeling comes To the watery eyes

NELS
And I believe You didnt do it

EXT SHIP CHANNEL BANK - NIGHT
Fog The sound of water Lapping at the hull of a boat The
drfits revealing

Eyes They are blue The heavy brows above them dark gold

matted

and damp

CARL (0S)
My batteries are drawed down both
of em ALternator belts were loose

PULL BACK to see him With his keroses lantern and his air horn

KABUO (0S)
No sweat Well pull one a mine
get ya started

PULL BACK to see him now leaning on his gaff Squinting up At
the top of Carls mast We follow his gaze to see

KABUO (0S)
You lashed up a lantern Gainst
a fog like this

See it now SWAYING as the helpless boat bobs in the night

CARL (0S)
Lantern and a air horn Thats
all I got without my juice

INT CARLS CABIN - LATER

CLOSE on a battery well One battery sits in place one spot is
empty And

CRASH The butt end of a fishing gaff BANGS against the metal
flange Again Again AGAIN And as the next blow is STRUCK
the huge hand

Slips and the soft metal SLICES Carls flesh across his palm
He stops Then SMASHES away twice more We PULL BACK to see
two batteries lie above the well Carl sucks the blood from
his
cut Then lifts Kabuos D-6 into place

CARL
Dont know how long its take to
get a charge

KABUO
Keep it tonight Well catch fish
Ill see ya back on the docks

Kabuo takes his gaff Heedless of Carls blood on the butt end
Carl looks up still crouching above his well

CARL (quietly)
Hold on You know as well as
I do we got somethin to talk
about

No response from Kabuo He stands above the larger man Silent
neutral Waiting

CARL
Seven acres Im wonderin’ what
youd pay for em Just curious
is all

KABUO
What are you sellin em for
Why dont we start there

Which makes the big man smile Just a little

CARL
Did I say I was selling But
if I was Id have to figure you
want em real bad Oughta charge
a sall fortune maybe

A slight shrug Of giant shoulders

CARL
Then again Maybe youd want
your battery back

Kabuo doesnt grin back His face shows nothing at all

KABUO
The batterys in thats done
with Besides youd do the
same form
CARL
might do the same I have to
warn you ‘bout that chief Im
not screwed together like I used
to be

Kabuos face remains impassive Patient And the big man

squints

up into it Holding a handkerchief to his injured hand

CARL
Hell Im sorry okay About
the whole damn mess If Ida
been around my mother wouldnt
a pulled it off that way

He is sorry And with that Kabuos face eases Becomes like

Carls own

Still no smile

Carl laughs And Kabuo chuckles right along with him

CARL (grins)
I was out there at sea Fightin
you Jap sons-a-bitches

KABUO (no grin)
Im an American Did I call you
a Nazi you big Nazi bastard

CARL (softly)
Not that I recall

KABUO
I killed men who looked just like
you pig-fed German bastards And
their blood dont wash off so easy

Carl staring up

KABUO
So dont talk to me about Japs
you big Nazi son of a bitch

kept his poker face the longer

CARL
I ama bastard Ima big Hun
Nazi son of a bitch And I still
got your bamboo fishing rod

KABUO
Oh yeh

Having
CARL

Hid it from my mom
Damn things still in

a sea runs

KABUO

You can have it

The look between them now

Is very wonderful

Caught a mess

(very softly)
The hell with it

In the subtlety

of
its connection
CARL
1200 an acre thats what I paid
Ole wont take a dime less You
got no choice on that
KABUO
Didnt say I was buyin did I
What you want down Just bein
curious is all
The handkerchief comes away from Carls palm And rising his
hand
extends toward the smaller man
CARL
A thousand down Well sign
papers tmorrow
The hands grip And they hold And the length of this clasp
and
the straightness of their gaze and the silence of the moment
Wash years away

Eight hundred And its a deal
INT COURTROOM - DAY
CLOSE on eyes They are Asian Unblinking
HOOKS (0S)
For the life of me sir I cannot
imagine why you kept this story from
the sheriff
PULL BACK to see Kabuo in the witness box Ramrod straight
Face

composed
KABUO
As my wife testified we were
considering it

HOOKS
Actually she said you had decided
Decided not not come forward

KABUO (quietly)
I was thinking about it Every
minute

HOOKS
Except even when Sheriff Moran
arrested you You said nothing
about seeing Carl

Turns to the jury Openly bewildered

HOOKS
At that point you were already
under suspicion The battery story
explained things If the story was
trueand not simply something you
thought up later

Turns back To the defendant

HOOKS
Why Didnt you Tell it

No reaction from the defendant Nothing anyone can see

KABUO
Sheriff said right off I was
under suspicion I didnt have
a lawyer

HOOKS
But even after you had an
attorney You still claimed to
know nothing Claimed not to
have seen Carl Am I correct

A beat

KABUO
Yes Initially

HOOKS
Well initially is an interesting
word sir Youd been arrested
you had a lawyer and you still
claimed ignorance

Silence

KABUO
I should have told everything
right away I know that now
and I regret it

HOOKS
Should have told everything
Meaning you should have told
the truth

We can just discern the anger At the edge of Kabuos steady
gaze
Silence

HOOKS
Nothing to say

KABUO (quietly)
I didnt know that was a question
It sounded like a speech

And Hooks smiles Loving it Walks toward the witness stalking
him

HOOKS
My apologies Do you regret
not telling the truth

KABUO
I have told the truth

HOOKS
You mean this morning The
new story the battery story
That one is the truth Thats
a question sir

KABUO (even quieter)
Yes And I told it long before
this morning

HOOKS
I see Now what happened the
day Carl Heine was found Before
your arrest

KABUO
I slept til one-thirty when my
wife woke me up with the news We
talked for a few hours I left at
six and went straight to my boat

HOOKS
Didnt go anywhere else No errands
no purchases Just straight to the
boat Thats the truth

KABUO
Yes

Hooks leans over the box Ever so slightly invading Kabuos
space

HOOKS
Well the sheriff found two batteries
in your well If you left one with

Carl Heine how is that possible

KABUO
I had a spare battery in my shed
I brought it down and put it in
just before the sheriff showed up

Ah I see

HOOKS
Conveniently in your shed Only
you didnt mention that a moment ago
Why does this battery story change
every time a new question is raised

Kabuo looks at him evenly

KABUO
You asked if I went straight to the
boat I did With the battery

Hooks steps back Looks the witness over

HOOKS
Youre a hard man to trust sir
You sit before us with no expression
keeping a poker f

NELS (0S)
Objection

JUDGE
You know better than that Mr
Hooks Either ask questions
that count for something or sit
down and be done with it

Silence The judge staring hard Hooks never flinching

JUDGE
Shame on you

Hooks turns his eyes to Kabuo Stares him down so the jury can
watch Kabuos implacable stare in return And softly

HOOKS
I apologize to the court for
letting my feelings get the
better of me

Turns away
HOOKS
No other questions Well go to

summation

As he returns to his table As Kabuo steps down from the box
We PAN

creporters row The boys are writing as fast as their hands

oe move Only Ishmael is not writing at all He stares at the pad
resting on hsi right knee We CLOSE to see
One word circled The word lantern
INT COURTROOM - LATER
Alvin Hooks stalks the jury box now Prowls before them along
the

rail As their eyes follow

HOOKS
believing that Etta Heines son
would never sell him the land Land
that in his mind filtered through
ancient rules of behavior handed down
from his ancestors culture belonged
to his family by right

Stops To make sure they understand

HOOKS
His only choice to get the land
would be to eliminate Carl Heine

So that Ole Jurgensen would need
a new buyer

Pacing again hand trailing along the rail

HOOKS
In his mind Seen through codes
of revenge difficult for us to
fathom this was also the only way
to avenge what he felt to be the
grievous dishonor brought to his
father his family

Raises his finger This must be heard

HOOKS
to a thousand years of ancestry
in a foreign land we still find an
enigma Despite our recent bitter
experience with its ways

And stops once more Places his hands on the rail

Straightens up

HOOKS
Thus believing cold-blooded murder to
be justifiedhe trailed Carl Heine
could hear his engine in the fogand
sounded his own horn claiming distress

Shakes his head ever so slightly

HOOKS
As Carl pulled alongside Please
Carl the defendant must have said
I am sorry for what has come between
us but adrift here in the fog I
plead for your help

Imagine Imagine that

HOOKS
And so this good man tied his
boat fast while his enemy leaps
aboard striking the treacherous
blow he was trained to strike by
his fathers hand

Counting off the facts One finger at a time

HOOKS
The feud over these seven acres
had festered for eight years He
argued with Carl about buying the

land one week before Carl was killed
Carls skull was crushed and his
blood is on a murder weapon with which
the defendant is a deadly expert

Spreads his arms Wide

HOOKS
And after a series of lies The
defendant at last admits he was
there Alone on the boat In
the fog Carl Heines blood on
his fishing gaff

A hush A murmur

HOOKS
My lord My lord

Looking into the eyes now Of each man Each woman

HOOKS
Look clearly at the defendant
See the truth self-evident in him
And in the facts of this case

And turns So that they will follow his eyes to Kabuos stone-
hard gaze

HOOKS
Look into his eyes ladies and
gentlemen consider his face
And ask yourself what your duty
is as citizens of this community

INT COURTROOM - LATER
PAN the jury slowly as they hear

NELS (0S)
not a single witness has testified
to anything that could suggest pre-
meditated murder Not in the days
before Carl Heines deathor at
any timehas anyone described a
murderous rage toward the deceased

Nels stands very still Hands resting on the rail As calm and
quiet as his adversary had been dramatic

NELS
As

Etta Heine had cheated his family
He had asked his childhood friend
Carl to sell him the land And
Carl was considering it

Leans forward Just a little

NELS
There is no evidence of anger at
Carl much less rage much less
murderous rage No reason for
premeditation and no evidence of
it Anywhere

He picks out a housewife The youngest Smiles sadly wisely
her grandfather might

NELS
And yet the state is required to
prove these things Beyond A
reasonable Doubt

His eyes widen

NELS
Can you seriously think there is
no reasonable doubt Why is Kabuos
D-6 battery in Carls well if Carl
was helping him

Why

NELS
Why isnt the blood on the gaff
more consistent with Carls hand
wound than a skull fracture Given
the absence of bone or brain tissue

And now he begins to pace limping slightly eyes down

NELS
What Mr Hooks asks you to believe
is that no proof is needed Against
a man who bombed Pearl Harbor

Slow Eyes on his feet

NELS
Look at his face the prosecutor said
Presuming that you will see an enemy
there Treacherous by nature by a
thousand years of something or other
He stops Looks at them

NELS
An argument I find as despicable as
it is dishonest and twisted and
insulting to us all Mr Miyamoto
is a much-decorated hero of the United
States Army For Gods sake

The feeling wells in te old man It bleeds through the very
quietness of his voice

NELS
If someone said you should convict
Carl Heine Or his lovely widow
Of murder Without proof Because
their ancestry is the same as
Hitlers You would spit in his eye

Yes you would

NELS
And every decent American Would
applaud you

He leans his elbows on their rail As if confiding to them
across
their backyard fence

NELS
Now Kabuo Miyamoto did one thing
wrong He was afraid to trust us
at first Afraid that he would be
crucified by prejudice As Mr Hooks
is urging you to do

Silence

NELS
Well we sent him And his wife
And thousands of Americans to
concentration camps They lost
homes belongings everything
We did that folks Can we now be
unforgiving about his uncertainty
His mistrust

Looking in their eyes As if waiting for an answer They shift
their weight fidget beneath his gaze
NELS
You may think this is a small trial
In a small place Well it isnt

He straightens his spine Winces slightly with the pain of it

NELS
Every once in awhile Somewhere
in the world Humanity goes on
trial And integrity And decency
Every once in awhile common folks
get called on to give the report
card for the human race

The eyes are watering But the voice gains strength

NELS
Now here in America We relish
those chances Give us that one
we say Thats why we built this
country in the first place

One step back Just above a whisper

NELS
Be Americans Make your
children proud

Well please break them then
I wont keep you a moment

And she reaches past him To take her husbands hands She
looks
in his eyes as if they are alone

HATSUE
I love you And tomorrow when
I make our bed Im setting out
your pillow

Tears just flood her eyes Sudden unbidden She holds tight to
her smile And to his hands

HATSUE (whispers)
You better be there

He smiles A lovely easy cowboy-American smile

KABUO
Only if you ask me nice

ANGLEfrom the gallery One man watches Watches as a woman
brings manicled hands to her lips And walks quickly away

toward us Straight toward us in fact And when she stands

before us her hands mangle her purse The eyes are hollow
flint-

edged

I did But the jury wont s

Please sit down

But the tall man doesnt Doesnt move
KABUO
She told me youre writing a

Ishmael nods awkwardly Acknowledging this

KABUO

She Said you two go way back

Ishmael stares into Kabuos earnest smile

KABUO
Thats nice

ISHMAEL
You said there was a lantern
in his hand When you found
him in the fog

Only

Kabuo blinks The mans tone is formal As if the offer of

friendliness is somehow rejected

ISHMAEL
And another one Lashed to
the mast

Kabuos own smile has faded The mask has returned

KABUO
Thats right

ISHMAEL
Two Lanterns

And Kabuo grins In spite of himself

wondering about

INT SOMMENSENS WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Blackness The sound of wind Of water lapping at wood CLICK
of

a key springing a lock The SCRAPE of a large PADLOCK sliding

away A door CREAKS open and from the sound of it a large one

Gray light seeps in

MORAN (0S)
Blackmail Thats all it is

See them now Three SILHOUETTES framed in thr barns open
doorway

Against the night sky

ISHMAEL (0S)
I call it keeping your promise
We said if I ever needed some
cooperation from you

A soft CLICK and the LIGHTS go on Such as they are A few
bare bulbs strung across the rafters of this towering ramshackle
enclosure A 50-year-old mildewed barn built of creosoted
timbers This is a place for overhauling boats with sea doors
facing the harbor

Two BOATS are tied to wide-elbowed piers Weve seen them
before

MORAN
You threatened me Chambers pure
and simple And what idiots gonna
believe some cock and bull story
that I made a deal to keep stuff
outta your paper Not that anybody
reads your paper

Abel Martenson leads the way Along soaking planks

ISHMAEL
Same idiots wholl believe you
cracked this case When I tell
em you did

Moran snorts Points up to the cross spar high on the mast of
the
first boat
MORAN
See no lantern

ABEL (respectfully)
Sheriff Thats Miyamotos boat

Oh Moran swings his gaze up to the second boat

MORAN (quiet triumph)
No lantern there neither

Sure enough No lantern on the cross spar They keep walking

MORAN
Never shoulda given you that
inventory in the first place

ISHMAEL
Its public record If the public
cares enough to read it

They step across the gunnel Onto Carl Heines boat
Flashlights

working against the dim eerie glow of distant bulbs they enter
Carls cabin

Neat as a pin Ishmael scans the floor

ISHMAEL
You said there was a coffee c

ABEL (sorry)
I picked it up

And points to the cup Sitting on the counter

ABEL
Its the only thing I moved I
swear It was right there

The sheriff glares at the boy

MORAN
You wanna see that in the papers
Dont ever touch something at a cri

And stops Because Ishmaels gaze has gone to a kerosene
lantern
In the corner

MORAN
One lantern Like the inventory
says Sorry to disappoint you

But Ishmael is out the door Shining his flashlight Up the
mast

ISHMAEL
Actually I was hoping you got
it right Whats that up there

And they all squint up Shining their lights together Along
the

cross spar

MORAN
Nothin Bits of string

Thats what it looks like Many of them

ISHMAEL
Pieces of twine arent nothing

And he steps to the base of the mast Puts the flashlight in his
pocket Wraps his arm around the shaft of wood

MORAN
Here now what are you fixin
to do

ISHMAEL

Have a look At nothing
And wrapping his legs around the mast he hoists himself up

MORAN
You cant go up there touch things

With all his strength Ishmael begins to climb
ISHMAEL (grunting)
Trials over Sheriff its with
the jury now

Supporting himself with his legs he struggles upward

MORAN
You gonna climb that with one arm

ISHMAEL
Youre right I better use two

Up he goes inching his way Abel shining his flashlight Moran
swings his beam up too
ABEL
Theres lots of em Art look

And Moran is looking Saying nothing Now Ishmael is there

ISHMAEL
A dozen or more all figure eights
All cut clean through on an angle

ABEL
And look at that streak of rust
across the mast

His light playing on it Bracing his full weight with his legs
Ishmael fingers the scraps of rope

ISHMAEL
Its on the twine too But its
not r

MORAN

Dont prove there was two lanterns
Coulda been the one in the cabin

Still supporting himself with his legs Ishmael pulls out his
flashlight

ISHMAEL
Theres a stretch of ground
between guessin and provin
Sheriff Ill give you that

Shines it DOWN on the deck Along the gunnel Just below the
mast And as we watch the circle of light move

MORAN (0S)
What do you think youre lookin
at now

Still moving And in the silence an absent
ISHMAEL (0S)
Not what Im looking at Its
what Im looking for

INT JURY ROOM - NIGHT

Eleven citizens around a walnut table Eleven Glaring at the
twelfth

ALEXANDER VAN NESS
Well I guess it comes down to

a feeling dont it If I feel
uncertain I feel a doubt Isnt
that it

And the boat builder smiles amicably rubs his gray beard
other smiles Anywhere

HAROLD JENSEN
Alex nobody aint ever sure about
nothin Its unreasonable to be so
stubborn that you think youre smarter
than eleven folks who all agree

EDITH TWARDZIK
The man sat there and admitted he
lied Mr Van Ness Now why isnt
that enough for you

ALEXANDER VAN NESS
Were not tryin him for lying Lots
of us told lies one time or another
Probly none of us murdered anybody

HAROLD JENSEN
But what drives a man to lie
Means hes hiding somethin’

ALEXANDER VAN NESS
Not necessarily that he killed
Carl Im not sayin youre wrong
just that I have my doubts

BURKE LATHAM
Look if you changed chairs right
now cos you doubted that maybe a
chunk of the moon was gonna fall
through the roof that wouldnt be
a reasonable doubt

Folks turn to Burke What the hell are you talking about

ALEXANDER VAN NESS (laughs)
Okay you win that one Now can
we all go to bed

HARLAN McQUEEN
The mooring line Doesnt that
tell you something

ALEXANDER VAN NESS
I think it does Miyamoto was on
Carls boat or vice-versa Not
much doubt about th

MARLAN McQUEEN
And Carls blood on the gaff

ALEXANDER VAN NESS
Theres a chance it came from his
hand

BURKE LATHAM
Theres a chance of everything
But you add a chance from here and
a chance from there the world aint
made a coincidences only

Everyone agrees Almost everyone

EDITH TWARDZIK
Look if he gave Carl a battery
like he said hed only a had one
left Not two

ALEXANDER VAN NESS
He explained that He replaced it

HARLAN McQUEEN
Only he threw that part in when he
got cornered But first time around
he never mentioned it

ROGER PORTER
Alex stop arguin just to argue
You can see what really happened
same as us Isnt that what were
supposed to do is tell the actual
truth My God Carl died here

ALEXANDER VAN NESS
So I dont care Carl died unless
Im ready to reach for the hangmans
rope You oughta stop tryin to
bully me into hurrying

Little anger in that It brings a silence
BURKE LATHAM
Been six hours You sayin theres

a way to go slower

INT NELS KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT
Nels in a ratty frayed old robe pouring hot water from a kettle

into mismatched cups His hair is wispy and wild his eyes
puffy

He COUGHS horrible CLEARS his throat

NELS
Well Its imaginative

And drops tea bags into the cups with a splash

NELS
Ill give you that

Lisps over to the cluttered table Where his guest is waiting

ISHMAEL
Its the way it happened I know
it is

NELS

No you dont
Nels sits Slowly Ishmael removes his bag Sips his tea

NELS
That report About the freighter
You didnt find that tonight did you

No answer Ishmael keeps sipping Holding eye contact

NELS

You went right to the cell Then
to the boat Then here How long
did you know about the freighter

ISHMAEL (just above a whisper)
One day

Nels turn To sip his tea

NELS
This tastes horrible hmmn

ISHMAEL
Youre wondering why I held it

NELS
Im wondering how the judge is
gonna like my waking up his old
bones in the middle of the night

And he smiles A wonderful smile
we

Another sip

NELS
Your daddy Was quite a feller

ISHMAEL
Yes he was

NELS
Hes looking down And hes not
thinking bout the man you were
yesterday Hes proud of the man

you are tonight Thats what counts

ISHMAEL
To my father Everything counts

Nels watches the pain in that

NELS
What if I told you he once said
to medont matter the road we
take Just so we get there

ISHMAEL (smiles)
Then youd be lying

NELS
Doesnt make me wrong

INT COURTROOM - DAY

The jury once more in the jury box PAN their faces

saw last night

Edith Twardzik

NELS (0S)
All right lets say that twine
had been there to lash a lantern
That it had come from the shuttle of

twine found in the deceaseds pocket

Burke Latham Alexander Van Ness

NELS (0S)
Now to re-open a trial that had
gone to jurynew evidence should
be pretty important

See Ishmael Quiet intense On the witness stand

The faces
NELS (0S)
Tell us why that lantern would be
so significant

ISHMAEL
Well It shows the prosecutor was
wrong It was Carls boat that was
dead in the water Or hed never
have put up the lantern

Nels thinks about that So the jury will too

A slight shurg

And then

Nels smiles his

NELS
Now you believe there were two
lanterns when defendant arrived
One in Carls hand The second
lashed to the mast

ISHMAEL
Thats what Mr Miyamoto reported
and hed have no reason to lie
He couldnt know that it would help
his case

NELS
Well why does it

ISHMAEL
Because the second lantern the one
on the mast Was never found So
we have to ask

Stating the obvious

ISHMAEL
where did it go

ISHMAEL
Maybe it went Where Carl went
Over the side

HOOKS
Objection Speculation

grandfather smile

NELS
Your Honor all of this is
speculation Including Mr Hooks
dramaturgy about the defendant
issuing a false distress call

HOOKS
Tht was summation Your H

JUDGE (gently)
Overruled Alvin Lets hear
this hmmn

Nels Gudmundsson nods to himself Takes a stroll over to the
jury
box No limp today Something has put some spring in his step

NELS
So how does this fit with what
you told us at the start The
freighter that plowed through
Ship Channel Bank

And turns Leaning his scrawny butt against the jurys rail
Hell watch this with them now

ISHMAEL
Thats when he fell

NELS
Fell

Ishmael settles in Here we go

ISHMAEL
Miyamoto gave him the battery and
left Carls boat was running he
goes back to fishing But at some
point he thinks of the lantern

NELS
Still lashed to the mast

ISHMAEL
He figures a perfectly good
lantern could get banged around
up there So he climbs up To
cut it down

NELS
Just as the freighter comes through
Isnt that quite a coincidence

ISHMAEL
Coincidences happen You run a
yellow light just as a car comes
out of nowhere Split-second tragedy
happens every day Or maybe

NELS
Maybe

ISHMAEL
Maybe Carl picks up something about
the freighter on his radio which is
now working Same report Milholland
heard And that makes him get the
lantern fast Before the freighters
wake can bang it around

NELS
But you could be wrong He could
have climbed up earlier

ISHMAEL
Then wheres the lantern And
wheres the knife

NELS
The knife What knife

As if he really has forgotten As if he wants to know

ISHMAEL
Coroner found an empty knife sheath
on Carls belt But they never
found the knife

Hes nodding Yes thats right
ISHMAEL

He climbs up His hand wound still

bleeding Thats the blood I found

on the mast And the twine

Nels eyes are rapt His mouth is shut No way he interrupts

this
roll
ISHMAEL

He cuts the lantern free the
freighters wake hits the boat
rolls hard his bloody hand slips
tracing blood along the mast

A hush

ISHMAEL
He falls The lantern the knife
go into the water Same as Carl

The words hang there
ISHMAEL
And inside the cabin a coffee

cup falls off the counter

Shakes his head

ISHMAEL
But theres no one around To
pick it up
Nels ponders Puts his hand to his chin
NELS
Still a coincidence Timing
and all
ISHMAEL

The freighter started through

at 142 The sea water seeped
into Carls watch and stopped it
At 147

CUT to the defendant Ramrod straight nothing revealed in his
face And to his wife Elegant erect Her eyes flooded with
tears

NELS
Still and all Carl was a strong
swimmer he m

ISHMAEL
He hit his head On the way in

Silence

NELS
You think so

ISHMAEL
The sheriff and the deputy and I
inspected the deck closely We
found a small fracture in the wood
of the gunnel Just below the mast

NELS
Well anything coulda caused that
eyes

here

Ishmael nods

And Nels is wal

small cellophan

Lays the bag on
judge

Turns to the pr

And just stroll
How bout them
he lets a littl

Across the way
almost amused

No smile at all

ISHMAEL
Anything That had a blond hair

king now Toward the prosecutors table Pulling

e bag from hisinside pocket

NELS
Request introduction of Exhibit 18

One single blond hair Which Sheriff
Moran dug out of that fracture Below

the mast Of Carl Heines boat

the table Just in front of Hooks

NELS
We will call Sheriff Moran who
will confirm this And Coroner
Whaley to testify that the damage
to the gunnel is of a size and
nature not inconsistent with the
deceaseds skull fracture

osecutor

NELS
But for now Your witness

Turns to the

s on over to his seat Looks in his clients

apples Kabuo loves this old guy And right

e of that show

the prosector is rising He smiles

HOOKS
I have to start reading your
paper more closely Youre quite
a storyteller

ISHMAEL (straight back)
Thank you Coming from the man who
wrote But here adrift in the fog
I plead for your helpthats quite
a compliment

Friendly
There is a ripple of laughter But no smile on Ishmaels
features

His game face is on Come and get me sucker And Hooks does

come one step at a time Straight to the box

HOOKS
Everything had to happen just
right For your little story to
fly I mean a blond hair could be
on that gunnel for a lot of reasons

ISHMAEL
Im sorry was there a question
in there

No love lost And no pretense about it Hatsue Miyamoto sits
with

her hand in her mothers Watching these men battle for her

husbands life

HOOKS
Well the freighter The twine
The blood The knife The cup
The watch The second battery
The phantom lantern The fishing
gaff The cracked gunnel The
skull wound The blond hair Thats
eleven things

ISHMAEL
Twelve

Hooks smiles

HOOKS
I stand corrected sir And you
have a neat explanation for every
one of them

Hooks nods Yes you do

HOOKS
And since you confess this is
all pure guesswork What is your
expertise sir are you a detective
of sorts

ISHMAEL
My expertise Is that Ima

journalist

Right at his eyes
ISHMAEL
And journalism Is balance Finding
the facts folks need to know

The words ring with quiet heartfelt conviction that others
cannot
fully appreciate

ISHMAEL
Then putting them together So
truth is revealed

HOOKS
But isnt the truth that there are
several other ways to explain each
of these twelve pieces

ISHMAEL
Oh yes

And the prosecutor stops Confused for an instant by this
confession Until

ISHMAEL
But no other way To explain
them all

A heart-stopping hush As everyone as Hooks himself sees the
cehckmate

ISHMAEL
And since they all happened
This is the only explanation
thats the truth

The prosecutor looks like hes been slapped Like every act of
will is necessary to maintain composure To find the easy
untroubled smile

HOOKS
Your line of work You must meet
a lot of men play fast and loose
with the truth

ISHMAEL
Like you couldnt believe

Service returned Hooks leans in

HOOKS
Well the defendant is a liar
Hes confessed that much And his
explanation ishe was afraid

And leans in some more

HOOKS
Afraid that the good folks of
this jury Would be too stupid
to understand Too prejudiced
to be fair

Shakes his head

HOOKS
You buy that

ISHMAEL (gently)
I think he was greedy

And once more The prosecutor can only blink Can only move
toward the trap

HOOKS
Greedy

ISHMAEL
He didnt want to lose any more

No smile No smile as the trap springs shut

ISHMAEL
Hed lost a lot in the war you
see I had sent him away Toa
concentration camp But a nice

one Far less brutal than the Nazis
Because Im a civilized person

He stops Lets Hooks clear his throat

HOOKS
I asked you a question youre writing
a tract h

ISHMAEL
Thats how journalists Answer
questions

Turns to Judge Fielding With all respect
ISHMAEL

May I answer the question Your
Honor Anout the defendants
motivation to lie

JUDGE
I wouldnt miss it for the world
son Now you say you sent the
defendant to Manzanar

ISHMAEL
I didnt say I did it alone

And things get real quiet

ISHMAEL
So there he was His father lost
his health there finally died
They lost more than Etta Heines
seven acres They lost their
liberty their dignity Their
ideals about this country

So much feeling in this He has to stop Swallow hard

ISHMAEL
They lost their trust in us We
had treated them worse than animals
How would we now see tham As human
beings

Tells the jury Straight to their faces

ISHMAEL
This man lost a lot in the war
He didnt want now to lose his
babies Or the woman who loves him

Another level of quiet He turns to the prosecutor

ISHMAEL
And my expertise in this sir Is
that I lost a lot in the war myself

Words coming from someplace very deep

ISHMAEL
And the fact that I am the only
witness Who placed his right hand
upon the Holy Bible Is the least
of it sir I assure you of that

Silence

HOOKS
Well sir I hate to spoil the
soliloquy I truly do But the
fact isyou are not on trial here
Nor is Judge Fielding or myself
Nor the good people of this jury
For events that took place twelve
years ago

No sir
HOOKS
And I wouldnt blame these good
people if they were a mite resent-
ful At a tactic that insults
their intelligence
ISHMAEL
Thats curious I was appealing
to their intelligence
HOOKS
Were you sir Can you prove one
word of all your fancy story
ISHMAEL
No sir I cant Not beyond a
reasonable doubt
And he smiles First time

ISHMAEL
Its fortunate that the man who
needs to prove his fancy story
Beyond a reasonable doubt Is
someone else

There is laughter in the room so welcome is any chance to
relieve
the tension The gavel BANGS

ISHMAEL
Im sorry Mr Hooks I apologize
for my tone This is not a contest
Between you and me

Shakes his head No it isnt

ISHMAEL
For it is not As Mr Gudmundsson
so wisely put it A small trial
In a small place
His eyes are damp now Strangely enough after all this He is

at
last on the brink of losing control Because
ISHMAEL
I lost more in that war than
anyone will ever know So did
a lot of folks And what we got
back in return
His voice breaks slightly But it rings with dignity on
ISHMAEL
was a country Where a man
was innocent Until we proved
him guilty
And the voice drops To just above a whisper
ISHMAEL
Whether we all got cheated
Were about to find out

CLOSE on Hatsue Miyamoto speaking earnestly her eyes down her
purse in her lap her slender hands expressing the intensity of
her
feelings as she makes her point and we
PULL BACK to reveal that she is on a corridor bench surrounded
by
a half dozen REPORTERS who are crouching standing scribbling
away Two PHOTOGRAPHERS pop flashes that she does not seem to
notice as she continues with refined determination and we
PULL BACK down the hallway to the POV of a man who sits alone
unnoticed There is an unopened pack of cigarettes in his only
hand turning absently in long strong fingers that crinkle the
pristine cellophane His eyes are fixed to hatsue holding court
at a distance Fixed as if no other sight could ever command
this
level of attention

All things considered
Hearing the voice Ishmael looks down Uneasy to have been
caught

staring so intently

you were adequate
No smile accompanies the irony For that would be condescending

I could make a few quibbles but
I am loathe to hurt your feelings

The old man sits Very slowly

ISHMAEL

NELS
Ill take two One for later

Ishmael tries to tear the cellophane without success Nels seems
not even to notice

NELS (quietly)
She is simply Beautiful

Ishmaels eyes cut to him A little quickly Confides

ISHMAEL
Ive always thought so

There it sits His fingers claw absently at the cellophane

makes no move to intervene
NELS
If I whistle Those boysll see
you and come runnin Youre
the story today
ISHMAEL
You ever been strangled by a
single hand
NELS
Naw Ive seen what that can do
to a pack of cigarettes
Comfortable together In this hour of discomfort Ishmael
brings
the corner of the pack to his teeth and tears the cellophane
away

ISHMAEL
Better take three
Fingers nimbly shred the seal open the pack

ISHMAEL
Maybe theyll keep us waiting

Shake the tips free Holds the pack forward

NELS (very quiet)
Maybe they wont

The way he said that Subtly ominous Ishmael watching Nels
face as the old man takes two cigarettes

NELS
Prejudice is like any obsession

Tucks one in his pocket And his eyes slide unmistakably to
Hatsue

NELS
Theres a reason why we cant
let go Even when we want to

Ishmael is stone still Nels just gazing at Hatsue Until

ISHMAEL
A reason

We dont want to

Looks back to Ishmael Very straight

Hate or love It works the same

In the silence

NELS (softly)
Her mother May have said
something

There it is Kindness in this old mans face He brings the
other

cigarette to his lips And Ishmael takes out the match box
Never

breaking eye contact
ISHMAEL
We dont let go yous

NELS
Its a rare thing Takes a
turning point

Expertly Ishmaels fingers withdaw a match

NELS
You gave this jury three chances
To turn

Palming the box Ishmael STRIKES the match On his belt
buckle

NELS
No other way to explain it all
That was one I caught some of

‘em fluttering waking up on that
Reaches the flame toward the old man

NELS
Second You sent him to
Manzanar and you didnt do
it alone I liked that one
they didnt No surprise

Nels leans to the flame Sucks it in Savors a drag

Asked so casually Ishmael turns Hatsue is standing now
surrounded by people her mother grasping her arm

ISHMAEL (a murmur)
Hooks called her deceitful
And I knew she wasnt
Hes watching her Across the way So intently

She was an honest person Doing

the best she could

We follow her approach toward the courtroom door She has not

You couldnt let her Be
helpless

mothers murmurings as she
disappears through the door Never having looked our way

When this verdict is read She
may look for your face

The bailiff does so walking crisply to minimize his moment in

Sstops Staring for a hung instant As if seeing something
unexpected he folds it again rather carefully thoughtfully

as he hands it back to the bailiff

Will the defendant please rise

Kabuo and Nels rise together But it is only into the

place Ive ever been

There is gentle laughter And as Kabuo looks up he sees
something
in the rear of the crowd Something we do not And softly

KABUO
No her first love was another

Which brings Hatsues eyes up following his gaze And there in
the back A man watches Eating a candy bar
