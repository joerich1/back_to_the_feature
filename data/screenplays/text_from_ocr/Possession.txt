A WOMANS VOICE speaks softly whispering
CHRISTABEL (V0)
There was once a little tailor a
good and unremarkable man

journeying through a forest And as
he advanced into the dark

SLOW FADE UP TO

EXT FAIRY TALE FOREST - DAYNIGHT

Moonlight A magical forest of trees Diamond shards of
blue light on wrinkled wormy roots Over the mossy gorse
steps --

A little TAILOR with scissors needles and thread hanging
from his belt A glass key round his neck And a tall
grey hound beside him He sees ahead --

A giant stone where a crack opens up The Tailor peers
inside And squeezes down inside a dark tunnel Which
leads out into --

INT STONE CHAMBER - DAYNIGHT

A shimmering hall of phosphorescent light The Tailor sees
a tall glass dome and a shining glass coffin on a velvet
pall surrounded by moths and butterflies

The Tailor peers inside the glass dome sees --

A miniature castle with windows and battlements

FROM POV - INSIDE GLASS COFFIN

The Tailor peers in to see a sleeping PRINCESS her
breath ruffling her golden hair In her hands a box like
a green ice egg

BACK TO SCENE

The Tailor -- takes his glass key slips it into the lock

CHRISTABEL (V0)

And the little tailor thought
to bend and kiss her perfect cheek
because he knew this was what he
must do

And kisses the Princess She opens her eyes full of
wonder

PRINCESS
You must be the one I have been
waiting for You must be the
prince

TAILOR
No you are mistaken I ama
tailor In search of work to keep
me alive

The Princess laughs And the sound of her laughter SHATTERS
the GLASS COFFIN into splinters And on the box CLOSE IN
and --

REVEREND (V0)
I am the resurrection and the
life said Jesus “He that
believeth in me though he were
dead yet shall he live

SLOW FADE UP TO a silvery BLACK AND WHITE --

EXT CEMETERY (LONDON) - DAY The box lies in the hands of a widow MRS ELLEN ASH in
front of a mausoleum Its a dripping November day sun low
in the sky

Ellen lifts back her veil to kiss the box Which she places
inside -- a wrought iron vault Its doors close

REVEREND
Let the body and soul of Randolph
Henry Ash lie in eternal peace
mourned by his sorrowing widow
Ellen

PULL BACK to see Ellen and mourners men in black hats and
cloaks like silk-clad ravens round an Egyptian-style vaulted
tomb Ellen focuses on the box behind a metal grille HOLD
ON -- the box

As before our eyes the box and tomb rapidly --

Age a hundred years Roses wither and die Moss weeds
leaves briars tendrils of undergrowth push and coil ‘round
the grille

REVEREND (V0)
honored not only by those of the
year of our Lord 1888 but by all of
time

And as a wind blows leaves FADE UP TO --

EXT LONDON STREETS (BLOOMSBURY) - DAY (PRESENT)

The spinning wheel of a bicycle The spokes blur in
a constant motion giving an illusion of stillness

anorak and cycle clips ROLAND MICHELL thirtyish dodges
down back streets cutting through into --

EXT BRITISH MUSEUM - DAY

Roland wheels his bicycle to sheds removes his clips
Oblivious to his trousers splashed by mud He unpacks his
bicycle panniers Heads through a side entrance into--

INT BRITISH MUSEUM - DAY

ECHOING domed hall He pauses by a party of TEACHER and
school-kids in front of a statue of an eminent Victorian

Through a door marked Ash Institute Director Professor
James Blackadder This is the Ash Factory A basement
of corridors in institutional grot Strip lighting
peeling paint-work

PAOLA a fifty-something secretary with moth-like glasses
glances up at Roland

PAOLA
‘Morning Roland Blackadders in a
panic Mortimer Cropper has landed

ROLAND
Oh God Did Blackadder finish my

PAOLA
I reminded him But you know what

Roland puts down his panniers squeezes past Paola into the
pantry He flicks on the kettle Looks for his coffee mug

ROLAND
Whos been using my mug

As he unscrews the coffee jar waiting for the kettle to
boil he turns to see at the door a grey-haired woman
staring at him

BEATRICE
If you have a minute Roland

This is Dr BEATRICE NEST doyenne of Ellen Ash studies and
Keeper of the Ash Museum an eccentric spinsterish scholar

ROLAND
Actually Beatrice I was about to
get started on those Ash
footnotes--

BEATRICE
Its important Its about Ellen

Ominous silence Roland registers Beatrices insistence

She disappears down the hall Roland has to follow her into
on

INT MUSEUM - ASH FACTORY - BEATRICES ROOM - DAY

A musty cavern of cardboard boxes and yellowing papers
Behind them almost bricked in sits Beatrice Who flings a
letter over to Roland

BEATRICE
I cant bear it Another letter
from that impossible woman Leonora
Stern She wants a piece from me
for some ghastly new journal about
Ellen Ashs sexual relations --

ROLAND
With Ash
BEATRICE
With anyone This womans obsessed

with sex

ROLAND
You protect Ellen from questionable
suitors Beatrice Ive always
admired that

BEATRICE
Ellen was a faithful wife And Im
faithful to her She needs
protection Im the only one now
who cares

One his rival a trendy young lecturer FERGUS WOLF the
other a bluff elderly Scottish professor JAMES BLACKADDER
Rolands boss

FERGUS

ROLAND
Fergus

BLACKADDER
Ah Roland I want you at the
London Library Come along
Croppers in town for the auction

Blackadder whisks Roland out from the room

INT MUSEUM - ASH FACTORY CORRIDORS - DAY

They walk down the corridor with Fergus Blackadder putting
on his coat

ROLAND
I feel sorry for poor Beatrice
Even the feminists hate her now for
championing a dull wife --

BLACKADDER
(exasperated)
Beatrice Nest and her bloody letters
of Ellen Ash are completely
irrelevant to modern scholarship
(MORE)

BLACKADDER (CONTD)
Shes wasted twenty-five years
looking up every recipe for
gooseberry jam and jaunt to
Broadstairs Thats what I get for
hiring a PhD from
(can barely say it)
New Zealand

FERGUS
The old witch Shes the best
keeper of the Ash Museum youll find

BLACKADDER
Yes Like Ellen Beatrice is best
behind closed doors

Blackadder and Fergus swoop off Roland watches them go
turns ‘round to see -- Beatrice scurry back into her room
like a crab Obviously overheard their comments Roland
sighs --

EXT LONDON LIBRARY (ST JAMESS SQUARE) - DAY (PRESENT)

An elegant London square Roland cycles in as leaves blow
from a tall tree towards a vast Victorian library where
people leave by stone steps armfuls of books As Roland
parks his bike --

Some LEAVES float away tumble towards a skylight on the
library roof TAPPING like birds trying to enter as --
INT LONDON LIBRARY - HALL - DAY

Roland enters the shabby hall Bespectacled scholars

shuffle around in a silent hum Roland seems suddenly at
home All around him wasted lifetimes devoted to books
INT LONDON LIBRARY - STACKS - DAY

Roland navigates like a mole accustomed to the dark through
amaze of metal shelves Hidden stairs and tiny corridors
like a Piranesi prison books piled high dark dusty
infinite

Roland seems to know his way even in the dark

INT LONDON LIBRARY - BASEMENT - RARE BOOKS DEPARTMENT -
DAY

Zig-zagging through a labyrinth of books Roland emerges
down in the basement He knocks at a door marked Rare
Books 5 No reply so he enters --

A musty room like a pharaohs tomb a high window casting
light into a cell of vellum and leather Roland puts files
down

ROLAND
My names Dr Michell Roland
Michell You have a copy of Donnes
poetry for me An 1858 edition

A pebble-glassed LIBRARIAN emerges crooked as his tottering
piles of books Slightly deaf he takes his time

LIBRARIAN
You ordered it through Professor
Blackadder over at the Ash
Institute

ROLAND
Correct Im working on the
Complete Works edition with him

LIBRARIAN
I didnt know Ash was an admirer of
Donne

ROLAND

He quoted one of Donnes poems on
his deathbed Im checking
references in the Nineteenth Century
editions just to be sure

The Librarian finds Rolands book bound with tape He
wipes away black dust hands it over Roland sits down
cracks pages apart

LIBRARIAN
Doesnt look like its been touched
for a while I11 check

Flicking through Roland sees notes scrawled in the margins

CLOSEUP - HANDWRITING

BACK TO SCENE
It intrigues him

ROLAND
Someones scrawled notes all over
the margins

LIBRARIAN

Hm Well its never been
called for as far as I know

(checks file cards as

Roland reads)
Odd According to our records
this edition was bequeathed to us by
Ashs widow Ellen

ROLAND
You mean this copy belonged to Ash
himself Someone must have
consulted it before now

LIBRARIAN
Seems it was lost in our filing
system

Intrigued Roland goes back to cutting leaves With great
delicacy he cuts open a set of pages suddenly two old
letters fall to the floor Roland bends down to pick them
up --

LIBRARIAN
(rambling on)
Devil and Demonology Dogs
Domestic Servants and Donne
(beat)
You can lose anything in here I
found a set of false teeth once

Roland isnt listening Dazzled by a thin shaft of
sunlight Roland starts to read On yellowing PAPER a
sound of a PEN SCRATCHING

And Ashs voice -- deep intimate -- OVER

ASH (V0)

Dear madam Excuse this letter
to a stranger Yet since our
pleasant and unexpected conversation
at Crabb Robinsons party I have
thought of nothing else

On hearing Ashs voice Roland turns the letters over Like
a spell the voice stops Roland stares hard at the
letters then looks back at the Librarian Concealing the
letters from view

Warily Roland turns the letters over again As Roland
reads the next passage his expression changes to wonder

ASH (V0)
IT feel I know with a certainty
that cannot be mistaken that you
and I must speak again

He reads on silently Then turns the letters over again
He folds back the book to the front paper A signature
Randolph Henry Ash Roland pulls the letter up beside the
signature --

ROLAND
Incredible
CLOSEUP - LETTERSIGNATURE

A match

BACK TO SCENE

Like a great poker hand Roland cant believe his luck
Suddenly alive confused palpitating he looks ‘round

LIBRARIAN

EXTREME CLOSEUP ON ROLAND
deliberating His heartbeat seems to pause Time stops
his whole life converges in a single moment Life or death

truth or lie a simple Yes or No

ROLAND
No Nothing really

frail

HILDEBRAND
But not frail enough

Envy in his voice as Cropper collects the rings

le

He wheels

Lord Ashs chair to the exit Blackadder and Fergus gossip

FERGUS
You have to hand it to Cropper
repackaging Ash as a New Victorian
All moral rigor and family values
Pure opportunism --

BLACKADDER
Now Newsweek picked it up the old
goat thinks hell get a Pulitzer for
his book Hideous
(beat)
But I wouldnt trust anyone faced
with Croppers loot

Blackadder rushes up to Cropper

BLACKADDER
Congratulations Professor Cropper

CROPPER
Ah Professor Dr Wolf Look at
these rings Wonderful things

He proudly holds up the rings before them All look on

CROPPER
I remember when my father would
amuse himself by placing the

say Here is history to hold in

Effortlessly superior Cropper smiles condescendingly

CROPPER
At the Cropper Foundation we dont
have a budget Just a check book

Roland rides up the lanes of rundown Stoke Newington
Outside a tall Victorian house Roland stops brings his
bicycle up steps Opens his doors and enters --

INT ROLANDS HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Locking his bicycle in the hall he picks up a pile of mail
And wearily goes down the stairs into the basement

INT ROLANDS FLAT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Portraits of Randolph Henry Ash stare down at a kitchen
table CATS gather MIAOWING for food as --

VAL his long-time girl friend sets down before Roland a
plate of lamb and ratatouille Its reheated and like
their relationship tepid and potentially poisonous

ROLAND

Shall I get a bottle of wine
VAL

You shouldve thought of that

before
Roland dutifully picks at the meat Then --

ROLAND
I made an amazing discovery today--

VAL
Itll go cold

ROLAND
I was in the London Library I
found Ashs own copy of Donne poems
with all his notes in the margins
And Im sure no one knew it was
there --

VAL
I expect they didnt

ROLAND
If I tell Blackadder I know
hell think its important --

VAL
I expect he will

Roland sees the bad mood Like a storm gathering strength

ROLAND
Im sorry to bore you Val It does
look exciting I can write it up
Itll make me a better job prospect

VAL
There are no jobs And if there
are they go to Fergus Wolf --

Val gets up from the table Roland dutifully prods the
lamb

ROLAND
If you think what I do is so
unimportant --

VAL
(lighting a cigarette)
You do what turns you on You have
this thing about this dead man Who
had a thing about dead people
Thats okay but not everyone is
very bothered about all that
(MORE)

VAL (CONTD)
(draws on cigarette)
IT see some things from my
menial vantage point in my lawyers
office Last week when Euan and I

Roland starts to feed cats below the table

ROLAND
Who

VAL
A lawyer In my office Oh never
mind

Val turns to him At first slowly calmly Then louder

VAL
I suppose I envy you piecing
together old Ashs world picture
Only where does that leave you old
mole Whats your world picture
And how are you ever going to afford
to get us away from dripping cat-
piss and being on top of one
another

Roland stares stricken by Vals show of temper

ROLAND
Somethings upset you hasnt it

VAL
Seems a reasonable deduction
EXTINT ROLANDS FLAT (STOKE NEWINGTON) - BEDROOM -

RUSTLES through a trees LEAVES MOVE IN THROUGH a WINDOW

INT ROLANDS FLAT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Sitting on the lowered loo seat Roland goes over the

RUSTLED by WIND with a strange harmonic MUSIC the letters
hover delicately in his hands Haunted by Rolands

DREAM - EXT HOUSE - CRABB ROBINSON PARTY
(BLACK and WHITE) - DAY

As Ash escorts Ellen into the house he carries on through a
party inside a conservatory of Oriental plants which
conceal guests playing blind mans bluff Ash sees a WOMAN
head turned away

ON that look --

ASH (V0)

Since our pleasant and
unexpected conversation at Crabb
Robinsons party I have thought of
nothing else

Ash is drawn towards the Woman -- FREEZE ON his expression
his features turn as if to stone as --

END OF DREAM

INT UNIVERSITY OF LONDON LIBRARY - AT DESK - NEXT DAY

Crisp pages of a yellowing volume Roland reads the journal
of Crabb Robinson An entry under 1858

CRABB ROBINSON (V0)

June 18 1858 My breakfast
party went off very well indeed I
had with me Mr Bagehot Mr Ash
Mrs Jameson Professor Spear
Mrs Lees Miss La Motte and her
friend Miss Glover the last
somewhat taciturn

Roland locks up scribbles a note Christabel La Motte
He dreamily sees --

FLASHBACK - EXT CRABB ROBINSONS HOME (RUSSELL

SQUARE) (BLACK and WHITE) - DAY In the conservatory Ash as before walking towards a
Woman turned away from him (and us)

The host CRABB ROBINSON a mustachioed aesthete observes
his guests

CRABB ROBINSON (V0)
Ash had never met Miss La
Motte who spoke more forcefully
than I expected She is
surprisingly handsome when
animated

In BLACK AND WHITE we see as distant shadows -- Ash with a
Woman -- Christabel La Motte -- and behind her another
Woman -- BLANCHE GLOVER an attractive but less confident
artist

CRABB ROBINSON (V0)
We all discussed with Mrs Lees
her claim to have conversed with the
spirit of Charlotte Bronte Mr
Ash appealed to Miss La Motte on the
question of visions and second
sight she declined to express an
opinion answering only with a Mona
Lisa smile

From Ash and Christabels smile Rapturous intense

ROLAND

jots down a reference 719640 Moves down to related
literature Roland holds a card at arms length From
behind a voice

FERGUS (0S)
I didnt know you had an interest in
Christabel La Motte

Roland turns sees Fergus peering over his shoulder Fergus
reaches over to investigate the card And laughs

ROLAND
I dont I never heard of her until
now
(beat)
Why did you laugh

FERGUS

Youre looking for an involuntary
expert There are two people in the
world who know all about Christabel
La Motte One is Professor Leonora
Stern from Tallahassee The real
expert is Doctor Maud Bailey at
Lincoln Cropper and I met them
both in Paris A conference on
sexuality and textuality

(beat)
A formidable pair they have quite
a thing together

ROLAND
A thing
FERGUS
I dont think they like men
ROLAND
Oh dear
FERGUS

Maud runs a resource center up there
in Lincoln Croppers funding it
Theyve got Christabels papers
there If you want anything thats
where to look

ROLAND
I might Thanks Whats she like

FERGUS
Unreadable The feminists are
interested in her Wrote a poem
about a fairy who married a mortal
for a soul --

ROLAND
I meant Dr Bailey Will she eat
me up

Fergus considers briefly A lot of undecodable feeling

FERGUS
She thicks mens blood with cold

ON Rolands look a mix of intrigue and worry --

EXT LINCOLN UNIVERSITY - NEXT DAY

The beautiful face of MAUD BAILEY pale and cool like a
marble statue Blonde hair up Maud stands in a doorway of
a modern campus block as past campus fountains and lawns --

Roland walks toward her As he closes in he is drawn in by
her beauty He recognizes it yet cannot even admit it

She is middle-class beautiful confident everything he
dare not aspire to

MAUD
You must be Dr Michell

ROLAND
Yes Roland

Maud offers him her long cool hand Roland puts down his
briefcase shakes her hand

MAUD
I hope you havent wasted your
journey Dr Michell

With neither a word nor a smile Maud turns walks into the
faculty building Roland takes a step remembers his
briefcase Turns back to pick it up and has to --

Catch up with Maud now several steps ahead opening a door
to --

INT FACULTY HALL (LINCOLN UNIVERSITY) - DAY

In a new building of beige wood and tinted glass Maud walks
with Roland towards an elevator Young punky female
students walk past rings in their noses holding hands
Roland sees no men

MAUD
On the phone you said you found a
connection between Randolph and Ash
and one of my poets

ROLAND
I found a draft of a letter in one
of Ashs books I thought it might
be to Christabel La Motte

MAUD
What sort of letter

ROLAND
A love letter I think

MAUD
Hard to believe Wheres your
evidence

Maud presses the button for the elevator They wait

ROLAND
There was a breakfast party June
18 1858 At the home of Crabb
Robinson I believe they met one
another there --

MAUD
You can never rely on Crabb
Robinson He was a notorious
gossip always inventing things

The ELEVATOR PINGS opens doors Maud and Roland step
inside

ROLAND
Of course but he has some curious
details

INT ELEVATOR - DAY
Inside the elevator Roland and Maud are uncomfortably close
together as they go down into the resource centers

basement

ROLAND
He says Ash and Christabel
discussed each others poems And
met the spiritualist Mrs Lees It
sounded plausible to me In 1861
Ash wrote Mummy Possest after a
seance --

MAUD
My Christabel was interested in
spiritualism But I dont think Ash
would have appealed to her His
poem is full of hatred for women --

ROLAND
Then its probably a wild goose
chase As you said
(beat)
I hope you dont think Ive made all
this up This relationship --

MAUD
You said connection Now its a
relationship
ROLAND

Between two people Two human
beings Isnt that normally called
a relationship

MAUD
Depends I think your theory is way
off the mark It sounds frankly a
little bizarre

Maud turns away heads off into the library Roland follows
her

ROLAND
I need to cross-reference it with
her journal You did say Christabel
kept a journal

MAUD
No But we have a diary by a friend
of Christabel An artist Blanche
Glover

ROLAND
Crabb Robinson mentions Miss Glover
Who was she

Maud picks up interest The ELEVATOR PINGS doors open
They walk out of the elevator towards the library doors

MAUD
Blanche was Christabels housemate -
- and most certainly her lover

In front of the doors Roland hangs back Maud holds the
door open

ROLAND
Am I allowed in

MAUD
Naturally

INT LIBRARY (LINCOLN UNIVERSITY) - RESOURCE CENTER - DAY

On a desk Maud brings out a box of musty manuscripts She
picks a single volume places it on the desk in front of
Roland A thick green leather-bound notebook

MAUD
Blanches diary was among
Christabels papers when she died
Leonora is looking for a grant to
have it edited Shes found a
researcher from France whos
interested But we cant go through
everything

ROLAND
Then Ill let you know what I find

Maud is about to go She relents giving in to her
curiosity

MAUD
I checked my files before you
arrived Christabel only referred
to Ash In a letter she wrote to
William Rosetti towards the end of

her life
(beat)

It was if anything hostile
(beat)

You have a couple of hours

Roland sits at a desk Illuminated by a shaft of overhead
light

ON COVER

A gilded dove flying out from a keyhole He opens the
lavishly-illustrated book with marbled endpapers

A Journal of Our Home-Life In Our House in Richmond
By Blanche Glover
Commenced on the day of our Setting up House
May lst 1853

As Roland flicks to June 1858 her writing is decorated with
pretty drawings slowly merging into swirling macabre
images

BLANCHE (V0)

June 18 1858 We went out to
breakfast at Mr Crabb Robinsons
home Present were Mr Bagehot
Mrs Lees Mr Ash the poet though
without Mrs Ash who was
indisposed

In his minds eye -- Roland tries to penetrate a misty cloud

FLASHBACK - EXT CRABB ROBINSONS HOUSE (RUSSELL SQUARE)
(SILVER NITRATE BLACK and WHITE) - DAY In a garden conservatory Ash moves towards a beautiful
woman back turned away from him Behind her as Ash draws
closer is --

A woman we now recognize as -- BLANCHE GLOVER

BLANCHE (V0)
The Princess was much admired
and rightly

Ash is intercepted by HELLA LEES a spiritualist Who
introduces the beautiful woman CHRISTABEL LA MOTTE a
beguiling pre-Raphaelite brunette

BLANCHE (V0)
She professed to like Mr Ashs
poem Ragnarok greatly Which
naturally flattered him

Christabel returns Ashs smile Modestly flirtatious she
is drawn into his orbit staring deep into his eyes

BLANCHE (V0)
This famous poet would have
been much surprised to know my true
opinion

Blanche watches Ash walk with Christabel away from her

BLANCHE (V0)
But I smiled and nodded as best
I might keeping my thoughts to
myself
(beat)
I desired to be at home

Blanche holds in her hand a book with an embossed gilded
dove on its cover Then --

INTERCUT WITH

ROLAND

Checking the clock flips through yellowing pages of
Blanches journal filled with portraits of Christabel

BLANCHE (V0)
My Princess is much exercised
about a long letter which arrived
today which she did not show me
but smiles over and caught up and
folded away

Slowly her portraits change into macabre drawings of
serpents and goblins Roland returns to a page hes
skimmed

BLANCHE (V0)
Letters letters letters

INT BLANCHE and CHRISTABELS HOUSE - DUSK

In the hallway a pile of letters Christabel picks them
up heads upstairs Followed at a distance by Blanche

Her face brooding and suspicious As Christabel drops a
letter --

Blanche picks it up goes to the door confronts her with
it Christabel runs upstairs sobbing

BLANCHE (V0)
Not for me You need not hurry
them away

INSIDE HER ROOM

Christabel hides letters in her sewing basket folds them
under handkerchieves Outside through the keyhole --

BLANCHE (V0)
I am no sneak no Governess
From that fate you rescued me my
Princess as I shall rescue you from
yours

Blanche spies in

EXTREME CLOSEUP - IN IRIS

Her eye large unblinking Blanche moves back stares out
the window The panes frame her face A storm is
beginning By candlelight --

BLANCHE (V0)
Now we have a prowler

Blanche sees tree shadows move across windows RAIN and
WIND HOWL outside WINDOW FRAMES RATTLE Blanches anger
mounts As branches scrape over windows --

BLANCHE (V0)
I hear him out there A wolf
at the door

Blanche watches as from outside something BANGS against a
door A low moan of CRACKING WOOD A latch is BATTERED
until ready to give In a reflection Blanche sees --

BLANCHE (V0)
This peeping Tom has put his
eye to our walls Now he peers
shamelessly in

A mans face -- Ash -- BOOM A sudden GUST OF WIND
Windows and shutters are blown in -- rain pours through A
silhouette -- a face like Ash Then the WINDOW BURSTS open

Splinters of glass fly towards Blanche --

SMASH CUT TO

INT LIBRARY - NIGHT

Silence Dusk has turned to night Beneath an isolated
pool of overhead light Roland looks up from the diary into
darkness Among the shelves a shadow stirs From the
darkness --

MAUD
Did you find anything

Maud steps into the light Stunned Roland closes the book

ROLAND
I think so

Alone together in the deserted library Unexpectedly
intimate even erotic Maud perches on a desk

ROLAND
Do you know about this prowler
Blanche was so worried about The
wolf at the door

MAUD
You think it may have been Ash You
saw her drawings Blanche had a
vivid imagination

On the desk Roland and Maud flick through Blanches macabre
drawings of labial flowers and serpents tongues

ROLAND
And was jealous

MAUD
Possibly If Christabel was her
lover Lovers do get jealous dont
they

ROLAND
What happened to Blanche

MAUD
She drowned in the Thames shortly
after completing this book
Suicide Christabel was distraught
It was all very sad
(beat)
But its getting late

ROLAND
I need to find out what happened
next

MAUD
Sorry not tonight The centers
closed

Roland looks at Maud Realizes now or never

ROLAND
Then Id better explain

Roland takes out the two stolen letters from his pocket He
tosses them on the table Maud starts to read them

ROLAND
I found these Theyre in Ashs
handwriting
MAUD
Youre sure theyre authentic
ROLAND
Ive checked Theyre dated June
19 1858
MAUD
The day after Crabb Robinsons
party
ROLAND

Precisely If I can find something
definite they could change our
whole idea of Ash

(beat)
And perhaps of Christabel

Mauds pulse quickens She finishes looks up regaining
her composure Senses their importance

ROLAND
I havent shown them to anyone else
No one else knows they exist I
found them in a book in the London

Library
MAUD
You stole them --
ROLAND

I dont think theyre mine or
anything But theyre not Croppers
or Blackadders or Lord Ashs
either Dont you see My Ash
lived a quiet and exemplary married
life Now suddenly

(beat)
A love letter to an unknown woman

As Roland ties himself in knots Maud is coolly accusatory

MAUD
I suppose they might represent a
considerable academic scoop For
you

ROLAND
Well I wanted to be the one who
does the work
(realizes her
insult)
Wait a minute -- it wasnt like
that
MAUD
Im sorry Id never have the nerve
to do that Steal them

ROLAND
It was an impulse For the first
time I felt Ash was alive in those
letters It was incredible Thats
why I need you to find out the truth
about Ash and Christabel --

MAUD
You know Cropper funds the center
If he finds out --

ROLAND
He wont If you dont tell him

MAUD
I cant let you Xerox Blanches
diary The spine wont stand it
Maybe you could copy it out I need
to think

ROLAND
You cant throw me out
MAUD
Can I book you a guest room
ROLAND
I dont have any money
MAUD
I thought you were working for
Blackadder
ROLAND

Part-time I also wash dishes ina
restaurant

Maud mulls it over

MAUD
Youd better come back to my place
(beat)
You can sleep on my sofa

Roland looks at the diary The traces of the faded brown
writing As Mauds hand rests close by

INT MAUDS FLAT - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

Outside in the hall Maud collects bedding plays back an
ANSWERING MACHINE MESSAGE from Cropper as in her sitting
room --

Photographers from Leonora letters from the Cropper
Foundation An illustrated book has been left open for him
on her desk

MAUD (0S)
I found something for you A first
edition of Christabels poem The
Fairy Melusina that Blanche
illustrated

ROLAND
Can I read it

MAUD Yes Its very beautiful Critics
still dismiss her poetry But I
always found it strange and
powerful Theres one passage about
a woman whod give anything for a
child even a hedgehog and duly
gives birth to a monster

Roland looks at the macabre illustration As Maud enters

ROLAND
I think Blanche is sorry for the
hedgehog

MAUD
Is she

(impressed by Rolands

insight Maud

examines a picture)
Yes maybe youre right Leonora
thought it was related to
Frankenstein the product of Mary
Shelleys horror of birth --

ROLAND
Thanks Ill read it Perhaps
itll help me sleep
(realizing his
mistake)
I didnt mean it like that

Maud throws him blankets Glares at him

MAUD
See you in the morning Theres a
train every hour

Maud closes the door Roland lies on the couch listening
to her in the next room He settles down picks up the book
of Christabels poetry starts to read In shadowy darkness

DISSOLVE THROUGH IRIS TO

EXT FOREST OF ARDEN (FAIRY MELUSINA LAND) - DAY

EMERGE as the IRIS OPENS OUT INTO a strange dreamlike place
of Christabels secret imagination a dark sinister
fairyland where owls cry wolves howl Through an enchanted
silver forest --

A distant KNIGHT in armor dismounts his weary blood-
spattered horse Over Christabel whispers her poem

CHRISTABEL (V0)
A draggled knight came riding
through the trees
Behind him fear before him
darkest night

The knight hears a song from a hollow chamber Inside a
glass coffin bound by silver chains and sapphire ropes
lies a fairy princess in white silk She holds a goblet up
to the Knight

KNIGHT (V0)
What I shall become I know
not
But I crave a place of rest
A draught of water for I choke
on dust

The Knight pulls back thorny briars steps into the mossy
hollow He shatters the glass coffin magically exploding
into shimmering splinters The Knight lets the liquid drop
on his tongue and --

dl

CHRISTABEL (V0)

All one long look consumed
his soul

Into desire beyond the reach of
hope

Beyond the touch of doubt or
despair

So that he was one thing and all
he was --

As the Knight kisses her her golden hair wraps itself
around him -- silver chains and emerald ropes bind his
limbs cut through his armor -- from her mouth a serpents
tongue darts out --

Plucks his eyeballs from behind his chain mail visor As
the Knight lets out a painful roar which freezes --

SMASH CUT TO

INT MAUDS FLAT - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

In the book -- A horrific woodcut illustration the fairy
princess as Roland catches his breath waking up--

Almost falls off Mauds couch He checks a clock Hears
DROPS OF WATER He gets up On Mauds mantelpiece Roland
is drawn to --

An old photo of a young Edwardian lady He looks closely at
the picture a bride clutching a bouquet of flowers On
the back an inscription MB On her wedding day

Intrigued Roland hears the DRIPPING sound GROW LOUDER as -

INT LIBRARY - RESOURCE CENTER - NIGHT

In the basement Blanches diary lies open Shafts of
moonlight on a deserted hall A breeze blows ruffling
pages past strange drawings of flying doves as --

Past an aisle of desks walks a shadowy figure humming a
childlike song Along the floor LEATHER SHOES SQUEAKING a
soaking wet dress trailing behind her sound of WATER
DRIPPING

As this figure vanishes through double doors

INT MAUDS FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

On her bed Maud lies asleep on her pillow A breeze blows
Maud stirs something enters the room

ON MAUDS FACE

Drops fall like tears Above her a pallid hand delicate
but withered As Mauds eyes flicker --

At the end of her bed -- bathed in palest lilac light
Blanches ghost stares at her wet clothes DRIPPING PUDDLES
OF WATER

From her pockets -- Blanche removes stones sewn with thread
into cloth She snaps each thread hurling stones up in the
air over Maud where --

They dont fall but float in the air Strange silvery
spiral shapes upon jet black surfaces --
INT MAUDS FLAT - NIGHT

Inside his room Roland is distracted by strange sounds
The SNAPPING of THREADS a SOFT HUMMING then

MAUD (0S)
No no no
INT MAUDS FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Still half-asleep Maud tosses her head Until Blanche
stretches out her hand strokes her face Desirous tender
filled with grief Blanche leans over Maud --

INTERCUT -- Roland on the other side of the door -- as --

BLANCHE
My dear princess

Blanches bedraggled tresses spill over Mauds face
Tenderly she lowers her lips in a kiss But Maud -- awakes
-- a shriek -- the ghost vanishes and --

Roland rushes in Maud sits up sobbing

ROLAND
What was it --

MAUD
I saw her

Suddenly Maud looks up at him --

ROLAND
You

Maud rushes into the other room Roland follows --

INT MAUDS FLAT - SITTING ROOM - DAWN

Maud by the mantelpiece next to the framed photo Roland
enters puts his hand on her shoulder

MAUD

I shouldnt have let you stay
ROLAND

Maud please --
MAUD

Go back to London I dont want you

here --
Maud picks up the framed photo hurls it to the floor

MAUD
Please --

Roland gives her a final look no chance but to accept

ROLAND
If thats what you want

Maud exits shuts the door behind her Roland kneels down
to pick up the mess Looks at the photograph initials

Next day Roland waits on the platform for his train Maud
waves briefly hurries away The train pulls in stops

ANNOUNCER (V0)
(over loudspeaker)
The train at platform two is the

Roland looks back sees Maud getting into her car A
WHISTLE BLOWS A moment of decision before the doors lock

Unlocks the door Gets out --

In time to see Maud driving away in her car Roland hails a
cab gets in Sets off following her --

EXT LINCOLN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Maud drives out of town into hills Her car twists round
country lanes drawing Roland onwards A dark sky glowers
as --

IN HER CAR

Maud sits staring ahead Almost trance-like She drives to
a place she obviously knows well Roland follows her up to

A remote village amid sweeping hills At its edge a
churchyard Roland loses Mauds car But as he nears the
church Roland --

EXT ST ETHELREDA CHURCHYARD (LINCOLN) - DAY
Sees her car parked nearby Roland stops his taxi

DRIVER
Not much round here Want me to
wait

Roland checks his pockets No money

ROLAND
No er
(an embarrassed
silence)
Ive done something silly I dont
have any cash --

The Driver looks at him Then at his wrist watch

EXT ST ETHELREDA CHURCHYARD (LINCOLN) - DAY

(FEW MOMENTS LATER)

The Driver zooms off -- Rolands watch now strapped to his
wrist As Roland sets off to search for Maud He wanders
round the old Norman churchyard Over in the distance
stands Maud

EXT ST ETHELREDA CHURCHYARD (LINCOLN) - DAY

A fierce wind blows as Roland hikes up towards her

Out on a hill over a deep narrow valley a graveyard
Maud hears him coming swivels round as he stands over her

MAUD
I asked you to leave me alone How
did you find me

ROLAND
Sorry I followed you I had so
many questions
(beat)
That girl in the photograph MB
Who was she

MAUD
May Bailey Christabels niece

ROLAND
Why did you have her picture

MAUD
Sophie La Motte was Christabels
sister She had a daughter called
Maia Everyone called her May
(beat)
She was my great-great-grandmother

ROLAND
So thats why youre so interested
in Christabel The family
connection

MAUD
No Christabel was so unhappy I
felt she was cursed I always
avoided her But her poetry always
drew me back This is where
Christabel died

Roland looks at the tombstone In white stone a female
saint curves round a humble tomb Christabel La Motte 1825-

ROLAND
She died alone

MAUD
Christabel never married She had
no children She spent her last
years living with Sophie and her
husband over at Seal Court

ROLAND
Where is that Nearby
MAUD
Not far You can see it over the

hill

A gale blows fiercer Above BRANCHES RUSTLE and CREAK
Roland picks up an old bouquet of rusting wire and dead
chrysanthemums

ROLAND
Can we visit

MAUD

Im afraid not Its not open to
the public Ive never even been
inside Leonora tried But she
didnt get on with the owners

(beat)
The wind is getting up You should
go now Ill drive you to the
station This time Ill make sure
you get on a train

As wind and rain blow across the saintly figure Roland
looks back up a hill Silhouetted on the skyline Roland
sees glints of silver -- a person in a wheelchair in
difficulty

ROLAND
Look Up there

To Mauds annoyance Roland heads off up the hill

EXT HILL - DAY

On the hilltop a wind blows as Roland rushes up Maud
follows behind Stuck in mud a branch has fallen in front
of a lady in a wheelchair silk scarves hat and boots
LADY JOAN

LADY JOAN
I seem to be stuck Bogged down
Foolhardy my husband says Most
humiliating Can you see the
offending object --

ROLAND
(shifting the
branch slipping)
There Its out of the way

Lady Joan lets off the brakes Maud arrives up the hill

MAUD
Just as well we were up here Are
you alright

LADY JOAN
I feel a bit shaky My dog is meant
to stay with me Never does
Useless great lump Useless If
youd accompany me to the foot of
the track my husband will get me --

ROLAND
I dont know round here Which way

LADY JOAN
Down there I live at Seal Court
My names Bailey Joan Bailey I
hope you dont mind Its not too
far

Maud looks at Roland who suppresses an exclamation

MAUD
Well take you there

EXT SEAL COURT - DAY

Dusk Rain Roland and Maud push Lady Joan up a weed-
infested driveway A tall tower dominates a huge crumbling
Gothic ruin covered in roses and vines Escaping the
storm they enter --

INT SEAL COURT - HALL - DAY

A grand decaying hall Stained glass windows Pugin-style
carvings rotting velvet tapestries and RAIN DRIPPING
NOISILY into buckets on stone floors

LADY JOAN
Better come into the servants hall
The only wing we use now My
husband should be there

Past a tiger rug on a wide floor Roland Maud and Lady Joan
pass through a temple of taxidermy surrounded by ancient
stuffed animals bear lion wildebeest Sadly moth-
eaten dilapidated

On wooden panelling a crest of arms a crossed shield
held by unicorn and centaur Now faded and abandoned
obviously broke

INT SEAL COURT - BAILEY LIVING AREA - DAY

Roland and Maud sit in a kitchen of faded grandeur piles
of newspapers pots of jam old shoes dog food broken
toasters

Her husband SIR GEORGE sits with The Sporting Life
watching TV horse-racing While Lady Joan serves tea from a
china service preserving an air of decorum

LADY JOAN
I suppose we must be related
Miss Bailey But the Lincolnshire
Baileys never got on with the
Norfolk Baileys Family feud
(beat)
Tea Mr Michell You say youre a
writer

ROLAND
Not quite A research assistant
Im working on a scholarly edition
The complete works of Ash the
Victorian poet --

Roland clears a space on the table Sir George shouts up
from TV

SIR GHORGE
Old Tommy Bailey named a horse after
him Cant think why Did him at
school once

LADY JOAN
We had a sort of poet in this
house

SIR GHORGE

The little lady poet Terrible
stuff about fairies

LADY JOAN
Mr Michell and Miss Bailey might
like poetry --

SIR GEORGE
They cant like Christabel La Motte

MAUD
I do We were visiting her grave

Sir George puts down his paper glares at Maud

SIR GHORGE
Who was that frightful nosy American
female ranting about the state of
the grave Youre not in league
with her --

Maud kicks Roland beneath the table Smiles at Sir George

MAUD
No I remember Christabel
described the Seal Court garden in
winter as she walked there with her
dog

Maud goes to the window looks out onto an overgrown garden
with a chipped stone pond at the center

MAUDS POV

A ghost of a hound walks across the landscape then vanishes

BACK TO SCENE

MAUD
the sheltered bench and the
silvery fish in the little pool
even under the ice I could see them
suspended
(beat)
Ive been studying her life

SIR GEORGE
Not much of a life She shut
herself away in the East Wing tower

MAUD
Thats what she must have seen

LADY JOAN
The east wings never been used I
came here as a bride in 1929 No
ones touched her room since then

Maud looks through the window a Gothic tower in rain and
wind

LADY JOAN

We must find the scones Im afraid
we dont have too many luxuries
here But one has to make an
exception --

(to Sir George)
After tea I think you should show
these young people Christabels
room That is if they want to see

Roland looks at Maud whose eyes betray her excitement

INT SEAL COURT - EAST WING TOWER - DUSK

Outside a storm Up a towering spiral staircase Sir George
leads with an old lantern Maud and Roland follow with the
Labrador up CREAKING BOARDS night sky visible through gaps
in ceiling

SIR GHORGE
No electricity in this wing Closed
since the First War

Roland stumbles puts his foot through a rotten board

SIR GHORGE
Careful Dont want to lose you

Maud and Roland look up the winding stair a panelled door
with a latch Sir George tries pushing it then pulls it
open A wind rushes through as --

INT SEAL COURT - CHRISTABELS ROOM - DUSK

By lantern-light Roland and Maud see a panelled room with a
box-bed a mahogany desk carved with goblins a rocking
horse heavy trunks and bureau drawers In a wall beside
the bay-window --

A gaping hole A pigeon flutters out --

SIR GEORGE
Damn --

Sending the lanterns light across a mirror entwined with
gilded roses

In its reflection Maud and Roland see a row of -- staring
tiny white faces propped against an embroidered cushion

MAUD
The dolls --

On the bed three dolls with china faces gold hair black
hair and a white nightcap All stare with blue glassy
eyes

MAUD
Christabel wrote poems about her
dolls Heres one

Maud picks up the cushion embroidered with verses and
daisy chains Meanwhile as Sir George inspects rain damage

ROLAND
I suppose any papers were cleared
from her desk May we look

The wind blows out his lantern The room plunges into
darkness

SIR GHORGE
-- Not now Too windy The boards
are all rotten Best wait until
morning

MAUD
Morning

SIR GEORGE
Im sure Lady Jean will want you to
stay --

MAUD
But thats --

ROLAND
-- very kind of her

Maud still holding the cushion glares at Roland
SIR GHORGE
Good Joanie loves having someone
to talk to
INT SEAL COURT - KITCHEN - NICHE
Outside a storm Ice on the windows

Steam from the kettle as Lady Joan boils up for the hot
water bottles

LADY JOAN
I think we should get the bed made

Sir George scurries across with another antique hot water
bottle

MAUD
Youre sure both of us can stay
This isnt an imposition --

LADY JOAN
Nonsense --

SIR GHORGE
Ill go up and see to the bed Ill
need help with the sheets --

ROLAND

MAUD

Sir George and Maud head upstairs Lady Joan fills the
kettle She has taken to Roland addresses him
affectionately

LADY JOAN

something

ROLAND
Tiff

LADY JOAN

ROLAND
Oh no That is no tiff and she
isnt -- my girl friend I hardly

LADY JOAN (CONTD)

hot water bottle)
I hope you arent frozen in that
great draughty room

EXT SEAL COURT - NIGHT

Wind rain A pristine magical setting Trees
fantastically hung with ice a pond glints in moonlight
water covering with ice Frozen gold and silver fish swim
beneath the surface glowing

INT SEAL COURT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

In the old main bedroom Roland -- in old jumpers -- makes
up an armchair as a bed Bitterly cold As they talk Maud
gets undressed behind a screen

MAUD
You didnt have to stay the night

ROLAND
Lady Joan wanted us to They think
were a couple Besides theyll
let us look at Christabels room
tomorrow

MAUD
I could have come back on my own

ROLAND
Youre stuck with me now Youd
never have got in here without me

MAUD
That doesnt mean Im grateful
Turn around

Roland dutifully snuggles into the armchair as Maud emerges
from behind the screen in her bedtime outfit a sugar-pink
winceyette nightdress over long johns knitted mittens
Arran sweater

ROLAND
Then Ill have to tell Sir George
how you and Leonora are such good
friends Im sure hed be very
interested

MAUD
You wouldnt do that

ROLAND
Of course I would Leonora must
have really offended him

As Maud gets into her bed for added protection from the
cold and Roland she puts on a knitted balaclava Only her
eyes are visible peeping out

MAUD
(getting into bed)
She only complained about the state
of Christabels grave But she got
Sir George all upset It ended with
him firing shots --

ROLAND
Attempted murder Thats handy for
blackmail

MAUD

Ive heard enough from you I want
to go to sleep

Maud rolls over an embroidered cushion next to her head
Roland lies staring at the ceiling

ROLAND
You know in the beginning they
were very romantic --

MAUD
Who

ROLAND
Ash and Ellen He took her to the
south of France for their honeymoon

MAUD
Roland this is no time for a
lecture --

ROLAND

I always think of them as having a
perfect marriage no children just
lives devoted to poetry --

MAUD
Just like Christabel --
ROLAND
At least they had something in
common
MAUD

Good night Roland

ROLAND
Good night

Maud grabs the cushion Roland switches out the light
Darkness

INT SEAL COURT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

In another far-away bedroom smothered in blankets and
paraffin stoves lie Sir George and Lady Joan fast asleep
With the Labrador curled up between them

Maud is not beside him Nor is the cushion The candle has
burnt down He gets out of bed lights another

Out into corridors Roland steps with his light

He walks down a long hallway reaches the east wing the
door to the tower

Roland walks up up up He reaches the panelled door He
pauses pulls the door open enters to see --

INT SEAL COURT - CHRISTABELS BEDROOM - NIGHT

By candlelight WIND still HOWLS in Roland sees --

the golden-haired doll He picks it up And -- as he
stoops down Roland looks up to see -- Maud He gasps in

shock --

MAUD
Quiet -- They might hear us --
ROLAND
-- What are you doing --

Maud points to the embroidered cushion a poem sewn in a
childish design around a daisy chain

MAUD
I couldnt sleep I think Dolly is
hiding something Look
(beat)
Dolly keeps a Secret Safer
than a Friend
Dollys Silent Sympathy Lasts
without end
Friends may betray us Dollys
lips are sealed
Could Dolly tell on us Much she
concealed
(beat)
Give me the knife

Roland hands her the knife Maud unpicks a knotted ribbon
As the ribbons unravel the silk gown opens up padding
spills out and --

MAUD
Somethings inside

Among tufts of duck down -- a package Wrapped in white
linen with tape like a mummy Maud unwraps it and out fall

TWO BUNDLES OF OPEN LETTERS

Maud picks up one pile in handwriting Randolph Henry
Ash Esq 29 Russell Square London Roland picks up the
other to Miss Christabel La Motte Bethany Mount Ararat
Road Richmond

ROLAND
Ashs handwriting Look at the
dates He did send it How did you
know

MAUD
I didnt
(beat)
This is Christabels writing too
Read yours

Roland picks out a letter written in Ashs distinctive
handwriting He can hardly speak --

ROLAND
(reading the
letter)
Dear Miss La Motte Excuse this
letter to a stranger It was a
great pleasure to talk to you at
dear Crabbes breakfast party May
I hope you too enjoyed our talk --
and may I have the pleasure of
calling on you
(to Maud)
And the answer Did she answer

Maud takes a letter carefully unfolds it

MAUD

(reading the

letter)
The next day Dear Mr Ash I
am a creature of my Pen my Pen is
the best of me and I enclose a
Poem in earnest of my great
goodwill towards you

ROLAND
Go on Please

Maud holds up the letter About to read then --

MAUD

No It wouldnt be right
ROLAND

Excuse me
MAUD

You should read Ashs letters I11
read Christabels

ROLAND
But why

MAUD
Those are the poets that interest
each of us --

ROLAND
But theyre writing to one
another --

MAUD
Thats not the point How can I be
expected to remember Christabels
words --

ROLAND
But if theyre love letters dont
you want to hear what he wrote to
her

MAUD
Roland please This is not the
time for your theories --

Maud freezes him with a glance They settle on the floor
both take their respective piles And sit there opening
letters in silence Roland opens his reads a little --
then stares at Maud Who produces from her pockets a pencil
and some index cards

ROLAND
What are you doing

MAUD
I have some cards I need to record
her observations Its a system I
use at the center --

ROLAND
This is ridiculous --

MAUD
I have to be methodical We can
cross-refer later Just because
youre unprepared --

ROLAND
Unprepared -- Its the middle of
the night I want to get a sense of
what happened to them how they felt

MAUD
Roland youre a scholar Theres
no need to get carried away

Maud goes back to reading Coldly hostile she doesnt look
up Roland picks up his letters starts reading Silence
Their senses are drawn into the words until --

ROLAND (V0)

(from the letter)
Dear Miss La Motte You
encourage me more by your permission
to write again than by your wish
not to be seen Perhaps you will
tell me about your Fairy Melusina
poem

Roland stops reading He looks across at Maud Who frowns
with concentration making neat notes

ROLAND
Sorry to interrupt
(as Maud looks up)
Was Christabel still living in
Richmond when she wrote The Fairy
Melusina

MAUD
Yes

ROLAND
With Blanche
(as Maud nods)
Hmmm

MAUD
Why do you ask

ROLAND
Ash seems to have written to

Christabel about her poem At some
length

MAUD
Oh

ROLAND
Yes Quite interesting

Roland lets it drop But Mauds curiosity is piqued

MAUD
May I look

ROLAND
A quick glance

Maud peers over sees the reference Looks up

MAUD
What did he say

ROLAND
I dont know Im just in the
middle
MAUD

Of course Maybe you could

ROLAND
Read it aloud

MAUD
Just the reference to her poem --

ROLAND
Of course If you insist

As Roland starts to read aloud

END OF FLASHBACK

CUT BACK TO

caught in a spell in each others eyes

ROLAND
How did she reply

Maud goes for the next letter Then pauses

electrified --
MAUD
I cant go on My hands are
trembling
ROLAND

Let me find it for you
(fiddles among
the letters)
Its the next day They were
writing every day

Roland selects the right datemark pulls out the faded
letter hands it to Maud

ROLAND
Do you want to read it

MAUD
Just this one

Who trembles as she opens it up She looks up at Roland as
she reads --

MAUD
My dear friend how shall I
answer Your inspiration means so
much to me Yet I feel I cannot
continue our correspondence
Blanche and I have made a pact
chosen a way of life I cannot
choose to break it

Roland watches Maud reading his eyes over her face in the
candlelight Sensing their deep immersion in this love
story

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO

FLASHBACK (BLACK AND WHITE) - EXT RICHMOND STREETS -
NIGHT

A rainstorm Up the hill Christabel and Blanche walk
followed at a distance by FOOTSTEPS Outside their house
Blanche pauses turns suspiciously She sees nobody They
enter their house --

CHRISTABEL (V0)
You will say you are no threat
to that I know the threat is
there Perhaps it would be better
if we ceased to correspond

INT BLANCHE AND CHRISTABELS HOUSE - NIGHT

The WIND HOWLS A storm blows From inside Blanche looks
out from behind shutters The night of the Prowler

CHRISTABEL (V0)
The world would not look well
upon such letters between a woman
and a married man -- even if that
man were a great and wise poet
Your friend Christabel La Motte

Down the street stands a man in black cloak and umbrella
next to a hansom cab Windswept lashed by rain reveal --
Ash eyes fixed upon the house Through trees on the
window Blanche

CRASH -- The WINDOW SMASHES SPLINTERS --

ASH (V0)
I cannot forgive myself
I have no designs on your freedom
I know too well the unhappiness a
lack of freedom can bring This
must be your choice And yet

EXT RICHMOND HOUSE - DAY
A postman arrives puts the letter into the letterbox
ASH (V0)
Our inspiration is so rare so

special I cannot think it better if
we ceased to correspond

INT RICHMOND HOUSE - DAY

THROUGH the letterbox the postmans letter falls to the
floor It lies on the hallway like an evil omen

ASH (V0)
I shall send you the manuscript
of my new poem with the ink barely
dry inspired by the thought of
you Ever yours most truly

Christabel picks up the letter only to reveal -- Blanche
upstairs behind her She swoops down snatches the letter
takes out pages of handwritten poetry Christabel tries to
retrieve --

A struggle Blanche throws off Christabels hand who
recoils Blanche takes the poem holds it up in front of
her --

CHRISTABEL (V0)
I dare not write more Your
poem is lost I cannot be sure any
further letter of yours will reach
me

Christabel walks upstairs enters her room closes the door

CHRISTABEL (V0)
And shall I give up No I
will not If it is possible for you
to walk in Richmond Park at eleven
I shall be there

Out of the window Christabel sees Blanche leave the house

BLANCHES POV

She looks back up at Christabel like a princess in the
tower Blanche clutches the letters in her cloak hurries
away

END OF FLASHBACK

INT ATTIC - CHRISTABELS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Maud looks up at Roland faces by lantern light surrounded
by letters Roland opens up another hands it to Maud who
pauses Gently touches his hand listening to the WIND
HOWLING --

MAUD
Theyre here with us now Arent
they

Roland looks into her eyes Maud picks up a letter opens
it In Christabels handwriting the words seem
terrifyingly real

MAUD
(reading)
This is a moment of madness
You have summoned me out of my tower
-- and out of my wits I did not
think you would come

The WIND HOWLS and with a ROLL of THUNDER --

FLASHBACK - EXT RICHMOND PARK - DAY Black clouds A LIGHTNING STORM ROLLS Lost in a silver
forest his horse tethered nearby Christabel turns towards
Ash His eyes on hers her pale face trembling she holds
out her hand to him

ASH (V0)
And then it was my madness
For in that moment I could take
your hand or not Do the deed
or turn back forever I was able to
choose either path

Ash reaches out takes her hand gloved Puts it to his
cheek

ASH (V0)
And now only the one

The moment of contact is too much Christabel watches as
Ash takes her glove slowly unpeels it Lets it lie limply
then --

Kisses her hand A moment of perfect stillness And in
that moment for the first time we hear Christabels voice

CHRISTABEL
What are we to do

Ash and Christabel stare into one anothers eyes

ON ASH

ASH (V0)
There is a fire within us which
must burn

INT ASHS HOUSE (RUSSELL SQUARE) - DAY By candlelight inside his study Ash sits with his books
composing a letter to Christabel In the bg --

ASH (V0)

I had a plan to go away to
Yorkshire There are reservations
for two I beseech you to accompany
me

(beat)
I shall wait at noon St Agness
Church

Ellen hovers like a ghost peering out of the window She
looks out to raindrops on the windowpane A servant removes
Ashs bag Ash kisses Ellen upon the cheek And heads
downstairs

EXT ASHS HOUSE (RUSSELL SQUARE) - DAY

A driver waits luggage and gear on a carriage Ash gives a
letter for Christabel to a messenger Who races off The
horses set off Ash in the back A CLOCK CHIMES One two
three

ASH (V0)
I write in haste I fear your
answer -- I know not whether to

depart or no
Besides Ashs carriage another black carriage pulls up with
a white crest Then as Blanche steps out --
INT ST AGNESS CHURCH - DAY At the back of the knave Ash kneels in prayer He hears
the CLOCK STRIKE TWELVE Ash turns sees an outside door
open slowly Daylight comes into darkness The candles
flutter as --

MAUD (V0)

Did she go with him

INT SEAL COURT - CHRISTABELS ROOM - DAY (PRESENT)

Dawn Maud and Roland lie together surrounded by the
letters

ROLAND
Theres one left

MAUD
You read it

Roland picks up a final letter From Christabels pile He
reads it in silence intrigued by its contents

ROLAND
Its from Christabel She asks Ash
to return all her letters --

MAUD
Is there any more There must be

Frustrated Maud rummages among the letters Suddenly a
door opens Maud and Roland looks up to see --

Sir George staring at them

SIR GEORGE
What in hells name --

On the floor letters are fanned out Dolls lie ribbons
untied dresses unravelled Maud and Roland look up at Sir
George

ROLAND
Sir we found letters from Ash and
Christabel --

MAUD

This could change everything --
Sir George points his hunting gun at them

SIR GHORGE
Hands up --

EXTINT SEAL COURT - HALLLIVING AREA - DAY (LATER)

Roland stands outside whistling Waiting for the taxi
Inside -- Maud descends the staircase sees Sir George in
the hall on the telephone Maud enters --

KITCHEN

where the letters lie on a mound of yellowing newspapers
Lady Joan greets her sympathetically

MAUD
Once its known these letters exist
everyone will be at your door
Everyone

LADY JOAN
Oh dear Sir George has a fizzing
temper Im sorry you have to go

From outside the taxi BEEPS its HORN Roland waves to
Maud

MAUD
So am I

EXT ST ETHELREDAS CHURCH - DAY

VOOM VOOM -- Maud REVS up her CAR outside the church
where they left it She pulls out past the taxi which
dropped them Beside her Roland looks downcast

ROLAND
They must be worth a fortune

MAUD
We both had the same instinct To
play them down Cropper would love
to get his hands on them Do you
think we should tell him --

ROLAND
No -- theyd be in New Mexico
tomorrow Hes have to sit on them
Or his whole theory about Ash would
be blown away --

MAUD
Sir George would be a lot richer
He could mend that house --

ROLAND
I dont know why I feel so
possessive about the damned things
Theyre not mine

MAUD
We found them And theyre private
Theyre love letters Ill bet Sir
George will sell them

A moment passes Roland is agitated He turns to Maud
ROLAND
We should make a pact If one of us
finds out any more he or she tells
the other and no one else

Maud comes to a crossroads Left to Lincoln right to the

North She pauses Then revs up sets off Roland expects
to turn left -- to Lincoln She turns right

ROLAND

You went the wrong way
MAUD

Were not going back to Lincoln
ROLAND

Where are we heading
MAUD

Whitby

(beat)

We have to find out Did Christabel
go there with Ash

Maud stares at Roland HOLD ON his expression As the bg
whizzes past --

EXTREME CLOSEUP

An intense sound of WHEELS POUNDING a CLICKETY-CLACK rhythm
-- a relentless HISS of STEAM and ROARING FIRE that bursts
into a PIERCING WHISTLE -- that tears through time as --

SMASH CUT TO

FLASHBACK - INT TRAIN - RAILWAY CARRIAGE (YORKSHIRE) -
DAY Black smoke billows in a hellish cloud as an iron
juggernaut zooms on landscape zips past a window at
breakneck speed as -- in DAZZLING VIVID COLOR --

ASH

looks out of a window with a patch of warm breath A
gloved hand wipes through the haze to reveal in the
reflection Christabels face in bright sunlight Both
nervous they sit opposite one another Both with books
upon their knees Ash suddenly looks up He has been
planning his speech --

ASH
Forgive this boldness What I do
not know is whether you wish to
travel as my wife It is a large
step --

CHRISTABEL
I want to be with you I am quite
happy to be called your wife That
is what I had understood I -- we --
had decided

ASH
You must not regret this

CHRISTABEL
Of course I shall regret So will
you will you not But that is of
no importance at this time

Silence Then from his pocket a box inside a gold
signet ring

ASH
I hope you will accept this ring

CHRISTABEL
My resolution was as strong as
yours

She produces her own ring jade with initial CC They
smile Ash peels off her glove He pushes his ring over
hers

CHRISTABEL
So it is done

Ash holds onto her hand Suddenly with a WHOOSH of smoke
the TRAIN plunges into flickering darkness of a tunnel Ash
presses her hand to his lips Shards of sunlight flicker
like a kinematoscope on his face Ash lets her fingers fall
Then -- into light again -- Ash turns her leather glove in
his hands smoothing its soft leather pockets back into
shape like a fetish Staring at her

EXTINT WHITBY HOTEL - DUSK Late sun A white hotel perched on a cliff looking out to
sea As if in a vivid dream -- Ash and Christabel dismount
from a horse-drawn carriage The hotelier MRS CAMMISH
organizes the baggage hatboxes trunks collecting boxes
nets writing desks Which are carried upstairs as -- Ash
and Christabel go to a window A view over cliffs of grey
sea

ASH
There The German sea Like steel
with life in it

CHRISTABEL
It reminds me of the Breton coast
Which is in some sense my home
Its so changeable Blue and clear
one day the next dark and wild

ASH
(awkwardly)
I -- we -- must go there too There

are so many places Even around
here Such curious northern names
Ugglebarnby Jugger Howe Howl

Moor --

CHRISTABEL
On the map I saw one The Boggle
Hole

She starts to laugh Ash smiles too
ASH
The Boggle Hole
(laughs too)
Do you like the sound of that Then
we shall go there
Ash says it agreeably Christabel relaxes a little

CHRISTABEL
I should like that Very much

Outside a wind blows in from the sea as --

END OF FLASHBACK

SMASH CUT TO

INT WHITBY HOTEL DINING ROOM - DUSK

outside a picture window a tall TREE RUSTLES in the wind
In a large Victorian room now with modern furniture --

Maud and Roland at a table busy with piles of books and
notes Map open beside Croppers biography of Ash Roland
jots down names Boggle Hole

ROLAND
Theres a place on the map the
Boggle Hole Thats a nice word
Maybe we could go --

(MORE)

ROLAND (CONTD)
(off Maud deep
in her book)
Found anything

MAUD
(looking up)
Ive been reading Ashs love poems
Most love poetry is only talking to
itself But Ash wasnt I think he
was talking to her

ROLAND
To Ellen --
MAUD
No Christabel
(beat)
I like them now
ROLAND
Im glad you like something about
him
MAUD

I didnt say 1 didnt like Ash I
only thought Christabel wouldnt
like him Ive been trying to
imagine him Them

ROLAND
They must have been in an extreme
state A moment of madness brought
them here threw their lives up in
the air Just like us--

MAUD
They were in love

ROLAND
Of course Dont you envy them

MAUD
I dont know We never say the word
love do we Its always sex We
see it everywhere We say were
driven by desire but we cant see
it as they did

ROLAND
Sometimes I feel that the best state
is to be without desire I have
this image of a clean empty bed in a
clean empty room where nothing is
asked or to be asked --

MAUD
Thats what I think about too when
Im alone The same image An
empty bed in an empty room All
white

ROLAND
Exactly the same

Outside a gust of WIND RUSTLES LEAVES Mrs Cammish enters

with a tray Maud presses her napkin to her lips dabs her
mouth

MAUD
How strange

Instinctively Maud stares down at her napkin In that
moment --

CLOSEUP
ON the imprint of her lipstick --
CUT TO

FLASHBACK - INT WHITBY HOTEL - DINING ROOM - DUSK

Christabel lowers her napkin politely stares back at Ash
seated opposite As a 19th Century Mrs Cammish fusses at
the table Now a private dining suite decorated in
Victorian damask finery

MRS CAMMISH
Your lady wife is looking a bit
peaky sir Not eating her food

ASH
Soup Boiled hake and potatoes
Cutlets and peas Arrowroot molds
and treacle tart We have dined
well Mrs Cammish

MRS CAMMISH
A spot of sea air Thats the tonic
for your wife sir I can tell
shes a chilly mortal --

Mrs Cammish breezily removes her tray exits Christabel
smiles politely as Ash takes out a thin cigarillo from a
silver case

ASH
Mrs Cammish is right You must
enjoy the sea air

CHRISTABEL
Perhaps it is considered a wifely
pursuit I think Mrs Cammish
considers me lacking in wifely
virtues

Ash lights the cigarillo takes a lung-full of smoke

ASH
I care not for such wifely virtue
(beat)
Will you go up first my dear

Christabel stands up strained but mocking She smiles

CHRISTABEL
If you wish my dear

Christabel takes a lit candle exits Ash walks to the
window Enjoys his cigar smoke curling in front of him the
CRASH of the SEA below as Mrs Cammish reappears

ASH
Do you have a cognac

MRS CAMMISH
Nothing French in this house sir

ASH
Quite so
(to himself beneath
his breath)
“Le degout cest voir juste Apres
la possession lamour voit juste
chez les hommes -- Balzac

MRS CAMMISH
No cognac and no Balzac neither
sir

ASH
(beat)
Good night Mrs Cammish

Mrs Cammish exits Ash blows a last puff of cigar smoke
then --

INT WHITBY HOTEL - HALLWAY AND STAIRS - NIGHT Ash walks down a dark hall past towering plants elaborate
mosaics to the stairs Maids dutifully wax wood shine
brass

ASH (V0)
Dear Ellen Today I made a
curious geological discovery

Ash mounts stairs footsteps muffled by carpet He nears
the top on his face -- dread and wonder Ash walks down
the corridor

ASH (V0)
Adornments may be made here
from ancient ammoniate fossils
creatures long dead but not
vanished They are jet black with
a special silver lustre In this
very marvel of science I now see a
perfect miracle

Two chambermaids walk past Ash curtseying Ash stubs out
his cigarillo on a brass ashtray He stands in front of the
room then opens the door --

INT WHITBY HOTEL - BEDROOM - NIGHT Ash enters a dark candle-lit room On a chair sits a --

Crinoline petticoat like a collapsed cage all steel hoops
and straps To one side a brass bed Where Christabel
stands her back to him arms on the rails in a corset

CHRISTABEL
I need some assistance

Ash moves over to her His fingers pick up fine long
laces unthreads trembling over boned silk he fumbles
drops them

ASH
I am inexperienced in such matters

Christabel does not look back She pulls her hair up to
reveal the nape of her neck downy hair by candlelight Ash
sees the swell of her breasts as he plants

A kiss upon her bare shoulder And with a whisper --

ASH
You are safe with me

CHRISTABEL
I am not at all safe with you
(beat)
But I have no desire to be
elsewhere

Ash unthreads the laces He feels the curve of her waist
her hips Slowly as she turns to undo his collar stud she
kisses him on his neck As ina

MONTAGE

of buttons and laces -- stockings unrolled -- corset removed
-- candle blown out --

UPON BED

Ash embraces her

CHRISTABEL
Are you afraid

ASH
Not now my white lady

Christabel
Ash takes her in his arms They lie upon the bed

ASH
Do not fight me

CHRISTABEL
I must

On a bedside table a candle flame flickers --

And is love more
Than the kick galvanic

END OF FLASHBACK

INT WHITBY HOTEL - ROLANDS BEDROOM - NIGHT

A pool of light from a bedside lamp as Roland murmurs a
poem aloud from a book of Ashs poetry

ROLAND
Or the thundering roar
Of the Ash volcanic
Thrown from some crater
Of earth-fire within

Roland walks over to the bathroom A heavy latched door
He knocks no reply Then opens the door --
INT WHITBY HOTEL - BATHROOM - NIGHT

The door swings in -- IN SLOW MOTION Steam gathers in cold
air Roland nearly falls over a part-naked figure--

Maud in a silken robe who steadies herself on his shoulder

Roland throws up a hand clasps her supple body beneath her

robe -- Maud gasps An electric current between
them --
ROLAND
I knocked -- Im sorry

Roland briefly clutches the silk He lets it go as if
stung He sees her hair -- damp over bare shoulders and
neck Beads of water running down to her breasts

MAUD
(composing herself)
I waited some time for you to use
the bathroom

ROLAND
So did I I was looking for a light

MAUD
Well
(closes her robe)
no harm done

ROLAND
No Maud --

Roland reaches out Maud withdraws

ROLAND
If we dont find anything Im sorry
for getting you into this I know
it was my fault

MAUD
Its okay I dont blame you

ROLAND
I wanted us to find something
together I really did And if we
reach a dead end then

MAUD
I wanted this to happen too Well
think of something
(beat)
Good night

Maud exits closing the door Leaving Roland in the foggy
steam looking at himself in the mirror -- in which he sees
a blurred figure He wipes away the steam to see a swirl of
white sheets --

FLASHBACK - INT WHITBY HOTEL - BEDROOM - NIGHT In darkness Ash awakes Not beside him He sees her over
by a windowseat In a swirl of sheets he gets up goes
over Finds her shaking silently with tears He puts out
an arm

ASH
What is it my dear

CHRISTABEL
How can we bear it For so short a
time How can we sleep this time
away

ASH
We can pretend that we have all the
time in the world

CHRISTABEL
And every day we shall have less
And then none

ASH
Would you rather have had nothing at
all

CHRISTABEL

No We are here we are now Let
me hold you

Christabel caresses Ash He kisses her neck her breast

CHRISTABEL
You will burn me up
ASH
Then let us burn until we are both

consumed

Ash kisses her Draws his hand down her body to her breast

ASH
Now I know you truly

CHRISTABEL
Yes I admit You know me

Through the open window a wind blows ruffling her hair A
breeze floating through the room as --

INT WHITBY HOTEL - BEDROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT)

A breeze wafts through ruffling her hair awakening Maud
from her dream to hear Christabels voice half-dream
half-real

CHRISTABEL (05S)
Admit You know me

In pale dawn light Maud sees letters scattered over her
table Then over by the windowseat --

Christabel sits looking out head turned away hair blowing
in the breeze through the window sea spray crash on
rocks the water resembles flames of fire

Framed in the window with the ghost the reflection of the
leaping flames against her face Maud gets an epiphany --

MAUD
Oh my God Roland
INT WHITBY HOTEL - ROLANDS BEDROOM - DAWN

Roland awakes to KNOCKING at his door Groggily he gets up
goes to the door Opens it to see -- Maud

MAUD
My room Now

Maud returns swiftly Roland steps out warily wondering

INT WHITBY HOTEL - MAUDS BEDROOM - DAWN

Roland walks into Mauds room Sees her staring out of the
window For a moment he cant see anything He looks
closer at the window

MAUD
I saw her

ROLAND
Who

MAUD
Christabel

Maud moves closer to Roland Almost touching As Roland
sees traces of a reflection in the window He turns to her

MAUD
All my life since I was a child
Ive seen her But never with
anyone else You saw her didnt
you

ROLAND
Im not sure what I saw

MAUD
I saw Blanche that night in Lincoln
Thats why I wanted you to go I
thought it was a warning

ROLAND
And now
MAUD
I dont know You dont think Im
crazy --
ROLAND
No never Not much anyway
(MORE)

ROLAND (CONTD)
But two crazy people are no more use
than one We still have no proof

Now the ghost has vanished Maud can see out over the beach

MAUD
Look Out there

Roland squints his eyes Focuses out in the distance
waves crash upon rocky caverns sun scattering light like
flames

MAUD
You read Christabels poem about
Melusina --

ROLAND

But I never finished it
Maud moves closer to the window entranced by what she sees

MAUD
‘And where the water moved and
shook itself
A show of leaping flames of
tongues of light --

Roland moves towards her An idea

ROLAND
Wait Say it again Do it and
Ill recite a line from Ash
(as Maud protests)
Just do it --

Now inspired Roland starts Suspicious Maud carries on

ROLAND MAUD
Shall our hearths ash And where the water
grow pale or spark in moved and shook
waves-- itself--

FROM Rolands face PAN ONTO Maud

ROLANDMAUD
(together)
-- A show of leaping flames of
tongues of light
A fountain of cold fire self

renewed

Both amazed as the words coincide

ROLAND

The same lines Word for word
MAUD

They were here They saw it

together

They look out to sea In the window reflection flames
dance off waves as they crash against rocky caverns Roland
and Mauds faces together in the window

INT ASH FACTORY - BASEMENT - DAY

Inside his office Blackadder is hard at work on a footnote

of an Ash poem (Mummy Possesst) He looks up to see
Fergus Instinctively Blackadder puts a hand over his

writing

FERGUS
I was looking for Roland Michell

BLACKADDER
Hes on holiday He asked for a few
days off Never had a holiday
before now that I think of it --

FERGUS

Maybe this was personal I was
pretty sure Roland was onto
something about Christabel La
Motte

(as Blackadder

raises an eyebrow)
But it may have come to nothing Or
hed have told you

BLACKADDER
He probably would

FERGUS
Exactly
INT ROLAND AND VALS APARTMENT - DAY

Val is eating cornflakes CATS MEOWING The DOORBELL
RINGS She goes to answer it Its Fergus Wolf

FERGUS
Hello my dearest Is Roland in

VAL
No Hes gone away for a few days

FERGUS
What a pity I need to get in touch
with him rather urgently

VAL
He hasnt phoned I dont know when
hes back I havent been all that
nice to him

FERGUS
I see

VAL
I dont know what you see Fergus
You always see a bit more than there
is to see Whats up

FERGUS
Theres something going on I dont
understand Yet You dont happen
to know Maud Bailey

A silence Now Val is intrigued

VAL
I see He didnt tell me what he
was up to He knows Im not
interested But I did have a phone
number For emergencies

FERGUS
This could be an emergency

EXT SOHO STREETS (OUTSIDE LESCARGOT) - DAY

Outside a restaurant Mortimer Cropper walks with Hildebrand
Ash down the street When he hears a voice behind him

FERGUS
Professor Cropper --
(as Cropper and
Hildebrand turn
round)
Sorry to interrupt I was curious
if youd seen Roland Michell
recently
(MORE)

FERGUS (CONTD)
(beat catches his
breath)
I think he may have discovered
something A connection between Ash
and the poet Christabel La Motte

Hildebrand and Cropper exchange glances

CROPPER
How extraordinary We were just
discussing an enquiry about some
letters up in Lincoln --
(giving his full
attention)
You interest me Dr Wolf

Like a cat with the cream Fergus purrs quietly

INT SEAL COURT - DAY

THROUGH the kitchen window Sir George peers out from behind
the curtain to see a swanky Mercedes arrive outside the
house He goes into the hallway picks up his shotgun
and--

EXT SEAL COURT - DAY

Sir George aims his shotgun down its sights at Mortimer
Cropper standing by his Mercedes looking up at the house

SIR GHORGE
Who the hell are you

Cropper walks forward holding out his card
CROPPER
Professor Mortimer Cropper of the
Cropper Foundation Harmony City
New Mexico Ive come a long way--

Sir George doesnt take the card Still aims the gun

SIR GHORGE
Go away What do you want--

CROPPER
Dont shoot I never trouble the
truly reluctant I believe you may
be in possession of letters by
Randolph Henry Ash Have you any
idea of how much they would be
worth

SIR GEORGE
Worth

CROPPER
In money In money Sir George

Sir Georges brow creases with thought The gun lowers

SIR GHORGE
English things should stay in
England in my view--

CROPPER
Understandable An admirable
sentiment But these days how
relevant is sentiment

Cropper sees the gap leaps in He proffers Sir George his
card

EXT WHITBY SEASHORE - NEAR CAVERN - DAY

Roland and Maud at a rocky cavern they glimpsed from the
hotel Maud with scarf covering her hair suddenly seeing
Roland in a new light as she examines the distinctive
jet-black stones

MAUD
Look at these All shiny and black
No wonder Ash wrote about them

ROLAND
I wonder if they ever met again

MAUD
No one knows where Christabel went
when Blanche died She seems to
have vanished --

ROLAND
Then its hopeless We still need
to find real proof Ash and
Christabel were here together

MAUD
That could take weeks
(beat)
Will you be sorry to go back now

ROLAND
Will you

MAUD
I have the impression both of us
will be sorry

Maud looks up at Roland And as the sunlight reflects on
the stones in her hand --

DISSOLVE TO

FLASHBACK - EXT WHITBY SEASHORE (ROCKY CAVERN) - DAY

Stones in the hand of Christabel glinting Ash and
Christabel are in a cavern aglow with light Outside WAVES
CRASH against rocks as Christabel fills her basket with
jet-black stones In a playful light-hearted mood Ash
nuzzles close to her

CHRISTABEL
I shall take these home use them to
prop doors weigh down the sheets of
my poem--

Affectionately hands intertwined she teases him

ASH
Let me carry them back for you

CHRISTABEL
(laughingly)
I can carry my own burdens

ASH
Not while I am here--

Ash takes the basket She relents then suddenly her mood
shifts She looks away saddened as they head out onto the
rocks

CHRISTABEL
You know that after these few days
together --

ASH

Let us not think of time--

CHRISTABEL
We must part never look back It
is inevitable we both know it--

ASH
I cannot will not I love you--

CHRISTABEL
You speak to me of love You have a
wife sir Speak to me of her

In sudden fury the SEA CRASHES against rocks below
buffets them In anguish words stick in his throat
in his eyes

ASH

I have a wife and I love her
Not as I love you

(he stops unable

to go on)
There are good reasons why my love
for you need not hurt her I know
this must sound bald and lame It
must be what many men philandering
men have said before me I never
thought to find myself saying such
things Yet I believe what I have
said to be true I can never tire
of you-- of this--

CHRISTABEL

It is in our nature to tire
Fortunately Let us collude with
necessity Let us play with it

(beat)
And if we cannot make our sun
stand still yet we will make him
run

ASH
A poet after my own heart

CHRISTABEL
And mine Though not more beloved
than Randolph Henry Ash

She moves towards him They embrace passionately
pocket Christabel throws a paper out on the wind flying

away --

ASH
What is that

Wind
tears

From her

CHRISTABEL
A poem I was writing it here
ASH
Why-- You are not happy with
it
CHRISTABEL

These feelings-- I want them to
live forever To survive the few
days we have here

She trembles close to tears Ash takes her in his arms
And as the wild sea buffets the shore WAVES CRASHING
against rocks--

HOLD ON the scraps of paper as they fly on the wind PAST
the tide pools ACROSS the beach TOWARDS the seashore
where --

They scatter across two pairs of feet One in chic modern
sandals the other wearing old tennis shoes REVEAL --

END OF FLASHBACK

EXT WHITBY SHORELINE - DAY

Roland and Maud on the shore Reluctantly getting ready to
go

ROLAND
I dont know what will happen to me
when I get back Ive got no real
job And then theres Val Ive
lived with her since university I
owe her so much But it doesnt
work Not for any good reason But
because

MAUD

I had a relationship like that We
tormented each other One of those
people who as soon as you open your
mouth they say another cleverer
louder thing Quoting Freud at six
in the morning I felt battered
For no good reason

Roland sees Maud smiling Fiddling with her head scarf

ROLAND
Tell me-- Why do you always cover
your hair
MAUD

Its the wrong color No one
believes its natural Ata
conference once I got accused of
trying to please men So I cut it
off Now its grown I put it away

ROLAND
You shouldnt You should let it
out

MAUD

Why do you say that

ROLAND
Because if anyone cant see it they
think and think about it they
wonder what its like

MAUD
Do they
ROLAND
Yes Life is so short It has a

right to breathe

Suddenly Maud unties her head-square undoes the clips
slowly

MAUD
You are an odd man

ROLAND
Im not making a pass You know
that

MAUD
Yes I do Thats whats so odd

She puts down her head shakes it

ROLAND
That feels better

MAUD
All right That feels better

A moment between them Roland is drawn towards her But
up to the cliff Maud sees a familiar figure appear waving
at them

CROPPER
Hello down there--
Roland and Maud swivel round to see-- the urbane

silhouette of Mortimer Cropper walking towards them in the
sandy cove

CROPPER
At last Youre a hard pair to
track down --

ROLAND
How did you find us--

CROPPER
A little detective work Youre
forgetting 1 know our dear
Randolph better than any of you
Congratulations on your discovery
(beat)
Tea anyone

Cropper moves up to them with his sharks grin

INT HOTEL - TEA ROOM - DAY

Cropper pours tea for Maud Roland looks on Cropper is
charmingly proprietorial gleeful at his new possessions

MAUD
At least Sir George and Lady Joan
will get some money --

ROLAND
But have you read the letters

CROPPER

Thats not so important Ill be
sending them back to New Mexico for
safekeeping Poor Lord Ash found
the news very upsetting He had a
stroke --

(as Roland and

Maud react)
Hildebrand has stepped in to look
after the Ash estate

ROLAND
We cant prove it yet But we think
Ash and Christabel came here
Together --

CROPPER

Fascinating

(beat a grin)
Perhaps Perhaps not Of course
if something did develop between Ash
and Christabel Maud and I would be
the natural team to do the research
After all

(puts a proprietorial

arm around her)
We have a special relationship

Roland picks up the nuance Cropper turns to him

CROPPER
We already fund Mauds work And
with what I know about Ash I
dont think youll be needed Dr
Michell

Roland sits saying nothing Furious

CROPPER
Thanks for your time and energy Dr
Michell Im sure you understand

ROLAND
I understand

Roland looks at Maud like a rabbit in the headlights Says
nothing Roland gets up walks off in disgust Cropper
stops Maud following She turns to him

MAUD
Now you own the letters you can do
what you want -- why do you need me
CROPPER

My lawyer tells me Ash wrote a note
returning his letters to
Christabels possession A legal
technicality --

MAUD
You mean the letters could belong to
me

CROPPER
Open to dispute But Id hate to
see you waste money on law suits
So unnecessary

Maud pulls her hand away from Cropper
MAUD

I was worried you were being nice to
me How silly

INT ROLANDS ROOMCORRIDOR - DAY
Maud follows Roland up to his room She knocks on his door

MAUD
Roland let me in --

ROLAND (0S)
Go away --

Maud tries the door To her surprise its unlocked She
enters Finds Roland flinging his books and papers into a
bag

MAUD
Look at me Roland --

ROLAND
I can hear you fine --

MAUD
I cant back out of this The
center The students Thats my

ROLAND

Good Youre welcome to it --
MAUD

ROLAND

He wants to own everything Now he
does Including you --

MAUD
So what can we do If we had any
firm proof about Ash and Christabel

ROLAND
We could have carried on -- I cant
believe you expect me to listen to
Croppers bullshit -- when on top
of everything else -- you slept with
this this
cowboy --

Roland finishes his packing heads for the door

MAUD

Roland youre

ex-boyfriend of yours tells me Im

He kisses her hand Christabel gives a rueful smile

CHRISTABEL
I am sad we went walking sir

Christabel vanishes into the distance

Inside a studio a TV panel gets ready to debate the hot
literary news LEONORA STERN a loud energetic US feminist
sits next to Blackadder in the makeup chair while Cropper
and Hildebrand Ash sit under lights getting ready

Ready Professor Stern --
LEONORA

More blush deary I can take

As an interviewer announces a lead-in Leonora leans over
whispering to Blackadder hand poised on his thigh

LEONORA
Youve got to make your Mr Ash to
be the hottest property in town
Professor Get them by the balls
Give them one sexy thing youll do
fine--

BLACKADDER
One sexy thing Mmnnn

LEONORA

I love the way you talk By the

(hand on his thigh)
I take it neither of us want Cropper
to win this You may be interested
Professor I got a letter from a
research student in Brittany

INTERCUT WITH

The literary world has been

rocked by an extraordinary

discovery A panel of experts is

here to discuss
Alone in his apartment-- Roland glowering at the TV screen

A low moan The cats keep out of his way

INTERCUT WITH

INT LEONORAS APARTMENT - DUSK

Watching the same TV program like two lonely hearts Maud
sits on the sofa in Leonoras She uncovers a letter on a
table A French address catches her eye She reads it
avidly

MAUD

(reading aloud)

I am currently working on an
unpublished writer Sabine de
Kercoz and have discovered material
I believe will be of interest to
you Yours Dr Ariane Le

Maud flicks through Leonoras files Finds an address She
hesitates

INTERCUT between --

Roland Are you there
Roland I need to speak to you I
know you dont want to speak to
me But I think Ive found another
clue

CLICK -- the message breaks off

BACK TO TV
as each of the panel competes for 15 seconds of fame

LEONORA (V0)

Of course from a radical
feminist perspective it was a
surprise to learn Christabel might
have loved a man--

BLACKADDER (V0)
A complete shock Its as if wed
discovered Shakespeares Dark Lady -

CROPPER (V0)
I dont think we have to rush to
conclusions Nothing happened To
my eyes this correspondence was a
purely literary love affair Ash
was always a complex man This only
proves his moral stance as
exemplary Until Dr Fergus Wolf
and I examine the evidence--

BLACKADDER (V0)
Thats why the letters must stay in
our country as part of our
heritage --

PATEL (V0)
(to Hildebrand Ash)
With your father now ill doesnt
that question come to you

HILDEBRAND (V0)
After a hundred years some of
us feel the time is right to let Ash
enter the modern world --

Now is the time to bring other
valuable parts of Ashs legacy into
the public eye

A masked woman -- MRS HELLA LEES -- clad in jewels leads
him over towards --

MRS LEES
Gentlemen members of the Vestal
Lights let the seance begin

A circular table seven ladies four men they clasp hands
Ash takes a seat in the circle

MRS LEES
(to spirit world)
We are ready to receive you if your
spirit stands at the threshold we
ask you to reveal yourself Is
anybody there

Mrs Lees taps the table Ash scans the circle his eyes
hit those of a woman opposite A sharp intake of breath as

MRS LEES
I feel hands As cold as ice

The table vibrates Ash watches Mrs Lees shake
uncontrollably A spirit voice speaks through her --

MRS LEES
“Do not force me
(as herself)
Who is it
(as voice)
“Nobodaddy

Ash sees a halo of electromagnetic force like fire surround
Mrs Lees Suddenly Ash feels a TAPPING shake the table A
breeze lifts skirts Ash hears a WOMAN SOB then LAUGHTER

MRS LEES
There is a hostile presence in the
room Is there a spirit who wishes
to speak

The sound of RUNNING WATER Ash looks at the woman
opposite and recognizes Christabel who speaks in a
trance a spirit voice possesses her

Ql

CHRISTABEL
(in a spirit voice)
“Remember the stones
(in her own voice)
Where are you
(in the spirit
voice)
“I bring gifts

MRS LEES
She is possessed A spirit is with
us

Ash wants to go over to her But the circles hands hold
onto him He hears RUSHING WATER boom LOUDER then
sees --

A vision of a white hand carrying a white wreath hanging
from the chandelier by threads The circle clasps hands
again --

MRS LEES
Let her go the spirit has
entranced her Do not wake her

As Blanches spirit manifests itself --

MRS LEES
You bring a message of love

But an ELECTROMAGNETIC CURRENT CRACKLES holds Ashs hands
fast Ash struggles to get free --

ASH
I must speak

Ash moves towards Christabel But the wreath tangles him in
threads like a web He tries to break free but ghostly
hands wrap around his throat --

ASH
Away foul spirit I beg you --

Ash turns to see a ghostly face of Blanche In rage he
raises the wreath in his hands Mrs Lees pleads --

MRS LEES
-- Dont break the spell -- her
spirit will be harmed forever --

But Ash hurls the wreath away a SHRIEK as Blanches spirit

disappears Ash rushes at Christabel who almost faints in

her trance He holds her in his arms removes her mask --

ASH
Speak I beg you I came to
France you turned me away my
darling For Gods sake answer

tell me the truth I must know
Weeping Ash cradles Christabel in his arms
ASH
Where is she Is she not dead
Tell me Tell me what you have
done

Ash bends to hear Christabels whisper

CHRISTABEL
You have made me a murderess

Christabel collapses Guests try to pull Ash away from her
He howls in pain and rage --

ASH
Dead No-o-o0 --

Ash pushes over a candle flame which spills over Mrs
Lees comes to her senses

The photocopier is a great
democratic invention no

As Le Minier talks Maud stares through windscreen wipers
in a blur of rain and glass she suddenly sees --

HER POV - AT SIDE OF ROAD

Two bedraggled figures one of them Christabel distressed
and crying holding out her hands Maud focusses on her as
the CAR ZOOMS past -- Their eyes meet -- as --

Rain pours down Le Minier sets Maud down nearby her hotel
in a provincial seaside town near a sandy bay and dark sea
As Maud runs to the entrance she sees someone sheltering

from the elements Hunched over slumped drenched by rain

On closer inspection she sees -- Roland Shocked at first
she warms to a smile As Roland looks up anorak collar
pulled up And through the rain they rush together throw
arms round each other Then slowly pull apart --

Of course we are mad

Roland pauses as if about to say something important And
sneezes

of rage --

MAUD
Or grief He believed Christabel
was responsible for someones death
The question is -- “Who

ROLAND
Blanche of course You said no one
knew where Christabel was when
Blanche committed suicide

MAUD
Until now Thats what I found from
Leonoras letter Christabel had
family in Brittany A young cousin
who wrote a journal A French
researcher found fragments of poems
by Christabel dated Spring 1860
This is where she was Until now
nobody knew

Maud takes the towel rubs Rolands hair dry

ROLAND
I wish nobody knew where I was

MAUD
Me too Ive lied shamelessly to
Leonora I even stole Dr Le
Miniers address

ROLAND
All scholars are a bit crazy

Roland sneezes blows his nose Hes in a bad way his
towel like a turban balanced on his head

MAUD
Roland you said Ash came to France
When exactly --

ROLAND
Spring 1860

MAUD
Exactly

ROLAND
Around March

MAUD

So think about it Roland
(Roland is blank)

How long is that after Ash and

Christabel were in Whitby

Under his turban Roland does his sums Maud knows the
answer

Suddenly they freeze In the lobby of the hotel they see

Leonora Stern with Blackadder canoodling fondly

Oh no

IN LOBBY
Roland and Maud overhear Leonora with Blackadder

LEONORA
I dont understand why Maud dashed
off without a word That letter
from Le Minier was mine after all
We were good friends

Perhaps your Roland Michell is some
kind of macho boss-man

BLACKADDER
Hes not forceful Its his major
failing

LEONORA

Then it must be love

BACK ON STAIRS
Maud and Roland sneak back to their room

MAUD
Should we go and confront them

Maud puts out both her hands Roland takes them

muted Neither can sleep

I feel sad about Christabels

ROLAND

We dont know it was dead

MAUD
I cant help thinking if it
wasnt destined to die why did she
run away Why didnt she stay where
she was safe

ROLAND
Maybe she meant no one to know what
happened Not even us
Roland turns toward Maud Who is still turned away

Roland puts his hand on Mauds looks directly at her His

ROLAND
I think Ive lost everything Ive
ever had or cared about Ash My

She walked out I should feel
frightful But if I had to tell the
truth

(beat)
I want that life Maud Ash and

admit it

Silence overtakes them

wanted the empty room

ROLAND
I did Now Im not so sure

MAUD
No please -- I cant -- I dont
want to lose myself Do you
understand how important that is

ROLAND
Yes -- but -- to live life so
powerfully Does anyone do that

the sample Yet his mind is on something else He gets up
moves behind her Ellen stops

ASH
Ellen I have something I must tell
you

Ellen turns to him Ash pauses then words tumble out

ASH
For the last year I have been in
love with another woman I could
say it was a sort of madness A
possession as by demons A kind of
blinding At first it was only
letters -- and then -- in Yorkshire
-- I was not alone --

ELLEN
I know

Ellen looks up at Ash his proud crest fallen

ASH
How long

ELLEN
I was told I had a visitor

Ellen unlocks a drawer Brings out the original copy of
Ashs poem in an envelope addressed to Miss La Motte
Bethany

ELLEN

The original version of your poem
Certain passages are superior I
think to what you now have here

I sensed a new inspiration A muse
As I would care to inspire you were
I a poet

Maud sits down with Roland now surrounded by Beatrice and
Maud

BEATRICE
I dont know what to do They all
dislike me so -- they think Ellens
diary is unimportant Ive been
thinking

Ellen wrote to baffle us

ROLAND
What do you mean

BEATRICE

She wrote so much To throw us off
the scent

(beat)
I believe she must have known if
there was a child what happened
to it How it died Thats why she
buried the truth in a box

From a leather portfolio Beatrice removes an old scrap of
paper

BEATRICE

She left this scrap of paper in her
desk when she died Im sure Ellen
knew the scavengers would come --
sooner or later

(reciting from memory)
“What shall I be without you
My Randolph now is gone

Beatrice stands in front of the glass cases from inside
Roland and Maud hear a FLUTTERING sound As if the
BUTTERFLIES are suddenly alive fluttering wings trying to
escape as --

With Maud he follows Beatrice towards the old bedroom

Follow me

Beatrice walks into the old bedroom past the glass cases
and portraits the aquarium and books of the first dreamlike
shot --

As if Beatrice has become Ellens ghost

Ellen leans over her dying husband Ash lies in bed
propped up on pillows He is dying

ASH
Forty-four years with no anger I
do not think many husbands and wives
can say as much
(beat)
It cannot be helped Do you think
after death we continue

Ellen bows her head begins to weep

ASH
Do not cry I am not sorry I have
not -- done nothing you know I

have lived

Ellen sees Ash clutching in his hand a gold pocket watch a
long plaited chain of gold hair tied around it

ASH
Do not let me be picked by vultures
Burn what they should not see

Ellen unwinds her hair from his hands A KNOCK at the door
As she gets up to go Ash moans deliriously --

ASH
Summer fields in a twinkling of
an eye I saw her I should have
looked after her How could I I
could only hurt her

ELLEN
You saw who In the summer fields
You saw who Randolph

ASH
(after a pause)
I forgot

Ash falls back asleep his hand clutches the watch with the
golden hair which Ellen will also later bury Ellen goes to
the door opens it to a doctor As he enters Ellen turns
back --

To look at her husband -- a moan as she sees he is --

Dead A wind blows her candle smoke past tearful eyes

INT ASH HOUSE (RUSSELL SQUARE) - LATER THAT NIGHT

ON a ROARING FIRE flames burn up papers Ellen watches
throws more on At her husbands desk --

ELLEN
What shall I be without you

(NOTE The one Roland and Maud now read lies on the desk)
She takes a packet of letters tied with ribbons She
hesitates

Instead of throwing them on the fire Ellen walks toward a
box

ELLEN (V0)
-- My Randolph now is gone
Tomorrow we will set out together on
his last blind journey

She unlocks the box removes an envelope addressed to
Randolph Ash The broken seal recognizable as
Christabels a crest of arms a shield held up by a
unicorn and centaur

Ellen goes to the bed-stand a pocket watch with a plait of
golden hair wrapped around the chain-ring

ELLEN (V0)
And these letters and mementoes
-- why do I choose to put them up
in their sealed enclosure

On the desk beside Ellens note an open box S5he
hesitates holding the letters in her hand then --

EXT CEMETERY - DAY As in the opening -- the same box Closed and sealed in
Ellens hands PULL BACK to reveal mourners in black
Ellen walks forward with the box --

ELLEN (V0)
I want them to have a sort of
duration A demi-eternity

Places the box in the mausoleum near Ashs coffin

ELLEN (V0)
And if the seekers dig them out
again

On cue the GATES CLOSE WITH a THUD The box now locked and
sealed in the mausoleum --

ELLEN (V0)
Then justice will perhaps be
done to her when I am not here to
see it

END OF FLASHBACK

In the shadowy twilight Beatrice looks out from the
darkness She takes back her precious note from Roland and
Maud

ROLAND
Justice will perhaps be done to
her Who did she mean
BEATRICE

Ive asked myself that question all
these years A scholars
lifetime

MAUD
If Cropper digs it up he can keep
the truth hidden forever

ROLAND
So what can we do Wed need to
catch him in the act --

BEATRICE

Or get to the box before him --
ROLAND

You mean break in to the tomb

BEATRICE
I know it sounds barbaric

MAUD
This note youve shown us -- no one
else has seen it

BEATRICE
(shaking her head)
No one else has asked They dont
think Ellen is important But you
see She is

Roland looks at Maud an unaccustomed glint in his eye

ROLAND
Then we need to go now

village church Beneath a large tree the dark shape of a
Mercedes Trunk open with Cropper and Hildebrand
inspecting lights shovels ropes

HILDEBRAND
I suppose we could leave false
clues Blame it on the Satanists
A black mass or something

Hildebrand snorts with laughter Cropper frowns

CROPPER
I am not a common thief Its only
that box -- the thought of it
decaying in the ground -- the
thought of perhaps never
knowing --

He closes the trunk Cropper and Hildebrand walk over to
the inn and enter VOICES CARRYING OVER inside --

EXT ROADS TO CEMETERY - NIGHT

On hilly roads Maud drives her car through thickening mist
Roland at her side They pass the trip in silence each
waiting for the other to speak

MAUD
You packed the things

ROLAND
Sure
MAUD
The crowbar
ROLAND
Yes The crowbar
MAUD
We might need it Arent you

worried --

Maud glances over towards him her excitement palpable
Then -- she swerves to avoid a truck Roland winces sighs

ROLAND
I dont worry about anything Not
now At the moment I feel all --
clear in the head -- if you know
what I mean

They sit in silence as she zooms down a narrow side street
through the fog Then down a steep hill with trees on both
sides

MAUD
Roland Im sorry how it turned out
ROLAND
For who
MAUD
You And me I think I was afraid
ROLAND
I dont think so Not you Of

MAUD

Of falling in love with you

ROLAND

ROLAND
No Too complicated I cant think

The fog grows thicker as if theyre driving back in
time --

FOOTSTEPS A hand KNOCKS on a door Three knocks

Mrs Ash

END OF FLASHBACK

RETURN TO

EXT ROADS NEAR CEMETERY - NIGHT

Roland slams on the brakes Swirling fog clears to reveal -

A hound like Christabels companion from Seal Court in the
road The animal vanishes behind another cloud of fog
Roland and Maud drive slowly forward The fog grows more
misty --

COVERING the SCREEN as we --

RETURN TO

FLASHBACK - INT ASHS HOUSE - DAY The same hand KNOCKING on the door Details become clearer
as we REVEAL Again the KNOCKING A hushed servants
voice

MAID (0S)
Mrs Ash a letter

Sound of RAIN ON GLASS HORSES HOOVES ON COBBLESTONES
The door opens to reveal Ellen facing her young MAID

MAID
A lady called Miss La Motte came to
the door She gave me this letter
for your husband She said it was
very important

Ellen takes an envelope from the girls hand closes the
door
lll
CLOSEUP - LETTER

The coat of arms from Seal Court In Christabels
handwriting To Randolph Henry Ash Esq -- Most Urgent
And her name From Christabel La Motte Seal Court
Lincolnshire

Ellen takes the letter Slowly softly she walks into the

BEDROOM

Where Ash lies in bed deathly ill As Ellen picks up the
letter she holds it to her unable to let it go --

Poised over a candles flame --

EXT INN (NEAR CEMETERY) - NIGHT (PRESENT)
Peering through the bar window Roland sees Cropper eating

and drinking with Hildebrand and Fergus He sneaks back to
Maud standing by Croppers Merc

ROLAND
Theyre all there Cropper
Hildebrand even Fergus

MAUD
Roland did you bring a knife

ROLAND
Yes Do you need it

MAUD
Yes I do

Roland brings out a knife from his bag Without warning
Maud takes it over to the Merc stabs one tire Then the
other AIR RUSHES OUT The TIRES PUNCTURE fast

MAUD
All right -- shall we

Roland stares at Maud and the knife Both is disbelief

EXT CEMETERY - NIGHT

Maud and Roland pull up on the hill near the cemetery gates
On the gates a sign STRICTLY NO ADMITTANCE Nearby a
large wall where they place a ladder

Up over the wall into the cemetery they go

Walking through the graveyard round long curved avenues of
the necropolis As if from the tombstones and graves
voices fill the air

CHRISTABEL (V0)
My dear my dear

HOLD ON Roland and Maud as they disappear up the hill into
the gloomy darkness among the trees waving in the breeze

INT CEMETERY - NIGHT
Near the mausoleum the tomb awaits the box inside

CHRISTABEL (V0)
I ask for your forgiveness for
intruding on you at this time I am
told you are gravely ill

INSIDE CABINET

HOLD ON the letter its flap of envelope open We hear a
voice MOVE TOWARDS it until white paper FILLS the SCREEN

CHRISTABEL (V0)
I have writ down some things I
dearly wish you should know

FLASHBACK - INT SEAL COURT - DAY As in Roland and Mauds earlier journey we CLIMB UP --

A winding spiral staircase leading to a tower bedroom walls
now freshly-pained Christabels dolls -- where Maud and
Roland find the letters a century later -- kept neatly on
their bed

A woman sits at her desk talking softly as she composes a
letter It is Christabel now an old woman in her 60s

CHRISTABEL

I sit here like an old witch in
a tower You will say to me it
should have been told twenty-eight
years ago I know -- I have known
for these many years -- that 1 have
done you wrong Yet my guilt for
all that happened made it
impossible

Christabel drifts to the window Golden summer sun floods
in

CHRISTABEL
The truth is that you have a
daughter who is well and married
and the mother of a wonderful boy

She looks down from her isolation onto the grass knoll
below so well-kept in its day A beautiful woman in her
late 20s MAIA BAILEY plays with her baby boy

CHRISTABEL
She is beautiful and called
Maia and resembles I think both
her parents neither of which she
knows to be her parents

Christabel turns from the window lost in her memories

FLASHBACK - EXT FIELD (BRITTANY) - NIGHT Christabels memories We are FLYING OVER rugged winter
terrain before a farmhouse TOWARDS a barn in Brittany
decades ago

CHRISTABEL (V0)

We agreed to leave each other
and never look back And for
prides sake and yours I resolved
to keep my side of it When I
discovered my condition Blanche and
I quarrelled bitterly I could not
come to you So I made arrangements
-- I found a place to go in France -
- but you came searching after
me

The doors of the barn open for us and we CREEP PAST cows
and mules that stare TOWARDS us

CHRISTABEL (V0)
So I fled I fled

We REACH a haystack in the back where the squatting
Christabel trembles in agony CIRCLE AROUND we see her

sweat-drenched face

CHRISTABEL (V0)
I concluded that no decent
refuge remained fit for me

She opens her mouth to scream as --

INT CHRISTABEL AND BLANCHES HOUSE (RICHMOND)
CHRISTABEL (V0)

And when I thought of poor
Blanche

INT SITTING ROOM

Alone Blanche sewing pockets of a dress stones (from
Whitby) expertly bound with needle and thread

ON TABLE
A suicide note in Blanches writing placed on a desk To
whom it may concern Weighed down by a stone

EXT THAMES RIVER - CHELSEA BRIDGE
Upon a bridge Blanche looks into swirling waters of a dark
river In her pockets silvery-black stones sewn in by
thread As she walks to the precipice of the bridge and
jumps --

CHRISTABEL (V0)
I knew I had killed her

UNDERWATER

At the bottom of the river Blanche tumbles bubbles slowly
expiring from her mouth Her body weighed down by the
fossil stones she floats eerily in the cold darkness

CHRISTABEL (V0)
I could not face the world
Nor you

EXT CLIFFS (BRITTANY)
In a dark cloak Christabel alone facing out to sea At
her lowest ebb Distraught tears streaming down her
cheeks

CHRISTABEL (V0)
I felt haunted cursed and
alone

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO

INT SEAL COURT - CHRISTABELS ROOM - DAY Despite the memory Christabels face is calm and peaceful
CHRISTABEL (V0)
So I gave dear Maia to my

sister Sophie Bailey who brought
her up as her own

Christabel wanders into the shadows of her room which are
covered with stacks of papers A lifetime of words

CHRISTABEL (V0)

Now I want to make amends let
these ghosts rest in peace I have
flown about the battlements of this
stronghold crying on the wind of my
need to see and feed and comfort my
child who knows me not and -- to
whom can I say this but you -- who
loves me not

She returns to the window

CHRISTABEL (V0)
And yet she is so happy Ah
but if you were here you would see
how I dare not disturb her peace

CLOSEUP ON YOUNG MATAS FACE

She looks up perhaps her eyes meet Christabels But the
young mother quickly averts them

CHRISTABEL (V0)
I have been angry for so long -
- with all of us with you with
Blanche with my poor self and
now near the end I think of you
with clear love

She moves to her desk signs her name to the letter then
picks up a small art-nouveau picture frame She removes the
photo

CHRISTABEL (V0)
I send you her picture She
will have nothing of her strange
name and prefers to be called May
which suits her

CLOSEUP ON PHOTO

of a woman on her wedding day Original of the photo on
Mauds mantelpiece her great-great-grandmother May

CHRISTABEL (V0)

Did we not -- did you not
flame and I catch fire Is that
not fine Shall we survive and rise
from our ashes

ON CHRISTABELS FACE

as she prepares to part with her photo A burst of sunshine
surges through the window

She is consumed in white As the light slowly fades we
HOLD ON photo but now its old faded and in muddy hands

END OF FLASHBACK

DISSOLVE THROUGH and REVEAL --

EXT CEMETERY - DAWN

Rain starts The sun is about to rise Roland and Maud sit
at the graveyard by the mausoleum On the ground --

MAUD
(reading letter)
And so in the calm of mind
all passion spent I thank God --
if there must be a dragon -- that he
was you

The box has been opened the letter (with crest) sits out of
its envelope photos in their hands watch with its braided
lock of golden hair Roland holds it against Mauds own
hair

ROLAND
Its her May She was

MAUD
My great-great-grandmother yes
May

ROLAND

Now I know why they left all this --
the clues the poems the letters
They wanted you to know Maud They
left them for you

Holding the old crumpled pictures of May Maud is overcome

MAUD
She looks like Christabel You can
see it

ROLAND

She looks like you She looks like
Randolph Henry Ash too

MAUD
So I look like Ash

A hint of lightness Roland smiles gently touches her
face

ROLAND
I would never have thought of it
But yes -- here at the corner of

the eyebrow -- the edge of the mouth

MAUD
Now you see it youll always see it

ROLAND
Ill never be free of it

MAUD
No Well never be free

Maud smiles too looks up at Roland as if for the first
time Roland reaches out to her holds her close to him

ROLAND
Maud I love you so much

The ice queen melts Maud buries her face tears fall

ROLAND
I just love you Thats how it is

Maud raises her arms to him his hands stroke her wet hair
tracing the curves of her shivering body As --

MAUD
The worst possible way then

They pull away for an instant

ROLAND
Yes total obsession The worst

They move closer Roland knows her heart is barely
triumphing over her fear Fighting every inch of the way
Maud softly brings her lips to his A heartbeat away from
a

Long lingering kiss Until --

Maud opens her eyes looks up slowly And behind Roland
sees -- over the brow of the hill a familiar figure

Beatrice Smiling white hair streaming in the rain
Roland swivels around to see --

A gathering crowd of sodden desperate scholars Beatrice
Cropper Hildebrand Fergus gloomy ever Blackadder and
Leonora

INT INN (NEAR CEMETERY)

RAIN POURS down In the bar around a fireplace a muddy
crew of scholars in pajamas and dressing gowns drink hot
toddies Blackadder and Leonora hold hands in love
Beatrice passes around the letters

BLACKADDER
How strange for Maud to be descended
from both Ash and Christabel

FERGUS
Yes Your lives work all in
vain

CROPPER

No no I sensed it all along The
old Cropper instinct I knew it was
something vast

BEATRICE
I can imagine Ellen She didnt
even read it Just put it away --
BLACKADDER
For Maud As it turns out She
preserved it for Maud

BEATRICE
Poor Ash He never knew never
knew

Looking to Leonora for once speechless gazing at a damp
letter

LEONORA
Wow

PULL BACK from the discussion -- TO upstairs -- where --

INT INN (NEAR CEMETERY) - ROOM
THROUGH the windows of the 18th Century inn --

In a white room with a white four-poster with white-veiled
curtains Maud and Roland by a white bed

ROLAND
Im afraid of it too Just like
you
MAUD
What cowards we are after all
(beat)
Kiss me
ROLAND

Thats what I was afraid of

Behind the white veils Maud finally kisses Roland softly
at first then with all her repressed passion as they lie
down upon the bed --

DOWN BY BED - BOX

And beside it -- the WATCH With its plait of golden hair
where we HOLD for a moment Until weakly fitfully the
sweeping second-hand gasps out a few inexplicable TICKS --
enough to let us know --

It is alive

ASH (V0)
There are things that happen and
leave no discernible trace are not
spoken of or written of as though
such things have never been Two
people met on a hot May day and
never mentioned the meeting

DISSOLVE TO

FLASHBACK - EXT MEADOW (SEAL COURT) - DAY The same WATCH TICKING

In the hands of a man walking down a country lane on a hot
May day of bright sunlight and BUZZING INSECTS Nearby a
meadow full of flowers like a Monet blue cornflowers
scarlet poppies a carpet of yellow daisies sway in the
breeze

Up a lane walks a bearded man in a black wide-brimmed hat
From cool shadows he stares wistfully out in the distance
at -- the gothic towers of Seal Court The old man is hot
wipes his brow

As he catches his breath a nearby CREAKING sound to and
fro distracts him Yet so intense is his stare he hardly
notices a young GIRL swinging on a gate

GIRL
Hello Are you lost

The Girl in blue dress and white pinafore hums to herself
making a daisy chain The man looks down at her he is
Ash

ASH
Am I -- Oh hello Yes I was
looking up at yonder house Do you

know it
GIRL
That house Of course I do Thats
my house
ASH
(beat)

Is it really

Suddenly curious Ash cocks his head towards her lowers
himself on one knee A gentle matter-of-fact tenderness

ASH
Well you are a very fortunate girl
(holding out his
hand)
My name is Randolph Ash How do you
do May I know yours

GIRL (MAY)
My name is May Bailey I have
another name also but I do not like
it

lel

ASH
I think I know your mother You
have a true look of your mother

MAY
No one else says that I think I
look like my father

ASH
I think you have a look of your
father too

Ash puts his arms around her waist lifts her down to his
side Mays sits pulling grass surrounded by a cloud of
butterflies

ASH

You seem very happy
MAY

Oh yes I am I an

(beat)
Can you make daisy chains

ASH
I will make you a crown for a May
Queen But you must give me
something in exchange

MAY
I havent got anything to give

ASH
Oh just a lock of hair To
remember you by

MAY
Like a fairy story

ASH
Just so

Ash hunts in his satchel takes out a tiny pair of pocket
scissors And very gently cuts a long lock from her golden
hair

MAY
Here Ill plait it for you to
keep it tidy

Mays fingers set to work Ash gathers up twigs ferns
flowers

ASH
Ill make you a crown like a
fairys child Or like Proserpine
Do you know any poetry

MAY
I have an Aunt Christabel who is
always telling me poems But I
dont like poetry

ASH
I am sorry you dont like poetry as
I am a poet

MAY
Oh I like you You make lovely
things and dont fuss

ASH
If I wrote down a message would you
be kind enough to deliver it to your
aunt

MAY
A message What will it say

ASH
Simply that you met a poet who was
looking for his fairy goddess and
who met you instead and who sends
her his compliments and will not
disturb her and is on his way to
fresh woods and pastures anew

Ash locks into Mays eyes A moment he will remember with
absolute clarity but which will fade in her memory over the
years Tiny beetles crawl about their feet

They go back to working beneath the sun A man and a girl
content to share one moment of their lives As a breeze
floats through ruffling the leaves around them --

DISSOLVE TO

SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER

Ash stands by the gate watching May run through the meadow
note in hand daisy crown upon her head Ash winds her
blonde hair-plait around the chain of his watch

May climbs up a hill towards Seal Court where her brothers
ambush her They rough and tumble falling down the grassy
slope Her crown falls beneath one brother is crushed
Among her things May picks up her half-embroidered cushion
(the one Maud finds a hundred years on) with verses only
begun Ash turns away as --
HIS NOTE
without May even registering --
Flies from her hand up into the air Carried by the wind
like a leaf it floats through the fields Over the grass
connected by diamond-threads of light --
Over the yellow and purple flowers up into the branches of
a tree When a wind blows RUSTLING LEAVES seeming to play
music upon them HOLD ON the tree SLOW PAN THROUGH TO --

END OF FLASHBACK

EXT LONDON LIBRARY (ST JAMESS SQUARE) - DAY

That same tree A hundred years later Now full circle
growing magically in an elegant square in central London
As the WIND RUSHES through the branches in an ancient
harmony --

About to pluck from its branches to tap upon a library
window --

Leaves floating like birds

FADE TO BLACK

THE END
