EXT WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

On a deserted rain slicked street FRANK CASTLE watches a
heavy equipment warehouse thirty yards down the road through
the windshield of a non-descript vehicle parked in the
shadows His partner JAKE BERKOWITZ slightly rumpled
Slightly older dozes next to him Castle extracts a
package from a paper sack and begins to unwrap it Inside
is a beautifully prepared meal complete with napkin and
utensils Mischievously Castle crumbles the wrapping paper
loudly Berkowitz wakes and squints over at him
malevolently as Castle pretends to go about his business

CASTLE
Good morning Princess

Berkowitz grumbles looking at his watch

BERKOWITZ
Three oclock They were supposed
to be here two hours ago I dont
know why they call them organized
crime The assholes are never on
time for anything

He looks at Castle eating not with a little envy He pulls
a soggy paperbag out from under his seat and extracts a
leaky cup of coffee and a soggy sandwich

CASTLE
Why do you eat like that

BERKOWITZ
Because Im a bachelor thats
why I dont have someone in
my life who loves me enough to
prepare gourmet fucking meals
everytime I go on a stake out

CASTLE
Yes you do

Castle takes another package out of his bag and hands it to
Berkowitz Berkowitz beams and tosses his soggy fare out
the window He bites into a wedge of pie

BERKOWITZ
Shes too good for you You
know that
CASTLE
(warm)
Yeah I do

A car pulls up to the warehouse Two men get out and enter
the warehouse One carries a suitcase

CASTLE
Rock-n-roll

Castle is out of the car in a flash gun in hand Berkowitz
stuffs the rest of the pie into his mouth and follows

CUT TO

INT WAREHOUSE

Heavy machinery stands like dinosaurs in the shadows Ina
small lit area in the middle of the room seven men stand
around a table on which the open suitcase sits filled with
clear plastic bags of white powder The two men who brought
the bag visibly anxious watch as the CHEMIST checks the
powder for purity with a test kit Their eyes flick from
the test to the four men across from them Three thugs BIG
LOU TOUGH TONY and FRANKIE THE FIST flanking their boss
an extremely stylishly dressed impeccably coiffed hood
DAPPER DINO MORETTI The Chemist looks at Moretti and
shakes his head

CHEMIST
Only sixty percent pure

COURIER NO 1
Thats impossible Do it again

Morettis expression doesnt change

MORETTI
Wheres the other forty percent

COURIER NO 2
This thing is off

As he goes to grab the test kit he accidently gets some
white powder on Morettis suit sleeve Everyone freezes
Moretti stares at the spot as if it were an anathema to his
very soul

COURIER
(nervous)
Sorry Mr Moretti
Moretti looks at his thugs In a flash they grab the two
men and force their right hands onto the table

COURIER
Hey What are you doing Hey

Moretti picks up a steel bar and viciously smashes it across
each mans hand twice The men shriek Moretti wags a pipe
under their pain contorted faces

MORETTI
(calm)
Monday a hand Tuesday an arm
Wednesday a head I want my
other forty percent Understand

He taps the first mans chin with a pipe The man nods

MORETTI
And if you ever get me dirty
again you son-of-a-bitch your
wifes a widow

CASTLE (VO)
Dont move police

Everyone turns to Castle on one end and Berkowitz on the
other end of the room guns raised jumping from behind the
heavy equipment The thugs pull their guns and start
firing Castle and Berkowitz take cover and fire back Two
thugs go down the others head for cover Moretti grabs the
suitcase of dope

The gun battle ensues with shots ringing off metal Castle
is stalking around a piece of equipment when he sees two
thugs sighting up Berkowitz who has the couriers and the
chemist cornered Thinking quickly Castle notices that the
men are moving in front of a frontlcoader Castle hops from
where he is perched right into the drivers seat He hits
the starter button the thugs hear the sound turn just in
time to see Castle bearing down on them with the
frontloader Castle scoops them up and tosses them into the
dump truck He smiles and waves at Berkowitz A shot pings
next to his head Berkowitz fires shooting an assailant who
has snuck up behind Castle Castle jumps down

CASTLE
Wheres Moretti

BERKOWITZ
I dont know
A noise across the way turns Castle His POV Moretti
with the suitcase running into a maze of machinery

CASTLE
Stay here

Castle rushes off He races through the maze of machinery
trading shots with Moretti trying to cut him off from the
rear door The two men duck and dodge using the machinery
to their best advantage Moretti circles around behind
Castle and hits a switch A derrick drops its bucket just
above where Castle is standing Castle jumps out of the way
not a moment too soon losing his gun The bucket hits the
floor missing him by inches as he springs back up His
POV Moretti about to reach the door Castle looks
around He cannot reach Moretti in time and his gun is
lost Thinking quickly he grabs a block and tackle and
swings it for all he is worth It misses its mark but not
by much hitting the suitcase which flies apart White
powder rains on Moretti He glares at Castle and runs
through the exit door By the time Castle exits the
streets are deserted He stares up the streets a hunter
thwarted the rain running down his resolute face

chopper Castle has his auto shotgun slung over his back
and a 09mm pistol stuck in his waistband

CASTLE

Youve done your fair share

Castle disappears into the shadows Shake looks around a

out a pair of bifocals and a tattered copy of Backstage and
begins reading the classifieds A black-gloved pair of arms
grabs Shake from behind and yanks him into the shadows

INT LUMBER YARD

Castle stalks through the lumber yard cautious in the eerie
Silence His senses keen and alert A slight noise from
behind spins him shotgun at the ready There is nothing
All of a sudden a brace of lumber from above him comes
sliding off a second story shelf Castle dives up a small
aisle The boards hit the aisle supports breaking them
More lumber starts to fall

Castle rolls and runs losing his shotgun staying only a
few inches ahead of the avalanche of wood Bullets begin to
spatter all around him and hell breaks loose Castle turns
the corner Two Yakuza jump out with automatic guns

Castle hits a board sticking out of the pile it swings back
into the Yakuza knocking them over Castle pulls a pistol
out of his belt and pops up another aisle Shots drive him
back He spins and fires up A body falls from above
Castle runs A Yakuza jumps him from behind He flips the
man over and smashes his chest with an elbow crushing his
sternum As Castle is about to head for the exit another
blazing gun blocks his way He sprints up another aisle
As he turns the corner a hand grabs his arm He is flung
into a sheaf of boards Tomio kiais loudly and attacks with
a large punch Castle ducks The punch smashes through the
beam behind him cracking it with awesome force Tomio
charges again Castle blocks his punch and is cracked with
a backhand so strong it sends him spinning Tomio jumps up
and goes to stop Castle Castle rolls out of the way at the
last moment grabs a 2x4 and rises to face Tomio

His POV To the left a board holding back a stock of
2x4s Tomio charges Castle swings knocking the board
away The 2x4s fall on Tomio burying him Castle runs
for the exit and almost makes it but Sato jumps out and
fires an uzi across his path Castle takes off running
through the stacks of lumber drawing fire from all sides
He swings onto a hoist and takes off sailing over the fence
landing outside the yard He slams the door as the Yakuza
charge firing and bolts it with a thick board

He runs for his motorcycle across the street Shake is
nowhere to be found The Yakuza across the way pound on the
door Castle mounts his chopper and takes off

CLOSE UP a hand swings a chain with a grappling hook The
hook flies through the air and lands in Castles spokes

The bike upends Castle flies off into a bunch of empty
wooden crates When he rises the smallest black clad
figure is walking towards him masked but for the eyes
Castles hand imperceptively grabs a wooden dowel Waiting
feigning incapacity until the black clad figure is almost
upon him He springs swinging with the dowel The Yakuza
grabs his arm and flips him over effortlessly Castle rolls
out The Yakuza attacks Castle barely gets out of the
way He grabs the Yakuza by the shoulder and goes to flip
him around but a wheel kick spins before he can catching
him in the jaw Stunned another wheel kick drives him to
his knees Castle attempts to get up He is kicked again
and again The other Yakuza come bursting out of the
warehouse Castles vision blurs as the Yakuza come running
up

His assailant spins again kicking him in the head He
falls to his knees His POV before he fades to
blackness The Yakuza removes the mask It is Tanakas
daughter A final wheel kick sends Castle spinning into
darkness

FADE OUT

Castles vision clears His POV as the haze lifts He
is strapped to a rack-like device with bright lights

overhead and darkness beyond Sato Tomio and Tanakas

daughter look down at him A moment later Tanaka comes into

view holding a remote control device in her hand

TANAKA

That was a very expensive
question you asked in our
place the other night It
cost us nearly two million
dollars in cash How much
pain do you think that buys
you

CASTLE
Is the question true or false
or multiple choice

TANAKA
Neither

She hits a button on the remote control device The rack
creaks back stretching Castles every body fiber to the
breaking point She releases the button the machine
relaxes Castle goes limp panting with the pain

TANAKA
Who sent you

CASTLE
Nobody

Tanaka hits the switch again Castle screams in pain

TANAKA
Do you get the impression
I dont believe you

Castle looks her in the eye hard

CASTLE
Do you think I give a shit

She presses the button again for an even longer time
Castle seems about to come apart at every seam She takes
her finger off the button

TANAKA
You handle your own pain very
well Lets see how well you
handle the pain of others

Sato forces Castles head to the side Castles POV A
light goes on ten feet away Shake is tied to a similar
rack Tanaka hits the remote control Shake screams with
pain Castle flinches Tanaka observes

CASTLE
He has nothing to do with it

TANAKA
Then who does

CASTLE
I already told you

Tanaka sighs A very sadistic looking man ITO steps
forward Tanaka hands him the remote control device

TANAKA
I have an appointment Youll
be in good hands with Mr Ito
He can keep you alive much
- longer than youll want to be
I hope it wont come to that
Good bye

Tanaka exits with her escort leaving Ito and two other
Yakuza in attendance Ito addresses Castle in Japanese
Then hits the switch on Shake The old man is pulled beyond
endurance Blood begins to trickle from his mouth The
Yakuza go over and examine him with a stethoscope They
laugh Ito stretches him again slapping him awake

CLOSE UP

As he works them back and forth against the rope that binds
his hands to the rack His blood starts to flow
lubricating the bonds After a tortuous effort Castle
Slides mostly out of the rope

CASTLE
Okay Okay No more

The Yakuza turn around The power is turned off Shake who
slumps unconscious

CASTLE
Come here

Ito addresses the other Japanese The two of them stand on
either side of Castle their jackets off their shoulder
holsters in the open

CASTLE
(whispered
I got somethin to say

Castle pretends to be close to expiration The two Yakuza
bend forward

ITO
What you have to say

Castle whips his hands out from the bindings and pulls the
two pistols out of the shoulder holsters of the two startled
Yakuza He crosses his hands left over right

CASTLE
Sayonara

He pulls the triggers and blows both Yakuza away Ito goes
for his gun Castle shoots him in the arm with one gun and
shoots the rope binding his feet with the other Castle
hops off the rack and hoists Ito onto it tying him down

CASTLE
I dont want to stretch this
out so why dont you tell me
where the children are

Ito curses him in Japanese getting a little nervous about
the rack Castle picks up the remote control Ito eyes it
nervously steeling himself Castle pauses and then hits a
button Ito screams Castles face goes hard

CASTLE
I know you understand me You
dont tell me where the children
are I hit this button so hard
theyll find you in pieces like
chickens at the supermarket

Ito spits at Castle

CASTLE
Have it your way

Castle holds his finger on the button so long that Itos
muscles start coming away from his bones His flesh starts
to rend

ITO
Avenue A Avenue A

Castle releases the button He goes over to Shake and takes
the old man off the rack examining him Shake regains
consciousness

SHAKE
Go Take care of the children

CASTLE

First things first

He lifts Shake and starts to exit He looks back at Ito
His eyes harden He hits the button on the remote and
tosses it into the room closing the door on Itos hellish

To your new home

Tanaka pushes a button on a remote control A large black
glass descends covering a whole wall She pushes another
button The black glass is backlit turning into a map of
the world with red lights dotting large parts of Asia and a
few coastal areas of the Western Hemisphere

TANAKA
This is our empire

She hits another button Green lights dot throughout the
US and Canada

TANAKA
Soon this will be too and we
will need someone to run it
Someone who feels like them
but thinks like us I have
chosen that someone to be
you You will be sent to
Japan where your mind will
be trained shaped molded
until here

She taps her head

TANAKA

We will be the same You
will have more riches than
your father ever dreamed
of More power than he ever
knew existed You will be
the first American Yakuza
overlord

(pause)
