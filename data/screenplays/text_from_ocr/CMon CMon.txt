ROXANNE
Remember when your mom was dying
and we were on the phone all the
time and I didn’t even know you
were with her (OR and when Id
try to help you’d make me feel
stupid) Or when Luisa left and you
were ‘fine’ (He’s like you)

offers the interviewer access and a
reason to stay in a world not my
own complete distraction from my
own life a sense of invincibility
a sense on invisibility I traffic
and hope without the ability to
know what will happen in the
future The work offers the subject
a chance to speak of things they
have never spoken of A chance to
see themselves as subjects worthy
of time and attention The work
offers the subjects the creation of
an image of self the distributions
of which they cannot control ona
global scale in perpetuity

turned her sadness into some scary
problem just like our parents did

never did loved her I don’t get
him and she’s probably right

hands to make sounds and form
words Slowly you will learn to
take care of yourself Here it is
still and peaceful but there

the colors sensations and sounds
will wash over you constantly

You will see so many living things-
plants and animals beyond
imagining Here it is always

the same but there everything is
in motion Everything is always
changing You will be plunged into
earth’s river of time There will
be so much for you to learn and so
much for you to feel - pleasure and
fear joy and disappointment
sadness and wonder In your
confusion and delight you will
forget where you came from You
will grow up travel work perhaps
have children of your own
