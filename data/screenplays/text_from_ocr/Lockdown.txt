EXT LERNER HOUSE - MORNING

A dismal all white winter sky TILT DOWN TO--

A quiet working class house A rake beside a pile of
dead leaves

INT LERNER HOUSE - MORNING

KATE LERNER 16 ponytail Neat clean clothes Making
eggs and coffee

BETH LERNER Kate’s mother enters Tying her pink robe
Squinting through a red wine hangover adjusting tousled
hair Beth sits down at the table holds her coffee with
both hands

Kate sets the plate of breakfast in front of her mother
BETH
(pushing it away)
Thank you honey but I can’t eat a thing

Kate places two ASPIRIN and an ICE PACK on the table
Beth smiles at her daughter

BETH
What would I do without you

Beth gulps down the pills Puts the ice pack over her
eyes Kate kisses her mother on the head Walks down the
hall

BETH (0S)
Did you eat Kate Kate

KATE
Yeah

Kate knocks on a door

KATE
Eric let’s go

No response She tries the handle Locked

KATE
Eric We’re going to be late

Kate sighs Removes a paperclip Jams it in the lock
She’s done this before Click She opens the door
INT ERIC LERNER’S ROOM - MORNING

On the walls Travis Bickle Slipknot a Buddhist monk on
fire The room is empty Kate narrows her eyes
looks to the window She climbs out

EXT LERNER HOUSE

Kate scrambles out of the window Into the woods behind
the house Past vaulting trees Sound of breaking glass

INT WOODS

An old computer monitor shatters as a pocket knife is
hurled into it

ERIC LERNER 18 buzzed hair pale skin chipped-black
paint on his fingernails picks up the knife Steps back
Throws it again Kate approaches

KATE
We’re gonna be late

ERIC
No You’re gonna be late

He hurls the knife Cracks the monitor’s glass

KATE
Did you take your happy pill

ERIC
Did you take your bitchy pill

KATE
You took it for me So what did you and
dad talk about last night

ERIC
Nothing

KATE
Nothing You were there for six hours

Eric folds the knife Pockets it

ERIC
Maybe I will go to school with you

KATE
Really

He puts a joint between his lips Lights it
ERIC
Why the hell not

KATE
Please don’t do that in front of me

She grabs for it-- he backs up easily avoiding her hand
He taunts her leaning forward laughing-- she swipes for
it-- he’s too quick

ERIC
Oooh so close Try again Missed

KATE
It’s not funny Eric

INT HONDA CIVIC - DRIVING

Kate drives coffee in hand Eric pulls his black hoodie
over his hazy eyes shading them from the morning sun

KATE
So what did he say

ERIC
He’s moving to Chicago

KATE
Chicago As in the city

ERIC
No Chicago as in the state of mind

KATE
When did he decide that

ERIC
(shrugs )
He’s always wanted to live there

KATE
But he can’t just-- why didn’t he tell
me

ERIC
Dunno

KATE

He should have called--

ERIC
Maybe he knew you’d freak out and get
angry
KATE
Why would he move all the way out there

ERIC
Because it’s cool

KATE
When a man has a mid-life crisis he buys
a sports car or has an affair but he
doesn’t move half way across the
continent--

ERIC
Take a Xanax You sound like mom And
you wonder why he doesn’t want to talk to
you

KATE
Wait-- what does that mean

ERIC
WATCH IT

Kate brakes hard narrowly avoiding smashing into a
stopped pick up truck in front of her Kate’s hands are
trembling

KATE
- divorce now Chicago

Eric watches her get herself together
ERIC
He asked me to go with him I’m gonna
go with him
(confirming it)
I’m moving to Chicago with dad
She looks at him

EXT FRANKLIN HIGH - CONTINUOUS

The Honda Civic pulls into the parking lot of a massive
high school structure that resembles a modern sprawling
prison The intimidating image of safety and structure
The windows are nothing but slits high up on the second
story

KATE
Since when

ERIC
Since I hate this place This school is
like a prison
KATE
You don’t hate this place--

ERIC
Do you know what I daydream about when I
sit in class I daydream that someone
blows up a bomb in the principal’s office
and it melts everyone’s faces off

KATE
That’s terrible

ERIC
Now you see why I wanna go to Chicago

KATE
I can’t believe you’d just leave me

ERIC
Don’t get all menstrual about it It’s
not about you

KATE
Youre right it’s not It’s about us
Did you ever think that maybe I don’t
know I need you I need my older
brother My dad maybe My family

ERIC
Don’t be so co-dependent You can take
care of yourself You’re way smart and
you fit in with everyone Youll be
fine

Tears well up in Kate’s eyes

KATE
Why didn’t dad ask me to come

ERIC
It’s not like you guys get along You
always yell at him--

KATE
(yelling)
I don’t always yell at him--

ERIC
Youre always bossing him around telling
him what he should and shouldnt do I
thought you’d be psyched
(beat)
I mean do you even want to go to
Chicago
KATE
No I like it here But still

ERIC
It’s not that far away

A CLAW pierces through the table almost skewering Kate
Kate and Liz hold each other trying to keep quiet Under

over his lips

The monster’s claw slowly removes itself from the table
resulting in an outpouring of blood

Sound of scuttling scraping scratching on the table
top crunching across food trays and milk cartons

The tables groan above The raspy breathing of the beast
as it slowly crawls across the long tables in search for
more food

Kate and Liz don’t move a muscle--

Under a nearby table TOMMY remains still

Eric checks to see if it’s clear-- then rolls out from
under his table to join Kate and Liz

Trays knock off the table-- the sound of the monster
moving in his direction

KATE
(whispers)
Eric

Eric FREEZES A massive foot presses down on his
shoulder the creature stepping on him-- completely
unaware that Eric is there

TIGHT ON ERIC’S FACE - As the unseen creature stops above
him drool spilling down onto his cheek He holds his
breath lungs bursting

Kate’s eyes are wide-- watching--

KATE’S POV - Blocked by the table’s edge she can barely
make out CLEAR BUBBLES that have formed on the creature’s
back Something moving inside the bubbles

One by one the bubbles BURST releasing liquid and
birthing LONG THIN TAPEWORM SNAKES

Wet CREAM-COLORED SNAKES drop around Eric They slowly
squirm to life

Everyone watches in horror as the worms circle around
Eric

A CAN OF SODA-- rolls off the table above TOMMY CLINK

The little worms snake quickly toward Tommy Tommy backs
away crab-crawling toward the door--

TOMMY
No no--

A tapeworm wiggles up his pant legs burrowing itself
into his upper thigh He screams and jumps to his feet
Crashing into chairs Tommy howls His body jerking back
and forth as the large worms circle him

KATE’S POV - Under the table tops-- they bend and slide
as the massive creature lopes over them moving toward
Tommy

THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THE JOINING TABLES-- Kate watches
the Monster as it stands still before Tommy watching the
kid fall to the ground writhing on the ground as its
worms take hold of his body

Kate Liz and Eric wait a moment
KATE
(quietly)
Kitchen

Kate Liz and Eric (grabbing his backpack) sneak into--

INT CAFETERIA KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Cooking supplies metal cabinets Tweaker the remaining
Derelicts and Jose-- hiding in the corner

JOSE

TWEAKER

Naw man Let them stay
Tweaker takes a step toward Liz--
Liz snatches a KNIFE from the cutting board-- SHINK
She slices open the Tweaker’s HAND

LIZ
Get the fuck out

Liz lunges at them-- they try to grab her arm but she
cuts them carving up their hands and fingers--

JOSE
Bitch

She goes manic stabbing the air throwing pots and pans
at them slicing across Jose’s face--

LIZ
GET AWAY FROM ME GET AWAY FROM ME

She stabs at them-- they back off-- the Derelicts
Tweaker and Jose clutching their wounds rush from the
kitchen

Silence Liz pants clutching the knife
Kate goes to hug Liz--

KATE
It’s okay Liz--

LIZ
No no no it’s not okay It’s not
It’s not okay

SOUND OF JOSE AND THE DERELICTS IN THE CAFETERIA-- and
the ungodly SHRIEKING

JOSE (0S)
COME ON MOTHAFUCKER YOU WANT SOME COME

Sound of Jose and the Derelicts being ripped to shreds

Liz smiles a small creepy smile

LIZ
Now it’s okay

Eric jumps onto the stove reaches up and knocks out the
CEILING TILE above him Plants a CHAIR on the top like a
step ladder

KATE
What are you doing

ERIC
This is the short cut

LIZ

ERIC
We can crawl anywhere in the school
without that thing ever seeing us

KATE
(impressed)
How do you know that

ERIC
(shrugs )
Skipping Biology class

UNDERNEATH THE DOOR-- the four foot long snakes slither
into the room

One crawls over Lizs bare feet She jumps onto the
stove with Eric

CLANG Kate puts a METAL POT down around one of them
trapping it there

TINK TINK-- its little jaws banging against the inside
the pot as its tail flaps outside--

She turns-- a tapeworm strikes at Kate from the side--

THWACK Liz brings the knife down on it Severing its
neck from its long tail

As they pull themselves up-- MORE SNAKES SLIP UNDER THE
DOOR-- UP ONTO THE WALLS AROUND THEM

INT CEILING
Kate Eric and Liz crawl up into the ceiling tiles

Shafts of light beam up through the ceiling vents
piercing the darkness

ERIC
(pointing)
That way

Liz’s hand slips punching through the ceiling tile she
stumbles--

Kate and Eric grabs her

KATE
Eric This ceiling can’t hold us

ERIC
Put your weight only on the metal beams

LIZ
Now you tell me

THROUGH THE OPENING IN THE CEILING-—-

Kate can see in the cafeteria below-- the monster on top
of Jose feeding on him

Kate looks away Keeps moving

ERIC
Were not lost I can’t see which way

LIZ
Great Here genius

She removes a LIGHTER from her back pocket

Click Flash Liz lights it It dies Sparks Dies

As she does this-- Kate hears something else

Something soft and wet Writhing all around them

Click Flash Each flash illuminates the darkness around
them-- the wet slapping noise approaching-- too dark to
see--

Kate squints as Liz finally lights the lighter--
Revealing THREE TAPEWORMS creeping beside Eric-—-

Their spiked sucker-jaws puckered and hungry--

Eric punches down on the ceiling tile they’re slithering
upon-- causing the ceiling tile and the skinny beasts to

fall into an empty classroom below

ON LIZ - One tapeworm winds itself into her HAIR-- Liz
freaks swats at it flailing--

KATE
Liz

Liz falls through the ceiling tiles--

INT SCIENCE CLASSROOM

She falls through the ceiling-- violently slamming onto
the desks cracking down sending stools scattering

Liz lies on the floor bent groaning from the fall
Barely able to move from the impact Tapeworms moving
across her

Kate and Eric watch from the ceiling

KATE
We have to get her--

Without a thought Kate leaps down landing hard on the
table of Bunsen burners Eric stays up in the ceiling

The tapeworms dig into Liz’s skin piercing the soft side
of her neck with the sharp spikes of their jaws-- using
their twisting tails to push themselves deep inside her
skin--

Kate snatches it before it can get too deep--

Liz screaming as Kate wraps her fist around the thing’s
sinewy tail a tug-o-war leaning back with all her
strength to pull it out from her best friend’s neck--

KATE
No no no--

Kate falls back the snake in her hand-- it’s OUT--

It turns on Kate Jagged sucker jaws snapping at her
NECK longing for that warm flesh--

Kate holds it back as best she can slippery with slime
and sweat gripping it as it thrashes in her hands--

Liz groaning unable to help--

Kate stumbling back fighting the tapeworm’s whip--
Sees a SCALPEL next to a DEAD FROG-- reaches for it--
Eric jumps down-- snatches the scalpel--

He slices its tail sawing at it-- it fights turning on
Eric now biting at him--

ERIC
HOLD IT HOLD IT

THWICK The scalpel cuts the snake in half It dies
Kate drops it Looks thankfully at her brother

Liz on the ground sweaty hair in her face blocking her
groaning expression Eric and Kate sit Liz up--

KATE
Liz

Lizs face is a mask of pain and horror

LIZ
Oh God fuck Kate Kate

She lets out a guttural howl Eric’s eyes go wide-- Liz
lifts up the back of her shirt--

LIZ
Where’s the other one

The last piece of a tapeworm’s tail slips inside her
back right near her spine

KATE
No

They can see the thing snaking under her skin creating
an unnatural bulge as it twists around her spinal cord--

Liz sits straight up as if awakened--

KATE
Liz
Liz turns her head to face Kate her neck cracking and
snapping as she does so-- Liz looks right into Kate’s
eyes--

LIZ
Run

Kate and Eric stand slowly back away from Liz
Thoom Thoom Sound of something else coming
Pieces of the CEILING falls around them

Eric and Kate look up to see--

THE CEILING TILES THE CREATURE’S FEET PUNCHING THROUGH
THEM AS IT STUMBLES ALONG APPROACHING FAST--

Liz stands awkwardly staring absently at Kate Almost
lobotomized

Lizs shaking hands reach out to Kate--

Then grab the knob of a BUNSEN BURNER--

TURNING ON THE GAS

Liz struggles to turn on the other Bunsen Burners Kate
turns on other burners-- Eric grabs the FIRE EXTINGUISHER
off the wall SWINGS IT AGAINST THE BUNSEN BURNERS
KNOCKING THE BURNER TOPS OFF THE GAS POURS OUT

KATE
How are we gonna--—

Liz holds up her LIGHTER

LIZ

Kate’s eyes water Tears stream down Liz’s cheeks as gas
ripples quickly filling up the room-- Eric drags Kate
into the hallway Slams the door shut One last look to
her best friend through the window in the door

Liz arm extended flicking the lighter-- as the Monster
out of focus descends from the ceiling
