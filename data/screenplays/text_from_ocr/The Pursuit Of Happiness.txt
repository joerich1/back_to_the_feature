Hey put your plate in the sink

A few days ago was presented
with a report Id asked for

a comprehensive audit if you will
of our economic condition

You wont like it didnt like it
But we have to face the truth
and then go to work

to turn things around

And make no mistake about it
we can turn them around

The federal budget is out of control
And we face runaway deficits

of almost 80 billion

for this budget year

that ends September 30th

That deficit is larger than

the entire federal budget in 1 957
And so is the almost 80 billion
We will pay in interest
this year on the national debt
Twenty years ago in 1 960

our federal government payroll
was less than 1 3 billion

Today it is 75 billion

During these 20 years our population
has only increased by 23 3 percent
Man got two questions for you

And how do you do it

-Im a stockbroker

-Stockbroker Oh goodness
