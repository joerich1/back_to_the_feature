SMASH CUT TO

TIGHT ON A WOMAN’S FACE

Looking straight at us and trying so hard not to laugh it
looks almost painful This is ALICE CHAMBERS - 32 bold
equally warm and sharp

We’re no longer in the controlled almost stereotypically
1950’s tone of the promotional video -- this room is loud and
raucous and full of music and energy

WIDER reveals BUNNY (bawdy whip-smart) and PEG (pregnant a
little thirsty) beside Alice They’re balancing TRAYS of
GLASSES on their heads and all performing the same dance
They’re drunk and can’t stop laughing and we realize

INT LIVING ROOM - PETER AND PEG’S HOUSE - NIGHT

It’s the end of a dinner party and this is a boozy parlor
game These women are dancing for the HUSBANDS -- Alice’s
JACK Bunny’s DEAN and Peg’s PETER -- who watch
appreciatively from the couch equally drunk

Peg’s not very good at the game frowning as she tries to
keep up Her husband PETER encourages her as he watches the
rest of the room with a competitive nervous energy--

PETER
That-- keep it straight honey--

Bunny’s amazing at it sipping from her own cocktail as she
dances Her husband DEAN a boisterous jock teases her
DEAN
You’re wearing too much clothing
Bunny It’s weighing you down If
you take your shirt off

Alice and JACK barely break eye contact as he watches her
mesmerized totally in love Jack is the dream partner
sexy charming fun supportive and obsessed with his wife

The tray slips off Peg’s head and glass SHATTERS Alice
jumps which just makes her laugh harder and her tray falls

ALICE
No Let me go again Let me--

She grabs the drink from Jack’s hand downs the rest of it
and puts it on her head just as the song ends The women end
their dance with a flourish trying to hold in laughter

Jack jumps to his feet wraps his arms around Alice--
JACK

Youre such a cheater You’re an
egregious cheater--

ALICE JACK (CONTD)
It was quick-thinking Ima And it was with my drink you
problem solver-- made me an accomplice--

She laughs as he pulls her on to his lap She slings her
legs over his very comfortable there like it’s home base

PEG
My balance was off because of the
baby

BUNNY
(innocently)
What baby

Peter hands Peg a DUSTPAN and she kneels to clean up the
broken glass without question Bunny pours Dean a drink

BUNNY (CONTD)
Chop chop gentlemen Let’s see
some tricks

JACK
There’s no way we could follow
that

DEAN

Speak for yourself

Dean grabs three glasses and starts JUGGLING He immediately
drops all of them and they SMASH on the ground

DEAN (CONTD)
Peg there’s some here too

Alice stands Jack grabs at her pulling her back down--

JACK
No you can’t leave

ALICE
(amused)
Ill be right back

JACK
Don’t do it

She kisses him and goes He grins as he watches her walk
away Peter walks up to Jack offering him a drink

PETER
How do you do that

He tries to say it teasingly but there’s a jealous
undercurrent

JACK
Do what

They both watch Alice walk into the bathroom

PETER
That

INT BATHROOM - PETER AND PEG’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alice washes her hands swaying a little-- that moment of not
realizing how drunk you are until you’re alone in a bathroom

She dries her hands then pours herself a glass of TAP WATER
and chugs it As she puts the glass away she notices a
FRAMED PHOTO Peter and Peg posing in front of Niagara Falls
Alice picks it up They’re cute

INT LIVING ROOM - PETER AND PEG’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Alice walks in as Bunny’s dancing on a footstool a drink in

each hand Peg’s still on her knees cleaning up the glass
Dean starts handing out CIGARS Peter takes one asking--
PETER
With the promotion do they
automatically move you to a bigger
place

BUNNY
The house will be ready by the end
of the month

PEG
Oh Dean will you smoke outside

DEAN
(lighting his cigar)
Peter your wife is drunk She’s
babbling nonsense

PEG
Peter doesn’t like the sm--

PETER
Honey

Peg quiets Dean winks at her and balances an ASH TRAY on
her back Peg jokingly starts crawling around on the ground
like an animal Everyone laughs until--

PEG’S SON (0S)
Mommy

They all turn -- a sleepy BOY in pajamas stands on the
stairs rubbing his eyes

PEG
Go to bed Billy

PEG’S SON (0S)
Youre being too loud

DEAN
BOO Go back upstairs you wet
blanket We’re praying

The adults burst out laughing

EXT ROAD - NIGHT

A BIRDS EYE VIEW of Jack’s CAR snaking through the streets
of the edge of the development His headlights are the only
lights on the road
INT EXT JACK’S CAR - NIGHT

Jack drives Alice draped over him kissing him They’re
drunk and happy

ALICE
I have a real question is Peg ever
not pregnant

JACK
There have to be a few hours at
least when she’s actively giving
birth

ALICE
I feel like they have 17 children

JACK
And Peter’s always trying to
impregnate you

ALICE
No he’s not

JACK
I wouldn’t leave you alone with him
without a very sharp weapon

ALICE
You don’t think I could handle
Peter

JACK

I know you could handle Peter I
didn’t say the weapon was for you

Alice laughs just as Jack SWERVES the car off the road
squealing into the desert Alice laughs startled but not
surprised this is clearly something he’s done before--

ALICE
Jack

He grins at her as makes wild turns going faster and faster
He floors it neither noticing as his headlights catch--

A figure standing in the middle of the desert

They’re speeding towards it getting closer and closer Jack
notices it the last second-- Alice SCREAMS as he swerves
just missing it t the car fishtailing to a stop

Jack grips the steering wheel adrenaline through the roof--
JACK
Jesus CHRIST

Alice turns to look behind her The figure is a WOMAN in a
disheveled nightgown She’s still standing there in the red
glow of Jack’s brake lights She never even flinched Alice
squints realizing--

ALICE
Is that Margaret

The woman MARGARET locks eyes with Alice Alice holds her
gaze startled at the intensity but unable to look away

JACK
Of course it is--

ALICE
What is she doing out here

JACK
She’s a lunatic Oh my God

Alice starts to open her door--

ALICE
She’s alone out there--

JACK
I’1l call Ted when we get home

Jack floors it speeding away Alice looks over her
shoulder Margaret’s still standing there getting smaller as
the pull away until finally it’s just--

A BLACK VOID

Just blackness Then from overhead

A row of beautiful DANCERS in BLACK AND WHITE stream into

view It’s a parade of identical women in matching outfits
practically anonymous in their uniformity

The dancers burst into a KALEIDOSCOPE of Busby-Berkeley-style
choreography creating geometric shapes with their bodies
twirling and bending and jumping like they’re one organism

The women dance towards each other closer and closer until
they each hold up a FAN which creates a single image

Alice’s terrified screaming face We FALL through one of
her EYES like a black hole--
INT BEDROOM - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DAY

WHAM Alice hits the floor of her bedroom with a sickening
CRACK-- she’s flung herself out of the bed in her sleep

She sits up still in shock from the nightmare and the hard
fall She moves stiffly wincing and glances at Jack-- but
he’s still asleep She quietly gets up to start her day

INT KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACKS HOUSE - DAY

Alice prepares a perfect breakfast It’s a flawlessly
coordinated routine and she takes real pleasure in it EGGS
cracked BACON frying a TOMATO sliced sliced sliced
unnervingly close to her fingers COFFEE poured into a cup--

Jack in a sharp suit hair still wet from the shower picks
the cup up to take a sip as Alice puts hot bacon on his
plate He watches her adoringly

JACK
You remember there’s the thing at
Frank’s house tomorrow for--

ALICE
The new couple Yes I’m making
tuna noodle salad
(off Jacks look)

What
JACK

It’s just he doesn’t like tuna
ALICE

Frank
JACK

I know it seems small but I think
these things add up when he’s
making decisions

ALICE
I’1l make deviled eggs

Suddenly a small TREMOR starts shaking the house Alice
reaches behind her to hold the cabinet steady as Jack holds
their coffee cups When it stops Alice gives Jack a look

ALICE (CONTD)
That’s the third one this week

Jack is just beaming at her

ALICE (CONTD)
What

JACK
Nothing You’re justthe best
I’m so lucky

Alice kisses him then straightens his tie hands him his
LUNCH and gives him a playful smack on the ass as he leaves
He turns back to grab her but she laughs and shoves him off--

ALICE
You’re gonna be late These things
add up

He kisses her once more and hurries out the door Alice

watches him go then takes a deep breath and turns back to
the house ready to tackle her day

EXT ALICE AND JACKS HOUSE - DAY
Jacks car pulls out of the driveway as all the men on the
block head in the same direction toward Oasis

INT VARIOUS - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DAY

-- Alice WASHES her hands like a surgeon both hands in the
air cleaning hard between each finger

-- She SCRUBS every surface of the kitchen with an efficiency
that would impress the most intense germaphobe The original
Peter Pan cartoon movie plays on the TV keeping her company

-- She DUSTS a row of romantic PHOTOS of her and Jack the
two of them on their wedding day laughing on the beach on
their honeymoon posing in black tie at a town dance

-- She SNAPS laundry straight then folds it nicely setting
it next to a CALENDAR where four days a month are “X-ed” out

-- She IRONS She SWEEPS She VACUUMS

INT KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACKS HOUSE - DAY

Done with her work Alice justwaits She sits in silence
totally still We PUSH IN slowly as a SHARP SOUND gets
increasingly louder until finally Alice looks up

Out her window she can see her backyard separated from
their neighbor’s front yard by a WHITE PICKET FENCE

On the other side of the fence Margaret tends to her ROSE
BUSH The ground is covered in the heads of severed white
roses

INT BUSEXT STREET - DAY

Alice and other HOUSEWIVES ride the NEIGHBORHOOD TROLLEY BUS
They’re all SINGING a call-and-response song clapping along
to the rhythm

With the men at work during the day Oasis is all women
The population’s surprisingly diverse

The jolly DRIVER pulls over at a stop and a few more WOMEN
board They immediately start singing as well

INT TOWN MARKET - DAY

From overhead Alice and other HOUSEWIVES stream into view
gliding their shopping carts through the aisles like ants
through an ant farm

-- A SAMPLE GIRL is handing out free APPETIZERS

SAMPLE GIRL
Pineapple fingers and ham

Alice takes one nodding her thanks without stopping

-- She charms the BUTCHER as he cuts her a slab of meat

MARKET BUTCHER ALICE
When will I finally get to You never come over You’re
see what you do with these always teasing me

beautiful cuts I give you
-- The CHECKOUT LADY bags Alice’s food hands it to her

MARKET CHECKOUT LADY
Eight dollars has been added to
Jack’s account

ALICE
Thank you so much

In the next lane an EMBARRASSED HOUSEWIFE is trying to
quietly plead with the CHECKOUT MAN who shakes his head

MARKET CHECKOUT MAN
I’m sorry ma’am but your husband
has capped the credit at 5

The Housewife glances behind her embarrassed as she takes a
few items off the counter Alice leans over to the Checkout
Lady as she leaves--

ALICE
Will you put the rest of hers on
Jack’s account too

The Checkout Lady nods discreetly as Alice exits

EXT ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DAY

Alice arms full of groceries stands at the hedge between
her front yard and Bunny’s Bunny hangs LAUNDRY on a
clothesline as her rambunctious KIDS (son HANK 7 son FRED
5 and daughter JANE 3) play with the HOSE behind her

BUNNY
Don’t point the hose at the
laundry
(back to Alice)
Was she drunk

ALICE
I have no idea She didn’t even
move We almost killed her

BUNNY
You’re sure it was Margaret

ALICE
Who else would be standing in the
middle of the desert in her
pajamas

BUNNY
(to her kids)
Unwrap it from her neck Hank

Alice gestures to an Oasis-branded MOVING TRUCK parked at the
end of their street

ALICE
Have you heard anything about them

BUNNY
They’re young apparently Bill
and something

ALICE
I guess she’ll be my new best
friend since you’re leaving

BUNNY
Dont worry Dean said Jack’s
gonna get promoted and you’1ll be
right behind us What are you
making for the party tomorrow

ALICE
Deviled eggs

BUNNY
Oh Jack’s gonna be CEO--

She senses chaos behind her and turns to her kids on a dime

BUNNY (CONTD)
That’s it I’m calling him

Hank immediately drops the hose

BUNNY’S SON HANK
DON’T

BUNNY
I have to This is why Santa gave
me his phone number

BUNNY’S SON FRED BUNNY (CONTD)
(frantic) He said I had to let him know
WERE NOT DOING IT ANYMORE if you’re being bad--

BUNNY (CONTD)
I wish it were up to me I wish I
had a choice--

She picks up the hose and starts SPRAYING the kids They
shriek delighted sprinting around as Bunny chases them
They hide behind Alice who jokingly protects them--

BUNNY (CONTD)
You think I won’t spray her

INT KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DAY

Alice still a little wet from the hose cooks the same way
she cleans like she’s preparing for battle She CHUGS a
glass of water-- WASHES her hands-- WIPES clean the surfaces--
then SLAPS a thick cut of meat on a cutting board

Alice WHISTLES a tune as she lays out her materials twine a
needle scissors a MASSIVE KNIFE She starts to hack at the
meat Slicing slicing slicing until she stops with a
guttural moan

She’s cut through the meat of her thumb nearly severing it
It’s dangling off of her hand like a loose tooth

Alice’s stunned She stares at her hand for a beat-- then
reaches up and slowly pushes her thumb back where it belongs

Something about that snaps her into TRIAGE MODE She moves
quickly and purposefully almost like a sense memory--

She washes the wound WINCING as the water hits the cut then
lays her hand on the counter like it’s another piece of meat

With one hand she lights the stove-- fishes a pair of
SCISSORS out of a drawer-- then picks up the needle and twine
with the scissors and holds them both over the open flame

Once they’re sterilized she uses the scissors to pierce the
skin of the wound then the other side pulling tight She
twists the string then pulls it through the cut again
She’s suturing her own wound Pierce wince swoop bite
tie Over and over She flips her hand over then sutures
the other side Finished

Alice stares at her trembling hand more startled by what she
just did than by the cut itself How did she do that

Then she registers the mess in front of her She gathers the
bloody evidence wiping up the counter--
EXT BACKYARD - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DUSK

Alice glances around furtively as she throws the bloody
evidence in the garbage She turns to sneak back inside--

And sees Fred Bunny’s son watching her from the yard next
door Alice freezes

ALICE
Hi honey What are you doing

Fred holds up a stick to answer Then

FRED
What are you doing

ALICE
My chores I need my allowance so
I can split it with you

Fred grins Alice waves him back inside

INT KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DUSK

Her hand wrapped in a bandage Alice continues to cook dinner
as if nothing happened

INT DINING ROOM - ALICE AND JACKS HOUSE - NIGHT

Alice finishes lighting the CANDLES on a beautifully-set
dining room table when HEADLIGHTS flood through the windows

BY THE FRONT DOOR

Jack walks in to find Alice waiting in the foyer holding a
COCKTAIL in a HIGHBALL GLASS for him He grins at the image

ALICE

JACK
Hi
They say it like they really missed each other even though
it’s just been a few hours Alice hands him the drink and
takes his briefcase then helps him pull his jacket off
There’s a heightened sexy energy to this evening routine

ALICE
How was your day

JACK
Boring Much better now

He notices her bandage and grabs it immediately concerned

JACK (CONTD)
What happened to your hand

Alice waves it off trying to seem casual

ALICE
Nothing I cut myself cooking

Jack searches her face but she looks fine He kisses the
bandage She starts backing up pulling him with her

ALICE (CONTD)
I made a roast

JACK
It smells amazing

He’s backed her up against the dining table This also seems
like part of the evening routine

ALICE
And some green beans

JACK
What else

He reaches up under her dress

ALICE
Mashed potatoes

Jack finally kisses her She wraps her legs around him and
Jack turns her around and bends her over the table as they
start to have passionate spirited sex

Her head is inches from the lit candles and the rattling
steak knives-- it feels slightly dangerous but she doesn’t
notice or care It’s animalistic and hot and we CUT TO

FRANK
Jack you came

EXT FRANKS HOUSE - DAY

FRANK Oasis’s CEO and de-facto Mayor and his wife SHELLEY
stand in the doorway of their INSANELY GORGEOUS MANSION

It’s all clean lines and glass practically twinkling in the
sun The sounds of a PARTY float from the backyard

Alice (carrying a tray of APPETIZERS and wearing white
GLOVES) and Jack wave as they approach the house

Frank is the definition of quiet power brilliant confident
disarming Shelley Oasis’s “first lady” is warm and
gracious the ideal host

Jack shakes Frank’s hand still starstruck by his boss as
Alice and Shelley hug--

JACK

SHELLEY ALICE

SHELLEY (CONTD)
Frank look at her she’s glowing
(teasing re her belly)
(MORE )

SHELLEY (CONTD)
Is this glow due to any particular
reason

ALICE
Just general happiness I think

Shelley notices the edge of the bandage peeking out from
Alice’s glove Shelley reaches for it--

SHELLEY
What happened honey

ALICE
(pulling her glove down)
Oh just a kitchen wound

SHELLEY
Our battle scars

ALICE
We’re so excited to meet the new
couple

FRANK
They’re lovely Bill and Violet
Painfully young

ALICE

like there’s a new couple here

FRANK

positions to fill

He claps Jack on the shoulder Jack beams

EXT FRANKS BACKYARD - DAY

Jack and Alice walk out awed-- the back is even more
gorgeous than the front COUPLES roam around the manicured
lawn and beautiful pool past a SCALE MODEL of the town of
Oasis on display Everyone’s having fun pouring drinks

Alice squeezes Jack’s hand He kisses her cheek Frank and
Shelley’s KENNEDY-ESQUE KIDS walk around with platters of
appetizers serving in adorable outfits

Jack sees Dean at the bar and kisses Alice before he walks
over to him Alice spots Bunny holding a cocktail and
talking to a CHATTY HOUSEWIFE Bunny catches Alice’s eye and
gives her a “thank God” look

BUNNY
(to Chatty Housewife)
You know what will you excuse me
I just saw Alice and it looks like
she needs help Withher leg

Bunny hurries over to Alice

BUNNY (CONTD)
Thank Christ

ALICE
You having fun over there

BUNNY
How long would you think she could
talk about her son’s art projects
Multiply it by your entire life

She gestures to Frank and Shelleys kids

BUNNY (CONTD)
Do they wear matching outfits every
day I find them terrifying
(takes a sip then)
But that little one makes maybe the
best Manhattan I’ve ever had

JUMP CUT TO

Alice Jack Bunny and Dean talk to the new couple BILL and
VIOLET Bill’s sweet and anxious like he’s always worried
he’s about to screw something up Violet’s young and eager
The women chat off to one side

VIOLET
And then we honeymooned in Sea
Island

ALICE

We honeymooned in Sea Island So

Dominicks

As Bill talks with Jack and Dean like an eager freshmen
hanging out with the cool seniors

BILL
We’re just-- so excited to be here
Really excited Can’t believe it

DEAN
All right you got the job Calm
down

Back with Violet Alice lowers her voice kindly

ALICE
How are you actually doing
(off Violet’s surprise)
This is a lot You’ve met a
hundred new people and are probably
drowning in casseroles

VIOLET
It’s wonderful We’re just
unpacking and adjusting
(admitting)
It is kind of a lot

Alice touches Jack speaking loudly enough for the men

ALICE
Why don’t you come shopping in town
with us tomorrow And Bill can
golf with the boys It’s our
little Sunday tradition

BUNNY
They exercise their bodies and we
go exercise their wallets

DEAN
Bunny’s practically an Olympic
athlete at this point

Violet looks to Bill for permission Bill glances at Jack

BILL
Is that-- okay Can I do that

JACK
(amused)
Yeah Bill If you want to

Bill can’t hide how thrilled he is

BILL
Okay yeah great Count me in
Sunday golf With the boys

He squeezes Violet’s hand and beams at her Alice and Jack
catch eyes sharing a smile He takes her hand when--

GLASS TINKS Everyone turns-- Shelley’s standing with Frank
tapping a glass to get everyone’s attention

SHELLEY
Thank you for coming out to help us
give a warm welcome to Bill and
Violet If you’re here it’s
because we believe you’re the best
and the future of Oasis

Some claps Bill flushes Shelley looks at Frank adoringly

SHELLEY (CONTD)
Bill Violet you don’t yet know
how lucky you are to learn from my
husband and be a part of this
community that he created but soon
you will

MARGARET (0S)
(loudly)
We’re not alone

Everyone turns startled Margaret’s standing in the middle
of the crowd TED her mortified husband tries to quiet her
without making a scene but Margaret doesn’t move

MARGARET (CONTD)
You all know it Something’s out
there And we’re hiding here

Violet looks to Bunny and Alice concerned

VIOLET
Who is that

BUNNY
Margaret
(sotto to Alice)
She’s gonna get Ted fired

MARGARET
They’re out there

Ted starts dragging her away as--

Frank clears his throat Everyone immediately turns back to
him quiet They watch him with reverence

FRANK

Part of what makes us a family is
that we support each other even in
the most difficult times

(then)
This is a special place Shelley
sometimes teases me and says I’ve
created our own little world out
here but the truth is it’s one
we’ve created And it’s one I’m so
proud of Not just because of the
extraordinary and brave work you
gentleman do at Oasis but
because this is a community that
accepts everyone

The crowd nods roused

FRANK (CONTD)
This is what the world should look
like and should feel like Out
there arbitrary regulations and
rules stop us from being as
innovative as we know we can be
And if we have to create our own
universe out here until everybody
else catches up so be it

Alice glances around realizing that Jack is gone

FRANK (CONTD)
Were having a pretty good time

Everyone CHEERS and WHOOPS raising their glasses

INT FRANK’S HOUSE - DAY

Alice tiptoes down the pristine stylish hallway her
footsteps echoing in the empty house She whispers

ALICE
Jack

She walks around the corner--

MARGARET
Are you lost

Margaret is standing right there Alice jumps a mile

ALICE
Oh my God

MARGARET
I can’t find my way out either

Alice studies her face concerned

ALICE
Are you okay Margaret

Margaret looks at Alice like that question is insane

MARGARET
No None of us are

ALICE
If you ever want to talk or need
anything you know I’m right next
door Last night--

MARGARET
I don’t sleep well I have bad
dreams Like you

Alice blinks startled

ALICE
I don’t have bad dreams

MARGARET
Yes you do You see them too And
now it’s too late for both of us
We don’t belong here

ALICE
(disturbed)
I need to find my husband

Alice quickly walks away leaving Margaret alone in the
hallway She rounds the corner and passes by an open door
stopping when she sees--
INT BEDROOM - FRANK’S HOUSE - DAY
Jack is standing in Frank’s beautiful light-filled BEDROOM

ALICE
What are you doing

Jack looks up delighted to see her

JACK
Look at this

She walks over Jack who’s standing at a beautiful DRESSER
It’s covered in private details cuff links scattered
jewelry framed photos of Frank and Shelley Alice picks one
up Frank and Shelley posing in front of Niagara Falls

JACK (CONTD)
This is where he sleeps This is
crazy

Jacks genuinely awed by the intimate space He touches a
NECKTIE left on the dresser admiring it studying it

JACK (CONTD)
I wonder why he chose this tie

Alice watches him lovingly His adoration is cute if a
little obsessive She leans into him

ALICE
I like your ties

Jack kisses her-- then reaches under her dress Alice looks
at him surprised but game

ALICE (CONTD)
Everyone’s outside

Jack doesn’t care Just being in this room is a turn-on He
presses her up against the wall unbuckling his pants as she
wraps her legs around him They start to have sex as
silently as they can Alice moans and Jack covers her mouth
to keep them quiet She grabs at him then sees--

Frank is standing in the doorway

Watching them Staring at Alice They lock eyes for a beat
too long It’s like she’s in a trance Jack clocks it and
follows her eyes-- he sees Frank jumps and pulls up his
pants scrambling away from Alice caught

FRANK
You two all right

JACK
Yeah Yes sir

Another beat Frank just keeps staring at them Then he
grabs a pair of SUNGLASSES from the dresser gives Jack a
tiny almost proud smirk

FRANK
I should’ve knocked

Frank walks out Jack is a buzzed combination of embarrassed
and thrilled He kisses Alice quickly before hurrying out
after Frank

Alice stands there totally thrown alone in Frank’s bedroom
She smooths down her dress putting herself together and
looks down at the dresser to a FRAMED PICTURE the whole
community posing in black tie like a class photo

Alice finds herself in the crowd beaming in black and white
We PUSH IN on her face until suddenly--

It cracks apart like pieces of glass We’re back in the

BLACK VOID

And back in BLACK AND WHITE The Busby Berkeley DANCERS had
been holding the pieces of her face together

They toss them aside and begin a choreography one dancer
grabs another from behind holding her face

It’s beautiful but then it morphs from choreography to what
seems like real violence The first dancer covers the other’s
mouth smothering her-- she can’t breathe-- she kicks and
flails scared and tries to SCREAM as we CUT TO--

INT BEDROOM - ALICE AND JACKS HOUSE - DAY

Alice’s eyes pop open-- her back is arched halfway off the
bed her body contorted one hand smothering herself She
cant breath She struggles to pry her own hand off finally
getting free with a painful GASP She catches her breath
stunned while Jack sleeps next to her

INT BOUTIQUE - DAY

Alice Bunny and Violet walk through a CLOTHING BOUTIQUE
checking out different dresses Violet looks around amazed--

VIOLET
We can just charge at all these
stores

ALICE

It goes right to their Oasis
accounts

Alice starts WHISTLING the same tune she was whistling
before

BUNNY
They can put a limit though so
don’t let yourself go
(to Alice)
What is that song

ALICE
I was hoping you would know It’s
been in my head for days I can’t
figure out what it’s from

BUNNY
I hate that

Just then a TREMOR runs through the store -- everything
shakes gently the clothing racks rattling Violet’s eyes go
wide but Alice and Bunny barely register it It’s over as
quickly as it started

BUNNY (CONTD)
The joys of desert living Soon
youll barely notice them

ALICE
We never have to drive The bus
runs from morning til six and takes
you everywhere you need to go

VIOLET
Do you ever bring the boys their
lunch

ALICE
To Oasis

Bunny almost laughs

BUNNY
No Of course not

Violet gives them an impish look

VIOLET
You guys have really never been I
mean I know we’re not supposed to
but just to sneak a peek

ALICE BUNNY
No Never
ALICE (CONTD)
Only employees are allowed near the
headquarters

BUNNY
It’s way too dangerous

ALICE
And why would we We have
everything here

VIOLET
What do you think they’re doing
Bill says it’s technology to create
a better world--

BUNNY
(a little too sharp)
We don’t really talk about it
honey

Violet shrinks self-conscious Bunny softens

BUNNY (CONTD)
Honestly even if they tried to
explain it I couldn’t understand

ALICE
They’re doing important work but
our work back here is just as
vital We have to take care of
them and support them so they can
go change the world

VIOLET
Absolutely And I’m ready to do
that for Bill I just
(admitting)
I’m worried I’1l get a little stir
crazy

Alice and Bunny exchange a look Violet clocks it

VIOLET (CONTD)
What

ALICE
Margaret went out to Oasis once

BUNNY
(don’t do this”)
Alice--

VIOLET
That weird woman from the party

BUNNY
(giving in to the story)
She used to be normal

ALICE
She went out there with her son--

BUNNY
She walked

ALICE
Trying to get to the Oasis
headquarters they think But she
never made it They found her
alone two days later wandering and
dehydrated totally out of it

VIOLET
Alone like--

BUNNY
They never found her son

Violet’s stunned

VIOLET
What did

ALICE
So we can’t just go wandering
around

BUNNY
But you won’t go stir crazy

She says the next part for Alice’s benefit as much as
Violets

BUNNY (CONTD)
We just have to play by the rules
and then we get to enjoy all of
this Being a good sport is how
you get what you want So let’s
move on to more pressing business
and find you a dress for the
Anniversary Party

VIOLET
What’s that

BUNNY
It’s the best night of the year
It’s like our own private July 4th

ALICE
Frank throws a blowout to celebrate
the anniversary of Oasis’s
incorporation

Bunny holds up a dress

BUNNY
The question is how soon do you
want to have a baby Because if
you wear this dress Bill will
impregnate you immediately

VIOLET
(laughing)
Bill wants one yesterday I gotta
do my job while he does his

CUT TO
CLOSE ON a lawn-mower blade shredding grass

WIDEN OUT to see a LANDSCAPER mowing the lawn of a bright
green golf course at the edge of the barren cracked desert

EXT COUNTRY CLUB POOL - DAY

Alice Bunny and Violet eat lunch by the pool of a CLASSIC
COUNTRY CLUB women tanning in stylish bathing suits and swim
caps KIDS sticky with popsicles MEN in golf clothes or
tennis whites wandering around the edges

WAITERS bring the women more drinks One offers Violet
COCONUT OIL which she happily accepts Bunny’s daughter
Jane is curled up on Alice’s lap explaining how her toy
works Alice listens warmly

BUNNY
Jane Go find your brothers Let
Alice eat

Violet watches as Jane kisses Alice and climbs awkwardly out
of her lap scurrying after the boys

VIOLET
How many kids do you have

ALICE
I don’t have children

Violet reacts as if Alice just admitted to occasional murder

VIOLET
Oh

BUNNY
Don’t get me started

VIOLET
I’m so sorry

ALICE
Don’t apologize It’s just not
what Jack and I want

VIOLET
(even more surprised)
It’s on purpose How
(a little embarrassed)
I mean he’s so handsome and he
adores you how do you stop

yourself--

BUNNY
They don’t I’m next door I hear
everything She and Jack just

want each other for themselves
It’s nauseating

ALICE
Bunny’s kids like me more than they
like her anyway

BUNNY
That’s true and infuriating

Alice laughs as she watches Jane and Bunny’s sons playing by
the side of the pool Behind them a row of LADIES swim laps
in matching SWIM CAPS with smiling faces on them

VIOLET
I think three is the perfect
number Bill wants four

BUNNY
Once they outnumber you it’s all
the same Having a second kid is
like you’re drowning and someone
throws you a baby

As their heads dip in and out of the water the faces on the
swim caps MORPH into PAINED or SCREAMING faces

Alice blinks startled-- but as the ladies come up for air
one last time the caps are back to normal
BUNNY (CONTD)
Alice how many babies should
Violet have
Alice shakes off that moment turning back to the women
ALICE
At least five
INT KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACKS HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY
TIGHT SHOTS of Alice’s breakfast routine EGG cracked BACON
fried COFFEE poured JACK kissed She hands him his LUNCH

INT VARIOUS - ALICE AND JACKS HOUSE - DAY

Jack gone Alice tackles her day She WASHES her hands like
a surgeon again careful to work around her BANDAGE

-- She SCRUBS-- DUSTS-- VACUUMS-- SNAPS-- FOLDS--

INT KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACKS HOUSE - DAY

Alice wraps SARAN WRAP around leftovers organizing the
fridge She pulls a big piece then stares at it for a beat
Almost hypnotically she wraps it around her face smothering
herself

She struggles to breathe against the clear plastic mouth
open gasping-- she leaves it on a beat too long then
quickly frees herself She stands there rattled

INT BUSEXT STREET - DAY

Alice rides the bus It pulls to a stop but she doesn’t get
off The Driver waits a beat but she doesn’t move He
pulls back on to the road

BUS DRIVER
No shopping today

ALICE
I’m just here for a joyride Get
some fresh air get out of the
house for a bit

The Driver winks at her

INT BUSEXT STREET - DAY

A HOUSEWIFE steps off at the last stop at the very the edge
of town Alice is the only passenger left as the bus turns
to make its way back into the heart of downtown

She stares out into empty desert beyond their little village
A single road leads out to the OASIS HEADQUARTERS barely
visible in the distance Then she spots--

There’s a plane in the sky above the Oasis Headquarters
that’s starting to falter It dips struggling to keep its
nose up dropping dangerously It looks like it’s out of
control She calls out without taking her eyes off of it--

ALICE
Sir Do you see

It dips again then suddenly plunges toward the ground
disappearing behind the Oasis building just as it would CRASH

into the earth Alice CRIES OUT--

ALICE (CONTD)
OH MY GOD

BUS DRIVER
You alright miss

Alice jumps to her feet and hurries up to the driver--

ALICE
Did you see that That plane

She points to where she saw it but the sky is empty

BUS DRIVER
I’m afraid I don’t know what you--

ALICE
It crashed A plane just crashed

BUS DRIVER
(squinting as he looks)
Are you sure

ALICE
We have to see if anyone-- drive
that way I can show you where--

BUS DRIVER
I don’t go that way

ALICE
What

BUS DRIVER
That’s not my route I have to
return to town make sure you girls
get everything you need

ALICE
That-- people could be hurt--

BUS DRIVER
I don’t go that way

ALICE
A plane crashed--

BUS DRIVER
That’s not my route

Alice can’t believe him She grabs her bag and throws him an
angry look as she dashes off the bus--

ALICE
I’1l go myself

She starts racing toward where she saw the crash The Driver
stares at her for a long beat then slowly turns the bus back
to town

EXT ROAD - DAY

Alice hurries toward the looming Oasis Headquarters sweating
in the sun She passes a SIGN -- WARNING Hazardous
Materials Ahead Security Personnel Only -- but keeps going
A lot more WARNING SIGNS wait ahead

EXT OASIS PROJECT HEADQUARTERS - DAY
Alice finally approaches the OASIS HEADQUARTERS

Most of the facility is underground -- an industrial
concrete above-ground structure is the only entrance

Alice searches for any sign of the plane -- but she doesn’t
see anything No debris no smoke No one is here at all

There’s a DOORWAY to the building but no other windows no
identifiable signs Alice calls out

ALICE
Hello
(then)
Anyone There’s been an accident

She stares at the door She knows they’re not supposed to go
inside But she takes a breath then a step and pushes the
door open and suddenly--

We SMASH CUT TO Alice’s PUPIL DILATING-- then it’s--

FULL SENSORY OVERLOAD

Strobing lights-- a horrible indefinable noise-- it’s frantic
and chaotic and overwhelming

In ALICE’S POV-- colors and shapes start to come into focus--
IMAGES are being projected on the walls and on her body She
tries to move her arms but they’re being held down--

CUT TO

INT LIVING ROOM - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Lights from the TV (the original Alice in Wonderland cartoon)
flash on Alice’s face as she snaps awake SCREAMING on the
couch

Jack runs in from the kitchen holding a pan--

JACK
What What Are you okay

Alice scrambles to her feet pulling at her arms as if there
are still ropes there Jack drops the pan and holds her a
little freaked out--

JACK (CONTD)
Youre okay Alice honey HONEY

ALICE
What happened

JACK
Just calm down You had a bad
dream

He gently pushes her back down to the couch

ALICE
No No no no--

JACK
Yes you’re okay

ALICE
That-- when did you get here
JACK
A few hours ago You were asleep
on the couch I figured you
weren’t feeling well

ALICE

How did I get home
JACK

The bus
ALICE

He came out and got me
JACK

(confused)

It took you home from town The
driver stopped by an hour ago to
check on you He said you were
acting strange when he dropped you
off

ALICE
No I got off the bus There was a
plane crash I went to help

JACK
A plane crash

ALICE
I saw it--

JACK

Baby I would’ve heard if a plane
had crashed

(he touches her forehead)
What did you eat today

Alice’s head is spinning

ALICE
The driver brought me here

JACK
Yes And you’ve been out like a
light since then
Alice finally registers the pan he had been holding

ALICE
Were you cooking

JACK
Well yeah There was no dinner
I had to fend for myself
(then admitting)
It’s a disaster I think you might
have to buy new pans

Alice laughs despite herself and stands
ALICE
Let me make you something You

must be starving

Jack sits back watching happily as Alice hurries into the
kitchen He calls after her

JACK
Id love a steak

INT BATHROOM - ALICE AND JACKS HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

Alice showers mind wandering She starts washing her hair
unraveling the bandage on her hand so it doesn’t get wet
stopping in her tracks when she sees--

Her cuthas turned black The skin is rotting away
revealing new skin underneath Alice studies it horrified--

Suddenly the shower curtain’s YANKED back Alice jumps
Jack pokes his head in dressed for work--

JACK
I’m heading out Love you

Alice tries to hide her hand behind her We can’t tell if
Jack clocks it She kisses him goodbye

INT KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DAY
Alice finishes re-wrapping her bandage when she hears--

BUNNY (0S)
Is she awake

Alice goes to the window-- Bunny and Violet are chatting in
Bunny’s yard Bunny waves calling out

BUNNY (CONTD)
Look who decided to join the land
of the living I heard you hit the
sauce last night

Alice flinches but covers calling through the glass

ALICE
It’s what I get for trying to keep
up with y--

She stops mid-word

There’s another plane in the sky behind Bunny and Violet
It’s faltering and dipping like the last one plunging then
desperately trying to right itself

ALICE (CONTD)
No

It starts to drop out of the sky Alice bangs on the glass
trying to get Violet and Bunny to notice but they’re
chatting obliviously

EXT ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DAY

Bunny and Violet are back to chatting casually The plane
falls behind them Alice bursts out of her house just as--

The plane violently plummets to the ground out in the desert
by Oasis Alice gasps horrified

Bunny and Violet jump startled then turn behind them to
where Alice is looking but they don’t see anything Bunny
turns back worried--

BUNNY
What

ALICE
You didn’t see

Alice hesitates Bunny and Violet search her face
concerned For some reason she feels exposed

ALICE (CONTD)
I’m sorry I had a really weird
night I think it was a migraine
or something And I thought I
Saw Sorry

BUNNY
(deadly serious)
Don’t lie to us
(then)
You’re having an affair with the
bus driver

Violet laughs Alice forces a laugh

ALICE
I tried to deny it for so long

VIOLET
(trying too hard to get in
on the joke)
Your secret is safe with us
Violet sees something behind Alice and her face falls

VIOLET (CONTD)
Does she live right behind you

Alice and Bunny follow her gaze-- to Margaret who’s standing
in her yard just behind Alice’s

BUNNY
Yes lucky us

Margaret is staring at Alice Then she turns to look exactly
where the plane just crashed

Alice’s stomach drops She forces herself to look away from
Margaret putting on a cheery face

ALICE
Anyone headed to town

INT TOWN MARKET - DAY

Alice unloads her basket at the register zoning out She
picks up a BRIGHT RED APPLE studying its shine

MARKET CHECKOUT LADY
Anything I can help you with

Alice looks up at her

ALICE
Where does this come from

MARKET CHECKOUT LADY
The produce aisle

ALICE
No where does it actually come
from

The Market Checkout Lady looks at her blankly

ALICE (CONTD)
They ship all of this food in from
somewhere Where does it come
from Why can’t we grow it here

MARKET CHECKOUT LADY
Well we only want the best at
Oasis Our produce comes fresh
from all corners of the world--

ALICE
There are no living things here at
all No food no animals why
can’t we grow anything here

She gestures behind her and hits a GLASS BOTTLE which falls
SMASHING on the ground Everyone turns to stare at her
Alice reddens Everyone keeps staring at her

Suddenly the market starts RUMBLING with another TREMOR
There’s a quiet ROAR of glass and tin and packaging as all
the goods in the market shake

Then the lights begin FLICKERING Suddenly all the EMPLOYEES
and CHILDREN in the store turn and look at Alice They open
their mouths HIDEOUSLY WIDE-- but instead of a scream a
terrible screeching electronic sound comes out

The rumbling stops even more suddenly than it started
Everyone looks normal again The other Housewives adjust
themselves then head back to their shopping

VOICE OVER LOUDSPEAKER (0S)
Hold on to your hats ladies That
was a little bigger than we’re used
to But at these prices our Betty
Crocker cake mix is gonna be flying
off the shelves no matter what

Alice leaves her basket at the register and runs outside

INT KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACKS HOUSE - DAY
Alice pours herself a glass of water trying not to freak

out She’s about to drink-- then stops putting the glass
back on the counter staring at it Then she looks outside

EXT BACKYARD - ALICE AND JACKS HOUSE - DAY

Alice walks to the fence dividing her yard from Margaret’s

ALICE
Margaret
(then)
Are you home

She hears a strange sound Then hears it again-- it’s coming
from above Alice looks up

Margaret is standing on her own roof

ALICE (CONTD)
(alarmed)
Margaret What are you doing

Margaret looks down at her Smiles Spreads her arms And
falls forward off the roof

ALICE (CONTD)
NO NO NO--

Alice flinches and turns away just as Margaret’s body lands

on the spikes of the WHITE PICKET FENCE with a horrifying
SQUELCH She looks back to see the bright red blood

splatters across the fence and the roses
Alice SCREAMS She moves toward Margaret--

When suddenly her feet are off the ground-- a MAIL MAN has
appeared and picked her up pulling her away from the body

Alice flails as more SERVICE MEN -- a MILK MAN a GARBAGE
MAN a DELIVERY MAN -- suddenly appear around Margaret
tending to her and the Mail Man drags Alice away

INT LIVING ROOM - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Alice and Jack are mid-argument Alice is pacing heated

JACK
You need to settle down--

ALICE
There is no way she’s fine

JACK
I don’t know what to tell you
Ted’s with her at the hospital
right now he said she just needs a
few stitches

ALICE
Ted is lying to you She jumped
She did it on purpose--

JACK
She slipped cleaning the window
It was an accident

ALICE
Jack I saw her I saw her hit
that fence

JACK

You probably saw what you were
worried would happen--

ALICE JACK (CONTD)
(shaking her head) She fell and you imagined the
No No-- worst case scenario--

ALICE (CONTD)
I heard it I heard her body
break

JACK
Please don’t get dramatic

ALICE
She wanted me to see

JACK
Alice stop

ALICE
Why would they lie about what
happened What are they hiding
There’s something off here there’s
something wrong--

JACK
Don’t do this

ALICE
What are you doing at Oasis

JACK
You know what I do I’ma
technical engineer

ALICE
But you don’t know what they’re
doing What the effects of their
work might be on the people who
live here or the land--

JACK
STOP IT

His tone startles her He’s genuinely mad

JACK (CONTD)
Do you know how hard I’ve worked to
get here I’m finally at the
precipice of something and you are
risking everything What do you
need Attention What more can I
give you You’re acting
delusional

He reaches for her bandage Alice pulls her hand away--

ALICE
No--

Jack pins her and RIPS it off to see-- the wound is gone
Completely There’s no black there’s not even a scar

JACK
You are fine You’re fine

Alice stares at it astonished
JACK (CONTD)
You have to get a hold of yourself
Do not do this to me
He has to stop himself from going farther and marches off
pissed Alice stands there reeling

INT KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alice stands in the kitchen in her nightgown staring out the
window toward Margaret’s house

She walks past Jack sleeping on the couch She stops looks
at him for a beat and keeps going

EXT STREETS - NIGHT

Alice’s barefoot feet walk the empty moonlit streets of
Oasis

EXT HIGH DIVE - COUNTRY CLUB - NIGHT

Alice climbs the ladder to the top of the HIGH DIVE

She reaches the top and walks carefully out to the edge of
the diving board

She closes her eyes and spreads her arms the way Margaret did
just before she jumped

Suddenly-- the POOL LIGHTS COME ON It startles Alice who
suddenly realizes the pool below her is empty It’s been
drained of water it’s just a concrete pit

She loses her balance falling off the board-- she tumbles
through the air toward the concrete--

SMACK

EXT UNDERWATER - NIGHT
Alice hits the surface of the water with a violent SLAP

She twists underwater screaming

EXT COUNTRY CLUB POOL - DAY

Alice surfaces taking in a breath She’s just been swimming
laps in the club pool She climbs out and walks over to
Bunny Violet Peg and Shelley and a few other HOUSEWIVES are
having a boozy lunch lounging in chairs by the pool

PEG
--PJ still fits into the pants I
bought him last Christmas

SHELLEY
I don’t ever want them to grow up
This is the cutest age

Alice takes a towel drying herself off

SHELLEY (CONTD)
Youll see Alice Once you have
kids you wont even be able to
remember your life before them

Bunny watches Alice cautiously as Shelley stretches
luxuriously in the sun

SHELLEY (CONTD)
How lucky are we ladies Our men
lug off to work all day and we get
to lounge by the pool We can’t
ever let them figure out how much
weve got it made

The other women laugh Alice doesn’t

SHELLEY (CONTD)
Seriously though Out there we
couldn’t live like this Hopefully
soon the whole world will look like
Oasis

ALICE
Have you ever left Shelley

Everyone turns to Alice surprised

SHELLEY
What do you mean

ALICE
Since you’ve been here Have you
left Gone on vacation

SHELLEY
(laughs gesturing around)
Why would I need a vacation

PEG
Oh my God

She points to the other side of the club The other women
jump up squealing excitedly At first Alice can’t see what
they’re looking at but the crowd parts and she realizes--

It’s Margaret

And she looks completely fine Better than fine-- sublime
Shes glowing happy basking in everyone’s attention
totally different from how we’ve seen her before

Alice’s heart pounds She grabs a towel and walks over to
the crowd Margaret’s bouncy and bright as she recounts her
saga to an eager audience

MARGARET
It was mortifying I tore my
dress the mail man found me--

VIOLET
You look amazing

MARGARET
Thank you

Margaret stares at Violet not remembering her

SHELLEY
That’s Violet honey

MARGARET

Violet Of course

(then apologetic)
I’m having trouble remembering but
I know I need to apologize for the
way I’ve been behaving since

(then)
Ted told me some of the things I’ve
done and--

SHELLEY
Please We’re just happy to have
you back

MARGARET

Dr Collins is a miracle worker
Ten stitches and an icepack--

ALICE
Margaret

She says it a little too sharply a little too loudly The
other women jump surprised

ALICE (CONTD)
Can I talk to you for a second

AWAY FROM THE OTHERS

Alice pulls Margaret a few feet away from the other women
trying to stay calm as she whispers

ALICE
What the hell happened

MARGARET
I was trying to clean the outside
of our windows like an idiot-—-

ALICE
Why are you acting like this

MARGARET
Like what

ALICE
Margaret
(searching her face)
You jumped

Margaret laughs

MARGARET
I wish I’d jumped I would’ve
landed better

ALICE
You looked at me And you hit the
fence there was blood everywhere
it wasn’t just ten stitches-—-

Margaret looks back at the other women and gives them a
weird almost “help me” look That snaps something in Alice
She grabs Margaret’s arm hard

ALICE (CONTD)
I know you’re lying

MARGARET
I’m going to get some lunch--

Margaret tries to get her hand away but Alice won’t let go
Shelley walks over warm but discreet

SHELLEY
Alice are you all right

ALICE
Tell me the truth

A COUNTRY CLUB STAFF MEMBER approaches

COUNTRY CLUB STAFF MEMBER
Ma’am please take this elsewhere
or well be forced to call your
husband

SHELLEY
Honey why don’t you get out of the
sun for a bit I think it’s
getting to your head

Alice realizes that everyone is watching her Bunny gives
her a “what are you doing” look Alice drops Margaret’s
hand and clears her throat walking away

INT PHONE BOOTH - COUNTRY CLUB - DAY
Alice takes a slip of paper out of her bag It’s a phone
number “emergencies only” Alice dials and waits as it

rings her face oddly determined Finally someone answers

ALICE
Jack

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

CLOSE on the DIAL of a BLOOD PRESSURE CUFF tightening around
Alice’s arm A nervous Jack and Alice sit with DR COLLINS
(50s cheerful patronizing)

JACK
Is there a bug going around

DR COLLINS
Not that I know of I think this
is just run-of-the-mill exhaustion
(removing the cuff)
Have you had any new stresses or
pressures lately

ALICE
No

JACK
She saw Ted’s wife Margaret fall
Maybe it’s shock

DR COLLINS
That was quite a tumble She was
so embarrassed

ALICE
What exactly happened to her

DR COLLINS
Pardon

ALICE
I know she got ten stitches Where
were they Where did she hurt
herself

Dr Collins laughs good-naturedly

DR COLLINS
You wouldn’t want me sharing
details of your treatment with
other patients would you
(then)
I’m gonna prescribe the same pills
we gave you before

ALICE
I don’t think I need those They
made me groggy I couldn’t think

DR COLLINS
They’re precautionary To keep you
calm

JACK
How long would she have to take
them Just a few days

ALICE
Could it be something in the water

DR COLLINS
(a beat)
The water

ALICE
Or the air Or whatever causes
those earthquakes

Dr Collins just watches her for a beat Then

DR COLLINS
Hmm

ALICE
What

DR COLLINS
Margaret asked me that same
question

His voice technically sounds the same but something in the
room has shifted

DR COLLINS (CONTD)
She was also having trouble
sleeping Are you having any
trouble sleeping Any bad dreams

He clicks his pen to take notes Alice steals a glance at
Jack They’re both suddenly on high alert A record of
Alice behaving like Margaret isn’t something either of them
want

ALICE
No Nothing like that
(then carefully)
Youre probably right I’m most
likely just exhausted

Dr Collins pats her knee

DR COLLINS
We’re gonna get you squared away
(standing)
You two lovebirds wait here and
Ill grab your medication Nurse
Collins will drive you home

NURSE COLLINS Dr Collinss Head Nurse and wife appears
behind Dr Collins smiling happily

INT NURSE COLLINSS CAREXT STREET - DAY

Alice sits in the backseat head against the window as Nurse
Collins gets in the front seat She sits up when she sees--

Jack arguing with Dr Collins in the parking lot She
unrolls her window just able to faintly hear

DR COLLINS
Youre being reckless

JACK
It’s not necessary

Nurse Collins turns the ENGINE on drowning out the
conversation Alice tries to open the door but it’s locked

ALICE
I need to hop out for a second

NURSE COLLINS
(pleasantly)
Dr Collins said I was to take you
straight home

ALICE
It’s important I need to ask my
husband something

Alice yanks at the door Nurse Collins just smiles
NURSE COLLINS
Rest and relaxation that’s what

you need

ALICE
Please Please let me out--

NURSE COLLINS
Doctor’s orders

She drives away Alice turns around to watch Jack and Dr
Collins continue arguing as they get smaller in the distance

EXT ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DAY

Alice walks up to her front door Nurse Collins waits in her
car watching She doesn’t pull away until Alice is inside

EXT BACKYARD - ALICE AND JACKS HOUSE - DAY

Alice stands in her backyard staring at Margaret’s roof

She walks over toward the fence where Margaret fell Theres
no blood no marking no evidence at all Maybe she did
imagine it

She reaches out and touches the fence-- and when she brings
her fingers back they’re covered in wet white paint

The fence has been repainted
Alice stumbles back She wasn’t crazy

She turns to look toward Oasis Then she walks over to
Bunny’s yard trying to seem casual eyes darting around to
make sure she’s not being watched

One of Bunny’s kids BIKES has been discarded in the yard
Alice picks it up and is about to swing her leg over it when--

BUNNY’S SON FRED (0S)
(singing)
Merrily merrily merrily merrily

Bunny’s son Fred is swinging on their swing set his back to
Alice singing the same line over and over

BUNNY’S SON FRED (CONTD)
(singing)
Merrily merrily merrily merrily

Alice looks around but it seems like no one else is home
Fred’s alone Alice approaches him uneasy

ALICE
Honey Where’s your mom

BUNNY’S SON FRED
(singing)
Merrily merrily merrily merrily

ALICE
Fred--

She touches his shoulder to stop him swinging He turns to
her-- and his mouth opens in a horrifying scream emitting
the same terrible electronic screech she heard in the market

Alice staggers back He reaches for her hand sweetly but
Alice backs away scared and jumps on the bike furiously
pedaling away

EXT ROAD - DAY

Alice bikes down the empty road toward Oasis Headquarters
the town disappearing behind her

EXT OASIS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Alice pedals on dead-tired legs finally here She drops the
bike it’s wheels still spinning on the ground

She walks up to the doorway She looks around takes a deep
breath steels herself and pushes the door open and we SMASH
CUT TO--

HER PUPIL DILATING --

AND IT’S SENSORY OVERLOAD AGAIN

Were in ALICE’S POV-- the lights are too bright moving and
flashing-- everything’s too loud--

Then lights and colors start to come into focus She slowly
takes in her surroundings IMAGES are being projected on to
Alice and the PLASTIC CURTAINS surrounding what feels like a
little corner of the room

She’s lying on a bed in a white nightgown She’s paler
gaunt not in 50’s style Two IV’s run from her arm to a
simple machine with an elegant screen She slowly sits up
blinking in the chaos of the images trying to make them out

Some of them are 1950s advertisements A man blowing
cigarette smoke into an eager woman’s face Blow in her face
and she’ll follow you anywhere A husband hugging his
embarrassed wife Don’t Worry Darling You Didn’t Burn the
Beer A wife bent over her husband’s knee his arm raised to
spank her If he finds out you didn’t buy Sanborn

The ceiling is covered in moving black-and-white patterns--
which she realizes are Busby Berkeley dancers These are the
same dancers from her dreams

Alice’s head spins She struggles to move like a fawn
discovering its limbs She’s restrained by the IV’s in her
arm and another cord-- running up to a small white implant
attached to her skull just under her ear

Alice pulls at the cords alarmed Then she notices an
elegant IPAD-LIKE DEVICE resting on top of the machine she’s
connected to She picks it up-- it’s monitoring information
of some kind It looks medical

In the corner is a photo ofherself A small one like an
Avatar She looks different in a way she can’t describe

She touches it-- and the screen CHANGES Two photos show up
a MAN and WOMAN captioned “NEW USERS BOB AND KATHY” Alice
stares at the device like it’s witchcraft

She touches it again-- and a VIDEO starts playing It’s the
tourism video from the opening just where we left it a
group of FRIENDS drinking and laughing by the pool just as
Frank walks onscreen Alice jumps back at the sight of him

FRANK

It may be remote but we have a
feeling that once you arrive
youll never want to leave

Youve passed multiple background
and psychological tests and have
proven your dedication and loyalty
to our cause and way of life

Alice looks around the room panicking Where the fuck is
she She studies the machine -- it’s too hard to read DOTS
and charts everywhere--

FRANK (CONTD)
But this acceptance is not tenured
There are rules and punishments if
you or your loved one breaks those
rules You can move up in our
organization by recruiting others
to join our community--

She tries to stand but her legs are so weak that when she
puts pressure on her right foot her ankle TWISTS She
falls hitting her head on the machine behind her on the way
down and PASSING OUT COLD as we CUT TO--

UNDERWATER

The rippling surface of a body of water

REVEAL Alice is underwater eyes wide terrified She opens
her mouth to breath realizes she can’t and sits up--

INT BATHROOM - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

In her bathtub gasping for a breath She pants choking on
air fighting tears as she feels her body tries to
understand where she is and what just happened--

A happy Jack enters in a TUXEDO buttoning his cuffs--

JACK
I might ask Shelley to dance at
some point if it feels like the--

He stops surprised when he sees her in the tub

JACK (CONTD)
How long do you need to get ready
We’re gonna be late

Alice catches her breath leaning back covering her face
She manages to nod Jack takes her in still awed by her

JACK (CONTD)
You look incredible
(then mischievous)
I’ve been thinking we should try
something kind of crazy

He squeezes her thigh rubs his hand down it Alice can’t
even think about sex right n--

JACK (CONTD)
Let’s have a baby

He couldn’t have stunned her more if he’d smacked her

ALICE
What

JACK
I mean not right this second
obviously we don’t have time
ButI love you and I want more
of you and now I think I want a
little you I don’t know It’d be
an adventure

He stands and starts to leave then stops remembering

JACK (CONTD)
Oh here

He hands her -- a pill Alice stares at him for a beat then
takes it and puts it in her mouth

As soon as he’s gone she spits out the pill and pulls the
bath’s plug letting it dissolve as the water drains

She submerges herself back underwater as we CUT TO--

A SINGERS FACE

On stage in a spotlight performing into a microphone We
are

INT “DOLL HOUSE” NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

This is the biggest event of the year-- a boisterous rowdy
black tie affair The whole town is here drinking and
dancing and letting loose

A classic 50’s BIG BAND led by the singer plays in the
iconic CLAMSHELL stage in front of a small dance floor the
rest of the room filled with beautifully-set tables

Alice and Jack walk in Alice is overwhelmed by the room--
everything is too loud too much She clutches Jack’s arm
trying not to panic anxious and paranoid

AT THEIR TABLE

Alice and Jack arrive to cheers from Bunny and Dean Peg and
Peter and Violet and Bill This is the fun table already
deep into their drinks Peter and Peg dance in place as
Bunny has Violet twirl to show off her dress

BUNNY
How good does that look on her
Bill better watch out It fits
better than it did in the store

Violet blushes pleased as Peg looks between them

PEG
You guys went shopping together
All of you As a group
(too brightly)
That’s fun

Dean is making Bill chug from a bottle of champagne He
chokes on the bubbles but keeps going spilling on his shirt
Jack cheers him on as he hands Alice a glass of champagne
She takes it just to hold something as--

SHELLEY (0S)
Here are the troublemakers

Shelley walks up making the rounds

SHELLEY (CONTD)
I don’t know how we’re allowed to
put you all at one table

JACK
It’s probably better for insurance
purposes

Shelley touches Alice’s arm softly

SHELLEY
Alice how are you feeling

Shelley says it pleasantly but it feels loaded

ALICE
I’m great

SHELLEY
If I hear glass breaking I’m
coming right here

Everybody laughs too hard as Shelley moves on to the next
table Alice watches her go-- then sees Margaret giggling
and flirting with Ted charming everyone at their table
Teds beaming relaxed back in everyone’s good graces

She watches Margaret kiss Ted on the cheek and walk over to
the BAR Alice turns to Jack shouting over the music

ALICE
Ill be right back

BY THE BAR

Margaret takes two drinks from the bartender just as Alice
walks up behind her Margaret turns and sees her trapped

MARGARET
Oh hi I’m just going to bring
these back to Ted--

ALICE
You can tell me whatever’s going
on

Alice is trying to look her in the eye but Margaret won’t
hold her gaze

ALICE (CONTD)
(quietly)
I do have bad dreams I know
they’re hiding something I know
something’s out there What are
they making you cover up

Margaret’s looking at Alice the way they all used to look at
Margaret like her crazy might be contagious

MARGARET
I need to go find my husband

Margaret walks away Alice turns back to see Jack has been
watching the whole thing He looks disconcerted

Suddenly the BAND PLAYS A HEROIC CUE because Frank has
walked on stage taking the mic to say a few words Alice
walks back to her table sitting close to Jack

FRANK
Just wanted to say thank you to
everyone for coming out This is
my favorite night of the year I
love being all together under one
roof I love seeing who can no
longer fit in their tuxedos but
mostly I love looking back on how
far we’ve come

Alice looks around the room Everyone is watching Frank with
total devotion They’re all enraptured

FRANK (CONTD)

It’s amazing to see how much we’ve
grown And I’m happy to say that
were still growing even tonight
Weve set the bar terribly high for
their first night in town but I’d
like to take this opportunity to
introduce our newest hire and his
beautiful wife Bob and Kathy King

An elated man BOB and his sheepish wife KATHY walk out
holding hands waving to everyone The room applauds warmly

Alice’s stomach drops
These are the people from the “NEW USER” photo she saw
Alice grabs Jack’s arm hard

ALICE
Jack I need to go home

JACK
What We just got here

FRANK
(to Bob and Kathy)
Welcome to Oasis We do this every
Saturday

The crowd LAUGHS -- and suddenly they all have no teeth It
looks horrifying Alice is spinning out She squeezes her
eyes shut-- when they open everyone looks normal again She
grabs Jack again--

ALICE
We need to get out of here

JACK
Well get you a drink

Frank’s watching them He grins

FRANK
Now if I could have Jack come up
here for a minute

Jack blinks startled Their whole table is amazed Alice
grabs his hand distressed whispering to him--

ALICE
Please Please let’s just go

Jack looks from Alice to Frank beckoning him on stage He
looks at her like “what am I supposed to do” Then pulls his
hand away jumping to his feet and hurrying to the stage

ALICE (CONTD)
(desperate)
Jack

Alice watches helplessly as Jack hops on stage next to Frank
He’s blushing jittery with nerves

FRANK
Bob’s going to have big shoes to
fill He’1ll be taking over for
Jack as I’m pleased to announce
that Jack is being promoted to
Senior Technology Manager

Their table erupts in CHEERS Jack shakes Frank’s hand
giddy Alice starts hyperventilating She can’t catch her
breath She runs out of the room Bunny watches concerned

INT BATHROOM - DOLL HOUSE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Alice pushes open the bathroom door still gasping A beat
later Bunny follows her in--

BUNNY
What has gotten into you Jack--

Alice grabs her wild and desperate

ALICE
Something bad is happening
Something is deeply deeply wrong
with this town And with Frank
Oasis is doing something wrong or
it’s covering up something wrong--

Bunny’s momentarily stunned by Alice’s intensity

BUNNY
Okay slow down--

INT “DOLL HOUSE” NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
Back in the main room Frank still has Jack on stage
FRANK
Now I heard there’s a special way
Jack likes to celebrate good news

The band starts playing a SONG Jack laughs embarrassed--

JACK
No No way

FRANK
I’ve heard you’re the best

Jack shakes his head secretly loving this Then he starts
to tap dance to the music His table ERUPTS delighted
Jack begins to perform a full choreography He keeps an eye
on Frank desperate to please him Frank watches happily

INT BATHROOM - “DOLL HOUSE” NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Alice is exploding with everything she’s been holding in
frantically trying to explain--

ALICE
I went to Oasis--

BUNNY

ALICE BUNNY (CONTD)
And when I walked inside I You walked inside What are

ALICE (CONTD)
It wasn’t even inside I woke up in
another room And I was connected
to a machine like it was an
experiment and there was a video
with Frank Frank was there and
there was a photo of that couple
out there and it said “new users”--—

Bunny takes her hand trying to calm her down

BUNNY
That was probably a dream Jack
must’ve mentioned the new couple
or you saw a photo of them and
didn’t remember--

ALICE
Margaret should not be okay and
she’s acting like she’s fine and
they’re all covering it up

Bunny’s starting to get scared for her friend

INT “DOLL HOUSE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Jack keeps dancing really throwing himself into it sweating
and struggling a bit Frank watches from the side

INT BATHROOM - DOLL HOUSE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

reason We can’t trust him

Bunny groans as she looks for the headlight switch -- but she
turns them off and they’re enveloped in darkness

INT “DOLL HOUSE” NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

The crowd is riveted by Frank Jack doesn’t take his eyes
off of him

FRANK
We’re here because we know we don’t

world convinces itself is important
or right You all worked so hard
to get here and I picked each of
you I chose you And not just
because of your talent and drive

Alice walks to the back of the car She opens the trunk and
takes out a CROWBAR

tightly and pushes the door open entering--

INT OASIS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

the Oasis lobby There’s no blinding light or crazy

noises or sensory deprivation they’re just inside the dark
clinical LOBBY of a government building

the empty FRONT DESK and frozen ESCALATORS leading below

Alice can’t believe it She walks outside to try again--

ALICE
Come back out Maybe we didn’t--

BUNNY
Alice

ALICE
(realizing)
Frank did this

BUNNY

Alice stops Bunny grabs her hand and looks her in the eye
empathetic but firm--

You need to get a hold of yourself

ALICE
This isn’t--

BUNNY

the pills again and see--

ALICE
It’s not like last time--

BUNNY
We should not be here You
shouldn’t have dragged me into

coming with me Get in the car

She kisses him then swings her leg around to straddle him
Jack breaks the kiss to check his watch--

JACK
What time is it I don’t--

Alice kisses him again She’s turning this from a goodbye
kiss into sex

ALICE
We’re a team right

JACK

INT KITCHEN - ALICE AND JACKS HOUSE - NIGHT

Alice prepares appetizers in the kitchen chopping planning
until--

FRANK (0S)
I learned something very exciting

Frank is standing in her kitchen He pops an appetizer in
his mouth and leans against the counter casually Alice puts
on a calm chipper face

ALICE
(brightly)
What do you mean

FRANK
Rumor is that you and Jack are
trying

It takes all of Alice’s effort to keep her face bright

ALICE
Well we’ll see

FRANK
I also heard you and Bunny took a
little trip last night

Alice stops dead Frank just grins at her

FRANK (CONTD)
Don’t worry You’re not in
trouble
(then)
I’m sorry it was just the boring
lobby But I couldn’t let you exit
three times

He grins and pops another appetizer in his mouth as Alice’s
insides go cold He studies her face intrigued

FRANK (CONTD)
No one else has ever tried Or
even asked the questions I’ve
been waiting for someone like you
(then)
And yet you’re still in here
preparing dinner like a good girl

He shrugs Before Alice can respond Shelley walks in

SHELLEY
There you are You have to see the
rest of the house It’s so cute

FRANK
Take me on a tour

SHELLEY
What a perfect starter home And
plenty of space to grow

She winks at Alice as they walk out Alice stands there

INT DINING ROOM - ALICE AND JACKS HOUSE - NIGHT

Everyone’s still laughing and talking as they take their
seats to eat Jack pulls the chair at the head of the table
out for Frank to sit then hurries over to the other head of
the table He pulls a chair out for himself--

But Alice slides into it sitting at the head Jack’s
startled Everyone else exchanges glances alarmed

Alice just stares at Frank as Jack awkwardly takes the seat
beside her Dean tries to start up the conversation again

DEAN
Anyway then I bet Jack that he
couldn’t A gentleman’s bet--

JACK
He always exaggerates this part
You can’t believe a word he says--

Alice keeps watching Frank Getting more determined
BUNNY

He only really inflates stories
about his golf scores

JACK VIOLET
That is blasphemous-- Bill does that too

ALICE
Kathy where are you from

It cuts through all the other conversation Kathy’s a little
startled to be put in the spotlight

KATHY
Pardon

Alice looks at her warmly

ALICE
Where are you from

BOB
Philadelphia

VIOLET
(delighted)
I’m from Philadelphia

Alice doesn’t look away from Kathy
ALICE
Everyone here is from Philadelphia
or Baltimore or Boston Every
once and awhile Chicago Where
did you vacation last
Kathy looks at Bob

KATHY
Vacation

JACK
Is everybody good on drinks

ALICE
I could probably guess

She points to framed PHOTOS on the wall

ALICE (CONTD)
One of those places Right

The husbands exchange looks Jack her a look like “what the
hell are you doing”

JACK
Honey maybe you want to lay down--
A smiling

Frank holds up a hand quieting him

FRANK
I’m curious where she’s going with
this

Alice is trying to talk directly to the women

avoid her

Violet’s nervous

To Boston

He’s almostenergized

eyes

ALICE
We all share the same four or five
memories It’s like there are
different tracks We honeymooned
in Sea Island or the Poconos or
Niagara Falls

BILL
(trying to help)
I think those are popular honeymoon
destinations

ALICE
Violet where did you meet Bill

VOILET
On a train--

even as they

she doesn’t want to answer but she does

VIOLET ALICE

To Boston

ALICE (CONTD)
You dropped your ticket and he
picked it up and gave it to you
(then)
That’s how Peg met Peter And how
Debbie McIntyre met her husband
There are only so many different
stories we’re told We’re told
what we remember We’re given
those memories

FRANK
Is memory problems a symptom you’ve
experienced before Alice

Ready for a challenge Alice

ignores him trying to make eye contact with the women--

ALICE
Try and remember something from
before you came to Oasis
Something that’s just yours

FRANK
A symptom of your other issues

Jack stares at his plate his leg bouncing rapidly trying
not to panic

FRANK (CONTD)
Dr Collins prescribed you
something for your mental health
didn’t he

ALICE
To distract me Because I was
realizing the truth

JACK
(pleading quietly)
Alice

FRANK
Because you’ve been having trouble
conceiving

Suddenly-- A BABY’S CRY Coming from the bedroom No one
else reacts-- no one else can hear it Only Frank looks
toward it He grins and it stops

Alice turns to the men

ALICE
He’s lying to you He’s using you
You don’t even know what he’s doing
there I’ve seen it I went to
Oasis--

The men all look at Frank disturbed and alarmed Jack looks
like he’s going to be sick

JACK
What

ALICE
And I saw that this isn’t real

FRANK
What does that even mean

She points to Bob and Kathy

ALICE
I saw them before they got here
It’s all planned It’s fake
Nothing in this place--
FRANK
This is all fake The food we’re
eating Am I fake

ALICE
I saw what he created where he
keeps us--

FRANK

I just want to follow your logic
Everything we’re seeing doesn’t
exist The townspeople the
houses the children The children
aren’t real

Everyone stops Bunny finally looks up

FRANK (CONTD)
Are Bunny’s children real

ALICE
He’s trying to turn us against each
other--

FRANK

They’re not right If this is all
some fake alternate universe
Otherwise it doesn’t make sense

ALICE
Try and remember anything outside
of this Anything besides what
Frank has told you--

FRANK
I’ve invented all of this so
Bunny’s children aren’t real

ALICE
Yes because none of it--

BUNNY
ENOUGH

Bunny looks up at Alice hard Then

BUNNY (CONTD)
Dean I’m ready to go

For once Dean is speechless He stands and hurries
follow Bunny out the door

FRANK
Have a good night Bunny

to

ALICE
Bunny-- please-- this is what he’s
trying to do--

FRANK
I don’t know why she’s so upset
with me

CRASH Alice angrily shoves her plate and glassware off the
table shattering on the ground The others jump startled

A beat

FRANK (CONTD)
Jack I think you may have over-
served your wife

Jack stands so quickly he almost knocks his chair over

JACK
Yes I think-- Thanks for coming--

The others jump to their feet desperate to escape They
avoid eye contact as they hurry to the door Frank just
sits watching Alice almost pleased She’s shaking

Finally Frank stands and calmly walks out behind the others

INT DINING ROOM - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alice hasn’t moved from the table She hears Jack saying
goodbye to the last guests murmuring apologies Then the
sound of the door closing Jack stomps back in-- for maybe
the first time he’s truly angry at her

JACK
What the fuck was that

ALICE
I wanted to tell you--

JACK
Are you trying to get me fired
Do you want me to lose my job I
can’t-- I don’t even--

ALICE
Jack I need you--

JACK
You went to Oasis Do you have
any idea how dangerous that is
Alice grabs him the truth spilling out

ALICE
I saw a plane crash I saw a plane
crash in the desert and I went to
help and there was no one there I
was looking for help and that’s
when you found me on the couch

JACK
(realizing)
That was a week ago How could you
hide that from me

ALICE
And since then it’s like this
reality is falling apart And last
week I went again and I saw it I
saw whatever Frank is doing he’s
trapping us here This town is
rotten the children and the
employees their faces disappear
it’s like I can see through them--

Jack falls into a chair rubbing his head

JACK
Honey Honey

ALICE
Jack what do they do What does
Oasis do

JACK
I don’t know I don’t know what
they do No one does We all have
a specific role but we don’t

She takes his head in her hands distraught
ALICE
Please baby I need you I need
you to believe me

Jack studies her face He’s almost crying

JACK
Okay

ALICE
--Okay
JACK
I believe you I love you So I
believe you

Alice releases a breath that’s almost a sob
relieved She throws her arms around him

JACK (CONTD)
You should have told me

ALICE
I’m sorry I’m sorry--

He pulls back distressed

JACK
Am I trapped

ALICE
What

JACK

I work at Oasis I live here But
I go into that building every day
I do whatever Frank wants me to do
Am I helping him

Alice takes his hand sad but determined
ALICE
Yes I think you all are without

even realizing--

JACK
Then what do we do

ALICE
We have to go We have to get out
of here

Jack looks sick but he nods

JACK
Okay Let’s go

ALICE
Okay

She jumps to her feet fueled by Jack and finally having a
plan Jack grabs her and kisses her hard

their headlights illuminating the house--

But then he just sits there Alice looks at him

ALICE

He’s not moving
JACK

ALICE
What
He starts crying
JACK

hard to keep this from happening

ALICE

The light from the headlights flickers Alice turns--

All of the other husbands are standing in front of their car

Alice SCREAMS as the men move methodically surrounding the

backseat but they open the door and grab her dragging her
out as she tries to fight back Jack just cries in the
drivers seat

CUT TO

INT 1950S HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Alice is strapped to a GURNEY struggling weakly clearly
drugged MALE DOCTORS surround her preparing to perform
ELECTRIC SHOCK THERAPY

The charge BUILDS and she’s SHOCKED--

And we see a FLASH of something-- Alice using an ELECTRIC
KEYCARD to BEEP herself past security

She’s SHOCKED--

And we see another flash-- Alice staring at herself in a
metal reflection looking totally different--

She’s SHOCKED-- and she looks up to see--

A FEMALE DOCTOR in a mask staring down at her The doctor
sighs and pulls the mask down-- it’s Alice A very 21st-
century Alice in scrubs looking defeated

ALICE
Fuck

Alice tosses her mask on the ground and marches out of the
OPERATING ROOM She BEEPS her keycard to walk through a
secure door and we follow her into the--

It’s a windowless chaotic grimy hospital NURSES and other
doctors step aside or quiet as she passes clearly
intimidated by her An INTERN attempts to catch up with her--

Alice steps on to an open ELEVATOR
ALICE

Ive been on for 36 hours I’m
done Find Feldstein

INT ELEVATOR —- DAY

As soon as the doors close Alice’s shoulders collapse She
undoes her ponytail rubs her temples stressed and
overwhelmed She doesn’t even notice that someone else is in

the elevator -- a schlubby PHARMACEUTICAL REP standing behind
a cart of products in the corner We don’t fully see him
but we can sense he’s watching her Finally

PHARMACEUTICAL REP
Crazy day

Alice gives him a polite smile -- the smile you give someone
you see every day but don’t have any desire to know

ALICE
Always

He hangs on her every word She doesn’t notice

PHARMACEUTICAL REP
You work too hard

Alice has turned back to her phone
PHARMACEUTICAL REP (CONTD)
You need somebody to take care of

you

She doesn’t respond She’s reading something Maybe she
didn’t hear him maybe she’s pretending she didn’t

DING The elevator reaches her floor He knows it’s where
she gets off that their time is up

PHARMACEUTICAL REP (CONTD)
Ill see you tomorrow

Alice waves still distracted by her phone

ALICE
Yep
She steps off the elevator and we finally see him -- 21st
century Jack -- watching her unblinking until the doors
close

INT 1950S HOSPITAL - NIGHT

One final SHOCK-- and Alice goes limp on the gurney

The doctors calmly roll her gurney out of the room past the
old-fashioned machines

CUT TO

INT STAIRWELL - DAY

We’re following a MAN close on his back as he climbs the
dark drab stairs He’s in a WINTER COAT and WHISTLING the
same tune we’ve heard Alice whistle We stay right on his
shoulder as he throws open a DOOR and continues down an--

APARTMENT HALLWAY

He pulls out a key and opens the door to 10B walking into--

AN APARTMENT

Were still behind him as he tosses his key into a dish by
the door and moves his way through the barren modest home

He reaches a bedroom door with an intense high-tech ELECTRIC
KEYPAD It’s out of place in the rest of the plain
apartment He types in a CODE and the door CLICKS open to a--

BEDROOM

We finally swing around to see this man from the front
it’s 21lst-century Jack

He’s still whistling as he passes an empty chair with an IPAD
resting on it to Alice’s and keeps walking toward an area
curtained-off in THICK PLASTIC CURTAINS Familiar images and
SOUNDS blare behind them He pulls back the curtains--

An unconscious Alice lays on the bed we’ve seen her wake
from Jack turns off the VIDEOS so she’s laying in silence

Jack picks up the iPad with Alice’s avatar and clicks
something A message pops up REBOOT 100 DOWNLOADED READY
FOR FULL RESET

Across the room Alice’s eyes open She’s awake She
struggles to move but she can’t Her eyes dart around the
room desperate She watches Jack work the iPad as he
WHISTLES that same tune He turns back-- she closes her
eyes pretending to be unconscious again

Jack stands over her studying her He looks almost
crestfallen Then he grabs both of her legs

He slowly starts moving them in circles as if she was
pedaling a bike -- he’s stretching her muscles

JACK
I’m so sorry baby You’1ll
remember the essentials And we’1ll
get back to where we were in no
time We’1ll get to fall in love
all over again

Finally he drops her legs and walks over to the iPad He
clicks “BEGIN REBOOT” and turns back-- she quickly closes her
eyes again Jack touches her leg lovingly

JACK (CONTD)
Here we go See you at home

The machine BEEPS and Alice’s entire body SEIZES She’s being
reset Jack walks back over to his CHAIR He connects his
own IMPLANT DEVICE to the machine lays down closes his
eyes and--

EXT ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DAY

The sun BEAMS as Jack opens the passenger side door of his
convertible helping Alice out of the car Bunny watches
from next door as she trims her roses gasping delightedly
when she sees it’s Alice Jack calls over to Bunny--

JACK
Look who’s feeling better

Alice swats him lovingly

ALICE
Don’t shout it to the whole
neighborhood

JACK
Oh I put it in the paper And
there’s a radio announcement later--

She goes to swat him again but he catches her hand
flirtatiously She’s bright happy-- not fake necessarily
but like herself in the beginning

BUNNY
HALLELUJAH

Jack and Alice walk over to Bunny She leans over the hedge
to hug Alice grabbing her tight--

BUNNY (CONTD)
I missed you so much I started
writing my gossip in a journal

Alice laughs Bunny takes her in

BUNNY (CONTD)
How are you

ALICE
I’m good
(then almost prepared)
I’m having a hard time remembering
things but I know that I must have
behaved--

BUNNY
Stop I’m just glad you’re back

She squeezes Alice’s hand Alice squeezes back gratefully

JACK
I told the guys I’d meet them on
the course Why don’t you two
catch up while I play 18

BUNNY
Yes please Play 36 Play 72

Alice makes a face Bunny clarifies
BUNNY (CONTD)
Sit and drink and look at my
plants

ALICE
Oh yes please

EXT BUNNY AND DEAN’S BACKYARD - DAY

Alice and Bunny sit in Bunny’s backyard drinking and
laughing as Bunny fills her in on the town gossip

BUNNY
Peg’s face got so red I thought it
might actually pop off

ALICE
Peg is

BUNNY
Peter’s wife Always pregnant
Inexplicably annoying

ALICE
Yes of course

BUNNY
It’ll come back to you

Bunny’s trying for cheer but there’s something sad behind
it They’re interrupted by childish SQUEALS-- Bunny’s kids
Hank and Fred sprint into the backyard wobbling beneath the
weight of their bags
BUNNY’S SON HANK
(delighted)

MISS ALICE
They jump into Alice’s lap Alice looks at Bunny happily
surprised by the reaction Bunny laughs suddenly so flooded
with relief to have her friend back she almost cries

CUT TO

ECU of a NEEDLE landing in the groove of a record

INT VARIOUS - ALICE AND JACKS HOUSE - DAY

Alice is back in her element tackling her housework like a
machine She SCRUBS-- DUSTS-- SNAPS laundry straight--

She starts absent-mindedly WHISTLING the song she had in her
head-- the one Jack whistles in the real world

She stops dead in her tracks We PUSH IN on her as she goes
completely still
INT FOYER - ALICE AND JACKS HOUSE - DAY
Jack walks in sweaty and happy golf bag over his shoulder
Alice is waiting for him holding a COCKTAIL in a HIGHBALL
GLASS a perfect pout on her lips An incredible LUNCH sits
on the table behind her
ALICE
I figured you’d have worked up an

appetite

Jack drops his bag thrilled to be home
INT DINING ROOM - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - DAY
Jack rubs Alice’s feet in his lap as they eat

JACK

This is amazing Are there more
potatoes

ALICE
Yes I’ll get you some--

She starts to stand but Jack stops her
JACK
Don’t get up I can get it You
made this whole spread Let me
take care of my wife

Jack grins But he doesn’t move He looks down

ALICE
What’s wrong

JACK
I don’t--

He goes to move again but nothing happens

JACK (CONTD)
My legs

ALICE
Baby

JACK
I can’t move my legs

ALICE
Just your legs

His eyes go wide and he looks up scared

JACK
Or my arms

ALICE
Good It should be limbs first
Then general motor functions

JACK
-what

concerned

She places her old bottle of pills now EMPTY on the table

ALICE

Don’t worry darling It’s just
the sedative you’ve been trying to
force down my throat 500
milligrams should knock you out
without stopping your heart

(then)
Hopefully My math could be wrong

JACK
How do you know that

ALICE
Because I’m a fucking doctor

Jack blinks Then PASSES OUT

CUT TO BLACK

INT DINING ROOM - ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

SLAP Jacks startled awake by Alice’s hand smacking him
across the face He tries to get his bearings-- his arms and
legs are tied to the chair Alice is eating the cake she
prepared for desert straight from the pan

ALICE
What’s wrong sweetie Did you
have a nightmare

JACK
Alice What are you doing

Alice picks up the pill bottle admiring it

ALICE
I have to admit I wasn’t sure this
would work But the mistake you
idiots made was in making
everything here real Food gets
you full Alcohol gets you drunk
Pills knock you out

JACK
Honey you’re scaring me

ALICE
I know who you are I know what
you did to me Whatever you tried
to do whatever you did to

having

lunch

spots

HOUSEWIFE ON A WALK
I’m so happy they’re doing better

Jacks back is to them seemingly fine Alice
them and waves cheerfully

INT DINING ROOM - ALICE AND JACKS HOUSE - DAY

Alice’s fake cheer drops as she turns back to Jack

ALICE
Tell me where the exit is

JACK
Youre my wife I can help you--

Alice laughs

ALICE
Help me You’re sick You’re a
monster-—
JACK

JACK
Stop--

ALICE
You’re pathetic

JACK

your fucking property You keep me
locked in a cage--

Something snaps in Jack his face distorted with rage--

JACK
I SAVED YOU

He can’t control himself he’s so offended--

JACK (CONTD)
I brought you here to give you a
good life All I wanted to do was
make you happy You were miserable
and tired and lonely and I saved
you from that loneliness I’m the
only one who loves you enough to
take care of you I spent
everything I have on you

ALICE
How long have I been here

Jacks rage deflates He looks like he wants to cry

JACK
What does it matter You worked so
hard for what You were never
happy before but you are here
Youre happy with me

ALICE
Youre psychotic

She grabs

She holds

She holds

Alice hesitates

JACK
That’s not you talking That’s
society That’s your friends and
your peers and these bullshit
modern mind games you’re taught
You like it here

ALICE
It’s not real

JACK
What’s more real than this

ALICE
Anything Everything here is fake
Nothing’s alive

a knife Jack is suddenly scared

JACK
Whoa--

it against her neck--

ALICE
Margaret just came back like
nothing happened I could kill
myself and just wake up--

JACK

(frantic)
NO No no no Everyone only gets
one reset You and Margaret--

die in the simulation you won’t
wake up Please don’t hurt
yourself

the knife out to him

ALICE
Fine I’11 kill you

JACK
You can’t If a man dies in the
simulation he’1ll die in the real
world Id starve there’s no one
to take care of him I would
really die Please baby

Despite everything he has a pull on her
JACK (CONTD)

We love each other This isn’t
fake What we feel isn’t fake I
would rather be here with you than

anywhere else

She watches him for a beat

ALICE

Are they all like me
JACK

What
ALICE

The other wives Are they all

trapped here Is Bunny
JACK

Don’t worry about them

responsible for his own wife and

nothing else

ALICE

But she’s hooked up to a machine--

JACK

The women here have all been saved
The world out there is fucked
It’s full of hatred and violence

Frank

money to keep us here and I hate

get to

stay here We can stay here

And

that’s okay It’s okay to be happy

here With me Just think about
our life Think about what you

really want

Alice drains the rest of her drink
she’s maybe acquiescing

She looks torn

Like

JACK (CONTD)
I love you

ALICE
I don’t care

And Alice levels him with the HIGHBALL GLASS she’s holding
shattering it against his temple Blood splatters as his

chair topples over

EXT ALICE AND JACK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Through the picture window we see Alice standing over Jack’s
discarded chair although from the outside we can’t see what
she’s staring at

Then she walks out of frame and comes back holding one of
Jacks GOLF CLUBS She swings it up and WHACKS Jack over and
over blood splattering all over her dress

She walks out of frame again then comes back with a BROOM
She starts to clean up the mess

EXT STREET - DAY

Alice still covered in blood marches down her street
holding Jacks golf club She passes a car and swings the
club SMASHING the back window She winds up and SHATTERS a
mailbox then a front gate everything’s she’s passing

ALICE
We have to go right now

The commotion brings a HOUSEWIFE to her window A SECOND

HOUSEWIFE walks out of her front door her ANXIOUS HUSBAND
trying to keep her inside but she ignores him It’s like
they’re being drawn toward Alice

ALICE (CONTD)
We’re all prisoners here

Bunny comes to the window of her house watching She’s
scared for her friend but she can’t move

ALICE (CONTD)
We don’t have to live like this

Alice slows there’s a row of cars waiting to stop her like a
barricade Dr Collins steps out of one of the cars

VIOLET (0S)
Alice

Violet is standing in her own doorway alarmed She looks
toward the line of cars then beckons Alice toward her
opening her door Alice hurries toward her

INT VIOLET AND BILL’S HOUSE - DAY

Violet hurries Alice inside slamming the door behind her
Alice exhales relieved as Violet takes in her appearance

VIOLET ALICE
Whose blood is that Where’s Bill

VIOLET (CONTD)
I don’t know--

ALICE
We have to get the others If we--

She stops when she realizes Violet is staring at the floor
She looks terrified

VIOLET
I’m sorry I just want you to get
better

Alice turns confused--

Frank is sitting in Violet’s living room He grins Before
Alice can scream--

CUT TO BLACK

DR COLLINS (0S)
Alice

It’s SENSORY OVERLOAD again In ALICE’S POV lights and
sounds slowly come into focus She raises her arms-- they’re
tied down again But this time she’s in

INT PATIENT ROOM - HOSPITAL —- DAY

She’s strapped to a chair A blurry Dr Collins enters the
room sitting down next to her

DR COLLINS
It’s okay You’re okay

Alice SCREAMS pulling against her straps NURSE COLLINS
walks in to hold her down Dr Collins stays very calm

DR COLLINS (CONTD)
Alice Do you know where you are
Youve suffered a psychotic break

ALICE DR COLLINS (CONTD)
No no no no no-- Youre in the hospital Do
you remember what happened

DR COLLINS (CONTD)
Your hallucinations became violent

ALICE
I know you’re a part of this--
Frank uses you--

DR COLLINS
It’s important to establish reality
when coming out of something like
this I’m incredibly sorry to tell
you this But during the
episodeyou killed your husband

ALICE
He kidnapped me He trapped me
here this isn’t real-—-

DR COLLINS
Bunny told us about the delusions
youve been having The alternate
reality I wish I’d known I
failed you in your initial
diagnosis

He’s kind and sad and convincing Nurse Collins won’t look
at her Doubt starts creeping in

ALICE
I know this isn’t real

DR COLLINS

I should have recognized earlier
signs The stress and isolation
you were feeling I’ve seen
psychotic breaks like this in
housewives living in big cities
simply from the stress of home
life Adding the seclusion of
Oasis

ALICE
Jack admitted it to me He told me
everything

DR COLLINS
(kindly)
Youve hallucinated quite a bit
recently haven’t you Margaret’s
fall plane crashes distorted
faces

He shows her a photo It’s Jack’s bloody broken face the
shattered highball glass next to him He’s dead

ALICE
No that’s not

DR COLLINS
I’m truly sorry Alice I’ve given
a statement to the police
confirming your damaged mental
state and recommending you stay
here instead of any prison time

Alice takes the photo in her hand and sinks into her chair as
she realizes what she’s done

Then there’s a KNOCK at the door It’s Frank

Alice freezes But he just walks in and kneels kindly next
to her chair

FRANK
It’s going to be okay Alice
Were taking care of you now
Youll be safe with us

He touches her knee paternally
FRANK (CONTD)
Shelley and I are sending all our
thoughts and prayers

INT ROOM - HOSPITAL - DAY

Alice sits in her room Time has passed She’s a muted
version of herself drained of color and life

There’s a stir in the hallway At first Alice doesn’t
bother to turn around But then she recognizes the voice

BUNNY (0S)
I do have permission

It’s Bunny She’s a little more refined fancier
imposingshe looks more like Shelley She’s arguing with a
NURSE at reception

HOSPITAL NURSE
I’d need to ask Dr Collins

BUNNY

I wouldn’t have come all the way
down here it if wasn’t already
approved

(then)
I could call Shelley right now and
she can ask Frank directly Is
that what you’d like

HOSPITAL NURSE
(a little scared)
No No

BUNNY
Then I’1l see my friend now

INT ROOM - HOSPITAL - DAY

Bunny sits with Alice trying to stay upbeat despite their
surroundings She absent-mindedly arranges Alice’s things to
look a little nicer

BUNNY
This room isn’t bad
(then)
I’m sorry I havent been

ALICE
I understand

BUNNY
You should have told me it was such
a party

Alice manages a small smile Bunny takes her hand

BUNNY (CONTD)
Shall we go get some lunch

ALICE
I can’t

BUNNY
You can actually I got you a day
pass Let’s go into down We’ll
get some fresh air catch up on
gossipit’1ll be good for you

She tucks a strand of Alice’s hair behind her ear

BUNNY (CONTD)
Do they not have hair brushes here
Are they banned

Alice laughs despite herself

INT DEAN’S CAREXT ROAD - DAY
Bunny drives Alice stares out the window

BUNNY

Were basically Frank’s neighbors
which is sometimes more stressful
than fun But Dean takes the bus
in to work so I can have the car
during the day now which is nice
A little more freedom I can pick
up all my boyfriends

Alice leans her face against the window closing her eyes

INT DEAN’S CAREXT ROAD - DAY

Alice wakes as the car pulls to a stop She looks around
confused-- they’re in the middle of the desert parked just
before what looks like the edge of a cliff

BUNNY
We’re here

ALICE
Where

Bunny’s still staring straight ahead

BUNNY
I just wanted to take you on a nice
walk Get some air But I
couldn’t stop you I tried to get
help but it was too late You
jumped

ALICE
What are you talking about

BUNNY
This is the end

ALICE
The end of what

Bunny finally turns to look at her
BUNNY
I’m sorry Alice You were right
I know that now

Alice is gobsmacked

BUNNY (CONTD)
I wanted to ignore it I wanted you
to ignore it I made you think you
were crazy because I didn’t want
you to leave

ALICE
Bunny

BUNNY

You did something After you left
And I couldn’t ignore it anymore
This is the edge of what Frank
built It’s an exit

(then)
They don’t bother protecting it
because they don’t believe anyone
will be brave enough to jump

Alice looks out astounded Bunny did it She found a way

out She turns to Bunny electrified--

ALICE
Come with me We’1ll go together

Bunny clutches the wheel trying to keep it together

BUNNY
I can’t

ALICE
You have to I know it’s scary but
it’s worth it We can be free--

BUNNY
This is my life My kids

ALICE
Bunny this isn’t real This isn’t
all your life can be--

BUNNY
I’1l tell them I tried to stop you

She says it simply with no room for negotiation

Alice knows what Bunny’s doing for her She looks at the
edge then turns back to her friend

ALICE
I love you

They hug Bunny can’t look while Alice gets out of the car

EXT CLIFF - DAY
As soon as Alice is out of the car Bunny slowly pulls away

Alice waits a beat until Bunny is out of sight Then she
turns to the cliff

She stares down It’s a terrifying drop She takes a
breath smiles raises her arms and then LEAPS off of it

As Alice falls through the air--

CUT TO BLACK
