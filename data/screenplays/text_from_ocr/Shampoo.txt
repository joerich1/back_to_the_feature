DARK SCREEN - NOVEMBER 4th 1968

A darkness where even outlines are not discernible There is
a dim point of light coming from a dot on the HI-FI which is
PLAYING the BEACH BOYS When we could say good night and
still stay together wouldnt it be niiiice we could be

married then we could be happy wouldnt it be niiiiice
Through it there has been the SOUND of BANGING distinct and
rhythmic It GROWS LOUDER as the MUSIC ENDS There are also
WHIMPERING SOUNDS from a woman

FELICIAS VOICE
Oh no

GEORGES VOICE

FELICIAS VOICE
That headboard

GEORGES VOICE
Nobody can hear it

It BANGS a couple of more times

FELICIAS VOICE

It continues to bang until Felicia screams over the banging
of the headboard She follows the scream with a few yelps
Silence Now the SOUND of the PHONE RINGING

FELICIAS VOICE (CONTD)

for a lot of silly son of a bitches
that are out for themselves -- this

thing about it even if it does

I cant possibly imagine youll

What are you talking about

INT BISTRO - LESTER AND FELICIA

FELICIA
(she laughs)
-- think what you have time to
think Lester

Lester grabs her

LESTER
What are you talking about
Felicia

Suddenly theres a rumble in the room and East has stopped
chanting Several men have stepped to the center of the room
One of them in a slate suit raising both hands
DET YOUNGER
Excuse me Senator Ladies and
gentlemen were going to have to
evacuate this room as quietly and
quickly as possible Theres
nothing to worry about Wed like
you to exit through the door here
on my left down the steps into
the street please

There are whisperings and rumblings of a bomb and
rejoinders to the effect that its a hoax Nevertheless the
exodus begins and grows to bedlam Waiters who had been
fawning over jeweled ladies are now unceremoniously pushing
them down the stairs even going over them to make the
entrance

OUTSIDE

the emergency doesnt keep autograph hounds from inhibiting
the exit as they try to hold up celebrities in the crowd that
flows onto the street Jill and Johnny Pope are caught up in
the swirl of the crowd Pope temporarily loses Jill He looks
around Jill taps him on the shoulder

JILL
-- here I am Now what

Pope turns

POPE
Well -- as I see it weve got two
choices We can hang around here
and wait for the bomb to go off or
we can go to my party

JILL
Lets do that

Lester is with some security people trying to find out what
theyre doing

BG are several police cars a fire truck and the fire
truck ambulance Lights are flashing

LESTER
-- have they located it

Somebody shrugs A CAR HONKS Lester is pulled to the side
LESTER (CONTD)
(looking toward driver)

-- oh sorry

Then he sees its Felicia She gives him the finger and lays
rubber nearly sideswiping him
ONE OF THE SECURITY MEN
What was that all about

Somebody else says who was that Lester shrugs
INT SAMMYS HOUSE - GEORGE AND JACKIE

off his tie loose They are near the entryway and sitting on
a large staircase bg a young girl can be SEEN breast
feeding her baby

George and Jackie are obviously enjoying themselves The tape
ends Georges silk shirt is clinging down the center of his
back

He moves with Jackie where she picks up a coke at the bar

A black in a caftan with a huge Afro offers Jackie a joint
She takes a drags she and George move outside the living
room As they walk she hands the joint to George who hands
the joint to a couple of girls lying on a low couch by the
door -- all without really losing stride

OUTSIDE SAMMYS - NIGHT

Theres a long rolling lawn The lights are soft coming from
the living room the MUSIC more muted Jackie nevertheless
is breathing rather heavily from the dancing George is
looking at her intently too intently for her not to notice
She appears not to notice

GEORGE
What are you looking at

JACKIE
The lawn -- it looks like it goes

She turns back to George

Jackie looks past George into the living room

JACKIE (CONTD)
-- theres a lot of players in

The TWINS come up behind George and Jackie grabbing George
The move should be a little startling almost as if it were an
attack

TWIN ONE

They grab George and spin him around temporarily pushing
Jackie OUT OF SHOT

GEORGE

in the air and then it disappears
George looks surprised and disappointed
INT KITCHEN

Several tall stringy types are eating out of the
refrigerator with a couple of dogs eagerly watching others
are eating hash cakes off the formica counter

RED DOG sits in a corner sipping wine out of a measuring
cup He smiles and looks up to Jackie who has her arm on his
shoulder Strobe lights from an adjacent room can be SEEN

shakes through them moving to Jackie

GEORGE

in the rear of the house

EXT BISTRO PARKING LOT - JOHNNY POPE

The crowd has thinned out to a trickle but Popes red
Porsche is hemmed in by the fire trucks and a couple of other
cars

Pope is vainly trying to talk to firemen and policemen to
move their trucks and they keep referring him to someone
else

JILL AND LESTER
Lester stands swaying a little unsteadily in the lot The

Deputy secret service man seen twice earlier comes on up to
Lester

DEPUTY

Lester opens the car door and pulls back the seat He has a
hell of a time squirming into the back but tries to be
lighthearted about it Jill gets into the front

INT PORSCHE

The door on the drivers side is still open and Lesters feet
are poked out it His head is pushing on the canvas top

LESTER
See nothin to it

Jill turns and smiles but its a mistake since Lesters
upper body is almost leaning on her as it is Lester puts his
hand behind Jills head forcing her to hold the position
almost nose to nose with Lester

LESTER (CONTD)
What did you say your name was

sweetheart

JILL
Jill

LESTER

(not moving his head)
Jill

Jill cant really move her head back and Lester is obviously
captivated by Jills face

JILL
(trying to be casual)

LESTER
(still holding her)
Gee thats wonderful Jill
JILL
(very uncomfortable)

LESTER

(fondling her head moving
her closer)

feet hanging out the door

POPE (CONTD)
(another irritant)

Pope is furious He starts
jostling Lester around as

EXT FREEFORM SWIMMING POOL - JACKIE AND GEORGE - NIGHT

lie side by side on deck c

house and upper grounds are obscured by neat rows of hedges
and all sorts of random shrubbery Jackie and George watch
the Twins splash and flounce around in the jacuzzi with a

couple of androgenous men
arm in arm and half move

The Twins stand up in the jacuzzi
alf throw themselves to another

Jackie smiles She stretches yawns

splashing contest with the boys Water hits George and
Jackie Theyre hit again They shrug George rises takes
Jackies hand They walk on around the pool beside and along
a maze of hedgerows

EXT SAMMYS - THROUGH PORSCHE WINDOW

as the slow moving car catches the rolling lawn seen earlier
and the neat hedgerows which wind around the property

LESTER
Whose place is this

INT SAMMYS FOYER
by the open staircase Pope is greeting Sammy Introducing
Jill Sammys a tall Jesus figure with an Indian shirt that

goes to the knees on his levis

SAMMY
Sure I know Jill

Lester is staring in some wonder at the girl who is still
sitting on the staircase nursing her baby She looks up
smiles at Lester who manages a nod back doesnt take his
eyes off the sight

POPE
(noticing)
-- the bars in there Les

LES
(embarrassed)
-- oh fine

He strolls off toward the bar which is half visible through
the open foyer

AT THE BAR

where Jill and George were earlier Lesters ordered a drink
The huge black in the Afro offers him a toke Lester stares
at it dumbly

LESTER
(a little lamely
indicating drink
- Im

He takes his drink and half toasts the black He stops and
his eyes PAN the room Lester is virtually the only person on
his feet Everyone else is either on the floor or on deep
sofas side by side head to feet barely talking barely
moving In fact the most mobile thing in the room in smoke
from the joints

INT LIVING ROOM - LESTER

Lester shakes his head as if to clear it He takes a drink
and almost on cue the ACID ROCK MUSIC HITS and the strobe
lights go on

Lester is momentarily alarmed as if it had something to do
with his drink He manages to stagger out of the strobe light
effect hangs onto a railing in the next room

INT KITCHEN - JILL RED DOG AND POPE

Jill stands over Red Dog who hasnt moved an inch his
measuring cup of wine still half filled

Pope looks up sees Lester just outside the kitchen door

He points toward the kitchen door where Lester looks like

hes about to enter

Pope takes Jill and they move out the back door in the

direction of the rear grounds that Jackie and
taken earlier

LESTER

George had

peers into the kitchen Its filled mostly with unkempt

beards He decides against it turns up a sma

1 staircase and

continues up it until he finds himself in a den

Several people are seated on the floor quiet
watching television They seem a shade better
those in the kitchen

Lester squints at the set which is a little b

y smoking and
dressed than

urry and

partially blocked by someone sitting directly in front of

it He kneels by a fortyish man in a bush jac
pipe

LESTER
(whispering)
-- hows it going

INT DEN

MAN WITH PIPE
(quietly)
-- just fine

LESTER
(squinting to see)
-- is that Illinois

MAN WITH PIPE

Lester looks at the screen Sally handled by

et smoking a

bare arms is

being placed on a foam rubber cushion She laughs

LESTER
(dumbly)
-- Sally

MAN WITH PIPE
(pointing with his pipe
stem to a girl by
Lesters ear also
watching the set)
-- Sally

Lester looks at Sally She looks at Lester nods Turns back
to screen to watch herself Lester turns from Sally to see a
television camera and the foam rubber mattress now
abandoned Lester shakes his head

OUTSIDE ON GROUNDS WITH JILL AND JOHNNY POPE

Theyre walking through shrubbery and hedges that lead them
to a pair of empty deck chairs by the jacuzzi end of the
pool One of the Twins is still in the jacuzzi

JILL
-- so when are you going to Egypt

Jill stops cold She turns to Pope

JILL

JILL
(laughing)
Johnny
(she hugs him)
Why didnt you tell me before

POPE
-- just before I ask you out I
cant do that Lets get out of
here before good old Les catches up
with us again

Theres a flash of light from the poolhouse window Jill
turns toward it then back to Pope still making up her mind
ANGLE SHIFTS SLIGHTLY to HOLD on light from window

INT POOLHOUSE - GEORGE AND JACKIE

George has pulled a pair of cokes out of the fridge Hes
looking at Jackie closes the refrigerator lamely It opens
again and he closes it again

JACKIE
Whats wrong

GEORGE
-- do you want ice

Interior poolhouse lit now by lights from outside

JACKIE
-- no

George pops the tops of the cans hands one to Jackie
Neither one of them drink Theyre staring steadily at each
other their eyes shining from reflections from the tennis
court lights which someone has turned on

GEORGE
(finally)
-- were kidding ourselves

JACKIE
(staring right back
-- we are

GEORGE
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty
years old and Mary told me I was
supposed to meet Jill at the shop
It seared me shitless

JACKIE
Why

GEORGE
I cant imagine being with Jill
when shes fifty years old I cant
imagine not being with you

George moves to her Jackie is waiting for him They kiss It
is long and lingering and deliberate George breaks away and
goes to the poolhouse door Theres no lock only an eye
latch on the screen door He latches it tests it It gives
slightly Nevertheless he shuts the door and heads back to
Jackie who stands waiting

JACKIE
-- but what about her I dont want
to hurt Jill
George takes the coke out of her hand She lets him

LESTER

walks back in the foyer holding a drink swaying The strobe
ights are going again in the living room

Suddenly he sees a girl at least half nude her huge painted
avender tits flashing at him through the strobe lights The
vision disturbs him greatly

He carefully steps down into the room in an effort to get
near her She seems to move He moves after her through the
ights down the length of the room going as quickly as
prudence allows Finally when they reach the end of the

iving room shes disappeared Then he looks out and sees her
poised at the top of the steps a few yards away by the hedged
path that leads down to the pool

He lunges toward the vision and bounces off a sliding glass
door

JILL AND JOHNNY POPE

have made it through the entrance and Popes Porsche is in
sight Jill suddenly stops and looks at Pope

POPE
Whats wrong

JILL
We cant really leave that poor man
here alone

POPE
-- hell never know the difference

Jill is clearly thinking about something else besides Lester

JILL
-- still -- at least we should tell
him were going Cmon

POPE
(going along with it
protesting)
Im telling you he wont know the
difference

BY THE POOL - LESTER

now with a sizable bump on his head he moves with the care
that only tightrope walkers and drunks can move every step
is a possible disaster

TWIN
(from Jacuzzi)
Hey

Lester looks down sees one of the Twins Her arm is
outstretched her breasts dripping water VISIBLE through the
shrubbery spotlights Shes holding a joint

TWIN (CONTD)
-- its getting soggy

Lester takes it

THE GUY WITH HER
-- just put it on the bench over
there and come on in

LESTER
-- in there

THE GUY
Sure

Lester takes the joint and with fierce concentration makes it
over to the bench He puts the joint down

Stares at it He looks up and theres the other Twin standing
beside him nude with her breasts visible through the towel
loosely flung over her shoulders

TWIN
(meaning joint)
Could I have that

Lester silently hands it to her Stares at the pool and the
other Twin isnt there He looks back and the one who had
taken the joint is gone He looks back to the pool and the
other Twin surfaces with the force of Flipper beside the Guy
in the pool

Lester stares then he sighs and pulls off his pants almost
falling down as he does

Carrying them he walks over to the edge of the jacuzzi

LESTER
Say --

THE GUY
-- what is it now man

LESTER
Do you know where I can find a
towel

THE GUY

-- the poolhouse
Holding his trousers his tux shirt hanging half down over
his boxer shorts Lester moves on over to the poolhouse He
tries the door The latch creaks He pulls at it again and
the latch pops open He starts to open the door then hears
the unmistakable sounds of a couple in the throes of intense
love making The girl is quite carried away

Lester hesitates He listens as her sighs interspersed with
fetching little sobs begin to mount in intensity He thinks
better of it He takes his hand off the door knob and quietly
closes the screen door

He starts to walk away then notices the window on the side
He cant resist He moves to it He cant see anything He
moves closer The dim dark but classical outline of a man
mounted on a woman moving with ease but increasing intensity
can be SEEN Lester watches The SOUNDS are not as loud from
this angle but gradually they can be HEARD as the womans
cries grow louder Lester is glued to the window

JILLS VOICE
-- there you are Les Les -- Les --
Les were leaving

The ANGLE has BROADENED to SHOW Lester holding his pants not
taking his face away from the window Jill and Johnny Pope
stand beside him

LESTER
Shhh --
(with genuine awe)
-- now thats what I call fucking

Pope almost inadvertently tries to look in the window

As he does a light begins to flood the room It is the
refrigerator door slowly opening due in part to the rhythmic
impact of the lovers transmitted through the sofa to an end
table to another end table and to the refrigerator

It opens until the light shines on the upper body and face of
George and Jackie

LESTER

who has been smiling continues to smile until the enormity of
the image hits him His face freezes It is harsh and
determined He turns slowly away from the window and walks
past Jill without looking at her

JILL
-- what --

She turns to the window and sees George and Jackie herself

JILL (CONTD)
(watching)
Oh my God Oh no oh no Oh no

She turns and picks up a wrought iron end table and hurls it
through the window shattering the glass everywhere

JILL (CONTD)
(screaming)
You son of a bitch You bastard

WITH GEORGE AND JACKIE
George has leapt up

GEORGE
Honey Whereve you been Weve
been looking everywhere for you

Jackie doesnt move only stares wide-eyed through the broken
window at the screaming Jill

JACKIE
(softly)
Oh God

An ashtray is hurled into the room smashing against the
wall and Jill can be SEEN now storming off with Pope

George with one leg in his pants rushes over to a far
window pulls it open

GEORGE
Jill Jill Jill goddammit

Hes got the pants on backwards He turns back to Jackie who
has already slipped into her dress is stuffing pantyhose
into a purse

GEORGE (CONTD)
-- Jesus -—

JACKIE
-- well you better go after her

He bends down turns his pants around and is hopping into
them

GEORGE
-- shit
(he grabs his shirt)
wait here honey --

He runs out of the door beside the pool past the jacuzzi
and into the maze of hedgerows The Twins stand motionless
side by side in the water

TWIN ONE
George
(to Twin Two)
Who was that

TWIN TWO
Far out

George searching wildly through hedgerows is calling Jill
He cant find her He finds himself next to a ten foot ivy
covered wall He cant reach the top He moves along the
wall arrives at a wrought iron gate Its locked He peers
through the gate calling frantically

GEROGE
Jill honey

Inches from his face on the other side of the gate the bare
teeth of a huge German Sheperd GROWL at him viciously George
chooses to go up the hedgerows toward the living room of the
house

He trips and falls
INT LIVING ROOM

George running through the strobe-lit party to the foyer
Hes bare-footed but his pants are on His frilly shirt is
unbuttoned

INT FOYER - GEORGE
breathing heavily spots Red Dog

GEORGE
Hey Red Dog You seen Jill

RED DOG
She just went out the door man

George charges out the door in time to see the red Porsches
taillights blink bright at the end of the driveway before it
purrs off into the night

George turns and runs back into the house and through the
strobe-lighting living room

AT THE POOLHOUSE

George heaving deep breaths now runs on into the poolhouse
The refrigerator door still hangs open Window glass is
scattered on the floor and George steps on it cutting his

foot hopping a little pulling out a shard Jackies gone

He opens the poolhouse bathroom door

EXT HIGH ROAD - NIGHT

George on his motorbike COVERED by a few bars of Buffalo
Springfields For What Its Worth has thrown on a peacoat
but kept on his velvet trousers Hes riding up what should
now be a familiar road to Jills The lights from the city
below flash in and out of view

JILLS GARAGE - GEORGE

pulls in Her slot in the three car garage is empty only the
oil slick stares at him

Theres the SOUND of a CAR coming down the road He looks up
expectantly As it comes by the morning newspaper is tossed
at his feet

George turns and fishes in the hanging planter by the door
He pulls out a key blows the dirt off it and goes inside
INT JILLS - GEORGE - NIGHT

OPERATORS VOICE

GEORGE
Okay thanks

He hangs up Stares around the room Jills apartment is as
usual good-little-girl tidy (A contrast with Jackies
particularly kitchen)

George walks over to the window and looks at the city He
walks out onto the deck and sits in a deck chair

DISSOLVE TO
GRAY SCREEN
There is the SOUND of a CAR IDLING

George opens his eyes Above him is the carport and Jills
yellow Mustang has just pulled in George rises He walks
into the living room as Jill comes down the steps to the

kitchen carrying the paper The kitchen clock reads 444

George glances at it Then back at Jill She looks at him
frightened but not moving Her hair is stringy and shes got
no makeup on Theres a bruise on the inside of her upper arm
and a small one on her neck and one on her left thigh all of
which George will note in the course of the scene

George looks her up and down

JILL
I dont want to fight George
GEORGE

Look uh -- I love you

JILL
Bullshit

GEORGE
(moving to her taking her
arm)

EXT GEORGES HOUSE

George shuffles up the steps to his front porch and into the
living room

INT GEORGES LIVING ROOM

George finds himself facing Lester and two other MEN who look
like hoods Lester sits in the chair George sat in the other
night Before him is a bottle of J and B a paper bucket filled
with melting ice The other men rise when George walks into
the room

Lester glass in hand stares silently at George

LESTER
(to the other two)
Wait outside would you

The two Men walk toward George and pass him on either side
coming very close Both of them are much bigger than George
They stare through George as they pass him

George continues to stand there Lester drinking continues
to stare Lester glances idly around the living room Then
back to George

LESTER (CONTD)

LESTER

EXT STREET - GEORGE - DAY

on his cycle drives up Bowmont into Jackies driveway Her
car is there

George jumps off his bike fairly races to the door Its
open and he barges in Hes met by Jackies Yorkies who bark
furiously jumping up and down nipping his pantlegs for
attention

JACKIES VOICE
-- just a minute youre early --

Jackie comes walking out Shes carrying a large cooking
spoon and wears an apron over a travelling outfit a
pantsuit Shes wearing more makeup than usual She stops
when she sees George

GEORGE
-- good afternoon --

George is not prepared for this

GEORGE

JACKIE
-- yes honey youve got to get
out of here

GEORGE

JACKIE
Lesters on his way

George stares at her then walks past her into the living
room Bags are packed a coat thrown over them The wire
kennel carrying cages for the Yorkies are beside the bags

George looks into the kitchen where Jackies been cooking
some pasta

GEORGE
Where are you going

JACKIE

(exasperated but not
unkind)

talk now Where are you going

JACKIE

Look -- either you leave or I leave
because I dont want the two of us

The level of her nervousness has just risen about fifty
decibels Theres the SOUND of a CAR outside

JACKIE (CONTD)
My God thats him --

George looks out the window

GEORGE
-- Its Malones

JACKIE
Thats it then Im leaving
With that she tosses the spoon onto an end table and rushes
out the door George starts after her The DRY CLEANER comes
to the door stopping George

CLEANER
Cleaners

George has to fumble with Jackies cleaning and keep the dogs
contained He does tosses the cleaning down and races
outside to his bike

ON THE STREET

he sees Jackies car rounding the corner going up the hill
winding around the curves George guns his bike and takes off
after her

AROUND WINDING CURVES - GEORGE

almost sideswipes a car parked on a hairpin turn Jackies on
the curve above him

AT THE NEXT CURVE - GEORGE
catches up with her pulls even to her

GEORGE
Pull over pull over

He threatens to run her into the curb She stops the car
sharply and jumps out

AT THE TOP OF THE DRIVE

Theyve reached a cul de sac where theres a parched view
lot not built on

Yellow October weeds cover it and theres a huge television
antenna in its center which sways slightly in an afternoon
wind

Jackie has run onto the lot then slows to a walk She grabs
one of the rusty stays of the swaying antennas stares down
below her

Her house can be seen from this angle the Malones truck
just pulling away

George comes up to her

JACKIE
(looking below her)
Youre going to kill me

GEORGE
No --
JACKIE
(turning to him
imploring)
Well then what are you trying to do-

GEORGE
I want to marry you I want to take
care of you and I want your
children and I want you to be my
girl Thats all I want Thats all
I want out of my life and its a
lot

She stares at him in disbelief She actually clutches her

stomach

GEORGE (CONTD)
Look I dont know if Ill ever
make it I mean Im a fuckup but
Ill take care of you Ill make
you happy I swear to God I will

Jackie doesnt answer She slowly sinks to the ground

sinks beside her Her eyes are wet

GEORGE (CONTD)
Jackie Jackie answer me for
Gods sake answer me

JACKIE
If you knew how many times I wanted
to hear you say that

GEORGE
So Im saying it

JACKIE

GEORGE

GEORGE

JACKIE

GEORGE

George

JACKIE
What

George now is very near tears himself What he says now he
has to force out of himself as if its the biggest secret he
holds

GEORGE
I dont trust anyone but
you

George lets his head fall on her shoulder Shes kneeling
supported by the television aerial and George cries quietly
on her shoulder She has her arm around him

JACKIE
Oh my baby

As shes holding George and looking down the hill Lesters
silver Rolls pulls up Lester gets out of the car goes to
the front door

JACKIE (CONTD)
God theres Lester

GEORGE

JACKIE
I cant just let him stand by the
door

GEORGE

Dont leave me

JACKIE

where I am

GEORGE
What for
JACKIE
I dont know -- Ive got to

She gets up and hurries over to her car starts it and goes
back down the hill George sits under the television aerial
and watches her car go down the hill periodically flashing
INTO VIEW

Finally she pulls up while Lester is pacing back and forth
She hurries to him He taxes her by the shoulders They talk
for a moment The discussion looks like Jackie is giving
Lester directions She glances uneasily up toward George
George is watching them
He sees that Lester and Jackie have their backs to him his
arm around her shoulder hers around his waist Theyre going

through the front door

THE END
