1 INT DARK CHAMBER -- NIGHT
Foreboding organ music is heard
We are looking down at a rough brick floor is it an
alley a cobblestone street a warehouse a factory

were not sure
The flickering glow of flame is the only illumination
The ominous organ music continues as

From the bottom of the frame
A dark pool of blood slowly begins to spread moving up
the frame defying gravity the flickering flame reflected
in the blood

Finally the pool of blood fills the entire frame
SUDDENLY --
A shrill factory whistle blows--

ENORMOUSLY LOUD -- blood-chilling and spine-shattering --
the whistle is a bizarre combination of sound a factory

whistle a hog being slaughtered a dog snarling a roaring
inferno a human scream--

And a mans face appears upside down reflected in the pool
of blood

He is THE GENTLEMAN a slender dandy in pearl grey gloves and
matching waistcoat A cold and superior aristocrat

The camera slowly revolves -- the Gentleman becoming right
side up as--

GENTLEMAN
Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd
His skin was pale and his eye was odd
He shaved the faces of gentlemen
Who never thereafter were heard of again
He trod a path that few have trod
Did Sweeney Todd
The Demon Barber of Fleet Street

We cut from the blood to see the Gentleman standing before
us Strangely impassive

We are in an eerie dark chamber unclear a low ceiling a
world of silhouettes and shadows

PAGE 2
1 1

Another figure emerges from the miasma of shadows into the
hellish flickering of flame THE BANKER He is large rotund
and sleek Impressive muttonchops

BANKER
He kept a shop in London town
Of fancy clients and good renown
And what if none of their souls were saved
They went to their maker impeccably shaved

More FIGURES begin to emerge from the shadows joining the
Gentleman and the Banker as

BANKER
By Sweeney
By Sweeney Todd
The Demon Barber of Fleet Street

Although prosaic in appearance these figures are in fact
GHOSTS

GHOSTS
Swing your razor wide Sweeney
Hold it to the skies
Freely flows the blood of those
Who moralize

As they continue the new figures become more distinct

THE GENERAL a tough leather-skinned military man ina
crimson imperial uniform

GENERAL
His needs were few his room was bare

THE PRIEST a lean severe man with pale skin in clerical
attire

PRIEST
A lavabo and a fancy chair

THE TOURIST a small meek man with glasses in an ill-fitting
suit

TOURIST
A mug of suds and a leather strop
An apron a towel a pail anda mop

THE STUDENT a dashing young man from Oxford with luxurious
long hair

PAGE 1
STUDENT
For neatness he deserves a nod
Does Sweeney Todd

GENTLEMAN
The Demon Barber of Fleet Street

The ghosts are a bit more insinuating now as they move around
this mysterious world

GHOSTS

(variously)
Inconspicuous Sweeney was
Quick and quiet and clean ‘e was
Back of his smile under his word
Sweeney heard music that nobody heard
Sweeney pondered and Sweeney planned
Like a perfect machine e planned
Sweeney was smooth Sweeney was subtle
Sweeney would blink and rats would scuttle

The specters are becoming more insistent their strange
impassivity giving way to accusation as the flickering red
flame becomes an inferno--

GHOSTS
(variously)

Sweeney was smooth Sweeney was subtle

Sweeney would blink and rats would scuttle

Inconspicuous Sweeney was

Quick and quiet and clean e was

Like a perfect machine e was

Was Sweeney

Sweeney

Sweeney

Sweeeeeneeeceey
On this explosive note we revolve -- away from the ghostly
Furies--

To discover--

SWEENEY TODD Standing before us An unclear figure
silhouetted in blazing red flames

We slowly push in on him as

GHOSTS
Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd
He served a dark and a vengeful god
What happened then--

PAGE 4
1 GENTLEMAN
Well whos to say

BANKER
And he wouldnt want us to give it away

GHOSTS
(variously)
Not Sweeney
Not Sweeney Todd
The Demon Barber of Fleet Street

On this note we push in tight on the figure of Todd

Music and the clanging of a clock tower bell are heard as we
slowly begin pulling back and are imperceptibly transported
to

2 EXT SHIP -- THAMES -- ALMOST DAWN

ANTHONY a young sailor of about 20 is standing at the rail
of a ship We see the obscure shape of rigging and sails
behind him The cries of sailors echo

Behind him stand the GENTLEMAN and the BANKER They are
looking past Anthony looking at something They move away as
Anthony peers through the fog straining to see

London

Gradually as the ship approaches the towering spires and
mountainous rooftops of the city begin to stand out in
relief to emerge through the fog like a tiger creeping
toward its prey

Music continues as Anthony takes in the dreadful and
magnificent spectacle of the 19th Century metropolis The
gnarl of rooftops The labyrinth of streets and alleys The
black trails of smoke reaching up like skeletal fingers from
a thousand chimneys

London Sulfurous London

Anthony is awestruck

ANTHONY
I have sailed the world beheld its wonders
From the Dardanelles

To the mountains of Peru

But theres no place like London--

Then--

PAGE
2

Sweeney Todd steps to Anthonys side grimly interrupting--

TODD
No theres no place like London

ANTHONY
Mr Todd

TODD
You are young
Life has been kind to you
You will learn

Todds glares forward his haunted gaze never leaving the
approaching city

EXT DOCKS -- DAWN 3

Music continues as Todd stands very still and takes in the
shadowy figures on the docks

Anthony seems almost lost at his side overwhelmed by the
scale and aura of the city

ANTHONY
Lord takes your breath away
doesnt it

Todd shudders violently almost snarling

TODD
Theres a hole in the world
Like a great black pit
And the vermin of the world
Inhabit it
And its morals arent worth
What a pig could spit
And it goes by the name Of London
At the top of the hole

Sit the privileged few

Making mock of the vermin

In the lower zoo

Turning beauty into filth and greed
I too

Have sailed the world and seen its wonders
For the cruelty of men

Is as wondrous as Peru

But theres no place like London

Anthony looks at his friend mystified by his grim reaction
to the city

PAGE 6

TODD
I beg your indulgence Anthony My
mind is far from easy In these once
familiar streets I feel shadows

everywhere
ANTHONY
Shadows
TODD
Ghosts

Anthony looking at him questioning Todd continues quietly

TODD

There was a barber and his wife
And she was beautiful
A foolish barber and his wife
She was his reason and his life
And she was beautiful
And she was virtuous
And he was

(a breath)
Naive

Anthony watches rapt as Todd remembers
4 EXT FLOWER MARKET -- FLASHBACK -- DAY 4
Fifteen years before

Todd walks with his beautiful wife LUCY through a crowded
flower market a colorful explosion of blossoms Lucy carries
their one-year-old baby JOHANNA

Todd is almost unrecognizable to us content and smiling
Chatting with his wife Happy

TODD (V0O)
There was another man who saw
That she was beautiful
A pious vulture of the law
Who with a gesture of his claw
Removed the barber from his plate
Then there was nothing but to wait
And she would fall
So soft
So young
So lost
And oh so beautiful

PAGE 7

During the above JUDGE TURPIN an elderly man with a
saturnine demeanor eyes Lucy through the luxurious bunches
of flowers He stalks her desiring her

With the Judge is his nefarious creature BEADLE BAMFORD The
Beadle is a large man his florid nature and pink powdered
face never quite disguising his lethality

The Judge whispers to the Beadle indicating Todd Then the
Beadle and several policemen sweep in and drag Todd off The
Judge moves in on Lucy like a predator

And we return to
EXT DOCKS -- DAWN 5
Music continues

ANTHONY
And the lady sir did she succumb

TODD
Oh that was many years ago
I doubt if anyone would know
A quiet beat

TODD
I owe you my life Anthony If you
hadnt spotted me I would be lost on
the ocean still Thank you

Todd picks up his duffel bag preparing to go

ANTHONY
Will I see you again

TODD
You might find me if you like around
Fleet Street

ANTHONY
Until then my friend

He offers his hand Todd takes it and shakes
Then Todd quickly turns and goes

Anthony stands for a moment saddened by the mysterious pall
that hangs over his friend

PAGE 8

6 EXT STREET -- MORNING

Todd strides along deep in thought The emotions roiling
within him finally seethe out in a dark mutter

TODD
Theres a hole in the world
Like a great black pit
And its filled with people
Who are filled with shit
And the vermin of the world
Inhabit it

He disappears down the street as the music THUNDERS--
7 EXT LONDON ASSAULT -- DAY

--We ZOOM ahead of Todd -- cutting through the city at
lightning pace down twisting alleys and up crowded boulevards
-- into tunnels and over bridges -- slashing through London
at breakneck speed -- the insane explosion of music sending
us hurtling to--
8 EXT THE PIE SHOP -- DAY
Fleet Street
We see the exterior of Mrs Lovetts pie shop It is tatty
and unloved by all Yet it has a strange ghostly presence to

it Imposing and dead at the same time

There is an exterior staircase leading up to a darkened
second floor room with a window overlooking the street

The music slows and continues as we see Todd standing in
front of the shop considering it deeply
The GENERAL we saw before passes glancing at Todd Here and
then gone
Todd finally strides to the shop and enters

9 INT PIE SHOP -- DAY

Behind the dusty counter is

MRS LOVETT a venal vigorous and slatternly woman in her
40s

She is currently busy chopping a loathsome mess of suet with
a wicked looking knife her greasy hair hanging down over her
face

PAGE 9

The moment Todd enters -- and the bell at the door sounds --
her head snaps up and her eyes are on him like a bird of
prey

MRS LOVETT
A customer

Todd is startled starts to go--

MRS LOVETT
Wait Whats yer rush
Whats yer hurry
(She sticks the knife into
the counter)
You gave me such a--
(Wipes her hands on her
apron) )

Fright I thought you was a ghost
Half a minute cantcher

Sit
Sit ye down
(An order)
Sit
(He obeys)

All I meant

is that I

Havent seen a customer for weeks
Did you come here for a pie sir
(Todd nods She flicks a
bit of dust off a pie
with a rag)
Do forgive me if me heads a little vague--

Ugh

(She plucks something off

the pie examines it)

What is that
But youd think we had the plague--
(She drops it on the floor

and stamps on it)

From the way that people--
(She flicks something off

the pie with her finger)

Keep avoiding--
(Spotting it moving)

No you don

t

(She smacks it with her

hand)

Heaven knows I try sir

(Lifts
it)
Tsk

her hand looks at

(She wipes it on the edge
of the counter)

But theres

no one comes in even to inhale--

the last dust

off the pie as she brings

Tsk
(She blows
it to him)
Right you are
(Todd nods)

sir Would you like a drop of ale

Mind you I cant hardly blame them--

(Pouring a

tankard of ale)

These are probably the worst pies in London
I know why nobody cares to take them--

PAGE

should know

make them

But good No

The worst pies in London--

Even thats polite

The worst pies in London--

£ you doubt it take a bite
(He does Its horrible)

s that just disgusting

You have to concede it

ts nothing but crusting--

Here drink this youll need it--
(She gives him the ale)

he worst pies in London

During the following she slams lumps of dough on the counter
and rolls them out grunting frequently as she goes

MRS LOVETT
And no wonder with the price of meat
What it is--
(Grunt)
When you get it
(Grunt)
Never
(Grunt)
Thought Id live to see the day
Mend think it was a treat
Finding poor
(Grunt)
Animals
(Grunt)
Wot are dying in the street
Mrs Mooney has a pie shop
Does a business but I noticed something weird--
Lately all her neighbors cats have disappeared
(Shrugs)
Have to hand it to her--
Wot I calls
Enterprise
Popping pussies into pies
Wouldnt do in my shop--
Just the thought of its enough to make you sick

PAGE 11
9 And Im telling you them pussy cats is quick
(Leans on counter
exhausted)

No denying times is hard sir -- Even harder than

The worst pies in London
Only lard and nothing more--
(As Todd gamely tries

another mouthful)

Is that just revolting

All greasy and gritty

It looks like its molting

And tastes like--

Well pity

A woman alone

With limited wind

And the worst pies in London
(Sighs heavily)

Ah sir

Times is hard Times is hard

She finishes one of the crusts with a flourish

ends

Todd meanwhile is gulping at his ale trying
Mrs Lovetts hideous creation

MRS LOVETT
Trust me dearie its going to take

more than ale to wash that taste out
Come with me and well get you a nice

tumbler of gin

as the music

to wash down

She leads him through the curtains at the back of the pie
shop and into

INT PARLOR -- DAY
Her parlor is a wonder of seedy faux-middle class
Victoriana Little knickknacks dusty plants and dingy
There is a threadbare mauve sofa in front of a
comfortable fire

doilies

A faded picture postcard of the seaside hangs on a wall

She goes to a sideboard and pours him a huge glass of gin as

MRS LOVETT
Isnt this homey now Me cheery
wallpaper was a real bargain too it
being only partly singed when the
chapel burnt down

PAGE 12

She hands him the gin He gulps it down washing the taste of

her pie out of his mouth

MRS LOVETT
Theres a good boy now you sit down
and warm your bones you look chilled
through

He sits before the fire

TODD
Isnt that a room over the shop If
times are so hard why dont you rent
it out

She glances up at the roof considering the room over them

MRS LOVETT
Up there Oh no one will go near
it

She turns to him something a little intense and probing
about her gaze

MRS LOVETT
People think its haunted

TODD
Haunted

She holds his gaze

MRS LOVETT
And whos to say theyre wrong
You see years ago something happened
up there Something not very nice
The flickering flame from the fire begins to cast a more
intense red glow on her face

MRS LOVETT
There was a barber and his wife
And he was beautiful
A proper artist with a knife
But they transported him for life
(Sighs)
And he was beautiful

The music continues as she looks at him again with that

rather intense gaze

PAGE 13

MRS LOVETT
Barker his name was -- Benjamin
Barker

TODD
Transported What was his crime

MRS LOVETT
(with an edge)
Foolishness

She turns again to the fire the red glow bathing her face as

she remembers

INT BARBER SHOP -- FLASHBACK -- DAY

Lucy is pacing holding Baby Johanna to her closely Lucy is

distraught strained tears in her eyes

As Lucy paces we notice the room is full of dead and dying
flowers dozens of dried bouquets tossed aside and ignored

MRS LOVETT (VO)
He had this wife you see
Pretty little thing
Silly little nit

Had her chance for the moon on a string--

Poor thing Poor thing

Lucy moves to the window looks out She sees Judge Turpin
and the Beadle waiting below The Judge holds yet another

bouquet

MRS LOVETT (VO)
There was this Judge you see
Wanted her like mad
Every day hed send her a flower
But did she come down from her tower
Sat up there and sobbed by the hour
Poor fool

Lucy moves away from the window sobbing
MRS LOVETT (VO)
Ah but there was worse yet to come
Poor thing

PAGE 14

EXT EXCLUSIVE STREET -- FLASHBACK -- EVENING 12

The Beadle is leading a nervous Lucy along an exclusive
street of dark stone mansions grand but somehow menacing
Lucy is wearing her best dress

MRS LOVETT (VO)
The Beadle calls on her all polite
Poor thing poor thing
The Judge he tells her is all contrite
He blames himself for her dreadful plight
She must come straight to his house tonight
Poor thing poor thing

INT TURPINS MANSION -- BALLROOM -- FLASHBACK -- NIGHT 13

The Beadle ushers Lucy into a ballroom She is shocked to see
a fancy-dress ball in progress

Masked couples swirl around the ballroom their number
sinisterly multiplied by the distorting mirrors that frame
the room The hanging chandeliers draped in red cloth cast
a disquieting incarnadine glow on the proceedings

MRS LOVETT (VO)
Of course when she goes there
Poor thing poor thing
Theyre having this ball all in masks

Lucy wanders lost through the swirling dancers they buffet
her confusing her

MRS LOVETT (VO)
Theres no one she knows there
Poor dear poor thing
She wanders tormented and drinks
Poor thing
The Judge has repented she thinks
Poor thing
Oh where is Judge Turpin she asks

The Beadle finds Lucy again and graciously gives her his arm
leading her through the party She is thankful for the
salvation he provides He brings her to Judge Turpin

The Judge descends on Lucy raping her The other guests
crowd around ravenously enjoying the spectacle A feverish
nightmare

MRS LOVETT (VO)
He was there all right--
Only not so contrite
She wasnt no match for such craft you see

PAGE 15

13

And everyone thought it so droll

They figured she had to be daft you see

So all of ‘em stood there and laughed you see
Poor soul

Poor thing

TODD (VO)
NOOOOOOOO

Todds wild howl shatters the memory and tears us back to--
INT PARLOR -- DAY 14
--Todd is bolting up from the sofa tormented--

TODD
see NooOoOoOoO

He stands for a terrible beat

TODD
Would no one have mercy on her

MRS LOVETT
So it is you -- Benjamin Barker

TODD
Wheres Lucy Wheres my wife

MRS LOVETT
She poisoned herself Arsenic from the
apothecary on the corner I tried to
stop her but she wouldnt listen to
me And hes got your daughter

TODD
PAGE

He Judge Turpin

MRS LOVETT
Adopted her like his own

Todd absorbs this sickening news

TODD
Fifteen years of sweating in a living
hell on a false charge Fifteen years
dreaming that I might come home to
find a loving wife and child

A beat as he stares into the fire madness and purpose
creeping in

14

MRS LOVETT
Well I cant say the years have been
particularly kind to you Mr Barker
but you still--

TODD
No not Barker That man is dead Its
Todd now Sweeney Todd And he will

have his revenge

He continues with a chilling and quiet resolve as he stares
with unblinking eyes into the fire

TODD
Judge Turpin and the Beadle will pay
for what they did

A beat He finally turns to her

TODD
First I must have my shop back

EXT PIE SHOP -- DAY 15

They emerge from the pie shop She begins to scale the
exterior staircase to the darkened second floor room He
hesitates

MRS LOVETT

PAGE

Come along
She continues up he slowly follows
INT BARBER SHOP -- DAY 16

A macabre shroud of dust and spiders webs Furniture covered
in sheets A broken mirror on one wall

We hear footsteps approaching and then Mrs Lovett enters
The door creaks like a living thing

MRS LOVETT
Not to worry a touch of oil will put
that right
(she turns back to Todd)
Nothing to be afraid of love
come in

She moves into the room But Todd hesitates at the door
looking into the room

For him this is a truly haunted place

16

Meanwhile she kneels and pries loose a floorboard

Underneath there is a hidden area Within that something
covered with a velvet cloth She removes it and carefully
unwraps it Her touch is particularly gentle and respectful

We discover it is a fine leather case She looks at it fora
beat Then turns to him dusting it off

TODD
I dont believe it

He finally steps into the room drawn toward the case

MRS LOVETT
When they came for the girl I hid
em I thought who knows Maybe the
silly blighterll be back again
Cracked in the head wasnt I

Haunting music begins as she opens the case

And we see it contains a beautiful set of razors

He stands for a long moment gazing down at his beloved

razors

MRS LOVETT
Those handles is chased silver aint
they

TODD
Silver yes

These are my friends

See how they glisten

(He picks up a small
razor)

See this one shine

How he smiles in the light

My friend my faithful friend
(Holding it to his ear
feeling the edge with his
thumb) )

Speak to me friend

Whisper Ill listen
(Listening)

I know I know--

Youve been locked out of sight

All these years--

Like me my friend

Well Ive come home

To find you waiting

PAGE 16

Home

And were together
And well do wonders
Wont we

Mrs Lovett leans over him in her own kind of trance as
well They now sing simultaneously

TODD
(Picking out a larger
razor)

You there my friend
Come let me hold you

Now with a sigh
PAGE 19

The music
razors

You grow warm
In my hand
My friend
My clever friend
(Putting it back)
Rest now my friends
Soon Ill unfold you
Soon youll know splendors

You never have dreamed
All your days--

MRS LOVETT

£ you only knew Mr Todd--
Ooh Mr Todd
Youre warm
n my hand
Youve come home
Always had a fondness for you

TODD
--My lucky friends
Till now your shine
Was merely silver
Friends
You shall drip rubies
Youll soon drip precious
Rubies

MRS LOVETT
Never you fear Mr Todd
You can move in here Mr Todd
Splendors you never have dreamed
All your days
Will be yours
Im your friend

And youre mine
Dont they shine beautiful
Silvers good enough for me
Mr T

continues quietly as Todd stares at one

TODD

of his

PAGE

Leave me now

She goes Todd finally picks up his biggest razor and slowly
opens it looks at it

TODD
At last my arm is complete again

And he remains standing Exalted
Then--
In the shattered mirror on the wall he suddenly sees--

The distorted reflections of the Gentleman the Banker and
the General looking at him--

GHOSTS
Lift your razor high Sweeney
Hear it singing Yes
Sink it in the rosy skin
Of righteousness

Todd turns to them

GHOSTS
(variously)
His voice was soft his manner mild
He seldom laughed but he often smiled
Hed seen how civilized men behave
He never forgot and he never forgave
Not Sweeney
Not Sweeney Todd
The Demon Barber of Fleet Street

Todd pulls a sheet off Baby Johannas cradle A cloud of dust
rises

The ghosts disappear in the cloud of dust and Todd stands
alone staring at the cradle holding his razor

EXT EXCLUSIVE STREET -- DAY
Anthony now out of his sailors uniform is walking along
the sidewalk near the Judges mansion absorbed in a copy of

Baedekers London

He stops lost trying to get his bearings studying his map

Then an unusual sound emerges through the normal cosmopolitan
bustle It is the sound of a woman humming He looks up to
see

JOHANNA a 16-year-old girl with golden hair beautiful and
hauntingly sad She sits at her window above behind bars
humming to herself as she does needlepoint

Anthony watches her absolutely mesmerized

Johanna notices a Bird Seller passing He carries a long
wooden pole with little bird cages attached

JOHANNA
Green finch and linnet bird
Nightingale blackbird
How is it you sing
How can you jubilate
Sitting in cages
Never taking wing
Outside the sky waits
Beckoning beckoning
Just beyond the bars
How can you remain
Staring at the rain
Maddened by the stars
How is it you sing
Anything
How is it you sing

Then she sees Anthony on the sidewalk below

Music continues There is a long look between them Her
intense melancholy expression moves him

She continues singing the strange anguish and yearning of
her words seem intended only for him

JOHANNA
My cage has many rooms
Damask and dark
Nothing there sings
Not even my lark
Larks never will you know
When theyre captive

PAGE 21

fq

Teach me to be more adaptive

Green finch and linnet bird
Nightingale blackbird
Teach me how to sing

£ I cannot fly

Let me sing

Then she turns away quickly alarmed when someone enters her
room She looks terrified

Below Anthony is concerned for her He sees her move from
the window

He is craning to see better when a BEGGAR WOMAN -- a filthy
tendril of a woman her foul clothes of rags like a second
skin -- suddenly thrusts her arm up from the curb imploring

BEGGAR WOMAN
Alms Alms
For a miserable woman
On a miserable chilly morning
(Anthony drops a coin into
her hand)
Thank yer sir thank yer

ANTHONY
Maam could tell me whose house this
is

BEGGAR WOMAN
Thats the great Judge Turpins house
that is

ANTHONY
And the young lady who resides there
BEGGAR WOMAN
Thats Johanna his pretty little
ward Keeps her snug he does all

locked up So dont you go
trespassing there or its a good
whipping for you -- or any other young

man with mischief on his mind
She suddenly leers into a lewd and demented assault

BEGGAR WOMAN
Ow would you like a little muff dear
A little jig jig
A little bounce around the bush
Wouldnt you like to push me parsley

PAGE 22

It looks to me dear
Like you got plenty there to push

She grabs at Anthonys crotch -- Anthony starts back -- she
turns away instantly plaintive again and appeals to other
pedestrians as she goes

BEGGAR WOMAN
Alms Alms
For a desperate woman

Anthony considers the mansion He sees a figure standing at a
window unclear behind the shutters watching him

He sits on a bench outside the mansion and sings quietly

ANTHONY
I feel you
Johanna
I feel you
I was half convinced Id waken
Satisfied enough to dream you
Happily I was mistaken Johanna
Ill steal you
Johanna
Ill steal you

Then the figure disappears from the window above Anthony
stands waits Then the doors to the mansion swing open

Anthony is expecting Johanna

But it is Judge Turpin the predator we met in Todds
flashback who steps into the doorway

He seems a different man now Paternal and warm he smiles
and beckons to Anthony

Anthony hesitates unsure The Judge beckons again Again the
warm smile

JUDGE
Come in lad Come in

Anthony goes into the mansion

18 INT TURPINS MANSION -- LIBRARY -- DAY
Judge Turpin leads Anthony into the dark library filled with

books Anthony is looking around for Johanna He is wary
this is all very strange

PAGE 23

JUDGE
you were looking for Hyde Park
you say
ANTHONY

Yes its terribly large on the map
but I keep getting lost

JUDGE
Sit down lad sit down

Anthony sits uncomfortable as the Judge pours two snifters

of brandy
ANTHONY
Its embarrassing for a sailor to lose
his bearings but well there you
are
Then

The large form of the Beadle appears from the shadows No
introduction is made Anthony glances to him uneasy

JUDGE
A sailor eh

ANTHONY
Yes sir The Bountiful out of
Plymouth
JUDGE
(handing him a snifter of
brandy)
A sailor must know the ways of the
world yes Must be practiced in
the ways of the world Would you

say you are practiced boy
ANTHONY
Sir

The Judge moves to consider some beautiful volumes bound in
the richest leather He runs a finger along the spines of the
books his large library of pornography

JUDGE
Oh yes such practices the
geishas of Japan the concubines of
Siam the catamites of Greece
the harlots of India I have them
all here Drawings of them

JUDGE (contd)
(he turns again to
Anthony)
All the vile things youve done
with your whores

Anthony is speechless The Judge just smiles at him amiably

JUDGE
Would you like to see

ANTHONY
(standing)
I think theres been some mistake--

JUDGE
Oh I think not You gandered at my
ward Johanna You gandered at her

Yes sir you gandered
The Beadle moves behind Anthony

ANTHONY
(glancing nervously back
at the Beadle)
I meant no harm--

JUDGE
Your meaning is immaterial Mark me
if I see your face again on this
street youll rue the day your bitch
of a mother gave you birth

PAGE

Anthony is stunned The Judge proceeds with shocking venom

JUDGE
My Johanna isnt one of your bloody
cock-chafers My Johanna is not to be
gandered at

He nods to the Beadle -- the Beadle instantly grabs Anthony
and brutally hauls him out

EXT MANSION -- ALLEY -- DAY
The Beadle drags Anthony through a rear door of the mansion
and flings him into a filthy alley
Anthony pulls himself up Stunned
BEADLE
Hyde Park is that way young sir A
right and then a left then straight
on you see
(MORE)
( )

BEADLE (contd)
(points)
Over there

Flustered Anthony turns to look--

The instant Anthonys back is turned the Beadle swings his
lethal billyclub and SLAMS him from behind brutally in the
kidneys -- Anthonys knees buckle--

The Beadle then SLAMS Anthony across the back of the neck --
Anthony falls hard--

The Beadle then uses one dainty foot to roll Anthony over--
Anthony gazes up at him panting for breath in agony--

BEADLE
You heard Judge Turpin little man

He presses the end of his billyclub into Anthonys forehead
grinding it hard--

BEADLE
Next time itll be your pretty brains
all over the pavement

PAGE

With that the Beadle returns to the mansion and slams the
door

Anthony slowly pulls himself to his knees doubled over
coughing up blood

A long beat as Anthony gets his breath wiping blood from his
face

Still doubled over he sings with burning intensity
ANTHONY
Ill steal you
Johanna
Ill steal you
Do they think that walls can hide you
Even now Im at your window
I am in the dark beside you
Buried sweetly in your yellow hair

He pulls himself up every movement is agony He makes his
way down the alley leaning on the wall for support

EXT EXCLUSIVE STREET -- DAY 20

The music swells as Anthony emerges from the dark alley into
the bright sunlight He makes his way along the sidewalk

20

ANTHONY
I feel you Johanna
And one day Ill steal you
Till Im with you then
Im with you there
Sweetly buried in your yellow hair

The soaring music continues as Anthony stops at a park across
the street from Turpins mansion bravely gazing up at
Johannas window

EXT STREET LEADING TO ST DUNSTANS MARKETPLACE -- DAY 21

Sweeney Todd and Mrs Lovett are moving quickly she
struggles to keep up with his long loping stride He carries
his razor case she carries a shopping basket

TODD

PAGE

Hes here every Thursday

MRS LOVETT
Like clockwork Eyetalian All the
rage he is

TODD
Not for long

EXT ST DUNSTANS MARKETPLACE DAY

They round a corner and move into the bustling marketplace A
steady mercantile hum as the cries of merchants and wandering
coster-mongers fill the air

Todd and Mrs Lovett move toward a hand-drawn caravan
dominating one corner of the marketplace It is painted like
a Sicilian donkey cart and on its side a sign declaims

Signor Adolfo Pirelli -- Haircutter to His Royal Majesty the
King of Naples

MRS LOVETT
Oh Mr T do you really think you can
do it

TODD
By tomorrow theyll all be flocking to

me like sheep to be shorn--

He stops abruptly when he sees--—

The Beadle casually strolling through the crowd Todd is
transfixed his ancient enemy so close

22

MRS LOVETT
(seeing the Beadle
pulling his arm)
Come along now dear he might
recognize you--

TODD
I will do what I have vowed to do
(he continues to glare at
the Beadle his voice
low)
Come closer my friend closer

Then TOBY -- a 13-year-old boy a bit small for his age
malnourished and consumptively pale -- emerges from Pirellis
caravan He bangs on a tin drum drawing customers

A crowd begins to gather at the caravan as

TOBY

Ladies and gentlemen
May I have your attention perlease
Do you wake every morning in shame and despair
To discover your pillow is covered with hair
Wot ought not to be there
Well ladies and gentlemen
From now on you can waken at ease
You need never again have a worry or care
I will show you a miracle marvelous rare
Gentlemen you are about to see something wot rose
from the dead

(A woman gasps he smiles

and wiggles a finger no)
On the top of my head

He dramatically doffs his cap revealing mountains of hair
which cascade to his shoulder

TOBY
Twas Pirellis
Miracle Elixir
Thats wot did the trick sir
True sir true
Was it quick sir
Did it in a tick sir
Just like an elixir
Ought to do
(To a Bald Man)
How about a bottle mister
Only costs a penny guaranteed
(Pours a drop on the bald
mans head)
Does Pirellis

PAGE 28 22

Stimulate the growth sir
You can have my oath sir
Tis unique

(Applies the bald mans
hand to the wet spot)
Rub a minute
Stimulatin in it
Soon youll have to thin it
Once a week

More customers are stepping up and buying bottles

Todd opens a bottle of the Elixir takes a whiff Disgusting
He smiles to Mrs Lovett his plan falling into place

TODD
(loudly to Mrs Lovett)
Pardon me maam whats that awful stench

MRS LOVETT
Are we standing near an open trench

TODD
(to a woman in the crowd)
Must be standing near an open trench

The crowd responds to Todd and Mrs Lovett looking askance

and sniffing at the bottles Toby nervously tries to distract
them

TOBY
Buy Pirellis Miracle Elixir
Anything wots slick sir
Soon sprouts curls
Try Pirellis
When they see how thick sir
You can have your pick sir
Of the girls

Want to buy a bottle missus

TODD
(sniffing bottle of
Elixir)
What is this

MRS LOVETT
(sniffing another
customers bottle)
What is this

TODD
Smells like piss

The music

Suddenly

PIRELLI
hair and MRS LOVETT
Smells like -- phew

TODD
This is piss Piss with ink

speeds up -- Toby is getting desperate

TOBY
Let Pirellis
Activate your roots sir--

TODD
Keep it off your boots sir--
Eats right through

TOBY
Yes get Pirellis
Use a bottle of it
Ladies seem to love it--

MRS LOVETT
Flies do too

PAGE

the curtains on the caravan are dramatically flung
wide to reveal--

a flamboyant Italian with a velvet suit

thick wavy

a dazzling smile Pirelli poses splendidly for a
moment Then

PIRELLI
I am Adolfo Pirelli

Da king of da barbers da barber of kings

E buon giorno good day
I blow you a kiss
(he does so)
And I da so-famous Pirelli
I wish-a to know-a
Who has-a da nerve-a to say
My elixir is piss
Who says this

TODD
I do
(Todd moves forward
boldly)
I am Mr Sweeney Todd of Fleet Street
I have opened a bottle of Pirellis
elixir and I say to you that it is
nothing but an arrant fraud concocted
from piss and ink

PAGE 30 22

The crowd gasps Pirelli is about to respond outraged but
Todd continues--

TODD
And furthermore -- signor -- I have
serviced no kings yet I wager I can
shave a cheek with ten times more

dexterity that any street mountebank

He snaps open his razor case and holds it up for the crowd to
see turning to display the wondrous razors

TODD
You see these razors

MRS LOVETT
(to the crowd)
The finest in England

TODD
(glaring at Pirelli)
I lay them against five pounds you are
no match for me You hear me sir
Either accept my challenge or reveal
yourself as a sham

MRS LOVETT
Bravo bravo

The crowd is enjoying this now whispering eagerly about the
bold challenge In the crowd we see a quick flash of the
meek TOURIST we saw earlier

Pirelli studies the razors for a moment and then turns to the
crowd with a confident smile
PIRELLI
You hear zis foolish man Watch and
see how he will regret his folly

Music begins as Todd moves into action preparing the
challenge

TODD
Friends whos for a free shave

Two men step forward A plain wooden chair is brought for
Todd as he moves into the boldest part of this plan

He carefully turns to The Beadle

TODD
Will Beadle Bamford be the judge

PAGE 22
Mrs Lovetts eyes shoot to Todd alarmed--
The Beadle moves toward Todd

Todd smiles amiably but quivers internally at being so
dreadfully close to his prey

Mrs Lovett watches concerned Will the Beadle recognize the
features of Benjamin Barker

Apparently not
The Beadle stops right before Todd and smiles

BEADLE
Glad as always to oblige my friends
and neighbors
(to the crowd)
Let the challenge commence

One man sits in Todds plain chair as the other moves to an
elaborate chair on Pirellis caravan Pirelli shakes out a
fancy bib with a flourish and covers his man Toby prepares
Pirellis ornate shaving supplies as Todd takes a plain towel
and tucks it around his mans neck

BEADLE
Ready

PIRELLI
Ready

TODD

Ready

BEADLE
The fastest smoothest shave is the
winner

He blows his shrill whistle Agitated music begins

Pirelli strops his razor quickly Todd in a leisurely manner
Pirelli keeps glancing at Todd in various paranoid ways
throughout frightened of Todds progress He starts whipping
up lather rapidly

PIRELLI
(while mixing furiously)
Now Signorini signori
We mix-a da lather
But first-a you gather
Around signorini signori
You looking a man

PAGE 22

Who have had-a da glory
To shave-a da Pope
Mr Sweeney-so-smart--
(Splatters the customer
with shaving cream)

Oh I beg-a you pardon -- 1ll
Call me a lie was-a only a cardinal--
Nope

It was-a da Pope

Unexpectedly Todd still shows no signs of starting to shave
his man He merely watches Pirellis performance Mrs Lovett
looks at him nervously wishing he would get on with it

Pirelli now feeling he can take his time sings lyrically as
he lathers and shaves with rhythmic scrapes and elaborate
gestures of wiping the razor

PIRELLI
To shave-a da face
To cut-a da hair
Require da grace
Require da flair
For if-a you slip
You nick da skin
You clip-a da chin
You rip-a da lip a bit
Beyond-a repair

Todd strops his razor slowly and deliberately -- shoop
shoop shoop -- disconcerting Pirelli and drawing the crowds
attention

PIRELLI
To shave-a da face
Or even a part
Widout it-a smart
Require da heart
Not just-a da flash
It take-a panache
It take-a da passion
For da art

Todd is unconcerned He just continues to slowly strop his
razor -- shoop shoop shoop -- which flusters Pirelli

PIRELLI
To shave-a da face
To trim-a da beard
To make-a da bristle
Clean like a whistle
Dis is from early infancy
Da talent give to me

( )
PAGE 22
By God
(Crosses himself with his
razor)
It take-a da skill
It take-a da brains
It take-a da will
To take-a da pains
It take-a da pace
It take-a da graaaaaace
While Pirelli holds this note elaborately Todd with a few
deft strokes quickly lathers his mans face shaves him and

signals the Beadle to examine him

BEADLE
(blowing whistle)
The winner is Todd

Pirelli deflates

MRS LOVETT
PAGE

(feeling the customers

cheek)
Smooth as a babys arse -- (to Todd) -
- Well done dear

The crowd laughs and applauds Todd as Pirelli goes to him

PIRELLI
(a profound bow)
Sir I bow to a skill far defter than
my own

TODD
The five pounds
Pirelli produces a distinctive chatelaine purse and removes a
five pound note gives it to Todd

PIRELLI
Here sir And may the good Lord smile
on you --
(a quick stab of a smile)
-- Until we meet again

He bows his head quickly and then moves away beckoning to
Toby

PIRELLI
Come boy

TOBY
Were pulling out sir 22

Without warning Pirelli SLAPS Toby viciously across the face
--Toby almost falls--

PIRELLI
(snarling)
Were pulling out yes Quickly

Mrs Lovett has observed all of this as she moves away with
Todd who is making his way inexorably toward the Beadle

Some eager customers surround Todd among them is the
TOURIST

EAGER CUSTOMER
Mr Todd sir do you have an
establishment of your own
Mrs Lovett is on him like a hawk

MRS LOVETT
He certainly does Sweeney Todds
Tonsorial Parlor -- above my meatpie
emporium in Fleet Street

Todd has led them right to the Beadle

TODD
I thank you for your honest
adjudication sir You are a paragon
of integrity

BEADLE
Well I try to do my best for my
friends and neighbors Your
establishment is in Fleet Street you
say

TODD

Yes sir

BEADLE

Then Mr Todd you will surely see me
there before the week is out

TODD
You will be welcome Beadle Bamford
and I guarantee to give you without a
pennys charge the closest shave you
will ever know

PAGE 35

EXT STREET -- DAY

Todd and Mrs Lovett are walking away from the marketplace
She chatters happily

MRS LOVETT
Like to give me a coronary right
there What if he had recognized you
Lord my heart was beating a mile a
minute just like a little finch it
was Arent those lovely birds now
Always so twittery and happy

She continues chattering

PAGE

But Todd is not listening
His eyes dart to the side to see--

The Gentleman is walking next to him whispering subtle
insinuating

GENTLEMAN
Sweeney pondered and Sweeney planned
Like a perfect machine e planned

The Banker moves in next to the Gentleman

BANKER
Barbing the hook baiting the trap
Setting it out for the Beadle to snap

The General joins them

GENERAL
Slyly courted im Sweeney did
Set a sort of a scene e did

GENTLEMAN BANKER AND GENERAL
Laying the trail showing the traces
Letting it lead to higher places

Sweeney
The last word echoes And then they are gone
disappearing from Todds mind swallowed up by the crowd

of pedestrians

Todd looks to Mrs Lovett and she continues chattering

23

MRS LOVETT
Suppose its just me gentle heart
but I do hate to see a boy treated
like that no better than your Aunt
Doreens dog -- Mr Todd are you
listening to me

TODD
Of course

But then his eyes dart again -- looking for the specters He
only sees strangers

INT JOHANNAS ROOM -- MORNING 24

Johanna sits framed by the window quietly cutting out
silhouettes Aimless Victorian handicrafts

But we see there are tears in her eyes
She steals a glance across the room We see a small hole in
the wallpaper Through this hole the Judge is watching her

from another chamber Lascivious Perverse

Johanna finally stands and casually glances out from between
the shutters at her window She sees

Anthony standing at the park across the street keeping up
his lonely vigil gazing up at the mansion

She watches him for a moment and then makes her decision She
moves to a table and opens a drawer Reaches in and removes
something

EXT TURPINS MANSION -- MORNING 25
Anthony sees a figure at the shutters -- then hears a

clinking sound Metal on pavement

He quickly moves across the street and looks

A key dropped from above

He looks up to the shutters and smiles then snatches up the
ey and hurries off

INT JOHANNAS ROOM -- MORNING 26

Peering through the shutters Johanna watches him go
We linger on her face and then dissolve to another face also

watching
PAGE

INT BARBER SHOP -- MORNING 27
Her father

Todds face staring out the window intense and brooding
Seething with discontent

Mrs Lovett chatters as she moves around behind him

MRS LOVETT

Its not much of a chair

Ill

grant but itll serve Was me poor
Alberts chair Sat in it all day long
he did after his leg give out from

the gout poor dear

He moves from the window and paces like a caged tiger in the

small barber shop

Though it has been cleaned it is still a spartan room A
tatty parlor chair A large chest A few counters with meager
bottles of tonsorial supplies And his gleaming razors

always waiting

TODD

Why doesnt the Beadle come Before
the week is out thats what he said

MRS LOVETT

And who says the weeks out Its only

Tuesday

Todd moves away from her she pursues

soothe him

MRS LOVETT

Easy now
Hush love hush
Dont distress yourself
Whats your rush
Keep your thoughts
Nice and lush
Wait

(he continues to pace)
Hush love hush
Think it through
Once it bubbles
Then whats to do
Watch it close
Let it brew
Wait

trying to calm and

He does not respond She dares to move closer

PAGE

MRS LOVETT
Ive been thinking flowers--
Maybe daisies--
To brighten up the room
Dont you think some flowers
Pretty daisies
Might relieve the gloom
Ah wait love wait

Todd sourly tosses himself into the chair he picks up his

largest razor and looks at it intensely

TODD
(to razor)
And the Judge When will we get to
him

MRS LOVETT
Cant you think of nothing else
Always broodin away on yer wrongs
what happened heaven knows how many
years ago

Dont you know

Silly man

Half the fun is to

Plan the plan

All good things come to
Those who can

Wait

Her gentle words have calmed him considerably She moves even

closer Risks touching him softly

MRS LOVETT
Gillyflowers maybe
“Stead of daisies

I dont know though
What do you think

Then Todd tilts the razor in his hand--

SUDDENLY -- the face of the GENTLEMAN -- a flash --
in the razor--

Then--

A bell rings from outside the shop -- the effect is

reflected

electric

-- Todd bolts up senses alert -- Mrs Lovett spins to the
door--

PAGE 27

Todd holds his razor open as he moves strategically toward
the door--

We hear footsteps ascending the stairs outside quickly--
Then--
Anthony enters breathless--

ANTHONY
Mr Todd Thank God Ive found you --
(Todd turns closing the
razor as Anthony sees
Mrs Lovett)
Oh Im sorry excuse me

MRS LOVETT
Mrs Lovett sir

ANTHONY
A pleasure maam --
(continues to Todd)
-- You see theres a girl who needs
my help -- such a sad girl and
lonely but beautiful too and--

TODD
Slow down Anthony

ANTHONY

(takes a breath)

Yes Im sorry This girl has a
guardian so tyrannical that he keeps
her locked away But then this morning
she dropped this

(produces the key)

It must be a sign that Johanna
wants me to help her -- thats her
name Johanna -- and Turpin that of
her guardian A judge of some sort

Todd and Mrs Lovett exchange a quick glance as Anthony
continues

ANTHONY
Ive met him Mr Todd and he is -

- unnatural Once he goes to court
Im going to slip into the house and
release her -- and beg her to come

away with me Tonight

MRS LOVETT
Oh this is all terribly romantic

PAGE 27
ANTHONY
Yes but -- you see -- I dont know
anyone in London --
(to Todd)

-- and I need somewhere safe to bring
her till Ive hired a coach to take us
to Plymouth

He looks at Todd deeply

ANTHONY
If I could keep her here just for an
hour or two I would forever be in
your debt

Todd stares at him his mind racing to figure out how this
new twist might aid in his plans

It is Mrs Lovett who smoothly replies

MRS LOVETT
Bring her here dear

ANTHONY

Thank you maam
(to Todd)
Mr Todd

A beat

TODD
The girl may come

ANTHONY
(taking his hand)
Thank you my friend
He goes

PAGE 41

Todd moves again to his post at the window

MRS LOVETT
Seems like the fates are favoring you
at last Mr T
(Todd grunts unhappy)
What is it love Youll have her back
before the day is out

TODD
For a few hours Before he carries her
off to the other end of England

MRS LOVETT
Oh him Let him bring her here and
then since youre so hot for a little
(makes a throat-cutting
gesture)
-- thats the throat to slit dear

deep in thought

Meanwhile

things up and trying to make it all a bit more cozy

Mrs Lovett joins him at the window Below

he stares out

she happily moves around the shop straightening

MRS LOVETT
Poor little Johanna All those years
without a scrap of motherly affection
Well well soon see to that

TODD
(alert sees something)
Whats this

approaching with Toby in tow

MRS LOVETT
Look at that face hes up to
mischief

TODD

Go -- keep the boy below with you
She nods and scurries out We go with her
28 EXT PIE SHOP -- DAY

Mrs Lovett quickly moves down the steps outside the
barber shop to greet Pirelli and Toby as they are about to

ascend
We see a new sign on the stairs Sweeney Todds Tonsorial

staircase blocking their
way looking at Toby)

TOBY

juicy meat pie would yer

PIRELLI
(impatient)
Yes yes whatever you like

Pirelli climbs the stairs as she takes Toby by the hand and
leads him toward the pie shop door

MRS LOVETT
Come with me now Your teeth is

strong I hope

They go into the pie shop
29 INT BARBER SHOP -- DAY 29

Trish)

wager on false pretenses me friend

Todd shakes his head amused and begins to turn away when
Pirelli says

PIRELLI
Mr Benjamin Barker
Todd freezes
30 INT PIE SHOP -- DAY 30

Mrs Lovett hands Toby one of her grisly pies he devours
eagerly

MRS LOVETT
Thats my boy tuck in

But her attention is almost entirely on the roof above
the muffled voices the sound of shoes walking

Her eyes keep darting up as she chatters distractedly with

Toby

MRS LOVETT
Like to see a man with a healthy
appetite Reminds me of my dear
Albert like to gorge himself to
bloatation he did He didnt have
your nice full head though--

TOBY
To tell the truth --
(he pulls off the wig
which covers his own
short-cropped hair)
-- it gets awful hot

INT BARBER SHOP -- DAY

Pirelli is expansively strolling around the shop taking it
all in savoring every second

PAGE 44

PIRELLI
yes this will do very nicely
You dont remember me Well why
should you I was just a down and out
Irish pug you hired for a couple of
weeks -- sweeping up hair and the like
(He picks up one of Todds
razors)
But I remember these -- And how could
I ever forget you Benjamin Barker
(MORE )

PIRELLI (contd)
I would sit right there and watch you
and dream of the day I could be a
proper barber meself You might say
you were an inspiration to me

Todd glares at him

PIRELLI
So do we have a deal or should I run
down the street for me pal Beadle
Bamford What do you say to that now
Mr Sweeney T--

Without a word of warning--
Like a thunderbolt--
Todd is on him

He leaps across the shop and brutally grabs Pirelli by the
neck -- violently strangling him -- Pirelli is surprisingly
strong and puts up a desperate struggle -- they thump
awkwardly around the shop--

32 INT PIE SHOP -- DAY

Mrs Lovett hears the muffled sounds of the struggle above
She nervously begins to shift and clang some things around
she cleans the counter trying to cover the sound
chattering

MRS LOVETT
My my my always work to be done Spic-
and-span thats my motto Cleanliness
is next to whatever-it-is So ah how
did you end up with that dreadful
Eyetalian

TOBY

(still eating happily)
Got me from the workhouse e did Been
there since I was born Got no mum
got nobody A wasted soul thats what
I am --

(a sudden urgent thought)
-- Oh God Hes got an appointment
with his tailor--

He bolts up clearly terrified of Pirelli--

TOBY
If hes late hell blame me--

PAGE 45
32

MRS LOVETT
Wait--

as

But he is gone--
EXT PIE SHOP -- DAY 33
Toby vaults up the stairs to the barber shop--

INT BARBER SHOP -- DAY 34
Todd is standing calmly when Toby bursts in--

TOBY
Signor you got an appointment

He stops when he realizes Pirelli is nowhere to be seen

TODD
Signor Pirelli has been called away
You better run after him

TOBY
Oh no sir I better wait for him here
or itll be a lashing Hes a great
one for the lashings

He moves past Todd to the large chest and sits--

Only now do we see one of Pirellis hands protruding from the
chest dangling limply

Toby doesnt notice it Todd at this moment however does
He smiles nervously

TODD
So hmmm Mrs Lovett gave you a pie
did she

TOBY

Shes a real lady Model of all true
Christian virtue

Then Pirellis hand twitches
Toby doesnt notice Todd does stares at it anxiously
TODD
That she is that she is But if I

know a growing boy theres still room
for some more pie eh

PAGE 46

TOBY
Id say sir -- (pats his stomach) --
An aching void

Pirellis hand begins to twitch more desperately now
perilously close to where Tobys hand rests

TODD
Then why dont you run downstairs and
wait for your master there Therell
be another pie in it for you Im
sure

Pirellis hand is twitching closer to Tobys now

He races

TOBY
No I should stay here

TODD
(a sudden inspiration)
I know -- why dont you tell Mrs
Lovett I said to give you a nice big

tot of gin

TOBY
(leaps up)
Gin sir Thanking you kindly sir
Youre a Christian indeed

out happily and clatters down the stairs

A beat as Todd gets his breath

Then he goes to the trunk leans down to open it the camera
follows him down and up again when he rises--

The GENTLEMAN is standing right behind him

Todd turns

The Gentlemans face is completely impassive He is not
spectral He does not disappear He just stands there

Todd looks at him

Then the Gentlemans eyes slowly move to a counter

Todd follows his look to see

PAGE

His largest razor

A long beat as Todd looks at the razor 34

fq

The point of no return

fq

odd strides to the razor and he snaps it open with a sharp
quick flick of his wrist--

Then he moves to the chest and--

With great ferocity he hauls Pirelli up--
Pirellis eyes snap open--

And Todd SLASHES his throat--

The piercing factory whistle SCREAMS--

fq

odd remains standing over Pirelli as the painful whistle
echoes into music

We see that the Gentleman is still standing there watching
Todd

GENTLEMAN
His hands were quick his fingers strong
It stung a little but not for long

The dashing Oxford Student is now leaning against a wall
arms folded looking at Todd

STUDENT
And those who thought him a simple clod
Were soon reconsidering under the sod

The Tourist stands by the window

TOURIST
Consigned there with a friendly prod
From Sweeney Todd
The Demon Barber of Fleet Street

GENTLEMAN STUDENT AND TOURIST
See your razor gleam Sweeney
Feel how well it fits

As it floats across the throats
Of hypocrites

The last word echoes to silence as we cut to
A high-angle shot of the room
The ghosts are gone

Todd stands alone over Pirellis body Blood dripping from
his razor Drip Drip Drip

INT OLD BAILEY -- DAY 35
Judge Turpin lurks over the proceedings

He sits the personification of power very high at the
bench He glares down a wasted wretch of a BOY The Beadle
stands next to the boy

JUDGE
This is the second time sir that you
have been brought before this bench
Though it is my earnest wish to ever
temper justice with mercy your
persistent dedication to a life of
crime is an abomination before God and
man

He places a black cloth on his head
JUDGE
I therefore sentence you to hang by
the neck until you are dead and may

the Lord have mercy on your soul

The wretched boy collapses in sobs The Beadle is pleased
with the verdict

The Judge removes the black cloth and tosses it casually on
his desk

JUDGE
This court is adjourned

EXT -- STREET -- OUTSIDE THE OLD BAILEY -- DAY 36

The Judge and the Beadle walk away from the impressive
edifices of the Old Bailey

BEADLE

Thank you your Honor Just the
sentence we wanted

JUDGE
Was he guilty

BEADLE
Well if he didnt do it hes surely
done something to warrant a hanging

JUDGE

(quietly)
What man has not

BEADLE
Sir
JUDGE
No matter -- Come walk home with me

I have news for you my friend In
order to shield her from the evils of
this world I have decided to marry my
dear Johanna

BEADLE
Ah sir happy news indeed

JUDGE
Strange though when I offered myself
to her she showed a certain
reluctance

The Beadle proceeds with exquisite and obsequious delicacy

BEADLE
Excuse me my lord
May I request my lord
Permission my lord to speak
Forgive me if I suggest my lord
Youre looking less than your best my lord
Theres powder upon your vest my lord
And stubble upon your cheek
And ladies my lord are weak
As they round a corner the Judge feels his chin

JUDGE
Stubble you say Perhaps at times I
am a little overhasty with my morning
ablutions

BEADLE

(cheerily)

Fret not though my lord
I know a place my lord
A barber my lord of skill
Thus armed with a shaven face my lord
Some eau de cologne to brace my lord
And musk to enhance the chase my lord
Youll dazzle the girl until
She bows to your every will

JUDGE
A barber eh Take me to him

Mrs Lovett is pouring Toby a glass of gin not his first

He gulps down the gin between ravenous bites of another meat
pie as she nervously glances up to the ceiling wondering
what the hell is going on up there

MRS LOVETT
You ought to slow down a bit lad
Itll go to your head

TOBY
Weaned on the stuff I was They used
to give it to us at the workhouse

He casually points the razor toward the chest

She lifts the lid and sees Pirellis body at the bottom of
the chest

MRS LOVETT
(spinning on Todd)
Youre barking mad Killing a man wot
done you no harm

TODD
He recognized me from the old days He
tried to blackmail me -- half my

earnings

MRS LOVETT
(relieved)
Oh well thats a different matter
For a moment there I thought youd
lost your marbles

She looks into the chest again

MRS LOVETT
Ooooh All that blood Enough to make
you come all over gooseflesh aint
it Poor bugger Oh well

She starts to close the chest then has an idea

She reaches in and rummages around the body Pulls out
Pirellis chatelaine purse then drops the lid of the chest

MRS LOVETT

(looking through purse)
Three quid Well waste not want not
I always say

(she tucks the purse into

her dress)

Now what are we going to do about
the boy

TODD
Send him up

She stops looks at him

MRS LOVETT
Oh we dont need to worry about him

with some story

TODD
(cold)
Send him up woman

MRS LOVETT
(quickly)
Now Mr T surely ones enough for
today Dont want to indulge yourself
after all
(she busily starts to

straighten up the room)

Sides I was thinking about
hiring a lad to help around the shop
me poor knees not being what they used
to be

Todd sighs and moves to his familiar post at the window

TODD
Anything you say

MRS LOVETT
Course well have to stock up on the
gin the boy drinks like a Barbary
sailor--

Todd suddenly gasps -- a great shocking intake of breath as
his whole body tenses like iron--

Mrs Lovett spins to him--

TODD
The Judge

Mrs Lovett hurries to the window--

Below they can see the Judge and the Beadle approaching
They see them exchanging a few words and then the Beadle
moves off as the Judge approaches the shop--

Todd whispers his eyes blazing

TODD
Justice Justice

Mrs Lovett gives him a quick kiss and then very quickly
leaves A beat as Todd prepares himself

He turns from the window and looks around the shop shifting
nervously Now that his great moment of revenge is at hand
he doesnt quite know what to do with himself

PAGE 53
38 38

He snatches up his large razor coils by the door ready to
attack No He wants to savor this He quickly moves and puts
the razor down
Finally he just stands All his demons settling into a
bizarre sort of calm

He hears the Judges footsteps approaching on the stairs
Then the Judge enters

JUDGE
Mr Todd

Todd slowly turns

TODD
At your service An honor to
receive your patronage my lord

JUDGE
You know me sir

TODD
(a polite bow)
Who in this wide world is not familiar
with the honored Judge Turpin

The Judge grunts and glances around the shop

JUDGE
These premises are hardly
prepossessing and yet the Beadle tells
me you are the most accomplished of
all the barbers in the city

TODD
That is gracious of him sir
(indicates for the Judge
to sit)
Sit if you please sir Sit

The Judge settles into the parlor chair as music begins

TODD
And what may I do for you today sir
A stylish trimming of the hair A
soothing skin massage

JUDGE
You see sir a man infatuate with love
Her ardent and eager slave
So fetch the pomade and pumice stone
And lend me a more seductive tone

PAGE 54 38
A sprinkling perhaps of French cologne
But first sir I think -- a shave
TODD

The closest I ever gave

He whips a sheet over the Judge then tucks the bib in The
Judge hums flicking imaginary dust off the sheet Todd
whistles gaily

JUDGE
Youre in a merry mood today Mr
Todd

TODD

(mixing lather)
Tis your delight sir catching fire
From one man to the next

JUDGE
Tis true sir love can still inspire
The blood to pound the heart leap higher

BOTH
What more what more can man require--

JUDGE
Than love sir

TODD
More than love sir

JUDGE
What sir
TODD
Women
JUDGE

Ah yes women

TODD
Pretty women

The Judge hums jauntily Todd whistles and starts stropping
his razor rhythmically He then lathers the Judges face

Still whistling Todd stands back to survey the Judge who is
now totally relaxed eyes closed

Todd goes

Youll be commended sir

Then--

With an easy flick of his wrist he just begins to shave the

Judge as

The music approaches a feverish crescendo as Todd prepares to
finally kill the Judge and they sing simultaneously

JUDGE
Pretty women yes
Pretty women sir
Pretty women
Pretty women sir

TODD
Pretty women heres to
Pretty women all the
Pretty women--

Just as the music reaches a climax Todd raises his arm ina
huge arc and is about to slash the Judges throat when--

Suddenly--
Anthony bursts in--
ANTHONY
Mr Todd Ive seen Johanna She said
shell leave with me tonight--
The Judge jumps up away from Todd--
JUDGE
You -- There is indeed a higher power

to warn me thus in time--

He tears off the sheet as he advances savagely on Anthony

( )
PAGE 58
38 38
JUDGE
Johanna elope with you Deceiving
slut -- Ill lock her up in some

obscure retreat where neither you nor
any other vile creature shall ever lay
eyes on her again--

He spins with venom to Todd

JUDGE
And as for you barber it is all too
clear what company you keep Service
them well and hold their custom -- for
youll have none of mine

He strides out
Todd stands frozen
ANTHONY

Mr Todd -- you have to help me --
Ive talked to Johanna and--

Todd suddenly turns on him with a ferocious ROAR

TODD
OUT OUT I SAY

Utterly stunned at his friends ferocity Anthony backs away
leaves the shop

Music begins very agitated as Todd stands motionless
In shock

His mind cracking apart
Mrs Lovett hurries in

MRS LOVETT
All this shouting and running about
whats happened--

TODD
I had him -- and then--

MRS LOVETT
The sailor busted in I know I saw
them both running down the street and
I said--

Todd interrupts wildly

PAGE 38

TODD
I had him
His throat was bare
Beneath my hand--

MRS LOVETT
There there dear Dont fret--

TODD
(spins on her violently)
No I had him
His throat was there
And hell never come again

MRS LOVETT
Easy now
The music

Hush love hush
I keep telling you--

TODD
When

MRS LOVETT
Whats your rush

TODD
Why did I wait
You told me to wait
Now hell never come again

becomes ferocious as Todds wrenching insanity

always close to the surface finally explodes

TODD
Theres a hole in the world
Like a great black pit
And its filled with people
Who are filled with shit
And the vermin of the world
Inhabit it--
But not for long

He suddenly looks to Mrs Lovett -- she starts back --
alarmed by the pure madness in his eyes--

PAGE 60

TODD
They all deserve to die
Tell you why Mrs Lovett
Tell you why
Because in all of the whole human race Mrs Lovett
There are two kinds of men and only two
Theres the one staying put
In his proper place 38

And the one with his foot
In the other ones face--
Look at me Mrs Lovett
Look at you--

He suddenly lurches and grabs Mrs Lovett tightly--

TODD
No we all deserve to die

Even you Mrs Lovett

Even I

Because the lives of the wicked should be--
(slashes at the air
violently)

Made brief

For the rest of us death

Will be a relief--

We all deserve to die

He clutches her to him very tightly as he suddenly keens
howl of pure agony

TODD
And Ill never see Johanna
No Ill never hug my girl to me--

He hurls Mrs Lovett away from him--

TODD
Finished

We suddenly slash to--
EXT STREET -- DAY
--In Todds mind

We are moving with him as he stalks relentlessly holding
razor striding down a busy street like a tiger

his

The many pedestrians he passes dont even notice him He is

invisible to them a wolf among the sheep as he beckons--

TODD
All right You sir
How about a shave
Come and visit
Your good friend Sweeney--

EXT ANOTHER STREET -- DAY

Todd continues to stride beckoning to another man

TODD

Welcome to the grave

TODD

Todd continues to stride beckoning to another man

TODD

EXT ANOTHER STREET -- DAY 43
Todd continues to prowl

TODD
And I will get him back
Even as he gloats
In the meantime Ill practice
On less honorable throats--

EXT ANOTHER STREET -- DAY 44

Todd suddenly falls to his knees keening in anguish--

TODD
And my Lucy lies in ashes
And Ill never see my girl again
But the work waits Im alive at last

(a final exalted cry)

And Im full of JOoooooY

He raises his razor high on the soaring last note as we pull
back our view is suddenly obscured by a strange frenzied
fluttering of black wings We continue to pull back We
discover the black wings are pigeons thousands of them
flying up in a great cloud

We continue to pull back to finally discover that Todd is
kneeling in the heart of a church square

Empty but for him
As his cry ends we slash back to--

INT BARBER SHOP -- DAY

-- Todd is kneeling sweat pouring through his clothes
panting for air

Mrs Lovett stands looking down at him intently

MRS LOVETT
Thats all very well but what are we
going to do about --
(kicks the chest)
-- the dear departed

Todd remains kneeling motionless She goes to him firm
MRS LOVETT
Listen Do you hear me Get a hold of
yourself
She slaps his cheek -- he looks up at her barely seeing her
MRS LOVETT
Oh you great useless thing come on--
She hauls him up and drags him out

He thumps down still in his own dark world

She quickly glances around for Toby and then goes into her

MRS LOVETT
There drink it down -- all the way --

Now we got a body molderin away

do about that

TODD
Later on when its dark well take
him to some secret place and bury him

MRS LOVETT
Well yes of course we could do
that I dont suppose hes got any
relatives going to come poking around
looking for him

uncomprehendingly

MRS LOVETT
Well you know me sometimes bright
ideas just pop right into my head and
I keep thinking
Seems a downright shame

TODD
Shame

MRS LOVETT
Seems an awful waste
Such a nice plump frame
Wots-his-name
Has
Had

PAGE 64

Nor it cant be traced
Business needs a lift--
Debts to be erased--
Think of it as thrift

As a gift
If you get my drift
(Todd has no idea what she
is talking about)
No
(She sighs)
Seems an awful waste
I mean
With the price of meat what it is
When you get it
If you get it--

Todd suddenly understands

TODD
Ah

MRS LOVETT

Good you got it

(She warms to the idea)
Take for instance
Mrs Mooney and her pie shop
Business never better using only
Pussycats and toast
And a pussys good for maybe six or
Seven at the most
And Im sure they cant compare
As far as taste--

TODD
Mrs Lovett
What a charming notion

The music builds as they sing simultaneously

TODD
Eminently practical and yet
Appropriate as always
Mrs Lovett how Ive lived without
All these years Ill never know
How delectable

you

Also undetectable

How choice
How rare

MRS LOVETT
Well it does seem a
Waste
Its an idea
Think about it
Lots of other gentlemen1l
Soon be coming for a shave

Wont they

A triumphant waltz theme begins

They sing

TODD
For whats the sound of the world out there

MRS LOVETT

What is that sound

TODD
Those crunching noises pervading the air

MRS LOVETT
Yes Mr Todd

And who are we

To deny it in here

MRS LOVETT

Then who are we
To deny it in here
Music continues under

TODD
Ah these are desperate times Mrs
Lovett and desperate measures are
called for

She goes to the counter and comes back with an imaginary pie

MRS LOVETT
Here we are now hot out of the
oven

She holds the imaginary pie out to him with a sly and wicked
smile

PAGE 48

TODD
What is that

MRS LOVETT
Its priest
Have a little priest

TODD
Is it really good

MRS LOVETT
Sir its too good
At least
Then again they dont commit sins of the flesh
So its pretty fresh

Awful lot of fat

MRS LOVETT

TODD
Havent you got poet

Mrs Lovett presents another imaginary pie

MRS LOVETT

No you see the trouble with poet

TODD

Mmm Heavenly

MRS LOVETT

Not as hearty as bishop

MRS LOVETT
Lawyers rather nice

TODD
If its for a price

MRS LOVETT

Order something else though

Since no one should swallow

It twice

TODD
Anything thats lean

MRS LOVETT

Well then if youre British and loyal

You might enjoy Royal
Marine
Anyway its clean

Though of course it tastes of wherever its been

TODD

(looking past her to

imaginary oven)
Is that squire
On the fire

MRS LOVETT
Mercy no sir
Look closer
Youll notice its grocer

TODD
Looks thicker
More like vicar

MRS LOVETT
No it has to be grocer -- its green

Todd laughs as the glorious waltz theme returns

The music

TODD
The history of the world my love--

MRS LOVETT
Save a lot of graves

particular flamboyant panache

purposeful)

The music vamps deliciously as

MRS LOVETT
True we dont have Judge -- yet --
but would you settle for the next best
thing

TODD
Whats that

She offers him a butchers cleaver

MRS LOVETT
Executioner

He takes the cleaver feels the heft of it Feels good

Then he picks up her wooden rolling pin hands it to her

The Beadle covers her mouth with one of his huge hands and
hauls her out--

the carriage clatters off--

Judge Turpin stands on the steps of the mansion -- Anthony

ANTHONY
Where are you taking her Tell me or

The Judge spins and roars -- a hellish howl that echoes--
JUDGE

EXT FLEET STREET -- DAY 51

The face of the Beggar Woman

She sits crouched on her haunches peering up from under her
few greasy locks of hair

She is watching something intently A few pedestrians move
quickly down the sidewalk past her excited They chatter
back and forth eagerly

The Beggar Woman uncoils and follows

And we finally see what the Beggar Woman has been watching so
intently

EXT PIE SHOP -- DAY 52
Mrs Lovetts wretched establishment has been transformed

She has created a modest outdoor eating garden with tables
surrounded by glowing Chinese lanterns A fresh coat of
paint a few bushes in pots and birds in cages add to the
feeling of upward mobility

A new sign hangs proudly over the entrance to the pie shop
MRS LOVETTS WORLD FAMOUS MEAT PIES And then in smaller
letters LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE

The eating garden is already crowded the benches at the
tables are filled and other customers stand and mill about

All eating eating eating

The most delicious looking meat pies you could ever
imagine Crispy crust Thick luxurious gravy Tart and tangy
meat

The customers take great hungry mouthfuls the steaming
gravy oozing down greedy faces

Chomp Chomp Chomp

The Beggar Women stands across the street ravenously hungry
She finally gets the nerve to approach when--

Toby -- wearing a spiffy new outfit with apron -- bursts from
the shop and circulates through the customers

TOBY
Ladies and gentlemen
May I have your attention perlease
Are your nostrils aquiver and tingling as well
At that delicate luscious ambrosial smell
Yes they are I can tell

PAGE 73

He moves through the greedily eating customers in the outdoor
garden and toward the street as

TOBY
Well ladies and gentlemen
That aroma enriching the breeze
Is like nothing compared to its succulent source
As the gourmets among you will tell you of course

He arrives at the street and drums up some more business

TOBY

Ladies and gentlemen
You cant imagine the rapture in store--

(Indicating the pie shop)
Just inside of this door
There youll sample
Mrs Lovetts meat pies
Savory and sweet pies
As youll see
You who eat pies
Mrs Lovetts meat pies
Conjure up the treat pies
Used to be

Just then Mrs Lovett sweeps from the pie shop with a tray of
hot steaming pies

Like her shop she has been transformed as well She wears
her somewhat gauche notion of a fancy dress Buckets of
decolletage And her hair has been dyed a rather unique
aubergine color

MRS LOVETT

The customers suddenly exclaim their joy through awkward

mastication -- chewing and gulping and snapping at the
heavenly pies

The music comes to a rousing conclusion as Mrs Lovett stands
at the door to her shop Triumphant

INT BARBER SHOP -- NIGHT
Todd is alone He sits in the barber chair smoking a pipe
He is holding an old Daguerreotype creased stained and
bleached-out
The image shows his wife Lucy smiling and holding Baby
Johanna The childs features are almost completely obscured
by a stain on the picture
He looks at it deeply
Then church bells echo in the distance
EXT MAYFAIR -- NIGHT

The church bells continue as we discover Anthony

searching through the streets for Johanna We see him in long
shot as he moves through the contours of the city

He starts his search in a luxurious area of wealth His
journey through the city will take him lower and lower
the darkest corners of London

ANTHONY
I feel you Johanna
I feel you
Do they think that walls can hide you
Even now Im at your window
I am in the dark beside you
Buried sweetly in your yellow hair
Johanna

He continues walking

TODD
Goodbye Johanna

trapdoor in the floor down a chute -- Todd pulls the lever

again and the chair returns to its normal position

INT BAKEHOUSE STEPS -- DUSK 65

claustrophobic series of steps down to the bakehouse She
unbolts and pulls aside a heavy iron door and enters

We remain outside A fiery red glow spills out -- the roar of
the oven within is thundering

She approaches the pie shop the agitated music matching her
increasing frenzy She grabs a stunned Toby -- who is
carrying some packages toward the pie shop

BEGGAR WOMAN
(panicked)
Quick sir Run and tell
Warn em all of the witchs spell

She spots Mrs Lovett emerging from the pie shop and explodes

in desperation pointing madly

Toby pulls away from her as she begins to scuttle off

Toby turns to consider the horrible black smoke belching from
the chimney of the pie shop Something about the foul ebony
smoke troubles him

INT BARBER SHOP -- DAY 75

82 EXT HAMPSTEAD HEATH -- DAY 82

Mrs Lovett and Todd rest on a picnic blanket just like any
other couple out enjoying the fine day

The remains of a nice picnic lunch are scattered around them
and Toby can be seen flying a kite a bit away

Mrs Lovett watches happy couples moving about dogs and
kids running hither and yon military officers squiring
their ladies nurses with prams
Todd is distinctly ill at ease brooding as she chatters

MRS LOVETT

which is not to say we couldnt
get some nice taxidermy animals to
bring a touch of gentility to the
place You know a boars head or
two

(glancing at the

unresponsive Todd)
Mr T are you listening to me

TODD
Of course

MRS LOVETT
Then what did I just say
TODD
(back in his somber
reflections)
There must be a way to the Judge

MRS LOVETT

(snaps)
The bloody old Judge Always harping
on the bloody old Judge

Eat you up I really could
You know what Id like to Do Mr Todd

Of course

MRS LOVETT

Yes yes I do I do

The music continues as she leans back comfortably
to imagine a wonderful domestic future
MRS LOVETT
Ive always had this dream of living
at the seaside I got a picture

(notes Toby flying his
kite)
And all that fresh aquatic airs bound

Anything you say

MRS LOVETT
Wouldnt that be smashing

And we go to

EXT BEACH -- DAY
In Mrs Lovetts mind

She and Todd sit in the exact same positions as in Hampstead
Heath Only now they are sitting on a beach

They are wearing what she imagines as fashionable seaside
bathing clothes

Toby who is not consumptively pale but overly rosy-cheeked
in her fantasy is building a sandcastle nearby

Mrs Lovett is sitting with her Dream Todd of course so he
has a bland smile on his face Somewhat unnatural

In fact there is something vaguely unreal and stilted about
all of this

MRS LOVETT (VO)
With the sea at our gate
Well have kippered herring
Wot have swum to us straight
From the Straits of Bering
Every night in the kip
When were through our kippers
Ill be there slippin off your
slippers
By the sea
With the fishies splashing
By the sea
Wouldnt that be smashing

92 INT SEASIDE COTTAGE -- MORNING

Mrs Lovett is placing a plate of kippers on the table amidst
a proper English breakfast A guest stands leaning against a
wall waiting to eat

MRS LOVETT (VO)
By the sea in our nest
We could share our kippers
With the odd paying guest
From the weekend trippers
Have a nice sunny suite
For the guest to rest in--

A dark shape quickly moves past the guest -- Todd -- then the
guest slides down the wall -- a splash of blood on the
wallpaper-

MRS LOVETT (VO)
Now and then you could do the guest in--

around her two men

We cut back to--
EXT HAMPSTEAD HEATH -- DAY 94

--Mrs Lovett is sitting in the exact same position with
Todd Silence

Her smiles fades as she considers him The grim brooding
reality is so clear next to her lovely dream

She watches him in silence as we fade to
INT BARBER SHOP -- MORNING 95

Todd is standing at his usual post the window gazing
intently down at Fleet Street

Mrs Lovett enters with a tray of food

MRS LOVETT
Brought you some breakfast dear farm
fresh eggs and a dollop of lovely
clotted cream only the best for my
She stops when he realizes he isnt even listening to her
Her heart sinks seeing him at the window wearing his
obsession like a cloak

A beat as she looks at him

MRS LOVETT
Mr T might I ask you a question

TODD
(not turning)

MRS LOVETT
What did your Lucy look like

He turns to her

PAGE 92
95 95

MRS LOVETT
You heard me (a beat) Cant
really remember can you

TODD
She had yellow hair

He turns back to the window
Mrs Lovett proceeds with great sincerity

MRS LOVETT
Youve got to leave all this behind
you now Shes gone You keep
looking down into the grave youre
never gonna look up And life will
just pass right by Life is for the
alive my dear

He does not answer

MRS LOVETT
We could have a life we two Maybe
not like I dreamed maybe not like you
remember But we could get by

He does not answer

MRS LOVETT
Come away from the window
A long beat
He finally turns from the window Almost as if to leave his
demons behind
She smiles quietly and holds out her hand
She begins to cross to him
SUDDENLY REVEALING--
The Gentleman
Standing right behind Mrs Lovett--
He is glaring at Todd relentless and accusatory--

Blood pouring from his throat--

A shocking horror movie vision--

Then the bell rings outside the shop Todd turns the
Gentleman is gone we hear footsteps climbing the
stairs

Mrs Lovett remains standing her hand out to him as--

Anthony enters absolutely exhausted

ANTHONY
Mr Todd Mrs Lovett maam

not slept in a week -- but its done--
TODD

What is it Anthony
ANTHONY
(bitter)
He has her locked in a madhouse

Todds head snaps to Anthony riveted

TODD
Youve found Johanna

ANTHONY
For all the good itll do -- its
impossible to get to her

Todd begins pacing the tiger again his mind is racing--

TODD
A madhouse A madhouse Where

ANTHONY
Foggs Asylum But Ive circled the
place a dozen times Theres no way
in Its a fortress

Anthony fades to a brooding silence as Todd continues pacing
thinking thinking Mrs Lovett watches him concerned

Todd suddenly stops

We see him settling into an inspired sort of calm as if he
can finally see the Promised Land

TODD
(a whisper)
Ive got him

ANTHONY

TODD
(to Anthony)
Weve got her Where do you suppose

all the wigmakers of London go to
obtain their human hair Bedlam They
get their hair from the lunatics at
Bedlam--

ANTHONY
I dont understand--

Todd suddenly grabs Anthony and hauls him up -- holds him

close forehead to forehead -- his whispered intensity truly
disturbing

TODD
We shall set you up as a wigmaker in

search of hair -- that will gain you
access -- then you will take her

ANTHONY
Yes

TODD

You will not be deterred -- You will
slaughter the world -- To bring her
here

ANTHONY
Yes

Mrs Lovett watches troubled as Todd embraces Anthony
closely He holds him for a long beat

Then Todd is all action hurries to get some money and gives
it to Anthony as
TODD
Go and outfit yourself properly -- you
are to be a gentlemen wigmaker When
you return we shall dispatch a letter
to this Mr Fogg announcing your

arrival Go -- quickly now

Mrs Lovett goes

96 EXT PIE SHOP -- MORNING
Mrs Lovett begins going down the stairs outside the barber
shop
Then she stops She stands for a long moment disturbed that
Todds demons are again devouring him
She looks down and sees Toby washing the tables in the
outdoor garden Toby is serious about his work vigorously
scrubbing the tables with soap and water
She watches him for a moment and then continues down the
steps
MRS LOVETT

Todd pounces like a panther--

He suddenly leaps up and grabs Toby by the throat with
shocking brutality--

TODD
DONT CHATTER BOY You are not to
stop You are not to speak You are to
deliver this letter DO YOU
UNDERSTAND

Toby is stunned and terrified It is the first time he has
seen this side of his friend Mr Todd

Todd releases him Toby races out

Todd immediately begins pacing like a caged animal back and
forth back and forth whispering to himself neurotically as

day becomes evening

101 EXT PIE SHOP -- EVENING

Toby walks back to the pie shop upset

He stops when he sees Todd at the window above unblinking
gazing like a falcon into the street

He continues on to Mrs Lovett who is clearing up the
remains of a meal in the outdoor garden

PAGE 97

He sits

A beat

She

expression is deeply troubled

TOBY

She pulls him down to her again agitated her mind racing

MRS LOVETT

Hush now Toby hush Here you
just sit next to me nice and quiet
(calming)

How could you think such a thing
of Mr Todd whos been so good to us

He calms down a bit as she holds him

And she comes to a painful dreadful decision

MRS LOVETT
Nothings gonna harm you
Not while Im around
Nothings gonna harm you darling
Not while Im around
(He leans into her)
Demons1ll charm you
With a smile
For a while
But in time
Nothings gonna harm you

The music continues as she holds him There are tears in her
eyes But we see that her gentle song has calmed him

PAGE 101
MRS LOVETT
(softly)
Funny we should be having this little
chat right now Cause I was just

thinkin you know how youve always
fancied coming into the bakehouse with
me to help make the pies

Yes maam

She quickly dries her eyes and then turns him to look at her

MRS LOVETT

(smiles)
Well no time like the present
INT BAKEHOUSE STEPS -- EVENING 102

Mrs Lovett leads Toby down the claustrophobic long stairway
toward the bakehouse

TOBY
My heart bleeds for you havin to go
up and down all these stairs

MRS LOVETT
Well thatll be your job now
TOBY
Yes maam

She arrives at the heavy iron door to the bakehouse We can
hear the seismic rumble of the bake oven within

She unbolts the door and ushers Toby in

And we finally enter

103 INT THE BAKEHOUSE -- EVENING 103
A macabre vision of Hell
The roof hangs low in this subterranean chamber The grisly
tools of her trade are scattered about the place a large
stained chopping block a meat grinder buckets of
questionable viscous liquid cleavers and bone saws and meat
hooks wet sewer grates for the blood
A metal sheet hinged at the top has been attached to cover
an opening in the wall the mouth of the chute from the
barber shop above

PAGE 101
103 103
And eeriest of all the thundering roar of flame coming

from a large industrial oven against one wall
Toby takes in the cavernous bakehouse

TOBY
Coo quite a stink aint there

She indicates the sewer grates

MRS LOVETT
Those grates go right down to the
sewers and the whiffs come up always
a few rats gone home to Jesus down
there

TOBY
So -- where do I start

She leads him across to the thrumming fiery oven

MRS LOVETT
Now this would be the bake oven
Ten dozen at a time Always be sure
the doors is closed properly like
this

TOBY
(trying to remember it
all)
Yesm always closed properly

She leads him to the meat grinder

MRS LOVETT
And heres the grinder
(demonstrates it)
You pop in the meat give it a
good grind and it comes out here

TOBY
(practicing with the
grinder)
Good grind comes out there

MRS LOVETT

She leans against the bakehouse door tormented gasping for
air Then she slowly bolts the door

105 INT FOGGS ASYLUM -- EVENING 105

A cacophony of madness The ragged inmates of the asylum are
slammed together in a series of cramped cells the low
ceiling pressing down

We discover Anthony dressed as a fashionable wigmaker
walking past the cells with the odious MR FOGG Fogg carries
a large pair of scissors

FOGG
Oh yes sir I agree it would be
to our mutual interest to come to some
arrangement in regard to my poor
childrens hair

He moves to one of the cells and unlocks it
FOGG
I keep the blondes over here It was
yellow hair you was looking for sir

ANTHONY
Yes

Fogg goes into the crowded cell -- the inmates all blonde
women scurry back clearly terrified of Fogg Anthony sees
Johanna wearing a filthy straitjacket hunched like a feral
animal cowering in a corner of the cell

ANTHONY

(points)
That one has hair the shade I need

PAGE 103
105 105

Fogg goes to fetch Johanna hauls her to Anthony

FOGG
Come child Smile for the gentleman
and you shall have a sweetie

Johannas eyes shoot wide when she sees Anthony but she says
nothing
FOGG
(prepares scissors)
Now where shall I cut

Before Fogg can react -- Anthony pulls a revolver from his
clothing grabs Johanna and pushes Fogg back into the cell
He swings the cell door shut locking Fogg in

ANTHONY
Not a word Mr Fogg or it will be
your last Now I leave you to the

mercy of your children

He grabs Johanna and pulls her away

Mr Fogg turns He is locked in with the blonde inmates They

slowly begin to advance on him Menacing It is likely they
are going to rip him limb from limb

106 EXT PIE SHOP -- EVENING

Todd and Mrs Lovett are hurrying down the stairs from the
barber shop urgent Todd has a razor
MRS LOVETT
I got him locked in -- but if he
escapes hell go to the law
TODD
Then he cant escape

could--

MRS LOVETT

Excuse me sir -- You gave me a
fright

BEADLE

Not my intention good madam though I
am here on official business

(elaborately prepares a

pinch of snuff)
You see theres been complaints
About the stink from your chimney
They say at night its something most
foul Health regulations -- and the
general public welfare naturally --
being my duty Im afraid Ill have to
take a look

(inhales the snuff

Sneezes and daintily

wipes his nose)

at your bakehouse

TODD
(smoothly)
Of course But first why dont you
come upstairs and let me attend to
you

BEADLE
Much as I do appreciate tonsorial
adornment I really ought see to my
official obligations first

TODD
An admirable sentiment -- But I must
ask you out of professional curiosity
you understand is that a cream or a
tallow pomade

BEADLE
(touches his hair)
Oh not a pomade at all Me secret is
a touch of ambergris

TODD
But sir hair that delicate requires
a genuine pomade Come along let me
show you the difference

BEADLE
(considering)
Well you are the expert in these
matters

PAGE 106

TODD
And well finish you off with a nice
facial rub of bay rum

BEADLE
Oooh bay rum is bracing

TODD
And all on the house for my friend
Beadle Bamford

BEADLE
Well sir I take that very kindly
Lead on

TODD
(bowing)

I am sir entirely at your --
(his eyes flit to Mrs
Lovett)

-- disposal

He leads the Beadle away
Mrs Lovett allows herself a breath
EXT PIE SHOP -- EVENING 107

From across the street we see Todd leading the Beadle up the
stairs to the barber shop chatting with him easily

We realize we are seeing the perspective of the Beggar Woman
hunched across the street watching them closely

INT BAKEHOUSE -- EVENING 108
Toby is eating a pie as he slowly wanders around the
bakehouse

He stops to consider the many stained cleavers and bone saws
curious

Then he bites on something hard -- stops -- he reaches into
his mouth and pulls something out Looks at it

It is a fingernail
To be exact it is the severed tip of a finger
Toby drops it in horror and starts back--

Suddenly a loud THUMPING and CLANGING makes him spin
alarmed--

As --

The bloody body of the Beadle EXPLODES SUDDENLY from the
mouth of the chute--

Toby screams and races to the door--

Pulls at it Locked No use He bangs on the heavy iron door
wildly

TOBY

MRS LOVETT MRS LOVETT LET ME OUT
MRS LOVETT

The thundering roar from the bake oven seems to rise to match
his frenzy as--

In panic Toby races to the sewer grate yanks it up and
disappears down into the sewers as the shrill factory whistle

SCREAMS and we cut to--

INT BARBER SHOP -- EVENING

Todd stands by the chair his razor high--
His eyes blazing--

His face covered in a spray of blood--
Lost in rapture

Not for long

fq

The Gentleman the Banker the General move into the frame
with purpose impatient

The Gentleman flicks out his handkerchief and begins to clean
the blood off Todds face -- he is not gentle the blood

smears-—

GENTLEMAN
The engine roared the motor hissed
And who could see how the road would twist

Meanwhile the Banker pulls off Todds stained barber tunic
and hands Todd his jacket--

BANKER
In Sweeneys ledger the entries matched

A Beadle arrived and a Beadle dispatched

Meanwhile the General is cleaning up the blood on the barber

chair--

Todd sees that more and more of the ghastly specters are
moving around the room -- multiplying exponentially -- we see
the TOURIST the STUDENT the PRIEST and others

They are more intrusive than they have ever been -- touching
Todd -- eagerly preparing him for the finale of his drama --

111 INT BARBER SHOP -- NIGHT

Anthony and Johanna hurry into the barber shop She is now
dressed as a scruffy boy a cap hiding her hair She is
distracted and disturbed
ANTHONY
Mr Todd No matter You wait for
him here -- Ill return with the coach
in less than half an hour
She gently touches Todds collection of razors
ANTHONY

She picks up the largest razor looks at it an eerie echo of
her father

JOHANNA
(darkly ironic)
Safe So we run away and then all
our dreams come true

ANTHONY
I hope so

JOHANNA
I have never had dreams Only
nightmares
ANTHONY
Johanna When were free of this
place all the ghosts will go away

She looks at him very intensely

JOHANNA
No Anthony they never go away

He gently touches her face
ANTHONY
Ill be right back to you Half an
hour and well be free

He goes

She turns to the window watches him go Her expression is
sad he will never fully comprehend her depth

Then she sees the Beggar Woman approaching from across the
street

112 EXT PIE SHOP -- NIGHT 112
The Beggar Woman begins climbing the stairs to the barber
shop
BEGGAR WOMAN

BEGGAR WOMAN (VO)
Beadle Beadle

Johanna looks around urgently sees the large chest She
quickly climbs into it and shuts the lid as--

The Beggar Woman enters
BEGGAR WOMAN
Beadle dear Beadle

The room has a strange effect on her as if she were vaguely
recalling some distant dream She intones to pretty lullaby

music
BEGGAR WOMAN
Beadle deedle deedle deedle deedle dumpling
Beadle dumpling Be-deedle dumpling
SUDDENLY--
Without warning -- like a thunderbolt -- Todd leaps into the
room-—

TODD
What are you doing here

BEGGAR WOMAN
(clutching at his arm)
Ah evil is here sir The stink of
evil -- from below -- from her
(calling)
Beadle dear Beadle

He looks anxiously out the window for the Judge
TODD
Be quiet woman

BEGGAR WOMAN
(still clutching at him)
Shes the Devils wife Oh beware
her sir She with no pity
(slowing looking at him
more closely)
in her heart

TODD
Out of here Now

PAGE

113 113

BEGGAR WOMAN
(really peering at him
now)
Hey dont I know you mister

Todd suddenly sees -- the Judge -- walking toward the shop--
Todd has no time--

The music THUNDERS as--—

In one brutal motion -- he swings around and grabs his razor -
- fiercely SLASHES her throat -- tosses her in the chair --
pulls the lever -- she slides through the floor--

He pulls the chair back to its normal position just as--
The Judge enters

JUDGE
Where is she Wheres the girl

TODD
Below your Honor With my neighbor
Thank heavens the sailor did not
molest her Thank heavens too she
has seen the error of her ways

JUDGE
She has

TODD
Oh yes sir your lesson was well
learned She speaks only of you
longing for forgiveness

JUDGE
Then she shall have it Shell be here
soon you say

The music builds the pace increases

TODD
I think I hear her now

JUDGE
(excited)
Oh excellent my friend

TODD
Is that her dainty footstep on the stair

JUDGE
I hear nothing

Todd gets

TODD
Yes isnt that her shadow on the
wall

JUDGE
Youre in a merry mood again today

TODD
(joyfully)

Pretty women

JUDGE
What we do for

They sing simultaneously as Todd smoothes bay rum on the
Judges face and then reaches for his razor

JUDGE
Pretty women

Blowing out their candles
Combing out their hair--
Then they leave--

Even when they leave you
And vanish they somehow
Can still remain

There with you there

TODD
Pretty women

Blowing out their candles
Or combing out their hair

Even when they leave
They still
Are there
Theyre there
The music builds dangerously as

JUDGE
How seldom it is one meets a fellow
spirit
TODD
With fellow tastes -- in women at
least

JUDGE
What Whats that

TODD
The years no doubt have changed me
sir

TODD (contd)
But then I suppose the face of a

barber -- the face of a prisoner in
the dock -- is not particularly
memorable

JUDGE

(a horrified realization)
Benjamin Barker

TODD
BENJAMIN BARKER

The factory whistle screams a steady terrible blast as--
Todd brutally SLASHES the Judges throat--

Severing his jugular--

The spray of blood drenches Todd--

He pulls the lever and sends the body tumbling out of sight
down the chute

The music continues

As Todd stands for a long moment blood dripping from his
face exalted

Then he sinks to his knees overcome
The music stops

A long beat of silence
Then Todd looks at his razor deeply
TODD
Rest now my friend
Rest now forever
Sleep now the untroubled
Sleep of the angels

Then silence as he reverently sets the razor on the floor and
looks at it

We focus on his face
His quest is completed
His demons silenced

The ghosts are gone

( )
PAGE 115
113 113
Its done

He just kneels there No reason to move No purpose in life
Then

A sound from the chest A slight thump

His eyes dart to the chest

He slowly picks up his razor and moves to the chest Then
suddenly WRENCHES it open and HAULS out Johanna--

TODD
(darkly)
Come for a shave have you lad

JOHANNA
No -- I

He tosses her in the chair throws back his arm his razor
ready--

TODD
Surely yes Everyone needs a good
shave--

SUDDENLY -- A PIERCING SCREAM ECHOES UP FROM THE CHUTE --
Mrs Lovetts voice -- screaming to raise the dead--

Todd rivets Johanna pointing the razor at her a lethal
warning

TODD
Forget my face
He spins and bolts out of the shop leaving her sitting in
the chair--

114 INT BAKEHOUSE -- NIGHT 114

Mrs Lovett is standing in horror by the mouth of the chute
The Judge still barely alive clutches at her skirt--

She tries to wrench herself away from his vise-like grip--

MRS LOVETT
Die Die God in heaven -- die

The Judges fingers finally relax their grip he is dead

Panting Mrs Lovett backs away from him and for the first
time notices the body of the Beggar Woman

PAGE 116
114 114

MRS LOVETT
You Can it be Have all the demons of
Hell come to torment me

She grabs the Beggar Woman and starts dragging her quickly
toward the oven as Todd races in

TODD
Why did you scream Does the Judge
live still

MRS LOVETT
He was clutching holding on to my

dress but hes finished now

She continues quickly dragging the Beggar Woman toward the
oven

TODD
Leave them to me Open the doors

He waves her toward the oven--
MRS LOVETT
No Dont touch her

TODD
Open the doors

He shoves her toward the oven and leans over to pick up the
Beggar Womans body--

TODD
Whats the matter with you Its only
a silly old beggar--
Then -- Mrs Lovett opens the oven doors--

The thundering roar from the oven crashes through the room as
the fiery light slashes across the floor--

Clearly illuminating the face of the Beggar Woman

A chord of music as Todd realizes who she is Music continues
and builds as

TODD
Oh no Oh God Dont I know

you she said

He looks up to Mrs Lovett

PAGE

114 114

TODD
You knew she lived From the moment
that I came into your shop you knew my
Lucy lived

MRS LOVETT
I was only thinking of you

TODD
(looking down again)
Lucy

MRS LOVETT
Your Lucy A crazy hag picking bones
and rotten spuds out of alley ashcans
PAGE 118

Would you have wanted to know she
ended up like that

TODD
(looking up)
You lied to me

MRS LOVETT
(desperately)
No no not lied at all
No I never lied

TODD
(to Beggar Woman)
Lucy

MRS LOVETT

Said she took the poison -- she did --

Never said that she died --
Poor thing
She lived--
TODD
Ive come home again

MRS LOVETT
But it left her weak in the head

All she did for months was just lie there in bed--

TODD
Lucy

MRS LOVETT
Shouldve been in hospital
Wound up in Bedlam instead
Poor thing

114 TODD
Oh my God

MRS LOVETT

Better you should think she was dead

(passionately)
Yes I lied cos I love you

TODD

Lucy

MRS LOVETT
Id be twice the wife she was
I love you
Could that thing have cared for you
Like me

TODD
(a harrowing keen)
WHAT HAVE I DONE

Todds eyes suddenly snap up to Mrs Lovett -- as the
glorious Little Priest waltz theme returns--

TODD
Mrs Lovett
Youre a bloody wonder
Eminently practical and yet
Appropriate as always
As youve said repeatedly
Theres little point in dwelling on the past

He steps toward her she steps back unsure as they sing
simultaneously

TODD
No come here my love
Not a thing to fear
My love
Whats dead
Is dead

MRS LOVETT
Do you mean it
Everything I did I swear I thought
Was only for the best
Believe me
(a heartbreaking plea)
Can we still be
Married

Todd steps toward her darkly

PAGE 119
114 114

She knows she is doomed
But steps into his arms anyway for a final triumphant waltz

TODD
The history of the world my pet--

MRS LOVETT
(through tears)
Oh Mr Todd
Ooh Mr Todd
Leave it to me

TODD
Is learn forgiveness and try to forget

MRS LOVETT
(the lost dream)
By the sea Mr Todd
Well be comfy-cozy
By the sea Mr Todd
Where theres no one nosy

He waltzes her toward the roaring oven
She offers no resistance fully aware of whats coming

The blazing thundering inferno of the oven makes it seem
they are the damned dancing through Hell

TODD
And life is for the alive my dear
So lets keep living it--
BOTH
Just keep living it
Really living it--
The music reaches a thundering crescendo as--
He flings her into the oven and slams the doors--

We hear her screaming And banging on the oven doors

Todd sinks to his knees and covers his ears desperately as
the banging and screaming and music finally fade to silence

Then he slowly drags himself across the floor to the Beggar
Woman

He cradles her head in his arms

PAGE 120
114 114

TODD
There was a barber and his wife
And she was beautiful
A foolish barber and his wife
She was his reason and his life
And she was beautiful
And she was virtuous
And he was

Todd folds himself over his dead wife
The only sound his deep anguished sobs
A long beat

Then he becomes aware of something He looks over to see

Toby -- staring at him from the open sewer grate He has seen
everything

Todd watches as Toby silently pulls himself up Todd gently
sets Lucy down and then still kneeling turns to face Toby

A long beat as they look at each other

Then Toby slowly moves and carefully picks up Todds razor
Todd looks at him

Then slowly unbuttons his collar and exposes his neck

He bends his head back offering his naked throat

Toby slowly goes to him and methodically slits his throat
Todd continues to gaze up at Toby as we hear the lonely sound
of wind escaping from his severed wind pipe

Then Toby turns and leaves the bakehouse

Todd leans forward dying

We cut to his point-of-view

The rough brick floor

From the bottom of the frame
A dark pool of blood slowly begins to spread moving up

the frame the fiery glow from the bake oven reflected in
the blood
( )
PAGE 121
114 114

Finally the pool of blood fills the entire frame

We realize this is the first image we saw in the story
Todds perspective Todds blood As he dies

As before the Gentlemans face appears reflected in the
pool of blood

GENTLEMAN
Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd
His skin was pale and his eye was odd

The Banker emerges from the shadows of the bakehouse

BANKER
He shaved the faces of gentlemen
Who never thereafter were heard of again

The General emerges and the Tourist and the Priest
and the Student

GHOSTS

Of fancy clients and good renown

She is joined by the Judge

And what if none of their souls were saved
They went to their maker impeccably shaved

considering the meat

we begin to move urgently through the

ghosts Their long shadows tower bizarrely against the walls

and ceiling of the bakehouse

oven builds in intensity

GHOSTS
(variously)

Sweeney wishes the world away
Sweeneys weeping for yesterday
Hugging the blade waiting the years
Hearing the music that nobody hears
Sweeney waits in the parlor hall
Sweeney leans on the office wall
No one can help nothing can hide you--
Isnt that Sweeney there beside you
Sweeney wishes the world away
Sweeneys weeping for yesterday
Is Sweeney
There he is its Sweeney
Sweeney Sweeney

The fiery red roar of the bake

We tear through them with increasing frenzy -- cutting
quickly vertiginous angles --

alone continuing to glare ate

fading into the shadows of
and Mrs Lovett alone

Todd and Mrs Lovett stand

ach other

Finally she gives him a grim little smile and disappears into
the darkness

He stands alone

And we cut to--

A series of images from earlier in our story cut to the music
Todds life flashing before his eyes --

The images building as the music races toward its conclusion--
Todd singing -- slashing -- smiling -- striding--

The final crash of music at the final image

Todd kneeling hunched over the pool of blood on the
bakehouse floor

He falls
Into the blood
Dead
