ZOMBIELAND

Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick

Sept 18 2007
We begin with a SONG WOODY GUTHRIE’S ‘THIS LAND IS YOUR
LAND’ CATCHY PATRIOTIC WARM Recorded in mono played
on a scratchy old phonograph

The following is shot gritty Kinetic Fast Scary Very
‘28 Days Later’ ‘Saving Private Ryan’ ‘Children of Men’

FADE UP ON

An AMERICAN FLAG filling the screen flapping A male
voice belonging to FLAGSTAFF a witty anxiety-ridden
EVERYMAN late-twenties (THINK SETH GREEN) narrates

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
This land is your land

The camera rotates on its axis until the flag is UPSIDE DOWN
then pulls back to reveal that it is one of those flags

flying on the hood of a PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE which itself
is upside-down crashed and overturned ON TOP of another car

The further we pull back the more we see of a destroyed
burning Washington DC

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
This land is my land

Suddenly rapid FOOTSTEPS The camera jiggles nervously
trying to find their source Rapidly the footsteps become
LOUD like someone running on sheet-metal

BOOM-BOOM-BOOM A ZOMBIE bleeding from the eyes runs UP
the other side of the tangled mess of automobiles plants a
foot on the underside of the limo and LONG-JUMPS arms
flailing down onto the ground in the direction of the
camera

It lands on its STOMACH then scrambles up to its hands and
knees

The camera jiggles backing up quickly The ZOMBIE regains
its footing and sprints spastically aggressively toward the
lens

The CAMERAMAN has seen enough He turns and RUNS his POV
bouncing wildly Then the camera WHIP-PANS to face the
Zombie as it WAILS and ATTACKS

The zombie engulfs the screen TACKLING the Cameraman

The camera FALLS to the ground askew shooting nothing but
treetops and sky Offscreen the CAMERAMAN SCREAMS and
SCREAMS and SCREAMS accompanied by ripping cracking
CRUNCHING
Something just God-awful is happening to this guy Then he
gacks and falls SILENT

We hear munching

The zombie’s superbly frightening FACE comes into frame
again at an angle staring into the camera lens as though
it’s a bathroom mirror The zombie curiously looks at its
reflection twitching trembling smacking its lips

The zombie BELCHES long loud and animal-like FOGGING the
LENS with its breath

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
OK that was pretty unnecessary Welcome
to Zombieland This land was made for
you and me

DISSOLVE TO
A GLOBE SLOWLY TURNING CLOCKWISE

It looks like a normal globe for a bit all the familiar
oceans continents only instead of names for countries
one big word stretches all the way across the equator
applying to everything on earth

ZOMBIELAND

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Zombieland is like a greatest hits
collection of nightmares where the only
ones they forgot to include are the one
where youre naked and the one where you
havent studied for your final exam
Casualty rates have been astronomical
I’m one of the few non-zombies left And
that’s only thanks to a little list I
call ‘The Forty-Seven Rules for Surviving
Zombieland’

SMASH CUT TO

EXT FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

BAM A GUY is sprinting like mad toward a high school
football field BOOM A truly frightening snarling male
ZOMBIE is right on his heels sprinting after him

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Rule 1 - Cardio
Superimposed onscreen A TITLE 1 Cardio

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Pretty self-explanatory um do a lot
of cardio Therell be times when you
have to run for your life Literally
So get in shape

The GUY is still running but every breath is now searingly
painful His body is obviously SHUTTING DOWN on him

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Zombies lead a very active lifestyle

The ZOMBIE by contrast is breathing nicely

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
So should you

A wide master shot (a la a football broadcast) of the GUY
running down the football field like a running back and the
zombie like a linebacker DRAGGING him down from behind

INT CAFETERIA - NIGHT

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Rule 2 - Zip-Loc Bags

A MAN sits alone in a school CAFETERIA at night eating from
a big jar of pickles

Superimposed onscreen A TITLE 2 JZip-Loc Bags

Suddenly the fluorescent ceiling lights SHORT-CIRCUIT
SPARK and go OUT plunging the room into darkness The man
is illuminated only by a sliver of MOONLIGHT from a nearby
WINDOW

The man stands up and pulls a FLASHLIGHT from his backpack

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Always pack wisely This should go
without saying but youd be surprised
Ima big fan of Zip-Loc bags Youve
got enough problems moisture shouldnt
be one of them

The man flicks the switch on the flashlight but it doesn’t
turn on He empties the D-BATTERIES onto his palm to
discover that they’ve CORRODED
The man stares into the darkness with a concerned look
gathers his courage then takes a step forward out of the
moonbeam and into the dark

and is yanked the rest of the way and EVISCERATED
EXT CITY STREET - DAY

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Rule 3 - Double Tap

A WOMAN stands on a city street steely-eyed resolute
holding a pistol with two hands We hear rapid FOOTFALLS
approaching her

Superimposed onscreen A TITLE 3 Double Tap

The footsteps belong to a big female ZOMBIE who RUSHES
straight AT the woman The woman PLUGS the zombie in the
chest with a bullet The zombie FACE-PLANTS and lies
motionless

Gun still raised the woman approaches the zombie to test
with her foot whether it’s dead

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Youve just shot a zombie You think
its dead youre trying to save
bullets unh-uh Two more shots One
to the head makes ninety-nine percent
sure One more to the head makes a
hundred Its known as a Double Tap

The woman doesn’t follow Flagstaff’s advice She NUDGES the
zombie’s leg It keeps its eyes CLOSED like a little girl
whos pretending to be asleep when her parents arrive home
after a night out

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Theres no use saving for the next zombie
when this ones about to

The woman turns away and the zombie slyly PEEKS at her It
LUNGES and BITES VICIOUSLY into her ACHILLES TENDON

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
---give you a season-ending injury

INTEXT CARSTREET - DAY

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Rule 4 - Seatbelts
A panicky WOMAN turns the ignition in her CAR and SLAMS it
into gear She does not however put on her SEATBELT

Superimposed onscreen A TITLE 4 Seatbelts

The woman swings her car in a wide arc CLIPPING one ZOMBIE
and narrowly avoiding ANOTHER

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Look I know youre in a rush But it
only takes two seconds Call me a goody-
two-shoes but if youre in this much of
a hurry chances are youre about to get
in a wreck

No sooner does Flagstaff say this than the woman pulls in
front of an oncoming TRUCK Her car is SMACKED in the side

The woman is THROWN through the side window of her car and
lands on the asphalt deader than dead

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
The pavement facial Slightly worse than
being a goody-two-shoes Same ballpark
But slightly worse

EXT GAS STATION - OUTSIDE MEN’S ROOM - DAY

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
OK lets put these rules together That
guy there is me probably about what a
month after the zombie disease took off
Im in West Covina California It may
look like zombies destroyed it
Actually that’s just West Covina

FLAGSTAFF a pale unshaven borderline good-looking NERD is
standing outside a gas station men’s room in West Covina
California the arm-pit of the Golden State

Flagstaff holds a SHOTGUN He’s trying to decide whether to
open the door God knows what’s in there

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Ive just filled up at a strange gas
station Ive gotta go number two If
caring too much about hygiene is an
offense then Im a smooth criminal I
enjoy a clean place to go number two
Im considering opening that bathroom
door Notice what a huge wuss I am
Seriously I don’t have the guts God gave
one of those trembly toy poodles the
kind that pees on eye contact But Ive
survived so far ‘cause I play it safe
Always by the rules My rules

As Flagstaff navigates his way through the following action
scene he follows ALL FOUR of rules 1-4 And what he just
said is the truth we aren’t watching a hero here

we’re watching a COWARD

Flagstaff reaches for the bathroom DOOR then stops thinks
and decides AGAINST it He backs away slowly to discover he
made the RIGHT CALL A male ZOMBIE BURSTS out the door
SCREECHING horribly

Flagstaff FLINCHES and fires the shotgun wildly missing
Instead of fighting he turns and RUNS The ZOMBIE CHASES
HIM the end of a roll of TOILET PAPER stuck to its SHOE
The roll trails out behind as it runs

Flagstaff runs around the corner toward his SAAB only to
discover a FEMALE ZOMBIE in between him and the car It
SCREAMS and beelines for him

He FIRES at the new zombie but only hits it in the ARM The
shotgun pops open its two chambers empty of shells Rather
than fight hand-to-hand Flagstaff makes a wide-eyed DASH for
an adjoining dirt FIELD

We’re with Flagstaff as he runs through the field the two
zombies close behind His lungs are in good shape The
zombies aren’t gaining (The title 1 Cardio reappears)

A HIGH WIDE SHOT reveals Flagstaff beginning to PULL AWAY
from the ZOMBIES as he leads them in a big circle back toward
the station and his car

Flagstaff runs up to the car pulls out his KEYS then
spastically DROPS THEM as he’s going to put them in the lock

FLAGSTAFF
Shit

Flagstaff almost reaches down but the zombies are catching
back up again A wise decision Flagstaff runs again for
the FIELD

We’re back watching the HIGH WIDE SHOT It’s comically
exactly the same as the last one with Flagstaff buying some
time pulling away from the ZOMBIES as he leads them in the
big circle (The title 1 Cardio reappears BLINKING ON
AND OFF FOR EMPHASIS)
This time Flagstaff reaches the car successfully picks up
his keys goes to put them in the lock and then NOTICES that
the car wasn’t even locked anyway He rolls his eyes opens
the door JUMPS inside closes the door and SHOVES the keys
into the ignition stopping only to

FASTEN his SEATBELT

Flagstaff FLOORS the car FISHTAILING putting distance
between himself and the ZOMBIES speeding down the street
When all is clear he takes a huge sigh of relief

The zombies give up the chase as Flagstaff’s Saab disappears

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
And now were about to be reminded why I
was such a moron for forgetting to lock
my car

Flagstaff goes to adjust his REAR-VIEW MIRROR and in it
sees a ZOMBIE SIT UP in the BACK SEAT a big bloody grin on
its face

Flagstaff SCREAMS SLAMS on the brakes swerves and BASHES
into a SAGUARO CACTUS which is decorating a man’s lawn

The ZOMBIE launches from the back seat of the car SMASHES
through the windshield THUMPS its head against the cactus
and ends up SPRAWLED on the hood

Flagstaff by contrast is SAVED by his SEATBELT which TUGS
hard against his chest (Title 4 Seatbelts)

Suddenly the ZOMBIE a PIECE of CACTUS stuck in its
forehead spins around on the hood and tries to get back
through the hole in the cracked windshield

The WINDSHIELD WIPERS and WINDSHIELD CLEANING MIST are going
off indiscriminately spraying the zombie in the face and
tapping it on the head

In the front seat a terrified Flagstaff hurriedly pops open
his SHOTGUN and grabs a ZIP-LOC BAG (Title 2 Zip-Loc Bags)
off the floor next to him It’s wet on the outside from the
windshield fluid but nice and DRY on the inside and full of
SHOTGUN SHELLS

Flagstaff loads a dry shell into his shotgun aims and
SHOOTS the zombie off the hood of the car

Without pause he pops the Shotgun open loads TWO MORE
SHELLS inside climbs out and STANDS OVER the fallen ZOMBIE
Flagstaff closes one eye and AIMS at the head (Title 3
Double Tap) KA-BLAM KA-BLAM Silence

Physically and emotionally spent Flagstaff leans back
against his car and SLIDES to the ground He sniffs the air
looks down and gets a forlorn expression on his face

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
On the bright side Id found a place to
go number two

FADE OUT

We hear the first notes of PATSY CLINE’S classic BALLAD ‘I
FALL TO PIECES’

FADE UP ON

A MONTAGE of people succumbing to zombies as the world comes
to an end and the American Dream is lost

EXTINT STREET CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

A MAN on a street scratches off a LOTTERY TICKET He WHOOPS
and JUMPS when he sees three CHERRIES

The man sprints inside a CONVENIENCE STORE with his ticket
No one is behind the counter He frowns and peers behind it
Without warning a snarling ZOMBIE dressed in a vest JUMPS
UP from behind the counter and YANKS the man over it

EXT PARK — DAY

A homemade BANNER over an idyllic children’s PARK reads
‘FATHER SON SCOUT PICNIC’ A FATHER and his eight-year-old
SON dressed in SCOUT UNIFORMS run awkwardly toward camera
Their LEGS are BOUND TOGETHER as part of a THREE-LEGGED RACE

LURCHING after them are FOUR MORE FATHER-SON scout pairs
also tied at the leg but foaming at the mouth These four
pairs aren’t trying to beat the first place team they’re
trying to EAT the first place team

INT MALL PHOTO BOOTH - NIGHT

Two young LOVERS at the MALL enter one of those gimmicky FOUR-
PHOTO booths sit down and pull the curtain A HUNGRY

ZOMBIE sneaks up THROWS BACK THE CURTAIN and DIVES INSIDE
The booth SHAKES with the attack then falls silent

A FOUR-PHOTO STRIP emerges into the pick-up slot In the
first photo the couple is LAUGHING

In the second they’re REACTING to the LUNGING zombie in
third they’re FIGHTING the zombie and in the FOURTH the
bloody-mouthed zombie is looking happily into camera as if
it remembers how to pose

EXT SANTA MONICA PIER - DAY

A FAMILY of FOUR sits in a seat at the top of a FERRIS WHEEL
stranded by a clamoring CROWD of ZOMBIES below They take
each other’s hands and squeeze their palms tightly forlornly
together

FADE OUT
FADE UP ON
EXT NEIGHBORHOOD - WEST COVINA CALIFORNIA - DAY

Flagstaff’s Saab is still bashed up against the cactus STEAM
pouring from under its hood

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
They say you cant go home again Me
Im trying to prove ‘em wrong making my
way from my LA apartment to the only
place Ive ever felt safe Flagstaff
Arizona On even the slightest chance
Mom and Dad might still be alive

FLAGSTAFF himself has abandoned the car He is walking up
the street everything but his shotgun stuffed into a ROLLING
SUITCASE which he tugs behind him

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Moments like these made me glad glad I
chose that suitcase with the little
rollers I was done being the idiot with
the duffel bag
EXT 10 FREEWAY ON-RAMP WEST COVINA CALIFORNIA - DAY

FLAGSTAFF hikes up the on-ramp onto the freeway shotgun
under one arm suitcase-on-wheels pulled behind

DISSOLVE TO
EXT 10 FREEWAY WEST COVINA CALIFORNIA - LATER

FLAGSTAFF walks from abandoned VEHICLE to abandoned VEHICLE
looking carefully for a new ride Nothing suits his purpose

DISSOLVE TO

EXT 10 FREEWAY WEST COVINA CALIFORNIA - LATER

An exhausted FLAGSTAFF trudges on more slowly now Then as
if by magic he hears the distant rumble of an ENGINE

On the western horizon a black CADILLAC ESCALADE threads its
way through the abandoned freeway traffic heading EAST

On each side and hood of the Escalade written in WHITE SOAP
is the number 3 (in memory of the late great DALE EARNHARDT)

As the ESCALADE approaches a nervous FLAGSTAFF grabs a
TOPPLED MOTORCYCLE props it up on its kickstand kneels
behind it and aims his shotgun warily at the nearing SUV

The Escalade pulls up to within a few yards of the motorcycle
and STOPS The driver’s side door swings open and a square-
jawed broad-shouldered bad ass ALBUQUERQUE steps onto the

running board

Albuquerque is in his mid-thirties He wears ironic thick
librarian-appropriate eyeglasses He stares at the
motorcycle with curiosity

Flagstaff stands up from behind the motorcycle with his
shotgun AIMED at Albuquerque

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Heres the thing about scared people
Theyre great at hiding it Imagine an
apple nice and shiny on the outside a
greedy little worm chewing up the inside
Thats me

Albuquerque raises an eyebrow then shrugs matter-of-factly
as if to say ‘If that’s how you want to do it’

Albuquerque calmly reaches into his car pulls out a no-
shitting-you AK-47 AUTOMATIC RIFLE lifts it to his shoulder
and points it RIGHT BACK AT Flagstaff

lagstaff’s eyes widen Uh-oh Albuquerque’s finger goes
rom the trigger guard to the TRIGGER

ee

Flagstaff quickly wipes sweat from his temple with his
sleeve starts to tremble then all at once GIVES UP
lowering his shotgun setting it against the motorcycle and
RAISING HIS HANDS ashamed

Flagstaff smiles embarrassedly then STICKS OUT ONE THUMB
questioningly in the universal signal of HITCH-HIKING

Albuquerque rolls his eyes lowers his gun and motions to
Flagstaff with his head ‘Get in’

INT CADILLAC ESCALADE - DAY

Inside the SUV ALBUQUERQUE sits behind the wheel FLAGSTAFF
sits in the passenger seat next to him There’s an awkward
silence punctuated by Flagstaff’s careful look OVER HIS
SHOULDER INTO THE BACK SEAT

ALBUQUERQUE
Whatcha looking for

FLAGSTAFF

Flagstaff loses the face Albuquerque turns on the ignition

FLAGSTAFF

ALBUQUERQUE
Clench and hold

The Escalade’s tires CRUNCH the gravel as it pulls away
FLAGSTAFF (VO)

If I was stupid enough to hitch-hike

might as well have been with Albuquerque

Turns out don’t let the glasses fool

you

SMASH CUT TO

EXT CITY STREET - DAY - FLASHBACK
A SONG RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE’S ‘KNOW YOUR ENEMY’
A hungry ZOMBIE SPRINTS toward an office building and

DISAPPEARS around the corner Suddenly we hear a loud
MECHANICAL BUZZING from around that corner
After a beat the SAME ZOMBIE comes SPRINTING back the way it
came with ALBUQUERQUE CHASING it from behind At the
moment he is wearing a welder’s helmet and wielding two
BUZZING CHAINSAWS one in each hand

The zombie hightails it around a building Albuquerque slows
to a stop He SNAPS his head back so that the shield of his
welder’s mask lifts and his FACE is fully revealed

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Albuquerques in the ass-kicking
business And

Albuquerque SMIRKS

ALBUQUERQUE
(to the now-gone zombie)
Business is good

The ‘Rage’ song fades

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Dont get the wrong impression
Albuquerques got a soft side Look a
month before the zombies showed up

INT KITCHEN - DAY - FLASHBACK

ALBUQUERQUE is in a modest KITCHEN pre-Zombieland cooking
ANIMAL-SHAPED PANCAKES (pancakes with mouse ears etc) with
a lot of tender loving care Albuquerque spatulas the
pancakes onto a PLATE and carries it to the kitchen table

We REVERSE ANGLE to see the recipient of the pancakes not a
child but Albuquerque’s DOG BUCK a GERMAN SHEPHERD PUPPY
Buck is sitting ON a chair at the table Albuquerque WATCHES
HAPPILY as Buck gobbles up the pancakes

Next we see ALBUQUERQUE running in and out of frame
carrying Buck up in the air zooming him around like an
AIRPLANE making machine-gunning and dive-bombing noises

At last he falls to the ground with Buck and starts ESKIMO
KISSING him (Buck licks him on the mouth) and blowing
RASPBERRIES on his fuzzy BELLY

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Yeah Thats the grossest thing yet

EXT 10 FREEWAY OUTSIDE QUARTZSITE ARIZONA - DAY - PRESENT

A sign on the 10 freeway reads ‘QUARTZSITE - 89 MI’
FLAGSTAFF and ALBUQUERQUE are driving down the freeway
through a MOUNTAINOUS DESERT PASS when Albuquerque notices a
BROKEN GUARD RAIL and SLOWS to a STOP

CUT TO

FLAGSTAFF and ALBUQUERQUE STANDING over the broken guard
rail each holding a SHOTGUN There is an overturned HOSTESS
DELIVERY TRUCK at the bottom of a GORGE

FLAGSTAFF
That’s a Hostess truck

ALBUQUERQUE
New plan I could use a Twinkie
(laces up his boot)
Coming

Flagstaff BLINKS Does he really have to

FLAGSTAFF
Hold on

Flagstaff starts doing some old-fashioned old-man TORSO
TWISTS ANKLE TOUCHES and DEEP KNEE BENDS He looks like
one of those ridiculous yesteryear bodybuilders

ALBUQUERQUE
(watches )
Youre serious

FLAGSTAFF
Stretching’s important You should
stretch

ALBUQUERQUE

Don’t believe in it
Albuquerque starts down the gorge WITHOUT Flagstaff
ALBUQUERQUE
You never see a lion stretch before it
kills a gazelle
Flagstaff furrows his brow An interesting point

EXT HOSTESS TRUCK - DAY

FLAGSTAFF and ALBUQUERQUE carefully approach the overturned
Hostess truck The back delivery door is slightly AJAR

Albuquerque and Flagstaff RAISE their GUNS Flagstaff bites
his lip Albuquerque slowly REACHES for the door handle
Ominous violins swell

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Whatevers inside an overturned Hostess
truck it cant be good for your health

All at once Albuquerque THROWS BACK the door and an
AVALANCHE of BOXES of SNO-BALLS (those white coconut-covered
PUFFS) POURS out onto the ground Nothing more dangerous
than that

The music dies Flagstaff SIGHS with relief Albuquerque
however isn’t nearly so happy

There’s not a TWINKIE in sight

ALBUQUERQUE
What self-respecting Hostess truck is
full of two thousand boxes of Sno-Balls

FLAGSTAFF
I like Sno-Balls

ALBUQUERQUE
Coconut’s gross Not the taste The
consistency

Flagstaff opens a package and starts CHOWING DOWN on a Sno-
Ball A perturbed Albuquerque STARES Flagstaff stops
chewing and gives a guilty shrug as if to say ‘What’

Albuquerque heads back UP the steep slope

ALBUQUERQUE
This Twinkie thing Not over yet

FLAGSTAFF
Um This may be a bad time But I gotta
take the Browns to the Superbowl

ALBUQUERQUE
Really

FLAGSTAFF
Really

INT MEN’S ROOM - DAY

We’re now inside the restroom FLAGSTAFF has just entered
holding his shotgun

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
I know I know again so soon What
can I say A case of chronic anxiety
Ever since I was born Ive been ruled by
irrational fears

Flagstaff nudges each stall door open with his foot his
nervousness plain to see

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Theres nothing I couldnt find a reason
to be afraid of Things like
Department Store Santas quicksand

EXT REST AREA - MEN’S ROOM - DAY
FLAGSTAFF emerges from the restroom to join ALBUQUERQUE

FLAGSTAFF
(smiles)
My work here is done

As Flagstaff and Albuquerque walk away we hear a growing
CACOPHONOUS SOUND (TRAFFIC HORNS HONKING THE DIN OF PEOPLE
TALKING ETC) and we SMASH CUT TO

AN INSERT A SATELLITE PHOTO OF THE PLANET EARTH THE
CAMERA PUSHES IN ROTATING WE HEAR THE GRIDLOCK OF THE
POPULATION BELOW TRAFFIC HORNS PEOPLE ETC

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Nowadays Im always wishing life could
go back to ‘normal’ Which is weird
‘Cause life was never really ‘normal’ for
me Long before there were ever zombies
Phobias started boxing me in I avoided
more and more things My world got
smaller

We ZOOM IN instantly The PHOTO is now only of one CITY its
streets forming a grid The traffic noise subsides a little

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
---and smaller

We ZOOM IN AGAIN The PHOTO is now only of one NEIGHBORHOOD
The traffic noise subsides again

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Superimposed onscreen A TITLE Then one Friday night

FLAGSTAFF is at his computer lit by the pale glow of the
screen one hand under his waistband His desk is a mess
Soda-can forest Star Trek Voyager DVDs Sticky keyboard

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Friday night third straight week
indoors Leaning Tower of Pizza Boxes
Code Red Mountain Dew Jessica Alba
mouse pad World of Warcraft Right
hand on Jessica Left hand in pants
Pride - nowhere Dignity - loooong gone
Virginity - totally justifiable to
speculate on

His hands OCCUPIED Flagstaff tries to take a DRINK from his
Code Red Mountain Dew cup by BITING the lip of it and TIPPING
it back into his mouth The Mountain Dew SPILLS all down his
chin and the front of his shirt

FLAGSTAFF
Smooth

An annoyed Flagstaff marches into the bathroom dripping
Mountain Dew He bends over the faucet and gets the shirt as
wet as can be to try to take out the stain

At last he gives up takes off the shirt and DROPS it on
the bathroom FLOOR

Flagstaff ducks into his closet to CHANGE shirts

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
My whole life all Id ever really wanted
was to find a girl Fall in love Bring
her home to meet the folks That was my
biggest fear of all Dying alone Mom
didnt know where I would meet a quote
‘marriageable woman’ but Dad knew where
I wouldnt my locked apartment And
hed always been right ‘Til now

Just as Flagstaff is heading back to his computer he hears
POUNDING at his front door He nearly jumps a foot in the
air then freezes listening

The pounding stops for a second then starts again LOUDER
Flagstaff TIPTOES down the hall and approaches his front door
as if it were the edge of the Grand Canyon

FEMALE VOICE
(muffled distressed)
408 you in there Please

Flagstaff looks gingerly through the peep hole

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Omigod My adorable next door neighbor
406 Id dreamed of this girl But Id
never said hi ‘cause I was busy making
ground-breaking advances in the exciting
new field of lame

FEMALE VOICE
(now crying)
Please it’s an emergency No one’s
answering Please

Flagstaff is clearly TORN He goes to open the door Then
CHICKENS OUT Then listens to more resigned CRYING

FEMALE VOICE
Heeeelp

Flagstaff finally can’t take it any more his heartstrings
sufficiently tugged He chokes down his fear and very
daintily opens the latch and turns the KNOB

406 BURSTS into the room SLAMS the door behind her bolts
the latch then HUGS Flagstaff like a long-lost relative

She is cuter than a button Tough Feisty The kind of
girl youd love to spend Armageddon with

(dispensing cheek pecks)
Thank you thank you thank you

This showering of thanks can’t help but make Flagstaff feel
good about himself He puts on faux confidence

FLAGSTAFF
It was nothing
INT LIVING ROOM - LATER
FLAGSTAFF takes a seat beside 406 on his living room SOFA
She wears a blanket over her shoulders He offers her a cup

She thankfully takes it in both hands and DRINKS

Mountain Dew

FLAGSTAFF
(nods )

Code Red And some Golden Grahams
(hands her a plastic bag of
Golden Grahams)

The Zip-Loc Bag keeps ‘em crisp

Hm

FLAGSTAFF
Why don’t you start from the beginning

Not ‘til we’ve called the police

FLAGSTAFF
Right sorry

Flagstaff is already clutching CORDLESS PHONE He hits the
green ‘talk’ button He doesn’t hear a dial tone Instead
it’s that fast ‘the phone’s been off the hook too long’ TONE

(hearing the tone)
What’s wrong Mine was off too And I
dropped my cell when you got a cell

FLAGSTAFF
(shakes his head an
embarrassing ‘no’)
Probably the last guy in LA Wanna try
down the hall

In a bit Right now I feel safe Here
FLAGSTAFF

Great

He was homeless And sick I was
walking home from a bar talking on the
phone And this homeless guy came
sprinting toward me Not running
Sprinting I thought he was like
running after someone or from someone
‘til ‘til

Her hands are shaking

FLAGSTAFF
Here
Flagstaff sets down her Mountain Dew and takes her hands
BETWEEN his own warming and stilling them

(smiles through tears)
Thanks

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
OK the confidence Coming out of
nowhere seriously maybe even my ass

FLAGSTAFF
Go on

He ran right for me Just totally wild
Violent He grabbed me And I dropped
my phone and pulled away And ran So

made it inside the gate Last I saw he
was still out there going crazy

FLAGSTAFF
Drugs maybe Bad trip

I guess
FLAGSTAFF

He’ll just need time to come down We’1l
stay here ‘til the phones come back on
Then well call the police

I didn’t mention the worst part
FLAGSTAFF

Yeah

He tried to bite me
A BEAT while Flagstaff stares grossed out

FLAGSTAFF
Youre right That’s the worst part

Sorry I’m so scared

FLAGSTAFF
Quit it Some homeless guy tries to eat
you
That’s like the right kind of scared
reasonable scared Me I get scared of
stuff like ventriloquist dummies and
those rags they use to wipe restaurant
tables

Really

FLAGSTAFF
I joke a lot The point is I’m here for
you And as long as you’re by my side
I’m not leaving this apartment

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Playing to my strengths

(sincere smile)
Mind if I close my eyes

406 KISSES Flagstaff on the forehead then pulls the blanket
to her chin leans back and closes her eyes Flagstaff can
barely contain his jittery EXCITEMENT

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Set aside the feverish homeless
cannibal Im living the dream Id
always my whole life wanted to
brush a girls hair over her ear

Flagstaff reaches out with his hand and brushes 406’s hair
over her ear She opens her eyes and smiles then nestles
back against the sofa cushion

Night

FLAGSTAFF
Night

Mountain Dew non-withstanding sleepiness is contagious
Flagstaff watches 406 breathe peacefully for a few moments
then props up a sofa pillow and closes his eyes HIMSELF
FADE OUT
FADE UP ON
INT APARTMENT - HOURS LATER

FLAGSTAFF has been sound asleep for who knows how long He’s
sitting up on the couch mouth open head tilted to the left

We’re on his FACE as he stirs His eyelids flutter He
twitches then opens his eyes shaking off sleep

Where is he Oh right on the couch His kitchen is on the
left And 406 must still be on the couch

Flagstaff turns to the right expecting to find 406 asleep
next to him Instead

-SHE IS SITTING A FOOT FROM HIS FACE HER FACE A BLOODY
BLACK MESS OF ZOMBIE DISEASE YELLOW EYES ALIVE WITH
CURIOSITY AND MALICE GRINNING AT HIM

FLAGSTAFF
Ghaaaaa

FLAGSTAFF leaps BACKWARD off the couch to get away from the
ZOMBIEFIED 406

FLAGSTAFF
Oh my God Are you alright

406 stays where she is SNIFFS the air longingly and opens
her mouth as if to say something Instead she HISSESHOCKS
UP PHLEGM and then SPRINGS at Flagstaff with ABANDON

FLAGSTAFF
Ahhh

Flagstaff backs up as fast as humanly possible then turns to
run He SPRINTS MADLY into his tiny dining room with 406
right on his heels Flagstaff overturns two DINING CHAIRS
behind him to try to slow 406 She gets TANGLED and SLIPS

406 gets to her feet and lurches into the KITCHEN Flagstaff
has turned to face her holding a BLENDER over his head

FLAGSTAFF
Stay back I don’t wanna hurt you

Zombies don’t generally stay back She BUM-RUSHES him
Still wigged out by the idea of injuring his neighbor
(however zombie-ish) Flagstaff DITCHES the blender and RUNS

406 is right behind him when he reaches the BEDROOM and tries
to SLAM the door SHUT She STICKS OUT her foot as if she’s
about to slide into third base and tries to STOP it

The door SMASHES 406’s ANKLE bending her foot SIDEWAYS with
a sickening CRACK She falls to the ground screaming in a
daze clutching her now diagonally attached foot

FLAGSTAFF
Shit Sorry

But nice as he may be Flagstaff doesn’t waste a moment he
tries to SLAM the door shut again 406 LUNGES and gets her
ARMS and SHOULDERS through

This time the door has no chance whatsoever of closing The
broken ankle has HOBBLED her but she’s still coming

Flagstaff can’t retreat anywhere but the closet or the
bathroom He chooses the BATHROOM dashing reaching it

Unfortunately he SLIPS on the WET MOUNTAIN-DEW-COVERED
SHIRT from earlier He CRASHES to the TILE FLOOR pulling
the SHOWER CURTAIN out of its rings to try to break his fall

Now she’s reached his feet biting clawing He KICKS
frantically and haphazardly but she’s got him by the ankle
He opens the CABINET under the sink for a weapon

Kleenex No Cotton Balls No Toilet Paper Not
happening Flagstaff rolls his eyes His arsenal is
exclusively soft and fluffy

406 rises up to jump on Flagstaff and he just manages to
pull the SHOWER CURTAIN over himself She lands on top of
him and now THEY’RE WRESTLING GRABBING PUNCHING with only
the CURTAIN in between them

Flagstaff falls back to the tile WHACKING his HEAD Now he
and the zombie are literally FACE to FACE as if kissing but
with the shower curtain still BETWEEN them

406s bloody features PRESS gruesomely against the PLASTIC
Flagstaff uses the moment to reach up and WRAP the curtain
around the back of her head trying to cut off her AIR

It’s WORKING she gasps wheezes chokes and at last
starts to go LIMP We think it’s about to be OVER

-until she CHEWS through the plastic which allows her to
take a DEEP raspy BREATH Her gangrenous tongue PROTRUDES
through the hole ALMOST LICKING Flagstaff on the mouth

Flagstaff GROPES in the cabinet under the sink again grabs
an aeresol can of LYSOL AIMS it into her mouth and FIRES

406 CHOKES and rolls off Flagstaff He gains his feet SLIPS
back against the TOILET and knocks the PORCELAIN LID on the
back of the toilet basin ASKEW

This gives him an idea He grabs the heavy LID and steps
over 406 SWATTING her hand with it as he runs from the room

Flagstaff SHUTS the bathroom door behind him and the bedroom
door behind him after that Unfortunately he’s on the wrong
side of the locks now so he can’t lock her out of anywhere

We’re now with 406 as she rises to her feet again She
instinctively tries to BEND her broken foot back into place
CRACKING it from one odd angle to another No luck now it’s
just as twisted only in the other direction

406 gives up on her foot and opens the bathroom door Then
she limps to the bedroom door and opens it too Flagstaff
is standing in the living room chest heaving

FLAGSTAFF
Please listen to me 406 Listen If
you’re in there You’re just sick
Stop Don’t

But 406’s expression is one of pure blinded hate She
throws back her head and HOWLS with rage The sound is
beyond scary like that of a trapped infuriated animal

And she RUN-DRAGS herself TOWARD him

FLAGSTAFF
(under his breath)
Forgive me

With all his might he rears back and BELTS her in the head
with the TOILET BASIN LID At the EXACT MOMENT of jarring
IMPACT we FREEZE FRAME

We see a STILL SHOT of Flagstaff connecting perfectly
violently with 406’s temple

WATER Running from the faucet eddying in the sink with
blood and grime splashing on walls and mirror

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
You tell yourself over and over this
this did not just happen It did not
It did not It did not It couldnt
have It couldnt have

INTERCUT we see QUICK IMAGES of FLAGSTAFF’s pain fear and
grief He’s washing his hands feverishly in the sink He’s
nearly HYPERVENTILATING He’s spasming in a near FIT of
panting and groans

He’s sitting still against his bathroom wall and TREMBLING

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
But it did In the face of every sane
thing that came before it and all Id
come to know and expect about the
world it did

DISSOLVE TO

FLAGSTAFF with a phone to his ear still hearing the not-in-
service TONE He sets down the receiver In tears he
carries his SHOWER CURTAIN into the living room

He stands over 406’s dead body chokes back the smell then
starts to wrap her in the SHOWER CURTAIN DUCT-TAPING the
edges As he goes to move her arm something makes him stop

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
A ‘zombie’ isn’t a dead person whos come
back to life Its someone whos been
infected with the plague of the 21st
century - a terrible disease that leaves
its victims irrationally violent and
hateful some insist evil JZombieism is
carried in bodily fluid

Near 406’s wrist is a severe BITE MARK that bears the
unmistakable imprint of human teeth Flagstaff examines the
bite mark his mind racing with the implications

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
These fluids are highly contagious and
fast-acting when they mix with your
fluids So if youre thinking of going
tongue-to-tonsil with your suddenly less-
cute neighbor

A QUICK CUT of 406 trying to stick her TONGUE into
Flagstaff’s mouth through the shower curtain

-try something more innocent

Flagstaff sadly BRUSHES 406’s HAIR over her EAR then RESUMES
wrapping her up

EXT APARTMENT BALCONY - DAY

From across the street we watch in a MASTER SHOT as
FLAGSTAFF struggles to push 406’s shrouded CORPSE over his

EXT GAS STATION - DAY - FLASHBACK

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
For instance heres a little drinking
game Take a look at the following pre-
Zombieland scene and try to predict whos
gonna survive post-Zombieland

We’re outside a PRE-ZOMBIELAND gas station on the outskirts
of a busy city Hustle Bustle Cars whizzing by

Superimposed onscreen A TITLE One month earlier

We crane all the way to the ASPHALT where a well-dressed
put-upon young WOMAN mid-twenties is kneeling down
frantically searching on the ground next to some gas pumps

The woman is GORGEOUS but an emotional wreck Her search is
totally FRUITLESS and she fights back tears

The MANAGER of the gas station a shifty-eyed GREASE-BALL
sees her and comes out to help

MANAGER

WOMAN
My engagement ring I took it off to
pump my gas Thought I put it in my
purse but it must have

WOMAN

MANAGER

WOMAN
Three thousand dollars
(off the manager’s raised
eyebrow sotto voce)
You don’t understand It’s worth more
than my car

The manager steals a furtive glance at the woman’s car a
cute RED BMW CONVERTIBLE He deftly conceals his excitement

MANAGER
(smiles)
I’m not taking your three thousand
dollars But I will take your number

The woman’s face says it all Can she trust him At last

WOMAN
Thank you so much

She gives him her card

disappear then TURNS QUICKLY and SCOURS THE PAVEMENT

He’s sorting the TRASH Nothing A PHONE RINGS inside He
tosses aside a gross BANANA PEEL and jogs into his OFFICE

A BIT LATER The MANAGER is still on the phone in the
office his back turned to the window

beauty of it

He turns around and SPIES an ELEVEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL bending
over something SHINY on the sidewalk The girl is sharp
tomboyish wise beyond her years hair tousled a quick
study

MANAGER

Like LIGHTNING the manager HANGS up and SPRINTS OUTSIDE
The girl is standing up examining a HUGE SPARKLING RING

The girl looks up The manager reaches out with a grin

MANAGER
Thank you I’ve been looking all over

The manager produces the woman’s CARD A long pause while
the girl considers it

But the girl is still RELUCTANT

MANAGER

He turns to LEAVE

MANAGER
(panic setting in)
You can’t sell it if that’s what you’re
thinking A kid like you takes that ring
into a store they’re only gonna ask a
bunch of questions Besides a big
store it’s not worth anything to them

The girl turns back

GIRL
It is to you

The manager stares daggers into the kid He’s at the END of
his ROPE

INT GAS STATION OFFICE - DAY

The MANAGER is standing at the CASH REGISTER COUNTING OFF
TWENTY dollar BILLS into the GIRL’s HAND

Forty sixty eighty four hundred
That’s four hundred dollars The whole

He tilts the register tray toward the girl to show her that
it’s empty The girl TILTS the tray in the OTHER DIRECTION
revealing another stack of TWENTIES UNDER THE TRAY

The manager sags scoops them up and hands them over

MANAGER

look at the RING The manager was pretty quick to hand out

Another TITLE Double Coupon Sunday

FLAGSTAFF and ALBUQUERQUE are standing by the open tailgate
of the Escalade where Albuquerque gathers some EQUIPMENT

He grabs a pair of wicked-looking HEDGE CLIPPERS He snags
an aluminum BASEBALL BAT and slides two DOUGHNUT SHAPED
WEIGHTS onto the end And he takes out an ACOUSTIC GUITAR
and slides it over his shoulder by the strap

Flagstaff watches bemused then looks up at the store

FLAGSTAFF
I used to love grocery shopping

ALBUQUERQUE
No one loved grocery shopping

Albuquerque SLAMS the tailgate SHUT with a flourish and
marches toward the front doors Flagstaff in tow

ALBUQUERQUE

thing Total myth

They’ll eat anything I know ‘cause I’ve
seen ‘em eat tofu black licorice and

INT GROCERY STORE - DAY

We’re now inside the grocery store where ALBUQUERQUE strides
toward the aisles FLAGSTAFF slinks behind holding his
SHOTGUN The place is a MESS food strewn everywhere

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
When Albuquerque goes Hulk on a zombie
he sets the standard for not-to-be-fucked-
with Intensely violent Creatively
violent No fear Like hes got nothing
to lose I wish I didn’t feel such a
rush watching it but what can I say
Its like art

As if on cue a hugely OBESE ZOMBIE jumps out from behind a
counter Albuquerque unslings the GUITAR spins and BRAINS
the zombie with it

Then Albuquerque makes like a member of The Clash RAISING
the guitar over his head and bringing it down on the zombie
again and again

Suddenly a second MORBIDLY OBESE ZOMBIE rushes on This
time Albuquerque readies the baseball bat with the doughnut
weights He cocks and swings like Alex Rodriguez CRUSHING
its head into a display of snacks

At last one final FAT ZOMBIE waddles toward Albuquerque He
faces it with a smile holding up the big HEDGE CLIPPERS He
SNAPS them a couple times The zombie PAUSES concerned

CUT TO
The NOW-BLOODY HEDGE CLIPPERS sliding across the floor
tossed aside FLAGSTAFF’s mouth is open He’s half amazed
half nauseated
Albuquerque looks at the three HUGELY FAT DEAD ZOMBIES

ALBUQUERQUE
These three really let themselves go

FLAGSTAFF
Being a zombie is depressing And what
cures depression Dessert food

Albuquerque’s EYES WIDEN as he considers this All at once
he DASHES into the DESSERT FOOD AISLE

A couple beats Albuquerque walks out slowly angrily
discarding a couple EMPTY TWINKIE BOXES To add insult to
injury he strolls into the FREEZER AISLE looks then plucks
out a PACKAGE He walks over and hands it to FLAGSTAFF

A PRISTINE BOX of Lean Cusine’s TERIYAKI CHICKEN

ALBUQUERQUE
(sighs)
Got a quarter I wanna ride the rocket
ship

FLAGSTAFF
Which leaves me the pony

Albuquerque is nearly out the door when he suddenly STOPS
He motions for Flagstaff to be still

ALBUQUERQUE
Hear that

We hear the sound of MOVEMENT in an aisle Flagstaff RAISES
his SHOTGUN Slowly Albuquerque and Flagstaff inch around
the corner of the aisle to see what’s making the noise

STANDING in the aisle is the WOMAN of FLAGSTAFF’s DREAMS
twenty-something bedraggled but naturally GORGEOUS who
also just happens to be

-THE CON-WOMAN FROM THE RED BMW

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
All I could think all I could think was
what are the odds another ‘marriageable
woman’ to bring home to the folks
Zombielands like eharmony only fewer
gruesome surprises Someones ears in
danger of having hair brushed over it

But Flagstaff’s excited expectant expression fades as the
woman’s face contorts into ANGUISH and TERROR

Come quick

The woman turns toward the back of the store Albuquerque
and Flagstaff share an anxious look

Stillwater

WICHITA is the woman from the red BMW And yes STILLWATER
is her 11-year-old sister JZombieland has clearly taken its
toll on these two but they’re still alive which is all that
counts

Stillwater sits languidly against a counter She looks pale
sweaty Flagstaff shakes Wichita’s hand then Stillwater’s
As he shakes with Stillwater his eyes dart to a bloody
mouth-shaped WOUND on her WRIST Stillwater closes then
OPENS her eyes

STILLWATER
You did all this for a Twinkie

FLAGSTAFF
He did actually I’m more of a
second banana

Wichita pulls Albuquerque and Flagstaff aside The three
talk in hushed tones
FLAGSTAFF
She doesn’t have long

WICHITA
I know
(gathers her composure)
And she knows We’re just looking for a
way out

Wichita’s eyes go to Flagstaff’s SHOTGUN Flagstaff’s
follows her gaze then SHAKES his HEAD

FLAGSTAFF
Oh no you don’t She’s just a girl

STILLWATER
Don’t talk about me like I’m not here

FLAGSTAFF
(crosses to Stillwater)
I know you’re sick but she wants me
to

STILLWATER
It’s not her decision It’s mine I
made her promise I made her promise
We already said goodbye But we didn’t
have a gun

FLAGSTAFF
This may sound crazy but we’re still not
sure there’s no cure You never know

STILLWATER
You’re just gutless Give him the gun

She motions toward ALBUQUERQUE who’s currently lost in the
ethical dilemma of the moment But he hears Stillwater’s
wish After a few beats he strides over and GRABS HOLD of
the shotgun Flagstaff RESISTS but he YANKS it away

Flagstaff turns his back DISGUSTED as Albuquerque steps
tentatively toward Stillwater Wichita bites her lip

WICHITA
Wait

Wichita holds out her hand

WICHITA
I‘1l do it

44

Albuquerque hesitates then HANDS the SHOTGUN to Wichita
She musters her poise and walks over to her sister

Stillwater and Wichita share a poignant glance then take
each other’s hand Wichita squeezes Stillwater’s palm She
checks the gun for shells (they’re there) then closes it

ALBUQUERQUE
Is there anything we can do

WICHITA
Since you mention it

Wichita turns the SHOTGUN AWAY from Stillwater and POINTS IT
RIGHT AT Albuquerque

WICHITA
-we’ll take your car keys weapons
ammunition

Stillwater POPS OFF the floor with a burst of energy and a
SMIRK

STILLWATER
--and if you’ve got it sugarless gum

Flagstaff turns around What the hell Albuquerque
swallows his surprise He points to Stillwater’s ‘bite’

ALBUQUERQUE
What’s that

STILLWATER
(As in ‘You’re such a dummy
anyone in there’)
Hello
(gestures to the room in which
they’re standing)

Stillwater RUBS OFF the COW BLOOD There’s no wound at all
Flagstaff looks stunned

FLAGSTAFF
Why would you do this

WICHITA
(taking ammo from Flagstaff)
Better you make the mistake of trusting
us Than us make the mistake of trusting
you

EXTINT 10 FREEWAYESCALADE - DAY

WICHITA drives Albuquerque’s ESCALADE west down the freeway
STILLWATER sits in the passenger seat

Wichita flips down the visor and looks in the vanity mirror
She WINCES at her close-up appearance immediately flipping
the visor back up

WICHITA
Avoid the vanity mirror

STILLWATER
Relax I just passed for a zombie

Stillwater flips down her own mirror and frowns

STILLWATER
I’m having a bad hair month

WICHITA

If there were an Olympics for greasy

Stillwater smiles too But the smile fades Wichita tries
to drum up a little spirit

WICHITA
Remind me what we heard about the Magic
Kingdom

STILLWATER

Zombie-free

WICHITA
Good enough for me

Wichita plants the accelerator on the floor

EXT LELAND ARIZONA - DAY

ALBUQUERQUE and FLAGSTAFF are trolling through Leland
looking for a replacement for the ESCALADE Flagstaff is
carrying Albuquerque’s DUFFEL BAG ON TOP of his ROLLING
SUITCASE like a Sherpa

FLAGSTAFF
What I’m gonna miss most

ALBUQUERQUE
Uh-huh

FLAGSTAFF
Sure

Albuquerque STARES impatiently at Flagstaff

FLAGSTAFF
The twenty-inch wheels Followed by the
bucket seats With the lumbar
(looks at Albuquerque)
And the rich premium audio Is
this really helping

ALBUQUERQUE
Do what you want to a guy But do not
fuck with his Cadillac

FLAGSTAFF
(points)
There’s a nice minivan

ALBUQUERQUE
(brightens)
Yeah nice

Albuquerque approaches the MINIVAN in question pauses for
effect and then KICKS the LIVING SHIT out of it SMASHES in
the door panel RIPS off the side-view mirror JUMPS up and
down on the HOOD Then falls right back INTO STEP with
Flagstaff who has kept on walking

A few beats pass Then

ALBUQUERQUE
I pulled something

FLAGSTAFF
Stretch

ALBUQUERQUE
Are the two of us smart enough to come up
with a con like that

Flagstaff eyes Albuquerque and HESITATES

ALBUQUERQUE
Oh man You hesitated
(SEES something in the
DISTANCE pauses)
Question Is it better to be smart
Or lucky

Albuquerque breaks into a SPRINT Flagstaff FOLLOWS

EXT HUMMER H2 - DAY

FLAGSTAFF finishes his jog where he finds ALBUQUERQUE
already circling his new DISCOVERY

a brand spanking new HUMMER H2 in BLACK parked askew in
some guy’s driveway smacked into a wooden garage support
Albuquerque throws open the driver’s door and finds a KEY in
the ignition He turns it and the Hummer ROARS to LIFE

Albuquerque CACKLES Flagstaff opens the passenger door and
dutifully cautiously peers into the BACK SEAT

Superimposed onscreen A TITLE 31 Check the Back Seat

Sitting on the back seat is a BIG paramilitary-style CANVAS
BAG Flagstaff examines the bag You don’t think He
looks up at the house which has a Confederate flag flying
Flagstaff slowly pulls back the zipper to discover an ARRAY
of WICKED-LOOKING PARAMILITARY WEAPONRY

Flagstaff gently CLEARS his THROAT to get Albuquerques
attention Albuquerque turns and looks into the bag

ALBUQUERQUE
No Way

Twin 50 Caliber DESERT EAGLE PISTOLS Two COMBAT SHOTGUNS
BOXES of AMMUNITION And the crowning glory an absolutely
pristine deadly monstrous STEYR AUG AUTOMATIC RIFLE

Albuquerque is a twelve-year-old boy again

ALBUQUERQUE
This is a really big truck
(deep breath)
And these are really big guns
Flagstaff claps him on the shoulder

FLAGSTAFF
Take your time

INT HUMMER H2 - DAY

FLAGSTAFF sits patiently in the passenger seat of the Hummer
YAWNING Visible behind Flagstaff in the rear window (out of
focus due to the long lens and muffled because he’s outside
the closed truck) is ALBUQUERQUE who fires a BURST with the
automatic rifle to test it then starts whooping like an
idiot dancing and punching the air in CELEBRATION (inspired
by a famous shot from ‘Ferris Bueller’s Day Off’)

At last Albuquerque opens the driver’s door and HOPS in

FLAGSTAFF
Done

ALBUQUERQUE
Maayybe

Albuquerque FLOORS the Hummer splintering the rest of the
garage support and bouncing onto the street

EXTINT 10 FREEWAYHUMMER - DAY

Back in the Hummer ALBUQUERQUE continues his story

ALBUQUERQUE
There’s no getting him back So I’m
looking for a new home And by home I
don’t mean Mom’s tuna surprise or some
bullshit place with no zombies I mean
something anything that makes me
feel one one-thousandth of the way I did
around Buck Tomorrow maybe that’s
skinny-dipping in the Yellowstone
River the next day maybe swinging
from the chandeliers in the Lincoln
Bedroom But today A Vortec 6 liter V-
8 A boxful of 50 cal And lord
willing a GD twinkie Gotta enjoy the
little things

Albuquerque turns on the CD player A SONG begins BILLY
JOELS ‘KEEPING THE FAITH’ There is no better music for
feeling good when you should otherwise be feeling bad

Albuquerque sticks his HEAD out the SUN ROOF singing into
the wind

ALBUQUERQUE
Gonna listen to my forty-fives Ain’t it
wonderful to be alive when the rock-n-
roll plays

Albuquerque inadvertently catches a BUG in the MOUTH He
HACKS Flagstaff pulls out a tiny NOTEBOOK and WRITES in it

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
I hate to give credit to anyone who eats
bugs But Im even writing it down

ALBUQUERQUE
You know what happened to the Escalade

DETROIT (VO)

marker two-ten ‘Check Engine’ light on
I was worried But you found a new ride

Albuquerque and Flagstaff share a look

ALBUQUERQUE

Albuquerque hits the GAS He is practically salivating The
Hummer turns onto the 10 FREEWAY headed WEST FLAGSTAFF
fidgets in his seat UNCOMFORTABLY
FLAGSTAFF
They say ‘He who seeks revenge should
remember to dig two graves’
ALBUQUERQUE
Right Two graves One for the big
chick And one for the little chick

Albuquerque turns the volume back up and ‘KEEPING THE FAITH’
resumes at FULL BLAST

EXT 10 FREEWAY - DAY

‘KEEPING THE FAITH’ keeps playing as the HUMMER ZOOMS down
the 10 FREEWAY through a FOREST OF JOSHUA TREES under
a BLOOD-RED SUN

A gorgeous HAWK flies overhead

FLAGSTAFF can’t help but admire the fiery landscape

EXTINT VALLEYHUMMER - LATER

The SUN is LOW in the sky over the Arizona desert The
Hummer is parked at the top of a valley about a mile across
high on one side high on the other depressed in the middle

The freeway runs right down to the valley floor and up the
other side And at the exact bottom sits Albuquerque’s
ESCALADE its hood popped ALBUQUERQUE watches through HIGH-
POWERED BINOCULARS FLAGSTAFF looks on

Three letters have been added to Albuquerque’s big number ‘3’
on the side of the SUV It now reads ‘H3LP’ (HELP)

There looks to be MOVEMENT UNDER THE HOOD as evidenced by
some moving CLOTH and a SHADOW on the ground

ALBUQUERQUE
(grabs his STEYR AUG rifle)
Knowing them It’s a trap Stay here
Drive down if I signal

FLAGSTAFF
You’re not gonna shoot them

ALBUQUERQUE
Not unless they shoot at me
(slaps a clip into the Steyr
Aug)
Let’s hope they shoot at me

EXTINT VALLEYHUMMER - DAY

ALBUQUERQUE walks toward the Escalade in the smartest
stealthiest way possible using all available cover STEYR
AUG RAISED He looks UNDER the truck No one there He
throws open the tailgate No one there At last he peers
around the hood

A BLOUSE is hanging from the raised hood ornament on a
HANGER ostensibly to provide SHADE for whoever was working
under the hood That’s what was causing the moving SHADOW

Albuquerque steps carefully away from the Escalade until he’s
safely fifty yards off surrounded by flat empty desert
Then he SIGNALS FLAGSTAFF to drive down

CUT TO

FLAGSTAFF pulling up to ALBUQUERQUE in the HUMMER
Albuquerque clambers into the PASSENGER SEAT

Flagstaff cocks his head that would be logical

Flagstaff bites his lip but doesn’t hit the gas Albuquerque
stares for a moment then faces forward

STILLWATER pops up in the back seat pointing Flagstaffs old
SHOTGUN at the back of Albuquerque’s neck Its BARREL has
been SAWED OFF

IMMEDIATELY without hesitation FIRES TWO SHOTGUN BLASTS out
the window Then before Albuquerque’s even recovered from
his flinch she rapidly EJECTS the SHELLS slides in two new
ones and slaps the GUN closed AGAIN

Albuquerque quickly hands his rifle into the BACK SEAT

Flagstaff drives up the far side of the valley

STILLWATER
Now flash your brights

Flagstaff FLASHES the BRIGHTS Immediately WICHITA emerges
from a CLUSTER of ROCKS so WELL HIDDEN it’s like she’s
emerging from thin air Albuquerque raises an eyebrow

FLAGSTAFF
(to Albuquerque gesturing
toward Stillwater)
She was hidden even better
(off Albuquerque’s GLARE)
‘Cause she’s smaller

Wichita aims the AK-47 at Flagstaff and opens his door

WICHITA
I’m the first to admit This is a little
awkward Step away from the vehicle

EXT VALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

ALBUQUERQUE and FLAGSTAFF stand by their duffel bag and

Stillwater hears this and steals a few glances at the vast
burning empty desert as far as the eye can see Wichita
keeps looking determinedly ahead down the road

Stillwater’s last glance is over her shoulder Then she
looks over at Wichita who slowly returns the stare

WICHITA
No

A ‘jama party where if somebody falls
asleep they’re getting stabbed in the
back between the ribs so the knife point
enters their lung instead of their heart
That way they can’t draw breath to
scream
(off Stillwater’s unconcerned
stare)
It’s OK to show fear

Wichita and Flagstaff enter the living room Wichita tosses
CANS of FOOD to Albuquerque and Flagstaff

At the sight of the sunbeam she walks to the window and
looks at her reflection in the glass Grimy skin Stringy
hair She smells something unpleasant then realizes it’s
simply HERSELF sniffing under her arm with a GRIMACE

Wichita is examining her reflection again when her eyes
WIDEN We RACK FOCUS from the pane of glass to the VIEW
beyond BEHIND the homestead There elevated about five
feet off the ground is a big WATER DRUM

EXT HOMESTEAD BACK YARD - MORNING

WICHITA MARCHES across the yard holding some SUPPLIES She
KNOCKS on the side of the drum and hears a watery ECHO Then
she stacks the supplies next to the drum A HOSE a small
HACK-SAW some DUCT-TAPE A HAMMER a big DRILL BIT

--and a BAR of SOAP and BOTTLE of SHAMPOO

Wichita goes to work In close-up we see her SAWING the

of the drum Inserting the hose piece Taping it tight
KINKING the hose Then UNKINKING it for a moment to see the

There are two moments familiar to anyone
whos lived in Zombieland the moment
you wake up in the morning right before

Flagstaff opens his eyes obliviously happy

And then the moment you remember

Flagstaff’s expression immediately grows anxious He takes a
deep breath then gathers his courage to face the day

FLAGSTAFF (VO)

Flagstaff stands up and strides outside

OVER looking through some BOXES

He stands perfectly still silently mesmerized by the sight

EXTINT BEVERLY HILLSCAR - DAY

The GEO METRO coasts past the mansions of Beverly Hills
ALBUQUERQUE is driving FLAGSTAFF is looking around
anxiously ‘White Lines’ has been replaced by an creepy
suspenseful cue Flagstaff sees MOVEMENT in some Oleander
bushes but whatever caused it is quickly gone

FLAGSTAFF
We gotta find somewhere safe Now
Trust me LA’s messed up

ALBUQUERQUE
Yeah Me too
(looks frowns)
Not gonna lie I pictured Tom Cruise
living somewhere nicer Wanna try Jay
Leno’s

FLAGSTAFF raises a MAP in front of his FACE but not just
any map a STAR MAP He and Albuquerque have been trolling
the neighborhood for a pad to set up shop

FLAGSTAFF
(eyes light up)
Slow-slow-slow

Albuquerque slows down and Flagstaff points out a MONSTROUS
GORGEOUS 5-ACRE COMPOUND surrounded by a FENCE dense
FOLIAGE and a massive wrought-iron GATE with an ‘S’ in the
center He looks back toward the Oleander bushes across the
street where a CREEPY ZOMBIE parts the bushes and STARES

FLAGSTAFF
(points)
Fast-fast-fast

Albuquerque PEELS OUT SWINGS a DOUGHNUT in front of the
gate and PARKS Flagstaff FUMBLES with his DOOR HANDLE

EXT COMPOUND - DAY

THUD Albuquerque’s DUFFEL BAG lands in a clump of foliage
followed by THUNK Flagstaff’s ROLLER SUITCASE WHACK
FLAGSTAFF and ALBUQUERQUE JUMP DOWN from the FENCE and into
the back yard of the compound
Then BOOM The ZOMBIE who was watching them SMASHES into
the fence on the other side SHAKING it angrily REACHING
futilely through the bars from mere feet away

Albuquerque ignores the zombie and sets off through THICK
UNDERBRUSH to make it into the yard itself Flagstaff
fearfully gathers their stuff and follows him still playing
the role of the Sherpa

Albuquerque emerges from the foliage followed by Flagstaff
who STOPS to carefully examine his own clothes limbs and
hair

Albuquerque looks back at Flagstaff questioningly

FLAGSTAFF
Tick check

Albuquerque rolls his eyes and continues toward the MANSION
INT MANSION REC ROOM - DAY

A FRENCH DOOR opens onto a downstairs REC ROOM ALBUQUERQUE
walks quietly into the house followed by FLAGSTAFF

There’s a POOL TABLE in the middle of the room Albuquerque

grabs a POOL STICK and TOSSES it to Flagstaff Then he takes
one for himself Not the most deadly of weapons but they’1l
have to do for now

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

FLAGSTAFF and ALBUQUERQUE pool sticks at the ready climb
the stairs to the main floor dominated by a gorgeous LIVING
ROOM

There spread all around the room are monuments to the
career of a certain Hollywood actor

POSTERS of ‘The Outsiders’ ‘Road House’ ‘Red Dawn’ A
SURFBOARD from ‘Point Break’ (sitting on a saw-horse) A
RICKSHAW from ‘City of Joy’

Albuquerque stops in front of the posters He looks giddy
maybe even a little overwhelmed

FLAGSTAFF
Welcome to La Casa De Swayze

ALBUQUERQUE
Confession Patrick Swayze was my hero
I can say that right

FLAGSTAFF
You can You shouldn’t

ALBUQUERQUE
I was just a kid My Dad was outta the
picture And that’s when I saw ‘The
Outsiders’ Cruise Macchio Lowe
Thomas—Howell

FLAGSTAFF
Think it’s just ‘Howell’

ALBUQUERQUE
(completely ignores this)
Estevez Dillon And Patrick Swayze
Rest of ‘em weren’t fit to hold his jock
And after ‘Outsiders’ ‘Renegades’
‘Red Dawn’ ‘Road House’

Albuquerque executes a KARATE MOVE from the movie

FLAGSTAFF
Quite a run

ALBUQUERQUE

I modeled my life after Swayze’s Then
just like that it ended My sis brought
home a Betamax of Swayze’s latest movie
I sat and watched my hero slip on a tank
top And dance the Pachanga

(snaps out of it)
You imagine what that was like

FLAGSTAFF
(nods )
I saw the movie
ALBUQUERQUE
Dirty Fucking Dancing Never has a
man who kicked so much ass shaken

so much ass
(angry far-off stare)
I never forgave the son-of-a-bitch
INT PATRICK SWAYZE’S KITCHEN - DAY
Albuquerque finishes throwing open a series of CUPBOARDS

ALBUQUERQUE
And no Twinkies either

Albuquerque SLAMS shut the nearest cupboard ANGRILY

ALBUQUERQUE
I knew we shoulda gone to Travolta’s
FLAGSTAFF
(whispers ‘be quiet’)
Hello ‘inside voice’ ‘Til we make

sure we’re alone You take upstairs
INT MASTER SUITE - DAY
ALBUQUERQUE makes sure the coast is clear in the master
suite confidently striding around the room pausing to
admire the WIDE-SCREEN TV
INT LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

By contrast a trepidant FLAGSTAFF uses his POOL STICK to
flip a light switch in the downstairs laundry room

INT EXERCISE ROOM - DAY

ALBUQUERQUE searches an exercise room pausing to do a couple
CABLE-PULLEY CROSSOVER chest exercises in the mirror Still
got it

INT POWDER ROOM - DAY

FLAGSTAFF peers into a powder room scrunches up his face in
disgust and uses his pool stick to FLUSH the TOILET

INT GUEST BEDROOM - DAY

Albuquerque searches a guest bedroom nearly STEPPING ON (but
FAILING to NOTICE) a GRIMY HAND protruding from under the
bed The hand remains still and Albuquerque exits the room

INT FOYER - DAY

FLAGSTAFF and ALBUQUERQUE spot each other Albuquerque at
the top of the stairs Flagstaff at the bottom

FLAGSTAFF
All clear

ALBUQUERQUE
Crystal

INT MASTER SUITE - DAY

ALBUQUERQUE is back in the master suite where he opens the
DVD PLAYER to find ‘Road House’ already sitting in it
ALBUQUERQUE
Excellent

Albuquerque plops onto the master bed and watches ‘Road
House’ on the wide screen TV He’s cued up the scene where
the bad guy wields a POOL STICK in the bar swinging it
around like a martial arts STAFF

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Downstairs FLAGSTAFF finds a STEREO and flips it on He
checks the CD inside No way

FLAGSTAFF
What were the chances
(thinks)
Actually probably pretty good

For fun he cues up the right track CRANKS up the volume
and hits ‘play’

We hear the first distinctive notes of Bill Medley’s and
Jennifer Warnes’s ‘(IVE HAD) THE TIME OF MY LIFE’ from the
‘Dirty Dancing’ soundtrack As Flagstaff walks back across
the living room a little ashamed he can’t suppress the
TINIEST of dance moves

INT GUEST BEDROOM —- CONTINUOUS

We’re back upstairs where we can now hear the music BLASTING
from downstairs Still motionless underneath the bed that
Albuquerque forgot to look under is the HAND

And protruding from another side of the bed a BARE FOOT
In time to the music the foot starts to involuntarily TAP

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

FLAGSTAFF emerges from the kitchen with a tall glass of ICE
WATER embarrassedly mouthing the words to the song

INT GUEST BEDROOM —- CONTINUOUS

The BODY under the bed CRAWLS OUT and STANDS UP We only get
a good glimpse of the LEGS and bare FEET blood-spattered
but none the worse for wear They walk out of the room
gracefully as if belonging to a dancer IN TIME TO THE
MUSIC

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

FLAGSTAFF spies another treasure in the living room The
POTTERS WHEEL from ‘Ghost’ This is just too much of a

guilty pleasure He embarrassedly sashays over to it and
pops the lid on a BUCKET next to the wheel

There’s still CLAY inside Flagstaff sits at the wheel
grabs a chunk of clay and uses some of his glass of WATER to
WET it DOWN

Then he turns ON the machine lets the wheel get up to speed
and starts to make a POT

INT STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

As ‘(I’VE HAD) THE TIME OF MY LIFE’ continues to play the
ZOMBIFIED LEGSFEET start walking down the stairs Very
gracefully And still in time to the beat

INT MASTER SUITE - CONTINUOUS

Meanwhile ALBUQUERQUE can’t really hear the music
downstairs He’s still way too engrossed in ‘Road House’
Swayze is lighting up the screen in a knock-down drag-out
fight with the villain

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

FLAGSTAFF is shaping his CLAY into a cylinder making it
rise totally into it

-when a figure approaches him from behind still out of
focus still oddly graceful somehow

The figure lowers into frame wrapping its arms AROUND
Flagstaff then finally closing its hands around Flagstaff’s
hands on the spinning CLAY

It’s as though Flagstaff has been ELECTRIFIED He YELPS and
LEAPS into the air STEPPING onto the SPINNING wheel He
immediately loses his balance and FALLS back onto the wheel
Its momentum SHOOTS him to one side clear of the ominous
figure

Flagstaff rolls to his knees and STARES up into the face of
the one the only

-PATRICK SWAYZE Now zombiefied Horrifying And not
just because of the bleeding eyes Tight jeans Tank top
And early-stages MULLET

For so many reasons Flagstaff SCREAMS

INT MASTER SUITE - CONTINUOUS

Simultaneously Kelly Lynch SCREAMS at the sight of the fight
in ‘Road House’ MASKING Flagstaff’s scream downstairs
ALBUQUERQUE couldn’t be more entranced

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Still set to the bouncy upbeat song FLAGSTAFF SPRINTS
around the living room with SWAYZE in hot pursuit

It’s a totally frenetic CHASE-TO-THE-DEATH Over counter-
tops Coffee tables Across the clay-spattered marble
which causes both Flagstaff and Swayze to SLIP and FALL

Flagstaff’s feet struggle to gain traction on the wet clay
but he manages to dive UNDER the ‘Point Break’ surf board and
then bounces back to his FEET keeping it between him and
Swayze

FLAGSTAFF
Please I actually kinda liked you in
‘Point Break’

Swayze BULL-RUSHES knocking the surf board AND Flagstaff to
the ground He manages to grab hold of Flagstaff’s shoe

Flagstaff desperate for any advantage grabs the SURF
BOARD’s LEASH and tethers it to Swayze’s ANKLE Then his
CLAY-SPATTERED shoe SLIPS from Swayze’s grasp but not before
it POPS OFF at the HEEL Flagstaff scurries away trying to
unsuccessfully to stomp his heel back down into the shoe

Swayze SPRINTS after Flagstaff again The SURF BOARD drags
behind his ankle TUGGED by its leash It SWINGS in a WIDE
ARC and CRUSHES the potter’s wheel The spinning wheel
ENTANGLES the leash and YANKS Swayze back to the floor

Flagstaff finally stoops to pull his shoe back over his heel
Like lightning Swayze undoes the leash from his ankle and
KIPS UP to his FEET

An awed Flagstaff dashes toward the far side of the room
again rolling the ‘City of Joy’ RICKSHAW between himself and
Swayze Swayze merely BALLET-LEAPS over it

At last Swayze HORSE-COLLARS Flagstaff and spins him around
From our vantage point across the room it looks like they
very well MIGHT be DANCING

Flagstaff raises an arm to protect himself but Swayze grabs
it and TWIRLS him closer As Swayze finally pulls him into
his clutches a VOICE rings out

ALBUQUERQUE (0S)
May I cut in

Swayze holding Flagstaff like a dance partner looks up to
see ALBUQUERQUE standing at the bottom of the stairs
holding the POOL STICK menacingly at his side

Albuquerque slowly steps forward For effect he tries to
SPIN and TWIRL the pool stick around like the villain in the
movie Only he’s terrible at it He hilariously BANGS the
stick off a lamp then off the marble floor which SNAPS it
nearly in half

Albuquerque spends a couple seconds trying to force the two
halves back together then CHUCKS it ASIDE Gonna rely on
the fists He POINTS his index finger at Swayze then turns
it around and BECKONS him as if to say ‘Come and get it’

ALBUQUERQUE
Let’s dance

Swayze stares at Albuquerque uncomprehending behind the
rage

FLAGSTAFF
Um By ‘dance’ he means ‘fight’

The Swayze zombie has heard enough He TOSSES Flagstaff
ASIDE and SPRINTS across the room toward Albuquerque

Swayze snarls Albuquerque bellows back

At last when he is within a couple feet of Albuquerque
Swayze LEAPS FORWARD at him

Albuquerque CATCHES Swayze at the WAIST with BOTH HANDS and
LIFTS him UP in the air until they are forming a ‘T’
Albuquerque with his hands straight overhead and Swayze doing
a swan dive parallel to the ground

That’s right it’s the classic ‘LIFT’ performed by Swayze and
Grey at the end of ‘Dirty Dancing’

Except this lift sees SWAYZE’s momentum carry him HEAD-FIRST
into a PILLAR in the living room

There is a sickening CRUNCH and Albuquerque DROPS a suddenly
lifeless Swayze - KER-THUNK - to the ground As if on cue
Flagstaff picks up the stereo remote and KILLS the MUSIC

ALBUQUERQUE
(repeats the classic line from
‘Dirty Dancing’ )
Nobody puts Baby in a corner

Flagstaff’s heel finally PLOPS down into his shoe He walks
over to Albuquerque who angrily KICKS the motionless SWAYZE
once for each career misstep

ALBUQUERQUE
That’s for ‘Dirty Dancing’ That’s for
‘City of Joy’ That’s for ‘Father Hood’

Superimposed onscreen A TITLE 3 Double Tap The title
FLASHES once for each of Albuquerque’s kicks

FLAGSTAFF
And that’s for ‘Havana Nights’

Flagstaff dispenses a KICK of his own then allows himself a
little SMILE

Superimposed onscreen A TITLE 32 Enjoy the Little
Things

ALBUQUERQUE
So whaddya think ‘Zombie Kill of the
Week’ Brought to you by Mrs
Renfro’s Black Bean Salsa

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Close but no cigar Zombie Kill of the
Week honors already went out to Cynthia
Newsome of Monroe Louisiana

CUT TO
EXT SUBURBAN DRIVEWAY - DAY

We suddenly find ourselves in a sweet southern suburban
neighborhood

A sixty-something woman CYNTHIA NEWSOME drives recklessly
into her driveway SCREAMING There is a ZOMBIE CRAWLING
through the SUNROOF of her Chevy Malibu as she drives trying
to BITE her Its waist and legs PROTRUDE out the top of the
car

Cynthia hits the BUTTON of her GARAGE DOOR REMOTE The
garage DOOR starts to open slowly rising up

Instead of waiting for the door to rise all the way Cynthia
guns the accelerator The door CUTS the ZOMBIE in HALF at
the waist

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Impressive

EXT COMPOUND - DAY

With comical difficulty FLAGSTAFF and ALBUQUERQUE try to
lift PATRICK SWAYZE now SHROUDED in a sheet UP and OVER the
fence surrounding the compound and into the YARD next door

FLAGSTAFF
(straining under the weight)
Actually glad we’re not at
Travolta’s

After some slapsticky moments they finally manage to heave
the body over the fence Swayze’s corpse TUMBLES down the
slope into the YARD on the other side ROLLING out of its
sheet in the process Flagstaff bites his lip

FLAGSTAFF
He deserved better Wrapping I mean

The pair looks at one another Should we bother Nah They
TURN and walk back toward the house Flagstaff takes out a
small plastic BOTTLE and SQUIRTS some solution on his HANDS

FLAGSTAFF
Purell

ALBUQUERQUE
Please

Flagstaff TOSSES Albuquerque the bottle Albuquerque uses
some Purell then tosses it back

FLAGSTAFF
Think Sigourney Weaver will get pissed
when she finds Swayze in her yard

ALBUQUERQUE
Ripley can deal

INT STEAM ROOM - DAY

ALBUQUERQUE and FLAGSTAFF are living it up Swayze style
They’re having a SCHVITZ in Patrick’s STEAM ROOM We pan
from Albuquerque to Flagstaff Albuquerque is wrapped in a
‘HIS’ towel Flagstaff stuck with ‘HERS’
INT MASTER SUITE - LATER

ALBUQUERQUE and FLAGSTAFF lounge in two big plush CHAIRS in
Swayzes bedroom Albuquerque is now in Swayze’s SILK
ROBE and COWBOY BOOTS Flagstaff by contrast is
sporting high-waisted SLACKS and a big-collared shirt
straight from Swayze’s ‘Road House’ days They’re both
looking and feeling refreshed Relaxed

In the master suite is a huge OIL PAINTING of Patrick bare-
backing a HORSE his mullet blowing in the wind

On the table to Flagstaff’s right is a BOX ‘Conversation
Starters’ Why not Flagstaff reaches in and picks a card

FLAGSTAFF
You’re throwing a dinner party You can
invite five people dead or alive

ALBUQUERQUE
First two easy Elvis Brando This
is where it gets interesting Kylie
Minogue Don’t ask Cuatro Mother
Theresa
(pauses contemplative)
And last but not least Buck

FLAGSTAFF
Says people Not pets You get one
more

ALBUQUERQUE
(angry)
It’s my God Damn dinner party I want
Buck End of fucking discussion

An awkward silence

FLAGSTAFF
(reads off box faux excited)
‘Conversation Starters’

Flagstaff tosses the game across the room

ALBUQUERQUE
(far off look)
Never thought I could love anything like
Buck Day he was born I lost my mind
He was just like me ‘Cept littler Had
my personality My laugh My
appetite

Flagstaff is nodding as he listens right to the point where
he stops nodding looking puzzled

FLAGSTAFF
‘Laugh’

Suddenly Flagstaff’s expression freezes with recognition

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
And just like that I knew I felt so
ashamed That it had taken me this long
Me with the best cardio in the business
to realize JI wasnt the only one
running from something

FLAGSTAFF looks sympathetically at ALBUQUERQUE who’s got
mist in his eyes

FLAGSTAFF
(almost whispered)
We still talking about a dog
Albuquerque’s face reveals untold pain
SMASH CUT TO
INT KITCHENBATHROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

We see ALBUQUERQUE pre-Zombieland cooking PANCAKES It is
the SAME flashback from earlier in the story

only THIS TIME Albuquerque isn’t cooking for a dog but a
BOY Albuquerque’s SON BUCK Two years old Sandy blond
hair Sporting a Janikowski Raiders jersey

We see a series of quick FLASHES - the very same scenes we
saw earlier only now with the BOY instead of the dog

Glimpses of Albuquerque WATCHING HAPPILY as his SON gobbles
up the pancakes

Albuquerque running in and out of frame carrying Buck up in
the air zooming him around like an AIRPLANE

Albuquerque falling to the ground with Buck blowing
RASPBERRIES on his BELLY and ESKIMO-KISSING him

ALBUQUERQUE giving BUCK a BATH The little boy wearing swim
goggles And a baby SPEEDO
Albuquerque shapes Buck’s hair into a MOHAWK Buck giggles
infectiously Albuquerque melts

SMASH CUT BACK TO
INT MASTER SUITE - DAY
ALBUQUERQUE turns to meet FLAGSTAFF’s stare

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Take away a mans son youve truly given
him nothing left to lose

A single tear trickles from behind Albuquerque’s glasses down
his cheek

FLAGSTAFF
Got any pictures

Albuquerque nods reaches for his WALLET and hands it to
Flagstaff The very act of admitting the truth causes
Albuquerque to break down weeping

Flagstaff looks at the cute wallet PHOTOS of Albuquerque’s
LOST BOY BUCK then at last reaches across and puts one
hand on Albuquerque’s SHOULDER

DISSOLVE TO
INT MASTER SUITE - LATER

HONK ALBUQUERQUE comes out of the master bathroom back into
the master suite BLOWING his NOSE loudly into some KLEENEX

ALBUQUERQUE
Jezus Haven’t cried like that since
well ‘Ghost’ Sorry if I got kinda

gay

FLAGSTAFF
Blame me

ALBUQUERQUE
(smirks)
If the high-waisted slacks fit

FLAGSTAFF
Says the man in the paisley silk robe and
cowboy boots

Albuquerque smiles more fully and looks pensively at the
painting of Patrick and his stallion trying to reestablish
an atmosphere of heterosexuality

ALBUQUERQUE
Man If I was Swayze back in the day
I woulda pulled down so much ass

FLAGSTAFF
Me too Me too

DISSOLVE TO
INT MASTER BATH - DAY

It’s later in the day and we’re now in the MASTER BATH
FLAGSTAFF dressed in his own clothes again is rifling
through Swayze’s MEDICINE CABINET Not as much for supplies
as to satisfy his curiosity

FLAGSTAFF
(to himself)
People Magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive
1991 what’s your secret

INT GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

ALBUQUERQUE also dressed in his regular clothes again (and
holding a couple sets of CAR KEYS) tours Swayze’s garage
There sits a gorgeous black YUKON DENALI SUV He unlocks the
Denali looks around inside and lights up at the sight of a
BUTTON on the DASH He jabs the button and waits

DETROIT (VO)
On-Star how can I help you Mr
(a beat)
Swayze

ALBUQUERQUE
(disguises voice)
Hey baby Please call me Pat

DETROIT (V0)
Thought we’d been through this Mr
Swayze Make one more inappropriate
pass and I lock you out of your car
Again

Albuquerque can’t help CRACKING UP CLICK Detroit HANGS
UP Albuquerque frowns and hits the On-Star button several
more times At last

DETROIT (VO)
(dispensing with the usual
politeness)

I told you

ALBUQUERQUE
Detroit it’s me Albuquerque You
don’t hafta worry about Swayze any more
(a moment of silence)
He’s Sigourney Weavers problem now

DETROIT (VO)
Albie sweetheart Praise Jesus Been

Hummer’s totaled

Albuquerque perks up and assumes a look of smug SATISFACTION

ALBUQUERQUE
You just saved me my next question

INT FOYER - DAY

FLAGSTAFF and ALBUQUERQUE ARGUE in the FOYER Flagstaff’s
hair is slicked back He’s obviously partaken of some of
Swayze’s styling ‘products’

FLAGSTAFF
But we have to try to help Rollover
alert crumple zone alert airbags
deployed They’re probably lying out
there right now bleeding trapped

ALBUQUERQUE
(enjoying the sound)
I’m painting a mental picture

FLAGSTAFF
You don’t mean that

Albuquerque hears the pain in Flagstaff’s voice REALIZES

ALBUQUERQUE
Oh My God You like Wichita

FLAGSTAFF
Get outta here

ALBUQUERQUE
You’ve been thinking of fucking her
Wish granted She’s spent the last
twenty-four hours fucking you I ain’t
helping Those two deserve what they
get

FLAGSTAFF
Suit yourself
(off Albuquerque’s inquisitive
look)
But their pictures were once in someones
wallet too

Flagstaff walks out Albuquerque stands silently knowing
he’s suddenly and completely LOST the debate He sighs

ALBUQUERQUE
Starting to hate that skinny little
douche

EXT 10 FREEWAY - DAY

The DENALI ZOOMS EAST on the 10 FREEWAY another big WHITE
NUMBER ‘3’ scrawled on both sides and the hood ALBUQUERQUE
is driving FLAGSTAFF is in the passenger seat

EXT 10 FREEWAY OFF-RAMP - DAY

The DENALI pulls onto an OFF-RAMP that overlooks a GAS
STATION MINI-MART It comes to a STOP

EXTINT MINI-MARTYUKON DENALI —- DAY
ALBUQUERQUE and FLAGSTAFF crane their necks to look down

They SPOT the HUMMER OVERTURNED on the street outside the
Mini-Mart SMASHED into a TELEPHONE POLE It is SWARMING
with SIX or so ZOMBIES inside and out There are various
other zombies perched around the Mini-Mart parking lot Plus
some OTHERS lurching down nearby streets

WICHITA and STILLWATER are obviously TOAST

ALBUQUERQUE
Rest their souls

Flagstaff looks DEVASTATED He opens the door and jumps out
of the Denali to TOSS his COOKIES

EXT 10 FREEWAY OFF-RAMP OUTSIDE MINI-MART - LATER

FLAGSTAFF and ALBUQUERQUE are now in a heated discussion in
the DENALI at the top of the off-ramp

FLAGSTAFF
Are your glasses foggy It’s over I’m
not driving down there They’re crawling
all over the place
Flagstaff

ALBUQUERQUE
With or without you I’m going

FLAGSTAFF
Look I was the one who wanted to save
the girls But they’re gone

ALBUQUERQUE
It’s not the girls I’m after

stares uncomprehending Then he REALIZES

FLAGSTAFF
Ohhhh no You’d risk our lives for a
(off Albuquerque’s nod)
-Twinkie Nice logic smart guy
Won’t stick out your neck for a person
But a Twinkie Did I mention I made
perfectly good macaroni salad

Albuquerque STARES Flagstaff down LIVID A few beats pass
Albuquerque is on the verge of creaming someone Flagstaff
is on the verge of BEING CREAMED by someone

ALBUQUERQUE
‘Smart guy’

FLAGSTAFF
(realizes he’s on thin thin
ice)
Let me begin my three-part apology by
saying

ALBUQUERQUE
No it’s OK

Albuquerque takes a deep relaxing breath All is good

ALBUQUERQUE
But FYI I’ve beat wholesale ass for
less than that

Flagstaff almost says something then thinks better of it

ALBUQUERQUE
I’m gonna explain And then this United
States Citizen is driving Pat Swayze’s
Yukon Denali to the local Mini-Mart for
some Twinkies With or without the kind
of pussy who eats macaroni salad

FLAGSTAFF
I unreservedly apologize

ALBUQUERQUE

(not listening)
There’s a box of Twinkies down in that
Mini-Mart Not just any box of Twinkies
The last box of Twinkies that I or
anyone will enjoy for all of
time in the whole universe ‘Cause
there’s an expiration date on Twinkies
And the Hostess factories are gone So
some day very soon life’s little Twinkie
gauge is gonna hit Empty

Albuquerque reaches into the back seat and grabs his DUFFEL
BAG which he holds on his LAP

ALBUQUERQUE
Now true you probably won’t survive
the next ten minutes But if you do
youll be one of the last two guys in the
universe to enjoy the spongy outside and
creamy inside of a delicious Twinkie
Worth it right

FLAGSTAFF
No And I’m so scared I’m about to shit
my pants For which there’s precedent

Flagstaff picks up one of the new SHOTGUNS grabs his roller
suitcase and opens the passenger door

FLAGSTAFF
So this is goodbye
ALBUQUERQUE
Fair enough As a couple we were
pretty
FLAGSTAFF
Odd
ALBUQUERQUE
I was gonna say crappy One favor
FLAGSTAFF
Yeah
ALBUQUERQUE

(conspiratorial as in ‘your
secret’s safe with me’)
Got a last known address for Ms
Beverly Hills

FLAGSTAFF
Like I would give that to you

ALBUQUERQUE
(beat)
Well I’m no good at goodbyes so
(stumped)
-that’1l do pig

FLAGSTAFF
That’s the worst goodbye I’ve ever heard
And you stole it from a movie

ALBUQUERQUE
Totally embarrassing Get outta the
truck

Flagstaff steps out onto the running board But he can’t
quite bring himself to jump from the DENALI Instead he
LINGERS standing on the running board looking at the
horizon

ALBUQUERQUE
Go on

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
Albuquerque once said You know home by
the way it makes you feel when you leave
That face Thats me realizing that at
least for now this stupid big truck in
this silly little neighborhood and that
stupid big guy in those silly little
glasses They were as close as I was
gonna get to home

Flagstaff tosses his suitcase BACK INTO THE SUV He plops
down in the PASSENGER SEAT FASTENS HIS SEATBELT and COCKS
HIS SHOTGUN

FLAGSTAFF
Let’s fuck us up some Twinkies

Albuquerque nods and slings the duffel bag over his SHOULDER

ALBUQUERQUE
Buckle up

FLAGSTAFF
Way ahead of you

Albuquerque goes to PUNCH Flagstaff in the ARM hard but
slows down at the last second barely TAPPING him
ALBUQUERQUE
Almost forgot

Albuquerque reaches up and hits the ON-STAR BUTTON again

DETROIT (VO)
On-Star How can I help you

ALBUQUERQUE
Detroit Albuquerque Bad news Really
bad

DETROIT (VO)
(long pause)
Rest their souls

ALBUQUERQUE
That’s exactly what I said We’re about
to stir some shit up anyway

DETROIT (VO)
No way I can talk you out of it

ALBUQUERQUE
Nah But if we go silent send a posse

DETROIT (VO)
You realize I have like five total
clients

ALBUQUERQUE
Six if Flagstaff makes it through

DETROIT (VO)
The nearest friendly car is in Provo
Utah so don’t expect a rescue party
(repeats her signature line)
Good luck God bless
(pause)
And thank you for using On-Star

CLICK
FLAGSTAFF
Can we go back to the part where I don’t

survive the next ten minutes

Albuquerque smirks and slides on a pair of prescription blue
SUNGLASSES

ALBUQUERQUE
Gonna be a hairy ten minutes

We’re high above the DENALI at the top of the OFF-RAMP
poised for the greatest orgy of gun-powder in zombie history

Superimposed onscreen A TITLE CARD MTwinkies
The engine RUMBLES We’re back inside

ALBUQUERQUE
Ready

FLAGSTAFF
Ready-ish

Albuquerque reaches down and turns ON his HIGHLY AMPLIFIED
CAR STEREO

There’s only one SONG in the world that could accompany
Albuquerque as he does what he’s about to do

CYPRESS HILL’S ‘(ROCK) SUPERSTAR’

The equalizer starts to JUMP The song begins its BUILD
We’re in SLOW MOTION getting ready for some violence

Flagstaff STRETCHES his triceps Albuquerque TURNS OFF the
AIR CONDITIONING and REVS the ACCELERATOR the ENGINE
GROWLS behind the GRILLE

One of the MANY ZOMBIES in the PARKING LOT and around the
HUMMER looks up to locate the source of the ENGINE

Albuquerque GRABS the GEAR SHIFT and PULLS IT DOWN from ‘P’

to ‘N’ to ‘D’ Flagstaff grabs the JESUS STRIP (that little
handle above the car door) the back tires SPIN throwing

off BLUE SMOKE

The DENALI BUCKS and GALLOPS down the off-ramp

All the ZOMBIES perk up drawn to the noise Suddenly we’re
back at REGULAR SPEED

Albuquerque drives with one hand screaming down the ramp
gaining speed faster FASTER

-then cuts the wheel at the bottom and AIMS for the PARKING
LOT The Denali nearly goes up on TWO WHEELS

The music is POUNDING

FLAGSTAFF
They’11 run

ALBUQUERQUE
I know

The zombies start to move en masse toward the oncoming truck
Albuquerque aims slightly to the RIGHT of their cluster

The zombies start to step to Albuquerque’s LEFT to get out of
the way Albuquerque holds his course

The zombies BAIL OUT to the LEFT Will Albuquerque MISS
ALTOGETHER

At the last possible moment Albuquerque PULLS the EMERGENCY
BRAKE and YANKS the WHEEL to the RIGHT The SUV’s back end
starts SKIDDING around to the LEFT

it’s the beginning of that classic ROCKFORD FILES fast 180
DEGREE TURN The zombies are still BAILING LEFT when

--The long BACK END of the DENALI SWINGS the REST of the way
around SWATTING them all down

BANG BANG BANG they all DROP like BOWLING PINS

Albuquerque completes the maneuver sliding backwards past
the tangled MESS of FALLEN ZOMBIES

Flagstaff is awestruck That was unbelievable

Albuquerque hits the FOUR-WHEEL-DRIVE button Then drives
OVER the zombies as if they were SPEED-BUMPS

Then he jams it into REVERSE and BACKS OVER them again
Superimposed onscreen A TITLE 3 Double Tap

Flagstaff has his head out the window watching the zombie
bodies get MUSHED under the truck He pulls his head back
into the cab and looks at Albuquerque majorly impressed
Without pause Albuquerque PARKS the DENALI next to some GAS
PUMPS steps out onto the RUNNING BOARD and yanks something
from his DUFFEL BAG

An AIR-HORN He aims it into the air and BLASTS three times
in succession in perfect beat to the MUSIC

Flagstaff’s EYES WIDEN in fear
We see THREE QUICK-CUTS of groups of ZOMBIES in nearby areas

PERKING UP at the sound of the HORN a VACANT LOT a VIDEO
STORE a TACO STAND

ALBUQUERQUE
Flagstaff

FLAGSTAFF
Albuquerque

ALBUQUERQUE
Get on the roof The hood’s twelve
oclock The trunk’s six You’re my
eyes

Flagstaff NODS and tries to CLAMBER onto the ROOF of the
Denali He slips and BANGS his KNEE in the attempt

Flagstaff shakes off the pain makes it onto the roof and
begins searching for zombies We take his POV as he
spins looking for movement

He spies a TRIO on the move toward the DENALI at the EIGHT
OCLOCK POSITION

FLAGSTAFF
Uh two o’clock Wait the hood was
twelve Crap Eight o’clock

Ever see the gunfight in the movie ‘Heat’ That’s the kind
of intensity Albuquerque is about to deliver He plucks his
STEYR AUG OUT of his BAG and walks around the SUV to the
eight o’clock position

Albuquerque leans against the SUV to steady his aim then
FIRES

BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM We didn’t know guns could be this loud
FIRE spitting out of the muzzle SHELLS stinging the
pavement Zombies FACE-PLANTING

Flagstaff pauses to watch then snaps out of it and continues
to scan the horizon for fast-approaching zombies

FLAGSTAFF
Eleven

Albuquerque CIRCLES the SUV kneels against the front bumper
to steady himself and starts FIRING AGAIN ZOMBIES DROP
One tries to get back up BAM Another shot

FLAGSTAFF
Six

RUN RUN BAM-BAM-BAM

FLAGSTAFF
Nine

JOG JOG BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM

We’re HIGH ABOVE the DENALI looking from a BIRD’S-EYE-VIEW
as ZOMBIES run from distant locations toward the truck from
virtually EVERY angle

SLAP Another BANANA CLIP goes into the GUN

FLAGSTAFF
Four

BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM BAM-BAM BAM

FLAGSTAFF
Two

BAM-BAM-JAM-CLICK

The gun has JAMMED Albuquerque wrestles with it for a
second trying to un-jam it

FLAGSTAFF
Two

Flagstaff gets rattled by the fact there are still three
zombies COMING But Albuquerque doesn’t ever get rattled
He DITCHES the STEYR AUG and digs in his duffel bag

We take the ZOMBIES’ POV as they RUSH toward a GUY who is
kneeling with his back turned They’re almost upon him when
he STANDS and TURNS holding TWO HUGE 50 CALIBER DESERT
EAGLE PISTOLS palms facing the ground like a GANGSTA

BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM The zombies have
nowhere to go but down

FLAGSTAFF
Eleven And three

Albuquerque moves to the front corner of the truck takes aim
at both eleven and three and fires in BOTH DIRECTIONS one
with EACH pistol BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM

Two CLIPS fall Two NEW clips go in BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM

Zombies drop But Flagstaff is ALARMED There are a lot of
ZOMBIES with a head start headed for the BACK of the truck

FLAGSTAFF
Nine Six Five Basically nine to
five

Albuquerque finishes shooting JAMS in new clips and runs UP
the DENALI from front bumper to windshield to roof past
Flagstaff JUMPING off the back

He LANDS with a THUD boots on concrete There are EIGHT
zombies bearing down on him

What happens next is the stuff of legend Albuquerque shifts
his weight from one foot to the other like a BOXER and then
starts fighting HAND to HAND only he’s using the pistols
as extensions of his fists shooting at the MOMENT he
delivers each PUNCH

In other words it looks like Albuquerque is fighting ina
Rocky movie but every punch carries with it the extra oomph
of a discharged 50 caliber BULLET

The zombies arrive ONE-BY-ONE Boom A right CROSS to the
TEMPLE

Now vicious BODY-SHOTS to the stomach BOOM BOOM BOOM
BOOM-BOOM A one-two combination to the JAW

UPPERCUTS to the CHIN BOOM BOOM

More BODY-SHOTS BOOM-BOOM-BOOM

Cypress Hill is still SLAMMING over the speakers Zombies
FLY and FLOP in every direction

The last ZOMBIE trips before he can get punched So
ALBUQUERQUE PUNCHES him on the GROUND BOOM BOOM BOOM

By the end Albuquerque is just venting RAGE

Flagstaff is SO ENTRANCED that he hasn’t remembered to keep
looking out specifically behind him ALBUQUERQUE looks in
Flagstaff’s direction and his expression narrows

ALBUQUERQUE
Twelve

Flagstaff SPINS around to see ONE ZOMBIE running right up the
HOOD of the SUV at him and about FIFTEEN ZOMBIES about
SEVENTY YARDS BEHIND His expression is one of sheer TERROR
Flagstaff FLINCHES and DUCKS taking out the feet of the
zombie which TRIPS right over him sliding to the back of
the roof It looks up

right into the BARREL of ALBUQUERQUE’s 50 CAL BOOM

A SHELL-SHOCKED Flagstaff looks off the hood to where the
oncoming zombies are no more than FIFTY YARDS AWAY

ALBUQUERQUE
Got a lighter

Flagstaff shakes off his shock long enough to register
Albuquerque’s question He digs into his pants pocket
produces a small ZIP-LOC BAG fishes out a BIC LIGHTER and
tosses it to ALBUQUERQUE

Superimposed onscreen A TITLE 2 JZip-Loc Bags

Albuquerque catches the lighter He whips out his WALLET
flips out his VISA CARD slides it through the GAS PUMP SLOT
chooses ‘87’ octane and yanks out the forward-most NOZZLE

Then Albuquerque JUMPS onto the HOOD He holds the lighter
in front of the NOZZLE

He flicks on a FLAME and clamps down the lever to start
PUMPING GAS Only one problem

NOTHING COMES OUT

Back on the pump the little LCD screen reads ‘Waiting for
Approval’ Flagstaff and Albuquerque share a look

FLAGSTAFF
How’s your credit

ALBUQUERQUE
(a little embarrassed)
Not terrible

The sprinting ZOMBIES reach the SUV and START TO CLIMB ONTO
THE HOOD

Back on the PUMP there’s a BEEP and the SCREEN reads
‘Begin Fueling’

At that INSTANT a JET of FLAME SHOOTS OUT of the front of
the NOZZLE and ALBUQUERQUE is suddenly behind the greatest
FLAME THROWER EVER

Zombies clamber up the car then peel away as they catch fire
and COMBUST
He SPRAYS the stream of flame LEFT and RIGHT in long arcs
like he’s watering the lawn

Then he starts to wield it like that FIRE WHIP of the BALROG
in ‘Lord of the Rings’

Then he starts using it like a gun a shot here and there
At long last the final zombie falls in a burning heap
Flagstaff turns in a full circle Not a zombie in sight
Anywhere

It’s over

Cypress Hill’s song finishes playing with a flourish
ALBUQUERQUE lets out an ADRENALIZED PRIMAL VICTORY SCREAM

Albuquerque strolls over and nonchalantly GASSES UP his
Denali Flagstaff and Albuquerque look at one another A
beat

FLAGSTAFF
It’s a pleasure watching you work

SMASH CUT TO
INT MINI-MART - DAY
WHACK ALBUQUERQUE kicks open the front door of the MINI-
MART He and FLAGSTAFF each carry SHOTGUNS They move

around the store searching for zombies making sure they
cover every nook and cranny

FLAGSTAFF
If you don’t mind how’d you become such
a uh
ALBUQUERQUE
rock-star
FLAGSTAFF
Yeah
ALBUQUERQUE

My Mom used to tell me Don’t worry
someday you’1ll be good at something

When they’re satisfied that they’re alone the two meet in
the middle of the store their BACKS to the HOSTESS RACK

Suddenly they hear the sound of CRINKLING PLASTIC What
exactly is that noise and WHERE is it coming from

Albuquerque SHUSHES Flagstaff The CRINKLING is coming from
right BEHIND them and it’s getting LOUDER

Without wasting another moment a JUMPY Flagstaff SPINS and
opens fire MERCILESSLY with his SHOTGUN THUMP THUMP
THUMP THUMP Stuff CRASHES and SPLATTERS everywhere

Flagstaff stops shooting breathing hard with fear

A RAT emerges from an open DORITO’S BAG on the floor then
scurries away Albuquerque looks from the Dorito’s bag to
Flagstaff to the now-DESTROYED HOSTESS RACK

Every TWINKIE BOX has been blasted into SMITHEREENS

The pair realizes Flagstaff’s mistake simultaneously The
only box that somehow got spared SNO-BALLS

ALBUQUERQUE
Eat a Sno-Ball I’1l kill you myself

FLAGSTAFF
Words can’t begin to express

ALBUQUERQUE
(wipes at his eye)
No Don’t It’s too soon

The two bow their heads Then

FLAGSTAFF
You’11l want a moment alone

Flagstaff heads out the FRONT

ALBUQUERQUE
Guard the door I’m checking the back
room For survivors
(to himself)
Golden spongy creamy survivors

Albuquerque is ALONE doing the kind of thing Flagstaff likes
to warn against He REACHES behind the counter

Is it possible that his arm is about to get CHOMPED ON by a
ravenous hidden zombie The music SWELLS

Nope

Albuquerque snags some KEYS and walks BACK to the LOCKED
STORE ROOM DOOR

Albuquerque unlocks the door then steps back and NUDGES it
open with his boot It creaks aside ominously Then

CRASH An impatient Albuquerque KICKS it open the rest of
the way We almost have a HEART ATTACK

Next Albuquerque uses the BARREL of his SHOTGUN to FLICK the
LIGHT SWITCH inside the door We’re suddenly INSIDE the
room looking back out at ALBUQUERQUE in the open door He
lowers his shotgun his expression one of complete SHOCK

ALBUQUERQUE
Holy Shit

EXT MINI-MART —- DAY

FLAGSTAFF is about twenty feet in front of the Mini-Mart
kneeling carefully reloading his SHOTGUN with shells from
his trusty ZIP-LOC BAG

He HEARS the door of the Mini-Mart OPEN behind him
Footsteps approach Flagstaff snaps the SHOTGUN closed and
turns around to see

-ALBUQUERQUE standing with his hands over his head FLANKED
by WICHITA and STILLWATER who have two SHOTGUNS at the
ready Flagstaff is STUNNED and secretly THRILLED to see the
girls

FLAGSTAFF
No
ALBUQUERQUE
Yes
FLAGSTAFF
(to Stillwater re shotguns)
No
STILLWATER
Yes

Wichita holds her hand out in front of Albuquerque Without
even questioning it this time he pulls out the KEYS to the
YUKON and places them on her palm

Armed with the keys Wichita and Stillwater walk past
Flagstaff on either side

FLAGSTAFF
(to Wichita)
Noooo
99

She pauses smiles and KISSES him on the CHEEK

WICHITA
Yes

As the girls walk off Flagstaff shakes his head smirks and
calls over their shoulders

FLAGSTAFF
You’ve just survived an attack by
vicious vomiting monsters Where you
gonna go

STILLWATER
I’m going to Disneyland

EXT MINI-MART - MOMENTS LATER

ALBUQUERQUE and FLAGSTAFF stand by their duffel bag and
roller suitcase respectively They stare helplessly as
WICHITA and STILLWATER load the last of their own GEAR into
the DENALI shut the doors and PULL AWAY Deja Vu all over
again

Albuquerque and Flagstaff watch as their new nemeses
literally drive off into the SUNSET

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
This land is your land This land is my
land This land is Zombieland Full of
death and disappointment But never
despair ‘Cause when life gives you
flesh-eating monsters

Suddenly when the DENALI is forty yards away its BRAKE
LIGHTS come on and it STOPS The passenger door OPENS
Stillwater gets out cocks her arm like Tom Brady and THROWS
a small pellet-shaped object at Albuquerque in a high ARC

A PERFECT STRIKE Albuquerque makes a one-handed CATCH and
LOOKS to see what he’s holding A TWINKIE

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
-sometimes a little hope is all you
need

Stillwater climbs into the Escalade and it drives off
Albuquerque unwraps his Twinkie smells it adoringly and
takes a BITE Flagstaff watches staring into the sunset

FLAGSTAFF (VO)
That face Thats me making plans to go
ride the Matterhorn
In the meantime remember cardio
seatbelts and - this has nothing to do
with anything - but a little sunscreen
never hurt anyone Im Flagstaff
Arizona from Zombieland saying
goodnight

FADE TO BLACK

The music over the END CREDITS is ‘THIS LAND IS YOUR
