Blackness Then a hint of green becomes EARTH It lies across
an expanse of space Richly colored Fertile

A GIGANTIC ASTEROID cuts into frame Burning into EARTHS
ATMOSPHERE and striking down in the currant area of Guzumel
Mexico

VOICE
An impact equivalent to ten thousand
nuclear weapons detonating
simultaneously

A HUGE DINOSAUR FOOT steps down hard and is VAPORIZED with a
deafening ROAR

VOICE
One hundred trillion tons of dirt
and rock hurled into the atmosphere

EARTH seen from space is rocked with an IMMENSE SHOCKWAVE
A SHEET OF DEBRIS washes across the North and South
Hemispheres

VOICE
A blanket of dust the sun is powerless
to penetrate For five thousand years
our world is robbed of light as a
nuclear winter falls In that
darkness a civilisation is removed
from existence

EARTH is now completely entombed in a dark cold hell Letters
push towards us--

Okay Houston commence whacking

Okay guys one of the worst days in
NASA history just got worse Ten
million to one A rogue comet came
from deep space and collided with an
asteroid Some kids actually got a
picture of the collision event and
told no one The stuff that hit this
morning was the collisions forward-
thrown matter mere pebbles from
whats about to come Walter

mile one that obliterated the
dinosaurs

Dan were all here Tell us what
were up against

GOLDEN (VO)
In its simplest terms The end of
Mankind One asteroid one mile wide
or bigger impacts the Earth with
the equivalent force of all the
nuclear weapons in the world times
a thousand Half our population will
die within 24 hours from tidal waves
and heat pulses The other half wont
be so lucky In the end it will be
men eating the flesh of other men

(beat)

Its not the end of the world
General the world -Earth - will
still be here But there will be no
life - maybe cockroaches and some
resilient strands of bacteria

TEMPLE
Well thats really positive Dan
The President just got off the phone
with the Russians Theyre just about
to launch a new Mars Probe on the
biggest rocket in the world

Golden and the NASA BRASS exchange sceptical looks

GOLDEN (VO)
With the worst guidance system in
the world Their Mars Probe in 96
was found by a pygmy tribe in Africa

TEMPLE
Theyre going to pull off the probe
and replace it with four Atlas Class
IV nuclear warheads Enough punch in
their opinion - not to break it up -
but to slow it down enough to miss
Earths orbit

GOLDEN (VO)
Their launch date is set for next
month

TEMPLE
Theyre going to move it up

GOLDEN (VO)
To when

TEMPLE
Sixteen hours from now
All the NASA Technicians CLAMOR at once

GOLDEN (VO)
What are they gonna do glue spit
and scotch tape it together Even if
they get a nuke out to the asteroid
a surface nuclear detonation is not
going to work The only way is to
split the thing in half and hope the
two pieces slide past us

TEMPLE
Thank you for bringing up the
impossible Dan

COLINSWOOD
People the Presidents joining us
Mr President

PRESIDENT (VO)
Well this has been a tough day The
medias all over this Theyre going
to get nothing Telling the public
we might all be dead in eighteen
days achieves nothing but panic

GOLDEN (VO)
Mr President finding this speck in
the sky is a very hard thing to do
unless you have the exact co-
ordinates There are only twelve
telescopes powerful enough to see it
right now Youve got a full moon
goin for four days - makes it all
but impossible to see Once these
things draw closer to Earth youll
never keep a lid on this No way

EXT ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE

Harry crawls out of the hole

The nuke is at the bottom of the hole Harry runs gasping

for air bounding across the asteroid surface dodging geysers
and rolling debris
He dives for the detonator He stares long and hard A TEAR
wells in his eye His finger presses on the detonatorsweat
pours over his face

detonator

THRUSTERS jamming it as hard as it will gothe flames
bite up at them The shuttle veers off toward Earth

AJ and the others stare out the cockpit window as the
NUCLEAR FISSION EXPLOSION FLAMES OUT the halves of the
asteroid wing off

Among the masses Chick catches sight of Denise Tommy stands

Grace runs toward AJ he sees her and runs to her

They fall into each others arms Grace is crying AJ is
crying They kiss AJ looks up at the sky

AJ

AJ pulls out one of the DIAMONDS from the asteroid surface
as big as a doorknob about two thousand karats It glitters
in the sunlight Grace stares at it agog

As we PULL BACK and CAMERA TILTS TO THE SKIES ABOVE

Where Harry Stampers soul remains
