INT FIELD HOSPITAL TENT - DAY

A black screen

The sound of a knife cutting through boot leather
Fade in on the waists of two men (THE SURGEONS)
around a crude operating table

In the extreme background TWO STRETCHER BEARERS are
leaving

SURGEON 1 (0S)
Is this the last one

One of the bearers stops and looks back His face is
And he nods hollowly
We cannot see the patient stretched out on the table
do see that the first surgeon has succeeded in getting
mans boot off
SURGEON 2 (0S)
God what a mess at least theres
no gangrene

SURGEON 2 (0S)

Well I cant saw if I cant keep my

eyes open Lets coffee up he

can wait a few more minutes
As the TWO SURGEONS duck through a tent flap in the
we see a mangled foot torn by shrapnel it oozes blood
a cut clear to the bone
LIEUTENANT JOHN J DUNBARS eyes are now open Hes a
man his features sharp and handsome With effort he
his head and searches the room

His eyes come to rest on the form of a legless man

bloodsoaked sheets Hes whimpering like a child

Dunbar comes to a sitting position on the operating

As his eyes move around the room they come to rest on a
filled with the boots of men who have lost their legs
A cane travels through space and deftly hooks one of
boots

Lieutenant Dunbar brings the boot onto the operating

He tries to pull it on his mangled foot but the pain

him cry out Deliberately he breaks the cane and sticks

piece of it between his teeth

Tears of pain are rolling down his face A sweat has
out on his forehead and with great determination he
the boot on

EXT FIELD HOSPITAL TENT - DAY

The two weary surgeons sip on steaming mugs of coffee

white coats spattered with blood Their brief respite
interrupted by the sound of a muffled scream
Together they turn and rush back into the tent
INT FIELD HOSPITAL TENT - DAY

The operating table is empty save the broken cane and a

small

pool of blood Dunbar is gone

LEGEND ST DAVIDS FIELD TENNESSEE - 1862

EXT CIVIL WAR HILL - DAY

In a natural valley below is a peaceful field And on
either

side of the field seperated by a hundred yards of
green

are low rock walls

Several dairy cows are lying dead in the field

A group of MOUNTED UNION OFFICERS ride onto the crest
of

the hill and look down at the field The distinguished
man

with a long grey beard is GENERAL TIDE

EXT CONFEDERATE WALL - DAY

Ragged CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS crouch sullenly behind one
of

the walls

EXT UNION WALL - DAY

And just behind the other wall are UNION MEN better
equipped

perhaps but just as weary as their enemies

We hold on one man an enlisted soldier SERGEANT
PEPPER He

chances to glance behind and squints at a strange
sight

A solitary officer is standing a few feet behind him
The

sun is at his back giving him a ghostly feel Eerily
he

takes a step or two forward Hes limping badly

The sergeant recognizes him Its Dunbar
PEPPER
Lieutenant izat you

Dunbar says nothing He just stands and stares It

unnerves
the sergeant
PEPPER
Whatre you doing here lieutenant
DUNBAR
This is where I belong this is my
outfit
The sergeant stares at Dunbars foot
PEPPER
You went to hospital
DUNBAR
It was no good whats going on
here
A ping of riflefire flies overhead and the sergeant
dives
for the wall He calls over his shoulder
PEPPER
Better come to cover lieutenant
those boys are shooters
Dunbar settles next to the sergeant
PEPPER
Whats goin on here seems to be
the question alright you could
ask the major but he dont know
Hes busy tryin to figger out how
come the officers mess run outta
peach ice cream
The sergeant nods at the distant hill and Dunbar looks
too

PEPPER
Generals come up to see the show
but all he knows is there aint no
show

Now he nods toward the trees behind them and the
lieutenant

of material attached to a gondola
PEPPER

We started a balloon up but they

shot her down fore she was ten feet

off the ground so nobodys made a

run either way Its been a stand-

off all damn day and now the

major hes lookin at the general

and hes thinkin I better do

somethin and you know what that

means
More riflefire comes in and some of the union men
with a few rounds of their own The sergeant watches
confederate line across the field through a crack in
wall
Lieutenant Dunbar is not watching the enemy Hes
some horses picketed in the trees behind the union

Theres a nice bay Theres a big roan

PEPPER

Theyre sposed to be beat up just

like us but everybody knows that

Tuckers men are tough as cobs I

sure dont wanna die out there with

them cows
Dunbar is still watching the horses Hes holding on a
well-muscled buckskin standing a little apart from the
CISCO

Now he moves away from the wall heading for the

The sergeant squeezes off a shot Squinting across the
he sees a rifle with a hat on the tip of its bayonet
at him disrespectfully The sergeant rolls on his side

PEPPER

Some of the boys are sayin that if

we aint gonna fight we could just

settle the whole business with a

little high stakes poker Wouldnt

that be a sight a bunch of fellas

sittin in the middle of this field

drawin cards
The sergeants chatter is interrupted by a sound the
of hoofbeats rushing in behind him Men on either side
scattering but theres no time for the sergeant He
to the sound and cringes against the wall as the
belly of a horse soars over his head
Dunbar and his horse hit the ground with a thud and dig
the confederate line
EXT CONFEDERATE LINE - DAY

Some of the confederate riflemen can see the wild rider

for their lines A sharpshooter (RAY) calls over his

Tucker
A man in a slouch hat crowned by a jaunty feather looks
from an impromptu meeting TUCKER
EXT CIVIL WAR HILL - DAY
Like the others General Tide is absorbed with the
of a single horseman riding into the teeth of the

Tide lowers the telescope glances at the aide and
back down at the field

TIDE
Looks like a suicide

EXT BATTLEFIELD - DAY

Dunbar can see the confederate riflemen now Theyre
up behind the wall to aim and fire

Fifty yards from the enemy line hes still unhit He
the buckskin into a sharp left turn and they streak
to the confederate flank The buckskin is charging
heels throwing out clumps of dirt

The firing is tremendous The lieutenants hat is torn
A slug lifts off one of the officers epaulettes but
no bullet finds him

EXT UNION WALL - DAY

The entire union line is standing strangely quiet in
disbelief

EXT BATTLEFIELD - DAY

The lieutenant passes the last of the riflemen and
buckskin up at the far end of the field The little
pitching and rearing ready for another run

The lieutenant bows his head in exhaustion but a sound
across the field brings his head up quickly A great
is rolling along the union line

Theres action along the confederate line The men

Tucker is moving along the line The battle ground has
suddenly taken on a festival atmosphere and Tucker
like it
CONFEDERATE
Come on you son of a bitch -- you
wont make it a second time

EXT BATTLEFIELD - DAY

DUNBAR
Alright by me

Dunbar gazes down along his leg Blood is pumping from
wound

DUNBAR
Forgive me Father

Again he digs his heels into the buckskins flanks and
fly down the line The confederates are trying to

few are able to get off a hasty shot but theyre all
late

Dunbar swerves in a little closer to the wall as he

the barrel of his gun THUD a rifle ball buries
Rays forehead

EXT BATTLEFIELD - DAY

The union trooper who fired the fatal shot gets up from

kneeling position and scrambles after some of his

EXT UNION WALL - DAY

With his aides coming behind General Tide leaps his
over the wall at a dead run

The entire Union line pours after him screaming a
battlecry in unison Pepper is one of the last to
over the wall

EXT BATTLEFIELD - DAY

The union troops have the rebels in full flight
them into the woods beyond the field

EXT BATTLEFIELD - DAY

Suddenly the field is quiet There is rifle fire in the
distance but otherwise everything is still The field

almost empty The three dead dairy cows are still

at one end of the field is a solitary buckskin horse
rider lies on the ground a foot hooked in one stirrup
The sound of mens voices is coming near Suddenly

Tide is peering down at him Dunbar stares back glassy

DUNBAR
Dont take off my foot

General Tide stares down into Dunbars blank face He
next to the lieutenant and bends to whisper in his ear
GENERAL TIDE
You rest easy son youll keep

youll keep it

The general looks up at one of his aides

GENERAL TIDE
Bring up my ambulance

AIDE
Sir

GENERAL TIDE

Bring up my ambulance And bring my

surgeon with it Weve got an officer

whos worth something lying here
The aide dashes off to do what hes told as General
gently removes Dunbars foot from the stirrup and lays
carefully on the ground The image fades out
EXT PRAIRIE - DAY
The image of a boot fades in pull back to see that a

rider is coming toward us He has had a long and dusty

Its Lieutenant Dunbar Hes still riding the little

Dunbar starts forward and the camera swings around to
his back In the distance we can see an isolated and
military post

The sky is very blue The sun is bright A rough-hewn
unfenced fort is straight ahead

There are several miscellaneous stone structures a
stocked stable barracks officers quarters and in the
of it all a headquarters building

Lieutenant Dunbar riding straight and tall on his
built buckskin Cisco passes into view Hes headed
center of the fort

INT FORT HAYS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Silhouetted against the outside Lieutenant Dunbar

the wide doorway of headquarters We can hear the
sounds of work and life coming from the outside but in
its strangely quiet

A SERGEANT sits at a desk in the foyer Across the way
another desk is an enlisted CLERK Both men glance
their paperwork at the man in the doorway But its
glance and they go right on shuffling paper

Footfalls sound in a hallway and a blue-eyed officer

slick black hair swings into the foyer He too has a
slackness that echoes the dreariness of this post

The blue-eyed officer LIEUTENANT ELGIN and Dunbar
the doorway Dunbar glances down at a scrap of paper in
hand

DUNBAR
Where can I find Major Fambrough
ELGIN

Turn right all the way to the end

of the hall

Being roughly the same age and rank these two might

idle
awhile but Dunbar is eager Hes already moving

Dunbar stops and turns peering down the hallway No

there
INT FAMBROUGHS OFFICE - DAY
Sitting behind the desk holding a set of orders is
MAJOR
FAMBROUGH
FAMBROUGH
Lt John J Dunbar
Lt Dunbar is standing in front of the desk
DUNBAR
Yes sir
FAMBROUGH

DUNBAR
Excuse me
FAMBROUGH

Your orders say you are to be posted
on the frontier The frontier is
Indian country I quickly deduced
that you are an Indian fighter

FAMBROUGH
I did not ascend to this position by
being stupid

DUNBAR
No sir

Fambrough returns to the order Dunbar watches him in

The majors tunic is covered with food stains Sweat
broken out all over his head His grooming is awful
hands are trembling slightly Something is very wrong
him

Now the major sees something on the official paper He
quickly at the lieutenant then back at the paper

his lips but making no sound

FAMBROUGH
It says here youve been decorated

DUNBAR
Yes sir
FAMBROUGH
And they sent you out here to be
posted
DUNBAR
Actually sir Im here at my own
request I want to see the frontier
FAMBROUGH

Yes sir before its gone

The major fixes Dunbar with a sly look

FAMBROUGH

Still sly Fambrough digs into a side drawer There is
distinct clink of glass on glass as he rummages Now
has what he wants a blank official form He begins to
it out writing in a disturbingly childish way

FAMBROUGH
Sir Knight I am sending you on a
knights errand You will report to
Captain Cargill at the furthermost
outpost of the realm Fort
Sedgewick

He looks over his work with a schoolboys excitement
affixes his signature with a wild flourish

FAMBROUGH
My personal seal will assure you
safe passage through many miles of
wild hostile country

He folds the order and hands it to Dunbar

DUNBAR
Im wondering sir how will I be
getting there

FAMBROUGH
You think I dont know

DUNBAR
No sir its just that I dont know

FAMBROUGH
Hold your tongue

The major turns in his chair to stare through a single
window He can see a teamster outside tying down
a heavily-loaded wagon

FAMBROUGH
Im in a generous mood and will grant
your boon You see that peasant

desk Theres a large dark splotch on the majors
front
He jams both of his hands into the front of his pants
giggles
FAMBROUGH

I just pissed in my pants and

nobody can do anything about it
EXT FORT HAYS - DAY
Lieutenant Dunbar skips down the steps picks up
reins and starts leading the buckskin along the front
building He looks briefly at his orders stops and
back towards Fambroughs office
And there is Fambrough with a full glass of booze in
toasting the young lieutenant from the window A wide
on his face

EXT FORT HAYS - DAY

A wagon is pulling slowly away from the lonely

Now he looks both ways as if preparing to cross a busy
street Seeing that the coast is clear he minces into

parade ground in front of headquarters The plume is
in the breeze and the major carries something in each
an officers sword and a revolver

Except for these items the unfortunate major is naked
As he trots onto the parade ground Fambrough is

find that Elgin is following him He begins to run

Fambrough halts near the center of the parade ground
turns back on the lieutenant and waves his pistol
FAMBROUGH
Noooo noooo

ELGIN
Its alright Major

Now Elgin sees a GRIZZLED SERGEANT approaching
from the opposite direction
SERGEANT
Leave him alone lieutenant hes
cracked
Fambrough turns on the voice behind him and waves his

at the sergeant

FAMBROUGH
Nooo nooo

But Fambrough finds himself staring at the barrel of
sergeants raised pistol

ELGIN

But the lieutenant keeps his hand held out Fambrough
him silently Then he screws up his face like a
FAMBROUGH
The king is dead long live the

In one swift motion Fambrough brings the revolver up
swallows the barrel and pulls the trigger

EXT WAGON - DAY

At the sound of a single shot behind him Dunbar twists
on the wagon seat Seeing nothing he turns back to
front and takes stock of the driver TIMMONS He

like what he sees or smells

Timmons is not what would be called a credit to his

If all teamsters were greaseballs he would be their
ruler His stink must be incredible He leans over the

of the wagon and hocks out a disgusting stream of

Afternoon shadows are slanting across the rolling ocean

EXT CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

Dunbar sits at the fire watching the star burn out
Timmons is bending over the fire He farts then turns
Dunbar with a smile good one huh

He spits for good measure and for Dunbar the moment is
broken but not forgotten

DUNBAR (V0O)
Were it not for my companion I believe
I would be having the time of my
life He is quite possibly the foulest
person I have ever met
Looking over his shoulder at the journal we see that
latest entry is one of many and Dunbar is embellishing

with a drawing of a star

EXT PRAIRIE - DAY
Dunbar is off the seat riding atop the mountain of
He is writing in his journal
DUNBAR (V0O)
We have been gone four days now and
still we have seen no signs of life
Only earth and sky

Dunbar stops his writing

Timmons slows the wagon and stops He has seen

TIMMONS
Look yonder

EXT PRAIRIE - DAY
A cluster of bones bleached white are lying in the
grass Human bones Dunbar is squatting next to them
head dips into view over his shoulder and the
mouth splits into a toothless grin

TIMMONS

Somebody back east is sayin
dont he write Stupid bastard

why

The teamster spits and starts for the wagon Dunbar

his feet and examines the burnt out remains of a wagon
he finds an arrow in the grassy wheel Looking off he
only guess at the drama here The sun is sinking fast
the great expanse of prairie

EXT SEDGEWICK BLUFF - DAWN

A hatless soldier in a tattered overcoat CAPTAIN

is on the bluff staring morosely through his telescope
hand rubs a sore spot on his jaw He sticks the

his overcoat pocket He wedges a hand into his mouth

wiggles a loose tooth He gives it a tug but it is not

to come out
The breeze is coming up and Captain Cargill pulls his

overcoat
closed As he slips his last button through the hole
it
breaks off bounces off of his foot and rolls a few
feet
down the bluff
Captain Cargill watches the button forlornly making no
move
to go after it He raises his head once more and looks
to
the east Nothing is out there
EXT SEDGEWICK CUT BANK - DAWN
Cargill is walking along the base of the cut bank He
stops
staring up at a series of holes dug into the bluff
Their
entrance covered with found draperies of all
description
He works up the courage to call out
CARGILL
Corporal Guest Corporal Guest
Corporal Guest Corporal Guest you
dont have to talk to me just
please come out
At last theres some real movement behind one of the
holes
and CORPORAL GUEST crawls through one of the curtains
He
neither salutes nor speaks He blinks down at Cargill
looking
more like a hobo than a soldier
CARGILL
Its the end assemble the men in
front of my quarters
EXT CARGILLS QUARTERS - DAY
The MEN have lined up in front of Cargills sad sod
hut

others deserted You stayed on the
promise that the army would resupply
us Ive looked for that wagon from
Fort Hays just as you have day
after miserable day All can say

is that Im proud of you Get your
things men were leaving this place
The army can go to hell

The zombie troops have already broken ranks lurching
to their holes and gear like a gang of drunks

Cargill walks out of frame to reveal the broken down
that hangs askew above his quarters Fort Sedgewick
EXT SEDGEWICK BLUFF - DUSK

A solitary WOLF trots along the top of a bluff

the river He has two white socks running up his front
An old jagged scar cuts across his muzzle Hes

ruins of Fort Sedgewick

The little band of troops all on foot with their two
horses trailing behind are fading in the distance
EXT WAGON CAMP - DAWN

The wagon is parked in a shallow depression its team
unhitched Under the wagon the forms of two men lay

up in blankets

Several buzzards are settling on a half-butchered
Its one of the animals that was with Cargills

can hear men singing The shaky little column from Fort
Sedgewick is marching east for Fort Hays

EXT PRAIRIE - DAY
Dunbar is walking through a little valley of tall rich
The wagon is nowhere in sight

He looks back at Cisco who is also wandering by himself
searching for prime shoots

Timmons wagon comes into view now

DUNBAR
How come we havent seen any buffalo

TIMMONS
Cant figger the stinkin buffalo
Sometimes you dont see em for days
sometimes theyre thick as curls on
a whore

DUNBAR
What about Indians

TIMMONS
Goddamn Indians youd jus as soon

Nothing but thieves and beggars

Timmons as usual laughs at his own imagined wit

his head up at the sound and so does Cisco
Now theres a sudden lifting of the breeze It sweeps

The larks sad call and the sudden violent movement of
wind sends a shudder through Lieutenant Dunbar He

horizon in all directions aware all at once of his

He flips the reins over Ciscos neck and sticks a foot
the stirrup

Dunbar heads for the ridge

EXT BLUFF - DAY

As Dunbar comes over the hill he sees the wagon has
to a stop

The wagon has paused at the edge of a bluff Dunbar and
Timmons are peering into the little valley below

TIMMONS
Not what youd call a going concern

The wagon lurches over the edge of the bluff and down
see the pathetic remains of Fort Sedgewick

EXT SEDGEWICK - DAY

A full view of the deserted fort Timmons sits on the
by himself

TIMMONS
Aint nothin here lieutenant

Dunbar appears from Cargills former quarters

TIMMONS (0S)
Everybodys run off or got kilt
The lieutenant looks briefly at Timmons and marches

over to
the caved-in supply house Again he ducks inside
Dunbar emerges from the supply house and stares up at
the
wagon driver
DUNBAR
Alrightlets unload the wagon
TIMMONS

Dunbar moves around to the back of the wagon
TIMMONS

might as well turn around and get
started back
DUNBAR
This is my post

of his hand is dropping lightly on the butt of a long
revolver

at his hip

Timmons clucks to his team and the wagon pulls out The
on the prairie is fading fast
EXT SEDGEWICK RIVER BANK - DUSK
The wolf with two socks is patrolling along the edge of
river
INT QUARTERS - NIGHT
A lamp turns up casting a glow over Dunbars
cramped quarters
He adjusts the lamp and sits back on the bunk his
on his lap He begins an entry
DUNBAR (V0O)

Have arrived to find Fort Sedgewick

deserted Am now waiting for the

garrisons return or word from

headquarters Post is in exceedingly

poor condition Have decided to assign

myself clean-up duty beginning
tomorrow Supplies abundant The
country is everything I dreamed it
would be There can be no place like
this on earth

Dunbar signs the entry yawns contentedly and reaches

to

turn down the lamp

A wolf howls somewhere outside Its low at first but
it

keeps on building At its height the howl sounds as
though

it is coming from something gigantic

Dunbar is still listening after its gone He hears
wood

snap in the direction of the river then all is quiet
again

Without hesitating he slips the big revolver out of
its

holster and cradling it like a teddy bear slips it
under

his blanket

The light is left blazing

EXT SEDGEWICK - DAWN

First light over the sad fort

INT QUARTERS - DAWN

Dunbar is sleeping quietly He opens his eyes and rears
his

head to get his bearings Then he flops back down and
shuts

his eyes hoping for more sleep
He hears two heavy footfalls in rapid succession

Dunbar holds his breath staring at the doorway
Quietly he

pulls his gun aiming it directly at the doorway

Silence Suddenly a shadow starts across the

threshold

followed quickly by Ciscos big buckskin head The
horse

watches Dunbar a moment then looks curiously around

Dressed in pants old boots and a threadbare shirt
bangs home a nail on the sagging corral gate He tests
gates swing and satisfied with this he latches it
Cisco inside

The lieutenant picks up a water bucket and we follow as

walks the few quick yards it takes to reach the bank
overlooking the river

When he sees what lies along the slope below he stops
this spot just below the fort a garbage dump falls

the stream Old containers sacks rags trash

a thousand other miscellaneous scraps

The little boy races over to the old chief Kicking

makes a move to pull him back but Ten Bears indicates
the

boy should stay

No no let him sit with me

There is silence as the two men settle themselves by

the

TEN BEARS
Our country seems good this summer
but I have not been out to see it

KICKING BIRD

Yes it is good The grass is rich
The game is plenty and not running
away

TEN BEARS

am glad to hear it But the buffalo
are late I always worry about the
bellies of our children

A brief silence

KICKING BIRD
was thinking of a dance

TEN BEARS
Yes a dance is always a good idea
t would be good to have a strong

sign

Kicking Bird seems suddenly uncomfortable The little
boy
leaves

KICKING BIRD
Yes

TEN BEARS
Theres a funny thing about signs
They are always flying in our faces
We know when they are bad or good
but sometimes they are strange and
there is no way to understand them
Sometimes they make people crazy but
a smart man will take such a sign
into himself and let it run around
for two or three days If he is still
confused he will tell somebody He
might come to you or to me and tell
it A smart man always does that

Ten Bears picks up the pipe and puffs away seemingly
without
care

KICKING BIRD
I have seen such a sign

Crowded around them in a high state of excitement are

KICKING BIRD
He might be a god or he might be a
special chief -- thats why we are
thinking of having a talk with him

There is a little murmuring around the fire and it
silent Wind In His Hair rises to speak

WIND IN HIS HAIR
I do not care for this talk about a
white man Whatever kind of white
man he is he is not Sioux and that
makes him less Weve camped here
for ten days now and each day our
scouts find nothing One old bull

with wolves tearing him apart nothing
more We need meat -- not talk

KICKING BIRD
You are right we need meat today
and tomorrow But we must also have
meat in ten years

Kicking Bird pauses here Everyone is listening
attentively

KICKING BIRD
But the whites are coming Our friends
the Shoshone and the Kiowa even our
enemies agree on this -- the whites
are coming More than can be counted

WIND IN HIS HAIR
Kicking Bird is always looking ahead
and that is good But when I hear
that more whites are coming -- more
than can be counted I want to laugh
We took a hundred horses from these
people there was no honor in it
They dont ride well they dont
shoot well theyre dirty They have
no women no children They could
not even make it through one winter
in our country And these people are
said to flourish I think they will
all be dead in ten years

There is a surge of enthusiasm in the lodge and Wind In
His
Hair is riding the crest of it

WIND IN HIS HAIR
I think this white man is probably
lost

This parting shot prompts a good-natured round of
laughter

KICKING BIRD
Wind In His Hair has spoken straight
his words are strong and I have heard
them Its true the whites are a
poor race and its hard to understand
them But when I see one white man
alone without fear in our country
around

are

I do not think he is lost I think

he may have medicine I see someone
who might speak for all the white
people who are coming I think this
is a person with which treaties might
be struck

WIND IN HIS HAIR

This white man cannot cover our

lodges

or string our bows or feed

our children I will take some good
men there are many here tonight

We will

ride to the soldier fort we

will shoot some arrows into this
white man If he truly has medicine
he will not be hurt If he has no
medicine he will be dead

This is the best idea so far and there is much talk

how he will be But I know this

Her hands are folded on her lap A blood-stained knife
held between them She has ritually slashed her arms
cuts are not deep -- but all are running with blood
pours from a deep cut in her thigh

She lets her song fade to nothing and bows her head

to her thigh Suddenly shes alert Stands With A Fist

The gleaming buckskin horse is standing thirty or forty
behind her on the top of the knoll A white soldier is
on the horse A white soldier with a sword a bright
and a red sash And most amazing of all no face

A shift in the breeze has wrapped the popping red

trying to claw it away from his face

I am in agreement with Kicking Bird
We will go down and talk to the white

If this council decides to talk with

Kicking Bird stops himself he knows this must be hard

brings her green eyes to bear on the medicine man

KICKING BIRD
We have word from many places that

He pauses

KICKING BIRD
They are coming into everyones

calls himself loo ten tant I have
visited him and believe his heart

I am afraid that he will tell some
whites that I am here I am afraid
that they will try to take me away

Every warrior in camp would fight
them if they tried

defeatist
she lowers her eyes once more

Stands With A Fist is tearing through the thick willows
growing alongside the river Shes crying her heart

out

EXT RIVER - DAY

The big cry is over but Stands With A Fist is still
sniffling

as she emerges on a little patch of beach-next to the
river

She sits herself down under a cottonwood and looks
hollowly

at the surface of the water in front of her

Somewhere in the distance is the sound of many drums
witha

sigh she drops her head

Then as if shocked by some unseen force her eyes
spring

open Wide and unblinking her eyes stare deeply into
space

Someone is calling The voice is so faint at first that
the

word cant be heard But the calling grows and suddenly
the

word is upon her

EXT PRAIRIE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

A little girl of seven CHRISTINE is lying in the
grass of

a sod roof Next to her is ten year-old WILLIE They
are

planning their wedding and staring up at the sky

Like many youngsters shes not eager to heed the
persistent

call of her mother

MOTHER (0S)
Christine where are you

Reluctantly the little girl gets up and looks over the

edge
of the roof to see her mother holding yet another
child She
seems anxious
CHRISTINE
Im right here mother
MOTHER
Get inside both of you
CHRISTINE
Why
MOTHER
Just do what I oh God Stay where
you are Keep down do you hear me
FOUR PAWNEE are riding up in the background TWO MEN
are
moving out to meet them
CHRISTINE
Who is it Willie
Willie is peeking over the edge of the roof An old
muzzle-
loading rifle is by his side He whispers to her
WILLIE
They look like Pawnee my father
and your father are talking to them
Down in the yard out beyond a rough table set with the
leavings of a Sunday dinner two white men on foot are
talking
to the four mounted Pawnee warriors
Its an argument As a baby cries somewhere inside the
house
the two white men sign the Indians to go away The
Pawnee
make no move to go however and with their patience at
an

end the two white men turn back to the house

He gives her a hard shove which sends her rolling down

Christine runs past the point where the roof meets the
hillside and down into the draw Shes running toward
the background we can see Willie on the edge of the
aiming his squirrel gun into the yard He fires once

grasping the gun like a club he leaps off the roof and
disappears

Christine never looks back She runs up the draw as
her skinny young legs can carry her

The moon is full As we look down on the fort we can
new sound coming off the prairie A light rumbling
INT QUARTERS - NIGHT
Lieutenant Dunbar is asleep in the moonlight The
is getting louder It wakes him He gropes about

lantern and listens to the strange powerful sound

Somethings in the air He holds the lantern toward the
ceiling Particles of dirt and dust are being shaken

the roof Its the earth thats trembling

EXT SEDGEWICK - NIGHT

Dressed in only pants and boots Dunbar walks along the
above the river his lantern held out in front of him
sound is tremendous now Dunbar stops as a great wall
dust rises before him

At the same time he realizes something is alive behind

wall of dust he recognizes the sound the sound of
thousands of hoofbeats

He sees one veer out And now another And another

briefly from the great cloud of dust The most powerful
on the prairie now seems like the most powerful force

on

earth as it thunders by

The buffalo

EXT PRAIRIE - NIGHT

Dunbar and Cisco are running flat out in the moonlight

EXT INDIAN VILLAGE - NIGHT

The village is coming up A great fire is blazing at
the far

end Horse and rider speed past the first lodge

Its an important mission for the lieutenant As he
gallops

through the village he says one word over and over
trying

to remember the correct pronunciation Its the Sioux
word

for buffalo

EXT FIRE - NIGHT

Everyone has gathered around the great blaze In the
center

of the circle close to the fire the buffalo men are
dancing

Others are dancing too The music is very loud

The little buckskin is out of his head with speed He
doesnt

answer the bit when Dunbar first tries to pull him up

People scatter in all directions as Dunbar and Cisco
charge

into their midst

Dunbar pulls back with all his might and the buckskin
sits

down Hes wet from his long ride and Dunbar cant
stay on

his back As Cisco rears he slides off and tumbles
onto his

back

Angry warriors pile on top of him Dunbar shouts out
the

word for buffalo yelling it over and over as the
warriors
pummel him

So many men have rushed into the fray that none can
deal the

lieutenant a decisive blow They roll about in the
dust

Just as Dunbars cries have begun to lose their
strength he

feels a sudden lessening of the weight upon him

As the men pile off Dunbar is left flat on his back

His

lip is split and blood is streaming from his nose

Hes looking into a familiar face The mans head is
covered

with the full skin and feathers of an eagle Kicking

Through her tangled hair Stands With A Fist watches

Dunbar and Kicking Bird are riding together at the

Ten Bears entourage

Far in the distance the lieutenant sees something

on the prairie pink bumps are dotting the landscape

ahead And black specks are moving about on the bumps
EXT KILLING GROUND - DAY

Beneath droves of scavenging black birds lies the body

ofa

buffalo His hide has been peeled off and his tongue
has

been cut out The rest of his body has been left to rot
in

the sun

The column so noisy and happy before winds its way
through

the killing ground in silence There must be twenty-
five

buffalo like the one we saw close up all of them
stripped

and rotting

Dunbar looks queasy The lieutenant glances at the
medicine

man riding next to him Kicking Bird looks sick too
Dunbar

looks away The entire column is stretched along the
killing

ground looking

A naked cow covered with birds lies on her side Her
new

born calf doomed to death cries for his dead mother
And

next to the calf Dunbar sees something else He sees
wagon

tracks and the booted footprints of white men

The column is clear of the killing ground and heading
deeper

into the prairie They have left everything untouched

the temporary camp It looms ahead of them the hide-
lodges glowing like candles in the last light of day A
fire is blazing in the center of camp

Dunbar hangs back as the other riders go into the noisy
A special event of some kind is taking place As he

Back in the shadows behind the fire is a wagon

blonde and wavy Several of the other men have scalps
None of the hair is Indian

Dunbar can see into the wagonbed now A couple of dozen
buffalo hides are stacked in the wagonbed Its all
clear The white men who killed the buffalo for hides
tongues have themselves been killed

Dunbar slowly retreats into the shadows

EXT PRAIRIE - NIGHT

Cisco has been hobbled nearby and with the temporary
glowing on the plains a half-mile away Dunbar spreads
blanket on the open plain

The warrior swings his rifle into a shooting position
after some imaginary game and imitates the rifles

He stares down at Dunbar with a smile lifts his rifle
overhead and barks out a cry of victory

EXT TEMPORARY CAMP - DAY

The bands best hunters two dozen of them are making
to chase the buffalo Its the big time no event is

important The villagers -- mostly women children and
elderly -- have gathered around each of the hunters

The largest audience has gathered around Lieutenant

and Wind In His Hair Wind In His Hairs pony is ready
bolts of yellow lightning adorn his shoulders and rump
now the warrior is drawing the same design along

rump

Dunbar reads this correctly as a great honor and stands
silently Wind In His Hair is finished He looks at

and nods at the paint as if asking for a response

DUNBAR
I wish I knew what to say

A Sioux voice using english words sails out of the
of watchers

STANDS WITH A FIST
Say thank you

Startled the men turn to the sound The other Sioux are
stunned too

Its the first time weve seen the buffalo up close
fantastic creatures powerful brutish untameable

from another age A great bull turns away from the

and lifts his purple horned head to sniff the breeze

browsing

EXT PRAIRIE - DAY

The hunters are advancing across the prairie spreading
in a formation that will encircle part of the herd

The lightning bolts on Wind In His Hairs pony are in
Ciscos bolts are moving too

Theres a lump in Dunbars throat He knows nothing of
is expected of him but hes doing it anyway He glances
his right at Wind In His Hair and to his left at

Bird Theyre both concentrated on what lies ahead
From the corner of his eye he sees Kicking Bird look
The lieutenant looks too

Its a minor flap Three or four youngsters eager to
distinguish themselves have trailed too close to the

and are being turned back Dunbar recognizes one of
the boy who took charge of Cisco at the village

A strike far up on the horned formation Their ponies
forward The mad dash is on

Dunbars hat flies off at first spurt and now the

and his horse are hurling over the prairie The little
buckskin seems to know what is expected of him and has

every ounce of his muscle to speed Theyre burning up
ground

When Dunbar looks back over his shoulder hes shocked
find that the best buffalo ponies the Siouxs have are
behind He and Cisco are on their own

The herd is in full flight and the sound of their

is overwhelming The buffalo are very fast but Cisco is
gaining with every stride Theyve formed a great

wall in front of him and now Dunbar can see their rumps
tails and flying hooves
Dunbar takes a solid grip on his rifle and shuts his

if in prayer The sound of thousands of hooves is

Dunbar and Cisco have caught the buffalo A few more
and theyll be in

Dunbar and Cisco are running with the buffalo A shaggy
moves in and swipes at Cisco but the little horse is

quick and too smart He dodges away nearly dumping the
lieutenant in the process

Sioux hunters stream past him every man for himself
in on targets

Dunbar starts to dismount but something he sees stops

A hundred yards away a small hunter is after a handful
buffalo who have splintered off from the rest Its
Lot trying to make a kill of his own As Dunbar

the boys inexperienced horse shies away and bucks
the kid to the ground
A big bull breaks away from the splinter group lowers

head and charges

Dunbar kicks Cisco into a run spits a spare bullet

mouth and rams it into the chamber

Smiles A Lot is picking himself off the ground The

in full charge

Dunbar is riding with his knees Both hands are holding
rifle Hell never make it to the boy in time Hes got

The bullet plows home exploding the bulls heart The

scene of his humiliation

The sounds of approaching riders turns Dunbars

a different direction

The entire village is streaming onto the plains for the
butchering

The riders bearing down on him are being lead by Wind
Hair
Wind In His Hair jumps off his pony and

smiling

slaps Dunbars back with a good-natured blow of
congratulations

EXT PRAIRIE - DAY

The buffalo has been split open and Wind In His Hair
at the bulls side is feeling around in the cavity He
what hes looking for and gives it a jerk

Its the liver still warm and steaming He offers it
Dunbar but the lieutenant not having the faintest
only looks at it blankly

A sizable crowd has gathered to watch this ritual
Wind In His Hair sticks the fresh liver in his mouth
happily bites off a chunk letting the juices run from
edges of his mouth Now he figures the lieutenant knows

to do and hands the liver back to him

Shrill Sioux voices rise all around him as they cheer

lieutenant Dunbar holds the liver triumphantly over

EXT KILLING GROUND - DAY

Little butchering parties cluster around each fallen

EXT TEMPORARY CAMP - NIGHT

Flame begins to lick at each of the bodies and we match
dissolve -- the clusters of people have become groups
surrounding fires at the temporary camp

EXT FEASTING FIRE - NIGHT

All over camp people are crowding around fires

fresh meat Children are playing everywhere the dogs
having a field day with scraps and the voices of the
are happy

At a little distance we see Lieutenant Dunbar and Wind
His Hair excusing themselves from one of the fires
start toward us Wind In His Hair is sucking on a rib
and seems to show no sign of slowing down his

DUNBAR

He unbuttons the tunic

DUNBAR

He sloughs off the tunic and hands it over Wind In His

slips out of the magnificent bone-pipe breastplate hes
wearing and gives it to Dunbar as he wriggles into the

The fit is too tight the material too scratchy but
things are of little consequence to Wind In His Hair
loves the tunic

With urging signs he asks the lieutenant to put on the
breastplate Dunbar slips it over his head and Wind In

Hair helps him with the ties

Now its the lieutenants turn to be amazed The

as craftsmanship at its finest He runs his fingers
ridges of bone now covering him from neck to waist He
up at Wind In His Hair

The warrior nods approvingly as though a good deal has

Wind In His Hair grins He holds up a single finger

WIND IN HIS HAIR

One more eat
DUNBAR
I cant Im full very full

Still holding up the finger he guides Dunbar into the
firelight of the next party

Immediately men jump up to greet the celebrities
begin to saw off more meat

EXT FEASTING FIRE - NIGHT

As Dunbar gnaws on a rib he glances at the friendly
around the fire His eyes suddenly stop their roving
A BIG WARRIOR is wearing the military hat he lost on
hunt Its a little too big The brim touches the top
big warriors ears

Now the Big Warrior notices that Dunbar is staring at
Their eyes meet

DUNBAR
Thats my hat

At the sound of these words the cheerful talk around
fire begins to fade

Dunbar touches the top of his head and points to his

WIND IN HIS HAIR
You can see that he wants it now

The Big Warrior shakes his head He wont budge
WIND IN HIS HAIR
We all know that is a soldier hat
We all know who wears it If you
want to keep it thats alright But
give something for it

The other men around the fire murmur their assent The

Warrior thinks for a moment then abruptly gets to his

He looks at his waist and unfastens a knife ina

worked scabbard He tosses it across to Dunbar

The lieutenant examines the trade item a moment Now he
back at the big warrior A smile breaks slowly across

face and Dunbar nods At last he smiles back Its a

finds himself alone in the shadows still marveling at

EXT TEMPORARY CAMP - NIGHT

Wind In His Hair finishes sucking on the rib bone and
it to a dog thats been trailing him Kicking Bird is
toward him He notices the new tunic and gives wind In

Kicking Bird reaches out and feels the strange material

Dunbar peers around a lodge A group of young women are
dancing in a clockwise circle Their steps are light-
This is dancing purely for the fun of it

One of the young women spots him standing behind the
and theres a wave of shy giggling as news of loo ten
presence is passed along Embarrassed Dunbar starts
the fringe of the fires nodding politely to the women
goes

One has more courage than the others She breaks out
his hand and steers him gently into the dance circle
resistance he might have is buried by the girls

encouragement She keeps showing him the step and the
lieutenant tries to pick it up

The movement is simple and the music is mesmerizing
at first Dunbar quickly gets the hang of it In short

hes keeping up with the others And hes enjoying

Soon he has relaxed enough to shut his eyes carried
by the eternal sound of the drums He doesnt notice
the circle has begun to shrink There is a touch of the
in their eyes

He bumps into somebody and the woman behind bumps into
But the girls just laugh and so does Dunbar It was a

They asked me to dance

The medicine man says nothing

DUNBAR
I was just dancing

The lieutenant does a step or two trying to explain
that strange half-smile appears on Kicking Birds face
EXT KICKING BIRDS LODGE - NIGHT

Stands With A Fist has been watching everything from
tipi flap Now she ducks back inside

INT KICKING BIRDS LODGE - NIGHT

The fire is still burning in the center of the lodge
is sleeping soundly

Its not a moment later that we hear the soft sounds of
mumbling somewhere in the lodge Then its quiet

that mumbling again And now a womans giggle

Dunbar stirs waking and curious sits up a little and
across the fire There is movement on Kicking Birds
The medicine mans head and that of his wife come into
for a second or two before they sink back down into
The movements and sound that follow become more

Theyre having sex
Embarrassed the lieutenant averts his eyes they

Lieutenant Dunbar the sounds of lovemaking floating
over

him peers again in that direction only to meet the
smiling

eyes of Kicking Bird and his wife

Embarrassed again he stares open-eyed at the ceiling
He

looks like a man who knows something is happening but
doesnt

know what it is

Stands With A Fists eyes are open too She doesnt
move

EXT VILLAGE - DAWN

The faintest seam of light is starting to glow on the
eastern

horizon

EXT KICKING BIRDS LODGE - DAWN

The camera pans off the tipi to the eastern horizon

Its the pony herd And Dunbar is walking in that
direction

His feet leave a trail in the wet grass

First one then two then whole groups of ponies lift
their

heads and prick their ears at Dunbars approach

Dunbar walks to the edge of this great sea of horses
he

stops and gives a long whistle

A figure previously unseen sits up on the back of a
pony

EXT SEDGEWICK - DUSK
An escort of six warriors is galloping up the bluff to

Restlessly he walks to the doorway gazing out onto

then he spots something
EXT QUARTERS - DAY
A large prairie chicken is lying in front of the

Two Socks has taken his dinner and retreated to the
He munches contentedly until a strange sound jolts him

At the fort is an odd sight Dunbar is dancing around

Two Socks is caught up in the scene and lets out a howl

The silhouettes of three Indians are watching the

The wolf races away this time and Dunbar immediately
for Cisco hoping to reach his horse and ditch Two

But hes running long before the wolf comes bouncing
alongside Dunbar weaves out at him startling Two

sidles away but as he does the lieutenant reaches out
gives the base of his tail a good hard squeeze

It might as well be a firecracker Tow Socks gives a
and shoots off with his tail tucked Dunbar laughs out
He watches until the wolf has gone a fair distance
sign of slowing down

Then still chuckling to himself he turns once again
starts for Cisco at a trot But moments later

grabs at one of his ankles the lieutenants legs

he goes down face first into the grass

Dunbars lying on his belly Not knowing what hit him
rolls onto his side for a closer look Theres Two

Young mounted warriors have ridden out to swarm around

a brief tug of war But before it gets out of hand
Bird is reassuring Dunbar with calm words and a smile
the lieutenant watching the boy takes Ciscos muzzle
his hands and blows breath into each nostril He too
Dunbar a reassuring smile
In the next moment the lieutenant finds himself being

pushed into Kicking Birds lodge
As Kicking Bird is about to duck in behind him a hand

his arm stops him It is Wind In His Hair and his tone
is
strong with friendly advice

EXT VILLAGE - DAY

Kicking Bird and Dunbar are strolling through camp
engaged

in a real conversation Stands With A Fist is just
behind

them

DUNBAR (V0O)
I try to answer all of Kicking Birds
questions but I know he is frustrated
with me He always wants to know how
many more white people are coming I
tell him that it is impossible for
me to say When he persists I tell
him that the white people will most
likely pass through this country and
nothing more

Kicking Bird and Stands With A Fist are walking away
from

Dunbar who takes a few steps in the opposite direction
before
pausing Toward the end of the following speech he
glances

back at them and Stands With A Fist glances back at
him

DUNBAR (V0O)
But I am speaking to him in half-
truths One day there will be too
many but I cannot bring myself to
tell him that I am sure that Stands
With A Fist knows

His surroundings are completely Indian Dunbar is
cleaning
the big navy revolver

DUNBAR (V0O)
A war party is going against the
Pawnee soon and I have asked to go
I sensed that I have made a mistake
in doing so but I could not bring
myself to take it back They are my
friends and from what little I gather
the Pawnee have been very hard on
these people I hope I have not
overstepped my bounds

The lodge flap rustles and in comes Stands With A Fist
and

Kicking Bird Dunbar stands to greet them

DUNBAR
Im glad to see you please sit

Kicking Bird speaks and Stands With A Fist translates

STANDS WITH A FIST

Kicking Bird wants to know why you
want to make war on the Pawnee They
have done nothing to you

DUNBAR
They are Sioux enemies

STANDS WITH A FIST

began to speak about what was expected
of a Sioux husband my mind began to
swim in a way that shut out everything
but her The tiny details of her
costume The contours of her shape
The light in her eyes The smallness
of her feet I knew that the love

can see now that this remarkable place has been
desecrated

Trees have been felled everywhere most of them left to
for no explicable reason

At the same time he sees this destruction Dances With
realizes that the strange buzzing sound is not coming
overhead but from the forest floor

The insects are not bees They are flies and they are
over dozens of carcasses strewn over the ground
skunks squirrels and other small animals nearly all
them killed merely for target practice

The men and their ponies move on Deer carcasses are
everywhere many of them horribly mutilated A choice

the sacred rigging above an takes down a melon-sized

bundle He brings this back to the fire and unwraps it
Inside is a rusted hunk of metal the helmet of a

conquistador

time of my grandfathers grandfather
Eventually we drove them out Then

have been like all the others who
find something they want in our
country They take it without asking
I have always been a peaceful man
happy to be in my own country and
wanting nothing from the white people
Nothing at all But I think you are
right I think they will keep coming

bundle Our country is all that we
want We will fight to keep it

Several men are gathered around Ten Bears fire
Kicking Bird Wind In His Hair and Dances With Wolves
All the men are draped with blankets The wind is

outside The men are engaged in small talk as the pipe
around the circle

The pipe comes around to Dances With Wolves and the
man

next to him must nudge him to attention Dances With
Wolves

takes the pipe and begins to smoke

Ten Bears watches him closely

TEN BEARS
(to Dances With Wolves)
Dances With Wolves is quiet these
days

He does not reply He smokes a little more and passes
the

pipe

TEN BEARS
Is his heart bad

Dances With Wolves glances at the men around the fire

DANCES WITH WOLVES
Killing the soldiers at the river
was a good thing It made me free
and my heart was big to see my friends
coming to help me I did not mind
killing those men I was glad to do
it

He searches for the right words

DANCES WITH WOLVES
But the soldiers hate me now like
they hate no other I am more than
an enemy to them I am a traitor
They will hunt for me They will not
give up And when they find me they
find you and that cannot happen

Objections break out all around the fire Wind In His

jumps to his feet and even Kicking Bird is protesting

old chief A few snowflakes cling to his wispy hair

He goes straight to the fire and sits

Ahh this is a nice fire at my
age a good fire is better than

anything
Stands With A Fist brings two small bowls of food
them next to the men and busies herself with something

Though neither one is much interested they begin to

TEN BEARS
I wondered how your bad heart was
doing and though I would come by and
see for myself This place doesnt
look so bad-hearted

Dances With Wolves smiles

DANCES WITH WOLVES
No we are happy

TEN BEARS
But you are leaving anyway

DANCES WITH WOLVES

TEN BEARS
Have you told this to Kicking Bird
or to Wind In His Hair

Its anguish for Dances with Wolves to think about his

friends He shakes his head no Ten Bears thinks
again in

silence

TEN BEARS
You are the only white man I have
ever known I have thought about you
alot More than you know

DANCES WITH WOLVES
That does not surprise me

TEN BEARS
You have always spoken with your
heart And like all of us you area
free man and can do anything you
like When I look across this fire
I do not see a white soldier I see
only a Sioux named Dances With Wolves
And there is nothing they hate so
much as a Sioux

Like gunfighters the two men approach each other at a

Gradually they realize that each has selected the same
gift Its heartbreaking Kicking Bird tries to cover
casual question but its all fake
