“HAPPY END”

Michael Haneke
HAPPY END - Characters

Georges Laurent The Patriarch the last of a dying breed of provincial industrialists Sensing the
inevitability of the decline and the imminent end of the world as he knew it he is
under no illusions Georges knows he serves no useful purpose any longer He
would like to end life on his own terms but life refuses He is constantly returned
to where he belongs the existence he attempts to flee once and for all

Anne Laurent Georges daughter perspicacious and dynamic still in her late 50s For the survival
of the family business that she now heads Anne battles--and schemes--with
customers and bankers She has no known weakness Everything depends on her

Pierre Laurent Annes son and the Patriarchs grandson Pierre is a disappointment to his family
and his mother especially Destined by family tradition to run the firm he proves
incapable of doing so Anyway he is not interested He lets things run away from
him He is slack negligent and unloved

Thomas Laurent The Patriarchs son and Annes younger brother Thomas is also Pierres uncle but
he never sees his nephew anymore Thomas veered off his designated career path
long ago He wasnt cut out for business He has made his name however in
medicine Thomas is a womanizer Divorced from his first wife Nathalie with
whom he has a 13-year-old daughter Eve he remarried and is at the age of 50
the father of a baby boy

Nathalie Laurent First wife of prominent doctor Thomas and mother of Eve Nathalie drifts
through life trying in vain to be useful if only to her daughter Abandoned and
ineffectual Nathalie like many others is unable to overcome her depressive
tendencies
Anais Thomas second wife after Nathalie Anais is still deeply in love (despite Thomas
infidelities) Aged 35 she is also a kind and caring mother The others have little to
hold against her

The Gambist Thomas mistress Although invisible merely evoked or alluded to the Gambist is
in this story a bolt of eroticism Thomas is crazy about her body

Eve Thomas and Nathalies daughter was raised by her mother far from the Laurent
family She is 13 now Some aspects of her personality are still hazy but she
appears anxious unstable strangely cruel on occasion and perhaps even suicidal
just like her grandfather This final trait may provide her unwanted bond to the
family

Laurence Bratshow An English bank executive and Annes lover Although they rarely see each other
Anne relies on Laurence who plays only a fleeting part in proceedings

of the portable toilets placed there closing the door behind him The work continues for a
while Then unnoticed by those present the soil near the toilets breaks loose and as a
result one of the toilets slips to the edge of the trench wobbles and crashes into the trench
with a loud BANG rising above the construction noise The men working at the base of the
trench stop short at first they are unable to believe their ears but then they approach the

trench too evidently having been called over people approach the edge of the pit and
attempt cautiously to peer down into it

Scene 17
Construction site InteriorDay
Anne Pierre and three reps from the building regulation authority They are
inspecting the site of the accident in Scene 10 The toilets placed on the edge of the
construction pit are no longer there All around is noisy construction activity
PIERRE (irritated) they just put them here
OFFICIAL (with irony) on the edge

PIERRE They were behind the barrier Normally no-one would be stupid enough to
go to the toilet here

OFFICIAL Why not

PIERRE Because theyre at the back

OFFICIAL Who

PIERRE mean the toilets These ones here were just put there
temporarily in the morning so they could be brought down into the pit
because they dont have enough down there

OFFICIAL Why werent they brought down right away

PIERRE They were delivered first thing in the morning No-one was here yet to
open up down below So they left them here

OFFICIAL Behind the barrier on the edge of the pit
Pierre gestures in exasperation (Evidently)
OFFICIAL And why was nobody here yet

PIERRE (tetchily) Because the truck came before seven but the foreman only
arrives at seven because the barrier was checked at the end of the day and had
to stay late at the office yesterday and just for once showed up here later

Things like that can happen right

The official ironically mimics Pierres gesture from a moment ago (Evidently) Pierre
shakes his head in annoyance (Theres no talking to this man)

ANNE (to the official striving to calm things down) The previous evening we sat over
the weeks planning until long after midnight (Brief placatory gesture to Pierre who is
about to interrupt then back to the official) apologize Monsieur Van Thamen my
son is very affected by the incident It was obviously a chain of unfortunate events

OFFICIAL Certainly Madame
(to Pierre) Can you guarantee that the barrier was there The people who delivered
the toilets claim they didnt see it There were two of them sir

PIERRE How am supposed to guarantee that dont take photos of what
happens here every day If thats what theyre claiming then theyre lying
OFFICIAL If theres a prosecution - and thats pretty likely - its your word against
theirs Then youll have to prove it After all someone or other must have been on
the site before seven

SECOND OFFICIAL Ive spoken to people who claim the barrier was only put
back in place after the accident

PIERRE Whos saying that

SECOND OFFICIAL Some of your employees

PIERRE wonder who that was

ANNE Pierre please

PIERRE (tries to be calmer) It may be that the toilet ripped the barrier tape away
when it fell

After the accident we really had other things to do apart from checking that kind of
thing Im sorry

OFFICIAL When the accident happened was the safety officer there

PIERRE But told you - he was always there

OFFICIAL hope so for your sake Monsieur And for your foremans sake too
Where is he then

PIERRE We work shifts Its his day off today

OFFICIAL Well then

(he turns to his entourage) Gentlemen

(to Anne in a friendly manner) A pleasure Madame as always
(to Pierre) Monsieur

PIERRE (barely managing to conceal his irritation) Goodbye Monsieur (nods to
the others) Gentlemen

The gentlemen nod in response and go to their car Pierre turns away furiously and makes
to go to his office

ANNE Pierre

He stops Turns reluctantly towards her
ANNE Was that necessary

Pierre gestures again as before (Evidently)

meantime Eve has calmed down a little she rummages for a pack of paper tissues from the
school rucksack at her feet and blows her nose
Thomas does not know what to say Helplessly in a gesture of sympathy he strokes her
face with the back of his hand Eve shakes her head and glances at Thomas with a tense

Scene 20
Computer screen InteriorDay

(A few words regarding the translation in German and English words with a sexualobscene connotation are either
neutralized or literarized or simply denunciatory and vulgar In order to do justice to the realism of modern-day language
but also in order to avoid vulgarity in the three relevant scenes of this screenplay the French words are also
placed in brackets)

The first lines of the e-mail are already written ie fixed and the rest appears as it is typed
by way of accompaniment we hear the sound of fingers on the keyboard
(Beneath the lines of the new text at the beginning we read the very top lines of the e-mail to which a response is now being
written As each new line is written they disappear downwards out of the frame

this beautiful sophisticated woman who bewitches everyone can think of nothing apart from your body
gleaming so white on the sweat-drenched sheets

The text already written when cutting to the scene

lying on my back indolent and half asleep my hand between my legs dream of
what you did with me in that ugly room which was so beautiful because lay in your
arms wish you would destroy the porcelain doll that am

From here upon the beginning of the scene the text is then typed

and abase me that you would put it in my arse (cul) and fuck me (baise) until my
whole body is dripping with sweat to the point where one thinks one is dying you
know but you dont die your hand in mine that you would pee in my face smiling all
the while love your smile so much your hand in mine or that would do all that to
you or that both of us would do it all at the same time and all kinds of other things
too something crazy and

announcement tone The text units of both dialogue partners are identified by two
different colours The new text units by Red appear in each case following the period
needed in which to write them (The text units of Blue can be read as they are being
written)

Above the newly-appearing units the messages which immediately preceded them can be read on the screen As new text appears

Scene 28
Street with social housing InteriorDay

Pierre drives up by car gets out crosses the green area in front of the house reads the
name signs at the entrance and rings the bell He has to wait a while Finally the door
opens and a tall middle-aged man appears (We do not understand what both are saying
since the camera has remained on the street beside the car and has merely followed Pierre
in a panning shot) The discussion quickly leads to raised voices Suddenly the man strikes
Pierre in the face with his fist Completely taken by surprise Pierre falls backwards to the
ground and the man continues striking out at him furiously Pierre attempts to crawl away
and the man kicks into him once more before abandoning his assault withdrawing and
shouting

MAN Dont show your face around here again you damn bastard

It has all happened very quickly Pierre tries to stand up and staggers He then goes
forward towards the car cautiously feeling his face as he goes attempting to touch his
wound He wipes away the blood which is flowing from his nose

From the entrance door behind him a passer-by now emerges and comes over to the
street As she does so she notices Pierres condition and looks at him questioningly but
Pierre shakes his head with a contorted smile (Its nothing)

WOMAN (hesitantly) Are you hurt Can help you
PIERRE No no its nothing Everythings fine Thanks

Scene 29
Beach by the sea with snack bar ExteriorDay

Brilliant sunshine Wind
People bathing and surfing Thomas and Eve are in the process of walking to the
refreshment bar In the background on blankets spread-out in the sand are Anais and
the baby

EVE he just put on her parka and walked off wearing it

THOMAS Didnt she try to stop him

EVE She told Monsieur Hougron and he called in the guys parents

THOMAS Look at that

He points to a surfer who is performing an audacious manoeuvre Eve looks in the direction
in which he is pointing somewhat consternated by his lack of interest

EVE What is it
Thomas notices his mistake

THOMAS Nothing Thats amazing isnt it
And what then

EVE Well think they were mortified Of course he brought the parka back But
reckon its pretty dreadful

THOMAS Yes You sure have some harsh customs there
EVE guess so

They walk a few steps further and reach the snack bar where a few people are waiting
around

By the way theyre having a competition against (name of another school) In maths
English physics chemistry and sport Ive no

THOMAS (interrupting her again) What would you like then
EVE dont know Ice-cream

Thomas phone rings He looks at the display and is irritated
THOMAS (to Eve) Hold on a minute (into the telephone) Hello

At the other end scarcely audible is a WOMANS VOICE Eve turns towards the snack
bar and studies the snacks on offer on the handwritten board A moment later

THOMAS (to Eve) Can you get ice-cream for Anais as well - lemon if they have it -
and a bottle of Evian

He hands her his wallet and explains

The hospital (with a charming grin) Nothing works without me Ill be right back

He steps to one side Eve waits her turn then takes ice-cream and water and turns back
round Thomas has disappeared She is puzzled then looks behind the snack bar
The strangely intimate tone which she hears Thomas using on the telephone makes her
stop short She feels embarrassed and turns away Then she waits She peels the paper
off the ice-cream and licks it lost in thought She watches the surfers Finally Thomas
emerges from behind the snack bar and sees Eve standing there looking lost
THOMAS Hello sweetheart Sorry
EVE No worries
They head off towards the family
THOMAS Did you get everything
Eve hands him back his wallet
EVE Yeah They didnt have any Evian so got Badoit
THOMAS Fantastic
They walk towards the family Suddenly Eve asks
EVE Do you like Anais
Thomas stops and turns towards Eve
THOMAS What kind of question is that Of course Shes my wife
Brief PAUSE
EVE Mum was your wife too
For a moment Thomas does not know what to say then he laughs
THOMAS Thats true My God youre wise for your age
He walks on and she follows then he stops again
Hey princess of course love her Whats up then
EVE Absolutely nothing Im just asking
THOMAS Why
EVE No reason
He shakes his head smiling (What problems kids have) They walk on The camera stops

and they get further away
After a few steps
THOMAS Do you know how met Anais

EVE (disinterested as she is thinking about something else) No
THOMAS (with amused laughter) She laid me out flat (grinning) With her car
EVE Really

THOMAS Not exactly But almost crossed the street without looking and didnt see
her She was driving fast braked her car skidded and the side of it hit me fell over
actually more out of shock She was completely frazzled You need to see a doctor
right away So said was the doctor She didn’t find that funny at all She

The two are now so far from the camera that we can no longer make out what they are
saying Finally they reach Anais and the baby Anais enthusiastically takes up the thread of
Thomas narrative while Eve hands her the bottle of water and ice-cream Thomas in good
spirits drops down beside her and the baby onto the spread-out towel beneath the parasol
They gabble on cheerfully to Eve who is standing still licking her ice-cream Beyond the
surfers are splashing about A few black-African refugees stroll along the waters edge
generally unheeded by the others on the beach

Scene 30
Pierres apartment InteriorNight

A bachelor apartment Plush but neglected

Pierre lies half-dressed on the unmade crumpled bed He is sleeping The blood on his face
has been partly wiped away but some of it remains dried on He has taken off his shirt One
of his shoulders is covered with a large tattoo The DOORBELL RINGS Pierre wakes up but
remains lying there

The DOORBELL RINGS MORE INSISTENTLY AND AFTER A PAUSE RINGS AGAIN
Pierre does not move SILENCE

Then Pierres MOBILE PHONE RINGS After a while Pierre fishes for his jacket takes out
his mobile phone and looks to see who is calling He puts it away again After a brief
SILENCE the MOBILE PHONE RINGS again Pierre lets it RING Finally he picks up

PIERRE (in a hostile tone but exhausted and softly-spoken) Yes

We hear an agitated WOMANS VOICE although we cannot discern what is being said
Pierre says nothing at all for a while Then with lengthy pauses in between

The WOMANS VOICE continues talking insistently at him Finally Pierre stands up wearily
goes to the apartment door opens it and comes back letting himself fall back onto the bed
in a resigned attitude Behind him Anne enters the room She remains standing in the
doorway contemplating the disorder Since Pierre shows no sign of reacting to her she sits
down exhausted on a chair Long SILENCE

ANNEwell then dont know what to say

PAUSE
PIERRE Just dont say anything
PAUSE

ANNE (having another go making an effort to remain calm) You cant just
disappear like that

PIERRE (calmly) Cant

A lengthy PAUSE Finally she gets up and sits down beside Pierre on the bed He turns his
head away

ANNE Let me take a look at you

She gently tries to turn his head towards her Finally he gives way and looks at her She
shakes her head with a slight smile

ANNE It could only happen to you
PIERRE How kind of you to say that
He turns his head away in irritation

ANNE Hey look think its great you went there After all no one could have known
that crazy guy would be lying in wait

PIERRE Mum please

ANNE But then why did you run away Instead of going straight to the police
That could have been in our favour if we want to get them to agree ona
settlement

He has not thought of that He shrugs his shoulders acknowledging his mistake Anne gives
him a long gaze

ANNE But why did you run away from work Are you ashamed because youve got a
black eye You cant just drop everything like that

PIERRE Well as you see can

ANNE (somewhat losing her pleasant tone) And how do you think thats going to
work if may ask

You have a lot in your favour Pierrot Youre my son and youre the future boss But
as you know its not all set in stone So kindly make a bit of an effort Your excesses
and this whole accident saga are hardly helping me in my attempts to rescue the firm
you do understand that dont you

PIERRE Can you stop please mum Please

A long helpless PAUSE Then Anne gently places her hand on Pierres arm and says

ANNE (tenderly) Whats the matter with you

Pierre merely shakes his head in a gesture of resignation (Theres no point in talking to
you)

ANNE Since when have you been drinking didnt notice at all
PIERRE dont drink
PAUSE She is already familiar with this line of discussion
ANNE (softly) What am to do Can help you
Pierre laughs a bitter dry LAUGH
Are you overworked Are you scared Do you need medical help
Renewed scornful puffing from Pierre

just dont know Since you moved out have no idea what youre up to Have you
got a girlfriend Are you unhappy in your love life Talk to me

SILENCE

What do you do in the evening after work
SILENCE

Arent you talking to me any more
PAUSE Then

PIERRE go and lie down

ANNE You go and lie down

PIERRE What am supposed to do (In your opinion)
What do YOU do

Pierre turns away his gaze with a scornful smirk PAUSE It is only now that Anne notices
for the first time the tattoo on Pierres shoulder

And where did you get THAT
PIERRE What
ANNE (points to the tattoo) That
He looks at her Then he stands up and leaves the room We hear him os OPENING THE

BATHROOM DOOR and PEEING Then the TOILET FLUSHES When he comes back and
makes to go to the window Anne blocks his way She embraces him he breaks away she
embraces him again and presses him to herself stroking his head

Pierrot my dear sweetheart You need to accept help

PIERRE (helplessly attempting to resist) Mum
She presses herself against him and holds him tight For a while he gives way Then he
withdraws again and drops down onto the chair beside him He attempts to resist the
intimacy and looks out of the window She stands behind him and strokes his head with
sadness and resignation He tolerates this for a while then turns his head away She lets
her hand fall After a while she sits down on the chair beside him Both look straight ahead
After a while

PIERRE (softly) Im no good

ANNE What

PIERRE Im no good
Shocked PAUSE

ANNE What kind of nonsense is that

Pierre turns towards her

PIERRE But thats exactly what you think yourself Whats all the fuss about You
know very well Ill never take over this bloody business

PAUSE
ANNE So what are you going to do instead
PIERRE Nothing Why should do anything
Anne stands up and goes to the window
ANNE (irritated) Stop feeling sorry for yourself And stop behaving like a sulky
schoolboy just because someone punched you on the nose Whats the point of

that

PIERRE Aha now thats more like the mum know Dont you want to go home and
carry on with your work

She looks at him Then
ANNE Youre beyond help

PIERRE (smirking) You said it mum

carry Georges out of the ambulance and into the wheelchair When he is sitting Anne bends

we cannot understand what she is saying because the dog is BARKING At the same time
Rachid has attached the dog to a chain He comes over to the ambulance and takes
Georges luggage The paramedics wheel Georges into the house and disappear behind the

Wide shot of the relatively large room Six women lie in six beds more or less motionless
Some of them occasionally utter noises Thomas and Eve enter and have to look around
before they are able to locate Eves mother She is lying right on the left next to the door

Wide shot Georges rolls up along the road A number of people look somewhat astonished
at the old man in a wheelchair Georges passes a small group of black-African refugees
who also look at him He stops and calls them over to him They approach him hesitantly He
tries to speak with them but appears not to succeed since the strangers are somewhat
irritated and speak with one another rather than with him Several passers-by observe the
group partly disconcerted partly amused Georges takes his watch off his wrist and holds it
out to the man nearest to him who is baffled and takes a step back The other men also find
his action strange They discuss together An elderly gentleman has seen events as he
passes by and now approaches Georges and the men He speaks to Georges The black
men retreat and stroll off some of them looking around at Georges in irritation and
puzzlement Georges too watches them go he is annoyed at having been interrupted there
is a heated discussion between him and the elderly man

prospective purchasers and children The reason for the sale is alluded to death of the
owner)

Eve sits in one of the rooms waiting When the purchasers enter she stands up and is
introduced by Thomas as his daughter The tour of the rest of the house is then continued
without her

Scene 36
Villa Georges’ bedroom InteriorDay

Barbers tools are spread out on the table
GEORGES’ VOICE You can go now Rachid dont need you any more
RACHID As you wish Monsieur If you need me just ring
GEORGES’ VOICE Sure

Rachid leaves the room Georges whose face still bears slight traces of the traffic accident
turns towards the barber who is standing beside him

GEORGES (smiling) Now Ive offended him
The barber smiles understandingly

GEORGES He shaves me every day He doesnt like it when someone else lays a
hand on me

The barber begins cutting Georges hair He is in good spirits and has a very gay manner
BARBER (with ironic flirtatiousness) But Im hardly touching you Monsieur
Georges grins
GEORGES How are you
BARBER Ah well my profession keeps me busy

Georges glances up at him and gives an ironic smile

GEORGES Your profession And what does that consist of
BARBER But you know that Monsieur cut your hair
He cuts Then

cut the hair of many gentlemen cut the hair of Monsieur Delamare cut the hair of
Monsieur Franck cut the hair

GEORGES Youre getting on my nerves Thomas
BARBER Yes Monsieur
He slaps his hand against his mouth
Forgive me
He carries on cutting After a while
GEORGES How much do you earn each month
The barber is gobsmacked Then
BARBER (grinning) Thats not the kind of question one asks Monsieur
GEORGES (seriously) Dont you need any money
BARBER Everyone needs money
GEORGES Precisely
PAUSE
So
BARBER dont understand what you mean Monsieur
Georges shakes his head in resignation at so much stupidity
GEORGES How long have you been coming here now
The barber ponders continuing to cut Georges hair
BARBER Over ten years Monsieur

GEORGES Almost twenty You should learn how to count My arteries may be furred
up but know exactly how many

BARBER (pretending in a coquettish manner to be shocked) But Im not that old

PAUSE
GEORGES (in a tone of seriousness putting an end to the banter) You could do me
a favour

The barber stops cutting
BARBER Really
GEORGES Ill pay you a decent amount
BARBER Well

Georges ponders The barber resumes cutting
GEORGES (irritated) Stop all that fiddling

The barber lowers his hands He appears somewhat aggrieved by Georges manner of
speaking

GEORGES Im sorry
The barber shakes his head (no worries) PAUSE
GEORGES Im stuck here
The barber gives a questioning look
GEORGES drove into a tree but wasnt clever enough to do it properly
BARBER but Monsieur They told me it was an accident

GEORGES (with a slight sarcastic smile) Yes That kind of thing doesnt look too
good

Perplexed PAUSE on the part of the barber

GEORGES My son is a fool asked him Hes a doctor - it would have been a piece
of cake for him But hes pig-headed

The barber looks at Georges in disbelief
GEORGES Last year was in Zurich They refused me Apparently Im too healthy
He smirks bitterly

Anyway Im a prisoner in this bloody chair You understand (Sarcastic laugh) Now
cant even run away

PAUSE The barber stares at Georges
If you get me a pistol and some bullets it wont hurt you

BARBER But Monsieur

GEORGES A shotgun or a big enough quantity of tablets would work too
Ive got money here can make you rich At least rich enough so you dont have to
carry on cutting the hair of elderly fools
PAUSE Then
So

BARBER Monsieur dont know what to say How am supposed to get you that
kind of thing dont know anyone

GEORGES (irritated) My God

BARBER (interrupting) And theyd suspect me right away if you Anyway why
do you want to do it Youve completely taken me by surprise

GEORGES What would you do in my position
BARBER dont know But you feel well dont you
Georges utters a dry LAUGH
GEORGES Are you as naive as all that Or are you just afraid
The barber is initially not sure what to say Then
BARBER Of course Im afraid How could do something like that cant do it
PAUSE Then
No really
PAUSE
GEORGES Dont scare yourself shitless Forget it was a fool to ask you
BARBER (uncomfortably) No 1
GEORGES (referring to his hair) Feel free to carry on
The barber hesitates a moment longer undecided then resumes cutting Both are silent

Scene 37
Villa Large salon with adjacent dining room InteriorNight

The room is full of guests Individual heads the whole family is present (including Pierre
slight traces of the fight still visible in his face) Georges impeccably groomed with his
freshly cut short hair elegantly dressed and bearing almost no external signs of his
accident is sitting in his wheelchair at the centre of the audience as they listen to a young
musician It is the woman from Scene 26 She looks pretty and fragile and it is not clear
whether we have seen her before She plays the end of an old French VIOL SONATA
APPLAUSE She bows Georges wheels himself over to her and thanks her warmly
shaking her hand and gallantly kissing the hand which has played so beautifully The

guests begin getting up from their chairs but Anne has walked over beside Georges and in
doing so interrupts the guests as they are about to make for the buffet

ANNE Dear friends Id like to thank you warmly on behalf of our family for all coming
here at such short notice and (she gestures) in such numbers to celebrate dads 85
birthday As some of you have no doubt heard the last few weeks have been pretty
turbulent but we are all glad our birthday boy has recovered so well and so quickly
and we are full of hope that he will soon be back to full health (to Georges jokingly)
After all what is it you always say — Only the good die young

Chuckling and isolated LAUGHTER Georges grins

And on top of that we have some good and positive news

What most of you dont know is that following the wonderful addition to the family last
year when little Alain came into the world we have yet another new and quite
unexpected addition Thomas daughter from his first marriage (she gestures) Eve
has come to join us and share our lives

Thomas pushes Eve who is standing beside him and the baby a little towards the front so
that everyone can see her

Eve were very happy to have you with us

Anne initiates APPLAUSE and the guests follow suit Eve finds it all rather embarrassing
She is not quite sure how to conduct herself with little success she attempts awkwardly to
hide herself

So And now dont want to take up any more of your time
She turns to the musician

Mademoiselle Id like to thank you with all my heart for your beautiful playing know
you have given dad great joy

The young woman bows smiling Anne turns back towards the guests The young
musicians gaze has wandered over to Thomas who has just turned to Eve but in the
process looks in her direction Their eyes meet and their gaze lingers briefly before — as if
caught in the act — they look elsewhere At the same time Anne says

After such spiritual pleasures dont want to keep you any longer from worldly
indulgence the champagne and buffet are waiting wish you all a wonderful evening

APPLAUSE Chatting the guests either go over to the buffet table behind which Jamila is
standing with another Arab woman who is serving or they remain standing or sit down in
the various seating areas Small groups couples A few young women come over to Anais
to talk about the baby she is carrying on her arm Several older people come forward to join
Georges who is talking to the musician as she bends over him

Anne goes over to her English friend Lawrence Bratshow (whom we know from Scene 11)
links arms with him and pulls him slightly away from the crowd towards the niche of the
garden door

ANNE (in English) Im so glad you came As soon as dads freed himself from his
young admirer Ill take you over to see him He enjoys your company you know
although he can hardly hear what you say any more He was always a great admirer
of the female sex

LAWRENCE (in English looking at Georges with a smile on his face) But hes
obviously well Its amazing - after all it wasnt that long ago

ANNE (in English) Yeah Hes awesome (She presses his arm to her)

(She looks over at Georges and the musician whom Thomas is just approaching
interrupting their conversation) Hell be pleased to see you again (smiling
conspiratorially) but dont say anything about us

Pierre watches his mother and her lover standing a few steps away from Eve then turns
away in irritation and goes over to Eve who is standing there beside Anais looking a bit lost

PIERRE Shall we go and plunder the buffet cuz
Eve looks up at him snatched away from her thoughts Brief PAUSE
EVE If you like

PIERRE (smiles) After all cant let you waste away Do me a favour and follow my
example
Arent you hungry

At the same time we hear Anais discussion with her friends of the same age She has little
Alain on her arm

ANAIS and then he kept us awake the whole night Which means end up going
into the other room with him - after all Thomas has to leave early

FIRST WOMAN You need to give him ox blood tablets Just crush them and rub
them into his gums its

ANAIS (interrupting her) know know Were already trying everything
massage ox blood chamomile extract but once he gets going almost nothing
virtually nothing works the day before yesterday

Pierre places his hand lightly on Eves shoulder - she has a rather pained smile - and leads
her towards the buffet through the people standing around without Anais really noticing their
departure as she continues chatting He appears slightly drunk

FIRST MANS VOICE they just keep going down Over there you wont get more
than three to three and a half per square metre Max

FIRST MANS VOICE Well It does depend on the condition And the location too of
course Over in XXX (name of a residential area) it can be up to five euros

FIRST MANS VOICE Yeah luxury class but dont you find

FIRST WOMANS VOICE couldnt care less about the south any more cant
stand the heat You lie around sweating and you cant even think straight

SECOND WOMANS VOICE Valerie you know Valerie dont you the one with the
loud voice

FIRST WOMANS VOICE the one who cant hear very well

SECOND WOMANS VOICE Exactly She was in Spain last summer True it was the
north coast near Orviedo It

Eve and Pierre arrive at the buffet He puts a plate in her hand
PIERRE What would you like then
EVE Ill take a look for myself
PIERRE (grinning) How old are you

Eve feels uncomfortable about the question in front of all the people And in any case he
should already know

EVE Fourteen

PIERRE Exactly Yeah Sorry
Ive going to have some of Jamilas rice dish Thats her speciality most highly
recommended

Eve nods and takes a little of the hors doeuvres while Pierre walks away in the direction of
the rice dish
In parallel to all this we hear snatches of conversation between those standing around

SECOND WOMANS VOICE but of course its a man Thered have to be a miracle
and we all know miracles dont happen very often

THIRD MANS VOICE ask you Surely you dont mean to seriously claim

THIRD WOMANS VOICE Im not claiming anything Im stating a fact Surely you
dont want to deny that women occupy a marginal share of managerial positions

THIRD MANS VOICE Arent you having any salmon

That wont change as a result of compulsory quotas On the contrary it seems to me
much more a case of discrimination Would you like to be in your job thanks to a
quota system You are where you are because youre competent not because youre
a woman

THIRD WOMANS VOICE Are you really so naive or are you just acting that way

Suddenly we hear rather too loud to remain unnoticed from near the rice dish the
amused

VOICE OF PIERRE You must try Jamilas rice dish my dear Its out of this world
You should all try it my dears Jamila (he embraces the young lady who smiling in
embarrassment attempts to pull away) Jamila is our Tunisian slave She is our gift
from God she cooks like Jean-Paul Lacombe and we all know only too well how
much we owe her

(He applauds) Bravo Jamila

JAMILA (giggles embarrassed and flattered) But Monsieur
Some of the people have looked up in irritation Those standing nearest laugh in a
somewhat pained fashion With a gesture of apology Anne has left Lawrence standing on
his own and goes over to Pierre Before she has reached him Thomas appears beside Eve

THOMAS (ignoring Pierres provocation) Want to come with me sweetheart
She turns from Pierre to Thomas puzzled

Itd be nice if youd congratulate grandpa
Eve looks at her half-filled plate (And what am supposed to do with that)
For a moment Thomas does not know what to do but then he takes the plate out of Eves
hand

hold on Ill put it down here for a moment
and leans across the buffet placing it on the other side of the table At the same time a new
COUPLE pushes past the buffet (they are talking about a film that is just starting - topical
text to be added) Eve looks at Pierre again with whom Anne is now speaking in a quiet but
agitated tone The people around gloss over the embarrassing situation with varying
degrees of skill

THOMAS Come on

In a similar manner to Pierre previously he takes her by the shoulder and pushes her
through the people in the direction of Georges
Snatches of conversation as they pass by

THIRD WOMANS VOICE think the opening is planned for 2018 Summer or
autumn dont know just read it somewhere in the paper Youll have to ask them

THIRD WOMANS VOICE what kind of campaign was that Do you know him

FOURTH MANS VOICE was wondering if should get an animal like that too
There are more and more

FOURTH MANS VOICE To be honest to me its over the top Theres never been a
break-in

FOURTH MANS VOICE but would you like those black folks hanging around
outside your door
Opposite the Verbecqs theyve got canvas shelters at the entrance to the grounds

SIXTH MANS VOICE and anyway you never know whether there are any Islamic
State people among them theyre basically

SIXTH WOMANS VOICE sold the beach house and gave the money to the kids
She said she cant go in the water any more cos of her rheumatism and she doesnt
want to sit outside and watch the others

Thomas has worked his way with Eve through the people to reach Georges He is still
engaged in conversation with the young female musician

THOMAS Hello dad may interrupt you for a moment Eve would like to say
something to you

The musician and Georges turn towards Thomas and Eve Eve stands there not knowing
what to do or say

GEORGES Yes
EVE Happy birthday
GEORGES Thank you

An embarrassed PAUSE The musician and Thomas briefly look into each others eyes then
to Eve who has noticed the exchange of glances

GEORGES Well Arent getting a birthday kiss

After a brief hesitation Eve bends down over the wheelchair towards Georges and shyly
kisses him

GEORGES (smiling) Who are you then sweetie

Scene 38
Law office InteriorDay

Anne Pierre and their lawyer (Maitre Barin) with his assistant the ruffian from Scene 33 and
an older woman evidently the wife of the man who had the accident

LAWYER Let me welcome you here today and thank you all for coming

First of all may just once again express my clients regret over the unfortunate
accident As you know the official investigations that began immediately after the
accident did not yield any indications as to any culpable conduct or fault on the part of
the firm of Laurent So we may assume that the public prosecutors office will shortly
abandon the criminal proceedings which were automatically commenced would also
add that in my view neither is it possible for my clients to be accused of any civil
wrong

However naturally Mr and Mrs Laurent are aware of the difficult financial situation
arising for your family as a result - quite apart from the tragic nature of the incident
This is particularly in view of the fact that your young children will be dependent on
you for some years to come In theory you could now try to claim any civil damages
through the courts However as said do not consider that this would have any
legal basis

Nevertheless our clients are willing to support you in this difficult situation and pay
you a substantial sum totalling EUR 15000 in order at least to lessen your financial
distress Though would stress that they are under no obligation to make such a
payment

Naturally you dont have to make a firm decision now on whether or not you wish to
accept this offer and so avoid court proceedings You can simply discuss the matter
with a lawyer of your choice and then get back in touch with me

He looks at Pierre whose face still bears slight traces of the attack and then back to
the other side

Incidentally the prosecution authorities do not yet know anything of the incident
outside your house in respect of which we have since identified a witness also
resident at the same address Ms Monique Delorme

And - if you wish - the public prosecutor need not hear of the matter Just as there
need not be any claim proceedings Do you understand what am saying

Eve looking pale and fragile in bed She is on a drip Thomas is on the visitors chair Long

SILENCE Then

THOMAS What that youre unhappy that you miss your mother that youre
alone what do know we cant just see inside you

EVE So
THOMAS So what
PAUSE Then

EVE (softly) Youre so far away

Thomas is perturbed and does not know whether she means this in the physical or
metaphorical sense He spontaneously slides his chair a little closer but ends up having to
smile himself at his stupidity He leans over and takes her hand

THOMAS I love you
Eve nods but does not look at him

THOMAS (leaning over closer) Please believe me Im inept but love you

EVE (looks at him) Will you take me with you when you leave Anais

THOMAS (completely taken aback) What

EVE Will you take me with you

THOMAS Why should leave Anais What kind of nonsense is that

EVE Ive got another four years till Im 18 Im not going into care

THOMAS What kind of stuff is this youre cobbling together Why should you go
into care

EVE (looks away softly) OK

THOMAS What does OK mean Are you out of your mind Whats the meaning
of all this love you No-one wants to put you in care How can you even think of
such an idea

EVE (lifts her gaze looks at him) Will you take me with you when you leave Anais

Pause Thomas tries to control himself

THOMAS OK Im telling you Im not taking you anywhere with me because Im
not leaving Anais OK Can we get back to talking sensibly

Brief PAUSE

EVE On the beach heard what you said on the phone And read your e-mails
Thomas is aghast

THOMAS What did you say

EVE (looks at him) Dad Please Stop putting on an act

No problem about that just dont want to go into care
Long SILENCE Then
THOMAS (softly) Why did you take mums tablets
EVE There were still enough left over

THOMAS And you put them in your pocket and took them with you Just in
case

EVE Yeah

A helpless PAUSE Then awkwardly Thomas tries again to take Eves hand She pulls it
away

EVE Ow That hurts

A brief exchange of glances between Anne and Maitre Barin Anne nods The director
indicates to Lawrence to pass Anne the page for signature

who have succeeded in playing a prank Maitre Barin notices nothing

Scene 41
Computer screen InteriorNight

As in Scene 20

(Below is the text of the e-mail to which a response is now being written and which is thereby disappearing line by line from the screen

speechless as the day before yesterday itll take hours and hours one inside the body and inside the breath of the other so as
to repair the damage caused by this separation )

The first lines of the new e-mail are already written

My poor darling you cant imagine what this separation means for me too Im
counting

From here from the beginning of the scene the text appears as it is being written We hear
the SOUND OF TYPING

the days till we see each other again Ten times a day look at your photo on my
mobile your wonderful body that makes me crazy with desire

Something stupid has happened My daughter looked around on my computer and
discovered our e-mails She tried to take her own life Thank God without success

Scene 42
Villa Georges bedroom InteriorDay

Eve enters hesitantly
EVE Dad says you want to speak to me

Georges is sitting in his wheelchair in front of the emptied plates from lunch and looks at her
silently for a moment

GEORGES No dont actually
PAUSE Eve does not know how to react
GEORGES Would you like some cheese
Brief PAUSE
EVE No Thank you
GEORGES Its not bad
Brief PAUSE
EVE don’t like cheese
GEORGES Well then
PAUSE
GEORGES You need to decide In or out
Eve looks at him questioningly
GEORGES Or do you want to keep standing in the doorway
Eve looks at him and shrugs her shoulders (I dont know it depends on you)
GEORGES Now close the door princess and sit down by me
Eve hesitantly closes the door she remains standing
GEORGES Are you scared
EVE No
GEORGES Then come here
She remains standing where she is

Now come on
She does not move PAUSE
Right
He moves the wheelchair a little so that he is sitting directly facing her

Your father was fibbing dont want to talk to you He asked me to do it He thinks
you dont trust him and hes worried

A hint of a contemptuous smile appears on Eves lips
Why did you try to kill yourself
In irritation Eve looks away She regrets not having left immediately

Ill tell you something You can stay on your feet or you can sit down Its entirely up
to you

She does not move PAUSE
You didnt know your grandmother You were here once when you were small You
wont remember it
Or do you

Eve grudgingly shakes her head He looks at her

Wait

He wheels himself over to a shelf behind him and takes down a photo album then
wheels himself back to the table and puts the album on it

Come here

Grudgingly and hesitantly Eve approaches He opens the album and turns it towards her
Look at this

Still standing she looks at the album He turns the page
She was a beautiful lady dont you think

Eve says nothing
When you were here she was already ill You didnt see her at all She was lying
crippled in her bed and couldnt speak any more took care of her gave the
business to your aunt so Id have the time for her In the end after three years of
horrible and pointless suffering suffocated her

Eve looks at him half shocked half incredulous

It was the right thing to do Ive never regretted it for one moment
He snaps the photo album shut

Thats the whole story wanted to tell you
Will you tell me your story

EVE What story
GEORGES Why did you take the tablets
Eve says nothing
Do you think Im too dumb to understand
PAUSE
Huh
Eve shakes her head obstinately Long PAUSE
Sit down wont you
Hesitantly Eve sits down Long SILENCE Then
EVE (softly) tried to poison one of my schoolmates once
PAUSE
GEORGES Did you
EVE Well not exactly poison her Mum put me in a holiday camp when dad
disappeared They gave me bromazepam to keep me quiet was supposed to take
two tablets a day didnt want any tablets There was a girl there didnt like Every
day mixed my tablets into her food It was funny to see how she got quieter and
quieter In the end she collapsed They examined her and thats how they found out
GEORGES And What happened
EVE Nothing had to leave the camp
GEORGES And go home
EVE Yeah
PAUSE
GEORGES And Were you sorry
EVE Not very

PAUSE
AT

Well yes was
Yes was sorry Later The girl wasnt nice but it wasnt her fault

He gives her a lingering look Then
GEORGES Not long ago was looking into the garden here and by chance saw
how a bird of prey ripped a little bird to pieces It caught it in flight shook it to and fro
then tore it to shreds on the ground with its beak It really tore it to shreds The
feathers were flying about and landed all scattered over the ground It looked as if
snow had fallen Then a car drove past and the bird of prey flew off Apart from the
feathers there was hardly anything left of the victim At least thats how it looked from
here
Its funny If you see something like that on TV you feel its normal - thats what
nature is like But in reality it makes your hands tremble when you see it

He smiles a little His eyes linger on her First of all she avoids his gaze then looks up at
him

Why did you do it
EVE What
GEORGES The tablets
EVE dont know
Brief PAUSE She lowers her eyes
(very softly) dont know
Renewed PAUSE She raises her eyes to Georges again They look at one another He

smiles a little

Scene 43
Servants quarters at the villa InteriorNight

Thomas is in the process of gingerly examining Selin the four-year-old daughter of Rachid
She has small slightly-inflamed bite wounds on her calves is tearful and a little afraid that
Thomas may hurt her while examining her Tense SILENCE Thomas presses in various
places on her leg

THOMAS Does that hurt
The girl nods

RACHID He only nipped her

JAMILA (in Arabic) How can you say something like that
(in French to Thomas agitated) He bit her She ran away and cried
RACHID (correcting Jamila half to her and half to Thomas) They were playing She
ran round the pool and called him and he followed her and nipped her Its not as bad
as all that
(in Arabic) You should have watched out better

Jamila is about to contradict him but leaves it and turns to Thomas
JAMILA Is it bad
THOMAS (reassuring her) No
(to the child) Youre a brave girl Dont worry Ill give your mummy a prescription and
tomorrow shell put some cream on it for you its a fantastic cream and in a few days
you wont feel anything any more OK

The girl nods She is not quite convinced Thomas covers her up gets up and turns to
Rachid

Still you need to keep a closer eye on the dog (with a little ironic smile) After all we
dont have him so he can bite us do we

Rachid is embarrassed to be told off like this in front of his wife and is about to say
something but just at the same moment Anne enters through the door

ANNE Well how is she
THOMAS (reassuringly) Its not serious It was more the shock

Anne goes over to the girl and crouches down beside her She has a box of chocolates in
her hand

ANNE Here sweetheart
SELIN (shyly and slightly overwhelmed) Thank you
ANNE Lets take a look
She uncovers Selins legs and looks at them
Well that doesnt look so bad after all does it

On seeing the wounds she gives Thomas an anxious glance and he gives her a placatory
nod She then turns quickly back to Selin

Every time it hurts a bit you can have a chocolate then all the pain will go away
OK

Selin nods again timidly Anne strokes her cheek affectionately

Now you have a good sleep It’s late already And tomorrows another lovely day
She gets up and turns to Rachid and Jamila

Thank God nothing terrible happened was beside myself when Anais called me

JAMILA Yes it was terrible she cried dreadfully

ANNE You need to keep the animal better under control Rachid Otherwise well get

THOMAS (interrupting her) Ive already told him
He turns to Jamila

Ill write you a prescription for the cream You need to apply it gently first thing
tomorrow so it doesnt get more inflamed

While he is writing down the name of the cream for Jamila Rachid timidly turns to Anne
RACHID Congratulations Madame if may say so

Anne looks at him uncomprehendingly
ANNE Why

Brief PAUSE

RACHID (with an embarrassed but knowing smile) Madame Anais told me

ANNE (as above) What

Rachid feels awkward He makes a little gesture as if to say you know Suddenly
Anne realizes

Oh You mean the engagement Yes thank you Thats kind of you

In fact she is vexed at having to talk about it with Rachid She turns to Thomas
Was it you

Thomas is just handing Jamila the prescription

THOMAS Yes (to Jamila) Twice morning and evening Ill drop by again tomorrow
(to both) Right Then

ANNE Have a nice evening

RACHID and JAMILA Good night Madame good night Monsieur

Just as Anne is in the process of leaving the room
RACHID Madame
Anne and Thomas turn around
ANNE Yes
Brief PAUSE Then
RACHID Will you be moving away from here now
Anne is nonplussed
ANNE Whatever makes you think THAT

Scene 44
Villa Thomas work room

Initially close-up the screen of Thomas laptop

InteriorDay

Eve is attempting to search through the computer but is unable to continue because a new

code has been set
From outside FOOTSTEPS and then the

VOICE OF ANAIS EveEve

Eve quickly folds the laptop shut and scurries to the door She listens When she hears
nothing she opens the door Anais is just coming back from Eves room and sees her

coming out of Thomas room

ANAIS There you are need to get something from town and wanted to ask you to

So what were you doing in Thomas room

EVE Nothing just

My computer crashed Nothing works any more And wanted to look on dads laptop

ANAIS (slightly puzzled) Really
Well you can ask him when he gets back

EVE OK

ANAIS Are you going to stay here for now wont be long Hes

EVE Sure Ill go and sit with him in his room No worries
ANAIS Thanks

She goes in the direction of the kitchen in order to fetch her shopping bag Calls out
Shall get you anything Im going to the supermarket as well

Eve has stood still relieved at having got away with her pretence
EVE No Thanks dont need anything

Scene 45
Beach restaurant ExteriorDay

Outside the restaurant a large terrace overlooking the sea with festively-decorated round
tables around which an equally festively-dressed assembly of guests have taken their seats
they are the friends and business partners of our family We know many of them from
Georges birthday celebration (Scene 37)

Beside the terrace is a tarmac road which leads uphill to a residential street and downhill to
the sea

The restaurant staff supported by party caterers are in the process of collecting up the hors
doeuvres plates Over this we hear generally the lively CHATTERING of the guests

Anne and Lawrence sit next to each other and at the same table are Georges (in his
wheelchair) Thomas Anais and Eve A sixth chair remains empty

Here too the hors doeuvres plates are just being cleared away

THOMAS (in English to Lawrence) Id love it if you dropped by Four months ago
we reorganized the ward and got a few new people in too Theyre efficient
committed and most of all theyre really nice And thats pretty important too
LAWRENCE (in English) Sure Lets fix a time It really does interest me (smirking)
And you never know Maybe Ill be a patient there myself one day It cant hurt to
know the people

THOMAS (in English grinning because he means himself) Well you know the boss
already So nothing can go wrong

LAWRENCE (laughing in English) Precisely
At the same time the head waiter has approached Anne and asks

HEAD WAITER Excuse me Madame should we serve the main course right away
or would you prefer to take a break

ANNE Good question

She reflects Then she turns to Lawrence and briefly interrupts his conversation with
Thomas

(in English) What do you think darling Should we go right ahead with the main
course Or should be wait a bit

LAWRENCE (somewhat surprised) Oh No idea Whatever you think

Anne hesitates for a moment glances at Georges who is just putting a glass of wine to his
lips and then turns to the head waiter

ANNE No think well go straight ahead Anyway people dont want to sit out here
for ages in this weather

HEAD WAITER Sure Madame Just as you wish
He walks off into the restaurant Anne turns to Georges

ANNE Are you all right dad Do you feel OK
Georges empties his glass and places it back on the table

GEORGES (dryly) Excellent feel excellent

Eve looks at Georges then lowers her gaze she is bored among all the adults A young
woman has approached from one of the adjacent tables and crouches down beside Anais

YOUNG WOMAN (to Anais) Sorry to trouble you about it right now but we have to
head off straight after the meal so might not be able to have a word before we go

ANAIS Yes whats the matter
YOUNG WOMAN Could you lend me your babysitter tomorrow Mine has gone
home and wont be back for another two weeks and our stand-by has a bad cold You

know how it is

ANAIS (reflects for a moment then) Sure It should be OK Tomorrow hold on
yes its fine But only tomorrow cos the day after

During her last few words from some distance away we hear loud and infelicitous the
VOICE OF PIERRE Sorry mum Im truly sorry Im so late
Anais turns towards the voice as do the young woman and countless other guests
But first had to get changed for the festive occasion
He is standing on the far side of the tables and points to his smoking jacket A few steps
away from him stands a small group of black-African refugees in tattered clothing They

clearly feel uncomfortable in this situation but appear to not fully understand what is actually
going on
hope Im presentable enough
No doubt your official speeches were impressive and sorely regret having missed
them

Anne has stood up
ANNE (alarmed) Pierre
Lawrence too has stood up He places a calming hand on Annes arm
LAWRENCE (in English) Stay calm darling Ill deal with it
He goes towards Pierre through the tables and the people who have in the meantime
almost all turned towards the new arrivals
The young woman gestures with her head towards Pierre
YOUNG WOMAN (to Anais) So whos that
PIERRE (still loud with mocking affability) But to make up for my mistakes and to
make you happy have brought along some extra guests whod be pleased to join

your festive table in your honour

Lawrence has now arrived at Pierres side and gently tries to take him to one side in order
to avoid further embarrassment

LAWRENCE (in English to Pierre) Come down here Pierre Stop all these theatrics
We just want to

PIERRE (in English smirking but speaking softly like Lawrence) Theres nothing to
be stopped dear chap And youre the last person to tell me what to do

Pierre is about to leave Lawrence standing there but Lawrence is discreetly holding onto
him so as to avoid the provocation escalating further Whereupon Pierre hisses softly

Shut up motherfucker

and tears himself away from Lawrence making him stumble and almost fall over Anne who
has just joined them spontaneously helps Lawrence up There is a general reaction among
the crowd Some of the guests stand up some disconcerted others annoyed

Georges has followed events as has Eve Clearly confused she turns towards him After a
brief pause

GEORGES Will you get me out of here chérie

She is puzzled by the term of affection but after a brief hesitation nods her consent She
steps up behind him and begins to push him over the terrace in the direction of the road
They are virtually unnoticed due to the goings-on around Pierre

Pierre pulls away from Thomas who has in the meantime gone over to him and attempts to
calm him down Pierre joins the group of refugees who in their bewilderment try to resist
him as he tries to drag them forwards in the direction of the guests

PIERRE May introduce my new friends This is Mohammed Hes from Nigeria His
wife and two children were burnt to death in a punishment killing by Boku Haram He
took a year to get here and now hes been trekking out of the jungle to the tunnel
every day for months in the hope of finally getting a ride

And this is Youssef from if can remember rightly from

Anne has had a brief word with Lawrence and now she goes up to Pierre
PIERRE (Ah so youre here too) Bonjour Maman

He makes to push her away so he can carry on but she steps into his path again and takes
his hands in hers in an attempt to pacify him however he once more pushes her aside with a
smile

(All the previous calming attempts by Lawrence Thomas and Anne have remained low-key
restrained and deliberately softly spoken with the absurd intention of covering up Pierres
disgraceful behaviour)

Having been pushed aside Anne is still loosely holding Pierres hand In panic and fury with

a small sharp movement she breaks his finger He CRIES out in pain looks at his hand
the protruding finger and then aghast at Anne She raises her hand in a half-soothing half-
apologetic gesture but immediately lets it fall There is a moment of shocked and perplexed
silence between the two Thomas steps up Pierre looks at him then back at Anne and
finally he utters a laugh soft scornful and despairing he turns away gingerly holding his
injured hand against his chest There is a brief look of understanding between Anne and
Thomas then Thomas takes Pierre by the shoulders and leads him inside the restaurant
gently reasoning with him

In the meantime Lawrence has discreetly instructed the staff to set up an additional table
With friendly gestures the refugees are invited to take a seat and to dine with them all

Anne watches Pierre as he disappears in the direction of the restaurant and then turns to
the baffled assembly of guests some standing some having remained seated

do apologize for this scene ladies and gentlemen Im dreadfully sorry you had to
witness such an embarrassment My son is a good person Hes just not well Hes
having medical treatment Please dont think badly of him for stirring things up like
this Were all so dreadfully sorry

Please do take your seats For the sake of our longstanding friendship Please do sit
down

She waits a moment to see whether the people comply with her request but then turns her
back half away from them to the refugees who are just hesitantly sitting down

(in English) Naturally we must ask you to forgive us for this terrible imposition Please
give us the pleasure of being our guests My son only meant well

She waits with Lawrence until the refugees have sat down and are served by the staff
Despite Annes efforts several people have now left the scene in the direction of the car
park

In the meantime Eve and Georges have arrived at the edge of the terrace and she is also
about to wheel him to the parked cars but Georges says

No Down the hill
Eve once more hesitates momentarily slightly puzzled Then she wheels him down the
tarmac road to the sea We follow them both

The hubbub on the terrace is coming to an end the refugees have of necessity sat down
and the guests at the party gradually return to their tables some engaged in discussion
some still dumbstruck Before the terrace goes out of view we see Lawrence and Anne
beside the refugees table Anais has left the young woman standing there and has followed
Thomas and Pierre inside the restaurant

Then the SOUNDS ON THE TERRACE almost entirely disappear and are overlaid by the
RUSHING OF THE SEA

Finally Georges and Eve have arrived at the bottom of the hill Eve stops the wheelchair
one metre from the sea SILENCE

GEORGES Go further

She understands but does nothing He half turns round to her but she remains standing
behind him He looks ahead again THE RUSHING OF THE SEA Then he says

You can go now

After a further pause she leaves Hesitantly She stops several times and looks round then
continues on up the road

He hesitates for a while then wheels himself into the water Up to his chest He stops and
looks ahead at the waves lapping up around him We see what he sees the vast expanse of
the water The camera lingers long

Eve has stopped halfway up She looks down at him She takes her mobile phone out of her
pocket lifts it up and films

Scene 46
The road to the sea ExteriorDay

Then a few people race down the road towards Georges Thomas among them Shortly
before the video ends Anne appears in the frame also running down the hill As she races
by she glances with irritation in the direction of the camera at Eve
