SEQ 0200 - THE CAMPAIGN

INT PRESCOTT HOUSE LUCKYS BEDROOM - DAYTIME

CLOSE ON PHOTO OF MILAGRO ON LUCKYS DRESSER as we pull
directly out to reveal a young bored and frustrated LUCKY
perched in the windowsill like a caged canary

One leg swinging out she shells peanuts putting them into a
pile snacking on one herself while she watches the fancy
guests arriving at the front of the mansion and listens to
the fun and laughter of the festivities in the yard

Kids laughing a band playing there’s even ice cream we
realize that she is isolated and lonely

Just then a squirrel pops into the foreground and sniffs
after Luckys snacks She is excited to see him and stretches
a hand out to the tree to try and feed the little guy a
peanut She stretches so far out we may think shes in
danger

LUCKY
Come on who’s a good squirrel
Come on Trust me Theyre

peanuts You’re favorite Come
on Tom Not even a nibble

JUST as Lucky and the squirrel are about to connect AUNT
CORA bustles into the room looking for Lucky

CORA
Lucky Lucky Lucky Where are
you

LUCKY

Ugh Aunt Cora

This sends the squirrel off in a panic and he leaves Lucky
bored frustrated and alone again She dryly shuts the curtain
behind her trying to block Cora out of her world (This
initiates the theme of this world and external forces always
interrupting Luckys chance at connecting with freedom and
the wild) Off screen we hear CHILDREN laughing and playing

CORA
Lucky Proper ladies do not hang
out of window ledges

Cora whips the drapes open and reveals her unimpressed look
While Lucky slumps and makes faces as Cora talks
SPIRIT UNTAMED - MPAA Screening - 01-29-21

LUCKY
Proper ladies also get to go to
amazing fun parties

Lucky closes the drapes on Cora She opens them again

CORA
Your grandfather is running for
Governor Lucky It’s a bit more
important than an ‘amazing fun
party Do I need to remind you of
what happened at the last event

LUCKY
Mistakes were made

CORA
Mistakes indeed

CORA (CONTD)
Youre not missing anything
besides-

Lucky whips the drapes shut again in frustration and
defiance

LUCKY
Cake

LUCKY (CONTD)
Other kids-

CORA
Lucky

LUCKY

Fun an elephant Come on

Off screen an elephant noise is heard Lucky pleads Aunt
Cora sighs on the other side of the curtain and opens it
again

CORA
I know living with Grandpa isn’t
easy But part of being a Prescott
is not always having what you want
but doing whats best for the
family

Lucky whips the drapes closed again Cora is done playing
she opens the curtains again
SPIRIT UNTAMED - MPAA Screening - 01-29-21

CORA (CONT’D)
Now come down from there and finish
your math lesson If this new tutor
of yours has one more nervous
breakdown

Cora helps Lucky back in from the ledge and shuts the window
behind her

Lucky sits down at her desk flips open her math book and
sighs

Cora tidies the room as she makes her way to Lucky and places
a comforting hand on Luckys shoulder looking sympathetic

LUCKY
If a train travelling twenty-five
miles per hour leaves the station
at eight AM ugh when will I
ever need to know this

JAMES SR (0OS)
Cora Cora Cora Coraaa

CORA
(calling out to him)
Yes father

Just then Grandpa rushes into the room

JAMES SR
This is an emergency

Cora nods yes as Grandpa and ties the tie for him
JAMES SR (CONTD)
My tie Oh no too tight Just
think of it Cora from Railroad
Baron to Governor

Lucky sighs

JAMES SR (CONT’D)

He looks at Lucky expectantly

JAMES SRLUCKY
Prescotts never give up

James Sr nods to Lucky approvingly

JAMES SR
That a girl
SPIRIT UNTAMED - MPAA Screening - 01-29-21

With that Grandpa and Cora exit We hear Grandpa whisper to
Cora with a nervous glance over his shoulder at Lucky

JAMES SR (CONT’D)
Are you sure we shouldnt put a
lock on the door

The adults are gone and Lucky mutters through her math
problem when she hears a slap at the window

LUCKY
If a train has to stop every
hundred miles to refill water at
what time will the train get to--
the first water stop

Bob is back Lucky rushes to the window and throws it open The
squirrel jumps inside staring at Lucky sweetly for a
moment

LUCKY (CONT’D)
Hello Tom Oh so nice of you to
return sir

The squirrel tears into the room Lucky gasps Tom jumps from
one surface to the next knocking things over as he goes

LUCKY (CONT’D)

youre betraying my trust Tom-

The squirrel runs up the wall towards the door -- uh oh

SPIRIT UNTAMED - MPAA Screening - 01-29-21

LUCKY
Stop Stop No no no no Come
on stop Why are squirrels so
fast

The squirrel dodges Lucky scampering up the banister leading
to a pulley holding the Prescott portrait

Lucky lunges for Tom just as he runs up the pulley rope
holding up Grandpa’s portrait Lucky lunges for him grabbing
the rope and SWINGING out over the ballroom

LUCKY (CONTD)
Grandpa’s going to kill me Whoa

INT PRESCOTT EXPRESS TRAINFIRST CLASS CABIN - MORNING
Lucky sits across from Cora who reads the paper

CLOSE ON the FRONT PAGE of The Inquirer the squirrel
plastered across James Prescott’s face Cora looking on in
horror the headline Should Prescott Give Up

LUCKY
(hopeful)
Front page is good right

CORA
(reading on oh god)
Usually

LUCKY
I mean if anyone can pull off a
squirrel on his face it’s Grandpa
He has to speak to us again
eventually right Once you know
his face heals

CORA
(that’s enough)
Grandpa just needs some peace and
quiet to get his campaign back on
track We can go home at the end of
the summer

LUCKY
(feels like exile)
Why can’t we just go back to the
lake house
SPIRIT UNTAMED - MPAA Screening - 01-29-21

CORA
(admonishing look to
Lucky )
Why Because it’s still somewhat
underwater along with most of my
fondest childhood memories

LUCKY
I said I was sorry

The car door opens revealing a LADY with a LITTLE GROWLING
DOG

MRS TWINKLES
(to her dog)
Mr Twinkles what are these people
doing in our cabin

The little dog YAPS

CORA
Oh I’m terribly sorry but you must
be mistaken This is

The women angrily SHUTS the cabin door Lucky laughs

LUCKY

Mr Twinkles Did you see its
little tie He looks like he’s all
ready for the theatre or something
Wait do they have a theatre where

Lucky opens the window needing air She looks out at the
vast but very empty landscape

LUCKY (CONTD)
Or a library Or a zoo Or
anything

The newspaper Cora is holding blows into her face as she
reaches for the window

CORA

knees to get a little more comfortable in the stiff cabin

(trying it on for size)
Jim “Hello Jim How have the last
ten years been Jim”

It all feels pretty awkward Cora sympathizes--

CORA
Oh honey It wasn’t easy for him
after your mom died Something --
broke in your father And he

LUCKY
Why didn’t he come with me

CORA
Sweetheart he was alone in the
wilderness with a baby He did what
he thought -- well what we all
thought -- was best

A mustached PASSENGER opens the door another interruption --

CHEVRON (W4 WRANGLER SHORT A)
(bad directions)
Oh This isn’t the bathroom

CORA
I beg your pardon

He shuts the door Lucky stifles a giggle

CORA (CONT’D)

The door opens again That’s it Cora raises her voice --

CORA (CONTD)
Oh this is a private cabin

The TRAIN CONDUCTOR closes the door quickly when Cora yells
but sneaks his head back in to tell them --

CONDUCTOR
Sorry Dining car closes in five
minutes
He leaves
CORA

Well I believe it is time for some
tea Don’t move

She stands heads for the door

CONDUCTOR (0S)
The next stop is Miradero

Cora leaves Lucky OPENS the window the sights OUTSIDE so
alluring the wind pulls Lucky’s BOW right out of her hair

LUCKY
Oh no

Lucky lunges for the bow a stream of ribbon flying away
From that focal point comes a figure Lucky breathes in
amazed it’s a WILD HORSE a MUSTANG galloping toward
the train running parallel to the tracks partially obscured
by rock formations

Lucky is MESMERIZED by this horse -- its strength and power
its majesty and sense of FREEDOM -- she gasps -- as it races
unfettered across the open plain
SPIRIT UNTAMED - MPAA Screening - 01-29-21 12

As the train curves bringing Lucky closer to the mustang
she is surprised to suddenly hears the SOUND of a hundred
hooves the mustang’s HERD revealed behind him following
his lead

LUCKY (CONTD)
Whoooooa

The alpha horse is now just outside Lucky’s window He LOOKS
AT HER his proximity AWAKENING something inside of Lucky
she lets out a small giggle this is so cool She then laughs
in amazement at the sight of the horse until the train turns
a corner and she begins to lose sight of the mustang -- Gasp
Oh no

Lucky BURSTS out of the train cabin and chases after him
through --

INT PRESCOTT EXPRESS TRAIN - TRAIN CAR - SAME

-- Pushing past people running through the aisle tracking
the horse’s every move tripping on a snakeskin boot as she
goes stirring a man (HENDRICKS) from his nap

HENDRICKS

runs by and wakes him He hits the guy next to him thinking
he hit him The men scuffle

A virtual wind tunnel Lucky holds on as she locks eyes with
that horse who seems nearly close enough to touch The train
pulls ahead again Lucky continues on to open the next train
door but sees CORA in the next car -- she draws in a sharp
breath -- and ducks to hide

She looks back at the horse and decides to GO AROUND the
OUTSIDE OF THE TRAIN She climbs out onto the side of the
train

The entitled Mrs Twinkles beats her to it giving the cake
to her DOG Cora sighs frustrated--

Annoyed Cora selects the other pastry taking a bite just as
Lucky APPEARS IN THE WINDOW behind Mrs Twinkles holding
tightly onto the train car from the outside

opens the window to get a better look

Lucky makes a final leap to land safely on the back end of
the train and holds on to the rails tightly She looks up
and sees the herd of horses lead by the mustang running
closely behind the train

LUCKY
Whoa

She leans over the railing reaching out her hand stretching
those fingertips eye to eye with the horse with freedom
when she suddenly the train hits a bump in the tracks
causing Lucky to SLIP about to topple over a HAND
grabbing her pulling her back to safety

ON HER SAVIOR a gruff voice underneath his ten-gallon hat--

HENDRICKS
Hey hey whoa Watch yourself

someone real unhappy you go diving

Cora exits the train luggage and LIVESTOCK crisscrossing in
all directions as she tries to stay out of the way We
overhear smatterings of English Spanish and Chinese

The man who had barged into the cabin previously looking for
the bathroom bursts out of the train and runs off into the
station looking for the toilet doing the pee-pee dance

CHEVRON (W4 WRANGLER SHORT A)
Oooh oooo0 (sees the bathroom)

Snips pushes Cora onto the mini-donkey’s back a little
precarious and definitely weighing Senor Carrots down

A toe-headed girl (ABIGAIL 12 in pants) STANDS UP IN HER
STIRRUPS swinging a LASSO overhead --

ABIGAIL

nice people

Snips tries to escape when he’s suddenly YANKED right off his
burrow by the perfectly aimed lasso Senor Carrots looks
around baffled by his sudden light load He keeps going

ON LUCKY fascinated by this girl as she jumps off her horse
and starts HOG-TYING her brother

Lucky stops her chipper talking mid sentence as Jim’s house
comes into view An idyllic farmhouse with lovely trees and a
porch Lucky’s transported She’s studied it in pictures but
maybe she also remembers

Lucky spots JIM (now 40) coming out of an adjacent BARN
wiping his oily hands on a cloth Lucky’s smile fades trying
to reconcile this older grease-stained and grim-faced man
with the smiling dad of her memories

At the sight of Cora Jim stops in his tracks

JIM
Cora

Cora is paused mid-bend grabbing another apple She stands
pulling herself back together at the sight of her brother

CORA
Oh Jim

Jim is perplexed His eyes widen as he spots his daughter
sitting on the front yard swing

JIM
Lucky

He doesn’t know what to do Neither does Lucky

Lucky waves awkwardly Jim looks back at Cora Silence
descends on the group but is broken when the APPLE Cora
threw earlier rolls off the roof- and hits Jim in the head
This seems to snap him out of it and he turns on the
‘Welcome’ charm as he leads them up the porch to the house

JIM (CONTD)
(laughing)
I can’t believe you guys are here
How was the trip (through gritted
teeth to Cora) I thought you guys

laugh)

Cora rolls her eyes before smiling sweetly at her brother

engraved with the name Milagro Lucky looks around amazed
stopping at a POSTER of Milagro standing on her horse Lucky
stares mesmerized She reaches up to undo her hair from the
clean and demure style she had to the free-flowing locks like
Milagro on the poster

A gust of wind blows from her open window into the dressing
room the SOUND of something turning tic-tic-tic Lucky
turns around sees a wooden contraption on a dresser

Lucky leans down to peer through the tiny EYEHOLE of a
ZOETROPE as the breeze continues to spin it

ON LUCKY’S POV MILAGRO RIDING HER HORSE IN MOTION

LUCKY
Mama

Lucky laughs to herself enthralled in the magic of this
contraption She is so focused that when she hears a horse
whinny 0S she at first thinks it is the zoetrope itself
The SOUND of a HORSE WHINNY makes the moving image seem that
much more alive

wonder is it the horse from the train

looking like he’s actually enjoying this challenge

The wranglers STRUGGLE to contain the horse pulling on the
ropes CHEVRON (W4 WRANGLER SHORT A) has climbed onto the
outside of the fense He uses it as leverage as he strains to
pull the horse towards him

Satisfied Al turns his attention back to his pressing task
disappearing back around the barn as they wranglers tie
spirit to the fence

HENDRICKS (CONTD)

slowly approaches the post he’s tied to

ON THE HORSE rearing up fighting an invisible enemy
undeniably powerful and intimidating from this point of view

The horse’s hooves thunder back down to earth his nostrils
flaring as he eyes Lucky

LUCKY

Lucky slowly reaches out and unhooks the rope from the post
The second he’s untethered he BOLTS to the opposite side of
the corral

in this wild horse

stalling to protect ‘him’) officially naming him--

again Ever

Lucky looks at Cora who hangs her head like she’s suddenly
at a funeral Lucky realizes what this is about She has to
ask--

LUCKY
But why It’s not Spirit’s fault
mom fell off a horse

It’s clear Jim does not want to go there but Lucky is not
giving up on her question as she waits for his answer

JIM
No no You don’t-you don’t know
what you’re talking about You stay
away from that horse no horses

His tone throws Lucky but she doesn’t back down and neither
does he She stands up from the table

from the post

LUCKY
Hey easy now easy It’s alright
boy All this new stuff is kind of
scary huh (to herself) I think
well be ok Trust me

Spirit REARS up Surprised Lucky stumbles back Pru comes up
and joins Lucky on the fence

PRU (0S)
Hey city girl Heyyyy Careful
This is a wild one

LUCKY
Yeah he just startled me

PRU
Uh yeah That’s because you
startled him

LUCKY

Got it (yells to Spirit) Sorry
(he spooks so she whispers) Oh
sorry

PRU
Just take it slow Horses can feel
what you feel so if you want him
to trust you you’ve got to show
him the three C’s calm confidence
-- and carrots

Pru swings off the fence and leaves Lucky to it

PRU (CONT’D)
Well you have fun See you later

Lucky doesn’t have any carrots so she pulls a POTATO out of
the pile of groceries on the ground she holds it through the
fence Spirit eyes the potato from afar not interested

SPIRIT UNTAMED - MPAA Screening - 01-29-21

LUCKY
You hungry bud

Spirit subtly turns away not interested

LUCKY (CONTD)
Yeah I don’t like to eat when I’m
mad either

Behind Lucky Abigail trots by on Boomerang and then reverse
trots back slowing as she notices

ABIGAIL
(to Lucky)
Is that a potato

LUCKY
Why Would that be bad

Lucky throws the potato behind her Abigail slides off her
horse taking pity on Lucky She pulls an apple out of
Boomerang’s saddle bag Boomerang looks at the apple and his
eyes go wide As Abigail talks to Lucky Boomerang tries to
get the apple from Abigail

ABIGAIL
You might want to try something
a little less potato-y Horses are
finicky they’ve got a real sweet
tooth

Abigail tosses the apple from hand to hand Boomerang getting
dizzy as he follows it with his eyes Then she tosses it to
Lucky Boomerang NICKERS bummed

LUCKY
Thanks That is better than a
potato

ABIGAIL

I’ve gotcha covered buddy don’t
you worry

She takes another apple out of Boomerang’s saddle bag
Abigail takes a bite of the apple Lucky watches Abigail feed
the rest of the apple to Boomerang with the palm of her hand
open and flat Boomerang slobbers and scarfs the apple down
leaving Lucky a little grossed out but grateful that Abigail
shared an apple with her Lucky chuckles a bit as she turns
away from Boomerang

LUCKY
(laughs)
Okay

SPIRIT UNTAMED - MPAA Screening - 01-29-21 49

Lucky takes the apple and holds it out to Spirit who
completely ignores her on the other side of the corral

LUCKY (CONTD)
How about this one Spirit

ABIGAIL
It’s okay You can’t rush these
things I spent a whole week
singing to Boomerang before he
would let me ride him

LUCKY
Really

Abigail takes the apple and ROLLS it into the corral halfway
between Lucky and Spirit

ABIGAIL
Well Snips said that Boomerang
only really let me ride him so that
I would stop singing But I mean
I-I dunno Point is it’s-it’s just
these things take time

Abigail takes the apple and ROLLS it into the corral halfway
between Lucky and Spirit

LUCKY
Well I have plenty of that

ABIGAIL
See ya later

Abigail jumps back on Boomerang and heads into the stables

Lucky leans on the fence as Spirit eats the apple She yells
loudly to celebrate but it spooks Spirit back to the other

side of the corral

LUCKY
Oh yes Oh no No Sorry

Realizing her misstep Lucky climbs off the fence and makes
herself smaller

Spirit paws the ground as if asking for more apples now that
they have an understanding

Lucky enthusiastically seizes the moment and grabs her
groceries before running back home with an idea

EXT MIRADERO - GRANGER CORRAL - A LITTLE LATER

Lucky grabs two apples from an apple tree and runs back
towards the corral

At the corral Spirit tries to entertain himself by chewing on
the fence Lucky rolls one apple in and keeps the other in
her hand flat like Abigail had done to feed Boomerang She
waits Spirit eats the first apple but doesn’t approach for
the one in her hand

She looks at him perplexed then looks to Abigail who
gestures to her to ‘just give it time’

As she trains with Chica Linda nearby Pru shakes her head at
the whole thing

Lucky eats the apple and heads back home Spirit approaches
the fence as soon as Lucky leaves

Hendricks and his men approach the corral ready to continue
their work but Spirit is not how he was left Hendricks
watches Lucky leave

CHEVRON(W4 WRANGLER SHORT A) (0S)
Gee willikers how’d he get loose

Lucky looks back towards the corral as she heads home

EXT JIMS HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

Lucky runs to the barrel full of apples and loads up her bag
as Cora watches from the window eating her breakfast

A huge BANG and some smoke come from Jim’s workshop He walks
out of the barn and tries to say something to Lucky but she
barely acknowledges him and runs off

JIM
Hey what are you up to Oh

Despondent Jim goes back into the barn Cora rolls her eyes
from the window

EXT MIRADERO - GRANGER CORRAL - A LITTLE LATER

Lucky gets to the corral unties Spirit and rolls three
apples inside She keeps a fourth in her hand She waits for
Spirit as he begins eating the apples in the corral

After the third he is so close to the fence Lucky can’t
contain herself She reaches out and tries to touch Spirit
but he bolts to the other side of the corral He’s not ready
SPIRIT UNTAMED - MPAA Screening - 01-29-21

Lucky slumps in defeat Abigail comes out of the barn
ukulele in hand and sits with Lucky by the fence Pru puts
down her work and joins the other girls She’s impressed by
Lucky’s perseverance and is finally as invested in Lucky
succeeding as Abigail

Lucky sighs and rolls the apple between her hands as she
waits

CROSS DISSOLVE
Lucky sits in the same position as she waits for Spirit to
come towards her As the day wears on Abigail and Pru leave

Lucky but she still waits

CROSS DISSOLVE

Lucky’s eyelids droop as she falls asleep still holding the
apple Rain begins to fall

ON SPIRIT watching Lucky

ON ABIGAIL as she and Pru stand in the barn She slides off
Boomerang to get a blanket for Lucky but Pru stops her

Spirit walks towards Lucky
ON LUCKY sleeping as a figure shelters her from the rain
Spirit now much closer

Lucky stirs from her sleep realizing Spirit is within reach
She very slowly carefully reaches out with the apple in
hand He very slowly carefully takes it from her OPEN PALM
(like Abigail taught her) the apple disappearing

MONTAGE ENDS

Abigail and Pru approach with the blanket covering the from

the rain They give Lucky her space as she finally connects

with Spirit laughing and celebrating in the BG sharing a
moment of celebration for Lucky

PRU ABIGAIL
Yes

ABIGAIL
You did it

Off Lucky smiling at the BREAKTHROUGH she’s finally made as
they stare at each other in the rain Abigail and Pru come up
to her and cover her with the blanket as they watch Spirit

From under the protection of the tree a shadowy figure
watches Hendricks smiles - this girl just did all the work
for him breaking this horse He takes a giant bite of apple

Lucky in her new pants and sash approaches the corral
humming Milagro’s theme She slowly climbs over the fence
entering Spirit’s territory No one around except him

Spirit just looks at her Lucky jumps down her first time in

the corral as she takes a step toward Spirit

Spirit steps back HUFFS unsure Lucky pauses Takes another
step Spirit is not a fan

LUCKY
Easy boy

She approaches him again He neighs warning her

LUCKY (CONTD)
It’s okay

Lucky continues to walk towards him Spirit runs around the
corral away from Lucky

Spirit circles the corral Lucky turns and walks towards him
again and he immediately turns and runs right back to where
he started

LUCKY (CONTD)
Easy boy easy

He pauses for a moment Lucky takes advantage of this and
takes another step closer to him Spirit rears up and runs
away once again

LUCKY (CONTD)
(disappointed)
Oh

Lucky takes a deep breath and ON LUCKY’S SHOES takes one
step forward

ON SPIRITS HOOVES takes one step back

Lucky begins to take another step forward hesitates then
ultimately takes one step BACK

Spirit a little confused by this takes one step forward

Lucky gasps in excitement a breakthrough They circle each
other like dance partners sizing each other up --

Spirit turns and circles the corral clockwise Lucky follows
and circles clockwise from the other side Spirit turns
counter-clockwise and Lucky follows suit

SPIRIT UNTAMED - MPAA Screening - 01-29-21 54

Lucky takes a step left Spirit takes a step right Lucky
takes a step right Spirit takes a step left Lucky takes one
step closer to Spirit and he takes a step backwards

to walk towards her Lucky strategically slows down and
eventually comes to a stop but Spirit keeps walking until
they are a few feet apart

ON LUCKY AND SPIRIT eye-to-eye

LUCKY (CONTD)
Oh I’ve got something for you

Lucky reaches in her pocket and pulls out a sugar cube
Spirit sniffs it cautiously before eating the whole thing all
at once

LUCKY (CONTD)
Whoa Not my whole hand

Lucky holds her hand up hoping to pet him but Spirit is
only interested in another treat and searches her hand for
more As Lucky slowly reaches out to touch his neck he
circles around her still looking for treats and sniffing her
as she turns

LUCKY (CONTD)

(giggles)
Hey

Lucky laughs then slowly reaches out her hand to TOUCH HIM
but Spirit pulls back Lucky doesn’t retreat slowly reaching
out again This time Spirit stays still letting her touch
his neck for two seconds before turning that’s enough

LUCKY (CONTD)
It’s okay It’s okay easy boy
easy

She peeks up around his back before placing her hands on his
side Spirit whinnies and backs away

She holds out her hands to show him he’s safe He sniffs for
a moment then huffs blowing her hair back She laughs

LUCKY (CONT’D)
Hey

She blows back at him jokingly before walking around to his
side once again She takes a step closer he takes a step
away She takes a step back he moves in closer

Lucky reaches for Spirit’s mane swinging her leg up when
Spirit suddenly MOVES knocking her on her butt

LUCKY (CONT’D)
Alright so that’s how it’s gonna
be
FROM THE GROUND Lucky laughs good-naturedly dusting off

LUCKY (CONTD)

brushes against the canyon wall sending rocks spraying

legs

Lucky tries but just can’t get traction as Spirit weaves
along the curves of the canyon

Or just hang on and whatever you
do don’t look down

As more rocks go flying over the edge Lucky glances down--

Abigail left hand swinging her toward Pru who grabs her
right as Boomerang and Chica Linda SCREECH TO A HALT sending

over the chasm landing safely on the other side while Lucky
lands behind Pru on the back of Chica Linda as--

Spirit bolts around the corner disappearing from view

rushes to her--

relieved) emotions now surfacing as Lucky shares excitedly--

Cora steps into the hallway carrying a box realizing this is
an argument She slowly steps back so as not to interfere
SPIRIT UNTAMED - MPAA Screening - 01-29-21 64

and by the way you can’t just come

youre seeing it now but she won’t give Jim the
satisfaction She turns and looks him right in the eye

interpretation He moves to the stairs to plead his case--

But all he gets is a view of her back

fireflies dance around Lucky as she laughs softly watching

Lucky takes in the deep woods as mysterious SOUNDS grow
around her from all directions the sounds of animals the
‘whoosh’ of wind and her heart quickening A HOWL from

Lucky turns GASPING at the silhouette of a COYOTE atop a
mound of boulders until her eyes adjust revealing a rock
formation in the moonlight Lucky lets out a sigh of relief
as she climbs the boulders peering over the top revealing a

something else approaching

Oh I hope I brought enough Here

Lucky rolls another apple right to DAISY who’s faster on the
uptake this time with a satisfied look to Chubs
SPIRIT UNTAMED - MPAA Screening - 01-29-21

Lucky turns to the horses BEHIND her rolling an apple to
each of them

The horses move in closer to Lucky a kind of INITIATION OF
TRUST which Lucky feels humbled by

A FOAL suddenly steps from behind his mom’s haunches peeking
at Lucky with curious eyes

LUCKY (CONTD)
Aww I have one just your size
Don’t be shy

Lucky digs into her bag worried it’s empty relieved when--

She holds up a runt of an apple about to roll it when the
foal trots right up to Lucky and eats FROM HER HAND taking
Lucky by surprise As the foal looks up at Lucky with the
cutest expression--

LUCKY (CONTD)
Hello Little Brave One

The foal seems happy about that trotting back to his mom
with an extra bounce of ‘pride’

Just as the foal reaches his mom Lucky notices Spirit’s
demeanor change his ears UP as he listens carefully

LUCKY (CONTD)
W-what’s wrong

Spirit breathes heavily adrenaline spiking when--

Chica Linda REACTS

Pru rolls a handmade map out over a nearby saddle Pru points
around on her map as she explains

PRU
Okay Let me show you exactly how
impossible it is Hendricks and his
men are headed for a boat up here
at the docks on a speeding train
and we’re down here with horses
It’s too far

Lucky traces her finger over the mountain to the water depot
on the map

LUCKY
What if we take a shortcut over
this big pointy thingy

PRU
That big pointy thing -- is Heck

on horseback That’s a full day and
most of the night’s ride And even
if by some miracle we did make it
how are we supposed to get the
horses off of a moving train

miles an hour has to stop every one

The sound of a ukulele strums ominously off screen Lucky and
Pru look to the back of the dark barn Abigail (on Boomerang)
stalks out of the shadows Ukulele in hand

ABIGAIL
From what I hear there’s a lotta
dangers lurking around those parts
Dangers that only those with good
fortune RETURN from

Ive heard tales The most
treacherous and merciless creatures
hiding in the shadows Creatures

Abigail grabs the lantern in front of Pru and Lucky and
begins to make intricate shadow puppets

ABIGAIL (CONTD)
There’s a moose and he’s
a’waitin’ but he doesn’t know what
he’s waitin’ for

Lucky and Pru share another big look as Abigail sets down the
lantern and gets more involved in her shadow puppets

LUCKY
Uh how is she

ABIGAIL
And they say at the bottom of a
bridge is a shifty fox Who’s just

sitting there being shifty And
then there’s a possum that just
hangs out lighting matches Ha-ha-

By the end of her rant everyone including the horses are
staring at Abigail Abigail is completely tangled in her arms
and legs but finally sees she shadow creation -- she scares
herself and YELPS She falls over and knocks the lantern

what Abigail is TRYING to say is
it’s way too dangerous

own

Lucky leaves without hearing Pru’s SIGH Pru picks up her
saddle heading back to Chica Linda

Abigail begins to worry about Lucky out there alone

look uncomfortable

Yeah but like not so

posture makes a noise to
go along with her

He really talks about me that much

Lucky takes all of this in Pru and Abigail nod

Sometimes my dad pretends he has to
go to the bathroom just to get your
dad to stop talking about you

The girls find themselves in a canyon and hear a moose CALL
in the distance

ABIGAIL
See I told you there was a moose
waiting

Lucky and Pru share a look and laugh as the group comes to a
ravine

Here it is we cross this bridge
and then it’s a straight shot up
the mountain to the water depot

The bridge is a threadbare SUSPENSION BRIDGE

It’s fine Suspension bridges are

built to support incredible weights-

Lucky’s shoulders slump Pru and Chica Linda turn around
back toward Miradero

attempting this

Lucky looks back and forth between them

LUCKY
I can do it

She looks back at the chasm and GULPS --

PRU
I don’t know if this is a good
idea

Spirit flares his nostrils he’s ready Lucky is clearly
doubting herself but he charges on headstrong as ever --

LUCKY
Ahh

PRU
No-- Lucky Wait

As they charge toward the edge Pru coaches Lucky on --

PRU (CONTD)
Ok umm I guess we’re doing this
All right Don’t look down don’t
pull back and just trust him

Spirit’s in top form but Lucky doubts herself and looks down
just as they reach the edge

Pru and Chica Linda break into a gallop with Lucky and Spirit
next to them heading straight toward the platform As they
reach the edge Pru leans forward and relaxes her grip
trusting Chica Linda The horse vaults up -- up -- up and
onto the platform

Spirit and Lucky are about to land next to Pru and Chica
Linda but Lucky tenses up and grabs Spirit’s neck When she
tensed Spirit did too They’re short Spirit’s hooves
clatter on the edge but the two fall from the platform

scrabble on the boulder

stumbled when she doubts herself Pru looks down at where

mumbles unsure

along to the song as she joins Lucky on the ridge

pebbles falling from under the horses feet with each gentle
step

you

Jim stares in wonder at his daughter

JIM (CONTD)

The PALS LAUGH and CHEER in celebration as they gallop off on
their horses

SEQ 2600 - SETTING SPIRIT FREE

EXT WOODED PARADISE - CONTINUOUS

Lucky rides feeling utterly free the wind at her back and
at her side Pru and Abigail ride their exuberance beyond
words their bond set for life They gallop on their horses
toward the WOODED PARADISE AHEAD

The girls CHEER and celebrate their success and the herd’s
freedom Abigail narrowly ducks under a branch

ABIGAIL
(laughing)
Woah I almost died

PRU
Eyes on the road Abigail

Our three girls lead the herd through flora and fauna no
other human as far as the eye can see the LUSH BEAUTY of the
raw land something each of our riders appreciate in her own
way

Through the path they jump over a fallen tree No obstacle
big or small can stop them after all they’ve been through
Even the foal scampers over the log his mother close behind

EXT PARADISE OVERLOOK - A LITTLE LATER

Perched over an expanse of forest that leads to the VAST
WILDERNESS beyond the girls take stock of their
surroundings

ABIGAIL
Wow look at this place

PRU
This is it Nothing but wilderness
for miles

Lucky absorbs that overwhelmed by both the stunning vista
and what ‘this is it’ means A quiet beat then --

Lucky guides Spirit forward just the two of them
SPIRIT UNTAMED - MPAA Screening - 01-29-21 122

LUCKY
Well Spirit I guess it’s time for
me to go

Spirit gives a little shake of his head as if sensing what’s
coming He doesn’t want her to go Lucky looks back at the
herd

LUCKY (CONTD)
Your herd needs you

She slides off his back the end of the road She takes a
deep breath fighting tears She slowly turns and walks back
toward Abigail and Pru

CLOSE ON LUCKY the SOUND of hooves clip-clopping behind her
a nudge to her back horse-speak for don’t go

Lucky turns around looking into Spirit’s eyes Spirit
prances around encouraging her for more adventures together
Lucky’s face falls hating to disappoint her new best friend
He neighs as he nudges her face

LUCKY (CONT’D)
I’m sorry boy but I I can’t go
with you my herd needs me too

Spirit seems to understand He steps forward into her and
Lucky throws her arms around him to give him one last hug
Spirit takes a step back and Lucky lets go of him Spirit
looks from Lucky to the wilderness before him

Lucky suddenly feels something touch her leg She looks down
The foal has nuzzled up against her Lucky smiles bending
down eye-to-eye whispering to her little foal friend --

LUCKY (CONTD)
Stay fearless Brave One

Spirit watches then rears back letting out an ALPHA NEIGH
that pulls everyone’s attention to him a call to his herd as
he turns toward the open wilderness and begins to run

The mama horse circles around the PALs and gives Lucky one
last nudge as if to say thank you before running off with
her family

ABIGAIL
Bye Mama Take care of the little
one
SPIRIT UNTAMED - MPAA Screening - 01-29-21 123

Lucky Pru and Abigail watch this powerful embodiment of
unbridled freedom as Spirit’s herd runs past him a stampede
of hooves Spirit stops for a moment giving one last look to
Lucky before running off into the wild

They watch the herd go mission accomplished
WIDE ON THE HERD as they run over the rolling hills

Lucky sniffs and draws in a breath on the verge of tears

at her PALs bracelet

Cora’s bright demeanor momentarily cracks slightly but she
keeps up her chipper face for her niece

CORA (0S) (CONTD)
We’ll come to visit more now At
the holidays And next summer

Lucky heads inside and packs the strawberry toy into her
suitcase

Cora tries to come up with reasons to be cheerful

CORA (CONTD)
And there’s still the big festival
tonight Your father’s probably
wondering what’s taking us so
long

Lucky nods Cora is just as disappointed as Lucky She
doesn’t want to play this old role anymore or go back to the
way things were either But Cora plasters on a happy face for
her niece’s sake as she holds up two dresses (They’re the
city dresses we saw Lucky wear earlier in the movie)
SPIRIT UNTAMED - MPAA Screening - 01-29-21 124

in the closet

The crowd cheers Lucky can’t help but chuckle at her dad

JIM (CONTD)
This song’s for you Lucky Your
mother sang it much sweeter than I
ever could but welcome home

Jims heart swells -- this is his moment His veneer cracks
and he sings “Fearless” the Milagro Song He starts out
timidly his voice small but then Jim FINALLY lets go His
voice is just awful but all his bottled up love for his
daughter -- all the things he doesn’t know how to say --
burst out through the song

JIM (CONTD)
Listen to the wind roar See the
mighty eagle soar
The crowd audibly cringes Lucky watches in amazement

We move through the crowd finding all of our characters

Abigail stands with Snips on her shoulders and Senor Carrots
nearby

Whoa Mister Lucky’s dad is a
really bad singer Take me closer

the crowd the horses stamping their feet along with the
song
