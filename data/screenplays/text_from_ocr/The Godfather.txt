INT DON CORLEONES HOME OFFICE — DAY

BONASERA

(seated in front of the

Dons desk facing the

camera)
I believe in America America has made my
fortune And I raised my daughter in the
American fashion I gave her freedom but
I taught her never to dishonor her family
She found a boyfriend not an Italian She
went to the movies with him she stayed
out late I didnt protest Two months
ago he took her for a drive with another
boyfriend They made her drink whiskey
And then they tried to take advantage of
her She resisted She kept her honor So
they beat her like an animal When I went
to the hospital her nose was abroken
Her jaw was ashutted held together by
wire She couldnt even weep because of
the pain But I wept Why did I weep She
was the light of my life beautiful
girl Now she will never be beautiful
again

Bonasera breaks down The Don gestures to Sonny to give Bonasera a
drink

BONASERA
Sorry

Bonasera taking the drink sips from the shot glass

BONASERA
I-I went to the police like a good
American These two boys were brought to
trial The judge sentenced them to three
years in prison suspended sentence
Suspended sentence They went free that
very day I stood in the courtroom like a
fool And those two bastard they smiled
at me Then I said to my wife for
justice we must go to Don Corleone

VITO CORLEONE
(sitting behind his desk
petting a cat)
Why did you go to the police Why didnt
you come to me first
BONASERA
What do you want of me Tell me anything
But do what I beg you to do

VITO CORLEONE
What is that

Bonasera gets up to whisper his request into Don Corleones ear

VITO CORLEONE
That I cannot do

BONASERA
Ill give you anything you ask

VITO CORLEONE
Weve known each other many years but
this is the first time you came to me for
counsel for help I cant remember the
last time that you invited me to your
house for a cup of coffee even though my
wife is godmother to your only child But
lets be frank here you never wanted my
friendship And uh you were afraid to be
in my debt

BONASERA
I didnt want to get into trouble

VITO CORLEONE
I understand You found paradise in
America had a good trade made a good
living The police protected you and
there were courts of law And you didnt
need a friend of me But uh now you come
to me and you say Don Corleone give me
justice But you dont ask with respect
You dont offer friendship You dont even
think to call me Godfather Instead you
come into my house on the day my daughter
is to be married and you uh ask me to do
murder for money

BONASERA
I ask you for justice

VITO CORLEONE
That is not justice your daughter is
still alive

BONASERA
Then they can suffer then as she suffers
(then)
How much shall I pay you
VITO CORLEONE

(stands turning his back

toward Bonasera)
Bonasera Bonasera What have I ever
done to make you treat me so
disrespectfully Had you come to me in
friendship then this scum that ruined
your daughter would be suffering this very
day And that by chance if an honest man
such as yourself should make enemies then
they would become my enemies And then
they would fear you

BONASERA
Be my friend
(after bowing and the Don
shrugs)
Godfather

VITO CORLEONE

(after Bonasera kisses his

hand)
Good

(then)
Some day and that day may never come
Ill call upon you to do a service for me
But uh until that day accept this justice
as a gift on my daughters wedding day

BONASERA
(as he leaves the room)
Grazie Godfather

VITO CORLEONE

dollars on her I was gonna make her a big
star And let me be even more frank just
to show you that Im not a hard-hearted
man and its not all dollars and cents
She was beautiful she was young she was
innocent She was the greatest piece of
ass I ever had and I hadem all over the
world And then Johnny Fontane comes along
with his olive-oil voice and guinea
charm And she runs off She threw it all
away just to make me look ridiculous And

WOLTZ (Cont’d)
aman in my position cant afford to be
made to look ridiculous Now you get the
hell outta here And if that gumbah tries

understand Sonny is that while Sollozzo
is being guarded like this he is
invulnerable Now nobody has ever gunned
down a New York police captainnever It
would be disastrous All the Five Families
would come after you Sonny The Corleone
Family would be outcasts Even the old

DISSOLVE TO
BANK BUILDING BOARDROOM — NEW YORK CITY — DAY

There are Dons and aides seated and standing around a conference
table Barzini sits at the head of the table

VITO CORLEONE

Don Barzini I want to thank you for
helping me organize this meeting here
today And also the other heads of the
Five Families New York and New Jersey
Carmine Corleone from the Bronx and ah
BrooklynPhilip Tattaglia An from
Staten Island we have with us Victor
Strachi And all the other associates that
came as far as from California and Kansas
City and all the other territories of the
countrythank you

(sitting down)
How did things ever get so far I dont
know It was so unfortunateso
unnecessary Tattaglia lost a son and I
lost a son Were quits And if Tattaglia
agrees then Im willing to let things go
on the way they were before

BARZINI
Were all grateful to Don Corleone for
calling this meeting We all know him as a
man of his worda modest manhell
always listen to reason

TATTAGLIA
Yes Don Barzinihes too modest He had
all the judges and politicians in his
pocket He refused to share them

VITO CORLEONE
Whenwhen did I ever refuse an
accommodation All of you know me here
When did I ever refuse Except one time
And why Because I believe this drug
business is gonna destroy us in the years
to come I mean its not like gambling or
liquoreven women which is something
that most people want nowadays and is ah
forbidden to them by the pezzonovante of
the Church Even the police departments
thatve helped us in the past with
gambling and other things are gonna refuse
to help us when in comes to narcotics And
I believed that then and I believe that
now

BARZINI
Times have changed Its not like the Old
Days when we can do anything we want A
refusal is not the act of a friend If Don
Corleone had all the judges and the
politicians in New York then he must
share them or let us others use them He
must let us draw the water from the well
Certainly he can present a bill for such
services after all we are not Communists

ZALUCHI
(after some laughter from
the group stands)
I also dont believe in drugs For years I
paid my people extra so they wouldnt do
that kind of business

Tattaglia whispers something to his aide

ZALUCHI

(continues )
Somebody comes to them and says I have
powders if you put up three four
thousand dollar investment we can make
fifty thousand distributing So they
cant resist I want to control it as a
business to keep it respectable

(as he slams his hand on the

table)
I dont want it near schools I dont want
it sold to children Thats an infamia In
my city we would keep the traffic in the
dark people — the colored Theyre animals
anyway so let them lose their souls

VITO CORLEONE
I hoped that we would come here and reason
together And as a reasonable man Im
willing to do whatevers necessary to find
a peaceful solution to these problems

BARZINI
Then we are agreed The traffic in drugs
will be permitted but controlled and Don
Corleone will give up protection in the
East and there will be the peace

TATTAGLIA
But I must have strict assurance from
Corleone as time goes by and his position
becomes stronger will he attempt any
individual vendetta
BARZINI

Look we are all reasonable men here we

don

t have to give assurances as if we

were lawyers

You

VITO CORLEONE
(holding up his hand to
interrupt Barzini)
talk about vengeanceis vengeance

gonna bring your son back to you Or my

boy
But
son

to me I forgo the vengeance of my son

I have selfish reasons My youngest

was forced to leave this country
(as he stands with Toms
assistance)

Because of this Sollozzo business All
right and I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely — cleared of

all

these false charges But Ima

superstitious man and if some unlucky
accident should befall himif he should

get

shot in the head by a police officer

or if he should hang himself in his jail
cell or if hes struck by a bolt of
lightning then Im going to blame some of

the
not

But
the
not

people in this room And that I do
forgive

(then)
that aside let me say that I swear on
souls of my grandchildren that I will
be the one to break the peace that we

have made here today
