INT TV MONITOR — NIGHT

TIGHT ON a SMALL 43 RATIO FRAMED-IN-BLACK VIDEO IMAGE
of a news telecast Except there’s no one there -- just
the empty newsdesk Odd

Suddenly a NEWSCASTER appears behind the desk -- forty-
five rushed and unkempt Fumbles with his clip mic
hands trembling It’s unsettling as he tries desperately
to sound confident But his voice shakes -- the SOUND
TINNY as if from a TV

NEWSCASTER

Ladies and gentlemen if you’re
watching this and not taking
shelter underground we urge you
to do so immediately -- anywhere --
anywhere you can find

(then trembling)
Just a month ago this report
would’ve seemed ludicrous
Aliens using Earth as a
battleground

(wants to cry but

he’s a pro)
- but that was before Superman

Something urgent is YELLED from behind the camera -- our
Newscaster looks off terrified -- he yells something
back but it’s masked by a SHATTERING -- FLYING GLASS --
the video camera SHAKES --

A TERRIBLE WHISTLE then an EXPLOSION -- everything is
WHIPPED OUT OF FRAME in the same horrible instant the
screen goes to STATIC --

EXT METROPOLIS - DAY

-- the SCREEN EXPANDS to 2351 -- ANAMORPHIC RATIO --
and the SOUND EXPLODES in POWERHOUSE DOLBY as SOMETHING
EXPLODES through the TV NETWORK building -- a BLUR of RED
AND BLUE and it SLAMS INTO THE STREET like a meteor --
KKRABOOOOOOOM A CRATER is blown into a street already
littered with pieces of concrete and steel -- the
confetti of PAPERWORK flitters everywhere

And then with a WOOOOSH and thunderous THUD a FIGURE
LANDS Human form but this being is far from human
Dressed in dark unearthly clothing he’s a gorgeous
specimen his black eyes dramatic contrast to his pale
skin Powerful Well-trained This is TY-ZOR

( )

Confident and controlling as he reaches down and grabs
his nemesis -- someone we do not yet see -- and in a blur
Ty-Zor HURLS HIM --

Another BLUERED STREAK in the sky as the figure Ty-Zor
has thrown SLAMS INTO A ROW OF PARKED CARS -- the cars
EXPLODE tossed into the air like kicked dominos -- a
hundred-yard divot RIPPED into the pavement

Momentary silence save for some distant SIRENS Then
in the rubble something stirs The CAMERA LOW looking
back at Ty-Zor a block away as the thrown figure
struggles to rise in the FOREGROUND We don’t really see
him yet -- he’s obscured by a shock of RED A cape
Uneasily PAINFULLY he gets to his feet as the CAMERA
STARTS TO MOVE AROUND to the FRONT of the boots -- SLOWLY
RISING DRAMATICALLY REVEALING the body of a twenty-nine-
year-old warrior in brilliant red and blue But the

iconic suit is SHREDDED in areas -- his cape billowing
but SLASHED -- an icon on his muscular chest resembling
an “S” He’s bloody winded beaten He’s as exhausted

as Ty-Zor is strong confident cocky
TY-ZOR
I’m disappointed I expected a
better fight

Then Superman HEARS SOMETHING in the far-off distance --
something no mortal could hear a MUFFLED FEMALE VOICE

FEMALE VOICE (0S)

- SUPERMAN HELLLL--
-- a voice SUDDENLY inexplicably SILENCED We’re TIGHT
ON SUPERMANS FACE as he reacts to this -- the voice
FAMILIAR to him -- deeply concerning him -- and he

suddenly LEAPS INTO THE SKY FLYING OFF Ty-Zor watches
him go Smiles

EXT SKY - DAY

CAMERA SHAKES MADLY keeping up with Superman who flies

vigorously -- his heart pounding as he speeds through the
sky EXCEEDING THE SPEED OF SOUND SONIC BOOMS SHAKE THE
WORLD -- it’s DEAFENING -- and we CUT TO the SILENCE OF

EXT KELVIN OBSERVATORY —- NIGHT

An old observatory miles from the city Giant domed
building tall security fences From nowhere a growing
WOOOOOOSH and SUPERMAN LANDS MIGHTILY Alone He
BULLETS to the observatory building entrance --
INT KELVIN OBSERVATORY CORRIDOR —- DAY

Superman FLIES down the corridor -- WHIP PAN as he passes
us and arrives at the main door which he RIPS AWAY --
INT KELVIN OBSERVATORY - DAY

TIGHT ON SUPERMANS FACE -- his eyes wide with terror at

what he sees -- although we don’t see what it is we can
guess And Superman almost GASPS

SUPERMAN
-- no--
His skin begins to BLISTER -- he falls to his knees
shattering the marble floor as if it were sand -- and he
GASPS -- opening his eyes -- ROLLED BACK WHITE -- a

SHOCKING MOMENT AND WE SMASH CUT TO
A FLOWER

Unlike any we’ve ever seen Then a CLOSE-UP OF A FIVE-
YEAR-OLD GIRL The picture of innocence she sits on the
ground gathering flowers Her hair moves in a soft
breeze PULL BACK TO REVEAL

EXT KRYPTONIAN FIELD —- DAY

A massive LONG SHOT An endless field awash in a
CRIMSON GLOW on this planet their sun is red There’s
a nearby ridge Pipelines and security bunkers Pod-
like DWELLINGS dot the alien landscape

WORDS APPEAR “MENNA KRYPTON 29 YEARS EARLIER”

TIGHT AGAIN on the little girl sitting in the field

She picks another flower She’s so adorable you could
almost watch her forever Then her head snaps she hears
something we do not

A moment later we feel it a deep powerful distant
RUMBLE She stands Looks off worried The RUMBLING

GROWS -- something gargantuan is coming
Then something horrifying THE SKY DISTORTS -- RIPPLING

like liquid as if a stone had been tossed through it
The Girl’s face grows in panic as the sky suddenly begins
to CORRODE -- A YELLOWISH ACID EATING AWAY FROM THE
CENTER OF THE RIPPLE EXPANDING OUTWARD LIKE A VIRUS
WE’RE WITNESSING THE DESTRUCTION OF A PROTECTIVE FORCE
FIELD THAT HAS UNTIL TODAY DEFENDED THIS LAND --

( )

-- as the HOLE RIPS in the sky -- with a DEAFENING ROAR --
DOZENS OF THE SCARIEST WARBIRDS YOU’VE EVER SEEN APPEAR
tearing through the still-expanding breach These flying
tank-like battle machines are called “BUZZARDS” --

And the terrified girl runs -- holy shit does she run --
SCREAMING -- as BURIED DEFENSE TURRETS RISE TURN AND
FIRE The BUZZARDS FIRE BACK -- suddenly this little

girl is sprinting through a perilous WARZONE --
EXPLOSIONS STONE and DIRT everywhere She CRIES in
KRYPTONIAN

KRYPTONIAN GIRL

DAMA-SO KALA-SO
And up ahead one of the swelling TURRETS OPENS -- a man -
- her FATHER -- yells for her moves for her -- he grabs

her they duck into the turret which closes just as
behind them giant EXPLOSIONS which OVERWHELM THE FRAME
AND WE GO TO SHOCKING WHITE --

EXT KANDOR —- DAY

-- and we realize the WHITE is CLOUDS which we DIVE
THROUGH revealing a majestic Kryptonian city far from
Menna This is a kingdom ruled by a great leader who
lives in the building we now quickly approach KANDOR
PALACE In the same shot we land in the MAIN GARDEN --

INT KANDOR GARDEN CORRIDOR - DAY

-- and CAMERA CONTINUES racing behind a sprinting
OFFICER through the incredible space He turns a
corner crying out to a group of SIX MEN who move down
the hall -- the alarmed Officer speaks KRYPTONIAN which
we SUBTITLE

OFFICER
Sir the barrier’s been broken --
they’ve crossed the border into
Menna THEY’RE COMING

Five of these men are stunned -- PUSH IN on the fifth
Their KING A rugged 39 year-old man strong of body and
character Unshaken This is JOR-EL SMASH CUT TO

INT KANDOR WAR ROOM —- DAY

PANIC the bustling command center of their military
Two dozen LIEUTENANTS talk over each other manning their
stations

( )

THREE DIMENSIONAL HOLOGRAPHS are everywhere of the
attacking enemy -- translucent BUZZARDS and TROOPS
Complex GLYPHS and DIAGRAMS give crucial data OUR
CAMERA DOESNT STOP MOVING as Jor-El bursts in taking in
the information as a Lieutenant reports to him still in
SUBTITLED KRYPTONIAN

LIEUTENANT
They attacked from the east and
the south Our defenses were
destroyed

Jor-El stares at the images his heart sinking -- and we
PUSH IN ON HIM as Jor-El realizes that this is the day he
had been dreading for so long

LIEUTENANT (CONT’D)
Sir tell me you see a way out

The Lieutenant remains fixed on his leader hoping for a
miracle Finally Jor-El speaks mostly to himself A
contemplative voice (NOTE JOR-EL SPEAKS ENGLISH -- FROM
THIS POINT THE ONLY LANGUAGE WE HEAR ON KRYPTON)

JOR-EL
- yes But the solution I
have is for another day

His eyes flick to a HOLOGRAM OF AN ATTACKING BUZZARD --
WHICH TRANSITIONS US TO --

EXT KANDOR KRYPTON —- DAY

-- an ACTUAL BUZZARD firing PLASMA BLASTS at a distant
200-STORY TOWER The TOWER EXPLODES -- the Buzzard
boldly flying THROUGH THE EXPLOSION as the structure
COLLAPSES And we WHIP PAN with the Buzzard as it LEADS
OTHER BUZZARDS toward the center of Kandor firing PLASMA
BLASTS into the city heading toward the great palace
TURRETS in the city FIRE BACK at the attackers

EXT KANDOR STREET —- DAY

As Kandorians retreat terrified Jor-El’s troops FIRE
WEAPONS up at the overwhelming enemy --

INT LAUNCH CHAMBER CORRIDOR - DAY

Jor-El hurries with his wife LARA who cries -- begs

( )

LARA
-- please -- Jor-El-- there has to
be something-- something else we

can do--

(she stops him)
He’s our SON

(and she cries)
-- our baby

Jor-El looks at her his heart faring no better But if
he’s not strong in this moment there’s no hope He
embraces her Then quietly urgently

JOR-EL
My love We have no time You
know that

He looks into her red wet eyes giving her as much time
as he can which is none She looks at him defeated
She nods hating this moment He kisses her forehead and
they head off --

INT LAUNCH CHAMBER —- DAY

With a shockingly LOUD HISS a PORTAL opens -- we’re
looking inside a TRANSPORT POD TIGHT ON an eleven month-
old INFANT as he is placed on the cushioned interior

This child -- the baby KAL-EL who will one day become
Superman -- looks up hopefully at the parents who are
about to send him light years away The child
oblivious smiles at his parents a still teary-eyed Lara
has just reluctantly placed her son into the carrier

And they look down at their son for a last heartrending
moment Jor-El touches the baby -- and we see just how
devastating this is for him But he stays strong

JOR-EL
Look at us now Kal-El so that
one day you might remember us

Then a distant THUNDERING -- the enemy is coming

We see now that we’re in a large round high-ceilinged
space Jor-El uses a holographic keyboard and the
capsule’s portal CLOSES We can still see the infant
inside through a window as the capsule begins to FILL
WITH A CLEAR THICK LIQUID

Lara chokes back tears as the oxygenated protective GEL
covers her son And with an ear-shattering BLAST the
POD BEGINS TO RISE

( )

Jor-El and Lara watch the ascending craft which we see
silhouetted as the ceiling PARTS revealing the
Kryptonian sky --

INT KANDOR PALACE —- GREAT HALL —- DAY

Jor-El and Lara hurry through the Great Hall to

EXT KANDOR PALACE GREAT HALL ENTRANCE —- DAY

The city under siege the palace’s launch tower portal
opens and the POD containing Kal-El rises It hovers for
a moment in the path of an oncoming BUZZARD which BANKS
to avoid the pod SLAMMING into a TOWER and wobbling
wildly EXPLODING in the city streets --

Jor-El and Lara run out looking back to see the POD
BLAST INTO SPACE taking their son with it Jor-El turns
to her enemy craft ROARING through the skies above them

JOR-EL
-- go to Taga -- he’1ll provide you
passage to Djomein--

LARA
-- you aren’t coming --

JOR-EL
I can’t go now But you must
(holds her face)
I will see you again

Lara cries as she smiles He kisses her passionately A
nearby EXPLOSION ROCKS the ground -- one final look
between them -- both putting on the bravest face Lara
fighting tears hurries off Jor-El watches her go --

EXT KANDOR PALACE GARDEN STEPS —- DAY

Others run past as twenty Jor-El SOLDIERS FIRE AT THE TWO
BUZZARDS THAT PASS OVERHEAD CRACKING THROUGH THE SKY
These voice-thrashed men yell out alerting the others of
additional incoming -- desperate for more ammo Though
it’s another planet another species this is warfare at
its most familiar Its most brutal

But slowly these soldiers STOP FIRING -- PUSH IN on them
as they react to SOMETHING TERRIFYING a MASSIVE CITY-
SIZED TROOP TRANSPORT IN THE DISTANCE -- so huge that

it’s almost grey we can barely make out its details
through the atmosphere But we can see SHIPS and TROOPS
being deployed from it

( )

BOOM DOWN AND MOVE TO FIND JOR-EL brandishing a large
shoulder-strapped WEAPON He turns to his troops and
calls out forcefully

JOR-EL
WE WILL NOT HAND OVER OUR CITY
ENEMY SOLDIERS APPROACH THE SOUTH
ENTRY LET’S SHOW THEM HOW
WELCOME THEY ARE

And though the situation is grim these loyal men CHEER
their leader falling out headed for battle

EXT KANDOR PALACE GARDEN —- DAY

Jor-El vigorously leads his men FIRING at approaching
ENEMY TROOPS VARIOUS SHOTS of Jor-El’s heroism and
displays of the unflagging spirit of his men

Then suddenly a large SCULPTURE is PULVERIZED by a mega-
PULSE BLAST exploding architecture and soldiers alike
Jor-El turns to look as a GIANT MECHANICAL FOOT CRASHES

to the floor in a grim gut-pounding THUD -- this is the
ROUSER the six-story mega-mechwarrior having just
landed It FIRES AGAIN AND AGAIN destroying killing

everything it hits

Jor-El stands the last living of his men Even though
masked ENEMY TROOPS appear charging for him Jor-El
doesn’t give up he grabs a nearby BLASTAFF as half a
dozen enemy Soldiers surround him Jor-El fights them --
hand-to-hand combat one man against six What’s
incredible is how PHYSICALLY POWERFUL he is -- a BRUTAL
WARRIOR who is in the middle of PUMMELLING HIS OPPONENTS
when suddenly TWO DOZEN METALLIC SNAKE-LIKE COILS APPEAR
OUT OF NOWHERE AND GRAB HIM -- YANK HIM FORWARD HOLDING
HIM ON THE GROUND This is called a SNARE -- and it
comes from the Rouser that stands above him

TIGHT ON JOR-EL’S racked face He turns his head One
figure emerges through the dust and smoldering landscape
This is Jor-El’s brother KATA-ZOR Like his son
weve already seen his eyes are dark his skin ghostly
He walks directly up to Jor-El Looks down upon him
victorious but also somehow heartsick

KATA-ZOR
»» I can still hear your voices
in my head You and father
Returning from worship singing
the songs of Menna
(smiles mad tears in
his eyes)

(MORE )
( )
KATA-ZOR (CONTD)
He always had plans for you
didn’t he

(beat laughs)
Can you imagine what he would say
now Seeing me standing like
this over you

JOR-EL
Father would know as I do
that you won’t be standing for

long
Kata-Zor KICKS JOR-EL IN THE FACE A bloody result

KATA-ZOR
Your religion’s over Jor-El Bid
your “Holy Land” farewell
(smiles kneels)
The ashes of Menna will soon

darken the sky

TIGHT ON JOR-EL as he becomes terrified of what this
means Just then Kata-Zor GRABS JOR-EL’S FACE hard

KATA-ZOR (CONT’D)
I know you’ve sent the boy off-
planet But I will find him

And Kata-Zor KICKS JOR-EL in the face again knocking him
unconscious

KATA-ZOR’S LIEUTENANT
Sir the pod could be headed for
any one of a thousand planets

KATA-ZOR
(quiet rage)
then send a thousand men

EXT KRYPTONIAN FIELD —- DAY

-- the area we saw earlier now POST-BATTLE No living
thing to be found Then a RUMBLING A ROUSER ROARS

OVERHEAD -- flies to the center of a burnt-out field It
begins FIRING INTO THE GROUND -- BLASTING AGAIN AND AGAIN
as a CRATER forms hundreds of feet deep -- then

thousands Soon there’s a hole over a mile deep

A PORTAL then opens beneath it and a giant metallic
threatening-looking SPIKE is lowered into the hole This
oddly sexual imagery is about to have a profound impact
on this planet as the Rouser speeds away the SPIKE BOMB
SEALS ITSELF around the crater

( )

PUSH IN ON the BOMB as it makes PRE-DETONATION SOUNDS --
A SPECIFIC BEEP-CLICKING THE INCREASES LOUDER AND FASTER
AS WE PUSH IN UNTIL IT’S COMPLETELY SILENT Then
BOOOOOOOOO0OM

EXT KRYPTON - DAY - SPACE

A SHOT SO LONG THAT YOU CAN SEE THE CURVATURE OF THE
PLANET -- THE EXPLOSION SO MASSIVE IT CAN BE SEEN FROM
THIS DISTANCE A CHUNK OF THE PLANET -- MENNA --
PULVERIZED BY THE DEEP CORE DETONATION

Suddenly Krypton has a bite taken out of it like a
planetary apple massive sections of LAND and MOLTEN rock
erupt miles into space

And then from a FOREGROUND CONTINENT the PODS come
Hundreds of them lifting off from Krypton and dispersing
into space All headed away from their RED SUN hunting
down an innocent child who couldn’t possibly know of
the journey that lies ahead EPIC MUSIC SWELLS -- and
then in the most incongruous CUT of all time

INT KENT’S KITCHEN — DAY

Silence as MARTHA and JONATHAN KENT eat breakfast Late
thirties A handsome couple A good couple Their
farmhouse modest and cozy The large window beside the
table frames a view of their expansive wheat field A
timeless place HOLD ON this one shot So simple so
mundane These are their last moments of a normal life

JONATHAN
Good eggs

MARTHA
Oh good I’m glad you like ‘em
I used that new cheese
(beat)
You know with that orange label

JONATHAN
Mm Thank you
MARTHA
You’re welcome
What they don’t see is that through the window -- across
the farm -- SOMETHING THE SIZE OF AN SUV FALLS FROM THE
SKY -- SKIMMING ALONG THEIR FIELD RIGHT FOR THE HOUSE --

( )

MARTHA (CONT’D)
So Devaney called He wants to
come by for the check -- as if he
can’t wait one day to--

KA-BAM THE THING STRIKES EARTH SHATTERS THEIR FENCE --
Martha SCREAMS -- Jonathan TURNS as the POD SCREAMS FOR
THEM PLOWING UP DIRT -- Jonathan DIVES FOR MARTHA --
HITTING THE GROUND WITH HER AS DIRT FILLS THE WINDOW --
which when the action’s over JUST BARELY SPIDERS

Jonathan and Martha finally sit up mortified

EXT KENT FARM —- DAY

The Kents nervously approach the pod Smoke rises Dirt
everywhere
MARTHA JONATHAN
- careful--
-- I am I am

She stands back When Jonathan gets to the edge of this
new burnt-out ditch what he sees bewilders him

JONATHAN
-» oh my God

Jonathan jumps down into the ditch Martha watching And
now we see it KAL-EL’S POD half-buried in the earth

MARTHA
-- Sweetheart
JONATHAN MARTHA
Honey stand back--
-- I am I am

Jonathan slowly approaches the pod Jonathan reaches

out slowly cautiously and just as he touches the
pod its OUTER SHELL SUDDENLY LOUDLY RETRACTS -- THE
KENTS SCREAM -- Jonathan falls back --

It’s opened -- the LIQUID SPILLING OUT onto the dirt
revealing the ELEVEN-MONTH-OLD KAL-EL

Jonathan’s in shock And Martha can’t help it she just
starts to cry She moves past her husband for the baby
her untapped maternal instinct surfacing full-force

JONATHAN
-- Martha--

( )

-- but she carefully lifts the wet beautiful boy into
her arms Holds him close Lovingly Jonathan moves
behind her both looking into the eyes of this incredible
child Pure awe Then he SNEEZES Through her teary
eyes Martha smiles and says softly

MARTHA
- bless you
(beat meaningfully)
--- bless you

And on their astonishment we PULL BACK a couple
instantly transformed into a family

INT KENT’S LIVING ROOM - LATER —- DAY

The CAMERA ON THE FLOOR as a RUBBER BALL rolls past A
moment later little Kal-El now wearing a diaper takes
careful steps toward the ball

Martha and Jonathan watch him They’re smitten but it’s
still all very new And so damn weird

Kal-El accidentally kicks the ball it rolls under one
end of their sofa The Kents watch as the adorable
little boy waddles over to the couch carefully bends
down to pick it up and with one hand FLIPS THE SOFA
INTO THE AIR -- THE HUGE PIECE OF FURNITURE THROWN --

EXT KENT’S HOUSE —- DAY

KRRRRASH THE SOFA EXPLODES THROUGH THEIR FRONT DOOR
FRAME PAST THEIR PORCH AND LANDS IN THETR FRONT YARD

INT KENT’S LIVING ROOM —- DAY

The Kents are stunned Kal-El has his ball He’s happy
A beat on Jonathan

JONATHAN
Honey we should probably talk
about th--

MARTHA
Listen to me this child is alone
He has no family -- he obviously
didn’t come from anywhere near
here--

( )

JONATHAN
- I’m just saying our sofa’s on
the front lawn--

MARTHA
Yes he might have certain
attributes that other children
don’t --

JONATHAN
-- that’s one way to put it--

MARTHA
-- why or how that is we may never
know But look at him
(beat emotional)
Jonathan look at this beautiful

boy he’s everything

JONATHAN
He certainly is strong

MARTHA
Then we teach him restraint To
control himself -- as parents
that’s something we’d need to do
anyway--

JONATHAN

While that’s trueHoney
normally our lives wouldn’t be at

risk--

MARTHA
This boy is an angel Look at
that face That smile he looks

like an old-time movie star
(staring at him)
Are you our little Clark Gable
Our strong little Clark Gab--
(to Jonathan)
-- hey d’you like that “Clark”

Jonathan looks at his wife There’s no way he’s winning
this argument He heads out

JONATHAN
I’m gonna go outside Check on
our living room furniture
(as he goes)
You stay here with “Clark”

( )

And as he walks out strong little Clark smiles at his
mother And our SCORE BEGINS as we

DISSOLVE TO

EXT KENT FARM —- DUSK

WIDE SHOT of the farm almost three years later Of
course the pod damage has long ago been repaired From
this distance we HEAR a child laughing and

MARTHA (0S)
(like a playful
monster )
I’m gonna getcha I’m gettin’
closer

And now we’re CLOSE on the edge of the wheat field as
THREE YEAR OLD CLARK a beaming gorgeous boy runs from
the crops laughing Martha chases him playfully

At the barn Jonathan steps out having just fixed his
tractor He wipes his hands with a rag watching his
wife and young son And he can’t help but smile Then
he runs toward Clark playfully ROARING as if another
monster were now chasing him

Clark squeals laughs and runs into the house Martha
and Jonathan follow --

INT KENT’S LIVING ROOM —- DAY

As Clark runs around the coffee table escaping his
“monsters” Martha and Jonathan enter -- Jonathan moves
to him feigning a scary monster

JONATHAN
You can’t get away from the tickle
monster CAN y--

Suddenly CLARK TAKES OFF -- FLYING THROUGH THE CEILING
For a beat Jonathan and Martha are frozen stunned

JONATHAN (CONT ’D)
- well that’s new

Martha bolts up the stairs

INT JONATHAN AND MARTHA KENTS’ BEDROOM —- NIGHT

Clark is there his head happily sticking through the
shattered floorboards The Kents arrive

MARTHA
Clark whatever that was that is
not okay--
They move toward him and he RISES QUICKLY -- Martha
blurts a scream as Clark now HOVERS loving it
CLARK
Look Can you do this
But Jonathan moves to him -- takes him sets him down
JONATHAN

No Clark no one can People
don’t-- I can’t believe I’m saying
this-- Clark People don’t fly
You understand

CLARK
(so vulnerable)
- they don’t

JONATHAN
No

Martha concerned kneels saying sweetly

MARTHA
Sweetheart there’s no flying in
this house
(off his sweet nod)
Bath time Go get undressed

CLARK
-- but it’s not even dark yet--

MARTHA
Bath time

CLARK
Okay

Clark heads off to his room Jonathan looks down at the
hole in his bedroom floor He sighs But Martha’s mind
is elsewhere She says sotto

MARTHA
it’s gonna be hard

( )

Of course she KNOWS this she just feels it so much
right now

MARTHA (CONT’D)
Teaching him to act “normal”
(then the point)
Keeping him safe-- can you
imagine If anyone finds out what
he can do They’1ll take him away
they’11--

Jonathan just embraces her And whispers

JONATHAN
We’re gonna be okay The three of
us well figure it out We’re a
family

Jonathan’s love for Clark warms her

DISSOLVE TO

INT CLARKS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Later Bedtime PUSH IN as Martha reads a book to
Clark who without even knowing it gently touches her
hand It’s subtle but Martha notices this and
continues to read

DISSOLVE TO

EXT FARMLAND - DAY

The WIDEST CRANE SHOT EVER The Smallville Elementary
School bus drives along kicking up dust It stops ata
crossroads

The doors open The Kids much LOUDER now Clark EIGHT
YEARS OLD NOW gets off the bus Clearly not one of the
popular kids he wears GLASSES and is even more the
“class outsider” than he was the last time we saw him
As he gets off he says to the Driver kindly

CLARK
Thanks Miss McGrath

MISS MCGRATH

(sympathetic)
See you tomorrow Clark

( )

The doors close and the bus drives off Clark walks
home BUT HE CAN STILL HEAR THE KIDS LAUGHING INSIDE THE

BUS AS IT DRIVES AWAY A QUARTER MILE DOWN THE ROAD

KIDS
(over-lapped ab lib)
-- haha Clark was sitting next
to you Shut-up Did you see him
at recess What a freak I think
he’s learning-disabled Whatever
he’s a FREAK Total freak

Clark by now used to this covers his ears as he walks
And we’re TIGHT ON HIM as we PRE-LAP

CLARK (VO)
I never get picked For sports

EXT KENT FARM HILL - DAY

Jonathan planting a sapling looks up at Clark who sits
on the ground near him quietly angry

CLARK
The other kids think I can’t play

JONATHAN
(beat considers)
Well that’s crazy

CLARK
(firm)
No it’s not They’re right -- I
can’t throw Or hit Or jump or
kick-- not for real Not in front
of anyone So it always ends up
looking like I can’t do ANYTHING

Jonathan looks at his son who is deeply frustrated

JONATHAN
I know it doesn’t feel like it
But your secret the things

youre able to do It’s a gift--
CLARK

No Dad you always say that

But a gift is something you WANT

Jonathan stares at his son Touched at the profundity of
his words Clark is angry here -- almost tearful

( )

CLARK (CONTD)
I’m SICK of being afraid that
someone might see me do something
and realize I’m different Dad
they already THINK I’m different

JONATHAN
It’s for your own good--

CLARK
How They think I’m a weirdo
They make fun of me All the
time And it’s not fair YOU and
Mom didn’t have this problem How
come I do

Jonathan weighs the fact that Clark still doesn’t know
he’s not their biological child But he’s ill-prepared
to address this right now And we PRE-LAP

JONATHAN (VO)
-- nice Good one let’s see
another

EXT KENT FARM —- DAY

Near the house Clark faces Jonathan fifteen feet away
He’s now hitting a ball tossed to him by his father
Clark swings and hits A decent double Jonathan has
another ball ready

JONATHAN
Excellent See that You’re
doing great -- you can hit Let’s

try again Nice and gentle

Jonathan tosses the ball back to the kid Clark hits
again -- pops it up Potential homer

JONATHAN (CONT’D)
Come on Good control
(beat then twinkle
in his eye)
Hey just for fun Give ita
little juice Some of that “Kent
magic”

Clark looks at his father unsettled are you sure

JONATHAN (CONT ’D)
Come on it’s just you and me

But then almost as a warning

( )

CLARK
‘kay

And Jonathan pitches softly AND CLARK HITS THE BALL OUT
OF THE STATE Jonathan just watches it go amazed

JONATHAN
- Ooh well look at that

EXT HUB CITY - DAY

A LOUD busy multi-lane highway a city (think Detroit)
in the distance Out of nowhere a baseball lands -- SIX
CARS AND TWO TRUCKS SUDDENLY SCREECH LIKE MAD to avoid an
ugly crash One of the cars is a BORING COMPACT CAR

INT COMPACT CAR — DAY

The driver SWERVES scared in the moment -- the driver
happens to be a forty-ish man with thick glasses a bas
couture poorly-fitting suit and tie and a FULL HEAD OF
HAIR His name LEX LUTHOR

LUTHOR
-- SHIT

And he angrily checks his rearview as we PRE-LAP

LUTHOR (VO) (CONTD)
The world is doomed

INT ROOM —- DAY

TIGHT ON LUTHOR standing making an intense
PRESENTATION He speaks with a passion that some might
describe as chilling (others comedic)

LUTHOR
That is if humanity continues
feeblemindedly along its current
path Our disparate religions --
cultures politics class race
technology -- will result in
nothing but ruination The
obliteration of all things
Unless we take measures Severe
measures RADICAL measures The
ANSWER is a single central
controlling government I propose
we reshape this godforsaken planet
once and for all

( )

On that yelled notion we CUT TO Luthor’s POV he’s
talking to a class of Hub City THIRD GRADERS They’re
watching him a touch nervously This is a classroom
SCRIBBLINGS of a twisted mind on the blackboard behind
him This is when Luthor notices at the door an
elderly NUN (SISTER MARY) at the window She angrily
beckons Luthor

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
Luthor comes out to see Sister Mary who talks quietly

SISTER MARY
Mr Luthor this isn’t working

LUTHOR
-- what isn’t working

SISTER MARY
We never realized your ideas were
this extreme Or that the
children were going to be as
frightened as they are--

LUTHOR
Am I getting fired By a NUN
SISTER MARY
I’m sure you’1l find your place in
the world Mr Luthor It’s just
not at St Francis

Luthor’s rage builds -- there’s a CLAP OF THUNDER and

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

Pouring RAIN The only car that passes is Luthor’s

INT COMPACT CAR - NIGHT

Luthor drives grim Then he notices something --
something in the sky -- his horror grows -- and suddenly
Luthor SWERVES the car as a BLAZING YELLOW-RED COMET
STREAKS OVER HEAD WITH A STARTLING HOWL -- LUTHOR SWERVES
again --

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

Luthor SLAMS on the brakes as the comet IMPACTS just over
a small hill

INT COMPACT CAR - NIGHT

Luthor breathes heavily His glasses have come off now
broken He recovers for a beat then hurriedly gets out
of his car --

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

-- squinting in the rain Luthor fleets across the
desolate street over the hill Luthor scurries up the
mound of dirt horrified at what he finds buried twenty
feet deep in fiery earth is another small truck-sized
POD ONE OF HUNDREDS KATA-ZOR SENT IN THE HUNT FOR KAL-
EL Badly damaged the thing is cracked in areas the
cockpit shattered Chunks of PHOSPHOROUS GREEN ROCK
surrounds it

Luthor cautiously climbs down to the pod ONE OF KATA-
ZORS SOLDIERS SITS IN THE COCKPIT dying -- gasping
VEINS can be seen through his BLISTERING SKIN
Terrified Luthor can’t help himself he moves closer

LUTHOR
- wh what are--
SUDDENLY THE SOLDIER GRABS LUTHOR’S NECK -- Luthor

SCREAMS scrambles tries to get the hell out of here --
but the grip is too strong And Lex suddenly stops
resisting -- and his face begins to CHANGE It’s subtle
all in the man’s expression -- but as Luthor’s eyes meet
the Kryptonian’s -- his fear gradually replaced with a
fierce curiosity Then a deeper knowledge

It’s a transcendent moment as if he’s being spoken to
silently Luthor looks at the pod’s impossibly complex
CONTROL PANEL -- QUICK INTERCUTS between LUTHOR’S
ABSORBING EYES and the CONTROL PANEL’S INSTRUMENTS

Lex is so caught up in the moment that he doesn’t even
realize that HIS HAIR HAS BEGUN TO FALL OUT the RAIN

WASHING IT AWAY in clumps And finally the Kryptonian
DIES his grip loosens And Luthor now ENLIGHTENED

inexplicably mutters

LUTHOR (CONT’D)
-- KAL-EL HERE

And LIGHTNING and THUNDER strike as we BOOM UP away from
this sublime bizarre moment and we HEAR

( )

MARTHA (VO)
(quietly)
So Clark made a discovery today

INT KENT’S BEDROOM —- NIGHT

OVERHEAD SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD Martha and Jonathan who
lie awake reading

JONATHAN
- yeah What’s that

MARTHA
He can see through things

Jonathan lowers his new tractor manual Incredulous

MARTHA (CONT’D)
We were at the supermarket
Loretta Lang was there Clark
said “Mom how come that lady
isn’t wearing underwear” which
we all know is true about Loretta--

JONATHAN
-- you’re kidding me
(long beat)
- that lucky kid--

Martha hits him playfully -- he smiles and kisses her
The kiss grows more passionate until very quietly

MARTHA
(not tonight”)
-- he can hear us
JONATHAN
(barely a whisper)
Not if we’re extra quiet
A beat Then to prove her point whispers quieter

MARTHA
Clark

Then from way down the hall

CLARK (0S)
Yeah

Jonathan can’t believe this

( )

MARTHA
Go to sleep

CLARK (0S)
‘Kay

Martha smiles goes back to her book OFF Jonathan

INT METROPOLIS NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM —- DAY

CRANE DOWN from a STARFIELD to REVEAL the space exhibit
Clark (still eight years old) walks through the exhibit
with his mother who holds a CAMERA taking PICTURES

MARTHA
So Dad and I were thinking If
your eyes are bothering you you
know you have that thing with
lead We could have special
glasses made up With some lead
specks in the glass

But Clark’s eyes are elsewhere now across the museum
space LANA LANG -- seven-years-old and adorable --
stands at a SPACE ROCK display Martha turns sees

MARTHA (CONT’D)
Oh Why don’t you go say hi

CLARK
(turns away)
Nah Lana doesn’t know me

MARTHA
There are only eight kids in your
class Clark She knows you Go
say hi it’s the nice thing to do

A beat Clark sighs Gathers himself and moves to Lana
He stands there beside her Both kids just staring at
the rocks She looks at him then looks away

CLARK
Hi Lana
(a horrible silence)
Whatcha doin’ Just looking at
rocks

Then Lana looks at him Not necessarily approvingly

LANA
You stare at the wall a lot In
class

( )

CLARK
(beat self-
conscious)
- yeah I just I like looking
at the clouds and stuff

LANA
(calmly)
But it’s just a wall There
aren’t even windows

CLARK
(beat smiles as if
sharing a secret)
I make my own windows

She just looks at him

LANA
Youre the weirdest kid in class

This breaks his heart He forces a weak smile

MR LANG (0S)
Lana come on We’re leaving

And Lana just walks away Clark’s left alone for a beat
Then he heads off in the opposite direction back toward
his mother Suddenly gets a SHARP PAIN and Clark
collapses Martha runs to him alarmed --

MARTHA
Clark-- what is it are you okay

She GASPS -- her son in deep pain is developing VEINS
on his skin -- SORES Horrified she quickly gathers her
son and carries him out of the museum -- and we HOLD ON
THE LARGE GLASS CASE Clark had fallen in front of IT’S A
REFRIGERATOR-SIZED SHARP-SPIKED PHOSPHOROUS-GREEN
METEORITE We’re looking up at it and the SKYLIGHT
above it PRELAP

MARTHA (VO) (CONTD)
Sweetheart you’re sure you’re all
right
EXT KENT FARM - NIGHT
Their car has just pulled up Martha and Clark get out
CLARK

Mom I’m fine--

( )

MARTHA
Don’t “Mom” me young man if a
weird green rock makes you sick I
want to know about it--

MR DEVANEY (0S)
Well there you are

Martha jumps seeing MR DEVANEY walk out from inside
their house He’s the Kent’s landlord Big guy in his
early 50s Short cropped red hair Brown suit Martha
tries to hide her distaste for the man

MARTHA
Mr Devaney

MR DEVANEY
I let myself in hope that’s okay

No it isn’t On the porch Martha moves Clark past
Devaney toward the front door

MARTHA
If you’re looking for Jonathan
he’s not home--

MR DEVANEY
-- no I know that he told me he
was going out of town for a few
days

MARTHA
(to Clark quietly
urgent)
Get in the house

Clark goes inside Martha turns back to face Devaney
From inside the house Clark watches through a window
his tormented eyes locked on Devaney --

MR DEVANEY
I wanted to ask you if he got that

loan

MARTHA
Yes Rent will be on time this
month

MR DEVANEY
Hey you’re kidding hell froze
over No one told me

( )

Amused at himself Mr Devaney has walked close to Martha
-- putting his hand on the doorframe between her and her
front door Clark watches nervously through the glass

MR DEVANEY (CONT’D)
I have an idea you wanna hear it

MARTHA
I need to put my son to bed--
MR DEVANEY MARTHA
The boy can do that himself- -- Mr Devaney--

- we could do each other a
favor we could say this

month’s “rent free” how’s (forceful)
that -- I’d rather pay double

MR DEVANEY
(grabs her arm)
-- I see how you look at me --

Clark’s scared --

MARTHA
Let go of my arm--

-- but Mr Devaney kisses her -- she tries to push him

away -- his lips go to her neck -- his hands on her --
she tries to move him away but he’s being aggressive --
the front door opens -- Clark grabs at Mr Devaney’s
jacket
CLARK
Stop it

But Devaney just pushes the boy back

MR DEVANEY
Get back in the house

He continues his aggression on Martha who tries in vain
to fight him off Clark then lunges at Mr Devaney --
tackling him OFF THE PORCH --

MARTHA
Clark

Clark then GRABS MR DEVANEY AND THROWS HIM TWENTY YARDS
ACROSS THEIR PROPERTY Devaney lands hard SKIDDING BACK
in the dirt toward the barn Martha’s horrified as
Devaney comes to a stop dirty and bleeding He looks
over at Clark -- held back now by Martha The boy is
more afraid than anything else Mr Devaney is a mess
his eyes wide terrified

( )

MR DEVANEY
ee you you’re Satan
Martha holds Clark whose back is against her legs --

MARTHA
-- get in the house--

But Clark is fixed on Devaney who yells words that will
stay with Clark -- in a way define Clark -- for years

MR DEVANEY
YOUR BOY’S THE DEVIL THE DEVIL
HIMSELF

Devaney stumbles to his car parked in darkness near the
barn -- it DRIVES AWAY a cloud of dust behind it

And Martha kneels to her son Looks at him then
embraces him

MARTHA
Don’t you listen to that man
(then)
» you have love in your heart
you’re my hero

But we’re CLOSE ON CLARK as Devaney YELLS about Clark
MUFFLED in the background to no one in particular

FADE OUT

FADE IN

INT KENT’S HOUSE —- DAY

A view looking down the stairs of the house toward the
entry way And we HEAR

CLARK (0S)
Mom Dad

And CLARK enters -- now TWELVE YEARS OLD He moves
halfway up the stairs toward camera looking past us

CLARK (CONT’D)
Mom or Dad

But no one’s home Happy about this Clark runs off --

INT KENT FARM BARN —- DAY

We find Clark at the top of a ladder at the hay loft
He’s moving aside hay revealing CHRISTMAS PRESENTS that
his parents have hidden here He picks up a wrapped box -
- shakes it -- but unlike most kids Clark doesn’t have

to unwrap anything to see what’s inside he just removes
his glasses and LOOKS THROUGH THE WRAPPING

We SEE his X-RAY VISION seeing through LAYERS -- PAPER
BOX then finally he sees a NOTE inside which READS
“CLARK NO PEEKING” Frustrated by this he tosses

that present aside and goes looking at the others --
revealing a pair of SNEAKERS Another’s a MICROSCOPE
Then a SWEATER Then one of the presents FALLS --
landing on the hay-covered barn floor with a HOLLOW THUD
CLOSE ON CLARK who reacts to the odd sound

Moments later Clark has climbed down and moves away hay
on the ground revealing a large metallic RING -- a
handle for the ROOT CELLAR door Something we can see
in Clark’s face that he has never seen

INT KENT FARM - ROOT CELLAR - DAY

Darkness Then the CEILING OPENS Clark opens the door
to the cellar shaft of light cuts down Clark walks
down the creaky wooden stairs Clark finds a hanging
string He pulls it a dim yellow BULB lights the space

And something is there covered by a thick TARP Clark
moves to it and pulls the tarp away REVEALING THE POD
THAT HE LANDED IN YEARS AGO Clark stares at it
amazed The silver sheen the “S” engraved in its angled

nose He reaches out gingerly touches the “S” -- when
SUDDENLY STARTLINGLY -- A COMPARTMENT ON THE POD OPENS --
Clark jumps back -- then moves forward -- AND SEES THE

SUPERMAN SUIT FOLDED AND PLACED SECURELY IN THE
COMPARTMENT The BLUE RED and YELLOW “S” REVEALED TO
HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME On Clark’s face his mind
racing

EXT KENT FARM BARN - DAY

The SIDE DOOR SWINGS OPEN and Clark steps out standing
akimbo WEARING THE SUPERMAN SUIT Of course it’s WAY
too big Behind those glasses Clark’s eyes are
melodramatically fixed on the horizon Cocky he moves
forward -- AND TRIPS ON THE CAPE FALLING ON HIS ASS

( )

He looks up his glasses askew So he removes them And
when he stands he has an idea

EXT FIELD —- DAY

Inspired by the suit Clark runs around his parents’
property watching the glorious red cape dance in the
wind behind him He’s having a blast

And as he runs around the farm he LEAPS over his father’s
tractor checking the cape in mid air -- Clark lands and
he keeps running -- as he runs he approaches the BARN --
he strains and LEAPS AGAIN -- into the sky -- but instead
of coming down again he SWOOPS DOWN -- FLYING FOR A
MOMENT -- this freaks him out and he lands hard --

He sits up -- shocked -- realizing that he might have an
ability hitherto unknown

So he’s on his feet again -- running faster and faster
He JUMPS AGAIN and he FLIES uncertainly like a kid
riding a two-wheeled bike for the first time As scared
as he is he LAUGHS -- finds that the best position for
his arms isn’t perpendicular to his body but STRAIGHT
AHEAD Now he SOARS into the sky -- five-thousand feet
above the Earth -- AND HE LOSES CONFIDENCE AND FALLS --
and as he falls he SCREAMS -- then FORCES HIMSELF TO
REGAIN CONTROL -- and just before he hits the ground he
FLIES AGAIN -- SWOOPING into the WHEAT FIELDS burrowing
through the fields like an adolescent airborne MOLE

He flies through stacks of HAY BAILS again and again --
not realizing that parked behind the last stack is
Jonathan Kent’s TRACTOR

The impact is intense the tractor practically EXPLODES
into a thousand pieces as Clark wipes out hard --

Out of breath and stunned by the impact he stands --
only to find his PARENTS standing next to their car
having just arrived home He’s in trouble

CLARK
eee hi

JONATHAN
Go to your room
INT CLARKS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Clark sits on his bed in normal clothes again His
glasses broken

( )

Though guilty he talks excitedly to his parents who sit
before him filled with dread they’re about to have the
difficult conversation they’ve known was coming for
years

CLARK
I was just having fun I didn’t
know I’d fly I had no idea I
could fly--

JONATHAN
-- Clark --

CLARK
I knew I could jump but not fly
and then I was trying to figure
out was it the cape The suit
Or was it just me It can’t be
me

MARTHA
-- it’s you

JONATHAN
The same way your eyes work
differently than other kids The
same way you’re stronger When
you were little a few times

you flew
CLARK

I flew when I was little I DID
MARTHA

You know how much we love you
JONATHAN

Clark That vehicle The

thing you found in the barn

(beat)
That’s what brought you here

Clark is beyond confused It takes a long beat

CLARK
(breathless timid)
- what
MARTHA
You’re not from here From
Smallville
(heartbroken)
- Sweetheart you’re not from

this planet

( )

And Clark stares horrified Numb Looking at his
parents through teary eyes for an answer But their
looks make it clear they have no idea Clark grapples
with this mega-news -- the realization that all he’s
feared is being confirmed he is a freak A monster
Perhaps the Devil himself Clark runs off --

MARTHA (CONT’D)
-- Clark Honey

EXT KENT FARM HILL - NIGHT

Clark bolts through the Kent’s field crying -- trying to
lose himself -- wishing he weren’t himself Running so
hard for so long he finally collapses near the tree
which has grown considerably since it was planted Clark
sobs -- the deep painful cries of a true Outsider

And with the lights of the Kent home in the distance
behind him Clark looks into the sky with his wet eyes
into the infinite night knowing that somewhere up
there is a home that cast him away

After a long moment Jonathan walks up behind him

JONATHAN

You’re gonna figure this out One
day And you’re gonna understand
why you can do the things you can
Why you’re here

(then)
I’m telling you Clark you’re
gonna grow up Be the first Kent
to go to college And you’1l
figure it out

But Clark can’t believe this -- because he doesn’t
believe in himself His eyes are on the sky He’s just
lost Hopeless

CLARK
I know Dad and one day you’ll
be proud of me

JONATHAN

Son I’m already proud

Clark looks at his father Jonathan puts his arm around

his boy And they both look up at the STARS which now
FILL THE SCREEN After a beat we SLOWLY TILT DOWN and
find MULTIPLE MOONS and the TILT CONTINUES REVEALING

EXT DJOMEIN DESERT KRYPTON —- NIGHT

-- nighttime in a cracked-earth desert terrain that seems
to go on forever And amid the rocky nothingness is a
clay and straw DWELLING Whispy smoke rises from a
makeshift chimney And these WORDS APPEAR ONSCREEN
DJOMEIN DESERT KRYPTON

INT HUT -— NIGHT

LARA (fifty now) sits at a table writing in a journal
Her face weathered strong This is a woman who has
survived alone and on the run for over two decades
Then suddenly a SOUND outside -- in what seems like a
millisecond she grabs a BLASTAFF and is on her feet
The reflexes of an animal

EXT DJOMEIN DESERT KRYPTON —- NIGHT

Lara steps out Looks at the vast nighttime desert
There’s no one here So she walks through the rock
structures then SOUND -- she turns fast -- but it
was just a small rock skittering down the mountainside

It’s silent for a moment -- and we just KNOW we’re about
to get scared to death -- and that we do as suddenly A
GIANT ROUSER FOOT LANDS HARD CRUSHING HER DWELLING --
Lara screams as she shoots at the Rouser but it’s
useless as the whip-fast silvery TENTACLES PROJECT FROM
THE METAL BEAST -- THE SNARE -- AND GRAB LARA DRAGGING
HER TO THE GROUND AS THE OTHER ROUSER FOOT LANDS NEARBY
WITH A MIGHTY THUD She’s held now tight -- as a FIGURE
EMERGES from the darkness A warrior He removes his
mask

It’s TY-ZOR -- the terrifying warrior who we know will
one day confront Superman Only 21 years old here he’s

still scary -- Lara sees him her eyes wide in fear --
and just as she’s about to scream --

EXT KANDOR - NIGHT

The once-glorious city already showing signs of
disrepair The SOUNDS of THICK SECURITY DOORS CLANGING
OPEN and we CUT TO

INT KANDOR PALACE SUBLEVEL STAIRS - NIGHT

Three levels beneath Jor-El’s former palace Kata-Zor
(now 60) and Ty-Zor head down to the fourth level
Following them is an entourage including four GUARDS two
of them half-dragging Lara --

INT JOR-EL’S CELL - NIGHT

CLOSE ON JOR-EL Close enough that it’s painful to see
what’s become of Superman’s father At 59 years-old
he’s wire-chained to the wall lips chapped dried blood
scars and filth cover the former proud Kryptonian leader

He looks up as the cell door opens -- and Guards enter
followed by Kata-Zor who stares at Jor-El for a moment
taking him in It’s been a while Still the hatred is
evident

KATA-ZOR

You are resilient

(then)
I wondered if especially after
last year’s winter you would
survive down here

(then)
I’m glad you did

Jor-El looks up his eyes red sick and confused as TWO
GUARDS ENTER DRAGGING THE WIFE JOR-EL HASN’T SEEN IN TWO

DECADES Jor-El is in shock -- his voice ragged
JOR-EL
-- Lara--
LARA
-- my love--

But they quickly shove Lara to the ground holding her
head down execution style --

JOR-EL
No
Jor-El fight his restraints -- pointlessly
KATA-ZOR

My son He found her By chance
I almost didn’t believe him when
he told me
(then)
(MORE )

( )

KATA-ZOR (CONTD)
Youve never met have you My
son

Jor-El looks up breathing heavily and noticing that Ty-
Zor has also entered the cell Ty-Zor moves forward
expression grim staring at Jor-El relishing the moment

KATA-ZOR (CONT’D)
Such a handsome boy

(then)
The same age as your own hm
(then)
You haven’t told us in the past
This time however it is not

you we will torture
Jor-El’s eyes on Lara his mind spinning in horror --

KATA-ZOR (CONT’D)
All is well you should know Up
there in the real world The
empire is under my control -- as
monarch you’re all but forgotten--

LARA
You deluded fool the people HATE
you They FEAR y--

SHOVE-- the Guard pushes her head down painfully --

JOR-EL
STOP

Ty-Zor steps forward his blood boiling Seeing his
father disrespected makes him insane -- he’s a time bomb -
- a volcano about to erupt --

KATA-ZOR
(just continuing)
But still in the quiet of my
chamber I admit that I remain

unsettled Unresolved Tell me
where to find Kal-El

LARA
Never

Jor-El’s eyes flick to his defiant wife

JOR-EL
-- Lara he will k--

( )

LARA JOR-EL
-- NO We can’t -- Kal-El is strong he--
-- and you must be strong
aswell -- I cannot let th--

-- we can’t give up now
were so close NOTA
WORD -- Lara--

KATA-ZOR
(to Jor-El softly)
No my brother you’re wise to

cooperate -- tell me where to find
your son

JOR-EL
-- you question why father always
chose me--

KATA-ZOR

Tell me where he is you know I
will show no mercy to your woman--

JOR-EL
-- because he could see the nature
of your heart

KATA-ZOR
TELL ME WHERE HE IS

And they explode in equal rage

JOR-EL KATA-ZOR
He wanted to protect the Do not think that I will
people of Krypton you hesitate This is your one
fool He was afraid of-- chance to save her if--

Their fury is interrupted as Ty-Zor suddenly GRABS KATA-
ZORS BLADE PULLS IT FROM ITS SHEATH AND IN ONE
TERRIFYING MOVE STRIKES DOWN UPON LARA’S HEAD

Silence Stunned silence Even Kata-Zor is chilled as
Ty-Zor breathing heavily -- his brutal nature revealed
to the world -- DROPS the sword turns and leaves the
cell Jor-El is devastated -- and for the first time
ever Kata-Zor is fearful of his own son

INT CLARK’S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
Clark suddenly sits up into frame on his bed
breathless and unnerved He’s a COLLEGE SENIOR now

Behind him the door opens and his big roommate JERRY
SHUSTER enters

( )

JERRY
-- so Clark I’m gonna go get
Susan Ill be at the party in ten
-- when we get there I wanna see
you inside with a potent
beverage hanging from something
and acting like a monkey

CLARK
-- I feel sick--

As Jerry roughly but kindly unbuttons Clark’s collar

JERRY
Yeah it’s ‘cause you’re an anti-
socialite and I’m forcing you to
actually engage in a communal
activity IT’S CALLED A PARTY
CLARK

CLARK
It’s like something horrible just--

Jerry grabs a TERM PAPER from Clark’s desk

CLARK (CONT’D)
Jerry that’s a final -- I have to
turn it in tomorrow--

JERRY
I will not graduate leaving
behind a roommate who has no
social skills or direction in life
-- you want this back Get your
scared little ass to Derrek’s --
and wear something dark -- none of
your blue and red

And Jerry’s gone with Clark’s final Clark sighs

EXT FRAT HOUSE —- NIGHT

You can smell the beer as DANCE MUSIC THUMPS in our gut
Clark walks up a group of partying STUDENTS walk past
him He approaches the house nervously drapes obscure a
view into the party He stands out here for a moment
uncomfortable Too nervous to enter Finally he turns --
he’s gonna walk home Then he HEARS

FEMALE VOICE (0S)
Hey Cut it out

( )

And he turns back -- at the front of the house are two
girls -- one blonde (ABBY) whose back is to us -- the

other a BEAUTIFUL BRUNETTE GIRL arguing And Clark’s
heart stops This is LOIS LANE incoming Freshman

Clark watches as finally Lois gets convinced to re-enter
the party She disappears inside And Clark smitten
looks around -- no one looking -- then he REMOVES HIS
GLASSES AND USES HIS X-RAY VISION And we get to SEE IT
the optic nerve working like a frog’s whip-fast tongue --
INSTANT ZOOMS pushing THROUGH the walls of the house
providing a view into the party

Dancing and drinking -- lots of kids laughing having a
blast The blonde girl leaves Lois alone And she
stands there observing The outsider We will come to
learn that in many ways Lois is just as much an alien as
Clark Then the blonde returns with a big GUY They’re
heading upstairs for some fun and clearly trying to get
Lois to go with them Clark watches as she declines

The blonde takes her arm but Lois pulls away making some
excuse and heads for the back of the house So Clark
puts his glasses back on Adjusts his clothes a little
Takes a deep breath and heads off

EXT FRAT HOUSE - BACK PORCH —- NIGHT

Through the kitchen windows kids party But out here
it’s like a sanctuary Lois is alone looking out at the
night Then Clark walks up the steps A beat It takes
a bit of courage to get to

CLARK
ee great party

LOIS
(not looking at him)
It sucks

A beat Clark nods this isn’t gonna work He turns to
leave when Lois says more to herself than to him

LOIS (CONTD)
I can not believe I’m here

CLARK

(beat)
- me neither

( )

LOIS
This girl from high school-- Abby
Farmer -- she and I are gonna be

freshmen here next year she said
we needed to come tonight we
needed to “network” -- but we’re
not even friends -- the only
reason she wanted me to come was
so she wouldn’t show up alone I
predicted this would happen now
Abby’s almost unconscious
upstairs with some three-hundred-
pound former Lincoln High all-
star football dough-head and I’m
stuck out here waiting for her to
“finish” with him so that I can
drive the three hours back home
while she’s passed out riding
shotgun Great party Your fly’s
undone

CLARK
-- oh--

As he does his zipper she says frustrated

LOIS
Maybe I need to lighten up
Just try and network

(with a faux smile)
Hi what class are you in What’s
your major

This is actually a sensitive subject for Clark

CLARK
I’m uh I’m a senior And
undeclared

LOIS

(beat like it’s
disgusting)

An undeclared senior

CLARK
-- oh well that was a nice non-
judgmental reaction

LOIS
I’m sorry-- that was rude--

CLARK
I just don’t know what I want to
do yet that’s all I have

(MORE )
( )

Maybe it’s CLARK (CONTD)

some other issues I’m still
working on

LOIS
Don’t listen to me-- I’m a freak
I just wanna skip all this and get
on with it

CLARK
- with what

LOIS
With LIFE With WORK with things
that actually MATTER not this

CLARK
-- so what do you wanna do

LOIS
I wanna be the voice of people who
go through life unheard

CLARK
Wow Huh
(but then)
I don’t understand what that--

LOIS
I’m gonna graduate in three years
move to the city and start writing
for The Daily Planet I’m gonna
be a journalist That’s my plan

how she smells But Clark is in love with

her She reads his ga-ga stare as common skepticism

LOIS (CONTD)
You think I’m peculiar Overly-
optimistic oddly ambitious -- you
think it’s silly to want to help
the underdog

CLARK
(smiles quietly)
- that’s none of that was

what I was thinking

Suddenly the door opens -- it’s ABBY and the BIG GUY

ABBY
-- hey So there’s another party
in Southside let’s go

LOIS
I am not going to another party

( )

The Big Guy TAKES Lois’ arm

BIG GUY LOIS
-- Come on I’m driving-- -- I said no
-- Trust me you’ll have -- Hey
fun
CLARK

-- leave her alone
The Big Guy stops Turns to Clark PUSHES Clark

BIG GUY
Excuse me Did I even look at
you

But instead of killing the guy Clark is frozen He’s
terrified -- as the Big Guy PUSHES Clark again -- and
again -- it quickly becomes clear that Clark won’t even
defend himself

The Big Guy PUSHES AGAIN -- and just when it’s about to
get really ugly LOIS PUSHES THE BIG GUY HARD

LOIS
LEAVE HIM ALONE

The Big Guy turns to her surprised Then the Big Guy
PUSHES LOIS Before Clark can even react LOIS SLAMS THE
GUY IN THE FACE -- FOLLOWED BY A FLURRY OF POWERFUL
SUDDEN BLOWS THE BIG GUY SLAMS ONTO THE PORCH OUT
COLD Clark is absolutely STUNNED Abby is aghast

ABBY LOIS
Now how are we gonna find -- we’re not going to the
the party-- party we’re going home

ABBY
Okay you know what This is why
people don’t like you ‘Cause
youre not like normal

Abby storms off leaving Lois embarrassed and sad
Clark watches closely as Lois heads out

LOIS
Excuse me
CLARK
Wait
(Lois stops)
- what what’s your name

( )

LOIS
Lois Lane The abnormal Lois
Lane

Good luck Figuring everything

works here-- I wondered if
she--

A MASSIVE DOOR SLAM Clark turns to see on the other
side of the colossal space Lois storming out of PERRY
WHITE’S OFFICE She moves across the place and furiously
grabs her bag from her desk which backs up to Clark’s

JIMMY (CONT’D)
-- what’s the prob

Lois angrily packs up her bag of stuff emphasizing angry
words by throwing things in

LOIS

(wanna know what’s

wrong
Uh the system’s the prob The
inequity of the world’s the prob
That the average citizen is
unknowingly violated by the whims
of unprincipled billionaires

JIMMY
Mr White’s not gonna print your
story

LOIS

And you know why He got a call
from Luthor’s legion of lawyers
threatening legal action --
apparently my piece is a
“libellous misrepresentation of an
issue Luthor’s addressing at the
Lexcorp shareholders meeting this

afternoon” -- so I’m going over
there
JIMMY

-- wait what Does Perry know
Obviously not Lois SLAMS her desk drawer and heads off

CLARK
Lois hi I’m Cla--

( )

-- but Lois is gone -- at the same moment they HEAR

PERRY
-- Clark Kent

They turn as PERRY WHITE arrives -- a gruff white-
haired fast-talking bastard He shakes Clark’s hand

PERRY (CONT’D)
Perry White

CLARK PERRY
-- yessir-- -- that’s not a handshake
what the hell is that --
-- sorry sir I -- -- don’t worry about your

handshake work on your
writing it needs it

-- excuse me -- -- don’t get precious
you’re not one of those
sensitive guys are you I

-- I don’t-- hope not Don’t be It’s
your first day -- shadow
Lois she’ll show you the
ropes

Perry slaps his arm and heads off They watch him go

JIMMY
First time I met Mr White I
thought he was just a total
asshole

After a long beat Clark looks at Jimmy waiting for the
rest of the sentence Jimmy realizes

JIMMY (CONT’D)
Oh -- no that’s it

EXT METROPOLIS - DAY

Clark and Lois walk down a PEDESTRIAN-PACKED sidewalk
through our favorite city -- Clark keeps up the fast pace
with a still-angry Lois as she briskly walks

CLARK
-- so Lois-- what-- what’s the
dirt on Luthor

LOIS
Dirt’s a good word -- I heard him
speak a few months ago --
accepting a humanitarian award of
all things

(MORE )
( )

And Clark

LOIS (CONTD)

Something about him just creeped
me out You must have that
sometimes right Instincts about

people
CLARK

-- uh on occasion I--
LOIS

All the money the philanthropy
no he’s like Big Brother You
got a cell phone

CLARK
(pulls out his phone)
Yeah

LOIS
(checks the phone’s
manufacturer )
Yup he’s spying on you right now

follows her as she crosses in the middle of the

TRAFFIC-GRIDLOCKED street no crosswalk --

She walks

CLARK
-- uh I don’t-- understand

stepping past a stopped BUS turning back to

Clark to say

LOIS
All you have to know is this
Luthor’s a deceitful immoral
scheming unethical jackass

SCREEEEECH Lois has walked into an empty lane where a
large DELIVERY TRUCK moving fast SLAMS its brakes to

avoid her

-- Lois SCREAMS -- Clark reflexively PUTS OUT

HIS HAND and the truck comes to a SUDDEN STOP its REAR
TIRES almost LIFTING OFF THE STREET for a moment The
DRIVER jumps out

DRIVER
-- Lady you all right Jesus

LOIS
-- I’m fine I’m sorry we
shouldn’t be crossing here

DRIVER
I can’t believe I didn’t just kill
you--

( )

As they head off Clark says visibly shaken -- deeply
worried as if he’s just committed a crime and is afraid
of being found-out

CLARK
Excellent job Breaking Nice

Clark walks off following Lois But we stay on the
Driver who then notices the ENORMOUS DENT IN HIS TRUCK’S
GRILL -- WHERE CLARK’S HAND IMPACTED IT Off the
Driver’s confusion EARSPLITTING APPLAUSE can be HEARD
as PRE-LAP TO

INT LEXCORP BUILDING - AUDITORIUM —- DAY

A giant amphitheater Well-dressed SHAREHOLDERS applaud
the SPEAKER at the stage podium DOLLY AROUND TO REVEAL
the handsome cocksure brilliant fellow at the mic mid-
speech Wearing a dashing designer suit and still-bald
head this of course is LEX LUTHOR The “LEXCORP” icon
looms overhead

Clark and Lois find seats as the applause dies down
Luthor confidently continues Lois glaring

LUTHOR

In this quarter in this economy
weve surpassed earnings estimates
across the board

(more APPLAUSE and

Luthor smiles)
In fact we’re doing so well that
one of you kind shareholders
recently sent me this

And he holds up a “LUTHOR FOR PRESIDENT” bumper sticker
The place goes INSANE Lois wants to kill herself

LUTHOR (CONT’D)
And I DO have to say I am
getting a little bored with my
square office But an OVAL one

Even more CHEERS of support Lois is incredulous Eyes
on Luthor she says to no one in particular but Clark’s
there to hear it

LOIS
You keep thinking it can’t get
worse It just got worse he’s
gonna run for President And the
scary thing The creep could win

( )

As the CHEERS die down

LUTHOR
I’1l save my political agenda for
another time For now I have
work to do For you While I may
be good at bragging I’m also able
to admit when Lexcorp can do
better That’s why next week
were releasing a firmware update
to our Luthanium chip--

LOIS
(angry sotto)
-- unbelievable --

Clark turns to her

LUTHOR
-- which will make all Luthanium-
powered phones and computers that
much more secure--

Finally Lois can’t stand it -- she jumps to her feet

LOIS
Mr Luthor isn’t it true that you
KNEW the chip had security issues
MONTHS ago

Clark absolutely blanches -- a MURMUR quickly spreads
throughout the room Necks crane -- including those of a
creepy-looking 40ish man in a dark suit This is
Luthor’s head of security MR DUNN Seeing Lois DUNN
REACTS THIS IS SOMETHING HE DID NOT WANT TO HAPPEN

Luthor squints against the lights -- sees Lois Smiles
Apparently not threatened in the least

LOIS (CONTD)
Didn’t an employee make you aware
of this “glitch” six months before
the Luthanium chip was to be
brought to market

Clark hesitantly reaches for Lois’ sleeve to tug her
down but she yanks it back not stopping at all

LOIS (CONTD)
Isn’t it true that your intention
was to market a chip that would
allow you to spy on your
customers

( )

LUTHOR
For those of you unfamiliar allow
me to introduce conspiracy
theorist Lois Lane

LAUGHS from the room as SECURITY GUARDS head for Lois --

LOIS
What is it you’re looking for Mr
Luthor
CLARK
-- Lois come on--
Clark tries her sleeve again -- again she yanks it away
LUTHOR

At the moment I’m simply looking
for some courtesy

The Guards get to her now -- grab her -- Clark stands
puts a hand on both their wrists -- SQUEEZES -- the
Guards shrink in pain --

CLARK
(softly)
We’re on our way out thanks

Clark takes Lois and escorts her out Luthor watches her
go visibly annoyed -- CUT TO

inadvertently helped give me a
direction that night

She looks at Clark touched It’s the first time she’s
really seen him

LOIS

CLARK
Yeah And I just wanted to say--

PERRY (0S)

( )

PERRY (CONT’D)

unpleasant minutes on the phone
with Luthor’s attorneys defending
you against a slander suit

were considered good luck

(smiles)
Then Dad reminded him that his
truck had broken down

Clark watches her for a minute then brings up the
horrible thing that’s been on his mind

CLARK
It happened in the field
(beat guiltily)
- why was Dad running in
(then to confirm)
He had his radio didn’t he It
was because of me

Off her sad look Clark looks off guilty and heartsick

CLARK (CONT’D)
» I’m never doing it again
Putting on that damn suit

Martha just touches his face

MARTHA
I will not let you blame yourself
for this I just won’t have it
Your father was proud of you
(beat then)
And you should eat something

And with a sniffle she walks off Clark stares off his
heart heavy

INT KENT’S KITCHEN — DAY

Only thirty minutes have passed and the mood has shifted
as it so erratically does soon after someone’s death A
relatively lighter moment as Clark sits at the table
absentmindedly shifting the SILVER PIECES around on his
placemat Martha cooks a grilled cheese

( )

MARTHA

So you still haven’t told me what
it was like Saving that
airplane

Sliding the pieces around he’s already thinking about
Lois We can simply see it He loves her

CLARK

- it was it was unusual

(then to the point)

There was a woman On the plane
I wanted to make sure she was

okay
her

so afterwards I walked up to
You know just to check
(then)

- the way she looked at me

(beat shrugs)

No girl’s ever looked at me like

that

(beat)

It was like she saw me

MARTHA

Did you ask her out

CLARK
Mom I was wearing a cape
MARTHA
True Still -- any girl worth
your time won’t care what you’re
wearing--
CLARK

Well that’s sweet but--

MARTHA

-- or what job you have or how
much money What she’1ll care
about is who you are

Clark unsettled goes back to the pieces considering
this very issue he doesn’t really know who he is Or
who he’s supposed to be As he slides the pieces around
he suddenly stops
IN ON CLARK HIS EYES WIDE THE FIVE SILVER PIECES SET
ON THE CORNER OF THE PLACEMAT ARE THE NEGATIVE SPACE

Our SCORE A DEEP SUSTAIN as we PUSH

THAT MAKE UP THE “S” ON SUPERMAN’S SUIT Clark’s blood
now runs cold -- quietly
CLARK
-- Mom

( )

Martha sandwich on plate moves to Clark -- sees the “S”
on the table and freezes Drops the plate it SHATTERS

INT KENT’S LIVING ROOM —- DAY

A PHOTO ALBUM CRACKS OPENS -- Martha searches through it
Clark sits beside her

MARTHA
-- I remember the three of us
stayed up talking almost all night
-- he kept asking us questions he
was so curious

And there it is Martha finds a photograph of herself
with Jonathan -- AND JOR-EL who wears simple American
clothes sitting at the Kent kitchen table Clark just
stares Somehow this man is familiar

CLARK
(to himself numb)
what does this mean

Clark’s mind tumbles Martha grows overcome with emotion
and turns to Clark saying intimately guiltily

MARTHA
- Sweetheart your father and
I always said that you were here
because you were the answer to our
prayers But we both always knew
it had to be so much more than
that we just didn’t know what

Clark looks at her searchingly

MARTHA (CONT’D)
Nothing scared us more then the
idea that someone would find out
That you’d be taken away from us
That’s why we tried so hard To

make you seem “normal”
(looks at the photo)
- now I think maybe that was

a mistake

CLARK

Mom you didn’t make any mistakes--
MARTHA

-- what I’m saying is Clark

maybe “normal” was the last thing
you were supposed to be

(MORE )
( )

MARTHA (CONTD)

(then)
Maybe you’re the answer to
everyone’s prayers

Clarks eyes dart off as he considers the implications --
frightened of them

INT CLARKS BEDROOM —- DAY

A bittersweet image Clark now a full-grown man sits on
the edge of his childhood bed Holding the SUPERMAN
SUIT Staring at it in a moment of truth

We SLOWLY PUSH IN ON HIM as he considers his past His
purpose And most importantly his future As our MUSIC
BUILDS we CUT TO

EXT KENT FARM — WHEAT FIELD —- DUSK

PUSH THROUGH an ocean of wheat just above the chaffs
And as we come around what we see is a vision

Standing in the middle of this wheat field is Superman

The image is classic beautiful epic -- but the meaning
is what’s important Here he stands in the place where
he grew up Where he ran as a child lost and confused

But now he knows Superman looks out onto the crimson
horizon -- then he closes his eyes Listening
Listening to the world’s cries for help

Distant SCREAMS -- desperate PLEAS -- and we’re TIGHT ON
Superman his emotions rising it’s almost overpowering --
but when your choices are unlimited you have to make a
CHOICE GUNFIRE and SCREAMS -- then an EXPLOSION SOUND --
Superman snaps his head toward the source and TAKES OFF
wheat WHIPPED into the sky as he FLIES OFF IN A BLUR INTO
THE BRILLIANT SUNSET WHIP PAN TO

EXT BOND STREET - LONDON ENGLAND - NIGHT

AN EXPLOSION a team of professional THIEVES -- MILITARY-
CLAD masked and fearless -- have just BLOWN UP the
facade of the highest-priced JEWELRY STORE in London
People run screaming as a BLACK FORD EXCURSION makes a
LOUD SCREECHING 90-DEGREE FISHTAIL and quickly BACKS
INTO THE JEWELRY STORE --

INT JEWELRY STORE - NIGHT

The terrifying Thieves JUMP out of the back FIRING at
random -- PEOPLE inside SCREAMING DUCKING RUNNING as
the Thieves move to displays of DIAMONDS and SHATTER the
glass with ICE PICKS -- KRASH KRASH KRASH They
gather the goods as one of the Thieves yells to the
cowering people here

THIEF 1
DOWN ON THE GROUND DON’T MOVE

But one of the people here tries to make a run for it --
the Thief FIRES AT HIM just as we CUT TO

EXT BOND STREET - NIGHT

SIRENS BLARE as four POLICE CARS ARRIVE -- two of the

Thieves FIRES THEIR SUB-MACHINE GUNS taking even the
police by surprise -- they SHATTER WINDSHIELDS POCK-MARK

the cars -- one of the cars EXPLODES -- and we see in the
sky

A HELICOPTER IS ARRIVING -- at first we think it’s a
police chopper -- but we soon realize THIS IS THE
THIEVES’ GETAWAY Another Thief SHOOTS DOWN ON THE
POLICE AS WELL -- the Cops helpless run for cover as --

INT JEWELRY STORE - NIGHT

The Thieves continue to grab the goods -- Thief 2 at the
stairwell with a bag of stolen stuff
THIEF 2

WE’RE GOOD LET’S GO LET’S GO
Like a SWAT team the Thieves run out -- but the last one
pulls a pin on a GRENADE and tosses it -- the People here
run out of the building as KA-BOOOOOOOM The ground
floor EXPLODES -- the place is filled with FIRE NOW --
people TRAPPED here SCREAMING
The trapped People try to find a way out -- but the fire
surrounds them -- there’s no escape A Woman starts to

cry A Man begins to pray Others don’t give up but
they’re dead THEN

( )

A figure walks through the flames IT’S SUPERMAN He
sees the helpless people then turns to the fire and
BLOWS -- PUTTING OUT THE FIRE with a sudden remarkable
breath A Woman terrified impossibly relieved and
suddenly wildly in love says

WOMAN
- who who are you

SUPERMAN
I’m Superman

And that smile -- that confidence -- almost destroys her

EXT JEWELRY STORE BUILDING ROOF —- NIGHT

The Thieves rush into the chopper which LIFTS OFF --

INT HELICOPTER — NIGHT

Flying into the night the Thieves CHEER in wild
celebration HAHA They did it They POP champagne
drink from the bottles spraying each other -- and then
KA-CHUNK They LUNGE FORWARD as a giant KRASH SOUND is
HEARD -- AND AS THE ROTOR SOUND VANISHES Suddenly --
SILENTLY -- the chopper’s going BACKWARDS --

THIEVES

HELL IS THIS

EXT SKY -— NIGHT

SUPERMAN HOLDS THE CHOPPER -- BLADES GONE NOW -- FROM THE

EXT BOND STREET —- NIGHT

The police look up dumbstruck as Superman descends with
the chopper Instead of setting it down though he
ANGLES THE CHOPPER so the Thieves fall out the open door
and drop thirty feet to the street in a worthless pile
Holding the chopper airborne with one hand a swift wave
with the other The Police wave back amazed

Pedestrians GO NUTS -- our MUSIC SOARS and we CUT TO

Lois energetically passionately and rapidly reads her
piece aloud to Perry who sits at his desk

LOIS
“-- and forty-eight hours after
the astonishing rescue of Air

infinite number of questions
remain we are left with a new
definitive answer to a most
profound question is there hope

Lois looks to Perry nervous and hopeful waiting for his
reaction Perry just stares at her This unnerves Lois

LOIS (CONTD)
You don’t like it

Uncharacteristically sweet and simple

PERRY
Youre young Which is annoying --
youre too enthusiastic
idealistic reckless But I was
the one who assigned you that

Everyone gathers to watch the TV monitors which display
international NEWS BROADCASTS On one monitor an
ANCHORWOMAN talks about the English bank incident -- with
VIDEO from the scene as Superman burst from the bank

ANCHORWOMAN

But the so-called “Superman” has
re-emerged-- this time in London
where a jewel heist was underway--

(hears something in

her ear)
-- Excuse me we have breaking
news that the “Superman” was
spotted again-- this time in

And we see what they’re looking at the enormous mountain

ENTIRELY BARE -- THOUSANDS OF TREES BENT BACK An
incredible sight countless lives saved CUT TO

INT THE DAILY PLANET - DAY

RUSH THROUGH the office WITH JIMMY who carries a coffee
mug it’s a madhouse as Reporters on the phone watching
TVs on computers call out to each other trying to keep
up with the superhero that’s darting all over the planet

REPORTERS
(overlapping)
-- he was in Honduras -- d’you
have the report from Hong Kong I
got a witness in Egypt on line

-- and Jimmy passes Lois’ desk -- she’s on the phone
typing while conducting an urgent Superman witness
interview IN FRENCH She hands Jimmy her old coffee mug
as he hands her a new one She waves a thanks as Jimmy
continues passing CLARK KENT who has just entered
slightly out of breath

JIMMY
Hey you’re back Can you believe

CLARK

JIMMY

WHO Uh let me think --
Superman Maybe you should watch
the news you’re supposed to be
reporting That was mean how’s
your mom

CLARK
Shell be all right thanks

JIMMY
Glad you’re back

And Jimmy hurries off Clark just takes a moment looks
around the office People move motivated reporting on
Superman’s incredible good works He smiles at the
energy of the place at his most remarkable secret

That’s when something catches his attention at the banks
of TV MONITORS -- international broadcasts filling most
of the screens one screen carries a REPLAY of the LEX
LUTHOR PRESS CONFERENCE

Clark walks toward the monitor as Luthor addresses
camera -- a “LUTHOR PRESS CONFERENCE - YESTERDAY” CHYRON

( )

LUTHOR
» want to thank the members of
the press I’m using you today as
a conduit To send a simple
message to this visitor This
“Superman”

And keeping this subjective ALL SOUNDS OF THE OFFICE
FADE AWAY except Luthor’s VOICE

LUTHOR (CONT’D)
I’ve come into possession of some
crucial information for you

(beat)
Kal-El
TIGHT ON CLARK as he hears this -- as he gets a chill
down his spine -- as if hearing the name sparks something

Clark can’t possibly understand Confused concerned he
glances back at Lois for a moment who’s busy still on
the phone He looks back at the TV

LUTHOR (CONTD)
Superman If you can hear this
my name is Lex Luthor
(beat)
Come see me as soon as possible

And the TV GETS TURNED OFF and we realize that we’re no
longer in The Daily Planet -- but rather

INT LEX LUTHOR’S LEXCORP OFFICE — DAY

Luthor has just hit the remote -- his TVs all TURN OFF
He stands there pensive -- and then notices something
odd on the black TV screen he still sees Superman
Quickly realizing it’s a REFLECTION Luthor spins around

Superman stands on his balcony Luthor just stares for a
moment amazed Then he moves for the door opens it
Superman and Lex Luthor face each other for the first
time Hiding whatever his agenda is Luthor smiles

LUTHOR
You’re fast
(beat extends hand)
Lex Luthor

But Superman doesn’t shake his hand Instead

SUPERMAN
You used a word On TV You said
“Kal-El” What does that mean

( )

LUTHOR
What does it mean

With that Luthor actually begins to walk AROUND Superman
Checking him out Taking him in A control move

LUTHOR (CONT’D)
You don’t know Hm Hm-hm-hm
Let me get you a drink

SUPERMAN
No thank you

At his bar Luthor pours a scotch

LUTHOR
Considering what I’m about to say
you’re gonna need one

SUPERMAN
I said no
(then finds
strength)
And I asked you a question

Luthor drinks The whole glass Tastes nice

LUTHOR
One evening three decades ago I
had an encounter I was
enlightened I learned quite a
bit that night -- including the
possibility that an alien being
was living here Among us on
Earth A unique child Named Kal-

El
(beat)
That’s you
(then)

Kal were like twins you and I
I knew it the instant I learned
about you both cast away as
infants rejected by the societies
into which we were born Lost
souls

(then)
That night I was also made aware
of advanced science Technology
no human could ever conceive So
I used that knowledge -- that
innovation -- to find you
Listening to the world for any
hint that you might exist

(MORE )

( ) LUTHOR (CONTD)
Kal you’re the reason Lexcorp
exists at all

SUPERMAN
(grim skeptical)
You’ve been looking for me For
almost thirty years

LUTHOR
Yes So we could finally come
together As the architects that
save this planet

SUPERMAN
- really
Luthor happier than ever moves to a wall -- swings away
a large painting -- a German artist -- to reveal a

considerable WALL SAFE He begins working the dial

LUTHOR
I’m proudest of this achievement
Because this was MINE my own
thought this isn’t something I
was just GIVEN that night

SUPERMAN
A book
Luthor stops Realizes Superman has just looked into his
safe -- before he’s opened it Impressive
LUTHOR

Hm I call it my manifesto

CLANG Luthor opens the safe and pulls out a large-scale
hardback book SLAM Luthor puts it on his desk
Superman moves to it Cracks it open Begins looking at
the typeset pages And as he does

LUTHOR (CONT’D)
Through the years my theories have
been proven right time and again
I know I have the vision to pull
this off The intellect You
you have everything else

Superman’s eyes narrow flipping through pages of the
book Maps areas of the Earth CROSSED OUT New BORDERS
drawn Various MISSILES and WEAPONS illustrated on
various pages

SUPERMAN
You want countries destroyed

( )

LUTHOR
Well you can’t say it like THAT I
want to preserve the Earth Give
it a structure An order--

SUPERMAN
(eyes still on book)
-- by eliminating entire cultures

LUTHOR
Well yes some people have to GO
And while that might sound
radical Kal read my manifes-TOH

Superman has whip-fast grabbed Luthor by the collar --
pulling him close lifting him effortlessly off the
ground

SUPERMAN
People say you’re a deceitful
immoral scheming unethical
jackass

LUTHOR
Now hold on JACKASS

SUPERMAN
But it’s even worse than that
Youre insane

Superman shove-drops Luthor who falls-slides back on the
floor

SUPERMAN (CONT’D)
I’m gonna make sure you’re put
away

With that Superman suddenly FLIES OFF out the open
balcony door -- the suction of his departure creates an
INSTANT PAPER TORNADO in Luthor’s office Luthor is
quickly on his feet moving to the balcony YELLING OUT

LUTHOR
Hey a little advice You don’t
want me for an enemy People are
looking for you Kal And trust
me you don’t want them to find
you

OFF LUTHOR SEETHING

INT KELVIN OBSERVATORY —- DAY

Luthor BURSTS IN -- moves fast to the KRYPTONIAN POD
Opens the ship’s damaged hatch and climb inside Luthor
begins to operate the pod controls he learned about at
the hand of the dying Kryptonian His face illuminated
by the colorful instruments

A final key combination and the OBSERVATORY LIGHTS BROWN
OUT as an UNEARTHLY BEEPING BEGINS This is a BEACON
It’s working Luthor has called Superman’s true enemy
As our MUSIC BUILDS portending the evil that is to come

weighing the gravity and risk of what he’s just done

INT THE DAILY PLANET - FILING CABINETS — DAY

Lois is at a desk looking over the page layout on a
computer when Clark arrives

CLARK
Lois you got a minute

LOIS
Sure

And he takes her over to a corner of the office
Activity in the background But here they’re safe from
the office traffic

CLARK
It’s about Luthor I’ve been
reading up on him doing a
little digging myself I think
he’s actually pretty dangerous
And that maybe you should stay
away from him--

LOIS
What are you talking about Hey--
did you see his press conference
asking Superman to come hang out
Can you stand the guy’s nerve

Clark then decides to tell her Quieter
CLARK
I need to tell you something
Something important Something

you might not-- that you won’t
even believe Actually

LOIS
- Okay

A beat DAMN this is hard Lois watches him
concerned but a touch impatient Clark tries to talk
but it’s a real bitch telling someone that you are in
actuality a superhero

CLARK
- and I uh
(searching for words)
Lois I’ve never said this to

anyone before

It takes a beat but she gets it We see it in her face
she becomes VULNERABLE SWEET -- GUILTY EVEN

( )

LOIS
Oh my God Clark
CLARK
What
LOIS
I-- listen I I could tell
Clark stops -- he cannot believe this -- SHE KNOWS
CLARK

(amazed he whispers)
you-- you could TELL

LOIS

Yeah When you-- told me the
other night that we’d met before
I could see that you

(hard for her he’s

confused)
Clark you seem like a really
sweet guy but I’m not dating
anymore I can’t I’m no good in
relationships anyway I fall for
the wrong guys it’s just a really
stupid pattern--

CLARK
-- uh huh --

LOIS
-- and this isn’t an excuse this
is for real -- I mean classic me

The first guy I really FEEL
something for Right In maybe
forever Is probably not even
human So there ya go

LOIS

(almost embarrassed)
Such a cliché don’t even-- of
COURSE I fall for the guy who you
know flies Right You don’t
want anything to do with me -- and
look at you For any other girl
you’re a catch

(convincing herself)

A little stiff a little you
know but really CUTE just--

( ) LOIS (CONTD)

(musses his hair)
-- if you can loosen up a little--
what do you do with your hair
what is this

CLARK
(awkward straightens
his hair)
-- I don’t really--

LOIS
And you should think about laser
surgery because I think you
without glasses would be much--

She holds his glasses -- ABOUT TO PULL THEM OFF when

PERRY (0S)
LANE

LOIS TURNS AWAY JUST AS SHE REMOVES CLARK’S GLASSES -- HE
GRABS THEM PUTS THEM ON AS SHE TURNS BACK STRESSED

LOIS
Clark I’m sorry my story’s late

This conversation was enough to change his mind he won’t
be telling Lois the truth At least not yet

CLARK
That’s okay I understand

LOIS
(sweetly)
I’m I’m flattered though

And with a sweet smile she heads off Clark watches her
go Then

CLARK
Lois
(she turns a beat)
He called for you Superman

Her eyes narrow

LOIS
- is this you being mean

CLARK
No he called-- at least he said
it was him He wants to meet you
on the roof Tonight Eight
oclock

( )

LOIS
(stunned energized
but at a whisper )
Are you-- SUPERMAN CALLED FOR ME

CLARK
(smiles)
Yeah

She’s blown-away excited-nervous but trying to hide it

LOIS
Eight o’clock Okay Okay thank
you Excellent Thanks Eight
oclock Good

And she’s headed off Clark watches her go Suddenly

the lights in the office BROWN OUT Clark looks up

that was odd and with a sigh he heads off -- and as
moves past a COLUMN we SEAMLESSLY CUT TO

INT KANDOR WAR ROOM - NIGHT

-- a Lieutenant walks past a column of the WAR ROOM
Busy HOLOGRAMS and activity And we come to Ty-Zor who
sits with half a dozen elder GENERALS (including GENERAL
LAN 60) Ty-Zor’s certainly holding his own here --
feared and resented by his company Ty-Zor simply put
is the arrogant son of a king

TY-ZOR
General Lan you gave my father
your WORD--

GENERAL LAN
(hates him)
With all respect Sir it’s not as
if we aren’t already over-working
the laborers --

TY-ZOR
Without repair Krypton will fall
out of orbit Some say within a
year’s time -- you’ve seen the
rise in the oceans yourself the
winters we’ve--

GENERAL LAN
Well perhaps if Menna had not b--

The frustrated General stops himself -- realizes what
he’s saying And to whom Ty-Zor staring at him --
daring him to finish that sentence

( )

Then some at the table stand as Kata-Zor enters Ty-Zor

however remains seated

Kata-Zor moves off Ty-Zor still eyeing Lan

KATA-ZOR
A word with you

Kata-Zor moves to him

stands and

follows his father away from the activity of the room
where no one else can hear

KATA-ZOR (CONT’D)
We received a transmission
(beat impossibly)
We’ve located Kal-El
(Ty-Zor is stunned)
He’s on a planet in the Pireah
Range

Ty-Zor takes this in -- shocked at this Kata-Zor
meanwhile is shaken by the news -- as if his faith -- or
lack thereof -- is threatened

TY-ZOR

- you know what they would say
The slaves They believe in him

KATA-ZOR
Yes Their beliefs however are
of no concern to us

TY-ZOR

Perhaps they should be

(then)
Why take the risk You know as
well as I we can’t afford to

(finally)
Send me I will go alone And I
will return In that regard the
Prophecy will prove accurate

Kata-Zor considers this Finally

A strong look from Kata-Zor who turns
watch him go

KATA-ZOR
Then go Kill him And destroy
the place that gave him safe
haven

EXT THE DAILY PLANET —- ROOF —- NIGHT

leaving Ty-Zor to
Ty-Zor’s look fortifies as we CUT TO

EARTH -- or at least the SILVER GLOBE high atop the mid-

town Metropolis skyscraper

lit by giant arclights

( )

A chilly breeze blows Lois’ hair as she waits for
Superman Then she senses something and turns Superman
lands just twenty feet away A beat She does
everything she can to appear calm

LOIS
I-- so I got your message

SUPERMAN
I’m glad you came

LOIS
You know I didn’t get a chance to
thank you For saving my life

SUPERMAN
No need to thank me

He walks toward her -- she tenses like a nervous kid
Her nerves somehow make Superman (Clark of course)
calmer More confident

SUPERMAN (CONT’D)
You saw Lex Luthor’s press

conference
LOIS
(breathless)
-- yes --
SUPERMAN
I went to see him
LOIS
-- you did
SUPERMAN
He’s insane you know that
LOIS
-- I do--
SUPERMAN

Then do me a favor And stay as
far away from him as you can

LOIS
What What’s going on with
everyone I appreciate your
concern-- I’m perplexed by it
but I appreciate it-- but
Superman I’m a reporter this is
what I do I’ma big girl I can
take care of myself

( )

Superman looks at Lois A subtle sigh being superhuman
is irrelevant when it comes to controlling Lois Lane

LOIS (CONTD)
-- and why are you doing this
anyway Singling me out at the
stadium calling me tonight
(beat)
I mean why me

Because he loves her that’s why

SUPERMAN
You’re a good writer

LOIS
« you you’ve read my WRITING

SUPERMAN
I like what you wrote about
flying

LOIS

(embarrassed)
I Okay you read that one--
Listen I only made the comparison-
- flying to sex -- because my
editor-- total old-school classic-
- but brilliant guy-- was like
“you can’t write about flying

Lois you don’t fly” -- so I had
to speculate what--
SUPERMAN

Then I’1l1 show you
She freezes What A sexy proposition comes next

SUPERMAN (CONT ’D)
Wanna fly

Lois is overcome Superman holds out his hand
Nervously she takes it He turns her so that her back
is to him He moves up against her wraps his right arm
around her waist She can barely take being this close
to him

SUPERMAN (CONT ’D)
-- just hold on --

LOIS

(terrified)
-- uh-huh

( )

He gently lifts her one foot off the roof two feet
five feet fifteen feet and then out off the roof
out over the street and she suddenly PANICS -- blurts out
a SCREAM and wraps her legs around his body gripping
madly -- so Superman stumbles in the air and she SCREAMS
again -- he gets his bearings
SUPERMAN

Trust me
She nods And he grips her safely and with his arm
wrapped around her they move skyward

EXT SKY -— NIGHT

We follow Superman and Lois as they slowly traverse
Metropolis buildings at first nervously their moves are
insecure and self-conscious Rough and graceless But
after a few moments Lois begins to trust Superman even
more And Superman begins to trust himself

When they fly over the Metropolis Bridge following its
structural curves up and down they actually start to
enjoy themselves Superman holds her almost giving her
the experience of flying on her own Then he flies
upside-down holding her waist but now flying right
below her She laughs at how remarkable this all is

Then Superman sets her down on the ANTENNA TIP of a
Metropolis skyscraper He then simply holds her hand --
it’s like she’s a ballerina A princess dancing where
no one has danced before As out MUSIC SOARS CUT TO

EXT THE DAILY PLANET —- ROOF —- NIGHT

But before he can finish the question LOIS IS AGGRESSIVE
AS HELL KISSING HIM HARD ARMS WRAPPED AROUND HIS HEAD

Shocked for a moment Superman kisses her back -- and
suddenly SHE STOPS horrified by her behavior she
hurries away her back now facing his

absolutely unacceptable -- Superm--
I am so sorry--

Superman smiles wide his back still to Lois who has a
sudden flight reflex

SUPERMAN
- it’s-- not a problem --

-- I have to g-- I should r-- you
probably have place to-- lives to

Superman just smiles -- how nervous she is

SUPERMAN
I’1l get in touch with you

Their eyes meet -- and Lois LAUGHS as she heads inside
We stay on Superman BEAMING -- the happiest he’s been in
his life and in exuberance he TAKES OFF INTO THE SKY as

Underneath all that stubbornness

There’s no future in Superman

HOLD ON LUTHOR as a DEEP RUMBLING grows Unclear at
first what this is but it gets LOUDER -- and now Luthor
hears it -- smiles

LUTHOR (CONT’D)
Speaking of which you came here
for a story Welcome to the
biggest story of all time

And Luthor quickly heads off --

Luthor moves out and looks into the sky as SOMETHING HUGE
IS LANDING It must be a CRAFT of some kind -- but it’s
CAMOUFLAGED -- the massive thing appearing only like HEAT

A GROAN-HISS is HEARD from the Rouser -- a HATCH OPENS
and then SOMEONE APPEARS IT’S TY-ZOR THE MURDERER OF
SUPERMANS MOTHER NOW STANDS ON PLANET EARTH

Lois can’t breathe Ty-Zor looks around taking in the
area And Luthor steps toward him SPEAKING KRYPTONIAN

Zor From now on Luthor SPEAKS ENGLISH

Are there any more of you

SHOT HE RIPS OFF HIS CLOTHES TRANSFORMS INTO SUPERMAN
TAKES OFF AND SAILS THROUGH THE WINDOW FLYING OFF IN A
BLUR THE VACUUM EFFECT SUCKS his work clothes and
anything else in the hall out the window after him --

EXT KELVIN OBSERVATORY - DAY
Lois continues to watch as Luthor explains

LUTHOR
For someone like you with your
considerable abilities finding
Kal-El should be simple Go to
one of our cities Metropolis is
just a jump and skip for you --
just cause some damage Do some
bad things I guarantee you he’1l
show up And when he does -- once
youve done your thing I was
hoping you might reciprocate A
little quid pro quo return the
favor and help ME with a little
“face lift” I want to give this
planet

Ty-Zor looks at Luthor actually amused by him You
almost see the “why not humor him” Cross his face

( )

TY-ZOR
Certainly It would be a pleasure
to repay you

LUTHOR
It was a calculated risk calling
you I KNEW it would pay off

Suddenly a DISTANT WHISTLE is HEARD -- Ty-Zor and Luthor
turn as Superman approaches in the sky --

We then FLY WITH SUPERMAN as he sees the landed ROUSER --
his brain twists WHAT THE HELL IS THIS Fear plays on
his face this is a far deeper problem than he expected
to find Still quickly powerfully he LANDS forming a
PERFECT TRIANGLE with Ty-Zor and Luthor each fifty feet
away from the other

LOIS is relieved at the sight of Superman who dismayed
and aghast looks from the Rouser to Ty-Zor

SUPERMAN
- who are you

LUTHOR
(to Ty-Zor sotto)
Do your thing my friend

TY-ZOR
You look just like her Kal-El
(then glowering)
Your mother

Superman stares bewildered -- heart pounding Then
tauntingly

TY-ZOR (CONT’D)
She cried you know Helpless as
she was In that moment just
before I ended her life

Superman begins to understand the horror that is Ty-Zor

LUTHOR
- that was good
TY-ZOR
Let’s see if you CRY like her
too “Superman”
Whip-fast Ty-Zor pulls out a BLASTAFF and FIRES -- the
ENERGY BLAST HITS SUPERMAN HARD -- Lois SCREAMS as

Superman is SLAMMED BACK landing hard dazed Ty-Zor
LEAPS over to him smiles looking down upon him

Superman struggles to recover -- Ty-Zor PUNCHES SUPERMAN
SUPER HARD -- SLAM Again -- and just before the third
Superman FIGHTS BACK HE POWER-ELBOWS TY-ZOR IN THE HEAD —-

and into the observatory main area SLAMMING INTO A BANK
OF METAL SHELVES WHICH CRASH TO THE FLOOR -- REVEALING
LARGE CHUNKS OF GREEN ROCK FUEL FROM THE KRYPTONIAN POD
WHICH CRASHED YEARS AGO

Suddenly Superman and Ty-Zor both about fifteen feet
away from the rock pieces STRUGGLE -- both instantly
depleted of energy in pain and laboring --

Luthor races in -- and to his shock finds the two super-
strength enemies in agony Luthor’s face contorts WHAT
THE HELL IS THIS AND WE SEE LUTHOR PUT IT TOGETHER

That’s when Superman sees LOIS held by Dunn at gunpoint

He suddenly toils to move toward her (something Luthor
watches as well)

( )

At the same moment Ty-Zor takes a deep breath and in an

angry burst BLOWS THE KRYPTONITE -- and most other
things -- ACROSS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM -- far
enough away for him -- and Superman -- to slowly regain

their strength

Dunn backs away as Superman strives to get to his feet --
but just as he does TY-ZOR TACKLES SUPERMAN

Superman goes down hard as Ty-Zor ATTACKS these are
FURIOUS BRUTAL UNFORGIVING BLOWS that are heartbreaking
to behold Lois witness to this horror SCREAMS OUT

Superman CRASHES TO HIS KNEES His skins BLISTERS now
Superman opens his eyes -- ROLLED BACK BLOODSHOT -- and
he SCREAMS And so does Lois in the water for Superman
to stay away Then BEHIND SUPERMAN LUTHOR APPEARS
holding a chunk of the GREEN ROCK There’s no escape for
Superman Luthor walks past Superman with a cocky
confidence that makes us hate him only more

LUTHOR
Let’s talk about your attitude
(beat)
I tried to include you Kal But
you threatened me So this is
what you get

Veins begin to appear on Superman’s skin as he gets

closer to Lois who is desperate for air -- and for
Superman to save himself But through the pain he moves
closer to her -- to the tank and the deadly green rock --

LUTHOR (CONT’D)
I’m embarrassed That I didn’t
figure it out sooner The
Kryptonite THE ROCK The fuel
from the ship -- THAT’S what
killed the soldier they sent to
find you Do you like the name
“Kryptonite” That’s mine

Superman’s SKIN BLISTERS now -- evidence of the
devastating effects of Kryptonite Lois cries
underwater knowing that his attempt to save her will
mean his life

We DOLLY WITH SUPERMAN as he strains to the wall of glass
-- the DEADLY GREEN ROCK and the WOMAN HE LOVES submerged
in water behind it Superman PULLS HIS ARM BACK and
POUNDS the glass -- but his powers are gone now -- in
fact he’s so weak that any of us could have hit the

glass harder Luthor is close by watching the pathetic -
- and failing -- attempt to save his love

( )

Lois furiously shakes her head the last oxygen bubbling
from her mouth -- Superman pulls his arm back and STRIKES
THE GLASS AGAIN -- then AGAIN -- but the blows are
pointless he leans against the glass crying himself
his life force depleting -- and their eyes meet -- two
souls on the verge of death -- a moment so heartbreaking
we should be in tears

Lois’ eyes close -- she seems to die right before us
Just then with every ounce of strength he’s got left --
Superman PULLS HIS ARM BACK AND WITH SURPRISING POWER
SLAMS IT INTO THE GLASS -- it SHATTERS -- THE WATER THE
ROCK AND LOIS RUSH OUT OF THE TANK INTO THE ROOM --
THRUSTING SUPERMAN BACK --

Lois lies there motionless Luthor pleased moves to
Superman who is by now moments from death Luthor
holds a football-sized chunk of Kryptonite and kneels
over him Places the rock on Superman’s chest
Superman’s breathing erratic a faint panting

LUTHOR (CONT’D)
Painful isn’t it Being so close
to something so powerful

I mean ME of course not the
Kryptonite

In that instant Superman EXHALES long and final His
head goes limp He is dead SIMULTANEOUSLY

INT JOR-EL’S CELL - NIGHT

Jor-El suddenly awakens Alone here his face ravaged by
age and abuse No sound has awoken him no touch or
prodding -- but rather a SENSE AN EMOTIONAL INNATE
UNDERSTANDING WHICH TRANSCENDS TIME AND DISTANCE

In this moment Jor-El simply KNOWS that his son is dead
His eyes go wide -- tears flood his eyes Not out of
sorrow but rather disbelief that the moment he’d been
waiting for so many years has come

Then Luthor turns -- startled as we are to see that
facing him is a furious confident and vengeful LOIS

EIGHT WILD FEROCIOUS BLOWS THAT SEND LEX LUTHOR UP
BACK THEN DOWN HARD Seemingly instantly he’s
unconscious

THE AUDIENCE WILL GO INSANE

we first met him He looks handsome Imperious But
perhaps most importantly he’s in awe In awe of the

JOR-EL
Kal-El no words can make up for
what we’ve lost
(beat)
Ive been waiting for this For
years

SUPERMAN
It was you You sent me away

( )

JOR-EL
Yes And now my son you must go
back

SUPERMAN

«» go back Where How can--

JOR-EL
Because it was written Thousands
of generations ago To those who
believe the Prophecy speaks of
Krypton A war waged by and
against a single family It tells
of two princes and the battle they
will fight We know that of the

two only one prince will
return
SUPERMAN
-- a prince I am no prince
JOR-EL
-- yes--
SUPERMAN
-- no I live on Earth--
JOR-EL
-- in a home which I selected

(then)
I chose the Kents because they
were decent Virtuous I could
see they would raise you well
And keep the Key safe

SUPERMAN

- the Key
(then realizing)
- those five pieces

JOR-EL
The Symbols of Menna

Jor-El moves to his son Points (but does not touch)
each symbol on Superman’s chest

JOR-EL (CONT’D)
Each piece a representation
Faith Wisdom Courage Love
And sacrifice There is a priest -
- Hen-Gra He will explain the
Key help you with the knowledge
you need

( )

What does THAT mean Superman just stares at him --
takes a leap assumes for a minute all of this is true

SUPERMAN
This prophecy What happens when
the prince returns

JOR-EL

The last pages have never been
found But you will understand
You will know the right thing to
do

(beat)
My son I can give you life now
I can give you all I’ve seen all
I know But what you do with that
knowledge the outcome will
be decided by you

Superman looks off trying to take this all in --

JOR-EL (CONT’D)
(quiet intense)
Your mother and I were afraid as
well The morning we sent you
away Please Please believe
in yourself as much as I do

AND JOR-EL EMBRACES HIS SON AS SUPERMAN DOES HIS FATHER
SUPERMAN INHALES -- INFUSED -- AS JOR-EL EXHALES SPENT —--

INT JOR-EL’S CELL - NIGHT

Where we left Jor-El on his knees he COLLAPSES -- hits

Guards unlock the cell and burst in -- Kata-Zor grabs his

lifeless brother knowing he’s been bested as

INT KELVIN OBSERVATORY — DAY

Lois’ lips finally touch Superman’s -- AND IN THAT
INSTANT HE GASPS -- LOIS SCREAMS HORRIFIED falling back
and scampering on the floor SCARED TO DEATH --

LOIS
OH MY GOD I’M SORRY I KEEP
KISSING YOU I THOUGHT YOU WERE
DEAD

Superman stands stronger healthier than ever -- a
confident stance as he moves to Lois takes her hand

( )

SUPERMAN
Are you all right

LOIS
-- God are YOU

A DISTANT HORRIBLE THUNDER Superman turns at the sound -
- then back to Lois helps her up

SUPERMAN
-- hold on tight --

He grabs Lois wraps her in his CAPE and TAKES OFF --
blasting through the observatory roof --

EXT ROAD - DAY
Middle of nowhere Superman sets Lois down says firmly

SUPERMAN
Now I know you-- you’re gonna want
to get involved in this DON’T
Stay safe

And Before she can respond again Superman takes off

EXT METROPOLIS - DAY

Jimmy HAIR BLOWN BACK in the EXHAUST GUST watches as

two blocks away the ROUSER SLOWLY LIFTS OFF -- MILITARY
JETS APPEARING -- two F-18s which FIRE MISSILES AT THE
ROUSER -- the Rouser gets hit -- the missiles do nothing -
- and Ty-Zor FIRES AT THE JETS -- the pilots EJECT just

as the two jets EXPLODE in the sky above Metropolis --

INT KANDOR WAR ROOM - NIGHT

Kata-Zor bursts into the crowded space anxious and
irritable calling out to the HOLOGRAM of Ty-Zor

KATA-ZOR

HAS NOT BEEN KILLED

INT ROUSER CONTROL STATION - NIGHT
Lifting off Ty-Zor reacts incredulous

TY-ZOR
But Father I saw him dead

KATA-ZOR
THE SON OF JOR-EL LIVES

And Ty-Zor’s head whips over at an APPROACHING WHISTLE --

EXT METROPOLIS - DAY

In a RED STREAK IN THE SKY and Superman comes to the
aerial equivalent of a BRAKE-SLAMMING SCREECH STOP -- a
block away from the monster Rouser which TURNS IN MID
AIR hovering LOUDLY facing Superman Ty-Zor piloting
sees him -- and brings the Rouser to a sudden hard
QUAKING LANDING

Superman faces the thing with a rage and determination we
haven’t seen on his face before Fighting this machine
is the battle he must fight -- in order to get to the
beast inside

Jimmy holding the video camera tapes this freaking
out

JIMMY
HE’S BACK HE’S ALIVE

Just as Superman flies toward the Rouser Ty-Zor FIRES --
A DOZEN ENERGY BLASTS SLAM INTO SUPERMAN who is thrown
back powerfully -- painfully He lands hard but is
light-years from giving up -- he STREAK-FLIES back to the
Rouser -- and Ty-Zor FIRES -- but this time Superman
DODGES the SPIRALLING ENERGY BLASTS ACROBATICALLY IN THE
SKY -- Superman SLAMS his shoulder against the machine
STRAINING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TO UP-END the thing -- to
render it useless --

But Ty-Zor activates various controls and TURRETS APPEAR
from beneath the battle machine’s armor -- and in the
same instant that Superman sees these weapons aimed at
him TY-ZOR FIRES -- Superman gets POUNDED down slamming
into the street SHATTERING asphalt And Superman has no
time to recover he FLIES out of the way just as Ty-Zor
FIRES AT THE STREET where Superman just landed

INT KANDOR WAR ROOM - NIGHT

Kata-Zor and the others anxiously watch the brutal fight

EXT METROPOLIS - DAY

The battle is classic Superman giant machine fighting
our hero in the canyons of Metropolis -- is wickedly fast
cat-and-mouse -- Superman flying around the tank-monster
grabbing it trying to HEAVE IT OVER as Ty-Zor COUNTER-
MANEUVERS hitting controls madly the Rouser’s various
WEAPONS APPEARING FOLDING OUT revealing its dozens of
deadly options and once Superman finally grabs onto the
side of it again Ty-Zor RAMS THE ROUSER -- and his enemy
-- into “BURKY’S DEPARTMENT STORE” destroying the
building’s facade as they wrestle

Meanwhile Jimmy Olsen VIDEOTAPES the whole thing from a
relatively-safe distance he has to run to avoid GIANT
PIECES OF DEBRIS which Superman and the Rouser kick up --

EXT TOWN — DAY

Lois out of breath runs arriving at a typical small
US town Could be Barstow could be Bangor Curious and
desperate she spots a large group of horrified PEOPLE
gathered outside a barber shop -- she hurries there to
see that they’re all watching the TV THE VIDEO SHOT BY
JIMMY OF SUPERMAN BATTLING THE ROUSER IN METROPOLIS --

Shaken she turns to the large 40-ish GUY in a jean
jacket who stands beside her watching the TV

LOIS
Excuse me I know this sounds
insane -- but Sir I need to

borrow a car

A grim look from the man He obviously believes the end
of the world is at hand He just holds out his keys

GUY

Take it It’s all over anyway
This lands for Lois -- then
LOIS

Where is it

The Guy gestures -- Lois’ eyes flick to the HARLEY-
DAVIDSON MOTORCYCLE parked at the curb A beat Then

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

LOIS BLASTS down the road on the Harley speeding like a
maniac on the bike -- no traffic headed toward Metropolis
-- but GRIDLOCK headed out -- she THUNDERS AHEAD --

INT KELVIN OBSERVATORY - NIGHT

Luthor SITS UP waking from his Lois-beating FURIOUS

EXT KELVIN OBSERVATORY —- DAY

Luthor hurries out here having just awoken running
toward the Helicopter which Dunn has ready to go --

EXT METROPOLIS - DAY

Superman’s battle against the Rouser continues -- he
manages to get under the belly of the Rouser PUSHING
with all his might -- SCREAMING as he forces the
impossibly heavy giant metal beast to a TILT -- Ty-Zor
scrambles to maintain footing but Superman’s too damn
strong -- and like David against Goliath Superman
finally scores a win as he PUSHES THE ROUSER OVER -- the
huge machine CRASHES TO THE STREET

Ty-Zor scurries in the cockpit to right the thing
Superman attempts to PRY OPEN THE ROUSER -- Ty-Zor sees
this and grabs the HELLFIRE TRIGGER and ENERGY BLASTS HIT
SUPERMAN again sending Superman TUMBLING BACK

He turns back to the crippled Rouser Using his X-RAY
VISION Superman looks INSIDE OF IT WE SEE the intricate
inner-workings the weaponry the thousands of miles of
cabling the amazing Kryptonian machinery -- Ty-Zor in
the cockpit -- and everything seems to converge at the
MAIN ENERGY SOURCE in the Rouser’s underbelly --

So as Ty-Zor strains with the controls trying to right
the mega-chine -- the Rouser LURCHING its legs TURNING
and CLAWING its THRUSTERS spastically FIRING Superman
TAKES OFF -- Jimmy watches Superman go following the RED
STREAK in the sky with the video camera --

EXT INTERNATIONAL REACTIONS - VARIOUS

-- a quick return to the places we’ve seen -- France
Egypt Kenya -- a visual MONTAGE of various FACES OF THE
WORLD everyone fearful their futures at the mercy of
this battle The reaction is shock -- fear --
disappointment that Superman would abandon them --

EXT SPACE

As seen from space as SUPERMAN appears angry and
determined flying toward the stars He then U-TURNS and
BULLETS BACK TO EARTH --

EXT SKY -— DAY TO NIGHT

SUPERMAN RIPS OVER THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET AT 10000
FEET -- THROUGH TIME ZONES DAY TO NIGHT AND BACK AGAIN --
and OVER THE OCEANS -- a MAMMOTH SALTWATER WAKE BEHIND

HIM -- and then he ZOOMS INTO METROPOLIS where he

SUDDENLY IMPACTS THE VULNERABLE SPOT OF THE ROUSER AND

THE THING IMPLODES before it EXPLODES -- and when it does
it’s TREMENDOUS A WILD MULTICOLORED BLAST WHICH ROCKS
THE CITY Jimmy is thrown back in the concussion --

INT KANDOR WAR ROOM - NIGHT

-- the EXPLOSION is witnessed in the HOLOGRAM VIEW -- the
HOLOGRAM RECEPTION MOMENTARILY INTERRUPTED -- Kata-Zor
and the Lieutenants suddenly SILENT IN SHOCK --

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

From the EXPLOSION in the distance we quickly PAN to
Lois speeding with her as she rides like a Superbike
champion -- making a scary-fast lane change passing a
“METROPOLIS DOWNTOWN - NEXT EXIT” sign --

EXT METROPOLIS - DAY

Images of the intense aftermath of the explosion
Destruction and debris which still rains upon the
streets The few people that remain in the area are
running off or driving away wherever possible

And we find Ty-Zor who lies amid the massive rubble
PUSH IN ON HIM splayed looking broken and dazed But
far from dead In fact he’s REALLY PISSED OFF now

( )

And he strains to get up -- dirty and dusty now like a
desert warrior He scans the urban war zone for his
nemesis -- when he’s SUDDENLY TACKLED HARD BY SUPERMAN --

They land powerfully ripping up asphalt -- and the FINAL
BATTLE BEGINS Until now Ty-Zor has always had the
advantage But no longer As much as Ty-Zor tries to
fight in his elegantly brutal well-trained way Superman
is the stronger and more determined of the two

Yes it’s Superman Yes he’s an icon of all that is
moral and good But that doesn’t mean he won’t defend
himself -- and in this kill-or-be-killed scenario he must
be as ruthless and clever as his opponent -- which is
just what happens as far as being ruthless is concerned
his attack on Ty-Zor is blow-for-blow every damn thing
Ty-Zor deserves A potent combination of speed and
might Superman dominates TY-ZOR -- SLAMMING him with his
fists cracking him hard with his boots deflecting every
defense and shocking Ty-Zor with his fierce skill And
during all this

INT KANDOR WAR ROOM - NIGHT

Everyone watches silent Kata-Zor’s heart pounding --

EXT METROPOLIS - DAY

Superman lands five powerful punches in a row then flips
Ty-Zor into the street Ty-Zor lands there in a daze as
Superman approaches him a dark enraged man

SUPERMAN
I saw it Ty-Zor What you did to
my mother I WAS THERE So this
This is for her

Superman grabs Ty-Zor and HURLS HIM -- as he did Superman

-- Ty-Zor is thrown into a large pile of building RUBBLE
SLAMMING into it

EXT METROPOLIS STREET - DAY

Just as Lois ROARS into the city on her borrowed bike --
she SKIDS in a WIDE TURN five blocks from Superman --
EXT METROPOLIS - DAY

Superman grabs Ty-Zor -- is just about to POUND HIM again

when Superman suddenly HEARS BEEPING HIS HEAD WHIPS TO
THE SPIKE BOMB WHICH HE SEES PLANTED A BLOCK AWAY

( )

AND SUPERMAN KNOWS THIS IS A BOMB THAT WILL DESTROY THE
PLANET Realizing the threat and that he must respond
he drops his hateful enemy and quickly flies to the bomb

Superman attempts to pull up the spike bomb -- it’s a
horrible struggle -- he rips off the CAP grabbing the
foot-thick and seemingly endless COIL that has been
burrowed deep into the Earth He’s about to fly off with
it when he turns -- AND SEES TY-ZOR HOLDING a STATION
WAGON above his head AND THERE’S A COUPLE IN THE CAR
SCREAMING Superman realizes what’s happening -- and Ty-
Zor THROWS THE CAR across the city -- Superman
instinctively drops the bomb and SPEEDS THROUGH THE SKY
GRABBING THE STATION WAGON before it hits a building --
the MAN and WOMAN in the car in shock --

MAN BEHIND WHEEL
-- thank you --

Superman looks down -- Ty-Zor has ANOTHER CAR -- a VAN
with a MAN in it -- and Superman realizes TY-ZOR IS
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SUPERMAN’S VULNERABILITY -- HIS
DESIRE TO SAVE PEOPLE And Ty-Zor THROWS the van --
Superman RACES DOWN -- quickly sets down the station
wagon and SPEEDS THROUGH THE AIR for the Van -- just as
LOIS arrives on the bike -- looking up horrified

Superman grabs the VAN -- sending him back against a

building’s 20th story window -- SPIDERING the glass

Just as on the street SCREEEECH Jimmy stops right
beside Lois driving the NEWS VAN

JIMMY
GET IN

And Lois does -- and TY-ZOR SEES LOIS GETTING IN THE VAN
just as Superman does still holding the Van And Ty-Zor
FLIES TO THE NEWSVAN grabs it lifts it above his head
Inside LOIS AND JIMMY SCREAM WILDLY -- Superman’s eyes
flick to the SPIKE BOMB -- BEEPING TWO BLOCKS AWAY
LOUDER NOW -- ABOUT TO EXPLODE -- WHAT THE HELL DOES HER
DO

Superman then does something GENIUS -- he SMASHES THE VAN
INTO THE BUILDING WINDOW YELLING TO THE MAN INSIDE

SUPERMAN
GET OUT

The man jumps out of the van onto the tenth floor of the
building -- then just as Ty-Zor THROWS THE NEWS VAN
Superman THROWS THE VAN AT TY-ZOR The Van SLAMS INTO TY-
ZOR LIKE A BOWLING BALL -- Ty-Zor falls back --

( )

Superman BULLETS TO THE NEWS VAN -- Superman GRABS THE
NEWSVAN sets it atop the closest building roof The
Daily Planet roof And in a BLUR he arrives at the SPIKE
BOMB -- he grabs the coil and FLIES INTO THE SKY pulling
the thing out of the planet -- the coil’s thousands of
feet long -- and as the BEEPING INCREASES -- as Superman
bullets upward with the heavy planet destroyer -- TY-ZOR
stirs He begins to awaken in the rubble He shakes off
his fog Wounded and bloody Ty-Zor looks up -- sees the
bomb still being carried at speed into the sky
Glowering at Superman and gathering his strength Ty-Zor
flies to the spike bomb just as the explosive BULB at
the end whips out of the hole -- and Ty-Zor grabs the end
of the bomb --

EXT THE DAILY PLANET

Lois and Jimmy watch as Superman and Ty-Zor fly off --

EXT SKY - DAY

Suddenly Superman is yanked to a stop -- he turns to see
Ty-Zor holding on to the other end of the spike bomb a
mile away And they each begin PULLING -- each of these

powerful beings struggle to pull the thing away from the
other --

Superman on the DETONATOR side Ty-Zor on the EXPLOSIVE
CHARGE side Superman has the edge straining pulling

the thing up thousands of feet above Metropolis -- even
as Ty-Zor struggles to pull the bomb back to the planet --

Finally -- just as Superman pulls Ty-Zor high enough
above the city for no structural damage to occur THE
SPIKE BOMB DETONATES -- the earth sky filled with an

IMPOSSIBLY BRIGHT LIGHT --

Lois and Jimmy shield their eyes from the explosion --

The room reacts with subtle disbelief -- Kata-Zor stares
still trusting --

TY-ZOR

And Ty-Zor reaches out for Superman’s help with one hand -
- but with the other he secretly pulls a KRYPTONIAN

BLADE from a boot holster Superman moves closer to take
Ty-Zor’s hand -- and their hands touch -- Superman helps
up Ty-Zor who then LUNGES AT SUPERMAN WITH HIS BLADE --
but Superman anticipating this (here’s the “clever” part
which goes with the “ruthless” part) purposely FALLS TO
HIS BACK ROLLING therefore FLIPPING TY-ZOR who is
thrown back INTO THE SKYLIGHT which SHATTERS --

So maybe well see each other an--

And Superman GRABS HER AND KISSES HER -- and she kisses

EXT KENT FARM —- DUSK

The most beautiful sight The farm we first saw thirty
years ago Silhouetted against the pink sky standing
alone in the field of wheat is Superman He looks out
at the land where he was raised His eyes searching for
an answer on the horizon Then he looks into his palm
Holds the Five Pieces Arranges them in the form of the
“s

( )

Then in the middle of the wheat field in front of him
something happens the dry earth begins to RISE ina
MOUND -- what in the world is this Nothing from this
world as the wheat and dirt falls to the side a large
Kryptonian SPACECRAFT is revealed Something Jor-El left
for his son years ago It LIFTS gently until it
hovers just at ground level A portal OPENS

And Superman just stares at the craft at once determined
and afraid Then he turns standing near the house
having just witnessed it too is Martha Kent

Superman moves to her Mother and son share a look
then they embrace Trying to sound strong but her voice
cracking she speaks

MARTHA
Love you sweetheart

And the look Superman gives her the look of a man who
knows courage Wisdom Faith Love And Sacrifice

Moments later she watches as a BRILLIANT LIGHT
illuminates the farm -- the spacecraft’s THRUSTERS
showering the place in WHITE LIGHT And as our MUSIC
RISES the craft lifts off carrying Superman into the
heavens Beginning the journey of his lifetime

And Martha Kent watches as The Light lifts into the sky
Her heart full Proud of her son

CUT TO BLACK
