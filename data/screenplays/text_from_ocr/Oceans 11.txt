DANNY
Im a free man

INT CHANGING CUBICLE

Danny pulls on civilian clothes and theres not a bare
thread among them He tugs his cuffs and smiles The
old skin feels good One last item to don a silver
wedding band Danny considers it Will he put it on

EXT MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - FRONT GATE - AFTERNOON

A sign reads NEW JERSEY STATE MINIMUM-SECURITY
CORRECTIONAL FACILITY Someone has graffitied below it
If you were in prison youd be home now

The great metal door opens and Danny stands within its
frame ready for release (If it matters -- and if you
notice -- hes wearing his wedding ring)

He hovers there for a moment on the precipice of
freedom The WIND WHISTLES a little on the other side of
the gate and the view ahead is not pleasant (New
Jersey) Life is hard out there

But Danny musters his courage then takes his first step
into free America
EXT ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK - DUSK

Any empty wintery boardwalk

INT CASINO (ATLANTIC CITY) - NIGHT

--- And his wingtip lands squarely on plush red
carpeting

As we PULL UP TO Dannys face and SPIN AROUND him we
hear then see the BUZZ of a CASINO floor the HUM of
CONVERSATION the DING-DING-DING and THUNK-THUNK-THUNK
from the SLOTS the brisk WHIR of SHUFFLED CARDS

And to Danny its a hearth and fire and a comfy chair
and a snifter of brandy Hes home

ON DANNYS WALLET

As he pulls out several crisp one hundreds sets them on

green felt then sees them replaced by a neat pile of
chips

A6
AT BLACKJACK TABLE

Danny cranes his neck about the casino looking for
someone -- a friend somebody who should be here -- but
without success He turns his attention back to his
cards and the cards of the dealer

Nine-ten Stay Dealer -- seventeen Danny wins
King-four Dealer shows a six Stick Dealer busts
Queen-ace Twenty-one Danny wins again

A second dealer relieves the first and Danny recognizes
him with a smile -- this wasnt the friend he was
scouting for but two hours out of the joint any familiar
face is welcome

DANNY
Hello Frank

The new dealer (FRANK CATTON) glances up at Danny and
his eyes go wide like a priest whos discovered hes
dealing communion wafers to the pontiff himself He
quickly hides his astonishment

FRANK
I beg your pardon sir You must
have me confused with someone
else My name is Ramon See

He taps the name embroidered on his vest although he is
the most African-looking Ramon youve ever seen A pit
boss circles close by and glares at them both

DANNY
My mistake
(collecting his chips
doubled)
Tables cold anyway

FRANK
You might try the lounge at the
Grand sir It gets busy around
one

DANNY

(as he goes)
Thanks

INT LOUNGE AT GRAND
Danny checks his watch -- 1258 -- then the lounge around
him prison had more nightlife He nurses a bourbon

folds back the New York Times and scans

visible) woman on his arm The second scowling former

INT LIBRARY TOWER - 40TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT 19

Lights out on the 40th Engraved brass announces JA
KUEHN and ASSOCIATES ARCHITECTS

Two flashlight beams strafe wood-paneled elegant
offices Danny and Rusty on late-night reconnaissance
As Danny prowls a cabinet full of blueprints Rusty
passes the time switching papers from a desks in box to
its out box

At last Danny finds the right set of blueprints and
drapes it across the desk we however never see it

DANNY
The vault at the Bellagio

A beat as Rusty scans the document then another
underneath it

RUSTY
If Im reading these right -- and
I think that I am -- this is
probably the least accessible
vault ever designed

(beat)

Oops Actually you know what
Im wrong Its definitely the
least accessible vault ever
designed

DANNY
Yep

Rustys brow furrows just a little

( )

OCEANS 11 - Rev 1801 14

RUSTY
You said three casinos

DANNY
(flips to next
blueprint)
These feed into the cages at both
the Mirage and the MGM Grand
(tapping vault)
But every dime ends up here

RUSTY
The Bellagio Mirage and These
are Terry Benedicts places

DANNY
Yes they are Think hell mind

RUSTY
More than somewhat

AT 40TH FLOOR ELEVATOR BAY

No ding The elevator just arrives Its doors part to
reveal a SECURITY GUARD within here to make his tour a
large fellow he has to duck to exit

BACK WITH DANNY AND RUSTY

As Danny rolls up the set of blueprints Rusty considers
the plan (which in our absence Danny has pitched him)

RUSTY
Youd need at least a dozen guys
doing a combination of cons

DANNY
Like what you think

RUSTY

Well off the top of my head Id
say youre looking at a Boesky a
Jim Brown a Miss Daisy two
Jethros and a Leon Spinks Oh
and the biggest Ella Fitzgerald
ever

(beat)
Where do you think youre gonna get
the money to back this

OCEANS 11 - Rev 1801 15

DANNY

as he approaches Dannys and Rustys voices

23 BACK WITH DANNY AND RUSTY
DANNY

should take this plan kick it
around for a week or two Sleep
on it Turn it over in your head
Then never bring it up to me

again

DANNY
Uh-huh So what are you saying

RUSTY
Im saying this is like trying
to build a house of cards on the
deck of a speeding boat

DANNY
Really I thought it was much
harder than that --

Suddenly the Security Guards flashlight beam hits them
square in the eyes Danny and Rusty put their hands up
to block the light

DANNY
Jesus Oscar lower it a little
will ya

OCEANS 11 - Rev 102400 16

hundreds and buries them in the Security Guards hand

DANNY
Preciate it
AT 40TH FLOOR ELEVATOR BAY

Danny and Rusty wait for an elevator When its doors
open Rusty stops Danny from boarding

RUSTY
I need a reason And dont say
money
(beat)
Why do this
DANNY

Why not do it
Rusty stares at him enough bullshitting around

DANNY
Because yesterday I walked out of
the joint wearing my entire
wardrobe and youre colddecking
TeenBeat coverboys

(beat)

Because the house always wins
You play long enough never
changing stakes the house takes
you Unless when that special
hand comes around you bet big
And then you take the house

A beat Rusty smiles

RUSTY

One passenger in particular keeps his footing a young
man in a frayed jacket LINUS

Two overgroomed STOCKBROKERS stand with their backs to

the young man yammering about high interest yields and
consequently they dont notice (and neither do we not at
first) that Linus is slowly picking one of their pockets

The thievery is glacier-paced Linus his face always
forward and inscrutable gingerly raises one tail of his
targets Brooks Brothers jacket and then with
incomparable dexterity unbuttons his wallet pocket with
a flick of his thumb and forefinger

From halfway down the train car nothing appears amiss
and no passenger looks the wiser Or so it seems

A copy of the Chicago Sun-Times opened and upheld
lowers just enough to allow its reader a peek at Linus
It is Danny smirk on his lips He (and he alone) is
aware of the ongoing heist

Back to Linus his spoils (a Gucci wallet) now in sight
but he waits for just the right moment and then when
the train hits another curve

he stumbles forward his left hand finding support on
the Stockbrokers shoulder as his right relieves the man
of his wallet

LINUS
Sorry â€˜bout that

No problem guy

Linus tucks his prize into his own jacket pocket face

a brief brush with one well-dressed man (the Sun-Times
tucked under his arm) he escapes the station without
incident

remains but the ticket beneath his hand is gone

DANNY
Okay Bad news first This place
houses a security system which
rivals most nuclear missile silos
First we have to get within the
casino cages --

RUSTY
(indicating)
-- here here and here --

DANNY
-- which anyone knows takes more
than a smile Next through
these doors each of which
requires a different six-digit
code changed every twelve hours
Past those lies the elevator and
this is where it gets tricky the
elevator wont move without
authorized fingerprint
identifications --

RUSTY
-- which we cant fake --

DANNY
-- and vocal confirmations from
both the security center within
the Bellagio and the vault below - -

RUSTY
-- which we wont get

DANNY
Furthermore the elevator shaft is
rigged with motion detectors --

RUSTY
-- meaning if we manually override
the lift the shafts exit will
lock down automatically and well
be trapped

Once weve gotten down the shaft
though then its a walk in the

Uzis and predilections toward not
being robbed and the most
elaborate vault door conceived by

that bilingual exchange or too numbed by the task ahead
of them to speak

You said something about good
news

DANNY

(smiles happy

someone asked)
The Nevada Gaming Commission
stipulates a casino must hold in
reserve enough cash to cover every
chip at play on its floor As I
mentioned this vault services
each of the three casinos above
it That means during the week
by law it must hold anywhere from
sixty to seventy million dollars
in cash and coin On a weekend
between eighty and ninety million
On a fight night like the one two
weeks from tonight the night
were going to rob it at least a
hundred and fifty million Without
breaking a sweat

Now there are eleven of us Each
with an equal share You do the
math

I did You know they say
cinnamon is wonderful for your
pores Read that on the internet
And that ideally you should be
wearing gloves to bed but I find
that would interfere with my

use traditional remedies

over all the eye-in-the-sky cameras hidden there She
follows his look

we make our move

Two guards wheel in a cash cart and leave it in the
vaults center and march out again closing the thick
metal door behind them When the vault LOCKS CLICK

- We STOP DESCENDING just above the cash cart There
is silence for a spell the lights flicker out then

- the false top of the cart springs open revealing Yen
within folded neatly

DANNY
What -- is a pinch

120 INT LAB â€” DAY 120

Scientists demonstrate the pinch a lithium wire in a
glass vacuum tube the size of a small refrigerator

BASHER (VO)
A pinch is the equivalent of a
cardiac arrest for any broad-band
electrical circuitry Or better
yet A pinch is a bomb but
without the bomb Every time a
nuclear weapon detonates it
unleashes an electromagnetic pulse
which shuts down any power source
within its vicinity That tends
not to matter in most cases
because the nuclear weapon
destroys everything you might need
power for anyway Now a pinch
creates a similar electromagnetic
pulse but without the headache of
mass destruction and death So
instead of Hiroshima you get the
Seventeenth Century

the wheel Benedicts goons

THE END
