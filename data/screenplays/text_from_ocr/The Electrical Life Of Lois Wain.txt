Story by

Simon Stephenson and Will Sharpe
“PROLOGUE”

EXT GRAVEYARD CATHOLIC CHURCH MARYLEBONE - DAY A WILD FOREBODING ATMOSPHERE HEAVY RAIN as we track
ominously along muddy ground LIGHTNING reflects in puddles

A STRANGE CREAKING and the SPLISH-SPLOSH of footsteps A pair
of muddy black shoes trample through the shot followed by
rickety wheels

LOUIS WAIN (19 slight moustache ill fitting funeral suit)
drags a wagon behind him overflowing with soggy fabrics

We are in a GRAVEYARD walking among headstones through a
garden of death The fabrics are delightfully coloured and
intricately patterned - a curious counterpoint to the grand
gloom of the storm LOUIS is soaking wet and has a slightly
odd gait He hums quietly to himself as LIGHTNING flashes

A SCREECHY MEOW as a GRAVEDIGGER tosses a disgruntled GINGER
CAT out of a freshly dug grave

GRAVEDIGGER
Get out of it Stupid cat

The GINGER CAT hisses as it scurries off into the bushes The
GRAVEDIGGER inspects a ravaged lunch box

GRAVEDIGGER (CONTD)
Naughty bastard’s just gobbled up
half my herrings

LOUIS chuckles to himself Other FUNERAL GUESTS gather with
umbrellas A FUNERAL CARRIAGE arrives bearing the coffin

LOUIS (VO)
On the 5th of August in the year
1860

LIGHTNING FLASHES over the horizon

INT CATHOLIC CHURCH MARYLEBONE - DAY

LIGHT FLASHES on the pale yellow face of WILLIAM MATTHEW
WAIN He is lying dead in an open casket full of flowers

LOUIS (VO)
I was born into a decade of
sickness and torment

LOUIS coughs and shuffles through scribbled wet notes - some
of it backwards written the wrong way “My father is not
dead He has merely transformed into electricity”
LOUIS’ FIVE ECCENTRIC LOOKING SISTERS (CAROLINE JOSEPHINE MARIE CLAIRE and FELICIE are
squashed together on a pew with their mother MRS WAIN

CAROLINE
Speak up Louis for goodness’
sake

JOSEPHINE

Yes speak up I completely agree

CAROLINE has an almost comically serious manner JOSEPHINE
has a dafter waftier energy A PRIEST sits confused in a
large ornate chair We notice MRS DU FRAYNE a neighbour we
will recognise later

LOUIS (VO)
Foul storms of ferocious agony
expanded time and I seemed to live
for a thousand years haunted by
mental pictures of extraordinary
complexity

The FABRICS from LOUIS’ wagon are on display around the

church dripping rain onto the floor LOUIS looks up finally
to the congregation

OPENING TITLES (C1860 - 1875)

CREDITS BEGIN over a series of MEMORIES We feel transported
into the colourful chaos of LOUIS’ young brain

YOUNG LOUIS as a boy We see his cleft lip

LOUIS (V0O)
I saw wriggling spectres in my
father’s handiwork and was a
bedevilled by a vast globe with
endless surface climbing over and
over it for eternity

YOUNG LOUIS discovers his father in a WORKSHOP WILLIAM WAIN
uses a woodblock to print patterns onto wallpaper It looks
like they are coming to life

TERRIFYING ABSTRACT VISIONS OF A VAST GLOBE SPINNING
ENDLESSLY - AN INFINITE CURVE OF DARKNESS

YOUNG LOUIS is in bed feverish His TWO BABY SISTERS watch

LOUIS (V0O)
But most fearful of all was The
Sea Full Of Big Ships

A SUDDEN CRACK OF THUNDER AND WE ARE TRANSPORTED INTO A
VISION OF A STORMY SEA SHIPS FROM HIS BEDROOM NOW LOOK HUGE
AND CREAK IN TURBULENT WATER
4A

YOUNG LOUIS runs through the house at night A LIGHTNING
STORM outside He arrives at his parents’ bedroom crying

YOUNG LOUIS
Mummy Daddy Help me I’m
drowning Help me

YOUNG LOUIS rattles the door but it is locked He looks down
the hallway In his imagination WATER FLOODS TOWARDS HIM

YOUNG LOUIS (CONTD)
Mummy Please Help me Help I’m
drowning I’m drowning

INTERCUT

EXT LONDON STREETS ST JOHN STREET CLERKENWELL

GUESTS make their way through the RAIN in a slow parade

LOUIS (VO)
My warped appearance and uncommon
behaviour saw me banned from school
and I was quite excluded from the
enviously hum-drum existence of
normal children

LOUIS walks near the front with his SISTERS MRS WAIN MRS DU
FRAYNE PATTERNS OF COLOUR START TO INVADE THE PICTURE

LOUIS (V0O)
But then at the age of nine

The WAINS usher GUESTS into their TOWNHOUSE LOUIS notices
the feral GINGER CAT cowering under cover across the street
The scruffy GINGER CAT has one eye

OPENING TITLES 4A

YOUNG LOUIS groans with pain His tongue is bright red
infected He is covered in a rash His MOTHER attends to him

LOUIS (V0O)
I suffered a violent attack of
scarlet fever which I decided to
fight For the first time in my
life I decided to fight

LOUIS is ROARING through tears like he is summoning some
deep seismic force He looks up into the camera his tear-
sodden face showing great determination and courage

LOUIS (V0O)
I forced my way into conventional
education - and there too I fought
the bullies that taunted me
YOUNG LOUIS is pushed by a group of BULLIES who are pulling
faces to mock his CLEFT LIP YOUNG LOUIS pushes them back He
is outnumbered but he fights back with all his might

QUICK CUTS OF LOUIS’ CHILDHOOD NOTEBOOKS

LOUIS (VO)
I studied chemistry mathematics
music astronomy and art and
soon discovered that school in
fact was no match for my vast
peculiar intellect

He works hard writing notes doing experiments sketching
inventions fiddling on the violin He looks through a
KALEIDOSCOPE He discovers and investigates a MAGIC LANTERN
A VICTORIAN CHROMATROPE which spins with psychedelic colours

LOUIS (VO)
I realised I could defeat the chaos
of my mind by always moving I
became brilliant I became brave

YOUNG LOUIS climbs trees and snatches eggs from nests He
paddles in streams catching beetles

He runs freely in the fields A LIGHTNING STORM cracks into
action He looks up at the electric sky

LOUIS (V0O)
I became indestructible

INTERCUT

INT PARLOUR KITCHEN WAIN TOWNHOUSE CLERKENWELL - DAY

A PORTRAIT WIDE of the WAINS and their FUNERAL GUESTS TWO
PET DOGS LOUIS sits in the centre sipping a cup of tea

LOUIS (V0O)
But forty-four years after the
death of my father sinister
electrical currents and foul ether
will infect my body and mind
irreparably I will be certified
insane and admitted into a pauper’s
ward at Springfield Psychiatric
Hospital in Tooting You probably
won’t have heard of me but my name
is Louis Wain

PATTERNS OF COLOUR OVERWHELM THE IMAGE A WASH OF DANCING
ELECTRIC HUES It’s strange It’s unsettling It’s beautiful

END OF PROLOGUE TITLES
1881 - 1887 “EARLY WAIN”

EXT TRAIN FROM ANDOVER - DAY A STEAM TRAIN clatters through the countryside A feeling of
ramshackle proactivity

INT TRAIN FROM ANDOVER - DAY

LOUIS (now 20s) looks dishevelled covered in mud and dusty
hoof prints He carries a satchel sketch pad the remains of
a smashed easel a violin case and boxing gloves

TRAIN ATTENDANT
Please keep your animals under
control

He bustles his way through a busy train full of VARIOUS FARM
ANIMALS PAMPERED DOGS even A PEACOCK - all making a ruckus
among the GENTLEMEN LADIES FARMERS and other ANIMAL OWNERS

A FEW PASSENGERS whisper as he passes We can hear snatches
“nutcase” “death-wish” “idiot”

INT CARRIAGE TRAIN FROM ANDOVER - DAY

LOUIS’ sketches from the ANDOVER COUNTRY SHOW are in a messy
pile He is crouched on the floor finishing the details of
an angry BULL which he draws at great speed from memory

MR POMERANIAN (0C)
Are you an illustrator

A MAN with a rosetted POMERANIAN is crouched nearby

LOUIS
Um yes and no I illustrate
for money but I’m also working on
several patents at the moment

LOUIS shuffles out his PORTFOLIO accomplished drawings of
BIRDS OWLS FISH BEARS PENGUINS DOGS LANDSCAPES We also
see CONFUSING SKETCHES OF COMPLICATED INVENTIONS

MR POMERANIAN
Just come from the Country Show I
take it did you get into a fight
or something

LOUIS
Oh no I was attacked by a one
and a half tonne bull
MR POMERANIAN
Ah That was you was it Yes I
heard about that How much would
you charge for a drawing of
Cleopatra

LOUIS
I I don’t really draw people

MR POMERANIAN
No Cleopatra

CLOSE-UP of the daft POMERANIAN

LOUIS
Ah Well that you can have for
free

MR POMERANIAN
That’s awfully kind my sister
normally takes her but she’s unwell
so it’s me today Thought it might
cheer her up Dan Rider by the way

LOUIS nods in acknowledgement of the name already sketching

CLEOPATRA with surprising speed MR POMERANIAN (DAN

RIDER)curiously spies the VIOLIN CASE and BOXING GLOVES

DAN RIDER
Busy day

INT JEM MACE’S BOXING GYM LONDON - DAY

SMACK WALLOP LOUIS is suddenly boxing A SKETCH of
famous boxer BENDIGO - hangs on the wall LOUIS keeps
throwing himself at a much bigger SPARRING OPPONENT

THWACK LOUIS falls onto his back and starts laughing

JEM MACE
Alright Wain that’s enough
Youll be late for your meetings

LOUIS
Let me have one last crack at him

LOUIS dizzily wobbles back to his feet jiggling about
febrile dance OTHER BOXERS both men and women enjoy

LOUIS (CONTD)
The Bendigo Shuffle Come on you
big brute Give me your best shot

THE BIG BOXER thinks about it for a second Then - THWACK

HARD CUT TO

INT INGRAM’S OFFICE ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS - DAY

LOUIS crashes into an ILN WORKER and drops a pile of his
sketches in a flurry of paper

LOUIS
Sorry Sorry

He starts picking them up and trying to pass them to SIR
WILLIAM INGRAM Editor of the ILN

INGRAM

I’ve received word about your
foolish antics at the country show
Mr Wain There’s been a whole raft
of complaints about

(consults a note)
“An odd fellow being dangerous
climbing nonchalantly into the
Longhorn’s pen and standing not
three yards from the largest most
ferocious animal on the entire
site”

INGRAM inspects LOUIS’ bull illustrations as they walk

LOUIS
I was trying to get a closer look
at him and well he didn’t have a
very good sense of humour put it
that way

INGRAM
Not renowned for their sense of
humour are they really bulls
Every time I commission you to
illustrate a story for us you
manage to create some kind of
ridiculous chaos I mean why were
you throwing peanuts at him

LOUIS
I heard somewhere that they like
peanuts and it calms them down but
it didn’t work That’s the trouble
with these show-cows Huge egos

INGRAM
It’s a good job you can draw Mr
Wain or we would have parted ways
some time ago And don’t think I
haven’t noticed the absolute state
of your visage

INGRAM arrives at his desk and inspects LOUIS’ bull
illustrations LOUIS is a bit bloody and bruised a small cut
across his nose hesitantly following into the office

LOUIS
Oh this isn’t from the bull Sir
William I’ve just had a boxing
class with Jem Mace

INGRAM
Boxing With the great Jem Mace
So when did you draw this bull

LOUIS
On the train from memory

INGRAM
All of them How fast do you
work exactly

LOUIS
Um well

LOUIS rummages for a couple of pencils SIR WILLIAM looks at
him curiously LOUIS is scribbling with TWO PENCILS AT ONCE

INGRAM
I’1l come clean with you young
Wain One of my speediest most
prolific staff illustrators has
just been poached by a rival
publication and I am in desperate
need to find a replacement Do you
think you’d be up to it

LOUIS

Well yes obviously

(off INGRAM’S look)
I hardly find this work taxing Sir
William I do it simply to pay the
bills and to support the six hungry
and precocious women that I live
with at home Until they get
married of course To be honest
it’s rather inconvenient

LOUIS finishes sketching and turns the paper round to show
SIR WILLIAM a sketch of SIR WILLIAM The expression in the
drawing is comically similar to his expression in real life

INGRAM thinks as LOUIS starts gathering his things

INGRAM
Mr Wain I don’t think you
understand me On the basis of the
speed and the quality of your work -
and with the proviso that you
modify your imbecilic behaviour - I
am offering you the position of
full time staff at the Illustrated
London News

LOUIS

Well that’s very kind of you Sir
William but I’m afraid I can’t I
have several important electrical
patents to finish and in fact I’m
rather late for a meeting with
Henry Wood the celebrated
composer

(off INGRAM’S look)
I’ve written an opera

INT HORSE-DRAWN BUS EXT LONDON STREETS - AFTERNOON
A GIANT DOG FOOD ADVERT featuring a PAMPERED-LOOKING DOG

Inside a HORSE-DRAWN BUS LOUIS leafs through his scores
humming even singing and conducting excitedly to himself

A MOTHER shields her CHILDREN from LOUIS’ peculiar presence

INT LONDON TEAROOMS MAYFAIR - AFTERNOON

LOUIS is sat in a plush tea room full of FANCY GUESTS
Brightly coloured cakes are half finished on a cake stand

HENRY WOOD
This is not an opera Louis By
conventional standard it barely
qualifies as music And this is
not a plot it’s just your
thoughts

LOUIS’ “OPERA” is out on the table WOOD smiles patiently

HENRY WOOD (CONTD)
I love your enthusiasm but you
have to master the basics of
harmony first

LOUIS
I’ve invented my own harmonies

HENRY WOOD
Yes well perhaps that’s part of
the problem if it’s any
consolation I thought the little
drawing you did on the cover sheet
was rather charming

LOUIS looks down at the colourful display of leaves and
berries surrounding A BULLFINCH

EXT WAIN TOWNHOUSE ST JOHN STREET CLERKENWELL - DUSK

A reasonably smart street clouded in evening mist We can
dimly hear a PIANO being played

NEIGHBOUR (0C)
Tell your sisters to keep it down

LOUIS ignores this as he arrives home at the TOWNHOUSE

INT HALLWAY WAIN TOWNHOUSE CLERKENWELL - DUSK

LOUIS slams the door behind him WILLIAM WAIN’S BEAUTIFUL
COLOURFUL WALLPAPER brings colour to the lamplit hallway

Immediately we feel the bustle of his SISTERS - COOKING in
the kitchen a PIANO being played CHILDREN FENCING upstairs

LOUIS starts wiping his shoes clean on a boot brush

CLAIRE (0C)
Evening Louis

LOUIS
Yes evening

FELICIE and MARIE (0C)
Evening

LOUIS
Hello yes how are you

JOSEPHINE (0C)
Are you back

LOUIS
Yes of course I’m back Josephine
I’m back What do you mean

FELICIE hurries down the stairs holding a FENCING FOIL

FELICIE
Louis did you meet an eligible
young lady of means in Hampshire

LOUIS
No but I did meet a few goats and
geese and a rather cantankerous
bull

JOSEPHINE
Well that’s no use - you can’t
marry a goat can you

FELICIE
What’s happened to your poor face
Was it boxing again

CAROLINE (0C)
Don’t tell me he’s been boxing
again

LOUIS’ path is blocked by CLAIRE CLAIRE
Did you meet the Duchess of
Westminster at the show Louis
LOUIS
I don’t know who that is
15 INT KITCHEN WAIN TOWNHOUSE CLERKENWELL - CONT

Bubbling pots pans CAROLINE (20s) chops vegetables

CAROLINE

LOUIS (0C)

16 INT PARLOUR WAIN TOWNHOUSE CLERKENWELL - CONT

A LIT FIRE JOSEPHINE is playing the piano badly
JOSEPHINE
You know who the Duchess of
Westminster is Louis she has
those eyebrows

CAROLINE
Have you been boxing

CAROLINE charges through holding a kitchen knife

17 INT HALLWAY WAIN TOWNHOUSE CLERKENWELL - CONT

LOUIS
I’ve told you Caroline He barely
charges me because I gave him a
drawing of Bendigo

CLAIRE
Louis will you practise quadrilles
with me after supper

CLAIRE dances to show us what a “quadrille” might be
CAROLINE enters the hallway holding the knife

LOUIS
Ah you’ve come to murder me at
last Felicie protect me quick

FELICIE
En garde

FELICIE jokingly holds the foil up at CAROLINE who bats it
out the way without any humour whatsoever

CAROLINE
Don’t Louis we must discuss our
finances How was your meeting with
Sir William Is he satisfied

LOUIS
Sir William is if anything overly
delighted with my work In fact he
offered me the position of staff
illustrator Now can I get to my-

LOUIS tries to push on up the stairs but FELICIE hugs him

FELICIE
Staff illustrator But that’s
fantastic Louis

LOUIS
Yes but-

CLAIRE
Bravo brother

CLAIRE reappears MARIE is now standing on the stairs
above him She also holds a FENCING FOIL in a strange
costume with cape and mask munching an APPLE

JOSEPHINE
Did I hear you say staff
illustrator

JOSEPHINE appears down in the hallway

LOUIS
Yes but I didn’t accept it

CAROLINE
-- I beg your very pardon why

LOUIS
Because I need more time to work on
my inventions and to improve my
understanding of musical notation
so I can return to Henry Wood with
the greatest opera of all time

MARIE
I’m a phantom swordsman Apples
make me invisible

LOUIS
(heading upstairs)
Yes okay Marie Well done

CAROLINE
Louis Come down here this instant

LOUIS
Where’s mother I got her a little
present from Andover

FELICIE
She’s got a sniffle She’s
snoozing

LOUIS
It’s just a silly trinket from the
country show It cost nothing

CAROLINE
Nothing costs nothing Louis We
already have twice as many
outgoings as you have wages and
weve just hired a governess

LOUIS
I told you I need that room for
secondary projects and anyway I can
teach them I’m perfectly qualified
in all the relevant subjects

CAROLINE
No you are not Louis And you need
to be out working

JOSEPHINE
Yes quite right You need to be out
working Louis

LOUIS
Governess I’m afraid we do not
require your services at present

LOUIS ignores them and continues up the stairs

18 INT FIRST FLOOR LANDING WAIN HOUSE CLERKENWELL - CONT 18

The SISTERS chase after him MRS WAIN snoozes in an armchair

LOUIS
Please excuse the misunderstanding

CAROLINE
Louis Come back here

JOSEPHINE
Yes come back here Quite right

INT TOP FLOOR LANDING WAIN TOWNHOUSE CLERKENWELL - CONT 19

LOUIS struts up to the top floor where there are three rooms -
THE SCHOOL ROOM the GUEST ROOM and LOUIS’ BEDROOM LOUIS
tries the SCHOOL ROOM first

LOUIS
Governe-ess Time to pack your ba-
ags Where are you
INT GUEST ROOM WAIN TOWNHOUSE CLERKENWELL - CONT 20

LOUIS enters the GUEST ROOM The room is a mess of teaching
materials books clothes and quite a lot of exotic FRUIT

LOUIS
Governess

No sign of anyone CAROLINE JOSEPHINE CLAIRE MARIE and
FELICIE arrive in the doorway shocked by the mess

JOSEPHINE
Where’s she gone

Inside the wardrobe we are with EMILY RICHARDSON who has
curled herself up into the dark and is peering at the WAINS
through a crack of light in the door THE SISTERS investigate
the FRUIT while LOUIS comes over to the wardrobe EMILY
breathes nervously as LOUIS peers right in at her

EMILY
(quietly to herself)
Oh for fuck’s sake

JOSEPHINE
Perhaps we should have gone with
the scary nun after all

MARIE
No not the scary nun

FELICIE
She was so smelly and boring

LOUIS
Is that you in there governess

EMILY isn’t sure what to do
CAROLINE
Miss Richardson If you are in the
wardrobe we shall be most
displeased

FELICIE CLAIRE and MARIE are finding this quite funny

LOUIS
There’s no need to be frightened
but I’m going to have to open this
door Okay One two three

LOUIS opens the door Curled up inside is EMILY RICHARDSON

EMILY
Right yes No I can see how this
is I mean as first impressions
go how do you do Mr Wain

EMILY emerges dustily from the wardrobe clutching a copy of
“THE TEMPEST” She wears reading spectacles and variously
patterned garments in blue

CAROLINE
Miss Richardson Get out of the
wardrobe

EMILY
Well I’m not in it anymore but

CAROLINE
Get out of it immediately

EMILY is not in the wardrobe anymore but CAROLINE is so
angry that she’s saying weird things

EMILY
Would you perhaps like to know my
name Mr Wain So you don’t have to
keep shouting “governess” all round
the house I believe your mother
has been napping Not very
thoughtful is it Trampling up the
stairs like a drunken elephant
shouting “governess” at the top of
your voice

CAROLINE JOSEPHINE CLAIRE MARIE and FELICIE are surprised
by how easily EMILY handles LOUIS

CAROLINE
Miss Richardson why were you in
the wardrobe And what is all this
mad fruit everywhere It’s chaos

EMILY
It helps me to concentrate
sometimes to be in a confined
space With something like
Shakespeare I know it inside out
already so I just block out the
world and play it through in my
head

LOUIS
Well that’s all very nice Miss
Richardson but I was just saying
how I am in fact well versed in
mathematics and chemistry and so

EMILY
Right well if you shan’t be needing
my services I’1l be on my way

JOSEPHINE
Miss Richardson please He’s just
being an ass

EMILY
No no I’m actually quite
relieved not to have to get up at
four-thirty in the morning to
prepare lessons

LOUIS
Four-thirty

21 INT TOP FLOOR LANDING SCHOOL ROOM - CONT
EMILY heads for the SCHOOL ROOM They follow

EMILY
And to be honest with you Mr Wain
I was a bit worried about the
Ancient Greek Homer’s use of the
metrical ictus does make it rather
hard doesn’t it And all those
feminine caesuras

LOUIS has no idea EMILY grabs a stack of books
EMILY (CONTD)
No doubt they will be much better

off in your accomplished hands

The SISTERS all look at LOUIS urging him to make her stay

22 INT GUEST ROOM WAIN TOWNHOUSE CLERKENWELL - CONT
EMILY heads back to the GUEST BEDROOM Again they follow
LOUIS
Um I I was just thinking
actually that um

EMILY
- Yes
LOUIS
I promised myself I would submit my
patent for The Steady-Cycle before
the end of the month and if I’m
teaching my sisters how to do
feminine senoras-

EMILY
Caesuras

LOUIS
- yes exactly well I may not
have time

EMILY
So you would like me to stay

LOUIS has relented

CAROLINE
Good Well that’s settled then

CLAIRE
Is this a pineapple

EMILY
Yes that’s a pineapple Quite rare
but I know the man who imports
them you see My father was a
fruiterer He passed away recently
but I thought I would bring you all
some interesting tropical gifts by
way of thanks for the employment

LOUIS
-- Our father passed away recently
too

EMILY
So I gather

JOSEPHINE
Well thank you for the gesture
Miss Richardson but I’m afraid
this is too much fruit

EMILY
Oh I’m sorry

JOSEPHINE
Yes no this is ridiculous It’s far
too much

MARIE
Can we eat them

MARIE and FELICIE are trying to peel bananas

EMILY
Of course That’s what they’re for

CAROLINE

Put the bananas down this instant
We are grateful to Miss Richardson
for her gift but we do not eat
tropical fruits in the bedroom
Bring them downstairs dinner is
in half an hour We shall serve
yours up here Miss Richardson

CAROLINE leaves followed by the SISTERS EMILY and LOUIS are
alone EMILY looks at LOUIS He looks up too

LOUIS
And what is your name Miss
Richardson
EMILY
- It’s Emily
LOUIS
Emily very good why don’t you
join us

over each other serving themselves and each other sloppily

MRS WAIN is wrapped in a quilt occasionally dabbing at her
nose with a handkerchief She is a gentle bohemian spirit

MRS WAIN
My poor husband William was thrown
out by his family in Staffordshire
They were all Protestant you see

MARIE

different things on there and pouring gravy on it

JOSEPHINE
Sage and fennel Mad I know

MARIE
Do it again Miss Richardson

EMILY
(Staffordshire accent)
Do what again This is just how I
talk

We notice some of her FRUIT in huge bowls around the side

FELICIE
(copying the accent)
Can I have a carrot and some peas

CAROLINE
Mouths closed when you’re chewing
please

LOUIS is transfixed by EMILY CAROLINE seems miffed that
EMILY is at the table MRS WAIN finishes blowing her nose

MRS WAIN
He wanted to be Catholic you
see but his father wouldn’t let
him of course so he just ran away

MARIE
He was a Cathoholic

EMILY
And how did you meet him

EMILY gives a small glance in LOUIS’ direction

MRS WAIN
Through the church I designed
tapestries for the church and he
came from a silk family so he
was a draper And my own father -
I’m French you see

MRS WAIN does a joking “lah-dee-dah” pose EMILY laughs
LOUIS can’t take his eyes off her

MRS WAIN (CONTD)
he smuggled himself over to
England by disguising himself as a

woman
EMILY
No
JOSEPHINE
True story
MRS WAIN

Were a family of mischief-makers
you see Miss Richardson We might
as well be called the Shenanigans
I dare say you’ll have your hands
full with these three And as for
you two - high time you found some
nice husbands of your own don’t
you think

CAROLINE
We will mother in time

MRS WAIN
But when in time Caroline You
never leave the house

JOSEPHINE
I was given quite the look by a
hatted man with a huge moustache
the other day On the bus
Absolutely enormous moustache he
had and a very prominent brow very
prominent Like a dome Quite the
look honestly it was embarrassing

MRS WAIN
But did he seem wealthy Josephine

JOSEPHINE
Oh yes very I could tell he had
money just from the smell of him

CLAIRE
You love him

FELICIE
Josephine’s going to marry a man
with a giant moustache

EMILY looks back at LOUIS again She smiles at him Only
CAROLINE senses this connection

EMILY
Miss Caroline

CAROLINE
- Is everything to your
satisfaction Miss Richardson

EMILY
Very much so why do you ask

CAROLINE

Oh no just

because I was going

to say if the room is not to your
liking I would be perfectly happy
for you to swap with me

EMILY
- That won’t be necessary I’m
very comfortable

CAROLINE
Of course Only I wouldn’t
want you to feel Ill at ease
sharing a floor with A man
EMILY

Why would that make me feel ill

at ease

CAROLINE decides not to push it and smiles at her oddly

CAROLINE
Very good Please keep your
belongings in order You are here
to set an example to my sisters

EMILY
Of course You’re very good with

them by the
exhausting

up

way Must be

Why are you holding a rock

EMILY
Oh I travel a lot asa
Governess so I carry a few rocks

with me from Shrewsbury where I
grew up Helps me to feel at home
Funny I hated it as a little girl

pops his head round and sees CAROLINE and JOSEPHINE trying to
shoo the CATS out with a BROOM and a SHOVEL or similar

CAROLINE
Go on shoo

JOSEPHINE
Yes come on pussies Out you go

FELICIE
But why can’t we keep them People
keep dogs as pets all the time

CLAIRE
Because they’re cats Felicie If
we start keeping cats as pets our
neighbours will think us quite the
barmiest family on the street

LOUIS heads off out the door
JOSEPHINE (0C)

We need to pincer them like sheep-
bitches

INT LOUIS BEDROOM WAIN TOWNHOUSE CLERKENWELL - MORN 29
EMILY mischievously drifts out of her bedroom and into

LOUIS’ She looks at the WALLPAPER his impressive SKETCHES
his beautiful PAINTINGS the strange ELECTRICAL PATENTS

She picks out some UNDERWEAR and holds it up amusing

herself She chucks it back

EXT LONDON STREET NEAR WAIN TOWNHOUSE LONDON - MORN 30

LOUIS walks through relatively quiet streets with purpose

INT LOUIS BEDROOM WAIN TOWNHOUSE CLERKENWELL - MORN 31

EMILY looks under his bed and finds some DOLLS from when he
was a child She investigates them then puts them back

Finally she looks in the drawers of his desk and finds a
battered journal She looks around to make sure nobody is
looking then opens it up

INT LOUIS BEDROOM WAIN TOWNHOUSE CLERKENWELL - MORNING 33

EMILY starts to get a sense of the turmoil that perhaps lies
beneath LOUIS’ seemingly playful exterior

Then she notices MRS DU FRAYNE staring at her from a WINDOW
across the way She smiles oddly before disappearing into her
house EMILY doesn’t recognise her and is a bit perplexed

She looks back down at the images in LOUIS’ JOURNAL

LOUIS spots SIR WILLIAM INGRAM wearing a pince-nez breast-
stroking slowly in the pool He sets down his things and
dives in to catch up with him Like his boxing LOUIS’
swimming is frenetic and jerky

LOUIS
- Good morning Sir William

INGRAM
Good morning Mr Wain Don’t often
see you in here at this time

LOUIS
Well I’ve come to see you sir
Have you got a moment

INGRAM
Of course Louis just let me
finish my morning exercise

LOUIS
Yes of course

goes This attracts the attention of the OTHER BATHERS

INGRAM (CONTD)
Why the sudden change of heart

LOUIS
Oh um well we’ve hired a
Governess for my youngest sisters

INGRAM
And you don’t want her dashing
off to some other family because
you can’t afford to pay her

LOUIS
Something like that yes

INGRAM

Well you will start on poverty
wages of course as is standard
but it will be regular And I’m
afraid I can’t at this moment offer
you holidays or expenses due to new
company policy Will that be to
your satisfaction young Mr Wain

LOUIS smiles no intention of haggling whatsoever INGRAM
seems a little surprised to be getting away with this

haven’t seen you for three weeks

WOODVILLE JR
Youve been spending too much time
with those weird sisters of yours

PRAGA
You are staff illustrator for the
top newspaper in London and a
handsome young fellow All you need
now is the loving touch of a well
bosomed aristocrat

WOODVILLE JR

That’s the thing about Phil May
the saucy fiend - always hosting a
skulk of wealthy young vixens

Out in the yard PHIL MAY is entertaining FEMALE GUESTS by
lighting a BRAZIER

PRAGA
You shall be marrying a noblewoman
within the year - I guarantee it

RAILTON

What do you say Louis We can’t
celebrate your success without you

EMILY
Because What do you mean why

LOUIS
Oh sorry Yes Sorry

LOUIS turns to face a wall EMILY has angled a mirror and
been trying to paint herself next to a vase of flowers her
dressing gown slung semi-suggestively off her shoulders

IT’S A TERRIBLE PAINTING

EMILY
Mr Wain what are you doing

LOUIS
Sorry I don’t- What do you want me
to-

EMILY
Get out

LOUIS
Right sorry yes I I
apologise I’m so sorry

Flecks of colourful paint are all over EMILY’S hands even
her face somehow

INT TOP FLOOR LANDING EMILY’S BEDROOM - CONT

EMILY
I am under your employ Mr Wain
but I do not expect to have to
tolerate you barging in here after-
hours smelling of booze when I
am well it doesn’t matter what I
was doing does it

LOUIS
I know I’m so sorry It’s just
I have so many sisters I forget
sometimes that it’s were you
painting something

EMILY
That’s none of your business Mr
Wain

EMILY looks at her slightly embarrassing attempt

EMILY (CONTD)
But yes if you must know I
have a drawing lesson with the
girls tomorrow and you Wains are
all such accomplished artists I
rather felt that I could do with a
bit more preparation that’s all

LOUIS
I see well I was actually
wondering if you would like to go
to the theatre Miss Richardson

LOUIS slips the poster for “THE TEMPEST” under the door
EMILY was not expecting this She picks it up

LOUIS (CONTD)
As an educational trip of course
with Felicie Claire and Marie

EMILY
Oh of course Yes

LOUIS
I know Shakespeare is an important
part of your teaching

EMILY
Very important yes Perhaps the
most important

LOUIS

I’m so sorry again Miss
Richardson I’m terribly
embarrassed I was just excited to
share the idea with you I don’t
want you to feel like you have to
be cooped up here in the house all
the time

A pause EMILY appreciates this She opens the door

EMILY
- I think that would be a rather
splendid idea Please just knock
next time you wish to see me

LOUIS
Absolutely Of course

They look at each other for a bit Then LOUIS glances at the
TERRIBLE PAINTING in the corner He smirks a little bit
EMILY of course can see the funny side too

EMILY
- Is something funny Mr Wain

LOUIS
Not at all not at all good
night Emily

EMILY
Good night Mr Wain

EMILY closes the door on LOUIS leaving him in the semi-dark
On LOUIS - that feeling again even stronger now

LOUIS (CONTD)
I hereby atone for my drunken
imposition by revealing myself
to you naked

LOUIS is not

EMILY
Please don’t reveal yourself to me
naked Mr Wain I might well
consider that to be a secondary
imposition arguably even greater
than the first

LOUIS
But you cannot have failed to
notice that I have quite a

profound hare lip

EMILY
Yes and what of it Mr Wain

LOUIS
Have I made a mistake

EMILY
No Mr Wain I think you look
very handsome Once you get to
know me better you’ll see that I’m
a bit like a big blue goldfish I
forget almost everything

immediately
LOUIS
So am I forgiven
EMILY

Why do you need me to forgive you
Mr Wain Just don’t do it again

Right Yes Well I’m sorry

JOSEPHINE
I’m just saying I should like to
go - not so much for the play as
for the handsome young bachelors in

before scuttling off into another bedroom

at the grand theatre

LOUIS spots MISS DU FRAYNE and a couple of her FEMALE
FRIENDS filing to their seats in a booth They see EMILY and
quickly look away whispering to each other

It feels like everyone is staring at them and whispering
They try to block it out and enjoy the moment - sweetly
innocently on edge to be here together

Thank you so do you

Yes no sorry I I was just
worried that you might be in
distress about something

LOUIS
Um no just a bit of a funny
turn that’s all

EMILY
Right yes I just thought that
it might have um might have
reminded you of something
something you found frightening as
a child perhaps like The Sea
Full of Big Ships

LOUIS is surprised that she knows about this

EMILY (CONTD)
I might have accidentally looked
in your journal

LOUIS
Well that’s nosy

EMILY
I’m afraid it’s one of my many
flaws

LOUIS
Nosiness

EMILY
Yes I’m very nosy that’s partly
why I chose to be a governess

LOUIS
And did you find it horrifying All
those dark disturbing visions

EMILY
I found it quite reassuring to be
honest I tend to have nightmares
about not getting out of places
Once spent an entire dream stuck in
a very complicated barn

LOUIS finds this gently amusing They are now quite close

LOUIS
- Well thank god you didn’t get
stuck in that wardrobe

EMILY
Thank god Thank god I had
you to let me out

LOUIS and EMILY find themselves looking straight into each
others’ eyes EMILY kisses LOUIS It’s impulsive tentative
at first Then they continue kissing with more confidence

They look around but can’t see anything

LOUIS
Strange

MEOW EMILY edges out under the umbrellas with LOUIS

EMILY
Where’s it coming from

And then they see him MEOW

Under a bush in the pouring rain they see an adorable
little BLACK and WHITE KITTEN He is vulnerable and shivering
and looking right at them

LOUIS
Hello there little one

LOUIS and EMILY carefully walk across the garden towards him

In a flash of THUNDER we see A PORTRAIT SHOT of the KITTEN
A classic LOUIS WAIN image MEOW

EMILY
Oh Louis look

EMILY picks the KITTEN up and starts hugging him and nuzzling
him - an image that will be seared into LOUIS’ memory
forever an image of innocence and love

EMILY (CONTD)

You’re soaking wet poor thing

Come into the warm with us We’1l

take care of you Won’t we Louis
EMILY heads back into the house LOUIS is left in the rain
feeling a strange solace a sense of the comfort that this
cat will bring them

EXT BOXING TENT LONDON - DAY 100

TWO FIGHTERS do battle - the huge JOURNEYMAN and the
sprightly BENDIGO who has a weird cheeky charisma bouncing
about and making up insulting rhymes to put off his opponent

LOUIS
Go on Bendigo

RAILTON
Curious little fellow isn’t he

BENDIGO is doing a dance - like LOUIS’ own eccentric boxing
dance - pulling silly faces at the JOURNEYMAN FLASH
PHOTOGRAPHERS huddle to take shots LOUIS and RAILTON sit
ringside LOUIS is trying to draw BENDIGO

LOUIS
But he’s electric Herb Look how
his fancy all adore him - Half his
opponent’s size but he knows how to
harness the electricity of the
crowd look see There it is

FLASH POW WAPOW FLASH FLASH

RAILTON
Are you talking about the
photographers

LOUIS
No Herb Look properly The
electricity Finally I feel like
I’m starting to understand it In
fact I have a hypothesis that
electricity is what pushes us
through time And if I can find a
way to conduct and divert
electricity with more accuracy I
could in theory experience the
past as if it were no different to
the future

RAILTON
Louis Is everything alright at
home With Emily I mean

LOUIS
Of course it is She’s teaching
herself Chinese so she can read
about their history in their own
language And we have a new friend
called Peter

RAILTON
Peter
LOUIS
Yes he’s a cat We have a cat now
RAILTON
For mousing you mean
LOUIS
No Herb As a pet
RAILTON
- I’m worried about you Louis
LOUIS
Why
RAILTON

Well that’s a bit disgusting
don’t you think

BENDIGO is closing in on the JOURNEYMAN nimbly ducking the
sweeping punches coming his way

LOUIS
- Do you know the true meaning of
the phrase “there’s no time like
the present” Herb It’s that there
isn’t It’s too minimal too
fleeting We turn the past into the
future - that’s what the present is
- through the power of our
electricity And that is an
entirely reversible process
Remembering things in the past is
no different to imagining things in
the future and neither is any
different to life itself I can
remember Emily in the future and
she will be there Do you see what
I’m saying Herb

BANG The JOURNEYMAN falls REFEREE holds BENDIGO’S arm up
CAMERAS FLASH BENDIGO starts dancing again geeing up the
crowd FLASHES SPARK WILDLY AS LOUIS’ WATCHES WIDE-EYED

RAILTON is not feeling it in quite the same way

INT HOTEL DINING ROOM THE STRAND - DAY 101

INGRAM is eating a rich meal LOUIS’ SKETCHES of BENDIGO and
the fight are on the table LOUIS looks at a PHOTOGRAPH of
BENDIGO’S KNOCKOUT PUNCH

LOUIS
But this doesn’t capture the spirit
of the fight Sir William

INGRAM
Um Yes it does That’s why it’s
in vogue It’s fast it’s cheap and
it’s one hundred percent accurate

LOUIS
But where is the electricity

INGRAM looks confused He wipes his mouth and looks at LOUIS

INGRAM
I hear your wife is very sick

LOUIS didn’t realise INGRAM knew this

INGRAM (CONTD)
- Did you know Louis that I
lost my father and my brother ina
shipping accident in Lake
Michigan it’s how I came to
inherit this newspaper though I
was thirteen at the time that
they died I know that you are
still supporting your mother and
your sisters Louis and that is
admirable So I’m sorry to say
this but it may be that I cannot
use you as much as I would like
for the time being I need to get
our finances in order and that
means making difficult practical
decisions but my advice to you
would be to spend the time that you
gain with your wife because
when she is gone Louis it will
hurt

LOUIS is surprised to see that INGRAM is close to tears

INGRAM (CONTD)
These are precious weeks do you

understand

LIFE SKETCHES OF PETER - PETER playing at home PETER in the

EMILY (CONTD)
When did you do all this
has Sir William seen these

LOUIS
These are not for Sir William
Emily These are for you

EMILY

- But you must show him Louis
LOUIS

Why Sir William doesn’t

care about Peter now does he
EMILY though sick looks at LOUIS with beguiling confidence

LOUIS (CONTD)
And besides I should be I should
be spending more time with you
when you’re still-

EMILY
(half playfully now)
Who is this sopping wet dishrag I
seem to have married I’m the one
who’s ill Louis Don’t you start
wallowing in it too

exterior LOUIS can see that EMILY is still full of life

I’m sorry if weve wasted your
time Sir William

INGRAM
-- I have two pages earmarked for
the Christmas edition especially
reserved for a bit of festive
frivolity something to raise the
spirits of our readers I want
you to fill it with cats

LOUIS
With cats

INGRAM
Yes with cats

LOUIS

- Do you not think that perhaps
a spread of silly dogs might be
more appealing for your readership

INGRAM
Ive seen dogs before and I
think you capture something of the
cat Louis perhaps because you
yourself are a bit of a renegade
An outcast dare I say it

INGRAM looks at him with huge kindness LOUIS is touched

INGRAM (CONTD)
How you have managed to conjure
images of such delight at such a
dark time I don’t know

LOUIS sees EMILY through the window her back to him
LOUIS
It’s because I am

indestructible

festive children running around

his double page spread “A KITTENS’ CHRISTMAS PARTY”

Further down the street FIVE STREET URCHIN BOYS and GIRLS
huddle round a discarded newspaper They are filthy and cold
but they giggle at LOUIS’ CATS forgetting their troubles
They feed A STRAY CAT some scraps of bread even stroke it

This lifts LOUIS’ spirits but not enough He pays for a copy
of the “ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS” and walks home

EMILY (VO)

Throughout history cats have been
worshipped as mystical gods and
maligned as the evil allies of
witchery and sin

dinner to the side EMILY visibly in her last days

PETER has an adorable Christmas ribbon on and is jumping into
an empty present box as if it’s a serious game

EMILY
- But I think you are the first
person ever to see that they are
in fact ridiculous That they are
silly and cuddly and lonely and
frightened and brave like us
(MORE)

EMILY (CONTD)
One day I think it won’t seem so
peculiar to have a cat in the
house as a little pet

LOUIS seems quiet

EMILY (CONTD)
- What’s going on in that funny
little head of yours

LOUIS
Sometimes I think of how you
will one day be gone and I have
to tell you Emily that I find
it intolerably difficult to
imagine I will be so very alone

EMILY
Youll be alright Louis
You’1ll have Peter

LOUIS
This time with you Emily playing
with Peter in the evenings and
sitting by the fire these have
been the best days of my entire
life I can’t tell you why it is
that I have such difficulty
just being here on this Earth
but I can say with absolute
certainty that you have made it
much much better You make the
world beautiful And warm And
kind And I just wanted to thank
you for that before it’s too late

EMILY
I haven’t made the world
beautiful Louis The world is
beautiful and you have helped me
to see that too

The sadness returns to LOUIS momentarily

EMILY (CONTD)

Just remember that however
hard things get however much you
feel that you are struggling the
world is full of beauty and it’s
up to you to capture it Louis
to look and to share it with as
many people as you can

We sense that LOUIS will never forget these words

You are a prism through which that
beam of life refracts

Nobody wants to marry us Louis

LOUIS
I didn’t copyright the images

CAROLINE
Oh my Lord help us please

CLAIRE
- What does that mean

JOSEPHINE
It means people have been re-
printing his pictures all over the
country and he hasn’t seen a
penny which explains why he is
living - not like a pauper but
actually Louis I would say you
are living rather like a pig The
stench is quite unbearable

LOUIS
Some of my originals I exchanged in
place of money so they have rather
become a currency in themselves
Haven’t they Peter

PETER meows as he passes through LEO is coughing up a fur
ball making horrible noises

LOUIS (CONTD)
I gave the barber a handful of my
Dancing Cats and now I get free
haircuts for the rest of my life
And look at this snazzy pair of
Chelseas bought the same way

LOUIS is wearing decent BOOTS This is driving CAROLINE mad

CLAIRE
But why didn’t you copyright them

LOUIS
Because I am not interested in
making money

CAROLINE
What are you interested in then
The attention The adulation “Oh
the marvelous Louis Wain who paints
one thing and it’s cats”
(rattling the table)
What are you interested in

This frightens one or two of the CATS LOUIS heads into the
parlour ushering the CATS away from raging CAROLINE

CLAIRE

Stop shouting Caroline

MINNA trots in with a DEAD BIRD
JOSEPHINE

Agh for goodness’ sake there’s a
cadaver now It’s eating a hawk

CLAIRE
It’s not a hawk Josephine
CAROLINE
You are not a child Louis you
are a man You are a man Can

you not see how you have tainted us
with your actions

CAROLINE is getting upset

CAROLINE (CONTD)
Our parents worked hard to build
our reputation and to gather a
fortune for their children and you
have squandered it all on wretched
cats and a wilful tainted doomed
romance You have destroyed this
family with your selfishness and
you continue with your childish
delusions which conspire to keep us
all in penury The indignity we
have suffered at your hands

LOUIS
I didn’t do it on purpose

CAROLINE
You didn’t what You didn’t get
married on purpose

LOUIS is hovering somewhere odd whispering into a corner

CAROLINE (CONTD)
Speak up Louis

LOUIS
I DIDN’T THINK TO DO IT

Silence PETER is looking at him LOUIS feels ashamed for his
outburst CAROLINE is now crying uncontrollably

LOUIS (CONTD)
Nobody told me I was supposed to
copyright the images

JOSEPHINE
- But what about Sir William He
should have advised you

LOUIS
I haven’t seen Sir William for a
while I have been working for
other people

CLAIRE
- We have no money Louis We
can’t eat We can’t buy clothes
Were freezing to death

CLAIRE stops There is more to say but clearly it’s delicate

Get back Get back I said He’1l
catch it

LOUIS
Catch what Marie what are you
talking about

LOUIS keeps his distance shocked and saddened to see the
state of MARIE (20s) Her hair is a wild mess

MARIE
I’ve got leprosy Can’t you see it

FELICIE
She scrubs herself red raw Louis
We can’t stop her

MARIE
Don’t talk about me as if I’m not
here

She is covered in red rashes and sores She scratches and
rubs herself compulsively Her clothes are all torn

LOUIS
Why do you keep scrubbing yourself

MARIE
Because of the leprosy I can feel
the prickles and they’re in my
head They hate me Louis They’re
plotting They’re going to murder
me

FELICIE is with LOUIS The other SISTERS and MRS WAIN sit
quietly in the dining room

FELICIE
We’re not going to murder you
Marie

MARIE

Liar And I seen murders as well -
in the alleys by the baker’s house
They’re going to throw me out
because I had relations I had
relations in the graveyard and I
bled all over him and we laughed -
they’re just jealous

because he had a big dinger and I
touched it Louis I saw heaven
that’s how I got the leprosy for
punishment They’re all spinsters
They say it’s your fault because of
Miss Richardson but it’s because
they’re ugly and foul tempered and
they lie and plot and scheme

LOUIS

I tell you what Marie Would you
like to come to my house and play
with my cats for a few days-

MARIE
No not cats they’re poisonous
They’ve got diseases and I’ve
already got leprosy

(moaning upsettingly)

I’ve got leprosy get it
off get it off me Louis Get it

FELICIE runs in to try to calm MARIE down MARIE resists her
LOUIS watches out of his depth MRS WAIN and the OTHER

He finishes a creamy cake and licks his fingers He downs
some sherry Then he studies LOUIS

INGRAM
I think you should move back in
with your family

LOUIS
But they threw me out Sir William

INGRAM
But they are your family

INGRAM lights a cigar

INGRAM (CONTD)
I have a series of properties in
the village of Westgate-On-Sea -
mansions I hire out to families and
holiday-makers in the summer They
are very habitable and in good
condition I will do my best to
find you more work Louis so you
can pay off your debts and you are
welcome to stay there for as long
as you like on a reduced rate on
one condition - that you take your
family with you

LOUIS
But Sir William I I couldn’t
possibly Especially after I have
been so callously unloyal-

INGRAM
I have plenty of other illustrators
on my books Louis Don’t flatter
yourself

LOUIS
But why Sir William

SIR WILLIAM looks sad unwell but his energy is warm

INGRAM
Because Mr Wain in spite of your
rather irregular temperament and
niggling peculiar foibles - in this
occasionally bleak world you have
shown a resilience which I
admire

(MORE)

INGRAM (CONTD)
and you have if you must know
brought me rather a lot of good
cheer through your pictures

LOUIS
Of cats

INGRAM

But they’re not just cats are
they you’re a brave soul Mr
Wain but you can’t do this all on
your own the sea air will do you
all the world of good especially
young Marie Sounds to me like she
just needs of a change of scene
Fresh clothes Proper food Brisk
walks

LOUIS looks over to a framed PICTURE of a FUNNY CAT that
looks a lot like SIR WILLIAM then to INGRAM himself

LOUIS
Thank you Sir William

things into cases

DR ELPHICK tries to retain authority The SISTERS stand by
cautiously

DR ELPHICK
Mr Wain are you aware of the
reason I have been summoned

LOUIS
I assume it’s to inform us of how
Marie is doing at the asylum Dr
Elphick That or to conduct a study
on the neural evolution of my cats

LOUIS sweeps out into the hallway

LOUIS
Yes A full body suit made of silk
copper and steel which is attached
to a large mechanical motor

DR ELPHICK
No Mr Wain

LOUIS
Shame I would say there is quite
a high chance it could cure Marie
entirely of her sickness

DR ELPHICK
You might say that but thankfully
you are not a doctor

INT DINING ROOM BENDIGO LODGE WESTGATE-ON-SEA - DAY

DR ELPHICK is sitting with LOUIS CAROLINE JOSEPHINE
CLAIRE FELICIE and now MRS WAIN too LOUIS is packed and
ready to go wearing a hat As usual there is tea

DR ELPHICK
I have been called here Mr Wain
because your sister Caroline is
concerned for your health

LOUIS
My health Why would she be
concerned about my health

FELICIE
It is not just Caroline who is
concerned Louis

JOSEPHINE
Yes quite right

DR ELPHICK
-- I understand that you are
planning a trip Mr Wain

LOUIS
Indeed I have sent colourful
missives to several publications
containing examples of my charming
prosaics and singular pictorial
work - including some new more
electrically influenced samplings
I am happy to say that the great
William Hearst of the New York
American has offered me a full time
post as their cartoonist at a
considerable fee

CLAIRE
But why do you need to go all the
way too New York It’s too far

LOUIS
Because as you are all so keen to
remind me we are rather lacking in
funds at the minute and - for a
variety of reasons that we are all
very well acquainted with - my work
is currently of little financial
value on these shores What’s more
the American people are lightyears
behind in their attitude towards
cats I assume you have been
reading about Roosevelt and his
Gentlemen’s Agreement with the
people of Japan

A small nod from DR ELPHICK

LOUIS (CONTD)
Japanese children will now be
taught in the same schools as their
American compatriots and their
immigrant parents can roam freely
in the streets of America but
can their cats

The SISTERS are curling up with embarrassment DR ELPHICK
stays calm but impatient
LOUIS (CONTD)
I have helped this country to make
great steps in that regard Now I
must help the cats of America For
better or worse Doctor Elphick I
am an artist and a prism and a
transformative funnel for negative
electricity In these tumultuous
times I want to make the people of
America smile I have never seen
an American smile in my life

CAROLINE
You have never seen an American

LOUIS
Well it’s time to change that The
only reason my sister has called
you here is because she has been
deeply jealous of my talents since
I was twelve years old and will do
anything to prevent me from
reaching my full potential

DR ELPHICK looks at the SISTERS and then at LOUIS

Out on LOUIS

INT HACKNEY

CAROLINE and

DR ELPHICK
Mr Wain there is no question
that you are delusional But mere
delusions of grandeur are not
sufficient reason to commit you to
hospital I would quite strongly
advise against your trip to New
York and suggest that you stay here
to rest and to gain a little bit of
perspective before you proceed to
the next chapter of your life But
ultimately the choice is yours And
if you do choose to ignore
absolutely everyone and proceed
with your voyage then I
recommend that you sample these two
things during your stay in America -
hot dogs and humility

stubborn refusing to be vulnerable

LOUIS
Well every cat-fancier knows that
puss likes nothing more than to sit
on a brown piece of paper

MAX
(finding it hilarious)
A brown piece of paper Oh stop

LOUIS
But this is because cats are
acutely aware of the dangers of
electrical rheumatism And of
course should you ever have cause
to punish a cat just rustle the
paper to make the sound of thunder

ALICIA
Do cats get rheumatism

LOUIS
Of course Miss Simmonds

VERONIKA
What was that Oh hey I forgot
to give you my business card

VERONIKA starts to fumble in her breast pocket then pulls
out two fingers in a “V” sign

VERONIKA (CONTD)
Fuck you You like that I
invented that

VERONIKA heads off down the aisle LOUIS follows ALICIA
looks up as he leaves but decides to let him go

LOUIS

Excuse me Madam
VERONIKA

What what do you want
LOUIS

- I’m sorry but did I

overhear you saying that you are
working on the invention of a
new kind of lamp

VERONIKA
Uh yeah Yeah sure it’s
exciting stuff I gotta tell ya

LOUIS
And it- it involves electricity

VERONIKA
Absolutely - but listen I’ma
physicist okay I know electricity
and this is like this is
revolutionary you know it’s not
just any old regular electric
lamp it’s going to be more

efficient It’s going to be it’s
going to be safer Because - ha by
god - you know how dangerous

electricity can be
LOUIS eyes widen Nobody has ever acknowledged this before

LOUIS
Yes I- I do

VERONIKA is a little thrown by his intensity
LOUIS (CONTD)

And so I’m in rather a lot of
debt you see

VERONIKA
Okay okay well listen why
don’t you take a seat I’1ll talk
you through it Give me a second

VERONIKA is rummaging in her breast pocket again

LOUIS

VERONIKA
No I actually do have a business
card somewhere here we go
Veronika Veronika E Voltzmann

VERONIKA hands LOUIS a crumpled bent up BUSINESS CARD

LOUIS
What does the ”“E” stand for

VERONIKA
Oh nothing It just sounded good

ALICIA peers back at LOUIS a bit concerned VERONIKA sits
down and opens her messy briefcase

VERONIKA (CONTD)

you need to pay off your
debts and I’1ll1 tell you how much
you need to pay in

196 INT BACKSTAGE COLISEUM ANNEXE CHICAGO - EVENING

LOUIS is unpacking getting ready for the lecture finding
easels and other props among the clutter ALICIA watches

ALICIA
Hey Mr Wain I was thinking
maybe after the show we could go
get some food

LOUIS
- Perhaps yes

ALICIA
I wouldn’t worry about Max For
what it’s worth I think you’re
doing a great job

ALICIA goes over to LOUIS

ALICIA (CONTD)

Maybe we should get a few drinks
after dinner too What do you say
Let our hair down a little bit

When she is close LOUIS stops what he is doing ALICIA takes
LOUIS’ hands TENSE SOUNDS BUILD LOUIS stares at ALICIA

LOUIS STARTS TO REMEMBER EMILY AT DINNER IN THE CLERKENWELL
TOWNHOUSE BUT HE SEES ALICIA IN EMILY’S PLACE ALICIA IS
LAUGHING TALKING WITH HIS SISTERS

LOUIS snaps out of it and looks at ALICIA breaking away

LOUIS
No Miss Simmonds I- I can’t
It would be I can never marry

again Miss Simmonds I couldn’t do
that to Emily I just couldn’t
I’m sorry I just I’m sorry

ALICIA

Mr Wain I can’t imagine what it
must have been like to lose your
wife but I just thought you seemed
a little stressed out I wanted to
cheer you up that’s all I’m not
asking you to marry me Mr Wain
I’m asking if you want to dance

LOUIS feels bad for misunderstanding but still he can’t

LOUIS (V0O)
Her whispers come in the leafy
tickle of the wind or the wet
crackle of electric rain

INT COLISEUM ANNEXE CHICAGO - EVENING 197

LOUIS is on a big stage in a classy auditorium - awkwardly
talking into a microphone which CRACKLES AND FEEDS BACK

LOUIS
Every night I turn the dial of the
wireless hoping to catch her clues
in the atmospheric electricity that
comes from the afterlife - how to
continue on this crusade

The CROWD is confused Many of them have CATS on their knees

They whisper to each other ALICIA looks concerned

A LARGE BANNER READS “CHICAGO AMERICAN CAT FANCY WELCOMES
LOUIS WAIN” The stage is a CHAOS of CAT DRAWINGS - some of
them starting to show EARLY SIGNS OF HIS ELECTRIC SHOCK CATS

AND SHIMMERING CATS - and SKETCHES ABOUT ELECTRICITY

LOUIS (CONTD)
For it was Emily who taught me the
true nature of cats the true
value of cats And it is only
through my understanding of cats
of how they are misunderstood and
mistreated for no reason other than
simple blind prejudice that I
came to understand human
beings how we are all corrupted
by a foul form of electricity -
which makes us cruel and selfish
And it is only through the work of
those who have the transformative
gift that we will come to defeat
it without change we are a
fallen species with no future An
animal whose only instinct is to
destroy

LOUIS looks up and with a LOUD CLUNK THE SOUNDS ALL STOP

The ENTIRE CROWD are now HUMAN-SIZED CATS some with CATS on
their laps - ALL STARING BACK WITH WIDE EYES AN UNSETTLING

FEELING OF SHIMMERING ELECTRICITY

away”

LATER - LOUIS is on the phone He has VERONIKA’S crumpled

ABSTRACT THIS IS AN EXTRACT OF HIS ACTUAL WRITING

THE ORNATE PATTERNS KEEP EVOLVING WE BEGIN TO SEE CATS’
FACES IN THE SHAPES OF LIGHT A FEELING OF TRANSCENDENCE

LOUIS (V0O)

I am the origin of nothing I came
to the world to try to be the whole
of the creation - I was told the
world went round - I was told the
world went to sleep - I awoke to
the truth I was nothing Nothing
goes round Saw not went not came
not The Origin was lost to the
world’s light I came and unable it
had no chance to give It slept the
sleep that nothing could awaken
The Sleep compels the opening of an
eye The eye was not there It was
at rest It would not open out as
it was nothing The slumber rested
it was gone abroad The abroad was
nowhere The rest was at an end
The miraculous was the result
Something went to find the opening
for nothing came to life Life was
then absent Nothing held sway the
end being the never condition it
went on to nothing The end ended
This gave the end no chance to
finish It was nothing The light of
God was to finish the evil of all
the evils of nothing The evils of
nothing dies The evils of nothing
can only once more come the
miraculous was the result

INT CORRIDOR PAUPERS’ WARD SPRINGFIELD - DAY 227

LOUIS WAIN is an old man - thin grey-white hair a beard
His hands are covered in paint His clothes are threadbare
The soles of his shoes are peeling off

He is painting the PSYCHEDELIC CAT PATTERNS we have just seen
in the sequence before PAINTINGS IN THIS STYLE are displayed
all around the room

The DOOR is open and we can hear talking in the corridor The
Hospital Director DR COOKE is talking with DANIEL JAMES
RIDER whose voice we might recognise

DR COOKE
And this is what we call the
paupers’ ward for um for

obvious reasons But I assure you
the patients are looked after in a
perfectly professional manner I
hope you will report favourably
back to the er committee that
you volunteer for

DAN RIDER
I am here to assess the welfare of
your patients Mr Cook Not just on
behalf of my fellow committee
members but on behalf of the
government So I shall report back
according to what I find

DR COOKE
- Indeed

DAN RIDER
So what is the average length of
stay here at Springfield Have you
had much success with turning
patients out

DR COOKE and DAN RIDER arrive at LOUIS’ cell DR COOKE acts
as if LOUIS’ not there But RIDER is immediately struck He
recognises LOUIS from the train at the start of the film

DR COOKE
We have had a few successes but it
depends partly on the patient’s
willingness to co-operate with the
treatment

We recognise him too - the man with the POMERANIAN who was
later working in the book shop now significantly older

DR COOKE (CONTD)
Which - as you can imagine Mr
Rider - does vary hugely from
person to person

DAN RIDER
Louis Wain

LOUIS looks up from his painting DR COOKE stops talking

DR COOKE

- Yes this is Mister Louis
Wain you might remember his
rather charming cat pictures
from all those years ago

DAN RIDER
How are you Mr Wain

LOUIS frowns slightly This man does look familiar

DAN RIDER (CONTD)

Dan Rider We met on the train back
from Andover I had my sister’s
Pomeranian Cleopatra

LOUIS face lights up a bit He remembers it now

LOUIS
Cleopatra

DAN RIDER
I had no idea you were a patient
here Mr Wain

DR COOKE
He is I’m afraid quite insane
we do our best to help him

RIDER enters the room and is looking at the paintings

DR COOKE (CONTD)
Very sad isn’t it Mr Rider he
seems almost entirely to have lost
a handle on his craft

DAN RIDER finds the pictures extraordinary He finds this
whole situation extraordinary He thinks for a moment

DAN RIDER
Dr Cooke would you give me some
time alone with Mr Wain

DR COOKE
Visiting hours I’m afraid are

DAN RIDER
As part of my assessment

DR COOKE
- Yes Of course

228 EXT YARD PAUPERS’ WARD SPRINGFIELD ASYLUM - DAY (1925 228

DAN RIDER and LOUIS sit in the small grotty yard You can’t
see the outside world

RIDER looks at LOUIS warmly who seems only half here as he
sits back philosophically in his chair

DAN RIDER
Well that is quite a story

LOUIS shrugs DAN RIDER looks at him thoughtfully

DAN RIDER (CONTD)
- Do you like it here Mr Wain

LOUIS shakes his head very slightly

LOUIS
There are no cats And I
cannot see outside

DAN RIDER
That must be difficult for someone
like you Mr Wain who has spent
his entire life examining the
world suddenly not to see it

They sit in silence Tears begin to form in LOUIS’ eyes
DAN RIDER (CONTD)
Do you miss your wife Mr Wain
Do you miss Emily

LOUIS nods Quite a long silence RIDER doesn’t want to push

LOUIS
- I have failed

DAN RIDER frowns MUSIC BEGINS VERY GENTLY

LOUIS (CONTD)
I have failed her Mr Rider

DAN RIDER
-- I don’t think you have failed
Mr Wain from what you have been
saying

LOUIS does not agree
DAN RIDER (CONTD)
Why do you think Emily wanted you

to keep painting pictures Mr Wain

LOUIS
To help people to show them

DAN RIDER
Perhaps and there’s no doubt
that you have done that but I
have a rather different theory

LOUIS looks at DAN - what could he possibly mean

DAN RIDER (CONTD)
I think she wanted you to keep
painting so you would not be
alone

Slowly this starts to get to him The MUSIC IS BUILDING

DAN RIDER (CONTD)
When you paint Mr Wain You
connect with other people And you
give them a piece of yourself
But they are also connecting
with you and that electricity
that you describe that you felt
in the presence of Emily I would
call that love Mr Wain

LOUIS is looking at DAN through tears

END OF SEQUENCE

INT INFIRMARY NAPSBURY - DAWN (C1930) 245

A SHAFT OF WARM LIGHT shines in through the window LOUIS
sits at a table in a communal area He is surrounded by his
painting materials and we notice EMILY’S ROCKS

He leafs through his journal and is cradling a CAT who purrs
gently A COUPLE OF OTHER CATS are curled up around the room

LOUIS lands on the pages that EMILY once saw when she sneaked
into his room He stops Inside the journal is a small
cutting of EMILY’S PATTERNED BLUE SHAWL LOUIS holds it Even
now she is full of surprises

He looks up out of the window LOUIS grabs some paper and
paints and heads out slowly As he leaves we see the colours
outside are VIVID and BRIGHT

SCENE OMITTED 246

EXT NAPSBURY ASYLUM - DAWN 247
A feeling of peace as LOUIS walks around the grounds of the
comfortable looking hospital surrounded by greenery CATS

are snoozing in the sun A FEW OTHER PATIENTS relax drift
around sit sleep

COLOURS ARE VIVID AS HE CONTINUES WALKING TOWARDS A WOOD

EXT WOODS - DAWN 248

His feet are in slippers as he treads on twigs and shrubs
Details of the paints that he is clutching under his arm

THE COLOURS ARE BURNING BRIGHTER AND MORE VIVID AS HE GOES
TRAILING WISPS OF STRANGE INCANDESCENCE HE CONTINUES TO WALK
FOR SOME TIME EVERYTHING IS IN BLOOM THE SUN CASTS A LIGHT
OVER LOUIS AS HE WALKS

Finally he stops He is faced with a quite extraordinary
scene A little brook laps over a fallen tree BIRDS swoop in
and out of vision

ELECTRIC GREENS AND YELLOWS AND PINKS AND BLUES BURNING
SURREAL AND BRIGHT

It vividly recalls the place where he EMILY and PETER once
stood together all those years ago It’s a magical image
It’s an image we will remember

LOUIS
- Look
