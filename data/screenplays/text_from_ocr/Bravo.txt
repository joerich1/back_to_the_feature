strung out along the valley road Riding at the head of the
train are WHEELER the wagon boss and COLORADO RYAN the
guard---a young cunhand on his first big job Apart from the
Wagon train there is no sound or movement in the valley but
the wind and there is a brooding ominous quality in the
atmosphere as though the wagon train is moving toward some
dramatic encounter Suddenly Colorado touches Wheelers
shoulder and points to the cliffs on his right

On a broad ledge of the cliffs solitary hor seman sits

motionless watching the valley

sitting his horse in the middle of the road is the Dude The
Dude wears a star a Sheriffs deputy He is a small man
almost frail-looking At one time his name had been a legené
on the Texas’ border They had talked of his speed with a gur
of his deceptive mild manner of his friendship with the
Sheriff John T Chance But that was the past Now for two
years Dude has been on the bottle two years as the town
drunk He wears a battered hat ragged clothes run-down
boots He is unshtven and very close to the shakes But for
the time being under stress he is sober and desperately

‘efficient Wheeler rides up to him but Dude speaks first

moving---tell your men to stay with em till
