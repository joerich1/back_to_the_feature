December 181998

All IS A BLUR

then WORDS appear twisting and vaguely transparent
reflected on the window GRADY TRIPP stands before as he
reads from a sheaf of NEATLY-TYPED PAGES

GRADY
The young girl sat perfectly still in the
confessional

INT CLASSROOM - UNIVERSITY - AFTERNOON

Grady--45-year-old novelist professor and insomniac--is
in the midst of reading a story to the dozen college
STUDENTS who make up his Advanced Writing Workshop

GRADY
listening to her fathers boots scrape like
chalk on the ancient steps of the church then
grow faint then disappear altogether

As he finishes GRADY ponders a PAIR of MAINTENANCE MEN
perched on ladders in the quad below stringing a LARGE
BANNER between two bare trees The BANNER reads

WELCOME TO WORDFEST

GRADY turns peers at his students They look as if
theyve been on a field trip to the DMV

GRADY (contd)
(a wave of the pages)
So Anyone

A GIRL with jet-black hair turns to a PALE YOUNG MAN
sitting at a desk in the back of the classroom He is JAMES
LEER 19 Like GRADY a moment before he is staring out the
window

CARRIE MCWHIRTY
Let me get this straight The girl with the
big lips is depressed because each night when
her father goes off to work at the bakery her
mother sneaks some mysterious lover into the
house Not only does this girl have to listen
to her mother working this guy in the next
room she has to wash the sheets each morning
before Daddy gets home After a few weeks of
this she starts to go a little nutty so Daddy
takes her to confession--only once she gets in
the box she gets a whiff of the priest and
realizes hes the mothers secret lover Is
that it

James Leer says nothing huddling lower in the PATTY
OVERCOAT he wears

CARRIE MCWHIRTY
I mean Jesus What is it with you Catholics

GRADY
All right Lets try to keep it constructive
shall we Howard what about you

HOWARD
I hated it

GRADY
Thats not exactly what I meant by
constructive Howard

HOWARD
I think James should try to be more
constructive This is my second semester with
him His stories are brutal man They make me
want to kill myself

GRADY glances at James but his face remains impassive
Then--with a visible sense of relief--GRADY notices the
raised hand of the achingly beautiful HANNAH GREEN

GRADY
Yes Hannah

HANNAH GREEN
I think maybe were missing the point It
seems to me James strength as a writer is that
he doesnt take us by the hand He treats us
like adults He respects us enough to forget
us That takes courage

GRADY nods smiles subtly Appreciative
GRADY
Well put Hannah And a good note to end on I
think
(as the students rise)

Dont forget about WordFest this weekend And
remember those of you driving VIPs to
tonights cocktail party need to have them at
the Chancellors house no later than 530

Hannah Green gathers her things pauses by Grady

GRADY
Thanks for that He all right

HANNAH GREEN
I think so What about you

GRADY
Me Sure Why

HANNAH GREEN
Just checking

GRADY watches her glide away in her CRACKED RED COWBOY
BOOTS then starts to exit himself

JAMES LEER
Turn out the light please

GRADY pauses studying the wan figure sitting at the back
of the classroom then--reluctantly-hits the switch on the
wail leaving James Leer alone in the DARK

INT STAIRWELLCORRIDOR - AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER)

GRADY hurries down the steps then spies SARA GASKSLL
45 standing below She is talking to a BOY with an armful
of SLICK PROGRAMS

SARA

(calm but firm)
No Elliot I said five hundred programs for
today This means we have no programs for the
weekend This means that tomorrow morning at
9AM several hundred people will walk into Thaw
Hall and have absolutely no idea where they are
going

(shaking her head)
Its all right Elliot Ill take care of it

GRADY watches Sara take the programs turn and spot him
There is the slightest of hesitations then
SARA
Professor Tripp

GRADY
Chancellor

SARA
I got the message you called

GRADY
I got the message you called too

This hangs in the air awkward somehow then both nod and
continue on without so much as a backward glance

INT GRADYS CAR - MOVING

The RADIO BLASTS as GRADY pops the glove box removes a
JOINT as big as his pinky and wheels his DARK MAROON 66
GALAXIE RAGTOP away from campus cruising under another
BANNER

WELCOME TO WORDFEST FEBRUARY 26-28
EXT GALAXIE - MOVING - PITTSBURGH

GRADY cruises past the three rivers and modest
skyscrapers of downtown sipping at the weed

INT PITTSBURGH AIRPORT

GRADY rides the long automated treadmill that runs half
the length of the terminal until

INT ARRIVAL GATE - PITTSBURGH AIRPORT

TERRY CRABTREE--Gradys editor and friend-exits the
tunnel with a STUNNING YOUNG WOMAN in a skin-tight black
dress bright red topcoat and three-inch spike heels
Grinning devilishly Crabtree whispers something in the
womans ear then spots Grady

CRABTREE
Tripp

GRADY
How are you Crabtree

CRABTREE
Brimming Say hello to my new friend Miss
Antonia uh
WOMAN
Sloviak

CRABTREE
took the liberty of inviting Antonia to
tonights festivities You dont mind do you
Trip

GRADY
(a slight beat)
The more the merrier

fq

MISS SLOVIAK
Terry was telling me about you on the plane
t was ail so interesting

fq

CRABTREE
was explaining to Antonia how a book comes
to be published What you do as a writer what
do as an editor

GRADY
sweat blood for five years and he checks for
spelling

MISS SLOVIAK
(indicating Crabtree)
Thats exactly what he said

CRABTREE

We know each other pretty well
(to Grady)

So wheres Emily

GRADY
Emily

CRABTREE
Your wife

GRADY

Oh Were picking her up Downtown

CRABTREE
Perfect Well then shall we

GRADY nods but lingers briefly--studying the
architecture of Miss Sloviaks ankles as she CLICKS off in

her spike heels arm in arm with Crabtree

INT BAGGAGE CAROUSEL - AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER
GRADY and Crabtree watch suitcases tumble as Miss Sloviak
sits across the way inspecting her face in a compact

CRABTREE
Do you know how many times Ive boarded an
airplane praying someone like her would sit
down beside me Particularly while Im on my
way to Pittsburgh

GRADY
Lay off Pittsburgh Its one of the great
cities

CRABTREE

If it can produce a Miss Sloviak youll get no
argument from me

GRADY
Shes a transvestite

CRABTREE
Youre stoned

GRADY

Shes still a transvestite

CRABTREE

GRADY
Isnt she

Crabtree ignores Gradys question smiling placidly as he
watches the carousel spin

CRABTREE
So hows the book

GRADY stiffens He had been expecting this but not so
soon He tries to act casual

GRADY
Its fine Its done Basically Im just sort
of tinkering with it

CRABTREE

Great I was hoping I could get a look at it
sometime this weekend Think that might be
possible

GRADY
dont know Im sort of at a critical
juncture

CRABTREE
thought you were tinkering

GRADY
just mean
CRABTREE
Forget I asked I dont want to pressure you
Tripp But
(pointedly)

I get pressure Know what I mean

GRADY ponders this troubled by it Suddenly Crabtrees
face brightens again

CRABTREE
Ah well now What do you suppose that would
be

GRADY turns watches an immense PONY HIDE CASE drop onto
the carousel

GRADY
That would be a tuba

INT GRADYS CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON

As the Galaxie emerges from a TUNNEL GRADY watches the
great city of Pittsburgh reveal itself in the distance
then glances in the rearview mirror

GRADY
That perfume youre wearing Antonia It
wouldnt happen to be Cristaile would it

MISS SLOVIAK
Why yes How did you know

GRADY
Lucky guess

CRABTREE
You didnt actually purchase this car did
you Trip

GRADY
It was Jerry Nathans He owed me money

CRABTREE
He owes God money You know he queered
himself for good with Esquire

GRADY takes a joint from the ashtray snaps a Scripto
butane

GRADY
He said something about being between things

CRABTREE
Yeah between a bookie and a pair of broken
legs

EXT OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

A YOUNG WOMAN with a crumpled PITTSBURGH STEEIERS

UMBRELLA exits the building and-seeing GRADY parked in
front of a fire hydrant--stops a puzzled expression on her
face As she approaches GRADY roils down the passenger
window

GRADY
Hi Tanya
(to the others)
This is Tanya My wifes secretary

CRABTREE and MISS SLOVIAK smile and nod Tanya smiles and
nods back her eyes passing uneasily over Gradys joint

TANYA
Grady Emilys not here

GRADY just smiles nods

TANYA (contd)
Is there anything I can do for you

GRADY watches a tiny stream of water trickle through
Tanyas sad umbrella

GRADY
Youre leaking Tanya

Tanya nods--at a loss-then turns away into the rain

CRABTREE
Trip

GRADY
She left me Crabs

CRABTREE

Left you Who Emily

GRADY

This morning I found a note in the kitchen

But

CRABTREE
why didnt you say something Tripp I

mean what are we doing here

GRADY gazes at the glittering scene beyond his

windshield

turns on the ignition

GRADY

I thought maybe I made it all up

EXT GASKELL HOUSE - EVENING

Through the windows a rabble of writers faculty and
select students can be SEEN mingling under a haze of
cigarette smoke GRADY brings the Galaxie to a lurching
halt across the street parks in front of another fire
hydrant As the trio steps out MISS SLOVIAK notices a

GREENHOUSE

fq

fq

Oh

EXT FRONT

shimmering quietly in the chill night air

MISS SLOVIAK

Thats a nice greenhouse

GRADY

ts Mrs Gaskells Her hobby

CRABTREE

ripp

GRADY

Piss off Crabs I lost a wife today

CRABTREE
Im sure youll find another You always

PORCH - GASKELL HOUSE

As the front door swings open Sara Gaskell appears
riding a wave of jagged party CHATTER onto the porch

SARA

Well hello everyone Terry good to see you
again

CRABTREE

Chancellor Dont you look ravishing
SARA
Arent you sweet to say so I was beginning to
wonder if you were ever going to--oh

As Sara steps forward her heel-catches and she pitches
forward into Gradys arms

GRADY
Easy there

SARA
Im sorry Its these goddamned shoes I dont
know how anyone actually walks in these things

MISS SLOVIAK
Practice

Sara looks at Miss Sloviak a faint glitter of scientific
curiosity in her eye

SARA
I dont believe weve met

MISS SLOVIAK
Antonia Antonia Sloviak--

Just then a THICKLY-MUCSCLED DOG with very strange EYES
skitters around the corner BARKING SAVAGELY in the general
direction of Grady

SARA
Poe

CRABTREE
(mildly)
This wouldnt be Walters dog would it

Poe continues to rage his paws doing crazy eights on the
hardwood floor until hes spun himself completely around

and is barking at the living room

MISS SLOVIAK
Who s he barking at now

GRADY
Hes still barking at me Hes blind

SARA
Poe Hush Now stop this Honestly

As Poe simmers to a deep growl GRADY leans forward

GRADY
I need to talk to you

SARA
Thats funny I need to talk to you too
(strategy in her tone)
Perhaps you could put some of these coats in
the upstairs guest room Professor Tripp

GRADY
(reading her)
I dont believe I know where the upstairs
guest room is

SARA
Well then Id better show you Terry--

CRABTREE
Well just make ourselves at home
(kneeling by Poe)
Wont we Poe Yes yes

INT UPSTAIRS ROOM

GRADY enters a room swimming in BASEBAIL MEMORABILIA
AUTOGRAPHED BASEBALLS abound as well as PHOTOGRAPHS of
famous big-leaguers In one somewhat-dated PHOTO a TRIM MAN
IN HIS FORTIES (a younger Walter Gaskell) stands with
PITTSBURGH PIRATE BILL MAZEROSKI at an old-timers game As
Sara eases the door shut GRADY nods to a 1951 YANKEES
PENNANT hanging over the mantle

GRADY
New

SARA
(nodding)
Walter just got it back from the framer today

Sara takes Gradys hand drawing him away from the
pennant and down onto the coat-covered bed

SARA
You go first

GRADY
All right This morning--

SARA
Im pregnant
A flash of LAUGHTER flutters from the living room below
GRADY starts to speak

SARA

Im sure
GRADY

Well This issurprising Does Walter
SARA

I think Walter would find this a little more
than surprising

GRADY nods getting her drift then roils onto his back

GRADY
Emily left me this morning

SARA
Shes left before
GRADY
Shes left the room before She always came
back
Sara nods Considers this
SARA

So I guess we just divorce our spouses marry
each other and have this baby right Simple

GRADY
Simple

GRADY and Sara stare at the ceiling Sara sniffs the coat
lying beneath her Miss Sloviaks coat

SARA
Is that Cristaile

GRADY
Hm

SARA

(weary)
My God I wear the same scent as a
transvestite She IS a transvestite isnt
she

GRADY
If shes not now Terry will make sure she is
by the end of the evening

SARA
Has he asked to see the book yet

GRADY
Yes

SARA
And Are you going to tell him

GRADY
No Maybe I dont know I dont know what Im
going to do

SARA
(distantly)
Neither do 1

GRADY starts to pull up but his arm is underneath Sara

GRADY
Sara my arm Im stuck honey

SARA
I guess youre going to have to chew it off
then

INT LIVING ROOM - GASKELL HOUSE

Poe noses blindly through a forest of legs pauses by

Miss Sloviaks high heels and scores a Rye Krisp Crabtree
returning with a pair of DRINKS tiptoes around him finds
MISS SLOVIAK chatting with a trim MAN in his 50s

CRABTREE
Walter I see youve met my friend

WALTER GASKELL
Yes She s charming

MISS SLOVIAK
(taking her drink)
Walters been telling me the most fascinating
things about Marilyn Monroe and who was it

WALTER GASKELL
Joe DiMaggio Simply put Antonia it s my
contention that their marriage tapped into the
very id of American popular culture Joe
DiMaggio represented metaphorically speaking
the Husband as Slugger And though it may be
controversial I personally believe every
woman in some way desires to be Marilyn
Monroe

MISS SLOVIAK
Oh I couldnt agree more

NEW ANGLE

GRADY works his way through the crowd spies Walter and
changes course Directly ahead is an oddly commanding MAN
(OQ) From the behavior of the people in his vicinity its
clear he is someone of interest Presently he is putting
the make on Hannah Green

Q

And while my latest has been on the New York
Times bestseller list for 40 weeks I cant
help but lament that my first book which
contains what I consider my finest writing was
remaindered in less than five So I find
myself conflicted

GRADY
Ask him if hes conflicted about his house in
the Hamptons

HANNAH GREEN
(brightening)
Grady

Q eyes GRADY over his wine glass

Q

Hello Professor

GRADY
Q Hannahs had two stories published in The
Paris Review Youd best dust off the A
material for her

As GRADY moves off he sees Poe sniffing and goes the
other way heading directly into the crosshairs of a MAH IN
TWEED who is talking to another shorter MAN

MAN IN TWEED

(to short man)
A supermarket for the mind my ass Im
telling you theyre nothing but a big fat mob
laundry Have you ever been to Davenport Iowa
Let me tell you they need a 30000-square-foot
bookstore like they need another goddamn cow

(as GRADY passes)
Grady

GRADY
Hello Nathan

MAN IN TWEED
My God I havent seen you since what The
PENFaulkner Awards That was a big night for
you Grady
(to his friend)
GRADY was there for Arsonists Daughter

The short man blinks impulsively takes Gradys hand

SHORT MAN
Douglas Triddly Amherst I kid you not when I
say Arsonists Daughter belongs in the pantheon
of late twentieth century fiction Ive had it
on my Graduate Studies syllabus three years
running

GRADY
(pulling away)
No wonder its still in print

As GRADY flees he passes a WOMAN holding a cigarette

WOMAN WITH CIGARETTE
can take my word for it writers are lousy
fucks Poets arent bad but then youve got to
deal with the sweater thing Theyll discover
the cancer in your heart every time but God
forbid they find a decent dry cleaner

EXT REAR GASKELL HOUSE - NIGHT

GRADY comes out the back door and ferrets a JOINT from
his pocket lights it He takes a long draw walks around
the side of the house As he passes a window a VOICE
accosts him

MANS VOICE
There you are

GRADY starts but when he looks through the window he
sees that the VOICE belongs to WALTER GASKELL and the
person to whom hes talking is Sara They are standing in
the kitchen near an elaborate WINE RACK

WALTER
I could swear I had a 63 Chateau Latour in
here You havent seen it have you
SARA
I doubt Id recognize a 63 Chateau Latour if
I was sitting on it

WALTER
Youd recognize it if you tasted it

SARA
I doubt it darling

WALTER
(angling and bottle to the light)
Well Q certainly will And given that he
will be addressing 500 people in little over an
hour

SARA
You want to keep him happy

WALTER
If he s happy
(kissing her as he exits)
Im happy

As Walter goes GRADY studies Sara as she stands alone in
the quiet little room looking small and tired Finally
she takes a breath steeling herself and moves off
returning to the clamor inside her house

GRADY sighs guilt-stricken then detects a FLICKER of
LIGHT coming from the darkness beyond A FIGURE is watching
him from the retaining wail that leads to the Gaskells
garage GRADY blinks chagrined that hes been caught
eavesdropping then his eyes narrow and he steps off the
porch

GRADY
James

James Leer wears the same nasty overcoat from class a
GREEN KNAPSACK hanging off one shoulder GRADY looks at
what appears to be a sliver of moonlight in James palm

JAMES LEER
Its fake

James face betrays his own fragile chagrin and GRADY
peers more closely at what lies in his extended hand The
sliver of moonlight is in fact a shiny PEARL-HANDLED
PISTOL
JAMES LEER
It was my mothers She won it in a penny
arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic
school

GRADY
Its very convincing

JAMES LEER
It used to shoot these little paper caps but
they dont make them anymore The caps

GRADY reaches for the gun but James closes his fingers
and slips the tiny thing back into his overcoat

JAMES LEER
Its just for good luck Some people carry
rabbits feet

GRADY

You carry firearms

As GRADY exhales a plume of smoke James eyes pass
briefly over the jay GRADY
notices offers

JAMES LEER
No thank you I dont like to lose control of
my emotions

GRADY nods accustomed to James weirdness

JAMES LEER
Im not supposed to be here in case you were
wondering I crashed I mean not
intentionally

James nods toward the house where Hannah Green can be
seen in a window still fending off the determined Q

JAMES LEER (contd)
but the other night Hannah and I were
together at the movies and she asked me
Since she was coming So I ended up coming
Too

GRADY nods ponders this over-elaborate explanation

GRADY
Are you and Hannah seeing each other James

JAMES LEER
No What gave you that idea

GRADY
Relax James Im not her father I just rent
her a room

JAMES LEER
She likes old movies like I do thats ail
(glancing back at the window)
Besides she doesnt really know me She
thinks she does but she doesnt Maybe its
because shes Mormon and Im Catholic

GRADY
Maybe its because shes beautiful and she
knows it and try as she might to not let that
screw her up its inevitable that it will in
some way

James looks away from the window at Grady

JAMES LEER
Youre not like my other teachers Professor
Tripp

GRADY

Youre not like my other students James So
what was the movie you two saw

JAMES LEER
Huh Oh Son or Fury With Tyrone Power and
Frances Farmer

GRADY
She went crazy Frances Farmer

JAMES LEER
So did Gene Tierney Shes in it too

GRADY
Sounds like a good one

JAMES LEER
(a crooked smile)
Its not bad

GRADY considers James fragile face

GRADY
Listen James about this afternoon In
workshop Im sorry I think I let things get a
bit out of control
JAMES LEER
They really hated it I think they hated it
more than any of the other ones

GRADY
Well

JAMES LEER
It doesnt matter It only took me an hour to
write

GRADY

(truly impressed)
Really Thats remarkable

JAMES LEER
I have trouble sleeping While Im lying in
bed I figure them out The stories

As James gazes off at the gloaming greenhouse GRADY
looks down at the left front POCKET of James overcoat
Like a nervous tic James hand- hidden-twitches against
the modest bulk of the cap gun

GRADY
You cold James
JAMES LEER
(distant)
A little
GRADY

So what are you doing out here

JAMES LEER
Its colder in there -

GRADY
(laughing)
Youre right

James blinks startled by Gradys laughter startled that
hes said something funny He looks back to the greenhouse

JAMES LEER
Actually I saw the greenhouse So I thought
I thought Id come out here and take a look
at it You dont see one of those every day It
looks like heaven

GRADY
Heaven

JAMES LEER
I saw a movie once Part of it took place in
heaven Everyone wore white and lived in
crystal houses Like that At least thats the
way I remember it

Abruptly James glances at his watch

JAMES LEER
I should be going

James turns away then stops He stands like this a
moment then turns back Holds out his right hand

JAMES LEER (contd)
Goodbye Professor Tripp

GRADY hesitates then shakes James hand James moves off
then leaving the light of the house behind

GRADY
James
(as he stops)
Dont leave just yet Theres something I
think you ought to see

JAMES LEER
Ill miss my bus

GRADY
This is worth it

James looks conflicted

GRADY (contd)
Trust me

15 INT LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Its quieter now the party winding down as GRADY sneaks James
past
the departing guests and toward the stairs

HANNAH GREEN
Hey you two

GRADY stops sees Hannah slipping on a coat in the foyer

HANNAH GREEN (contd)
Are you riding with me James
JAMES LEER
No Im going ho--

GRADY

friend All right

HANNAH GREEN

GRADY

Where are they exactly

CRABTREE
Here we are

CRABTREE appears at the top of the landing with Miss

Sloviak Her lipstick is blurry

CRABTREE
(spying James)
Nell hello there

CRABTREE steps down the stairs hand extended James

Leers pale fingers rise as if on a string

GRADY
James This is my editor Terry Crabtree

HANNAH GREEN
Jamesll know about George Sanders

JAMES LEER
George Sanders

HANNAH GREEN

Mr CRABTREE was saying how George Sanders
killed himself only he couldnt remember how

JAMES LEER

Pills August 25 1972 In a Costa Brava hotel

room

The few people within earshot glance oddly at James

Crabtrees eyes glitter with intrigue

CRABTREE
How comprehensive of you

HANNAH GREEN

but
Oh James is amazing He knows all the movie
suicides Go ahead James Tell them who else

JAMES LEER
Theres so many

HANNAH GREEN
Just a few then The big ones

James glances at the loose group of people around him
watching then

JAMES LEER
Pier Angeli 1971 or 72 also pills Charles
Boyer 1978 pills again Charles Butterworth

lipstick on his stomach Alan Ladd 64 more
pills Carole Landis pills again I forget
when George Reeves Superman on TV shot

Blandick Maggie McNamara Gia Scaia

HANNAH GREEN
I havent heard of half of those

CRABTREE
You did them alphabetically

James turns finds Crabtrees laser eyes on him James
blinks as if he had forgotten about Crabtree then shrugs
shyly looks away

JAMES LEER
Thats just how my brain works I guess

CRABTREE
Fascinating Listen why dont you come out
with us after the lecture Theres a place on
the Hill I always get Trip to take me

JAMES LEER
Actually I just want to go home
CRABTREE
Oh dont be silly No one your age just wants
to go home Besides faculty will be present
Just think of it as a field trip

As he exits CRABTREE raises an eyebrow to Grady as if
to say Bring him MISS SLOVIAK follows eyeing James
glacially as we CUT TO

BLACK

The dull PURR of a COMBINATION LOCK is HEARD a DOOR
opens and a triangle of LIGHT falls on a PHOTOGRAPH of
MARILYN MONROES JOE DIMAGGIO on their wedding day

INT CLOSET - GASKELL HOUSE

GRADY and James Leer stand in the doorway Just below the
photograph of Marilyn and Joe--hanging next to a PIN-
STRIPED JERSEY bearing the number 5--is a SHORT BLACK SATIN
JACKET trimmed with an ERMINE COLLAR

JAMES LEER
Is that really it

GRADY
Thats really it

JAMES LEER

The one she wore on her wedding day

GRADY
So Im told

James in the presence of the holy grail of suicide
garments stands speechless

GRADY
(contd)
Go ahead
JAMES LEER
Really
GRADY
Really

James swallows then-goes to the jacket Carefully he
reaches out his fingers and touches the yellowed collar
barely making contact as though it might crumble to dust
JAMES LEER
Theyre glass The buttons

GRADY
Like the lady herself

GRADY says this airily ironically riding his buzz a
bit but James nods solemnly eyes transfixed on the
jacket as if Marilyn herself were inside it

JAMES LEER
She was small Most people dont know that
The shoulders are small
(touching the satin)

It looks so perfect bet its the only time
she wore it That day She mustve felt so
-happy

GRADY studies James as he takes the fringe of the jacket
lifts it lightly

JAMES LEER
Its feels unreal like butterfly wings or
something It mustve cost Dr Gaskell a lot

GRADY
I guess Walter never tells Sara the truth
about how much he pays for these things

JAMES LEER
Youre really good friends with the
Chancellor arent you

Gradys eyes slide paranoid but James face remains
unchanged consumed with the jacket

GRADY
(carefully)
Pretty good Im friends with Dr Gaskell
too

JAMES LEER
I guess you must be if you know the
combination to his closet and he doesnt mind
your being here in their bedroom like this

GRADY
Right

A DOOR SLAMS downstairs and GRADY and James jump The
CLICK of a womans HIGH HEELS sends GRADY to the bedroom
window where he watches Sara slide into a WHITE CITROEN

DS23 turn on the ignition and motor away

GRADY
We better skedaddle Close that closet--
James You ail right

James is slumped on the Gaskells white linen bed
knapsack between his knees head in hands

JAMES LEER
Im sorry Professor Tripp Maybe its seeing
that jacket that belonged to her It just
looksreally lonely Hanging there Ina
closet Maybe Im just a little sad

GRADY
Maybe Im feeling a little sad myself
tonight

JAMES LEER

You mean with your wife leaving you and ail
(off Gradys look)

Hannah mentioned something about it About a

note

GRADY
Yes Well Its complicated James I think we
should go now

Without thinking GRADY flicks out the bedroom light
leaving James Leer in the dark for the second time today

James just sits there a shadow in a room of shadows
INT HALLWAY

A LOW RUMBLE freezes GRADY

as he enters the hail A few feet away Poe lies belly to
the ground his blind blue eyes trained more or less in
Gradys direction

GRADY
Okay Easy now Eee-zy

GRADY starts to take a step when Poe shoots forward
and sinks himself deep into Gradys ankle

GRADY
Jesus

GRADY hops gracelessly momentarily lifting Poe off the
ground as he swings his leg up Poe countering rolls his
head in a snapping motion and drops GRADY in a clumsy heap

GRADY
Get off of me you son-of-a-bitch

Poe regains his feet but doesnt let go whipping his
head back and forth back and forth over and over
growling low dark and hideously from the back of his
throat until there is a sharp

CRACK CRACK

Poe YELPS goes perfectly still then topples heavily
onto Gradys legs GRADY

turns James Leer stands in the doorway posed with the
little pearl-handled pistol like Steve McQueen

GRADY looks at James Then Poe Then back to James

GRADY
Shit James You shoe Dr Gaskells dog

JAMES LEER
I had to Didnt I

GRADY
Couldnt youve just pulled him off me

JAMES LEER
No He was crazy I didnt-he looked-- 1
thought --

GRADY
Okay okay Take it easy Dont freak out on
me

GRADY roils down his sock Apparently Poe went through
life with a slight overbite

JAMES LEER
Do you have a mirror Its the best way to see
if someones breathing

GRADY
Hes dead James Believe me I know a dead
dog when I see one

James looks miserably at Poe

JAMES LEER
What are we going to do
GRADY rises awkwardly holds out his hand

GRADY
First youre going to give me that little cap
gun of yours

18 INT GALAXIE - MOVING

GRADY and James stare gloomily out the windshield

JAMES LEER
Professor Tripp Can I ask you a question

GRADY
Yea James

JAMES LEER
What are we going to do with

James glances in the backseat where Poe lies strange
blue eyes gleaming

GRADY
I dont know Im still trying to figure out
how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her
husbands dog

JAMES LEER
You

GRADY
Trust me James when the family pets been
assassinated the owner doesnt want to hear
one of her students was the triggerman

JAMES LEER
Does she want to hear it was one of her
professors
GRADY
Ive got tenure
19 EXT PARKING LOT -- THAW HALL (CAMPUS)

As sporadic APPLAUSE wafts from the high windowpanes of
Thaw Hall GRADY leans into the Galaxies trunk creates a
space between the tuba and a ZIPPERED SUITCASE

GRADY
Okay

James totters forward arms hooked under Poes front legs
looking like a sorry marathon dancer GRADY frowns limps
forward and takes the hind legs

JAMES LEER
Hes still a little warm

They lay him down push him deep into the trunk--until
there is a SOUND like a pencil SNAPPING

JAMES LEER
Yuck

GRADY grabs Crabtrees garment bag frisks the pockets

JAMES LEER
Thats a big trunk It fits a tuba a
suitcase a dead dog and a garment bag almost
perfectly

GRADY
(searching)
Thats just what they used to say in the ads
Come on Crabtree I know youre holding

JAMES LEER
Whose tuba is that anyway

GRADY
Miss Sloviaks

JAMES LEER
Can I ask you something about her

GRADY
She is Ah Here we go

GRADY unravels a pair of boxer shorts finds an airplane-
size bottle of JACK DANIELS then grabs another pair of
boxers

JAMES LEER
Oh So Is--is your friend Crabtree-- is he--
gay

GRADY

Most of the time he is James Some of the
time he isnt Now what do we have here

GRADY rattles a prescription bottle then shakes out a
pair of WHITE PILLS each etched with a tiny numeral 3

GRADY

Looks like our old friend Mr Codeine That

should take the pinch out of my ankle
(handing the bottle to James)

Have one

JAMES LEER
No thanks Im fine without them

GRADY
Right Thats why you were standing in the
Chancellors back yard twirling that little cap
gun of yours tonight Youre fine all right
youre fit as a fucking fiddle

GRADY opens the tiny bottle of Jack with his teeth
drinks down two number 3s then looks at James

GRADY
Im sorry James Im sorry I said that

Recklessly James takes a pill tosses it in his mouth

and tips back the tiny bottle of Jack Half a second later
he spits it all out GRADY looks down peels the soggy pill
from the lapel of his jacket

GRADY
How bout we try that again

INT AUDITORIUM - LATER
On the stage Walter Gaskell stands alone at a podium

WALTER
really needs no introduction Walk down the
aisle of any airplane or by the pool of any
hotel and youll see his face beaming back at
you You all know the name you all know the
books so welcome if you will the man those of
us who know him simply call Q

As the audience THUNDERS GRADY and James slink into the
auditorium Its standing room only As they head for an
open space against the back wail GRADY squeezes past a KID
with a GOATEE who regards him warily

Q

Good evening

GRADY stares over the gleaming sea of heads before him
watching as Q pauses for a very long moment waiting
until the auditorium is consumed in a heavy anticipatory
hush Finally he speaks again

I am a writer

As the audience EXPLODES with glee GRADY frowns He
glances to his right sees James left brow crinkled with a
similar look of bafflement

Q (contd)
As a writer one thing you learn is that
everyone you encounter has a story Every
bartender every taxi driver everybody has an
idea or a story that would make a great book
or a great movie Presumably each of you has
an idea (gestures to the audience)
But how do you go from there to here How do
you go from having an idea to having a book
How do you get across What is the bridge the
bridge that allows you to walk on air from the
shoreline of inspiration to the terra firma of
accomplishment Faith Faith that your story is
worth the telling faith that you have the
wherewithal to tell it faith that the
carefully woven structure you create wont
collapse beneath you

GRADY glances at James sees that his eyes are unblinking
and glazed then sees beyond him Sara standing by the far
EXIT A blink later she is gone

Q (contd)
and faith that when you get to the other
side someone will be waiting who gives a damn
about the tale you have to tell

GRADY leans back listening to the BEATING of his own
HEART the soft GLIMMER of the chandeliers hanging by a
thread forty feet above his head

Abruptly James LAUGHS OUT LOUD--some private amusement
bubbling up from the bottom or his brain and out into the
auditorium As Q looks and four hundred other heads turn
James ducks down--mortified Crabtree sitting a few rows
away studies James with amusement then winks at Grady

GRADY blinks turns to James

GRADY
Ill be right back

INT LOBBY
GRADY bursts through the auditorium doors and into the
lobby A PAIR of local BOOKSELLERS chatting quietly
behind a table arrayed with the BOOKS of attending authors
glance up as GRADY limps toward the restrooms

INT CORRIDOR

GRADY stumbles down the sloping carper but the corridor
begins to turn sideways on him and he stops resting his
cheek against the coolcoolwall asail-goes

BLACK FOR A
MOMENT AND THEN

SARAS VOICE
Grady Grady

GRADY opens his eyes finds Saras face swimming above
him He is lying on his back in the corridor his corduroy
blazer bundled under his head like a pillow

SARA
You had another one didnt you You have to
see a doctor Grady First thing Monday

GRADY
Is the thing-is it over

SARA
Almost Wane to sit up

GRADY

GRADY looks at his ankle and feels a rush of guilt

GRADY
I have to tell you something Something
shard

Saras face stiffens becomes more Chancelloresque
SARA
Then stand up Im too old for all this

roiling around on the floor

GRADY lets her pull him up watches her light a
cigarette
GRADY
Well

SARA

GRADY
No really Sara I dont think you--

SARA
You love Emily I know that And you need to
stay with her

GRADY
I dont think I really have a choice in that
Emily left me

SARA
Shell come back Thats why Im going to

GRADY watches her flip her hand up bring the cigarette
to her lips and inhale then grimace and drop it to the
floor

GRADY
Not have it

SARA
No Theres no way I mean dont you think
theres no way

GRADY
Well no I dont see any way
(taking her hand)
And I know how hard it is for you to-- to lose
this chance

SARA
(jerking away)
No you dont And fuck you for saying you do
And fuck you for saying
(quietly)
for saying theres just no way Because
there could be a way Grady

Somewhere deep in the building APPLAUSE swells
SARA

(composing herself)
He must be finishing We should go

GRADY looks sadly at Sara then stoops to retrieve his
coat As he grabs it James Leers little pistol CLATTERS
to the floor

SARA
Whos gun is that

GRADY
Its-its a souvenir Of Baltimore

Before GRADY can close his hand Sara has it in her own

SARA
Heavy Smells like gunpowder

GRADY
Caps

She points it-at Gradys chest He smiles nervously

SARA
Pow
GRADY
You got me
SARA
I love you Grady
GRADY places his fingers gently over Saras and

removes the gun from her hand

GRADY
I love you too

INT LOBBY

The auditorium doors swing open and James Leer emerges
arms draped over CRABTREE and a LARGE STUDENT

JAMES LEER
Woah The doors made so much noise

As they make for the restrooms Sara and GRADY appear

JAMES LEER
This is so embarrassing You guys had to carry
me out

GRADY

Is he ail right

CRABTREE
(rolling his eyes)
Hes fine Hes narrating

JAMES LEER
Were going to the mens room Only we might

SARA

MISS SLOVIAK

GRADY

EXT STREET 24

As the Galaxies big trunk yawns open MISS SLOVIAK
stares at whats wedged up against her suitcase

GRADY
Theres an explanation

MISS SLOVIAK raises an eyebrow and then leaning in
unzips her suitcase

INT GRADYS CAR - MOVING

As GRADY drives MISS SLOVIAK finishes with the top
button of a mans shirt then reaches into the zippered
COSMETICS BAG in her lap Onto the open tray of the

glovebox she places a JAR of COLD CREAM a BOTTLE of NAIL

POLISH REMOVER and a cloud of COTTON BALLS

MISS SLOVIAK
Couldnt he have just thrown a shoe at the

GRADY
James is I dont know

MISS SLOVIAK
Disturbed And when your friend CRABTREE gets
done with him hes going to be even more
disturbed
GRADY

MISS SLOVIAK

GRADY watches MISS SLOVIAK peel the wig from her
forehead

GRADY
Listen Antonia--

MISS SLOVIAK

GRADY
Tony Im sorry if things didnt work out so
well for you tonight With Terry

MISS SLOVIAK
Forget it I shouldve known better Your
friend is just I dont know into collecting
weird tricks Mind

Tony angles the rearview mirror toward himself

GRADY
Hes writing his name in water

MISS SLOVIAK
Whats that

GRADY
Like most editors he really wants to be a
writer but hes too busy living a novel to
bother writing one

MISS SLOVIAK
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a
shit

GRADY
Hed call it habit But now I get the
feeling hes going through the motions a bit

Tony peels off a pair of false eyelashes blinks

MISS SLOVIAK
You mean because his careers ruined and all

GRADY

Jesus Is that what he told you

MISS SLOVIAK
He said he hasnt had a success in ten years
and everyone in New York thinks hes kind of
oa

As Tony re-sets the rearview mirror GRADY gets a glimpse
of his own swollen eyes

MISS SLOVIAK
loser But Im sure your book is so good
that hell be able to keep his job

Hearing this GRADY looks troubled MISS SLOVIAK points
MISS SLOVIAK
(contd)

Turn here

EXT SLOVIAK HOUSE

GRADY pulls in front of a small brick house On the front
lawn a small statue of the BLESSED VIRGIN stands under a
little white BAND SHELL painted with stars

GRADY
That s nice All we have is a Japanese

beetle trap

MISS SLOVIAK
Its a bathtub What shes standing under

The PORCH LIGHT conies on and a SMALL WHITE-HAIRED MAN
squints through the screen door

MISS SLOVIAK

GRADY reaches into his pocket hands it over Tony
smirks

MISS SLOVIAK

would carry In a little beaded purse

GRADY studies the gun in Tonys hand then glances at the
front screen door Pop is still there

GRADY

27A

James Leer

MISS SLOVIAK returns the gun steps out of the car and
peers in at Grady

MISS SLOVIAK

You know Grady if I were you Id think
about going home You look like you need a
little rescuing yourself

EXT PARKING LOT - HI-HAT CLUB

GRADY parks near a VAN that has KRAVNIKS SPORTING GOODS
stenciled on the side He watches a BOUNCER frisk a patron
in the PINK LIGHT of the Hi-Hat Clubs entrance then
slides -James Leers little PISTOL into the glovebox

EXT ENTRANCE - HI-HAT CLUB

As GRADY steps to the door the bouncer gives him a
perfunctory pat-down

BOUNCER
(kidding him)
Clean tonight hub Professor

GRADY
As a whistle

INT HI-HAT CLUB

Hannah Green is dancing with a sweat-drenched Q as GRADY
enters this SMOKE-FILLED RHYTHM AND BLUES club She beckons
with a finger but Grady--Nervous at the sight of her
glistening Mormon skin--merely pantomimes an exaggerated
shrug and she points

CRABTREE and James Leer sit at a dark corner table James
slouches eyes half-closed while CRABTREE stares in the

general vicinity of the dancers his hand extended beneath
the table in the general vicinity of James lap

Grady looking a little alarmed grabs a passing
WAITRESS

GRADY
Double Dickel on the rocks

INT BOOTH

As GRADY arrives CRABTREE withdraws his hand delicately
and James eyes flutter open briefly then close

GRADY
Is that just beer

CRABTREE
Primarily Although I gather you two staged a
little raid on the CRABTREE pharmacopoeia You
missed a few bottles by the way

GRADY
Im sure Where is everyone

CRABTREE
Sara and Walter declined Guess they wanted to
go home and curl up on the couch with the dog

GRADY cuts James a glance trying to determine if hes
copped on Poe but James is winking out His head drifts

back against the wail settles with a gentle thunk

GRADY
Jesus Hes out

CRABTREE glances over nods

CRABTREE
He has a book

GRADY
I know He started it Fall semester

CRABTREE
He finished it Winter Break

GRADY looks up unable to disguise his surprise He
glances at James slack face tilted against the wall

CRABTREE
So Is he any good

GRADY
No Not yet he isnt

CRABTREE

Well Im going to read it anyway

GRADY
Come on Crabs Dont do this Hes one of

my students for Christ sake Im not even sure
if hes-
CRABTREE
He is Take my word for it

GRADY
I think its more complicated than that
Besides hes a littlescattered He almost
did something stupid tonight At least I
think so Anyway he doesnt need sexual
confusion thrown into the stew right now

CRABTREE
On the contrary it could be just the ticket

WAITRESS
(ducking in)
Double Dickel

GRADY
Thanks

GRADY notices the waitresss nametag (OOLA) and realiz
she is conspicuously PREGNANT He watches her disappea
beyond the blur of bodies on the dancefloor where Han
Greens slinky form seizes his attention

CRABTREE
No sexual confusion there eh Professor

GRADY
Shut up and drink

CRABTREE grins brings his bottle up then stops

CRABTREE
Oh my goodness Do you see what I see

GRADY follows Crabtrees glance and finds Oola again
its not Oola CRABTREE
is eyeing its her CUSTOMER

Men

Sitting alone in the dark booth is a SMALL BLACK MAN w
big hands a face peppered with scar tissue and--most

Vernon for his death

CRABTREE
(stumped)
Because because
JAMES LEER
(sleepily)

-he was killed when a gangster named

Freddie Nostrils tried to shoot his favorite

horse He took the bullet himself

GRADY and Crabtree turn to look at James Leer
one bloodshot eye to regard them

JAMES LEER
Vernon over there was in on the hit

who opens

James eye closes CRABTREE looks over at Grady

CRABTREE
That was good

GRADY
He heard everything we were saying

Just then Hannah Green bounces up in her red boots

HANNAH GREEN
Come on Teach I want you to dance with me

INT DANCEFLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

GRADY and Hannah reflected in bits and pieces in the
jack o lantern wail of MIRRORED TILE slow-dance to
sexy measured blues

HANNAH GREEN

HANNAH GREEN
And I love the inscription you wrote to me
Only Im not quite the downy innocent you thin

GRADY
I hope that isnt true We need all the downy
innocents we can get

GRADY spies the corner table watches CRABTREE say
something to Q and then casually stroke a lock of h
from James Leers forehead

HANNAH GREEN
So what are you going to do

GRADY

on the sofa

HANNAH GREEN

the snow shovels at this point

As GRADY lowers James into the seat he WHIMPERS curls
into a bail Hannah turns her puppy dog eyes on Grady

GRADY
Ail right In my office

As GRADY starts to turn away Hannahs fingers graze his
face

HANNAH GREEN

GRADY watches her fold her lovely self into the car and
drive away He sighs crosses to the Galaxie and just has
his hand on the doorhandle when a TINY FIGURE appears

GRADY flicks his eyes from the rearview mirror just as a
SHADOW looms in his headlights As he squashes the break
pedal Qs EYEGLASSES go flying into the windshield

Q

(squinting)
Oh my God What is that

Its Vernon waving his arms his shadow enormous in the
beams of light

GRADY
Whats this guys problem

CRABTREE
Just go around him

GRADY taps the accelerator but each time Vernon dances
back in front of Gradys grille

GRADY
Shit

CRABTREE
Back up Go out the other way

GRADY throws the car in reverse backs straight up then
turns up a one-way street He shoots down the alley behind
the Hi-Hat turns onto the adjoining street and watches
in amazement as Vernon materializes from behind the high
wooden fence that runs parallel to the Galaxie

As GRADY pinches the brakes Vernon grins

GRADY
Now what
Q
(mischievously)

You could always go over him

Then as the three men watch Vernon rocks back on his
heels and--with a gymnasts precision-pitches himself onto
the Galaxies big hood He -lands on his ass slides
smoothly off then takes a deep bow and disappears into the
night

GRADY glances at the young man on his sofa then looking
very tired reaches for the desk lamp and turns out the
light on the both of them

well-ordered in direct contrast to the lazy clutter of
Gradys office There is a DRAFTING TABLE and a COMPUTER
pads and pens neatly arranged alongside

A BULLITEN BOARD hangs on one wall bearing an intricate
mosaic of multi-colored index cards There are PRINTS
framed from various art exhibits and two of Gradys
DHSTJACKETS-—-including most prominently Arsonists
Daughter

There are PHOTOGRAPHS of EMILY too In a black turtleneck
with friends In a sundress with Grady In a billowing

Youre welcome

GRADY sits at his desk pours himself a cup of coffee

from the thermos then sets the cup directly in the center
of a galaxy of previous coffee rings Next he takes a
clean piece of paper balls it up and-with ritual
precision-strokes it into the MINIATURE BASKETBALL HOOP
that crowns the rim of the WASTE BASKET across the room

All net

A 9-VOLT CROWD ROAR belches from the hoop and without
further ceremony GRADY

turns to the blank page curling from his IBM SELECTRIC

quizzical face floating like a cloud above him

GRADY
Im okay I just lost my balance

JAMES LEER
I put you on the floor

GRADY
Oh

JAMES LEER
I thought you might--1l dont know-- swallow
your tongue or something
(nodding to Gradys robe)
I guess you really miss her huh

GRADY peers down at the geraniums blooming on the pockets
of the robe its overall fuzziness

GRADY
Huh Oh no This isnt Emilys I just write
in it

JAMES LEER

I guess theres probably a story behind that

GRADY
There is but its not that interesting

James nods Down the hallway in another room the
TELEPHONE RINGS

JAMES LEER
Want me to get that

GRADY
Sure

As James shuffles away in the sleeping bag GRADY rises
delicately and turns toward the window just in time to
see a POLICE CAR roil slowly by on the screen below

JAMES LEER
(returning)
He didnt give his name

GRADY
Who

JAMES LEER
The guy on the phone

GRADY
Whatd he say

JAMES LEER

He wanted to know if a GRADY Trip lived here
and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500
with black interior
GRADY
Whatd you tell him

JAMES LEER
Yes

GRADY
Good James If the Zodiac killer calls be
sure to mention the back door pops open with a
couple hard shakes to the right

JAMES LEER
I thought maybe youd won a radio contest or
something Is that single-spaced

James has noticed the towering stack of 20 Ib bond on
Gradys desk

GRADY
Afraid so

JAMES LEER
Thats a big book youre writing

GRADY
I think its sort of writing itself at this
point

JAMES LEER
Wow Hannah always swore you were working
but--

GRADY

awhile since Arsonists Daughter and some
people--some of the kids in workshop--thought
maybe you were

Good morning boys James

James waves feebly from beneath the sleeping bag

GRADY
(re James attire)
If-you re planning on staying for breakfast
Id put on something a little less comfortable
if I were you

As GRADY moves to his desk to reacquaint himself with the
page curling from the typewriter James continues to stare
into the emptiness of the hallway The sight of CRABTREE
seems to have made him suddenly queasy

JAMES LEER
Professor Tripp

GRADY
Hm

JAMES LEER

How did I get here last night

GRADY
No one seems to know where you live James
Hannah thought youd like my couch

JAMES LEER
And and before that Did I do anything
Anything bad

GRADY
Well James you did shoot the Head of the
English Departments dog and steal his most
prized piece of memorabilia

As James contemplates this the DOORBELL RINGS GRADY
looks up sees the POLICE CAR he noticed earlier now
parked at the bottom of his driveway

GRADY
Do yourself a favor James Hide

EXT FRONT PORCH

A POLICEMAN not much older than James Leer waits
door opens GRADY
appears

OFFICER PUPCIK

sleeping bag straining to hear

OFFICER PUPCIK (0S)

Someone you didnt know Who seemed out of

EXT FRONT PORCH
GRADY is scratching his head in mock thought

GRADY

particularly suspicious Wait There was one

OFFICER PUPCIK

GRADY
I could be wrong What happened anyway

OFFICER PUPCIK

Huh Oh someone pulled a BandE on Dr Gaskells

OFFICER PUPCIK

blind and we figure he just wandered off and
got run over

GRADY
The perpetrator

OFFICER PUPCIK
No the dog

GRADY

Pupcik nods slowly as if re-filing GRADY under Dealing
With Assholes

OFFICER PUPCIK
One other thing About this kid this student
of yours- Leer--James Leer You wouldnt know
how I could get in touch with him would you

GRADY
I might have his number on campus

OFFICER PUPCIK
Thats all right Well find him

Pete Pupcik smiles tips his big blue police hat and
turns away GRADY frowns starts to close the door

HANNAH GREEN (0S)
There you are

GRADY stiffens then turns to find Hannah Green across
the room in her t-shirt and cowboy boots looking ail dewy-
eyed and delectable

HANNAH GREEN
I thought we were going to talk Last night

GRADY
Oh Well I

Hannah stretches and the t-shirt slides dangerously up
her thighs
HANNAH GREEN
Its okay Im here when you want me

GRADY stands frozen as Hannah smiles sleepily pushes
through the swinging door into the kitchen A THUMPING is
heard as James tangled in the sleeping bag hitches down
the last few steps of the stairway He watches Pete Pupcik
drive away in his big police car

JAMES LEER
What do we do now

Before GRADY can reply the TELEPHONE sitting on the table next

to him

HHHHHRINGS

GRADY
Hello

SARAS VOICE
Grady its Sara Thank God youre there You

GRADY
Could you hold on a minute honey

With a look of wonderment GRADY watches his hand ever-
so- gently hang up the phone

GRADY
How bout we get the hell out of here

EXT GRADYS HOUSE - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER)

James now wearing one of Gradys flannel shirts beneath
his ratty overcoat follows Grady-to the Galaxie knapsack
swinging from his shoulder GRADY tosses him a ring of
KEYS

GRADY
You start her up

As GRADY runs a plastic WEDGE over the GLAZE of ice
blanketing the windshield James stares curiously at the
keys as if they were some strange artifact then slides
behind the steering wheel

JAMES LEER
(as the engine roars)

Hows that

GRADY

Well done James

As GRADY works James face comes into view then the
wedge SNAPS splintering into the flesh of Gradys hand

GRADY (contd)
Shit

James blinks pokes his head out the window

JAMES LEER
Youre bleeding Professor Tripp

INT AISLE - MARKET - MORNING (LATER)

GRADY and James stand in the sundries aisle of a
neighborhood MARKET GRADY

has a TIN of BAND-AIDS open and is presently plastering
his ragged thumb

GRADY
Where exactly do you live James

James in the midst of chugging from a 64-OUNCE JUG of
ORANGE JUICE stops

GRADY
Apparently not even Hannah Green has a clue as
to the location of your apartment

GRADY tosses the tin of band-aids into a small plastic
hand basket begins to move down the aisle

JAMES LEER
I got kicked out Well not exactly kicked
out I was asked to leave

GRADY
I guess theres probably a story behind that

JAMES LEER
There is but its not that interesting

GRADY
So where have you been staying

JAMES LEER
(a long pause)

The bus station

GRADY stares incredulously at James

JAMES LEER
Its not -so bad I know the night janitor
And theres a broken locker I can put my stuff

GRADY
(trying to fathom this)
But James I mean How long
JAMES LEER

A couple weeks Thats why thats why I had
the gun For protection

GRADY
Jesus James you shouldve told someone

JAMES LEER
Who
GRADY
I dont know
(unconvincingly)

Me

GRADY drops the basket at the check-out counter and

abruptly finds himself face to face with a BABY lolling

on the

shoulder of the woman before him The baby is

staring spellbound at a display ofQS LATEST
PAPERBACK GRADY

frowns

then detects the true source of enchantment a

spray of SHINY MYLAR GIFT BALLOONS

A thought evolves

GRADY (contd)
(the balloons)
What do you think of these

James takes another chug from his jug nods

JAMES LEER
Nice

EXT GASKELL HOUSE - MORNING

Grady squinting through the ten-inch panel of cleared
ice on the windshield roils slowly up onto the curb in
front of Walter and Sara Gaskells house then off

INT GALAXIE - CONTINUOUS

GRADY pops the glovebox takes out a PEN and scratches

something on the GIFT CARD attached to the BALLOON James

glances briefly at a plump ZIPLOC OF POT stashed in the
glovebox then peers at the house

JAMES LEER
(the house)
Isnt this

GRADY
Hm

GRADY gets out then pauses glancing at the giant orange
juice jug between James legs Its about half-down

GRADY
You better ease off that stuff James Its
pretty acidic

James takes a powdered donut that lies on his coat
studies it curiously

JAMES LEER
I cant help myself I dont know whats the
matter with me

GRADY
Shit James youre hungover What do you
thinks the matter with you

As GRADY turns away James ponders this then considers
the ring of white sugar imprinted on his coat and re-sets
the donut in precisely the same place

INT GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER

Through the steamy panes we SEE GRADY approach with the
balloon enter He crosses to a high table sets the
balloon down and steps back considering the placement

SARA 0S)
Feeling guilty

GRADY jumps--startled--and turns Sara has materialized
behind a ficus large POTTING GLOVES on her hands

SARA (contd)
I cant believe you hung up on me you dick

GRADY

Sara holds up one gloved hand

SARA

SARA

GRADY
About the baby

SARA

GRADY goes still watches Sara strip off the gloves drop
them on a table

SARA

Sara turns to leave then stops squinting far down the
street

SARA
Whos that sitting in your car

GRADY
James Leer

SARA

GRADY
Im sort of helping him work through some
issues

Sara raises an eyebrow then pushes through the door

SARA

GRADY watches her ripple across the glass head for the
house and wave James slumped low in the Galaxie offers
a limp hand in return but its too late

Shes already gone
INT GALAXIE - MOVING - LATER 54

GRADY cradles the wheel in his bandaged paw while James
sits stiffly the orange juice jug bobbing between his
thighs

JAMES LEER
She seemed to take it pretty well

GRADY
Yeah well actually

James looks over

GRADY (contd)
The moment didnt really present itself

James nods unsurprised then turns back to the window
staring at the landscape still sitting oddly still GRADY
glances at him At the orange juice jug

GRADY (contd)
You re not planning on puking in my car are

Nothing

GRADY
Dont be proud James Were in Sewickley
Heights We could find you a nice golf course

GRADY looks over surprised by the James tone James
blinks looks embarrassed

JAMES LEER (contd)

James peers out the window at passing landscape

JAMES LEER (contd)
Ive got a thing about places like this I
know what those houses are like I know what

JAMES LEER

clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a
bad debt

GRADY

JAMES LEER
When we fall we fall hard

GRADY
Amazing

GRADY takes the joint from the ashtray lights it then
notices-with surprise--James has his hand out

GRADY (contd)
I thought you were the guy who didnt like to
lose control of his emotions

JAMES LEER
Maybe I just needed the moment to present
itself

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD (KINSHIP) - DAY (ONE HOUR LATER)

GRADY glides down the graceful tree-lined streets of a
modest but well-kept neighborhood James still has the
JOINT-now only a tiny nub-pinched between his fingers

JAMES LEER
This is so nice Its like where Andy Hardy

Nothing As he turns away GRADY sees James sitting on the
hood of the Galaxie with the box of powdered donuts Hes
sitting in the indentation

JAMES LEER
Someone jumped on your car with their butt -

GRADY

JAMES LEER
You can see the outline of a butt

As GRADY nods James holds out the donut box

JAMES LEER (contd)
Want one Theyre incredible Incredible

GRADY

58 EXT BACK PORCH - BACK YARD (MOMENTS LATER)
As GRADY steps onto the back porch James follows

JAMES LEER

GRADY

meantime I need you to shimmy through

James stares at the Doggy Door cut into the back porch
door

GRADY
Relax Emily hasnt carried a house key since
she was twelve years old And your hips are as
slim as hers

JAMES LEER
Its not that It just reminded me of-- you
know-of whats in the car In the trunk

GRADY
(a pang of guilt himself)
Oh Right Well lets try not to think about
that

James takes another sad glance at the little door then
drops onto ail fours

INT LIVING ROOM - WINTERS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

GRADY leads James through the house Everything about it
speaks of family Even the furniture seems arranged so that
people will gather together light a fire talk

JAMES LEER
It feels really good here

GRADY
I know Its the house you want to wake up in
on Christmas morning
(moving off)
Make yourself at home Ill be right back

INT UPSTAIRS BEDROOM 60

Grady laboring badly on his ankle enters and finds a
DUFFEL BAG open on the floor its contents a tangle of
quickly-packed clothes Everything else in the room feels
of another time PHOTOGRAPHS are everywhere documenting a
PRETTY GIRLS life from first recital to cap and gown

One photograph lies face down GRADY turns it over and
finds the pretty girl grown into a beautiful young woman
standing in a white gown next to a younger Grady--on their
wedding day

INT DEN

James enters FRENCH ROLL in hand and sees a REMOTE

SCREEN TELEVISION imbedded in the opposite wall and
seconds later GEORGE SANDERS walks into his CLOSE-UP

GEORGE SANDERS

Gray All influence is immoral

Hank Winters emerges from the bathroom with a roll of
tape a bottle of alcohol and some cotton wool

HANK
Well its infected I can tell you that Im
just going to clean it up a bit Its up to you
to-find someone who knows what theyre doing
Here Put your foot up

GRADY puts his foot up on Hanks lazy-Boy then notices a
BOOK lying face down on the seat The AUTHOR on the back
cover looks as if hes trying very hard to look
consequential To his surprise GRADY realizes the author
is himself

HANK
So hes one of your students this boy

GRADY glances into the living room where James and Irene
sit on a long couch together sipping something hot James
is looking out the window a curious expression on his
face GRADY looks out his own window sees the Newfoundland
sniffing curiously at-the Galaxies trunk When he glances
back into the living room he and James make brief eye
contact then blink look away

GRADY
Yes Hes a good kid Maybe a little messed
up
HANK
Well Im sure with the proper guidance hell
be fine

GRADY tries to read Hanks face---is he messing with
him--but Hank gives nothing away GRADY nods to the book

GRADY
What made you pull out that old thing

HANK
(shrugging)
I was thinking of you

GRADY
And

HANK
Its no Arsonists Daughter but I guess you
know that Its a young mans book It got me
remembering how it felt to be young

GRADY
Maybe I should read it

HANK
Oh I dont think theres any danger of you
aging prematurely Grady

GRADY doesnt have to read Hanks face this time

GRADY
Wheres Emily Hank

HANK
I dont know if shed want me to tell you
that Grady

GRADY

HANK

GRADY

GRADY
(sheepishly)
Oh Right Linda I havent been doing a lot
of sleeping lately My editors in town and I
have the book to finish and--

HANK
Ah right The book

starts to continue then stops cowed by something

in Hanks tone something dismissive Instead he looks

away
again

GRADY

toward the living room and catches sight of James
sitting alone now with his big cup of cocoa

GRADY
Listen Hank Im sorry about ail this I
didnt come here to upset you and Irene I want
you to know that

HANK
Why did you come here Grady

gestures vaguely

GRADY
I -just wanted to see her I guess-- Emily
And to see you too-you and Irene And to let
everyone know that even though it may be
difficult to comprehend now this-everything
thats happening-its not forever It doesnt
mean Goodbye

HANK

Hank snaps off the tape slaps Gradys ankle

HANK
Youre done

INT GALAXIE - MOVING - DUSK 71

GRADY glowers darkly at the road then puts his hand up
against the HEATING VENT which apparently is not putting
out any heat

JAMES LEER
Im having a really good time Professor
Tripp

GRADY glances over sees James burrowing into the Ziploc

GRADY
Im really happy for you James But do me a
favor will you Lay off my dope That stuffs
not for amateurs

James looks at Ziploc as GRADY fiddles with the heat
LEVER

JAMES LEER
I just wanted a little sip

GRADY
(squinting at him)
I just wanted a little sip Tell me James
exactly what point was it that you turned into
Serpent Boy

JAMES LEER
Probably about the time you gave me the
codeine pills last night

GRADY stops with the heater glances over at James whose
face bears not the slightest trace of irony

GRADY

Jesus

(thinking then )
Look James you appear to possess-like many
an aspiring writer before you by the way-a
rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which
dreams are made However I think its best
if for the moment at least

(taking the Ziploc)

we abstain

JAMES LEER
Youre mad at me arent you

GRADY
What
JAMES LEER
Youre mad because I shot your girlfriends
dog

GRADY
It wasnt her dog Its her husbands--
(stopping)
Who said anything about girlfriend

James eyes shift slowly as if to say Who are you
kidding

GRADY
Okay James I wish you hadnt shot my
girlfriends dog Even though Poe and I werent
exactly what youd call simpatico thats no
reason for him to take two in the chest Still
the fact remains that Im the one who took you
up into the Chancellors bedroom Im the one
who has to take the blame I- dont know what
the hell I was thinking

JAMES LEER
Sure you do You were thinking Thats no cap
gun in that kids overcoat You were thinking
IT cant let that kid get on the bus alone-he
might never get on the bus again You were
thinking Ive got to find a way to distract
this kid So you did It was--in its way--a
noble act

GRADY
Thanks for the halo James but Ive never
done that much thinking ahead in my life-ever

James looks -out the window pondering this

JAMES LEER
So why did you take me up there

GRADY
(feeling for the heat again)
I -don t know James I don t know why I do
half the things I do Who does
(looking over)
Why do you wear that coat

James looks down a little defensive

JAMES LEER
Its warm
GRADY
James fall semester first day of class it
was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat

James just blinks no ready answer-available

James

GRADY
Thats why they all give you such a hard time
in workshop

JAMES LEER
Because of my coat

GRADY
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the
time Not to mention the fact that every last
one of them is jealous of you

JAMES LEER

(smirking)
Jealous Of me

GRADY
Not you Your talent

face hardens He looks away

JAMES LEER
Youre lying

GRADY
The hell I am

JAMES LEER

Yes you are My stuff stinks I know it You
said so yourself

GRADY
I never said that

JAMES LEER
Yes you did Last night To your friend
Crabtree Is he any good he said And you
said Not yet he isnt I heard you myself

GRADY
I didnt mean it that way

JAMES LEER
Its okay Professor Tripp Carrie Howard
the others--they re right My stories are
annoying They go on and on and on and the
longer they go on the more annoying they
become until finally you just want to grab
something heavy and--

GRADY
Shut up James Youre annoying Carrie and
Howard dont know what the fuck theyre talking
about okay The entire class combined-
including the lovely Hannah Green-has about one
tenth of one percent the talent you have okay

James stares blankly at Grady then turns his face to the
window He ponders Gradys words the praise inherent in
them A hint of pleasure glints in his eyes

JAMES LEER
But last night

GRADY
Who cares what- I said last night James I I
was drunk I was stoned Id been bitten by a
dog My wife had left me How bout cutting me
some slack

JAMES LEER
(quietly)
Im sorry

GRADY
And dont be so goddamn sensitive Who cares
what anybody thinks anyway You want to be a
good writer You want to be-a great writer
Then stop giving a damn what other people
think Most of them havent thought in years

James turns studies Gradys face as it flickers in the
first headlights of the evening

GRADY
Let me spell it out for you James Books
dont mean anything Not to anybody Not
anymore

JAMES LEER
Arsonists Daughter meant something

GRADY smiles contemptuously
JAMES LEER

I mean it It means something to me Its one
of the reasons I came to school here To be in
your class To be taught by you

(quietly)
Its one of the reasons I wanted to become a
writer

GRADY stares ahead watching the darkness tumble away
before the wide sweep of the Galaxies headlights

GRADY
Well for that if nothing else James Im
sorry

GRADY rolls into a space near the coffee shop and James
slides out GRADY
stays put hands still on the wheel

JAMES LEER
You coming

GRADY
In a minute Get us a table

James nods pushes past the glass doors into the coffee
shop and a big REDHEAD in a waitress cap leads him to a
table with a view of the highway GRADY

watches James-- stick figure in black brogues--slide into
the booth and open his big laminated menu

Finally as if concluding some internal debate GRADY
kicks open his door steps out

GRADY rests his forehead against the PAYPHONE as he
speaks

Never mind My mistake

The remains of a FRIED CLAM SANDWICH sit before James as
he turns his attention to a GIANT PIECE OF LEMON MERINGUE

that whip by on the highway beyond the window

JAMES LEER

JAMES LEER

GRADY

James shrugs spears a fluffy chunk of pie

JAMES LEER
Its because you dont eat

GRADY

GRADY
When nobodys looking

GRADY watches a pair of headlights approach

JAMES LEER
(mouth full garbled)
I just worry about you thats all

at him

GRADY
You just worry about yourself James Okay

JAMES LEER
Okay

Just then a long pale WAND of LIGHT splinters against
the coffee shop windows and a CAR sweeps into the parking
lot GRADY follows it with his eyes rises

JAMES LEER (contd)
Where you going

GRADY
Nowhere You just sit here and eat

GRADY moves off then stops looking back at James and
his giant piece of pie still troubled by his words

EXT COFFEE SHOPMOTEL

As GRADY limps out of the coffee shop he finds an OLDER

We were able to put in an appearance

FRED LEER
Otherwise we wouldve been here earlier

GRADY
Ah Well thats ail right James and I had a
little dinner

FRED LEER
Well certainly well reimburse you

GRADY
Thats not necessary I just felt it might
be good for James to be with his family this
weekend

FRED LEER

Well of course we can understand that

GRADY considers the two glittering ghosts before him
They seem to be waiting Just waiting

GRADY
Well Let me go get him

GRADY turns for the coffee shop then stops looks back
GRADY (contd)
I hope you wont consider this forward of me

Amanda but I wonder if I might ask did you
ever attend Catholic school

Amanda Leers eyes narrow ever-so-slightly

AMANDA LEER
Excuse me

James is glowering at the parking lot as GRADY returns

JAMES LEER
Im not going with them

GRADY
James Listen Things-things are a little
weird with me right now and I-- well--I have
enough blame to shoulder these days without
having to take the blame if something bad
happened to you And if you hang around me long
enough something bad is going to happen trust
me Thats why I need you to go home
Understand

JAMES LEER
Im not going with them

GRADY
James like it or not theyre your parents

JAMES LEER
Parents Theyre not my parents Theyre my
grandparents My parents are dead

GRADY stares at-James wearily

JAMES LEER
I swear My father had his own airplane he
used to fly up to Quebec One Christmas he and
my mom were flying up to our house in the
Laurentians when the plane went down It was in
the newspaper

GRADY doesnt flinch unpersuaded

JAMES LEER
I swear My father was a senior vice
president at Dravo My mother was a socialite
Her maiden name was Guggenheim

GRADY starts to protest then pauses

GRADY
I remember that Five or six years ago

JAMES LEER
Six Their plane went down right outside
Scranton

GRADY
(sardonically)
Near Carvel

JAMES LEER
Im sorry about all that I just-I dont like
to talk about my family They treat me like a
freak
(nodding towards Amanda)

She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house Its
mine My parents left it to me

GRADY glances toward the parking lot studies the
contours of Fred Leers face Frowns

GRADY
James come on That man is obviously your
father You look just like him

James looks down at the table takes a deep breath and
speaks in a voice heavy with implication

JAMES LEER
Theres a reason for that

Gradys addled brain grapples with this dark little
riddle finally deciphers what James is suggesting

GRADY
Get out of here

JAMES LEER
Thats why she hates me Thats why she makes
me sleep in the basement

GRADY
In the crawl space with the rats and the
casks of Amontillado Come on Up

As GRADY lifts him from the booth James attempts a
plaintive tone but his hearts not in it

JAMES LEER
I swear

EXT COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER 78

As Fred Leer SLAMS the back door of the Mercedes GRADY
waves vaguely peers into the darkness of the back seat

FRED LEER

Thank you Professor Tripp

GRADY
Take care of him

AMANDA LEER
Oh dont worry Well take care of him You
can be sure of that

Fred Leer hits the gas and swings the Mercedes around in

a tight little arc feathering Gradys pants--from the knee
down--with a pudding of ICE and MUD GRADY glances down at
his spattered self then notices sitting on the front
passenger seat James knapsack GRADY grabs it turns

GRADY
Hey

GRADYS POV - REAR WINDOW

as the Mercedes begins to pull away and James turns

elbows on the back dash his pale face slack Spying Grady
he raises one limp hand and then-as if it were held by a
string-lets it drop

(softly)
Hey

that rains from the PARKING LAMP overhead begins to read

EXT GRADYS HOUSE - NIGHT (LATER) 80

Gradys HOUSE looks like a three-dollar whore on a block
full of nuns MUSIC BLARES LIGHT BLAZES from every window
and there are so many CARS GRADY is forced to leave the

INT GRADYS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

INT GRADYS OFFICE

Hannah Green sits on the sofa twisting a long strand of
hair around her finger as she reads a THICK MANUSCRIPT

GRADY
(entering)
Hey

HANNAH GREEN

She slaps the page she is reading back onto the stack at
her thigh GRADY
stares The manuscript Its his

HANNAH GREEN
(embarrassed)
I know I shouldnt have but there it was
just sort of lying out and I couldnt resist
and-and--I suck

GRADY
No its okay I just cant believe I left it
out in the open like that CRABTREE hasnt been
in here has he Poking around

HANNAH GREEN
I dont know--maybe- I dont think so

Gradys mind races with unfortunate possibilities but
only briefly his immediate thoughts are elsewhere

GRADY
Listen Hannah You dont remember where that
aunt worked do you James aunt

HANNAH GREEN
He shot the Chancellors dog didnt he The
blind one

GRADY
Actually Hes not the Chancellor s--What

HANNAH GREEN
At first the police thought he just ran away
but this afternoon Dr Gaskell found some blood
spots on the carpet -
GRADY

HANNAH GREEN
CRABTREE said it sounded like something James
would be messed up in

GRADY
Crabtree He doesnt even know James

HANNAH GREEN
Who does

Just then Crabtrees VOICE bellows in the hallway
outside

CRABTREE (0S)

GRADY looks anxiously toward the door
GRADY

As GRADY starts to turn away Hannah hooks her finger
inside his belt buckle

HANNAH GREEN

GRADY looks at Hannahs hand where it rests He looks
terrified
GRADY
Listen Hannah Im flattered really but

CRABTREE
(bursting in)
Tripp where the hell

CRABTREE stops takes in the tableau before him
CRABTREE (contd)
Oh Im sorry Am I interrupting a student-

teacher conference

GRADY delicately removes Hannahs hand from his buckle
points at Crabtree

GRADY
You stay there

CRABTREE
What Ohhhh Is that it

CRABTREE cocks his head toward the reams of paper stacked
on Gradys desk

CRABTREE
Honestly Tripp Do you actually think I would
sneak in here and read your book without asking
you

GRADY
Gee I dont know Crabs I dont seem to
remember you actually asking me if you could
invite 200 people over to trash my living room

CRABTREE
Sometimes we have to improvise

GRADY
(ignoring him)
Think Hannah Does James have any friends I
mean besides you and me

CRABTREE
James My James Whats happened

GRADY
Nothing hes just been sort of I dont
know kidnapped

CRABTREE
Kidnapped By who

GRADY
His parents

CRABTREE
Good God Lets go rescue him

GRADY
Good idea Crabs Only one problem I dont

CRABTREE
Ah Wait a minute The university must know

GRADY
Maybe I dont know

HANNAH GREEN

GRADY and CRABTREE turn see Hannah sitting on the corner
of Gradys desk with the WHITE PAGES open on her lap

HANNAH GREEN (contd)
Theyre in the book

INT GALAXIE - MOVING - TEN MINUTES LATER
CRABTREE snaps James manuscript closed

CRABTREE
You know--based on what Ive read-- this is a
very exciting piece of material this Big
Parade

GRADY
Love Its Love facade--and what do you mean
based on what youve read You skimmed two
chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling
methamphetamines

CRABTREE
Ive been doing this a long time Tripp I
feel this kid in my bones
GRADY
Only in your bones

GRADY smirks glances at Crabtree but gets a surprise
CRABTREE offers no snappy come-back no antic wordplay He
just stares out the window his voice distant

CRABTREE
No I think I might be right Ive felt it
before

As Crabtrees voice trails off GRADY studies him

GRADY
How bad is it for you

CRABTREE
Bad enough And God knows I dont exactly fit
the new corporate profile

GRADY
Which is
CRABTREE

Competence

GRADY and CRABTREE look at each other a moment then
CRABTREE smiles gives a little shrug and picks up James
knapsack rummaging through the contents

CRABTREE (contd)
So tell me about you and the Chancellor

GRADY
Whats to tell

CRABTREE
Plenty Im sure But for what its worth

CRABTREE fishes out the biography of Erroll Flynn gives
it a look

CRABTREE
I like her

GRADY peers at the stars his voice barely audible

GRADY

This is it

EXT LEER HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Grady--limping like an aging prizefighter--leads CRABTREE
up a steep incline toward an enormous three-story house
The Leers Mercedes gleams in the shadows

CRABTREE

GRADY
I told you They keep him chained in the
basement Come on

EXT REAR - LEER HOUSE

LIGHT GLOWS from a low BASEMENT WINDOW From one side a
WOMAN is HEARD SINGING GRADY and CRABTREE pause listen

Why should I care though he gave me the air
Why should I cry heave a sigh and wonder why
And wonder why

CRABTREE

CRABTREE and GRADY look at each other

GRADY CRABTREE
James Leer

GRADY moves to the window and RAPS on the glass A moment
later James peeks out Seeing Grady his face brightens
briefly unguarded then quickly resumes its usual Leerian
aspect He motions with his hand as if to say That way

EXT BASEMENT DOOR

The DOOR swings open to reveal James Leer decked out in
a pair of RED INK-STAINED PAJAMAS sagging badly in the
seat He looks like one of Santas elves

JAMES LEER
Hey What are you guys doing here

CRABTREE
Were springing you Leer Get some pants on

As they step inside GRADY gives James PJs the once-
over

GRADY
I cant believe you made fun of my robe

INT JAMES ROOM - BASEMENT 87

Electric CANDELABRAS light a large converted cellar whose
walls are crowded with MOVIE POSTERS and LOBBY CARDS There
are STACKS of what look suspiciously like LIBRARY BOOKS and
an enormous BAROQUE BED complete with CANOPY

CRABTREE
I like what youve done with it Whens
Captain Nemo moving in

JAMES LEER
The candelabras were my Grans

GRADY
Oh Christ dont start on ol Gran or well

CRABTREE
Hey I heard all about it--the parents the
grandparents the China town thing-- and I
believe you okay Thats why were here Now

James scoops up the shirt GRADY lent him this morning
JAMES LEER
Can I--I mean--do you mind--if I wear this

again Professor Tripp

GRADY
Ah wear whatever you want

James flinches stung then disappears into a bathroom

CRABTREE
So modest

GRADY
So sensitive
CRABTREE
(nosing around the room)
Oh come on Tripp Cut the kid some slack

GRADY
Its just ail that crap he spins out Just
once Id like to know if the little bastard is
telling the truth

CRABTREE
The-truth I know thats always been real
important to you Key check this out

CRABTREE leans over an old ROYAL TYPEWRITER reads from
the freshly-typed PAGE curling from the carriage

CRABTREE
Finally the door opened It-was a shock to
see him shuffling into the room like an aging
prizefighter Limping Beaten
(with an amused smile)
Sound like anyone we know
(resuming)
But it was later when the great man squinted
into the bitter glow or twilight
(frowning)
Bitter glow of twilight This kid definitely
needs an editor
(resuming)
and muttered simply It means nothing All of it
Nothing that the true shock came It was then that the
boy understood that his heros true injuries lay hidden in
a darker place His heart

CRABTREE stops abruptly

GRADY
Yes His heart
CRABTREE hesitates then reads on
CRABTREE

His heart once capable of inspiring others
so completely could no longer inspire so much
as itself It beat now only out of habit It
beat now only because it could

GRADY nods his face unreadable then James returns

JAMES LEER
Im ready

James stops sees the two men looking at him

JAMES LEER
You all right Professor Tripp

CRABTREE
Hes great Come on lets blow before ol
Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast

JAMES LEER
Oh well thats just it Shes been coming
down here every half hour or so to sort of

check on me If Im not here she might call
the police or something
CRABTREE

Hhhuh So we decoy her Stick a couple pillows
and one of your teddy bears under the spread
and she wont know the difference

JAMES LEER
(brightening)
Yeah Like in Against All Flags Only they use
a couple big hams

GRADY
No

CRABTREE and James turn

GRADY
Ive got something better than a teddy bear

CUT TO POE -- as hes lowered delicately onto James
bed

INT JAMES ROOM - BASEMENT (A FEW MINUTES LATER)

GRADY strategically arranges the coverlet gently
adjusting Poes head so only a TUFT of FUR shows He steps
back joining CRABTREE and James for an assessment

GRADY
Sweet dreams Jimmy

alone the bossa nova floating softly in the air

INT HANNAHS ROOM

Hannah Green lies tangled in the sheets surrounded by
little colonies of Gradys manuscript GRADY studies her
then detects something on the floor The red boots

Delicately he lifts the sheet Hannah Greens feet--
finally revealed in ail their naked glory--prove to be
thick wide and ordinary GRADY

sighs

EXT PORCH - GRADYS HOUSE - NIGHT (A BIT LATER)

GRADY sits quietly on the porch steps a joint burning in
his fingers To his left perched atop a Haagen-Dazs
container is a TELEPHONE As he pulls it into his lap a
LAMP in the living room pirouettes clumsily spins free of
the cord and SHATTERS on the floor

GRADY blinks looks away and DIALS just as the
CLATTERING COUGH of an ENGINE is HEARD and a VAN appears
Stenciled on its side panel is

Kravniks Sporting Goods

The van slows almost coasting then abruptly bursts past
Gradys house and disappears around the corner GRADY
frowns then realizes a MANS VOICE is coming from the

Sara leans down replaces the uncradled phone

SARA (contd)
with your phone Unfortunately mine was
ringing loud and clear this morning

GRADY doesnt know what this means but hes pretty sure

GRADY
Oh

SARA
It seems one of our students is - missing and

GRADY
(slumping to the porch)
Im sorry Sara Ive been trying to tell you
Its all my-

Sara raises her hand silencing him

SARA
Im not very happy with you right now Grady
But more importantly Walters not very happy
and hes gotten the police involved They seem
to think James Leer is somehow responsible for
all of this You wouldnt happen to know where
James is would you Grady

GRADY
Inside

SARA
And the jacket

GRADY

Over there In the backseat of the

Gradys hand hangs in mid-air gesturing pointlessly to

stain roughly the shape of North Dakota

Grady
GRADY
Honestly Someone stole my car I parked it
right there last night

SARA
Are you sure you parked it there

GRADY
Of course Im sure Ah Christ the puberty

SARA
Ill deal with this You dig up James

INT CRABTREES ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

CRABTREE sits in bed flipping through the pages of The
Love Parade while stroking a tiny TUFT of HAIR that is the
sole visible part of James Leer

GRADY
(swinging in)
Is he awake

CRABTREE
Im afraid hes pretty worn out poor kid

GRADY
Nevertheless Theres a police officer
standing on the porch and I dont think hes
going away

JAMES LEER
(from under the covers)
That same guy

CRABTREE peels back the blankets and James Leer opens one
eye

JAMES LEER
You snore

CRABTREE
So I hear

JAMES LEER

(studying Grady)
No offense Professor Tripp but you look
sorta crappy
CRABTREE
Hes right you look horrible

GRADY
Thank you Frankie and Annette

James swings his pale little legs to the floor and walks
bare assed across the room to retrieve his BVDs

JAMES LEER
Its the Chancellor

CRABTREE
Ah right Well I gave you my opinion

GRADY
And we both thank you for that but were
were fine

JAMES LEER
Im fine right Fit as a fucking fiddle

GRADY squints at James as he pulls on his pants

GRADY
Shut up James

CRABTREE
So whats the problem

GRADY
(a tad tense)
There is no problem Did I say there was a
problem

As James head pops through Gradys fully-buttoned
flannel he and CRABTREE

exchange a knowing glance at once referring to and
excluding Grady

SARA (0 S)
Hows it coming back there Professor Tripp

CRABTREE
Whos that

GRADY
Who do you think it is

CRABTREE
The Chancellors here Now

GRADY

Evidently

GRADY

Its Walters dog and yes she does Know But
lets spare her the details Come on your
shoes are in the hail

CRABTREE
James This book of yours Its not bad Not
bad at all

James stops considers this piece of news with a look of
deep seriousness then nods

JAMES LEER
Thank you

CRABTREE
Youre welcome

As James shuffles off into the hail CRABTREE looks at
Grady his eyes dancing with excitement

CRABTREE
I want to publish this Ive got to I think
theyll let me With a little editorial
guidance it could be brilliant

GRADY
Great Between you and Officer Pupcik out
there he can be the next Jean Genet Its been
awhile since somebody wrote a good book in
jail

EXT GRADYS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Sara and GRADY stand by as Pete Pupcik deposits James in
the back of the squad car SLAMS the door

PUPCIK

As I told the Chancellor Professor Im just going to
run James here over to the university Itll be up to Dr
Gaskell where we go from there

GRADY nods leans in the window to James
GRADY
Dont worry James Ill figure something out

JAMES LEER
Im not worried Youre not worried are you
Professor Tripp

GRADY
Im a little worried James

JAMES LEER
Dont be I dont care if they expel me I
probably should be expelled

GRADY
Well lets see if we can keep that from
happening

James nods and GRADY starts to step back from the car

JAMES LEER
Professor Tripp

GRADY
Yes James

JAMES LEER

Even if I end up going to jail
James smiles his crooked grin

JAMES LEER (contd)
Youre still the best teacher I ever had

On this Pete Pupcik pulls away leaving GRADY standing
on the curb watching the back of James head framed in
the rear window of the police car growing smaller

SARA
This is not what the university has in mind
when it promises a liberal education Grady

GRADY
Would Walter really press charges

SARA
Its within the realm He takes his souvenirs
pretty seriously And he was just a wee bit
prickly this morning

Grady detecting something in Saras tone turns watches
her take a drag on her cigarette

SARA (contd)
You didnt happen to call the house last
night did you Grady

GRADY
I think I might have

SARA
And what do you think you might have said

GRADY
I think I mightve said I was in love with
you

Saras face remains unchanged

GRADY (contd)
He told you

SARA
He told me

GRADY
And what did you say

SARA
I said it didnt sound like you

Sara tosses her cigarette in the gutter gets into her
car and dives away GRADY looks after her sadly then
turns sees CRABTREE standing on the porch wearing a shirt
which claims Ativan Chases the Clouds Away

CRABTREE
So- what do we do now

GRADY
Find the jacket

CRABTREE
Oh huh Exactly how do we do that

GRADY
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her
car

CRABTREE

It seems to me that girl would let you borrow
her pancreas

INT HANNAHS ROOM
Hannah wrapped loosely in cotton sheets SMILES as she
listens to the Goatee Kid who sits cross-legged at the
foot of-her bed fully clothed

GOATEE KID
Im telling you the tango is ail about latent
homosexual love Look at the way they dance--
its sodomy

HANNAH GREEN
(laughing)
Stop it

Hannah looks up sees GRADY in the doorway and blushes
She pulls the sheet up gives an oddly formal wave

HANNAH GREEN
Grady Hi Whats up

Jeff eases off the bed past GRADY uneasily

GOATEE KID
Ill be somewhere else

GRADY
Hey Jeff If youre really interested in
discussing that business with the tango try
the guy at the end of the hall

Jeff nods--puzzled--then goes GRADY smirks

GRADY
He cribbed that from Borges

HANNAH GREEN
It beats Whats your major

GRADY nods detecting a new aloofness in her voice

GRADY
Right Anyway I was wondering if I could
borrow your car Mines sort of out of
commission

HANNAH GREEN
Sure The keys are on the dresser next to
to your book

The hitch in Hannahs voice hangs in the room like a
cloud

I uh

That

No its not that

HANNAH GREEN
I didnt finish I fell asleep

GRADY

good hub

HANNAH GREEN
its

Hannah glances at the huge stack of paper sitting on her

dresser then hesitantly looks back to Grady
HANNAH GREEN
Its just that you know I was thinking about
how in class youre always telling us -that

writers make choices--at least the good ones

And
book

but at times its

know

dont get me wrong Im not saying the
isnt really great-I mean really great-
well very detailed you
with the genealogies of everyones horses

and ail the dental records and so on-and I

dont know

maybe Im wrong but it sort of

reads in places like well actually like
(with trepidation)
you didnt make any choices at all And I was
wondering if it might not be different if maybe when you
wrote you werent always under the influence
GRADY
(stung)
Hh huh Well thanks for the thought but as

shocking as this may sound

Im not the first

Hannah nods
ridiculous

writer to sip a little weed And furthermore
it might interest you to know that one book I
wrote as you say ‘under the influence
happened to win a little something called the
PEN award which by the way I accepted under
the influence

averts her eyes
He starts to say something

and immediately GRADY feels

his manuscript and exits
INT LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

CRABTREE

CRABTREE sucks on a Kool driving Hannahs rattling

clothes the Wonder Boys manuscript sitting like a
watermelon on his lap-looking all in all fairly pathetic

CRABTREE
Let me get this straight Jerry Nathan owes
you money So as collateral he gives you his

GRADY
Only now Im starting to think the car wasnt
exactly Jerrys to give

CRABTREE
So whose car is it

GRADY
My guess-Vernon Hardapple

CRABTREE
The hood jumper

GRADY
He said a few things that lead me to believe
the cars his

CRABTREE
Such as

GRADY

Thats my car motherfucker

CRABTREE
Hh hub So We find Vernon we find the car
We find the car

GRADY peers into the backseat squinting against the WIND

and frowns at the ZIPLOC of Humboldt County He pockets it
anyway then spies something else

As GRADY lolls behind the steering wheel a CLOUD
appears hovering then slowly mutates and GRADY realizes
its not a cloud at all its

MARILYN MONROE standing by the side mirror wearing a
bright pink dress under her wedding jacket

MARILYN
I know you

Marilyns face swims before Gradys eyes but theres
something wrong with it This girls eyes are brown and
besides shes fat

MARILYN (contd)
Double Dickel on the rocks

The last of the fairy dust evaporates and GRADY finds-
standing before him in a pink jersey dress and Marilyn
Monroes wedding jacket--Oola the pregnant waitress from
the Hi-Hat Club

GRADY
Oola

OOLA
I never forget a drink

GRADY
I never forget an Oola

Suddenly there is a HEAVY CLICK

MANS VOICE (0S)
Forget me

GRADY starts to turn but his head wont move largely
because the BARREL of a GERMAN NINE is pressed to his
temple Gradys eyes slide

GRADY
Vernon

VERNON
(to Oola)
Move away cupcake Hes got a gun
GRADY
Whos got a gun

VERNON
Youve got a gun motherfucker Drop it

GRADY
Relax Vernon

OOLA
Whys he calling you Vernon

VERNON
Whys he sitting in my car Hes crazy thats
why He probably calls everybody Vernon

GRADY
Not true Youre the only Vernon I know
Actually Im wrong I once knew a Vernon
Peabody at Penguin UK

VERNON
Shut up
(to Oola)
Cupcake Please Inside

OOLA
You re not going to shoot him are you
VERNON
Im going to shoot him If he doesnt put that
gun down
GRADY

Its just a souvenir They dont even make the
caps anymore

VERNON
Bullshit I know a gun when I see one And
thats a gun

GRADY
No really

GRADY lifts his arm points the little pearl-handled
pistol to the DARK CLOUDS overhead

107 INT HANNAHS RENAULT

CRABTREE jumps as the tiny pistol at the end of Gradys
arm FLASHES makes a FEEBLE POP in the wind

CRABTREE
Holy shit

EXT KRAVNIKS
Vernon stands half-hunched stunned

VERNON
Are you crazy

The gunshot seems to have cleared Gradys head He stares
at the gun watches Vernon wrest it from his hand

VERNON (contd)
Get out Whats the matter with you Cant you
see the condition my girls in

As GRADY gets out of the car Vernon places his hand on
Oolas tummy

VERNON
You all right cupcake

OOLA
Whos Vernon

A rude SQUEAL breaks the silence--rubber scratching
asphalt--and Grady Oola and Vernon turn to see Hannah
Greens rattling Renault lurching awkwardly toward them

VERNON
What the

Gears GRINDING tires smoking CRABTREE fish-tails
wildly then kicks open the passenger door

CRABTREE
Tripp Run

GRADY doesnt move an inch watching in mute amazement as
CRABTREE whistles by proceeds halfway down the block then
turns back for another pass

VERNON
Who the hell is that

GRADY
A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon

girls clutch

The car bucks crazily picks up speed and Crabtree--

swiping aside a flutter of MANUSCRIPT PAGES that have taken
flight inside the car--begins to veer right toward Grady
Vernon and Oola

VERNON
Woah

Vernon steps into the street levels the German Nine

VERNON (contd)
Pull off you crazy motherfucker

Frantic GRADY steps between Vernon the German Nine and
the oncoming Crabtree

GRADY
No Dont shoot Hes just a lousy driver

CRABTREE fans the wheel wildly goes into a slide and the
passenger door snaps wide releasing what looks to be a
FLOCK OF WHITE DOVES into the wind-whipped sky

A

Only these aint birds « -

GRADY
Oh my God

These are PAGES Seven years of-pages

CRABTREE goes into another slide one-hops the curb and
smashes flat into the weathered GLOVE of BILL MAZEROSKI
painted on the front wail of KRAVNIKS SPORTING GOODS

As Hannah Greens RADIATOR EXPLODES CRABTREE steps free

of the car and looks skyward Its a ticker-tape parade ail
the way down the street ending in the frigid waters of the
Ohio River

GRADY (contd)
(to Vernon)
I take it back Shoot him

INT GALAXIE - MOVING

Vernon drives Oola at his side In-the back CRABTREE
puffs philosophically on a Kool while GRADY sits grimly
with the sad remains of his manuscript SEVEN RUMPLED
PAGES one of which bears the watermark of a shoe print

CRABTREE
Naturally you have copies
GRADY
I have an alternate version of the first
chapter

CRABTREE
Youll be all right then Look at Carlyle
when he lost his luggage

GRADY
That was MacCaulay

CRABTREE
Or Hemingway when Hadley lost all those
stories

GRADY

He was never able to reproduce them

CRABTREE
Bad examples Look Tripp I dont want to
depreciate the loss here but perhaps--in a
sense- this--
(nodding to the pages)
is for the best

Gradys eyes shift study Crabtree

GRADY
Kind of a sign youre saying

CRABTREE
In a sense

GRADY
I dont think so In my experience signs are
usually a lot more subtle

VERNON
Let me get this straight All that paper that
went into the river That was the only copy

GRADY
Fraid so

VERNON
(glowering at Crabtree)
And youre saying its some kind of sign What
the fucks the matter with you

CRABTREE
Im just saying that sometimes
subconsciously a person will put themselves in
a situation-perhaps even create that situation-
in order to have an arena in which to work out
an unresolved issue Its a covert way if you
will of addressing a problem

Vernon stares at CRABTREE as if hes from another planet

VERNON
Ill tell you the problem You behind the
wheel Theres your fucking problem

CRABTREE
Thats pretty simplistic dont you think

VERNON
Hey pal you dont start doing crazy eights
in the middle of the street none of this
happens

CRABTREE
Excuse me Did you or did you not have a gun
to his head

VERNON
He was trying to steal my car

GRADY
Ail right all right Its done Theres no
need to talk about it Its done

They ride in silence for a moment then Oola turns
glances at GRADY
and his little sheaf of pages

OOLA
So what was it about
(as GRADY looks up)
Your book What was the story

GRADY stares into Oolas sweet brown eyes

GRADY
I dont know

Oolas brow wrinkles CRABTREE glances at his old friend
genuine compassion in his eyes

CRABTREE
What he means is its difficult to distill
the essence of a book sometimes It-lives in
the mind
VERNON
Yeah but you gotta know what its about
right I mean if you didnt know what it was
about why were you writing it

GRADY
I couldnt stop

110 EXT CAMPUS ENTRANCE

Grady James Leers hollow knapsack in hand stands with
CRABTREE at the campus entrance as Vernon and Oola prepare
to leave in the Galaxie

GRADY
Hey Vernon Can I ask you a question

VERNON
Shoot

GRADY glances at little round Oola

GRADY
Boy or girl

VERNON
As long as it looks like her I dont care
You know what Im saying

GRADY watches Vernon give Oola a kiss on the forehead

GRADY
Right Well thanks For the lift

VERNON
No sweat Only do me a favor

GRADY
Sure

VERNON
Stop calling me Vernon

CRABTREE leans into Grady WHISPERS

CRABTREE
The jacket Tripp We need the jacket

GRADY (contd)
Oh right Oola About that jacket
OOLA
Yea

GRADY looks at the waitress in her pink jersey dress
snuggled up in the silk wedding jacket

GRADY
It used to belong to Marilyn Monroe She had
small shoulders like you Most people dont
know that

As Oola smiles pleased Vernon shakes his head

VERNON
Man that book of yours mustve been one nutty
motherfucking ride

Vernon points an imaginary gun fires a friendly cap into
Grady and pulls away CRABTREE stands stunned

CRABTREE
You mind explaining what you just did

GRADY watches the shrinking Galaxie sail under a drooping
NORDFEST BANNER lost in thought

GRADY
Came to my senses CRABTREE

Ah Well Congratulations Meanwhile what is
James supposed to do Pray for Walter Gaskell
to come to his

GRADY
Walter Gaskell isnt going to send James Leer
to jail Crabs I know that

CRABTREE
Do you know he wont expel him

GRADY
No But I dont think that matters

CRABTREE
Thats very enlightened Professor Its
comforting to know that Americas children have
you for a teacher

GRADY blinks ponders this briefly then looks toward the
buildings of the campus his VOICE still distant

GRADY
Nobody teaches a writer anything You tell

them what you know You tell them to find their
voice and stick with it because thats all you
have in the end You tell the ones who have it
to keep at it and you tell the ones who dont
to keep at it too Because thats the only way
to get where youre going

(ruefully)
Of course it helps if you know where you want
to go

(thoughtfully)

Maybe thats the only thing--that and Sara--
thats made the last seven years worthwhile

GRADY slides James knapsack off his shoulder smiles
cryptically as he considers it -

GRADY (contd)
As for James he doesnt need me anymore

Without warning GRADY tosses CRABTREE the knapsack

GRADY (contd)
Hes got you

CRABTREE stares at the saggy green canvas in his hands
watches GRADY walk away

CRABTREE
Me What can do

GRADY

Gee I dont know Crabs
(over his shoulder)

Improvise Youre good at that

GRADY continues on leaving CRABTREE to stand alone as
he walks toward the buildings in the distance

CRABTREE
Im sorry Tripp

GRADY stops turns

GRADY
You peeked didnt you

CRABTREE
I peeked

GRADY considers this Nods It-doesnt seem to matter
anymore

CRABTREE
It really had the makings Tripp There was a
lot to admire Ive never read anything
quite like it

If there was a Kentucky Derby for editorial bullshit
Crabtrees last three utterances would finish win place
and show And GRADY knows it

GRADY
Youre not just trying to make me feel better

CRABTREE looks directly at Grady his old friend

CRABTREE
Scouts honor

CRABTREE and GRADY stare into each others eyes Both are
acutely aware of the subtext of this conversation

GRADY
Well thanks for that Crabs

INT HALLWAY - ENGLISH DEPARTMENT

Dead quiet Gradually STEPS are heard coming from the
stairwell then GRADY limps into view

INT GRADYS CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER
GRADY surveys the room Empty chairs Empty desks

He walks to a WINDOW the same window he stood at two
afternoons ago when reading James Leers story A chill
breeze pitches the fabric of his shirt as he studies the
barren benches and icy walkways of the quad Finally he-
turns away settles behind his desk and reaching into his
pocket removes the seven remaining pages of his
manuscript He considers them then folds them in half
length-wise He continues folding the top right corner
down into a triangle along the first crease

EXT QUAD

A moment Then-from the third floor window-a PAPER
AIRPLANE glides into view soaring then dropping soaring
then dropping again and again graceful as a dove

INT LOBBY - THAW HALL - LATER

GRADY hobbles into the lobby just as one of the

auditorium doors swings open APPLAUSE SWELLS and he spies
Sara standing inside talking to a STUDENT USHER

GRADY
Sara

Sara turns as the door glides shut As GRADY hustles
forward Q wine glass in hand intercepts him

Q
Grady I have to tell you I took another look
at Arsonists Daughter the other night Theres
a description of a bald cypress that left me
breathless

GRADY
(pushing past him)
Thanks Q I felt the same way about the bank
tellers breasts in your last one

INT BACK ROW - AUDITORIUM - THAW HALL

GRADY enters but Sara is gone He picks his way
behind the back row scanning the aisles

GIRLS VOICS
Hey Professor Tripp

Its Carrie McWhirty James tormentor from workshop
GRADY takes another look around then drops into the seat-
next to her

CARRIE MCWHIRTY
If youre looking for Hannah shes on the
aisle

GRADY
No

But GRADY looks anyway Hannah sits a dozen rows down the
aisle hair pulled back in a clip glorious skin gloaming
The Goatee Kid sits close beside her

CARRIE MCWHIRTY
Whos that guy shes with Didnt he used to
be in workshop

GRADY
Jeff He comes from a long line of tango
dancers

INT MAIN STAGE

Walter turns over the last page of-his prepared notes

WALTER
And now as those of you whove been with us
in previous years know we have a tradition of
sorts here at WordFest Im speaking of
course of The Plums

An anticipatory BUZZ sweeps through the audience as
Walter begins to read from a separate list

WALTER
This weekend Susan Lowery of North Braddock
found a publisher for her childrens book The
Loneliest Prawn Susan stand up

INT BACK ROW - THAW HALL

As a CHUBBY WOMAN stands to acknowledge the applause

GRADY cranes his neck searching the sea of seats To his
surprise he finds CRABTREE sitting prominently in the
front row in his shirtsleeves smiling his spookily
complacent smile James is next to him now wearing
CRABTREES METALLIC SPORTS COAT over Gradys flannel shirt

WALTER
And Robert Wilkenson--who many of you know for
his City Beat column in the Post-Gazette--has
found a home with Putnam for his new Three
Rivers thriller Blood Patterns Robert

A SHORT BALDING MAN stands briefly then Walters VOICE
takes a shift in tone

WALTER
Now this next one I think is especially
exciting to announce because it concerns a
student here at the university Our own James
Leer a sophomore in English literature has
found a publisher for his first novel which I
believe is called The Lovely Parade

GRADY blinks leans forward and watches Walter smile
warmly toward the front row CRABTREE gives James a jab in
the ribs and slowly awkwardly James rises Stunned
Carrie McWhirty turns to the GIRL next to her

CARRIE MCWHIRTY
I have a class with him

James hangs-like a scarecrow from a nail waiting as the

APPLAUSE slows then sputters then dies out altogether

CARRIE MCWHIRTY
The guys kind of an alien probe if you know
what I mean

Grady in a last attempt to save James from himself cups
Hi his hands around his mouth

GRADY
Take a bow James

James turns spots GRADY in the back row then-a sheepish
grin on his face--spreads his arms hangs his head and
takes his first sweet public bow

GRADY (contd)
(softly)
Wonder Boy

WALTER
And finally--and perhaps not least
importantly--Terry Crabtree of Bartizan has
also decided to publish my own book--a critical
exploration of the union of Marilyn Monroe and
Joe DiMaggio and its function in American
mythopoetics-which tentatively Ive entitled
The Last American Marriage

Wild obsequious APPLAUSE GRADY smiles cynically
watches Walter take a brief dignified bow of his own

WALTER
Until next year Thank you everyone

The LIGHTS come up As the auditorium empties CRABTREE
shakes Walters hand and Jeff and his goatee escort Hannah
Green down the aisle where she drapes her lovely arms
around James

GRADY watches them ail sitting alone in his row when
suddenly Sara appears over James shoulder She says
something congratulatory turns and exits out a side door
GRADY blinks scrambles up

INT CORRIDOR - THAW HALL - MOMENTS LATER

GRADY bursts into the corridor

GRADY
Sara
Its empty Quiet GRADY pauses Somewhere a HEAVY METAL
DOOR CLOSES GRADY rushes on

119 INT NEW CORRIDOR

Grady limping badly turns a corner and sees a DOOR He
moves to it pushes past

120 INT STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

and finds himself standing in a stairwell He leans

out over the railing peers down Its a steep drop very
steep ending in a small rectangular space a kind of
basement office with VENDING MACHINES PLASTIC CHAIRS and
a COLLAPSIBLE CARD TABLE

GRADY turns back to the door he came through pushes
against it Locked He sighs looks back at the stairs his
ailing ankle then sits He fishes out the Ziploc of-
marijuana considers the perfectly roiled JOINT floating
atop the bag of buds but for once isnt up to it The
SOUND of FOOTSTEPS echoes far below and hopeful theyre
Saras GRADY pulls himself up peers over the railing

Its Traxler with a broom a big plastic bag

GRADY
Yo Traxler

TRAXLER
(looking up)
Hey Professor Tripp

GRADY considers the Ziploc in his hand looks down again

GRADY
Do you get high Sam

TRAXLER
Only when Im working

GRADY hangs-over the railing and lets fly the Ziploc It
pinwheels through the vortex of stairs lands at Sams
feet

TRAXLER
Holy shit Are you serious

GRADY
As a heart attack

TRAXLER
Thanks-Whoa Professor Tripp careful “here

GRADY is still hanging over the railing-but looking dizzy
now His eyelids flutter and he tips forward-a Steinway on
a window ledge-and as he starts to drop

there is a SHARP JERK on his- COLLAR a SHIRT BUTTON
caroms off his cheek and slowly he is hauled back

SARA
Grady what are you doing you idiot

GRADY looks up into Saras freckled face

GRADY
Looking for you

He wants to say more he opens his mouth but then ALL
GOES BLACK AS SARAS VOICE CALLS

faintly at first then more forcefully calling Gradys
name calling so insistently that the earth seems to RUSH
upward until we see that she is

KISSING him or something and all goes softly Blue
INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

GRADY lies in a powder blue paper gown surrounded by blue
plastic curtains in a blue room Through a gap in the
curtains he can see the bottle of-GLUCOSE that drips
slowly into his arm and beyond a window Flakes of SNOW
fall outside

The DOOR SQUEALS a SHADOW ripples across the blue then
the curtains part and a RESIDENT with a clipboard appears
His NAMETAG says GREENHUT

GRADY
I passed out

GREENHUT
You did

GRADY

Ive been doing that a lot lately

GREENHUT
So I hear Youve also been smoking a lot of
marijuana I understand
GRADY
Do you think thats why Ive been having
these
(grabbing James term)
spells

GREENHUT
How long have you been having them

GRADY
The last month maybe

GREENHUT
How long have you been smoking marijuana

GRADY
Spiro T Agnew was vice president I believe

GREENHUT
Thats probably not the problem then What
about your lifestyle Any major changes
recently

GRADY
Ive been trying to finish a book

GREENHUT
And your wife left you

GRADY
Is that in my chart

GREENHUT
I spoke with the woman who saved your life
Youre lucky she came along when she did

GRADY considers the larger ramifications of this
statement

GRADY
I know

GREENHUT
(tapping the glucose bottle)
You need to see a doctor Mr Tripp An
internist And I think you really ought to
consider seeing a therapist as well

GRADY
She told you about

GREENHUT

Her dog yes

GRADY
Actually it was her husbands dog

Greenhut glances up looking GRADY in the eyes for the
first time and GRADY
stops

GREENHUT
Look Mr Tripp You have a drug problem all
right On top of that you have a bite on your
ankle that is severely infected We pumped you
with antibiotics so youll be fine but another
day or two and you might have lost the foot As
for your spells Im guessing theyre a result
of the anxiety youve been experiencing lately

GRADY
Theyre anxiety attacks Thats a little
disappointing

GREENHUT

Better luck next time

GRADY
So is my friendis Sara still here

GREENHUT
No Theres no one here

GRADY
I have to see her As soon as possible

Greenhut studies Grady calibrating the desperation in
his eyes then takes a quick glance at his watch

GREENHUT
Look Mr Tripp If you really want to leave
I cant stop you But Im going to write you a
prescription for a course of ampicillin and I
want you to follow it to the end-no matter how
stupid you decide to be with everything else
All right

INT HOSPITALBRIDGE WALKWAY - AFTERNOON
GRADY sits in a WHEELCHAIR watching the snow fail around
him as a NURSE escorts him through the tunnel of glass that

connects one building to another

GRADY

I wonder if you could show me something
EXT NURSERY - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

GRADY stares through the glass There are only TWO BABIES
on display heads dented from natural delivery skin purple
and crazy with veins

GRADY
Are these the only ones you have

The nurses eyes crinkle

GRADY (contd)
Kidding

EXT GASKELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

GRADY pays a TAXI CAB DRIVER then turns looks at
the Gaskell house

EXT FRONT DOOR - MOMENT LATER

GRADY KNOCKS Nothing Peers into the living room window
Dark He stands helplessly then spies the greenhouse
standing ghostly across the yard feathers of snow drifting
onto its roof melting

EXT GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER12S

GRADY hobbles to the greenhouse puts both hands to the
glass as he looks inside Quiet Empty Dispirited he
pulls away but not before leaving

the IMPRINTS of his hands perfectly etched in the
frost of the glass

EXT STREET 127

The snow continues to fall as GRADY lumbers down the
street Finally wearily he stops sits his crippled self
on the curb He plunges his fist into his jacket and
Straight through the lining James Leers silly little
pistol at the end of his hand He considers the pistol
then looks up into the sky

GRADYS POV - of the SKY

dark and menacing Suddenly a THUNDERCLAP shatters
the silence

NEW ANGLE - GRADY still sitting with the gun in his
hand

GRADY
(as if addressing God)
Is that a suggestion

GRADY sits blinking the snow out of his eyes then TWO
SHAFTS of-LIGHT dance across his shoes A white Citroen
DS23 appears It passes Slows Stops

GRADY stares at the car burbling at the curb then lifts
himself up and makes his way to the drivers window Sara
makes a face bugging her eyes a little-mad at him but-
not without humor Then she rolls down the window

GRADY
m so glad to see you Sara

SARA
believe you Did that nice doctor let you
out Or-is this you improvising again Grady

GRADY
m through improvising

SARA
erry told me about Wonder Boys Is it true
Did you lose it all

-

GRADY

lost it ail

SARA
Oh Grady Youre such a putz

GRADY
I know

SARA
And youre old

Sara strokes his scalp takes a gray hair between her
fingers Yanks

GRADY
Ouch How many

SARA
Dozens Its very sad

Sara smiles at Grady but the mischief leaves her eyes
when she looks into his and-she glances away
GRADY
I went and looked at-some babies just now

SARA
Oh

GRADY
(trying to make her laugh)
I guess you have to go on faith

SARA
(she doesnt)
Some times

GRADY studies her as she traces her finger around the
HOSPITAL BRACELET still encircling his wrist

GRADY
Did you tell Walter

SARA
I told Walter

GRADY

Does he still love you

SARA
It didnt come up

GRADY studies Saras freckled cheeks her anxious
profile then turns her chin gently toward him

GRADY
Well I do Ive always loved you Sara I
didnt know it at the time but Id always been
waiting for you My whole life Because youre
who I need Because nothing makes sense without
you Because the best moment of every day is
the moment I first see your face And because
when you leave a room theres no reason to be
in it any more Its just a room again

Sara cocks her head

SARA
Did you just make that up

GRADY
(shaking his head)
In the hospital I was kind of excited about
it at-the time but then I was on pretty heavy
painkillers
She frowns good-naturedly

GRADY (contd)
Even soits still true Every word

Sara just nods looks away her face unreadable

GRADY (contd)
Sara I promise even though commonsense might
tell you

Sara turns puts a finger on GRADYs lips

SARA
Dont write a page when a paragraph will do

GRADY nods takes her hand Looks at it as he speaks

GRADY
You dont deserve me you know

SARA
I know but sometimes

Sara turns looks at Grady Her eyes are glistening

SARA (contd)
You just go on faith

GRADY looks into her eyes then rises and we do too
drifting above the streetlights as GRADY limps to the other
side of the car and gets in As GRADY snaps shut his door
the car drifts off gradually losing itself in- the soft
veil of falling snow After a moment GRADY and Sara are
lost too nothing more than a blur

THE END
