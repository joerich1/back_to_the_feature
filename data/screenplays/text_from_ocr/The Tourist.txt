EXT PARIS - DAY

CRANE DOWN from a view of Paris on a misty day Cool
gray and beautiful

A taxi stops by the curb of a wide cobbled street All
around there is bustle and activity with cars and people
hurrying about their business

The door opens and a pair of exquisitely shaped female
legs in Christian Louboutin high heels swing out
INT GARE DE LEST PARIS - DAY

WE FOLLOW the legs up the steps across the concourse
through the station Men turn and stare

CARA MASON (30 stunning) shows no sign of noticing She
wears dark glasses and carries a traveling bag in one
hand a copy of the International Herald Tribune in the
other

INT BRASSERIE GARE DE LEST - DAY

A YOUNG WAITER wiping down the bar stops to watch Cara
enter and take a seat at a table slightly set apart
An OLDER WAITER approaches her They exchange a few
words and he walks toward the bar

WAITER
Shes waiting for someone

YOUNGER WAITER
Probably waiting for me

WAITER
The doors waiting for you if you
dont get back to work

A MESSENGER clad in leather wearing a motorcycle helmet
enters the cafe and looks around He consults a
photograph

His eyes land on Cara He walks over and holds out a
document-sized envelope

MESSENGER
Cest vous Mademoiselle

CARA
Oui

As the messenger walks away she opens the folder and
shakes out the contents There is a ticket for the
Orient Express and a handwritten letter

She spreads it out on the table like a precious treasure
map Her beautiful forehead creases with concentration as
she reads

ALEXANDERS VOICE (VO)
(English accent)
They are following you Cara

She looks up Takes out a small makeup mirror and holds
it in front of her face to glance around behind her

ALEXANDERS VOICE (V0O) (CONTD)
They think youll lead them to me
But if you follow my instructions
closely there is a way for us to
get away

Cara scans the rest of the letter
CAMERA glides down to see the signature at the bottom
Love Alexander

We barely have time to read this before Caras perfectly
manicured hand crumples the letter places it in a saucer
and sets fire to it

The YOUNG WAITER hurries over alarmed

YOUNGER WAITER
Mademoiselle Je vous en prie--

Cara is already gathering her things and walking away

INT GARE DE LEST STATION - MOMENTS LATER
As Cara walks toward the platform

ALEXANDERS VOICE (VO)
Take the 425 Orient Express to
Venice En route select a man my
approximate height and weight

Her eyes scan the platform

ALEXANDERS VOICE (VO) (CONTD)
Have faith Cara Ill be with you
soon

CARAS POV

Men of various shapes and sizes are boarding The Orient
Express She pauses only long enough to assess and
discard too old too young too thin too overweight

Her gaze comes to rest on a WELL-DRESSED FRENCH MAN
Medium height medium build Standing alone Examining

his ticket

Cara glances at her reflection critically in the polished
glass window of the train Adjusts her hair and dress

Satisfied with what she sees she turns and starts toward
the WELL-DRESSED FRENCH MAN like a cat stalking prey

The CAMERA admiringly FOLLOWS her silky approach

The FRENCH MAN hears the click of her heels and looks up
His mouth falls open
HIS WIFE arrives and shuts it for him

WIFE
What are you doing Vincent Our
train car is over here

With a regretful backward glance at Cara he allows
himself to be dragged away

Frustrated Cara turns and casts about for another
possibility

She spots a TOUSLE HAIRED MAN seated on a bench
CONDUCTER (VO)
All aboard All aboard the 425

is departing

Tousle Hair gathers his bags to get on the train
Encouraged Cara moves to cut him off

As Tousle Hair stands up REVEAL hes six foot seven
Cara stops short irritated The MAN behind her boarding

the train is fumbling with his suitcase and doesnt
notice BAM he walks straight into her

CARA
Ow
FRANK
Sorry Excuse me Pardone moi

FRANK TAYLOR (30s amiable) is a cheerful American
tourist Open face completely lacking in guile

Frank continues to mutter apologies as he walks gingerly
around Cara and boards the train

Cara watches him with thinly veiled contempt Frank is a
man of average size average build she peers over her
glasses at him And her expression slowly changes She
follows him onto the train

ANGLE ON
A GOOD-LOOKING ENGLISHMAN loitering further down the

platform reading the Herald Tribune Or rather not
reading it Hes been watching Cara He lowers the
paper and climbs onto the train through a different door

EXT PARIS - DAY

The gleaming Orient Express pulls out of the station and
gets underway

INT ORIENT EXPRESS - AFTERNOON
The train is moving

The thick carpet the mellow wood of the inlaid panels
the subtlety of the Lalique mirrors and the softly lit
lamps all inspire a feeling of great luxury

Frank looks vaguely out of place sitting by the window
in his casual jeans and pullover sweater Hes wrapped
up in a dog-eared paperback spy novel So wrapped up
that he barely notices Cara sit down opposite him

She crosses her legs He glances up

Slowly nonchalantly she takes her coat off Then the
headscarf tied around her neck

FOLLOW her sensual movements in TIGHT CLOSE UP The

effect is as if shes performing a tantalizing strip
tease

Frank is captivated to the point of being unsettled
She takes off her glasses to reveal stunning eyes

She goes to remove her mock-turtleneck sweater The
zipper seems to give her trouble

Without bothering to struggle she sits up in her seat and
leans toward Frank

CARA
I think Im going to need your
help

Frank is barely able to respond

FRANK
Hmm
CARA

My zipper
(off his blank look)
Its stuck
Frank finally moves into action He sets his book down

and leans closer

Awkwardly he reaches towards Caras beautiful neck He
attempts to unwind the trapped thread of fabric But the
zipper resists

FRANK
Im afraid of hurting you

She slides forward on her seat to get even closer

CARA
Dont be afraid

The train car sways slightly and throws Frank off
balance He tugs sharply and the zipper suddenly gives--—
with a tearing sound

Frank freezes looking down at the zipper still in his
fingers

FRANK
Im sorry

Caras eyes flash fury for a brief moment

CARA
It doesnt matter

FRANK
Maybe I should let you do this--

CARA
Dont give up so quickly

Reluctantly Frank continues with the zipper The
tearing sound continues as he lowers the zipper inch by
inch

First her neck then her throat then her cleavage are
gradually uncovered The zipper keeps going downward

No sign of anything underneath

Frank is practically sweating
Finally he uncovers fabric He finishes unzipping the
sweater and sits back into his seat

Cara slides it off her shoulders sensuous as ever

CARA (CONTD)
Thanks

And settles back into her seat cat-like He stares at
her for several moments at a loss for words

FRANK
My name is Frank

CARA
Cara

A white-jacketed STEWARD arrives

STEWARD
(to Frank)
Will you and your wife take dinner
here or in the dining car this
evening monsieur

FRANK
Pardon me Oh no Were not
actually--
CARA
The dining car would be lovely
thank you
The steward nods and disappears Frank just stares
CUT TO

EXT MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRYSIDE - SUNSET
The Orient Express plows through the Alps PUSH IN ON a

window where we see Frank and Cara sitting at a romantic
candlelit table eating dinner

INT DINING CAR - EVENING

Linen tablecloths Fine china Frank is one of the only
men in the dining car not in a dinner jacket
Frank takes out a bottle of pills from his pocket then
another and another

He takes one or two pills from each and swallows them
methodically She watches him

CARA
Are you ill

What No
She looks at all the pills spread out beside his plate
FRANK (CONTD)

Just nervous I dont like
travelling

CARA
(gently mocking)
So you decided to take a holiday
on the Orient Express

He hesitates

FRANK
Im on my honeymoon

CARA
Your honeymoon

Cara is annoyed at this revelation
CARA (CONTD)
Should we ask the waiter to set

another place

FRANK
Shes in Pennsylvania

Off her questioning look

FRANK (CONTD)
Youre sure you want to hear this

CARA
If youd like to tell me

FRANK
Two weeks ago she left me For
the owner of a pizza parlor

CARA
Thats awful

Frank nods matter-of-fact

FRANK
No travel insurance No refund on
the tickets So here I am On
my honeymoon

CARA

Im sorry Frank

FRANK
I really loved that pizza too
Bala Pizza if youre ever in

Rosemont

CARA
I wouldnt touch it Im loyal to
you

A waiter delivers their drinks

WAITER
A Cointreau for Mademoiselle And
for Monsieur a Miller Light

FRANK
Thanks

The waiter rolls his eyes and leaves them Cara seems
amused by Franks obliviousness

FRANK (CONTD)
What takes you to Venice

She nods toward his well-thumbed paperback

CARA
You read spy novels
(playful)
(MORE)

CARA (CONTD)
Im a mysterious woman on a train
You tell me what my story is

FRANK
Okay youd be a diplomatic

attaché or lets see a girl from
East Germany whose fathers been
kidnapped by Soviet agents

Theyre blackmailing you into
stealing probably a microchip
Theres usually a microchip

involved

CARA
What awaits me

FRANK
Trouble certainly

CARA
Danger

FRANK
No doubt Youll probably be shot
at in less than two chapters

CARA
Is there a man in my life

Beat

CARA (CONTD)
Or a candidate for the job

He gazes at her with a glimmer of hope Shes insanely
out of his league But shes the one flirting with him

FRANK
Maybe

CUT TO

EXT PARIS ILE DE LA CITE - EVENING

The magnificent Prefecture de Police on the Ile de la
Cité A convoy of black Mercedes arrives

INT INTERPOL OFFICES PARIS - EVENING

Footsteps echo in the grand marble hallways

JOHN ACKERMAN moves down the hall with purpose British
Interpol chief inspector Hes the kind of man who
commands respect (think Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive)

MELISSA JONES his American counterpart matches him step
for step

JONES
Were putting a lot resources into
this investigation John Tell me
youre going to get him this time

ACKERMAN
(dry)
Were going to get him this time
Ms Jones

GOYAL (Ackermans Deputy) closes his cell phone

GOYAL
Shes on the train Theyll be in
Venice in the morning

INT INTERPOL CENTRAL BRIEFING ROOM PARIS - EVENING

Behind the ornate 17th century doors is a high-tech
amphitheater style briefing room All glass and steel

Suited bureaucrats and officers from all over Europe
listen to Ackerman as he leads the meeting from the
podium

ACKERMAN
Our targets name is Alexander
Pearce British citizen born in
London into an ordinary middle
class family The only thing
remarkable about his childhood was
a preternatural gift for numbers

Ackerman clicks a slide projected on a large screen
behind him a fuzzy photo of a British schoolboy with a
shy grin

ACKERMAN (CONTD)
Which he used to hack into a
computer and fix the test results
his final year at school

JEAN LUC (French Interpol liaison) looks up skeptically

JEAN LUC
Your mastermind couldnt pass his
exams on his own

ACKERMAN
He didnt fix his test scores he
fixed the scores for all the girls
in the class It made him very
popular

A ripple of laughter through the group

ACKERMAN (CONTD)

(severely)
What started as school pranks
eventually became something much
more serious After a year in the
training program at Goldman Sachs
he decided that gambling suited
him better than working for a
living That in turn involved
him with some rather unsavory
people and ultimately led him to
put his financial genius to work
in his true calling money
laundering

QUINN is the Swiss Interpol liaison He speaks with the
crisp accent of a man who is fluent in several languages

QUINN
Youve assembled quite a task
force to catch a common money
launderer Mr Ackerman

ACKERMAN
There is nothing common about
Alexander Pearce Quiet simply
he has turned money laundering
into an art form His greatest
innovation The False Lawsuit

He clicks through a series of flashy Powerpoint slides
illustrating Pearces financial dealings

ACKERMAN (CONTD)
Pearce sets up two companies one
is a Casino in Arizona for example
and the other is a shell company
in the Cayman Islands

(MORE)

ACKERMAN (CONTD)

The Cayman Islands company files a
lawsuit against the casino
claiming copyright infringement or
some other complaint They
succeed in winning the case and
the casino pays the shell company
an enormous settlement

QUINN
(understanding)
The money travels from America to
the Cayman Islands

ACKERMAN
Yes but now the money is legal

JONES
Not quite legal The IRS has
been cheated out of the revenue
(beat)
We calculate that Mr Pearces tax
bill currently stands at 7437
million dollars

Jean Luc leans toward his colleague

JEAN LUC
(whispers in French)
That explains what the American
harridan is doing here

Ms Jones gives him a glacial stare

JONES
Exactement monsieur

Jean Luc reddens Oops Apparently not every American
fits the stereotype

ACKERMAN
Mr Pearce has some other debts as
well Most of you will recognize
Ivan Demidov

Click A PHOTO of a balding RUSSIAN OLIGARCH emerging
from a limo

ACKERMAN (CONTD)
Pearce laundered over a billion
dollars for Demidov At some
point Pearce decided hed rather
steal from Demidov than help him
steal
(MORE)

ACKERMAN (CONTD)
(beat)
Given Demidovs ties to organized
crime Id say that was a mistake

JONES
(clears her throat)
The US Government is not
participating in an investigation
of a member of the Russian
parliament our target is
Alexander Pearce

Ackerman smiles coolly at her

ACKERMAN
Of course

An INTERPOL OFFICER from Germany raises his hand
GERMAN INTERPOL
Has Mr Pearce ever been in

custody

Ackerman looks down for a moment as if it pains him to
answer

ACKERMAN
Almost

EXT ALEXANDERS SEA SIDE VILLA VENICE - NIGHT

SUPER ONE YEAR AGO

Fog covers the skyline exposing only the slate rooftops
of buildings that havent changed in centuries We hear
the sound of water gently lapping the shore

From out of the mist emerges

A GUARDACOSTE -- a patrol boat lights dimmed It gently
touches the beach A CARABINIERI officer lowers a ramp

An INTERPOL TACTICS TEAM in Kevlar and headgear pours out
of the patrol boat

Ackerman steps off pulling on a vest He nods to Goyal
ACKERMAN
Finally Lets go

They follow the team

EXT MAIN GATE OF THE VILLA - MOMENTS LATER

ANGLE ON A SPECIALIST who kneels to open an electric

panel REVEAL a glass plate with a fingertip shape in
the center The SPECIALIST places his hand against the
glass a red light beeps on -- its a bio-metric lock

He turns to Ackerman

SPECIALIST
This is gonna take a few minutes

Ackerman betrays no impatience He knows better than to
rush the professionals He simply nods

The Specialist opens a tool box filled with sophisticated
gear and gets to work

INT ALEXANDERS VILLA PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

Wrapping a towel around herself CARA MASON the girl
from the train stares at herself in the bathroom mirror
for a beat So do we

She steps out into the lofty master bedroom suite

In the dressing room Cara calls out to someone in the
next room

CARA
Ill be ready in fifteen minutes

Cara sits on the bed drying her hair On a night table
beside her are keys a wallet and an expensive MANS
WATCH
Cara pauses shes heard something

She walks across the tiled floor to the balcony
overlooking the elevator entrance

She freezes six tactics OFFICERS face her with guns
drawn

ACKERMAN steps up the stairs pistol in hand He
gestures at Cara to be quiet and come towards him

Cara stands stock still for a long instant Then

SLAMS the oaken door of the master bedroom suite in
Ackermans face locking it

She calls out
CARA (CONTD)

Alexander
ON THE STAIRS
Ackerman shakes the doorknob cursing a Tall Commander
calls for the BATTERING RAM which is rushed up the
stairs
The tactics team CRACKS the door
Ackerman charges into

THE BEDROOM

Cara stands frozen beside the mans effects on the night
table The wallet The keys The watch

ACKERMAN
Where is he

On the other side of the room Ackerman sees an OPEN
WINDOW which the ocean breeze swings

Rushing forward he sticks his head out the window
Hanging outside the window is the rigging for a WINDOW

WASHERS PLATFORM - a platform that seconds before was
lowered to the sand below

In the distance a recently boarded water taxi pulls away

from the dock and sails out into the lagoon

IN THE BEDROOM
Ackerman turns to face the study

On the desk is a cup of coffee with steam gently rising
from its surface A cigarette sits lit in an ashtray
the smoke curling toward the ceiling

Ackerman stares at the empty slowly revolving chair

He walks toward CARA now in custody He holds her
defiant gaze for a moment

ACKERMAN
You have nothing to say

Cara looks at him for a moment then lowers her eyes

ACKERMAN (CONTD)
Get her out of my sight

The Tall Commander shepherds the handcuffed Cara down the
stairs and into the elevator

She wears Alexanders WATCH

QUINN (V0O)
What does this Alexander Pearce
look like

cut To

INT INTERPOL CENTRAL BRIEFING ROOM - RESUME
Ackerman closes the file in front of him on the podium

ACKERMAN
Nobody knows He disappeared
after his escape Hes had
extensive plastic surgery to alter
his appearance since then Drug
lord Amado Carillo did the same
thing in the 90s to successfully
elude authorities

QUINN
How do you know about it

ACKERMAN
Pearce worked with no more than a
few accomplices at one time He
treated them so well that theyre
virtually all completely loyal
None of them would cooperate
Weve questioned the ones we could
find and the only thing we
learned is that Pearce apparently
arranged it so even his own people
have never seen him after the

surgery
JEAN LUC
So nobody knows what he looks
like
ACKERMAN
Correct
JEAN LUC

Forgive me for saying so Mr
Ackerman but he slipped away from
you when you knew his whereabouts
and his appearance What makes
you think you can catch him now

Ackerman regards him with aplomb

ACKERMAN
His girlfriend was recently
released from custody Hell come
for her Well be waiting

QUINN
What makes you so certain

Ackerman clicks on a slide

Caras face fills the screen behind him A murmur runs
through the room Every man stares

ACKERMAN
Hell come for her

Ackerman himself glances up at her face with a look of
longing

HOLD ON CARAS IMAGE for a moment before we

CARA stands alone on the platform amid the bustle of the
station The gleaming train stretches out behind her

INT TRAIN CAR - SAME

CARA
I didnt ask for an extra bed
Frank looks at her for a beat barely able to breathe

CARA (CONTD)

His face falls He tries to cover up his reaction
FRANK
No no no The sofas fine

INT INTERPOL FIELD HQ VENICE - DAY

CAMERA TRACKS WITH GOYAL as he weaves through a sprawling
mess of personnel and equipment cell phones computers
and cables from various national agencies The United
Nations-aspect of the Task Force gives it impressive
scope but also results in a Tower-of-Babel effect

The calm eye of the storm is Ackerman

GOYAL
Shes checked into the Danieli
shes not alone

ACKERMAN
Good
(to the room)
Maintain surveillance but keep
your distance

INT DEMIDOVS HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Demidov sips a glass of red wine The view from his room
rivals the one at the Danieli but Demidov pays no
attention Hes busy scanning his emails on his
Blackberry

Knock knock A thick-necked BODYGUARD in the background
goes to answer the door A moment later

He ushers in Quinn the Swiss Interpol agent

DEMIDOV
Take a seat Mr Quinn Can I
offer you a glass of Brunello
Its a 97

QUINN
No thank you Mr Demidov

Demidov swirls his glass

DEMIDOV
You know Id never admit this at
home but Vodka is for peasants
Theres much we could learn from
the Italians

He smiles pleasantly at Quinn then on a dime he turns
back to business

DEMIDOV (CONTD)
Tell me Im not going to be
disappointed

Quinn takes out an envelope and passes it over

QUINN
I dont think so

He flips it open and examines the contents WE GLIMPSE a
photo of CARA and some text

DEMIDOV
(to himself)
He always had good taste

Demidov makes a gesture and a second BODYGUARD with a
SCAR on his face gives Quinn an envelope filled with
cash

Quinn tucks it away discreetly as if embarrassed by the
directness of the pay off

QUINN
Mr Demidov if I may ask you a
question Why do you care so much
about Alexander Pearce I mean
youve come here yourself as if
it were personal

Demidov looks at Quinn thoughtfully

DEMIDOV
It may be difficult for you to
understand Mr Quinn you Swiss
are mercenary by nature But for
some of us there are things more
important than money I put my
trust in Alexander Pearce He
betrayed that trust

Quinn smiles tightly Hes ready to get out of there

DEMIDOV (CONTD)
And its bad business to let
somebody make a fool of you If
Pearce gets away with it what
does that say about me

EXT THE LIDO VENICE - DAY

A clear bright winter day at the beach Devoid of
tourists the famous stretch is a completely different
Venice from the one were used to seeing

Sandbanks stretch out into the dark green sea
Cara and Frank walk on a deserted patch of sand The

wind wraps her light sun dress around her body
intermittently hugging her perfect curves
CARA
So when youre not on a Grand
European Tour what do you do in
Rosemont Pennsylvania

FRANK
Im a teacher High school math
And you What do you do

She glances at him slyly over her movie star shades

CARA
This is what I do Frank

FRANK
Youre good at it

A sound of voices and laughter drift toward them Up
ahead on the beach they see a group of Italians in formal
clothes A woman wears a white bridal dress

CARA
Oh look a wedding How lovely

FRANK
Im not really into weddings at
this particular moment in my life

CARA
Oh yes I forgot

She takes his arm and steers him toward a bistro with
sidewalk tables

EXT BISTRO - AFTERNOON

Cara and Frank are seated A bottle of Orvieto rests on

the table

CARA
Do you think its really over

FRANK
Hmm

CARA
Maybe shell change her mind
Women do She might give you a
second chance

FRANK

I suppose thats a possibility
(hesitates)

Thats what I tell my statistics
class anyway life is a game of
chance Endless possibilities and
permutations You just have to
calculate the odds

CARA
You havent answered the question

FRANK
Well
(quietly)
Id like to think that love is a
question of destiny not chance

Cara looks at him curiously

CARA
For a moment there you just
reminded me of somebody

She shakes her head and takes a sip of wine

CARA (CONTD)
He had a way of dancing around a
question so eloquently that you
never noticed until later that
hed completely avoided the truth
His entire life was wrapped up in
deception
(lost in thought)
He told so many lies I wouldnt
believe him even if he finally did
tell the truth

FRANK
He doesnt sound like much of a
friend
CARA

He wasnt

Frank glances at her wrist
FRANK
So why are you wearing his watch

She looks up at him

CARA
Youre smarter than you look
Frank

She runs her fingertip over the face of the watch Then
impulsively unclasps it and reaches for Franks hand

CARA (CONTD)
And youre right Here take it

She puts it on Franks wrist over his protests

FRANK
What No I cant This thing
must be worth a fortune--

CARA

I insist Youre doing me a

favor

(firm)
Take it or Ill toss it in the
ocean
He hesitates She means it He closes the clasp

FRANK

Ill wear it until you regain your

senses

He feels the heft of it on his wrist Admires it for a
moment It really is a beautiful watch She settles
back in her chair pleased with herself

He looks up and sees her smiling at him

FRANK (CONTD)
What

CARA
It suits you

LONG SHOT of Frank and Cara framed by the sunset A
romantic dinner for two They could easily be lovers or
honeymooners

In the foreground REVEAL somebody watching them The
good-looking Englishman is there hovering

INT DOGES SUITE - NIGHT

The key sounds in the lock and the door swings open
Frank and Cara tumble in together laughing a little

tipsy

He glances at the sofa and that sobers him up reminding
him where hes going to sleep However

He watches Cara drop her wrap over a chair and kicks off
her shoes She throws open the French doors to the

balcony

Frank bypasses the sofa-bed and follows her outside

EXT BALCONY - NIGHT
Cara looks out across the lagoon
Frank appears beside her

FRANK
I could get used to this

A movement in the street down below catches her eye She
studies the Ponte del Vin intently seeing something

Cara turns abruptly to Frank and presses her body against
his Hes taken by surprise but willingly responds to

her advance wrapping his arms around her back

They exchange a long passionate kiss

VIDEO POV OF THE SAME

REVEAL the lens of a PALM-SIZED VIDEO CAMERA peering out
from behind a vendors cart in the street below

Frank his face slightly obscured kisses Cara

WE HEAR the WHIRRING of the video camera

IE DOGES SUITEBALCONY - RESUME
Still kissing Cara leads Frank back into the hotel room

EXT VIDEO POV FROM THE STREET - CONTINUOUS

The silhouettes of Cara and Frank disappear into the
hotel room as

INT DOGES SUITE - CONTINUOUS
Cara closes the curtains She pulls away from him

Her composure changes the passion is gone The
expression on her face is matter-of-fact

CARA
You should leave Venice tomorrow
(softer)
Its a city for lovers Frank no
place to recover from a failed
engagement

She turns and walks toward her bedroom
Frank stares after her in stunned disappointment

FRANK
What what did I do

She pauses at the door Her expression softens slightly

CARA
Nothing Im sorry

Then she disappears into her bedroom The door closes
behind her and we hear the click of the lock

Frank remains standing alone immobile

After several moments he sits on the sofa There are two
folded blankets and a pillow

From within Caras bedroom we can hear her voice muffled
but still audible

CARA (CONTD)
thats exactly what Im doing

but now I want him to go

He approaches the door straining to hear more but her
words fade out

cut To

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Frank gets ready for bed He takes off the watch Cara
gave him and something on the back of it catches his eye
Its engraved with a name

ALEXANDER PEARCE

He stares at the name for a moment then unzips his
travel bag Takes out his pills Pops a bunch Brushes
his teeth

He pauses and stares at himself in the mirror as if
wondering how in the world he ended up here Its like
hes staring into the face of stranger

He puts his tooth brush down and pads off to sleep on the
sofa

INT DOGES SUITE - MORNING

The sound of the SHOWER reaches Frank in his sleep He
blinks his eyes

The morning is misty He closes the balcony doors

Caras bedroom door is ajar Frank struggles not to
notice He turns to his bed and begins folding sheets

Then he hears the sound of water running in the shower

He glances over at the door ajar the sound of the
shower its too much

Frank walks to the bedroom door He pushes it open
The door to Caras bathroom is open The outline of her
naked body is visible in the shower She lifts her wet

hair and soaps the back of her neck

She sees him Cara is so stunned she simply stands
there

Frank walks to the shower and opens the glass door

Walking in he LIFTS Cara against the glass clutching at
her slithery body kissing her franticallyshe kisses
him back with ardor wrapping her dripping legs around
his back

CUT BACK TO
REALITY
INT DOGES SUITE - MORNING

Frank is sleeping A smile on his face A shadow passes
over him as somebody walks past

A mans trouser leg is visible in the foreground moving
slowly toward Frank Then

CLANG Frank wakes with a start to see
A WAITER is setting up breakfast on a cart

WAITER
Pardone Signore Good morning

Frank stares in surprise at the food spread out before
him

WAITER (CONTD)
La Signora ordered this for you
when she left
When she

He looks around the suite He is alone He nods

FRANK (CONTD)
Thank you

The waiter has finished He hovers for a moment

Finally Frank takes the hint and gives the man a one Euro
tip He takes it with disdain and leaves

Frank throws off his blanket and sits up

INT CARAS BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Frank strolls into the room barefoot in his boxers
The bed is unmade

Cara has left a shirt over a chair he picks it up and
holds it to his face for a moment to enjoy her lingering
scent

He notices a newspaper a copy of The International
Herald Tribune is open on her bedside table He lifts it
to see what Cara had been reading

There is a personal ad that has been lightly dotted with
a ball point pen The message is just a list of words
TOM CORRY NOW IN A MICA CAN IF FEELING PEST STILL
AROUND

The dots single out letters in a code Frank picks up the
pen and puts a faint line through the groups of
unselected letters to reveal the message

Tomorrow 11 Caffe Pesaro

Frank studies this for a moment

THE BUZZER SOUNDS
Laying the paper on the table Frank walks to the door

MANS VOICE (0S)

Breakfast
Frank reaches for the doorknob then pauses Breakfast
again
He quietly slides the chain on Peers through the
spyhole
SPYHOLE POV -- Two tough-looking men in suits stand
there most definitely not hotel staff One has a scar
on his face Demidovs BODYGUARDS

Frank is frozen
Scarface takes out a silenced PISTOL and mutters
something in Russian to his partner He produces a LOCK

PICK SET and crouches out of frame

Frank hears the sound of scratching metal and clicking
tumblers inside the lock He looks around wildly Sees
the KEY on the entryway table and reaches for it

Ch-chunk The Russian picks the lock and slowly starts

to open the door The chain stops it A pause

A moment later a KNIFE comes through the crack and starts
to slide the chain

Frank stares at the knife he has to act fast

Frank throws his shoulder against the door The knife
clatters to the floor as the door slams shut Frank jams
his KEY into the lock and turns the bolt into place

Theres angry confusion on the other side of the door

Frank grabs a heavy glass ashtray and swings it at the
back of the key-- breaking it off in the lock

Frank scrambles out of the way

The sound of metal scraping in the lock Russian CURSING
can be heard just outside A heavy blow as they try to
shoulder the door open

Frank looks around desperately for an escape

The bathroom The sitting room Adjoining doors None

Theres nowhere to go

Frank bolts for the balcony in his bare feet
He scrambles outside as

POP POP POP Bullets rip through the wood and metal
blasting the lock assembly apart The door bursts open

EXT BALCONY - DAY

Frank looks down and stares at the

DIZZYING SIX STORY DROP
to the cobblestones of the Ponte del Vin below

Guests sit on their balconies with their morning coffee
Three balconies over Frank sees the rooftop of the
modern wing of the hotel

IN THE SUITE
The two TOUGHS rapidly move through the room searching
Nyet Nyet

The one place they havent checked
THE BALCONY
Frank puts one bare foot on the stonework He grimaces
as he HEAVES himself onto the railing of the balcony

adjacent to his

He hangs desperately flailing 100 feet over the street
below He gets a tentative hold

A PALLID FRENCH WOMAN drops her coffee and screams

The Russians sprint out to the balcony They spot
Frank

Who shoves the Pallid Woman inside struggles past her
breakfast table and prepares to leap again-- but slips
on the spilled coffee

Bullets shatter China around him He cuts his foot on a
broken plate He grabs his bleeding foot

FRANK
Goddamn it Im a fucking
tourist
Another round of shots ring out They dont seem to

care
Frank goes over the railing with another awkward HEAVE

His pursuers scale the adjoining stone work and step onto
the Pallid Womans balcony

This time Frank lands in the lap of a BURLY WELSHMAN

BURLY WELSHMAN
Are ya bloody mad
The Burly Welshman PUNCHES Frank in the stomach which
drops him out of the way of

TWO SHOTS

Which explode into the Welshmans shoulder He cries out
and falls down on top of Frank

The Russians stand on the Pallid Womans balcony and
prepare to JUMP

as Frank crawls out from under the wounded Welshman and
peers over the next balcony

Which is at least TWENTY FEET from the roof
He misjudged the distance
FRANK
Shit

INT THE WELSHMANS ROOM - SECONDS LATER

Frank runs through the hotel room past the Welshmans
wife to the door

A SHOT behind him and pounding feet send him out into the
corridor past a room service steward to an

ELEVATOR

Which will not do but the--

INT SERVICE STAIRCASE - SECONDS LATER
STAIRS will and Frank flies down the steps three at a
time hearing his pursuers above him running harder than

hes run in his entire life

But hes slow and they gain on him enough to aim weapons
through the railing

P-CHING several bullets ricochet like pinballs in the
metal stairwell

Frank pants as he pushes out a side door
EXT RIO DEL VIN CANAL VENICE - DAY

Frank sprints along the edge of the canal dodging
tourists and children vendors and locals He spots a
VENDORS three wheel BICYCLE and jumps on

As he pedals he realizes its too slow so he JUMPS
OFF

and FALLS - a painful spill he cuts his hand - but
clambers to his feet as the Russians bear down Running
up hidden stairs he finds the roof of a shop on the Riva
Degli Schiavoni

EXT RIVA DEGLI SCHIAVONI VENICE - DAY

Frank runs down the ridge of the roof A silenced shot
hits roof tile nearby and throws him off balance He
FALLS

bumping down the other side of the roof until as he
topples over the edge he thrusts a hand at the gutter
smashing his head against the wall He drops onto the
pavement along the edge of the small canal

He doubles back towards the lagoon Looking back he sees
the men still in pursuit

He turns into the Campo San Zaccaria scattering the
flapping and fluttering PIGEONS The Gondolieri and
their passengers watch the half-naked man run past and
cheer

A GONDOLIER

(in Italian)
Run faster man

The Russians force their way past the pedestrians They
have almost caught him when
INT LEATHER SHOP - DAY

Ducking inside a leather shop Frank heads straight for
the back entrance and finds it

He stands on the cobblestones Blood streams from his
forehead as well as his hand He has

SECONDS
to decide which way to go The alley is long and narrow
on either side An awning above Clear sight lines

The back of the shop upends the Grand Canal

EXT ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER
The Russians burst out the back
There is no sign of Frank

Scarface looks at the Canal He walks to the edge of the
water and SPRAYS gun fire atop it Nothing

CUT TO

HIGH ANGLE OF SCENE
Frank lies huddled on his back IN THE AWNING behind the
leather shop barely able to control his frantic
breathing Hes mere feet away from the men who are

trying to kill him

He looks up and sees the scowling face of an Italian
WOMAN peering out over her window box

Frank raises a desperate finger to his lips A prayer
that she wont give him away

She looks at him disapprovingly Then disappears back
inside

CLOSE ON FRANK as he waits his heart pounding

Seconds tick past is he safe

Rrrrrip A black cylinder like the barrel of a gun
tears through the awning fabric inches from his Franks
head

He cries out The awning rips and dumps him down hard
onto the cobblestones below

A MOMENTARY BLACKOUT

Frank opens his eyes and sees two pairs of black boots
that belong to A PAIR OF CARBINIERI who stand over him
One of them holds a nightstick

They stare down at the bloodied tourist in his underpants
lying at their feet Theyve seen stranger things

INT POLIZIA QUESTURA (POLICE STATION) - DAY

Frank sits alone with a blanket over his shoulders Most
of the blood has been wiped from his wound and he has a
rough bandage on his head

From down the hallway a cheery stubble-faced POLICE
OFFICER DOMENICO (30s animated) walks into the room

where Frank is waiting

Domenico laughs talking on his cell phone as he enters

Domenico picks up Franks statement and glances at it

DOMENICO

Domenico looks him over

DOMENICO

He leaves Frank alone again

Frank stands and half-heartedly follows him to the
doorway

He spots something in the adjoining room a computer that
has been left on He wanders over and looks at the
screen

An idea comes into Franks head he looks around Nobody
is watching him He glances at the inscription on the
WATCH

Then quickly sits down He does a search for WANTED

In the restful silence he hears a DISTANT BANG A

gunshot A door slam Nervous he gets up and goes to
the door

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Frank looks right and left The corridor is empty and
silent lit by strip lights set on low

Just as hes about to close the door again Frank notices
that there is a label stuck there with his name on it
just above the room number

He struggles with the label for a few seconds tearing it
off

He sticks the label on the door to an empty room
opposite

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Frank goes to the sink and splashes water on his face
Stares at himself for several moments as he did in the
bathroom at the Danieli Hes lost in thought

Then

He hears the clang of a metal pushcart being wheeled
along Some footsteps approach There are voices speaking
an unfamiliar language maybe Russian

Russian

Frank scrambles for his clothes He fishes out

Domenicos phone number from a pocket and races to the
phone Then freezes listening

The footsteps move away slightly there is the sound of a
door opening The door across the hall

Seconds pass The door is closed again The footsteps

move down the hall slowly fading away

Frank punches in the policemans number and grips the
receiver It rings

INT DOMENICOS TERRACE FLAT - NIGHT
A saucepot simmers on the stove The phone RINGS
Behind it is a WINDOW - pierced by one circular bullet
hole

The music still plays

As our gaze drifts downwards we see Domenicos bare feet
prone behind the kitchen island

The phone RINGS and RINGS

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Frank is struggling into his clothes Everything seems to
stick and take forever

He opens the door a crack and looks down the ward
Nothing He moves along the passage slipping into
doorways and out of the light

He finds the elevator and jabs at the button

The light shows it is approaching the floor It stops
The doors open Frank is about to enter it when
suddenly SOMEBODY STEPS OUT

An ORDERLY exits and brushes past

Frank breaths a sigh of relief and steps in

INT HOSPITAL ELEVATOR PADUA - NIGHT

Frank presses the button for Receptione et Terre and
waits an interminable four seconds for the doors to
close

Slowly the elevator descends and stops

The doors open A big MAN stands with his back to us
blocking the exit Frank shrinks away with nowhere to
hide The man turns

Hes a MALE NURSE waiting to get into the lift He
stands aside to allow Frank to leave Frank takes a step
out

and sees SCARFACE talking to the receptionist
Hurriedly Frank reverses back into the elevator
FRANK
(to the Nurse)

Then just before the doors close Scarface turns his
eyes meet Franks He starts towards the elevator but
the doors shut first

The lift stops again The doors open on the first tier of
the subterranean car park

Frank leaps off

INT UNDERGROUND CAR PARK PADUA HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Limping and terrified Frank jogs towards the ramp marked
Uscita in the far corner

An ENGINE ROAR splits the silence The lights blind
Frank in the darkness as the car careers towards him

He falls to his knees
The car skids to a stop

The door flies open He squints Sitting behind the
wheel calm and beautiful as ever is CARA He stares

CARA

He climbs into the car She turns to him as she pulls
out

kill me--

CARA
(calm)
I know
Cara drives toward the ramp He looks at her
FRANK

Do you know why

CARA
Its because I kissed you

She stops the car and waits for the metal gate at the top
of the ramp to open It rises with a loud creaking to
REVEAL

A BLACK CAR with two men inside One of them steps out
and ducks under the gate as it rises up

While hes briefly silhouetted by the cars headlights we
glimpse the outline of an AUTOMATIC WEAPON

CARA (CONTD)
Shit

With remarkable sangfroid she cuts the engine and lets
her car roll backwards gliding silently and perfectly
into a parking spot

Silence

They watch the BLACK CAR slowly descend the ramp The
Russian with the gun in his hand walks carefully
alongside

Frank watches holding his breath

The sound of another engine cuts through the silence A
pair of headlights come up from the level below

CLOSE ON THE CAR The MALE NURSE from the elevator is
driving up toward the exit ramp toward the exit where
the Russians are waiting

CLOSE ON THE GUNMAN slipping back into the shadows and

readying his gun to fire

Hold on

Cara revs the car and pulls out fast cutting off the

Nurses car He leans on the horn

At the top of the exit ramp the metal parking gate is

slowly being lowered

She weaves around the black car deliberately heading for

the gunman He opens fire

BRRRRRAAAP Bullets spray wildly ricocheting off the
walls shattering windshields Frank covers his face as a

side-window pops showering him with glass

The GUNMAN is forced to jump out of the way as Cara

scrapes the side of her car along the wall

Sparks fly

The black car burns rubber as it U-turns to follow her

She guns it up the ramp towards the closing door

FRANK
Theres not enough room

CARA
Theres enough room

The fence whirs at head height and keeps lowering The
black car is closing in behind them

FRANK
We wont make it

CARA
I thought Americans were
optimists

At the last second he ducks instinctively and closes his
eyes The gate clips the top of Caras car with a
tremendous CLANG Traps it

Cara presses her foot all the way down on the
accelerator Smoke pours from the tires

CRASH

The black car RAMS them from behind

A Russian leans out the window and fires at the outlines
of Cara and Franks HEADS Bullets shatter the back

window

Cara pushes Franks head down The sound of burning
gears as the engine hits its limit

Suddenly scraping paint Caras car SPRINGS forward
jetting out onto the street

The fence drops further and shudders to a halt The
black car is trapped The Russians can only watch as

Cara speeds away

EXT PIAZZA SAN MARCO - EVENING

At last The Englishman arrives before the lower colonnade
of the DOGES PALACE the seat of medieval Venetian civic
government It is a wonder of Gothic architecture with
spires piercing the blue sky

taken in the hope of earning your
trust and ever-lasting regard I

EXT PONTE DEL SUSPIRI - SECONDS LATER
A silent caravan of three black SUVs - a strange sight
in Venice - pull up in perimeter around the Bridge of

Sighs and skids to a stop

Ackerman and the others leap out looking around Then
Ackerman sees it

The Englishmans CELL PHONE sitting on the cobblestones

They approach Goyal kneels to pick it up with a plastic
bag

Holding her now unimportant phone in her hand Cara draws
herself up and walks into the

SITTING AREA
Frank lies asleep on the couch

Cara walks to the kitchen and retrieves the Tuscan
Cookbook Thinking herself unobserved she opens it

A PAGE has been turned down A recipe for LAMB

Cara pulls out her red felt-tipped pen She finds a
sentence in the recipe with a single pen dot beside it

Tapping her pen under letters on the page Cara works out
the code memorizes the contents of the message and
closes the book
ON FRANK

His eyes are open

EXT VENICE - MORNING

Establishing shots of the city as it comes to life in the
winter time

Boats are pushed out into the canals
Trash is hosed from the cobblestone streets

Tables and chairs are set out at sidewalk cafes waiting
for the tourists to come

INT SITTING ROOM SAFE HOUSE - MORNING

With an unfamiliar gentleness Cara approaches Frank
sleeping on the sofa and touches his shoulder

CARA
Frank I have to go

He opens his eyes and looks at her

CARA (CONTD)
Dont go out All you need is
here In four or five days
everything will be resolved

FRANK
Resolved

CARA
It will all be over Ill give
you the all clear and you can go
back to your life This will be a
great adventure you can look back
on

FRANK
When will I see you again

CARA
Never

She looks at him evenly one last glance between two
people from two completely different worlds
CARA (CONTD)
Good-bye Frank

She leaves

INT RUN DOWN PALAZZO HALL - DAY

She has started down the stairs when Frank appears on the
landing He leans over the balustrade

FRANK
Is he worth it

CARA
Get back inside

She has stopped mid-flight

FRANK
Youre going to risk everything
for him Would he do the same for
you

She is quite straightforward in her response

CARA
It doesnt matter I love him

FRANK
He doesnt deserve it

She shakes her head

CARA
None of this is your business
anymore Now get back inside
Frank

Just as she raises her voice a door opens below them in
the hall and an old man comes out He looks up at Cara

OLD MAN
Signorina

This is exactly what she did not want But she controls
her annoyance nods in greeting and continues towards the
front door
CARA
(to the neighbor)
Mi dispiace Signor

The Old Neighbor nods as Cara walks out the door

He admires Caras shapely form as she crosses the
cobblestone streets and disappears into the alley

He glances back up at Frank and whistles appreciatively
Frank turns and goes back inside

INT INTERPOL FIELD HQ VENICE - DAY

Ackerman sits in an office chair gently revolving
Jones Goyal and Jean Luc are there as well

Why do women find these con men so
appealing

Jones is the only woman nearby

JONES
Dont look at me I married my
personal trainer
(sotto Jean Luc)
Shes twenty-six

Jean Luc cant tell if shes serious

ACKERMAN
How did Pearce seduce that
beautiful woman Was it his
charm His looks

GOYAL
Looks change

Ackerman sips from his ten thousandth cup of espresso

ACKERMAN
Maybe its because if he adores
himself and spends every moment
gratifying his desires so then
can she

He looks around to see if the others like this theory
ACKERMAN (CONTD)
She can become a child again Who
wouldnt want that

There is a bitterness in Ackermans tone that reveals he
is personally hurt by this

Goyals Blackberry makes a beep

GOYAL
Shes on the move Time to go

Ackerman pushes himself wearily to his feet
ACKERMAN

By all means Lets follow the
children

carefully pressed pants ironed shirt starched collar
etc

His two BODYGUARDS stand nervously at attention watching
him

DEMIDOV
When I was a young man times were
very hard When an opportunity
presented itself you took it
He pats talcum powder on himself The men remain stone-

faced

DEMIDOV (CONTD)
I was twelve years old when Gregor
asked me if I was ready fora
mans job He was the top
chelovek in our housing block So
I said yes He gave me a crowbar
and told me to go bash in the
skull of another boy who had
stolen something from him

He points at his platinum cufflinks on a bedside table
and snaps his fingers Scarface hands them to him

DEMIDOV (CONTD)
Now it just so happened this boy
was a friend of mine I did not
want to do this terrible thing
But when you come from the
streets you have no choice

He carefully knots his tie in the mirror

DEMIDOV (CONTD)
I worked very hard for years to
get past that life So I would
not have to do these terrible
things So I would have a choice

He turns and smiles at his THICK-NECKED bodyguard He
gestures toward the mans holstered pistol --

DEMIDOV (CONTD)
I have people like you to do these
things for me

He holds out his hand THICK NECK hands him the pistol

DEMIDOV (CONTD)
Except that you dont

Suddenly Demidov pistol whips the man across the face

Blood explodes from THICK NECKs nose He falls down to
one knee clutching his face in pain

Scarface looks on in fear Demidov calms himself almost
as quickly as he lost his temper He drops the gun on
the carpet and steps back in disgust

DEMIDOV (CONTD)
If you did your job properly I
wouldnt have to get my hands
dirty you piece of shit

He turns and walks into the bathroom to wash his hands

Frank pulls out a Gitane cigarette He lights it
smoking while he talks

Cara quietly picks up her bag and leaves the restaurant
She walks as fast as she can without being noticed toward

realizes shes gone

It shows the lower floor of the house
FRANK
(points)
Whos that

They all turn to look A male figure his face masked
approaches the lens of the surveillance camera

BLINK The FEED shuts off
Ackerman barks at a technician
ACKERMAN

What happened Get it back on
line

The surveillance techs begin madly punching buttons etc
JONES
Was that Pearce

GOYAL
How did he know there would be a
camera
BLINK Another monitor goes dark Then another
JONES

Hes taking out the entire
surveillance system--

ACKERMAN
Stop him

TECHNICIAN
I cant Hes cutting the feed at
the source

Frank looks anxiously at Cara on the monitor climbing the
stairs

Blink She disappears from view as well Everybody
starts talking

JEAN LUC
How can one man move through the
house that fast
GOYAL
(overlapping)
What should we do
ACKERMAN
Shut up Everyone
They quiet down Ackerman turns to the tech
ACKERMAN (CONTD)
Do we still have audio
The tech nods
ACKERMAN (CONTD)
Turn it up
Everybody in the Church stands stock still Staring at

the dark monitors Listening
Caras footsteps click up the stairs and then slow
They move tentatively across the floor
WE HEAR A THUMP A door or a heavy footstep

Caras breathing gets louder Theres somebody else in
the building

CARA (VO)
Alexander
No response Click clack click She takes a few steps
ON FRANK -- concerned
ON ACKERMAN -- calm

INT ALEXANDERS VILLA PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

Cara stands in the center of the large room She catches
sight of her reflection in the large floor-to-ceiling
window Theres a movement in the doorway behind her
She spins around to face

DEMIDOV He and his two men have removed their masks

DEMIDOV
Sorry to disappoint you my dear

He steps toward her

Cara pales

INT CHURCH - NIGHT
Everybody strains to hear what is happening
JONES
(whispers)

Who is that

DEMIDOV (VO)
How are you this evening

CARA (VO)
(a tremor in her
voice)
Fine thank you

JEAN LUC
The accent is Russ--

ACKERMAN
Shh
(quietly)
Its Ivan Demidov

Jones looks at him
JONES
(uncertainly)

Not possible

INTERCUT WITH THE VILLA

Cara takes a step back toward the window

follows

DEMIDOV

Youre waiting for someone Ms

Mason
Cara doesnt reply

DEMIDOV (CONTD)

You havent seen Alexander Pearce
in a long time yes Im sure it

will be a touching reunion
(MORE)

DEMIDOV (CONTD)

If you dont mind well keep you

company while you wait

GOYAL
(anxious)
What are we going to do

ACKERMAN

Were going to wait for Alexander

Pearce Just like them

EXT ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Demidov

SNIPERS POV - CARA has maneuvered close enough to the
window that she is visible As they approach Demidov
and his two men come into range as well

SNIPER
(into his radio mic)
Shes brought them to the window

INT CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
Everybody is listening

SNIPER (V0)
there are three of them

ON FRANKS FACE - he looks around at the cops desperately
hoping somebody will do something They all look to
Ackerman

INT ALEXANDERS VILLA PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
Demidov circles Cara dangerously close

DEMIDOV
Not very polite of your boyfriend
to keep you waiting

CARA
He loses track of time easily

DEMIDOV
I have a hard time believing that
(pause)
Perhaps hes already here
somewhere hiding even watching
us

INSIDE THE CHURCH

DEMIDOV (VO) (CONTD)
What do you think

A long silence The tension grows Then we hear
A LOUD SLAP
Everyone in the room flinches

DEMIDOV (VO) (CONTD)

You know I have a feeling he is
around here somewhere And if he
cares about you if he wants to
see your lovely face again he
should show up before its too
late

ANOTHER SLAP - MORE VICIOUS THAN THE FIRST This time
Cara cries out in pain

Goyal turns to Ackerman

GOYAL
Sir
ACKERMAN
Demidovs right Hes here
somewhere
Another SLAP Another scream
Jean Luc looks to his colleagues-- Jones Quinn then

turns to Ackerman Every one of them is about to burst

JEAN LUC
We have to do something--

ACKERMAN
We have to wait

JEAN LUC
Yes but--
ACKERMAN
(harsh)
Shes my agent Shes my
responsibility

A muffled THUD Cara groans and WE HEAR her body hit the
floor That wasnt a slap

Every cop in the room is clenching his weapon Desperate
for the order to move To jump in and stop this

They are all looking to Ackerman to give the order

As the silence wears on even Jones starts to waver She
speaks quietly to Ackerman

JONES
What if he doesnt come
Ackerman doesnt respond

The lack of sound in the church is even more disturbing
than before

Suddenly Goyal notices

GOYAL
Wheres Taylor

SMASH CUT TO

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Frank runs for all hes worth Panting for breath

INT ALEXANDERS VILLA - NIGHT

Frank bursts through the front door Races to the steps
without hesitating

INT ALEXANDERS VILLA PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

Cara lies on her side at Demidovs feet Blood trickles
from the side of her mouth

Her eyes are clouded with fear and pain as she views the
room half-askew Then they suddenly come into focus as
she sees
A figure walks into the room FRANK
He stand motionless in the doorway surprisingly calm
Demidov turns
DEMIDOV
(leans down to Cara)

Good news He loves you

Demidovs men take Frank by either arm and roughly drag
him forward

Cara lifts her head with an effort
CARA
Thats not Alexander Pearce

Demidov ignores her and walks up to Fran

DEMIDOV
You know Mr Pearce I though
was finished with this sort of
thing But in your case Ive
been forced to make an excepti

He holds out his hand and one of his THU
PISTOL and a SILENCER

CARA
He is NOT Alexander Pearce

Demidov begins screwing the silencer ont
The thugs push Frank to his knees

But hes barely paying attention to them
locked on Cara

She meets his gaze For a moment its a
else in the world exists but the two of

He may only be a hapless tourist but he
Hes the one here willing to give up hi
hers

CARA (CONTD)
Oh Frank Im so sorry

FRANK
Nothing to be sorry for

Demidov finishes attaching the silencer
gun at the back of Franks head

DEMIDOV
Good bye Mr Pearce

At this moment Cara fills her lungs and

CARA

She bends her head toward her cleavage

His eyes are

He points the

yelling into the

Ackerman

Demidov is taken off guard

INT CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
Her scream echoes through the arched church

Ackerman gives the order

ACKERMAN
Do it

EXT ROOFTOP - NIGHT

SNIPERS POV - Demidov and his gun-wielding henchmen
standing over Frank and Cara

INT ALEXANDERS VILLA PENTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The huge plate glass window shatters as the high powered
bullet slams through it

Everything explodes in a mass of blood and glass
SCARFACE is blown off his feet His body hits the ground
next to Frank his gun skitters across the floor

Demidov looks from the window to Cara with cold fury in
his eyes-- shes the one who has called in the artillery
He raises his pistol toward her point blank

BANG The gunshot takes him by surprise He turns to
see

FRANK holds Scarfaces smoking pistol in his hand
Demidov just has time to process the fact that Frank is
the one who shot him before the life drains from his eyes
and he topples

Demidovs other bodyguard fires out the windows wildly
and makes a run for it Glass flies everywhere

Frank throws his body over Cara to protect her

A short and furious exchange of gunfire as the other
plate glass windows explode Wood splinters fill the air
as furniture is torn apart Finally

One of the snipers bullets finds its target and the
BODYGUARD goes down

Frank remains on top of Cara shielding her until long
after everything has fallen silent

EXT ALEXANDERS VILLA - NIGHT

Ackerman and his team approach guns drawn

Undercover agents converge as well closing the
perimeter

INT ALEXANDERS VILLA PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

Frank and Cara sit in the middle of the room amongst a
sea of broken glass Just getting over the shock of
being alive

FRANK
Are you all right

Cara nods She looks at him for a long moment then
breaks out into a smile

CARA
I did well to choose you on the
train
Franks turn to smile He looks around the room at the
carnage
FRANK
You didnt get to arrest Alexander
Pearce
CARA

He never showed up

Frank slides closer to her Gently carefully he slips
his hands into Caras cleavage

Surprised Cara starts to pull back-- but he puts a
finger to her lips

She hesitates looks at him questioningly But she
doesnt protest as his fingers move toward her bra

and grasp the tiny MICROPHONE With a sharp tug he
rips it free He tosses it across the room

Then he leans a little closer and whispers in her ear
FRANK
(a British accent)
Youre wrong Im here

She straightens up Her heart skips a beat

FRANK (CONTD)
Its me Im here

She covers her mouth Her eyes mist over with tears

She runs her fingers over his face with loving amazement
Like a blind person trying to recognize a familiar face

Her mind reels

Then their lips meet They kiss And kiss Like
drinking from a fresh spring in the desert

Finally she pulls away and looks at him

CARA
Why

FRANK
You said Id told so many lies
you wouldnt believe me even if I

did tell the truth This was the
only way to convince you
(pause)

The truth is that I love you All
that matters is that you believe
me

She stares into his eyes for a beat Finally looking at
her without a trace of deception She believes

They hear voices on the stairs below
Frank holds up a finger to her-- wait

Frank crawls across the room and presses a hidden latch
on a built-in bookshelf It swings out of the way to

reveal a hidden safe built into the floor

Frank removes the fitted floor boards There is a
sophisticated BIO-METRIC LOCK -- just like the one at the

gate in the beginning of the movie

Frank places his finger on the spot and the lock clicks
open

cut To

INT ALEXANDERS VILLA - NIGHT

TRACK WITH ACKERMAN up the stairs

He leads the team into the PENTHOUSE

He looks around at the mess as the agents fan out
Cara leans on Franks arm as she heads for the exit

ACKERMAN
Cara I want the paramedics to
make sure youre all right--

She blows right past him Ackerman calls out after her

ACKERMAN (CONTD)
Cara

She pauses Turns to face him
Ackerman looks down for a moment ashamed

ACKERMAN (CONTD)
Im sorry I well talk about
this later

CARA
No we wont Theres nothing to
talk about I dont work for you
anymore

She walks past him For a moment Ackerman and Frank look
at one another

ACKERMAN
Mr Taylor youre free to go
He looks at Frank with a measure of begrudging respect

ACKERMAN (CONTD)
It seems I underestimated you

FRANK
(American accent)
It seems you did Mr Ackerman

With that Frank steps out of the room Ackermans
attention is distracted by--
GOYAL
Sir over here Take a look at
this
Goyal has found the safe Ackerman comes over and looks

INSERT CLOSE UP - the only thing in the safe is a single
FLASH DRIVE

Goyal signals to one of the TECHS He opens a laptop on
the desk and they plug in the FLASH DRIVE to check the
contents

While they are doing this Ackerman bends to inspect the
BIO-METRIC LOCK

ACKERMAN
He was here

Jones looks on eagerly as numbers fill the screen

GOYAL
Account numbers access codes
unless Im mistaken he left the
money behind

JEAN LUC
A mistake perhaps

JONES
How much is there

Goyal scans down to a total

GOYAL
Looks like 744 million

JONES
Thats no mistake
(walks over)
Thats his tax bill

She holds out her hand to the TECH who has just removed
the FLASH DRIVE

JONES (CONTD)
Ill take that

She slips it into her pocket then turns to Ackerman

Ackerman has moved away Hes staring down at the ground
-- from behind he looks like a man defeated

JONES (CONTD)
Well John with the funds
recovered I dont think theres
going to be any appetite from our
side to continue this
investigation

Ackermans shoulders are slumped staring at Demidovs
dead body on the ground Jones puts a hand on his back
consoling him

JONES (CONTD)
Im sorry you didnt get your man

Then Ackerman turns a big smile on his face
ACKERMAN
Oh but I did get my man Ms
Jones

She realizes he was after Demidov all along
Ackerman nods to Goyal a twinkle in his eye

ACKERMAN (CONTD)
Mr Goyal you may place Mr Quinn
under arrest now

Quinn is taken completely off guard Before he can move
Goyal and another agent have placed him in handcuffs

ACKERMAN (CONTD)
(to Quinn)
What You thought I didnt know
You were unwittingly quite
helpful without you Mr Demidov
might have escaped justice

He turns to Jones with a smile
ACKERMAN (CONTD)
After all Demidov wasnt a target
of this investigation was he

Ackerman walks over to the window as Quinn is led away

ACKERMANS POV - Cara and Frank walk toward the canal in
the street below

A WATER TAXI approaches

JONES
Theres something I dont
understand how did Pearce manage

to get here and open that safe
without anybody noticing And
where did he go

Ackerman stands at the window with his hands behind his
back For the briefest of moments Frank looks back up
at him and their eyes connect

Frank gives him a little smile Cara takes his arm to
climb onto the boat

CLOSE ON ACKERMAN his eyes narrow He knows

For a moment he doesnt move Then in spite of himself
a small smile creeps over his face too

ACKERMAN
Because Pearce was cleverer than
all of us

CUT TO
EXT WATER TAXI - NIGHT
Cara and Frank step on board
The DRIVER starts the engine
He turns to REVEAL that he is the ENGLISHMAN weve

seen throughout the movie He and Frank look at one
another for a moment

THE ENGLISHMAN
20 million dollars worth of
surgery and thats the face you
chose

FRANK
(English accent)
Its good to see you too

They embrace warmly Cara is in disbelief realizing
just how completely FrankAlexander has planned things
out

She casts one last glance backwards

CARA
You really think theyll just give
up

FRANK
The Americans have their money I
left it all for them

CARA
What about Demidovs money

FRANK
Well
(smiles)
You have to save something for
your pension

The Englishman opens the door to the cabin for them

A bottle of Crystal Champagne and two glasses are set out
for them Frank leads Cara in and offers her a glass

Instead she slips into his arms and presses against him
They begin to kiss

CAMERA STAYS discreetly behind as they pull away from us
the water taxi swinging out into the Grand Canal

As it recedes from view the vaporettos tail lamps
shimmer and blend into the beautiful lights of Venice
city for lovers

THE END
