EXT CHATEAU LA STROQUE - LATE AFTERNOON 1

A rustic Provencal farmhouse surrounded by rows of well-kept

vines Up above the sky is a sparkling jewelbox of stars a
Down below all is quiet except for the chirrup of the

cigales

EXT FARMHOUSE GARDEN - SAME 2

A gorgeous trellis of jasmine and honeysuckle is lit by a
pair of flickering candles Beneath it MAX SKINNER age 12
sits alone puffing a Cigar while staring at a chess board
pondering his next move An old radio broadcasts in
French

Josephine Baker’s “Breezin’ Along With the Breeze” comes
onas Max’s eyes drift across the garden--

MAXS POV - ENTRANCE TO THE WINE CELLAR

A shaft of light spills out from the cellar Downstairs we
can HEAR wine bottles being moved and RATTLED

BACK TO SCENE

Max taps his ash His eyes anxiously dart between the
chessboard and the cellar entrance Finally with ‘the ease
of an experienced con artist Max slides his bishop one
square forwardjust as he hears footsteps climbing the
stairs Max quickly crosses his arms resuming his pose of
deep contemplation

THE WINE CELLAR

Emerging from the cellar is Max’s UNCLE HENRY early-50’s
Uncle Henry is a sermonizing eccentric with warm knowing
eyes and the countenance of a man who hasn’t worked very
hard for a very long time He wears a pair of pajamas -
shirt-top opened revealing a round Buddha belly He puffs
on a Cigar as he crosses the lawn swinging a bottle of
red
09192005 1A

UNCLE HENRY
Max my boy -- seeing that it’s your
last night here I thought it only
appropriate that we open something
extra special
09192005 2

He presents the wine with the flourish of a waiter

UNCLE HENRY

Tempier Bandol 1969 ‘The kind of

wine that‘ll pickle even the
toughest of men I once saw a
Castilian prizefighter collapse
into a heap after drinking just a
single glass of course my knee
landing squarely on his testicles
may have been partly to blame

He begins opening the bottle

UNCLE HENRY
What was I talking about before

MAX
Blue suits

UNCLE HENRY
Blue suits

MAX
You said the importance of a good
blue suit can never be overstated

UNCLE HENRY

Quite right A blue suit is the
most versatile of accoutrements
But even more important than the
suit itself is the tailor who fits
it for you Take note Max once
you find a good tailor youre not
to give his name away -- not even
under the threat of bodily harm

Uncle Henry pours a glass for himself One for Max Then

spills a little water into Max‘s glass just to soften it a

bit He takes a seat

UNCLE HENRY
Now where were we Whose turn is
it

MAX
Mine

Uncle Henry suspiciously studies the board
suspects that Max has moved his bishop

He quickly

09192005 2a

UNCLE HENRY
Max have I told you why I enjoy
making wine so much

09192005 3

MAX
You don’t make the wine Uncle
Henry that guy Duflot does

Max points out to the vineyardwhere -- far off -- a lone
FIGURE rides a tractor across the land

UNCLE HENRY
You’re starting to sound like a
communist Max In France its
always the landowner that makes the
wine even if all he does is
supervise with binoculars from the
comfort of his study

(swirls his wine)

Now then -- I enjoy making wine
because this sublime nectar is
quite simply incapable of lying
You see Max all the work we do

here at La Siroque -- all the
Planting all the harvesting all
the fermenting -- it’s nothing more

than the art of bottling truth
Par example if perchance one year
it rains too much the wine will
tell you that very easily by the
depth of it’s color

(holds the wine up to a

candle)
And if it rains too little it‘li
tell you that tooin it’s aroma
and bouquet

(sniffs the wine)
Pick too early pick too late it
matters not -- the wine will always
whisper into your mouth with
complete unabashed honesty every
time you take a sip

(takes a sip)
Abhh Delight£ul

(then serious)
So Max-a-millionnow that you
know why I love wine so much do
you have something you want to tell
me

Max looks at his Uncle poker-faced Then down at the chess

board

MAX
Yes I do

09192005 3a

UNCLE HENRY
Wellwhat is it

Max gulps his wine Then moves his bishop--

NATHALIE
In the arrangement the vigneron
makes the wine the estate owner
maintains the property C’est

are then shared equally This is
how your uncle and Monsieur Duflot
worked for over thirty years
Naturally Monsieur Duflot will be
anxious as to your intentions

INT MAITRE AUZET’S OFFICE - A BIT LATER 77

Max paces the office apoplectic aAuzet sits behind her
desk studying the photo of Henry and Christies Mom

But she never even met my Uncle

AUZET
Under French Law there is no
difference between legitimate and
illegitimate children when it comes
to their right to inherit In
theory the girl would be entitled
to sole ownership of the estate

MAX
Ridiculous She could be an
imposter

AUZET

That is precisely why she would be
required to produce some form of
documentation -- a photo or even
correspondence If this is deemed
sufficient evidence a DNA test
would then be ordered to establish
paternity

be eh

MAX
Dig the old boy up Bollocks you
will

AUZET
Mr Skinner your Uncle Henri was
cremated

MAX
(off the hook relieved)
Thats right Great

AUZET
Howeverviable samples can be
obtained from an old hairbrush or
even a licked stamp

MAX
(scheming)
Suppose I was to sell the
placebefore she filed a claim

AUZET

Legally she could invalidate a
sale even after the transfer of
title

(Max at wits end)
But this is all assuming the girl
wishes to make a claim Perhaps
her intentions are harmless My
advice is to treat her with the
utmost respect and hope she’1ll be

on her way French courts have a

way of favoring the lesser dog
don’t make her one

UNCLE HENRY

Are you speaking in tongues boy

YOUNG MAX
(confident)
Fervere It’s a Latin term It
means “to boil” The native yeasts

in your cellar are converting the
sugar inside the grapes to alcohol
The release of carbon dioxide gas
is what causes the bubbling effect

UNCLE HENRY
I must be suffering from dementia
I don’t recall ever having taught
you that

EXT VINEYARD - MORNING 100

Christie sips coffee and wanders the vineyard She reaches a
wall of brush that marks the end of the Property-line Then
notices a small arch-like openingand walks through it
finding herself beneath a canopy of dense trees She advances
toward a burst of light that floods through the outlet on the
other side of the grove

Christie finally emerges into the blinding whiteness When
her eyes adjust she sees she’s standing on yet another
hectare of vines Oddly these vines aren’t growing in dark
soil but are planted in gleaming white limestone rocks
It’s otherworldly She kneels and scoops up a wilted bunch
of embryonic grapes from the soil Inspects themas she
strolls up to--

A SMALL SHED

some grass which he feeds on lazily

she motions into the limestone hectare but Duflot gently
tugs her back---

home is a Provencal hacienda made of pinkish concrete In
front is a meticulously landscaped flower garden and enough
decorative ironwork to open a showroom

Duflot awaits on his porch dressed in black trousers a
black shirt and a big amile Frances answer to Johnny
Cash As Max crosses the front garden -- BLING -- a gaggle

thrush pate with the bird’s beak protruding from the dark
meat

and the fight devolves into a wrestling match

Vin de garage

CHRISTIE

It’s a garage wine Like a

small production seriously big

Tell ug Madame Duflot what is it
that makes youso-sure she is
Henry’s child

MADAME DUFLOT
(gesturing)
But of course the nose

MAX
Besides that

An awkward silence as Madame Duflot can’t answer
is irritated at being discussed like this

MAX
Come on there-tmust be something
anything -- besides that lovely
snout -- that can help corroborate
her claim

(to all)

IT mean did Henry ever discuss
California Or a woman in
California Any drunken moments of
candor where he mentioned
offspring I mean seriously the
last person Henry would breed with
is an American

Duflot shrugs interrupting

DUFLOT
(serious observation)
Sadly in this moment I see more
of Henry in the girl than I do in
you

Christie

All eyes turn to Christie who somehow barely maintains her
dignity Max now openly jealous She stands as if about to
make an important announcement and holds onto the table for

148 EXT LIMESTONE HECTARE - DAY 148

Max wanders past Syrahto a lonely place in the VINEYARD
where he stops

148A WE ARE NOW IN A FLASHBACK YOUNG DUFLOT (20S) is on 148A
bended knee weeding the soil Young Max spies on him from
behind the vinesand can hear him sing the lilting aria
“Flower Song” from Carmen

DUFLOT
La fleur que tu mavais jetée
Dans ma prison métait restée

Uncle Henry appearsand kneels beside to Max

YOUNG MAX
Whys he singing to them Uncle
Henry

UNCLE HENRY

Max the terroir needs more than
sun and rainmore even than the
loving hand of a winemaker It
needs harmony It needs balance

Henry stands up and Young Max follows They start to walk
Side-by-siderow by row

HENRY
You see Max balance in wine is as
elusive as balance in life In

life it requires a heart that can
listen Notice Max the first
four letters of heart are h-e-a-

rv Take note since a balanced
wine can only be produced by a
balanced vine -- it stands to

reason that a balanced life can
only be produced by a balanced man
It is therefore your charge boy
to find that which brings harmony
to your terroir take hold of it
and nevereverlet it go

WE ARE BACK THE PRESENT ‘ 149
09192005 94a

Max is now upon Duflot who is on his hands and knees
weeding the soil
09192005 95

DUFLOT
My whole life people laughed at me
for singing to my vines TI

explained that someday the vines
would sing back
(beat)
Here they finally have
(standing razor sharp
eyes)
You don’t know what you are doing

MAX
What are you talking about
DUFLOT

(passionately)
Ioi Le Coin Perdu

Duflot takes a bunch of grapes from the vines and crushes
them in his fists juice spilling all over him

‘MAX
Thats impossible The oenologue
said--

DUFLOT

The cenologue was paid to say that

Max paralyzed

DUFLOT
We thought that if you believed La
Siroque had no value you would
leave things as they were Status

quo

Max aghast

MAX
Why didn’t you tell me about this
Why didn’t you trust me

DUFLOT

Max would you trust you

(ouch that hurt)
Your Uncle always intended to leave
the estate to youbut he worried
about what you had become “My
nephew is selfish” he used to
say” “How can I give La Siroque
to a man who can’t even appreciate
the simple pleasures of life” So
it was never written Alas fate
snatched him before he could decide
what to do

i ee es

MAX
(more or less devastated)
»and I’ve sold it

DUFLOT
(philosophic)

Then you have done the very thing
your Uncle feared you would do
You have sold his spirit to the
highest bidder Max And betrayed
the only man who ever cared for
you
