FADE IN

On the blackness of SPACE beautiful and mysterious strewn

with a billion stars Atop a building

a wrought-iron sign --

a HAMMER-WIELDING BLACKSMITH -- spins listlessly in the wind
as a swirling breeze kicks up A hint of whats to come

EXT PUENTE ANTIGUO NEW MEXICO - NIGHT 1

A main street extends before us in this one-horse town set

amid endless flat

down the street and heads out of town

EXT SUV - NIGHT 2

The SUV sits parked in the desert Suddenly
of the SUV FOLD OPEN The underside of the panels house a
variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES which now point
at the sky JANE FOSTER (late 20s) pops her head through
She positions a MAGNETOMETER so its monitor
calibrates with the constellations above It
cobbled together from spare parts of other devices

the roof

JANE
Hurry

arid scrubland A large SUV slowly moves

the roof panels

appears to be

We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below
Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG who emerges as
well rubbing his head

JANE (CONTD)
Oh-- watch your head

SELVIG
Thanks So whats this anomaly70
of yours supposed to look like

JANE
Its a little different each time
Once it looked like I dont know
melted stars pooling in a corner
of the sky But last week it was a
rolling rainbow ribbon--

SELVIG
(GENTLY TEASING)
Racing Around Orion7i Ive
always said you should have been a
poet Jane reigns in her
excitement She tries for dignity

JANE
Hey Darcy Pass up the bubbly and
my gloves will you

(MORE )
JANE (CONTD)
Intern DARCY LEWIS hands Jane
a bottle of Champagne and a pair of
gloves through the window Jane
passes it to Selvig to hold while
she pulls on the old gloves -- too
large and masculine for her small
hands He starts to unwrap the
foil and she stops his hand with
an excited grin

JANE (CONTD)
Not until you see it

SELVIG
(re the gloves)
I recognize those Think how proud
hed be to see you now Janes grin
fades to a sad smile

JANE
Thank you

SELVIG
For what

JANE
The benefit of the doubt The two
stare out at the sky expectantly A
long beat while they scan the
skies Nothing Janes worried

JANE (CONTD)
Its never taken this long before
Darcy calls up from the front seat

DARCY (0S)
Can I turn on the radio

JANE
(an edge to her voice)
Sure if you like rocking out to
KFRM All agriculture all the
time70

Worried Jane heads back down into the vehicle
INT SUV - NIGHT 3 3

The SUV is bathed in the glow of high-tech monitoring
equipment and laptops some looking like theyre held
together with duct tape Jane opens a well-worn NOTEBOOK of
handwritten notes and calculations Selvig watches the
frustrated Jane with sympathy
JANE
The anomalies are always
precipitated by geomagnetic storms
She shows him a complicated CHART
shes drawn in the book tracking
occurrences and patterns

JANE (CONTD)
The last seventeen occurrences have
been predictable to the minute I
just dont understand Something
catches Darcys eye out the
drivers side mirror She adjusts
it In the distance ODD GLOWING
CLOUDS form in the skies over the
Northeastern end of the desert

DARCY
Jane

Jane SHUSHES her leafs through her notes The bottle of
champagne begins to vibrate

JANE
Theres got to be some new
variable Or an equipment
malfunction

The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around
them The computer monitors SQUELCH with static

DARCY
I dont think theres anything
wrong with your equipment The

champagne bottle starts to RATTLE
noisily now as it shakes more
violently Jane and Selvig notice

They watch it curiously pressure building up inside it
when the cork EXPLODES out of it Champagne goes spewing
everywhere -- over equipment over Jane

DARCY (CONTD)
Jane

JANE
What

DARCY
I think you want to see this Darcy
points out the window Jane and
Selvig look out Over the desert --
MASSIVE CLOUDS OF RAINBOW LIGHT
Churn in the sky The three stare dumbfounded

JANE
Holy Shatner

SELVIG
Thats your subtle7¥ aurora

JANE
No-- yes Lets go

EXT DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 4 4

The roof panels still open the SUV races towards the
strange event Jane amazed by the sight stands with half
her body out the roof taking video of the light storm
before them The SUV hits a bump Jane nearly flies out
Selvig grabs her yanks her back in

INT SUV 5 5
Jane grins thrilled pumped with adrenaline
JANE
Isnt this great A thought
strikes her
JANE (CONTD)

Youre seeing it too right Im
not crazy

SELVIG
Thats debateable Put your seat
belt on
The SUV lurches
EXT DESERT 6 6

Winds HOWL around the SUV now Up ahead spiraling down from
out of the clouds comes --

AN ENORMOUS TORNADO

Suffuse with the strange rainbow light ROARING like a
thousand freight trains as it touches down

INT SUV 7 7

Selvig looks up through the still-open sunroof at the
enormous glowing funnel cloud with wonder

Jane clambers into the front seat beside Darcy She leans

way out the window TAPING the storm

JANE
Youve gotta get us closer so I can
take a magnetic reading Darcy
laughs

DARCY
Yeah right Good one
(then realizing)
Oh God youre serious

JANE
You want those college credits or
not

EXT SUV 8

The SUV tears across a field towards the tornado

Jane

leaning out the window taping the event The SUV disturbs

two RAVENS perched on a cactus as they race past

The birds

take flight when -- KRAKABOOM A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING
strikes down through the center of the funnel cloud before

them with a terrifying intensity
INT SUV 9

The SUV rocks from the blast Darcys had enough
the wheel starts to head away

DARCY
Keep the credits Ill intern at
Burger King

JANE
What are you doing

DARCY
Saving our lives Jane grabs the
wheel jerks it hard the other way
They struggle for control when the
headlights fall on --

A MAN
Directly in their path stumbling
through the winds Darcy slams on
the brakes Jane turns the wheel
hard to avoid him The SUV swerves -
- but too late

She turns

EXT BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 10

The side of the SUV slams into the man with a THUD sending

him flying The car SKIDS to a stop

INT SUV 11

Jane Darcy and Selvig trade shocked looks breathing hard
They peer through the dust clouds unable to see through A
paralyzed moment then they all leap out of the car

EXT BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 12

The three race from the SUV with flashlights Jane spots the
man lying on the ground Hes dressed in tattered clothing

charred and blackened

DARCY

I think that was legally your

fault

JANE

For a moment they each forget to breathe
broken as Darcy returns with the kit

Get the first aid kit Darcy heads
back inside the SUV as Jane
concerned kneels next to the man
Selvig hovers protectively She
gently turns his head to the light
and we see him clearly for the
first time He is magnificently
handsome long blonde hair flowing
around his classically sculpted
features She cups her hands around
his face as if willing the life
back into him

JANE (CONTD)
Come on big guy Do me a favor and
dont be dead okay Open your eyes
and look at me Suddenly he
GROANS and shes startled then
relieved as his eyes flutter open
She looks deep into his confused
azure eyes which at last focus on
her own Locking onto them

sees how gorgeous the man is

DARCY
Wow Does he need CPR Because I
know CPR

The connection is
She freezes when she

A flustered Jane smooths her hair and sits back on her
heels She looks up at Selvig Back to being a scientist

JANE
HIS EYES--

DARCY
(DREAMILY)
--are beautiful

JANE
--are dilating Thats a good sign

SELVIG
We still have to get him toa
hospital

JANE
(HOPEFULLY )
After we get a reading on the
storm

SELVIG
Immediately Jane Jane sighs and
nods regretfully watching the
storm EVAPORATE above their heads
A thought strikes her

JANE
Where did he come from They
exchange puzzled looks as we move
up through the last glowing
remnants of the storm and into

EXT SPACE 13 13

EARTH spins slowly before us as we hear a voice deep and
resonant -- the voice of HEIMDALL Gatekeeper of Asgard

HEIMDALL (VO)
Questions theyve always asked
questions -- this race called man
on this planet they call earth
Passionately longing to know how
they are connected to the heavens

We pull away from the planet widening past other worlds
cosmic debris -- leaving first our solar system then our
galaxy

HEIMDALL (VO)
In ages past they looked to us as
gods for indeed so many times we
saved them from calamity

(MORE )

HEIMDALL (VO) (CONTD)
We tried to show them how their
world was but one of the Nine
Realms of the Cosmos linked to all
others by the branches of
Yggdrasil We pull back until we
see it -- YGGDRASIL Immense
sprawling like a quasar or a
nebula twisted into the vague shape
of a TREE its branches of glowing
energy stretching out into the
black void of space

HEIMDALL (VO)
the Worlds Tree Nine Realms in
a universe of wonder beauty and
terror that they barely
comprehended

We move in through Yggdrasil until we reach what looks like
a galaxy slowly spinning before us

HEIMDALL (VO)
But for all their thirst for
knowledge they let our lessons
fall into myth and dreams Where
did he come from He came from us
the proudest race of warriors the
Worlds have ever seen He came from
this -- the greatest Realm the
universe has ever known We move
through the galaxys mists and
astral matter then over and up
through a band of prismatic color
to reveal whats on the other side

HEIMDALL (VO) (CONTD)
He came from Asgard

EXT ASGARD - DAY 14 14

Beautiful beyond imagination We fly over the magnificent
landscape of the Realm through the gleaming capital city

modern yet timeless

EXT ODINS PALACE - DAY 15 15

The palace rises countless stories tall gleaming with an
other-worldly majesty towering high above the Realm
sprawled out before it We move towards a large window of
the palace where a FIGURE

STANDS --
ODIN ALLFATHER
Stares out at his kingdom The
ravens fly up to the balcony land
at his side
INT ODINS CHAMBERS - DAY 16 16

Odin turns away from the window His wife FRIGGA sits ata
vanity and tries different earrings before the mirror

ODIN
Do you think hes ready

FRIGGA
He thinks he is He has his
fathers confidence

ODIN
Hell need his fathers wisdom

FRIGGA
And his humility Odin reacts

FRIGGA (CONTD)
Thor wont be alone Loki will be
at his side to give him counsel
Have faith in your sons

ODIN
Yes but Thors still a boy He
could be a great King Odin

stops notices HIS HAND SHAKING It
seems to be out of synch temporally
with the rest of the world leaving
a trail as it moves He stares at
it determinedly concentrating
trying to stop the strange event
through the force of his sheer
will

Finally the occurrence subsides his hand normal once more
A worried Frigga covers his hand with her own

ODIN (CONTD)
(QUIETLY )
if we only had more time

FRIGGA
For once our son needs something
we cannot provide

ODIN
I can fight it a little longer

FRIGGA
No Youve put it off too long I
worry for you

He touches her cheek

ODIN
Ive destroyed demons and monsters
devastated whole worlds laid waste
to mighty kingdoms and still you
worry for me

FRIGGA
Always

ODIN
Not today Now come kiss your
king while Im still king He

pulls her close and they kiss
INT PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 17 17

Directly under the throne room a gloomily lit hall Banners
hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of
the fire lit room Giant doors open at one end A huge
figure silhouetted against the bright light beyond walks
forward In slo-mo we recognize the unmistakable shape of
the God of Thunder Hammer in hand he reaches the end of a
raised platform An ATTENDANT hands the figure a goblet of
wine He downs it quickly hurls it towards the fire
directly below

THOR
Another

The cup smashes the alcohol causes the fire to glow
intensely -- and for a moment brightly lit and seen full
length like a King to be is THE MIGHTY THOR He proceeds
down stops past camera and down the center of the Hall We
follow from behind and see at the other end massively
shadowed on one of the great banners the shape of two great
horns As Thor approaches the horn shapes move and then
from the shadows at the side emerges LOKI wearing his
horned headpiece Like Thor he is dressed for a great
ceremony They stand by a brazier at the foot of steps that
lead up to the crowded throne room

LOKI

(TO THOR)
Nervous brother

THOR
Have you ever known me to be
nervous

LOKI

There was the time in Nornheim

THOR
That wasnt nerves brother It was
the rage of battle How else could
I have fought my way through a
hundred warriors and pulled us out
alive

The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for
Thor

LOKI
As I recall I was the one who
veiled us in smoke to ease our

escape
THOR

Some do battle others just do

tricks

The Attendant stifles a laugh Loki notices doesnt like
it He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendants hand
EELS pour over the sides of the goblet slithering out and
across the terrified Attendants hand He SCREAMS hurls the
goblet to the ground Loki chuckles

THOR (CONTD)
Loki

Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground They turn
back to spilled wine the illusion shattered

THOR (CONTD)
Now that was just a waste of good
wine

LOKI
Just a bit of fun
(to the Attendant)
Right my friend The Attendant
isnt so sure Thor dons his EAGLE-
WINGED

HELMET
LOKI

(re Thors helmet)
Nice feathers

THOR
You dont really want to start this
again do you Cow

LOKI
I was being sincere

THOR
Youre incapable of sincerity

LOKI
Am I

He looks his brother in the eye all pretense lost

LOKI (CONTD)
Ive looked forward to this day as
long as you have Youre my brother
and my friend Sometimes Im
envious but never doubt that I
love you

Thor searches his brothers face sees no trace of irony
Hes either speaking from his heart or hes a very very
good liar Maybe both Thor puts an appreciative hand on his
brothers shoulder

THOR
Thank you

The two brothers take in the moment a beat then

LOKI
Give us a kiss

THOR
Stop

Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear

THOR (CONTD)
How do I look

LOKI
Like a king

They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN

LOKI (CONTD)
Its time

THOR
You go ahead
17A

Loki casts him a wary look

THOR (CONTD)
Ill be along Go on Loki heads
inside the palace without his
brother

INT ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 17A 17A

VOLSTAGG combs his great beard in preparation for the big
event As he does hes surprised to find a stray GRAPE
stuck in the beard He pulls it out looks around then
eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down FANDRAL
checks his reflection in a mirror smooths out his
moustache gives himself a dashing smile A PRETTY MAIDEN
holds the mirror before him as other MAIDENS look on
dreamily

FANDRAL
Thank you love
(to the Maidens)

FANDRAL (CONTD)
Now whod like to polish my sword
for me

The giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands HOGUN stands
staring ahead grimly his hands folded in front of him
amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS and the
ceremony preparations going on around him A HELPFUL
ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor
Hogun turns his head gives him a look Intimidated the
Attendant quickly backs away From behind we see a WOMAN IN
CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off her SWORD and set it on a table
then her SHIELD then several HIDDEN DAGGERS and small yet
intimidating WEAPONS We reveal that its SIF looking
radiant She eyes the weapons on the table

SIF
(to the weapons)
Ill miss you

INT THRONE ROOM - DAY 18 18

Colorful CEREMONIAL BANNERS of the Nine Realms adorn the
room crowded with AESIR and REPRESENTATIVES from across
Yggdrasil all BUZZING with excitement Thors COMRADES
enter and stride to their place of honor at the front of the
hall They are

THE WARRIORS THREE

VOLSTAGG has the girth and strength of a Sumo wrestler with
oversized passions to match

FANDRAL the consummate swashbuckler is agile charismatic
and nattily dressed HOGUN -- dark sullen brooding -- a
large MACE slung at his side With them walks the warrior
maiden SIF Shes clad in armor a shield and sword at her
side -- a beauty not to be trifled with

VOLSTAGG
I hope this goes quickly Im
famished

FANDRAL
(FEIGNED DISBELIEF)
Noooo

VOLSTAGG
Are you attached to that pretty
face of yours Because one more
word and you wont be

FANDRAL
(to the others)
My we are hungry arent we The
others laugh save Hogun Fandral
turns to him

FANDRAL (CONTD)
Go on Hogun Smile You can do it

Hogun stares at him grimly

FANDRAL (CONTD)
All right half a smile Look

Warriors Three are ready to meet
any challenge

FANDRAL
Name it Lady Sif

SIF
Keep your mouth shut

INT VAULT - DAY 19 19
Imposing EINHERJAR GUARDS clad in armor swords at the

ready stand watch inside the massive underground structure
beneath the palace A cold BREEZE blows past them

19A INT PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 19A 19A

Thor stands his fingers nervously drumming the handle of
his hammer Frigga approaches behind him sees his anxiety

FRIGGA
Its all right to be nervous

THOR
Why does everyone keep saying that
Im not nervous

FRIGGA
You may be able to fool the rest of

ASGARD --
THOR
»-but never you I know
FRIGGA
Thor just remember that you have
something even the great Allfather
never had
THOR
And what is that
FRIGGA
Me for a mother She smiles
FRIGGA (CONTD)
Now dont keep your father waiting
Frigga leaves
20 INT THRONE ROOM - DAY 20 20

Sif and the Warriors Three still wait before the crowd Loki
and Frigga enter Loki takes his place at the front of the
hall alongside the others With another blast of the horn
the crowd goes silent as the EINHERJAR HONOR GUARD moves
into formation They part to reveal --

ODIN
Sitting atop his throne clad in
full ceremonial armor He holds his
spear GUNGNIR before him Any trace
of weakness in him is gone now He
exudes all the power and majesty of
a Ruler of Asgard Frigga joins him
at his side He looks around the
hall casts a glance over to the
Warriors Thor is nowhere to be
seen Odin looks to Loki

(MORE )

ODIN (CONTD)
Loki shrugs Odin isnt pleased A
murmur spreads through the crowd

VOLSTAGG
(sotto to Loki)
Where is he

LOKI
He said hed be along Sif realizes
the truth shakes her head in

disapproval
VOLSTAGG
What
SIF

He wants to make an entrance

FANDRAL
Well if he doesnt show up soon
he shouldnt bother Odin looks
like hes ready to feed him to his
ravens

LOKI
I wouldnt worry Father will
forgive him He always does

Just then at the back of the hall up the steps from the
lower level --

MJOLNIR
Roars up into the hall Thor
strides cockily into the hall
behind it catching it behind his
back The CROWD erupts in CHEERS
Thor spins his hammer with a
flourish holds it up before the
crowd basking in the moment
relishing the adoration whipping
his audience up into a frenzy

SIF
Oh please

Odin watches from the front not liking this showy display
INT VAULT - DAY 21 21
As the sound of the cheers echo from above the odd cold

breeze picks up in the Vault The Guards rub their limbs to

warm themselves They grow increasingly uneasy sensing
somethings not right

They exchange a look then walk the length of the Vaults
hallway to its end where a CASKET sits undisturbed upon a

pedestal LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them They look

up and SHOUT in terror as they raise their weapons
INT THRONE ROOM - DAY 22 22

Thor finishes stirring up the crowd then reaches the front
of the room kneels on one knee before his mother and
father Frigga casts him an admonishing glance Thor winks
up at her She cant help but smile Odin strikes Gungnir
upon the ground with a deafening BOOM The crowd falls
silent Odin speaks with quiet effortless authority He
raises Gungnir before him

ODIN
Gungnir Its aim is true its power
strong With it I have defended
Asgard and the lives of the
innocent across the Nine Realms
since the time of the Great
Beginning And though the day has
come for a new King to wield his
own weapon -- that duty remains the
same Thor Odinson my heir my
first-born

ODIN (CONTD)
So long entrusted with this mighty
hammer Mjollnir Forged in the
heart of a dying star from the
sacred metal of Uru Only one may
lift it Only one is worthy Who
wields this hammer commands the
lightning and the storm Its power
has no equal -- as a weapon to
destroy or as a tool to build It
is a fit companion for a King

INT VAULT - DAY 23 23

The bodies of the Guards are flung to the Vaults floor now
strewn with ice We dont see their attackers clearly just
catch glimpses of them in the shadows -- but they are large
and BLUE-SKINNED One of the creatures lifts the Casket off
its stand and turns to go But as they do the intricate
latticework behind the Casket starts to separate and
retract revealing something standing in the shadows behind
it As the creatures walk away a fiery glow rises behind
them They turn back around Now its their turn to SCREAM

INT THRONE ROOM - DAY 24 24

The Ceremony continues

ODIN
Today I entrust you with the
greatest honor in all the Nine
Realms The sacred throne of
Asgard I have sacrificed much to
achieve peace So too must a new
generation sacrifice to maintain
that peace Responsibility duty
honor These are not merely virtues
to which we must aspire They are
essential to every soldier and to
every King The Crowd and the
Warriors Three start to shiver and
rub their limbs for warmth in the
increasingly cold air of the hall

Thor turns back to face his father Odin looks upon his son
with pride

ODIN (CONTD)
Thor Odinson do you swear to guard
the Nine Realms

THOR
I swear
ODIN
Do you swear to preserve the peace
THOR
I swear
ODIN

Do you swear to cast aside all
selfish ambition and pledge
yourself only to the good of all
the Realms

Beat

THOR
I swear

ODIN
Then on this day I Odin
Allfather proclaim you-- Odin
hesitates noticing a strange sight
before him ICE creeps across the
surface of the large banners around
the hall making an eerie CRACKING
sound Thor his comrades and the
crowd see it too

INT VAULT - DAY 25B 25B

Thor enters then stares shocked at the sight before him
Sif the Warriors Three and Loki hurry in behind Thor and
stop short Shattered and melting ICE is strewn about the
floor We dont see the blue-skinned bodies of the Frost
Giants clearly just catch glimpses of their twisted and
smoldering remains on the floor Theyve just lost a savage
battle Badly Amidst them shrouded in shadow stands the
black metal creature a fiery glow coming from within it It
is THE DESTROYER It holds the Casket in its hands

SIF
The Destroyer

VOLSTAGG

(AWED )
I thought it was but a legend Odin
steps in behind the Asgardians as
the Destroyer sets the Casket back
on its pedestal It moves back to
its post the faint FIERY GLOW
extinguishes within it Fandral
looks around the Vault ill at
ease

FANDRAL
Ive never been inside the Vault
before Its said the Tesseract was
once held here

VOLSTAGG
(AWED )
The Tesseract I thought that was
but a legend too

SIF
Shush

Odin surveys the destruction
THOR
The Jotuns must pay for what
theyve done

ODIN
They have paid with their lives
The Destroyer did its job and the
Casket is safe All is well

THOR
All is well7t They broke into
the Weapons Vault If the Frost
Giants had stolen even one of these

RELICS--

ODIN
But they didnt

THOR
I want to know why they--

ODIN
(INTERRUPTING)
The Casket of Ancient Winters
belonged to the Jotuns They
believe its their birthright

THOR
And if you hadnt taken it from
them they would have laid waste to
all the Nine Realms

ODIN
I have a truce with Laufey the
Jotun King

THOR
He just broke your truce We must
act

Odin turns to Sif and the Warriors Three

ODIN
Leave us

Thors comrades exit Odin eyes Thor as Loki watches

ODIN (CONTD)
And what action would you take

THOR
March into Jotunheim as you once
did teach them a lesson break
their spirits so theyll never dare
try to cross our borders again

ODIN
Youre thinking only as a warrior
THOR
This was an act of war
ODIN
It was the act of but a few doomed
to fail
THOR

They got this far

ODIN
We will find the breach in our
defenses It will be found and it
will be sealed

THOR
As King of Asgard I would--

ODIN
You are not King Not yet Thor
sees in his fathers face that hes
pushed this as far as he can He
backs away then leaves pushing
through the doors so hard that they
SLAM backwards behind him Odin
watches him go

INT BANQUET HALL - DAY 26 26

Thor stands in the empty hall bearing the signs of the
festivities cancelled due to the events of the day Anger
and frustration rising within him Thor upends one of the
massive tables From across the room Loki watches him

AT THE BANQUET HALL ENTRANCE

Sif Fandral and Hogun follow Volstagg as he enters in
search of his dinner

SIF
Redecorating are we Volstagg
surveys the overturned tables and
food aghast

VOLSTAGG
Whats this --

HOGUN
I told you theyd cancel it

FANDRAL
We thought that was just you being
your normal cheery self Volstagg
looks about the floor despairing

VOLSTAGG
All this food -- so innocent cast
to the ground It breaks the heart

Thor strides away from them to the far end of the hall Loki
calmly moves towards him

THOR
Its unwise to be in my company
right now brother

LOKI
Who said I was wise

THOR
(re the empty hall)
This was to be my day of triumph

LOKI
It will come In time

(ADMITS)

If its any consolation I think
youre right About the Frost
Giants about Laufey everything
If a few of them could penetrate
the defenses of Asgard once whos
to say they wont try again Next
time with an army

THOR
Yes exactly

LOKI
But theres nothing we can do
without defying Father Thor
considers this looks at his
hammer a gleam in his eye Loki
can guess what hes thinking grows
concerned

LOKI (CONTD)
No stop there I know that look

THOR
Its the only way to ensure the
safety of our borders

LOKI
Its madness

VOLSTAGG
Madness What sort of madness

LOKI
Nothing Thor was making a jest

THOR
The safety of our Realm is no jest
Were going to Jotunheim

FANDRAL
What

SIF
Thor of all the laws of Asgard
this is one you must not break
Loki looks on intrigued by the
proceedings

FANDRAL
This isnt like a journey to Earth
where you summon a little lightning
and thunder and the mortals worship
you as a god This is Jotunheim

VOLSTAGG
And if the Frost Giants dont kill
you your Father will

THOR
My father fought his way into
Jotunheim defeated their armies
and took their Casket Wed just be
looking for answers

SIF
It is forbidden Thor sizes up his
friends smiles He proceeds to
make his case with enthusiasm and
charismatic conviction

THOR
My friends have you forgotten all
that weve done together He turns
to Fandral

THOR (CONTD)
Who brought you into the sweet
embrace of the most exotic maidens
in all of Yggdrasil

FANDRAL
You did

THOR
(TO HOGUN)
Who led you into the most glorious
of battles

(TO VOLSTAGG)
and to delicacies so succulent
you thought youd died and gone to

Valhalla

VOLSTAGGHOGUN
You did You did He turns to
Sif

THOR

And who proved wrong all who
scoffed at the idea that a young
maiden could be one of the fiercest
warriors this Realm has ever known

SIF
I did
THOR
(QUICKLY)

True But I supported you
(then to the others)

My friends trust me now We must

do this

The others exchange concerned looks realize theres no
convincing him

THOR (CONTD)
Come on Youre not going to let my
brother and me take all the glory
are you

Loki looks startled

LOKI
What

THOR
You are coming with me

LOKI
Yes of course I wont let my
brother march into Jotunheim alone
I will be at his side

VOLSTAGG
And I
FANDRAL
And I
HOGUN
And I The Warriors Three fight
together
SIF

I fear well live to regret this

VOLSTAGG
If were lucky

Thor Sif Loki and the Warriors Three walk from the

Palace across the grounds

They reach a group of ATTENDANTS

who ready their battle gear for their journey Loki slips
away from the group speaks to a nearby GUARD Hogun

notices

Volstagg

THOR
We must first find a way to get
past Heimdall

VOLSTAGG
That will be no easy task Its
said the Gatekeeper can see a
single dew drop fall from a blade
of grass a thousand worlds away

FANDRAL
And he can hear a cricket passing
gas in Niffelheim

VOLSTAGG
Jest not He heareth all

FANDRAL
Please Getting past him should be
simple enough now since he seems
to be letting Frost Giants sneak by
under his nose

terrified calls out to the sky

VOLSTAGG
Forgive him He meaneth no offense

Loki rejoins the group as Thor leads them onward
EXT GATE OF ASGARD - DAY 28 28

Thor and his band of adventurers on horseback pass through
the massive Gate leaving Asgard behind They ride along the
most astounding path in this Realm or any other --

THE RAINBOW BRIDGE

Wide and flat it runs straight out from Odins palace to
the mists and black void of space beyond In the distance
far ahead the Bridge continues on until it reaches
Heimdalls Observatory

EXT HEIMDALLS OBSERVATORY - DAY 29 29

The band draws near the Observatory where HEIMDALL himself
Gatekeeper of Asgard stands at his post on the Bridge
before them blocking their way staring them down There is
something other-worldly about him even for this Realm He
holds a massive sword in front of him his stern
intimidating face virtually concealed by armor Something
glints beneath his visor like twinkling stars

LOKI
Keep your weapons sheathed and your
mouths closed This is going to
take subtlety and sincerity not
brute strength Leave it to me
Loki dismounts and steps forward

LOKI (CONTD)
GOOD HEIMDALL--

HEIMDALL
Youre not dressed warmly enough
Thor Loki and the others trade
looks

LOKI
Im sorry

HEIMDALL

The freezing cold of Jotunheim It
will kill you all in time even
Thor

(THEN)
You think you can deceive me I
who watch all

(MORE )
(THEN) (CONTD)
I who can sense the flapping of a
butterflys wings a thousand worlds
away He fixes his eyes pointedly
at Fandral

HEIMDALL
Or can hear a cricket passing gas
in Niffelheim

Fandral looks gob-smacked

Loki goes

FANDRAL
That was just a bit of a jest
really

into damage control

LOKI
You must be mistaken Were not--

THOR
(STEPPING FORWARD)
Enough

(TO HEIMDALL)
Heimdall may we pass Heimdall
stares him down

HEIMDALL
For ages have I guarded Asgard and
kept it safe from those who would
do it harm In all that time never
has an enemy slipped by my watch --
until this day I wish to know how
that happened

THOR
Then tell no one where weve gone
until weve returned Thor walks
past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper
lets the group pass Volstagg walks
beside the frustrated Loki needles
him

VOLSTAGG
What happened Your silver tongue
turn to lead

LOKI
Get me off this bridge before it
cracks under your girth Volstagg
and Fandral share a laugh

INT HEIMDALLS OBSERVATORY - DAY 30 30

Thor and the others enter the Observatory step onto a
platform Heimdall climbs into the large control apparatus
at the center of the room and readies the Observatory

HEIMDALL
Be warned I will honor my sworn
oath to protect this Realm as its
Gatekeeper If your return
threatens the safety of Asgard
Bifrost will remain closed to you
Youll be left to die in the cold
wastes of Jotunheim

THOR
I have no plans to die today

HEIMDALL
None do

Heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel and the
apparatus of the Observatory starts up

EXT RAINBOW BRIDGE 31 31

The Bifrost energy quickens along the Bridge feeding into
the Observatory

INT HEIMDALLS OBSERVATORY 32 32

Heimdall turns his sword in the control panel The
Observatorys giant turret swings around aims toward a
section of space As a final step Heimdall plunges his
sword deeper into the control panel The great turret FIRES
the RAINBOW LIGHT of Bifrost energy blasts out of it The
Bifrost opens at the end of the platform upon which Thor and
his five comrades stand

HEIMDALL
All is ready You may pass

VOLSTAGG
Couldnt you just leave the bridge
open for us

HEIMDALL
To keep this bridge open would
unleash the full power of the
Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with
you upon it

VOLSTAGG
Ah Never mind then Thor starts
towards the Bifrost turns back to
the others grins

THOR
Come on Dont be bashful The
others join him at his side then
step towards the Bifrost Their
bodies stretch towards the
maelstrom changing shape as if
every atom of their being is being
elongated by the pull of it In an
instant theyre jerked off the
platform and inside the vortex

EXT BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 33 33

A hole in the sky rips open and the Bifrost comes shooting
out of it Snow flurries up when the Bifrost hits as Thor
and his band touch down RUNES from the Bifrost are
imprinted on the ice around them

Volstagg loses his footing falling backwards Thor quickly
grabs him by the belt We see the warrior dangling
precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff on the planets
inner ring opening up to the black abyss of space beyond

THOR
Come on big fella Up With an
effort Thor pulls the burly
warrior back onto the ice and
tremendously relieved he
proclaims

VOLSTAGG
This belt This belt is now my
lucky belt I will never remove it
Even when bathing

FANDRAL
You bathe

Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder
at the frozen alien wasteland before them The whole planet
is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice slowly breaking
apart Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges
and float off into space The planets icy surface cracks
and melts as far as the eye can see The ruins of a Jotun
city lies in the distance

HOGUN
We shouldnt be here

THOR
Too late now

FANDRAL
Actually its not We could turn
right around hop back to Asgard
share a mug by the fire Could be
nice

Thor ignore him heads off Loki looks around anxious

LOKI
Perhaps we should wait Thor turns
back to his brother

THOR
For what

LOKI
To survey the enemy To gauge their
strengths and weaknesses from a
distance

VOLSTAGG
Im liking that Gauging
surveying Particularly the
distance part

THOR
We know all we must Its time to
act

Thor heads on Reluctantly the others follow

SIF
Hes just got to swing his
hammer

EXT JOTUNHEIM - DAY 34 34

The group trudges behind Thor across the frozen wasteland
shielding themselves from the howling wind and cold Loki
looks around them anxious Volstagg shivers Thor
invigorated turns back to his comrades

THOR
It feels good doesnt it To be
together again adventuring on
another world

FANDRAL
Adventuring Is that what were
doing
THOR
What would you call it

FANDRAL
Freezing

VOLSTAGG
Starving

SIF
Whining

THOR

How about a song to lift our
spirits

The others groan

HOGUN
No not that

SIF
Please dont make us sing again

FANDRAL
If I have to listen to Volstaggs
singing voice one more time Ill
fall on my own sword

SIF
Well now Im on board She and
Thor share a grin The party
reaches the edge of the city -- its
ancient structures of jade and ice
melting and crumbling ravaged by
warfare long ago A TEMPLE lies
before them across a central
plaza

SIF (CONTD)
Where are they

THOR
Hiding As cowards always do Thor
leads the others onwards towards
the central plaza Loki reluctantly
follows They dont notice as
SHADOWY FIGURES move in the shadows
of the structures nearby

35 EXT CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY 35 35

The party reaches the plaza They sense the Frost Giants in

the shadows and crevices

surrounding them now on all sides

The Asgardians reach for the hilts of their weapons A JOTUN
SENTRY calls to him

JOTUN SENTRY
What is your business here
Asgardian

The Jotuns voice itself sounds like cracking ice

THOR
I speak only to your King Not to
his foot soldiers

JOTUN VOICE (OS)
Then speak

Thor turns towards the source in a balcony of the temple
where LAUFEY sits veiled in shadow behind a cascading
waterfall The Jotun King is ancient noble powerful -- too
proud to reveal even a hint of the years of suffering he and
his people have endured

LAUFEY

I am Laufey King of this Realm
THOR

And I am--
LAUFEY

We know who you are Odinson Why
have you brought the stench of your
blood into my world

THOR
I demand answers Laufey stands
sizing up Thor tries to piece this
together

LAUFEY
You demand7t

THOR
How did your people get into
Asgard

LAUFEY
The house of Odin is full of
traitors

Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a puzzled look
disturbed by the Jotun Kings words

THOR
Do not dishonor my fathers name
with your lies

LAUFEY
Your father is a murderer and a
thief He stole what was ours and
left our world in ruins We have
the right to reclaim the Casket

THOR
Not when youd use it to make war
against other Realms Laufey
laughs cold mocking

LAUFEY
And why have you come here To make
peace You long for battle You
crave it I see you for what you
are Thor Odinson Nothing but a
boy trying to prove himself a man

THOR
This boy has grown tired of your
mockery

Thor takes a step towards Laufey The other Jotuns step in
front of Thor blocking his path We finally see the Frost
Giants now -- terrifying blue-skinned standing eight feet
tall Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores
him

LOKI
Thor stop and think Look around
you We are outnumbered

THOR
Know your place brother

LAUFEY
You should listen to his counsel
You know not what your actions
would unleash

Laufey steps out of the shadows
LAUFEY (CONTD)
But I do Go now while I still

allow it

Thor simmers Loki speaks up

LOKI
We will accept your most gracious
offer

The others look to Thor imploringly Thor stares Laufey down
a beat -- then relents He turns to leave His comrades
breathe a sigh of relief and follow when a Frost Giant
nearby mutters under his breath

JOTUN
Run back home little princess
Thor stops in his tracks Loki goes
white He knows whats coming

LOKI
Damn

In one quick move Thor pulls Mjolnir swings it and KNOCKS
the Jotun clear across the plaza The Asgardians reluctantly
draw their weapons gather into a circle around Thor
Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them

VOLSTAGG
Silly hammer Has a mind of its
own

ICE forms on the Jotuns bodies creating a FROZEN ARMOR
around them extending off the ends of their arms like
SWORDS One Giant does so directly in front of Fandral

FANDRAL
Im hoping thats just decorative
Thor leaves the circle of
Asgardians swings at another Frost
Giant His comrades form another
circle around him separating him
from the Jotuns as he whirls his
hammer around once and catches it
with a cocky grin Hes enjoying
this

THOR
Next

Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun

FANDRAL
Well What move do you think

VOLSTAGG
I say we use The Norns
Revenge7u

FANDRAL
At this close range I think The
Alfheim Lunge7“t is a better move

VOLSTAGG
(DISGUSTED)
Maybe if they were three feet tall
No How about The Randy
Valkyrie-U

HOGUN
Shut up

Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant then all hell breaks
loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle A Jotun
backs Hogun up against a wall of ice As the Giant hurls an
ice blade fist at him the grim warrior swings his mace over
his head embedding it into the ice wall and hoists himself
up dodging the Giants blow and leaping over him Hogun
takes out a second approaching Frost Giant spins back
dodges a swing from the first then pounds the Jotun with
his mace Nearby Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another
with her double-bladed staff One knocks her viciously to
the ground

SIF
If you dont treat me like a lady
I wont act like a lady She takes
out the Jotun Loki backs away from
an approaching Jotun finds himself
at the edge of a deep crevasse The
Giant sees hes vulnerable swipes
at him But the Jotuns arm passes
right through him The Giant stands
there confused when THE REAL LOKI
comes out from behind a structure
and shoves the Giant into the
crevasse below The false Loki
dissipates into nothingness

LOKI
(to the falling Giant)
Pathetic

He turns back to the battle Two Jotuns come at him from
either side He lets two daggers fly felling both Giants at
once Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun
BRUTE The Brute leaps down from the balcony icing himself
up then punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his
feet Its a long-range attack causing PILLARS OF ICE to
explode out in front of Hogun sending the grim warrior
flying back Across the plaza Thor easily dispatches some
Jotuns

THOR
Come on At least make it a
challenge for me He sees the Brute
coming at him The huge Jotun lands
a tremendous blow sending Thor
back across the ice Thor rises
grins

THOR (CONTD)
Now thats more like it He throws
Mjolnir with all his strength
knocking the Brute head over heels
Thor raises his hand Mjolnir slows
in mid-air then flies back to his

grasp

THOR (CONTD)

(re the fallen Brute)
Ugly and stupid Sif takes out a
couple Frost Giants but shes
knocked to the ground by another
It raises its weapon above her
Hogun sees Sif in danger He pulls
a HIDDEN KNIFE from his sleeve and
hurls it at Sifs attacker hitting
him square in the chest The Jotun
falls dead

SIF
(to Hogun re knife)
Im so glad I taught him how to do
that

Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant getting a couple good
hits in

VOLSTAGG
You may want to put some ice on
that

The Frost Giant fights back but Volstagg manages to grip in
a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind
Volstagg fends him off then turns the first one loose

VOLSTAGG (CONTD)
You may be taller but Im wider
Volstagg launches his mighty belly
at the Jotun and sends him flying

Another Jotun grabs Volstagg squeezing him tightly and
sending him crashing to the ground

VOLSTAGG (CONTD)
Its not too late for you to
surrender

Volstagg recovers and fights on The Jotun grabs Volstaggs
bare arm The warriors skin begins to freeze from the
Jotuns grasp a BLACKNESS spreading from it necrotizing
Volstaggs flesh The warrior SHOUTS in pain

Volstagg head-butts the Frost Giant shattering the Jotuns
ice helmet and dropping him to the ground Winded he takes
a seat upon one of the fallen Jotuns bodies to catch his
breath As the battle rages around him he opens a secret
compartment at the end of his weapon takes out a small
FLASK Volstagg grimaces in pain sees his blackened skin
He yells to his comrades

VOLSTAGG (CONTD)
Dont let them grab hold of you He
takes a swig enjoying the brief
respite then rejoins the battle

Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giants chest but the sword
stops mid ice layer The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow
to Volstaggs face and the warrior drops to one knee Sif
sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him In one
quick move she leaps up and off of Volstaggs back using
her boot to plunge Volstaggs blade deep into the Giants
chest standing atop him as he falls backwards to the
ground

VOLSTAGG (CONTD)
(on his belly)
Thank you my lady But I nearly
had him

SIF
Of course you did Nearby a Frost
Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE
BULLETS hurling them at Sif Sif
raises her shield barely in time
as the bullets go pinging and
ricocheting off it She races into
the group of Frost Giants who
attacked her and takes them out

A Frost Giant touches a pool of standing water It FLASH-
FREEZES Hoguns feet to the ground Volstagg notices
hurries over dispatching Jotuns as he goes

VOLSTAGG
Hang on

Volstagg swings his weapon wildly hacking at the ice around
Hoguns legs to free him Hogun looks down suddenly
worried as Volstaggs blade cuts deep -- and perilously
close to hacking into Hoguns legs

HOGUN
Watch the legs

VOLSTAGG
(REALIZING)
Right Sorry

Volstagg chips away at the ice more carefully finally
freeing Hoguns feet Fandral sword fights with a Frost
Giant

FANDRAL
You really think your icicles are a
match for Asgardian steel Fandral
lunges at the Giant The Jotun
knocks his blade away

FANDRAL (CONTD)
Fair enough

Fandral moves on him again but the Giant grabs Fandrals
sword and snaps it in half

FANDRAL (CONTD)
Could we stop just a moment while I
get another sword Fandral fights
the Giant with his broken sword
The Jotun then lunges at Fandral
who ducks just in time grabs hold
of the Giants sword and redirects
it stabbing the Giant through with
his own weapon The Jotun staggers
back then reaches down and swipes
at a pool of water sending up a
spray that freezes in mid-air
forming into an ICE STALAGMITE It
impales Fandral rendering him
helpless

Loki races towards the impaled Fandral throwing daggers and
felling Frost Giants as he goes He reaches the nearly-
unconscious warrior when other Jotuns approach He fights
them off Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the
impaled Fandral

VOLSTAGG
Thats unfortunate He hurries to
his wounded comrade

FANDRAL
I may need a bit of help Nota
good look is it

VOLSTAGG
Just try not to bleed

FANDRAL
Hows the face

VOLSTAGG
Flawless

Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice
stalagmite Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one
of the Frost Giants The Giant grabs hold of Lokis gloved
wrists Loki pulls his hands free of the gloves which are
still in the Giants grasp revealing Lokis skin beneath
The wounded Jotun sees his chance grabs hold of Lokis bare
arm Loki looks at his arm prepared for the worst But
instead of the blackness of necrotizing flesh Lokis arm
turns BLUE -- like the Frost Giants own skin The blueness
spreads painlessly up Lokis arm He stares at it confused
The Frost Giant is thrown as well distracted by the
unexpected phenomenon Loki takes advantage of the
distraction KICKS the Giant

Thor continues fighting his blood lust rising He taunts
the Jotuns around him

THOR
Come on

But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun the Frost
Giants seize the opportunity A group of Jotuns swarm Thor
from all sides keeping him separate from his weapon
Mjolnir falls to the ground A Frost Giant desperately
struggles to lift Mjolnir off the ground to no avail Now
free the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg slings
him over his shoulder and the warriors start to leave From
his balcony Laufey looks upon the battlefield decides its
time to pull out the big guns He touches a wall of the
palace An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch across the
wall of the palace and down to the ground below The
Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their feet

LOKI
That cant be good

VOLSTAGG
Yes it could Might be an early
spring

They look down suddenly filled with dread when they see
shadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN
WARRIORS awakening beneath the surface rousing to join the
battle Loki turns to his brother who battles a group of
the Giants

LOKI

Thor we must go Thor still
without his hammer fights his
Jotun foes mercilessly a man
consumed by blood lust Loki sees
the look on his brothers face --
the savage thrill of the heat of
battle

THOR
Then go

SIF
There are too many of them

THOR
I can stop them The others
hesitate Jotuns break up through
the ice all around them

SIF
Thor

But Thor ignores his comrades continues fighting

VOLSTAGG
Run

Reluctantly the group flees back toward the inner edge of

the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give

chase Thor battles valiantly but theres just too many of
them The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now as he

disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice After a

MOMENT --

THORS FIST
Forces its way up through the
middle of the pile of Jotuns He
opens his hand beckoning One of
Thors attackers hears something
ROARING up behind him He whirls
around -- BAM -- Mjolnir nails him
square in the face then flies into
Thors outstretched hand Thor
raises the hammer up high and
brings it down on the ground with
all his might KRAKABOOM

(MORE )

THORS FIST (CONTD)
Lightning strikes down from the
sky the hammer channeling the
blast firing the electricity out
at the Jotuns around him Theyre
blasted back in a massive
shockwave The Jotuns convulse
drop dead to the ground

But the force of the blast also cracks the ice below the
shockwave continuing to spread outwards It moves out to
where his comrades are running breaking up the ground
beneath them exposing the black void of space below

VOLSTAGG
Whats Thor done

LOKI
Likely killed us all As the Jotuns
race towards the Asgardians they
open their mouths wide and breathe
out an ICY FOG The swirling mists
quickly engulf the fleeing
Asgardians before them The
Asgardians stand in the mist
unable to see Hogun takes a step
back the ice cracking beneath him
They dare not move for fear of
falling through into the void
below Thor sees hes put his
friends in even greater danger He
raises Mjolnir high SUMMONING THE
WINDS They lift him off the ground
and carry him across the frozen
wasteland to his comrades

35A EXT BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 35A 35A
Thor lands beside his comrades in the shroud of mists

THOR
Loki we have to see Loki raises
his arms concentrates the mists
dissipating But as they do the
Asgardians see before them the
faces of the Frost Giants And
there are HUNDREDS of them -- too
many even for a Thunder God

VOLSTAGG
(TO LOKI)
Actually could you bring the mists
back please

Thor realizes that he and his comrades are as good as dead
The Giants move in for the kill when they hear a deafening
ROAR A hole in the sky opens up and the Bifrost blasts
down onto the inner edge of the planet Out of the maelstrom
comes the sound of THUNDERING HOOVES and to the shock of
all tearing across the frozen wasteland comes --

ODIN ALLFATHER
Astride his powerful eight-legged
steed SLEIPNIR Hes clad in battle
armor Gungnir in his hand -- an
imposing sight

The Giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks
stopping before Laufey and the Asgardians Laufey slams his
fists into the ground and the ice beneath his feet raises
him towards Odin The Asgardians start to react thinking
its an attack but Laufey just stands face- to-face with
Odin Asgardian and Jotun alike look on uneasily unsure
whats about to happen Laufey sizes up Odin notices that
as powerful as the Allfather still is the years have taken
their toll Hes not the foe he once was The two rulers
talk quietly out of earshot of the others

ODIN
Laufey End this

LAUFEY
Your boy sought this out

ODIN
Youre right These are the actions
of a boy Treat them as such You
and I can stop this before theres
further bloodshed Unseen by Odin
and the others Laufey starts to
form an ice blade at the end of his
arm

LAUFEY
We are beyond diplomacy now
Allfather Hell get what he came
for -- war and death Odin looks
grim determined

ODIN
So be it

Without warning Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin but
Odin is quicker The Allfather brings his spear down upon
the ice Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards
in a wave the ice cracking beneath their feet The other
Frost Giants turn tail and run Thor watches the fleeing
Jotuns with delight

THOR
Now Well finish them together

ODIN
Silence

Odin raises his spear The hole in the sky opens the
Bifrost energy blasting forth from it The Bifrost envelops
the Asgardians yanks them off the ground and up through the
hole The vortex closes behind them as all falls silent
Laufey stares up after them contemptuously

INT HEIMDALLS OBSERVATORY - DAY 36 36

Heimdall stands at the Observatory controls Odin pulls
Heimdalls sword from the control panel and throws it to
him Heimdall backs away

THOR
Why did you bring us back

ODIN
Do you realize what youve done
What youve started

THOR
I was protecting my home

ODIN
You cannot protect your friends
How can you hope to protect a
kingdom

Odin turns to the others

ODIN (CONTD)
(RE FANDRAL)
Get him to the healing room Sif
Volstagg and Hogun hurry to help
Fandral out of the room

THOR
There wont be a kingdom to protect
if youre afraid to act Odin
stares at him

THOR (CONTD)
Whatever the cost the world must
know that the new King of Asgard
will not be held in contempt

ODIN
Thats pride and vanity that talks
Not leadership

(MORE )

ODIN (CONTD)
Have you forgotten everything Ive
taught you What of a warriors
patience cunning

THOR
While you wait and be patient the
Nine Realms laugh at us The old
ways are done Youd stand giving
speeches while Asgard falls

ODIN
Youre a vain greedy cruel boy

THOR
And you are an old man and a fool
The whole world seems to stop at
Thors words Odin falls quiet
When he speaks again theres
something terrifying beneath the
calmness of his words

ODIN
A fool yes I was a fool to think
you were ready

Loki takes a step towards Odin imploringly

LOKI
FATHER--

Odin turns and gives Loki a look which stops him in his
tracks

ODIN
Thor Odinson You have disobeyed
the express command of your King
Through your arrogance and
stupidity you have opened these
peaceful Realms and innocent lives
to the horrors of war The
Allfather plunges Gungnir into
Observatorys control panel The
turret turns the Bifrost energy
building along with Odins rage It
FIRES as the Bifrost opens at the
end of the platform creating a
portal behind Thor Odin turns
angrily to his son

ODIN (CONTD)
You are unworthy of this Realm
Odin RIPS a disc off Thors chest

ODIN (CONTD)
»unworthy of your title He
rips away Thors cloak

ODIN (CONTD)
»unworthy of the loved ones
youve betrayed I hereby take from
you your powers Odin extends his
hand towards his son Mjolnir goes
flying from Thors grasp into
Odins hand

ODIN (CONTD)
In the name of my father A
FINGER OF LIGHTNING comes off the
hammer and hits Thor
disintegrating the right arm of his
armor and part of the chest piece

ODIN (CONTD)
and of his father before
Another strike disintegrates the
remainder of Thors armor
including the cape and torn-away
disc on the floor

ODIN (CONTD)
I cast you out

Odin thrusts Mjolnir before him and -- with a CRACK OF
THUNDER -- Thor is hurled backwards into the open Bifrost
and disappears in the vortex

Odin holds Mjolnir in his hand stares at it bitterly He
closes his eyes lost in contemplation whispers something
quietly

ODIN (CONTD)
(WHISPERING)
Whosoever holds this hammer if he
be worthy shall possess the power
of Thor

RUNES appear on the side of the hammer as if carved into
its smooth surface The runes linger for but a moment then
disappear Suddenly Odin turns and hurls the hammer into
the Bifrost

CUT TO BLACK
EXT BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - NIGHT 37 37

Thor opens his eyes surrounded by darkness Suddenly hes
blinded by bright headlights of a vehicle -- an SUV
It swerves the side of it coming straight at him
into him as we

It SLAMS

CUT TO BLACK

After a beat we hear familiar voices

DARCY (VO)
I think that was legally your
fault

JANE (VO)

Jane regretfully watches the storm EVAPORATE above their

heads A thought strikes her

JANE

(TO SELVIG)
Where did he come from They
exchange puzzled looks when Thor
GROANS again He sits up abruptly
and Jane topples backwards in
surprise Thor staggers groggily to
his feet then turns and offers
Jane a hand up She takes it
hesitantly and he easily pulls her
up She cant help but marvel at
his strength

JANE (CONTD)
Uh thanks Are you okay Thor
searches the ground

THOR

JANE
Erik look at this He joins her
at her side and sees it A faint
discernible pattern is etched into
the sand They exchange a look
Amazed and excited Jane hurriedly
takes out a camera and snaps some
photos of the runes A breeze
begins to blow them away

JANE (CONTD)
Weve got to move fast before

JANE (CONTD)

Jane kneels and quickly scoops up a soil sample in the
cannister

JANE

He hurls one of them off smashing against a wall Nowa
couple SECURITY GUARDS and MALE NURSES join the fracas all
struggling to hold Thor down Medical equipment goes flying
furniture overturned

ORDERLY
What the hell is this guy on
Finally they force him back down
onto the gurney Thor looks shocked

overpowered by this small group
The NURSE injects him with a
sedative

The Townie approaches something at the center of the crater
We dont see what it is but it bathes him in an

EXTINT SMITH MOTORS - LAB - MORNING 45 45

The distant mountains glint snow in the early morning light
Selvig appears with a cup of coffee and surveys the vast
desert He turns back into the lab and sees Jane busy at
her workstation soldering a piece of equipment A printer
churns out blown-up screen-cap PHOTOS of the Bifrost
footage Darcy hangs them on the wall Selvig surveys the
scene watches how Jane works impressed He notices a
monitor which displays a complex program entitled J FOSTER
ALGORITHM ANALYSIS-t He looks proud The three of them
have been up all night fueled by caffeine and excitement

JANE
Darcy when youre done take the
soil samples to Professor Meyers in
geology Remind him he owes me

SELVIG
We might want to perform a spectral
analysis

JANE
We70

SELVIG

I flew all the way out here --
might as well make myself useful
This is the offer Janes been
waiting for She gets up inserts
the piece of equipment shes been
working on into a rack-mounted
server

JANE
You know what would be really
useful Do you still have that
friend at LIGO

SELVIG
She was more than a friend

JANE
Could you call in a favor

SELVIG
You dont think this was just a
magnetic storm

JANE
If Im right their observatory
must have picked up gravitational
waves during last nights event

SELVIG
Meaning

Jane heads over to a computer monitor Selvig follows

JANE
Meaning these anomalies might
signify something bigger

SELVIG
How big7-U are we talking about
Jane indicates the footage on the
monitor As the last of the Bifrost
cloud disappears into the night
sky there appears to be a blister
in space bulging out in convex and
covered with stars

JANE
I think the lensing around the
edges is characteristic of an
Einstein-Rosen Bridge

DARCY
A what

SELVIG
I thought you were a science major

DARCY
Political Science Selvig shoots
Jane a confused look Jane shrugs

JANE
She was the only applicant
SELVIG
(TO DARCY)
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge -- a

theoretical7“t connection between
two different points of space-time

(TO DARCY)
A wormhole

Selvig looks skeptical Jane prints out a frame-grab off the
monitor

Jane indicates the print-out showing the constellations seen
through the bubble7-t in the clouds

JANE (CONTD)
What do you see here

SELVIG
Stars

JANE
Yes But not our stars She spreads
out a STAR CHART barely able to
contain her excitement

JANE (CONTD)
This is the star alignment for our
quadrant this time of year So
unless Ursa Minor decided to take
the day off those are someone
elses constellations Selvigs
intrigued in spite of himself
Darcy pulls another frame-grab of
the Bifrost footage from the
printer and hangs it on the wall
when something in the image catches
her eye

DARCY
Hey check it out Jane and Selvig
examine the photo amazed

SELVIG
Is that

I think I left something at the

hospital
As Jane walks away we REVEAL the photo Inside the Bifrost

ODIN
Do you understand what he set in
motion Hes taken us to the brink
of war

FRIGGA
But banishment You would lose him
forever Hes your son

ODIN
What would you have done

FRIGGA
I would not have exiled him to a
world of mortals stripped of his
powers to suffer alone I would
not have had the heart for such
cruelty

ODIN
That is why Im King

(THEN)
I too grieve the loss of our son
But there are some things that even
I cannot undo

You can bring him back
ODIN
No His fate is in his own hands

INT HEALING ROOM - DAY 53 53

Sif Loki and the Warriors three battered and shell-
shocked still reeling from the days events sit before a
ROARING central fire Hogun reaches into the flames pulls
out some fragile HEALING STONES Neither the fire nor the
stones burn him As he carefully places the stones over the
wounds of his comrades the stones begin to glow

He crushes them to a powder His comrades injuries heal up
at the glowing powders touch Fandral winces in pain as
Hogun heals his gaping wound Volstagg looks at the skin on
his arm -- healing but still blackened from the necrotizing
touch of the Frost Giant Loki watches him then stares at
his own arm where the Giants touch turned his skin blue
Its undamaged back to its normal color

VOLSTAGG
We should never have let him go

SIF
There was no stopping him

FANDRAL
At least hes only banished not
dead Which is what wed all be if
that guard hadnt told Odin where
wed gone

VOLSTAGG
How did the guard even know Loki
stares at his arm

LOKI
I told him
FANDRAL
What
LOKI

I told him to go to Odin after wed
left Though he should be flogged
for taking so long

VOLSTAGG
You told the guard

LOKI
I saved our lives And Thors I
had no idea Father would banish him
for what he did

SIF
Loki youre the only one who can
help Thor now You must go to the
Allfather and convince him to
change his mind

LOKI
And if I do then what I love Thor
more dearly than any of you but
you know what he is Hes arrogant
Hes reckless Hes dangerous
(MORE )
LOKI (CONTD)
You saw how he was today Is that
what Asgard needs from its King

The others exchange glances torn Loki has a point
leaves the room Hogun stares after him

SIF
He may speak about the good of
Asgard but hes always been
jealous of Thor

VOLSTAGG
True but we should be grateful to
him He did save our lives

HOGUN
Laufey said there were traitors in
the House of Odin The others turn
to the usually quiet Hogun

FANDRAL
Why is it every time you choose to
speak it has to be something dark
and ominous

HOGUN
A master of magic could easily
bring three Jotuns into Asgard The
others look to Hogun understanding
the implication

VOLSTAGG
No Surely not

FANDRAL
Lokis always been one for
mischief but youre talking about
something else entirely

SIF
Who else could elude Heimdalls
gaze with tricks of light and
shadow

VOLSTAGG
The ceremony was interrupted just
before Thor was named King

SIF
We should go to the Allfather

FANDRAL
And tell him what Oh by the way
we think your son just betrayed the
throne And do us a favor Bring
back Thor Theres a good
fellow 70

SIF
Its our duty If any of our
suspicions are right then all of
Asgard is in danger

INT VAULT - DAY 54 54

Loki heads into the Vault sees the Casket of Ancient
Winters sitting on its stand He walks over to it slowly
reaches out to it lifts it between his forearms off its
pedestal As he does a blueness spreads from his arms
across his body The latticework behind the Casket starts to
separate the Destroyer rousing A fire starts to glow
within its black metal armor as it rattles to life but
Loki ignores it -- the blueness spreading further consuming
his whole body

ODIN (0OS)
Stop

Loki turns sees Odin hurrying into the room the Destroyer
goes motionless the latticework rejoining before it Odin
eyes Loki with dismay

LOKI
Am I cursed

ODIN
No Put the Casket down Loki sets
the Casket back upon its pedestal
his body quickly returning to its
normal form and color He stares at
his father

LOKI
What am I

ODIN
Youre my son

LOKI
What more than that Odin doesnt
answer He looks suddenly weary
burdened Loki sizes him up
realizes the truth

LOKI (CONTD)
The Casket wasnt the only thing
you took from Jotunheim that day
was it

Odin looks him in the eye He can deny it no longer

ODIN
No

(BEAT)
In the aftermath of the battle I
went into the Temple and I found a
baby Small for a giants offspring
-- abandoned suffering left to
die Laufeys son Loki is sent
reeling by the revelation

LOKI
Laufeys son

He desperately struggles to make sense of it all

LOKI (CONTD)
Why You were knee-deep in Jotun
blood Why would you take me

ODIN
You were an innocent child

LOKI
You took me for a purpose what was
it

Odin doesnt answer

LOKI (CONTD)
Tell me

ODIN
I thought we could unite our
kingdoms one day bring about an
alliance bring about a permanent
peace through you But those
plans no longer matter

LOKI
So I am no more than another stolen
relic locked up here until you
might have use of me

ODIN
Why do you twist my words

LOKI
You could have told me what I was
from the beginning Why didnt you

ODIN
You are my son My blood I wanted
only to protect you from the truth

LOKI
Because I am the monster parents
tell their children about at night

ODIN
Dont

LOKI
It all makes sense now Why you
favored Thor all these years

ODIN
Listen

LOKI
Because no matter how much you
claim to love7-t me you could
never have a Frost Giant sitting on
the Throne of Asgard Odins body
begins to shake he lifts his hand
It starts to move out of synch
temporarily leaving a trail the
effect of the Odinsleep
approaching Loki doesnt notice as
Odin tries to fight it off

ODIN
Listen to me

Loki strides away towards the exit

ODIN (CONTD)
Loki

Odin starts towards him when the enormous mental
emotional and physical strain of recent events finally
takes its toll The effect of the Odinsleep consumes him
His entire body now moves out of sync with the rest of the
world leaving trails behind him as he staggers backwards
Odin falls back against a wall his face contorting ina
scream He collapses to the stone floor Loki shocked
hurries to him He takes Odin in his arms calls out

and pulls a thick chain from the back of the truck He
fastens one end around the object then securely affixes the
chain to the bumper and the rear of the undercarriage

space around it warped from the effect of the Odinsleep The
walls of the chamber have moved close around him protecting
him like a dark crypt sealing off any daylight Loki sits
at Odins side across from Frigga She speaks softly to
him

FRIGGA
I asked him to be honest with you
from the beginning There should be
no secrets in a family

LOKI
So why did he lie

FRIGGA
He kept the truth from you so that
you would never feel different You
are in every way our son Loki and
we your family You must know that

Loki takes this in stares at Odin

INT LAUFEYS TEMPLE - DAY 95 95

Darkness shrouds the ruined temple save for the shafts of
light which knife their way in through the damaged ceiling
Loki enters Frost Giant guards surround him on all sides

Laufey approaches towers over him menacingly

LAUFEY
Tell me why I shouldnt kill you

LOKI
Ive come alone and unarmed

LAUFEY
To what end

LOKI
To make you another proposition

LAUFEY
(REALIZING)
So youre the one who let us into
Asgard

LOKI
Youre welcome

LAUFEY
My men are dead and I have no
Casket You are a deceiver Laufey
lashes out grabs Loki around the
throat but Loki calmly stands his
ground

LOKI
You have no idea what I am The
blueness spreads across his face
as Laufey and the guards stare in
shock Loki grins

LOKI (CONTD)
Hello Father

Laufey releases him Lokis body turns back to normal
Intrigued Laufey sizes up his son

LAUFEY
Ah the bastard son I thought Odin
had killed you Thats what I would
have done Hes as weak as you are

LOKI
No longer weak I now rule Asgard
until Odin awakens Perhaps you
should not have so carelessly
abandoned me

This gives Laufey pause

LAUFEY
Or perhaps it was the wisest choice
Ive ever made I will hear you

LOKI
I will conceal you and a handful of
your soldiers lead you into his
chambers and let you slay him
where he lies Ill keep the
throne and you will have the
Casket

Laufey studies Lokis face

LAUFEY
Why would you do this

LOKI
When all is done we will have a
permanent peace between our two
worlds Then I the bastard son
will have accomplished what Odin
and Thor never could

LAUFEY
This is a great day for Jotunheim
Asgard is finally ours

LOKI
No Asgard is mine The rest of the
Nine Realms will be yours if you
do as youre told Laufey considers
the proposition

LAUFEY
I accept

Loki turns to leave As he goes the slightest trace of a
smile crosses his face

INT HEIMDALLS OBSERVATORY - DAY 96 96

Loki emerges out of the Bifrost as Heimdall steps away from
his controls Heimdall glares at Loki Loki notices

LOKI
What troubles you Gatekeeper

HEIMDALL
I turned my gaze upon you in
Jotunheim but could neither see
nor hear you You were shrouded
from me like the Frost Giants who
entered this Realm

LOKI
Perhaps your senses have weakened
after your many years of service

HEIMDALL
Or perhaps someone has found a way
to hide that which he does not wish
me to see

Loki sizes him up smiles

LOKI
You have great power Heimdall
Tell me did Odin ever fear you

HEIMDALL
No

LOKI
And why is that

HEIMDALL
Because he is my King and I am
sworn to obey him

LOKI
Exactly Just as youre sworn to
obey me now Yes A beat

HEIMDALL
Yes

LOKI
Good Then you will open the
Bifrost to no one until I have
undone what my brother has started

buy you one more drink and youll
leave town tonight A long pause
then Thor nods He takes a drink

THOR
I had it all backwards I had it
all wrong

Selvig watches him keenly This is a different Thor than
hes seen before

SELVIG
Its not a bad thing finding out
that you dont have all the
answers Thats when you start
asking the right questions Thor
takes this in

THOR
For the first time in my life I
have no idea what Im supposed to
do

SELVIG
Anyone whos ever going to find
their way in this world has to
start by admitting they dont know
where the hell they are Thor nods

DRUNK TOWNIE (0OS)
Hey I know you man An
intimidating DRUNK TOWNIE nearby
sizes up Thor

DRUNK TOWNIE (0S) (CONTD)
He is one of the Townies from
Isabelas Diner who saw Thor
earlier He approaches belligerent
and looking for a fight

DRUNK TOWNIE (CONTD)
You were in the diner with that hot
girl

Thor doesnt like where this is going

DRUNK TOWNIE (CONTD)
I wouldnt mind her doing a little
research on me

He laughs Thor is annoyed

THOR
I have no quarrel with you But
shes a lady You should be more
respectful

DRUNK TOWNIE
And you should shut the hell up
princess

Selvig looks to Thor concerned that hes going to lose it
But to his surprise Thor remains unaffected by the
Townies baiting

THOR
I will not fight him

DRUNK TOWNIE
Then itll be easy to kick your
ass

Selvig stands steps between the two men

SELVIG
Gentlemen please Lets keep our
heads

Just then Selvig HEAD-BUTTS the Townie knocking him out
Thors impressed Selvig downs his drink then hurls his
glass aside SHATTERING it on the ground

JANE
Why

THOR
Because youre right Its taken so
many generations for your people to
get to this point Youre nearly
there You just need someone to
show you how close you really are

Thor moves beside her opens her notebook turns to the page
which bears a sketch of the Bifrost He takes the pen from
the notebook begins to add to the sketch leading from one
point to another in space

THOR (CONTD)
Look -- your ancestors called it
magic You call it science I come
from a place where theyre one and
the same thing We recognize that
Thor is drawing the branches of
Yggdrasil as she looks on amazed
and intrigued

JANE

THOR
This is how my father explained it
to me

Your world is one of the Nine
Realms of the Cosmos linked to

The blueness creeps from his hands and up his arms as Loki
opens the Casket towards Heimdall who is fast approaching
From inside the Casket all hell breaks loose The fury of
the Casket is unleashed its winds not just howling but
SCREAMING as ice and snow and darkness come flying straight
towards Heimdall Ice clings to his body freezing him but
still he moves forward Loki starts to get worried Heimdall
is nearly upon him The Gatekeeper swings his massive sword
at the prince But the blade STOPS frozen just inches from
Lokis throat Loki breathes a sigh of relief and steps past

Leaps off a nearby rooftop with her
two-headed spear and plunges it
deep into the back of the creature
The creature stands there
motionless the fire dimming in its
faceplate Sif standing atop its
back The Asgardians have a brief
moment of hope But the creature
stirs with life its fire igniting
once again Sif looks on with
growing trepidation Slowly
unnaturally the Destroyer spins
its torso around 180 degrees to
face its attackers The Destroyer
unleashes a blast at Sif She
barely dives off of the behemoth in
time dodging the blast The
Destroyer rises again to its full
height pulling free from Sifs
staff the weapon slipping through
the slats of its armor Sif and the
Warriors Three try to regroup when
the Destroyer unleashes another
blast sending Sif and her comrades
flying in all directions Hoguns

Thor sees his friends lying injured on the ground but has
no time to act as the Destroyer fires in his direction A
storefront near Smith Motor EXPLODES knocking Thor Jane
and Selvig off their feet Thor helps Jane to her feet when
they notice Selvig lying on his back amidst the debris
impaled by a twisted piece of iron

JANE
Erik

She and Thor hurry to his side Hes losing blood going
into shock

SELVIG
(TO JANE)
Go Leave me

Jane takes his hand as Thor spots Hoguns pouch of healing
stones lying in the middle of the street He makes a break
for it dodging through the flaming wreckage then grabs the
pouch and races back He opens the pouch to find the fragile
stones crushed and useless He pours the contents out in his
hand

THOR
Come on give me one Amidst the
useless powder he finally finds
one stone still intact Thor tosses
the pouch aside holds the stone
over the end of the iron rod

JANE
What are you doing What is that
As the stone begins to glow Thor
crushes it Jane looks on amazed
as the glowing powder falls upon
the piece of iron dissolving it
heading downwards until it reaches
Selvigs wound The powder heals
his wound completely

Thor looks down the street sees his wounded friends still
lying there as Selvig sits up in utter astonishment He
reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed
flesh

SELVIG
(to Jane re Thor)
Im really starting to like him
Jane turns to Thor to find hes
gone

THOR

is to survive

She struggles to sit up

SIF
No I will die a warriors death
Stories will be told of this day--
He gently takes her shield from

her

THOR
Live and tell those stories
yourself

At last she nods Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious
with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby Thor makes his way
towards them Volstagg is barely breathing Thor tries to
pull him to safety but its no use He wont budge He
rouses Hogun and Fandral

THOR (CONTD)
(RE VOLSTAGG)
Get him out of here

FANDRAL
No We can still fight
THOR
But not win Move Volstagg or

hell die
Thor looks at them grins

THOR (CONTD)
Dont worry my friends I have a
plan

The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and
drag him away from the battlefield After they go Thor
turns to back to the Destroyer then tosses Sifs shield
aside He strides down the street towards the behemoth
completely defenseless

THOR (CONTD)
Brother for whatever I have done
to wrong you whatever I have done
to lead you to do this I am sorry
But these people have done nothing
to you They are innocents He
continues towards the Destroyer

THOR (CONTD)
Take my life and know I will never
return to Asgard

Thor reaches the Destroyer extends his arms The Destroyer
hesitates sizing up the defenseless Thor then swats him
with its enormous arm We hear the sickening CRACK of
breaking bones as Thor goes flying Thor lands ina
crumpled broken heap in front of Smith Motors before Jane
Selvig and Darcy The wounded Asgardians watch helplessly
from down the street a look of horror on their faces Jane
tries to rush out to Thors aid but Selvig holds her back

back to him to keep it in this Realm but the Bifrost is
too powerful Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor
himself slides towards the Bifrost

brothers wrist but his hand passes through Lokis Just
then the REAL LOKI materializes behind him Thor whirls
around as Loki STABS him in the chest with Gungnir Loki
lifts Thor into the air impaled on the spear and hurls him
across the bridge

Thor bleeding rises to his knees Loki strides up behind
him to finish him off when Thor swing his hammer around It
passes through him Instantly another Loki appears next to
him Thor swings his hammer but that too is an illusion
Loki after Loki appears Thor futilely swinging at each one
never making contact Thor falls back to his knees The
Lokis grin as their raises their spears encircling him

Yet still not clever enough With

Mjolnir then channels outwards
splitting up striking each one of

the Lokis
All of them dissipate into nothingness save one -- the real
Loki -- whos sent flying back across the Bridge Gungnir

knocked from his grasp Thor steps over to his fallen
brother lying dazed on his back Loki winces prepares for
the worst when Thor steps away Loki opens his eyes tries
to stand but cant He looks confused then sees what the

problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop his chest Struggle as he
may Loki cant lift it off Hes pinned to the ground Thor
looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing towards

Jotunheim gaining in strength at the surge of energy
moving through the Bridge Hes at a loss of what to do

right Hes powerless to stop

sacrifice Thor extends his hand
towards Loki summoning Mjolnir
The hammer goes flying to his
grasp Loki looks confused

Thor raises Mjolnir in the air Clouds form above him
thunder RUMBLING Lightning arcs off of his hammer as he
channels the power of the storm into it then -- He strikes
Mjolnir down upon the Rainbow Bridge The blow is massive
causing a rumbling along the whole bridge shaking the
Observatory itself like an earthquake A crack appears where
the blow struck Loki rises to his feet

Stop What are you doing Thor
lifts the hammer again brings it
down harder BOOM The crack grows
bigger The Bifrost energy starts
to stream out from it Loki thinks
fast

never see her again Loki grabs
Gungnir runs towards him ready to
pierce Thor through the back

Forgive me

Summoning every bit of strength he has left Thor raises
Mjolnir one last time drawing lightning to it from all
sides and brings it down with a final terrible blow --

out of it Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the
force of the blast A wave of destruction moves forward
along the Bridge towards the Observatory breaking it apart
as it goes The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART As Loki and
Thor fall together Thor grabs hold of one end of Gungnir
while Loki still clutches the other They both fall towards
the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out from the
broken Bridge Theyre an instant from being blasted by the
destructive force of the energy carried away by the
current pulverized by the debris when --

No

But its too late Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki
