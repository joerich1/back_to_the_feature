made in the otherwise-perfect ragtop

Car-theft tools in a leather case between them theyre prying

crowbar His partner keeps working

Asshole 1 lunges viciously swiping at Carson with the
crowbar taking a piece out of his side Carson starts
BLEEDING profusely but hes too pissed to notice

Carson uses his bat to take the offensive They go at each
other like combatants in a swordfight the CLANKING of metal
echoing through the neighborhood along with the screaming
house and car ALARMS and frantic neighborhood DOGS

Surprised at Carsons fury and strength Asshole 1 backs onto
the lawn oblivious to the running SPRINKLERS

As he backs away his shoe catches on one of the sprinkler
heads It breaks off and a huge GEYSER of water sprays out

Carson holds his bat in both hands and jams the front of it
into Asshole 1s breadbasket He doubles over

Carson grabs Asshole 1s arm and pulls it quickly against
his raised knee There is a SNAP and a loud howl as the arm
breaks and Carson tosses him aside

Seeing this Asshole 2 gives up on the car He takes off
toward the street Carson runs to head him off but hes a lot
faster in his Air Jordans than Carson is in his bare feet

WIDER

Carson grabs the metal lid from a garbage can at the curb and
FLINGS it like a huge Frisbee It sails across the street --

And NAILS Asshole 2s head He kisses the pavement stunned

Carson runs up and grabs him but he pulls out a long sharp
screwdriver and jabs at Carson with it

Then blue flashing lights appear from around the corner A
WESTEC Chevy Blazer Two uniformed GUARDS get out and fumble
with their sidearms

screwdriver Carson glares at the dopey Guards

Javal hits a remote garage door opener Ahead rickety doors
on one of a line of detached garages facing the alley OPEN up

Across from the garage parked parallel against the back of an

same direction as Javal is driving

Javal slams on the brakes stopping just past the garage and
then quickly backs up into the garage

buckles on the edge of the superstructure spring closed

from the ceiling of the garage The rope releases the door

from the opening mechanism so it immediately falls CLOSED

constructed remotes

two OBJECTS sitting atop the TV

The door opens Mrs Han Joy Sam and Lisa walk in rigid
with fear Javal Beretta 9mm in hand comes in behind them
and closes the door Javal strips off his sweat-soaked shirt
and wipes his face with it Mrs Han realizes hes wired to
the moon and it terrifies her

opportunity for a few hours

Still holding the Beretta he grabs a polo shirt from the
closet and pulls it on As the family sits in the chairs

JAVAL

He takes a pair of handcuffs out of his pants pocket He tries
to handcuff Lisa hands behind her back but she resists

You afford me some additional
bargaining power But not much

She wilts Javal cuffs her to the handles of the refrigerator
He puts a strip of duct tape from his tool box across her mouth

He uncovers one of the items atop the TV An electronic box with
three pairs of oversized LED VU meters on the front of it

We NOTICE neat lines of wires running from each of the chairs
up into it Javal flips one of a row of switches on it a
green light and the meters come to life

(continuing)
There No taping your mouths no
restraints Please remain still
while I explain The meters on the
left indicate sound pressure --
Decibels There are microphones on
your chair backs If you raise your
voices above certain level putting
your meter in the red zone for more
than one sustained second the
circuit will be closed

(beat)
The right meters indicate motion
There are pressure sensors inside the
armrests and seats The sensors dont
like to get wet so I hope you were
honest about not needing to use the
loo If you make any excess
movements or try to leave your
chair the circuit will be closed

MRS HAN
I dont understand

She looks at her sound meter which jumped close to the red

MRS HAN
(continuing softly)
What happens if the circuit closes

He uncovers the other item atop the TV -- a one-pound brick of
C-4 high explosive with the detonation mechanism jammed into
it Mrs Han gasps and begins to PANIC

Peeling in reverse onto Highland Javal stomps on the brakes
The snap buckles holding the ice-cream-truck superstructure
around his van BREAK APART and the whole thing slides off
blocking Sabatinis way
Javal drives forward again this time getting onto the 101
North on-ramp

Carson follows Javal onto the freeway Colonel Lee grabs his
AMD-74 machine gun

CARSON
Watch it We need him alive

EXT HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY
Colonel Lee leans out and SHOOTS Javals rear tires out

The van drives erratically held in its lane by bumping
against the cars around it

Carson pulls up closer

Suddenly the rear doors of the van burst open

And Javal flies out riding a motorcycle Hes got the money
stuffed into two big chaps-sized SADDLEBAGS slung over the

back of the machine

He straddles the lanes going against traffic riding like a
maniac back the way he came

Carson watches him in the rear-view and speeds up driving
away from him

COLONEL LEE
Turn around
But Carson hugs the shoulder moving through the heavy
traffic until he spots what he was looking for

The Biker Club riding in formation up ahead

Carson cuts in front of them and slams on the brakes He jumps
out and grabs one of the Bikers machines by the handlebars
wrestling it to a stop While pulling its BURLY OWNER off it

CARSON
FBI Call our office theyll take
care of you

Meanwhile the other BIKERS have come to help their friend
They pull guns knives chains

Theyre stopped by Sabatini who appears holding her MP-5
machine pistol The Biker yells at Carson as he drives way

BIKER
Im a taxpayer Im a goddamn
dentist

COLONEL LEE

gets in the drivers seat of the Mercedes and turns it around
JAVAL

continues down the freeway on his bike straddling lanes
driving the wrong way retracing his route back to Highland

leaving CAR HORNS CURSING and COLLISIONS in his wake

WIDER

When everyone thinks theyve seen it all here comes another
mad biker -- Carson -- riding against traffic in pursuit

EXT HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

Javal rides against traffic down the Cahuenga on-ramp then
jumps the divider runs the light crossing Highland and gets
into the southbound lanes

He just misses a BUS nearly wiping out
CARSON

Just dont kill yourself you piece

Carson fishes out his two-way

MIRANDA
(into radio)
Love to be in the loop on this

EXT HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY
Speeding up Carson precariously cuts in between traffic

CARSON
(to himself)
Not just now dear

Seeing Carson approaching on his right Javal pulls his Benelli
shotgun from one of the saddlebags He rests the barrel on his
arm and FIRES a blinding-white load of magnesium at Carson

Carson grabs the brake handles to slow down and the BLAST
crosses just in front of him A few BURNING pieces pepper the
front fender of the bike but the bulk HITS the concrete art-
deco statue in the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl The statue
shatters into a million FLAMING fragments

CARSON
(continuing grumbling)
I coulda had a ranch maybe some
horses but no we moved to LA

JAVAL

speeds up A car passing on the right BUMPS him Javal grabs
for the handlebar to stabilize himself DROPPING the shotgun

A HELICOPTER appears and flies just above him

Then spotting some police cars ahead he quickly hangs a
right ducking onto Alta Loma Terrace

EXT ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY

Carson stops at the entrance to the winding hillside
neighborhood accessible only by footpaths The area is
covered by thick foliage hiding Javal from the helicopter

Carson revs down so he can listen for Javals machine He
HEARS it up above and takes off up a steep flight of stairs

NEW ANGLE

Javal has reached the summit only to find hes boxed in He
can either turn around or take the neighborhoods unique
outdoor elevator housed in a free-standing three-story
concrete tower

He jumps off his bike Carrying the saddlebags he runs into
the elevator -- but it needs a key to operate

Javal comes back out panicking He HEARS Carson coming up
the hill He spots a GARDENER watering nearby with a hose

ANGLE WITH CARSON

as he reaches the summit He sees Javals motorcycle
abandoned lying on its side

And then he sees the Gardener sprawled on the ground a
BULLET HOLE in the center of his forehead

Carson turns off his motorcycle and pulls out his Sig 9mm He
moves slowly toward the elevator tower and looks inside

HIS POV

The casement window in the back of the tower is broken One end
of the gardeners hose is tied to a grate and the hose is
hanging through the broken window

Carson looks out the window as Javal climbs down the outside of
the tower on the hose to High Tower Drive the street below

CARSON
(into radio)
Hes on foot at the base of the

elevator tower

But just as Carson is about to climb down the hose

EXT HIGH TOWER DRIVE - DAY

Javal spots a COLLEGE GIRL backing a tiny Geo out of her
garage He rips her out of the car jumps in and tears away
EXT ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY
Carson jumps back on his motorcycle and starts it up
CARSON
(into radio)
Goddammit Hes in a blue Geo

EXT HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY

In the Geo Javal drives out onto Highland He muscles his way
through traffic then cuts across to Franklin

Behind him Robbins and Walther drive along the divider lane
On the bike Carson emerges from Alta Loma joining Sabatini
and Dave in Daves Dodge and Colonel Lee in the Mercedes as

they all try to catch up to Javal

The helicopter flies ahead then disappears past the hill
below Franklin

EXT VINE STREET - DAY

Javal hangs a hard right off of Franklin onto Vine putting
him on top of a hill that drops down to Sunset

Carson and Colonel Lee close in on the Geo

Suddenly the helicopter RISES UP from the bottom of the hill
Its less than fifty feet in front of Javal at eye level

Javal FIRES at the copter with his Beretta

Colonel Lee indiscriminately FIRES his machine gun at the Geo
Carson SHOUTS at Colonel Lee furious at his carelessness
INT PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Colonel Lees BULLETS trace across the cockpit of the
helicopter one hits the PILOT in the neck Clutching it with
one hand the Pilot loses control of the copter

EXT VINE STREET - DAY

Everyone on the road scatters to get out of the copters way
It appears as though its going to crash onto the street then

it gains altitude GYRATING wildly just above the Geo

Javal tries to move away but one of its landing runners
SMASHES through the top of the windshield WEDGING itself
against the inside of the Geos roof

Snared the little Geo is LIFTED off the ground -- instantly
too high for a terrified Javal to escape from it

INT PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The wounded Pilot barely conscious searches for safe area to
set down -- but there are cars and people everywhere

The Pilot wrestles his stick his copter is almost impossible
to control with the car hanging from it Hes fading

EXT VINE STREET - DAY

The copter and Geo lurch over and past the round Capitol
Records building KNOCKING the spindle off the top of it

The impact further destabilizes the copters flight Its
heading right toward the 20-story Sunset Vine Tower at the
bottom of the hill

INT JAVALS GEO - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Javal trapped inside looks through the windshield as the
glass and steel side of the tower looms closer He SCREAMS

EXT SUNSET VINE TOWER - DAY

The copter and the Geo CRASH into the side of the Tower 12
floors up Glass blows out in all directions the rotor
shatters office furnishings are blown through the hole like
backwash

The Geo hangs passengers side down from the runner
CLOSER

From the series of jerking slipping MOVEMENTS it is clear
the copter is not going to stay where it is for long

The Geos passenger side door pops open Javal panting with
fear jimmies his foot against the dashboard and holds the
steering wheel to keep from falling out

ANGLE ON VEHICLES BELOW

In the clog of traffic cars swerve away rapidly reverse
anything to get away from the area below the impact
JAVAL

reacts to another SLIP The big saddlebags of money on the
seat start to slide toward the open door

He gingerly reaches over to grab them the copter SHIFTS
again he loses his grip

And clutching the saddlebags he TOPPLES out of the car

We stay with him as he FALLS 12 stories SCREAMING

Then LANDING on top of a parking meter It RIPS though his
chest and he hits the sidewalk with a wet THUD

EXT VINE AND SUNSET - DAY

Carson rushes across the street to Javals body The teetering
copter and Geo are right above it

Grimacing Carson tries to lift Javals body up off the
parking meter but its messy slippery wor

Unable to move the body Carson quickly searches its pockets
All he finds is the now-empty prescription bottle

Above the copter GROANS its about to come loose

Carson pulls out his Sig 9mm and FIRES several times at
Javals right wrist then TEARS the HAND off the body

With a loud WRENCHING of metal the copter and Geo break away
from the building

Carson grabs the saddlebags and runs like hell across the
street diving for cover behind a car

BEHIND CARSON
the copter and Geo crash to the sidewalk and EXPLODE

He throws Walther the saddlebags and Sabatini the severed hand

on La Cienega at 842 He called the

to get to his location move and
secure the hostages and activate
his time bomb

CARSON
He probably waited a while to pad
the time -- he wanted us know the

family was still alive

(sotto re Koreans)
So these crazy bastards wouldnt
throw a premature shit hemorrhage
but he didnt want to call too soon
either I say theyre within 15 to
20 minutes via surface streets of

Hussein remember the Scuds he lobbed

INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
Best guess is an AS-15 medium-range
cruise -- their version of our
Tomahawk launched from offshore
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
The AS-15 is gyro-guided It will
find the city but its not too
accurate beyond that

VICE PRESIDENT
Still for their purposes its
perfect Hit somewhere in LA take
out a city block or two

SECRETARY OF STATE
To the eyes of the world its a
measured response -- like what Reagan
did to Qaddafi But actually striking
at an American city would be a huge
psychological victory for them

able to destroy a missile in flight
right up to the moment before it
achieves its target

And if the family turns up okay
theyll just make it self-destruct

VICE PRESIDENT

Were forgetting one thing here the
family Intelligence is sure the
North will abort their attack if Mrs
Han and her kids are safely returned

Absolutely Their whole game depends
on claiming a legitimate provocation

Still we should let them know thered
be a response if it comes to it

INT BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
The SOUND is getting louder and louder

JOY
Oh my God

The meters are hovering just below the red

SAM

pivots his head and looks at the tiny microphone no bigger
than a pencil eraser attached neatly to the headrest

He begins chewing his wad of GUM leans in toward the
microphone his head obscuring what hes doing

He moves back and we see hes SEALED the front of the mic with
a small piece of the gum

And his meter drops to zero

WIDER

Sam tilts his head forward and bends his wrist upward so he
can get the rest of the gum out of his mouth Then while
keeping pressure on the armrest with his elbow he moves his
hand over to Mrs Han They cant quite reach each other

He FLICKS the piece of gum and she catches it

Meanwhile the NOISE increases The two meters peak into the
red the yellow WARNING LIGHT begins to flash
Mrs Han quickly puts the gum in her mouth bites it in half
and cautiously passes the remainder over to Joy

Joy puts the gum in her mouth She tries to push it over her
mic but her hair is in the way She shakes her head some
hair strands remain but she covers the mic just as the
Gardeners noise reaches a CRESCENDO

All three sound meters sit pinned to zero The yellow light
stops flashing

Sam sweating looks at his mother and sister and starts
laughing They join him a celebration for a small victory

So what the hell does Kipchak mean

INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
Uh its a code name for weapons
using the Yersinia Pestis bacillus

He really doesnt want to be the one telling the President
about this

INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
(continuing)

Kipchaks were Asian nomads In 1347
they attacked a Genoese fort and
catapulted infected corpses over the
walls The Genoese who survived
carried the disease back to Europe
and it killed half the population

CIA CHIEF
Seems the missile is armed with a
warhead carrying the Pneumonic
Plague
The President goes nuts

The Black Plague Every time I talk
to you fuckin guys it gets worse
What happened to this limited
retaliation shit

SECRETARY OF STATE

The North Koreans insist the missile
carries a conventional payload They
say were trying to trick them into
aborting the attack

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Especially since the uplink from our
Op in PyUngyang was unencrypted

CIA CHIEF
We think one of the Hard-liners
switched the warhead without the
Premiers knowledge But hes not
about to take our word for it and
hes too weak to risk the
humiliation of backing down

PRESIDENT
(incredulous thru video
link)
They use a biological weapon on
American soil they have to know
well respond

SECRETARY OF STATE
Maybe they dont think we got the
guts Maybe they want a war cause
they think they can whip us like
what happened in Nam Look who
were dealing with a teetering
outlaw regime and inside it some
wild-ass renegades working their
screwy agenda

Irwin put em in protective suits
but its 40 minutes before theyre on

What1ll happen

There are treatments -- streptomycin
and tetracyclines -- but wed be

overwhelmed by the numbers and its
extreme contagiousness

CIA CHIEF
We could have 500000 infected ina
week who knows how many after that

Long beat as everyone tries to contemplate the unthinkable

PRESIDENT

Im gonna toast those fuckers Have
