cryptographic and mathematical figures from an overhead
projector He exudes confidence in his subject matter

a far more elegant approach

Sh This isnt just about large number
theory its about cryptography

acquire the solution in a dramatically
more efficient manner

LIZ
Are you seeing anybody

JANEK
So far no one has been able to
accomplish such constructions
yet

LATER - INT RECEPTION HALL - DAY

Janek is now discussing his ideas with attendees over a buffet
table with all the confidence and showmanship of his lecture

shortcut

test probe and Whistlers Braille Terminal gives him a rapid
readout
WHISTLER

The scrabble letters start resolving into TOO

WHISTLER
Mmm hmm Give me another one

Whistlers Braille Terminal rattles away

WHISTLER

WHISTLER

Try another quadrant

Something comes up on the monitor

WHISTLER

chip

passenger jets

unconscious with a single blow Fade to black

INT AUTO TRUNK
(Trivia nuts the cars license plate is California 2EAK042)

Bishop regains consciousness in the trunk of a car A
recurring noise is heard He strikes a match so he can see
He squirms around to no avail He hears other noises and
just lies there Finally the car stops and someone gets
out The trunk opens and Buddy Wallace is shining a
flashlight in Bishops face

BISHOP
Oh shit

WALLACE
What are you doing up

Wallace knocks him out again

INT COSMOS OFFICE

Bishop regains consciousness in an ultra-modern well-
appointed office suite With an aquarium full of exotic
fish and a Cray supercomputer Cosmo is waiting in the

shadows

COSMO
Pain

BISHOP
Yeah

Cosmo steps out of the shadows so that his features can be
discerned

COSMO
Try aspirin

Cosmo offers him a small jar of pills

He hides the jar in one of his hands in the same magicians
style that he hid that coin all those years ago

BISHOP
Cosmo

Cosmo reveals the jar
COSMO

Im sorry if he hurt you Im afraid
Wallace doesnt like you very much

BISHOP
Yeah You ought to have that guy
checked for rabies

COSMO
Rabies occurs only in warm-blooded
animals Anyway I couldnt have
you talking to the Russians Five
years ago yes we could trust them
not to go running to the FBI or if
they did we could trust the FBI not
to believe them today we cant
trust anybody

BISHOP
What the hells going on here Cosmo
what what happened

COSMO

The world changed on us Marty And
without our help

BISHOP
What happened

Cosmo smiles and motions to get up Both do

COSMO
There I was in prison and one day
I help a couple of nice older
gentlemen make some free telephone
calls They turn out to be let us
say good family men

BISHOP
Organized crime

COSMO
Heh Dont kid yourself Its not
that organized Anyway they arranged
for me to get an early release from
my “unfortunate incarceration and I
began to perform a variety of
services

Cosmo turns on a large monitor

COSMO
(continuing)
For starters I re-organized their
entire financial operation Budgets
payroll money laundering you name
it

Cosmo demonstrates with a computer spreadsheet

COSMO
(continuing)
And the whole network is protected
by a very powerful encryption system
so the government cannot read it

BISHOP
But if the feds get Janeks box

Cosmo switches off the screen

COSMO
Disaster Therefore we must have
it
BISHOP
To protect the organization
COSMO
(hesitantly)
Yes
BISHOP

No I dont buy it I know you
Cosmo grins

COSMO
God its good to see you

Cosmo silently puts his finger to his mouth Shhh and
looks to the cieling He motions Bishop toward the Cray
supercomputers air-conditioned glass compartment

As they walk over to the Cray Cosmo starts whispering

COSMO
Remember how to change the world
Marty Remember Did you ever get
around to actually doing it No I
guess not Well I think I can

They enter the Cray compartment

BISHOP
Really
COSMO
Yes
Cosmo continues aloud
COSMO

Whats wrong with this country Marty
Bishop just looks dumb

padded seat

Cosmo smiles broadly

back

COSMO
Money You taught me that Evil
defense contractors had it noble
causes did not Politicians are
bought and sold like so much chattel
Our problems multiply Pollution
crime drugs poverty disease
hunger despair we throw gobs of
money at them The problems always
get worse Why is that Because
moneys most powerful ability is to
allow bad people to continue doing
bad things at the expense of those
who dont have it

BISHOP
I agree Now who did you say you
were working for

COSMO
Oh thats just my day job Listen
when I was in prison I learned that
everything in this world including
money operates not on reality

BISHOP
-but the perception of reality

COSMO
Posit People think a bank might be
financially shaky

BISHOP

Consequence People start to withdraw

their money

COSMO

Result Pretty soon it IS financially

shaky

BISHOP
Conclusion You can make banks fail

COSMO
Bzzzt Ive already done that
Maybe youve read about a few

Bishop puts on a no shit look

Both men sit down on the Crays

sensing the old college banter coming

COSMO
Think bigger

BISHOP

Yes

BISHOP
Currency market

COSMO
Yes

BISHOP
Commodities market

COSMO
Yes

BISHOP

Small countries
Cosmo nods

COSMO
I might even be able to crash the
whole damned system Destroy all
records of ownership Think of it
Marty No more rich people no more
poor people everbodys the same
isnt that what we said we always
wanted

BISHOP
Cos you havent gone crazy on me
have you

COSMO
Who else is going to change the world
Marty Greenpeace

Bishop laughs

BISHOP
You ARE crazy

A disappointed Cosmo briskly leaves the compartment

COSMO
Tomorrow they will retrieve your
fingerprints from the gun that killed
the Russian consular officer
COSMO

The following day those prints will
be run through an FBI computer

Cosmo taps on a keyboard

COSMO

They will come up with a name

Cosmo starts entering Bishops real name Martin Brice into

an FBI computer record

COSMO

Martin Brice My old and good friend
who promised me we would not get in
trouble and who I might add did

not And then they will check this
database in Washington DC which

Im now able to access

you

thanks to

Now a screenful of random junk resolves into a login screen

COSMO
(continuing)

Of course no one knows where Martin
Brice is today But what if this

indicated an alias

Cosmo types Martin Bishop into a Known Aliases field

overtyping None

Bishop is shaken

BISHOP
Dont dont do it Cos
COSMO

Bishop nods
COSMO

Cosmo hits Enter and then Information

you guys That the NSA is here

this kind of thing

CREASE
Absolutely This is outside the
NSAs jurisdiction

WHISTLER
Unless the NSA didnt want anybody
to know about Janeks little black
box

BISHOP

I keep thinking about something Greg
told me He said that our codes
were based on an entirely different
system than the Russian codes So
this box really wouldnt work on
them The only thing it would really
be good for is spying on Americans

MOTHER
Oh sure with a box like that they
could read the FBIs mail

WHISTLER
Or the CIAs Or the White Houses

CREASE
No wonder they dont want to share
with the other children

ABBOTT
What do you want Mr Bishop
