The old bellhop takes a hit off his cigar and stares
his cap lost in thought

TED
What do you mean

The old guy passes the cap over to Ted

THE OLD GUY
Put it on

Ted puts the cap on

EXT THE MON SIGNOR HOTEL--DUSK
Ted the bellboy meets his first guest of the evening
taxi unloads her luggage To his warm surprise the
a Beautiful Mediterranean Goddess (actually we will
see she is not technically a goddess but a High
She is about 25 years old speaks with an Italian
is dressed in Gypsy garb She is Athena
Ted takes Athenas luggage onto his cart But one item
woven Moroccan bag proves to be unbearably heavy
concerned as he attempts to lift it
ATHENA

Pleeze be careful -- my God You

have no idea
Ted strains as he uses all his cojones to lift the
heavy bag onto the cart Athena tips the cab driver

The driver winces and gets in the cab Ted has now
with grunts and groans and strained blood vessels to

put
this thing on the cart The cab skids away Athena
looks at
Ted who is out of breath
ATHENA
Im usually a good tipper but this
one -- this cab driver -- he had
green all around him I dont like
that in aman
Ted wheezes and pounds on his chest
TED
Green Is that bad Like you read
auras or something like that
ATHENA
Something like that
TED
Yeah well what color are you seein
around me hows the tip lookin
ATHENA
I see purple in your face and
As if she cant help herself Athenas eyes are
strangely

drawn to his crotch

She frowns confused by this impulse Ted appears to be
charmingly oblivious

Athena looks back into his face

ATHENA
youre okay

Ted touches his face -- as if searching for the
purple in

it -- and moves the cart inside discreetly checking
out his

crotch and giving her a confused side glance

her Gold Card and smiles

EXT ELEVATOR--DUSK

The doors open and Ted and Athena emerge upon the third
Ted follows Athena with the cart down the hallway to
room

AT THE HONEYMOON SUITE DOOR

Ted opens the door then lifts the easiest bags first
the center of the room is a Jacuzzi with hokey plastic
poised with urns on each side A dormant fireplace
beyond the still hot tub

Ted stares at the heavy bag with anxiety -- then looks
front of him to Athena as she rubs the round plastic

a little Cupid and mumbles Perfect

Then arms open wide chin lifted to heaven eyes

she mumbles a faint incantation Then she does a belly-
wiggle and turns to Ted who is truly perplexed

She relieves him of the task and effortlessly picks up
bag
ATHENA

The White Cliffs of Dover
Ted is stunned as she slings the bag over her shoulder
pauses to pull a 10 spot out of her cleavage She hands
to him Ted is grateful and disoriented
ATHENA
The others will be coming soon Send
them pleeze
Ted nods confused by the others and walks off with
cart Then he turns from outside the doorway
TED
Oh -- I forgot to show you how to
turn on the Jacuzzi

But Athena is ahead of him -- she flips a switch and

begins to flow from the baby cupids urns into the hot

ATHENA

IN THE SUITE BEDROOM
A round bed with pink tucknroll headboard Its
to imagine having an orgasm in this room -- unless it
achieved by laughing
Athena carefully removes a large beautiful white slab
stone from her tapestry bag She caresses it and
like a baby to the bed and places it in the very
head of the rock resting on dusty heart-shaped pillows
Then she removes from her bag a pink negligee and
high-heeled slippers
And these she places with reverence on the bed
ATHENA

On this night oh great goddess Diana

we restore your virgin flesh and

bring you back to real life
CLOSE ON the rock slab We hold the artifact

ATHENA

several
packs of smokes drop into the juvenile delinquents
hands
KIVA

ELSPETH
(to Ted)
We have a reservation in the Honeymoon

TED
Oh yeah you must be one of the

She stares at him without humor He fumbles for the
key He
walks around the desk to help her with her black
crocodile
luggage Jars clang inside He is ready to go but
Elspeth
turns to lecture Kiva on the hazards of smoking as
Kiva

lights up

ELSPETH

Hello -- welcome to this weeks

As Kiva goes off on her impression of a game-show host
Elspeth is growing increasingly rageful like a mother

ELSPETH
Kiva Thats enough --

She cuts Kivas ramble off Kiva blows smoke defiantly

KIVA
Youre not my mother

ELSPETH
Yes I am

KIVA
Then whyre we sleeping together

Ted looks on uneasily at the relationship that is
to unfold here
Elspeth checks his reaction and becomes self-conscious

who cares about you --

laugh He leads the way to the elevator
AT THE HONEYMOON SUITE DOOR
The couch has been set out here in the hall as well as
tables lamps and the TV Elspeth and Kiva enter the
Athena is gone As Ted stumbles around the furniture in
hall he peers in the room and see a transformation
most of the furniture removed candles and incense and
are beginning to form an altar around the fireplace
But oddest of all is the pink-tinged water swirling in
Jacuzzi and pouring from the cupid urns A sprinkle of
powder on the carpet encircles the hot tub Elspeth
him a tip as he gawks at the circle
ELSPETH

Flea powder One of the others is

bringing her cat
Ted starts away again perplexed He turns for one last
to see Elspeth kneeling before Kiva who sprawls on the

into the hall and comes back in lugging the TV into

Elspeth kneels before the altar Athena enters the room
the cleansed artifact and lays the slab in the center
the altar upon the heart-shaped pillows as Elspeth lays
sword next to the rock The women look upon the union
tender affection
ATHENA
Soon -- our goddess will come I
will go get her negligee
Athena stands up but her reverie is dispelled as she
Loud TV suddenly blasts from the bedroom and Kiva the
is trying on the pink negligee over her clothes Athena

ATHENA

What are you doing Have you no

ELSPETH
Kiva My friend Kiva turn off the

ATHENA
Well Elspeth your friend cannot

The women have a stare-down Then Athena calls out --

ATHENA

Elspeth becomes anxious with jealousy Athena is

exasperated
as she firmly demands from Elspeth --
ATHENA
Lets not forget -- I am the High

Elspeth defers to Athena with remembered reverence and
respect She bows apologetic and scurries to the
bedroom

exotic cloths and fixings Elspeth and Athena are hard
work on a strange nature sculpture as Jezebel enters
stands inside the powdered circle and before the hot
which now has dark blue water swirling inside She
her cat -- upward toward heaven -- frees the cat bares
breasts and sucks in the vibes Ahhhh
Ted settles the bags down hoping for a peek at her
but her back is to him The kitty rubs on her leg She
it up and presses it against her bare breasts petting
sweetly She winks and hands him a tip

JEZEBEL
Toodle-loo

And saying this she shoos him away Through the glass
to the bedroom she sees Kiva sprawled on the bed

on herself

JEZEBEL
Well -- I see Elspeth has herself a

Elspeth seethes at her Jezebel acts blithely innocent
IN THE HALLWAY
Ted is walking from the room with the cart His face is
in a mask of perpetual frown as he looks at the tip in
hand -- at least these lunachicks tip well
Waking him out of his deep mood is Raven Another
intoxication she wears a short skirt all done up in
American Southwestern themes No shoes

But she carries a small old handmade broom She moves

the hall blissed-out Ted makes eye contact despite

RAVEN
Im looking for the room for making
love

TED

You might be referring to the
Honeymoon Suite Straight thata way
you cant miss it -- see all that
furniture in the hallway --

Ohhh I know it all seems very

strange but youre coping with us

Ted looks down at the broom at her side her bare

thick dark hair It keeps getting weirder She wanders

INT FRONT DESK--NIGHT

The last of the lovely girls arrives She is different
the others She looks like a farm girl very Earth
with a tablecloth halter top and skirt sandals anda

scarf over her long dark curls She carries two bags by
herself and holds a small black pot under her arm She

Eva

TED
(already weary of
these girls)
Yeah yeah Honeymoon Suite

There

her

glowing
other-

as Eva

EVA
Oh yes Im late

She lowers her eyes worried

TED

All right -- lemme give ya a hand
EVA

Oh no thats all right I can

carry them by myself
She is so sweet and sincere that he feels like a heel
have been irritated with her He picks up her bags

TED
Im a man doin a job -- no hero

Eva smiles beautifully

EVA
Well gosh -- thank you

IN THE ELEVATOR
Ted holds Evas hippy sacks as she holds her black pot
is a shy quiet tension here
EVA
Tell me how long have the others

been here

TED
About an hour

Evas heart sinks They arrive at the door He carries
bags in

IN THE SUITE

The room is entirely transformed into a beautiful
palace with an elaborate altar both earthly and the
earthly The other four girls are arranging the altar

enters
ATHENA
You are very late Eva

EVA
Im sorry Athena I was attending a
birth and the placenta was late in
coming

Ted is slightly queasy She hands him a tip and smiles

then
takes it back
EVA
Oh wait lemme give you a little
more than that
Teds no fool he waits while Eva looks through her
change

purse

ELSPETH
Which birth is more important to
you that of a mortal or that of a
goddess

EVA
All life is precious but I do
apologize for being late Elspeth

JEZEBEL
Back home they jist yank on the
umbilical cord do a Karate chop on
the mamas belly and them things
come right out

EVA
They do that here too Jezebel in
the hospitals but it causes
hemorrhages I fed the mother a bowl
of comfrey tea and it brought the
afterbirth down perfectly The couple
are going to use it for fertilizer
to plant a lovely tree for their
baby

KIVA
Oh wow -- if they were really back-
to-nature theyd eat it like other
mammals do

CLOSE ON Teds face as he gets thoroughly grossed out
RAVEN
In some Native American cultures
they dry the umbilical cord grind
it to a fine powder and put it ina
leather pouch that the baby wears to
ward off evil But burying the
placenta is also a very sound
ecological practice -- cause of the
oxygen it carries

EVA
(cheerfully to the
others)
Yes -- because you see when the
placenta detaches from the uterine
wall
TED
(wincing in disgust)
Uh thank you ladies -- Ill be

going now If you need anything --
Eva places a nice tip in his palm

ATHENA
Wait We do need a few things

Ted sighs as Eva enters the circle with her black pot

She

kneels softly holds her hands in piety before the
altar

and softly incants as she offers her pot and places it
on

the altar The stone and sword and flowers now rest
here on

pillows covered in chiffon scarves The negligee hangs
from

the mantel the slippers underneath as if expecting
someone

to materialize into the garments

ATHENA
We need fresh rosemary from the
kitchen Mostly what we need is from
the kitchen Hey are you listening

Ted is watching Eva enchanted

TED
Yeah yeah rosemary

ATHENA

ELSPETH

a trout fish and a piece of raw
meat liver if you have it
KIVA
(whining)
I want fries -- you dumb jerks with
your stupid fucking ritual

ATHENA
Shut up you little shit

ELSPETH
Dont talk to her that way

Ted has scribbled down the items as she speaks He
this list and these girls and shudders as he walks
turns points at Eva

Ted smiles at this angel of a girl She smiles back

she looks him in the eyes he feels a strange buzzing
connection happening He holds his head almost

with dizziness Athena smirks

ATHENA
Get to work man

Ted comes out of his daze looks at the list again and
off After he goes the girls begin to bring forth
most treasured offerings in ornate ancient bottles

vials
Jezebel folds her arms and clears her throat in the
direction

of Kiva sitting idly on the edge of the blue water
Jacuzzi

with her feet dipping irreverently in the water

ELSPETH
Kiva

KIVA

ELSPETH
You have to go in the next room now

KIVA
Oh wow like Im bummed out that I

She climbs up the stairs trying to pull the brat to
her
feet

KIVA
Dont put me in there by myself

ELSPETH
Kiva dont do this to me

Kiva sees a bit of weakening here she takes her feet
out of

with the egg whites and the kilt
Elspeth is now fully seduced Kiva takes Elspeths hand
presses it lightly on her face

ELSPETH
You mean like last week

Kiva nods Elspeth is enthralled but from a disgusted
sound from Jezebel Elspeth realizes shes revealing
side of her life -- in front of her coven She

looks around and see all the coven looking at her a
Jezebel an understanding Raven a preoccupied Eva and
impatient and stern Athena

Elspeth comes to her senses straightens her posture

ELSPETH
Well talk about this later Kiva

KIVA

(angrily)
No

She turns on Elspeth and bites her hand Elspeth pulls
arm away and grabs Kiva by the hair

JEZEBEL
Aw really now -- child abuse

ELSPETH

ATHENA

Elspeth lets go of Kivas hair Kiva jerks away from

Now that the fucking melodrama is
over can we start the goddamn ritual --

pleeze

Elspeth enters the powered circle

Each girl takes off

shoes They anoint themselves with oils

ATHENA

We are communing here on New Years
Eve to bring to life the great goddess
Diana who was turned to stone in

this very room forty years ago today

The girls moan in sleepy eerie agreement as they begin

sway within the circle

ATHENA

Diana great beautiful one we make

these offerings to you

that we may

undo the wicked spell which deprived

you of the seed of your
virginal blood of your

lover your
very life

We now form the symbolic rock with

our bodies

And saying this the girls all form a rock with their

gracefully draped one upon the other Music begins and

they start to unfold from the rock

The girls each find their place in a semicircle around

Jacuzzi Some bare their breasts

other strip off a

clothes They anoint their arms with water from the

They begin a lovely dance snaking their way around the

ATHENA
On this night in this hour we Call
upon the Ancient Power O Goddess
bride I offer thee Milk froma
mothers sweet titty

Each of the girls moans eerily Athena places the
the altar and bows away She joins the circle as
steps forward with her offering in a vial

ELSPETH
To reverse the evil which has been
done I make this offering to the
Divine One A whore not an innocent
was For whom I seized a virgins
blood

JEZEBEL
Goddess of Light Goddess of Lust
To undo this awful spell is a real
must To bring you life and get you
high I offer the sweat of five mens
thighs

The girls moan loudly as they sway Jezebel places her
offering in the hot tub and bows out returning to the

Now Raven comes forth with a small leather canteen She
unscrews the lid as she offers in her opiate stupor

RAVEN

Diana oh great one we live without

sun Until this wicked curse is undone

In hope that you live and to us

appear I have collected a years

worth of tears
She pours liquid into the mix as the witches moan Now
Evas turn Eva continues to sway not moving forth to
altar The girls keep their eyes closed as they sway

for Evas offering Athena finally gives her a push and

goes
Eva kneels before the altar She produces a silver

bottle
with a chain on its cap and neck She timidly begins to
incant
EVA
Great Goddess Diana fail you I will
I was to bring fresh sperm from my
Bill I had him erect and his semen
would follow But alas I was hot so
hot that I swallowed
The moans turn to wails as the girls GASP and SHRIEK
Athena
opens her eyes wildly
ATHENA
You stupid little witch You swallowed
the sperm Aye-yi--yi
Elspeth opens her eyes and folds her arms smirking
bitterly

ELSPETH
It just shows what an amazing lack
of control you have over yourself
Eva

JEZEBEL
Honey why didnt you just use your
hands Didnt your mama teach you
not to put them things in your mouth

RAVEN
I understand though

Eva bursts into tears Athena is firm

ATHENA
There is no time to cry over swallowed
sperms Youre gonna have to get

Amazingly Teds attention is captivated by Evas
not by the naked charms of the other witches She shyly
her breasts Sensitive to her shame and sorrow he
away and steps from the door to fetch the room-service
Athena directs the others to put on their shirts Ted
in the cart

Okay mister heres your fifty-dollar

The girls step out Athena turns to Eva and points to
watch then holds up one finger Eva looks up worried

door closes on her and Ted She looks at Ted and sighs

covers her with a shawl
IN THE HALLWAY
The other witches listen at the door

ELSPETH
If she doesnt get his goop in ten
minutes Im going to take him myself

JEZEBEL

forty years trying to perfect a ritual
to undo a wicked curse put on our
goddess Diana

Gee

Oh

TED

EVA

before us tried and failed But
Athena our High Priestess discovered
a great potion to reverse the evil
spell which turned our beautiful
goddess into an old rock

TED

(looking at the rock)

Yeah Is is that her

Eva nods looking lovingly at the stone

EVA

She was a beautiful virgin An
entertainer by trade but a great
sorceress by design It was here in
this very room on her wedding night
a jealous rival placed the curse on

Diana
TED
She turned to -- that -- here
EVA
Yes and her young husband turned

into a pink fish They found him
swimming in the pool in circles
While our dear goddess a stone in

She pulls the girl (in the black satin mask) up off her
and makes the girl stand The women face each other and
into a cheek-to-cheek tango

CLOSE ON Ted as he shakes his head Are his eyes

I hate to tell you this but I kinda
doubt she was a virgin

EVA
Oh but she was She had lovers but
she saved that for marriage Which
is the example Ive tried to follow
to do everything but that till I
marry

She begins to sob again Ted comforts her

TED
Hey dont cry a virgin is a rare
and beautiful thing If you say she
was a virgin Ill believe it

EVA
Well it doesnt matter now and
she wont be resurrected tonight
cause I failed her I let my whole
coven down

TED
Wait a sec -- that rock was gonna
turn back into this

He holds up the photo Eva nods
TED

Now that would be something worth
seeing
EVA
Only not now -- we were each supposed
to bring something -- a life fluid
TED
(wincing in disgust)
If this is gonna be like one of those

afterbirth conversations I dont

doing a

ritualistic shuffle

(trying to dodge her
hexing eyes)
Well thats a good thing A guy

EVA
(pointing to the
Jacuzzi)
We did it right there in the big
cauldron

JEZEBEL

of problems -- without penetration

ELSPETH

ATHENA
Okay girls enough Sex Education

Athena regally leads the ritual as they all bare their

breasts
again Kiva throws off her shirt to join in As she
does we
see black bondage tape on her nipples Elspeth darts a
quick
look at the tape looks at the other witches -- not
sure she
likes this -- but she goes with it The witches sway in
a
circle eyes closed as Eva makes her offering
EVA
Goddess Diana I offer you The jism
of one I wooed for you That you may
live and know such bliss Of getting
laid by a guy like this
The witches all incant
ALL OF THE WITCHES
So must it be Three times three

They march half-naked as they moan and revel in eerie
cries
The Jacuzzi begins to bubble and boil Their cries
heighten

the potion bubbles over

HOURS LATER
Athena reads from a huge leatherbound book The Book of
Shadows full of potions and spells Four discouraged

witches

pack their bags The room has been restored to its
worldly

under-splendor Kiva uses the remote on the TV so
much

for witchcraft The slab of rock remains a slab

ATHENA
I dont understand what went wrong

ELSPETH
I say Eva pulled one over on us

EVA
What

JEZEBEL
Honey -- Eva was wearing the face of
someone just fucked good and the

best actress in this world or any
other cant fake a thing like that

ELSPETH
Exactly -- if she was fucked so good
how could she save his come

RAVEN
It could be done

ATHENA
Girls knock it off
(she looks up from
the book)
Maybe maybe it needed to be the
sperm of a virgin male

EVA
(dreamily)
He was no virgin

The witches sadly collect their things Athena deep in
thought strokes the slab

ATHENA
Lets leave her here with the sword
until dawn I will come back for her
before checkout time I just feel
too sad to carry her away before the
sun comes up to warm her
as
thought

ELSPETH

Youre carrying my bags

INT DARK HALLWAY

Ted saunters down a hallway with a butt hanging out the
corner

of his mouth and a bucket of ice swinging at his side
He

pulls up at a door on which the faded numbers read
something

like Room 404

Ted knocks on the door After a moment the latch is
thrown

and the door swings open Ted cautiously steps into the
dark

room

INT ROOM

MANS VOICE

In a flash the lights switch on and Ted finds himself
down the barrel of a pretty intense-looking 357
cocked and ready to fire At the other end of the gun
a 50-year-old man Sigfried who sports a Cheshire Cat
and a just try fuckin with me look on his face
isnt the only person in the room Directly behind him
a beautiful young woman Angela gagged and bound to a
Ted drops the bucket to the floor

SIGFRIED
Theodore What do you take me for
Theodore

TED

A very upset man

Sigfried reaches in his pocket and throws a handful of
assorted stimulants into his mouth chewing on them

they were breath mints Sigfried thrusts his hand

gripping Ted by the throat and leads him to Angela
SIGFRIED
(to Angela)
I am an upset man Theodore

TED
How do you know my name sir

SIGFRIED

TED

Look my name is Ted actually and I
have no idea whats going on here

time

SIGFRIED

Lets not belabor the fact that you
have no sense of timing Theodore
The fact is youre here

Sigfried turns to Angela

SIGFRIED
(continuing)
And I couldnt think of a better
time for you to introduce me to your
beau than on New Years Eve

TED
Oh fuck theres a mistake Youre
fucking wrong here My name is
Theodore yes My mother named me
that and I hate the name But Ima
fucking bellhop People call me Ted
I work here

Suddenly with great force Sigfried slams the butt of
his

pistol smack into Teds temple sending him to the
floor

Ted looks up at Sigfried in shock

SIGFRIED

Look Id love to sit here all night
with you talking about things like
when you broke in your first mitt --
(pause)

That was insensitive of me wasnt
it THEODORE But lets cut
to the chase okay

Okay

SIGFRIED
So apologize

A tense silence fills the room All eyes are on Ted
cant figure out what the fuck this guy wants

TED
For what

Sigfried looks hard with disbelief at Ted who winces

SIGFRIED
You are really beginning to annoy
me Theodore

Sigfried throws another handful of pills into his

TED
Look obviously you two are working
something out and if I could help
you with your problem I would

SIGFRIED
What are you saying Are you saying
I got a problem Are you trying to
say I dont give her what she needs
That Im FUCKING INSENSITIVE

drastically he bends down next to Ted

SIGFRIED
Lets get our ABCs right here
Theodore Theodore right

TED

SIGFRIED
Ted okay Are you saying my wife

TED
I didnt say that I

SIGFRIED
Oh for Christs sake Theodore
this is about as intimate a situation
as you can get you me and Angela
here Its pretty cozy To say nothing
of how stupid an idea it is to lie
to a man with a loaded gun without
considering the possible response I
demand an apology

The phone rings

SIGFRIED
Dont move Ive got to take this

Sigfried glances at it Then to Angela He picks up the

phone
SIGFRIED
(into phone)
What
(pause)
We aint got any needles here kid
Just a big fucking gun
He listens to the other line says good-bye and hangs
up
SIGFRIED
(to Ted)
Now where was I Oh yeah I remember
Sigfried kneels next to Ted and assumes a prayer
position
SIGFRIED
I want you to pray for forgiveness
Theodore
Sigfried hands clasped together signals for Ted to do
the
same The gun lies at his side Ted considers a bold
move
but thinks better of it Sigfrieds eyes pop open He
cuts a

look to Ted signaling him to assume the pose

SIGFRIED
(continuing)
Now say after me I apologize

TED
I apologize

SIGFRIED
For what

Ted looks to Angela for help She can only stare back
with
intense wide-open eyes

SIGFRIED
For fucking what

TED
That I said you might have been
unfaithful

SIGFRIED
That I said you might have been
unfaithful Listen Theodore youre
in church here youre kneeling in
front of an altar Truth truth is
all it hears Say the following I
Theodore must humbly and sincerely
apologize for saying that you fucked
another man

Ted repeats what Sigfried has told him This appears to
have

a calming effect on Sigfried who gets up off the
floor

turning his face to Angela

SIGFRIED
(continuing)
Satisfied
Angela nods
SIGFRIED
(continuing)

Do you accept the fucking apology
Naturally Angela says nothing

SIGFRIED
(continuing)
You always gotta get the last word
dont you Its one way with you
Angela isnt it I give and I give
and I get nothing back
Sigfried turns to Ted

SIGFRIED
(continuing)
She just sits there waiting for me
to jump through hoops

Angela attempts to speak through the gag Both men wait
with
bated breath for a response Sigfrieds had enough

SIGFRIED

(continuing)
Stupid me for a second I thought
you were going to say something
something like Im sorry HA
Im sorry Youre absolutely right
love cakes I wouldnt want it that
way Thats one thing you can say
about Angela Shell never do anything
she doesnt want to do If the feeling
aint there she just isnt going to
do it There is nothing in this world

happen to you Theodore It makes
you feel very little indeed

Ted beckons Sigfried

TED

Teds fingers are frozen over Angelas lips
TED
I was just trying to help her breathe

SIGFRIED

Ted starts to back toward the door

TED
Look man if this is some kind of
Voodoo thing and you want me to have
sex with your wife there is
absolutely no way

SIGFRIED
(shouts at the top of
his lungs)
I said nibble asshole Now

The directness of Sigfrieds command coupled with the

SOUND

of a trigger being cocked forces Ted to approach
Angela

Angela is a stunning beauty and Ted being kind of a
shy guy

makes for an awkward situation Ted leans forward As
he

closes in Angelas eyes close
TED
(whispers)
Sorry lady

Ted pulls up short of actually nibbling on Angela
SIGFRIED
Whats the matter no whiz left in
the cheese Im not cramping your
style am 1

TED
Look Im not playing this game
anymore

Sigfried yanks Ted backwards He wraps his arms around
him

SIGFRIED
Its almost all over Theodore and
soon you can go home to Mommy

Ted struggles to free himself from Sigfrieds powerful
bear
hug and blasts out the following monologue

TED
My name is not Theodore its TED
TED TED T E D TED NOT
TEDDY NOT THEODORE TED Yes
my mother did me the service of naming
me Theodore and I havent a clue as
to how you know that because everyone
who knows that lives a long way away
from here Do you have any idea what
its like to go to school where all
the other kids parents are in jail
doing time for crimes like grand
larceny aggravated assault burglary
and murder and you get stuck with a
mother who names you Theodore and
dressed you up in little matching
pink outfits with get this a little
blue bow fucking tie Well Ill
tell you what happens Pretty soon
Theodore becomes Theo the Thumper
and when Theo the Thumper gets old
enough he packs his bags and goes
thousands of miles away where he can
put the whole bloody mess behind
him So if you dont mind shoot me
now because no one is going to call
me that again My name is Ted okay

Its a strange feeling kind of like bathing in warm
in paradise knowing a huge shark is ready to rip his
off He can see the flickering red glowing light from
witches room from the floor below
EXT BATHROOM WINDOW AND BELOW--NIGHT
Ted sees Eva bopping naked past the window He shouts
name out to no avail
The MUSIC drowns out his voice and they ignore his
help The blood rushes to his head He lets himself
there for a moment He wonders how many other people
found themselves in situations like this before him
everyone Right next to his face Ted recognizes a
hand print Its not his blood

EXT BATHROOM WINDOW AND ABOVE--NIGHT

Ted hears a sound from above and twists himself around
spotting a young man (previously seen as the Yuppie

on the phone) leaning out of the window directly above
After a quick moment of sizing him up Ted gathers

TED
Hi
No answer Somethings wrong with the guy all the

blood is
drained from his face and he is mumbling something
TED
Listen Im stuck here in a situation
that I cant even begin to explain
but would you be so kind as to get
help Could you call the police
please
Silence
TED
(continuing)
You okay
The young man manages to belt out the word ice just
before
hurling a mouthful of vomit toward Ted It takes all
Teds
strength to dodge the puke and pull himself back into
the
bathroom He falls back on the floor
He props himself up and checks for damage He notices
something odd the room is silent No Sigfried He
walks
into the bedroom
CUT TO
INT HOTEL BEDROOM--MOMENTS LATER
Ted looks around the still room No ones there
TED
Sigfried
He heads toward the door and from out of the corner of
his
eye he spots Sigfrieds hairy leg Sigfried has passed
out
on the floor Angelas chair has been knocked on its
side
Ted races over to help lift her back up He pulls the
gag

from her mouth Angela jumps all over him

ANGELA
Wheres the fucking nitro

TED
I couldnt find it

ANGELA
You took long enough Untie me for
Christs sake you fucking upset him
and hes dying

Ted struggles to untie Angela

TED
I thought you wanted to kill him

ANGELA
Youd make a great cop Theodore

The knots are all over the place and a real bitch to

untie
TED
I cant handle this alone Id better
get help
Ted turns on a dime and runs smack into Sigfried whos
been

taking in the whole conversation

SIGFRIED
I tie a pretty good knot dont I
Ted

TED

Thank God youre okay

SIGFRIED
Never felt better

Angela hears Sigfrieds voice from behind her back

ANGELA
You bastard

SIGFRIED
(to Angela)
Come on honey dont get mad It
was just a little test and Im glad
I did it because now Ill know forever
that you really do love me Truly
and deeply
hope

Teds

ANGELA
If the simple fact that I didnt
want your bloated dead body lying
out on the floor is love then no
wonder we find ourselves as we are
at this very fucking moment

SIGFRIED
Oh no I heard you and there was
genuine care in that voice Cant be
denied Can it Ted

TED
I think youre right and if you
just keep this kind of open dialogue
going youll go a long way to
resolving this misunderstanding

Ted edges his way toward the door

TED
(continuing)
Youd be surprised what happens when
people just listen to each other
without succumbing to all that pain
and anger

ANGELA
You heard shit monkey boy Easy for
you to say after you fuck another
mans wife You should at least have
the guts to stand by your convictions

Sigfried turns an icy eye on Ted who has given up all
of ever getting out of the room
TED
Thats a lie Sigfried I swear to
God
Angela continues her tirade
ANGELA
When I think of all the times you
were inside me promising me a better
life it makes me want to puke

Sigfried slowly raises his gun pointing it directly at

chest
TED
Why are you doing this What have I
ever done to you people

ANGELA
What didnt you do stick man
Unfortunately you dont have the
balls to back up the actions of your
huge cock

The words hit Sigfried like bullets to the chest his
legs
weaken

SIGFRIED
(whimpering)
Hes got a huge cock

TED
Shes lying again mister Its not
that big

SIGFRIED
Show it to me

TED
Come on man shes lying Cant you
see shes fucking with you

ANGELA

what he did to Gumby with Ted here

SIGFRIED

the
process Meanwhile Ted figures this to be his moment
to
make a move and bolts for the door only to be tackled
by
Sigfried at the one-yard line After a struggle the
two men
rest on the floor catching their breath in a relaxed
embrace

SIGFRIED
Please dont leave me Ill call
you Ted from now on

TED
Its not me mister I swear

SIGFRIED
Personally I dont give a fuck

vulnerable

Sigfried heaves the gun over his shoulder grabs a
half-empty
takes a

bottle of Jack Daniels and passes it to Ted

SIGFRIED
(continuing)

No guns okay Just you and me Ted

You know my father used to say that
forgiveness is the only thing that
evil cant sink its teeth into

TED
Thats beautiful

SIGFRIED
Kind of nice down here on the floor

TED
Yes actually

SIGFRIED
Things take on a whole new

TED

TED

Sigfried releases Ted and stands up

SIGFRIED
Youre lying but I can respect that
Ted If you told me it would no
longer be a secret and secrets have
a power kid You open that box and
they disappear forever A bad secret
will rip you apart but the good one
are all you got In the end when
all the people you knew are dead and
gone all youll have left are you
secrets And when you die the box
is open and it all blows away --

dust to dust -- all the anger
jealousy desire and love just blow
away

Sigfried throws his hand out to help Ted up

SIGFRIED
(continuing)
So you know what I say lets call
it a truce kiddo

Sigfried takes Ted by the hand and leads him to an open

window Ted is overcome by the sweetness in Sigfrieds
voice

and follows him to the window willingly

The two men look out into the dark Los Angeles night
SIGFRIED

(continuing)
Im a man of love Theodore Love is
all I live for

TED
I can see that

SIGFRIED
Maybe to a fault

TED
Dont beat yourself up over it

SIGFRIED
Thats nice of you to say Ted but
I probably should make a clean break
of it cut her loose and get my own
place I just cant imagine living
without her Do you think I should
seek professional help

TED
Its not for everyone but maybe in
your case it could help

SIGFRIED
You ever been out on the ocean at
night

Ted shakes his head

SIGFRIED

(continuing)
I have scary as a motherfucker
all that darkness around you Its
like a big black carpet rolled out
as far as the eye can see Sometimes
if youre lucky youll see a light
It could be as small as a little
spark but it will cut a path straight
through all that blackness straight
to you It could be another boat or
some distant fire on an island but
that light will shed a shining path
of diamonds cutting through mile
after mile of darkness to lie at
your feet Thats love Ted its
like a path of light in an ocean of
darkness

Sarah a little tipsy now grabs the needle and
staggers to

the

needle into the curtain to hide it

Ted enters the room somewhat disheveled from his
encounter

with Sigfried He has a tray and a new bottle of
champagne

He puts the champagne bottle into the empty bucket He
spots

dripping

into the carpet

the painting
Ted smells something funny He looks down and sees the

AFTER A MOMENT OF DARKNESS

After a moment of darkness the night is disturbed by
loud crashing of fireworks outside the window

Sarah sits up eyes closed Her face feels the warmth
from the window and she tilts her head toward it

The light of the fireworks dances its reflections off
face

She inhales deeply then makes a sour face She goes
the bathroom arms outstretched like a blind girl She
to the bathroom turns on the light and searches for
sink
She begins to wash the ointment off her eyes very

She dries her eyes thoroughly and opens them checks

in the mirror A little red but otherwise fine
She goes back into the bedroom turns on the television

grabs the new champagne bottle She shakes it

Juancho wakes He turns his head to her His eyes are
closed

JUANCHO

The champagne bottle explodes She pours herself a
SARAH

Yep If you wanna watch too you

Juancho gets up smiling and tries to run to the
bathroom He
slams into the wall hard

SARAH
Be careful

Juancho walks into the bathroom a little slower more
cautious

Sarah pours herself another glass She downs the glass

and

shudders

She smells the bad smell again Only now she really
smells

it

She smells her feet Nothing She smells the champagne

Nothing

Juancho enters the room and sits on the bed Sarah
grabs his

foot and smells it

She drops his foot

Juancho stares blankly at her

Sarah looks down at the mattress She smells the
mattress

Juancho looks at her as if shes drunk

Sarah leaps off the bed and turns on the room lights
She

takes a huge swig from the champagne bottle then
stalks

toward the mattress

Juancho leaps off the bed as well and stands back

Sarah pulls the mattress off of the bedsprings enough
to see

what is underneath it

Juancho screams Sarah is too stunned to scream
Stuffed

into the bedsprings is a womans dead and beaten
corpse

Now look --

BETTY

Ted hes a very important guest of
this hotel In fact he is the most
important guest at the hotel The
Mon Signor used to be a haven for
movie stars Through the thirties
and forties and the first half of
the fifties more movie stars -- if
you break it down on a night-by-night
basis -- stayed at the Mon Signor
than any other hotel in Hollywood
Now we had some hard time in the
eighties even though we were the
official hotel of Cannon Pictures
but were coming back strong in the
nineties And a movie star clientele
is important to that comeback If we
can keep stars of his magnitude happy
were on our way So Ted just take
care of him then you can leave

TED
Look I dont feel like --

BETTY
He probably just wants some champagne
You can do that cant you Please

staff of the Mon Signor is begging
you

Chester walks over to the table and pours himself some

champagne When he talks now its slower and somewhat
distracted The tone of the scene starts changing

CHESTER

Its quite all right Ted nothing

to feel sorry about Thats why God

invented video But you know Ted a

lot of people did see it
Chester takes a drink of champagne a disgusted look
his face and he slowly puts it down
His manner gives the room a chill

When he talks he addresses the room

CHESTER
Who drank out of this bottle last

No answer

Chester walks over to Ted and fills his glass

CHESTER
Who drank out of this bottle -- not
the other bottles -- this bottle

NORMAN

He spills the champagne from his glass onto the floor

CHESTER
Its fuckin flat Norman thats
whats wrong The champagne -- the

fuckin Cristals fuckin flat
Chester improvises a temper tantrum about the flat
Everyone looks at him not knowing what to say Even
walks over to witness The whole room is uneasy and a
frightened

When Chester finishes his tantrum he turns his
back to Ted As he talks to him he opens up another

bottle
But its not the rapid-pace delivery Chester has done
so
far Its more troubled and distracted
CHESTER
I was saying Ted a lot of people

Leo is still in the doorway making sure his boys cool
LEO

LEO
Thank you

(to Ted)
Ted did you ever watch the old
Alfred Hitchcock Show

TED
(totally bewildered
at this point)
Yeah

LEO
Did you ever see the episode The Man
from Rio with Peter Lorre and Steve
McQueen

TED
I dont think so

LEO

Oh youd remember it all right In
the show Peter Lorre makes a bet
that Steve McQueen cant light his
cigarette lighter ten times ina
row Now if Steve McQueen can light
his cigarette lighter ten times ina
row he wins Peter Lorres new car
If he cant he loses his little
finger

(pause)
Norman and Chester just made the
same bet

(pause)
Normans putting up his pinky against
Chesters mint convertible 1964 red
convertible Chevy Corvelle that he
can light his Zippo ten times ina
row

Pause

Ted looks at all of them taking in the information
before
saying

TED
You guys are drunk

CHESTER
Well that goes without saying but
that doesnt mean we dont know what
were doing
NORMAN
Ill tell ya what Im doin

Norman lays an issue of Hot Classic Cars in front of

Ted on
the bar On the cover is a picture of Chester smiling
standing next to a beautiful 1964 red convertible Chevy
Corvelle The headline reads Hollywoods Hottest New
Star

Next to Americas Hottest Old Car

NORMAN

I drive a motherfuckin Honda my
sister sold me You hear what Im
sayin A little white motherfuckin
Honda Civic

(he holds up the

magazine)
You see this shit

(reading the magazine)
Hollywoods hottest new star next
to Americas hottest old car

(he hands Ted the

magazine)

Now you take a good look at that
machine that this motherfucker over
here is standing next to Thats a
1964 nigger-red rag-top Chevy
Corvelle And I love that car moren
I love hips lips and fingertips
Cut to we sittin here celebrating
gettin high drinkin champagne --

CHESTER
-- Cristal When youre drinkin
anything else youre drinking
champagne When youre drinkin
Cristal you say youre drinkin
Cristal

NORMAN
-- drinkin Cristal Watchin TV
Rockin New Years Eve When all
of a sudden we flip on Steve McQueen
and Peter Lorre bein fuckin badass
And I look at this funny motherfucker
over here and I say Id do that
for the Chevelle

LEO
And Chester replies
CHESTER
Oh really

TED
You guys wouldnt be doin something
this stupid unless you were drunk

Everybody breaks into a here here murmur

NORMAN
I think that pretty much goes without
sayin Wed probably chicken out
But when youre fucked-up you dont
lie You tell the fuckin truth And
the fuckin truth is my lucky Zippos
gonna win me Chesters car

TED
(to Chester)
Why are you doing this

CHESTER
Thrill of the bet Im the one with
something to lose here Cause I can
pretty near guarantee that I love my
car moren Norman loves his pinky

TED
(to Leo)
How bout you guys youre just gonna
sit back and let your friends mutilate
each other

LEO
Why not Life dont get much more
exciting than this I mean if Norman
was puttin his dick on the choppin
block Id step in cause ya know
in the morning wed really regret
that But his pinky Who gives a
fuck I mean theoretically he could
lose that choppin onions tomorrow
Life still goes on

TED
(to Angela)
How bout you

ANGELA
(to Ted)
I dont care
CHESTER
Which brings us to your part in this
little wager

TED
I dont have a part

CHESTER
Now Ted my old granddaddy used ta
say The less a man makes declarative
statements the less hes apt to
look foolish in retrospect Now
therere some inherent obstacles in
this undertaking First of all Im
not some sick fuck like Peter Lorre
on that show travelin the
countryside collecting fingers Were
all buddies here Nobody wants Norman
to lose his finger We just wanna
chop it off So if fate doesnt smile
on ol Norman well put his finger
on ice and rush im to a hospital
where in all likelihood be able to
sew it back on

TED
Hopefully

LEO
Eighty percent

NORMAN
Our side

CHESTER
So Normans protected His interests
have been looked after My interests
on the other hand have not I am as
emotionally attached to my car as
Norman is physically to his finger
Im putting up a very expensive piece
of machinery on this wager Now if
I lose I lose I have no problem
with that Im a big boy I knew
what I was doing However if I win
I wanna win If Norman lights his
lighter ten times in a row hes
gonna have no emotional problems
about taking my car keys whatsoever
But if I win its not inconceivable
that Leo or myself at the last
minute might not be able to wield
calls to

Pause as they all

Ted abruptly gets

Chester whips out

the ax Which brings us full circle
to you Ted Sober Ted Clear-eyed
Ted We want you to be the diceman

ANGELA
Helluva night huh Ted

TED
I gotta get out of here

Ted from his position at the bar

Ted spins

CHESTER
Ted I got a hundred-dollar bill
here with your name on it whether
you do what we ask or not just to
sit back down in the chair for one
minute more

in his direction

TED
Im not gonna cut off his finger

CHESTER
Maybe you will and maybe you wont
but that has nothing to do with this
hundred-dollar bill in my hand You
can tell us all to go fuck off and
walk right out that door But if you
sit back down and wait sixty seconds
before you do it youll be a hundred
dollars richer

Ted just stands across the room thinking

ANGELA
Ted Take the money

LEO
Ted youre gonna do whatever you
want to do Were just askin you to
indulge us for another minute more
And Chesters willin to pay for it

Ted thinks

look at him Angela breaks it

up and makes a beeline for the door

a hundred-dollar bill and quickly
TED
Ill take your money and Ill sit
back down But a minute from now
Im gonna walk out the door and
when I do therell be no hard
feelings

CHESTER

Well I want you to have a bit more
of an open mind than that but yeah
well either convince you or we wont
No hard feelings Right guys

Everybody agrees
Ted wearily sits back down
Chester positions himself in front of Ted at the bar

CHESTER
Okay Leo you be the timekeeper
Let us know when one minute begins
and when it ends

LEO
You got it
(he checks his watch)
Gentlemen start your engines

Chester jumps up and down loosening up

LEO
Begin

Chester who talks fast anyway starts his pitch Its
Chester
who now plays Beat the Clock

CHESTER
Okay pay attention here Ted I
aint got much time Now Im gonna
make two piles here on the bar
(he takes the hundred-
dollar bill and lays
it out on the bar)
One pile
(pointing at the
hundred-dollar bill)
which is yours And another pile
(Chester whips out a
money roll fat enough
to choke a horse to

death)
which could be yours
(he lays a matching
hundred-dollar bill
on the bar starting
a second pile)
Now what you have to be aware of is
were gonna do this bet one way
(he lays another
hundred on the end
pile)
or the other
(he lays another
hundred on the pile)
Whether its you who holds the ax
(he lays another
hundred on the pile)
or the desk clerk downstairs
(he lays another
hundred on the pile)
or some bum we yank off the street
(he lays another
hundred on the pile)

NORMAN
You can buy a lot of soup with that
pile

CHESTER
(to Norman)
Shhhh Im the closer
(to the group)
How much is on the bar already I
lost count

ANGELA
Six hundred

CHESTER
Six hundred Ted do you know how
long it takes the average American
to count to six hundred

TED
No

CHESTER
(laying another bill
on the pile)
One minute less than it takes to
count to seven hundred You know
face

the

Ted looks

FLASHBACK

We see a quick MONTAGE of horrendous moments from all

Ted a persons life is made up of a
zillion little experiences

(he lays another bill

on the pile)
Some which have no meaning are
insignificant and you forget them
And some that stick with you for the
rest of your natural life --

(he lays another bill

on the pile)
-- barring Alzheimers of course
Now what were proposing is so
unusual so outside the norm that I
think it would be a pretty good guess
that this will be one of those
experiences that sticks So since
youre gonna be stuck remembering
this moment for the rest of your
life you gotta decide what that
memory will be

(He lays down the

last bill on the

pile)
So are you gonna remember for the
next forty years give or take a
decade how you refused a thousand
dollars for one seconds worth of
work or how you made a thousand
dollars for one seconds worth of
work

Time

CHESTER
Well Ted whats it gonna be

at the pile then looks up We dolly into his

other stories

INT PENTHOUSE--NIGHT

Back to Ted

TED
Okay

out

The group cheers

TED
But when its over no matter what
happens I get the money

CHESTER
As long as you do your part you can
take the pile walk out the door
and not say another word

TED
Lets do it right now before I change
my mind

NORMAN

Everybody gets in their position by the bar Norman

In his right hand is his Zippo lighter poised and

Norman looks hard at the Zippo in his hand Ted

Norman readies himself

Places his thumb on the wheel in the Zippo

Takes a breath

And strikes

It sparks but doesnt light

Without missing a beat Ted brings down the cleaver
off Normans pinky

Norman lets out a scream

Ted in one move lays down the cleaver scoops up the
and walks out the door

INT HALLWAY--AFTER DAWN

CAMERA is positioned at far end of hallway looking

at the elevator at the other end

Ted walks out of the penthouse in the fg In a MEDIUM

he takes the thousand dollars in his hand looks at it
smiles and sticks it in his pocket It mightve been a

night but its been a profitable one He chuckles at
irony and whistling a happy tune turns his back on
camera and walks down the hall to the elevator

All the while we hear PANDEMONIUM breaking out behind

bucket of ice with the finger goes spilling They run

WE STOP CREDITS

FOUR ROOMS
Angela sticks her key in the door then stops when she
something approaching The look on her face combines
awe and mild shock
Almost floating ethereally a mysterious Blond
wearing Dianas see-through negligee and slippers
with Elspeths sword slung over her shoulder wanders
her She is in a daze perhaps lost or drunk

ANGELA
You okay lady

The bombshell looks up at her dizzily

ANGELA
I said -- you looking for someone
DIANA
(disoriented)
Uhhh yes my husband I think

Have you seen him
Angela and the girl have a strange moment as they
through the eyes
Having had enough emotional intensity tonight Angela
their eye contact

ANGELA
Lady I havent seen anybody

Diana quietly says Ohhh as she drifts on down the
in a daze Angela puts her hand to her temples before
her hotel door She does a double-take on the hallway
empty

She pauses a beat then walks into her room After the
closes we hear Sigfried on the other side

SIGFRIED
Where the hell have you been

CREDITS CONTINUE TO ROLL

THE END
