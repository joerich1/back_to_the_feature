Unless he’s your doctor I don’t
see why a no- touching policy should
affect a professional relationship
That touching had nothing to do
with business and you know it

JILLIAN
What am I supposed to do Knock
his hand off my shoulder

WILL
Yes That’s exactly what you’re
supposed to do

JILLIAN
Will I don’t think a hand on my
shoulder should make you a jealous
psycho

WILL
Why not Because it’s so far-
fetched that you might leave me and
start sleeping with someone like
that Where would I ever come up
with that idea Jillian That’s
just crazy

JILLIAN
Are you seriously still insecure
because of that That was months
ago We live together I am
totally committed to this
