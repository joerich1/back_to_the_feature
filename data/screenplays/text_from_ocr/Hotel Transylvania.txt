The Hotel Transylvania

By
David I Stern

April 8 2005
FADE IN

THE DARK FOREST

The sun sets over the tangled foreboding forest As the last
glimmer of light disappears the wind begins to whistle
eerily through the trees This is a scary place

A crack of lightning A HOWL A FIGURE darts through the
darkness He’s almost translucent in the shadows

Heavy breathing In Out In Out The creature is running at
top speed crunching the dried brush beneath him Each time
he passes through a ray of emerging moonlight he becomes
visible for a brief second --

-- he’s green with pointy ears and stands about three
feet tall In other words - a GOBLIN

The goblin turns and glances over his shoulder Another
sound This one much louder -- hoofbeats and they’ re
following him He bears down worried

Another flash of lightning This time we see the beasts
behind him -- horses only their heads have exposed skulls
They snort smoke and kick up sparks

The goblin huffs and puffs sweating and pushing as hard as
he can The branches grab at him He fights to stay on
course Then the inevitable happens --

The horses catch up He leaps into the air -- and grabs onto
the CARRIAGE that the equine beasts are pulling

They weren’t chasing him after all -- he was chasing them

THE CARRIAGE

The goblin winded pulls himself up to the front of the
carriage and sits next to the driver -- who wears a dark hood
that covers his face

The driver turns revealing a huge pumpkin head with fiery
eyes and scary cut out features

AL
(screaming)
Aaaah
(impressed)
Hey that’s good That’s really
scary
The HEADLESS HORSEMAN faces forward again AL our hero gets
comfortable in his seat

AL (cont’d)
You know you coulda slowed down
for me back there

The horseman looks at him face raging with fire

AL (cont’d)

(backing off)
Just a suggestion No need to get
all hot about it

(muttering)
I woulda slowed down for you
that’s all I’m sayin’ We workin’
stiffs gotta stick together

Quicker than you can blink Al zips behind the Horseman
opens the top of his pumpkin head scoops out some seeds and
zips back to his seat He kicks up his feet

AL (contd)
(munching)
So I’m totally pumped for the big
week You It’s my first one but
I’m ready What say we pick up the
pace a little I don’t want to be --

The horseman flips the reins and the carriage takes off like
a shot

AL (cont’d)
-- laaaaaate

CREDITS BEGIN

Al and the Horseman racethrough fire swamps the Black
Lagoon and dark caves They ride along scary cliff-sides
through mists and across rickety bridges

They climb a steep fog enshrouded hill and finally emerge at -

THE HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA

CREDITS END as the magnificent hotel comes into view It is
Victorian and modern at the same time - filled with
uncountable rooms and indescribable luxury It is horrific
and beautiful Massive and unbelievable
The carriage pulls up outside the massive gates to the hotel
and stops Al buddy-punches the Horseman on the arm
AL
See ‘ya later big guy

The Horseman buddy-punches him back sending Al sailing down
to the ground

The goblin gets up dusts himself off and looks through the
gates at the hotel -- it is simply awesome

A LOUD HONK from behind him Al spins to see a carriage
waiting to enter the WOLFMAN and his FAMILY in the back

Al steps aside as the gates open

WOLFMAN
Hey kids - take a look

The TWO WEREWOLF KIDS poke their heads out the side window

WOLFMAN (cont’d)
This is the greatest hotel in the
whole world You guys are gonna
love it here

KIDS
(both at once)
Can we go to the pool Can we dig
out back Can we race Can we --

WOLFMAN
Ok calm down Tell you what - you
two go play in the cemetery while
we check in -- ok

Dad opens the carriage door and the kids run off - barking
and howling

WOLFMAN (cont’d)
(to his wife)
Finally - a few minutes to
ourselves

He growls a sexy growl as the carriage enters the driveway

WOLFMAN’S WIFE (0S)
Oh you are a bad dog

The gates shut - again locking Al outside He looks through
the gates for a moment more then turns and heads around the
side of the hotel
EMPLOYEES ENTRANCE

A crowd of WITCHES and SKELETONS are arriving for work The
witches are dressed as chefs maids and waitresses among
others The skeletons are dressed as bellboys masseurs and
poolboys among others

Al joins the group and heads inside

MASSEUR SKELETON
Hey Al

AL
Hey Slim - youll never guess who I
saw pulling in The Wolfman Can
you believe it

MASSEUR SKELETON
It’s the week after Halloween
buddy - everybody’s gonna be here

Al reaches the employee check in -- and flirts with the WITCH
behind the desk

AL
Betty

WITCH
Hey Al You seem particularly
cheerful today

AL
It’s gonna be a great week
(squinting)
Is that a new mole
(closer)
With a hair And pus Truly
disgusting

WITCH
(genuine)
Thank you hon
(bragging)
I think it’s infected

She checks him in and he steps into the main hallway
Immediately a SKELETON BELLBOY grabs Al and slams him up
against the wall

ASSHOLE SKELETON
Hey wart - it’s about time you got
here
(MORE)
ASSHOLE SKELETON (contd)
(an inch from Al’s face)
Where are my clean shirts

AL
(gagging from his bad
breath)
Probably with your breath mints

ASSHOLE SKELETON
Youre a regular laugh riot

The skelton stuffs several dirty pairs of pants into Al’s
shirt

ASSHOLE SKELETON (cont’d)
I want ‘em all by the end of the
staff meeting Pressed and ironed
Or I will come back and find you

The skeleton drops the goblin to the floor and heads outside
Al pulls the dirty pants out of his shirt

AL
(calling after him)
Pressed and ironed are the same
thing
(under his breath)
Moron

Al heads downs the hallway to a BOOKSHELF at the end He
grabs a TORCH from the wall next to it - causing the
bookshelf to rotate and reveal a hidden staircase

Al walks down the massively long set of stairs to the sub-sub
basement

THE LAUNDRY

Al takes a breath prepares himself then opens the door to
the laundry He is immediately grabbed by a GHOST SHEET and
flung against the far wall

The gigantic room is filled with FLYING white sheets
pillowcases towels and all the other linens of the Hotel
Transylvania The laundry is completely out of control

MUMMY
Help

Al looks over to see THE MUMMY -- tied between two posts by a
pair of bed sheets As the sheets hold Mummy still the
towels rat-tail him -- causing him to yelp in pain
AL
Mummy Hang on

Al races across the room toward his friend but before he can
get there a pillowcase dives over his head blinding him Al
struggles to pull off the case as a sheet scoops him up and
flings him to another sheet - which in turn flings him into a
VAT of water

Al manages to gets the wet case off of his head and starts to
climb out of the vat Several sheets reach up from under the
water and pull him back in

AL (cont’d)
Mummy Where’s the sock

MUMMY
I don’t know I lost it

AL
(frustrated)
Again

MUMMY
I’m sorry

Al wrestles with the sheets holding him down and manages to
tie them together He climbs out of the vat just as a hand

towel scoops up a bunch of clothes pins and flings them at

him machine-gun style

Al dives does a somersault then leaps into a huge pile of
dirty clothes -- barely avoiding the projectiles

Mummy looks over

MUMMY (cont d)
Al
(a beat worried)
Al

Finally with a ROAR Al bursts from the pile - holding up a
RED SOCK

AL
Back off - all of you

All of the white linens turn to Al A beat Al holds the sock
over the vat of water

AL (contd)
What You think I don’t have the
guts
Al eyes them He looks pretty unstable He loosens his grip
on the sock one finger at a time When he is down to just
his thumb and pointer --

AL (cont’d)
I hope you like pink

The linens panic

In a flurry of activity the sheets let go of the Mummy The
towels quiver in fear The pillowcases fold themselves as
small as they possibly can

AL (cont’d)
Thats right Fluffed and folded
Like you know I like it

Al slowly turns around to face Mummy then quickly spins back
- holding out the sock The linens cower at the move Al
cracks his neck then walks over to his friend

AL (cont’d)
(helping him up)
You ok
MUMMY
Yeah
AL
You gotta stand up for yourself
Mummy
MUMMY
(defeated)

Yeah I know You’re right I’m
sorry It’s just this stupid curse

Al rolls his eyes - he’s heard it all before

Just then a HUGE batch of sheets falls through the laundry
chute onto the floor Both Al and Mummy look over

MUMMY (cont’d)
Vacation week begins

They head over to the new sheets and start sorting
AL

Mark my words Mummy - some day I’m
gonna sleep in these sheets
MUMMY
Well if you work hard enough you
could make manager

AL
Don’t think so small my meek
mummified mate I don’t want to
manage this place I want to be a
guest

(thumping his chest)

There’s a fearsome monster trapped
inside this puny goblin body And
once I let it out - there’s no
stopping me

Al plunges a pile of sheets into the vat of water and starts
scrubbing

AL (cont ad)
I’ve even got a plan

MUMMY
Really

AL

Yep You know who’s gonna be here
this week Count Dracula I’m gonna
convince him to give me the bite of
everlasting life and turn me into a
vampire

Mummy does a double take

MUMMY
Are you out of your mind

AL
Sane as a skeleton Look I’ma
goblin - you know what’s out there
for me A life of stealing things
hiding people’s keys living in the
shadows Useless stuff I came here
to be something more I came here
to be something great

MUMMY
If Dracula bites you he’s not
gonna give you “the gift” He’s
gonna suck out all your blood and
kill you
AL
Nice He’s not gonna kill me The
hotel has a truce

MUMMY
A truce Please You don’t know
these guys Al They do what they
want -

Al pulls a sheet out of the water and points it toward the
clothes line It flies over and pins itself up

AL
I’1ll be fine

Mummy sighs

MUMMY
Well it’s not like you’re gonna
get near him anyway

AL
Why not

MOMMY
Because he’s Count Dracula Most of
us only get a quick glimpse of him
when he checks in and when he
checks out

Al suddenly lights up

AL
Really

MUMMY
Yeah

AL

Youre a genius

MUMMY
I am

Al runs over and grabs the skeleton’s dirty clothes

AL
Thanks Mummy

Al heads out the door Mummy watches him go confused

AL’S PLAN

Al heads outside to the back of the hotel The SKELETON
BELLBOYS - including the asshole from earlier - are lined up
for the nightly staff meeting The boss MR HYDE lectures
them like a drill sergeant

HYDE
the guests are here to rest in
peace No star-struck blabbering or
lollygagging Do I make myself
clear

ALL
Yes Mr Hyde

Hyde continues his lecture as Al slips into the shadows --
becoming translucent and difficult to see He makes his way
out to the cemetery where the Wolfman’s kids are digging up
bones

WEREWOLF KID 1
Found one

He pulls out a rib

WEREWOLF KID 2
Found one too

He pulls out an arm -- which turns out to be attached to a
ZOMBIE who pulls himself out of the ground The kids scream
with glee and take off running

Al slips into their path

AL
Hey kids Welcome to the Hotel T
Wanna play a really fun game

The goblin holds out one of the skeleton’s pairs of pants
The kids smell it like a couple of dogs

Meanwhile Hyde continues his lecture

HYDE
discretion I don’t want to hear
one word of gossip coming from your
jawbones What happens at the Hotel
T stays at the Hotel T Do I make
myself clear

ALL
Yes Mr Hyde

Just then the Wolfman’s kids race over chomp the asshole
skeletori’s femur and take off running with it

ASSHOLE SKELETON
Hey Those kids stole my leg

The skeleton hops after them Al quickly slips out of the
shadows

AL
Did I hear you’ re a man short

THE HOTEL LOBBY

High ceilings Stained glass windows with scenes of horror
and gore A huge FOUNTAIN with cascading ooze in the center

The lobby is both magnificent and creepy And it’s packed
with ZOMBIES BLOBS WEREWOLVES GHOSTS THE FLY HUGE
BRAINED LADIES and every other monster imaginable

Smack in the middle of the chaos is Al - now wearing a
bellboy uniform He hustles in and out of the hotel carrying
bags for the arriving guests

ZOMBIE KID
(to his mom)
Do they have a lagoon

ZOMBIE MOM
A black lagoon
ZOMBIE KID
Oooh
BLOB

(to her friend)
I’m hoping to meet someone large
amorphous and squishy

BLOB’S FRIEND
You can say that again girlfriend

GHOST
(to his wife)
Honey did you remember to pack my
chains

Suddenly a cold wind starts to blow through the lobby
Chills pass through the group Everyone stops what they’re
doing and looks up

DRACULA’S ARRIVAL

A fluttering sound followed by a high-pitched screech Two
BATS swoop in and circle the room

CROWD
(muttering)
It’s him Oh my god I can’t
believe it

Al’s adrenaline starts to rush The bats fly slow acrobatic
loops high into the rafters The crowd backs away from the
center of the lobby - creating a space for them to land

The bats dip and with a puff of smoke turn into COUNT
DRACULA and his daughter MAVIS

Mavis is a 21-year-old female version of her father Slicked
back hair tight black formal dress Goth makeup She is
monster royalty beautiful and regal

Al sees her and is immediately smitten

DRACULA
(bold and full of thunder)
I am

He looks around the room dramatically You can hear a pin
drop

DRACULA (cont’d)
-Count Dracula

A LADY GHOST faints - and falls through the zombie behind her
who tries to catch her Several CHILDREN WEREWOLVES hide
behind their parents

DRACULA (cont’ d)
(to his daughter)
Come Mavis Let us check in

MAVIS
Yes father

They make their way to the check-in desk -- parting the crowd
like the Red Sea A few of the guests approach the Prince of
Darkness and kiss his ring as he passes

Al sees the Count’s coffins luggage and other belongings by
the front entrance He races over

AL
(slipping through the
crowd)
Excuse me Sorry Coming through

He gets to the luggage cart at the same time as another
BELLBOY

AL (cont’d)
I can take this

SKELTON BELLBOY
That’s ok I’ve got it
AL
No really it’s not a problem
Al tries to pry the skeleton’s hands from the cart The
skeleton in turn tries to box Al out Al climbs up the
skeleton’s rib cage grabs the hanging bar and pushes him

away with his feet The skeleton pokes a bony finger into
Al’s foot

AL (cont’d)
Ow

Not far away a proper English Gentleman DR JECKYLL is
chatting with a ZOMBIE

JECKYLL

And if you need a hand - or a foot
for that matter - please don’t
hesitate to call

He sees Al and the skeleton wrestling

JECKYLL (cont’d)
Excuse me

Jeckyll marches over to the two bellboys and immediately
turns into Mr Hyde He grabs Al by the collar

HYDE
What did I say about resting in
peace

With a swift kick he punts the goblin out the front door He
then transforms back into Dr Jeckyll

JECKYLL
(making light of it to the
nearby guests)
It’s so difficult to dig up good
help these days

OUTSIDE

Al tumbles head over heels ultimately landing in the
driveway He stands up and clears his head

Suddenly a loud ROAR behind him Al spins to see a MASSIVE
DUISENBERG heading right for him

AL
Aaaaaugh

The car runs him over

BENEATH THE CAR
Al stands -- he actually fits under the gigantic vehicle

The rear door opens and a giant foot clomps onto the entry
way of the hotel The crowd turns to see who it is

Another foot clomps out of the car The door slams and the
Duisenberg pulls away Al can finally see its occupant
FRANKENSTEIN - the myth the legend

The crowd takes a collective breath staring up at the
towering beast Frankenstein puts his arms out before him and
slugs forward like he does in the classic films

- The crowd slowly backs up Frankenstein moans

He walks toward the entrance hits his head on the upper door
frame and falls backwards -- slamming onto the concrete with
a loud THUD

Al along with the crowd GASPS

A beat then Frank pushes off of his hands and does a back
flip -- ending up standing upright

FRANKENSTEIN
It’s alive

The crowd cheers

CROWD
Alive

Al immediately grabs a cart of Frankenstein’s luggage and
uses all of his strength to push the gargantuan belongings
into the lobby

THE LOBBY

Frankenstein struts through the lobby like a true star
Everyone wants to shake his hand Everyone wants to touch
him A vast difference from Count Dracula

FRANKENSTEIN
(to a WEREWOLF DAD)
Werewolf Hoooowl the hell are you
(to the WEREWOLF’s FAMILY)
Hey - it’s the whenwolf and the
whywolf

He stoops down to a ZOMBIE KID

FRANKENSTEIN (cont’d)
Pull my finger

The kid pulls and the finger comes right off

FRANKENSTEIN (contd)
Whoa hey Give that back

Frankenstein laughs as he grabs his digit He then spots one
of the ladies with an enormous exposed brain and sidles up to
her

FRANKENSTEIN (cont’d)
Hey there sexy

In a Fred Astaire- like move he spins her and dips her deeply
- planting a kiss right on her lips

As he releases her she swoons -- getting caught by her
nearby huge-brained friend

HUGE BRAINED LADY
I I think I love him

HUGE BRAINED FRIEND
Oh please He’s only after you for
your mind

Al pushes Frank’s luggage past him trying to get back to the
check-in desk where Dracula and Mavis are standing

Speaking of the Count

THE CHECK-IN DESK

Dracula talks to the APPARITION behind the counter while
Mavis stands regally to the side

DRACULA
This is not my usual suite

APPARITION
No sir The Wolfman and his family
required a larger room so we

DRACULA
(cutting him off)
Unsatisfactory

MAVIS
Father please you’re making a
scene

DRACULA
(ignoring her)
What if they tragically died in the
next twenty minutes or so

APPARITION
Sir There is no killing at the
Hotel Transylvania

Just then Al shows up with Frank’s luggage - completely
winded He looks up at Mavis She’s just so beautiful She
glances down at him and he immediately gets a lump in his
throat

Trying to act suave Al leans on the luggage cart It rolls
slightly and he slides off onto the floor Mavis suppresses

a giggle
Dracula notices the monogrammed “F” on the luggage
DRACULA

(annoyed)
Oh brilliant

He looks back to see Frank heading his way

DRACULA (cont’d)
(to the apparition)
Fine I’1l1 take your inferior
suite

APPARITION
Yes sir

Al straightens himself and prepares to ask his all-important
question Dracula glances back again Frank is getting
closer still glad-handing the guests

APPARITION (cont d)
Could I interest you in a treatment
at the spa

DRACULA
(hurrying him along)
Just give me the key

APPARITION
Perhaps a reservation at “Fears”

DRACULA
No Just the key

Dracula looks back to find Frank He’s lost him in the crowd
Where is he

DRACULA (cont’d)
Hurry

Al sees his opportunity and makes a move

AL
Excuse me I was --

Before he can finish Frankenstein steps between them

FRANKENSTEIN
Vlad

DRACULA
(with faux joy)
Frank

FRANKENSTEIN
(arms extended coaxing)
Come on

Dracula reluctantly steps forward as Frank grabs him in an
enormous bear hug and shakes him around like a long lost frat
brother

Al regroups He’1l have to wait for another chance

Frank-plops Dracula back on the floor rumpled and with his
hair all to one side

DRACULA
(forcing a smile)
Delightful

The Count tries to straighten his clothes - it’s a lost
cause

FRANKENSTEIN
POD How are you doing big guy

DRACULA
(aside to Mavis)
P0OD

MAVIS
Prince of Darkness

DRACULA
(under his breath)
That’s idiotic
(to Frank)
Things have never been better F

FRANKENSTEIN
I see you took your daughter
shopping again in your closet

Mavis laughs Dracula silences her with a glare

DRACULA
Mavis is dressed appropriately as
always

MAVIS
It’s a pleasure to see you again
Frank

FRANKENSTEIN
You too doll Still seeing that
Nosferatu boy

MAVIS
Brian No he’s not exactly

DRACULA
(interrupting)
They’ re working things out In
fact he’1l be arriving later
tonight

Mavis - clearly surprised at this news - gives her father a
look He ignores her

Al meanwhile looks over at Hyde - who is looking right at
him

AL
Oh no

Hyde starts to stomp over Al looks around for a place to
hide

DRACULA
Oh I have something you might
enjoy A little souvenir from my
last trip -

He takes out a small Frankenstein FIGURINE and pops back its
head - revealing a cigarette lighter As the flame ignites
Frank backs away freaked

FRANKENSTEIN
Aaah
MAVIS
(chastising)
Father
DRACULA

(shutting it off)
Oh of course The phobia Terribly
sorry

Al can feel his opportunity slipping away Hyde is almost
there What to do Should he just jump up and get Dracula’s
attention Let it go and hope for another chance

Then he sees it Dracula’s coffin He zips over and slips
inside

Hyde stomps between Dracula and Frank breaking up their
conversation He looks around Where did that goblin go He
transforms back into Jeckyll

JECKYLL
(excusing himself)
Excuse me Gentlemen I was just
coming over to welcome you to the
hotel

We CLOSE IN on the coffin as we DISSOLVE TO

DRACULAS SUITE

The coffin lid slowly creaks open Al peeks out and scans
Certain he’s alone he quickly climbs out Dracula’s room

AL
Wow

The capes The starched white shirts The hair gel
A loud CLICK A key in the door Al quickly hides

DRACULA
(entering)
You’re just encouraging him when
you laugh at his jokes

MAVIS
I think he’s sweet

DRACULA
He’s a second-rate vulgarian What
kind of monster’s afraid of fire

anyway

MAVIS
What kind of monster’s afraid of
garlic

DRACULA

I’m not afraid I’m allergic
There’s a big difference

Mavis takes her capes and hangs them in the ARMOIRE When she
closes the door a translucent figure is revealed in the
darkened corner of the room It’s Al

He quickly zips under the wardrobe and watches the two
vampires from there

ALS POV
MAVIS
Ready to go to the belfry
DRACULA
Later
MAVIS

But you said we would go after we
checked in

DRACULA
Later Mavis I need a chance to
unwind I’m famished from the
flight And this room is simply
inadequate

Dracula tries to adjust the two coffins so they fit
comfortably

MAVIS
We spend one week a year together
and still it’s always “later” with
you

DRACULA
I£ youre in such a hurry why
don’t you just go now

MAVIS
Fine I will

Mavis heads to the door Dracula sighs - he just doesn’t get
his daughter anymore

Mavis opens the door and edges past the WITCH who’s standing
there about to knock

WITCH
Room service

The witch pushes a long gurney with a huge steel entree-cover
over it into the room

DRACULA
Yes yes Ill take it from here

Dracula rolls the gurney into the room as the witch leaves
He removes the entree-cover revealing a HUMAN WOMAN beneath
She sees Dracula and starts to panic He quickly mesmerizes
her

DRACULA (cont’ d)
Look into my eyes

The woman relaxes getting drawn deeply into the master’s
trance

Al glances at the bedroom mirror Only the woman has a
reflection

AL
(mouthing)
Awesome

Dracula bares his fangs They are razor sharp and glistening
with anticipation Al is completely enthralled

The Prince of Darkness stands up straight majestically
spreading his cape Al holds his breath

DRACULA
Soon you and I will be one

The Count swirls his cape and scoops the woman in his arms
pulling her pale smooth neck close In the process he turns
and blocks Al’s view

The goblin looks for a better vantage point The coffin No
The table with the clock No Then he spies the shadow under
Dracula’s cape Perfect

In an instant Al is barely visible beneath the billowing
cape

DRACULA (cont’d)
(drinking in her smell)
Intoxicating

The cape flutters above Al He can’t resist the urge to reach
out and ever so lightly touch it

Dracula stops He spins But no one’s there A beat He goes
back to his seduction

DRACULA (cont’d)
Embrace your destiny

The woman moans

A wind starts to blow through the room Dracula opens his
mouth wide carnivorous fangs at the ready The woman’s eyes
swirl in submission

DRACULA (contd)
I want

A small green face slowly fills the space between Dracula and
his victim

DRACULA (contd)
-to suck

Als eyes are wide open This is the coolest thing he’s ever
seen

AL and DRACULA
»your blood

Dracula stops He looks over at Al

AL
Sorry

The woman falls out of her trance She screams scampers away
from Dracula gets caught up in the sofa cushions and falls
to the floor She then stands and runs into the wall
knocking herself down

She gets up again finds the door -- and bolts out of the
room

A beat

With lightning speed Dracula grabs Al by the collar He
holds him up to the light - making him fully visible

DRACULA
A goblin

Dracula starts to growl

DRACULA (cont’d)
Prepare to die

He opens his mouth to take a big bite

AL
Aaaah

The vampire chomps down hard but rather than sinking into
Al’s head his fangs crunch into the BEDSIDE ALARM CLOCK that
Al’s put in the way

Dracula spits out the crushed pieces and goes in for another
chomp This time Al reaches into the Count’s mouth and pulls
out his tongue - causing Dracula to bite it

DRACULA
Aaaugh

He drops the goblin and grabs his tongue in pain Al races
for the door But Dracula gets there first blocking his
exit

AL
Remember the truce

DRACULA
(lisping from his tongue
injury)
Thcrew the truthe

The Count winces from the pain then lunges for Al Al
quickly wedges himself between the wall and the armoire
scampering to the top ala Jackie Chan

The Count swirls his cape knocking Al to the floor - only to
miss him once again as Al rolls under the couch Dracula
drops to all fours and looks under

No Al

Dracula grabs the couch and lifts the entire frame --
exposing Al who is spread-eagled underneath holding on for
dear life Al drops to the floor runs under the Count’s legs
and leaps into the bathroom shutting the door behind him
Dracula grabs the door knob and turns it It’s locked
Dracula throws his cape around himself poofs into a bat and
flies under the bathroom door -

INSIDE THE BATHROOM

-- reappearing directly behind Al

Al SCREAMS and races back out

OUT OF THE BATHROOM

Count Dracula steps out of the bathroom and immediately his
pants drop around his ankles - causing him to trip forward
and face plant into the floor

A beat

DRACULA
Goblin Give me back my belt

No response Dracula slowly gets up
DRACULA (cont’ d)
I know you’re still in here I can
smell you

Holding his pants up with one hand Dracula feigns a lunge --
hoping to scare Al into revealing himself

It doesn’t work

DRACULA (cont’d)
I promise I won’t kill you That
belt has a certain sentimental
value

A beat

DRACULA (cont’d)
My daughter made it for me at camp

Another beat then --

AL (05S)
How do I know youll keep your
word

Dracula spins in the direction of the voice but still can’t
see him

DRACULA
You don’t But if you keep the
belt I will hunt you down for the
rest of your natural days

Al appears from the shadows holding the belt out in front of
him Dracula snatches it and starts to put it back on

A beat

AL

(nervous rambling)
Um so my name is Al and I just
want you to know that I’m a huge
fan I think you’re the greatest
monster that’s ever lived and the
reason I snuck in here is because I
want to be a great monster like
you And I was hoping umm Would
you turn me into a vampire

Dracula looks at Al for a second

DRACULA
No

AL
Please

DRACULA
No

AL

Why not

Dracula starts to back Al toward the front door

DRACULA
Because I don’t give “the gift” to
just anyone They have to be
worthy prepared educated It’s a
long process And frankly you’re a
goblin and don’t have what it
takes

Dracula bumps into one of the coffins He grunts annoyed

DRACULA (cont’d)
Now if you don’t mind I have some
room difficulties to deal with

AL
But Count Dracula sir I know I
can be a great monster I can feel

it

DRACULA
Sad for you then

AL
Please

DRACULA
Get out

Dracula reaches over Al and opens the front door Al avoids
being hit as the door bangs into the gurney

DRACULA (cont’d)
(annoyed)
This room is just too small

AL
(backing into the hall)
I can get you a bigger one
The Count stops

DRACULA
What was that

AL
I can get you a bigger suite Any
one you want in the whole hotel

Dracula pauses intrigued

DRACULA
Really I’1l1 tell you what - get me
the Wolfman’s suite and I’1l
consider helping you

AL
Thank you Count Dracula You won’t
regret --

SLAM Dracula shuts the door

AL (cont’d)
it

Al stands alone in the hallway letting what just happened
sink in

AL (contd)
How on earth am I going to get him
the Wolfman’s suite

And as if his chances weren’t bad enough Hyde steps out of
the elevator and sees him

HYDE
You

OUTSIDE
Al tumbles out the front door and into the street once again

Suddenly another HUGE DUISENBERG pulls up AL screams as it
races over him

AL
Aaaaaugh

The rear door opens and the DIVORCEE OF FRANKENSTEIN steps
out

She is a serious hottie -- half monster half vixen --
dressed from head to toe in vacation garb Even her hair is
set in corn-rows (all black with a white row down the side of
course)

Al quickly steps out from under the car and goes for her
luggage Like Frankenstein’s the luggage is huge bulky and
extremely heavy

Al tries to lift the bags one at a time He can’t even budge
them Finally he grabs the Divorcee’s purse and drags it
inside

’

AL (cont’d)
Well if I can’t get him the suite
he could always move into this bag

THE CHECK-IN DESK

The Divorcee approaches the desk with Al struggling behind
her Jeckyll eyes Al as he passes

Frankenstein meanwhile is still chatting up the guests
nearby

FRANKENSTEIN
So I say “Bolt Youve gotta be
nuts”

The group laughs then grows uncomfortably quiet as they see
the Divorcee Frank turns around

He immediately changes from the talkative life-of-the-party
we know to a moaning groaning mess

FRANKENSTEIN (cont d)
Rrrrrr Womaaaan

DIVORCEEB
Articulate as always I see It’s a
wonder I stayed married to you as
long as I did
(to the apparition behind
the desk)
I’ll have my usual suite

APPARITION
I’m sorry Bride of

The Divorcee coughs

APPARITION (cont’ d)
-er Divorcee of Frankenstein
that suite is taken

DIVORCEE
(to Frank)
You took OUR room

FRANKENSTEIN -
Rooom Gooood

Frank slams his fists onto the counter causing it to
partially collapse The Divorcee rolls her eyes at the macho
display

APPARITION
I can give you the Burial Suite

DIVORCEE
But that room doesn’t have any
equipment How am I supposed to do
my hair without that spinning
sparking thing

FRANKENSTEIN
(vipping the collapsed
counter out of the floor)
Hair Baaaad

DIVORCEE
No one’s paying any attention to
you Frank”
(to the Apparition)
Unless you can take all the
equipment out of his suite and put
it into mine I’m not interested

Als eye’s go wide A pian

THE WOLFMAN’S SUITE

The Wolfman relaxes flipping through the daily paper as his
wife gets dressed in the next room

WOLFMAN
Honey - I found the obits

WOLFMAN’S WIFE (0S)
Good Put them in the corner by the
window

The Wolfman takes the section out of the paper and spreads it
on the floor by the window -- a place to poop

The wife steps into the doorway of the adjoining rooms

WOLFMAN’S WIFE (cont’d)
Perfect Are you going to wear that
shirt

WOLFMAN
(in classic husband
fashion)
No

She goes back to dressing as he heads over to the armoire He
opens it and takes out a Hawaiian print

WOLFMAN (cont’d)
(holding it up in the
doorway)
Hows this one

WOLFMAN’S WIFE (0S)
We’ re going to a dinner party not
a funeral

The Wolfman goes back to the armoire and opens it again Only
this time it’s empty

Confused the Wolfman closes the door takes a beat then re--
opens it Now it’s filled with capes

He turns around and runs right into a coffin in the middle of
the room He turns back around and finds himself face to face
with the Prince of Darkness
WOLFMAN
(surprised)
Count Dracula

The Wolfman scans the room All of the furniture and
belongings are different

WOLFMAN (cont d)
(calling out to his wife)
Honey I think we’re in the wrong
room
We CLOSE IN on Dracula’s slow dark smile

DISSOLVE TO

LATER

Dracula and Al relax in the sitting area of his new suite

DRACULA
Very impressive

AL
Thank you

DRACULA

So what else do you have for mé

AL
What do you mean

DRACULA
Oh come now Al Don’t be a fool
Moving things around is nice but
knowledge is power I’m sure you
know many things that go on at this
hotel

AL
You mean like gossip

DRACULA
“Gossip” is such a vulgar word I
prefer “information”

Al starts to get uncomfortable

AL
We’re not really supposed to talk
about the other guests

DRACULA
And I suppose swapping suites is
condoned

AL
But that was

DRACULA
(cutting him off)
I understand

Dracula walks to the front door and opens it

DRACULA (cont’d)
It’s been very nice meeting you
Al I wish you best of luck in all
your endeavors It’s a shame our
little business arrangement
couldn’t continue

Al slowly stands He looks at the room around him -- a world
he will now never know He walks haltingly to the door

He was so close He could almost taste it
AL
Frankenstein and his bride are
divorced
Dracula lets the door close intrigued

DRACULA
Are you certain

AL
Yes And when Frankenstein saw her
he lost it I mean he was breaking
stuff he couldn’t speak

Dracula smiles the smile of a predator who’s luring his prey
into a trap

DRACULA
Now that wasn’t so hard was it

Al knows he’s crossed a line but what choice did he have

DRACULA (cont’d)
I’m throwing a little gathering
tonight in the 13th floor ballroom
Why don’t you drop by

Really
DRACULA

Yes
AL

I I can’t I have to work
DRACULA

Easily taken care of
Dracula picks up the phone

DRACULA (cont’ d)
(into the phone)
Get me Dr Jeckyll
(to Al putting a hand
over the mouthpiece)
Shall we say midnight And wear
something festive

Off of Al’s reaction we DISSOLVE TO

“BLOODBATH AND BEYOND”

The end-all be-all in monster luxury Al steps into the lobby
of the spasalon passing by several MONSTERS lounging by the
piranha-filled fish tanks - enjoying the relaxing sound of
teeth crunching bone

Slim the skeleton masseur we met earlier hurries over

SKELETON MASSEUR
We’re gonna give you the full
treatment

He leads him toward the back area

AL
Thanks for hooking me up Slim
Youre a real lifesaver

SKELETON MASSEUR
What are friends for

Slim opens the door to the back and we follow him down the
long corridors of the spa peeking into the various treatment
rooms as we pass

- A blob getting a green mystic tan
- Several LADY WEREWOLVES getting their hair done

LADY 1
I was thinking of going blonde

LADY 2
Everywhere

- Frankenstein lying on a typical METAL SLAB with a MAD
SCIENTIST racing around performing the massage As the angle
shifts we see that each of Frank’s body parts is ona
different table

The scientist throws switches and spins dial Lightning arcs
between ancient pieces of electronic equipment

The mad scientist unscrews the top of Frank’s head and starts
to massage his brain He sticks his hands deep inside the
skull and squeezes

FRANKENSTEIN
Mmmmm That feels good

Suddenly the brain squirts through his fingers and onto the
floor

Frankenstein goes limp

The scientist looks around to make sure no one saw then
scoops up the brain and puts it back in Immediately Frank
comes back to life

FRANKENSTEIN (cont’d)
You have magic hands

Slim finally reaches the room for Al and opens the door Al
steps inside

AL’S PARTY PREP
His treatments include

- An ELECTRIC SHOCK that makes his three hairs stand on end
to be cut

A MAGGOT BATH to eat off all the dirt

LEACHES attached to his skin that suck out his blood --
making him flat and the leaches huge The leaches are then
squeezed and Al reinflated

- Al is then fitted with clothes A series of shirts pants
and jackets are tried until they finally land on the perfect
ensemble a plaid jacket plaid pants red shirt and white
tie

But the suit’s too large The SKELTON TAILORS confer and come
up with a solution

Al is stretched on the RACK until the suit fits

Freshly pampered and dressed Al is ready to go

THE HOTEL ELEVATOR

Al checks himself in the reflective panels of the elevator as
he listens to the pleasant MUZAK

The elevator stops on the third floor and THE FLY gets on
He moves to the side and frenetically rubs his hands
together

Al tries to make conversation

AL
You going to the party

The fly angles its head so that Al can see his own reflection
in all hundred of its eyes but doesn’t say a word

AL (cont’d)
(with some confidence)
I’m going It’s-gonna be great
Dracula invited me The D man
himself Personally Who invited
you

The fly doesn’t answer but instead moves a little closer to
Al - still rubbing his hands together

AL (cont’d)
I guess it doesn’t really matter I
hear pretty much everybody’s gonna
be there How long have you known
him

The fly moves even closer rubbing his hands faster and
starting to salivate a little

AL (cont’d)
My youre a closestander aren’t
you

DING The elevator has reached the 13th floor Al looks
forward just as the fly opens its jaws wide behind him

But before the fly can chomp the elevator doors open to
reveal --

THE 13TH FLOOR BALLROOM

The ornate Gothic ballroom is filled with monsters of all
shapes and sizes Frankenstein werewolves zombies witches
serving cocktails skeleton waiters blobs hugebrained
ladies the CREATURE FROM THE BLUE LAGOON and others

Al steps into the room and in an extended TRACKING SHOT we
follow Al as he sees

- Monsters eating drinking dancing and enjoying themselves
in the relaxed atmosphere

- The PHANTOM OF THE OPERA playing piano from a small stage
in the front

- Two werewolves slurping from a large pile of intestines --
ultimately ending up in a kiss ala “Lady and the Tramp”

Mavis looking bored sitting next to BRIAN NOSFERATU -- an
old-style bald vampire who has his face buried in a bowl of
entrails -- slurping and splattering away

MAVIS
(sarcastic)
Don’t be afraid to dig in Brian

- A massive ice sculpture in the center of the room of
Dracula biting a victims neck

Blood drizzles out of the puncture wounds -- filling the
waiting champagne flutes below

- A bar in the corner replete with HUMAN KEGS - humans with
taps in their necks for fresh blood

The Wolfman chatting with the Blob Al tries to slip into
the conversation

A beat as the two monsters look down at Al They then shift
closing him out

- Al turns around to see the Creature fromthe Blue Lagoon
chatting up one of the huge brained ladies He tries to slip
into this conversation too but gets bumped out of the way
by a passing zombie

What little confidence Al had in the elevator is fading fast
He looks around for a familiar face

He sees The Mummy serving hors d’oeuveres and makes a bee
line toward him

MUMMY
(holding out a bowl of
human fingers)
Finger food

A zombie eats one of the fingers then wipes his mouth with
Mummy’s gauze

MUMMY (contd)
(meekly)
Thank you Thank you so much

AL
(re the zombie)
Can you believe these guys

MUMMY
Al Hey man - what are you doing
here
AL
(boasting)

I got invited by Dracula

MUMMY
For real

The Creature from the Blue Lagoon signals the Mummy

CREATURE
Hey you Bring me some of those
snacks

MUMMY

I’ve gotta get back to work Meet
me on the roof later - you gotta
fi11 me in

AL

Definitely

The Mummy goes off as Al stands by himself in the crowded
room

THE BAR - LATER
Al sits alone at the bar
Suddenly a voice

INVISIBLE BARTENDER
Can I help you

He looks around Where did that come from

INVISIBLE BARTENDER (cont d)
You Goblin You’re up You wanna
drink

AL
(tentatively)
Yes

Immediately a SHRUNKEN HEAD MUG floats off of the shelf
gets filled at one of the human taps and slams down in front
of Al

SHRUNKEN HEAD
OW Careful with that you
invisible freak
(noticing Al)
Aaah Since when do they let losers
hang with the popular crowd

The bartender turns the mug around so it faces away from Al
INVISIBLE BARTENDER
Don’t mind him -- it’s just the
drink talkin’

Suddenly --

DRACULA (0S)
How sad Sitting all alone at the
prom

Startled Al turns Dracula is sitting right next to him

AL
Count Dracula I was just you
know taking a break This is a
great party

DRACULA

(re the guests)
They know you don’t belong here
It’s written all over your face
Being a great monster is more than
a bite on the neck and a few
chocolate covered scabs It
requires an attitude a deep seeded
belief that you are better than
everyone else You must own it
Live it Wear it like a suit of
armor

(pointing)
Over there --

Al looks to see A WEREWOLF COUPLE standing nearby The female
sways her head back and forth lulling the male into a semi-
hypnotic state

DRACULA (cont’d)
See how she controls a more
powerful adversary

FEMALE WEREWOLF
You’ re looking very fetching this
evening

MALE WEREWOLF
Thank you baby

FEMALE WEREWOLF
So why don’t you fetch me a drink

DRACULA
Real power lies within And there --

Dracula turns Al’s attention to the Phantom in his mask

DRACULA (cont’d)
Without the mask he’s just a poor
man’s Liberace But with it - he
creates an aura of fear

(MORE)

DRACULA (cont’d)
(tapping Al’s head)
It’s all up here

Dracula’s flow is interrupted by a long loud fart Both he
and Al look over to see Frank finish off his gas

FRANKENSTEIN
(recoiling at the smell)
Whoa Who died in here

The whole group around him raises their hands Then bursts
out laughing Dracula cringes in disgust

DRACULA
The exception that proves the rule
Believe in your heart that you
belong here - and soon you will
Show me you have what it takes
Show me you deserve the gift Show
me I’m not wasting my time

Al takes a deep breath He’s gotta step up

AL MINGLES

Trying to do what Dracula told him Al works on looking like
he belongs He tries holding himself differently walking
differently projecting an air of confidence and strength

He works the room
ZOMBIE
to a Werewolf)
»8o0 I did the walk of the undead
and the humans -- I don’t know man -
- they just forgot how to run

The werewolf laughs So does Al
AL
(overly confident
That’s a good one Z

The Zombie looks over at Al But Al’s already off to another
conversation

ZOMBIE
Who was that

The werewolf shrugs

AL
(to the Phantom)
Love your work Big fan

AL (cont’d)
(to a huge brained lady)
Good to see you Thanks for coming

Al laughs with the Blob slapping him on the back and
getting his hand covered in ooze

He’s starting to get it down Faking it with confidence

As he passes the dinner table he sees Mavis slip away from
Brian and walk outside to the balcony He decides to follow
her

As he leaves we catch a moment with --

DRACULA AND FRANK

Dracula eats his bowl of soup Frank and two FRIENDS watch
him and giggle Dracula’s lips start to get puffy

DRACULA
What

They look away And giggle some more
Dracula’s head starts to swell

DRACULA (cont’d)
What What are you laughing at

He looks down at the soup
DRACULA (cont’d)
You didn’t put garlic in this did

you

Frank bursts out laughing - dropping a bottle of Liquid
Garlic from his hand

Dracula whose head is now huge plays the good sport

DRACULA (cont’d)
Ok ha ha You got me

He then turns to a skeleton waiter and pulls him close

DRACULA (cont’ d)
(full of quiet rage)
Get me my epi-pen

THE BALCONY
Al looks through the slats of the wrought-iron guard-rail
surrounding the balcony Down below he can see the pool the
spa the cemetery Off in the distance a small village
He looks over to see Mavis leaning against the railing The
moonlight highlights her eyes -- just as in the old monster
movies She looks radiant
AL
Great party huh

She glances over at him

MAVIS
(indifferent)
Stellar
A beat
AL

(re the small village)
Is that the town of Transylvania

MAVIS
In all its glory

AL
So you’re Mavis Im Al

She turns to look at him

MAVIS
Do I know you

AL
(full of false bravado)
You will I’ve got a few things
cookin’ with your dad Pretty big
stuff actually

MAVIS
You look very familiar Now I
remember You’re the bellboy I saw
you when we checked in
(seeing right through him)
Deals with my father please
AL
No it’s true I mean youre right
I work at the hotel for now - but
that’s only temporary Your dads
helping me move up

MAVIS

To what
(re his suit)

Lounge singer

AL
Hey I like this suit

MAVIS
Clearly

AL
Fine You want to be like that
I’11l just go back inside I was
only trying to be nice

MAVIS
No you weren’t You were trying to
shmooze me so I’d put in a good
word for you with my father

AL

(indignant)
I was not

Mavis raises her eyebrows “no” She then notices Brian
headed her way

MAVIS
Oh great

She looks around for a quick escape There is none
MAVIS (cont’d)
You want to impress me Find me
some place to hide

Al looks around

AL
You can fly right

MAVIS
Of course

Al immediately pushes her off the balcony

Brian arrives Hunched over and gurgling he sniffs around
looking for Mavis Al leans against the balcony trying to
act nonchalant

Brian sniffs Al as well as the railing where Mavis was
standing a moment earlier

He ultimately gives up and goes back inside
A bat flies up and transforms back into Mavis
MAVIS (cont’d)
(in disbelief)
You pushed me off the balcony
Yes I did
MAVIS
(pissed)
You pushed me off the balcony
AL
You just said that

Mavis huffs and walks back inside Al stands there
satisfied

AL (cont’d)
(calling after her)
You’ re welcome
THE EVENING’S ENTERTAINMENT

Back in the ballroom the crowd clamors for a song

WOLFMAN
Sing one for us

ZOMBIE
Come on What’s a party without
entertainment
Dracula sits at the head of the table trying to demur

DRACULA
Oh no - I couldn’t possibly

The guests starts to chant

GUESTS
Song Song Song

DRACULA
Well I -- I mean the pipes aren’t
even warmed up yet
(starting to stand)
But if my public demands

A chord plays on the piano Dracula looks behind him to see
Frankenstein sitting at the keys It becomes clear that the
crowd was actually clamoring for him

The Count embarrassed slowly sits back down as Frank leans
into the mic

FRANKENSTEIN
Thank you Thank you so much

Al re-enters and sees Mavis standing by the bar getting a
drink He glances around and spies Brian dragging around
looking for her

He makes a bee-line for the Nostferatu boy and quickly points
him in the right direction Mavis turns to see him coming
sighs then notices Al standing right behind him

Al gives her a little wave She gives him the equivalent of
“the finger”

FRANKENSTEIN (cont‘d)
(continuing his patter)
And an extra special thanks to the
Phantom for letting me tickle his
ivories

The crowd chuckles Al moves around to get a better view

FRANKENSTEIN (cont’d)
Hey -- I wasn’t being dirty Hes
the one who plays with his organ in
public

A good laugh The Phantom salutes him - acknowledging the
joke at his expense

FRANKENSTEIN (cont’ d)
Ok time to get serious

Frank plays a gentle intro signals for a spotlight to hit
him and adjusts the lit candelabra on the piano

FRANKENSTEIN (cont’ d)
(re the candles)
As long as they keep their
distance well be ok

He looks out at the crowd and begins to play in earnest -- a

beautiful slow ballad

FRANKENSTEIN (cont’d)
(singing)
IM DRIVING IN MY CAR
I TURN ON THE RADIO
IM PULLING YOU CLOSE
YOU JUST SAY NO
YOU SAY YOU DONT LIKE IT
BUT GIRL I KNOW YOURE A LIAR
‘CAUSE WHEN WE KISS - FIRE

Al watches mesmerized He looks around at the other monsters
7- all completely focussed on Frank This is definitely a

moment for the memoirs

Dracula meanwhile excuses himself quietly and slips out of

the room

FRANKENSTEIN (cont’d)
LATE AT NIGHT
IM TAKING YOU HOME
I SAY I WANNA STAY
YOU SAY YOU WANNA BE ALONE
YOU SAY YOU DONT LOVE ME
GIRL YOU CANT HIDE YOUR DESIRE
AND WHEN WE KISS -

EVERYONE
FIRE

As everyone starts to sing together Al joins in -- picking
up the words as they go He’s actually starting to feel like

part of the group

AL and EVERYONE
FIRE
YOU HAD A HOLD ON ME
RIGHT FROM THE START
A GRIP SO TIGHT
I COULDNT TEAR IT APART
MY NERVES ALL JUMPING
ACTING LIKE A FOOL
WELL YOUR KISSES THEY BURN
BUT YOUR HEART STAYS COOL

As the crowd finishes the chorus Dracula returns --

accompanied by the Divorcee Dracula walks her to the back

of the room directly in Frank’s line of vision

FRANKENSTEIN
ROMEO AND JULIET

Dracula angles a silver tray to reflect the moonlight across
her face Frank sees her

FRANKENSTEIN (cont’d)
SAMSON AND --

He stops Dracula quickly covers the tray Frank blinks a few
times Did he just see Naah

FRANKENSTEIN (cont’d)
Sorry about that
(clearing his throat)
ROMEO AND JULIET
SAMSON AND DELILAH

Another flash of the Divorcee Frank is again thrown

Al looks around trying to figure out what’s going on The
crowd starts to murmur In the back Dracula smiles smugly

DRACULA
(under his breath)
You’ re not the only one who knows
how to play a prank Frank

FRANKENSTEIN
(trying to soldier on)
BABY YOU CAN BET
THEIR LOVE THEY DIDNT DENY
YOUR WORDS SAY SPLIT

The meaning of what he’s singing begins to take hold

FRANKENSTEIN (cont’ ad)
BUT YOUR WORDS THEY LIE
‘CAUSE WHEN WE KISS -

Frank stops He grabs the candelabra from the top of the
piano and holds it up He can see the Divorcee standing
there It’s not an hallucination

He throws the candelabra onto the floor

FRANKENSTEIN (cont’ dj
- FIRE
FIRE
BURNING IN MY SOUL

Frank starts to lose it He’s overly emotional and begins to
slam on the keys of the piano The crowd starts to jitter

FRANKENSTEIN (cont’ d)
ITS OUT OF CONTROL
ITS OUT OF CONTROL

Frank breaks the keys in his fury Dracula chuckles to
himself at the display The Divorcee storms off in disgust

FRANKENSTEIN (cont’d)
Out of control Out of control

Frank smashes the piano throws the bench across the room -
shattering it against the far wall and generally melts down

The crowd now completely silent has backed away - giving
Frank a wide berth

The giant finally stops huffing and puffing surrounded by
splintered piano He looks up at the room full of staring
eyes

And then it happens

The room explodes in applause Al cheering the loudest

AL
Rock and roll

CROWD
One more time Freebird

Dracula starts to growl angrily How does he keep getting one-
upped
DRACULA’ S SUITE - LATER

The Prince of Darkness is fuming Mavis relaxes on the couch
reading the Red Cross Newsletter

DRACULA
That low-grade declasse inferior
common worthless hack

MAVIS
They’ re just harmless jokes

DRACULA
I will get him back

A KNOCK at the door Mavis looks over to her father He’s
still fuming

MAVIS
(sighing)
Don’t worry Ill get it

She gets up and checks the peep hole

MAVIS (cont’d)
It’s that goblin from the party

DRACULA
Excellent Make yourself scarce I
have some business to attend to

MAVIS
You really know him
DRACULA
Now Mavis
MAVIS

What about our moonlight flight
Wait wait - let me guess --
“later”

Dracula heads for the door He glances back at his daughter
who sighs transforms into a bat and flies out the window

Dracula opens the door

DRACULA
(to Al)
Do come in

Al enters the suite

AL
Thank you again for inviting me to
the party I really did learn a lot
and

DRACULA
(interrupting)
I have something I need you to do
for me

AL
Sure

DRACULA
I want you to keep an eye on
Frankenstein Make note of
everything he does Every place he
goes

AL
You want me to spy on him

DRACULA
No I want you to ask him out ona
date Of course I want you to spy
on him

Al shifts uncomfortably Spy

AL
I don’t think that’s allowed
Exasperated Dracula throws up his hands

DRACULA
Allowed Do you think I got to
where I am by worrying about what’s
allowed I thought you wanted to be
a vampire A real monster

AL
I do

DRACULA
Well then act like it Besides
this is all in good fun

Al pauses This is a big step for him A step to the dark
side

DRACULA (cont’d)

(growing more fierce)
Enough of this ambivalence Make
your choice Are you loyal to the
hotel and to the mediocrity from
which you come - or are you loyal
to me and the greatness I can
bestow

Al sweats It’s come to this He has to decide

AL
I’m loyal to you

Dracula drags a fingernail across his palm drawing a line of
crimson blood A wind starts to blow through the room

The Count thrusts his bloody hand towards Al

DRACULA
Then let us swear a blood oath

Al looks down at his own palm He looks up at the majestic
figure before him He strengthens his resolve and scratches
his palm trying to draw blood Nothing He scratches harder

Dracula shifts his weight waiting Al tries biting his
finger Dracula sighs and pokes Al in the head causing a
drop of blood to appear He immediately clamps his hand over
the wound

Lightning flashes Thunder booms

In a FLASH Al sees Dracula shift from human form to horrible
and fierce gargoyle He is overwhelmed by feelings of power
and doom

But then Dracula lets go and everything returns to normal
Al blinks a few times Did he really see all that or was it
just in his head f

DRACULA (cont’ d)
You work for me now Al And-if you
serve me well I will give you
everything you’ve asked for And
more

Al can’t believe it His dream is starting to come true

THE ROOFTOP

Underneath the enormous lighted sign for the Hotel
Transylvania Mummy hides out from the torrential thunder
storm Dawn is breaking but it’s hard to tell

Far below the SKELETON POOLBOYS stack the chaises and clean
up around the pool - closing it for the day

AL
Mummy
Al hurries over
MUMMY
Youre late I was starting to get’
worried
AL

Yeah sorry about that But you’re
never gonna guess what just
happened I mean this morning I was
a lowly goblin working in a dead-

end job And now Im working for
Count Draculal
(MORE)
1

AL (contd)
(realizing his faux-pas)
Oh hey -- I didn’t mean that
working in the laundry is a dead-
end job but let’s be honest -
who would you rather work with - a
towel or a legend

Mummy takes a moment for all of this to sink in

MUMMY
You’ re working for the Prince of
Darkness What are you doing for
him

AL
You know - stuff He’s teaching me
how to tap into my inner power

MUMMY
I I don’t know what to say

AL
How about “I’m happy for you Al”
A beat Mummy doesn’t say anything

AL (cont’d)
Ok How about “Cool Al That’s
awesome”

Still nothing

AL (cont’d)
How about --

MUMMY
(interrupting)
Did he say when he’s gonna --

Mummy makes little fangs with his fingers and points them at
his neck

AL
Please Mummy
(quoting Dracula)
Being a great monster is more than
a bite on the neck and a few
chocolate covered scabs I have to
earn it

MUMMY
Doing what

Al puts an arm around him
AL
Look I know you’re just looking
out for me But you’ve gotta have a
little faith I’m not going to do
anything stupid

MUMMY
Promise

Al buddy-punches Mummy on the arm

AL
Promise

Mummy starts to relax

MUMMY
Just remember what’s important

AL
I will So enough about me Whats
new with you

MUMMY
Well I’m still cursed

Al rolls his eyes

AL
Hey what’d you think of that song
Frankenstein sang

MUMMY
That was cool But he left the
place a mess

AL
(remembering)
The piano

MUMMY
I found a pedal in the chandelier

AL
No way

MUMMY
Way

And as they continue chatting we fade out

SPYING ON FRANK
The next night The sun sets as the monster day begins

The RESTAURANT Frankenstein finishes his breakfast at
“Fears” and heads outside As he exits Al slips out of the
shadows to follow him

Al’s now dressed like Dracula - hair slicked back white
shirt black pants and cape (from the Hotel T gift shop
replete with “My parents went to the Hotel T and all I got
was this lousy cape” on the back)

- Frank’s NAP Frank puts out the “Do Not Disturb” sign on
his door Moments later the sounds of his SNORING echo
through the hallway Al hangs out and waits

- The GYM A ZOMBIE slowly trudges on a treadmill going less
than a mile an hour We PULL OUT to see the SKELETON next to
him running all-out WE PULL OUT further to see the WEREWOLF
behind the skelton chasing him

The Phantom and the Headless Horseman lie side-by-side on
benches doing their chess presses We PULL BACK to see
Frankenstein lying beneath them lifting both of their
benches for his presses

Al pretends to work out on the SCARE-MASTER as he keeps an
eye on Frank

- Frank’s second NAP Al sits in the hallway waiting again
- The SPA Al watches as Frank gets another cranial massage
- Frank’s third NAP Again in the hallway

And finally Al follows Frank to --

THE POOL

It’s huge shaped like an anatomically correct heart and
filled with monsters --

The Creature from the Blue Lagoon teaches water scare-obics
to the older set A GIANT TENTACLE reaches out of the depths
and pulls unsuspecting monsters into the water -- to their
delight and glee The Wolfman family gets out of the pool and
shakes themselves off like dogs

A sign by the diving board reads “No drowning before
midnight No lifeguard on duty No harming other monsters
Rest in peace”

And of course the HOTTIES of the monster set lay about on
the chaises getting moon tans At the end of the row is none
other than Mavis - who is laying out but fully dressed

Frank does a running leap toward the pool

FRANKENSTEIN
CANNONBALL

Al dives for cover as Frank plunges into the water soaking
everyone around the pool

Al then steps out -- completely dry Mavis who is drenched
catches eyes with him Al gives her a look of mock sympathy

Then the tentacle grabs him and pulls him in

AL
Aaaaugh

Mavis bursts out laughing

Al looking a bit like a drowned rat climbs out of the pool
and heads for the towel cabana

MAVIS
Wait

Al looks back as Mavis gets up from her chaise

MAVIS (cont’d)
Wait a minute I want to talk to
you

Al ignores her and keeps walking Mavis poofs into a bat to
catch up then poofs back

AL
Let me guess I’ve somehow insulted
you by falling into the pool

MAVIS
You didn’t fall You were
(trying not to laugh)
yanked

She laughs again Al walks faster reaches the cabana and
grabs a towel Mavis hurries after him

MAVIS (cont’d)
I’m sorry Look I just wanted to
apologize for last night I was
being a brat

That’s an understatement

MAVIS
You don’t know what it’s like
having Count Dracula for a father
Never knowing why someone’s talking
to you what they want from you if
they’ re being sincere

Al looks over at her In the light of the moon she seems
almost vulnerable

MAVIS (cont’d)
Besides most creatures are scared
of me And you well you threw
me off of the 13th floor

AL
Yes I did

Mavis laughs at the memory Al does too It’s a nice shared
moment

MAVIS
So I never thought I’d say this
but

She likes him She wants to see him again
MAVIS (cont’d)

(re his new outfit)
--I miss the suit

AL
Are you kidding This look is a
classic

MAVIS

If by “classic” you mean “old”
then I agree

AL

You’ re wearing the same thing
MAVIS

Because I have to -- what’s your

excuse

AL
I have very refined taste

MAVIS
(laughing)
Oh please

Al suddenly remembers why he’s out here

AL
Shoot

He looks around trying to find Frank He’d forgotten all
about him while chatting with Mavis

He spies him at the far side of the pool slipping on his
Hawaiian shirt and parachute pants as a waiter brings over a
fruity vacation drink

MAVIS
Is everything ok

AL
Yes I was supposed to

Al stops He decides to lie

AL (cont’d)
I wanted to go by and meet
Frankenstein and I thought I’d
lost him there for a second

MAVIS
I’1ll introduce you

She takes Al by the arm and starts to lead him over
AL
No no That’s ok You really don’t
have to do this I’11l just

MAVIS
Oh please It’s my pleasure

AL
Mavis seriously

MAVIS
Frank

Frank sees them from his chaise and waves them over Al now
has no choice
MAVIS (cont’d)
Frank Id like you to meet
someone

FRANKENSTEIN
Mavis Doll
(checking out Al)
Is this the new Brian

MAVIS
Sadly I’m still stuck with the old
Brian Frank this is Al Al Frank

AL
I uh It’s a pleasure to meet
you sir

FRANKENSTEIN
Call me Frank
(to both)
Pull up a chair Have a drink

MAVIS

I can’t I’ve gotta meet father at
a tasting Tiresome events -
tastings But at least I’1l get to
spend some quality time with the
old man

(to Al)
Great seeing you again Al I hope
we get to do it again sometime

AL
Me too

An awkward moment between them It doesn’t escape Frank

Mavis goes

FRANKENSTEIN
She likes you

AL
What No She’s seriously out of my
league I mean do you really think
so

FRANKENSTEIN
I can see youre not the brains of
the family So tell me - is it true
what they say about goblins That
you can steal a wart off a witch’s
nose

AL
Uh yeah I guess
FRANKENSTEIN
Show me
AL
Now

Franks gestures for him to get on with it

AL (cont’d)
Ok Umm What time is it

Frank quickly clamps his hand over his watch He lifts it
The watch is still there

FRANKENSTEIN
Ah hah Gotcha

PULL BACK to reveal Frank sitting naked (with strategic
visual blocking) while Al hold all of his clothes in his

hands
A beat

FRANKENSTEIN (cont’d)
I love this guy

He takes his clothes back from Al and starts to get dressed

FRANKENSTEIN (cont’d)
So kid great chatting Gotta
split

AL
Oh Uh ok Where’re ‘ya going

FRANKENSTEIN
I figured I’d-head into town Do a
little scaring

Frank finishes getting dressed and turns to leave Al starts
to get nervous -- how’s he going to keep spying
AL
(quickly)
Me too

Frank looks back

FRANKENSTEIN
(not convinced)
You’ re going scaring

AL
Yeah Sure I do it all the time
FRANKENSTEIN
(shrugging)

Ok I’11 meet you out front in 20
minutes

THE FRONT OF THE HOTEL

Frank waits out front for the Headless Horseman to pull up in
his carriage

Al steps out of the hotel wearing a mask like the Phantom’s
a hairpiece like a werewolf and his gift shop cape Frank
checks him out from head to toe

FRANKENSTEIN
What are you supposed to be

AL
This is my scaring gear

FRANKENSTEIN
Well it worked Now take it off

Al pauses for a beat then does as he says

The Horseman pulls up and Frank gets in the back Al starts
to climb up top

FRANKENSTEIN (cont’d)
Where are you going

Al looks over

FRANKENSTEIN (cont d)
We ride back here kid

Things are definitely changing for Al He climbs back down
and gets in the carriage with Frank

The Horseman looks at the empty space next to him He then
reaches into his head pulls out some seeds pops them into
his mouth and flips the reins

They take off

THE BACK OF THE CARRIAGE

Frank and Al ride to the town of Transylvania

AL
Can I ask you something
FRANKENSTEIN
Sure kid
AL
How’d you become such a great
monster
FRANKENSTEIN

I didn’t have any choice The
humans too one look at me and ran
screaming

AL
(impressed)
Wow

FRANKENSTEIN
It’s not all it’s cracked up to be
Before I met my ex I was ready to
call it a day - retire

AL
Why

FRANKENSTEIN
Because I used to take it all so
seriously I never knew how to have
fun She helped me loosen up
Besides none of this means
anything if you don’t have someone
to share it with

Al looks over

AL

You still love her don’t you
FRANKENSTEIN

I’ve loved her since our very first

date
We SMASH CUT to their first date--

THE WINDMILL

Frank and the Divorcee -- looking much younger replete with
sideburns and 70’s hair -- stand atop a classic windmill
gazing into each other’s eyes

DIVORCEE
Drachma for your thoughts

FRANKENSTEIN
Womaaan gooood

DIVORCEE
(swooning)
Oh Frank
She pulls him close and they kiss
As the camera CIRCLES their embrace we see that the windmill
is in fact surrounded by ANGRY VILLAGERS They set the
windmill on fire -- creating a massive blaze around the
lovers

SMASH CUT BACK TO

THE BACK OF THE CARRIAGE
Frank lost in the memory sits in silence
FRANKENSTEIN
Man was she smokin’
AL
You should tell her how you feel
Frank looks over at Al
FRANKENSTEIN
Now you’ve got game Where was it
back with Mavis

Al blushes The carriage stops in front of the town gates

AL
(trying to change the
subject)
Hey look -- we’re here Time to go

scaring

(hopping out)
It’s a bedutiful day for it don’t
you think

Frank just shakes his head as he climbs out too

A NIGHT ON THE TOWN

Shot like a montage of old BLACK and WHITE horror films Al and
Frank go on a scaring spree through Transylvania set to Ozzy
Osbourne’s “Crazy Train”

- Frank bursts through the wall of a PUB sending the
VILLAGERS screaming into the streets

Al tries to burst through a wall at ANOTHER PUB but can
barely make a dent in it Frank finally gives him a push
sending him trough covering him in plaster and wood

- Frank carries a passed out WOMAN in his arms Al follows
dragging his passed out woman behind him

- Frank smashes a LAB shattering all the bottles and
setting it all on fire He freaks out at the fire but Al
plays a melody on a horn soothing him

- Frank and Al are bound in chains in the town square Frank
breaks out and rampages through the CROWD They follow him
leaving Al alone and chained in the now empty square

- Frank and Al approach the Frankenstein Manor They ring and
run

All in all it’s a great day as the two become friends

THE BLOOD CELLAR

Dracula stands at a counter with several IV bags full of
blood before him They have labels like “Columbus ‘92” and
“Einstein ‘84”

A WITCH BLOOD STEWARD fills a test tube from one of the bags
and hands it to the Count

BLOOD STEWARD
This is the Napoleon ‘97 Pre-
Waterloo Rare Oaky Not in the
least bit clotty

Dracula drinks swishes it around in his mouth breathes
through it and finally spits it out into a SPITTOON

DRACULA
Sublime Mavis

We PULL OUT slightly to see a less than enthusiastic Mavis
standing next to him

She takes her test tube of blood gulps it and spits it

MAVIS
(uninterested)
Outstanding

DRACULA
Brian

We PULL OUT further to see Brian Nosferatu standing next to
Mavis He has his head buried in a spittoon slurping and
gurgling He looks up at the mention of his name covered in
blood

Just then Al steps through the front door He signals to
Dracula Mavis sees him and immediately her face lights up

DRACULA (cont d)
Excuse me for a moment would you

Dracula walks over to Al and they speak in hushed tones Al
is clearly giving his report to Dracula though Mavis can’t
hear a word

She watches the two of them for a bit then looks over at
Brian -- who is now trying to stick his tongue into each test
tube to lick out the remaining blood

She grimaces then decides to join Al and her father She
catches the end of their conversation --

AL
-he’s a really great guy

DRACULA
-- who will appreciate a really
great prank Excellent work Al
(noticing his daughter)
Mavis -- is everything ok

MAVIS
I’m feeling a little bit queasy I
think I want to go up to the room

DRACULA
But they haven’t served the plasma
course And what about Brian We
can’t just leave him here alone
64

Brian is now trying to lick off a spot of blood on the end of
his nose It’s an exercise in futility

AL
(to Mavis)
Ill walk you up

(to Dracula)
That way you can stay

MAVIS
That would be nice Thank you Al

Dracula considers

DRACULA
Yes Yes that would be fine

Dracula watches as Al and Mavis leave

THE ELEVATOR
The doors close and Al presses the 13th floor
MAVIS

You know I’m not really sick I
just had to get out of there

Really
Mavis nods Al quickly presses the button for the lobby

MAVIS
What are you doing

AL
(paraphrasing Frank)
Helping you loosen up Were gonna
go do something fun

THE LOBBY

The doors to the elevator open and Al pulls Mavis out after
him

AL
If you could do anything in the
world right now what would it be

MAVIS
Umm Go fora moonlight flight

Al stops
AL
I can’t fly although I know how
to fix that

He pulls her toward the kitchen and starts to open the door
Mavis pulls back

MAVIS
I don’t think we’re allowed in
there

AL

(paraphrasing Dracula)
If I worried about what’s allowed
I wouldn’t be where I am Come on

He takes her hand and pulls her inside

THE KITCHEN

The place is teeming with WITCHES -- cooking making potions
chopping Slicing incanting

Al and Mavis sneak their way over to the rack of WITCH’S
BROOMS hanging along the far wall They slither crawl
scoot and shuffle as they avoid detection

Once there Al checks to make sure no one’s looking then --
He grabs one

A witch turns around at the last moment

WITCH
Hey

AL
Run

Al and Mavis giggling race out of the kitchen with the
broom

THE LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

They head across the lobby with the witch in close pursuit

WITCH
Stop Come back

Mavis grabs the broom and hops on it getting it to levitate

MAVIS
Come on

Al jumps on back and they immediately flip over and fall off
onto the floor

Al picks up the broom and hops on the front Mavis gets on
the back and they take off - just in the nick of time

But Al can’t control the broom at all

They ricochet around the lobby passing through the fountain
getting soaked knocking over statues buzzing guests
Skeletons dive out of the way collapsing into piles of bones
- then reforming It’s creating quite a commotion

THREE WITCHES fly out of the kitchen on brooms of their own

MAVIS (cont’d)
(seeing them)
Oh no

AL
Hang on

Al dives down and heads straight for the kitchen door

MAVIS and AL
Aaaaaah

They slam through witches close behind TWO WITCHES make it
in after them - the other catching the door on the back-swing
and getting knocked senseless

The CRASH and CLANG of disaster in the kitchen echoes through
the lobby

Mummy steps out from the Employee’s Only area to see what is
going on

A beat Then Al and Mavis crash back through the kitchen door
and into the lobby once again Mummy sees Al - what on earth
is he doing

Only ONE WITCH flies through after them The other one
stumbles out of the kitchen a moment later battered and
bruised with her broom in splinters

Al and Mavis sides-swipe a row of candelabras - knocking them
over - as they aim for the front door

A large BLOB is walking in from the outside

Al leans down over the broom Mavis leans down on top of him -
- making their profile as small as possible

The blob fills almost the entire doorway

Al angles quickly barely slipping by the creature and out to
freedom

The witch isn’t so lucky She slams right into the blob and
gets stopped short -- like a fly stuck in Jello

The Mummy looks at the trashed lobby stunned

OUTSIDE

Al pulls up into the moonlit star-filled sky and finally
slows down

Both of them are windswept and a mess Mavis’ usual slicked-
back hair is full-bodied and teased Her collar is open and
her Gothic makeup mostly wiped off

MAVIS
That was the most fun I think I’ve
ever had

She’s no longer the carefully quaffed buttoned up royal
she’s always been She is giddy and excited and radiant Al
can’t take his eyes off of her

MAVIS (cont’d)
(a little self-conscious)
What
AL
Nothing You just look really
good like this
Another awkward moment then Al holds out a clenched hand

AL (cont’d)
I got you something

He opens it to reveal a stunning ruby and gold pendant
MAVIS
It’s It’s beautiful It’s
Wait a minute

She reaches up to her collar where her pendant usually sits

MAVIS (cont’d)
It’s mine When did you take that

AL
Just a second ago

She laughs

MAVIS
Al you are something else

AL
Yes I am

They soar high above the clouds silhouetted against the
moon

AL (cont’d)
Hold on

Al steers them into several arcing loops Mavis laughs the
entire way She’s having the time of her life

LATER they sail above the forest letting their feet brush
along the treetops

AL (cont’d)
Can I ask you something
MAVIS
Sure
AL

Why do you hang out with Brian if
you don’t like him

MAVIS
It’s the Dracula credo - “friends
in public foes in private”
Besides I figure if I go out with
someone my father likes it’1l be
one less thing we fight about

AL
Your father likes me

MAVIS
I’ve noticed

An uncomfortable moment

MAVIS (cont’d)
So tell me about you

AL
What do you want to know

MAVIS
Where were you born What’s your
favorite color What do you want to
be when you grow up You know the
basics

Al laughs

AL
Ok let’s see To answer your
questions in order Goblintown
green and a monster legend like
your father

MAVIS
You’ re not egotistical enough to be
like my father

AL
Sure I am

Al clears his throat then sings a musical warm up

AL (cont’d)
ME ME ME ME ME ME ME

Mavis laughs

AL (cont’d)
Hey I wanna show you something

Al turns the broom around and aims for a hilltop nearby

ALS FAVORITE PLACE

Al and Mavis stand on a hilltop with a mighty OAK growing on
the peak

AL
This is my favorite place

Al climbs up the tree to a large branch Mavis follows
MAVIS

I haven’t climbed a tree in
forever

AL
I climb this one every week
‘70

MAVIS
Why

She reaches the limb and sits next to him

AL
Because of that

» He points the Hotel Transylvania glimmers way off in the
distance
MAVIS
Wow It’s beautiful from here

AL
It’s beautiful from everywhere

Al reaches over and holds Mavis’ hand They sit and enjoy
this closeness for a few moments

AL (cont’d)
When I was little I used to watch
my dad go out goblinning He would
work all night stealing human’s
pens reading glasses hubcaps
He’s hide their remotes and set off
their alarms It was back-breaking
work -- and what did it get him
Was he honored by monster society
Did they even know his name No
Because goblins aren’t even on
their radar We’re just little
pests who scurry about in the
shadows

Al looks at the hotel

AL (cont’d)
I came up here every week and I
swore to myself that what I was
would never hold me back Some day
I would belong there Some day they
would definitely know my name

Mavis looks over at Al

MAVIS
I wish I was brave enough to do
that Be who I wanted to be Follow
my dream

AL
What’s holding you back

Mavis sighs So many things

The slightest tinge of purple colors the horizon as the sun
makes it’s eventual journey towards dawn

MAVIS
I have to go
AL
Just a few more minutes
MAVIS
In a few more minutes I1l be a
pile of ash
AL
(realizing)

You’ ve never seen a sunrise have
you

MAVIS
(getting up)

Nope And I’m not going to chance
one now

AL

When can I see you again

MAVIS

How about tomorrow night At the
hotel belfry I’11 show you my
favorite place

Al hops down

from the tree and grabs the broom

AL

It wouldn’t be proper to let such a
beautiful lady fly back by herself

Mavis smiles

as Al flies up to get her

OUTSIDE THE HOTEL GATES - LATER

Al waits for
carriage He
night of his

The carriage
out

the Headless Horseman to pull up in his
is walking on air - having just had the best
life

stops and the back door opens Frankenstein gets

FRANKENSTEIN

Al Hey kid

AL
Hey Frank

FRANKENSTEIN
So you inspired me today

aL
I did
Franks holds up a beautifully wrapped present

FRANKENSTEIN
I’m gonna get her back

AL
Cool

FRANKENSTEIN
A piece of advice though -- it’s
easier if you don’t lose ‘em in the
first place
The gates open as Frank wanders inside
FRANKENSTEIN (cont’d)
Catch ‘ya later kid
AL
Good night Frank

Al looks up at the Headless Horseman - who scoots over to
make room for the goblin

But Al climbs in the back

DRACULAS SUITE

Mavis quietly tiptoes out of the bathroom in her daygown and
climbs into her coffin

She is about to close the lid when --

DRACULA
(from his coffin)
Where have you been

MAVIS
Just flying around with Al

DRACULA
I don’t want you seeing him any
more

MAVIS
Why not

DRACULA
Because I said so

A beat Mavis grows angrier and angrier From overhead we can
see both vampires in their separate coffins -- so close yet
worlds apart

MAVIS
You know I’m not a child anymore

DRACULA
He’s not one of us We are
Draculas Mavis and we have a
certain image to uphold

MAVIS
(interrupting)
You mean you have a certain image
to uphold I hate all that stuff
The blood tastings and the parties
and the false friends I just want
to be myself

DRACULA
Take my advice -- stay away from
the goblin He’s not who you think

he is

Mavis angry and frustrated grunts and slams her coffin
shut Dracula stares at the ceiling for a moment or two

DRACULA (cont d)
That went well

He turns to his side reaches up and closes his coffin too

THE DARK FOREST - THE NEXT EVENING

The sun sets over the forest making the trees appear more
and more sinister The wind picks up creating an eerie
whistling sound

Deep within the woods a light flickers inside a massive
REDWOOD casting creepy shadows on the surrounding rocks and
plants

Inside the trunk of the tree a round room has been carved
out of the wood The flickering light comes from a small
lantern which hangs by a straw bed
74

On the bed is none other than Al sleeping away peacefully

A long shadow slowly crosses the bed It grows larger and
larger It’s a man No It’s Count Dracula

He watches the goblin sleep for a moment sinister and
malevolent Finally --

DRACULA
Al

Al shifts in his bed

DRACULA (cont’ d)
Al

Al slowly opens his eyes He sees the Count and immediately
bolts up

AL
Count Dracula

DRACULA
So sorry to intrude but I’ve come
up with the most brilliant
practical joke - and I need your
help

AL
Practical joke

DRACULA
Yes To play on Frankenstein
(almost giddy)
This one is a masterpiece

Al gets out of bed and wipes the sleep from his eyes

AL
What do I have to do

DRACULA
I want you to sneak into
Frankenstein’s room during one of
his many naps and steal his brain
Then --

Dracula laughs - this is going to be hilarious

DRACULA (cont’d)
I’1l bring him and his bed up to
the roof

(MORE)

DRACULA (cont’d)
Well slip his brain back in and
he’1l have no idea how he got
there

Dracula laughs even harder Al doesn’t really get it

DRACULA (cont’ d)
What You don’t think it’s funny

AL
No no It’s hysterical Really

DRACULA
Excellent You know Al when we
first met I wasn’t sure you would
stay the course But you’ve
displayed your loyalty time and
time again And that’s what I look
for in a vampire

Dracula reaches into his pocket and pulls out a skeleton key
He tosses it to Al

DRACULA (cont’ d)

If you’re going to be one of us
you should live like one of us

Al looks at the key

AL
My own suite
DRACULA
Tonight Al your dream comes true

Tonight you will become a true
monster great

THE HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA

Al stands before the closed gates of the Hotel Transylvania --
just like he did at the start of the movie

Only this time he reaches into his pocket and holds up his
room key -- and the gates swing wide for him

Al steps through having finally arrived

THE LOBBY

Al full of confidence steps inside - twirling his room key
for all to see

The hotel employees including the Mummy are still cleaning
up the mess Al and Mavis made the night before

They all notice Al glare at him then look away He is
goblin-non-grata

Al heads over to the Mummy who is mopping the floor with his
gauze

AL
Mumster What’s going on buddy

MUMMY
(supressing his anger)
A small mishap sir But the staff
is taking care of it

Al looks around noticing the mess for the first time

AL
Oh yeah hey - sorry about that

MUMMY
Not a problem sir

AL
Whats with the “sir”

MUMMY
It’s the way we always talk to
guests sir
Hyde walks past

HYDE
You missed a spot ‘ya lint ball

Hyde turns back to Jeckyll
JECKYLL
(nodding)
Al
Al follows Mummy to the missed spot

AL
Hey Mummy - it’s me

Mummy looks away

AL (cont’d)
Look why don’t you come up to my
suite later and I’1l make it up to
you

MUMMY
I’m not allowed in the guest’s
rooms sir

Al takes a beat
AL
Oh I get it I see what’s going on

here You know you’ve been trying
- to talk me out of my dream from day

one
MUMMY
Don’t be ridiculous
AL
You’ re not cursed -- you’re just

afraid You’re afraid to stand up
for yourself you’re afraid to take
your shot and youre afraid your
friends will be more successful
that you ever were

Stung Mummy backs away

AL (contd)
Truth hurts doesn’t it

Mummy turns his back and hurries off

AL (cont’ d)
(calling after him)
That’s right Run away like you
always do

AL’S SUITE

Al opens the door to his very own suite It should be a
triumphant moment but the truth is it’s kind of empty

Al checks out the room A coffin in the middle A mini-bar
with Blood Blood Light and Fresca Towels with the Hotel T
monogram in the middle

Al steps out onto the balcony and looks out He sees the
Divorcee standing on her balcony across the way She holds a
SNOW GLOBE in her hands and is deep in thought

She shakes the globe -- and we see that it contains a scene
of the burning windmill from her first date with Frank

AL
Oh no

THE BELFRY

Al hurries up the winding stairs to the belfry of the hotel
Half way up he runs into Mavis - heading down

MAVIS

There you are I thought something
had happened to you

AL
No no - I’m ok I just

MAVIS
(grabbing his hand)
Well come on -- I want to show you
something

Al pulls back stopping her

AL
Mavis listen -- something’s come
up Something I have to do

MAVIS
Can’t it wait
AL
No But don’t worry Well have
plenty of time We’1l1 hang out in
the belfry later
Mavis’ face darkens

MAVIS
Later

AL
Yeah Tomorrow Or the next day

MAVIS
Did my father talk to you

AL
We spoke this morning why

Mavis starts to back away from Al

MAVIS
Cancel your plans Come to the
belfry with me

AL
I can’t
MAVIS
You can’t Or you won’t
AL
I can’t I have something important

to do
Mavis slowly starts to nod

MAVIS
Right Of course One has to have
priorities doesn’t one

AL
Exactly

Mavis backs up the stairs

MAVIS
(bitter)
You really do want to be just like
him don’t you

She turns and hurries up the stairs Al stands there confused
- unsure of what just happened He checks his watch -- he’s
gotta get moving

STEALING THE BRAIN

Al uses the secret passages of the hotel to sneak into
Frankenstein’s room

Once there he finds Frank taking his afternoon nap -- hooked
up to classic Frankenstein equipment -- metal bowl on his
head with electrodes running to a huge console sparking
machine etc

In a comic sequence Al tries to get the bowl off Frank’s
head not break anything not get electrocuted and get his
brain -- all without waking him up

He finally succeeds puts the brain in a glass jar and slips
back out

THE ROOF - LATER

Al steps out onto the roof of the Hotel Transylvania It is
dark and shadowy The only sound - the din of the guests by
the pool many stories below

The goblin makes his way around the various chimneys fans
vents and other rooftop appliances looking for the Prince of
Darkness

Silhouetted against the ledge is a large man Al squints
It’s Frankenstein

DRACULA (0S)
Without his brain it was easy to
bring him up here

Al turns to see Dracula heading his way

AL
Where’s his bed

DRACULA
I came up with a better idea Did
you bring it

Al holds out the jar with the brain

DRACULA (cont’d)
Excellent Would you do the honors

Al walks over to Frank puts down the jar and tries to
unscrew the monster’s head It’s stuck

DRACULA (cont d)
Give it a little elbow grease

Al climbs onto Frank’s shoulders and wraps his arms around
his head to get better leverage He grunts as he tries to
open it

Dracula meanwhile surreptitiously knocks a small rock off
of the roof -- causing it to fall to the pool deck below It
hits with a clatter causing all of the guests to look up to
see where it came from

From poolside it looks like Al and Frank are wrestling

CREATURE
What’s going on up there

WOLFMAN
Is that Frank

On the roof Al finally gets the skull open He looks inside

AL
There’s something in here

Al reaches in and pulls out a clump of ramen noodles

AL (cont’d)
Are these noodles Is this part of
the joke

Dracula smilesa wide and frightening grin

DRACULA
Congratulations Al
AL
For what
DRACULA
You have fulfilled your dream
AL
I have
DRACULA

You are now officially a true and
indisputable monster great A
legend You my friend are the
monster who killed Frankenstein

Before Al can fully digest this Dracula grabs the jar with
the brain and pushes Frank and Al over the edge of the

building

THE POOL

Al splashes into the pool while Frank hits the pavement
splattering noodles all over the place

EVERYONE screams Pandemonium Monsters running every which
way And then --

HUGE BRAINED LADY
(pointing at Al)
That’s him That goblin did it He
pushed Frankenstein off the roof
The crowd shifts its focus to-the little green creature
climbing out of the pool

AL
No Wait It was just a prank

The angry mob starts to close in around Al

AL (cont’d)
Seriously Ask Dracula

WOLFMAN
Dracula’s his friend He’d never
hurt him
The Divorcee runs over and kneels by Frank’s body

DIVORCEE
His brain It’s ruined

AL
No it’s not

Al scoops up some noodles A collective gasp

AL (contd)
They’ re just noodles

He eats some to make his point Several monsters faint
CROWD
Oh my god He ate Frank’s brain
Get him Get the goblin

And the crowd converges It’s a free-for-all

Al slips out of the pile and runs off terrified

CHASED WITH PITCHFORKS

Just like in every classic monster movie the angry mob

chases the monster with pitchforks and torches Only in this
case the angry mob are the monsters and the monster is Al

Hyde leads the group as they chase Al past the cemetery Past
Transylvania Past the swamp Into the Dark Forest And at

that point Al manages to lose them

HYDE
He has to come out some time And
when he does

Hyde grabs a nearby pinecone and crushes it with one hand

FADE TO BLACK

DRACULA’S SUITE

Dracula and the Divorcee sit together mourning the loss of
Frankenstein

DIVORCEE
It’s just so hard to believe he’s
gone
DRACULA
(consoling)
I know I know
DIVORCEB
We still loved each other you
know
DRACULA
I know
DIVORCEB
I suppose I could find him a new
brain

(breaking down)
-but he wouldn’t be the same

DRACULA
It’s a real tragedy

The Divorcee collects herself and makes some hard decisions

DIVORCES
He should be accorded a full state
funeral We’1ll set it up at the
hotel cemetery Everyone will be
invited

DRACULA
I will take care of everything

DIVORCEE
And in a fitting tribute to his
greatest accomplishment we will
burn him atop a funeral pyre --
showing that he has once and for
all overcome his fear of fire
84

DRACULA
Fitting yes

She reaches out and takes the Count’s hands in her own

DIVORCEE
And Count I would like you to
deliver the eulogy

DRACULA
Me

DIVORCEE
He would have wanted you to You
know he always admired you

DRACULA
He did

DIVORCEE
He said you were a class act

Dracula bows humbly
DRACULA

I would be honored to memorialize
such a noble monster

DIVORCEE
Thank you
The Divorcee gets up to leave She turns to Dracula one last
time and gives him a huge bear hug -- just like Frank used to
do She puts him back down rumpled and askew -- then leaves

Dracula grumbles to himself as he tries to straighten his
clothes

Just then a poof of smoke and Mavis appears

DRACULA
(without even turning
around)
It’s not polite to eavesdrop

MAVIS
I know what you’re up to

DRACULA
And what is that pray tell

Dracula starts to take his clothing out of the hotel armoire
and fold them for packing

MAVIS
(detailing her clues)

You suddenly take an interest in a
‘goblin bellboy from the hotel You
decide to mentor him yet warn me

to stay away

DRACULA
And a good thing I did He turned
out to be quite a bad egg

MAVIS

(continuing)
The goblin meanwhile ends up
having a very public fight with
your secret enemy Frankenstein And
here’s the part that gives you away

o the little sweet caring

Goblin kills the giant I’11 wager
he had a little assistance

Dracula stops folding

DRACULA
How dare you accuse me of such
treachery

MAVIS

How dare you sacrifice someone I
care about your own selfish
desires

DRACULA
Oh please You’ve only known him
for a ‘few days

MAVIS
I’m talking about Frankenstein

Dracula spreads his cape in a frightening and threatening
pose

DRACULA
Remember who you are Mavis And
where your loyalties lie

MAVIS
I will

Mavis turns and storms out

AL’S FAVORITE PLACE

Al sits in the tree high on the hilltop looking at the
Hotel in the distance He is depressed and frightened and
unsure of what to do next

MAVIS (0S)
So how does it feel to be a monster
legend
Al spins around sees Mavis on the branch behind him and
quickly backs away

AL
I didn’t do it I swear

MAVIS
Everyone saw you push him off the
roof Al

AL

I know it looked like that - but
it’s not what happened Please -
you have to believe me

MAVIS
No I don’t You’re only out for
yourself -- and you don’t care who

you hurt along the way

Al slowly nods He hates what he’s become
AL
Youre right I’ve been a complete
and utter jerk I’ve lied I’ve
stolen and I’ve betrayed my
friends

Al puts out his hands -- like he was ready to be hand-cuffed

AL (cont’d)
Take me back I deserve whatever I
get
Mavis looks away
MAVIS

While that’s tempting that’s not
why I’m here

AL
It’s not
MAVIS
No I’m here because you know how
my father pulled this off
(waving off Al’s reaction)

Yes yes - I know it was him
There has to be some way to save
Frank -- and unfortunately you may

hold the key
Al’s face falls

AL
I doubt it

MAVIS
Tell me exactly what you did

AL
I snuck into Frank’s room while he
was sleeping and stole his brain I
took it up to the roof where your
dad and I were supposed to put it
back in his head --

MAVIS
What kind of prank is that

AL
I know - it’s really not funny
Anyway instead of finishing the
joke your father pushed Frank and
me off the roof

Mavis slumps down depressed
MAVIS
(finishing the story)
Splashing you into the pool and

splattering Frank’s brain all over
the pool deck

AL
No

Mavis looks up

MAVIS
What do you mean

I mean your dad took the brain The
stuff all over the pool deck was
noodles Ramen I think

Mavis’ face brightens
MAVIS
Of course he kept the brain It’s
his greatest triumph

AL
I’m sure he’s destroyed it by now

MAVIS
You don’t know him He keeps
trophies from all his great
conquests He’d never get rid of
it I have to go
She turns to leave

AL
I’m going with you

MAVIS
I don’t think so

AL
I’ve gotta set things right Mavis

She ignores him
AL (cont’d)
And you’re gonna need as many eyes
looking for that brain as you can
come up with
Mavis stops He has a point
MAVIS
Fine But you’re still a jerk
THE LAUNDRY
CLOSE ON Mummy shaking his head adamantly

MUMMY
No

Al tries to convince his old pal as Mavis stands nearby

AL
Please We need your help

MUMMY
You said I was afraid and never
stand up for myself Well meet the
new Mummy

Mummy turns his back on Al and orders the sheets around with
authority Al notices that Mummy wears a red sock dangling
from a string around his neck

AL
Look I’m sorry You were right
and I was wrong But don’t penalize
Frank because I was an idiot

Mummy shakes his head

MUMMY
You wanted to be a part of their
group - well these are the kinds of
things that they do

MAVIS
Let’s go Al We’re wasting time

AL
(to Mummy)
You once told me to remember what
was important Well what’s more
important than doing the right
thing

As Mummy considers we CUT TO

THE FUNERAL

In the middle of the hotel cemetery Frankenstein’s oversized
casket is angled open over an unlit funeral pyre Every
monster known to man crowds around it to get a last look at
the playful giant

Dracula and the Divorcee sit on folding chairs set up ona
platform by the coffin Next to Dracula is an empty seat with
a sign attached “Reserved for M Dracula” A piano sits
behind them The Werewolf stands at the podium nearby

WOLEMAN
(into the microphone)
We begin this solemn ceremony with
a few words from Frankenstein’s
life-long love

The Divorcee walks to the podium

DIVORCEE

I loved Frank I loved him since
the first time he slipped a whoopie
cushion under my seat And even
though he wasn’t always the most
expressive monster seeing you all
here today - I now realize that his
heart was as big as his

AL MAVIS and MUMMY
ride up the elevator towards the 13th floor
MUMMY
Just because I’m helping you
doesn’t mean you’re off the hook

AL
I know

They ride in silence fora beat

MUMMY
What if the brain’s not in his
suite
AL

Let’s just hope it is

DING The elevator doors open and the three get out The
instant they do --

HYDE
(from down the hall)
You
AL
Oh hell

(to Mavis and Mummy)
You two go to the suite I’1l keep
him distracted

Al takes off running Mavis holds out her room key to Mummy

MAVIS
You go to the room Ill help Al
MUMMY
(refusing the key)
No I’1l do it

Mummy takes off after Al

Hyde thunders by Mavis as she turns and heads in the opposite
direction

Meanwhile

BACK AT THE FUNERAL

The Divorcee finishes up as Dracula looks at his program It
reads “Wolfman’s Intro Divorcee’s Remarks Phantom and
Slide Show Dracula’s Eulogy Cremation”

DIVORCEE (0S)
-you never know how much you love
someone until they are gone

Dracula looks at the empty seat next to him - the
appropriateness of the comment doesn’t escape him

The Divorcee sits back down as the Wolfman re-takes the
podium

WOLFMAN
Frank was known as many things a
giant a prankster a master of the
scare But to those of us who knew
him well one passion stood out
above all others his music And
now as the Phantom plays his
favorite song I ask you to turn
your attention to the side of the
hotel where we will be projecting a
short retrospective on the rich
life that was Frankenstein’s

The Phantom begins to play Everyone joins inand sings with
him

ALL
IM DRIVING IN MY CAR
I TURN ON THE RADIO
IM PULLING YOU CLOSE
YOU JUST SAY NO
YOU SAY YOU DONT LIKE IT
BUT GIRL I KNOW YOURE A LIAR
CAUSE WHEN WE KISS - FIRE

As the song continues the slide show begins The monsters
angle to see photos of

- Frank with HERR DOCTOR - first coming to life

- Frank with the little GIRL over the well -- giving the
camera a thumbs up

- Frank carrying his bride into the bridal suite -- having
broken the wall on either side of the doorway as he crashed
her through

Meanwhile

AL AND MUMMY

turn the corner and race down the hallway with Hyde in close
pursuit They turn another corner and find themselves at a
dead end

Hyde follows sees that he has them and slows down

HYDE
Well well well -- if it isn’t the
two losers together again Im
going to enjoy killing both of you

AL
Mummy has nothing to do with this

HYDE
Like I care
(to Mummy)
Youve always been a spineless
good for nothing stupid waste of
space I should’ve unravelled you
long ago

The Mummy starts to growl to himself Hyde draws closer and
closer

AL
(to Mummy)

Ok - when I say go we each run in

a different direction He can’t

catch both of us

MUMMY
No
AL
It’s our only chance
MUMMY
(stronger)

No

AL
Mummy --

MUMMY
(exploding)
NO I will not be treated this way
any more

Hyde stops Mummy starts to grow in size A wind whips up in
the hallway Mummy’s eyes start to glow

MUMMY (cont’ d)
I am king of the Pharoahs And you
will show me some respect

Hyde cracks his neck

HYDE
How ‘bout I show you my fist

And with that Hyde rears back to take a swing Without
missing a beat the Mummy opens his mouth and sprays out a
swarm of bees -- that circle Hyde and sting him Hyde freaks
out

The Mummy grabs Hyde by the neck and starts to choke him
Hyde uses all his strength to break free but can’t

MUMMY
You’re a bully and a pest and you
need to learn some manners

Suddenly Hyde starts to transform back into Jeckyll Once he
does his head slips through Mummy’s grasp -- and the little
man screams and scurries away

Mummy returns to normal size Al stares at him

MUMMY (cont’d)
What

AL
Nothing

BACK AT THE FUNERAL
The slide show and the song come to an end

ALL

- FIRE

FIRB

BURNING IN MY SOUL
(MORE)
94

ALL (contd)
ITS OUT OF CONTROL
ITS OUT OF CONTROL

WOLFMAN
And now we turn to Frankenstein’s
friend and confidante for a few
final words about our fallen
‘comrade Count Vladimir Dracula

Dracula stands and walks to the podium leaving his program
behind We CLOSE IN again on the program as he speaks
reminding us that after the eulogy comes “cremation”

DRACULA (0S)
Thank you Wolfman This has been a
difficult night for all of us - so
I will be brief

AL MAVIS AND MUMMY

stand in the middle of Dracula’s suite They’ve torn the
place apart

AL
It’s gotta be here

MAVIS
We’ve looked everywhere

MUMMY
Maybe he has it with him

-MAVIS
Not a chance He’d never risk being
discovered with it
A beat Al has an epiphany
AL

to Mavis)
Youre absolutely right

AL’S SUITE

Al Mavis and Mummy hurry into Al’s suite They quickly
scatter and check the coffin armoire bathroom under the
sofa and the balcony

They meet back in the middle of the room

MUMMY
Nothing

MAVIS
Nothing
AL
Nothing
A beat
AL (cont’d)
A brain where would you keep a
brain

He scans the room again stopping on the mini-bar He races
over opens it and pushes aside the drinks There in the
back sits the jar with Frankenstein’s brain

BACK AT THE FUNERAL
Dracula finishes up his eulogy

DRACULA
and now my friends it is time
to bid farewell to one of the all-
time monster greats

Al Mummy and Mavis race out of the hotel towards the
cemetery Al pushes into the crowd trying to reach the
casket in time

Dracula grabs a lit torch and steps off the platform He
walks over to the unlit pyre

Al meanwhile works to get through - stepping through some
monsters’ legs pushing others out of the way He can see the
casket Just a few more steps

He sees Dracula bring the lit torch down onto the pyre
SLO-MO starts as Al dives

AL
No --

But mid-dive his feet nick a tombstone -- returning to
REGULAR MOTION we see Al to flip head over heels and land
inside the coffin - just as the lid snaps shut

The pyre bursts into flame

INSIDE THE CASKET

The only light comes from the flicker of flames through the
seams of the coffin

Al tries to pop open the lid but it’s locked tight It’s
starting to get hot Al knows he’s in one heck of a tight
spot

He works his way up to Frank’s head and maneuvers to unscrew
it He put the brain back in causing Frank to snap awake

FRANKENSTEIN
(seeing him)
Al
Frank looks around at their situation

FRANKENSTEIN (cont’ d)
We must’ve had one helluva night

Smoke starts to seem into the coffin
FRANKENSTEIN (cont’d)
Is that smoke
(starting to panic)
Are we on fire
Al grabs Frank by the collar and slaps him --
AL
Get a hold of yourself This is no
time to freak out
But Frank can’t help himself Then Al remembers their day in

Transylvania and starts humming the melody that he played on
the horn Frank starts to chill

OUTSIDE THE COFFIN

Dracula stands back smiling to himself Then --

-- the COFFIN SHATTERS into a million pieces Frank stands in
the midst of the fire burning embers reigning down around
him

He points dramatically at Dracula

FRANKENSTEIN
It was you

Dracula almost wets himself

DRACULA
Aaaaugh
Frankenstein stumbles out of the fire -- staggering like a
drunken sailor
FRANKENSTEIN

You killed me You

DRACULA
(backing away)
No No - it was the goblin

FRANKENSTEIN

you
DRACULA

This isn’t possible You’re dead
FRANKENSTEIN

I’m alive ALIVE

DRACULA

‘ You can’t be YOUR BRAIN IS IN AL’S

MINI-BAR
The crowd gasps Frank freezes All eyes turn to Dracula

DRACULA (cont’d)
I mean

Dracula turns to run but is blocked by the surrounding
crowd They start to murmur

ALL
Oh my god - did you hear what he
said He killed Frank Let’s get
him Yeah let’s teach him a lesson
once and for all

A voice from the podium --
AL
(into the microphone)
Stop
The crowd pauses and looks at the little goblin

AL (cont’d) —
There’s no killing at the Hotel T
ZOMBIE

But he broke the truce
BLOB

Yeah
AL

That doesn’t make it ok

Dracula lunges for Al Mummy steps out of the crowd and
stops him holding him in a half-nelson

DRACULA
How could you betray me like this
After all I did for you I made you
a legend Now you’1l be nothing

AL
I would rather be nothing than all
alone at the top -- like you

DRACULA
Alone Please Wolfman -- youre
with me right
WOLFMAN
(shaking his head)
You stole my room My kids had to
sleep on the couch
Dracula shrugs it of then turns to the Divorcee

DRACULA
Divorcee --

She steps over to Frank and grabs his arm tightly

DRACULA (cont’ d)
Creature Phantom

He looks for a friendly face Finally --

DRACULA (cont’d)
Mavis

Mavis slowly steps out of the crowd toward her father

DRACULA (cont’ d)
Mavis tell them

MAVIS
Tell them what What a caring

father you are
(MORE)

MAVIS (contd)
How you’re always there for me How
you always put my happiness first

’ The crowd starts to grumble again Dracula looks pleadingly
at Mavis

MAVIS (cont’d)
But none of that really matters
Because at the end of the day
Frank is alive My father didn’t
kill anybody -

The truth of what she said slowly sinks in

HUGE BRAINED LADY
But he tried to

ZOMBIE
He should be punished
CROWD
Yeah
WOLFMAN
Let’s ask Frank
CREATURE
Yeah Frank should get to decide
All eyes turn to Frank -- who is making out with his ex-wife
Someone has to tap him on the shoulder to split them up
FRANKENSTEIN
Sorry I was just uh What was

the question

WOLFMAN
Dracula just tried to kill you
What should we do with him

FRANKENSTEIN
Well if he hadn’t tried to kill
me
(re the Divorcee)
-I never would’ve gotten the love
of my life back
(directly to her)
Mmmmm Womaaan

DIVORCEB
Oh Frank

FRANKENSTEIN
(to the crowd)
And besides -- what’s a little
attempted murder between friends

The crowd laughs Frank holds his arms out to Dracula for a
hug Mummy lets him go but he doesn’t move

FRANKENSTEIN (cont’d)
(coaxing)
Come on

Dracula forces himself to walk over and Frank immediately
grabs him in a huge bear hug

Everyone CHEERS

FRANKENSTEIN (cont’d)
Hey gang - let’s not waste a
perfectly good bonfire Hit it
Phantom

The Phantom starts playing a rocked out version of “Fire” --
and Frank starts to boogie Everyone else joins in and starts
to get down

Mavis and Al look into each other’s eyes across the crowd Al
crosses to her

AL
Can you ever forgive me

MAVIS
What’ re you offering

AL
Umm I’11 hang with you in the
belfry whenever you want

MAVIS
Not good enough

AL
Ok How about I’11 never try to be
anyone other than me - ever again

MAVIS
Getting closer What else

Al thinks Suddenly the goblin finds himself being lifted
onto Frank’s shoulders

FRANKENSTEIN
Everybody give it up for the guy
who pulled the greatest prank in
the history of the Hotel T

The crowd cheers
FRANKENSTEIN (cont’d)
I don’t know about you guys but I

expect to see this goblin planning
vacation week every year

Everyone applauds and howls

ALL
Speech Speech Speech

The crowd quiets
AL
I’d love to give a speech
(looking right at Mavis)
-but I’ve got something really
important to attend to

Al climbs down from Frank’s shoulders and heads back to
Mavis

AL (cont’d)
I know just what to give you
Meet me upstairs in an hour
Frank smiles at Al then turns to the group

FRANKENSTEIN
Party on

The music starts again as we PULL UP and OUT

EPILOGUE

The beginnings of dawn Vacation week is over We see a few
quick scenes

- The Huge Brained Ladies loading up the carriage to go home

HUGE BRAINED LADY
That was the best vacation ever

HUGE BRAINED FRIEND
You know I knew it was Dracula the
whole time

HUGE BRAINED LADY
Sure you did

- Jeckyll and Hyde wrestles with the laundry down in the sub
basement - getting abused and tormented

A MRS ROBINSON (the Graduate) shot through the Divorcee’s
leg of Frank down on one knee PULL BACK to see that the leg
is not attached to the Divorcee at all but rather it’s a
spare She’s sits next to kneeling Frank

FRANKENSTEIN
(opening a jewelry box)
Mmmmmarriage goooood

In the box is a finger with an engagement ring already on it
Frank pulls off the Divorcee’s finger and replaces it with
the new one

- Mummy full of confidence once again has his bags packed
and climbs onto the Headless Horseman’s coach

MUMMY
Take me to Cairo I have some
unfinished business to attend to

- And finally --

Al leads a blind-folded Mavis - who is now dressed in a
pretty sun dress with her hair blown out - to the 13th floor
ballroom He seats her in a chair in the middle of the room

AL
Ok you ready

MAVIS
Yes

AL

This is the best thing I could
think of to give you

He pulls off the blindfold revealing what looks like the
horizon on the far wall -- only it’s made up of ghost sheets
flittering and floating looking like the sky and clouds

MAVIS
What is it

AL
Patience -

The door opens and Dracula runs in

DRACULA
Am-I too late

AL
Just in time

He stands behind his daughter hands on her shoulders
AL (cont’d)
(calling out)
Now
Several witches stand behind the linens stirring up a
bubbling pot They add one last ingredient - which creates a
FIREBALL that bursts up into the air
From Mavis’ perspective it looks like a sunrise

MAVIS
Oh Al It’s beautiful

Al takes her hand in his as we --

FADE TO BLACK
