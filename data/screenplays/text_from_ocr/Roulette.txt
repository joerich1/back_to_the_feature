ROULETTE

by
Ian Shorr and Peter Gamble Robinson

First Draft - 111207
The deepest defeat suffered by human beings is constituted by the

difference between what one was capable of becoming and what one
-Ashley Montagu

has in fact become

Guns fun weed and speed The only three things Ill ever need
-Tommy Watts lead singer of Restraining Order
FADE IN

At first its all a blur A spinning rush of red and black
As we pull away the object becomes a ROULETTE WHEEL

DAVID EASTWICK (V0)
Albert Einstein once said You
cannot beat a roulette table unless
you steal money from it

The BALL gets tossed in and with a WHOOSH we chase after it
Zooming around the wooden surface like a race car on a track

DAVID EASTWICK (VO)
As usual Alberts got it right
Roulette is a suckers game a
palooka bet a shotgun marriage of
chance and superstition Its
where you go at the end of the
night when youve lost almost
everything and your only option
left is to lay it all down bet
big and take your last shot

KA-BLAM Bullets SLAM INTO THE WHEEL sending the ball
flying as SCREAMING AND GUNFIRE roar in and we widen to

INT THE BELLINI — NIGHT

a full fledged GUN BATTLE on the casino floor Screaming
crowds exploding machinery poker chips flying through air

DAVID EASTWICK (V0)
These are the stories of three
mens last shots Three that tell
one There was the Writer

We WHOOSH below a gaming table where a 30-SOMETHING GUY in
Buddy Holly glasses hides covering his head whispering

WRITER
this isnt happening

Bullets SMASH into a slot machine spraying quarters at him
he lets out a shriek as we WHOOSH TO

DAVID EASTWICK (V0)
-the Rockstar

a tubby long-haired MAN IN HIS 40S spinning through the
crowd frantically looking for something screaming out
ROCKSTAR
Foreigner Foreigner

BOOM A shot ZOOMS past his ear across the room and blasts
through the wall We WHOOSH through the bullet hole into

THE CASINOS THEATER

Where a panicked crowd scrambles out On stage a BALD
STAGEHAND desperately yanks at a bullet-smashed WINCH LEVER

BALD STAGEHAND
Hold on up there goddammit

He struggles with the winch looking up at a large curtain-
shrouded BOX suspended above the stage as we WHOOSH TO

INSIDE THE BOX

ewhere a CASINO MAGICIAN is upsidedown submerged in water
handcuffed terrified BEATING THE GLASS A trick gone wrong

DAVID EASTWICK (VO)
and there was me The Magician

Bubbles SPEW from his mouth his eyes roll into his head but
the mans voice remains calm and reasonable as ever

DAVID EASTWICK (VO)
Anyway as I was saying in
roulette when you win you win
everything But when you lose
The magicians body CONVULSES grows limp

DAVID EASTWICK (VO)
now thats a story unto itself

and we SMASH TO BLACK
TITLE CARD THREE DAYS EARLIER
From the darkness we hear
TOMMY (PRE-LAP)

TOMMY

Tommy LUNGES off the stage comes across the kids table in
spray of booze and broken glass and POUNCES as the action
suddenly FREEZES and Tommy HANGS there mid-air until

FRANKLIN GANTT (PRE-LAP)
Now thats nice Real real nice
See how he catches air Who wants
to see it again

WIDEN to REVEAL were watching security footage from

INT SECURITY ROOM —- NIGHT

a surveillance room FRANKLIN GANTT casino owner in a
suit that costs more than most peoples vacations sits by
JAMAL JONES -- the security chief who operates the tape

FRANKLIN GANTT
He actually catches air Its like
one of those Orca whales jumping
out of the ocean

He plays it again Nearby Tommy sits with a black eye and
bloody nose The bandmembers are behind him disgruntled

TOMMY
All due respect Mr Gantt he
started it-

FRANKLIN GANTT
(holds up a finger)
Now heres my favorite part

The footage plays on and Tommy continues his dive through the
air as something strange happens the frat kid GRABS Tommys
arm and WHIRLS him into a post - WHACK
TOMMY
(winces)
Sir if youd just-

FRANKLIN GANTT
(finger up again)

Jamal goes back and forth Whack Rewind Whack Rewind
Over and over again

FRANKLIN GANTT
I love that Whack Right into
the pole Again Oh God thats

JAMAL JONES

FRANKLIN GANTT
Its beautiful because this rotund
piece of penguin-shit got his ass

Mr Underage Frat Boy cannot sue my
casino for millions of dollars
(turns to them)

You rocket scientists are getting
your rate cut by 40 Be happy

The band sheepishly leaves as Gantt turns back to the TV
FRANKLIN GANTT
Play it again The part where the
kid kicks him in the nuts

Jamal hits the play-button as we CUT TO

INT HOUSE IN THE HILLS —- DAY

A movie poster of a female ninja kicking a guy in the nuts

but still hacking away Hes the guy we saw drowning earlier

DAVID EASTWICK

DAVID EASTWICK

An attractive young assistant ZOE rushes to his side as Bob
tries to reload the flowers

ZOE

DAVID EASTWICK

ZOE

DAVID EASTWICK

Bob shrugs clearly not surprised

BOB

ROOOAAAAARRRRRR From in the back wings they hear the sound
of a very pissed-off animal Davids face oh shit CUT TO

INT BELLINI HOTEL CAGE AREA — NIGHT

MITCH EASTWICK late 30s handsome almost a dead-ringer for
his older brother David -- and at the moment gagged bound
and face-to-face with a ROARING ALBINO TIGER Its claws RAKE
his shirt almost drawing blood as hes YANKED AWAY

MITCH (THROUGH GAG)
MMMMMGGGG MMMMMGGGGGGHH

and we see hes duct-taped to a STAND-UP DOLLY hauled by
a pair of heavy suit-wearing straight-outta-Bombay thugs
SUBASH and SUNIL Ladies and gentlemen meet the HINDI MAFIA

(NOTE theyre not FOBs Theyre hardcore gangsters They
just have accents that make them sound unfailingly polite)

SUNIL (singing Meow Mix jingle)
Meow-meow-meow-meow meow-meow-
(off Mitchs moans)
»-what is that you say Mitch I
do not want to become cat-food

SUBASH
How do you like this you are about
to get a Siegfried pulled on you

They push Mitch back towards the cage and the snarling cat
Sunil lifts the broomstick to hit the tiger again-

DAVID EASTWICK (0S)
Do that again and you pull back a
stump

They WHIRL to see David in the door with a prop sword in
hand Looking like hes heard this joke a couple times

DAVID EASTWICK
thats okay though you could
always get a job on the pirate ship
at Treasure Island I hear theyre
looking for a Captain Hook

SUNIL
Oh this man is funny-

DAVID EASTWICK
By the way it was Roy who got
attacked not Siegfried Get it

SUBASH

differentiate gay magicians Cute

DAVID EASTWICK
(grins )
Why thank you Sunil

SUBASH
(points around)
I am Subash He is Sunil

DAVID EASTWICK
Pardon my inability to
differentiate gay mobsters Wanna

Subash angrily makes for David Sunil stops him with a hand
on the shoulder The more reasonable of the two

SUNIL
Your brother owes us--

DAVID EASTWICK
--howd it happen this time

And we SMASH CUT TO

INT BACK ROOM GAMBLING HALL — NIGHT

Mitch plays poker with some BAD DUDES including Subash and
Sunil He tosses down a full house the winning hand -- and
responds with his usual restraint and cultural sensitivity

MITCH
Nope that wasnt an earthquake
boys that was my cards hittin the
table Vishnu cant save you now
shiteaters this is all mine—

Mitch goes for the chips when Sunil YANKS his sleeve back--
revealing a MECHANICAL DEVICE (like Davids) full of cards

MITCH
Uh yeah thats for a show

WHACK Subash STABS HIM IN THE HAND he screams as WE CUT TO

INT BELLINI CASINO BACKSTAGE CAGE AREA — SAME
David grimacing stares at Mitchs now BANDAGED hand

DAVID EASTWICK
Great now how the fuck is he
supposed to be in my act with his
hand like that

SUBASH
Not our problem The money he
cheated belongs to Bhujbal
Malhotra Either he gets it back
or Mitch goes in the tigers belly

On cue Sunil WHEELS MITCH FORWARD again right towards the
cage as David puts an arm out stops them Wearily

DAVID EASTWICK
Ill pay it I always pay it
Just tell me how much and get the
hell outta here

SUBASH
Very well The bill is 62000
(off Davids W-T-F look)
You know where to find us

Subash JABS Willy with the broomstick one last time then
walks past David daring him to do anything David does not
Instead he reaches into the cage strokes the tiger until it
stops growling Then turns to Mitch and yanks out his gag

DAVID EASTWICK
So remember when we talked about
not doing stupid shit that gets us
kicked out of Casinos

MITCH
Thats why I did it off premises
this time
(off his look)
Youre judging me

David shoves the gag back into his mouth and heads out to go
perform APPLAUSE and CHEERING rising as we CUT TO

INT CHERYLS HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The cheering comes from a cheap TV set playing a WWE
wrestling match The Undertaker head-butts The Great Khali

DAVID EASTWICK
Years of experience We couldnt
afford doctors when we were kids
One time this genius tried to
steal the churchs donation plate
Father Kruzynski ended up chasing
him through a stained-glass door
Had to pull a two-inch shard of
Jesuss halo out his ass

MITCH
(off Zoes laugh)
Yeah well the good doctor here

saved him from a good ass-whooping

David nods he remembers Ties up the last stitch

Mitch and David share a worried look as we CUT TO

INT INDIA IMPORTS AND DELICACIES —- DAY

A Bollywood musical plays on a TV inside Indian grocery-
store restaurant where a fat balding gent named BHUJBAL
MALHOTRA sits welcoming David and Mitch to his table

BHUJBAL

Please please you must sit Can I

The spinach pakora is quite good

(they shake their heads)
You are missing out Vegas Weekly

Vegetarian Food in Southeastern
Nevada

DAVID EASTWICK
You should get that framed Your
friends stopped by tonight can we
talk business

BHUJBAL
Yes yes of course Although
strangely I do not see a large
bundle of money anywhere Were you
planning on writing a check or

DAVID EASTWICK
I dont have it Which you know
Which means theres something else
you want What is it

Bhujbal smiles There IS something else he wants He
motions-- come David and Mitch follow him into

THE BACK KITCHEN

ewhere old ladies stir enormous simmering kettles of daal
and curry completely ignoring Sunil and Subash as they wrap
up a BLOODY BODY in cellophane on the floor Various well-

used torture tools (sledgehammer pliers etc) lie about
BHUJBAL
(motions to Sunil)
Show him

They pull away the plastic on the body Davids turns away
nauseous Mitch looks sort of fascinated

MITCH
Man you vegetarians dont fuck
around do you

BHUJBAL

(ignores him)
You ask what I want David What I
want is respect The Italian
Mafia They get respect The
Russians Much glory The Yakuza
Everyone fears the Yakuza But the
Indians

(shakes his head)
People dont even know we exist
Even the Armenian mob gets more
respect and Armenia is a tiny wart
on the backside of Eastern Europe
one hundredth of the size of my
country Often I go to the Video
Hut and ask myself where is the
Indian Scarface Where hides the
Hindi Godfather When will I
turn on my TV and see Indians
robbing 7-11s instead of merely
working at them When

(closes in)
I want to do something so big
David that our name will be put
permanently on the map

DAVID EASTWICK
What does that have to do with us

BHUJBAL
Maybe you dont have the cash
(shrugs)
Maybe your employer does

DAVID EASTWICK
My employer
(sputters)
(MORE)

DAVID EASTWICK (CONTD)
You mean the casino You want to
rob the fucking casino Are you
out of your mind Do you know how
much security the Bellinis got

BHUJBAL
And for this reason we need
someone on inside

DAVID EASTWICK

BHUJBAL

can hold you

DAVID EASTWICK
I escape from vaults I dont break
into them What the hell am I
supposed to do Rob them of
62000 to pay you off

BHUJBAL
You are to rob them of millions

SUNIL
(calls from across room)
Bhuj Look--

Bhuj looks over because the guy on the floor is still
alive He SPASMS trying to suck air through cellophane

Bhujbal rolls his eyes grabs the SLEDGEHAMMER swings it
and CRACK Blood bone and brains SPRAY across his face

BHUJBAL
(turns back to David)
This ones getting buried in the
desert If you think I am asking
too much of you David I can
always what is your phrase
Kill two birds with one stone

He grins and flicks away the BLOODY TOOTH stuck to his
moustache David pales looking at the pulverized man on the
floor getting the message loud and clear as we hear

MITCH (PRE-LAP)
Dude this is great

INT BELLINI CASINO — DAY

David and Mitch mid-conversation walk across The Bellinis
main gambling floor The same place that in three days
will be the site of a massive gun-battle

MITCH
This is like a blessing in
disguise We plan it out put
together a team rob the casino--

DAVID EASTWICK
--can you please refrain from
saying rob the casino while
were you know in the casino

MITCH
Okay okay Im just saying I
dont see what the problem is We
make enough on this score were-

DAVID EASTWICK
We Do you even know what youre
talking about Were not gonna
make any money on this

MITCH
He said were partners That means
we get a cut too right

DAVID EASTWICK
What- No Our cut pays off your
debt remember

MITCH
Oh right

DAVID EASTWICK
More importantly were not doing
this Barring the moral issue that

its wrong--

MITCH
Remember what Mom used to say about
that Only wrong if you get caught

DAVID EASTWICK
Mom also said that black people are
afraid of water Mom was fucking
coo-coo

MITCH
Dude this place is a dinosaur
Security systems like fifty years
old How hard could it be

DAVID EASTWICK
This place may not exactly be the
Bellagio but Franklin Gantt
doesnt skimp on security If he
did hed be broke Now look

He points up at a boxy 80S-LOOKING SECURITY CAMERA on the
ceiling as WE WHOOSH into its lens

DAVID EASTWICK (V0)
Those cameras arent for robbers
Theyre for thieves

where we see the reflection of a huge BANK OF OLD
FLICKERING SURVEILLANCE MONITORS We PULL BACK INTO

THE SURVEILLANCE ROOM
where LOTS of guards watch the monitors as

DAVID EASTWICK
theyre looking for people
trying to nickel and dime the
casino a buck here buck there

»one of the surveillance dudes points at a screen and
Jamal Jones talks into a walkie as we CUT TO

QUICK SHOTS

a MAN IN BOOTS plays blackjack He gets a 21 just as
Jamal grabs him pulls up a pant-leg to reveal a machine
helping him count cards Vroom Taken away in a cop car

a WAITRESS sets down a drink stealthily palms a stack of
chips into her pocket She turns and walks right into Jamal
Who smiles Vroom Taken away in a cop car

a BATHROOM STALL where a MASKED MAN yanks out a gun He
opens the door and WHAM Hes hit point-blank by a BEANBAG
fired from Jamal Jones shotgun

DAVID EASTWICK (VO)
which basically means theyre
sure as hell gonna see if theres
something bigger in the works

the guy flies back and WHOOMPH Lands in an ambulance
gets taken away as we SMASH TO

INT BELLINI CASINO BOOTH - SAME

ethe money changing booth where someone takes a stack of
hundreds in a PLASTIC CASE and shoves it into

DAVID EASTWICK (VO)
Now as for the security below
theyve got one of those old
pneumatic tubes leading straight
from the cashiers hands

the AIR TUBE (like at a bank drive-thru) WHOOSH Were
racing down after it whirring into

THE COUNTING ROOM

-where its picked up and counted by men under the gaze of
the mean-looking SUNUVABITCH FOREMAN

DAVID EASTWICK (V0O)
down to the counting room Even
when they get shipments through the
front it goes right to the vault

A KNOCK at the steel front door The foreman glances at a
security monitor sees a guard with a cart of cash Two
guards on the inside cover him with their guns as we CUT TO

THE VAULT
-where the cart gets pushed in The door -- an old thick
titanium monster with spinning dials -- slams shut

DAVID EASTWICK (VO)
Now the vault was admittedly
installed during the Carter
Administration But theres a
reason that it hasnt been broken
into in thirty years

As the doors close Jamal pulls a chair up in front of it
and sits with a shotgun in his lap

MITCH (VO)
So no ones ever pulled it off

DAVID EASTWICK (VO)
One guy did Did everything right
stole about two million he went
off and hid in Slovakia

We hear CHEERING from somewhere as we SMASH TO
A BAR IN SLOVAKIA

where MR SUCCESSFUL HEIST GUY slams his beer glass down
steals a kiss from a GIRL goes off to the urinal

DAVID EASTWICK (0S)
Jump ahead to six days later

»-and YOINK Hes YANKED BACK spraying urine hauled out
the bathroom doors and directly into

AN UNDERGROUND ROOM IN THE BELLINI

where Jamal Gantt and the guards SLAM our beaten
screaming Mr Successful down before a rusty old BAND-SAW

DAVID EASTWICK (V0O)
»and next thing you know he
finds himself back at The Bellini

His eyes DILATE reflecting the whirring blade as WE CUT TO
BACK WITH DAVID AND MITCH
where pleasant LOUNGE MUSIC percolates in the lobby

DAVID EASTWICK
Guy walks around with a rubber hand
now Getting the point here Mitch

Mitch looks away After a long beat

MITCH

He turns to leave and bumps into Tommy Gives him an
apologetic smile continues on as Mitch blurts after him

MITCH

David waves him off and keeps walking We hang back with
Tommy looking worried leading Foreigner by the hand across

Too clinical I prefer field-
research Eight Oclock Here

DAVID EASTWICK

LUCY
Yeah well most people dont
realize how lucky they are to have
had a few good heartbreaks

SUBASH (SUBTITLED)
You know what I think

Ignoring him Sunil opens the cars trunk -- filled with
severed BODY PARTS wrapped in plastic Subash keeps on him

SUBASH (SUBTITLED)
This is deeply improper Shiva
demands cremation of the deceased
never burial

SUNIL (SUBTITLED)
Yes but Bhujbal demanded burial
and I am frankiy more concerned
about him right now And speaking
of moral improprieties Im pretty
sure Shiva also has rules against
killing a man and chopping him up
into little pieces Now help me
its getting hot out here

Subash grudgingly helps him drag the severed torso out
accidentally knocking an arm free as they carry it over

SUBASH (SUBTITLED)
Im simply saying theres no
reason not to give him a proper--

Just as they see it a COYOTE snags the arm and runs away

SUBASH (SUBTITLED)
Shit

He drops the torso yanks out a gun and SHOOTS after it
misses completely Sunil grabs him pulls the gun down

SUNIL (SUBTITLED)
What are you doing

SUBASH (SUBTITLED)

vacant highway Haggard sunburned near collapse Foreigner
unconscious in his arms Hes eating from a can of Pringles

TOMMY
Why does this always happen

CHERYL (0S8)

Tommy looks over to see Cheryl his ex-wife walking with

all the way out in the desert Just takes it for granted

TOMMY
I wouldnt even be in this

CHERYL

Oh so now its my fault You had
a choice You could have paid your
alimony Could have gotten a job
Could have not gotten fired from

DAVID EASTWICK (PRE-LAP)
So weve got a problem

INT DAVIDS APARTMENT --— DAY

The whole gang is here in Davids living room David Mitch
Bob Zoe Bhujbal Subash and Sunil (with his fingers
hastily sewn back on) hovering over a set of blueprints

DAVID EASTWICK
As you see here Gantts security
system is a gimme Its so old and
outdated it could practically be
playing a show at his casino
(off their look)

Problem is Gantt knows it Which
is why hes drawn up this

David SMACKS DOWN a second set of blueprints A long beat as
everyone looks them over Then--

BOB
Is this what I think it is

DAVID EASTWICK
What do you think it is

BOB
Plans for a new fucking vault

DAVID EASTWICK
Then yes its exactly what you
think it is Its getting installed
on Monday Which gives us

MITCH
(counts on fingers)
two days

David nods Everyone starts talking at once freaking out

BOB
(cuts in over them)
Look guys forget it Deals off

BHUJBAL
Cow-shit If two days is all we
have then we will have to make do

BOB
(to David)
We havent even practiced the trick
yet you could fuckin die in there-
DAVID EASTWICK

Then well just have to be careful

(to everyone)
Now regardless of the security
system our real problem is Gantt
himself He realizes hes been
robbed hell walk the face of the
earth itself to exact his revenge
The mans old testament

(digs into his wallet)
ewhich is why I need about two
million dollars worth of these

David slides a 100 bill across to Bhujbal

BHUJBAL
counterfeit
(off his nod)
If I could counterfeit two million
dollars I would not need you to
rob the casino

DAVID EASTWICK

You dont get it We want to rob
the casino without them KNOWING
theyve been robbed At least for a
while They wont know where to
look or who to focus on As far as
they know the money will have just-—

(snaps his fingers)
-disappeared

A look between them -- this could work just as theres a
KNOCK at the door Everyone freezes glancing at each other

DAVID EASTWICK
Who is it

LUCY (0S8)
Your hot date

Davids face -- shit Motions to the stacks of plans
blueprints piles of incriminating evidence whispers

DAVID EASTWICK
Hide Everything
(louder)
Just a sec sweety

And the gang springs into action scooping up papers
straining for silence as they shuffle into Davids room

as--
DAVID EASTWICK
(opens up for her)
Hey there

Lucy looks at him Hes trying so hard to play innocent

DAVID EASTWICK
what are you doing here

LUCY
Lunch Today
(off his blank stare)

Afghani place curries thatll melt

your face off Remember

DAVID EASTWICK
Right

LUCY
(a little suspicious)

Unless Im interrupting something

MITCH (0S)
Dont be silly

Mitch exits the bedroom carrying a bunch of magic-show props

MITCH
I was just helping David prep for
the show tonight
(extends a hand)
Mitch Resident black sheep

She shakes it he winces David glares -- WIF are you doing

MITCH
You guys go ahead Im just gonna
raid the fridge and order up porn
hope you dont mind

Mitch grabs milk from the fridge drops it

Tries to pick it

up drops it again David steers a (bemused) Lucy out

mouthing over his shoulder-- Get it done

INT AFGHANI RESTAURANT -— DAY

As we CUT TO

David sits at the table a mess sweating sick to his
stomach mind on tonight Lucy sits across from him talking

LUCY
SO this guys about to slit his
wrists in a bathtub and Im the
phone with him and all of a sudden
I hear barking in the background
I ask him Is that your dog He
says Yeah Thats Hungry So I
ask him If you do this whos
gonna feed Hungry And that was
all it took He got out of the
tub Forces of darkness held back
for another day

DAVID EASTWICK
(distracted after a beat)
»-all because some guy had to feed

Hungry

LUCY
Yeah well theres something to be
said for taking care of a creature
that cant care for itself
(grins)
Your brother for example

DAVID EASTWICK
Mitch is not a dog Dogs dont
get into debt And they pee in
public less

LUCY
(laughing)
»SO why do you do it then

DAVID EASTWICK
You mean why do I take care of him
(off her nod)
I owe him

This gets her attention She searches his face a moment

DAVID EASTWICK
Our old neighborhood wasnt the
safest place in the world Neither
was the house we grew up in Mitch
was always tougher than me he took
a lot of the beatings so I didnt
have to It changed him So I
guess its only fair I take one for
him every once in a while

She stares at him flabbergasted

LUCY
Thank you

DAVID EASTWICK
For what

LUCY

For not turning out to be a frog

(off his discomfort)
Im serious you somehow live ten
years in Vegas without turning into
a slimeball you take care of the
people you love no matter what and
you may be the first guy ever who
didnt want something from me or my
father So thank you

(kisses him)
To be honest I was starting to
lose hope

David hides behind his drink face full of self-loathing
Knows he has to make a choice From somewhere we hear

BHUJBAL (PRE-LAP)
So you want out

INT INDIA IMPORTS AND DELICACIES — EVENING

David looking tired and worn and determined sits across
from Bhujbal in the back office of India Imports

DAVID EASTWICK
Thats what I said

Bhujbal eyes him skeptically like hes trying to understand
this strange specimen in front of him the honest man

BHUJBAL
And what you suggest for your
debt a payment plan

DAVID EASTWICK
Ill take a freakin coupon book if
I have to but I cant do this job

BHUJBAL
Care to enlighten me about why
youve had this change of heart

DAVID EASTWICK
(shakes his head)
I cant
(MORE)

DAVID EASTWICK (CONTD)
But you know my word is good and
if I say Im gonna pay you back
then thats exactly what Ill do
Ill even pay interest

BHUJBAL
Im afraid its too late to back
out now In order to get the
counterfeit on such short notice
Ive had to take on a partner

DAVID EASTWICK
Then youll just have to tell him
the deals off Im not doing it

Theres a deadlock for a long beat Then Bhuj relents

BHUJBAL
-Maybe between this and the new
vault and Sunil losing his
fingers perhaps the Gods are not
smiling upon us after all eh

DAVID EASTWICK
(laughs relieved)
You can say that again

WHAM A frying pan connects with Davids skull smashes him
out of his seat as we CUT TO

ROPES

tying David body onto a table All sorts of torture
devices laid out nearby knives sledgehammers bolt cutters
Davids eyes open to see Bhujbal pacing in front of him

BHUJBAL
Tell me David you have heard the
expression What happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas

DAVID EASTWICK
Does this mean were not
negotiating anymore

BHUJBAL
(sighs picks up a saw)
Im very disappointed in you I
expect this kind of behavior in
your brother but-

DAVID EASTWICK (0S)
Look can we stop This is idiotic

Bhuj stops cold -- David is sitting free from his ropes

DAVID EASTWICK
I mean seriously who the hell
tries to tie up an escape artist

Bhujbal glances over to Subash and Sunil as we CUT TO
HANDCUFFS
Clicking into place David now double-locked to the table

BHUJBAL
Where was I

DAVID EASTWICK
What happens in Vegas

BHUJBAL
Oh yes
(resumes pacing)
If this thing does not happen you
will stay in Vegas And by that I
mean several feet underneath-—-

He stops as he turns again because David is sitting on the
table both handcuffs dangling from his fingers

DAVID EASTWICK
Can we just skip to the punchline

Another look between Bhujbal and his goons Then we CUT TO
PLASTIC WRAP

as David even more beat-up now is SARAN WRAPPED to the
table like a mummy Hes pretty freakin immobile

DAVID EASTWICK
Guys cmon this is ridiculous

SHINK Bhujbal grabs a pair of PRUNING SHEARS tosses them
to Sunil (who catches them with his good hand)

BHUJBAL
Start with his pinky

Sunil moves in with the shears

DAVID EASTWICK
Great idea Ever heard of a thief
with no fingers

(MORE)

DAVID EASTWICK (CONTD)
I thought you guys were supposed to
be big on math and logic

Bhujbal nods -- good point Then yanks off Davids shoes
motions Sunil toward his exposed TOES

BHUJBAL
Say yes David Before we are
forced to cut off your toes and
dump them into the shark tank at
Mandalay Bay

DAVID EASTWICK
Bhuj I dont care if I end up ina
curry dish at that shitty
restaurant of yours Im still not
gonna do it And if you kill me
you wont make a fuckin cent

Bhujbal pauses Looks at Sunil whos got Davids BIG TOE
nestled between the shears and motions him off David
slowly lets out a breath As Bhuj turns away

BHUJBAL
I like your girlfriend

The room quiets Bhujbal turns back approaching him slowly

BHUJBAL

You have a fascinating skill - to
disappear in thin air Maybe step
into a box and vanish Maybe your
brother too can share this skill
One minute he is in Vegas and the
next somewhere else But this
girl What is her name -- Lucy

DAVID EASTWICK
You stay the hell away from her-

BHUJBAL

Let me finish David We are both
showmen you and I and I want you
to get the full impact There is no
magic in making something vanish
The real magic is making something
come back

(off his look)
I will make sure Lucy reappears A
leg will appear up in Lake Tahoe
an arm in Reno a breast in Primm

(leans in whispers)
If you do not show me your magic I
will be forced to show you mine

David stares jaw clenched straining against the plastic

BHUJBAL
So I ask you now Mr Magician
are you ready to cooperate

David stares at him knowing hes got no choice choking on
his own bile as we CUT TO BLACK

Then hes lifted over the box upsidedown

MITCH

And plants a kiss on Zoe In the audience Gantt cocks his
head -- nigga what And with a SLAM of the lid Mitch gets
locked inside Bob hits the winch the box is lifted skyward

MITCH
(going under water)
Shit shit shit

He holds his breath fighting back panic Then a curtain
DROPS over the box leaving us in darkness as

BACKSTAGE

Lucys still got David at sword-point eyes focused on the
cash in his duffel bag Davids eyes flicker to the monitor
behind her Mitch in the box struggling to find the key

LUCY
