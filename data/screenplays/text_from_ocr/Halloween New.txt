EXT SMITHS GROVE STATE HOSPITAL DAY

A cold brick building Isolated Surrounded on all sides by
barbed-wire fencing

A RENTAL CAR pulls up to the SECURITY GATE A SECURITY GUARD
checks the credentials of the driver The Guard nods to the
GUARD BOOTH The GATE OPENS The rental car drives through

INT SECURITY STATION SMITHS GROVE STATE HOSPITAL DAY
CLOSE ON A HAND holding a MICROPHONE The hand cranes the
mike around the to pick up sounds of maniacal laughter
echoing from the corridor

INSERTS of the corresponding inspiration of these sounds
REVEAL DANA HAINES (30s) activating a TAPE RECORDER

with AARON JOSEPH-KOREY both scholarly British Aaron
signs some documents at a CHECK-IN DESK They look to each

other Aaron speaks into her microphone

DANA
Check check

AARON
Testing testing One two three

Among the SECURITY GUARDS a NURSE works behind the security
desk of what looks to be a minimum security institution The
nurse places a needle on a record player A joyous song from
a 1930s musical plays

Aaron looks through the security window and sees a DOCTOR

writing something down and speaking to a PATIENT and a
guard

KUNEMAN His ballpoint pen runs out of ink He shakes it

discards it and then reaches into his lab coat pocket for a

more elegant pen to complete his prescription and signature

He glances through the glass at his visitors

Dana raises her mic to the door WE HEAR SOUNDS through
warped distortion THEN A loud BUZZER snaps us back to
reality as a ward activates the door lock

CLOSE ON The mechanics of the security locks bars etc

A GREEN LIGHT FLASHES as the door opens and DR RANBIR
SARTAIN appears A psychiatrist with a thick accent

DR SARTAIN
Good afternoon Im Dr Ranbir
Sartain

DANA
Thank you for taking the time to
meet with us We were hoping to
have this chance before he is
transferred to the new facility
Glass Hill is far less
accommodating

DR SARTAIN
Glass Hill is the pit of hell
Underfunded and short staffed For
years he has been kept here to be
studied I suppose the state has
lost interest in discovering
anything further

AARON
Well Thats why were here

DANA
Do you mind if I record this

DR SARTAIN
(A SMILE)
Why not
INT HALLWAY SMITHS GROVE STATE HOSPITAL DAY

A loud BUZZER as the door shuts Sartain escorts Aaron and
Dana down a hall Disturbed faces of PATIENTS pass Many
behind bars others with CLINICAL ESCORTS Dana records
Sartain as they walk

DANA
How long have you been working with
him

DR SARTAIN
Ive examined every case file
written on him I was a scholar of
Dr Loomis before he passed away
Then I lobbied the University of
Illinois to be assign to Michael
myself

DANA
Any progress

DR SARTAIN
He has been seen by over 50
clinical psychiatrists And with
each many different opinions
Loomis reasoned that he was nothing
more than pure evil

DANA
Any you agree with this diagnosis

DR SARTAIN
Evil is not a diagnosis Under my
care we implemented a holistic
form of therapy Since that time
his tendency for violence has
essentially been erased

AARON
His response to your specific
treatment has been effective

DR SARTAIN
We left two kitty cats in his cell
overnight and both remained
unharmed
(A SMILE)
I hate to disappoint you
Aaron stop walking

AARON
So youre telling us that there is
no similarity between the murderous
maniac that made newspaper
headlines in 1978 and the amenable
patient of this institution

Sartain laughs

DR SARTAIN
Michael Myers is an evolving aging
creature like we all are And
although we have worked very
closely with him these halls
display the limitations of my
analysis Loomis saw Michael as a
beast in the wild He witnessed
human behavior at its most primal
while the rest of us only have the
opportunity of observation in
captivity

Sartain uses a key to open a heavy door that leads into

EXT COURTYARD SMITHS GROVE STATE HOSPITAL DAY

Sartain walks them into an outside courtyard A few
DISFIGURED or DISABLED RESIDENTS roam about

DR SARTAIN

Our patients get fresh air and
sunshine a view proper exercise
a healthy diet It pains me to see
him transferred to a less than
desirable facility

(POINTING)
There he is He can speak He
just chooses not to

Aaron and Dana look WE FIND THE SHAPE OF A MAN sixty feet
away standing shackled to the ground in the middle of the
concrete yard A YELLOW PAINTED SQUARE creates a twenty foot
frame around him Tall strong aged dressed in white

TWO SECURITY OFFICERS stand watch SIX OTHER PATIENTS stand
scattered through the yard
AARON
Id love to stand near him and get
a sense of his awareness Or lack
of awareness

DR SARTAIN
Make no mistake He is aware He
was watching you as you arrived
When hes not out here in the
courtyard he walks from this
window to that window to the
other Observing things

Aaron and Dana look curiously to each other

DR SARTAIN (CONTD)
(TO AARON)
And perhaps youd like to tie your
left shoelace Mr Tovoli the
gentleman with the umbrella has a
fixation for such things
Underestimate no one

A patient holding AN UMBRELLA in the sunshine bites a
fingernail and smiles at them Embarrassed Aaron bends down
to tie his clean white sneaker

DR SARTAIN (CONTD)
Step up to the yellow line No
further Do not pass the line under
any circumstance

Sartain looks to the security guards for reassurance and
then
walks Aaron and Dana to the yellow line on the concrete

The Shape stands with his back to them Sartain calls out

DR SARTAIN (CONTD)
Michael I have some people who
would like to meet you

Aaron clears his throat

AARON
Michael My name be Aaron Ive
followed your case for years and I
still know very little about you I
want to know more about that night
steps

then

About those involved
The Shape is motionless

AARON (CONTD)
Do you think of them Feel guilt
about their fate

Nothing
Aaron looks back to Dana with a shrug She hesitantly
forward to join her partner

AARON (CONTD)
Do you remember Laurie Strode

The Shape stretches his fingers and then rests his hand at
his side Sartain notices

AARON (CONTD)
Does she remind you of your sister
Michael Is that why you chose
her

The Shape half turns as if hes going to respond but
doesnt

Aaron looks back to Sartain He nods to Aaron to go ahead
Aaron looks to Dana She unzips her bag

AARON (CONTD)
I borrowed something from a friend
at the Attorney Generals office
Something Id like you to see

Aarons hand goes inside Danas shoulder bag and pulls out a
portion of a WHITE HALLOWEEN MASK Familiar

Sartain looks to see this exchange Aaron holds the mask out
before him The Shape makes no movement The other patients

become restless Pacing madly Dana looks around concerned
Aaron doesnt lower the mask

AARON (CONTD)
You recognize this dont you
Michael How does it make you feel
Say something
louder

A few of the patients start screaming Testing their
restraints like rabid animals

Dana looks to Sartain He is concerned

More patients join in stomping and screaming getting
and louder

Aaron shouts back to The Shape

AARON (CONTD)
Say SOMETHING

The courtyard has been worked into a frenzied chorus of
madness but The Shape remains still

rehabilitation if she faces him
again

DANA

Aaron and Dana stop the car and look to an intercom next to
an overflowing mail box

She holds

DANA (CONTD)

Laurie doesnt respond An awkward moment Dana nods at
Aaron
and steps in

DANA
Aaron and I have made several award
winning public radio exposes Our
last project shed fresh light ona
murder case from twenty years ago
We like to re-examine incidents
with an unbiased lens When people
are willing to face a thing ina
different light over time new
truths can sometimes emerge I
believe there is a lot to learn
from the horror you experienced

LAURIE
Theres nothing to re-examine
Nothing to learn from something
that happened forty years ago
AARON

Loomis from after that horrific
night

abstract and apocalyptic
observations

He just wanted Michael dead and no
one would listen

killed his sister when he was six
years old And then he came after

rehabilitation

LAURIE

-Because everyone knows 40 years is

Dana switches gears

DANA
Lets talk about when the state
came to take your daughter away

OFFICER HAWKINS
From a clinical perspective would
you say that Laurie Strode has lost
her fucking marbles

DR SARTAIN
here are many ways for tragedy to
hange a victim They can grow
ccustomed to always being afraid
hey can become weak or they can
ecome strong But there is also
he other side

toHoaH

OFFICER HAWKINS
What side is that

DR SARTAIN

The core of the victimizer This is
what has intrigued me through my
studies How does a crime like
Michaels change him What is he
feeling Is he on a random path or
is he emotionally driven Triggered
by something Some unheard marching
order imprinted on his very being
Evil incarnate Michael and I had a

around

special connection but without his
verbal participation there was a
side of his mad journey that I
could never understand

OFFICER HAWKINS

Walk a mile in another mans shoes
or something like that right Not
for me brother

DR SARTAIN
Tell me what become of his
childhood home

OFFICER HAWKINS

That old place was a shrine kinda-
thing but for serial killer
groupies and death metal bands
Vandals got the best of it A local
organization that I work with tore
it down and turned it into a
community garden Turned tragedy
into beauty if you can consider it

limping She grabs a tree to catch her breath

She sees the disturbing SILHOUETTES OF MANNEQUINS that
used as target practice Frozen expressions with bullet
ridden faces all around her

INT LAURIES HOUSE NIGHT

Ray plays with the untangled yo-yo that Laurie had at the
community center He watches the security camera monitors

He sees a police cruiser slowly rolling up to the front of
the house It hits a couple of garbage cans and then stops

Curious he gets up and goes to the front door The door has
two small windows with color glass He sees the cruiser with
lights flashing

EXT LAURIES HOUSE NIGHT

Ray steps out onto the front porch with the yo-yo as the

chimes blow in the breeze

Any word on Allyson
No response

cruiser Ray waves No response

Ray loses his balance and takes a step back He hears the
familiar wind chimes

Ray turns slowly and sees THE SHAPE step up behind him and
instantly wrap the chain of the wind chime around Rays
He chokes and wheezes and swings his arms wildly trying to

save himself

After a great struggle he falls to the ground Dead

SHANAH
What about Ray What about Allyson

LAURIE
Ill take care of it Its time
Now It all ends tonight

Shanah nods through tears and runs to the kitchen She spins
the island counter clock-wise She shares a look with Laurie
as her mother takes position Armed at the front door Is
this good-bye

Shanah disappears into the shelter and the island slides
back covering the secret door

Laurie turns back toward the window with her shotgun to keep
an eye along The Shape Before she gets a glance the glass
of one window smashes

THE SHAPES RIGHT ARM reaches through and grabs her by the
side and then slides to her throat Her weapon is useless as
he pulls her into the door

THE OTHER ARM punches through the other window and reaches
desperately for her

She spins around until her back is to the door Her left
reaches up and grabs hold of The Shapes spastic hand

With her right hand Laurie PUMPS HER SHOTGUN and points it
toward The Shapes LEFT HAND He grabs hold of the barrel

she pulls the trigger HIS LEFT HAND EXPLODES TWO FINGERS
disintegrated by the blast His thumb and two others remain
He lets go and his arms retreat

INT LAURIES HOUSE BASEMENT NIGHT

Shanah hears footsteps above her She looks and considers
overwhelming arsenal beside her A crossbow a semi-

rifle a shotgun and a small handgun etc

She grabs the smallest firearm on the wall and walks to the
base of the ladder as footsteps pace above her

She hears the island move aside and the hinges of the door
with

she

face

The

lift open

Shes nervous but the gun is ready She pulls the trigger-
CLICK

LAURIE
It only works if you load it
Sweetheart
Shes relieved to see her mother who climbs quickly down

her shotgun to join her

Laurie walks to the wall and exchanges her pump-action
shotgun for a rifle

She flips a circuit breaker to turn the lights off upstairs
and then flips a switch to slide the island back into place

They listen quietly as Laurie loads rounds into the rifle

The sound of the front door opening FOOTSTEPS above them
Dust falls from the ceiling

Laurie tracks the steps with the site of her gun

LAURIE (CONTD)
Hes right there

Laurie fire three rounds into the ceiling at the position

suspects The SHAPE to be All goes silent

EXT LAURIES HOUSE NIGHT
Allyson approaches and sees the house through the trees

full with both fear and relief

INT LAURIES HOUSE LIVING ROOM NIGHT

CLOSE on Laurie as she rises from her basement door with her
rifle ready

She looks around the dark living room and sees no sign of

Shape Her senses are on high alert
LAURIE

She hears a noise turns and fires Blasts a hole in the
wall

of the living room The muzzle flash lights the room

LAURIE (CONTD)
Michael Come out

Another sound BLAM She fires at a shadow
A tree branch hits the window
She turns blasts the kitchen pantry

Laurie walks to the living room Blasts the staircase
upstairs

She disappears into a back room We hear a three more
blasts

She comes back out and looks toward a living room closet
She
shoots a hole in it Listens Hears weeping in the distance

She looks out the broken window of the front door and sees
Allyson crying Her granddaughter kneeled over the body of
her dead father

Laurie switch gears from a predator to the protector

LAURIE (CONTD)

She run to her upset granddaughter

LAURIE (CONTD)
Im so sorry Its not over You

forces

door and sees The Shape standing on the porch

ALLYSON
Grandmother

Laurie turns and instinctively aims the gun toward The Shape
and fires The bullet blasts directly over The Shapes
shoulder A porch light shatters

-- Miss Shes out of bullets

Laurie quickly drops the gun and pulls a large hunting knife
out of a sheath on her belt The Shape stands with a kitchen
knife in his hand A CLASSIC SHOWDOWN

He steps off the porch toward her Laurie looks back and

Allyson stumbling backwards

With the mind-set of a mamma bear Laurie turns back to The
Shape and charges him

Their blades meet Limbs entangled The Shape loses blood
from his missing fingers but his momentum is relentless He
drives his knife into Lauries chest She swings and slices
his arm

Allyson screams

On THE PORCH We see Shanah slowly opening the front door
with the POINT OF A HIGH TECH CROSSBOW

After a brief struggle The Shape twists his knife and

Laurie to the ground He pulls the blade out

Shanahs eyes swell with fear Her jaw shakes as she takes
aim She considers the shot but instead lowers the crossbow
in defeat

Then Laurie catches her eye from the ground A neutral
expression of control that says everything

The Shape lifts his knife back for the deathblow and before
it falls Shanah raises the crossbow and pulls the trigger
RELEASES HER ARROW

It penetrates The Shape from behind Underneath his right
shoulder The point and beak jut out by inches

The Shape DROPS HIS knife and pulls the pointer and slides

back and forth He gets to his feet and struggles to remove
it

Allyson walks toward them and grabs the fallen knife

She keeps The Shape at bay as she grabs her grandmother

her arms and drags her back through the yard

The Shape stumbles forward into the woods

Shanah runs to Allyson and Laurie They help her to her feet
as she bleeds Nearly unconscious They put pressure on the
wound

EXT LAURIES HOUSE NIGHT

In a flurry of motion and panic Shanah and Allyson run with
Laurie As they struggle down the long dark wooded

driveway they breathe heavily exhausted physically and
emotionally Feet drag bodies strain The effort is

Laurie looks back at The Shape disappearing into the trees
She is in and out of consciousness

LAURIE
Kill it Kill it It must die

Her whispers fall on deaf ears

Shanah and Allyson miss it in the strain of their efforts
They reach the gate which has been broken open

Shanah holds Laurie while Allyson steps into the road and
looks both ways

Hawkins abandoned squad car in one direction and a pair of
headlights in the other direction

Allyson waves her arms as the headlights approach
A PICK-UP TRUCK pulls over

Shanah lifts Laurie toward the truck Allyson helps

THE DRIVER drops the gate of the bed of the truck

The driver helps the severely injured Laurie into the truck

Her daughter and granddaughter get in sit beside her and
hold her tight

The truck ROARS INTO DRIVE and speeds down the road

The woman rest stunned and numb and reflective of the night
behind them

EXT WOODS NIGHT

The Shape wounded He pulls the arrow from his chest and
moves through the forest

SIRENS WAIL in the distance His WHITE mask catching the
moonlight

The Shape comes to a clearing He turns and looks back in

direction of Lauries house He watches BREATHING

He touches his chest Feels his wounds his missing fingers

We reveal that he is standing among the shattered artificial
faces of mannequins

The Shape walks to a tree and takes a seat His head tilts
back as his hand presses into his blood stained clothing

breathing deepens

Exhausted or possibly his last
