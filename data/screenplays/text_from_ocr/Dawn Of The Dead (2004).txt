The HUM emanates from a NOISY WINDOW AIR CONDITIONER The
first light of day slices around duct tape holding the
machine in place

PAN DOWN PAST an old digital clock on a nightstand - the
numbers flip to 637 am -- and TO a double bed where Ana
and Luis sleep curled up like babies

A bedroom door is near the foot of the bed It slowly opens
And as this is a horror film it CREAKS

been torn from her face leaving a toothy death-grin Her
skin is bluish A bloody gash runs along her neck She
opens her mouth and lets out a HIDEOUS MOAN She raiees her
arms toward Luis as if to be lifted

decisively down the embankment

A priest didn’t tell this to me my
music teacher did my first good
music teacher He said don’t play
the notes Play the spaces between
the notes That’s where the music
is that’s where you ate and
that’s where infinity is The
vibration of the note fills in that
space That’s what I thought about
when I played in the church the
space between the notes as the time
when everyones prayers went to
God

NICOLE
You said you didn’t believe in God

BRUCE
I believe in eternity Whatever we
do here somehow like a note that
dies before the next note theres

fix them up reinforce them and
then drive the fuck out of here at
