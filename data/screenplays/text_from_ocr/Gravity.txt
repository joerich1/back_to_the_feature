TITLE-

GRAVITY

BLACK-

OUTER SPACE 600 KILOMETERS ABOVE-

PLANET EARTH

Like all images of Earth seen from space this image of our
planet is mythical and majestic
in
white
deep

yellow

Earth
it is

is-

modules

at

laps

Somalia

The globe seems almost tangible slowly spinning floating
the endless void of space It is a blue planet and bright
clouds twirl and stretch in capricious patterns across the
blue of the oceans and the jigsaw of continents green
and brown
It is noon in Cape Town and early night in India
The sphere is almost a perfect orb except for the darkened
sliver on its Eastern edge
It is beautiful And so full of life
But not here
Here it is completely silent

SILENCE-
IN THE DISTANCE-
A small metal object crosses the empty space surrounding

If it appears to be a small satellite that is only because

far away from us It is the size of one football field It

The INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS)

It resembles a dragonfly Its solar panels stretch out like
wings from the long body made of connected pressurized

It floats with a sense of proud achievement

It orbits at an altitude of 500 km above sea level It moves
an average of 27700 kilometers per hour completing 157
around the Earth per day

It is cruising over Zimbabwe To the East the island of
Madagascar Up to the North the expansive dry lands of

and Ethiopia
Soon the ISS curves around the spherical planet and it

becomes

smaller almost indistinguishable no more than a small
bright

spec grazing over the blue atmosphere

CLOSER TO US-

Orbiting at an altitude of 600 km-

The EXPLORER SPACE SHUTTLE becomes visible

This icon of space exploration has played a key role in all
of

NASAs missions since the late 90s

Faintly we hear static voices murmuring over radio
frequences
As the babble bulds we might hear one conversation amongst
the
REST

Well medical doesnt agree doctor
Are you feeling nauseous

RYAN
Not any more than usual Houston
Diagnostics are green Linking to

An ASTRONAUT - MATT KOWALSKI - floats thirty meters away
from

the Shuttle wearing a bulky white space suit anda full
bubble-

like helmet

ASTRONAUT
Houston I have a bad feeling about
this mission

MISSION CONTROL
Please expand
MATT
Okay let me tell you a story It was
96 Id been up here 42 days Every
time I passed over Texas Id look
down knowing the second Mrs Kowalsky
was looking up thinking of me Six
weeks Im blowing kisses to that
woman Then we land at Edwards and I
find out shed run off with a lawyer
before I was off the launch pad so I
packed my car and I headed to

MISSION CONTROL
Tijuana Youve told this story
owalsky As Houston recalls she
took off in your 74 GTO Engineering
requests fuel status on the jet pack
prototype

Matt smiles checks the monitors of the sleek device

strapped to

from

his back

MATT
Five hours off the reservation and I
show 30 drain My compliments to
Engineering Except for a slight
malfunction on the nulling of the roll
axis this jetpack is one prime piece
of thrust

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)
Engineering says thank you

MATT
Tell them I still prefer my 67
Corvette though Speaking of which did
I ever tell you the--

MISSION CONTROL
(ON RADIO)
We know the Corvette story Matt

MATT
Even Engineering

MISSION CONTROL
Especially engineering Were going
to miss you Matt

Matt grins fiddles with a control and propels himself away
the Shuttle

Stationed around the telescope are TWO ASTRONAUTS carrying
out a

repair mission They are also wearing space suits but unlike

Matt they are not wearing Manned Maneuvering Units SAFETY

TETHERS are the only things stopping them from floating away

into space

RYAN
Comm card reboot in progress

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)
Thank you doctor Shariff whats your
status

SHARIFF
Nearly there Replacing battery module
Al and C

SHARIFF DASARI is an Indian engineer in his mid-thirties He
is

attached with tethers to a platform on one side of the
Hubble

This is his second mission into outer space

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)
Could you be more specific
Indeterminate estimates make Houston
anxious

SHARIFF
No no no Houston dont be
anxious Anxiety is not good for the
heart The system is ready to re-
activate

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)
Hubble Telescope engaged Upgrade
fully functional That applause you
hear is for you Shariff
Congratulations Kick back take the
rest of the day off

Shariff cheers and begins singing a pop tune in Hindi
bursting

into a Zero-G Bollywood choreography that is repressed by
the

stiffness of his space suit
SHARIFF

(SINGING)
Woohoo Jaise Baadal Paani Ka Yaarana
Hai Oh Jaise Paani Ka Yaarana Hai

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)
Matt please advise as to Mission
Specialist Shariffs current activity

MATT
He appears to be doing the Macarena of
some sort Though that would merely be
a best guess scenario on my part

Matt is now approaching the Explorer skillfully maneuvering

his

thrusters

The other astronaut stands perched on a ROBOTIC ARM attached
to

the Shuttle The arm is a crane-like moving platform
remotely

operated from inside the Shuttle
We TRACK In on the astronaut as she works intently alone

MISSION CONTROL
Dr Stone Houston Medical now have
you with a temperature drop to 359
and heart rate rise to 70
How are you doing

RYAN
Houston Im fine its just

(SHE SWALLOWS)
Keeping your lunch down in zero G
is harder than it looks

MISSION CONTROL
Doctor Stone Medical is asking if you
want to return to Explorer

Ryan HUMS as she jiggles the CARD

RYAN
No weve been here for a week
Houston lets just finish this

RYAN STONE is a medical engineer specialized in hospital
scanning systems Shes focused on her work as though shes
all
alone in the world This is her first mission
Ryan eyes the Card then

RYAN (CONTD (CONTD)
Card is up

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)
Thats a negative Im afraid were
getting nothing on this end doctor

Ryan eyes the Card then

RYAN
Try again

MISSION CONTROL
(a beat then)
Still nothing

RYAN
Houston could you please turn that
music off

MISSION CONTROL
(ON RADIO)
Kowalsky

MATT
Not a problem

Matt toggles a switch and the music stops

RYAN
Thank you Kowalsky

Ryan moves the Card around

RYAN (CONTD)
Now Houston

MISSION CONTROL
Negative

RYAN
Could Houston be misinterpreting the
data--

MISSION CONTROL
(ON RADIO)
Were not receiving any data
Engineering is recommending a vis-
check for component damage

Again as if to herself-

RYAN
Mmmm Let me see whats going on

She starts to disengage one of the panels

RYAN (CONTD)
(MUMBLES)
What have you got here

Ryan takes out a card from under the plate and begins to
examine

it Matt begins to approach her

RYAN (CONTD)
Visual examination doesnt reveal any
damaged components The problem must
be originating in the comms panel

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)
That seems to be the case Engineering
admits that you warned us that this
could happen Thats as close to an
apology as youre going to get from
them We shouldve listened to you
doc

Without losing any time Ryan puts the card back into the
TELESCOPE-

RYAN
Im on it

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)
Copy that How long do you think itll
take you

Matt begins a wide loop around the telescope
RYAN
An hour

MISSION CONTROL

(ON RADIO)
Outstanding We appreciate your
patience Doctor Installing your
system in the Hubble is the main
he

purpose of this mission
Ryan doesnt respond continuing to work Matt closes in as

circles the telescope

MISSION CONTROL (CONTD)

Houston trusts Mission Commander
Kowalsky realizes that this delay is
not of sufficient duration to enable
him to surpass Anatolys Solovyevs
spacewalking record as most recent
calculations indicate that he will be
left

MATT
Seventy-five minutes shy Never
crossed my mind

MISSION CONTROL
(ON RADIO)
Matt Its been a privilege

Matt hesitates ever-so-briefly then

MATT
Right back atcha Houston

MISSION CONTROL
(ON RADIO)
Enjoy your last walk

MATT
Am I a go to assist Dr Stone in
removing the panel

RYAN
Assistance appreciated

Ryan begins unbolting Matt lands right next to Ryan and
onto the telescope She is frustrated determined

MATT
How are you feeling

RYAN
Like a Chihuahua thats being tumble
dried

Matt takes out his pistol grip and with fast precision puts

head to a bolt and begins unscrewing Matt removes the bolt
with confidence

MATT
Its been a rough week If it makes
you feel any better I puked up
everything but my kidneys on my first

ride

Ryan is not as precise with her pistol grip and when a bolt
COMES OFF-

She DROPS IT

RYAN
Whoa AWOL

The bolt spins floating away She tries to grab it but
barely touching it but brushing it just enough to give ita
that makes it change direction

She turns and reaches out to grab it but she is strapped to

Robotic Arm

The bolt spins out into the emptiness of space when-

A hand GRABS it before it has gone too far It is Matts

Ryan looks at him embarrassed

RYAN (CONTD)
Thanks Sorry In my basement lab
things usually fall to the floor
Matt puts the bolt away He begins to unscrew another bolt
MATT
Hey -- youre the genius up here I
just drive this bus

RYAN
Call me a genius if I can get this
board initialized in the next hour

MISSION CONTROL
Explorer this is Houston

EXPLORER CAP
Go ahead Houston

MISSION CONTROL
NORAD reports a satellite has incurred
a missile strike The impact has
created a cloud of debris orbiting at
20000 miles per hour Current debris
orbit does not overlap with your
trajectory Well keep you posted on
any developments

Ryan glances at Matt

RYAN
Should we be worried

MATT
Let the boys down there worry for us

RYAN
Explorer engage arm and pivot to
cargo bay

EXPLORER CAP
(ON RADIO)
Standby for arm maneuver

The robotic arm moves very slowly pulling Ryan along while
Matt

begins to unharness from the telescope to shift his
position

MATT
So doc now that you work for NASA
how do you like it

SHARIFF
Kinda like winning the lottery isnt
it
She grins at the memory glances at him

RYAN
I was just happy that they didnt cut
the funding to my research

MATT
How long was your training

RYAN
Six months

SHARIFF
Including holidays

MATT
So what is this scanning system

SHARIFF
Nothing rad its just a new set of
eyes to scan the universe

RYAN
Assuming it works its just for
hospital use This one is a prototype

EXPLORER CAP
Standby for marking

MATT
Listen they dont bankroll
prototypes even for your pretty blue
eyes

She gives him a look

RYAN
My eyes are brown

Confesses

Matt stares at her a faint smile on his face

MATT
Right now your eyes are blood shut

She grins looks away -- he got her Then

SHARIFF
Kowalsky

Matt turns Shariff raises his arms again

SHARIFF (CONTD)
and

waist

whites

as

Is this great or what
Shariff JUMPS and FLOATS AWAY from the Shuttle screaming

flapping his arms A long SAFETY TETHER attached to his
TENSES AND-

Brings Shariff to an ABRUPT STOP snapping him back like a
bungee cord

MATT
(for Ryans benefit)
And to think he went to Harvard

Ryan doesnt react to this too consumed as she is with the
panel Matt looks out A sad smile is on his face

MATT (CONTD)
You gotta admit one thing You cant
beat the view
MATT ENJOYS THE VIEW

THE EARTH with its ever-changing surface of blues and

greens and browns is massive and serene below him

RYAN
Mm-hm
MATT
Mmm So what do you like about being
up here
She hesitates -- trying sincerely to articulate her feelings

we GAZE down at the silent planet below

RYAN

The silence
(BEAT)
I could get used to it

Matt laughs softly
We arrive back on him as he turns back to look at Earth
Something flickers briefly in Matts eyes-- something

COMPLICATED --

MATT
Hmmmm Terrific
ahead

Ryan inspects a panel inside the telescope studying it with
small mirror

RYAN
Houston from first inspection comms
panel appears to be dead Am I a go
to cut link to auxiliary

MISSION CONTROL
Youre the expert doctor Its your
call

Ryan takes out the small mirror and Matt stretches his arm
offering assistance but-

She does not want any help and puts the mirror away in her
toolbox leaving Matt with his arm outstretched

Ryan starts looking for another tool but Matt is one move
of her offering her a pair of tweezers

Ryan hesitates and takes the tool She starts working on the
panel

MATT
Houston I have a bad feeling about
this mission

MISSION CONTROL
Please elaborate

MATT
Its the same feeling I had at Mardi
Gras in 1987

He waits letting the moment hang knowingly Then

MISSION CONTROL
That is affirmative Surprisingly
control hasnt heard the Mardi Gras
story Please proceed

MATT
Well its day one and Im bumping my
way down Bourbon Street looking for
the sister of a friend of mine The
streets are swimming with people Im
thinking theres no way Im finding
this girl

Ryan rolls her eyes and mumbles to herself-
RYAN
Proceeding to over ride

Matt continues his story without missing a beat-

MATT
Then all of a sudden I look up and --
there she is

A PIECE of the debris HITS the Hubbles SOLAR PANELS
12-inch HOLE in its golden surface

A piece of debris passes nearly hitting them

SHARIFF
Need some help there Matt

making
MATT
No dont wait for us Get inside

RYAN
Its stuck

Further back another piece of debris collides with a bigger

one The two chunks of debris explode into a million pieces
of

shrapnel one of which-

HITS Shariffs helmet breaking through the glass and
hitting
his head like an expansive bullet

MATT
Man down Man down

Matt PROPELS himself toward Shariff who is floating away
from
the Shuttle unconscious

MATT (CONTD)
(TO RYAN)

Disengage

AN IMPACT
A piece of debris pierces through the right wing of the
Space
Shuttle creating a five-foot hole
THE SPACE SHUTTLE ROLLS
The arm with Ryan attached to it rolls with the Shuttle
MATT (CONTD)
Explorer has been hit Explorer do you
read Explorer over Explorer--

Another IMPACT

A piece of debris HITS the robotic arm like a cannon ball
and

DETACHES it from the Shuttle

The broken piece of the arm SPINS AWAY from the Explorer at

great speed with Ryan attached to it She passes next to-

THE HUBBLE as a big piece of debris hits the telescope The
top
of the cylinder explodes into more debris which is expelled

in

all directions barely missing Ryan as she spins away
attached

to the arm

ON THE ARM-

Ryans panic grows as she spins further into the nothingness
of

space

MATT (CONTD)
Astronaut off structure Dr Stone is

You must detach

RYAN
No

MATT
£ you dont detach that arm is going

Ok Im trying I cant its stuck

Hold on

Ryans hands are trembling and she cant get a grip on the

MATT
Houston Ive lost visual of Dr
Stone Houston Ive lost visual of

As Matts VOICE is LOST to STATIC Ryan squeezes the hook
is
gone kicking herself AWAY from the robotic arm and

FREE of the rotating arm She catches a brief glimpse of the

as it helicopters away then loses sight of it as she
end over end in endless free fall
A PRIMAL SCREAM of God forsaken fear erupts from her lungs
The RADIO CRACKLES and Matts VOICE returns
MATT (CONTD)
Dr Stone Do you copy Repeat Do
you copy
RYAN
Yes Yes I copy Im detached
Ryan slowly spins drifting into the empty darkness of

MATT
Give me your position
RYAN
I dont know I dont know Im
spinning I cant I cant

MATT
Report your position

Tumbling end over end Ryan fixes her gaze on her wrist The
effort makes her nauseous She looks away

RYAN
GPS isdown I cant its down I
cant

MATT

Give me a visual

Matts faint voice is heard on the transmission under a lot
of

static Ryan is panicking and begins to hyperventilate Her
eyes

rake the dark sameness of her surroundings

RYAN
I told you Nothing I see nothing

MATT
Do you have a visual of Explorer

RYAN
No--

MATT
Do you have a visual of ISS

RYAN
No--

As Matts signal grows fainter her breathing becomes more

labored

MATT
I need you to focus Give me a
visual anything

Ryans eyes flutter then roll up into her sockets
RYAN
Its too fast
INSIDE THE HELMET-

Ryan swallows harshly her throat suddenly dry
RYAN (CONTD)
I cant breathe I cantbreathe

She inhales and exhales with quick short breaths-
AHHHH OHHHH
AHHHH OHHHH

Ryans eyes are wide open and desperate as her breathing
accelerates

AHH OHH AHH OHH
AHH OHH AHH OHH

Her limbs look fragile against the black and incalculable

void

AHH OHH AHH OHH

She inhales

AHH

And her throat closes

HH

Her mouth is open but she cannot exhale

Not a breath

Ryans choking The lack of oxygen is making her veins pop
out

and her lips turn blue

Her eyes open wide and-

She exhales

OHH

And begins breathing deeply

AHHHHHH OHHHHHH

As her breathing steadies she begins to focus her eyes

searching the distance
THROUGH THE HELMET-
the

drifts

sphere

Ryan can see her face reflected against the visor lit by
control panels

She dims the light and she can see-

Her legs and arms floating against endless space as she

towards the empty void broken only by lonesome stars whose
position change as she rotates giving way to-

THE EARTH
Very still and very distant Night is creeping across the

as the sun sets a sliver of light on the Western

Hemisphere

the

in

on

A metallic object floating over the Earth is hit by a RAY of
sinking sun and it gleams like a tiny star Her eyes blink
recognition gleaming with alertness
Her intellect engages and she gains a new sense of calm
RYAN (CONTD)
Houston this is Dr Ryan Stone Im

drifting but I have a visual of
Explorer

Her eyes scan the enveloping darkness trying to get a fix

the gleaming orb that is earth her face alive with
concentration as she makes calculations

RYAN (CONTD)
With North at 12 oclock the Shuttle
is at the center of the dial

She frowns as she tumbles backward again recalculating

The sun is slipping behind the Earth She studies the rim of
fire until it too slides from view

RYAN (CONTD)
I can see the Chinese station No no
no its the International Space
Station

The suns glow illuminates another object in the distance a
bright spec hovering over the horizon- the INTERNATIONAL

SPACE
STATION
RYAN (CONTD)
ISS is at 6 no 7 oclock
Just then the suns rays recede and the Station DIMS
becoming
one with the darkness Ryan blinks mildly alarmed
INSIDE THE HELMET-
RYAN (CONTD)
Lieutenant Kowalsky do you copy
Silence
RYAN (CONTD)
Explorer do you copy
Silence
Slowly the sun recedes further behind the earth and the
light
bathing Ryans face evaporates As she is swallowed by the
darkness she speaks once again
RYAN (CONTD)
Houston do you copy
THE WHOLE FACE OF THE EARTH IS IN SHADOW
And so is Ryan Her eyes dart It is utterly silent She
spins
in the darkness waiting
RYAN (CONTD)
Houston this is Mission Specialist
Ryan Stone Im off structure and Im
drifting
There is only the silence complete and absolute
RYAN (CONTD)
Do you copy
Nothing She watches the earth slip from view yet again
When next she speaks the words are as delicate as
snowflakes

tripping off her tongue like a prayer
RYAN (CONTD)
Anybody Anyone Please copy

A soothing light hits Ryans face
THE MOON is rising over the Pacific Ocean

Its almost full and its soft cool light pours over the

globe

brightening the deep blue waters and-

IN THE DISTANCE -

A LIGHT not bigger than a star is FLICKERING

Ryans eyes focus on the light Her PUPILS DILATE Something

like tears glistens as she stares at the flickering light

afraid to blink as she watches the

Star draw closer smiling as the faintest thread of a
radio

transmission stitches its way through the silence listening
as

STATIC SINGS through her helmet stinging her ears with the
sound of

Her name

RYAN
Oh Sorry

She slips the light back into her side pouch just as Matt
appears as if from nowhere and GRABS HER

MATT
Gotcha

RYAN
Arghh

Ryan holds on to Matt Instantly they begin to spin

together
Matt takes out a tether
MATT
Now Im going to tether you to me
Ryan is paralyzed holding onto Matt tightly and looking at
him

in fright He stares back

MATT (CONTD)
I know You never realized how
devastatingly good-looking I am

Matt grins

MATT (CONTD)
But I need you to stop staring and
help me with the tether Okay

RYAN
Okay Okay Okay Okay Ohh I got it

He runs the other end of the tether to the harness on Ryans
suit and attaches it

MATT
Ok So far so good Now listen Im
going to give you a little push just
so youre clear of the jets--

RYAN
No--

MATT
Sorry Not a push more like a nudge

RYAN
gentle

this

changing

does

No No No Wait Dont
Matt places his hand on her breastplate and gives her a
nudge Drifting again she begins to freak

RYAN (CONTD)
Nooooooo Dammit

The tether tenses and she stops nine feet away from Matt
Matt ignites the thrusters tugging Ryan behind him But
proves a difficult endeavor as her momentum drags him
his direction

MATT
See Where you go I go

Matt ignites a new thrust to re-direct his position As he
so Ryans change of momentum makes him swing again

MATT (CONTD)
Better Lets get out of here
Using his thrusters Matt negotiates a new position and
igniting a long thrust he jets away

Ryan cannot repress the anger boiling up and SHE SCREAMS-—

RYAN
Ahh Dammit

MATT
I know what you mean

RYAN
Ahhh Dammit

MATT
Youre burning oxygen were going to
go back to the shuttle Hows that for
a plan Copy

RYAN
FUCK

MATT
Right copy that

As Matt accelerates toward a lower orbit his momentum takes
over steadying Ryans swing

MATT (CONTD) (CONTD)

Houston in the blind this is
Kowalsky Dr Stone and I are making
our way to base please prepare
Airlock for arrival Copy

They descend gliding through pieces of debris Among the
space
junk a Solar Panel from the Hubble is distinguished

Matt eyes a small dot in the distance the Shuttle

MATT (CONTD)
Houston this is Kowalsky How do you
copy

RYAN
Why arent they answering

MATT
It seems like communications are lost

RYAN
Can they hear us on an alternate
frequency

MATT
We dont know Thats why we keep
talking If someone is listening they
might just save your life Set your
watch for ninety minutes

Matt reaches for a digital watch strapped to his wrist and
sets
up the timer for- 90 MINUTES

RYAN
Why ninety

MATT
Houston clocked that debris at fifty
thousand miles per hour Factoring in
our current orbit I reckon weve got
90 minutes before we play duck and
cover again

Ryan sets her watch studies the counter as it begins to
count

MATT
Okay Pretty scary shit being
untethered up here isnt it

RYAN
Yeah Pretty scary shit

MATT

(after a beat)
You did all right

Silence

MATT (CONTD)
(to the Shuttle)
Houston in the blind This is
Kowalsky Our current location is
approximately 900 meters out from the
Explorer Dr Stone and I would like
to retrieve the body of Mission
Specialist Shariff and return it to
Shuttle Am I a go to retrieve

Silence
MATT (CONTD)
Roger that
Matt changes direction and approaches Shariff He has to
several small thrusts to try and steady his direction

against Ryans momentum

RYAN
Where is he Where is he

Shariffs body is tethered to a PANEL that was ripped away

the Explorer Matt approaches the panel and ignites the
thrusters to slow down his course and-

He grabs onto it Ryan continuing her momentum crashes

Shariffs body The contact slows her trajectory but it

his

abandon

Shariff away his tether tensing pulling the panel with
RYAN (CONTD)
Oh my God Oh my God

Matt holding on to the metal spins with it He detaches
Shariffs tether from the panel and attaches it to himself

He lets the panel go and immediately ignites his thruster
pulling the two tethers behind him which as they tense

Ryan and Shariff closer together

MATT
Grab him

RYAN
Im trying Im trying

MATT
Quick Youre pulling me away

RYAN
I got him I got him

Matt tries to ignite a very long thrust in the direction of
Shuttle but this is difficult as the momentum of the other
bodies pulls him in all directions
MATT

Clutch him like hes your Valentine I

cant gauge my thrust with you two yo-

yoing around

Tentatively Ryan extends her right hand to grab onto
body harness And she sees-

Shariffs broken helmet A hole the size of a soft ball

through it and has left a tunnel of frozen dried bloody

Ryans face is inscrutable Finally she looks away but this
time something arrests her gaze

A LAMINATED PHOTOGRAPH floats next to Shariff tethered to

suit via a small chain In it a YOUNG BOY LAUGHS with
apparent

beyond

nose

cockpits

windows

happy in the embrace of a man unseen save for his TWO STRONG
ARMS Transfixed Ryan is unable to look away something
complicated confusing her eyes

The photograph floats in the empty space above Planet Earth

OUTER SPACE
As they approach the damage to the Shuttle becomes
Explorer has been badly hit

MATT
(under his breath)
Jesus

The Shuttle has suffered devastating damage The tail is

repair one wing is completely destroyed while the other
waffles weakly nearly sheared from the fuselage

MATT (CONTD)

(GRIMLY )
Heres hoping youve got one monster
insurance policy Houston Damages to
Explorer are its totaled Will
commence search for survivors

RYAN
02 down to five percent

Matt thrusts to slow down his trajectory and slowly bumps
against the windshield of the COCKPIT

At the mercy of Matts momentum Ryan hits hard against the
of the Shuttle losing her grip on Shariff

As she caroms off she grabs onto what is left of the

window

MATT
All right here we go Careful of the
edges

Matt takes his flashlight and looks through the broken
lighting the cockpit

Ryan pulls herself up and looks-
THROUGH THE WINDOW-

The cabin has been destroyed A disarray of objects smashed
and

devastated

At the end of the cabin among the floating objects a
lifeless

body drifts among the wreckage Ryan regards it silently

mesmerized

BANG

The face of a second astronaut appears right in front of
Ryan
and crashes against her visor

The eyes are frozen unblinking Ryan GASPS wheeling
backward
and away

Matt clicks Shariffs harness onto the Shuttle

MATT (CONTD)
Houston in the blind To confirm
Mission Specialist Dr Stone and
myself Mission Commander Matthew
Kowalsky are the sole survivors of
STS-157

Matt turns to Ryan who is staring at the dead astronauts
inside

RYAN
I apologize for not complying I
shouldve stopped working as soon as
you instructed me to

MATT
We were going to be hit no matter
what There was nothing you couldve
done to change that

He begins to reach out hesitates briefly then lightly
touches
her shoulder

MATT (CONTD)
Hey

RYAN
Yes
the

Space

She turns no elbows this time

MATT
Alright We have to get ourselves to
the Space Station There

Matt gestures vaguely to a bright dot in distance
MATT (CONTD)
Its a bit of a hike but its our

only
(CATCHING HIMSELF)

Its our best option Agreed
She stares at the dot

MATT (CONTD)
Dr Stone
(as she turns)
Agreed

She studies his face and then finally nods

RYAN
Agreed

MATT
Alright After you

He gently pushes her into space She slowly drifts away from
Explorer but is suddenly stopped by the safety tether

Matt ignites his propellers and giving a couple of small
thrusts he combats Ryans swing And with a LONGER THRUST-

He shoots forward pulling Ryan behind him

The two astronauts push forward together leaving behind the
shell of the Shuttle and the remains of the Hubble

MATT (CONTD)
Houston in the blind this is
owalsky Dr Stone and I have
determined to proceed to ISS and use
one of their Soyuz for re-entry ISS
if copy please send rescue mission
Repeat please dispatch rescue mission

They are heading toward a small point in the distance the

Station which is in a lower orbit
and

grows

Earths

light

smiles

OUTER SPACE 550 KM ABOVE EARTH
We see the two astronauts crossing the distance - a thrust

they coast ahead and then another thrust Matt pulls Ryan
behind him

Two specks glide across the dark sky as a sliver of light
on the darkened hemisphere

THE SUN IS RISING
WATCHING THE SUNRISE

THE SUN looks brighter and clearer than ever outside of
atmosphere The oceans and the continents brighten as its
spills over the Earth beneath them

Warm rays of sun caress the two astronauts as they propel
themselves across the empty expanse

RYAN
02 down to two percent

MATT
Were getting there

MATT (CONTD)
Beautiful dont you think

RYAN
What

MATT
The sunrise Thats what Im going to

miss the most

But Ryan is not into the view right now Shes stricken with
fear Her jaw is clenched and her eyes are almost closed

Matt looks at the dark emptiness that engulfs him and
MATT (CONTD)
So wheres home Dr Stone

Ryan keeps her eyes closed doesnt answer Matt trying to
DISTRACT HER-
MATT (CONTD)
Ryan Wheres home

Ryan opens her eyes but still she doesnt dare to look out
of
the helmet

RYAN
Home

MATT
Ah ha Down there Mother Earth Where
do you pitch your tent

RYAN
Lake Zurich

MATT
Where the hell is that

RYAN
Illinois

MATT
Illinois Central time zone That
makes it roughly 8pm right now
What are the good people of Lake
Zurich doing at 8 oclock in the
evening

Ryan tries to overcome her fear and looks out She frowns

terrified by the sight and hides her face once more inside
the

helmet

RYAN
I dont know

MATT
What would you be doing

She tries again This time she forces herself and stares out
at

the Earth which is over 500 kilometers below her

MATT (CONTD)
Come on Its 8 oclock Youve just
clocked out of the hospital after
putting in your customary 18-hour
shift Youre driving home
Ryans wide open eyes are transfixed on Earth like a deer
in
headlights

RYAN
The radio I listen to the radio

MATT
There we go Let me guess NPR
Classical Top for--

RYAN
Anything Doesnt matter As long as
they dont talk I just drive

Her glassy eyes reveal a strong emotion growing inside of

her
taking over her body It is not fear it is something deeper

and
more painful

Matt studies her curiously

MATT
What do you miss down there

Ryan looks at the Earth It never felt so far away
A long silence without an answer

MATT (CONTD)
Is there a Mr Stone

She frowns unable to comprehend this initially as if it

were a
particularly complicated bit of math then shakes her head

RYAN
No

MATT
Nobody special Someone down there
looking up thinking of you

Ryan closes her eyes She remains silent A silence that
cant
hide an unspeakable pain

RYAN
I had a daughter

Her eyes flutter then open She is frozen in this moment
as if
stunned
Her gaze shifts and finds-
Matt studying her in his MIRROR

MATT
What was her name

RYAN
Sarah She was four Stupidest thing-
a school trip to the swimming pool
She was playing tag- she slipped hit
her head and that was it She loved
tag Im sure she was laughing

She looks away toward Earth It looks small Remote

RYAN (CONTD)
When I received the call I was driving
and ever since thats what I do I
wake up I go to work and then I just
drive

Matt finally averts his eyes He rolls his wrist over
consults
the timer watching the numbers slowly count down

RYAN (CONTD)
02 down to one percent

MATT
Well well what dyou know I have
good news and bad news

RYAN
Uhuh

MATT
The good news is were five minutes
from the ISS and I know where
the Russians stash their vodka and
thats a good thing cus Im running
out of fumes Bad news is Im gonna be
ten minutes short of breaking
Anatolys record

SUDDENLY COMING FROM INSIDE RYANS HELMET-
BEEP BEEP BEEP

RYAN
Mmm Mmmm

MATT
What

RYAN
Im red lining My O02 tank pressure
is low

MATT

The tank may be empty but theres
still oxygen in your suit so sip
Ryan Dont gulp Its wine not beer
Sip Well get you there

She nods

MATT (CONTD)
Lets go

Matt gives Ryan a gentle push waiting until the tether goes
taut and-

He gives a SMALL THRUST to position himself in the right
direction

He holds this SINGLE THRUST for longer than all of the
previous
ones immediately gaining speed descending towards-

THE SPACE STATION-
Which is half a mile away and now all of its modules are
clearly visible It also becomes clear that-

IT WAS HIT BY THE DEBRIS

MATT (CONTD)
Houston in the blind we have visual of
the ISS Station must have been
evacuated because first Soyuz is
missing Second Soyuz exhibits surface
damage and chute has deployed Its
use as escape pod for re-entry to
Earth is impossible

The surface of a module is badly scratched and some solar
panels
have been ripped

THE SECOND SOYUZ becomes visible attached to the Stations
Docking Module A piece of red and white fabric floats
around
the spherical capsule
Ryans losing her breath

RYAN
Shouldnt we be turning Were
DRIFTING AGAIN--

MATT
Sip Ryan Sip Drifting is good We
want to drift I wasnt kidding about
those fumes This can has one or two
good thrusts left If were lucky

They approach the Space Station which is just ahead of them
and
a hundred meters below

Shes sweating and starts to hyperventilate

MATT (CONTD)
Steady

She looks down eyes the Station passing beneath them

MATT (CONTD)
Ready aim

It looks as though the Station is going to slip away
altogether

MATT (CONTD)
fire

Matt triggers his THRUSTER turning sharply Ryans
trajectory

carries her in a straight line until the tether tenses

breaking Matts direction

He fires again to counter her momentum

A VERY LONG THRUST sends both of them in the right
direction

straight down toward the Station but at great speed

The Station is getting very close and theyre going very
fast

Matt ignites the FRONTAL THRUSTER which begins to slow him
down but the thrust stops

Ryan following her own momentum begins to pass Matt
unable to

RYAN
Break You have to break

MATT
I cant Cans empty Were coming in
fast and were going to hit hard Grab
onto anything you can and hold tight
Just then Ryan CRASHES against the SOLAR PANEL but is

grab hold As she tumbles past the body of the Station

Matt misses the solar panels and COLLIDES against the

As he begins to drift past he reaches out and snares a

Ryan passes flying above him The tether tenses pulling

The momentum is to great and he LETS GO of the railing

Ryan floats over the roof of the Space Station trying to

hold of the handles and rods that stick out of the modules

shes floating too high

Shes quickly reaching the end of the Station there is only

handle left ahead her last chance before floating away into

black void

She extends her arm and GRABS the handle tightly for dear
AND-

SHE STOPS

Shes holding onto the handle

RYAN
I got it I got it

INSIDE THE HELMET-
She looks up and sees-
Matt is floating straight toward her and-

He COLLIDES against her For a moment they are face to face
only the glass of their headgear separates their faces
But she loses her grip on the handle and the impact projects
her
into the emptiness

Her drifting is intercepted by a Solar Panel She crashes
against it shattering it as Matt rolls above it

Ryan bounces down towards the Earth tensing the tether
pulling
Matt making him descend over the other side of the panel

The sharp edges of the broken panels cut the tether in two
RYAN (CONTD)

The tether broke Im detached Im

Im detached

MATT
Grab a hold Grab anything

Ryan is drifting away from the Station She sees the
infinite

black void ahead of her and-

HER FOOT GETS STUCK IN THE PARACHUTE

It becomes tangled in the strings and fabric slowing her
down

Ryan is panting her face covered in sweat She turns back
and
SEES-
Matt rolling drifting in her direction
She stretches out her arm
Matts arm is also outstretched
MATT (CONTD)
(AN EDGE)
Give me give me five here Ryan
Hes trying to make light of it but hes really struggling
to
reach her

Ryan stretches farther

Matts hand comes closer to hers
The tips of their fingers are almost touching

RYAN
Ive got you Ive got you--

The very tips of their fingers touch --
BUT THEY MISS

As Matt drifts past

MATT
Shit shit

RYAN
No No No Dont you No Dont you
Dont Dont NO
As the parachute tenses she STOPS

The tether attached to Matts suit passes two feet away from

her
AND-
Ryan grabs the tether It slides through her closed fist
until-
Her grip tightens and the tether STOPS
RYAN (CONTD)
Gotcha
Matts momentum is now pulling Ryan dragging her loose from
the

parachute

MATT
You have to let me go

RYAN
What No--

MATT
You have to

RYAN
No

MATT

Those ropes are too loose
Im pulling you with me You have to
let me go or we both die--
RYAN
Im not letting you go Were fine

Her leg slides through the loose rope and she floats further
out being snagged at the last minute by a tether around her
foot (We move from high-angle to low angle two shot) As
this
HAPPENS

MATT

Ryan
RYAN

Youre not going anywhere youre not
GOING ANYWHERE--

MATT
Its not up to you

Matt begins to unharness the tether

RYAN
Please dont do this

Matt has unhooked the tether and is holding it in his hand

RYAN (CONTD)
Please dont do this Please dont do
this

MATT
Youre going to make it Ryan

RYAN (0S)
No

He opens his hand letting go of the tether and BEGINS TO

FLOAT
AWAY

Relieved of Matts pull the parachute begins to retrieve
pulling Ryan closer to the Station

RYAN (CONTD)
I had you I had you

Matt drifts away from the Station into the empty space
Ryan bumps against the station pulled by the parachute and
she

twists and turns before finally grabbing hold of a rail

MATT
(ON RADIO)
Ryan do you copy Do you copy

An ALARM GOES OFF

RYAN
My CO2 alarm went off My CO2 alarm
went off

MATT

You need to board the station Can you
see the airlock

She turns looking for the Stations Airlock
MAT

Do you copy
(POV shot - beginning to blur)

RYAN
Yes Yes I see it I see it

MATT

(ON RADIO)
Good Thats where you want to go
Youre losing focus right

RYAN
Yes

MATT
Thats because youre breathing CO2
and youre losing consciousness You
need to board the Station

Her eyes flutter

MATT (CONTD)
(ON RADIO)
Move

Ryan blinks TURNS OFF the ALARM and begins climbing over a
module of the Station

RYAN
Ok

The transmission becomes weaker filled with STATIC

MATT
(ON RADIO)
Now listen to me That second Soyuz is
too damaged for re-entry
but its perfectly fine for a little
Sunday drive

RYAN
Sunday drive
MATT
(ON RADIO)
Look to the west You see that dot

in the distance That is the Chinese
Station Youre going to take the
Soyuz and cruise over there The
Chinese lifeboat is a Shenzou

RYAN

Ive never flown a Shenzhou--

MATT

(ON RADIO)
That doesnt matter Its re-entry
protocol is identical to the Soyuzs--

She nods already looking

RYAN
Ok

MATT
(ON RADIO)
Youve never flown a Soyuz either

RYAN
Only on a simulator

MATT
(ON RADIO)
So then you know

RYAN
I crashed it I--

MATT

(ON RADIO)
Its a Simulator Thats what its
designed for

RYAN
Every time I crashed the Simulator
every time
MATT

(ON RADIO)
Its not rocket science Just point
the damn thing at earth and
by this time tomorrow youll be back
in Lake Zurich with one hell of a
story to tell You copy Ryan You
copy

RYAN
Im going to take the Soyuz and come
get you

MATT
No youre not I have too much of a
head start That ship already sailed
RYAN

No Im coming to get you

MATT
Ryan youre going to have to learn to
let go

RYAN
But I

MATT

(ON RADIO)
I want to hear you say youre going to
make it

Ryan is struggling for breath

MATT (CONTD)

(ON RADIO)
Ryan Say it
RYAN
Im Im going to make it
MATT

Alright Keep going
Ryan stares at Matts tiny figure in the distance

MATT (CONTD)
What kind of name is Ryan for a girl

RYAN
Dad wanted a boy

MATT
Are you close to the airlock

RYAN
Not yet

MATT
Keep going

Ryan continues to the Airlock

MATT (CONTD)
So now that we have some distance
between us- youre attracted to me
arent you

RYAN
What

MATT
Well people say I have beautiful blue
eyes

RYAN
You you have beautiful you have
beautiful blue eyes

MATT
I have brown eyes that hurts

She looks at Matts figure receding

MATT (CONTD)
(ON RADIO)
You wanna know the good news

RYAN
What

MATT

(ON RADIO)
Im going to break Anatolys record
and I think mines going to stand for
a long long time

RYAN
No Im coming to get you

Ryan starts to respond then falters watching Matts figure
grow ever smaller

THE SAD CROONING of HANK WILLIAMS crackles through the dying
radio

RYAN
(in a daze)
Matt

Only static hisses

RYAN (CONTD)
Matt

Static again as Matt falls deeper into the distance

lost in a sea of white specks and-
The transmission ends

SILENCE

INSIDE THE HELMET-

Ryan is dizzy sweating and having trouble focusing She
MATT-

Nothing more than a dot

She stretches her hand toward him as if trying to touch him
with the tips of her fingers But the dot has already

into never-ending darkness

EVERYTHING IS BLURRED

Ryan is about to lose consciousness when-

A new ALARM GOES OFF

She takes one deep breath as she opens her eyes widely
If she doesnt move shell die

Ryan pulls herself forward reaching for a handle on the

She grabs it and reaches for another climbing her way

But shes losing focus

As her right hand is reaching for a handle everything
blur and she misses

INSIDE THE HELMET -

Her brain is shutting down from lack of oxygen She

open her eyes and mumbles words that are unintelligible
She reaches up again almost blindly Her hand grips the
and with one huge effort-

She sprints across the Docking Module swinging from handle
handle in one continual push until she reaches the-
AIRLOCK

She stops takes one deep breath and-

She turns the latch and OPENS the re-entry hatch
The hatch BLOWS OPEN as the air inside the cabin escapes

the vacuum almost throwing Ryan back into space but she

tightly onto the latch

She hangs outside trying to gasp the last breath of oxygen
inside her life system She sees her feet dangling against

emptiness of space and-

With one last effort she pulls herself into the airlock

AIRLOCK MODULE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION 500 KM ABOVE

As she enters she does a 180-degree flip As soon as her
are in she grabs onto the latch and-
CLOSES THE HATCH

She turns the latch and-

THE CABIN IS SEALED OFF

INSIDE THE HELMET-

Ryan is suffocating With very little oxygen and her body
intoxicated by the nitrogen in her blood her breathing is

coarse and painful

She can hardly keep her eyes open and she pushes herself
through the cabin an empty cylinder lit by two circular

lights She reaches the-

CONTROL PANEL a small computer with a screen that monitors
atmospheric and temperature levels inside the airlock

She presses a button on the panel and-

THE CABIN BEGINS TO PRESSURIZE

A low hissing sound can be heard as the tanks in the Station
begin pumping pure oxygen into the airlock The control

monitor shows the atmospheric levels slowly rising
INSIDE THE HELMET-

Ryan gasps for air but there is none

She stares at the red-orange-green graph on the control
showing the atmospheric levels It reads red Her pupils
to dilate as-

SOUND BEGINS TO SURFACE-
In the vacuum of space there was nothing to carry sound

but now sound begins to travel through the oxygen that
fills the cabin

The sounds are muffled like the sounds of the outside world
heard from within the womb

A beeping sound intermittently penetrates the airlock
and halting

The Control Systems graph slowly moves from red to orange

But that will have to do

With one sharp motion-

SHE TAKES OFF HER HELMET-

And pushes it from her head

She gasps for air and coughs

She contorts and shakes fighting to breath in the thin
atmosphere of the airlock Her helmet bounces around the

of the cabin floating

The beeping sound has become clearer and recognizable - it
alarm ringing out across the Station

Orange is turning to green Her lungs begin to absorb the
and her breath becomes more even Her body floats relaxed
the confined space of the airlock

SHE FLOATS

Ryan brings her hands together and removes one glove

And then the other

Desperately she begins to unscrew the lock near her waist
squirms under the suit and pushes off the upper half

Then she throws off the lower half squirming out of it as

shedding her old skin desperate to free herself from the
claustrophobia of the suit

Wearing only underwear and a t-shirt she floats in mid-air
relieved and exhausted The hum of the Space Station

Then slowly she pulls her knees to her chest and enfolds

in her arms floating in a fetal position

OUTER SPACE 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH

SILENCE

The International Space Station with its modules its torn
solar panels and the Soyuz with its parachute billowing out
from its center is dwarfed against Earths orb and the
universe stretching out beyond

The Station looks frail and secluded lost somewhere between

grandness of the Heavens and the Earth below

Everything is still

INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION ZVEZDA MODULE
The module is like a wide corridor filled with cabinets a

eating area and a small gym A HUM reverberates across the
station

At the end of the module there is an open circular hatch

INTO THE-

UNITY NODE 1

A spherical space with three hatches each leading into
different modules

A HATCH OPENS and-

Ryan floats in She stops at the center and holds onto a

There are sleeping bags fastened to the walls Clothes

chaos around the module

Its clear that someone left in a hurry

Ryan passes a stationary bicycle and reaches for a metal

on the wall
She OPENS drawers looking for something

RYAN
Come on come on

She finds what shes looking for a BAG OF WATER with a
one end She unscrews the top and begins to drink from it
She DRINKS in long gulps squeezing the bottle trying to
her thirst DROPS FLOAT out of her mouth as the water

They float around her face like perfect pearls of different
sizes

She takes a pause from drinking to catch her breath The

is cooling her down but she still takes another long
gulp and empties the bag

She checks the count on the STOPWATCH- 14 minutes and
down

She takes a new bag of water from the drawer and pushing
herself off of a wall she dives into the-

UNITY NODE 2-
RYAN (CONTD)
OK Where are you Where are you
Comms Comms There you are

Without stopping she goes through one of the open hatches

THE-

ZVEZDA MODULE
The walls are filled with electrical equipment and wires
Without slowing down her momentum she floats to the-

MAIN CONSOLE- A large deck which houses all of the
communication
and navigational systems

On the opposite wall there is a LARGE PORTHOLE through which
Earth is clearly seen

She begins to PUSH BUTTONS

COMPUTERS COME TO LIFE and Ryan puts on a communications
headset

STATIC CRACKLES

RYAN
Matt This is Ryan Copy
She waits

RYAN (CONTD)
Matt This is Ryan Copy

Nothing only static

RYAN (CONTD)
Matt I made it Im here Im inside

She drifts along the module listening intently through the
headset

RYAN (CONTD)
Come on Matt Talk to me

Give me your position

No voices Just static
RYAN (CONTD)

Where are you Give me a visual
tell me what you see

Nothing
RYAN (CONTD)

Oh come on Youve been yammering
nonstop since we left Cape Canaveral
and now you decide to shut up
She waits ONE SECOND TWO SECONDS-

RYAN (CONTD)
Come on Matt talk to me

The signal cuts in and out but remains indecipherable
There is
something unnerving about it

She drops her head and continues drifting toward the
porthole
listening as the STATIC SPUTTERS

RYAN (CONTD)
Say something Anything

RYAN (CONTD)
Tell me about Mardi Gras Tell me
about the hairy guy What happened
Waiting for him to respond and in a softer voice
completely
RESIGNED-

RYAN (CONTD)
Oh Matt Im not ready for this

She bumps against the PORTHOLE and glances out-

The Earth glimmers brightly A third of the hemisphere is in
complete darkness Her FACE REFLECTED in the glass is
SUPERIMPOSED over the EARTH

Her eyes glisten briefly but she fights it back Then she
pulls
herself together and begins reporting-

RYAN (CONTD)
Houston in the blind

Outside the Aurora Borealis performs its ghostly dance over
Earths Northern Hemisphere

An ALARM CHIRPS RED LIGHTS FLICKERING across the module

Ryan twists swimming back to the control panel studying a
FLASHING grid of LEDS

GRAPH OF THE STATION-

-where a blinking light indicates the Japanese Module IS

FIRE
RYAN (CONTD)
What now
AND THEN-
The Destiny Lab begins blinking
THE FIRE IS EXPANDING

She pushes herself toward the hatch swimming through the

pieces of paper still hovering as she exits into the-

UNITY NODE 1

The ALARMS STACCATO is blasting in synchrony with the
lights blinking across the station

SMOOTH BLUE FLAMES ribbon eerily across the skin of the

Lab They are spreading expanding with a dense cloud of
the

Ryan enters and snatches a FIRE EXTINGUISHER on the wall of
module and-

She points the nozzle at the fire and SPRAYS

With no gravity to hold her down the force of the spray
HER FLYING BACK and-

SHE CRASHES AGAINST A WALL The fire extinguisher bangs

her face and CUTS HER LIP

The impact is so strong that it almost knocks her out Her
fill with tears but she reacts

Theres no time to lose She fastens her feet to a strap on

floor and-

SPRAYS the extinguisher at the fire But the extinguisher is
match for the fire which has gathered in a gigantic smooth
ball and is expanding coming at her

Ryan makes a fast turn and launches herself in the opposite
direction into the-

UNITY NODE-
Dashing straight into the-
ZARYA MODULE-
She darts across the module behind her-

The expanding fire ball has swallowed the Unity Node and is
making its way towards her chasing her into the-

UNITY NODE 2-
Where she makes a quick turn and darts down into the-
DOCKING MODULE-

Just in time Above her the flames cross the Node as they
spread into the rest of the Station

They quickly spread downward into the Docking Module

Ryan the flames caressing her feet dives through a hatch

THE-

SOYUZ AIRLOCK

Ryan crashes against a Space Suit floating inside and turns
close the hatch

THE FIRE is spreading outside in the module sucking the
out of the Soyuz An incandescent blue bubble that charges
her

Ryan faster than fire CLOSES THE HATCH

THE SOYUZ IS SEALED OFF

She closes a second hatch and the Soyuz is safe

She exhales in RELIEF

A RUMBLE in the Station makes the Soyuz quake

The extinguisher is blocking her path to the hatch and Ryan

to push it into the cabin as she darts toward the-

SOYUZ CONTROL CABIN
As soon as she makes it through the hatch she TURNS the

LIGHTS ON

There is just enough space for three astronauts to sit
surrounded by the CONTROL PANEL that navigates the vessel

She sits down in the command chair

She fastens the safety belt and looks around trying to
recognize the different buttons on the panel which are all
labeled in Russian

RYAN

RYAN (CONTD)
Rezerv rasstyk

The SOUND of a mechanism releasing reverberates throughout

vessel

OUTER SPACE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION 500 KM ABOVE

SILENCE

A SPRING MECHANISM pushes the Soyuz away from the Station
SLOWLY

VERY SLOWLY

The Spacecraft is made out of three modules- the ENGINE the
CONTROL CABIN and the AIRLOCK at the front

SOYUZ CONTROL CABIN

Detached from the Space Station the rumbling has ceased
leaving only the gentle hum of the cabin

ON THE PERISCOPE-

The distance between the Soyuz and the Docking Module grows
little by little as the vessel drifts away from it

Ryan sits tensely and checks the manual and-

She presses different buttons bringing to life a new set of
systems

RYAN
I engaged manual control- ROA K and
RYD are activated
She grabs the joysticks with her hand and-

OUTER SPACE 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH

The lateral thrusters give a small thrust and as the

spacecraft

floats

the

though-

crash

moves away from the Station it drags its parachute which
lifelessly in space
ANOTHER BIGGER THRUST and as the Soyuz pulls away from the

Station the parachutes ropes tense and-

A BIG JOLT

SOYUZ CONTROL CABIN
Her seat belts prevent her from being projected forward as
Soyuz is pulled to a sudden stop

Ryan is very confused unaware of the reason for the sudden
stop She looks at-

THE PERISCOPE-
The Station is drifting out of the scopes sight
She turns to-

THE PORTHOLE-
And through the glass she sees that-

The Station is coming straight at her and it looks as

THEYRE ABOUT TO COLLIDE

RYAN
Oh no No no no

She presses the joystick

OUTER SPACE 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH
The Soyuz is two meters away from the Station about to

WHEN-

collision

it

are

entwined

with

swimming

The SOFT JETS ignite launching the vessel upwards

The Soyuz skims just over the Docking Module and passes
inches away from the solar panels barely avoiding a
with the metal giant

And as the Soyuz drifts upwards the Station passes under

SOYUZ CONTROL CABIN
Now Ryan can see through-

THE PORTHOLE-
The parachute is tangled with a solar panel and the ropes

tensing up and-

SHES SHAKEN BY A NEW PULL

OUTER SPACE 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH
The Soyuz stabilizes over the Station the parachute

with the solar panel

SOYUZ CONTROL CABIN
She looks out at-
THE PORTHOLE-
The rope extends from the cabin to the parachute tangled
the Station

RYAN
Great Fantastic Perfect

OUTER SPACE 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH
SILENCE

The Station hovers below the Soyuz like a large whale
space

floating

Williams

in

around

the

beneath a tiny lifeboat

The HATCH of the Soyuz OPENS

Ryan comes out of the craft into space Shes wearing the
suit she packed and she carries a large bag

She holds onto handles as she floats SAFELY TETHERED to the
inside of the cabin

She LOOKS around-
The International Space Station is a looming presence

ten meters below It is pulling the Soyuz by its parachute

An ALARM on her STOPWATCH RINGS Its been 85 MINUTES
She turns the alarm off and looks around
RYAN
Clear skies but with a chance of
satellite debris
SHE HUMS A SONG the tune is reminiscent of the Hank
Melody that Matt had played earlier

She begins to climb around the vessel With plenty of oxygen

her pressurized suit this is not a difficult task

She pulls herself from handle to handle making her way

the Soyuz and reaching-
THE PARACHUTE CONTAINER-
An impact has blown open the cover Three ropes float out of

container into space Three meters away from the vessel each
rope branches into dozens of parachute strings Next to it-

A second cover is also badly damaged

Harnessing herself to a handle she inspects the ropes The
three ropes are bolted to the containers frame

RYAN (CONTD)
Okay We detach this and we go home
Piece of cake
She harnesses the bag and RESUMES her HUMMING louder this

time

She unzips the bag and takes out the PISTOL GRIP tool
without

noticing that behind her-

DOZENS OF PIECES OF DEBRIS pass zooming less than thirty
meters

away from the Station

A tiny piece of high-speed debris crashes against one of the
Stations Solar panels shattering it and causing the
Station to

tremble

She places the tool against the FIRST BOLT stretching her
arm

into the parachute container It is an awkward position

She pulls the trigger and the drill rotates turning the
bolt

but it slides out of the notch

She places the tool once more against the bolt and pulls the

trigger The drill rotates SLOWER this time

She HUMS under her breath and SWEAT begins to drop down her

forehead

She is very focused unaware that behind her-

DEBRIS HITS THE STATIONS SOLAR PANEL piercing holes
through

it

THE BOLT COMES OFF

As it FLOATS OFF into space Ryan drops the PISTOL GRIP and
uses

both hands to detach the rope from the frame

The ROPE FLOATS away from the Soyuz undulating like a long

snake but-

Ryan notices that the Pistol Grip is also floating away

She stretches her arm trying to catch it but it is out of
her

reach

She pushes herself towards the pistol grip and barely
manages
from

with

crash

now

to grab onto it when she sees-

RYAN (CONTD)
Oh shit

THE TIDE OF DEBRIS is floating STRAIGHT AT HER
She pulls herself back to the container
DEBRIS HITS THE STATION

It CRASHES in SILENCE against one of its modules creating a
hole the size of a car wheel The vacuum sucks BLUE FLAMES

the station that quickly die without oxygen to consume

Ryan brings the pistol-grip to the SECOND BOLT and pulls the
trigger The bolt spins

Ryan is HUMMING louder and louder

Ryan stares intently at the head of the bolt turning as the
debris zooms by behind her

THE SECOND BOLT COMES OFF

She quickly pulls the rope loose from the frame and lets it
float away

Shaken by the impacts the Space Station drags the Soyuz
it

She braces herself as-

DEBRIS WREAKS HAVOC- some pieces hit the Station others

against one another Each collision creates more debris that
ricochet and fly away in all directions

The Soyuz is pulled by the remaining parachute rope as the
Station spins out of control

Ryan starts humming even louder the bravado is full tilt

Her face is now covered in sweat which pours into her eyes
making it difficult to see as she unscrews the last bolt

Behind her a cluster of debris PIERCES THE PARACHUTE

Ryan continues drilling as-
MORE DEBRIS HIT THE STATION

It CRASHES against the Japanese Lab which silently EXPLODES
into millions of pieces The pieces expand away from the
Station

THE LAST BOLT COMES OFF

Ryan manages to unhook the rope freeing the Soyuz from the
collapsing Space Station

She braces herself against the vessel as she sees-—

RYAN (CONTD)
Shit

The Soyuz is heading straight towards the Stations Solar
Panels

RYAN (CONTD)
No no no

The Soyuz Solar Panel collides with the Stations
shattering

into smaller pieces of debris that almost hit Ryan

The Soyuz spins away as-

MORE DEBRIS HITS THE STATION

Ryan watches as a succession of satellite fragments pepper

the

slowly revolving Station segments As the segments crumble

colliding with additional debris the fragments glimmer

magnificently then join

the THINNING TIDE OF DEBRIS orbiting toward the dark side
of

the Earth All of a sudden

EVERYTHING IS CALM

She pauses blinking into the suddenly empty distance Her
gaze

remains fixed on the vast nothingness--for no good reason--
but

nevertheless FIXED on something

RYAN (CONTD)
I hate space
SOYUZ SPACECRAFT CONTROL CABIN
A SYMPHONY OF ALARMS shrieks loudly The hatch FLIES open

and a
helmet floats in followed quickly by Ryan
RYAN
Shut up
She presses different buttons and with each a voice of the
alarm symphony dies until they are completely silent
RYAN (CONTD)
Ok
She takes a breath and begins fastening the seat belt
RYAN (CONTD)
Alright Thats good
She puts on the communication headset and-
Resets the STOPWATCH- 85 minutes and counting down
She checks the TEMPERATURE GAUGE-
She exhales the plume of her hot breath hanging briefly in
the
frigid cabin air before evaporating
RYAN (CONTD)
Okay lets stabilise you
She takes the JOYSTICK
Ryan looks focused at-
THE PERISCOPE-
Where the western horizon comes into frame and nears the
center

crosshair
A small dot GLIMMERS in the distance- THE CHINESE STATION

RYAN (CONTD)
Ok Lets visit the Chinese station
Houston in the blind Tiangong is
approximately 100km to the west and I
am off its course by about 3 degrees
I will correct trajectory

She moves the Joystick and the crosshair readjusts
RYAN (CONTD)
Ok
She releases the safety lock and places her finger on the
button
RYAN (CONTD)
Ok Ill engage main thrust in five
four three

She releases the safety lock

RYAN (CONTD)
two one

She pushes on the button

OUTER SPACE 300 KM ABOVE EARTH

The Soyuz floats with its nose directed towards a bright

star on
the horizon the Chinese Station but-
Nothing not even a small flame comes out of its back
thrusters
CONTROL CABIN
Ryan waits expectantly and gives the button a NEW PUSH
but-
RYAN
One
Nothing The thruster wont ignite
RYAN (CONTD)
One one
OUTER SPACE 300 KM ABOVE EARTH
The vessel remains motionless orbiting over the Pacific
which

is already under nights dark veil

CONTROL CABIN

She pushes again and again and again-
RYAN
Come on Come on

OUTER SPACE 300 KM ABOVE EARTH

But NOTHING
The Soyuz stays in place

CONTROL CABIN
Ryan looks at the FUEL GAUGE- 30 percent
She taps on it and the frozen needle drops to EMPTY

RYAN
You gotta be kidding me

She taps on the frozen dial once more as if trying to get
the
needle to go back up and once again-

RYAN (CONTD)
Wheres your backup

She taps even harder this time

RYAN (CONTD)
Wheres your goddamn backup

She bangs down on the control panel in frustration--

RYAN (CONTD)
FU--

OUTER SPACE 300 KM ABOVE EARTH

Inside the capsule through the portal Ryan hits and hits

bouncing around the confined space of the cabin and venting
all

her anger until she herself is out of fuel

She grabs the radio and-

RYAN
This is Dr Ryan Stone can you hear
me Houston this is Ryan Stone can
you hear me Copy Houston this is
Ryan Stone can you hear me Copy
THE SUN SETS

A magical cosmic act As the sun nears the edge of the

Earth
the atmosphere brightens shining with a luminous orange
light
that is reflected off the surface of the Pacific Ocean
At the Soyuzs orbiting speed this does not last long The
sun
quickly dips behind the edge of the Earth and the whole face
of
the planet is in shadow
The vessel is almost lost in the deep black of night
Fluorescent green light pours out of the porthole like a
lonely
firefly lost in the deep of night
CONTROL CABIN
And the night has brought with it its cold grip
Ryan shivers and her voice is now weak but she continues
searching for help-
RYAN
Houston this is Ryan Stone can you
hear me Copy Houston this is Ryan
Stone can you hear me Copy
She turns her neck stiffly looks at the-
TEMPERATURE DIAL -8 degrees and dropping Through the
PORTHOLE
the SUN drops DARKNESS descends
Finally a SOUND SURFACES through the static
A CRACKLING
The CRACKLING SOUND is coming from the communication
headset

Ryan puts it on and brings the mouthpiece to her lips
RYAN (CONTD)
Houston Houston This is Mission

Specialist Ryan Stone Do you copy

This glimmer of hope gives her a new burst of energy
She TURNS ON THE CABIN LIGHT and attempts to tune into the
frequency turning one of the control panels dials She
frowns

RYAN (CONTD)

Fragmented words emerge through the static

The barking of several dogs can be heard behind the mans

Ryan begins to HOWL giving in to the mad joy of it all
Moments later through the RADIO she is joined by a CHORUS

CANINES--Aningangs DOGS--TUNING INTO HER VOICE in a mad
harmonic cacophony Ryan smiles blissfully happy howling
abandon

Each howling reaches deeper and is more cathartic unlocking
emotions that have been festering over time and-

TEARS ROLL FROM HER EYES clear as crystals spilling from
lashes and floating INTO THE AIR glimmering LIKE SAPPHIRES
the cool moonlight
They float away like tiny satellites orbiting her face
Aningang can be heard intermittently YELLING as if trying
silence the dogs Then the dogs one by one cease their
and Ryan is left with nothing but her own voice
She stops gazing at her tears suspended in the gloomy blue
light
RYAN
Im going to die Aningang
The SIGNAL ebbs losing its battle with the STATIC
RYAN (CONTD)
I mean were all going to die
Everyone knows that But Im going to
die today

The STATIC waffles in and out

RYAN (CONTD)
Funny that To know

The STATIC breaks and Aningangs HUSKY VOICE begins SINGING

RYAN (CONTD)
And you know what Aningang I dont
care I dont care if I die I dont
have anything not anymore
Ryan is floating now over her seat

RYAN (CONTD)
But the thing is Im still scared
Im really scared

She rolls in space and stares upwards

RYAN (CONTD)
No one will mourn me No one will pray
for my soul Will you mourn me
Aningang Is it too late to say a
prayer Id say one for myself but I
have never prayed in my life no one
ever taught me how

The tune is lyrical and soothing tinged with a touch of
melancholy

RYAN (CONTD)
No one ever taught me how

Ryan listens to Aningangs melody and smiles softly closing
her
eyes

Ryans face grows slack as she drifts toward
unconsciousness
buoyed along on Aningangs sad soulful song Then

a SPUTTERING CRY cuts through the static

A BABY
Ryans eyes pop open

RYAN (CONTD)
A baby Theres a baby with you

A beat Aningang stops singing speaking in a soft voice

TRANSMISSION
Teukpalliktuq upatimi

RYAN
You are singing to your baby Is that
a lullaby Thats so sweet

Ryan is transfixed listening to the gentle gurgle of the
baby
as Aningang coos to it then begins to SING again
RYAN (CONTD)
I used to sing to my baby too

Painful memories flash before her haunting her Ryans lump
in

her throat is washed away by a gentle sob

RYAN (CONTD)
I hope I see her soon

She reaches for a valve and opens it

A HIZZING sound is heard inside the vessel and-

ON THE SCREEN-

The Oxygen in the cabins atmosphere begins to drop
SHE TURNS OFF THE LIGHT

Ryan closes her eyes simply listening to the lullaby as it
grows fainter

RYAN (CONTD)

(growing ever drowsier)

Thats nice Keep singing Aningang
just like that Sing me to sleep Ill
sleep and sleep and sleep Sing to me
Aningang Singsing
The transmission grows fainter
and fainter

and then is

gone

For a long beat Ryan merely sits there She is gently
humming a

tune

It is a LULLABY

SHE SURRENDERS

SHE WEEPS

A quiet deep sorrow that silently grows in intensity and
that

finally explodes into-

A SOFT WAIL
to

on

inside

TEARS float around her like tiny satellites
The cold and the gentle humming of the Soyuz cradles Ryan
She closes her eyes and as her breathing relaxes she begins
fall asleep until-
CLICK CLICK CLICK
Ryan opens her eyes startled
CLICK CLICK CLICK
Ryan turns in confusion and looks at-
THE PORTHOLE-
THROUGH THE GLASS the helmet of an astronaut is looking in
IT IS MATT
He knocks once more this time louder
CLICK CLICK CLICK
Ryan is still drowsy and does not understand what is going
when she sees that-
The latch on the porthole begins to move

RYAN (CONTD)
No no dont

But the latch continues to open
Ryan immediately straps herself to the commander chair
The latch keeps turning

Ryan covers her eyes and face with her hands when-
THE LATCH RELEASES and

THE HATCH SWINGS OPEN

The VACUUM of space sucks in one sharp gust all the air

the cabin and with it every sound
hatch

The straps hold Ryan back as objects gush out through the
Her hands press tightly covering her face

On the Control Panel alarms begin to flash

A SHADOWY FIGURE makes its way in and with one sharp motion-
Turns and closes the hatch Presses a green button and-

The cabin begins to pressurize

And sound re-emerges with the beeping of the alarms as-

The red-orange-green graph on the control panel show the
atmospheric levels reaching green

Ryan uncovers her face and stares from the shadows at the
figure who straps into the seat next to her He unlocks the
ring around his collar and-

TAKES OFF HIS HELMET

COUNTRY WESTERN MUSIC escapes into the cabin

MATT
Ahhhh Alright check your watch 13
hours 11 minutes Call Anatoly tell
him hes been bumped

The figure glances around
MATT (CONTD)
Bit gloomy in here How “bout a little
light
He taps a few buttons on the console and a face blooms

Matt

Ryan stares mouth agape

RYAN

How did you
MATT

Trust me its a hell of a story
RYAN

But how did you

He reaches out and effortlessly flicks a myriad array of
switches Instantly the alarms go silent
MATT
Thats better

RYAN
How

Ryan looks at him wide eyed wanting to know how-

MATT
I found a little extra battery power
Im just happy youre still alive To
be honest I thought your chances were
slim to none By the way did you find
the vodka

RYAN
You never told me where

Matt fishes a SMALL FLASK from under his seat spins off the
cap

MATT
Oh well To Anatoly Na zdorovje

and takes a big gulp He offers the flask to Ryan who
appears to be dozing off She blinks shakes her head

RYAN
No

He studies her

MATT
No Right lets get out of here

He looks at the monitors where the Chinese Station is seen
MATT (CONTD)

Were ‘bout a hundred miles to the
Chinese Station A little Sunday

drive

RYAN
We cant

MATT
Course we can

RYAN

Theres no fuel I tried everything

MATT
Well theres always something we can
do

RYAN
I tried everything

MATT
Did you try the soft landing jets

RYAN
Theyre for landing so

MATT
Well landing is launching its the
same thing didnt you learn about
that in training

RYAN
I never got to land the simulator I
told you

MATT

But you know about it

RYAN
And I crashed it every time

Ryan is falling asleep Matt studies her as she dozes off

MATT
Listen you want to go back or do you
want to stay here I get it its nice
up here you can just shut down all
the systems turn out all the lights
and just close your eyes and tune out
everybody

Matt starts flipping through buttons on the console turning
the
cabin lights off

MATT (CONTD)
Theres nobody up here who can hurt
you its safe Then whats the point
in going on whats the point of
living

When the cabin is in darkness he turns and looks at Ryan
MATT (CONTD)
Your kid died doesnt get any rougher
than that but still its a
matter of what you do now If you

Ryan is having trouble keeping her eyes open

RYAN
How did you get here

MATT
Ryan you have to learn to let go
Hey

Ryan is almost sound asleep

RYAN
What

Ryan is asleep

MATT
Its time to go home

Her eyes snap open

Her gaze shifts The flask is floating in front of her
Matt She turns THE CABIN IS EMPTY She turns back
CLICK CLICK CLICK

Ryan notices that the gate of the ventilation duct is

making a percussive sound

But

A SOFT COOL LIGHT shines in through the condensation that

frozen on the glass It is-
THE MOONLIGHT caressing Ryans face
RYAN

Landing landing Landing is
launching

With a new surge of determination she TURNS ON THE CABIN

She pulls the HELMET floating above her and puts it on

She connects the umbilical to her suit opens the Oxygen
and begins to breath
As the Oxygen flows back into her brain a new surge of

determination brightens her face

She opens the valves of the other two umbilicals allowing
Oxygen to flow pressurizing the cabin

She grabs the MANUAL

RYAN (CONTD)
Okay landing landing landing is

She opens the green binder and browses through its index

RYAN (CONTD)
Okay okay landing alright

She stops turns some pages and stares closely at the

Ryan notices the Energy Bar floating by her She grabs it
she opens the wrapper she stares intently at one page of
MANUAL where there is-

A DIAGRAM-
An ILLUSTRATION of the Soyuz Capsule two meters before

bottom cushioning its fall THE SOFT LANDING ENGINES

RYAN (CONTD)
Soft landing jets trigger
automatically at three meters before
landing youre a clever son of a
bitch Matt So to land I need to get
rid of the BO and Engine module okay

She puts on the communication headset

RYAN (CONTD)
Listen to me Matt Youre going to see
a girl with brown hair Shes Sarah
her hair is probably a mess Thats
okay she doesnt like to brush it
She looks out of the porthole down at Earth

RYAN (CONTD)
Tell her mommy found her red shoe She
was so upset about that shoe Matt but
tell her it was right under the bed

She turns back to the console and places her finger over one
of
the buttons
RYAN (CONTD)
You give her a big hug and a kiss for
me and tell her mamma misses her Tell
her shes my little angel and that she
makes me so proud so so so proud and
that I promise Ill try and make her
proud too You tell her that Im not

Ryan scans through the complicated charts and diagrams in
the
manual

RYAN
Okay Houston here comes the tricky
part the Soyuz has to think were
only three meters above the earth
A pause and then-

RYAN (CONTD)
Lets reset you then

Using the manual as a reference Ryan uses the cursors to
select
the ALTITUDE DISPLAY on the computer screen

The current ALTITUDE is- 2600 M
She uses the cursors and presses a button A WARNING on the

computer screen comes on
She presses another button and-

ON THE SCREEN the ALTITUDE goes blank
Ryan punches a new set of commands
The ALTITUDE now reads- 3 meters

A THREE SECOND THRUST ignites at the back of the cabin
pushing

it at great speeds toward the Chinese Station

SOYUZ CONTROL CABIN

The strength of the thrust pushes Ryan back in her seat

She looks at-

THE PERISCOPE-

The Soyuz is approaching the Tiangong The center of the
crosshair is aiming three degrees above the Chinese Station

OUTER SPACE

The Soyuz is making its way rapidly towards the Chinese

CONTROL CABIN
Ryan is looking out of the window at Earth-

RYAN
Wow you were right Matt its
magnificent

She then turns to-

THE PERISCOPE-
The Chinese Station quickly grows in size as the Soyuz
closer and closer

ALTITUDE DIAL- 155 km and dropping

RYAN (CONTD)

Youre losing altitude Tiangong You
eep dropping and youre going to kiss
the atmosphere But not before I get
to you You have my last ride home

A new sense of urgency comes up on Ryans face

She unhooks the umbilical from her suit

She unstraps herself

She floats over and looks out of-

THE PORTHOLE-

The Chinese Station is approaching getting closer

She disarms the emergency exit and holds on to the LATC
She pauses and turns to grab the fire extinguisher and
tightly against her chest with one arm With the other

She reaches for the Latch

The Station is hovering right next to her and the cabin

RYAN (CONTD)
Okay Im done with just driving
Lets get go home
She turns the latch and-
PYROTECHNICS shoot the porthole into space
The brutal force of the infinite VACUUM of space SUCKS THE
out of the cabin and-

Ryan is LAUNCHED out of the cabin at a tremendous speed

SHE HITS HER SHOULDER as she goes through the hatch into-

OUTER SPACE
A CANNONBALL WOMAN is launched up from the Soyuzs hatch
passes the Chinese Station as she twirls up toward the
The Soyuz continues its straight trajectory toward Earth

INSIDE THE HELMET-

Ryan is stunned from the impact and her shoulder is in pain
OUTSIDE-

Everything twirls
Earth and Heavens

An ALARM in her STOPWATCH RINGS Its been EIGHTY-FIVE

And she spins and sees-

THE TIANGONG one mile below her And below it-

A bright comet leaves behind a yellow scratch over the

THE SOYUZ BURNING upon contact with the atmosphere

Ryan drifts away She holds tightly to the fire extinguisher
with one hand and with the other she checks her right

Soyuz

IT HURTS
But theres no time the Tiangong is getting farther away

points the nozzle of the fire extinguisher away from her and
TRIGGERS A-

SPRAY-

It acts like a thrust that pushes her toward the Station It
helped but she is still off target

INSIDE THE HELMET-
She is in pain
The glass visor is steaming up
She begins HUMMING as she looks at-
The Station drifting ahead less than five hundred meters
From this distance the damage caused to the Tiangong by the
debris is clear The solar panels are shredded to pieces
several modules appear to have been badly hit

RYAN GIVES-

ANOTHER SPRAY-
Propelling herself even closer to the Station

INSIDE THE HELMET-

She stops humming Her breath is fogging up the glass

her a blurred view of-

The Station which is less than a hundred meters away She
SEE THAT-

The LIFEBOAT the SHENZHOU a vessel very similar to the

is docked on a module

Its now clear that shes not flying straight toward the
Station

Ryan attempts to correct her trajectory by giving-
ANOTHER SPRAY-

But only a very SMALL THRUST comes out of the extinguisher

not

enough to push her on the right track

She PULLS the trigger again-

But only a few dust particles come out The extinguisher is

empty She lets go of it and it floats away

She drifts toward the Station SLOWLY

She is less than twenty meters away and getting closer

AND CLOSER

And she misses it by a hair

She drifts very slowly two meters above the Station

Her arm outstretched tries to grab hold of anything it
can

INSIDE THE HELMET-

Ryan winces in pain and looks at-

Her outstretched arm reaching toward-

THE STATION-

She slowly drifts across the modules the tips of her
fingers

almost touching the surface of the Tiangong

A handle passes under her almost within reach but she does
not

manage to hold onto it

INSIDE THE HELMET-

Shes struggling but she knows shes not going to make it
She

looks ahead at-

THE STATION-

A solar panel following the rotation of the Station comes

into

view

She stretches out her arm as she gets closer to it
momentum

to

its

rod

far

But the solar panel continues its rotation and she is
approaching very slowly

The panel is rotating away
She STRETCHES and-

She GRABS onto a rod on the Solar Panel STOPPING her

Ryan hangs from the Station She holds her right arm tightly
her chest
INSIDE THE HELMET-
She catches her breath and is clearly in pain
RYAN SEES-
A LONESOME PIECE OF DEBRIS
It hovers above the Station and glows as the sunlight hits
surface It passes very quickly
And theres ANOTHER ONE cruising farther above
She pulls her right arm up

RYAN
Ahhhhhh

The pain is excruciating but she grabs onto the panels

AND-

SHE PULLS HERSELF UP and clinging with her leg she secures
herself to the panel

INSIDE THE HELMET-

Shes panting and through the fogged up glass she can see
away over the horizon-

BRIGHT DOTS

Pieces of debris burn as they hit the atmosphere A swarm of

incandescent locusts that-

Is coming directly at her
possible

she climbs up to-

THE BODY OF THE STATION

She goes over the module and makes her way across pulling

herself from handle to handle

When she reaches the end of it with one last BIG PULL she
makes

it to the-

HATCH that leads into the airlock

With her bad arm she holds onto a handle

With the other she pulls on the latch and-

OPENS THE AIRLOCK

A gust of AIR bursts out pushing the hatch wide open

Ryan holds on tightly to the handle

ABOVE HER-

Clusters of DEBRIS pass by flying at different distances
and at

great speeds

Pieces COLLIDE with each other exploding into more debris

A BIG PIECE OF DEBRIS is flying downward missing the
Station by

Ignoring her pain but using her right arm as little as

ten meters as it continues its descent And-

250 meters below it BURNS like a shooting star

The Station is rapidly approaching Earths atmosphere
And over the Eastern horizon-

A CLOUD OF DUST is quickly approaching

THE TIDE OF DEBRIS

TIANGONG AIRLOCK 150 KM ABOVE THE EARTH

Ryan secures the hatch
The airlock is smaller than the one in the International

Space

Station but like the ISS there is a small control panel on
one

side

INSIDE THE HELMET-

The glass is almost fogged up She makes her way to the-

CONTROL PANEL-

The red yellow and green graph is bright red Under it

TWO

BUTTONS with Chinese ideograms on them
AND
Her finger hesitates as she takes a wild guess

SHE PRESSES-

A FAINT HISSING SOUND is heard

THE CABIN PRESSURIZES

As oxygen fills the space-

SOUND BEGINS TO EMERGE

Unrecognizable at first is a rhythmic pattern under a

syncopated
murmur But as air allows sound to conduct its waves it

becomes

clear

AN ALARM IS GOING OFF

Over it a recording plays in a LOOP It is in Mandarin The

VOICE in the recording is urgent Clearly it is not good
news

LOOP

Shes in pain and more tired than ever now and shes

punchy

LOOP (CONTD)
she

struggles

the

the

parts

She waits floating
INSIDE THE HELMET-
The glass is completely fogged up Through the condensation

can only discern a RED LIGHT filtering through
She waits

RYAN
Come on Come on

And when the RED GLOW turns to ORANGE-
Ryan UNLOCKS her helmet and using only her left hand
to take it off

As the helmet floats bouncing off of the cabin walls Ryan
massages her injured shoulder She does this gently as even

smallest pressure inflicts pain

The orange light is turning green when-

She feels the Station quake fiercely reverberating through
handle shes holding onto

THE STATION RUMBLES

OUTER SPACE
The Tiangong is plummeting

The tip of a solar panel is already grazing over the outer
layers of the atmosphere leaving a trail behind it as it

the gases

DEBRIS passing under the Station burn up

TIANGONG NODE 1
EVERYTHING SHAKES
Ryan rushes out of the airlock

A new intensity sparkles in her eyes Her fearlessness and
long

LAB

two

far

where it

determination are bordering with madness

She inspects her surroundings Through a hatch she sees a
corridor-like cabin that leads to another node It is the
MODULE

The LOOP keeps on playing

LOOP

She enters the hatch into the-
TIANGONG LAB MODULE

The only light is coming from flickering emergency lights
Objects float in chaos

Ryan makes her way dodging the disarray of lab objects-—

Scientific instruments A plant drifting by with its roots
exposed clusters of liquid floating like wobbly spheres

eggs hovering one of which is broken
THE SHAKING INTENSIFIES as-

She reaches the end of the module and goes into the-

TIANGONG NODE 2
She floats to the center of the node
There are three open hatches- RIGHT LEFT and-
BELOW-
A Docking Module very similar to the one in the ISS At the
end of it an open hatch leads into the SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD

MORE RUMBLING SHAKES THE STATION

OUTER SPACE

A SOLAR PANEL defeated by the friction with the atmosphere
breaks off from the Station and is thrown farther down
through
then-
seat In

quickly burns dissolving into sparks

The TIDAL WAVE of debris is catching up with the Station a
cloud of metal pieces that sparkle with the sunlight

BRIGHT STREAKS can be seen as debris burns scratching

the atmosphere

TIANGONG NODE 2
Ryan springs into the-
DOCKING MODULE

Floating through it and reaching the open hatch at the other
end she tosses the helmet inside the Shenzhou

A LOUD METALLIC ROAR The Station is collapsing She dives
through the hatch into the-

SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD AIRLOCK

It is almost identical to the Soyuzs airlock

She does a quick flip and-

CLOSES the outer hatch

Then she pulls on another latch and-

CLOSES the inner hatch

The Shenzhou is SEALED OFF from the rest of the Station

She throws the helmet into the Control Cabin and follows
through into the-

SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD CONTROL CABIN

She struggles to turn around in the confined space and

She pulls the hatch CLOSED
THE CONTROL CABIN IS SEALED

The Shenzhou is smaller than the Soyuz and has only one

this confined space the SHAKING of the station is felt even
stronger
board

the

of

She sits BUCKLES herself in and looks at the-
CONTROL PANEL
It has more monitors than the Soyuzs panel and the main

is arranged differently All of the buttons are labeled with
CHINESE IDEOGRAMS

AND IT IS SHAKING FIERCELY

RYAN
Seriously

THROUGH-
THE PORTHOLE-

A thin bright yellow halo covers the whole window

OUTER SPACE
The yellow halo envelops the whole Station as it glides over

outer atmosphere
FRICTION

The remaining SOLAR PANEL resists breaking off from the
structure but still goes up in flames leaving a trail of
SPARKS
SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD
EVERYTHING IS SHAKING
RYAN
In the Soyuz the power button is
ermhere
She passes her finger over the board trying to make sense
the buttons
RYAN (CONTD)
Ah ok ah undocking

undockingeenie meenie

SHE PRESSES
An ALARM RINGS and under the ongoing LOOP a RECORDING
clearly
warning

RECORDING

RYAN
Ok That doesnt sound good

She glances around frantically turns it off

Its shaking very intensely but shes wide-eyed now clearly
close to being beside herself

RYAN (CONTD)
Miini moh

She tries a BIG BUTTON that says-
A NEW ALARM followed by a NEW RECORDING also a warning-
And with a horrible accent-

RYAN (CONTD)
No hablo chino

She keeps searching for the right button
RYAN (CONTD)
Mini moh

And she presses a new one

The LIGHTS on the Control Panel GO ON The cabin makes a
humming
sound as SYSTEMS BEGIN TO ACTIVATE

On the control panel lights go on in patterns reminiscent of
the
switchboard in the Soyuz

RYAN (CONTD)
Okayokay

She begins going through the progressions she used on the
Soyuz
only quicker this time jabbing button after button

RYAN (CONTD)
GoodgoodThere And this should
be
on

to

She presses one more button and systems turn to green

RYAN (CONTD)
Okay Houston in the blind

She raises her voice to be heard over the GROWING RUMBLE

RYAN (CONTD)
This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone
reporting from the Shenzhou Im about
to undock from the Tiangong and I have
a bad feeling about this mission

She presses a new button and the system goes to green And
the MONITOR a COUNTDOWN appears

RYAN (CONTD)
Reminds me of a story Houston--

She reacts to a bad shake of the cabin

RYAN (CONTD)
Okay you know what Houston Never
mind the story

She looks around as the cabin starts shaking even harder

RYAN (CONTD)
Its getting hotter in here

She watches the COUNTDOWN on the MONITOR- 359 358
RYAN (CONTD)

The way I figure it theres only two
POSSIBLE OUTCOMES--

Ryan keeps her eyes fixed on the countdown Raises her voice
compete with the rising chaos
RYAN (CONTD)
I either make it down in one piece and
Ill have one hell of a story to
tell
And now the noise and the shake are nearing their peak
RYAN (CONTD)
Or I burn up in the next ten

minutes

Ryan smiles flips the safety lid of a button open
RYAN (CONTD)
Whichever way it goes no harm no
foul
As the cabin RATTLES VIOLENTLY

RYAN (CONTD)
Because either way--

She closes her eyes puts her finger over the button

RYAN (CONTD)
Itll be one hell of a ride

Ryan presses the button

RYAN (CONTD)
Im ready

OUTER SPACE

The Station is bouncing over the atmosphere One end of it

is

glowing more brightly and catches FIRE

The TIDE OF DEBRIS is getting closer Not far off some
pieces

are already burning

A LARGE PIECE OF DEBRIS has caught on fire and is flying at

great speed and-

COLLIDES WITH THE STATION

Tearing it into two parts which are sent twisting in
opposite

directions The ESCAPE POD attached to the DOCK is
spinning

towards earth

SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD

Ryan is SHAKEN and RATTLED in her seat

RYAN

Yeehaaa

GRAVITY is still minimal but the force of the inertia is
rough

and it jerks her around She sees-
A RED LEVER above her but she can only reach it with her

bad
hand
SHE STRETCHES
RYAN (CONTD)
Ahhhhhhhh
SHE GRABS THE LEVER-
AND PULLS IT
OUTER SPACE
THE LOCKS DISENGAGE-
THE CABIN separates from the rest of the vessel and from the
Station It spins away plummeting toward the atmosphere
The two fragments of the Tiangong follow spinning in a rage
of
sparks and fire
SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD
The spinning is punishing Ryan is shaken violently She is
also
mumbling words to herself that we cant hear It looks like
she

rambling

Some LIGHTS GO OFF

ATMOSPHERE 130 KM ABOVE THE EARTH
The capsules aerodynamics slow down the spinning
positioning

the vessel nose up

It cuts through the atmosphere at incredible speeds
Its metal is burning hot

Smoldering DEBRIS and the fragments of the STATION chase the
Shenzhou in its descent

SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD
THE PORTHOLE-
A blinding light pours in from outside the window

The spinning is over but the cabin vibrates with a loud

rumble

As the G-Force restrains Ryan against her seat she clenches
her

face and sweats

On the ceiling condensation begins to form

ATMOSPHERE 120 KM ABOVE THE EARTH

The Shenzhou is a ball of fire precipitating from the skies

Its followed very closely by DEBRIS and the two fragments
of

the STATION

The TWO FRAGMENTS COLLIDE and EXPLODE into a ball of fire
that

breaks into many pieces

An avalanche of fire cascades towards the Shenzhou rapidly

closing the distance

SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD

In THE PORTHOLE-

Outside burning debris is passing by The gravitational pull

keeps Ryan tense in her seat as drops fall on her face She

LOOKS AT-

THE CEILING- where condensation is dripping

ATMOSPHERE 100 KM ABOVE THE EARTH

The avalanche is about to swallow the cabin when the burning

debris disintegrates before reaching the cooling
STRATOSPHERE

The capsule escapes the inferno as the debris crumbles ina
final explosion expelling-

A VERY SMALL PIECE OF DEBRIS that-
smoke

DOWN

red

cabins

more

SHOOTS towards the Shenzhou and-

SKIMS its surface tearing one of the outer shields

SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD

The impact is felt inside and a panel falls off A small
trail is formed around its wires

Ryan is restrained against her seat by the gravitational
of the fall and-

EVERYTHING IS SHAKING

LOWER ATMOSPHERE 70 KM ABOVE EARTH

The Shenzhou has left the burning debris behind

As it touches the lower atmosphere it immediately COOLS
dimming its brightness surrounded by a purple sky

It FREEFALLS 98 meters per second and-

A PARACHUTE RELEASES

The long fabric comes out and EXPANDS as the air fills the
and white canopy When its fully open it SLOWS DOWN the

descent and lets it glide in a diagonal path over the Earth

SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD
A BREATH OF RELIEF as through THE PORTHOLE-

She sees the ropes of the parachute extend out to the large
canvas cushioning the fall

LOWER ATMOSPHERE 10 KM ABOVE THE EARTH
A SECOND PARACHUTE expands

It slows the fall even further shifting the cabin into a
seems

getting

of

hitting

to

the

vertical descent toward the ground that is so close it now

tangible

SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD
Ryan starts COUGHING

The cabin is quickly filling with SMOKE and-
The white cloud of smoke overflowing the small space is

thicker

LOWER ATMOSPHERE 1 KM ABOVE THE EARTH
The Shenzhou drops hanging from the parachutes at a speed
thirty kilometers per hour

It is surrounded by a blue sky It passes through a layer of
clouds

SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD

She coughs as the white smoke is becoming unbearable Shes
suffocating

LOWER ATMOSPHERE 100 METERS ABOVE THE EARTH
The Shenzhou is rapidly approaching the ground
t is falling straight toward a lake Two meters before
ITS SURFACE-
THE LANDING ENGINES IGNITE giving the downward thrust meant

cushion the landing on a hard surface

fq

The thrust parts the water creating a curtain of steam and
Shenzhou gently falls down-
INTO THE LAKE-

Making a wave that spreads out in a circle
She is

launched

the

SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD

Ryan feels the cabin hit the water She has landed safely
But she cannot celebrate because she cant stop coughing
asphyxiating in the thick cloud of smoke

She UNSTRAPS herself and-

Reaches a LEVER at the side of the hatch

She PULLS THE LEVER
ON THE LAKE

With a small controlled explosion the hatch cover is
away from the cabin

Smoke pours out through the open hatch

SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD
She begins to unstrap herself when-
WATER POURS IN through the open hatch

She tries to make her way out fighting against the strong
current that is gushing in but the flow is too strong and-

IT PUSHES HER BACK IN

She struggles to force her way through the cascade rapidly
filling the cabin but it is too strong

THE CABIN IS OVERFLOWING
The water has reached Ryans chin when-
She manages to take ONE LAST DEEP BREATH of air before-

WATER COMPLETELY FILLS IT

UNDERWATER

The metallic capsule which weighs almost three tons sinks
quickly into the lake As the ropes of the parachute tense

long fabric follows the cabin down
and

arm

the

use

its

struggles

SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD

Air trapped inside Ryans suit leaks out through the collar
small bubbles float up

Ryan fights her way to the hatch and pulling with her good

she swims out

UNDERWATER
She pushes herself away from the cabin swimming away from
POD AS-

THE SHENZHOU HITS THE LAKE BOTTOM
A dark cloud of mud swells up around it

Ryan struggles to SWIM UP to the surface but she can only
one arm and the wet suit is DRAGGING HER DOWN

She strokes rapidly but she isnt moving up Instead-
SHES GOING DOWN and

HER FEET SINK INTO THE LAKE BED

She looks up and sees-

The rays of sunlight breaking through the lakes surface are
eclipsed by the parachute which floats down toward her like

huge jellyfish about to engulf its pray

THE FROG crosses in front of her effortlessly swimming on
way to the surface

Small bubbles of air come out of Ryans nose as she

to

open her suit

She takes off the BOTTOM PART of the suit

ABOVE HER-

THE PARACHUTE IS GETTING CLOSER a net about to trap her
out

out

come

She

She struggles out of the TOP PART of her suit And squirming
from under it-
She frees herself from the heavy garments and SWIMS UP as-

THE SINKING PARACHUTE traps her foot and begins dragging her
down But with a kick-

SHE SETS HERSELF FREE and-
SHE SWIMS UP stroking with her good arm She is completely
of breath only the tiniest bubbles rise from her nose

She is about to lose consciousness when she sees-

THE FROG swimming ahead of her sliding smoothly through the
water toward the rays of sunlight diffracted by the surface

Ryans eyes are closed as she floats up her body limp The
surface is coming closer and closer

She reaches the thin boundary between water and air and she

out to the-
SURFACE

And she takes an enormous breath

RYAN
AAAHHHHHH

Almost primal like the first breath of a newborn child it
burns her lungs but reclaims life

She only has enough strength to keep her face above water
FLOATS catching her breath and taking long gulps of air
She looks up at-

THE SKY-

Where the clouds move caressed by air and light And beyond
THEM-

OUTER SPACE but-
SHES BACK ON EARTH

She turns around and-
last

life

her

of

TAKING A DEEP BREATH-
She SWIMS breaking through the water and harnessing every
bit of energy in her

And soon she arrives to the-

SHALLOW EDGE OF THE LAKE

She drags herself from the water like the first amphibious
form crawling out of the primordial soup onto land
COLLAPSES ON THE SHORE

The water laps gently over her washing in and out around
legs

SHE LIES with her face against the muddy shore and her eyes
closed recovering her strength

AND SHE BREATHES
SHE BREATHES AIR
And as her breath steadies-

SHE SMILES
She pushes her face against the ground enjoying the sense

weight and-
SHE OPENS HER EYES

Then she looks at her surroundings taking in the almost
unbearable beauty of the planet Earth

Shes breathing deeply and begins to cough
Its not a cough its a chuckle

RYAN IS CRACKING UP

Ecstasy overcomes Ryan and-

Joyful laughter fills her body

SHE IS ALIVE
knees

and

unstable

RYAN
Thank you

She PLANTS HER PALMS against the ground and-

With an effort she pushes herself up

SHE FEELS HER WEIGHT and manages to rise to her hands and

like a four-legged mammal

And she STANDS UP

ONE FOOT FALLS heavily on the ground It sinks into the mud
THEN-

ANOTHER FOOT

Ryans FEET are solidly planted on the mud

RYAN (CONTD)
Abhhhh

One foot moves forward and lands on more solid ground
coping with the weight And then-

The other foot follows as-

SHE BEGINS TO WALK ON PLANET EARTH laughing

SHE IS PUNCH DRUNK

SHE IS FREE
