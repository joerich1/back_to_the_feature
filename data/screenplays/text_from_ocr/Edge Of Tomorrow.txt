INT UNITED DEFENSE FORCES DROPSHIP - IN FLIGHT - STORM

SOUND Someone breathing GASPING for breath theyre so
afraid And the HIGH-PITCHED WHINE of RAMJETS laboring
against heavy side-winds as we struggle to focus on -

- OPEN OCEAN CHURNING whipping past at a couple hundred
miles an hour 800 feet below a SOLDIERS DANGLING BOOTS

CAGE (VO)
What am I doing here

PVT BILLY CAGE is maybe 20 Too young for this COLD SWEAT
trickles into his eyes When he tries to wipe it away his
ARMORED FINGERS CLACK against clear ACRYLIC His FACEPLATE

Cage is wearing an EXOJACKET powered tight-fitting body
armor bristling with weaponry TWO DOZEN OTHER young
terrified SOLDIERS hang with him also jacketed dangling
over the OPEN BAY DOORS over OCEAN

Cage taps a button His faceplate opens NOISE floods in at a
DEAFENING ROAR He rubs his eyes -

YONABURU
Dont poke yer eye out bud

PVT YONABURU a hard-ass fuckup with Asian features but a
Southern drawl - Cages battle-buddy - smiles

SGT FARELL
GET YOUR PLATE SHUT PRIVATE

FROM UP FRONT BATTLE-SCARRED SGT FARELL shoots them a look

ACROSS from Cage GRIFF 25 a burly-looking bad-ass keeps
making an about-to-vomit face barely fighting back the urge

SGT FARELL (CONTD)
PRIVATE GRIFF Dont PUKE

GRIFF
Yes sir

Griffs face twitches again A female soldier NANCE grins
NANCE
You spit up in yer jacket youre
in for a world a shit

FORD a jarhead dickweed proper LAUGHS missing a few teeth

Now OIL from Cages jacketed fingers streaks his face The
faceplate sucks shut FLOATING HEADS-UP READOUTS flicker up -
YONABURU
You OK there buddy
CAGE
(trembling)
Yeah
YONABURU

Were gonna be fine I got us life
insurance Mrs Smith

Yonaburu taps MRS SMITH an antiquated SMITH and WESSON
-357 against his faceplate and slips it in his exojackets
utility belt Cage doesnt look too reassured

SGT FARELL
eREADY FOR DROP HOLDING

BENEATH THEIR FEET
DOZENS OF OTHER FB90 DROPSHIPS streak by squarish clumsy-
looking like flying bricks which is what everyone calls

them ARTILLERY FIRE STRAFES back and forth as -

A DROPSHIP takes a HIT and is gone FAR BELOW a BEACH comes
into view a red SQUARE superimposed on the HEADS-UP -

THE DROP POINT Cage shuts his eyes

CAGE
Oh God oh God oh God -

SGT FARELL
GO GO GO

The first SOLDIER hits a release and FALLS tumbling Then
ANOTHER Then ANOTHER YONABURU gives Cage the thumbs up and -

YONABURU
WOOOHOOOO

Yonaburu hits his RELEASE and -
FROM BENEATH THE DROPSHIP

- SOLDIERS LITTER OUT tumbling like living ordinance Youd
think parachutes might open but they dont

BACK IN THE DROP SHIP

SGT FARELL
DROP DROP YOU BABIES

CAGE CANT DO IT SEVERAL OTHERS cant either ONE SOLDIER
DANGLES by a jacketed hand like a kitten going to the vet
Sgt Farell KICKS the hand free and JUMPS himself -

RADIO
(screeching)
TAKING FIRE UP HERE WE GOTTA

KERWHAM The dropship is STRUCK - TWICE One of the hanging
soldiers is TORN IN HALF the pieces flying FLAME belches
through the DROPBAY and the ship LURCHES -

Cage SCREAMS HITS his release and -

TUMBLES OUT OF THE DROPSHIP

The dropship ABOVE in FLAMES BURNING SOLDIERS falling
OTHERS clinging on as it SPINS OUT OF CONTROL CAGE FALLS
SCREAMING his HEADS-UP flashing red the ground RUSHING UP -
EXT BEACHHEAD - BATTLE OF RUBY TUESDAY

- WHUMP THUMP FHUMP SOLDIERS hit the beach hard enough to
leave CRATERS in the WET SAND

AND HERE COMES CAGE SCREAMING FLAILING KICKING - at the
last second his jacket goes into AUTOLAND tiny JETS cushion
the fall just enough to not break any bones and WHAM

Two seconds of ear-ringing silence A GASP as Cages lungs
refill he staggers up WET SAND falling from his faceplate
his HEADS-UP highlighting TERRAIN and FRIENDLIES -

THREE OTHER SOLDIERS stagger up out of their own craters

HAPPY SOLDIER
WE MADE IT

THE HAPPY SOLDIER smiles at Cage and -

12 TONS OF FLAMING DROPSHIP LAND ON THE HAPPY SOLDIER Cage
is THROWN BACK from the impact landing in two feet of surf
Struggling back up he sees -

THE BROKEN DROPSHIP SPEWING FLAME ANOTHER SOLDIER stuck half-
under the ship FLAILING as he dies Cage stares in shock

YONABURU
CAGE YOU IN ONE PIECE

CAGE
I uh yeah - the ship the ship
YONABURU
COME ON

Cage turns seeing YONABURU with a FLOATING BLUE HEADS-UP
FLAG superimposed above him Cage blindly runs after him as -

UP THE BEACH

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER JACKETED INFANTRY stream to their
meetpoints thick as ants ARTILLERY STRAFING PAST THEM as -

IN THE SKY

MORE DROPSHIPS THAN WE CAN COUNT and fast-moving STRIKEJETS
beyond them STREAK in loose formations into the horizon and -

OUT TO SEA

MASSIVE CARRIERS lob HEAVY ORDINANCE into the already blasted
coastline pieces of SEA-CLIFF exploding HALF A MILLION
SOLDIERS are landing today in what can only be -

HUMANITYS LAST BEST STAND RUBY TUESDAY

It looks like D-Day meets Armageddon

SGT FARELL (ON RADIO)
ASSEMBLE AT THE TRENCH

CAGE AND YONABURU CLUMSILY RUN

to join their company Its hard to even walk in an exojacket
if youre not practiced in it and they arent

ON THEIR HEADS-UPS Their TWO BLUE DOTS get closer to the
cluster of OTHER BLUE DOTS as the first ENEMY FIRE starts
streaking in TEARING UP THE BEACH THAP THAP

CAGE JUMPS YONABURU TOO -

- BOTH land badly SCRAMBLE UP catching a first GLIMPSE of
THOUSANDS OF ENEMY INFANTRY streaming down the cliffs but -

CAGE AND YONABURU TUMBLE INTO THE TRENCH

Falling in with the other terrified SOLDIERS SGT FARELL
screaming to TAC-COM about wheres his fucking air support
Cage has two seconds to get his bearings before -

ON CAGES HEADS-UP

A RED DOT approaching the BLUE DOTS of his company Then a
few more RED DOTS
CAGE
This isnt how its supposed to be
This isnt First Division was
supposed to clean this up -

SGT FARELL
LOCK AND LOAD

Cage watches in mounting horror as the heads-up shows FOUR
MORE PAIR And then 20 And then a WALL OF RED

CAGE
Were all gonna die

YONABURU
Shut the fuck up

SGT FARELL
HOLD HOLDING

Even the Sergeant cant hide his fear

SGT FARELL (CONTD)
LIGHT EM UP

As the FIRST SOLDIER out of the trench jumps up a PROJECTILE
hits him knocking him at CAGES FEET -

The PROJECTILE in the soldiers chest isnt of human origin
Its streaked with silver biomechanical WRIGGLING A MIMIC
JAVELIN And from where the thing flew -

THE ON-RUSHING MIMIC HORDE

At first you could mistake them for human infantry but
theyre not They are ALIEN KILLING MACHINES

Theyre ARMORED SHARP and BRISTLING with unidentifiable
weaponry that seems to grow out of their bodies like a
nightmare version of the jacketed soldiers theyre evolved to
kill Parts are METAL parts GLISTENING BIOMASS

MIMICS have no individuality no emotion purpose or
existence other than the vicious removal of human life

SOLDIER
INCOMING

THE SOLDIERS FIRE into the RACING MASS They might as well be
firing BB-GUNS at an oncoming BUFFALO STAMPEDE

ANOTHER soldier down the line takes TWO JAVELIN HITS His
jacket starts SHAKING JITTERBUGGING off his brainstems
death-throes his autocannon FIRING wildly -

MIMIC JAVELINS sweep the trench where Cage and Yonaburu try
to aim - THUP THUP THUP

SGT FARELL (RADIO)
CHECKPOINT TWO MOVE MOVE MOVE

Soldiers start RUNNING But Cage is FROZEN TO THE SPOT
trembling unable to MOVE Yonaburu SLIDES DOWN BESIDE HIM -

YONABURU
COME ON CAGE WE GOTTA -

- BLAM A SECTION OF TRENCH COLLAPSES

The hail of sand and smoke clears just in time to see the

rest of 3rd Platoon HAULING ASS UP THE BEACH ON CAGES HEADS-
UP the LITTLE BLUE DOTS of their team head OFFSCREEN

CAGE AND YONABURU ARE TOTALLY CUT OFF

YONABURU (CONTD)
SHIT SHIT

Yonaburu slides into firing position - target numbering
systems on OVERLOAD -

YONABURU (CONTD)
Jesus here it comes

Cage lifts his weapon shaking trying to pick a target Its
useless In two seconds theyre gonna be DEAD MEAT

CAGE
Oh god oh god oh god -

A squelchy RADIO SCREECH -
CHIEF BREEDER (RADIO)
VALKYRIE ONE this is CHIEF
BREEDER STRIKEJETS GOT A LOCK

YOUNG WOMANS VOICE (RADIO)
THEN LAY EM DOWN CB

CHIEF BREEDER
YES MAAM

SLEEK UDF STRIKEJETS FOUR OF THEM streak in low MIMICS
volley JAVELIN as the sleek aircraft swing in for bombing -

ONE STRIKEJET takes a hit and tumbles FLAMING the PILOT
SCREAMING as he spins PLOWING INTO the MIMIC FRONT LINE

but then the OTHER STRIKEJETS deliver their payloads

KATHOOM A WALL OF FLAME goes up the ground SHAKING from the
impact SMOKING TWITCHING FRAGMENTS of MIMIC RAIN DOWN -

YOUNG WOMANS VOICE (RADIO)
CLEAR FOR CLOSE ENGAGEMENT

WHAM WHAM WHAM THREE BIG JACKETED SOLDIERS land SMOOTHLY
ROLLING into 3-point fighting position This is DOG COMPANY

DOG COMPANY SOLDIERS are different Their exojackets are
blackened dented tricked out with graffiti decals from the
countries theyve fought in Their grim faces are scarred
Not a one of them stands under 64

YOUNG WOMANS VOICE (RADIO) (CONTD)
Eat ‘em up boys

The Dogs MASSIVE SHOULDER ROCKETS OPEN FIRE 20mm 50mm
cannons nailing MIMICS right and left -

YONABURU
Holy shit

CAGES EYES GO WIDE and the WORLD GOES SLOW as -
SERGEANT-MAJOR RITA VRATASKI

AKA VALKYRIE ONE AKA THE FULL METAL BITCH LEAPS flying
RIGHT OVER CAGE AND YONABURUS HEADS -

Her sleek exojacket is painted BLOOD RED Its bare of
weaponry except for - her TUNGSTEN CARBIDE BATTLE AXE Almost
comically HUGE nearly as big and certainly as heavy as she
is Good for one thing BISECTING MIMICS

The axe SWINGS and four MIMICS are converted to eight
TWITCHING HEAPS She rolls into a PERFECT BATTLE STANCE

Her face beautiful battle-ready and deadly calm -

RITA
Take me to your leader

- and with a collective YELL the rest of DOG COMPANY follow
her STRAIGHT INTO THE MIMIC FRONT LINE Yonaburu JUMPS UP -

YONABURU
Its RITA THE FULL METAL BITCH
Come on man we gotta -

But Cage is running across the sand DESERTING

YONABURU (CONTD)
CAGE

Worse yet TWO MIMIC RUNNERS have detached and GIVE CHASE
YONABURU FIRES taking one down but the other is closing in -

He looks back to where RITA and the DOGS mercilessly engage
the mimic in a ballet of precision fighting Hed join but -

YONABURU (CONTD)
Fuck

Yonaburu takes off after Cage as -

- Cage BLINDLY HAULS ASS for the SEA CLIFFS scrambling up a
rocky bluff Yonaburu catches up -

YONABURU (CONTD)
We have to get back to the unit

- and GRABS Cages leg Cage KICKS FLAILING -

CAGE
We wont make it Theyre all DEAD

YONABURU
They shoot deserters

CAGE
I dont care LET ME GO

Cage CRAWLS DRAGGING YONABURU to the CREST OF THE CLIFF

YONABURU
CAGE IM NOT LETTING YOU -

Yonaburu stands HEAVING BACK on CAGES LEG and -

SHUP HALF OF YONABURUS head disappears in a shattering of
red the broken shell of his faceplate smoking

CAGE
YONABURU

Yonaburus jacket twitches shudders goes limp - and falls

CAGE (CONTD)
No

Cage tries to stand but Yonaburus hand is still gripping
his ankle He twists scrambling up -

CAGE SEES WHAT SHOT YONABURU

The cliffs crest is a NEST OF MIMIC SCOUTS SEVEN of them
Only a little less surprised than Cage

Before he knows what hes doing hes got TARGET-LOCK Cage
FIRES BLINDLY the shock of his forearm cannon SPINNING him
around in an arc -

TAKTAKTAKTAKTAK SEVERAL MIMICS GO DOWN Cage FALLS on his
ASS just missing the swings of BLADED MIMIC ARMS -

- and hes STILL FIRING into MIMIC LEGS WHIPPING them down
to the ground No one has ever fought worse - or been as
lucky - as Cage at this moment In 23 seconds SIX DEAD
MIMIC lie twitching around him Cage SCOOTS back seeing -

- THE LAST MIMIC on the rise getting ready to FIRE
He SHOOTS it But with a CHITTERING BUZZING NOISE a FRESHLY

BIRTHED JAVELIN erupts from its dying body like a 400 mph
tumor and HITS Cages side CAGE FIRES AGAIN just as -

- a SECOND javelin hits his FACEPLATE it SHATTERS the WORLD
SPINS ARCS and Cage goes down BLACKING OUT -

EXT BATTLEFIELD - HOURS LATER

The LATE-AFTERNOON SUN streaks through TORN CLOUDS SMOKE
rises from the SCORCHED EARTH and BODIES of men aliens and
machines litter the terrain for miles A landscape of hell

Cage COUGHS OPENS HIS EYES

Hes lying on his back RAIN drizzling on his unprotected
face his BLOOD mixing in the puddles beside him YONABURUS
BODY and the DEAD MIMIC SCOUTS are scattered around

A LIVING MIMIC is nearby scavenging through the dead eating
bits of other fallen mimic It hasnt noticed Cage until -

CLICKING and WHIRRING YONABURUS EXOJACKET goes into power-
down releasing him like an insects carapace His dead
naked-except-for-underwear BODY slops into the mud and blood

The eater of the dead LOOKS UP Interested ANOTHER MIMIC
stands behind it Oh fuck Here they come

CAGE STRUGGLES to lift his 20mm CLICK CLICK Nothing The
MIMICS RUN THIS WAY CLICK CLICK Cage SCREAMS -

- SHUP The mimics body is TORN IN HALF - A FLASH of RED
EXOJACKET as THE SECOND IS CUT DOWN We barely see it happen
Just pieces of mimic falling and in two seconds its over

Cage blinks up at RITA VRATASKI

Her crimson exojacket shines in the afternoon sun Her gore-
spattered faceplate hovers over Cage then RETRACTS as she
grabs a canteen from her utility belt

Rita may be the greatest warrior on the planet but she cant
be more than 23 years old And shes beautiful

Storm clouds part BLUE SKY beyond but rain still drizzles
She drinks looking up at the sky

RITA
When I grew up in Pennsylvania
they had a name for this

CAGE
For what

RITA
For when its raining but the sun
is shining

Rita lifts Cages head giving him some water

RITA (CONTD)
They said it was because the devil
was beating his wife
(beat)
Who comes up with this crap

Cage trembles COUGHS blood sputters out

CAGE
Am I gonna make it

RITA
No I dont think so But Ill stay
with you until you die

CAGE
You dont have to thank you I -

RITA
I need your battery Its fresh
Looks like you hardly used it

This sinks in

CAGE
(bitterly)

Take it
RITA

You sure about that

CAGE
I dont deserve it

Rita gently pushes Cage over unhooking something on his
back Cage grimaces in pain He shivers bloody crying

CAGE (CONTD)
I I dont want to die

Rita looks at him a trace of painful softness in her face
RITA
Dyings not that bad once you get

used to it

Distant EXPLOSIONS moving closer Rita grabs her axe her
jacket whining up to full power her radio CRACKLES to life

RITA (CONTD)
I have to go Good luck soldier

CAGE
Fuck off

Rita smiles then heads off to the CLIFFS EDGE surveying
the Armageddon in progress far below

Cages jacket goes into power-down unhooking from his body
With the last of his strength he CRAWLS to Yonaburus side

CAGE (CONTD)
(delirious)
Yonaburu Im sorry I
Yonaburus one intact eye stares at him blind and dead
SPLISH SPLASH Cage FREEZES
A MIMIC FOOT quietly steps into the mud by Cages head Its
standing right over him This one is ODD its armor plates
and vesicles diffracting light in a OILY RAINBOW OF COLOR
It LEANS IN CLOSE SCANNING HIM Cage TREMBLES helpless
The things face is a HORRIBLE MAW - up close its no more a
functional face than a black widow spiders hourglass is a

functional timepiece A decorative WARNING to human prey

Detecting no threat from Cage the mimic shifts focus to -

- RITAS BACK Shes 20 yards away too distracted by the
battle to notice as -

The mimic begins to VIBRATE TINY BLACK TENDRILS exude from
every crevice of its armor waving in the breeze A FRESH
JAVELIN forming in the center of its body WHIRRING

And thats when Cage sees MRS SMITH Yonaburus antique
SMITH and WESSON GLINTING IN THE MUD -

Cage GRABS the pistol aims right up into the belly of the
mimic SHUTS his eyes and SQUEEZES THE TRIGGER - BLAM

Now a mimic could usually take a 357 slug and shrug it off
but Cage got it RIGHT BETWEEN THE PLATES With a hellish
SQUEAL the mimic STAGGERS the developing JAVELIN MISFIRES
TEARING a hunk of the mimics body with it -

- Cage fires AGAIN And AGAIN INNARDS SPILL -

SILVER-BLACK TENDRILS like melted plastic CRACKLING with
electrical charge DRIZZLE ONTO CAGES BODY at 600 degrees
CAGE SCREAMS as it BURNS INTO HIM There are probably worse
deaths but this one ranks way up there Its HORRIBLE -

- Cages DEATH-SCREAM scales register the sound going flat
and weird squelching out like a bad RADIO SIGNAL as -

- the IMAGE SHUDDERS FALLING APART winking out like an old
tube TV a high pitched WHINE a BUZZ and -
INT C-COMPANY BARRACKS - MONDAY MORNING

- CAGE SITS UP SCREAMING slapping at his chest like hes
trying to put out a fire

CAGE
AIGH HELP GET IT OFF ME

He ROLLS off his bunk FALLING to the floor TEARING at his
undershirt revealing - HIS SKIN perfectly intact beneath

YONABURU
What the fuck is wrong with you

YONABURU sits in his undershirt cleaning MRS SMITH staring
at Cage like hes crazy

CAGE
I was it was you were

Cage stares around like a trapped animal

SOLDIERS the men and women we saw on the dropship scattered
around the barracks in various states of undress stare back

CAGE (CONTD)
I uh I must have uh fallen
asleep Had a nightmare

GUY CAT-CALL
Didja piss yerself

GIRL CAT-CALL
Check his diaper

Theres a RECRUITMENT POSTER on Cages wall RITA VRATASKI
her crimson exojacket shining against blue sky hair flying
a stern look on her face I WANT YOU JOIN THE CLEANUP

But someone - Cage in fact - has defaced the poster to read
JOIN THE FUCK-UP SUCKERS Little skulls around her feet

NANCE a tough-looking GIRL SOLDIER burly as hell leers in

NANCE
Maybe it was a wet dream Maybe he
was dreamin about Rita

CAGE
Shut up Nance

She blows him a kiss Cage rubs his head in mild shock

CAGE (CONTD)
Ow GOD my head is killing me I
cannot drink like that anymore

YONABURU
Like what

CAGE
Like last night

YONABURU

We were here last night dumbass
Liquor raids tonight Battles

Cage blinks confused
CAGE
Oh I Right I gotta I think I
gotta go puke

INT LATRINES - DAY

Cage washes his face taking two aspirin hands shaking He
looks in the mirror trying to get a grip on himself -

CAGE
It was just a dream

INT C-COMPANY BARRACKS - DAY

Cage walks back to his bunk in a daze staring at the faces
of the SOLDIERS he just watched get killed some playing
video games some looking at porn some working out some
asleep half-dangling out of Mylar hammocks

- theres DAVIS who didnt make it out of the DROPSHIP -
- theres ROKER who took a JAVELIN in the chest -

- and YONABURU hunkering over a map that looks like football
strategy PALKA a short Norwegian tosses him WIRE CLIPPERS

YONABURU
Mission accomplished

PALKA
We have our exfiltration point

Palka circles a spot on the map

YONABURU
Excellent Well strike at 2200
Griff youre gonna be the decoy -

GRIFF
You think they got tequila

YONABURU
‘Course they do Theyre officers
They got everything

PALKA
Going to get DRUUNK

Yonaburu rolls up the map hiding it Cage frowns worried

CAGE
Man you ever feel like youre
remembering something while its
happening like its already -
(distracted)
Hey Ford Can you not do that

SEVERAL SOLDIERS are GAMBLING between the bunks heaps of
goodies behind the WINNER the LOSER throwing down his cards

The dealer FORD scoops chips smiling He was missing teeth
in the dropship now hes not

FORD
Do what

CAGE
Sarge busted our asses ALL DAY
yesterday in PT You wanna put
everyone through that again

FORD
Whatre you talking about Sarges
out all week gettin his arm sewed
back on Besides we got a lookout -

- indicating a FAT SOLDIER KIMMEL up near the door whose
attention is evenly divided between a HANDHELD VIDEO GAME and
HIS NOSE which he is picking mightily

CAGE
Dude he came RIGHT through that
door and -

SLAP SOMEONE SLAPS KIMMEL on the back of his head sending
his game skittering across the floor Cages eyes go WIDE

YONABURU
Oh Fuck

SGT FARELL
Now just what in the got-damned
fucking shit do we have here

SGT FARELL is a living piece of leather badly scarred mean
as piss Everyone is terrified of him even his superiors

Soldiers SCRAMBLE to attention but its FAR TOO LATE -

SGT FARELL (CONTD)
Im gone for SIX WHOLE DAYS and my
platoon the platoon with MY good
name on it has TRANSMOGRIFIED into
a veritable SHITSTORM of SHENANIGAN
and INIQUITY I AM APPALLED

Farell punctuates everything he says with VIOLENCE a well-
aimed KICK a SLAP a tipped-over FOOTLOCKER as the soldiers
FALL OVER EACH OTHER to come to ATTENTION -

SGT FARELL (CONTD)
You are ALL IN DEEPEST SHIT
PIG SHIT YOU MOTHERLESS BABIES

SLAP KICK No one escapes his reach

SGT FARELL (CONTD)
And you will NOT GET OUT of this
pigshit until you have EACH AND
EVERY ONE learned the life-giving
power of FEAR and DISCIPLINE the
NECESSITY of ORDER and ETHIC if I
have to personally KILL every
SINGLE ONE of you embarrassing
sacks of human waste and drag your
DEAD and LIFELESS BODIES by the
SHORTEST CURLIEST HAIRS and throw
you to the MIMIC HESSIANS

Two SOLDIERS exchange a look did he just say Hessians

SGT FARELL (CONTD)
DID you not think I would return
DID you not imagine that I would be
wholly prepared to CASTRATE and
MASTECTOMIZE each and every -

Sgt Farell stops short seeing the GAMBLERS who stand at
attention but their cards chips are scattered everywhere

His face curls into a whole new level of acid rage

SGT FARELL (CONTD)
(quietly)
Oh I see Ive interrupted a game

A few GAMBLERS close their eyes ready for certain death

SGT FARELL (CONTD)
Tell me Private Ford Why do I
hate gambling so much

FORD
(trembling as he recites)
Sir because its a game of chance

sir because it entertains the
notion that our fate is in
hands other than our own sir

SGT FARELL
And what do I think about chance

FORD
(reciting)
There is no chance There is only
choice And choice is character
And character is fate

SGT FARELL
Thats RIGHT

He SLAPS Ford anyway for good measure Silence Farell scans
the terrified soldiers in hateful wonder

His voice drops to an almost tender register as if he pities
these poor pukes for the choices they have made this morning

SGT FARELL (CONTD)
Now I know that none of you exactly
CHOSE to be here I know that all
the young ladies and gentlemen FIT
for the International Marine Forces
have long since been decimated by
the MIMIC DISEASE and that no
sooner have you conscripts
completed the most RUDIMENTARY
training than you are to be thrown
into what is GUARANTEED to be the
Mother of all Battles RUBY
TUESDAY
(softly)
We lost North America We lost the
Pacific We lose this we wont get
to fight another I would imagine
the pressure must be enormous

He scans their faces

SGT FARELL (CONTD)
Ask me if I care ASK ME IF I CARE
SOLDIER

SOLDIER
Sir do you -

SGT FARELL
NO I DO NOT CARE PT NOW NOW NOW

The soldiers HUSTLE OUT Cage stares STUNNED as we CUT TO

EXT UNITED DEFENSE FORCES BASE - DAY

A GLASSY TOWER looms above a SPRAWLING MILITARY BASE on a
BAY The base is the size of a city but its only part of
what will be the largest military operation in human history

YONABURU (0S)

FAR BELOW the soldiers of C-Company run in loose formation

EXT PHYSICAL TRAINING FIELD - OBSTACLE COURSE - DAY

Cage looks around the field sweating dazed
CAGE

say He always says that shit

C-COMPANY soldiers RUN past JEERING COMPANIES of better
behaved soldiers who arent getting PTed to death

CAGE

YONABURU
Fine You had a dream we were in

Valkyrie saved you - and then you

CAGE

YONABURU

CAGE

YONABURU
OK then Mr Wizard Tell me what

Cage looks around the field straining to remember

CAGE
Uhh Kimmels gonna pass out

The fat Private STRUGGLES over an easy OBSTACLE FARELL
SCREAMING at him until Kimmel FAINTS MEDICS rush over

YONABURU

Well I coulda seen that coming
CAGE

Yeah Well now Nance and Ford

over there theyre about to get in
this big-ass fight

NANCE and FORD power over a wall Nance taking the
opportunity to GRAB Fords ass He KICKS her they FALL IN
THE MUD Its ON

SGT FARELL starts yelling SOLDIERS start running over
egging them on -

CAGE (CONTD)
--and then Roker over there makes
a perfect shot

ROKER hits three BULLS-EYES HOOTS Yonaburu frowns spooked

CAGE (CONTD)
and then Davis gets his leg
stuck in the ropes

DAVIS swings over a rope obstacle slips and ends up swinging
upside down his leg tangled

CAGE (CONTD)
»-and then Ford has to go to the
infirmary after Nance busts his -

YONABURU
(scared)
Shut UP man yer freakin me out

CAGE
Thats what Im saying Ford gets
his teeth knocked out and then

Cage trails off seeing that RITA has walked onto the field
trailed by her Dogs

CAGE (CONTD)
What the hell

YONABURU
Holy fuck Its Valkyrie One

Out of her jacket Rita looks nothing like the amazon warrior
you might expect Shes small Delicate-looking

Out of their jackets the DOGS are if anything more
menacing than on the field muscled tatted scarred They
swagger in loose formation around Rita true to their name

GRIFF

(walking up)
Damn Looks like someone let the
Full Metal Bitch outta her tower

Cage stares bewildered Soldiers gathered around the fight
COME TO ATTENTION as RITA steps through -

- and INTO THE FIGHT where FORD swings at NANCE missing
leaving himself wide open Nance SWINGS her FIST coming in
SLOW MOTION Fords eyes WIDE his nose DOOMED -

- but RITA INTERCEPTS THE SHOT catching Nances fist with an
audible SMACK Ford staggers back Everything STOPS

RITA
How about you two save this for the
battle

FORD muddily salutes So does NANCE So does SGT FARELL

RITA (CONTD)
Why are these soldiers in PT the
day before battle Sergeant

SGT FARELL
3rd Platoon has a discipline
problem maam I felt that a
little physical exertion might help
them grasp this important military
concept

RITA
I see

With a nod from Rita one of the Dogs HITS THE DIRT assuming
a board-like position the ISO-PUSHUP

RITA (CONTD)
Lt Shep is demonstrating the iso-
pushup In Dog Company we use it
to practice discipline The iso-
pushup is the best training outside
of a jacket you will get

NOW

The whole PLATOON is in a PERFECT LINE in a position that
could pass for torture the ISO-PUSHUP Not going up not
going down - just holding position
RITA (CONTD)
To control your exojackets you must
control your body To control your
body you must control your mind

SWEAT drips from soldiers noses Its hardest for the
biggest ones Yonaburu TREMBLES - and COLLAPSES

SGT FARELL
GET BACK INTO POSITION PRIVATE

Yonaburu struggles to get back up Cage cant take his
off Rita Rita suddenly LOOKS THIS WAY Shit Here she

Cage looks down sweat dripping OTHER SOLDIERS DROP one by
one Rita holds the position effortlessly Cage is shaking

He finally DROPS

Yonaburu SLAPS Cage on the back -

INT BATTLE READINESS DEBRIEFING THEATER - DARKNESS

UP FRONT nervous-looking EXECUTIVE OFFICERS pencil-pushers
point to vidscreens where MIMICS and BATTLE PLANS hover -

FLAGS showing armies of EVERY NATIONALITY cruise in towards
the YUCATAN PENINSULA while the island of CUBA - all of the
Caribbean in fact - is SWARMED with GLOWING RED LINES that
extend halfway around the globe MIMIC FORCES

EXECUTIVE OFFICER
The mimic are amassing on the
island of Cuba preparing for an
all-out strike on the continent
When they reach a critical mass
they will attack

ON THE VIDSCREENS whole CONTINENTS have been wiped clean of
human influence NORTH AMERICA is gone ANTARCTICA is gone
Areas of CANADA appear to be DISEASED

EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CONTD)
Thats why were striking them
first If we wait we could lose
South America So this is what youd
call a uh critical juncture

Theyre working on their own plans tonights liquor raid

YONABURU

CAGE

YONABURU
Man whats wrong with you Youve
been acting like a dick all DAY
GRIFF
Told you hed puss out
INT LOCKER ROOMARMORY - NIGHT

Cage wanders the gloomy empty locker room

At his locker he stares in at his empty exojacket CAGE
emblazoned on front like a coffin with his own name on it

SGT FARELL appears

SGT FARELL
You asked some pretty good
questions today Private Made the
pencil pushers think That took
guts Sign of a good soldier

CAGE
Im not really a good soldier sir

Farell sits eyeing Cage in a new light

SGT FARELL
Youre really worried about
tomorrow aint you

CAGE
Sarge what if you were going into
battle and you knew you were going to
die What if you were like certain
with one hundred percent certainty

Farell thinks on this taking the question seriously

SGT FARELL

Then I wouldnt be afraid

(beat)
Thats what it takes to be a great
soldier Realize your doom and get
on with it Inflict the greatest
damage you can on your enemy And
die a hero

Farell rubs his jaw looking up at Cages exojacket

SGT FARELL (CONTD)
Come to think of it Private that
is the perfect condition in which
to enter any battlefield situation

Cage stares at his empty jacket thinking
SGT FARELL (CONTD)

You meet me in the sparring bay if

you want a little practice with

that thing
Farell exits Cage looks at the 5 written on his hand
CAGE PUTS ON HIS JACKET The LEGS bind the ARMS seal the
CHEST closes every slick moving polycarbonate plate whirring

into place as SYSTEM CHECKS fill the faceplate

Cage picks up his AUTOCANNON and we CUT TO

INT SPARRING BAY - NIGHT

Cage steps in looking around The bay is a vast echoing
space the size of an airplane hangar

CAGE
Sarge

Farell strikes without warning WHAM Cage goes down ina
tumble Farell knocking him sprawling

SGT FARELL
Forget about the jacket

WHAM Cage struggles to stand Hes really bad at this

SGT FARELL (CONTD)
Forget about me

At every turn Farell is delivering blows to poor Cage his
jacket STRAINS firing STREAKERS AUGMENTED-REALITY -
MUNITIONS that can only be seen from inside the faceplate

SGT FARELL (CONTD)
Use your instincts and the jacket
will help you Dont think about it
too much Dont fight the jacket

EVERYWHERE that Cage fires is milliseconds too late And the
Sergeant isnt even firing back Hes playing with him his
moves Aikido-like always using a foe against himself

SGT FARELL (CONTD)
When you forget that youre wearing
the jacket is when the soldier and
the jacket are one When the
soldier and the jacket are one the
mimic cannot defeat you

Cage gives it all hes got FINALLY landing a blow - WHACK

SGT FARELL (CONTD)
Good

And then Farell HAMMERS CAGE KNOCKING HIM CLEAN OFF HIS
FEET jumping landing on him pinning his arms back and
putting the barrel of his 50mm in Cages face

SGT FARELL (CONTD)
Youre green but youve got more
mettle than you think you do

Farell rolls off of him smiling

SGT FARELL (CONTD)
Now You wanna try that again

CAGE
Yes sir

WHAM

INT DROPSHIP - DAY

The dropship bay doors OPEN the OCEAN far below Cages
jacketed hand is shaking GRIFF making about-to-puke-face

SGT FARELL
GRIFF DONT PUKE

GRIFF

UP FRONT Farell gives them all a grim look When his eyes
meet Cage he gives him the tiniest nod of reassurance

BENEATH the BEACH comes into view and the DROP POINT
SGT FARELL

TERRIFIED SOLDIER - maybe KIMMEL - who clings for his life -

THE DROPSHIP TAKES THE HIT AND THEYRE OUT TUMBLING and -

EXT BEACHHEAD - DAY

CAGE LANDS on the beach WHAM Several other soldiers stagger
up out of their craters A happy soldier waves -

Cage TACKLES the SOLDIER barely knocking him out of harms
way as the DROPSHIP SMASHES DOWN - at least he saved one

YONABURU

The STUNNED SOLDIER stares back at the ship in shock -

HAPPY SOLDIER
The ship the ship

CAGE

THEY ROLL INTO THE TRENCH
Yonaburus heads-up is RED with mimic -

YONABURU

uselessly SCREAMS ORDERS to his RADIO -

SGT FARELL

CAGE
MIMIC ARE GONNA OVERRUN THIS TRENCH

SGT FARELL

A split-second BEAT Sgt Farell believes him

SGT FARELL

THE SOLDIERS MAKE IT OUT just as the trench is REDUCED TO
RUIN by JAVELIN FIRE -

CAGE
(to Yonaburu)
STAY WITH ME

The soldiers RUN for the CANYON as -

SEVERAL MIMIC RUNNERS detach and GIVE CHASE Cage TURNS
LEVELS his 20mm BLAM A MIMIC GOES DOWN FOLLOWING HIS LEAD -

- TWO OTHER SOLDIERS turn to FIRE on the MIMIC but are
OVERTAKEN Hand to hand the MIMIC are unstoppable the TWO
SOLDIERS are CUT DOWN as -

WHAM A MIMIC RUNS RIGHT INTO CAGE KNOCKING HIM SIDEWAYS
JAVELIN BLOOMING ACROSS ITS BODY ARMS SHARP AS RAZORS CAGE
ROLLS TWISTS and as it LEAPS -

He RAMS his PILEDRIVER in the mimics CRAW - KERWHAM The
mimic DIES javelin fizzling like dud fireworks

SGT FARELL (ON RADIO)

Yonaburu FIRES his 50mm KICKING back like a 10 year old
firing his first shotgun BLAM BLAM Not too accurate but
MIGHTY EFFECTIVE -

CAGE

CAGE staggers up but YONABURU TOOK A PIECE OF SHRAPNEL

YONABURU

CAGE

Still smiling Cage writes a 6 on his hand with a sharpie

CAGE (VO) (CONTD)
The Sarge was right If there

KIMMELS FACE intent on his video game Two blocky old-
skool STREET FIGHTERS square off One EATS the others LIVER

A weak improvised cheer goes up Farell frowns

SGT FARELL

He scans the place inspecting still suspicious

Sergeant-Major Vrataski
Yonaburus eyes go wide Heeler PUSHES Cage
Cage PUSHES back The mess hall goes still

CAGE

Cage SWINGS his tray Hes pretty fast Maybe if he were in

he weighs half as much as any one of them

THEYRE ALL OVER HIM Cage gets in one last good punch and
then Heeler swings the fist CONNECTS and we CUT TO

INT HOLOVID BAY - NIGHT

A SLOW-MOTION EXPLOSION RITA steps through the smoke
looking insanely awesome in an EARLIER EDITION of her
crimson exojacket The image FAST-FORWARDS

CAGE stands in the holobay intently studying Ritas moves
He switches out holodisks and -

ANOTHER IMAGE of Rita at the end of a battle exhausted

A CAMERAMAN pushes a camera in her face as shes drinking
she HURLS the bottle at the CAMERA the image WINKING OUT
Cage shuttles back to the frame before she hurls the bottle

Cage freezes that frame

Rita is beautiful And in that one frame she looks like the
loneliest person in the whole world

Cage walks around the LIFESIZE HOLOGRAM looking at her
closely He studies her melancholy face Shes frozen
standing in front of him like a translucent ghost

Their faces almost touching

But shes just a holovid image

Cage gestures the image moves out of STILL into MOTION -

- Ritas holovid bottle FLIES at Cages face and we

SMASH CUT TO

INT SPARRING BAY - NIGHT

FARELL LANDS a punch Cage barely feels it twisting and
fending Farell off with one hand Farell finally KICKS him
sending him flying Cage lies on his back frowning

SGT FARELL
You had enough

CAGE
How do you think she got so good

Farell stands over Cage bent over out of breath

SGT FARELL
Who

CAGE
Valkyrie One The Full Metal Rita

Farell sits on a bench easing off his faceplate He pulls
two apples out of his jacket Hands Cage one eats

SGT FARELL
Youve seen her fight

CAGE
Yeah I uh watch old warvids
(beat)
No one can move as fast as her I
dont know how she does it

Farell eats his apple thinking

SGT FARELL
Probly turns off her autobalancer

CAGE
Whats that

SGT FARELL
Have you signed your infirmary
release Organ donation forms Next
of kin notices

CAGE
Uh yeah

NOW Farell tweaks with the back of Cages jacket READOUTS on
the faceplate FLICKER as Farell hacks into the system -

SGT FARELL
On the island of Okinawa when the
farmers were under the tyranny of
the Samurai they founded Karate on
one simple principal that the
force of a blow was not in the
muscle behind it but in the mind
that could let go of the body

(beat)
Every muscle in the human body has
a kind of control on it - something
that tells it not to push too far
too fast Keeps your body from
tearing itself apart

(beat)
When the Okinawans learned to let
go of this control they found that
a human fist could puncture Samurai
armor And not suffer a scratch

He pulls out a chip shuts a port The suit momentarily
WILTS Then powers back up

SGT FARELL (CONTD)
Jackets have the same kind of
control on em Without it if
youre not careful you could tear
yourself to shreds just by tryin
to run too fast

The faceplate readout flashes WARNING AUTOBALANCER DISABLED

SGT FARELL (CONTD)
Take a step Easy Easy

Cage STEPS BOUNCING clumsy Spring-loaded

CAGE
This is pretty cool

SGT FARELL
Now take a swing at that target
but I want you to -
WHAM Cage STRIKES the METAL PYLON-SHAPED TARGET -

- and sends himself FLYING across the room in the process
landing in a HEAP OW Farell grins

SGT FARELL (CONTD)
I didnt turn off the pain
feedback Just to keep things fair

When Cage gets up he looks the target is GONE -

- because its CRUMPLED AROUND HIS FIST A twisted fragment
falls to the floor

CAGE
Wow

SGT FARELL
You wouldnt want to use this on
the field of battle Its against
regulation Someone could get hurt

Farell WINKS and we CUT TO

EXT MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN - RUBY TUESDAY

YONABURU
(frowning)
315

Cage DISPATCHES a straggler MIMIC Leading the men up out of
the CANYON As they near the crest of the hill -

- its started SNOWING

CAGE
For instance did you know that the
weather is totally unpredictable
They say a butterfly flapping its
wings in Australia can make enough
of a difference that on the other
side of the world a month later
there might be a hurricane all
because of whether or not that
butterfly was having a bad day

YONABURU
What does that have to do with
anything

Cage looks up at the sky watching flakes of snow fall

CAGE
I dont know The weathers always
different

YONABURU
Of course its always different
Thats like the whole idea of
weather

They get to a CLIFF Visibility is low

Cage motions to several GROUPS of soldiers who all creep
into position Hes organizing an AMBUSH

Cage SCANS the field below his heads-up BINOCULAR-STYLE -
CAGE
Now the mimic will be gathering

the mimic ambush back down the hill but -

TAK TAK SPT SPT SPT -

Cage JUMPS onto the turret of a HALF-EXPLODED TANK KICKING
mimic away TEARING off the main cannon and using it as a

BLUDGEON WHANG WHANG WHANG

He CLEANS UP on the six MIMICS the last one running in a
circle like a dying cockroach He hits it again Its DEAD

Cage looks at the twisted piece of metal in his hand
An IDEA

The smoke and blowing snow clears and a GIGANTIC MIMIC
stomps into view towering least 30 FEET TALL

CAGE (CONTD)

It SWINGS a huge arm DOWN all goes BLACK and we

EXT UDF FORCES BASE - DRIZZLING RAIN - VARIOUS

Cage walks keeping his head down in the light drizzle
RITAS GLASS TOWER looms over the base like a shining needle
What happens next is a SYMPHONY OF MOVEMENT AND SYNCHRONY

CAGE (VO)

Sarge always said there was no such
thing as chance as luck I still
didnt believe him Lots of things
didnt seem to follow any pattern
The weather for instance But other
things - it was weird just how
predictable some things could be

Cage walks across the base like the proverbial Rabbi walking
between the raindrops He knows EVERY MOVEMENT of each person
on this base swarming with busy people rushing to and fro

We flip in and out of SLOW MOTION as -

- a GUARD turns and looks at a piece of paper blowing across
the road -

- CAGE STEPS IN FRONT OF HIM just out of line of vision
neatly CROSSING THROUGH A CHECKPOINT and -

- STEPPING ONTO THE BACK OF A MOVING TRUCK like youd catch a
carousel horse It cruises slows the driver SHOUTING at
SOMEONE for just long enough for Cage to STEP OFF the truck -

- and right behind a GUARD who he shadows RIGHT behind him
and then splits off down an alley -
- past a GUY and GIRL soldier illegally NECKING -

- and now skirting the base of Ritas TOWER where several of
DOG COMPANY hang out at the base telling jokes -

CAGE (VO) (CONTD)
Id tried to get through them twenty
times before I realized I didnt
have to get through them at all

RITAs CRIMSON EXOJACKET stands in the middle of a large
WORKROOM looking mighty except for the LEG which is OPEN
pieces strewn out on the floor

SHASTA RILEY Ritas pigtailed overalled Coke-bottle-
glasses-wearing CHIEF ENGINEER pores over the machinery

Shasta is so frustrated over whatever shes looking at that
she doesnt realize Cage is STANDING RIGHT OVER HER

Cage winces this part is always hard to get right -

CAGE
Uh hi there -

Shasta STARTLES jerking up so fast that her glasses fall off
her face Cage catches them before they hit the floor

CAGE (CONTD)
Whups - there you go

He hands them back Shasta looks at him eyes big as saucers

Hm Looks like the external memory
units been damaged on that thing -

SHASTA

CAGE

Cage produces the plastic Mylar baggie Shasta stares

CAGE (CONTD)

Yep That guy at the armory The
weird bald one who is always
hitting on you and makes you fill
out extra paperwork every time you
go over there so he can spend more
time totally creepin you out

(beat)
I got it off of him

SHASTA
Oh Wow

She looks at the dead unit shes been trying to fix -

CAGE
If you keep trying to repair that
thing its gonna take you all
afternoon A real pain in the butt
This could sure save you a lot of
time - and a visit to El Creepo

Cage smiles holding the bag Shasta eyes it desperate

SHASTA
What do you want for it

Cage points to the wall where three DENTED BATTLE AXES hang
Shasta searches the wall Cage couldnt possibly mean -

CAGE

I want an axe Youve got extra
SHASTA

Oh no You cant I mean thats

pure tungsten carbide monomer Its
over two hundred seventy kilos
Jackets arent made to carry a
weapon that heavy youd overload
the autobalancer -

CAGE
Ill take that as a compliment

INT LOCKER ROOM - RUBY TUESDAY - MORNING

EVERYONE is suiting up KIMMEL getting wedged into his
jacket SOLDIERS PACKING on ordinance But Cage is REMOVING
weapon after weapon dropping them to the floor

The number 203 is written on Cages hand

YONABURU
What the hell are you doing

Cage slips on his exojacket looking at his bare jacketed
arm flexing admiring it

CAGE
Lightening up Gettin sleek

YONABURU
What are you sposed to fight with

A DELIVERYMAN appears with a HANDTRUCK and a BATTLE AXE -

CAGE
This

Cage leans over picks up the battle axe and we CUT TO

EXT MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN - RUBY TUESDAY - AFTERNOON

Using the HUGE BATTLE AXE CAGE FIGHTS LIKE A BERSERKER
making short work of the mimic at hand and -

- LEADING the platoon to the crest of a hill HUNDREDS of
MIMIC below And theres SOMETHING ELSE with them -

GRIFF
Gawd-DAMN what the hell is THAT

The mimic horde parts clearing the way for SOMETHING SO BIG
that it takes a minute to stand upright unfolding itself

CAGE
(eyes narrowing)
Thats a Megareaver They bring
out sometimes Theyre big but
theyre slow

em

The MEGAREAVER stands over 30 tall and looks like a cross
between a MIMIC and a WALKING WARSHIP GLINTING in the rain

FORD
Crikey

LOFTING THE AXE Cage SCREAMS running STRAIGHT FOR IT -

- the MEGAREAVER ERUPTING with javelin fire even while its
raising its BLUDGEONING ARM which SWINGS DOWN -

CRASH Cage DIVING out of its way evading javelins LEAPING
onto the Megareavers leg CLAMBERING UP -

UNTIL HES ON THE THINGS BACK It REACHES for him -
CAGE CLEFTS AN ARM OFF the stump SPRAYING the horrible
blood everywhere the blood KILLING the MIMICS it touches
Then with some persistence Cage HACKS OFF THE HEAD

With a GURGLING ROAR the thing COLLAPSES disgorging what
look like UNDEVELOPED MIMICS all over the battleground

CAGE wipes his faceplate his armor STEAMING with the things
oily black blood He LIFTS his axe RALLYING the soldiers

CAGE
MOVE OUT

A THOUSAND SOLDIERS CHEER From the HEADS-UP view its
obvious that THEYVE WON THIS STAGE OF THE BATTLE

They push ONWARD shooting stragglers -

SGT FARELL (RADIO)
We got unconfirmed reports that
Sector Six is clear

CAGE
Yes sir it is sir Give us
everything you got for Sector Seven

SGT FARELL

hell taught you how to fight like

Cage RUNS LEADING THE MEN straight at the MIMIC HORDE
YONABURU by his side Cage FIGHTS deflecting shots aimed at
Yonaburu

ACROSS the PLATEAU the SUN starts streaking through the
clouds even though its STILL RAINING -

Cage dispatches mimics the whole area around them clearing

CAGE (CONTD)

YONABURU

BRIGHT sunlight all around them but THICK RAINDROPS falling
CAGE
Yeah Pretty cool huh They say

The world BLINKS OUT and BACK like a transmission getting
SEVERED Cage CRINGES - STAGGERS

CAGE (CONTD)
Its OW FUCK

Cages head It HURTS Its killing him

YONABURU
You OK buddy

CAGE
Something is ARGH

Cage falls to his knees his BATTLE-AXE clanging to the
ground He TEARS off his faceplate holding his head

CAGE (CONTD)
Oh no

The IMAGE SHUDDERS the SOUND WARBLING -
- and for a MILLISECOND Cage is -

BACK ON HIS BUNK IN THE BARRACKS THRASHING -

YONABURU
(in the barracks)
What the fuck is wrong with -
Cage SPASMS again and -

IS BACK ON THE BATTLEFIELD - on his KNEES

YONABURU (CONTD)
- fuck is wrong with you

Cages face is WRENCHED in pain hes helpless as more MIMIC
come streaming in taking out SOLDIERS

CAGE
Im sorry buddy I - ARGH

Cage COLLAPSES SPASMING and everything goes TUNNEL-VISION
STYLE BUZZING WARBLING -

— WHAM A MIMIC tackles Yonaburu PULLING limbs off like
youd pull the legs off a fly -

- CAGE lies on his back helpless dying as the world
BUZZES SHUDDERS and WINKS OUT

INT BARRACKS - DAY

Cage wakes up on his bunk holding his head He YELLS
ENRAGED KICKING THE WALL

CAGE
NO NO NO NO

Yonaburu scowls up

YONABURU
What the fuck is wrong with you

Cage looks around the barracks his lip twitching A trickle
of BLOOD coming out of his nose He wipes it away

CAGE
I die at 419 No matter what 419
is when I died the first time

A horrible sad realization coming over him
CAGE (CONTD)
Its just a loop It doesnt matter
what I do

YONABURU
What are you talking about

CAGE
How could I have been so stupid I
really thought I could win

YONABURU
Are you OK man

Cage walks through the barracks steps up on a footlocker

CAGE
Hey Everybody listen up

NO REACTION Cage GRABS Kimmels video game and SMASHES it on
the floor Everyone stares Cage clears his throat

CAGE (CONTD)

Uh good morning I wanted to let
you know that were all going to
die tomorrow Or at least most of
us will I definitely will

(beat)
So you should think like really
think about how youre going to
spend this day The more you
prepare yourself the harder you
try to be the best soldier you can
ever be the better youre going to
do tomorrow and for that matter
the better youre probably gonna
feel about whatever happens

Yonaburu covers his eyes painfully embarrassed

CAGE (CONTD)
Im sorry to bum everyone out but
you gotta trust me on this one
This is probably your last chance
to get it right

EVERYONE stares at Cage like hes crazy
CAGE (CONTD)
Oh and Sergeant Farell got out of
rehab early Hes coming down the
hall right now

EVERYONE flies into action

INT MESS HALL - DAY

Cage is eating by himself The rest of the platoon sits at
another table talking glancing this way clearly talking
about him

KIMMEL steps up looking nervous
KIMMEL
Hey I uh What you said back

there meant a whole lot man

The guy who can never fit into his suit is staring at Cage
with a mixture of awe and adoration

CAGE
Ah I was really just saying all
that Probably drank too much
metacoffee

Cage sips scowling at the taste

Kimmel sits watching Cage pile all manner of spicy sauce
salt syrup and whatever on the grossest pile of mixed-up
foods youve ever seen Its disgusting

CAGE (CONTD)
Gotta keep it interesting right

Cage eats 214 is written on the back of his hand

KIMMEL
Whats that for
CAGE
Its the number of times Ive seen

you die

(wiping his mouth)
Its OK we all do But you usually
dont even make it through the
drop The main problem is that
youre too fat They shouldnt have
let you in here But theyre out of
fit soldiers

Kimmel wants to get up but its too late -

CAGE (CONTD)

Dont feel bad about it That guy
Davis over there He wont ever
make it out of the drop ship And
Roker He ends up on fire cooked
in his own jacket How fucked up is
that And Ford he always manages
to lose one of his arms Sometimes
the left sometimes the right Its
the weirdest thing

(beat)

Nance on the other hand she just
totally freaks around the second
hour of battle Starts killing
everyone around her until we have
to take her down

KIMMEL
Uh I should probably go

Cage shakes his head smiling drinking more metacoffee

CAGE
You you usually just drown after
you run away
(chewing)
I dont think drownings all that
bad really

Kimmel looks like hes gonna be sick

KIMMEL
Uh Why are you telling me this

CAGE
Because its the one way Ive
figured to keep you from fighting
tomorrow after that speech I gave
Youre gonna get so freaked out
that youre gonna take a Section
Eight The guys from the infirmary
are coming in just now You should
get to know them

And in walk the INFIRMARY GUYS Kimmel looks

CUT TO

EXT RUBY TUESDAY - VARIOUS

IN THE DROPSHIP

Cage rides as in the opening but his face is grim He OPENS
his faceplate pulling out a flask of WHISKEY DRINKING in
the HOWLING WIND while FARELL SCREAMS at him

He offers it to the rest of the PLATOON they shake their
heads exchanging looks and CAGE JUMPS whiskey FLYING -

IN BATTLE

CAGE wanders the battlefield surrounded by the dead and
dying His RADIO is going wild He tunes it down until all
is silence replaced with sweeping sad music - maybe a
string quartet version of Metallicas NOTHING ELSE MATTERS
AT A RAVINE

Cage is filling a gulley full of mimics wounding them just
enough so they cant climb out Hes clearly DRUNK

BARRELS of fuel oil dump into the ravine The mimics are
screeching to get out

He lights a match to the bottle of whiskey and THROWS it
face LIT UP with the HELLISH GLOW
He looks TOTALLY INSANE
AT A DROPSHIP LANDING SORTIE
Cage JUMPS from dropship to dropship like Super Mario
climbing into the sky way out over the ocean At the highest
one he SWAN DIVES -
- DOWN DOWN INTO THE WATER SPLASH He turns drifting down

looking up at the dead and dying the WAR MACHINES and MIMICS
and MEN hitting the water and floating down -

Cages PRESSURE METER going up and up until -

ON A SHARP PEAK

Cage RUNS at high speed hauling a MIMIC up a hill LEAPING -
- grabbing a STRIKEJET HAULING the mimic bodily along

forcing the jet into a NEEDLE SHOT straight up ABOVE THE
CLOUDS AND STORM -

- AND ABOVE THE ATMOSPHERE where he can see the BLACK EDGE
OF SPACE and the setting sun

The mimic ICES OVER and finally EXPLODES Cage lets go of the
rocket floating in low-earth orbit ITS BEAUTIFUL

His faceplate ices over ALARMS going off Cage opens his
faceplate THE VOID RUSHES IN AND WE

CUT TO

EXT BATTLEFIELD - RUBY TUESDAY

BLAM A little VIDEO-GAME FIGHTER EXPLODES in a comically
violent way GAME OVER YOUR SCORE IS 943943925 RESTART -

Cage wanders the field of battle playing KIMMELS HAND-HELD
VIDEO GAME paying little attention to the battle at hand

Whenever a mimic comes near Cage DISPATCHES it without even
looking up from the game

FINALLY one manages to make him drop the game Cage gets
ANGRY He throws himself into a HORDE of mimics

CAGE is a DEATH DEALER killing without purpose rhyme or
reason standing on a GROWING PILE of dead mimic but MORE
and MORE COME hell be buried soon when -

WHAM a HUGE-ASS mimic slides into several pieces as -
- RITA leaps into the fray fighting alongside Cage

Cage matches her moves swing for swing Cage has never
fought this close to her before

RITA lands striking a pose Her radio CRACKLES -

RITA
So Its Cage huh Your jacket
says youre a Private You sure
dont fight like a Private

CAGE
I play a lot of video games

RITA
Youre pretty good

CAGE
Pretty good

Cage FLIES into action killing SIX MIMIC with one complex
and insane ballet-like stroke showing off for RITA

RITA
Your one weakness is that you fight
like nothing matters Something
always matters

She demonstrates Its like her focus is always on whats
next like she doesnt really hate the mimic one way or
another - there is a beauty efficiency in it

Cage hammers a few mimics back Clumsy by comparison

CAGE
Ive tried to fight like you I
cant

RITA

Try Dont think about whats next
Forget about what just happened

She swings effortlessly dispatching more
RITA (CONTD)
You fight with your eyes Youve

got to fight with your heart

Cage tries The improvement is immediate Mimic go flying as
they fight together They are a perfect team

Soon Mimic litter the field Smoke clears Rita smiles

RITA (CONTD)
Not too bad at all private

CAGE
Well thanks for the lesson But I
gotta go die now

Cage turns to leave TWO MORE MIMIC head his way -

RITA
Private Cage Ive got a question

- SLASH SLASH Cage FLIPS dispatching two at once

RITA (CONTD)
How many loops is this for you

Cage TURNS STUNNED His axe falls clattering to the ground

CAGE
What did you just say

He stares at her in total shock Rita smiles

RITA
I said how many - HEADS UP

A MEGAREAVER CHARGES SWINGING its CUTTING ARM and -

- the world BUZZES falling apart the IMAGE of Rita killing
the Megareaver SHATTERING INTO FRAGMENTS as we -

the morning breeze Two HORSES nicker and prance by a barn
and above the sky is BRIGHT BLUE hardly a cloud

RITA VRATASKI is lying on her bed watching the sky the
horses Ritas bed is in the middle of this wheat field

She sits up rubbing the sleep out of her eyes Looks like
she didnt sleep too well

With some regret Rita taps a button and the horses FREEZE
the grain STOPS WAVING The HOLOVID IMAGE fades revealing -

INT RITAS TOWER - MONDAY MORNING

- the UDF MILITARY BASE the OCEAN and operations going on
below and out into the distance

NOW Rita BREWS COFFEE carefully pouring steaming water over
fresh grounds yawning in her pyjamas

The coffee brewed she holds her cup like its precious
looking out at the base until a grating BUZZER goes off

LT HOLSTROM (INTERCOM)
Knock knock

LT HOLSTROM AKA CHIEF BREEDER enters clipboard in hand

LT HOLSTROM (CONTD)
Good morning Valkyrie One

RITA
Hey CB Whatve you got for me

Holstrom produces a HOLODISK The room darkens and now -

STRATEGIC MAPS of the ISLAND the BATTLE hover around them
the ocean and the base still dimly visible through the glass

Holstrom debriefs Rita HILLS and TERRAIN and MIMIC
CONCENTRATIONS spin and move She takes it all in drinking

RITA (CONTD)
Let me see the Sector Three ridge
display again

CRAGGY PEAKS come into view dotted with MILITARY SYMBOLS
Holstrom watches Ritas face closely as she thinks

She focuses mind going somewhere else

RITA (CONTD)
Theyre probably going to hit the
rear divisions Here and here

LT HOLSTROM
TAC-COM ran the simulations and see
a low probability of a rear attack -

RITA

Then tell them their simulations
are wrong

(focusing)

Theyll be in the mountains Along
this plateau A lot of them By
late afternoon they

She trails off frowning

RITA (CONTD)
After that Im not getting
anything else

Now Holstrom frowns worried

BEAT

HOLSTROM
Nothing What does that mean
RITA
I dont know Its probably
nothing
HOLSTROM

What should I tell command

RITA
Tell them Im taking a walk

HOLSTROM
TAC-COM prefers it if you dont
leave the tower the day before

CRIMSON EXOJACKET hangs battered but battle-ready
for the leg which is MESSILY OPEN -

RILEY hunkers over the leg removing the external
unit all pigtails overalls Coke-bottle glasses -

RITA
Morning Shasta Hows it going

startles dropping her glasses

SHASTA
OH Hi I uh were having some
trouble with the anterior memory
unit on V9 but Im sure Ill have
it fixed by this afternoon if you -

RITA
I just came to see if you wanted to
get some breakfast
Shasta smiles always rabbit-nervous bites her lip

SHASTA
Id uh really love to but I I
have to get this unit fixed before
tomorrow I knew I should have just
ordered a fresh one

Rita wanders looking at Shastas messy table finding a
cheap plastic figurine of HERSELF RITA VALKYRIE ONE

RITA
Whats this

SHASTA
(embarrassed)
Just something I got off base I
uh think its from New Taiwan

Rita picks up the figurine Theres a whole playset

JACKET WEAPONRY

RITA
God The boobs are terrible How
would I ever fit in a jacket

SHASTA
I know Its kinda weird I
shouldnt have bought it

RITA
No Its cool Its funny

Rita puts the figurine back on the shelf
She stares up at her empty exojacket thinking

RITA (CONTD)
I wanted to say that if
anything happens tomorrow that
youve been a great engineer I
couldnt do what I do without you

SHASTA
Is everything OK

RITA
Im just feel a little weird today
Thats all

Worried Shasta watches her go

EXT TRAINING FIELD - DAY

Rita walks watching PLATOONS OF INFANTRY train Her DOGS in
loose formation around her An army photographer catches up
festooned with cameras snapping pictures -

PHOTOGRAPHER
Give us a smile Major Come on
Big battle tomorrow huh How many
mimics you think youre gonna kill

But Ritas focus is elsewhere She notices CAGES PLATOON
fucking up an obstacle course in every conceivable way

RITA
What are they doing

HOLSTROM
Thats 3rd Platoon 301st division
Conscripts Never finished basic
Theyre the worst maam

RITA
Everyone gotta start somewhere

AT THE OBSTACLE COURSE

NANCE and FORD power over a wall Nance taking the
opportunity to GRAB his ass They FALL in the mud kicking

FORD
HEY

NANCE AND FORD SQUARE OFF a throng forming -

SGT FARELL
BACK OFF NOW

NANCE
I think Im gonna kill you Fordy
Right now Fronta everyone

They start SWINGING just as -

- RITA pushes through the HOOTING THRONG NANCE lands a
PERFECT PUNCH on FORD He staggers twists and SWINGS BACK -

Rita goes to catch his fist but in a microsecond notices -

- CAGE standing in the throng watching HER instead of the
fight Rita hesitates and still catches Fords fist -

- but the force of his blow THROWS them both around his fist
grazing her cheek just as she sends him SPRAWLING -

The Dogs step forward to intervene -

RITA
Hold it Shep

Rita wipes blood off her lip Offers her hand to Ford

RITA (CONTD)
You got a good right hook soldier

NOW
The soldiers hold their ISO-PUSHUPS in a perfect line

Rita walks the line of soldiers the PHOTOGRAPHER snapping
pictures from a safe distance A few of the Dogs hunker over
the straining soldiers GRINNING EVILLY at their torture

RITA (CONTD)
A jacket cant protect you from a
mimic Only your mind can The mind
is the greatest weapon you have In
the end it is your only weapon

One of the soldiers CAGE keeps staring at her His
expression very serious almost angry

Beside Cage Yonaburu COLLAPSES struggling to get back up

SGT FARELL
GET BACK UP PRIVATE

RITA
This mans had enough

SGT FARELL
Yes maam

Yonaburu gets up arms trembling DOG SOLDIERS smirk Rita
notices Cage staring up at her again

She drops into a perfect iso-pushup right next to Cage When
she looks over Cage is looking her dead in the eye

RITA
Is there something on my face
soldier

CAGE
(quietly)
Youre a very difficult person to
get to It took me sixteen tries
before I remembered how to do this
one

RITA
Do I know you

CAGE
You dont recognize me

RITA
Ive never seen you before in my
life soldier

Cage frowns He didnt expect that

CAGE
I need to talk to you In private

Rita frowns noticing that 329 is written on Cages hand

RITA
Ill make you a deal If you can
hold the position longer than me
you can say whatever you want

CAGE
Fine

THE SUN BEATS DOWN One by one soldiers drop until only
Cage and Rita are left

Two DOG soldiers keep time shaking their heads Theyve
never seen Rita or anyone else hold an iso-pushup this
long A CROWD of SOLDIERS gather gawking

Cage and Rita STRAIN to hold the position sweat dripping

RITA
You had enough

CAGE
I dont think so

But Cage cant take it anymore With a YELL he drops Ritas
Dogs WHOOP -

SHEP
CALAMITY DAWG WINS OOH RAH

Rita gets up dusts her hands off Looks down at Cage -

RITA
Its too bad Now I wanna know what
it was you had to say But a deals
a deal

Rita turns to walk away surrounded by her celebrating men
Yonaburu comes over helping Cage up
YONABURU
Damn that was some crazy shit
man I never —-

Cage PUSHES into the throng after Rita

CAGE
HEY RITA WAIT

In a millisecond CAGE is on the dirt two of the DOGS on top
of him his wrists behind him Cage spits dirt

CAGE (CONTD)
I got an answer to your question
Three hundred twenty-nine

Rita turns frowning

RITA
Three hundred twenty-nine what

CAGE
Days since we met Times Ive died
Times Ive woken up again

Ritas eyes go WIDE

RITA

What did you just say private
CAGE

You said it was You called it

Rita STARES dumbstruck

RITA
Let him go

EVERYONE stares Even the Dogs look perplexed

Cage gets up dusting himself off giving one of the DOGS a
violent look

CAGE
Now you mind telling me just what
the hell is going on

EXT TRAINING FIELD - BY THE WATER COOLERS - DAY

Yonaburu DRINKS staring across the field to where Cage and
Rita WALK trailed at a distance by the DOGS

GRIFF
Dude What do you think theyre
talkin about

YONABURU
No freakin idea

EXT BASE - AT THE FENCE - DAY

Rita walks in silence face hard as stone until theyre well
away from the onlookers

RITA
I guess you have a lot of
questions

She looks at Cages hand again The numbers on it Tears
begin rolling down her face

CAGE
Are you uh OK

RITA
Yeah I just thought I was the only
one it had ever happened to

CAGE
Are you in the loop with me

RITA
No I got out

CAGE
Theres a way out

Rita looks out through the fence at the ocean

RITA
It was in the Battle of Florida
Id lied about my age when I joined
up I didnt know the first thing
about being a soldier

CUT TO

EXT RITAS MEMORY - VARIOUS

IN THE BATTLE OF FLORIDA JACKETED INFANTRY FIGHT MIMIC BY
THE THOUSAND We fly over the battle finding -

- RITAS PLATOON Shes clearly way too young to be here
keeping close to her Captain LT ARTHUR HENDRICKS a good-
looking fatherly man in his late 30s -

RITA (VO)
We didnt have a chance in hell
but I was lucky my Lieutenant was
looking out for me He kept me
alive while everyone else in my
platoon got shredded

They FIGHT side by side -

- but then LT HENDRICKS goes DOWN KILLED by a mimic with an
ODD RAINBOW-LIKE SHEEN -

RITA (VO) (CONTD)
He died trying to save me
I lost my head and went after the
mimic that killed him

The YOUNG RITA HUNTS DOWN the MIMIC enabled by REVENGE and
FURY alone Her EXOJACKET is TORN HALF AWAY when she finally
KILLS the thing using her PILEDRIVER -

RITA (VO) (CONTD)
I killed it And then I died

- SHE DIES in the QUICKSILVER BLOOD of the ANTENNA MIMIC We
see the image fall apart then RITA WAKES UP -

IN HER BARRACKS screaming in her hammock People STARE

RITA (VO) (CONTD)
I woke up the day before the battle
had even started I thought Id
gone crazy

RITA wanders the barracks like a ghost -

RITA (VO) (CONTD)
I must have died twenty times
before I pulled myself together and
decided to stand and fight

ON THE BATTLEFIELD RITA HAMMERS mimics with a REPEATER
RIFLE SNARLING as she is CUT DOWN in a SPRAY OF RED -

RITA (VO) (CONTD)
After a while I got better

We see LT HENDRICKS die a VARIETY of DEATHS RITA WEEPING
over some of them FIGHTING through the rest

RITA (VO) (CONTD)
I was in four hundred eleven
battles before I figured out how to
break out of the loop

ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE Rita now fights with a BATTLEAXE -

- when she sees a RAINBOW MIMIC the first one she killed
just like the one Cage killed streaking across the field -

Her eyes NARROW she RUNS AFTER IT and we

CUT TO

EXT BASE - BY THE FENCE
CAGES FACE desperate to know -

CAGE
How

RITA
The first time you died Tell me
exactly what happened

CAGE
Id been hit You were there You
took my battery This big mimic
came up Kinda rainbow colored
It was going to shoot you in back
I killed it It bled on me I died
(beat)
It was uh pretty awful

RITA
Do you remember what it was doing
when it when you died

CAGE
(frowning)
Yeah This stuff was coming of
it like little wires Ive never
seen one of them do that

RITA
You killed an Antenna While it was
broadcasting

(MORE)

RITA (CONTD)
When you killed that mimic you got
tangled up in the signal Became a
receiver Just like I did

CAGE
I what

Rita smiles

RITA
Its probably easier if I show you

CUT TO

INT HOLOBAY - BATTLEVIDS
A SINGLE JACKETED HUMAN fights a MIMIC we pull BACK to a -

SPY-SAT AERIAL VIEW of a BATTLE in PROGRESS THOUSANDS of
MIMIC flood across a field engaging with THOUSANDS OF
HUMANS but we pull FARTHER BACK -

RITA
You ever wonder why the mimic
almost always know where were
going to strike next

- until all that we can see are hundreds of thousands of BLUE
and RED DOTS converging dissolving repeating almost like a
mathematical equation on abstracted 3-D terrain

Ritas face is dimly illuminated in the holobay

RITA (CONTD)
Look

BLUE DOTS head to a position But RED DOTS get there first

RITA (CONTD)
Do you see the pattern

CAGE
No

RITA
Let me speed it up

NOW the battle scuds by at high speed the mimics POUR onto
the human defense forces like SAND settling shifting -

RITA (CONTD)
Watch the movements

And a pattern emerges ONE SMALL CHANGE then EVERYTHING
flows in a new direction Pulsing from RANDOM ACTION to
FOCUSED ORDER

RITA (CONTD)
Now Slow it down on that point

She scuds back and forth across a SHIFT ZOOMING in

RITA (CONTD)
The shift happens each time an
Antenna gets killed

-we zoom in to see a single MIMIC getting killed by a
single SOLDIER But at that moment the whole mimic strategy -
like grains of sand at the wider zoom - abruptly SHIFTS

RITA (CONTD)
When an Antenna dies it sends out
a message To the receivers

One RED DOT winks out But the BLUE dot finds itself
surrounded TRAPPED

RITA (CONTD)
But the message travels backwards
Into the past
Nine red dots CONVERGE The blue dot is EXTINGUISHED

The action REWINDS the BLUE DOT moving back from the RED
DOT until earlier several RED DOTS move from their cohort -

- ALREADY HEADING FOR THE PLACE WHERE THE ANTENNA WILL DIE

RITA (CONTD)
Its a perfect strategy when you
think about it You dont have to
outsmart an enemy if you always
know what theyre going to do next

Nine red dots CONVERGE Again the blue dot is EXTINGUISHED

CAGE
So when I killed the Antenna and
it bled on me I became a
receiver And now Im picking up
messages from

RITA
-yourself thirty-six hours from
now Like memories but of the
future Every possible future will
play out until you break the loop

CAGE
How

RITA
We have to find the Antenna you
killed The one that bled on you
Before you killed it Before it
sent the broadcast

CAGE
And kill it

RITA
We have to get the receivers too
or it wont work at all But yeah
Thats the idea

Cage nods his head swimming

CAGE
Thats it That sounds almost easy

RITA
Its not Theyll know were
coming Theyll do whatever they
need to kill you every time
(beat)
They know how important you are

Cage frowns

CAGE
What do you mean

RITA
If you break the loop the mimic
wont be able to tell what happens
next
(beat)
Youll be able to win the battle

Cages eyes go wide Rita smiles

On the holovid STREAMS and EDDIES of MIMIC overpower human
forces over and over in a constant loop

EXT BASE - NIGHT

The STARS are bright above as Cage and Rita walk across the
base The DOGS trail behind them keeping their distance

CAGE
I cant believe Im really going to
be free tomorrow

RITA
(smiling)
Youll still be in the UDF

ACROSS THE ROAD OFFICERS enjoy final drinks at the PX Cage
can see the tail end of his PLATOON sneaking around back

CAGE
Yeah but no more headaches no
more loop Ill get my life back

Ritas expression goes distant

RITA

Yeah But I should warn you I
think being in the loop did
something to me Sometimes I still
pick up fragments Feelings
little things the day before a
battle Like I can pretty much tell
if someones going to die

(beat)
Its why I dont really talk to
anyone the day before battle

They come to a crossroad Ritas tower is one way C-Company
barracks the other

RITA (CONTD)
You should get your sleep Its
going to be a pretty big day

CAGE
I was wondering - your lieutenant
the one who helped you Were you
ever able to save him

A terrible sadness crosses Ritas face

RITA
No
(beat)
I think there are some people you
cant save no matter what

Rita turns and walks away

From the shadows a couple Dogs give Private Cage the last of
their suspicious looks and fall in line behind her

INT BARRACKS - NIGHT

Yonaburu is slumped on the floor drunk Cage stares at
Yonaburu thinking about what Rita said

YONABURU
Well here he is Mr Bigshot talking
to the Valkyrie all day She tell
you how were gonna win this thing

victorious SOLDIERS engaging the MIMIC in groups -

The last three RECEIVERS converge to protect the ANTENNA

CAGE (CONTD)

Rita LANDS in front of the ANTENNA MIMIC its iridescent
rainbow-slick armor glistening in the AFTERNOON SUN

It pauses and then RUNS Rita CHASES the thing deflecting
blows right and left Its DAMN GOOD FASTER than the rest

Every time Rita lets up TINY BLACK TENDRILS exude from the
mimics armor Its trying to BROADCAST -

Cage HAMMERS the last receivers dodging and weaving hacking
down ONE then ANOTHER while RITA and the ANTENNA FIGHT -

- it suddenly PUNCHES back sending RITA FLYING then JUMPS
landing right over her

RITA
CAGE

CAGE

Cage SPINS IN AIR twisting down as the final RECEIVER fires
multiple javelins everything goes SLOW as his body moves in
just the right configuration to evade every one -

- then he BRINGS his axe down The last receiver is DEAD

CAGE (CONTD)
All clear

He sees the ANTENNA standing over RITA tendrils waving -

- and with a BATTLE CRY Cage HURLS himself at the thing and
in a blur of ARMOR AXE and MIMIC -

Cage stands in low battle stance

The ANTENNA MIMIC slides into six pieces The pieces fizzle
crackling Cage steps away from the boiling blood

Its over Rita gets up

CAGE (CONTD)

RITA
We still have to go win this thing

Cage opens his faceplate Rita opens hers feeling the rain

EXT BASE - RITAS TOWER - MORNING
Ritas glass tower glints in the morning light

The DOGS are assembled around the base of Ritas tower
having just finished breakfast TWO of them are SCUFFLING
for fun while the others egg them on

One of them - picking his teeth with a bowie knife - looks
up noticing -

- CAGE walking this way HIGH-NOON STYLE

HEELER

Cage TEARS into the Dogs like a MAN POSSESSED fighting them
ALL AT ONCE eyes steady on the door to Ritas tower

The Dogs have been in battle 20 30 times Cage almost 400
Even without his jacket Cage is pretty much unstoppable

IN SECONDS all the Dogs are on the ground

INT BASE OF RITAS TOWER - MORNING

Cage walks in dusty wiping blood off his lip looking
around An EXECUTIVE OFFICER frowns up at him and -

- Rita comes out of nowhere SWINGING

CAGE
RITA WAIT

But Rita ATTACKS hyperfast Cage can barely deflect her
blows She sends him CRASHING down Cage spins fights back -

- but hes no match for her In seconds shes on top of him
hand on windpipe fist cocked and ready to kill -

CAGE

Rita sees that 393 is written on Cages hand
Ritas EYES GO WIDE -

She lets go jumping back like she touched a live wire Cage
starts COUGHING The DOGS stare totally confused

HOLSTROM walks in cocking his gun leveled at Cage
LT HOLSTROM

Cage slowly salutes at attention
CAGE

permission to speak with Sergeant-
Major Vrataski In private

Rita nods Holstrom hesitates Stands down

CAGE

Before I died

Rita nods wiping her nose

RITA

show you how

CAGE
You already did

She stops looking him in the eye suspicious

RITA
Then why are you here

Cage hesitates He cant tell her the truth

CAGE
Because uh at the last minute
I didnt kill the Antenna We
wanted to come back Spend the day
together just one more time

RITA
Oh I see

Rita eyes Cage wondering just what she and this Private have
been doing in his past in her future

CAGE

(seeing)
Sweet Jesus on a mountain

Cage and Rita enter the mess hall together followed by the
Dogs who look just as confused as everyone else

CAGE AND RITA STAND IN LINE
The SERVERS try not to stare at them lumping chow

CAGE

Rita doesnt know what to say She looks nervous like shes
on her first date

CAGE (CONTD)

know everything about me

CAGE

kill mimics Im pretty good at
that You said so yourself

Rita smiles uncomfortably They eat

CAGE (CONTD)
One thing I could never figure was -
why do you come eat with us No one
in their right mind would eat this
crap if they didnt have to

RITA
I have to do something that makes
me feel like myself I kinda got
used to it

Cage pours chocolate sauce over a pile of pickled eggs

CAGE
This is my favorite lately
Pickled egg chocolate surprise

Cage digs in Rita tries some She smiles Not bad

RITA
Loop food Brings back memories
What about

Rita piles hot sauce on top of her oatmeal adding what looks
like canned sardines Cage winces She offers He tries it

CAGE
Not bad Kinda Smoky

Everyone is staring at them Cage takes another bite washes
it down with a big swig of metacoffee Rita winces

RITA
How do you drink that stuff

CAGE

Their eyes meet Rita suddenly starts laughing Cage too All
the anxious worry coming off of them Now everyone is REALLY
staring Cage leans in -

CAGE (CONTD)
You wanna get out of here

EXT BASE - DAY

RUMORS visibly SPREAD around base SOLDIERS going out of
their way to stare at the pair as they walk the DOGS behind

CAGE
(under his breath)

Cage takes Ritas hand PULLS her around a corner RUNNING -

EXT BASE - BY THE FENCE

- down an alley losing the Dogs finding THE HOLE IN THE
FENCE right where Palka always makes it

CAGE
Come on

EXT BEACH - DAY

GULLS CAW waves CRASH on the shore Rita and Cage walk
stealing glances at each other A sweet tension between them

RITA
So when we uh decided to not kill
the Antenna and come back were
we like

CAGE
We uh just kissed It all
happened pretty fast

Rita pushes her hair back No ones around

RITA
I want to know what it was like

CAGE
Uh OK

They kiss Nervous and tender Its possible that Ritas
never kissed anyone before in her adult life

RITA
That was nice

CAGE
Yeah

RITA

It was weird too

CAGE
Yeah I guess it must be

Rita looks out at the ocean feeling complicated

RITA
Whyd you join up

CAGE
I got drafted I tried everything I
could to get out of it And now
here I am
(beat)
The last time you told me you
lied about your age to get in Why

RITA

I was sixteen A farm girl The
town I grew up in mimic scouts
came up river some hunters found
them They burned my town I lost
everything - my dad my mom My
horse

(beat)
I guess I joined the marines
because I didnt want to live
anymore I figured if I could kill
just one mimic that would be
enough and then I could die I
dont know what I was thinking But
I was lucky There was this man
Lieutenant Arthur Hendricks He
found me Showed me how to use my
jacket

CAGE
Were you in love with him

A painful look crosses her face

CAGE (CONTD)
Im sorry you just seem really
sad about it

RITA
Its OK Yeah Im pretty sure I
was in love with him

CUT TO FLASHBACK

Rita trains with ARTHUR HENDRICKS Hes handsome late-30s
warmth in him not undone by the years of battle

Then hes showing her pictures of his WIFE and CHILD She
looks at him like a girl in love

RITA (VO) (CONTD)
I think he loved me too But he had
a family so it was different we
never even talked about it And
besides there waS a war on

WE SEE HER WINNING THE FINAL BATTLE soldiers CHEERING in the
smoke while she WEEPS over the body of ARTHUR HENDRICKS -

RITA (VO) (CONTD)
No matter how I played it I could
never save him He was the real
hero of that battle He died and I
got a medal No one ever knew

- and then ON A STAGE getting the Valkyrie Medal of Honor
draped around her neck It means nothing to her

WE CUT BACK TO

Rita sitting in the sand the same expression on her face
She wipes away a tear

RITA (CONTD)
When I finally got out of the loop
all I wanted was to get back in To
have one more chance to save him
(beat)
Id have traded the whole battle
for it

Cage looks at her not sure what to say
CAGE
Im really sorry I think maybe

some people are just fated

RITA
Yeah Maybe so

She looks at Cage

RITA (CONTD)
Would you kiss me again

CAGE
Yeah

They lie back On the distant shore the low THUMP and GLOW
of ARTILLERY hammering the far-off island and we CUT TO

INT RITAS BUNK - DAWN - RUBY TUESDAY

Cage opens his eyes The morning sky is bright blue overhead
Hes in Ritas bed And her bed -

- appears to be in a WHEAT FIELD Cage sits up disoriented

CAGE
Where are we

RITA
Pennsylvania The farm where I grew
up We had the bluest skies youve
ever seen
(beat)
Its just an old holovid But I
wanted you to see it

CAGE
Its really beautiful

Rita smiles a little sadly and gets up in her pyjamas
The holovid FREEZES distorts and fades replaced by -
- the thick polycarbonate glass of Ritas tower

Cage stares out at the island the distant shelling
preparations for todays battle in progress far below

A grinder WHIRS water BOILS GROUNDS go into a brewing pot

CAGE (CONTD)
Whats that

RITA
Its coffee Real coffee Some of
the last in the world

She adds water the dark brew drizzles into the pot

CAGE
I thought that stuff was extinct

RITA

Almost Theres an island off the
coast of Africa - one of the last
places itll grow I fought there
once and they still have it flown
in for me It doesnt seem right
that I should have it all to
myself

She pours some into his cup Cage drinks His eyes go wide
CAGE

Thats uh nothing like the stuff
they have in the mess hall

RITA
Its probably the best cup of
coffee you can get in the whole
world I mean since no one gets to
make coffee anymore You have to do
it just right or its no good

CAGE
Youll have to show me how
sometime

RITA
(sadly)
Id like that

Rita looks down at her coffee

RITA (CONTD)
I was wondering The last time
we were in the loop You said we
decided not to kill the Antenna

CAGE
Uh no But dont worry Well get
out this time

She searches his face She knows hes lying

RITA
Well Im glad we decided to come
back

CAGE

They kiss holding each other Cage looks out at the
beautiful vista smiling but something is flying this -

WHAM A MIMIC JAVELIN HITS THE TOWER

ANOTHER VOLLEY STREAKS IN - WHAM WHAM Cage and Rita are
THROWN to the floor her tower SHUDDERING with the impact

The polycarbonate fractures spider-thin cracks working their
way across the room - but it HOLDS

Cage picks himself off the floor stunned

ALARMS start going off BELOW THEM the BASE is getting
HAMMERED by MIMIC JAVELINS -

- SOLDIERS run like ants on an upended mound as MIMIC ERUPT
beneath them the beaches DARK with MIMIC crawling from the
SEA - CARRIERS and DROPSHIPS engulfed in flame -

CAGE (CONTD)
What the hell

RITA
The mimic are attacking early They

SWINGING just as the MIMIC reach him SHUCK The mimics FALL -

AND THE BATTLE IS ON

of the war-torn base

RITA
There And there Do you see them

NINE RED DOTS are flagged WHITE

CAGE
Nine of ‘em check

RITA
We dont have much time

Cage kills a RECEIVER - WHAM RITA kills ANOTHER - WHAM
Their moves in perfect mirror images of each other

ONE TWO THREE mimic receivers go down Everyone goes down a
different way Each one is harder to kill than the last

The ANTENNA always WATCHING RETREATING HIDING -

The last two receivers TAKE FLIGHT Cage and Rita HUNT them
down merciless and unstoppable finding themselves in -

THE SMOLDERING CRATER OF THE MESS HALL

The RAINBOW-COLORED ANTENNA MIMIC SCUTTLING into the
WRECKAGE Rita HEAVES back a hunk of smoking DROPSHIP -

- the ANTENNA MIMIC LEAPS knocking her back and is ON CAGE
in a FLASH CAGE FIGHTS BACK but this mimic knows his every
move A SCREECHING BLUR of LIMBS and JAVELINS firing

Cage is KNOCKED BACK WHAM WHAM BLOOD hits the inside of
his PLATE as he GOES DOWN -

As the blood beads and trickles off Cage looks up at the
spinning BARREL of the mimics JAVELIN ARM

Its going to kill him now

WHACK Rita hits it from the side The ANTENNA flies through
the air in SLOW MOTION tendrils FLARING -

- AS ACROSS THE BASE

THOUSANDS OF MIMIC STOP ATTACKING SOLDIERS are left
scratching their heads as mimic DETACH racing across the
base to ONE POINT to the MESS HALL CRATER -

BACK WITH CAGE AND RITA

- where the Antenna LANDS and LAUNCHES ITSELF at RITA their
BLOWS KEEPING THEM BOTH AIRBORNE until -

It KICKS RITAS FACEPLATE SHATTERING IT She SCREAMS losing
grip on her axe -

RITA FALLS TO THE GROUND The AXE falling nearby JAVELINS
pepper the area until a HUNK OF DROPSHIP FALLS ACROSS HER
LEG PINNING HER TO THE GROUND -

The MIMIC LANDS standing over her VIBRATING with POWER -

- its JAVELIN ARM leveled at Ritas unprotected face
She glares up at it gritting her teeth

RITA (CONTD)
DO IT YOU BASTARD

An ELECTRICAL ARC ZAPS between the mimic and Rita then the
Antenna mimic CHITTERS the WHIRRING stops

Then it BACKS AWAY looking for Cage -

RITA (CONTD)
No

- the MIMIC whirls too late WHAM Cages AXE swings CUTS
into the mimic BLACK BLOOD FLYING but its not DEEP ENOUGH

The MIMIC SCREECHES fighting back in a BLUR but Cage BLOCKS
its every strike With no other option the mimic starts to
SHUDDER a tachyon charge building -

- Cage SWINGS and the MIMIC falls CRACKLING SHORTING OUT -
DEAD

Cage is on his knees exhausted ALARMS going off in Cages
heads-up THOUSANDS of mimic will be here any second

He goes to RITA opening his faceplate

CAGE
Are you OK

RITA

Cage STRAINS lifting the fallen piece of dropship and
freeing her helping her up

RITA (CONTD)

CAGE
We dont have much time You have
to get out of here Killing the
Antenna it doesnt work We

CAGE (CONTD)

Rita SWINGS hitting Cage with the flat of the axe - KNOCKING
CAGE BACK 20 YARDS He sits up holding his jaw

CAGE
What the hell was that for

RITA

She walks towards Cage He scrambles back

She looks up at the crater rim her heads-up thick with on-
rushing mimic coming from every angle

RITA (CONTD)

CAGE

RITA
Whatever the loop did to me it
turned me into a receiver

She SWINGS her axe Cage ROLLS -

RITA (CONTD)

CAGE

Rita shakes her head coughs smiling
RITA

CAGE

The image DISTORTS SPUTTERS one last time - and is NORMAL
The rain is coming down The sun is shining

Cage stands picking up Ritas axe wiping his face He looks
at the MIMIC HORDE He raises the axe and RUNS into the horde
with a BATTLE CRY

CAGE (VO) (CONTD)
Rita was right About everything

We see Cages HEADS-UP blinking RED but as he fights we see
the onrushing FRONTS of mimic FRACTURE EDDY as -

ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE

SOLDIERS UNDER ATTACK watch as SOME MIMIC start running in
the wrong direction OTHERS even start attacking each other

CAGE (VO) (CONTD)

At first a few stopped working
right But pretty soon they just
fell apart

Farell watches as everywhere the mimic fall into CHAOS Some
still attack but the synchronous VOLLEYS the ORDERED FRONT
LINES are gone

From ordered WAVES to SWARMS to NOISE

The SKY is a HELLISH RED as CAGE CLEANS UP The look in his
eyes - insane with grief exhaustion He doesnt stop

CAGE (VO) (CONTD)
I kept fighting long after the
battle was over

EXT BASE - WEDNESDAY MORNING

In the EARLY MORNING LIGHT the BASE is smoking ruined CAGE
