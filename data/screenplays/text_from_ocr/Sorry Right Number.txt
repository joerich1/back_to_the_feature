ACT 1

FADE IN ON

KATIE WEIDERMANS MOUTH ECU

Shes speaking into the telephone Pretty mouth in a few seconds
well see that the rest of her is just as pretty

KATIE
Bill Oh he says he doesnt feel
very well but hes always like that

between books cant sleep thinks
every headache is the first symptom
of a brain tumor once he gets going

on something new hell be fine
SOUND BG THE TELEVISION

THE CAMERA DRAWS BACK KATIE is sitting in the kitchen phone nook
having a good gab with her sister while she idles through some
catalogues We should notice one not-quite-ordinary thing about
the phone shes on its the sort with two lines There are
LIGHTED BUTTONS to show which ones are engaged Right now only
one- KATIES- is As KATIE CONTINUES HER CONVERSATION THE CAMERA
SWINGS AWAY FROM HER TRACKS ACROSS THE KITCHEN and through the
arched doorway that leads into the family room

KATIE (voice fading)
Oh I saw Janie Charlton today yes
Big as a house

She fades The TV gets louder There are three kids JEFF eight
CONNIE ten and DENNIS thirteen Wheel Of Fortune is on but
theyre not watching Instead theyre engaged in that great
pastime Fighting About What Comes On Later

JEFF
Come onnn It was his first book

CONNIE
His first gross book

DENNIS
Were gonna watch Cheers and Wings
just like we do every week Jeff
DENNIS speaks with the utter finality only a big brother can
manage Wanna talk about it some more and see how much pain I can
inflict on your scrawny body Jeff his face says

JEFF
Could we at least tape it

CONNIE
Were taping CNN for Mom She said she
might be on the phone with Aunt Lois
for quite awhile

JEFF
How can you tape CNN for Gods sake
It never stops

DENNIS
Thats what she likes about it

CONNIE
And dont say Gods sake Jeffie- youre
not old enough to talk about God except
in church

JEFF
Then dont call me Jeffie

CONNIE
Jeffie Jeffie Jeffie

JEFF gets up walks to the window and looks out into the dark
Hes really upset DENNIS and CONNIE in the grand tradition of
older brothers and sisters are delighted to see it

DENNIS
Poor Jeffie

CONNIE
I think hes gonna commit suicide

JEFF (turns to them)
It was his first book Dont you guys
even care

CONNIE
Rent it down at the Video Stop tomorrow
if you want to see it so bad

JEFF
They dont rent R-rated pictures to
little kids and you know it

CONNIE (dreamily)
Shut up its Vanna I love Vanna

JEFF
Dennis-

DENNIS
Go ask Dad to tape it on the VCR in his
office and quit being such a totally
annoying little booger

JEFF crosses the room poking his tongue out at Vanna White as he
goes THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as he goes into the kitchen

KATIE
so when he asked me if Polly had
tested positive I had to remind him
shes away at prep school and God
Lois I miss her

JEFF is just passing through on his way to the stairs

KATIE
Will you kids please be quiet

JEFF (glum)
Theyll be quiet Now

He goes up the stairs a little dejected KATIE looks after him
loving and worried

KATIE
Theyre squabbling again Polly used
to keep them in line but now that
shes away at school I dont know
maybe sending her to Bolton wasnt
such a hot idea Sometimes when she
calls home she sounds so unhappy

INT BELA LUGOSI AS DRACULA CU

Dracs standing at the door of his Transylvanian castle Someone
has pasted a comic-balloon coming out of his mouth which reads
Listen My children of the night What music they make The
poster is on a door but we only see this as JEFF opens it and goes
into his fathers study

INT A PHOTOGRAPH OF KATIE CU

THE CAMERA HOLDS THEN PANS SLOWLY RIGHT We pass another photo
this one of POLLY the daughter away at school Shes a lovely
girl of sixteen or so Past POLLY is DENNIS then CONNIE then
JEFF

THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN AND ALSO WIDENS OUT so we can see BILL
WEIDERMAN a man of about forty-four He looks tired Hes peering
into the word-processor on his desk but his mental crystal ball
must be taking the night off because the screen is blank On the
walls we see framed book-covers All of them are spooky One of
the titles is Ghost Kiss

JEFF comes up quietly behind his dad The carpet muffles his feet
BILL sighs and shuts off the word-cruncher A moment later JEFF
claps his hands on his fathers shoulders

JEFF
BOOGA-BOOGA
BILL
Hi Jeffie

He turns in his chair to look at his son who is disappointed

JEFF
How come you didnt get scared

BILL
Scaring is my business Im case-hardened
Something wrong

JEFF
Daddy can I watch the first hour of
Ghost Kiss and you tape the rest
Dennis and Connie are hogging everything

BILL swivels to look at the book-jacket bemused

BILL
You sure you want to watch that champ
Its pretty-

JEFF
Yes
INT KATIE IN THE PHONE NOOK

In this shot we clearly see the stairs leading to her husbands
study behind her

KATIE
I really think Jeff needs the
orthodontic work but you know Bill-

The other line rings The other light stutters

KATIE
Thats just the other line Bill will-

But now we see BILL and JEFF coming downstairs behind her

BILL

KATIE

Shes rummaging frantically on her little phone desk Catalogues
go slithering to the floor around her stool

KATIE

BILL
So it was a prank Or someone who was

tears as we veteran hacks like to say

KATIE
It was not a prank and it was not a
wrong number It was someone in my family

the gun

KATIE (draws up beside him)

He points

INT THE LIVING ROOM WIDE BILL AND KATIES POV

The place looks like a cyclone hit it but it wasnt robbery or
murder that caused this mess only a healthy eighteen-month-old
baby After a strenuous day of trashing the living room Baby got
tired and Mommy got tired and they fell asleep on the couch
together The baby is in DAWNs lap There is a pair of Walkman
earphones on her head There are toys- tough plastic Sesame Street
and PlaySkool stuff for the most part- scattered hell to
breakfast The baby has also pulled most of the books out of the
bookcase Had a good munch on one of them too by the look BILL
goes over and picks it up It is Ghost Kiss

BILL
Ive had people say they just eat my
books up but this is ridiculous

Hes amused KATIE isnt She walks over to her sister ready to
be mad but she sees how really exhausted DAWN looks and
softens

Madonna and Child THE CAMERA PANS DOWN TO the Walkman We can
hear the faint strains of Huey Lewis and the News THE CAMERA PANS

She sighs bends down and replaces the phone Then she pushes the
STOP button on the Walkman

Shes radiant when she smiles

phone was off the hook I thought

with that music blasting

DAWN

Oh my God Bill Im sorry Justins

BILL
There are critics whod say he picked
just the right thing to teethe on I
dont want to scare you beautiful but
somebodys been at your front door lock
with a screwdriver or something
Whoever it was forced it

DAWN

Gosh no That was Jerry last week I
locked us out by mistake and he didnt
have his key and the spare wasnt over
the door like its supposed to be He
was mad because he had to take a whiz
real bad and so he took the screwdriver
to it It didnt work either- thats
one tough lock (Pause) By the time I
found my key hed already gone in the
bushes

BILL
If it wasnt forced how come I could
just open the door and walk in

DAWN (guiltily)
Well sometimes I forget to lock it

KATIE
You didnt call me tonight Dawn

DAWN
Gee no I didnt call anyone I was too
busy chasing Justin around He kept
wanting to eat the fabric softener Then
he got sleepy and I sat down here and
thought Id listen to some tunes while
I waited for your movie to come on Bill
and I fell asleep-
At the mention of the movie BILL starts visibly and looks at the
book Then he glances at his watch

look-alikes

KATIE
But you know your own At least I
thought so until tonight

She puts her cheek on his shoulder looking troubled
KATIE
I was so positive it was Polly

getting her feet under her at the new
school but judging from the stuff
she told you tonight Id say shes
doing just fine in that department

INT THE STUDY WITH KATIE NIGHT

The word-processor has been replaced by a wide lamp looming over a
stack of blueprints The book-jackets have been replaced by photos
of buildings Ones that have first been built in HANKs mind
presumably

KATIE is looking at the desk thoughtful and a little sad

HANK (voice)
Coming to bed Kate

She turns and THE CAMERA WIDENS OUT to give us HANK Hes wearing
a robe over pajamas She comes to him and gives him a little hug
smiling Maybe we notice a few streaks of gray in her hair her
pretty pony has done its fair share of running since BILL died

KATIE
In a little while A woman doesnt
see her first one get married every
day you know

HANK
I know

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they walk from the work area of the study to
the more informal area This is much the same as it was in the old
days with a coffee table stereo TV couch and BILLs old easy-
chair She looks at this

HANK
You still miss him dont you

KATIE
Some days more than others You didnt

the blank TV and THE CAMERA MOVES IN on her face One tear rims
one eye sparkling like a sapphire

lots Every day And you know what It
hurts

The tear falls She picks up the TV remote and pushes the ON
button

Star Time Movie Ghost Kiss

The logo DISSOLVES INTO a guy who looks like he died in a car
crash about two weeks ago and has since been subjected to a lot of
hot weather He comes staggering out of the same old crypt

INT KATIE

Terribly startled- almost horrified She hits the OFF button on
the remote control The TV blinks off
KATIEs face begins to work She struggles against the impending
emotional storm but the coincedence of the movie is just one
thing too many on what must have already been one of the most
emotionally trying days of her life The dam breaks and she begins
to sob terrible heartbroken sobs She reaches out for the
little table by the chair meaning to put the remote control on
it and knocks the phone onto the floor

Her tear-stained face grows suddenly still as she looks at the
telephone Something begins to fill in an idea an intuition
Hard to tell And maybe it doesnt matter

There is now a strange hypnotized look on her face She reaches
down scoops the telephone up and punches in numbers seemingly
at random

SOUNDS RINGING PHONE

KATIE continues to look hypnotized The look holds until the phone
is answered and she hears herself on the other end of the line

KATIE (voice filter)
Hello Weiderman residence

KATIE- our present-day KATIE with the streaks of gray in her hair-
goes on sobbing yet an expression of desperate hope is trying to
be born on her face On some level she understands that the depth
of her grief has allowed a kind of telephonic time-travel Shes
trying to talk to force the words out

KATIEs trembling finger carefully picks out the number and we
hear the corresponding tones 555-4408
INT KATIE IN BILLS OLD CHAIR CU
She closes her eyes as the PHONE BEGINS TO RING Her face is
filled with an agonizing mixture of hope and fear If only she can

have one more chance to pass the vital message on it says just
one more chance
KATIE (low)

RECORDED VOICE (filter)

KATIE hangs up again Tears stream down her cheeks THE CAMERA
PANS AWAY AND DOWN to the telephone
INT THE PHONE NOOK WITH KATIE AND BILL REPRISE

BILL

So it was a prank Or someone who was
crying so hard she dialed a wrong

number through a shimmering film
of tears as we veteran hacks like to
say

KATIE

It was not a prank and it was not a
wrong number It was someone in my
family

INT KATIE (PRESENT DAY) IN BILLS STUDY

KATIE
Yes Someone in my family Someone very
close (Pause) Me

She suddenly throws the phone across the room Then she begins to
SOB AGAIN and puts her hands over her face THE CAMERA HOLDS on
her for a moment then DOLLIES ACROSS TO

INT THE PHONE

It lies on the carpet looking both bland and somehow ominous
CAMERA MOVES IN TO ECU- the holes in the receiver once more look
like huge dark chasms We HOLD then

FADE TO BLACK
