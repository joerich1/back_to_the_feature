On black and white NEWSREEL FOOTAGE playing in a packed movie
theater

ON SCREEN we see a line of men and women weaving its way out
of an unemployment office and around the block

NARRATOR (VO)
As 1932 draws to a close the
United States finds itself mired in
the middle of a Great Depression

TIGHT ON a man holding a sign that reads “Will Work For
Food

NARRATOR (VO)
However there’s nothing depressing
about young love which seems to be
popping up everywhere this summer

We see the same man grab a passing woman and attempt to give
her a KISS She SLAPS him across the face

The man rubs his cheek smiles and SLAPS the woman back

He proceeds to PASSIONATELY KISS her until she SUCCUMBS to
his “charms”

NARRATOR (VO)
Also everywhere is United States
President Herbert Hoover

CUT TO

Hoover seated on the porch of the White House VIOLENTLY
SPANKS a child who is bent over his lap Seeing the camera
crew Hoover stops what he’s doing and waves happily

NARRATOR (VO)
When he’s not educating his
children through systematic kind-
hearted beatings he’s busy
campaigning for the upcoming
election and searching for ways to
help revitalize the economy Maybe
he could find some inspiration in
Hollywood

CUT TO
A MOVIE PREMIERE

Cameras flash as celebrities walk down the red carpet The
marquee reads “Tarzan The Ape Man”

NARRATOR (VO)
- where talking pictures are all
the rage And no star is shining
brighter than Johnny Weissmuller

As Weissmuller poses for photographs we ANGLE ON a handsome
tuxedo-clad man stepping out of a limousine This is JACK
BELL

NARRATOR (VO)
However as far as popularity goes
fiction writer and man about town
Jack Bell is Tinsel Town’s top
banana

Seeing Bell the group of photographers quickly abandon
Weissmuller and surround the limousine

NARRATOR (VO)
Son of vaudeville stars Tallulah
and Morgan Bell Jack found his
fame and fortune away from the
stage and on the page His Iron
Jack adventure novels loosely
based on his own globe-trotting
escapades are lifting the
country’s spirit and capturing its
imagination Speaking of
lifting

As adoring fans run up and hand Jack copies of his books to
sign we

CUT TO
A BASKETBALL COURT

NARRATOR (VO)

- Mort Goldberg has lifted the
Indianapolis Jets to their first
NBA championship with his
innovative new move called “the
layup”

We ANGLE ON a 510” basketball player (wearing a yarmulke)
awkwardly scooping the ball against the backboard and into
the basket The crowd goes wild

NARRATOR (VO)

- The crowd sure does love those
flashy moves Just look at the way
they’re showering that immigrant
family with produce

PANNING DOWN to the front of the bleachers we see an
immigrant family being PELTED with rotten produce

NARRATOR (VO)
And now a word from our sponsor

CUT TO
AN AIRFIELD —- DAY

A steely-eyed handsome man wearing a leather aviator helmet
and white scarf climbs out of the cockpit of a single prop
airplane Once again it’s author JACK BELL

Jack lights a cigarette and takes a deep drag Flashes a
warm smile at the camera

JACK
Whether its climbing snow-covered
mountains or crossing the seven
seas theres only one cigarette
that Jack Bell smokes Pall Mall

Jack takes another drag of his cigarette

JACK
Chock full of vitamins and minerals
Pall Mall only uses the freshest
and ripest tobacco out there Sure
9 out of 10 doctors will tell you
that Pall Malls are the healthiest
cigarettes on the market today but
if you want to know the truth its
the taste that keeps this thrill
seeker coming back for more Pall
Mall if youre looking for
adventure open up a pack

As Jack walks past a ten year-old boy he FLIPS the kid a
packet of cigarettes The boy smiles excitedly

BOY

If there’s one person I trust in

MEL
He seems like a heck of a guy A
real salt of the earth type I’m
sure he’s just like you and me

CUT TO

EXT MANSION - DAY

Sprawling grounds of manicured lawns and hedges Fancy new
cars stream into the driveway and pull up to the front door
INT JACK’S MANSION - NIGHT

A swinging party is taking place Sharply dressed revelers
are drinking champagne and eating caviar

The house is beautifully pointed with lots of oak and
leather The walls are adorned with framed Iron Jack book
covers and mounted animal heads many of which are now either
endangered or extinct

Two women MILDRED and BERNICE wearing glittery flapper
dresses sashay over to Jack who’s finishing up a cigarette
while simultaneously lighting another

BERNICE
This shin-dig is aces JB

MILDRED
The clam-bake of the year

JACK
Glad you could make it gals
Anything you need just ask my man-
servant Mum

Jack points to a short Peruvian man

MILDRED
Mum That’s a funny name

JACK

Actually I’m not sure what his
real name is He lost his tongue
in a Peruvian tribal war

(the women cringe)
I was down researching Iron Jack
And The Curse Of The Incan Gold
when I happened upon him half-dead
lying on the side of the road I
gave him a little food and water
and in no time he was as good as
new

MILDRED
And how did he end up here

JACK
According to jungle tribal custom
because I saved his life he became
indebted to me for all eternity
BERNICE
How droll I want to save a little
brown person and have them be my
house boy

JACK
Then you should head down to South
America They’re everywhere
Anyhoo before you leave don’t
forget to take one of my medical
journals

On the coffee table we see two stacks of journals

Butter And Red Meat Iron Jacks Tips To A Stronger Healthier

Heart
And

Contraception Is For Sinners - A Detailed Guide To Safer Sex
Using The Bell Technique AKA “The Pull Out”

MILDRED
I didn’t know you were a doctor

JACK
The surgeon general deputized me
last year

Jack proudly pulls a badge out of his breast pocket Sure
enough it’s inscribed with the words “Deputy Surgeon
General”

Just then Jack’s agent IRA GOLD a fast-talking frenetic
ball of positive reinforcement emerges from the study

He holds up a print add for Li’l Tykes Lead Based Nursery
Paint It’s an artist’s rendering of Jack painting a nursery
while smoking a cigarette

IRA
So what do you think Jack Do you
adore it Do you want to take it
to Lovers Lane and coerce it into
having premarital intercourse

JACK
I don’t know Ira it kind of makes
me look like a painter
IRA
That’s sort of the point Jack
You paint the walls with a lead-
based acrylic to keep the children
safe

JACK
I guess Although I think it might
be more convincing if I had a gun
I am an adventurer after all

IRA
Youre actually an writer

JACK
Who goes on adventures

IRA
You went to Acapulco last year

JACK
Researching my novel

IRA
(in a low whisper)
You stayed at a 4 star resort

JACK
Point being they need to make me
look less like a painter and more
like an writer who goes on
adventures

IRA
(slightly irritated)
Ill see what I can do

Suddenly the front door BURSTS open and POLICE
and a crew of uniformed officers barge into the house guns

drawn

CHIEF MORTON
Hands in the air You are all
under arrest for the consumption of
alcohol during a prohibition

CHIEF MORTON

The party grows SILENT There’s a BEAT And Jack and the
Chief burst out LAUGHING

JACK
Make yourself at home Chief
There’s heroin in the kitchen and
cocaine in the drawing room
As the Chief holsters his weapon

CHIEF MORTON
Thanks a million Jack You’re the
cat’s pajamas

PANNING OVER to the study we see a group of revelers
standing next to a large cage staring at an unseen animal
The group GIGGLES with glee as the “animal” thrashes about

Jack urgently rushes over

JACK
People if you could try not to
feed my brother Gerald He’s ona
strict diet of beef bones and
chicken gizzards

PANNING IN we now see that Gerald is actually a HUMAN BEING

WOMAN
What’s the matter with him

JACK
The medical term is “dyslexia”
It’s a form of retardation Lucky
for our parents it was diagnosed
early on and they were able to cage
Gerald at a young age Surprisingly
enough it was right around that
time that he began to acquire his
animalistic tendencies

MAN
Do you ever let him out

JACK
He escaped once Ate a whole
turkey

MAN

He caught and killed a turkey

JACK
No it was cooked But it ruined
Thanksgiving

Jack points toward the drawing room

JACK
If anyone’s feeling randy I just
received a new shipment of Dutch
stag films

(MORE)
JACK (contd)
And they are eggs and coffee I
tell you Eggs and coffee

As Jack ushers the group toward the door Gerald begins to
make unintelligible GRUNTING sounds

SUBTITLES READ “I’m not an animal I’m a human being”
CUT TO

LATER THAT NIGHT

The house is a mess The guests are half-conscious

BERNICE
(slurring)
This shin-dig is aces JB

MILDRED
(also slurring)
The clam-bake of the year

Jack nods and takes a sip of his martini Looking around the
room he realizes that there’s something rather depressing
about the whole situation

Chief Morton shoots a needle full of heroin into his arm and
falls over unconscious

JACK
Does anyone ever feel that there’s
more to life than great parties and
swinging good times

BERNICE
Like what Jack

JACK

Look at us we’re wearing the
sharpest clothes and drinking the
finest champagne and snorting the
zaniest go-go powder

CHIEF MORTON
Here here

JACK
But what are we actually achieving
Don’t you ever just want to grab
life by the horns and ride it like
an untrained gypsy

BERNICE
Not everyone can be as brave you
Jack
JACK
(evasively)
Right
Just then a large angry man STORMS into the room

ANGRY MAN
Where the hell’s my girlfriend

He’s met with blank stares and knowing SNICKERS

The man sneers at the assemblage and sprints up the stairs to
the second floor and begins to BANG on doors

Through the picture window we see a skinny naked Indian man
with a sheet wrapped around his waist DROPPING onto the lawn

As the naked Indian man begins to run across the yard

JACK
Run Ghandi run

Jack shakes his head and CHUCKLES
JACK

One of these days Mahatma’s gonna
slow down But until then lock up
the dames and hide the sauce Look
at the poor guy didn’t even have a
chance to grab his clothes

EXT STREET - A MINUTE LATER

Realizing he’s in the clear Ghandi slows down and catches
his breath He fastens the sheet into a toga

As he continues along he gazes down at his makeshift outfit
and nods in appreciation

EXT WHITE HOUSE - DAY
A line of homeless protestors line the front gates
INT OVAL OFFICE - SAME TIME

President HERBERT HOOVER looks out the window at the
assemblage and shakes his head in disgust

HOOVER
Jesus don’t these people have
jobs

Hoover’s Press Secretary JAMES MCKAY raises a curious
eyebrow

JAMES
Actually sir they don’t Which
is kind of why they’re protesting

TIGHT ON one of the protestors signs “Hoover Stuffs His Fat
Face While The People Starve”

HOOVER
Can you believe this These lazy
hooligans blame me for the state of
the economy

JAMES
You are the President sir

HOOVER
Be that as it may what do they
want from me

JAMES
They want hope sir

HOOVER
Hope And how exactly am I
supposed to give them that

PANNING DOWN to Hoovers desktop we see a newspaper article
declaring Iron Jack And The Curse Of Captain Kid’s Treasure
to be the top-selling novel of all time

HOOVER
Did you read the new Iron Jack
adventure I hear it’s something
else

JAMES
I did sir It was quite
entertaining

HOOVER
The people just love that Jack
Bell huh

JAMES
He’s a handsome fellow that’s for
sure

HOOVER
Yes he is But he also has that
special something

On the coffee table sits a book titled Legendary Lost
Treasures And Artifacts The cover has an artist rendering
of a large black diamond

Hoover walks over and stares hard at the book There’s a
BEAT A knowing smile curls across his lips

HOOVER
Out of curiosity do you think the
people are in love with Bell the
man or Iron Jack the character

JAMES
I think it’s a combination of the
two

HOOVER

Hypothetically if Bell went off to
try and find a real treasure do
you think the public would support
him

JAMES
I imagine they would

HOOVER
And do you think they’d believe
hed be successful

James pauses as he realizes what Hoover is getting at

JAMES (CONTD)
(suspiciously)
You’re not thinking what I think
youre thinking are you

HOOVER
If it’s hope the people want then I
see no reason to stand in their
way

JAMES
But that’s false hope sir These
treasures don’t actually exist

HOOVER
Maybe not but as long as we’re
raising the country’s morale we’re
providing a valuable service
(MORE )

HOOVER (contd)
If that service happens to benefit
us along the way then so be it I
mean look at the New York Yankees
they’ve won 8 World Championships
on the back of that half-Negro
Babe Ruth Are they breaking the
league’s rules Absolutely But
the fans couldn’t be happier

JAMES
It would give your re-election
campaign quite a boost

HOOVER
(sarcastically)
You don’t say

INT FITNESS ROOM - DAY

Jack and Ira smoke cigarettes while “vibrating strap
machines” jiggle their stomachs

JACK
What the hell does the president
want from me

IRA
Don’t know But it sounds
important

JACK
Maybe he wants to knight me

IRA
That’s usually a British thing

JACK

(lost in thought)
Sir Jack Bell It sounds so regal
Can you imagine the premarital sex
Id be having if I was a knight
Which isn’t to say that I’m not
swimming in mink already but if I
was a knight it would be a non-stop
whoopee-filled wing-ding

CUT TO
INT STEAM ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Jack and Ira still smoking cigarettes are now sitting ina
sauna wearing towels around their waists

IRA
I don’t think the president wants
to knight you Jack

JACK
Well let him know that if he
changes his mind I’m all for it

Ira decides to let it drop

IRA
Hey did you hear the one about the
Italian who went to college
(Jack shakes his head)
Neither have I

The two LAUGH uproariously

JACK
I got one Why do Italians smell
so bad
(Off Ira’s shrug)
So the blind can hate them too

More LAUGHTER and we
DISSOLVE TO
A SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS

A train whistle A conductor calling out “All Aboard” A
train engine chugging down the tracks A map of the country
and a dotted line indicating their travel progress all the
way to Washington DC

INT WHITE HOUSE - DAY
Jack and Ira stand before President Hoover and James McKay

HOOVER
First off Jack let me just say
that I am a big fan of your work
You are a true American hero

JACK
(humbly)
It’s what I do but not who I am

HOOVER
Jack I’m not gonna beat around the
bush I need your help

JACK
Whatever you want sir I’m here
for you
(to Ira)

He knows my fee right

Jack LAUGHS at his lame joke Hoover nods at James who hands
Jack the book of Legendary Treasures which is open to a
chapter on THE BLACK DIAMOND OF THE ORIENT

JAMES
Have you ever heard of the Black
Diamond Of The Orient

JACK
Sure It’s like the chink version
of the Holy Grail

JAMES
Legend has it that the diamond was
given to princess Xi Ling Chang by
Genghis Khan 1206 AD as a token of
his affection

FLASHBACK TO

A REENACTMENT

Black and white grainy silent film footage It’s apparent
the Chinese are actually Caucasian actors in makeup

-- Khan gives a tennis ball-sized black diamond to the
Princess and professes his love There’s a BEAT And the
Princess is joined by a handsome young man The two proceed
to LAUGH insultingly at the offering

JAMES (VO)
Unfortunately Princess Chang was
in love with another and the gift
was refused

-- Khan with tears in his eyes curses the diamond as
lightning FLASHES and thunder ROARS

JAMES (VO)
With his heart broken and ego
shattered Khan cursed the diamond
and swore vengeance on all of
humanity Of course we all know
what happened next

-- Khan and his forces rob and pillage with a reckless
albeit comical abandon

BACK TO -- PRESENT DAY

JAMES
As for the diamond it disappeared
shortly after Khan’s death Rumors
of its location surfaced over the
years but with no real proof

JACK
A black diamond Must be worth
thousands huh

HOOVER
Millions even Now what would you
say if I told you the government
has solid leads on the diamonds
whereabouts

JACK
Id say you tell me where it is and
I’ll split the profits 50-50

Hoover and James exchange a knowing look

HOOVER
What if we tell you where it is
you go retrieve it and we use the
sale of the stone to pull the
country out of its Depression

JACK
I like my idea better

Jack begins to LAUGH but quickly realizes that the President
isn’t joking

JACK
You’re serious

HOOVER
Were quite confident that the
information that’s been given to us
is the real deal You’d be doing
the country a valuable service

JACK
Why me

HOOVER
Because hunting treasure is what
Iron Jack does

Jack nods in understanding

JACK
And where exactly do you believe
the diamond is

JAMES
Africa Egypt to be exact

HOOVER
Look at it more as a paid vacation
You’1l be traveling first class all
the way And we’ll be sending
along a reporter to chronicle your
journey

JAMES
Just think of the press

HOOVER
Jack Bell Saves The Country

JAMES
You’1l1 be a national hero

JACK
I thought I already was

HOOVER
A legend even

Jack looks to Ira who shrugs It honestly sounds like a
pretty good gig

IRA
And when would he be leaving
JAMES
As soon as possible
HOOVER
(imploringly )

What do you say Jack The country
needs you

IRA
It could help with sales

Theres a BEAT as Jack considers the request He looks down
at the artist rendering of the diamond Looks to Hoover
To James To Ira Back to the artist rendering

JACK
I appreciate the offer Mr
President I really do but
unfortunately I’m quite busy right
now I’ve just been hired to teach
a course on Wild Western Adventure
Writing And The Role Of The Injun
at UCLA Plus I’ve decided to take
up tennis But good luck

CUT TO

EXT WHITE HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

As Jack Ira and Mum get into a limousine we PAN UP to the
window of the Oval Office

INT OVAL OFFICE - SAME TIME
Hoover watches as the limousine drives off

JAMES
It was a good idea Nix that it
was a great idea

HOOVER
Exactly Which is why that smug
son of a bitch is going whether he
wants to or not

INT UCLA OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

As Jack approaches to door to his office he notices a
handyman removing his nameplate from the door

The door opens and out walks the DEAN wearing a monocle and
smoking a pipe Seeing Jack he flashes a nervous smile

DEAN
Jack What are you doing here

JACK
Isn’t today the first day of class

DEAN
(anxiously)
You didn’t receive my telegraph

Just then a handsome bearded young man in his early-30s
emerges from the office It’s Ernest Hemingway

ERNEST
Are you sure I can’t share this
office with someone else It seems
awfully big for just one person

DEAN
Jack this is Ernest Hemingway He
just arrived in town from Key West
Florida

Ernest smiles excitedly and extends his hand

ERNEST
Jack Bell Wow Big fan Huge
Can I just tell you that if it
wasn’t for you and the Iron Jack
Adventures I wouldn’t be here
today Big inspiration Huge

Jack shrugs coolly

JACK
Glad to be of service guy But
the real question is what are you
doing in my office

As we PAN OVER to the handyman replacing Jack’s nameplate
with Hemingway’s the answer is obvious

INT JACK’S MANSION - DAY

Ira looks on as Jack paces back and forth venting his
frustration

JACK
I was born to teach this class
I’ve graphically described the
killing of over 600 Indians in my
novels Not to mention my limo
driver ran over a drunken Navajo
last year in Santa Barbara

IRA
Youre preaching to the choir
Jack But there’s nothing we can
do now

JACK
You just watch this Hemingway
guy’s a tomato can He’1ll tarnish
the good name of fiction writers
everywhere

Just then the doorbell RINGS

JACK
Who the hell could that be

Jack goes over and opens the door revealing four men in grey
suits carrying briefcases One of the men DEWEY TIMLIN
holds up an ID card

TIMLIN
Dewey Timlin IRS May we come in

CUT TO
INT JACK’S STUDY - AN HOUR LATER

Stacks of files and receipts are now scattered across the
floor The IRS agents are packing up their belongings

JACK
I hate to make you repeat yourself
guy but I still don’t understand
what the problem is

TIMLIN
The problem Mr Bell is that you
haven’t paid your income tax in the
last five years

JACK
(unfazed)
And
TIMLIN
And that’s a felony
JACK
And
TIMLIN

And all US citizens are required by

law to pay income tax It’s

actually very straight forward

JACK
(blankly)

But I’m a celebrity

Off of Timlin’s exasperated look we
CUT TO

EXT JACK’S DRIVEWAY- TEN MINUTES LATER

As the IRS agents drive off Jack shouts after them

JACK
This country was built on
inequality and by forcing me to
pay income tax you are mocking the
hopes and dreams of our founding
fathers Mocking them I tell you
Mocking them

INT DEN - DAY
Jack sits on the couch reading dog-eared copy of Iron Jack

And The Curse Of The Incan Gold a pitcher of martinis in
front of him He’s clearly drunk And depressed

As his eyes start to close we

A DREAM SEQUENCE

Iron Jack (played by Jack) is surrounded by a group of
Mexican banditos Each of the banditos holds a gun in one
hand and a tequila bottle in the other The leader of the
gang PABLO steps forward

PABLO
It looks like the end of the road
for you Senor Iron Yack

JACK
I hate to burst your bubble Pablo
but if you think you and your
Drunken Pachuco Boys are going to
stop me from returning Cleopatras
Ruby to the National Museum you’ve
got another thing coming

As one of the banditos reaches for his gun Jack pulls out
his sword lighting quick and flicks the pistol out of the
man’s hand

JACK
Well call that a warning

PANNING ACROSS the henchmen’s faces we see them exchanging
anxious and menacing looks You can feel the tension

Just then we hear a horse NAY Jack DRAWS his gun and
proceeds to SHOOT each of the Mexican men in the heart
killing them instantly

Jack holsters his weapon and surveys his handwork He
solemnly picks up a bottle of tequila and pours it onto
Pablo’s corpse

JACK
Adios amigo

As a dog begins to BARK off in the distance

JACK awakes only to find himself back in his house the open
book on his lap

her mid-50s who’s getting into costume In the BG we see a
man being fitted for an anatomically correct horse costume

TALLULAH
- SO you’re going on a vacation
to Africa

JACK
It’s not a vacation mother It’s
a treasure hunt

TALLULAH
Your father once performed Macbeth
for a group of Negro school
children in Harlem They were very
well behaved

JACK
So you think I should go

TALLULAH (CONTD)
If it wasn’t for the color of their
skin you would’ve thought they
were Caucasian Or at least Greek

JACK
I’m serious mother

TALLULAH
As am I This could be good for
you You’ve spent your entire life
writing about adventures it’s high
time you went on one yourself

JACK
So that’s a yes

TALLULAH

Consensual Sex In The Workplace Is It Fair To Women”

Frank forces an uncomfortable smile

FRANK
(lacking conviction)
Don’t be ridiculous I I loved
that piece

NORMA
(obstinately)
What if I told you I think the Iron
Jack books are mindless drivel
They’re chauvinistic misogynistic
and racist There’s not an ounce of
intellectual substance to them

FRANK
Id say you’re entitled to your
opinion but the rest of the
country disagrees with you

Norma SIGHS exasperated It’s a fight she’s going to lose

NORMA
Fine You win I’11 go but I
won’t enjoy myself And I can’t
promise you that what I write will
be flattering

Frank smiles appreciatively

FRANK
That’a girl

Now how about you come over here

drive

Norma frowns at the thought but doesn’t respond

EXT ROME ITALY - DAY
Establishing on Mussolini’s castle headquarters
INT CASTLE WAR ROOM - SAME TIME

Mussolini stands before a table of military advisors He
holds up a copy of The Times with Jack on the cover

He SLAMS the paper against the table

MUSSOLINI
The gluttonous Americans think they
own the globe and all of its
riches But the time has come to
show the world that Mother Italy is
also entitled to her piece of the
prosperity pie

ADVISOR
But how

Mussolini shoots the advisor an icy stare

MUSSOLINI
Did you just ask how

The advisor nods sheepishly

MUSSOLINI
By beating this Jack Bell to the
diamond we will show the world
that the land of pasta and chianti
is also a land of great
determination and strength

Mussolini pulls out a gun and SHOOTS the advisor in the
forehead killing him instantly

MUSSOLINI
Any other questions

One of the more decorated officers GENERAL GIUSEPPE LOPRIMO
stands and salutes Mussolini

GIUSEPPE
Do not worry Il Duce I will find
the gem for mother Italy and allow
her to become the super power she
was always destined to be

INT CRUISE SHIP - DAY

Jack boards the vessel as Mum trails behind him carrying his
17 bags of luggage

JACK

If you could take the bags up
to my cabin and run a hot bath Id
be in your debt forever Not like
you are to me but I would
definitely appreciate it Also
see if you can track down a little
morphine I have the worst
headache

Toby Roland walks over and extends his hand

TOBY
Jack Bell Toby Roland Bureau Of

for the mission

The two shake

JACK
Pleasure to meet you Toby
Although I’m not sure I actually
need a guide If you’ve ever read
any of my novels you’d know that I
have a nose for treasure

Jack points to his nose and LAUGHS

JACK (CONTD)
Get it Like a Jewish person

NORMA (0S)
I told you I can carry my own
goddamn bag thank you very much

PANNING OVER we see Norma pulling her suitcase out of the
hands of an embarrassed attendant

Jack smiles knowingly

JACK
Feisty
(to Toby)
You know what that means in bed
right It means she would be
feisty Which is a good thing A
very good thing

Jack walks over to Norma and smiles brightly

JACK
Ma’am I would just like to commend
you on your independent spirit I
think it’s a brave choice youre
making to carry your own bags And
I applaud you for it

Norma studies Jack curiously surprised by the sincerity of
the comment

NORMA
Thank you Mr

JACK
Bell Jack Bell

NORMA
Yes I know

JACK
Well then you should also know that
even though I’m a world famous
wordsmith I believe all people
whether they be man woman or
Irish have the right to carry
their own luggage

Norma nods appreciatively
NORMA

As a woman I appreciate your
support Mr Bell

Norma extends her hand and smiles

NORMA
Norma Madsen I’m with The Times
I’ve been assigned to cover your
expedition

Jack shakes his head bemused

JACK

A female newspaper reporter Well
I guess I have seen it all

Just kidding But not really
Seriously though if you want to
learn more about my career or my
personal thoughts on the human
filth we call the Irish I’d love

DISSOLVE TO
A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS
Of Jack droning on about his life as Norma jots down notes
-- AT A BLACK TIE DINNER

JACK
- The thing that separates me
from other celebrities is my humble
nature I don’t write novels for
the publicity or the money I do it
for the people

-- TANNING BY THE SWIMMING POOL

JACK (CONTD)
-- I guess you could say I’ma
people person Which is why I love
to travel I truly do enjoy
learning about different cultures
Take the French for example I
don’t know a lot about them
outside of the fact they eat feces
and have sexual relations with
stray dogs

-- GETTING A SHAVE AT THE BARBER SHOP

JACK (CONTD)
But I don’t hold that against
them I’11 still let them shine my
shoes or mow my lawn any day of the
week Because when it comes down
to it they’re just like you and I
albeit with worse breath and
jittery house pets

-- PLAYING SHUFFLE BOARD ON THE LIDO DECK

JACK
The point is I’m open to new
things It’s like when talkies
first came out and everyone was up
in arms saying “Who wants to hear
actors talk when you can read
dialogue and watch emotive facial
expressions” But as it turned
out people don’t go to the movies
to read they go so they don’t have
to

Just then a small gypsy woman comes running down the walkway
being chased by one of the ship’s officers

OFFICER
Stowaway Stowaway

As the woman runs past Jack he holds out his arm and CLOTHES-
LINES her KNOCKING her head-over-heels

As the woman tries to stand Jack PUNCHES her in the face
knocking her out cold

JACK (CONTD)
(to Norma)
If you want to call me a hero
that’s your prerogative But just
remember I’m an American first and
foremost

As Jack is surrounded by well-wishers we

DISSOLVE TO
A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS

accompanied by action photos of Jack on the cruise ship

It’s obvious Frank is not happy with the product

-- After a few small tweaks the article is released now
titled “Jack Bell Worlds Greatest Writer Or Hero”

INT WHITE HOUSE - DAY

James holds up the article which coincides with the new
polls showing Hoover to be pulling ahead of FDR

EXT CASABLANCA DOCKS - DAY
Jack and the group exit the ocean liner

JACK
So in summation for me 1928
will always be the year of
penicillin Or as I like to call
it “Clap-Away”

Jack pauses and gazes around at the port in awe

JACK
Casablanca What a magnificent
city So full of life and energy

(It should be noted every location from here on out should
be filmed on a sound stage The movie should feel and look
like it was shot in 1932 In Hollywood)

NORMA
Out of curiosity Jack are you
concerned at all about the curse
that surrounds the Black Diamond

JACK
Curse
NORMA
It’s rumored that every man who has
ever searched for the stone has met
an untimely demise and brought
tragedy and misfortune to those
around him

JACK
That is ridiculous

we reconvene here in an hour

JACK
Sure thing Ace In the mean time
I think I might take a little
stroll to stretch the old stems

Care to join me

Just then Jack BUMPS into a young Arab child who’s wearing a
head-wrap and eating an ice cream cone
the ground and the child turns and glares at Jack

The cone DROPS to
Jack smiles innocently and points to a passing HASIDIC MAN to
deflect the blame

We see a tour guide motioning to the boy’s mother

The boy’s mother takes his hand and begins to drag him away

Jack walks along with Norma and Mum

JACK
At the end of the day it was a
silly accident I apologized to
his widow and we all moved on
Well not Harry But Wilhelmina
and I did have a bit of a fling for
a few weeks

NORMA
(sarcastically)
That’s a charming story Jack You
should be proud

JACK
I am

Norma rolls her eyes She glances down at her watch

NORMA
We should probably be getting back
to the hotel

JACK
Feel free to run along sweet-
cheeks but Mum and I need to take
a load off and the concierge told
me just the place

CUT TO
INT OPIUM DEN - DAY

Filled with catatonic smokers Jack sits on a couch puffing
on a large hookah filled with opium Mum and Norma sit
across from him anxious and bored

JACK
If I’ve said it once I’ve said ita
thousand times there is nothing
that relaxes a man more than a
pipeful of Aunti Emma

NORMA
You do know that there are those
out there who feel that opium might
not be as healthy for you as most
doctors would have you believe

JACK
Thanks for the warning bright
eyes but I think I’1l stick to
medical science when it comes to my
narcotic use

Jack takes a big puff of the pipe and leans back in his seat
His eyes glaze over

JACK
That’s the stuff

Jack brings his hand up to his face and proceeds to wave it
back and forth He begins to GIGGLE Slowly his CHUCKLES
build into UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER

JACK
This might just be the funniest
thing I have ever seen And that
includes the time I saw the Burping
Macgillicuddy Sisters at the
Arclight

FLASHBACK TO
THE MCGILLIGUTTY SISTERS ACT

Two overweight woman wearing red and white checkered dresses

BURP to “Sweet Georgia Brown” The audience is in hysterics
BACK TO -- THE OPIUM DEN
JACK

I wonder if the Black Diamond Of
The Orient tastes like chocolate

From a nearby couch an elderly Egyptian man wearing a white
linen suit and fedora MORENO calls out

MORENO
Did you just mention the Black
Diamond of The Orient

JACK
Youve heard of it

Moreno studies Jack a faint recognition registering in his
eyes

MORENO
Do I know you You look familiar
JACK
I have that kind of face
MORENO
A familiar face or a face that I
know
JACK

It’s possible both
A waiter comes over and Jack holds up three fingers
JACK
Give me three fingers of corn and a

tin roof back

MORENO
Tin roof

JACK
Another name for water friend
Because it’s on the house

Jack extends his hand

JACK
The name’s Bell Jack Bell

MORENO
Like the American author

JACK
Take out the like and you’re on the
money Sonny

Realizing Jack’s identity Moreno nods in acknowledgement

MORENO
Are you a gambling man Mr Bell

JACK
Depends on what’s at stake

MORENO
How about inside information on the
black diamond’s whereabouts

Moreno smiles mischievously

INT RESTAURANT - SAME TIME
Toby sits with a short Arab man AGENT LILLEY

LILLEY
(in a British accent)
Do you want me to use a local
accent to make it sound more
authentic

TOBY
I don’t think it matters The man
is a world class idiot

Lilley nods There’s a BEAT

LILLEY
The President’s going all out on
this one huh

TOBY
You don’t know the half of it
Were talking 8 cities and 27

INT BASEMENT - NIGHT

Dimly lit and filled with sweaty men exchanging handfuls of

cash

Jack raises a curious eyebrow

JACK

So what’s the name of the game
MORENO

Roulette
JACK

I don’t see a wheel

MORENO
It’s the Russian kind

In the center of the room is a table and two chairs

Jack now notices a gun sitting in the middle of the table

JACK
And whos playing

Moreno’s gaze turns to Mum He smiles sadistically

MORENO
Man servants Mine against yours

JACK
And if I win you’ll give me all
the information you have on the
whereabouts of the Black Diamond

Moreno nods Jack looks to Mum and winks confidently
stares back blankly unsure of what’s being negotiated

MORENO
And if I win I get your watch
I’ve been admiring it all evening

Norma walks up and grabs Jack’s arm aghast

NORMA
This is absurd You cant risk
Mum’s life over this

Jack calmly leads Norma away from Moreno He whispers

JACK
Relax toots I wrote a similar
scene in Iron Jack And The Search
For Captain Kids Treasure And at
the end of the day Jack ended up
with both the girl and the ghost
pirate gold

NORMA
(incredulous )
Youre insane

JACK
Like a fox

NORMA
That doesnt make any sense

JACK
All Im saying is theres a fine
line between genius and insanity
and its one I walk every day

Mum

As we TRACK around the faces of the crowd we HOLD ON a
familiar one -- General Giuseppe LoPrimo The general
watches Jack intently studying his every move

Jack puts his arm around Mum’s shoulder and leads him over to
the table

JACK
Alright pal let’s give these
people a show

Mum stares at Jack with a look of utter confusion Staring
down at the gun we see his eyes go wide with terror He now
gets it

Moreno walks up to the table and places a bullet into the
chamber of the pistol Gives the cylinder a SPIN He gazes
around the room and calls out

MORENO
One bullet One shot One kill

The crowd SCREAMS with delight Moreno lays the gun in front
of Mum Jack walks over and picks up the pistol

JACK
You don’t mind if I inspect the
weapon first do you

Before Moreno can answer BAM The weapon DISCHARGES
shooting Moreno’s servant in the forehead killing him
instantly

JACK
(sheepishly)
My bad So what does that count
as A foul

MORENO
Not to worry Accidents happen
Luckily I have more than one man
servant

Moreno SNAPS his fingers and another servant obediently runs
over and takes the place of his fallen comrade

Moreno again chambers a single bullet and gives the cylinder
a demonstrative SPIN He hands the gun to Jack

MORENO
For your inspection

JACK
That’s alright I trust

BAM Again the weapon DISCHARGES Shooting Moreno’s new man-
servant in the forehead killing him instantly

JACK
Seriously not my fault It’s got
a bit of a hair-trigger
MORENO
(irritated)
Let’s try this one more time

Moreno SNAPS his fingers and another one of his servants runs
up to the table

Again Moreno chambers a single bullet and gives the cylinder
a SPIN This time he places the gun directly into Mums
hand Mum nervously raises the gun to his temple

Jack smiles confidently apparently unaware of the danger
involved and gives him the thumbs-up

Mum grits his teeth and pulls the trigger CLICK
The crowd GROANS their displeasure
Moreno’s man-servant is up next He raises the pistol to his
own temple His eyes bulging with terror BAM The pistol
goes off killing the poor man instantly
JACK
(excitedly)
That’s what I’m talking about

As Moreno’s man-servant slumps over the table a burgundy
pool of blood forms around his head

Mum breaths a deep SIGH of relief and we
CUT TO
EXT MORENO’S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Establishing on a huge Moroccan mansion Armed guards patrol
the entrance

INT COMPOUND - SAME TIME

A small cocktail party is taking place The crowd is an
eccentric group of international types

We ANGLE ON Jack Norma and Mum standing with a distinguished
looking man in a stylish safari outfit

JACK
- Between you me and the two
walls I don’t like the blacks If
it were up to me I’d keep them
separate from all the others

PANNING DOWN we now see that Jack is actually referring to
BLACK JELLY BEANS which he’s removing from a candy dish

Moreno calls out from across the room

MORENO
Right this way Mr Bell

Jack gives the man in the safari outfit a pat on the back

JACK
Take care pal And have a safe
trip back to South Africa

Jack Norma and Mum follow Moreno into
THE STUDY - CONTINUOUS

JACK
I like your friend What does he
do again

MORENO
He’s an advisor to the South
African Prime Minister Very
influential

PANNING around the room we now see that (like Jack’s house)
it is decorated with mounted animal heads

MORENO
Personally I find nothing more
exhilarating than putting a bullet
into the brain of a wild beast

And we ANGLE ON a mounted HUMAN HEAD
NORMA
It’s a shame they couldn’t do the

same to you

MORENO
Feisty

JACK
That’s exactly what I said

NORMA
So tell me Mr Moreno is it true
that the diamond is cursed

JACK
Don’t be ridiculous

MORENO
Actually the young woman is
correct Death and despair are
believed to follow those who follow
the diamond

JACK
Well let’s hope that trend doesn’t
continue Am I right High five

Jack holds up his hand Moreno studies him confused

JACK
It’s a new term I made up As a
congratulatory gesture I slap hands
with my friends Five being the
number of fingers that touch It’s
quicker than a handshake and seems
more manly as well

Moreno nods He gently PRESSES his hand against Jack’s
which comes across as being EXTREMELY GAY

JACK
Well work on it So the diamond
what do you know A bet’s a bet

Moreno withdraws a tattered and weathered map out of a desk
drawer He hands it to Jack

JACK
Looks old
(sniffs it)
Smells old Musty

MORENO
It was found in the anal cavity of
a diamond smuggler

Jack GAGS at the thought and drops the map to the desk

MORENO (CONTD)
as he was being prepared for
roasting You see human flesh is
considered a delicacy among many of
the local tribes
(MORE )

MORENO (CONT’D)
What’s remarkable about this map is
that the man who was in possession
of it was once missing a foot
However when he was captured both
were there He claims that the
diamond has magical healing powers

JACK
(sarcastically)
I thought all who came into contact
with the diamond met a tragic end

MORENO
Youre forgetting that he was
eventually eaten by a tribe of
savages

JACK
Right Well as long as you believe
him that’s good enough for me Up
high

Jack holds up his hand for another high-five Moreno again
presses his hand against Jack’s in a gentle and EXTREMELY GAY
manner

JACK (CONTD)
We definitely need to work on that

We slowly PAN IN on the map revealing a river labeled NILE
leading to a waterfall labeled BLUE NILE FALLS in Ethiopia

In front of the falls is a rainbow At the base of the
rainbow is an indecipherable character which would appear to
be the home of the treasure

Hoover stops to pose next to a man with a huge tumor growing
out of the side of his throat Smoke from Hoover’s cigarette
causes the man to COUGH violently

can see Its a nature lovers
paradise if there ever was one

Norma shakes her head disapprovingly

NORMA
I got news for you Mr Bell youre
living in the past This is 1932
We dont club seals for fun
anymore We club them for dog
food

Jack LAUGHS defensively

JACK
Living in the past For your
information sweet-cheeks Im
probably the most forward thinking
man youve ever met

NORMA
Oh really

JACK
Really I believe that Chinaman
make the best launderers and that
women should be treated as equals
in the secretarial work force Im
the one who made calling Negroes
“Dark Continent Americans”
fashionable And I have never
clubbed a baby seal that didnt
deserve clubbin’ in my entire life

There’s a BEAT as Jack catches his breath
JACK
Wow That was exhilarating You

feeling it

NORMA

should uh you know

Jack raises his eyebrows suggestively

NORMA
Good night Mr Bell

JACK
You sure It could be an earth
shattering experience History
would indicate that there’s a 28
chance I’m just sayin’

No response

JACK (CONTD)
If it’s your reputation you’re
worried about I’1ll have you know
that I am very discreet when it
comes to matters of the heart For
example I have never told anyone
that Bette Davis has a superfluous
nipple Or that Amelia Earhart
likes to rub her genitals against
the back of a couch before
consummation

Just then a dark handsome man who has been watching the two
from the end of the bar steps forward It’s General Giuseppe

LoPrimo Giuseppe steps between Jack and Norma

GIUSEPPE
Signore can’t you see that the
young lady wishes to be left alone

JACK
Are you talking to me

GIUSEPPE
I am merely pointing out that as a
gentleman you should respect a
woman’s wishes

JACK
And as an Italian which I’m
guessing you are by your swarthy
complexion and autistic-sounding
accent you should be aware that
your odor is rather off-putting

GIUSEPPE
You are the writer Jack Bell are
you not

JACK

That’s right You a fan

GIUSEPPE
In my country heroes don’t write
about courage and bravery they
possess it

JACK
(obtusely)
Is that a yes

Theres a BEAT and Jack finally gets the hint

JACK
Whatever
(to Norma)
I will see you in the morning And
if you have a change of heart my
offer still stands

Jack sneers at Giuseppe and exits the car Giuseppe
approaches Norma and smiles warmly

GIUSEPPE
Excuse me bellisima is this seat
taken

Norma shakes her head mesmerized by the Giuseppe’s dashing
good looks

GIUSEPPE
I hope I did not offend your
boyfriend

NORMA
(quickly)
Oh he’s not my boyfriend

words

Norma blushes flattered

Mum shakes his head

I have to be honest this is an
awkward position to be in It’s
like my hand has been left hanging
in the air with no other hand to

PANNING OVER we see a short well-dressed man intently

Jack casts a nervous glance around the surface of the water

JACK
(anxiously)
What kind of creatures

CAPTAIN
Aqua Ticks Microscopic parasites

JACK
(relieved)
Oh You scared me for a second

CAPTAIN
You should be fine as long as you
dont urinate

Jack nervously looks down into the water a look of concern
and guilt painted across his face

JACK
Why can’t I urinate

Because they’1l swim into the
stream and lodge themselves in

Jacks eyes go wide with FEAR

JACK

Holy crap There’s a parasite
laying eggs inside of my penis

Jack quickly swims back to the boat and climbs on board He
begins to roll about on the deck violently rubbing and
scratching his crotch

JACK
Get it out of me Get it out of my
penis Now

CAPTAIN
It’s not that easy

JACK
What do you mean Ow It stings
It stings so bad inside of my
penis

CAPTAIN
The only way to dislodge it is to
put the opening into something even
warmer than their nest

JACK
Like what

CAPTAIN
A flame

JACK
You want me to put my penis into
fire

CAPTAIN
(gravely)
It’s your only option

JACK
(horrified)
Don’t say that Please tell me
youre joking

The captain begins to LAUGH

CAPTAIN
I’m just joking

JACK
(suspiciously)
You are Or are you just saying
that because I told you to and I
still have to put my penis into a

fire

CAPTAIN
No A cup of warm milk should
suffice

JACK

A cup of warm milk
The captain nods Jack studies the captain suspiciously

JACK
Youre not winding me up are you
I mean just so you can say you got
Jack Bell to put is his penis into
a warm cup of milk

CAPTAIN
(confused)
And why would I want to do that

JACK

Hey I don’t know why people do the
things they do but I do know that
there are quite a few people who
would get a kick out of hearing
that Iron Jack Bell was tricked
into putting his penis into a warm
cup of milk Quite a few

Suddenly Jack HOWLS in agony
JACK

Jesus Christ Give me some goddamn
milk

EXT RIVER BOAT - NIGHT

The crew sits on deck eating dinner Jack chats with the
German politician who we still never see directly
JACK
As I was saying Dolph in
politics these days you have to
shake things up a bit Push the
envelope If you never expand your

horizons youll always have the
same sunsets

Norma trying to keep a straight face calls out

NORMA
Jack can you please pass the milk

We hear a few muted CHUCKLES Jack looks up irritated

JACK
And what’s that supposed to mean

NORMA
That I want some milk and I need
you to pass it to me
More stifled LAUGHTER Jack glares at the crew
TOBY
That reminds me I had an uncle who
once owned a dairy farm
More SNICKERS
CAPTAIN
Good for bones That’s what they
say
As the table breaks into a fit of hysterical LAUGHTER we
DISSOLVE TO
A MONTAGE
Of their journey down the Nile

-- Jack fishes off the back of the boat and reels in a HUGE
PYTHON that causes complete and utter chaos on board

-- Jack pours himself a glass of milk and the crew breaks
into a fit of hysterical LAUGHTER

-- Jack goes for a swim and emerges from the water covered in
leeches

-- Jack pours himself another glass of milk and again the
crew breaks into a fit of hysterical LAUGHTER

EXT RIVERBED -— DAY

Jack and Norma gather fruit and vegetables along the side of
the river

JACK
Id like to apologize for the way
some of the crew has been acting
They’re not accustomed to being
around celebrities and it shows

Norma rolls her eyes

JACK (CONTD)
The only reason I mention it is I
feel we might’ve gotten off on the
wrong foot You’ve seen me at my
worst and for that I’d like to

apologize
NORMA
There’s no need
JACK
Yes there is I can be an idiot
sometimes I know that And I
regret if I’ve done anything to
offend you
NORMA
I appreciate your concern but I’m
a big girl
JACK
Not big enough if you ask me
NORMA
What
JACK
Nothing

Suddenly Jack stops in his tracks

JACKS POV Sitting in front of them is a giant silver-back
gorilla chewing on fallen branches

Jack puts his finger to his lips

JACK
Shhhh

The gorilla GROWLS menacingly

NORMA
(whispering)
What should we do

Jack studies the gorilla intently After a moment a knowing
grin spreads across his lips

JACK
(confidently )
Not to worry toots My mother was
once involved in a similar
situation in “Broadway Betty And
The Wacky Gorilla”

FLASHBACK TO

A SCENE FROM THE MOVIE

Jacks mother Tallulah and a man in a gorilla suit perform
a charming little tap dance number complete with high kicks
and jazz hands

TALLULAH

(singing)
Everybody loves to tap
White Irish Chink or Black
They all love that tap-tap-tap
Tall-short-thin-or fat-fat-fat
Broadway Betty and her dancing feet
Can even tame a jungle beast

BACK TO -- PRESENT DAY

Jack slowly walks up to the animal and STARTS TO TAP
DANCE The gorilla looks at Jack confused

NORMA
(nervously)
What are you doing

JACK
Tap dancing

Jack continues his soft-shoe routine
NORMA

I’m not sure that’s such a good
idea

JACK
Have you even seen a talking
picture in the last two years Tap
dancing is the answer to all of
life’s problems

As Jack continues to dance a pleasant smile spreads across
the gorilla’s face He couldn’t look more harmless

NORMA
(surprised)
I think it’s working

JACK
Of course it’s working
(begins to sing)
Everybody loves to tap
White Irish

Suddenly the gorilla pounces on Jack

SLAMS JACK TO THE GROUND LIKE A RAG DOLL PUNCHES JACK IN
THE BACK OF THE HEAD JUMPS ON HIS SPINE SMASHES JACK’S
HEAD AGAINST A ROCK

JACK
AH HELP ME THE BEAST IS
CRUSHING MY SKULL I CAN FEEL THE
CRANIAL PLATES SPLINTERING AND THE
SPLINTERS GOING INTO MY BRAIN

NORMA
Just relax

JACK
HOW CAN I RELAX THIS IS THE WORST
PAIN ANY HUMAN COULD EVER
EXPERIENCE WHY IS THIS HAPPENING
I WAS ONLY TAP DANCING I WAS
ONLY TAP DANCING

As the gorilla begins to WAIL on Jack’s face we

CUT TO

EXT STEAMBOAT DECK - DAY

Jack ices down his bruises while the crew looks on once
again amused by his misfortune

JACK
(annoyed)
If you think this is funny then
you all have some real growing up
to do

Just then we hear the sound of another STEAM ENGINE off in
the distance

Toby pulls out a pair of binoculars
TOBY’S POV A steamboat can be seen approaching at a high
rate of speed On the deck stands General LoPrimo and his

Italian henchmen guns raised

Toby lowers the binoculars confused

TOBY
I don’t believe it
NORMA
What
TOBY
It’s General Giuseppe LoPrimo
JACK
Who
TOBY

Mussolini’s right-hand man What
the hell could he be doing here

Norma flashes a guilty smile and shrugs obliviously

TOBY
Unless

JACK
What

TOBY

Unless they too are after the
stone But that’s ridiculous

As the Italian’s boat draws closer Jack now sees that
LoPrimo is the man who insulted him on the train

JACK
(sotto)
So we meet again

As Toby and the captain load their guns Jack nods his
approval

JACK
I like the way you guys think
Scare ‘em with roscoes and send ‘em
packin’ before things get hairy

As the boat draws closer Jack yells out

JACK
If you dirty wops don’t hightail it
out of here we’re gonna fill you
full of daylight and send you home
in a Chicago overcoat

Jack WINKS at Toby just as a GUNSHOT rings out SHATTERING the
wheelhouse window behind Jack’s head

JACK
Jesus H Christ Those little
pizza tossers just shot at us

Another shot DISINTEGRATES the lantern above the wheelhouse
door

Toby and the captain FIRE back The situation quickly
devolves into an all out FIRE FIGHT

Toby is HIT in the shoulder and FLIPS over the side of the
boat

Norma quickly grabs a rescue line and throws it to him
The captain is also HIT He drops to the ground dead

As the Italian boat closes in Jack picks up the captain’s
pistol and takes aim

NORMA
Forget them Get the wheel

JACK
I’m on it

As Jack starts for the wheel he accidentally trips and
falls dropping the gun to the deck BAM The pistol
discharges and the bullet SEVERS Toby’s rescue line

JACK
(sheepishly)
Whoops

Toby is now on his own floating down the river

The formerly unseen German politicianbirdwatcher emerges
from the steamboat’s cabin We now see that it’s none other
than ADOLPH HITLER

HITLER
Vat is happening

Just then the boat RAMS a submerged log and Hitler is THROWN
overboard

As the current sucks him below the surface Jack grabs a life
preserver and tosses it to the drowning man

It’s a PERFECT THROW and lands directly in Hitler’s hand

There’s a BEAT And Hitler resurfaces HIS LIFE SAVED
Up ahead we see a fork in the river approaching fast

NORMA
Which way

JACK
The left Water always flows
calmer toward the left Has to do
with the moon and the angle of the
sun I wrote about it in Iron Jack
And The Curse Of Confederate
Silver

Jack gives the boat everything the engine has Slowly but
surely they begin to pull away from the Italians

NORMA
I think we’re losing them

In the BG we see the Italian boat slowing down and heading to
the right of the fork

NORMA
They’re turning

JACK
They probably realized who they
were dealing with

NORMA
(slightly concerned)
Are you sure we’re going the right
way

JACK
As sure as I am there will never be
a better professional basketball
player than Mort Goldberg

CUT TO
AN HOUR LATER

The boat is now being THRASHED ABOUT IN CLASS 4 RAPIDS Jack
CLINGS to the wheel trying desperately to hold it steady

JACK
NOT TO WORRY THIS WILL END SOON
ENOUGH

The boat continues to be BATTERED by the waves
Back and forth its TOSSED for what seems like an eternity

Finally after what could be hours the rapids begin to
dissipate

Jack turns to Norma and smiles proudly

JACK
I can’t believe you doubted me
Typical No one ever wants to
believe that celebrities are
brilliant intellectuals whose views
on everything from world politics
to global temperature changes
matter but I’m here to tell you
that they do Big time

NORMA
What’s that sound

The two strain their ears and listen

JACK
Not sure Although if I had to
guess I’d say it’s the leaves of a
rubber tree plant otherwise known
as the ficus elastica blowing in
the wind

As the camera PULLS UP for a CRANE SHOT we now see that the
boat is heading straight for THE BLUE NILE FALLS

And over the falls the boat goes

Mum Jack and Norma bail out and HURTLE toward the CHURNING
foam of the falls
The three disappear below the rushing waters

The BOAT lands on a collection of jagged rocks and is SMASHED

into kindling
There’s a BEAT and Mum SURFACES Norma is up next

No sign of Jack Mum realizes what has to be done and

reluctantly dives below the surface A few seconds later he

emerges with Jack who’s GASPING for breath

NORMA
You stupid son of a

JACK
Don’t worry about me I’m OK How
about you two

The three swim to shore and FLOP down on the rocks
exhausted Norma is absolutely furious

NORMA
You could’ve gotten us killed

JACK
Have you ever noticed that you’re
always harping on the negative
You seem to be forgetting that we
eluded the Italians and found the
waterfall Which if I’m not
mistaken was our ultimate goal
Not to mention I saved that guy
Hitler’s life which has to count
for something

Norma stands revealing that her waterlogged dress is now

almost completely transparent

NORMA
(sarcastically)
I guess now all we have to do is
find the rainbow and our mission is
complete

As Jack stares at Norma his jaw drops
NORMA
What’s the matter Cat got your

tongue

Jack points to Norma’s glistening thighs

NORMA
What My baby maker You men are
all the same One track minds
It’s absolutely pathetic

JACKS POV Between Norma’s legs we see the base of a
RAINBOW

NORMA
You know what I’m tired of fending
off your juvenile advances If you

want to ride the pony express then
hop on board cowboy

Awkward SILENCE

JACK
I uh Actually if you could
just hold that thought

Jack continues to point behind her but Norma fails to
realize his intent

NORMA
(defensively)
No I will not hold that thought
Women have been told to hold their
thoughts throughout the ages but
the world is changing We are just
as capable as men and just as

Glancing over her shoulder Norma now sees the rainbow
created by waterfall’s ethereal mist

NORMA
Is that it

Jack shrugs It sure as hell looks like it
The three quickly make their way over to the waterfall’s
edge Jack studies the cascading wall of water trying to

figure out what’s next

NORMA
After you

Jack nods and step into the stream of water disappearing
from view Norma looks to Mum motions for him to follow
Mum SIGHS and does as he’s told Norma brings up the rear

INT WATERFALL CAVE - CONTINUOUS

As the three peer around the cave Jack’s gaze settles on a
pile of branches stacked in the corner of the grotto

Norma sees it as well

Jack walks over and kneels down He clears away the
branches revealing an old treasure chest inscribed with
Asian characters

Norma shakes her head in disbelief

NORMA
I don’t believe it

Jack smiles confidently

JACK
Ladies and gentlemen may I present
you the Black Diamond Of The
Orient

Jack opens the chest revealing a second part of the map
Which now points them towards Mount Kilimanjaro

Jacks confident grin quickly fades And the hunt continues
EXT WATERFALL - DAY

Norma studies the map while Jack and Mum collect supplies
that have washed up on shore

NORMA
According to the map we’re not far
from Lake Tana Id say a two day
hike at the most

JACK
What’s at Lake Tana

NORMA
Civilization Transportation back
to Cairo Our mission is over
Jack In case you’ve forgotten
our guide is probably dead

There’s a BEAT as Jack considers his options There don’t
appear to be many

NORMA
Jack youre a fiction writer
This is the real deal Lives are
at stake not to mention the
country’s financial future Let’s
face it you’re not cut out for
this type of thing None of us
are

Jack realizes she may be right but his ego is not about to
let her win Jack’s eyes narrow

JACK
You don’t know me at all do you

NORMA
I think I have a pretty good idea
of who you are

JACK
Oh really Well then what’s my
favorite color

NORMA
Blue
JACK
Lucky guess What about food
NORMA
Fiddlehead ferns
JACK
That could be anyone How about my
birthday
NORMA

Jack it’s over Let it go

JACK
Over This isn’t over Not by a
long shot Because when I make a
commitment I make a promise And
when I make a promise I make a
pledge And when I make a
pledge

NORMA
You take an oath

JACK
Now you’re getting it There are a
lot of people back home counting on
us and I’m not about to let ‘em
down now If you want to tag along
with Mum and I feel free But
were not heading back until we
have the diamond And that is a

guarantee

As Jack starts to BUSHWACK up the side of the mountain we
see a thin smile creeping across Normas lips She’s
impressed by Jack’s newfound dedication and resolve

HOOVER
You’re an idiot

EXT DESERT TRADING POST - DAY
Norma and Mum load up camels with supplies

Jack walks out of the post with his arm around a familiar
face Yankee legend LOU GEHRIG dressed in Safari gear

JACK
I was looking over at your
safari and I had to do a double
take Gehrig In the middle of
the Serengeti What are the odds
I guess the Yanks must’ve given you
quite a raise this year huh

Jack tosses a canister of oil to Norma

JACK
Here you go sweetheart a little
olive oil for sun protection

Just then a LOCAL MAN runs by chasing a small monkey-like
creature with a stick Jack and Lou watch with amusement as
the man tries unsuccessfully to swat the elusive animal

JACK
Take it easy fella He’s just a
harmless little rascal

The animal SCURRIES up Jack’s side and onto his shoulder It
begins to LICK his cheek Jack GIGGLES with delight

JACK
See what I mean

LOCAL MAN
(cautiously)
Be very careful mister The sun
squirrel carries many strange and
sometimes deadly diseases

Jack picks up the squirrel and gently pets its belly The
squirrel makes an adorable COOING SOUND

JACK
Don’t be ridiculous He’s as cute
as a button

Jack tosses the squirrel to Gehrig

JACK
Here you go Lou a little souvenir
to take back to New York I’11 bet
you dollars to donuts the Babe
doesn’t have one

LOU
Ow I think it just bit me

Jack ignores the comment and points to Norma

JACK
All right gang let’s get a move
on it
(to Gehrig)

Gehrig always a pleasure We’1l
have to throw a few back at
Dempsey’s the next time I hit the
Apple

Gehrig grimaces in pain as he rubs his arm where the animal
bit him
JUMP CUT TO

MINUTES LATER

Jack Norma and Mum (now on camelback) head off into the
desert as group of local tribal children run behind them
GIGGLING and SCREAMING Jack waves over his shoulder

JACK
Just remember kids school is
cool and masturbation is a sin
It’ll cause you to go blind and
sentence you to eternal damnation

Norma shoots Jack a disapproving look

JACK
I just love the little ones
They’re so pure and void of evil
How about that Gehrig huh Hell
of a ball player Do you know he
hasn’t missed a game in 5 years
The man is a picture of perfect
health

CUT TO
LATER THAT DAY

As the barren plains turn into desert sands we can tell that
there’s something on Norma’s mind Finally she speaks up

NORMA
I can’t believe what you said to
those children earlier

JACK
(confused)
What

NORMA
Filling their heads with lies
Self-gratification does not make
you go blind nor will it cause you
to go to hell

Jack studies Norma with a look of disbelief

JACK
Have you ever even been to church

NORMA
My father was a minister

JACK
Obviously not a very good one

NORMA
If you must know there are many
studies now that contend
masturbation is a natural impulse
which should be embraced rather
than repressed

JACK
I’m guessing these so called
“studies” were done at the school
for the blind

Jack SNICKERS at his own cleverness

NORMA
So you’re telling me you’ve never
pleasured yourself before

JACK
(seriously)
Absolutely not When someone tells
me something is a sin I listen

NORMA
I feel sorry for you Jack I
really do Because one of these
days you’re gonna open your eyes
and realize that it’s a new word
with new rules And unless you can
shake off the antiquated shackles
of the past you’re gonna get left
behind

As Norma rides up ahead Jack watches her contemplating the
wisdom of her words

INT TENT - NIGHT
Jack Norma and Mum are getting ready for bed

JACK
What you were saying earlier about
masturbation do you really believe
that

NORMA
I do indeed Why

JACK
(evasively)
No reason Just curious Well
good night

NORMA
Good night

Jack blows out the lantern The room becomes PITCH BLACK
For the rest of the scene WE SEE NOTHING

After a few moments we hear the unmistakable sound of a
person MASTURBATING It continues for a few seconds

NORMA
Jack

The MASTURBATING SOUND stops abruptly

JACK
Yeah

NORMA
Are you masturbating

JACK
(innocently)
- No

There’s a BEAT Extended silence

NORMA
Okay Well good night

JACK
Good night

After a few moments the sound begins again this time faster
and accompanied by low MOANS

NORMA
Are you sure you’re not
masturbating

Again the sound immediately stops There’s a BEAT

JACK
(breathless)
Yes Completely sure Well good
night

NORMA
Good night

Almost instantly the sound resumes Jack’s MOANS become
louder his breathing heavier and more labored

NORMA
Jack

The beat-off session continues

NORMA
(sharply)
Jack

The session slowly winds down finally stopping

JACK
(winded)
What’s with the 3rd degree I’m
just trying to go to sleep
(MORE)

JACK (contd)
And even if I was masturbating you
were the one who said it’s a
natural impulse that should be
embraced

NORMA
You’re right But we better get
some rest We have a long trip
ahead of us

JACK
Good idea

There’s a BEAT And then more you guessed it This time
Norma doesn’t say anything and the session continues The
MOANS become louder The BREATHING heavier

It becomes very very uncomfortable to listen to

Finally Jack screams

JACK
Oh god Oh god Oh god Quaker
Oates Ahhhhhhh

The tent is silent with the exception of Jack’s PANTING
After a few moments Jack speaks

JACK
Norma

NORMA
Yeah

JACK

Remember when I said I wasn’t
masturbating earlier

NORMA
Yeah

JACK
I was lying

NORMA
I know

JACK

Did you also know that it gives you
almost the exact same sensation as
whoopee

NORMA
Go to sleep Jack
SILENCE

JACK
I can still see

NORMA
Jack

JACK
Good night

EXT DESERT CAMP - DAY

Norma and Mum pack up camp as Jack looks over the map

Jack puts the map down

JACK
By my calculations we should be no
more than two days away from
Kilimanjaro

JACK
About last night

NORMA
Forget about it

JACK
No I want to thank you You
taught me a valuable lesson The
world IS changing And I can’t
close myself off to new things
Because if I do I’1ll miss out ona
lot of wonderful experiences

NORMA
(uncomfortably)
Seriously Jack let’s just drop
it
JACK

Consider it dropped But be aware
last night you helped a blind
man to see

(awkward silence)
Anyhoo before we commence on our
journey if you would excuse me for
a moment nature calls

Jack gazes around at his desert surroundings As one

expect
privacy

He forces an embarrassed smile

might

in the middle of the desert there’s not a lot of

JACK
(sotto)
Now how are we going to do this

Jack starts walking toward a giant sand dune After about 50
feet he stops and looks over his shoulder He sees Norma and
Mum looking back

Jack shrugs and continues walking After another 50 feet he
stops and looks back He’s still in view and appears rather
conflicted

Norma calls out

NORMA
We won’t look if that’s what
you’re worried about

Jack ignores the comment and trudges up the side of the
enormous dune its summit at least a quarter mile away

PANNING OVER to the ridge of another dune we see Giuseppe
and his henchmen watching Jack through binoculars

GIUSEPPE
How pathetic The brave American
is pee shy And we all know there
is only one reason for a man to be
pee shy
As Giuseppe and his henchmen SNICKER at the thought we
DISSOLVE TO
THIRTY MINUTES LATER

Jack standing alone on the other side of the dune finishes
up his urination He gives a shake and ZIPS up

As we PAN AROUND we quickly realize that Jack has actually
crested the dune for privacy There is NO ONE around

EXT DESERT CAMP - THIRTY MINUTES LATER

Jack returns to find Mum hog-tied and Norma and the map
missing Jack rushes over and unties Mum’s restraints

JACK
Let me guess Norma tied you up and
stole the map so she could have the
treasure all to herself

Mum stares at Jack with a look of disbelief He shakes his
head but Jack continues on

JACK
Greed is a powerful emotion my
friend It can make even the most
loyal of companions turn on their
closest of friends Then again I
always suspected that she was in
this for the money It’s the eyes
They’re windows to the soul And
looking into her eyes were like
looking into the soul of

Mum SLAPS Jack in the face There’s a BEAT And Jack nods
in understanding

JACK

The Italians took Norma and the
map That’s even worse Which way
did they go

EXT ITALIAN CAMP - NIGHT

A large canvas tent is set up next to a campfire Giuseppe
sipping on a glass of wine sits with Norma whose hands are
bound together

GIUSEPPE
Bellisima I apologize for the less
than pleasant accommodations but
it’s just a precaution You
understand right

NORMA
Jack was right about you Italians
You do have an offensive odor

GIUSEPPE
It’s actually a musk Elevated
levels of testosterone

EXT NEARBY SAND DUNE - SAME TIME
Jack and Mum quietly look on from the cover of darkness

JACK
Not to worry Mum I know exactly
what needs to be done This is
Iron Jacks forte the galloping
rescue We’1l be in and out before
they know what hit ‘em You just
follow my lead

Mum furrows his brow concerned

BACK TO -- THE CAMPFIRE

GIUSEPPE
I wonder where your Iron Jack is
now Still trying to muster the
courage to make piss maybe

NORMA
Don’t you worry about Jack he’1l
be here soon enough And when he
comes there’s gonna be hell to
pay that I guarantee

GIUSEPPE
(confused)
Are you sure about that Because
he seems rather inept And I’m not
being petty I honestly believe
that

Just then we hear a loud “YA” and Jack comes GALLOPING in
on camelback from out of the darkness

JACK
Like the wind Mum Like the wind

Jack skillfully leaps over the campfire As the Italians
rush to get their weapon Jack makes another pass through the
camp and holds out his hand to Norma

JACK
Next stop Times Square

Norma reaches up and grabs hold of Jack’s hand It looks as
if Jack has saved the day However

As he tries to SWING Norma up onto the camel he loses his
balance and TOPPLES off of his mount He lands hard on top
of Norma THUNK

Giuseppe and his soldiers quickly surround the two
GIUSEPPE
(snidely)

I’m confused do I pay hell now or

must I wait
Just then
Mum comes GALLOPING out of the shadows
With a dexterous swipe of his machete he SEVERS the tent

pole line causing the canopy to fall onto Giuseppe and his
men

Mum reaches down and in one swift motion grabs BOTH Jack
and Norma and SWINGS them onto the back of his camel

JACK
Good one old chap Just like we
planned

As the three gallop off into the darkness the other camels
following we see Giuseppe emerging from beneath the fallen
tent His eyes burning with hatred

GIUSEPPE
You might’ve won this battle
Signori Jack but the war still
rages

EXT DESERT - DAY
Jack Mum and Norma slowly ride across desert sands

NORMA
If I didn’t get the chance to thank
you last night I really appreciate
what you and Mum did It was very
brave

JACK
(shrugging)
Rescuing damsels in distress is
what Iron Jack does Then again
it’s a shame my saddle came loose
But that’s why we have backup
plans now isn’t it

The two share a brief smile Jack looks up at the scorching
sun and wipes his brow

JACK
Man it’s hot out huh

Jack begins to quaff down an entire canteen of water pouring
the tail end of it over his head

NORMA
Id go easy on the water Jack We
only have a limited supply

JACK
You worry too much According to
my calculations we shouldnt be
more than

Jack studies the map with a look of confusion

JACK (CONTD)
It’s not far Not far at all
DISSOLVE TO
A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS

-- Jack continues to drink water at an alarming rate Norma
looks on concerned

-- Much to Norma’s chagrin Jack washes his camel with a
considerable amount of their remaining water

-- Jack uses even more of their precious water to clean his
socks Norma couldn’t be more irritated

-- Finally the group runs out of water Norma glares at
Jack eyes like daggers

-- The group grows weaker and weaker as they become more and
more dehydrated

-- The group is now running on fumes Jack and Norma are
barely conscious

As the three ride along Jack deliriously points up ahead to
what appears to be a desert resort

JACK
Civilization I told you we were
close

Jack proceeds to gallop toward the resort which we now see
is nothing more than a heat induced mirage

CUT TO
INT CABANA - DAY -- A DREAM SEQUENCE

Jack reclines on a canopied bed sipping a martini while
reading The Bible

There’s a KNOCK on the door and Norma enters now dressed as
a sexy harem girl She looks absolutely breathtaking

NORMA
I hope I’m not disturbing you

JACK
Not at all I was just finishing
up a little light reading

Jack puts down The Bible Norma comes over and takes a seat
on the edge of the bed

NORMA
Anyway I just wanted to apologize
for doubting you

JACK
Mistakes happen

NORMA
No seriously I underestimated
you You are a very intelligent
and attractive man who deserves the
utmost respect You are wise
beyond your years

JACK
I appreciate that It takes a brave
woman to admit when she’s wrong

Norma takes the glass from Jack’s hand and sets it on the
bedside table

NORMA
Let’s cut the crap JB I want you
and you want me It’s time to
throw caution to the wind and let
nature take over

JACK
Are you talking about

NORMA
That’s right premarital
intercourse
Norma POUNCES on Jack and begins to RIP his clothes off

Where Jack sunburned and shirtless is attempting to have
sex with the FOOT OF A CAMEL

PANNING UP we see Mum staring down at Jack with a bemused
expression Mum reaches down and taps Jack on the shoulder

Jack looks up and grins coolly
JACK
Well hello beautiful You want in
As I always say the more the

merrier

JACKS HALLUCINATING POV Mum is another sexy harem girl

As Jack tries to pull Mum into the sordid mess we
CUT TO
A MONTAGE

Of Mum carrying Jack who’s now passed out over the desert
sands through thick brush across rivers and plains

-- Mile after mile he goes as Jack sleeps soundly
-- The sun sets and through the night Mum goes

-- Just before daybreak Mum finds the camp he left Norma at
and gently lays Jack next to the campfire

EXT CAMPFIRE - MORNING

As the first rays of sunlight appear on the horizon Jack
begins to stir Opening his eyes hes shocked to discover
that theyre camping at the base of Mt Kilimanjaro

Jack shakes his head in disbelief He looks over at Mum
who’s busy preparing breakfast

JACK
(proudly)

Well what do you know old friend
it looks like my instincts were
right all along Mum you need to
learn to trust me Ive gota
gift Not sure where it comes
from but its obvious that I’ve
been blessed by a higher power

As Jack pours a cup of coffee Norma awakes YAWNS Looking
up at the majestic mountain her eyes go wide with awe

NORMA
Where are we

JACK
Mount Kilimanjaro

NORMA
But how

JACK

(proudly)

Let’s just say that Jack Bell knows
a thing or two about navigating
desert terrain It’s like a sixth
sense A desert terrain
navigational sense

Just then Norma points to a magnificent ALBINO LION staring
at their camp from a hundred yards away It’s beauty is
mesmerizing

NORMA
It’s magnificent

JACK
So majestic So regal So noble

Jack picks up his rifle and takes aim at the animal

NORMA
(horrified)
What are you doing

JACK
Just using the scope to get a
better

Norma impulsively grabs Jack’s arm causing him to
accidentally pull the trigger POW

The lion drops to the ground DEAD

JACK (CONTD)
- Look

There’s a BEAT as Jack and Norma realize what’s happened

NORMA
I thought you were going to

JACK
Shoot it Why would I shoot the
most beautiful creature that God
ever created Lucky for you
there’s no game warden around or
you would be in some serious

Just then fifty spears DESCEND from the sky and LAND at
their feet Whoops

JACK (CONTD)
» trouble

A WHIP PAN reveals that the camp is now surrounded by 100
half-dressed tribal warriors

NORMA
(sarcastically)
Yeah lucky for us

EXT TRIBAL VILLAGE - DAY

PANNING AROUND the village it’s readily apparent that the
albino lion was some sort of sacred animal It’s likeness is
captured on everything from paintings to etchings to
carvings

We ANGLE ON Jack Norm and Mum who are now tethered to
wooden steaks The locals are laying kindling at their feet

JACK
What are they going to do to us

NORMA
I’m not entirely familiar with
their language but from what I can
decipher we’ve murdered the sacred
protector of their village and they
plan to do the same to us Except
with fire

JACK
Fire That’s BS Being burned
alive is much worse than being shot
with a rifle Much worse

As the tribe’s CHIEF approaches the three interlopers with a
burning torch it looks like the end However

Just then a low AGONIZING MOAN can be heard coming from one
of the huts The chief’s wife emerges grief stricken

The assemblage grows QUIET
She calls out to the chief who reluctantly lowers the torch
The two have a heated exchange

JACK
What are they saying

NORMA
Something about an evil spirit and
their son It sounds like he’s
quite ill
This gives Jack an idea

JACK
Ill huh

As a sly smile creeps across Jack’s lips we

CUT TO

INT HUT - MINUTES LATER

Jack holding a knife stands over the prince who’s sweating
and shaking profusely The chief points to Jack

CHIEF
Doctor
JACK
The next best thing writer You

see I once wrote an essay on the
health benefits of mercury for the
Royal Journal Of Medicine And
while Ive technically never been
to medical school I have been
deputized by the Surgeon General

Jack pulls out his deputy badge for emphasis

As the prince begins to GROAN Jack returns his focus on the
business at hand

JACK
(sotto)
Now where should I make this
incision

Jack impulsively plunges the knife into the prince’s abdomen
and BLOOD BEGINS TO SPURT into the air

JACK
Whoops

CHIEF
Whoops

JACK

Not to worry I just need to make
another cut here

Jack plunges the blade into the prince’s stomach This time
BLOOD SPURTS all over Jack’s face

JACK
Just relax This is completely
normal I know exactly what went
wrong If I make one more incision
here

Another incision causes blood to SPURT across the room like a
sprinkler system And we

JUMP CUT TO

MINUTES LATER
The prince is now violently convulsing on his cot

Jack Norma and Mum are being tied up once again and
dragged toward the pyre

NORMA
Any other bright ideas

JACK
Maybe you should tell him I once
sang a duet with Al Jolson at a
Fight Against Polio fund raiser
Let him know that I even wore a
black face If he’s interested I
still know the routine

NORMA
Not sure that’s a wise decision

Suddenly Jack’s eyes light up as inspiration strikes

JACK
The diamond Moreno said it had
magical healing powers

NORMA
He also said human flesh tasted
like quail

JACK
Can you think of a better
alternative

Norma realizes Jack might have a point She calls out to the
chief in their native tongue and the crowd goes silent

CUT TO
EXT VILLAGE - DAY

Jack and Mum prepare to head up the mountain Norma is being
held as collateral

JACK
Don’t you worry about a thing doll-
face we’ll be back with the
diamond before you can say Iron
Jack and The Curse Of Captain Kid’s
Treasure Which by the way The
Times called a “literary thrill
ride that will keep you on the edge
of your seat”

NORMA
Are you promoting your latest
novel

JACK

You never know where Pulitzer
voters might be vacationing

There’s a BEAT as we PAN OVER to the assemblage of half-
naked tribe members As expected -- NO PULITZER VOTERS

EXT MOUNTAIN - DAY

Jacks energetically bounds up the mountain path as Mum whos
carrying ALL of the equipment tries to keep up

JACK
There’s something about mountain
air that just fills you with energy
and life If we keep up this pace
well make it to the summit by
nightfall Come on pal Youre
dragging here No pain no gain

Off in the distance we see a plane flying by the Italian
flag painted on its side

CUT TO
THREE HOURS LATER

Jack is now breathing heavily and sweating profusely He’s
desperately trying to keep up with Mum

JACK
The air so thin Feeling so
dizzy

Jack sits down and lights a cigarette

JACK
Break time I need to
replenish lung power

CUT TO

MUM NOW CARRYING JACK AND THEIR EQUIPMENT

JACK
I appreciate this Mum I
really do And you know perfectly
well that I would be doing the same
for you if the roles were reversed

Mum ignores the comment and forges ahead
CUT TO
THE SUMMIT

Winds howling Snow swirling Jack and Mum stand before the
mouth of a cave

Jack holds up the treasure map revealing this is clearly the
place they were looking for

JACK
One of us should head inside to
scout things out You may as well
take this one I mean with my bum
lungs and all

Mum SIGHS He takes a lantern and heads toward the entrance
of the cave As he nears the opening we see a pair of
yellow eyes peering out of the shadows

There’s a loud GROWL Just then a set of claws VIOLENTLY
LASH out from within the darkness barely missing Mum’s face
Mum slowly backs away from the cave

JACK
Just as I suspected a snow leopard
den

Mum stares hard at Jack as if to say “WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU
MEAN JUST AS I SUSPECTED

JACK
This is gonna require teamwork
pal The old one-two You up for
it

Off Mum’s look of dread we

CUT TO
MINUTES LATER
Jack ties pieces of RAW MEAT onto the back of Mum’s jacket

JACK
All right amigo here’s the plan
youll lure the cat out of its lair
and I’1l sneak in grab the
diamond and we’1l blow this
clambake like a call girl ina
balloon store What do you say

Mum stares at Jack with a look of impending doom

JACK
Good luck old friend and Godspeed

Jack gives Mum a pat on the back and sends him toward the
cave Mum takes a deep breath and enters the darkness

Theres a BEAT Jack looks on intently

After a few seconds we hear a vicious feline GROWL and Mum
comes SPRINTING out of the cave followed by the snow leopard

The leopard LEAPS into the air and LANDS on Mums back
TACKLING him to the ground

As Mum tries to fend off the ferocious beast Jack give him
the thumbs up

JACK

That’a boy Mum Give him the old

what for A little of the old

razzle-dazzle
And Jack enters the cave
INT CAVE - CONTINUOUS
Jack lights a lantern and slowly forays into the darkness
As he moves deeper and deeper into the cavern we begin to see
tribal markings etched on the wall The etchings all have
ominous and forboding implications They depict decapitation

impalement and immolation

Continuing on we begin to see bones many appearing to be
human littering the cave’s floor

Without paying attention Jack steps on a hidden trip wire

A GIANT BLADE swings down just missing Jack’s head
Jack quickens his pace

Finally he reaches what appears to be a dead end There’s
nothing but a rock wall in front of him

Jack gazes around the room a look of bewilderment painted
across his face

Spying a stalagmite Jack grins knowingly

JACK
Of course By pulling the concealed
lever the secret door will open
revealing the hidden passage It’s
just like in Iron Jack And The
Curse Of The Gold Mine’s Gold

Jack confidently attempts to pull the tip of the stalagmite
but nothing happens He tries again Still nothing

JACK
That’s odd

Jack tries KICKING the stalagmite Nothing One more kick
this time harder Again nothing The next kick BREAKS off
the tip of the rock and it falls to the ground THUD

Jack picks up the piece of broken rock and studies it
confused It suddenly dawns on him that there might not be a
hidden lever after all We can see his frustration building

JACK
Come on You have to be here
Because if you’re not then the
prince is going to die and Norma
is going to die and Mum and I are
going to Actually I guess Mum
and I could just take a different
route down the mountain and avoid
the village all together

Jack takes a moment to consider the possibility

JACK (CONTD)
My point being we’ve come this
far can’t you just help us out
Just give me a little hint as to
where you might be Just a tiny
one

There’s a BEAT Jack waits for an answer to his prayer but
nothing arrives He shakes his fists in anger

JACK
Damn you legendary ancient artifact
which may or may not actually
exist Damn you straight to hell

Jack throws the piece of broken stalagmite against the ice-
covered wall SMASH The ice SHATTERS revealing a formerly
unseen stone knob It’s clearly something important

Jack walks up and studies the knob Presses it

Just then an unseen trapdoor OPENS beneath Jacks feet He
DROPS down onto an ice chute and begins to TUMBLE into the
darkness

JACK
Ahhhh

Down he goes SCREAMING like a little girl He lands with a
THUD on a hard stone floor

Jack lights a match illuminating the room which he now sees
is filled with the frozen remains of a dozen or so former
treasure hunters

Again Jack SCREAMS like a little girl this time even more
high-pitched

When he finally stops he sees a wooden pedestal on which
sits a neatly folded silk scarf There appears to be
something wrapped inside

Could it be Jack hurries over and excitedly unwraps the
scarf revealing The Black Diamond Of The Orient

EXT CAVE - DAY

Jack emerges to find the snow leopard curled up at Mum’s
feet gnawing on a piece of steak

JACK
Awww isn’t that adorable You’ve
made a friend Let me guess you
pacified the kitty cat with a
little of the old soft shoe

Mum puts his finger to his lips but Jack ignores the warning
and walks up to the leopard and begins to tap dance

Softly singing

JACK
Everybody loves to tap
White Irish

Suddenly the snow leopard POUNCES sinking it’s teeth into
Jack’s neck Jack howls

JACK
AHHH THE BEAST IS EATING MY
THROAT HE’S CRUSHING MY TRACHEA
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING I WAS ONLY
TAPPING I WAS ONLY
TAPPING

As the leopard continues to MAUL Jack we
CUT TO
INT ROYAL HUT - DAY

Jack and Mum come running into the hut breathless Jack
proudly holds out the scarf containing the diamond

JACK
Get the prince ready We’ve found
the

Jack stops in his tracks

JACK (CONTD)
diamond

PANNING OVER we now see that Giuseppe and his Italian
henchmen are standing in the corner of the of the room guns
drawn Giuseppe shakes his head in disbelief

GIUSEPPE
You actually did it I’m
shocked Amazed even You
actually found it Unbelievable

Giuseppe walks up and grabs the scarf from Jack’s hand

JACK
What are you doing

GIUSEPPE
Taking the diamond back to mother
Italy and General Mussolini

Giuseppe SNAPS his fingers and his henchmen follow him out of
the hut Jack and Norma rush after them

EXT HUT - CONTINUOUS

JACK
But what about the prince

GIUSEPPE
What about him

JACK
The diamond can save him It’s his
only chance

Giuseppe considers the request and smiles apologetically

GIUSEPPE
I wish I could really but if I
let you use the diamond to heal the
prince then I’d have to let
everyone use the diamond

JACK
But there is no one else Just the
prince

GIUSEPPE
Maybe now But when word gets
out You know how it is Anyway

we have to be getting back to
Italy But if you’re ever in Rome
definitely stop by I’m sure
General Mussolini would like to
thank you for your efforts

We hear the WHIR of a plane propeller beginning to spin A
few seconds later a large twin-prop comes RUMBLING out from
behind the huts

Giuseppe runs over and climbs aboard He smiles and waves

GIUSEPPE
Ciao

Jack and Norma watch as the aircraft speeds across the plain
and ascends into the cloudless blue sky

INT HUT - DAY

Norma and Mum pack up their belongings while Jack sits in the
corner pouting

JACK
This is not the way things were
supposed to end We were the ones
who found the diamond We’re the
heroes It’s just not fair

We ANGLE ON a folded piece of paper falling out of one of the
bags Norma is packing

Norma picks it up revealing it to be a telegram from Hoover
to Toby

“We need more photographs of Bell in front of famous
landmarks STOP As long as the pictures keep coming and
he and the reporter believe the mission is real were
golden STOP Keep up the good work H Hoover”
JACK
What do you have there

Norma quickly places the telegram behind her back

NORMA
(evasively)
Nothing
JACK

Oh really Then why are you hiding
it behind your back like it
possesses an important secret

Before Norma can answer Jack rips the telegram from her
grasp Begins to read

JACK
“We need more photographs of Bell
in front of famous landmarks As
long as the pictures keep coming
and he and the reporter believe the
mission is real”

Jack reads the rest in silence

NORMA
Jack

As the reality of the situation hits Jack like a ton of
bricks we can see the devastation on his face

JACK

(in a daze)
This was all a lie

(beat)
An elaborate publicity stunt to
promote a fictional endeavor Kind
of like my career

(beat)
The irony So cruel

NORMA
What are you talking about

JACK
I’m a fraud I’ve never done any
of the things I write about It
was just a hook my agent came up
with to sell more books But then
it caught on and before we knew
it the whole Iron Jack persona-
thing sort of took on a life of its
own

Jacks shoulder’s slump His despair palpable Norma gently
pats him on the back

NORMA
Hey Jack You’re forgetting that
you accomplished what none of them
ever thought you would You found
the diamond and that’s something
they can never take away from you

Jack shrugs indifferently

NORMA
Not only that you found it on your
own terms No help from the
government at all It was just you
and your misguided instincts

Jack looks up his confidence slowly returning

JACK
You think

NORMA
I know I was there

Jack nods proudly He stands up straight and sticks out his
chest

JACK

Youre absolutely right It WAS my
misguided instincts that found the
diamond

(becoming more animated)
Well you know what Finding the
diamond isn’t enough Iron Jack
sees his missions through to the
end and that’s exactly what we’re
going to do

NORMA
We are

JACK
It’s not about the glory anymore
It’s about right and wrong And as
long as there’s still time to save
the prince’s life we’re not giving
up

Jack narrows his eyes

JACK (CONTD)
I swore years ago I would never
return to that hellish land of
winos and dandies but sometimes in
life you have go back on your word
Especially when doing so will
benefit you in the future So pack
up your corkscrews and your male
perfume because we are going to
Italy

DISSOLVE TO
EXT ITALIAN AIRFIELD -— DAY

Norma and Mum step out of an idling transport plane onto the
tarmac

INT PLANE - SAME TIME
Jack smiles warmly at the pilot

JACK
Amelia you’re a lifesaver I
can’t thank you enough for the
lift And good luck with that
‘round the world thing I know
you’re gonna do great

As the pilot turns around we now see that it’s none other
than AMELIA EARHART She points to Norma and smiles

AMELTA
She’s a keeper Jack

JACK
Don’t I know it lLet’s hope I can
hang on to her better than I did to
you

As Jack goes to exit the plane we go TIGHT ON his jacket
getting caught on an small electrical device

As Jack hops down onto the tarmac the device is dislodged
from the circuitry and remains attached to Jack’s coat

EXT TARMAC - CONTINUOUS

Jack walks over to Norma and Mum They watch as Amelia turns
the plane around and prepares for takeoff

NORMA
That Amelia Earhart is one nice
woman

As the plane heads down the runway we go TIGHT ON the
ELECTRICAL DEVICE hanging from the back of Jacks coat

JACK
The nicest

CUT TO
EXT ROME - NIGHT
Jack Mum and Norma walk down a busy pedestrian thoroughfare

JACK
Welcome to Rome the land of
effeminately dressed men and
mustachioed women

Norma raises a curious eyebrow

NORMA
I’m not sure I follow your Italian
stereotyping Jack Everyone
appears fairly normal to me

JACK
Appears is the key word You see
Italians aren’t so much people as
they are beasts Savage blood-
thirsty voluptuary beasts

EXT CASTLE - NIGHT

As the three approach the castle we now see that Norma is
wearing a fake mustache

NORMA
This is ridiculous Jack
JACK
Maybe so but it’s a risk we have

to take
As the three near the castle’s guards

NORMA
What now

JACK
Not to worry I did extensive
research on the Italian dialect for
my first novel Welcome To Goombah
Town It never sold but it got me
an agent

Jack raises his voice

JACK
(in a bad Italian accent)
I’ma so drunk ona red wine I just
urinated ina my trousers

Jack walks up to one of the guards and plants a big KISS on
his lips

JACK
I lova you my guinea-wop brother

Jack SMACKS the guard in the face

JACK
I lova you soa much

Jack PUNCHES the guard in the jaw knocking him out The
other guard begins to LAUGH

JACK
And I lova you too

Another right-cross and the guard is down for the count
Jack flashes a cool smile at Norma
JACK
I used to live next door to Gene
Tunney He showed me few things

INT CASTLE - NIGHT

Jack purposefully strides down a hallway as Norma and Mum
follow closely behind

NORMA
Do you know where you’re going

JACK
Years of observing the Italian race
trying to acclimate to civilized
society has taught me that there is
only one thing their people find
more valuable than money

And we ANGLE ON a door labeled “WINE CELLAR”
INT WINE CELLAR - A MINUTE LATER

The three enter into the wine filled catacombs

JACK (CONTD)
You see the Italians were
originally descendents of wild
boar

NORMA
(confused)
As in pigs

JACK
That’s right And as most farmers
know a swine’s favorite food is
the grape However not just fresh
sweet grapes from the vine but
rather rancid decomposing grapes
that have fallen to the ground and
have begun to ferment

Jack picks up a bottle of wine for emphasis

JACK (CONTD)
Which as you know is basically all
that wine is It also explains an
Italian’s inability to stay sober
More importantly this also means
that their most priceless
possessions are going to be kept
somewhere close to the vino

WHIP PAN to a glass case containing the Black Diamond sitting
in the center of a rack of wine

NORMA
(stunned)
Well I’11 be damned

GIUSEPPE (0S)
Truer words were never spoken

Out of the shadows steps Giuseppe

GIUSEPPE
To come here was not a wise
decision

Giuseppe grabs a decorative dueling saber from the wall He
begins to skillfully TWIRL and SWIPE it through the air

JACK
(coolly)
That may be so However wisdom has
never been one of my strong suits

Jack grabs another saber from the wall and tries to emulate
Giuseppe

GIUSEPPE
You do know that there is no editor
here to clean up your mistakes
Signori Jack

JACK
Thats fine by me Jennifer One
draft is all Im gonna need

Giuseppe flashes a seductive smile at Norma

GIUSEPPE
Maybe after Im through here I
will show you what its like to be
with a real man

JACK
(to Norma)
You do realize that this guy still
lives with his mother right

GIUSEPPE
Mi madre is a saint

Giuseppe LUNGES at Jack and a wild sword fight ensues Back
and forth they go

-- Giuseppe with the THRUST Jack with a DODGE
-- Giuseppe with the HACK Jack with the BLOCK

-- Giuseppe SWINGS at the legs Jack JUMPS into the air just
over the blade

GIUSEPPE
I have to be honest with you I am
impressed I thought you would be
less skilled with the sword

Jack BLOCKS another blow

JACK
Three-time captain of the Hunter
College fencing team And as long
as we’re all being honest I
thought Italian men had smaller
vaginas

Giuseppe takes a wild swing that SMASHES a wine rack

GIUSEPPE
As an Italian man I find that
comment to be extremely insulting
JACK
Then maybe Italian men are smarter
than I had previously suspected

GIUSEPPE
Again with the insults

Back and forth they go Jack doing everything in his power
to fend off Giuseppe’s deadly blows

Just when it looks like Jack is about to meet his maker Mum
grabs a sword from the wall and joins in

The tide quickly turns
Mum and Jack proceed to take the upper hand

GIUSEPPE
Two on one is not a fair fight

JACK
It’s not my fault you don’t have a
man-servant
Finally Giuseppe loses his sword It would appear as if
Jack and Mum have emerged victorious But Giuseppe has other
plans

GIUSEPPE
Maybe I don’t need one

Giuseppe pulls a pistol out of his jacket He aims at Mum

GIUSEPPE (CONTD)
And maybe you don’t either

In SLOW MOTION we see Giuseppe pulling the trigger
FLASHBACK TO

MUMS LIFESAVING ACCOMPLISHMENTS

-- Playing Russian Roulette in Casablanca

-- Pulling Jack out of the water at the Blue Nile Falls

-- Rescuing Jack and Norma at the Giuseppe’s desert camp

-- Carrying Jack up Kilimanjaro

-- Luring the snow leopard out of its cave

JACK
NOOOOO00O0000

Jack DIVES in front of Mum and the bullet HITS him squarely
in the chest Jack drops to the ground clutching his heart

Impulsively Norma picks up a priceless Da Vinci statue and
CRACKS Giuseppe over the head knocking him unconscious

She rushes over to Jack’s side

NORMA
Jack are you OK

JACK
(weakly)
So cold I can see a bright light
It’s beautiful

Norma cradles Jack’s head gently in her arms

NORMA
Don’t you die on us Jack Bell
Not now Not after we came this
far

Jack turns to Mum Through thin labored breaths he
whispers

JACK

Mum you were more to me than a man-
servant You were a man who
also happened to be a servant And
sweet Norma I only wish we had
more time together

(COUGHS )
It’s not too late for you Or the
prince Take the stone and go save
that sweet kid’s life Take it

There’s a BEAT as Norma realizes there may be another
option

NORMA
Can’t we just use the stone to save
your life

JACK
I wish there was time But the
grim reaper has planted his supple
lips upon my own and placed his
gentle kiss of death upon my soul

NORMA
(confused)
No I’m serious If the stone has
magical healing powers we should

Jack put his finger to Norma’s lips

JACK
Shhhh You must try and let me go

NORMA
I don’t understand why you’re
making this so difficult

JACK
I had a good run No regrets
Which is really all a man can ask
for

As Norma touches Jack’s wound we see a look of confusion
wash across her face

Slowly she begins to unbutton his shirt revealing that the
bullet didn’t actually puncture Jack’s skin but is instead
imbedded in his Surgeon General’s Deputy Badge

Jack looks down and forces a sheepish smile
JACK
Well that was lucky It still
hurts really bad and I’m sure it
will leave some kind of unsightly
bruise
We hear FOOTSTEPS coming down the corridor

NORMA
We’ve got to get out of here

JACK
I think I can make it

Norma helps Jack to his feet

JACK
Ow Very tender

EXT THE CASTLE’S AIRFIELD - NIGHT

Jack Mum and Norma are crouched behind a storage shed under
heavy machine gun fire

NORMA
Now what

Jack peers out and spots a biplane parked fifty feet away

knowing smile spreads across his lips

JACK

While researching Iron Jack And The

Curse Of The Red Barrons Silver

I

spent a day at an Air Force base in

Lompoc They even let me try out
the flight simulator I am almost

positive I can get this bird
airborne

NORMA

What’s almost positive Like 99

98

JACK
Probably closer to 12 You guys
ready On the count of three
One Two Three

And Jack sprints across the airfield machine gun fire just
missing him and dives into the cockpit There’s a BEAT

Mum and Norma consider alternative options
there are none

NORMA
After you

Unfortunately

Mum nods and the two dash after Jack and pile into the

plane bullets WHIZZING over their heads
Jack intently studies the control panel

JACK
I think this is the ignition

Jack FLIPS a switch and the propeller begins to SPIN

JACK
And I believe this is the rudder

as

Jack FLIPS another switch and the plane’s machine guns begin
to FIRE peppering a bunker of enemy soldiers with bullet

holes

JACK
Maybe this is the rudder

Jack FLIPS another switch and the plane begins to turn in a
circle its machine gun CUTTING DOWN everything in its path

JACK
So all I need to do is pull this
lever back
Jack pulls the lever and the plane begins to MOTOR down the
runway As the plane continues to accelerate we see the end
of the runway drawing near

NORMA
Jack

JACK
I got it

Jack pulls the wheel back and nothing happens He tries
again Still nothing

NORMA
Jack

JACK
Almost there

The end of the runway is approaching quickly

NORMA
Jack

At the last possible second Jack PULLS a lever and the plane
RISES UP into the sky Jack looks back at Norma and grins

JACK
Piece of cake sister

As the plane soars above the airfield Jack lights a victory
cigarette

JACK
Now that is smooth

Jack takes a deep drag and tosses the cigarette overboard
ON THE GROUND

Giuseppe rushes out of the castle and points to the anti-
aircraft guns

GIUSEPPE
Shoot him down Now

As the soldiers run over to the guns we go TIGHT ON Jack’s
lit cigarette butt falling to the ground

We see it heading straight for the airfield’s GAS PUMPS

As the soldiers begin to FIRE at Jack’s plane we see the
cigarette land directly in a puddle of gasoline setting it
ablaze Within seconds the flames crawl up into the pump
and

BOOM

As the airfield EXPLODES into a giant FIREBALL we
DISSOLVE TO

INT MANJARO HUT - DAY

Jack gently places the stone on the prince’s stomach and
takes a step back He looks to Norma for guidance

JACK
What now

NORMA
I don’t know

Suddenly the stone begins to glow and a HUSH falls over the
room The prince’s body goes RIGID and his back ARCHES
forcing his chest into the air The prince lets out a GASP

Slowly one of his eyes open Then the other He looks up
at his mother and father and smiles blankly

PRINCE
(SUBTITLED)
What happened

The prince’s mother runs over and gives him a loving embrace
A loud CHEER erupts from the villagers

EXT HUT — DAY
Norma smiles warmly at Jack

NORMA
I never thought Id say this but
you are a pretty extraordinary man
Mr Bell

JACK
I have my moments And please
call me Jack

Jack takes Norma into his arms and PLANTS a passionate kiss
on her lips She pushes him away and SLAPS him across the
face

Jack grins and SLAPS her back

He delivers another forceful KISS until Norma eventually
succumbs to his seductive “charms”

NORMA
Oh Jack

EXT VILLAGE CENTER - NIGHT

A celebratory feast is taking place complete with dancers

fire jugglers and copious amounts of food

Norma sits with the chief and his family including the
prince who’s now the model of perfect health

What happened to Jack

NORMA

He said he had a surprise for you

The man is full of them

NORMA
SUBTITLED)
Yes he is

Just then the sound of a ukulele is heard off in the
distance All eyes turn to see Jack stepping out of one
the huts strumming the instrument

And one more thing he’s now in BLACKFACE
Jack begins to sing the Al Jolson classic “Mammy”

JACK
Mammy Mammy

CUT TO
EXT VILLAGE - DAY

Mum loads up the plane as Jack hands out cigarettes to the
Manjaro children

JACK
Remember kids you’re still growing
so be sure to smoke up Your body
needs its tobacco vitamins

Jack turns to the chief and smiles warmly

JACK
Chief I just want to thank you for
your hospitality If you and the
missus are ever in Beverly Hills
youve always got a place to crash

Jack motions for Norma to translate

NORMA
(SUBTITLED)
He apologizes for any trouble he
may have caused you and hopes you
have a healthy and prosperous life

The chief nods

CHIEF
(SUBTITLED )
You are the strangest and least
civilized man I have ever met But
you saved my son’s life which is
something I will never forget

NORMA
He says it was an honor to meet you
and he hopes your paths will cross
again in the near future

Jack gives the chief a hug

JACK
You big softie
NORMA
(SUBTITLED)
He wants you to know that he
received a severe head injury as a
child

CHIEF
(SUBTITLED)
Makes sense

TEN MINUTES LATER

Jack Norma and Mum wave to the villagers as the
begins to RUMBLE down the makeshift runway

Up into the clear African sky it soars

As they circle high above the village Jack turns
Norma Over the din of the engine

JACK
There’s something I want to tell
you And it’s hard for me to

say
NORMA
There’s no need I feel the same
way
JACK

I’m 18th Jewish I know I don’t
have the nose or the horns so it’s
not readily apparent but there’s
yid blood pumping though these here
veins

NORMA
(confused)
OK

JACK
There’s more My great-great-—
grandfather was Irish

There’s a BEAT

NORMA
Jack I have to be honest with you
I have never understood your
irrational fear and loathing of the
Irish

JACK
Really

plane

back to

NORMA
Seriously the Irish aren’t that
bad I mean not like Italians or
Swedes

JACK
So you wouldn’t have second
thoughts about leaving me alone
with the family dog

NORMA
You said you’re only 116 right

Norma CHUCKLES good-naturedly Jack begins to LAUGH as well

NORMA
Of course the family cat is a
whole other story

JACK
Well I do have a thing for pussy

As Jacks LAUGHTER becomes more boisterous Norma grows
silent

JACK

What I was just You know
cats pussy

(changing the subject)
So uh do you guys know anything
about zeppelins I have a friend
Hindenburg whos looking for
investors

As the plane soars into the blue sky we

DISSOLVE TO
NEWSREEL FOOTAGE
Of Jack Norma and Mum stepping off of an ocean liner

NARRATOR (VO)
And in other news Jack Bell
returns safe and sound from the
wilds of Africa And while he
might not have found the Black
Diamond he ended up with his own
precious stone Times reporter
Norma Madsen who recently became
Norma Bell

CUT TO

EXT CHURCH - DAY

Jack and Norma in wedding attire emerge from the church as
well-wishers shower them with rice

NARRATOR (CONTD)
What’s up next for Iron Jack is
anybody’s guess But you can bet
it will be something full of
adventure and intrigue

Jack and Norma wave to the crowd and step into a waiting
limousine

We see Jack’s brother Gerald also wearing a tuxedo being
led out of the church on a chain leash He LUNGES at the
limo but his handlers subdue him with an electric cattle
prod

As the limo starts down the street it passes a disheveled
bearded man holding up a sign that says “Will Work For Food”

It takes a moment but we quickly realize that this
downtrodden lost soul is none other than former United
States President Herbert Hoover

FADE OUT
