First of all this place is not
cheap Downtown’s coming back

MR BINKS
From what Armageddon

AARON

for the two of us

MR BINKS

INT AARON AND DAPHNE’S LOFT APARTMENT

and they are of love

MR BINKS
You don’t and they aren’t You’re
not right for her She’s a flighty
girl She needs someone more
grounded

AARON

She’s an amazing sculptor It just
takes a while to break into the art
world

(clearly repeated from a

speech Daphne has said)
You have to apprentice first and
even just to get the apprenticeship
can take years but art isn’t about
money it’s about --

MR BINKS
I’m not going to debate my
daughter’s future with you She’s
a cute girl who needs to land a
rich husband before she pops out a
few grand kids and ends up teaching
art in an elementary school

AARON
I think she’s talented

MR BINKS
The world has too much talent and
not enough customers Here’s the
deal quit playing house like a
little girl You’re in the music
biz Go out party like a rock
star experiment with drugs go
apeshit crazy so you don’t end up
doing it later in life Move in
with a couple best male friends and
live it up Now’s the time

AARON

gallery downtown Advertise the

guerrilla marketing stuff We’1l

Aaron’s relentless positivity is starting to grate

DAPHNE

The point isn’t the show Aaron
It’s not that easy Trying to do
something creative is just
different than what you do It’s
not a linear process No offense

(then)
I’m sorry I know I’m being
difficult and a bitch about all
this stuff

AARON
You’re not being a bitch

DAPHNE
I was being a bitch You can be
mad at me

AARON
I’m not mad at you

DAPHNE
I love that you’re nice You’re
the first nice guy I’ve ever dated
and I love that about you But
when I’m being a bitch and you
don’t say I’m being a bitch you’re
keeping a part of yourself closed
off from me Feel free to be
honest and tell me when you’re
annoyed at me

AARON
I’m being totally honest That’s
what I love about us I can always
be honest You couldn’t ever annoy
me You’re too perfect
Daphne smiles at this
AARON (CONTD)
And as for getting your career off

what needs doing That’s how I get

closer and closer to the scary looking British security
services NOTE This whole fight is done in angry whispers

ALDOUS
(whispering intensely)
I said shove this up your bum now

AARON
What is that

ALDOUS
(whispering intensely)
It’s heroin what do you think it
is

Aldous grabs Aaron’s pants and starts to try to shove the
heroin down his pants Aaron tries to get away The
Security looks over to see what the commotion is about

ALDOUS (CONTD)
(whispering intensely)
Stop acting all mental and let me
shove this heroin up your ass
already I thought you used to run
heroin all the time

AARON
(whispering intensely
back)
I did it’s just been like eight
years so I’m not exactly

ALDOUS
(whispering intensely)
Shove it up your ass or I throw a
bloody fit and we’re both sent to
Guantanamo to be assraped by bin
Laden

They’re almost at the head of the line Aaron sees his life
flashing before his eyes He grabs the balloon and shoves it
down the back of his pants

ALDOUS (CONTD)
(whispering intensely)
Not so hasty

Aldous pulls a tube of KY Jelly out of his manpurse and
spritzes it on the balloon in Aaron’s hand Aaron shoves the
balloon down his pants grimaces and shoves it up his ass

He removes his hand

ALDOUS (CONTD)

first nice boyfriend like I’m
missing testicles or something but

But I shouldn’t And besides I
don’t want to either at all She’s
a hot doctor I didn’t think they
existed

ALDOUS
You’ve got to get it out of your
system Otherwise it’s going to
emerge like a noxious shit bubble
years from now when you have a
little baby daughter Do you want
to break your baby daughter’s
heart

AARON
No I don’t

ALDOUS
Then go out there and fuck that
girl It’s the morally correct
thing to do

Aldous starts to pee in the toilet

ALDOUS (CONTD)
Man I had to pee the entire time we
were having sex Isn’t that the
worst As I came I was literally
thinking about Victoria Falls

Aaron walks out of the bathroom back to the balcony Aldous

carefully inspects his hair in the mirror He sees one gray
hair He carefully PLUCKS it out

EXT BELLAGIO SUITE - BALCONY - NIGHT

Aaron rejoins Krissy on the balcony and hands her the joint
Krissy takes it and puffs it

KRISSY
Woh What is that

AARON

Something called the Jeffrey

(then)
If we do what I think we’re going
to do it’s important that I tell
you once more that I have a
girlfriend and shouldn’t be doing
this at all In fact I’m sorry I
even suggested we do anything
This is clearly a highly
inappropriate situation and I
regret having offended andor
dishonored you in any way

KRISSY
You’re cute

Krissy grabs Aaron and kisses him hard

INT BELLAGIO SUITE - GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

They fall into a bed Krissy’s “nice” shtick suddenly drop
and she becomes a voraciously sexual

KRISSY
Man you are a hot You look like
Dennis Quaid

AARON
Really I never thought of myself--

Krissy tears off Aaron’s pants

AARON (CONTD)
Woh I’m not sure about this --

KRISSY
Get sure Pump me

Krissy removes her shirt and puts Aaron’s hands on her boobs

AARON
Wow these are really hard

KRISSY
Silicone can get into your
bloodstream and fuck your shit up

She goes down on Aaron We can’t tell what she’s doing

AARON

What is that What are you doing
I’m not sure but I think I love
what is currently happening to me
Why can’t I stop narrating what is
happening to me while it’s
happening --

(then noticing something

below frame)
Wow your pubic hair is in the
shape of a lightning bolt

INT BELLAGIO SUITE - MASTER BEDROOM

JONATHAN SNOW

ALDOUS
Youre just nervous that you
screwed that girl Normal stress
coming out

AARON
I didn’t cheat on her I didn’t
even put it in It just kind of
circled the area My heart
literally won’t stop pounding

ALDOUS
That is the most amazing expression
ever

Aldous takes out his camera phone and takes a photo of Aaron
Aaron spazzily takes a drag off the joint

AARON
I’m totally having a heart attack

JONATHAN SNOW
Well then I wouldn’t suck on that

AARON
Why It’s just a joint

ALDOUS
No it’s a Jeffrey

AARON
Wait what’s in this thing

ALDOUS
A layer of pot Then a layer of
opium Then some crack Anda
little bit o meth And the rolling
paper’s been dipped in acid Oh
and there also might be some angel
dust Not sure

AARON
Why the fuck is it called Jeffrey

JONATHAN SNOW
Cause who could be scared of
Jeffrey Jeffrey’s just a nice
bloke from down the road

AARON
I am having a heart attack

ALDOUS
No you’re not

JONATHAN SNOW
He could be The Jeffrey gives
people in much better shape heart
attacks I knew this footballer
who had a heart attack who had just
like one puff of the Jeffrey and
unlike Jewfro he had zero percent
body fat

ALDOUS
Don’t freak him out more

JONATHAN SNOW
I’m just truth telling

ALDOUS
Oh like the way you truth-telled
about my relationship with Jackie

JONATHAN SNOW
I had to get my side of the story
across

ALDOUS
You ain’t got no side

JONATHAN SNOW
You were a bastard as a kid and
youre a bastard now

ALDOUS
Maybe I wouldn’t have been a
bastard if you hadn’t left me and
mum at home to fuck underage Thai
hookers

JONATHAN SNOW
You’re the one to talk

ALDOUS
You made me this way You made me
incapable of connecting with people
except by having sex with them

Aldous PUNCHES his dad Aldous and his Dad get into a
vicious fist fight

Aldous picks up an ant crawling on the table

ALDOUS (CONTD)
It’s beautiful isn’t it

Aaron looks at it and starts to calm down Aldous SNORTS IT

AARON

Ah Why would you do that
ALDOUS

To distract you And impress you
AARON

My heart’s definitely stopped

(then)
I have to run to keep it beating

Aaron takes off around the room and then passes out He
wakes up briefly to see Jonathan peeing on the floor
INT BELLAGIO SUITE - BALCONY - DAWN

Your dad doesn’t have pancreatic
cancer does he

ALDOUS
It’s in remission

AARON
No it isn’t I don’t care

ALDOUS
You’re right I lied Like the
way you lied about doing drugs

AARON
I’ve smoked pot

ALDOUS
That’s not drugs

AARON
It’s actually gotten a lot stronger
recently The THC levels are like
way higher than when our parents
smoked it you’re right It’s
not drugs

ALDOUS
(then)
I don’t understand you Why’d you
stop having sex with that girl
She was proper smoking

AARON
Because of my girlfriend

ALDOUS
I just don’t get that

AARON
What’s there to get

ALDOUS
Why are you in a relationship
What is the advantage of it

AARON
I don’t like choosing stuff like
where I have to go to dinner Or
my clothes I like that my outfits
get laid out for me I wake up
every morning and my shirt is
picked out for me my jeans are
picked out for me it’s nice

ALDOUS
Youre fascinating What do you
do Like at night

AARON
I don’t know I watch TV Like
Grey’s Anatomy

ALDOUS
Is that with that guy McDreamy
AARON
Yeah
ALDOUS
I know him I fucked him
AARON
No way
ALDOUS

I was in a bad way Id just

broken up with Kelly Osborne I

know that bloke We had sex
(awkward silence)

What do you do for your birthday

This is just fascinating I’ve

never met anyone like you

AARON
Last year my family and Daphne’s
family had dinner and went to see
Capote How about you What’d you
do for your birthday

ALDOUS
Me and about ninety-five people
went to Richard Branson’s private
island and had an ecstasy party and
then went out in a hot air balloon

AARON
I’m not going to lie Your life
seems awesome

ALDOUS
But it’s missing love Aaron
Don’t you see I want love the way
you have love Without love I’m
gonna become that bastard we just
spent twelve hours with I want a
lady to pick out my clothes And
not just an assistant who I pay

Beat

AARON
Is there a specific someone

ALDOUS
I’m in love with Jackie Q I know
it now She’s so gorgeous and sexy
and has these perfect tits
Really something Like an angel’s
tits And she always kept me
guessing I was with her at this
party in Monaco and she leans over
and whispers to me “I’m wet” She
just said that to me you know
like she was telling me the
weather with McCartney and Judi
Dench and the Dalai Lama just
standing like two feet away I
swear I fell in love right then
right there Then later that week
were at a nightclub in Goa and she
went and made out with Emma Bunton
right in front of me Under
different circumstances I would
have been happy to be seeing this
this would have been my idea of
nirvana But not this time This
time I was mad And as I watched
them make out and strip and begin
the process of engaging in oral sex
I got angrier and angrier till I
realized this was love I was in
love

ALDOUS (CONT’D)
We have a kid together you know
I haven’t seen the tyke in years
Beautiful child

AARON
That’s amazing man That’s the
reason we’re here on Earth

ALDOUS
It is isn’t it I even pay his
child support but I don’t mind
cause I love him so much And her
too

AARON
Whyd it end

ALDOUS
I don’t know I just don’t I
want her back She lives in LA and
I want to see her and get her back
But I don’t know what to do Like
when I first see her what do I do

AARON
Just be honest and tell her how you
feel A good relationship if
that’s what you want is all about
honesty The one thing is and I
don’t want to get into this if it
doesn’t matter but isn’t she
engaged to Paul Allen

ALDOUS

(turning dark)
You’re right if I’m honest I’1l
get her And once I’ve gotten her
I can finally put an end to this
interminable miserable single
life Presently I can go wherever
I want with whoever I want and do
whatever I want to whomever I want
It’s not as good as eating dinner
at 630 with the same person and
having nothing new to talk about
ever It’s like when I was on
Branson’s private island in an
ecstasy orgy with these two Indian
models I was like “I wish I was
locked in a small apartment in Los
Angeles with the same person
forever”

Aaron’s unsure whether to be offended or laugh it off

ALDOUS (CONTD)
I’m just joshing with you man
I’m jealous

AARON
Oh you

Aaron playfully pushes Aldous Aldous playfully pushes Aaron
back Aaron playfully pushes Aldous back IN ONE LIGHTNING
QUICK MOVE Aldous unlatches the car door on Aaron’s side and
PUSHES AARON OUT THE DOOR We see in one shot no cuts as
Aaron flies out the door and tumbles behind the car onto the
highway Cars swerve around his body In the receding
background we see Aaron JUMP UP and dive away from two cars
that SMASH into each other

A DRIVER of one of the cars HOPS OUT and PUNCHES Aaron in the
face Aldous casually hits the divider button in the limo

ALDOUS
It seems my compatriot has fallen
out of the vehicle

The Limo Driver looks in the rear window and SCREECHES to the
side of the highway

EXT HIGHWAY

Aaron stands about a hundred yards from the limo

INT SUV LIMO

Aaron sits as far from Aldous as possible completely and
totally terrified

ALDOUS
It was just a joke I didn’t
realize you’d take it this
personally

AARON

some shut eye

Aaron closes his eyes He leaves them a little open so he
can keep an eye on Aldous

What do you do when you’re in a

other
ALDOUS
Aren’t you worried that you’re
missing out

ALDOUS
Threesome Do you have any
fantasies like that

AARON
I was just joking

DAPHNE
Id love to try a threesome You
know before I die

ALDOUS
Well that is something that is
possible right now It’s not like
wanting to fly or shoot lasers out
of your eyes A threesome is
something that we can accomplish
right here right now

AARON
That would be hilarious us having
a threesome

DAPHNE
We should do it

ALDOUS
If you’d like but I certainly
don’t want to apply any pressure
I have had my share of threesomes

DAPHNE
Cmon let’s do a threesome
Wouldn’t that be fun

AARON
I was speaking completely
theoretically I’m not actually
sure whether we should really be
having a threesome in reality

DAPHNE
You just said it’s something that
youd like to try

AARON
Well I mean it is

DAPHNE
So why not try it If we don’t
like it we don’t have to do it
again

ALDOUS
I got this mate who I had a
threesome with and he didn’t like
it and then he never had one again

Daphne looks at Aaron like “see”

DAPHNE
I mean unless you’re scared

AARON
I’m not scared I was just worried
that you might be scared I didn’t
want to press you into anything

DAPHNE
You aren’t

AARON
If you’re not scared

DAPHNE
I’m not scared

AARON
Then neither am I

having sex with Daphne’s face Or at least that’s what we
have to assume All the drive drops out of Aaron

AARON
Hey guys Where do you want me to
put your water

DAPHNE
C’mon baby get involved

Aaron awkwardly tries to get into the action

ALDOUS
Oh boy Oh boy Oh boy I am
going to ejaculate again

see Aaron’s face change

AARON
What the fuck

ALDOUS
What’s the problem

AARON
You got it on me man

Aaron is frozen in terrordisgust

ALDOUS
I didn’t mean to That was an
unintentional sperming

DAPHNE

thing is going to happen in this
sort of situation

ALDOUS
I am starving I understand
there’s a delicious diner around
the corner You interested mate

AARON
Nahhh I’m good mate I think I’d
rather stay here then watch you eat
pancakes after you’ve had sex with
every part of my girlfriend and
then jizzed on my leg now GET THE
FUCK OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW

DAPHNE
Hey Aaron let’s talk about this

AARON
I don’t want to talk about this
while he’s here And once he’s not
here this is nothing we can talk
about This cannot be solved
through discussion This is you
cheating right in front of me

ALDOUS
I don’t think it’s cheating when
it’s a consensual threesome

DAPHNE
I thought you were cool with the
whole threesome thing

AARON
That wasn’t a threesome That was
a twosome with me watching

ALDOUS
You could have jumped in We
weren’t being exclusionary That’s
against the rules

AARON
This isn’t about rules or not
rules This is about you fucking
her right in front of me And why
are you in this conversation Why
are you even here

Aldous leaves the room

DAPHNE
I’m sorry Aaron I didn’t mean for
this happen

AARON
You were the one who said you’d be
into a threesome

DAPHNE
After you said it If you didn’t
want to why weren’t you honest
about that I would’ve said no if
you didn’t want to do it

AARON
I shouldn’t have to say anything to
get you to not have sex with
another man

ALDOUS
Sexual mores are just a thing of
the past century We are all
living in a false construct

AARON
GET OUT

Aldous leaves again

AARON (CONTD)
How could this happen Our life
was just going along at a great
awesome clip Why

DAPHNE
I don’t know

Daphne and Aaron both start to tear up

AARON
I want you to hug me even though
you were having sex with a
different guy like two minutes ago
What is wrong with me

DAPHNE
I want to hug you too It’s OK

Daphne and Aaron hug

AARON
Why am I letting you do this Get
away from me you you whore

Neither Aaron nor Daphne can believe he just called her a
whore

DAPHNE
I’m gonna go

Daphne goes He notices that Aldous’s black manpurse is
still in the apartment He picks it up and it spills opens
revealing a box of needles Aldous walks in

ALDOUS
I forgot my satchel

AARON
Youre jealous of my piddly life so
you destroy it

Aaron takes a needle out of the box and TOSSES IT at Aldous

ALDOUS
Woh Alright mate Let’s just
hand them over

AARON
Congrats Destruction complete

Aaron throws a second needle like a dart and NAILS Aldous in
the arm

ALDOUS
Ow

Aaron throws a third and fourth and fifth They land in
Aldous’s leg chest and right below his eye

ALDOUS (CONT’D)
What the hell man

Aldous pulls the needle out of his face and tosses it back
sticking Aaron in the arm

AARON
Hey watch it

ALDOUS
You’ve been throwing them

AARON
Yeah but that one was in you Now
I’ve got whatever blood diseases
you’ve got

Aldous takes another and throws it at Aaron Suddenly they
are in a FULL SCALE NEEDLE FIGHT tossing needles back and
forth with frighteningly fast abandon

ALDOUS
Draw Draw

They stop Aldous throws another needle at Aaron The
needle fight starts again While throwing needles they say
the following things --

ALDOUS (CONTD)
Don’t you get it I’m done The
only person that ever loved me
hates me I’m done making music
I’m done I might as well go kill
myself

AARON
Fine Go ahead you big baby
Kill yourself You just fucked my
girlfriend and then she dumped me
I don’t give a shit what you do
And make sure to swallow all the
pills If you swallow only half
you just get sleepy Better yet
shoot yourself but make sure to do
it in the head That way you’1l
have the best shot at actually
succeeding in killing yourself

disappointment I hope to one day
make it up to you

Aaron watches television depressed The phone rings

DAPHNE
Hey Aaron it’s Daphne We should
probably talk about what just
happened I’m at my parent’s
house Please call I love you
Like a lot I’m sorry

She starts to cry and hangs up The phone rings again He
lets it go to answering machine

SERGIO
Where the fuck are you guys He
was supposed to be here --

Aaron pulls the phone cord from the wall and throws it
against the wall A piece of the phone hits Aaron in the
head Aaron goes into the bathroom On the mirror there’s a
note He opens the envelope The note reads

ALDOUS (VO)
Dear Aaron This is my last will
and testament Since I have no
kids or wife or really anything I’m
leaving my estate to you If you
want to see me off I’1l be jumping
from the Hollywood sign at nine
depending on traffic I want my
body to be cryogenically frozen to
be unfrozen when there’s a chemical
cure for addiction or heroin
becomes legal whichever comes
first Yours Aldous PS I’m
sorry for making love to your
girlfriend That was done out of
self-anger PPS I do not know
if this last will and testament
will hold up in a court of law I
apologize if it doesn’t In fact
the more I think about it the more
unlikely it seems that it will
Sorry mate

The people on the tour bus laugh

AARON

TOUR BUS DRIVER

EXT HOLLYWOOD SIGN - CONTINUOUS

Aaron is now down at the Hollywood sign He sees Aldous
standing on top of the “H”

AARON
Hey asshole don’t jump

Aaron crawls down to the sign

ALDOUS
Why not I’ve got nothing I’ma
drug addicted nothing My friends
are all addicts or yes men I
can’t even write music anymore
I’m not even sure if I even ever
could Most of my songs are just
ripoffs of the Beatles and the
Clash I’m the nugget of shit that
hangs off the asshair of humanity

AARON
No you aren’t You can have sex
with whoever you want whenever you

want

ALDOUS
Sex isn’t love Sex has gotten
boring

(MORE )

ALDOUS (CONTD)
All I live for is getting high If
I don’t die from this Ill die from
an overdose At least if I jump
I’m making the choice not the
drink and the drugs

AARON
Jumping’s for pussies Jumping is
what you do out of fear You
really going to be a pussy You
really going to throw away the one
thing God has given us life for
nothing

ALDOUS
I didn’t know you were religious

AARON
I didn’t know it either until right
now but I think I am and I think
what you’re doing is downright
immoral In my one week with you
I’ve seen more of the world then I
have in my entire twenty three
years Don’t throw it all away
man Life is precious Don’t just
toss it away like a used needle
Instead take that needle and shoot
up life instead

ALDOUS
Why’re you doing this Do you love
me

AARON
No I don’t love you I kind of
hate you

ALDOUS

Tell me you love me

AARON
I love you in the way one is
required to love all humanity

ALDOUS
Tell me that you love me and me
specifically not just the general
concept of humanity

Beat Aldous moves to the edge of the “H”

AARON
I love you and you specifically
not just the general concept of
humanity I love you Aldous Snow
I love you

ALDOUS
I love you too Aaron Greenberg I
love you too

Aldous taking an intentional Christ like pose JUMPS off the
“H” and hits the dusty desert below with a resounding and
sickening thud He rolls down the hill

AARON
Fuck you

Aaron SCRAMBLES down the hill after Aldous

EXT BOTTOM OF THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN

Aldous rolls down the hill crashing through a fence and --

EXT HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE POOL AND HOT TUB

-- into a Hills house backyard splashing right into a hot
tub Aaron jumps down and sees Aldous floating in the hot
tub

FULL SCREEN CHYRON MINUS TWO HOURS SINCE THE CONCERT AT THE
GREEK WAS SUPPOSED TO START

AARON
Fuck you man Fuck you

Aaron jumps into the hot tub and flips Aldous over

AARON (CONTD)
Aldous Aldy Aldous Mr Snow

He pokes the body No movement He starts performing CPR on
Aldous gingerly breathing into Aldous’s mouth and pumping
his chest Soon his CPR gets more and more vigorous

AARON (CONTD)

(with each pump)
Fuck You Fuck You You
Are A Dick I Hope This
Doesn’t Work Why Do I
Have Mor Als

Aldous comes to and sucks in a breath As Aldous and Aaron
talk the hot tub slowly turns red with Aldous’s blood

ALDOUS
I’m alive I’m alive I can’t
believe I’m alive You saved me
Aaron I can’t believe you came
and saved me

AARON
I only came because I didn’t want
your death on conscience I
thought that maybe I’d go to jail
if I didn’t show up

ALDOUS
I have completely changed as a
result of the love you’ve given me
by saving me

AARON
As soon as you see a girl with big
tits or a pound of hashish it’1l
start all over again

ALDOUS
(starting to cry)
I look at you Aaron and I see
pure love You are the most
beautiful person I have ever met

AARON
I’m an enabler who is probably
responsible for the fact that you
have learned nothing and will be
smoking crack within the next
fifteen minutes

ALDOUS
I am going to prove you wrong
That’s how I feel about you
Because we are going to be best
friends forever

AARON
I won’t because you fucked my
girlfriend and screwed me out of my
job

ALDOUS
We can still make it

AARON
It’s over man The show was
supposed to start almost three
hours ago

ALDOUS

I’m always at least four hours
late My fans all know this
Once in Manchester I went on at
210AM Performed for six hours
We can still make it

(as they start to get out

of the tub)
My arm hurts

Aaron looks at Aldous’s arm The bone’s sticking through
Aaron THROWS UP on Aldous

INT AARON’S CAR
Aaron’s frantically driving Aldous

AARON
Are you sure we shouldn’t go to the
emergency room

ALDOUS
It’s just pain Pain is fleeting
Love is forever You have given me
love so in turn I shall give you
sobriety From now on nothing’s
more important to me than my
sobriety

Aldous opens up his manpurse and downs a bunch of pain pills

AARON
That’s the quickest trip to
hypocrisy maybe in history

ALDOUS
There is literally no way I can
save your job right now without
fourteen Vicodin My bone is
sticking out here Touch it
That’s bone

AARON
Please stop referencing your bone

Aldous touches his bone

ALDOUS
It’s so weird You can’t feel your
bone if you touch it It’s like
touching a drumstick or something

Aaron gags

EXT GREEK THEATER - ENTRANCE

Aaron and Aldous pull up the driveway to the Greek past a
giant sign that says “Aldous Snow -- LIVE FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN THREE YEARS” We hear booing from the auditorium

EXT GREEK THEATER - BACKSTAGE

ALDOUS

from jumping off the Hollywood
sign at least showed up Even
after I made love to his
girlfriend Now that’s true
friendship

The crowd doesn’t know how to respond to this
ALDOUS (CONTD)
I also wish to make an
announcement I’m quitting drugs
and the alcohol

The audience starts booing

The crowd

ALDOUS (CONTD)
If anyone ever sees me drinking a
beer or smoking a joint or doing
any other kind of controlled
substance you have my legal
permission to beat the living shit
out of me

The crowd cheers like crazy

ALDOUS (CONT’D)
And a one A two A one two

ALDOUS (CONT’D)
Check out my bone Check it out
Ahhh The pain

The band stops playing

ALDOUS (CONTD)
What’re you doing Keep playing

They start playing again Aldous begins singing and howling
in pain all at once

ALDOUS (CONTD)
(singing)
Love explosion Its a love
explosion My love explodes into
your heart It explodes all over
your chest

It’s awesome The crowd goes crazy Aldous begins jumping
up and down and then PASSES OUT on the stage In a moment of
odd enthusiasm Aaron grabs the microphone and motions for
the band to start playing Aaron continues the song

AARON
(singing)
My love explodes all over the
Earth My loves explodes across
the universe

The crowd BOOS

AARON (CONTD)
Well fuck you all too

Aaron starts proudly parading around the stage flipping them
off as medics rush onstage to take care of Aldous Aaron
rushes over to Aldous Aldous’s eyes flutter open

ALDOUS
Get your lady back man Youre
too much of a pussy to live in this
world without her

EXT DAPHNE’S PARENTS HOUSE - NIGHT

Aaron pulls up to Daphne’s parents’ house It’s a nice house
on the ocean in Laguna He runs up to the door Not wanting
to wake anyone up he knocks lightly on the door Then he
finally hits the doorbell A very long door chime version of
“Lollipop” plays Mr Binks opens the door

MR BINKS
What the hell time is it

AARON
Five am Is Daphne here

MR BINKS
I don’t think she wants to see you

AARON
Respectfully sir I don’t care
what you think

Aaron PUSHES past Mr Binks and into the house

INT DAPHNE’S PARENTS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Aaron heads into the Great Room

AARON
Daphne Daphne

Daphne and her mom come to the head of the stairs Aaron and
Daphne have this entire conversation in front of her parents

DAPHNE
Aaron What’re you doing here

AARON
I’m sorry I called you a whore

DAPHNE
I deserved it

AARON
No one deserves to be called a
whore Not even an actual whore
I want to get back together

DAPHNE
I do too Desperately

AARON
But only if you promise never to
have sex with another man in front
of me

DAPHNE
I wont

AARON
And one other thing I do
understand what it takes to be a
creative type And when you say I
dont its condescending and bitchy
and I don’t like it at all and
rather than whining about whether
your sculptures will or won’t sell
or whether people will or won’t
like them you should just get a
fucking gallery and show them
already

As the sun rises through the windows of their Great Room
Daphne tears down the stairs --

DAPHNE
I love you when you’re honest

-- and kisses him

AARON
While I was watching him there was
nothing he was doing that I
couldn’t physically do -- except
for that one thing on the floor I
just wouldn’t have the courage to
ask you

DAPHNE
You don’t have to do every thing
Aldous did But maybe one of the
twelve things

AARON
Great So let’s go do this --

DAPHNE
I can’t do it now I have some
kind of infection down there I
hate that fucking guy It stings
so bad

AARON
I’m so sorry baby

Aaron hugs Daphne
MRS BINKS
(oddly touched)

Awww

AARON
So when should we do this

DAPHNE
I can have sex again in three
weeks

AARON

Three weeks is a long time from
now It’ll give me time to prepare
mentally

INT AARON AND DAPHNE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Aaron PULLS OUT his Dustbuster

EXT AARON AND DAPHNE’S APARTMENT

of delight

EXT YOSEMITE - DAY

Aaron Aldous and Naples are hiking As they hike Aldous is
sucking down a sucrose gel pack

ALDOUS
I’m just incredibly grounded these
days Eight months clean

AARON
That’s really great I’m
impressed And it’s so great to
see that you’ve reconnected with
your son

NAPLES

ALDOUS
He’s just my mate His dad’s
actually Hugh Grant Who knew
He’s staying with me for the month
His mother’s kind of a W-H-O-R-E

He sucks down another gel pack

ALDOUS (CONT’D)

The point is I’m finally living the
clean life we’re all meant to live
and it’s all because of you Thank
you Aaron for pulling me back
from the edge and showing me the
way towards a healthy safe
existence

PULL BACK TO REVEAL they’re at the edge of a cliff

AARON

NAPLES
Kind of

FADE OUT

OVER CREDITS

We see the youtube clip from the beginning Aldous is
punching himself in the face It’s horrific Then he
reaches into his mouth and pulls out tooth after tooth
whipping each one at the audience
