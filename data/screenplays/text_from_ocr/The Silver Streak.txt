INT THE BAGGAGE CAR - NIGHT 16

In a SERIES of QUICK SHOTS and violent SWISH PANS we are
hurled into the midst of a violent scuffle Someone is being
beaten up in the baggage car but because of the dim light
the trunks and boxes and the incessant clattering of the
wheels we cannot recognize exactly what is going on We do
sense however that it is three men against one and when
finally the victim collapses on the floor we do manage to get
a full face CLOSEUP of the chief assailant REACE He is a
hulking giant of a man with an ugly prizefighters face He
deans over the lifeless body as we hear the other two men
speaking in the bg

We hear the others exit as the pug happily rubs his knuckles
and smiles -- exhibiting a full mouth of solid GOLD TEETH

INT THE DINER - NIGHT 17

The dining car is practically empty A few remaining guests
are paying thetr checks and the waiters are clearing the
tables But Hilly and George are oblivious to everything
except each other An empty half-bottle of champagne stands
on the table and both of them are relaxed and pleasantly
feeling its effect Hilly is finishing a funny story ard is
laughing at herself

staggers back into the room He turns to see a large ugly
MEXICAN LADY in her nightshirt kneeling on her bed saying
her prayers She takes one look at George and in violent
Spanish begins panic praying to ward off the oncoming rape

MEXICAN LADY
Ah rapeSanta Marial

George freaks and bowing and mumbling apologies hurriedly
exits to the safety of the corridor closing the door behind
him He pauses for a moment to regain his composure burps
and then starts off again Immediately the second Fat Man
exits from his compartment and makes his way toward George
George sighs but not wishing to go through the whole scene
again he backs up past the Mexican Ladys door and knocks on
the next door down He opens it steps inside for a second
to let the Fat Man pass then turns to the occupant He is a
very distinguished gentleman suavely attired who looks up
from the papers he has been reading This 1s ROGER DEVEREAU

GEORGE
Excuse me

Not waiting for a response George smiles and quickly closes
the door He continues on down the corridor

have been turned into beds George looks around and smiles

GEORGE
This 1s very nice

Hilly is lying on her bed with her shoes off She sniles as
she puts a tape into her portable cassette player and we
HEAR the lilting love song known as Hillys Theme George
takes off his coat and tie

GEORGE

GEORGE
You juggle a lot

nocently He grins and they begin chuckling with an easy fun-
filled sensuality George offers her a glass of champagne

She goes back to kissing his chest and begins working her way
down toward his navel

HILLY
Well then what would happen if you
treated an azalea like a nasturtium

George glances at the window -- and freezes
NEW ANGLE - SHOCK CUT 22

Out the window the dead body of a man suddenly slams into
FRAME He dangles grotesquely held up by his coat caught

on a protruding bolt George gasps The train WHISTLE
SCREAMS

We see clearly the face of the dead man -- an older gentleman
with a white moustache and goatee He has been beaten and

shot in the head and the blood trickles down the side of his
face

George jumps off the bed knocking over the cassette player
The body sways for another second then falls away The
WHISTLE stops and all is still once more

Hilly has seen nothing but she looks up at George staring
transfixed at the empty window

look back down the tracks

cassette recorder which stopped playing when George knocked
it over and looks around for a place where it will be safe
She starts the music (Hillys Theme) and puts it on a high
overhanging rack near the window

Boy if thats what the Dfs are

EXT THE SILVER STREAK - SUNRISE a4

We DISSOLVE from the rattling night wheels of the Silver
Streak to a HIGH ANGLE SHOT of the desert sunrise

INT GEORGES COMPARTMENT - DAY 25

George looking brighteyed and happy exits from the bath-
room where he has washed and shaved He puts on a clean shirt
and hums to himself Willys Theme as he buttons it up
Hilly is lying in bed deep in a relaxed and contented sleep
George looks at his watch and picks up a train schedule to

see when they will arrive at the next station He puts the’
schedule in his back pocket sees the empty champagne bottle
and picks it up with fond remembrance of the lovemaking the
night before Then he remembers his vision of the dead man
and his expression changes- He steps to the window and ignor-
ing the desert in bloom stretches his neck to try to see the
roof Unsatisfied he steps to the next window folds up his

bed to make the couch and tries again to see the outside roof

of the train He finally gives this up looks at the boutle
and drops it into the wastebasket He goes over to Hilly and
smiles down at her

Leaning forward to gently touch her hair he knocks the
Rembrandt book off the chair He picks it up and notices an
envelope stuffed with papers sticking out from under the
jacket cover He pats the envelope back in place and is about
to put it down when he turns it over to look at the authors
picture on the back He gasps with surprise for the picture
of the grey-haired old man with the white goatee is the same
man he saw hanging dead outside the window The train lurches
and George staggers Turning quickly to Hilly he shakes her
awake

GEORGE

Good night George Youre a
wonderful gardener

George walks away from the bed and paces to his side of the
room He looks at the book again and throws it into his open
briefcase with such force that the lid closes over it He is
not sure what to do He looks at the window and finally makes
up his mind Taking his coat from his closet he puts it on
and exits

Look I dont know who you are
but

WHINEY

Hey Reace Get rid of this bum

George is suddenly grabbed from behind and pitched down

the corridor -Whiney slams the door shut George turns to
look at his unseen assailant It is the ugly pug with the
gold teeth

GEORGE
Wait a minute You cant do
that to me

Gold Teeth strides toward George shoves him up against the
side of the train and twists his arm up behind his back
George yells in pain and struggles manfully

GEORGE
Hey you big ox what the hell do
you think youre doing Hold it
Let me go

Gold Teeth doesnt say a word He just begins walking to the
end of the corridor forcing George to walk in front of him

INT THE CAR PLATFORM - DAY 30

Gold Teeth bangs the door at the end of the corridor anc it
opens He throws George into the corner and turns to the
side door of the train George stands rubbing his arm

He is really mad

GEORGE
Hey man youre in trouble I
mean it Big trouble Im
reporting you

Gold Teeth flings open the side door of the train and turns
to face George George looks at the door and his attitude
changes

GEORGE
All rightokayenough is
enoughLets forget the whole
thing

Gold Teeth is unmoved He lunges for George grabs him by
the collar and the seat of the pants and with no effort at
all pitches him right off the train

EXT THE DESERT - DAY 31

George flies through the air and lands on the sandy bank of
an empty riverbed He rolls and tumbles and finally comes to
a stop in a cloud of dust The train races past George
cant believe what happened He sits up shakes his head
and looks as the last carriage of the Silver Streak rattles
by

GEORGE
What the --

He stands up and feels himself He is not hurt He dusts
himself off and notices that the sleeve on his jacket has
been ripped He fingers it lovingly Then he begins to get
the full realization of what has happened He runs up to the
railway tracks and squints at the train racing off in the
distance He looks behind him and out across the flat desert
on either side There is no sign of life or civilization
anywhere

EORGE
Son-of-a-bitch

He kicks the gravel on the railway ties and begins walking
down the tracks after the Silver Streak

EXT A DESERT LONG SHOT - DAY 32
In the vast stretches of the lonely desert we see George --
a solitary speck in the wilderness following the railway
line beneath the sweltering sun

EXT THE DESERT - DAY 33

George his coat over his shoulder is walking along the side
of the railroad tracks muttering to himself about his fate
The beauty of the green sagebrush and the yellow wildflcwers
in bloom is completely escaping him A few cows are grazing
in the distance but George doesnt care He stops at the
sight of a cattle skull at his feet half buried in the sand

GEORGE
(bitterly)
Terrific

He shakes his head grits his teeth and continues walking
kicking the occasional cactus

EXT THE DESERT - DAY 3h

George has been walking for almost two hours The terrain
has changed -- red rock mesas and mountains on the horizon
George climbs up on one of the smaller mesas and shielding
his eyes from the sun peers off in all directions Suddenly
he sees something He looks again Off across the flat
plain is a farmhouse and a windmill a distant vision that
sits incongruously on the desert floor like a childrens
model left in a sandbox George squeals with delight jumps
down and begins running toward it as fast as he can

EXT THE FARMHOUSE - LONG SHOT - DAY 35

The farmhouse is a startling sight a clapboard oasis
sticking up in the middle of nowhere A dusty road leads to
what is essentially two buildings -- the main house built in
the Mexican adobe style and a large barn somewhat red that
looks like it was transported from South Carolina Between
them is a yard encircled by a corral a cow shed a chicken
coop and an outhouse made from a 1930s silver camper
trailer George runs INTO FRAME and down the road

EXT THE FARMYARD - DAY 36

George arrives at the farmyard and stops to catch his breath
He looks around at the pigsty the turkeys in the chicken
coop and the lazy-eyed dog who glances up disinterestedly
from his kennel He walks over to a 1950 Chevy parked by
the porch and is about to knock on the front door when he
hears the SOUND of spit-spit-spit coming from the cow shed
Ducking under the clothesline he goes to the cow shed door

INT THE COW SHED - DAY 37

RITA BABTREE a large self-reliant Southern lady in her late
sixties is seated on a stool milking one of the cows She
hears George enter but doesnt stop or turn around

RITA

She hands George the stool and bucket and slams the freezer
door

RITA
Put the milk in here and Ill meet
you outside in ten minutes

Rita exits George puts down the stool and sits beside
Harriet He places the bucket beneath her udder and
nervously rubs his hands together Then gingerly he
reaches out and takes a teat in each fist He begins to
squeeze and pull Nothing happens He tries again

Nothing Harriet stops her chewing and looks around George
smiles at her and tries harder This time one squirt spits
into the empty bucket George beams He tries again
Another short squirt Harriet grunts disgustedly George
stops and looks up at her

GEORGE
Okay Im a slow starterBut
what happened to Niagara Falls

EXT THE FARMYARD - DAY 38

Rita exits from the house wearing jodhpurs and a leather
jacket and carrying five large parcels tied up with string
She steps off the porch and is surprised to see George
sitting in the front seat of the Chevy reading something
while he waits for her

RITA
What are you doing Steve

GEORGE
Im looking at the schedule for
the Silver Streak

RITA
No no I mean what are you sitting
in We aint going in that

GEORGE

EXT THE BARN - DAY 39

Rita flings open the barn doors and George stands staring at
an old-fashioned twoseater biplane parked in the center of
the hangar-like barn

RITA
Put these packages in the backseat
with you and Ill get the wheel
blocks I only hope Pepe has filled
it with enough gas

REVISED - THE SILVER STREAK - 4976 28

INT THE BARN - DAY 4o

Rita walks off to the end of the barn and pushes open the
two large doors George eyes the plane like it was some
Smithsonian antique

GEORGE
Are we going to fly in this

RITA
Whats the matter -- you afraid

GEORGE
No no People keep asking that

I am not afraid of flying

RITA
Great ‘Cause it aint no fun
soaring with a turkey Like Jack
used to say -- you take some
greenhorn up do a few loop-the-
loops and suddenly you got yourself
an outhouse in the sky

(chuckling )
Oh that Jack He was something
special

Rita puts on her flying goggles and her white scarf and
climbs into the cockpit George finishes stacking the
packages in the backseat and climbs in behind her

RITA
Cmon Steve Hop to it I

GEORGE

(suddenly)
Two oclock

stammering

RITA

Albuquerque

GEORGE
Wait a minute

He takes out the train schedule and looks at it eagerly

GEORGE

RITA
I suppose so Ready Watch those
parcels Cont

Rita starts the engine George settles in the seat and
straps himself in still smiling at the good news

GEORGE
This is fabulous

Rita moves out
EXT THE FIELD - DAY AL

The plane is racing along the bumpy runway field picking up
speed with every bounce Rita has her goggles down and guns
the engine while her white scarf flaps in the wind George
is white-faced and terrified -- a direct contrast from tae
shot before He looks ahead at the approaching windmill and
tugs nervously at his seat belt and shoulder strap as the
plane jumps up and down like a pilious bird Finally with a
mighty effort Rita pulls back on the stick and the plane
surges into flight Up up it goes and to Georges wide-eyed
horror it misses by inches the top arm of the windmill Rita
is too happy to even notice She shouts back

RITA
They talk of the joy of sex
Steve but it dont last like the
fun of flying
EXT FLYING MONTAGE - DAY 42

panic She laughs with sinful glee

She chuckles some more and stares down at the flock
Obviously she is thinking of doing it again

EXT A ROAD - DAY 45

Roger Devereau the suave continental gentleman we glimpsed
earlier George is surprised to see her with Devereau and is
about to approach her when he notices that Devereau in
conversation pats her hand somewhat intimatelyGeorge

nearest table to watch her Sweet is at the table reading a
newspaper He puts it down and looks at George

I saw his body fall from the roof

thunderstruckand stares open-mouthedly at the trim healthy
elderly gentleman with the white moustache and goatee -- the

He goes to the door and steps into his room It is obvious
that he is upset and jealous over Devereaus interest in
Hilly but he feels that he has made such an ass out of hin-
self in front of both of them that he Just wants to get away

‘right away - i

He shuts the door Mr Whiney sits down on the couch and
bégins to snicker But Devereaus expression changes from
serenely confident to deeply troubled He turns to Hilly who
looks at him in her insouciant way Suddenly and viciously
he SLAPS her across the face

side and sees a great Rocky Mountain gorge several hundred
feet below Its obvious that there aint anything that
would get him to go walking on the top of this train Sweet
bends down and picks up something He looks around then
makes his way back to the ladder George climbs down and
waits for Sweet They both go into the baggage car and
close the door

INT THE BAGGAGE CAR - DAY 63

GEORGE
What did you find

Sweet hands George a piece of material that he found on the
train roof

SWEET
It was hooked on a protruding bolt

George fingers the piece of material It is obvious that
it came from the dead Professors jacket

GEORGE
Then I was right I did see him

SWEET
Ill bet Devereau has already had
the body picked up and placed in
cold storage somewhere Too bad
He was a sweet old guy

GEORGE
But why would Devereau want to
kill the Professor

Sweet takes the material and places it carefully in his
Wallet As he opens his jacket George notices he is
carrying a gun Sweet begins snooping around the baggage
car picking up various pieces of sports equipment He

seems to be looking for something or maybe just trying to
figure out how the Professor escaped He opens and closes
the large side door

SWEET
Devereau was going to be embarrassed
by the findings in his book Two
of the Institutes Rembrandts --
both bought and authenticated by
Devereau -- were going to be proved
as forgeries and the Professor had
the proof in his possession I
asked him what this proof was He
smiled cagily and told me Id have
to wait for his lecture

GEORGE
Devereau wasnt going to wait

SWEET
No Look heres Devereaus safe

Sweet kneels down to examine it but continues with his
story

SWEET
The idea I think was to kidnap then
kill the Professor substitute a
phony look-alike who would botch
the lecture and discredit the book

Sweet stands up apparently satisfied with his inspection of
the safe

SWEET
Weve got to find that proof

GEORGE
But they have it Thats what
Whiney and everyone was looking
for this morning -- the Rembrandt
letters They said they found
them in the Professors trunk

SWEET
They were lying That was the
first place they looked before they
began turning his room upside down
No the Professor hid them somewhere
- some place simplejust as a
precaution when he learned that
Devereau was on the train He had
no time to --

and opens his compartment door

INT GEORGES COMPARTMENT - DAY 65

George walks in followed by Sweet who closes the door George
quickly takes his briefcase from the chair opens it and
with a sigh of relief takes out the Professors book on
Rembrandt He throws down the briefcase and opens the jacket
cover of the book Very carefully he removes the envelope
and takes out the contents -- three pieces of old but strong
parchment paper covered in neat scribblings of black ink
George glances over them and offers them to Sweet with a
smile

GEORGE
The Rembrandt letters

Sweet takes them and sits down

SWEET
Holy Toledo I think youve found them
(looking through them)
The genuine article penned by the
old boy himself

GEORGE
(reading the signature)
Rembrandt van Rijn

SWEET

My guess is that there is some fact
some date in all of this that proves
the charges the Professor makes in
his book And that means bye-bye
Devereau

(folding them up)
Press the button for the porter I
want to get the conductor in here
and radio a message to the next town

George presses the signal for the porter He sits down and
puts the letters back in the envelope

killed over these

Theyre only the tip of the

Cologne was one of Devereaus
specials -- a hundred people
killed to cover up his involvement
in the Metropolitan Gallery scandal

GEORGE
Why wasnt he caught

SWEET
No proof But with those letters
weve got him His multimillion
dollar operation in art is going
to bust wide open and some
important people even several
governments are going to be
caught in the blast

GEORGE
Thats why she was so distant
They had her cornered but she
still tried not to get me involved

As George muses by the window Sweet paces back and forth

SWEET
Remember your necks on the line
too Youve already told them
you saw the real Professor shot

GEORGE
Yeah I did So what do we do
now

SWEET

You be responsible for Hilly
Just get her off the train and

How Here comes the tunnel

Sweet glances out the window as the entrance to the
Rayner Tunnel approaches

catch his breath He grins ruefully clutching his ches

afraid to try to escape that way

pounding at the door

and decides it would be a good idea to unlock the side door
a8 an avenue of emergency escape He opens the latches and
tries to pull the door back He tries again It opens with
a sudden jerk so unexpectedly that George trips backward and
knocks his gun off the trunk He gasps in horror as the gun
bounces on the floor and tumbles out the open door He
sticks his head out and looks back down the tracks All he
can see is the deep rocky mountain gorge running alongside
the traincertain death to anyone who would try to jump
off The POUNDING at the main door increases and George sees
the lock 1s beginning to Give He closes the side door and
faces inside He looks at his barricade at the trunks at
the smiling face of the cardboard Mary-Lou It is clear
he is scared and has no idea which way to turn

turns and quickly looks through the rest of the car even
pushing over the cardboard cut-out of Mary-Lou to see Lf he

stands up on the roof and looks about Realizing there is no
way for George to have gone forward toward the engine he
begins carefully walking back toward the rear As he hops
over the canvas covered space between the baggage car and the
first-class sleeper we see Georges head below him
fearfully watching clinging to the side of the train

spear gun from around his shoulder and is pointing it
directly at his pursuer ‘

GEORGE
Hold it Dont move or Ill shoot

Gold Teeth looks at the ridiculous spear gun and grins His
evil eyes glint menacingly He begins slowly to point his
gun at George George fires In a flash the spear flies
throughthe air and imbeds itself in Gold Teeths shoulder
Gold Teeth staggers in shock lurches over and falls His
body slides off the roof of the train and George watches
horrified as it tumbles down the gorge bouncing from rock
to rock till it disappears from sight

George stands on the roof stunned at what he has seen and
what he hasdone He looks at the spear gun in his hand

and viciously hurls it away He watches it fall and takes a
deep breath Remembering that Hilly is still in danger he
turns to walk back to the ladder Just then a low hanging
signal arm hits him in the stomach knocking him off balance
and swinging him off the roof He scrambles and holds on
hanging by his hands till the arm swings him all the way over
to the hillside Letting go he slides on his back down the
dirt embankment stopping by the railroad tracks Just as the
last car of the train speeds past George sits up and
watches 1t go with open-mouthed wonder and surprise

and muttering to himself It is getting cold and he turns
up his jacket collar To his right he sees a meadow a line
of trees and the distant mountains Suddenly above the line
of trees he sees a semi-trailer carrying a load of cars
They disappear George runs down the tracks and through a
break in the trees sees a main road A car passes Another
car with its headlights already on speeds by With a yell
of delight George races toward the meadow and scrambles up
the bank to the road where because of the frequent traffic
it is obvious he will be able to get a lift

cross us but I knew I couldnt kill
the professor himself until I had

I set up the scenario of kidnapping
him and substituting an imposter to
discredit him Of course I would
have had him killed later but his
escaping the other night upset the
entire scheme’

on the black’ market they are worth

a considerable sum At any rate
evidence willbe found on the professors
body implicating you Ive already
had that arranged Furthermore since
the police want you for the murder of
that unfortunate vitamin salesman -
this new evidence will give you a
motive for his death as well

tumbles down scrambling madly for balance Hilly screams

George maneuvers himself closer to the pin He looks down at
the speeding tracks and gathers his strength for one last
effort The muscles of his face are pulsating The veins of
his neck stand out All his bedy shivers with the strain
when suddenly the pin turns free The train lurches and the
cars pull apart ‘The hoses break and like a banshee
wailing the air pressure escapes and the brakes come on
Sparks fly from the wheels and piercing SCREECHES fill the
air as the wheels lock and slide along the track George
scrambles back up with the aid of Hilly and Grover Grabbing
onto the end of the car they watch the forward section of

engine plows through his stall crashes through the record
poutique and completely demolishes the glass Kodak booth

GEORGE
You know I look at the face of

They look around and see Grover over by the Dodge Dart with
his hands in the engine

HILLY
Whats he doing

GEORGE
I think hes just bagged himself
another pussey

Grover slams down the Dodge Dart hood and officiously
ordering people to get out of the way sits at the wheel and
begins to slowly drive off through the crowd He passes
George and Hilly and winks before he dissappears down a ramp
George shakes his head and smiles

GEORGE
