LEONARD (cont’d)
I had to see through people’s bullshit
It was useful experience because now
it’s my life When I meet someone I
don’t even know if I’ve met them before
I have to look in their eyes and just
figure them out My job taught me that
the best way to find out what someone
knew was to let them talk

hands Mrs Jankis rolls up her sleeve Leonard watches as
Sammy takes a SYRINGE and pushes the needle through the
rubber of the bottle The label is marked “INSULIN”

LEONARD (VO)(cont’d)
The crazy part was that this guy who
couldn’t follow the plot of “Green
Acres” could do the most complicated
things as long as he had learned them
before the accident

Sammy INVERTS the bottle and syringe DRAWS the insulin into
the syringe withdraws the needle holds it up to check for
bubbles TAPPING it delicately

LEONARD (V0) (CONTD)
- and as long as he kept his mind on
what he was doing

gently PINCHES the skin and confidently INSERTS the needle
Mrs Jankis winces

guy

LEONARD
Yeah well I go on facts not
recommendations okay

TEDDY
Lenny you can’t trust a man’s life to
your little notes and pictures

LEONARD
Why

TEDDY
Because you’re relying on them alone You
Don’t remember what you’ve discovered or
how Your notes might be unreliable

LEONARD
Memory’s unreliable

Teddy snorts

LEONARD (cont’d)
No really Memory’s not perfect It’s
not even that good Ask the police
eyewitness testimony is unreliable The
cops don’t catch a killer by sitting
around remembering stuff They collect
facts make notes draw conclusions
Facts not memories that’s how you
investigate I know it’s what I used to
do Memory can change the shape of a room
or the color of a car It’s an
interpretation not a record Memories
can be changed or distorted and they’re
irrelevant if you have the facts

TEDDY
You really want to find this guy

He took away the woman I love and he took
away my memory He destroyed everything
my life and my ability to live

Sammy was truly gone then I could say

As long as I have doubt I can’t say
goodbye and move on

TEDDY
Just some guy Does it even matter who I
stopped asking myself why a long time
ago No reason no conspiracy just bad
fucking luck A couple of junkies too
strung out to realize that your wife
didn’t live alone When you killed him
I’ve never seen you so happy — I was
convinced you’d remember But it didn’t
stick like nothing ever sticks Like
this won’t stick

MEMENTO MORI

Jonathan Nol an

What like a bullet can undeceive
—Herman Melville

Your Wfe always used to say youd be ate for your own funeral
Rerenber that Her little joke because you were such a sl ob-al ways
late always forgetting stuff even before the incident

Ri ght about now youre probably wondering if you were ate for hers

You were there you can be sure of that Thats what the pictures for—
the one tacked to the wall by the door Its not custonary to take
pictures at a funeral but somebody your doctors I guess knew you
woul dnt rernenber They had it blow up nice and big and stuck it right
there next to the door so you couldnt help but see it every tine you
got up to find out where she wes

The guy in the picture the one Wth the flowers Thats you And what
are you doing Youre reading the headstone trying to figure out whos
funeral youre at sane as youre reading it now trying to figure why
someone stuck that picture next to your door But wm bother reading
sonething that you wont renenber

Shes gone gone for good and you nust be hurting right now hearing
the news Believe ne I know how you feel Youre probably a weck But
give it five minutes maybe ten Maybe you can even go a Whole half
hour before you forget

But you W forget-t guarantee it A fewnore ninutes and youll be
heading for the door looking for her all over again breaking down
when you find the picture How nany times do you have to hear the nevus
before sone other part of your body other than that busted brain of
yours starts to renenber
Never-ending grief never-ending anger Useless Wthout direction
Maybe you cant understand whats happened Cant say I really
understand either Backwards anmesia Thats what the sign says CRS
disease Your guess is as good as nine

Maybe you cant understand what happened to you But you do renenber
what happened to HER dont you The doctors dont went to talk about
it They wont answer ny questions They dont think its right for a
man in your condition to hear about those things But you renenber
enough dont you You renenber his face

This is why Imwriting to you Futile maybe I dont know how nany
tines youll have to read this before you listen to me I dont even
know how ong youve been ocked up in this roomalready Neither do
you But your advantage in forgetting is that youll forget to wite
yourself off as a lost cause

Sooner or ater you want to do something about it And when you do
youll just have to trust ne because Imthe only one who can hel p
you

EARL OPENS ONE EYE after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles
interrupted by a hand-printed sign taped right above his head large
enough for him to read from the bed An alarm clock is ringing
somewhere He reads the sign blinksreads it again then takes a look
at the room

Its a white room overwhelmingly white from the walls and the
curtains to the institutional furniture and the bedspread The alarm
clock is ringing from the white desk under the window with the white
curtains At this point Earl probably notices that he is lying on top
of his white comforter He is already wearing a dressing gown and
slippers

He lies back and reads the sign taped to the ceiling again It says in
crude block capitals THIS IS YOUR ROOM THIS IS A ROOM IN A HOSPITAL
THIS IS WHERE YOU LIVE NOW

Earl rises and takes a look around The room is large for a hospital—
empty linoleum stretches out from the bed in three directions Two
doors and a window The view isnt very helpful either—a close of
trees in the center of a carefully manicured piece of turf that
terminates in a sliver of two-lane blacktop The trees except for the
evergreens are bare—early spring or late fall one or the other

Every inch of the desk is covered with Post-it notes legal pads
neatly printed lists psychological textbooks framed pictures On top
of the mess is a half-completed crossword puzzle The alarm clock is
riding a pile of folded newspapers Earl slaps the snooze button and
takes a cigarette from the pack taped to the sleeve of his dressing
gown He pats the empty pockets of his pajamas for a light He rifles
the papers on the desk looks quickly through the drawers Eventually
he finds a box of kitchen matches taped to the wall next to the window
Another sign is taped just above the box It says in loud yellow
letters CIGARETTE CHECK FOR LIT ONES FIRST STUPID

Earl laughs at the sign lights his cigarette and takes a long draw
Taped to the window in front of him is another piece of looseleaf paper
headed YOUR SCHEDULE

It charts off the hours every hour in blocks 1000 pm to 800 am
is labeled go BACK TO SLEEP Earl consults the alarm clock 815 Given
the light outside it must be morning He checks his watch 1030 He
presses the watch to his ear and listens He gives the watch a wind or
two and sets it to match the alarm clock

According to the schedule the entire block from 800 to 830 has been
labeled BRUSH YOUR TEETH Earl laughs again and walks over to the
bathroom

The bathroom window is open As he flaps his arms to keep warm he
notices the ashtray on the windowsill A cigarette is perched on the
ashtray burning steadily through a long finger of ash He frowns
extinguishes the old butt and replaces it with the new one

The toothbrush has already been treated to a smudge of white paste The
tap is of the push-button variety—a dose of water with each nudge Earl
pushes the brush into his cheek and fiddles it back and forth while he
opens the medicine cabinet The shelves are stocked with single-serving
packages of vitamins aspirin antidiuretics The mouthwash is also
single-serving about a shot-glass-worth of blue liquid in a sealed
plastic bottle Only the toothpaste is regular-sized Earl spits the
paste out of his mouth and replaces it with the mouthwash As he lays
the toothbrush next to the toothpaste he notices a tiny wedge of paper
pinched between the glass shelf and the steel backing of the medicine
cabinet He spits the frothy blue fluid into the sink and nudges for
some more water to rinse it down He closes the medicine cabinet and
smiles at his reflection in the mirror
Who needs half an hour to brush their teeth

The paper has been folded down to a minuscule size with all the
precision of a sixth-graders love note Earl unfolds it and smooths it
against the mirror It reads—

IF YOU CAN STILL READ THIS THEN YOURE A FUCKING COWARD

Earl stares blankly at the paper then reads it again He turns it
over On the back it reads—

PS AFTER YOUVE READ THIS HIDE IT AGAIN

Earl reads both sides again then folds the note back down to its
original size and tucks it underneath the toothpaste

Maybe then he notices the scar It begins just beneath the ear jagged
and thick and disappears abruptly into his hairline Earl turns his
head and stares out of the corner of his eye to follow the scars
progress He traces it with a fingertip then looks back down at the
cigarette burning in the ashtray A thought seizes him and he spins out
of the bathroom

He is caught at the door to his room one hand on the knob Two
pictures are taped to the wall by the door Earls attention is caught
first by the MRI a shiny black frame for four windows into someones
skull In marker the picture is labeled YOUR BRAIN Earl stares at it
Concentric circles in different colors He can make out the big orbs of
his eyes and behind these the twin lobes of his brain Smooth
wrinkles circles semicircles But right there in the middle of his
head circled in marker tunneled in from the back of his neck like a
maggot into an apricot is something different Deformed broken but
unmistakable A dark smudge the shape of a flower right there in the
middle of his brain

He bends to look at the other picture It is a photograph of a man
holding flowers standing over a fresh grave The man is bent over
reading the headstone For a moment this looks like a hall of mirrors
or the beginnings of a sketch of infinity the one man bent over
looking at the smaller man bent over reading the headstone Earl
looks at the picture for a long time Maybe he begins to cry Maybe he
just stares silently at the picture Eventually he makes his way back
to the bed flops down seals his eyes shut tries to sleep
The cigarette burns steadily away in the bathroom A circuit in the
alarm clock counts down from ten and it starts ringing again

Earl opens one eye after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles
interrupted by a hand-printed sign taped right above his head large
enough for him to read from the bed

You cant have a nornal life anynore You must know that How can you
have a girlfriend if you cant renenber her name Cant have kids not
unless you want themto grow up Wth a dad who doesnt recognize them
Sure as hell cant hold dow a job Not too nany professions out there
that value forgetfulness Prostitution naybe Politics of course

No Your life is over Youre a dead nan The only thing the doctors are
hoping to do is teach you to be ess of a burden to the orderlies And
they probably never let you go hore wherever that would be

So the question is not to be or not to be because you arent The
question is whether you went to do sonething about it Whether revenge
matters to you

It does to nost people For a few weeks they plot they schene they
take measures to get even But the passage of tine is all it takes to
erode that initial inpulse Tine is theft isnt that what they say
And tine eventually convinces nost of us that forgiveness is a virtue
Conveniently cowardice and forgiveness ook identical at a certain
distance Time steals your nerve

If tine and fear arent enough to dissuade people fromtheir revenge
then theres always authority softly shaking its head and saying Vé
understand but youre the better nan for letting it go For rising
above it For not sinking to their level And besides says authority
if you try anything stupid well lock you up ina little room

But they already put youina little room didnt they Oily they dont
really lock it or even guard it too carefully because youre a cripple
A corpse A vegetable who probably wouldnt renenber to eat or take a
shit if soreone wasnt there to renind you
And as for the passage of time well that doesnt really apply to you
anynore does it Just the sane ten minutes over and over again So
how can you forgive if you cant renenber to forget

You probably were the type to et it go werent you Before But
youre not the nan you used to be Not even half Youre a fraction
youre the ten-minute ran

Of course weakness is strong Its the prinary impulse Youd probably
prefer to sit in your little roomand cry Live in your finite
collection of menories carefully polishing each one Half a life set
behind glass and pinned to cardboard like a collection of exotic
insects Youd like to live behind that glass wouldnt you Preserved
in aspic

Youd like to but you cant can you You cant because of the last
addition to your collection The last thing you renenber Hs face Hs
face and your Wfe ooking to you for hel p

And naybe this is where you can retire to when its over Your little
collection They can lock you back up in another little roomand you
can live the rest of your life in the past But only if youve got a
little piece of paper in your hand that says you got him

You know Imright You know theres a lot of work to do It nay seem
inpossi ble but Imsure if we all do our part well figure sonething
out But you dont have nuch tine Youve only got about ten ninutes
in fact Then it starts all over again So do sonething wth the tine
youve got

EARL OPENS HIS EYES and blinks into the darkness The alarm clock is
ringing It says 320 and the moonlight streaming through the window
means it must be he early morning Earl fumbles for the lamp almost
knocking it over in the process Incandescent light fills the room
painting the metal furniture yellow the walls yellow the bedspread
too He lies back and looks up at the stretch of yellow ceiling tiles
above him interrupted by a handwritten sign taped to the ceiling He
reads the sign two maybe three times then blinks at the room around
him
It is a bare room Institutional maybe There is a desk over by the
window The desk is bare except for the blaring alarm clock Earl
probably notices at this point that he is fully clothed He even has
his shoes on under the sheets He extracts himself from the bed and
crosses to the desk Nothing in the room would suggest that anyone
lived there or ever had except for the odd scrap of tape stuck here
and there to the wall No pictures no books nothing Through the
window he can see a full moon shining on carefully manicured grass

Earl slaps the snooze button on the alarm clock and stares a moment at
the two keys taped to the back of his hand He picks at the tape while
he searches through the empty drawers In the left pocket of his
jacket he finds a roll of hundred-dollar bills and a letter sealed in
an envelope He checks the rest of the main room and the bathroom Bits
of tape cigarette butts Nothing else

Earl absentmindedly plays with the lump of scar tissue on his neck and
moves back toward the bed He lies back down and stares up at the
ceiling and the sign taped to it The sign reads GET UP GET OUT RIGHT
NOW THESE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO KILL YOU

Earl closes his eyes

They tried to teach you to nake lists in grade school renenber Back
when your day planner was the back of your hand And if your
assignnents cane off in the shower well then they didnt get done No
direction they said No discipline So they tried to get you to wite
it all dow sonemere nore pernanent

Of course your grade-school teachers would be laughing their pants wet
if they could see you now Because youve becone the exact product of
their organizational lessons Because you cant even take a piss
wthout consulting one of your lists

They were right Lists are the only wey out of this ness

Heres the truth People even regular people are never just any one
person Wth one set of attributes Its not that sinple Vére all at
the mercy of the linbic system clouds of electricity drifting through
the brain Every man iis broken into twenty-four-hour fractions and
then again wthin those twenty-four hours Its a daily pantomne one
nan yielding control to the next a backstage crowded Wth old hacks
clanoring for their turn in the spotlight Every week every day The
angry nan hands the baton over to the sulking nan and in turn to the
sex addict the introvert the conversationalist Every nanis a nob a
chain gang of idiots

This is the tragedy of life Because for a fewninutes of every day

every man becones a genius Monents of clarity insight whatever you
want to call them The clouds part the planets get ina neat little

line and everything becones obvious I should quit snoking naybe or
heres howl could nake a fast million or such and such is the key to
eternal happiness Thats the miserable truth For a few nonents the
secrets of the universe are opened to us Life is a cheap parlor trick

But then the genius the savant has to hand over the controls to the
next guy dom the pike nost likely the guy who just wents to eat
potato chips and insight and brilliance and salvation are all
entrusted to a moron or a hedonist or a narcoleptic

The only way out of this ness of course is to take steps to ensure
that you control the idiots that you becone To take your chain gang
hand in hand and lead them The best way to do this is Wtha list

Its like a letter you wite to yourself A naster plan drafted by the
guy who can see the light nade Wth steps sinple enough for the rest
of the idiots to understand Follow steps one through one hundred
Repeat as necessary

Your problemis alittle nore acute naybe but fundanentally the sane
thing

Its like that conputer thing the Chinese room You renenber that Qe
guy sits ina little room laying dow cards wth etters witten on
themin a language he doesnt understand laying themdowmn one etter
at a tine in a sequence according to soneone elses instructions The
cards are supposed to spel out a joke in Chinese The guy doesnt
speak Chinese of course He just follows his instructions

There are sone obvious differences in your situation of course You
broke out of the roomthey had you in so the whole enterprise has to
be portable And the guy giving the instructions-thats you too just
an earlier version of you And the joke youre telling well its got
a punch line I just dont think anyones going to find it very funny
So thats the idea All you have to do is follow your instructions
Like clinbing a ladder or descending a staircase Qne step at a tine
Right down the list Sinple

And the secret of course to any list is to keep iit ina place where
youre bound to see it

HE CAN HEAR THE BUZZING through his eyelids Insistent He reaches out
for the alarm clock but he cant move his arm

Earl opens his eyes to see a large man bent double over him The man
looks up at him annoyed then resumes his work Earl looks around him
Too dark for a doctors office

Then the pain floods his brain blocking out the other questions He
squirms gain trying to yank his forearm away the one that feels like
its burning The arm doesnt move but the man shoots him another
scowl Earl adjusts himself in the chair to see over the top of the
mans head

The noise and the pain are both coming from a gun in the mans hand—a
gun with a needle where the barrel should be The needle is digging
into the fleshy underside of Earls forearm leaving a trail of puffy
letters behind it

Earl tries to rearrange himself to get a better view to read the
letters on his arm but he cant He lies back and stares at the
ceiling

Eventually the tattoo artist turns off the noise wipes Earls forearm
with a piece of gauze and wanders over to the back to dig up a
pamphlet describing how to deal with a possible infection Maybe later
hell tell his wife about this guy and his little note Maybe his wife
will convince him to call the police

Earl looks down at the arm The letters are rising up from the skin
weeping a little They run from just behind the strap of Earls watch
all the way to the inside of his elbow Earl blinks at the message and
reads it again It says in careful little capitals I RAPED AND KILLED
YOUR WIFE

Its your birthday today so I got you a ittle present I would have
just bought you a beer but who knows where that would have ended

So instead I got you a bell I think I may have had to paw your watch
to buy it but what the hel did you need a watch for anyway

Youre probably asking yourself Why a bell In fact Imguessing
youre going to be asking yourself that question every tine you find it
in your pocket Too nany of these etters now Too nany for you to dig
back into every tine you went to know the answer to sone little
questi on

Its a joke actually A practical joke But think of it this way Im
not really laughing at you so much as Wth you

Id like to think that every tine you take it out of your pocket and
wonder Why do I have this bell a little part of you a little piece
of your broken brain WI renenber and laugh ike Imlaughing now

Besides you do know the answer It was sonething you earned before
So if you think about it youll know

Back in the old days people were obsessed Wth the fear of being
buried alive You renenber now Medical science not being quite what it
is today it wasnt unconnon for people to suddenly wake up ina
casket So rich folks had their coffins outfitted Wth breathing tubes
Little tubes running up to the mud above so that if someone woke up
when they werent supposed to they wouldnt run out of oxygen Now
they must have tested this out and realized that you could shout
yourself hoarse through the tube but it was too narrowto carry nuch
noise Not enough to attract attention at least So a string was run
up the tube to a ittle bell attached to the headstone If a dead
person cane back to life all he had to do was ring his little bell
till someone care and dug himup again

Imlaughing now picturing you on a bus or naybe in a fast-food
restaurant reaching into your pocket and finding your little bell and
wondering to yourself where it came from why you have it Maybe youll
even ring it

Happy birthday buddy
I dont know who figured out the solution to our nutual problem so I
dont know whether to congratulate you or me A bit of a lifestyle
change adnittedly but an elegant solution nonetheless

Look to yourself for the ansver

That sounds ike something out of a Hallmark card I dont know when

you thought it up but ny hats off to you Not that you know what the
hell Imtalking about But honestly a real brainstorm After all

everybody else needs mrrors to remind thensel ves who they are Youre
no different

THE LITTLE MECHANICAL VOICE PAUSES then repeats itself It says The
time is 800 am This is a courtesy call Earl opens his eyes and
replaces the receiver The phone is perched on a cheap veneer headboard
that stretches behind the bed curves to meet the corner and ends at
the minibar The TV is still on blobs of flesh color nattering away at
each other Earl lies back down and is surprised to see himself older
now tanned the hair pulling away from his head like solar flares The
mirror on the ceiling is cracked the silver fading increases Earl
continues to stare at himself astonished by what he sees He is fully
dressed but the clothes are old threadbare in places

Earl feels the familiar spot on his left wrist for his watch but its
gone He looks down from the mirror to his arm It is bare and the skin
has changed to an even tan as if he never owned a watch in the first
place The skin is even in color except for the solid black arrow on

the inside of Earls wrist pointing up his shirtsleeve He stares at
the arrow for a moment Perhaps he doesnt try to rub it off anymore
He rolls up his sleeve

The arrow points to a sentence tattooed along Earls inner arm Earl
reads the sentence once maybe twice Another arrow picks up at the
beginning of the sentence points farther up Earls arm disappearing
under the rolled-up shirtsleeve He unbuttons his shirt

Looking down on his chest he can make out the shapes but cannot bring
them into focus so he looks up at the mirror above him

The arrow leads up Earls arm crosses at the shoulder and descends
onto his upper torso terminating at a picture of a mans face that
occupies most of his chest The face is that of a large man balding
with a mustache and a goatee It is a particular face but like a
police sketch it has a certain unreal quality

The rest of his upper torso is covered in words phrases bits of
information and instructions all of them written backward on Earl
forward in the mirror

Eventually Earl sits up buttons his shirt and crosses to the desk He
takes out a pen and a piece of notepaper from the desk drawer sits
and begins to write

I dont know where youl be when you read this Imnot even sure if
youll bother to read this I guess you dont need to

Its a shane really that you and I wWi never neet But like the
song says By the time you read this note Ill be gone

Vé re so close now Thats the way it feels So many pieces put
together spelled out I guess its just a natter of time until you
find him

Who knows what weve done to get here Mist be a hel of a story if
only you could rerenber any of it I guess its better that you cant

I had a thought just now Maybe youl find it useful

Everybody is waiting for the end to cone but what if it already passed
us by What if the final joke of Judgrent Day was that it had already
corre and gone and ve were none the Wser Apocalypse arrives quietly
the chosen are herded off to heaven and the rest of us the ones who
failed the test just keep on going oblivious Dead already
wandering around long after the gods have stopped keeping score still
optimistic about the future

I guess if thats true then it doesnt matter what you do No
expectations If you cant find him then it doesnt natter because
nothing natters And if you do find him then you can kill hi mw thout
worrying about the consequences Because there are no consequences

Thats what Imthinking about right now in this scrappy little room
Franed pictures of ships on the wall I dont know obviously but if I
had to guess Id say were sonemere up the coast If youre wondering
why your left armis five shades browner than your right I dont know
what to tell you I guess we nust have been driving for a while And
no I dont know what happened to your watch

And all these keys I have no idea Not a one that I recognize Car
keys and house keys and the little fiddly keys for padlocks What have
we been up to

I wonder if hel feel stupid when you find him Tracked down by the
ten-minute nan Assassinated by a vegetable

Iil be gone ina nonent Ill put dow the pen close ny eyes and
then you can read this through if you went

I just wanted you to know that Improud of you No one woo natters is
left to say it No one left is going to want to

EARLS EYES ARE WDE OPEN staring through the wndow of the car
Smling eyes Smling through the Wndow at the crowd gathering across
the street The crowd gathering around the body in the doorwey The
body enptying slow y across the sidewalk and into the stormdrain

A stocky guy facedown eyes open Balding head goatee In death as
in police sketches faces tend to look the same This is definitely
somebody in particular But really it could be anybody

Earl is still smiling at the body as the car pulls away from the curb
The car Whos to say Maybe its a police cruiser Maybe its just a
taxi

As the car is swallowed into traffic Earls eyes continue to shine out
into the night watching the body until it disappears into a circle of
concerned pedestrians He chuckles to himself as the car continues to
make distance between him and the growing crowd

Earls smile fades a little Something has occurred to him He begins
to pat down his pockets leisurely at first like a man looking for his
keys then a little more desperately Maybe his progress is impeded by
a set of handcuffs He begins to empty the contents of his pockets out
onto the seat next to him Some money A bunch of keys Scraps of

paper
A round metal lump rolls out of his pocket and slides across the vinyl
seat Earl is frantic now He hammers at the plastic divider between
him and the driver begging the man for a pen Perhaps the cabbie
doesnt speak much English Perhaps the cop isnt in the habit of
talking to suspects Either way the divider between the man in front
and the man behind remains closed A pen is not forthcoming

The car hits a pothole and Earl blinks at his reflection in the
rearview mirror He is calm now The driver makes another corner and
the metal lump slides back over to rest against Earls leg with a
little jingle He picks it up and looks at it curious now It is a
little bell A little metal bell Inscribed on it are his name and a
set of dates He recognizes the first one the year in which he was
born But the second date means nothing to him Nothing at all

As he turns the bell over in his hands he notices the empty space on
his wrist where his watch used to sit There is a little arrow there
pointing up his arm Earl looks at the arrow then begins to roll up
his sleeve

Youd be late for your ow funeral shed say Renenber The nore I
think about it the nore trite that seens What kind of idiot after
all is in any kind of rush to get to the end of his ow story

And how would I knowif I were late anyway I dont have a vetch
anynore I dont know what ve did Wth it

What the hell do you need a watch for anyway It was an anti que
Deadvei ght tugging at your wist Synbol of the old you The you that
believed in tine

No Scratch that Its not so much that youve lost your faith in tine
as that tine has lost its faith in you And who needs it anyvay Vho
wants to be one of those saps living in the safety of the future in
the safety of the nonent after the nonent in which they felt sonething
powerful Living in the next nonent in which they feel nothing
Crawing down the hands of the clock away fromthe people who did
unspeakable things to them Believing the lie that tine W heal all
wounds—-whi ch is just a nice way of saying that time deadens us
But youre different Youre nore perfect Tine is three things for

nost people but for you for us just one A singularity One nonent
This nonent Like youre the center of the clock the axis on which the
hands turn Time noves about you but never moves you It has lost its
ability to affect you Wat is it they say That tine is theft But not
for you Close your eyes and you can start all over again Conjure up
that necessary enotion fresh as roses

Time is an absurdity An abstraction The only thing that natters is
this nonent This nonent a million tines over You have to trust ne If
this nonent is repeated enough if you keep trying-and you have to keep
trying-eventually you W come across the next itemon your list

End
