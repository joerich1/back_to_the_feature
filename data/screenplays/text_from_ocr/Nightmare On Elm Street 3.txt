A womans pregnant belly Next moment a tiny fetal hand tipped
with nascent steel claws jabs up out of the belly and rips down

DISSOLVE FROM THIS PICTURE TO --

EXT TWO-LANE BLACKTOP -- DAY

The ground gives off shimmering waves of heat An AUTOMOBILE
ENTERS FRAME

INT AUTOMOBILE -- DAY

NANCY THOMPSON listens to the radio as she drives Shes the
Nancy we remember but a little older now more of an adult a
woman

cide rate among 15 to 19 year-olds

She turns the station to Rock

EXT FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD DAY

A TEEN-AGE GIRL with long red hair stands roadside her hair
blowing her thumb out listlessly Its the same girl we saw on
the last of the missing-child posters She is barefoot dirty
Nancys car ENTERS FRAME and stops Nancy reaches over opens
the door The Hitcher gets in and they pull away

INT NANCYS CAR -- DAY

Nancys glad to have company on this baked desolate stretch of
road

NANCY

You must be really hot How
can you stand on that asphalt
without shoes

(the Hitcher says nothing)
Whats your name

(again nothing)
Where you going

HITCHER
Down

NANCY
Down where

HITCHER

Down where he fucks you

We HEAR the EXPLOSION of a tire the car lurches

EXT ROAD - DAY
The ‘car swerves off the gravel shoulder into a field

After a beat Nancy gets out inspects the tire
CLOSER ANGLE
Its shredded

NANCY
Shit I thought that was a good
tire And me without a spare

She straightens and looks around cocking her head

NANCY
You hear kids singing

The Hitcher rolls her window up from the inside and locks the
door Nancy looks back to her a little uneasy now

NANCY (CONTD)
Look uh Im gonna go see if
theres a house over there I1l
be right back
(as she goes)
Theres water in the back seat

THE FIELD

As Nancy walks we HEAR CHILDRENS VOICES singing and as she
draws closer we recognize the tune to a familiar nursery rhyme
“ though we still cant make out the words

NANCY

She emerges from a clearing stopping Disturbed with what she
sees

NANCYS POV

BOYS and GIRLS jumping rope in front of a ramshackle ranch-style
house (We recognize the house from our opening scene of the
nightmare birth) The Boys jumping rope in front of it are
dressed in suits the Girls in party-dresses They dont see
Nancy and shes transfixed

CHILDREN
One two Freddys coming for you
Three four better lock your door
Five six grab your crucifix —-

Then they are suddenly aware of her presence and scatter as she
moves towards them vanishing into the darkness of the trees
NANCY

Approaches the house The yellow lawn is littered with abandoned
tricycles Theres a wrecked car half-sunk in the unraked drive
and what looks like a dead possum belly up and flyblown farther

back by a sagging out building

Nancys on the porch now We HEAR a lonely WIND-CHIME

CLOSE OP WIND CHIME

A conventional mobile-like wind-chime -- excpet that the chimes
are long razors

CLOSE UP NANCY

She reacts

CLOSE UP WIND-CHIME

The chimes are now normal

NANCY

She ENTERS the house -

INT HOUSE DAY

The house is completely empty Even when new this place could
never have been more than spare and cold Now its a few rooms
of blown leaves broken windows and flaking paint Nancy hears a
momentary metallic WHIRR back in one of the back rooms Then it
stops

NANCY
Bullo

She slowly makes her way in the half-darkness back into
A BACK CORRIDOR —-

She sees what looks like a doorway But then sees its an
elevator

As if she cant help herself she goes to it and then moves her
finger through space until it presses its button -- and the doors
immediately open

The word DOWN lights up beneath the button She ENTERS
THE ELEVATOR

She tilts her head to look at the numbers above the door
EXTREME CLOSE UP ”

The floor numbers begin at one then jump 25 and 50 at a time

until they read 250 275 300 400 1000 2000
5000 etc

- NANCY

She makes a sudden movement to get out of the elevator too
late The doors slam shut and the car begins its descent

The elevator shakes as if gaining tremendous velocity Nancy
begins to panic From the position of Nancys body inside the
‘elevator we see that not only is the car dropping with
incredible speed but it is also at times moving SIDEWAYS in its
shaft through the earth like a roller coaster car

THE FLOOR

It begins to slide open from beneath Nancys feet Hot air gusts
her from below She SCREAMS

ANGLE ON RAZOR-GLOVED HAND

It comes from the hellish pit of the shaft and feels around the
receding floor as if looking for a clawhold Nancy SCREAMS as
she tries to kick it off stepping on it with her heel The
floor continues to recede but the car begins to right itself
so that by the time it finally comes to a stop the empty space
where the floor was is now the elevators ceiling The razored
hand has disappeared Nancy bolts the car

DARKNESS A CORRIDOR

A GIANT TRICYCLE wheels its way toward her riderless It stops
in front of her

VOICE
Nancy

Out of the darkness steps JOHN Nancys father Hes wearing his
policemans uniform and is much as we remember him -- except that
his hair has started to grey

NANCY
(incredulous)

Daddy
She runs to him hugs him crying

NANCY (CONTD)
Why did you leave me Ive been
looking for you so long -—-

JOHN
I found him baby Five years
And I burned him again He was
born in this house And now hes
burning

He turns to the wall We see a steel handcuff bolted into
cement through it is a burned hand flesh off the bone
twitching Nancy walks to it the arm of the hand disappears
around the corner The father sees this and reacts in surprise

JOEN
Wait a minute Wheres the rest
of him gotten to

B
EXTERIOR FIELD THE CAR DAY

The Hitcher in the car is drinking from a bottle of Evian water
watching out the side window Wary

LOOKING PAST AND BEHIND HER -- THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD -—-

We SEE what at first looks like some quick-moving python -- and
then can be seen to be Freddies hand and long long arm snaking
up in a graceful are over the hood rearing back - then snapping
forward with striking force --

With a sudden explosion of tempered glass the windshield blows
out and as the startled girl snaps around and opens her mouth to
scream the razored hand shoves itself straight into her mouth

Like a hand controlling a puppet it lifts her first up then
back and out of the car with great ease right through its
shattered windshield

EXT CAR -- DAY

The hand with its long snakelike arm drags the girl towards a
nearby tree No part of Freddies arm ever touches ground -—- but
it methodically dangles the girl so that her feet do making
tracks right to the tree

AT THE TREE --

As Freddies snakearm lifts the girl up into the dark leaves
tite a python taking its victim up to its bower To swallow at™
leisure

INT CORRIDOR - DAY

Nancy and her Father race along a corridor following the arn
Then the thing goes right through a barred window into darkness
They cant follow John stops clutching his chest

JOHN
(gasping)
Hes so sly You cant close
your eyes If you close your eyes
eeche gets awayeece
(laughs)
But Im going to take care of
that

With one hand he pulls the skin of his eye lid away from his
face The skin is elastic the lid comes out three or four
inches He holds the index finger of his other hand up it has a
razor on it He brings it down slicing off the lid Nancy
SCREAMS

INT CAR - NIGHT

Nancy is still SCREAMING -- alone in the front seat of her car
Shes awakened by a powerful flashlight flooding her in light
She panics and bolts from the car -- but is caught in the arms of
A MAN WITH FLASHLIGHT She fights yelling and scratching -- the
Man lets go jumping back

Nancy jerks away stumbles and falls

VOICE
Jesus its okay Im not gonna
hurt you

Half up and ready to run Nancy turns back calmed by the voice

NEIL GUINESS -- a good-looking man in his late twenties peers
back at her the most open non-threatening sort of person you
could ever want to meet in a dark field in the middle of the
night

NEIL
You okay

Nancy stands up a bit shakily and brushes off her skirt

NANCY
Sorry Mustve fallen asleep
at the wheel

“e

Or was that a dream too

She looks around No sign of anybody else

NEIL
Well I think the hitcher moved

Your axles broken

Nancy checks out the wheel -- its pushed up into the car

NANCY
Oh God my poor caree

Neil shoves his hands in his pockets and thinks

NEIL
Look I live just a few miles from
here You can stay in the guest room
Thats not a line by the way Any-
way it would be better -- in case
you get nausea or a headache That
can happen with a bump on the head

Nancy looks him over more carefully The more she looks the
more she trusts him

NANCY
What about my car

NEIL
We can get it in the morning On
my way back to the hospital

NANCY
(smiles)
Youre not one of those serial
killers are you

Hes already walking back towards his car

NEIL
I was gonna ask you the same thing

Come on
She starts off after him sniffing the damp night air

NANCY
God whats that awful smell

NEIL
There 8 blood on the car
(waits for her to catch
up -— walks next to her)
Thats why I was so worried You
mustve hit an animal

EXT NEILS HOUSE -- NIGBT

A white wooden house surrounded by orchards

INT NEILS HOUSE BREAKFAST ROOM - NIGRET

Neil refills Nancys coffee The house is warm and homey

NANCY
It wasnt iike my father to
disappear He was a cop and all
-- very hard-ass and by-the
book

NEIL
So you just took after him

NANCY
Followed him through five states
Each place he was the peoples
descriptions of him changed First
he was just some tough-looking cop
Then he was just a guy needing a
shave Then he was a drunk who got
in a fight Then he just disappeared

NEIL
Just drifting

NANCY
shakes her head)
Not drifting Looking He was
looking for something A place
A house I never could figure out

NEIL
(pours her more)
You drink a lot of coffee

NANCY
Habit I got intowhen I was in

She drinks deeply and settles back in her chair avoiding his
eyes scanning the room Books paintings a split-bamboo

fishing pole hanging on the wall

NANCY (CONTD)
(casual) —
So can you interpret dreams I mean

me what it meant

EXT NEILS HOUSE -- LATER THAT NIGBT

Wind gusts the dark rows of trees A WIND CHIME is blown so
fiercely it has no time to make a sound

INT NEILS ROOM -- NIGHT

Neil lays atop his bed unable to sleep Staring at the ceiling
still dressed except for his shoes He swings his long legs over
the edge of the bed and runs his hands through his hair

INT UPSTAIRS HALL -- NIGHT

Neil goes into the bathroom and has a drink of water Pads back
out into the hallway Stops Looks down the hall

HE CAN SEE -- the LIGHT from the guest room the door open a
crack

INT GUEST ROOM —- NIGHT

Neil ENTERS with a light knock Nancy has fallen asleep with the
light on Or is that the way she sleeps

He goes to shut off the light and notices a bottle of
prescription pilis on the nightstand He picks them up

CU - THE PILLS
The lable reads HYPNOCYL 60 mg 1-2 tabs FOR SLEEP

BACK TO NEAL

He sets them down and looks at Nancy sleeping Shes beautiful
in sleep o

Re looks away turns off the light and EXITS

Int NEILS DEN bated NIGHT

NEIL searches through a thick reference book
INSERT THE PAGE

His finger underscores HYPNOCYL on the pages

The FDA has classfied the indications
for this experimental drug
EFFECTIVE for the managment of the
manifestations of psychotic disorders
POSSIBLY EFFECTIVE for sedation where
dreamless sleep is considered optimal
suppression of night terrors

BACK TO NEAL

Thoughtfully he closes the book and looks upward towards Nancys
room

INT GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

Nancy sleeps The window is open a light wind billows the
curtains Next moment the Hitcher FLOATS through the window into
the room her head covered with her hanes and arms

She stops in mid-air above Nancys bed Nancy awakens

HITCHER
(plaintive)
He tore my hair off My beauti-
ful red hair

The Hitcher slowly removes her hands from her head The red hair
and bloody scalp slides off her head and flops onto Nancys
covers right over her chest

NANCY
Oh JesuS
Nancy is frozen in shock

CLOSER ON THE HAIR as it begins to move like a red wet
creature from some hellish seabottom It moves up to her neck
and begins to choke her Nancy gasps for air trying to pull it
off She cant budge it from her throat And meanwhile the
Bitcher descends closer tipping down at the head until her face
is so close Nancy can feel her chill

HITCHER
(mocking)
You must be really hot How
« could you stand on that asphalt
without shoes

NANCY
Get away from meeee

REVERSE TO THE DOOR -—— as Neil enters wondering at the voices in
the night He reacts in shock

REVERSE -- NEILS POV --

Nancy wrestles on the bed with an invisible tormentor There is
no Hitcher no throttling hair She turns and sees him —- her
face contorted with very real terror

NANCY -
Neil Neil Help me

Neil crosses with a quick shamble jumps onto the bed and
slaps her across the face stunning her Then he sidles
backwards straddling her legs moving back to her feet --

And Nancy watches in horror as Neils lower jaw dislocates and
drops slowly toward the bedclothes his skin stretching
grotesquely like taffy

Neil fastens his gaping mouth on Nancys feet - like an
anaconda and slowly begins to envelope her legs her hips
devouring her whole

Nancy screams helplessly as Neilthe snake bumps up against her
chin and we see that his face has transformed to that of
Freddie With only her head left to devour he looks at her and
laughs --

FREDDIE
Now give Freddie a little head
hmm
Nancy jams her fingers into his face -- clawing and SCREAMING at
the same time

NANCY
God damn you

REVERSE TO THE DOOR ONCE MORE as NEIL - the real Neil --
ENTERS

He rushes to the screaming Nancy and finally manages to waken her
from her nightmarewithin-a-nightmare

“ NEIL
Easy Nancy easy Its going to
be all right Easy
The girl draws away from him wide-eyed and distrustful backing
‘up against the headboard She instinctively reaches for her
pills Then she throws them down shaking her head in
realization
NANCY
They dont work anymore The pills
dont fucking work

She goes to bury her face in her hands then jerks away from her
own fingers Looking more closely at them

CLOSER -- ON HER FINGERS AND NAILS
Shreds ef some awful charred something hang from them
If Neil didnt know better hed almost swear it was flesh

She wipes her hands off furiously on the bedcovers Then sinks
into his arms

As he holds her we DISSOLVE TO

EXT THE COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING

A gorgeous panorama of rural isolation A ribbon of road
Neils car

INT NEILS CAR - DAY

Neil and Nancy ride silent a moment Nancy nursing a cup of
coffee steaming in one of Neils mugs Then
NEIL

NANCY
A doctor at a clinic Back when I
lived on Elm Street

NEIL

Neil slows and looks off

NEIL

EXT FIELD - DAY
The SHRIEKING OF BIRDS

At first they dont notice this as they pull over to the field
Nancy swerved into the night before The tracks left by Nancys
car are still there But they end at nothing The car is gone

NANCY
Dammit

Neil looks around looking for a logical explanation

NEIL
Farmer probably had it towed is
all
sees her look)
Ill drop you in town Its probably
waiting at a gas station right now

Nancy is studying a nearby tree a huge spreading oak Theres
a flapping shifting cloud of black up there A whole rookery of
hungry demand She looks away from the crows uneasy

NANCY
It stinks like rotten eggs around
Lé

NANCY (CONTD)
here

Neil has taken an ever-so-slightly more professional air hes
concerned about her -

NEIL
Maybe you should come with me
To the hospital I mean I mean

Nancy turns and walks back to the car

a
AT THE CAR as they get in
NANCY

You think theres an Elm Street

NEIL

I wouldnt be surprised Every town

She gets in and closes the door Looking back
They pull back onto the road As they do CAMERA TILTS UP to the
tree once more The crows have grown even more in numbers the
black wings flapping in from all directions The SHRIEKING of
the birds reaching crescendo co
EXTREME CLOSE UP THE BIRDS
They are picking at something at the top of the tree frenzied
We cant see what it is but its big and dark and messy And
the shrieks of the crows are deafening roaring electronic
EXT HOSPITAL - DAY

The sprawling low-slung facade

INT HOSPITAL ENTRANCEWAY -- DAY

INT HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM -- DAY

Neil rushes in and joins several other DOCTORS including a tall
no-nonsense woman - DOCTOR SHIRLEY MADDALENA MD PHD — his
immediate superior at the institution The girl theyre all
working over KIRSTEN is young no more than 16 - and is
stunningly beautiful She also is fighting like a tigress
trying her best to twist away -- to push them off her eyes
glazed her mouth contorted in fear or disgust

Two ORDERLIES (MAX a big black guy one of them) literally pin
her to the table so the doctors can fight to save her -- for her
wrists are a mass of blood

Neil reacts

NEIL
Jesus -- I know this kid
(leaning down to her)
Kirsten Its Doctor Guiness
What happened

Kirsten twists away knocking the big 200 pound black man back as
if he was nothing -—- jamming herself up into a corner jars and
instruments clatter to the floor And somewhere shes found a
pair of really nasty-looking scissors and she holds them in
front of her like a trench knife ready to skewer the first
perscn who comes near her

The room falls into stunned silence The girl looks from Neil to
soméone else behind him To Nancy whos watching from the
coorway And then the girl starts rocking and singing to
herself
ad

KIPSTEN
Seven eight better stay up late

Nine ten neveresee NEVELeee

She cant find the words in her chaotic mind and rocks slashing
them all back when they try to reach her Shaking and moaning
getting worse by the second Then --

NANCY
Never sleep again

instantly Kirsten stops Her eyes swing round then clear
Kirsten drops the scissors Sags against the wall A single big
tear rolling down her cheek The doctors rush in

NANCY (CONTD)
(as if coming out of a
trance to Kirsten)
Who taught you that rhyme

The girl doesnt answer Nor does Kirsten make any effort to
resist the doctors Its as if the hands and wrists now being
stitched belong to someone else Her eyes are locked on
Nancys Neil looks at Nancy too confused by this girl with
strange gifts

B
INT SPECIAL YOUTH WARD (THE UNIT) -- DAY

CLOSE ON A SQUARE RATCH OF STEEL AND RIVETS It slams open
revealing the faces of Nancy and Neil

MAX the big black orderly unlocks the thick metal door that
contains this observation hatch and swings it opens

Hey doc

NEIL
Hey Max Hows it going

MAX

NEIL
This is Nancy Thompson Max
Nancy this is Max -- he runs

this ward
Nancy exchanges greetings but already shes already distracted
on some deep level seemingly merely by the place The ‘Unit

Max watches her walk alone into the ward not waiting for Neil
As if looking for someone or some thing she already knows

MAX
Little older than the rest aint

NEIL

Shes not a patient Max
a
Max cracks a sly grin
MAX
Then what is she boss

Neil looks at Nancy and adjusts his glasses Grins

rooms inhabitants -- VARIOUS TEENAGERS lounging around the hall

Menthol regular ultra-light

Kirsten appears wrists bandaged and comes over

KIRSTEN
Nancy

She gives a careful hug -- then steps back instantly a more
guarded But she gives a little smile And Nancy smiles back
warm and direct

NANCY
Kirsten How ydoin Okay

Kirsten gives a little shrug Coping

Nancy nods We get the feeling she understands the girl
completely and at the same time we sense that Nancy’ has no idea
why she feels this way

Neil leads Nancy on Max pacing them

MAX
(sotto voce)
We called her mother -- the woman
didnt even want to come get her
daughter -- said she was getting
her legs waxed today Can you

INT UNIT - CORRIDOR

Neil rushes out to see several ORDERLIES wrestling a huge boy
down the hall Nancy ENTERS from the room too Looking
strangely drawn

INT QUIET ROOM DAY
The Orderlies strap the boy down to a chair bolted to the floor

in the center of the room Although the straps are thick leather
and the chair sturdy the huge kid strains and lurches so hard
oo

that everything seems seconds from giving way

NEIL
Kincaid coo it out You want
to be left off medication cut

Kincaid glares at him --

KINCAID
Fuck youl

He snaps one of the thick leather bands immediately knocking
an orderly sprawling —- uprooting the chair And he half scoots
half hops across the room - kicking a leg free just in time to
drop another Orderly with a hard kick to the shin And then hes
free of it kicking the whole broken chair into a corner
‘standing up like a grizzly and bellowing --

KINCAID

Im gonna lunch you fuckers so
bad your grandchildren are gonna
be born with broken arms

He starts for them -- then stops

REVERSE TO HIS POV -- TO NANCY -——-

Just standing in the doorway

BACK ON KINCAID

Stone silent Still Mouth a little open Like a kid caught
with his hand in the cookey jar

NANCY
What did you see

He answers in a tiny voice full of vulnerability

KINCAID
I want to go home

Nancy advances on him like a calm firm mother No nonsense
NANCY

Kincaid swallows

KINCAID
The man with the hat

little catch to it now

NANCY
What was his name

Kincaid looks down at her blinks then grins

KINCAID
“ Dr Seuss

He dissolves into laughter a hacking cachination that bends him
over in paroxysm of coughing He holds his sides and rocks
suddenly silent overwhelmed

KINCAID (CONTD)
Oh man Oh man a

He sits down in the middle of the floor and holds his head as if
if were a cracked vase

LOOKING INTO ANOTHER LARGE ROOM

Theres a table chairs Nancy feels some strange
reluctantance to step inside but forces herself Her first step
is her last -- the floor is ripple-less fluid -- and she

plunges in over her head The table and chairs remain hanging
in their own gravity intact

UNDERWATER

Stunned Nancy sees something at the bottom of the pool and swins
towards it Its her father in a policemans uniform inky
red blood streaming from where he cut his eyes

AT THE SURFACE -- as Nancy bursts back out gasping for air

She pulls herself out of the watery pit and flops exhausted onto
the floorboards of the hall Then she hears a BABY CRYING
Upstairs ‘

ANGLE AT THE STAIRS

- Nancy goes up

INT UPSTAIRS HALL — DAY

She follows the sound of the babys CRIES down this corridor
thats somewhat slanted to the side somewhat out of kilter She
‘seems to get larger as she goes the perspective shifting
crazily

She arrives at a door tiny compared to her now huge bulk
INTERCUT HALLWAY AND NEW ROOM
She stops as she SEES --

AN INFANT -- clothed in filthy little trousers and red and green
sveater and with a grimy leather glove on cne hand

A glove tipped with long keen blades on each finger

NANCY

The infant stops crying instantly turns and lifts itself on one
elbow And its face is Freddies - a hash of burned flesh
sneering teeth and gleaming eyes And he raises his claw to
her

FREDDIE
Oh mamaaaaa

Ee suddenly swells into the proportiens of Freddie the man -- his
room swelling in size and him with it

Nancy crashes back against the wall of the hallway nearly
falling the hall is so crazily tilted now and she is
Shrinking

love him He leaps off the table and the chase is on

Jennifer ENTERS turns on TV sits down in chair She watches
for a few moments We HEAR the drone of canned laughter from an
old sitcom Then STATIC

She gets up and tries to adjust the set

Unable to get the picture to return she smacks the side of the
TV once twice The third time her hand is grabbed by a hand
THAT COMES OUT OF THE SIDE OF THE TV

Startled Jennifer tries to move away No dice -- the holding
hand is powerful relentless Simultaneously a second hand --
this one RAZORED -- comes out of the screen itself -- while
Freddies head stretches out from the top of the set wearing the
‘rabbit ears of its antenna like some horrible insect

FREDDIE
Heeeerrrrreeesss Freddie

JENNIFER
Max Please help me

But Max doesnt come —- and with hideously brutal force Freddie
lifts her up and back his arm stretching so that Jennifer
hangs poised in front of the set His head ducks back in like
some huge ugly fish diving and reappears in the screen

We can SEE the TV SCREEN -- Freddies face filling it obscenely

JENNIFER
Help me Please God help me

FREDDIE
Weve got a wonderful show for you
tonight Jennifer ‘Lights Out

With that he RAMS her head like a battering ram straight into
the screen shattering her skull and the thick glass with a
ringing blow and implosion of brain tube and phosphors

in half out of the hissing sparking set

Her head nods
KIRSTEN
Begins to close her eyes
BACK TO BRAD
BRAD (CONTD)
«-eand beyond this only the anti-
world the realm of the dead
SALLY - nods out
EXTREME CLOSE UP KIRSTEN

As if through a fog now Sound is stretched out and muffled
She stands up

LOOSEN TO MEDIUM SHOT OF CLASS

Brad is reading but what comes from his mouth is slowed down
weird incomprehnsible Kirsten stands and walks over to Sally
who is filing her fingernails Sally looks up at her with a
bitch smile - then Kirsten TEARS OFF SALLYS BLOUSE AND BRA
with one quick yank

SMASH CUT
KIRSTEN AWAKENS with a start -- still at her desk

SALLY SCREAMS -- shes half-naked her blouse torn off in the
middle of class

At first the Kids are stunned then they begin to SHRIEK with
laughter The Teacher vainly tries to get control Brad throws
his jacket to Sally who hides beneath it as she slinks out She
somehow suspects Kirsten -- but Kirstens practically on the
other side of the room She tosses Kirsten a dirty look as she
storms out -- Kirsten returns it with a smile of growing
realization and amusement The Kids continue to howl Brad
races after Sally

EXT RANCH HOUSE -- NIGHT
ANGLE ON THE HOUSE --
Dark Waiting

We hear a SOUND NANCY coms INTO FRAME -- lugging a gasoline
can

She gets about halfway across the yard to the front porch when
the SOUND of an approaching car catches her attention

She freezes turns and sees --
HEADLIGHTS -- IN HER POV -- APPROACHING
Nancy runs into some bushes --

CLOSE ON HER IN BUSHES -- she ditches the gasoline can and
hunkers down

NANCY
(low)
Oh shit
IN HER POV -- we SEE a POLICE CAR cruise by
Stop

A COP géts out Looks at the house Stretches turns and
caught in the light of his headlights starts to relieve his
bladder

BACK ON NANCY -- groaning

NANCY (CONTD)
Great

She starts to look away then something else catches her eye
Her eyes snap back to the car

ANGLE BACK TO THE CAR -- as a big German Shepherd police dog
jumps out ears pricked eyes straining towards her nose lifted
bobbing sucking in those molecules of Nancys scent drifting to
him over the slow tide of night air

NN

He starts to trot towards her stops bristles and barks
sharply Then a low growl

BACK ON NANCY

NANCY
Oh god oh god

THE COP --
Zips up turns and regards the dog
COP
What ya got a rabbit Huh

He laughs and takes out his service revolver Aims lazily
BLAM

ON NANCY -- as the round buzzes through the bush not five inches
from her head She leaps up --

NANCY
No
THE COP -
jerks the gun up in the air -- his mouth drops open --
CoP
Jesus H Christ
NANCY

steps out of the bush away from the gas can trying to calm the
barking dog walking for the cop The cop calls the dog off

eyeing Nancy right back Suspiciously

COP (CONTD)
What the hell you doin’ out here

bush

Nancy smooths her jeans gives her best imitation of an easy
laugh

NANCY
Same thing you were doing

The cop is brought up short He laughs back

COP

Well you goddam near got your
head blown off doin it tonight

Nancy draws herself up

NANCY

She flashes a hospital ID The cop scrutinizes it in his
flashlight then shrugs

COP

Nancy starts walking The cop watches her go

NANCY

FATHER

She sighs and sits down with him

NANCY

The man shakes his head and laughs softly

FATHER

Nancy ponders the odd word turning it over in her mind
NANCY

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO

EXT KIRSTENS HOUSE -- NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT The house mostly dark except for one window
on the second floor

INT KIRSTENS ROOM -- NIGHT
Kirsten in PJs dials Listens Someone answers

KIRSTEN

Nancy

(response)
Oh Well would you tell her Kirsten
Parker called

(question)
Oh sure everything is just fine
I just wanted to say hello

(question)
No no thats not necessary I
Maybe I11 call tomorrow

She hangs up Sighs not knowing quite why she called what she
would have said anyway

She lies down on her bed

Sullenly she looks at a number of brochures obviously provided
by her mother all of ST GIRARDS CATHOLIC SCHOOL FOR GIRLS
Pictures of Sisters girls in uniform stoic surroundings She
casts them onto the floor in disgust

She turns off the light Shes just settling under the covers
when both her arms are jerked into the air in the position of
crucifixion Her legs kick off the covers and complete the
picture Horrified she watches as STIGMATA appear on her hands
her feet her stomach Trembling her “crucified” body then
hovers over her bed

CLOSE ANGLE ON HER BEDROOM WINDOW -- OPENING from an invisible
ve

hand Kirsten floats through into the night air

EXT KIRSTENS HOUSE -- NIGHT

We see the form of Kirsten float out the second story window and
hang in mid-air in front of the house lit by a street-lamp

KIRSTEN
(faint timid)
Somebody help me

EXT CATHOLIC SCHOOL -- NIGHT

The frightened crucified body of Kirsten drifts into the
entrance of a school whose door reads “ST GIRARDS There is a
cross that is next to the sign and the cross squirms like a
starfish or insect thats been pinned

INT CATHOLIC SCHOOLCORRIDOR -- NIGHT

She drifts vertically now through the lockerlined corridor
The doors of the lockers flap open emitting steam as if they
are portals to Hell She ENTERS a classroom

INT CLASSROOM -- NIGHT

The classroom is full of CATHOLIC GIRLS in uniforms They sit at
their desks hollow eyed All of them have bandages around their
wrists - as does Kirsten bandages that are bloody and
tattered fluttering in an unseen wind

Kirsten screams as she is floated past them and into the dark
Cloakroom The girls do not hear her screams their uniforms are
a green and red plaid

INT CLOAKROOM --
A row of green and red striped sweaters raise their arms on
hangers as if to greet Kirsten as she floats in They grab her

and pull her down She is no longer crucified but still has
the stigmata She escapes through a door and surfaces inside

INT RANCH HOUSE -- NIGHT

She lands in front of the elevator that Nancy encountered in her
first dream The door opens eagerly -- and FREDDIE lurches out
at her shrieking

FREDDIE
Did you cross yourself today

He crosses himself with his razored glove slashing his burned
rotting skin so that pus and blood ooze forth from the
“Zorro-like lacerationpattern He laughs and Kirsten runs up
the stairs as he chases her

MOVING WITH KIRSTEN -- nearly praying --
KIRSTEN
(to herself)
Please Nancy -- help me Youve
got to come Nancy

INT NEILS GUEST ROOM (WAKING REALITY) - NIGHT

Nancy sits in bed light on fully awake She is making an entry
in her diary when suddenly her pen flies away from between Ler
fingesr Then the diary is flung crisply against the wall Then
the covers tear off of her

NANCY
Jesus -- whats going on
No time for an answer -- next instant Nancy is pulled down into

the center of her bed with a whoosh -- GONE

INT RANCH HOUSE -—- NIGHT (KIRSTENS DREAM)
Freddie has Kirsten cornered at the end of the upstairs hall

FREDDIE
You can check gn to this dream
Kirsten
(hold up the steel claw)
but you cant check out

KIRSTEN
Nancy

Freddie lunges -- and at the same time Nancy DROPS THROUGH THE
CEILING and crashes atop Freddie knocking him sprawling Nancy
rolls away instinctively looking around in panicked bafflement

Kirsten regains her wits just enough to grab her friends hand
and run Freddie is up and after them in a flash

MOVING WITH THEM -- DOWN THE LONG CORRIDOR --
NANCY furious shocked --

NANCY
What have you done to me

KIRSTEN
I dont know I mean -- I know
but I cant believe it

‘

They slam a door in Freddies face --

-ANOTHER CORRIDOR -- ENDLESS -- the girls racing along as they try
to figure what the hells going on

NANCY
What happened

KIRSTEN
I -- I just wished you were here --
and -- you were

Freddies claw can be heard ZINGING - SCRAPPING along the iron
wall behind them -- coming closer

NANCY
Well then wish us out of here

They jam on the brakes stopped by a slimey brick wall They
turn and see Freddie bearing down on them like a mad dog

KIRSTEN
I wish I was back in bed

Instantly they vanish -- and Freddie smashes into the brick wall
at full speed -- WHAM
INT KIRSTENS BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Kirsten plummets from nowhere onto her bed - hitting like a ton
of bricks A second later Nancy crashes onto the floor

Beat They both recover enough to look at each other stunned

NANCY
Where would he wake up Did you

Have you dreamed of him before

Kirsten looks off Troubled

KIRSTEN
I cant remember I think I have
but whenever I try to think of
when I just get sort of fogged
out

Nancy leans closer

NANCY
Do you think you could pull him
out of a dream Like you pulled
me

Kirsten looks around sharply

KIRSTEN
You mean pull him into my room
(low)
I dont ever want to see him again
Ever

NANCY
You might not have a choice about
that

Kirsten looks deep into Nancys eyes -- then looks quickly away
afraid of the grim certainty she sees in them

KIRSTEN

Nancy takes her hand

NANCY
Kirsten will you help me You
wont have to face him
(Kirsten looks back)

Zill do that

EXT NEILS HOUSE -- DAY

A pleasant day A little breeze Birds whistle at each other

INT NEILS GUEST ROOM -- DAY
Nancys room shades drawn - a warm golden half-light

Nancy lies on the bed dressed except for her shoes Trying to
relax herself into sleep Kirsten sits at the side of the bed
looking nervous

KIRSTEN
This is dumb I should go with
you We had twice as much power
together

NANCY
Its too dangerous Just keep an
eye on me a close eye and wake me
up if I look like Im in any kind
of distress Okay

KIRSTEN
It just seems so old fashioned this way
Kinda dumb

NANCY
It works believe me

Kirsten looks at Nancy more carefully

KIRSTEN
Youve done this before havent
you

NANCY

Just do what I say okay
Nancy closes her eyes Kirsten goes to the window tips back the
blind and looks out Some wind has come up spooking the trees
Kirsten turns back to Nancy shes already asleep
EXT RANCH HOUSE - DAY
UP ANGLE TO THE SKY Nancy floats down touching the earth
She heads for the bush
ANGLE IN THE BUSH as Nancy finds the can of gasoline

ANGLE AT THE PORCH -- as Nancy steps up to the front door
Something catches her eye She looks down

NANCYS POV the scruffy welcome mat outside the door Its
Welcome’ is spelled out in maggots

NANCY -- reaches for the door knob Holds her breath

A split-second before she opens the door somebody comes CRASHING
OUT OF NOWHERE -- and thuds onto the porch inches from her ©

Nancy jumps back with a shriek -- only to see its
KIRSTEN A little shaken up a little sheepish
KIRSTEN

Uh thought you might need a

little help
Nancy lets out her breath in a shakey gasp

NANCY

Jesus you scared the shit out of

me
Kirsten stands up and brushes herself off whispering

KIRSTEN
Any sign of the bastard

As if answering there is a low menacing GROWL from behind them
They turn to see -—-

THE GERMAN SHEPHERD POLICE DOG -- BOT --

ROW BOTH fae A SOT OF GREEN AND RED STRIPED FUR -- AND THE READ
OF FREDDIE in place of the Oxiginal dogs

KIRSTEN (CONTD)
Oh god

And with that he charges

ANGLE BACK ON THE WOMEN - as they run for it -- Nancy dropping
the gasoline can -- both racing pell mell into the house

INT RANCH HOUSE (DREAM STATE) - NIGHT

LIVING ROOM -- the women race through

BACK ON THE DOOR -- the Freddie dog barges through saliva
drooling from the monstrous mouth
A HALLWAY -- as the two run through it

NANCY
In here

They dart inside a door Slam it
DARKNESS

Their eyes adjust to the dim light of the room There is a kind
of fog that hangs in the air

‘ KIRSTEN
(whispers)
Nancy Im so scared He can smell
my fear Im surel

NANCY
Dont let him well get out of
this

Nancy leads them to another door as the fog in this part of the
room begins to lift She opens the door and

JENNIFER lurches into its frame maggots devouring her head

JENNIFER
Help me

The girls SCREAM and turn around only to be confronted by --
FREDDIE - fully human again -- big as a house He slashes out
at them -- Kirsten dives back but not quite fast enough -- and
Freddie cuts her arm deeply Nancy grabs the now hysterical girl
and drags her out the door into --

HALLWAY

Nancy and Kirsten continue to run through the winding hallway of
the house

KIRSTEN
Oh shit -- Kincaid Help us

INT HOSPITAL (WAKING REALITY) - NIGHT

Kincaid is snoring in a chair in front of the TV Joey sits
nearby watching the tube

CLOSE UP - KINCAID

Agitated in his sleep His body begins to tremble as Nancys
did when Kirsten first ‘pulled her in And then he is SUCKED
DOWN INTO THE CHAIR -- and next instant hes gone

JOEY

Looks over At the empty chair

INT RANCH HOUSE HALLWAY (DREAM) —- NIGHT

Kincaid crashes into the dream hitting the floor like a two
hundred and fifty pound flesh bomb eight feet behind Freddie
The whole hallway shakes from the concussion and Freddie leaps
around

KINCAID
What the fuck

He staggers up just as Freddie runs at him glove of steel claws
raised to strike Kincaid takes this in in one microsecond --
and his street instincts cut in in the next -- his big fist
shoots out on pure reflex and connects square on Freddies jaw

Freddie cartwheels backwards as the startled kid looks around and
sees Nancy and Kirsten

NANCY KIRSTEN
Way to go Kincaid

KINCAID
Where the fuck am I

He turns to Freddie just in time to see Freddie rise up this
time twice as darae -- looming up dike a giant banshee his claws
twice as long

KINCAID
Holy shit

Nancy moves with split second instinct --
NANCY
(to Kincaid)
Grab her arm quick

Kincaid does as hes told as Nancy does the same with her left
hand Nancy looks up at the startled Kincaid as Freddie comes
closer --

NANCY
(sincere -- fast)
Ill explain later Kincaid --
meanwhile we gotta get outta here

And with that she hauls off and -- slaps him hard

INT ASYLUM TV ROOM (REALITY) -—- NIGHT

A startled Kincaid shoots up out of the chair and crashed back

down into it landing upside down A split second later Nancy

and Kirsten plunge out of thin air and crash into the room with
him All are stunned and disoriented

Joey takes this all in stunned

MAX

races in hearing the commotion -- Kirsten is nearly hysterical
and bleeding badly from the arn

KINCAID
(shocked)
Musta been the acid I took in sixth
grade
MAX

Jesus -- this is gonna need stitches

He hauls her up holding his hand over the wounds just as
Doctor Maddalena ENTERS The woman stops shocked and
infuriated by this intrusion of disorder

MADDALENA
What happened to her Did you do

(turning to Nancy)
As for you just who the hell do you

Nancy is too exhausted to respond

She stalks out

Nancy considers this carefully
NANCY

I dont think its easy Its
scary So final But at least
it takes the pain away

He touches her She doesnt look at him

NANCY (CONTD)
The only reason I dont kill myself
now is because I still wouldnt
have a guarantee that he would
leave me alone even after I was
dead

Neil gently takes her face and turns it to his

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO SOMETIME LATER NEW ANGLE --
THE TWO are fast asleep Nancys eyes slowly open She HEARS

the dripping of a faucet OFF SCREEN Slipping a robe on she
gets out of bed ‘

INT BATHROOM DAY

Its the sink faucet dripping Dripping blood its basin
drenched in deep scarlet

NANCY twists the faucet shut The blood stops

But now another faucet is dripping A heavier spurting sort of
DRIPPING

CLOSE ON NANCYS EYES -- swiveling to look

IN HER P0OV -- we SEE in a gap between the wall and the shower
curtain the larger faucet of the tub

CLOSE UP FAUCET -- gushing blood and strands of what look like
tissue and hair

VOICES
Nancy -- help us
Nancys eyes jerk around to the shower curtain -- one of those

milkyclear things of heavy plastic

REVERSE IN HER POV TO THE SHOWER CURTAIN -- as the faces of
PHILIP the HITCHER and JENNIFER press up against it smeared in
blood their dead eyes staring like dolls eyes their mouths
moving against the plastic supplicating -

WRAITHS
Kill him Nancy -- kill him before
he kills us all --

A bloody hand comes round the corner of the curtain up near the
rod and begins to pull it back The SOUND of the curtain hooks
4d

scraping along the steel rod makes a high SCRAPING SOUND exactiy
dike Freddies claw

INT BEDROOM -—- DAY

BACK WITH NANCY IN BED —- as she awakens with Neil shaking and
about to scream She clamps her hands over her mouth stifling
it but the sudden move jolts Neil awake nontheless He sits up

awake alert

NANCY

INT HER FATHERS CELL -- NIGHT
CLOSE UP NANCYS FATHER

Pale brooding At last he speaks

JOHN
You cant afford to remain neutral
any more Nancy Hell get you if
you are -- youve been drawn into
an even bigger fight than you were
before

SHOT WIDENS TO INCLUDE NANCY
Nodding in agreement

NANCY
I can see that What I cant
understand is the mechanism I
mean what the fuck is going on

He rubs his chin

JOHN
I think through Kirsten youre
literally experiencing the next
JOHN (CONTD)
generation of the fight She
can fight in ways you cant --
nothing against you -- its just
an evolutionary leap Our mistake
was thinking she was the only one
The others -- these kids wandering
here from across the country --
they must all be warriors For
the final battle against Krueger

NANCY
But what can I give them

JOHN

They need you to lead Nancy
Youre the veteran -- youve fought
him before But youve got to move
now before he cuts you off at the
pass

(leans closer softly)
Yknow

Nancy looks up at him

NANCY
But I cant even get to them now

He leans back smiles

JOHN
I have an idea concerning that

He pulls something from his trousers A big seriouslooking

key

Nancy grins

JOBN (CONTD)
Maxs master key Lifted it off
him when he was in here the other
day Played catatonic so he never
suspected me I bet hes sweating
bricks right now wondering where

he left it
(smiles)
You game

NANCY
You know I am

INT CORRIDORS OF THE HOSPITAL NIGET

In near total darkness the two make their way through the
labyrinth of the hospitals upper floors keeping to the back
ways the little-used passageways Johns blindness makes it all
the same to him light or pitch dark

NANCY
(whispered)
You planning on getting all of us
out past the guards at the front
gate

JON
No way Thats where they look for
attempted escapes Besides you
kidsve got better means at your
disposal dont you

Nancy thinks Realizes

NANCY
I guess we do

Next moment they arrive outside the back door leading into a
familiar ward

JOHN
Theres where your army waits
baby Bivouacked in confusion
demoralized not even knowing
theyre waiting for their general

They look in through the wiregrid window of the door
IN THEIR POV -- we SEE --
An emergency group therapy session is taking place with Kirsten

Kincaid Laredo Taryn and Joey - a very unsuccessful session
run by Neil and Doctor Maddalena

INT KIDS WARD -—- NIGHT
NEIL PACES darting from one kid to another --

NEIL
Come on you guys -- youre all
upset about something -- lets
talk about some feelings here -
lets get it out in the open

But all the kids are freaked out completely Semi-comatose
sleepless scared and mute

NEIL (CONTD)
Kincaid -- tell me whats going on

KINCAID
Eat shit and die headshrink

MADDALENA
Taryn -- how about you -- cant

Taryn shrugs off the question
TARYN
Nothin you can get on your scope
thats for sure
NEIL
Kirsten What happened the other
night
Kirsten says nothing Joey gives a twitch rocking chanting
JOEY
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my balls to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord my eyes to take
Maddalena stalks out slamming the door behind her
CLOSE ON NEIL sitting exhausted Defeated too
Then he hears a DOOR UNLOCK and OPEN softly behind hin
Next second the bowed heads of the kids come up as one their
eyes turning in unison their hunched shoulders straightening
all looking at --
NANCY and JOHN --
Moving into the room from the back entrance

KINCAID
Awright

NEIL jumps up aghast Kirsten runs to Nancy holds her

NEIL
Jesus -- How the helid you guys
get in here

TARYN
I knew youd come back
LAREDO
Let the games begin
NEIL
(to John)
Jesus - youre not supposed to
be out
JOHN

You call this out

Neil licks his lips scared The kids are all up on their feet
circling alert -- utterly opposite what theyve been All
gathering around Nancy

NEIL
I could call for help Nancy

Nancy touches his hand

NANCY
You wont I know you better
than that
(softer)

Just watch Please Just wait
and watch

Neil sighs lost between duty and loyalty and love

NEIL
What are you doing

Without answering Nancy lays down in the center of the floor
Instantly the kids join her They form a star heads in arms
extended hands linked Nancy motions for her father and Neil to
join

Her father does so Neil balks
NEIL

Nowee Ieee I dont know what
the hell youre doing

NANCY
Join us

NEIL
You guys culting out on me

He laughs nervously shivers and steps back Scared without
knowing why

And Nancy says only one word of instruction

NANCY
Kirsten

CLOSE ON KIRSTEN The haggard girl looks to Nancy Then accepts
the order

She closes her eyes

A moment later she is breathing deeply and slow plunging through
her enormous fatigue into instant deep sleep

The kids look at Nancy Neil looks at Nancy Nancys father
looks at her too

NEIL
So So shes asleep

Suddenly Nancy her father and all the kids vanish All
together In the twinkling of an eye

Neils eyes just about pop out of his head

NEIL (CONTD)
Holy Shit

EXT HILLTOP NIGHT

A towering hill caped by a star-filled sky Far below we can see
lights -- perhaps of the asylum There is a vibrant ‘polarized
look to it all as if it all is not guite real or is in some
sort of hyper reality far more acute than what were used to
experiencing

Into this our group still holding hands in a circle
MATERIALIZES Nancy her father Kirsten Taryn Joey Kincaid
and Laredo They slowly drop each others hands and look around
astonished even ecstatic And something is different about them

now They have been subtly but profoundly transformed

JOEY
Hey I can talk

Joey twisted and spasmodic Joey now stands tall strong and
graceful He leaps and laughs and is whole He takes a running
jump into Kincaids burly arms -- all laugh joyous

TARYN
(to Nancy)
Where are we
LAREDO

(pointing to the distant
lights below)
Isnt that the nut house

KINCAID
(dumping Joey who leaps
away laughing)
Weird It feels like Ive been
waiting my whcle fucking life to
get here But I aint seen this
Place never even knew it was here

Nancy stands in front of them all looking at them -- at the
clear eyes the straight bodies the lack of any tics or furtive
looks These kids are now something completely different -- no
longer fugitives or nut cases They look much more like -

NANCY
Warriors

The kids look at her puzzled curious Nancy looks to her
father he smiles nods -- looks back to the kids

NANCY (CONTD)
This place has been waiting for you
For all of us
(pacing before them
a diminutive Patton)
Five years ago I fought Freddie -—-
(to Kirsten and Kincaid)
The guy who nearly got you in
the dream --
JOEY
(suddenly sobered)

You saying thats what drove us
crazy made us try to kill ourselves

NANCY
(nods)
Except you didnt try to kill your-
self Joey And neither did those
other kids who died Its Krueger
-- thats how he works

KIRSTEN
You mean Jennifer and my friend
Becky
KINCAID
And Philip
KIRSTEN

But why dont we remember I mean
if he tried to get us

NANCY
I dont know -- maybe something he
did to your memory - maybe something
your own minds did to save your
sanity

JOHN
Until you could know enough to sort
it all out and deal with it Until
you knew who and what you really
were

The kids all turn and look at him lost But strangely excited
too

JOBN (CONTD)
The point is guys -- you all are
survivors for a reason - you all
have a level of strength -- a skill
that Freddie wasnt able to overcome
Re killed as many of the others as
he could as fast as they showed up
here -- but you got away

TARYN
You saying were all some kind of
ow

DO
(smiling realizing)
We are the Warriors

NANCY
Dream Warriors Sent by who or
what I dont know but sent to
kill Krueger -- that much I do
know

JOAN

What made you misfits and fuckups

in the real world is what makes

you a threat to him Here is where

you really come into your own

This is your home
The Kids repeat Were home’ to themselves incantatory a
realization almost religious

NANCY
Now if you dont want to fight
thats your right You can leave
right now I have no idea where

All take this in but are not influenced

KIRSTEN
How do we get there -- to the house

With that a DOOR appears -- in the middle of the air in the

middle of the dakness A DOOR with no structure around it
The kids look at each other

NANCY
I knew wed dream something up

EXT ASYLUM -- NIGHT

SEVERAL POLICE CARS are at the entrance of the hospital their
360-degree lights flashing

INT THE UNIT - NIGHT

The Kids ward A few COPS are at the Nurses Station -- one
conferring with Maddalena and Neil

cop
They couldnt have gotten far
(gathers up dossiers)
Weve got their descriptions and
pictures -- they wont get a chance
to hurt no one

NEIL
Im worried for their safety --
not for anyone elses - these
kids arent going to hurt anybody

The cop looks at Neil his eyes flat

COP
Thats right they arent
(back to Maddalena)
Any idea how the blind psycho
managed to escape

KINCAID
He stole a master key

MADDELENA
He was helped by his daughter
of course
(to Neil icy)
You know the daughter dont
you Doctor Guiness

Neil returns the look not flinching But inside
ee

FXT THE HILLSTOP -- NIGHT

The Group stands awed in formation in front of the door The
door itself has grown in size now and swings open massive and
imponderable As soon as it does a mass of ROARING FLAMES is
REVEALED beyond its frame

KINCAID
Uh-oheee

CLOSE-UPS

Each ones face the shadows and planes of light of the flames
playing over them the heat making them shine

Kincaid goes warily to the door and stretches out his hand so
that it is near the flames - then pulls it back

KINCAID
Motherfuckers hot

TARYN
Because thats all you know about
fire Its a trick
(braces)
Catch all you suckers later

And with that she lets out a BANSHEE WAIL and sprints headlong
into the door vanishing in the roar of flames The group gasps
and waits

Silence as all wait somehow to see if her fater was as
terrible as it looked or Then from inside the door --

TARYN
Get your asses down here chicken-
shits

The remaining kids look at each other joining in a unity they
have never shown before - link hands and charge the door as
one They literally dive through disappearing into the roaring
flames

Only Nancy and her father are left She turns to him Hes
perspiring His eyes are empty sockets again

NANCY
Your eyeSee

JOHN
You know I cant go with you
Nancy

NANCY
Daddy

JOAN

Im used up He used me up
But Ill show the fucker

NANCY
Daddy --
But too late -- John races for the doorway and flings himself
into the flames He arcs in -- and instantly there is the sound
of a horrible penetrating SCREAM -- a cry that spins away into
infinity far far away

NANCY -- cries out in loss -

NANCY (CONTD)
Daddy

But there is no response from beyond the fire now Nancy
slashing the tears away from her face with the back of her hand
turns with new resolve to the dor And with a war-like scream
she charges it

NANCY (CONTD)
Kruuuu -- gerrrrrrill

She throws herself into the fire And once shes gone the door
closes and then disintegrates into thin air Only Kruegers name
echoes through the cold night air

Q
EXT ASYLUM - DAY

Neil EXITS the facility chased by Doctor Maddalena There are
COP CARS and POLICEMEN ali over the place A major escape from a
mental institution amounts to something just this side of a coon
hunt for these guys

For Maddalena its a major embarassment

MADDALENA
Doctor Guiness -- I want to know
just what the hell went on in
that room
NEIL
So would I
(spins on her)
I already told you what I know --
they just disappeared goddamit

MADDALENA
Disappeared
NEIL
Poof
MADDALENA

NEIL
What the hell do you mean
MADDALENA
You tell me -- I think youre in
love with that girl -- and youre
too damn blind to see that she used
youl
NEIL

Fuck you very much Im going home

MADDALENA
Dont you dare talk to me like

She stops Freezes at the sound of -- SCREAMING -- coming from a
great distance -- but coming rapidly CLOSER All the cops hear
it too and turn staring as --

IN THEIR POV on the broad lawn of the institution -- the
figure of Nancys father MATERIALIZES -- blazing from head to
foot running straight at them

BACK TO NEIL

NEIL
Oh my god

Nancys father collapses practically at Neils feet The
Policemen run over and put out the flames with their jackets --
beating ‘them away until there is just smoke and the charred man
lying there
Be

NEIL (CONTD)
Get a gurney out here

Doctor Maddalena is beside herself --

MADDALENA
He must have set himself on

JOHN

Neil jerks around realizing the man has called his name He
kneels at the mans side and leans down to him And listens to
the last words of this bedeviled man

JOHN (CONTD)

Neil they went into the drean
Youve got to help them

Neil draws back frightened by the madness
NEIL
I dont understand you What
dream What can I do with a dream
JOHN
Go to the house The house is

the door The house is the door
to dreams

He dies

Neil stands up staggers back as the MEDICS arrive with the
litter too late

CLOSE ON NEIL MUSIC

INT THE RANCH HOUSE (DREAM STATE) -- NIGHT
The Kids are in the front room -- just inside the entrance All

intact all hyper alert Nancy sloshes gasoline along the wall
then orders them all to stand back - and tosses in a match

They all duck But nething happens No fire Nothing
Nancy goes up and smells the gasoline

NANCY
fts gas all right I dont get

She tries to light a curtain No fire Tries to light a chair
No dice

LAREDO
You have to burn the Wizard

They all turn and look a Laredo Knowing somehow that hes

NANCY
(determined going to
Plan B)
Okay then

CLOSE ON MOLOTOV COCKTAIL being topped off

WIDER -- and we SEE that in each of their hands now is a gasoline
bomb Nancy finishes filling the last from the gasoline can
then lays out the new battle plan

NAWCY (CONTD)

LAREDO
Shes right Were Knights all of
us and the Terrible Moment is
upon the Kindom of Hesh Sleepers
awakel

NANCY
Come on

ANGLE AT THE STAIRS -- as all start up Taryn the last in the
group

MOVING WITH HER

As the others draw slightly away she HEARS a VOICE -- and turns
her head back The others cannot hear it and continue upstiars
without her

VOICE Sugar Baby

Taryn turns back recognizing the voice although it makes no
sense

TARYN
Gran-ma

She backtracks into another room

INT A DEN

Taryn ENTERS looking around strangely Its a musty room
scuzzy and threadbare a tenement room that someone has tried to
make homey

Taryn sees a picture frame on the wall She crosses to it
PHOTO INSERT

Its Taryn in the arms of an old black woman her GRANDMOTHER
staring out at the camera

BACK TO TARYN
Shes puzzled

VOICE
Sugar-baby

She turns and sees an old rocking chair in the center of the
room its back to her She slowly goes around it -- and finds
herself looking into the old kind eyes of her Grandmother the
woman in the picture She is very old and very loving looking
sitting there rocking

TARYN
‘ Gran-mal

She puts down her gasoline bomb and throwing caution to the
wind rushes over and embraces the woman

GRANDMOTHER
(stroking her)
I knew youd come back to Grandma
Your Momma was so worried when you
ran way Whyd you run away sugar
baby

TARYN
I didnt run away Grandma - I just
woke up one day and I was in this
other place A hospital

GRANDMOTHER
And what are you gonna do now

TARYN
Stay here with you

GRANDMOTHER
Thats my sugar-baby You put your
head in my lap now

Taryn nestles into the old womans lap peaceful nurtured
Then Freddies foul voice booms from the old womans throat

FREDDIEGRANDMOTHER
Grandma your black ass

A huge maw erupts in the old womans thorax -- splitting her
dress open to reval rib-teeth heart tongue gut-gullet The
Grandmother now has Freddies cackling head and shove Taryn into
the bodyhole head first We can HEAR Taryns screams as she
goes in then hear muffled screams from within Soon she is

halfway in her torn jeans and black hightops kicking
furiously

FREDDIEGRANDMOTHER (CONTD)
The only problem with you Taryn
is sometimes youre hard to stomach

Then with renewed vigor Freddie pushes Taryn in like youd help
a sausage along into a grinder When just a foot is left an
impatient Freddy whacks it off tennis shoe and all and throws it

- into the hall

INT A BEDROOM

Joey ENTERS -- carrying the gasoline can He takes a quick look
around the spartanly furnished room - an ordinary bed with a
drab spread a chair a chest of drawers -- then starts dousing
the floor with gasoline

JOEY
You crippled me Krueger but
look at me now Now Im your
nightmarel

He puts the can down gets a match and prepares to leave the room
before he starts the conflagration -- then he looks up again at
the bed Its different The whole room is different Its all
pink girlish - frilly bedspread on a big four-poster a pink
telephone stuffed animals rock posters on the walls -- a
typical teen-age girls bedroom

AND A BEAUTIFUL TEENAGE GIRL sits on the bed -- wearing the
skimpiest of negligees

TEENAGE GIRL
Hi Joey
(hes too stunned to say
anything)
Dont you remember me Its Beth
Beth Dorsett from Hawthorne High

JOEY
looking closer amazed)
I remember you You used to laugh
at me The way I walked You and
your boyfriends

TEENAGE GIRL
Ive changed Joey And so have
yo

TEENAGE GIRL (CONTD)

you Youre so handsome now s0
BEXYees

(she moves toward him)
Dont you like my body

(she reveals her breasts)
I know you want me Joey Take me

The bedroom door shuts Joey doesnt notice it They embrace
in a kiss Joey seems to loosen up enjoying it

CLOSE UP

Her tongue enters his mouth a tongue that continues to grow from
her mouth snaking deeply as he gags and her arms clamp around
him like iron We notice now that she ds wearing Freddies hat
Her tongue snakes out his right eye popping it from its socket
then arcs around and dives right down into his other eye

TEENAGE GIRL
Youre such a good kisser Joey

Joey falls backwards clutching his empty eye sockets screaming
onto the four poster bed - an ugly sodden bed now graced with a
bizarre redgreen striped bedspread

JOEY
Somebody help me please God

The four posts become animate and grab Joey each one grabbing
him by one of his arms and legs They pull him tautly so that he
is now stretched in mid-air above the bed Freddies head
thrusts out of the headboard Freddy has become the bed -- as

Joeys body stretches taut as a rubber band and then SNAPS ina
spray of blood and shattered bone

EXT RANCH HOUSE -- NIGBT

Neils car screeches up and Neil jumps out
CLOSE UP NEIL

He looks up at the house curious afraid awed
LOW ANGLE HIS POV

The house rises before him MUSIC SWELLS

NEIL
(low to himself)
For in that sleep of death what
dreams may come

He walks to the porch passing the mobile
CLOSE UP THE MOBILE
The chimes are HUMAN FINGERS Pointing pointing

He knocks on the front door It swings open revealing the
darkness within

‘

NEIL
Nancy

INT RANCH HOUSE —- NIGHT

He ENTERS Nothing Empty His mouth suddenly opens
involuntarily in a yawn -- then wont close He EXHALES a bluish
fog Then the fog disappears and he closes his mouth again He
smiles as if hes successfully made some kind of transition

He SEES something 0C walks out of FRAME
CLOSE UP SCISSORS

They rest on a table in the entryway He picks them up sticks
out an index finger and SLICES IT OFF He feels no pain He
picks up the finger and puts it back on And its whole
again No blood no sign of amputation

NEIL
(thrilled intoxicated)
My God Im in
(beat)
Im in the dreamworld

Suddenly he hears a CRASHING from farther back in the house

NEIL (CONTD)
Nancy You back there

Still no answer He starts across the living room almost
tripping over the empty gasoline can there

AT THE BACK OF THE LIVING ROOM as Neil goes through the door
at its back into greater darkness

HALLWAY DEEP INSIDE THE DREAM RANCH BOUSE --
MOVING WITH NANCY -- calling --

NANCY
Taryn Joey

No answer for her either
She turns sensing something Calls a different name --

NANCY (CONTD)
FREDDIE IM BACK YOU SON OF
A BITCH
No sound Then Freddie steps out behind her Silent and intent
as a big evil cat Lifting his bladed glove

FREDDIE
Eat this Nancy
Nancy turns sees him - and throws her gasoline bomb right at -
his head
NANCY
Eat this

Freddie ducks - bomb ignites the whole wall in front of him --
and Nancy runs like hell

ANOTHER ROOM - LESS ASKEW

In a darkened room Neil hears the explosion Hears the yells
too -- and then sees smoke farther back in there farther

hed have guessed the house went
He races back in -- yelling -—

NEIL
Nancy

ANGLE AT A CORNER -- as Neil crashes straight into -- Nancy --
the two crashing together

Nancy jumps up - terrified for him --

NANCY
What the hell are you doing here

NEIL
Your father sent me -- hes

Nancy guesses it sagging

NANCY
(fighting back tears)
Neil you shouldnt be here
Its dangerous - and Ive got work
thats gotta be done pow

Neil laughs -- a little crazy himself --

NEIL
Are you kidding Im physically
inside a reality Ive been trying
to penetrate clinically for years
Do you think Id miss this chance

He moves forward Nancy and he separated only by a gauze of
smoke -- the young woman more and more afraid -

NANCY
Neil get out -- please This
isnt goddam research Youre
in deep shit

NEIL
Come here let me hold you
Dont you see I love it its
what Ive always theorized its
kind of like -- its like teje-
gision or something

NANCY
Yeah Well believe me what
youre about to see youd rather

be watching on television

NEIL
Its okay Whatever it is I can
handle it

She words are just out of his mouth when Freddie lunges out of
nowhere

FREDDIE
Is there a doctor in the house

NEIL
(paralyzed)
Holy ghit
NANCY
Come on

Nancy leaps through the veil of smoke and grabs Neil -- and the
two fall backwards -- narrowly missed by Freddie and running
down the hall Neil looking frantically back over his shoulder at
the gaining demon Nancy grabs Neil -- running with him as
Freddie is distracted by -- the fire building

Sidetracked - Freddie employs an extraordinary dream device --
and puts the fire out -- vomiting a stream of water straight out
of his mouth - onto the fire putting it out

MOVING WITH NEIL AND NANCY — stumblingrunning through a
‘cockeyed-reality of a corridor Neil crying out --

NEIL
Lets get the hell out of here

NANCY
Your dream or mine hotshot

He doesnt know the answer to that one -- all he knows is that
Freddie is coming after them again and they run once more

NEIL
Who is that guy anyway

NANCY
We gotta find the other kids before
its too late

MOVING WITH LAREDO --

He holds a torch high in one hand a SABRE out of a Dungeon and
Dragons scenario in the other He looks like a thin pirate

He moves down a wet stony set of stairs down into the basement
of the house

Then just as he reaches the bottom of the stairs he hears a
little voice calling his name

He twists around and sees a SEVEN YEAR OLD BOY come from the
shadows Dripping wet in a swim suit (A green swim suit with
a red stripe)
AU

Laredo is stunned
TOBY
Hi Laredo Dont you recognize
me Im Toby Your brother

Laredo recoils back into the darkness

LAREDO
(fighting not to be
overcome)
Youre not my brother Youre not
reall
Ao
TOBY

I was swimming in the pool Mommy
told you to watch me But you had
to talk on the phone

LAREDO
No It was a wrong number I couldnt
have been on for more than a second

TOBY
A second was all I needed to die
Laredo

The little boy and Laredo are now inches away from each other

TOBY (CONTD)
Laredo save me If youll just
hold me I11 be all right Its
a second chance -- for both of
us

Laredo reaches out And just as we feel Freddie is going to
strike Laredo strikes first -- kicking the ‘little boy hard
right in the nuts Instantly Freddie roars back with an unholy
bellow -- lurching back out of the little boys shape and
crashing into a wall

Laredo laughs and screams at him

LAREDO
You didnt think Id fall for that
did you Krueger
(more to himself amused)
Shape-changing -—- I can get into that
(then realizing)
I bet I can get into that

And with that Laredo changes shape into a ferocious gargoyle of a
thing ten feet high with Jong fangs and yeliow cats eyes

Freddie jumps back in shock as the thing hisses and eer ser ikes at
him -- and then just as suddenly Freddie changes into

zagged-ass black crow that flaps easy out of reach circling the
monster and pecking at dts eyes

The LaredoGargoyle snaps suddenly into the shape of a huge red
net swinging through the air swooping around the FreddieCrow
- and caturing it easily

But no sooner does this happen than the FreddieCrow changes
shape into a RUSHING BLOB OF GOO that easily squishes out between
the interstices of the net gathers on the floor and reforms
right back into Freddie -- who ducks behind a doorway -- just as
the net returns to the shape of Laredo -- who looks around
‘cockily for Freddie --

LAREDO
Guess that showed him

Next second Freddie roars out of the doorway with a gas-powered
post hole digger -- driving the giant screw straight into the
back of Laredo The whirling bit drills straight through the
startled boy -- spinning out his chest

FREDDIE
Screw you

LAREDO
Aaiiiiiiiiiiityi
Laredo twists into a screaming cloud of bloody vapor --

human-shaped -- human screaming -- shooting right down the
corridor and into --

be)
THE ROOM WITH NANCY AND NEIL

As the the bloody apparition of Laredo comes screaming through
the air coming down the hall like a dripping rocket --
bansheeing right past them and out into oblivion

NANCY
No

Nancy turns and runs with Neil - flinging open the first door --
and the corpse of Joey -- horribly dismembered -- snaps out at

her like some gory rubber band -

She and Neil scream and run the opposite direction -- tripping
over the dangling blood-oozing tennis shoe of Taryn --

They twist another direction running around a corner - crashing
straight into whats left of Taryn herself -- now nothing more
than a lurching mound of guts and terror

Nancy and Neil reel back terrified — running in pure panic now
-- throwing open the last door -- crashing straight into --

KIRSTEN AND KINCAID —
Alive and just as startled --

And all four scream in terror Then recover just enough to
confirm -

KINCAID
The others Where are they

NANCY
Dead

Next moment Freddie lunges out at them -- sweeping at them with
his gleaming claws --

Pissed -- Kincaid clears his throat with lightning speed and
spits a giant clam smack into Freddies eye

Freddie grossed out staggers backwards - and Kincaid kicks him
in the stomach -- sending him cartwheeling backwards down the
hall in a dark ball like a stricken spider He hits the far end
but by god he starts to get up again The guy is hurt but
tough

Nancy takes the opportunity to marshall their effort

NANCY
All your bombs -- come on we
gotta burn the fucker

And with that all unleash their firebombs at Freddie The hall
erupts into a firestorm -- a firestorm that hides Freddie - and
drives them back with surprising heat

They retreat suddenly realizing theyve set fire to the very
place they inhabit They back up running before the fire --
until theyre trapped against a wall with no doors

Trapped with the fire advancing The heat increasing by the
second

Nancy grabs Kirsten
NANCY

Kirsten -- its up to you You
pulled us in you can pull us
outl

Kirsten is terrified -

‘ KIRSTEN
But how - where

Nancy nails her with her eyes --

NANCY
Think of some place you know -- the
most familiar place you can and
get us there -- fast

Kirsten not even knowing quite what shes doing concentrates
‘for all shes worth The fire leaps closer but the second
before it sweeps over them they all vanish

B
EXT KIRSTENS HOUSE -- NIGHT

The driveway is choked with expensive cars VALET PARKERS We
REAR PARTY SOUNDS from within

INT KIRSTENS KITCHEN - NIGHT

Kirstens mother MRS PARKER is on the phone In the BG we
can SEE PARTY GUESTS WAITERS circulating with drinks and hors
doeuvres CATERERS busy themselves as she talks

MRS PARKER

(into phone testy)

She hangs up We FOLLOW HER to -
LIVING ROOM

The party continues An instant later Kirsten Nancy Neil and
Kincaid bomb out of thin air and CRASH onto the center table
shattering it Food drink and broken dishes fly everywhere
Guests scream and scatter

The gang of Dream Adventurers climbs off the table looking
around dazed almost as surprised at the mother

Rirstens father MR PARKER grabs her arm
MR PARKER
Just what the hell do you think
youre doing young lady

Mrs Parker staggers back up furious --

KIRSTEN
Let go of me
MRS PARKER
(to Neil)

And you Youre going to lose
your license over this Im

Neil ignores her turning to Nancy Shes gone white

NEIL
What is it
NANCY
Its Krueger He hes here
He -
She never ‘ett a chance to finish - next dnstant Ereddie ERUPTS
fxom the floor volcanic enraged a dream bujd dn a reality

shina i He lunges missing Kirsten by an inch but
Slashing right into the mother

The stricken woman crashes backwards into the screaming guests -
L106

looking down in horror at her own guts ballooning up through the
wound staring at them as if they belong to someone else Then

Freddie buries his head in them tearing them from her in thick

strings like a mad vulture She screams horribly as her bowels

are devoured

Then he lurches up and leers at Kirsten

FREDDIE
Next

Kirsten and her shocked troops turns and runs and the chase is
on -- out of the room and into --

INT DENTROPHY-GUN ROOM -- NIGHT

Kirsten leads them into her fathers den -- a rich mans game
room -- full of trophy heads and ouns

Kirsten near hysteria still manages to keep her wits enough to
remember her fathers hidden cache She races to a hidden panel
finds the trick switch -- and the panel swings open to reveal --

KINCAID
A fuckin AR 14 — awxisht

NEIL
Heres the clip

Next second the door into the place takes a direct hit from
Freddie -- his claws shredding it in one swoop right through the
wood Kincaid wheels around jams in the clip and fires

A tremendous volley -- the door explodes into a blizzard of wood
chips

OUTSIDE THE DOOR Freddie is sent flying into a wall -- spewing
blood from a score of holes --

DENTROPBY ROOM
Kincaid hollers triumphantly as the others pat him on the back

OUTSIDE THE DOOR -- Freddie staggers back up - madder than
ever

FREDDIE
Your asshole belongs to me
Kincaid

He assails the door again surviving Party Guests scattering in
all directions in bg

INSIDE THE DEN --

The gun is empty -- Kincaid flings it aside -- going for others
But these more tame game rifles are also all empty

KINCAID
Wheres the ammo

KIRSTEN
« I dont know

And Freddie is coming through the door Suddenly Neil grabs
Nancys hand -

NEIL
(ordering)
Link hands everybody

KINCAID
No time for bullshit Doc

NEIL
I said shut up and link hands
(all holding hands now)
Kirsten Im thinking of a place
a familiar place Can you see
it

Kirsten scrunches up her face in concentration as Freddie claws
through the last of the door --

NEIL (CONTD)
Can you see it Kirsten

KIRSTEN
I dont know Its hard
Im scared

The door breaks down compleately As Freddie screams towards
them -- something SNAPS audibly in the air and our four heroes
VANISH

Freddie crashes right through the place they were - clawing the
air in obscene frustration

INT ASYLUM CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

Doctor Maddelena is there rushing along making sure all doors
are locked when suddenly Neil Kirsten and Nancy tumble out of a
wall not five feet from her

Maddelena wheels around in surprise seeing the four
Meanwhile Neil Kirsten and Nancy turn at Kincaids cries

KINCAID
Help Oh shit help

Theyre shocked by a grotesque sight -- their friend is stuck
halfway through the wall his other half - back at Kirstens
with Freddie-- halfway between freedom and hell

KINCAID
Hes coming -—- get me out
Pull me out -- Please Hurry
They grab his arms --
NANCY

Kirsten concentrate Pull him inl

KIRSTEN
trying hard)
I cant Somethings blocking me
I cant

NEIL
(to Maddalena)
Help us for godsakes

A startled Maddelena joins them all tugging the hapless Kincaid
with all their strength -- the boy screaming --

KINCAID
Hes got my legs Oh God
hes hes going in me with
his hand Hes going inside me
Oh Godddddddd

And then the razor claws which entered Kincaid in one world now
emerge from his mouth like a curious metal insect The others
back off instinctively -- Kincaid is dead

The claws retract All watch in horror as Kincaids motionless
torso slides down the wall like a snail then when it reaches
the floor topple away from the wall neatly sheared

The women SCREAM as Freddies head and shoulders appear jutting
out of the wall sweeping at them with a shriek of triumph His
mouth suddenly becomes a crocodile-sized maw -

Maddalena

biting off
and head at the shoujders Neil Nancy and Kirsten run
in terror And Freddie streaks after them

NEIL
Jesus Christ -- are we in a night-
mare Or are we awakel

NANCY
No difference now

‘

They streak through a metal door and Kirsten wheels and slams it
hard —- catching Freddie full in the face Freddie crashes down
-- and the three race off --

STAIRS -

down the only escape route they find open to them -- down a
long flight of concrete utility stairs - Down down down
Freddie racing after them his claws scraping hideously on the
steel rails

AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS - in deep shadows now they brake at
a door Its wooden small weathered

INSIDE

They burst through finding themselves in

INT RANCH HOUSE BASEMENT

NANCY
Oh my god were back in his
ranch house

They slam the door behind them -- Freddies claws instantly
ripping into it from the other side

They race up a short flight of wooden steps - but one small
opening of the door reveals -- the whole upper house a sea of
flames

They run back down -- and Freddie is coming through the wooden
door from the hospital stairs

Neil playing his last macho card races halfway across the
cellar
tau

NEIL
(to girls)
I have a theory
(turns to Krueger)
This is my dream you ugly son of
a bitch - and nobody comes in
without my permission Understand

Get out of my dream

Freddie pulls up surprised at first Then amused a nasty smile
eracking his face

‘ FREDDIE
I dont want you faggot Fuck
off and die

Then fast as a snakes strike -- his arm shoots out extending
out across the distance with lightning speed -- (at least fifteen
feet) -- the fist on its end striking Neil full in the face --
knocking him out cold

Freddie moves right past him -- eyeing the girls gesturing with
his steel claws for them to come to him

FREDDIE
Cmere cunts

The girls fall back - trapped -- backing up against a coal bin
-- both losing their balance at the same time -- falling
backwards together into a long chutel
THE CHUTE
They slide and fall down down the chute -- plunging out into --
and
INT THE ORIGINAL BOILER ROOM
The girls fly out of the chute ass over teakettle and fall into a
mass of filthy clothing -- finding themselves smack dab in the
middle of Freddies original lair
They stagger up shaken looking around
NANCY
This is the place he took his
kids where everything started

The words are hardly out of her mouth before Freddie leaps out

from behind one of the surging boilers bathed in the red light
of its flames

FREDDIE
Welcome home Nancy
(wiggles the steel
at Kirsten)
You too juicy little bitch

And he comes for them Closer and closer Kirsten grabbing a
length of pipe desperate for any sort of weapon Freddie merely
knocks the pipe away Advances again

Hes right on top of them when Nancy suddenly remembers She
Slaps her forehead -

NANCY
Jesus -- this isnt the way to
kill Freddie --

And she grabs Kirsten -- turning her 180 degrees away from
Freddie

KIRSTEN
What are you doing

NANCY
Youve got to turn your back on
him - take his energy away

And indeed as the girls concentrate -- we see Freddie recoil --
afraid for the first time

NANCY
(chanting)
Take it away all of it away from
him

And Freddie begins to smoke

NANCY (CONTD)
Hes shit -- hes nothing

And Freddie with a great cry bursts into flames He careens
around the room and falls in a burning heap the flames surging
up in a tremendous conflagration

The girls take cover behind a boiler from the heat until the
flames go down and the room darkens somewhat

Fearful the girls stay behind the boiler listening for any
sound

Nothing All strangely quiet Then we HEAR something

Nancy stiffens dips and snatches up a jagged shard of steel - a
piece of Freddies gloves original fabrication -- the girl
instantly afraid again

But then theres a voice

VOICE (0S8)
» Nancy -

But the voice is not Freddies Its another voice entirely
familiar and warm And Nancy straightens and looks Sees her
father standing out from the smoke a shadowy but real figure

NANCY
Daddy

Re grins blackeneé by soot but alive

JOHN
Baby

He opens his arms for her She takes a closer look He steps a
bit out of the smoke closer to her Its really him And the
two move to each other the jagged steel blade almost falling
from Nancys hand The two reach out -- lovingly longingly --
and then -- almost at the same instant -- Nancy plunges the steel
blade deep into the mans chest as the man snaps upward with
the steel-bladed glove hes kept so well hidden till now And
both jolt together in a death dance as Kirsten screams and Nancy
reaches up and pulls at the face -- the skin pulling away to
reveal FREDDIE

They collapse together Freddie screaming a terrible cry of
mortal injury already beginning to dissolve and break apart
Kirsten races in snatching Mancy out of this horrible embrace
pulling dragging her away cradling her at last in her arms

Kirsten looks over her shoulder still terrified at what was
Freddie

KIRSTEN
I dont know if hes dead

NANCY
(knowing it)
Hes dying — his house is burning
and I am dying All his energy is
going I can feel it

She sags back against Kirstens breast Kirsten shakes her
gently tears brimming --

Nancy moves her mouth as if she has something important to say
but is too weak to talk Kirsten leans over and listens
intently We cant hear the words but Kirten nods fiercely

KIRSTEN
Ill do it Nancy You can count
on me
(Nancy smiles wanly)

But I wont let you die I wont
(lower with strange
intensity)

Im going to dream you
(whispering in
Nancys ear)

Im going to dream you into a

beautiful dream forever

forever

And she holds her tight closes her eyes And Nancy closing her
eyes in great peace fades away into nothing Kirstens arms
surround nothing but air

A moment later Freddie is nothing more than a heap of ashes
blowing across the boiler room floor Only one thing is left a
charred glove and four gleaming blades

Kirsten gathers them up in a torn rag and pockets then

INT HOUSES BASEMENT

Kirsten ENTERS the smoking place and grabs the unconscious Neil
dragging him across the floor to the stairs by the wall These
are the stairs leading to a double cellar storm door She flings
them open revealing a cool star-spangled night and trees
ablaze with the light of the burning house

The cool night air rushes in She starts dragging Neil up the
stairs

EXT THE RANCH HOUSE -- NIGHT

WIDE ANGLE on the two staggering away from the burning house -
an inferno now When shes got him at a safe distance she lets
him go laying him on the ground Then she turns to look at the
house

CLOSE UP KIRSTEN

Staring at the house with startling intensity

RANCH HOUSE

The flames become ‘phantom flames as the house itself seems to
become newer Cleaner younger until it is the same house we
saw at the beginning of the film in the fast zoom back from the
terrible infant ripping its mother

Kirsten stands now confident possessed -- and walks slowly
toward the house A WOMANS SCREAMS and in inhuman INFANTS WAIL
grow louder as she gets closer oe

INT RANCH HOUSE (PERIOD FRESH) -—- NIGHT

Kirsten ENTERS the house -- and we see the familiar living room
But now it is furnished with pieces from the Forties An old
radio blares a Forties tune that mingles sickly with the horrid
SCREAMS of the woman

Then the SCREAMS are cut off by what can only be heard as the
womans death

The house is horribly quiet

Kirsten starts up the stairs her face cold determined

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Kirsten takes out the dirty rag empties the sooty
still-gleaming blades into her hands Then she folds the rag
around their ends making a knife

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kirsten ENTERS The WOMAN lays beneath the bloody sheets Her
hair flung over her white motionless face Shes dead

Kirten walks slowly to the bed lifting the razored knife in one
hand her other hand moving slowly to the sheet to pull it back

She does slowly but theres only a deep pool of blood

Tiny bubbles rise in the pool Her fingertips move to touch its
surface slowly cautiously Just as she does a TINY
RAZOR-CLAWED HAND grabs her wrist with a terrific MUSIC STING

WIDER -- as it tries to pull her into the bed Kirsten screams
resisting pulling back tugging the horrid little thing out of
the pool

LOW ANGLE as she raises it out with the strength of sheer
determination - and we SEE the infant FREDDIE KRUEGER -- fesh
from the womb fresh from matricide its life of horror
stretching out before it

It looks old and wizened even as a baby strange monstrous
grotesque It clutches Kirsten as she takes it and slams it
against a wall trying to hammer the life out of it It screams
- but is it crying or laughing -- and her efforts seem to have
little effect Finally it lets go of her and she STABS it
impaling it with the blades -- the blades it will never grow up
to make

That done Kirsten backs away quaking with her effort
cryinge

DISSOLVE TO

EXT RANCH HOUSE -- DAWN
Neil and Kirsten lay in each others arms in front of the
still-smoldering ranch house Ashes now Theyve won

DISSOLVE TO

EXT NEILS HOUSE -—- DUSK

The season has changed The house is weathered but still kept
up Next to Neils car is a Rabbit with New York plates

INT NEILS ROUSEDINING ROOM -- DUSK
Kirsten and Neil have finished a meal together and are drinking

wine Kirstens hair is shorter Neil looks thinner a little
weary

NEIL

KIRSTEN

wanted me to And cause of
Mom and everything Its

KIRSTEN
Are you still on sabbatical

NEIL
Yeah Well it was great seeing

KIRSTEN

NEIL

She takes a little breath then decides to ask the question

KIRSTEN
Do you two still see each
other

Neil tries to keep a straight face but then a little smile
escapes his eyes

NEIL
Yeah we do In fact Im seeing
her tonight Thats why Im in
such a rush to get to sleep

Kirsten nods She knew it

KIRSTEN

Well gnight

NEIL

She hesitates by the door seeing something 0C She smiles

KIRSTEN

ANGLE ON JOEYS MODEL - the exact model of Freddies house that
we Saw Joey building earlier in his room at the hospital

NEIL
(nods)

Kirsten smiles again

KIRSTEN
Bye

She EXITS Neil watches her go then turns off the lights and
goes upstairs

PAN TO THE MODEL IN THE DARKNESS Dark itself Covert We HOLD
ON IT a long while Then -- in one of its tiny windows a light
blinks on And we HEAR the SCRAPE of STEEL AGAINST STEEL

FADE TO BLACK
