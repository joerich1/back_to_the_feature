On the other side of the door Cindy listens Deans voice
cracks A wave of confusion backs Cindy away from the door
She searches the room for an escape There are no windows
the only way out is through the locked door Trembling she
wraps her arms around herself She tries to make herself as
small as possible The spaceship bed is the only place

she can disappear She crawls underneath the covers curls
into a tight ball Sadness lets loose Cindys body pulses
