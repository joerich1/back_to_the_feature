Floyd and blows him away
Big D leaps off the bed and spins toward

Drexl waiting for him fires from across the
room
The blast hits the big man in the right arm
and shoulder spinning him around
Drexl makes a beeline for his victim and fires

He slams into the wall and drops
Drexl collects the suitcase full of cocaine
and leaves As he gets to the front door he
surveys the carnage spits and walks out

with water It aint any
kind of fun But what I
have to offer you Thats
as good as its ever gonna
get and it wont ever get
that good again We talked
to your neighbors They saw
a Mustang a red Mustang
Clarences red Mustang
parked in front of your
trailer yesterday Mr
Worley have you seen your
son
Cliffs defeated

CLIFF
Ive seen him

COCCOTTI
Now I cant be sure of how
much of what he told you
So in the chance youre in
the dark about some of
this let me shed some
light That whore your boy
hangs around with her pimp
is an associate of mine
and I dont just mean
pimpin in other affairs
he works for me ina
courier capacity Well
apparently that dirty
little whore found out when
were gonna do some
business cause your son
the cowboy and his flame
came in the room blastin
and didnt stop till they
were pretty sure everybody

was dead
CLIFF

What are you talkin about
COCCOTTI

Im talkin about a
massacre They snatched my
narcotics and hightailed it
outta there Wouldda gotten
away with it but your son
fuckhead that he is left
his drivers license ina
dead guys hand A whore
hiding in the commode
filled in all the blanks
CLIFF
I dont believe you
COCCOTTI
Thats of minor importance
But whats of major fuckin
importance is that I
believe you Where did they
go
CLIFF
On their honeymoon
COCCOTTI
Im gettin angry askin
the same question a second
time Where did they go
CLIFF
They didnt tell me
Coccotti looks at him
CLIFF
Now wait a minute and
listen I havent seen
Clarence in three years
Yesterday he shows up here
with a girl sayin he got
married He told me he
needed some quick cash for
a honeymoon so he asked if
he could borrow five
hundred dollars I wanted
to help him out so I wrote
out a check We went to
breakfast and thats the
last I saw of him So help
me God They never thought
to tell me where they were
goin And I never thought
to ask
Coccotti looks at him for a long moment He
then gives Virgil a look Virgil quick as
greased lightning grabs Cliffs hand and
turns it palm up He then whips out a
butterfly knife and slices Cliffs palm open
and pours Chivas Regal on the wound Cliff
screams
Coccotti puffs on a Chesterfield
Tooth-pic Vic returns to the trailer and
reports in Italian that theres nothing in the
car
Virgil walks into the kitchen and gets a
dishtowel Cliff holds his bleeding palm in
agony Virgil hands him the dishtowel Cliff
uses it to wrap up his hand
COCCOTTI
Sicilians are great liars
The best in the world Im
a Sicilian And my old man
was the world heavyweight
champion of Sicilian liars
And from growin up with
him I learned the
pantomime Now there are
seventeen different things
a guy can do when he lies
to give him away A guy has
seventeen pantomimes A
womans got twenty but a
guys got seventeen And if
you know em like ya know
your own face they beat

lie detectors to hell What
we got here is a little
game of show and tell You
dont wanna show me
nothin But youre tellin
me everything Now I know
you know where they are So
tell me before I do some
damage you wont walk away
from
The awful pain in Cliffs hand is being
replaced by the awful pain in his heart He
looks deep into Coccottis eyes
CLIFF
Could I have one of those
Chesterfields now

COCCOTTI
Sure
Coccotti leans over and hands him a smoke
CLIFF

Got a match
Cliff reaches into his pocket and pulls out a
lighter

CLIFF
Oh dont bother I got
one
(he lights the
cigarette)
So youre a Sicilian huh
COCCOTTI
(intensly)
Uh-huh
CLIFF

You know I read a lot

Especially things that have

to do with history I find

that shit fascinating In

fact I dont know if you

know this or not Sicilians

were spawned by niggers
All the men stop what they were doing and look
at Cliff except for Tooth-pic Vic who doesnt
speak English and so isnt insulted Coccotti
cant believe what hes hearing

COCCOTTI
Come again
CLIFF

Its a fact Sicilians have

nigger blood pumpin

through their hearts If

you dont believe me look

it up You see hundreds

and hundreds of years ago

the Moors conquered Sicily

And Moors are niggers Way

back then Sicilians were

like the wops in northern
Italy Blond hair blue

eyes But once the Moors

moved in there they

changed the whole country

They did so much fuckin

with the Sicilian women

they changed the blood-line

for ever from blond hair

and blue eyes to black hair

and dark skin I find it

absolutely amazing to think

that to this day hundreds

of years later Sicilians

still carry that nigger

gene Im just quotin

history Its a fact Its

written Your ancestors

were niggers Your great

great great great great-â€”

grandmother was fucked by a

nigger and had a half-

nigger kid That is a fact

Now tell me am I lyin
Coccotti looks at him for a moment then jumps
up whips out an automatic grabs hold of
Cliffs hair puts the barrel to his temple
and pumps three bullets through Cliffs head
He pushes the body violently aside Coccotti
pauses Unable to express his feelings and
frustrated by the blood in his hands he
simply drops his weapon and turns to his men

COCCOTTI

I havent killed anybody

since 1974 Goddamn his

soul to burn for eternity

in fuckin hell for makin

me spill blood on my hands

Go to this comedians sons

apartment and come back

with somethin that tells

me where that asshole went

so I can wipe this egg off

of my face and fix this

fucked-up family for good
Tooth-pick Vic taps Frankies shoulder and in
Italianm asks him what that was all about
Lenny who has been going through Cliffs
refridgerator has found a beer When he
closes the refridgerator door he finds a note
held on by a ceramic banana magnet that says
Clarence in LA Dick Ritchie (number and
address)

Hookers lounging about the apartment
DREXL
(to Marty)

Drexl sits down at a couch with a card table

of Chinese food A black exploitation movie is
playing on TV
DREXL
Looky here you want the
bitches to really fly high
make your rocks with Cherry
Seven-Up
MARTY
Pussy love pink rocks
This is not how Clarence expected to confront
Drexl but this is exactly what he expected
Drexl to be like He positions himself in
front of the food table demanding Drexls
attention

DREXL

chopsticks to
Clarence)

You could hear a pin drop Once Clarence
starts talking Marty goes on full alert Drexl
stops eating and the Whores stop breathing
All eyes are on Drexl Drexl drops his
chopsticks and opens the envelope Its empty
DREXL

Clarence flashes a wide Cheshire cat grin that
says Thats right asshole

Motherfuckin Charles
Bronson Is that who you

helpin hand -
Before Drexl finishes his sentence he picks up
the card table and throws it at Clarence
catching him of guard
Marty comes up behind Clarence and throws his
arm around his neck putting him in a tight
choke hold
Clarence with his free arm hits Marty hard
with his elbow in the solar plexus Well
never know if that blow had any effect because
at just that moment Drexl takes a flying leap
and tackles the two guys
All of them go crashing into the stereo unit
and a couple of shelves that hold records all
of which collapse to the floor in a shower of
LPs
Marty whos on the bottom of the pile hasnt
let go of Clarence
Since Drexls on top he starts slamming fists
into Clarences face
Clarence whos sandwiched between these two
guys cant do a whole lot about it
DREXL
Ya wanna fuck with me
(hits Clarence)
Ya wanna fuck with me
(hits Clarence)
Ill show ya who youre
fuckin wit

He hits Clarence hard in the face with both
fists
Clarence who has no leverage whatsoever
grabs hold of Drexls face and digs his nails
in He sticks his thumb in Drexls mouth
grabs a piece of cheek and starts twisting
Marty whos in an even worse position can do
nothing but tighten his grip aroud Clarences
neck until Clarence feels like his eyes are
going to pop out of his head
Drexls face is getting torn up but hes also
biting down hard on Clarences thumb
Clarence raises his head and brings it down
fast crunching Martys face and busting his
nose
Marty loosens his grip around Clarences neck
Clarence wiggles free and gets up on his
knees
Drexl and Clarence are now on an even but
awkward footing The two are going at each
other like a pair of alley cats not aiming
their punches keeping them coming fast and
furious Theyre not doing much damage to each
other because of their positions its almost
like a hockey fight
Marty sneaks up behind Clarence and smashes
him in the head with a stack of LPs This
disorients Clarence Marty grabs him from
behind and pulls him to his feet
Drexl socks him in the face one two three
Then he kicks him hard in the balls
Marty lets go and Clarence hits the ground
like a sack of potatoes He curls up into a
fetal position and holds his balls tears
coming out of his eyes
Drexls face is torn up from Clarences nails
Marty has blood streaming down his face frim
his nose and on to his shirt
DREXL
(to Marty)

You OK That stupid dumb-

While Drexl has his attention turned to Marty
Clarence reaches into his sock and pulls out
the 38 he stick the barrel between Drexls
legs Drexl whos standing over Clarence
looks down just in time to see Clarence pull
the trigger and blow his balls to bits Tiny
spots of blood speckle Clarences face
Drexl shrieks in horror and pain and falls to
the ground

Marty steps into the room
Clarence doesnt hesitate he shoots Marty
four times in the chest
Two of three Hookers have run out of the front
door screaming The other Hooker is curled up
in the corner Shes too stoned to run but
stoned enough to be terrified
Drexl still alive is laying on the ground
howling holding whats left of his balls and
his dick
Clarence points the gun at the remaining
Hooker

CLARENCE
Get a bag and put Alabamas

CLARENCE

The Hooker tears of fear ruining her mascara
grabs a suitcase from under the bed and on
her hands and knees pushes it along the floor
to Clarence
Clarence takes it by the handle and wobbles
over to Drexl whos curled up like a pillbug

shit I ended up breaking
down and buying it a few
days later Man I was ever
wrong

CUSTOMER
That good huh

He takes the magazine from the Customers
hands and starts flipping to the Elvis

article

CLARENCE
It tried to pin down what
the attraction is after all
these years It covers the
whole spectrum of fans the
people who love his music
the people who grew up with
him the artists he
inspired - Bob Dylan Bruce
Springsteen and the
fanatics like these guys
I dont know about you but
they give me the creeps

CUSTOMER

CLARENCE

ugly tree and hit every
branch on the way down
Elvis wouldnt fuck her
with Pat Boones dick

Clarence and the Customer laugh
INT HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CLARENCES ROOM -

Alabamas pretty beat up
and her face is black and blue

She has a fat lip
Shes crawling

around on the floor Virgil is tearing the
place apart looking for the cocaine
carrying on a running commentary

VIRGIL
Now the first guy you kill
is always the hardest I
dont care if youre the
Boston Strangler or Wyatt
Earp You can bet that
Texas boy Charles Whitman
the fella who shot all them
guys from that tower Ill
bet you green money that
that first little black dot
that he took a bead on was
the bitch of the bunch No
foolin the first ones a
tough row to hoe Now the

DAY
half as tough row to hoe
You still feel somethin
but its just so deluted
this time around Then you
completely level off on the
third one The third ones
easy Its gotten to the
point now Ill do it just
to watch their expressions
change
Hes tearing the motel room up in general
Then he flips the matress up off the bed and
the black suitcase is right there
Alabamas crawling unnoticed to where her
purse is lying Virgil flips open the black
case and almost goes snow blind
VIRGIL
Well well well looky
here I guess I just
reached journeys end
Great One less thing I
gotta worry about
Virgil closes the case Alabama sifts through
her purse
She pulls out her Swiss army knife opens it
up Virgil turns toward her
VIRGIL
OK Sugarpop weve come to
what I like to call the
moment of truth -
Alabama slowly rises clutching the thrust-out
knife in both hands Mr Karate-man smiles
VIRGIL
Kid you got a lotta heart
He moves toward her
Alabamas hands are shaking
VIRGIL
Tell you what Im gonna do
Im gonna give you a free
swing Now I only do that
for people I like
He moves close
Alabamas eyes study him He grabs the front
of his shirt and rips it open Buttons fly
everywhere

VIRGIL
Go ahead girl take a stab
at it
(giggling)
You dont have anything to
lose

CLOSEUP - Alabamas face Virgils right she
doesnt have anything to lose Virgils also
right about his being the moment of truth The
ferocity in women that comes out at certain
times and is just here under the surface in
many women all of the time is unleashed The
absolute feeling of helplessness she felt only
a moment ago has taken a one hundred and
eighty degree turn into Ill take this
motherfucker with me if its the last thing I
do seething hatred

Letting out a bloodcurling yell she raises
the knfe high above her head then drops to
her knees and plunges it deep into Virgils
right foot

CLOSEUP - VIRGILS FACE

Talk about bloodcurling yells

Virgil bends down and carefully pulls the
knife from his foot tears running down his
face

While Virgils bent down Alabama smashes an
Elvis Presley whiskey decanter that Clarence
bought her in Oklahoma over his head Its
only made of plaster so it doesnt kill him
Virgils moving toward Alabama limping on his
bad foot

VIRGIL
OK no more Mr Nice-guy
Alabama picks up the hotel TV and tosses it to
im He instinctively catches it and with his
arms full of television Alabama cold-cocks
im with her fist in the nose breaking it
Her eyes go straight to the door then to the
sawed-off shotgun by it She runs to it bends
over the chair for the gun Virgils left foot
icks her in the back sending her flying over
the chair and smashing into the door
Virgil furiously throws the chair out of the
way and stands over Alabama Alabamas lying
on the ground laughing Virgil has killed a
ot of people but not one of them has ever
aughed before he did it
VIRGIL
Whats so fuckin funny
ALABAMA
(laughing)
You look so ridiculous
She laughs louder Virgils insane He picks
her off the floor then lifts her off the
ground and throws her through the glass shower
door in the bathroom

VIRGIL
Laugh it up cunt You were
in hysterics a minute ago
Why aint you laughing now
Alabama lying in the bathtub grabs a small
bottle of hotel shampoo and squeezes it out in
her hand
Virgil reaches in the shower and grabs hold of
her hair
Alabama rubs the shampoo in his face He lets
go of her and his hands go to his eyes
VIRGIL
Oh Jesus
She grabs hold of a hefty piece of broken
glass and plunges it into his face

VIRGIL

Oh Mary help me
The battered and bruised and bloody Alabama
emerges from the shower Shes clutching a
big bloody piece of broken glass Shes
vaguely reminiscent of a Tasmanian devil Poor
Virgil cant see very well but he sees her
figure coming toward him He lets out a wild
haymaker that catches her in the jaw and
knocks her into the toilet
He recovers almost immediately and takes the
porcelain lid off the back of the toilet tank
Virgil whips out a 45 automatic from his
shoulder holster just as Alabama brings the
lid down on his head Hes pressed up against
the wall with this toilet lid hitting him He
cant get a good shot in this tight
environment but he fires anyway hitting the
floor the all the toilet and the sink
The toilet lid finally shatters against
Virgils head He falls to the ground
Alabama goes to the medicine cabinet and whips
out a big can of Final Net hairspray She
pulls a Bic lighter out of her pocket and
just as Virgil raises his gun at her she
flicks the Bic and sends a stream of hairspray
through the flame which results in a big ball
of fire that hits Virgil right in the face
He fires off two shots One hits the wall
another hits the sink pipe sending water
spraying
Upon getting his face fried Virgil screams and
jumps up knocking Alabama down and runs out
of the bathroom
Virgil collapses on the floor of the living
room Then he sees the sawed-off laying on
the ground He crawls toward it
Alabama in the bathroom sees where hes
heading She picks up the 45 automatic and
fires at him Its empty Shes on her feet
and into the room
He reaches the shotgun his hands grasp it
Alabama spots and picks up the bloody Swiss
army knife She takes a knife-first-running-
dive at Virgils back She hits him
He arches up firing the sawed-off into the
ceiling dropping the gun and sending a cloud
of plaster and stucco all over the room
Alabama snatches the shotgun
Arched over on his back Virgil and Alabama
make eye contact
The first blast hits him in the shoulder
almost tearing his arm off The second hits
him in the knee The third plays hell with his
chest
Alabama then runs at him hitting him in the
head with the butt of the shotgun
Ever since hes been firing its as if some
other part of her brain has been functioning
independently Shes been absent-mindedly
saying the prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi
ALABAMA

Lord make me an instrument

of Thy peace where there

is hatred let me sow love

where there is injury

pardon where there is

doubt faith where there

is despair hope where

there is darkness light

and where there is sadness

joy O Divine Master grant

that I may not so much seek

to be consoled as to

console to be understood

as to understand to be

loved as to love for it is

in giving that we receive

it is pardoning that we are

pardoned and it is in

dying that we are born to

eternal life
Clarence whos been hearing gunshots bursts
through the door gun drawn only to see
Alabama hitting a dead guy on the head with
a shotgun

CLARENCE
Honey
She continues He puts his gun away
CLARENCE

Sweetheart Cops are gonna

She continues He takes the gun away from her
and she falls to the ground She lies on the
floor trembling continuing with the downward
swings of her arms

Clarence grabs the shotgun and the cocaine
and tosses Alabama over his shoulder
