FADE IN
EXT ICELAND — DAY
TITLE CARD TWO WEEKS AGO

A Boeing CH47 Chinook flies in over the steel colored North
Atlantic Ocean inland to a stunning bay of turquoise water -
where icebergs the size of buildings topple out to sea

An enormous glacier consumes the far end of the bay We race
toward it

INT CHINOOK - DAY - CONT

This choppers outfitted with the prize gems of modern
technology - seismic detectors sonar machines metal
indicators

Men in military fatigues man the banks of equipment Make no
mistake about it - this is no sightseeing tour

KEN DOBBS 50s a brusque hard-ass stands behind the PILOTS

DOBBS
This better be good

CO-PILOT
Sir with all due respect we
wouldnt have brought you all the
way out here if we didnt think we
had something to show you sir

Smart-ass Dobbs glares Caught in a strong gust the
chopper lurches

DR JEFF GARIPOLI 42 stumbles up behind Dobbs Sinewy and
handsome in a bookish way he pats down his wild hair and
straightens his glasses He looks out the window at the
miles of icebergs in every direction

JEFF
They dont call it Iceland for
nothing do they

The chopper lurches again as it lowers flying in over the
glacier The detector on board begins to CHIME as an image
forms on the monitor

Alarmed Jeff leans in
A mass an enormous mass deep within the glacier forms on

the monitors growing larger and taking shape as the chopper
nears the actual object
JEFF
(breathless eyes on
monitor)
Oh my God

The DETECTORS go ape-shit exploding with chimes and beeps
A cacophony of mechanical NOISE -

EXT ABBY ARCHERS HOUSE SAN DIEGO CALIFORNIA - TODAY

- fades out under the familiar WHINE of an ELECTRIC GUITAR
HEARTS MAGIC MAN emanates from the stereo of a battered
Jeep parked in the driveway

Two shapely female legs stick out of the open door of the
Jeep Inside the unmistakable SOUND of TINKERING The
owner of the pantyhose model legs is fixing the stereo

The volume cranks And a Big Gulp resting on the hood
vibrates to the bass beat It skips along the surface of the
hood and slides off splattering to the ground

At the bottom of the driveway a town car stops and two SUITS
with expensive sunglasses exit They come up the drive

SUIT 1
(yelling over the
music)
Excuse me Matam Is Dr Archer

home

DR ABBY ARCHER 41 a knock out even in her dingy work
clothes climbs out of the Jeep and sizes up the Suits
Shes not surprised to see them shes dealt with this sort
before We get the impression that they have about thirty
seconds before she tells them to get the hell off her

property Best not to fuck with Dr Archer or waste her
time

ABBY
Who wants to know

SUIT 2
(pen in mouth)
Friends

SUIT 1

Suit 2 caps his pen His monogrammed pen Abby catches the
insignia ECKMANN ENTERPRISES The name resonates with her
She deftly pulls one wire from her dash and the music
abruptly stops

ABBY
You guys ever hear the one about
the boy who was hit by a car and
taken to the emergency room

Theyre not in the mood for this

ABBY

(continuing)
Come on roll with me here This
will be educational for you both

and takes one look at the boy and
says “I cant operate on him
Hes my son” But the doctor
isnt the boys father How can
this be

SUIT 2

Abby pulls the curtains watching as the said suits climb
into their waiting car

ABBY
(making up her mind)

She hangs up and bolts from the house Through the window
we watch her chase down the town car recanting her refusal

EXT ECKMANN LABORATORIES GENEVA SWITZERLAND - NIGHT

An enormous facility perched on a scenic hillside The
lights of Geneva glitter below

INT BASEMENT ECKMANN LABORATORIES - NIGHT

On the heels of two new SUITS we burst through a labyrinth
of labs - full of beakers and Bunsen burners The few
scientists here at this late hour watch the suits barrel past
like the Gestapo fearful that the men are coming for them
One guy drops a beaker SHATTERING it Relief washes over
him when the men pass him by

DOWN A LONG OVERLY LIT CORRIDOR

At the end of the hall theres a lab full of animal cages
and examining tables Inside a woman in a lab coat holds a
bunny in each hand - this is EMI DANG 28 a brilliant
biologist Chinese-American She watches the suits approach
They barge through the swinging doors Frightened the

Well-groomed goatee stylish glasses pressed pants -
Temples a hip slick and cooler version of your
quintessential engineer

TEMPLE
How do we know this wasnt built
by the Mayans

A sea of blank faces

TEMPLE
(continuing)
We know because first of all
theres no evidence that molds
were used And second there are
iron ore deposits - see here

The back doors of the lecture hall burst open - two of
Eckmanns SUITS The sight of them catches Temple off guard
For a second

TEMPLE
(continuing pointing
to the slide)
the Mayans didnt use iron in
their architecture in 600 BC did

EXT GLACIER TOP - DAY

The top of the glacier has been transformed into an
impressive military-esque outfit Row after row of army
green tents house the hundred plus men who man the state of
the art drilling machinery

Off to the side huge cranes wait to be put to use A large
hangar houses the choppers and jeeps There are even a half
dozen decked out trailers for the superiors

The air is riddled with the steady hum of DRILLING

At the far edge of the camp Dobbs and Jeff stand at the top
ef a ice shaft dug into the glacier - 30 feet across the
shaft is nearly a mile deep

An enclosed elevator car hangs over the pit suspended by an
intricate system of electric pulleys Eight men with
biohazard outfits file unto the elevator

DOBBS
Determine theres no risk clear
a path to it and get the hell out
of there Goodson You hear me

COLBY GOODSON 26 a broad shouldered Texan is in charge
Despite the elaborate bubble boy suit - we can tell hes a
looker

GOODSON
Yes sir
Dobbs gives the signal and the elevator lowers into the pit

beginning its long descent down
EXT GLACIAL SITE — DAY
Two paces behind Dobbs Jeff follows him through camp

JEFF
Id like the first shot at it
Dobbs Before the others get
here I can give Eckmann an
accurate assessment of whats down

there -

DOBBS
Youre a DNA - guy - right
Garipoli

JEFF

- geneticist Yes

DOBBS
And you think you can single-
handedly do the work of Eckmanns
experts - the worlds leading
experts in their respective
fields

Jeff doesnt even blink Hes not lacking in confidence
DOBBS
(continuing)
Youre a bigger jack-ass than I
had you pegged for Doc
A GRUNT runs up to Dobbs

CUT TO
EXT REMOTE MOUNTAIN RAIN FORESTS OF LATIN AMERICA - DAY

A truck races up a dirt road overgrown with ferns vines and
other encroaching vegetation

INT GREGOR PETROVICHS STATION - DAY

A seemingly rustic but neat room full of books and ledgers
A KETTLE WHISTLES A mans hand lifts it off the flame
Its then that the HUM of the trucks engine can be heard in
the distance Nearing A pet canary squawks in warning
hopping around its cage The man empties the kettle out on
the fire extinguishing it and exits

INT TRUCK - DAY - CONT

Through the windshield a hut can be made out perched at the
highest point of the mountain range The SUITS exchange
looks

SUIT 5
Thats got to be it

EXT GREGOR PETROVICHS STATION — DAY
They park the truck and head to the hut

From a branch overhead GREGOR PETROVICH 39 drops down
rifle cocked

Bearded dirty and obviously having been alone too long
hes like a wild animal - more like a Neanderthal than a
world-renowned scholar Of Croatian descent Gregor speaks
with an accent

GREGOR
Get on the ground

One obeys The other hesitates
il

GREGOR
(continuing)
Get on the fucking ground now or
Ill kill you

SUIT 6
Doctor Petrovich Allister Eckmann
sent us He has a project for
you In Iceland

Gregor considers this weighing out the plausibility of their
story He checks out their suits The truck It adds up

He shoots the cocked rifle into the tree anyway just to scare
the shit out of them

INT GREGORS STATION DAY

Through the open door we see Suit 5 waiting out in the
truck Inside the hut the other suit gnaws on a piece of
jerky attempting to make small talk

SUIT 6
This isnt so bad

Gregor packs his things quickly Because hes so organized
this doesnt take long

GREGOR
Its rat Wait outside Theres
something I need to do before I go

Once the Suits gone Gregor lets the canary out of her cage
She flies around the room delighted Gregor smiles Hes a
handsome man after all beneath the layers of grime and
neglect

He closes his suitcase and leaves the hut -
flipping a switch on his way out

As he walks out to the waiting truck the camera pulls back
inside We pass over the open ledgers full of intricate
drawings - ellipses and orbits

Back further we see star maps on the walls and high-powered
telescopes Expensive telescopes This hut is an
observatory

Light filters in from above as the roof retracts in a perfect
oval revealing the sky as it fades into twilight A thousand
stars glimmer overhead Gregors canary flies out the open
roof into the descending night

EXT ICELAND - DAWN

A truck with an ECKMANN ENTERPRISES insignia on the side
passes through Icelands surreal landscape - the land of fire
and ice Theres an entire valley of cooling lava And a
waterfall the size of Niagara jutting out of a mountain side
A geyser to rival Old Faithful rips through a bed of
permafrost billowing endless clouds of steam

INT TRUCK - DAWN - CONT

Out the window Abby watches the bizarre scenery pass Its
like visiting the surface of another planet Emi Dang sits
in the row behind her staring out her window

In the back row DR FRIDRICKSSON 62 an Icelandic geologist
snores lLoudly

EMI
(to Abby)
I work in the Geneva lab Which
one are you from

ABBY
I dont work for Eckmann Anymore
(changing the subject
You know who that guy is

She motions to the snoring man

EXT TURQUOISE BAY ICELAND - DAY - CONT

The truck passes over a bridge Beneath huge icebergs
scrape down the channel and out to sea

The truck stops beside the only man-made structure on the
shore of the brilliant turquoise bay - a tarmac An ECKMANN
ENTERPRISES Chinook warms up

Abby walks down to the shore of the bay An iceberg the size
of a school gymnasium SCRAPES by on its way out to sea

A tremendous GRINDING SOUND draws her attention to the parent
glacier at the far end of the bay A huge chunk of ice
breaks free from the top and plummets hundreds of feet
landing with a tremendous splash in the bay

Abby shivers involuntarily Behind her the choppers BLADES
WHIP to life

INT CHINOOK - DAY

Out the window of the chopper we see the parent glacier
fastly approaching

Emi absently traces her finger in the condensation on the
window The Icelandic geologist now fully awake yells to
be heard over the engine He lectures Abby and Emi

FRIDRICKSSON
All sorts of things get trapped in
the glaciers Things that land on
the top move to the bottom and the
things trapped on the bottom work
their way to the top Eventually
Last spring they found a German
plane from the World War II The
pilot was sitting there in the
cockpit in his Luftwaffe uniform
Even the tobacco from his
cigarettes was perfect like it was
yesterday - like time standing
still

Abby sees what Emis drawn on the window - a rudimentary
boat Self-conscious Emi wipes it clear as the chopper
begins its descent

EXT CAMP GLACIER TOP - DAY

The Chinook lands near the campsite Abby Emi and Dr
Fridricksson climb off Abby looks disapprovingly at the
rows upon rows of tents and the men in military fatigues

TEMPLE (OS)
Were back in the thick of it now
Abby old girl

Abby breaks into a smile and turns to see -

ABBY
(hugging him)
Temple I thought you quit

TEMPLE
I did Right after you
(he winks)
And now here we both are working
on one of Eckmanns projects
again

ABBY
(defiant)
Im not here for him

TEMPLE
Jeff call you in

Her silence is her confirmation A jeep of faux military men
passes

ABBY
Where does Eckmann find ail these
fake military dudes

TEMPLE
Debbs does Gun and Ammo is my
guess How much do you think the
tabloids would pay to know that
the richest man in the world
dreams of being a military
dictator

ABBY
Eckmanns one sick fuck

TEMPLE
Youfre telling me He rigged the
Troy site with hidden cameras so
he could watch us as we worked

PA SYSTEM (QS)
Testing Testing

The PA system thunders so loudly it causes drifts of snow and
ice to avalanche off the roof of the hangar

DOBBS (OS)
Lower the God-damn PA

TEMPLE
Ah The voice of Dobbs Good old
Dobbs What a fucking saint

ABBY
You seen Jeff yet

Temple nods guiltily Suspicions raised Abby looks past
him Jeff waits nearby patting down his wild hair

ABBY
(continuing)
You his goodwill ambassador
Temple

TEMPLE
Something like that
(he pats her back)
Go easy on him Abby Hes scared
shitless to see you again

ABBY
He should be

Temple heads off as Jeff nears He stops a few feet from
Abby leaving a healthy amount of distance between them

ABBY
(continuing)
I find it hard to believe that
Eckmann has enough work to keep a
geneticist employed full time
What does he have you working on
Jeff Are you making Ubermanch

JEFF
Couldnt go back to being a noble
and poor academic Can you blame
me Abby

ABBY

(to Abby)
Youve waited your whole life for
this and - Im glad you came
Abby I just hope it doesnt turn
out to be a disappointment

ABBY
Ive waited my whole life fora
lot of things Jeff that have
turned out to be shit Im use to
disappointment

She grabs her bags and heads off after the grunt
INT CONTROL ROOM COMMUNICATIONS TRAILER - DAY

This simple trailers decked out with all the amenities deep
pockets can afford - sophisticated sensory equipment an
elaborate PA system shelf after shelf of high-tech wizardry

The experts - Temple Emi Dr Fridricksson Abby and Jeff
wait A rigid GRUNT stands by the door like a guard

Temple rummages through his bag He pulls out a CD

TEMPLE
Some tunes
(eyeing the elaborate
stereo system)
I bet this baby can crank

Before he can get to the stereo the doors are thrown open
Dobbs enters followed by ALLISTER ECKMANN 56

ECKMANN
Greetings and salutations

- Eckmanns an eccentric billionaire who often behaves more
o like a petulant 4 year-old than a man of wealth and
eo distinction

Twirling the ends of his manicured mustache he scans the
room making a mental note of everyone and everything

ECKMANN
(continuing)
Sit Sit Please Ms Dang
lovely as always

He kisses her hand - she allows this but only long enough as
not to appear rude She eyes him cautiously

ECKMANN
(continuing)
Professor Jones I havent had
the pleasure of your company since
Atlantis was it

TEMPLE
Troy

ECKMANN
Troy Yes

TEMPLE

But it wasnt Troy

ECKMANN
No it was - what — a Byzantine
market was it

He chuckles good-naturedly and turns to Abby Its easy to
tell from their caustic exchange that theres no love lost
between these two

ECKMANN

(continuing)
Dr Archer What would in
expedition be like without at
least one ball buster in the group

(to Jeff)
Dr Garipoli if you can get along
with your ex-wife then I suppose
we all can learn Youre an
inspiration to us all good man

Eckmann shakes Dr Fridrickssons hand heartily welcomes him
in Icelandic and then surveys the room

ECKMANN
(continuing)
Is this it Is our group complete
Debbs

DOBBS
No Theres one more on your list
(pausing)
An astronomer

Abby looks confused

ABBY
Why would we heed an astronomer

Eckmann smiles in response The door opens and Gregor
Petrovich enters Grizzly Adams beard and all He and
Eckmann look like delegates from two different worlds but
they hug like old friends

GREGOR
I came as fast as I could

ECKMANN
Ive been looking forward to an
opportunity to work with you
again Gregor Tell me I can
persuade you to come work for me
full-time

ABBY
Bxcuse me Im sorry to break up
the man on man lovefest But
weve all flown half way around
the world to get here so that you
could show us what you think you
have found this time Eckmann
So can we get to it

ECKMANN
(twinkle in his eye)
And shes off Dobbs

Dobbs lowers the lights and the first image from the chopper
fills the TV screen A large indeterminable mass glows deep
inside the glacier

ECKMANN

(continuing)
I routinely send out what I like
to think of as Magellan
expeditions to the far corners of
the world the sole purpose to
discover that which has not been
discovered to find that which has
been overlooked

From the intonation in his voice hes deliberately making a
reference to both his pet projects and his eclectic stable
of experts

ECKMANN
(continuing)
This glacier is the largest and
oldest freestanding glacier in all
of Europe And from time to
time it coughs up some
interesting contents

Thinking of the World War II plane Abby looks to
Fridricksson

ECKMANN
(continuing)
On a routine flyby our detectors
discovered a mass deep within the
glacier

As they watch the mass grows bigger more distinct

ECKMANN
(continuing)
Approximately the width of a
football field - its a quarter of
a mile long and over a hundred
feet tall

The unmistakable shape of a boat forms onscreen

ECKMANN

(continuing)
Dobbs and his men set up camp and
have been digging down to the site
for weeks Its been a slow and
dangerous process The nature of
ice is a precarious one Theyve
had to be extremely careful but
despite our caution weve had our
share of caveins mini avalanches
and setbacks

Onscreen a hand-held shot of the expedition crew in
biohazard outfits setting off down into the glacier Jeff
and Dobbs are there in the background

ECKMANN
(continuing with
pride)

We hit target two days ago

ABBY
(quietly)
You think its Noahs Ark dont
you
ECKMANN

I was sure of it Dr Archer
Until two days ago

Eckmann signals to Dobbs who reaches in his pocket and
removes a metal bolt He tosses this on the tabletop It
skids along the surface coming to a stop in front of Abby

ECKMANN
(continuing)
When the men reached the ship
they removed that from it Do you
know what that is doctor

ABBY
(an educated guess)
A bolt

She hands it to Temple who puts on his glasses and sets to
work studying it

ECKMANN
A metal bolt And do you know
what that means Dr Archer

ABBY
(disappointed)
That youre wasting my time again

She heads for the door

JEFF
Abby

ABBY
According to the story the ark
was made of cypress wood Jeff
By primitive people If theres
a metal boat down in that glacier
I dont know what it is But its
not the Ark

GREGOR
According to the biblical story
the Ark also landed in Southern
Turkey If it -

GREGOR (contd)
r (points to the mass
on the monitors)
- is the ship the story refers to
there are obviously going to be
some serious discrepancies from
the original story

Abby offended that this - stranger - would challenge her
bites back

ABBY
I didnt realize you were an
astronomer and a Noahs Ark expert
too Please enlighten us - Im
sorry I didnt catch your name

GREGOR

Gregor Petrovich Its often
speculated that the Ark came to
rest on either Mt Ararat or Mt
Judi in southern Turkey But
despite dozens of expeditions
nothing has been found on either
Ararat or Judi to lend credence to
the story If Im not mistaken

4 Dr Archer youve lead two of

T OF those expeditions yourself With
Eckmanns funding To no avail
correct doctor
(Abby has no response)

Im no expert on the Ark Doctor
Archer Thats your speciality
But I did have a perfect
attendance record in Sunday school

ABBY

(quiet)
It cant be the ark The one
consistency in all the versions of
the story is that the Ark was made
six-thousand years ago Theres
no way any civilization then would
have had the kind of technology to
build a ship that size Out of
metal Its just not possible

ECKMANN
Thats what I thought At first

Another slide fills the screen A close-up of the bolt
Complete with a read out of its chemical composition Temple
leans in studying the results This is his area of
expertise

ECKMANN
(continuing)
We carbon-dated the bolt The
mass down there in that glacier is
six-thousand years old

Temple sees something in the chemical break down that makes
his jaw drop He takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes

TEMPLE
We know one thing for sure No
farmer and his sons made that ship

He has everyones attention

TEMPLE

(continuing)
According to the read out this
bolts made primarily of Titanium
which is a metallic element
resembling iron It’s extremely
useful because its strong and its
light and doesnt rust easily
This makes it ideal for use in the
aircraft industry But theres no
known use of it before this
century

ECKMANN
No there isnt

The room falls silent as everyone absorbs this information

ECKMANN
(continuing)
You know what else this sample has
that makes it interesting Dr
Jones

Eckmann displays the bolt
ECKMANN
(continuing)
It contains Iridium

Temple looks like hes seen a ghost Eckmann grins like PT
Barnham revealing the bearded lady

EMI
0

GREGOR
So thats why Im here

EMI
Im lost Forgive my ignorance
but my duel doctorates are in
Biology and Zoology I havent
taken inorganic chemistry since
undergrad at Vassar Whats so
interesting about Iridium

FRIDRICKSSON
The only substantial amount of
Iridium near the earths crust is
located in a thin layer traced
back to 66 million years ago
Around the time of the Extinction
of the Dinosaurs

Emi still looks lost
TEMPLE
Folks the only source of Iridium
on Earth is from meteorites

ABBY
What are you saying

JEFF
Hes saying that ship wasnt
built here Abby
The room is silent
JEFF
(continuing)
That ship flew here

The room erupts with noisy protests and bewildered
exclamations

EMI
A space ship

FRIDRICKSSON
My holy shit

Gregor readjusts himself crudely
In the ensuing chaos Abby grabs Temple

ABBY
Temple

TEMPLE
Its the only explanation that
makes sense NASA hasnt invented
a way of attaching Iridium to
Titanium Abby No one has

ABBY
Whats inside the ship Eckmann

ECKMANN
cutting the bullshit)
You tell me Thats why the six
of you are here - youre the
fewest number of people I need to
get an accurate assessment of
whats down there in that glacier

INT TRAILER GLACIER TOP NIGHT

If we didnt know better wed swear we were in the penthouse
suite of the Ritz Carlton - not dining on the surface of a
glacier The room sparkles with candle light and fine
crystal Waiters mill about

Our six experts - Abby Jeff Temple Gregor Emi and
Fridricksson sit at a mahogany banquet table Eckmann has
placed himself at the head of the table

ECKMANN
Join me in a toast

The experts raise their glasses Abby dolled up in a dress
catches Jeff looking at her He winks

ECKMANN
(continuing)
To the biggest discovery of the
2ist century And the secrets it
holds Whatever they may be

EXT TRAILER GLACIER TOP NIGHT

The experts file out of the trailer as they head to their
respective tents for the night

At the other side of the camp Abby notices a flurry of
activity at the top of the ice shaft Dobbs and his men are
over there Doing something

ABBY
What are they doing

ECKMANN
Preparations Mr Dobbs runs a
tight ship We wouldnt want any
glitches tomorrow would we doctor

Abby glares at him

ABBY
I dont owe you anything Eckmann

ECKMANN
Your opinion Thats all Im
after Dr Archer

He tips his hat and takes his leave
INT MEDICS TENT - DAWN

Abby in a flimsy hospital gown sits on the edge of the cot
An Icelandic MEDIC checks her reflexes

MEDIC
Temperatures within the glacier
will be below freezing Your
group will only have four hours
before mild hypothermia will set
in You wont notice but your
thinking will slow Your body
will slow Even your reflexes
will slowly deteriorate until you
feel yourself falling off to
sleep but it isnt sleep its
death

He hits her knee Hard She winces
ANOTHER TENT

Another MEDIC leans over Gregor listening to his heart
Satisfied he puts his stethoscope away

MEDIC
You pass

Gregor runs his hands over his stubble

GREGOR
Do you have a razor

EXT ICE SHAFT GLACIER TOP - DAWN

A storm brews The glacier surface is a sea of blinding snow
flurries

Abby Jeff Emi Temple and Fridricksson crowd around the top
of the ice shaft as Dobbs supervises the loading of the
elevator car

The unrelenting wind threatens to blow them over Bundled up
with their light equipped helmets they look like zealous
Eskimo miners Abby leans over the ice ledge and peers into
the depths of the shaft

GOODSON (0S)
You dont want to do that maam
This wind will knock you on your
ass faster than a horny bull

He grabs her by her backpack and pulls her away from the
ledge Abby looks at the strapping young Texan

DOBBS
People Goodson will be your
escort

Goodson smiles at Abby - the kind of smile that has left a
thousand broken hearts in its wake

ABBY
You do have a permission slip from
your mother right

INTEXT ELEVATOR CAR - DAY - CONT
They open the door to the elevator car and pile in

GOODSON
We all here

The straggler as usual Gregor makes his way from the camp
to the edge of the shaft escorted by Eckmanns men

Cleaned up Gregor is a looker - chiseled jaw dashing
eyes - matinee idol good looks Abby does a double take
Jeff notices She notices that he notices

ABBY
(to Goodson)
What about Eckmann

GOODSON
Mr Eckmanns staying topside
maam

ABBY

That chickenshit

GREGOR
(entering catching
Abbys comment)
Eckmanns a great philanthropist

ABBY
Hes a showman

GREGOR
Hes a visionary - a modern-day
Carnegie -

ABBY
You his publicist

He moves past her into the car and finds a seat

GREGOR
No His friend

Dobbs seals the door and the car begins its descent
INT ELEVATOR CAR - DAY
The light of day fades with every jerky descent

JEFF
Its going to fall

GOODSON
No Its safe

The car lurches then abruptly stops The lights go out
Fridricksson starts swearing or praying we cant tell its
in Icelandic

GOODSON
(continuing)
Dont panic

The auxiliary lights come on Gregor stands by the open
circuit box with his Swiss Army knife screwdriver extended

JEFF
Look whos the closet boy scout

GREGOR
Eagle scout

The main lights come on and the car resumes its descent
Fridricksson stops swearing Abby hands him a hanky to wipe
his sweaty brow

FRIDRICKSSON
Thank you
TEMPLE
to Emi)

Were you on the Dead Sea Scrolls

EMI
No Roswell

TEMPLE
Thats right I knew you looked
familiar You been working for
Eckmann a long time

Abby steals a glance at Temple Familiar with his game He
ignores her

EMI
Long enough -

The lights go out but the car continues its steady descent
EMI
(continuing)
- to expect the unexpected
INT GLACIER - NIGHT
Pitch black and silent
Then the steady whir of the elevator car descending And
with it - floodlights It slows to a stop as it hits the
bottom of the ice shaft

From a distance we watch the seven exit their helmet lights
sweep the foggy bottom like headlights

INSIDE ABBYS HELMET

Her breath fogs the visor of her helmet She turns a corner
Something looms ahead in the dark Pitch black Mammoth -

EXT ARK - NIGHT — CONT

- in the dim light its hard to make out what it is

But as the experts gather the light from their helmets and
flashlights add to Abbys shining in the same direction and

soon the ark takes shape before us

Its immense Encrusted in ice Ominous

Goodson sets up a floodlight The dense ice encompassing the
ark reflects back thick distorted images like a fun house
mixror Abby stares in silence

Jeff lets loose a celebratory yell Fridricksson quickly
shushes him

FRIDRICKSSON
No loud noises Your antics could
cave in the roof and kill us all

Like little kids Jeff and Temple jog to the ark They can
barely contain their excitement

Abby hangs back with the others Staring at this wonder with
caution

GOODSON
This way

EXT ARK - DAY

He leads them to a portal door in the side of the ship Abby
looks at the sheets of impenetrable ice that cover the
majority of the ship But not this door

ABBY
Whos been inside the ship

GOODSON
No one We cleared the portal
door on the first expedition We
had to confirm there was no
biohazard

ABBY
And theres not

GOODSON
No maam

ABBY
How can you be sure if you didnt
board

GOODSON
We ran all the appropriate tests
maam

She reaches her hand towards the door It sparks Goodson
grabs her wrist

GOODSON
(continuing)
You dont want to do that The
doors electrically charged
Watch this

He holds his palm up to a round sensor at the side of the
door and the circular portal door whips open instantaneously
Temple investigates the palm reader

TEMPLE
What is that

GOODSON
A palm reader Beats the old crow
bar and lever routine
TEMPLE
(fascinated)
It responds to a human hand

GOODSON
Yes sir We lucked out

With that he starts his stop watch And a four hour count
down begins Goodson climbs through the open portal door
Abby goes next crossing the threshold into the ark

INT ARK DAY - CONT

Somewhere deep within the dark bowels of the ship an ancient
light flickers to life -

dimly blinking under layers of dust the light grows more
intense

Some ancient mechanism has been triggered
Some process set into motion
INT ROTUNDA ARK -— DAY — CONT

Our group climbs up the initial passageway into the rotunda
of the ark

A cavernous space eerily green the rotunda opens all the
way to the top of the ship The rooms bone chilling cold
and quiet Wot even the sound of wind

FRIDRICKSSON
Wow

Abby casts her light around Everywhere corridors lead off
the rotunda like spokes from the center of a wheel

In the center of a room a spiral staircase rises into the
darkness
Abby takes a step towards it Something crackles under her
foot She casts her light down Still not able to make it
out she crouches down
And then sees it
Shit
Bird shit
JEFF
(quiet in awe

Abby

She turns to him but his gaze is solidly fixed on something
above He pales

She shines her flashlight up into the rotunda

There perched on the high rafters above is an owl Or what
resembles an owl in attack position Frozen dead
perfectly preserved She gasps

The others shine their flashlights overhead Their lights
illuminate the rafters

Full of petrified birds All dead all frozen All staring

ABBY
Oh my God

INT ROTUNDA ARK -— DAY - LATER

A bright floodlight is set up And like Platos cave the

elongated shadows of the experts play on the walls as they
inspect the rotunda and the birds overhead Goodson shines
his light on a frozen dove stark white

GOODSON
(on the radio)
Thats what Im telling you sir
yes -

INT CONTROL ROOM COMMUNICATIONS TRAILER GLACIER TOP -

GOODSON (OS)
- there are animals on this ship

Eckmann grabs the radio mike from Dobbs

ECKMANN
Tell me how are the experts
reacting

GOODSON (0S)
Well theyre shocked sir With
good reason

But Eckmann doesnt need Goodsons commentary Hes got a
birds eye view No pun intended

The communications trailers rigged with monitors displaying
the images from various stationary cameras set up in the ark
Eckmann watches his experts canvas the rotunda

ECKMANN
(to Dobbs)
Wheres the sound I want to hear
them I found the real deal this
time By God I did

Dobbs orders his men to activate the audio

GOODSON (OS)
Sir

INT ROTUNDA ARK - DAY - CONT

GOODSON
I didnt catch that

ECKMANN (0S)
Keep up the good work son

With that radio contact is disconnected

Goodson looks around Six flashlights illuminate various
nooks and crannies off the main room as the experts head off
on their own

GOODSON
Everyone Hey Can yall come
back here for a minute Weve got
a lot of space to cover in four
hours Lets split up into two
groups

TEMPLE
Tll take Emi
(this sounds really
forward)
And Jeff

Fridricksson looks at him like the last kid on the playground
Td waiting to be picked for kickball

TEMPLE
(continuing)
And Fridricksson

GOODSON
Fine Then Dr Archer Dr
Petrovich and I will be the other
team Im channel one on the
radio Topsides channel four

Goodson hands the extra radio to Jeff who jogs off after his
crew they head to the back of the ship

JEFF
(departing)
Its the real deal Abby I told
you

Abby looks up into the rafters Her flashlight catches the
reflection of a hawks frozen gaze Piercing

GREGOR
Abby

r She jumps Turning
Gregor presses a palm reader on the wall and the door whips

open revealing a long dark corridor heading towards the
front of the ship Gregor smiles Intoxicated with the

technology
GREGOR
(continuing)
This technology is six-thousand
years old
GOODSON

Dr Petrovich youre like a two
year-old on Christmas morning

More excited about the box then
the red fire truck that came in it

INT ANOTHER CORRIDOR OFF ROTUNDA ARK - DAY

A portal door whips open Flashlights - four flashlights
Group two enters and makes their way down the long corridor
Fridricksson spots something out of the corner of his eye
He turns shining his light

There are two frozen marsupiallooking animals

Like a cross between a koala and an armadillo they stand
against the wall Next to it there crouch two felines
Larger than house cats their whiskers extend to the floor
Emi grabs Fridrickssons arm

EMI
Theres two of each

Everywhere odd incarnations of familiar animals with
prehistoric anomalies are cast into light and then back into
complete darkness as the flashlights pass over them

Like a visit to the prehistoric taxidermist rows of animals
stack all the way to the high ceiling lining both sides of
the hall Like bookshelves

INT NURSERY ARK DAY

A dark room Bitterly cold and quiet Goodson Gregor and
Abby shine their flashlights

Like a laboratory the rooms full of counter space and
shelves - all empty Small clear containers everywhere -
empty too Abby lays her hand on the counter It slides

Gregor shines his light on her glove Its covered with a
thick goopy substance

ABBY
Why isnt it frozen What is it

GREGOR
I dont know But you dont want
it near your skin

He grabs his hanky and wipes her glove clean Abby takes
note of the gentleness he exercises He catches her
watching She looks at the empty shelves

A room of empty shelves and goop Abbys suspicions are‘
raised

ABBY
It looks like its been looted

GOODSON (0S)
Lets get a move on it guys

Goodson enters the next room Quickly Gregor wraps the
soiled hanky in a plastic bag and puts it in his backpack

GOODSON (0S)
(continuing)
Come on now You dont go to the
prom to stand by the punch bowl

Abby follows Gregor out of the room As she goes she spots
something on the floor in the far corner of the room She
shines her flashlight over

A boot print
EXT HANGAR GLACIER TOP - DAY
CLOSE ON

Combat boots at a fast clip walking across the glacier top
to the hangar

Two other people follow in tennis shoes They slip and slide
on the icy surface trying to keep up with owner of the boots

Hangar door Two quick raps One solid one
The door slides open
INT HANGAR - DAY - CONT

Dobbs enters Followed by SIMS and WELSH two lab geeks in
wind-breakers and tennis shoes With the exception of the
guard posted at the door the vacuous hangar seems deserted

Dobbs leads them to the far corner Behind a man-made wall
of boxes and supplies there are two dozen tables set up like
a cafeteria Tarps lay out over the tables

Off to the side a makeshift lab has been set up

SIMS
(shivering)
Is it possible to get some space
heaters

WELSH
And Jolt
(explaining)
It has four times the caffeine of
regular soda

DOBBS
We need your preliminary analysis
ASAP

SIMS

Where are the samples

Dobbs pulls back the tarp of the first table

This tabletop like the dozen others is covered with test
tubes Sims and Welsh take in the sight Table after table
of embryonic fetuses in various stages of gestation
Thousands and thousands of animal embryos

DOBBS
Get to work

INT BACK CORRIDORS ARK - DAY
CLOSE ON SOME SORT OF MAMMAL

Like a cross between a bear and a dog The mother animal
lies three pups nursing All perfectly frozen Emi
crouches in front of it

Temple kneels next to her inadvertently startling her

EMI
You scared me

TEMPLE
Sorry

He reaches forward and touches the smooth skin of a pup

EMI
Theres no way to account for the
condition theyre in I mean
theyre in perfect condition

Jeff and Fridricksson join them looking at the nursing pups

FRIDRICKSSON
Poor little guys

Reverently he looks overhead at the hundreds and hundreds of
animals stacked up into the darkness

FRIDRICKSSON
(continuing to Emi)
What could account for a death
toll like this

EMI
A sudden change in pressure
(losing confidence)
Possibly

TEMPLE
What I want to know is why arent
there pens or crates around the
animals

No one has an answer

JEFF
Maybe there were electric fences
At one point

TEMPLE
(not convinced)
Maybe

Temple sits down and starts examining the floor and walls
Jeff squats beside him sweeping away layers of dust

Fridricksson and Emi are antsy to move on

FRIDRICKSSON
Maybe it would be best if Ms Dang
and IT went ahead and continued to
look at the animals Then the
two of you could take as much time
as you want looking at the floor

Temples surprised the two of them are uninterested

TEMPLE
Suit yourselves

Emi mouths the words thank you to Fridricksson and they
head off Temple watches them go Or more specifically
watches Emi go

JEFF
You like her

TEMPLE
Ive heard Eckmanns laboratory in
Geneva is top notch Perhaps with
the right motivation I could be
persuaded to leave academia and
get on Eckmanns payroll again

JEFF
(offended)
If finding a comfortable
environment in which to pursue
your life’s work is a crime than
I guess Im guilty -

TEMPLE
Look I didnt mean anything by
it Jeff Really Sorry

deff resumes his work clearing the floor

JEFF
There are worse things then
working for Eckmann you know -

Temple gingerly moves the pups aside
TEMPLE
(making a joke)
Yeah You could be working for
Dobbs
DOWN THE CORRIDOR
Fridricksson and Emi come to a fork in the passageway
EMI
Why dont we split up Well
cover more space
FRIDRICKSSON
I dont know if thats a good
idea Ms Dang
EMI
(turning on the charm)
Emi
FRIDRICKSSON
Emi Its a labyrinth in here
One could easily get lost -

EMI
Ill leave a trail of bread crumbs

Fridricksson consents and they part ways Each heading down
their own corridor

Goodson sets it up and the room fills with light

A large contoured console without instrumentation of any kind
sits before them

Gregor charges to it scanning it up and down

Eckmann leans forward in his seat so excited he can barely
contain himself

GREGOR (0S)

This could be tangible proof of
extra-terrestrial life

Its possible that this was made
here on earth by a culture far
more advanced than ours

INT FLIGHT DECK ARK -— DAY - CONT

ABBY
Now extinct

GREGOR
No - the material the technology
the design - it all points to
space travel Its pure arrogance
to maintain that it must have a
human origin

GOODSON
Both explanations sound equally
stupid if you ask me

They both turn on him eyes blazing

GOODSON
(continuing)
Which you didnt

INT CONTROL ROOM GLACIER TOP - DAY - CONT

Eckmanns glued to the set waiting to watch the fireworks
show when suddenly the monitors cut out Nothing but static

ECKMANN
Dobbs Where are you Hurry

EXT GLACIER TOP - DAY - CONT

A doozy of a storm has blown in The winds threaten to wipe
their camp off the glacier Dobbs yells orders to his men
who scurry about trying to resurrect antennas and blown over
equipment

INT FLIGHT DECK ARK - DAY

GREGOR
Let me get this straight we find
a six-thousand year-old ship full
of prehistoric animals and you
dont think its Noahs Ark
ABBY
Noahs Ark is the genesis of all
current life Everything on board
this ship is dead

GREGOR
We dont know that they all died
The animals left could be the
stragglers

ABBY
And where did the survivors go
Out into the ice Nothing could
live out there

GREGOR
Abby there are only three
necessities for life Light
Heat And liquid water Our
solar system alone has four
celestial objects that have the
necessary ingredients — Earth
Mars Europa and Venus

ABBY
there you go again -

GREGOR
Hear me out Please

He takes a minute to compose himself

GREGOR
(continuing)

Its not plausible that this ship
came from outside our solar
system The travel time would
have been too leng to make such a
trip likely So it leaves one of
the four in our solar system as
the likely suspect Venus and
Mars are out - Venus is and most
likely has always been too hot to
sustain life Mars did produce
micro-organisms but the
atmosphere is too weak for
anything more substantial Which
leaves Earth - your theory But
then why the need for a titanium
space ship huh

Abby doesnt have an answer

GREGOR
(continuing)

Europa is the smallest of the four
Galilean satellites which orbit
Jupiter - Europas equivalent to
the size of our own moon Its
covered with a thick layer of ice
but underneath the ice there are
oceans 100 kilometers deep

GOODSON
A flooded planet

GREGOR
Yes a flooded planet What earth
would look like if the flood
waters had never receded

ABBY
Tf Europas covered with ice it
would have been too cold to
sustain life

GREGOR
Not so Jupiter emits heat
Nearly twice as much as it
receives from the sun And light
Europa has the necessary
ingredients Liquid water heat
and light Its entirely
plausible

ABBY
That life originated on this moon
of Jupiters And that these
people made a space ship and
left when their planet flooded

GREGOR
Yes They left and came here

ABBY
The bible says they were on the
boat for a year -

GOODSON
(correcting her)
forty days and forty nights

ABBY
No there were forty days and
forty nights of rain They were
on the ark for a year

GREGOR
If it came from Europa they would
have had to pass through the
asteroid belt between Jupiter and
Mars

GOODSON
Well that rules it out They
would have been hit by an asteroid

GREGOR
Not so The belt consists of
mostly tiny rocks and dust Which
coming in contact with the ship
wouldve sounded -

ABBY
- like rain

GOODSON
(freaked out)
Okay thats enough of this

He slams his hand on the flight deck console They turn

GOODSON
(continuing)
No more There will be time
enough to discuss your “theories”
when we get topside

Both Gregor and Abby stare in his direction wide-eyed
Thinking hes succeeded in getting their attention Goodson
straightens his already impeccable posture

GOODSON
(continuing)
But while were down here I think
our time is best spent gathering
information -

Abby points past him Both she and Gregor are rendered
speechiess

Goodson turns

Glowing behind him is a huge hologram of the ship - several
areas including the rotunda are lit in a brilliant blue

GOODSON
(continuing)
What the hell

As they watch regions of the ship change colors - from white
to baby blue from baby blue to cornflower blue

GREGOR
The ships running on its own
Somethings going on

GOODSON
We need to tell Dobbs

He grabs his radio Nothing but static

GOODSON
(continuing)
Topside Can you read me Come
in

He tries another channel and another

GOODSON
(continuing)
I cant get a clear line up

Gregor steps forward and takes the radio from Goodson

GREGOR
Its probably this room I11
head back towards the rotunda
until I can find a clean channel
(points to hologram)
You two stay here and try to
figure out what that means

Abbys already on it In fact shes in the middle of it -
staring in fascination at the intricacies of the map
Goodson joins her and they walk through the ship

Behind them unnoticed by both the rotunda of the hologram
goes from a cornflower blue to deep dark red

INT BACK CORRIDORS ARK - DAY

Jeff and Temple finish clearing the floorboard beneath the
mama creature

It looks like black marble but then -

faint lines of color glow beneath the opaque surface The
floorboards a complex circuit board of some kind

JEFF
What is it

TEMPLE
I dont know But Im not sure I
like the looks of it

He steals a glance at the rows and rows of ferocious
prehistoric creatures

INT NURSERY ARK DAY

GREGOR (OS)
Hello Topside do you copy

Nothing but static in response

Gregor makes his way through the labyrinth of adjoining rooms
and halls He tries to radio again

GREGOR
Topside Hello can you hear me

INT ROTUNDA ARK DAY - CONT
Were looking from the rafters down on the cavernous rotunda
Below Gregor enters
GREGOR
on radio)
Dobbs
(static tries again)
Can you hear me Anyone

In frustration he throws the radio to the ground It lies
there emitting its steady stream of static

A noise from above What sounds like -

- a flap

And again The SOUND of a solitary wing flapping
Gregor freezes in place

High above the rafters glow dimly - a deep hot red He
shines his flashlight up

Perched on a rafter -

- an owl carefully cocks its head to the side and looks at
him Blinks Then flaps its wings trying them out

Gregor watches as it takes flight and circles the top of the
rotunda A hawk joins it and a crow

GREGOR
(continuing)
Oh my God

Amazed he watches these dead birds swoop around the
rotunda and then fly off down various corridors

One particularly menacing falcon spots him on the floor of
the rotunda It lets loose a blood curdling SCREECH and
dives down

Preparing to attack

Gregor snaps to attention He grabs the radio transmitter
and runs

His sudden movement draws the attention of the other birds
They dive in pursuit

INT BACK CORRIDORS ARK - DAY

On their hands and knees Jeff and Temple investigate the
floorboard A floodlight illuminates their work The SOUND
of MOVEMENT off-screen

TEMPLE
Whats that

It sounds like a train approaching
TEMPLE
(continuing)
What the fuck is that

Alarmed Jeff grabs Temple and scoots into the mama
creatures lair

Faces pressed against the floorboard they wait
The SOUND grows closer

Through the open portal door at the end of the corridor a
flock of birds approaches

The birds race down the hall in formation as if in pursuit of
some prey As they fly past the floodlight their shadows
race by on the wall These are some freaky fangled looking
creatures

Even their shadows are terrifying
TEMPLE

(continuing)
Jesus

Jeff clamps his hand over Temples mouth as the birds pass
They race down the hall like bats

Turning a corner they head off down a new corridor and then -
- theyre gone
Temple wrestles out of Jeffs grip

TEMPLE
(continuing panicked)
What the fuck was that

All of a sudden the floorboard beneath the mama creature
glows a rosy pink color Its not the only one Up and down
the corridor the floorboards light up

JEFF
Oh my God
(realizing)
Temple I dont think these
animals are dead

TEMPLE
What do you mean

JEPF
I think theyre cyrogenic
Frozen Very much alive

Temple looks at the rows of animals stretching up into the
darkness of the ship

TEMPLE
Theyve been here for six-thousand
years Thats not possible

JEFF
Look any civilization advanced
enough to build a space ship that
makes NASA look like it
manufactures Matchbox cars is
definitely capable of building a
cryogenic process elaborate enough
to sustain life indefinitely

TEMPLE
How How is it sustaining life
You see any tubes Any
ventilators

Temple motions to the empty space between the animals the
way theyre just suspended in animation

The floorboards glow brighter - illuminating the frozen
stares of the ferocious creatures

JEFF
(quiet)
Through the floorboards

TEMPLE
What

JEFF
I think it happens through the
floorboards

Jeff pulls out his radio

JEFF
(continuing)
Abby Abby Do you copy Hella
(static)
Fuck
TEMPLE

Listen to me Were getting the
hell off this ship Ill find Emi
and Fridricksson You get Abby

and the others
JEFF

Maybe we should just get out now
Get to the top and send
reenforcements

TEMPLE
Listen to me Jeff Find them
And meet me at the elevator car
Ill bring the others Okay

Jeff nods

TEMPLE
(continuing)
Okay

They split up Jeff runs towards the rotunda Temple heads
down the corridor flanked on either side by hundreds of
freakish creatures that glow in the pinkish red light from
the floorboards

INT FLIGHT DECK ARK - DAY

Abby familiarizes herself with the layout of the ship via the
hologram She points to a large room on the sixth floor

ABBY
It looks like this is the main
computer Up here on the sixth
floor

Goodson half listens hes deep in thought Brow pinched

GOODSON
Dr Archer Say Petrovich is

right and us humans are actually
aliens that came from somewhere
else

ABBY
Its all completely hypothetical
Goodson

GOODSON

Yeah What I cant figure out is
if they we were smart enough to
build this thing six thousand
years ago and everything then what
happened

ABBY
Say theres some validity to what
Dr Petrovich is saying these
people wouldve landed here
without any infrastructure to
support thelr advanced technology

He looks confused

ABBY
r (continuing)
They wouldnt have had electricity
or anything They would have
had to camp out make fire build
shelter live off the land Basic
survival stuff

GOODSON
Like cave people

ABBY
Within a few generations the
story of a ship coming from one of
the dots in the night sky - can
you imagine - it wouldve sounded
preposterous —

GOODSON
But a boat People couldve
believed that

ABBY
Its hypothetical Goodson

A LOUD BEEPING emanates from his pants Confused Abby
stares at his beeping crotch

ABBY
(continuing)
What the hell is that

GOODSON
My receptor

ABBY
Your what

He reaches into his pants Abby takes a step back He
fishes around finally pulling a small pager-like item from
his underwear

ABBY
(continuing)
Why the hell do you keep that in
with your nads

Ignoring her Goodson reads the message displayed on the
receptor

GOODSON
Theyre having transmission
difficulties up top Not to be
alarmed If radio contacts not
re-established by the time we
leave we can activate the car
manually and it will take us to
the top

Goodson types in a response
GOODSON
(continuing)
Copy

He replaces the receptor back in his pants He changes his
mind under Abbys intent gaze and puts it in his pocket
instead When he looks up he pales as he looks past Abby
They have a visitor

A huge predatory bird flies through the open portal door
Silently

It sizes up Goodson and Abby Then opening its jaw it
bears down on Abby Fangs bared

She ducks inside the hologram Bad idea The bird chases
her through the ship

She jumps over the console The bird follows gaining on
her It flies up preparing to dive-bomb her SCREECHING

A SHOT RINGS out

And the birds face registers its surprise Dead it falls
on Abby She pushes it off Freaked out

Goodson rushes to her side holstering his weapon

GOODSON
(continuing)
you all right

She scoots backwards pointing

Across the room theres another bird racing on a collision
course with the back of Goodsons head

Goodson turns in time to see it closing in Like a
gunslinger he pulls his gun out and catches the thing right
between the eyes

That done he hurdles the console and rolls across the room
Slamming his hand on the palm reader the portal door whips
shut

Exhausted both he and Abby catch their breath Abby leans
against the console Goodson slumps his back to the door

ABBY
Youre not a fake military dude
are you Goodson

He looks at her contemplates lying decides against it

GOODSON
No maam Im not

ABBY
Thank God

INT FRONT CORRIDORS ARK — DAY

in the impenetrable darkness The SOUND of dripping water
The ceiling oozes

got to get off this ship

He hears something ahead Alarmed he stops
JEFF

(continuing)
Abby

No answer He searches his person What does he have to
protect himself

SOUND of MOVEMENT Somethings around the corner

A pen A lousy pen is all Jeff can find He uncaps it and
holds it out in front of him like a weapon - a small
ineffectual weapon but better than no weapon at all

He braces himself and jumps out - at least hell have the
element of surprise

Quicker than he can tell whats happening hes placed in a
merciless headlock a screwdriver at his neck Hes released
just as suddenly and falls to his knees

Mens shoes He looks up Gregor

GREGOR

his breath)

Youre the fucker

GREGOR

Jeff notices that Gregor has turned his flashlight into a
bonafide torch It lights Gregors face Like a cavemans

Gregor shushes him lifting him to his feet
More NOISES
Jeff holds out the pen as if it were a shunt Gregor sees it
for what it is - puny ineffectual - he grabs it out of
Jeffs hand

Then using his the light from his torch Gregor looks around
the corner

the hallway floor is a sea of scuttling and slithering as
serpents and rodents scurry about

A sizable rat chews its way through a snake to the baby rat
it swallows The big rat eats the little one Unapologetic
cannibalism

Gregor hucks the pen as far down the hall as he can The
grotesque creatures dart after it slithering and scurrying
in that direction

Wielding the torch Gregor leads Jeff down the hall

INT CONTROL ROOM GLACIER TOP - DAY

Seated at the console Dobbs discreetly deletes Goodsons SOS
message that appears on the screen

A frantic Eckmann leans in

ECKMANN
What was that

DOBBS
System error sir No news

Disappointed Eckmann turns away Dobbs removes a jimmy from
the console Effectively shutting the machine off

DOBBS
(continuing)
Sir the whole systems gone down

Fuming Eckmann slams his hand on the counter
INT FLIGHT DECK ARK - DAY
Goodson taps another message into his receptor

GOODSON
No answer

ABBY
(inspects the console)
Keep trying

GOODSON
Those birds - maybe we disturbed
their secret mating location or
something

ABBY
Come on Goodson Those birds are
not indigenous to Iceland or
anywhere else on this fucking
planet

GOODSON
One encounter with a Flintstone
bird and youre starting to sound
like Petrovich

Abby ignores the dig She turns her attention to the
hologram Almost all the quadrants are lit now and glowing
brighter by the minute

Suddenly the portal door whips open

In the blink of an eye Goodson has his gun out and cocked
Abby braces herself

Its Jeff and Gregor

ABBY
Christ He almost took your head
off
GREGOR
(to Jeff)

Tell them what you told me

Jeff stares in awe at the hologram

JEFF
Holy shit

Gregor pinches him

JEFF

(continuing)
The back of the arks full of
animals stacked up like something
out of a demented taxidermist
But there arent any pens or
anything else to keep them
separate - which is crazy because
those animals would just as soon
rip each other to shreds than rub
elbows

Abby and Goodson look at him blankly - get to the point

JEFF
(continuing)
The floorboard I dont know how
it works but I think it’s been
keeping these animals alive
through some sort of process of
cryogenic osmosis

ABBY
Osmosis

JEFF
Molecular suspension Atomic
intermission Electron
intercession Call it what you
want Abby I dont know how it
works okay All I know is that
those animals back there arent
dead Theyre not dead

Abby and Goodson need only look to the downed birds for
confirmation of this

GOODSON
Weve lost contact with topside
but we can manually reset the
elevator Where are the others

JEFF
Temple went to get them

GOODSON
You were supposed to stay together

JEFF
Read me the riot act later
Goodson Okay

ABBY
Whats that

Abby climbs onto the console inspecting something nestled in
the crook of ceiling

GREGOR
Be careful Abby

CLOSE ON HIDDEN VIDEO CAMERA

ABBY
That son of a bitch

She yanks it from the wall
It takes Gregor a moment to process this -

GREGOR
You think Eckmann put that there

ABBY
You think your alien friends had
Panasonic Camcorders

She holds it out so that he can read the brand insignia
Goodson steps forward accepting responsibility

GOODSON
Eckmann had us install them so
that he could see your faces when
you discovered the animals

ABBY
That sick fuck
to camera)
You sick sick fuck

GOODSON
He didnt know they were alive
We all thought they were dead
They looked dead —

ABBY
So much for an uncontaminated
environment What else did your
crew do while you were on the ark
Goodson

JEFF
Abby No one could have
anticipated this Its
inconceivable

GOODSON
(miserably)
We didnt know they were alive

GREGOR
That explains how theyre waking
so quickly Your crew must have
tripped some sort of alarm when
you came on board the first time
Theres no other way to account
for how quickly theyre thawing

Gregor stares at the hologram with all its many colors Abby
motions to the red color of the rotunda

ABBY
The red sections - are the active
ones I think

As they watch a handful of other quadrants turn red but the
majority of the ship remains in shades of blue

GREGOR
We might still have time to turn
it off Whatever process is doing
this

ABBY
There must be manual controls
somewhere

JEFF
Are you out of your mind We
need to get the fuck out of here
Now

GREGOR
Jeff if what you said is true and
The arks full of these animals -
theyre going to rip each other to
shreds Theyll be nothing left
to study Id think you of all
people would want to preserve as
many of them as we can Save the
genetic material

JEFF
Id rather save my ass Our lives
are in danger here bucko
Serious danger Fuck preserving
the animals

ABBY
But there may be some simple way
to reverse the process -

JEFF
- You havent seen what Ive seen
back there in this ark Abby
These are no fuzzy kitty-cats
These creatures will rip your
fucking head off and ask for
seconds

GREGOR
Leave if you want But Im going
to find a way to freeze them back
up This is the find of the
century

ABBY
Tll help

GOODSON
No Dr Garipolits right Were
aborting this mission No more
discussion

Goodson heads to the door reloading his gun

GOODSON
(continuing)
Ive got four shots left Which
Means that -

He scans the flight deck with the eyes of a Green Beret

GOODSON
(continuing)
- were not going out there until
weve ransacked this place and
taken every God-damn McGyver
paperclip we can get our hands on
for defense

They start to search the flight deck and the
frantically

adjoining rooms

Unobserved dozens of rooms in the hologram shift from a
light blue to a deep cornflower blue as they go through the
stages of thawing

In the back of the ark a whole row of rooms shifts from blue
to red

Deep red

INT BACK ROOM ARK DAY

CLOSE ON A SHINY PAIR OF NEEDLE-NOSE PLIERS

An ecstatic Emi Dang crouches in front of a cougar-esque
creature She removes a tuft of fur and puts it ina
surgical baggy

The ceiling of the room towers six floors above Between her
and the rafters there are row upon row upon row of
carnivorous animals

She leans forward Almost face to face with the cougar She
squints as she inspects it Using the pliers she yanks out
a whisker As she pulls it off the creature -

- the cougar raises its lip in a tiny snarl

But she doesnt notice Shes busy fishing in her knapsack
for a plastic baggy for her new specimen

A NOISE across the aisle

She whips around

Nothing Then -

- the lowest almost undetectable sound

A GROWL

She freezes Petrified

The rooms alive with the SOUND of RUSTLING

She watches as the rows of animals wake from their cryogenic
slumber A twitch here a blink there

Its a sight to behold
She opens her mouth but there are no words
The GROWLING intensifies coming in now from all directions

Shes surrounded

Suddenly the cougar thrusts forward and lets loose a
terrible menacing snarl right in her face
She SCREAMS

And springs to her feet Behind her a creature reminiscent
of a furry armadillo snaps at her HISSING

She jumps back

The cougar swats at her leg Stepping off its floorboard it
stalks her

She backs up

Behind her we see the shadows of various wolves and other
dog-like creatures climbing off their floorboards packing up

Unaware she retreats backwards in their direction

The cougar closes in

A GROWL from behind She turns

The pack of wolves nears barring their fangs

But shes got a more immediate problem -

The cougar pounces

Emi grabs hold of the upper shelf and pulls herself up

The cougar lunges straight into the pack of wolves They
savagely attack it

Emi hoists herself on to the ledge and scoots in as far as
she can Her helmet light reflects the eyes of something

It darts forward and licks her Tasting her

She screams

And jumps off the ledge landing on top of the pile of
snapping dogs They rip the cougar to pieces One wolf nips
her ankle

She takes off down the corridor

One wolf abandons the pack and gives chase

It gains on her

She picks up her pace sprinting toward the safety of the
next portal

It looks like shell make it

But then something short and hairy and speedy darts out in
front of her

Shes moving too fast to avoid it She trips
Lands on all fours She struggles to her feet
But the wolfs upon her

It sinks its teeth into her taut calve muscle Ripping the
tendon out

She crawls on Determined to get to the portal

The hairy creature bites the wolfs hindquarters not deterred
by the latters obvious advantage in size and prowess The
wolf turns on the thing goes for its jugular

Seizing this opportunity Emi pulls herself and her lame leg
to the portal She reaches up but is a foot shy of
activating the palm reader She hoists herself up on her
damaged leg She cries out in agony and falls back down

The wolf having ripped the hairy thing in two chunky pieces
focuses its attention again on Emi Growling the hairs on
its back raise up It slinks down the hall closing in

Ignoring her crippling pain Emi forces herself up and
activates the palm reader

The door shoots open

The wolf lunges

INTEXT NEXT CORRIDOR DAY — CONT

Emi hops through the door and slams her palms up and down
both walls hoping to locate and activate the palm reader
before -
Airborne the wolf aims for her neck Jaws opened

The portal door whips shut in the blink of an eye -

- severing the wolf in two

Its head and upper body fall to the ground with a thump
landing next to Emis shredded leg

A putrid yellow substance leaks out of the wolfs open mouth
and down the wall of the portal door

Emi scoots away She shines her helmet light around this new
foreign passageway frantically looking for predators

But there are no animals in this oblong shaped room No
floorboards either And its completely silent Only the
sound of her labored breathing

She leans her head back against the wall Her helmet light
shines into the towering heights of the room illuminating a
narrow spiral staircase that rises all the way to the top of
the ship

INT ANOTHER AREA BACK OF ARK - DAY

A portal door whips open and Fridricksson enters Leaving
the door open behind him he saunters down the aisle

On either side of him strange furry farm-like creatures sit
on the floorboards

From the looks of these creatures they could be the
relatives of our more friendly domesticated species - one
looks like a wool covered donkey another a rabbit the size
of a beagle

Fridricksson marvels at the peculiar two-legged sheepostrich
birds

Across the aisle the pigs although they look more like
manatees lie on their bellies with tiny ineffectual legs

He looks at their plight sympathetically Behind him the
ostriches flinch moving their heads from side to side But
by the time Fridricksson turns back theyre motionless
again like statues

UP IN THE RAFTERS

The birds of prey eye Fridricksson carefully strategically
planning their attack

GROUND FLOOR

Fridricksson shivers involuntarily To comfort himself he
hums as he looks around He spots handles on the walls

A SCREAM offscreen echoes down the long hall He stops in
place

And the birds move in
Diving down they try to peck out his eyes One bird

succeeds digging its beak deep into Fridrickssons eye
socket

He screams so loud it jars loose icicles -
- hanging overhead in the rafters -

The icicles fall like daggers impaling the rousing pigs The
creatures MOAN in pain

Fridricksson grabs hold of the bird whose beak is stuck in
his eye socket And with a grotesque popping noise he yanks
it out

He swats the bird to the ground and stomps it to death

Blood gushes down his face He puts his palm over the empty
eye socket and runs down the aisle trying to wipe the blood
away from his good eye so that he can see where hes going

All around the SOUND of rousing Odd HONKS and PEEPS and
BARKS like a surreal chorus of Old McDonalds Farm

The sound is terrifying Creepy as hell

Half-blind Fridricksson runs his hand along the wall

He finds what hes looking for A handle He yanks it out
It doesnt move He yanks it up Nothing He yanks it down
and it gives way opening like a laundry shoot

He shoves himself inside

INT DANK COMPARTMENT ARK -—- DAY - CONT

Fridricksson slides down bumping against the walls
Expelled from the shoot hes shot sideways through a metal
grating crashing to the ground of this dank pen

He curses in Icelandic

The rooms quiet Almost too quiet And pitch black

Although Fridricksson cant see we hear him struggling to
flip his helmet light on Finally the CLICK

And the room fills with the sharp light We see that —
hes face to face with a SNOUT

He wipes the blood from his good eye and looks up into the
face of the nastiest beast imaginable

It licks its chops

And then in one deft move opens its gaping mouth and
consumes the better half of Fridrickssons upper torso
cleanly severing it from the rest of his body

That done the beast turns its attention to the hole in the
metal grating

INT FLIGHT DECK - DAY

Goodson sits atop Gregors shoulders ripping metal piping
from the ceiling With no welding equipment its quite a
chore Goodson succeeds in ripping off a sizable section
They cheer Gregor goes so far as to do a little celebratory
jig Goodson on his shoulders

Abby walks the perimeter of the flight deck knocking on the
walls SOLID SOLID HOLLOW She climbs down onto her
knees and peers through the metal grate

INT TEMPLE OFF FLIGHT DECK DAY - CONT

A crawl space Pocked with light filtering in through the
grate

Abby yanks the grate from the wall and squeezes herself
through the hole Flipping on her helmet light

The walls are plastered with tiny thin sheets of metal
Symbols are etched onto the copper like material

On the wall in front of her theres a design carved in the
wall A big round circle and then ten smaller ones of
varying sizes trailing out from it like tiny marbles

In the center of the room theres a tiny altar draped with
a fine but foreign fabric Abby crawls to it Its unlike
anything shes ever seen Theres something very personal
even mystical about it Little pieces of rock are laid out
in such a way as to mimic the design on the wall One big
rock ten little ones

Abby reaches for the large rock Then pauses Choosing for
some reason not to disturb the altar

Instead she selects one of the copper etches from the wall
and yanks it loose

JEFF (OS)
Abby

ABBY
Coming

JEFF (OS)
Where are you

ABBY
Dead-end

She shoves the tiny etch in her bra and backs out of the
room replacing the grate behind her

Jeff waits for her holding a similar grate

JEFF
Not sure how this will serve to
protect me But its better than
being empty handed right

He looks like hes trying to convince himself of this

ABBY

Abby puts her fingers through his grate holding it out in
front of her like a shield

ABBY
(continuing)
This could come in handy

She mimes fighting off animals

JEFF
Dont joke Abby You havent
been out there You havent seen
them You have no idea what were
up against

She hands the shield back to him
JEFF
(continuing)
Arent you going to take yours

He motions to the grate she replaced

ABBY
Ill take my chances

JEFF
Im not fucking around here Abby

ABBY
Neither am I Jeff

She raises her shirt Shes packing heat

impressed)
Since when do you carry a gun

INT BACK CORRIDOR ARK - DAY

Temple hurries down a corridor - dark long flanked with
frozen creatures

Temple activates the palm reader on the next portal door It
opens and with it a cacophony of noise and -

heinous gore

TEMPLES POV - THE NEXT CORRIDOR

The animals ravage each other Wolf attacks dog Lynx
attacks hyena Row after row after row stretching all the
way up to the rafters

The floors a sea of blood and guts and pelts

Temple stumbles backward assuming the worst That Emi and
Fridrickssons remains are there among the others

Its a disgusting spectacle of carnage

Near the portal door a bearlike creature with incredible
fangs crawls out of the shadows and charges Temple

He jumps back activating the palm reader

The door whooshes shut And the noise from the adjoining
corridor is abruptly silenced

Temple shudders Anxious he looks at all the frozen species
this rooms holds And runs back down the hall

To the last tarp covered table Dobbs unceremoniously yanks
off the tarp Gun raised

Eight bodies lie before us

SIMS
Theyre all dead

Dobbs holsters his gun and heads out

Welsh nods emphatically

DOBBS
What Whats peculiar about them

SIMS
According to our preliminary lab
results - they appear to be
overrun with a virus

What kind of virus

WELSH
A virus capable of genetically
mutating the host

Into what

They shrug

We cant tell But we think we
figured out how its transferred

He turns to leave Sims and Welsh head back to their
makeshift lab eyes on the freaky alien corpses Over their

INT CORRIDOR ARK - DAY

Gregor torch in hand leads the others down a hall towards
the rotunda

off-screen the sound of scuttling and slithering rustling
and flapping We can hear the animals but none approach

They navigate another passage without incident
Gregor turns to the others and smiles

GREGOR
Everything is scared of fire

A loud SNORT at the end of the hall They look
The most hideous beast imaginable the same one that did in

Fridricksson now stands before them its chest matted with
blood and intestines

It looks like the adult offspring of a Rhino and a Buffalo
Its breath bleats out like exhaust Like a locomotive

JEFF
Jesus

Gregor holds out his torch hoping to ward it off

The beast paws the ground and charges

Goodson whips out his gun and shoots the charging monster
But it doesnt even flinch much less slow Yellow ooze
drips out of its exit wound It barrels down on them

Goodson shoots again but his gun chokes

Jeff grabs Abbys hand and yanks her with him as he tries to
escape back down the hall

She resists struggling to free her own weapon

The charging beast is feet from Gregor and coming fast
Gregor has nothing but -

In one stealth move he rams the fiery torch down the beasts
throat

The creature struggles against the intrusion Throwing its
head back and forth it manages to swallow the torch down
Now turning its attention to Gregor it opens its mammoth
mouth Ready for the main course

A SHOT rings out

A single bullet pierces through the beasts head - in one ear
and literally out the other - taking with it the better part
of its pea brain Bits of beast splatter everywhere

Abby gun drawn watches the thing carefully gauging whether
or not it warrants another of her precious few bullets

Tt wont be necessary

The beast collapses on its hind legs Then topples over with
a resounding thud

Impressed Goodson looks at Abby Jeffs speechless
JEFF
(continuing)

You said you were a bad shot

ABBY
Yeah Well Im a good liar

Gregor fascinated with the yellow puss seeping out of the
animal leans over to investigate the corpse

ABBY
(continuing)
What is it

She takes off the outer shell of her coat and wraps it around
one of the metal pipes Dousing it with the lighting fluid
from her Zippo she lights it on fire Torch in hand she
kneels by the beasts body next to Gregor Pools of yellow
fluid form

ABBY
(continuing)
What the hell is that stuff

GREGOR
(shaking his head)
I dont know Ive never seen
anything like it

Perhaps its an optical illusion but it looks as if the pool
of yellow puss shies away from the light of Abbys torch

ABBY
(quiet)
Oh my God Is it alive

Jeff and Goodson hurry over and stare down at the pool Jeff
covers his mouth to protect himself from airborne germs

JEFF
Dont touch it

He pulls Abby away from the dead creature She bristles at
his protectiveness

Gregor pokes at the beast’s mouth with a pipe

GREGOR
Look at its molars
(they crowd in)
This guy started out as a friendly
herbivore

GOODSON
No way

JEFF
Thats impossible Cryogenics
cant turn a herbivore into a
bloodthirsty killing machine

GREGOR

He motions to the yellow pool - vibrating on its own volition

GREGOR
(continuing)
But maybe this stuff can

The pieces fall into places -

ABBY
Thats why the ship didnt thaw

They look confused

ABBY

(continuing)
Everything on this ship is
infected with that -

The main computer must have found
the virus And shut down This

diseased

A LOUD metallic RAMMING noise off-screen

Abby gun in one hand torch in the other leads the way
The guys follow

INT FRONT PORTAL ARK - DAY - CONT

Temple runs at the front portal door with what looks like a
metal shelf in his hands

He hits the door The SOUND of his COLLISION ricochets
through the rotunda eerily But it doesnt make a dent in
the door which sparks protectively electrically charged

Temple grabs the shelf and hurries back into the rotunda to
take another run at the door

JEFF

TEMPLE
Were locked in

ABBY
Where are Fridricksson and Emi

TEMPLE
Theyre dead The animals are
crazy Theyre killing each
other Its a blood bath back
there

Goodson and Gregor inspect the front portal door

TEMPLE
(continuing)
It was open when I first got here
and then it just closed

GOODSON
Thats not possible The doors
need to be activated to move

TEMPLE
Im telling you what happened

Goodson and Gregor find the inner palm reader They press
it but it wont open the front door They try to open it
with their pipes and other primitive weaponry but its
futile The doors electrical field sizzles every time they
touch it

ABBY
(assessing the
situation)
We have to freeze the animals back
up
JEFF

Abby all the floorboards are
circuited Even if we could find
out how to do that we run the
risk of it freezing ourselves
along with them

ABBY
I dont see an alternative Were
not going to get that door open
with good intentions If we can
freeze the animals we can control
the immediate threat

The SOUND of a GUNSHOT

Under Gregors supervision Goodsons unloading his weapon in
the portal door

Another SHOT

ABBY
(continuing)
Stop it Well need those
bullets
JEFF

Abby theres no assurance that
the animals would freeze quickly
The process may take days Even
weeks

ABBY
Do you want to know what the
alternative is Jeff The
alternative is waiting here
slowly dying of hypothermia while
we wait to see which deranged six-
thousand year-old creature gets to
eat us

Gregor and Goodson inspect the door The bullets didnt make
a dent

GREGOR
Eckmann will send men to get us

ABBY
And what if he doesnt

JEFF
(needing confirmation)
Theyre not going to let us die
down here Abby

GOODSON
They may suspect were already
dead

JEFF

Theyll come and check

High pitched and on the verge of hysteria Jeffs voice
echoes through the rotunda

ABBY
According to the hologram the
main computers on the sixth
floor If theres a way to turn
this ship off its there

Gregor and Goodson are silent dreading the trip ahead but
silently conceding that its their only real option

JEFF
Im staying here with Temple
Well try our luck with the
battery ram

Temples already given up on this idea

He laughs

ABBY
Jeff I know that that seems like
a good idea to you right now But
youre probably suffering from
hypothermia Your ability to
reason has been compromised -

hysterically insulted

JEFF
Fuck you Abby
(grabs the shelf from
Temple)
Fuck you and this stupid fucking
ship

He runs at the door again like a mad man

The force of the collision and the jolt of electricity throw
him to the ground Knocking some reason into him

Gregor leans over his prostrate form offering him his hand
Jeff reluctantly accepts it

INT BALCONY OVER ROTUNDA 6TH FLOOR — NIGHT

They arrive at a balcony that looks down over the rotunda
Rafters crisscross the ceiling

Theres only one portal door on this floor

They open it -

INT HALLWAY 6TH FLOOR - NIGHT - CONT

- the ceilings low in this corridor claustrophobic

Goodson shines his light to the end of the hall where
theres another portal door

The only thing between them and that door is a raised
platform on which there are eight coffin-shaped container
arranged like petals on a flower

They shine their lights at the odd centerpiece

The glass lids of the coffins are white opaque - frozen over
with a hard thick frost Gregor points his flashlight to the

nearest one

Delegating Abby the honor of opening it Gun in hand she
throws open the lid

Empty

He moves on to the next one She opens it

Nothing

ABBY
No aliens here

They open the third coffin just to be sure Empty
They all visibly relax

JEFF
Lets keep going

Something in the shadows - steps forward
All lights whip to that spot illuminating -

- a yeti Seven feet tall and completely white the
primates’ manlike roots are evident It steps forward

And its not alone

Other primates follow crawling out of the cubbyholes that
line the room

In a manner of seconds the primates surround the experts
trapping them by the coffins

TEMPLE
Fuck me

This could be the understatement of the millennium The
primates circle like a gang of street thugs

Abby stands by the third coffin Its lid still open She
motions for Temple to crawl inside

He nods his understanding And moves into position at the
foot of the coffin waiting for her cue

Abby inches to the next coffin and slowly opens the lid

She gets Gregors attention He nods Opening the lid of
the coffin nearest him - slowly as to not provoke the
primates

Abby moves to the next coffin but before she can open it
the primates move in Like some well-rehearsed tactical
offense they split up and go after our experts

Abby tries to open the lid but it sticks The latch frozen
shut She tries the next one

The yeti takes a swat at her Its fingernails come within
inches of her face She screams

Ttcicles fall from the ceiling momentarily distracting the
primates
She throws open the next lid and hurls herself —
INSIDE THE COFFIN

yanking the lid shut But it wont close The gnarled
fingers of the Yeti reach inside

With all the force she can muster she pulls the lid down
squeezing the fingers of the Yeti until it yelps retracting
its bruised hand

She forces the lid shut holding it down from the inside

Through the translucent coffin we watch as the primates
circle

A loud THUNK
A primate palm lands hard on the top of Abbys coffin

Inches from her face she watches as it claws at the deep
frost clearing away the ice -

- searching for the latch

She wrestles her gun out from underneath her and cocks it
preparing for the inevitable

Then just as suddenly as the attack began it ceases
The primates disappear from view

Not knowing if this is a ploy of the intelligent animal Abby
waits and waits She scans the coffin Up by her head
theres a pair of headphones perfectly fitted for a human
head She checks out the rest of the coffin It too appears
perfectly designed for a person

She tries the headphones on They block out ail sound She
takes them off Removes them from the coffin wall and slides
them into her bag

She takes a big breath bracing herself and throws open the
lid of her coffin Gun drawn

HALLWAY

The halls empty But the portal door at the end of the hall
is now open revealing an adjacent room and a throbbing red
light Abby checks the immediate area shining her light
deep into the cubbyholes

Clear

She gets out and taps on Temples coffin He tentatively
opens it

ABBY
Theyre gone

He sits up still cautious searching the room Abby taps on
all the coffins Gregor Goodson and Jeff climb out

GREGOR
Whered they go

ABBY
Dont know

GREGOR
(to Abby)
You alright

ABBY
(touched)
Yeah Thank you

JEFF
You think its a ploy

Goodson looks at him as if hes retarded

JEFF
(continuing)
Intelligent life forms have been
known to trick their prey you
know Theyre capable of deceit

GOODSON
You ever talk like a normal person
or are you always trying to prove
how smart you are doc

JEFF
(bristling with
contempt )
I didnt know prey” was a ten-
cent word Goodson -

A SOUND off-screen interrupts their petty argument

The SOUND of CRYING

A woman crying

- leads them to a narrow door of the old fashioned variety
that opens off the main corridor Abby opens it
INT OBLONG SHAPED ROOM ARK - NIGHT - CONT
Finding herself standing on the top level of a circular
staircase that rises up from the depths The rooms an odd
oblong shaped shaft
The SOUND of CRYING rising out of the darkness below
Abby shines her light down into the shaft

There a few landings down is Emi Her leg badly ripped
she crouches against the rail

EMI
Help me Please somebody help me

Temple hands his backpack to Abby and hurries down the
stairs Goodson follows

TEMPLE
Dont worry Emi Were here
Youre safe now

LOWER LANDING

They descend through the darkness round and round on the
metal steps

Temple arrives first

As he nears her huddled form he stares at her torn calf and
the gapping hole the missing tendon used to occupy

TEMPLE
Oh my God Emi Whatd those
fuckers do to you
He kneels at her side and raises her chin
Her eyes are cold Steely

She jerks forward

And before he has time to process whats happening she
throws a ligature around his neck

Using her good leg as leverage she tightens the ligature
made from her stethoscope cord against his neck and pulls
with all she has Temple struggles futilely

UPPER LANDING

Abby Gregor and Jeff look on horrified They charge down
the stairs

LOWER LANDING

But Goodsons already on it His weapon out he closes in on
Emi

GOODSON
Let him go

She looks at him as he nears and hisses A deep guttural
sound

Temple stops struggling as he loses consciousness She
tightens the ligature Theres no hesitation in her grip
No spark of mercy in her eyes

Goodson has no choice

He takes aim and -

- in one clean shot pierces clean through her heart

The force of the bullet knocks her off Temple throwing her
back against the rail She slumps to the floor

Abby Gregor and Jeff arrive on the landing
They run to Temple - try to remove the ligature

But the cords deeply embedded in the flesh of his neck -
having quickly and efficiently severed his windpipe He
stares up at them Dead

Goodson kneels next to Emi He puts his hand on her neck to
check her pulse Careful to avoid the yellow fluid thats
seeping from her chest wound

Then in the blink of an eye -

- in one dying act of will Emi jerks her head forward and
sinks her teeth into his arm

GOODSON
(continuing)
Oww

She clamps down He puts his gun to her temple and pulls the
trigger But hes out of bullets He slams the butt of the
gun against her head effectively shattering her frontal
lobe Now dead she sinks to the floor

Abby hurries to Goodsons side

ABBY

Are you alright

Goodson pries Emis teeth from his arm Yellow puss covers
his wound

GOODSON
No maam I dont think I am

INT BALCONY OVER ROTUNDA 6TH FLOOR - NIGHT

The four remaining members of the expedition crew stand on
the top floor of the ark overlooking the rotunda They
shiver fighting off the cold thats slowly killing them

Goodsons watches his stop watch pass the four hour mark

GOODSON
Its the prudent thing to do

ABBY
(vehemently)
I wont allow it

GOODSON
T understand your sentiments
Abby I do and I appreciate it
Really But it’s the only option

ABBY
No

Abby sets about moving Temples belongings - CDs hair pick
mouthwash from his backpack into hers Anything to keep
herself busy

GREGOR
Abbys right There may be a
cure A simple cure to eradicate
the virus

GOODSON
The nearest hospitals a two-hour
flight from here Theres no
guarantee that well even make it
out of here by then

ABBY
Well take our chances

Goodson turns to Jeff who has been conspicuously silent

GOODSON
Dr Garipoli agrees with me

Jeff doesnt answer His silence a confirmation This
enrages Abby

ABBY
Well Dr Garipolis a prick we
can disregard his opinion

GREGOR
The virus may have taken hours to
infect Emi We have no idea how
long it takes to infect the host
or even if youre infected at alli
Goodson Perhaps you have a
natural immunity -

JEFF
Or it may only take minutes

GOODSON
Listen Im a Green Beret When
it sets in none of you will have
a chance in hell of getting off
this ship alive

Abby shakes her head She doesnt want to hear anymore

GOODSON
(continuing)
Abby you either give me the gun
and let me do the right thing or
you seal your own fate

Hes persuading Gregor

GOODSON
(continuing)
Three good people have already
died down here If you dont let
me do this well all die

ABBY
No

GOODSON
Give me your gun Abby Please

ABBY
Im going to kill Eckmann As
soon as I get out of here I
swear to God

Goodson takes the gun from her Jeff activates the portal
door and ducks into the adjacent hallway

Gregor steps forward and hugs Goodson heartily He searches
for something to say -

GREGOR
(feebly)
God bless
Gregor leaves Abby alone with Goodson

ABBY
Please Dont do this -

GOODSON
As the commanding officer I order
you to step off this balcony and
close the door behind you
She breaks down He kisses her gently on the cheek
GOODSON
(continuing)
Go shut this ship down
INT HALLWAY 6TH FLOOR - NIGHT - CONT

She walks through the portal door frustrated with her own
helplessness

Goodson salutes her He presses the palm reader and the door
whips shut

And then the SOUND of a single gunshot
Jeff tries to comfort Abby

ABBY
Dont touch me

Gregor offers her a hanky

She leads the way down the hall and toward the flashing red
light of the next corridor wiping tears from her eyes

ABBY
(continuing)
Lets shut this motherfucker down

INT MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT - CONT

A large throbbing orb the source of the blinking red light
sits in the middle of the this long hall Flashing on and
off sporadically

Artifacts line both walls One wall is lined with flat
pieces of metal stacked side by side all the way to the
ceiling

JEFF
What the hell are those

Abby grabs one from the shelf Upon inspection it looks
like a thin hand held mirror but then symbols appear all over
it Similar to the etchings she found earlier

ABBY
Theyre books

Jeff grabs it from her

ABBY
(continuing)
In Arabic That ones on
trigonometry

On the other side of the hall Gregor stares in wonder at the
shelves of artifacts - familiar but odd

GREGOR
These are their personal
belongings I think Look

He points to a round picture frame Inside theres a solemn
portrait of a family dressed in one-piece coats fur hats
atop their heads

As Gregor and Abby watch the photos set in motion Abby
gasps

Snow falls The women in bright scarves primp straightening
their hair and the mens long beards One of these men looks
familiar - weve seen his corpse laid out on the table in the
hangar A child runs through the foreground of the picture
with some sort of shiny object that flies a foot over its
head The family pet a sheepostrich chases after the
child who laughs The family settles down posing for the -

The picture stops a freeze frame of the group photo
Jeff joins Abby and Gregor They look over the shelves of

photos cooking utensils - theres even something that looks
like a childs tricycle

A NOISE behind them

Abby whips around expecting to see people But instead its
the missing primates

They emerge from behind the red orb where they have been
lying in wait

JEFF
Fuck

GREGOR
Listen if the books are in
Arabic theres a good chance the
computer is in Arabic as well
Jeff and I will lure them out of
here so you can get to the
computer Abby

JEFF
Tll shut the computer off

GREGOR
You read Arabic shithead Now
listen Ill only have time to say
this once

The primates move in

GREGOR
(continuing)
We have to make sure we get them
all out of here

JEFF
What do we do with them

Gregor grabs a shovel from the artifacts shelves He tosses
Jeff a hoe

GREGOR
We improvise As soon as Abby
throws the power Ill pry open
the front portal door

JEFF
You didnt have much luck last
time

GREGOR

Last time it was electrified

Abby can you do it Shut the
ship off Ill seal the door

there -

He motions to the portal door at the end of the hall

Ld GREGOR

(continuing)
- youll be alone able to
concentrate

ABBY
I can do it

GREGOR
As soon as you initiate the
eryogenic process we wont have
long But Im confident I can get
the front portal open get out
get help So even if you feel
yourself -

He doesnt want to say it

GREGOR
continuing)
know that I’m coming back for
you

Abby nods her understanding

® sere

Me too Abby I wont leave you
in here

touches her arm)
Remember to touch the floorboards
as little as possible on your way
down

ABBY
Go

Gregor rushes forward drawing the attention of the gaggle of
primates

GREGOR
Hello ape-shit You want some
Croatian whoop-ass you furry
cocksuckers

The primates look at the relatively unarmed man They may be
bloodthirsty killing machines but they havent lost their
senses They charge

He bolts The primates pursue Abby jumps up onto a shelf
removing herself from the impending stampede

One orangutan leaps up to Abbys shelf and screams in her
face trying to frighten her out of hiding She grabs a lamp-
like object and fends the creature off

Jeff grabs a hoe and wallops the thing on the head It falls
to the ground dead

Pissed the yeti charges him He runs for the next hall

JEFF
Abby -

But whatever he was going to say is cut off as the portal
door whips shut Abbys alone She climbs down from the
shelf and hurries past the flashing orb which shoots off
electric pulses

INT HALLWAY 6TH FLOOR NIGHT - CONT

Jeff and Gregor sprint down the hail primates in pursuit

Jeff opens the portal door at the far end of the hall out
onto -

INT BALCONY OVER ROTUNDA - NIGHT - CONT

Goodsons body lies in a heap A gaping hole where his
head was Jeff recoils

More practical Gregor shoves the body off the ledge to make
room It falls down into the darkness of the rotunda

INT MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

Behind the orb Abby finds a large checkered floor much like
a ballroom At the far end theres a wall of knobs and
levers She rushes towards it

Bad move

As soon as she makes contact with the checkered floor it
shoots out sparks

She jumps back onto the orbs platform
And takes a better look at the floor

Eight distinct squares across And eight squares long The
square second from the right blinks on and off

Assessing the situation she jumps off the platform and lands
on the blinking square Without incident No sparks

In response the bank of controls on the far wall lowers down
closer to the ground
INT HALLWAY 6TH FLOOR - NIGHT

The primates stand at the closed portal door at the end of
the corridor angrily beating on the metal barrier

Suddenly the door whips oapen -
INT BALCONY OVER ROTUNDA 6TH FLOOR - NIGHT - CONT

- revealing Jeff who stands dangerously close to the railing
Hes the bait

As the yeti clamors forward the door whips shut blocking
the other primates off -

And isolating the yeti

Tt goes for Jeff

Sweeping in from the side with neither the grace of an
acrobat or the dexterity of a gymnast Gregor hanging from
ene of the rafters - swings in and kicks the yeti with all
the force he can muster

He knocks it over the railing

The yeti plummets down into the darkness of the rotunda

A resolute THUMP as it makes contact with the floor

Gregor and Jeff peer over the ledge and exchange a tentative
smile

Jeff moves back into his position As bait

They run through this routine again An apelike creature
this time

JEFF
Over here Bumbles

Again Gregor swings in and kicks this creature down into the
depths of the rotunda Joining its mate with a THUMP

JEFF
(continuing to
Gregor)

You the man

GREGOR
No youre the man

Confident that they have this down to a science Gregor opens
the portal door

But this time the primates rush in together having figured
out the game

Improvising Gregor grabs the shovel He hits a particularly
menacing gorilla on the head But it doesnt even slow

Instead it turns on him grabs Gregors head with both hands
and slams him into the wall with enough force to knock him
out

Staggering Gregor grabs hold of a rafter and pulls himself
up into the rafters The gorilla follows

Jeff scrambles to grab the hoe as the two remaining primates
near He swipes at them but they deftly avoid his swing

They come at him full court press

Backed against the railing he has no place to go He closes
his eyes preparing for the worst —-

when Gregor swings down and kicks at the nearest ape It
flies into its mate with enough force that they both stumble
over the railing and fall down into the rotunda

Jeff looks up

The gorilla pursuing Gregor through the rafters closes in
Infinitely more coordinated than Gregor it swings out
prepared to swat him off his beam

Jeff grabs the hoe And in some move inspired by Mickey
Mantle

he swings hard and cleanly knocks the creatures’ head off

He smiles like a little leaguer whose just hit his first home
run

GREGOR
(continuing)
Jeff

Behind Jeff a primate the final one hits him over the head
with its two fists clenched together Jeff falls to the
ground and hits his head on the hoe knocking himself
unconscious

Gregor shovel in hand adrenaline pumping runs at primate
and jousts it over the ledge

INT MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

From a distance the sixty-four square floorboard looks like
a lit chessboard

In the rooks position Abby moves in an inverted L
formation With each successful move the control panel
lowers closer to the ground

Quickly she makes her way across the floor

The control panel is an overwhelming spectrum of knobs and
levers No words or symbols

Going to give it the old college try anyway she reaches
forward and it sparks at her Its electrified too

She kicks at it And again

ABBY
Shit

The console responds -
- lighting up in a magenta hue
Abby stares in wonder
ABBY
(continuing in
Arabic)
Hello
The console beeps in response
Abby breaks into the biggest shit-ass grin youve ever seen
ABBY
(continuing in
Arabic
How do I shut this fucker off
INT ROTUNDA ARK - NIGHT
Gregor drags an unconscious Jeff down the stairs onto the
main floor of the ark Past the pile of ape carcasses
through the rotunda —
INT FRONT PORTAL ARK DAY - CONT

- and down the front passageway

Suddenly the floorboards beneath dull - the red shifts to a
pinkish rose hue ever fading

GREGOR
(yelling elated)
Abby youre brilliant

He props Jeff against the wall and sets to work Prying the
front portal door no longer electrified open

He has a hoe and a shovel Thank God hes an Eagle Scout
INT MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

The lights flicker off as Abby cranks a final knob The
floorboards immediately respond Rapidly shifting back

through the spectrum of colors

She turns to leave There out over the chessboard a
hologram appears

Of a solar system

Of the many celestial bodies One lights - stark white A
frozen moon One of four it orbits a large planet which in
turn orbits the sun

Bewildered Abby stares at the model Suddenly it occurs to
her what this is She walks out onto the floor and looks at
the third planet from the sun

This little planet has its own moon She looks closer Tiny
continents can be made out on the planet

Its Earth She looks at the lit ice moon again and counts
the celestial bodies out from the sun

ABBY
Youre right

The console BEEPS shrilly as it shuts down not understanding
her transgression into English

She looks at the floorboard beneath her feet It fades from
magenta to light blue The ships shutting down Freezing
back up

She needs to move

She sprints past the wall of artifacts

Something on the shelf catches her eye

INTEXT ARK -— NIGHT

Using the hoe as a lever Gregor opens the door wide enough
to drag Jeff out He wedges the shovel in the door to keep
it open

Exhausted Gregor slides down the outer wall keeping an eye
on the internal passageway guarding the narrow opening

GREGOR
Come on Abby Move it

INT BACK CORRIDORS ARK - NIGHT

This hall once the scene of a bloodbath is now cast ina
hypnotic blue hue as the floorboards fade to blue

The remaining animals slow as they continue to fight one
another Their speed and accuracy compromised

A coyote lunges at its prey but by the time its body responds
to its mental command the prey the armadillo creature is
gone The coyote snaps the air ineffectively

The armadillo takes a final wobbling step forward then
freezes Its front leg stuck to the ground It struggles
vainly as its tail also in contact with the ground becomes
immobile

The coyote lurches forward This time it successfully makes
contact But as it gets the armadillos neck within its
jaws it succumbs to the cryogenic process freezing in mid-
bite

INT HALLWAY 6TH FLOOR - NIGHT

A short figure can be made out coming down the hallway
accompanied by an odd MECHANICAL NOISE It nears Closer
and closer

Abby Pedalling a tricycle like childs toy over the
floorboards down the hall to the balcony -

INT BALCONY OVER ROTUNDA 6TH FLOOR - NIGHT - CONT

The rafters glow a deep dark blue

Everywhere birds struggle to take flight The smaller ones
are already frozen to the beams The larger ones cock their
heads and futilely try to flap a wing here and there unable
to fight the process

The floor beneath Abbys wheels is bright blue As are all
the stairs curving round and round back down into the rotunda

THUMP THUMP

Rising up the stairs out of the shadows comes a hurling
mess of prehistoric terror

A horn in the center of its head this creature makes the
beast that killed Fridricksson look like a lap dog

Abby backs her bike up as she watches the inevitable - rise
from the depths

INT EXT ARK - NIGHT

Gregor waits by the front door maintaining his vigil He
checks on Jeff who doesnt look good

GREGOR
Hold on Im going to get you out
of here

A NOISE within the passageway draws Gregors attention back
to the ark

GREGOR
(continuing)
Abby

A handful of animals come forward down the plankway A goat
sluggishly picks up each hoof and places it in front of the
next Trying to make it to the door

Gregor picks up the hoe and prods the goat and the other
pathetic animals back

GREGOR
(continuing)
Come on Abby
INT BALCONY OVER ROTUNDA 6TH FLOOR - NIGHT
The creature has arrived It looks like a rhino A very
angry rhino It steps onto the balcony its footstep falling
like thunder
Abby turns her little bike around and pedals away But
theres nowhere to go but back down the hall to the main
control room
The rhino advances She retreats across the balcony
Backed into the railing Theres nowhere to go but -

up -

into the rafters She abandons the bike and climbs onto
the railing hoisting herself onto the nearest beam glowing
blue

The rhino follows Stepping up onto the railing it pokes up
at Abby with its horn

Abby pries a squawking half-frozen crow from the rafter and
hucks it at the rhino Angered the rhino rams the beam
And again and again Relentlessly Abby holds on

Finally the beam jarred loose from its bearings gives way
and slides from the wall Like hockey pucks frozen birds
slide down the beam toward Abby

She hurls them one after another at the rhino and jumps to
the next rafter

She makes it

But looses her footing She manages to grab the beam

She holds on as the rhino rams the support beams Her hands
in direct contact with the cryogenic beam are slowly losing
their grip as they freeze

A large bird of the freaky prehistoric variety pays her a
visit Looking down from the beam at her distressed face it
squawks at her shrilly Pecking her hand with its beak it
tries to break skin

She lifts a hand off the beam and tries to swat it off but
she misses She grabs for the beam but her numb ineffectual
hand will not comply

She hangs on with other hand -—

- until she cant any longer

She looses her grip

And falls down into the darkness that lies below

EXT ARK — NIGHT

Gregors freezing He puts his head by Jeffs mouth feeling
for his breath Still alive but barely

Suddenly the shovel gives way and the portal door whips shut
open only a slit where the shovel handle sticks out

Its time to move Gregor throws Jeff over one shoulder and
heads off through the ice cavern to the elevator

GREGOR
Hoid on

From the intonation in his voice its not clear if he means
this for Jeff for himself or for Abby left back in the ark

INT ROTUNDA ARK - NIGHT

The rooms the color of midnight blue So dark you could
almost mistake it for black

In front of us a mass slowly takes shape as our eyes adjust
to the dark

A pile a heaping pile of primate corpses on the floor of the
rotunda

Something moves A figure rises from the top of the heap
A helmet light clicks on

Abby

INT FRONT PORTAL ARK - DAY —- CONT

The SOUND of her running down the passageway to this door

ABBY
Im here

She tries to pry the door open but her hands are numb Tries
to wedge it open with the shovel but it wont budge She
bangs against the door futilely

Beneath her the floorboards continue to darken

She scoots up onto the flat part of the shovel projecting out
from the door and sits there to avoid contact with the floor
She screams into the tiny opening in the door

ABBY
(continuing)
Im here

Theres no response The wind whistles down through the ice
cavern

ABBY
(continuing)
Please help me

Her speech is slowing Shes fading

A NOISE Theres something in the passageway Coming down
toward her

What is it Its so dark Shes losing consciousness She
cant make it out Is it a person

No its the huge motherfucker with the horn
And its not done with her yet

It charges

Abby lets it gain speed

And at the last minute she throws herself to the side and
lets it ram the portal door

Piercing it with its horn it rips the door clean out of the
wall

The rhino staggers around the door crushed up into its head
Then falls over onto the ice cavern floor dead

Abby drags herself through the opening and crawls out In
the distance she can make out the lights of the elevator

ABBY
(continuing)
Help -
The car ascends up and out Its light fades
Abby stretches her arm out futilely She falls face first to

snuffed out

Gregor struggles Four of Dobbs men surround him They
forcibly take the rifle from his hands and drag him from the

Gregor struggles against Dobbs men as he watches the elevator
car lower without him

Following his lead his men begin shooting indiscriminately

aim The dog growls yellow puss dripping from its mouth

Eckmann leads Abby to the back table and pulls the tarp aside
revealing the alien bodies

ECKMANN
There are eight all together
Dobbs would never have removed
them if he knew they were
eryogenic

ABBY
Whyd he take them at all

Eckmann doesnt have an easy answer for this

ECKMANN
T pay Mr Dobbs to look after my
best interest Abby Sometimes I
overlook details Mr Dobbs - he
doesnt Im thankful he took the
initiative

Abby spots the dozen tarp covered tables across the room
She hurries over there flipping the tarps off the table upon
table of test tube fetuses in various stages of gestation

ABBY
What are these

ECKMANN
Embryos of every creature on that
ship The entire genetic content
of Noahs Ark all in this little

Theyre all diseased you know
Thats why the ship never thawed
quickly she turns to
Eckmann)
Youre going to destroy everything

ECKMANN
Of course

know the extent of the
contamination The whole ship
must be detonated

Eckmann sadly looks at the ground Late as always Gregor
arrives at the waiting chopper bag thrown over his shoulder

GREGOR
I hope theyre not stingy with the

He throws his bag in the chopper and turns to Jeff They
shake

Gregor wont take his hand

GREGOR
and for your lifeblood I will

hard feelings

Dobbs pulls the trigger and shots Eckmann point blank Blood
soaks through his chartreuse suit he fails to the ground
Dead The line of men and dynamite temporarily ceases

DOBBS
(continuing)
Prepare for the excavation

OFFICERS
Yes sir

These men know who they work for

OFFICER 1
(to line of men)
Take it back in

And just like that the dynamite crates head back to the
hangar handed from grunt to grunt back down the line Dobbs
kicks Eckmanns corpse for good measure and motions for it to
be thrown in the ice shaft The two officers see to it
Pronto

CUT TO
GLACIER TOP - SUNSET

The camp is a flurry of activity as Dobbs orders are quickly
put into motion Two rows of tents are swept aside revealing
a deep trench dug into the glacier - wide enough to raise the
ark The cranes which have been idly waiting on their
sides are hoisted upright and moved into position

INT CHINOOK - SUNSET

Abby and Gregor recline in their respective chairs watching
the turquoise bay pass below the chopper

ABBY
You shouldve quoted the next
psalm too Whoever sheds the
blood of man by man shail his
blood be shed”

GREGOR
Sometimes what isnt said carries
more weight no

Is he flirting with her Out her window Abby spots a
humongous barge make its way up the seaward channel and into
the bay Why would they need a barge that size She looks
perplexed For a half a second

ABBY
That son of a bitch lied

Gregor looks out her window spots the barge - follows Abbys
train of thought

GREGOR
Eckmanns many things Abby But
hes an honest man He said hed
destroy it he will

The familiar SOUND of static accompanies a radio message
coming over the pilots radio

RADIO MESSAGE (OS)
Cats away

PILOT
Copy

He sneaks a glance in the rear-view mirror as he prepares to
lower the Chinook on the tarmac on the edge of the bay

ABBY
(whispering)
I dont think Eckmanns calling
the shots anymore

GREGOR
What do you mean

ABBY
Dobbs These are his men

GREGOR
Are you talking about a - coup

ABBY
I dont know He removed the
genetic material on his own
Eckmann told me

GREGOR
What would Dobbs want with the
genetic material

ABBY
I dont know But Ive got a bad
feeling about this

In one deft move Gregor dashes forward and knocks the pilot
unconscious with his shoe He pushes the man aside and
crawls behind the controls Abbys speechiess

GREGOR
I never second-guess a womans
intuition

She smiles shocked

ABBY
You know how to land this thing

GREGOR
(smiling)
Abby come on Im an Eagle Scout

EXT TARMAC SUNSET

The chopper comes to a rocky landing on tarmac Behind the
wheel of an ECKMANN ENTERPRISES truck one of Dobbs men
waits to take Abby and Gregor to Reykjavik

EXT TARMAC INT TRUCK - SUNSET
Suddenly Abby and Gregor appear on either side of the car

Gregors dressed in the downed pilots outfit points a gun
at the bewildered man

GREGOR
Listen I dont want to kill you
What Id like to do is tie you up
and put you in the chopper with
the other man What do you say

The guy scrambles for his gun
GREGOR
(continuing)
I didnt think youd go for that
option
He shoots him Abby stares in disbelief
GREGOR
(continuing)
You ever kill someone Abby

ABBY
I live in San Diego

cuUT TO

INT TRUCK DUSK

Abby now dressed in military fatigues sits behind the
wheel Gregor sits shotgun still in the pilots uniform
Theyre parked on the halfway mark of the bridge that spans
the channel and marks the barrier between the inland bay and
seaward channel

They watch as the barge passes underneath heading to the
glacier Abby revs the engine

GREGOR
Now or never

She guns it and -
EXT BAY - DUSK — CONT

- the truck flies off the side of the bridge through the air
and onto the deck of the barge

As it hits the deck Abby and Gregor jump for it

They roll across the deck Gregor grabs Abby and quickly
ducks behind the monstrous tarps rolled up on board

The truck continues its trajectory passing over the deck of
the barge and into the icy blue water of the bay

Men run out of the control room to see what the commotions
about but by the time they get on the deck theres nothing to
see - no evidence that anything out of the ordinary happened

The truck disappears with so little as a few unremarkable
bubbles

An iceberg scrapes by the barge accompanied by the loud
shrill noise of ice grinding Convinced this was the source
of the commotion the men head into the control room

And Gregor and Abby burrow into the middle of the rolled up
tarp to seek shelter from the wind and cold as the barge
continues its voyage through the bay of icebergs back to the
glacier

EXT GLACIER TOP NIGHT

Floodlights are set up throughout camp casting enough light
to illuminate Denmark

The cranes are up and running flanking either side of the
deep trench A space has been cleared between the trench and
the precipice Steel braces mark the intermittent stop for
the ark
1il

The cranes GRIND heroically

And then slowly the ark appears raising out of the trench
One story after another raises out of the glacial depths

Looking all the more fearsome in the artificial light the
ark is enormous Dobbs cup of coffee in one hand gun in
the other supervises the excavation

EXT BASE OF GLACIER - NIGHT

At the foot of glacier the barge docks Crewmen prepare for
the precious cargo They unroll the tarps Empty

EXT CAMP GLACIER TOP - NIGHT

Yawning Jeff steps out of his tent And stops in place
marveling in disbelief

It looks like the ark is hovering over the camp
EXT GLACIER TOP NIGHT

Abby and Gregor in military attire climb the steep glacial
embankment and onto the surface of the glacier

GREGOR
Holy fuck

Suspended from cranes the ark lowers onto the makeshift
brace

ABBY
Weve got to find Jeff

She runs to the campsite Gregor trails behind
EXT CAMP GLACIER TOP - NIGHT

Dobbs stands at the base of one of the cranes bull horn in
hand

DOBBS
More More Keep coming

With a final terrific SCRAPING the ark settles into the steel
brace

DOBBS
(continuing)
Secure this mother now

The men scramble to obey his orders
EXT CAMP GLACIER TOP - DAY

As they approach Jeffs tent Gregor grabs Abby and pulls
onto a small rise between two tents

GREGOR

Abby wait
ABBY

Weve got to find him Hes in

danger
GREGOR

I dont think so Abby I think
hes in on this with Dobbs ff
think this is his idea

She scoots away from him recoiling from his statements

GREGOR
(continuing)
Think about it They boarded the
ark saw what they had on their
hands and decided to squeeze
Eckmann out

ABBY
I dont believe you

GREGOR
Abby that ark is a geneticists
wet dream

Abby spots Jeff on the rise behind Gregor He motions for
her to be quiet She doesnt know what to do

GREGOR

(continuing)
Im sure he thinks he can salvage
the material but its impossible
All the samples are infected Its
only a matter of time before some
military gets there hands on the
material and turns their men into
killing machines Or their
enemies

ABBY
What do you mean

GREGOR
If you put a virus like that in

the water supply of your enemy

GREGOR (contd
Youd only have to wait a few
weeks and then invade Everyone
would be dead Theyd have all
killed each other You could hold
an entire country hostage with
just the threat of a virus like
that

Gregor reaches out for Abby Jeffs right behind him now
He searches for something in his pocket Abbys confused
Gregor reads this on her face

GREGOR
(continuing)
Abby I know its unpleasant to
entertain the possibility but
Jeffs one of the bad guys now
He probably always was

ABBY
(making up her mind)
Gregor look out

But he doesnt have time to respond Jeff finds his gun and
shoots Gregor Abby jumps Not believing what shes just
witnessed Jeff rolls Gregors body down the embankment and
wipes his hands off in the snow trying to get the blood off

JEFF
Ugh Its sticky

Jeff looks at Abbys bewildered expression and laughs

JEFF
(continuing)
Abby Abby Abby - your mother
always said you were a bad judge
of character

Taking her off guard he lunges at her and quickly pins her
to the ground He produces a hypodermic needle and jabs it
deep into the flesh of her thigh She looks up at him as
she fades out

EXT CAMP - BEFORE DAWN

Now firmly in place on the makeshift brace the arks being
welded shut for transport

We watch as the industrial cranes are moved closer to the
edge preparing for the final descent of the ark down to the
waiting barge The crews are working round the clock

Dobbs stands at the base of the brace looking up at the ark
He approaches six men on their smoke break They quickly
jump to attention

DOBBS
(pointing to the
hangar)
Get in there and pack the bodies
for transport and all the tissue
samples Now

The men scurry
INT HANGAR - BEFORE DAWN

Foggy vision Abby comes to Slowly Shes tied toa

GRUNT
Yes sir

Jeff brings Abby a cup of water

JEFF
Morning sunshine

She takes a mouthful and spits it in his face

JEFF
(continuing)
Abby dont be mad at me You
must have some idea what the
genetic material on the arks
worth dont be naive

ABBY
What happened toa you

JEFF

The virus alone is -

ABBY
You left Gregor to die He saved
your life

JEFF
Bringing up your new boyfriend at
a time like this Shame on you
Abby

ABBY
You were down there You saw what
this virus is capable of -

JEFP
Save me the morality lecture for
Christs sake Abby

ABBY
You kill Allister Eckmann and you
dont think anyones going to
notice

JEFF
(playacting)
Tt was an accident A terrible
terrible accident Im sure hed
want us to continue our research

ABBY
(not amused by his
theatrics)
You going to kill me too Jeff
Or are you going to make one of
the grunts do it Or Dobbs

JEFF
(deathly serious)
If you make me

ABBY
You cant buy me off Im not
going to be responsible for
unleashing hell

JEFF
Then youre going to die

He pulls out his gun
ABBY

Dobbs going to kill you too
Jeff You know that right

JEFE
(laughs)
He needs me Abby Im the brains
behind this operation if you
havent noticed I see the
potential

He cocks his gun but hesitates

JEFF
(continuing)
Dont look at me

She looks at him

ABBY
You going to kill me tied up like
this Like an animal

He considers this

JEFF
Theres a hundred armed men just
waiting to put a cap in your ass
so dont try to pull a Rambo You
dont have it in you to be a hero
old girl

He unties her As soon as the binds drop from her wrists
she throws her weight forward and head butts him He
staggers back She quickly grabs his gun But she cant
shoot him

ABBY
Take off your clothes

CUT TO
A FEW MINUTES LATER

Shes got him tied in her former chair Naked His own
pants as a gag

ABBY
Somehow the sight of you naked
always could get a laugh out of me
She blows him a kiss and hurries off through the hangar -
INT HANGAR - NIGHT - CONT

- she arrives at the boxes of dynamite Quickly fills her
backpack with sticks A passing grunt spots her

She makes a run for it Bolting to the open doors at the end
of the hangar
EXT HANGAR - NEAR DAWN - CONT
She runs out

Dobbs men surround her A pack at her front One at her
back

They move in weapons drawn

Reaching over her shoulder she grabs sticks of dynamite from
her pack lights them and hucks them at the men

The dynamite detonates And snow flies everywhere obscuring
their view of her They cant get a clean shot off

Lined up facing one another they inadvertently begin to gun
one another down as they aim for Abby - who crawls under the
gunfire and the flurry of snow

She bolts for the communications trailer

INT HANGAR - DAWN

Two grunts balance an alien body between them As they make
their way through the hangar they spot Jeff tied to the
chair struggling vainly

INT HALLWAY COMMUNICATIONS TRAILER - DAWN

Abby comes through the door Turns to bolt it behind her
There are no locks

She runs into the main control room

Abby quickly rewires the sound system

The DEAFENING SOUND of a GUNSHOT Theyre taking down the
door

She fastens the last connection - hooking the stereo system
to the PA system

Another GUNSHOT This one blows a hole through the door
She grabs her bag and shakes out the contents Dynamite
sticks embryonic fluid sample and -- Temples CD She puts
one in the stereo system and cranks all the knobs

Returning to her bag she searches -

Another GUNSHOT Another door hinge blows out

She finds what shes looking for The alien headphones She
puts them on Grabs the mike

The sound is so loud -

among them

What the hell

Dobbs opens his mouth to explain when -

The opening chords of STEVIE WONDERS “SUPERSTITIOUS BLARE
The SOUND shakes the building

EXT COMMUNICATIONS TRAILER DAWN - CONT

And the next and the next The whole camp shakes to the bass
beat

Dobbs men cover the ears kneeling in pain

The trench dug into the glacier avalanches in on itself
pulling in the surrounding area

Like quicksand tents and men and speakers go down with it

The shoddy foundation beneath the trailer gives way -- the
trailer slides off its supports And the men in the hall
topple into one another

The steel braces beneath the ark slip on the icy surface of
the glacier

And the ark slides forward slipping off its makeshift brace
and onto the surface of the glacier

A crane goes down taking a portion of the hangar with it

Dobbs and his men run outside They shoot at the speakers
They get one down

INT CONTROL ROOM COMMUNICATIONS TRAILER - DAY - CONT
Complete silence

Were in the stifling stillness of Abbys headphones No
noise except the sound of her own accelerated breathing She
looks around terrified

Not able to hear anything going on outside the room she
watches as another gunshot tears a hole in the door

An air vent Overhead She climbs up on the machinery but
before she can hoist herself up into the vent the trailer
slides

And shes thrown to the floor Machinery crashing all around
her

EXT CAMP - DAY - CONT

Slowly the ark slides toward the precipice

Dobbs screams orders to his men But no one can hear him
The music is so loud

To demonstrate his wishes he grabs a grunt by the shoulders
and places the man in the path of the ark The grunt looks
petrified

The mammoth ark bears down sliding toward him He wants to
run but Dobbs watches The grunt closes his eyes preparing
for the worst Futilely hes crushed to death as the ship
continues to slide getting closer and closer to the
precipice over the bay

SUPERSTITIOUS suddeniy stops And with it the ark

climbs and the CD plays again

As the trailer lurches down the slope Jeffs thrown against

the control room door -- it gives way and he rolls into the

EXT COMMUNICATIONS TRAILER - DAY - CONT

Climbing out through the air vent Abby now stands on top of
the trailer

She looks over the edge

The bay of icebergs looms hundreds of feet below The
trailer precariously balances on the precipice Fuck

She turns to run A hand on her ankle Jeff Crawling out
of the air vent behind her

Abby kicks at him To no avail Hes not letting go He
yanks her toward him

The trailer slides out further over the edge

Abby bites Jeffs forearm Hard He lets go She jumps to
her feet as the trailer slips beginning its plunge

She runs over Jeffs body and using his back as a
springboard leaps back to the glacier

The trailer plummets down It lands on the deck of the barge
and busts into a hundred pieces

As soon as it hits SUPERSTITIOUS abruptly stops in mid
note

Struggling up the glacier in search of solid footing Abby
tosses the alien headphones aside

A tremendous GRINDING NOISE a heavy metallic teetering She
turns The ark is balanced precariously on the edge of the
glacier

The bow hangs out over the bay But not enough to tip it

She watches as Dobbs and his men run to the cranes to secure
the ship Dobbs himself climbs up into one of the cranes

Abby hurries to a land cruiser

Dobbs hearing the engine turns in time to see Abby battery
ram the neighboring crane It totters

She reverses and hits it again This time it goes over

Silently like a majestic redwood the crane falls Landing

in the cockpit of his downed crane screaming as he passes -

She shots him square in the forehead

The crane goes over the edge And is gone in the blink of an
eye

GREGOR (0S)
Abby

She whips around prepared to shoot
Very much alive a badly wounded Gregor limps toward her

ABBY
I thought you were dead

She Looks him over A tourniquets wrapped around his
shoulder

GREGOR
Its only a flesh wound I1l be
fine

They look at one another and then he leans in She leans
in and they kiss A nice modest first kiss

CUT TO

EXT GLACIER TOP - SUNSET
The camp is ablaze

All over ignited boxes of dynamite burn The hangar
choppers and trailers reduce to smoldering pieces of debris
that crumble to ash The wind scatters the ash in every
direction

Icelandic Emergency Workers run around the burning camp
administering aid to the wounded men Abby and Gregor stand
on the precipice of the glacier staring down into the depths
of the bay as the sun sets over the North Atlantic

Behind them the surface of the glaciers ablaze with smoke
and fire as all evidence of the ark is engulfed in flames

EXT ABBYS HOUSE SAN DIEGO CALIFORNIA NIGHT

The SOUND of old school STEVIE WONDER filters out from the
garage

The camera pans over Abbys sleepy yard and the comforting
SOUND of CICADA to - the front porch where Abby sits in her
porch swing Her three cats lie all around her She pets
them absentmindedly

Gregor comes out from the house a bottle of beer in each
hand

GREGOR
This was all there was in the
fridge

ABBY
Thanks

She scoots over making room for him on the swing He sits
They rock sipping their beers

GREGOR

How did the story get passed down
ABBY

Hmm
GREGOR

If the ship never thawed and ail
the original people -

ABBY
(with a smile)
aliens

GREGOR
Aliens never got off then how do
we have the story of the ark
passed down through the
generations In almost every
culture It doesnt make sense

Abby leans forward

ABBY
Theres something I want to show
you

She selects one of her cats and hands her to Gregor holding
the tag so that he can read it

GREGOR
Tigger

ABBY
Other side

Theres a symbol on this side which looks familiar

Abby reaches into her bra and takes out the copper etch she
removed from the temple in the ark

She hands it to Gregor The etch matches the symbol on the
kittys tag The cat purrs rubbing against him

ABBY
(continuing)
That symbols Arabic
GREGOR
(holding up the etch)
Is this from the ark

She nods

ABBY
It means second of three

As Gregor processes this information Abby clinks her beer
bottle against his And looks up at the brilliant night sky
full of stars and possibilities

Camera pulls out over yard and up to the sky

FADE OUT

THE END
