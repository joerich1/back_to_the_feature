KINGDOM COME

written by
Alex McAulay and Chris Sivertson
EXT BEACH - FLORIDA - NIGHT

Were looking up at a breathtaking view of the night sky The
Milky Way cuts a bold swath through the darkness like an
ethereal stroke from an impressionist’s brush

TWO ATTRACTIVE TEENAGERS lay head to head in the sand next to
a bonfire Gazing at the stars RYAN COOPER and EMILY
ANDERSON (both 17) make a perfect couple A high school beach
party goes on around them but Ryan and Emily are in their
own world Ryan’s battered acoustic guitar lays in the sand
nearby along with an empty bottle of wine

It’s a mellow party About TWENTY KIDS Some of them lounging
by the fire drinking beer a couple guys tossing a Frisbee
others hanging out by the moonlit water Soft INDIE-ROCK
MUSIC plays on a boombox

Ryan admires Emily’s profile Emily feels his gaze gives him
a warm content grin This is young love at its best
unspoiled by age and cynicism or fear and self-doubt Ryan
and Emily kiss Then Emily pulls back and looks intently at
Ryan for a long moment

RYAN
You okay

Suddenly mischievous she springs up and jogs down to the
water Ryan moves after her Barefoot they let the incoming
water swirl around their feet Emily stares out at the Gulf
of Mexico something important on her mind

RYAN (CONTD)
We going swimming

EMILY
I got a better idea

Emily puts her arms around Ryan’s neck

EMILY (CONTD)
My dad’s not going to be home for a
couple hours
She lets that hang for a moment Ryan grins

RYAN
Okay

EMILY
I know you want to fuck me

OFF Ryan’s stunned reaction we CUT TO
INT EXT EMILY’S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

Emily drives her white mustang convertible down a secluded
road near the water Ryan rides shotgun The wind whips
through their hair Sand gusts across the road

Ryan scans through Emily’s iPod which is hooked into the
cars stereo system He chooses a track and a BEAUTIFUL SONG
starts playing It fits the mood perfectly

Emily glances at him Takes his hand Ryan leans back unable
to believe his luck

EXT EMILY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Emily drives up to a waterfront Spanish-style mansion

INT EMILY’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

The BEAUTIFUL SONG continues on the soundtrack as Emily and
Ryan enter through the foyer She leads him upstairs

INT EMILY’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Emily and Ryan enter She shuts the door behind them This is
a teenage girl’s dream room Glass doors open onto a balcony
that overlooks the Gulf Thin white curtains billow in the
breeze

Ryan glances at an odd stack of oil paintings leaning against
the wall The canvas on top portrays a young man tearing his

head open to reveal another head underneath It’s a haunting

depiction of pain and madness

Emily hugs Ryan from behind

EMILY
Simon painted that Before he got
sent away I’m keeping his
paintings safe so Dad doesn’t throw
them out

Emily nuzzles Ryan’s shoulder as he looks at a photo on the
wall It shows Emily and her younger brother SIMON ANDERSON
with their BEAUTIFUL MOTHER The three of them look very
happy together

RYAN
How’s Simon doing
EMILY
(frowns )
No more talking

She moves Ryan to the bed sits him down

Emily slowly pulls her top off revealing a white bikini
Ryan watches as she undoes her shorts and pushes them to the
floor She could not possibly look any better standing there
in the bikini curtains flowing behind her She helps Ryan
out of his shirt Then shoves him back onto the bed and
climbs on top of him

They kiss Softly at first but it quickly grows heated Ryan
runs his hands down Emily’s tan back to her hips Emily
stops the kiss for a moment Looks at Ryan

EMILY (CONTD)
I’m doing this because I love you
Ryan

And we can tell from Ryan’s eyes that he loves her too but
he doesn’t have time to respond because Emily’s already
kissing him again Their hands are all over each other and
things are progressing faster and faster And Ryan’s hands
are unhooking her top and -

JIM Emily

Emily and Ryan look over to see Emily’s father JIM ANDERSON
poke his head in the room The teenagers freeze as their
perfect dream night comes to a screeching halt

Jim is stunned Emily leaps off the bed covers her breasts
Jim advances on them his shock giving way to pure rage

JIM (CONTD)
Goddamnit Emily

EMILY
(starting to cry)
Dad

RYAN
Look sir I’m sorry -

JIM
Get the hell out of here

RYAN
This is my fault

JIM
(screaming)
Get out I said
EMILY
But Dad -

JIM
Shut up Put on some goddamn
clothes

EMILY

(crying harder now)
I’m sorry Daddy

Jim slaps Emily hard across the cheek It’s sudden and it’s
shocking Ryan is instantly on his feet Almost as a reflex
he shoves Jim sending the man sprawling to the floor

RYAN
Dont touch her

Emily sobs clutches her cheek in pain Ryan moves over to
her Furious Jim scrambles to his feet pushes Ryan away

JIM
Don’t tell me what to do in my
house with my daughter

Jim grabs Emily by the shoulder and starts shaking her
violently

JIM (CONTD)
I’m more ashamed of you than I am
of your brother Now get dressed
you slut -

Ryan suddenly snaps charges forward and punches Jim in the
face Jim staggers back and Ryan punches him again Jim hits
the floor blood spewing from his nose Emily’s SCREAMING but
Ryan is caught up in his own fury He descends on Jim
punching him again and again

EMILY
Nooo

Ryan finally regains control of himself Jim cowers on the
floor Gasping for air Spitting blood

Shaken Ryan realizes that he has gone way too far but it’s
too late now Emily SCREAMS and CRIES and there’s so much
blood and everything has spiralled out of control so quickly
and as things reach a fever pitch we CUT TO

EXT MOUNTAINS - COLORADO - DAY

In a HELICOPTER SHOT we zoom over snowy mountains The
landscape is impossibly vast
A wilderness of both beauty and desolation Far down on a
narrow road a passenger van travels up into the mountains

INT EXT PASSENGER VAN - MOVING - DAY

Ryan sits at the back of the van Cold and miserable In the
seat in front of him is a skinny tweaker named BEN Several rows of empty seats separate them from the driver - a
bloated bear of a man named OWEN JONES (40s)

The road is a twisty one with gusts of snow occasionally
blowing across the pavement Not an easy drive but Owen
handles the van with confidence

Ryan stares out the window There are no signs of
civilization Only snow-covered trees and craggy mountain
peaks Far removed from Florida’s paradise climate

BEN
Man we are so screwed

Ryan is not in the mood for conversation He lets Ben’s words
wash over him

BEN (CONTD)
I’ve heard this place flat-out
sucks Freezing cold No chicks No
drugs God I wanna get high

Ryan just watches the passing landscape

BEN (CONTD)
Where you from

RYAN
Florida

BEN
No shit You believe this cold I
mean people live like this I’m
from Fresno and I can’t handle snow
and shit no way I don’t know how
I’m gonna make it here

Ben is rambling like his brain is fried from too many drugs
BEN (CONTD)
Don’t tell anyone I said this but
I’m already homesick

Ryan doesn’t respond He just looks out the window
INT EXT EMILY’S ROOM - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

Emily is curled up on her bed her eyes red from crying She
gazes listlessly out the open balcony doors at the Gulf

RYAN (0S)
Emily

Startled Emily sits up She quickly gets out of bed and
races through the doors and onto the balcony Ryan is
standing on the manicured lawn below staring up at her

EMILY
Ryan Oh my god

RYAN
I tried to call you -

EMILY
I’m coming down Don’t let my dad
see you

RYAN
No stay there You’1ll just get in
trouble

EMILY
But -

RYAN
I love you Emily I just needed to
tell you that before I leave I
snuck out and ran all the way
here

Emily starts to cry

EMILY
I love you too Ryan I’1l wait
for you

JIM (0S)
(furious)
You will do no such thing

Emily spins around to find her father standing behind her
his face still battered and bruised Emily stumbles away from
him as he leans over the balcony to yell at Ryan

JIM (CONTD)
I just called the cops You’re in
violation of the court order I’11
get you sent to jail instead of
reform school you hear me
With a last look at Emily Ryan takes off running heading
for the safety of the trees before the police arrive

Emily turns to face her dad

EMILY
You think you can just send all
your problems away where you don’t
have to deal with them First
Simon now Ryan You’re a coward

JIM
Get back inside

Emily angrily brushes past him into her room leaving her dad
alone on the balcony

INT EXT PASSENGER VAN - MOVING - BACK TO PRESENT

Ryan glances down at a small photo of Emily in his hand He’s
holding it low behind the seat where Ben can’t see it Ben
just keeps talking intent on filling any silence

BEN
Second time I got popped for
crystal the judge says he’s gonna
send me to Briarcliff He told me
I needed the fear of God to go
straight I mean there’s supposed
to be a separation of church and
state It doesn’t -

Ryan and Ben are suddenly thrown against the side of the van
as the vehicle hits a patch of ice while rounding a curve
The van careens spinning out of control on the mountain
road Ben SCREAMS and Ryan holds on for dear life Owen seems
unfazed calmly trying to regain control of the vehicle

The van comes to a jagged halt right at the edge of a cliff
sending snow and ice cascading over the precipice

Owen looks back at the boys with a disconcerting grin

OWEN
Fun stuff huh

Ben holds onto the seat afraid to move Ryan catches his
breath Stares forward They’re safe for the moment but the
van is still stuck in the road and there’s a blind turn
directly in front of them

OWEN (CONTD)
My name’s Owen by the way Owen
Jones

(MORE )
OWEN (CONTD)
I used to go by “OJ” but I ditched
that handle in the nineties Now
everybody calls me Big Juicy -

RYAN
Um sir

Owen gives him a petulant look

RYAN (CONTD)
I mean Big Juicy Shouldn’t we get
moving If someone comes around
that corner we’1ll get hit

Owen glances at the road Shrugs

OWEN
We don’t get much traffic this time
of year You two are the last
arrivals Ten to one we could sit
here a couple hours and be okay
I’m happy to put my fate in the
Lord’s hands Aren’t you

Ryan and Ben stare at Owen for a long moment all too aware
of that looming curve right in front of them

Then Owen cracks up laughing A deep throaty bellow

OWEN (CONTD)
Just messing with you

Owen backs the van up fully onto the road Starts driving up
the mountain again Ryan breathes a sigh of relief

OWEN (CONTD)
Look I know exactly what you boys
are going through right now

BEN
(muttering)
Doubt it
OWEN

I’m serious When I was your age I
was a mean little sonuvagun My
butt got hauled up this mountain to
Briarcliff too It was the best
thing that ever happened to me

An SUV rapidly approaches coming down the mountain

OWEN (CONTD)
Well what d’ya know

Owen waves at the DRIVER as the car passes
OWEN (CONTD)
Guess the good Lord was smiling on
us today boys

Ryan slumps back in his seat as Ben cackles nervously

EXT BRIARCLIFF REFORM SCHOOL - DAY

The van pulls off the main road and onto a massive circular
snow-covered driveway

Beyond the driveway looming up from the snow and the trees
is a huge terrifying-looking building This is Briarcliff
Five stories tall with wings and turrets and sweeping walls
of crumbling brick like an abandoned medieval monastery It
sits in utter isolation and decayed grandeur Large windows
reflect back the snow and the ice like unseeing eyes

INT PASSENGER VAN - MOVING - CONTINUOUS
The van slows Ryan and Ben peer out at the school

BEN
Jesus

OWEN
I’1l ignore your blaspheming for
now But you better watch your
mouth ‘round here

Owen brings the van to a stop in front of a massive stone
walkway that leads to Briarcliff’s front doors

OWEN (CONTD)
Home sweet home

He puts the van in park and pushes open his door

EXT BRIARCLIFF REFORM SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

Ryan and Ben get out of the van their feet sinking into the
calf-deep snowdrifts Grey sky hangs heavily above them
Thick with ominous clouds

Ryan and Ben are both shivering

OWEN
(amused)
It never gets above twenty in the
winter Me I don’t feel the cold
anymore

BEN
(muttering)
It’s ‘cause you got so much fucking
blubber

Owen tilts his head

OWEN
Briarcliff’s gonna do great things
for you Ben Maybe even teach you
to respect other people’s feelings

BEN
What about my feelings man This
place sucks donkey balls You’re
hurting my feelings

Ryan ignores the two of them Gazes up at the building It
seems nearly abandoned He scans the windows of the imposing
structure for signs of life

A flash of movement in one of the top windows catches his
eye Like someone has been standing there watching and just
now turned away The movement startles Ryan

OWEN
Something spook ya

RYAN
No sir
(tiredly)
I mean Big Juicy

OWEN
When I was a kid here we used to
say the school was haunted
Course now I know the only ghost
‘round here is the Holy Ghost So
come this way why don’t you

Owen starts rapidly waddling through the snow to a long
walkway lined with creepy stone statues Some are religious
icons others are of seemingly lost children Ryan and Ben
follow as Ben rants inaudible gibberish under his breath

RYAN
Uh Big Juicy

Owen doesn’t even turn around Just keeps waddling

OWEN
Yeeees

RYAN
You know a kid here named Simon
Simon Anderson

Owen stops in his tracks as Ryan catches up with him Owen
turns around There’s a strange almost hostile look in his
eyes

OWEN
What do you know about Simon
Anderson

RYAN
(taken aback)
Nothing Just some guy from back
home Don’t worry about it

Owen continues staring at him for a tense moment but then
turns around and starts walking again Ben flips out at Ryan
as they trail after Owen

BEN
Dude you already know someone at
Briarcliff You got a friend from
back home here That sucks Why am
I always the one who’s on his own
Fuck

INT FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

Ryan and Ben step into the massive foyer Owen shuts the door
behind them Electric candelabras hang on the walls and down
from the ceiling casting flickering shadows across the
cracked marble floor

Owen hangs back against the wall as a tall thin priest
named FATHER CLEARY (60s) walks forward through a large
open common room toward Ryan and Ben He’s accompanied by TWO
THUGGISH-LOOKING MEN who each walk a step behind him

BEN
(under his breath)
This is some freaky shit right
here man

Father Cleary gets closer and more of his features are
revealed His face is thin and scarred marked with hundreds
of tiny pockmarks

The thuggish men both with the thick necks and ramrod
posture of drill instructors step up next to Father Cleary
glaring at Ryan and Ben Ryan swallows hard Ben sways back
and forth

Father Cleary eyes the two teenagers imperiously He makes
the sign of the cross with a black-gloved hand

FATHER CLEARY
(gentle lisp)
Welcome to Briarcliff my children

INT STOCKROOM B - MOMENTS LATER

Ryan is violently thrown up against a white wall an arm
pressed against his neck Choking and gasping for air

One of the two thuggish men BROTHER GRIMES (late 20s) has
pinned Ryan to the wall He and Ryan are alone

The stockroom is small and narrow with harsh fluorescent
lights on the ceiling and a cement floor Against one wall
are stacks of uniforms on plywood shelves Three large
laundry carts are parked against another wall

RYAN
(gasping)
Please -

Ryan is about to pass out His eyes are closing the lids
flickering

EXT BEACH - FLORIDA - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

For a second Ryan is on the beach with Emily Her face hovers
above him

EMILY
I love you Ryan

INT STOCKROOM B - BACK TO THE PRESENT

Ryan opens his eyes again Brother Grimes leans in and
presses his face against Ryan’s

BROTHER GRIMES
For the next five months your ass
belongs to me

He shoves Ryan down and moves into the center of the room
Surprisingly graceful like a boxer dancing in the ring Ryan
sinks against the wall struggling to catch his breath

BROTHER GRIMES (CONTD)
What the priests don’t see the
priests don’t know Got it

RYAN
(whispers )
Got it

BROTHER GRIMES
In your file it says you’re a
tough guy You like to beat people
up You don’t seem so tough to me

Ryan is slowly recovering Rubs his throat and coughs

BROTHER GRIMES (CONTD)
Get up Mr Cooper We’re gonna get
those duds off you and give you a
brand new uniform

Ryan clambers to his feet Looks extremely pissed off but
manages to hold his rage in check Brother Grimes rummages in
a laundry bin He grabs a pair of dress slacks underwear a
button-down shirt and a tie He flings them at Ryan’s feet

BROTHER GRIMES (CONTD)
Strip and put these on Everything
off even your skivvies I gotta
check for contraband

RYAN
Strip right here

BROTHER GRIMES
You ain’t got nothing I haven’t
seen before Unless you’re a tranny
wearing ladies underwear Are you a
tranny Mr Cooper

RYAN
No sir

BROTHER GRIMES
Well that’s one good thing about
you then
He finds a pair of shoes and socks and throws them at Ryan

BROTHER GRIMES (CONT’D)
What are you waiting for

Ryan takes off his shirt

BROTHER GRIMES (CONTD)
Anything in your pockets

Ryan hesitates Grimes cracks his knuckles

BROTHER GRIMES (CONTD)
The truth will hurt less than a
lie

Ryan pulls out the photo of Emily Reluctantly hands it over
Grimes studies it with a smirk

BROTHER GRIMES (CONTD)
Well ain’t that romantic

(holds it up to the light)
Take your last look kid Cause by
the time you get outta here she
won’t even remember your name

INT LONG CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Dressed in his new uniform Ryan is escorted down an
incredibly long corridor by Brother Grimes

A mean-looking kid comes out from around a corner He wears
the same uniform as Ryan His name is JAY YOUNG He
glares hard at Ryan Menacing eyes under thick brows

BROTHER GRIMES
Late for supper are we Mr Young

JAY
Just a little sir

BROTHER GRIMES
Then get your ass in gear

Jay picks up his pace Then suddenly he lurches forward
pretending to trip But instead he nails Ryan in the balls

with a rabbit punch

Stunned Ryan doubles over in pain gasping for air Jay
hurries away down the corridor towards the cafeteria

BROTHER GRIMES (CONTD)
(amused)
Keep moving

Ryan manages to start walking down the hallway again His
face is red from pain embarrassment and anger

BROTHER GRIMES (CONTD)
So you hungry

RYAN
(trying to recover)
Yes sir

BROTHER GRIMES
Well too bad Supper is 1800
hours No exceptions

Ryan realizes that Grimes is screwing with him but keeps
silent

BROTHER GRIMES (CONT’D)
You wont be eating anything
tonight but air my friend

EXT COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER

Brother Grimes leads Ryan outside into the freezing cold
night This large courtyard is in the middle of the vast
school A rickety wooden chapel sits in the center of the
courtyard Over a hundred years old It has a lopsided
ramshackle appearance Candlelight flickers from within

Ryan huddles against the cold looking glum as Grimes leads
him to the chapel Their breath is visible in the night air
Ryan looks up at the sky The number of stars is staggering

Grimes opens the ornate chapel door pushes Ryan inside

INT CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS

Grimes leads Ryan down the center aisle An enormous wooden
sculpture of Christ on the cross dominates the far wall
Everything is intricately crafted old and intimidating
Candles burn everywhere The only modern touch is a glass
baptismal tank

Grimes opens the door to a confessional booth set into one
wall Dark inside Ryan looks at Grimes

BROTHER GRIMES
Time to confess your sins

Ryan steps hesitantly into the booth and Grimes slams the
door behind him

INT CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

It’s pitch black For a moment all we hear is Ryan’s nervous
BREATHING Then a small shutter is pushed open in the wall

letting in errant candlelight From behind a mesh screen we

glimpse Father Cleary’s gaunt profile

Ryan sits down Unsure what to do For an uncomfortably long
moment there is silence Finally Ryan can bear it no more

RYAN
Hello

Father Cleary coughs and then clears his throat
FATHER CLEARY

How long has it been since your
last confession child

RYAN
I um I’ve never been to
confession I’m not Catholic

FATHER CLEARY
Then we have a long night ahead of
us you and I Tell me why you
have been sent to Briarcliff

Ryan hesitates He’s tired Hungry Homesick Cold

FATHER CLEARY (CONT’D)
(prompting)

You have nothing to fear This
house of worship is one hundred and
sixty years old The school itself
was built around the chapel much
later Generations have found
absolution within these walls

Ryan sighs Gazes into the flickering candle through the mesh
screen

RYAN

Okay well I’ve been in love with
Emily Anderson since the sixth
grade It wasn’t until last summer
that I finally got the nerve to ask
her out She said yes I couldn’t
believe it I took her miniature
golfing on our first date

(smiles )
She accidently whacked me in the
shin on one hole We still laugh
about that -

INT BRIARCLIFF REFORM SCHOOL - LATER

Brother Grimes walks Ryan down another long corridor in the
maze-like building Ryan holds a few items a towel a
nightgown a toothbrush He looks exhausted

BROTHER GRIMES
Since you apparently had so many
sins to confess you’re late for
lights out

Grimes stops in front of a large pair of doors Carved into
the dark wood above them SUFFER THE LITTLE CHILDREN UNTO ME

BROTHER GRIMES (CONTD)
Your friend Ben will be spending
the night in solitary Seems like
he needs an attitude adjustment

Grimes turns and flings open the doors revealing a huge
dimly lit space filled with bunk beds Many are occupied by
sleeping TEENAGE BOYS

INT THE DORMITORY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ryan peers around the room Huge windows opposite the door
let in stark moonlight and reveal a stunning view of the icy
Colorado wilderness It looks like a polar landscape - just
ice snow and mountains as far as the eye can see

We also see that up high in the corners of the room are
surveillance cameras hidden behind Plexiglas shields

Brother Grimes strides inside the room clutching Ryan by the
shoulder

BROTHER GRIMES
(screaming)
HELEN Got a new one for you

Several BOYS in nearby bunks wake up peer at Grimes and Ryan
sleepily

HELEN comes running But Helen is not a girl He’s a
short nerdy boy with a pink plastic hearing aid in one ear
Wearing a white nightgown

He reaches Ryan and Brother Grimes We hear A FEW KIDS call
out RUDE NAMES and JEERS at Helen Brother Grimes silences
them with a stare

HELEN
Here Brother Grimes sir

BROTHER GRIMES
You’re gonna show this kid his
bunk His name’s Ryan Cooper and
he’s from Florida

Some kids start JEERING again hidden in shadows One voice
emerges from the crowd

RANDOM VOICE
Florida sucks dick

BROTHER GRIMES
Quiet Or I’1ll make you do push-ups
‘til you bleed

The threat is met with immediate silence Grimes glances
contemptuously at Helen

BROTHER GRIMES (CONTD)
Take it from here Helen

He turns on his heel and leaves the room closing the door
behind him Helen looks inquisitively at Ryan for a moment

HELEN
(gentle asthmatic voice)
Ill take you to your bunk okay

RYAN
Sure

Ryan walks with Helen down a labyrinthine row of bunks He
feels the stares of other boys coming from the shadows and
hears HISSES and threatening MURMURS

They finally reach an empty bottom bunk and Helen stops They
whisper to each other

HELEN
This one’s yours Ryan Mine’s the
one across

RYAN
Thanks Hey why do they call you
Helen

Helen looks depressed Points to his hearing aid

HELEN
It’s pink and I have a mild
hearing disability Helen Keller
I guess

RYAN

What’s your real name
Helen shakes his head ruefully sits down opposite him
HELEN
You don’t want to know Most people
can’t pronounce it right anyway

RYAN
Try me

HELEN
No really It’s okay I can live
with Helen

Ryan has a seat on the metal bunk bed Helen points to a
dented trunk at the base of the bed

HELEN (CONTD)
Put your stuff in there

Ryan picks up his nightgown peers at it with distaste

HELEN (CONTD)
They love to humiliate us

Ryan pulls off his shirt too tired to complain He starts
taking off his shoes

RYAN
Listen do you know a kid named
Simon Anderson Black hair kind of
thin Fifteen but he looks
twelve He’s my girlfriend’s kid
brother

Helen tilts his head and gives Ryan a strange look like he’s
reevaluating him

HELEN
Simon’s the weirdest kid at
Briarcliff

EXT BRIARCLIFF REFORM SCHOOL - LATER
The school is bathed in moonlight From somewhere in the

distance comes a strange HOWLINGWHISTLING sound A chilling
otherworldly noise

EXT GOLF N’ STUFF - FLORIDA - DREAM SEQUENCE - NIGHT

Ryan and Emily are at a miniature golf course with a cheesy
tropical theme They’re at a hole that ramps up steeply to a
faux waterfall It’s their first date

Ryan is standing right behind Emily his hands over hers
showing her how to grip the putter

EMILY
Like this

RYAN
Yeah You got it Now just hit it
hard enough to get the ball up the
hill

He takes his hands off hers Emily grins at him tucks a
strand of hair behind her ear

EMILY
Here goes nothing

Emily pulls the putter back and whacks the ball - accidently
bashing Ryan’s shin on the follow-through

Ryan yelps going down to one knee and clutching his shin

EMILY (CONTD)

(gasps)
Oh my god are you okay

RYAN
(smiling through the pain)
Yeah I’m fine

EMILY
I’m so sorry oh god
(she bursts out laughing)
I don’t mean to laugh it’s just -

She’s staring up the ramp at the waterfall There’s no sign
of the ball

EMILY (CONTD)
I think I got a hole in one

Ryan starts laughing too as he begins clambering to his
feet

RYAN
Nice

Ryan looks up right as -

Emily smashes the putter brutally down onto his head Blood
gushes down his face as Emily rears back for another blow He
SCREAMS and tries to scrabble away from her but she’s too
fast

Emilys eyes have gone completely black She opens her mouth
but what comes out is not her voice but a terrible
HOWLINGWHISTLING sound She brings the putter down with
superhuman strength as we SMASH CUT TO

INT THE DORMITORY ROOM - NIGHT

Ryan jerks violently awake in bed He gets his bearings
breathing heavily coming down off the disturbing dream That
CREEPY WHISTLING sound continues outside

Ryan looks over at Helen’s bunk The kid is sound asleep
Ryan looks around the room freaked out

He’s surprised to see a BOY in a white nightgown standing
over at the massive picture window The boy’s back is to
Ryan like he’s gazing out at the icy wilderness

Ryan sits up Puts his bare feet down The floor is ice cold
Ryan stands walks over to the boy

RYAN
(whisper)
Simon

The kid doesn’t turn around He just keeps staring out the
window Ryan moves to his side looks at SIMON ANDERSON He’s a small boy Pale with sickly dark hollows beneath his
eyes He ignores Ryan his vacant gaze fixed on some upper
part of the large mountain visible behind the school

RYAN (CONTD)
Simon it’s me Ryan Emily’s
boyfriend
(no response)
You okay

Simon doesn’t even turn his head Transfixed by something
outside

RYAN (CONTD)
Simon

Still no response Freezing and frustrated Ryan gives up and
walks back over to his bunk Helen’s awake looking at him
He puts on his hearing aid

HELEN
(whispers )
Simon’s a sleepwalker

Ryan sits on his bed finally understanding

HELEN (CONTD)
Happens every night

Ryan’s eyes linger on Simon There’s something disturbing
about the image of this small boy framed by the vast
wilderness

HELEN (CONTD)
Hey whyd he even get sent here
No one knows

RYAN
After his mom died he kept saying
her ghost was talking to him He

got in a big fight with his dad
about it Then he tried to kill
himself

HELEN
They sent him here for that

RYAN
That’s the kind of guy his dad is

Ryan gets under the covers The WHISTLING noise howls away

RYAN (CONTD)
What the hell is that sound

HELEN
There’s a crevice up in the
mountains somewhere Hundreds of
feet deep is what the priests say
Maybe thousands When the wind
blows over the top it makes the
noise Like when you blow over the
rim of a bottle

Ryan listens

HELEN (CONTD)
They say it’s the sound of dead
souls trapped in the mountain
Total hogwash

RYAN
How can you stand it

Helen smiles at Ryan and then takes out his hearing aid
stashing it under his pillow Then he reaches beneath his
mattress and pulls out a mini iPod

HELEN
My secret weapon
(his smile fades)
You won’t tell anybody will you

Ryan smiles shakes his head Helen grins relieved He lays
his head on his pillow

Ryan watches Simon at the window for another moment Then
closes his eyes

INT CHAPEL - MORNING

The chapel is packed to capacity as the BOYS stand in the
pews singing a HYMN There are about FIFTY of them in all
ranging in age from 13-17 Everybody in uniform

Ryan stands next to Helen shivering and mouthing the words
from his hymn book as he looks around He sees Simon toward
the front The kid mumbles his way along with the group

Father Cleary stands at the pulpit leading the song There
are about TEN PRIESTS sitting near the front singing along
Owen stands behind them crooning away like Pavarotti

Grimes and several other big “BROTHERS” move slowly down the
aisles making sure every boy is singing

Jay pretends to sing as they pass him His beefy lackeys IKE
and SAMMY (both 17) stand on either side of him looking
tired and sullen

Off to the side THREE NUNS stand together singing as well
Two of them are older and rotund The third is young and
rather beautiful though she seems intent on covering up that
fact with her habit This is SISTER FIONA (mid-20’s)

INT CAFETERIA - MORNING
Ryan and Helen shuffle through the food line The three nuns

are behind the counter dishing out breakfast As they pass
the first nun Helen whispers to Ryan

HELEN
That’s Sister Mister
RYAN
Huh
HELEN

‘Cause she looks like a man

Ryan can’t help but laugh to himself The next nun serves
them more food

HELEN (CONTD)
(whisper
And that’s Sister Fist-Her cause
they say that’s what she does at
night to Sister Mister

Ryan tries to contain his laughter He’s able to as they
reach Sister Fiona - he’s struck by her simple beauty Ryan
smiles at her as she dishes him out more food Sister Fiona
smiles back

Ryan breaks off from the line Helen tagging along behind
him Ryan scans the cafeteria He spots Simon sitting alone
way off in the corner He heads toward him

Jay sits at a table with Ike and Sammy Jay smirks at Ryan
and Helen as they move past

JAY
(under his breath)
Get a room homos

Ike and Sammy crack up like it’s the wittiest joke ever Ryan
ignores all of them and keeps walking

HELEN
That’s Jay I suggest you stay away
from him

(MORE )

HELEN (CONTD)
They say he got sent here because
he burned down his school With
the principal still inside

But Ryan is more interested in Simon He reaches Simon’s
table and puts down his tray

RYAN
Hey Simon Long time no see

Simon looks up at him for a long moment Like he’s confused

RYAN (CONTD)
It’s Ryan from home Remember

SIMON
(dazed)
Oh yeah hey

RYAN
Okay if we sit down

Simon nods Ryan and Helen have a seat start to eat

RYAN (CONTD)
So your dad got me sent here too
I got in a good punch first though
(takes a bite of food)
How you holding up

SIMON
Okay

Simon is extremely withdrawn Ryan tries to coax him out of
his shell

RYAN
Emily misses the hell out of you
But she’s doing good She wants me
to tell you how much she loves
you And she’s saved all your
paintings

Simon just stares at Ryan for a long uncomfortable moment

SIMON
You shouldn’t have come here

The way Simon says it makes Ryan uneasy He laughs it off

RYAN
I didn’t have a choice -

Simon abruptly stands up clutching his tray Ryan watches
perplexed as Simon walks away

EXT ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY

A burly Irish priest FATHER O’BRIEN stands on the rugby
pitch surrounded by boys Half of them wear black rugby
outfits the other half (including Ryan and Helen) wear
white Father O’Brien is a fiery redhead with a smattering of
scarlet gin blossoms across his mug

FATHER O’BRIEN
You boys ready to become men If
only for the afternoon

BOYS
(in unison)
Yes Father

Even though the sun is shining it’s extremely cold The
ground looks frozen

FATHER O’BRIEN
You know the drill Hold nothing
back And if I catch any of you
yanks half-arseing it I’1l feed ya
to Sister Mister’s cunt

The boys LAUGH O’Brien tosses the rugby ball to Jay - who
wears a black uniform (as do his lackeys Ike and Sammy)

Helen looks depressed He’s not wearing his hearing aid
O’Brien eyes Ryan
FATHER O’BRIEN (CONTD)
You’re the new cock on the block

RYAN
Yes Father Ryan Cooper I -

He hesitates for a second

FATHER O’BRIEN
Spit it out lad

RYAN
I don’t know how to play rugby

FATHER O’BRIEN
Well I don’t know how to play
pansy but I’m talkin’ to you
aren’t I

Jay cackles and the other boys all start laughing at Ryan

FATHER O’BRIEN (CONT’D)
Man up Cooper Man up It’s no
different than a street fight
except there’s a ball involved

Jay tosses the ball hard at Ryan’s chest and we CUT TO

Sister Fiona sits behind a massive oak desk framed by a
large window Simon sits in front of the desk his gaze fixed
on the mountain outside the window

SISTER FIONA

He doesn’t respond Sister Fiona turns and looks outside

SISTER FIONA (CONTD)
The mountain It’s beautiful isn’t

He finally looks at her

SISTER FIONA (CONTD)

SIMON

SISTER FIONA

SIMON

SISTER FIONA
It may seem that way at first but
the medicine will help you Along
with talking and prayers

Simon’s gaze drifts back to the window Fiona regards him for
a moment Clearly she wants to help this troubled boy

SISTER FIONA (CONTD)
What about your dreams Are they

Simon doesn’t take his eyes off the mountain as he replies

SIMON
They are not dreams

EXT ATHLETIC FIELD - SIMULTANEOUS

A kid on the black team kicks the rugby ball and the game
begins The black team rushes forward several of them
actually SCREAMING as the ball is caught by a boy on the
white team The kid starts running down the field

Ryan runs along nearby trying to figure out what’s going on
Just as members of the black team come careening at the kid
with the ball he tosses it to Ryan

Owen sits in the bleachers wolfing down a huge sandwich
Several priests sit with him watching as Ryan dodges
opponents while boys HOLLER and SHOUT around him

BAM Jay and Ike and Sammy smash into Ryan simultaneously
at full speed driving him down into the cold hard ground

The ball tumbles out of Ryan’s hands and Jay scoops it up
then punts it down field

Ryan gasps for air the wind knocked out him He sees Jays
face loom over him

JAY

SIMON (CONTD)
(louder)
Bradley Tachuk
The name clearly has some terrible meaning to Sister Fiona

SIMON (CONTD)
He’s the reason you’re here

SISTER FIONA
How -

She takes a deep breath trying to regain her composure

SISTER FIONA (CONTD)
What do you mean

SIMON
The reason you became a nun
EXT ATHLETIC FIELD - SIMULTANEOUS

The ball rolls to Helen who does his best to avoid it
Helen catches Father O’Brien’s insane gaze

HELENS POV (AURAL and VISUAL) Father O’Brien SCREAMS at him
but the sound is LOW and DISTORTED as Helen would hear it

Helen picks up the ball halfheartedly runs with it

THE SOUND RUSHES BACK IN as Helen is brutally tackled by
several boys He makes no attempt to hold onto the ball

Ryan is horrified He rushes to Helen’s side

RYAN
Helen You okay

Helen just writhes on the ground totally dazed

INT OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS

Simon rubs his forehead as if his head is hurting

SIMON
It happened on the uh retreat
The St Stephen’s retreat You
thought you’d marry him someday

It’s like he’s hearing a voice inaudible to us and dictating
it Sister Fiona hangs on every word looking stunned

SIMON (CONTD)
But he came into your room It was
late and you were sleeping You
woke up and you weren’t scared
at first You wanted him to be
there But that changed

EXT ATHLETIC FIELD - SIMULTANEOUS

Ryan gets caught in the middle of a nasty RUGBY SCRUM He
collapses beneath a PILE OF CRAZED BOYS

INT OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS

A silent tear slides down Sister Fiona’s cheek She sits
frozen listening Simon talks faster now

SIMON

He forced you down on the bed and
the springs were hard and squeaky
really squeaky and he smelled like
altar wine and tic tacs peppermint
I think and some kind of shampoo
that he liked from the drug store
and he -

SISTER FIONA
Stop
EXT ATHLETIC FIELD - SIMULTANEOUS

Ryan runs with the ball He shakes off a couple opponents as
he races across the goal-line and scores

He stops to catch his breath while the white team CHEERS -

to the ground hurt Ike looks to Jay for approval Jay ROARS
with laughter and gives the victory sign

Sister Fiona stares off into space completely devastated
Simon shakes himself as if snapping out of a trance

All the color has drained from his face

SIMON (CONTD)

He staggers up rushes out of the room

INT CLASSROOM - TWILIGHT

The boys sit in a large classroom in long rows listening to
a tedious lecture about kindness from a priest before dinner
Ryan is in the back next to Helen He’s pretending to take
notes but secretly writing a letter to Emily

The DRONING of the priest’s voice FADES as we MOVE IN closer
on Ryan and his letter

RYAN (VO)
Em I don’t know if you’1ll ever get
this letter And not just because
of your dad The other kids say the
mail here gets censored so I’1l
keep it short and see what gets
through I found Simon

INT THE DORMITORY ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

Simon stands at the picture window again drawn to the
mountains and wilderness like a moth to flame

RYAN (VO)
He keeps to himself and seems
pretty depressed but I think he’1l
pull through

Simon is mouthing words and mumbling to himself as if
receiving otherworldly broadcasts from the landscape beyond

INT CLASSROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
We slowly MOVE IN closer to Ryan as he continues writing

RYAN (VO)
Life here is harsh Classes rugby
and prayer over and over again
And things are supposed to get
worse The weather’s closing in

EXT THE WILDERNESS - SIMULTANEOUS
Outside it’s snowing harder The sky is dark

RYAN (VO)
A few days from now we’ll be
completely cut off from the outside

tonight and they say that no one
will be able to come or go for a
long time

INT FATHER CLEARY’S QUARTERS - NIGHT

Father Cleary sits behind his vast desk Sipping a glass of
Scotch Looking out the window where snow is coming down
heavier now We can hear the HOWLINGWHISTLING sound

RYAN (VO)
The priests say we have enough
rations to last six months if need
be I guess this isolation is part
of our punishment

INT SISTER FIONA’S QUARTERS - NIGHT

Sister Fiona is kneeling by her bed praying fervently Tears
drip down her face The WHISTLING sound continues

RYAN (VO)
I’m going to look after Simon for
you Make sure nothing bad happens
to him I guess I deserve to be
here but Simon doesn’t

INT THE DORMITORY ROOM - NIGHT

Ryan lies in bed his eyes focused on the huge windows
Outside snow whips around frantically in what is quickly
becoming a blizzard The HOWLINGWHISTLING grows louder than
ever as if it’s the angry voice of the storm itself

RYAN (VO)
I hope you know how much I love
you Emily And how empty I feel
here without you

At last Ryan’s eyes close as he drifts off to sleep

FADE TO BLACK

HELEN (OVER BLACK)
Wake up Ryan Wake up They’re
gone

INT THE DORMITORY ROOM - DAY

Helen leans over the bed dressed in his uniform shaking
Ryan awake Ryan blinks sleep from his eyes

RYAN
Wha -

HELEN
All the grown-ups are gone The
priests The brothers All of them

Ryan immediately sits up in shock looks around the
dormitory It’s mostly empty Only a few scattered boys still
snooze in their bunks From 0S he hears EXCITED SHOUTS
echoing throughout the building

RYAN
What time is it

HELEN
Almost eleven They were supposed
to wake us up six hours ago but
they never did It’s like they just
vanished

Ryan swings his legs over the side of the bed and stands up

RYAN
That’s crazy Are you sure

HELEN
I don’t know how or why but we’re
alone here Just us kids

Ryan’s eyes go to the massive windows Snow drifts are piled
up over six feet high against the glass The school is snowed
in Ryan glances back at Helen Helen looks scared

ANOTHER ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER

Simon lays in his bunk sound asleep His blanket is only
halfway on the bed As if he’s kicked it off in his sleep

Ryan and Helen are standing over him Ryan pulls Simon’s
blanket back up

RYAN
At least he can finally get some
rest

(MORE )

RYAN (CONTD)
(looks at Helen)
Let’s find out what’s going on

INT CORRIDOR - DAY

Now in uniform Ryan strides down the corridor Helen at his
heels An excited trio of BOYS comes running in the other
direction

EXCITED BOY
Were free motherfuckers

The boys run past Ryan and Helen turn a corner WHOOPING it
up Helen watches them go with distaste as he tries to keep
up with Ryan

HELEN
You see I’ve already looked around
and I’m telling you I can’t find
anyone I don’t know where they
could be

Ryan seems determined to investigate this claim for himself
He continues down the hall

INT CAFETERIA - DAY

Ryan and Helen enter to find several small groups of BOYS
milling about talking Some of the tables and chairs have
been turned over as though there’s been a scuffle No sign
of any adults

Ryan hears CRASHING NOISES come from the kitchen and moves
toward it Helen follows Ryan pushes open the doors

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Boys are raiding the big refrigerators and pantries scarfing
down food A CHUBBY BOY is rifling through a freezer

CHUBBY BOY
I found the apple pies

All the boys are dressed in uniform but they’re already
disheveled after a morning with no supervision The sense of
freedom and excitement in the air is palpable

HELEN
You guys shouldn’t be doing this
You’11 all be in big trouble

IRRITATED BOY
Oh blow me Helen

Somebody else chucks an orange at Helen He ducks just in
time and the orange explodes on the wall behind him

HELEN
Hey Don’t you realize this might
be a test The priests could be
watching us right now

Ryan suddenly turns and leaves the room

HELEN (CONTD)
Wait Ryan Where are you going

Helen scurries after him as someone else whips a banana at
him Helen SQUEALS as it nails him in the ass The boys in
the kitchen crack up

INT BRIARCLIFF REFORM SCHOOL - DAY

Ryan rounds a corner and moves up some stairs Helen right
behind him like Ryan’s shadow A few boys mill about
aimlessly unsure what to do with their sudden freedom Some
have malevolent looks in their eyes Some look scared

Ryan enters into a corridor on the second floor He looks out
the windows getting a better view of the landscape

EXT BRIARCLIFF REFORM SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

There’s several feet of fresh snow on the ground The
landscape has been erased by whiteness Snow drifts are piled
up against the doors and lower windows of the school The
roof is covered with deep heavy snow and icicles are
starting to form

INT BRIARCLIFF REFORM SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS
Helen stands by Ryan taking in the blinding white vista

HELEN
They couldn’t be out there could
they They’d be frozen by now It
has to be a test They’re sitting
somewhere and watching us through
the surveillance cameras or
something

Ryan just moves off down the corridor Helen follows

HELEN (CONTD)
Ryan

Ryan glances into classrooms as he passes them They’re
empty

HELEN (CONTD)
I’ve already looked up here
There’s nobody

Ryan keeps looking He peers into another classroom where Ben
the tweaker has just finished scrawling a statement on the
chalkboard FATHER CLEARY SUCKS COCK

Ben spins around afraid He looks relieved when he sees
Ryan His eyes are huge and deranged

BEN
Fuck ‘em man Fuck ‘em all I’m
the king of the castle

Ryan moves on

ANOTHER ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER

Ryan moves up another level of stairs Helen hangs back
nervous From 0S SHOUTS and FOOTFALLS of boys running

loose echo below them

HELEN
What are you doing

Ryan stops at the top of the stairs He finds himself in an
empty common room A corridor stretches off before him

Helen creeps up the stairs

HELEN (CONTD)
This level is for adults only
We’re not supposed to be up here

RYAN
You haven’t checked up here

HELEN
Of course not

Ryan moves off down the corridor Helen hovers on the top
step terrified of planting his feet on this forbidden floor

HELEN (CONTD)
Ryan

We follow Ryan as he turns a corner and leaves Helen behind
Ryan finds himself in a hallway with doors on either side
Most of them are open He steps into the nearest room

INT FATHER O’BRIEN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The room is spartan The only real decoration is a large
Irish flag proudly displayed on the wall There’s a bookcase
full of leather bound titles and a dresser The bed is
unmade the covers thrown onto the floor

Ryan moves back into the corridor

INT BRIARCLIFF - UPPER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

Ryan moves past other rooms and finds more of the same
Simple rooms without many possessions All of the beds
unmade the covers often draped across the floor and no sign
of any of the adults

Ryan stops at the doorway to a different room and peers
inside

INT COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

This is a larger room Against the far wall is an oak table
with an old Ham radio atop it

Ryan enters the room Moves over to the table The bulky old
communication device has been brutally smashed As if someone
beat it to death with a club

On one wall racks of VCRs for the surveillance cameras have
been completely obliterated The machines and tapes are just
rubble

Ryan looks over at the corner where an old desktop computer
has also been destroyed The bulky monitor lays on the floor
its screen shattered

HELEN (0S)
Jeez Louise

Ryan jumps startled He turns to find Helen behind him
peering at the destroyed equipment in shock

HELEN (CONTD)
Who would do that I don’t like
this one bit

RYAN
The radio was for emergencies I’m
guessing

HELEN
(nodding)
I knew they had one somewhere
(MORE )

HELEN (CONTD)
There’s a phoneline that runs up
here but it usually goes out after
a storm like this

Helen sees something beneath the table Crouches down and
retrieves the handset of an old telephone The cord has been
cut

RYAN
Where’s the rest of it

The boys search the room Don’t find anything of use

RYAN (CONTD)
What about cellphones

HELEN
Even if we find one there’s no way
well get a signal up here

A sudden THUD comes from down the hall Both boys freeze
stare at each other with wide eyes

Ryan moves out of the room Helen is about to panic

HELEN (CONTD)
(whisper)
Ryan no

INT BRIARCLIFF - UPPER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

Ryan moves slowly down the corridor Hears another THUD It’s
coming from behind the closed door at the end of the hall

Helen peers from around the doorway of the communications
room He watches Ryan too scared to leave the room

HELEN
(whisper)
Ryan

Ryan ignores him Draws closer to the door He’s scared But
he needs to know what lies beyond the door

He slowly reaches out for the doorknob -

THUD Ryan nearly jumps out of his skin as there’s another
noise from inside the room He looks back to Helen Helen
shakes his head frantically motions for Ryan to come back

Ryan steels himself reaches for the knob again And
quickly throws open the door -

INT FATHER CLEARY’S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

Jay Ike and Sammy look at Ryan startled by his sudden
appearance The spacious room is well constructed of aged
dark wood A massive bookcase covers one entire wall Many of
the books have been torn up and mangled Another wall is
dominated by a window that looks out on the snowbound
wilderness

Jay is kicked back behind Father Cleary’s desk His feet up
he’s smoking a cigar and clutching a bottle of old Scotch
Ike and Sammy have been pulling drawers out of a big wooden
filing cabinet and dumping the contents out on the floor
They leer with menace at Ryan

JAY
Ever heard of knocking

He takes a monster swig of booze while Ike and Sammy cackle

RYAN
What are you guys doing in here

SAMMY
What’s it to you dickwad You
gonna snitch on us

Ike steps forward

JAY
Boys boys Relax Let him in

Ike and Sammy back off as Ryan steps into the room Jay
offers him the bottle

JAY (CONTD)
Want a swig

Ryan shakes his head No

IKE
Pussy

Ike takes the bottle from Jay and downs some Scotch

RYAN
You guys seen anybody Any of the
grownups I mean I’m trying to
figure out what’s going on

JAY
No but we’ve been finding some
very interesting stuff in Cleary’s
files

RYAN
Any idea what happened

IKE
Who cares

He downs another slug of Scotch passes the bottle back to
Jay Helen appears in the doorway peeks cautiously inside

HELEN
Oh man You guys are gonna get
it
Ike and Sammy laugh at him

SAMMY
We’re sooooco scared

Sammy suddenly walks forward and cuffs Helen on top of his
head

HELEN
Ow

Ryan grabs Sammy’s arm

RYAN
Leave him alone

Sammy shakes Ryan off instantly ready to fight

SAMMY
What you gonna do about it new
fish

RYAN

(getting pissed off)
Hey what the hell is wrong with
you Every single adult at
Briarcliff is missing but all
you care about is swinging your
dick around to impress Jay

Sammy grabs Ryan’s shirt and the two scuffle for a moment
Helen cowers behind Ryan

JAY
Not in my office

Sammy backs off as Jay steps around the desk He takes
another sip of Scotch

RYAN
Look did you guys smash the radio
and the computer

JAY
No But we made a pretty good mess
of this room

Jay gazes around happily
JAY (CONTD)
In fact I may just take a shit on
old Cleary’s pillow before I leave

Ike and Sammy crack up

HELEN
Ryan let’s -

JAY
(interrupting)
As I was saying Ryan these files
have been very revealing

He pulls something out of his pocket
JAY (CONTD)
Including this little piece of ass
right here

It’s Ryan’s confiscated photo of Emily Jay holds it up and
dangles it back and forth Ryan darts toward Jay

RYAN
Give me that

Ike tries to grab him around the waist but Ryan spins around

and decks the guy Ike hits the floor stunned gasping for
air

Sammy jumps Ryan starts throwing punches Ryan doesn’t
hesitate he meets Sammy head on his anger completely taking
over They start brawling on the floor

Ryan beats Sammy back but Ike gets up again and starts
walloping Ryan Soon he and Sammy have the advantage

Helen cowers in the doorway watching Jay just sits back
against the desk amused

Ryan yanks himself free of the skirmish steps back
breathing hard nose bleeding Sammy and Ike stand before
Jay like a couple of guard dogs ready for more

JAY
Temper temper
(smirks )
Youre like my old man

RYAN
And youre a pussy Jay You know
that You’re afraid to get your
hands dirty I’1l take you one on
one any day

JAY
That’s a delightful promise Ryan
and I look forward to it

He flourishes the photo of Emily again

JAY (CONTD)
But I just want you to know that
tonight I’m gonna jack off all
over your girlfriend’s face

INT BRIARCLIFF - UPPER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

Ryan storms out of the room and down the corridor as the
boys’ LAUGHTER resounds behind him Helen tries to keep up

HELEN
Don’t let them get to you Ryan
They’re troglodytes

Ryan turns the corner nearly blind with anger and heads
downstairs

INT COMMON ROOM - FIRST LEVEL - A BIT LATER

Ryan and Helen move into the vast room There’s a small stage
at one end with a PA system that looks like it hasn’t been
used in ages An enormous chandelier dangles from the
ceiling

A few BOYS mill about One KID runs by and launches up a roll
of toilet paper It sails through the air like a white
streamer then drops down over the chandelier draping it
The boys CHEER

HELEN
I feel like I took a time machine
back to third grade

Ryan’s eyes focus on the PA system
RYAN

Helen can you do me a favor Go
get me your iPod

HELEN
(taken aback)
I don’t know Ryan Nobody knows
I have it
RYAN
(insistent)
Just get it for me will you
Helen turns on his heel and scurries away
ANOTHER ANGLE - A BIT LATER
Ryan is monkeying around with the PA system when Helen scoots
back into the room He moves up onto the stage Looks around
to make sure no one is watching then furtively slips his
iPod out of his pocket and hands it to Ryan

Ryan scrolls through the music for a moment He looks up at
Helen surprised

RYAN (CONTD)
You got some good stuff on here

HELEN
What’d you expect American Idol
INT EMPTY CORRIDOR - DAY

All of a sudden DISTANT MUSIC resounds down the hallway
Another Brick in the Wall Part 2 by Pink Floyd

PINK FLOYD
We dont need no education

TWO BOYS appear from around the corner mesmerized

PINK FLOYD (CONTD)
We dont need no thought control

The boys move forward seeking out the source of the music

INT CLASSROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

Ben is pulling papers out of a priest’s desk and throwing
them around the room when he hears

PINK FLOYD
No dark sarcasm in the classroom

He freezes papers drifting down around him listening

INT THE DORMITORY - SIMULTANEOUS
Boys come out of the dormitory drawn out by the song

PINK FLOYD
Teacher leave them kids alone

They file out the doors passing beneath the SUFFER THE
LITTLE CHILDREN UNTO ME carving

PINK FLOYD (CONTD)
Hey Teacher Leave them kids
alone

INT CAFETERIA - SIMULTANEOUS

The place has grown messy as hungry boys have scavenged for
food But now everyone is riveted by the music

PINK FLOYD
All in all its just another brick
in the wall

They move out of the kitchen away from the tables everyone
flooding out of the cafeteria

PINK FLOYD (CONTD)
All and all youre just another
brick in the wall

INT COMMON ROOM - FIRST LEVEL - SIMULTANEOUS
Boys are quickly filling the room their eyes on -

Ryan He stands on stage the iPod held over his head He has
it wired into the PA system The volume is deafening in here
Helen stands shyly off to the side

And now the song reaches one of the most inspired rallying
cries in all of rock ‘n’ roll That fed-up choir of
disaffected British schoolboys proclaiming

PINK FLOYD
We dont need no education We
dont need no thought control

More and more boys pour into the room They look at Ryan with
something like reverence These kids haven’t heard music in
so long Nor have they had access to gadgets like iPods

PINK FLOYD (CONTD)
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone

Jay and Ike and Sammy looking arrogant and drunk are among
the last stragglers to come into the room Most of the other
boys are smiling now Some even HOLLER and CHEER as the song
builds to its most sublimely defiant moment

PINK FLOYD (CONTD)
HEY TEACHER LEAVE US KIDS ALONE

Ryan brings down the iPod Kills the music The assembled
boys settle down look at him expectantly

RYAN
Something we can’t explain has
happened here

The kids seem eager for more except Jay and his buddies who
glare at Ryan drunkenly Ryan suddenly looks a little nervous
to be standing in front of this huge crowd He plows ahead

RYAN (CONTD)
Has anyone seen any of the priests
Or the brothers

The boys look around at each other shaking their heads

RYAN (CONTD)
What about the nuns

HORNY KID
They’re gone too But Sister Fiona
left these behind

The HORNY KID swings a pair of white cotton panties around in
the air The others CHEER him on A couple kids try to snatch
the panties away from him but he holds on tight

RYAN
(louder )
So we’re all alone then

RANDOM VOICE
Tell us something we don’t know

The noise of the crowd rises up for a moment but then
quietens back down It seems like most of the kids want to at
least give Ryan a chance to talk

RYAN
And because of the blizzard we’re
stranded up here without any way to
get out We have food we have
shelter but not a hell of a lot
else -

ANOTHER RANDOM VOICE
Turn the music back on douchebag

The crowd starts to get noisy again

RYAN
Listen - Listen The staff could
have been in some kind of accident
or gone outside in the snow and got
lost or I don’t know or -

Helen moves forward from the edge of the stage and pipes up

HELEN
Or this could be a test And maybe
if we pass it they’1l let us go
home We have to do the right thing-

The crowd instantly starts shouting him down

RANDOM VOICE
Fuck you faggot

A piece of garbage sails by Helen’s head More debris follow
and Helen ducks Everyone is BOOING and YELLING at him

RYAN
(to Helen)
Just let me handle this okay

Helen looks hurt but nods He steps back to safety at the
edge of the stage

RYAN (CONTD)
Look We have to find out what’s
going on Where everyone went
Because if something bad happened
to them it might happen to us
next

The crowd is quieter again like they hadn’t considered that
possibility

RYAN (CONTD)
I mean I’m glad the staff is gone
Especially that asshole Grimes

A bunch of the kids voice their assent
RYAN (CONTD)
I guess we’re free now But we need
to be smart about what we do next
A lone drunken voice blares out disrupting the silence
JAY

(challenging)
So what’s your plan smart guy

Ryan looks out at the crowd He knows if he says the wrong
thing he’ll lose his tenuous control over them He has to
balance his concerns with those of the group

RYAN
My plan

He smiles

RYAN (CONTD)
My plan is that we spend the
afternoon in here - those of us who
want to - tossing out ideas trying
to figure out what happened and
maybe how to get out of this
place

His words trail off

RYAN (CONTD)
And then we all grab as much
alcohol as we can find and have a
big fucking party and get shitfaced
tonight

Helen winces as the crowd goes nuts

INT COMMON ROOM - FIRST LEVEL - NIGHT

The iPod is blaring Biggie Smalls as the kids riot and party
in the main room We see chalkboards up on the stage with all
kinds of lists and ideas about the disappearance from the
afternoon’s brainstorming session They include everything
from “Alien abduction” to “Group suicide” to “God made them
disappear” None of the theories strike us as very plausible

A drunken Jay leaves the safety of his friends and heads
toward Ryan

JAY
My boy

As Ryan turns to look he sees one of the younger kids ERIC stumble into Jay’s path Jay instantly shoves the boy
out of his way Eric sprawls to the floor face first

RYAN
(moving forward)
Hey
Jay grins as Eric gets up and hustles away in fear

JAY
He’1ll be fine

RYAN
(turning to walk away)
I’ve got nothing to say to you

JAY
No seriously Wait -

Jay catches up to him Ryan pauses

JAY (CONTD)
Listen I just wanna say I’m sorry
for earlier I don’t play nice with
people is all

He chuckles ruefully

JAY (CONTD)
Guess that’s why I got sent here

He suddenly digs in his pocket almost impulsively Ryan
stares at him warily

JAY (CONTD)
Might as well give this back to
you

He takes out the photo of Emily and holds it out to Ryan
like a peace offering

JAY (CONTD)
Be careful it’s kind of sticky

Ryan shoots him a pissed-off look Jay laughs
JAY (CONTD)
Lighten up dude I’m kidding You
gotta control that temper
Ryan takes the photo from him and puts it in his pocket
JAY (CONTD)
Seriously though That was cool
with the iPod How’d you smuggle
that in

RYAN
I didn’t Helen did

JAY
Helen

He shakes his head bemused

JAY (CONTD)
Who woulda thought

INT EXT BACK OF THE SCHOOL - SIMULTANEOUS

Simon stands at an open doorway Gusts of snow blow into the
room from outside It’s windy dark and freezing but Simon
doesn’t seem to notice In the distance we can hear the
thump of the BASS from the party

Ben comes stumbling down a corridor clutching an arm-load of
wine bottles He’s already hammered

BEN
Lookie what I found

Simon doesn’t turn around he just walks out into the snow
eyes blank

Ben watches him for a moment confused Then he moves on
wanting to get back to the party

INT COMMON ROOM - FIRST LEVEL - NIGHT

Some of the kids are lighting toilet paper rolls on fire and
tossing them off a balcony The music has switched and now
Slayer’s South of Heaven is blasting at maximum volume

HELEN
I don’t know if this was such a
good idea

RYAN
They would have partied anyway

HELEN
All the ideas we came up with
They’re garbage yknow

Helen glances at the chalkboards

HELEN (CONTD)
I mean unless we believe in aliens-

RYAN
Hey you seen Simon anywhere

HELEN
I’m sure he’s around somewhere
He’s always around Just
drifting

EXT WILDERNESS - SIMULTANEOUS

Simon is wading uphill through the thick snow trudging
forward slowly He is all alone and not dressed for the cold

His glazed eyes are fixed straight ahead as though some
unseen presence is calling for him We hear the noise of the
wind over the crevice loud and ominous HOWLING ceaselessly
from somewhere ahead

INT COMMON ROOM - FIRST LEVEL - NIGHT

The party is getting even wilder now Kids are running back
and forth and slamdancing to the music One of them leaps off
the stage and tackles another It’s a crazed testosterone
frenzy Broken wine bottles litter the floor Ben is sitting
in a corner gibbering to himself as he sloshes red wine all
over his head

Ryan sits against a wall next to Helen Jay and his cronies
slump next to them along with a handful of other RANDOM
GUYS All of them are totally wasted

Helen tries to say something but just mumbles indecipherable
words and nearly falls over Ryan turns slowly to look at
him

RYAN
How much have you had to drink

HELEN
(barely lucid)
Maybe half a glass
Ryan laughs Helen looks kind of sick

HELEN (CONTD)
I’m not used to drinking

Jay leans over with a bottle of wine It’s like the alcohol
has mellowed him At least for the moment

JAY
We’re gonna have to change that
Drink up son

He offers Helen the bottle Helen weakly tries to push it
away

JAY (CONTD)
C’mon you know you want it

The guys including Ryan start to chant

GUYS
Drink Drink Drink

Helen grabs the bottle and puts it to his lips and starts
chugging The guys erupt in a CHEER

EXT THE WILDERNESS - SIMULTANEOUS

Simon stands like a spectral presence at the top of a snowy
ridge He gazes down at the valleys and peaks that sprawl in
front of him under the moonlight The HOWLINGWHISTLING sound
is louder so loud that we can hear nothing else He begins
lurching forward again Behind him we see the school in the
distance getting smaller as he heads further into the heart
of the wilderness

INT HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING

Ryan is asleep in a wide marble hallway underneath a giant
stained glass window of the Virgin Mary His shirt is off
but he’s got a thin blanket half-wrapped around him He looks
oddly peaceful

Then we hear a huge CRASHING SOUND come from directly outside
the school Ryan wakes up woozily blinking his eyes against
the daylight Like he’s suffering the mother of all
hangovers

He hears another crashing sound and flinches startled He
sits up wrapping the blanket around his shoulders Slowly
he staggers to his feet He looks down and sees wine bottles
everywhere

RYAN
Fuck

He holds onto the wall for a moment like his vision is
swimming Ryan heads toward the open front doors moving
carefully

INT EXT FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

Ryan stands at the doorway blinking against the glare of
bright sunlight on the snow His breath is white in the
freezing air

He instantly sees the source of the noise A group of boys is
tearing down the statues in front of the school They are
armed with hammers and other tools Some are kicking at the
statues with their bare feet Ryan sees familiar figures in
the midst of the fray Jay Ike and Sammy

EXT BRIARCLIFF REFORM SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

Ryan walks down the steps toward the mob The other kids
notice him Ike and Sammy glare at him but Jay starts
walking toward him beaming as he stretches his arms out
surveying his destruction

He’s holding a hammer in one hand and a wine bottle in the
other like the party hasn’t ended for him

JAY
You like my work

RYAN
It’s probably not the best use of
your energy
JAY
(frowns )
You’re more fun when you’re drunk
He holds out the bottle and the hammer

JAY (CONTD)

Pick one
RYAN
I’m okay
(suddenly sounding
worried)

You seen Simon today
Jay shakes his head

RYAN (CONTD)
What about Helen

JAY
Your butt buddy Last I saw he was
licking wine off the floor

From behind them come more noises of DESTRUCTION and then
CHEERS as another statue is deposed

RYAN
We shouldn’t trash the school We
should just find a way to get out

of here

JAY
You haven’t seen anything yet I’ve
got big plans for Briarcliff I’m

gonna turn this place into a
fucking crater and then burn the
ashes

RYAN

And I’m telling you that’s a total
waste of time We’ll just get in
more trouble and end up in juvie
We need to search this place not
tear it down Helen thinks they’ve
got snowmobiles somewhere We can
drive out of here and find help

JAY
I don’t need any help

He raises his hammer and his wine bottle flourishing them
gleefully

JAY (CONTD)
I got everything I need

Ryan sighs irritated But he realizes there’s no use trying
to reason with Jay Jay turns back to commit more acts of
wanton destruction Ryan heads inside the school

INT CAFETERIA - DAY

Ryan enters the cafeteria in search of water and food The
entire place has been trashed Other kids are in here
picking over the food on the floor Ryan spies a box of
cereal on top of a cabinet and grabs it

He notices a figure hunched over one of the long tables It
takes him a second to realize that it’s a very hungover
Helen Ryan walks over to him Helen raises his head

HELEN
Thank God It’s you I feel like
I’m going to die

Ryan sits down bemused

RYAN
It’s called a hangover

He picks up a half-empty wine bottle from the floor and hands
it to Helen

RYAN (CONT’D)
Drink this and you’1l feel better

Helen leans over and throws up

RYAN (CONT’D)
Or not

Ryan opens the box of cereal and eats a handful Helen wipes
his mouth and looks up at him

HELEN
What are we going to do Ryan
Things are already falling apart
and it’s only been one day

RYAN
You weren’t complaining last night

HELEN
I don’t know what I was thinking
It’s not like me to act that way

RYAN
Have you seen Simon I don’t
remember seeing him around last
night

HELEN
I don’t remember anything about
last night

Ryan looks around the room Tables are turned over others
have been smashed to pieces Boys sit and eat in this
wreckage like wartime survivors

RYAN
We should have gone looking for the
adults yesterday If they’re out in
the snow somewhere -

HELEN
They’re probably dead by now

RYAN
(beat)
Are there really snowmobiles here

HELEN
(nodding)
I think so There’s a garage out
back but I’ve never been inside

EXT GARAGE - BACK OF THE SCHOOL - DAY

Ryan and Helen stand in front of the big roll-up door to the
windowless brick garage The door is held shut with a
massive iron lock

HELEN
How are we going to open this up

Ryan is frowning like he already knows the answer but
doesn’t want to say

HELEN (CONTD)
Ryan We could try to find the key
but that might take hours -

RYAN
Just come with me

EXT FRONT OF THE SCHOOL - DAY

Ryan and Helen are talking to Jay and his friends Other kids
continue to run around in the snow defacing the school and
breaking windows

JAY
So now you need my help is what
youre saying

RYAN
Something like that

Jay looks at Ike and Sammy Ike is clutching a crowbar Sammy
holds a large mallet Behind them Ben is bashing away on a
statue with a hammer There’s a nasty gash on his forehead
and he looks more crazed than ever All of them stop working
when they notice Jay staring at them

JAY
Should we help Ryan and Helen
boys

IKE

Only if we get to kick the shit
outta them afterwards

Helen looks horrified Ike brandishes his crowbar

JAY
Sounds like a deal

Ben raises his hammer and HOWLS like a wolf

EXT GARAGE - BACK OF THE SCHOOL - DAY

Ryan Helen Jay Ike Sammy Ben and a few hangers-on stand
in front of the garage door

JAY
Let’s get to it

He steps back as Ike and Sammy move in with the crowbar and
mallet They start attacking the lock It soon shatters and
falls into the snow

Helen looks at Ryan startled

HELEN
That was easier than I thought

Ike leans down and starts pulling open the door The boys
crowd around trying to see into the darkness

INTEXT GARAGE - BACK OF THE SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

The space is cavernous and dusty The passenger van that Ryan
arrived in is parked here Next to it a tarp covers two big
lumps

Ben instantly and inexplicably starts attacking the
windshield of the van with his hammer

BEN
Suck my balls Big Juicy

The windshield starts to splinter and crack but the other
kids pretty much ignore his antics Jay tears off the tarp
revealing two gleaming well-maintained snowmobiles
underneath Ryan and Helen stand back

JAY
Shiny shiny

Jay hops on one and starts checking it out Sammy gets on
the other one

IKE
Hey man I wanna go first

Sammy ignores him tries to figure out how to start the
engine

Ryan looks around the garage Old equipment and tools are
piled against the walls and on shelves Against the far wall
is an old gasoline pump

Ryan pulls open a closet and finds several heavy-duty snow
jackets hanging on rusty pegs A few pairs of cross-country
skis lean in one corner

JAY
How do you start this thing

Helen plucks a key-ring off a nail on the wall
HELEN

I imagine these might help
EXT BACK OF THE SCHOOL - A BIT LATER
Most of the boys have gathered to watch Jay zoom around on
one of the snowmobiles Sammy drives the other one Ike
sitting behind him holding him around the waist They HOOT
and HOLLER as they navigate the open terrain having a

blast

Ryan and Helen stand in the knee-deep snow Watching

RYAN
Think we could make it to the
nearest town with these

Helen fiddles with his hearing aid frowning

HELEN
It’s a hundred miles away You’d
be lucky to make twenty-five miles
a day in this weather And it’d be
really easy to lose the road

RYAN
That’s not the answer I was hoping
for

HELEN

(as if to himself)
And I don’t know how you’d keep
warm at night

(shivers )
Or even during the day You’d be
exposed to the elements the whole -

BEN (0S)
The elements dude

Ryan and Helen turn to find Ben stumbling toward them

BEN (CONTD)
The elements You’re talking about
the snow and the ice and shit
right

Helen nods

BEN (CONTD)
Well check this out Last night I
saw one kid walk off into the snow
like it was no big deal man I’m
telling you the cold didn’t bother
him at all He just took off on his
own Never even looked back

Ben cackles

RYAN
(suddenly interested)
Who was it

BEN
I dunno but that little fucker had
balls man

Ryan gets in Ben’s face trying to make him concentrate Ryan
looks worried

RYAN
Tell me who it was

Ben peers at him with glazed wobbly eyes that slowly come
into focus

BEN
That freaky little kid who looks
like he’s on downers Harry Potter
on acid

Ryan steps back

RYAN
Simon

HELEN
He’s probably lying

RYAN
(to Ben)
Which way did he go

BEN
Chill dude -

Ben suddenly looks over as Jay makes a loud tight turn
throwing up snow on a nearby group of boys Ben starts
laughing and making MONKEY NOISES

Ryan grabs Ben

RYAN
Tell me where he went

Ben points up the mountain

BEN
Up there

Something catches Helen’s attention

HELEN
Look -

Ryan and Ben look over to see Jay gunning his engine
speeding directly at Sammy and Ike Sammy hasn’t noticed yet
He just cruises along on the snowmobile while Jay careens
toward him and Ike from the side Ryan immediately realizes
this has the potential for total disaster

RYAN
Hey STOP

Sammy looks over with wide eyes as he sees Jay flying toward
him Jay looks crazy as he pushes his snowmobile on even
faster

Ryan runs toward them waving his arms

RYAN (CONTD)
STOP

Sammy desperately swerves to the side as Jay clips their
snowmobile with his Sammy and Ike fly off landing heavily
in the deep snow Their snowmobile zooms forward another
fifty feet and then comes to a clattering stop against the
ridge of a snowbank

Jay turns around jumps off his snowmobile cackling in
triumph He looks around proudly at all the boys assembled

JAY
Whos the man

He gazes over at Ike and Sammy with contempt They are
pulling themselves out of the snow pissed off

JAY (CONTD)
Chickenshits

Ryan advances on Jay

RYAN
What the hell are you doing You
want to destroy our snowmobiles
Theyre probably the only way out
of here And you’re wasting fuel

Jay is taken aback by Ryan’s abrasive tone

JAY
Hey man fuck off You fall down
and bruise your vagina or
something

RYAN
Don’t you realize we need these
things Don’t you get it Or are
you really as stupid as you look

The other boys watch with interest Jay’s face is flushed
From the cold and also from sudden embarrassment at being
called out by Ryan

JAY
(low voice)
Don’t talk to me like that Not
ever You don’t know me

Ryan steps toward the snowmobile

RYAN
Listen I’m taking this I think
Simon wandered into the snow last
night I have to go find him before
it’s too late

Jay lunges forward and grabs Ryan’s shoulder spinning him
around

JAY
Hey asshole You’re not going -

Ryan punches Jay in the face Jay drops to the snow stunned
by the force of the blow Some of the kids applaud Others
BOO and yell for more violence

Jay glares up at Ryan from the snow full of dazed rage and
humiliation His lip and his nose are bleeding badly He
tries to get up but he’s still in shock Ryan steps back
clutching his own hand

Jay Manages to raise his head and look over at Ike and Sammy
They’re just standing there still brushing snow off
themselves

JAY (CONTD)
(weakly)
Do something

They look at Ryan But they don’t do anything All the other
boys are still watching Ryan turns to address them

RYAN
I’m going to go look for Simon
Will anyone come with me Will
anyone help

The boys all stand there awkwardly Scared to venture out
into the wilderness Helen looks conflicted too He keeps his
mouth shut

RYAN (CONTD)
Fine

He gets on the snowmobile After a couple tries he fires it
up He starts to pull away slowly heading up the mountain

HELEN (0S)
Wait Ryan

Ryan stops as Helen runs up to him out of breath Helen is
holding one of the big jackets from the closet in the garage

HELEN (CONTD)
Take this

Helen hands him the jacket and Ryan puts it on Then Ryan
guns the engine and takes off into the wilderness throwing
up a sheet of snow behind him

Jay is sitting up now He stares after Ryan his eyes burning
with hurt and rage

Helen is also watching as Ryan becomes smaller and smaller
a black speck in the wilderness Finally the snowmobile
passes over a ridge and disappears from sight

Helen sighs and turns to head back into the school But his
path is blocked Jay stands there smiling menacingly his
teeth stained red with blood

Helen shrinks back as Jay raises his meaty fist

JAY
Lights out

His fist slams down as we CUT TO

EXT WILDERNESS - DAY

Ryan traverses a miniature valley where the mountain dips
down for awhile before steadily rising again There is
nothing but virgin snow here white and glistening like a
glacier The snowmobile cuts a distinct path through the
powder

ANOTHER ANGLE - LATER

Ryan reaches a craggy peak He stops the snowmobile Looks
back The school is far below him now There are still some
boys out back but they are barely visible from up here

A blistering wind has kicked up Ryan pulls the big hood over
his head huddles up cold in spite of its bulk

The mountain dips down again into a rocky area with large
boulders scattered about There is no sign of Simon anywhere

Ryan moves forward on the snowmobile He has to go slower
now carefully maneuvering around the rocks Ahead of him
the creepy HOWLING SOUND from the crevice has begun its
unholy lament

EXT CAVES - LATER

The HOWLINGWHISTLING is much louder here Ryan moves very
slowly on the snowmobile

The wind has grown even stronger throwing up blinding gusts
of snow in Ryan’s path making it impossible to see The pine
trees buckle and bend around him A few snowflakes start to
fall

Ryan is freezing But he keeps moving determined to find
Simon

Ryan suddenly catches a glimpse of something in the snow
ahead He veers sideways and comes to a stop peers forward
and sees -

A white hand sticking up out of the snow

Ryan jumps off the snowmobile He dashes ahead drops to his
knees by the hand It’s clear that someone is buried beneath
the snow

Ryan starts feverishly digging his hands freezing and raw

Just beyond Ryan is the mouth of a massive cave staring
outward like a black abyss The HOWLING sound screams at Ryan
from the cave’s opening as he digs away

RYAN
(panicked)
Please don’t be Simon Please don’t
be Simon

Ryan digs a few more handfuls away and then stops in
surprise He has uncovered the face of Father O’Brien The
priest’s face is frozen in an agonized scream his eyes wide
staring at Ryan with a disturbing mix of terror and anguish

Ryan drops back to the snow The priest is clearly dead And
although Ryan is scared he also looks relieved it isn’t
Simon

Ryan is shivering It’s snowing hard now He glances over at
the cave The HOWLING is almost unbearable here but the cave
is also the only place to seek temporary shelter until the
storm passes

Ryan staggers up and heads toward the cave

INTEXT CAVES - CONTINUOUS

Ryan moves into the opening and passes through the darkness
The HOWLINGWHISTLING takes on a harrowing intimate quality
in here as if the sound is echoing inside Ryan’s skull

Ryan rounds a bend and to his surprise sees faint light
ahead He moves cautiously forward Various other openings in
the cave appear here and there leading off in multiple
directions like a labyrinth But Ryan stays focused on the
light keeps moving

As Ryan nears another bend in the cave he kicks something
with his foot He bends down picks up a discarded nun’s
habit As he looks at it disturbed he hears -

A sudden movement in the darkness of a tunnel that breaks off

from the main cave

Ryan freezes He peers into the tunnel

RYAN
Hello
(no answer)
Simon Is that you

Still nothing Ryan drops the nun’s habit He glances back
like he’s considering heading outside But then he moves away
from the tunnel opening and rounds the next bend

INT EXT THE CREVICE - CONTINUOUS

Ahead the cave opens up again on one side revealing a cliff
overlooking the vast snowy wilderness A FIGURE is on his
knees in the center of the cave bent over something his
back to Ryan

RYAN
Simon

The HOWLING is all-encompassing here Ryan’s voice can barely
be heard above it He dashes forward

As he gets closer he sees that the figure is indeed Simon
The boy is kneeling in front of a jagged crevice in the rock
floor peering down into the depths of the hole

Ryan drops to Simon’s side The wind whips at both of them
incessantly Simon grabs the kid SCREAMS to be heard over
the HOWLING

RYAN (CONTD)
Simon Are you alright

Simon looks like he’s in a trance His face is riddled with
black spots of frostbite He doesn’t seem aware of the
freezing temperature or his injuries He just peers down into
the crevice that HOWLING WHISTLE screaming up at him from
unimaginable depths

RYAN (CONTD)
Simon

Ryan shakes the boy but gets no response Ryan glances down
into the crevice and -

The HOWLING sound suddenly shifts from its abrasive lament to
a BEAUTIFUL TUNE (echoing the song Ryan and Emily were
listening to when they almost made love)

Faint swirling colors appear within the crevice like some
strange and exquisite alien constellation

Ryan is confused puzzled But he can’t look away We hear a
soft ETHEREAL VOICE whispering above the music

EMILY (0S)
Ryan You came for me

RYAN
(whispering)
Emily

Ryan falls to his knees next to Simon

EMILY (0S)
Ryan its so beautiful down
here Dont you see that we could
be together now Forever Come
to me Ryan

FLASH TO

EXT DREAM MEADOW - RYAN’S VISION - DAY

Emily floats naked in a sea of billowing purple roses that
rise and flutter like ocean waves

INT EXT THE CREVICE - RESUME

Ryan is totally mesmerized by the bizarre and alluring image
He bends closer to the crevice its psychedelic lights
reflecting on his slack face

EMILY (0S)
But Im so cold Ryan I need you
with me I need to feel your
warmth again

As Ryan bends closer to the hole captivated a sudden gust
of wind rocks the cliff face shaking an icicle free from the
mouth of the cave and blowing it inward The icicle hits the
ground and shatters into a thousand pieces with an EXPLOSIVE
CRASH

Ryan jerks up his trance broken He reels for a moment and
then pushes himself up and away from the crevice

He staggers to his feet and looks down at Simon The kid is
still peering into the depths of the crevice

RYAN
Simon Come on

Although Ryan has no idea what just happened to him he knows
that they have to get away from the crevice

Ryan steps forward and puts his arms under Simon’s shoulders

anking him up Simon doesn’t fight He just collapses back
into Ryan’s arms almost comatose his eyes rolling back in
their sockets

Ryan drags Simon away from the crevice back toward the front
of the cave

INT BRIARCLIFF REFORM SCHOOL - TWILIGHT

Helen stands anxiously by one of the huge picture windows on
the second level He sports a swollen black eye courtesy of
Jay He stares out into the wilderness Fresh snow is still

coming down

Suddenly he sees Ryan’s snowmobile appear over a ridge in
the distance He watches it for a moment like he can’t
believe what he’s seeing Then he turns and races down the
stairs

EXT BACK OF THE SCHOOL - A BIT LATER

Helen huddles against the freezing gloom as Ryan pulls up in
the snowmobile He’s driving with one hand His other arm is
wrapped around Simon who is hunched in front of him wearing
the big jacket

HELEN
Oh my God

Helen runs up to Ryan as he stops and climbs off the
snowmobile With no jacket on Ryan is wet freezing and
miserable-looking

HELEN (CONTD)
You found him Is he alive

Ryan picks Simon up too exhausted to even answer

HELEN (CONTD)
Come on I built a fire

Helen leads the way as Ryan carries Simon toward the school

INT COMMON ROOM - FIRST LEVEL - MOMENTS LATER

A fire roars away in the huge fireplace at one end of the
room Several of the YOUNGER BOYS including Eric are
crowded around it roasting hotdogs

Helen leads Ryan into the room He frowns when he sees the
boys in front of the fire

HELEN
Out of the way The fire’s not for
you

The boys move away when they see Ryan carrying Simon Ryan
staggers the last few paces up to the fireplace and sets
Simon carefully in front of it Then he sits heavily next to
him trying to get warm

Helen looks Simon over while other boys hear the commotion
and start crowding around Simon is unconscious His eyes
move rapidly beneath the lids like he’s dreaming

HELEN (CONTD)
Give us some room here

The boys back off a bit Helen inspects Simon’s face The
black spots of frostbite look even worse by the light of the
fire

KID
What’s wrong with his face

HELEN
Frostbite He needs a doctor

Helen looks at Ryan

HELEN (CONTD)
You saved his life

Ryan doesn’t respond He’s still trying to get warm Helen
looks back at Simon

HELEN (CONTD)
We need to get him out of these wet
clothes You too Ryan
Ryan starts to pull off his wet shirt

HELEN (CONTD)
Are you hungry Thirsty

Ryan nods Helen points at a kid

HELEN (CONTD)
Finish cooking that hotdog and give
it to Ryan
(points to Eric)
Eric Go find some blankets and hot
water

The little kids obey Helen Ryan has to smile a bit amused
by Helen’s sudden assertiveness Then he notices Helen’s eye

RYAN
Who gave you that shiner

HELEN
Who do you think

Ryan sighs Helen grins

HELEN (CONTD)
But I don’t think Jay’s going to
bother us anymore

Ryan looks confused

HELEN (CONTD)
When Simon’s doing better I’1l
show you what I mean

INT LARGE STOCKROOM - NIGHT

Ryan and Helen enter a huge room stocked with rows of
supplies for the school Most of the room has been trashed
Ike and Sammy are lounging against a locked door that leads
to a storage closet sharing a bottle of wine

Ryan stops Turns to Helen and looks at him quizzically
Helen gestures at the locked door

HELEN
Jays new home

Ike and Sammy glare at Ryan

IKE
We’re guarding him We’re not
letting him out

RYAN
I thought you guys were his
friends

IKE
We got sick of him telling us what
to do -

SAMMY
And bossing us around -

Jay suddenly starts YELLING and CURSING from within the
storage room Ike hammers on the door

IKE
Shut up

Jay falls silent Sammy and Ike glare at Ryan and Helen

SAMMY
Jays an asshole
RYAN
I’m not gonna disagree
SAMMY
(sneers )

But that doesn’t mean we’re your
friends now If you don’t watch
yourself we might lock you up too

Jay starts HOLLERING again from within the room Ike and
Sammy start kicking the door and taunting him

IKE
There’s a new sheriff in town you
punk-ass bitch

Helen looks unnerved by their violent attitude Ryan turns
and leaves Helen scurries after him

INT COMMON ROOM - FIRST LEVEL - SIMULTANEOUS

Simon still lies in front of the fire A bunch of the younger
boys are crowded around peering down at him like he’s an
alien creature

Simon opens his eyes Then he sits up in a smooth sudden
gesture startling the boys

YOUNG KID
Youre awake

Simon looks at the boy There’s a new look in Simon’s eyes a
cold clinically detached gaze that wasn’t there before

ANOTHER YOUNG KID
Helen says you got frostbite

Simon regards this kid for a moment Then he raises his right
hand and opens his palm slowly flexing his fingers The boys
watch

YOUNG KID
What are you doing

Simon ignores him stares at his hand Concentrating

INT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Ryan and Helen are heading back toward the common room

HELEN
It’s crazy right After Jay
punched me Ike and Sammy jumped
him and beat him up Other kids
joined in They were so sick of him
picking on everybody

RYAN
I guess that’s a good thing But
well have to watch Ike and Sammy
They’re even dumber than Jay and
that could make them more dangerous-

Ahead they hear sounds of EXCITEMENT coming from the common
room And frantic FOOTSTEPS pounding towards them

INT ANOTHER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Ryan and Helen pause in surprise Two of the younger kids who
were with Simon at the fire practically run into them They
both look frenzied

ERIC
Come quick It’s Simon

HELEN
What’s wrong

BOY 2
I’ve never seen anything like it

They all start rushing back to the common room

RYAN
Is he okay What’s going on

ERIC
He’s more than okay He showed us
something He did something with
his hands -

BOY 2

You have to come see

Completely puzzled Ryan and Helen follow the kids

INT COMMON ROOM - FIRST LEVEL - MOMENTS LATER

Simon now lies unconscious by the fire surrounded by more
than a dozen of the younger boys They’re looking at him in
amazement as other kids keep trickling inside

Ryan and Helen enter the room and push their way through
towards Simon They reach his side and lean over him His
eyes are fluttering rapidly beneath closed eyelids again
Ryan pulls the blanket back over him

RYAN
What happened

Some of the boys look shell-shocked

BOY 2
He

Suddenly shy the kid doesn’t finish

HELEN
He what
ERIC
(unable to contain his
excitement)
It was a miracle Simon performed a
miracle

That breaks the silence and all the boys start babbling at
once

VARIOUS BOYS
He made a glowing ball of light -
It was holy magic Like the priests
talk about

HELEN
None of you are making sense

The boys keep chattering away Ryan stands up

RYAN
(cutting through the
noise)
Look I don’t know what happened
but you need to leave Simon alone
and let him rest okay

The boys quiet down but don’t move away

RYAN (CONTD)
Come on back off

Reluctantly the boys move away from Simon But they don’t go
far They hang around the room whispering to each other
their eyes never leaving Simon’s face

Helen frowns at Ryan as they sit down next to Simon
HELEN
(low voice)
I think everyone’s going stir
crazy

EXT BRIARCLIFF REFORM SCHOOL - NIGHT

The HOWLINGWHISTLING sound wails in the distance

INT STORAGE CLOSET - NIGHT

Jay beats his fists against the door furious His face is
red and swollen like he’s been crying

JAY
(hoarse voice)
Open the door

No response Defeated Jay sinks down against the door
huddles up into a ball exhausted

INT FATHER CLEARY’S QUARTERS - SIMULTANEOUS

Ike is slumped at the large desk passed out An empty bottle
of Scotch next to him Sammy is stretched out on the couch
dead asleep and snoring

Ben sits amongst the wreckage on the floor He just stares
out the window at the mountain while the HOWLINGWHISTLING
continues

INT THE DORMITORY ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

Ryan stands by the immense picture window also looking at
the imposing mountain listening to the wind’s eerie sound

HELEN (0OS)
Ryan

Ryan turns as Helen joins him at the window

HELEN (CONTD)
You need to get some rest too

RYAN
How’s Simon

HELEN
The same as before

Ryan looks back up at the mountain

RYAN
(softly)
There’s something I need to tell
you I found Father O’Brien up
there Frozen to death in the
snow
HELEN
(shocked)
What Why didn’t you tell me
already
RYAN

I didn’t want to scare you Or
anyone else It’s like Father
O’Brien was trying to get to the
crevice just like Simon

Helen swallows Tries to recover

HELEN
But why What for

RYAN
I don’t know The crevice It
messes with your mind I thought I
heard my girlfriends voice I

thought I saw things

HELEN

(hopefully)
Maybe it was the wind and cold

playing tricks

Ryan keeps his eyes on the mountain as the HOWLINGWHISTLING
continues Helen still looks horrified about Father O’Brien’s
death

RYAN
Let’s head back downstairs

INT COMMON ROOM - FIRST LEVEL - MORNING
Ryan lays sleeping beneath a blanket on the stage He wakes

up to the sound of MOVEMENT and WHISPERING He sits up looks
over and is surprised to see -

Simon standing by the dying fire a blanket around him
surrounded by a half dozen of the younger boys They’re
looking at him with reverence

RYAN
Simon

As Ryan stands up we see that many of the boys camped out in
the common room overnight Others are now waking up and
joining the small crowd around Simon

As Ryan moves over to Simon Helen gets up from his own
makeshift bed of blankets and pillows He puts his hearing
aid in follows Ryan

Simon regards Ryan coolly

RYAN (CONTD)
(smiling)
I’m glad to see you standing up
How do you feel

SIMON
I feel Perfect

Helen starts checking him over He suddenly realizes

HELEN
(startled)
Your frostbite It’s all better

Indeed the black splotches on Simon’s face have vanished

RYAN
What happened up there Simon

SIMON
I don’t remember One second I was
here at Briarcliff The next I was
at the crevice

The kids are hanging on his every word More boys keep
joining them attracted by the conversation

YOUNG KID
(shyly to Simon)
That thing you did last night with
your hand Can you do it again

Simon looks over at him Doesn’t respond

Helen looks nervously at Ryan Simon is unquestionably
different now

HELEN
Your frostbite Simon I don’t
understand

Simon just looks at Helen with that same detached gaze

BOY 2
(softly)
We told you It was a miracle

Simon smiles as some of the other boys nod in agreement

Ryan and Helen look at each other Not sure what to make of
all this weirdness Simon’s eyes start to get a glazed look
again and he starts talking slowly

SIMON
Something happened to Jay didn’t
it There was a fight yesterday

Jays locked away He’s very
angry right now And very
scared

Helen glances at Ryan

HELEN
(whispers)
How can he know this

RYAN
One of the kids must have told him

Simon keeps talking in his trance-like voice

SIMON
But Jay is a sinner And sinners
must answer for their sins
Sinners must always be cleansed

ANOTHER YOUNG KID
Yeah I hate Jay

Simon’s voice takes on a darker sinister quality It’s like
he’s channeling someone - or something - else He raises his
dark eyes to stare balefully at Ryan and Helen

SIMON
The voice in the crevice It told
me We must cleanse Jays sins

Many of the kids start nodding in agreement either
transfixed by Simon’s oddly messianic attitude or just
excited by the idea of getting some sort of revenge against
Jay Ryan looks concerned Some kids dart out of the room
running off to tell others

HELEN
(whispers to Ryan)
Simon’s lost his marbles

Simon starts to move forward slowly

SIMON
Bring me to Isaiah and Samuel

Several of the younger kids rush forward leading Simon out
of the room to find Ike and Sammy Concerned Ryan and Helen
follow

INT STAIRWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Simon and the younger boys are heading up the stairs Ryan
and Helen move up behind them

RYAN
Simon wait

Simon stops He turns and looks down at Ryan

RYAN (CONTD)
Emily will kill me if I don’t take
good care of you You’re probabl
dehydrated And you’re not thinking
straight -

SIMON
I’m thinking straight for the first
time in my life
Simon and his entourage start to move up the stairs again

RYAN
Simon

Simon pauses

SIMON
Don’t become a nuisance Ryan

Ryan is taken aback both by Simon’s words and his tone
RYAN
Then don’t act like an ungrateful
little brat I saved your life -

Simon just turns away from Ryan again and sweeps up the
stairs the other boys moving along in his wake

INT FATHER CLEARY’S QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

Sammy wakes up on the couch He sees Simon standing in the
middle of the room staring at him Ike is just getting up
from the desk where he’s been sleeping

Sammy stands groggy He meets Simon’s icy gaze

SAMMY
What do you want fuckface

The younger boys crowd in the hallway peering into the
room

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Ryan is cooking an omelet on the giant gas stove A few other
boys are scattered throughout the desolate kitchen looking
for food Helen moves over holding a half-open bag of
shredded cheese

HELEN
Found some cheddar

Ryan takes it Then hears a sudden COMMOTION out in the
cafeteria Eric appears in the kitchen doorway

ERIC
Simon’s called a meeting The
chapel in one hour

Excited Eric turns and hurries away to spread the news

EXT COURTYARD - DAY

A path has been made through the snow leading to the chapel
The old roof is weighted down with heavy snow Icicles
glisten from the eaves

A few boys dash quickly and silently into the chapel

INT CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS

Candles burn everywhere casting flickering shadows across
the dark spooky space All of the kids at Briarcliff have
gathered here They sit clustered in the darkness of the
pews drinking bottles of wine and chattering excitedly

Ryan and Helen sit in the audience near the front talking
quietly and earnestly

The crowd suddenly starts making noise Some kids start
standing up Ike and Sammy lead Jay into the room His wrists
are bound with twine and he stumbles as he walks because his
legs have been shackled with an old bicycle chain His face
is a swollen mess A few steps behind them comes Simon his
eyes burning with an intense gaze

JAY
(upon seeing the crowd)
What the hell is this

Ike and Sammy ignore Jay and lead him up to the front where
the ancient oak pulpit sits in front of the baptismal tank
Ike addresses the crowd

IKE
Simon showed me something

He pauses getting emotional MURMURS of excitement start
rippling through the crowd but Ike shouts over them

IKE (CONTD)
I don’t know how he did it I
don’t know But it was her

Tears inexplicably start streaming down his face Some of the
younger kids seem about to cry too Simon stands there blank-
faced

HELEN
(to Ryan)
What is he talking about

Sammy pulls a filthy T-shirt out of his pocket and wraps it
around Jays face like a blindfold

IKE
If we do what Simon tells us we
can get out here Get free of the
snow Simon knows things that we
don’t He can see things we can’t
He showed me his power -

The crowd is going nuts Some people are HECKLING Ike But
the younger kids start mobbing the stage trying to get close
to Simon Jay YELLS and CURSES through the dirty T-shirt as
he struggles against Sammy

Ryan stands up unable to take the lunacy anymore He starts
pushing his way forward

RYAN
Stop

IKE
We must cleanse Jay Teach him a
lesson

Ryan reaches the pulpit and leaps up onto the raised dais
that it stands on

RYAN
We have to stay rational if we want
to get through this
(to Ike)
Youre just making everyone go nuts
for no reason

Simon reaches over and puts a pale hand on Ryan’s arm

SIMON
Ryan Don’t get in the way We
have to do this I don’t know
how or why but it’s in my head
Like an instruction We must punish
Jay It’s why the grown-ups
disappeared It’s all connected
somehow And soon everything will
become clear

He turns to Sammy

SIMON (CONTD)
It’s time now

The kids don’t understand what’s going to happen at first
Sammy and Ike move around on either side of Jay and start
dragging him up a flight of steps towards the baptismal

tank

The kids realize at once that Jay is going to be tossed into
the water Ben SHRIEKS and throws a wine bottle onto the
stage where it shatters Simon doesn’t even flinch Other
boys start throwing stuff too

Jay goes nuts tries to attack Ike and Sammy But they
wrestle him to the top of the stairs The crowd is SCREAMING
Ryan looks across the dark chapel at Helen helplessly
Neither of them know what to do and there’s no way for them
to control this unruly mob

JAY
No Stop Fuck

As the crowd roars its brutal approval Simon nods at Ike and
Sammy Without hesitation they shove the blindfolded
shackled Jay into the water tank He yells and thrashes

Then to the surprise of the onlookers Ike and Sammy jump in
the water after him Simon moves to the pulpit

SIMON
Cleanse his sins Cleanse his
sins Cleanse his sins

The other kids pick up on his chant They begin to scream the
words like they’re calling for blood

KIDS
Cleanse his sins Cleanse his sins

Jay struggles to stay afloat in the tank For a moment it
looks like Ike and Sammy are going to help him But then
they shove his head underwater

Ryan rushes toward the tank but his path gets blocked by a
mob of other kids Almost as one the crowd has risen and is
running toward the tank But not to help Jay

Instead they are WHOOPING gleefully Several kids reach the
tank and start trying to punch Jay’s head anytime he
surfaces Others lean down to help Ike and Sammy The kids
continue chanting

KIDS (CONTD)
CLEANSE HIS SINS CLEANSE HIS
SINS CLEANSE HIS SINS

Jay fights and flails in the water unable to get a breath

Ryan tears through the crowd shoving and punching Simon
stands motionless at the podium Watching the boys with that
eerie detached gaze

Ryan finally reaches the top of the tank brutally shoving
another kid off and down to the floor But he’s too late
Jays body is just floating there

Even though he knows that the other kids might never let him

out Ryan leaps into the tank He grabs hold of Jay’s arm and
pulls him to the surface The other kids back off Jay isn’t

breathing

RYAN
(screaming)
He’s dead

The noise of the crowd dies down Ryan hauls Jay’s body out
of the tank and onto the floor of the chapel

Desperate Ryan starts performing CPR Pumping Jay’s chest
Breathing into his mouth

Helen makes his way to the front of the boys distraught Ike
and Sammy hover nearby their faces shell-shocked Ben is
grinning disturbingly Simon just stands by the pulpit
gazing up curiously at the statue of Christ on the cross

Ryan keeps pumping away on Jay’s chest It’s doing no good
At last he stops sits heavily next to the body He looks
around at all the boys

RYAN (CONTD)
Youve killed him

Simon turns his cold gaze on Ryan

RYAN (CONTD)
(to Simon)
Are you happy

Ryan stands up violently gets in Simon’s face

RYAN (CONTD)
Is this what you wanted

Simon actually seems to consider the question for a moment

SIMON
It’s what you wanted Ryan You
punched him in the face You
hated Jay So did everyone else
here

Ryan is dumbfounded

RYAN
What No I didn’t want him to die
You’ve gone crazy -—

Simon looks around at the boys

SIMON
Jay told everybody that he burned
down his school But that was a
lie Do you know the real reason
he was sent here to Briarcliff

The crowd hangs on his every word

SIMON (CONTD)
He stole a stop sign A pregnant
woman drove through the
intersection and got hit by a
pickup She lost her baby -

RYAN
(interrupting)
You don’t know that
Ike steps forward Stares crazily at Ryan

IKE
Yes he does

The crowd murmurs its assent

IKE (CONTD)
He showed me my mother She died
when I was five but Simon showed
her to me like when she was
alive

YOUNG KID
He made fire with his hands

Ryan stares at the boys as they work themselves up again
He’s convinced they’ve all gone insane

VARIOUS BOYS
Fire We all saw it Simon can do
miracles

RYAN
What’s wrong with you

The boys suddenly hush looking at something behind Ryan
Ryan turns to see -

Simon is levitating several feet off the ground His eyes are
closed

Ryan watches in shock as boys drop to their knees all around
him Helen is stunned too and can’t believe his eyes

Simon rises farther into the air as the hymn books and wine
bottles in the pews suddenly start to shake and rattle He
reaches a height of about fifteen feet directly in front of
the statue of Jesus Christ

Hymn books and wine bottles and other debris rise into the
air and are pulled toward Simon creating a swirling
maelstrom around him

Ryan stumbles away in shock He backs slowly down the aisle
unable to look away from Simon

Simon opens his eyes He slowly raises his arms out to the
sides mirroring the statue of Christ

Helen moves toward Ryan while the other boys stare up at
Simon cowering around the stage in fear and devotion

Ryan can’t take anymore He turns and flees the chapel Helen
right behind him
INT SMALL CLASSROOM - NIGHT

Ryan sits on a desk toward the back of the room staring out
a big window into the darkness

The large teacher’s desk has been pushed in front of the
door like a barricade Helen leans over it peering out a
thin window in the door into the hall

HELEN
You think they’re going to come
after us We’ve been in here all
day

Ryan doesn’t respond just stares out the window
HELEN (CONTD)
This desk won’t hold them back you
know
Helen moves over to the window peers out at the snowy night
HELEN (CONTD)
It was a trick wasn’t it It had
to be
Ryan still doesn’t respond

HELEN (CONTD)
Ryan Say something Please

Ryan looks grimly at Helen

RYAN
It wasn’t a trick Helen

HELEN
It had to have been Otherwise
it’s it’s impossible It defies
all logic

RYAN
We both saw it

HELEN
I just I

Helen sits heavily

HELEN (CONTD)
I guess I don’t understand

This is a phrase that Helen obviously does not like to say

RYAN
I don’t either but something
happened to Simon up there It’s

like something from the crevice got
inside him Possessed him I don’t
know what it wants but I doubt
it’s anything good

As if responding to Ryan the HOWLINGWHISTLING from the
crevice begins to resound in the distance

RYAN (CONTD)
(shaking his head)
God that noise I can’t think
straight when it’s howling -

Ryan stops talking as something suddenly occurs to him

RYAN (CONTD)
You know the story of the Pied
Piper

HELEN
Of course He hypnotized all these
rats and children in Germany by
playing a tune on his pipe Then
he led them to a river where they
drowned

Helen trails off his eyes on that looming mountain as the
HOWLINGWHISTLING continues

HELEN (CONTD)
You think that’s what happened to
Father O’Brien and the other
grownups That the sound of the
crevice lured them to their deaths

Helen looks at Ryan with big scared eyes Ryan looks from
Helen back up to the mountain He doesn’t answer

Helen takes his hearing aid out Puts his face in his hands

EXT BRIARCLIFF REFORM SCHOOL - NIGHT

The horrible HOWLINGWHISTLING fills the night

INT SMALL CLASSROOM - MORNING

Ryan wakes up on the floor He sits up sore and
uncomfortable and listens to the sound of FOOTSTEPS in the
hallway Helen sits at a desk leaning over it sound asleep

Ryan creeps to the door Peers out the window He catches a
glimpse of Eric moving down the hall Ryan pulls the desk
away and opens the door a crack

RYAN
(softly)
Eric

Eric jumps and turns around He sees Ryan and trots over

ERIC
What are you doing in there

RYAN
Come on in

Eric looks down the hall hesitates

RYAN (CONTD)
Just for a minute

Eric comes into the room and Ryan closes the door Helen sits
up rubbing his sore neck

HELEN
Owww

He stands up puts his hearing aid in and blinks at Eric

ERIC
Hi Helen
RYAN
What’s been going on out there
ERIC
Oh man did you miss a lot Simon
can can he can pretty much do
anything It’s like he’s not even

human

Ryan and Helen exchange looks Eric’s words don’t exactly put
their minds at ease

RYAN
Where is everyone else

ERIC
Some of us are eating others are
in the chapel already Simons
started hearing confessions

HELEN
Confessions

ERIC
Yeah but it’s not like normal
confession I haven’t had my turn
yet They say it’s amazing That
you feel different afterward Why
don’t you guys come down

RYAN
(hedging)
Maybe later Eric

ERIC
Well I gotta go I don’t wanna
miss my turn

Eric jogs out of the room

Ryan looks out the window at the brick garage visible below
Snow still covers everything but it’s a clear day The sun
is shining

INT EXT GARAGE - BACK OF THE SCHOOL - DAY

Ryan stands by one of the snowmobiles slipping into a big
jacket Helen stands nearby tugging at his hearing aid

HELEN
I don’t know Ryan If there’s
something in the crevice and it
affected Simon like this shouldn’t
we stay away from it

RYAN
You don’t have to come

Ryan starts pushing the snowmobile out of the garage

HELEN
I don’t want to stay here by
myself

RYAN

Then grab a jacket
As Ryan gets the snowmobile out of the garage Helen looks at
the closet conflicted Finally he stomps over grabs a
jacket for himself
EXT WILDERNESS - DAY
Ryan navigates the snowmobile across the miniature-valley
Helen riding behind him holding onto Ryan’s waist The
brilliant snow glitters like a meadow of tiny white diamonds
in the morning sun
ANOTHER ANGLE - LATER
Ryan drives the snowmobile slowly through the rocky section
of land that leads up to the caves
EXT CAVES - A BIT LATER

Ryan and Helen leave the snowmobile behind and pause at the
mouth of the cave There is no wind

No sound comes from the crevice within But in its own way
the silence is just as eerie as the devilish howl

Helen looks terrified Ryan glances at him

RYAN
You can wait out here if you want

HELEN
(shakes his head)
I’m sticking with you

RYAN
Whatever you do just don’t look
directly into the crevice I think
we can haul a few of the big rocks
into it Block it off

HELEN
And then

RYAN
Then I don’t know We see what
happens

HELEN
That’s your big plan

Ryan looks at Helen realizing how flimsy it sounds

RYAN
Weve got to try something

Ryan moves into the cave Helen follows right behind

INTEXT CAVES - CONTINUOUS

They move slowly through the darkness the faint light ahead
of them Helen’s eyes dart all over the place He’s dismayed
to see the openings to the various tunnels that break off
from the main cave

HELEN
(whispering)
You didn’t tell me about all these
tunnels

They make it to the first bend Peer around the corner and
see more empty cave in front of them They keep moving

They are nearing the final bend when there’s a sudden
SCURRYING sound from one of the tunnel openings They freeze
Helen grabbing onto Ryan’s arm as tightly as he can They try
to peer into the tunnel directly across from them but see
nothing but blackness

There’s another sound of MOVEMENT from the darkness followed
by a blood-chilling HIGH PITCHED GIGGLING

The boys can’t move They suddenly look impossibly young two
children with the abrupt cold certainty that they are about
to come face to face with the Bogeyman with the thing
underneath the bed maybe with death itself

HELEN (CONTD)
(tiny voice)
Ryan

A TERRIFYING MAD WOMAN charges out of the darkness -

Helen SHRIEKS

The deranged woman is on them in an instant clawing and
scratching Ryan loses his footing and falls to the ground
Helen scurries away around the next bend The woman starts
babbling a mile a minute

MAD WOMAN
I knew it I knew you’d come He
told me you would he told me he
showed me everything and now it
must be my turn it must be my time
to fall

Ryan peers up into the frostbitten face of the raving woman
She’s filthy wearing tattered rags and her hair is a chaotic
bird’s nest and then Ryan recognizes her Helen speaks
before he can say anything

HELEN (0S)
(totally horrified)
Sister Fiona

Helen is peering out from around the bend And we see that it
is indeed Sister Fiona Her grimy rags are the remains of her
habit It looks like she’s stark naked beneath them

Sister Fiona looks over at Helen She rushes toward him as he
flees around the bend terrified Ryan scrambles up and
follows

INT EXT THE CREVICE - CONTINUOUS

Helen comes to a sudden halt when he sees the crevice ahead
He’s not close enough to look down into it yet A light
breeze is coming into the cave from the cliff-face The
crevice WHISTLES softly seductively Sister Fiona grabs at
Helen from behind

SISTER FIONA
You can do it to me first before
we fall You can give it to me good
right here and now I know you want
it

Helen spins around pushes her away She falls to her knees
before him as Ryan joins them

Sister Fiona claws at Helen’s pants trying to pull them
down She’s raving hysterically

SISTER FIONA (CONTD)
Youre a virgin I can tell but
that’s okay you can stick me and
you won’t be a virgin anymore

Helen struggles against her terrified but strangely aroused
She may be dirty and insane but in a sick way she’s still
disturbingly sexy Her eyes dart around the cave until they
light upon something wet and shiny She grabs a broken icicle
off the ground

SISTER FIONA (CONT’D)
Use this That’s it An icicle I
deserve it -

Ryan grabs her
RYAN
Sister Fiona stop What’s
wrong What’s happened to you

She turns her fevered gaze onto Ryan

SISTER FIONA
(slowing down)

I’m not a virgin I think that’s
why he hasn’t let me fall yet He
let the others fall Sister

Stella and Sister Imogen they were
pure do you understand not like
me I’m the only one left HE
LET THEM FALL

RYAN
Something horrible happened to you
Sister I think -

Sister Fiona reaches for Ryan’s crotch With sudden clarity
as if receiving a transmission she says

SISTER FIONA
I know you want to fuck me

Ryan steps back -

FLASH CUT TO

EXT BEACH - FLORIDA - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Emilys beautiful face emerges from the darkness
EMILY
I know you want to fuck me
INT EXT THE CREVICE - BACK TO THE PRESENT

Overwhelmed by deja vu Ryan stares at Sister Fiona

SIMON (0S)
(calmly)
Take her if you like She’s

nothing

Startled Ryan and Helen look over to see Simon standing in
the cave Ike and Sammy stand at attention behind him

When Sister Fiona sees Simon she starts weeping

Simon steps forward followed by Ike and Sammy Sister Fiona
crawls to Simon starts kissing his feet but he completely
ignores her His eyes are glued to the crevice

RYAN
What is that thing Simon And what
has it done to you

Simon just grins The inside of his mouth is black from
blood Helen suddenly tries to bolt toward a nearby tunnel
opening Sammy races forward and grabs him at once Ryan
moves toward them

RYAN (CONTD)
Hey -

Sammy tosses Helen roughly to the ground The kid lands hard
a couple feet in front of the crevice As he pushes himself
up he glances down into it And instantly freezes

RYAN (CONTD)
Helen

Ryan tries to move to him but Ike and Sammy quickly grab
him Ryan struggles against them They hold him tight deadly
strong and serious now

Sister Fiona is sobbing in a frenzy grabbing at Simon’s
shins

SISTER FIONA
Please Father let me go now
I’ve waited and I’ve waited and
I’ve prayed and prayed Please let
me fall

Simon looks down at her with disdain He gives a dismissive
wave of his hand

SIMON
Go

Sister Fiona smiles up at him with a heartbreaking sense of
Joy

SISTER FIONA
Thank you

She stumbles to her feet rushes toward the crevice with a
euphoric look on her face Helen is still on his knees
mesmerized by whatever visions he sees in the crevice He’s
right in Sister Fiona’s path

RYAN
No Helen

Ryan struggles against Ike and Sammy He watches helpless
as -

Sister Fiona collides into Helen knocking his hearing aid
out and tumbling him partway into the abyss

Helen instantly snaps out of his trance He reaches out
grabs onto the edge of the crevice both legs dangling down
into it He tries to haul himself back up clawing at the icy
rock

Sister Fiona pauses for an instant right at the edge staring
down into the crevice those strange lights playing off her
face

HELENS POV Ryan still held by Ike and Sammy SCREAMS
something but it’s DISTORTED and MUFFLED as is THE
HOWLINGWHISTLING

Helen starts to panic as his grip on the rock begins to slip
his weight dragging him down

Ryan is still SCREAMING

A sense of peace seems to wash over Sister Fiona as she
stares into the abyss She brings her hands together as if
in prayer Then she closes her eyes and lets herself fall
forward

Helen is directly in her path He realizes what’s going to
happen to him His anguished eyes find Ryan’s

Sister Fiona’s body hits Helen as she falls and the two of
them tumble down into the crevice

RYAN (CONTD)
NO

Helen’s silly pink hearing aid sits on the lip of the
crevice It’s the only thing left of him

Ike and Sammy hurl Ryan to the floor of the cave His head
connects with solid rock and we CUT TO BLACK

OVER BLACK
EMILY (V0O)
(in pain)

Ryan

FLASH CUT TO

EXT DREAM SEA - DAY

Under a sickly red sun Emily flails in a squirming writhing
sea of BLACK SNAKES Its an impossibly vast tableau a
vision of an infinite Hell Emily panics as the Serpents
start pulling her under She fights for breath

EMILY
RYAN PLEASE RYAN -

SMASH CUT TO

INT EMILY’S ROOM - NIGHT

Emily is on top of Ryan on her bed kissing him She pulls
back gazes down at him seriously

EMILY
I’m doing this because I love you
Ryan

Ryan blinks up at her in confusion She wears her white
bikini The white curtains billow behind her

Everything is exactly the same as it was the night that Ryan
beat up Emily’s father

Emily starts kissing Ryan again He goes with it not knowing
what’s real and what’s not anymore Just relishing the feel
of his girl

Their hands are all over each other and things are
progressing faster and faster And Ryan’s hands are unhooking
her top and -

The door swings opens Emily and Ryan look over as Ryan
starts to panic -

But no one’s there Emily grins down at Ryan

EMILY (CONTD)
Just the wind I guess

Ryan laughs Tries to calm himself down Maybe everything
really is going to be okay

Emily’s unhooked bikini top hangs tantalizingly from her
breasts Ryan slowly reaches for it

As he touches her Emily’s appearance suddenly shimmers
bizarrely

RYAN
Emily

Emilys head starts to disintegrate into tiny particles as
if she’s a girl made out of sand The disturbing process
quickly works its way downward and her entire body crumbles
to dust onto the terrified Ryan as he SCREAMS -

INT CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - NIGHT

Ryan suddenly jerks awake SCREAMING in the confined dark
space He looks around disoriented He tries to move and

realizes that his hands are tied behind his back His feet
are bound together as well

The small shutter on the wall is pushed open illuminating
the booth with faint light Simon’s profile appears through
the screen

RYAN
(gasping)
Simon - Stop this Why are -
SIMON
Because I’ve always had visions
And heard voices Ever since I

can remember But the crevice
turned up the volume

RYAN
(struggling both to speak
and get free of the rope)
Youre not yourself Listen you
need -

SIMON
I used to draw and paint the
visions that I saw But now I
realize I can bring them to
life

A brilliant scarlet light gradually illuminates the booth
Ryan strains at the ropes holding him down in vain

Simon raises his hand and Ryan sees that a glowing red ball

of light is emanating from the boy’s bloody palm The light
makes Simon’s face glow demonically

SIMON (CONTD)
The One inside the crevice was
waiting for someone with my gifts

all along All these years To
do its bidding
(beat)

I am the perfect vessel
Ryan watches as the ball starts to fade away

SIMON (CONTD)
It is older than you can imagine
Some called it Demon Some called
it God It’s inside me now And
it’s ready to leave this useless
wasteland We have plans

Simon turns his cold gaze onto Ryan
SIMON (CONTD)
I will not ask you to confess to
me

RYAN
Simon -

The door to the booth is pulled open

Ike and Sammy peer in at Ryan Their faces are painted red
They hold knives They grab Ryan

INT CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS

Ike and Sammy yank Ryan out of the booth They sit him down
on a wooden chair on the dais It’s dark and candles burn all
around him

The room is filled with boys Many cry and moan flinging
themselves to the floor in religious ecstasy Ike and Sammy
kneel on either side of Ryan brandishing their knives

Ryan stares out at all the boys in terror He keeps trying to
squirm his way out of his bonds

Simon stands before the crowd soaking in their adulations
His skin is as pale as a sheet of paper Like a corpse He
turns to gaze at Ryan

Ryan glares up at him with angry sad eyes

RYAN
Helen died because of you And
Sister Fiona and Jay You’re
sick This isn’t you Simon
You’re not evil

Simon glides over to him as if his feet aren’t even touching
the floor The noise of the crowd gets louder

SIMON
Good and evil are pointless The
priests here they crumbled before
me They heard my siren call in
their slumber and they leapt to
their deaths in the crevice
Powerless

He looks out at the crowd

SIMON (CONT’D)
These children have confessed to
me and now I control their minds
(beat)
I am the start of a revolution
Ryan Of a new world order I am
the Black Angel

Simon glides back into the darkness The crowd grows even
louder Ike and Sammy stand up their knives out

Ryan struggles knowing that something awful is about to
happen to him but Sammy pins him down in the chair Ike
grips the back of the chair his eyes empty

RYAN
Fuck - No - STOP

Ike raises the knife It glistens in the candlelight The
crowd begins SHRIEKING and WAILING in devotion

The knife slashes down Ryan flinches sideways trying to
avoid the savage attack

But a split second later he realizes that Ike is just
slashing the ropes It takes Ryan another second to realize
that he’s been freed He staggers up untangling himself from
the coils

Ryan gazes out at the crowd They have abruptly fallen
silent They stare at him like hypnotized brainwashed
zombies He spins around and sees Ike and Sammy advancing on
him with their knives

SAMMY
Simon has asked for a blood
sacrifice To prove our devotion
and love for him

IKE
Like Abraham in the Bible -

SAMMY
You will be our sacrificial lamb -

Ryan looks at them in confused horror

IKE
But unlike the God of our parents
Simon is fair You get a head
start But then we come for you
And then we get you

A WHISPERING HISSING VOICE suddenly blares at Ryan from all
directions It’s Simon He’s floating out of the blackness
above the heads of the crowd Tears of blood drip from his
eyes Blood also drips from his mouth and from his
fingertips

He raises a hand and paints an upsidedown cross in the air
out of his blood Somehow it hangs there in the air above his
audience Holding everyone mesmerized

SIMON
The first one to find Ryan and
carve out his heart will win my
eternal favor

The cross of blood collapses spattering down on the upturned
faces of the crowd The crowd goes crazy with delight
ROARING and SCREAMING Ryan’s face is white with terror

Sammy raises his knife and bares his teeth

SAMMY
(savage glee)
So run little lamb run

Simon watches coolly blood still dripping from the corners
of his mouth Ryan staggers out of the chapel and into the
depths of the school

INT CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Ryan races down the hall trying to get away from the crowd
He can hear their FERAL NOISES in the chapel behind him

INT STAIRWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Ryan races up a flight of stairs nearly falling careening
out of control Desperately trying to think of a place to
hide

INT THE LANDING - CONTINUOUS

Ryan suddenly grabs the railing and comes to a halt Out the
window he’s seen something the garage Where the snowmobiles
wait

EXT COURTYARD - SIMULTANEOUS

Kids have started pouring out of the chapel in a frenzy for
bloodshed Any pretense at civilized behavior has collapsed
The kids are in the throes of their deranged worship for
Simon Nothing is going to stop them from finding and killing
Ryan

INT EXT BACK OF THE SCHOOL - SIMULTANEOUS

Ryan pushes open the door The garage is directly ahead Ryan
steps toward it when -

Ben suddenly appears from around the corner The gash on his
forehead flows with fresh blood He looks completely
psychotic as he rears up an axe and moves toward Ryan

BEN
No cheating

Ryan staggers back and slams the door as Ben swings the
axe The axe head plunges into the door

Ryan turns and flees while Ben pulls the axe free

INT CAFETERIA - SIMULTANEOUS

Roving bands of kids with weapons race through the cafeteria
SCREAMING for Ryan

INT THE DORMITORY - SIMULTANEOUS

Kids flood the room tossing over bunk beds SCREAMING Ryan’s
name over and over

INT COMMON ROOM - FIRST LEVEL - SIMULTANEOUS

More mobs of kids roam the common area hunting

INT THE CHAPEL - SIMULTANEOUS

The chapel is now empty We hear the SHOUTS and YELLS of the
departed throng in the distance as they hunt

Only Simon remains hanging upside down in the air His eyes

are shut and his lips move rapidly As though he’s receiving

another transmission Blood steadily pours from his eyes his
ears his nose We follow the blood down to the floor

When it hits the ancient wood it sizzles and smokes The
smoke rises turning into flames Within seconds the flames
sweep across the pews

Simon hangs in the air unharmed As we MOVE IN closer to his
face his eyes suddenly snap open and we CUT TO

INT STAIRWAY - SIMULTANEOUS

Ryan creeps up the stairs trying to be quiet while the
sounds of PANDEMONIUM reign below As he reaches the second
level Eric appears at the bottom of the stairs Ryan
freezes gazes down at Eric

RYAN
(whispering
Don’t say anything Eric
please

Eric regards him for a moment with a quizzical expression
Then he suddenly SCREAMS

ERIC
I FOUND HIM HES ON THE STAIRS

Ryan flees upstairs as boys begin to race toward them Eric
charges up after him quickly followed by a mass of crazed
boys

INT BRIARCLIFF - UPPER LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

Ryan makes it to the top level where the priests’ rooms are
He sprints down the corridor

Boys pursue him wildly Ike and Sammy toward the front
looking completely insane with their painted faces

Ryan rounds a corner At the end of the corridor seemingly a
mile away stands the door to Father Cleary’s quarters Ryan
races for it

The mass of boys come flying around the corner right behind
him They’re SCREAMING hellbent on tearing him limb from
limb And Ryan’s SCREAMING too as he sprints as fast as he
can

The boys are almost upon him when Ryan makes it to Father
Cleary’s door He flings it open and slams the door shut
behind him

INT FATHER CLEARY’S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

Ryan throws the lock as the mass of boys hit the other side
of the door hard enough to make it buckle They immediately
start POUNDING on the door and throwing themselves against

it

Ryan looks around the trashed room He moves to Father
Cleary’s big oak desk tries to push it over toward the door
It doesn’t budge

Ryan redoubles his efforts as CHAOS echoes out in the
hallway He strains against the desk It starts sliding
slowly over to the door

INT EXT BACK OF THE SCHOOL - SIMULTANEOUS
Simon walks purposefully toward the back door

As he moves fire spontaneously spreads out behind him as if

created by his very being It quickly engulfs everything

He opens the door and Ben stands there waiting for him still
holding the axe Ben looks at Simon reverently Simon is
framed in the doorway while the hungry flames behind him
consume the room

Ben smiles crazily the firelight reflected in his eyes

BEN
Master

Simon brushes past him moving through the snow toward the
garage Ben follows

INT FATHER CLEARY’S QUARTERS - SIMULTANEOUS

Ryan gets the heavy desk in front of the door just as the
lock breaks The door starts to open but Ryan throws himself
against the desk slamming the door shut again

He looks desperately around the room The boys push against
him from the other side of the door

Ryan moves to the bookcase tears it free from the wall and
shoves it forward The bookcase collapses onto the desk
anchoring it down against the onslaught from outside It
holds At least for now

Then something outside the window catches Ryan’s attention
From up here he can see Simon and Ben getting onto the
snowmobile in the garage

INTEXT GARAGE - BACK OF THE SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

Simon guns the snowmobile out of the garage Ben sits behind
him holding onto his waist with one hand With his other
hand he raises the axe into the air in triumph

As Simon starts to drive away flames suddenly appear on the
walls of the garage licking their way up to the roof

INT FATHER CLEARY’S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

Panicked Ryan watches Simon and Ben drive off down the
mountain Out in the hallway the boys are battering on the
door more frantically than ever Ryan turns around to scream
at them

RYAN
Simon’s abandoning you He doesn’t
care about any of us don’t you get
1t HES GONE

The desk and bookcase are suddenly knocked back several
inches Hands and arms of the boys in the hallway appear in
the crack of the doorway trying to fight their way inside

Ryan finds the latch on the window frees it and yanks the
window open Cold air gusts into the room

The door crashes open behind him as Ryan climbs outside

EXT BRIARCLIFF - ROOF - CONTINUOUS

Ryan immediately loses his footing on the icy roof He falls
starts sliding down the roof picking up speed at an alarming
rate The edge of the roof looms directly ahead of him

Ryan twists around grabs onto the gutter at the last second

His body swings off the roof But Ryan holds on tight
dangling there by one hand

Ryan grabs onto the gutter with his other hand A few feet in
front of him is a ledge that runs around the building beneath
the windows of the next level

Ryan tries to swing his feet over to the ledge They don’t
quite make it He tries again and this time his feet find the
ledge

A couple massive icicles break off from the gutter and
plummet to the ground like frozen missiles

Ryan reaches out and manages to get a grip on the brick wall
Still holding onto the gutter with his other hand Ryan tries
to pull himself closer to the wall using the brick as
leverage and -

The brick crumbles to dust in his fingers and Ryan loses his
grip tumbling backward through the air

Falling Falling

And then crash-landing in deep snow The impact stuns him
but he shakes it off relieved to still be alive He takes a
deep breath Then he sees -

A huge icicle on the gutter directly above him It breaks off
and falls straight down

Ryan twists out of the way just in time The icicle lands
deep in the snow like a spear right where his head was only
seconds ago Ryan staggers to his feet and backs away from
the building Then he turns and runs heading toward the
burning garage

INT BRIARCLIFF - UPPER LEVEL - SIMULTANEOUS

Eric stands in the corridor looking back toward the stairs
Thick black smoke billows up from the raging fire Behind
him the boys are tearing apart Father Cleary’s quarters
while others are climbing out onto the roof in pursuit of
Ryan A look of terror slowly dawns on Eric’s face

ERIC
Were trapped Were trapped

The boys behind him are too intent on destruction to notice
or care
INTEXT GARAGE - BACK OF THE SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

The garage burns around him while Ryan races to the second
snowmobile He jumps on it goes to turn it on and sees -

There’s no key

On the far wall the flames are quickly working their way to
the gasoline pump

Ryan looks around desperately He spots the keys hanging from
a nail across the room

Ryan rushes toward them ducking flames as he goes
Flames start to spread over the gas pump

Ryan grabs the keys then GASPS and drops them as they burn
his hand red-hot from the nearby flames

Ryan scrambles for the keys grabs them again ignoring the
pain this time He dashes back to the snowmobile slams the
keys home and turns the machine on with a satisfying ROAR

Ryan guns the snowmobile out of the garage just as the fire
fully consumes the gas pump

The garage EXPLODES behind Ryan

Flaming bricks rain down in the night air all around him

EXT BRIARCLIFF REFORM SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

Multiple fires rage in the school as Ryan speeds off down the
mountain heading into the barren snowy landscape

Boys are climbing out of the upper windows onto the roof to
escape the fire

INT THE CHAPEL - SIMULTANEOUS

The ancient structure is now a raging inferno Beams CREAK
and MOAN and then come crashing down in a barrage of sparks
EXT THE ROAD - WILDERNESS - MOMENTS LATER

Ryan races the vehicle down the snow covered mountain road
following the tracks of the other snowmobile

The occasional road sign peaking out of the top of the snow
is the only indication that there is indeed a road beneath
this massive blanket of powder

Above the moon is near the horizon and the sky is just
beginning to show signs of blue Dawn is close

Ryan makes a tight turn barely slowing down He drifts
dangerously close to the edge of a drop-off sending flurries
over the side

He powers the snowmobile on even faster determined to catch
up to Simon and Ben

Ryan rounds another bend and hauls ass down a long steep
stretch

Down the mountain he catches a glimpse of the other
snowmobile racing down the hill

ANOTHER ANGLE - DOWN THE MOUNTAIN - SIMULTANEOUS

Driving the snowmobile with Ben riding behind him Simon
looks back up the mountain and sees Ryan racing down after
them He grins

ANOTHER ANGLE - RESUME WITH RYAN

Ryan rounds another twist in the road Simon and Ben are

toward the bottom of another perilous stretch down the
mountain He races after them

EXT THE ROAD - WILDERNESS - MOMENTS LATER

Ryan finally manages to pull up alongside the other
snowmobile He looks desperately over at Simon who just
stares calmly back at him as they race along

RYAN
Simon Stop

Simon grins demonically

RYAN (CONTD)
Simon -

Ben suddenly jumps up behind Simon and swings the axe at
Ryan

Ryan swerves and ducks narrowing avoiding the whistling axe
blade

Simon swerves toward Ryan and Ben swings out again The axe
blade smashes into the front of Ryan’s snowmobile Ben rears
back for another blow and Ryan swerves off the road

EXT WILDERNESS - CONTINUOUS

Ryan whips around trees and boulders narrowly avoiding
crashing

Simon roars up alongside him again Ben fully standing behind
him now totally out of his mind brandishing the axe

Simon smashes the side of his snowmobile into Ryan’s Ben
nearly loses his balance but manages to hold on

He swings at Ryan again but Ryan swerves away around a tree
just in time

Simon darts around several pine trees with ease then careens
toward Ryan again Ben has the axe raised high meaning to
take Ryan’s head off

Ryan tries to dart ahead of them but Simon smashes into his
snowmobile again Ben wobbles but keeps his balance

Ryan tries to swerve away but the snowmobiles are stuck
together now

With a wild SCREAM Ben tries to swing the axe down but Ryan
grabs his forearms with both hands completely letting go of
the snowmobile controls

Ben falls onto Ryan and the two of them struggle as they all
race onward

Ben suddenly sees something ahead and starts CACKLING with
mad glee Ryan looks forward and sees -

The drop-off of a huge cliff looming ahead of them They’re
only moments away from plunging over the edge

Ben SCREAMS with a lunatic’s sense of joy Ryan tries to jump
off the snowmobile but Ben holds him tight Simon just
stares at Ryan with a calm smile

Ryan suddenly elbows Ben in the face and leaps from the
snowmobile Ben holds onto him and the two of them tumble
into the snow

Ryan scrambles to his knees in the powder his eyes on Simon
as the stuck-together snowmobiles fly out over the edge of
the cliff

RYAN
Simon

As the snowmobiles plummet to the depths below Simon’s body
leaves them floating impossibly into the air

Ben staggers to his feet watching crazily as Simon floats
serenely back down to the edge of the cliff and lands with
his feet on the icy rock

From somewhere far below we hear the SNOWMOBILES CRASH
VIOLENTLY INTO ROCKS And then sudden silence

Ryan is catching his breath his eyes on Simon when -

Ben suddenly swings the axe down at him

Ryan rolls out of the way as the axe plunges into the snow
He darts to his feet turns toward Ben as Ben charges him
again swinging the axe wildly

Simon watches with interest as Ryan dodges back avoiding the
blow Beyond Simon the sun rises over the vast wilderness

Ben rears back with the axe again rushes forward meaning to
go in for the kill This time Ryan rushes forward too and

meets him head on He throws up a hand to block the axe and
brutally punches Ben in the face

Ryan manages to knock the axe out of Ben’s hands and punches
him again And again

Ben falls to his knees blood flowing from his nose onto the
pristine white snow

And Ryan keeps attacking him his old familiar rage taking
over

Simon watches seemingly pleased as Ryan lets his fury
consume him Soon Ben falls back into the snow dazed and
horribly bloody

Ryan snatches up the axe and raises it ready to finish Ben
off

Ben stares up at him in sudden terror some semblance of
sanity creeping back into his eyes

And Ryan snaps out of his fury He starts to lower the axe

SIMON
Don’t be weak Ryan We both know
who you are deep inside Angry
Afraid Violent Like all humans

Ryan deliberately drops the axe into the snow making the
choice not to resort to more bloodshed He turns to face
Simon instead empty-handed

SIMON (CONTD)
You can’t deny your true nature
All those violent impulses you
can’t control I know you wanted
to kill Simon’s father that night
he attacked Emily -

RYAN
It’s over Simon Whatever it is
youre trying to do It’s
finished

Simon raises his arms as the new sun comes up behind him

SIMON
Youre wrong This is only the
beginning

Simon looks out across the frigid wilderness

SIMON (CONTD)
Somewhere beyond this nothingness
is a city And in that city there
are others who will confess to me
and then their minds will belong to
me My reign will be infinite

Ryan notices that Simon’s eyes have gone completely black

SIMON (CONTD)
I don’t need a snowmobile to get
there I will wear down this body
to the bone And then find more
hosts like Simon

Ryan slowly approaches Simon Ben just watches them from his
spot in the snow injured and confused

RYAN
Are you hearing any of this Simon
Is any part of you still left in
there

Simon just grins evilly at Ryan his black lizard eyes alert
and cunning Ryan perseveres

RYAN (CONTD)
Simon don’t let whatever came out
of that crevice destroy you Maybe
youve always been different than
everybody else but that’s not bad
it’s good And it doesn’t mean you
have to let this this stupid
thing steal your soul

Ryan’s words seem to be falling on deaf ears

SIMON
You creatures are so amusing

Ryan is now directly in front of Simon His hand slips into
his pocket

RYAN
Don’t do it for me

Ryan furtively pulls something out He shows it to Simon
It’s the photo of Emily

Simon’s brow furrows in confusion

RYAN (CONTD)
Do it for your sister Do it for
Emily

Simon blinks rapidly His eyes are no longer black It’s
like he’s shifting back and forth between himself and the
entity that possesses him

RYAN (CONTD)
She loves you Your dad tried to
throw out all your paintings but
she wouldn’t let him remember You
know why Because she cares about
you Do you hear what I’m
saying

Simon is shaking now An internal battle is being waged
within him

SIMON
(forcefully)
Nobody cares about Simon

Ryan is suddenly knocked backward by some invisible force He
lands on his back in the snow But struggles up undeterred

RYAN
Yes Simon they do And you love
Emily I know you do because I love
her too So much She’s the real
angel

Simon is shaking more now tears of blood stream from his
eyes

The photo of Emily suddenly bursts into flames Surprised
Ryan drops it to the snow

Simon clutches his head in an uncanny mirroring of the oil
painting that Ryan once saw in Emily’s room

SIMON
Get out of my HEAD

He tears at his hair and catches Ryan’s gaze And there’s a
glimmer of recognition there For a brief moment we see a
scared confused troubled little boy fighting against an
evil force beyond his comprehension

Ryan scrambles to his feet

RYAN
Simon

Ryan steps toward him and Simon jerks back violently And
then his eyes go black again and we catch a glimpse of that
darker creature within him and Simon beats furiously at his
head blood flowing from his lips

SIMON
GET OUT

Simon stumbles to the edge of the cliff wracked by agonizing
inner torment He reels on the edge of the abyss

Ryan tries to grab him

RYAN
Simon no

But Simon throws himself out into the air

Ryan watches in horror as Simon starts to fall and -

Suddenly stops levitating in mid-air over the vertiginous
drop

Simon’s eyes go pitch black and he grins in wicked triumph at
Ryan

SIMON
(demonic sounding)
THE BOY IS MINE

But Simon starts violently twitching again blinking like
crazy With each blink his eyes flick between the black demon
eyes and Simon’s normal eyes And blood is pouring from his
eyes now and from his ears and mouth and Simon throws his
head back and SCREAMS

Then Simon plummets downward into the abyss out of Ryan’s
line of sight

Ryan just stands there for one tense moment All is silent

Ryan picks up the axe moves forward to the edge of the
cliff nervous He peers over it -

Simons contorted body suddenly scampers up the cliff-face on

all fours like a humanoid spider His eyes are totally
black like miniature voids The thing is laughing and
spitting up blood Bones push their way out of his hands like
talons and fangs explode from his rotting gums It’s like
the inner evil of the creature is mutating its host body

SIMON (CONTD)
SIMON BELONGS TO ME FOREVER

Ryan recoils from the shocking sight but stands his ground

RYAN
Oh God Simon

The thing has almost made it up the cliff-face

RYAN (CONTD)
Think of your mother Simon
Think of Emily Don’t let this
thing use you any more

The Simon-creature begins to BAY and HOWL the internal
battle beginning again

RYAN (CONTD)
Don’t let it win Do whatever it
takes

Simon unleashes a SCREAM louder than anything weve yet
heard

Within the scream we can hear SIMON’S VOICE and also the
GRAVELLY VOICE of something much older - the ancient demon
force that is threatening to tear the child apart

Ben throws his hands over his ears as the SCREAM becomes
unbearable

Ryan raises the axe above his head tears in his eyes ready
to put Simon out of his misery But before he can -

Convulsing more violently than ever the Simon-creature’s
eyes return to normal and fix Ryan with a knowing gaze Then
the creature deliberately releases its grip and falls back
through the air It tumbles down and down and down

Ryan watches as Simon hits the unforgiving rocks far below
him At last the poor boy’s tormented body is still

Emotionally and physically exhausted and in a numb state
beyond terror Ryan drops the axe and collapses back into the
snow He stares up at the cold grey sky Snow begins to drift
down on him

Ryan and Ben just stay where they are on the edge of the
cliff for a long moment The rising sun in front of them and
the dark billowing smoke from the burning school behind them

RYAN (CONTD)
(softly to himself)
Simon won

Ryan closes his eyes as it begins to snow harder
BEN
(weakly)
You hear that

Ryan sits up He does hear something It’s a distant WHUP-
WHUP-WHUP sound

A rescue helicopter appears from over the horizon

Ryan and Ben watch as it flies over them headed toward
Briarcliff Reform School

EXT BRIARCLIFF REFORM SCHOOL - DAY

From a BIRD’S EYE VIEW we move with the helicopter as it
hovers toward the school The entire building is consumed by
flames now Lots of the boys are outside in the snow gazing
up at the helicopter

ANOTHER ANGLE - CONTINUOUS

Eric stands in front of the school covered in soot He
stares up at the approaching helicopter in disbelief

Then he sits down heavily in the snow puts his head in his
hands and starts crying like the child that he is

A strong gust of wind suddenly kicks up

EXT CLIFF FACE - LEADING TO THE CAVES - DAY

The CAMERA hurtles its way up a desolate cliff face as the
snow continues to fall heavier and heavier It’s like we’re
following the progress of some unseen unholy force as it
returns to the cave

We can hear the HOWLINGWHISTLING sound echoing angrily
within the caves above us as the CAMERA picks up more
speed

We fly up and over the lip of the cave

INT EXT THE CREVICE - CONTINUOUS

We hurtle down toward the crevice itself as the
HOWLINGWHISTLING sound bellows away gaining strength like
the demonic presence has survived

And as we move over the rim of the crevice and suddenly
plunge down into it we CUT TO BLACK
