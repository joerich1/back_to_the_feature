BOURNE (VO)
I told you people to leave me

LANDY
If he just wanted to hurt us he
could have sent this tape to CNN

KRAMER
Maybe he still will Maybe he
gave it to you because he wants
to throw you in the opposite
direction of his real plan I
dont know I just know my
number one rule is the only way
to stay safe is to assume the
worst As far as Im concerned
Bourne is a serious threat until
proven otherwise

When the Director called it was
suggested we bring you on--

LANDY

Are you sure it was just a
suggestion

VOSEN
Funny how different things look
depending on where you sit I
look at this as doing a favor for
you Giving you an opportunity
to complete some unfinished
business

LANDY
Meaning

VOSEN
Jason Bourne

LANDY
Bournes finished

VOSEN
Really
LANDY
It was finished the moment I
realized I was chasing him for
something he didnt do The
case is closed

VOSEN

So what do you make of this

(handing her

surveillance photos of

Bourne in Paris)
French intel picked up Bourne
meeting Pierre Elattrache on
Tuesday He threatened to burn
our house down if you didnt tell
him who started Treadstone
Thats a big problem wouldnt
you agree

LANDY
This doesnt feel like Bourne to
me

VOSEN
Whys it so hard for you to
believe

LANDY
Probably because its coming from
you Noah

VOSEN

Lets try and be adults okay We
all thought he was done off the
grid But Bournes back Maybe
hes a threat We both want the
same thing here

LANDY
So what happened at Waterloo

VOSEN
We have a leak Bourne showed up
in our surveillance We had very
little time to react

LANDY
And the reporter ended up dead

VOSEN
Bourne saw us coming

Landy looks at him suspicious

LANDY
So what was he doing

VOSEN
We dont know But just the fact
that he was there means hes up
to something dont you think
Maybe hes the source

LANDY
The real question is how you
managed to get in a fire fight in
the middle of a public train
station

VOSEN
Dont second guess an operation
from an armchair Pam Its not
fair

Im going to the office now

side agent doesnt have a shot while controlling the car
makes it almost impossible for the driver to fire
accurately

sidewalk But Bourne is too fast Hes already past them

EXT ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY

Bourne works to hotwire the car

A CRI car gets to the roof Two agents come from the
elevator lobby The three car alarms distract them They
search for Bourne but cant find him at first

Bourne gets the car engine on - but given the wonders of

modern anti-theft technology his steering wheel is still
locked

A second CRI car arrives

Bourne slams the car into low gear and backs up at high
speed

He smashes into the car across the aisle from him With a
sharp metallic snap the wheel in Bournes car is suddenly
free he jams the car into drive pulls out into lane and
stops

Three CRI cars here now Two head straight for him A
third blocks the exit ramp

Bourne checks the rearview and sees two more agents pour
from the elevator lobby one carrying the serious firepower
of an M-4 (an M-16 variant whose bullets can penetrate
metal and concrete) They move into position to get a bead
on him

Bourne assesses But he doesnt move The agents swarm
toward him What the hell is he doing Why is he waiting

EXT ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY

The agents clear their obstructions and drop their barrels
toward Bourne--

But before they can get a bead--

Bourne slams the car into reverse again Petal to the
metal in reverse--

The agents open fire

Bourne ducks the lead slugs ripping through the windshield
But theres no dodging the shower of broken glass

As Bourne disappears below the dashboard the CRI agent
adjusts his fire into the cars grill

Virtually blind Bourne races the hard-pressed vehicle
backwards as the agents fire decimates the cars
driveline

Bourne slips the car into neutral and takes a quick peek
behind him

Steers still speeding but quickly dying car towards a small
gap between two parked cars at the edge of the parking
structure

Bournes car splits the gap between the parked cars hits
the base of a low angled wall that slams the back of his
car up and over the wall

Bourne is pounded as his car jounces onto the wall a
second later the front end seesaws over the top the sudden
angle change exposes for an instant the bottom of Bournes
car to the shooters

Several rounds rip through the floorboard and tear past
Bournes head just before his car drops upside down for 25
feet and slams onto a row of parked cars

The impact rips Bourne from the seat and slams him hard
against the roof

Bourne struggles out of the car knowing he has only a
moment before the armed agents will fire down into his over-
turned car

Two CRI cars race down from the roof to try to get to the
level Bournes on

INT EXT PARKING GARAGE -- TWO LEVELS BELOW ROOFTOP

Bourne cuts off a guy cruising

for a parking space and

pulls him from his car and races away as the agent from the

roof lands hard behind him

Bournes race to the exit is cut off as a 3rd CRI sedan

slides into view and its occu
a head on charge

The just stolen vehicle takes

instantaneously thumbing on t
shouldering his door open and
the floor as he dives out of t

pants open fire on Bourne in

heavy fire as Bourne reacts
he cruise control

slamming the gas pedal to
he car

The agents react as Bournes sedan torpedoes them head on
Hit hard theyre taken out of the fight as metal collapses
glass shatters and airbags explode

Bourne tumbles to a stop at the rear of a parked car as his
car implodes against the oncoming agents

Instantly Bourne is on his feet moving between the parked
cars to engage another CRI sedan traveling parallel to the
course of the wrecked one

The agents in this sedan are distracted by the still
echoing crash and are caught off-guard as Bourne steps out
and points his gun at the driver

The driver ducks and floors his gas pedal in a desperate
effort to save his own life As the sedan suddenly
accelerates Bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the
sedans front tire and fires

The tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and slams
into a parked car pitching the driver violently against

the unyielding interior of the sedan

An instant later Bourne rips the radio off the dazed
drivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it

With the wreck still echoing through the garage Bourne has
to deal with the arrival of the first NYPD sedan

Bourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the on
edge cop climbs out of his car but Bournes performance is
cut short as the agent running from his drop from the roof
arrives and opens fire

The police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as
Bourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single
shot

The increasing volume of squealing tires alerts Bourne to a
new threat he pulls the officer into some cover and grabs
the officers radio

BOURNE
10-13 Shots fired Officer
down Port Authority parking
lot Level four

Bourne rips a piece of his sweater off and ties a makeshift
tourniquet for the officer Then he hands the cop his
radio back

BOURNE (CONTD)
Stay out of sight until one of
your own arrive

Bourne disappears

We pick him up as he jumps into the cops car and guns the
engine and heads for the exits

CRI agents are confused for a second -- until they pick up
the NYPD car exiting Port Authority on one of the ramps
But thats all the time Bourne needs--

276 OMITTED

277 EXT CROSSTOWN STREET -- DAY

Bourne turns on his lights and siren and speeds east
followed closely by a CRI sedan

As cars yield to Bournes siren a taxi tries to jump into
Bournes wake but a CRI sedan punches the taxi back to the

right It ricochets off several parked cars before
regaining control

EXT CROSSTOWN STREET -- DAY

Bourne struggles to keep his over-matched vehicle ahead of
the more powerful CRI Sedan which tries to spin Bourne out
by hitting his bumper

Bourne tacks right quickly and barely avoids a stopped car
The CRI sedan flanking Bournes slams into the rear of that
car spinning it 180 degrees into the path of the trailing
CRI sedan which destroys itself in the resulting collision
and blocks the path of the other CRI sedan

INT BOURNES CAR -- DAY

Bourne is home free He looks around and spots a sign that
indicates a right turn and says To Holland Tunnel US
95 Bourne turns right--

Suddenly the window next to his head explodes as two more
shots rip through his door to tear a jagged wound into the
top of Bournes leg

REVEAL Paz his SUV racing along the curb lane As

Bournes car crosses in front of a small car stopped at the
intersection Paz swerves his car into that car and punches
it into the side of Bournes car

Bournes car is knocked spinning Paz keeps charging
forward and slams into the back of Bournes car With his
front tires spinning wildly Bourne fights to straighten his
car as another CRI sedan appears and tries to box Bournes
car by sliding into his path

OMITTED

284 EXT MANHATTAN STREET -- DAY

Bourne just manages to punch his car into the right rear of
the CRI Sedan and race down the Avenue with Paz and the
slightly damaged sedan in pursuit

Paz gains on him and Bourne is forced to swerve violently
to deny Paz the kill shot he is all too capable of

Just ahead of Bourne two government SUVs slide into the
intersection completely blocking his path

Bourne instantly spins his car 180 degrees and continues
on barreling into the roadblock backwards

As Bournes car plows through the SUVs he whips the wheel
and his car spins through a reverse 180 as Paz and the
other sedan race through the wreckage in Bournes wake

Paz and the CRI sedan are all over Bourne as he slides a
right hand turn onto South St as Paz and the CRI sedan
overwhelm Bournes battered vehicle

284A OMITTED 284A

287 INT BOURNES CAR -- DAY

On his police radio Bourne singles out an NYPD officer
(call sign Alpha-2503) racing toward the intersection just
ahead

Bourne slows then speeds up quickly to time it right

The CRI car almost hits his bumper then has to accelerate
through the upcoming intersection As he does the cop car
Bourne was listening to on the radio slams broadside into
the CRI sedan drafting the bumper of the mangled cop car

Swerving wildly Paz avoids the pileup and slams his heavy
SUV into the back of Bournes car pushing him into the
oncoming traffic

Several cars swerve left and right as Paz pushes Bourne
sideways onto the ramped end of a K-Rail dividing the
street ahead

The nearly upended car grinds down the K-Rail until the
rear of Bournes car strikes an obstruction which punches
it back into the lane as it slams against the front of
Pazs SUV knocking the SUV sideways into a row of parked
cars

Bournes car hits parked cars on the other side of the

road
