MUSIC “GUILTY” (Barbra Streisand and Barry Gibb)

EXT PEACEFUL SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - BEAUTIFUL DAY 1

CLOSE UP LITTLE BOY’S legs red sneakers with white socks
pedaling fast on a bicycle Basket full of newspapers

Reveal it’s a CUTE ASIAN BOY wearing A YELLOW BASEBALL HAT
and typical young boy clothes He’s wearing headphones

happy

As the song’s lyrics begin he LIP-SYNC’s along perfectly as
he tosses the newspapers into yards

The BOY KEEPS RIDING UNTIL

EXT SMALL BLUE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 2

He STOPS riding no longer smiling He throws a NEWSPAPER
onto the front porch With a menacing look bikes away

EXT RURAL STREETS 3
He rides through a more rural area Fewer houses Scenery is

changing Even less houses Keeps riding

EXT FARMLAND 4

Now in total FARMLAND he stops He looks around
suspiciously and takes his headphones off

MUSIC stops A LONE TREE in the middle of a distant field We
hear the wind as the leaves blow

He walks his bike across the dry field to the tree

As the boy looks up at the branches A FAKE MECHANICAL OWL
turns his head to the boy a red light appears in its eyes
scans the boy and suddenly a DOOR IN THE TREE TRUNK OPENS
revealing a metal ELEVATOR The boy ENTERS pushes the only
button it reads “LAIR” Doors close

INT ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 5

As he rides we see SHEAR ROCK FACE pass through the small
window behind him We are descending deep into the earth
END OPENING CREDITS

INT UNDERGROUND HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 6

The elevator doors open we follow the BOYS FEET WALKING
along shiny metal floors Soon another set of feet join his

SECURITY GUARD (0S)
Morning Yoyo

YOYO (0OS)
Morning Gene Has it started

Tilt up

SECURITY GUARD
They’re waiting for you sir You
better get changed

YOYO the boy stops at a METAL DOOR scans his fingerprints
the door opens He enters the door shuts and he immediately
comes back out wearing a SUIT and an EARRING fully dressed
like a man

He crosses the hall to large doors scans and walks through

INT LAIR - CONTINUOUS 7

YOYO’S POV Camera slowly enters revealing a reddish lit
living room dark wood walls brown leather COUCHES a HUGE
BEAR SKIN RUG many CANDLES and some unnaturally large ones

AN ELDERLY SCIENTIST in a WHITE COAT waits alone under a
bright light He looks over leaning against a nearby wall is
EDGAR PAGET early 40’s Handsome impeccable serious We
hear a THROAT CLEARING Edgar stands up straight

We see the SILHOUETTE of a TALL WOMAN emerge from the shadows
of the room As she comes into the light her all-white and
cream FLOWY CLOTHING almost glows This is SHARON GORDON
FISHERMAN Her hair is black a futuristic hair cut we’ve
never seen before Her skin is flawless and pale She looks
to Yoyo “Did you do it” He nods back She smiles
maliciously She is beyond intimidating icy Scientist is
nervous

SHARON GORDON FISHERMAN
Would anyone like a drink before we
get started

SCIENTIST
No thank you
SHARON GORDON FISHERMAN
Well I’m going to make myself a
“suicide” Are you familiar with
that drink Dr Bradley

He shakes his head no

She walks gracefully taking full advantage of her cape and
slowly approaches a 7-11 type SODA MACHINE She takes a
LARGE PLASTIC CUP and fills it with ice which falls loudly
into the cup She then begins filling the cup with each soda

SHARON GORDON FISHERMAN (CONTD)
(to herself)
A little bit of Root Beer
traditional cola a touch of Lemon
Lime Fizz Orange Up and my secret

ingredient a dash of lemon-
infused Iced tea I like the extra
bite

She sips from the cup then goes back to the Root Beer for
one last splash She Yoyo and Edgar approach the scientist

EDGAR
Is it ready

SCIENTIST
Finally yes

SHARON and Edgar share a pleased look

SHARON GORDON FISHERMAN
Wonderful

They walk towards a room with a covered window As the
curtain opens

SCIENTIST
After months of work I have
genetically modified the mosquitos

They look into a stark-white room where a COW stands Theres
a small black box on the floor near its feet Yoyo evilly
cracks his knuckles SHARON gives him a stop it look

SCIENTIST (CONTD)
This remote here activates that
receiver under the cow releasing a
signal instantly attracting the
mosquitos aggravating them and
increasing their taste for blood
(MORE)
SCIENTIST (CONTD)
These aren’t just itchy mosquito
bites One sting will kill a large
animal within minutes

SHARON GORDON FISHERMAN
Show me

The scientist flips a switch Inside the room a small PANEL
on the wall opens In it ONE MOSQUITO The scientist presses
the remote control The receiver LIGHTS UP The mosquito
flies directly towards it stings the cow It lets out a
painful moo Edgar winces We hear the cow fall on the floor
Dead

SHARON GORDON FISHERMAN (CONTD)
It’s perfect

The scientist looks on proud She begins pacing

SHARON GORDON FISHERMAN (CONTD)
So hypothetically speaking if the
receiver was placed lets say in
the middle of a small town the
mosquitoes would then fly towards
it Stinging and killing everyone
in the town Hypothetically

The scientist takes a second to comprehend

SCIENTIST
Well it depends I mean if you
have thousands of mosquitos I
guess you could kill thousands of
people but we wouldn’t want to
do that Right

Sharon smiles at him mischievously He smiles back unsure

SCIENTIST (CONTD)
I mean that’s not not what this is
for Right We are using these to
kill animals with rabies Right

Off her look

SCIENTIST (CONTD)
In South Africa Right They
have a problem of rabid herds of
animals You said That’s why we
did this Right you guys Right

His face falls This was NOT the plan Two guards approach

SCIENTIST (CONTD)
(panicked)
Wait You cant get away with this
My house is full of evidence I
have all our e-mails your checks-

SHARON GORDON FISHERMAN
Oh weve taken care of that

She nods to Yoyo Quick zoom in as he pinches his earring It
lights up Beep
EXT BLUE HOUSE WHERE HE THREW THE NEWSPAPER - CONTINUOUS 8

The newspaper beeps the house explodes Debris flies

INT LAIR - CONTINUOUS 9

The two guards drag the scientist into the white room As he
screams for his life Sharon presses the remote There is an
ominous buzz as hundreds of mosquitoes are released into the
room as he continues to scream Edgar cant look

SHARON GORDON FISHERMAN
Goodbye Dr Bradley

Off Sharon’s smile we-

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY 10

Various close up shots of two MIDDLE AGED WOMEN’s body parts
slightly moving to the music Hands lightly slapping a thigh
a foot in a practical pump tapping along wavy MIDWESTERN

HAIR (think Tootsie) swaying along small shoulder moves etc

This is BARB and STAR 40-ish sitting on a couch drinking
tea They are middle America small-town women Straight out
of a CHICO’S catalog

BARB
Whenever I watch those movies where
you’re in the 1800s I can’t stop
thinking did everybody just you
know Gosh I dont wanna be rude--
STAR
Stink I think of that too Those
stories when the daughter of the
king sneaks into the barn with a
farmhand doesn’t he just reek of
BO and bad breath

BARB
They didn’t have deodorant There
were no toilets They just went all
over the place They didn’t brush
their teeth

STAR
Well I think I’ve seen an old
timey toothbrush and they’re wood
and they have brown horse hair

BARB
I want one of those I wish I was
alive then and was still alive
now

They sip their tea
BARB (CONTD)

Pennsylvania Dutch do

in there flying around in the
cushions with other fly eggs that

to hear ‘em if you don’t have the
TV on real loud

MALE CUSTOMER

STAR
Two separate ladies have passed
away on this couch

BARB
And their spirits are in this couch

lady moaning in it at night

FEMALE CUSTOMER

caffeine--

STAR

Banana Boat The two of us hitting
a wave and getting launched into
the air with our arms and legs
spread open The wind going
everywhere Inside us

BARB
A banana boat That’s dangerous
Plus a trip Things happen to
people on trips What if we get
lost or poisoned or get a rash
What if we get put in jail because
they think we put drugs in our
butts What if we fall out of a
car The doctors don’t have our
charts they don’t know or medical
histories Have you heard of
travelers diarrhea

STAR
But Barb I mean haven’t you ever
wondered if the real ocean sounds
like our noise machine

BARB
The real ocean has strong currents
People get swept away and they
scream and then they sink And
then they die

Star walks over and sits on Barb’s bed

STAR
We used to have fun I know things
changed for you after Ron died I
mean they sure did after Carmine

EXT BEACH 53

Edgar runs on the beach rips his shirt off and begins a
frustrated angry emotional DANCE

- He is leaping and jazz kicking his way across the beach
- Throughout the song he spots different seagulls referenced
in the lyrics (seagull on the wall seagull eating trash

seagulls in a group)

- He twirls in the sand like a ballerina spinning himself
down into a hole sand flying as he spins

- He climbs up a palm tree like a cat He opens his arms wide
from atop the palm tree

- At one point a GOSPEL SINGER enters frame and starts
belting out the song emotionally

- The final verse shows him rapid fire doing these specific
activities running kicking twisting crying resting
looking eating leaning digging skipping dreaming

- The song ends with him emotionally exhausted perhaps out
in the ocean spent

life a bit I mean--

ATTRACTIVE MAN
At some point we must ask ourselves
who we are Which side is truly me

BARB
You or me

ATTRACTIVE MAN
You You are finding your courage
your voice Yet you feel burdened
with the untruth of your new
existence because you hide it
from the ones you love

BARB
Gosh I do struggle with the guilt
But I have to admit I’ve never
felt more alive Am I a bad friend

ATTRACTIVE MAN
You can only be a friend if you’re
a friend to yourself first that
is where you will find your truth

BARB
What if I don’t know my truth

ATTRACTIVE MAN
--what if you do

ATTRACTIVE MAN (CONTD)
Youre opening a channel within
you beckoning the voice of
courage and a divine rebirth is
impending The stars are whispering
to me You are being delivered Now
is the time to mount the wind and
ride it with the fierceness of a
hippopotamus I can hear the scream
from the powerful voice of Now

Edgar walks up and sees a PAPER BAG in front of his door In
big letters it says “Edgar’s disguise for private meeting

It is imperative that you wear this so as to not be
recognized Love Darlie Bunkle age 46 weight 178
dammit” Edgar looks around suspiciously and goes inside

EXT PASTA AND STUFF RESTAURANT - NIGHT 90

Establishing shot of Pasta and Stuff

INT PASTA AND STUFF RESTAURANT - EVENING 91

The restaurant is old school Floridian flare- plastic
flamingo with a moustache alligator holding a pizza statue
of “David” on a surfboard etc Few patrons Edgar in a booth
wears a white blonde Hulk Hogan wig and a white T-SHIRT that
says TYLENOL

He notices a MAN AT THE BAR jerking his head around overly
suspicious DARLIE BUNKLE He’s wearing a full lime green
ZOOT SUIT FEATHER in his hat and bright NECK SCARF the
farthest thing from subtle

EDGAR
Psst Psst

Darlie whips his head around spies Edgar then quickly gives
him a loud “shh” sign Making sure the coast is clear (which
it is) he walks in an over-the-top cartoon-ey tip-toe way

DARLIE
Were you followed

EDGAR
No

DARLIE

No one who gets followed ever
thinks that they were So you
probably were

EDGAR
Why am I wearing a t-shirt that
says Tylenol

DARLIE
I needed something quick so I
grabbed it from my wife’s closet
Besides you never know who is
lurking

They both look around There is a YOUNG FATHER and his 10-
year-old DAUGHTER enjoying lunch together giggling Then--

EDGAR
Do you have the micro-chip

DARLIE
It’s in my pocket

He tries for a bit to reach deep into his pocket gives up

DARLIE (CONTD)
These suit pockets are too deep
Hmm If I stand up to try to get
it it might look suspect

EDGAR
I don’t think it would

DARLIE
We can’t risk compromising the
plan I’m going to get up go into
the bathroom pretend to stretch my

hammies--—

EDGAR
Oh my god Can’t you just hand it
to me

DARLIE

Shh The girl will hear you Are
you serious about this mission or

not

EDGAR
Yes I think- I mean yes Of course
I am

DARLIE

Good I’ve been put in charge here
and if I feel its better for me to
go into the bathroom to get this
microchip out then that’s what
were doing

(loud)
We have to be careful this has to
be PRIVATE

EDGAR
Enough with the private

DARLIE
Hey youre in no position to call
the shots here buster You know
who’s been questioning your
loyalty

(MORE)

DARLIE (CONTD)
Thats why she asked me to keep an
eye on you since you got here

EDGAR
What Youve been following me
Just give me the chip

He reaches towards Darlie People start to stare

DARLIE
Stop it You’re calling attention
what are you doing

EDGAR
Give it to me

DARLIE
You have compromised this
environment I’m aborting this
mission Now I’m going to sneak
out subtly so you can see how it’s
done Amateur

Darlie stands immediately trips on a chair grabbing a
tablecloth everything crashes and breaks He then shuffles
over behind a PLANT which knocks an awning ROD loose that
swings into a FRUIT CHANDELIER which falls into the
FOUNTAIN which sends WATER flying onto the floor which
makes a waiter slip across the floor and crash into JUKE BOX

LITTLE GIRL
It’s that man right there Him
He’s been acting weird the whole
time

“The DJ’s Got us Fallin’ in Love Again” by USHER comes on
the chorus plays on the jukebox

Darlie’s zoot suit chain gets stuck on the plant he tries to
pull back and sends a DESSERT CART rolling into a STATUE OF
DAVID which falls over onto pizza paddle holding a 4ft pizza
which flies through the air and lands on a TINY OLD WOMAN

A bunch of CHICKENS run through followed by three old ITALIAN
WOMEN with rolling pins The old lady still with the pizza on
her head sways to the music

Darlie swaps outfits with an accordion player dressed as a
gondolier and tries to escape up the stairs playing the
accordion Towards the top he turns smack into a waiter
carrying a tiered cake He falls backwards down the stairs
and the cake lands on his face at the bottom

Edgar finally grabs the microchip out of Darlie’s pocket and
leaves The CHEF enters and THROWS A BUNCH OF PAPERS in the
air

this awful thing

EDGAR
(sighs)
Fine Ill tell you

Edgar pulls up a seat

As he tell his story the girls work at freeing themselves
Their bracelets make a lot of noise Occasionally he looks at
them and they freeze Sometimes they are holding loose ropes
pretending to still be bound He never notices

EDGAR (CONTD)
When I was 7 years old my father
left my mom my eleven sisters and
me We had no money I was the
oldest and had to support us I did
odd jobs I worked for Chevrolet I
even tried to sell my poop to
farmers saying it was fertilizer
It was never enough My mom was
struggling to feed us When I was
15 I would juggle lemons on street
corners and throw rocks in the air
and catch them in my mouth for
coins One day a woman wearing a
cape and bag over her head put 50
in my cup She needed an errand boy
back in America and offered to pay
me more than I have ever made in my
life 10 dollars Per month So I
did it Over time she began asking
more from me and paying me more

He gets up and goes to the window

EDGAR (CONTD)
She started to seduce me as the
errands became more criminal I
fell under her spell

(MORE )
EDGAR (CONTD)
I thought it was love I would do
anything for her She’d always
talked about this particular plan
her life’s work and when it came
time to help her I said yes Of
course I had reservations but she
said when it was over we could be
an official couple and that’s
all I wanted at the time Its all
Ive ever wanted People do crazy
things for love

STAR
Yeah but I mean killing people
That’s a lot

BARB
Yeah thats a lot of people its a
little crazy

EDGAR
Is it

He turns to them they freeze They are basically free
doesnt notice

EDGAR (CONTD)
Wouldn’t you have done it for
Carmine Wouldn’t you for Ron

He begins to leave

STAR
Wait How do you know about Barbs
dead husband Ron Quicksilver

EDGAR
She told me when she came to see
me That first night on the foot
bridge right before you did

Barb and Star step out of the ropes

BARB
Yes I admit it I snuck out of the
bathroom window that night and kept
it from you But nothing happened
I felt too guilty and frankly
Edgar’s not my type You know I
like black men who love corn mazes

STAR
Dont try to change the subject
You still lied

BARB
Yours was worse Youve been
pretending to be sick every single
day and withheld romantic
information

STAR
Well if we’re both so comfortable
lying to each other so willy nilly
maybe we’re not real friends at
all

BARB
Maybe we’re not But there are
more important things happening
right now People are gonna die We
have to find Edgar

This weighs on Star hes betrayed her

STAR
Youre right We have to stop him

BARB
We have to kill him
(off Star’s look)
Or well just stop him first And
well think about it and see what
our comfort level is

STAR
I agree with the second part But
by me agreeing with you about
having to stop Edgar I don’t agree
about stopping being mad at you I
just wanna make that clear

BARB
So we agree to go but I want you
to know that I’m frustrated and
hurt and I’m really freakin’ pissed
off

STAR
Well I’m really freakin’ pissed
off not because I’m copying you
but you should know that I am and
I’m not talking to you even though
I am

way down ripping your skin at every
crash or stay and have dinner
with my new friends

Two large ALLIGATORS GROWL from crates

SHARON GORDON FISHERMAN (CONTD)
So whatll it be A free flight off

STAR
And you can just forget what we
used to talk about when we get to

other and running around playing
harps in our halos and wings

BARB
I’m not even gonna look for you
I’m gonna find the farthest cloud
away from yours and I’m gonna find
Betsy Ross and be best friends with
her And we’re gonna ignore you at
all the parties

Alligators are almost there

STAR
Fine I’m not gonna say anything
else before I jump

BARB
Me neither I guess we’re gonna die
on bad terms

STAR
Guess we are This is it

STAR (CONTD)
I guess it is

They can’t find the words They are so angry And scared A
very close ALLIGATOR opens its jaws and lunges at them

Finally they have to JUMP OFF THE CLIFF Barb and Star
tumble in the air to their deaths Then Poof They almost
STOP mid-air Something has slowed them down

STAR (CONTD)
What the--

Their CULOTTES have PUFFED UP FULL OF AIR and are acting like
parachutes

BARB
Our culottes

STAR
Theyre natural parachutes

They’re gonna live They slowly smile at each-other and grasp
hands as float down gently and land gracefully on the sand
They immediately hug

STAR (CONTD)
I’m so sorry Lying to you was the
hardest thing I’ve ever done

BARB
I’m sorry too

STAR
No this is all my fault None of
this would be happening if I didn’t
suggest coming on this trip

BARB
Are you kidding Because of you

thought I would do Star I went in

pierced--

mistakes and they don’t know any
better
