FADE IN
EXT ENGLAND ROLLING GRASSY HILLS DAY

Horses hooves gallop in ‘close up as the black horse
races up the grassy hill at full stride kicking up soil
and grass

To the stirrup area and we see the pointed and
engraved boots of the cowboy resplendent in very
ornate spurs Kicking to make his horse go faster

The hooves of the white horse also churns up the grass
as it gives chase

And as we track up to the stirrup area we see Indian
Moccasins fringed and beaded These feet also are doing
their best to pick up the horses speed

A wide panoramic view of rolling hills and blue sky as
we travel along from above A fast paced chase below
between a Cowboy and an Indian looks for all the world
like the traditional western scene The Cowboy is a few
yards in the lead with the Indian gaining fast

Up the steep hill the two speed towards the ridge
above It is as though the two may ride off the edge of
the world The Indian in pursuit becomes distracted by
the shadow of a bird travelling along with him He
looks up squinting against the sun to see a white bird
flying some way above in the same direction

The Indian gives up the chase and pulls back his horse
to watch the direction of the white bird The bird
continues its flight over the head of the cowboy who
by now has stopped and sits at the crest of the hill
with his back still to the Indian The Indian slowly
rides to the side of the motionless Cowboy

From the front we see the handsome face of the Cowboy
JOHNNY BAKER and stern face of the Indian JOE ELK wide
eyed and silent JOHNNY BAKER is already looking
forward but JOE ELK tracks his eyes from the bird to
the view below JOE ELKS eyes widen as

JOHNNY BAKER
Jeez

The camera tracks around them and we see a vista that
stretches as far as the eye can see Like a bubbling

cauldron the heavy clouds of smoke billowing from a
thousand factory chimneys Some visible belching flame
and smoke The cloud hangs heavy like a seething ocean
An eerie sound of pounding hammers below

JOE ELK catches site of the bird as it descends into
the cloud

CUT TO
EXT INDUSTRIAL TOWN ALLEY DAY

In the industrial regions below a shrill factory
whistle blows against the drum like beating of a
hundred foundry hammers ADAM (ADDY) PRICE a poorly
dressed 11-year old urchin wearing an oversized cloth
cap slips and slides into view around a corner

A brown paper bag he is carrying falls to the ground
and out of it spills a string of sausages Wide-eyed
and breathless he runs towards us into a blind alley
with no escape Splashing through deep pools he looks
behind him A GANG of youths and a large dog also slip
and slide into view some way back One of the youths
slides a little too far on his wooden clogs and crashes
out of site through an old door The others in the
group laugh The dog makes quick work of gobbling up
the sausages

In the lead is local ruffian JONUS PYKE who skids to a
stop remaining focused on his prey PYKE displaying
his yellow and broken teeth grins at the boy ADDY
cowers as PYKE reaches out and pulls off ADDYs cap
revealing his long dark curly hair The others in
PYKEs crowd laugh Two of Pykes thugs come forward
with a bucket containing feathers and a black oily
substance

EXT INDUSTRIAL STREET DAY

ADDY Walks silently through the industrial street He

the only thing of value in the house A very ornate
mans silver watch on a heavy chain She points at the
watch

ADDY stands and walks to the cabinet by the side of

eyes he holds his breath and takes the watch off the
frame HETTIE claps ADDY takes a bow and places it in
her hand She struggles with her little hands to open
the heavy watch

In extreme close up A large fly cleans itself on the
wooden gate In a second an arrow thuds into the wood
and the fly is buried deep into the wood at the tip of
the arrow We pull back to reveal that where the fly
once stood is a crude chalk picture of JONUS PYKE
complete with yellow chalk teeth

The arrow firmly stuck into the forehead of JONUS
PYKES picture ADDY though dressed differently still
has a number of feathers stuck to the back of his hair
Alongside ADDY there are clear signs of a serious fire
in the yard along the boundary fence ADDY loads
another arrow and with one eye open searches the area
for another target The cat sitting licking itself on
top of the shed the street gas lamp the next door

and the terrified face of FLORRIE HAMMOND is seen She
screams but we hear no sound through the glass
Terrified FLORRIE calls someone else in the room A
slightly built man appears next to her His jaw drops
The curtain is dropped instantly

ADDY breathes in deeply as he looks at the picture of
PYKE Then with lightning speed in one fluid movement
ADDY loads and fires the remaining four arrows in a
blur of precision movement Each one landing square in
the forehead of the image on the picture

ADDY is removing arrows when the gate begins to shake
violently as someone is banging on it from the other
side

DAN PRICE steps out into the daylight dripping wet and
stark naked DAN looks across his small yard at ADDY
who is pulling out the arrows from the picture The
gate continues to bang annoyingly DAN is clearly very
angry at ADDY In fact DAN is generally a very angry
man He walks to the gate and opens it Standing the
other side is FLORRIE HAMMOND and her much smaller
husband GEORGE FLORRIE squints in disgust at the naked
form of DAN PRICE Her husband clearly very
embarrassed does not know where to put his eyes

GEORGE

GEORGE looks back at his wife who looks at him
disapprovingly and urges him to get on with it

GEORGE interrupts

GEORGE
Steady on FLORRIE hes

FLORRIE and GEORGE both hesitate and so

DAN (CONTD)

With that DAN slams the gate on the couple and turns
to face ADDY

ADDY flinches as DAN picks up the bow which is leaning
on the fence DAN tries to snap it but even his
strength cant break the springy wood DAN grabs ADDY
by his shirt drags him into his workshop and throws
the bow onto a stack of coal and wood DAN turns on
ADDY who backs into the corner as DAN looms over him

EXT WIDE STREET MORNING

Mist swirls and the hammers pound as ADDY and DAN
continue to walk in silence It is a hive of activity
and excited children up ahead attract the attention of
both of them

A strange and ethereal vision moves towards them
through the mist and swirling smoke Two figures on
horseback riding slowly and followed by a crowd of
children ADDY squints to focus on the figures Slowly
the images become clearer almost taking ADDYs breath
away JOHNNY BAKER in full cowboy regalia and by his
side JOE ELK in eagle-feathered head-dress and
carrying a lance are riding towards them ADDY is
frozen to the spot in fascination All his Christmases
have come at once JOHNNYs white stetson and steel
blue eyes seem to shine out like a beacon through the

EXT BOTTLE AND GLASS PUB MORNING

ADDY sits on the kerb reading his poster A large gang
of weary black faced miners scrape heavy clogs across
the cobble stone street towards the pub Ducking in and
out of the miners are a rag tag group of children all
with their hands out for pennies Some are pushed away
but the lucky ones get the pennies from their weary

fathers The miners file into the already overfilled
pub The moment the miners are gone a gang of nearby
youths step in and begin taking the pennies from the
kids A clip round their ears sends the little ones
off JONUS PYKE a tall gangly youth with a face
blistered by acne looks over to ADDY studying his
poster PYKE holds out his hand and gathers the pennies
from his own group The other children gather and laugh
as PYKE reaches out and grabs ADDYs poster

PYKE
Whats this

ADDY leaps up and tries to grab his poster back

PYKE (CONTD)
Uh Oh

He holds ADDY at bay while he examines the poster

PYKE (CONTD)
Buffalo Bill Hes a queer just
like you with his hair like a girl

PYKE holds ADDYs poster way above his head so ADDY
cannot reach it The others laugh at PYKEs actions
ADDY is shaking with fear as he is hit with his own
poster across the head again and again PYKE gets
serious and uses his much greater bulk to drag ADDY
quite a way down the street In true bully form PYKE
holds ADDY close to his filthy yellow teeth and takes
a knife out of his pocket which he holds threateningly
at Addys crotch

PYKE (CONTD)
If you want to keep your little
marbles you get that watch of ya
dads off ya granddad Ill be
waiting under the viaduct at the
change of the night shift siren
You be there with it in the
morning No watch

PYKE makes a swishing movement with his knife

PYKE (CONTD)
Do you understand

ADDY who is very scared nods his head in reluctant
agreement PYKE rolls up the poster and drops it into
the open drain nearby The poster falls to the ledge
below PYKE begins to walk away as ADDY lies down and
at full stretch tries to reach his poster Glancing
back PYKE sees this and cant resist ADDYS precarious
position He rushes back and pushes ADDY into the drain
and slams the iron grid shut trapping ADDY inside As
they all run off laughing PYKE shouts back

PYKE (CONTD)

Tomorrow by the viaduct or youll
be flushed away with the other
turds

ADDY is at the bottom of the deep filthy drain Water
from the gutter running into the drain is soaking him
as he tries to keep his poster dry Shivering ADDY
tries to push the grid open He cant budge it Water
cascades down on him

The ROOM is silent JOHNNY turns to the CROWD

JOHNNY

JOHNNY searches the room Spotting DAN JOHNNY walks
over to DAN and points at him

JOHNNY

JOHNNY calls upon the rest of the room who now are
fully concentrating on him

JOHNNY (CONTD)
Sir I recognize that in these
parts a man has to prove himself
Surely you would not deny me that

BASH

Others in the room begin to agree calling out for DAN
to do it Finally and with little choice DAN slowly
stands and JOHNNY turns to the crowd applauding DAN
Many others join in

JOHNNY
Now sir I have kept this very
simple for you

JOHNNY is milking DANs forced arm a little
JOHNNY (CONTD)
Just hold your hands like this and

DAN waits a while and claps as fast as he can As his
hands close the gun is there between them Everyone in
the room claps and JOHNNY turns and takes off his hat
to accept the applause

JOHNNY (CONTD)
Just to show no hard feelings sir
Please have a cigar

JOHNNY places a cigar in DANs mouth and lighting a
match on the back of his own pants he lights DANs
cigar before turning his back to walk toward the bar
saying

JOHNNY (CONTD)
One month gentlemen the biggest
show arena in the world needs to be
erected right here in your town We

willing to work

As JOHNNY reaches the bar he spins around drawing his
gun In one motion he fires three times in fast
succession each shot chipping away some of the cigar in
DANs mouth leaving just a tiny stub JOHNNY
impressively spins his gun and returns it to its
holster The house erupts into applause Everyone in
the room is happy except for DAN People rush past DAN
to sign up for work and get their free drink Crowding

to hopefully attract attention ADDYs lips are pressed
against the grid to breathe Suddenly the drain is
filled with light as the drain lid is lifted ADDY is
wide eyed as an open handed buckskin fringed gauntlet
reaches down to him ADDY slowly reaches out to the
hand and grasps it Looking up the brightness of the
light prevents ADDY seeing beyond the mouth of the
drain The leather fingers of the glove curl
reassuringly around his tiny hand As ADDYs eyes
adjust to the light outside the drain he is open
mouthed at the sight of JOE ELK standing there Behind

DAN slouches open-mouthed and dribbling Fast asleep in
his easy chair sleeping off his excessive drinking
bout A single candle flickers Slowly he begins to
wake Wiping the dribble off his chin DAN stretches and
moans as though his awkward position has seized every
bone in his body

DANs eyes open and he tries to focus Sitting in front
of him across the table is HETTIE She has feathers in
her hair and she has a turned down mouth Trying to
look like an Indian she stares at DAN

DAN
What you looking at

As DANs eyes focus he tracks next to HETTIE
An expression of total horror appears on DANs face

DAN (CONTD)
Oh my God

DAN leaps to his feet almost tipping backwards over his
chair His trousers opened at the waist for comfort
begin to slip down as DAN catches their fall Less than
three yards from him sitting at his table next to

HETTIE is Chief JOE ELK in full eagle feather head-
dress simply looking at DAN stone faced

DAN (CONTD)
What the hell

Stepping into view from the side and further
exasperating DAN is JOHNNY

JOHNNY
Sir is the kid your son

DAN swings round to look at JOHNNY and shakes his head
as he gathers his thoughts He is clearly still very
intoxicated

DAN
Addy Hes not my son hes my
sons son What has the little
idiot done now

DAN fights to put on his shirt ADDY enters the room
from upstairs dressed in dry clothing and holding the

Indian blanket DAN leaps at him and grabs ADDY by
the ear

DAN (CONTD)
You little what the hell

DAN raises his hand to hit ADDY but is caught by JOE in
mid swing JOE looks very seriously at DAN

JOE
The boy did nothing to be punished
for We helped him and brought him
home

JOE looks deeply into DANs eyes

JOE (CONTD)
No-hit-boy

Probably for the first time in DANs life he is
frightened JOE moves his face very close to DAN and
simply glares at him stone faced Then moving back and
turning round JOE winks at ADDY The two leave DAN
standing holding his trousers ADDY holds JOEs blanket
and glancing at DAN he walks up the stairs

tightly in his fist He turns and kneels by HETTIEs

slowly wakes ADDY places his finger on his lips for
her to be quiet He slowly picks up HETTIE and she
sleepily whispers

HETTIE

ADDY holds HETTIE in one arm and picking up his
belongings with the other throws his bow over his
shoulder HETTIE drops her doll as they slowly move
across the room trying not to wake the snoring farting
DAN HETTIE reaches out for her doll ADDY shakes his
head for her to leave it She accepts this As they
pass DANs bed ADDY hesitates for a second Then he
takes out the watch and replaces it on DANs cabinet
and they slowly begin to go down the stairs

Agonisingly each stair creeks loudly At the bottom
they begin to move across the room ADDY slowly pulls
back the creaking door bolt and gently opens the door
As they are about to exit ADDY is grabbed from behind
HETTIE screams as DAN shouts

DAN

Where do you think youre off to

ADDY struggles as DAN tries to hold on to them both
HETTIE begins to kick DAN and bites the arm that is
holding on to ADDY DAN screams and lets go as ADDY is
free He looks at HETTIE

at the top of the ramp door in the livestock carriage
is high and ADDY decides to climb His nerves begin to
get the worse of him and his repeating actions take
control and he keeps stepping on and off the train He
taps out furiously on the side of the carriage The
frustration on ADDYS face is plain as if to say Not
now ADDY eventually gains a grip and drags himself up
the side of the carriage as it slowly begins to pick up

disembark and there are firm hand shakes all round as

consideration After all what would

You are welcome any time gentlemen
This is a great day in the history
of this extravaganza New money and
a new start Excellent

There is an air of excitement as the men all shake
hands again The men climb aboard the car and leave the
scene in a cloud of smoke BILL waves them off and
takes out a cigar He turns to look at the BUFFALO
BILL sign and draws on his cigar with pride as the
smoke slowly disperses Both he and the filthy ADDY are
standing side by side admiring the view

BILL senses someone is standing close by He is clearly
in a very good mood He hardly looks at the boy and
reaches for his pocket saying

BILL (CONTD)

my girl Something you can tell
your grand kids about

BILL takes out some tickets and hands them to ADDY
BILL pats ADDY on the head

BILL (CONTD)
Bring your friends

As BILL strides to the entrance he cant help but look
at his hand after touching the filthy childs hair He
takes out his red handkerchief and wipes his hand as he
walks into the showground

hustle and bustle greets him Horses riding to and fro
ridden by men in strange costumes ADDY looking so
small and vulnerable wanders around the site At the
edge of the arena he stands watching a group of COWBOYS
trick riding So many languages and exotic costumes
ADDY cannot take it all in and looks around him as he
strolls through the city of ropes tents and canopies
flapping gently in the summer breeze Hearing a voice
raised ADDY stops a safe distance from the source
Exiting a short distance from the opening at the front
of a large tent is a petite dark haired lady looking
pretty in light tan buckskins the chest area of which
is covered in badges and medals The lady ANNIE
OAKLEY has a pronounced limp and sits painfully as an
older thicker set man follows her out ANNIE is
speaking as she sits

ANNIE
Well Ill give it a go but I cant
promise you a miracle I doubt I
could even do it before the

The man seems to be pleading with her

done

ANNIE
I cant let Bill down It aint the
shooting I could do it sat ona

ANNIE (CONTD)
Maybe I should just retire and let
Bill find somebody else

MAN
Find somebody else Honey there

clearly overwhelmed to see it His eyes widen at the
sight of the Deadwood Stage linked to a team of white
horses ADDY walks to the Stage and runs his hand over
the yellow painted wheels ADDY cannot resist a look
inside and climbs up and into the open door ADDY
closes the door behind him The seats are leather and
well worn ADDY takes his bow from his shoulder and
sits in the seat Every fantasy is coming true for the

keen on the military showcase that
you have built but thiserWild
West thing Its all from another

BILL
I dont quite see exactly What are
your plans

MAN ONE

The idea of showing our military
prowess to those nations that would
do us harm Flexing our muscle
under their noses in the guise of
entertainment has great interest
toour associates With you at the
head as you have always been and

BILL is beginning to understand
BILL
A curiosity A freak to draw in
your crowds Gentlemen you
underestimate me I am old this is
true but I can still outride
outshoot and kick the arse of
anyone who is still standing in
front of me when I finish counting
to fiveOneTwo

It takes to the count of three before they realise he
is threatening them and they back off and disperse very

hastily

BILL turns to the arena and catches the eye of ANNIE

his eyes off ADDY

The men move away from the fence as a worker arrives to
paste up a poster on it As they walk a short distance

pulls him close

head of yours

DAN is generally roughing PYKE up and the others join

Suddenly a hand reaches out and helps her lift it free
from the barrel It is ADDY At first she is shocked
She then speaks in Sioux

HENQUAY
Hanyi ha cha ne ma

ADDY just looks at her puzzled as he assists her with
the heavy bucket HENQUAY herself looks puzzled as she
tugs the bucket away from ADDY

HENQUAY (CONTD)

Hanyi ho la ma

ADDY simply shakes his head from side to side HENQUAY
is realising that ADDY does not understand or cannot
communicate She holds out the bucket to him ADDY
smiles and takes it from her HENQUAY then walks away
ADDY follows her struggling with the full bucket
HENQUAY looks back She is puzzled that ADDY is still
following her She clearly believes ADDY wanted the
bucket for himself There is confusion HENQUAY moves
her arms in a shooing fashion

HENQUAY (CONTD)

ADDY stands and looks dumbstruck HENQUAY moves forward
and gently pushes ADDY back She points at the bucket
and gestures for him to take it away He begins to
understand that there has been a misunderstanding ADDY
smiles and steps forward and holds out the bucket to
her HENQUAY looks mystified ADDY steps forward and
places the bucket at her feet He smiles at her
HENQUAY looks down at the bucket and rolls her eyes in
despair She bends down and picks up the bucket and as
she stands upright ADDY places his hand on the bucket
also

HENQUAY (CONTD)
Ho Ma ma caho

She pulls on it a little but ADDY holds tight and

himself a cigarette and does not see this strange

nervously inside are the TWO WOMEN Opposite them is a

grizzly apparition that is TEXAS JACK They smile at
him nervously letting out little stifled yelps as the
Stage bounces along and they try to keep seated The
TWO WOMEN are desperately trying to hold onto their
decorum JACK who is chewing tobacco leans forward and
spits some out of the window A small amount of which
lands on WOMAN ONE Jack apologises and taking of his
bandana innocently wipes the chest of WOMAN ONE who
is very uncomfortable indeed

The Stage begins to pick up speed Entering the arena
are a gang of Indians led by JOE ELK Just behind him
is PAHA complete with war lance He is whooping along
with the other Indians in the group

The man riding shotgun on the Stage spots the Indians
chasing He turns and begins shooting

Inside the Stage the TWO WOMEN jump out of their skins
at each shot made worse still when TEXAS JACK begins
shooting out of the window with his pistol The TWO
WOMEN are terrified and find themselves in some very
undignified positions

JOE ELK shoots his rifle and the MAN riding shotgun
falls off the Stage TEXAS JACK drops his empty pistol
picks up his shotgun and as he climbs out is shot off
the Stage The TWO WOMEN scream as JOE ELK rides by the
window of the Stage and leaps off his horse onto the
side JOE ELK stands on the window ledge By now fully
convinced they are in danger WOMAN ONE picks up TEXAS
JACKs gun from the floor and begins hitting JOE ELK on
the foot with it JOE ELK lets out a yelp of pain and
looks at the TWO WOMEN before he climbs onto the roof
He throws off the driver as the TWO WOMEN inside
scream Then in rides the hero JOHNNY BAKER who chases
the Stage Catching up with it he leaps off his horse
JOE ELK and JOHNNY BAKER grapple on the roof until
JOHNNY BAKER lands JOE ELK a pretend right hook and JOE
ELK falls from the Stage

The audience including the KING are thrilled and
applaud enthusiastically as JOHNNY BAKER takes the
reins and pulls the Stage to a stop JOHNNY BAKER leaps
off the Stage and opens the door The TWO WOMEN now
blackened by gunpowder smoke and thoroughly
dishevelled shakily disembark taking in turn the hand
of JOHNNY BAKER who politely tips his hat to each

themselves to smile and to wave to the cheering crowd

curtsey to him

happy as he could ever be Suddenly a distinctive face
in the crowd flashes past and his expression changes

on the face is of none other than SAM PRICE ADDY has
seen his own father in the audience looking directly
at him but not seeming to recognize him ADDYs heart
is racing He drops the bow onto the roof of the
Deadwood Stage and stands up on the roof Now it is
just a sea of faces that flash past ADDYs mouth opens
and closes like a fish as he tries to muster the voice
to speak Then there is the face again ADDY leaps
onto the top of the Stage and shouts to the man

HENQUAY runs to join the WOMAN ADDY watches as they
walk past him HENQUAY looks back at ADDY and smiles
The WOMAN places her hand on HENQUAYs head and turns
it to face the front ADDY smiles to himself and
continues walking

HENQUAYs words have further exasperated ADDY He is
now deep in thought Confused and anxious ADDY
continues to search the showground looking at the faces
of the visitors who all continue to pat him on the
shoulder admiringly Finally he turns the corner of a
corral and is brought to an abrupt stop by the wooden
crutch of a one legged man in the crowd The man is
lighting a cigarette and acting in temper instinctively
pushes the boy away

SAM PRICE
Watch ya step ya little savage

ADDY looks up at the man to apologize His breath is
taken away as he sees standing before him his father
SAM PRICE clearly does not recognize the boy He laughs
at this little Indian boy attracting the attention of
the woman on his arm

The girl draped over SAM giggles

ADDY is breathless SAM PRICE shoves ADDY aside again
and continues on his way ADDY is dumbstruck as SAM
walks away ADDY does not know whether to call him or
not Stammering over his words the trembling boy
finally calls out

ADDY

Dddad

SAM continues walking for a few feet and then stops in
his tracks SAM turns and for a while looks at ADDY
There is no sign of any emotion on the face of SAM SAM
steps forward to take a closer look ADDY slowly begins
to smile SAM remains emotionless and without any sign
of recognition on his face awkwardly shuffles even
closer ADDYs smile fades as SAM turns away and begins
to walk towards his girlfriend who is staring with a
puzzled look at ADDY Tears begin to well up in ADDYs
eyes but gulping air he fights them off ADDY turns
Directly in front of him and only a few feet away
stands JOE who has clearly seen the whole thing ADDY
is being very brave JOE tenderly pulls the boy away

of our homes

go but is clearly deep in thought now

BILL (CONTD)

smile right now

As the coach rounds a bend and leaves the tree-lined
avenue a spectacular WINDSOR CASTLE greets their view

CUT TO

EXT WINDSOR CASTLE DRIVE EARLY EVENING

As the ornate carriage pulls up in front of a house an
army of scarlet-liveried men in white wigs rush to open
the doors They hold out their hands to assist the
occupants to step out A displaying peacock struts
past much to the amazement of the group LORD PONSENBY
steps forward holding out his hand He shakes
everyones hands enthusiastically

LORD PONSENBY
Welcome everyone His Majesty the
King is in the grounds and I am to
take you to him directly Food will
be served on the terrace Please do

Majesty was most impressed with his
skills

BILL
Yes Sir Hes our star attraction

The group follow their host across the front of the
house JOE and ADDY both look at the house

ADDY
Hes got a lot of rooms

JOE just nods at ADDY

Around the back of the house a large well laid out
garden is spread in front of them More peacocks strut
around At the far end of the grounds are a number of
canopies and a large group of people milling around
including a number of children dressed like china
dolls

LORD
Your Majesty may I present Colonel
Buffalo Bill Cody and his party

KING
Excellent Welcome Colonel

BILL
Oh Bill please Your Majesty May

KING kisses her hand

finery

of our guests and a smattering of

The KING leans over to ANNIE and says to her alone

THE KING (CONTD)
Some of us grown ups are pretty
excited too

ANNIE laughs politely
CUT TO
EXT WINDSOR CASTLE WALL EARLY EVENING

A small ornamental wall edging the terrace around the
house has become a seat for ADDY JOE and JOHNNY as
BILL and ANNIE prepare for a shooting match Clay
pigeons are brought rather ridiculously on silver
trays Another small group of servants hold out trays
with selections of tiny sandwiches to the group sitting
on the wall Each take something JOE tries to eat one
tiny sandwich and in the end puts all those in his hand
together to get a decent bite going JOHNNY cant help
but snigger at the pomp

EXT WINDSOR CASTLE SHOOTING RANGE EARLY EVENING

ANNIE loads up her Winchester rifle as the KING
inspects the barrel of his shotgun BILL stands by LORD
PONSENBY As the shooting party get ready the children
and other guests are moved back to safety behind them
The targets are set and the match gets underway Both
ANNIE and the KING are excellent shots BILL yawns a
little BILL is slowly falling asleep with utter
boredom JOHNNY taps BILL on the heel to wake him BILL
looks at JOHNNY and then takes out his pocket watch
BILL opens it and looks at the time

CUT TO
EXT WINDSOR CASTLE TERRACE DAY
The group are all there eating and drinking on the

the best of the KINGs whisky and smoking a fine cigar

KING

Colonel Cody

BILL
Thats very generous of ya Your
Majesty very generous indeed

ADDY sits listening to everything and looking at
peoples chins The KING turns to ADDY

KING
The boy with the remarkable bow
skill

JOE glances at BILL and then nods in agreement to the
KING

KING (CONTD)
I have learned just a little of
your language for this occasion

He bends down to ADDY as the rest of BUFFALO BILLS
party shuffle a little

KING (CONTD)
ErTaha ce na le ce pah how
(It is good to meet you)

ADDY looks at the KING as BILL holds his breath ADDY
responds with the only words he can remember

ADDY
Hanyi ho la ma
(Give me that bucket idiot
boy)

ADDY looks at JOE who rolls his eyes at ADDYs
response The KING not understanding the reply smiles
pretending that he did and laughs They all laugh
BILL laughs the loudest Perhaps a little too loud

KING
Excellent Perhaps we could take a
closer look at that bow of yours

ADDY takes the bow from his shoulder and passes it to
the KING His nerves get the better of him and his
repeating actions take a hold Passing the bow back and
forth The King thinking it is perhaps a strange Indian
ritual simply laughs as do the others BILL however
looks at JOE with a puzzled expression The KING
inspects it

THE KING
You know Colonel they have a
remarkable similarity to the
African Bushmans bow Quite
remarkable We have a bow of our

own from the African Wars very
similar to this You certainly are
a very talented little brave

The whole group laugh

THE KING (CONTD)
We do hope that you will stay for
the Ball this evening We have
insisted that the whole affair is
in your honour Colonel

BILL
With an invitation like that how
could I refuse Your Majesty

THE KING
Top Hole

BILL
Top Hole Your Majesty

All his group look at BILL shocked by his sudden
Englishness

The KING turns to ANNIE

THE KING
Miss Oakley We do hope that you
will join us for a polka this
evening

ANNIE
You bring the cards Your Majesty
and Ill bring the Whisky

There is an awkward moment but the KING sees this is a
cute Americanism and laughs heartily much to
everyones relief

THE KING
What a pity you are leaving the
capital Where are you going

BILL
To a place in the North

THE KING
We are sure that you will receive
the very best of welcomes Now
rooms have been prepared for you to
rest

The KING stands and all stand As the KING leaves all
bow or curtsey as best they can The men in scarlet
begin to usher the whole group inside When they are on
their own BILL turns to ANNIE

BILL
You bring the cards Your Majesty
and Ill bring the Whisky

ANNIE just smiles at BILL

ANNIE
Top Hole Bill

BILL looks at ADDY following behind and he turns to
JOE

BILL
Dont let that kid outa your sight
for one second

BILL leaning into JOE

BILL (CONTD)
What is it with all that repeating
stuff Joe

CUT TO
INT WINDSOR CASTLE BEDROOM EVENING

A fine panelled door opens to reveal a scarlet liveried
servant and standing behind him on his own is ADDY

As the door shuts ADDY for the first time takes in the
sheer opulence of the bedroom and it takes his breath
away He leans back on the door and drops his bow ADDY
moves cautiously into the massive bedroom There is a
large four-poster bed a massive fire place and very
expensive looking furniture He walks around looking at
things he has never seen before He takes an apple and
polishing it on his shirt takes a bite He munches
noisily on it as he wanders to the window and looks out
across the sculptured grounds Not knowing where to put
his apple core he looks under the bed Nothing - and
then seeing a very expensive looking Chinese vase he
places the apple core inside it He walks to the door
and opens it He does this three times before he steps
out into the long passage

INT WINDSOR CASTLE PASSAGE EVENING

ADDY walks along the passage looking at the paintings
on the wall Suddenly a door opens and he steps back
It is JOE JOE is also munching on an apple

JOE
Nice room

ADDY
Yeah

The two walk slowly down the hall

ADDY (CONTD)

Whats a Ball

JOE
Dont know but we find out soon

Side by side JOE and ADDY continue down the long
corridor looking at the paintings Another door opens
and this time it is BILL eating a bunch of grapes

BILL
A place like this reminds me how
long I been on tour

BILL joins them and the three walk down the corridor

BILL (CONTD)
When I get back Im going to open a
hotel and let the people of Cody
see how a King lives

The three continue down the corridor looking at the
paintings like three displaced persons They turn right
at the bottom of the corridor the camera remaining on
the scene a few seconds until the three walk back the
other way followed by two men in scarlet carrying
silver trays

CUT TO
INT WINDSOR CASTLE BANQUET HALL EVENING

A full orchestra strikes up some classical piece as the
large banquet hall slowly fills with richly dressed
people A man in a blue velvet suit and white wig is
announcing people as they enter the Ballroom In the
line is BILL JOHNNY ADDY and JOE ELK in the same
clothes they have been wearing all day The other
guests are as refined as they could be Military
uniforms on many of the men and the women dressed
resplendently in ball gowns A number of heavy
chandeliers light up the centre of the hall

ANNOUNCER
Lord Pendelton and Lady Pendleton
of Hartlebury

(Pause

(ANNOUNCER (CONTD)
General Fotheringay and Lady
Fotheringay of Glenthorn

It is the turn of BILL and the rest They stand not
knowing what to expect BILL leans over to the man and
whispers

ANNOUNCER (CONTD)
Colonel William Buffalo Bill Cody

As BILL walks past the announcer and down the stairs
the whole Ballroom stops and bursts into a rapturous

applause This pleases BILL and with a big beaming
smile he sweeps off his hat

ANNOUNCER (CONTD)
Johnny Baker - Chief Joe Elk - and
Kuku

There is so much warmth and the welcome for ADDY is
nothing short of adoration Every woman wants to mother
ADDY and every man admires the trio as they descend the
stairs

The group reach the ballroom floor and many people
gather to meet and to talk with them JOE remains stern
faced and many women gaze at him in a strange mixture
of adoration and fear ADDYs eyes are everywhere as
people pat him on the back and touch his long hair and
the feathers woven into it The groups attention is
drawn to the ANNOUNCER when he calls

ANNOUNCER (CONTD)
Miss Annie Oakley

BILL and the others look and gasp as ANNIE enters
looking absolutely beautiful wearing a long ball gown
and showing ample cleavage ANNIE is having some
difficulty walking down the stairs Many people applaud
her as slightly embarrassed she smiles and waves at
them BILL and JOHNNY rush to assist ANNIE Removing
their hats they stand each side of her linking their
arms with hers to escort her down the stairs both
concentrating rather too much on ANNIEs cleavage

BILL
Annie you look so lovely

ANNIE
Why thank you Bill This damned
corset is cutting off my
circulation so be ready to catch me
when I pass out

Obviously in their ears she has said pop out and both
BILL and JOHNNY step forward and say simultaneously

BILL AND JOHNNY

Ill catch ya Annie

BILL and JOHNNY look at each other

ADDY
You look just like a princess
Annie

ANNIE
Thank you

Everyones attention is drawn to the ANNOUNCER and the
room goes silent

ANNOUNCER
His Majesty the King

The KING enters the Ballroom in his finery and people
bow and curtsey as the KING passes The KING
acknowledges everyone and stops to chat with them en
route Finally talking to BILL and the others

ADDY wanders off and out of some large open doors onto
a terrace Many people have moved out onto the terrace
and are admiring the sunset that is casting a deep red
colour on the lovely grounds of Windsor Everyone
smiles and nods at the strange little Indian boy ADDY
finds it a little intimidating as he is not used to
such attention

ADDY walks through the sea of people until he comes
face to face with a one legged man in a uniform ADDYs
breath is taken away and he slowly raises his head in
expectation The man is not his father but a
distinguished old military gentleman very similar in
appearance

ADDY is a little frightened and all the memories of his
experience earlier in the day are flooding back ADDY
gently pushes his way through the thickening crowd and
finally he leaps over the low balcony wall and onto the
lawn below The haunting cry of a peacock makes ADDYs
heart beat a little faster and he finds himself
trotting along the edge of the building away from the
ball

Suddenly he is stopped in his tracks by a voice

JOE
Where are you running to

Looking back ADDY sees JOE standing on the lawn behind
him JOEs smile comforts ADDY and as JOE reaches the
boy he places his hand affectionately on ADDYs
shoulder

CUT TO
INT WINDSOR CASTLE BANQUET HALL EVENING

BILL and the JOHNNY are standing and watching ANNIE
dance a Polka (as best as she can) with the KING It is
a joyous affair and the KING is really enjoying
himself ANNIE is a little less enthusiastic although
she smiles a great deal She catches BILLs eye and
gives him that get us out of here look Bill simply
smiles

EXT EDGE OF LAKE IN GROUNDS EVENING
ADDY sits on a fallen tree at the edge of a lake

JOE
At home is a lake of such size that
the other side cannot be seen My
father told me that dangerous
spirits lived on the other side
That they would eat little boys if
they ventured to cross it

JOE looks at ADDY

ADDY
My Dad would tell me the bogey man
would get me if I was bad I
suppose thats the same thing I
think me Dad was the bogey man
though He was the scariest thing
in the house

JOE is edgy but says

JOE
Bill will make you go home I have
no power to stop him

ADDY

Im not going back Joe I dont
want to go back I want to stay
with you

JOE
We do not know if the show will
carry on after this Bill is old
now and there is talk of him
selling it

JOE is feeling rather awkward

ADDY

I shouldnt be made to go back if I
dont want to Me Dad left home to
fight at the start of the war He
couldnt wait to get away Hed

stay Granddad dont want me there
and I dont wanna be with him He

JOE

JOE mimicss the actions of ADDY with the bow and the
KING

JOE (CONTD)

ADDY

leave the show So I do it When
Im here with you its not as bad
as it was When me Mum was alive me
Dad used to blame her Hed wallop
her to make me stop I ask ya How

doing something when even I dont
know why I do it

ADDY stands and picks up stones to throw into

water

ADDY (CONTD)
I hate him now I should have hated
him then He didnt care about me

JOE
We are each given our path in life
In this grand place the white
father lives his life Outside the
gates people live a different life
but that is their path I dont
know what our path will be when we
return Once we were great and
lived in our world like this king
Its gone now and I dont know what
our world will be

ADDY
I know what my path will be if I
stay Id sooner take my chances
with you You told me about life
being like a circle There is
nothing in the rules that says a
circle cant be broken My Dad
broke his circle an I can break
mine

JOE thinks about ADDYs wise words

JOE
But Bill wont break his

ADDY
He wont if we dont try to make
himwill you try Joe

the

JOE is speechless He remains silent for a while
thinking JOE stands and begins to walk along the lake

side

ADDY stands and follows him

his chair ANNIE and JOE cannot believe they have lost
the argument

BILL (CONTD)
The kid goes home and thats it

JOE ANNIE and JOHNNY all look at ADDY who is clearly
upset As they near his home town ADDY looks out of the
window at the terrible industrial views outside

CUT TO
EXT STATION DAY
BILL steps out onto the platform amid the steam being

released from the train He looks around at the gloomy
vista
BILL
My God This place is hell on
earth

As the steam clears BILL is horrified to see that
clearly within ear shot a number of people are waiting
at the station Among them are local PRESS PEOPLE the
MAYOR in his gold chain of office and several
dignitaries They rush forward

MAYOR
Colonel Cody We welcome you

BILL goes into action and hoping that what he just
said was not heard BILL steps forward and firmly
shakes the MAYOR by the hand

BILL
I am obliged Sir I have heard
great things about your lovely town
and I am looking forward to seeing
it

Even the MAYOR is a little puzzled by this one

BILL (CONTD)
I have brought you 800 of the
finest fighting men the world has
ever seen Everything in my show is
100 percent

Suddenly everyones attention is drawn from BILL who
stops in mid sentence as the people move past him BILL
turns to see ADDY stepping from the train and behind
him is JOE JOE looks at BILL BILL is not happy

PRESS MAN ONE
Kuku I presume

BILL shouts as JOE answers

BILL JOE

BILL glares at JOE

PRESS MAN ONE
We have been waiting to meet this
boy How does it feel to be the
youngest member of the most famous
show on earth

ADDY looks back at JOE as

PRESS MAN TWO
We were told you were saved from
drowning by some fishermen This is
nothing short of a miracle Chief
you must be very grateful to them

JOE
I am

BILL feels captured by his own fame and publicity

PRESS MAN ONE

How does it feel son This is the
last show of the tour How much are
you looking forward to going home

ADDY gets a little agitated Especially as he looks
beyond the crowd and sees a group of youths standing on
the slope the other side of the iron railings Among
them is none other than the bald JONUS PYKE ADDY does
not know what to do as the press and the MAYOR push to
talk to him BILL steps in

BILL
The boy does not speak English
Hes as genuine as I am Everything
in Buffalo Bills Wild West is 100
genuine

ANNIE and JOE look at each other BILL has backed
himself into a corner again

ADDY is hiding his face from PYKE as best he can He
cannot resist another look As he does so to his horror
PYKE is looking directly at ADDY Fortunately a hiss of
steam is driven between them ADDY does not know if
PYKE recognized him ADDY steps down into the crowd and
out of view of the Youths There is a flash and a
camera captures the gathering which includes the MAYOR
BILL ADDY

BILL takes JOE to one side

BILL (CONTD)
The kid can stay here to meet any
more newspaper men until we leave
Then he goes home Paha does the
act The kid stays in your lodge
out of sight

CUT TO
EXT NORTH SHOWGROUND DAY

Rehearsals are underway in the arena The Russian
Cossacks are doing incredible stunts on horseback while
the horses run at full speed around the outside of the
arena The canopies are still being erected by a
mixture of show people and the locally hired crew The
local crew are working but also very interested in what
is happening in the arena At the ring side stands DAN
BASH and TODDY They are smoking a cigarette and
watching the show BASH is looking around trying to get
a feel for the place WILLIAM PRINNEY walks around the

outside of the arena towards the three Upon reaching
them He asks

PRINNEY

BASH

PRINNEY shakes hands with all three

PRINNEY
This has to be quick lads The old
man will be dressing soon for the

his red sash on the front pole so
your lad will know which one it is
At the back of the tent I will put
some bales of hay This will shield
your boy while he does the job Is
he bright

DAN laughs

PRINNEY (CONTD)
I cant stress enough lads that if
this goes wrong Ill be in deep
trouble and if Im in deep trouble
you boys will be in deeper trouble
If Im relying on a lad what cant
cut it my friends in the South
wont be happy one bit These guys
are fencing the jewellery and they
have buyers who are relying on this
deal Any hint of a double cross
and theyll not think twice about
paying you fellows a visit Do you
understand what I am saying

BASH
Hell do the job dont worry about
him You just make sure that what
we need is in the right place

PRINNEY
I hope so Where does laughing boy
come into this

DAN is not happy at all being called laughing boy and
his flash temper gets the better of him He rushes at
PRINNEY and grabs him around the throat

DAN
Listen London you just do your job
in this or Im the deep trouble you
got to worry about first
BASH
Stay calm fellahs This is not the
time or the place There is a lot
of money at stake Enough for all

Staying calm is important

DAN puts PRINNEY down PRINNEY looks around and
straightens his clothes

PRINNEY
Wheres the boy your using I told
you I wanted to see him

BASH
Hes here

Walking along the bottom row of seats walking with one
leg on the floor and moving up and down as he walks is
the bald headed JONUS PYKE looking every inch a
complete idiot

PRINNEY
Thats him Hes the best you could
find

DAN

He will do the job Hes only got
to cut a bit o canvas and grab a
box A monkey could do that

At this time PYKE arrives and is scratching a scab on
his bald head picking it off and then looking at it in
a very monkey like way

PRINNEY
Just as well by the look of
things

PYKE
Waah

CUT TO
INT LODGE DAY

ADDY sits inside the lodge packing a few of the gifts
he has received ADDY is once again dressed in his own
clothes He taps at the canvas bag and is feeling very
sad and very frightened PAHA enters the lodge PAHA
stops when he sees ADDY sitting there PAHA reaches for
his own bow and quiver He looks at ADDY who totally
ignores him

ADDY stands as does PAHA PAHA puffs himself up

PAHA
You are not a Sioux

ADDY
Whats ya point Paha I know Im

arse and show them you love them
instead of moping around the place

PAHA holds in his anger and begins to walk out

ADDY (CONTD)
(under his breath)

I just wanted a little bit of what
youve got thats all

Unseen by ADDY PAHA stops and for a second watches ADDY
ritualistically tapping at his belongings before he
lifts them

ADDY

ADDY is clearly distressed at this and as the group
talk among themselves ADDY begins to walk away round
the back of the lodge HENQUAY follows him ADDY
realizes she is following him

ADDY (CONTD)

across the encampment

EXT YARD DAY

The picture on the gate of JONUS PYKE is a little
washed out now as ADDY slowly opens the gate He enters
slowly looking around DAN PRICEs workshop is all cold
and silent ADDY walks to the door of the house and
before going in he looks around Looking up at FLORRIE
HAMMONDs window The curtain remains still ADDY walks
into the house Nothing has changed but the house is
clearly empty ADDY slowly walks up the stairs taking
many backward steps en route Finally he enters his
bedroom

ADDY looks around for HETTIE She is not there and her
bed does not look slept in at all ADDY is beside
himself He looks out of the window down in the yard
She cannot be seen

ADDY begins to panic and only as he is about to close
the curtain does he catch a glimpse of HETTIEs Rag
dolly flying in the air in FLORRIE HAMMONDs yard ADDY
runs down the stairs and across the yard He opens the
gate to the next yard HETTIE is in the yard throwing
her doll in the air and catching it

ADDY

CUT TO
EXT SHOWGROUND DAY

JOE stands by the corral fence looking sad With him
stands ANNIE and JOHNNY

BILL arrives back in a very bad mood As he draws up a
couple of cowboys move in to help him off his horse
BILL will have none of it and kicks them out of the
way BILL slides off the horse and holding the reins

walks along to a hitching post BILL ties up his horse
JOHNNY walks up and BILL barks at him

BILL

BILL strides off towards his tent shouting

BILL (CONTD)
Prinney

PRINNEY is in BILLs tent and he steps out on hearing
BILLs voice

BILL (CONTD)
How come youre always in my tent

PRINNEY is thrown into utter panic and he stutters and
stammers

PRINNEY
But but

BILL goes to walk past him BILL stops and steps back

BILL
Just one thing

BILL right hooks PRINNEY sending him sprawling in the
dirt

BILL (CONTD)
Thats for stealing my Whisky

BILL enters his tent and kicks the table flying This
action is ill conceived as Bills bones suddenly remind
him of his age and BILL lets out a cry of pain BILL
bends holding his back BILL reaches out for a bottle
of Whisky and then looks around for a glass He cannot
find a glass so biting the cork out and spitting it
away BILL takes a big gulp from the bottle

Led by JOE the group enter

BILL (CONTD)

BILLs eyes fill up and he sits with his back to ANNIE
so that she cant see his face

BILL
Thats different

ANNIE
How is it different

BILL

It just is Look Annie Joes an
Indian I know hed be a good
father to the boy but this kids a
white boy and an English boy Joe
cant just pick another son because
he lost one Annie its every kids
dream to run away to the circus and

thats all it is What if we got
him thousands of miles away and he
decided he wanted home again Have
you thought of that I say for the
last time I stand on this issue
Annie and nothing not even a
strike is going to change my mind
The best thing that could happen is
for the kid to realize that he has
a home and to go to it

CUT TO
INT FLORRIES HOUSE DAY

HETTIE and ADDY sit at the table Though the room is
not big it is clean and there is a table cloth GEORGE
sits at the table also HETTIE looks at ADDY as FLORRIE
takes a cooking pot from the fire and begins to dish up
a large helping of white steamed offal It looks
disgusting as it wobbles and quivers onto the plate
HETTIE wrinkles up her nose at it ADDY swallows hard
at the thought of eating it

FLORRIE
Come on children eat heartily
Theres plenty more One thing we
dont scrimp on here is food
Always plenty to eat

ADDY toys with his food as it just wobbles back at him
He is about to take a mouthful when GEORGE speaks up
giving ADDY the chance to stall eating it

GEORGE
These Indians are savages arent
they

ADDY

No theyre not Theres Chief Joe
Mallini and their son Paha Joe is
nearest thing to a Dad Ive ever
had

FLORRIE steps in
FLORRIE
Enough talkeat At least you can
eat civilised food now youre home

ADDY takes a look at the food once more

Suddenly the gate begins to bang DAN PRICE can be
heard shouting

DAN
Bring that little brat out here I
know hes there hes been seen

ALL in the house look at each other FLORRIE rolls up
her sleeves

FLORRIE
I will deal with Dan Price

GEORGE stands and puts on some spectacles

FLORRIE (CONTD)
They are my glasses

GEORGE
Not for now theyre not He wont
hit a man in glasses

FLORRIE
Let me deal with Dan Price

GEORGE
No you wont Im the man of this
house and I am not afraid of him
FLORRIE looks at GEORGE in a new light

She smiles at him as he walks across the room and out
of the door

CUT TO
EXT GATE DAY

DAN PRICE is banging on the gate violently He stops
when he hears the bolt pulled back The gate opens DAN

begins to step forward GEORGE places himself in the
way

GEORGE
Going somewhere Dan

DAN
Get out the way George I want me
grandson

GEORGE is nervous but he holds his ground
GEORGE
An Englishmans home is his castle
Dan Price

DAN
Dont be bloody silly

GEORGE tries hard to stop DAN but DAN is clearly a
bigger man DAN grabs GEORGE by the scruff of his neck

GEORGE
You cant hit a man in glasses

DAN holding GEORGE with one hand removes GEORGEs
glasses from his face with the other He pushes GEORGE
to the floor and walks straight over his spectacles
crushing them under foot

DAN begins to walk across the yard to the house

DAN
Where did you sell my watch you
thieving little sod

INT FLORRIES HOUSEDAY

FLORRIE sees this and grabbing her biggest frying pan
moves towards the door

ADDY
I will be back Hettie

ADDY runs to the front door opens it and runs into
the narrow alley at the front of the house ADDY runs
towards the end Almost at the end he is suddenly
confronted by JONUS PYKE who is as surprised to see
ADDY as ADDY is to see him In a second ADDY lands PYKE
a right hook across the jaw Flooring PYKE ADDY steps
over him and runs out of sight

CUT TO
EXT SHOWGROUND DAY

BILL on his horse is once again holding court in the
centre of the arena The whole show has gathered BILL

ever the showman nods his head solemnly and takes off
his hat in a gesture to the assembly

BILL
Friends I know you all meant well
in the situation with the boy and
that only makes me respect you
more but I have had to set
standards over the years and well
just because its all ending there
is no reason to let things fall
apart The boy has gone home which
was the right thing to do and it
was his decision alone and come
rain or shine the show has to go
on

BILL begins to ride around a little looking at the
faces of his people more directly

BILL (CONTD)
Congress this is the last
performance in Europe and this
afternoon I will be out here doing
what I can to fulfil the mission we
set out with

BILL looks over at JOHNNY ANNIE and JOE who all stand
together

JOE walks away from the group ANNIE watches him go
with sadness in her eyes BILL can see that there is no
great enthusiasm for him right now So he tries a
different tack

BILL (CONTD)
This show is about you folk Its
never been about Buffalo Bill Its
the Congress of Rough Riders The
most spectacular event on earth
Listen just take a second to
listen to this place

Everyone goes silent to listen to the thousands of
steam hammers and the din of factory toil

BILL (CONTD)
Listen to that You know what that
sound is saying to me Its saying
we have been to the most exotic
places on this earth with this
show We have truly been blessed
with good fortune This place is
full of good people hard working
people the kind of people who were
our forefathers The very same
people who built the West and gave
us our God given right to be proud
They have a right to see us in all
our bright glory

BILL takes down his tempo in a crafted manner

BILL (CONTD)
Folks this is the moment that the
light dims and an old man takes his
final bow It is fitting that the
people who have given so much and
stood by him through all times both
good and bad stand by him now
(pause)as the sun sets upon his
final hour

BILLs horse bows its front legs As it once again
stands upright BILL slowly places his hat back on his
head He turns his horse to walk out of the arena
There are actually tears in the eyes of many of his
(easily duped) team JOHNNY begins applauding and the
whole team begin to join in until eventually thunderous
applause and whistles echo around the arena BILL still
keeping his face solemn slowly rides off stage Another
triumph for a great man

CUT TO

EXT STABLES DAY

JOE is gathering blankets and placing them over a
corral post ANNIE walks up to him as the sound of the
applause still echoes around the showground

ANNIE
Sounds like the old man did it
again Ya gotta give it to him
(pause) Have you made your peace
with Paha

JOE
Yes Paha is happy now the boy has
gone

ANNIE
And you

JOE

Im happy that my son has found
peace now Also he has a place in
the show It is all he has wanted

ANNIE
Thats not what I meant

JOE
The boy went home What else is
there Mallini is happy Paha is
happy and Bill is happy Why should

I be sad

ANNIE
‘cus the boy meant something to
you

JOE stops what he is doing

JOE
Bill did not see what I saw I felt
that I had been sent a sign and
that he was my son returned I
wanted to believe Annie Maybe I
was wrong I was foolish to believe
that the gods would be so generous
to someone who has abandoned his
own people to make this tour Addy
is not my son I understand now
and soon I will be back with my
people

ANNIE pats JOE on the back and walks away JOE carries
on with his job

CUT TO
INT ADDYS HOUSE

DAN is more sober His head is wet and he has clearly
been trying to sober himself up In the room is JONUS

PYKE and BASH DAN is holding a copy of the flyer in
his hand He screws it up into a ball and throws it
into the fire

DAN
You have got to be joking Call it
off for Gods sake Its gone
Without that Prinney

BASH
Its not gone Dan Think what it
means to you To all of us It just
means a change of plan

DAN
Its suicide ya mad devils

BASH
Your Addy has proven hes a thief
Dan Look at the watch He knew how
much that meant to you Pyke says
he saw him dressed as an Indian at
the station He can get in and out
the showground without any problem

PYKE
I know where hell be

DAN
Youre an idiot I wouldnt believe
you even if I saw it myself and you
then told me

BASH
Look Dan Prinney says it can be
done Hes willing to stick his
neck out for the job Whats to
lose

BASH moves close to DAN and out of ear shot of PYKE

BASH (CONTD)
So what if Pyke or your Addy get
caught No one can put the finger
on us can they And if they succeed
then were quids in

DAN
I dont even know where he is I
gave the little bugger a pasting
Hes probably miles away by now if
he knows whats good for him That
watch was all I had to remember me
lad by

BASH
Pyke says he knows where the lad
will be
DAN
It keeps coming back to Pyke Its
a sorry state when we have to rely
on that twit

PYKE is picking his nose

BASH

Why not Dan (pause) why not Look
if Pyke can find him hell put the
fear of God into the nipper Make
it so he cant refuse All we gotta
do is meet em afterwards If they
dont show We go down the pub like
we always do

DAN says nothing but he clearly is agreeing to it
CUT TO
EXT SHOWGROUND DAY

The showground is filling up A very different crowd
from London A few dignitaries including the MAYOR but
for the most part very poor looking people mostly
families

CUT TO
INT BILLS TENT

BILL is smoking a cigar JOHNNY is with him BILL is
very self satisfied He sits with a glass of whisky in
the same hand as his cigar

BILL
I would have done the whole damned
show on my own In a way Im sorry
Im not It would have been a
fitting epitaph for Buffalo Bill I
can out ride out rope and about
out shoot any man on this team if I
could just get me boots on

BILL gestures for JOHNNY to help him on with his long
black boots JOHNNY rolls his eyes a little but gets to
it as

Three men arrive two of them holding a strong box BILL
leaps to his feet leaving JOHNNY level with his nether
regions JOHNNY looks round

BILL (CONTD)
Bring it in boys Bring it in

One man gives BILL the key that he places in the lock
before they even have a chance to lay it on the table
The men then leave

BILL (CONTD)
Do you know what that is son

JOHNNY
Nope

BILL
Its my hotel Im gonna name it
after my daughter The Irma Hotel
No more investments This is mine
and this will work

JOHNNY
Bill This things eating me up
They all know how you treat me and
I do feel like your son I cant
look em in the face Least of all
Joe If it wasnt for you Id
probably have suffered the same
fate as Addy

BILL simply ignores JOHNNY and grabs his smaller jewel
box and opens the large box placing his personal
valuables inside the large chest

BILL locks it and places the key inside another pair of
boots under the table BILL throws a small blanket over
the chest and then sits so that JOHNNY can complete his
task of putting on Bills boots

CUT TO
EXT CANAL DAY

ADDY sits near the mouth of a long tunnel This is a
remote part of the canal and he feels that it is the
only place he can be safe His face is very bruised and
his lip split and sore ADDY opens his bag and takes
out a flyer with his picture on it He looks at it for
a while Then he picks up a stone ADDY wraps the flyer
around the stone and throws it into the canal ADDY
takes his bag comic book and his arrows and he throws
them into the canal They drift off into the tunnel
Then he lifts his bow and throws that into the canal
The bow floats off into the darkness

ADDY sits very sad indeed Nowhere to go and no one to
see Then the water in front of him ripples as a stone
is thrown into it ADDY looks around to see where it is
coming from Another stone hits the water ADDY has a
frozen look of fear on his face as skidding down the
stony canal bank is JONUS PYKE followed by a gang of
his equally rough looking youths One slides a little
too far and falls directly into the canal While PYKE
concentrates on ADDY the others laughing help the
youth out of the water

PYKE

PYKE is a

Now how did I know you would be
here Just clever as hell I am

ADDY
What do you want Pyke

little shocked that ADDY spoke to him

PYKE
How come you never spoke before

ADDY
I asked you what you want Im not
frightened of you If you come
closer Ill box your ears for you

PYKEs gang all laugh Though PYKE also laughs mixed
with a bit of bravado he still is not stupid enough to
move forward He still has a split lip from ADDYs last
right hook

PYKE
I got something you might want You
aint got nowhere to go have you
You could be all nicely tucked up
in your own bed at your granddads
If you had this

PYKE takes out the watch from his pocket and holds it
in front of ADDY ADDY is clearly disturbed by this

ADDY does

ADDY
Where did you get that

PYKE

It dont matter I just got it
aint I Now if you want a home
back so you dont have to sit here
for the rest of your life This is
all your Granddad wants He thinks
you stole it and sold it Oh hell
be mad at you More as like give
you another slapping but if he has
this back hell forgive you (pause)
eventually Tempting aint it

not budge

PYKE (CONTD)
Suit yourself Now if you want this
back there is a little job you have
to do for me first I gave you a
deadline before and you didnt
show Now you get a second chance
The showground is gonna be open
after the show There will be a
million people saying goodbye to
Buffalo Bill so you go in all sweet
saying how youre happy at home now

and come to say all your goodbyes
Prinney told us how you bin sucking
up to them redskins You gotta get
inside Buffalo Bills tent and set
the strong box on the floor at the
back Thats all and then you get
this back

ADDY is horrified by the suggestion

ADDY
I cant do it

PYKE
OK thats alright then Ill just
sell it They think you nicked it
anyway Hope it dont get too cold
out here Theres all kind of
things can happen in the dark
Another little splash and no one
will ever know you didnt just
drown yourself

PYKE begins to walk off

ADDY
Wait

EXT ARENA DAY

In the arena the Deadwood Stage is circling PAHA is
seated on the top and JOE follows the stage around on
his horse The MEN stand ready to throw the glass
balls BILL stands with one foot on the lower beam
leaning against the outer fence watching As the Stage
circles

DRIVER
Ready son

PAHA breathing heavily prepares himself The balls are
thrown into the air and PAHA manages to get off two
shots but both go way off target JOE looks very
disappointed for the boy

PAHA
Again

The DRIVER lashes the horses to go around again and
taking deep breaths PAHA prepares himself again JOE
does not take his eyes of his son The balls are once
again thrown and PAHA gets off two shots but only one
shatters the ball PAHA screams with utter frustration
The DRIVER pulls up and PAHA leaps off and walks
angrily across the arena JOE spurs his horse towards
the boy

JOE

son

JOE
Different to you that is all Just
different You are my son Paha I
was lost in my grief for Kuku I am
ashamed that my heart was placing
blame I was wrong (pause) I am so
proud of you

PAHA looks at his father Joe Elk at first looks ahead
and then turns to his son

JOE (CONTD)
-and I love you with all my
heart

JOE puts his arm around PAHA and pulls him close to
him JOE places his other hand on PAHAs head and pulls
him into him

BILL is marching towards the arena his face like
thunder but on seeing the scene on the benches he
stops in his tracks and we see for a fleeting second
a different and more compassionate BUFFALO BILL BILL
turns and walks the other way

CUT TO

EXT SHOWGROUND NIGHT

The whole showground is lit up with large electric
lights There are campfires lanterns and torches The
flashes of red in the sky as the relentless industry
continues provide a scene like an inferno The
AUDIENCE are gathering A less than smartly dressed
crowd Much less opulent than the London people
Shabbily dressed families Kids without shoes Hard
looking men The band plays as the crowds gather The
MAYOR himself standing apart from the crowd with his
small group of dignitaries Also in the crowd are
BILLs investors with their wives

CUT TO
EXT BACKSTAGE NIGHT

The show people are putting on their finest show
costumes for BILLs big finale Horses are being
groomed and made ready and saddles polished Blank
ammunition is being handed out to all who can carry a
weapon

BILL walks on his own gathering his thoughts He has no
clue how to handle this situation BILL stops and takes
out a cigar He lights it As the plume of smoke wisps
in front him BILL is not paying much attention to
things around him As the smoke clears he looks ahead
of him His eyes widen There in front of him as clear
as day on the fence is a white bird The bird takes
to the wing BILL watches it for a short period He
shakes the thought from his head and continues walking

JOHNNY walks up with a group of important looking men
BILL shakes their hands enthusiastically

CUT TO
EXT SHOWGROUND ENTRANCE NIGHT

ADDY mingles with the large throng of people filling
the showground He is followed a few yards back by
JONUS PYKE and his gang PYKE does not take his eyes
off ADDY ADDY is more than unhappy as he walks looking
up at the show posters On seeing the massive poster of
himself ADDY inhales the smells of the show like it is
the best perfume he has ever smelled

CUT TO
EXT BOX OFFICE NIGHT
ADDY is in line to buy his ticket He hands over the
few shillings given by PYKE to get him in The BOX
OFFICE ATTENDANT recognizes ADDY He is flustered and
excited
BOX OFFICE ATTENDANT

Kuku Dammit kid the Colonel will
be pleased to see you What the
hell happened to your face Wait
there

ADDY looks back at PYKE As the ATTENDANT leaves his
box ADDY ducks inside the showground and out of sight
PYKE smiles to himself The ATTENDANT looks for ADDY
who is nowhere to be found PYKE and his gang use the
opportunity to duck past and into the showground
without paying Once inside PYKE throws the change up a
few inches smiling at this minor triumph of getting in
without paying He places the money in his pocket

CUT TO
EXT SEATS NIGHT

BILL is settling his important guests into the best
seats close to the ANNOUNCER

EXT SHOWGROUND AREA NIGHT

ADDY sees faces he knows all over the place He avoids
them and hides where he has too

PYKE is having a hard job keeping up with ADDY He
mutters to himself

PYKE
What are you doing We want people
to see you Thats why youre here
Thick twit

For a time ADDY manages to lose PYKE and heads for the
Colonels tent ADDY gets to the inner circle and into
the private area He walks towards Bills tent He
almost jumps out of his skin when a hand is placed upon
his shoulder ADDY spins around to see HENQUAY standing
and smiling at him ADDY smiles a big smile He hugs
HENQUAY

point PYKE and his thugs appear and chase after ADDY
They are stopped dead in their tracks by a small group
of Indians riding past ADDY has disappeared

CUT TO
EXT CAMP NIGHT

HENQUAY turns between two tents and instantly she is
caught by PYKEs thugs HENQUAY kicks and screams One
of PYKEs thugs places his dirty hand over her mouth to
keep her quiet

PYKE
I saw you talking to Price so I

shrouded in blue smoke BILL sniffs the air taking in
the smell of black powder and cordite

BILL glances over to his guests who are clearly happy
with what they are experiencing They wave to him

CUT TO
INT STAGECOACH NIGHT

PYKE does not know what is going on and as the sound of
gunfire becomes deafening and smoke drifts into the

cowers This gives ADDY the chance he has been looking

for and he dives onto PYKE just as the stage pulls off
to enter the arena

CUT TO

AUDIENCE laugh BILL is not too happy and replies

BILL
It looks like we have our first
volunteer to be scalped folks

BILL lifts his hand and three Indians begin to ride in

The AUDIENCE laugh at BILLs retort but the YOUNG MAN
suddenly does not think himself so funny as the Indians
ride across the arena taking out their tomahawks and
knives

BILL raises his hand again and the Indians turn and
ride out again

BILL (CONTD)

appears a couple of Indians PYKE swiftly grabs his
head

CUT TO
INT CHAIN SHOP NIGHT

A large brooding building half factory half iron girder
lean to There are far more people hanging around than

others walk through the lean to towards the inner
factory DAN looks around really dumfounded

DAN

Florrie and George

BASH
There is plenty to go round and
things have changed a little Dan
We may need a little more
protection than we first thought

DAN
Protection From what

They enter the building Inside are even more people
holding pickaxe handles and chains including PYKEs
thugs Standing in a corner is PRINNEY He looks
utterly fed up Sitting silently on a pile of heavy
chains is HENQUAY On seeing the girl DAN puts his face
in his hands

DAN (CONTD)
Oh hell are you insane

Dan is clearly realizing he is dealing with a big
problem As the night shift whistle blows a man enters
from outside

MAN
Some riders coming But theyre
from the show Theres bloody
Indians

HENQUAY looks up hopefully

BASH
Wheres PYKE with the box I knew
we shouldnt have trusted him

DAN and BASH and PRINNEY exit the building A stockade
of hard men has been set up as the riders come close

BASH (CONTD)
Thats close enough

BILL
Bring the girl Now

BASH
Oi oi whoever you are You dont
dish your orders out here

BILL

BASH
The thing is Mr Bill or can I call

DAN grimaces at how stupid BASH sounds

BASH (CONTD)

As you can see your pretty well
outnumbered here and you got
something we want and we got
something you want Perhaps we can
do a trade

DAN looks at BASH

BILL

Like what

BASH
We sent one of ours to get the
money you got

BILL
And you want him back

BASH
Lord no you can keep him We just
want the money I mean

BASH points in the direction of HENQUAY

BASH (CONTD)
She must be worth a few bob to you

ADDY can wait no longer he slides from his horse loads
his bow and walks without fear towards BASH and DAN
Some of the men back off PAHA seeing this slides off
his pony and walks only inches behind ADDY to support
him

DAN
Addy (pause) If your dad hears
about this hell

ADDY
My Dad He’s not coming back here
He’s been back ages I seen him

DAN looks open mouthed at this

DAN
Thats not true

DAN looks around at Bash and the rest
There is a tear in his eye DAN is a broken
man

DAN

BASH is angry and he begins to walk forward
threateningly

BASH
Are you mad its not over by me by
a long chalk Youre messing with
the wrong one kid Your granddad
might be gutless but Im not

ADDY like lightening fires two arrows right into the
feet of BASH pining him to the wooden plank he is
standing on BASH looks more in shock than he is in
pain He falls backwards with the plank on which he was
standing firmly stuck to his feet ADDY moves past BASH
close to DAN and holds the arrow firmly at his head
There is a general look of horror on everyones face
including BILLs ADDY shakes as though all the hatred
he has is channeled into that one moment

DAN
Son Im your Granddad

BILL and JOE just sit tight as ADDY stands his ground
PAHA walks up to ADDY and gently places his hand on the
boys shoulder

ADDY
The girl Now
DAN
For Gods sake somebody bring the

girl out

DAN (CONTD)
Son I never meant for this Its
been hard for me since ya dad went
It had been twenty years since I

PRINNEY who can take no more steps in but stands
behind DAN to protect himself from ADDYs arrows BILL
looks angrily at PRINNEY

BILL
I should have known youd be behind

PRINNEY

I want you to know that you are the
meanest most arrogant big headed
son of a bitch I have ever known

BILL

BILL is deadly serious and whips out his gun cocks it
and to everyones shock points it at PRINNEY PAHA
looks back at BILL and smiles

BILL (CONTD)
Now get the girl before I lose my
temper

PRINNEY

Never stop do you Cant you see
youre outnumbered So send your
redskins back for the money and
well end this

A clap of thunder makes everyone jump Even Bills
horse has the jitters The thugs look nervously beyond
Bill to the black hills of coal slag behind him The
thunder continues all around as in a cloud of dust
the entire show silhouetted against the fire red sky
appear over the crest of the hill At the front ANNIE
rides next to JOHNNY who is still wearing Bills hair

BILLs chest fills with pride

Behind JOHNNY lying across the back of his horse is
PYKE bound hands and feet JOHNNY pushes PYKE off into
the coal dust

THUG
Bloody hell theyve scalped Pyke

The thug runs off followed by the rest who scatter and
run in every direction PYKEs thugs bring out HENQUAY
unharmed and seeing the massive show they along with
PRINNEY scatter also The only one left standing is
DAN ADDY firmly aiming the bow at his head JOE
dismounts And walks up behind ADDY

JOE
Let it go son

PAHA steps up also
PAHA

I too had an anger (but it
passedbrother

ADDY looks at PAHA and lowers his bow much to DANs
relief ADDY puts his hand in his pocket and takes out
the watch and holds it out to DAN DAN is shocked to
see it DAN silently takes it

ADDY
I never stole Dads watch Pyke ‘ad
it

DAN does not know what to say ADDY turns away from DAN

Not a word is said as ADDY walks over to HENQUAY DAN
turns to pick up BASH ADDY and HENQUAY walk to the
horses as JOE and PAHA mount up HENQUAY is helped up
behind BILL and ADDY behind JOE ADDY does not look
back at DAN as the horses turn and they all ride off
JOE turns and looks at DAN emotionless ADDY looks at
PYKE as they pass him on the slope PYKE hops around to
look at ADDY before losing his footing and falling
then rolling in the dust to the bottom of the hill As
he hits the bottom PYKE looks up to see all the riders

disappearing over the crest of the hill PYKE turns his
attention to DAN who is helping BASH up BASH is in
pain as they carry him away still with the board
attached to his feet PYKE struggles to get to his feet
and hops after them shouting

PYKE
Hang on Wait for me I need to get
untied Hang on

PYKE hops across the yard before falling over once
again

a sensitive subject She leans forward to say something
but clearly is too angry to find the words

The train begins to slowly move off BILL takes out his
watch opens it looks at the time and begins to wind
it

BILL (CONTD)
Now if a kid were to climb aboard

smile

EXT TRAIN EARLY MORNING

From outside and moving along with the train we see
BUFFALO BILL in profile utterly self satisfied drawing
deeply on his big cigar Below him written on the side
of the train in large letters is just the word CODY
The train moves swiftly away from the band of black
clouds and pounding hammers and as the image rises and
turns to face the direction of the train we see blue
sky and green rolling hills High above the train
glides the white bird soaring into the deep blue sky
announcing a bright future for ADDY
