A young boy SONNY STORM rushes out -- excited but pouty

at the curb -- then turns back toward the house

MASON STORM

emerges from the house -- wearing a dark Gianni Versace
sport coat with a black vest underneath carrying some
kind of case in his hand He looks great -- a man of
action not dandified at all by the snappy attire He
squints down toward Sonny proudly -- very much the family
man

Masons pretty wife FELICIA appears in the doorway

to the shadowed shack area

STORM (0S)
(to himself
softly)
I know you Calabrese But who are
these mystery guests

The two Shadow Men are obscured by the shack and the
position of Calabrese and Vitale

STORM

Starts his camera soundlessly whirring He positions his
high-tech directional mike slipping on earphones

WHARF - CONSPIRATORS

There is NOISE from various wharf MACHINERY on adjacent
piers but the high-tech listening equipment still brings

in the sound with acceptable clarity

CALABRESE
-- Murder is a serious business my
friend And an expensive one

THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS

Despite the shadows its plain the Man With The Hat is
in his prime full of vigor and impatience Calabrese
by contrast is clearly older more circumspect

CALABRESE
Slowly slowly Always with
caution

SHADOW MAN WITH HAT
Im up to here with caution That
fuck lives on bean curd and alfalfa
sprouts -- he aint gonna die of
natural causes

CALABRESE
All Im counseling is a little
patience The man is public Hes
in the paper every day

SHADOW MAN WITH HAT

about him it better be in the
obituaries

ON STORM

He squints over the camera straining to see with the
naked eve Frustration

ANGLE - CALABRESE AND VITALE

Glancing to each other Theyre tough guys but in some
hard-to-define way the two Shadow Men are tougher

BAREHEADED SHADOW MAN
Enough bullshit Can you do the

steps around one container (out of view of the other men)
to the exact spot where Storm was But Storm isnt there
Mikey is about to check farther when out of nowhere

Storm lashes out with a savage punch to the face The
blow is so devastating it knocks Mikeys feet out from
under him so that he topples face-forward into Storms
arms out cold Storm soundlessly lowers the lookout to
the ground

Storm shakes a sore hand and notices its cut Kneeling
down to the outstretched heap he finds the cause of his
injury -- one of Mikeys teeth wiggles freely in his
fingers Storm plucks the tooth and folds it inside the
big guys hand

He gestures to the register

COUNTER MAN

He scoops bills from the cash drawer (about twenty bucks)
shoves them to the Shotgun Punk The Punk scowls --

COUNTER MAN

The Punks dont know whether to laugh or just shoot him
but it is too late for either option as Storm suddenly
spins between the Punks and behind the gun

he SHOTGUN GOES OFF and BLOWS away part of the back WALL --
OTTLES EXPLODE -- Storm locks the Punks fingers into

he gun rotates the gun as a bar breaking the Punks

rm

otWH

he others make their move -- but now Storm has the shotgun
nd is using it as a sword or staff He looks like a

rue master conductor in an almost magical manipulation
hese pour stupid Punks have become the instruments in

his spontaneous orchestra

Hoes

Punk 2 takes a vicious swipe at Storm with his long knife
Storm ducks goes to his knees and uses the gun to foot-
sweep the Punk The Punks legs fly skyward and his head
slams against the floor As soon as he hits the shotgun

is slammed through his teeth

The last Punk has produced an icepick and is staring at
his compadres in disbelief He and Storm square off

STORM

(to Punk calmly)
I know what youre thinking I
have this big shotgun and all you
have is that little icepick Mines
bigger than yours Its not fair

Storm sets the gun down Punk 3 is still frozen
STORM

Still not fair
Storm gets down on his knees

ice pick tightly)
Chinga tu madre

The Punk lungs thrusting the ice pick with lightning
speed at Storms face

Storm makes a slight movement parries the thrust and
slides his body behind the Punk simultaneously slamming
his forearm into the rear knee joint

The Punk buckles and Storm now has one of his legs in
both arms and pins the other leg with his left knee

We see the leg held in Storms arms begin to twist
and with a blood-curdling scream we hear a LOUD SNAP

SIRENS are heard approaching outside

tape into the deck

and is held and excited by his contradictions They come
closer together clinking their glasses sipping

kissing more deeply Storm helps Felicia slide out of

her teddy top her beautiful breasts rise into the light
Storm begins to kiss them she moans with pleasure The
lovemaking increases in intensity Felicias hand groping

Storm lunges for his 45 on the nightstand Suddenly
LOUD and VIOLENT CRASH and the bedroom door is kicked in
Two dark figures with shotguns leveled fill the door

There is an eruption of GUNFIRE and blinding muzzle blast
and smoke In the dim light for a moment we do not know
what has happened then

STORMS POV

We see one of the assassins thrown backward jacket blown
open at the shoulder

SWITCH TO

ASSASSINS PARTNERS POV

We see Storm hit badly at close range He takes it in

the right center mass It looks like his right arm is

torn off as his 45 is literally blown across the room
Felicia is now hysterically screaming -- but not for long --
as she is mortally wounded We are sure Storm will

collapse and this horror will be over but Storm rushes

the remaining assailant and tilting his body sideways as

he enters he avoids one more ferocious BLAST

The momentum of Storms quick spin catches the assailant
perfectly and like a fast spinning top slammed against
another Storm has the puppet by the strings He clamps
down with his left and only good hand on the assailants
right hand and uses it against the gun as a tool for

more torque Spinning him around until he is at the peak
of his circle Storm with all his might spins his whole
body in the opposite direction quickly using the whipping
effect of his shoulder and hip to snap the assailants
wrist and flip him violently

There is a LOUD CRACK and scream as he lands on his head
and neck and then -- from the side point-blank --another
ferocious SHOTGUN BLAST -- Storm is blown into the air

and back onto the bed from which he came

Martha backs away -- toward a telephone

MARTHA
Im calling your superior officers

She picks up the phone Dunnes enormous hand engulfs
her wrist forces her to put the phone back in the cradle
The two cops stare at her penetratingly

Martha knows this is it -- life or death

She hurls the cat into Fords face the CAT claws him

INT ARMSTEAD HOUSE - NIGHT

Storm has found a zabutone meditation pillow and is sitting
on his knees in formal Japanese posture with black Dugi
pants and no shirt He unravels a package with Oriental
characters handwritten on the outside

In one section what looks like an old wax Baggie full
of Chinese herbs In the other Storm unfolds a pouch
containing an assortment of needles long short skinny
fat

Storm fingers the needles and finds a spot in his shoulder
with very bad scar tissue and quickly and coldly sticks
it in deep He then twirls and adjusts it

It is apparent that he knows what hes doing We STAY
CLOSE ON the needles noting the amount in the package
has greatly diminished
PULL UP to reveal Storm with at least 50 needles sticking
out of him

He is now frozen deep in meditation CAMERA CIRCLES AROUND

him 360 DEGREES -- he is like a Japanese statue

and begins to fill it in packing the earth tightly He
goes to the top of the boards and around them wraps a
length of old hemp rope Around and around The boards
stand up about six feet high Storm steps back observes
the height taps it lightly testing the recoil tension
Now he begins to punch it harder and harder Over and

EXT WOODED CLEARING - DAY
Storm again approaches the Makiwara

This time it is almost as if no walls can contain him
nothing in his mind can represent a barrier He has a
sense of total domination before he has begun

He begins much harder and faster continues driving his
fist deeper and faster and harder until even those twelve
inches of solid oak are not enough for him

With one lightning blow the OAK SPLINTERS and flies in
half Storm walks away with a frightening calm -- stalks
straight inside toward the gym

INT ARMSTEAD GYM - NIGHT

Storm has just finished a major aerobic workout and is
now doing some strange martial aerobic-type movements
He is sweating profusely and is dressed in a tiny black
tank top and black sweat pants

CAMERA PANS OVER TO a corner mirror and we see Andy peeking
through a crack in the door She is enjoying this
immensely She seems to be fighting her feelings and
finally she puffs up her courage Having made some
decision she enters

ANDY
Oh Im sorry I didnt mean to
interrupt I ah well I was just
passing by and

They stare at each other in quite a different way This
time its obvious what Andy wants and Storm probably
wants the same thing But he tries very hard to maintain
his one objective in life -- to get very strong and win
the upcoming battle

He looks at this woman who now Looks more beautiful than
anyone he has ever seen Storm throws down the light
weights in his hands and walks up to her

He gently grabs the back of her head and pulls her hair
back and kisses her on the mouth She seems to explode
with passion as she falls to the floor pulling him on
top of her

appears in the doorway returning from the kitchen with a
tray and glasses She wears a robe and has that mussed
after-lovemaking glow
She takes one look at Storm and her heart sinks

She crosses to him -- lowers herself gracefully to kneel
beside him setting down the tray and glasses

STORM
(dead)
Thanks

She looks at him She has a good idea whats tormenting
his mind She reaches her hand gently touches his
shoulder

Storm pulls back

STORM

He gets up backing slowly away from her -- seeing the
pain in her eyes feeling his own pain In frustration
he slams an elbow punch into a piece of gym equipment --
furiously venting rage Andy flinches at the sound the

Storm is reacting to the sight of his old home -- the
first time hes seen it since the slaughter seven years

Andy aware of his turmoil takes his hand Her hair is
done up in a businesslike style she wears a jacket and
carries a briefcase They cross to the front door --

Storm casually lingers behind drifting into the kitchen
He crosses immediately to the alcove where seven years
earlier he stashed the camera case

But the spot has been remodeled Theres a new wall there
STORM
New wall fucking yuppies

Without hesitation he slams his fist through --

WALL

of brick adjacent to a real brick wall six inches behind
the new wallboard Storm reaches into the hole yanks

out the camera case He shakes his sore knuckles from

the blow as

INT BATHROOM - HOLLAND

as he lifts the toilet seat to pee he finds a handwritten
note on the seat Shocked he nervously looks around

Seeing nothing

INSERT - NOTE

he picks up the note and reads it

Anticipation of death is worse than death itself

HOLLAND

A faint smile comes to his face with great confidence
As he backs out of the toilet he pulls his pistol from
his shoulder holster cocking it He cautiously exits

TRACKING

Holland as he
support team
confidence on
He then starts
pool to inform

INDOOR POOL

Holland enters
on his face is

moves toward the sporting room and his
He enters the area of carnage and the smug
his face starts to change to a slight worry
carefully making his way back to the indoor
Trent

the area and finds no one Now the look
one of fear and confusion

HOLLAND

Sonofabitch

But he has a plan His plan is to try to make it out of
the house in one piece What was once careful stalking
has turned into panicked blundering
CONTINUE TRACKING Holland as he bumps into things knocking
them over retreating wildly He passes a raging fireplace
and suddenly out of the shadows comes a voice

STORM (0S)
How does it feel to know youre
about to die

Holland FIRES in the direction of the voice and Storm
comes out of the shadows standing in plain view -- his
-45 pointed at Holland

STORM
Ill give you more time than you
and Trent gave my wife

Holland changes the point of his aim and FIRES again As
he fires Storm EMPTIES his GUN straight at Holland

WALL BEHIND HOLLAND

A Louis XIII portrait -- where a silver dollar-sized group
of holes has just appeared two inches above Hollands
head They are both out of ammo

STORMS POV

Holland picks up a fireplace poker Hes swinging like
maniac and we hear the sound of the poker SLASHING the
AIR

But he gets too close to Storm who snatches the poker
away from him

They are like two vicious cats whirling We see Holland
gasping in agony and hear the sound of BONES BREAKING

Storm then begins the search for Trent He casually
strolls through the house calling as if hes playing hide
and seek with a childhood friend

STORM
Vernon oh Verrrrrnon where are

you

Storm opens closets looks in drawers under the toilet
seat and then proceeds into --

INT MASTER BEDROOM

STORM
(loud enough
for Trent to
hear)
Lets see where could that bad
boy be

From the tragic violent rage to what almost seems like a
kiddie game we are not sure if Storm has gone mad or
what He approaches the master closet as he continues
the taunting melody

MASTER CLOSET

Storm enters and begins pushing the clothes of the racks
aside -- looking for something thats probably not there
Trent is too smart for this shit hes probably ona
jet to the Bahamas by now

One more rack of clothes in the farthest-back section
Storm reaches to shove it aside when with shocking and
deafening suddenness a SHOTGUN BLAST erupts point-blank

shredding 10000 worth of suit jackets and barely
missing Storms head Instantly a figure leaps out Storm
gently disarms him and the two men are for a moment frozen
eye to eye

STORM AND TRENT

Storm seems to drift off somewhere far away and then
violently slams Trent up against the wall pinning his
chest with the left hand Storm takes the sawed-off
shotgun by the handle and punches the barrel straight
into Trents mouth The barrel simply goes through the
teeth and in his mouth It appears Storm has made up his
mind about what to do Trents eyes bug out of his head

Storm now takes Trent by the hair and leads him through
the house shotgun still in his mouth

STORM
You know Trent I want to kill you
so bad I can barely contain myself
But I keep thinking that death is
far too merciful a fate for you
and that a nice petite white-bread
boy like you in a federal

penitentiary

(pause)
-- let me put it this way -- I doubt
whether you could remain anal
retentive for very long Yeah I

think thats best for you --

Trent is now so fucking scared he looks like he is about
to go out of his mind About this time in their journey
through the house Storm has stopped before Hollands
mangled and lifeless body If you think Trent was scared
before you should see him now

Storm curiously turns his back on Trent for a moment to
pick up handcuffs off the floor Trent sees his last
chance

Trent seizes the poker and does his most mighty Babe Ruth
impression Just as Storm stands up the poker comes
flying It looks like Storm is dead but somehow he steps
inside the arc and does shihonage which disarms Trent
and flips him backwards head-first into the fire

Trents neck is impaled by one of the decorative iron
arrows of the fireplace He is stuck -- struggling to
free himself from the arrow as his head catches fire

a fate somewhat worse than prison

Storm turns away --
FADE OUT

FADE IN

EXT CEMETERY - LONG SHOT - DAY

We are not sure where we are yet In the distance we
see a procession of marching men all wearing kilts and
all the accoutrements of traditional Scottish garb In
the front several paces ahead of the neatly marching
lines of men is a single BAGPIPER Behind all of them
is a hearse being nobly escorted by mounted police

FULL SHOT

Now we see them fully the colors the feeling the emotion
of caring men marching in the funeral parade of a fallen
comrade

CAMERA PANS OVER to reveal a section of mourners -- mostly
police but with some civilians The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER

and PANS TO the front row where we see Storm in full
police regalia a medal of valor around his neck Andy

and Sonny are standing near at sober attention

The procession stops and the lone bagpiper continues to
play the dirge as he walks up and takes his position ona
section of lawn The pallbearers remove the flag from

the casket and present it to the Chief of Police who now
slowly approaches the group of mourners and stops directly
in front of Sonny Storm He presents the flag and salutes
Sonny The lone bagpiper stops and an officer on TRUMPET
begins playing Taps The coffin is slowly lowered

FULL SCREEN - TV MONITOR

Finally the film that Storm shot that night seven years
ago on the wharf Spliced with the audiotape -- with
subtitles including each speakers name to make every
word and identity clear We see

The two Shadow Men step from the station wagon The
pushed film clearly reveals them to be Trent and Holland
We see them conspire with Calabrese and Vitale

CALABRESE (VO)
Murder is a serious business my
friend And an expensive one

TRENT (VO)
Im up to here with caution This
(bleep) lives on alfalfa sprouts
and bean curd he aint gonna die
of natural cause

Our SHOT starts to WIDEN revealing that the TV monitor
is in a news studio The nightly news is being broadcast
what we see on this monitor is simultaneously going out
over the air

As the SHOT WIDENS and TRAVERSES we begin to see the
actual news set -- including Esposito who got his well-
deserved scoop -- and other anchorpeople crewmen etc

CALABRESE (VO)
All Im counseling is a little
patience The man is public Hes
in the paper every day

TRENT (VO)
Yeah Well the next time I read
about him it better be in the
obituaries

CONTINUE MOVE as the wharf scene keeps playing The TV
monitor passes OUT OF FRAME SOUND goes DOWN were MOVING
PAST the news set and its occupants (who are readying to
go back on-camera as soon as the wharf tape ends) and on
UP TOWARD --

LIGHTS ABOVE NEWS SET

which now FILL the FRAME -- bright and blinding The
screen starts to bleach out it goes white and

MATCH CUT - SUN (MARINA DEL REY)

above a perfect peaceful sea A small powerboat (the

kind that you rent from the dock) moves INTO FRAME Storm
steers it standing up Andy and Sonny in the back cockpit
seat

IN ANDYS LAP - PORTABLE TV

She switches a channel up comes the same footage we just
saw on the news set

ANDY

It takes a beat before she realizes what it is Then

ANDY
Hey Seven year Storm
(indicates TV)
I told you youd be famous

Storm takes a step so he can see the screen Views it
for a short beat then --

STORM

picks the TV up from Andys lap and while its still
playing heaves it over the side and into the drink

OCEAN SURFACE - TV

splashes bobs for a few moments then sinks beneath
the surface

ANDY
(laughing)
Hey Whyd you do that

STORM

watching the last ripples from the sinking set A moment
between him and himself -- when the past is allowed to
slip away sink out of sight making way for the future

Storm turns back from the water surface to his son and
to the woman he loves He sits (letting the boat drift
wherever it wants to) and tugs Andy down beside him

Then he reaches across to his son pulls the boy to him
with a playful headlock

For a moment both Andy and Sonny are held in suspension
wondering what Storm will do or say

Finally
STORM
(to Sonny)
Knock knock
For a beat the boy is taken aback Then he breaks into
a broad smile
SONNY

Whos there
Storm glances to Andy pulling her tighter to him

STORM
Boo
SONNY
Boo who
STORM

You dont have to cry about it
(a beat then)
I love you both
Storm hugs his son with great affection pulling Andy to
him with his other arm This is their beginning
BOAT

drifts its happy way across the sun-shimmering sea

FADE OUT

THE END
