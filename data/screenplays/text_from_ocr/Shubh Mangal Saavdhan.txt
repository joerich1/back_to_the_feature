FADE IN
EXT BIRLA MANDIR GARDEN - DAY

An extremely happy moment of a Roka ceremony in the Birla

Mandir Garden compound over a shaadi dholak beat and a spoon
hitting on it The moments are captured in super slow motion
from the point of view of our principal characters Mudit and

Sugandha who are looking cluelessly at all the madness
around them with an eye of first timers

Sugandha’s mother getting up to hug MUDITS MOTHER
Uncles with sweaty armpits hugging each other

Heaving bosoms in expensive suits and sarees hug each
other

Tyagi dancing with a currency note in his mouth and a
dholwaala taking it from his mouth

A young mother turns in style and her long paranda hits
her toddler in the face and she cries

A chole bhature wala takes out a hot bhatura from the
pan

Sugandha’s father’s hand stretches to feed a laddoo to
Mudit’s father

A piece of the laddoo is falling to the ground and Joshi
family pet dog jumps with his mouth open to net the
piece mid-air

An uncle opens his mouth wide for a bite of chola
bhatura next to the wide mouthed statue of a lion

Over other slow motion shots of this sea of happiness we
hear Sugandha’s voice

SUGANDHA

Aur is tarah shuru hota hai ek aur

Everyone’s a part of the celebrations except Mudit and
Sugandha They are standing together but isolated and
almost forgotten They are pulled together to dance

Sorry thoda zyaada ho gayaPoint
yeh hai ki bahut kuch hota agar

They look at each other and smile A look at Mudit

From her POV Mudit appears confident catching the beat
perfectly Not too tall Not too short Nicely polished
shoes Neat and well shaven The brooch on his coat appears
to be his father’s Trying to be sophisticated even while
dancing on a traditional beat Trying hard to look and behave
like a dapper man His clutched lower lip suggests that he
might just break into a street style bhangra if given an
option

Mudit takes a deep breath and starts walking towards Sugandha
like a hero in trance Heart pounding with complete focus on
Sugandha He’s so intense in his concentration that he
doesn’t realise that he’s crossing paths with the dancing
Bhaalu Just when Mudit crosses past it it gets wild and
latches onto Mudit

TYAGI (CONTD)
Oh bhaincho Oye Bhaalu Nahin

Suddenly things turn for worse The bhaalu pins him down
Mudit is screaming and fighting but the bhaalu rolls him
over Tyagi and Duggal run towards Mudit

INT CINEMA HALL - DAY 5

A film is about to begin in a sparsely occupied dark cinema
hall
Before the film begins Sugandha’s mother’s testimonial
appears in a Shopping Network Ad on screen Telemarketing
logo flashing on screen in one corner Phone numbers running
as a ticker across the screen Sugandha’s mother sitting on a
chair with a large virtual screen behind her that showcases
the wi-fi enabled signalling product ‘Bahu Beti
Surakshakawach’ shown in the background Excitement whistles
and cheers amongst extended family members who occupy a full
row

SUGANDHA’S MOTHER

(on screen)
Pehle main apni beti ki security ko
lekar bahut pareshaan rehti thi
Aap toh jaante hi hain kunwaari

Beti Surakshakawach Iska ek device
mere paasaur doosra meri beti ke
bag mein rehta hai Isse mujhe uske
pal-pal ki khabar rehti haiaur

Meri sugar bhi kam ho gayi hai

The screen goes into a voiceover elaborating on the product
The product will have 2 pieces A transmitter and a receiver
similar on the lines of a tracker The product elaboration
will show a beeper LED light antennae

MrJoshi holds his wife’s hand

SUGANDHA’S FATHER
Chaa gayi tu Vimla I’m proud
of you yaar

Tears in their eyes as if its a huge achievement for the
family for Sugandha’s mother to appear on screen Sugandha
sitting at the end of the row also shows a thumbs up to her
mother Meanwhile onscreen a Bhojpuri film ‘Kab Hui Byaah
Hamaar’ begins

than the bhojpuri film

SUGANDHA’S MOTHER

Dekh tu us Ginni se milna julna
chodh dekhud toh kunwaari hai

Ginni is shocked to hear and gets up and pokes her head from
behind Sugandha and shouts

GINNI

mere liye bhi na bahut rishtey aa
rahe hainpar ladkon ko career

Sugandha’s mother is shocked to see Ginni there Father hits
his head The whole family is arguing across seats now and
everything is in open The film audience has turned around
and watching them even as Sugandha seems to be leaving
mumbling Ginni runs behind her

SUGANDHA
Itne saal yeh intezaar karti rahi

GINNI
(turns her around)
Oh Moti Bagh ki Cinderella
Tu chahti kya hai

Suddenly there’s dramatic music on screen The audience and
the family turns en masse towards the screen The bhojpuri
heroine with teary eyes spells out her cheesy but relevant
definition of love in a dialog

BHOJPURI ACTRESS
(Onscreen in bhojpuri
dialect)

Daisy tiwari mohabbat ke hamesa
khojtay rahnidaisy tiwari
hamesha mohabbat ke ichhukk
rahnii aur agar ee biyaah ho
gayil ta daisy tiwari hamesa ee
mohabbat khaatir jee hain kaaran

keemat baade jo dui dil ke baandh
ke rakh sakela humra ke aisi
mohabbat de da aye ricksawaala
aur ee daisy tiwari agle 7 kaa
700 janam tohaar bhayil

A bhojpuri song on love begins as we see Sugandha in the
flickering light of the dark theater The bhojpuri film
dialog has literally underlined Sugandha’s desire As if ina
fairy tale it’s the longing for love

EXT MUDIT’S OFFICE AREA - DAY 6

There’s no one inside He hears a voice He goes upto a

cubicle and says softly

Inside the cubicle Sugandha with Ginni holding up her lehenga
is shocked and embarassed

Mudit gives up and is about to leave when he hears someone
entering the washroom To not get caught he gets inside
Sugandha’s cubicle and is shocked to see Ginni there too

Sugandha is about to shout surprised but Mudit keeps a hand
on Sugandha’s mouth There’s sudden proximity between them
for the first time They look at each other both conscious
even as they hear someone coming in and hear all the noises
as they keep mum Ginni is caught between them When the
noise dies down Mudit takes off his hand

MUDIT
Shagun dilwa do

remains quiet Mudit gets frustrated and just walks out of

Mudit is shocked to see the girl Even before he can react
she pulls him close and hugs him He’s awkward shocked
frustrated and doesn’t know what to do

Pia is very physical with Mudit and just when she hugs him
again Sugandha comes out of the bathroom with Ginni
Sugandha immediately gets alert to Pia’s overtures Mudit is
also conscious There’s stealing of glances even as Mudit
nods to Pia’s constant chatter

After a few seconds Sugandha begins to move towards her
mother Mudit knows she’s going to say no

PIA (CONTD)
Yaad hai college ke farewell waale
din tumne mujhse kya kaha tha

MUDIT

She wants to hug him again but Mudit backs off in tension
and says

Mudit rushes towards Sugandha even as Pia waves him a bye
smiling

Sugandha goes upto her mother and says

SUGANDHA

Mudit suddenly shocked stops in his tracks and takes a few
seconds to take in the news Everyone’s happy and the music
begins and over it we return to the slow mo visuals of the
opening Roka scene

PBS 1 BEGINS

During this song we see the Roka ceremony happen Look
exchange between Sugandha and Mudit They both know
something is not right yet But the family doesn’t careThe
roka happens The families enjoy and dance but during their
interaction when Mudit’s hand brushes against Sugandha’s
indavertantly she backtracks a bit as if very conscious of
his abrupt presence in her life

Shots of Sugandha and Mudit’s courtship period adjusted td3A
the humdrum of Delhi life

In the office area during lunch time Sugandha is waiting
for him at the tea stall but when an eager Mudit arrives she
puts up an act of not being too eager to meet him

He buys mungphalli for her but she doesn’t want They cross
the shakarkandi stall He asks but she doesn’t want

14B

Angry he gives a pass to the ram laddoo stall but Sugandha
stops and asks the guy to make one for her Mudit backs up
and stands with her

In the evening Mudit offers to drop her on his bike He’s
even carried another helmet for her but she politely declines
as if she’s still not comfortable

She goes in a DTC bus and Mudit angrily rides next to the
bus both looking at each other Mudit’s fined by the Traffic
cop and Sugandha’s bus leaves with Sugandha smiling at him

She’s teaching dance steps to some neighbourhood kids and
Mudit who has come to give something to her parents looks at
her They sit on the chatt talking hoping to find some time
alone but mother comes to check on them with the pretext of
taking clothes from the clothesline Father also comes with
the odd pretext of cleaning the cooler during winters Mudit
takes their leave even as colony people are watching

They have lunch together on a bench outside their office Him
trying what she has got and saying I love it even when he
doesn’t like it much She gets to know and goes away angrily
taking his unfinished lunch box too He’s stranded

Another evening as she comes out of the office He hands his
bike to Tyagi and Duggal and boards the bus with her to her
home But its so crowded that he’s too faraway from her
Until one night Sugandha calls

heavy She’s blushing recalling the moment when Mudit’s lips
touched hers She takes out her cellphone and types a message

impromptu kiss their sexual energies are high and both are
too conscious of each other’s presence Sugandha starts
picking up the scattered phone

MUDIT
aamain jodh deta hoon

Mudit takes the broken phone and begins to assemble Sugandha
looks on very conscious Unable to decide if she should
adjust the strand of hair on her face or stand back cross-—
armed and look whereat himhis face the phone She’s
confused and it shows

Sugandha bends down to look for the battery thanking her
stars that she got something to do Under the sofa under the
table Now Mudit is in a fix Unable to fix his gaze he ends
up ogling at her body He decides to help her too and within
no time they are in close proximity to each other Their
hands touch and they look at each otherBEAT They begin to
kiss literally eating each other like hungry animals The
wet sounds of their kiss fill up the modest living room even
as Sugandha is taken aback by his desperate surge of
hormones

SUGANDHA
Bahut aawaz ho rahi haiDDA ke

Mudit calms down but doesn’t stop kissing The room is filled
with family photographs and completely out of place
decorative pieces Sugandha as a toddler in a photo studio
Sugandha as a kid with family outside a temple in Nepal
Sugandha as a gawky teenager smiling a toothy grin It’s like
Sugandha is growing in front of Mudit’s eyes Like the whole
room is watching them in their intimate moment Mudit stops
Breathing heavy The thermocol model of the windmill Sugandha
made in her school moves with his breath

Sugandha thinks then quickly fishes for something in a
drawer It’s a pack of chewing gum

She gives one pellet to Mudit and takes one herself They
both stand in front of each other chewing gum quickly to mask
the bad breath Few seconds of random chewing and looking
around they take it out and wrap it in a newspaper and keep
it aside and start kissing again This is when Mudit notices
the stern looking grandparents picture in their hey days as
if really angry Its like the final straw

Its like a bargain and Mudit plays the big chaal He takes
off his belt and unzips his trousers She’s stunned Too
conscious she just takes off her sandals as if accepting
defeat But Mudit is not going to give up He comes on to her
and his little thrust pushes her body on the switch board
behind The radio comes on as he kisses her on the neck

shouts at them

looks at Sugandha)
Sorrymain

She goes down the stairs Mudit goes behind her But Sugandha
doesn’t stop Meanwhile the boys kite lands on his terrace
and one of the boys shouts ‘BhaiyyaKanni de do’ They
giggle and Mudit picks up their kite and destroys it taking
out his frustration

INTEXT MUDIT’S HOUSE - DAY 25

Over sad music Sugandha’s family leaves Sugandha comes down
the stairs miffed Mudit follows her and even as she’s
touching her in laws feet with her head covered there’s a
constant look exchange between them The whole colony is
standing in the balcony trying to have a look at the would be
bride

Sugandha and family leave in a tourist cab Neither Mudit
waves Sugandha a bye nor Sugandha makes any effort His
worried reflection juxtaposed on her tensed face visible
through the window pane of the taxi sets the tone for a tough
ride for the couple in the time to come by

badly executed series of before and after With the parrot
continuing in the background they see through the album On
left side the guy is standing haggard and on the right he
looks equally haggard but with 3-4 kids and smiling showing
his badly stained teeth Mudit looks iffy about the whole
thing but Tyagi is really impressed and smiles

Mudit looks at him angrily when a really old frail guy with
a flowing beard barely able to stand coughing continously
comes out with the help of a young girl They all get
apprehensive

Abey yeh toh khud na ho pa

Just then a little child comes running out and hands over the
spectacles to the young girl

looking at the old guy Mudit is still apprehensive The
young girl goes away leaving the old guy who’s so weak he’s
swinging left to right Mudit and company wait for him to
fall but he keeps swinging from left to right To the trio’s
horror the old guy extends his one hand and plucks a huge
sword hanging on the wall Mudit Tyagi and Duggal get up
disrupting a few things

Mudit tries to say something but Sugandha angrily shows him a
finger and gestures him to sit Mudit sits Sugandha plays
some music through her cellphone Mudit is confused as
Sugandha looks around to see if they are alone They are
indeed

Suddenly the music changes and the next soundtrack is
exactly the same as in the Sexy Siren video Sugandha starts
moving whimpering a bit Mudit is taken aback Looks around
and gulps Sugandha picks up the Alu Bukhaara from the
plastic bag and tries to bite it seductively but is very
sloppy doing it But she still continues She stops and
squirms

MUDIT
Kya hua

SUGANDHA
Khatta hai

Mudit tries to get up again to come to her as if to comfort
her but Sugandha with an angry expression makes him sit She
dumps the half eaten alu bukhara on the side and seductively
opens the zipper of the jacket she’s wearing Underneath
she’s wearing a skimpy sphaggeti top just like the Sexy
Siren It’s looking like a novice’s bad attempt but she
continues She makes all sorts of sounds to appear seductive
and says these seductive lines but with a sense of defeat in
her voice

SUGANDHA (CONTD)
Come on Danny BoyI am waiting
for you Danny BoyI will do
things to youyou cannot even
imagine

(As she’s saying these
words tears come to her
eyesShe chokes a bit)

What do you want me to do for you
Danny boy

Mudit suddenly notices the discomfort Sugandha is putting

herself into for him She’s about to cry and he feels bad
Suddenly their’s a rustling of leaves and Sugandha scared
pulls up her jacket and stops the music She looks scared
But it turns out to be a squirrel with the half eaten alu

bukhara in its hand looking at them with wide gaping eyes
Sugandha cries and just hugs Mudit crying

SUGANDHA (CONT’D)
Nahin hota mujhseMuditNahin
hota Nahin banna aata mujhe Sexy
Siren Nahin help kar sakti main

Mudit hugs her to calm her down After an awkward moment
Sugandha just gets up and leaves leaving Mudit more
concerned than ever

Sugandha comes running with anticipation to look for Mudit
One by one haggard baraatis of all shapes and sizes tumble
out from the bus giving away their Frooti tetrapaks but
there’s no sign of Mudit Sugandha’s eyes slowly turn moist
and she loses hope with each passing second

Sugandha’s father and Tauji stand with maalas and pasted
smiles

while kissing every male member of the baraat much to their
displeasure including Mudit’s father who wipes his cheek
after the wet chummi Sugandha’s father standing embarassed
in the background finally speaks when Tauji proceeds to kiss
the bus driver A teenage relative also lights up pataakhas
in the background but when Mudit is not seen they try to
extinguish the lit patakhas

SUGANDHA’S FATHER
Bhaiyya wo driver hai

dhol waalas start playing and from the back of the bus Mudit
and friends come to the fore Patakhas are lit again
Sugandha turns and smiles wide

close to take his chummi puckering his lips for the camera
but Mudit rudely snubs him off taking the welcome garland
from his hand Tauji seems hurt and angry Sugandha looks at
all this as Mudit goes off Ginni who’s come next to Sugandha
comes and tells her

EXT OUTSIDE BARAAT GHAR - NIGHT 70

With full band baaja Mudit makes an entry dancing alone in
front of the bus even as the bus re-enters the narrow lane
with baraatis irritated in various states of undress and
duress The neighbors have come out in their balconies
looking at Mudit dancing Through the hanging electrical
wires Sugandha looks at Mudit even as he dances in a
peculiar way passing by locals who stand still to let the
baraat pass by

The dance looks funny because of the style but Mudit’s eyes
are burning with passion Set on Sugandha on the terrace who
witnesses this shocking showmanship from Mudit No one else
but Sugandha understands why Mudit is doing Despite the sea
of people all around its a moment of love laced with anger
between the two They don’t take eyes off each other even for
a single moment

This intense moment between the two is captured by the

videographer Ajit with much happiness and satisfaction He
looks at Mudit with a smile and then at Sugandha He feels

something is on

AJIT

Jungle mein mor ko naachte hue
dekha hai kabhi

(assistant nods a no)
Aaj dekh le kuch aur ho na
hoyeh shaadi ka video mujhe
jaroor kahin le jaayega Cloj
lecloj lecloj le

Mudit reaches the door of the baraat ghar and then dances
right upto Sugandha’s tauji and offers him his cheek

Sugandha’s tauji urged by Sugandha’s father finally smiles

and takes his chummi even as everyone cheers

Inside the bus even the baraatis are impressed by Mudit’s

act Everyone claps and cheers except Mudit’s father who

suspects something is on

EXT HARIDWAR ROAD - DAY

INT BARAAT GHAR KITCHEN - NIGHT 78

Sugandha runs and reaches the makeshift rasoi put up under
the tent behind the baraat ghar and smiles noticing Mudit
with his shirt tied around his waist In his baniyaan he’s
standing and stirring a huge pateela of dal His biceps curl
as he makes circular movements Sugandha flips looking at him
and like a doe-eyed teenage girl rests herself on the pillar
with a smile enjoys her own Jodha-Akbaresque moment

Ajit and company rush and take the groom’s shot cooking
himself for his baraat 2-3 kids also come and start helping
having fun Mudit sits down in front of a huge pile of
potatoes and starts peeling with vengeance Sweat on his
brow clenched jaw there’s something manly about him Their
families also come and stand on two opposing sides with
Sugandha and Mudit in the middle literally and figuratively
dividing the house

Mudit gives them a cold stare but goes soft when he notices
Sugandha standing closeby They both look at each other They
are in the moment with no care of tomorrow no awareness of
yesterday Ajit understanding the tenderness of the moment
taps his assistants to go close

They are now face to face with their families watching in
trepidation

Music begins as both sides pull up their socks and Mudit and
Sugandha retire to their respective sides

PBS 4 79

The song begins and we see Mudit-Sugandha’s pre-wedding video
is being shot with Mudit and Sugandha doing dance steps
together and posing for wedding album shots at iconic
locations of Haridwar Even the families are sucked into this
strange medley Mudit’s father and Sugandha’s father have to
do a step together even when they are cross with each other
The mothers pretend to be okay but nothing seems to be okay
between the families

It’s like a clash of not just two Indian families but many
Indias with the backdrop of Haridwar The tension between the
families is palpable throughout the process

Amidst the cold vibes tender and sensuos moments between
Mudit and Sugandha catches everyone’s eyes as Mudit teaches
her the steps for the wedding video

MUDIT SHOWS SUGANDHA THAT HE HAS INDEED DOWNLOADED THE
MAKEMYTRIP APP TO PLAN FOR THE HONEYMOON DESPITE ALL THE
TENSION AND A TUG OF WAR BETWEEN THE FAMILY MEMBERS SUGANDHA
SMILES MISTY EYED LOOKING AT THE APP EMOTIONAL BECAUSE OF
MUDIT’S EARNESTNESS SHE’S PLEASED THAT HE’S INDEED MAKING AN
EFFORT FOR THEIR MARRIAGE SHE’D LOOK AT HIM ROMANTICALLY AND
ADMIRE HIM FOR PUTTING UP A BRAVE FRONT AT SUCH A JUNCTURE
IT BECOMES ONE OF THE ROMANTIC MOMENTS IN THE SONG

The scene shifts back to the baraat ghar where amidst
sangeet practice pre-wedding gamesrituals are on with both
sides egging their respective wards

Sugandha wins the ring finding game Her family is ecstatic
while Mudit’s family is seething

The song continues over other rituals While having food at
the baraat ghar Mudit and Sugandha’s eyes meet as they stand
in the line for food with their respective families Sugandha
discreetly gestures to Mudit ‘one day gone’ Mudit nods with
a forced smile trying to portray a picture of calm despite
himself

The baraat goes for a dip in the holy river Everyone’s
scared to enter the freezing river even as Sugandha’s father
and other members dip nonchalantly This irks Mudit’s family
and they all enter the holy ganga holding hands to take a dip
in the river and to proclaim one-up-manship

The song resumes as we now see haldi ceremony of Mudit and
Mehendi ceremony of Sugandha going on They cross paths
again Looking at each other from far Sugandha looks a bit
nervous but Mudit does something to cheer her up Sugandha
smiles and gestures ‘One day left’ and Mudit nods and eats
another chocolate

Tyagi and Duggal at the mandir with the rest of the family
taking parikrama of a shivling MUDITS MOTHER is doing it
diligently reciting mantras

Finally the Sangeet begins As various family members perform
with gusto and vigour amidst complete breakdown of
communication between the two families Sugandha and Mudit
look at each other from far Its clear from their determined
expressions that tonight is the night of reckoning for them

PBS 4 Ends
INT BARAAT GHAR COMPOUND - NIGHT 80

In the quiet of the night muffled sounds of bangles can be
heard Reveal Sugandha and Mudit holding hands look around
and discreetly enter a room and shut the door from inside

EXT SANGEET AREA - NIGHT

Its deserted now at the Sangeet venue Sugandha’s family is
still sitting there really worried Sugandha’s father is
agitated and shifting around in his chair

Sugandha’s father hits his hand on his head Sugandha’s taiji
looks at tauji and he gets a bit conscious

SUGANDHA’S TAUJI

making a face)

Sugandha’s mother thinks for a while and suddenly gets up to
go

nevertheless)

Stay on the door when sound of cricket commentary is heard
from far

JUMP CUT TO

Tyagi and Duggal are listening to cricket commentary on a
radio All through the scene family members of both sides
will continue to assemble in the compound right outside the
door where Sugandha and Mudit have gone

COMMENTATOR 1
Bahut hi kareebi maamla ho sakta
hai yeh bhaarat ke liye 6 ball 9

gathering)
Koi bhi apni seat chodh kar jaane

COMMENTATOR 2
Gar paar hua toh

uthaane ke ilaawa ab aur koi chaara
nahin hai Har ball pe unhein
uthaana hoga

The commentary continues as Tyagi asks Duggal

TYAGI
Kya lagta haikar lega

Duggal shrugs when Sugandha’s mother is seen conducting a
mini mobile yagya hearing mantra with the help of Youtube
adding ghee to a small fire in a bowl Sugandha’s father also
comes along worried

SUGANDHA’S MOTHER
Sunohyeh loSwaaha pe ghee
daalte rehna Panditji ne bola
haisau baar mantra padhna hai

GINNI
Sau baar ka time nahin hai aunty
ji Aajkal jaldi ho jaata

SUGANDHA’S MOTHER
(hearing swaaha)
Arey daalo na ghee

Sugandha’s father looks at Mudit’s parents huddled in one
corner Gablu chacha passes by Tyagi and Duggal

GABLU CHACHA
Tere kitne likhoon

TYAGI
Aapne kitne lagaaye hain

GABLU CHACHA
Do saulaunda kar lega

TYAGI

Slowly and steadily others are also gathering in the
compound Sugandha’s tauji tensed goes upto Sugandha’s
father and says

SUGANDHA’S TAUJI
Shaadi ke do menu banwa raha
hoonagar ho gaya toh Dal makhni

(father looks)

Chotey shaadi ho na hokhaana toh

Finally the camera comes and rests on Ajit and his assistant

AJIT

Mudits Mother’s sobbing continues as father says

MUDITS MOTHER
Baap ka dil patthar hota haiMaa

As Mudit’s mother raises her voice a bit Sugandha’s mother
comes and holds her hand in solidarity Both mothers start
crying now

MUDITS MOTHER (CONT’D)
Itna sa tha jab doctor ne usey mere
haathon mein diya tha

SUGANDHA’S MOTHER
Main aapka dard samajh sakti

They start sobbing again

MUDITS MOTHER
Meri nanhi si jaan

MUDIT’S FATHER

Sugandha’s father smirks sarcastically and Mudit’s father

notices

MUDIT’S FATHER (CONT’D)
Bahut hansi aa rahi hai aapko

SUGANDHA’S FATHER
Sambdhihue na hain abhi

MUDIT’S FATHER
Nahin wo toh dekh lengeyhumne

kheli par aapko bahut hansi aa
rahi hai Kapil Sharma ka show

Mudit’s father nudges him a bit and Sugandha’s father also
gets aggressive Others run upto them to pull them apart Its
a full house from both sides now

SUGANDHA’S FATHER
Bina haath lagaaye baat kijiye
aap

MUDIT’S FATHER
Nahin hum toh pair bhi
lagaayengeyyeh lijiyehum
ladkewaale hainhamaare bhi human
right hotey hain

Even as their argument reaches a peak the door opens
Suddenly there’s pindrop silence as Sugandha and Mudit come
out slowly Sound of bangles paayal Sugandha adjusts her
hair Mudit tucks his gold plated chain inside the shirt
Without even looking at each other they move towards their
respective groups Mudit goes upto Duggal and Tyagi and they
ask him in gestures kya hua Mudit smiles with an air and
nonchalantly shakes his head as if suggesting ho gaya

Celebrations erupt all across the compound The dhol waalas
start playing Tyagi and Duggal start dancing impromptu Both
the fathers hug emotionally ecstatic Gablu chacha takes the
money Sugandha’s mother breaks the naariyal

There Ginni looks at Sugandha and in response to her question
nods a sad no Slowly and steadily the gloom spreads and the
celebrations stop slowly

Gablu chacha has to return the money Sugandha’s mother is
left holding the broken naariyal and the two fathers leave
each other confused Everyone is confused So are Mudit and
Sugandha

Mudit turns and looks at Sugandha who’s looking at Mudit
confused too Mudit mumbles

MUDIT
Kya Ho toh gaya
SUGANDHA
(mumbles wide eyed)
Muditnahin

Mudit smirks shocked and holding his head steps up towards
her as if she doesn’t know anything She too steps towards
him shaking her head at his innocence They get into a
murmuring conversation discussing the intricate
technicalities of the act even as the entire crowd is
waiting for a resolution with werid expressions as if
deciphering what exactly the two are talking

MUDIT
Hua toh

SUGANDHA
Tchpaagal ho kya Muditnahin
hua

MUDIT
Arey hua hai yaar

SUGANDHA
Aapne bol diya ho gaya toh ho
gaya main kya taali bajaane ke
liye baithi hoon

MUDIT
NahinSugandha hua hai yaar

Sugandha in cute and shy whispers explains and Mudit is
stumped for a second and within moments starts giggling
himself Only bits and pieces of their conversation can be
heard

MUDIT (CONT’D)
Toh matlab main wo jab(murmurs
something really seriously)

SUGANDHA
(unable to stop her
on giggle)
nabilkulsunoh (murmurs
something barely able to hold back
her coy smile)

Sugandha is gesturing with her hands as she’s talking and the
crowd is mimicking their smiley expressions and trying hard
to read her hand gestures in anticipation as if the answer is
just about to come but is left utterly confused

Ajit’s assistant is smiling hugging the camera lost in the
lovey dovey exchange of the couple

MUDIT
(shakes his head and
smiles sheepishly)
Bhains ki aankhyeh toh

Sugandha now giggles loud and holds back her laughter and
holds Mudit’s chin like a kid and nods a no

SUGANDHA
Nahin hua

They both are smiling and laughing literally like kids Their
body language is like two thick friends giggling at each
other for cheating a wrong answer off each other in a school
examination

GABLU CHACHA
Oye yaarkoi bataayegahua ya
nahinbhaincho paise lene hain-
dene hain

Mudit now smiles wide and looks at Duggal and Tyagi and
shakes his head and says

MUDIT
Oyenahin hua yaar

There’s commotion amongst the crowd Discussions
specualtions and murmurs but Mudit and Sugandha continue
talking as if nothing has happened

INT SUGANDHA’S ROOM - EARLY MORNING 81

Its early morning still dark outside Sugandha is sleeping
when her mother comes in tensed

SUGANDHA’S MOTHER
Sugandhauthsugandhauth

Sugandha is too groggy to react when she hears this Just
then her father comes from behind really agitated

SUGANDHA
Baaki log kya sochte hain mujhe

As she begins to leaves with vengeance Sugandha’s mother
gives her a tea cup in hand

SUGANDHA’S MOTHER
Yeh chai le jakhaali haath honey

Sugandha’s father and Mother with dupatta both run behind
her

EXT BARAAT GHAR TERRACE - EARLY MORNING 82

A kaleidoscopic formation of various kids from the baraat
sleeping on the terrace next to a cot on which Mudit seems
to be asleep Out of the blue a woman’s hand enters Mudit’s
baniyan As Mudit smiles the woman gets inside his chaddar
and hugs him tight

MUDIT
(groggy )
Mujhe le ke aap kitne positive ho
Sugandha Ek aur baari try

Mudit turns and is shocked to see Pia next to him literally
throwing herself at him

MUDIT (CONTD)
Piatum yahaan kya kar rahi

PIA
Wahijo ab tak tum Sugandha ke
saath nahin kar paaye

MUDIT
Nahinnahinnahinnahintum

PIA

mujhe sab bata diya hai

As she talks she comes closer to him and gives him a peck a
kid wakes up and Mudit gestures to him angrily to sleep off

PIA (CONTD)
Pata hai us din jab main tumse
rokey pe mili thi natoh mujhe
lag hi raha tha ki tumhaare aur
Sugandha ke beech mein koi problem
hai

(comes closer and asks

softly)
College trip pe hum ghanton hotel

BEAT Mudit for just a few seconds actually gets into a
doubt He thinks something and then as a knee jerk reaction
he presses his lips against Pia’s But the very next second
his eyes go wide with horror as he notices Sugandha holding a
tea-cup with her mother father and even Ginni are standing
on the terrace looking at them in shock

SUGANDHA’S FATHER
Waahwaahwahaan tumhaare papa
kele ka pedh le kar tayyar khade

aurat ke moonh mein moonh maar rahe
hodekh liya Sugandha jo tujhe
dekhna tha

MUDIT

Sugandha throws the tea cup on the ground with vengeance and
begins to go down the stairs Mudit dressed in a baniyan and
lungi jumps out from his cot and hops his way over the
sleeping kids to reach Sugandha but she has left Sugandha’s
mother who’s crying with shock starts hitting Mudit like a
woman possessed

SUGANDHA’S MOTHER

Khabardaar jo uske paas bhi gaya

Mudit jerks his lungi away from him Mudit is talking as he
makes his way down the narrow stairs

SUGANDHA’S FATHER
Arey koi roko is hawas ke pujari

INT BARAAT GHAR STAIR CASE - MORNING 82A

Other relatives led by Sugandha’s Tauji and Taiji are coming
up the stairs hearing the sound Mudit keeps going behind
Sugandha Sugandha’s mother even in her sobbing makes a loop
of the dupatta and throws it on Mudit It misses him

SUGANDHA’S MOTHER
Arey roko iseymeri bachchi ki
zindagi barbaad kar ke bhaag raha

Sugandha goes past them but Other relatives start hitting
Mudit as he goes down the stairs

SUGANDHA’S TAUJI
Naaspeeteypata hai kitna kharcha

SUGANDHA’S TAAT

82B

Mudit somehow saves himself from all the thappads and
chappals and makes his way to the ground floor but is unable
to catch up with Sugandha

EXT BARAAT GHAR - MORNING 82B

Sugandha runs out towards the compound where Mudit’s father
holding a kele ka pedh is standing with the panditji
Oblivious to what has happened above he smiles and says

MUDIT’S FATHER
Areyaa gayi bahuaajadekh
kele ka pedh bhi mil gaya

Sugandha defies him and just walks past him in anger Mudit’s
father looks confused and says

MUDIT’S FATHER (CONT’D)
Arey kam se kam dupatta toh pehan
jaati baahar

Sugandha has walked out of the baraat ghar
EXT BARAAT GHAR - MORNING 82C

Mudit comes running from behind and behind him Sugandha’s
family baying for his blood Mudit meets his father at the
door

MUDIT’S FATHER
Betahumne tay kar liya

Just then Sugandha’s family reaches there

MUDIT’S FATHER (CONT’D)
Arey tu hamaari side hai ya unki

pedh se shaadi karni hogi

SUGANDHA’S FATHER
Kele ke pedh se kyameri Suggu

MUDIT’S FATHER

He takes out another set of bills and begins to rattle off
all the kharcha but nothing can be heard in the cacaphony

MUDIT’S FATHER
Agar hum khaali haath gaye toh yeh
hamaara apmaan hoga

SUGANDHA’S FATHER
Jaaokiya apmaan

MUDIT’S FATHER

to do now)

Lekin hum phir bhi khaali haath

SUGANDHA’S FATHER
Suggu shaadi nahin karegi

MUDIT’S FATHER
Karegi

Both the fathers and the families come head to head and Mudit
tries to intervene and say something but no one listens

EXT BARAAT GHAR - MORNING 82D

Mudit is highly frustrated now and walks up to the hawan kund
where a banana tree stem is erected along with other
essentials

MUDIT
Aap aur aapka yeh kele ka

The panditji without wasting a second begins to read the
mantra and directing Mudit what to do With rage and
frustration written all over Mudit he goes through the
ceremony

PANDITJI

Mudit continues to hold the burning wood in hand and wiping
the sweat off his brow takes pheras Crowd from outside has
also gathered to see the tamaasha Mudit is mumbling away
then suddenly shouts

Everyone is silent Mudit begins to leave when his father
says

MUDIT’S FATHER
Agar tu us ladki ke peeche gaya toh
meri jaaydaad mein se ek paisa
nahin milega tujhe

Mudit turns and looks at his father and then throws his
wallet towards his father

MUDIT
Nahin chahiye aapke paise par
licence waapas de denamaine khud
banwaaya tha RTO jaa ke

The father is shocked as Mudit now starts walking towards the
gate The music picks up and within seconds he starts to
brisk walk then runs and picks up speed and even in his
lungi and banyan he runs as fast as he can Ajit stops his
recording looking at him going away says

AJIT
Dekhabana diya na hero Yeh

AJIT’S ASSISTANT

EXT HARIDWAR STREETS - DAY 83

Over music In a long shot Mudit runs desperately through
the streets and alleys of Haridwar With tears in his eyes
he runs for his life

Through an alley he passes by a bhaalu dancing to the tune
of a madaari entertaining some kids Mudit runs past them
without paying much heed

Sugandha’s eyes her smile her anger her touch and the time
he has spent with her the good and the bad moments they have
gone through all rush through his head

EXT HARIDWAR UDAN KHATOLA BOARDING POINT - DAY 84

The music reaches a crescendo as Mudit reaches the base of
the Mansa Devi Mandir The starting point of the Udan
Khatola a cable car that takes devotees to the Mansa Devi
Mandir can be seen far in the background There’s a crowd
interested in watching Jimmy shoot crowds around and stands
in his way

A news reporter stands in front of the camera to introduce

Chalao bhai Udan Khatola chalao
Hero ke liye

The Udan Khatola moves and Mudit’s energy is palpable as he’s
slowly going up The News Reporter has set his camera on the
Udan Khatola now Everyone is waiting with bated breath Just
as Mudit’s Udan Khatola reaches in the middle he notices
Sugandha sitting in another coming back from the opposite
side He shouts

MUDIT
SugandhaSugandha

Sugandha looks at him surprised and looks away Her Udan
Khatola is coming closer

MUDIT (CONT’D)
Sugandha pleasemujhe ek baar
baat karne ka mauka toh do
yaar

Sugandha doesn’t even look at him her Udan Khatola comes
even closer Mudit doesn’t think for a second and jumps from
his khatola to Sugandha’s Its a clumsy attempt which gives
jitters to everyone

Mudit hurts his face and starts bleeding but barely manages
to hold on to the last bar of the Udan Khatola in the nick of
time and hangs precariously from there

SUGANDHA
Muditaap paagal ho gaye ho

Everyone below gasps and Jimmy Shergill shouts

JIMMY SHERGILL
Oye bandh karo yaar Khatole ko

The Udan Khatola stops with Mudit hanging precariously
Sugandha looks at Mudit bleeding There’s an awkward silence
but their gaze doesn’t shift from each other

Bhaipatiya just another guy
bann ke yeh gumshuda ghoom raha
haiUsey is tarah latakta hua
chodhnahamaare samaaj ki sabse
badi tragedy hogi

(After a prolonged look
Sugandha gives him a
hand)

Usey zaroorat hai saath kiek
aise haath ki jo usey sahi disha
mein kheench sake

(Mudit gets pulled up
somehow Sugandha and
Mudit hug
passionatelyeveryone
claps below)

Better Half ki is ladaayi meindo

Over music we see them coming down the udan khatola amidst
the gathered crowd Mudit gets dragged away by some people on
one side Sugandha is surrounded by some women on the other
side Giving water asking if all is fine Even amidst the
crowd they are looking at each other Finally Mudit makes
way through the crowd and goes upto Sugandha and extends his
hand towards her Sugandha gives a prolonged look

INT BARAAT GHAR - NIGHT 86

MUDIT
(vo)
Hum bhaageFamily se ladhe
bike nahin thibag bhi nahin tha

SUGANDHA
(vO)
Par life long pyaar ka promise toh
tha

Mudit and Sugandha appear in the narrow alley Mudit with an
air of confidence and Sugandha resting her chin on his
shoulder tightly clasping him with her arms Both seem to
have cried a lot Both the families at the baraat ghar are
struck Nonchalant yet defiant they get down the bike and
enter the baraat ghar compound

MUDIT
(vO)
Dono ke papa ne maa behan ki
gaaliyan toh zaroor di hongi par

MUDIT (CONTD)
pehli baar gusse mein kisi ke papa
cute nahin lageShaadi ki tension
mein Sugandha apne papa ki heart
problem bhi bhool gayikisi ki
mummy bhi depression mein nahin
aayishaadi kaisi huikisi ko
dhyaan nahin raha
Actually agar sahi jodi mil jaaye
natoh shaadi shoshey waali ho ya
na ho koi fark hi nahin padhta

Mudit confidently sets up the hawankund Sugandha gets the
wood Mudit tears off the ghee packet with his mouth and
pours the ghee in the hawan kund As Sugandha washes her face
and checks herself out in the bike mirror Mudit lights up a
newspaper from the nearby chai stall and lights up the hawan
fire Everyone is watching awestruck without uttering any
word Mudit pulls down a shamiana cloth and tears it apart in
the middle He ties it around his waist and extends his hand
towards Sugandha who now takes his hand (UNTIL THIS PART
WILL BE INTERCUT WITH PREVIOUS SCENE WHERE MUDIT EXTENDS HIS
HAND )

They now take pheras even as their parents look on nervous
They both smile and busy in their own world continue to take
pheras of the fire

Sugandha’s mother murmurs something to her husband
Sugandha’s father doesn’t respond On the other side
MUDITS MOTHER pulls her husband and with tears in her eyes
rolls a currency note around them and gives it to the band
guy

Mudit and Sugandha stop and touch everyone’s feet as a song
takes over Slowly and steadily miffed family members come
around after a bit of cajoling Tyagi and Duggal dance So do
Mudit and Sugandha and even both the fathers As everyone
dances on the beat we hear Sugandha’s voice In three cuts
we follow their life

SUGANDHA VO
Is kahaani ka the end toh ho gaya
lekin jis Climax ka aap intezaar
kar rahe hainwo na Suhaag raat
pe hua

(Both their bridal wear
kept crushed in the
foregroundthem
sleeping in bg)

Na Goa ke honeymoon pe

(Towels designed in
heart shaped on the bed
as they enter the hotel
room)

INTEXT MUDIT’S HOUSE - DAYNIGHT 87

In visuals through objects we see how Mudit and Sugandha
have got into the humdrum of life at Mudit’s house Both
getting ready for office in the morning rush

INT MUDIT’S HOUSE - DAY 88

MUDITS MOTHER
Bolo Shri Satyanarayan bhagwaan ki
jai

Mudit’s mother finishes the satyanarayan katha at home
Sugandha distributes the prasad to everyone When she does it
to Mudit Mudit gestures her to come in Sugandha smiles coy
Mudit insists and Sugandha somehow excuses herself and goes
in

As she enters Mudit holds Sugandha she laughs Him smiling
embarassed and she laughing at the whole situation They fall
on the bed and the remote button gets pressed

Various TV visuals appearing in quick succession of the
crane arm going up Sales graph going up rocket going up
Everything is goes up and we ending with the commentators
shouting
