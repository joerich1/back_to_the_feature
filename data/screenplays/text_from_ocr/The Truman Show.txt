THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY

A FOGGED MIRROR

Behind the fog we hear the sounds of a bathroom After a
long moment a hand wipes the condensation from the glass to
reveal the face of TRUMAN BURBANK He wears a sleeveless
Hanes undershirt and blue-stripe pajama bottoms behind him a
white glazed tiled bathroom wall It is immediately apparent
that we are viewing him through a two-way mirror

Truman expressionless studies his reflection in the mirror
For a long moment he does nothing He continues to look
impassively into the mirror for what becomes an uncomfortably
long time Still nothing Finally he speaks talking to
himself in the mirror as if participating in a TV interview

TRUMAN
personally I think the unconquered
south face is the only one worth

scalingof course its a 20000 foot
sheer wall of ice but then when did that
ever stop me beforeNaturally I

intend to make the ascent without the
benefit of oxygen but also without
crampons or even an ice pickrisks
(smug TV smiles)
sure Im aware of the risks-—-why else
do you think I would spend seven years as
an adjuster in a life insurance
company

MERYL (0OS)
Truman youre gonna be late

Truman resignedly opens the door of the cabinet and replaces
his shaving tackle It partially obscures the lens of the
hidden camera He closes the door and exits

INT KITCHEN MORNING

MERYL wearing a stylish robe sits at the kitchen table
sipping coffee On the table in front of her lies a parcel
TRUMAN enters and glances at the gift

TRUMAN
Whats that

MERYL
Its a surprise

TRUMAN unwraps the parcel - an expensive-looking set of
exercise sweats

MERYL
(eager for his response)
Well what do you think

TRUMAN
Theyre
(the merest hesitation)
perfect Thank you

Truman returns Meryls kiss
MERYL
(handing him the sweat top)

Try it on

Truman pulls the top over his head As he does so a closer
shot focuses on the manufacturers name

MERYL
I thought you could wear them when
you do your exercises
(afterthought)
Pre-shrunk And they breathe

EXT TRUMANS HOUSE DAY

Wearing a business suit briefcase in hand TRUMAN emerges
from his pleasant Victorian-inspired picket-fenced house
into an idyllic suburban street of similarly picturesque
homes A neighbor SPENCER is taking in trashcans
whistling a tune Spencer breaks off abruptly as Truman
approaches his car His license plate reads Seahaven - A
A Nice Place To Live

SPENCER
Morning Truman

TRUMAN
Morning Spencer And in case I dont
see you good afternoon good evening
and good night

Spencers dog PLUTO bounds happily over to Truman

TRUMAN
(petting the dog)
Hey Pluto

Truman exchanges a polite nod with the WASHINGTONs an
African-American family across the street MR WASHINGTON
is farewelled by his WIFE and CHILD

Truman is about to climb into his car when he is distracted
by a high-pitched whistling sound Suddenly a large
spherical glass object falls from the sky and lands with a
deafening crash on the street several yards from his car

The startled Truman looks to Spencer but he has abruptly
disappeared inside his house with Pluto Mrs Washington and
Washington Junior have also made themselves scarce

Truman investigates Amidst a sea of shattered glass are the
remains of a light mechanism

He looks around him but the street is deserted He checks
that all the surrounding street lights are accounted for
even though the fallen fixture is far larger He looks up
into the sky but there is no plane in sight With some

effort Truman picks up whats left of the crumpled light and
loads it into the trunk A label on the light fixture reads
SIRIUS (9 Canis Major) As he drives away we hear the
sound of his car radio

RADIO ANNOUNCER
Another glorious morning in Seahaven
folks

INTEXT TRUMANS CAR - SEAHAVEN DAY

TRUMAN makes his way along the streets of Seahaven past a
series of quaint pastel-shaded cottages

EXT SEAHAVEN ISLAND TOWNSHIP DAY

A high-angle reveals an anonymous mid-sized town built around
a small pretty bay A cluster of high-rise buildings stand
at the waters edge overlooking a marina Surrounding the
commercial center lie neatly arranged suburbs

EXT OCEANSIDE STREET DAY

Pausing at a traffic light along a seaside road TRUMAN looks
through a curious wooden arch to the beach and ocean beyond
The sight triggers a memory in his head

PLAYBACK -—- EXT LONG WIDE BEACH DAY

Unlike a conventional flashback the scene in his memory
appears to be playing on a television screen

FOUR-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN runs towards a bluff on the beach

The boys father KIRK late-thirties beer bottle in hand
flirts with TWO TEENAGE GIRLS at the shoreline Suddenly
the father remembers his son He looks anxiously around
The sight of the boy at the far end of the beach causes him
to drop his bottle in the sand and run to Truman

The boy is near the top of the cliff before his agitated
father comes within earshot

FATHER
(out of breath clutching his side)
Truman Truman Stop

Truman turns from his perch and waves happily down to his
father But the smile quickly vanishes when he registers the
anger and distress on his fathers face

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
FATHER
Come down now

His fathers unnatural anxiety makes the next bay even more
tantalizing The boy considers defying his father He puts
his hand on the rock above him to stretch up and sneak a peek
at the other side One good stretch would do it

FATHER
(reading Trumans mind enraged)
No

TRUMAN
Why Whats there

FATHER
(unconvincing)
Nothing Itsits dangerous
(trace of desperation)
Come down now Please

Truman is suddenly aware that the hundreds of other
BEACHGOERS have stopped their activities to stare at him
Reluctantly he starts to retrace his steps down the rocks
When he finally jumps to the sand his father embraces him
and leads him away

FATHER
I told you to stay close Dont ever
leave my sight again
(pause)
Youve got to know your limitations You

couldve fallen

INT TRUMANS CAR — DOWNTOWN SEAHAVEN MORNING -— PRESENT

Through his car window TRUMAN buys a cup of coffee from a
streetside VENDOR

VENDOR
How are ya Truman

TRUMAN
(placing his fingers to his pulse)
Vital signs are good

He pulls into a parking space and sips on the coffee As he
drinks he becomes aware of a school bell summoning children
to class in the adjacent Elementary School The image
prompts another childhood memory

PLAYBACK - INT SEAHAVEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL -— CLASSROOM DAY

Once again the flashback appears to be playing on a
television screen

SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits in the middle row of an Elementary
School classroom surrounded by twenty-or-so other well-
scrubbed uniformed YOUNGSTERS MARLON the boy next to
Truman is on his feet under the scrutiny of a kindly Norman
Rockwell-style SCHOOL MISTRESS

MISTRESS
What do you want to do when you grow up
Marlon

MARLON

I want to be an entrepreneur like my dad

SCHOOL MISTRESS
(impressed)
Tell the class what an entrepreneur
does Marlon

MARLON
He makes a lot of money Maam

SCHOOL MISTRESS
A good one does Marlon
(looking in her purse hamming it up)
Perhaps Ill be coming to you for a loan
one of these days

The CLASS titters Marlon sits down and winks to Truman

SCHOOL MISTRESS
What about you Truman

Truman rises to his feet gathering his nerve

TRUMAN
I want to be an explorer
(with reverence)
like Magellan

The School Mistress smiles benevolently

SCHOOL MISTRESS

(slightly condescending)
Im afraid no ones going to pay you to
do that Truman You might have to find
something a little more practical

(glancing to a pulldown wall

map behind her head)
Besides youre too late Theres

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
really nothing left to explore

The class roars with laughter as the crestfallen Truman takes
his seat

EXT PARKING LOT DAY -— PRESENT

TRUMAN briefcase in hand crosses from the parking lot to
the town square surrounded by similarly suited briefcase-
toting OFFICE WORKERS

EXT DOWNTOWN SEAHAVEN DAY

TRUMAN walks briskly down the bustling city street A snarl
of taxis buses and COMMUTER traffic A STREET VENDOR
thrusts a pretzel under Trumans nose a CAREER WOMAN tries
to catch his eye

Truman stops at a kiosk and buys a newspaper - THE ISLAND
TIMES

VENDOR
Is that all for you Truman

TRUMAN
Thats all Thanks Errol

Other CUSTOMERS also purchase the morning paper Tucking his
copy under his arm Truman selects a glossy magazine from a
rack quickly flicking through the pages

Glancing in the direction of the NEWSPAPER VENDOR and finding
him busy with another CUSTOMER Truman deftly tears a portion
of the open page and pockets the cutting He hastily
replaces the magazine and departs

As Truman hurries away the vendor exits the kiosk and picks
up the magazine instantly turning to the torn page It isa
cosmetics advertisement with the MODELS NOSE missing
However the vendor makes no effort to confront Truman
almost as if he were expecting it

EXT SEAHAVEN LIFE AND ACCIDENT INC DAY

Truman passes along a row of shops and offices finally
entering a building that proudly proclaims Seahaven Life and
Accident Inc above the entrance He has evidently taken
his teachers advice

INT INSURANCE COMPANY —- SEAHAVEN LIFE AND ACCIDENT INC DAY

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
In a cramped cluttered cubicle TRUMAN talks on the telephone

TRUMAN
(into receiver)

okay okay lets call it what it

insurance is death insuranceyouve
just got to ask yourself two questions
one in the event of your death will

two do you care

A CLERK drops a large reference book on Trumans desk
Truman checks the spine -—- MARITIME ACCIDENTS

TRUMAN
(into receiver)
Hold on will you
(to Clerk referring to the book)
This is no good Lumps all maritime
accidents together I need drownings as
a separate category

The Clerk shrugs returns the book to his cart and continues
his rounds

TRUMAN
(returning to his call)
just think about what Ive been saying
and let mehello

The person on the other end has hung up With an apathetic
shrug Truman replaces the receiver He looks over his
shoulder and places another call

TRUMAN
(lowering his voice)
Can you connect me with directory
inquiries in Fiji

A CO-WORKER suddenly pokes his head over the neighboring cubicle

CO-WORKER
What do you know Truman

TRUMAN
(embarrassed mouthing the word)
-—-Cant talk
(waving off his neighbor pretending
to be on a business call)
Im sorry maam If hes in a coma
hes probably uninsurable

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
The Co-Worker disappears back into his own cubicle

TRUMAN
(lowering his voice again)
Hello operatoryes FijiDo you have
a listing for a Lauren Garland
(pause)
nothing listedwhat about a Sylvia
GarlandS for Sylvianothing

Okay thanks

The disconsolate Truman replaces the receiver Other
INSURANCE AGENTS are heading to lunch Truman puts on his
jacket and follows them to the elevators

INT LOCAL ITALIAN DELI LUNCHTIME

Behind a deli counter TYRONE fifties is having his hair
brushed by a YOUNG MAN The man fusses one final time then
swiftly departs through a rear door just as TRUMAN enters

the store Tyrone has anticipated Trumans order and has
already begun preparing a meatball and mozzarella sandwich on
an Italian roll Truman gazes at the sandwich skillfully
under construction pained by his own predictability

TYRONE
(nauseatingly cheerful)
Hows it going Truman

TRUMAN
(deadpan)
Not bad I just won the State Lottery

TYRONE
(not listening to Trumans reply)
Good Good

TRUMAN
Tyrone what if I said I didnt want
meatball today

TYRONE
(not missing a beat passing
Truman his wrapped sandwich)
Id ask for identification

Truman forces a half-smile and exits

TYRONE
See you tomorrow Truman

TRUMAN
You can count on it

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
EXT SECLUDED PARK DAY

TRUMAN eats lunch alone at a small out-of-the-way park

dominated by a gazebo From his briefcase he pulls out an
old hardcovered book To The Ends Of The Earth - The Age Of
Exploration He reads to himself his sandwich uneaten

beside him Struck by a particular passage he reads aloud

TRUMAN
With a mutiny but half-repressed and
starvation imminent he pressed southward
till he found the long-hoped-for
straits

Truman is interrupted by a TRANSIENT in a wheelchair It is
the mans sneakers Truman notices first over the top of his
book - they are distinctively initialed TS Still under
the spell of the account of Magellan he hands the grateful
man his sandwich

INT A CONFERENCE ROOM SOMEWHERE DAY

A group of a dozen MEN and WOMEN of varying ages sit around a
circular conference table in a sterile windowless meeting room
All stare at a single telephone placed in the center of the
table anticipating a call On cue the phone rings and one of
the men after waiting for the second ring picks up

MAN
HelloIm sorry Ive got more than
enough life insurance

He hangs up After a moment the phone rings again

INT INSURANCE COMPANY DAY
TRUMAN sits at his desk making a cold call

TRUMA
(into receiver)

this isnt about insurance this is
about the great variable - when will
death occur Could be a week a month a
year Could happen todayA sunbather
minding his own business gets stabbed in
the heart by the tip of a runaway beach
umbrella No way you can guard against
that kind of thing no way at all

The prospect on the other end unimpressed with Trumans

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
pitch hangs up Trumans supervisor LAWRENCE younger than
Truman by several years sharper suit sharper haircut
appears around the corner of the cubicle

LAWRENCE
(handing Truman some
documentation)
Hey Burbank Ive got a prospect in
Welles Park I need you to close

Trumans face falls He stares out of his third floor window
at the hazy skyline of a nearby island across the bay

TRUMAN
(referring to the island)
Welles Park on Harbor Island

LAWRENCE
(sarcastic)
You know another one

TRUMAN
I cant do it
(searching for a plausible
excuse)
--Ive got an appointment--er dentist

LAWRENCE

(insistent)
Youll lose a lot more than your teeth if
you dont meet your quota Burbank

(the threat in his voice

is unmistakable)
Theyre making cutbacks at the end of the
month You need this

(as he exits the cubicle)
Besides a half hour across the bay Sea
air Do you good

Truman sinks back into his seat and stares out at the distant
skyline The buildings appear very still Truman picks up a
photo of his wife Meryl deposits it in his briefcase and
exits

EXT SEAHAVEN DAY

Trumans car heads out of the city on its way to the ferry

INT SEAHAVEN FERRY TERMINAL DAY

TRUMAN exits his car Mustering all his nerve he marches
into the Seahaven terminal and buys a token for the ferry

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
Out of his hearing TWO FERRY WORKERS observe Trumans
agitated behavior

FERRY WORKER 1
I got a feeling this is the day

FERRY WORKER 2
No way I say he makes it through the
turnstiles but he never gets on

The two men shake on the wager Unaware of the scrutiny
Truman passes through the turnstiles with a herd of TOURISTS
and COMMUTERS He makes his way across the terminal but
abruptly pulls up at the gangway

As the other PASSENGERS impatiently brush past him onto the
boat Truman remains frozen to the spot mesmerized by the
scummy water rising and falling beneath the dock It
triggers a memory in his head

PLAYBACK - EXT SEAHAVEN HARBOR DAY

As always the flashback appears to play on a television
screen

SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN wearing a lifejacket sits alongside
his father KIRK in a small sailing dinghy sailing into a
stiff breeze

A second sail boat circles them We observe the father and
son from an angle atop the mast of the neighboring vessel

TRUMAN
(shouting above the wind)
Lets go further daddy Lets go
further

KIRK
(shouting back)
Its getting rough Truman

TRUMAN
(entreating his father)
Please
Kirk shakes his head ruefully and indulges his son by heading

towards the gathering storm clouds on the horizon

INT SEAHAVEN FERRY TERMINAL DAY -— PRESENT

Truman turns and begins to fight his way back against the tide of

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
PASSENGERS boarding the ferry emerging back onto the street
gasping for air The FERRY WORKERS settle their wager

EXT ROADWAY ADJACENT TO THE FERRY TERMINAL DAY

TRUMAN stands at a payphone By stretching the payphones
receiver cord as far as it will go he is just able to reach
his arm and leg into the drivers door of his car He
punctuates his conversation with blasts on the cars horn
while revving the cars engine with his outstretched foot
The few passing MOTORISTS and PEDESTRIANS regard Truman
curiously

TRUMAN

(shouting into phone)
--I tell you the traffics insane

(blasting his horn several

times to imitate the sound of

of gridlock)
Ill never make the ferry in time
What can I do--whatLawrence I cant
hear you

Truman hangs up the phone

INT TRUMANS CAR DAY

On his way home a large DETOUR sign forces him onto a
secondary road

INT TRUMANS CAR — PARKLAND SEAHAVEN DAY

TRUMAN drives along a winding road through parkland He

pulls up at a red light - no other traffic around His
attention is caught by an attractive YOUNG WOMAN sitting on
a park bench not far from the intersection She is being

taunted by TWO YOUNG THUGS She attempts to ignore the
youths by concentrating on the book on her lap

YOUTH 1
(to woman)
You wanna read to me
His companion smirks
YOUTH 1
(more insistent)

You wanna read to me

The boy reaches over and snatches the novel from her grasp

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
YOUTH 2
(menacing)
My friend asked you a question

The woman picks up her bag in a reflex and holds it to her
She looks about for assistance briefly catching Trumans eye
The youths also look in Trumans direction staring him down

WOMAN
(reaching for the book)
Please

The boy returns the book to the woman but before doing so
rips out the last page from the novel and stuffs it in his
shirt pocket

YOUTH 2
Now youre gonna have to ask me how
it ends

One of the youths grabs the woman dragging her toward the
surrounding woods

YOUTH 1
Were gonna tell you how it ends baby

WOMAN
Help Please help

As they drag her towards the undergrowth Truman horrified
half gets out of the car - fearful of his own safety as much
as the womans Truman shouts to the youths his voice
cracking with fear

TRUMAN
Hey Let her go

A huge truck suddenly appears behind Trumans car its horn
blasting the DRIVER hurling abuse Truman hesitates as the
youths drag the woman into the bushes conflicted over
whether or not to help The truck driver keeps his hand on
the horn Truman retreats back into his car and reluctantly
drives on

EXT PARKLAND — WOODS DAY
Trumans car safely out of sight the YOUTHS promptly release
the YOUNG WOMAN She calmly brushes herself off no longer

afraid The young men no longer angry retrieve her bag

WOMAN
Thanks

The threesome walks back towards the roadway as if life-long
friends

WOMAN
(pondering the incident)
He did nothing

YOUTH 1
(shrugs suddenly more couth)
Physical violence paralyzes him Always has

EXT TRUMANS HOUSE —- DUSK

Beyond the pretty picket fence at the end of the property
flows a busy highway

TRUMAN is mowing the lawn From his expression it would seem
that hes still reflecting on his inaction in the park He
switches off the mower and leans on the handle

He is distracted by the arrival of his wife MERYL exiting
the house She wears a nurses uniform and carries a curious
metal device attached to a card board backing She kisses
Truman affectionately on the cheek

MERYL
Hi honey Look at this
(proudly referring to the device)
Its a Chefs-Mate Dicer slicer and
peeler in one Never needs sharpening
Dishwasher safe

TRUMAN
Gee thats great

Looking over Trumans shoulder Meryl notices a small uncut
patch of grass missed by Truman in one of his passes

MERYL
(referring to the uncut grass)
You missed a section

Meryl enters the house Truman restarts the lawnmower and
obediently pushes it towards the offending patch of lawn As
the mower brushes up against the unconforming blades of
grass Truman pulls back abruptly He checks the kitchen
window for Meryl and wheels the mower away leaving the patch
uncut

INT TRUMANS HOUSE — LIVING ROOM NIGHT

MERYL is removing the cap of her nurses uniform when TRUMAN

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
enters

TRUMAN
How did it go today

MERYL
(matter-of-fact)
A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw
(shrug)
We got three of his fingers back on

Truman retrieves a bucket of golf balls and a golf club from
behind the door

MERYL
(disappointed at the sight of
the golf equipment)
I was hoping we could have a special
evening

TRUMAN
I wont be late

MERYL
(sensing something odd in his
demeanor)
Did something happen today

Truman turns to her too sharply his guilt showing

TRUMAN
What could happen

Truman exits

EXT UNFINISHED BRIDGE NIGHT

A half-constructed bridge paved but unmarked ends abruptly
in mid-air - reinforcing steel protruding from the concrete
TRUMAN stands at the end of the unfinished bridge with
MARLON thirties a well-filled physique Marlon drinks beer
from a can while Truman addresses a teed-up golf ball witha
number three wood The headlights of their two parked cars
light the cement fairway Their target is a sign at the
far end of the bridge proclaiming THE SEAHAVEN CAUSEWAY —-
Linking Seahaven Island With The Rest Of The World - Your Tax
Dollars At Work - an upturned plastic cone at the foot of
the sign is the hole

Truman winds up and swings making a healthy contact with the
ball The ball arches away into the night sky From a new
angle we see the ball take a huge hop on the outside lane of
the abandoned freeway and continue down the asphalt beyond

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
the sign

Marlon tosses Truman another off-white ball from a bucket of
badly scarred golf balls Truman sets the ball up on the
makeshift tee area and launches himself into his second shot
With a slight fade the second ball carries even further than
the first

MARLON
Whose nuts were those

Truman hands Marlon their sole golf club without comment
Marlon tees up a ball of his own He uses orange golf balls

TRUMAN
Im thinking of getting out Marlon

MARLON
(mild interest only)
Yeah Outta what

TRUMAN
Outta my job outta Seahaven off this
islandout

Marlon takes a practice swing

MARLON
Outta your job What the hells wrong
with your job You gotta great job You
gotta desk job Id kill for a desk job

Marlon addresses the ball and swings - a sweeping hook shot
that bounces off the freeway and into the water hazard

MARLON

(annoyed by the errant tee shot)
Sonofabitch

(still looking in the

direction of his ball)
Try stocking vending machines for a
living My biggest decision of the day
is whether the Almond Joys look better
next to the Snickers or the Baby Ruths

Truman selects another M ball from the bucket and tosses it
to Marlon

TRUMAN
(adamant)
Havent you ever gotten itchy feet

Overcompensating with his second shot Marlon slices the ball in
the other direction A lucky bounce keeps it on the green

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
The ball rolls in the direction of the upturned cone

MARLON
(skeptical picking up his beer)
Where is there to go

Truman gulps his beer as he prepares his answer

TRUMAN
(unable to disguise his
reverence)
Fiji

Marlon considers Trumans suggestion as he sips his beer

MARLON
(impressed)
Fiji Where the hell is Fiji exactly
Near Florida You cant drive there
can you

Truman picks up a golf ball to demonstrate He points to a
dimple on his make-shift globe

TRUMAN

See here this is us

(sliding his finger around

the other side of the ball)
All the way round here Fiji You cant
get any further away before you start
coming back

(tossing the world in his

hand warming to his subject)
Yknow there are still islands in Fiji
where no human has ever set foot

MARLON
(still dubious)
So when are you leaving

TRUMAN
Its not that simple Takes money
planning You cant just up and go
(heading off Marlons skepticism)
Oh Im going to do it dont worry about

that Ive just got to move slow Pick
my moment Bonus times just around the
corner Soon as I finish the

MARLON
Nursery

TRUMAN
Spare room - I can start thinking about

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
selling upand Ill be gone Up and
away on that big steel bird

(as if to convince himself)
Im going dont you worry about that

Marlon nods even though the concept of taking flight is
beyond his imagination

MARLON
I never knew anybody who wanted to leave
Seahaven
An awkward moment Truman once again not so sure of himself

INT A DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE NIGHT

A MAN looks up sharply He stares into camera CHRISTOF late
fifties - a vitality in his eyes that belies his years A news
anchor-style earpiece disappears down the neck of his suit

EXT BRIDGE NIGHT

TRUMAN and MARLON wander along the empty bridge retrieving
the golf balls

Marlon goes to say something to the disconsolate Truman but
is momentarily distracted He raises his hand to his ear
Truman places another of the balls in the bucket

MARLON
Truman you know I did think about
moving away one time

TRUMAN
(interest piqued)
Yeah what happened

MARLON
I figured whats the point I knew Id
just be taking my problems with me Once

the kids came along it made me look at
Seahaven with new eyes
(gazing out at the lights of
Seahaven)
I realized what the hell could be better
than this
(putting a hand on Trumans
shoulder)
Im telling you What you really need is
someone to carry on the Burbank name

TRUMAN

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
You think so

MARLON
Trust me

Marlon picks up the last ball at the mouth of the upturned
cone The ball is white

MARLON
(checking the ball)
You win
They approach Trumans car Truman opens the trunk to

deposit their humble golfing equipment Inside are the
remains of the fallen light fixture

TRUMAN
(referring to the light)
You really think it couldve dropped off
an airliner

MARLON
(unimpressed)
Sure Its halogen Shame it didnt hit
you — you couldve sued

(quickly changing the subject)
You coming for a drink

TRUMAN
I cant tonight

INT LIGHTHOUSE NIGHT

From the POV of the lighthouses lantern room we observe
TRUMAN sitting on the beach staring out to sea

Closer on Truman He has a portable tape recorder slung over
his shoulder and points a corded microphone at the surf We
watch Trumans impassive face as he makes the recording of
the lapping waves The lamp from the lighthouse occasionally
falls upon Truman

PLAYBACK —- EXT OCEAN DAY

As always the flashback appears to play on a television screen
The sky is black with storm clouds Gale force winds lash

rain into the faces of SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN and his father
KIRK As Kirk stands up to get his hearings a freak gust of

wind catches the sail The boom whips across the stern and
strikes Kirk flush in the head knocking his overboard

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
Truman wearing the sole lifejacket desperately reaches for
his father He momentarily has hold of his fathers hand
when Kirk is abruptly dragged beneath the surface

TRUMAN
(crying out)

His cries go unanswered Seven-year-old Truman finds himself
alone - the storm abruptly passed the wind suddenly dropped
the water stilled

The frightened Truman examines the ring he holds in his open
hand - his fathers ring - wrenched from his finger in
Trumans fight to keep him afloat

EXT BEACH NIGHT -— PRESENT

A close up of TRUMAN from KIRKS RING that Truman now wears
Then from the lighthouse POV we observe Truman get to his

feet and walk towards the dark water He stands at the
waters edge

TRUMAN
(shouting at the surf)
Im sorry Dad Im sorry

As if in reply a tongue of lightning flashes across the
distant skyline followed by a growl of thunder

INT A LIVING ROOM SOMEWHERE NIGHT

TWO OLD WOMEN seventies sit beside each other on a sofa
looking directly into camera as they talk

OLD WOMAN 1
(playing amateur psychiatrist)
It left him with more than his obvious
fear of the water

OLD WOMAN 2
He was never the same curious little
boy again

OLD WOMAN 1

Half the women I know named their
children after him

EXT BEACH PARKING LOT NIGHT

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
TRUMAN is forced to leg it through a sudden rain shower to
his car

From Trumans point-of-view the shower appears quite normal
However viewed from a distance we see that the shower is
extremely localized encircling only him as if a small cloud
is directly above his head tracking his progress

As Truman crosses the parking lot the shower crosses with
him Sensing something amiss Truman dances back and forth
across the street intrigued by the curious phenomenon He
hums a few bars of Singin In The Rain

The rain becomes heavier covering a wider area Truman runs
the remaining distance to his car

INT TRUMANS HOUSE — NURSERY NIGHT

The drenched TRUMAN enters to find MERYL in the unfinished
nursery comparing wallpaper samples Meryl wears a robe a
glimpse of black negligee beneath

MERYL
Where have you been

TRUMAN
(wringing out his jacket)
Ive been thinking-—

MERYL
(rolling her eyes)
Oh God
TRUMAN

(ignoring the reception)
--I figure we could scrape together
eight thousand

MERYL
(exasperated)
Every time you and Marlon--

TRUMAN
—-We could bum around the world for a
year on that

MERYL
And then what Truman Wed be back to
where we were five years ago Youre

talking like a teenager

EXT TRUMANS STREET DAWN
There is something peculiar about the way the sun rises over
Seahaven Island - the light appears in an arc thats slightly
too perfect and well-defined

INT TRUMANS BEDROOM MORNING

In front of his bedroom window TRUMAN wearing his new
sweats performs an exercise routine of his own invention

He counts off the exercises to himself - cheating as he does
so He counts five leg-lifts for every two he completes
TRUMAN
-—-Five
(two leg-lifts later)
Thenfifteentwo more makes twenty

INT A BEDROOM SOMEWHERE MORNING

A middle-aged MARRIED COUPLE in identical matching sweats
repeat the same eccentric exercises in perfect sync as if
they were in a class led by Truman

EXT CAR DAY

TRUMAN climbs into the car and switches on the radio He drives
down the street

RADIO ANNOUNCER
Another glorious morning in Seahaven folks

Dont forget to buckle up--

Truman mutters to himself as is his custom

EXT DOWNTOWN SEAHAVEN DAY

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
TRUMAN emerges from the parking lot and as usual stops at the
newspaper stand He picks up a glossy magazine and flips
through the cosmetic ads surreptitiously tearing a pair of
EYES from one of the pages He returns the magazine to the
rack As usual the NEWSPAPER VENDOR fails to intervene
Truman begins his daily pilgrimage to work through the rush
hour pedestrian traffic

As he enters the street leading to his office he glimpses a
HOMELESS MAN reflected in the window of a parked car

Truman spellbound by the man suddenly wheels around to face
him The Homeless Man late-fifties more well-groomed and
well-fed than the average vagrant has a serene smile on his

face

The Homeless Man places his hand ever so gently on Trumans

cheek Truman makes no effort to withdraw He is transfixed
by the mans eyes He appears to recognize him
TRUMAN
(almost to himself mouthing
the word)
Dad

Suddenly an ELEGANT WOMAN SHOPPER walking a small WIENER DOG
and a BUSINESS EXECUTIVE carrying a briefcase walking in
opposite directions along the sidewalk grab the Homeless
Man One under each arm lifting the Homeless Man off the
ground they start to whisk the bewildered derelict down the
street

TRUMAN
(calling out)
Stop Stop

Truman begins to give chase However the shopper and the
businessman are surprisingly fleet-footed Even more
surprising as Truman embarks on the pursuit is the behavior
of the PEDESTRIANS and COMMUTERS They appear to part for
the fleeing trio then close ranks in front of him Is it
accidental or are the pedestrians working together running
interference

TRUMAN
(shouting at the pedestrians)
Outta the way Outta the way

They are escaping

Truman finally breaks through the pack bowling over several
of the pedestrians in the process Just as he gets within
reach of the shopper and the businessman a bus suddenly
screeches to a halt beside the abductors doors already open
The Woman Shopper and the Executive bundle the Homeless Man

onto the bus Truman lurches after them but he is met by
the bus doors closing sharply in his face

TRUMAN
(to BUS DRIVER)
Hey stop Stop the bus

Truman thumps against the doors but the BUS DRIVER ignores
his cries and the bus roars away The other PASSENGERS in
the bus apparently oblivious to the incident keeps staring
straight ahead

Truman continues to give chase when a taxi appears out of
nowhere and cuts in front of him blocking his path When he
recovers the bus has disappeared The mysterious crowd of
pedestrians has also dissolved as if it never existed

Retracing his steps head reeling wondering if the could have
imagined the whole incident Truman discovers that the Woman
Shopper has left her WIENER DOG behind The dog wanders
aimlessly on the pavement its leash trailing behind it

INT MOTHERS HOUSE DAY

TRUMAN paces impatiently in the living room of his Mothers
cramped fussy doilyed little house full of Burbank family
memorabilia - a cluster of framed photographs is dominated by
one of his FATHER trimmed with a black ribbon A toilet
flushes and Trumans MOTHER finally emerges from the next
room

She presents something of a contradiction Although she
walks with the aid of a walker she is actually a well-
preserved sixty She wears a glamorous nightgown and a full
head of bleached-blonde hair

TRUMAN
(kissing Mother on the cheek)
How are you Mother

MOTHER
Well I made it through another night

TRUMAN
Hows your hip

MOTHER
Oh just so

Truman supports Mother

MOTHER

TRUMAN
(exasperated)
I spend half my life out in the sun

MOTHER
I feel certain my condition runs in the
family
(putting the back of her hand
dramatically over her forehead)
Cant this wait dear

He kneels beside her

TRUMAN
No Im afraid it cant

Truman takes a deep breath as he prepares to give her the news
TRUMAN
I know this is going to sound insane
Mother butI saw Dad today on

Lancaster Circle Hes alive

Mother smiles condescendingly

MOTHER
It doesnt sound insane Truman I swear
I see him ten times a week--in a hundred
faces I almost hugged a perfect stranger

in the salon last Thursday

TRUMAN
It was Dad I swear dressed like a
homeless man And you know what else was
really strange A businessman and a
woman with a little dog appeared from
nowhere and forced him onto a bus

MOTHER
About time they started cleaning up the

TRUMAN
(already doubting himself)
Im telling you if it wasnt him it was
his twin Did Dad have a brother

MOTHER
You know he was an only child like you
(placing a comforting arm
around him)
I know how bad you feel about what
happened--sailing into that storm But I
dont blame you Truman I never have

Mother kisses Truman on the cheek

MOTHER
(referring to her platinum
blonde hair)
I was thinking about going lighter What
do you think

Truman regards his Mother Her hair is already impossibly blonde

INT TRUMANS BASEMENT DUSK

The basement is cluttered with junk - ships in bottles a
train track without trains an oxygen mask a stringless
guitar many abandoned projects The basement is dimly lit
by a single naked bulb TRUMAN looks over his shoulder
before opening a large walk-in cupboard On the cupboard
door is a wall map of the Pacific Ocean - the Fiji Islands
are carefully circled Amongst the many tools and household
implements inside the cupboard is a trunk under a dusty
canvas sheet He pulls the trunk into the room unfastens
the lock and opens the lid

Inside mementoes from his youth A HOW TO SAIL book a
stack of GREAT EXPLORERS magazines and beneath it all a
garment in a drycleaning bag Truman carefully lifts up the
plastic to reveal a young womans cardigan sweater He puts
the cardigan to his nose and takes in its scent

Footsteps Truman hastily drops the cardigan in the trunk

MERYL

mower on the basement floor)
Fixing the mower

Meryls response takes the wind out of Trumans sails

TRUMAN
What did you want

MERYL
I made macaroni

TRUMAN
Im not hungry

Meryl nods not at all convinced
MERYL
We really ought to toss that mower out

Get one of those new Elk Rotaries

Truman does not reply After an uncomfortable pause she
turns back up the stairs

Truman waits a moment before re-opening the trunk He
removes the cardigan and holds it up reminiscing

The excited and apprehensive Truman runs with her although he
is unsure exactly who or what they are running from

The further they get from the campus the higher wider and
less effective the coverage of the scene - some camera angles
are even partially obscured

TRUMAN and LAUREN eventually cross an empty highway on the edge
of town

They run over the dunes onto a strangely deserted beach and
down to the waters edge under a hyper-real full moon

wading out into the inviting water without another thought
Truman stares down transfixed by the shimmering water

LAUREN

Its beautiful What are you waiting for

Lauren suddenly stops splashing

LAUREN
Thats right Oh God Im sorry

She wades out of the water

As we return to Trumans reminiscence TRUMAN and SYLVIA (as

traces the outline of her nose with his finger at the same
time inhaling her scent Sylvia looks nervously around her
Truman goes to say something but Sylvia hushes him

SYLVIA

Suddenly a cars headlights come bouncing over the dunes
The car roars across the beach towards the couple

The car skids to a stop and a large MAN 40ish with a shock of

INT BASEMENT NIGHT

TRUMAN turns his attention to the framed photograph of Meryl

that he carries everywhere Hidden behind her photo is a
composite picture of Sylvia which Truman has constructed by
pasting together individual facial features - nose mouth ears
chin hair - gathered presumably from womens magazines He

attempts to put the jigsaw puzzle together - although he has
particular difficulty finding a pair of eyes that match

From his pocket he takes a recent collection of eyes which
like a detective working on an identikit picture he tries to
match They are still not quite right

a tape that has worn out Truman perplexed looks at the

radio and pushes buttons in an attempt to find another
station He finds one

FEMALE VOICE

Truman glances up at the street signs along his route and
finds that they correspond exactly with the streets quoted
on the radio Distracted he almost bowls over an OLD LADY
on a crosswalk

MALE VOICE
(from radio)
God he almost hit Marilyn Hes on
the move again passing the library

Truman readjusts the radio as it starts to fade out
Suddenly there is a piercing blast of feedback He looks up
and as far as the eye can see every PEDESTRIAN MOTORIST
and SHOPKEEPER along the street suddenly winces in pain and
holds their right ear at exactly the same moment

Somethings wrong Change frequencies

Truman tries to pick up the channel once again but without
success

The room is empty save for a large reel-to-reel tape recorder
on the teachers desk playing a continuous tape of childrens
voices The recorder is attached to speakers on tall stands
facing the ventilation ducts Truman stares at the machine
in disbelief

TRUMAN still lost in thought exits the school He stops at
the newsstand and picks up a magazine to resume his ritual
search but his heart is not in it He replaces the magazine

Truman starts his trek to work pausing to stare at his

EXT DOWNTOWN STREET DAY

Wandering down the bustling street TRUMAN suddenly bolts
into a building at random

INT OFFICE BUILDING DAY

An imposing office building clad in the kind of reflective
glass that shields its occupants from the world - a building
Truman passes every day A steady stream of EMPLOYEES and
VISITORS enter and exit the buildings high-ceilinged lobby
past an intimidating security desk manned by TWO UNIFORMED
GUARDS Beyond security are banks of elevators ferrying
executives clerical staff and delivery personnel to and from
their floors of business

Truman abruptly enters reception and strides confidently
past the security desk trying to look as if he belongs

SECURITY GUARD 1

TRUMAN

building directory)
I have an appointment at erGable
Enterprises

SECURITY GUARD 1
They went bust

The second Security Guard is rising from his seat to block
Trumans path to the elevators but Truman reads his mind and
makes a dash for it - into one of the elevators

A YOUNG WOMAN in the elevator looks in horror at Truman - the
cause of her concern all too apparent Looking beyond the
Woman Truman discovers that there is no back to the elevator
car The PEOPLE Truman has just witnessed entering other
elevators are milling around a refreshment table primping or
sitting on folding chairs Gradually they all turn to gape
at Truman who in turn stares back appalled Trumans view
is abruptly blocked as a rear panel is hastily attached to
the elevator A Security Guard pulls Truman from the car

TRUMAN

sense of it the guards drag him away

Youve got to leave

The Guards frog-march Truman out of the facade towards an
Emergency Exit

TRUMAN

Back on the street TRUMAN feels the eyes of the PEDESTRIANS

Is he simply drawing attention to himself by his behavior
Truman wheels around trying to make eye contact with passersby
They shy away He continues to run down the street

Finally Truman finds himself standing in front of the
window of an electronics store staring at his own face ona

EXT CLIFFTOP — DUSK

Hand-over-hand TRUMAN climbs the cliff he once scaled as a
seven-year-old Finally he sits on the clifftop staring
out at the view his father had been so desperate for him not
to see twenty-six years earlier However the deserted bay
beyond is identical to its neighbor MARLON laboring

INT LIVING ROOM — TRUMANS HOUSE NIGHT

Truman sits cramped on his sofa Pulling wider we discover
the cause of his discomfort He is sandwiched between MERYL
on one side and MOTHER on the other Mother the family
historian a stack of photograph albums at her feet turns
the pages of the album on Trumans lap

TRUMAN
We ought to be getting you back Mother

MOTHER
Hold on a minute dear

(pointing out a photo in the album)
Heres us at Mount Rushmore You
remember Truman--when Dad was still with
us - that was quite a drive You slept
all the way there

TRUMAN
(taking an interest in the
monument )
It looks so small

MOTHER
(quickly turning the page)
Things always do--when you look back

Mother skips several pages in the album finally stopping at
a spread of wedding photos

MERYL

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
Look Truman theres my cousin Errol
putting the bouquet down his pants - it
was the happiest day of our lives

MOTHER
(referring to Meryl)
Didnt she look beautiful Truman She
still does

Mother turns to a blank page in the album

MOTHER
And theres plenty of room for baby
photos Id like to hold a grandchild
in my arms-——
(dabbing her eye with a handkerchief)
—-before I go

Meryl rises from the sofa and helps Mother to her walker

MERYL
Ill take you home Angela
(referring to the album)
Why dont you leave those with us for
a while

TRUMAN
(kissing his emotional mother)
Good night Mother

MERYL
(a wink to Truman)
See you in a minute sweetheart

Meryl departs with Mother Left alone in the living room
Truman slumps back down onto the sofa and switches on the
television set - an old-fashioned model with rabbit-ears
He idly studies the photograph album as an over-earnest
television HOST announces the upcoming program

TV HOST
—-Tonights golden-oldies is the
enduring much-loved classic Show Me
The Way To Go Home A hymn of praise
to small-town life where we learn that
you dont have to leave home to
discover what the world is all about
and that no one is poor who has
friends

However when we turn our attention away from the
television we find that Truman is peering intently ata
wedding photograph of Meryl and himself taking their vows in
a civil ceremony in a beachside gazebo Under the scrutiny

of a magnifying glass he discovers that Meryl has her
fingers crossed

INT A LIVING ROOM SOMEWHERE NIGHT

The TWO LADIES sit on their sofa a rug across their
knees sipping a night cap of hot chocolate They stare into
camera

OLD LADY 1
Remember at the wedding - that dog

OLD LADY 2
Started howling when they took their vows

OLD LADY 1
And the plastic horseshoe fell off when
they cut the cake

OLD LADY 2
(shaking her head ruefully)
They never had a chance

INT KITCHEN MORNING

TRUMAN dressed casually in weekend attire is at the stove
preparing an omelette MERYL hurries into the kitchen in her
nurses uniform She gulps down a cup of coffee and reaches
for her nurses cap

However she still has time to adjust the position of a pack of
FiberCon Cereal - squaring it a little more to camera

TRUMA
I have to talk with you
(looking about suspicious)
But not here Lets go for a walk

MERYL
(kissing him on the cheek)

Trumans eyes widen Meryl adjusts her hat in the mirror

MERYL
That buildings near yours Imagine if
youd been in there for some reason It

Truman lost in thought picks up the scalding frying pan with
his bare hand Letting out a howl of pain he drops the pan

TRUMAN
Arrah

MERYL
Oh my God

TRUMAN

What do I do

MERYL
I dont know--

ira

TRUMAN
—-youre a nurse arent you

MERYL
Put some butter on it--or ice

She looks up the kitchen clock

MERYL
(hurrying out the door)
Oh look at the time

Truman stares after her the pain of his hand forgotten for the
moment He watches Meryl ride her bicycle down the driveway
Truman exits the house

EXT SEAHAVEN STREETHOSPITALPARKING LOT DAY

Riding a bicycle of his own TRUMAN follows MERYL to work
staying a safe distance back He watches her enter the
hospital

INT HOSPITAL DAY

TRUMAN makes his way along various corridors All seems as
it should - DOCTORS confer with NURSING STAFF and PATIENTS
gurneys are wheeled about with their PASSENGERS looking
suitably traumatized Truman approaches a NURSING SISTER

TRUMAN

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary

The nurse walks off disappearing through a set of doors
Truman hesitates before following her

INT VARIOUS HOSPITAL CORRIDORS DAY

The NURSE walks briskly - fewer people about TRUMAN
discreetly following behind The nurse breaks into a jog

Truman hurries to keep up with her - dodging around gurneys
JANITORS mopping floors

INT OUTSIDE OPERATING THEATRE DAY

The NURSE hastily scrubbed and gowned enters the theatre TRUMAN
hesitates but dares not enter He grabs a mask of his own

Looking through the glass window in the operating theatre
door he sees the YOUNG WOMAN (seen in the hastily fixed
elevator car the day before) lying on the operating table a
blood-soaked bandage covering her left leg MERYL wearing a
surgical gown and mask assists the SURGEON The SISTER
hovers nervously in the background

SURGEON
Scalpel

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
Meryl very slowly selects a scalpel from a tray of instruments
and awkwardly hands it to the surgeon

SURGEON
Im now making my primary incision just
above the left knee

The patients eyes blink open in horror The ANESTHETIST
steps in Trumans view before he can get a good look
Suddenly a SECURITY GUARD appears beside Truman and takes
him by the arm

SECURITY GUARD
(referring to the operation)
This isnt gonna be pretty Unless
youre family of the patient Ill have
to ask you to leave

TRUMAN
No problem I dont want to cause any
trouble

INT TRAVEL AGENCY DAY

TRUMAN takes a seat at the only desk in an empty travel
agency The travel brochures and posters that adorn the
walls all feature destinations that bear a striking
similarity to picturesque Seahaven Another poster spells
out the dangers of travel - TRAVELLERS BEWARE - Terrorists
Disease Wild Animals Street Gangs A female TRAVEL AGENT
enters from a rear door

AGENT

EXT CITY STREET DAY

Emerging onto the street TRUMAN looks across to the building
which he entered the previous day It is now cordoned off
with police tape after the elevator disaster Flowers have
been laid at the doorway

EXT GREYHOUND BUS STATION DAY

A Greyhound Bus bound for CHICAGO according to its
destination sign sits idling at the stop Just as a burly
SUPERVISOR is about to wave the bus on its way TRUMAN dashes
into the station

BUS DRIVER
Last call for Chicago

Truman jumps onto the bus behind the last boarding passenger
—- a YOUNG SOLDIER

TRUMAN
(to the Bus Driver as he
boards the bus)
Windy City here we come

INT GREYHOUND BUS DAY

TRUMAN takes a seat by a window An awkward silence descends
over the bus The other passengers - a MOTHER with a
restless CHILD several TOURISTS an OLD COUPLE and the YOUNG
SOLDIER - all stare stiffly straight ahead averting their
eyes from Truman

No one is more uncomfortable than the BUS DRIVER Beads of
perspiration on his head he fumbles for the gear shift
apparently unsure how to operate it The gears grind

The OTHER PASSENGERS try not to notice The CHILD tugging
her MOTHERs sleeve points to Truman Her mother makes her
face the front of the bus Finally the SUPERVISOR enters the
bus

SUPERVISOR
Everybody off Weve got a problem

The relieved passengers hurriedly exit until Truman is the
only one remaining on the bus The Bus Driver looks almost
sorry for Truman who sits resolutely in his seat - the hint

of a tear of frustration in his eyes

BUS DRIVER
(softly)
Im sorry son

XT STREET - TRUMANS BICYCLE DAY

ira

As TRUMAN rides home on his bicycle he stares wildly about
him —- the rearview mirror on his bicycle is suddenly cause for
concern so are the trees and streetlamps lining the roadway

EXT TRUMANS BACKYARD DAY

TRUMAN staring at the highway from the bottom of the garden
doesnt bother to look up as MERYL still wearing her nurses
uniform approaches

TRUMAN
(referring to a distant car on
the expressway)
See that car way down there I bet its
a Suburu station wagon

Meryl looks idly over the fence at the approaching car
Finally a Suburu station wagon motors by Meryl is
unimpressed Truman turns his back on the highway to
continue his game

TRUMAN

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
I predict the next four cars will bea
white Honda Civic a blue and white Dodge
Dart with the front hubcap missing a
Volkswagen Beetle with a dented fender
and a motorcycle

Meryl doesnt wish to participate in the game and makes for
the house Truman holds her arm forcing her to watch He
turns to check his prediction A convoy of cars approaches

TRUMAN
Theres the Hondathe Dodgehere
comes that dented Beetle

Meryls attention wavers Truman tightens his grip

TRUMAN
Look

Following the VW is a school bus

MERYL
(mocking)
Wheres the motorcycle

Truman is momentarily disappointed

TRUMAN
Dont you want to know how I did that

A motorcycle putters by Meryl turns and walks back to the
house He hurries after her

MERYL
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque
Sunday I thought Id make my potato
salad Remind me--

TRUMAN
I wont be here Sunday

MERYL
—-we need more charcoal

TRUMAN
Are you listening to a word Im saying

MERYL
Youre upset because you want to go to

Truman is puzzled by her conciliatory tone

MERYL

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
Okay do it Get it out of your system
Save for a few months and go There
Happy now Im going to take a shower

She turns away

Lets go now

MERYL

Despite her protests Truman drags Meryl towards his car

TRUMAN
(as he shoves her into the car)
Im ready to go now Why wait

INT TRUMANS CAR DAY

TRUMAN holds MERYLs wrist to stop her exiting the car and
accelerates out of the driveway in reverse without looking -
almost running over PLUTO the dog and SPENCER with his
garbage can

Truman starts circling a gazebo at the center of a
roundabout faster and faster

TRUMAN
Where shall we go Where shall we go
Spontaneity is what its all about
Forget Fiji We cant very well drive to
Fiji can we What about Atlantic City

MERYL
(trying to mask her anxiety)
You hate gambling

TRUMAN
Thats right I do dont I

MERYL
So why do you want to go

TRUMAN
Because I never have Thats why you go
places isnt it

MERYL
Truman I think Im going to throw up

Truman roars off down the street

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
TRUMAN
Me too

Almost immediately Truman encounters a traffic snarl

TRUMAN
(a manic edge to his voice)
So much traffic this time of day
Does that strike you as peculiar

Without warning Truman suddenly dives down a sidestreet But
his move is anticipated At the end of the street a pack of
cars suddenly appears Other vehicles fill the gap behind

TRUMAN
(to Meryl marveling)
Blocked at every turn Beautifully
synchronized dont you agree

MERYL
(incredulous)
You blaming me for the traffic

TRUMAN
Should I

Truman reverses suddenly and makes a U-turn

TRUMAN
Youre right We could be stuck here
for hours Could be like this all
the way to Atlantic City Lets go
back Im sorry I dont know what
got into me

Truman starts heading back the way they came the roadway now
relatively free of traffic

MERYL
Would you please slow down Truman

Truman floors the car The car flies past their house

MERYL
Truman that was our house

TRUMAN
Ive changed my mind again Whats New

MERYL

(pleading)
Let me out Truman Youre not right in
the head You want to destroy yourself
you do it on your own

TRUMAN
(eerily calm)
I think Id like a little company

As he speeds erratically Truman glances at the streets on
either side of the main road where he discovers a distinct
lack of moving traffic

TRUMAN
(to the anxious Meryl at his side)
Look Meryl No cars I dont run into
traffic The traffic follows me around

(excited by his discovery)
Were in a moving pack dont you see

INTEXT TRUMANS CAR - BRIDGE DAY

But TRUMANs clear path is short-lived He is forced to slow
once again behind a line of other cars at a bridge

TRUMAN
(to Meryl)
Its hard to go places isnt it

MERYL
(looking up ahead at an
overturned car)
Theres been an accident Truman

TRUMAN
Uhuh Theres no accident Its just
more stalling

Truman floors the car again and swerves into the oncoming
lane He roars along the bridge on the wrong side of the
road Near the end of the bridge a distraught MOTORIST
dashes into the middle of the road waving his arms Truman
slams on the brakes

MOTORIST
(pointing to a small BOY lying
very still on the ground
beside a wrecked car)
--is there a doctor a nurse

MERYL
Truman its a child Ive got to help -

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
TRUMAN
(hardly glancing to the boy)
Hell be fine

Truman roars on almost bowling over the concerned motorist

MERYL
Truman I took the hypocrite oath

TRUMAN
I bet you did

Truman roars past a sign that reads YOU ARE NOW LEAVING
SEAHAVEN - Are you sure thats a good idea

Back at the accident scene the little boy apparently
uninjured sits up

INTEXT CAR DAY

They roar pass an illuminated sign - FOREST FIRE WARNING -
Extreme Danger

MERYL
Truman what about that sign

TRUMAN
Im sure theyre just exaggerating

Suddenly a 20-foot high wall of flame shoots across the
roadway in front of them - as if someone flicked on a gas
switch

MERYL
What about that - do you believe that

TRUMAN experiences his first moment of doubt He looks to
the terrified MERYL then closes his eyes tightly and
accelerates through the fire wall He is startled to find
that they have emerged on the other side singed but
unscathed

However the open road in front of them now disturbs Truman
for a different reason - its sheer lack of anything unusual
Signs along the road advertise motels and give directions to
other destinations - I-6211 - 2 miles Notel Motel - Pool
Color Tv

Meryl also now appears to be resigned to the journey

MERYL
So what do we do for money when we get to
New Orleans

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
TRUMAN
(not so confident now)
Ive got my Seahaven Bankcard

MERYL
So we just eat into our savings is that
the idea Id better call your mother

when we get there Shell be worried
sick - I dont know how shes going to
take this

Truman appears very unsure of himself

EXT ROADWAY DAY

However there is still a barrier between TRUMAN and Bourbon
Street The highway leading to a cloverleaf freeway
junction in the distance is completely blocked off by
Seahaven police cars No way past Nuclear silos in the
distance spew out an ominous puff of smoke A sign reads
SEAHAVEN ISLAND NUCLEAR POWER STATION - Clean Safe
Economical —- More Power To You

Truman is forced to slow at the police barricade

TRUMAN
Now what

OFFICER
(grim-faced indicating
the nearby power plant)
Leak at the plant They had to shut
her down

TRUMAN
Is there any way around

OFFICER
The whole areas being evacuated

TRUMAN
Well thank you for your help

OFFICER
Youre welcome Truman

Trumans eyes widen at the mention of his name from an
apparent stranger As the officer turns Truman bolts from
the car leaving MERYL in the passenger seat

MERYL
Truman Come back

Truman flees into the forest

INT A LIVING ROOM SOMEWHERE DAY

The TWO OLD LADIES we have observed before are almost overcome
with tension One lady reaches out for her companions hand

EXT FOREST NEAR SEAHAVEN NUCLEAR POWER PLANT DAY

TRUMAN bursts past the alien-looking HAZARDOUS WATER WORKERS
in their protective suits carrying detection instruments
The workers give chase in their cumbersome suits trying to
cut off his path

Nearing the edge of the forest Truman hears the sound of
hammers and saws But before he has time to see the source
of the sound he is tackled to the ground

As SEAHAVEN POLICE OFFICERS drag him away one of the WASTE
WORKERS walks the remaining few yards pushing aside a wall
of tropical foliage We now see what Truman was prevented
from seeing

A Polynesian island is under construction by dozens of
RIGGERS PAINTERS and SET DECORATORS Large cranes are
lifting palm trees into place a fake volcano is being tested
in the distance and rehearsals for a firewalking ceremony are
underway complete with hot coals DRUMMERS and FIREWALKERS in
native dress

The wings and fuselage of an airliner are being constructed

on a hydraulic gimbal Leading into one side of the airliner
is a covered walkway emblazoned with a sign Seahaven
Island - Departures Emerging from the opposite side of the

airliner is an old-fashioned airline stairway with the sign
Welcome to Fiji

At the foot of the steps TWO WOMEN in Fijian dress are being
shown the correct way to present a floral lei

TRUMAN

(ignoring her medical advice)
Why do you want to have a child with me

Meryl picks up a package and holds it to camera

MERYL

TRUMAN

Truman looks into her eyes and with surprising swiftness
grabs her wrist and disarms her

TRUMAN
No youre scaring me Meryl

Truman grabs Meryl and turns the Chefs Mate on her He
stares wildly about him

TRUMAN
Stop this now Ill do it I swear

MERYL

Upon hearing her remark Trumans eyes widen Sensing that
she too is addressing a third person he jerks her head
around to read her face

TRUMAN
(wild-eyed)
Who were you talking to

MERYL
(incredulous)
Youre the one talking to the walls

TRUMAN
No You said Do something Who were
you talking to Tell me

MERYL
Truman stop it

Suddenly the front door chimes

TRUMAN
Right on time Cops must be telephatic

Truman grabs his peeler and marches Meryl down the hallway to
the front door The doorbell chimes a second and third time
more insistently

MARLON (0OC)

Truman Its me Marlon I need to talk

to you
Truman flinches He was so convinced it would be the police
He takes a step back against the hallway wall Before he can

decide what to do MARLON has opened the unlocked front door
to be confronted with the sight of Truman holding the peeler
to Meryls throat

Marlon locks eyes with Truman Sizing up the situation he

slowly but decisively removes the peeler from Trumans hand
Meryl wrenches herself free from Trumans now limp grasp and
collapses into Marlons arm sobbing

MERYL
(distraught)
How can anyone expect me to carry on
under these conditions This
isunprofessional

EXT UNFINISHED BRIDGE NIGHT

MARLON and TRUMAN both nursing bottles of beer sit on the
end of the unfinished bridge

TRUMAN
I dont know what to think Marlon
Maybe Im going out of my mind but I
get the feeling that the world revolves
around me somehow

MARLON
Its a lot of world for one man You sure
thats not wishful thinking you wishing
youd made something more of yourself
Christ Truman who hasnt sat on the John
and had an imaginary interview on
Seahaven Tonight Who hasnt wanted to
be somebody

TRUMAN
This is different Everybody seems to be
in on it

Marlon looks around as if drawing inspiration from somewhere
in the night

MARLON

we were in long pants The only way we

ever made it through high school was
cheating off each others test papers

Jesus they were identical I always
liked that because whatever the answer
was-—

Truman chimes in nodding fondly at the memory

TRUMAN and MARLON
—-we were right together and we were
wrong together

MARLON
The only night either of us ever spent
in jail we spent together and I wet
myself but you never told anyone I was
best man at your wedding and my brother
was best man at my wedding and you didnt
talk to me for a month over that and I
didnt blame you because youve been more
of a brother to me than hes ever been

Truman is slowly coming around - Marlons speech from the
heart soothing away his pain

MARLON
I know things havent worked out for
either of us like we used to sit up on
Monroe Avenue all night and dream they
would We all let opportunities pass us
by None of us asks for the dance as
often as we should I know that feeling
when its like everythings slipping away
and you dont want to believe it so you
look for answers someplace else But
well the point is I would gladly step
in front of traffic for you

we see a flash of guilt flicker across MARLONs face

INT CONTROL ROOM NIGHT

CHRISTOF emotionally drained by the events slumps in his

chair CHOLE rests a supportive hand on his shoulder The head

INT A BEDROOM SOMEWHERE NIGHT

A YOUNG WOMAN reclines on a bed her back against the wall
Propped up on her knees is a book However shes not
reading but staring straight into camera - a look of profound
sadness on her face It is SYLVIA

From her point-of-view we see a portable television set ona
table at the foot of the bed

On the television is a live picture of TRUMAN - the first
time we have seen him on a television screen He is sitting
at his kitchen table unaware of the cameras recording him

The shot is static He just sits there in silence a
steaming cup of cocoa in front of him and a plate of
untouched cookies

At one point a sponsors border appears on the screen
tastefully framing the action with the message MOCOCOA -
Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua After
several seconds the border disappears

Suddenly the live picture of Truman shrinks into a window on
the screen to accommodate a title sequence that begins to
play around the edge of the image The Truman Show theme
music begins

The camera cranes up and over the Hollywood sign the
flatlands of Burbank stretching into the distance

ANNOUNCER (VO)
From the network that never sleeps -
broadcasting live and unedited 24 hours a
day 7 days a week around the globe

During this continuous aerial shot overlapping scenes from

adolescence and finally adulthood Photographs of leading
CAST MEMBERS also appear in individual frames

ANNOUNCER (VO)

with Hannah Gill as Meryl Burbank
Louis Coltrane as Marlon Alanis Montclair
as Mother re-introducing Walter Moore as
her husband Kirk

The music swells as the camera approaches a mammoth structure at
the base of the mountains - a dome so vast it dwarfs everything
around it At the top of the dome is a huge painting of Trumans
face encircled by satellite dishes - inside each dish is a single
letter spelling out T-H-E T-R-U-M-A-N S-H-O-W - a banner
proclaims 30th Great Year

ANNOUNCER (VO)
and Truman Burbank as Himself taped
in the worlds largest studio one of
only two man-made structures visible from
space comes the longest running
documentary soap opera in history now in
its 30th great year - The Truman Show

The camera rushes towards the outside wall of the gigantic dome
bathed in sunlight When we emerge on the other side it is
night The camera cranes up from a calm moonlit ocean to the
nightsky above As we near the crescent-shaped moon we
discover that it is actually a window overlooking Seahaven
Standing in the crater window is the suited CHRISTOF

INT LUNAR STUDIO NIGHT

Pulling back from the window we reveal an INTERVIEWER mid-
forties conservative suit and hair A large television
shows a live picture of Truman Immersed in his book

INTERVIEWER

Im your host Mike Michaelson coming to
you live from the Lunar Room on the 121st
story of the OmniCam Ecosphere 2800 feet
above Seahaven Island Tonight a
special edition of Tru Talk the forum
where we discuss and analyze recent
events on the show We are honored to
bring you a rare and exclusive interview
with the shows conceiver creator tele-
visionary the Man-In-The-Moon himself--
Christof

(referring to the image of

Truman between them)
I remind viewers that as The Truman Show is

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
a living history it is our practice to keep
the image of Truman on screen at all times

A TITLE APPEARS Due to the Live and Unedited nature of the
program viewer discretion is advised

The Interviewer turns to Christof

INTERVIEWER
Welcome

CHRISTOF
Thank you

INTERVIEWER

The catalyst for the recent dramatic
events was of course Trumans father
Kirk and his infiltration onto the show
Before we discuss that its worth
reminding viewers that this isnt the
first time someone from the outside world
has tried to reach Truman

CHRISTOF
We have had our close calls in the past

Behind the two men the constantly playing image of Truman
engrossed in his book is relegated to a window of the screen

PLAYBACK - INT TRUMANS HOME CHRISTMAS MORNING

TRUMAN 7 is opening presents under the tree - KIRK and
MOTHER proudly looking on

INTERVIEWER
Who can forget the infamous Christmas
Present incident in the seventh season

Suddenly a small MAN bursts from a large Christmas parcel
Kirk and the man grapple on the floor in front of the stunned
seven-year-old Kirk drags him away

PLAYBACK -—- EXT CITY STREET DAY

As the adult TRUMAN makes his way to work a PARACHUTIST drops
from the sky into the main street only yards behind him

INTERVIEWER
And only last summer Billie Blackbird
made his third attempt leaping froma
lighting gantry

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
The parachutist is dressed entirely in black with a message
emblazoned on his chest TRUMAN YOURE ON TV COMMUTERS
grab the man and drag him away - Truman blissfully unaware of
the incident

CHRISTOF
(dismissive)
These people have their own agendas
Many just want to be on television
themselves

PLAYBACK -—- EXT CITY STREET DAY

The encounter between TRUMAN and the homeless KIRK is
replayed up to the point where Kirk is bundled onto the bus

INTERVIEWER
Of course there hasnt been anything
to compare with this - the first time an
intruder has been a former cast member--

al

CHRISTO
--a dead one at that

INTERVIEWER
--and certainly the first time that an
intruder has been rewarded with a
starring role
(gushing)
I really must congratulate you on writing
Kirk back in A master stroke

CHRISTOF
(feigning modesty)
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in
Trumans life I came to the conclusion
that he was the only one who could end it

INTERVIEWER
I understand hes hardly had a life of
his own since he left the show How did
you convince him--was it the opportunity
to be close to Truman again

CHRISTOF
That and a fat new contract

INTERVIEWER
How do you intend to explain his twenty-
two year absence

CHRISTOF
Amnesia

INTERVIEWER
(impressed nodding in
agreement)

Of course

The Interviewer consults his note

INTERVIEWER
Lets talk ratings Truman has always
enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge
over the last few days--how do you hope
to sustain that audience now that Truman
appears to have reconciled himself

CHRISTOF
As you know ratings have never been our
primary goal I imagine well lose those
voyeurs only interested in witnessing
Trumans latest torment However Im
certain that our core audience will
remain loyal

INTERVIEWER
But recent events have been so dramatic
it does raise the perennial question
What keeps us watching this one man

twenty-four hours a day - eating
sleeping working sitting for hours in
contemplation

CHRISTOF

It has to be the reality

During this segment we cut to a cross-section of VIEWERS -
the WAITRESS and BARMAN in the bar the TWO OLD WOMEN on
their sofa the TWO SECURITY GUARDS and the MAN in the bath
listening to Christofs theories on their viewing habits

CHRISTOF
Weve become tired of watching actors give
us phony emotions bored with pyrotechnics
and special effects While the world he
inhabits is counterfeit theres nothing

fake about Truman himself No scripts no
cue cards Its not always Shakespeare
but its genuine Thats how he can

support an entire channel

INTERVIEWER
A window onto the human condition

CHRISTOF
I prefer to think of it as a mirror

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
At that moment Truman - still live on the screen -
unwittingly punctuates the pretentious remark with a belch
Christof and the Interviewer try not to notice

CHRISTOF
Not only does he give us a glimpse of the
truth he gives us a glimpse of ourselves

INTERVIEWER
But how do you account for the popularity of
those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps

CHRISTOF
We find many viewers leave him on all
night for comfort Havent you ever

watched your child or your lover sleep

INTERVIEWER
Lets go to some of those viewers calls

The Interviewer presses a blinking illuminated button on his
desks high-tech phone terminal During this segment

CHRISTO
Thank you

MALE CALLER 1
How much of a strain has the last few
days placed on the actors

CHRISTOF
Working on Truman has always been a
huge commitment for an actor not just in
terms of separation from friends and
family but since Truman essentially
drives the plot it is a never-ending
improvisation - witness Marlons
extraordinary performance in the recent

INTERVIEWER
(cutting off the call)
Are we talking Emmies

CHRISTOF
Certainly a nomination

INTERVIEWER
Of course Truman has always been very
much in on casting

CHRISTOF
As with our own lives the only people he
cant cast are his family Otherwise he
has final approval able to elevate an
extra into a lead role as was the case
with his only real friend Marlon or
alternatively relegate a star to a bit
player

videographer Christof

FEMALE CALLER 1 (0S)
Christof Ive admired your work my whole
life although I cant say Ive seen it all

CHRISTOF
Who can

FEMALE CALLER 1
Can you settle an argument for me
Whats the longest time Truman has been
off-camera

CHRISTOF

(trace of pride)
In his entire life forty-two minutes A
technical fault in the twelfth season
accounts for most of that time The
remainder generally results from
blindspots in the early days when
Truman would stray out of range of our
cameras

INTERVIEWER
We should remind viewers that Truman
especially as a child presented a
challenge for the production

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
CHRISTOF
(turning to the screen)
Let me demonstrate some examples

Footage of TRUMAN as a baby appears on the screen - as a
newborn INFANT held in a pair of anonymous latex-gloved
hands and as a TODDLER dressed in various baby outfits -
on one occasion looking through the bars of his crib

CHRISTOF
He was curious from birth - premature by
two weeks as if he couldnt wait to get
started

INTERVIEWER
Of course his eagerness to leave his
mothers womb also meant he was the one
selected

CHRISTOF
(enthusing)
In competition with five other unwanted
pregnancies - the casting of a show
determined by an air date - he was the
one who arrived on cue

INTERVIEWER
Who knew that a show originally meant to
last one year - Bringing Up Baby
would turn into a cradle to grave
concept He is in fact the first child
in the world to be legally adopted by a
corporation

CHRISTOF
Thats correct

INTERVIEWER
And the show now generates a yearly
income equivalent to the gross national
product of a small country

CHRISTOF
People forget it takes the population of
an entire country to keep the show running

INTERVIEWER
No of course not
(quickly changing the subject)
And since the show runs 24 hours a day
with no commercial breaks the staggering
profits are all generated from product
placement

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
CHRISTOF
Yes everything you see on the show is

for sale - from the actors wardrobe
food products to the very homes they
live in--

INTERVIEWER

All products carefully chosen and
tested by you for quality and
aesthetic value

CHRISTOF
Theres nothing on the show I dont
use myself

INTERVIEWER
And its all available in the Truman
Show catalogue Operators are

standing by
Christof nods

INTERVIEWER
Why do you feel that Trumans never
come close to discovering the true
nature of his world

CHRISTOF
We accept the reality of the world with
which were presented As the show
expanded naturally we were forced to
manufacture ways to keep Truman in
Seahaven - demonstrating that every
venture is accompanied by a risk

The SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN we have seen in other flashbacks
appears on the screen Wearing a cowboy outfit he goes to
cross the walkway of a bridge when he is suddenly confronted
by a savage DOG wearing a spiked collar

CHRISTOF
Later Kirks drowning made much of
this kind of intervention unnecessary

We freeze on seven-year-old Trumans terrified face

INTERVIEWER
Youve never actually met Truman
yourself Never thought about doing a
cameo--playing a veterinarian ora
priest something like that

CHRISTOF
Ive been tempted But I think its

wouldnt want to get emotionally
caught up

How can you say he lives a life like
any other

CHRISTOF

(sensing the thinly

disguised resentment in the

Callers voice)
As the Bard says All the worlds a
stage and all the men and women merely
players The only difference between
Truman and ourselves is that his life is
more thoroughly documented He is
confronted with the same obstacles and
influences that confront us all He
plays his allotted roles as we all do--

FEMALE CALLER 2
--Hes not a performer Hes a prisoner

The Interviewer goes to cut off the call but Christof stops him

CHRISTOF

(rising to the challenge)
And can you tell me caller that youre
not a player on the stage of life -
playing out your allotted role He can
leave at any time If his was more than
just a vague ambition if he were
absolutely determined to discover the
truth theres no way we could prevent
him I think what really distresses you
Caller is that ultimately Truman prefers
the comfort of his cell as you call it

FEMALE CALLER 2

herself giving herself away)

positive experience for Truman and for
the viewing public

MALE CALLER 2 (0S)
Christof Congratulations on the way youve
always handled Trumans sex life - the
classical music soft lighting and so on
But has the recent violence caused a problem
for the shows sponsors

CHRISTOF
The sponsors know the risks going in
although we do try to maintain standards
—- a level of decorum For instance Ive
never put a camera in the toilet

Still in silhouette SYLVIA turns down the volume on the
television Focusing on the window on the screen that
displays TRUMAN she comes close to the screen catching his
melancholy saddened by his regression

INT TRUMANS BASEMENT MORNING

TRUMAN breathes in the scent of Sylvias sweater one last
time before reluctantly replacing it in the trunk together
with his book To The Ends Of The Earth - The Age Of
Exploration For a final time he regards his unfinished
picture of SYLVIA inside - two holes where the eyes should
be As he does so he finds two lost paper cuttings - a pair
of eyes on the basement floor He tries them Ironically
they fit - the picture completed He closes the trunk
anyway With a sense of finality he fastens the lock

INT CONTROL ROOM NIGHT

The giant ON-AIR monitor in the control room plays a close-up
shot of Truman sleeping

CHRISTOF comes close to the monitor and almost touches the
screen As he does so Truman twitches in his sleep

INT BATHROOM MORNING

TRUMAN wipes the mist from the mirror of the bathroom cabinet
and stares into it in a way he has never done before

INT CONTROL ROOM MORNING

Close up on the giant ON-AIR monitor in the control room
It displays a wide shot of Truman staring into the bathroom
mirror

We slowly pull back to reveal SIMEON and the other VIDEO
OPERATORS sitting at the mixing desks arranged in tiers
reminiscent of an auditorium or NASAs Mission Control
Each mixing desk contains a dozen-or-so built-in monitors
and is designed with a location such as Trumans House

— Interior Trumans Office - Cubicle Tyrones Deli
The operator at each desk sitting in a swivel chair and
wearing the slimmest of headsets is responsible for
monitoring a particular location

The monitors cover virtually every facet of Trumans life
Camera angles from the interior of Trumans house his
backyard car office the deli he frequents the seashore
to which he is drawn the unfinished bridge where he golfs
with Marlon - many of the locations strangely devoid of
people

Simeon seated in the front row of mixing desks stares back
at Trumans image on the monitor slightly unnerved

SIMEON
(to a nearby COLLEAGUE)
Is he looking at us

As if to reassure the technician Truman begins one of his
familiar monologues He talks to the mirror as if being
interviewed

TRUMA
--What are my plans now Well next Im
thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an
authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe
--Im talking about the north fork a
class five rapid - only Im not going
down the Yuba Im going up Do you

to some dreary office to rubber stamp
meaningless documentsdo you

Back at work at the insurance company TRUMAN sits in his
cubicle making another of his cold calls

TRUMAN

the second row at an amateur production
of Hamlet Hamlets dagger slips from his
hand and flies into the audience

A YOUNG WOMAN carrying a stack of files catches Trumans eye

as she passes VIVIAN She is faintly reminiscent of Sylvia
at the same age - even wearing a similar sweater
TRUMAN

--what Im saying is life is a fragile
thinghullo

EXT TRUMANS BACKYARD DUSK

TRUMAN wheels his lawnmower deliberately averting his eyes
from the back of the house Staring out of the kitchen
window a tall glass of iced tea in her hand MERYL has been
anticipating her husbands appearance She wears a
neckbrace we sense more as a reminder to Truman than for any
medical benefit she might derive

Feeling Meryls eyes burning into his back Truman fires up
the mower and heads directly towards the symbolically uncut

section of grass We focus on the errant blades of grass as
they are severed by the mower - a new Elk Rotary The lawn
is now uniformly trimmed - Trumans final act of defiance
laid to rest

INT STUDIO -—- CONFERENCE ROOM NIGHT

CHRISTOF stands at a large specially screened window
silhouetted against the twinkling stars and full moon of a
hyper-real nightsky

Members of the cast enter the room —- principal characters in
Trumans life - MERYL MARLON MOTHER KIRK TYRONE LAWRENCE
and the new actress VIVIAN They take their places around a
long oval table for a story conference - Vivian sitting
slightly apart from the rest of the cast

We glimpse over Christofs shoulder at what he sees - the
town of Seahaven far below bathed in moonlight He comes
out of his reverie and joins his cast sitting at the head of
the table In front of him a TV tablet plays silently -
showing Truman drinking a glass of milk in his kitchen

CHRISTO
(to the assembled cast)
First of all Id like to welcome Walter
back onto the show

You may have done us more of a favor than
you ever imagined
(turning to Meryl using her
real name)
Regrettably I also have to inform you
that Hannah has chosen not to renew her
contract

All eyes turn to Meryl She looks at the floor

CHRISTOF
Im sure we can all respect her reasons

Meryl receives a sympathetic squeeze of the hand from her co-
star Marlon now out of wardrobe wearing an Armani suit

CHRISTOF

As you all know we have already begun to
orchestrate her break-up from Truman

(more up-beat)

pleased to announce that televisions

place You witnessed the initial contact

The rest of the cast nod politely in Claudias direction
CHLOE passes out a bound document to each cast member

CHRISTOF
(referring to the documents)
This is a copy of Claudias back story
Her characters name is Vivien

The cast idly flips through the documents prominently
stamped on the cover NOT TO BE TAKEN ON SET

CHRISTOF

We intend to entice Truman into the affair
as soon as possible Claudia will make a
pass at the insurance seminar Trumans
attending Details are in your schedules

(pause for effect)
I dont have to tell you how critical the
next few weeks will be This takes us
into the next generation When Trumans
child is born the network will be
switching to a two-channel format to
chronicle both lives

CLAUDIA
What happens when Truman and the baby are
both on camera together

CHRISTOF
This will simply be duplicate coverage

CLAUDIA

INT TRUMANS BASEMENT NIGHT

TRUMAN sleeps on a cot bed in his basement - more cluttered
than usual A virtual bombsite - dozens of cardboard boxes
stacked everywhere Although he is covered in bedding his
sock-clad feet stick out of the bed covers The outline of
his body is still clearly visible He snores quietly

INT VARIOUS VIEWER LOCATIONS NIGHT

The TWO OLD LADIES have nodded off on their sofa in front of
the television their breathing and occasional snores echo
those of Truman

In the BAR the WAITRESS - normally an avid viewer - only idly
glances to the screen as she passes with a tray of drinks

The MAN in the bath resignedly lets the water out of the tub
and goes to get out

The MOTHER only occasionally glances to the screen as she
feeds her BABY Her DAUGHTER has her eyes closed bopping to
her Walkman

SIMEON sits at his control desk directing the night-shift
He pays scant attention to the big screen giving his
instructions in a lethargic metronomic manner

SIMEON
Ready two Go to two

An OPERATOR eating a slice of pizza presses one of the
illuminated buttons on the panel and the camera angle changes
to a close shot of Trumans covered head The camera stays on
the blanketed head for a long moment

SIMEON
And back to the medium

Another button is pressed and the angle changed A trace of
frustration is evident in the control room Recording a
sleeping subject is unrewarding enough without also having to
contend with Trumans recently acquired camera-shyness

opens and CHRISTOF enters dressed in a smoking jacket Simeon and

the Operators subtly straighten in their chairs Christof pretends

not to notice He is staring intently at the ON-AIR monitor
CHRISTOF

Christof watches Truman a trace of concern in his eyes
CHLOE enters

CHRISTOF
(referring to the debris in
Trumans basement)
What happened down there

SIMEON
He was tidying up his garbage
(sensing Christofs concern)
I was going to call you But half-way
through he gave up and fell asleep

Apparently satisfied Christof turns to an Operator

CHRISTOF

tomorrows insurance convention

Reading off the notes in Chloes folder the Operator punches up

a batch of camera angles on smaller preview monitors They show
a generic-looking hotel devoid of actors A banner in reception
reads Welcome Seahaven Life and Accident

The Operator looks to Christof for approval and realizes his
producers attention has wandered Christof has wandered
down to the front of the room to stand beside the giant ON-
AIR monitor still displaying the sleeping figure of Truman

CHRISTOF
Give me a shot from Trumans ring

SIMEON
He gave it back to his father

Christof nods

CHRISTOF
(a trace of concern)
Why is he so still

Christof picks up a spare headset from the panel and puts it
to his ear

CHRISTOF
Isolate the audio

An Operator pushes up an audio fader on the panel Christof
and his colleagues listen to Trumans steady breathing in
their headphones

SIMEON
(shrugs)
Hes still breathing

Simeon and the Operators nod reassured that nothing is
amiss Christof is not so easily convinced

CHRISTOF
Give me a preview An ECU on his torso

A camera hidden in the rooms lamp zooms in to Trumans prone
outline While the breathing remains steady the body does
not rise and fall Christof still listening to his
headphones detects a faint scratching sound followed by a
strange thud

CHRISTOF

to Chloe)

INT CONTROL ROOM NIGHT

CHRISTOF and SIMEON concentrate on another separate monitor
playing in fast-rewind time code in the bottom right-hand
corner It is a recording of the nights transmission
Simeon pauses on the last on-camera appearance by Truman

They watch Truman on-screen switch off the basement light
and climb into the cot bed fully clothed immediately pulling
the covers over his head As the light is switched off the

scrolling forward in fast-forward mode Christof suddenly
points to screen

On the blown-up screen between a cardboard box and a chair
leg it is barely possible to make out Trumans hand as he

INT CONTROL ROOM NIGHT

Reminiscent of a military headquarters in wartime the
control room is a scene of barely controlled panic SECURITY
GUARDS come and go phones ring lights flash every
available VIDEO MIXER is working The monitors - the eyes
of the searchers - are systematically scrutinized for any
sign of Truman CHRISTOF orchestrates operations from his
position at the center of the control panel

SIMEON
(nervous)
Weve declared a curfew Everyone else
is at first positions

CHRISTOF
All prop cars accounted for

SIMEON
He has to be on foot He has the
worlds most recognizable face He

cant disappear

EXT SEAHAVEN — MAIN STREET NIGHT

We pan down one empty street after another The town center is
totally eerily deserted Suddenly a line of PEOPLE comes
around the corner fanned out cross the street - a man-hunt

PEOPLE of every description shoulder to shoulder marching
down the otherwise empty streets the way a search is
conducted at a crime scene The lines include PRINCIPALS and
EXTRAS lined arm and arm wardrobed for their usual roles as

EXECUTIVES and SECRETARIES STORE CLERKS TELEPHONISTS
MAINTENANCE and CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WAITERS and WAITRESSES
COOKS SHOPPERS HEALTH WORKERS SECURITY GUARDS POSTAL
WORKERS POLICE OFFICERS FIRE FIGHTERS and HOMELESS PEOPLE

We occasionally glimpse Trumans friends and colleagues
amongst the searchers —- MARLON LAWRENCE MOTHER and KIRK
VIVIEN and TYRONE Even the WASHINGTONs and SPENCER and
PLUTO have joined the search - a snarling Pluto straining at
the leash has now assumed the role of tracker dog - Trumans
pajamas waved in front of his nose (clearly miscast as the
friendly neighborhood pooch)

Searchlights from Seahavens many towers sweep the town
Once the light falls on a blackened face cowering in the
bushes beside a picket fence - the fence now faintly
reminiscent of prison bars Even the beam of the full moon
appears to be sweeping the town like a searchlight

EXT BRIDGE NIGHT

Barriers have been erected at the bridge leading out of
Seahaven guarded by several Seahaven police cars

An extra dressed as a DERELICT wheels his shopping cart
toward the bridge

The derelict takes a look along the walkway alongside the
bridge as if participating in the search He finds a POLICE
OFFICER standing on the walkway

POLICE OFFICER
Any sign of him

DERELICT
(gravelly voice)
Not yet

POLICE OFFICER
Take it easy

INT CONTROL ROOM NIGHT

A VIDEO OPERATOR in the sixth row watches the scene on one of
his monitors - the derelict standing with his back to camera
Just as the derelict turns toward camera the Operator turns
away to take a sip of coffee He misses what we see on his
monitor - the derelicts blackened face belongs to TRUMAN

at Marlons mercy

Without a word Marlon walks past Truman and rejoins the search

Truman glances back to Marlons retreating figure but Marlon
never looks back

EXT DOCKSIDE DAY

TRUMAN reaches the edge of the dock He looks out over the
bay There riding at anchor some two hundred yards out is
a sail boat - the same boat that circled Kirk and Trumans
sail boat many years earlier

We see a close-up of Trumans terrified eyes in his blackened
face staring down at the lapping water He steels himself
shuts out the doubts and dives into the water

INT CONTROL ROOM NIGHT

SIMEON

SIMEON
(confused)
Why would we--

CHRISTOF
Sweep the harbor

His COLLEAGUES begin to flick through dozens of waterborne
hidden camera shots - in moored craft lighthouses and buoys
- trying to locate Truman

Suddenly on one of the monitors there appears a single sail
etched against the horizon

INT OLD WOMENS APARTMENT NIGHT

The TWO OLD WOMEN doze against each other on the sofa in
front of the TV

The classical music on the television is abruptly replaced by
the sound of the wind and the sea One Old Lady blinks her
eyes open her breath taken away by the sight of Truman at
the wheel of the sail boat She rouses her companion

INT CONTROL ROOM NIGHT
CHRISTOF
(staring intently at the
ON-AIR monitor)

SIMEON scans a computer shot list He types in a code
A camera from the mast of Trumans sail boat activates Truman
unaware of the camera is concentrating on his sailing

By now the ocean spray has washed most of the dirt from

TRUMANs face - only a residue remains The rags he wears
are soaked

As he steers he occasionally refers to a HOW TO SAIL book
from his coat pocket

EXT HARBOR DAY

The sea choppier now rising and falling steeply beneath his
boat TRUMAN nears a large buoy bobbing clumsily in the
strong swell An official-looking sign on the buoy reads -
DANGEROUS WATERS DO NOT ENTER We see an extreme close
up of the nautical signpost where a disguised miniature
camera tracks Trumans progress

Christof nods to controls on the mixing desk marked WIND

EXT HARBOR DAY

Storm clouds roll towards TRUMANs boat at an alarming speed
He looks back towards the Seahaven skyline rapidly receding
behind him Doubts invade Trumans head but he shuts them
out and steers into the teeth of the storm - a look of
resolve in his eyes we have never witnessed before

INT CONTROL ROOM NIGHT

MOSES and ROMAN pace at the back of the control room
CHRISTOF is focused on his monitor Like Truman he steels
himself for a fight

RAIN towards their maximum settings

CHRISTOF
Kill the lights

EXT HARBOR DAY

Darkness suddenly descends High winds and horizontal
driving rain buffet the boat TRUMAN fights the tiller
Hurricane force winds shake the mast and keel ripping the
sails to shreds

Suddenly the mast of Trumans boat is struck by a bolt of
lightning - snapping the rigging and knocking Truman
overboard Flailing in the tempest Truman manages to grab
hold of a trailing rope from the mast and hand-over-hand
drags himself back on board Truman takes the rope and
lashes himself to the wheel

Monstrous waves continually submerge the boat With what
little is left of his rigging Truman continues to head into
the gale

TRUMAN
(shouting above the storm
screaming up to the sky)
Come on is that the best you can do
Youre gonna have to kill me

INT CONTROL ROOM NIGHT

In contrast to his panic-stricken COLLEAGUES CHRISTOF gives
an outward appearance of calm Only we witness the minute
bead of sweat appearing at his temple that betrays him

SIMEON
(shocked at the sight of Truman
binding himself to the boat)
Is he out of his mind

his display of courage)

All eyes turn in Christofs direction None of the Operators

Christof reaches to the panel and does it himself turning
the WAVE controls to their maximum settings

EXT OCEAN DAY

A series of giant breakers march in formation across the sea
—- arising from an unseen source

EXT OCEAN DAY

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
The waves break across Trumans vessel TRUMAN appears to be
losing his fight against the storm each successive wave
taking its roll on his body sapping his strength his
bindings the only thing keeping him upright His head
slumps the tiller goes loose in his grasp rocking out of
control Trumans will is draining away

INT CONTROL ROOM NIGHT

The control room CREW watch the heroic image of Truman on the
ON-AIR monitor awestruck as if they too are now spectators
watching a movie

EXT OCEAN DAY

As he is about to be overcome by the next wave TRUMAN
clamps the wheel with his whole body and braces for one
last wave

But the wave does not come A strange phenomenon is
occurring in the ocean A distinct division has appeared in
the ocean swell Between the large rolling waves lies a
corridor of calmer water several hundred yards wide a
curious escape lane The wind and the rain are also
subsiding the darkness lifting A mist clings to the
surface of the water Truman steers his sail boat down the
eerie corridor

Several large dark shapes emerge on the horizon Land
Islands The shapes containing some enormous mechanism
including a huge wheel only half exposed above water level
appear to be the source of the peculiar wave formations

Truman continues to steer his wrecked sailboat towards the
infinitely receding horizon All is calm until we see the
bow of the boat suddenly strike a huge blue wall knocking
Truman off his feet Truman recovers and clambers across the
deck to the bow of the boat Looming above him out of the
sea is a cyclorama of colossal dimensions The sky he has
been sailing towards is nothing but a painted backdrop
Truman looks upward straining his eyes to see the top of the
sky but it curves away at a steep angle beyond his sight

Clinging to the boat with one hand he tentatively reaches
out towards the painted cyclorama He touches the sky

He looks about him and simply laughs

As the boat drifts alongside the seemingly never-ending curve
of the cyclorama TRUMANs attention is drawn to an outline
in the otherwise flawless backdrop He retrieves the
identikit picture of Sylvia from his coat pocket and clambers
to the prow of the boat

There camouflaged in the painted skyscape just above the
water line is a door Truman grabs hold of the recessed
doorhandle and halts the drifting boat He stands in front
of the door and closes his eyes in a silent prayer
