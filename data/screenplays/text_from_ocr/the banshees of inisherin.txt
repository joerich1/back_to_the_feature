(SULLIVAN) a good-looking man of 35 or so walks the
island’s winding stone-walled lanes past thatched cottages
the ancient graveyard castle ruins a little lake Past the
island’s small dock-side town and the boats tied up there
Past a startled cow that makes him smile

Finally he comes over the brow of a hill that looks down
upon

No-one there Musicalesoteric details hang the brightly
painted walls PADRAIC sees the half-smoked cigarette in the
ashtray the mug of tea beside it still warm sees something
far-off out the window He picks up COLM’s telescope from a
shelf looks out window

POV THROUGH TELESCOPE - Far off Colm walking away up the
hill already a half mile gone

PADRAIC (CONTD)
(quietly)
Where the Hell are you heading off to

EXT LANEWAYS - DAY 12

PADRAIC tries to catch up to the distant COLM along the
winding high-walled lanes but COLM is going at some pace

PADRAIC takes the next few corners as quickly as he can but
as he comes on a long straight stretch he realises COLM is
nowhere to be seen

PADRAIC
Is he scaling the walls or what is he
up to

PADRAIC climbs a wall and sees COLM scaling a wall into a
distant field in which there’s a bull

PADRAIC (CONTD)
He is scaling the walls Well feck ya
so Although be careful of that bull
Colm

COLM threatens the bull with a clenched fist and the bull
backs sheepishly away

PADRAIC (CONTD)
Oh okay

COLM scales another wall and on through the next field
PADRAIC (CONTD)

Where’s he going to There’s nowhere to go
to

EXT LANEWAY TO PUB - DAY 13

PADRAIC trudges back to the pub There’s a peel of laughter
inside PADRAIC looks in the window COLM is sitting at the
bar laughing with JONJO and GERRY MULLINS another older
regular

INT PUB - DAY 14

PADRAIC enters the pub and idles towards the jovial group
smiling As he gets there COLM loses his jocularity

PADRAIC

A tension COLM not even looking at him The others look at

came in and ordered his pint before

COLM

COLM takes his pint and leaves the pub sitting at the table
outside which we see through the small window GERRY and JONJO
a little perturbed by all this

GERRY
Are ye rowing

PADRAIC
I didn’t think we were rowing

GERRY
Well ye are rowing

JONJO
Well ye are rowing He’s sitting outside
on his own like a whadyacall

15 EXT PUB - DAY 15

COLM is sitting there smoking at the table overlooking the
island and the ocean as PADRAIC comes out

PADRAIC
Now I’m sitting here next to ya and if
youre going back inside I’m following
ya inside and if you’re going home I’m
following you there too no matter how
many walls you scale or bulls you
threaten

PADRAIC sits
PADRAIC (CONTD)
Now if I’ve done something to ya just
tell me what I’ve done to ya and if
I’ve said something to ya maybe I said
something when I was drunk and I’ve
forgotten it but I don’t think I said
something when I was drunk and I’ve
forgotten it but if I did then tell me
what it was and Ill say sorry for that
too Colm With all me heart I’1l say
sorry Just stop running away from me
like some fool of a moody schoolchild

COLM
But you didn’t say anything to me
And you didn’t do anything to me

PADRAIC
That’s what I was thinking like

COLM
I just don’t like you no more

PADRAIC is tremendously hurt by this but tries not to show
it as best he can

PADRAIC
You do like me
COLM

PADRAIC
(pause)

You liked me yesterday

COLM

PADRAIC

COLM gives him a look and returns to the pub and PADRAIC is
left there unbelievably sad He finishes his pint almost
choking on it looks back at the pub and the men inside then
walks off home

on the table beside him The walls are as equally brightly
painted as COLM’s though a different colour and far more
bare SIOBHAN enters with groceries surprised to see him

SIOBHAN

(pause)
Was the pub closed

PADRAIC
No It was open

Perturbed she sits in a chair across from him on the other
side of the table facing more or less the same way away
from the window behind them an image we’ll repeat often

SIOBHAN
Anything in the paper

PADRAIC
Just the civil war still

SIOBHAN

SIOBHAN makes PADRAIC put on his coat

PADRAIC
She never gets a chance cos you avoid her

SIOBHAN

PADRAIC
You hide behind walls if she’s coming
up the road

SIOBHAN gives an embarrassed laugh as PADRAIC exits She sits

Man You Don’t Meet Every Day” as a LOCAL WOMAN (40’s) sings

LOCAL WOMAN
(singing mournfully)
“Well I took out my dog and him I did
shoot all down in the County Kildare
So be easy and free when you’re
drinking with me I’m a man you meet
every day”

DOMINIC
If we sat next to Colm the women would

everyone else PADRAIC looking away sheepishly embarrassed
till COLM and the WOMAN continue with the song

PADRAIC
Here amn’t I in enough trouble with
him without your mouthing

DOMINIC
What trouble in are you in with him

PADRAIC
He just doesn’t want to be friends

Catholic paraphernalia on smoke-stained red walls DOMINIC’s
pudgy policeman father PEADAR who we met earlier asleep

as DOMINIC puts his finger to his lips for them to be quiet

he’s been wanking

then tiptoes across to his naked father quietly takes the

She washes the dishes without response and he just sits there

INT PADRAIC’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 41
In their twin beds lit by moonlight neither of them can
sleep and their clock’s deep ticking doesn’t help And is
that the sound of distant cannon-fire or thunder

EXT CHURCH - DAWN 42

Church bells peel over the island calling all to Mass

EXT LANEWAYS - DAWN 43

-And all the ISLANDERS mostly in black () trudge the
island to the sound of the bells as

EXT JETTY - DAWN 44

The local PRIEST who serves various islands steps off the
boat as it comes in and is met by PEADAR They greet each
other warmly and head up towards the church PEADAR with his
arm over the PRIEST’s shoulder Church and State entwined

EXT HIGH LANEWAYS - DAWN 45

Bells continuing ISLANDERS in background can still be seen
distantly as PADRAIC and SIOBHAN ride their pony and cart
towards church but stop upon meeting a bruised and bloody
DOMINIC

PADRAIC

DOMINIC continues on SIOBHAN gives PADRAIC an irritated
look then he cicks the pony on towards church

INT CHURCH - DAY 46

Church full of ISLANDERS as the PRIEST says Mass in Latin
SIOBHAN bored PADRAIC keeping a surreptitious eye on COLM a
few pews ahead who never looks back at him

But now PADRAIC has started noticing people glancing at him and
looking sheepishly away as well as hearing snippets of
conversation such as

MALE ISLANDER 1
Aye stopped speaking to him
Overnight like

FEMALE ISLANDER 1
Aye but wouldn’t you like

Muffled laughter coming from different places Then

FEMALE ISLANDER 2
Well he was always a bit that way
though wasn’t he

FEMALE ISLANDER 1
He was he was

PADRAIC
A bit what way

SIOBHAN
Hah

The PRIEST continues muffling any further chat until

FEMALE ISLANDER 2
Him and his little donkey

PADRAIC
(loudly)
What about me little donkey No What
about me little donkey

The whole church and even the PRIEST go quiet and in the
pause after without COLM even looking round

COLM
Stop talking about him

After another tense pause the PRIEST continues with the
mass

EXT CHURCH - DAY 47

ISLANDERS leaving church and heading home as the PRIEST shakes
a few hands to wish them well PADRAIC takes his hand sadly
whispers in his ear the PRIEST looking confused He whispers
it again and the PRIEST nods vaguely

INT CONFESSIONAL - DAY 48

COLM in a dark little room that’s revealed to be a
confessional as the PRIEST gets in the other side and opens
the latticed divider throwing a little light on him

COLM
Forgive me Father for I have sinned
It’s eight weeks since me last
confession I think

PRIEST
Go on Colm

COLM
Ah just the usual I suppose Father
The drinking and the impure thoughts
And a bit of pride I suppose Although
I never really saw that as a sin but
sure I’m here now

PRIEST
And how’s the despair

COLM
Not so much of it of late Thanks be

PRIEST
And why aren’t you talking to Padraic
Suilleabhain no more

COLM
(pause)
That wouldn’t be a sin now would it
Father

PRIEST
It wouldn’t be a sin no but it’s not
very nice either is it

COLM
Who told you
PRIEST
It’s an island Colm Word gets around
(pause)

Also Padraic asked me to put ina
word like

COLM stares blankly

COLM
I see
PRIEST
So yeah It isn’t him you have the

impure thoughts about is it

COLM
Are you joking me I mean are you
fecking joking me

This outburst can be heard by those waiting in the pews
outside

PRIEST
People do have impure thoughts about
men too

COLM

Do you have impure thoughts about men

PRIEST
I do not have impure thoughts about
men And how dare you say that about a
man of the cloth

COLM
Well you started it

PRIEST
Well you can get out of me confessional
right now so you can and I’m not
forgiving ya any of these things until
the next time so I’m not

COLM
Id better not be dying in the meantime
then eh Father I’1ll be pure fucked

PRIEST
You will be pure fucked Yes you will
be pure fucked

COLM storms out of the confessional and out of the church

EXT LANEWAY TO PUB - DAY 49

COLM angrily strides the lanes to the pub outside which
PADRAIC’s pony and cart is tied along with a few ISLANDERS in
their Sunday best They nod hello He ignores them

INT PUB - DAY 50

Pub crowded as it’s Sunday PADRAIC at bar back to
entrance talking to GERRY and JONJO as COLM comes in and slowly
crosses to them

GERRY and JONJO see him first and from their scared reactions
PADRAIC knows COLM has entered as COLM slowly comes up over
his shoulder then stands at the bar beside him
JONJO
Um pint Colm

Worried Jonjo pours the pint

COLM
(to PADRAIC)
If you don’t stop talking to me and if
you don’t stop bothering me or sending

your sister or your priest to bother me

PADRAIC
I didn’t send me sister to bother you
did I she has her own mind although
I did send the priest though you have
me there

COLM
What I’ve decided to do is this I have
a set of shears at home and each time
you bother me from this day on I will
take those shears and I’1l take one of
me fingers off with them and I will
give that finger to ya a finger from
me left hand me fiddle hand and each
day you bother me more another I’11l
take off and I’1ll give you until you
see sense enough to stop or until I’ve
no fingers left Does this make things
clearer to you

PADRAIC
Not really no

COLM
Because I don’t want to hurt your
feelings Padraic I don’t like But
it feels like the drastic is the only
option left open to me

PADRAIC
Youve loads of options left open to
ya How is fingers the first port of
call

COLM

Please don’t talk to me no more Padraic

Please Padraic I’m begging you

PADRAIC
(pause)
But

JONJO
Shush like Padraic Just yknow

(pause)

Except me and me sister were

thinking you might just be a bit

depressed Colm And I’1l tell you

this much fingers just confirms it
(pause)

Don’t you think Colm

COLM
(pause)
Starting from now

He’s serious He holds up the five fingers of his left hand
then puts a finger to his lips PADRAIC wants to say
something more but can’t accepting it perhaps with a nod and
perhaps COLM nods too COLM drinks the whole of his pint in
one and exits the bar leaving PADRAIC GERRY and JONJO stunned

JONJO
Well I’ve never heard the like

GERRY
I’ve never heard the like He must
really not like ya Padraic

JONJO
Fingers

PADRAIC
Jesus He’s serious lads

JONJO
He is serious You can see it in his
eyes he’s serious

GERRY
Just because he thinks you’re dull
Sure that’s going overboard

PADRAIC
Who told you about the dull

GERRY points at JONJO

JONJO
Well I overheard it like What was I
supposed to do I don’t think you’re
dull Jeez and if I cut something off
meself for every dull person who comes
in here I’d only have me head left

PADRAIC
Do you think I’m dull Gerry
GERRY
(slight pause)
No
(pause)
That said I did think the two of ye
always made a funny pairing like

PADRAIC
No we didn’t

JONJO
Yeah ye did

GERRY
Yeah ye did Obviously ye did cos now
he’d rather maim himself than talk to ya

JONJO
Colm was always more of a thinker

PADRAIC

GERRY

JONJO
Your sister does

GERRY
Your sister does aye Siobhan does

JONJO

He looks at them both lost desperate

JONJO
Youre more one of life’s good guys

GERRY
Youre more one of life’s good guys
aye Apart from when you’re drunk

JONJO
Apart from when you’re drunk aye

They nod in agreement

PADRAIC
I used to think that’d be a nice thing to
be one of life’s good guys Now it
sounds like the worst thing I ever heard

JONJO
Ah don’t take it like that Padraic

GERRY
Don’t take it like that Padraic We’re
on your side

PADRAIC looks at them again broken sips a bit of his pint
then leaves the half of it and exits the pub And the leaving
half of it strikes the men as very strange

EXT HIGH LANEWAYS - DAY 51

PADRAIC still bleak riding his pony and cart in drizzly rain
the whole of the island stretched out behind him and ahead
along the lane MRS MCCORMICK leaning strangely against a
wall in the drizzle hair wet pipe in mouth smiling
knowingly

PADRAIC
(as he passes)
What are you smiling at

She shrugs still smiling in the rain He continues on

EXT VARIOUS - DUSK 52

Storm-clouds and rain over various parts of the island the

SIOBHAN
No we wouldn’t

DOMINIC
That’s what I’d do I’d have him do the

SIOBHAN

DOMINIC

DOMINIC
Well touché
PADRAIC

Too wha
DOMINIC

Ché Touché It’s from the French

PADRAIC exchanges a look with SIOBHAN worried he mightve
dropped a place in the island’s dim pecking order He drifts
off again which allows

DOMINIC
Foiled again But ‘faint heart’ and
all that

DOMINIC observes the distant PADRAIC a moment and can see he’s
in a bleak place and unusually for DOMINIC it touches him

DOMINIC (CONTD)
Here Ye two ye’ll be alright

PADRAIC

DOMINIC nods kindly and PADRAIC almost smiles

A look between PEADAR and PADRAIC as PADRAIC passes and exits

EXT SHOPPOST OFFICE - DAY 59

Quickly untying his pony and cart PADRAIC sees COLM walking
along distantly saddening him somewhat just as PEADAR
strides up

PEADAR
Because of the respect I have for Mrs
O’Riordan I didn’t want to hit you in
front of her

PEADAR punches PADRAIC massively in the head and he collapses

PEADAR (CONTD)
And you can tell that skitter of a son of
mine he’d better be home be teatime or
it’s over to batter the both of ye I’11l
be and your dreary fecking sister too

PEADAR punches him a second time then walks off past the
shocked COLM

PEADAR (CONTD)
Oh hello there Colm will I see you at
Jonjo’s tonight for that pint you owe me

COLM
I owe you no
(reluctantly)
You will Peadar

PEADAR
Good man yourself

PEADAR continues away as if this is all in a day’s work
patting a passing child on the head COLM comes over to the
concussed PADRAIC helping him up as MRS MCCORMICK watches
from the shop window

COLM
Sure that man’s mad

COLM helps the dazed PADRAIC onto the cart but PADRAIC is

swaying so dizzily up there that there’s nothing to do but

hop up beside him and takes the reins himself He cicks the
pony on holding onto PADRAIC’s arm so he won’t fall off and
they head out of town

EXT HIGH LANEWAY TO CROSSROADS - DAY 60

Riding along PADRAIC mops his bloody face more or less
recovered COLM still with the reins They ride along a
while PADRAIC knowing he can’t say anything but wanting to
COLM knowing how awkward all this is

PADRAIC glances at him a few times then starts heaving
with massive uncontrollable sobs COLM tries to ignore it
but it’s terribly sad They ride on that way for what seems
like an eternity then COLM gradually slows the pony down and
stops the cart at a crossroads

He gently takes PADRAIC’s hand and it almost feels as if he
might hug him and PADRAIC certainly wants him to but
instead COLM gently places the reins in PADRAIC’s hand pats
that hand gets off the cart and slowly walks away head
bowed down the right fork of the crossroads marked by a
small blue statue of Mary arms outstretched

PADRAIC cries even harder watching COLM’s back as he gets
further away then cicks the pony on taking the left hand
fork towards home

EXT COLM’S HOUSE - DAY 61
On a chair on the grass overlooking the bay sits COLM

smoking thinking his dog looking at him He takes his
fiddle plays a beautiful second part to his new composition

It ends abruptly that’s all there is to it but he’s okay
with it He sits smoking some more happier now

EXT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - DAY 62

PADRAIC in doorway DOMINIC waves goodbye with half a loaf and
heads off sadly PADRAIC watches him go equally sad His
little donkey comes up seeking entry PADRAIC glances around
for SIOBHAN then lets her in

INT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - DAY 63

PADRAIC sitting in a corner on the floor cut lip face
bruised and even his donkey investigating the house

rubbing her nose against doilies and such can’t cheer

PADRAIC today

But then finally the donkey trots over to PADRAIC and he
can’t help but give her a happy rub and a cuddle

PADRAIC
What’s that Jenny Will we go to the
pub for ourselves We shall d’you
know Who are them to rule the roost

They head out together cheerfully

EXT HIGH LANEWAYS (OR ANYWHERE) - DUSK 64

massively behind them

INT PUB - DUSK 65

COLM and PEADAR at a side table GERRY some other REGULARS and
MRS MCCORMICK leaning strangely against the bar and
DOMINIC hunched at one end of it avoiding his father A
coin hits his head thrown across the bar by PEADAR

PEADAR
One drink you’re having lady then
it’s off home with ya I’ve a shirt
that wants ironing for the morning

DOMINIC
Okay Daddy
PEADAR
(to COLM)

Aye off to the mainland in the morning

COLM’s mind is elsewhere

PEADAR (CONTD)
And why are you off to the mainland in
the morning Peadar Oh thanks for
asking Colm I’ll tell ya why They’ve
asked for extra manpower for a couple

of the
(whispered)

-executions
(normal)

they’re having in case there’s any
kind of a to-do like Six bob and a
free lunch they’re paying me and sure
I’d’ve gone for nothing I’ve always
wanted to see an execution haven’t
you Although Id have preferred a
hanging

COLM
Who are they executing

PEADAR

The Free State lads are executing a
couple of the IRA lads

(pause)
Or is it the other way around I find
it hard to follow these days Wasn’t it
so much easier when we was all on the
same side and it was just the English
we was killing I think it was I
preferred it

COLM
But you don’t care who’s executing who

PEADAR
For six bob and a free lunch I don’t
care They could be executing you Why
don’t you come with me You could write
a miserable fecking song about it

PEADAR laughs COLM giving him a look
PEADAR (CONTD)
I’m only messing
EXT PUB - DUSKNIGHT 66
PADRAIC arrives outside to the sound of music Sees COLM’s
dog out there and as he ties his donkey loosely to a post the
donkey and the dog old friends give each other a lick and a

nuzzle and it breaks PADRAIC’s heart

Although after a second it just makes him angry He enters

INT PUB - NIGHT 67A

Bar quite full COLM is playing fiddle along with some
STUDENT MUSICIANS one on accordion one on tin whistle or
fiddle and a handsome one DECLAN on fiddle PADRAIC is at
bar on his 5th or 6th whisky and JONJO is already worried

PADRAIC
Who are them

JONJO
Music students I think from
Lisdoonvarna

COLM shows DECLAN a new chord on the fiddle or accordion
placing his fingers in the correct places and PADRAIC
watches almost jealously before the band continue

PADRAIC
He used to try to teach me them things
once but I could never figure them

JONJO
What things

PADRAIC
Chords (But pronounced WITH THE ‘H’
as in CHALK)

JONJO gives him a sad look

PADRAIC (CONTD)
Another whisky anyways Jonjo

JONJO
Jeez you’re going at it at a fair oul
lick tonight Padraic

PADRAIC
And whatever anybody else wants apart
from that man
(indicates COLM)
And apart from that man
(indicates PEADAR)

GERRY
Jeez thanks Padraic and you leave him
alone Jonjo he can drink as quick as he
likes can’t he if he’s paying I’1l have
a triple whiskey Jonjo

PADRAIC and GERRY clink glassesbottle and PADRAIC knocks his
whisky back in one then turns leans back against the bar
and stares at COLM hatefully

LATER DECLAN has taken COLM’s place in the session 67B
as COLM is chatting quietly to PEADAR again

PADRAIC observes them the betrayal of it perhaps in SLOWMO
as he gets drunker and drunker enough to concern DOMINIC

DOMINIC
How are you doing there Padraic Don’t
you think we should be heading home for
ourselves

PADRAIC gently puts his hand on DOMINIC’s face and playfully
pushes it away but PADRAIC’s eyes have gone to the dark
side and he slowly ambles over to COLM and PEADAR

DOMINIC (CONTD)
Ah Padraic don’t now

and PADRAIC puts his finger to his lips as he stares them
down the two big men just looking at him

JONJO
(to DOMINIC in bg)
Go get Siobhan Dominic would ya

DOMINIC dashes out of the pub

PEADAR
What are you after gobshite Another
beating is it

PADRAIC
You copper I’m allowed to chat to

This stumps PADRAIC for a moment

PADRAIC
Hah Well anyways do you want to

PEADAR

PADRAIC raises his hand and starts to count on his fingers

With the loudness of this the music slowly stops as the
tension rises
EXT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 68

DOMINIC rushes the final laneway and gets to PADRAIC’s house
knocks on the door SIOBHAN opening it quickly

DOMINIC
Padraic’s out of his brains on whisky

SIOBHAN rushes out with him

COLM
Ah well I suppose niceness just

But shall I tell ya something that does

PADRAIC

COLM
(overlapping)
Music lasts
PADRAIC

COLM

And paintings last And poetry lasts

PADRAIC
So does niceness

SIOBHAN and DOMINIC come in JONJO gesturing for SIOBHAN to
wait a moment and not go steaming in

COLM
Do you know who we remember for how
nice they was in the 17th Century

PADRAIC
Who

COLM
Absolutely no-one Yet we all remember
the music of the time Everyone to a
man knows Mozart’s name

PADRAIC
Well I don’t so there goes that theory
And anyways were talking about
niceness not whatsisname My Mammy she
was nice I remember her And my Daddy
he was nice I remember him And my
sister she’s nice I’1ll remember her

This touches SIOBHAN as it’s something she’s never heard him
say before

COLM
And who else will

PADRAIC
Who else will what

COLM
Remember Siobhan and yere niceness No-
one will In fifty years time no-one
will remember any of us Yet the music
of a man who lived two centuries ago

PADRAIC
“Yet” he says like he’s fecking
English It’ll be “Parameters” next

SIOBHAN goes over to him takes his arm gently

PADRAIC (CONTD)
I don’t give a feck about Mozart or
Borvoven or any of them funny name

I’m nice

SIOBHAN
Come home Padraic

PADRAIC starts to go then

PADRAIC
(Re PEADAR)
So you’d rather be friends with this
fella would ya A fella who beats his
own son black and blue every night that
he’s not fiddling with him

This takes PEADAR aback somewhat as it does Dominic

DOMINIC
(blushing embarrassed)
I never told him that Daddy He’s just
drunk now
69A

PADRAIC
(to COLM)
You used to be nice Or did you never
used to be

They look at each other a moment

PADRAIC (CONTD)
Oh God Maybe you never used to be

Saddened by the realisation PADRAIC backs up and staggers
out DOMINIC heads blushing to a far corner and SIOBHAN is
left facing COLM alone

SIOBHAN
I’1l have a word with him Colm You
don’t need to do anything drastic He
won’t be bothering you no more

COLM
That’s a shame That was the most
interesting he’s ever been I think I
like him again now

Laughter from the bar at this then SIOBHAN turns back to
COLM

SIOBHAN
It was the 18th Century anyways
Mozart You said the 17th

They stare at each other a moment then she exits and all is
still quiet in the pub

COLM
Well play a fecking tune will ya for
Christ’s sake
The band strikes up again COLM gives PEADAR a look then

takes his empty pint glass to the bar and PEADAR looks
daggers at the distant DOMINIC who sheepishly looks away

Awaking to a dreadful hangover and SIOBHAN not there PADRAIC
goes to the kitchen almost vomiting He wets a towel wraps
it round his head Looks at the calendar - the days have been
ticked off to April 5th which is marked “Mam and Dad’s” The
water drips down his sickly face

INT SHOPPOST OFFICE - DAWN 72

Still raining outside as SIOBHAN in the shawl with the rose

MRS O’RIORDAN

SIOBHAN

ORiordan I’ve no time to talk I’m

MRS O’RIORDAN
(a look)
A letter came for you

MRS O’RIORDAN hands her a stamped green envelope SIOBHAN
notices it has already been carefully steamed open

SIOBHAN
Fell open did it

MRS O’RIORDAN
Aye in the heat I suppose

SIOBHAN glances at the cold rain pelting the window then
steps away from MRS O’RIORDAN and reads the letter with her
back to her MRS O’RIORDAN itching to talk about it

MRS O’RIORDAN (CONTD)
A job offer is it

SIOBHAN glances at her a second then returns to the letter
infuriating MRS O’RIORDAN no end

MRS O’RIORDAN (CONTD)
A job offer from a library on the
mainland is it

SIOBHAN quietly folds the letter away
SIOBHAN
Just the rashers please Mrs O’Riordan

About ten of them

MRS O’RIORDAN stares fuming wrapping the rashers and
slapping them into SIOBHAN’s hand

MRS O’RIORDAN
You never tell me anything

SIOBHAN takes the rashers and goes to head out

MRS O’RIORDAN (CONTD)
Well it’d crucify him your leaving

SIOBHAN stops in the doorway

SIOBHAN
No-one’s leaving

She continues out

SIOBHAN (CONTD)
(quietly to herself)
No-one ever leaves

EXT GRAVEYARD - MORNING 73

Trudging up the wild graveyard that overlooks the sea
wildflowers in hand towel still around his head still sick
he gets to his parents grave a plain stone for Micheal and
Bridie Suilleabhain who both died 5 April 1915

PADRAIC
Ye were nice

As he lays the flowers against the stone he vomits slightly
on the grass of the grave then cleans it away with his shoe

PADRAIC (CONTD)
I’m sorry Mammy

He sighs at length then his gaze is drawn to a boat that’s
heading from Inisherin to the mainland on the back of which
in dress uniform stands PEADAR staring back at PADRAIC

EXT BOAT - MORNING 74

And PEADAR makes a slow slit throat gesture with his
finger towards PADRAIC

EXT GRAVEYARD - MORNING 75

PADRAIC only now remembers that bit about the night before
and puts his head in his hands as a dog’s bark draws his
attention to the beach below and the dark figure of a man and
his dog playfully scampering around him the man not paying
it much attention as he stares out to sea It’s COLM

PADRAIC has a long think about whether to go down and join
him or to leave him well enough alone

EXT BEACH BY GRAVEYARD - MORNING

COLM on beach barefoot staring out to sea as PADRAIC

approaches in background COLM’s dog runs up the beach to
greet him drawing COLM’s attention PADRAIC gives COLM a
little wave as he greets the dog COLM turns back to the sea

in disbelief

PADRAIC
Listen I didn’t come down to chat

night was just the whisky talking Colm

COLM
All what last night

PADRAIC
All whatever it was I was saying

COLM

Padraic

PADRAIC
Hah

COLM

PADRAIC
I know I was just

COLM
I mean why can’t you just leave me

COLM puts his face in his hands breathing panicked maybe
even crying and PADRAIC doesn’t know what to do or say so
he awkwardly half hugs half pats him on the back

COLM (CONTD)
What are ya doing

PADRAIC
I don’t know

COLM
For fuck’s sake like Hugging

PADRAIC
I wasn’t

PADRAIC awkwardly lets him gois shrugged off and moves back
along the beach as COLM regains control of himself looking
out to sea shaking his head After a few paces PADRAIC
stops and turns back to him

PADRAIC (CONTD)
How’s the tune coming along I bet it’s
good be now

COLM doesn’t answer PADRAIC is left hanging a while goes to
say something else then thinks better of it He waves the
dog goodbye and continues away from COLM and the beach

77 INT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - DAY 77

PADRAIC on a chair staring into space rain outside There’s
a sound of quiet chomping the donkey is eating a carrot from
his hand but PADRAIC is too hungover and depressed to enjoy
it SIOBHAN returns groceries and letter in hand

SIOBHAN
Ar for Gods sake Padraic how many
more times

PADRAIC
I am not putting me donkey out in
the rain when I’m sad Okay

SIOBHAN
Well stringy bits of shite I had to pick
up yesterday when you let her in

PADRAIC
There was no stringy bits in that
donkey’s shite There was bits of
straw if there was anything and
that’s all there was

SIOBHAN
Maybe it was straw so

PADRAIC
It was straw

Seeing how sad he is she softens a little

SIOBHAN
I’ll get us our porridge

SIOBHAN puts the groceries and letter to one side and warms
some porridge on the stove

PADRAIC
Was I awful last night

SIOBHAN
No you was lovely

PADRAIC
Well I know I wasn’t lovely now Siobhan

SIOBHAN
You was lovely About me anyways

PADRAIC
Well of course I’m lovely about you
What else is there to be about ya

Touched she gives him a smile then goes back to the
porridge She looks at the letter a moment then slips it
quietly away into a pocket Suddenly there is a single quiet
thump on the front door PADRAIC glances at SIOBHAN then
goes over and opens it

EXT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 78

No-one outside confusing PADRAIC until he sees a couple of
fields away

POV - COLM climbing a wall traversing a field and climbing
another wall heading away from the house something white on
his hand

And as PADRAIC watches him get further away still confused
we notice over PADRAIC’s shoulder in the middle of the green
front door a small blood-spatter which as PADRAIC goes to
close the door he notices too and is startled by

EXT FIELD - CONTINUOUS 79

And as COLM continues across the field his face blank the
distant house and PADRAIC framed behind him we see that
there’s a white handkerchief wrapped around his left hand a
stain of blood seeping through the spot where his index
finger used to be

EXT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 80
-Just as PADRAIC’s gaze drifts from the distant COLM down
to a patch of grass below his door that he now notices is
also flecked with blood

And we move in on PADRAIC and his horrified reaction as he
parts the blades of grass to reveal COLM’S index finger lying
there

EXT FIELD - CONTINUOUS 81
--As COLM scales another wall seemingly unperturbed by the
finger loss and continues away along the lane

INT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 82
PADRAIC ashen comes back inside the finger behind him

SIOBHAN
What was that a bird

PADRAIC
(pause)
What was what

SIOBHAN
The bang at the door

PADRAIC thinks a long while unable to lie

PADRAIC
A bird

SIOBHAN
Aye

PADRAIC

SIOBHAN stops stirring bemused by this behaviour

SIOBHAN
What was it so

PADRAIC
(pause)
The bang at the door

SIOBHAN
Aye

PADRAIC
What was the bang at the door

She gives him a look

PADRAIC (CONTD)

Err it was err hard to lie it

SIOBHAN smiles confused then loses her smile

SIOBHAN

PADRAIC

PADRAIC holds out the bloody finger and she screams in
horror frightening the donkey

PADRAIC (CONTD)
Jesus Siobhan youll frighten the
little fella

SIOBHAN
Throw it out Throw it out Padraic

PADRAIC
I’m not throwing his finger out It’1l

PADRAIC goes through to another room as SIOBHAN stands there
in shock PADRAIC returns cleaning the blood off his hands
with the towel from earlier

SIOBHAN
Where’d you put it

Shears standing in the corner blood on the blades as we
hear the sound of a dog licking something then reveal COLM
smoking in the same position as the first scene staring into
space as the dog cleans off the blood from the dripping hole
in COLM’s hand

After a moment he picks his fiddle up and through the pain
plays another part of his new tune It’s lovely

EXT COLM’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 84

abruptly hang the fiddle up on the wall and exit to his
room leaving the fiddle and the blood-soaked shears framed
perfectly in the rain-lashed window

INT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - DAY 86

Blood seeps thru the bottom of the shoebox that the donkey is
sniffing at till PADRAIC pushes it out of nose’s reach

SIOBHAN grimaces unable to eat her porridge PADRAIC halfway
thru his unaffected glancing in at the finger now and then

SIOBHAN
Do we have to have it in here while
were eating

PADRAIC
Once the rain stops Ill bring it back
to him

SIOBHAN

Are you fecking stupid I mean are

fecking finger off and thrown it at ya

PADRAIC
Come on it wasn’t at me

She pulls her shawl on grabs the shoebox and walks out the
front door slamming it PADRAIC gives the donkey a look
then goes to the window and watches her striding away

As SIOBHAN walks along the beach towards COLM’s shoebox
under arm a stunning sunset striking the water she’s
suddenly stopped by the sound of a distant volley of rifle-
fire coming from the mainland - FIVE SHOTS all at the same
time as if from a FIRING SQUAD A pause then another five

shots Perturbed she continues on

COLM
Hurt awful to begin with I thought I was
going to faint But funny it feels fine
now in all the excitement Would you
like a cup of tea

SIOBHAN
I won’t Colm I only came up to give
you your finger back

COLM nods and looks out the window at the pretty sunset skies
Pause

COLM
It’s cleared up quite nice actually
And you wouldn’t have thought it would

SIOBHAN
What do you need from him Colm To end
all this

COLM
Silence Siobhan Just silence

SIOBHAN
One more silent man on Inisherin
good-oh Silence it is so

She gets up to go

COLM
This isn’t about Inisherin This is
about one boring man leaving another
man alone that’s all

SIOBHAN
‘One boring man” Ye’re all fecking
boring With your piddling grievances
over nothing Ye’re all fecking boring

PADRAIC keeps his eyes lowered as much as he can but just as

surreptitiously glancing over at COLM who sometimes makes a
note in a notebook sometimes glances out the window but
never looks in PADRAIC’s direction

After a while the student musician DECLAN enters joins
COLM at his table and they chat jovially for a time After
sadly watching this a while PADRAIC quietly finishes his
pint returns the glass to the bar shakes his head that he
doesn’t need another and leaves the pub

behind COLM and DECLAN looking back at them but neither pay
him any attention as they chat PADRAIC continues away

Walking the misty lane PADRAIC sees MRS MCCORMICK distantly
coming towards him head stooped so he ducks into a field
behind a graveyard wall and hides there till her footsteps pass
and get more and more distant

He slowly peaks up above the wall and is startled at the
sight of her standing right there staring at him

PADRAIC
Oh hello there Mrs McCormick I was
just looking for me thing I dropped

MCCORMICK has a faraway look in her eyes

MRS MCCORMICK
A death shall come to Inisherin afore

MRS MCCORMICK
Maybe even two deaths

PADRAIC
Two deaths jeez Well that’d be sad

over her shoulder as she goes

MRS MCCORMICK
We shall pray to the Lord ‘tis neither
you nor poor Siobhan will be either
of them

PADRAIC
Well is that a nice thing to be saying

Hah Well aye it was a bit mean

finds his daddy hasn’t been hit be a
bread van And how can that be the
meanest thing you ever heard Your
Daddy killed a little Japanese man

DOMINIC
I used to think you were the nicest of
them Turns out you’re just the same as
them

PADRAIC
I am the nicest of them

DOMINIC
I thought you were a happy lad

PADRAIC
I am a happy lad

DOMINIC shakes his head sadly as he heads away

PADRAIC (CONTD)
Ar Dominic now
(calling out)
Well maybe I’m not a happy lad so
Maybe being a happy lad just doesn’t
cut the custard any more

DOMINIC
(to himself quietly)
Mustard
(or just a wince)

PADRAIC
Maybe this is the new me

DOMINIC glances back sadly then continues on PADRAIC
notices DOMINIC has left his bottle behind so he drinks a
big gulp

PADRAIC (CONTD)
Aye Maybe this is the new me

-then walks away with it in the opposite direction
drinking

EXT BEACH - DAY 104

COLM’s house framed high above him PADRAIC strides along the
misty beach finishes the last of the poteen to keep his
anger up tosses the bottle out into the thunderous surf
then heads straight up the bank and on towards COLM’s house
it’s chimney smoking

106 EXT LAKE - DAY 106

SIOBHAN stands at the foggy banks of the lonely lake looking
across at its bleak grey water then looks down at her feet
that are being lapped by the water her shoes in her hand

Across the water she now notices MRS MCCORMICK outside her
desolate shack on the distant opposite bank staring back at
us sitting on or standing on a red chair

The old woman slowly and strangely waves and just as SIOBHAN
is about to wave back MCCORMICK’s wave turns into something
more of a beckoning striking SIOBHAN as creepy just as
DOMINIC suddenly appears beside SIOBHAN startling her

DOMINIC
Howdo

SIOBHAN
Jesus Christ Dominic Would you ever
stop creeping up on people You almost
gave me a fecking heart attack

DOMINIC
I wasn’t creeping up on ya I was

sidling up on ya

SIOBHAN
Between you and that ghoul Jesus

DOMINIC
I always call her a ghoul too Because
she is a ghoul Jeez we have a lot in
common don’t we Calling oul people
ghouls and that

SIOBHAN gives him a look as she dries her feet puts her
shoes back on

DOMINIC (CONTD)
Were you having a little paddle for
yourself Or were you just cleaning off
the muck from them

Another look as she gets to her feet

DOMINIC (CONTD)
This is a great oul lake isn’t it All
the water in it and that Em I’m
glad I caught you actually because
there was something I was wanting to
ask you actually And jeez
discovering how much we have in common
well it just makes me want to ask you
even more

SIOBHAN
We don’t have anything in common

DOMINIC
What I was don’t skip ahead What
I was wanting to ask you was Jeez

it’s cold isn’t it Your bony little
feet must’ve been freezing Yeah what
I was wanting to ask you was
something along the lines of
should’ve planned this but what I was
wanting to ask you was You probably
wouldn’t ever want to I don’t
know to fall in love with a boy like
me would ya

SIOBHAN looks at him and there’s such an earnestness a
sadness yet a desperate hope in his eyes that it doesn’t
warrant any kind of harshness

SIOBHAN
Oh Dominic I don’t think so love
DOMINIC
No yeah no I was thinking No
(pause)

Not even in the future like Like
when I’m your age

She shakes her head as kindly as she can

DOMINIC (CONTD)

Yeah no I didn’t think so but I just
thought I’d ask on the off-chance
like yknow Feint heart and all that

(pause)
Well there goes that dream

pause)
Well I’d best go over there and do
whatever that thing over there I was
going to do was

DOMINIC heads off around the lake then calls out

DOMINIC (CONTD)
Oh Siobhan I think you’d best go find
Padraic Before he does anything
stupid

He waves then carries on around the lake SIOBHAN watches
him go sadly noticing that MRS MCCORMICK is now gone her
empty chair left behind SIOBHAN heads away herself in the
opposite direction

INT COLM’S HOUSE - DAY 107

COLM is dancing hand in hand with his dog as he sings an old

Irish song “Aghadoe” the dog reluctant

COLM
singing)
“IT walked from Mallow Town to Aghadoe
Aghadoe”
to Sammy )

“I took his head from the gaol gate to
Aghadoe”
to Sammy )
That’s it
singing)
“There I covered him with fern and I
piled on him the cairn”

EXT COLM’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 108

We see PADRAIC watching all this from outside the window his
heart leaping at the joy of the sight of them and he seems
to think better of it all and walks away from the window

COLM
(singing)
“Like an Irish king he sleeps in
Aghadoe”

INT COLM’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 109

And COLM is just giving the dog a kiss at the end of the song
and the dance

-when PADRAIC kicks the door open startling them as they
stand there hands in paws

PADRAIC
How are you fatty Dancing with your
dog is it Well who else is going to
dance with ya Your poor dog has no say
in the matter And if you’re too rude
to be offering me a seat I’1l be
taking one of me own accord

COLM can only stand there stunned as PADRAIC sits

PADRAIC (CONTD)
Now how’s that for an oul hello

COLM
Have you gone fecking mental

PADRAIC looks thru COLM’s telescope at COLM a moment (POV)

PADRAIC
Have I gone fecking mental No I
haven’t gone fecking mental actually
(MORE )

PADRAIC (CONTD)
And not only have I not gone fecking
mental I have ten fingers to prove
I’ve not gone fecking mental How many
fingers do you have to prove youve not
gone fecking mental

COLM
(pause)
Nine fingers

PADRAIC
Nine fingers And nine fingers is the
epitome of mental

COLM gives him a look of surprise at the word

PADRAIC (CONTD)
That’s right the epitome

COLM sits opposite him trying to keep himself in check but
also bewildered The dog gives PADRAIC a lick and he likes
it at first smiling then pulls his hand away

PADRAIC (CONTD)
There’1l be none of that I didn’t come
here for licks I came here for the
opposite of licks

COLM

What’s the opposite of licks
PADRAIC

Hah
COLM

What did you come here for

PADRAIC
I didn’t come here for anything did I
I just came here to kick your door in
and give you a slagging

COLM
Well you’ve done that so you can go
now

PADRAIC

Haven’t finished yet have I Well
I’ve finished with your door I havent
finished with your slagging

COLM

COLM
No there isn’t

PADRAIC
It takes two to Tango

COLM
I don’t want to Tango

PADRAIC
Well you danced with your dog

Pause and a moment of calm finally for both of them
PADRAIC (CONTD)

Talking of Tangos how’s your new tune
coming along

COLM
I just finished it actually This
minute

PADRAIC

(thrilled for him)
Did ya No Colm That’s great like

COLM
That’s why I was dancing with me dog I
don’t usually dance with me dog

PADRAIC
There’s no harm in dancing with your
dog I’d dance with me donkey if I knew
how And she did
(pause)
Is it good Your tune

COLM nods solemnly almost disconcertingly convinced of how
good it is a conviction that PADRAIC gets strangely

PADRAIC (CONTD)
What’s it called
COLM
“The Banshees Of Inisherin” I was

thinking
PADRAIC
But there are no banshees on Inisherin
COLM
I know I just like the double SH
sounds
PADRAIC
Aye there’s plenty of double SH on
Inisherin
COLM

And maybe there are banshees too I
just don’t think they scream to portend
death any more I think they just sit
back amused and observe

PADRAIC
Portend

Pause COLM nods Pause

COLM
Yeah I keep having thoughts of playing it
for you at your funeral But that wouldn’t
be fair on either of us would it

Hurt by that but not quite sure why PADRAIC can only
plough on through

PADRAIC
Well that’s great that you’ve finished
your tune That’s more than great
Thats really great Isn’t it

COLM nods slightly

PADRAIC (CONTD)
So do you want to meet me down the
pub Colm We could celebrate your
tune like

The clock strikes two and PADRAIC points to it a happy
surprised smile as COLM processes all this rolling a
ciggie

PADRAIC (CONTD)
Only if you like like But I could run
up ahead Order them in

COLM
Why don’t you do that Padraic
109A

PADRAIC
Why don’t I run up a And order
them Well I will so

PADRAIC stands thrilled gives the dog a pat

PADRAIC (CONTD)
Jeez that went well And maybe on the
way I can find that student friend of
yours that Declan fella I’d told him
his Daddy was dying so he’d feck off
home and leave us alone but there’s no
need now Sure he could join us

PADRAIC ruffles COLM’s hair on the way out We see him happily
striding away thru the window COLM stares into space

INT COLM’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 109A

dust as his dog quietly gets up stretches nonchalantly
pads over to the blood-stained shears that are leaning
against a wall takes one of the handles in his mouth and
drags them away towards the open front door glancing back
sheepishly at COLM as he goes

COLM smiles puts his cigarette out goes over to him gives
him a big loving pat and a rub and takes the shears away
from him and heads upstairs

INT PUB - DAY 110
Only JONJO in there as PADRAIC enters

PADRAIC
Two pints please Jonjo

- which confuses JONJO though he doesn’t rise to it as he
pours the pints PADRAIC nods a thanks and heads over to
COLM’s table by the window

JONJO
What are you sitting over there for
when I’m over here

PADRAIC shrugs sipping his pint

PADRAIC
I thought I’d just have a sit for
meself yknow
(pause)
Wait for me friend

JONJO
Are you fecking joking me Your four-
fingered friend I mean are you

PADRAIC

JONJO is just left there flabbergasted as PADRAIC sits
there happily looking out the window

EXT COLM’S HOUSE - DAY 111
AS A DENSE FOG ROLLS IN COLM leaves his house walking away
up the lane his dog barking from inside the window

INT PUB - DAY 112
PADRAIC still waiting impatiently now AS THE CLOCK STRIKES

FOUR Sound of footsteps to the pub door and PADRAIC resets
himself then the door opens and SIOBHAN comes in

JONJO

She nods stands and heads out PADRAIC looks at COLM’s
untouched pint looks at JONJO and follows her out the two
lonely pints left behind

INT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - DAY 113

No-one at home wind blowing in SLOWMO the curtains of the
open window thru which we see COLM approaching the house
along the foggy lane He stops and throws something at the
door and it hits with a thud

EXT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 114

Over COLM’s shoulder he throws another thing at the already
bloody door and the next of his fingers slides down it

He throws the next then throws the thumb

EXT HIGH LANEWAYS - DAY 115

PADRAIC following SIOBHAN through the fog as she strides
along

PADRAIC
But what about me

SIOBHAN
What about you

PADRAIC
I’1l have no friends at all left

SIOBHAN
You’1l have Dominic

PADRAIC
Ah here And he’s gone off me now too
What kind of a place is it when the
village gom goes off ya
(pause)
And who’s going to do the cooking

SIOBHAN
That’s your first question is it
“Who’s going to do the cooking”

PADRAIC
Well it wasn’t me first question was
it “But what about me” was me first
question

She gives him a look and just then

OUT OF THE SWIRLING FOG COLM distantly appears perhaps in
SLOWMO clambering over walls and thru fields a strange
lonesome figure getting closer to them but there’s something
weird or lopsided about him

PADRAIC waves and goes to call out but SIOBHAN stops him as
it’s only now that they see the blood pouring from his left
hand all its fingers gone

SIOBHAN
Oh God no

As COLM clambers painfully over the wall onto the lane
they’re on falls gets up approaches and passes them
without even acknowledging their presence

And they watch him go appalled at the fingerless bloody
hand and the blood-trail it’s left as he gets further away
clambers over another wall and disappears into the fog
SLOWMO ending

EXT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - DAY 116
PADRAIC’s door with the blood-spatters SIOBHAN winces at
it and they look around the grass for where the fingers may
have fallen but can’t see anything in the fog Confused
they go into the house

INT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - DAY 117

SIOBHAN is putting the final few things in her suitcase to
PADRAIC’s dismay

PADRAIC
Now But you can’t be leaving now

SIOBHAN
I can be leaving now I can’t be waiting
round for any more of this madness
(pause)
What did you say to him Padraic

PADRAIC
Nothing really

She gives him a look

PADRAIC (CONTD)
Well I’d sort of had a chat with
Dominic earlier and a new sort of tack
we thought I should try

SIOBHAN
Oh God

PADRAIC
More of a standing up for meself sort
of tack Well it was all going fine
until he chopped off all his fingers

SIOBHAN shakes her head shuts her suitcase and looks over the
house one last time tearfully

SIOBHAN
Me books wouldn’t fit Would you look
after them for me

PADRAIC
Ar don’t go Siobhan

SIOBHAN
They’re all I have really Apart from
the obvious

For a split second he can’t work out what that is but then
he does and they hug tearfully

PADRAIC
You’1l be back soon wont ya Siobhan

SIOBHAN
Oh Padraic

PADRAIC
Dont say “Oh Padraic” Say yes

She sobs then smiles thru her tears grabs her suitcase and
leaves and PADRAIC watches her go from the window up the
misty lane to the bend where she waves back at him

EXT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 118

And from the bend she looks back at him and their house and
the cows calf and pony all watching from outside the rest
of the island stretching out behind them all and she takes
the bend in the road and she’s gone

EXT JETTY - DAY 119

Ferry putters in BOATMAN on the back of it securing the
gangplank as SIOBHAN waits on the jetty surprised to see a
young man with his own suitcase DECLAN waiting too crying
quietly

Concerned but shy about it she lets him on ahead of her he
nods a gentle thanks and she follows him on the boat pulling
away DECLAN goes inside but SIOBHAN stands out at the back
taking a last look at Inisherin as it recedes from view

EXT BOAT - DAY 120

As the boat passes the high cliff side of the island SIOBHAN
gazes up them and is surprised to see at the top edge near
the castle ruins PADRAIC sadly waving goodbye

She waves back tearfully but happy that he came out till
PADRAIC slowly stops waving and just stands there SIOBHAN
loses her smile somewhat

EXT CASTLE RUINS - CONTINUOUS 121

A shot from behind PADRAIC scarily close to the cliff edge
the tiny figure of SIOBHAN far off on the distant boat A
shadow of a large bird or something flits strangely across
his back

EXT BOAT - CONTINUOUS 122

SIOBHAN still looking up at the unmoving figure of PADRAIC
concerned that he’s still on the edge especially as she now
sees the slightly ominous figure of MRS MCCORMICK further
along the cliff top staring back at him

but SIOBHAN’s relief is palpable once PADRAIC waves one
last time steps away from the cliff edge and disappears
inland She looks along the cliff face and MRS MCCORMICK is
no longer there either

SIOBHAN takes a last look at the empty cliffs and the
beautiful home she’s leaving

EXT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - DAY 123

We follow PADRAIC towards his house and up its path till he
sees again the blood patch on the front door and though
there’s still nothing on the grass below with the fog now
gone he now notices a little TRAIL OF BLOOD that leads away
from the door and around the corner of the house

--and as we slowly follow PADRAIC around the corner and
BECOME HIS POV

we reveal first the TAIL then the BACK HOOVES then THE
MOTIONLESS LITTLE BODY OF HIS DWARF DONKEY a human THUMB and
a little pool of bloody vomit in the grass around her
lifeless mouth as PADRAIC collapses to his knees beside her

He touches her mane he cradles her neck he pulls her onto
his lap he pulls out a human finger that’s stuck in her
throat but it’s no use she’s long gone The cows the pony
and even his calf stand around watching in sad silence also
knowing she’s gone

EXT VARIOUS - DUSK 124

Sunset across the island at some pretty spots we’ve seen
before including the castle ruins and gloomy cemetery

INT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - DUSK 125

Sun still setting the animals look in the window curtains
billowing in the breeze as PADRAIC sits in his chair donkey
corpse across his lap He looks at SIOBHAN’s empty chair

EXT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - DUSK 126

Lit by lamplight the animals stand watching as PADRAIC digs
a grave in the grass behind his house Beside the grave the
donkey has been delicately wrapped in SIOBHAN’s rose shawl
(or PADRAIC’S patchwork quilt)

The grave dug he gently picks her up and places her down
inside it stays kneeling there and says a tearful silent
prayer for her Then he gently shovels the earth down on her
as the other animals look away

PADRAIC
(Aye I wish I could look away too)

INT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - NIGHT 127
Hands still dirty and bloody PADRAIC pulls a black jacket over
his white shirt does up his funeral tie in the cracked
mirror grabs an oil lamp smashes the mirror with it and

leaves the house And from the open window we watch IN SLOWMO
as he heads up the lane the curtains billowing creepily

EXT LANEWAYS - NIGHT 128

PADRAIC trudging along overtakes the slow-moving MCCORMICK

PADRAIC
I don’t want to talk

And just as PADRAIC thinks he’s gotten away from her

MRS MCCORMICK
Don’t be killing his dog now

PADRAIC
And don’t be putting things in me head that
weren’t there in the first fecking place
Ya fecking nutbag
MCCORMICK chuckles as PADRAIC continues on

MRS MCCORMICK

(smiling)
“Nutbag”
INT COLM’S HOUSE - NIGHT 129

Moonlit but no-one at home bar COLM’s dog It’s awoken by
PADRAIC’s lamplit face at the window looking in He leaves
it and comes in thru the door the dog giving a whimper as
PADRAIC checks if COLM’s home then sits beside him

He rubs its head it gives him a lick then PADRAIC’s gaze
drifts across to the bloody shears that are lying in a pool
of blood on the table His gaze returns to the dog who meets
it PADRAIC smiles rubbing the dog’s ears

PADRAIC
What would I ever hurt you for
(pause)
Youre the only nice thing about him

INT PUB - NIGHT 130
JONJO and GERRY are quite concerned at COLM’s bleeding hand

but COLM seems happier than he’s ever been as he guides the
disturbed STUDENT MUSICIAN’s thru his tune

COLM
No it’s more

He plucks the tune out on one of their fiddles with his good
hand then hands the fiddle back covered in blood The
STUDENT repeats the tune squeamishly as COLM whistles along

OMITTED 131

INT PUB - NIGHT 132

Just then PADRAIC enters and JONJO and GERRY look at the
dishevelled bloodied ashen sight of him worried

GERRY
Hiya there Padraic You’re looking well

The MUSICIANS now notice him and slowly stop playing which
prompts COLM to finally notices PADRAIC too

COLM
Keep playing lads It sounds lovely

They quietly start up again as COLM goes over to PADRAIC
his hand gently dripping as he goes

COLM (CONTD)
I don’t need your apologies Alright
It’s a relief to me So let’s just call
it quits and agree to go our separate
ways shall we For good this time

COLM’s right hand is offered PADRAIC just looks at it

PADRAIC
Your fat fingers killed me little
donkey today So no we won’t call it
quits We’ll call it the start

COLM
(face falling)
You’re joking me

PADRAIC
Yeah no I’m not joking you So tomorrow
Sunday God’s day around two I’m going to
call up to your house and I’m going to set
fire to it and hopefully you’1l still be
inside it But I won’t be checking either way

Or you can do whatever’s in your power
to stop me
(pause)

133A

PADRAIC (CONTD)
To our graves we’re taking this

To one of our graves anyways

PADRAIC is about to turn and go when suddenly he’s grabbed
one-handed by the hair by PEADAR coming in

PEADAR
Here I’ve a bone to pick with you
dreary Is that little gobshite of mine
at your place again

PADRAIC
He isn’t your little gobshite He’s
everyone’s little gobshite

COLM
Leave him Peadar His donkey’s just died

PEADAR
(smiling)

Did he The little miniature fella

Well Jaysus boys I’1ll tell ya this

Suddenly COLM smashes the smiling PEADAR in the face with a
massive right-handed haymaker PEADAR going down in a heap
the band stopping playing
And PADRAIC blankly looks at PEADAR lying there looks at
COLM equally blankly then moves to the door picks up his
lamp and turns back to COLM

PADRAIC
Two o’clock

He exits

The donkey’s grave in the background PADRAIC feeds and
waters the pony the cows and the calf He gives them loads
and he gives the cows and calf a pat and a kiss goodbye and they
seem to know something is up

Over all this and over the following sections of montage we
hear a letter that SIOBHAN has written or is writing to him

SIOBHAN (V0)
Dear Padraic I am safely ensconced on
the mainland and Padraic it’s lovely
here There’s a river running past my
window as I write and the people
already seem less bitter and mental
I’m not sure why but I think it’s
because a lot of them are from Spain

INT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - DAY 141

PADRAIC and SIOBHAN’s bare room the two lonely single beds

the picture of the Sacred Heart of Jesus between them as
PADRAIC potters OUTSIDE the small window picking up stuff

that we can’t quite see

Mostly I wanted to say there’s a spare
bed here for ya Padraic and with the
war almost over I think there’d be
work for you here

EXT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - DAY 142

PADRAIC has been picking up bits of plywood and driftwood
and anything else that’1ll burn from outside the house and
is loading them onto the pony and cart along with four or five
oil lamps securing all this with rope

SIOBHAN (V0)
Because there’s nothing for you on
Inisherin Nothing but more bleakness
and grudges and loneliness and spite

INT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - DAY 143

In the lonely living room with the two empty chairs the
abandoned books the curtains billowing in the window and the
smashed mirror multiplying everything PADRAIC picks up the
bucket of paraffin from Sc19 and exits with it and thru the
window we see him load it on the cart tie some tarp over it
so it doesn’t spill then slowly ride away towards the bend

SIOBHAN (V0)
-and the slow passing of time until
death And sure you can do that anywhere

EXT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - DAY 144
As PADRAIC rides away cart piled high with inflammables his

animals leave their food and come out onto the road to sadly
watch him go

your animals They could move into the
house together the little goms

EXT LAKE - DAY 145

the wood from the cart stacks it at the door and under the
windows and splashes paraffin over it and up the walls to
the thatched roof

He lights all four oil lamps that are still on the cart then
notices COLM’s dog looking up at him confused

So he lifts the dog onto the back of the cart then takes
the first lit lamp and SMASHES IT at the door which goes up
in flames SMASHES the second under the window and SMASHES
THE REST against the other windows and under the thatch all
of which also go up

The dog is standing staring on the cart now agitated and
confused as the house is engulfed in flames PADRAIC pats
the animals to reassure them and is about to lead the cart
away when

The sound of the clock inside the house CHIMING TWO is
heard

--and PADRAIC stops ponders a moment then goes and looks
in one of the burning windows for the first time

147A

147B

INT COLM’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 147A

With PADRAIC framed in the window COLM raises the lit
cigarette in his hand to his mouth lets out a puff of smoke
then lowers the cigarette again

and PADRAIC nods either to himself or to COLM

EXT COLM’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 147B

then PADRAIC gets on the cart and rides away the dog
still standing on the back of it staring at the burning
house and we ride with PADRAIC a while as THE HOUSE BURNS
BEHIND HIM and we hear PADRAIC’s reply to SIOBHAN

PADRAIC (V0)
Dear Siobhan

EXT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - DUSK 148

Sunset lamp-lit His two cows looking in through the window
at PADRAIC inside

INT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - DUSK 149

In the pretty light of sunset PADRAIC finger-paints
something on a small piece of wood with black shoe polish
which we can’t quite see yet as around him nose his pony
his calf and COLM’s dog

The dog scratches at the door to get back to his own home
but PADRAIC clicks his fingers and it sits back down sadly

PADRAIC (V0)
Obviously I don’t know what ‘ensconced’
is but I thank you for the offer of
the free bed and the whatnot
(pause)
But I won’t be taking you up on it I’m
afraid

EXT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - DUSK 150

PADRAIC hangs the piece of wood onto the donkey’s crucifix
In shoe polish it reads “JENNY” with a little black heart
after it The sun sets on the horizon behind it

PADRAIC (V0)
As I told ya me life is on Inisherin
Me friends me animals

INT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - DUSK 151

PADRAIC sits staring into space lit by a single candle the
life gone from him his animals still milling around the
depressed dog still sitting at the door

PADRAIC (V0)
Even now as I write little donkey
Jenny is looking at me saying please
don’t go Padraic wed miss ya and
nuzzling me the gilly gooly Get off
Jenny

EXT HILL ABOVE COLM’S HOUSE - DUSK 152

With COLM’s burning house an inferno behind him PEADAR
strides away from it taking his handcuffs out

EXT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - DUSK 153

As PEADAR comes to PADRAIC’s he also takes his truncheon out
and is about to head up the path to the candle-lit PADRAIC
inside

MRS MCCORMICK
Whisht

when he’s startled by MRS MCCORMICK who is drenched in
lakewater wet hair matted still carrying her pole She
points and says something to him and PEADAR’s face falls and
he follows her up the lane and away from the house

PADRAIC (V0)
Also in sadder news

EXT LAKE - DUSK 154

DOMINIC’s bloated drowned body lies face up in the shallows
where MRS MCCORMICK is helping drag it with her hook pole as
PEADAR falls to his knees staring at his dead son

PADRAIC (V0)
they found young Dominic’s body in
the lake today he must’ve slipped and
fell in the poor fella So there’d be
no-one to take care of the animals

anyway

EXT COLM’S HOUSE - DUSK 155

at two the fiddle the gramophone the shears the

EXT COLM’S HOUSE - DUSK 155B
And the house TOTALLY COLLAPSES IN ON ITSELF

PADRAIC (V0O)
No other news really

INT PADRAIC’S HOUSE - NIGHT 156

BEDROOM PADRAIC face down on in his lonely bed JENNY’S
ribbon and bell in his hand a single candle lighting the
room looks over at SIOBHAN’s empty bed as the calf the
pony and even the dog look in on him thru the doorway

PADRAIC (V0)
Except that I love you Siobhan and I
miss you and I hope I’1l see you again
some day if ever you come back home

PADRAIC

(in the room quietly)

Come back home Siobhan

PADRAIC (V0)
Yours sincerely your loving brother
Padraic Suilleabhain

He holds his hand over the burning candle a while then
snuffs out the flame with his fingers

FADE TO BLACK

EXT CASTLE RUINS (DUN AENGUS) - DAWN 157

Sunrise over the castle ruins

EXT GRAVEYARD - DAWN 158

Sunrise over the graveyard

EXT HILL ABOVE COLM’S HOUSE - DAWN 159

Sunrise over COLM’s smouldering half-collapsed house as
PADRAIC walks his cows calf and COLM’s dog above the beach
The dog sees something on the beach below then sprints off
happily towards the figure down there staring out to sea

PADRAIC leaves the cows and takes a path down to the beach

EXT BEACH - DAWN 160

The figure is COLM of course and he gives the dog a happy
hug PADRAIC arrives at the water’s edge about fifteen yards
along from them

Up the bank behind them COLM’s BURNED HOUSE STILL SMOULDERS
and a figure appears beside it

EXT COLM’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 161

It’s MRS MCCORMICK pole in hand still wet and bedraggled
the cows idling nearby She stands observing the two men on
the beach (and we might notice here that one of the house’s
windows has been smashed out a chair on the grass outside)

EXT BEACH - CONTINUOUS 162

COLM lets the dog go and looks out to sea the dog slightly
confused between him and PADRAIC

COLM
I suppose me house makes us quits

PADRAIC
If you’d stayed in your house that
would’ve made us quits But you didn’t
did ya so it doesn’t does it

COLM
(pause)
That finger of mine Siobhan brought
back just for the laugh I pinned it
back on with a couple of thumb tacks

COLM reveals his mouldy index finger pinned in place on his
hand - it’s black and rotten and blood seeps painfully from
the tacks where it’s pinned PADRAIC looks at it blankly

then back out to sea

COLM (CONTD)
I only did it for the laugh like It’s
already gone rotten

PADRAIC
(It matches the rest of you so)

COLM
(pause)
I’m sorry about your donkey Padraic
Honestly I am

PADRAIC
If you ate that finger like Jenny a
your finger that’d show you were so

COLM
It wouldn’t show I was sorry It’ds
I was mental

PADRAIC
G’wan Eat it ya lump

COLM unpins his finger painfully then tosses it

te

rry

how

high into

the sea the dog disappointed PADRAIC remains unmoved

COLM
(What’s that thing they say about ve

PADRAIC
(I don’t fucking care you fat ginge
(pause)
Youre just talk)
(pause)
I was nice before all this I don’t
know what I am now

COLM
Youre still nice
(pause)
You’re just dull

PADRAIC
I burned your house down Colm What
else am I supposed to do like

COLM almost smiles They stare out to sea again
quiet mainland across the bay

COLM
I havent heard any rifle-fire from
mainland in a day or two I think
they’re coming to the end of it

PADRAIC nods

PADRAIC
Ah I’m sure they’1ll be starting it
again soon enough aren’t you Some
things there’s no moving on from
(pause)
And I think that’s a good thing

EXT COLM’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Up by the smouldering house MRS MCCORMICK seems

happy at the

way this is playing out She lazily hangs the pole across her

shoulders

PADRAIC

COLM
Padraic

Padraic stops

COLM (CONTD)
Thanks for looking after me dog for me

anyway
PADRAIC looks at the dog for a moment

PADRAIC
Any time

PADRAIC continues away

As COLM looks back out to sea and whistles his tune a few
moments then lets it drift away to nothing

And MRS MCCORMICK pole still across her shoulders watches
it all slightly disappointed

And the distance between the two men gets bigger and bigger
and bigger
