The alarm clock now reads 459 AM It switches to

bed shuts off the buzzer and painfully forces himself
out of bed He hurries out of the bedroom passing the
saddest deadest houseplant in history

Nick opens his fridge to reveal a wasteland of moldy
leftover containers and crusty condiments The orange
juice container he grabs is empty

NICK

boxes of Jimmy Deans Breakfast Bowl -- with Bacon He
pops one in the microwave then glances over at a framed
photo of a slightly younger Nick kissing a smiling OLD
WOMAN on the cheek The frame reads I Y Grandma

The time code at the bottom of the screen reads 602
We see Nick looking up at the camera and silently
mouthing the word Fuck The image freezes and we PULL
BACK to see Harken holding the remote Nick stands
across from him

HARKEN
Heres my concern Nick Youre a
punctual guy You understand the
importance of getting to work on
time So that leaves me to wonder
if there isnt something wrong
with the internal clock in our
security system What do you
think

NICK
I dont know Mr Harken I might
have been a minute late

HARKEN
Two minutes according to this So
either youre a liar -- which I
know youre not -- or our system
is off by a full minute And if
thats the case I have no choice
but to dismiss Thomas our
longtime security coordinator

NICK
Okay I might have been two
minutes late

Theres an uncomfortable beat Then --

HARKEN
So you did lie

NICK
No I --

Harken picks up the phone

NICK
Who are you calling

HARKEN

your drinking problem

NICK
I dont have a --
HARKEN
(with a smile to the
OTHERS)

Lets get started Shall we

Nicks eyes narrow Suddenly he grabs the heavy glass
pitcher from the table and SHATTERS IT AGAINST HARKENS
FACE Shards of glass fly everywhere as Harken falls

from his chair onto the floor

SMASH CUT TO

28 SAME SCENE (REALITY) 28
Harken is fine Nick is as we left him

HARKEN
Okay have we figured out our best
sales distribution plan for the
new model year handsets

28 28

Nicks CO-WORKERS bury their heads in their notes

tensely raises his hand

HARKEN
Yes

NICK
I simulated a number of sales
cycles factoring in likely end-
users point-of-sale limitations
and specific demographic
variables

HARKEN

Nick
And

NICK
And in my opinion an open plan
selling process in our top 30
markets along with targeted
upgrade offers to existing
customers promises the greatest
yield

Harken nods Is he impressed

HARKEN
Thank you Nick Did everyone see
how he did that Yes he may be a
pathological liar and have a
crippling drinking problem but
when the chips are down Nick has
what it takes

Nick glows

HARKEN

Which brings us to our next order
of business Ive decided who I
want as our new Senior VP of
Sales Hes sitting right here
among you

Everyone turns to look at Nick

HARKEN
Its me

Everyones head snaps back to Harken

NICK
What

28 28

HARKEN
Ive decided to absorb the
responsibilities of the Senior VP
position into my own I realized
if you want something done right
you do it yourself So Im going
to be knocking down the wall
between my office and what
wouldve been the Senior VPs to
create a single enormous office
However as a cost-cutting
measure I will only be taking 85
of the additional salary Im
entitled to Its called self-
sacrifice people Learn from
this

Harken heads out

29 INT COMMTRONIX INDUSTRIES - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 29
Nick hurries to catch up with Harken

NICK
Mr Harken can I speak to you

HARKEN
What is it

NICK
Youve been hinting for months
that I was in line for that
promotion

HARKEN
And look how hard youve worked

NICK
So youve just been lying to me

HARKEN
Not lying Motivating Were all
on the same team here Nick
Were all trying to find Lorenzos
oil before its too late for
little Lorenzo Besides Im the
one whos taking on a lot more
work

29 29

NICK
(barely keeping it
TOGETHER)
Last month you kept me working so
late I didnt get to say goodbye
to Gam Gam

HARKEN
What

NICK
My grandmother I told you I
needed to see her but you said Id
be fired if I left early She
died before I could get to the
hospital

(VOICE QUIVERING)
She taught me how to swim --

HARKEN
Oh my God I had no idea that
you called your grandmother Gam
Gam

(CHUCKLING)
I dont mean to laugh but thats
adorable
(off Nicks outraged

LOOK)
Look Nick Im sorry you didnt
get to say bye-bye to Gam Gam I
make you work late because youre
an invaluable part of this
operation And I need you in your
current position

NICK
Ive been in that position for
eight years now Why would I stay
here after being treated like
this

HARKEN
Because I will see to it that no
one else in our industry will hire
you

NICK
What

HARKEN
Anyone who interviews you will
want my letter of recommendation
And Im prepared to tell them that
you are a dishonest insubordinate
drunk
( )

29 29

NICK
But thats not true You cant do
this

intensely

HARKEN
Let me make this clear you weak
little fuck I own you Youre
my bitch Dont make the mistake
of thinking you have free will
Because I can crush you any time I
like
(stepping back

FRIENDLY AGAIN)
Settle in friend Youre here
for the long haul

Harken gets directly in Nicks face

speaking softly but

Harken slaps him hard on the back and continues on his

what Im gonna do So heres the
deal You either fire the fatty
or the cripple or I fire both of

last he gathers his resolve and crosses to Hanks desk
From a RESPECTFUL DISTANCE we watch as Kurt breaks the
news to Hank who reacts with sad resignation

Kurt turns to see Pellit standing directly beside him

PELLIT
(loudly to the room)

natural process

NICK
Shut up Kurt

DALE

KURT

(EARNEST)
Frankly I dont see any reason
not to do it

DALE
Well first of all killing
someone is illegal and immoral --

KURT
It may be illegal but Im not sure
its immoral Sometimes one evil
person has to die for the greater
good of the community If Bobby
Pellit has his way hundreds
maybe thousands of innocent
Bolivians will suffer It would
actually be immoral not to kill
him

Nick begins to warm to the idea

NICK
I didnt get to say goodbye to Gam
Gam because of Harken

KURT
Exactly Who knows how many other
Gam Gams have died alone

DALE
I cant believe you guys are
actually talking about this I
dont care how bad our bosses are
Were not murderers

NICK
No were not Dale Were just
trying to live our lives But
what are we supposed to do when
someone makes it impossible for us
to live our lives Do we just
bend over and take it up the ass
forever

( )

37 37
KURT
No we do not
DALE

What you guys are talking about is
wrong and you know it

NICK
Julias ruining your life Thats

COCKSUCKER JONES
Sorry no refunds

NICK
Thats five thousand dollars You

and let you keep that

COCKSUCKER JONES
(getting in his face)
I think youre forgetting who
youre talking to

Cocksucker pulls back the lower edge of his jacket to
reveal what appears to be the holster of a gun

DALE
Whoa whoa We dont want any
trouble

COCKSUCKER JONES
Now either I give you the advice
you paid for or you can walk away
with nothing Up to you

KURT
Look the whole reason we came to
you is because we dont have the
experience to do it ourselves

COCKSUCKER JONES
Most killers are first-timers
Look the key to a good murder is
making it look like an accident
Gas leak brakes failing suicide
that sort of thing If you do it
right you wont even have to be
there when it goes down

NICK
That makes sense But how would
we fake three accidents

COCKSUCKER JONES
You need to stalk your prey track
their movements get to know them
inside and out Where do they go
What do they eat for breakfast
Whore they fucking

54 54

DALE
Youre talking about surveillance
and recon

COCKSUCKER JONES
But making it look like an
accident wont be enough if the
pigs can pin a motive on you

NICK
Well we all have obvious motives
for killing our bosses

COCKSUCKER JONES
So why dont you kill each others
bosses

DALE
Hey thats a good idea Like
Hitchcocks Strangers on a Train

KURT
The Danny DeVito movie

DALE
Yes the famous Alfred
HitchcockDanny DeVito movie
Youre thinking of Throw Mama from
the Train But its actually the
same idea If we kill each
others bosses theres no link to
us

NICK

COCKSUCKER JONES
Thats what youre paying me for
Now aint that worth five grand

The guys all AD LIB nos

COCKSUCKER JONES

peanuts and Pellit has a huge
stash of cocaine

house and rat poison in Pellits
coke

just got a batch of tainted drugs

DALE
But Harken must always have that
epi-pen on him

They consider this for a beat

KURT
(to the cops)
Let me ask you something
Detective Lets say one of us
knew who the shooter was and was
willing to hand you that perp ona
platter Would he be entitled to
some sort of immunity for that
information

Both Dale and Nick shoot daggers at him

HAGAN
No But he would be entitled to
some sort of jail time Because

if he knew who the shooter was and
didnt tell us that would be
obstruction of justice

A beat

KURT
Well then Im glad we have no
idea who the shooter is right
guys

KURT

NICK

Nick sprints off after his hobbling boss and in SLOW
MOTION violently TACKLES Harken to the pavement Harken
goes down hard his face SLAMMING against the asphalt

As the COPS hurry toward them Nick kneels on the back of
Harkens neck pinning him

HARKEN
Get the fuck off me

Kurt steps up and kneels beside the battered figure

KURT
(GENTLY )
Hey Harken one last thing

HARKEN
(BARKING)

Your wife gives great head

Harken struggles wildly but hes helpless

abdomen

KURT

He falls silent under Margies death stare

MARGIE

(COLDLY)
Kurt I know you were a favorite
of Jacks He was willing to
overlook your inappropriate
behavior with female clients and
service people But you should be
aware Im not Jack And I have
very little tolerance for the
mistreatment of women So
consider this your first strike
KURT
How was I supposed to know you

MARGIE

Kurt opens his mouth to say something but thinks better
of it He stands up and slumps out Life as he knew it
at Pellit Chemicals is clearly over

pants down

JULIA

which are obscured by a tray of tools

JULIA
(in a puppet voice)
“I wish I was Dales weenie so I
could have sex with Julia

Suddenly the patient bursts out LAUGHING and sits up
