DAX
These are todays transaction records

about 400 pages give or take Today
there were over 3000 pages

DEKKER
Meaning

DAX
Weve just witnessed the largest heist
in history Somewhere in the
neighborhood of a billion dollars

DEKKER
Come again

DAX
Its a computer virus The Computer
Virus It randomly withdraws money

from all the accounts and deposits it
into the bad guys account If you
check the transactions no two
withdrawal amounts are the same and
none ofem are over 100 Most
security systems work on the size of
the money not number of transactions
Wire out one million from a handful of
accounts and red flags go up Wire out
a less than a hundred from ten million
accounts no flags

DEKKER
Wheres the money now

DAX
I tried following one of the
transactions It took me an hour and
when I finally had it It went away

How is that possible

Yeah Any deposit or withdrawal from
any bank doesnt usually go into affect
until the next business day So its

going to keep jumping around until it
clears at 9 AM tomorrow

DEKKER

Or 6 AM Pacific time Sunrise So why
break in If theyre just wiring
money Couldnt they do that from
anywhere

DAX
Thats the regional managers computer

access to it There you have unlimited
entry to the banks mainframe No
passwords to work around no hacking
in Its all nice and clean

DEKKER
A billion dollars is missing and were
only discovering this now

DAX
Ironically when the power went out it
helped hide the virus and bought it
time to work
