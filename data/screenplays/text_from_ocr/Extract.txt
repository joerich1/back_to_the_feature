BEGIN CREDITS
EXT REYNOLDS EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY

An idyllic American factory Theres a huge long lawn in
front A Reynolds Extract sign in brick with
flowerslandscaping around it sits near the entrance We
see from the number of cars in the parking lot that its a
company of about 50 - 75 employees

INT REYNOLDS EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY

We are in a manufacturing area of an assembly-line
production Its a big room full of intricate machines huge
vats of different colored extract and other food flavoring
products conveyor belts bottling machines etc It has a
high ceiling with offices on the second floor that have big
windows overlooking this manufacturing area

We PAN up to the main office

INSIDE THE OFFICE

JOEL REYNOLDS head of the company mid-thirties is on the
phone with his friend DEAN

DEAN (vo)

JOEL

JOEL
No This is pretty much normal
these days

As CREDITS continue camera PULLS OUT back down to the
manufacturing area past a big vat of orange extract down
through various stages of assembly line production then
follows several bottles of orange extract moving past
HECTOR a Mexican immigrant employee in his thirties The
camera stops on him Talking to Hector is STEP a short
beady-eyed Charles-Manson-looking guy with a beard and
mustache Step is in his forties He makes everything he
says sound as macho and important as possible

STEP
You get this job through Manpower

HECTOR
Yeah

STEP
I started here with Manpower too
Started out on the line just like

you
(DEAD-SERIOUS)

Only I did better 40 crates a

day

Beat Hector is not quite sure what hes talking about
STEP continues telling his tale in such a way that the only
polite reaction would be one of total amazement
slapping

pack

STEP (CONTD)
Im the best sorter in here
Thats why they made me full time
with benefits Ill probably be
floor manager this year
A FEW FEET AWAY we see RORY a stocky indie-rock geek with
too many tatoos hair shaved on the side with a ponytail
lots of bad piercings wearing baggy shorts with lots of
pockets and some kind of gothy T-shirt -- a look that ought
to be out of style by now

Rory is putting stickers on boxes with a sticker gun He
flips the sticker gun around unnecessarily between each
application adding a few unnecessary movesmotions

each box when hes done generally making the activity look
like more of a skill than it actually is He approaches Step
and Hector pulling out some fliers from his many pockets

RORY
(hands them each a flier)
My bands playing this Friday come
check us out
Hector looks down at the flier Its xeroxed with fifties
clip-art cut out letters and the name of the band Gods
Cock Hector just looks at it confused not knowing much
English not sure what hes supposed to be doing with the
flier
AT THE END OF THE LINE where boxes are loaded onto pallets
sits MARY 58 years old wearing a 15-year-old pair of acid-
wash jeans and an oversized tweety-bird T-shirt fanny

and dayglow yellow triangle-shaped earrings Shes pear-
shaped with short hair Shes bitter and bossy always
shaking her head at everyone She sits on a stool with a
clipboard looks over her glasses at Hector shaking her
head She talks to Gabriella a Hispanic woman in her
forties

MARY
You see that That new guy
Hes holding us up Its not my
job to tell them to hold the line
either

GABRIELLA
And then Joels gonna come yell at
us cuz hes not doing his job

MARY
(folds her arms fed up)
Im just gonna sit here

GABRIELLA
Youre not gonna shut it off

MARY
Im not gonna hold the line If
theyre not gonna do their job why
should I do mine
Mary sits there arms folded lips pursed refusing to pause
the conveyor belt

INT JOELS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Joel is still on the phone with Dean

JOEL
If I dont get home before about
800 she puts on the sweatpants
and once the sweatpants are on

(notices something down

BELOW)
Shit Im gonna have to call you
back
Joel hangs up and runs downstairs

ON THE MANUFACTURING FLOOR
Boxes start to accumulate and fall off the end of the line
Step sees this runs to shut off the line yelling at Mary

STEP
What are you doing
Rory

MARY
What are YOU doing
(pointing at Hector)
What is he doing
A YELLINGBICKERING MATCH breaks out between Mary Step

and Gabriella Joel runs over shuts off the conveyor belt

JOEL (CONTD)
All right Now whats the
problem
They all erupt in more BICKERING AND FINGER POINTING

JOEL (CONTD)
Okay Okay everyone settle down

days maybe his English isnt so
good You gotta be patient

STEP

STEP
(KISS-ASS)

JOEL

Okay now Step Rory Hector lets

fall behind today

Joel walks away People resume their posts Mary starts
right back up with Gabriella
MARY

blame

begrudgingly rolls down the passenger side window so Nathan
can talk to him

NATHAN

sigh of relief Then

ANGLE ON THE GARAGE DOOR

towards the door Nathan leans down into frame as the door
goes down

NATHAN
Oh Joel one more thing--
Joel lets the door shut on him and bolts into the house

INT JOELS HOUSE - EVENING

Joel walks into the living room just as his wife SUZIE
enters from the bedroom pulling on her SWEATPANTS A look of
disappointment on Joels face Suzie is a decent looking
woman about Joels age

JOEL

INT MUSIC STORE - DAY

CINDY a girl in her early twenties is at the counter
looking at a new Gibson hollow-body electric guitar -- one

the really nice ones The price tag says 3950 Shes
beautiful and sexy and all that but theres something
vulnerable and sweet about her as well

Two SALESMEN typical music store employees -- long-haired
goateed nerdy cocky guitar-hacks are giving her way too

attention Its clear that they dont usually have women
this hot in their store They practically stumble over each
other trying to help her

SALESMAN 1
Yeah its expensive but its
sweet Are you familiar with the
Gibson humbucking pickups
CINDY
No sorry I dont play Its for

fiftieth birthday My sisters and
I are all pitching in

SALESMAN 2

An annoyed MALE CUSTOMER has been waiting behind Cindy
trying to get some help but he might as well be invisible
He tries to address Salesman 2 off to the side

MALE CUSTOMER
Excuse me I just have a quick
question

Salesman 2 is oblivious never takes his eyes off Cindy
SALESMAN 2

(OBLIVIOUS)
So what kind of music did he play

BRIAN
Yeah well hes serious now He
just made an offer -- I mean a real
offer this time

JOEL

strategic move because its over
market value I think

JOEL
Wow
Joel lets it sink in He walks over to the window looking
down on the production floor

JOEL
I could unload all this I could
probably retire

BRIAN
I mean yeah theres a lot of
details to work out but this could

DEAN
(shaking his head)
Wow

JOEL
Yeah Im not sure how it

safety record and we comply with
all the safety codes so it was
just a freak accident Therell be
an investigation of some kind Im
sure

DEAN
Well you have insurance for that
kind of thing right

JOEL
Oh yeah Of course In fact
hell probably get a huge
settlement

DEAN
Yeah I would think so I mean
its your balls
Beat as they contemplate the profundity of it

JOEL
Boy it really makes you stop and
think about how fragile we are --
especially our balls Theyre just
hanging there in a little sack
between our legs At any moment
they could be cut off forever

DEAN
Yeah And your balls are really
important man Your balls are
everything What kind of life would
you have with no testicles Can you

PAWN SHOP GUY

BRIAN
Better They say hes going home
in a couple of days Speaking of
which the guys at General Mills
heard about this whole Step thing
Theyre worried If Step decides
to sue us -- beyond the insurance
settlement -- it could be a serious
liability They dont want to make
an offer until this thing has
settled

JOEL
Really They think its that big
of a liability

BRIAN

Well yeah Dont you I mean
think about it Imagine if you
asked a bunch of jurors how much
youd have to pay em to cut their
balls off I mean I wouldnt let
someone cut my balls off fora
billion dollars Seriously --
unless there were some kind of
really expensive operation that
could give you artificial balls or
something Would you

JOEL
No I guess not

BRIAN
Anyway I wouldnt worry He says
hes not going to sue us Says he

(CRUDE IMITATION)
dont want somethin fer nothin
and Whats right is right If we
can just get him to sign something
to that effect we should be fine

JOEL

HuhNow that you mention it you
guys kind of look alike too

JOEL

(GROSSED OUT)
No we dont

DEAN
Okay

JOEL

around and contemplate not getting
laid
Dean nods sympathetically

DEAN

JOEL
Yeah she was really coming on to
me She gave me her phone number

Joel thinks about it

JOEL
No I dont think it would

about all this sexual frustration
without feeling guilty about it

DEAN
Do you think she would cheat on
you

JOEL
Nah

DEAN

JOEL

(CONSIDERS IT)

CINDY
Thats right Step and whats right
is for you to send a message

STEP
A message

CINDY
You need to send a message so that
a horrible accident like this never
happens to anyone else ever again
Thats whats right And the way
you do that is to take them to

court

STEP
You think
CINDY
Yes Step Thats why I calleda
lawyer for you -- that guy on all

the bus stop benches
STEP
Joe Adler

(TOUCHED )
You did that for me

Dean is examining a pill under the cash register light
trying to read the small print He looks concerned

DEAN
Shit Do you remember what color
that pill I gave you was

JOEL
Huh

DEAN
Damn I dont think it was Xanax
I think that mightve been
Ritalin Or Special K

JOEL
(feeling the buzz)
Ah who cares

DEAN
Its just that ah Special K is a
horse tranquilizer kinda has a
weird effect when people take it
but well dont worry about

SPEECH)
You know that thing you were
talking about About the gigolo

DEAN
Yeah

JOEL
Do you think it would be wrong to
do that I mean morally wrong

DEAN
(with full authority)
Oh nooo Definitely not What
could be morally wrong about it

JOEL
I dont know

DEAN
Look if she doesnt want to go for
it she doesnt have to And if
she does then shes the one who
sinned and then its perfectly
morally right for you to go out and
boff whoever you want

wrong about it either

of me -- to ask her to borrow
sunscreen See cuz that way

her if she wanted some too and rub

some on her back instead of just

coming out and asking her to rub

some on her Pretty smooth huh

We see Brad rubbing lotion on Suzies back as she lies face-
down on the chair

BRAD (V0)

Once I was rubbing the sunscreen on

her the rest was easy

Joel pulls up to the house where the party is going on He
stays in the car checking it out

Scanning Joels POV we see the band Godscock playing in
the backyard with Rory on bass They are set up on the
patio of this small two-bedroom suburban house Most of the
people at the party are crowded around the keg which is on
the other side of the backyard ignoring the band The band
sounds awful -- loud as hell unmusical uninspired The
lead singer sings in that awful Eddie Vedder style but even
more loud and overly dramatic Rory acts all intense in
stark contrast to the non-intensity of the music

They all have that baggy-shorts tattooed mid-nineties look
Its downright pathetic

Theres one drunk guy off to the side banging his head
playing air-guitar and stumbling into the bushes

Joel spots Cindy over by the keg drinking mingling He
watches her for a beat then shakes his head and drives

cut To

JOEL

INT WILLIES APARTMENT -- NIGHT

WILLIE loads up some kind of giant three-foot tall bong and
inhales a massive bong-load Hes a burly ex-football player
type who looks like he might have an extra y-chromosome or
two Joel watches Willie feeling a little uneasy Dean
pontificates

DEAN
Ive been reading about it --
theyre making technological
advances now coming up with great
drugs that can make you happy and
wont leave you with a hangover or

nothin

WILLIE
(holding in bong-hit)
Right on

Willie finally exhales The exhale seems to go on way longer
than humanly possible endless amounts of pot-smoke

out (accomplished with special FX) He finally hands the
bong and lighter to Joel

JOEL
Oh I dont know Im kind of a
light weight I think thats too
much for me--

WILLIE
(still holding out the
bong and lighter)
Bullshit

DEAN
Come on Joel Dont worry this
stuff isnt that strong
(to Willie re Joel)

(MORE )

DEAN (CON T-D)

He gets paranoid when he gets too

stoned

Joel looks at Willie then at Dean then takes the bong
partly out of being intimidated by Willie

JOEL
Ah what the hell
Willie instructs Joel on the bong usage in the same
condescending way a weight-lifting instructor would

WILLIE
Okay now this is a gravity bong
Have you ever used one before

JOEL
Umm I think no

WILLIE
Okay pay attention Put your
thumb right here on the carburetor
When I pull the plunger up and say
let go I want you to let go and
inhale hard
Joels POV Looking down the barrel of the three-foot bong
with macho-man Willie holding the lighter at the bowl

WILLIE (CONTD)
Okay exhale

JOEL
You know maybe I should just let

YOU GUYS--

WILLIE
(starting to get scary)
Bullshit EXHALE HARD

Mostly out of fear Joel exhales Willie puts the bong up to
Joels face lights it and starts lifting the plunger Then
pushes it down

WILLIE (CONTD)
Let go Inhale NOW
Joel lets go of the carburator inhales

WILLIE (CONTD)
(INSANE)

GO GO HARDER

Joel inhales with all his might sucking up massive amounts
of thick pot smoke as Willie pushes down the plunger

INT REYNOLDS EXTRACT - CONFRENCE ROOM - DAY

JOE ADLER is holding court with the various lawyers and
paralegals waiting for the meeting to start As promised he
is awful He looks like Henry Winkler with an extra Y
chromosome and a lot of steroids (Maybe cast Gene Simmons
with his hair pulled back in a pony tail)

ADLER
-You see if both his balls had
been knocked clean off he would be
a good case but not a great case
A man with no balls is no man at
all Hes a freak Hes barely
human Hes gross And a jury will
never feel like they can walk in
the shoes of a ball-less neutered
heshe freak But Step Hes

still got one ball - barely Hes
still a man A man whos very
manhood has been jeopardized but
still a man And that manhood

that very sense of what you are as
a human being is hanging by a
thread Jesus you cant get more
dramatic than that That brave
ball hanging on for dear life
hanging on for justice is going to
be the hero of this trial Im
tellin ya this Step guy is the
fuckin Holy Grail the Powerball
Jackpot And you all laughed at me
when I bought those bus bench ads

GABRIELLE
Thats right Here hes gonna make
a million dollars and were the
ones who do everything I went to

MARY
If we quit this place couldnt
run They wouldnt be able to sell
this place for anything
JIM a tall skinny 50-something guy with a ridiculously big
mustache and a little paunch chimes in

JIM
Thats why what we should do is is
we should all go on strike --
demand stock in the company before
it sells If General Mills knew
we were on strike they wouldnt
buy this place until the strike was
over That way theyd have to give
us stock
Jim points to his head gives everyone a hows that nod
It starts to build steam

RORY
Thats right man We should do it
We should strike

MARY
Thats right I could get a job at
Gemco like that At Gemco all the
employees are owners -- even says
so on the name tags

GABRIELLE
Mmm hmm I could get a job at
Southwest Airlines

INT REYNOLDS EXTRACT - CONFRENCE ROOM - DAY

one lawyer who doesnt say much

Everybody has in front of them a small stack of documents

ADLER

JOEL

(so pissed he can barely

get the words out)

JOEL

Joel is stunned by
BRIAN
This is what Ive been trying to
tell you Joel

JOEL
If you think Im just going to give
up this entire company that I built
from the ground up--
Adler jumps up dripping with phoney forced indignation

ADLER
How about what my client gave up
His testicles How about that
He walks over to the door

ADLER
In fact Ill make a deal with you -
- we will drop this case right now
if you come over here and put your

(indicates the space
between the door and the

HINGES)
and let me slam this door like

Adler SLAMS the door ridiculously hard

ADLER
Go ahead We can settle this right
now -- call it even I will drop

this case right now if you let me

The employees all nod in agreement

Employees POV Adler pointing at his balls pointing to the
door again about to slam it One of his lawyers stops him

RORY
We gotta act fast They could be
about to close the deal

JIM
Yeah and leave us out in the cold

RORY
Yeah then its too late If
theyve already sold it we cant
get a piece of it We gotta act
fast We need to do one of those
walk outs
JIM
Well we better do it now

RORY
Okay whos in We need a show of
force Come on its now or
never
We PAN around the employees as the idea builds momentum
ending on HECTOR who looks completely confused by it all

INT REYNOLDS EXTRACT - CONFRENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The meeting heats up

ADLER
Okay then let me go back to my
previous offer I will gladly come
down on that price -- Ill come all
the way down to zero and drop this
case -- if you go over there right

door Because--

JOEL
I dont wanna slam my testicles in

reasonable You wont even budge
one penny Come on

ADLER
Like I say if you slam your--

JOEL

and mutter things like go ahead you first Finally

RORY
Umm We were just uh
JIM

Well Rory was talking about how
you guys are doing this deal with
General Mills and we just think
that ah We were considering the

cuz we do all the work And if we
dont um
Joels in no mood for this He goes off on them

JOEL
You know what Fine Fine
Youre all in charge -- all of you

(gestures to all the
first

EMPLOYEES)
As of now You run the goddamn
place Go ahead In fact you can
go up there right now and meet with
Adler He may slam your balls in

boss
Joel storms out leaving the employees standing there
A BICKERING MATCH erupts over who was supposed to do the
talking who said they would say what who backed down

etc I was gonna say something but you interrupted You
didnt say anything when he was leaving so I thought you

were quitting I wouldve stood up to him

As the argument dies down one by one they all go back to

their posts muttering

INT JOELS HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Joel is sitting at the table picking at some food looking
miserable Suzie comes over gathers up her nerve

SUZIE
Listen Joel theres something I
have to tell you I think we need
to be honest with each other
Suzie sits down

SUZIE (CONTD)
Im not sure how to say this but --
well youve been so caught up in
youre work lately and Im here
alone all day and sometimes I just--

JOEL
You banged the pool cleaner

SUZIE
Wha

Suzie is stunned

JOEL
Thats what youre trying to tell
me right You had sex with Brad

SUZIE
You knew

JOEL
Yes I knew I hired him

SUZIE
Well I know you hired him but how
did you know about--

JOEL
I dont mean I hired him to clean
the pool I mean I hired him to
have sex with you

SUZIE
What

JOEL
Hes a gigolo Suzie
Suzie is stupefied

SUZIE
But what Why
Joel is so fed up he just tells her everything

JOEL
I hired him to have an affair with
you so that I could have an affair
without feeling guilty I was
really drunk and on some kind of
horse tranquilizer and--

SUZIE
Brad was getting paid
(disbelief hurt)
So youve been paying Brad this
whole time All fifteen times
JOEL
FIFTEEN TIMES Jesus Christ
Suzie
Joel sinks into his chair shaking his head

JOEL (CONTD)
I only paid him once -- well
twice The rest was on the house
Long beat as Suzie tries to let it all sink in

SUZIE
You wanted to have an affair with
another woman

JOEL
Yes But I didnt
Suzie paces around for a moment reeling processing all
this Then decisively

SUZIE
You asshole

JOEL
Oh Im the asshole

SUZIE
Yes How could you

JOEL

(LAUGHS)

How could I How could you

You didnt have to have sex with
him You couldve simply said No
thanks Just clean the pool but
you didnt did you No you took
him up on his little offer and had
sex with him -- fifteen times

SUZIE

None of this wouldve happened if
you hadnt hired him

JOEL
Okay Ill admit I made a big
mistake I was drunk on drugs
stressed sexually frustrated and I
shouldnt have hired a male
prostitute to seduce you But if
you had simply been faithful none
of this wouldve happened
Suzie just looks at him for a beat

SUZIE
Youre sick you know that
Beat Joel cant really argue this point

JOEL
What do you see in Brad anyway
Hes borderline retarded You
probably couldve been arrested for
having sex with a guy that dumb

SUZIE
Thats it Im leaving
Suzie heads for the door Joel follows after her

JOEL

EXT EXTENDED STAY AMERICA SUITES -- NIGHT

Joel pulls into the parking lot He looks surprised seeing
something on the other side of the lot that gets his
attention

JOEL

(TO HIMSELF)
No way
From JOELS POV we see Cindy pull up and get out of her

Joel watches as she gets out with a grocery bag and heads up
the stairs Joel gets out and watches her from a distance
He sees her go into a room and shut the door

He stares up at the door for a beat Then with a look of
determination Joel walks up the stairs and knocks on her
door

INT CINDYS ROOM -- CONTINUOUS ACTION

Cindy opens the door a little startled to see Joel but
pleasant to him

CINDY
Oh Joel I ah

JOEL

CINDY
Whatre you Whats up Howd
you know I was here

JOEL
Ah actually Im staying here too
Down on the first floor around the
back I thought I saw you so I
ah

CINDY
Well come in
Joel enters stands in the living room Cindy heads in to
the kitchen

CINDY (0S)

Do you want something to drink I

think all I have is Diet Coke

Joel notices MARYS PURSE lying on the coffee table He
stares at it

JOEL
No thanks
Cindy comes back in with a Diet Coke

CINDY
Have a seat
Joel remains standing looking at the purse

JOEL

Thats Marys purse Isnt it
CINDY

What
JOEL

Right there Thats Marys purse

CINDY
Oh that No thats mine So
how are things at work

JOEL
Thats Marys purse You stole it
didnt you

Cindy acts like hes being silly Theres nothing about her
demeanor that would make anybody think shes lying

CINDY
No It probably just looks like
it Theres a lot of those

JOEL
Ive never seen another one You
probably have Sylvias wallet in
here somewhere too dont you And
everything else thats been stolen
from my employees

CINDY
Joel are you okay

JOEL
No Im not Thats Marys purse
Goddammit Okay Everyone blamed
Hector He almost got fired
Doesnt that bother you

CINDY
(innocent sweet)
Joel I dont know what youre--

JOEL
Hector Hard working guy never
did anything wrong And what are
you doing with Step Youre trying
to screw him out of his settlement
money arent you

CINDY
I have no idea what youre talking
about

JOEL

Yes you do Youre the only reason
hes suing us arent you You know
how much work it took for me to
build up that company You just
dont care about anybody do you
What are you some kind of
sociopath
Cindy looks like Joel might be getting to her

JOEL (CONTD)
You cant even admit that you stole
this purse can you You just cant
do it

(MORE )

JOEL (CONTD)
In fact you probably cant tell
the truth about much of anything
can you
Cindy turns away from him looking down at the floor

JOEL
I bet Cindys not even your real
name is it Who are you Where
the hell are you from
Cindy still looking away doesnt answer

JOEL (CONTD)
You cant answer can you Because
if you said one true thing youd
have to tell the truth about
something else and then it would
all unravel wouldnt it Then
youd have to admit that you stole
this purse and God knows what else
Beat Cindy still looking away down at the floor We see
her eyes well up about to cry but Joel doesnt notice

JOEL

(COMPOSES HIMSELF)
Well Im leaving now
Joel picks up the purse

JOEL
And Im taking this purse with me
If it really is yours you can call
the police and tell em I stole
it In fact Im gonna call the
police and report it

Joel walks towards the door Then Cindy slumps down on the
couch mutters something still looking down at the floor

her voice cracking slightly

CINDY
Please dont
Joel stops

JOEL
What

CINDY

(still looking down)

Please dont report it to the
police Im on probation Ill go
to jail For a long time

JOEL

Well Maybe you shouldve thought
about that before you started
ripping off my employees

Joel starts to open the door

CINDY

Joel Please Ill leave Step
alone I promise Hell drop the
lawsuit

Joel considers this

JOEL
How do I know that

CINDY
You can keep the purse If I dont
leave him alone if he doesnt drop
the lawsuit then you can report

Beat
JOEL
Hmm I guess that ah Do you

watch Can I get those too
Beat Cindy nods still looking down Joel considers it

JOEL
Well Okay then I guess that
works

(REALIZING)

And I guess you just admitted that

you stole the purse Thats good

I guess A step in the right

direction

Joel sits down on the couch also With her head still down
Cindy is weeping quietly Joel doesnt notice looking
straight ahead

JOEL
So whats your deal anyway I
mean how did you end up like this
Joel finally looks over notices that shes crying Hes
caught off guard

JOEL
-Ah Cindy
Cindy breaks down and starts bawling

JOEL (CONTD)
Okay now you see thats what
Im talking about Youre trying
to manipulate me now and Im not
gonna fall for it
Cindy starts bawling even harder

JOEL (CONTD)
I really hope youre not faking
this right now because Im feeling
really bad Are you faking it
Cindy shakes her head no
or

him

JOEL
Im sorry I was just curious you
know how a person ends up like
this
Cindy suddenly starts BAWLING hysterically
Joel stands there awkwardly not sure if he should hug her

comfort her in any way

JOEL
Never mind Im sorry
Joel tentatively puts a comforting arm around her and she
leans in to him crying on his chest
He puts his other arm around her and she snuggles in even
closer As her crying gradually subsides she snuggles in
even more Finally she lifts her head and they start
kissing As they get hot and heavy we

We PULL OUT to reveal that hes alone in Cindys bed He
sits up yawns He has a big satisfied smile on his face

JOEL
Cindy
He looks around realizes hes alone Then suddenly looks
worried

JOEL (CONTD)
Oh shit
He scrambles for his pants then looks relieved as he
realizes his wallet is still there He sets down the pants
then after a beat picks them up again checks inside the
wallet and sees theres still cash and credit cards Then he
looks up at the chest of drawers and sees Marys purse
Sylvias wallet and a watch placed side by side
He lies back in bed and shuts his eyes grinning again

Joel walks in bright-eyed and cheery greeting people He
walks over to Mary carrying her PURSE

JOEL

Joel hands her the purse Mary looks at it not quite sure
how to react not ever wanting to appear grateful for
anything -- not in her nature

JOEL (CONTD)

Joel walks off Mary just shakes her head at him She
whispers to Gabriella

STEP
Look ah Cindy left me
Joels nods not surprised but sympathetic
JOEL
Wow Bummer

Yeah he sure is

STEP
The truth is I just want to have
my old life back -- I just want to
go back to work Im a workin

JOEL
Yeah Im beginning to think I
might be the same way Ima

little worried about what Id do
with too much time on my hands

STEP
I just lay around and watch TV all
day

JOEL
Yeah I think I do a lot worse

STEP

The problem is if I bankrupt the
company there wont be a job to go
back to

JOEL
You dont have to bankrupt the
company

STEP
Yeah but then if I drop the
lawsuit youll sell the company
and the new company might not hire
me

JOEL
Well maybe I dont have to sell
the company You know Ive been

thinking all these years Ive been

building this company dreaming

about the day I could sell it and

retire but what would I really do

if I retired Its like that old

saying -- its not about the

destination its about the

journey

Step just stares at him blankly he lost him

JOEL
I guess what Im saying is too
much free time might not be such a

good thing -- like that old saying
idle hands are the Devils
playground

Steps never heard that one either

STEP
Im sorry I dont do much book
readin

JOEL

What Im saying is Im thinking
maybe I wont sell the company

STEP
Really

JOEL
that is if you dropped the
lawsuit -- and remember youll

still get that insurance money --
probably a couple hundred thousand
What do you think

STEP
Hmm That sounds fair But
under one condition

JOEL
Whats that

STEP
You make me floor manager

JOEL

JOEL
Maybe we shouldve been married in
a Church like that one Instead of

Gardens

You think it wouldve made a
difference
