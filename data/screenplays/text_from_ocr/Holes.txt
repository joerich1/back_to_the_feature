FADE IN

EXT TEXAS DESERT -- HELICOPTER SHOT -- SUNRISE
We glide across the VAST TEXAS DESERT flowing into the
PURPLE SKY like a conveyor belt of GOLDEN SAND PAPER
NARRATOR
(elderly voice)
Once when it was still early in the
twenty-first century there existed

a prison in a sea of sand All signs
of life in this place had been
destroyed by something terrible and
that something had dried up into the
earth and the earth was a prison
for all mankind

We approach a desolate road stretching off into the
horizon as a LONE SCHOOLBUS drives along leaving a
thundering blaze of DUST behind it

We approach the SCHOOLBUS where a LONE FIGURE can he
seen through a dirty glass window

NARRATOR (cont’d)
There was oung man named Stanley
Kramer Héacommitted a crime and he
was sent out into the depths of
nowhere to be punished

INT SCHOOLBUS -- NEXT

Sitting HANDCUFFED in the MIDDLE SECTION of the Schoolbus
is STANLEY KRAMER (age 16) a handsome young man with
blue eyes and blonde hair

He looks out the window his head almost resting
against the glass

NARRATOR
He did not feel sorry for what he had
done but feeling sorrow is not

adequate punishment for such a crime
Feeling sorrow does not absolve the
crime from the memory of the
victims if the victims are still
breathing

Stanley looks forward to the GUARD driving the bus as
it begins to slow down

GUARD
(yelling over the engine)
You awake Kramer
STANLEY
Yes sir

GUARD
Welcome to Camp Green Lake

EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE -—- NEXT

The Schoolbus turns underneath an ANCIENT ARC SHAPED
SIGNPOST that reads WELCOME TO CAMP GREEN LAKE

The sign is brand new

The Schoolbus follows the dirt road out towards a CLUSTER
OF BUILDINGS in the distance

NARRATOR
When it was all said and done
people said that it was fate that sent
him to the prison Others said that it
was mere coincidence one of many
coincidences that form the rhythm
guiding the children out into the
unknown

The Schoolbus pulls up in front of the MAIN BUILDING

The engine cuts off with a shudder and the guard leads
Stanley out of the BUS taking him inside
INT CAMP GREEN LAKE -- MAIN BUILDING -- NEXT

warts
While Stanley stands quietly against the wall the GUARD
signs several forms at a desk behind which sits MISTER

SIR (age 40) He has his feet up on the desk casually
chewing on SUNFLOWER SEEDS

The guard unlocks Stanley’s HANDCUFFS from his wrists and
feet

GUARD
Five hours here Five hours back
(sighs)
What a day

The guard heads out the door in a huff

Mr Sir spits out a mouthful of sunflower seeds into the
trash can and then approaches Stanley

MR SIR
Stanley Kramer My name is Mr Sir
(beat)
Whenever you speak to me you must call
me by my name is that clear
STANLEY
Yes Mister Sir

MR SIR
You answer to me now

INT MAIN BUILDING SUPPLY ROOM -- NEXT
Stanley is now dressed in a longsleeve BLUE JUMPSUIT

MR SIR
You get three jumpsuits Wash is every
two weeks Unfortunately for you
we’re out of sunscreen Supply truck
doesn’t come for two weeks But by
then your skin will be nice and
leathery

Mr Sir hands Stanley a shiny FIVE FOOT METAL SHOVEL

MR SIR (cont’d)
You are to dig one hole each day
except Sundays Bach hole must be
exactly five feet deep and five feet
actoss in every direction Your shovel
is your measuring stick Breakfast is
served at 430

Mr Sir turns toward the doorway

MR SIR (cont’d)
No one is going to baby-sit you The
longer it takes to dig the longer you
will be out in the sun If you dig up
anything interesting anything at
all you are to report it to me or
any other counselor When you finish
the rest of the day is yours

EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE -- NEXT we
h4

Stanley and Mr Sir step out of theair-conditioned
building into the blazing heat LARGE TENTS are
assembled several hundred yards to the east

Stanley can see dozens of other prisoners milling about
in their jumpsuits past the tents

MR SIR
Take a good look around you
(beat)
What do you see

Stanley gazes across the expanse of DRY EARTH
STANLEY
Not much

Mr Sir feigns a laugh

MP SIR

You see any guard towers
STANLEY

No
MR SIR

How about an electric fence
STANLEY

No
MR SIR

There’s no fence at all is there
STANLEY

No
MR SIR

You want to run away

Stanley looks at him for a moment unsure of how to
respond

MR SIR (cont’d)
If you want to run away go ahead
start running I’m not going to stop
you

Mr Sir smiles at him revealing crooked yellow teeth

MR SIR (cont’d)
I see you’re looking at my gun Don’t
worry I’m not going to shoot you
(he taps his holster)
This is for yellow spotted lizards I
wouldn’t waste a bullet on you

STANLEY
I’m not going to run away

MR SIR
Good thinking Nobody runs away from
here We don’t need a fence Know why
Because we’ve got the only water for a
hundred miles You want to run away
You’1ll be buzzard food in three days

Stanley stares at him silently showing no emotion
MR SIR (cont’d)
When the buzzards start gnawing at
your flesh most likely youll
still be alive
(leaning in)
So go ahead and run ‘cause I don’t
ever waste a bullet

Stanley does not flinch

STANLEY
Mister Sir isn’t every bullet a
wasted bullet

Surprised at Stanley’s aggressive demeanor Mr Sir
raises his gun to Stanley’s face

MR SIR
Not if I hit the target right between
the eyes
STANLEY
But isn’t that an even greater waste
(beat)

The waste of a living thing I mean
Mr Sir does not follow

STANLEY (cont’d)
I think that it is a far greater

waste when a bullet tears through
flesh destroying what God has
built

(beat)

Cutting life short
Mister Sir’s smile disappears

STANLEY (cont’d)
If anything when a bullet misses
its target well I consider that
to be a miracle from God

Mr Sir appraises Stanley for a long moment He then
takes out his CANTEEN and takes a long sloppy drink in
front of Stanley in the searing heat of the midday sun

MR SIR
You thirsty Stanley

STANLEY
Yes Mister Sir

Mp Sic seas he cap ow the can teor MAUL pod esiosmeps
EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE -- HELICOPTER SHOT -- NEXT

We see FROM AN AERIAL VIEW the entire expanse of TENTS
lined up on the edge of the camp

NARRATOR
There were six tents at Camp Green
Lake Letters A through F The first
five tents were for the campers
assigned by age group The counselors
slept in TENT F Stanley was assigned
to TENTP Pendanski was his
counselor

EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE -- TENT D -—- NEXT

Stanley stands with his shovel across from PENDANSKI (age
35) He is a tall more white collar—-looking man than Mr
Sir

PENDANSKI
My name is really easy to remember
Three easy words pen dance key

STANLEY
Or two words PENANCE and DYKE
(beat)
If you re-arrange the letters a
little

Pendanski smirks at this

Mr Six drives by in a RED DODGE PICKUP TRUCK with a
specially mounted REAR CAB holding several campers He
glares at Stanley

PENDANSKI
Don’t mind him He’s just been ina
bad mood ever since he quit smoking
The person you really have to worry
about is the Warden There’s really
only one rule at Camp Green Lake
Don’t upset the Warden

Stanley and Pendanski walk out toward the vast lakebed
Stanley can see dozens of other CAMPERS out digging

PENDANSKI (cont’d)
I want you to know Stanley that I
respect you I understand you’ve made
some bad mistakes in your life
Otherwise you wouldn’t be here But
everyone makes mistakes You may have
done some bad things but that doesn’t
mean you’re a bad kid
They come to a stop in an area closer to the other
Campers already digging

PENDANSKI (cont‘’d)
Im going to help you turn your life
around Stanley But youre going to
have to help Can I count on your
help

STANLEY
Yes six

PENDANSKI
Good Now this is a good place to
start You know the rules
(beat)
Do you like to dig Stanley

Stanley looks at him silently for a moment

STANLEY
Sure

PENDANSEI
Digging a hole is a healthy
therapeutic exercise

(beat)
Do you know what THERAPEUTIC means
Stanley
STANLEY
Sure
PENDANSKI
What do you think it means
STANLEY
I guess you could say it’s like
therapy that makes you want to

puke
(beat)
That’s what therapeutic means to me

Pendanski is once again taken aback by Stanley He almost
smiles at this

PENDANSKEI
Okay then Lets get started

Pendanski begins to walk away

STANLEY
Pendanski

He turns around in his tracks
PENDANSKI
Yes Stanley

STANLEY

You don’t have to be nice to me just
because all of the other ounselors
are assholes

(beat)
There’s nothing you can do to help me
There’s nothing you can say that will
make me believe that I am going to
enjoy this experience

(beat)
I know that the next eighteen months
are going to be hell Probably the
worst year and a half of my life

Pendanski nods his head slowly

STANLEY (cont’d)
So I only want you to be nice to me if
you’re ina good mood If you’re in a
bad mood feel free to act like an
asshole Because there’s not ing more
depressing than someone who s’jonly
pretending to be your friend

Pendanski’s smile slowly returns

PENDANSKI
Here’s some advice from a friend
Stanley
(beat)
Shut your mouth and start digging

And then he is gone

And Stanley turns his eyes toward the cracked and
scorched ground beneath his feet

He then takes his SHOVEL and tries to jam it into the
ground The eracked sand is so hard that the shovel

merely bounces off

Stanley tries again but the shovel won’t budge By the
third try- he makes it through

MONTAGE

Stanley marks the FIVE FOOT SQUARE OUTLINE begins to

dig in the center until the hole is about 35 finished

He stops to take 4 break and notices another YOUNG MAN
approaching him It is X-RAY (age 15)
X-RAY
Hey

STANLEY
Hey

X-RAY
What’s your name

STANLEY
Stanley

X-RAY
Call me X-Ray
(beat)
I’ve got X-Ray vision you see fT
can see through space and time

STANLEY
(long beat)
Wow

X-RAY

Don’t worry give you a couple a
weeks you’ll have a stupid nickname
too

(beat)
You kmow you’re doing it all wrong
You gotta start your dirt pile further
out Remember it’s all about
compression

STANLEY
Compression
X-RAY
The dirt You see it’s all compressed
But when you dig it up it gets all
loose takes up three times more
space
(pointing over to another
digger)
You see

We see further down a young man named ZERO (age 16)

He is almost finished with his hole

VERY LARGE

X-RAY (contd)

and his pile is

That’s Zero He don’t talk much but
that boy can dig like a sumbitch He
can dig faster than anybody at Camp

Green Lake

STANLEY
How long’s he been here

X-RAY
About a year People say he dug the
very first hole Right after the war

ended

(beat)
He don’t talk about it and nobody
knows for sure but people say he

killed someone

Stanley stares over at Zero silently They make eye
contact and Stanley turns away

X-RAY (cont’d)
So what’d you do You steal
somethin’

STANLEY
(beat)
I don’t want to talk about it

X-RAY
I understand You probably did
somethin’ stupid to get here just like
me

They are silent for a moment

X-RAY (cont’d)

Well aren’t you gonna ask me what I
did
STANLEY
What’d you do
X-RAY
Me and my friend Darryl we stole a

Slurpee machine from 7-11 Then we
threw it off the roof of our school

STANLEY
Roof testing stuff is cool but why
a Slurpee machine

X-RAY
Cuz when it smashes all the Slurpee
splatter like a sumbitch It looked
badass But this lunchlady saw us do
it Stupid bitch

STANLEY
That sucks
X-RAY
Yeah but I think it was worth it

(beat)
X-RAY (cont’d)
Well I gotta get back to diggin’
before the Warden comes by

STANLEY
The Warden

X-RAY
Yeah You’11 know when you see hin
(serious beat)
Whatever you do don’t ever let the
Warden see you slackin’ off Ever

STANLEY
Thanks for the warning

And then X-Ray is gone

Stanley begins to dig once again Suddenly a voice
Galls out from behind

VOICE
Hey Rookie

THEO (age 16) approaches

THEO

STANLEY
Naw They were all out
Theo pulls out a bottle of sunscreen and throws it to
Stanley
THEO

me here

(beat)
And here I found God

me focus It makes me stronger

(beat)
The Warden taught me this

STANLEY

THEO
(smiles)
Soon enough No one meets the Warden

on their first day

STANLEY
Is the first day the hardest Theo

THEO
No People say that the second day is

STANLEY
Why the second day

2
THEO
Because that’s when you meet the
Warden
Stanley is silent fora moment nodding his head

THEO (cont’d)
Good luck Stanley

Theo runs off toward his hole in a military-like trot

Stanley then applies some SUNSCREEN and begins to dig
once again

MONTAGE

Stanley has now dug out almost 75 of his HOLE He
stops looking down at his hands They have begun to

BLISTER

Suddenly another voice can be heard from behind him
VOICE
Hey you smoke rookie boy
STANLEY

(turning around)
Naw I don’t smoke

ALAN (age 17) approaches He puts 4 cigarette in his
mouth and lights it

ALAN
Give yourself a week You’ll be
smokin’ s Just don’t let the warden see
you And bury your butts in the dirt
(motioning toward Theo)
Theo give you some sunblock

STANLEY
Yeah

ALAN
(laughing)
Good ‘ol Theo That boy actually likes
this shithole You believe that

STANLEY
I don’t know too much about this

STANLEY

ALAN

My sister got food poisoning from Jack
in the Box

ALAN

STANLEY

Alan laughs out loud

ALAN

(turning back to his hole)

Hey whatever you do don’t ever
use no foul language in front of the
Warden Not even DAMN and never

HELL You understand

STANLEY
Damn straight

14
a Se

ALAN
(smiling)
See you in hell Stanley

And then Alan is gone
Stanley then turns around and tries to finish his hole
He looks over and sees that ZERO has now completed his

hole and is sitting INDIAN STYLE on the ground next to
it staring out at the LATE AFTERNOON HORIZON

MONTAGE

The sun is going down in a wake of PURPLE SKY

Stanley finishes his hole just as the SUN IS BEGINNING
TO SET He takes his SHOVEL and places it against the
vertical wall of the hole measuring out FIVE FEET

From above the RUMBLING of an ENGINE can be heard

Stanley awkwardly climbs out of his hole trying to get
his footing on the walls He eventually climbs out
covered in sweat and dirt his hands blistered He
looks EXHAUSTED

It is a DODGE PICKUP TRUCK and Mr Sir is driving In
the back of the cab are several campers including
X-Ray Theo and Alan

Mr Sir turns off the engine and steps out of the cab

MR SIP

You finished yet Stanley
STANLEY

Yes sir
MR SIR

You sure

STANLEY
Yes siz

Mr Sir is carrying a DIGITAL CLIPBOARD It is dusty and
battered but still functional On the DIGITAL
CLIPBOARD Mr Sir touches a PLASTIC PENCIL to the
screen

The CLIPBOARD SCREEN shows an OVERHEAD MAP of CAMP GREEN
LAKE Mr Six touches the pencil to the screen zooming
in on an area SOUTHWEST of the main camp On the
COORDINATE MAP there are several dozen SQUARES marking
other holes that have been completed with the DATE
DIGGER and GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATES

MR SIR
Stanley Kramer Your registration code
ts SOd0

In free-hand Mr Sir draws out S0OL and the scribbles
are translated into TEXT with Stanley’s INFORMATION
and PHOTOGRAPH on the SCREEN

MR SIR (cont’d)
Mark your hole Stanley

STANLEY
Excuse me

MR SIR
I said mark your hole If you
acknowledge completion of your hole
you scratch your registration code in
the dirt next to it And then 1

Stanley then scratches into the dirt next to his hole
SOL 1

Mr Sit then approaches quickly

MR SIR (cont’d)
Give me your shovel

Stanley hands him his shovel

Mr Sir takes it and then hops down into Stanley’s hole
with the precision of a man who has done this many times

He then takes the shovel holding it vertically and
begins to examine the walls of Stanley’s hole

Stanley looks at Mr Sir nervously and then gazes over
at the others staring at him from the back of the cab
They are mostly silent but a few people have DEVIOUS
SMIRES on their faces

Mr Sir then places the SHOVEL on one part of the wall
and the HANDLE to the shovel BARELY RISES ABOVE the edge

of the hole

MR SIR (cont’d)
This isn’t five feet

Mr Sir then climbs out of the hole handing Stanley
back his shovel

MR SIR (cont’d)
This hole is not finished
(beat)
Start over

Stanley stares at the hole unsure of what to do
STANLEY
Six you want me to start over
MR SIR

Yes This incomplete hole is already

marked Start digging another one now
(pointing west)

Over there

Mr Sir then walks back to the truck

MR SIR (cont’d)
I’d get started quick
(beat)
Tt will be dark soon

Then Mr Sir starts the engine and drives off as the
others STARE BACK AT HIM FROM THE CAB

Stanley is left alone standing next to his INCOMPLETE
HOLE He looks up at the DARKENED PURPLE SKY

He looks down at his BLISTERED HANDS and then picks up
his shovel walking several yards west and begins to
dig once again

MONTAGE
As the sun goes down Stanley digs alone
For the first time we pull back from above Stanley

into a HELICOPTER SHOT AT SUNSET revealing HUNDREDS OF
HOLES THAT COVER THE DESERT FLOOR around the camp

For the first time we see the ASTONISHING VOLUME OF WORK
that has transpired to create this SURREAL LANDSCAPE

The helicopter shot moves over the CAMP BUILDINGS as the
WORLD HAS GROWN COMPLETELY DAPRE

We move in toward TENT D

INT TENT D -- NEXT

We see inside the LARGE TENT that there are TWO ROWS OF
BEDS with A DOZEN SLEEPING YOUNG MEN on either side

Wk Pendans ki lets Stanley into the tent

PENDANSKI
(wiping sleep from his eyes)
I suggest you get to sleep as fast as
you can Stanley the sun comes up in
about two hours
28 3
PENDANSKI (cont’d)
(pointing)
That’s your bunk down at the end

Stanley hobbles his weary body down toward the bunk
hearing the snores of the other prisoners

He falls to the bed asleep within seconds

FADE TO BLACK

INT TENT D -- EARLY THE NEXT MORNING
A HARSH WHISTLE SOUND breaks through the silence

STANLEY jolts awake

Mr Six and Pendanski are walking through the tent
blowing their whistles

Stanley looks over and sees that ZERO has the bunk to his
left THEO has the bunk to his right They are quickly
putting on their JUMPSUITS

THEO
I’‘d hurry Stanley A let of times the
breakfast runs out quick

INT MESS HALL -- NEXT

All WINETY-SIX campers are packed into the mess hall
There is only a small amount of groggy early morning
conversation

INT MESS HALL SERVING LINE -- NEXT
Stanley is in line with X-Ray Theo and Zero

DEREK one of the two COOKS at Camp Green Lake is
standing behind the counter

X-RAY
Hey Derek what is this horseshit

DERER
You don’t wanna know kid Just eat it
and hope it don’t give you Cancer

X-RAY
Would you eat this shit Derek

DEREF
Not a chance

THEO
What do you eat Derek
DEREE
Pussy

X-RAY
Derek we both know there ain’t no
pussy on Camp Green Lake

DEREER
Sure there is I’m lookin’ at one
right now

GROUP
Raaaaaaaawww

The group continues to taunt X-Ray
INT MESS HALL -- NEXT

Stanley is sitting with X-Ray Theo Alan and Zero at a
table scarfing down WRETCHED FOOD They are joined by
DARRYL (age 16) and ANTHONY (black age 17)

ALAN
So Stanley how was it last night
You have to dig two holes

Alan shifts his eyes to the others with a knowing look

STANLEY
Yeah I coulda sworn I measured it
right but then

X-RAY
Don’t worry You measured right

DARRYL
Tt’s a trick Stanley They always
make you dig two holes on the first

night

ANTHONY
They might even do it again later
on just to keep you from ever

slackin’ off

THEO
It makes the rest of the days easier
Stanley Now when you finish each day
youll only be using half of your
energy One is a piece of cake

Stanley thinks for a moment

STANLEY
What are we digging for

LS
The whole table is silent Anthony and X-Ray look down at
their food Alan eyes Theo Zero almost smiles

THEO
We’re not supposed to talk about that

Stanley

(beat)
The Warden forbids that Just keep
digging and then you will discover
the truth buried inside of you

The table is quiet for a moment Alan pulls out a MAGIC
MARKER and writes something on a NAPKIN passing it
over to Stanley

Stanley looks dawn reading what he has written
BE CAREFUL THEY ARE WATCHING AND LISTENING

Stanley looks back at the others once again unsure
what to think of things at Camp Green Lake

EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE COURTYARD -- NzxXT

All ninety-six CAMPERS are now assembled in a GIGANTIC
CIRCLE FORMATION

They all hold their SHOVELS and their matching
jumpsuits build a circular WALL OF ORANGE

In the center of the circle is A FLAG POLE which
carries an AMERICAN FLAG at HALF MAST

All SIX COUNSELORS including Pendanski and Mr Sir are
assembled in the center of the circle in a line

formation
At the base of the FLAG POLE is a HUMAN BODY

The BODY is wrapped neatly in a WHITE SHEET and is
placed with its head next to the base of the flag pole

Suddenly several of the campers in the circle across
from Stanley move aside as the WARDEN steps through

The WARDEN (age 52) is an TALL and IMPOSING MAN with a
SHORT MILITARY CREW Gut

WARDEN

As you know Camp Green Lake has
recently lost one of its Campers

(beat)
Twelve days ago Jonathan Gaines
disappeared off the Southwest Sector
after sunset and has not been seen
since then

WARDEN (cont’d)
(beat)
Yesterday afternoon his body was
discovered by one of the counselors
thirty-two miles from here

The campers are all silent A few whispers can be heard

WARDEN
Let this be a reminder to anyone
who chooses to run
(beat)
Running will get you nowhere
(beat)
And if you don’t believe me ask

Jonathan Gaines

The camp is silent

WARDEN
Ask him if it was worth the risk Ask
him if it was worth never seeing
his family again Ask him if it was
work the pain and suffering that his
mother will feel for the rest of her
life

The camp is silent

WARDEN (cont’d)
Jonathan Gaines SAY HIS NAME

CAMPERS
(in perfect unison)
JONATHAN GAINES

The camp is silent

WARDEN
Jonathan Gaines will never know the
glorious victory of a long and moral
life
(beat)
Jonathan Gaines committed suicide
(beat)
In God’s eyes there is no greater
or more cowardly sin than suicide
(beat)
Suicide is the medicine of cowards
and there is no reward for suicide in
God’s kingdom

The camp is silent

WARDEN (cont’d)
Jonathan Gaines will never know the
glory of God’s kingdom

Stanley stares across the circle at Jonathan Gaines’
body and then moves his eyes up toward the Warden

For a moment Stanley is almost certain that the Warden
is staring back at him

EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE -— EAST SECTOR -- NEXT

Stanley is almost 50 finished with his hole He looks
over and sees that ZERO is standing next to him

ZERO
Youre sleeping in his bunk
Stanley looks confused and somewhat intimidated by
Zero
STANLEY
Who
ZERO

Jonathan Gaines You filled the space
that he left open

STANLEY
(leng beat)
Did you know him

ZERO
Not really He didn’t talk much
Seemed kinda sad

STANLEY
Sounds like the two of you had a
lot in common

Zero smiles

ZERO
The way I figure it why talk unless
youve got somethin’ important to say

Stanley smiles at this

ZERO (cont’d)
Most people I know who talk all the
time always tryin’ to be the center
of attention tryin’ to prove to
everyone how tough funny or smart
they are they got the most to hide

STANLEY
(beat)
I guess everybody’s got something to
hide
Zero looks down at the cracked Earth
ZERO
Did they tell you that I killed
somebody
Stanley looks at Zero long and hard

ZERO (cont’d)
Yeah They said that

Zero looks for a moment as if he is about to say

something but then he simply turns and heads back to
his hole

Stanley watches him walk off knowing somehow that this
will be the first of many conversations with Zero
MONTAGE

Stanley is now 95 finished with his hole when

suddenly his shovel HITS SOMETHING

He reaches his hand down into the loose soil and feels a
HARD WHITE OBJECT He digs down further and sees that
the white object is elongated

He eventually gets it loose and we see that it is a
BONE

Stanley examines the bone closely

SOUNDTRACK We hear the screams of children echoing
into the hum of a truck’s engine

Stanley hears someone approaching from above

Stanley takes the bone and puts it into the pocket of his
jumpsuit He then climbs up from his hole with more
coordination than before

He steps out of his hole and sees that it is Pendanski
driving the WATER TRUCK

PENDANSKI
Need a xefill Stanley

Stanley hobbles quickly over to the truck with his
CANTEEN Pendanski takes it and turns the nozzle on the
TANK water flowing into the canteen

He hands it back to Stanley who takes a long desperate
swig

PENDANSKI (cont’d)
Easy now that has to last you until
tomorrow We ration out the water
here Stanley

STANLEY
(lowering the canteen from
his mouth)
Yes sir

PENDANSET
Let me see your hands

Stanley holds them up revealing his BLOODY and BLISTERED
palms

Pendanski cringes at the sight of them

PENDANSKI (cont’d)
I guess I’ve seen worse but let me
tape them up anyway

cur TO
EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE -- EAST SECTOR -- MOMENTS LATER
Stanley now has several layers of TAPE on his hands

STANLEY
Thanks Mom

Pendanski gives Stanley a look that is almost angry
STANLEY
Pendanski why the hell would you want

this job Don’t you have a wife or
kids to tend to

Pendanski puts his FIRST AID KIT in the truck

PENDANSEI
My wife was killed Stanley
STANLEY
In the blast
PENDANSKI
(long beat)
Yes In the blast
STANLEY
So why aren’t you out trying to
find a new wife Why didn’t you move
far away like most everyone else

did

2S

PENDANSKI
(beat)
Why don’t you keep digging and stop
asking so many questions

STANLEY
Sorry

Stanley turns back to the hole Pendanski gets back into
the water truck

Stanley then stops and pulls out the BONE from his
pocket

STANLEY (cont’d)
Pendanski

PENDANSKI
What now

STANLEY
(holding out the bone)
I found this buried

Pendanski gets out of the truck taking the bone from
Stanley examining it closely
PENDANSKI
Looks like a radius or ulna

Pendanski takes a deep breath

PENDANSKI (cont’d)
Is this the only one that you found
Did you dig around it

STANLEY
There could be more I didn’t have
time to check This just happened

Pendanski takes a deep breath contemplating what to
do

PENDANSKI
Next time you find a bone or
anything tell me immediately

(beat)
Now we have to do an excavation

Pendanski turns toward some of the other diggers who
are now FILLING THE CANTEENS from the water truck

PENDANSKI (cont’d)
Excavation team Four men
Upon hearing these words several campers including
Alan X-Ray and Theo SPRINT OVER WITH EAGER
ANTICIPATION

PENDANSKI (contd)
Alright You three
(beat)
We’ve got another body
(turning to Stanley)
Looks like you lucked out Stanley
You get the day off tomorrow

EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE -—- EAST SECTOR -- MOMENTS LATER

Stanley Theo Zero Alan and X-Ray are all digging
around the edge of Stanley’s hole There is a WHITE
BLANKET laid out on the desert floor off to the side

On the blanket they have placed the ULNA and the bones to
the RIGHT HAND in their place at the end of the ARM BONE

X-RAY
Damn you Stanley Second day and you
already found a body Lucky-ass bitch
Why can’t I get a break

ALAN
Shit I been here a year and still
never found a goddamn body

THEO
I found one once
(beat)
It was a little baby

They dig silently for a moment

Pendanski paces around by his truck impatiently There is
a WALKIE TALKIE in his hand

PENDANSKI
(into walkie talkie)
Yes six Just an arm so far Looks
like there’s lots more Buried pretty
far down

They have now unearthed the entire RIGHT HALF of a HUMAN
SKELETON

X-RAY
I always wanted to be an
archeographer

ALAN
Archeologist dumbass

X-RAY
Same difference
(to Stanley)

Stanley listen man I been here
almost a year and I never found
nothin’ You’re gettin’ the day off
tomorrow and you just got here
ALAN
Oh here we go Don’t fall for this
Stanley
STANLEY
It’s not my fault that I have good
luck
THEO

Luck is God’s fault

X-RAY
Listen all I’m sayin’ is if you
find somethin’ else any time soon
give it to me and let me turn it in so
I can get my day off

ALAN
Don’t give him shit Stanley He don’t
deserve it

X-RAY
(to Alan)
Shut up but nugget I dig harder than

anybody here

THEO
Not harder than Zero No one digs
harder than Zero

Stanley thinks for a moment looking down at the
emerging skeleton

STANLEY
Alright You got a deal

The others are surprised at Stanley’s generosity

ALAN
(outraged)
You gotta be kiddin’ me Stanley
you’re a goddamn fool

CUT TO
EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE -- EAST SECTOR -- MOMENTS LATER

The ENTIRE SKELETON is laid out on the blanket There are
crusts of dirt and rock still attached to it but they
have done a fairly decent job of placing all of the bones

in the right places
It stares back at them ominously

STANLEY
I wonder what she was doing when it
happened

X-RAY
How do you know it was a she

STANLEY
The height Hips and shoulders

ALAN
He’s right Definitely a woman Maybe
five foot three

Theo approaches from the hole carrying a tattered and
dirt-covered piece of CLOTHING

THEO
Found some clothing

Pendanski approaches from the truck

PENDANSEI
All finished here

STANLEY
Looks like it

Theo examines the tattered rags and sees that there is
a LABEL on them

He smears mud off of the SEWN LABEL and sees that there
is a NAME SEWN IN CURSIVE

Diane

THEO
Her name was Diane
(beat)
Looks like she was a waitress at
Bob’s Big Boy ox somethin’

Pendanski suddenly looks up from his DIGITAL CLIPBOARD
for a moment his eyes WHITE WITH FEAR

PENDANSKI
What did you just say

Pendanski approaches Theo quickly

PENDANSKI (cont’d)
Let me see that

Pendanski examines the label closely Over by the
SKELETON Stanley is now examining the RIGHT HAND

He scrapes a hardened chunk of crusted dirt off of the
left RING FINGER BONE revealing a DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT

RING

STANLEY
There’s a diamond ring on her finger

Stanley carefully removes the ring from around the
bone examining it

Pendanski approaches Stanley with nervous anticipation

PENDANSEI
Let let me see it

Stanley does not hear him

PENDANSEI (cont’d)
Give me the goddamn ring Stanley

Stanley gives Pendanski the ring and he begins to
examine it closely his face still white

With his thumb he wipes away dirt from the interior of
the band where there is an INSCRIPTION

PENDANSKI (cont’d)
My God

Pendanski falls to his knees

PENDANSKI (cont’d)

My Diane oh dear God it is my
Diane
Pendanski looks over at Stanley who looks almost

afraid to move

And then Pendanski begins to cry
INT CAMP GREEN LAKE -- SUNSET

We pull back from this scene into another HELICOPTER

SHOT gliding ominously over the SEA OF HOLES
NARRATOR

We used to say that coincidences were
God’s way of reminding you that he was
still around That he was watching
every moment of every day

(beat)
That was when I came to be certain
that he was watching Stanley

INT TENT E -- SUNSET

Pendanski is curled up on his cot his face a mask of
detached sorrow as he holds his dead wife’s engagement
ring up into the light

NARRATOR

Pendanski told us to take the bones to
the incinerator And that was all we
heard from him for quite some time

(beat)
Part of me thinks that sometimes if
the timing is right coincidences can
scare people half to death

INT INCINERATOR ROOM -- NEXT

We move across DOZENS OF HUMAN SKULLS stacked neatly on
metal shelves along the edge of the storage room

We then see Stanley and the others standing in front of
the large incinerator the woman’s SKELETON laid out on
the blanket on the cement floor in front of them

They all stare down at Diane’s remains unsure of what
to say

ALAN
Should we say something

X-RAY
It’s a little late for that It’s been
six years

THEO
No he’s right We should say
something

Stanley leans down and picks up Diane’s SKULL from the
blanket He stares at it closely

THEO (cont’d)
May the lord grant you eternal peace
in the kingdom of Heaven

X-RAY
That don’t make no sense If she’s in
Heaven she already been there for
over a year And if she ain’t in
heaven there sure as hell ain’t
nothin’ that we can do for her now

ALAN
Hes right Her fate’s already been
decided
(picking up her bones)
Were just cleaning up the remains In

the end that’s all the living can
do for the dead
(beat)

Clean up the remains and hope one
day that you might run into them on
the other side

They begin to toss her bones into the incinerator

Stanley still stares at the SKULL He rubs his thumb
across Diane’s right cheek bone There is a hint of

sadness behind his eyes

CUT TO FLASHBACK

INT BOB’S BIG BOY -- EVENING

We see DIANE as a YOUNG WOMAN standing against the
wall of the BASEMENT ENTRANCE BREAK ROOM SMOKING A
CIGARETTE as other WAITERS and BUS BOYS scurry around
behind her in the kitchen

After taking a drag she looks out toward nothing in
particular as if pre-occupied by something

Suddenly a BLAST OF WHITE ENVELOPS HER

cur TO

INT INCINERATOR ROOM -—- NEXT

Stanley JOLTS out of his DAYDREAM and he is still
holding her skull while the others pile the last of
her remains into the incinerator

He then carefully places her skull onto the metal shelf
at the end of a long line of them their empty sockets
staring back at him

INT TENT D -- NEXT

Stanley freshly showered approaches his cot seeing
that on the wall above it there is still a tag that
reads GAINES

On the bunk next to Stanley’s Zero is laying on his
back

ZERO
No one here get’s out alive

STANLEY
(turning around)
What did you say

ZERO
Nothing I was just singing Jim
Morrison The Doors

STANLEY
Oh yeah

ZERO

Well get out of here alright
Stanley As long as we play by the
rules dig between the lines

Stanley pulls JONATHAN GAINES’ ID TAG off of the wall

STANLEY
Why did he run

ZERO
I don’t know for sure But I’ve got my
opinion

STANLEY
And what’s your opinion

ZERO
He was a week away from turning
eighteen He got denied parole due
to serve a life sentence in real jail
Adult jail

STANLEY
Saw his shot at an escape and he
took it

ZERO
That’s what most runners are thinking
After putting up with this place for
so long they can’t even imagine what
it must be like to live inside a jail
with bars
STANLEY
Maybe this place isn’t so bad after
all

ZERO
The best part about it is the
repetition

STANLEY
Repetition

ZERO
Yep Digging a hole every day The
repetition of it makes time move
faster in your head But if you were
to do something different each day
your mind would be constantly
distracted by new ideas And that’s
when time moves the slowest When days
start to feel like weeks

STANLEY
I feel like I’ve been here two weeks
already but it’s only been two
days

ZERO

(rolling over)
You just wait Stanley
(beat)
You just wait
Stanley then lays there for a moment closing his eyes

Stanley slowly closes his eyes as the words DARE HIM
TO FORGET
EXT TEXAS SUBURBS -- DAY

SOUNDTRACK dream-like screaming children

We crane down to the BACKYARD of a midsize RANCH HOUSE on
a middle class suburban street

There is a SWIMMING POOL and there is a POOL PARTY in
full swing

Dozens of KIDS are CHICKEN FIGHTING in the pool water
splashing everywhere Adjacent to the pool in the
YARD there is a SLIP N’ SLIDE going

We STEADICAM through the crowd of children teenagers
and parents following YOUNGER STANLEY (age 15) as he
runs along the edge of the pool with a HUGE SUPER-SOAKER

WATER GUN

KID’S VOICE
Hey Stanley over there

Stanley then heads over toward the GRASS SECTION of the
yard where the Slip N’ Slide is set up adjacent to the

BACK PATIO
A LARGE BANNER hangs on the back of the house
It reads HAPPY BIRTHDAY REBECCA

Stanley turns toward the house where his SISTER
REBECCA (age 8) is standing in a line of other LITTLE
GIRLS They are all wrapped in TOWELS and are POSING
FOR A PHOTOGRAPH

Stanley’s FATHER JOE KRAMER (age 38) is standing
across from the girls with a CAMERA

JOE
All right girls on three One
two three

Just before Stanley’s father can snap the photograph
Stanley launches the Super-Soaker sending a GIANT
STREAM OF WATER in the girls’ direction
As they get hit with the water they all FLEE
SCREAMING

Stanley’s MOTHER SUE KRAMER(age 35) comes out of the
house

SUE
Stanley Get inside now

Stanleys father then grabs the Super-Soaker from Stanley
and hands it to REBECCA who is angrily waiting to
exact her revenge

JOE
Fire away sweetheart

REBECCA
(aiming the pistol)
Youre such a jerk

She then sprays him with water but he quickly runs
toward the house

STANLEY
Too slow

INT KRAMER HOUSE KITCHEN -- NEXT

Stanley bounds inside through the sliding glass door
where his mother is placing the candles on Rebecca’s

BIRTHDAY CARE

SUE
I want you to carry your Sister’s cake
outside and lead the singing

STANLEY
Awww Mom Why me

SUE
Because I asked you to And because it
will mean a lot to her

STANLEY
I’m not doin’ it
SUE

(beat)
And Jimmy and Randy can’t sleep over
tonight
She raises her eyebrows knowing that she has him on

the ropes

STANLEY
That’s blackmail You can’t do that
SUE
(exasperated)
Oh I can’t Watch me
Sue then holds out the birthday cake and Stanley
reluctantly takes it from her
He gives his mother a SNEER and then moves outside
with it

EXT KRAMER HOUSE BACKYARD -- NEXT

Stanley comes onto the back deck carrying the cake with
its 8 LIT CANDLES

STANLEY
(loud and obnoxious)
Happy Birthday to you

The rest of the crowd begins to join in singing Rebecca
smiles

STANLEY (cont’d)
Happy Birthday dear Rebecca

He places the cake on the PICNIC TABLE in front of her

STANLEY (cont’d)
Happy Birthday to you

Everyone claps as Rebecca approaches the cake wrapped
in her towel smiling ear to ear

STANLEY (cont’d)
Happy Birthday stupidhead Don’t
forget to make a wish

Rebecca then sticks her tongue out at Stanley And leans
down to blow out her candles

(NOTE Just as Rebecca leans down toward the cake we
go into SLOW MOTION as she extinguishes her candles

EXT SWIMMING POOL -- LATER
NOTE The following sequence is also in SLOW MOTION

We see Stanley and several other CHILDREN ambush the
swimming pool “s

We follow Stanley as he runs around the edge toward the
DIVING BOARD

He runs to the end bouncing off the edge UP INTO
THE AIR

Just as Stanley has reached his PEAK HEIGHT THE SKY
EXPLODES WITH WHITE LIGHT

INT UNDERWATER -- NEXT

We follow Stanley as he plunges into the BLUE WATER
seeing the FLAILING ARMS AND LEGS of the other
children as the water suddenly has taken on A SURRBAL
WHITE GLOW slowly fading back to normal

EXT SWIMMING POOL -- NEXT

Stanley rises to the surface to the SOUND OF SILENCE
and he LOOKS UP AT THE SKY

A GIGANTIC MUSHROOM CLOUD IS FORMING

As the WHITE CLOUD looks down on him from the blue sky
Stanley looks up in horror desperately treading water
as people begin to SCREAM parents grabbing their
children from the pool

curt TO
(NOTE REPEAT SHOT IN SLOWER MOTION

Once again we see Stanley jumping off the diving board
into the white blast

NARRATOR
Every generation has its moment of
disaster a moment in time when
suddenly the world takes one giant
step backward

We see Stanley treading motionless in the pool as
people panic around him

NARRATOR (cont’d)
One might say that for our

grandparents’ generation it was the
moment of the assassination of John F
Kennedy

Stanley’s father screaming for him to get out of the
pool

NARPATOR (cont’d)
And for our parents’ generation it
was the moment of the disastrous
explosion of the space shuttle
Challenger

listen to some music

X-RAY
What music They ain’t got crap to
listen to

ALAN
Stanley don’t listen to none of your

ZERO
You know there’s a theory that
country music is what started the war
That the most dangerous weapon on
earth isn’t the bomb but bad taste
in music

Bad taste Now that’s the definition
of White American Culture if you ask

appears nervous as if expecting someone to come over

to the table

Zero then breaks the silence

EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE COURTYARD -- NEXT
Stanley walks through the courtyard as dozens of other
campers walk by with their shovels jumping into their
assigned TRUCKS where the counselors will take them
out to their assigned sectors
Two other CAMPERS approach Stanley giving him a weird
look

CAMPER 1

Hes the one He’s the one I told you

about

CAMPER 2
He found Pendanski’s wife

CAMPER 1
Yeah Right next to Pendanski

As they pass they look at Stanley in awe

INT REC ROOM -- NEXT

Stanley walks through the door of the REC ROOM It is a
fairly large rectangular room with two COUCHES a

battered FOOSBALL TABLE 4 battered POOL TABLE and a
battered JUKEBOX

He walks slowly over to the Jukebox and begins to
shuffle through the limited number of COMPACT DISCS

There are only FOUR OF THEM in the DISC CASES

LED ZEPELLIN FOUR
NIRVANA UNPLUGGED IN NEW YORK

CREDENCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL GREATEST HITS

Oldies I can handle

He hits the buttons for Metallica SONG 4

Biter a few moments METALLICA’S “THE UNFORGIVEN” booms
over the loudspeakers

Stanley backs away from the Jukebox slowly intoxicated
by the guitar and drums

METALLICA
New blood joins this Earth And
quickly he’s subdued Through constant
pained disgrace The young boy learns
their rules

Stanley begins to ROCK OUT to the music

METALLICA (cont’d)
With time the child draws in This
whipping boy done wrong Deprived of
all his thoughts The young man
struggles on and on he’s known

Stanley begins to play AIR GUITAR

METALLICA (cont’d)
A vow unto his own That never from
this day His will they’1ll take away

Stanley turms around still playing the air guitar
and sees that the WARDEN is standing right behind hin

Stanley freezes not knowing what to do The song goes
into CHORUS

WARDEN
What is that

STANLEY
(long beat)
Six Air guitar sir

WARDEN
No I mean this song What is it

METALLICA
They dedicate their lives To running
all of his He tries to please them
all This bitter man he is

STANLEY
Metallica sir

WARDEN
Metallica This music of the devil

STANLEY
(gaining confidence)
Six

Qa

WARDEN
Music of the devil It was once
thought by the conservative
establishment that this music was

satanic
STANLEY

Do you want me to turn it off six
WARDEN

No You are allowed to do as you wish
on your day off You are not breaking
any rules

STANLEY
This song it reminds me of my
father
WARDEN
Your father He was lost
STANLEY
Yeah he was one of the first to go
(beat)

My dad used to listen to lots of
classic 90s rock My mom was always
telling him to turn it down

WARDEN
Do you miss them

The Warden begins to pace around the room

STANLEY
Yes sir
(beat)
But I’m starting to forget what they
looked like

The Warden analyzes the Jukebox

STANLEY (cont’d)
Sir may I speak freely

WARDEN
Like I said it’s your day off You
may speak and do as you wish

STANLEY
(long beat)
Six what exactly are we digging for

The Warden turns his head abruptly surprised at
Stanleys directness
WARDEN
We aren’t digging for any specific
object We are digging because the act
itself has meaning Therapeutic value
Digging builds character Repetition

STANLEY
(repeat)
Repetition

METALLICA
(chorus)
What I’ve felt What I’ve known Never
shined through in what I’ve shown

WARDEN
Nothing strengthens the body and the
mind more than repetition It trains
the mind to stand attention to a task
and not tire not hesitate not
forget

METALLICA
Never be Never see Never see what
might have been

WARDEN
Repetition brings discipline Disciple
brings order Order brings peace

METALLICA
Never free Never me So I dub thee
unforgiven

WARDEN
That is our duty before God Does that
answer your question Stanley

Stanley thinks for 4 moment

STANLEY
Yes

The Warden turns away once again The song comes to an
end

STANLEY (cont’d)
But I still think that’s all a crock
of shit

The Warden stops in his tracks and then slowly turns
around toward Stanley

There is rage behind his eyes- but he does not reveal
Lt
STANLEY (cont’d)
(suddenly nervous)
You said I could speak freely

WARDEN
Yes And that you are

STANLEY
I can see part of your point The
physical exercise of digging it’s

like working out Lifting weights
every day to get stronger
(beat)
But digging holes does nothing but
destroy the earth It makes it weak
and unstable so that you can’t build a
house on it or drive a car across it
(beat)
Digging holes is nothing but a stupid
and pointless exercise Kind of like
when it’s the last day of school
before summer break and your
teacher makes you write an essay about
Canada And at the end of the day she
just takes all the essays and throws

‘em in the garbage because no one
really gives a shit about Canada
(beat)

Because in the end it’s just busy
work Busy work to pass the time
and keep you from goofing off

The Warden does not blink

STANLEY (cont’d)
So that’s what digging holes is to me
Busy work

(beat)
Unless we’re looking for something in
particular
(beat)
Six
The Warden approaches Stanley slowly getting right
into his face
WARDEN

Tell me about Rebecca Stanley
This hits Stanley like a brick to the face

STANLEY
What do you want to know She’s

gone

WARDEN

I kmow I’ve read your file Stanley
I know all about you I know that you
are an educated young man Which makes
it all the more disappointing what you
did to get here

(whispering in his ear)
I kmow all about the sins that you
have committed against God

(beat)
I know that you are in danger of
eternal damnation I know that you
feel incredible guilt and remorse for
your crime

(beat)
I know that the guilt is tearing you
apart
Stanley is silent because he knows that the Warden is

not wrong
WARDEN (cont’d)
You have a gift Stanley You have a
gift and you must use it to find

Gods forgiveness You must dig to
find his forgiveness

And then the Warden turns and heads silently to the door

WARDEN (contd)
Enjoy the rest of your day off

And then he is gone leaving Stanley alone

EXT TEXAS INTERSTATE — NIGHT

Along the edge of the interstate Stanley and his family
are pushed through a SCREAMING CROWD among dozens of
STALLED VEHICLES toward an ARMY TRUCK

Almost immediately there was
confusion There was no drill to
follow There was no emergency
broadcast system There were no rules

NARRATOR (cont’d)

And when the rules slip away

confusion becomes chaos

and chaos
becomes anarchy

Stanleys MOTHER grabs for Rebecca’s hand

SUE
Hold onto my hand Rebecca

Sue is pulled away from Rebecca and Stanley by the crowd

SUE (cont’ d)

Stanley grabs his sister’s hand as the crowd further
separates them from their parents

Suddenly an ARMY GUARD grabs Rebecca from the crowd

Wait I’m her brother

ARMY GUARD
You too then

SUE

(pulled further away)
Stanley

Stanley and Rebecca are lifted up into the back of the
army truck along with other children

STANLEY

Wait my parents aren’t with us

Without listening

the Army Guard closes the gate to the
truck and it begins to drive o

f£ along the shoulder of
the interstate

NARRATOR

Those who escaped the epicenter of the

blast also escaped the sickness
that followed

We see Stanley and Rebecca looking out the back of the
truck

But then sickness can also get
hidden in the chaos
We move in toward Rebecca who stares back at the
moving world behind her in shock

CALLUSED

But we endured And we followed the
Warden’s rules

(beat)
Because there was always one thing to
look forward to

EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE COURTYARD —- NEXT

The campers stand in the GREAT CIRCLE around the FLAGPOLE

a smirk

against Alan and X-Ray

Pendanski walks through the crowded room amused at the
shenanigans He approaches Alan WHISPERING something
in his ear

Alan pauses for 4 moment nodding his head

EXT THE LAST STOP -- NEXT

Stanley and the others approach THE LAST STOP another
building on the other side of the Way Station

There is an ORANGE NEON SIGN hanging above the entrance
to the one story stone building
Several drunken MILITARY OFFICERS stumble out of the door
with WOMEN on their arms BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN’S “BORN TO
RUN” can be heard blaring inside

Stanley and the others stare at the women as they walk
past

They all POUND their beers simultaneously
CUT TO
INT THE LAST STOP -- NEXT

Stanley is sitting at a table across from Pendanski
PENDANSKI
How are you dealing with all of this
Stanley

Stanley thinks for a moment

STANLEY
Fine I guess I thought the time
would go by really slow you know

(beat)
But it doesn’t Time flies when you

don’t pay attention to it

PENDANSKI
How much longer

STANLEY
Till when

PENDANSKI
Till you turn eighteen

STANLEY
About a year

Pendanski nods his head slowly

STANLEY (cont’d)
You read my file
(beat)
You know what I did to get here

Pendanski nods his head slowly

STANLEY (cont’d)
Things are gonna get a whole lot worse
for me when I turn eighteen aren’t
they

Pendanski is silent for a moment knowing that he is
delivering the grim truth

PENDANSEL
Given the severity of your crime
you’ve got maybe a ten percent chance
of getting paroled only if you’ve
got letters of recommendation
STANLEY
Which I don’t

PENDANSEI
Most likely they’1l put you down in
one of the camps in Mexico Maybe even
South America

Stanley nods his head slowly He then takes a sip from
his beer

PENDANSKI (cont’d)

I wouldn’t lie to you Stanley Those
are tough places Compared to adult
prison Camp Green Lake is like summer
camp

(beat)
I tell you that only because I’m not
pretending to be nice to you

(beat)
I’m not pretending to be your friend

Stanley nods his head long and hard for the first time
confronting the severe turn that his life has taken

PENDANSKI (cont’d)
I am your friend Stanley

Stanley nods his head

PENDANSKI (cont’d)

Youre too smart too good of a kid to
have deserved this It’s not fair the
way things worked out for you

(beat)
But no matter how bad it gets don’t
you ever run Because trust me this
desert goes farther than you ever will
on foot Just ask Jonathan Gaines I
found his body and I don’t ever want
to find yours

STANLEY

Kind of ironic isn’t it A prison
without walls

(trying to change the

subject)
Is this all because I found your wife
Did it let you bury her memory
seeing her that one last time

Pendanski thinks for a long moment sipping his beer
PENDANSEI

This may sound crazy but ever since
that day I can’t remember her
PENDANSKI (cont’d)
(beat)
She’s forgotten

STANLEY
Sometimes I wish I could just forget
I wish that I could just come down
with amnesia
(beat)
Start over from scratch in some
faraway place

PENDANSKI
You can Stanley And you will
(beat)
It just you’1l be about fifty years

old when it happens

Somehow Stanley manages to laugh at this acknowledging
truth

PENDANSKI (cont’d)
You know what We need to get you boys
drunk
(looking over at the bar)
And we need to get you boys laid

Stanley smiles jokingly pretending to fix his hair

STANLEY

Motley Crue before all this huh

ZERO
Don’t remind me of the past I’1l

INT THE LAST STOP -- NEXT

Pendanski is across the room talking to two
twentysomething women

Zero and Stanley shoot pool nonchalantly trying to
hide the fact that they are both nervous as hell

X-Ray is stewing with Alan at the bar a line of SHOTS
in front of them courtesy of Derek

DEREK
Drown your sorrows in booze fellas
Then maybe you can try to get some
without having to pay for it

X-RAY
Can you keep a secret Derek

DEREK

They are both worn out but certainly not unattractive

PENDANSEI

Stanley and Stacey follow them up the steps

Pendanski smiles as they disappear upstairs feeling
some sense of closure for a debt that has finally been

paid

Stanley and Stacey walk into the TINY room where there is
a RED LIGHT BEADS and a COUCH
She goes over to the BUREAU and lights several candles

STACEY
How old are you

She smiles touching his face

He awkwardly goes to KISS HER but she pulls back

STACEY
No kissing on the mouth

STANLEY
Sorry

She begins to take off her clothes

Stanley does the same When she is completely
undressed she walks him over to the couch handing
him a CONDOM

STACEY
Now let’s put this on

STANLEY (cont’d)
You don’t have to worry I’m clean

STACEY
It’s not you I’m worried about honey

CUT TO

INT UPSTAIRS PRIVATE ROOM -- NEXT

Stanley is now on top of her on the couch and they
awkwardly begin to make love

About FIFTEEN SECONDS LATER Stanley climaxes

They are both quiet for a moment as if he is unsure of
what to do next

STANLEY
So was that as good for me as it
was for you

For a moment she stares at him wanting to laugh
STANLEY (cont’d)
That was a joke you’re supposed to
laugh now i

And then she does She laughs long and hard

STANLEY (contd)
You’ re not supposed to laugh that
hard

STACEY
I’m sorry

STANLEY
You’re hurting my feelings I just

hurting my feelings

STACEY
I didn’t know I would have been
more delicate with you

STANLEY

They begin to put their clothes back on

STANLEY
(beat)
Why do you do this
STACEY

STACEY
Right

talked to a woman

(beat)
It’s been so long

STACEY
I‘m sorry

STANLEY
Can you just

Stanley does not know how to say this without sounding
stupid

But somehow she understands what he is asking of her
and she walks over and embraces him

For quite some time he stands there in her arms and
she runs her fingers through his hair and for a moment
it appears as if he is about to cry

EXT TEXAS DESERT -- HELICOPTER SHOT -- SUNRISE

We approach the laundry truck as it zooms across the
desert back toward Camp Green Lake

Stanley and Zero look at each other and neither of
them can stop grinning

Alan and X-Ray are bitter

ALAN
You wipe that smile off your face
there Zero

Stanley looks out into the desert and once again he is
reminded of something from the past

CUT TO FLASHBACK

EXT WOODS -- NIGHT

Stanley and Rebecca are running through the woods
GUNFIRE can be heard in the distance

Stanley is in front and Rebecca is trailing behind

REBECCA
Stanley wait

STANLEY
We have to hurry

Suddenly Rebecca trips and falls to the ground

Stanley turns to go back and help her to hex feet but
he quickly realizes that the fall has knocked the wind

out of her

STANLEY (cont’d)
(holding her hand)
Take deep breaths Deep breaths

She breathes in deeply but soon she begins to cough
severely

REBECCA
(through her coughing)
Te s HUTES sss

STANLEY
Itll be alright Just keep breathing

But soon Rebecca is coughing up blood

Stanley looks over at THEO from his bunk

THEO
Roll call

EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE COURTYARD -- NEXT

All of the campers are once again assembled in a GIANT
CIRCLE in the courtyard The Warden and Mr Sir are
talking in the center

Stanley looks over at Zero and Alan worried Pendanski
is nowhere to be found

WARDEN
It has been brought to my attention
that four men were left unaccounted
for yesterday evening

Everyone is silent

WARDEN (cont’d)

them long and hard He then turns to Theo

WARDEN
White Step forward

Theo steps forward from the circle

THEO
Sir yes sir
WARDEN
Did you leave on the laundry truck
last night

THEO
Sir no sir

The Warden pauses for a moment He then nods toward Mr
Sir who walks over carrying his rifle

WARDEN
Thank you for telling the truth

Mr Sir then jabs the but of his gun fiercely into Theo’s
stomach He falls to the ground the wind knocked out

of him
Stanley winces looking over at Zero

Mr Six then kicks Theo once again in the stomach
while he is doubled over on the ground

Suddenly Stanley steps forward

STANLEY
It was me

The Warden and Mr Sir then turn toward Stanley

STANLEY (cont’d)
Sir I left on the truck last night

Zero steps forward

ZERO
Sir I left on the truck last night

WARDEN
(long beat)

That’s only two

He looks back at Mr Sir who gives Theo one more kick
to the ribs leaving him writhing in pain

Alan reluctantly steps forward

ALAN
Sir I was with them

Finally X-Ray steps forward as well

X-RAY
Sir so was I

The Warden approaches Stanley

PL
WARDEN
I certainly hope that it was worth it

STANLEY
Sir yes siz

The Warden appears genuinely shocked

STANLEY (cont‘d)
It was worth every second getting out
of this shithole sir
(beat)
It was worth every moment not having
to look at your fucking face

You could hear a pin drop

STANLEY (cont’d)
Stop beating Theo sir If you’re
going to punish anybody punish the
one’s who deserve it sir

Theo is now coughing up blood The Warden nods over to
Mr Sir who with a malevolent grin kicks Theo once

again

Stanley breaks out of the circle running over toward
Mr Sir He then tries to TACKLE him but Mr Sir
quickly knocks Stanley to the ground

He then places his BOOT onto Stanley’s throat closing
off his windpipe

Stanley struggles to free himself but he is quickly
suffocating

ZERO
Let him go
Zero then rushes toward Mr Sir Alan then follows and

it appears for a moment that a MUTINY is about to
explode

Mr Sir quickly puts the end of his gun to Stanley’s
head

MR SIR
Come any closer and I’1l shoot him

Zero does not budge Stanley is almost unconscious
Theo is still coughing in serious pain

MR SIR (cont’d)
Get back in line

“he

X-RAY
Do it Zero Step back
Zero and Alan retreat and finally Mr Sir lifts his
boot up from Stanley throat leaving him gasping for
aie

The Warden walks over to them

WARDEN

(to the group)
Because of this unfortunate setback
we will now dig two holes a day

(right into Stanley’s face)
Thank you Stanley Thank you for
providing us with this opportunity to
grow

And then the Warden is gone

MR SIR
You heard the Warden Get your
shovels Let’s go

The circle disbands as people rush back to get their
shovels Stanley struggles to his feet and then goes
over to Theo

STANLEY

I’m so sorry Theo I’m so sorry
THEO

Youre forgiven Stanley You’re

forgiven

He then reaches out his hand pulling Theo up to his
feet

Canteen and places it under the water spigot filling
it up
MR SIR
Thirsty
STANLEY
Yes sir
Once the Canteen is filled Mr Sir holds it out to

Stanley But before Stanley can retrieve it from him
Mr Sir pulls it back turns it on its side and dumps the
water out onto the sand

EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE -- EAST SECTOR -- DAYS LATER

Stanley is once again digging almost finished with his
hole

NARRATOR
They say that coincidences are God’s
way of reminding you that he is still
around

Suddenly Stanley’s shovel hits metal
He pauses looking down into the dirt curiously

NARRATOR (cont’d)
And once again Stanley was reminded
of this

He reaches down into the dirt and pulls out an UNUSUAL
METAL OBJECT that is about the size of a HAMMER It has
many facets and ATTACHMENTS on it hinting that is was
once attached to something much larger

STANLEY
What the hell
Yo

Stanley looks over at Zero who is quietly digging
several yards away There are large BLACK CIRCLES under

his eyes

STANLEY
Hey Zero come check this out

Zero walks over and begins to examine the Hammer object
with Stanley

ZERO
Looks like a spark plug
STANLEY
Yeah but a spark plug to what

came off something complicated
(beat)
You gonna turn it in
STANLEY

the hole to expand further out

As they dump the EXCESS DIPT the COUNSELORS sift
through it to see if anything has been missed

In the distance engines can be heard as THREE MILITARY
TRUCKS approach

Stanley looks up and sees this glancing over at Zero
as if to say holy shit

X-Ray is now exuberant

X-RAY
I told you so I found it

THEO
(terrified)
Be quiet You don’t know what you

found

7S
The MILITARY OFFICERS get out of their trucks and
approach the Warden saluting him
OFFICER

Six full lighting excavation
equipment is on standby

WARDEN
Set up the lights We switch up at
sundown

DISSOLVE MONTAGE

The hole is now more than twenty feet across in diameter
The sun has begun to go down leaving the sky purple
and red approaching sunset

WARDEN
We will dig into the night at
sundown we switch up and again

at sunrise

The OFFICERS have begun to setup large KLEIG LIGHTS in
the back of the trucks

There are now more than TWO DOZEN CAMPERS digging the
hole

Stanley and Zero are digging on the south end Both
appear EXHAUSTED dumping theix shovels full of dirt
into the wheelbarrows which are then taken up an
UPHILL PATH that has been established on the north end of

the hole

STANLEY
(whispering)
Hey Zero what are you thinking

ZERO
(looking over his shoulder)
I’m thinking we’ve got some
information that the Warden might be
interested in

STANLEY
Geographic information

ZERO
Yep

They dig silently for a moment

STANLEY
I’m thinking I still want to keep that
information to myself right now

Bl

ZERO
(long beat)
Until we can discuss things a little
further I can keep a secret if you
can
STANLEY
Just you and me we’re the only ones
that know
Suddenly an OFFICER is standing above them on the edge
of the hole
OFFICER

Hey
Stanley and Zero look up at the officer

He then JABS the but of his gun into Stanley’s stomach
He falls to the ground in pain Zero looks up at the
officer terrified that he heard their conversation

OFFICER (contd)
Nobody stops until sundown Keep
digging

Zero helps Stanley to his feet and then quickly jabs his
shovel down into the dirt

SUNDOWN
The KLEIG LIGHTS now illuminate the hole which is more
than FORTY FEET ACROSS and FIFTEEN FEET DEEP

The Warden paces around the perimeter with a MEGAPHONE in
his hand Mr Siz is with him He is also wearing
military fatigues and his head has been shaved into a4

crew cut

WARDEN
(into megaphone)
ROLL CALL IN FIVE DAY CREW ONLY

MR SIR
YOU HEARD HIM LET’S GO

All of the exhausted Campers walk up the WHEEL BARROW
PATH to the surface

Stanley Zero and the others all have black circles under
their eyes

Alan looks down at his hands and sees that they are RED
and BLISTERED He looks over at X-Ray

ALAN
(to X-Ray)
What the hell did you find X-Ray
X-RAY
I told you some kind of Hammer

One of the officers knocks X-Ray to the ground with the
butt of his gun sending him reeling into the dirt

OFFICER
NO TALKING

X-Ray slowly gets back to his feet joining the line of
Campers

EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE -- WEST SECTOR -- LATER THAT NIGHT

From above we see the diggers expanding the hole under
the harsh glare of the kleig lights Several more
MILITARY TRUCKS have arrived as the hole is now more

than forty feet across

The Warden continues to pace around the perimeter
obsessively

INT REC ROOM -- NEXT

Stanley and Zero are the only ones in the room Both look
exhausted Stanley walks over to the jukebox and shuffles
through the CDs choosing LED ZEPPELIN’S “STAIRWAY TO

HEAVEN”

As the music blares they walk over and sit on the couch

NOTE The following dialogue scene is played out in
SUBTITLES due to the intentionally loud music

STANLEY
(whispering)
We have to whisper

ZERO
I know

STANLEY
Should we tell the Warden

ZERO
Do you want to tell the Warden

Stanley thinks for a moment

STANLEY
No

ZERO
Me neither

They are both silent for a moment

STANLEY
But how long will they dig before
they figure out that it isn’t there

ZERO
I don’t know But it looks like
they’re prepared to dig straight to
the center of the Earth

STANLEY
This could go on forever

ZERO
They’1l never be able to find it
without us Stanley
(beat)
What if we tell them but demand
that they parole us first

STANLEY
We both know they would beat the truth
out of us We’re not in a position to

negotiate

ZERO
I’m up for parole next week This
could be my last chance to live a
normal life This could be our ticket
out Stanley They don’t care about
us they just care about what’s buried

out there

STANLEY
But if we tell then we admit to
lying to throwing them off on

purpose What if that is cause for
punishment and not reward

ZERO
Sounds like either way we could be
screwed

STANLEY
Either way you’re right about one
thing

ZERO

What’s that

STANLEY
The Warden doesn’t care about us
Either way we’re slaves Disposable
interchangeable and replaceable

They are silent for a moment

ZERO
There is one more option

STANLEY
And what is that

ZERO
Run like hell

Stanley silently admits to himself that running might be
the only viable option they have left as the music blares
on

INT TENT D -- NIGHT

Stanley and Zero are lying in their beds both awake X-
Ray approaches them

X-RAY
Hey Stanley

Stanley looks around to see if any of them can hear them

STANLEY
What

K-RAY
What should we do

STANLEY
Nothing We’re damned if we do damned
if we don’t The Warden will make an
example out of both of us for lying
He will never reward a liar no
matter how much he benefits from one

X-Ray nods his head and then goes back to his drink
We move over to THEO’S cot and we see that he is wide
awake having heard their entire conversation

EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE -- WEST SECTOR -- SUNRISE

AS the sun comes over the horizon the day crew of
campers passes the night crew as they trudge out of the
GIGANTIC PIT

It is now more than seventy feet across and fifteen
feet deep

NARRATOR
After the first night all that had
been found was a body

We see a full skeleton laid out ona sheet with the
tattered rags of clothing next to it

NARRATOR (cont’d)
He was an auto mechanic named Gordon
Barclay

We see the Warden scraping the mud off of his TEXAS
DRIVERS LICENSE with his muddy wallet in his other
hand where there is a TEXACO ID CARD He then turns to
Mr Sir who is standing with Anthony and several other

campers

WARDEN
Take it to the incinerator

They begin to cart the body off

NARRATOR
As we suspected Gordon Barclay
wasn’t what the Warden was looking

£6x

EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE -- WEST SECTOR -- LATE AFTERNOON

Anthony is now tearing at the side of the pit wall with a
PICK AXE He begins to chip at what looks like CONCRETE

Suddenly a stream of WATER sprays out of the pit wall
Anthony jumps back in surprise

ANTHONY
Water

Suddenly a large section of the pit wall COLLAPSES
and HUNDREDS OF GALLONS OF WATER come crashing into the

pit
Campers begin to run away from the furious torrent of
water some of them falling to the ground

On the to ledge of the pit one of the MILITARY
OFFICERS turms suddenly noticing the onslaught of water

filling the pit

In his right hand he is holding a LIT CIGARETTE and he
quickly throws it down into the pit without thinking

As the water spreads into the center of the pit we see
it flow into channels of dirt toward the lit cigarette
When the water collides with the cigarette we see that
the water suddenly CATCHES ON FIRE

Pendanski is the first one to discover this and he
turns and runs up toward the perimeter of the pit

PENDANSKI
(screaming)
GET OUT OF THE PIT IT’S GASOLINE
GET OUT OF THE PIT

Seeing the fire spread toward the source Campers begin
to scramble desperately to get away from the fire

One Camper barely makes it out of the ankle deep flow
before his PANTS become engulfed in flames He falls to
the ground and Pendanski throws a blanket on top of
his legs distinguishing them just in time

As Pendanski pulls the camper from the spreading fire
others DESPERATELY SCRAMBLE TO THE EDGE

Eventually the fire spreads into a GIGANTIC BLAZE
covering the entire bottom of the pit sending black
smoke up into the purple sky

The Warden Military Officers and Campers stare down into
the fire in awe as if what they are witnessing is some

sort of miracle
Stanley and Zero look at one another in shock

CUT TO FLASHBACK

EXT TEXACO STATION -- DAY

We see GORDON BARCLAY standing down in the pit underneath
a PICKUP TRUCK suspended above him He reaches up for a
WRENCH from another MECHANIC and we see the GAS PUMPS
on the TARMAC beyond the GARAGE

NARRATOR
We imagined Gordon Barclay as a ghost
left to haunt this reservoir of
fire ready to explode in a fury of
revenge

From beyond the TARMAC we see the SKY EXPLODE INTO
WHITE

CUT TO
EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE -- WEST SECTOR -- SUNSET

As the fire RAGES ON the WARDEN screams at the Campers
to begin throwing dirt down onto its

As they follow the Warden’s orders throwing shovel
after shovel of dirt onto the fire the Warden stares
down in a furious rage before the glowing Kleig lights
knowing that something is most certainly wrong

Stanley and Zero are digging next to Theo who looks
over at them with a suspicious glare
NARRATOR
It took us four hours to put out the

fire

The BURNED CAMPER is laying down on a STRETCHER
surrounded by Officers who apply dressings to his
legs

NARRATOR (cont’d)
Mickey Johansen suffered second degree
burns to his legs but it turned out
to be the best thing that ever
happened to him He got his parole
eight months early

EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE -- COURTYARD -- NIGHT

As Stanley Zero X-Ray and the others walk back toward
Tent D Theo places his hand on Stanley’s shoulder

THEO
(looking straight into his
eyes)
Everything happens for a reason The
fire was no coincidence It was God
Stanley It was God showing us the
way home

And having said this Theo turns and walks off alone
into the night

NARRATOR
And that was the last time that we
ever saw Theo

Stanley Zero Alan and X-Ray watch as he walks away from
him not knowing what to say

INT WARDEN’S OFFICE -- NEXT

The Warden sits alone behind his desk with his jaw
clenched staring back at his maps where the PIT
DIMENSIONS are now obsessively drawn out

There is a KNOCK at his door

WARDEN
Come in

The door opens and Mr Sir steps into the office with
Theo

MR SIR
Six this gentleman has something that
he wants to share with you

Theo walks up to the Warden his face white and his
eyes bloodshot He looks as if at any moment he could
burst out into tears

The Warden then takes Theo’s hands into his and flips
them over revealing the deep scars on his wrists

And then the Warden nods his head to Theo knowing that
the truth will come sooner than he expected

INT TENT D -- EARLY THE NEXT MORNING

Stanley is wrestled from his dreams by Mr Sir who
stands over his cot with his gun drawn He turns and sees
that Zero and X-Ray are also already awake He sees that

Theo’s bunk is empty

MR SIR
Get dressed Now

Alan sits up in his bunk watching his three best
friends walk out of the tent somehow knowing that he
will never see any of them again

EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE -- EAST SECTOR -- SUNRISE

Stanley Zero and X-Ray are now sitting in the back of
Mr Sir’s DODGE PICKUP TRUCK driving out into the east

sector across the sand

They stare at one another silently with their faces to
the wind

EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE -- EAST SECTOR —- MOMENTS LATER

The truck arrives out in a remote section where the
Warden is standing next to Theo on the edge of a freshly

dug hole

Mr Six motions for them to get out of the cab and
they follow one another toward the Warden who assesses

them silently

WARDEN
Good morning
(beat)
I understand that the three of you
have some information regarding our
current excavation

None of them respond

WARDEN (cont’d)
Once again if you have any
information regarding the current
misguided excavation please speak

now
(beat)
Or else

STANLEY
Six may I speak freely siz

The Warden approaches Stanley slowly

WARDEN
Yes you may

STANLEY
Sir what are we digging for

WARDEN
(long beat)
Something important

STANLEY
No shit six What is it

WARDEN
Something more important than you Do
you know where the rest of it is

Stanley is quiet for a moment and he glances over at
Zero

STANLEY
Six it is irresponsible for me to
answer that question unless I know the
repercussions

The Warden nods his head to Mr Sir who jabs his gun
into Theo’s stomach sending him onto the ground

Stanley winces at this

WARDEN
There will be repercussions either
way

STANLEY

Sir I can’t be held responsible for
what might happen if what you’re
looking for is something dangerous I
cannot live with that guilt
The Warden nods his head once again to Mr Sir who
then kicks Theo once again in the stomach Mr Sir then
shoves Theo over and he falls into the hole with a thud

From down inside you can hear him crying

Zero looks as if he is on the verge of tears X-Ray
simply stares down at the ground

WARDEN
Because of your actions the innocent
have already suffered have they not

STANLEY
(fiercely)
No sir they have not

WARDEN
Tell me did you dig your sister’s
grave before you killed her

Stanley’s face is rigid He does not respond

The Warden nods once again to Mr Sir who then takes a
shovel and begins to throw dirt down onto Theo

X-RAY
Tell him Stanley For Chrissakes tell
him

The Warden pulls out a piece of paper and holds it up in
Zero’s face

WARDEN
You see this This is a pardon This
document guarantees your parole If
you tell me where it is you’1ll be out
of here tomorrow

Mr Six continues to throw piles of dirt down onto Theo
burying him alive

X-RAY
Tell him Just tell him where you
found it
Stanley looks over at Zero as if to say please don’t

ZERO
I found it It was over a month ago
QDD 209 Southwest sector

The Warden looks at him long and hard

He then takes the pardon slip and TEARS IT INTO LITTLE
PIECES Zero’s eyes slowly close
WARDEN
Tomorrow all three of you will be
sent south to the camps
(to Mr Sir)
Lock them in the incinerator room

Mr Sir turns his back on the hole and approaches them

MR SIR
You heard him Let’s go

And then suddenly Zero turns around and RUNS SOUTHWEST
AS FAST AS HE CAN

X-RAY
Zero Don’t do it

He keeps running and he doesn’t look back

Mr Sir draws his gun putting his eye up to the SCOPE
placing the CROSSHAIRS dixrectiy on Zero’s back

MR SIR
I’ve got him

WARDEN
Take him out

Me SIR
Yes sir

We see Mr Sir lock the CROSSHAIRS right between Zero’s
shoulder blades and his finger touches the TRIGGER
ready to pull

when suddenly THEO emerges from his hole like DAVID
with a LARGE ROCK and BASHES MR SIR in the back of the
head

Mr Sir falls to the ground his gun falling out of his
hands onto the dirt

Almost immediately Stanley has the gun in his hands
and he has it pointed at the WARDEN

Theo falls to his knees the tock falling from his dirt
covered hands

WARDEN
(putting his hand on his gun
holster)
Put it down

STANLEY
Don’t think I won’t kill you
The Warden flinches pulling his hand away from his
holster

STANLEY (cont’d)
(to X-Ray)
Get the keys to the truck

X-Ray pulls the keys to the truck off of Mr Sir’s belt
and jumps into the cab

X-RAY
Come on

STANLEY
Theo come with us

Theo still dazed turns his head toward Stanley

THEO
I can’t Stanley I have to stay
here God meant it to happen just this

way

Stanley slowly nods his head

Stanley backs away from the Warden the gun still aimed

at his chest He then hops into the back of the pickup
truck

STANLEY
(the gun still aimed)
I bet you wish you knew if Zero was
telling the truth
(beat)
Good luck finding it sir

X-Ray starts the engine and steps on the accelerator
sending the DODGE lurching forward in a cloud of dust

Once the truck gets up to full speed Stanley crawls
through the back window into the cab

INT DODGE PICKUP -- NEXT

Stanley adjusts himself into his seat putting his
seatbelt on

STANLEY
There he is Pull up behind him

The truck begins to slow down just as Zero can be seen

through the windshield still running as fast as he
can
Suddenly a gunshot can be heard Stanley sees that

there is now a BULLET HOLE in the windshield

93

EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE -- EAST SECTOR -- NEXT

The Warden has his gun raised and he is firing at the
truck

With all of the strength that he has left Theo lunges at
the Warden The Warden quickly rebounds and knocks Theo
to the ground

THEO
(crying)
It was supposed to happen It was
supposed to happen this way

Theo raises his hands in the air as i to beg for mercy

The Warden slowly raises his gun aiming it at Theo
and with no emotion whatsoever he pulls the trigger

INT DODGE PICKUP -- NEXT

Zero jumps into the front of the cab and X-Ray steps on
the gas sending them once again southwest at full speed

ZERO
(heavy breathing)
What the hell happened

STANLEY
Theo saved us

X-RAY
Where am I going I don’t know where
to go

ZERO
Southwest Just drive southwest toward
the border We have to go to Mexico

EXT TEXAS DESERT -- HELICOPTER SHOT
We see the TRUCK crest a small incline dust billowing
out behind it catching air on the other side

INT DODGE PICKUP -- NEXT

The three of them look out through the windshield when
suddenly the desert begins to COLLAPSE BENEATH THEM The
truck skids off toward the left into some sort of
ditch and then SMASHES INTO A CONCRETE PYLON buried in

the sand

In an instant the driver and passenger AIRBAGS deploy
in a whiplash motion their bodies thrust forward into
them
EXT TEXAS DESERT -- NEXT

Sand pours down over the truck as it is now nestled
into the ditch channel the front end completely
totaled

INT DODGE PICKUP -- NEXT

Stanley struggles to get his seatbelt off coughing from
the smoke

STANLEY

Hey is everybody alright
ZERO

I think so

But then X-Ray begins to cough up BLOOD onto his airbag

STANLEY
X-Ray are you OK

But he does not answer He only continues to cough

X-RAY
The steering wheel Hit me in the
stomach hard

STANLEY
We have to get out Come on

Stanley gets the passenger side door open and steps out
Zero pulls back X-Ray’s airbag and then reaches
around reclining X-Rays seat so that he can slip out

from behind the steering wheel

He then helps pull him free guiding him out of the
passenger side door

EXT DITCH CHANNEL -- WEXT

The truck is almost completely buried in the sand
camouflaging from view

Stanley examines the CONCRETE SLAB that they collided
with as Zero helps X-Ray lay down on the sand

ZERO
I think you might have broken a couple
of ribs Lay down and take deep
breaths

STANLEY
There’s an opening here There
something behind this pylon
We see that there is a three foot wide crack in the
CONCRETE SLAB and only darkness beyond

Stanley runs back to the REAR CAB AREA of the truck and
removes a DUFFEL BAG and FIRST AID KIT

Stanley rifles through the bag and pulls out a LARGE
HALOGEN FLASHLIGHT

He turns it on shining it into the black opening
STANLEY
Oh my God You’re not gonna believe
this
ZERO

What is it

STANLEY
It’s an underground parking garage
There must be two hundred parked cars
in there

X-Ray begins to cough more severely

STANLEY (cont’d)
Come on we have to go inside
They’1l be coming to look for us

INT UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE -- NEXT

Led by the bright FLASHLIGHT BEAM they walk into the
garage and we see dozens of PARKED CARS They are
remarkably well preserved parked uniformly in their

spots

Stanley shines his light onto an OLDSMOBILE STATION
WAGON and sees that the driver’s door is ajar and
laying next to it on the concrete is the SKELETON of the
woman who was driving it

X-RAY
Theo was right about you Stanley You
find things That’s your gift

STANLEY
Seems like almost all the cars should

be empty

Stanley shines the light across a CHEVY LUMINA a HONDA
PRELUDE and a TOYOTA COROLLA They are all empty

He then shines the light down the center aisle and he
sees two SKELETONS on the concrete next to one another
He walks over to them and sees that there is a MACY’S BAG
on the ground between them

He picks up the shopping bag and looks inside retrieving
TWO MENS SWEATSHIRTS He then finds the CREDIT CARD
RECEIPT and WALLET and he hold it up to the flashlight

The name on the drivers licence is MONA STEINER

STANLEY (cont’d)
Her name was Mona Steiner She bought
us some sweatshirts You boys want
some clean clothes

X-RAY
Hell yeah

Zero walks X-Ray over to a RANGE ROVER that is parked
next to an EMPTY SPOT

CUT TO

INT UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE —— MOMENTS LATER

Zero has found a LARGE ROCK and he uses it to smash
through one of the back windows of the RANGE ROVER in
order to get the doors unlocked

He then puts X-Ray into the passenger seat of the Rover

ZERO
Now you’re riding in style boy
X-RAY
Always wanted to ride in a Range
Rover
ZERO

We need to tape up those ribs

Stanley comes by with the sweatshirts and a second
FLASHLIGHT

STANLEY
Here’s another flashlight I emptied
out the truck It’s all buried in the
sand I don’t think anyone will see

it
ZERO
(whispering)
He’s hurt real bad I don’t know

what to do other than keep him still
tape up his ribs

Stanley looks over at X-Ray who is holding his
stomach his eyes closed

STANLEY
Listen it’s gonna get real cold in

around try and find some blankets
(setting down the duffel bag)
There’s enough food in here to last us
for a little while

ZERO
Ill watch him check through these
cars

STANLEY

I’ll meet you back here
And then Stanley walks off into the dark garage
INT UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE -- MOMENTS LATER

Stanley crosses down into the lower section of the
garage sweeping the halogen flashlight over the rows
of cars

At the end of the parking level he shines the light onto
an EXIT DOOR that reads

SEARSPARKING LEVEL 1
Stanley walks through the doorway
INT UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR -- NEXT

Stanley walks to the end of the corridor and finds
himself at the entrance to the BASEMENT LEVEL of SEARS

INT SEARS UNDERGROUND LEVEL -- NEXT

Stanley shines his light into the darkness revealing
the HOUSEWARES and FURNITURE department

The aisles covered in dirt are remarkably well
preserved Stanley passes through the ATHLETIC
DEPARTMENT sweeping the light across a row of BASEBALL
BATS and BASKETBALLS

He removes one of the basketballs from its cardboard
container and goes to dribble it on the floor When it
hits the ground it deflates with a SPLAT

Stanley moves through to the middle of the department
where there is a PAIR OF ESCALATORS rising up into the

rubble

Packed onto the escalators and covered from some of the
fallen debris from above are nearly a DOZEN SKELETONS and

their CLOTHING
Stanley then turns and shines his light into the
FURNITURE SECTION where there are FOUR COUCHES set up

as a FAUX LIVING ROOM

STANLEY
Jackpot

Age
STANLEY
Eight
The Guard moves to the side allowing Stanley through

The Woman behind him begins to scream again

INT SCHOOL GYMNASIUM -- NIGHT

Inside the Gymnasium there are dozens of COTS laid out in
rows on the floor There are sick people everywhere and
just TWO VOLUNTBER DOCTORS

cur To

INT SEARS UNDERGROUND LEVEL -- NEXT

STANLEY
We were there for maybe two days
and then her throat started to close

up
CUT TO FLASHBACK
INT SCHOOL GYMNASIUM -- NIGHT

Stanley is laying on the wood floor next to Rebecca’s
cot when he is awakened by harsh breathing sounds

He rises up to meet her face and we see that she is
desperately holding her throat

Stanley takes her hand his face filled with panic

STANLEY
Doctor We need a doctor

But no one comes

STANLEY (cont’d)
We need some medicine

WOMAN
There isn’t any There’s nothing you
can do but wait now

Stanley turns his head and sees that it is the woman who
was trying desperately to get into the gymnasium before

cUuT TO

INT SEARS UNDERGROUND LEVEL -- NEXT

STANLEY
Finally they gave her a
tracheotomy and she was breathing

through this straw
cuUT TO FLASHBACK

INT SCHOOL GYMNASIUM -- NIGHT

Rebecca is now laying there with the tracheotomy tube
sticking out of her throat Her eyes are barely open

Stanley is next to her holding her hand once again
STANLEY
It will be alright Soon everything
will be alright

CUT TO

EXT SEARS UNDERGROUND LEVEL -- NEXT

STANLEY
I sat there with her for three weeks
And each day things got a little
worse It got so she couldn’t talk
She could barely open her eyes they
were so swollen Her tear ducts were
all dried up

Tears have begun to roll down Stanley’s cheeks

STANLEY (cont’d)
You think that they’11 finally reach
this threshold Where a person
can’t suffer anymore than they already
kmow You think that when it gets so
bad the body will just surrender
and put the mind to rest put the
pain away because it’s got nothing to
do but just sit there day after day
and repeat the same thing

(beat)
But it doesn’t It just repeats
itself And repeats itself
(beat)

You can only look at someone suffering
for so long until you have to finish
what God started You have to take
responsibility and do what you think
will best provide for the person who
suffers more than you do

CUT TO FLASHBACK

INT SCHOOL GYMNASIUM -- NIGHT

Stanley is crying holding his sister’s hand He slowly
reaches his hand out and touches Rebecca’s swollen
face and then moves his hand down to her throat and
slowly removes the Tracheotomy tube

We pull back slowly from Stanley as he lowers his head to
her chest listening as the breath finally leaves her

body

CUT TO

INT SEARS UNDERGROUND LEVEL -- NEXT

STANLEY
But somebody saw me do it
(beat)
I don’t know who but somebody saw me
do it and before I kmew it they
were taking me away

CUT TO FLASHBACK

INT SCHOOL GYMNASIUM -- NIGHT

A hand grabs Stanley by the arm as he sits over Rebecca’s
body pulling him up to his feet

Her HAND falls from his limp now touching the floor

curt TO

INT SEARS UNDERGROUND LEVEL -- NEXT

Stanley looks up from the Trivial Pursuit card in his
hand He has not stopped crying

STANLEY
I guess they figured I was valuable
Young healthy man
(beat)
So that’s why I killed my sister

They are all silent for a moment X-Ray has grown very
weak

X-RAY

(almost gone)
You don’t have to worry Stanley I’ll
tell Rebecca that you said hi

(beat)
I’m not cold I’m not cold anymore

(beat)
You see I’m lucky compared to her I
got Mona Steiner’s sweatshirt on She

bought this one special for me so
I’d been nice and warm

(beat)
You see I got X-Ray vision I can

see through space and time I can see
her right now

We pull back to a wide angle of the sporting goods
department and ESCALATORS and they SLOWLY MORPH BACK
IN TIME where the store is now bathed in light with

shoppers everywhere

X-Ray Stanley and Zero watch from the Faux Living Room
as MONA STEINER and her sister another plump older
woman come down the escalator carrying the MACY’S
SHOPPING BAG deep in conversation

X-RAY (cont’d)
I can hear them talking She bought it
for her son To keep him warm She’s
glad that it got put to good use

Mona Steiner slowly turns her head and GAZES OVER AT THEM
WITH A SMILE

When she and her sister reach the bottom they turn and
walk through the Sporting Goods Department toward the
exit

X-RAY (cont‘d)
You were my friends
(beat)
You were my best friends

They watch her silently from the future with a sense of
longing for the past that has been lost

EXT TEXAS DESERT -- SUNSET

Stanley and Zero stand over X-Ray’s GRAVE which they
have just filled back up adjacent to the ditch channel

ZERO
That’s the last hole I’m ever going to
dig Stanley

STANLEY
Me too
(beat)
Never again

With the duffel bag flashlights and the gun in hand
Stanley and Zero begin to walk east in the direction from
which they came the sky slowly turning from purple
into black

NARRATOR
Stanley and I walked back toward camp
green lake knowing that the only
logical solution was to finish what we
started and then depending on
the direction of fate either suffer
or benefit from the consequences

EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE -- SOUTHWEST SECTOR -- NIGHT

Stanley and Zero maneuver through the darkness between
the sea of holes Beyond them the lights from the camp
can be seen in the distance

NARRATOR
It was a fact known by everyone at
Camp Green Lake that Stanley had a
Imack for finding things

Stanley and Zero look down at the hole that is the
epicenter of their destination

The letters and numbers stare back at them from the sand
SOL 112

They jump down into the hole and begin to DIG INTO THE
SOIL WITH THEIR BARE HANDS

They dig for a minute or s0 until Stanley’s hands brush
against something
STANLEY
(whispering)
I feel metal

They dig around the outline of what appears to be a
RECTANGULAR METAL BOX

The LATCH is undone

ZERO
The latch is undone

STANLEY
We have to open it

They stare silently down at the box

ZERO
Are you scared Stanley

STANLEY
No We’ve got nothing to be scared of

After a moment’s hesitation Stanley leans down and opens
the lid to the box

He then steps back and they stare blankly down at its
contents

They stare for a long time saying nothing

ZERO
What do you think it is

Stanley looks closer

STANLEY
(long beat)
It looks like a housing A housing for
what we found before
(beat)
And there are twenty-three more of

them
We finally see that inside the box is this

There is an INTRICATE METAL HOUSING with twenty three of
the SPARK PLUG HAMMERS plugged into it on FOUR PARALLEL
ROWS In the upper left corner one of the SPARK PLUG

HAMMERS is missing

ZERO
Do you think it’s a weapon

STANLEY
I think that it’s twenty-three loaded
weapons This thing ejects them
once they’ve been used up

(beat)
I think the first one started all
of this Started the war

(long beat)
Right now I wish that I had a Trivial
Pursuit card that could tell me all of

the answers

Suddenly footsteps can be heard from above Stanley
and Zero turn quickly away Zero reaches for the gun
that sits in the corner of the hole

VOICE
Don’t move

The voice belongs to Mr Sir He has his gun aimed down
at them

MR SIR
Get out of the hole Right now

Stanley and Zero slowly make their way to the surface
Once they are up they see that the Warden is waiting

for them

The Warden assesses the two young men for a long
moment and then slowly approaches them
TA

WARDEN
Thank you for serving your country
(beat)
May God have mercy on your souls

From behind the Warden TWO HEADLIGHTS approach from the
distance

The Warden then without a trace of emotion nods his
head to Mr Sir

Stanley and Zero glance quickly back at one another
knowing that this is it

Mr Six then raises his PISTOL to Zero his finger on
the trigger

WHEN SUDDENLY THERE IS A LOUD ELECTRICAL SNAPPING
SOUND MR SIR’S HEAD FLINCHES SLIGHTLY HIS EYES
SUDDENLY FILLED WITH HORROP JUST BEFORE HE FALLS DOWN
FACE FIRST ONTO THE GROUND

Stanley and Zero look down in shock at the back of Mr
Sir’s head and see the BLADE OF ONE OF THE SPARKPLUG
HAMMERS IS IMBEDDED IN THE BACK OF HIS SKULL

Silence

The lights from the approaching truck are now getting
closer

The Warden slowly turns his head toward the hole and
before he has had the chance to reach for his gun

THERE IS ANOTHER ELECTRICAL SNAPPING SOUND AND

ANOTHER SPARKPLUG HAMMER EJECTS FROM THE HOLE TURNING
END OVER END UNTIL IT IMBEDS ITSELF INTO THE WARDEN’S

CHEST

The Warden falls to the ground holding onto the device
buried deep within his chest cavity

BLOOD GUSHES FROM HIS MOUTH
Stanley slowly approaches the Warden like a cat
The headlights from the truck grow closer
Stanley leans down to the Warden taking his hand
The Warden’s eyes are filled with nothing but terror
STANLEY
(whispering)

May God forgive you for the suffering
that you have caused
ps

The Warden’s eyes widen

We approach Zero who looks just as terrified as the
Warden staring down into the hole with tears in his
eyes

NARRATOR

In that moment I realized the great
interlocking connection that had been
made by this thing buried beneath
me

the one who was good at finding

revisited from the future back into

again Buried beneath my feet in this
strange connection

Stanley holds the Wardens hand as the life passes from
him the light from the approaching truck bathing them

in a white glow

As the MILITARY TRUCK comes to a stop Stanley and Zero
look up and see that it is PENDANSKI who steps out

He is now wearing a military uniform his head shaved
into a crew cut

He approaches them slowly assessing the scene Judging
the aftermath Deciding what to do next is the thing that
they have been doing for so long

PENDANSEKI
Start digging There isn’t much time

cur TO
EXT CAMP GREEN LAKE -- SOUTHWEST SECTOR -- NIGHT

Stanley Zero and Pendanski stand over the filled holes
where the Warden and Mr Sir now rest

From SOL 112 they then retrieve the Metal Box containing
the remaining 21 sparkplug hammers and they place it
carefully into the back of the Military Truck

Pendanski then grabs a stack of FATIGUES and throws
them at Stanley and Zero

PENDANSEI
Put these on You’ve been drafted

INT MILITARY TRUCK -- NEXT

Stanley and Zero sit in the cab of the truck as Pendanski
drives

They drive back through the camp for the last time
ignored entirely by the scores of military personnel
moving throughout They approach the entrance where the
arched sign stares back at them

WELCOME TO CAMP GREEN LAKE

As they pull up to a stop there is an ARMED MILITARY
GUARD standing there

Stanley looks over and sees that the Guard is actually
DEREK His hair has also been shaved into a crew cut

PENDANSKI
(to Derek)
Laundry duty

Derek looks briefly over at Stanley and Zero nods his
head and then waves them through

The Truck then drives off into the desert night
leaving the camp behind forever with its precious
cargo in tow

CUT TO
EXT OCEAN -- DAY

We pull back from ocean waves into the WAKE of a LARGE
CIVILIAN TRANSPORT SHIP

EXT TRANSPORT SHIP -- NEXT

Stanley Zero and Pendanski emerge from a group of
people on the REAR DECK of the ship They are dressed
like civilians in WINTER PATAGONIAS

As we get closer we see that Stanley and Zero are
carrying both ends of a HUGE BLUE DUFFEL BAG

As they carry it to the edge of the railing that

overlooks the back of the transport ship they pause
for a moment resting the duffel bag on the back of the
railing
Pendanski stands behind them looking down at the wake
forming in the water
PENDANSKI
Whatever it is it did what it did
for a reason
(beat)
And now it wants to be buried
(beat)
Or it wouldn’t have let us come this

far
Stanley and Zero look at one another

ZERO
Bury the past

Stanley nods in agreement

STANLEY
Bury the past

And with that they tip the duffel bag over the
railing and it PLUNGES INTO THE OCEAN

They stare back for a moment and Stanley’s eyes widen
suddenly his face filled with some wondrous

realization

NARRATOR

And then we were filled with a great
and strange wisdom We went to a place
where we could bury our regret That
same regret that had imbedded itself
without choice in the hearts of those
who were no longer around to show us
the way With this knowledge we sailed
forth on a new path through the
architechture of this immense planet
its mysteries still unsolved

(beat)
And we haven’t looked back since

And with that the ship trails away from us gaining
speed into the horizon

FADE OUT
