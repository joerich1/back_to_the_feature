Julian watches transfixed

Liang is lit up by a beatific white light As he stands
in the middle of the ring the crowd start to gather round

Behind him Gordon his phone glued to his face
On the other side of the road is Choi Yan Lees Kiosk big

to double as his home currently manned by his long
wife Kim Yan Lee She serves a chilled coconut to a man As
turns round we reveal hes a particularly murderous

member of Julians crew - Ko Sam
We pick out Charlie Ling a little further down the road

looking at a tray of battery powered robots that some Street

selling
Theyre all counting down the minutes Biding their time

for Choi Yan Lee to turn up

Finally the sound of the Tuck-tuck approaching

Ko Sam drinks his coconut down in one - slurping as he hits
bottom Letting the empty shell fall to the floor

Charlie Ling stands up Feels the gun under his jacket

The Tuck-tuck pulls up and Choi Yan Lees Daughters help him

the kiosk that doubles as their home
Julian and his men close in

JULIAN
Ask him if hes Choi Yan Lee
At the mention of his name the colour drains from Choi Yan
Lees

face His eyes lock with Julians
CHARLIE LING

gun
Aims it at Choi Yan Lees face
CHOI YAN LEE
(IN THAT)
Oh God Please dont kill me Please

Gordon laughs but Julian listens with great interest

JULIAN
How does he do that

CHARLIE LING

Ask him who cut his hand off
Charlie Lings reluctant to question him further Julian
