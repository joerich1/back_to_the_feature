FADE IN

THE DARK OF NIGHT

Stars Everywhere We can’t tell Heaven from Earth

Tiny pinpricks of light shimmer flicker They begin arcing
-- bearing downward like shooting stars But theyre not
stars theyre FIREBALLS Hurling towards --

EXT ACRE - NIGHT

A heavily fortified port city located on Haifa Bay

Acre is the last remaining Christian stronghold in the Holy
Land A vast network of walls towers and breakwaters

And she’s under siege

WHAM Fireballs rain down slamming into Acres defensive
outer walls Explosions of FLAMES A relentless blistering
bombardment Two of her mighty defense towers lie in ruins
The once great city is hanging by a thread

Super Acre 28 May 1291

A solitary RIDER gallops across the desert A MESSENGER

As he rides towards Acre we see fireballs streaking
overhead illuminating the night sky The massive GATES
open granting him entry then quickly close behind him
WITHIN THE CITY WALLS

CRUSADER KNIGHTS hold the line -- dodging the onslaught of
fireballs The remaining walls and gates are propped up by
balks of timber Weakened from weeks of constant attack
Our Messenger rides through streets littered with the

dead the wounded the dying Looters scrounge amongst

the rubble The Messenger dismounts rushes towards

THE TEMPLAR CASTLE The last remaining structure in Acre
A massive fortress overlooking the sea shore Waves crash
against the TOWERS emblazoned with hammered bronze LIONS
INT TEMPLAR CASTLE - NIGHT

WOMEN and CHILDREN huddle together in the darkness
Frightened faces stained amber in the candlelight The last

survivors of Acre all under the protection of the Templars

Muted blasts echo The castle rumbles
INT TEMPLAR CASTLE CHAPEL - NIGHT

At the ALTAR -- KNIGHTS kneel in prayer receiving the Holy
Sacrament from a PRIEST We see RED CROSSES emblazoned
across their white mantles These are the KNIGHTS TEMPLAR

The Templars remain stoic choking back their emotions
Many know this will be their last Sacrament

The Priest holds a CHALICE speaks barely above a whisper

PRIEST
(in Latin)
-- the blood of Christ --

As each Knight leans forward to sip from the chalice his
face is illuminated by the flickering candlelight --

PETER OF SEVREY (40s) Marshall of the Knights Templar
Strong Fair Moral

JACQUES DE MOLAY The elder statesman An elegant
respected Knight Flowing white hair and beard And --

HUGH OF PAYNES aka HUGH THE HAND (20s) Intense eyes
Youthful Rugged Loyal And our hero

The Knights turn to each other embracing speaking in
Latin “May the Lord be with you” “ And with you”

The MESSENGER enters bows before Peter then hands him a
SCROLLED PARCHMENT Peter unfurls it reads

PETER OF SEVREY
The Sultan wishes to negotiate A
peace delegation awaits us at dawn

JACQUES
Negotiate
(re explosions)
Doesnt sound like it to me

HUGH
My lord Allow me to accompany you --

PETER OF SEVREY
I need your strength here to ensure
the safety of the innocent
(off Hughs disappointed
look)
Have faith brother Now arrange my
escort We leave at first light
INT TEMPLAR CASTLE PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

As Hugh walks A SHADOW follows him An assassin Hugh

senses it -- spins around grabbing someone Torchlight

reveals a beautiful woman (20s) This is MARCELA
HUGH

Marcela Why are you still here
You were to have left the city --

MARCELA
And go where Our children are
gone Dead Without you Im
alone How can I leave
(tearing up)
I love you

She goes to kiss him their lips touch Hugh gently breaks
it He takes her in his arms holding her tight

HUGH
There’s nothing else I want more
But it is forbidden My pledge my
oath to God

His heart is breaking Its killing him

MARCELA
Is it your oath to God Is that
why you remain here and fight Or
is it still for those long since
dead
(a beat)

What about me God would want us
to be together As would you

She touches a NECKLACE he wears around his neck TWO GOLD
WEDDING BANDS hang from the simple silver chain

MARCELA
Let us leave here while we still can

HUGH
I love you I always will But you
know I cannot do that
He kisses her on the forehead
HUGH
Stay here in the temple Youll be

safe I will come back for you

-- and is gone
SOMEONE WATCHES FROM THE SHADOWS

ALEXIUS OF THURINGIA (20s) Charismatic Strong
Germanic good looks Alexius is a TEUTONIC KNIGHT

(Note Teutonic Knights dress just like the Templars but
a BLACK CROSS replaces the Templars’ RED CROSS)

As Marcela walks away drying her eyes he follows
ALEXIUS

Strange way to show someone love
Choosing God over them

MARCELA
He is an honorable man He has
suffered greatly and sacrificed

more than you know
ALEXIUS
Indeed But what about you He
has chosen his path in life what
of yours
Marcela looks away She has no answer It hurts
ALEXIUS
Come with me Tonight I can get us
both to safety We can be together
Ill give you everything you desire
She looks down silent

An uneasy beat Alexius smiles swallowing his pride He
then leans in and kisses her on the cheek

ALEXIUS
Another life perhaps

DISSOLVE TO
EXT ACRE — DAWN

Sun creeping over the bone-white desert horizon revealing
the true extent of the damage to Acre

VARIOUS QUICK SHOTS - THE KNIGHTS TEMPLAR

Templars preparing for battle suiting up arming themselves
DRAPERS and SQUIRES saddling up Templar warhorses

These warrior monks are the Green Berets of the Middle Ages

EXT COURTYARD - DAWN

All is quiet We find PETER and HUGH with representatives
of the other two great Military Orders THE HOSPITALLERS and
TEUTONIC KNIGHTS The escort stands ready

ALEXIUS looks on with VISAGO OF TISZA A towering muscular
Crusader veteran Alexius sergeant and close friend

Peter secretly hands Hugh a KEY Hugh is taken aback

PETER OF SEVREY
These walls won’t hold them back
for long should negotiations fail
The Orders survival depends on it
They exchange a silent look Hugh nods He understands
CHURCH BELLS RING giving the all clear
PETER OF SEVREY
Lower the flag Open the gates
(crosses himself)
God be with us all
Crusaders jump into action carrying out his orders
THE BEAUSEANT (the Templar black and white banner) lowers
THE GATES OF ST ANTHONY slowly open revealing
THE MAMELUK ARMY

A fierce Muslim fighting force 200000 strong Infantry
Calvary Archers Dozens of large MANGONELS (catapults)

and SIEGE ENGINES All regiments holding in temporary truce
Peter and his escort ride out across the battlefield towards
A PARLEY TENT The grotesque landscape is littered with
DEAD BODIES Buzzards feast on the decomposing corpses
Tension is thick

MUSLIM ROYAL GUARDS show Peter and his men into the tent
EXT TEMPLAR CASTLE ROOFTOP - LATER

Jacques stands looking out over the battlefield He seems
lost His eyes looking beyond Hugh approaches Jacques

HUGH
So what do you see
JACQUES
(a sad laugh)
The end
Hugh sees the sea of Mameluk soldiers Insurmountable odds

HUGH
I fear we will forever have the
shame of defeat

JACQUES

There is no shame in our defeat

We did our duty We saved lives

We defended God’s land We spilled

blood in the name of Christendom

In our defeat there is only glory
Suddenly we hear VOICES shouting in the distance
Hugh raises a medieval TELESCOPE to his eye

TELESCOPE POV Something on the horizon distorted by the
rippling heat haze The wavering image comes into focus

A HORSE Galloping across the battlefield towards Acre
And hanging around the steeds neck like a wreath are

THE SEVERED HEADS OF PETER OF SEVREY AND HIS ESCORT
And thundering up behind the horse -- THE MAMELUK ARMY
Horrified Hugh lowers the scope shouting --

HUGH
Raise the flag Evacuate the city

MAMELUK DRUMMERS riding camels bang away on kettledrums
An unnerving thunderous war cry

Mameluks fire their CATAPULTS -- unleashing a lethal barrage

of rocks pots of Greek fire and severed heads

CRUSADER KNIGHTS take cover as heavy ordinance rains down
Sprays of stone and roaring fireballs pummel the city A
SEVERED HEAD slams a Crusader Knight to the ground

Mameluks roll their mighty SIEGE TOWERS and LADDERS up
against the city’s walls Muslim foot soldiers charge --
climbing -- rushing to engage the Christian forces

CRUSADER ARCHERS AND CROSSBOWMEN repel the infidel invaders
Crusader FIRE ARROWS strike a SIEGE TOWER -- igniting it
Fiery beams fall collapsing on top of the tightly packed
Mameluk infantry below Men burn

It looks like the Heavens opened up and Hell rained down
CUT TO

JACQUES and HUGH atop their WARHORSES both man and horse
dressed in full regalia Hugh unsheathes his sword

HUGH
Brothers Let us kill the enemy or
die for you need not be afraid
We are soldiers of Christ We have
sworn to defend this city It is
our duty to God Are you ready

A RALLYING CRY AYE Templars raising their swords high

CUT TO
THE GATES OF ST ANTHONY swing open The TEMPLARS charge
Horses galloping -- full force -- riding “knee-to-knee”
This is an unstoppable impenetrable tight formation
Stones and fire pots EXPLODE all around But the Templars
don’t flinch They’re on a mission MAMELUKS stand ready
Ground RUMBLING beneath their feet as --

WHAM The Templars plow straight into the Muslim army

Templars battle Muslims Fierce Unrelenting Nothing
but a whirling blur of dust blood metal And death

Swords spears axes and maces smashing slicing gutting
men left and right Heads roll Limbs lopped Destriers
kicking biting It’s a bloodbath

We find HUGH -- wielding two swords -- cutting down Mameluks
at will Unbelievable skill Brutal Poetic This is why
they call him “HUGH THE HAND”

Hugh fights along side JACQUES The old man holds his own

Mameluks converge on THE GATES OF ST NICHOLAS Mangonels
fire -- a heavy hail of block-busting stones rain down

The concentrated catapult fire PUNCHES A HOLE through the
weakened gates Timber splinters Then stone by stone
the surrounding walls COLLAPSE And men are buried alive

A breach has been made
Thousands of frenzied Mameluks charge --

HUGH
Fall back Everyone fall back

He and his fellow Templars haul ass back towards Acre
INSIDE THE CITY WALLS

Mameluks flood into Acre -- easily and quickly overrunning
the overwhelmed Crusader defenses

TEMPLARS storm in on horseback -- cutting down Mameluks --
trying to plug up the damn and regain control

JACQUES is quickly outnumbered Four on one Not good

Suddenly -- POW A TEMPLAR WARHORSE kicks a Mameluk --
hoof to head -- sending him flying One down

Hugh dismounts flips a switch on his SHIELD A lethal
SERRATED RAZOR RING springs out around the edges

He whirls his shield around like a SPINNING BUZZ SAW --
quickly dispatching the others Jacques nods thanks

The three military orders fight together -- but theyre
seriously outnumbered Rocks and Greek fire still rain down

JACQUES
Evacuate the temple Get everyone
to the ships Our only hope is to
reach the King’s fleet

As the Crusaders fall back we see ALEXIUS and VISAGO stand
their ground -- killing MAMELUKS -- clearing a path for
ACRES CITIZENS as they pour into the TEMPLAR CASTLE

HUGH fights along side OLIVER OF SAUNFORDE(late 40’s) A
grizzled bear-like Templar He’s wickedly quick Strong

INT TEMPLAR CASTLE - SAME

As MARCELA helps escort people inside she sees HUGH --
fighting off MAMELUKS She grabs a LIT TORCH and --

EXT TEMPLAR CASTLE - SAME
-- runs through the chaos She stabs TWO MAMELUKS with

her torch LIGHTING THEM ON FIRE Hugh grabs Marcela --
wants to hug her but --
HUGH
Back inside Im right behind you

She nods then runs back towards the castle
Suddenly catapult fire sails overheard -- HAMMERING the
castle Deafening explosions A castle wall crumbles

THE TEMPLAR CASTLE IS STARTING TO COLLAPSE

Hugh and Alexius both watch in horror as

Rocks and rubble rain down burying MARCELA

HUGH
No

Hugh runs towards her -- starts digging -- pushing away
heavy rubble He can see her but shes just out of reach

ALEXIUS joins him and together they feverishly dig oblivious
to the battle raging around them As they continue digging
more of Marcela’s body is exposed her face Arms Chest

Hugh tries to pull her body out Can’t Everything below
her waist is still trapped under heavy rubble JACQUES and
OLIVER rush up pulling Hugh away --

JACQUES
We have to go Now
HUGH
No
Hugh shakes them off -- runs back to Marcela Looks into
her eyes they are lifeless Vacant Desperately tries

moving the heavier blocks of rubble that trap her Oliver
pulls him back again harder

OLIVER
Hugh She’s gone Let her go

Hugh still struggles like a caged animal

JACQUES
That’s an order

Hugh kneels there for a moment numb Then snaps to --
momentarily burying his feelings his loss

He holds up the KEY Peter gave him now stained with blood

Jacques nods quickly rounding up Templars

JACQUES
To the vaults Gather everything
you can

Hugh gives Marcelas lifeless body one final look A beat
He crosses himself And then leaves

ALEXIUS remains silent devastated He too stares at her
He watches HUGH running into the temple --

EXT ACRE HARBOR - DAY

A mass exodus The defenders and noncombatants of Acre flee
We see dozens of docked TEMPLAR VENETIAN AND CYPRIOT SHIPS

Civilians rush towards the galleys Panicked Scared

WEALTHY CITIZENS beg SOLDIERS AND SAILORS -- offering their
valuables their bodies -- anything -- for safe passage

INT TEMPLAR CASTLE SECRET TUNNELS - DAY

TEMPLARS escort women and children down the subterranean
tunnels Bright daylight up ahead in the distance

HUGH leads Templars down a dimly lit tunnel Walls rumble
as the battle rages above Torches flicker They enter --

INT VAULT —- DAY

An underground vault Filled with priceless TREASURE
Gold silver jewels relics holy artifacts

As Templars get busy -- Hugh rushes to the back of the room
-- towards an IRON GATE He unlocks it -- pushes forward --
hurries down another narrow tunnel towards a small ALCOVE

Sitting amongst broken pottery -- AN OBJECT wrapped in
cloth He unwraps it revealing abejeweled BRONZED CROSS

INT SECRET TUNNELS - SAME

ALEXIUS maneuvers through the throngs of evacuees -- he
sees TEMPLARS exiting a side passage carrying TREASURE

INT VAULT - DAY
Hugh pulls out the KEY He looks the cross over -- finds
a large RED RUBY Hugh then removes the precious stone

Underneath it -- A KEYHOLE

Hugh inserts the key turns -- CLICK A panel springs open
revealing a secret compartment Hugh pulls out --

A small tarnished SILVER BOX with the inscribed SEAL of

the Templars Two Knights riding a single horse It looks
worthless But whatever it contains makes Hugh nervous

Then it hits him -- all at once Tears welling up in his
eyes A moment Explosions echo The room rumbles dust
rains down Hugh turns to leave bumping into ALEXIUS

He sees the SILVER BOX in Hughs hand His eyes light up

ALEXIUS
It does exist The Holy Grail is
the source of life We can save her

Hugh is caught by Alexius’ suggestion A beat He looks
down at the silver box in his hands Anger Sorrow Torn

HUGH
I I can’t Thats blasphemy

ALEXIUS
You choose dogma over love What
kind of man are you If you truly
loved her you would do anything to
save her

Explosions rumble again Louder Getting closer

HUGH
We have to go Theres nothing we
can do Shes dead You must --

ALEXIUS
(unsheathes his SWORD)
Give it to me -- now

HUGH
The Grail is not intended for mortal
men The mysteries of life and death
are for God alone Only the worthy --

Alexius attacks Hugh -- right there with him -- sword
drawn defensive position The two warriors engage Swords
clanging Blocking each blow Both extremely well-trained

But Alexius overpowers Hugh -- pulls out a DAGGER -- and
STABS Hugh up under his armor Hugh collapses dropping the
SILVER BOX

Alexius grabs it tucks it away

ALEXIUS
Im sorry but I love her

As he exits Hugh grabs his sword -- and throws it THUNK
The blade pierces the stone wall just missing Alexius’ face

HUGH
(seething in pain)
No matter what you do She will
never love you In this life or
the next

Enraged Alexius pulls Hugh’s sword from the wall -- then
lays into him with a furious two sword attack

Hugh throws anything and everything he can to block Alexius
ferocious attacks -- Ceramic pots goblets --

Alexius thrusts his sword -- Hugh uses a GOLD PLATTER as a
makeshift shield The blade SKEWERS it Stuck Hugh kicks
Alexius knocking him backwards --

Hugh rolls grabbing a BULLWHIP from his side -- A RAZOR
SCYTHE attached to the end of it -- A WHIPSCYTHE

He lashes out -- CRACK-CRACK-CRACK Alexius blocks the
blows with his other sword Sparks FLASH The whipscythe
blade SEVERS Alexius sword in half

Hugh lassos Alexius around his midsection -- the whipscythe
blade CUTTING through Alexius armor gouging his stomach

A fatal blow Blood spews

As Alexius falls he slices the BULLWHIP with his broken
sword Alexius pulls the whipsycthe blade out of his gut
He shivers in pain shock kicking in Life draining

Hugh drops the whip -- and pulls his own DAGGER -- ready to
deliver the death blow As he brings the blade down --

ALEXIUS BLOCKS IT ON THE DOWNSWING
Hugh tries forcing the dagger down -- Alexius using all his
strength pushes back The daggers razor tip hovering just

centimeters over Alexius EYE

HUGH
Give me the Grail

EXT BATTLEFIELD — SAME

Mameluk catapults fire upon the TEMPLAR CASTLE Clusters of
boulders slam into a TOWER Direct hit The tower PANCAKES
in on itself -- COLLAPSING into dust and rubble and --

INT VAULT —- SAME

The walls SHAKE violently CHUNKS OF STONE fall -- smashing
Hugh Alexius kicks him off -- rolling away -- just as --

THE CEILING CAVES IN SPLITTING THE ROOM IN TWO

Our two warriors buried under rubble As the dust settles
JACQUES enters finds only HUGH Out cold but alive

EXT ACRE HARBOR - DAY

GALLEYS ablaze under the barrage of Mameluk fire arrows
Another CAPSIZES due to being overloaded with passengers
Hurling rocks splash down People screaming drowning

JACQUES exits the tunnel carrying Hugh on his back

He grabs a brilliant BLACK HORSE jumps on and makes a mad
dash for a Templar galley -- THE FALCON We see the

galley’s figurehead is a falcon hence the name of the ship

And behind the wheel -- ROGER LE FLOR (20s) Captain of
this vessel and the entire Templar Fleet

ROGER
Cast off Quickly

Templars KICK OFF THE GANGPLANKS But as they reach to untie
the moorings -- MAMELUK ARROWS whizz by peppering the ship

With a fierce “YAHH” Jacques snaps the reigns and the horse
leaps from the dock onto the ship’s deck

THE FALCON tugs at its mooring Wood creaking straining
MAMELUKS rush the vessel Templars fending them off ONE
MAMELUK climbs along the MOORING ROPES hand-over-hand --
OLIVER throws a HATCHET It hurls through the air --
SEVERING the rope and THE MAMELUKS HAND Stump spurting
blood he falls screaming into the water

THE FALCON breaks free and sails out into open ocean
JACQUES looks back at Acre sees the BEAUSEANT It falls

We hear Muslims rejoice Victory

INT VAULT - LATER THAT DAY

All is still Then sudden movement ALEXIUS caked in dust
and blood struggles as he crawls his way out of the debris

He collapses face to face with a broken stone statue of
CHRIST ON THE CROSS Too weak to go on He knows hes
dying We see rage hatred desperation burning inside of
him His watering eyes filled with venom

ALEXIUS
(looking at the statue)
How many lives must be lost to
honor Your name How many

Hands shaking he pulls out the SILVER BOX Dented but
still intact He opens it and removes

A tiny VIAL

Made of glass and alabaster Laced with stamped silver
And filled with red liquid -- BLOOD

He holds it up to the faint light staring in awe
Then with his last breath -- he raises the vial to his
lips smiles Toasts the statue

ALEXIUS
The blood of Christ

--and drinks it
Alexius licks his lips savoring it Fuck you
With that Alexius collapses
DISSOLVE TO
INT VAULT - LATER
Dark silent We hear FOOTSTEPS approaching
TEUTONIC KNIGHTS appear lit torches and bloodied swords
in hand And leading the charge is VISAGO As they sweep

the room scrounging up treasure Visago finds ALEXIUS

VISAGO
My lord Youre alive

We realize something is different with Alexius A FAINT GLOW
to his eyes His pupils wolf-like

ALEXIUS
Take me back up to the surface

One of the Knights notices Alexius severe wounds

TEUTONIC KNIGHT
Forget him Hes good as dead

Alexius grabs Visago hard For a dying man hes strong

ALEXIUS
Take me out of here

VISAGO
We must hurry The infidels
control the city

EXT ACRE TEMPLAR CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER

Rubble Ruins Smoke plumes We see ARAB SLAVES tossing
DEAD BODIES INTO HAND CARTS hauling them away Morbid

ARABIAN WOLVES -- mangy scary-looking -- skulk around
feasting on the dead Suddenly they look up as --

VISAGO emerges from the temple Alexius draped over his
shoulders Alexius winces in the sunlight Visago has his
sword drawn looking out for Mameluks

ALEXIUS
Visago the sun hurts my eyes

Visago covers Alexius with his surcoat As they hurry
towards where Marcela lies buried nearby HORSES freak
bucking wildly Camels groan Sensing evil Spooked

Alexius sifts through the rubble sunlight burning his bare

skin -- now RED like a bad sunburn Fighting through pain
he pulls out MARCELA Her body broken bloodied
ALEXIUS

(tearing up)
No no no Marcela

He puts his head on her chest listening praying for a
heartbeat There is the faintest sign of life

Visago unsheathes a dagger places the blade underneath her
nostrils No breathing Nothing Visago shakes his head
Enraged Alexius pushes Visago pulling her body into his

ALEXIUS
Shes still alive We must take
her with us

VISAGO
We cannot We must leave now and
head north Before its too late

Alexius weeps A man who’s soul has just been torn out
He kisses her His bloody lips on hers

Visago drags Alexius away Marcelas body falls back to
the ground Alexius looks back one last time to see --

ARAB SLAVES picking up her corpse and unceremoniously dumping
it into a cart Dead bodies are piled on top burying her

DISSOLVE TO
INT TEMPLAR GALLEY —- DAY

Hugh wakes lying in hay bathed in slatted daylight
Rocking gently Gathering himself together he sees --

THE BLACK HORSE It nudges him Theyre both safe

Hugh is surrounded by the wounded the dying Refugees
Faces saddened emotionally drained Uncertain futures

EXT TEMPLAR GALLEY MAIN DECK - MOMENTS LATER
Open ocean Roger at the wheel Hugh appears topside

As Hugh limps across the deck he sees OLIVER tending to
the wounded He is a TEMPLAR DOCTOR as well as a soldier
MONKS bless the dead then dump their bodies overboard

Hugh finds Jacques staring out across the ocean Hugh
approaches him sad Ashamed Wants to come clean

HUGH
Alexius took the Grail he died in
the temple’s collapse The Grail
is lost I lost it Forgive me

JACQUES
There was nothing you could have
done brother However all is not
lost with the Grail That is why we
have three vials The Holy Trinity
The blood of our saviour remains so
Christ will walk among us again

He lays a comforting hand on Hugh’s shoulder
JACQUES
And I am sorry for your loss She
is with God now Take heart that
many survived thanks to you

Hugh nods OLIVER approaches

OLIVER
Life is for the living my friend
‘Tis part of God’s grand plan for
us all

Oliver pulls a metal flask His ruddy features suggest some
good living and that he’s bent the strict rules of being a
Templar more than a few times Hugh eyes the flask

OLIVER
Medical spirits But not for you
(takes a pull)
Now lets go help those with real
injuries eh

DISSOLVE TO
EXT DESERT OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF ACRE - DUSK

We see DEAD BODIES being set ablaze one pile after another
Flames spiraling up into the purple skies Funeral pyres

ON A PILE OF BODIES

Sudden movement Something clawing pushing its way out
from underneath the dead bodies Fingers then a HAND

EXT DESERT - NIGHT

A dark cloudless night Sweeping desert winds

A small camp in the middle of nowhere GUARDS on lookout
INT TENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

Alexius lays in a cold sweat Visago tends to him An
ARAB SLAVE enters jug of water in hand He can’t even
look at Alexius And hurries away

ALEXIUS
Why do they fear me

VISAGO

They fear you because a man with
your wounds should have died And
yet you still live

(a beat)
They call you Ubir

(off Alexius)
It means witch

ALEXIUS
You fear me as well don’t you

Visago doesn’t answer He leaves in silence

A beat Alexius picks up a DAGGER lying by his bedside He
stares contemplating Then something catches his eye

IN THE BLADE’S REFLECTION -- Alexius’s face It’s soft out
of focus As if FADING But everything else looks normal

He gently touches his face scared What is happening to me
Off Alexius we

A LONE FIGURE silhouetted in moonlight walks slowly
across the dunes Robes BILLOWING in the howling wind

INT TENT - NIGHT

Dark except for a single candle A sudden gust of wind
The flame flutters then dies

Alexius awakens sensing something A presence He sees a
SHADOW against the tent Someone standing right outside

Wincing in discomfort Alexius rises grabs a dagger pulls
aside the entrance flap revealing

Without blemish But she also looks pale eyes vacant

Alexius stares lowering the dagger He reaches out

Super 16 years later
EXT FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

The Languedoc-Roussillon region of France Lush countryside
dotted with grazing sheep and cows surrounds a SMALL VILLAGE

Super Montsegur Southern France 1307

IN THE VILLAGE -- We see TEMPLARS feeding peasants -- healing
the sick -- building a chapel -- doing BANKING

IN A VINEYARD -- Templars and local Villagers work side by
side picking grapes They look up as a RIDING PARTY gallops
past The riders are TEMPLAR KNIGHTS

They ride towards CASTLE MONTSEGUR A massive Templar castle
at the base of the Pyrenees mountains

EXT CASTLE MONTSEGUR COURTYARD - DAY

The riding party dismounts We recognize one rider as the
Templar Captain ROGER LE FLOR (now 30’s) And

JACQUES DE MOLAY (Now in his 60s) Looking older wiser
And the current Grand Master Everyone bows with respect

He looks around sees Templars training Swords clanging
But he doesnt find who hes looking for

JACQUES
Where is Master Hugh de Payes

EXT COTTAGE - DAY

We find HUGH repairing a ROOF Hammering nails Sweating
in the sun He too looks older wiser bearded Zen-like

As Hugh steps down the ladder his squire ELYAS DALBON lugs over a pail of water Hugh takes a drink

Suddenly Elyas bows Hugh turns around sees JACQUES
standing there smiling Hugh bows Respect

HUGH
Master ‘Tis good to see you

They hug Its been a long time

JACQUES
It is good to be back home

HUGH
What brings you to Montsegur

JACQUES
Crusade

Hughs eyes ruffle Jacques motions Walk with me
JACQUES

The Pope believes we can take back
the Holy Land As do I

HUGH
The Crusades were nothing more than
a long act of intolerance in the
name of God -- a sin in itself

JACQUES
Perhaps But we are a standing
army without a battlefield And
the fact remains that Jerusalem
still lies under Muslim control
That does not sit well with Rome

HUGH
If it bothers them so then let
them fight for it --
(catches himself)
Forgive me but there will never
be peace

JACQUES
(nods then smiles)

One day I hope Nonetheless King
Philip has sent for me at the behest
of Pope Clement We are to assemble
in Paris the first of October They
both grow concerned of uprisings in
Outremer Word speaks of a kingdom
not Muslim Mongol or Jew

HUGH
Who are they

Winter Snow Ural mountains A small SLAVIC VILLAGE lies
nestled in a sea of white

SLAVIC VILLAGERS on patrol trying to keep warm in the cold
Dusk turns to NIGHT The moon low on the horizon

JACQUES (VO)
No one knows Just rumor legends
Some call them Vampirics from the
word Vampyr or Ubir Means witch
or Devil Superstitious madness
really But something evil lurks in
the East Deep within the black
forests and theyre on the
move threatening our borders

Movement in the SNOW below ONE SLAVIC thinks he sees
something He raises his torch but it’s hard to see in the
snow flurries Everything remains still He moves on

Suddenly SHADOWY SHAPES silently rise from under the snow

The SLAVIC walks torch in hand Suddenly one of the
SHADOWY SHAPES leaps out Flickering torchlight reveals

A HIDEOUS FACE

Wild bloodshot eyes Fangs Then --

SCREAMS Lost in the howling wind Blood in the snow
RESUME

EXT CASTLE MONTSEGUR BALCONY - DUSK

Both men stand overlooking the vineyard

JACQUES
Both King Philip and the Pope see
this instability as an opportunity
to gain a foothold in the Holy
Land I want you to come with me
to Paris I need you at my side
As my Seneschal

A beat Hugh stares off into the sunset

HUGH
Marcela questioned my faith back then
- whether I was fighting for God
or for those close to me that are
long since dead The truth is I
never knew But I am at peace now
My retirement from war is a blessing

JACQUES
You question your faith I understand
Then do it please for a dear old man

A beat Hugh bows slightly

HUGH
I would be honored

Jacques smiles throws an arm around him Together

Intrigued Philip crosses to the window looks down sees --

THE CARRIAGE Surrounded by an ARMED ESCORT ON HORSEBACK
A SQUAD OF PHILIPS ROYAL GUARDS stand at attention

EXT KING PHILIP’S PALACE -—- MOMENTS LATER

THE ARMED GUARDS roll out a canvas AWNING -- from the side
of the carriage car all the way to the palace front doors

The carriage door opens an IMPOSING FIGURE steps out
His entire body covered in black folded Bedouin-type ROBES
His face covered by a fierce-looking exotic WOODEN MASK

Another FIGURE exits Dressed in similar fashion with
folded robes and BLACK ARMOR The robes wrap up around

his face leaving only a slit for his eyes

The STRANGER walks under the awning toward the palace his
BODYGUARD following The STRANGER suddenly stops at the
front doors as if waiting for permission to enter

ROYAL SERVANTS gesture graciously inviting him in

INT PALACE GRAND HALLWAY - DAY

Our guests are lead down the hallway passing by

THE CHAPEL THE STRANGER sees the crucifixes relics

As he moves past the chapel doors SLAM SHUT -- on their own

INT PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

King Philip sits surrounded by his ROYAL COURT

THE STRANGER enters no sound of movement Like he’s
gliding on air He gently waves his hand -- extinguishing
all but a few candles dimming the room

He bows before Philip Respect

THE STRANGER
Forgive me For my eyes are
sensitive to the light

He then slowly removes his mask revealing that the Stranger
is ALEXIUS He hasnt aged a day

Alexius hands his mask to his Bodyguard We recognize the
stature of the Bodyguard It can only be VISAGO

ALEXIUS
I am Prince Alexius of Thuringia
I have travelled from the Far East
to be in your presence

KING PHILIP
Welcome to France Prince Alexius
And now that you are here what may
I ask is the purpose of your visit

ALEXIUS
The purpose is that we share a
common problem

KING PHILIP
Really And that is

ALEXIUS
The Templars

Philip bristles ever so slightly

ALEXIUS
The Templars are drunk with wealth
and power Your father practically
gave them your whole empire You
may rule this land but the Templars
are forever tied to it unless

KING PHILIP
Unless what

ALEXIUS
Unless you dissolve the Order
Do so and your debt goes with them
Only then will you be free
KING PHILIP
Impossible The Templars are
untouchable protected by the
Church It is out of the question

ALEXIUS
I believe you will find the Pope
amenable to this suggestion

KING PHILIP
And what do you hope to gain in
return Taking on such a powerful
adversary the wounds must run deep

ALEXIUS

You have no idea
(an uneasy beat)

Then there is the matter of your
son I offer you my condolences
I understand he is ill The
same sickness that took your wife
two years ago this very day

KING PHILIP
You forget your place Prince

ALEXIUS
I know of a way to save him A cure

KING PHILIP
-- there is no cure --

ALEXIUS
-- and the Templars possess it
The Holy Grail

Murmured gasps Philip’s interest piqued

KING PHILIP
The Cup of Christ

ALEXIUS
No mere cup Something even more
precious It is life itself
(a beat)
It is the Blood of Christ The
Holy Blood was divided into three
vials Now only two remain --

KING PHILIP
(stands)
Blasphemy Leave here at once

ALEXIUS
I offer you my allegiance I will
not offer a second time

KING PHILIP
I have no need to be part of your
vendetta nor do I need your
allegiance --

ALEXIUS
-- Then your kingdom will crumble
It will become a wasteland It
will fall before me like every
one that came before yours

Philip’s MEN-AT-ARMS inch their SWORDS from their sheaths

KING PHILIP
Challenge me if you must but it
will be your defeat

Alexius looks around sizing up the threat And backs down

ALEXIUS
Very well Then let us part as
brothers and not enemies

Alexius steps towards Philip hand outstretched A beat
Philip returns the gesture A handshake and an embrace
A kiss on each cheek then --

Alexius grabs Philips face and kisses him on the lips
Alexius’s teeth BITE into his lips We hear Philips

muffled screams as he struggles trying to break free from
this painful Judas kiss

Alexius breaks the embrace and Philip falls to the ground

Blood oozing from his torn lip Coughing trembling with
fear he looks up at Alexius

Alexius EYES have changed Blood red Animalistic Evil
His teeth are jagged SHARP Frightening

KING PHILIP
W-what -- what are you

ALEXIUS
I am the darkness in which all
life dies

The MEN-AT-ARMS PULL THEIR SWORDS AND ATTACK

Alexius ducks dodges and weaves each blow Their blades
smashing and hacking furniture gashing tapestries --

Alexius leaps up -- his TALON-LIKE FINGERS digging into
the stone wall He crawls along like a spider

VISAGO spins -- pulling off robes wrapped around his arms --

HUGH
To be a Templar you must be willing
to make many sacrifices abide by
many rules and obey to the letter
the word of our God --

The sparing intensifies Elyas matches Hugh’s every move

HUGH
-- A Templar must be merciful without
wickedness affable without treachery
compassionate towards the suffering
A just judge without favor or hate
He must prefer death to dishonor
And protect the Holy Church for she
cannot defend herself But above
all pay attention at all times

Hughs sword flicks Elyas sword right out of his hands He
sweeps Elyas feet from under him Elyas ends up on his ass
humiliated Laughter from the other Templars

Elyas grabs his sword and is back on his feet launching into
a stunning attack Hugh has to work to keep him at bay

Hugh sees a KNIFE now imbedded into the bone which he holds
in his hand He stares down at his unseen attacker

Its the Knight -- his face and armor smeared with blood
entrails He smiles Hugh stabs him a look Youre dead

scours again Really panicking This time he grabs the

interested in protecting the Templar
finances than the Christian faithful
The Order turned their back on Christ
You disgust us all with your lies and
treachery

You must tell us what we need to know
Help spare the lives of countless
others History will not look kindly
upon you otherwise And those even
with the most casual of connections to
the Templars will be hunted down and
executed

stone) We can see the darkened village of Chinon below

As SIMON carefully stacks DEVILS FIRE against the window
Charles unveils a SMALL MIRROR hanging from around his neck
Grabs a nearby torch He signals with the mirror and flame
INTERCUT WITH THE CHURCH TOWER AND THE PRISON TOWER

DEODAT sees the signal grabs his mirror and torch

DEODAT
Theyre in Ready your aim

LUC and RAYMOND ready their double-curved MONGOLIAN BOWS
The arrow shafts are tied with ROPE Deodat signals Charles

CHARLES sees the signal grabs a lit torch

CHARLES
Everyone back Back

Everyone takes cover Charles tosses the torch -- Ka-BOOM
BOOM BOOM The Devil Fire EXPLODES The tower rumbles
Rocks flame and debris rain down Smoke bellows

THROUGHOUT THE PRISON

GUARDS jump into action grabbing weapons Some stumble
drunk Theyve been caught completely off guard

And thats when Hugh and his men make their move swords
swinging -- taking down PRISON GUARDS at will

CUT TO
EXT SIXTY FEET UP THE PRISON TOWER - NIGHT
As the smoke clears we now see a GAPING HOLE in the tower
wall It worked CHARLES and SIMON knock away loose
stones widening the hole Creating a bigger target for --

LUC and RAYMOND Arrows raised and aimed -- they fire

TWO ARROWS streak across the night sky -- ROPE rapidly
unfurling in their wake -- streaking towards --

THE PRISON TOWER

Bull’s-eye Both arrows slingshot right through the hole
TEMPLARS grab the arrows tying off the ends of the rope --

LUC and RAYMOND doing the same -- making the rope taught
TWO ZIP LINES Two-hundred yards long Stretching from
the church tower to the prison tower Both lines run at a
twenty degree angle from end to end

IN THE PRISON TOWER

Charles has a TEMPLAR loop his cut CHAINS around the rope

CHARLES
Hold tight

-- and shoves him out of the tower The Templar zips down
the line -- across the rooftops -- sailing right towards --

THE CHURCH TOWER
-- where Luc and Raymond catch him Safe and sound
Deodat escorts the newly freed Templar towards a ladder

INTEXT CHURCH - NIGHT

FATHER THIERRY and his MONKS usher our TEMPLAR through the
church -- and out to where HORSE-DRAWN CARTS await

INT PRISON TOWER —- SAME

Charles looks pleased It worked He shoves another TEMPLAR
out the door down the line

AS TEMPLARS ZIP DOWN THE LINE OVERHEAD

PRISON GUARDS fire arrows trying to pick them off --

A TEMPLAR is hit -- he falls to his death
ANOTHER TEMPLAR is hit -- but holds on -- makes it to safety
ANOTHER TEMPLAR -- too weak to hold on -- lets go falls

TWO TEMPLARS are hit -- both falling -- both landing on a
rooftop One falls through the roof

With eyes following the escaping Templars -- A SQUAD OF
PHILIPS TROOPS charges for the church

Then we see -- ANIMAL-LIKE EYES -- glowing from beneath the
DARK WATERS OF THE MOAT watching the Templars above

INT TORTURE CHAMBER - SAME

Alexius breaks off the torture on Jacques He sees
something in his mind’s eye Alerting him

ALEXIUS
Theyre here

He looks at Jacques with disgust He couldnt break him
Alexius then looks away as if giving a silent command

EXT PRISON TOWER - RESUME

Suddenly VAMPIRIC KNIGHTS ERUPT FROM THE MOAT

Each armed to the teeth Hideous faces Blackened skin
slick with oil Yellow animalistic eyes Tarnished metal
jewelry and bones sewn into their faces

And leading them is VISAGO The group splits off Visago
and a few VAMPIRIC WARRIORS storm into the prison as --

SEVEN VAMPIRIC KNIGHTS begin CRAWLING UP the massive tower
Their CLAW-LIKE FINGERS digging into stone and mortar

And theyre moving fast

INT PRISON TOWER - SAME

Hugh and company fighting their way towards --

THE TORTURE CHAMBER

Hugh stands outside the thick WOODEN DOOR Tries it Locked
of course He pulls out a DEVILS FIRE Lights it Takes

cover Sssssssssssss BOOM Blows the door to splinters

HUGH kills the GUARDS and TORTURERS As the smoke clears
we see TEMPLARS strapped to various torture contraptions

He sees JACQUES DE MOLAY chained to the wall beaten In
real bad shape Hugh grabs a set of keys from a dead guard

JACQUES
Hugh no we are broken men we
will only slow you down --

HUGH
-- Then I will carry you --

JACQUES
Alexius the blood of the Grail
has corrupted him He seeks to

destroy the last two vials If he
succeeds it will be a world in
darkness everlasting There will
be no Resurrection The Devil will
inherit the earth and all of
humanity will suffer

Hugh can register only shock as he hears this then --

HUGH
We have the second vial from the
Paris Temple What is the location
of the third vial

Jacques sighs relief regarding the second vial
JACQUES
Only myself and one other know

In Baldock England The Citadel

We hear NOISES Getting closer Clocks ticking Hugh
begins quickly unlocking Jacques’ bonds and straps

JACQUES
No You must protect the Grail
That is all that matters Now go
Leave me That is an order
Hugh stops A beat He nods He has his orders
VAMPIRIC KNIGHTS appear raising their SHIELDS Suddenly
sharp METAL SPIKES SPRING OUT Like a porcupine The
Vampirics charge -- SPIKES IMPALING THE TWO TEMPLARS
Hugh stabs one Vampiric but it doesnt die
HUGH
(shocked)
In the name of God

VAMPIRIC KNIGHT
Not anymore

Hugh weighs his odds and runs --
UP IN THE PRISON TOWER

Charles hears a strange metallic sound CHINK CHINK
CHINK Curious he peers over the side sees --

VAMPIRIC KNIGHTS scaling the tower Already half way up
Simon looks down sees the Vampirics then looks at Charles

SIMON
We need to hurry

Charles fires a CROSSBOW BOLT -- Hits A VAMPIRIC right in
the eye Doesnt faze it ARROW VAMPIRIC keeps climbing

Charles reloads -- fires again Hits it right in the mouth
ARROW VAMPIRIC BITES DOWN snapping the arrow shaft in half

DOWN IN THE PRISON STAIRWELL
Hugh climbing -- VAMPIRIC giving chase -- closing in --
UP IN THE PRISON TOWER

SIMON hurls BLOCKS OF STONE at the Vampirics below But
they move fast -- dodging the onslaught

THE VAMPIRICS keep climbing

Simon lights a DEVIL FIRE drops it A VAMPIRIC catches
it stares Ka-BOOM Blows its hand off It falls

Charles pushes ANOTHER TEMPLAR out the tower A VAMPIRIC
leaps from the tower -- grabbing the Templars legs

CHARLES
Noooooooo

The Templar sails down the zip line VAMPIRIC latched around
his dangling legs The Vampiric bites into him He screams
as we literally see the LIFE DRAIN AWAY FROM HIM

Simon cuts the rope with his sword They both fall He
crosses himself saddened He had to do it

One zip line down One left AND ONE LAST TEMPLAR PRISONER

Charles shoves the Templar out the tower -- and he flies
along the zip line --

A PRISON GUARD below lights an arrow takes aim -- fires
The flaming arrow nails the Templar in back His clothes

catch fire -- turning him into a human fire ball

Flames ignite the rope -- it SEVERS The Templar falls

IN THE PRISON TOWER

The rope goes slack They look at each other Now what
IN THE CHURCH TOWER
DEODAT holds the slack rope horrified We see PHILIPS

TROOPS heading towards the church LUC takes off -- and
jumps down into the hole into the CATACOMBS

EXT CHURCH STABLES - NIGHT
THIRTY newly-freed TEMPLARS are loaded up into carts

DEODAT
Hold on

And theyre off --

Charles and Simon remain HUGH rushes in --

HUGH
We have to go Now
They all look at him How
Just as -- A VAMPIRIC charges up behind Hugh -- Hugh spins
swinging his sword -- blade decapitating the Vampiric

The headless body crumples But the head is still alive
wobbling on the floor Eyes full of rage

Hugh then grabs the rope checks the length --

HUGH
Over the side

SIMON
Are you mad

Hughs peers over the edge sees the EIGHTY-FOOT DROP and
THE FIVE VAMPIRICS clinging to tower staring up at him

HUGH
Perhaps

He takes a deep breath Fuck it Readies his sword -- and
leaps over the side --

EXT HIGH UP ON THE PRISON TOWER FACE —- NIGHT

As Hugh repels -- TWO VAMPIRICS attack -- swinging their
swords Hugh moves side to side parrying the blows --

ONE VAMPIRIC swings -- its blade just missing Hughs rope
Hugh sighs relief Then THWACK -- beheads the Vampiric

Hugh fights THE OTHER VAMPIRIC They both lose their swords
-- both blades falling -- skewering the earth below

The Vampiric lunges for Hughs throat -- grabbing Hughs
CRUCIFIX Its hand BURNS The Vampiric screams in pain
Hugh kicks the Vampiric right off the wall It falls

Two down three to go
HUGH
(to SimonCharles)

Well What are you waiting for

SIMON repels the tower followed by CHARLES --

A VAMPIRIC attacks CHARLES He swings his sword -- misses --
blade hits stone He loses his grip The sword falls --
nearly impaling Simon below -- but HUGH catches it

The Vampiric lunges for CHARLES again --

HUGH whistles -- flings his sword skyward -- SIMON catches
it -- pitches it higher -- CHARLES catches it and
DECAPITATES the Vampiric The headless body falls away --

A SECOND VAMPIRIC attacks SIMON --

CHARLES drops his sword -- SIMON catches it -- dispatching
the Vampiric And not a moment too soon because --

The THIRD and final VAMPIRIC skitters towards CHARLES --

SIMON heaves his sword skyward again -- CHARLES catches it --
and swings -- CUTTING OFF THE VAMPIRICS HANDS

Handless Vampiric staggers -- flapping its handless arms --
trying to keep balance -- trying not to fall backwards -- no
good Handless Vampiric screams and falls

CUT TO
AT THE FOOT OF THE TOWER

Hugh Simon and Charles reach bottom Hugh grabs both
fallen swords tosses one to Charles

HANDLESS VAMPIRIC attacks gnashing its fanged teeth It’s
still alive Hugh decapitates it Dead

Suddenly he sees --

MARCELA
He cant believe his eyes Is it another dream

HUGH
Marcela Youre alive How

Hes flooded with emotions He touches her arm feels her
skin Is she real She takes a step toward him something
greater than Alexius’ power moving her A flicker of
recognition She reaches out to touch Hugh’s face

WATCHING THEM FROM THE SHADOWS
ALEXIUS Crushed If he has a heart it’s breaking
VISAGO standing next to him moves to intercept Alexius’
arm suddenly BLOCKS Visago stopping him “Let her go”

once more Eyes vacant

CHARLES and SIMON look on in shock Just as --

PHILIPS TROOPS appear Suddenly they all drop to the
ground dead Each with an arrow in their back

Hugh grabs Marcela They all run dropping down into a
small hole in the earth -- A HIDDEN CATACOMB ENTRANCE

VAMPIRICS arrive on scene We see their GLOWING EYES They

SOMEWHERE UP AHEAD IN THE CATACOMBS
Our heroes on the move As they turn a corner --
A VAMPIRIC jumps out -- out of nowhere -- ready to kill

SIMON attacks Charles helps hurling SKULLS AT THE VAMPIRIC
-- one after another -- unlimited ammo Driving it back

ANOTHER VAMPIRIC tackles Hugh CRASHING them into a wall of
bones Hugh grabs a SPLINTERED FEMUR BONE and STABS the
Vampiric in the head

But it keeps coming even with a bone stuck in its skull

Hugh grabs another sharpened bone and WHAM Stabs it right
in the heart The Vampiric shrieks and explodes into ASH

Hugh takes note -- shouts out to Simon --

HUGH
The heart Go for the heart

And Simon does Killing the Vampiric

ground One tackles Hugh -- taking him down -- crashing

into a headstone cracking it in half

Hugh then shoves his sword deep into Vampiric’s HEART
But it doesnt die Hugh is confused What

It grabs Hugh ready to bite Gruesome filed-down teeth
sinking closer drool dripping slathering Hughs face

Hugh grabs A ROCK SNARLED WITH STRANDS OF VEGETATION and --
SHOVES IT down its throat THE VAMPIRIC freaks Foaming at
the mouth -- gagging convulsing -- screaming

woman There is no need to worry

CHARLES
Yet she rides with these devils

He’s got him there A beat Hugh nods
HUGH
She she is not one of them I
could not just leave her there

Right now our main concern is

Charles nods Understood
Suddenly something catches Hugh’s eye --
AT THE SHORELINE
We see EYES glinting in the darkness Vampirics Hugh
ready at the sword about raise the alarm but then sees

that they’re only WOLVES They scamper off into the brush

Hugh sighs relief then descends below deck

Hidden behind trees we see A LONG LINE OF ARMED VAMPIRIC
WARRIORS running quickly silently tracking the galley
The pack of wolves running with them

Marcela sleeps in some straw by the horses SHAFTS OF LIGHT
piercing through narrow wooden slats in the deck

Hugh watches her sleep gently pushes her hair away from her
face He cant help but notice she hasnt aged

HUGH
(to himself)

How How is this possible I saw
you die with my own eyes I

A beam of light falls on her light kissing her naked hand
Marcela immediately wakes jumps up screaming In pain
She recoils into the dark Horses whinny spooked

HUGH
Marcela what is it Whats wrong

She’s petrified of the light She holds her hand like a
wounded animal Hugh reaches for it she retracts

HUGH
It’s all right I won’t hurt you

He gently takes her hand looks the skin is BLISTERED
Hugh confused shocked She takes her hand back

HUGH
What has happened to you

No answer She only stares at him Eyes vacant
Suddenly we hear explosions The sounds of war
EXT MERCHANT GALLEY DECK - DUSK

Hugh and his fellow TEMPLARS topside arming themselves with
every weapon possible preparing

As the ship rounds the bend we see and hear a --
MASSIVE MARITIME BATTLE

EIGHTEEN TEMPLAR GALLEYS are battling it out against a fleet
of strange-looking ships -- ALEXIUS VAMPIRIC NAVY

Lifeless bodies Burning sinking ships A fiery graveyard
ON A PLATEAU OVERLOOKING THE BAY OF LA ROCHELLE

ALEXIUS stands watches as his catapults launch rocks and
fire pots -- pummeling the Templar fleet below

A VAMPIRIC SHIP RAMS A TEMPLAR GALLEY The bow plunging into
the galleys hull Timbers fly VAMPIRICS leap onto the
stricken Templar galley like a swarm of angry ants

ANOTHER VAMPIRIC SHIP heads right for our heroes --

JOSEPH
TAKE COVER
VAMPIRICS hurl FIRE LANCES Projectiles explode -- showering
Templars with RED HOT BURNING SAND They scream -- trying to

peel away their armor as the glowing sand burns their skin
The Vampiric galley pulls along side our merchant galley

A TWENTY FOOT GAP BETWEEN THE TWO VESSELS

Templars and Vampirics eyeballing one another Suddenly --
THE VAMPIRICS LEAP FROM THEIR SHIP

Sailing into the air -- across the water -- clearing the gap
-- some land on deck Some miss tumbling into the ocean

THE TEMPLARS counterattack Hugh leading the charge

HUGH
Go for the heart

TEMPLARS fire with deadly accuracy dropping Vampirics

Charles grabs TWO WOODEN SHARDS and STABS a Vampiric in the
heart But it keeps going Intense hand-to-hand combat

IN THE WATER

VAMPIRICS swim clinging onto the galleys hull with their
claws Others grab hold of the oars The galley slows --
the Vampirics extra weight making it too hard to row

Joseph yells to the OARSMEN below deck --
JOSEPH

Hard to starboard Throw your backs
into it

Oarsmen turn the galley into the Vampiric ship WHAM The
two vessels collide Oars shatter -- splintering like
toothpicks Shards of wood IMPALING VAMPIRICS

The vessels SCRAPE HULLS VAMPIRICS clinging on are crushed

We hear bones snapping -- gargling screams -- bodies popping
ANOTHER TEMPLAR GALLEY sails towards them -- coming to their
rescue -- launching fire arrows at the Vampiric ship setting

it ablaze The ship sinks

IN THE WATER

TEMPLARS Some alive some dead Some clinging to debris
Some struggle trying to stay afloat -- heavy armor pulling

them down Others shouting arms waving desperately

Crews pluck them from the water Hugh pulls a wounded
Templar aboard This is CHRISTUS DES BARRES

HUGH
Where is Roger Le Flor

Christus points Hugh looks and sees --

ROGERS GALLEY

Marooned against the craggy rocks Surf pounding the
wreckage Lifeless bodies strewn about Bags of gold and
silver glittering in the firelight

AND HIGH ABOVE ON A SIXTY-FOOT CLIFF

ROGER LE FLOR fends off A HOARD OF VAMPIRIC KNIGHTS

They push Roger back towards the edge of the cliff Theres
nowhere for him to run He’s trapped

Roger holds THE SECOND VIAL

The Vampirics smell it Whipping them up into a frenzy like
sharks to blood They attack bringing him to his knees

A VAMPIRIC grabs the SECOND VIAL As it raises the vial up
ready to SMASH it back down on the ground --

HIS ARM COMBUSTS INTO HOLY FLAME Consuming its whole body
AN ARC OF HOLY FLAME SHOOTS OUT THROUGH THE VIAL engulfing
other Vampiric Knights

The Vial drops

-Roger dives and CATCHES IT

As he staggers to his feet -- ANOTHER VAMPIRIC leaps --
landing on Rogers back -- sinking its sharpened teeth into
his neck They BOTH FALL off the edge of the cliff

AS THEY FALL -- Roger sticks the VAMPIRIC with a dagger and
pushes away but the precious VIAL slips from his grasp
THE VIAL falls tumbling through space

Roger reaches a desperate last grab for it but misses --

WHAM Both Roger and the VIAL CRASH ONTO THE ROCKS BELOW
The glass vial CRACKS OPEN

HOLY BLOOD pours mixing with frothing seawater Suddenly --
A SHOCK OF BLINDING WHITE LIGHT

A beat Then the immediate area of ocean STARTS TO BOIL

VAMPIRICS in the water scramble towards the warships as A
ROLLING SHOCK WAVE OF BOILING OCEAN QUICKLY FANS OUT

The wave ENGULFS THE VAMPIRICS They scream as they COMBUST
INTO FLAME AND EXPLODE INTO ASH Only the floating wreckage
of Vampiric armour is left in the wave’s wake steaming

Some Vampirics make it back to one of the WARSHIPS ON FIRE
Their FLESH DRIPPING OFF THEM as they climb the riggings

The rigging catches fire The FIRE SPREADS The deck
masts oars sails anything not metal BURNS

The WARSHIP is soon an inferno

The boiling ocean FADES as the Holy Blood within it finally
dissipates Gone

HUGH -- just witnessed it all -- the power of God But at
what cost Another vial is now lost His friends death

THREE TEMPLAR GALLEYS AND THE MERCHANT SHIP are all that
remain They slip away sailing north towards England

Hugh sits with WILLIAM DE LA MORE (Master of the London

News from France has travelled fast
But so far no action from King Edward
He is to marry Philip’s daughter

He only has peace in mind with the
French Right now their enemy is his

HUGH

And this enemy which King Philip
supports is infected with a plague
that can wipe out this very country

And they will invade England
only a matter of time

William digests the grim news then

WILLIAM

As of now the Order has roughly ten
thousand men scattered throughout

HUGH

Then we will need King Edwards

support and his troops Once we are
settled I will plead our case to him

standing as high as the tallest trees

Crenellated turrets towers battlements huge stained glass
windows All enclosed by a stone defensive wall A moat
rings the entire Citadel full of pond scum buzzing flies
The forest has started to reclaim this forgotten Citadel
Covered with vines moss Though it’s seen better days
it’s still an impressive Gothic structure We then see
Smoke spiraling A WATCH HOUSE Hidden amongst the trees

Hugh nods Templars fan out investigating

EXT THE CITADEL —- DAY

Templars walk around it The drawbridge is down Hugh
goes up to the imposing oak double doors behind the iron
portcullis (gates) They won’t budge Locks rusted shut

ARNAUD
So does anyone have a key or do
we break in

VOICE (0S)
Well you could break in -- or you
could just ask me

Startled they turn to see --
A Templar Knight (60s) And his physique suggests it’s been

a while since he’s seen action Dead squirrels slung over
his shoulder A man from long ago OLIVER OF SAUNFORDE

OLIVER
About time the Order sent some
reinforcements or replacements

(re dead squirrels)
Just out getting some breakfast
Hungry anyone

He then sees Hugh memories flooding back

OLIVER
Hugh Hugh de Paynes Or
should I say Hugh the Hand

They hug Old friends and war buddies reunited

HUGH
Oliver What’re you doing here

OLIVER

Thats what I should be asking you
After the fall of Acre I was assigned
here Protector of the Grail Ordered
here by Jacques de Molay himself And
a fine mess I was left in Me --a
decrepid old man asked to look after
this entire place all by myself

(laughs)
And how is our beloved Grand Master
these days

Sore subject Hugh hesitates gathers up the courage
HUGH
The third vial of Holy Blood Is

it here

Olivers face falls Grim A beat then smiles
OLIVER
Well of course its here

Cheeky bastard Everyone sighs relief

Oliver inserts the key into the lock

CHARLES
This isnt a bloody joke

It won’t turn

Uses a bit of brute force and the key snaps off

quickly sidesteps it as it SMASHES on the floor

Ah just as I left it

CHARLES
The place is filthy

OLIVER
Yes just as I left it

fast for an old man

Oliver

Pretty

Luc feels a TAPESTRY hanging on the wall It tears off in

his hands

It looks like he’s going to weep

RAYMOND
Sacrilege A fine way to leave the
most sacred treasures of our Lord

OLIVER
Yes I’m sure that if and when the
Second Coming of Christ comes
along hed be really happy that we
kept a bunch of useless trinkets
around to remind him that we all
killed him the first time round

RAYMOND
It’s so we remember you ingrate

OLIVER
I thought that faith and religion
were in the heart not in objects

CHARLES
And what do you mean if the Second
Coming happens

He pulls his SWORD but Oliver’s sword is already at his
neck Charles eyeballs the blade

OLIVER

You forget my boy though my girth

might say otherwise I was and still

am a Templar one long before you

And I must say quicker too

different part of the crypt is illuminated revealing

THE TREASURY Chests overflowing with gold and silver
coins precious stones Painted portraits of various
saints chalices holy artifacts relics And

A WOODEN CROSS

Hanging on the far wall Big enough to crucify someone on
Probably because it is the one and only TRUE CROSS

Templars kneel bowing their heads Oliver crosses over
to shelves lined with HUNDREDS OF BOOKS Ancient bibles
and religious texts
CHARLES
Is that really the True Cross

OLIVER
All the way from Jerusalem
(thinking back)
Lost it at the Battle of Hattin
Had to buy it back from Saladin
Quite an embarrassing blunder

He pulls out a thick BIBLE Opens it No pages Just
familiar SILVER BOX He hands it to Hugh

OLIVER
I believe this is what youre looking
for The blood of our saviour

Hugh opens it carefully pulls out the VIAL

He sees a glimpse of Marcela’s face then eyes Hugh

shoes SOIL FROM ACRE Oliver feels it Remembers

OLIVER
Very curious

Oliver uncovers Marcela’s face He’s just seen a ghost
OLIVER

Not a blemish nor a wrinkle

Stunned he looks at Hugh for answers

HUGH
She is not the same person

Hugh holds up a small mirror angles it towards Marcela

IN THE MIRROR -- Oliver just sees her robes No face
Marcelas physical body casts NO REFLECTION

OLIVER
(to himself)
What devil possesses you child

Suddenly she awakens and lunges at Oliver Her eyes WHITE
She thrashes violently her manacles holding her down

Oliver jumps back in shock And crosses himself
Several times

INT WATCH HOUSE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Oliver guzzles wine straight from the flagon Takes a
moment to compose himself Hugh sits looking on

HUGH
The others do not know

OLIVER
Wise choice
(sits thinking back)
In my time on my many travels I
have treated famine victims leprosy
the plague But this What is this
This scourge

HUGH
I dont know But whatever this --
blood disease she suffers from there
are hundreds if not thousands just
like her There must be a cure

OLIVER
For there to be a cure there must be
a source

Hugh comes clean

HUGH
The source of this disease is a man
Or he used to be a man Alexius of

Thuringia

That’s a name Oliver hasn’t heard in ages

OLIVER
Impossible

HUGH
He drank the blood of Christ

Oliver looks horrified And drinks again

HUGH
He stole that which was reserved
for the son of God alone He is now
after the last remaining vial We
lost the second vial in France

OLIVER
And Marcela is one of them

HUGH
(nods )
I could not abandon her not again

Oliver lays his hand on Hugh’s shoulder

OLIVER
Love has lead many men astray
Hugh

(MORE )

OLIVER(contd)

You should not have brought her
here You must realize my
brother that she is no more than
a vessel -- no more than the Devil
possesses her

(a beat)
Now You say they feast on blood
What kind Animal

HUGH
Human

OLIVER
The blood of Christ was collected
by Joseph of Arimathea as our Lord
was crucified And once the Order
took possession The Keepers of the
Grail divided His Holy Blood into
three vials -- The Holy Trinity

HUGH
To ensure that at least one of the
vials survives for the Second Coming
of our Lord

OLIVER
A world without end Heaven on Earth

HUGH
But should someone destroy all three
vials God will abandon us and the
promise of salvation ends A world
forever in darkness

A heavy beat lingers Oliver paces thinking aloud

OLIVER
This army you encountered -- any
weaknesses Anything we can use
against them

HUGH

They are unmatched Almost impossible
to kill But they all seemed affected
with the same affliction

(off Oliver’s look)
They fear the simplest artifacts of
Christian faith Holy water
crucifixes even garlic And they
hide in the shadows Deathly afraid
of sunlight It burns them

OLIVER
They fear the symbols of Christ
because the Devil possesses them

HUGH
I stabbed one in the heart with my
sword it did not die Yet I
stabbed another with a bone froma
grave and it was destroyed
OLIVER

Holy artifact Anything buried on
hallowed ground becomes holy itself

HUGH
But how does something unholy even
walk on hallowed ground

OLIVER

Ah That explains the soil in the
boots Soil from the ground where
they died That protects them

(a beat)
However this is just all speculation
You forget I was a doctor Hugh It
was my gift and my curse

Oliver crosses himself A flicker of life back in his eyes
A man awoken from a long slumber

A sudden knock CHARLES enters

CHARLES
Someone approaches

EXT CITADEL - MOMENTS LATER

LUC stands staring out at the forest Hugh Charles and
Oliver approach Luc holds a finger to his lips Quiet

OLIVER
Easy for you to say

HUGH
(whispers)
How many

Luc holds up both hands Ten Everyone draws their swords
Suddenly the sound of horse hooves Riders approaching

TEN MEN Weary Wounded One man is missing an ARM the
stump cauterized above his elbow

One rider pulls his horse forward GUY DE PANAZ He bows

GUY
I am Guy De Panz From the Order
of Barbera in Spain We received
our orders from the London Temple

Hugh and the others do not lower their swords

HUGH
(testing him)
Where does the magnificence of the
Templars dominate

GUY
(quoting from memory)
To the Three Indias through the
deserts toward the place of the rising
sun through the valley of deserted
Babylon to the Tower of Babel up to
God and the very Heavens themselves

HUGH
Then I bid you welcome

INT CITADEL DINING ROOM - LATER
Knights sit around the table talking Oliver offers wine

GUY
- We held out as long as we could
but we were no match for the night
killers

RAYMOND looks at the last slab of meat in the middle of the
table Sees one of Guy’s men DOMINIQUE OF ITIER the one
with the missing arm eyeing it too

RAYMOND
What happened to the arm

DOMINIQUE
One of the devils bit me Saw what
happened to the others They rose
from the dead I took care of it
myself Though it was my good arm

As Raymond goes to snag the last piece of meat with his fork
-- Dominique stabs the meat for himself

DOMINIQUE
But this arm is not so bad either

INT WATCH HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

Hugh squeezes blood from his forearm into a bowl He hands
it to a calmer more “human”-looking Marcela She drinks

We see the blood flow through her veins More flesh knits
onto her bones beneath her skin Her skin color returning

She stares at Hugh’s necklace with their WEDDING RINGS on it
Mesmerized Hugh takes notice He holds it up showing her

HUGH
We were together You and I
Once long ago Do you remember

No response His hopes dashed Marcela then reaches out
and touches the wedding bands

FLASHBACK -- VARIOUS SUN BLEACHED IMAGES

A younger HUGH and MARCELA Together In love Their
children Smiling face Laughing A family

Marcela stirs As if slowly awakening from a haze Then --
MARCELA
(whispers)
Hugh
Hugh looks at her In shock Joy Sadness

MARCELA
I remember I loved you

Hesitantly he moves closer to her She doesn’t get agitated
like before She looks at him eyes brimming with sadness

MARCELA
» and you loved me We had
children They were

A tear falls from her eye She remembers Hugh sits on the
edge of the bed Old wounds opening up For both of them

MARCELA
I love you still can this be
true I died What am I

His hand touches hers Cold

HUGH
What happened How did you survive

A beat Hesitant then

MARCELA
He came for me Said he loved me --

Suddenly she sits up Fearful Eyes staring unfocused

HUGH
He cannot find you We are safe here

MARCELA
You are not safe from him No one
is He will find what he seeks
and this land will fall like all
the others before

HER VOICE CARRIES OVER THE FOLLOWING IMAGES --
Night Alexius surveys the windswept desert landscape

MARCELA (VO)
He died in Acre just as I did

He turns his flowing CLOAK WIPING THE FRAME TO BLACK

MARCELA (VO)

He wanted eternal life to save
me But instead he cursed us both
He carries the mark of the devil and
passes it to everyone he touches

Alexius and Visago ride A SMALL ARMY marches behind them

MARCELA (VO)
Villages were the first to perish

SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE-EAST

Alexius and his men slash their way through an Arab village
Drinking the blood of their victims

Alexius cuts down a MOTHER her child in her arms He
stares at the child and smiles revealing FANGED TEETH

MARCELA (VO)
And the dead would rise and join him

Dark Muddy Raining Alexius leads his ever-growing ARMY
through the mountainous terrain Another village in sight

ALEXIUS MEN cheer as one of their own is slaughtered BLOOD
gathered in cups Imprisoned villagers forced to drink the
tainted blood Now joining the ranks of the infected

MARCELA (VO)
His army grew like a plague

Alexius’ growing army camped out His Warriors FILING THEIR
TEETH DOWN to razor sharp fangs

MARCELA (VO)
First villages then cities And
then nations

AN UNKNOWN CITY ON FIRE

Silhouetted against the glowing flames Alexius’ men look
like an army of SHADOWS Moving with inhuman speed Leaping
from walls and rooftops Swords slashing Killing everyone

Alexius’ men RIPPING out the throats of the soldiers with
their sharpened filed down TEETH drinking their blood

MARCELA (VO)

Forced to fight and live in the
shadows But he found a way to
survive and thrive

Alexius Army marches The procession stretches for miles
A carriage leads the way Inside it ALEXIUS and MARCELA

MARCELA (VO)
He must extinguish all hope He must
destroy the vials of Christ’s blood

His hand takes hers He looks into her eyes but she looks
away She is a prisoner

MARCELA (VO)

Then the darkness will fall He
will rule forever as its king and
me as his queen

BACK TO
As they were Hugh taking it all in thinking

HUGH
But why Why must he destroy the
remaining vials

MARCELA
For the blood is the life And
that which created him could also
be used to destroy him
(a beat)
You know everything as does he
HUGH
What do you mean

MARCELA
I am his eyes his ears Through me
he has seen everything He now knows
where the last vial of Holy Blood is
(off Hugh)
We are all the same and we serve one
master When you succumb to him
you become an empty vessel to do his
bidding You lose everything
human Hope Dreams Memories
(a beat)
That is why he tortures your Grand
Master hoping to break his will
Hoping he will reveal the location
of the final vial And should that
fail then that is why he let me go
with you

Hugh takes this in She is a victim Everyone is

MARCELA
I know that I love you How and
why I remember I know not
(looks away)
He is distant the echo of his
voice rings silent His power
over me is weak but it grows
(a beat)
He is coming Now As we speak
Assembling his troops and war
machines You cannot win

Off Hughs horrified look --

EXT CITADEL DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Hugh stands with the others Hes just spilled it all
Everyone digests whats been said The news is grim

SIMON
We should take the Grail and leave
Save lives while we still can

HUGH
Leave And go where

SIMON
Anywhere

HUGH
If we run then he will follow We
will only prolong the inevitable
We must stay and fight

CHARLES
Fight We dont stand a chance

CHRISTUS
That beast betrayed us If we kill her
then we cut off their communication

HUGH
No She is a victim We must show
compassion

CHRISTUS

It is an abomination of our God It
must be destroyed before more damage
is done

He unsheathes his sword Hugh grabs his sword The others
move in on HUGH swords drawn A standoff

HUGH
All of you move against me now

SIMON
She is no longer a woman She must
be destroyed Her soul must be
saved Whatever evil possesses
her could infect us all

CHRISTUS
Why do you protect this woman so

A beat Everyone waiting for an answer then

HUGH
She was my wife

Everyone falls silent in shock A beat Hugh soldiers on

HUGH
I gave her up for the Order I
gave up everything
(pulling it together)
My brothers I have asked nothing of
you before and now I ask only this

Templars look to each other swords are sheathed

HUGH
She may be able to help our cause

CHRISTUS
Really And hows that

HUGH
She is their link to us and us to
them That becomes our advantage
and their undoing We have no time
to waste

ready to invade England And King
Philip of France is providing support
for this enemy

EDWARD II
I will not believe such lies You
fled France like common thieves
You are all wanted men I should
have you arrested and turned over
to him at once

HUGH

Your Highness I speak the truth
You have been deceived by a lie
The Order was betrayed by King
Philip and His Holiness

(a beat desperate)
This army is infected with a plague
that can wipe out this country
Most of Europe has already fallen
We need your support and your
troops We are simply not enough

Isabella looks up from her needlepoint in shock
EDWARD II

You come to me with mad tales of
plague and enemy warships You
offend my Queen by defaming her
father in her presence asking me
to make war with France Our
future ally My future family

(a nervous beat)
Leave my presence at once

EXT TOWER OF LONDON - MOMENTS LATER

Hugh is escorted out Charles stands waiting By the
look on Hugh’s face he knows it’s not good news

HUGH
We need to raise our own army
Dispatch scouts and messengers to

Order has done much good here and
the people will not forget that

CHARLES

Christus kisses his rosary crosses himself He then holds
his sword above her ready to strike --

As he plunges the blade towards her --
Another sword smashes through Christus blade severing it

HUGH

Warships head towards us from ports
the world over surrounding the
British Isles The English held
port of Calais in France has also
been overrun

(points to map)
The first attack will be here at
Dover

(a beat serious)
The enemy we face is like no other
And as King Edward refuses to make war
with France we shall face them alone

(murmurs groans

from the others)
This army carries a sickness in their
blood which they can spread to others
If you are bitten then you are dead
but still alive The worst death of
all

OLIVER
Remember common blades will not
vanquish the enemy for we face an
army of devils Therefore everything
based in Christian faith can be used
as a weapon against them Crucifixes
garlic religious relics Sunlight
will destroy them God is the light
and the Devil is the darkness

HUGH
From this day forward you are all
Knights And we all fight as one
We fight to save our God our country
our families

Guilt Duty Honor Then --

They kiss She suddenly stops and slowly pulls away

MARCELA
I am cold to you aren’t I

HUGH
No

MARCELA
It’s because I am not meant to be
Whoever I was back so many years
ago still loves you and that

will never die

OLIVER
It is today that I truly live again

The two embrace

Hugh mounts his horse PETE also in full armor He rides
in front of his army looking over the many faces Fathers
sons brothers husbands He knows many will never return

HUGH
A Templar Knight is truly a fearless
knight for his soul is protected by
the armor of faith just as his body
is protected by the armor of steel
He is thus doubly-armed and need
fear neither demons nor men This
is no army we face It is a force
of will One man’s will And we
shall break it God wills it

Everyone cheers The armies then split up heading off
into four separate directions

With the King’s blessing he has
released all of his forces over to

DISSOLVE TO
EXT BEACHES OF DOVER - DAWN
Grey overcast skies Dense fog

A heavily fortified beachhead Templar encampment nestled
between THE WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER and the shoreline

LOOKOUTS scan the horizon with telescopes MESSENGER BOYS
armor slightly too big for them sit shivering in the chill

Hugh sits atop his warhorse Pete surveying his hodgepodge
army Templars Royal Knights civilian militia All
fighting for the same cause Charles rides up to him

CHARLES
We still dont have enough men

HUGH
Numbers arent everything

Then suddenly --

A DARK TRIANGULAR MASS slowly emerges through the fog

A SAIL Like a giant shark fin Dozens of oars plowing the
water A WARSHIP

LOOKOUT
Enemy on the horizon

Suddenly more ships appear A massive blockade

Hugh raises his telescope looks sees ARMORED VAMPIRICS
on deck Their blood red eyes glowing in the heavy mist
The warships drop anchor just beyond the breakers

KNIGHTS move into position ARCHERS ready their bows
GREGORY looks up to the overcast sky No sun At all

GREGORY
Cursed English weather

Suddenly the SUN starts breaking through the clouds
Knights raise their swords cheering

GREGORY
God is on our side
(egging them on)
Cmon Whatre you waiting for

Laughter More taunting
HUGH
They will wait for the sun to set
That is why we hit them now Fire
Templar Commanders carry out the order and

ON THE BEACHHEAD AND CLIFFS ABOVE

BOOM-BOOM-BOOM Bombards blast away -- firing primitive
cannonballs Catapults lobbing stones and fire pots

Ordinance rains down Scoring direct hits But the heavy
bombardment only DENTS the warships outer metal shields

Hugh takes it all in discouraged

HUGH
Cease fire

As the smoke clears the warships metal shields slowly
UNFOLD revealing CATAPULTS and BOMBARDS

Here comes the first strike

HUGH
Take cover

Everyone does so just as
THE WARSHIPS FIRE
Catapults launch DOZENS OF MASSIVE IRON CANNONBALLS

WHAM Cannonballs rain down -- SMASHING the encampment --
blowing Knights apart on impact -- explosions of sand

A few cannonballs sail overhead PUMMELING the white cliffs
then roll back down the cliffs like runaway wrecking balls --
rolling down into the Templar encampment

Knights gather round looking on intently at the strange
cannonballs weapons poised Suddenly --

The cannonballs CRACK OPEN revealing BLACK ARMORED
VAMPIRIC WARRIORS A lethal broadsword in each hand

These are REAPERS
Then a bizarre WHIRRING sound emanates from within the

Reapers armor The armor is mechanized Feet LIFT OFF
THE GROUND as metal extensions LOCK INTO PLACE Stilts

The Reapers now stand TWELVE FEET TALL towering over the
battlefield Extensions lock into place on their SWORDS --
doubling the length and reach of each blade

THE REAPERS walk -- their long strides covering ground
faster than any man on foot Broadswords slashing
decapitating Knights with single strokes

KNIGHTS fire their crossbows but the bolts harmlessly
bounce off the Reapers armor No effect At all

CUT TO
VAMPIRIC WARSHIPS begin launching smaller LANDING BOATS
The small shielded boats row towards shore as
HUNDREDS OF ARMED VAMPIRIC WARRIORS leap from the decks of
the massive warships -- jumping overboard -- splashing down
into the water -- disappearing below the surface
ON THE BEACH
REAPERS slaughter the overwhelmed Templar forces
GREGORY grabs a barrel of BLACK POWDER Lights the fuse --
and kicks the barrel down the sand dune It rolls between

the REAPERS LEGS fuse burning down and

Ka-BOOM The barrel EXPLODES -- blowing the REAPER to
shrapnel Remains collapsing in a fiery blaze One down

CHARLES rolls another lit barrel -- BOOM Blows a Reapers
stilt-leg off It teeters topples Another down

CUT TO
HUGH runs coils of ROPE in hand He throws the other end

of the rope to CHRISTUS Together they run straight
towards a REAPER -- rope held in a taut line between them

They run circles around the Reaper -- rope wrapping around
its legs -- all while ducking the Reapers slashing blades

The Reaper steps forward and CRASHES TO THE GROUND
Templars pounce on it -- STABBING swords into slit openings

in the helmet and armor Blood sprays Templars pull the
Reaper’s helmet off decapitating the Vampiric inside

CATAPULTS launch ROCKS AND FIRE POTS at the Reapers One
Reaper is crushed by a rock Another hit with a fire pot

But the Reaper fights on engulfed in FLAMES Each fiery
sword cutting down Knights or setting them ablaze
AT THE SHORELINE
DOZENS OF LANDING BOATS hit the beach
Gangplanks kick down and HEAVILY ARMORED VAMPIRIC KNIGHTS
roll off huge WHEELED IRON BOXES onto the beach The boxes

themselves must weigh a ton but what’s inside

Once in position Vampirics start rotating levers on the side
of each IRON BOX And whatevers inside starts to extend

A LONG NECK of interlocking IRON AND BRONZE COMPONENTS
stretches high up into the air like a crane As the neck
fully extends a BRONZE DISC begins to bloom open

A MASSIVE METAL UMBRELLA

Standing 150 feet tall The disc spans 300 feet in diameter
And it’s blocking out THE SUN

ALL UP AND DOWN THE BEACH

We see a long line of SUN-BLOCKING DISCS unfurl Call these
giant contraptions SHADOWCASTERS

The beach is now cast in eternal TWILIGHT
AT THE SHORELINE

LEGIONS OF VAMPIRIC WARRIORS AND ARCHERS emerge from the
surf like medieval sea monsters Armed to the teeth

NOTE These “Secondary Warriors are dressed in light armor
Not as protective from the sun as the First Wave Warriors

VAMPIRIC ARCHERS take up the frontal position Their arrows
armed with a pointed GLASS VIAL TIP And inside the vial
red liquid Blood VAMPIRIC BLOOD They fire

A SWARM OF GLASS-TIPPED ARROWS BLACK OUT THE SKY

CHARLES
Shields Shields

TEMPLARS raise their SHIELDS for cover -- THK-THK-THK-THK
Infected blood sprays as the glass vials shatter on impact
But dozens are hit CHARLES checks himself A glass-tipped
arrow just missed hitting skin He sighs relief
94

THOUSANDS OF VAMPIRIC WARRIORS charge up the rocky beachhead
-- all under the shaded protection of the Shadowcasters

HUGH mounts his horse rallies the troops

HUGH
Lets hold em here Charge

AND THE TWO ARMIES CRASH together

Metal against metal Swords cut and sever Body parts
fly Vampirics biting Knights with their sharpened teeth

As a VAMPIRIC spars with a Templar -- IT SEES THE ROSARY
AROUND THE TEMPLARS NECK The Vampiric quickly looks away

ANOTHER KNIGHT holds up his ROSARY as protection but the
Vampiric CHOPS the KNIGHTS ARM OFF which holds the rosary

Hugh realizes his men are losing momentum He looks up --
an idea He rides yelling pointing at the SHADOWCASTERS

HUGH
Take ‘em down Fire Fire

Templars reposition their CATAPULTS and fire -- flinging
rocks and fire pots at the SHADOWCASTERS

Ordinance rains down pounding the Shadowcasters One sways
under the heavy bombardment The towering structure topples
over -- crashing down killing men

ANOTHER SHADOWCASTER weaves Metal groans bending It
buckles -- colliding into another one Total domino effect

HUGH smiles Likes what he sees but

KNIGHTS felled by infected arrows now rise to their feet
Eyes crimson red Feverish They grab their weapons --
joining the ranks of the VAMPIRIC WARRIORS

Hughs smile fades He rides back towards the trenches
We see line after line of ARCHERS -- ROPE tied around the
arrow shafts They stand ready weapons raised

HUGH
Fire

Arrows fly impaling Vampirics We follow the other ends
of the ROPE each rope is TIED TO A LINE OF HORSES

HUGH
Now
RIDERS spur their horses The horses bolt -- rope unfurling
-- snags taught -- and DRAGS THE IMPALED VAMPIRICS BACK INTO

THE SUNLIGHT They scream instantly turning to ASH
ANOTHER LINE OF ARCHERS fire -- skewering Vampirics -- horses
dragging them across the sand into the sunlight Some try
clawing their way back into the shade Not gonna happen

But the Vampirics keep coming

HUNDREDS OF LANDING BOATS hit the shore VAMPIRICS swarming
the beach -- climbing the cliffs They’re everywhere

A grim situation Hugh knows its time

HUGH
Full retreat

The order is passed along KNIGHTS head for the hills
AT THE SHORELINE
An elaborate-looking LANDING VESSEL pulls ashore

First off VISAGO then ALEXIUS Alexius surveys the carnage
A Vampiric Warrior brings him his BLACK ARMORED HORSE

EXT COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK

The sun hangs low in the sky A solitary burning ember

Hugh leads the remnants of his rag tag army across the
fields Riding directly into the setting sun

And behind them --
VAMPIRIC WARRIORS giving chase Closing the gap Fast

CHRISTUS
Well never outrun ‘em

Hugh rides past a WINDMILL The canvas sails in an X
position Hugh pulls his horse to a stop An idea

CHRISTUS
Whatre you doing

HUGH
Follow me

INT WINDMILL - MOMENTS LATER
HUGH and the others work the windmills operating gears
EXT WINDMILL - DUSK

The windmills rectangular-shaped sails turn locking into
an upright position The setting sun behind it

The shadow the windmill casts now looks like a CROSS

WIDEN TO REVEAL
A FIELD LITTERED WITH WINDMILLS
CUT TO

As HOARDS OF VAMPIRIC WARRIORS ascend over the horizon we
now see what they see

A mile-wide line of WINDMILL CROSSES

Vampirics are instantly CAUGHT in the long far reaching
cross shadows They scream in horror falling from their
horses Others turn their horses around full retreat

HUGH and his TEMPLAR KNIGHTS form up swords raised

HUGH
God wills it

They charge towards the Vampirics -- mercilessly HACKING
the heads off the fallen warriors FARMERS armed with
pitchforks join in staking Vampirics to ground

Templars watch the remaining Vampirics retreat back towards
the coast They’ve just bought themselves a little time

Hugh and the others then gallop towards the forest
EXT COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK

As the sun melts away on the horizon the windmill shadows
shrink A few stars now visible ALEXIUS appears leading
his vast army across the countryside

ALEXIUS
Forward Victory awaits
(to Visago)
We must reach their sanctuary
before dawn

Visago nods

EXT THE CITADEL —- NIGHT

All is quiet OLIVER scans the near distance DARK FIGURES
emerge from the forest running across the cleared area

Oliver takes a CROSSBOW Puts on his glasses Takes aim

OLIVER
Oi Who goes there

But the SHADOWY FIGURES keep moving forward Oliver fires
A BOLT hums past just missing SIMON We see CHRISTUS
GREGORY and other Knights right behind him hands up

SIMON
Whoa Hold your fire

Oliver and Knights greet them giving them water

OLIVER
Wheres Hugh

SIMON
On his way

Oliver adjusts his thick lensed glasses His distorted
large eyeballs staring back at Simon Simon stares

OLIVER
I see just fine Trust me

EXT FOREST —- NIGHT

Vampirics marching through dense forest lugging heavy
equipment Their wolf-like eyes glowing in the moonlight

EXT WATERMILL —- NIGHT

Hugh Luc and Charles at the mill Dozens of barrels full
of BLACK POWDER stacked up against the mill sluice gates

Luc puts his finger to his lips He hears something They
look and can see the distant treetops sway as the Vampiric
Army worms its way through the forest

EXT FOREST RIVERBED - NIGHT

VAMPIRIC WARRIORS advance down a rocky sloping surface

Visago sees hoofprints footprints

VISAGO
They came this way

Alexius crouches down fingers touching the soil Dry
Smooth stones laced with dried lichen Suddenly his ears
prick up He hears something a heartbeat A voice
EXT WATERMILL - NIGHT

Hugh and Charles -- each with one hand dipped in the river
-- the other clenched around their crucifix Blessing the
water Both reciting the The Lords Prayer in Latin

HUGHCHARLES
Libera nos a malo amen

Luc with FLAMING ARROW raised and aimed --
EXT FOREST RIVERBED - NIGHT
Alexius stands up It suddenly dawns on him

Theyre all standing in the middle of a river bed

ALEXIUS
It’s a trap Retreat

EXT WATERMILL — SAME

Luc fires The watermill EXPLODES The damned up river
rushes down into the dry river bed like a TIDAL WAVE

EXT CITADEL - SAME
Oliver hears the blast echo He smiles He knows
EXT FOREST RIVERBED - SAME

ALEXIUS runs for cover as the massive wave of HOLY WATER
engulfs the Vampirics -- sweeping them away down stream

Some cling onto rocks but their flesh and muscle BURN AND
DISSOLVE TO BONE as theyre battered by the surging waters

Vampirics lose their grip and are washed away Their
skeletal remains SMASHING to pieces against the rocks

ALEXIUS looks at the remains of his army Stragglers pull
themselves from the flowing river their LEGS AND ARMS
DISSOLVED AWAY

Half of his army destroyed Washed away Just like that

Alexius’ eyes burn with fury

EXT THE CITADEL - NIGHT
HUGH CHARLES and LUC dismount Winded yet victorious

OLIVER
Cleansed a few souls did you

HUGH
Aye Just a few

ARNAUD and GUY ride up battle-weary winded
ARNAUD
They overran our defenses
Myself and a few men are all
that’s left from Anglia
GUY
We fared only slightly better
Theyre unstoppable

Suddenly distant crashing echoes Theyre coming

OLIVER
Men-at-Arms Prepare

EXT FOREST RIVER - NIGHT

A mighty oak tree crashes to the forest floor Vampirics
chopping down one tree after another

EXT THE CITADEL —- NIGHT

KNIGHTS sharpen their swords ARCHERS prepare their bows
WOODEN STAKES made from the TRUE CROSS are portioned out

OLIVER
There are only so many to go
around Make every one count
He sees HUGH heading off towards the Watch House
EXT FOREST RIVER - NIGHT
REAPERS cross the river dragging the fallen trees behind

them constructing a bridge The Reapers -- standing high
up on their metal stilts -- are safe from the water below

EXT WATCH HOUSE - NIGHT - SAME
HUGH leads MARCELA towards the Citadel

As they walk she hears a VOICE INSIDE HER HEAD ALEXIUS

ALEXIUS (OVER)
Marcela

INTERCUT WITH
VAMPIRIC ARMY marches across the makeshift tree bridge
ALEXIUS stands on the bridge thoughts drifting
ALEXIUS (OVER)
your work is done my love
Come and be by my side

MARCELA pulls involuntarily away from HUGH Fighting him

HUGH
What is it Whats wrong

ALEXIUS (OVER)
be by my side

MARCELA
No No I will not

She clutches her head His will is tearing her apart Hugh
fights to bring her back under control calming her down

HUGH
Its all right Stay with me
Stay with me
Marcela looks at Hugh teary-eyed Scared But calm
Alexius senses that he’s losing her He looks down at the
river below Sees his wavering reflection in the moonlit
water Except their is no reflection

He then stares into the distance Eyes burning with hate

EXT THE CITADEL —- NIGHT

Everyone keeping vigilant watch Suddenly DOZENS OF KNIGHTS
-- all dressed in the Templar armor -- emerge from the forest
-- running stumbling towards the Citadel

KNIGHTS and ARCHERS scramble into position

DEODAT
Archers Take aim

ARCHERS draw their bows back taking aim

CHARLES
Wait Those are our men

DEODAT
Yes but how do we know which side
they’re on They could be infected
CHARLES
Do you suggest we slaughter our own
men

Confusion ensues Archers look at one another for answers

ARCHER
Who are they Do we shoot

OLIVER runs up the steps barking out orders --

OLIVER
Switch to mirrored sightings

ARCHER
But we cant see a thing

OLIVER
Leave that to me

He races along the wall-walk behind the battlements

ARCHERS clip on TELESCOPIC MIRROR SIGHTINGS The sighting
reflects the target off small mirrors into the Archer’s eye

OLIVER fires off MANGANESE FIREWORKS -- medieval flares --
FWOOM FWOOM FWOOM Bright twinkling sparks rain down
illuminating the night sky for a brief few seconds

ARCHERS target TEMPLARS in their mirrored sights --
VARIOUS ARCHERS POV KNIGHTS IN TEMPLAR ARMOR

We see the magnified images of Templars They appear normal

All casting reflections Not infected So far so good
ARCHERS POV A TEMPLAR KNIGHT

THE KNIGHT within the armor DISAPPEARS NO REFLECTION in
the mirrors The empty armor walks towards them Eerie

ARCHER
Got one

He fires A HOLY CROSS-BOLT hits the knight He screams
and explodes in a plume of ASH Empty armor chain mail
and weapon collapsing to the ground

Archers scan picking up MORE EMPTY SUITS OF ARMOR They
take them down Mounds of ash litter the battlefield

IN THE TRENCHES

GARIN sees his older brother WILL Overjoyed he leaps
from the trenches and runs to him Will just stares at him

GARIN
Will You made it Brother

AN ARCHERS SCOPE falls across Will Hes just an empty
suit of armor Hes infected We see Garin standing next
to him oblivious of the unseen danger

Will lunges at Garin -- blood lust in his eyes -- WHAM
He suddenly explodes in a cloud of ash Garin in shock

The battlefield is now empty Non-infected Templars now
safely inside the Citadel HUGH runs up the steps

DEODAT
Is that all

LUC lays a hand on Hugh’s shoulders Nods to the distance
He then loads up crossbow with a HOLY CROSS-BOLT and takes
aim at the tree line No movement Nothing Then

A LONE KNIGHT emerges from the black forest
LUC fires -- PFFFFFFFT The bolt grazes the side of the

KNIGHT’S FACE and skewers a VAMPIRIC -- just as hes about
to stick him with its sword lLucs real target

THE KNIGHT looks behind him Horror He runs as --
THOUSANDS OF VAMPIRIC WARRIORS erupt from the forest
Our Knight runs but they kill him feasting on his blood
HUGH
Front line into position
(to Luc points to
the tower)

I want you up there

Luc nods and takes off His quivers filled with arrows

We see VAMPIRICS running across the battlefield like a dark
swarm of locusts -- completely encircling the CITADEL

HUGH
Fire Fire

ARCHERS and CROSSBOWMEN positioned all around the Citadel
take aim and fire Volleys of HOLY CROSS-BOLTS rain down
and SCORES OF VAMPIRICS COMBUST INTO ASH But they
still keep coming looming closer

GREGORY ready to give the signal shoots Hugh a look

HUGH
Wait Let ‘em get closer

DOWN IN THE TRENCHES

The Vampirics are almost on top of them This is suicide
Templars grow nervous Oliver takes notice

OLIVER
Stand your ground

UP ON THE BATTLEMENTS
Hugh still watching waiting then nods Now

GREGORY
Raise the barricade

TEMPLARS turn wheels and levers pulling multiple lines of
ROPE taut We see lines of rope -- buried underneath the
earth -- suddenly RISE UP pulling up --

DOZENS AND DOZENS OF LARGE WOODEN CROSSES

A chain-link fence of crucifixes spring up ringing the
entire Citadel A spiritually protective barricade

Vampirics scream trying to stop As some run past the
BARRICADE OF CROSSES they burst into ash Some stop in
time only losing a limb or two

The crucifix barrier holds the Vampiric Army at bay

TEMPLARS let out a collective cheer And sighs of relief

HUGH
Hit ‘em now Holy fire

ARCHERS load up cross-bolts tipped with GLASS VIALS filled
with OIL A manganese charge and wick attached to it A
crucifix engraved on the glass Wicks are lit They fire

A LETHAL BARRAGE OF FIERY CROSS-BOLTS rain down on the other
side of the CRUCIFIX BARRICADE

» and detonate on impact EXPLODING LIKE NAPALM Dousing
Vampirics in Holy Fire Hundreds burn colliding into one
another setting each other ablaze

INT THE CITADEL CRYPT - SAME

Marcela chained to a wall In the dark except for a single
flickering candle Suddenly her eyes snap open Fearful

EXT FOREST - NIGHT
ALEXIUS looks out at the battle raging ahead then at Visago

ALEXIUS
End this Now No mercy

Visago nods then leads the VAMPIRICS into battle
Alexius closes his eyes Thoughts drifting
INT THE CITADEL CRYPT — SAME

Marcela screams Agonized pain Holding her head Tears
flowing Fighting Alexius voice inside her head

ALEXIUS (OVER)
Marcela Now is the time
Do what must be done
Marcela screams She can’t fight it anymore She pushes
down on her THUMB harder and harder until we HEAR a
SICKENING CRACK as it dislocates
EXT BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT

VISAGO leads THE VAMPIRIC CAVALRY -- riding at full gallop --
dragging WHEELED BATTERING RAMS behind them

EXT THE CITADEL BATTLEMENTS - NIGHT

HUGH sees them coming Not good He turns to Gregory

HUGH
Ready the horses

EXT BATTLEFIELD —- NIGHT

As the Vampiric riders approach the crucifix barricade they
unhook the chains disengaging them from the horses

-and the BATTERING RAMS roll on like cruise missiles
Plowing through their own warriors and tearing through the
BARRICADE OF CROSSES Timbers fly The chain is broken
The floodgates open VAMPIRICS attack

IN THE TRENCHES

Oliver leaps up onto the battlefield sword raised high

OLIVER
God wills it

Templars let out a bloodcurdling BATTLE CRY and attack
EXT THE CITADEL BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT

The gates open HUGH and TEMPLARS ride out into battle
aiding their brethren killing Vampirics

HUGH hacks and slashes PETE kicks a Vampiric knocking it
backwards -- impaling it on the sharpened remains of a CROSS

A VAMPIRIC attacks a Templar OLIVER jumps in and chops
its head off He extends the Templar helping hand

He sees a nasty bite on the Templars neck His eyes already
starting to DARKEN Before the wounded Templar can react
Oliver raises his sword

OLIVER
God forgive me

And decapitates him Oliver crosses himself
DOMINIQUE skewers TWO VAMPIRICS with his arm shiv Detaches
it and locks in a NEW ONE Someone bumps him from behind

Dominique spins around sword raised

» but its ARNAUD Battle scarred A bloody sword in
each hand Breathing heavy A distant look in his eyes

DOMINIQUE
Arnaud

He sees ARNAUDS REFLECTION in his bloodied blade Arnaud
nods Dominique sighs relief

UP IN THE TOWER
Luc fires arrows picking off Vampirics with deadly accuracy
ON THE BATTLEFIELD

We see TEMPLARS bitten and left behind now RISE UP
returning from the dead joining the ranks of the undead

ARNAUD
Theyre overrunning our defenses
We must close the gates
Hugh sees his men Outnumbered dying Some running back
towards the Citadel fighting all the way But Hugh has no
choice He has to He rides motioning

HUGH
Fall back Everyone fall back

OLIVER
You eard ‘im Fall back

Templars heed the call falling back Backpedaling across
the drawbridge as it’s pulled up Gates closing

Hugh sees CHARLES running Hes not gonna make it Their
eyes meet Charles nods He knows And its okay

INTEXT THE CITADEL GATES - NIGHT

As the gates slam shut Hugh cringes Devastated
OLIVER
Nothing you can do Theyre in
Gods hands now

With that they enter barring the doors with wooden beams

EXT AT THE CITADELS OUTER WALLS - NIGHT

The Citadel is now an island

CHARLES leads DEODAT and the last few remaining Templars
back towards the Citadel Vampirics on their ass

CHARLES
Everyone follow me

He jumps Everyone jumps down into the moat avoiding
the wooden stakes Everyone wading in chest-high water

Some Vampirics jump in after them Big mistake As they hit
the water they burn The moat is filled with Holy Water

Burning Vampirics try climbing their way out but Templars
pull them back down the Holy Water SCALDING THEM

CUT TO

A FIGURE in BLACK FLOWING ROBES moves with alien-like
stealth And lightning fast Its VISAGO

He spins like a whirlwind -- robes unfurling -- flinging
DOZENS OF RAZOR STARS in all directions THK-THK-THK
Templars and civilian militia fall dead

VISAGO runs leaps -- clears the moat and latches onto the
wall Using his claw-like fingers he starts climbing

VAMPIRICS follow him They jump clinging to the Citadels
stone walls Begin scaling the walls like spiders

UP ON THE BATTLEMENTS
Hugh peers over the side sees them getting closer

HUGH
Now

CAULDRONS OF HOT GARLIC OIL ARE OVERTURNED

As the HOLY GARLIC OIL pours -- its IGNITED with a torch --
setting the VAMPIRICS ABLAZE Burning them off the walls

They fall splashing down in the moat below burning Some
IMPALED on stakes Others hang on still ON FIRE They
continue climbing up walls as their FLESH BURNS OFF

A wave of bubbling oil splashes over Visago BURNING the
side of his face off Melted skin hanging Disgusting

But Visago hangs on He pulls off another arm robe WHIPS
it skyward The other end of the robe SNAPS around the
neck of a TEMPLAR who’s about to dump more oil

Inside the robe a COILED RAZOR WIRE The wire GARROTES
the Templar Visago pulls yanking him off the battlement
The vat of hot oil TIPS OVER -- spilling everywhere Oil
splashes a lit torch Flames flash engulfing TEMPLARS
VAMPIRICS climb up the walls and over the battlements

-- and pour into the Citadel

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALLS

Vampirics begin dumping DEAD TEMPLARS into the moat piling
them up Building a bridge of dead bodies

We see ALEXIUS riding towards the Citadel
INT CITADEL GREAT HALL - SAME

The doors SHUDDER as Vampirics assail it We hear the
sounds of hatchets CHOPPING through the boarded-up windows

GREGORY
The walls have been breached

Suddenly glass SHATTERS as Vampiric arms claw through the
windows reaching out Trying to get in

OLIVER
This is Gods house And you
shall not enter

Oliver CHOPS OFF the arms He takes them all on He’s been
cut and stabbed but he keeps fighting Unstoppable

ELYAS and GREGORY fend off Vampirics slashing mercilessly

DOMINIQUE skewers a Vampiric with his arm shiv then uses
the dead body as SHIELD as he fends off other Vampirics

LUC using two swords SCISSORS OFF a Vampiric’s head
Templars fight but its an increasingly hopeless situation
OLIVER
(to Hugh)
Go The Grail must be protected
Hugh hesitates Oliver grabs him
OLIVER
And it is for nothing if the blood
of our Lord is not safe GO
Hugh nods Hes right Hugh runs
CUT TO

ARNAUD thrusts his sword into a Vampirics mouth With a
flick of his wrist he severs the head in half Suddenly --

VISAGO appears Half of his face is missing

ARNAUD
(looking Visago over)
I’m going to need some help here

LUC steps up He and Arnaud slowly circle around Visago
Sizing each other up Two on one But Visago could care
less He unsheathes two swords twirling them

VISAGO
You do not deserve our immortality

Together they attack Visago Swords swinging Sparks
flash Metal clangs Insane Intense Violent Blink
and youre dead The three expert swordsmen battle it out

INT CITADEL CRYPT - SAME

Hugh enters the darkened crypt He pulls out the BIBLE
in it the silver box The last vial

SOMEONE MOVES FROM THE SHADOWS --

Before Hugh can react the unseen attacker charges --
DAGGER in hand -- swipes SLICING his hand Nasty gash
Hugh recoils in pain In the dim light he sees
MARCELA Standing there crazed look in her eyes A tense
beat She looks at the blood-stained dagger in her hands
Guilty Then tears begin flowing

Suddenly she attacks him again -- fighting the VOICES in
her head -- hate burning in her eyes hate mixed with tears

Hugh grabs her disarms her She weeps uncontrollably

MARCELA
I’m sorry Forgive me

INT THE CITADEL - SAME
Visago picks up a DEAD KNIGHT’S BODY and hurls it The

flying body slams Arnaud into the wall Hard Arnaud
lies stuck underneath the heavy armor Hurting

Visago twirls -- RAZOR STARS flying Luc spins -- whirling
his sword -- deflecting stars Sparks flash But two razor
stars get through -- sticking Luc He’s down

ARNAUD lying in pain sees a WHIPSYCTHE attached to the
dead Knight slumped on top of him He grabs it cracks

the whip -- and LASSOS Visagos ankles
Startled Visago looks down sees the whipsycthe blade
embedded into his ankles He’s hooked

He looks at Arnaud clawed finger wagging Tsk tsk
ARNAUD
(smiles)

No one lives forever

And pulls The blade SEVERS VISAGOS FEET at the ankles

Visagos body BURNS as he crumples to the floor No matter
where he moves no matter what he touches -- his body BURNS

VISAGOs FEET have been severed No soil to protect him from
standing on hallowed ground He screams as he turns to ash

ARNAUD
If you can’t sever the head go
for the feet

Templars heed the advice -- and SEVER Vampirics legs off
They fall to ground SCREAMING in pain as they burn

EXT CITADEL - NIGHT
ALEXIUS walks over the bridge of dead bodies
INT CITADEL - NIGHT

One Vampiric crawls towards the CITADEL DOORS trying to
get off HOLY GROUND Oliver walks over grinning

OLIVER
No you don’t mate

And thrusts his sword PINNING IT to the floor
Suddenly the main doors BLOW OPEN And ALEXIUS enters

ARNAUD attacks -- but ALEXIUS throws his sword skewering
Arnaud in the chest He falls down dead

OLIVER draws a handheld CROSSBOW loaded with a precious
HOLY CROSS-BOLT Takes aim

OLIVER
The devil will be vanquished

Alexius leaps a jumping knee kick -- striking Oliver in the
throat Oliver crashes to the floor As Alexius lands he
PUNCHES his fist through Oliver’s armor deep into his chest

Oliver gasps Alexius leans in staring watching the life
drain from Olivers eyes He then pulls his fist out
licking the blood from his hand

FROM THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS ABOVE

Dawn breaks Tiny rays of sunlight creep in through the
windows The Vampirics cower retreating to the shadows

Alexius looks at them with disgust Cowards
INT CITADEL SUNKEN PRAYER AREA - SAME
As Hugh leads Marcela she pulls away from him Fearful

MARCELA
He’s here You must go

She retreats to a dark corner

HUGH then notices that everything is suddenly QUIET He
clasps his crucifix quietly reciting The Lord’s Prayer

He looks up sees ALEXIUS standing at the top Alexius
leaps crushing a row of pews As he rises the PEWS scatter
like leaves smashing to splinters against the far walls

As Alexius steps towards Hugh he carefully sidesteps the
shafts of sunlight

ALEXIUS
And as much as I enjoy our reunion
here in God’s house I must ask

you for his son’s blood

HUGH
(raises his sword
high guard position)
You live life by taking the lives
of others It ends now

Alexius attacks Hugh blocks him Here we go again

The two adversaries go at it Swordplay at its finest

Hugh kicks Alexius -- knocking him backwards through thin
RAYS OF SUNLIGHT -- singing his exposed hands That stung
Alexius recovers swings -- Hugh steps back -- the very tip

of Alexius BLADE severs the chain of Hugh’s Crucifix --
just missing his jugular The crucifix flies off as do

The two gold wedding bands They roll away

Hugh grabs his throat feeling naked Alexius smiles

ALEXIUS
Where is your faith now You can end
this The pain the suffering the
bloodshed Just give me what I want

HUGH
Never I’11 never give it to you
The Grail is for only the worthy

Alexius grabs a LANCE -- armed with dozens of smaller blades
chained to the staff Alexius twirls the lance -- whipping
the chained blades -- like a spinning propeller

Hugh blocks the blows but the whirling blades SEVER his
sword in half -- slashing his legs Alexius kicks Hugh
launching him backwards knocking him against the far wall

Hugh lands hard on impact his broken sword clatters next
to him and spilling out of his armor

THE LAST VIAL

It skitters across the stone floor and rolls to a stop
right underneath a pool of light Hugh smiles weakly

Alexius walks towards the vial -- carefully sidestepping the
growing laser beam shafts of daylight He stands before it
Pondering He then extends a hand to Marcela

Under his will Marcela walks over to him She then bends
down and picks up THE VIAL for him burning her hand Flesh
sizzling Ignoring the pain she hands it to Alexius

ALEXIUS
Ah true love

He looks at the vial in his gloved hand Smiles Victory
Suddenly A CROSSBOW clatters next to HUGH thrown by
ELYAS

Hugh grabs the crossbow loaded ready to go

ALEXIUS reacts all too late

Hugh has got him dead bang Pulls the trigger THE HOLY
CROSS-BOLT FIRES And hits Alexiuss shoulder The bolt

glances off the armor

Hugh -- devastated -- his world collapsing He failed
Alexius laughs VAMPIRICS gather above looking down at
their leader in his moment of triumph

ALEXIUS
To a world forever in darkness We
shall not be slaves to any God or

his sons I shall rule this world
(to Marcela)
With my queen

Marcela steps to Alexius’ side As Alexius raises the vial
to smash it MARCELA KISSES HIM Passionate Alexius
submits to her This is what he has always wanted

Hugh looks up praying for help He stares at the stained
glass windows above Various religious images -- Christ on
the Cross -- Mary Magdalen weeping -- The Crown of Thorns --
Alexius’ defenses down he doesn’t realize that MARCELA has
edged him back into a BEAM OF LIGHT -- which SEARS OFF HIS
ARM -- the one holding the vial

The vial falls

Hugh scrambles fingers reaching for it

Alexius severed arm and hand falls and hits the floor
-- WHOOSH It turns to ash The vial falls and lands
the mound of ash softening the impact

It doesnt shatter

Hugh sighs relief He then presses a button on the HILT of
his broken sword releasing the SMALL DAGGER

Alexius throws Marcela off of him He looks at her Tears
of hurt and betrayal in his eyes Speechless

Hugh hurls the dagger It smashes through the window

A BRIGHT SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT shines through like a laser

The remaining Templars pick up weapons helmets debris --
anything -- and throw them at the stained glass windows As

glass shatters -- SHAFTS OF SUNLIGHT flood the room

Prisms of light BURNS Alexius One BURNS OFF his other arm
Another BISECTS his legs Dissecting him Piece by piece

Alexius falls to the floor A ray of sunlight burns through
his head and Alexius’s remains turn to ASH

The surviving Vampirics suddenly look LOST Leaderless

The controlling voice in their head GONE They withdraw
looking for shadows As SUNLIGHT fills the Citadel they
start to BURN turning to ASH

And with Alexius gone MARCELA looks like she has been freed
Hugh takes her by the hand leads her down into the crypt
Into the safety of darkness

EXT CITADEL - DAWN

Vampirics run for the dark forests Most TURN TO ASH as
they run Some make it where they hide in the shadows

Templars give chase taking down the rest
EXT CITADEL BATTLEFIELD - MOMENTS LATER
HUGH with ELYAS and LUC supporting him walks outside with
the rest of the surviving Templars CHARLES and DEODAT
climb up out of the moat exhausted but still alive
Together they lift their swords in triumph and CHEER
EXT CITADEL - NIGHT
FUNERAL PYRES have been erected for OLIVER ARNAUD and many
others killed in battle Hugh stops at Oliver’s pyre Says
a quiet prayer Others look on saddened

Goodbye my old friend God will

look after you now

FUNERAL PYRES BURN as far as the eye can see

DISSOLVE TO

Marcela stands in the shadows Dawn’s first light She
feels the suns warmth Hugh approaches her

HUGH
You are free my love
MARCELA
My soul is free But I am not of
this world I died long ago

HUGH
No we are together again

She gently places her hand on his face Looks into his eyes
We SEE something in her eyes A flicker of the Vampiric
instinct still there

MARCELA
We will be together again

A beat Then she kisses him A soft lingering kiss
She touches their wedding bands around his neck smiles

MARCELA
Remember me I am forever yours

She steps toward the sunlight but Hugh holds onto her hand
not wanting to let go

Sunlight starts to burn her body She succumbs to it With
each step more of her body slowly turns to ash

MARCELA
I love you

her hand slips from Hugh’s

She turns to look at Hugh Smiles Her radiant face is the
last to turn to ash

Hugh weeps quietly
