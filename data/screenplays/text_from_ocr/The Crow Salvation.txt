Accurately patiently wielded

INT MYSTERY ROOM - DIMNESS

X-CLOSE A SCALPEL returned to its place in a neat array
of TAXIDERMY TOOLS Long surgical TWEEZERS taken A steady
HAND grasps a CLAY BIRD FORM Then sets the second eye
Unhurried Meticulous

A MYSTERY MAN features obscured sets the tweezers aside
reaches for a black lump on the table revealed to be shiny
feathers as he wraps it around the form Adjusts it so the
glass eyes peer out through holes in the skin of this large
CROW A taxidermy specimen

X-WIDE THE WALLS like a medieval castle above a throng
of PROTESTERS and GAWKERS A POSTCARD at first then signs
of movement--handheld placards and flickering candles
telegraph an imminent execution

The group shifts amoeba like as A LARGE MERCEDES
approaches slowly works its way into the edge of the crowd

looks up in terror at the bodies pressed against the car

RANDALL

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD--a Protestors poster visible
Remember the Victim With a picture of LAUREN RANDALL
the deceased who bears a striking resemblance to surviving
sister Erin And another sign--Happy Birthday Alex

ERIN

She takes a deep breath they get out of the car and

Dead Man Walking A mini parade past the cells of the
condemned One guard flanks Alex another follows The
Warden and Minister out in front

HANDS extend from the other cells as Alex passes Unable

entourage enters and begins a surprisingly well
choreographed last dance

The Warden gestures and Alex is escorted to his place in

a sea of hostile faces settling on Erin and her dad

ALEX
I loved Lauren I still do Im

Erin shakes her head disgusted Looks away

ALEXS POV - THE LAST SECONDS OF HIS LIFE SLOWING in his
inner perception movement ramping down as Alex scans the
disbelieving faces

The Phone Silent No reprise The Observation Room witness
door opens A Guard in the back row deferentially offers
his seat to the NEW ARRIVAL a man in dark clothes his
face obscured by REFLECTIONS in the plexiglass As he
UNBUTTONS his shirt cuff

The warden steps to the side of the room nods to the
executioner who lifts a COVER off a large switch

The New Arrival pulls his shirtsleeve back over his forearm
exposing a scar for Alex THE SCAR an odd zigzag pattern
of raised welts a pattern deliberately formed of skin

The Executioner throws the switch ON ALEX SHAKING violently
as he fights to stay alive time extremely subjective now
as he chokes out

ALEX (CONTD)
(indistinct filtered)
Murderer

The word bubbles up as if from underwater audible only to
Alex Alex wrenches his head a superhuman act of will
trying to ID the Scar Man through the reflections

THE HELMET starts to smoke Then a burst of FLAME at Alexs
head
A BOTCHED EXECUTION made worse by Alexs struggle to see
to stay alive

IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM The observers panic horrified
Only the Scar Man calm as he covers his arm rebuttons his
shirt Face always obscured

onto the floor Gropes a few seconds on hands and knees
before a SHADOW passes over him evoking a primitive
response He cowers looks up at

A LARGE CROW flutters through the bars of a high window
lands near him on the floor It looks at him then flaps

its way up to the autopsy countertop cocks its head Follow
me

ALEX strains to pull himself up on the gurney that brought
him here

HIS POV as he slowly rises above the gurney--the Crow in
front of a mirror over the splash sink It flies off
revealing Alexs reflection Charred Hideous

ALEX drops back to the floor with a SCREAM Turns sees
himself in a stainless door and SMASHES it with his fist

THE BASHED STAINLESS DOOR the word MORGUE painted on
the wall behind Alex brought into focus at the center of
the concavity ALEX thrashes trying to avoid his
reflection but the dim mirrors have him surrounded

THE CROW flaps down crazed too as if in empathy CAWING
loudly finally getting Alexs attention ALEX settles
hazards another look at his reflection in stainless steel

His body looks less misshapen now He looks at his arms
hands no longer burned Pulls himself up on the gurney
again cautiously

OVER ALEX as he slowly rises above the gurney a second
time looks in the mirror His body miraculously HEALED
covered by shredded clothing

His face obscured by the meltdown helmet He slowly
approaches the mirror on unsteady feet

reflection)

What happened

Alex starts to tear away the helmet and gets a first
frightening FLASH as his fingers touch it

darkly

RESUME -ALEX clutching the helmet on his head ripping it
