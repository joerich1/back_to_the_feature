The Witching Hour

Screenplay by ANNE RICE

FADE IN
EXT A SCOTTISH MOOR - NIGHT - 1670 AD

Far off a massive stone castle looms Trees silhouetted an

the horizon against the star-dotted qreen-purple sky The branches of one
tree seem to reach

for the stars

TRACKING IN - the tree is A HOODED FIGURE SUZANNE - 20 golden hair
spilling from her hood

dazzling green eyes Nestled in the folds of her cloak is DEBORAH - 5
scarlet curls green

eyes glowing She peeks up at the bizarre sky

DEBORAH (a thick Scottish accent)
Mum - Im so scared Look at the color

SUZANNE (a thick Scottish accent)
(entranced soothing)
Deborah be still And listen
(a beat in a chant)
Wind you are a thousand eyes - but never seen
A thousand caresses - but never touched A
thousand voices - but never a word Always with me

never 2e2ee
DEBORAH
(fearful)
Mum Oh Mum God will surely strike us -
SUZANNE

Wind - I love you with that which is endless
within me Bring me your eyes - your touch -
your voice

A WIND gathers force The grass sways Leaves twirl

SUZANNE
Send me your soul Come to me NOW

The ferocious WIND HOWLS Trees bend The sky darkens SUZANNES hood is
whipped of her

head A dagger of LIGHTNING cuts the sky open Then - a sound like a HOWL
of birth

A VOICE
(melodic wondrous)
Suzanne the door is open Call me Bring
me to you with a name
SUZANNE
(ecstatic shouting above the ROAR)
For the wind that lashes the trees that brings
you to your lover You are --- Lasher LASHER

THUNDER rocks her to the ground Rain pours down

VOICE
I am through my love I have come
(a beat joyful)
Lasher

SUZANNE thrusts her arms out as if to embrace the wind DEBORAH peeks out
from her mothers
cloak She looks at the ground - wide-eyed - and reaches out

ECU - DEBORAHS CLENCHED FIST
The tiny fist opens - a NUGE EMERALD glistens in her palm

FADE TO BLACK FADE UP TO
DAY ECU - THE CURVED RUNNER OF A ROCKING CHAIR

Rocking on a wooden floor A large horned beetle skitters INTO FRAME -
antenna flicking

Above it the chairs runner reaches its highest point - descends --- and
just misses it

WOMANS VOICE (OC)
(a southern accent cool)
Do you see the lillies Deedee Big as soup ladles

TILT UP to a pale hand on the chair-arm inside a faded pink sleeve - and UP
to

ECU - A FACE SKOCKING IN ITS MELANCHOLY VISAGE

A WOMAN - 50 a gaunt shattered beauty Not a flicker in her green eyes
Her hair is stringy

- in need of a wash

ANGLE - THE PORCH OF A LARGE GOTHIC MANSION

CARLOTTA MAYFAIR - 80 cane in hand rocks DIEDRE MAYFAIR on the porch Her
white hair is

pulled back severely Skin tight on her skull Green eyes keen and focused

The house was magnificent - once Tall columnsStained glass But it is
a dying house
Rotted wood Peeling paint You can almost hear it wheeze

ANGLE - THE GADEN BEYOND THE PORCH

Thick Lush Huge flowers flourish A flagstone walk leads to a swimming
pool filled with

brackish water and lily pads A wrought-iron fence encircles the grounds on
the other side

the street seems like another world

BACK TO CARLOTTA AND DIEDRE ON THE PORCH CARLOTTA takes a syringe from a bag
and injects
DIEDRE who shows no reaction CARLOTTA feels her pulse

CARLOTTA
We numb the body and the mindbut we havent found
a needle yat that can prick your soul That belongs to
him
doesnt it my beautitul Deedee

A BREEZE suddenly rises The trees and long grass stir CARLOTTA smiles
privately - and

surveys the garden Something there for a moment behind the waving
branches

BEYOND THE WROT-IRON FENCE

A MAN - 60 white suit fedora and an ivory walking stick - comes down the
sidewalk He tips

his hat to the women and walks on CARLOTTA watches him go

CARLOTTA
(dry caustic)
Well well Deedee Both your admirers have paid a
call

CARLOTTA looks down at the huge beetle -- and crushes it with her shoe The
BREEZE dies The

trees come to rest But DIEDRES hair still flutters as if stroked by a
loving hand

INT ECU - A PAIR OF HANDS REST ATOP AN IVORY WALKING STICK

The sticks top is carved into a pair of angels wings The left hand wears
an ivory ring -
with a gold T set in it

MANS VOICE (OC)
(an English accent calm sonorous
Diedre was silent - still - as always

TILT UP to AARON LIGHTNER (the white-suited Man who strolled past the Mayfair
mansion)

AARON
but there is no question about it she is dying

WIDE OF SCENE - A MAGNIFICENT SITTING ROOM

AARON stands at a mahogany table where a dozen MEN and Women - ages 25
to 60 elegantly

dressed - sit and exchange sober locks at his pronouncement They all wear
the same ring

AARON
(taps his chest lightly)
Her vibrations were unmistakable I felt them quite
clearly
(sighs)
Strange to think after thirty yearsI shall walk by
the porch
and find the chair empty

WOMAN AT THE TABLE
What of the child Aaron

AARON
The childs life will take its inevitable turn
(pause) we
will watch and wait and soon - our waiting will be
over

INT CLOSE-UP - A PAIR OF WHITE DOORS

In bold letters EMEAGENCY ONLY - KEEP CLEAR

The doors fly open - PARAMEDICS barrel through pushing a gurney with a
bleeding WOMAN We

TRACK behind it A WOMAN suddenly races INTO FRAME into the gurneys path
The gurney veers off

- but we fallow the WOMAN

in the BOYS skull Deeper Deeper And suddenly - blood spurts

ROWAN

A srnall pressure gauge is handed to her She screws it into the BOYS skull
Takes a reading

ROWAN

As action goes on all around her she steps back - and seems to take a breath
for the first time
since she entered

ROWAN
(softly to no one in particular)
Hell be okay

INT A HOSPITAL SCRUB ROOM MINUTES LATER

ROWAN washes at a sink She looks up to her retlection in the mirror A
strange look - hard
to decipher NURSE 1 enters untying her bloody smock She grins

EXT THE PACIFIC OCEAN DAY
A sailboat drifts lazily on the flat water - its sails limp in the windless

sky San Francisco
looms in the BG
ANGEL - ON THE SAILBOATS DECK

ROWAN - in sweater and shorts - looks at the sky searching for wind and
frowns She strips

down to a bikini stretches out on the deck and points her face to the sun

EXT THE SAN FRANSISCO COAST - A JETTY LATER THAT DAY

MICHAEL sits out on the rocks sketching a house on a pad the WIND picks
up the surrounding

waters turn choppy He draws his collar up A seagull lands near him
MICHAEL starts

sketching the gull

MICHAEL
The soaring larks lift up aloft with them the sky that
to our
shoulders was heavy (grins) YOU like Rilke

The bird starts preening A wave smacks against the rocks spraying MICHAEL
He looks around

at the sea and frowns The WIND tugs at him Another wave sprays him He
rises

MICHAEL
Dame weatherman said -

The gull SCREECHES - and suddenly takes off - coming right at him MICHAEL
ducks out of the

way slips on the slippery surface - and falls His head strikes the rocks
A wave pounds the

jetty and sweeps him into the sea

MICHAEL

falling in the water Losing ccnsciousness Being swept out to tea His
eyes closing hes

going under - Sinking

BENEATH THE SEA

MICHAEL floats downward A stream at bubbles squirts from his mouth then
they stop MOVE IN

to his peaceful face IN TIGHTER - into his closed eyes - and through them

POV - SPEEDING THROUGH A BLACK NIGHT SKY WITH A ZILLION STARS

A fierce ROARING Hair-pin ttrrns around stars - the cosmic Daytona 500
Racing toward a huge

white-hot star SMASHING through into - SILENCE Freefalling through the
richest thickest

GREEN imaginable

en seeping out off the GREEN PHANTOMS -

apeless - but the GREENESS is giving them form SUZANNE with the emerald

suspended above a vast BLACKNESS phantoms all around him And MICAEL
starts floating down

toward it

SUZANNE
Michael - NO Go Back

EXT ROWANA SAILBOAT IN THE OCEAN

ROWAN is asleep on the deck The sea is choppy A sudden gust fills the
mainsail It swings
across the deck CRACK ROWAN wakes and rises delighted

ROWAN
Alright A little speed

she starts pulling in the mainsail - stops and squints- Something is out
there in the waves-
She dives into the sea bobbing up to take a look every few strokes

Now shes reaching out --- grabbing MICHAELs lifeless body Her arm slings
round him - now
shes backstroking one-armed

They reach the boat- she grabs the rope ladder - and with remarkable
strength - pulls him up
ey sprawl on the deck

She rips his shirt open - pressing her ear to his chest Cursing she starts
mouth-to-mouth

Nothing- switching to CPR - pressing down on his chest - rhythmically
forcefully-

ROWAN
one - two - three - four - five-

To fifteen Nothing- she grabs his face - and slaps him

ROWAN
Breathe goddamnit-
(slaps him again)
BREATHE

She starts on his chest again - her pumping is violent now
ROWAN

Youre not - (pump) - gonna - (pump)
- DIE - (pump) - you sonuvabitch
nothing- Shee slumps back- Gasping fury rising- suddenly she rises on
her knees - raises

a fist - and brings it down - striking his chest with all her might- And
MICHAELs body jerks

eerily water spurts from his south A rasping cough erupts from him And
his eyes open

MICHAEL
(hacking- mumbling)
They - they wanted me to come back

And his eyes close Out cold She nods exhausted - and strokes the matted
hair from the gash

on his forehead- then - cocking her head staring intently at him - the
manner of her gesture

changes - her fingers slide down his cheek --- almost a caress

EXT ROWANS SAILBOAT AT SEA LATER

ROWAN stands motionless at the railing a blanket wrapped round her -
watching MICHAEL on a

stretcher being taken below on the Coast Guard cruiser alongside her boat
It speeds off

ROWAN watches until she cant see it anymore-

INT A HOSPITAL - THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

concern--

fire engine

MICHAEL cocks his head and with a dreamy look he stands

INT AN ATTIC MINUTES LATER

MICHAEL gloved and wobbly digs through dusty boxes His face softens -
and he pulls out an

old singed Firemans helmet with the insignia N0 17 He lays it down -
hesitates - pulls

his gloves off reaches out with his hands --- and grabes the helmet

A SEARING FLASH OF WHITE AND A ROAR

INT A FIERY FLAMING BUILDINGG AS IF MICHAEL WERE THERE
A FIREMAN - his helmet labelled NO 17 - races to an open window vith a GIRL
in his arms

Down in the street - other FIREMEN buffeted by a strong wind look up
holding a satety net

The FIRMAN tosses the child down to safety Suddenly - the window is blown
in shattering

The FIREMAN falls to the floor - cut and dazed Above hirn - the flames
dance - and then

everything comes down on top of him-

BACK TO MICHAEL IN THE ATTIC
as he is jolted to the floor one hand grasping the helmet

EXT - A TREE-LINED STREET AS IF MICHAEL WERE THERE

A battalion of FIREMWN at attention as PALLBEARERS carry a coffin Seated at
a reviewing stand

draped with a black cloth that reads NEW ORLEANS FIRE DEPARTMENT is a WOMAN -

weeping dressed in widows black - and

A SMALL BOY (STRONGLY RESEMBLING MICHAEL)

insignia He watches

the coffin pass fascinated

THE BOYS POV

A tall wavy-haired MAN in ninteent-century garb walks solemnly beside the
coffin The
Pallbearers dont seem to notice He gives the Boy a melancholy smile

THE BOY
Pokes his Mother and points to the man But she just pats his hand solemnly
She doesnt see

BACK TO MICHAEL ON THE ATTIC FLOOR
as he drops the helmet - and weeps

INT A CHILDRENS HOSPITAL WARD DAY

Filled with KIDS Bandages casts eye patches Playing reading watching
TV ROWAN strolls

in smiles at the scene - and approaches the BOY she saved - his head

together plastic Lego pieces creating a race car

ROWAN
So - how fast does it go

BOY
(looking up smiles)
Reallll fast Seven hundred miles an hour Mmmmm

A minute

ROWAN
Wow Thats almost as fast as my car
The BOY squints at her- figuring out if shes kidding-

ANGEL - MICHAEL STANDING IN THE DOORWAY

Hes watching ROWAN He is hollow-eyed gaunt - but clean- shaven in clean
clothes ROWAN is

unaware at his presence

ROWAN
(crouches beside the BOY quite serious
Thats if I turn on the retro-burners
(pause)
Of course I only do that if rm being chased
(the BOYS eyes pop hes hooked)
Never been caught yet

She offers her palm - and he slaps her five

ROWAN
Hows your head Terry-- Feel anything - like a
balloon
in there

He shakes his head NO She affectionately rubs his cheek then rises and
beads toward the door

MICHAEL puts his gloved hands behind his back And - their alec meet
Almost palpable

electricity A long beat

MICHAEL

She nods - but her face betrays her shock at his appearance

ROWAN
Mr Curry- - -

She otters her hand He hesitates brings a gloved hand from behind his
back - and they shake
hands She watches him as he stares at the BOY

MICHAEL
They like you ------- kids

ROWAN
(smiles)
I guess so The trick is remembering how to act like
one
(a beat soberly)
Im glad you called Mr Curry I wanted to see you
(pause)
Why dont we go to my office

She gestures toward the hall He nods hesitantly - and they walk OUT OF
FRAME
INT ROWANS OFFICE MINUTES LATER

Shelves lined with texts on childrens diseases and prenatal postnatal and
infant genetics
MICHAEL stands perusing the books ROWAN sits at her desk

ROWAN
Ive read the stories - and seen the news coverage

MICHAEL
(turns to her- scowls)
Freak at the week Thats what the TV crew call
it-
(a grim smile)
people come right to the house They have a husband
or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid- They
bring
a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it so I can
teel them

where they are

Looks her straight in the eye A wave of current flows

MICHAEL
I dont remember you at all-
(pause)
You - you saved my life- Bizarre thing to say isnt
it
ROWAN
(her warm smile)
Im glad youre around to say it
MICHAEL
(dark)
My jurys still out on that
ROWAN
(turns almost sharp)
Then call it in Mr Curry Whatevers happening to you

H musters a weak smile Tugs at his gloves She rises
ROWAN

(Warm soothing)
Lets see what we can find out-

EXT A BOAT DOCK DAY - AN HOUR LATER

ROWAN and MICHAEL walk down toward her boat She glances at his gloves

ROWAN
Do they keep everything out

MICHAEL
As far as touching things yes But the vision - that
keeps
pouring into my head- (stark) It wont go away God -
if I

could just understand it

They step onto the boats deck ROWAN walks to the spot where she revived
him and kneels

ROWAN
You had no pulse- You were gone

MICHAEL - tightly-wound - kneels beside her Squeezes his eyes shut- A deep
sigh

ROWAN
Dont be afraid Michael

Her tone - and the use at his name - opens his eyes An electritied sock
between them He

peels his gloves off steels himself flattens his palms on the deck - and
waits

ROWAN
What do you see

MICHAEL
(his face is a blank)
Nothing Absolutely nothing-

EXT AN OUTDOOR DECK DAY - LATER

MICHAEL stands staring down at the dock and ROWANS boat- The ocean beyond
shimmers He turns
and walks through open glass doors inside to

A KITCHEN-LIVING ROOM AREA

Rustic unadorned Half-walled by the glass doors MICHAEL sits at a
chopping-block island

and scares at his gloved hands- ROWAN pours him a scotch and sits across
from him

ROWAN
Just one The bars closed

MICHAEL
(gulps down the drink)
The one time I want it to work

ROWAN
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts

in out-of-body -

MICHAEL
(bristles)
Youre not gonna give me the textbook analysia are you
doctor
My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-
starved
brain - and nobody -

ROWAN
No Im not
(a beat- enigmatic)
Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter
ignorance about
some things

MICHAEL nods in surprise He tries to pull a cigarette from his pack his
gloved fingers

fumbling ROWAN reaches out and stills his hand with hers She takes out a
cigarette puts it

in his lips - and lights it Their eyes lock

ROWAN

Touch me

(MICHAELS brow creases)
My hands were all over you Maybe something will come

from

me

(soft soothing)
Touch me Michael-

She holds her hands out to him He hesitate- staring at her offering He
strips off his gloves
- reaching for her hands - and takes them in his

A FLASH OF WHITE MELTS TO
EXT ON THE DECK OF THE BOAT

as ROWAN slams her fist into MICHAELS chest - and he jolts to life she
caresses his cheek in
unmistakable longing

THE IMAGE IS SUCKED THROUGH A HOLE IN ITSELF TO
INT - ROWANS KITCHENN AS IF MICHAEL WERE THERE

where a MAN - 50 in a bathrobe - lies twitching on tfle floor eyes glazing
into death- ROWAN
is crouched beside him weeping fists clenched mumbling Graham

ROWANS VOICE (OC)
OWWWWWWW

SUDDENLY BACK TO ROWANS KITCHEN

as ROWAN - with a yelp - wrenches her hands free or MICHAELS vise girp He
tumbles backwards

onto the floor ROWAN races round to him and kneels - cradling his head
geritly
MICHAEL
(eyes opening- weakly)
My gloves

She grabs them and slips them on his hands Her lush hair is tussled by a
stadden BREEZE that
blows in from the deck

MICHAEL
(softly awestruck)
I saw it On the boat I was - dead (pause) you
brought
me back

Enongh electricity to light a city He takes her hands gently in his -

MICHAEL
with these

The BREEZE sends some papers into the air ROWAN bends to him Their lips
meet in a soft brush

or a kiss - and then the gates open Lips searching- hands tearing at
clothes Limbs

entwining A whirlwind of flesh finds a rhythm Two pounding themselves
into one- Rough

on-the-edge-

ROWAN
Harder

MICHAEL
Rowan

ROWAN
HARDER

MICHAEL

ROWAN
Ill bet you say that to all the women who bring you

back to
life and then seduce you
she rises on an elbow - with that enigmatic look

ROWAN
What else did you see- Michael

MICHAEL
(a curious grin)
Whatre you - a mindreader
(a beat turns solemn)
Who was the man on the kitchen floor

ROWANS brow knits - stunned Not what she expected

ROWAN
(stiff softly)
My uncle Graham He and my Aunt Ellie raised me
(pause)
He - he - had a stroke- Just before Ellie died - of

cancer
Last year
MICHAEL
You knelt there helpless- You couldnt save him
(pause)
There was so such anger in you- Death infuriates
you

she puts her head back down on his chest A long beat

ROWAN
Its unbelievable that you can do that

MICHAEL
(a beat turns dark
It - it feels like - like Im being filled up crowded
out of
myself (pause) Like Im fading away-

ROWAN slides up face to face Her eyes filled with warmth

ROWAN
Youre here Michael All of you

She leans in and kisses him deeply And they start again
EXT CLOSE-UP - MICHAELS FACE FLOATING UNDERWATER
- the water stretching it eerily PULL BACK to reveal

MICHAEL LYING ON HIS STOMACH ON THE DOCK - DAYTIME
his head out over the edge staring at his reflection

MICHAEL
Ive always loved them (pause) New Orleans has these
great
old houses When I was a kid Id look at them
thinking -
was nothing

He turns to ROWAN who

inside

house-

somebody dreamed them up put something where there
it amazed me
suns herself on her back on the dock

MICHAEL

My mother and I used to take long walks and make up
stories about the houses and the people who lived

(pause)
The Queens house- the Gangsters house- the clowns

Like that

ROWAN
And whose houses do you design

MICHAEL
Oh The Green underwater Ghosts The Man With The
Eyes In His Hands

ROWAN
(a beat watching him)
You still feel that crazy

He passes Then smiles and shakes his head

A long beat

MICHAEL
No Not vith you

ROWAN
I was born in New Orleans too-

MICHAEL
Really Your family there

ROWAN
Nope- My father died before I was born My mother died
in childbirth Ellie was my only blood relation so
brought me here the day after I was born

MICHAELS brow creases- He reaches out and strokes her ankle - but she sits

up pulling her

legs away from him Staring out to sea silently He stares at her back

moth

MICHAEL
Too much too fast
ROWAN
Mm-hmm (pause) Scared- I feel a little like the

and the flame
MICHAEL (a beat softly)
So do I

ROWAN
Far from it Michael Dont put me up there

She stares at him- sighs and shaking her head -

ROWAN

face creases with
concern He reactres for her - but she rises- Starts pacing

MICHAEL
Ro --- what is it

A long beat She finally turns to him -

ROWAN
What you saw --- me in the kitchen - with Grahm -

My anger wasnt frustration Michael (pause) It was
hatred
(MICHAEL winces stunned)
He tried to molest me while his wife lay half-dead in
the
hospital (pause) Ellies love was the one thing that
connected

me to the world Sha was all I ever had
(chilling)
At that moment I hated Graham with a fury you could
never imagine

(a long beat softly)
I wanted him to die (pause) Howqs that for perfect

A tear slides down her cheek- The mainsail SNAPS loudly as it fills with
WIND Her tears come

full-force sobbing she lunges into his arms Se holds her tightly A
long beat

ROWAN
(pained ashamed)

where MICHAEL stands
staring at the mess

MICHAEL
Seems more like a year than a month

ROWAN

He slowly nods Searching each others eyes Then a crooked smile curls at
ROWANS lips She
shakes her head

ROWAN
Were quite a pair you and I

MICHAEL
(matching her grin)
Mad for each other

INE A BEDROOM LATE NIGHT

Moonlight on a dusty floor DIEDRE lies motionless in an old brass bed - her
open eyes welling

with tears Her wrists and ankles in leather restraints The window

curtains flutter

CLOSE-UP - DIEDRES FACE IN THE MOONLIGHT
as a tear rolls down her cheek - then changes direction - moving across her
cheek and

disappears - as if someone had brushed it away A haunting smile blooms -
her eyes close

INT AN OPERATING ROOM

ROWAN works feverishly on an OUT OF FRAME patient Thirteen FIGURES - faces
hidden by surgical

masks - encircle the operating table - watching silently ROWAN throws her
hands up in despair

her confidence failing

ROWAN
I - I cant do it

The others urge her on - imploring encouraging her

ROWAN
(pointing OUT OF FRAM frantic)
But look LOOK How can I do it

ROWAN SHOOTS UP IN HER BED AT NIGHT

jolted awake by the rain whipping at her windows The clock says 3 AM The
rain is like a

WHISPER Every nerve-end at attention She reaches under the bed and brings
up a bat Heart

pounding Stepping into the hall reaching

THE DARKENED LIVING ROOM

The WIND MOANS The rain flows thickly down the glass walls giving the sky
and ocean beyond a

weird melted look

ROWAN
(tense - but brave)
It somebodys here ---

She whirls round There - on the deck is A MAN - wavy hair achingly
handseme Victorian

clothes - THE MAN AT THE FUNERAL PROCESSION IN MICHAELS VISION His hands
rest on the glass

The rain seems to go through him ROWAN raises the bat -

ROWAN
Ill take your goddamn head off

she dashes to the glass doors - yanks them open and steps out But the deck
is empty

Drenched she reaches out - and touches the glass where the mans hands had
been- She snatches

her hand away quickly - and stares at her fingertips incredulous

INT ROWANS KITCHEN PRE-DAWN

The storm is over ROWAN sips from a wine glass staring at her fingertips
she rubs them
together deep in thought The phone RINGS once - and the answering machine
kicks on

ROWANS VOICE (ON THE MESSAGE)

Deborah Suzannes daughter She started the family
fortune Her
plantation covered half ot Haiti

Her crooked finger stabs at another portrait a MAN - handsome black-eyed
in elegant long
coat and ruffled shirt

CARLOTTA
Julien Your great grandfather Clever charming
Julien
we had our moments he and I You are forever in his
debt

ROWAN glances at Julien Lamplight dances on him Did his smile curl - the
black eyes
wink Her breath catches

CARLOTTA
What is it

ROWAN
(spooked edgy)
The lamplight Thats all

They reach a winding staircase at the halls end A gust of WIND blows the
lamp out DARKNESS

CARLOTTA
You can see well in the dark Rowan

ROWAN
(stiff simmering)
Better than most I suppose

CARLOTTA
Put your hatred for me aside so you can clearly see
what is ahead-
A match light - and it burns out the FRAME to a HOT WHITE
INT AN INN DAY
PETYR hellish and gaunt PETYR VAN ABELs VO

writes feverishly at a table I am lost to all
forever
How to tell what
Ive seen

on fresh parchment and not sound a madman
If
only I were
A sailor
PETYR glances out the window shall shepherd these
pages
at a ship in the harbor to you I dare not
board
the ship
fearing he will
suddenly he whirls round follow and send
innocents to
looking straight TO CAMERA their doom in my wake I
have cause for
my dread

THE IMAGE SHATTERS INTO

EXT A SEVENTEENTH CENTURY TOWN SQUARE MORNING

Encircled by shops A stake at the center sticks piled at its base A
torch burns ina

stanchion A church spire towers above it all PETYR is among the large
CROWD watching two

columns of PRIESTS near the stake Between them is SUZANNE - in a white robe
holding a large

candle The procession halts She scans the crowd and finds PETYR She
smiles at him Then

- her face turns fierce

SUZANNE
I never did any of you harm I am UNJUSTLY CONDEMNED
I have no love for Satan

The crowd jeers Burn her Witch Send her ashes to Hell She hurls
the candle down

SUZANNE
Witch is it (growls) Come now Lasher COME

A RUMBLING like thunder fills the air- A WIND begins to swirl The sky
darkens Curses
from the crowd as they raise arms and cloaks against the swirling dust

SUZANNE
My beautiful Lasher - strike down those who would come
to
see me die

The WIND howls Shutters break free windows shatter And from the
rooftops tiles - a storm

of them - shower down on the terror-stricken CROWD The town is being ripped
apart - and at the

eye of the storm SUZANNE watches eyes burning
PANIC people rush madly arms over heads trampling those whove fallen
Cries in the WIND

Blood puddles the ground Shops burn Bodies piled at every doorway
Armageddon

PETYR stands in the center of the chaos near a frantic PRIEST

PRIEST
Where is she FIND HER

SUZANNE (OC)
Petyr

SUZANNE IS HIGH UP ON THE CHURCH PARAPET
She leaps off - flying down robe rippling in the stort and crashes down atop
the Priest
PETYR - tears flowing - kneels at her broken body - and gently takes her hand
in his
A MANS VOICE (UNSEEN)
(powerfull booming)

Petyr Van Abel
PETYR looks up - and races away - just as the looming church tower sways -
and comes crashing
down
INT DIEDRES ROOM LATE NIGHT
CARLOTTA and ROWAN appear in the doorway

CARLOTTA
This was her room

ROWAN cocks her head and sniffs She gags

ROWAN
My god

She approaches the brass bed - its leather restraints hanging loose its
grimy stained
mattress is bare

ROWAN
You kept her in this filth in restraints

CARLOTTA
She didnt feel them

ROWAN
(through gritted teeth)
Youre a monster

CARLOTTA is at a window pointing to the patio below

CARLOTTA
Anthayour grandmotherher life ended there on the
stones Head split open like a melon

ROWAN
Why are you doing this Handing out these horrors
Why
CARLOTTA
(turns and looks ROWAN over)
You have the Mayfair eyes (pause) Tell me Rowan ---
what have those eyes seen that the mind cant
fathom

Their eyes lock The lamps flame dances in the BREEZE

CARLOTTA
(knowing chilling)
Hes shown himself to you on the deck In the
storm
ROWAN
(really spooked now a beat)
He
CALOTTA
(reading her mind)
And on the plane - he touched you
ROWAN
(stunned off-balance)
Shut up
CARLOTTA
Lasher touched you and you loved it
ROWAN
It wes a dream
CARLOTTA
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt
him -

and used his power - and went to hell with a smile

ROWAN
Stop it

CARLOTTA
Witches Rowan that is what we are

ROWAN
ENOUGH

ROWAN slams the wall Her fury rises Trembling CARLOTTA suddenly
flinches A hand to her
forehead A deep breath

CARLOTTA
Ahhh You are strong
ROWAN starts for the door CARLOTTA shuffles after her

CARLOTTA
Save your anger for him Let it keep you strong -
as I have Ive fought his all my life used my
power and anger to turn him away (pause) Diedre

was not so strong That is why I kept your mother a
morphined mindless shadow

ROWAN freezes at the door - and turns back to CARLOTTA

CARLOTTA
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the
stones -
even as she had him inside her

ROWAN
Youre mad Your mind is sick

CARLOTTA
and why I put thirty years between you and the
beautiful monster

To kill the legacy (pause) you are the sum of his
desires -
ROWAN
(a hateful hiss)
You - are - a - murderer
CARLOTTA

(a beat a chilling grin)
But I had to use my hands None before you could kill
with their mind
(ROWAN stands frozen)
Graham my dear Your uncle

BULLSEYE ROWAN steps back in horror The curtains flutter ROWAN backing
up unsteady down
the hall Furious Haunted CARLOTTA advancing something falls OC CRASH

ROWAN
No Youre wrong youre wrong

She has backed up to the staircase She trips aver the cat YOWL - and grabs
the bannister
CARLOTTA comes face to face

CARLOTTA
Did you like it Looking down at Graham and knowing

what you
could do

ROWAN
(erupting out of control
Im NOT like you Im NOT Youre cruel -
CARLOTTA suddenly winces- Eyes squeezing shut in pain

ROWAN
- twisted -
(a jagged moan from CARLOTTA)
- vicious You vile old -

CARLOTTAS hands fly to her head Her cane topples and RAT-TA-TATS down the
staircase She

wobbles - equilibrium going ROWAN comes out of her blind fury and grabs
her
ROWAN
Oh my god I - I --- (pause) Are you alright

(shakes CARLOTTA)
Carlotta Carlotta

And CARLOTTA - wounded stunned - slowly opens her eyes

CARLOTTA
Youre more dangerous than I knew Youre strength
will make
him more than he has ever been
(cold piercing)
I should have killed you

ROWAN releases her - pierced rocked by the words And she races down the
stairs into darkness

CARLOTTA
I SHOULD HAVE KILLED YOU WHEN YOU WHERE BORN

WHACK The door to Diedres room SLAMS shut CARLOTTA whirls round toward
it The WIND
MOANS

ON THE FIRST FLOOR LANDING - AT TNE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS
ROWAN freezes in her tracks at the sounds

BACK ON THE SECOND FLOOR

A gust of WIND whips at CARLOTTAS dress She grabs the bannister for
support A piercing

WHISTLE in the WIND CARLOTTA winces Grabs her head The cat MEOWS

CARLOTTA
So its now- when Im weakened (pause) you wretched
obscenity

Blood trickles from her nose and mouth An inner cataclysm jolts her - her
grip slips - she
topples down the stairs

ON THE FIRST FLOOR LANDING - THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS

ROWAN is frozen KATUNK-KATUNK-KATUNK - out of the DARK CARLOTTA
tumbles down the stairs

to ROWANS feet
ROWAN stares wide-eyed - then quickly kneels beside CARLOTTA grabbing her
limp wrist

checking for a pulse She puts her ear to CARLOTTAs chest shes dead
ROWAN stares in
horror --- then something shifts in her face Something unknowable suddenly
known Suddenly
believed

ROWAN

Youre here

SILENCE She walks slowly down the hall past the portraits Stopping with
her back to a huge
mirror in an ornate frame

ROWAN
I know youre here (pause) You killed her didnt
you (pause)
Come out you bastard

Behind her in the mirror - a foggy phantasm drifts across the glass - and is
gone ROWAN

looks down At her feet is the emerald pendant She picks it up OC down
the hall - the

TINKLE-TINKLE-TINKLE of glass ROWAN walks into

THE LIVING ROOM

Dust and decay Cracked leather chairs A chadelier of a hundred cut-glass
pieces Does it

sway slightly

ROWAN
What did she call you --- Lasher

She whirls round There in the corner -

the shimering transparent specter - handsom angular Rowan is stunned -
but still They eye

each other

ROWAN
What are you

The specter flickers - and disappears Sfle dashes to where it was And
then --- hands are
clutching her from behind She SHRIEKS --- she is twisted round --- and she

looks into
MICHAELS face - and violently clings to him

MICHAEL
What is it Tell me

She tries to find words suddenly - her head swivels from here to there -
looking round the
room

ROWAN
Theres something - someone --- here
He stiffens - and glances round the room

MICHAEL
Wheres Carlotta

ROWAN shivers - and slowly she points to the hall He takes her hand shes
like a mule
holding her ground He has to pull her with him out into

THE DARK HALL
and down to the foot of the stairs There lies CARLOTTA MICHAEL stares
drop-jawed

MICHAEL
Jesus christ
(a beat)
was it --- a man
ROWAN
(stunned)

But how did - how could you ---

From the DARK at the top of the stairs - FFFTT-FFFTT-FFFTT They freeze and
peer into the

BLACKNESS FFFTT-FFFTT MICHAEL picks up CARLOTTAs cane names it high
Its coming down
the steps closer And - something LEAPS out at that trot the DARK
ROWAN
Michael
MICHAEL swings lethally - and the cat soars past him - YEEOWWLLL - and

scampers away They
both exhale with spent fear - and look at each other

ROWAN
(a long beat)
You know
MICHAEL
(a slow nod)

I know Its not possible --- but I know

A long beat ROWAN is starting to tremble She looks down at CARLOTTAS
crumpled body

ROWAN
She - she said I - I was a ---

MICHAEL
- a witch

ROWAN looks back up at hit --- and nods

INT THE MAYFAIR MANSION PORCH AN HOUR LATER
ROWAN sits hollow-eyed in the rocking chair MICHAEL stands behind her his

gloved hands on
her shoulders

A whole town

Me nods gravely He starts to pace desperate for legic

anger

someone with

life with

A CORONER comes out

It couldve been a tornado - or a - a hurricane Maybe

ROWAN

(a long beat very softly)
Carlotta said I --- killed Graham - with - with my

MICHAEL
Ro - you cant really believe that Nobody can murder

their feelings I mean --- thats CRAZY

ROWAN
(an eyebrow arches)
Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to

hands that can see
(that silences him a beat)
God Michael --- what am I

ambulance GIFFORD walks to ROWAN and MICHAEL They watch the ambulance

pull away

GIFFORD

Likely a stroke (pause) we all got used to
thinking shed live forever (pause) Well -
she made it clear No ceremony just cremation
pause) Diedre now Carl (pause) You get some

sleep now Both of you

He kisses ROWAN - and he walks off toward a Cadillac at the curb A long

beat MICHAEL takes

ROWAN by the hand

MICHAEL
Cmon Lets go to the ho---

ROWAN
(jabs a finger at the house)
Hes in there
(whirls to the garden)
Or are you out for a stroll in the garden where

MICHAEL grabs her firmly - and shakes her

MICHAEL
Even if its all true - that doesnt make you a witch
Its 1992 Rowan

ROWAN
(her shoulders sag)
But it scares the hell out of you doesnt it
Michael

He hesitates - and takes her by the hand TRACK with them as they go down the
walk and - HOLD

on the swinging gate as they walk OUT OF FRAME TRACK back along the walk
up the steps to

the motionless rocking chair where the cat has curled up The chair starts
to rock

RRMMFF-SQUEAK-RRMMMFF

INT THE OPERATING ROOM IN ROWANS DREAM

ROWAN works feverishly on an OUT OF FRAME patient The MASKED FIGURES watch
silently ROWAN
throws her hands up in despair her confidence failing

ROWAN
I - I cant do it

The FIGURES urge her on - imploring encouraging her

ROWAN
(pointing OUT OF FRAME frantic)
But look LOOK How can I do it

oc - a muffled CRY TILT DOWN SLOWLY - the edge of the operating table comes
INTO FRAME - and
on it a tiny hand

ROWAN IS A HOTEL ROOM
writhing in a bed It is MORNING She screams -

ROWAN
LOOK

MICHAEL lunges INTO FRAME grabbing her shaking her She shoots up wide-
eyed sweaty
haunted

ROWAN
I had it again I cant save it - I dont know what to
do

INT THE TALAMASCA GALLERY

staring at Juliens portrait ARRON refills ROWANS coffee cup - and nods

himself to

Both Men stare at her

He silences her with a

AARON
Many times over the past thirty years Why he shows

me I dont know but Lashers not some mindless wraith

ROWAN
Then what is he

AARON
A spacial entity An organized energy something that

our definition of existence

MICHAEL
A what

AARON
A spirit Perhaps evil (to ROWAN) and he has
with Diedre gone - youve inherited him

ROWAN

Stop looking at me like that Im not some siren
chanting to the moon And my life is not a cosmic
whim I am in charge of my life -

(a long heat resolved firm)
- and I want to stay

(MICHAEL does a double-take)
Everything that was taken from me is here Michael
All these years she was there without me Helpless
I should have been here

MICHAEL
(coming to her)
Rowan Think of whats in that book Think of last
night
ROWAN

ROWAN
Do you love me Michael

MICHAEL
Yes I love you Very much
ROWAN
Ive come home Michael for the first time I want to
stay here -

A long beat MICHAEL glances at AARON AARON shrugs

AARON
Going away doesnt mean you leave Lasher behind
He was on Rowans deck - and the plane geography

seems irrelevant now

ROWAN
Michael - you loved that house as a child You could
work again You could make it ours Well sweep out the
horror And Lasher with it

MICHAEL eyes her Thinking Intrigued in spite of his fear

MICHAEL
Itd take mounths and cost a fortune

MICHAEL frowns begrudgingly He rises walks to the window and lights a
cigarette staring at

the night she watches him He sends a stream of smoke out the window
Finally

MICHAEL
You really felt him - inside you

She comes up behind him Her hands slip round his waist

ROWAN
It was like a dream It wasnt real

MICHAErL
But it wasnt a dream And he is real

She takes his face in her hands - and shakes her head
ROWAN
This is real

And she kisses him deeply

She turns to an antique toy chest raises the cover CREAK

ROWAN
Oh Michael look

He reaches down and lifts out a marionette by the wooden slats It dangles
on its strings He

flicks his hand - the marionette does a jig ROWANS eyes have welled with
tears

ROWAN

MICHAEL
(watches her a beat)
Lets see

Her face creases in contusion - then widens in understanding-

ROWAN

his cheeks -

and blows The marionette does a jig DIEDRE giggles

He kisses her softly Then - LASHER looks up straight ro CAMERA (to
MICHAEL) - and smiles

They turn now into
JACKSON SQUARE

Artists doing portraits fortune tellers clowns jugglers Soft jazz comes

from behind
shadowed filigreed balconies

AARON
Its about fear Michael Fear is the loss of an
anchor You must find
your place amongst everything Then the fear will
leave - and then
you can decide what gets in - and what doesnt

MICHAEL
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca huh

There is a difference between sensing danger - and
being afraid

AARON
Then focus on how you feel about her Because your
feelings define

AARON stops at an old iron hitching post with a horses head at the top
embedded in the
sidewalk MICHAEL hesitates - and takes his gloves off

AARON
Now - do you want to let anything in

She pushes his gloved hana away - and rubs his cleft atfectionately with her
finger She
grins

ROWAN
Arent we supposed to love somebody for their moral
rectitude or
their courage or their beneficence -

MICHAEL
Their what

ROWAN
So how come I love you most when you stick your finger
in your chin

She gives hima kiss

MICHAEL
Wanna snack
ROWAN
A little wine

And he leaves ROWAN smiles to herself - and starts brushing her hair She
picks up a hand

mirror to see the results LASHERS face locks back at her just over her
sholder She jumps

a mile - whirls round There is no one there She slowly looks back to the
mirror - there is

his reflection again with his melancholy smile Her face hardens

LASHER
I am with you (pause) You yearn to know me - so I am
with you
you call me --- and I love you all the more for that
(gentle poignant)
I know how the desert flower feels when it drinks of
the rain

ROWAN is motionless entranced by his words by the music of his voice
Translucent hands seep
out of the mirror and frame her face caressing her

LASHER
You do not love Michael How can you love - if you
lie
ROWAN
Lie
LASHER

There are things you will not tell him

She raises an eyebrow He strokes her Her eyes close in sensual
contentment Spectral
fingers caress a breast

ROWAN
Michael is healing If I hide things from him - its
because love him

LASHER takes this in Does he smile

LASHER
Then you will lie to him about me - wont you

ROWANS eyes snap open - narrowed in anger Heating up from within Focused
on the mirror
Suddenly the glass SHATTERS - piece falling to the floor

LASHERS VOICE
You grow stronger

And a spectral image of MICHAEL rises in slivers from the scattered chards -
like a shredded
willowy phantom
LASHERS VOICE (IN MICHAELS FORM)
Can he make you feel as I do

MICHAEL COMES THROUGH THE DOORWAY
with a sandwich and a glass of wine And LASHER is gone

MICHAEL
(chewing bad French accent)
A chardonnay mademoiselle - pleasantly mild but
pretentious

ROWAN stares at him - between two worlds He sees the shattered glass - and
comes to her Her
hand is bleeding

MICHAEL
Hey - youre bleeding

ROWAN
(fuzzy hollow)
Dropped it
MICHAEL grabs a tissue - and starts to wrap her hand
INT THE MANSION A ROOM THE NEXT MORNING
MICHAEL - in wedding attire - tries to do his tie with gloved fingers STU

pushes MICHAELS
hands away and starts tying it

STU
You okay
MICHAEL
Just nervous Getting married you know (pause)
Got the rings
STU

what rings

MICHAEL shoots him a look - just to make sure hes kidding

MICHAEL
Get out of here Im gonna have my final cigarette I
promised
Ro Id quit
STU pats him affectionately on the cheek --- and leaves

MICHAEL lights up a smoke closes his eyes - takes a deep drag - and exhales
The thick smoke

floats in the air and it coats LASHERS translucent form - making him
visible standing

inches in front of MICHAEL LASHER blows gently at the smoke - and it floats
back toward

MICHAELS face
MICHAEL opens his eyes --- LASHER is gone MICHAEL puts on his coat - and

walks out

INT THE MANSION - ROWAN AND MICHAELS ROOM SAME TIME

ROWAN stands in her wedding gown BEATRICE - in a gold dress - adjusts

ROWANS cleavage to a
more daring angle

BEATRICE
Always give the crovd a taste darling
(reaches to the jewelry box)
Now - Ryan said Im supposed to make sure -

ROWAN
(suddenly cold)
I dont want it
BEATRICE opens the box and takes out the emerald pendant

BEATRICE
(mimicking RYANS somber tone)

The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant

an
her wedding day
(deadpan)
We should all have to suffer such burdens

ROWAN
Then you wear it

BEATRICE

Cmon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition

And she fastens it round ROWANS neck The jewel gleams ROWAN scowls at

herself in the
mirror KNOCK-KNOCK BAETRICE turns to the door with a frown

BEATRICE
Nobodys supposed to see the -

AARON (OC)
May I - come in

AARON opens the door and steps inside His smile blooms
AARON
The most beautiful Mayfair of all (pause
almost ready

BEATRICE turns to ROWAN - and her eyes well up

BEATRICE
God bless this day darling

She gives ROWAN a hug and leaves AARON takes ROWANS hands in his

Theyre
AARON

ROWAN
(a warm smile)
Youve been shadowing the family for thirty years

Her smile broadens - and her cheeks redden

AARON
Ah the perfect touch A blushing bride

And she kisses him on the cheek

far up into the

sky

EXT THE MAYFAIR GROUNDS - LATE MORNING

A gaggle of Mayfairs in their party best Kids dart between grownups legs
Backs are
slapped Glasses are drained

ANOThER CORNER OF THE PORCH

ARRON listens as GIFFORD - drunk - rmbles on between gulps of bourbon The
cat sits in his

lap MICHAEL and ROWAN stand off to the side listening

GIFFORD
Turn over a rich southern family and you find wackos -

Yup A witch

A hand smacks the back of GIFFORDS head Its BEATRICE

BEATRICE

Yknow - make us rich

some stuff about

bringing them all back through a door
BEATRICE

Gifford Mayfair - Ill cook your tongue on a spit
(pause) witches

GIFFORD
Hell - Julien believed it Carlotta too and god
knows more than a
few of us called her a witch

LAUGHTER from the CROWD ARRON glances at ROWAN and MICHAEL - who listen
silent and

expressionless

GIFFORD
Ever taken a good look at the portraits

GIFFORD rises with the cat - and they all follow him inside
INT THE MAYFAIR MANSION - THE MAIN HALL MOMENTS LATER
GIFFORD cat in his arms has led the group to the portraits

GIFFORD
See that

In each portrait a Mayfair stands an the foreground and in the background -
at each painting
- sometimes clear sometimes partially hidden - is a keyhole-shaped door

GIFFORD
Every one of ‘em - in front of one of those doors
See
They believed it

The cat suddenly HISSES and dives out of GIFFORDS arms

ROWAN
eyes the paintings - and takes MICHAELS hand in hers
GIFFORD
(raises his glass)
A toast to Rowan and Michael May they always drink of
love and always love to drink

And he drinks as LAUGHTER fills the hall
INT THE MANSION - THE SECOND FLOOR HALL LATER
GIFFORD walks drunkenly down the empty hall

FROM BEHIND HIM - A TRACKING SHOT
zooms up and past him - BZZZZZ-KPIT And he walks into

DIEDRES ROOM
New studs and sheetrock are up- The cat wanders in

GIFFORD
(strolls bourbon-mellowed)
Ahh Deedee Fewer and fewer of us left now hmm
(pause) what
happens to the stories when were all gone

Then - he grins - bends down - and rises with the gold saw

GIFFORD
Two hundred bucks for a saw

He angles the saw so he can see his reflection And in the gleaming gold
surface he sees A
HELLISH FACE OF SKULL AND BLOODIED FLESH His face

EXT THE MAYFAIR MANSION LATER THAT AFTERNOON

As the guests go home ROWAN and ARRON lean on the porch railing watching
MICHAEL on the

sidewalk putting STU in a cab A long beat Then ROWAN grins faintly to
herself

ROWAN
Yes - I do trust you

ARRON
Your powers are growing Rowan I wasnt even that
focused

She looks at him Their eyes lock Her face sobers at what she senses

ROWAN
I have seen him again Last night

AARON
But youve not told Michael

She shakes her head NO MICHAEL comes out the door-
BEATRICE

Gifford (pause) You seen my big-mouthed drunk
of a brother

(shrugs) Probably stumbling home propositioning the
fire hydrants

(hugs ROWAN tightly)

Safe trip darling And dont forget to put on the Do

Not Disturb sign

She grins at AARON - and heads down the walk

AARON
Lasher will act Rowan Whatever it is he wants - hes
waited three
hundred years to have it (pause) facing him alone
I dont like -

ROWAN
(adamant)
Lasher is my legacy - not Michaels (pause) Aaron
Ive seen the
pain in Michael I cant bear to see anymore (Pause)
Hes not to
know Swear to me

AARON stares back - and finally nods they watch MICHAEL walk along the
outside of the
wrought-iron fence to the gate RAT-TA-TAT-TATING with a stick

ROWAN
Aaron - I really could protect him - ifit I had to

Watching MICHAEL AARON reaches out and takes her hand
EXT BAYOU COUNTRY LATER THAT AFTERNOON

A small highway- The late sun filters through the thick mossy trees on
either side Water
shimers in the BG A Mercedes coupe zooms INTO FAME and speeds away

INSIDE THE CAR
ROWAN is at the wheel with MICHAEL beside her

MICHAEL
(starts singing softly)
Im going back someday come what may - to Blue Bayou
where the -

ROWAN
(growls out Creedence Clearwater)
My pappy said Girl dont let the man git ya - and do

MICHAEL leans back and appraises her Gives her an Irn impressed nod And
she turns - and
gives him a wink

INT THE NEWLYWEDS HOTEL ROOM THAT NIGHT

MICHAEL in silk pajama slacks and his gloves sits on the edge ot the bed-
ROWAN stands

before him in a sheer robe Cool seductive She unties the robes sash
and it slips to the

floor The moonlight washes over her body

ROWAN
(soft but alosta command)
Im yours now - completely I want your touch

(pause) Try
Michael Dont let anything else in

Her face shines with passion and power She peels his gloves off - places
his hands on her -

and buries his face against her He hesitates then starts exploring her
with his hands

She pushes him back onto the bed A slow sexual ballet begins - and
escalates she straddles

him - and mounts him Gazing down at him she slides into a slow thick
rhthym Her eyes

close A MOAN slips from her

ROWAN
Yes Michael Harder--
(MICHAEL shifts into a faster gear)
More

LASHER (UNSEEN)
Like this

She stiffens - her eyes pop open

LASHER - spectral his nakedness flickering - appears wrapped round her
trorn behind His face

against her flushed cheek - his body moving getting her back into her myths

LASHER
I am with you my love Like no other can ever be

ROWAN
(between passion and fear)
Nooo NO Stop

MICHAEL pounds at her harder hearing only passion in her voice No for YES
STOP for DONT
STOP He cant see LASHER

ROWAN
(going through the roof
God no Oh god

LASHER strokes her roughly - perfectly
LASHER
Like no other

MICHAEL
Jesus

ROWAN
STOP

LASHER

Always loved you

The bodies move like a fierce machine ROWANS climax takes her to
speechlessness She
collapses onto MICHAEL The lovers lie still and silent LASHER is gone

INT THE HOTEL ROOM THE NEXT MORNING

MICHAEL and ROWAN in bed asleep He wakes with a sleepy smile and reaches
out to her she
wakes with a jolt -

MICHAEL
Hi Im Michael curry your husband

ROWAN focuses on him - getting her bearings His hand slides under the
covers to her body
She stops him

ROWAN
(almost hard)
No (softens) Not - not now

She pulls the covers up over her His grin shows

MICHAEL
When you get married I thought the sex stopped after
the
honeymoon

She rolls away from him He shrugs - and gets out of bed

ROWAN
opens an eye listening to him leave she closes her eyes

EXT THE NEWLYWEDS BAYOU COTTAGE PATIO DAY

ROWAN lies in a lounge chaise eyes closed She looks under the weather
MICHAEL sits next to

her sketching - his eyes dart from his pad to ROWAN Deft quick strokes-

MICHAEL
You look a little green

ROWAN
(eyes closed flat)
Mm-hmmm

MICHAEL
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night

ROWAN
Mm-hmm

He grins Sketching quickly now finishing He holds up it is a goofy
caricature of ROWAN
gap-toothed freckled cross-eyed with pigtails going out at angles

MICHAEL
So - you like your portrait

ROWAN - eyes closed - gives the slightest of nods MICHAEL smiles
mischievously

MICHAEL
Gee - look at that I didnt know alligators came this
far up on shore

ROWAN
Mm-hmm

Suddenly - her eyes pop open She shoots up -

ROWAN
Alligator

MICHAEL grins - lies back down - and closes his eyes
EXT A BAYOU GAS STATION IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE NIGHT

The pumps - old with faded paint The office - a weathered shack on the
porch an OLD MAN

sits in the shadows with an accordion playing an eerie tune A funky pick-
up truck is parked

off to the side The Mercedes pulls in at the pumps

INSIDE THE CAR
MICHAEL and ROWAN wait for service He honks the horn

MICHAEL
Everybody must be out back sacrificing a virgin to the
crocodile
god

He gets out and walks toward the OLD MAN with the accordion who sits with
his back to the car

MICHAEL
Excuse me
(taps the OLD MAN on the shoulder)
Im trying to find -
The OLD MAN turns round - half his face is a mass of ancient scars - thick
and deep - winding

all the way down his neck MICHAEL reflexively rears back stunned the OLD
MAN smiles

OLD MAN
Jesus stopped here once - for directions

And out of the office comes an ATTENDANT - 50 greasy overalls a friendly
grin

ATTENDANT
Gator got him nice huh mister

MICHAEL stares at the OLD MAN And then - the ATTENANT sees the Mercedes
His eyes widen

ATTENDANT
Jesus St Cracker Look at that beauty

He walks to the car circling it admiring it He smiles in at ROWAN Two
MEN - 30s jeans

and t-shirts - come out of the office and stand arms folded staring at the
car The

ATTENDANT leans in a window eyeing the cars interior

MICHAEL
We on the right road to the Cajun Kitchen

The two MEN get into the pick-up truck and drive off

ATTENDANT
See ya later boys (to MICHAEL) Yknow I buy
American - every
time Hell its the right thing to do but nobody ever

MICHAEL gets in the car Turns the ignition - and stares over at the OLD
MAN sitting

motionless The ATTENDANT pats the car - and the Mercedes pulls away The OLD
MAN starts

playtng the slow soft tune again

EXT A SMALL DARK ROAD MINUTES LATER
The Mercedes cruises Mossy trees shimmer in the headlights
INSIDE THE CAR
ROWAN
(grins a southern twang)

Nobody makes a car like them Nasis

MICHAEL
(grins turns to her)
Did you see the old man on the ---

ROWAN
(straightening up eye widening)
Michael

MICHAEL locks back to the road The pick-up truck is stopptd in the middle
of the road

MICHAEL jams on the brakes and skids to a stop Then - from outside the
window - CLICK

MICHAEL turns - and stares down the barrel of a shotgun held in the hands of
grinning MAN 1

MAN 1
You two lovebirds wanna step outside

MAN 2 appears at ROWANS door - and opens it for her ROWAN and MICHAEL
exchange looks -
and step out onto the road on opposite sides of the car

MAN 2
Ill bet somebody owns a car like that carries a let o
cash
MAN 1
Yup Lots
MICHAEL

(simmering deadpan)
Thats smart thinking Tell me - which one of you got
to use the brain

MAN 1s grin evaporates He shoves MICHAEL with the gun

MAN 1
Give me your wallet asshole

MICHAEL glares at him

ROWAN
Michael - give him the money

MICHAEL digs out his wallet and hands it to MAN 1

MAN 1
Now wasnt that easy You should try harder at
being a help
Michael
MAN 2
Thats probably what she says - Try harder Michael
Right
Sammy
MAN 1

(a lewd chuckle)
Yeah Harder Michael Harder

His words make ROWANS eyes widen MAN 2 runs his hand across ROWANS
cheek She stiffens
He hooks his arm round her neck drawing her face to him roughly

MAN 2
That what you tell him hon

MICHAEL
Get your goddamn hands -

MAN 1 slams MICHAEL against the car MAN 2 locks ROWAN in a grubby kiss
She is solid

stone Her eyes focused on MAN 2 like a gunsight Suddenly - he breaks
off the kiss - and

releases her Staring at her weirdly

MAN 1
(laughs)
Shit Rollie - she give you a shock

MAN 2 steps back from ROWAN his face twisting up wincing Something is
happening
ROWAN glares at him like a beacon

MAN 1
(his smile fades)
Rollie Hey man

MAN 2 goes down on one knee hands going to his head MAN 1 comes over to
him - his alarm
growing-

MAN 1
Hey - whats witb you man

MAN 2 groans and falls to the ground writhing in the glare of the cars
headlights a
trickle of blood at his nose MAN 1 whirls on ROWAN with the shotgun

MAN 1
What the fucks going on whatd you do to him

MICHAEL leaps to the hood - takes MAN 1 down with a flying tackle - grabs
the shotgun and
knocks him cold with the butt He whirls to ROWAN -

MICHAEL
Get in the car
(ROWAN is entranced)
Rowan

Shes in another world He shoves her inside - dives in his side - screeches
into reverse
does a 180 and speeds away
INSIDE THE CAR
MICHAEL - freaked - driving like a bat out of hell ROWAN slumps in her seat
slowly coming

back
MICHAEL
(revving blown away)
Jesus fucking Christ That was you wasnt it
ROWAN

(she is silent hazy)
But it wasnt like Graham - or Carlotta not blind fury
This time
you controlled it didnt You Didnt you

Goddamnit ANSWER ME

She slowly turns to him - her face white and haggard
ROWAN
(flat faraway)

Yes
He stares at her - silent in the face of her power
EXT THE MAYFAIR MANSION LATE NIGHT
The Mercedes pulls up and parks MICHAEL gets out dishevelled scraped up
ROWN gets out her

side They stand there Staring at the house A long beat Shes reading
his mind

ROWAN
No - I didnt kill him (pause) Would you rather Id
let
them kill us - after theyd raped me
MICHAEL
(softly)
No (pause) This is unreal
ROWAN
Its not some fairytale in an old book (pause)
Michael -

(he looks at her mutely)

I didnt choose this Michael This is who I am
(deeply poignantly)

I love you

MICHAEL
I love you too

A long beat They walk to the dark house and enter A light comes on STU
comes sleepily
down the stairs
STU
What are you doing here

They walk past him - silent exhausted - and step into their room and close
the door

INT THE OPERATING ROOM IN ROWANS DREAM

ROWAN works feverishly on an OUT or FRAME patient The rnasked FIGURES
watching silently
ROWAN throws her hands up in despair her confidence failing

ROWAN
I - I cant do it

The others urge her on - imploring encouraging her

ROWAN
(pointing OUT OF FRAME frantic)
But look LOOK How can I do it

oc - a muffled CRY TILT DOWN slowly - the operating table comes INTO FRAME
- and lying on it

A TINY HAND PULL OUT slowly to REVEAL more of the body on the table the
tiny hand and an

arm joined to a ---

ROWAN SUDENLY WAKES IN BED BESIDE MICHAEL

she tosses the sheets back - and stumbles into the BATHROOM She closes the
door kneels at

the toilet --- and vomits

FADE TO BLACK
FADE UP TO
EXT THE MAYFAIR GROUNDS A WEEK LATER - DUSK

Autumn is browning the foliage The mansion renovation shows great progress
The rain pours
down

INT THE MAYFAIR MANSION - THE LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

Rain streams down the windows ROWAN sits reading as MICHAEL kneels at the
fireplace ina
sweater muttering striking matches trying in vain to start a fire

MICHAEL
Fall in New Orleans This whole town is waterlogged
The matches
the wood my clothes my skin

ROWAN
Thats cause were below sea level

MICHAEL
(crabby)
ROWAN were below sea level Ive spent time there
myself

ROWAN
Thats not funny

He sighs - walks to the window and stares out at the rain his back to the
room

MICHAEL
(sings - half to himself)
I left my heart in Ran Sanfisco

ROWAN glances at the fireplace - with an almost mischievous look She
focuses on the logs -
her gaze narrows - as if she is trying to see something that isnt there
Shes going inside
herseif summoning up something And -

A FLAME
suddenly flicks out from the logs

ROWAN

intensitiet her stare and --- the logs bursts into flame She grins to
herself - and buries

her nose in her book

MICHAEL
Ro what do you think about - about spending
Thanksgiving back
in -

Turning now he stops - seeing the blaze Huh He does a slow turn to
ROWAN - eyeing her
suspiciously

MICHAEL
You did that didnt you

ROWAN
(looks up innocently)
Talking to me dear

He shrugs - and walks before the fire staring into it ROWAN watches him

MICHAEL
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---

ROWAN
(smiles)
- we made a fire

A beat Suddenly her smile drops Shes read his thoughts

ROWAN
(firm almost defensive)
Thats not true
MICHAEL whirls round to her his back to the fire

MICHAEL
Stop doing that If Ive something to say let me say
it - out
loud

ROWAN gives hi a chastened nod A beat

MICHAEL
How can you say it isnt true Were not the same
Not like we
used to be (sighs) Youre changing - all the time

She rises - walks to him - and takes his face in her hands

ROWAN
Michael - what made you fall in love with me

MICHAEL
(a beat straightfaced)
Your beneficence

ROWAN
(grins)
Im serious (in earnest) Whatever it was - its
still there
inside me isnt it - change and all

MICHAEL hesitates - and nods He slowly grins

MICHAEL
Just do me a favor Dont start anymore fires - or
turn on the
lights by blinking - or cook with your hands behind
your -

And suddenly -

the blaze silently erupts from the fireplace - becoming a demonic fiery
virsion of LASHER - a

mass of jagged leaping flames - and hovers over them unseen by MICHAEL
ROWANS eyes bulge

- and she wraps her arm tightly - glaring furiously at the flaming specter
LASHER dissolves

into a thousand flames - and disappears MICHAEL separates himself fram her -
startled

MICHAEL
What the hall are you -

And she pulls him back to her - and holds him tight

ROWAN
(shaking with emotion)
I love you more than anything in the world Michael
(glances at the room)
More than anything

EXT THE MAYFAIR MANSION DAY - A WEEK LATER

MICHAEL AND STU are high up on ladders fitting and hammering copper flashing
along the eaves

They dont see ROWAN come through the gate and up the walk

MICHAEL
(singing)
There is a house in xew Orleans

BZZZ2Z

MICHAEL and STU
they call the Rising Sun

ROWAN
I thought it was whistle while you work

STU
(looks down)
Is that a crack about our singing

ROWAN
Is that what you were doing
MICHAEL grins - and goes back to hammering WHACK WHACK
ROWAN

(brimming with excitment)
Michael I spoke to the geneticist from Stanford and

she -

And - a rung of MICHAELS ladder cracks He falls grabbing at air --- and
finally grabs on to

a rung hanging suspended --- twisting Nobody breathes and he finally gets

his footing

MICHAEL
Goddamn sonuvabitch

Sighs of relief all around He climbs down BZZ2Z2ZZ

ROWAN
You alright

MICHAEL
A little sore Darm (to STU) Finish up my section
will ya

STU nods - and leans to the spot where Michael was working

MICHAEL
(to ROWAN)
You were saying

ABOVE THEM - STU POUNDS THE FLASHING

WHACK something drops free from beneath the eaves - grey round - like a
huge melon with

ridges - landing in front of him on the gutter BZZZZZZZ Two black
antennae wiggle out of

a crack in the sphere

STU
(softly - with realization)
Oh shit

The sphere splits open - and dozens and dozens of WASPS swarm out - a black
cloud enveloping

him He screams - topples tram the ladder - and lands with THUD ROWAN and
MICHAEL rush to

him STU lies motionless

INT A HOSPITAL ROOM EVENING - TWO HOURS LATER

ROWAN and MICHAEL sit at STUS bedside STU sleeps - his arm in a cast - his
face and hands
swollen beyond recognition MICHAEL shakes his head sadly steeped in grief

MICHAEL
Is he - is he gonna die

ROWAN
(her eyes locked on STU)
Lock the door
(MICHAEL looks at her - confused)
Lock it

He rises and locks the door Then turns and watches silent

ROWAN is still Her eyes narrow into slits of concentration The air seems
to shimmer around

her She leans to STU - to his grotesque swollen lips She closes her eyes
- and kisses

him STUS deformed face shimmers - the angry flesh lightens and slowly
it shrinks back

to his normal visage

ROWAN opens her eyes - and slowly turns to MICHAEL who stands flattened
against the wall

speechless amazed She turns back to STU grasps his disfigured hand
brings his fingers to

her lips - and kisses them one by one

INT THE MANSION - A FIRST FLOOR ROOM LATER THAT NIGHT
The room is unfinished There is a bed and a dresser MICHAEL sits on the
bed staring at the

floor ROWAN - in a robe - sits beside him

ROWAN
It was an accident
(MICHAEL raises a skeptical eyebrow)
Michael - there isnt a house in New Orleans this old
that doesnt
have a wasps nest somewhere

He stares at her - unconvinced She tries for logical -

ROWAN
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu

MICHAEL
I dont know

He lies back and turns off the light DARKNESS She lies beside him reaches
out and finds his
hand A long beat

MICHAEL
You changed him Rowan You went right down to each
cell - and
changed him

They lie there silently

INT THE BEDROOM LATER THAT NIGHT

MICHAEL sleeps ROWAN lies beside him staring out the window A BREEZE
whistles she rises

and walks out of the room - down the hallway - out the front door and down
i

nto

THE GARDEN
She stares at the sky There is a bright moon but no stars

ROWAN
A moon but no stars

The trees and bushes sway in the BREEZE

ROWAN

The wasps were meant for Michael - but theres only so
much you

can control isnt there The great and powerful
lasher - undone by

a faulty ladder-

(SILENCE)
Why would you hurt him Answer me

LASHER (UNSEEN)
I love you Rowan Ive always loved you
(ROWAN whirls around)
I only wanted to be in your thoughts To bring myself
into your
thoughts - so I could be as we are now

ROWAN
YOU VIOLATED ME ON MY WEDDING NIGHT

LASHER (UNSEEN)
(curious sincere)
Explain this to me --- violated

ROWAN
You bastard

The BREEZE blows stronger A huge flower drops at her feet

LASHER (UNSEEN)
I made it for you

ROWAN bends and picks up the bizarre flower- Intrigued

ROWAN
Made it

LASHER (UNSEEN)
It is from love

ROWAN
To love you must be able to feel

LASHER (UNSEEN)
If you knew how I yearn for that

And --- there in the moonlight LASHER materializes Shimmering
Transparent Spectral
Beautiful Melancholy

LASHER
If I could feel like you feelbut I have only others
feelings - like
breeres that blow through me Things to be felt yes -
-- but not nine
to feel

ROWAN
(to be reckoned with)
It you harm Michael I will let my anger loose And
you will feel that
Do you understand

LASHER
(chastened softly)

Yes
(a long beat)
My love is as strong as Michaels How is it there is
love in you for
one - and not for another

She is stunned by the depth of his question He smiles

ROWAN
Youre very clever arent you

LASHER
I am only what you are --- what all of you have been
(pause) what
do you think of yourself now my love

She stares at the flower Feeling its texture Smelling it

ROWAN
How much of it is me - alone and how much is you
(LASHER flickers)
Lasher --- what do you want

And he DISSOLVES nothing She looks at the flower It starts to shrivel -
and disintegrates
in her fingers

DISSOLVE TO

EXT THE MAYFAIR MANSION WEEKS LATER - DAY

The house is closer to renovations end than the beginning
INT THE MAYFAIR MANSION - DIEDRES ROOM SAME TIME

The room is almost done MICHAEL stands at the empty window frames
gloveless with a sketch

pad BZZZ-KPIT he cocks his head - and looks over at the toy chest He
walks to the chest

opens it and takes out the marionette It dangles from his hand twirling
slowly

MICHAEL eyes it closely - his face suddenly creasing --- The marionette looks
like MICHAEL -
its dressed like him and it is wearing gloves

LASHERS VOICE
I love the room Michael

And - the marionette starts to grow MICHAEL drops it in terror - it keeps
growing - till it

is life-size its body clattering as it jerks about like a huge wooden
puppet-version of

MICHAEL

THE MARIONETTE
Michael - youve forgotten your gloves Better off with
them on
dont you think (pause) Here

And with a monstrous LAUGH the MARIONETTE pulls off a glove - and his hand
comes with it

Blood spurts from the wrist The other glove flies off with the same
result
MICHAEL stumbles back flailing at the muck The MARIONETTE clatters to the
floor in a zillion
sparks of dust The disembodied gloved hands lie twitching And -

they mutate Bubbling turning scabrous Claws sprout from the fingers They
become monstrous

crabs with human eyes scuttling along the floor toward MICHAEL At his feet
now - climbing up

his legs - up his chest MICHAEL swats them to the floor - and stomps on them
again and again

and again turning them to pulp

ROWAN (CC)
Whatre you drawing

MICHAEL IS STANDING FROZEN AT THE WINDOW

pad and pencil still in his hand ROWAN comes INTO FRAME He turns - in the
ozone She looks

at the pad He has sketched the marionette dangling from a disembodied
hand

ROWAN

Thats really good

(a beat she sighs)
I have to go mleet Bea for lunch now

(MICAEL is frozen)
I feel so had for her- Theres still no word on

Gifford-

shes a wreck

MICHAEL
(soft fuzzy)
Give her my best

Rowan cocks her head at him - leans and gives a quick kiss and leaves He
looks down at the
sketch and stares silently

EXT THE FRENCH MARKET AFTERNOON

An outdoor bazaar An old BLACK MAN cataracts fogging his eyes plays
guitar while a BLACK
BOY tap-dances beside him

ROWAN AND BEATRICE SIT IN AN OPEN PATIO CAFE

BEATRICE has a beer and a huge plate of oysterts Chewing she points at the
plate ROWAN

shakes her head NO

ROWAN
That food poisoning did a job on me

BEATRICE
I told you not to honeymoon in the Bayou (pause) I
remember when
Giff ate a bad batch of ---
Her eyes fill with tears ROWAN reaches for her hand

ROWAN
Im sure hes alright Bea Theyll find him somewhere

BEATRICE
Its over a month (sighs) The police say it happens
all the time

She musters a weak smile Her eyes shift to the crowd

BEATRICE
Isnt that your friend

ROWAN turns to see AARON - watching the guitarist and dancer

ROWAN
Aaron

He turns - blooms in a smile - strolls over - and bows

ARRON
The Ladies Mayfair Good afternoon

He leans to ROWAN - and they kiss Me turns to BEATRICS and kisses her hand
He sits down -
and looks ROWAN over

AARON
Are you alright You look pale

ROWAN
(good-naturedly)
I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health
Im the
doctor

But AARON is suddenly very focused concentrated Staring at her And
finally - he smiles

AARON
There are two

ROWAN
Two what

AARON
Two heartbeats

BEATRICE
Excuse me

ARRON

(points at ROWANS stomach)
There

ROWAN looks down at herself Her eyes widen in realization
AARON nods calmly

ROWAN
Are you sure

BEATRICE looks from one to the other

BEATRICE
What are you two talking about

AARON
(his smile widens)
Rowan - is pregnant

ROWAN looks up at him and beams BEATRICE is stunned

BEATRICE
But how could - how can you possibly ---

And she sits back - and stares at them

INT THE MAYFAIR GARDEN LATER THAT DAY - DUSK

CLOSE-UP - A BUSH WITH LARGE EMERALD-GREEN FLOWERS
has bloomed Extraordinary exotic bizarre OC - joyful LAUGHTER

MICHAEL

whirling ROWAN round in his arms

he smothers her
with a deep kiss

INT THE MANSION PORCH NIGHT

PAN TO

Both of them grinning and laughing And

MICHAEL and ROWAN sit side by side rocking in their chairs holding hands

staring at the
garden

Grayson

He grins - and nods

MICHAEL

If its a boy --- Taylor
ROWAN

A bit much (Pause) Lucas
MICHAEL

Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas

ROWAN
(makes a tace)
Where are you gitting these
(thinking her face lights)
Aaron --- if its a boy

They lean to each other and kiss

MICHAEL
And if its a girl --- Diedre

(thinks)
She blooms in a painful smile A tear runs down her cheek
EXT THE CEMETERY THE NEXT DAY - DUSK

Deserted ROWAN with a bouquet of tulips walks past shadowed crypts and
stops before the

huge Mayfair crypts the vault marked DIEDRE MAYFAIR - 1943- 1992 The vaults
ledge is

festooned with flowers A long beat

ROWAN
(a sad smile softly)
Im going to have a baby (pause) Michael wants to

name it

after you - if its a girl Diedre Mayfair Curry
Pretty huh

(pause) Funny --- I never really thought Id ever ---

LASHER (OC)
I bring her flowers too

ROWAN whirls round LASHER sits crosslegged on a crypt She glances from
side to side

LASHER
There is no one here but the dead

ROWAN
Go away I dont want you here

LASHER
If that were true I would not be here

ROWAN
Its very dangerous to assume you know what a woman
wants

LASHER

From the night on the moor when I was swept into the
world and first

knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has
wanted me suzann

and Deborah Stella - Marguerite - Antha - Diedre -
All of them

(a beat his melancholy smile)
And you will have a child

She glares at him --- and slowly nods

LASHER
A girl

ROWAN
(eyes him a beatvery cod)
Its too soon to know
She turns her back on him and puts her bouquet on the vaults ledge She
doesnt move LASHER
suddenly locks confused

LASHER
You fear me Why when you yearn so to know me
(pause) You
want more from me than the pleasure Much more

He glides to her His spectral face right before hers

LASHER
you crave what I might show you What you can learn
What
I can give you
(a beat)
So much more than Michael can

ROWAN
(a powerful smile of strength)
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you
could ever
inderstand

LASHER
(pained touching)
But I could understand I want to understand

ROWAN
I LOVE him

LASHER
(shimmering angered)
Do not tell me that

ROWAN
I LOVE MICHAEL MICHAEL

LASHER flickers furiously --- and disappears ROWAN scans the cemetery

ROWAN
Lasher Lasher

SCRRUNNCH She turns The marble lid or a crypt is slowly sliding off
and clatters to

the ground Then the lid of a coffin comes INTO VIEW as it opens And - a
discolored skeleton

rises up and climbs out - and walks toward ROWAN She watches wide-eyed
holding her fear in

check The skeleton stops before her - raises its arm and bony fingers gently
caress ROWAN

whitened cheek

LASHERS VOICE (WITHIN THS SKELESTON)
(tender - but menacing)
Michael will look like this one day (pause) but
not I
ROWANS face suddenly twists in anger She grabs the skeleton by the ribcage
- and slams it
against the MAYFAIR crypt It breaks into pieces and crumples to the ground

INT THE MAYFAIR MANSION LIVING SLOOM

Almost finished A magnificent design MICHAEL AARON and STU lift
champagne glasses fora
toast

MICHAEL
To the next Mayfair Diedre - or --- Aaron

AARONS face creases in affection Stunned Deeply moved They drink STU
examines the empty
champagne bottle-

STU
Anymore of this

MICHAEL nods - and heads out the room

STU
(calling after him casual)
I - uh - I assume either ones middle name is gonna be
Stu

MICHAEL WALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY PAST THE PORTRAITS

Passing the mirror he stops - and cocks his head The glass is turning
GREEN He raises a

finger and touches the glass His finger punctures the GREENNESS - and sinks
in up to his

knuckle Re hesitates - and slowly draws his finger out

THE GREENNESS POURS OUT into the hall knocking him down The hall is filling
up the GREENNESS

rising MICHAEL struggles as it rises above his head - above the portraits
and the witches

come out into the GREEN - surrounding him

DEBORAH

Michael Do what you can
SUZANNE

Michael Help us The door
AARON (OC)

Michael Michael look at me

MICHAEL IS ON THE FLOOR IN THE HALL
AARON is kneeling grasping him by the shoulders

AARON
Focus Michael

MICHAEL hones in on AARON - and points at the portraits
MICHAEL
It was them

AARON nods soberly - and helps him to his feet

MICHAEL
Dont tell Rowan about this

AARON
Michael Rowan should -

MICHAEL
NO shes pregnant Aaron shes got that to deal
with - and the
clinic she is not to hear about this (pause) dont
you think I know
she spends half her lite worrying about me
(a beat cools off)
Listening to my heart arent you
(AARON nods)
The Timex still ticking

AARON gives a somber grin - and they walk down the hall
FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP TO

INT THE CLINIC WEEK LATER - LATE NIGHT

Microscopes centrifuges test tube racks cubicles and refrigerators fill a
large dark
deserted room PAN TO

ROWAN AND LASHER STANDING AT A CORNER LAB TABLE

A single candle flickers She holds a closed long-stemted rose in her hand
LASHERS

transparent hand reaches out and melts into bars ROWAN shivers from the
union

LASHER
(hypnotic)
Imagine The sun (pause) It is morning It rises The
light wrashes
over you It warms you

ROWAN looks out the window Shes going far away Outside the room Past
the dark night

outside
LASHER
Now Rowan Give me the sun
She almost trembles with concentration And then --- the rose opens - the

petals spreading
wide
INT ROWAN AND MICHAELS BEDROOM SAME TIME

the WIND gusts outside the darkened windows MICHAEL lies in bed DAVID
COPPERFIELD in his

hands Tapping the book Uneasy Distracted He glances at the nighttable
clock - 1245 and

scowls He opens the book to the first page

MICHAEL
It was the best of times It was the worst of
times

A bitter grin darkens his face He rises and walks into the bathroom He
strips off his
pajamas and turns on the shower

INT THE CLINIC LAB SAME TIME

ROWAN holds the rose in one hand and lights it with a match It ignites
She drops it ona
counter and watches it burn - darkening and shriveling to a curled black ash

LASHER (UNSEEN)
Now my love --- see it as It was

Her eyes never leave the burnt remains - but brighten in concentration
Deep shining tunnels

LASHER (UNSEEN)
See the memory of life

Her body tingles with a remarkable force - and the blackned petals start to
uncurl - and

brighten to a pink - then a vibrant rich red Alive again ROWAN shivers -
her body goes limp

and she smiles

LASHER (UNSEEN)
(delighted)
You see You see
(a beat softly)
Rowan think what the child might do

INT THE MANSION - THE BATHROOM SAME TIME

MICHAEL - naked freshly showered his face lathered with shaving cream The
antique mirror on

the wall is completely fogged from the hot steamy running water in the sink
He begins to rub

the mirror clear His eyes widen - as rub by rub he reveals -

A monstrous tableau in the mirrorr A deep hellish landscape of nightsarish
creatures —

part-human part-grotesqueri - tortured screaming silently They turn and
see him and start

flying toward him at impossible speed
MICHAEL squeezes his eyes shut

MICHAEL
(like a litany)
I - AM - STANDING - IN - THE - BATHROOM

He opens his eyes The mirror reflects only his lathered face and the
bathroom A deep sigh

A long beat He picks up a razor - and starts at his cheekbone As the razor
descends shaving

the lather off -

there is nothing beneath the rather in tb mirror No cheek - just
BLACKNESS He stares in

shock Another stroke removes more lather revealing more of the VOID He
is mesmerized - and

cant stop- shaving faster until all the lather is gone - and the upper half
of his face

floats above a blackt hole in the mirror And suddenly -

- the grotesqueries are trying to squeeze through the black hole with ear-
splitting HOWLS -

hands and arms and talons pulling and ripping at each other fighting to be
the first to

escape

MICHAEL grabs the mirror off the wall and hurls it to the floor shattering
it SILENCE He

steadies himself catching his breath Then he hesitantly brings a hand up
and feels his jaw

his cheeks and lip A deep breath He turns off the water - and walks out of
the room

EXT THE MAYFAIR GROUNDS THE FOLLOWING MORNING
Two WORKMEN are inside the dry scrubbed swimming pool on ladders applying a
new coat of blue

sealant to the sides

MICHAEL AND STU ON THE SIDE PORCH
sipping coffee MICHAEI has a distracted frown

STU
Donnas gonna meet me in Key West so Ill leave
here a week
before Christmas and be back on the fourth Okay
MICHAEL gives a distracted nod STU eyes him carefully

STU
Whats wrong Mike

MICHAEL shakes his head dismissively

STU
Cmon - you havent been able to lie to me since you
asked Martha Rutledge
out behind my back in tenth grade

MICHAEL sighs deeply Lips pursed Wanting to speak

MICHAEL
Im getting --- left behind

STU
Left behind This about Rowan

MICHAEL
Yes (pause) Partly Its - its -
(a beat)
Stu - do you believe in ---

STUS eyes shift to something behind MICHAEL - his expressiofl quizzical
MICHAEL cocks his
head at STU - and turns

ROWAN STANDS IN THE PORCH ENTRANCE BEHIND THEM
Stock still Pale Drawn Shes been listening

STU
Hi there Want coffee

ROWAN and MICHAELS eyes meet Then --- OC - CRASH ROWAN and MICHAELS eyes
are locked
STU - turns to the sound

ANGLE - THE SWIMMING POOL

where a WORKER - up on a ladder - stares down frowning at the can of sealant
that has fallen

- its thick blue-green contents spreading out on the bottom of the pool

BACK TO THE PORCH

STU
What now

He walks toward the pool leaving ROWAN and MICHAEL alone

MICHAEL
(simmering anger)
When aid you get home last night

ROWAN
What were you talking about

MICHAEL
Yyou look terrible Youre exhausted You practically
live at the goddamn
clinic (pause) Even pregnant women who arent
doctors know that You
cant -
STU (OC)
Mike Better cmere

He stares at her - hurt angry baffled - and walks off
EXT DOWN IN THE POOL - MOMENTS LATER
MICHAEL STU and the WORKERS watch as the puddle of spilled blue sealant on
the pool floor
begins to shrink Huh
MICHAEL

It cracked the bottom Stuffs seeping down through a
crack
Almost all the sealant is gone - revealing cracks where the can hit MICHAEL
taps the cracks
with his foot - and STU grabs him as part of the pool caves in leaving a
hole
MICHAEL lowers a ladder inte the hole It hits bottom

STU
Careful

MICHAEL descends OUT OF VIEW STU glances up and there is ROWAN - staring
down at him

expressionless

MICHAEL (OC)
Somebody built a kind ot room down here

INT BENEATH THE POOL SAME TIME

MICHAEL stands in a dark dank enclosure of ancient timbers - three toot
square six feet high

He turns - and trips over something

BACK UP TOP AT THE HOLE IN THE POOL - MOMENTS LATER

MICHAEL (OC)
Hey - gimme a hand

MICHAEL appears struggling with an old slimy wooden crate STU grabs an
end and slides it

onto the pool

INT THE MANSION - A STORAGE ROOM MINUTES LATER

ROWAN and MICHAEL - crowbar in hand - stand over the crate

MICHAEL
Dovetails Gotta be a hundred years old

ROWAN
Go ahead
He looks at her searching her face

MICHAEL
Somethings wrong with you

ROWAN
(flaring)
Nothing is wrong with me I know somethings in there

and so do you

She grabs the crowbar - and pries the lid loose She yanks the lid off - and
they rear back
coughing choking

MICHAEL
Jesus Christ

They slowly come back leaning in for a look at the contents A dozen old
thick masan jars
with air-tight wax seals

ROWAN takes them out and sets them on the floor They are filled with
greenish viscous fluid

Its hard to see inside - a 100 years of sediment has been stirred up But
things are

settling it the jars Things are becoming visable

ROWAN
Michael --- look

The jars are filled with HEADS - skulls covered with slimy flesh Jellyish
rheumy eyes Hair
drifting like seaweed ROWAN and MICHAEL stare A long beat

ROWAN
Marguerite

MICHAEL looks at her - uncomprehending

ROWAN
Marguerite Carlotta said - Margutrite was something
ofa
practitioner herself She meant - like a doctor ---
Like ---
Suddenly - MICHAEL violently twists the top off a jar HISSSS They both

gag at the fumes

ROWAN
Michael --- no

He plunges his bare hand into the muck and pulls out a head His fingers
sink into the skin A
SEARING FLASH OF WHITE - INTO
INT A ROOM IN THE MANSION AS IF MICHAEL WERE THERE

MARGUERITE and JULIEN stand over a MANS corpse lying on a table LASHER
hovers expectantly

MARGUERITE takes a crude surgical tool servers the head and holds it up by
the hair LASHER

is brightening swirling round and round the head

MARGUERITE
Now my love - Now

LASHER dives into the head - like a vapor sucked inside The lifeless eyes
suddenly glimmer -
and come to life

LASHERS VOICE (FROM BEHIND THE EYES)
I am here Marguerite I can see

But the eyes start to flicker and dim like a dying light

LASHERS VOICE
(a plaintive cry)
NoNO pleeeeease I am going slipping The
feeling Oh
the feeling NOOOO

And now there is only death in the eyes again

BACK TO ROWAN AND MICHAEL

MICHAEL drops the head It breaks like a rotten melon He is horror-
stricken wiping his hands

frantically on his shirt

MICHAEL
He went into the dead Saw with their eyes - used
them

ROWAN - terrified - reaches for him - but he pushes her away Me grabs at the
jars inspecting
them one after another

MICHAEL
This one

Through the glass a head stares out at him - its state far superior to the
others the hair

brown and wavy the face grotesquely beautiful He opens the jar - and pulls
it out ANOTHER

FLASH OF WHITE Inro

INT DIEDRES ROOM AS IF MICHAEL WERE THERE

A naked MALE CORPSE lies on the brass bed - mottled lifeless yet alive
pulsing with LASHERS

spirit MARGUERITE stands naked at the bedside JULIEN stands beside her in
elegant attire -
with a look of twistad fascination and anticipation

The CORPSE beckons to MARGUERITE She climbs on the bed and mounts it The
grey hands move
with clumsy effort pawing at her She begins to move in a steady rhythm

LASHER VOICE (WITHIN THE CORPSE)
Marguerit - I can feel you

JULIEN
(leaning in face ablaze)
Faster Marguerite Faster FASTER

MARGUERITE speeds up - but soon the CORPSES hands slip to the bed
lifeless Tears fill
MARGUERITES eyes JULIEN smashes the bedpost in anger and storms away

BACK TO ROWAN AND MICHAEL
MICHAEL still holds the skull eye to eye

MICHAEL
Jesus - he tried to fuck her and Julien - Julien was
there -
like like an overseer

ROWAN suddenly grabs the head - and huris it to tbe floor Glass and flesh
and bone smash
against the floorboards

INT THE TALMASCA GARDEN LATER THAT DAY - DUSK

ROWAN and MICHAEL watch AARON as he paces - his face a study in
concentraticn He finally
turns to MICHAEL

AARON
What have the witches always asked of you

MICHAEL
Go back Michael Do what you can

AARON
Yes - and you have
(turns to ROWAN)

Do you see He was passing over into death - but
the witches

sent him back - to the one person they knew had the
power to

save him and they gave him the power to show you
what no

one else could

He grabs MICHAEL by the wrists and raises them high

AARON
With his hands
ROWAN
But why would they do that

AARON leans and smells a rose Thinking A long beat

AARON
To warn you

ROWANS face creases in confusion AARON turns to MICHAEL -

AARON
Youve always said you felt goodness in them - that the
witches
brought you and Rowan together Isnt that right
(MICHAEL nods emphatically)
Theyre reaching out to you Rowan

ROWAN
But it doesnt make sense They - they used Lasher
they conspired
with him

AARON

Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last
breath

They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre
withered inside

herself Carlotta killing and stunting her own flesh
and blood surely

they sense the child you carry - and the life it might
lead in Lashers

grasp (pause) Maybe in death they feel remorse
for the evil they

embraced in life

MICHAEL and ROWAN turn to each other AARON is pacing again
AARON
(excited)
It feels right (pause) There is a continuum Rowan
Youre part
of them
(halts a long beat)
They want you to stop Lasher
The concept sends them all deep into SILENCE
FADE TO BLACK
FADE UP TO
INT ECU - ONE OF THE ANCIENT HEADS
foating in its jar Calipers dip into the jar PULL OUT to

ROWAN IN A WINDOWLESS ROOM AT THE RESEARCH CLINIC
as she extracts a chunk of flesh She prepares a slide specimen placing it
under a large

microscope She depotits a specimen in a centrifuge and turns it on
WHIRRRR she programs

the computer - and columns of figures and symbols start filling the monitor
She eyes the

Screen and - LASHERS spectral face appears within the glass

LASHER
And now - do you know

ROWANS face hardens She stares back defiantly

ROWAN
I know that youre evil

LASHER
(poignant)
I only wanted to see as others do feel as others
do (sighs) but
Marguerite could not help me Nor Julien

ROWAN
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you

LASHER
(his melancholy smile)
No my love I want nothing more of the dead
(a long beat)
I want you to --- chang me

ROWAN falls silent - caught off-balance

LASHER

I have kept this from you until now You had to learn
the

magnificence of your powers first You had to see for
yourself

what you are capable of

(a beat)

Think Rowan - think of the rose - and the fire - and

Stu (pause)

You gave Michael life again - you give life to the
ehild within you
(a teat)
Give me life Make me flesh

Shes stunned He wafts out of the screen - floating round her like a
sheath She backs away
from him He follows

ROWAN
Its impossible You want me to - to make you into
something youre
not You - you have no substance - you have no cells
no structure
He circles round her
swept up

her powers

something

so

that keeps a

me here

LASHER is

for me

She is up

its very

She

everywhere —-

An unearthly courting dance She is swaying being
LASHER
Ive waited for you - the one whose science could match

(sighs)
Do you know what its like - to sense the majesty of

sublime just beyond your reach to float in a dream
«promise half-hidden in its shadows-
(a forlorn moan)

I did not choose to be such as this Suzanne brought

called to me

ROWAN
But have I Ever
all around her - caressing her

LASHER
Not with your voice nobut you do not need a voice

Only the beat of your heart That is your voice to me

against the wall nov enveloped by him

first

LASHER
--- and I have heard you from the beginning from
beat
ROWAN
(swooning)
I love Michael
LASHER
(seductive tinged with menace)
Then help me--- for his sake

His sexual perfection has her floating eyes drooping He kisses her

deeply

Only me

ROWAN
You mustnt hurt him Mustnt - mustnt hurt

LASHER
Focus all your powers on me Rowan until it is done
ROWAN

Only you

LASHER
Change me Rowan and we can change everything

Brightening he fuses with her - two entities becoming one And she
surrenders to him

INT ROWANS LAB HOURS LATER

ROWAN lies on the floor Her eyes open She rises groggily and drops
her chair Cocks
her head her senses keen

ROWAN
Lasher
(SILENCE)
Lasher Come to me

SILENCE She smiles cunningly - and nods understanding

ROWAN
(thinking out loud)
You cant You use yourself up in the passion
(pause)
You need time

She starts rapidly typing at the computer The screen shows -
hypothesis to examine secondary growth activity

cells induced by unknown catalyst -

and resultingly deduce nature of catalyst

and its reanimative authority

The computer shuttles ROWAN types -

posit if hypothesis is successful

what is probabiliy data will disclose

specific procedure for destruction of catalyst

The computers shuttles Then appearing on the screen -

oe

looks down and smiles warmly

ROWAN

into

She shows a faint smile of tritamph She sits back - puts her hands on her

Maybe Aaron is right Maybe they are trying to help

Can you feel
them
(her face hardens with resolution)

I swear to you - you will never know him When you

come into the

world he will be gone This is my promise to you

She rises - flicks switches on some hi-tech machines turns back to the
keyboard - and types -
begin hypothesis
DISSOLVE TO

The mansion is almost new The trees are turning fall colors Leaves are
falling PAN TO

THE GARDEN

where the emerald bush is blooming again - small crimson buds sprouting from
the center at the

bright green flowers

Standing beside a taxi STU rubs his hands together

STU
A few hours and Ill be wasting away in Margaritaville
Oh

MICHAEL
(very low-keyed)
Just dont fall off any ladders

A long silent look between them

STU
(soothing)
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that I mean

ROWAN

Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them MICHAEL seems to
pull inside himself

Cool Aloof

ROWAN

She leans in and gives STU a big htag and a kiss

STU

MICHAEL S mood makes everything awkward Everyone sneaking glances STU
finally wraps
MICHAEL up in a hug

STU
You two be good to each other

And he gets into the taxi ROWAN and MICHAEL watch silently till it goes OUT
OF VIEW ROWAN
turns round and stares at the house

ROWAN
God Michael - its so beautiful Itll be weird
without anybody tromping
around in there huh

She turns to MICHAEL He nods faintly They stare across the gulf between
them Trying to

link up He scratches his cleft with his thumb She grins and steps to him
Her arms going

round him

ROWAN
(softly)
Hi
MICHAEL
(a faint smile)
Hi (pause) You - you wanna get some breakfast

Gotcha

He steps back - and heads fcr the Mercedes ROWAN winces

ROWAN
Michael -

And she watches him get in the car and speed away

EXT DOWNTOWN NEW ORLEANS LATER THAT MORNING

MICHAEL with a sad grin looking in a department store window at an
incongruous Christmaas

display - Santa Claus in his sleigh saxophone in hand riding down a replica
of bBurbon Street

INT ROWANS LAB SAME TIME

ROWAN stares frowning at a monitor full of symbols She sits back weary
closes her eyes

Rubs them

LASHER (UNSEEN)
Go on Rowan Go on

ROWAN
(smacks the desk
Leave me alone

LASHER flickers into sight she turns and hurls a notebook at him It goes
through him and
hits the wall

LASHER
What is wrong

ROWAN
Wrong Science is not magic

LASHER
(a beat sottly)
I do not understand

ROWAN
You went into the cells --- and you changed them
How
LASHER
There was no thought There was no act (pause) That
is not
what I am
ROWAN
I dont know what you are
LASHER
(passionate)
That is what you must discover (pause) see what I am
my love

With all your power - see me and know what I am
He approaches She brace herself - holding her ground - not backing off

LASHER
Do not be atraid Fear is not for you

She straightens tightening some psychic grip She holds her hands out and
frames his head His

face comes to hers - meets it - then merges with hers - And they start to
rise - joined as they

are - floating up

ROWANS POV - A TRILLION FLECKS OF COLORED LIGHT

Dense dazzling The POV moves deeper - the density lessensfewer
particles frenzied

darting in a greenish haze Deeper - terrifying speed now - zooming
plummeting toward

nothingness OBLIVION -a piercing SCREAM-

ROWAN - SUSPENDED IN THE AIR WITH LASHER

SCREAMS - lurches free of him and falls to the floor dazed LASHER swoops
down to her

enfolding her gently
LASHER
Dont stop

She weakly waves him off - gulping for breath

ROWAN
No

LASHER
(intense urgent)
Tell me what I am Rowan

She gazes at him painfully shakes her head vehemently

LASHER
Rowan Rowan

She covers her face with her hands and turns away from him LASHERS face
darkens with anger -
and jealousy

LASHER
(cool anger)
You are thinking of him

And she suddenly rises - and storms out of the room
EXT THE MANSION DAY - AN HOUR LATER

ROWAN comes quickly through the gate She walks inside the house and down
the main hall

ROWAS
Michael Michael

Passing the LIVING ROOM entrance something out at the corner of her eye
stops her She
turns

ROWANS POV - THE LIVING ROOM

where a magnificent Christmas tree rises to the ceiling covered with globes
and stars and

tinsel so the whole room seems to shine

ROWAN
walks slowly toward it - overwhelmed tears filling her eyes

MICHAEL (OC)
Nice huh

She turns and sees MICHAEL and rushes into his arms
INT MICHAEL AND ROWANS ROOM LATER THAT DAY
They lie in bed in each others arms Private Thoughts A long beat

MICHAEL lets out a deep
sigh
MICHAEL
Youve gone away from me Ro Someplace I dont know
how to get to

ROWAN
Its not true You have to believe me

MICHAE is preparing his thoughtsmaking his mind up

MICHAEL

I want us to leave This isnt home Rowan I could
tear the house

down and start from scratch - and it still wouldnt be
home I want

to go back to San Francisco - I want our child born
somewhere thats

free of death Thats all there is here Its in the
ground and the glass

and the steel and the ground (pause) I want to leave
If Lasher follows

So be it Let him face us in a place where we belong

MICHAEL waits And - ROWAN looks away from him

ROWAN
(her voice is sad but hard)
I cant

MICHAEL
Thats not good enough Why not

ROWAN
(suddenly erupting)
I cant leave now Dont ask me to explain I just
cant

That does it Hes had it He rips the covers off and stands Grabs his
pants and starts
pulling them on

MICHAEL
Ive never asked you to explain yourself - because you
used to let me

inside But Im on the outside now you put me
there
ROWAN
(melting to urgency)
Michael - please - just a little longer Dont
leave
MICHAEL

(bitter sarcastic)
Why bother to ask Ro Why dont you just make me
stay
ROWAN
Stop it

MICHAEL
How ‘bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist

ROWAN
(flaring)
You bastard

He whirls round and grabs her violently by the shoulders

MICHAEL
You could kill me - right now couldnt you
couldnt you
(shakes her violently)

Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher Answer me
ROWAN
(torn up)
Michael - Im sorry Just give me -
MICHAEL
No

They stare at each other - miles apart A long beat

MICHAEL
When youre ready to let me back into your heart Ill
come
back to you

He hustles his shirt and shoes on and storms out ROWAN watches him go as
tears stream down her
face She runs out after him - down the stairs

ROWAN
MICHAEL

The front door slams shut Her face narrows in anger - fury rising as she
turns and stares at

the Christmas tree POP One of the shiny globes explodes POP Another
goes POP

LASHER appears hovering above the tree smiling The angel at the top of
tree flies off and
smashes against the wall

LASHER
You are magnificent my love

As ROWAN stands entranced in her powers LASHER swirls round the tree The
ornaments sway in

the maelstrom - tinsel and globes and trinkets flying off srashing
everywhere Bits of glass

fill the air like colored snow LASHER encircle ROWAN She swoons to the
floor - and he
joins with her

MICHAEL and AARON sit in a LOUNGE MICHAEL looks drawn and weary He taket
a swig froma
drink and grimaces

MICHAEL

in her life
(bitter) well - Im already out of her life

AARON
Nothing was ever more false

MICHAEL
(leaning in almost desperate)
Then tell me Is it Lasher

AARON starts solemnly - and finally shakes his head

AARON
I only know she loves you - desperately

MICHAEL fingers his glass A self-loathing grin shows

MICHAEL
Ill probably be back in a weekbut I cant spend
Christmas in

day
AARON
Every day (grins) twice
MICHAIL
(a beat)
Aaron - do you believe in God

He reaches out and covers MICHAELs hand with his own

ARRON

EXT SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT TERMINAL NIGHT
MICCHAEL wasks out into the fog He gets in a taxi and tells the DRIVER -

MICHAEL
On the hill 2712 Fairmont
EXT THE MAYFAIR ESTATE SAME TIME

AARON comes through the grate Up to the door KNOCK-KNOCK Knocks again
SILENCE He
walks along the porch peering in the windows He heads back down the walk

The emerald bushs crimson buds have bloomed into huge flowers He teaches
to pick one - and

is pricked by a thorn blood trickles from his finger He heads toward the
gate

INT SAN FRANCISCO - MICHAELS HOUSE NIGHT

Everything covered with sheets MICHAEL wanders a half-empty scotch bottle
in his hand
singing softly

MICHAEL
I left my heart in ---

He stops - his face creasing - gears turrning in his head
INT MICHAELS ATTIC A MINUTE LATER

MICHAEL digging in boxes He finds what he wants - and yanks his tathers
singed firemans
helmet in both hands THE SEARING WHITE-HOT FLASH - AND

INT A FIERY FLAMING BUILDING AS IF MICHAEL WERE THERE

MICHAELS FATHER tosses the GIRL to the safety net Suddenly - the window is
blown in

shattering MICHAELS FATHER falls to the floor Above him the flames dance
- then everything

comes down on him

MICHAELS POV swerves up to the rafters There is LASHER hovering in the
flames in command

undulating in the deadly heat LASHER glances TO CAMERA (to MICHAEL) - and
smiles

MICHAEL
drops the helmet - as if burned - and races out

INT MICHAELS BEDROOM A MINUTE LATER
MICHAEL stands with the phone to his ear - revving like a madman - listening
to the RING on the

other end of the line

MICHAEL
Pick up the fucking phone Ro

INT THE MANSION - THE LIVING ROOM SAME TIME - NIGHT
ROWAN out cold on the floor The phone is RINGING Her eyes open She
struggles to her feet

Stubling into the hall - toward the phone And - BZZZ-KPIT-KPIT She
freezes

BZZZ-KPIT-KPIT Upstairs She turns to the stairs - hesitates - and
starts up

INT THE TALAMASCA HEADQUARTERS SAME TIME - NIGHT
A WOMAN stands with a phone AARON comes INTO FRME and takes it from her

ARRON (INTO THE PHONE)
Michael

INTERCUT between AARON and MICHAEL in his bedroom at a fever-pitch figuring
it out as he

rambles
MICHAEL
Aaron - lieten to me Its been Lasher - from the
start
AARON

What are you talk---

MICHAEL
He chose ME for ROWAN --- when I was a child
BACK TO ROWAN IN THE MANSION
on the second floor outside Diedres room BZZZ-KPIT rts in there
She walks inside
BZZZ-KPIT

BACK TO MICHAEL AND AARON ON THE PHONE

MICHAEL

Carlotta was too strong for Lasher She got Rowan away
from him -

to San Francisco but that took her away from me
too (pause)

Aaron - Lasher killed my father Thats what got me
and mother out

of New Orleans - and back to Rowan - so we would meet

(chilled to the bone)
Aaron his power His control

AARON
(equally chilled)
Rowan

MICHAEL
You have to warn her - this second Im catching the
next flight
back

BACK TO ROWAN IN DIEDRES ROOM
staring at a sheetrock wall - all senses primed BZZZ-KPIT suddenly she
SMASHES her fist

through - and starts tearing the wall away Ripping the last chunk away -
and there sits

GIFFORD - decapitated drenched in blood In his lap is the gold saw like a
platter - and

resting on it is his head The cat licks at the mouth wide open ina
scream

INT A CAB ON A HIGHWAY SAME TIME - LATE NIGHT

AARON speeds down the road LASHER suddenly appears beside him grinning
faintly AARON
glances at him stunned

LASHER
Petyr van Abel would have been proud of your devotion
Aaron
your compassion And I am grateful for them

ARRON looks back to the road trying to shut out the specter

LASHER
The Talamascas histories made Rowans nature clear to
her in a way
I never could and I am thanktul for that

AARONS face sinks in realization of a centuries-old folly

AARON
That is our purpose in all this

LASHER
Since the begxnning (sighs) We have been together a
long time
you and I And now it ends

The car suddenly swerves violently AARON fights for control As they skid
and sverve down
the road

LASHER
Rowan fights her feelings for me but her passion - her
power -
they conspire against her love And I grow stronger -

Finally - AARON wrestles back control of the car

AARON
(triumphant)
But there are still limits to your powers arent
there Some of
us are without desire - and we exhaust you --- dont
we
The car enters a tunnel Suddenly - up ahead - A BRICK WALL COMPLETELY FILLS
THE TUNNEL

AARON stiffens - floors the gas - and zooms through the wall It dissolves
as he passes

through The car exits the tunnel ARRON glances over at LAHER - and AARON
grins And -

- the steering goes AARON twists the wheel - but the car wont respond -
and hes heading
toward a steep embankmen

AARON
Irn right in the middle of the road Theres nothing
wrong with
the car

LASHER
Yes Let us wait and see

The car swerves off the road The cliffside looms

AARON
Im not afraid Lasher

AARON stares - unflinching - as the car barrels over the cliff soaring down
down The
ground racing up at him

AARON
I am not AFRAID

The car plows into the ground - and suddenly - AARON is staring at the
highways center-line as
he speeds along

LASHER
You are strong Aaron
(an evil smile)
but others are not so strong

And he vanishes AARONS face creases in confusion Huh A school bus
is coming up toward

them in the other direction on the other side of the road AARONS face
whitens

AARON
Lasher where are you Lasher LASHER

LASHER (UNSEEN)
If not for yourself then fear for the children

AARON can see the bus clearly now Packed with children And he can see the
sudden

uncomprehending look of terror on the DRIVERS face - as he inexplicably
loses control of the
bus It suddenly skids - and swerves out of lane - heading straight for a
head-on with AARON

AARON hesitates - uncertain - wavering - seconds to impact - and --- he
swerves out of the bus
path at the last moment -- sacrificing himself - flying off the cliff

INT THE MANSION - SAME TIME - LATE NIGHT

ROWAN stumbles out of Diedres room down the stairs freaked looking over
her shoulder And
- she freeses seeing something that isnt there Her face twists

BACK TO THE CLIFFSIDE - SAME TIME
AARONS car tumbles down through the air hits bottom - and EXPLODES in a
fireball

BACK TO ROWAN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS

as she is sent reeling to the floor Dazed fighting a blackout - sliding
down into her

dream

THE OPERATING ROOM IN ROWANS DREAM
ROWAN works feverishly on the OUT OF FRAME patient THE MASKED FIGURES watch
silently

ROWAN
I - I cant do it

The others urge her on - imploring encouraging her-

ROWAN
(pointing OUT OF FRAME frantic)
But look LOOK How can I do it

oc - a muffled CRY

TILT DOWN SLOWLY - the edge of the operating table comes INTO FRAME - and
lying on it a tiny

hand PULL OUT to REVEAL ALL for the first time It is a truly bizarre
entity the torso of

aman - with the head arms and legs toes and lingers of a tiny newborn

MASKED FIGURE
Go on Help him

MASKED FIGURE
Help us

ROWAN

A FIGURE removes its mask - it is MARGUERITE She takes a scalpel and cuts
the entity from

navel to callarbone then folds back the skin --- within the chest cavity

the emerald pendant

is where a heart should be ROWAN SCREAMS All but one of the FIGURES take

off their masks
they are the twelve MAYFAIR WITCHES - and JULIEN

JULIEN
Help him You were made for this

ROWAN
I cant do it How can I do it

SUZANNE
Stop doubting your power

Then - the remaining MASKED FIGURE speaks
MASKED FIGURE
No Dont listen to your words Rowan Listen to the
feeling

behind your words Listen to your heart

He removes his mask it is ARRON

AARON
It is not your power that you doubt When you say - I
cant do
it - you are saying - I MUST NOT DO IT You are

saying I WILL
NOT DO IT
(his warm kind smile)
This is what your heart tells you

ROWAN ON THE FLOOR AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS

coming groggily out of the dream She rises unsteadily And LASHER stands
before her Her

face hardens He starts toward her ROWAN stands her ground - sensing
danger

ROWAN
STOP

Lasher halts - shimmering Staring deep into one another

ROWAN
Aaron was in the dream A dream tilled with spirits
(pause) you killed
him didnt you

LASHER
(a beat)
It was an accident (smiles) Gifford too

She trembles Her tears come But - she steels herself A long beat
ROWAN
The portraits Lasher Why are the witches always
before a door

Tell me Lasher Now

LASHER
(his smile flashes)

They want to come back (pause) We have a pact - of
mutual desire

and consent The Mayfairs ar a beautiful tapestry
I have weaved

you all together - from the start (pause) I brought
Petyr Van Abel to

Suzanne He had genius in him Scientific precise
It was a perfect

start And on it has gone - father to mother sister
to brother father

to daughter

ROWAN shudders Turning ghostly pale

ROWAN
Oh god
LASHER
Julien was your father Your great-grandfather - your
grandfather
- and your father All one in the same That is why
he fought

carlotta for your life
ROWAN is shaken - backing up in horror

LASHER

The Mayfair pact Rowan when I am flesh - I will
unlock the

door - and the witches will come through

(soaring)

You are the key to the door for the witches - and for
me You are

the thirteenth witch

Laslirn glows brighter
LASHER
I will be --- perfect (pause) That is why I chose

Michael

ROWAN blanches Thrown for a loop LASHER smiles

LASHER
The boy who would turn his dreams into reality The
exquisite
imagination So aesthetic so vulnerable The boy so
special
he could see me (pause) And I knew he was the one ---
for us

(he smilas)
You thought it love at first sight (shakes his
head) I chose him
for you (pause) The union is human perfection

She doesnt quite get it shes revving furious confused
LASHER
I created you to create me --- and you have

And now ROWAN sees it all stumbling back terrified

LASHER
Its growing inside you Waiting to change
Waiting for me
And ROWAN turns - and runs A door SLAMS shut as she races toward it

LASHER (UNSEEN)
Did you think you could trick me my love

She whirls round - LASHER floats before her - glowing like never before - a
bright pulsating
emerald green

LASHER
You thought I could not see into your soul I made
your soul

ROWAN back up against the wall LASHER spreads out - huge dark roiling
Towering above her
the clock begins to chime MIDNIGHT GONG-GONG-GONG

LASHER
It is Christmas Eve my love The witching hour is at
hand
when Christ was born into the world - when the Word was
finally made Flesh --- and I would be born too I am
done

with waiting

He gathers force funnelling in on himself whirling like a tornado - and
streams toward her
like a jet of green vapor -

ROWAN

--- and the whirlwind jets up between her legs --- into her --- and
disappears She HOWLS in

unearthly pain - and falls to the floor Her water breaks - blood seeping
now from between her

legs -

ROWAN
(absolutely totally completely freaked)
Oh god - oh my god - no godddd NO

She SHRIEKS as a vicious contraction jolts her to her very being And ---
something is coming
out of her
Out it slides --- the ENTITY FROM HER DREAM On its back - bloody shining -
a man-sized head

its infant arms and fingers and legs and feet groping and and moving and ---
elongating and

growing with each breath as it cries the CRY from ROWANS dream ROWAN
slumps into

oblivion

FADE TO BLACK
FADE UP TO
EXT THE MANSION EARLY THE NEXT MORNING - CHRISTMAS DAY

TRACKING with MIHAEL
as he barrels through the gate and bursts inside the house

MICHAEL
ROWAN ROWAN

Racing down the hall he freezes - staring into the LIVING ROOM Everything
topsy-turvy A

carpet of broken colored glass and pine needles covers the floor He races
toward the stairs

and skids to stop - a thick pool of blood on the floor there MICHAEL races

back down the

hall

MICHAEL

EXT THE MANSION GARDEN MOMENTS LATER

MICHAEL races INTO FRAME - and stops - staring at a tall FIGURE - clad only
in pants - its back
to him

THER FIGURE

slowly turns round it is a man - delicate yet muscular but the skin the
expression the

texture ot him is brand-new newborn And his face is a perfect mix of ROWAN
and MICHAEL In

his hand he holds one at the newly-bloomed emerald-and-crimson flowers He
smiles

THE MAN
I made these

It is LASHERS voice He holds the flower to his nose and inhales deeply-
His brand-new face
lights with the most sensual of discoveries

LASHER THE MAN
Ahhh It is incredible is it not
(holds the flower out to MICHAEL)
Here For you Father
And MICHAEL knows He HOWLS and stampedes toward LASHER who waits with a
delighted

expresslon MICHAEL barrels into him - they go sprawling to the ground
MICHAEL pummeling him

tearing at him lost to murder and vengeance

MICHAEL
You fucking bastard You killed my child

But LASHER is laughing --- rejoicing in the sensations the pain the
movement the flesh

LASHER THE MAN
But I am your child I AM YOUR SON

MICHAEL
Where is Rowan Where is she

LASHER THE MAN
And this is pain Father you cannot hurt me No
one can

And LASHER rises lifting MICHAEL up like a toy - dangling him in the air

LASHER THE MAN
I am ALIVE Father

And he flings MICHAEL across the garden LASHER smiles and heads for
MICHAEL ungainly on his
new legs

ROWAN COMES CARWLING OUT OF THE HOUSE
- weakened haggard bloodied pale

ROWAN
Michael

LASHER - standing over MICHAEL - turns toward the sound - and MICHAEL tries
to crawl away

LASHER THE MAN
(grinning)
You want Michael

LASHER struts to MICHAEL and picks him up by the collar

LASHER THE MAN
Here Here he is

MICHAEL hangs still in LASHERS grip like the marionette LASHER jostles
him shakes him with

a smile

LASHES THE MAN
You could use some strings I think

ROWAN is trying to crawl but shes so weak
ROWAN
Put - him - down His - his heart

LASHER THE MAN
How is your heart Father Is the Timex still
ticking

He punches MICHAEL brutally in the chest And then strikes him again
MICHAEL HOWLS -

breathless eyes bulging- LASHER starts parading around the garden holding
MICHAEL in the air

like a broken marionette

LASHER THE MAN
(mad possessed overdosing on life)
Look at me Mother Am I not a wonder Something
new under the
sun The world has never seen the likes of me

MICHAEL
(a barely audible HISS)
A monster among men

LASHER
(suddenly expressionless cold)
Rowan and I will be together now My time has come

Your time is
gone

ROWAN
No Dont Lasher

LASHER strikes a deadly blow to MICHAELS chest MICHAEL seems to cave in
And LASHER hurls
MICHAEL into the pool

MICHAEL SINKS LIKE A STONE BENEATH THE WATER

Sinking into death for the second and last time And - the WITCHES seep out
in the water

surrounding him

MICHAEL
Let go Michael It is done - and he is beautiful
Perfect
DEBORAH
We can go through now Lasher will open the door and
bring us back- (pause) Goodbye Michael Let go now

Let go
The phantoms fade away Michael sinks to the bottom DEAD

BACK AT POOLSIDE

LASHER stands beaming and proud staring into the water ROWAN drags
herself to the pool -

and stares down in horror
ROWAN
Oh god nooooc00o0o

She tries to slide into the pool - but LASHER picks her up gently end
deposits her on the
grass

LASHER THE MAN
Mother - you must rest Youre still bleeding Rest
please

The WIND suddenly picks up The trees sway And then - the witches VOICES
swirl around
LASHER and ROWAN

SUZANNE (UNSEEN)
Lasher - bring us through

DEBORAH (UNSEEN)
Now lasher - it is our time

The VOICES beseech him coax him plead And LASHER smiles up at the sky -
-- a widening
cunning wicked smile

LASHER THE MAN
Your time Oh my foolish ones - but you are wrong
rt is my time
MINE I am unto myself - one of a kind (pause) And
I have Rowan
Who else do I need

SUZANNE (UNSEEN)
(anger in her voice and panic)
The pact Lasher The pact We have waited Now it is

our time
LASHER THE MAN
(a harsh laugh)
I have no time for your time Be gone
DEBORAH (UNSEEN)
(desperate)
Lasher - please Save us Bring us through
LASHER THE MAN
(suddenly vicious)
BE GONE - or I will send you where there are no worlds
at all
Go

The WIND dies SILENCE He turns and sees ROWAN dragging herself toward the
pool He strides
over and drags her away

ROWAN
(tries to shake free of him)
Let me go Michaelllllll

LASHER THE MAN

ENOUGH He is dead You are here for me now Michael

is
gone

ROWAN
(venomous spitting it out)

Ill destroy you I swear it If you dont kill me

Ill finda -

LASHER THE MAN
(stunned sincerely wounded)

Kill you You are my mother Do you think I

would hurt you

She twists out of his grasp and sprawls on the ground Glaring
And then -

The WIND comes up again Whipping the leaves around Gathering
LASHER looks to the

SUZANNE (UNSEEN)
Rowan - he has cheated us all (pause)
thirteenth
Use your anger Use the power USE US

ROWAN slowly rises as if pulled up The sky darkens The WIND
LASHER watches like a
child turning round and round - and stares now into his mother

LASHER THE MAN
(soft)
Mother

ROWAN glares it him Her body seems to harden Her eyes flare
FLASHES - anda
hard rain pours down LASHERS expression changes Doubt

LASHER THE MAN
(sott heartrending)
I am your flesh These are your eyes

But she is steel More than steel She is an energy the earth
before And he
sees it in her fact His melancholy smile comes

LASHER THE MAN
(tender loving)
I am your son I would not wound you I
ever

ROWAN
(eerily soft)

up at him

force

sky perplexed surprised His newborn eyes wide and curious

You are the

swirls

s eyes

LIGHTNING

Fear

has not known

could not -
I know (pause) you are my son -
LASHER almost melts at her words He reaches out to her -
ROWAN
(turning cold as death)

- and may god forgive me

He freezes - arms outstretched mouth agape She looks to the sky

ROWAN
(imperious)
Now Now
The WIND is whipped into a frenzy A branch is torn from a tree - and

crashes into LASHER

He stumbles Thorned bushes are ripped from the ground and tear at his
flesh His blood

runs

In the sky a doten whirling funnels appear descending like avenging WINDS
LASHER watches -

his face darkening ROWANS arms rise pointing majestically like a conductor
directing a

terrible symphony of destruction The tunnels follow her movements whirling
and gliding And

terror rains down on LASHER

TREES FLAGSTONE ROCKS THE WROGHT-IRON FENCE - EVERYTHING IS BEING
UPROOTED TORN APART - AND
SENT WHIRLING SLASHING AND CRASHING DOWN ON LASHER He falls to the ground

LASHER THE MAN
MOTHER MY FLESH DO NOT DO THIS

ROWAN is ominous - eyes riveted on him She points to the house - and it
starts to come apart

SHINGLES TIMBERS WINDOWS TEARING LOOSE FLYING THROUGH THE1 AIR -
SHOWERING DOWN ON

LASHER --- RIPPING HIM APART

LASHER THE MAN
The pain my beautiful flesh

Flesh tearing off bones bones pulled from sockets His very being coming
apart

disintegrating His cries begin to fade in the cacophony ROWAN S eyes
never leave him

Her arms swing round and she points at what remains at her son The
funnels descend on

LASHER in a frenzy Everything is obscured by the cloud of dust ard matter
Than - a final

fading SHRIEK come - and than --- SILENCE

ROWANs hands drop to her side She seems to lessen to settle back into
herself The
funnels fade the dust settles and where LASHER lay - NOTHING The
garden is gone The
mansion is gone Total destruction

ROWAN comes out of her trance

She races to the pool and dives in and resurfaces with MICHAELS lifeless
body She drags him

up onto the ground - and frantically tries to revive him over and over again

Finally - she SMASHES his chest as she did long ago - but MICHAEL lies still
She drops upon

him exhausted - weeping inconsolable Then -- she looks up to the sky -
fury and tears in
her eyes

ROWAN

You betrayed him All of you Look LOOK AT HIM
He

believed there was goodnese in you - and you BETRAYED

him

She stands seething - like a volcano about to erupt Thinking Focusing
Something is

coming together inside her she is remarkable She reaches to the sky -
ROWAN
I AM THE THIRTEENTH I AM THE KEY COME THROUGH

THE DOOR ALL OF YOU - COME - THROUGH - THE - DOOR

And the fabric of the sky tears An ererald haze shows beyond it Arid
the PHANTOM-WITCHES

come soaring through the gash in the world - speeding toward their
mistress

ROWAN
All of us are one - from the beginning to now So I
command you -—
come into me Mlake THIRTEEN ONE

AND THE WITCHES SWOOP DOWN - AND DIVE INTO ROWAN - FILL HER - BECOME HER
SHE BRIMS WITH
POWER ALMOST A CELESTIAL GLOW

She kneels beside MICHAEL takes his hands and presses them against her
heart Her tears
cascade down her cheeks

ROWAN
Come back to me Michael Please Michael --- come
back I love you
I LOVE YOU MICHAEL Oh God - COME BACK TO ME

She leans down and kissea him - deeply deep as their love - long long
long

And ---
MICHAEL opens his eyes Rasping coughing shaking with the new life Rowna
has given him
ROWAN on her knees lifts him up and cradles his head in her chest

MICHAEL
(barely a whisper)
Lasher Where --- where is ---

ROWAN
(loving soothing)
Its alrightits airight Hes gone Michael
Gone

SLOW ZOOM INTO ROWANS FACE

ROWAN
Everythings gone Michael Everything except for us
(pause)
But were here Together You andl
HOLD ON ECU OF ROWAN
She smiles strangely and --- HER FACE FLICKERS AND THEN FROM SOME NEW

INNER CURRENT HER
FACE STROBES B1ZARRELY WITH THE FACES OF TWELVE OTHERS WHO CAME LONG BEFORE
HER

ROWAN
(very very softly)
Just you and

FADE TO BLACK

THE END
