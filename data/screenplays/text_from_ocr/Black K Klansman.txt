CLOSE —- KWAME TURE

towering at Six Feet-Four with an infectious smile and
Flawless Dark Skin hes oozing Charisma out of every pore
He stands behind a small podium

KWAME TURE (CONTD)
--Im here to tell you this evening
it is time for you to stop running
away from being Black You are
College Students you should think
It is time for you to understand that
you as The growing Intellectuals The
Black Intellectuals of this Country
you must define Beauty for Black
People

The Black Students in The Audience are laser focused on him

KWAME TURE (CONTD)
Beauty is defined by someone with a
Narrow Nose Thin Lips White Skin
You aint got none of that If your
Lips are Thick Bite them in Hold
your Nose Dont drink Coffee because
it makes you Black

The Audience laughs Loving it

KWAME TURE (CONTD)
Your Nose is Boss your Lips are
Thick you are Black and you are
Beautiful

Everyone cheers including Ron

KWAME TURE (CONTD)
We want to be like The White people
that oppress us in this Country and
since they hate us we hate
ourselves You dig Tarzan I remember
that when I was a Boy I used to go
see Tarzan Movies on Saturdays White
Tarzan used to Beat up The Black
Natives I would sit there yelling
Kill The Beasts Kill The Savages
Kill Em Actually I was saying
Kill Me It was as if a Jewish Boy
watched Nazis taking Jews off to
Concentration Camps and cheered them
on Today I want The Chief to beat
The Hell out of Tarzan and send him
back to Europe But it takes time to
become Free of The Lies and their
shaming effect on Black Minds It
takes time to reject the most
Important Lie that Black People
inherently cant do the same things
White People can do unless White
People help them

The Audience laughing overwhelmed shouting back support A
ROAR from The Crowd Ron finds himself clapping along

RON STALLWORTH
Right on Right On

KWAME TURE (CONTD)
The White West are the most Violent
People on The Face of The Earth They
have used Violence to get everything
they have And yet theyre the First
to talk about Violence I never get
caught up with Violence As a matter
of fact one of my Favorite Quotes
that stops all the talk about it is
from Sartre What then did you
expect when you unbound The Gag that
muted The Black Mouth That they
would chant your praises

KWAME TURE (CONTD)
Did you think that when those Heads
that our Fathers had forcefully bowed
down to the ground were raised again
you would find adoration in their
eyes Thats Jean-Paul Sartre not
me

Ron looks around at everyone caught up in Kwames spell

KWAME TURE (CONTD)
If a White Man wants to Lynch Me
thats his Problem If hes got The
Power to Lynch Me thats My Problem
Racism is not a question of Attitude
its a question of Power

Ron is struck by the remark

KWAME TURE (CONTD)
It is White Power that makes The Laws
and it is Violent White Power in the
form of armed White Cops that
enforces their Laws with Guns and
Nightsticks The vast majority of
Negroes in this Country live in
Captive Communities and must endure
their conditions of Oppression
because and only because they are
Black and Powerless Now We are being
shot down like Dogs in the streets by
White Racist Policemen We can no
longer accept this Oppression without
retribution The War in Vietnam is
Illegal and Immoral Id rather see a
Brother Kill a Cop than Kill a
Vietnamese At least hes got a
reason for Killing The Cop When you
Kill a Vietnamese youre a Hero and
you dont even know why you Killed
him At least if you Kill a Cop
youre doing it for a reason

Another Applause Break Ron listens challenged torn

KWAME TURE (CONTD)
Were tired of trying to prove things
To White People Were tired of
trying to explain to White People
that were not going to hurt them We
are concerned with getting things We
want The thing we have to have to
function The question is Will White
People overcome their Racism and
allow for that to happen in this
Country If not We have no choice
but to say very clearly Move on
over or Were going to move over

Let me remind you of a Poem By Prime
Minister Winston Churchill read when
England was getting ready to Attack
Germany It Was written by a Black
Man named Claude McKay from Jamaica
and He wrote it for Black People It
is called IF WE MUST DIE It is our
Poem Today in The United States If
We must Die let it not be like Hogs
Hunted and Penned in an Inglorious
Spot While round us Bark The Mad
Hungry Dogs Makin Their Mock at Our
Accursed Lot If We must Die O let
Us Nobly Die So that Our Precious
Blood may not be Shed In Vain then
even The Monsters We Defy Shall be
constrained to Honor us though Dead O
Kinsmen We Must meet The Common
Foe Though Far Outnumbered Let Us
Show Us Brave And for their Thousand
Blows deal One Deathblow What though
before us lies The Open Grave Like
Men well face The Murderous
Cowardly Pack Pressed to The Wall
dying but Fighting Back
