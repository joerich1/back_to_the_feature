scrub brush or canyon until it finds

large squatting in the middle of nowhere

The CAMERA KEEPS FLYING until it homes in on a

-pushing through it to find

-what‘s basically an open town hall-type gathering area

One soldier is holding court with a group of BRITISH
OFFICERS He is a damned good-looking man LIEUTENANT
TEMPLETON “FACE” PECK

FACE
-two or three years ago I was in
Scotland outside of Glasgow at this bar
called the Ivory Tick

BRITISH OFFICER
I was just in Glasgow and I’ve never
heard of it

FACE

Right well I’m getting to that the
place was owned by this old Scottish
prizefighter Kenneth “The Haymaker”
McHaymond He was known for having a
hell of a knock-out punch and he’s kind
of a surly guy and I was out minding my
own business with some other GIs and he
tells me that he hates us Yanks and we
need to get the hell out of his pub

BRITISH OFFICER
Sounds like my kind of guy

All the British officers start laughing Face takes it in
stride the consummate storyteller

ee OF

a

e tee HHH HH

FACE
Anyway me being the proud American I am
I tell him where he can take his pint of
Newcastle and stuff it

The Brits taugh again enthralled

FACE (CONTD)
So this big bastard tells me he’s gonna

knock me out with one punch “One
punch” I say and he says “That’s right
‘one punch” Well I always recognize a

bet when I see one so I say to him “Why
don’t you put your money where your mouth
is I own the armed forces lightweight
title and one thing I know this handsome
face can do is take a punch So if you
knock me out with one punch I’11l pay you
five-hundred dollars”

The two Brits snicker

BRITISH OFFICER
And what’d Mr Haymaker wager in return
if you withstood his punch

FACE
Why do you think the pub is now named
“Templeton Pecks”

They all look at the nameplate on his uniform Lt
Templeton Peck and then start laughing

FACE (CONT’D)
That’s a true story

BRITISH OFFICER
(to his mates)
There is a Peck’s pub there I think

Just then an American Colonel JOHN “HANNIBAL” SMITH
staggers up to them a little drunk

HANNIBAL
You’‘re full of shit

FACE
Whoa easy there Colonel I think
youve had a little too much from
whatever flask youve tucked away

HANNIBAL

know-your-allies discussion here

Hannibal holds up a finger

HANNIBAL
I guarantee I can knock you out with one
punch
Face sizes him up
FACE

Thanks but I don’t think you’ve got a
pub to name after me so

HANNIBAL

FACE

Hannibal spins toward the officer

HANNIBAL

BRITISH OFFICER

HANNIBAL

Face takes off his jacket while Hannibal and the Brit
count out the money and put it on a nearby table

those winnings

BRITISH OFFICER

Hannibal gets ready trying to focus on Face

FACE
“Do you mind hitting my right side My
left’s kinda my calling card Itd be
like punching a Renoir

HANNIBAL
Whatever

Hannibal shifts his stance to favor his left-hand
Everyone waits tension building in the room quite a
crowd is drawn Face gets himself pumped ready for it
for just a moment we’re not sure Hannibal’s going to be
able to steady himself enough to even throw one

Then suddenly the colonel launches a haymaker that starts”
from around his belt area WHAMMM

QUICK SHOTS Face drops Hannibal scoops up the money
Walks out of the tent The British officers just look
after him defeated and we

DISSOLVE TO

EXT BARRACKS - NIGHT

Face walks down a row of barracks with an ice pack to his
right jaw

A STRUCK MATCH gets him to wheel and just then we see
Hannibal lighting up a cigar

Face smiles

HANNIBAL
You know what they say Face
FACE
What’s that Hannibal
HANNIBAL
A Limey officer and his pounds are soon

parted
He slaps half the money into Face’s awaiting palm

FACE

HANNIBAL

ee Crs FO

WHAMMM The British officer they grifted steps out of
nowhere to deck him with a right cross sending his cigar
flying One of his sidekicks is right there with him

BRITISH OFFICER
(raging)
You dirty cheating American bastards

Face doesn’t wait for more he dives at the second British
officer a snarl on his mug

as Hannibal whips his leg around and knocks the first
officer to the ground he straddles the guy and WHAM
WHAM pounds him in the face

just then a LIEUTENANT sprints up pointing at a
television that is visible through a canopy

LIEUTENANT
It’s starting It’s starting

He points at the TV and CNN is showing images of Baghdad
being pounded by missiles

Face and Hannibal look up at the TV from where they are
both straddling the two brits fists cocked Someone turns
up the volume on the television
CNN REPORTER
They are calling it “Shock and Awe” as
Baghdad is being bombarded

HANNIBAL
I like that Shock and

WHAM He pounds the British officer one more time in the
face

BRITISH OFFICER
(groans)
Awwwww

And we FREEZE FRAME on the guy’s face as it gets knocked
sideways

and the words THE A-TEAM splash on to the screen
Just as quickly the movie resumes and we

GEN GARNER
Get used to it This is a diplomatic
mission ‘Operation Friends of Liberty’

HANNIBAL
No offense but I‘d rather go back to
securing oil fields in Basra

GEN GARNER
Then you shouldnt have majored in art
history

Hannibal reacts
HANNIBAL

I took one course to impress a blonde
named Elizabeth Barbour

GEN GARNER
How’d that work out

HANNIBAL
She divorced me six years ago

GEN GARNER
Smart woman I pulled a team of Rangers

Face is nearby He watches BA shudder nervously as the
chopper steadies itself again Then he looks down at
BA‘s hand the man is pumping a tennis ball almost
squeezing the air right out of it Like he’s channeling
his tension into the ball

FACE
Afraid of jumping sarge

BA turns his death stare on to Face

BA
Im not afraid of nothing But until the
good lord grows some wings out of my

HANNIBAL (CONTD)
You will not deploy till you pass through
the enemy radar zone at two thousand feet

Finally BA shakes his head defeated

BA
I can’t

HANNIBAL
Alright sergeant you stay behind

BA relaxes stops squeezing that ball while Hannibal
UNCLIPS Turns away

Hannibal suddenly wraps his arms in a vice grip around BA
and LEAPS FROM THE HOLD carrying BA OUT
INTO BA’S POV - A ‘HALO’ FREE FALL

Dropping from the height of Mt Everest Resisting the
urge to open a chute They simply FALL

And FALL And FALL The GROUND rushing UP too fast for

BA growls as Hannibal hands him an M-16 and spots a beat-
up CONTAINER (the trailer half of an 18 WHEELER) with
Arabic graffiti being loaded with ARTIFACTS by MUSEUM
STAFF The CAB sits with some other rusty old RIGS

Hannibals Rangers take positions around the museum Al-
Mahdi looks openly disappointed

DR AL-MAHDI
Is this all of you

HANNIBAL
This is enough

DR AL-MAHDI
We cannot fit everything into one

container

HANNIBAL
Then youll have to take what’s most
valuable

DR AL-MAHDI
(stares then)
That would be everything

warrior

HANNIBAL
Uh-huh

PIKE

Hannibal turns away to move inside the museum

HANNIBAL
Civilians

He walks

INSIDE THE MAIN GALLERY

»-and over to where Al Mahdi is gingerly lifting the case
surrounding an exquisite VASE sparkling like a star

DR AL-MAHDI
I’m afraid to move it Afraid not to
It’s more than five thousand years old

- HANNIBAL
It’s from Ur the Babylonian city

DR AL-MAHDI
You know art history colonel

HANNIBAL
I took a class

DR AL-MAHDI
Cast by Nebuchadnezzar for the Hanging
Gardens of Babylon Taken from Darius by
Alexander the Great The boy-king’s
ashes were hidden inside The Prophet
himself said one day the tears of the
wretched would fill the golden vase and
peace would settle on the land

HANNIBAL
Thats a big story for a small vase

Al-Mahdi smiles

DR AL-MAHDI
We Iraqi’s love stories

HANNIBAL
I‘1ll put it on myself

DR AL-MAHDI
This is only a display copy

He points to a small tin SEAL at the bottom
DR AL-MAHDI (CONT’D)

DR AL-MAHDI

HANNIBAL
Yeah Listen professor either you come
with us or my man here
(nods at Face)
---is going to have to stay with you and
possibly get disfigured by a mortar
explosion

FACE
Would you want to be responsible for
disfiguring this face

The curator doesn’t know how to respond

HANNIBAL
I didn’t think so

He grabs Al-Mahdi under the elbow and leads him to the
CHINOOK

Pike is just about to close the door

HANNIBAL (CONT’D)
We got one more

PIKE
Sorry we’re full up

HANNIBAL
Then youll have to ride it out on the
ground like the rest

PIKE

Have a nice life Colonel

Pike turns to call out

PIKE (CONT’D)
Take her up Andy

but Hannibal yanks him by the ankles where he falls
right out of the chopper with a THUD

Another MORTAR ROUND explodes nearby and the GREEN LAKE
CHOPPER takes off without them

PIKE (CONTD)
Are you out of your fucking mind How am
I gonna get out now

HANNIBAL

He starts to move around to the drivers side but BA is
standing there

BA

HANNIBAL
You know how to handle a wheel

BA
If she’s got an engine and can’t defy
gravity I can handle her

HANNIBAL
All right then

He slides in next to Face as BA takes the wheel

MOVING WITH THE 18 WHEELER (60 MPH)

BA catches up with Pike’s CAB Nose to bumper Pushing
the massive RIG onto a NARROW STREET Bad combination

BA blasts through anything in the way Small CARS

SLOW DISSOLVE

IN THE CAB Hannibal Face and BA fried Coated in

A bevy of Army vehicles and tanks have taken over the road
Troops swarm over to the truck as our trio climb down
Some of the troops snap salutes to the tired men

Soon a MEDICAL EVAC CHOPPER touches down GENERAL GARNER
leaps out and hurries to our guys

GEN GARNER

Colonel Smith you were ordered to

those orders and stayed behind
‘Operation Friends of Liberty’ was your
chance for larceny You planned it all

HANNIBAL
As a soldier you learn the same lesson
over and over Nothing ever comes
together the way you plan it

The Judge Advocate walks back Stops Turns
JUDGE ADVOCATE

One last question Isn’t it true you
majored in art history

Hannibal just stares at the guy his face going hot

LATER BA sits on the stand

JUDGE ADVOCATE (CONT’D)

leniency to testify against Colonel
Smith He refused

Now I offer it one last time Tell us
what Colonel Smith did with the
artifacts and you can avoid prison

BA locks eyes with the Advocate

BA
You want me to lie to save my ass
That’s old army sir I’m new army

shamed

truth

Face nods like he’s troubled but then he sets his jaw
like he’s going to do what’s right He locks eyes with
Hannibal

FACE
I can’t lie for you anymore Colonel

Hannibal stands up

HANNIBAL

The JUDGE is banging the gavel trying to get control of
these proceedings

CHIEF JUDGE
That’s enough

FACE
(still to Hannibal)
Just tell ‘em where you buried the art
Hannibal sits down stunned realizing he’s been played

JUDGE ADVOCATE
No further questions

Face stands up and starts to be led away close to the
table holding the defendants

Suddenly Hannibal launches for Face even cuffed

BA does the same fighting through the MPs who are trying
to restrain him

Tt’s a melee in the cozy confines of the courtroom as
Hannibal knocks Face to the ground

FACE
Get ‘em off me

Finally the MPs get Hannibal and BA restrained Face
gets up breathing hard

We don’t think there’s going to be any more said but

FACE (CONTD)
I told ‘em what I know Colonel

That’s it Hannibal launches again but this time the MPs
pull them in opposite directions

As they’re being pushed toward doorways on either end of
the corridor Hannibal kicking the whole way BA

turns and gives Face one last death stare Lynch watches
the whole time making notes

INT MILITARY TRIBUNAL - LATER

BANG gavel down CAPTAIN LYNCH is suddenly standing right
in front of Hannibal

HANNIBAL
We were railroaded And woulda been
found guilty even without Peck’s
testimony

LYNCH
You were given a fair trial

He reaches out Takes OFF Hannibal’s SPECIAL FORCES PIN
An insult and a humiliation

HANNIBAL
I‘1l be coming for that

HANNIBAL

LYNCH

squeamish at the thought of priceless
artifacts buried somewhere in the Iraqi
desert stolen for personal profit by a
traitor to his uniform Maybe I get a
little piqued at every news channel and
paper’ back home calling the army I love
and respect and have dedicated my life to
a bunch of incompetent amoral idiots for
allowing the Iraqi National Museum to get
looted Or maybe I just don’t like you

HANNIBAL

BA

Then let me tell you something Face-man
There are nine commandments in the Bible
that I try to live by “Thou shalt not
steal” is something Mrs Baracas taught
me when I was a pup and I’ve never broken
it

Murdock pipes up

MURDOCK
Aren’t there ten commandments

BA
I tend to look past the one about not
killing Especially when we’re talking
about rats

He and Face are still eye to eye Hannibal finishes tying
his tie
HANNIBAL
Enough They’ll be plenty of time to
kill each other later Right now let’s
save it for the Russians

leans out the WINDOW

HANNIBAL (CONT’D)
Try to lose him in those hills

INTO VIEW PIKE piloting a BLACKHAWK overshoots the
truck and turns back

BA
My cousin D‘Andre used to turn the lights
out and drive Route 2 in the hills over
Eagle Rock Freaked us all out

HANNIBAL
Bet he didn’t have a Blackhawk on his
tail

BA

Worse LAPD

ON THE BLACKHAWK PIKE comes round Sprays rounds in
FRONT OF ARIG just close enough to make BA turn

HANNIBAL
He won’t hit us Not with a billion
dollars worth of art in the back

BA
He’s herding us

IN THE TRAILER Dr Al-Mahdi is tossed around like a rag
doll He grabs a precious BOWL as it starts to fall
Tries to hold as many things as he can

The BLACKHAWK strafes around the rig pushing towards a
BLIND CANYON IN THE MOUNTAINS

The RIG follows along a sandy bottom It winds for a
quarter mile Now BA leans forward

BA (CONTD)
There’s no way out colonel
(no response)
Hannibal

But Hannibal is not in the truck anymore

TILT UP Pike’s CHOPPER zooms over them Fires two ROCKETS
in succession The rockets slam into the CLIFF ROCKS
fall blocking any retreat

The rig is now literally stuck between a rock and a hard
place

BA has no choice but to slam on the brakes The trailer
starts to jack-knife Finally skids to a STOP

TO PIKE hovering in the narrow canyon between two high
CLIFFS RIG directly BELOW

PIKE
(into two-way)
He’s stuck Send out a crew to tow the
rig back

ON THE CLIFF HANNIBAL leaps from solid rock THROUGH the
AIR ONTO the BLACKHAWK CLINGS to the HOLD DOOR

PIKE feels the impact Looks LEFT Nothing RIGHT the
HOLD DOOR is OPEN He reaches for his 9mm and spins just
as HANNIBAL lands a punch

PIKE yanks the STICK back sending the BLACKHAWK both UP
and banking RIGHT

HANNIBAL is thrown towards the OPEN PASSENGER DOOR Braces
his arm Pike fires shatters the WINDOW Lands a rabbit
punch to Hannibal’s back Hannibal shoots his elbow
catching Pike’s cheek and grabs for the stick but it’s
too late

The BLACKHAWK clips a ROCK its blades sliced away With a
lurch the helicopter flips to its side CRASHES

INSIDE HANNIBAL and PIKE neither is moving LONG BEAT
Finally PIKE bolts up to see a growing FIRE Disoriented
he Pulls himself OUT

EXT BLACKHAWK - ON THE ROCK OUTCROP (CONTINUOUS)

PIKE emerges from the burning chopper Sees HEADLIGHTS
moving his way Reaches for a side arm with his bloody
hand Turns FINDS HANNIBAL already charging Hannibal
knocks his handand the gun skips OVER the edge

ON HANNIBAL and PIKE each grips the other’s gun belt
Landing blows Eye to eye Pike’s enormous upper body
strength starts to overwhelm Hannibal

The next blow propels Hannibal back OFF the rock Drops
eight feet hits hard A FLAT LEDGE No time to recover
Pike is on him

CLOSER Pike uses a rock Slams it to Hannibals temple
Hannibal is losing consciousness Pike suddenly stops

EVEN CLOSER A trickle of BLOOD from Pikes mouth PAN”
DOWN Hannibal has jammed his SPECIAL FORCES PIN deep
into Pike’s neck Pike goes slack dead

WIDE SHOT - CANYON - THREE GRIZZLIES

MURDOCK behind SOSA At the SCOPE of the 120 mm

Objects in the scope may appear closer
than they are

Sosa squints through the scope slips her finger on the RED
GUN TRIGGER

SOSA
Then I’11 aim low
She FIRES the 120 mm BOOM The GRIZZLY is in FLAMES

SOSA aims again BOOM ‘The second APC goes up in
flames

But the third APC rips around the wreckage and makes a
beeline for where BA is standing with the professor in
front of the truck
“105

IN THE FINAL APC
The passenger barks at the driver

APC PASSENGER
Run ‘em down

The driver grits his teeth mashes the accelerator

IN FRONT OF THE TRUCK

BA has nowhere to go he grits his teeth the APC
baring down on him he’s a goner

ewhen all of a sudden another GRIZZLY comes flying out
of nowhere and

INSIDE THE GRIZZLY we see Face at the wheel

It barrels into the side of the other APC SMASH Knocking
it over so it rolls like a spare tire and smashes into the
canyon’s walls

BA looks up at Face grateful Face just winks from
behind the wheel He wipes the sweat off his brow with the
back of his hand and the CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIS WRIST

which is bloody like something’s been cut out of it

United States Army we’re still criminals

country didn’t care about anything
anymore except getting rich And why
not Whoever said money can’t buy
happiness was dead broke
