a chart showing air quality going down and sales going up

even more and drive sales where
Through the roof

O’Hare nods his approval

OHARE

INT WALL - PRESENT - NIGHT

Ted looks in though the door in the wall revealing a large
dark room He rides through the maze-like room on his
scooter passing a stream of gluppity-glup pouring out from a
series of pipes

TED
Whoa

A security camera watches him drive by He continues over
the stream on a small bridge until he reaches an exit

EXT OUTSIDE OF TOWN - PRESENT - CONTINUOUS

Ted comes out into the world outside of town It’s a
desolate landscape Filled with garbage and filthy water and
tree stumps

TED
Huh

He’s seeing his world as it really is And it’s a nightmare

Ted steels himself and continues on past the graveyard of
tree stumps

A storm brews in the smoggy sky and he looks up to see an old
Thneed billboard Lightning FLASHES distracting Ted who is
almost beheaded by a series of old rusted axe blades He
dodges and weaves through them He looks behind him to
reveal it’s a destroyed Axe Hacker Lightning FLASHES in the
sky again

TED (CONTD)
Oh man

Ted stops at a large ravine where a bridge is out He looks
around to see if there is another way to cross and spots some
old barrels and a plank of wood He gets an idea

EXT RAVINE - PRESENT - LATER

Ted revs his scooter and then takes off toward the ravine
where he has setup the barrel and the plank of wood as a
makeshift ramp He intends to jump it but as he reaches the
end of the ramp he plummets down the side

He SCREAMS but picks up so much speed that he drives right
back up the other side He flies into the air and bounces
back down He breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF and continues on his
journey up the side of a mountain pass

EXT DESOLATION - PRESENT - CONTINUOUS

The city is far behind him now Ted scooters through the
fog past warning signs reading “Stay out” and “I mean it”
and down the worn path where he comes to a stop in front of a
hand-painted street sign covered in CROWS He gets off his
scooter and as he approaches it the crows take off
revealing that it reads “The Street of the Lifted Lorax”

He keeps moving forward through the fog until he comes to a
rickety old shack with a boarded-up window that looks like a
strong wind might knock it over (otherwise known as The
Lerkim) Ted stares at the spooky image frozen Then takes
a deep breath and continues up the hill

TED
Whoa All right

He arrives in front of the Lerkim which only looks creepier
up close He continues forward not noticing that someone
is watching him from inside the boarded up window

Ted walks past a small ring of stones The word “Unless” is
carved into one of them

Ted removes the money nail and snail from his pocket The
snail shakes his head giving Ted a look like “Let’s get out
of here”

Ted ignores the snail and heads up the steps leading to the
front door The wind whistles and the old wood CREAKS
beneath his feet He gets more nervous with each step The
railing falls over scaring him Then he arrives at the door
with a sign above it reading “THE ONCE-LER” Ted stares at
it then takes a deep breath and moves his shaking finger
toward the doorbell He presses it then--

WHIRRRRRRRRCLANK Immediately a crazy Seussian machine is
activated

TED (CONTD)
Okay

It catapults him into the air

TED (CONTD)
What the--

A clamp catches by the seat of his pants just before he hits
the ground and hoists him back up into the air

TED (CONTD)

window Ted still hanging upside-down stares at them
horrified

his hand

his face with Truffula fruit PIPSQUEAK a baby Bar-Ba-Loot
sits next to him eating his own piece of fruit Then a
series of Bar-Ba-Loots jump onto Lou’s head and stand on one
another’s shoulders to get to some fruit high in the tree
Pipsqueak is passed up the chair of Bar-Ba-Loots and he grabs
the fruit for the group

revealing a nest with BILL a baby Swomee-Swan in it Bill
YAWNS and HONKS at camera

We follow the Swomee-Swan as it flies through the forest
past a stream and to a clear blue pond where--

The Trio of Humming-Fish climb out of the water onto a rock
and HUM like an a cappella group Then they slide back down
into the water and their HUMMING becomes GURGLING

Melvin pulls the wagon down into the valley where all of the
curious animals gather around them The Once-ler hops down
from the wagon with his guitar and starts begins rocking out

Two Bar-Ba-Loots look at each other confused

investigate

THWACK As he stands up he accidentally smacks a Bar-ba-loot
with his guitar

Then he tosses it up into the air and runs off screen One
Bar-Ba-Loot pushes another out of the way as the guitar falls
back down to the ground and nearly clobbers him

The Once-ler sings and dances through the valley followed by
the curious animals

Once-ler as he walks over to the tall Truffula tree

He raises the axe up over his head The animals watch
curiously

CHOP The axe cuts into the tree with a sound that echoes
through the valley

The tree creaks and moans as it falls and hits the ground
with a THUD

The animals react in horror What did he just do

The Once-ler stares at the tree impressed

The animals investigate the stump A Humming-Fish pokes at
it

Suddenly the ground starts rumbling The animals scatter
There’s a LOUD NOISE and a FLASH OF LIGHT as a thunderstorm
shoots out of the stump The animals watch from a safe
distance

The one fish slaps the other fish for poking the stump

The Swomee-Swans shove their head in the ground like
ostriches A Bar-Ba-Loot tries it and knocks himself out

A series of lightning bolts hit the stump causing an
explosion that reverberates through the valley

Lou struggles to stand up in the wind A fish flies into his
face knocking him over

The whole thunderstorm is sucked back into the stump and out
Ppops-—

THE LORAX Shortish brownish and in charge He slowly
stands up Sees the stump reacts horrified

LORAX
(in disbelief)
What the w-- Who the-- Oh

The animals watch as he collects some ROCKS and stacks them
on the stump creating a memorial Pipsqueak sees this He
brings over a rock and offers it to the Lorax Other animals
join him

When they are done they take a moment of silence for the
stump Pipsqueak walks over and holds the Lorax’s hand Lou
awkwardly grabs the Lorax’s other hand and starts blubbering

Then the Lorax hears the Once-ler WHISTLING and spots him
ripping tufts from the Truffula tree The Lorax furrows his
brow and walks over to investigate

The Once-ler shakes the tufts like pom-poms as he pulls them
off the felled tree

Then he pulls another piece of the tuft and the Lorax comes
up with it

ropes Kick out a STAKE The canvas starts to sag

would have been The Lorax holds up his hand to stop the

The Once-ler turns and sees the approaching rapids

ONCE-LER
Aaah We’re in a river

The river is picking up speed Pipsqueak and the Once-ler
hold on for dear life as the bed hits the whitewater and bobs
up and down

ONCE-LER AND PIPSQUEAK
Whhhhhhoooooooaaaaa
Dr Seuss The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 46

Finally the whitewater ends The Once-ler and Pipsqueak
breathe sighs of relief They LAUGH at the fact that they
survived and then see the waterfall ahead of them

PIPSQUEAK
Ewww

ONCE-LER
Oh no

He and Pipsqueak SCREAM in fear The Once-ler unsuccessfully
tries to use his pillow to paddle away from the waterfall
He calls to the Lorax

ONCE-LER (CONTD)
Just do something

The Lorax looks around Spots a GIANT BOULDER up high above
the waterfall

LORAX
Help is on the way

The bed heads closer and closer to the falls
ONCE-LER
(mutters to himself)

What the-- Oh no

The Lorax quickly scampers up to the boulder with a STICK
Wedges the stick under the boulder Tries to dislodge it

LORAX
Just a minute

He jumps up and down on the stick The boulder gets
dislodged and rolls down the hill

At the end of the hill is a small slope going up which send
the boulder flying

The Once-ler and Pipsqueak about to go over the waterfall
now see a giant boulder flying at them

ONCE-LER AND PIPSQUEAK
Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh

THUMP The boulder connects with the far side of the bed
catapulting the Once-ler and Pipsqueak off of it

The bed crashes over the falls Violently

THUD The Once-ler bounces and slides along the ground on
his back holding Pipsqueak up in the air so he wouldn’t get
hurt

PIPSQUEAK
Huh

Pipsqueak looks over to the Lorax who appears on the scene
seeing the Once-ler lying unconscious His eyes go wide

LORAX
Oooo Oh no
(slaps the Once-ler)
Wake up Wake up

The Lorax knows what he needs to do but doesn’t want to do
it

The animals watch as the Lorax pinches the Once-ler’s nose
and tips his head back He takes a deep breath and lowers
his lips to the Once-ler’s

The Lorax comes up and wipes off his tongue That didn’t
work so he grabs two Bar-Ba-Loots rubbing them together to
create a static charge that he uses to shock the Once-ler

LORAX (CONT’D)
Clear

The Lorax jumps back as the Once-ler wakes up He
immediately reaches out and hugs the Lorax

ONCE-LER
Haha I was heading into the light
and you pulled me right back and
here I am You saved my life

The Lorax squirms guiltily as the Once-ler hugs him

LORAX
Yeah noI know Well no it’s
not that big a deal

ONCE-LER
It is a big deal Look I almost
went over that waterfall--
(breaks off hug
realizing)
In my bed How did my bed get in

The Once-ler drops the Lorax

LORAX (CONTD)
I didn’t mean you any harm I just
wanted to calmly float you away
(beat)
Look everyone here needs the
trees And you’re chopping ‘em
down So we’ve got a big problem

The Once-ler looks down and sees Pipsqueak holding on to his
leg looking up at him with puppy-dog eyes Pipsqueak nods
The Once-ler looks at all the animals The Lorax Finally
it begins to sink in He kneels down and address the
animals

ONCE-LER
(holds up his hand to
swear)
Alright look I hereby swear that
I will never chop down another
tree I promise

The Lorax looks him over

LORAX
Thank you But I’m gonna keep my
eye on you

ONCE-LER
Good Now I’ve got a big day
tomorrow so I’m going to get some
sleep

The Once-ler heads off toward his house The animals all
CHEER The Once-ler stops and walks back toward the falls

bodys way of telling other people

The Once-ler jumps up out of his bed flustered

ONCE-LER

Then he turns to the counter and sees several fish sitting in
drinking glasses of water like jacuzzis

Once-ler follows him tossing the toothbrush in the trash

ONCE-LER

He reaches under the table and pulls up Lou who is now
wearing the Thneed as underwear

ONCE-LER (CONTD)

adup-apoh

The Once-ler uses it to wipe up the mud tracks

ONCE-LER (CONTD)
But wait there’s more Thanks to
its all-natural micro-fibers the
Thneed is super-absorbent

Then he goes to the fish swimming a glass filled with water
Shoves the Thneed into the glass SLUUUURP It instantly
soaks up all the water leaving the irritated fish standing
in the dry glass

ONCE-LER (CONTD)
It also works as a hat

He plops the Thneed onto Lorax’s head SPLURCH It’s
sopping wet and drips all over him The Lorax gives the Once-

with them It’s an awesome sight as they all roll and bounce
down the hill The bottles smack O’Hare in the face and the
one with the seed bounces by before he can grab it

OHARE (CONTD)
Hey ow-ow-ow Oh C’mon

McGurk turns the scooter around and goes after it

Just then Ted’s scooter approaches at the bottom of the
hill

O’Hare catches up to the bottle with the seed and grabs it
LAUGHING in victory But his hand gets stuck and he can’t
reach the seed

OHARE (CONTD)
What the--

He holds out his arm to Mooney in the other truck

OHARE (CONTD)
Get it unstuck Get it unstuck

Ted drives toward him playing chicken
OHARE (CONTD)
Bring it on Teddy You don’t have
the guts
Grammy SCREAMS

AUDREY
Ted

At the last second Ted leans the scooter over and skids
underneath O’Hare and the bottle It goes into slo-mo

TED
(in slo-mo)
Grammy

Grammy hooks the bottle with her cane and yanks it away from
O’Hare

Ted rights the bike and the scene goes back to normal speed

TED and AUDREY and GRAMMY

the center of town by the STATUE OF O’HARE Ted Audrey and
Grammy Norma quickly get off the scooter Grammy Norma hits
her cane against the ground but it’s paved over

TED

pulling levers The bulldozer growls like a dinosaur and
immediately begins spinning out of control VRRRRUUUUMBL

GRAMMY NORMA

and severs the head off the O’HARE STATUE The head falls to
the ground cracking open the pavement and revealing--

A PATCH OF DIRT

politician

OHARE

sap all over the place

stinging bees

cane)
So I say let it grow

The whole crowd now joins in on the chorus O’Hare can see

Now O’Hare steps out of the middle of the crowd onto the top
of his severed statue’s head

OHARE
My names OHare Im one of you

EXT LERKIM - PRESENT - SAME

The Once-ler’s eyes appear in the boarded up window He
looks toward Thneedville trying to make out the faint music
he hears in the distance

TOWNSPEOPLE (0S)
It is just one tiny seed
But its all we really need

The Once-ler turns his ear to the window but it’s still too
faint He disappears back inside his Lerkim
Dr Seuss The Lorax 1-6-12 Final Locked Reels Conform 101

INT LERKIM - PRESENT - SAME

It’s hard to make out anything in the dark and shadowy room
Then the Once-ler’s gloved hands appear grabbing the handle
of a RUSTY OLD AXE next to the Great-Great-Great Grandfather
snail on his desk We can barely make out the silhouette of
the Once-ler raising the axe over his head then

TOWNSPEOPLE (0S)
Its time to banish all your greed

WHACK He chops away at the boards covering his window
WHACK CRACK The axe breaks through the boards and
sunlight shines into the room for the first time in years

TOWNSPEOPLE (0S) (CONT’D)
Imagine Thneedville flowered and
treed

Then the Once-ler steps into the light and moves toward the
window We see his face for the first time Old and
wrinkled with an enormous Lorax-like moustache The Old
Once-ler leans out of the window and listens Far off in the
distance he hears voices singing

TOWNSPEOPLE (0S) (CONT’D)
Let this be our solemn creed

The Once-ler’s sad old eyes slowly widen as he realizes what
he’s hearing Tears begin to well up as he looks down at the
“Unless” stones below him then back toward Thneedville A
proud smile creeps across his face

ONCE-LER
Thank you Ted

EXT TOWN SQUARE - PRESENT - SAME

The crowd of people watch as Ted and Audrey prepare to plant
the little seed into the ground Rocks surround the hole in
a protective circle (an echo of what the Lorax and animals
did earlier)

EVERYONE
We say let it grow
(in Thneedville)

Audrey leans in and surprises Ted with a kiss on the cheek
His eyes go wide

EVERYONE (CONTD)
We say let it grow
(its a brand new dawn)

Grammy Norma walks over with a watering can as Ted plants the
seed She waters it and the tree begins to grow towards
camera in time-lapse

EXT LERKIM - PRESENT - DAY

Cross dissolve from the sapling in Town Square to one growing
in the desolate wasteland outside of the Lerkim

The Old Once-ler steps outside with a watering can in hand
He makes his way over to the UNLESS stones where some small
patches of grass are beginning to grow around the tiny
Truffula tree

The Once-ler carefully sprinkles water on a few saplings and
smiles Then he hears a faint sound off in the distance
The same sound he heard when the Lorax disappeared into the
sky years ago

He looks up and sees the smoggy clouds beginning to part A

ray of sunshine falls upon him and a SWOMEE-SWAN swoops down

from above The amazed Once-ler watches the bird fly by then
turns to the UNLESS stones where he sees--

The Lorax Floating back down to the stones Smiling The
Once-ler can’t contain himself and LAUGHS IN JOY

LORAX
You done good beanpole You done
good

The Old Once-ler kneels down and gives him a hug

LORAX (CONT’D)
By the way nice mustache
