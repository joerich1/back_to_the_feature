OPEN letting in a chilly breeze

Brooke walks to the balcony door shutting it She looks
outside Dark Still Quiet Brooke closes the curtain The
song picks up a faster beat as Brooke moves to

bends down to get it The split second she does--

PHFT-PHFT-PHFT-PHFT-PHFT-PHFT -- RAPID BULLETS of

still PLAYING throughout the apartment

the metal door completely OFF Wasting no time Brooke WEDGES

He removes a SMALL SCANNER bringing it up to her bleeding
hand The scanner gets a read-out

BEEP The Operative understands the results He takes out a
CHEMICAL PISTOL aiming it right at Brooke’s heart and

A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT Out of no where -- echoing through the
parking lot Operative 2 SHOOTS a stray DART in Brooke’s
shoulder pauses and drops to the ground DEAD

Before Brooke can even react a SECOND SHOT BLASTS

impact sends the car SPINNING around and--

Nash in one of the larger offices sticks the toothpick in
his mouth

Nash watches a VIDEO MONITOR showing SECURITY FOOTAGE of a
seaport being attacked by ELEVEN ARMED MEN in operational
gear It’s more massacre than raid

The screen turns to STATIC Vivian turns off the monitor

VIVIAN
The strike lasted around fifteen
minutes The count was eight dead
two still in critical condition

Nash looks over on-site PHOTOGRAPHS The aftermath of the
port attack we just saw

NASH

(raising a photo)
That is one good looking picture
Accidental backlighting Contrast
Could frame the damn thing if it
wasn’t for the dead people

(pointing at something in

the photo)
This here’s the only container they
were after

WE SEE THE PICTURE A wider shot of LINED SHIPPING
CONTAINERS One container’s OPEN and EMPTY
VIVIAN
Yes By the time backup arrived it
was empty The code-in for the
container was NSA As the NSA
director we need to know what was
inside

NASH
What they stole is irrelevant once
they’re captured or killed

VIVIAN
It’1ll give us a better chance of
finding them

Nash stands defiant Then

NASH
I understand you apprehended one of
them after the initial attack

VIVIAN
One operative was injured during
the fire-fight He was taken in for
interrogation

NASH
Yeah and you damn-well killed him

VIVIAN
With all due respect sir you were
given the Guantanamo transfer order
an hour before we started There’s
a reason you didn’t sign it

Nash turns to Vivian He’s in full control

NASH
And the names he gave you Did they
warrant

VIVIAN
Three are already dead The fourth
-- a girl in Illinois -- is being

taken in as we speak These are
private sector civilians There
must be some connection

NASH
What’s the girl’s name

INT VETERINARIANS MEDICAL OFFICE THIRD FLOOR - NIGHT

A dark cluttered mess of hallways containing STACKED DOG
CAGES and OFFICES A holding floor for animal procedures A
few DOGS barking in the BG

We find Brooke on a steel operations table unconscious Her
body illuminated by a small LAMP A HAND guides a prepped
syringe to Brooke’s forearm Needle connects with skin and--

Brooke JOLTS awake scrambling off the table Silas stands
back trying to keep the mania down

SILAS
It’s okay Look
(re the syringe)
It’s just for infections

Brooke keeps her distance Confused Disoriented

BROOKE
Where am I Who the hell are

SILAS

My name is Silas Derose I’m an
agent with the CIA

BROOKE
(nervous laughter)
Right
(looking around)
Where am I

SILAS
Hogkins Veterinary Medical
Hospital three miles outside of
Belleville You had injuries that
required some attention

Brooke circles Silas trying to piece it all together
SILAS (CONTD)
I’m not here to hurt you okay I
need you to trust me

Brooke steps closer to Silas weary but calm

BROOKE
Let me see some identification

Silas pauses Finally he reaches in his inner-coat pocket
revealing a 9MM PISTOL holstered on his hip In that instant--

Brooke snatches the table lamp -- SMASHING it on Silas’
temple He recoils Brooke removes his pistol -- standing
back -- aiming it right at him--

SILAS

God dammit That hurt

BROOKE
I don’t know what’s going on but I
do know the definition of
kidnapping -- so step back

SILAS
(re the gun)
You don’t know how to use that

FOCUS ON Brooke’s ring finger DISARMING the safety on the
gun like a seasoned pro and--

Brooke FIRES A single shot right by Silas’ feet Brooke
looks at the gun How did she know that Why does it feel so
natural in her hands

Brooke levels the gun back at Silas

BROOKE
The the next one goes in your
kneecap Get back

SILAS
You should know a CIA agent isn’t
rattled by the barrel of a gun

BROOKE
Yeah A bullet in the head might
faze you

SILAS

You could’ve experienced that for
yourself tonight if I hadn’t
stepped in

BROOKE
And why did you

SILAS
Because I’ve been watching you

Brooke pauses

SILAS (CONTD)
Last night my department received
credible intelligence linking you
to a national security breach

BROOKE
Bullshit

SILAS
You were targeted by name Brooke
Three other civilians are already
dead You’re next You’re the last

Brooke backs up between a line of dog CAGES down the hall
Silas follows

BROOKE
This is ridiculous I’m

SILAS

How you managed to escape tonight
was a matter of blind luck and my
intervention So put the gun down
and listen to me because you need
to know what’s going on

BROOKE

getting out of here

Brooke raises her right hand revealing the still fresh wound
of the switchblade cut

BROOKE (CONTD)

took some kind of blood sample
After that one of them switched to

You killed him didn’t you

INT THIRD FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

THREE OPERATIVES burst through the third floor stairwell
entrance guns raised They slow down because

The entire third floor is COVERED in a matrix of multi-
positioned lighting sources and shadows A fun-house of
illumination and silhouettes The Operatives spread out

ON PHANTOM OPERATIVE
Who covers the eastern end He moves slowly through the hall

stealth-like A SHADOW CROSSES from behind The Operative
turns to see--

Silas -- in one solid motion -- the heel of his hand catching
the Operatives throat -- a series of lightening fast punches
-- one-two-three -- the Operative fires a SINGLE SHOT before
he hits the floor

Silas takes the downed Operative’s AK-47

The TWO other Operatives reach the eastern end finding their
fallen comrade The LEAD OPERATIVE falls back to the SOUTHERN
end of the room

The other paces down the hall cautious WE MOVE LOWER to

PING An SHOT just MISSES him The Operative flips over the
nearby STEEL TABLE using it as cover MEDICAL SUPPLIES fall
to the floor

Silas is by the hallway cages scrambling for a second shot
The Operative UNLOADS a barrage of bullets at Silas

A BULLET strikes Silas’ shoulder sending him backward The
Operative rises moving in So fucking fast

And just as fast is--

BROOKE -- right there beside him -- already knocking the
Operative’s Ak-47 clean out of his hands and--

Brooke grabs a small SCALPEL from the floor and starts
HACKING AWAY through the air until--

The Operative TACKLES Brooke to the floor Brooke knees him
in the groin getting back up She grabs--

A small circular BONE SAW on the counter Brooke clutches the
bone saw’s eight foot CORD and SWINGS the saw like a whip at
her attacker

It’s improvised Messy But manic The Operative ducks and
pivots until--

Brooke SWINGS the saw AROUND THE OPERATIVE’S NECK creating a
makeshift NOOSE with the blade PRESSING against his jugular

Brooke YANKS the cord sending The Operative to his knees He
reaches for his nearby gun

Brooke takes the end of the cord turns and PLUGS THE BONE
SAW IN AN OUTLET The BLADE SPINS instantly digging inside
the Operative’s NECK He’s dead in seconds

Brooke catches her breath unplugging the bone saw She
stands there shaking Trying to comprehend what she’s just
done Her thoughts interrupted by

A DEVICE on the lead Operative’s hip The same SCANNER used
on her earlier Brooke takes it examining the strange
object

SILAS (0S)
Damn

Brooke pockets the scanner racing toward Silas

BROOKE
Are you alright

SILAS
It’s okay it just grazed me

Silas looks over at the Operative dead and leaking blood

still alive is unable to handle a
threat of this magnitude

really is

I do And I’m taking over this
investigation

Vivian breezes by Nash -- like hell you are

VIVIAN
Under who’s authority

With all do respect the NSA has
authority over your department--

Vivian steps closer snatching the file out of Nash’s hands

VIVIAN
You’re not telling me half of what
you know

NASH

I’m quite generous aren’t I

VIVIAN
Who is Alexis Brewer What was
stolen from the port How is this
all connected Let me help you
(beat)
I deserve to know what’s going on

Nash holds Finally

NASH
Alexis Brewer worked for the CIA
long before you were here She was
dangerous To us to the country
She no longer exists

(then)
What was stolen from the port was
technology that could bring her
back That’s what these operatives
want Alexis to return And if that
happens you and I will be in such
deep shit we’ll be looking for

Brooke recognizes the loss in Silas’ eyes She moves into the
front looking at the panels determined

BROOKE
We’re overheated and descending
fast There’s not much time

Brooke crawls to the back seats looking through some storage
pockets in the walls She pulls out a MILITARY ISSUE ROPE

Brooke TIES one end to the frame of the helicopter She OPENS

Still hundreds of feet above the river

The fire travels lower -- lower -- time running out Brooke
looks down less than two-hundred feet from the surface

BROOKE (CONTD)

Brooke and Silas LET GO of the rope and--

SLAM into the river surface -- hard They both SKID twenty
feet like skipping stones as the helicopter SMASHES into the

SINKING

would be tough calls What happened
in that room was an easy call We
could have brought them in

security threat and I acted
accordingly

VIVIAN
How was she a national security
threat You can hide behind the
Patriot Act and call Silas Derose
“collateral damage” but we both
know what you did in there

NASH
I saved lives

VIVIAN

You continued an operation based on
vanity Brooke wasn’t a threat to
national security she was a threat
to you Why

You tell me or my last act as SI

That voice I’d recognize it

anywhere

The Butler opens the door completely YARON LOGAN (70s) a
withered pale man dressed to nines walks down a large flight
of stairs to the foyer

SILAS
Yaron how are you

LOGAN

Still here We are all surprised
Last time I heard you were
stationed in Marseille which means
you were actually in Vienna which
means you were actually on holiday

(re Butler)
You can go

(Butler leaves then soft)
He steals from me

Logan catches sight of Brooke

LOGAN (CONTD)
Whenever someone brings a beautiful
woman to my door I assume they’re
an assassin trying to induce a
heart attack

(to Brooke)
And who are you

SILAS
We were hoping you could figure
that out

LOGAN
- Not a friendly visit then

BROOKE
People are trying to kill us

LOGAN
Then you must be doing something
right Come in

INT LOGAN ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

Portraits of past PRESIDENTS on the walls A mausoleum of

LOGAN

I worked for the NSA for forty-four
years brought in before the red
scare Blacklisted in ‘55
reinstated in ‘57 when I gave Joe
McCarthy a case of Brandy which I
like to think inflamed his liver
and killed him

(to Brooke)
You’re not adverse to dark humor
are you

Brooke shakes her head

LOGAN (CONTD)
My two last acts as NSA operational
chief was recommending Silas Derose
to agent field training -- I
believe you were in the navy before
that

SILAS
Navy seals

LOGAN
And promoting Vernon Nash to my job
in 2002

Logan stops turning to Brooke
LOGAN (CONT’D)
Now You know me What do I need to

know about you

Silas hands Logan the scanner with the “Alexis Brewer”
profile Logan studies it suddenly intrigued

LOGAN
Does it bother you

Brooke shakes her head although it’s obvious that it does
Logan moves behind Brooke

Logan stops the music calm Silas watches confused

LOGAN
You worked for the CIA

BROOKE
I never worked for the CIA--

LOGAN
Alexis Brewer worked for the CIA

Brooke pauses something resonating inside her

BROOKE
What are you saying What
happened to me

EXT LANGLEY PARK - SAME
A small park outside the CIA Nash walks with Vivian

NASH
Ten years ago the United States
found itself embroiled in scandals
involving interrogation techniques
The Geneva conventions are a bitch
911 changed things We had to get
creative So the NSA recruited a
team of cerebral scientists to
experiment with methods which could
extract human memory
VIVIAN
What do you mean “extract”

INTERCUT BETWEEN MANSION BASEMENT LANGLEY PARK

Logan addresses Brooke and Silas

LOGAN
All memory functions as chemical
reactions -- the information is

stored With the right stimuli of
neuro patterns that information
could be recreated Imagine being
able to project a human memory --
something you saw or witnessed --
onto a computer screen We would
have no use for unreliable
interrogation methods

BROOKE
So what happened

NASH
Extraction worked but it killed the
subject in the process Too much
stress The brain isn’t equipped
We scrapped the project and moved
on

VIVIAN
Moved on to what

NASH
Something more practical
Deletion

LOGAN
The next level of witness
protection High-level CIA or NSA

members -- those susceptible to
interrogation after retirement or
discharge -- would have their

memories erased replaced and
given new identities It became
practice ten years ago Top secret
of course

SILAS
You just replaced their lives
Why would someone agree to that

BROOKE
(realizing)
-- You forced them
NASH
They wouldn’t remember it What was
the difference

Vivian just stares at Nash incredulous

NASH (CONTD)
“Alexis Brewer” was already dead I
finished the job She was nothing
special In the last decade we
deleted more people than we can
even admit

VIVIAN
- How many How many out there
(then realizing)
My god if the public knew

NASH

An investigation would destroy both
our departments We’re effective
because no one asks how we do it

(off Vivians disgust)
You’re smart Vivian I can make
you CIA head in two years There’s
only one wrong answer in this whole
damn mess and that’s walking away
from it Now get upstairs and
unpack your things We have work to
do

Nash starts walking away Vivian stands there reeling

BROOKE
No this this isn’t possible I
have a life of my own I have a
job I have a boyfriend

LOGAN
Obtaining employment and pursuing
romance hardly defines a life

She looks to Silas pleading This cant be

BROOKE
(desperate)
My-my parents They died in a car
accident--

LOGAN
Were you twenty-two
(off Brooke’s surprise)
You were headed for a hay ride
(MORE )

LOGAN (CONTD)
The brakes on the rental car
failed A nearby farmer found you
in time

BROOKE
(barely a whisper)
How do you know that

LOGAN
Because it’s not true That
particular memory is number 44A --
we called it “Little Girl Lost”
The more traumatic memories were
saved for the higher profile cases
Like you it seems

Brooke’s floored Trying to process everything

BROOKE
Are you saying nothing I remember
about my life really happened

LOGAN
Ever look at your photographs and
not quite remember that day Ever
look at yourself in the mirror and
not quite recognize that girl

staring back Your home -- where
you live -- things seemed off
didn’t they

(beat)

Youre abnormally skilled aren’t
you You can fight with the best of
them Muscle memory hardly fades
-You may find you’re full of

surprises

(then)
However The people after you
know you better Better than
yourself

Brooke’s face starts registering the truth

BROOKE
How How can I stop them

LOGAN
The archives

SILAS
What archives

LOGAN
The only record of who why and
when someone was Deleted The only
record of who you were

BROOKE
How am I supposed to do that Where
are these archives

LOGAN
An underground warehouse located
within the CIA headquarters in
Langley It was a floor designed
for experimental training now used
for storage and security

SILAS
(you’re crazy)
The CIA wants her dead They
activated a contract killer--

BROOKE
They think we’re dead They must

Silas approaches Brooke dumbfounded

SILAS
So what Go to Langley
Somehow get by security somehow
find your way to the archives
and it will end huh

LOGAN
It will begin But that is what you
must do I will show you blueprints
of the facility and share what I
know Beyond that--

BROOKE
Why are you helping us You were a
part of this You son of a bitch--

Brooke lunges forward Silas holds her back

SILAS
Brooke Enough

Brooke settles beyond distraught A million questions A
million emotions

Logan pauses some deep-seeded regret glazed within his eyes

LOGAN
I authorized the program Brooke

Logan reaches in his pocket pulling out a PRESCRIPTION
BOTTLE of medication He sets it on the table

err on the side of compassion or
your illogical time-frame Now one
of these choices forces me to ask
for your name and security number

Brooke notices something 0S Back in action

BROOKE

INT COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER
Brooke enters holding a PURSE

A MAN exiting walks by her Brooke deliberately BUMPS into
him dropping her purse The contents spill on the floor

The Man turns It’s Silas Civilian clothes Still those
sweet eyes

SILAS
Oh I’m so sorry I didn’t see you

Silas kneels down helping Brooke pick up her things

BROOKE
It’s okay Nothing major

Silas and Brooke look at each other A moment Silas tries to
place some recognition

BROOKE (CONTD)
(secretly hopeful)

SILAS
It’s just
(shaking it off)
Nothing Again sorry I need to re-
learn how to walk in public I
guess

BROOKE

Silas turns back to the door Brooke’s clearly disappointed
Then Silas pauses Something holding him there He turns

SILAS
Uh Listen I don’t really do
this but Can I buy your coffee

BROOKE
(relieved blushing)

NUMBER in her phone Brooke then looks 0S and parks her
car We see she’s outside a HOTEL COMPLEX

INT HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Brooke steps in No possessions no attempt at pretending
she has any She steps toward the glass BALCONY DOOR

Brooke looks at the package in her hand NO RETURN ADDRESS
That’s odd She opens it On top of some PACKING MATERIAL is--

A PHOTO Brooke at her college graduation with her PARENTS
The same photo destroyed three months earlier

Brooke stares at it in disbelief She turns it over Written
on the back are the words

“KEEP MOVING -- MOM and DAD”

Brooke looks up at the balcony window Could it be Her real
parents Brooke then notices the REFLECTION FROM BEHIND HER

A MAN -- IT’S FEDIR HE HAS A 9MM PISTOL DRAWN AT HER BACK
FEDIR
You can’t escape what you did

Youll never escape it

Brooke freezes dropped

FEDIR (CONTD)
Turn around slowly
(then)
You really didn’t think it was
over did you Alexis

Brooke looks back inside the package steely-eyed

BROOKE
That’s not

Nestled inside the packing material A GUN

BROOKE (CONTD)

My name
And with that Brooke TURNS -- spinning low to the floor --
ultra fast -- the GUN already out as she FIRES and we--

SMASH TO BLACK

THE END
