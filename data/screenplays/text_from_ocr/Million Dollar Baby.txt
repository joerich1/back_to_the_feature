SCRAP V0O
Only ever met one man I wouldnt
want to fight

INT LA BOXING ARENA -- NIGHT

BIG WILLIE LITTLE sits sweating on his stool in the corner
of the ring Hes African-American a heavyweight and hes
cut bad under the right eye His CUT MAN jabs coagulant
into the wound looks up to the manager standing over him

CUT MAN
I cant stop it

The manager FRANKIE DUNN pushes him aside

FRANKIE
Get outta the building you useless
tit

Frankie drops to one knee and we see his face Its a face
that could only have been cast by generations of potato-
eaters the kind of face that survives famines and frustrates
invaders Look deep into his eyes and you can see this man
has been knocked to his knees but hes always come up before
the count Always will Frankie picks up the kit and goes
to work on Big Willie Were mesmerized by Frankies hands
Its like watching a top surgeon going for a world speed
record

SCRAP VO
When I met him he was already the
best cut man in the business Started
training and managing in the 60s
but he never lost his gift

Frankie cleans and flushes the wound with an adrenaline
solution uses his thumbs to work the blood away from the
gash and packs it with a coagulant-rich salve

BIG WILLIE
You stop it

Frankie glances at his stop watch 36 seconds elapsed

The RING DOCTOR wants to see Willys face

FRANKIE (CONTD)
Hes fine

RING DOCTOR
He aint if you dont stop that
bleeding Ill give you one more
round

Ring Doctor moves away as the ref whistles the five second
warning

BIG WILLIE
What do we do Tell me what to do

FRANKIE
Just let him hit you

Frankie climbs out of the ring leaving Big Willie staring
at him confused as the bell rings

SURAP V0O
Sometimes theres just nothing you
can do

Willie tosses a couple of questioning looks back to Frankie
before he steps into punching range

SCRAP VO (CONTD)
Cuts too wide too close to the
bone maybe you got a severed vein

Big Willie unwilling to follow Frankies instructions keeps
protecting his face his opponent trying to get to the wound
Frankie YELLS something from the corner Something we cant
hear over the din

SCRAP VO (CONTD)
Or you just cant get the coagulant
deep enough

(MORE)

Willie reluctantly drops his guard His opponent delivers a
neck-snapping blow to his cut eye SILENCE as the camera
screams into an extreme close up of Willies wound and in
that second we hear the coagulant being absorbed deep into
the gash “hear the blood vessels sealing then we fly right
back out into the fight and the ROAR of the crowd

Willy backs off looks to Frankie who screams for him to
get in there and start punching

There are all kinds of combinations
you come up against down in the
different layers of meat And Frankie
knew how to work every one

Big Willie lands his first solid combination and a cheer
vises up

SCRAP VO (CONTD)
Harder thing to stop is looking

FACES
in the crowd Most of them ugly Screaming for blood

SCRAP VO (CONTD)
People love violence Theyll watch
a cock slash a roosters throat
they slow down at car wrecks to check
for bodies Theyll stand outside a
bar watch two friends stab each
other with knives Same people claim
to love boxing They got no idea
what it is

We find
A GIRL
fair thin looks early thirties call her MAGGIE Shes
standing in the tunnel a bruise swelling on her cheek her
hair matted from dried sweat a worn boxing robe pulled around

her shoulders

SCRAP VO (CONTD)
Boxing is about respect

Her eyes stay fixed on

FRANKIE
Hello

INT EVERGREEN REHAB CENTER -- NIGHT 165

Frankie hustles down the corridor met by an intern who
talks as he tries to keep up

SCRAP VO
In the middle of the night Maggied
found her own solution She bit off
her tongue

Frankie fires into the room shoving aside a male nurse to
see Maggie trying to fight away the doctor by banging her
head back and forth Frankie grabs her head holds it looks
into her wild eyes as the doctor administers another shot

SCRAP VO (CONTD)
Nearly bled to death before they
stitched her up She came round and
ripped them out before Frankie even
got there

He soothes her and lets the shot take hold Her eyes half
closed and Frankie steps away to let the doctor in to stitch

CORRIDOR
As Frankie paces running his hand through his hair
SCRAP VO (CONTD)
They stitched her up again padded
the tongue so she couldnt bite and

gave her a tracheotomy so she could
breathe

Haggis2003

He looks back into the room

INT EVERGREEN REHAB CENTER - MAGGIES WARD -- MORNING

ie

Maggie slowly comes out of it Her eyes find Frankie

FRANKIE

He wipes away the tears that flow down her cheeks

FRANKIE (CONTD)
You just gonna keep fighting me

She blinks once for yes

EXT STREETS -- NIGHT

Frankie walks stops Realizes that he is lost

EXT ST RAYMONDS CATHOLIC CHURCH -- MORNING
Frankie sits on the steps Father Horvath beside him

FATHER HORVATH
You cant do it You know that

FRANKIE

Y do But shes thick Father You
have no idea how hard it was to train
her I had to explain every little
thing things any other fighter would
just do without asking shed want
to know why and how and then shed
do it her way anyway I got no idea
how she ended up fighting for the
title--didnt get there by listening
to me

(beat)
Now all she wants is to die and
all I want to do is keep her with
me And God forgive me but it feels
like Im committing a sin by doing
it By keeping her alive Im killing
her How do you find your way out
of that

FATHER HORVATH

You dont You step aside Frankie
you leave it with God

Haggis2003 iL

FRANKIE
Shes not asking for Gods helo
Shes asking for mine

FATHER HORVATH
Frankie Ive seen you at mass almost
every day for twenty-three years
Only person who goes to church that
much is the kind who cant forgive
himself for something Whatever
sins youre carrying theyre nothing
compared to this Forget about God
or Heaven and Hell If you do this
thing youll be lost somewhere so
deep youll never find yourself
again

Frankie knows its true
INT EVERGREEN REHAB CENTER - AFTERNOON 169

her head
INT HIT PIT -- NIGHT 170
Frankie takes his cut bag out of the locked drawer places
it on his desk Takes several bottles of adrenaline from

SCRAP
I went in to see Maggie this morning
You musta been somewhere else

PRANKIE

Frankie locks his drawer

SCRAP

Haggis2003 115

FRANKIE
tt wasnt your fault I was wrong
to say that

SCRAP
Damn right it wasnt I found you a
fighter and you made her the best
fighter she coulda been

FRANKIE
I killed her

SCRAP

(scoffs)
Killed her That girl walked in
here with nothin but guts she had
no hope of becoming what she needed
to be A year and a half later she
fought for the championship of the
world People die every day washing
dishes and sweeping floors and their
last thought is that they never got
their shot Cause of you Maggie
got hers You know how many people
in this world get that

(beat)
If Maggie died today I bet her last
thought would be I did pretty good

(beat)
I could rest knowing that

Frankie snaps shut his bag but doesnt lift it A moment

PRANKIE
Yeah

He nods and then leaves

EXT EVERGREEN REHAB CENTER -- NIGHT
Frankie sits in his car for an eternity
INT EVERGREEN REHAB CENTER -- NIGHT

He walks down the corridor The night nurse is on rounds
the desk lies empty He steps into

MAGGTES ROOM
She opens her eyes when she hears him He smiles gives her

a kiss on the head He looks her in the eyes the question
hanging there She blinks once he nods

He reaches into his bag

FRANKIE
Im going to put pressure on your
neck itll cut off your air and put
you to sleep okay

She blinks

FRANKIE (CONTD)
Then Im gonna give you a shotand
youll just stay sleeping

She blinks offers a small smile He flicks off the alarm
on her monitor then puts his hand on her throat and looks
her in the eye Asks himself again if he can do this She
gives him a smile and blinks once He leans in close to her
ear and whispers

FRANKIE (CONTD)
Mo Cuishle It means my darling
my blood

And she beams Then blinks and closes her eyes for him He
applies pressure to her neck

ANGLE ON HIS BAG

he removes a syringe loads it up with adrenaline His hand
leaves the shot

SCRAP VO
He gave her a single shot where
they wouldnt see much of a needle
mark It was enough adrenaline to
do the job a few times over He
didnt want her going through this
again

His hand drops the syringe back in his bag
FRANKIE

feels for her pulse Gone Strokes her hair Kisses her
forehead Takes his bag and walks out

SCRAP VO (CONTD)
Then he walked out

His eyes as dry as a burning leaf

INT HIT PIT -- NIGHT 174
Scrap sits on the bench
SCRAP VO

DISSOLVE TO

Scrap sits on the same bench He looks up smiles
SCRAP V0O
And thats when a ghost came through
the door

The person sits Its Danger

DANGER
Got to thinking what you said Mist
Scrap

SCRAP

What was that Danger

DANGER
Anybody can lose one fight
SCRAP

training

DANGER

INT FRANKIES OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 176

Serap opens the door looks in Frankies desk lies bare
save a single key lying on the rough leather

SCRAP VO
Frankie never came back at all

Haggis2003 118

BACK IN THE GYM

Danger throws his pitty-pat punches in the direction of the
heavy bag Scrap passes on his way out

SCRAP

Danger you hit something or Im
gonna toss your ass outta here

Danger is so shocked he actually smacks the bag good and
hard He looks around stunned and amazed and as pleased as

hell And as he throws his arms up in the air and opens his
mouth

INT FRANKIES BUNGALOW -- DAY
Scrap opens Frankies front door pockets the single key

SCRAP VO
Frankie didnt leave a note

IN THE KITCHEN
He checks the fridge Empty

SCRAP VO
No one knew where he went

IN THE BEDROOM

He opens the closet The clothes are gone All thats left
are a few shoe-boxes Curious Scrap reaches up for one

SCRAP VO (CONTD)
I hoped hed gome to find you

IN THE KITCHEN

sits at the single chair and opens the box removing the
letters one at a time All are unopened All addressed to
Katy Dunn an address in Indiana All are marked return to
sender

SCRAP VO (CONTD)
Ask you one more time to forgive
him
INT HIT PIT - FRANKIES OFFICE -- NIGHT

Scanning across the pages of a long hand written letter
We pick out phrases we heard Scrap say Set-in the cedars
and oak trees somewhere between nowhere and good-bye

Haggis2003

Boxing is an unnatural act We finally find Scraps
hand writing the current page

SCRAP VO
But I dont think he had anything
left in his heart

EXT ROADSIDE DINER - MISSOURI -- NIGHT

The place looks familiar It could be that place where
Frankie and Maggie stopped The place with the best lemon
pie in the world

SCRAP VO
I just hope he found someplace where
he could find a little peace

With its rough hewn exterior it looks an awful lot like a
cabin Through the windows we think we catch a glimpse of
Frankie behind the counter But we cant be sure maybe the
owner just looked a little like him

SCRAP VO (CONTD)
But thats probably wishful thinking
No matter where he is I thought
you should know what kind of man
your father really was

FADE OUT

the end
