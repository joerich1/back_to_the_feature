INT JUNE’S MOM’S APARTMENT - DAY

The place is a warm and comfortable mess -- colorful
mismatched furniture funky tchotchkes -- the opposite of
June’s condo

In the midst of the clutter JUNES MOM happily packs up a
suitcase June bursts through the door carrying two arm-
fulls of groceries

JUNE
(quickly)
I’m going to be late getting back
to work I had to go to three
stores to get your fiber
Remember youve got to take it
twice a day

She starts hurriedly putting the groceries away in the
cabinets and fridge then notices her mom packing

amazing

June steps between her mother and the suitcase

JUNE
Mom you can’t keep doing this to
me

JUNE’S MOM

I’m not doing anything to you
June I’m just living my life
Try it It’s fun

She steps around her daughter and continues packing

JUNE
Look just because I don’t choose
to live my life like a carny
doesn’t make it any less
satisfying

JUNE’S MOM
Some people are perfectly happy
being an assistant at Fidelity
their whole lives and that’s
great Youre just not one of
them

JUNE
How would you know

JUNE’S MOM
Because you’re my daughter
Theres got to be some of me in

adventurous gene dying to get out

thing

meeting men on my own

JUNE’S MOM
Sure you meet them you date then
but it never lasts does it And
why’s that

JUNE
Because I introduce them to you

JUNE’S MOM
Because they’re everything you say
you want -- dependable straight-
laced solid career -- but you dump
them anyway Because deep down
you know you could never have the
kind of life you really want Not

truth or not

MILNER
I was really enjoying our dinner
And I am sorry that I left but I
had bigger issues like y’know
the fate of the world to think

about

JUNE
The fate of the world Right

She starts backing away

MILNER
Oh man

Milner slumps against a tree doubling over

JUNE
You should be in a hospital And

MILNER
I just need a mirror
(looks at her)
Please

June rifles her purse hands it to him

JUNE
Here

She starts to walk away but--

MILNER
Hold this light for me

Milner holds out a pen and June reluctantly takes it Shes
about to click the top when--

MILNER
Wait Don’t touch that
(casually)
Just turn the cap

June does and the pen turns into a strangely high-powered
flashlight It illuminates a bloody wound on Milner’s side

JUNE
My God you’ve been shot

MILNER
It happens

June goes gray as Milner sets some supplies next to her purse
and starts prepping

JUNE

It goes all the way through
MILNER

Finally some good news
JUNE

I think I’m gonna be sick--
MILNER

Don’t look

As June turns away she moves the flashlight completely off
the wound

MILNER
Okay I’m gonna need you to look

June holds up the mirror and the light so Milner can see He
douses the wound with alcohol but it’s June who winces
Milner doesn’t feel a thing He pierces the skin sewing
himself up

JUNE

I don’t think I can do this
MILNER

Sure you can just listen to my

voice

June takes a deep breath He goes to work

MILNER
So why were you alone
None of your business
MILNER
Okay

MILNER

JUNE
He was late He got a flat tire
MILNER

JUNE
You owe him six hundred dollars for

JUNE

She looks at Milner as he finishes sewing himself up He
ties off the excess thread with the effortless agility of a
trained surgeon

JUNE
Who are you

MILNER
I told you John Milner
JUNE
Okay what are you
MILNER
That I can’t tell you
JUNE
Why Because then youd have to
kill me
MILNER

No Because other people would

kill you And then Id feel bad
(then)

You might want to look away for

this next part

She turns away And Milner uses the opportunity to remove

the object the action figure from her purse He slips it
into his pocket

MILNER
I’ve put you through enough as is
Okay you can look now

She turns as Milner stands and buttons his stained bloody
shirt He takes out the gun expertly jacks the clip and
puts it back again He re-holsters it looks at her

MILNER
Dont worry June Youll never
see me again

There’s something sad about the way he says that

MILNER
Thanks for your help And I really
am sorry for walking out like that
It was very nice meeting you

Milner turns and walks away A beat then June calls after
him--

JUNE
Hey

She approaches and hands Milner some clean bandages
JUNE

You should take these And keep
the wound damp

MILNER So
I thought you had to keep it dry

JUNE
I just read that now they think
its better to keep it damp

MILNER
They keep changing their minds
One minute they say fried food and
cigarettes are bad for you the

next
JUNE
Fried food and cigarettes are bad
for you
MILNER
Huh Well
(takes the bandages)
Thanks -
Milner walks off After a few paces he stops looks at the
bandages in his hand -- damn it He turns and comes back
MILNER

Listen you need to know something
There’s uh some people gonna come
looking for me which unfortunately

means theyre gonna come looking
for you too

JUNE
But I don’t know anything--

MILNER

No but you were seen with me in
the hospital which by the way
is why I told you not to take me
there But--

(holds up a hand)
Water under the bridge Important
thing for you to know now is that
these boys are professionals If
they want to find you they will
They’ll identify themselves as FBI
and tell you some bullshit story
about me It‘’1ll all sound very
convincing but it’s extremely
important that you do not go with
them

JUNE
Okay Milner or whatever you wanna
call yourself why should I believe
anything you say

Milner pulls out a badge barely shows it to her before he
puts it back

MILNER
Because Im in the FBI

JUNE
You just told me what you did

MILNER
They’re gonna kill you anyway

She stands there doesn’t know what to say

MILNER
Now if you do happen to go with
them and they don’t take you
straight to a police station or the

local bureau office If they take
you anywhere else -- even if they
tell you youre safe -- it means

they’re going to kill you

JUNE
If they tell me I’m safe--

MILNER
Theyre gonna kill you Now here’s
the important part there’1ll
probably be a oner in the back

JUNE
A what-er
MILNER
A piece a glock a gat Probably
a 9
JUNE
(shocked) “
A gun
MILNER

Half the time they forget its
there If it’s a Caprice it’ll be
under the seat between your legs
If it’s a Crown Vic it’s ina
panel in the seat in front of you
Got it

JUNE
Dont got it Don’t want it I
hate guns

MILNER
Youll hate them less when you
really need one Trust me

JUNE
Trust you

Milner starts backing away
MILNER
Hey June That kiss was really

something

Milner then turns and heads off into the night and
disappears

EXT HOSPITAL ROOF - NIGHT

Ackerman and one of his AGENTS examine the elevator housing
The door has been kicked off the hinge

AGENT
We lost him

Ackerman sees the trail of blood to the edge looks down onto
the roof of the garage

ACKERMAN
He‘d never go to a hospital I
trained him better than that
INT HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Ackerman steps off the elevator crosses to the admitting
desk Nurse Cheryl looks up as he approaches

NURSE CHERYL
So you’re ready to listen now

ACKERMAN
Who brought him in

INT JUNE’S CONDO - DAWN
As the sun rises we hear June’s ALARM buzz OS
INT JUNE’S BEDROOM - DAWN

June awakens groggily reaches over to the nightstand to turn
off her alarm Her hand fumbles to find it It’s not there

Confused she sits up to see ACKERMAN holding the alarm clock
out of her reach

A ROOM FULL OF AGENTS IN SWAT GEAR stand around her bed all
pointing guns at her Ackerman turns off the alarm

ACKERMAN
Good morning Ms Holyfield
(then)
Where is he

JUNE
Who

ACKERMAN
Milner

INT LIVING ROOM - LATER

June sits on the couch in shock as Ackerman drops a
photograph on the coffee table June looks uncomfortably at
the big red headed guy with braces

ACKERMAN
This one was from San Diego

INSERT - PHOTO OF A DEAD WOMAN

ACKERMAN
She disappeared on a diving trip
in Thailand

Ackerman drops other photographs in front of June

ACKERMAN
This one died in a parachuting
accident Only she wasn’t wearing
a parachute And this one somehow
fell off a moving train

JUNE
I don’t understand

She looks at the photos horrified confused

ACKERMAN
The man you helped tonight has been
posing as a federal agent in order
to lure innocent civilians -- women
-- into helping him pull off
various national security breaches

JUNE
What sort of “breaches”

§

ACKERMAN
I cant go into it other than to
say he usually targets women who
are shall we say vulnerable

AGENT
He gets a lot of women over the
internet

JUNE
(quickly)
Well I don’t do that

ACKERMAN
Miss Holyfield We need you to
tell us where he is

JUNE
I have no idea I just met the guy
tonight

ACKERMAN
Then why did you take him to the
hospital

JUNE

The man fell on my car What was I
supposed to do leave him there

ACKERMAN
No you were supposed to call the
police

JUNE

I tried Look I have no idea who
he is or where he is But I’m
pretty sure that you’re not allowed
to just barge into someone’s house
and--

ACKERMAN
Wake up Miss Holyfield this is
America I’m allowed to do
whatever is necessary to protect
its citizens Now did he say
anything that could be helpful

JUNE
(beat)
We’re gonna be dead for longer than
were gonna be alive

The agents look at each other

JUNE
He also said that he was an
undercover agent on a highly
sensitive mission

ACKERMAN
And you believed that bullshit

JUNE
No of course not

She sits there feeling like an idiot now

ACKERMAN
Miss Holyfield you were targeted
That means he’s not going to leave
you alone Which means you now
need protection

June hugs herself Jesus The news keeps getting worse

ACKERMAN
I think the best thing for us to do
right now would be to hand you over
to the local police let them keep
an eye on you

INT CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT

June sits in the backseat “Braces” drives while Ackerman
sits shotgun June looks out the window shakes her head
Shes broken down

ACKERMAN
This is the first time weve ever
gotten to a victim before he
you know

He lets that hang June thinks about that looks back out
the window

JUNE

You’re going to Bombeck station
BRACES

Uh yeah
JUNE

Fourth Street’s a better way to go
This will run you into the river--

Ackerman smiles at her

ACKERMAN
We know where we’re going But
thank you And don’t worry
You’‘re safe with us

JUNE
Excuse me

ACKERMAN
Youre safe with us

Okay now she’s worried

The car SWERVES and she looks up as the Driver enters a main
highway out of town

JUNE
Where are we going

ACKERMAN
Nothing to worry about Just a
short cut Youre safe with us

JUNE
You said that already

He turns around smiles at her

ACKERMAN
Because I mean it

June starts breathing heavily Shit What to do Just

then something catches her eye A placard on the dashboard
reads “CAPRICE”

June thinks for a moment trying to remember what Milner
said Then she reaches slowly quietly below the seat
between her legs Her hands land on what she’s looking for

June suddenly pulls out the gun She holds it like it’s on
fire like it’s about to go off in her hands--

JUNE
(freaking out)
ALRIGHT EVERYBODY STAY CALM

ACKERMAN
Okay easy

JUNE
Just pull over

ACKERMAN
June please put the gun down
before you accidently--
Suddenly the WINDSHIELD SHATTERS

AGENT
Hey

JUNE
I didn’t do that

Now another shot takes out a chunk of the dashboard

BRACES
Ma’am stop shooting

JUNE
Im not shooting

She puts the gun down Another shot slams into the headrest

JUNE
THAT’S NOT ME

EXT FURTHER UP THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Milner stands in the middle of the street a HIGH POWERED
RIFLE in his hands aiming at the oncoming government
sedan Milner HUMS as he shoots blows out the front tire
of ACKERMAN’S car

MILNERHIGH POWERED SCOPE - POV - JUNE

In the back of the car freaking out

MILNER

Smiles Adjusts his aim HUMS Fires

INT CAR - SAME

As Braces is shot in the shoulder June screams Ackerman
opens his door and ROLLS OUT OF THE CAR

EXT HIGHWAY - SAME

As Milner calmly continues to shoot up the car which now
careens out of control heads right for him Milner waits
blows out another tire sends the car spinning and now onto
its side and all the way over onto the roof

He calmly lowers the rifle as the car slides harmlessly past
him sparks flying from metal scraping on asphalt coming to
a stop a hundred feet behind him

Milner walks around the flipped vehicle notes the GAS
leaking out onto the pavement

MILNER
June You alive

He crouches down beside the car
INT CAR - INVERTED - SAME

June hangs upside down by her seat belt She slowly looks at
him He smiles starts to reach in and unhook her seatbelt

MILNER
Let’s get you out of here

The upside down June looks at him shakily raises the gun to
his face He frowns easily takes the gun away from her

MILNER
C’mon June Knock it off
(holds up the gun)
Rule number one you don’t ever
point a gun at someone unless you
intend to use it Toldja it would
come in handy though didn’t I

JUNE
(dazed) De
The gun kept going off I wasn’t
even shooting I hate guns

She notices gas leaking all around them

JUNE
We should hurry

MILNER
Don’t worry that’s not gonna blow
up the car

He pulls her out calmly talking all the while

MILNER
I felt terrible about just leaving
you like that I’m walking along
all the time thinking “I told her
about the gun yeah but what if
she doesn’t know how to use it”

He helps her to her feet and hurries her over to a black SUV
parked nearby

MILNER
Anyway then I thought “I can’t
leave her alone with Ackerman I
gotta go back” but by then youd
already gotten in the car with them
which I expressly told you not to
do

He puts her into the SUV then glances back at the car
Braces now crawling away from it

MILNER
Hang on a sec

He pulls out a gun and FIRES at the gas-drenched vehicle It
EXPLODES June jumps

MILNER
That’s how you blow up a car

For a moment the entire road is lit up and Milner sees
Ackerman limping off

June is overwrought This is all too much for her

MILNER
Uh June

She just stares at him her eyes start to close He gently
taps her cheek

MILNER
June

She opens her eyes

MILNER
‘Hi You’re in shock I want you
to stay here in the car while I go
have a word with Ackerman Okay
(pulls his gun)
I’m just gonna go shoot him and
come right back

“PEPYS

Milner takes off after Ackerman June watches him go waits
a moment then quickly throws open the door gets out of the
SUV and takes off running through a field on the side of the
road

EXT CITY STREET NIGHT

As June just keeps running into town she loses a shoe
doesn’t stop to pick it up

EXT ANOTHER STREET - NIGHT

Milner races after Ackerman limping in the distance He
takes aim at him when several black sedans SCREECH up beside
the wounded agent Milner is outnumbered He makes a hasty
retreat

EXT CITY STREET - NIGHT

As a BUS starts to pull away from the curb--

JUNE (0S)
Wait

--stops suddenly as June crosses the street directly in front
of it bangs on the door

JUNE
Let me in

INT BUS - SAME

As June gets on looks behind her to make sure no one saw
her She walks down the aisle to the back ignoring the
stares of the other passengers who take in this crazy-eyed
woman scratched up covered in dirt missing a shoe

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Milner hurries back to the SUV

MILNER
Okay change of plan

He stops realizing he is talking to no one
EXT STREET ABOVE JUNE’S CONDO - LATER
NOW SWARMING WITH COPS June’s NEIGHBORS watch from their
condos June steps into FRAME out of breath exhausted
She heads for the nearest cop his back to her
We HEAR THE RADIO INA SQUAD CAR as she passes
DISPATCH (RADIO)
All units be advised female

suspect June Louise Holyfield--

dune freezes Looks at the car

DISPATCH (RADIO)

shooting on Highway 2 Suspect is

June quietly backs away hurries along to the next block
And now Milner’s SUV quietly pulls up alongside her

MILNER
I told you not to leave the car

She keeps walking

MILNER
Now you’ve fled the scene Your
prints are all over your gun

JUNE
That‘s not my gun

MILNER
Hey if you’d trusted me and hung
out just another minute or two I
could have helped you clean it up
Now c’mon get in the car

JUNE
I’m not getting in any more cars
with anybody

MILNER
June--

She stops turns and looks at him

JUNE
Look I know about the other women
Okay
MILNER
What “other women”
JUNE
The dead ones I saw the pictures

MILNER
Right My “victims” Yeah that’s

one of Ackerman’s favorites
c’mon Juné do I look like a
serial killer

JUNE
Serial killers never look like
serial killers

She starts walking again

MILNER -
Well you should know that violence
to me is always a last resort

JUNE
Nice meeting you John Or
whatever your real name is

MILNER
And the only people I’ve actually
killed-—

She stops again That doesnt make her feel better

MILNER
Okay let me put it another way
Ive never killed any women or
children Not that that hasnt
complicated things in the past but
that’s a rule I live by

She just looks at him frustrated

MILNER
Serial killer Man I can’t
believe you fell for that old
chestnut--—

JUNE
(frustrated)
Just what do you want

MILNER
Vamos a la playa

JUNE
You want to go to the beach

MILNER
I want a fish taco

June resumes walking Hes insane

MILNER
Really June Im starved We
never even ordered dinner

JUNE
(indicates the cops down
the hill)
They’re all looking for us and you
want to go get Mexican food

MILNER
Standard Procedure in this type of
situation is to do a Stop-—and-Drop

JUNE
A Stop-and-Drop

MILNER
Throw off the Pursuit Vectoring
Protocols by remaining motionless
within the Primary Containment
Sphere for at least twenty-seven
minutes That’ll keep us off the
radar long enough to get on the
other side of the IPW

(off June’s look)
Initial Pursuit Window

JUNE
Why is it the more you talk the
less I understand you

‘ MILNER
It’s simple they think we’re going
out so were going in
(then)
cmon get in the car June

She thinks a moment looks back at her condo finally walks
around the SUV gets in

MILNER
(singing)
Vamos a la Playa
EXT “VAMOS A LA PLAYA” TACO JOINT - DAY

A cheesy taco joint off the highway Milner’s SUVsits in
the parking lot

INT TACO JOINT - DAY
Milner leads June into the restaurant He spots a SECURITY
CAMERA on the wall and leads them to a booth that’s out of

the cameras view

MILNER
This one’s my favorite booth

INT TACO JOINT - MOMENTS LATER

Milner digs into his food June has no appetite She just
glares at him with her arms crossed

MILNER
(eating)
What’d I tell you Good right

She doesn’t answer

MILNER
Feeling better

She still doesn’t answer Milner stops eating and sits back

MILNER
Okay You have a right to know

Milner reaches into his coat pulls out his handkerchief
unwraps it to reveal the plastic action figure he dropped
into her purse earlier

MILNER
This is what it’s all about

JUNE
It’s all about a Burger King toy

He breaks off the head on the edge of the table and we see a
METALLIC OBJECT inside the action figure He picks it up

MILNER
The fate of the world is in the
hands of this little baby--
(accidently drops it into
the salsa)
--shit--

She watches as he pulls it out wipes it off with his napkin

MILNER
That’s the second time that’s
happened--

JUNE
(impatient)
What is it

MILNER
It’s a battery

JUNE
A battery

MILNER
Only not your average Duracell or
Eveready See someone finally
figured out how to convert the
water molecule into its component
elements -- hydrogen and oxygen
So this battery never runs out
Never ever Ever Ever

JUNE
That’s it That’s what this is all
about A battery

MILNER
That’s it Man you’re not very
politically savvy are you June
It’s an infinite source of
energy the kind of thing that
could render fossil fuels obsolete
And lets see what’s the economy
based on

JUNE
I understand the implications--—

MILNER
The joke is they’ve had it for a
long time now Maybe ten years

June stares at the battery as he folds it up in the
handkerchief again puts it back in his pocket

MILNER
Too much money still on the table
with oil so theyve been hiding it
until the right time

JUNE
Ackerman says you stole it

MILNER
He’s right

JUNE
So you did steal it

MILNER
From Ackerman
(leans in close)
He’s ‘framing me

JUNE
But you just admitted you stole it
44

MILNER
That’s right

JUNE
So how could he be framing you

MILNER
Because originally Ackerman and I
were sent to protect it but then
one day I find out hes made a deal
to sell it to the highest bidder
so I took the battery and ran

JUNE
To protect it

MILNER
But for Ackerman to save himself
he’s gotta make me the bad guy I
still can’t believe he did it I
mean he was my partner That’s
supposed to count for something

Milner looks away suddenly becoming emotional He actually
starts to get teary quickly becoming wracked with sobs

JUNE
Are you okay

MILNER
Yeah it’s just I get a little
emotional talking about it I
mean wed been through a lot
together After that mission in
Afghanistan I thought we really
bonded Hell I taught him to sand
breathe

Milner chokes up again

JUNE
Uh

MILNER
(collecting himself)
Anyway that’s why everyones
trying to kill me

pg

eng

JUNE
Us Everyones trying to kill us

MILNER
Yeah well you were seen with me
so they think you know something

JUNE
But I didn’t know anything

MILNER
Not then but you do now

JUNE
Because you just told me

MILNER
Well you asked

JUNE
No I didn’t You said “Okay
here’s what it’s all about”

MILNER
Because you wanted know

JUNE
Look why don’t you just give it
back to the government tell the
truth about all of it

MILNER
(laughs )
Give it back That’s adorable
June Tell me who Who do I give
it back to I don’t know who to
trust Ackerman clearly had
someone on the inside

June shakes her head looks around the joint
MILNER

Right now I just wanna keep it
safe while I figure it all out

JUNE
And I wanna go home
MILNER
Really Because I can’t stop

thinking about that kiss

(she turns back to him)
I just wonder if maybe I wasn’t so 3
busy saving the world maybe you
and I couldn’t spend some time
getting to know each other

JUNE
Im flattered Which is kind of
pathetic actually

(MORE)
ll

JUNE (contd)
But right now I just really need
to go home Can you understand
that

MILNER
Completely

JUNE
Thank you

In one swift motion Milner PULLS OUT A HUGE GUN throws June
into a STRANGLEHOLD and drags her out of the booth to out
in plain view of the security camera

JUNE
Hey-- what’re you doing

MILNER
ALRIGHT EVERYBODY DOWN OR I BLOW
THIS BITCH’S HEAD OFF
SCREAMS Panic Milner FIRES THREE SHOTS into the air A
light SHATTERS on the floor Everybody hits the deck He
puts his gun right into June’s cheek

JUNE
Please don’t shoot me

Milner’s wild-eyed crazy

MILNER
Don’t make me

Milner fans the gun at the room
MILNER
Heads down I mean it I see a
face I’m gonna blow it away
Milner drags a petrified June towards the door
EXT TACO JOINT - MOMENTS LATER
Milner backs out of the door still holding the gun on June
MILNER

Milner locks the front door of the restaurant then throws the
keys into the weeds

JUNE
What the hell’s going on

Milner shoves June towards his car deadly serious--

MILNER
Get in

JUNE
No way

Milner points the gun at her--

MILNER
You can ride in the front or you
can ride in the trunk It’s your
choice

June slides in latches her seatbelt and quickly shuts the
door

With that Milner jumps behind the wheel and hauls ass out
of there

EXT HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Milner drives as June stares forward panicked Suddenly
Milner starts laughing--

MILNER
Man I wish you could’ve seen the
look on your face “Please don’t
shoot me” Your eyes all buggy--
(then)

Put you in the trunk Like I’d
do that I mean really June I
told you I’ve never killed a woman
before

- June goes for the door handle He snaps serious--—

MILNER
I’m sorry

June pulls back her hand

MILNER
I had to go crazy back there It
was the only way to get you out of
trouble There were security
cameras all over Now there’s hard
proof that you’re my hostage

dune sits a moment in silence Not sure if she believes him
A beat then--

JUNE
Why didn’t you tell me

MILNER
It had to look real And it did

He starts laughing again She SMACKS him hard across the
face
MILNER
(impressed)
Ouch Good one

He notices something ahead goes serious

MILNER
Ah here we go roadblock Thank
God

JUNE

You’re glad

Way up ahead in the distance a ROADBLOCK comes into view
cherries blazing

MILNER
Well now that you’re in the clear
you’1l be safe with them

JUNE
Like really safe Or “they‘re
gonna kill me” safe

MILNER
Really safe

JUNE
What about Ackerman

MILNER
He’s after me He just wants the
battery

He pulls over reaches across and opens her door

JUNE ‘
Youre really letting me go

MILNER
Was nice meeting you Jtine And
I’m really sorry for any trouble I
put you through

She starts to get out

MILNER
Have a nice life June

He looks forward starts to put the car in gear but sees
something in the rearview mirror

MILNER
Uh-oh

JUNE

Just then a BLACK OPS HELICOPTER appears out of nowhere

MILNER
Stay in the car

JUNE
Who are they

The helicopter whips up a tornado of dust

MILNER
Shut the door

- JUNE
What-- aren‘t they the cops

MILNER
No--

Milner points to the roadblock--

MILNER
Those are the cops
(pointing to helicopter)
These are the bad guys

JUNE
The FBI guys

MILNER
No Some other bad guys

JUNE
What other bad guys

MILNER
Actually worse guys

JUNE
Worse guys

MILNER
Okay listen to me very carefully
and do exactly what I say Here--

He pulls a MACHINE PISTOL out from under the seat

MILNER
I need you to take this gun and
start shooting at the helicopter
Just keep shooting until it falls
out of the sky or explodes Either
one is good And put on this
vest

He hands her a Kevlar vest which she just stares at
MILNER
C’mon hurry And June this is
important whatever you do don’t

She puts on the vest Milner throws the car into a 180
The second the car skids to a stop

EXT HIGHWAY - SAME

June dives out of the car scrambles to her feet and starts
to run like crazy She waves her arms at the helicopter

JUNE

They start shooting at her from the helicopter riddling the
ground all around her June runs back to Milner’s car

INT MILNER’S CAR - SAME

her attention

MILNER
What did I tell you

JUNE
Don’t get out of the car

MILNER
And what did you do

JUNE
I‘m sorry I panicked

Milner throws the car into drive and takes off heading
straight for the roadblock She holds up the gun

JUNE
I can’t shoot at anybody

MILNER
Sure you can you just need a
little help
Milner leans over and opens the glove box pulls out a FLASK

MILNER
Take a shot of this

JUNE
What is it

MILNER
Tequila

She knocks back a mouthful from the flask and winces

JUNE
I need a lime

June tries to focus as the dashboard opens up and Milner
starts going through an array of high tech weapons

JUNE
I feel fuzzy-- I mean funny

She looks at Milner who locks and loads

JUNE
Okay that wasn’t tequila was it

She begins to fade in and out of consciousness

MILNER
Almost there

CUT TO BLACK
We hear SEAGULLS WAVES
FADE IN MILNER’S HIDE-OUT - TROPICAL ISLAND - DAY

June blinks her eyes adjusting as she sits up on her elbows

HER POV - THE OCEAN

Sunflares kick off the water as an out-of-focus silhouette
emerges from the sea it’s Milner in SLO-MO carrying some
diving equipment and two huge lobsters much like the Mate-
dot-com ad

JUNE
Uh I missed something

She sits up in a hammock beside a hut wearing a bikini top
and a sarong Milner holds up the two lobsters--

MILNER
Hey sleepyhead I hope you like
lobster

June scrambles out of the hammock stumbles

JUNE
You drugged me

MILNER
Was for your own good June You

Milner calmly drops his fins and mask in the sand

JUNE
Where are we What are we doing
here

MILNER

Hiding out reloading relaxing
June realizes what she’s wearing

JUNE
Uh okay Milner--

MILNER

Cmon June I’ve been trained to
dismantle a bomb in the pitch black
with nothing but a safety pin anda
Junior Mint I think I can get you
in and out of some clothes without
looking

(beat)
I’m not saying I did that I’m
just saying I could

He smiles at her and she hits him the face I mean really
nails him one so that he stumbles drops to one knee She
then hurries off down the beach He touches his jaw smiles

MILNER
Wow

He watches her run off impressed
EXT JUNGLE - DAY

June storms through the jungle furious She ignores the
vines and branches that scratch at her and pushes through
them to another beach

JUNE
Shit

She stands there looking out a more treacherous stretch of
coastline She takes a breath and starts walking

EXT HUT - DAY

With the flair of a professional chef Milner whistles
happily as he bastes some fish grilling over coals then adds
some seasoning He grates some cheese over some simmering
seafood jambalaya

EXT COASTLINE - DAY

As June makes her way through the marshy terrain She slips
falls into a puddle of mud up to her waist

JUNE
Dammit

Suddenly a heavy TROPICAL DELUGE slams down on her head
June climbs out of the mud-hole forcing herself forward

EXT HUT - DAY

Milner expertly squeezes out an icing glaze from an icing bag
atop a few fudge truffles making delicate swirls

EXT JUNGLE COASTLINE - DUSK

June drags herself along -- soaking wet exhausted starving
She starts to really panic It’s getting darker by the
minute She can barely see where she’s going

Like a miracle she sees something in the distance She
squints into the gloom Are those torches She can just
make out some kind of structure built into the hillside

Summoning her last gasp of energy June quickens her pace
crawling towards the structure scrambling up the beach

She suddenly stops dead as she realizes -- this is the place
she left hours ago Milner stands there seasoning a
simmering pot over a fire

MILNER
Big island huh

JUNE
If youre going to kill me just
kill me

MILNER
I dont want to kill you I just
want to finish our date

INT HUT - NIGHT

dune comes out of the bedroom showered wearing the sarong
like a dress just as Milner takes a machete and chops a
coconut in half hands June a cocktail in it

MILNER
Here Very refreshing

JUNE

MILNER
Only if you drink like nine of ‘em

She doesn’t move He takes a drink Then passes it to her
She takes it looks around

JUNE
So is this your hideout

MILNER
One of them
JUNE
How many places have you got
MILNER

Twelve No-- eleven the place in
Burma blew up last month

June watches as Milner puts the finishing touches on the
exotic meal hes prepared

JUNE
Everything you say seems like such
bullshit I have-no clue who you

really are

MILNER
Part of me being able to do my job
is people not knowing who I am

JUNE
So am I like your hostage

MILNER
Not at all You can leave any time
you want But

He looks at her

JUNE
But what

MILNER
Why are you in such a hurry to get
home

JUNE
I have a life People who depend
on me

MILNER

The world depends on me And yet
here I am relaxing

(back to work)
Besides theyll kill you if you go
home

JUNE
You have the battery Why would
they want to kill me

He sets a plate of beautiful food down in front of her

MILNER
I was on the run that night when I
saw you sitting there crying and I
have to say you really moved me

JUNE
You told me this--

MILNER
I dropped the battery in your
purse
She looks at him

MILNER
They tracked it

JUNE
So they think I’m involved

MILNER
Well you kinda are involved
(off her look)
But I’m ‘gonna get you out of it
(then)
Cmon eat

JUNE
Youre an FBI agent Can’t you
just talk to somebody--

MILNER
I never said I was an FBI agent
I said I was in the FBI

JUNE
Whats the difference

JUNE
Thats ridiculous You don’t know

Suddenly an ALARM GOES OFF AND ALL OF THE LIGHTS GO OUT

JUNE
What’s going on

Milner looks off sees LIGHTS in the distance

MILNER
Huh How about that The bad guys
found us anyway Maybe you’re
right about the no-plan thing after
all

Milner starts grabbing weapons

MILNER
Think you’re ready to fire a gun

JUNE
I hate guns

MILNER
That’s what I thought youd say

He puts his hand on the back of her neck and squeezes She
passes out at his feet

He looks at her lying there on the floor of the hut He
reaches out to touch her hair but stops himself

MILNER

Howdy Doody lookalike with braces

MILNER

JUNE
Well he’s here

MILNER
Just keep walking

Milner ducks into an alley Presses June up against a wall
They wait up close like this and a moment later the agent
walks by but doesn’t look down the alley

MILNER
Youre right That’s him
(looks at June)
Nice get June

They stay close for a moment Look at each other

MILNER

We should probably wait here a few
extra minutes just to be safe

Yeah

JUNE
Just to be safe

The nice moment is broken however when a

GUN is put into Milner’s ear

Ow

Holding his gun

MILNER

MILNER

(looks into June’s eyes)
Im happy right where I am

She smiles at him And suddenly Braces cries out as she
kicks the man hard in the shin Milner still looking at
June elbows him in the face and now June kicks him again
this time in that higher spot that bends a man over

Milner takes June by the hand and they take off running

MILNER

I think aloha can also mean “I love

you”

INT VERSACE - DAY

As Milner and June duck inside Milner looks out the window
satisfied theyre not being followed he turns to June

MILNER

June looks over as a pretty young SALESGIRL comes over and
embraces Milner

JUNE
“Gianni”

They begin conversing in Italian Milner is fluent and keeps
up with her She laughs at a joke he tells notices a now
self-conscious June standing there

MILNER (SUBTITLED)
Oh yeah I need you to make her
even prettier than she is

SALESGIRL (SUBTITLED)

MILNER (SUBTITLED)
Yes and make sure she gets to
this address by eight oclock

June blown away by Milner’s linguistic skill watches as he
scribbles on a card then hands the girl a BLACK AMEX

SALESGIRL (SUBTITLED)
(eyeing June)
Im very jealous Gianni

MILNER (SUBTITLED)
Dont worry--
(kisses the girl on the
cheek)
It’s just business

The Salesgirl nods “Ah” June looks hurt -- she’s learned
enough Italian to translate Milner’s words “It’s just
business”

MILNER
(to the Salesgirl)
Grazie

The Salesgirl follows Milner over to June

MILNER
‘Elisa will take good care of you

He shuts the door takes off the chain and re-opens it

BRACES

MILNER
Alright lets go

He takes her arm but she stays put He looks back at her

a passing tray

Karl Roves standing amongst beautiful art and you’re there

JUNE

A TANGO starts and Milner leads her towards the dance floor--

MILNER
Come on lets dance

JUNE
Milner I don’t dance Well I

(gesturing to the dance
floor)
--just not like that

She watches them all tango

MILNER
You can’t be a spy if you don’t
know ‘how to tango

JUNE
I don’t tango

MILNER
All right We’ll just have to mix
it up a little

June watches as Milner pulls the BAND LEADER aside and slips
him some money The tango comes to an abrupt end The
confused dancers stop

Milner moves June to middle of the dance floor

MILNER
Just try your best to keep up

The band launches into lively SALSA MUSIC

Milner expertly starts salsa dancing June grins -- she
expertly keeps pace with him dancing with surprisingly
sultry rhythm

MILNER
(wowed )
Okay this was way better than a
tango

The crowd looks on impressed Others start dancing as well

JUNE
So how’s Russo going to find us

MILNER
He already has
(looks off)
The white-haired guy with the thick
glasses He’s looking at you

Milner grabs June and dips her low to the ground She looks
at Russo upside down giving him a great shot of her
cleavage

JUNE
Uh-huh

Milner pulls her back up

MILNER
All those Nobel prizes and he still
needs to be with the prettiest girl

met you

BAM June slaps Milner really hard

MILNER
Now act upset

JUNE

MILNER
Good now I need you to go to the

Milner’s face

Milner reaches into his jacket pocket
EXT US EMBASSY - ROME - NIGHT

The two menacing men escort June out of the car and whisk her
into the building past US MARINES who stand at attention

INT HALLWAY - US EMBASSY - ROME - NIGHT

Junes heels ECHO on the marble floor as she’s led down the
imposing hallway

INT OFFICE - US EMBASSY - NIGHT

June enters to see a WOMAN typing on her computer her back
to June

WOMAN
18500 Euros That was quite the
shopping spree you had today

The woman turns around to face June

WOMAN
I’m FBI Director Isabelle George

JUNE
Look this whole thing is just a
big misunderstanding

DIRECTOR GEORGE
Which part of aiding and abetting a
known enemy of the state am I not
understanding

JUNE
You’re talking about the battery
Milner‘’s just trying to keep it
safe

DIRECTOR GEORGE
Really

Director George stands up

DIRECTOR GEORGE
Four days ago Milner was given
strict orders to bring it in but
he never showed up Since then
he’s been trying to arrange an
international auction to sell it to
the highest bidder

JUNE
No that’s what Ackerman is doing

Director George presses a button
DIRECTOR GEORGE
I assume Milner told you Ackerman
was rogue FBI
Ackerman steps out of an inner door startling June
DIRECTOR GEORGE

But the truth is he’s my best field
agent f

ee

June stares at Ackerman stunned

DIRECTOR GEORGE
Ask yourself Ms Holyfield Has
Milner said one thing that you can
prove to be true

JUNE
(to Ackerman)
He said you were going to kill me

ACKERMAN
Yet here you are

June doesn’t know what to say

DIRECTOR GEORGE
Now it’s time you started telling
the truth

JUNE
Tam Look Milner’s not a bad
- guy He’s just working undercover
for the IIA

Director George and Ackerman stare at her blankly

DIRECTOR GEORGE
The what

JUNE
The International Intelligence
Agency You know it’s a big top-
secret international spy
thing

Director George and Ackerman exchange a look

DIRECTOR GEORGE
Ms Holyfield I have a security
clearance unrivaled by anyone else
on the planet And I’ve never
heard of any organization by that
name

JUNE
(getting worried)
Are you sure

DIRECTOR GEORGE
What I have heard of is the New
Freedom Coalition What has Milner
told you about them

os

JUNE
The-— Nothing--

DIRECTOR GEORGE
We know that they’re trying to
destabilize the Middle East--

JUNE
Isn’t it already pretty unstable

DIRECTOR GEORGE
They’re going after our allies the
Saudis the Kuwaitis the UAE

JUNE
Milner’s never said a word about
the New whatever--

DIRECTOR GEORGE
--Freedom Coalition Yet you
attended one of their events
tonight

JUNE
What

DIRECTOR GEORGE
We know they’re raising money for
something I want to know what

JUNE
Milner just wanted to meet a guy
named Salvatore Russo to give him
the battery

DIRECTOR GEORGE
Give him the battery Would you
like to see what he actually gave
Mr Russo

She indicates a video monitor Ackerman switches on a
surveillance tape of

ON THE MONITOR

Milner stands with Russo on the roof as in the previous
scene Milner reaches into his jacket pocket then pulls a
gun and shoots Russo dead

June watches the tape horror-struck

JUNE
No that’s impossible

DIRECTOR GEORGE
He’s still in possession of the
battery You see he’s lied to you
again What are you up to Ms
Holyfield

JUNE
Nothing I’m just

ACKERMAN
The last time I saw you you said
you had nothing to do with Milner

JUNE
I didn‘t-- I just met him—-

Director George hits the remote again and we see security -
camera footage of June with Russo

RUSSO (ON TAPE)
How ‘bout I find a couple glasses
of Champagne meet you on the
terrace in say fifteen minutes

JUNE (ON TAPE)
No

RUSSO (ON TAPE)
No

JUNE (ON TAPE)
Make it five

JUNE
Okay that was just me being in the
moment-——

They both just look back at her

ACKERMAN
I gotta say from where we stand
youre starting to look a lot less
like an innocent bystander and a
lot more like Milner’s partner

JUNE
You have no proof--
(then)
Besides the tape I mean

ACKERMAN
The proof is youre still alive

June shifts nervously in her seat as Ackerman sits down close
to her

DIRECTOR GEORGE
I wonder what is it you have that
Milner wants

JUNE
I have no idea

DIRECTOR GEORGE
Well for some reason he seems to
trust you So here’s what you’re
going to do the next time you get
a visual on the battery youll s
give us a signal and well take it E
from there

JUNE
With all due respect you’re making
a mistake

DIRECTOR GEORGE
(losing patience)
Here’s the deal Miss Holyfield
Youre looking at life in a prison
that technically doesnt exist

JUNE
I want a lawyer

DIRECTOR GEORGE
Too bad You can’t have one Life
as you know it is now over You
“may think you’re in Rome but if
you decide not to cooperate with
us you were never in Rome or
anywhere else for that matter
Because contrary to what you may
believe this world is flat and you
can fall off the edge

ACKERMAN
And that’s if Milner doesn’t kill
you first And make no mistake
when he’s ready he will kill you

June reels Thinks a moment Ackerman sets a BLACK BALL-
POINT pen down on the desk

DIRECTOR GEORGE
It’s both a bug and a transmitter
Once Milner’s compromised click
the pen three times and well come
knocking on the door

JUNE
Three times don’t I have to say
“Theres no place like home” first

No one laughs She sighs picks up the pen stares at it

DIRECTOR GEORGE
As long as you have the pen we’ll
hear everything so youll be safe

JUNE
And if I do this

DIRECTOR GEORGE
You get your life back

drops it into her clutch looks out the window as the cab

MILNER
There you are I was starting to
get worried

JUNE
- Just doing a little sightseeing

MILNER

He turns away and starts to prepare another cappuccino for
himself as she sits and stares at him

JUNE
So did you find Russo
MILNER
Yep
JUNE

How did it go

MILNER
Good not great

JUNE
But you gave him the battery

MILNER

Not exactly
June’s face falls but Milner doesn’t see it

JUNE
So youve still got it

MILNER
I didn’t trust him after all

JUNE
Do you trust anybody

MILNER
It’s my job not to Hey what do
you say we take a little break
tomorrow and check out the
Colosseum

He sits across from her
JUNE
You have no intention of handing
over the battery to anyone do you

MILNER
Not until it’s safe

JUNE
When will it be safe John

MILNER
Ill know it when I feel it

June stares at him and makes a decision

JUNE
Let me see it again
MILNER
What
JUNE

The battery If you really still
have it then show me

Milner hesitates then reaches into his pocket and places the
battery on the table before them

JUNE
Hard to believe a thing that small
could ruin so many lives

CLOSE ON June’s hand behind her back clicking the ball-point
pen

Milner stares back at her then looks at his cup We see
what he sees the cappuccino begins to tremble ever so
‘slightly He shakes his head slowly

MILNER (CONTD)
It hurts a lot more than I thought

JUNE
(concerned)
What

MILNER
The knife you just stuck in my
back

JUNE
You knew

MILNER
a) Its my job to know

JUNE
Don’t pretend to be hurt It’s all
“Just business” to you isn’t it

MILNER
No Not when it comes to you

He looks sincere June’s uncertain

JUNE
You killed him How could you just
do that

MILNER

He was starting to suspect me He
was going to compromise my mission
It was either his life or millions
of others I had no choice

JUNE
I just want out Milner I don’t
know who to believe anymore

MILNER
I never wanted you to believe me
June I just wanted you to trust
me

Milner takes the battery and puts it back in his pocket then
walks to a door takes out a key and opens it to reveal a
WEAPONS CACHE inside -- guns of all shapes and sizes
He arms himself then looks at her
MILNER
I should’ve left you in the car

with Ackerman I shouldve never
come back for you

Suddenly the windows in the apartment explode and the room
starts to fill with GAS

A SWAT TEAM emerges from the staircase at the end of the

MILNER
Just stay calm

The barrier above them explodes in gunfire He fires offa
few shots

JUNE
No I wont stay calm Because
normal people don’t stay calm in
situations like this

MILNER
Im calm Are you implying I’m not
normal

JUNE

Oh no you’re completely normal
Just your average everyday
borderline sociopath

He fires off a few more shots

’ MILNER
That hurts June Deeply

JUNE
Oh that is so you You know what
your problem is You repress all
your feelings until they just
explode out of you in fits of
spontaneous crying or the need to
shoot something You’re damaged
Milner

MILNER
You want to talk about my emotional
state Fine Let’s talk

He lays down his guns on the floor

JUNE
What are you doing

MILNER
I may not wallow in my feelings and
ery during chick flicks like most
people but it’s because I don’t
have that luxury

Bullets fly all around them June gets nervous

JUNE
I understand Absolutely Could
you pick up the guns please

MILNER
Bo you understand June Really
Because I have the fate of the free
world in my hands That means my
judgment can’t be impaired by the
constant randomness of emotions

More bullets fly
JUNE

Uh-huh Can we just put a pin in
this for now

MILNER
See my job entails a little more
than just getting people coffee in
the morning

That gets to her

JUNE
How dare you Just because I don’t
kill anybody in my job doesn’t mean
it’s not important

MILNER
I’m not saying it’s not important
I’m just saying youre capable of a
hell of a lot more

JUNE
I don’t need career advice from an
emotional cripple

MILNER
Okay that’s it You want your
life back Fine

He takes out the battery and shoves it in her hand

MILNER
This is what they want

She looks at him shocked

MILNER
Give it to them Tell them you
stole it off me

JUNE
Milner--

MILNER
You wanna go home Get your life
back This is the only way Take
it And your passport

Milner pulls out her passport and hands it to her

MILNER
At least you got one stamp

He grabs his guns off the ground then shoots his way over to
the roofs ledge He gives her one last look then leaps
over the side

June hurries to the ledge to see him land on top of a passing
bus

He rises to his feet on the roof of the moving bus then
jumps off onto a DELIVERY GUY on a Vespa knocking him over

MILNER
(to the Delivery Guy)
Sorry man
He hops on the Vespa and speeds away

She actually accused me of being an
emotional cripple You ever heard
anything more ridiculous TI told
her emotional detachment is a
necessary part of the job But
it’s like she didn’t even hear it
How can she drive me so nuts I
swear Ive been off my game since
the moment I met her

(then considering)
Still I guess the question is why
do I do the job in the first place
you know And the truth is it’s
all Ive got Thats why I can do
it so well because I don’t have
anything else to care about When
you don’t have anybody you’ve got
nothing to lose right

then realizing)
But if I’ve been off my game and I
have maybe it’s because I’ve
finally found something I don’t
want to lose

He gathers up the devices in a backpack
MILNER
I really appreciate you letting me
talk this out with you Thanks
man

We WIDEN to see that Milner has been talking to a huge
THUGGISH GUY who is tied to a chair bound and gagged

MILNER
You’re a good listener

He punches the guy in the face knocking him unconscious

INT FINE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

June sits down at the bar in the restaurant where she and
Milner first met The BARTENDER steps over

She looks over to the empty table where she sat with Milner

JUNE
(to the bartender)

He pours her a drink She downs it quickly then passes the
glass back to him

JUNE
Another

He pours her another She sits there feeling out of sorts
She pulls out her passport and opens it up

JUNE
At least I got one stamp

She examines the stamp when a puzzled look crosses her face
ON THE PASSPORT

Its not an Italian stamp but a stamped picture of an IGLOO
and beneath it the numbers 64 14 23 153 37 03”

JUNE
Milner
(to the bartender)
Hey these numbers mean anything to
you

She shows them to him

BARTENDER

She throws down some cash and hurries out
INT JUNE’S BEDROOM - DAY

June looks at the numbers on her passport and does a Google
search on her laptop She comes up empty

She looks at the numbers in the passport again gets an idea

JUNE
Wait

She goes to a geographical locator website and types in the
numbers

JUNE
Longitude 64 14 23 Latitude
153 37 03
The site displays the coordinates as a dot on a map -- a

remote location in northern Alaska She smiles That’s it
MONTAGE - JUNE’S TRANSFORMATION

-- June walks through her office carrying a box of her
belongings Her co-workers and a confused Mr Hearn look on
as she strides into the elevator and leaves

-- At a bank June sits at a desk with a BANKER He hands
her a thick stack of bills She shakes his hand and leaves
He turns to his computer where we see his screen displays
“HOLYFIELD JUNE” with the words “CHECKING” “SAVINGS”
401K and “IRA” beneath With a click of his mouse the
word “CLOSED” appears beside each one

-- At a newsstand June snaps up copies of Eye Spy Guns and
Ammo Future Weapons She’s about to leave when she doubles
back grabbing Cosmo

-- In her apartment June tosses her various tasteful-yet-
bland outfits from her closet into onto a large pile in the
middle of her floor Finally she stands in the closet
amidst empty racks She looks determined

-- In a department store June tries on various “spy” outfits
with no luck -- one’s too bulky the next too “army surplus”
another too constricting etc

CLOSE ON JUNE’S FACE

She smiles Whatever she’s wearing now that’s the one

INT SEATTLE-TACOMA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

A PAIR OF SLEEK BOOTS struts confidently through the

around and stares after her

guy steps up beside her

SCARY GUY

JUNE

Two other equally SCARY-LOOKING guys step up beside her box
her in They show her they’re holding guns under their
coats She sighs wearily

JUNE
You guys just love your guns don’t
you

They herd her into a waiting black sedan
INT DARK ROOM - DAY

We are back where we were in the first scene June’s seated
at a metal table handcuffed as the Scary Guys stand
menacingly nearby June just sits there thinking in silence
-- having replayed the whole story of her past week solely in
her mind The Scary Guys wait expectantly

MAN

here So do it

JUNE

bad guys or the worse guys or some
other guys entirely But the one

assholes

The Man looks on incredulous

JUNE
Honestly if this was last week we
might be having a whole different
conversation here But a lot’s
happened to me since then So

The Man nods to one of his cohorts who grabs June’s arm
rolls up her sleeve She stares in horror as she’s injected
with a needle

JUNE
What is that Heroin Is that

-a junkie

MAN

MAN

She looks at

We hear GUNSHOTS OS and now the sound of MEN scurrying about

JUNE
-But then what

Another gunman behind them Milner pivots shoots over
June’s head

WeEe

JUNE

A GRENADE rolls down the corridor Milner quickly throws
his body against a door crashes into

AN OFFICE

Pulling June to the floor as the explosion rips through the

corridor They lie on the floor together she looks at him
JUNE

I don’t even know who you are I

Milner stands pulls her to her feet picks up metal desk
chair throws it through the window as June prattles on

JUNE

suave and smart and youve great
taste in clothes Except for your
shoes

Milner looks offended
MILNER
Whats wrong with my shoes These

JUNE

MILNER
Yes they do

JUNE
The point is I don’t know if you
-can have ever anyone else in your

enjoy the time we’ve got together

He lifts her up to the window she starts to climb out
looks back at him
MILNER
June--
JUNE

And you are really sexy
GUNSHOTS RIP INTO THE OFFICE

MILNER
Go

She goes out the window and Milner turns around flips over
the desk gets behind it and takes out the two GUNMEN

EXT WAREHOUSE - DAY

BRIGHT SUN as Milner hurries June away from the remote
warehouse which we now see is in the midst of an icy
wilderness Milner hops on a waiting snowmobile pulls the
groggy June on behind him

MILNER
Hold on

June wraps her arms around him as he fires up the snowmobile
and speeds away She rests her head against Milner’s back
smiling blissfully then closes her eyes and drifts off to
sleep

INT WAREHOUSE ROOF - DAY

Through binoculars someone watches Milner and June speed
away on the snowmobile

EXT ALASKAN COMPOUND - DAY

An isolated military-like compound sits hidden away amidst
the snowy mountains

INT COMPOUND GUEST ROOM - DAY

June awakens looks around to find herself in a well-
appointed bedroom -- satin sheets tasteful furniture etc
She takes in the strange surroundings and grins

She’s getting used to this

On a nightstand next to her lies a handwritten note She

picks it up It reads “JUNE STAY PUT BUT IF YOU CANT
THERE’S A MACHINE GUN IN THE DRAWER -- XOXO MILNER”

She opens the drawer to reveal a MACHINE GUN
INT CORRIDOR - DAY

June emerges from the bedroom holding the machine gun
tentatively She makes her way down the hall when she hears
MALE VOICES approaching down an adjoining hallway up ahead
She ducks for cover in a doorway as the BURLY GUYS walk past
then stealthily continues on

INT ANOTHER CORRIDOR - DAY

Just stand by a doorway leading into a main hall She peers

inside It’s filled with INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSMEN and DICK

CHENEY-TYPES Just then she hears a DEEP VOICE right behind
her °

DEEP VOICE (0S)
What are you doing here

June whirls around raises her machine gun It’s just
Milner doing a voice He laughs

JUNE
Don‘t do that

MILNER
Sorry You know for a woman who
hates guns you look pretty hot
packing one

She hands the machine gun to him

JUNE
Where are we

MILNER
Don’t worry Were safe with my
peeps

JUNE
Your “peeps” You mean the IIA

MILNER
The whats-it
(then remembering)
Ohhh Actually I kinda made that
up I’m talking about my real
peeps Come on I’11 introduce
you

He leads her into the adjoining room

INT MAIN HALL - DAY

The gathered INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSMEN smile warmly at Milner
and June as the two enter

MILNER
June may I present the New Freedom
Coalition -- or the NFC for short

Not to be confused with the
National Football Conference who
for the most part have no
aspirations of global domination

Milner pulls her hand from him then turns to a SCIENTIST

MILNER (CONT’D)
This is Dr Raj He’s reverse-
engineering the battery for us

Milner pulls the battery out of his pocket

JUNE
(confused)
But you gave me the battery

Milner looks sheepish

MILNER
Busted Sorry June That was a
fake I had to get the real one up
here ASAP so we could move on to
Phase Two

JUNE
Phase Two

MILNER
Production

He sets the battery down on a table

DR RAJ
Were going to make thousands of
them

MILNER

And here’s the kicker Once we
start the big war in the Middle
East and choke off the world’s oil

supply -- BAM -- we appear with
the solution We’re going to be
bazillionaires

(then)

(MORE)

MILNER (contd)
I know that’s not really a number
but when were in charge we’ll
make it one-

JUNE
I don’t understand

DR RAJ
My dear it’s very simple Once we
destabilize the global economy we
can use our power to build a better
world

MILNER
Sure there might be a little
widespread panic and general
mayhem But you can’t make a “free-
world frittata” without breaking a
few eggs right

The others chuckle

JUNE
Why did you bring me here

MILNER
You helped us throw off the FBI
Ackerman the worse guys and God-
knows-who-else You’ve proven
yourself We want you in the club

He takes her hands earnestly

MILNER
I want you in the club I always
knew you were meant for great
things What do you say

JUNE
I come all this way around the
world to find you -- and this is

who you are

MILNER
June think about it The world is
falling apart We’re offering

mankind a second chance These are
the good guys

JUNE
No These are just a bunch of
‘twisted greedy evil assholes
And you’re one of them

The other NFC members exchange worried glances

DR RAJ
Milner de we have a problem here
MILNER
(waves them off)
Were cool were cool June I

have to say you’re being just a
liiiittle bit ungrateful Think

about this I mean really think
about it

JUNE
Screw you

DR RAJ
Milner

Milner sighs wearily

MILNER
You disappoint me June

He pulls a gun and points it at her She’s defiant

JUNE
Go ahead It’s really been “just
business” to you all along hasn‘t
it

Milner stares her down coldly his gun steady his finger
tightening on the trigger when they hear the sound of a
ROCKET PROPELLED GRENADE being fired

DR J
RPG

MILNER
(realizing)
Ackerman Get down

A missile hits the room and EXPLODES All hell breaks loose
Everyone’s sent sprawling to the floor as the lights go out
debris falls from the ceiling etc

June takes advantage of the distraction She grabs the

battery off the floor and races out the door Milner
notices

MILNER
June

He goes after her as a KLAXON blares

EXT CORRIDOR - DAY

June turns a corner and races down the hallway Milner runs
after her

MILNER
June wait

JUNE
Get away from me ©

EXT BALCONY - DAY

June bursts out onto the huge balcony built against the
mountainside The view is breathtaking the drop-off over
the railing hundreds of feet to the ground below

Milner is in pursuit June heads for a door across the
balcony but stops short when she sees --

ACKERMAN

Bursting through the doorway ahead gun drawn aiming at
Milner

She ducks between two large columns to get out of the line of
fire ‘

Ackerman shoots as Milner dives for cover

Bullets fly in both directions on the balcony before her as
the two men engage in a fierce gun battle She puts the
battery in her pocket desperately looks around for a way
out There are no other exits She stands there at a loss
when --—

She hears the sound of a CLANK CLANK on the floor nearby
A LIVE GRENADE
Skitters to a stop right before her
MILNER
(sees it)
Great
June desperately reaches out for the grenade trying to stay
protected from the firefight Her fingers finally land on
it

She CHUCKS it towards Milner’s end of the balcony then ducks
back between the columns as the grenade EXPLODES

Milner loses his gun in the blast debris raining down on
him

Between the columns June waits nervously Ackerman steps
before her

ACKERMAN
Ms Holyfield

BAM

A bloodied MILNER hits him from the side knocking Ackerman’s
gun from his hands

The two men tear into each other June picks upAckermans
gun off the floor as Milner and Ackerman’s brawl SLAMS them
against the balcony’s railing Damaged by the grenade the
railing gives way

Milner lies half over the side of the balcony with Ackerman
on top of him his fingers locked around Milners throat

June pulls Milner’s gun from the debris

Milner struggles to free himself from Ackerman’s chokehold
then kicks him off sending him flying across the balcony
As the two men stagger to their feet ready to continue the
battle --

JUNE
STOP

June steps between them her arms spread wide a gun in each
hand aiming at the two men in both directions

JUNE
Just stop

MILNER
Easy there June You hate guns
remember

JUNE
You know what I hate more Liars

ACKERMAN
Ms Holyfield I’m here with the
FBI We tracked Milner and the NFC
here to shut them down for good

MILNER
That’s bullshit June He’s not
here with the FBI He’s here with
his clients -- the Worse Guys
(MORE )

MILNER (contd)
They want the battery to power
weapons The kind that can fit in
a suitcase

JUNE
So what You’re with the other bad
guys

MILNER

No I’m not I swear to you I
just infiltrated the NFC as part of
my mission

ACKERMAN
That’s absurd Don’t fall for it

MILNER
That‘s why I left you the stamp in
your passport I knew Ackerman and
his clients would follow you here
Do you know how hard it is to get
all the bad guys in the same place

June is skeptical

ACKERMAN

Ms Holyfield listen to me We’1l
get you out of here You can still
go back to your old life For
Gods sake don’t let him use you
again ‘

It sounds convincing June is torn

MILNER

June you know the real reason I
chose you when I sawyou in the
window of that restaurant Because
you looked lonely And I know what
lonely looks like

ACKERMAN

Hes trying to get inside your
head That’s what he does Don’t
‘let him

MILNER
You were wrong June What you
said when the worse guys drugged
you

JUNE
Uh what did I say

MILNER
That I could never have anyone in
my life That if we got together
you’d wind up alone

JUNE
I said that

MILNER
Well that and you think that wed
have great sex but let’s stay on
target--

JUNE
I did not say that

MILNER
The point is you’re all I’ve been
able to think about ever since I
“met you You’re the best partner
Ive ever had in every conceivable

way
JUNE
Just-- what do you want Milner
MILNER
I want this first date to go on
forever
She looks him in the eyes a beat -- he’s never looked more

serious She makes her decision

JUNE
(to Milner)
I dont believe you

Milner looks wounded Ackerman smiles in relief
JUNE

(to Milner)
--but I trust you

She shoots Ackerman then goes to Milner He takes her in
his arms just as --

A GROUP OF ARMED WORSE GUYS

Step out onto the balcony Ackerman clutching his gunshot
wound calls to them

ACKERMAN
(re Milner and June)
Take ‘em out

JUNE
Milner

MILNER
Don’t worry I got it

He calmly pulls out a detonation device in his hand

The opposite end of the balcony EXPLODES and the Worse Guys
go flying

We hear other CHARGES he’s set around the compound GOING OFF
when --

COMMANDOS

Rappel down onto the balcony onropes from above and swarm in
from every door armed to the teeth They all wear matching
uniforms emblazoned with a LOGO that resembles the famous
shot of the earth rising over the moon

They drag Ackerman and the surviving Worse Guys out of the
rubble swiftly and efficiently disarming them and taking
them down

June looks on amazed

JUNE
(realizing)
The IIA
MILNER
(shrugging)
Were the Watchdogs of the World

June smiles relieved He kisses her

MILNER
You know I’m glad you decided to
trust me before they showed up
because that would have made your
choice ridiculously easy

The commando LEADER drops beside Milner and removes his
goggles We recognize him as the Maitre D’ from the
restaurant where they first met

LEADER
Johnny Milner does it again

MILNER
You were supposed to be here at
0800 I had to do it all by
myself

LEADER
No it was 0900

MILNER
Don’t you remember the plan

LEADER
There was a plan

INT MEETING HALL

June follows Milner into the wrecked room amazed as the IIA
commandos round up and drag away the last of the bad guys
around them -- the New Freedom Coalition their Guards and
the Worse Guys

Sporadic MACHINE GUN FIRE continues elsewhere in the compound
as Milner grabs a bottle of wine and a couple of glasses that
have miraculously made it through the mayhem

He checks the wine label Impressed he pours them both a
- drink

MILNER
(hands her glass)
Admit it This was the best first
date youve ever had

JUNE
It’s up there

They toast and drink

MILNER
So -- wanna do it again

JUNE
Maybe Call me I dont want to
come off desperate
Milner grins
JUNE
Oh I almost forgot
June takes out the battery and hands it to Milner

JUNE
Here Keep it safe

MILNER
Yeah about that this one’s not
real either

JUNE
Then where is the real one

MILNER
Nowhere It hasnt actually been
invented yet

JUNE
What

MILNER
I mean they’re working on it but
it’s still a ways off But now
when it is invented we will have
already taken out all the guys who
were going to go after it See how
it works

JUNE
My brain hurts

MILNER
You get used to it

DISSOLVE TO

EXT REMOTE TROPICAL POOL - DAY

Like in the Mate-dot-com ad Only now Milner dives into the

pool swims under the water surfaces to where June waits
kisses her

JUNE
You know it may be time for you to
meet my mom

MILNER
Id love to Is she like you

June thinks then

JUNE
Yeah She is

and

Just then across the grounds June hears the ROAR of several

jeeps pull up beside a thatched-roof boathouse

JUNE
Uh-oh

A couple DRUG LORD-types and their entourage of armed
BODYGUARDS emerge from the jeeps and enter the boathouse

JUNE
Time for work

Milner climbs out of the pool as June reaches into a beach
bag and pulls out two enormous MACHINE GUNS She hands one

to Milner along with some CLIPS They lock and load as they
approach the boathouse

JUNE
What are you making for dinner
tonight

MILNER

Steak au poivre

JUNE
I love steak au poivre

MILNER

They share a quick kiss Milner kicks in the door of the
‘boathouse as the two burst in GUNS BLAZING and we

FADE OUT

CLEBRELY
