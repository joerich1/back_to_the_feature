LUKE MURRAY 21 lies in bed dead to the world even as the
late morning sun fights its way in Suddenly his SIDEKICK
vibrates to life

He slowly starts to stir as the sidekickworks its way off
the desk and CRASHES to the floor with a THUNK

That does the trick Luke starts to come to On the
surface he appears good-looking even handsome but behind -
his intense blue eyes one can see the residual grit of
bygone pain

He sits up and blearily rubs away the sleep when he notices
his alarm clock Adrenaline hits him in waves

He leaps out of the sheets and slings on a pair of jeans
racing out of the room

EXT STAIRS

missteps and tumbles forward crashing downwards coming to a
stop on the landing below

to enter when suddenly the doors slam shut

LUKE (CONTD)

The conductor grins as the train begins to pull away

Luke pounds on the window in disbelief futilely racing after
the train making his way to the end of the platform when

suddenly --

the woman’s purse away She’s thrown off balance and topples
backwards crashing onto the tracks below

aghast as the train slowly comes to a halt

Well I gotta get going I love ya

Luke goes to take off when he notices some unsavory
characters up ahead Even in the evening twilight Luke can
make out the SPARK of their CRACK PIPES

He quickly bangs a hard right trying to avoid them when
something gives him pause He stops looks all around
surprised to find his heart racing He shakes his head
dismissing his fear when

he notices a fallen oak tree It has pulverized an
ornate HEADSTONE laying waste to its centuries old mortar

He moves in closer to get a better look when he sees an
OMINOUS BLACK BOOK amongst the rubble He picks it up -
wiping debris from its cover

INSERT COVER “DEATH NOTE”

He almost laughs at the title as he flips it open and reads
“THE HUMAN WHOSE NAME IS WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK SHALL DIE”

That wont work for me

SOPHIA
How do you know

LUKE
‘Cause I know

SOPHIA
Trust me All you gotta do is set
it seven minutes ahead

LUKE
Why seven

SOPHIA
Because five doesn’t give you
enough time and ten is too easy to
figure out That’s why seven is
just right It’s enough time to do
what you gotta do but too much of a
hassle to figure out

She grows frustrated with the sidekick and hands it back
leaving a message on the display INSERT -)

LUKE
(smiles)
Right whatever

SOPHIA

Luke come on let’s go

Luke can’t help but shoot one last look at the papers before
hopping onto the train
INT CLASSROOM — FORDHAM

Professor Selby lectures as Luke surfs the web on his laptop

PROFESSOR SELBY
Hierocles said “Law and justice
are not always the same And when
they aren’t destroying the law may
be the first step toward changing
it”

Luke only half listens as he finds what he’s looking for
it’s an article on the Bay Ridge incident

INSERT TEXT “” miracle heart attack gunman struggled
with heart disease”

Luke can’t help but read with morbid fascination The story
is all over the internet

INT LUKE’S ROOM — LATER

Luke throws down his bookbag and moves to his desk when he
notices the Death Note in the waste basket

He pulls it out flips it open and looks at the name he wrote
-- Mark Tocher It has to be a coincidence

Luke thinks for a moment flips through the DEATH NOTE
reverting back to the “Laws of the Death Note Page”

CUT TO

DEATH NOTE PAGE
(The following text is seen on screen as Luke reads aloud)

- LUKE (V0)

Rule - The Death Note will not take
effect unless the writer has the
person’s face in their mind when
writing their name Therefore

not be affected

BACK ON LUKE

onwards He turns on the television and flips to COURT TV

Luke watches as the suspect’s vehicle dangerously weaves in
and out of traffic before losing control and smashing into
several cars

NEWSCASTER (CONT’D)
Oh my god this is terrible

The perp Stone jumps out and makes a run for it as the COPS
frantically give chase

NEWSCASTER (CONTD)
The suspect simply refuses to give
up

Stone races toa twenty foot overpass and to the cops’
amazement jumps down rolls to absorb the impact and races
away with only a slight limp

The cops are forced to double back

NEWSCASTER (CONT’D)
I can’t believe this

Luke looks on as he writes Daniel Stone in the Death Note
He eyes him for a moment then shakes his head at the
improbability of it all

BEAT

Stone draws his gun car jacks a red Mustang and begins to
race away when suddenly the Mustang swerves off the road and
SMASHES into a fire hydrant

CUT TO

DEATH NOTE PAGE - LAWS OFTHE DEATH NOTE

his feet

NEWSCASTER
It appears the suspect has come to
a stop

Two blue and whites pull up and COPS race out guns drawn

NEWSCASTER (CONT’D)
Again Stone is armed and
considered very dangerous
Hopefully he’1ll do the right thing
and surrender

Seconds later the other perp suffers the same fate

I got two hits Both were recent
Both were here in New York

Something is triggering these

complete heart failure on the drop

Could they have been poisoned

I’ve run their samples through
every test known to man Twice
Not one hit Nothing

I thought it might’ve been some
kind of virus like that amoeba
that killed those people out in
Lake Havasu But I didn’t find any
signs of infection during the

The long and short of it is they
all died of heart attacks that
physiologically none of them should
have had I can’t keep calling
it a coincidence Gonna officially
change the cause of death to
undetermined

Alright then Doc Looks like we
have an investigation then

there is some kind of connection
there

He’s a profiler with the FBIs
special crimes unit Real
clandestine bunch

He’s been following these

L (FROM LAPTOP)
I apologize for the cloak and
dagger routine but as you know I
prefer to remain anonymous

Goemmans looks on curiously

L (CONTD)
I believe these mysterious deaths
are more likely than not targeted
attacks

COMMISSIONER
What makes you say that

L

The probability that the victims
would all be male cons whose
hearts imploded in the middle of
committing felonies is
statistically impossible

(beat)
Unless the CIA is up to something
were not aware of my guess would
be that these cons are being
specifically targeted

COMMISSIONER
By who

L
I don’t know

CAPT MURRAY
With all due respect L I agree
with some of what you’re saying
But the truth is we don’t have a
single piece of physical evidence
that supports your theory

L
Yes we do The dead bodies

A formula fades up on the laptop screen It reads Actus
Reus Mens Rea The Result Murder

L (CONTD)

As we all know these are the
elements of murder Now if you
work backwards you can see that we
have the result All of the
victims are dead We also know the
mens rea these deaths are no
coincidence We’ve statistically
proven that So the only piece of
the puzzle we’re missing is the

they’re doing it But I assure
you it’s only a matter of time

“Over the past two weeks police
precincts around the city reported
a slight drop in violent crimes”
Now this might be a statistical
anomaly It might have nothing to
do with these deaths who knows
But one way or the other these
stories have captured the
zeitgeist’s attention

Luke sits up in attention

PROFESSOR SELBY (CONTD)
Granted the terms we’re dealing
with here are pretty harsh It’s
life and death That always grabs
people’s attention But you have
to admit this type of conduct
regulating behavior can be very
effective Do you think the fact
that some criminals have died has
deterred others from acting

would execute anyone I caught

This graph plots the number of

against the corresponding success
rate As you can see the more

they are to succeed If we assume
that this is a conspiracy it would
require several accomplices across
the country

Everyone studies the graph

And with several accomplices the
success rate drops drastically

Exactly And previous experience
tells us that with a conspiracy
like this someone would have come
forward with something by now

you reconcile that with your

hopefully smoke out our killer

INT LUKE’S ROOM - NIGHT

Suddenly he wakes up breathing heavily Something has him
rattled

He gets up and moves to the mirror He’s surprised to see
bags under his eyes

LUKE
Nothing Go back to sleep

He turns to the Death Note eyeing it uneasily honing in on
a distinct Japanese characterword engraved on its binding

EXT FISH MARKET - THE NEXT DAY
Luke approaches TOSH (Japanese 50’s) as he preps for work

LUKE
Tosh can I ask you something
Whats this mean

He hands him a piece of paper with the Japanese
characterword written on it Tosh looks at it pulls out
his lighter and sets the paper ablaze

LUKE (CONTD)

TOSH
That is a word we never speak
Even saying it brings bad luck

LUKE

Luke makes several queries on a reference portal trying
various spellings of “Shinigami” but to no avail when he
hears the door downstairs

INT NYPD CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

“pn”
e the L logo fades up on a laptop screen and Watari
Goemmans Washington and Capt Murray enter

L
Ive reexamined the time of death
for each Kira killing

A string of data races across a large projection screen
behind L’s laptop

L (CONTD)
Each out of state death has been
converted to eastern standard time

The data on screen shuffles about and grows more and more
uniform

L (CONTD)
As you can see a pattern slowly
begins to emerge Monday
Wednesday and Friday mirror each
other while Tuesdays and Thursdays
are similar

DT GOEMMANS
What a weird pattern What does
it means

L
It means there is structure in his
life something he can’t change
Something he’s working around

CAPT MURRAY
So he’s on a schedule

L
Exactly
They mull over the possibilities

DT WASHINGTON
Maybe he’s a pilot and that’s his
flight schedule

L
No I’ve already checked with the
FAA no flight crews’ schedule
parallel this pattern

DT WASHINGTON
But it’s gotta be some kind of
transportation schedule right

L
No not necessarily The anthrax
killer struck by mail He killed
people in three different states
without ever leaving his lab

DT GOEMMANS
So what is it

CAPT MURRAY
(pause)
It kinda looks like a college kid’s
schedule

L
That’s what I was thinking

DT GOEMMANS
Wait a second Are you sayin’ Kira
might be a freakin’ Coed

L
Well I think our guy is either a
student or someone who’s affiliated
with a local college or university
Look at what we know about him
He’s very tech savvy That
inherently trends towards a
younger educated perp Probably
Gen Y or the millennium
generation He’s brash and
idealistic again indicators of a
younger more likely than not male
perp Now couple these traits with
the fact that the e-mail sent to
the Times came from a Wi-Fi network
that was hacked near Fordham
University and I think a rough
sketch of our perp starts to come
into focus He’s probably a’ young

male in his mid twenties
(MORE )

5B

L (CONTD)
He might be a grad student or a TA
Probably Caucasian Quiet Known
for being somewhat reserved But
there is something in his past that
drives him There’s something
damaged about him That’s the guy
we are looking for

They take it all in especially Capt Murray

DT GOEMMANS
Great white guy mid twenties
good with computers and a little
crazy In New York that’s like
two million people

CAPT MURRAY

Well it’s a start Check in with
all the local colleges Fordham
NYU Columbia Pace Talk to the
mental health administrators See
if there’s anyone they think is
suspicious

(pause)
I know it’s like searching for a
needle in a haystack But let’s
try and turn up the heat on this

The men nod in agreement as

INT CAFETERIA - FORDHAM UNIVERSITY

a debate erupts amongst some STUDENTS at lunch Amongst
them is Luke and Sophia

SOPHIA
I wanna know how Kira’s doing it

Who cares as long as he keeps up
the good work

A GIRL STUDENT shoots him a look

MALE STUDENT (CONTD)
What No one wants to admit it but
they’re glad these guys are dying

GIRL STUDENT
Hey this isn’t a video game You
don’t die and respawn three seconds
later

SOPHIA
Yeah nobody has the right to do
what he’s doing

LUKE
(interjects)
I think it’s for the greater good

SOPHIA
How can you say that

LUKE
People die all the time for no
good reason And it sucks
(beat)
At least these people are dying for
something

GIRL STUDENT
Luke what are you talking about

LUKE
It’s the Coventry Dilemma all over
again

GIRL STUDENT
What’s the Coventry Dilemma

LUKE
It’s kind of a long story

The girls all give him a look

LUKE (CONT’D)
Okay well during World War Two
the British cracked the German
“Enigma” cypher It was a secret
code the Nazis used The Brits
realized that the town of Coventry
was going to get bombed Now
their first instinct was to
evacuate the town but then they
realized they couldn’t do that
They had to let the Nazis bomb
Coventry otherwise the enemy would
know they had broken the code In
the end-thousands of people died
Their lives were sacrificed to save
countless others And that’s what
we have here now on a much smaller
scale If you make an example out
of say a hundred criminals you
could save countless innocent lives
and spare thousands of families
from all kinds of hardship Is it
fair Is it right

(MORE)

LUKE (CONT’D)
It’s hard to say But like
Churchill said “it’s all for the
greater good”

The girls look on taken aback Luke has shut them up in one
fell swoop

is your son Capt Murray

I know this must be very hard for
you captain but Luke is a college
student he has a very high IQ and
it wouldn’t be hard for him to get
information from you without you
even knowing it But most of all
he has a motive

(in defense of the Capt)
So what The ballistics didn’t
match up he wasn’t the shooter

L
Yes he was

L gestures to Waturi who brings over a weapon in a red
EVIDENCE bag

L (CONTD)

Lozano altered the rifling of his
gun with a screwdriver that’s
what threw off the lab But the
screwdriver didn’t reach the back
of the gun barrel When you
compare those markings to the slugs
they’re a perfect match

(beat)
He was the man that killed your
wife Capt Murray

An uncomfortable silence ensues

What

They are all taken aback but Capt Murray cuts them off

L
So it’s just a coincidence that
Lozano and Rick Gurtsky one of his
few known accomplices were both
killed by Kira Maybe I11 give
you that But when you couple that
with Brett Gurtsky’s testimony and
the fact that the e-mail sent to
the Times came from a computer near

attends it becomes harder and
harder to say it’s all just strange
happenstance

I spent a lot of time alone
afterwards thinking about what
happened

CHURCH — DAY
sits in a pew
LUKE (V0)
I couldn’t make sense of it all
Because the truth is I let it
happen

breaks down and lowers his head
“110

EXT NYPD HEADQUARTERS - NYC
Luke eyes his father and his team througha window

LUKE (V0O)
I thought about turning myself in
and confessing

Luke begins to cross the street moving towards his father’s
office

LUKE (VO) (CONT’D)
-» but how could I explain what
happened without the book

Luke stops thinks better of it and turns around

LUKE (VO) (CONTD)
I realized I could never tell
anyone what happened but not
because of what they would do to
me No the truth is the book is
just too dangerous I knew it then
and I know it now The world
shouldn’t know it exists Nothing
good can come from it

INT COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL BOOKSTORE - DAY
Luke brings a bunch of books to a CASHIER

LUKE (V0O)
But I knew I still owed the house
for the lives that had been taken
Maybe I could never repay that
debt But I had to try I decided
I was gonna spend the rest of my
life fighting the good fight
trying to help those that were
unjustly convicted Maybe by
saving them I could undo some of
the harm I did

CASHIER
You a L1
LUKE
Yeah
CASHIER

Dont let them rattle you That’s
what the first year of law school
is all about

LUKE
Thanks

EXT STREET - DAY

Luke walks along with Sophia law books in tow

SOPHIA
Im glad you finally came to your
senses

LUKE

Yeah me too
Luke takes her hand in his as they walk past the cemetery
He can’t help but shoot one last look back at the headstones
as we
SLOWLY FADE TO BLACK

THE END
