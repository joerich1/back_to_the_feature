THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION
by

Frank Darabont

Based upon the story
Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption
by Stephen King

INT -- CABIN -- NIGHT A dark empty room

The door bursts open A MAN and WOMAN enter drunk and
giggling horny as hell No sooner is the door shut than
theyre all over each other ripping at clothes pawing at
flesh mouths locked together

He gropes for a lamp tries to turn it on knocks it over
instead Hell with it Hes got more urgent things to do like
getting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts She
arches moaning fumbling with his fly He slams her against
the wall ripping her skirt We hear fabric tear

He enters her right then and there roughly up against the

wall She cries out hitting her head against the wall but not
caring grinding against him clawing his back shivering with
the sensations running through her He carries her across the
room with her legs wrapped around him They fall onto the bed

CAMERA PULLS BACK exiting through the window traveling
smoothly outside

EXT -- CABIN -- NIGHT 2

to reveal the bungalow remote in a wooded area the
lovers cries spilling into the night

-and we drift down a wooded path the sounds of rutting
passion growing fainter mingling now with the night sounds of
crickets and hoot owls

and we begin to hear FAINT MUSIC in the woods tinny and
incongruous and still we keep PULLING BACK until

»a car is revealed A 1946 Plymouth Parked in a clearing
INT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT 3

ANDY DUFRESNE mid-20s wire rim glasses three-piece suit
Under normal circumstances a respectable solid citizen hardly

dangerous perhaps even meek But these circumstances are far
from normal He is disheveled unshaven and very drunk A

cigarette smolders in his mouth His eyes flinty and hard are
riveted to the bungalow up the path

He can hear them fucking from here

He raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back The radio
plays softly painfully romantic taunting him

You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful
To be what you seem

He opens the glove compartment pulls out an object wrapped
in a rag He lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully --

-- revealing a 38 revolver Oily black evil

He grabs a box of bullets Spills them everywhere all over
the seats and floor Clumsy He picks bullets off his lap
loading them into the gun one by one methodical and grim
Six in the chamber His gaze goes back to the bungalow

He shuts off the radio Abrupt silence except for the distant
lovers moans He takes another shot of bourbon courage then
opens the door and steps from the car

EXT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT 4

His wingtip shoes crunch on gravel Loose bullets scatter to
the ground The bourbon bottle drops and shatters

He starts up the path unsteady on his feet The closer he
gets the louder the lovemaking becomes Louder and more
frenzied The lovers are reaching a climax their sounds of
passion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts

WOMAN (0OS)
Oh godoh godoh god

Andy lurches to a stop listening The woman cries out in
orgasm The sound slams into Andys brain like an icepick He
shuts his eyes tightly wishing the sound would stop

It finally does dying away like a siren until all thats left
is the shallow gasping and panting of post-coitus We hear
languorous laughter moans of satisfaction

WOMAN (0OS)
Oh godthats sooo goodyoure
the bestthe best I ever had

Andy just stands and listens devastated He doesnt look like
much of a killer now hes just a sad little man on a dirt
path in the woods tears streaming down his face a loaded gun
held loosely at his side A pathetic figure really

THE JURY listens like a gallery of mannequins on display
pale-faced and stupefied

DA (OS)
Mr Dufresne describe the
confrontation you had with your
wife the night she was murdered

ANDY DUFRESNE

is on the witness stand hands folded suit and tie pressed
hair meticulously combed He speaks in soft measured tones

ANDY
It was very bitter She said she
was glad I knew that she hated all
the sneaking around She said she
wanted a divorce in Reno

DA
What was your response

ANDY
I told her I would not grant one

DA
(refers to his notes)
Ill see you in Hell before I see
you in Reno Those were the words
you used Mr Dufresne according
to the testimony of your neighbors

ANDY
If they say so I really dont
remember I was upset

FADE TO BLACK 2ND TITLE UP

DA
What happened after you and your
wife argued

ANDY
She packed a bag and went to stay
with Mr Quentin

DA
Glenn Quentin The golf pro at the
Falmouth Hills Country Club The
man you had recently discovered was
her lover
(Andy nods)
Did you follow her
ANDY
I went to a few bars first Later
I decided to drive to Mr Quentins
home and confront them They
werent thereso I parked my car
in the turnoutand waited

DA
With what intention

ANDY
Im not sure I was confused Drunk
I think mostly I wanted to scare them

DA
You had a gun with you

ANDY
Yes I did

FADE TO BLACK 3RD TITLE UP

DA
When they arrived you went up
to the house and murdered them

ANDY
No I was sobering up I realized
she wasnt worth it I decided to
let her have her quickie divorce

DA
Quickie divorce indeed A 38
caliber divorce wrapped in a
handtowel to muffle the shots
isnt that what you mean And then
you shot her lover

ANDY
I did not I got back in the car
and drove home to sleep it off
Along the way I stopped and threw
my gun into the Royal River I feel
Ive been very clear on this point

DA
Yes you have Where I get hazy
though is the part where the
cleaning woman shows up the next
morning and finds your wife and her
lover in bed riddled with 38
caliber bullets Does that strike
you as a fantastic coincidence Mr
Dufresne or is it just me

ANDY
(softly)
Yes It does

DA
Im sorry Mr Dufresne I dont
think the jury heard that

ANDY
Yes It does

DA
Does what

ANDY

Strike me as a fantastic coincidence

DA
On that sir we are in accord

FADE TO BLACK 4TH TITLE UP

DA
You claim you threw your gun into
the Royal River before the murders
took place Thats rather convenient

ANDY
Its the truth

DA
You recall Lt Minchers testimony
He and his men dragged that river
for three days and nary a gun was
found So no comparison can be made
between your gun and the bullets
taken from the bloodstained corpses
of the victims Thats also rather
convenient isnt it Mr Dufresne

ANDY
(faint bitter smile)
Since I am innocent of this crime
sir I find it decidedly inconvenient
the gun was never found

FADE TO BLACK STH TITLE UP
INT -- COURTROOM -- DAY 6
The DA holds the jury spellbound with his closing summation

DA
Ladies and gentlemen youve heard
all the evidence you know all the
facts We have the accused at the
scene of the crime We have foot
prints Tire tracks Bullets
scattered on the ground which bear
his fingerprints A broken bourbon
bottle likewise with fingerprints
Most of all we have a beautiful
young woman and her lover lying
dead in each others arms They had
sinned But was their crime so
great as to merit a death sentence

He gestures to Andy sitting quietly with his ATTORNEY

DA
I suspect Mr Dufresnes answer to
that would be yes I further
suspect he carried out that
sentence on the night of September
21st this year of our Lord 1946
by pumping four bullets into his
wife and another four into Glenn
Quentin And while you think about
that think about this

He picks up a revolver spins the cylinder before their eyes
like a carnival barker spinning a wheel of fortune

DA

A revolver holds six bullets not
eight I submit to you this was not
a hot-blooded crime of passion
That could at least be understood
if not condoned No this was
revenge of a much more brutal and
cold-blooded nature Consider Four
bullets per victim Not six shots
fired but eight That means he
fired the gun emptyand then
stopped to reload so he could shoot
each of them again An extra bullet
per loverright in the head

(a few JURORS shiver)
Im done talking You people are
all decent God-fearing Christian
folk You know what to do

terrified Especially Andy

RED (VO)
I must admit I didnt think much of

it BROOKS HATLEN is sitting closest to Andy At age 65 hes
a senior citizen a long-standing resident

Andy passes the maggot to Brooks Brooks examines it rolling
it between his fingertips like a man checking out a fine
cigar Andy is riveted with apprehension

BROOKS
Mmm Nice and ripe

Andy cant bear to watch Brooks opens up his sweater and
feeds the maggot to a baby crow nestled in an inside pocket
Andy breathes a sigh of relief

fall into my hands Maybe its
cause Im Irish

ANDY
I wonder if you could get me a
rock-hammer

RED
What is it and why

ANDY
You make your customers motives a
part of your business

RED
If you wanted a toothbrush I
wouldnt ask questions Id just
quote a price A toothbrush see
is a non-lethal sort of object

ANDY
Fair enough A rock-hammer is about
eight or nine inches long Looks
like a miniature pickaxe with a
small sharp pick on one end anda
blunt hammerhead on the other Its
for rocks
RED
Rocks

Andy squats motions Red to join him Andy grabs a handful of
dirt and sifts it through his hands He finds a pebble and
rubs it clean It has a nice milky glow He tosses it to Red

RED
Quartz

ANDY
Quartz sure And look Mica Shale
Silted granite Theres some graded
limestone from when they cut this
place out of the hill

RED

RED
Yeah that or maybe plant your toy
in somebodys skull

ANDY
I have no enemies here

No Just wait

Red flicks his gaze past Andy Bogs is watching them

RED
Word gets around The Sisters have
taken a real shine to you yes they
have Especially Bogs

ANDY

Tell me something Would it help if
I explained to them Im not
homosexual

RED

Neither are they You have to be

human first They dont qualify
(off Andys look)

Bull queers take by force thats

all they want or understand Id

grow eyes in the back of my head if

I were you

ANDY
Thanks for the advice
RED
That comes free But you understand
my concern

ANDY
If theres trouble I doubt a rock-
hammer will do me any good

RED
Then I guess you wanna escape
Tunnel under the wall maybe
(Andy laughs politely)
I miss the joke Whats so funny

ANDY

Youll know when you see the rock-
hammer

RED
Whats this item usually go for

ANDY
Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop

RED
My standard mark-ups twenty
percent but were talkin about a
special object Risk goes up price
goes up Call it ten bucks even

ANDY
Ten it is

RED
Ill see what I can do
(rises slapping dust)
But its a waste of money

ANDY
Oh

RED
Folks who run this place love
surprise inspections They turn a
blind eye to some things but not
a gadget like that Theyll find
it and youll lose it Mention my

or a stick of gum

ANDY

RED

ANDY
Red Im Andy Pleasure doing
business with you

They shake Andy strolls off Red watches him go

RED (VO)

I could see why some of the boys
took him for snobby He had a quiet
way about him a walk and a talk
that just wasnt normal around
here He strolled like a man ina
park without a care or worry Like
he had on an invisible coat that
would shield him from this place

(resumes playing catch)
Yes I think it would be fair to
say I liked Andy from the start

INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY 37

Red gets his breakfast and heads for a table Andy falls in
step slips him a tightly-folded square of paper

INT -- REDS CELL -- NIGHT 38
Lying on his bunk Red unfolds the square A ten dollar bill

RED (VO)
He was a man who adapted fast

EXT -- LOADING DOCK -- DAY 39

Under watchful supervision CONS are off-loading bags of dirty
laundry from an Eliot Nursing Home truck

RED (VO)
Years later I found out hed
brought in quite a bit more than
just ten dollars

A certain bag hits the ground The TRUCK DRIVER shoots a look
at a black con LEONARD then ambles over to a GUARD to shoot
the shit Leonard loads the bag onto a cart

INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY 40
Bags are being unloaded We find Leonard working the line

RED (VO)
When they check you into this
hotel one of the bellhops bends
you over and looks up your works
just to make sure youre not
carrying anything But a truly

determined man can get an object
quite a ways up there

Leonard slips a small paper-wrapped package out of the laundry
bag hides it under his apron and keeps sorting

INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY EXCHANGE -- DAY 41

Red deposits his dirty bundle and moves down the line to where
the clean sheets are being handed out

RED (VO)
Thats how Andy joined our happy
little Shawshank family with more
than five hundred dollars on his
person Determination

Leonard catches Reds eye turns and grabs a specific stack of
clean sheets He hands it across to Red --

TIGHT ANGLE

-- and more than clean laundry changes hands Two packs of
cigarettes slide out of Reds hand into Leonards

INT -- REDS CELL -- DAY 42

Red slips the package out of his sheets carefully checks to
make sure nobodys coming then rips it open He pulls out the
rock-hammer Its just as Andy described Red laughs softly

RED (VO)
Andy was right I finally got the
joke It would take a man about six
hundred years to tunnel under the
wall with one of these

INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- 2ND TIER -- NIGHT 43
Brooks Hatlen pushes a cart of books from cell to cell The
rolling library He finds Red waiting for him Red slips the
rock-hammer wrapped in a towel through the bars and onto the
cart Next comes six cigarettes to pay for postage

RED

Dufresne

Brooks nods never missing a beat He rolls his cart to
Andys cell mutters through the bars

BROOKS
Middle shelf wrapped in a towel

Andys hand snakes through the bars and makes the object
disappear The hand comes back and deposits a small slip of
folded paper along with more cigarettes Brooks turns his cart

around and goes back He pauses sorting his books long enough
for Red to snag the slip of paper Brooks continues on
scooping the cigarettes off the cart and into his pocket

INT -- REDS CELL -- NIGHT 44

Red unfolds the slip of paper Penciled neatly on it is a
single word Thanks

INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY 45

We are assaulted by the deafening noise of the laundry line
Andy is doing his job getting good at it

BOB
DUFRESNE WERE LOW ON HEXLITE

Andy nods He leaves the line weaving his way through the
laundry room and into --

INT -- BACK ROOMSSTOCK AREA -- DAY 46

-- a dark tangled maze of rooms and corridors boilers and
furnaces sump pumps old washing machines pallets of
cleaning supplies and detergents you name it Andy hefts a
cardboard drum of Hexlite off the stack turns around --

-- and finds Bogs Diamond in the aisle blocking his way
Rooster looms from the shadows to his right Pete Verness
on the left A frozen beat Andy slams the Hexlite to the
floor rips off the top and scoops out a double handful

ANDY
You get this in your eyes it
blinds you

BOGS

Honey hush

Andy backs up holding them at bay trying to maneuver through
the maze The Sisters keep coming tense and guarded eyes
riveted and gauging his every move trying to outflank him
Andy trips on some old gaint sugglies Thats all it takes
Theyre on him in an instant kicking and stomping

Andy gets yanked to his feet Bogs applies a chokehold from
behind They propel him across the room and slam him against
an old four-pocket machine bending him over it Rooster jams
a rag into Andys mouth and secures it with a steel pipe like
a horse bit Andy kicks and struggles but Rooster and Pete
have his arms firmly pinned Bogs whispers in Andys ear

BOGS
Thats it fight Better that way

Andy starts screaming muffled by the rag CAMERA PULLS BACK

SLOWLY WIDENING The big Washex blocks our view All we see
is Andys screaming face and the men holding him down

and CAMERA DRIFTS FROM THE ROOM leaving the dark place
and the dingy act behindMOVING up empty corridors past
concrete walls and steel pipes

RED (VO)
I wish I could tell you that Andy
fought the good fight and the
Sisters let him be I wish I could
tell you that but prison is no
fairy-tale world

WE EMERGE into the prison laundry past a guard WIDENING for
a final view of the line The giant steel mangler is
slapping down in brutal rhythm The sound is deafening

RED (VO)
He never said who did itbut we
all knew

PRISON MONTAGE (1947 through 1949)

ANDY PLODS THROUGH HIS DAYS WORKING EATING CHIPPING AND 47

Things went on like that for a
while Prison life consists of
routine and then more routine

Every so often Andy would show up
with fresh bruises

ANDY EATS BREAKFAST A FEW TABLES OVER BOGS BLOWS HIM A KISS

sometimes not

ANDY BACKS INTO A CORNER IN SOME DINGY PART OF THE PRISON
wildly swinging a rake at his tormentors

RED (VO)
He always fought thats what I
remember He fought because he knew
if he didnt fight it would make
it that much easier not to fight
the next time

The rake connects snapping off over somebodys skull They
beat the hell out of him

RED (VO)
Half the time it landed him in the
infirmary

51 INT -- SOLITARY CONFINEMENT (THE HOLE) -- NIGHT 51

A stone closet No bed sink or lights Just a toilet with no

ray of light falling through the tiny slit in the steel door

RED (VO)
the other half it landed him in
solitary Warden Nortons grain and
drain vacation Bread water and
all the privacy you could want

52 INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY 52
Andy is working the line

RED (VO)
And thats how it went for Andy That
was his routine I do believe those
first two years were the worst for
him And I also believe if things
had gone on that way this place
would have got the best of him
But then in the spring of 1949
the powers-that-be decided that

53 EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY 53
Warden Norton addresses the assembled cons via bullhorn

The prisoners keep spreading tar eyes on their work

HEYWOOD
Poor Byron What terrible fuckin

Red glances over -- and is shocked to see Andy standing up

listening to the guards talk
RED

Andy tosses his Padd in the bucket and strolls toward Hadley

RED
Andy Come back Shit

ANDY

ANDY
What I mean is do you think shed

HADLEY

Hadley grabs Andys collar and propels him violently toward
the edge of the roof The cons furiously keep spreading tar

HEYWOOD
Oh God hes gonna do it hes
gonna throw him off the roof

SNOOZE
Oh shit oh fuck oh Jesus

ANDY
Because if you do trust her theres
no reason in the world you cant
keep every cent of that money
Hadley abruptly jerks Andy to a stop right at the edge In

fact Andys past the edge
scraping the roof The only
to the concrete is Hadleys

beyond his balance shoetips
thing between him and an ugly drop
grip on the front of his shirt

The cons are pausing work

HADLEY
You better start making sense

ANDY
If you want to keep that money all
of it just give it to your wife
See the IRS allows you a one-time-
only gift to your spouse Its good
up to sixty thousand dollars

HADLEY
Naw that aint right Tax free

ANDY
Tax free IRS cant touch one cent

HADLEY
Youre the smart banker what shot
his wife Why should I believe a
smart banker like you Sos I can
wind up in here with you

ANDY
Its perfectly legal Go ask the
IRS theyll say the same thing
Actually I feel silly telling you
all this Im sure you would have
investigated the matter yourself

HADLEY
Fuckin-A I dont need no smart
wife-killin banker to show me where
the bear shit in the buckwheat

ANDY
Of course not But you will need
somebody to set up the tax-free
gift and thatll cost you A
lawyer for example

HADLEY
Ambulance-chaaing highway-robbing
cocksuckers

ANDY
»Or come to think of it I
suppose I could set it up for you
That would save you some money
Ill write down the forms you need
you can pick them up and Ill

stunned by this business discussion
prepare them for your signature
nearly free of charge

(off Hadleys look
Id only ask three beers apiece for
my co-workers if that seems fair

TROUT
(guffawing)
Co-workers Get him Thats rich
aint it Co-workers

Hadley freezes him with a look Andy presses on

ANDY
I think a nan working outdoors
feels more like a man if he can
have a bottle of suds Thats only
my opinion

The convicts stand gaping all pretense of work gone They
look like theyve been pole-axed Hadley shoots them a look

HADLEY
What are you jimmies starin at
Back to work goddamn it

59 EXT -- LICENSE PLATE FACTORY -- DAY 59

As before an object is hauled up the side of the building by

tongue and the warm sun on face

He glances over to Andy squatting apart from the others

RED (VO)
As for Andy he spent that break
hunkered in the shade a strange
little smile on his face watching
us drink his beer

HEYWOOD
(approaches with a beer)
Heres a cold one Andy

ANDY
No thanks I gave up drinking

Heywood drifts back to others giving them a look

RED (VO)
You could argue hed done it to
curry favor with the guards Or

feel normal againif only fora

of 35mm film Rooster licks his lips pushes past the others

ROOSTER

ANDY
Okay

Andy whips the reel of film around in a vicious arc smashing
it into Roosters face and bouncing him off the wall

ROOSTER

Andy fights like hell but is soon overpowered and forced to his
knees Bogs steps to Andy pulls out an awl with a vicious
eight-inch spike gives him a good long look at it

pair off in all directions making their choices at random

GUARD
What kinda contraband you hiding

Cells are opened occupants displaced items scattered
mattresses overturned Whatever contraband is found gets
tossed out onto the cellblock floor Mostly harmless stuff

A GUARD pulls a sharpened screwdriver out of a mattress
shoots a nasty look at the CON responsible

untested And there the harmonica will stay

and the others follow suit They step through the hole in the

honest days labor while providing
a valuable service to the community
-- and at a bare minimum of expense

to Mr and Mrs John Q

HEYWOOD

EXT -- HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY 162

A ROAD-GANG is grading a culvert with picks Theres dust and

the smell of sweat in the air

likewise The woman turns back and is greeted by the sight of
a dozen men displaying their penises and smiling brightly Her

EXT -- WOODED FIELDS -- DAY 164
A ROAD-GANG is pulling stumps bogged down in mud

RED (VO)
Course Norton failed to mention
to the press that bare minimum of
expense is a fairly loose term
There are a hundred different ways
to skim off the top Men
materials you name it And oh my
Lord how the money rolled in

Norton strolls into view with NED GRIMES at his heels

NED
This keeps up youre gonna put me
out of business With this pool of
slave labor you got you can
underbid any contractor in town

community service

NED

highway contract I dont get it I

(hands him a box)
Now you just have somea this fine
pie my missus baked specially for

Norton opens the box Alongside the pie is an envelope He
runs his thumb across the thick stack of cash it contains

IN THE BACKGROUND a winch cable SNAPS and whips through the
air damn near severing a mans leg He goes down screaming
in mud and blood pinned by a fallen tree stump Men rush over
to help him Norton barely takes notice

NORTON
Ned I wouldnt worry too much over
this contract Seems to me Ive
already got my boys committed
elsewhere You be sure and thank
Maisie for this fine pie

RED

ANDY
What you hear isnt half of it

world And when it comes back

RED

RED
Jesus They ever catch on hes
gonna wind up wearing a number
himself

ANDY
(smiles)

than that

RED

paper leaves a trail Anybody gets
too curious -- FBI IRS whatever --
that trails gonna lead to somebody

ANDY

RED

ANDY

ANDY

The silent silent partner Hes
the guilty one your Honor The man

ANDY
A phantom An apparition Second
cousin to Harvey the Rabbit

ANDY
Sure you can if you know how the
system works and where the cracks

of my imagination

arrow I had to come to prison to

be a crook

line maybe But Ive also built

warden lets me do all that

RED

To keep you happy and doing the
laundry Money instead of sheets

poking listlessly through the dust for small pebbles Red
waits for some acknowledgment Andy doesnt even look up
Red hunkers down and joins him Nothing is said for the

ANDY
My wife used to say Im a hard man
to know Like a closed book
Complained about it all the time
(pause)
She was beautiful I loved her But
I guess I couldnt show it enough
(softly)
I killed her Red

Andy finally glances to Red seeking a reaction Silence

ANDY
I didnt pull the trigger But I
drove her away Thats why she
died Because of me the way I am

RED
That dont make you a murderer Bad
husband maybe

Andy smiles faintly in spite of himself Red gives his
shoulder a squeeze

RED
Feel bad about it if you want But
you didnt pull the trigger

ANDY
No I didnt Someone else did and
I wound up here Bad luck I guess

RED
Bad luck Jesus

ANDY
It floats around Has to land on

through Some folks sit in their
living rooms and enjoy the rain
The house next door gets torn out

The lights bump off He finishes polishing holds up the piece
to admire A pawn He sets it down with the others -- and we
realize its the final glance for the board A full set

He gazes up at Racquel and smiles Pulls a six foot length of
rope from under his pillow Lets it uncoil to the floor

INT -- REDS CELL -- NIGHT 214
Red sits in the dark a bundle of nerves trying to hold

himself still He feels like he might scream or shake to
pieces The seconds tick by each an eternity

RED (VO)
I have had some long nights in
stir Alone in the dark with
nothing but your thoughts time can
draw out like a blade

A FLASH OF LIGHTNING outside his window sends harsh barred
shadows jittering across the cell A storm breaking

That was the longest night of my
life

RED

Norton spreads his arms evangelist-style spins slowly around

NORTON

vanished like a fart in the wind
Nothin left but some damn rocks on
the windowsill and that cupcake on
the wall Lets ask her Maybe she
knows What say there Fuzzy-
Britches Feel like talking Guess
not Why should you be different

Red exchanges looks with the guards Even theyre nervous

Norton scoops a handful rocks off the sill He hurls them at
the wall one at a time shattering them punctuating his words

NORTON
Its a conspiracy (SMASH) Thats
what this is (SMASH) Its one big
damn conspiracy (SMASH) And
everyones in on it (SMASH)
Including her

He sends the last rock whizzing right at Racquel
No smash

It takes a moment for this to sink in All eyes go to her
rock went through her Theres a small hole in the poster

where her navel used to be

The

You could hear a pin drop Norton reaches up sinks his finger

into the hole He keeps pushingand his entire hand

disappears into the wall

ANGLE FROM BEHIND POSTER 221

as Norton rips the poster from before our eyes Stunned faces
peer in CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACKto reveal the long
crumbling tunnel in the wall

INT -- ANDYS CELL -- MINUTES LATER 222

RORY TREMONT a guard barely out of his teens tries not to
look nervous as they lash a rope around his chest Hes
getting instructions from six different people at once

RED (VO)

They got this skinny kid named Rory
Tremont to go in the hole He wasnt
much in the brains department but
he possessed the one most important
qualification for the job

(they slap a flashlight
in his hands)
-he was willing to go

INT -- TUNNEL -- DAY 223
Rory squeezes down the tunnel on his belly

RED (VO)
Probably thought hed win a Bronze
Star or something

INT -- VERTICAL SHAFT -- DAY 224

Dark as midnight Concrete walls rise on both sides If you
imagine them as two huge slices of bread the meat of this
particular sandwich is about three feet of airspace and a dark
tangle of pipes between the cellblocks Rorys appears shining
his flashlight down the shaft Somewhere a rat SQUEAKS

RED (VO)
It was his third day on the job

RORY
Warden Theres a space here
between the walls bout three feet
across Smells pretty damn bad

NORTON (0S)
I dont care what it smells like

HADLEY (0S)
Go on boy We got a hold of you

Looking none too happy about it Rory squeezes from the tunnel
and dangles into the shaft He gets lowered shining his

light smothered by darkness Not having a good time

RORY
Hoo-whee Smells gettin worse

NORTON (OS)
Never mind I said Just keep going

RORY
Smells pretty damn bad Warden In
fact it smells just like shit

His feet touch the ground -- or what he assumed was the
ground Its not In fact its just what it smells like He
sinks in past his ankles He slips and sits heavily in it

RORY
Oh God thats what it is its

225 INT -- ANDYS CELL -- DAY 225
Red and others listen to violent barfing from below

RED (VO)
And then came the unmistakable
sound of Rory Tremont losing his
last few meals The whole cellblock
heard it I mean it echoed

Thats it for Red He starts laughing Laughing hell hes
bellowing laughter laughing so hard he has to hold himself
laughing so hard tears are pouring down his cheeks The look
of rage on Nortons face makes him laugh all the harder

226 INT -- SOLITARY WING -- NIGHT 226

228 EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- WIDE SHOT -- DAY 228
Virgin landscape Charming rural road Suddenly State Police
cruisers rocket up the road with SIRENS AND LIGHTS

RED (VO)
In 1966 Andy Dufresne escaped from
Shawshank Prison

229 EXT -- FIELD -- DAY 229

Shawshank is half a mile distant WE TRACK ALONG a muddy creel
as STATE TROOPERS and PRISON GUARDS scour the brush A TROOPEE
fishes a prison uniform out of the creek with a long stick

RED (VO)
All they found of him was a muddy
set of prison clothes a bar of
soap and an old rock-hammer damn
near worn down to the nub

TROOPER g2 pulls the rock-hammer from the weeds SWISH PAN
to a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER His FLASHBULB GLARE produces

230 A BLACK AND WHITE STILL PHOTO 230

of the hapless cops posing with Andys reeking uniform and the
worn rock-hammer PUSH IN on the hammer

RED (VO)
I remember thinking it would take a
man six hundred years to tunnel
through the wall with it Andy did
it in less than twenty

231 INT -- ANDYS CELL -- NIGHT 231
Once again we see Andy using the rock-hammer to scratch his

name into the cement Suddenly a palm-sized chunk of cement
pops free and hits the floor He stares down at it

232 INT -- ANDYS CELL -- NIGHT 232

Andy lies in the dark studying the chunk of concrete in his
hands Considering the possibilities Wrestling with hope

RED (VO)
Andy loved geology I imagine it
appealed to his meticulous nature
An ice age here a million years of
mountain-building there plates of
bedrock grinding against each other
over a span of millennia

233 INT -- ANDYS CELL -- NIGHT 233

Andy stands peering at the small hole left by the fallen
chunk Carefully runs his fingertip over it

RED (VO)
Geology is the study of pressure
and time Thats all it takes
really Pressure and time

INT -- ANDYS CELL -- NIGHT 234
Rita is now on the wall hanging down over Andys back

RED (VO)
That and a big damn poster

TRACK IN to reveal Andy scraping patiently at the concrete

RED (VO)
Like I said In prison a manll do
most anything to keep his mind
occupied

He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching He smoothes the poster down and
dives into bed A GUARD strolls by a moment later shining his
flashlight into the cell

EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY 235

Andy strolls along whistling softly hands in both pockets
TILT DOWN to his pantleg Concrete grit trickles out

RED (VO)
It turns out Andys favorite hobby
was totin his wall out into the
exercise yard a handful at a time

INT -- 2ND TIER -- NIGHT 236

A GUARD strolls the tier shining his flashlight into the
cells He pauses at Andys bars playing the beam over the
sleeping form huddled under the blankets

p37 REVERSE ANGLE (FROM INSIDE ANDYS CELL) 237

We see what the guard doesnt instead of Andys head under
the blanket its a wadded-up pillow The flashlight plays
across the cell pinning Marilyn Monroe in a circle of light

ANGLE FROM BEHIND POSTER 238

The light illuminates her face through the paper WIDEN to
reveal Andy lying in his tunnel holding his breath The
light clicks off The FOOTSTEPS move on He gets back to work

RED (VO)
While the rest of us slept Andy
spent years workin the nightshift

INT -- SHAFT -- NIGHT 239

BOOMING SLOWLY UP the shaft Rats scurry the pipes Suddenly r
piece of concrete the size of a quarter jumps free and plummets
down the shaft as the rock-hammer pushes through The pick
withdraws replaced by Andys peering eye

A SERIES OF DISSOLVES (1965 through 1966) 240

takes us through the widening of the hole First as big as a
tea cup Then a saucer Then a dinner plate

RED (VO)
Probably took him most of a year
just to get his head through

Andy finally gets his head through scraping his ears Hes
got a penlight clenched in his teeth He peers down into the
shaft At the very bottom maybe 20 feet down a big ceramic
pipe runs the length of the cellblock Beneath its coat of
grime and dust the word SEWER is stenciled

EXT -- LOADING DOCK ACCESS -- NIGHT 241

ANGLE LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN Below us Tommy Williams lies
facedown at Nortons feet Blood is spreading fanning out oa
the pavement Norton turns strolls out of frame

RED (VO)
I guess after Tommy was killed
Andy decided hed been here just
about long enough

Again we see Andy working Norton pokes his head in

NORTON
Lickety-split I wanna get home

ANDY
Just about done sir

Norton crosses to the wall safe and works the dial his back
turned This time though we stay on Andy

He pulls up his sweater yanks out a large black book and a
stack of files lays them on the desk He then grabs the real
ledger and files jams them down his pants and smoothes his
sweater down He picks up the bogus stack crosses to Norton
and shoves everything in

INT -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT 243
Norton exits his office and strolls off whistling PUSH IN on
the open door We see Andy at the guards desk pulling

Nortons dress shoes from their box

RED (VO)
Andy did like he was told Buffed

those shoes to a high mirror shine
INT -- NORTONS OFFICE -- MINUTES LATER 244

Andy sorts through Nortons three suits He pauses checking
the gray pinstripe Nice

INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT 245
The guard BUZZES Andy through Andy walks toward us

RED (VO)
The guard simply didnt notice
Neither did I I mean seriously
how often do you really look at a
mans shoes

TILT DOWN as he passes by Yep hes wearing Nortons shoes
INT -- ANDYS CELL -- NIGHT 246

The lights go out Andy places the last chess piece Gazes up
at Racquel Smiles Pulls the rope from under his pillow

He stands and unbuttons his prison shirt revealing Nortons
gray pinstripe suit underneath A FLASH OF LIGHTNING floods the
cell throwing wild shadows

INT -- ANDYS CELL -- NIGHT 247

The storm rages Andy naked carefully slips Nortons folded
suit into a large industrial Zip-Lock bag Next to go in are the
shoes chess pieces (already in a smaller bag) black ledger en
files Last but not least a bar of soap wrapped in a towel

INT -- TUNNEL -- NIGHT 248
Andy again wearing prison clothes inches down the tunnel
INT -- SHAFT -- NIGHT 249

Andy squeezes through the hole head-first emerges to the waist
He reaches for the opposite wall manages to snag a steel
conduit with his fingers

Suddenly a huge rat darts for his hand Andy yanks away and
almost plummets head-first down the shaft He dangles wildly
upside-down for a moment arms windmilling then gets his
hands pressed firmly against the opposite wall The rat
scurries off pissed

Andy snags the conduit again He contorts out of the hole and
dangles into the shaft We now see the purpose for the rope the
plastic bag hangs from his ankle with about two feet of slack

He kicks his legs across the shaft gets his feet braced Wit3
his back against one wall and feet against the other he
starts down the shaft Sliding dangerously Using pipes for
handholds Flinching as rats dart this way and that scurrying
in the shadows He drops the last few feet to the bottom

He approaches the ceramic sewer pipe and kneels before it
Pulls out the rock-hammer and says a quick silent prayer
Raises the rock-hammer high and swings it down with all his
might Once twice -- third time lucky An enormous eruption
of sewage cascades into the air as if rocket-propelled the
Mount St Helens of shit Andy is instantly coated black He
turns away and heaves his guts out The shit keeps coming

250 INT -- SEWER PIPE -- NIGHT 250

Andy peers down through the hole playing his penlight aroun5
The inside diameter is no more than two feet Tight squeeze
Coated with crud It seems to go on for miles

No turning back He wriggles into the pipe and starts
crawling plastic bag dragging behind

RED (VO)
Andy crawled to freedom through
five hundred yards of shit-smelling
foulness I cant even imagine Or
maybe I just dont want to

251 EXT -- FIELD -- NIGHT 251

Rain is falling in solid sheets Shawshank is half a mile
distant BOOM DOWN to reveal the creekand PUSH IN toward the
mouth of the sewer pipe that feeds into it

RED (VO)
Five hundred yards The length of
five football fields Just shy of
half a mile

Fingers appear thrusting through the heavy-gauge wire mesh
covering the mouth of the pipe Andys face looms from the
darkness peering out at freedom He wrenches the mesh loose
pushes himself out and plunges head-first into the creek He
comes up sputtering for breath The water is waist-deep

He wades upstream ripping his clothes from his body He gets
his shirt off spins it through the air over his head flings
the shirt away He raises his arms to the sky turning slowly
feeling the rain washing him clean Exultant Triumphant A
FLASH OF LIGHTNING arcs from horizon to horizon

252 INT -- ANDYS TUNNEL -- DAY 252

all directions as Norton raises the gun --

-- and jams it under his chin his head snaps back as the wall
goes red His swivel chair does a slow half-turn and creaks to

But there are times I curse him for
the dreams he left behind

He senses a presence looks over his shoulder Theres a Rita
Hayworth poster on his wall He gets out of bed Rita just

keeps smiling inscrutable As Red watches a brilliant
round glow builds behind the poster shining from the
tunnel The poster rips free charred to ash in the blink
of an eye as a shaft of holy white light stabs into the
cell Sunlight Red staggers back against the glare

A whirlwind kicks up whipping everything into the air The
hole in the wall is like a giant vacuum cleaner -- papers
book toiletries bedding -- if it aint nailed down it gets
sucked down the hole toward the light Red fights it but the
suction drags him closer and closer

REDS POV 271

and CAMERA rockets into the hole getting sucked down an
endless tunnel at impossible speed the ROAR of air mixing
with his drawn-out SCREAM closer and closer to the light

Mind-blowing Beautiful beyond description All we hear now

which carries through as Red walks People and traffic He
keeps looking at the women An alien species

RED (VO)
Women too thats the other thing
I forgot they were half the human
race Theres women everywhere
every shape and size I find myself

semi-hard most of the time cursing
myself for a dirty old man

TWO YOUNG WOMEN stroll by in cut-offs and t-shirts

RED (VO)
Not a brassiere to be seen nipples
poking out at the world Jeezus
pleeze-us Back in my day a woman
out in public like that would have
been arrested and given a sanity
hearing

it CLICKETY-CLACK Sparky wheel grinding

The kids get swept off by MOM Red starts bagging the next

customer SLOW PUSH IN on Red Surrounded by MOTION and NOISE
Feeling like the eye of a hurricane People everywhere
whipping around him like a gale Strange Loud Dizzying It
gets distorted and weird slow and thick pressing in on him
from all sides The noise level intensifies The hollering of
children deepens and distends into LOW EERIE HOWLS

Hes in the grip of a major anxiety attack Tries to shake
himself out of it Cant Fumbles the final items into the
bag Walks away Trying not to panic Trying not to run

He makes his way through the store Blinking sweat He bumps
into a ladys cart mumbles an apology keeps going Breaks
into a trot Down the aisle cut to the left through the door
into the back rooms faster and faster running now slamming
through a door marked Employees Only into --

INT -- EMPLOYEE RESTROOM -- DAY 286

-- where he slams the door and leans heavily against it
shutting everything out breathing heavily Alone now

He goes to the sink splashes his face tries to calm down
He can still hear them out there They wont go away He
glances around the restroom Small Not small enough
He enters a stall Locks the door Puts the toilet lid down
and sits on the john Better He can actually reach out and
touch the walls now Theyre close Safe Almost small enough
He draws his feet up so he cant be seen if somebody walks in
Hell just sit here for a while Until he calms down

He glances up at the ceiling beam Brooks Hatlen was here

RED (VO)

290 EXT -- MAINE COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY 290

High white clouds in a blazing blue sky The trees fiery with
autumn color Red walks the fields and back-roads cheap
compass in hand Looking for a certain hayfield

291 EXT -- COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY 291

Walking Searching The day turning late Red finds himself
staring at a distant field Theres a long rock wall like
something out o f a Robert Frost poem Big oak tree Red checks
his compass North end He crosses a dirt road into the field

292 EXT -- HAYFIELD -- DAY 292

Red walks the long rock wall nearing the tree A squirrel
scolds him from a low branch scurries up higher Red studies
the base of the wall Nothing unusual here Just a bunch of
rocks set in stone He sighs Fools errand Turns to go

Something catches his eye He walks back squats peering
closer Wets a fingertip and rubs a stone A layer of dust comes
off Volcanic glass Gleaming black He tries to get the rock
out anticipation growing It wont come its too smooth He
pulls a pocketknife and levers the rock free It tumbles at his
feet leaving a ragged hole

Red leans down and solves the mystery at last staring at the
object buried under the rock Stunned Its an envelope wrapped
in plastic Written on it is a single word Red

Red pulls the envelope out and rises He just stares at it for
a while almost afraid to open it But open it he does Inside
is a smaller envelope and a letter Red begins to read

ANDY (VO)
Dear Red If youre reading this
youve gotten out And if youve
come this far maybe youre willing

to come a little further You
remember the name of the town
dont you I could use a good man
to help me get my project on
wheels Ill keep an eye out for
you and the chessboard ready
(beat)
Remember Red Hope is a good
thing maybe the best of things
and no good thing ever dies I will
be hoping that this letter finds
you and finds you well Your
friend Andy

By now tears are spilling silently down Reds cheeks He
opens the other envelope and fans out a stack of new fifty-
dollar bills Twenty of them A thousand dollars

INT -- REDS ROOM -- DAY 293

Red is dressed in his suit He finishes knotting his tie puts
his hat on His bag is by the door He takes one last look
around Only one thing left to do He pulls a wooden chair to
the center of the room and gazes up at the ceiling beam

RED (VO)
Get busy living or get busy dying
That is goddamn right
He steps up on the chair It wobbles under his weight

EXT -- TRAVELING SHOT -- DAY 296

A gorgeous New England landscape whizzes by fields and trees
a blur of motion ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal a Greyhound Sceni-
Cruiser barreling up the road pulling abreast of us CAMERA
TRAVELS from window to window passing faces We finally come
to Red gazing out at the passing landscape

RED (VO)
I find I am so excited I can barely
sit still or hold a thought in my
head I think it is the excitement
only a free man can feel a free
man at the start of a long journey
whose conclusion is uncertain
297 THE BUS 297

ROARS past camera dwindling to a mere speck on the horizon

RED (VO)

I hope I can make it across the
border I hope to see my friend
and shake his hand I hope the
Pacific is as blue as it has been
in my dreams

(beat)
I hope

EXT -- BEACH -- WIDE PANORAMIC SHOT -- DAY 298

A distant boat lies on its side in the sand like an old wreck
thats been left to rot in the sun Theres someone out there

CLOSER ON BOAT 299

A MAN is meticulously stripping the old paint and varnish by
hand face hidden with goggles and kerchief mask

Red appears bg a distant figure walking out across the
sand wearing his cheap suit and carrying his cheap bag

The man on the boat pauses Turns slowly around Red arrives
with a smile as wide as the horizon The other man raises his
goggles and pulls down his mask Andy of course

ANDY
You look like a man who knows how
to get things

RED

Red shrugs off his jacket and picks up a sander Together
they start sanding the hull as we
FADE OUT
