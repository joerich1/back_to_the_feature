The Great Gatsby

Screenplay by

Baz Luhrmann and Craig Pearce

Based on
The Great Gatsby
By

F Scott Fitzgerald
A BLACK SCREEN
The blackness is pierced by a single pulsing green light
We drift as if by boat across a dark bay toward the light
Then we hear a troubled voice
NICK (VO)
In my younger and more vulnerable
years my father gave me some
advice “always try to see the best
in people” he would say
A gentle snow begins to fall obscuring the light
NICK (VO)
As a consequence I’m inclined to
reserve all judgements

The snow grows heavier

NICK (VO)
But even I have a limit

DISSOLVE TO

EXT SANITARIUM - WINTER - DAY

NICK (VO)
Back then all of us drank too much

DISCOVER A stately Victorian building
NICK (VO)
The more in tune with the times we
were the more we drank
CLOSE ON The sign “The Perkins Sanitarium”
NICK (VO)
And none of us contributed anything

new

everything Only one man was
exempt from my disgust

Gatsby
DOCTOR
Was he a friend of yours
NICK
He was the single most hopeful
person I have ever met And am

ever likely to meet again There
was something about him

Nick wanders slowly towards the window remembering
NICK (CONTD)
A sensitivity He was like one of
those machines that register
earthquakes ten thousand miles
away

DOCTOR
Where did you meet him

Nick stops and stares out the window haunted

NICK
At a party In New York

THROUGH THE CLOUDS New skyscrapers pierce a clear blue sky
NICK (VO)
In the summer of 1922 the tempo of
the city approached hysteria

NICL (VO)
Stocks hit record peaks And Wall
Street boomed in a steady golden
roar

IMAGES OF DECADENT NEW YORK FADE IN ILLUSTRATING NICK’S VO
Dancing girls speakeasies bootleg kings fat cats counting
fresh fortunes and the stock market climbing up up up

NICK (VO)
The parties were bigger the shows
were broader the buildings were
higher the morals were looser and
the ban on alcohol had backfired
making the liquor cheaper

NICK (VO)
Wall Street was luring the young
and ambitious

NICK (VO)

When woman’s shriek startles him

NICK’S POV On the neighboring beach a group of revellers are
frolicking A scantily girl clad waves and then disappears
into the trees drawing Nick’s eye to his neighbor’s house

INT BUCHANAN MANSION - SALON - LATE AFTERNOON

A shimmering sun-dazzled room in which enormous white
curtains whip and snap in the breeze

We hear the giggle of naughty children
BOOM As the French doors shut and the curtains fall a

beautiful white hand rises from behind the couch and with
it a low thrilling voice
DAISY (0S)
Oh Nicky Is that you my lovely

Suddenly 23 year old DAISY BUCHANAN appears from over the
back of the couch Her bright eyes and passionate mouth are
framed by a strawberry-blonde bob

CLOSE ON Daisy captivating

NICK (VO)
Daisy Buchanan The golden girl A
breathless warmth flowed from her
A promise that there was no one
else in the world she so wanted to
see

She whispers dramatically

DAISY
Do they miss me in Chicago

NICK
Oh yes About a dozen people send
their love

DAISY
(unimpressed)
How gorgeous

NICK
They’re absolutely in mourning
Theyre crying

DAISY

DAISY
No--

NICK

They’re screaming they’re
shouting

DAISY
No--

NICK
“Daisy Buchanan we can’t live
without you”

DAISY
Im p-paralyzed with happiness

Daisy takes Nick’s hand and squeals with childish glee as she
drags him over the sofa and onto his back on the floor

He stares up And a mysterious athletic girl glares back
This is 22 year old JORDAN BAKER

DAISY (CONTD)
Jordan Baker a very famous golfer

CLOSE ON Nick the blood drains from his face

NICK (VO)
She was the most frightening person
Id ever seen--

Nick rights himself and extends his hand

NICK
I’ve seen your face on the cover of
“Sporting Life” Nick Carraway

But Jordan merely yawns and stands (we get a good look)

NICK (VO)
But I enjoyed looking at her

JORDAN
Ive been lying on that sofa for as
long as I can remember

Daisy turns to Nick with scandalous delight

DAISY
I know This summer Ill sort of
fling you and Jordan together

As Tom prepares drinks at the bar he glances skittishly at a
white telephone set ostentatiously upon a marble pedestal

DAISY (CONTD)
I’1l push you into linen closets
and out to sea in boats

JORDAN
I’m not listening to a word

Irritated Tom turns to Nick

TOM

Daisy a sharp intake of breath

DAISY
Gatsby

CLOSE ON Daisy as she struggles to control rising emotion

DAISY (CONTD)
What Gatsby

Before anyone can reply Henri announces--

HENRI
Madame le diner est servi

As Jordan WHACKS a golf ball into a makeshift cup - a trophy
on the floor - waiters sweep open the doors and the curtains
flutter up again

DISSOLVE TO

EXT BUCHANAN MANSION - TERRACE - NIGHT

Daisy Nick Jordan and Tom sit at a long sumptuously laid
table Food wine laughter smoking

DISSOLVING ABSTRACTLY Through fragments of conversation
DAISY
Would you like to hear a family
secret Its about the butler’s
nose

JORDAN
Things went from bad to worse

DAISY
Nicky I heard a rumor that you
were getting married to a girl out

west
NICK
Its a libel I’m too poor
JORDAN
They have to be old so they die
quickly
NICK

Can’t we talk about something else
Anything Crops You’re making me
feel uncivilized Daisy--

This draws a strangely violent interjection from Tom

TOM
Civilizations going to pieces
Have you read The Rise of the
Colored Empires by this fellow
Goddard

NICK
Why no

Tom stands and begins to pace--

TOM
Everyone ought to read it The idea
is that its up to us the dominant
race to watch out or these other
races

Tom straightens the bow-tie on his black servant--

TOM (CONTD)
Will have control of things

DAISY
(wickedly)
Tom’s been very profound lately He
reads deep books with long words in
them

TOM
It’s been proved Its scientific

DAISY
(subtly mocking Tom)
We’ve got to beat them down

SUDDENLY BRINNNGGG The telephone All freeze Another ring
BRINNNGGG

TOM
Excuse me I’1l be right back

He goes inside
An embarrassed moment suddenly Daisy throws her napkin down

DAISY
I’m sorry

She follows Tom into the house
Nick at a loss turns to Jordan
NICK
Well this Mr Gatsby you spoke of
is my neighbor
JORDAN
Shhhh Don’t talk I want to hear
what happens

A subdued impassioned murmur is audible in the room beyond

NICK

Is something happening
JORDAN

I thought everybody knew
NICK

I don’t
JORDAN

Toms got some woman in New York

NICK
Got some woman

JORDAN
She might have the decency not to
telephone at dinner-time Don’t
you think

Almost before Nick has grasped her meaning the doors bang
open and Tom and Daisy return to the table

DAISY
(a tense gayety)
I just love seeing you at my table
Nicky You remind me of a rose an
absolute rose Doesn’t he

NICK
I’m not even faintly like a rose--

TOM
So After dinner Nick wanted to
go into town Right Nick To the
Yale club

DAISY

two

Daisy and Tom stare at Nick - both demanding his allegiance

PUSH IN On Daisy as the telephone continues to shriek
NICK (VO)
None of us could ignore that fifth

guest’s shrill metallic urgency

DISSOLVE TO

EXT BUCHANAN MANSION - BALUSTRADE - LATER

Servants clear Jordan and Tom retire to the salon as Nick
and Daisy stroll down toward the water and Daisy confides

DAISY
Oh Nicky

NICK
What

DAISY
Its just well you see I think
everything’s terrible anyhow You
know I’ve been everywhere and seen
everything and done everything and
I’ve had very bad time Nicky I’m
pretty cyncical about everything

Daisy gazes melancholic across the bay an awkward silence
Nick tries to change the subject--

NICK
Your daughter I suppose she talks
and eats and everything

DAISY
Pammy Oh yes

Daisy leans on a stone balustrade and gazes down toward the
dock where a green light glows in the velvet dusk

DAISY (CONTD)
Listen Nick when she was born Tom
was God knows where - with God
knows whom - and I asked the nurse
if it was a boy or a girl She told
me it was a girl and I wept ‘All
right I said Im glad its a
girl And I hope shell be a fool -
thats the best thing a girl can be
in this world a beautiful little
fool’

She breaks off and looks at Nick with that smile of hers
DAISY (CONTD)
All the bright precious things fade

so fast

And as a sad sweet underscore plays WE PUSH out over the
water and across the bay toward Gatsby’s castle

DAISY (CONTD)
And they don’t come back
EXT GATSBY’S CASTLE - DOCK - NIGHT

WE DISCOVER At the end of Gatsby’s dock A MAN - his dark
silhouette is cut against the paler black of the night sky

In the distance behind him we see headlights It is Nick
pulling up at his bungalow

EXT NICK’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT

Nick gets out of his car He stops Through the trees he can
see The Man gazing intently across the bay

NICK (VO)
When I arrived home I noticed that
a figure had emerged on my
neighbor’s dock
Nick goes closer and watches The Man
NICK (VO)
And something told me it was Mr
Gatsby
The Man reaches out--
NICK (VO)
He seemed to be reaching toward
something out there in the dark

A green light on dock pulses in the distant darkness

DISSOLVE TO

INT SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - NIGHT

DOCTOR
Green light

Nick struggles with a painful memory
NICK
I don’t want to talk about this

NICK (CONT’D)
I can’t talk about THIS

DOCTOR
(delicately)
Then write about it

NICK
(skeptical)
Write
DOCTOR
Yes Write
NICK

Why would I do that

DOCTOR
After all you said that writing
brought you solace once upon a
time

NICK
Yeah well It didn’t bring anyone
else much solace I wasn’t any

The Doctor offers Nick a pen but Nick does not accept

DOCTOR
No one need ever read it You can
always burn it

NICK
What would I write about

DOCTOR
Anything Whatever you can’t quite
talk about a memory a thought a
place Write it down

CLOSE ON Nick considering the challenge
NICK
(to himself)
A place
Slowly he takes the pen

We hear the clatter of metal wheels on train tracks AS THE
SCREEN FILLS WITH WORDS we hear them as voice-over

NICK (VO)
The Valley of Ashes was a grotesque
place

EXT THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY

HIGH AND WIDE A vast dumping ground comprised of massive
mounds of smoldering ash train tracks cut through its heart
and the gleaming towers of the city shimmer in the distance

NICK (VO)
New York’s dumping ground half way
between West Egg and the city

IMAGES illustrate the poverty and hopelessness of life here

NICK (VO)
Where the burnt out coal that
powered the booming golden city
was discarded by men who moved
dimly and already crumbling through
the powdery air

A train waits at a drawbridge spanning a small foul creek

DISCOVER Nick aboard the train looking out at the awful
wasteland

NICK (VO)
This fantastic farm was ever-
watched by Dr T J Eckleberg

NICK’S POV A gigantic paint peeling billboard reads “Dr
TJ Eckleberg”

NICK (VO)
A forgotten oculist whose eyes
brooded over it all like the eyes
of God

INT TRAIN — DAY

Tom flushed with booze and heat glances covertly around the
halted carriage Nick sits opposite

NICK (VO)

INT MYRTLE’S APARTMENT - DAY
The muffled sounds of sex

CLOSE ON A puppy mouthing a soggy dog biscuit that dissolves
into a saucer of milk

Nick horrified perches on a couch in a small room stuffed
with tacky pretentious objects obviously bought by Tom

Nick springs to his feet and yanks open the front door only
to be startled by a slender louche girl in her twenties
with a sticky bob of red hair This is CATHERINE

She sweeps into the room pivots and extends her hand

Myrtle sweeps into the kitchen Tom opens the liquor cabinet

NICK
(making for the door)

TOM
(grabbing Nick’s arm)

Tom pulls Nick back toward the party

TOM

MYRTLE

He’s a greasy little scumbag

Tom grins arrogantly and offers a drink to Catherine

CATHERINE
No thanks I feel just as good on
nothing at all

With a suggestive glimpse of tongue Catherine pops a pill

CATHERINE (CONT’D)
Nerve pills I get them from a
doctor in Queens You want one

NICK
My nerves are fine thanks

Catherine smiles mischievously puts a pill on her tongue and
suddenly kisses Nick He splutters but Catherine tips the
scotch to his mouth washing the pill down

NICK (VO)
I had been drunk just twice in my
life and the second time was that
afternoon

DISSOLVE TO Blurry freakish images of time passing The
whiskey is in demand by all Catherine dances a solo The

music is sexy dirty deafening The images become wilder
nauseatingly violent

As Catherine undresses Nick

NICK (VO)
That night in the hidden flat that
Tom kept for Myrtle we were buoyed
by a sort of chemical madness a
willingness of the heart that burst
thunderously upon us all And
suddenly I began to like New York

As the puppy sits on the table groaning faintly through the
smoke Myrtle suddenly springs to her feet

MYRTLE
--Lve got to get a massage anda
wave and a collar for the dog and
one of those cute little ash-trays
where you touch a spring anda
wreath with a black silk bow for

Alone and a little embarrassed I

decided to get roaring drunk
He downs the martini in one gulp steps over an even drunker
guest who collapses at his feet and makes his way out to
EXT GATSBY’S CASTLE - TERRACE - TWILIGHT
Nick gazes out over the impossibly decadent party

NICK
Wow

As unbeknownst to him a mysterious masked guest stalks
toward him from behind

VOICE
I thought I might see you here

Startled Nick turns to find Jordan Baker

NICK
Hello

JORDAN
I remembered you lived next door

NICK
Its like an amusement park

JORDAN
Shall we

Jordan seductively leads Nick down the terrace steps

NICK
Did you get an invitation

JORDAN
People aren’t invited to Gatsby’s

NICK
Well I was I seem to be the only
one Who is this Gatsby

A haughty East Egger TEDDY interjects

TEDDY
He was a German spy during the war

JORDAN
Teddy Barton Nick Carraway

NICK
(to Teddy)
A German spy

Teddy’s annoying East Egger friend NELSON chimes in

NELSON
No no no no He’s the Kaiser’s
assassin

And the third of the East Egger trio LANGUID GIRL adds

LANGUID GIRL
I heard he killed a man once

NELSON
Its true

LANUID GIRL
You look at him sometimes when he
thinks no one’s watching I’1l
bet he killed a man

TEDDY
Kills for fun Free of charge

NELSON
Well he’s already richer than God

Nick turns to Jordan an alarmed whisper

NICK
You don’t believe he killed a man
do you

JORDAN
(wickedly)
Let’s go find him and you can ask
him yourself

As the dance-floor erupts and world-famous dancer Gilda Grey
is announced Jordan leads Nick off
INT GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - EVENING

MUSIC FEVERISHLY BUILDS As Nick and Jordan bound up a
winding staircase Jordan teases seductively

JORDAN
Oh Mr Gatsby
(to Nick)

Shall I lead you into his clutches

INT GATSBYS CASTLE - LIBRARY - EVENING

BANG Nick and Jordan explode into a dark room A stout
middle-aged man wheels to them with unsettling intensity

OWL EYES
You won’t find him

He plucks two finger-bowl sized cocktails from a row lined up
on the table and hands them to Nick and Jordan

OWL EYES (CONT’D)
This house and everything in it
are all part of an elaborate
disguise But Mr Gatsby doesn’t
exist

JORDAN
Phooey I’ve met him

OWL EYES
Which one the Prince the Spy the
Murderer I’ve been wandering his
halls drunk for about a week now -
but no matter where I look I can’t
find anyone who knows anything real
about Mr Gatsby

JORDAN
(blithely dismissive)
Well I don’t care he gives large
parties - and I like large parties
they’re so intimate at small
parties there isnt any privacy

NICK
(slowly to Owl Eyes)
But if that’s true what’s all this
for

OWL EYES
That my dear fellow is the
question

Owl Eyes looks to the window and Nick and Jordan follow his
gaze to Gatsby’s garden where as the band hits fever
pitch and twilight becomes night THE PARTY HAS BEGUN
EXT GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT

As the music nears its final crescendo the evening’s many
fantastical characters dance uproariously around the pool

On an elaborate flotilla in the center of it all Jordan and
Nick are kicking a wild Charleston The number finally peaks

NICK
I didn’t expect all this

JORDAN
(coy)
What did you expect
NICK
I don’t know
JORDAN
Disappointed
NICK

Not in the slightest
Jordan and Nick look as if they might just kiss
TEDDY
(to Nick)
Penny-less pantywaist

Teddy leers between them and pulls Jordan away

TEDDY (CONT’D)
I’m stealing her away Carraway

Over wild applause the ORCHESTRA LEADER announces

ORCHESTRA LEADER
Ladies and gentlemen please make
your way to the grand terrazzo for
the premiere of Mr Vladimir
Tostoffs “A Jazz History of the
World” and accompanying fireworks

Nick follow Jordan but Teddy cuts him off--

TEDDY
Look around you Rich girls don’t
marry poor boys--

On cue a drinks tray floats into frame There is a flurry of
movement Teddy rudely snatches a couple of martinis

Nick disoriented and empty-handed begins up the stairs and
as he does so hears the voice of the man holding the tray

MAN
Your face is familiar Werent you
in the Third Division during the
war

NICK
Yes The Ninth Battalion

CUT TO THE MAN He is tanned and handsome just past thirty

MAN
I was in the Seventh I knew Id
seen you somewhere before Having
a good time old sport

NICK

(very tipsy)
The whole thing’s incredible - I
live next door

(brandishing his now

crumpled invitation)
He even sent me an invitation but
I still haven’t met Mr Gatsby no
one’s met him they say he’s third
cousin to the Kaiser and second
cousin to the devil

At the landing half way up the steps the man takes a drink
from a waiter’s tray and hands it to Nick
CLOSE ON

MAN
I’m afraid I’m not a very good
host old sport I’m Gatsby

Nick - his face drops

NICK
(muttering apologies)
Oh I’m very sorry-- I I’ve had
so much to drink

The delirious opening chords of Tostoff’s “History” coincide
with a gorgeous explosion of fireworks in the night sky

GATSBY
(apologetically)
I thought you knew old sport

Gatsby smiles a dazzling smile sound fades to a serene hum

NICK (VO)

His smile was one of those rare
smiles that you may come across
four or five times in life It
seemed to understand you and
believe in you just as you would
like to be understood and believed
in

All at once the bubble bursts a silver-haired fifty-ish man
in an immaculate tail-suit (HERZOG) leans into Gatsby

HERZOG
Excuse me sir Chicago on the wire

Gatsby nods but before he departs he smiles at Nick

GATSBY
I’m trying out my new hydroplane in
the morning Want to go with me
old sport

Nick shakes himself from his reverie

NICK
What time

GATSBY
Any time that suits you

Gatsby turns and catches for the first time Jordan

GATSBY (CONTD)
Lovely to see you Miss Baker

He kisses her lightly on the hand

GATSBY (CONTD)
(to Nick)
If you need anything just ask for
it old sport I will rejoin you
later Excuse me

As Nick watches Gatsby walk away he whispers with amazement

NICK
I expected him to be

JORDAN
Old and fat

NICK
Well yes young men don’t just
drift coolly out of nowhere and buy
a palace on Long Island

JORDAN
He told me once he was an Oxford
man However I dont believe it

NICK
Why not

JORDAN
I don’t know I just don’t
believe he went there

Jordan is interrupted by a voice

HERZOG
I beg your pardon

She and Nick jump to find Herzog suddenly beside them

HERZOG (CONTD)
Miss Baker Mr Gatsby would like

to speak to you Alone
JORDAN
(surprised)
Me
HERZOG

Yes madame

As Vladimir Tostoff’s erotic ominous chords build Jordan
crosses the now empty dance floor toward the silhouette of
Gatsby in the library window

Nick unsettled watches her go

Alarmingly drunk girls sprawl at the feet of the grand piano
Klipspringer plays a weeping woman attempts to slur along

the library door opens and Jordan emerges alone

Seeing Nick she rushes to him
JORDAN
Nick Nick Ive just heard the
most shocking thing it all makes

sense

Teddy and the other East Eggers accost Jordan

TEDDY
Where have you been The car’s
waiting
Jordan is dragged out the door Nick on tenterhooks

follows as Jordan calls back
JORDAN

Simply amazing It all makes sense

EXT GATSBY’S CASTLE - NIGHT

The night has devolved into drunken mayhem as cars jam the
driveway and intoxicated guests search for their vehicles

Nick chases Jordan down the marble stairs

NICK

The East Eggers and Jordan pile into their limousine Jordan
a mysterious smile as she leans out the window

JORDAN (CONTD)
And I swore I wouldn’t tell

NICK
But

JORDAN
Nick I’m sorry I swore I wouldn’t
tell

The car takes off and Nick is left staring mystified
A voice startles him
GATSBY
Sorry to keep her from you old
sport Dont forget were going up
in the hydroplane tomorrow morning

Herzog appears behind Gatsby

HERZOG
Philadelphia on the phone sir

Gatsby nods then smiles that intoxicating smile

GATSBY
Good night old sport

NICK
Good night Thank you

Gatsby nods warmly and turns inside

As Nick walks away he is confronted by a bizarre scene a big
crowd gathers around a COUPE resting on its side in a ditch

SUDDENLY Owl Eyes pops from the wreck He leers drunkenly

OWL EYES
Whazza matter We run outta gas

The beep of a horn catches Nick’s attention Jordan leaning
out of the window of her car as it sweeps away calls to him

JORDAN
Come and see me We’1l have tea
I’m in the phone-book

Nick waves smiles and cuts across the lawn

CLOSE ON Nick As he reaches the stone-pass separating his
yard from Gatsby’s he stops a familiar feeling

INT GATSBY’S CASTLE - TOWER - CONTINUOUS

High up in the window the shadowy figure of Gatsby stands
phone pressed to his ear watching Nick After a moment he
raises his hand in formal farewell

We rode in the hydroplane And I
attended two more of his parties
even made use of his beach But I
soon realized that I knew
absolutely nothing about Gatsby at

Gatsby yanks the wheel Nick hangs on for dear life

impression from all those bizarre
accusations you must be hearing A
pack of lies I assure you You’ve
heard the stories

NICK
Well--

GATSBY

I’1l1 tell you God’s truth God’s
truth about myself

(raises right hand)
I am the son of some very wealthy
people from the Middle-West sadly
all dead now I was brought up in
America but educated at Oxford
because all my ancestors have been
educated there for many years You
see it’s a a family tradition

As Gatsby’s speech continues at breakneck speed Nick’s
VO fades up

NICK (VO)
The way he spoke No wonder
people thought he was lying

GATSBY
After that I lived like a young
Prince in all the capitals of
Europe

NICK
Europe

Barrelling around a blind turn Gatsby wrenches at the wheel
and maniacally overtakes a truck laden with farmhands

GATSBY
Yes Europe Paris Venice Rome

He became a war hero single-
handedly defeating the German army

Gatsby He speaks with sudden subdued emotion

GATSBY
In the Argonne Forest I took my

forward We were outnumbered five

on either side of us where the
infantry couldn’t advance We
stayed there two days and two

mystified Nick rockets towards the Queensboro Bridge

One of your old Oxford pals

GATSBY
Well actually I was able to do
the Commissioner a favor once he
sends a Christmas card every year
(adds proudly)
I imagine he’1ll be at lunch too

NICK
By the time we reached the bridge I
was impossibly confused

Nick turns to see A Rolls Royce in which two stylish AFRICAN
AMERICAN MEN and a WOMAN haughtily quaff champagne They are
driven by a WHITE CHAUFFEUR

An orchestral melody surges

Bridge is always the city seen for
the first time in its first wild
promise of all the mystery and the
beauty in the world Anything can
happen now that weve slid over
this bridge I thought anything at
all

As the orchestra builds Gatsby’s car shoots into Manhattan
through Times Square and beneath the famous advertisement of
the man in the Arrow shirt We follow sweeping high over
skyscrapers The Duesenberg pulls up on the street below
SUDDENLY THE CAMERA PLUMMETS with startling velocity

breeding A war hero Such
medals And an Oggsford man

Jordan whirls round--

JORDAN
It’s no coincidence He bought that
house to be near her he threw all
those parties hoping she’d wander
in one night He constantly asked
about Daisy I was the first one

Nicky He’s a madman
More and more and more shirts float down
The rumble of distant thunder
CLOSE ON Daisy TIME SLOWS AS shirts flutter like giant
snowflakes down toward her Slowly quietly her mirth

transforms to sobs She hides her face in shirts

Gatsby eases down the stairs and nestles beside Daisy taking
her tear-streaked face in his hands

GATSBY
What is it

DAISY
It’s just It makes me sad
because

Daisy glances in Nick’s direction

GATSBY
Why

DAISY
-because

A suspended moment Daisy is incapable of speaking her heart

NICK (VO)

Five lost years struggled on
Daisy’s lips But all she could
Manage was

DAISY
It’s just Because Ive never
seen such beautiful shirts before

GATSBY
If it wasnt for the mist we could
see the green light

DAISY
What green light

GATSBY
The one that burns all night at the
end of your dock

As Gatsby and Daisy stare out across the bay

NICK (VO)

Possibly it had occurred to Gatsby
that the colossal significance of
that light had vanished forever
Now it was once again just a green
light on a dock His count of
enchanted objects had diminished by
one

Nick impelled to remind Daisy and Gatsby of his presence
emerges from the shadows and descends the spiral staircase

He holds a photo of an elderly man in yachting costume

NICK
Whos this Your father

GATSBY
No no That’s Mr Dan Cody old
sport Hes dead now He used to
be my best friend years ago

Daisy joins Nick at the bottom of the steps In the photo
with Cody also in yachting costume is a young Gatsby

You never told me you had a
pompadour or a yacht

I want to show you something
Look heres a lot of clippings
about you

They admire a scrapbook together

DAISY
(touched)
You saved my letters

GATSBY
This was my first photo of you

we hear her reading the letter in abstract VOICEOVER

this glorious love end in nothing
Come home I’1l be here waiting and
hoping for every long dream of you
to come true Come home Jay

Nobody from Nowhere make love to

you can count me out See
nowadays people begin by sneering
at family life and family
institutions and next you know
theyll throw everything overboard
and we’ll have intermarriage

damned if I see how you got within
a mile of her unless you brought

small investigation into your
affairs Youre one of Meyer
Wolfsheim’s bunch

Tom turns to the others and speaks rapidly

TOM (CONTD)
See he and this Wolfsheim bought
up a lot of drug stores and sold
bootlegged alcohol over the
counter

GATSBY
What about it old sport

TOM
Don’t call me ‘old sport’ This
drug store business is just small
change compared to the bonds stunt
you and Wolfsheim have got going on
now

GATSBY
Well your friend Walter Chase isn’t
too proud to come in on it

TOM
I’ve been giving that some thought
How does a reputable banker like
Walter Chase find himself up to his
eyeballs in debt to a little kike
like Wolfsheim

GATSBY
It’s called ‘greed’ old sport

TOM

That’s right you’ve got half of
Wall Street out there swilling your
free booze at that fun park every
weekend

I’m surprised he hasn’t tried to
drag you in

GATSBY
He’s got nothing to do with--

TOM

With your little racket

Daisy Can’t you see who this guy
is With his house and his parties
and his fancy clothes he’s just a
front for Wolfsheim a gangster to
get his claws into respectable folk
like Walter

The only respectable thing about
you old sport is your money
thats it and now I’ve just as
much as you so that means were

eyes stare into the void as with all his willpower he
restrains himself from ripping Tom apart

Gatsby looked in that moment as
if he had “killed a man”

Tom snorts a dismissive laugh

Gatsby recovers and turns to Diasy who is trembling in the
corner on the verge of tears

to have lost my temper

Struggling for self control Gatsby turns toward her as if
Tom suddenly no longer exists

desperate eyes look up at Tom

Fella named Gatsby he’s a crook
George Gives those parties the
papers are always talking about

situation in a few brisk phrases

TOM

sharply and walks off Dejected Jordan sweeps inside

EXT BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT

As Nick’s feet crunch upon the white gravel of the drive he
is startled by a voice from the shadows

GATSBY
Hello old sport

Cautiously Nick approaches the hedge The closer he gets the
more certain he becomes Gatsby is hiding just below Daisy’s
window His pace quickens

NICK
What are you doing
GATSBY
Just sitting here
NICK
Yes I can see that
GATSBY
Did you see any trouble out on the
road
NICK

Trouble That woman you ran down
is dead Jay

GATSBY
I thought so I told Daisy I

NICK
Daisy Do you hear yourself--

GATSBY

come all at once--

NICK
What’s wrong with you How could

GATSBY
Please Keep your voice down old

Panicked Gatsby grabs Nick trying to explain

tried-- to turn the wheel

NICK

SUDDENLY The CREAK of a door opening A shaft of light
Henri emerges

AN INTERMINABLE moment Gatsby and Nick hold their breaths
Finally Henri goes back in

CLOSE ON Nick a realization

NICK (CONTD)
It was Daisy

Finally and very slowly Gatsby admits

GATSBY
You see after we left New York
she was very nervous She thought
driving would steady her But this
woman she just rushed out at us

CUT TO We replay the violent accident this time fully
REVEALING that it was Daisy behind the wheel

GATSBY (CONTD)
It all happened so quickly It
wasn’t her fault

(MORE )

GATSBY (CONT’D)
It was my fault I should have
taken the wheel
(intense)
No one must know Promise me No

NICK
Jay-- You shouldn’t be here You
should get out of here

Gatsby gazes back to the house

GATSBY
No No No I’m going to wait I’1ll
wait all night if necessary You
see Daisy’s locked herself in her
room and she’s going to turn her
light off and on again if he tries
to bother her about that
unpleasantness this afternoon If
he tries ANY brutality whatsoever--

NICK
Tom wont touch her He’s not even
thinking about her

GATSBY
Oh I dont trust him old sport I
don’t trust him

Nick considers the light at the end of the terrace
NICK
Alright Alright You wait here
I’ll see if there’s any commotion
GATSBY

Would you do that for me Thank
you Thank you old sport

EXT BUCHANAN MANSION - TERRACE - NIGHT

Nick skirts the terrace

Rounding the corner Nick unseen in the shadows can see Tom
and Daisy sitting at one end of the vast dining table a

plate of cold chicken and two bottles of ale between them

As Tom speaks intently and earnestly at Daisy his hand falls
gently upon hers and she nods tiredly in agreement

TOM
Its going to be all right

Then very slowly Daisy lays her head on Tom’s shoulder

CLOSE ON Nick shocked angry

GATSBY
(as if Nick is crazy)
Go away I can’t leave now Not

NICK
Do you understand that a woman has
been killed--

Nick follows him from the garage toward the house

GATSBY
Daisy’s going to call in the
morning Then we’ll make plans to
go away together

NICK
But Jay she--

Sensing Nick’s tone Gatsby cuts him off and banishes all
doubt with intense certainty

GATSBY
She just needs time to think
(he continues calm)
She’1l call In the morning She
just needs time to think

NICK
Jay--

GATSBY
She just needs to think She’s
going to call in the morning

Gatsby smiles that smile of endless possibility
He turns to go in but stops

GATSBY (CONTD)
Wait up with me The suns almost
up

NICK (VO)
That was the night he finally told
me the truth All of it

DISSOLVE TO

INT GATSBY’S CASTLE - MAPROOM - NIGHT

Gatsby’s voice echoes through the empty halls of his vast
lonely mansion as he confesses

GATSBY
You know I thought for awhile I
had a lot of things But the
truth is I’m empty

(MORE)

GATSBY (CONTD)
I suppose that’s why I make things
up about myself But I’ve wanted
to tell you the whole story for a
long time You see I grew up
terribly terribly poor old sport
My folks were well--

As Gatbsy continues Nick’s VO FADES UP

NICK (V0O)
He revealed his humble beginnings
his transformative voyage with Dan
Cody the war Oxford and how he’d
joined Wolfsheim in the business

DISSOLVE TO

EXT GATSBY’S CASTLE - WHARF - PRE-DAWN

In the silvery pre-dawn Nick and Gatsby trail slowly toward
the end of the dock

NICK (VO)
It was also that night that I
became aware of Gatsby’s
extraordinary gift for hope

GATSBY
--I cant describe to you how
surprised I was to find out that I
loved her old sport And that she
loved me too

NICK (VO)
A gift that I have never found in
any other person

GATSBY
I never realized just how
extraordinary a nice girl could be

NICK (VO)
And which it is not likely I shall
ever find again

GATSBY
I thought out my life with Daisy in
it trying to figure out how we
could marry and struggle along on
so many dollars a month

Finally Nick is able to ask

NICK
What was in the letter

Gatsby reaches the end of the wharf and looks to the green
light across the bay

GATSBY

The truth the reason why after the
war I hadn’t been able to return--

In the clouds overhead the IMAGE OF DAISY in the bathtub
with the DISSOLVING LETTER And now we can see what Gatsby
wrote in that fateful last letter “Daisy the truth is
Im penniless”

GATSBY (0C) (CONT’D)
I asked her to wait until I’d made
something of myself But-- She was
young there was so much pressure

The IMAGE of Daisy fades

GATSBY (CONTD)
You see I felt married to her
That was all

NICK (VO)
It had all been for her The house
the parties everything

Just before he reaches the hedge he turns back and calls

NICK (CONT’D)

that warm summer night

NICK (VO)
He had come such a long way

And suddenly shimmering ghostly through the rain Gatsby’s
silhouette can be seen once more gazing out across the bay

And his dream must have seemed so
close that he could hardly fail to
grasp it

Gatsby turns back towards Nick and smiles

He did not know that it was already
behind him
