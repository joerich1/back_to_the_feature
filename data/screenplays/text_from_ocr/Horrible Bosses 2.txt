HORRIBLE BOSSES 2

by
Jonathan Goldstein

John Francis Daley
EXT HIGHWAY - MORNING

From overhead we see a Toyota Prius chugging along down the
highway

NICK (VO)

When you’re the president of the
98th largest financial services
company in America you need to
project a certain image An image
of boldness strength and
confidence

Suddenly a brand new shiny black Porsche Boxster
convertible ZOOMS around the Prius leaving it in the dust

As we move in we see the driver of the Porsche is NICK
HENDRICKS Sunglasses Top down Wind in his hair He
looks pretty cool

NICK (VO)
You’re not gonna get that image
driving a Prius

EXT COMNIDYNE PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Nick pulls into the lot and takes a reserved spot near the
entrance with a sign that reads “NICK HENDRICKS PRESIDENT”
He gets out of the Porsche and removes the dealer’s paper
floormat from under the pedals

NICK (VO)

I put in a lot of years to become
president of Comnindyne and now I’m
earning a lot more and working a
lot more The strange thing is
when I finally made it to the top
I realized that I’d actually only
made it to the bottom of the top

Nick heads toward the building passing several parking spots
with much more expensive sports cars (Ferrari Porsche 911
Turbo Mercedes SLR McLaren) each with a sign bearing a name
and the title “PRESIDENT”

NICK (VO)
Turns out Comnidyne has seven
presidents And I’m the most
junior

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Nick enters to find his more senior COLLEAGUES in their
morning meeting
NICK
Hey sorry I’m late
(holding up keys)
Had to stop by the dealership to
pick up a little something

The others all react impressed PETER 40’s squat gnome-
like heads to the window which looks down at the parking
lot

PETER
Well done Hendricks got himself
some big boy wheels
Another colleague ARTHUR 60’s joins them at the window
ARTHUR
(looking outside)
Which one is she
NICK
(pointing)
Right there She’s the Porsche

PETER
Barely You got a Boxster

NICK
Uh huh Two-thousand thirteen

A sallow-looking woman JEANINE 50’s chimes in

JEANINE
Cost you that much

The others all laugh derisively

NICK
It’s a great little car
PETER
That’s adorable You’re a great

little man
GLEN 50s hairpiece and jowls steps up
GLEN
I got my daughter a Boxster for her
Sweet 16 Made me take it back
Said it was “too girly”

They all laugh again Nick grits his teeth

NICK
Okay Maybe we should get to work
ARTHUR
You couldn’t at least spring for
the Carrera

NICK
Figured I’d go with the classic

PETER
Uh the Boxster was introduced
about forty years after the
Carrera So not exactly “a
classic”

JEANINE
(patting him on the
shoulder)
Don’t worry Nick Another ten
years here you’ll be able to
afford a real car

Nick stares at her

ARTHUR
All right guys Looks like the
Swiss are about to change their
drawdown regs so we need to talk
about a new home for our master
feeder fund

The presidents turn back to the piles of paperwork on the
table in front of them and resume their dreary work As they
talk the sound drops down and we PUSH IN on Nick as he
stares at his colleagues

NICK (VO)
You know what’s at the top of the
corporate ladder Another goddamn
ladder I may be a president but
I’m really just a fucking corporate
tool

FREEZE ON Nick’s forlorn expression as the words appear over
him

FUCKING

CORPORATE

TOOL

EXT BACKYARD POOL - DAY

We find KURT BUCKMAN sitting poolside on a chaise lounge
reading US Weekly and sipping a can of beer
KURT (VO)

Youre probably wondering “how
does this handsome bastard get to
sit by the pool with a beer ona
workday” Well here’s how you
quit your job find a sugar mama
whose rich husband is out of the
picture and let her take care of
you

He puts the magazine over his face and is about to take a
nap

WOMANS VOICE (0S)
Kurt Refill

Kurt sets the magazine aside and springs to his feet

INT HARKEN LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Kurt enters carrying three glasses of mojitos Sitting on
the couch is RHONDA HARKEN and her friends NIKKI late 30’s
a lot of work done and HEIDI early 40’s even more work

KURT (VO)
Does it bother me that my sugar
mama happens to be the ex-wife of
the man who tried to kill me and my
friends Meh

RHONDA
(to the girls)
She spends thousands on Botox She
should spend 50 cents on a razor
for that moustache

HEIDI
She looks like Tom Selleck with
fake boobs

The girls cackle Kurt quietly sets the glasses on the
coffee table and turns to go

RHONDA
Kurt Really

KURT
What

RHONDA

The table It’s African bubinga
wood I’ve told you Use a
coaster

KURT
Right Sorry
He puts a coaster under each glass

RHONDA
Thank you
(back to the girls)
Speaking of Erica have you seen
how fat her husband has gotten

NIKKI
Have you seen my tub of shit
lately He’s gained thirty pounds
since the holidays

HEIDI
(to Rhonda indicating
Kurt)
At least you got a good one

Kurt grins flattered

RHONDA
He’s okay

Kurt’s smile fades

RHONDA (CONTD)
Getting a little doughy in the
middle

NIKKI
I don’t believe it

RHONDA
It’s true
(to Kurt)
Pop that shirt off Show them

KURT
Huh
RHONDA
The shirt Pop it off
KURT
I’m not gonna--
RHONDA
(sternly)
Pop it
KURT

Rhonda I really don’t--

RHONDA
Pop It Off
Resigned Kurt takes his shirt off He’s in pretty good
shape

RHONDA (CONT’D)
Look at that

HEIDI
He looks all right to me

RHONDA
No look

She grabs what belly fat Kurt has pinching and jiggling it

KURT
Hey

RHONDA
How do we get rid of this Because
this is gross Here touch it

As the other women begin to poke and prod Kurt’s abdomen he
sighs heavily

KURT (VO)
I guess the only real downside of
this whole arrangement is that
sometimes I feel kinda I don’t
know bad about myself Like I’ve
turned into a ball-less little
bitch

FREEZE ON Kurt as the words appear over him

BALL-LESS
LITTLE
BITCH

EXT DALE’S HOUSE - DAY

DALE ARBUS opens the front door of his tiny house His VERY
pregnant wife STACY bids him goodbye Dale leans in to
kiss her but her enormous belly makes it hard to reach her
face

DALE (VO)
It’s all happening I got married
Stacy’s pregnant-- with triplets
And I finally got my sex offender
status expunged Which is great
because otherwise I’d have to stay
100 yards from my own kids

Dale crosses to his car and pulls out of the driveway
EXT DR SLOCUM’S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

Dale pulls into the parking lot passing a sign that reads
“DR HARLEN SLOCUM PEDIATRIC DENTIST” above an image of a
cartoon TOOTH having its own tooth pulled by another TOOTH
dressed as a dentist

DALE (VO)
I quit my dental assistant job and
got a new job As a dental
assistant But for a really sweet
man

INT DR SLOCUM’S OFFICE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Dale walks down a hallway passing framed photos of DR
SLOCUM in his dental scrubs at age 35 45 55 75
80-something

DALE (VO)
A really sweet really really old
man

INT WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Dale enters a world of CHAOS populated by screaming KIDS and
a handful of exhausted PARENTS Toys lie strewn everywhere
A group of TODDLERS tear the upholstery out of a sofa
cushion A RECEPTIONIST sits at a desk oblivious

Dale takes a step and TRIPS over something off-camera He
looks down and picks up the CRYING INFANT he stumbled on

DALE
Okay whose baby is this You
can’t just leave your babies on the
floor

A harried MOTHER takes the baby from him as he carefully
picks his way across the kid-covered floor

INT EXAMINATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Dale enters to find a 4 YEAR-OLD BOY GABE hollering
miserably as DR SLOCUM 80’s sits slumped asleep with

dental tools still inside Gabe’s open mouth

DALE
Not again

Dale hurries over and nudges the dentist awake
DALE (CONTD)
Dr Slocum Wake up You’re with
a patient

DR SLOCUM

(groggy)
What I know What

Dale gently removes the tools from Gabe’s mouth Gabe stops
yelling

DALE
(to Gabe)
Youre okay buddy
(checking)
Nothing bleeding here

GABE
I have to pee

DALE
Okay Bathroom’s down the hall

GABE
Someone has to take me

DALE
Where’s your mommy

GABE
She’s at Target

DALE
Oh Okay I’1ll take you

DR SLOCUM
Hang on I’ve got to check his
lower left cuspid

DALE
He’s gotta go to the bathroom

DR SLOCUM

Dale escorts the boy out

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Dale leads Gabe to the bathroom door

DALE
Okay Here you go
GABE

DALE
Help you What do you mean
GABE

DALE
I don’t think that’s a great idea
Gabe
GABE

Please I have to go
Dale looks around furtively

DALE
Okay come on
(hustling him inside)
Quick quick come on

INT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Dale and Gabe enter Dale locks the door behind them and
starts uncomfortably undoing Gabe’s pants

DALE

(mumbling)
It’s just that I recently had
something expunged from my record
It was a big misunderstanding
Empty playground No kids
anywhere But I really shouldn’t
be doing this

He gets the pants open and heads for the door
DALE (CONTD)

Okay You’re good to go I’1l
wait outside

GABE
No You have to aim for me
DALE
What No one’s taught you how to

aim
Gabe shakes his head
DALE (CONTD)

What kind of parenting-- Is your
mom always at Target

GABE
I’m gonna go in my pants

DALE
I’m gonna go to jail

Gabe does a desperate pee pee dance

GABE
Please It hurts

DALE
Aw man You’re really gonna make
me do this
(sighs )
All right Let’s get it over with

Dale takes a latex glove from his dental scrubs and pulls it
on his hand With his arm outstretched and looking the other
way he helps Gabe aim (off-screen) We hear the sound of
peeing

DALE (CONTD)
There you go
(to himself)
This is not a good situation

INT HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

A mortified Dale leads Gabe back to the exam room Dale
peels off his glove and tosses it in a bin

DALE
Feel better

GABE
Yes Thank you

DALE
You’re welcome

(beat)
Now you don’t necessarily have to
tell your mom that I helped you
pee It can be our secret
(quickly)
Not a secret Just a fun thing
that we never tell anyone else
(quickly)
Not a fun thing Just a secret

INT DR SLOCUM’S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

Dale peers through the blinds and sees Gabe getting in a car
with his MOTHER

The car pulls out of its parking spot and drives forward
fifty feet or so then SCREECHES to a halt SLAMS into
reverse and ZOOMS back into the parking lot

Dale looks like he’s going to puke as Gabe’s mother exits the
car and marches toward the building

DALE
Oh shit oh shit oh shit

He hurries to the waiting room to head her off

INT WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Dale bursts through the door to find Gabe’s mother walking up
to the receptionist

DALE
Let me expl--

GABE’S MOTHER

(to Receptionist)
I completely forgot to schedule
Gabe’s next appointment

Dale lets out an enormous sigh of relief

DALE (VO)
I guess if I’m being honest this
job stresses the crap out of me
I’m not so much a dental assistant
as a goddamn babysitter

We FREEZE on Dale’s face as the words appear

GOD
DAMN
BABYSITTER

INT UPSCALE HOTEL BAR - THAT NIGHT

Nick Kurt and Dale sit at a table with drinks Like Nick
most of the PATRONS wear business attire Many are older A
PIANIST plays soft jazz in one corner

KURT
(to Dale)
What’s the deal with you and little
kids’ dicks

DALE
There weren’t “dicks” It was just
one You make it sound like it was
a boys choir

NICK
I don’t know Dale I’m starting
to see a pattern here I mean if
I had been on the sex offender
registry Id try and avoid
handling kids’ private parts

KURT
(to Dale)
I don’t think I can be friends with
you anymore

NICK
Yeah feels like two strikes is
enough

DALE

What was I supposed to do Let the
kid piss in his pants

KURTNICK
YeahUh huh

DALE
You guys don’t get it You’re not
fathers-to-be You don’t have the
instinct to protect children

KURT
I have the instinct to protect them
from people like you

DALE
Very funny

NICK
How’s Stacy feeling

DALE
Pregnant Very pregnant I don’t
think the human body is designed to
carry three babies

KURT

Are you grossed out by her body
DALE

No Of course not It’s

beautiful

(off their looks)
It’s a little gross She’s got
this weird line that runs down her
belly

KURT
Yeesh Not worth it I say

A WAITER sets down a fresh dish of olives removing the old
dish full of pits Dale eagerly begins eating the new ones

NICK
Dale that’s your fourth bowl of
olives

DALE

I like olives

NICK
Just because they keep bringing
them doesn’t mean you have to keep
wolfing them down

DALE
But I like ‘em

KURT
(to Nick)
What do you care

NICK
It’s embarrassing This is a
classy place

KURT
It’s a bullshit place I don’t
know why you drag us here all the

time

DALE
Yeah what was wrong with our old
bar

NICK

This is much nicer

KURT
Hotel bars suck The beer costs
ten bucks and the women are either
old or hookers I can’t afford

DALE
And that bathroom attendant expects
me to pay him for paper towels so
I can’t even wash my hands

Kurt and Nick grimace as Dale roots through the olive dish

KURT
(to Nick)
I know why you like this place
Youre a fancypants

NICK
What

KURT
Admit it Since you became
president you’ve gotten all fancy

NICK
I’m not a fancypants

KURT
Dale

DALE
(to Nick)
Youre a little fancy

NICK
Fuck you guys

KURT
Hey hey That’s not a very fancy
thing to say

(then)

It’s just that lately you seem to
care a lot more about where you
drink what you wear what kind of
car you drive--

DALE
How many olives I eat

NICK
Look when you get to my position
people expect certain things of
you

KURT
But you’re the boss Doesn’t that
mean you don’t have to care what
people think of you anymore

NICK
It’s more complicated than that
KURT
Hey as long as it’s making you
happy
NICK
Yeah

We stay on NICK It’s pretty clear that he is not happy

From the hallway outside the bar they suddenly hear MUSIC
blaring over a loudspeaker It’s “I GOTTA FEELING” by The
Black Eyed Peas accompanied by CHEERING from what sounds
like a decent-sized crowd

DALE
What’s going on out there

They exchange a curious look

INT HOTEL BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Nick Kurt and Dale open the door find a motivational seminar
in progress An audience of around 100 PEOPLE sit in rows of
seats as the music BOOMS from a PA On a riser at the front

of the room an energetic 40-something man claps along to the
song

NICK
Who is that

DALE
You don’t know who that is That’s
Denny Paul

KURT
How do you know him

DALE
From his sign

Dale points behind them to a sign featuring a headshot of
DENNY PAUL beneath the title “YOU DA BOSS”

Denny picks up a mic as the music fades out
DENNY
Am I the only one who has a feeling
that tonight is gonna be a good
good night

KURT
Let’s go

Nick and Kurt start to go

DALE
Wait Let’s see what Denny has to
say

DENNY

Show of hands Who here had a
vision when they were younger of
where they wanted their life to go

Most of the crowd raises their hands

DENNY (CONTD)
Okay Now how many of you are
living that vision Who here is
living their “vision life”
Only a few hands go up Denny “scans” the crowd

DENNY (CONTD)
Hmm I don’t see any hands Oh
wait here’s one Boom

He puts up his own hand and points at it

DENNY (CONTD)
That’s right This guy with his
hand up You know who he is
He’s me Just little old me
Living my vision life Wanna know
how I did it

NICK KURT
Nope Don’t care

DENNY (CONTD)
I grabbed the reins of the horse
that was my life and I slapped that
horses ass and I made it ride
where I wanted it to ride Not
down some shitty path that the
horse wanted to ride Because
horses are idiots

DALE
He’s not wrong

DENNY
Here’s the deal gang the only
people who are truly happy in this
crazy world are the ones who don’t
have to answer to anybody They’re
their own boss They control their
destiny

ANGLE ON Nick and Kurt who are actually listening now

DENNY (CONTD)
See I used to be just like you A
drone No self-respect Working
for the man Then I realized I am
the man I quit my job left my
loveless marriage and started my
own business helping other
people start their own business
And here’s the kicker folks Last
year I made in the very high five
figures Guess what Vision life
Lovin’ it

Denny drops the mic to the floor The crowd applauds
appreciatively After a moment Denny picks up the mic
again

DENNY (CONTD)
So let’s get into the fifteen
steps Step one take a good look
at yourself in the mirror or any
reflective surface a shiny pan a
still puddle--

A HOTEL EMPLOYEE approaches the guys
HOTEL EMPLOYEE
Excuse me gentlemen can I see
your tickets please
Nick Kurt and Dale all shake their heads and wander out of
the ballroom

INT UPSCALE HOTEL BAR - LATER

The guys are back in the bar

DALE
All I’m saying is Denny Paul has a
point I thought that when I went
to work for Dr Slocum Id be
happier But my job still kinda
sucks

NICK
I hear you Dale I’m not exactly
living the dream either

KURT
Seriously Have you learned
nothing You want to kill your
bosses again

DALE
What No I just mean maybe the
problem wasn’t working for our old
bosses Maybe the problem is
working for anyone

KURT
I don’t work for anyone
NICK
You kinda do
DALE
(to Kurt)
Mrs Harken treats you like a
slave
KURT

You don’t have sex with a slave

NICK
Thomas Jefferson did

DALE
(noticing)
Hey look

ANGLE ON Denny Paul drinking a whisky at the bar

DALE (CONTD)
It’s Denny Paul
(calling to him)
Denny Mr Paul
(Denny looks over)
Can we buy you a drink

Nick and Kurt grimace Denny shrugs downs his drink
signals the bartender for another one and ambles over to
them He looks fairly drunk

KURT
What are you doing
DALE
Buying him a drink
NICK
Doesn’t really look like he needs
one
DENNY

(a bit slurred)
What’s up guys

DALE
We really enjoyed your seminar--

KURT
We snuck in

NICK
And we left after five minutes

DENNY
Candor alert Look out

The Waiter sets down Denny’s drink He downs it in one gulp
and gestures for another

KURT
(sotto to Nick)
Alcoholic alert

NICK
Look out

DALE
I’m Dale This is Nick and Kurt
We were just talking about how
great it would be to be our own
bosses

DENNY
If talking was doing a telephone
would be a hammer

NICK
Not sure I get that

KURT
That’s only because it makes no
sense

DALE
How did you do it Denny Did you
follow your own fifteen steps

Denny looks at them and considers for a beat

DENNY
Buy me another drink

Dale signals the waiter

DENNY (CONTD)
(leaning in)
You wanna know a secret The
fifteen steps are bullshit

NICK
No

KURT
Get out of town

DENNY
Yeah I just made ‘em up People
love steps And they love being
told what to do

DALE

So what do we do Tell us
DENNY

You want to know how I started my

business

He fumbles for his wallet taking it out and handing them a
business card

NICK
(reading)
International Venture Partners

DENNY
Bingo Venture capital These
guys set me up with enough cash to
get “You Da Boss” off the ground

KURT
What’s the catch

DENNY
No catch They take a 10 percent
ownership stake They make money
when you make money You just
gotta have a good enough idea

NICK
And “You Da Boss” was a good enough
idea

DENNY

Did you see that crowd tonight
I’m a very charismatic guy

Denny notices a WOMAN in a pencil skirt walk past

DENNY (CONT’D)
Excuse me Are you a prostitute

The guys look horrified

WOMAN
(after a beat)
Yes

DENNY
(getting up)
All right guys Good luck with
whatever we were talking about

He stumbles off with the prostitute Kurt and Nick watch him
go incredulous Dale stares at the business card

DALE
Hmm A lot to think about
INT HARKEN’S HOUSE - LATER
Nick Kurt and Dale enter from the front door
KURT
Keep your voices down I don’t

want to wake her

DALE
It’s past your curfew isn’t it

KURT
You want to get smacked

DALE
(quietly)
No

They head into the living room
NICK
(looking around nervously)
Does she still have that cat

KURT
No He ran away months ago

NICK
Good

Relieved Nick sits on the sofa As he does a CAT leaps
onto his shoulder from behind with a YOWL and darts away

NICK (CONTD)
What the hell You said he ran
away

KURT
That’s the new cat

NICK
What does she rescue them from a
haunted house

Kurt pours drinks from a wet bar and they all sit Dale sets
his drink on the table

KURT
Dale Use a coaster That’s
bubinga wood

NICK
(to Kurt)
Who are you

DALE
(holding up business card)
I think we should seriously
consider this venture capital
thing

NICK
They don’t just hand you money
Dale You need to pitch them a
good business idea

KURT
Like an invention

NICK
Could be

KURT
I’ve got a ton of ideas for
inventions

NICK
(dubious)
Do you

KURT
You know how your dick sticks to
your balls when it’s hot out

NICK
Um

KURT
Picture this underwear with
compartments that separate your
dick from your balls

NICK
No one’s gonna fund that

KURT
When it’s hot out they will
Well just pitch it on a hot day

DALE
That’s a stupid idea
(beat)
It should be a non-stick spray for
your balls like Pam

NICK
Much better

KURT
Wait wait I got one Regular
sized condoms that are packaged in
Magnum condom wrappers So the
girl you’re with thinks you’ve got
a big dick

DALE
Ooh that just gave me an idea A
condom in a spray can It goes on
as a liquid and then it hardens
into a solid

KURT
Youre just taking my ideas and
putting them in spray cans
(then)
(MORE )
KURT (CONTD)
And how are you supposed to remove
the rubber after it’s fused onto
your penis

DALE
It’ll come with an antidote spray
Some kind of acid That’s for our
lab guys to figure out

NICK
(to Dale and Kurt)
Why do all of your inventions have
to do with dicks and balls

KURT
I don’t know Why were all of the
Wright Brothers’ ideas about
planes

DALE
Maybe Nick’s right Maybe we need
to focus more on vagina inventions

KURT
No the key to a good invention is
that it solves some everyday
problem

They sit there and think for a minute

DALE
Okay here’s an everyday problem
showering You gotta shampoo
condition lather up rinse
repeat It takes forever

There’s a beat

KURT
So what’s the invention

DALE
I don’t know I thought we were
just talking about problems

NICK
I think I’m gonna go to bed

KURT
One sec Dummy may be onto
something It does seem like
showering is pretty inefficient

DALE
Right I bet the average person
loses a day every week just
showering

NICK
(re Dale’s math)
Feels wrong

KURT
What if there was some kind of a
showerhead that you fill with soap
shampoo and conditioner and it
mixes it with the water

DALE
Yeah You could turn a dial to
choose what you want it to spray
Like those Miracle-Gro things you
attach to a garden hose

KURT
Right

They turn to Nick for his reaction

NICK
It’s not terrible But I’m sure
it already exists

CUT TO

INT HARKEN KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

The guys stand around a laptop computer On the screen is
Google search for “showerhead with built-in soap”

KURT
Not finding it

DALE
Try Bed Bath and Beyond They’ve
got everything

Kurt does

KURT
Nope

DALE
So should we call that venture
capital guy

NICK
It’s 2 in the morning Dale And
you don’t have a prototype or even
a name for this thing

DALE
How about the Shower Buddy
KURT
That sounds like a gay friend who
soaps up your back in the shower

DALE
I don’t know why you go right to
“gay”
(types on laptop)
Let’s see what comes up under
“Shower Buddy”

They all cringe and recoil at what appears on screen
DALE (CONTD)
Okay that’s pretty gay But it’s
not a product

NICK
It’s more of a position

Rhonda enters in a bathrobe

RHONDA
What’s going on in here

Kurt hastily slams the laptop shut on Dale’s hand

DALE
Ow

KURT
Just hanging out with the guys
hon

RHONDA

Do you know what time it is Some
of us have to work in the morning

KURT
(under his breath)
You don’t work

RHONDA
I’ve got yoga at ten And I don’t
appreciate the attitude It’s time
to say goodnight to your friends

KURT
But--

She shuts him down with a look
KURT (CONTD)

(to Nick and Kurt)
You guys better go

DALE
What about our Shower Buddy

Rhonda looks confused Kurt herds Nick and Dale toward the
door

NICK
Forget it Dale It’s silly

DALE
I don’t think it’s silly I think
it could be the key to our vision
life

NICK
Goodnight Kurt Rhonda

Nick and Dale exit Rhonda heads for the stairs
RHONDA
Let’s go Upstairs My pussy’s
not going to eat itself

Kurt sighs then slumps out after her

MUSIC CUE “Modern Man” by Arcade Fire

EXT COMNIDYNE PARKING LOT - NEXT DAY

Nick walks to his Boxster and stops abruptly when he sees a
BUMPER STICKER has been stuck to his rear bumper that reads

“My Other Car is a Porsche”

Nick tries to peel it off but only part of the top layer
comes off Pissed he looks around and notices his fellow
PRESIDENTS watching from a window and laughing their asses
off at him

INT SUPERMARKET - DAY

Kurt stands at the checkout counter as a CUTE FEMALE CASHIER
rings up his purchases He gives her a flirty smile which
she returns until she sees what he’s buying Secret
deodorant Oil of Olay and an enormous value pack of
tampons

He hands her a credit card INSERT the card it belong to
Rhonda Harken and has her photo on it

The cashier looks at him dubiously Kurt shrugs sheepishly

INT DR SLOCUM’S EXAM ROOM - DAY

Dale sits on his stool making detailed yet crudely drawn
sketches on a steno pad of the proposed “Shower Buddy”
device He smiles pleased then looks up to see Dr Slocum
has fallen asleep and the dental chair is empty

He looks around frantically and gasps when he spots the
PATIENT a five year-old girl who has climbed halfway out
the window Dale hurries over to rescue her

EXT OFFICE BUILDING - LATER

Dale’s car pulls up to a sleek modern building

INT DALE’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Dale wears a slightly tattered business suit He takes out
of his pocket the International Venture Partners card that
Denny Paul gave them and double checks the address

INT MR NAGOPIAN’S OFFICE - LATER

Dale sits on a couch in a well-appointed office and finishes
his pitch to someone offscreen Beside him stands an easel
with his Shower Buddy sketch tacked to it

DALE
The Shower Buddy eliminates the
endless cycle of washing and
rinsing and washing and rinsing
It’s not just a time saver It’sa
life saver My team is ready to
move on this with or without your
help But the only way we can do
that is with your help

REVERSE ON ALEX NAGOPIAN 40’s well dressed confident and
slightly intimidating (think Liam Neeson) Beside him sits
JOYCE 30’s an attractive colleague Nagopian considers
Dale’s pitch for a beat

MR NAGOPIAN
Youre a funny little man Dale

DALE
Go on

MR NAGOPIAN
As far as your idea this “Shower
Buddy”
(beat)
I love it

DALE
Seriously

MR NAGOPIAN
Yes It’s smart it fills a niche
What do you think Joyce

JOYCE
Sounds like the kind of product we
like to fund

MR NAGOPIAN
Of course our due diligence people
will have to make sure no one else
has done it

DALE
Well we googled it and didn’t find
anything

MR NAGOPIAN
I see And why aren’t your
partners here with you

DALE
They’re very busy men We all are
Very busy Men

MR NAGOPIAN
But you have power of attorney to
sign on their behalf

Dale stares at him for a beat

DALE
yes
(then)
Does this mean we’re in business

MR NAGOPIAN
That depends How much do you need
to get the Shower Buddy off the
ground

DALE
Do you have a piece of paper

MR NAGOPIAN
Why

DALE
So I can write down the amount and
slide it across the table to you

Nagopian looks mildly annoyed He nods to Joyce who tears a
piece of paper off a pad and hands it to Dale

DALE (CONTD)
Great Thanks I’ve always wanted
to do this

Dale scribbles on the paper and slides it across the coffee
table Nagopian looks at it

MR NAGOPIAN
I can’t read this Is this a 2

JOYCE
(leaning in)
Looks like a “G”

DALE
No that’s a “9”

MR NAGOPIAN
Then I don’t understand this
number You have two commas next
to each other

DALE
No no that’s not a comma That’s
also a nine-- you know what Let

me write it again--

MR NAGOPIAN
Why don’t you just say the number

DALE
(tentatively)
Nine hundred ninety-nine thousand
nine-hundred ninety nine dollars

MR NAGOPIAN
Why not an even million

DALE
It sounds like less

MR NAGOPIAN
This isn’t the Radio Shack A
million is fine

DALE
(floored)
Fuck me
(then covering)
Wonderful

MR NAGOPIAN
Joyce here will bring you to our
legal department to sign the
necessary paperwork

Nagopian stands and shakes Dale’s hand

MR NAGOPIAN (CONTD)
Congratulations Dale We look
forward to a long and profitable
relationship with you and your
Shower Buddy

(beat)
That name Is it a little gay

DALE
Nope

MR NAGOPIAN
Fair enough

INT OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

Dale sits at a desk in another room as Joyce places a large
stack of documents in front of him

JOYCE
All you have to do is sign on the
last page for you and your
partners

DALE
Not so fast If there’s one thing
I know about business you never
sign anything without reading it
carefully

JOYCE
Take your time

She sits down as Dale begins to read the first page

SMASH CUT TO

INT OFFICE - TWO MINUTES LATER

Two pages into the stack Dale is BORED OUT OF HIS MIND and
fighting to stay awake

DALE
Okay this all looks good

He flips to the last page and in an INSERT we see him sign
first his own name then forge the signatures of “Nick
Hendricks” and “Kurt Buckman”

EXT BURGER JOINT - DAY

Nick dressed for work joins Dale still in his suit and
Kurt at an outdoor table

NICK
I have fifteen minutes Dale I
never do lunch outside the office
What’s going on

KURT
He wouldn’t tell me anything till
you got here

DALE
This isn’t something I could tell
you over the phone

NICK
Why are you wearing your church
clothes

Kurt and Nick exchange a grave look

KURT
Is it your unborn babies

NICK
Oh Dale I’m so sorry Hows
Stacy doing

DALE
She’s fine The babies are fine
Jesus

KURT
Well why did you scare us like
that

DALE

I didn’t scare anybody You’re
scaring me

NICK
So you dragged us out here to tell
us your babies are fine

DALE
No This has nothing to do with my
babies You’re ruining this

KURT
Ruining what

DALE
This

He pulls a check from his jacket pocket and gingerly holds it
up for them to see

INSERT CHECK in the amount of ONE MILLION DOLLARS made out to
Nick Hendricks Kurt Buckman and Dale Arbus

NICK
What-- what are we looking at here
Dale

KURT

Is that one of those Publishers
Clearinghouse checks

DALE

No It’s a real check From the
venture capital place Denny Paul

used I pitched them the Shower

Buddy and they loved it

KURT
They loved the Shower Buddy

DALE
They said it filled a niche

NICK
Let me see that

He grabs the check and examines it
KURT
Why would you do this without
telling us
DALE
Because I knew you didn’t believe
in the Buddy like I did
Nick gets up

NICK
Come on

DALE
Where are you going

Nick points across the street at a bank
NICK
I’m gonna see if this thing is
real

Dale scurries after him Kurt grabs his burger and follows

INT BANK - MINUTES LATER

Nick Kurt and Dale huddle around the window of a BANK TELLER
who types the check information into her computer After a
beat
BANK TELLER
Would you like this deposited to
separate or joint accounts

NICK
So it’s real

BANK TELLER
Um yes it is

KURT

Fuck me
DALE

Told you
NICK
(to Teller)

Can I have that back please

Nick takes the check and the three move away

NICK (CONTD)
(to Dale)
You need to return this

DALE
What

KURT
Whoa whoa Hang on

NICK
No one hands you a million dollars
without there being a catch This
is too good to be true

KURT
What if it’s too good to be not
true Shouldn’t we at least
consider it

NICK
(checks watch)
I’m going to be late for work

He turns to go but Kurt stops him

KURT
So what So you’re late for work
Youre late for being miserable

NICK
I’m sorry

KURT
You hate working at that place
Youve always hated it Why keep
doing something that makes you
unhappy

DALE
Yeah Nick This could be a whole
new start

NICK
If I quit the ten years of hard
work I put in at Comndiyne will
have been for nothing

KURT
It was always for nothing What do
you think is going to happen on
your death bed Mr Comnidyne’s
gonna come in thank you for giving
up your entire life and escort you
to corporate heaven

NICK
There is no Mr Comnidyne

KURT
No shit People who work at those
places do it because they’re too
afraid to do something better

DALE
Touché

NICK
This coming from the guy who lives
with a woman who treats him like a
sex butler

DALE
Touché
NICK KURT
(to Dale) (to Dale)
Stop it Shut up
KURT
(to Nick)

You know what You’re right I’m
gonna leave Rhonda Dale and I
have a business to start

DALE
That’s what’s up

He high-fives Kurt
KURT
Come on Nick
(holding up the million
dollar check)
Life doesn’t give you a lot of
opportunities like this But do
what you gotta do

Off Nick’s ambivalence

INT COMNIDYNE CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

Having returned to work Nick joins his colleagues for
another board meeting

PETER
Hey where’s Arthur

JEANINE
You didn’t hear He had another
heart attack this morning

PETER
Is he okay

GLEN

It’s his third I’m sure he’s used
to them by now

They chuckle

PETER
Should we send him something

JEANINE

What do you get the guy who has
everything wrong with his heart

Everyone but Nick laughs again
GLEN
Let’s get him something small and
cheap

PETER
How about Nick’s Boxster

They laugh

NICK
I quit

They all look at him for a beat Is he joking

JEANINE
What

NICK
Yeah I can’t do this anymore

He starts to gather his things in his briefcase

NICK (CONT’D)
With all due respect guys I just
don’t respect any of you And I
really don’t want to turn into you

He suddenly stops loading his case

NICK (CONTD)
What am I doing I don’t need any
of this I’ve got my Shower Buddy
now See ya

He dumps the files out shuts his case and exits There’s a
stunned silence then

GLEN
“Shower buddy”

JEANINE
Did he just come out of the closet

PETER
That explains the Boxster

INT DR SLOCUM’S OFFICE - SAME TIME
Dale sits across a desk from Dr Slocum

DALE
it’s nothing personal You’re a
very nice man and I appreciate you
hiring me but it’s time for me to
take another direction with my
career Now I realize you’re fast
asleep

REVERSE ANGLE to reveal Slocum is in fact fast asleep at
his desk

DALE (CONTD)
-but I wanted to tell you in
person anyway So
(getting up)
guess I’m just gonna go

He quietly opens the door to the office but it stops
halfway banging into something in the hall

SFX BABY CRYING

Dale reaches down and picks up another unhappy BABY

DALE (CONT’D)
(calling out to the
waiting room)
What did I say about leaving babies
on the floor

EXT BACKYARD POOL - SAME TIME
Rhonda Nikki and Heidi lounge by the pool

RHONDA
So I had to fire Monica

NIKKI
I thought you liked her

RHONDA
I did But I saw “The Help” and it
just felt racist to have a black

cleaning lady

From inside we hear the sound of something being dragged
across the floor

RHONDA (CONTD)
Do you know any white cleaning

ladies

HEIDI
Wait you’re firing your black
cleaning lady and replacing her
with a white one because you don’t
want to feel racist

RHONDA
(matter of fact)
Uh huh

The dragging sound gets louder and the women look up to see
the BUBINGA WOOD COFFEE TABLE emerge from the house being
shoved outside by Kurt

RHONDA (CONT’D)
What the hell Kurt what are you

doing
KURT
(grunting from effort)
I thought of a great spot for this
bubinga wood table

He gives the table a final push RIGHT INTO THE POOL The
water splashes Rhonda and her friends who gasp in disbelief

RHONDA
Are you insane

KURT
That’s right I’m sorry I forgot
the coaster

He takes a coaster from his pocket and tosses it into the
pool

KURT (CONTD)
(nodding to Nikki and
Heidi)
Ladies
And with that Kurt turns smiles and goes

INT CONSUMER PRODUCTS TESTING LAB - DAY

The three guys stand with a LAB TECH observing a male TEST
SUBJECT in a bathing suit trying out prototypes of the Shower
Buddy in a glass shower stall

QUICK SERIES OF POPS as the prototypes malfunction

-- The pressure builds up in the shower head and bursts in
the subject’s face

-- The subject now a bit more nervous turns on the water
and nothing but soap oozes from the shower head

-- The shower head sprays the perfect combination of water
and soap Our guys look pleased until the shower head
inexplicably stops spraying The subject cautiously inspects
the device and suddenly the shower head bursts in his face
again

-- Our guys follow the bruised and pissed off subject to his
car apologizing profusely They manage to convince him to
go back into the building

-- Fearing for his life the same subject gingerly turns on
the shower which has a new model Shower Buddy installed

This time it actually works as it should Nick and Kurt high-
five In the test chamber we see Dale yank open the shower
stall and hug the subject

EXT GOLF COURSE - DAY

The guys smoke cigars as they cruise down the fairway in a
golf cart enjoying a mid-week outing

In QUICK POPS we see Nick Kurt and Dale each tee off

Then three more QUICK POPS as each tries to recover their
ball still smoking their cigars

Nick uses his club to try and knock his ball down from a tree
where it’s wedged

Nick and Dale hold onto Kurt’s belt as he leans over a pond
searching for his ball

Dale knocks on the door of a house A pissed off GUY opens
the door and hands him his golf ball WIDEN to reveal a golf

sheepishly takes the ball and hurries away

EXT DALE’S HOUSE - DAY

Covering Stacy’s eyes Dale leads her outside to surprise her
with a brand new minivan wrapped in a bow in the driveway

their hair white linen pants etc Suddenly they are
violently jolted to the side

PULL BACK to show their boat is in the harbor and has DRIFTED
sideways into another docked sailboat Their sails are in
disarray-- clearly none of them knows the first thing about
sailing Panicked Dale begins winching a line which only
TEARS the mainsail down the middle Kurt and Nick step onto
the dock and head off leaving Dale to deal with the mess

END OF MONTAGE

INT NICKURDALE CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

The guys sit with GREG and NANCY the handsome guy and middle-
aged woman they interviewed earlier
NICK
Nancy how we doing on our
production quota

NANCY
Solid We’ve got five thousand
units in inventory

NICK
Good Greg how are things on the
marketing front

GREG
I’m talking to my contacts at QVC
HSN and Amazon There’s a lot of
interest

NICK
Nice Dale can I get a refill

Nick holds up his empty coffee mug

DALE
You bet

Dale crosses to a coffee pot and refills Nick’s cup

NICK
Kurt how are sales

KURT
Well we haven’t sold a single unit
yet so sales are non-existent

But here’s the thing it takes time
to build awareness The only thing
standing between us and a multi-
million dollar success story is one
giant distributor Like say
SkyMall

Kurt slaps a SkyMall catalogue down on the table

KURT (CONTD)

Maybe you’ve heard of it Reaches
six hundred fifty million airline
passengers a year

NICK
Yeah So Did you call them or
something

KURT

Nope They called us They’re
interested in the Shower Buddy and
want to meet with us later today
about putting it in their fall
catalogue

DALE
Booyah

NICK
That’s great news

KURT
It’s better than great Skymall
made household names out of the
Marshmallow Shooter the Old Time
Popcorn Cart the Pet Ramp They
put the “world’s largest wall map”
on the map

DALE
Stacy and I got one of those Pet
Ramps for Darvis when he couldn’t
jump onto the bed anymore

KURT
That dog reeks of shit You let
him in your bed

DALE
Of course We love Darvis

KURT
If you love him why don’t you give
him a bath once in a while

DALE
Dogs don’t need baths They’re
self-cleaning

KURT
That’s cats

DALE
Ugh I hate the smell of cats

ANGLE ON Greg and Nancy who exchange a look that says “Who
the hell are we working for”

NICK

(to Greg and Nancy)
Sorry

(then)
If the Skymall people are coming
weve got to get ready for that
pitch I’11 work up a
presentation Kurt why don’t you
set up the demo in here Dale
we’re gonna need a lot more coffee

DALE
I’m on it

We follow Nick as he heads out into

INT NICKURDALE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Nick crosses a second floor walkway that overlooks the modest
assembly line below He passes an UNDERLING

NICK
Hey Tim Did you get that
shipment in yet

TIM
Yep A bunch of pens and stress
reliever balls with the company
name on it

NICK
Perfect Keep up the good work

Nick heads into an office with a sign on the door that reads

“NICK HENDRICKS CO-CEO”

INT NICK’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Nick crosses to his desk but before he gets there he’s
startled by a voice

MANS VOICE (0S)
Nice suit

Nick whirls around to see Mr Nagopian sitting on the sofa
Off to the side stands a LARGE MAN in a suit

MR NAGOPIAN
You’re much better dressed than
your “co-CEO” Dale

NICK
Thank you And you are

MR NAGOPIAN
Alex Nagopian International
Venture Partners
He stands and shakes Nick’s hand
NICK
Oh Right It’s nice to finally
meet you
Nick nods at the big guy in the corner

MR NAGOPIAN
This is my associate Ghoukas
NICK
Hi Ghoukas
(then to Nagopian)
Thank you for believing in what
were doing here

MR NAGOPIAN
Believing is my business And how
is business

NICK
So far so good Weve got a big
pitch lined up Could be great for-

MR NAGOPIAN
Good good Well we’re not here
to get in the way We just came by
to remind you that your repayment
is due tomorrow

NICK
Re-what now

MR NAGOPIAN
Your repayment Didn’t Dale
explain to you the terms of our
loan

NICK
Loan You made a capital
investment Didn’t you take a ten
percent stake in the company

MR NAGOPIAN
Why would I want ten percent of
“the Shower Friend”

NICK
Shower Buddy

MR NAGOPIAN
Friend Buddy It’s a stupid idea

NICK
Then why did you invest in it

MR NAGOPIAN
I didn’t I simply loaned you and
your friends a million dollars for
a month And tomorrow you owe me
two million dollars

NICK
I think there’s been a
misunderstanding--
(pushing his intercom)
(MORE)

NICK (CONTD)
Jennifer can you get Dale and Kurt
in here please

MR NAGOPIAN
It’s all in the paperwork Dale
signed on your behalf

NICK
So what is this Some kind of
scam

MR NAGOPIAN
A scam No one forced you to
borrow a million dollars from us

NICK
There’s no way we can make a
payment like that by tomorrow The
money you gave us is all invested
in the company

MR NAGOPIAN
In that case I wouldn’t be
surprised if something unpleasant
happened to you and your friends

NICK
Are you threatening us

MR NAGOPIAN
Of course not I’ve just noticed
that the people who fail to repay
me tend to have accidents And
strangely Ghoukas is often the one
who finds them

NICK
That’s a threat

MR NAGOPIAN
It’s not Have some sympathy for
poor Ghoukas He’s the one who’s
always finding these horribly
disfigured bodies

GHOUKAS
I kill them

MR NAGOPIAN
Ghoukas We’re doing a conceit

Ghoukas shrugs

MR NAGOPIAN (CONTD)
All I’m saying is if you fail to
repay me by tomorrow something
terrible may or may not happen to
you and your friends

GHOUKAS
I’1l kill you

MR NAGOPIAN
Ghoukas

NICK
All right you know what This is
the stupidest shakedown ever If
we die how are we going to pay you
back

MR NAGOPIAN
From the life insurance policies
Dale signed

NICK
He didn’t say anything about life
insurance policies

MR NAGOPIAN
That’s probably because he didn’t
read them

NICK
Fuuuuck

MR NAGOPIAN
Don’t worry Nick One way or the
other I’ll get my money

He pats Nick on the cheek and starts to exit Ghoukas heads
out right on his heels

MR NAGOPIAN (CONT’D)
Ghoukas please You don’t have to
walk that close

Ghoukas stops walking Nagopian exits Ghoukas stands
there unsure what to do

MR NAGOPIAN (0S) (CONT’D)
Now you’re too far

Ghoukas heads out

Nick slumps in his chair and distractedly grabs a Nickurdale
stress reliever ball He squeezes the hell out of it for a
beat

Dale and Kurt enter

DALE
Hey was that Mr Nagopian I saw
leaving Why wouldn’t he say hi
That’s weird--

In the blink of an eye Nick grabs Dale and slaps him across
the face

DALE (CONTD)
Ow

NICK
You fucking idiot

Kurt steps between them

KURT
Hey hey What’s all this

Nick reaches past Kurt and smacks Dale again

DALE
Ow

NICK
You killed us We’re all dead
thanks to you

DALE
What did I do

KURT
What did he do

NICK
Nagopian That “venture capital”
guy he got our money from He’s
nothing but a loanshark Dale
signed papers saying that tomorrow
we owe him two million bucks backed
up with life insurance policies
If we don’t pay we die

Kurt turns to Dale and looks at him for a moment Then he
also smacks him across the face

DALE
Ow

Nick slaps Dale again

DALE (CONTD)
Stop it How was I supposed to
know There was so much to read

KURT
You goddamn moron

NICK
I knew I shouldn’t have listened to
you guys I gave up my career for
this

KURT
Youre worried about your career
What about our lives Did this
Nagopian actually threaten you

NICK
Basically Ghoukas definitely did

KURT
What’s a Ghoukas

DALE
We should go to the cops

NICK
And tell them what That Nagopian
handed us perfectly legal loan
documents which you forged our
signatures on All that does is
send you to prison

DALE
It does
KURT
I’m fine with that
DALE
Hang on
NICK

I’m fine with it too But as far
as Nagopian’s concerned we still
stole a million dollars from him
You don’t think Ghoukas is going to
kill us

DALE
What’s a Ghoukas

NICK
(to Kurt)
If we liquidated everything right
now how much cash would we have

KURT
About three hundred grand

NICK
That means we have three days to
come up with 17 million dollars

KURT
So basically we’re riding a cat
without a candle

NICK
What What is that

KURT
It’s a saying It means we’re
fucked

DALE

I think I’ve heard that

NICK
No you havent

KURT
It’s a common expression It’s
from the olden days

NICK
It’s from the no days Why would
you ride a cat And why would a
candle help

KURT
I don’t know I didn’t come up
with it

NICK

I think you did

DALE
Guys please The longer we fight
the more we’re riding a cat without
a candle

Nick’s assistant JENNIFER pops her head in

She goes

JENNIFER
Guys The SkyMall people said
they’re on their way

KURT
Shit that’s right

NICK
Hang on This could be a good
thing If we sell these guys on
the Buddy we could get enough up-
front money to pay off Nagopian

DALE
So we’ve just gotta nail this
pitch

KURT

Or we die No pressure
The guys exchange tense looks

SMASH CUT TO

INT NICKURDALE CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

Nick Kurt and Dale are mid-pitch They look FRAZZLED and
SWEATY as they stand across from two seated SkyMall reps DAN
and CLAIRE 40s

Behind the guys is a large schematic drawing on an easel
along with a PORTABLE SHOWER STALL with a Shower Buddy
attached

DALE
(rapid-fire manic)
-there’s a reason everybody hates
showers because it takes so long
and the average person wastes one
week every month taking showers--

NICK
Well maybe not a week--

DALE
It’s all the soaping up and the
rinsing off and the shampooing and
the rinsing off and the
conditioning and the rinsing off--

KURT NICK
What Dale is trying to say Dale means that we waste a
is the Shower Buddy lot of time showering and the
eliminates the wasted time Shower Buddy helps to
and streamlines your shower streamline that process
process
CLAIRE
Sounds great How does it work
DALE
That’s an excellent question
Claire
KURT

Great question

NICK
Really good

There’s an awkward silence

CLAIRE
-So how does it work
NICK
Right--
(to Kurt)

You wanna get her in here
Kurt hurries out

NICK (CONTD)
We thought the best way to show you
how the Shower Buddy works is to
show you how the Shower Buddy
works

Dale crosses to the shower stall and begins fiddling with a
portable water pump attached to a tank

Kurt ushers in a 20-something model BROOKE in a bathrobe

KURT
(to Brooke)
Hurry hurry
(to Dan and Claire)
This is Brooke She’s gonna
demonstrate the Shower Buddy for
you by taking a shower Brooke

Brooke drops her robe She’s in a bikini

KURT (CONTD)
Sorry Dan I know you were hoping
she was naked under there
(to Claire)
Don’t tell his wife

CLAIRE
I am his wife

KURT
(covering)
I know Husband and wife Working
together You’re like Lucy and
Desi Only at SkyMall Nice

DALE
(to himself)
This fucking pump
Brooke steps into the stall

NICK
How we doin’ Dale

DALE
I think there’s something wrong
with the motor on this pump But I
can do it by hand No biggie

KURT
(nudging Claire and Dan)
Our next invention’s gonna be a
better water pump Right husband
and wife

Dale kneels beside the stall and begins rhythmically jerking
the water pump

DALE
Might take a second here to get the
flow going

Brooke stands awkwardly in the dry shower

NICK
(to Claire and Dan)
Shouldnt be long

DALE
(pumping away)
Getting close Almost there

There’s an uncomfortable beat as they all watch Dale
There’s no getting around how much it looks like he’s jerking
off on his knees beside a woman in a shower

DALE (CONTD)
Close your eyes Brooke Here it
comes

Just then a GOB OF LIQUID SOAP dribbles out of the Shower
Buddy landing on Brooke’s face

DALE (CONT’D)
Yes

The model does her best to work with the limited amount of
water dribbling on her She spreads the soap on her chest

KURT
(whispering to Nick)
Kinda looks like--

NICK
(sotto)
I know
(then)
Dale can we get any more water
pressure here

DALE
(winded)
I’m pumping as hard as I can

KURT
All right let me help

Kurt joins Dale and the two of them begin working the pump
together

NICK
(to Dan and Claire)
Okay well obviously this isn’t
the best demonstration With
normal water pressure there’s a
steady stream of soap delivered--

BROOKE
Ow It got in my eyes

NICK
Twist the nozzle to “rinse”

BROOKE
I can’t see

She fumbles with the showerhead

NICK
All right let me help you

Nick reaches into the stall and tries to adjust the
showerhead

NICK (CONTD)
Ugh it got in my mouth

Creamy soap runs down his and Brooke’s arms as Dale and
Kurt on their knees and dripping with flop sweat continue
to pump away
ANGLE ON DAN and CLAIRE who look appalled

DALE (0S)

Not so hard Kurt you’re hurting

brought him some fresh meat he’d
cut me some slack

DALE
Fresh meat

DENNY
I’m sorry I dragged you into this
But hey maybe if we work together
we can fix it

NICK
What do you mean

DENNY
Neither of us alone has enough
evidence against these guys but if
we combine what we know I bet we
can figure out a way to turn the
tables on Nagopian

KURT
How

DENNY
Leave that to me Come on over to
my place The address is--

NICK
We have it It’s on your Facebook
page

NICK
That’s great That’s perfect We
borrowed money from a mob boss

KURT
(to Hagan)
Hang on If you know he’s a
criminal why don’t you arrest him

HAGAN
Nagopian’s smart He keeps himself
insulated from the shit his gang
does And as far as we can tell
this here was just an accident

NICK
And what happens on Monday when the
three of us also die in accidents

HAGAN
Well then I’1l have a case

DALE
Will you at least come with us to
Nagopian’s office where I met with

evidence there

Hagan looks at his watch and sighs

HAGAN

by a middle-aged executive TIM at a desk

TIM
Hi you must be my five o’clock

DALE

TIM
No Are you my five oclock

HAGAN
(to the guys)

HAGAN

EXT OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

It’s dark now and it’s begun to drizzle as Hagan crosses
his car with the guys on his heels

NICK
Detective if you go we’re as good
as dead

HAGAN

Since I’ve known you three nothing
youve told me has been true Why
would I listen to you now

DALE
Can’t you at least give us some
police protection

HAGAN
Protection from what Your own
foolishness

Hagan climbs into his car

KURT
So you’re just going to drive away
and leave us riding a cat without a
candle

HAGAN
The hell you say

KURT
It’s an expression

HAGAN
No it isn’t

Hagan slams the door and drives off

building--

Kurt puts a hand over Dale’s mouth and keeps it there

KURT
(to Nick)
What do we do now

NICK
Let’s figure it out in the car
There’s no point standing out here
in the rain

SMASH CUT TO

INT KURT’S CAR - MINUTES LATER

Kurt drives Nick is up front and Dale in the back Without
the benefit of a windshield or a sunroof WIND-DRIVEN RAIN
soaks the guys as they drive Kurt shields his eyes with his
hand so he can see They yell over the wind

KURT
Glad we got out of the rain

The windshield wipers flop ridiculously across the dashboard

NICK
Maybe we should all stay together
tonight Might be safer

DALE
Good idea But not my place I
don’t want my pregnant wife to get
blown up

NICK
Kurt your apartment is probably
the most secure

KURT
Okay we can--

Just then a wet PLASTIC BAG flies through the open
windshield and sticks to Kurt’s face The car VEERS wildly
as he tries to pull the bag off Nick and Dale scream

INT PARKING GARAGE - LATER

Still damp the guys exit the car and head for the stairs
Kurt absentmindedly locks his windowless car BEEP

NICK
It’s good that you locked it

They head for the stairs to Kurt’s loft

DALE

We’ve got to establish a secure
perimeter at your place Booby
traps an early warning system
I’m going to need twine small
bells thumb tacks mousetraps--

KURT
Calm down Macaulay Culkin I’ve

INT KURT’S LOFT - MOMENTS LATER

The door to Kurt’s loft opens and the guys enter

DALE

thing is that we’re ready for them
if they do come

Kurt flips on the lights and they all gasp as they see
Nagopian’s thug Ghoukas sitting on the sofa pointing a gun
at them Another armed THUG appears behind them in the hall

DALE
Oh god

NICK
(to Kurt)

I thought you said you had an
alarm

KURT

KURT
(horrified)

GHOUKAS

KURT
Oh

Thanks

EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

An SUV pulls up to a construction trailer which is set up
beside an unfinished 10-story office building Ghoukas and
the other thug open the door and escort the guys toward the
trailer

Kurt notices a sign reading “Nagopian Construction”

KURT
(to the guys)
He’s also got a construction
company

NICK
That’s probably how he set up in
that other building before it
opened

DALE
Wow Construction venture

Renaissance man

INT NAGOPIAN’S CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

Nick Kurt and Dale stand across from Nagopian who sits at a
metal desk covered in blueprints Ghoukas and the other thug
hover nearby

MR NAGOPIAN
So you don’t have my money

NICK
It’s just not possible to double a
million dollar loan in one month
Ghoukas snickers

Jesus

MR NAGOPIAN
Not normally no

KURT
Come on man There has to be a
more reasonable payment plan
option

MR NAGOPIAN
Of course there is It’s called
“The Ghoukas Kills You” plan

MR NAGOPIAN (CONTD)

Here’s what I’m thinking

(to Kurt and Nick)
On your way home you two will die
in a terrible car accident Your
bodies will be so badly burned it
will be impossible for forensics to
know that you were already dead
before the car crashed

KURT NICK

So specific

DALE
(nervously)
What about me

MR NAGOPIAN
You
(considers then)
Auto-erotic asphyxiation

DALE
Wha

MR NAGOPIAN
The police will find you hanging
from a belt with your cock in your
hand

DALE
Aw man Can’t I just be in the
car with them

MR NAGOPIAN
No

DALE
Well isn’t there another way I can
die

MR NAGOPIAN
Fine
(beat)
The police will find you with your
head in the oven

DALE
That’s better

MR NAGOPIAN
and your cock in your hand

DALE
Cmon

KURT
Wait You don’t want to kill us
Dale’s wife is pregnant with

DALE

KURT

KURT
(to Nagopian)

NICK

MR NAGOPIAN
(to Ghoukas)

MR NAGOPIAN (CONTD)

NICK
Okay great What is it

MR NAGOPIAN
Today I sold a truck to Arafia
Pandilla

DALE
Who’s he

MR NAGOPIAN
It’s not a “he” It’s a Dominican
street gang And they’re assholes
(MORE )

MR NAGOPIAN (CONTD)
They’re keeping the truck at a
strip club they own If you can
steal it from them and bring it
back to me tonight I’1l consider
your debt paid

KURT
Why would you steal back something
you just sold

MR NAGOPIAN
Because that way I get their money
and my truck back

DALE
This truck must mean a lot to you
Has it been in your family a long
time

MR NAGOPIAN
What No I don’t give a shit
about the truck I want what’s in
the truck

NICK
What’s in the truck

MR NAGOPIAN

None of your fucking business

Just get it back by sun-up And if
you try to run--

GHOUKAS
Something terrible may or may not
happen to you and your families

MR NAGOPIAN
No Ghoukas We’re past the
conceit now

GHOUKAS
Oh
(to the guys)
I’1l1 kill you and your families

EXT URBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

The SUV driven by Ghoukas heads off leaving Nick Kurt and
Dale standing on the curb

KURT
Now where the fuck are we

NICK
(pointing)
That must be the strip club

A block away from them is a seedy unwelcoming club with a

neon sign that reads “PUTAS DESNUDAS”

DALE
“Putas Desnudas” What does that
mean

NICK

“Naked Whores”

KURT
Kind of on-the-nose huh

NICK
I don’t see a truck

They walk closer to the club and notice around the corner is
a fenced-in parking lot with an 18-wheeler parked inside

TWO heavily tattooed HISPANIC GUARDS stand nearby
quickly back up into the shadows

KURT
Look at this A locked fence
guards It’s a suicide mission

NICK
I think that’s what Nagopian had in
mind

DALE

Those guys have tattoos on their
faces That does not bode well

NICK
If it were easy to rob a truck from
one gang and give it to another
people would be doing it all the
time

DALE
I had no idea starting a small
business would be this hard

KURT
All right let’s just put our heads
together and figure out how to pull
this off without getting killed

There’s a long beat

DALE
(to himself)
What would Ocean’s 11 do

NICK
Well first of all they’d have
eight more people

Our guys
KURT
And I don’t think we’re going to
have to do backflips through a room
full of lasers in there

DALE
Youre thinking of Catherine Zeta-
Jones in “Entrapment”

KURT
No I’m not Catherine Zeta-Jones
was also in “Ocean’s 11”

DALE
No she wasn’t She was in
“Ocean’s 12”

KURT
It was the same cast

DALE
Yeah plus a twelfth person
Catherine Zeta-Jones

KURT
You’re an idiot

DALE
Am I Okay I’m iMDB’ing it

He starts furiously typing into his smart phone

NICK
Probably not the best use of our
time

KURT
Well there is one thing all those
movies had in common Besides
Catherine Zeta-Jones

DALE
(still typing)
No

KURT
(to Nick)
They always created a distraction
so the rest of the team could carry
out the heist

NICK
That’s true Maybe create a
commotion inside the club Draw
the guards in

KURT
What are you thinking Smoke
pellets
NICK
Do you have smoke pellets
KURT
No
NICK
Do you know how to make smoke
pellets
KURT
Nope
NICK
Guess that rules out smoke pellets

(then)
What if two of us stage a fake
fight in there Get everyone
watching that

KURT

That only leaves one of us to hot-
wire the truck and no one to keep a
lookout

NICK
Shit

DALE
What did I say
(holds up his phone)
Ocean’s 11 No Catherine Zeta-Jo--

Kurt swats the phone out of Dale’s hand

DALE (CONT’D)
Hey

Dale scrambles after it Kurt turns back to Nick as if
nothing happened

KURT
We’re gonna need a fourth person

NICK
Who do we know that we can call at
one in the morning to help us
commit a really dangerous crime

SMASH CUT TO

INT DIVE BAR - NIGHT

The guys sit in their regular booth across from MOTHERFUCKER
JONES

MOTHERFUCKER
You three clowns just can’t abide
by the law can you

NICK
Clearly some bad decisions were
made Now can you please help us
Motherfucker Jones

MOTHERFUCKER
What’d you call me

NICK
Motherfucker Jones Isn’t that
your name

MOTHERFUCKER
Not anymore I changed it when I
got married

KURT
Oh congratulations

MOTHERFUCKER
Thank you

DALE
Your wife didn’t like the name
“Motherfucker”

MOTHERFUCKER
No bitch She didn’t like the
name “Jones” I took her last
name

KURT
Really

DALE
(to Motherfucker )
So what’s your name now

MOTHERFUCKER
Motherfucker Quang She’s Chinese
The hot kind Not the big round
head kind

NICK
So she was okay with “Motherfucker”
but she didn’t like “Jones”
MOTHERFUCKER
I’m pretty sure she doesn’t know
what the word “motherfucker” means
She doesn’t know what a lot of
words mean

DALE
She sounds nice

KURT
But why did you take her last name

MOTHERFUCKER
Because I respect women and I
believe in equality

KURT
That’s fair

MOTHERFUCKER

And because she does everything I
tell her to do No matter how
fucked up

DALE
(to himself)
That took a weird turn

NICK
Okay we don’t have a lot of time
here So we need to know if you’1l
help us Motherfucker Quang

MOTHERFUCKER
I’‘ll help you But it’ll be fifty
large

KURT
Here we go

NICK
No It’s not going to be fifty
large It’s not going to be
anything large It’s going to be
small

MOTHERFUCKER
(sighs then)
All right Gimme your watch

NICK
This is a Tag Heuer

MOTHERFUCKER
I know what it is

KURT
Just give it to him Nick

Nick rolls his eyes and gives Motherfucker the watch

MOTHERFUCKER
Thank you From here on out I’m
going to be your heist consultant

They all ad lib “no’s” as they usher him out of the booth

EXT URBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER

The guys stand with Motherfucker across from the strip club
parking lot

MOTHERFUCKER
I don’t know about this You
didn’t tell me these guys had
tattoos on their faces

KURT
You have tattoos on your head

MOTHERFUCKER
That’s different I grow out my
hair I look like everyone else
They grow out their hair they look
even crazier

NICK
We can’t turn back now

MOTHERFUCKER

He turns and starts to walk away

NICK

KURT

Okay here’s how I see this going
down Motherfucker and I will
stage a fight in the club As soon
as the guards come inside to break
it up you and Dale climb the
fence hot wire the truck drive it
through the fence and pick us up
out front

NICK
Seems like Dale and I have the much
harder end of the plan

KURT
Are you kidding Do you know how
hard it is to stage a convincing
fake fight The only reason I’ve
chosen myself for it is because--

NICK
(rolling his eyes)
Don’t say “West Side Story”

KURT
“West Side Story” The school
paper said I was the most
convincing Bernardo they’d ever
seen

DALE
(leaning in to
Motherfucker)
Bernardo is Maria’s brother The
leader of the Sharks

Motherfucker just stares at Dale

NICK
Yeah well I was Tony I know how
to fake fight too

KURT

Come on Nick You know Tony
avoided all the rumbles like a
little bitch Bernardo was deep in
the shit the whole show

(then)
Dale you saw the show Which of
us was the better fake fighter

DALE
(delicately)
You were

Nick scoffs

DALE (CONT’D)
You were the better dancer Nick

MOTHERFUCKER
Fuck this shit

Motherfucker turns and starts to walk away

NICK
Okay wait Motherfucker-- You and
Kurt will do the fake fight Dale
and I will steal the truck
Somehow

DALE
Good luck guys

KURT
The Sharks are going to have their
way tonight

As they split up Motherfucker turns to Kurt

MOTHERFUCKER
You three should just fuck each
other already

INT STRIP CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

Kurt and Motherfucker enter the dimly-lit club which is
populated by dozens of Arafia Pandilla GANG BANGERS who greet
them with hostile looks On a stage a STRIPPER works the
pole

KURT
Damn This place makes your bar
look like the Cheesecake Factory

They take a seat at a table near the stage and eye their
surroundings nervously

MOTHERFUCKER
So how do you want to do this

KURT
I guess we should start with some
raised voices then I’1l throw the
first punch I won’t touch you
but it’ll be close so you gotta
pretend I made contact Then we’1ll
just sort of wing it from there
WWE style

MOTHERFUCKER
(raising his voice)
That sounds good to me

KURT
(also raising his voice)
Oh okay We’re going right into
this

Kurt stands knocking his chair down Motherfucker does the
same A few heads turn It’s hard for other people to hear
what they’re yelling over the music

MOTHERFUCKER
Fuck yeah we are

Motherfucker grabs Kurt by the shirt

KURT
‘Cause I kinda wanted to psych
myself up for it a little more

Kurt gives Motherfucker a little shove

MOTHERFUCKER
Might as well get this over with
‘cause I gotta work in the morning

KURT
(“angrily”)
I didn’t know you had a job What
do you do

Motherfucker shoves Kurt back

MOTHERFUCKER
(“furious”)
I run the coffee shop at a Barnes
and Noble

KURT
(outraged)
Nice

Motherfucker grabs a bottle and breaks it on the edge of the
table

KURT (CONTD)
(still threatening)
Oh shit Don’t tell me you’re
actually gonna use that bottle
‘Cause that would really hurt me

MOTHERFUCKER
(getting in his face)
Don’t worry I wont

Motherfucker sets the bottle on the table By now most of
the bar patrons are watching this “fight”

KURT
I’m gonna punch you in the face
with my right hand You ready for
that

MOTHERFUCKER
Bring it

Kurt winds back and PUNCHES Motherfucker in the face but
instead of missing him he accidentally NAILS HIM RIGHT IN
THE NOSE Motherfucker falls back and clutches his face

KURT
(realizing)
Oh my god I’m so sorry

MOTHERFUCKER
You hit me

Motherfucker looks at his hand and sees that his nose is
bleeding

KURT
I know You must’ve leaned into
it

MOTHERFUCKER
Leaned into it I’11 lean into
you bitch

Now angry for real Motherfucker punches Kurt

KURT
Ow Hey

MOTHERFUCKER
You want another one Bernardo

The patrons regard this scuffle with little interest
Motherfucker lunges for Kurt who tries to fend him off with
a chair But instead of hitting Motherfucker with it he
swings it into a table where TWO GANG MEMBERS sit

KURT
Uh oh

The gang members stand up and grab the chair from Kurt One
of them HURLS it at him but Kurt DODGES at the last second
and the chair flies into another GANG MEMBER who looks
pissed

All at once the club ERUPTS IN A FRENZY of chair-throwing
punching and brawling

EXT STRIP CLUB - CONTINUOUS

Nick and Dale stand in the shadows watching the club’s
parking lot Nick notices a THUG come out of the club and
gesture for the two guards to come inside They leave their
posts and head in

NICK
Look They’re going in

DALE
Now’s our chance

They sneak over to the 10-foot chain-link fence topped with
barbed wire that encloses the parking lot

NICK
There’s barbed wire How do we get
over that

DALE
Not a problem

Dale takes off his jacket

NICK
What are you doing

DALE
I’ve seen people do this You toss
your jacket onto the barbed wire
and then you just climb over it

NICK
Okay Do it

Dale tosses his jacket up and right over the fence where
it lands on the ground on the other side Nick gives hima
look

DALE
I overshot it

Dale tries to fish his jacket through a link in the fence but
it’s too thick and he only manages to wedge it halfway
through

DALE (CONTD)
Damn it
(then)
Can I have your jacket

NICK
No I’11 do it

Nick takes his jacket off puts his over his shoulder then
carefully climbs up the fence

DALE
Oh you’re not going to toss it
from the ground That makes
sense

Nick reaches the top and drapes his coat over the barbed
wire He delicately clambers over the top

NICK
(hushed)
Ow Ow Shit
He reaches the ground

DALE
See I told you that would work

NICK
Didn’t work at all Dale Went
right through the jacket

Nick holds out his hands which are flecked with bloody
scratches

DALE
Oof
INT STRIP CLUB - CONTINUOUS

Kurt and Motherfucker cower next to the stage as COMPLETE
CHAOS surrounds them

KURT
Look obviously I didn’t hit you on
purpose I said I’m sorry

A stripper falls off the stage and lands on them

MOTHERFUCKER
All right I’m done with this
shit

Motherfucker stands

KURT
Where are you going

MOTHERFUCKER
Home You guys are a bad influence
on me

He scurries toward the exit

KURT
Motherfucker Quang wait We’1l
give you fifty thousand shares

INT COUNTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

We’re seeing the chaos from above through an interior
window

OSCAR (0S)
(Spanish with subtitles)
What’s going on down there

REVEAL OSCAR 30’s a tough as nails Arafia Pandilla member

with the word “J€fE” tattooed across his forehead (think
Javier Bardem) He smokes a cigarette and maintains an eerie
calm even under the most extreme circumstances

As he looks out a window onto the floor of the club two GANG
MEMBERS bundle stacks of cash behind him

GANG MEMBER
(Spanish with subtitles)
Some kind of fight

Oscar notices the two guards who came in from outside are
among the fighters

OSCAR
(calmly)
Who’s guarding my fucking truck

Oscar puts the cigarette in his mouth and heads out of the
office

INT STRIP CLUB - CONTINUOUS

Oscar goes down the stairs and into the war zone of the club
As he heads for the back door he is completely unfazed by
the violence around him He’s like Robert Duvall in
“Apocalypse Now” but instead of explosions he walks through
flying chairs and bottles

EXT TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

The 18-wheeler sits in the lot A very faint light can be
seen coming from inside the cab

DALE (0S)
We’re looking for a red wire with a
green or yellow stripe

INT TRUCK CABIN - CONTINUOUS
Nick and Dale crouch on the floor of the truck Nick holds a

handful of wires from under the steering column while Dale
follows instruction on his smartphone

NICK
I see a blue wire with a yellow
stripe--

DALE

No Don’t touch that one

NICK
Calm down We’re not defusing a
nuclear warhead

DALE
Right Sorry I’m a little jumpy

NICK
Here’s a red wire

DALE
Okay good According to this wiki
that should be the power wire We
need to connect that to the starter

wire
NICK

Which is the starter wire
DALE

Hang on it’s loading

(beat)
Loading

NICK
Come on Dale

DALE
I can’t help it It’s 3G
(beat)
Loading

Suddenly they hear a door bang shut outside

NICK
What was that

Dale peeks up out the window and sees Oscar emerging from the
club and looking around suspiciously

DALE
(whisper yell)
Someone’s coming

NICK
Get down

Nick yanks Dale down below the window

EXT PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

Oscar notices Dale’s jacket wedged into the bottom of the
chain-link fence He tosses away his cigarette as he crosses
to the back of the truck He takes out his keys unlocks the
rear door and opens it He checks out the contents of the
trailer (we don’t see what’s inside)

INT TRUCK CABIN - CONTINUOUS

Nick and Dale huddle together terrified

DALE
What’s he doing back there

NICK
Shhh

Just then they hear the rear door slam shut
CLOSE ON the jumble of exposed wires The slight movement of
the cabin from the door slamming causes the red wire to make
contact with a brown one The two wires SPARK and we hear
SFX Truck ignition starting

DALE

(hushed)
Yes

NICK
(hushed)
No
EXT TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Oscar reacts startled to the sound of the truck starting up

OSCAR
éQué diablos

He crosses to the driver’s side door and pulls it open
revealing

No one

INT TRUCK CABIN - CONTINUOUS

Oscar climbs into the driver’s seat and examines the
ignition As he does we REVEAL Nick and Dale cowering in
the backseat directly behind Oscar

Oscar is about to turn in their direction when Dale spots a
six-pack of Coke on the floor Without thinking he grabs a
can and BASHES Oscar over the head with it

OSCAR
Augghhh

Oscar crumples over in the front seat Nick and Dale
exchange a look of shock

NICK
Jesus Dale

Before Dale can reply Oscar sits up

OSCAR
What the fuck was that--

Dale hits him again Coke spritzes out of the dented can
OSCAR (CONTD)
(still conscious
Ow My head
CLONK Dale slams him again

OSCAR (CONTD)
You son of a--

CLONK

OSCAR (CONTD)
Fuck

Nick and Dale can’t believe this guy is still awake

NICK

You’re not hitting him hard enough
DALE

I’m hitting as hard as I can You

try it

Nick grabs a fresh can of Coke and clocks Oscar over the
head But still Oscar fails to fall unconscious

OSCAR
Damn it

Nick and Dale both start BASHING Oscar over the head with
their respective cans Coke sprays everywhere

OSCAR (CONTD)
Ouch Shit Oooh

At long last Oscar slumps over out cold Nick and Dale
catch their breath

DALE
God it’s hard to knock someone
out

NICK

Especially with a soda can
There’s a beat Dale takes a sip from his battered can
NICK (CONTD)
(noticing something)
Oh damn

REVERSE to see several THUGS exiting the club and hurrying
toward the truck

NICK (CONT’D)
We’ve gotta go

Nick and Dale scramble into the front seat
DALE
(re Oscar)
What about him

NICK
Just move him over

Dale drags Oscar off the front seat as Nick slams the door
shut and grabs the gearshift

NICK (CONTD)
Let’s get the hell out of here

ACTION MUSIC crescendoes as Nick stomps on the gas pedal
but the truck doesn’t move Instead we hear a horrible
GRINDING SOUND from the engine

DALE
What are you doing

NICK
I don’t know how to drive a truck
There’s like eighteen gears on this
thing

A GUNSHOT rings out shattering the driver’s side window
Dale and Nick duck down

DALE
They’re shooting at us

NICK
I got that

Nick continues to grind the gears and the noise gets even
uglier By now the gang members are almost upon the truck

NICK (CONTD)
Come on first gear where are
you

Finally he grinds it into gear and the truck slowly lurches
forward toward the fence

DALE
Gun it

NICK
I’m trying Dale There’s like
five pedals down there

EXT PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

A THUG manages to leap onto the side of the cab He climbs
up to the window and points his gun at Nick Just as he’s
about to fire the truck rumbles through the fence -- not
fast but with enough speed to bust through The torn fence
scrapes along the sides of the truck and YANKS the thug from
his perch

EXT STRIP CLUB - MOMENTS LATER
Kurt runs out the front door of the club just as the truck
clumsily barrels around the corner the trailer jumping the

curb and taking out a parking meter

Kurt hurries over as Nick slows down for him to climb aboard

INT TRUCK CABIN - CONTINUOUS

Kurt slams the door shut as he takes a seat behind Nick and
Dale

KURT
Took you long enough Do you have
any idea what was going on in
there

NICK
Do you have any idea what was going
on in here

DALE
Where’s Motherfucker

KURT
He took off Couldn’t take the
heat
(then noticing Oscar)
Who’s this gentleman

DALE
He’s in the gang We knocked him
out with cans

KURT
No shit That’s cool
NICK
We should probably tie him up or

something

Kurt finds some bungee cords and proceeds to tie Oscar’s
hands behind his back

NICK (CONTD)
Are they following us

DALE
(looking out the side
window)
I don’t see anyone
(then)
Hey what do you think is in this
truck anyway

NICK
No idea Could be anything
Drugs weapons

KURT
Sex slaves

DALE
I hope it’s not sex slaves

NICK
It’s not our business The less we
know the better
(beat)
Ill go easier on the turns in case

SFX Dale’s cell phone rings
DALE
(into phone)
Hey honey What’s up

INTERCUT WITH

to her

STACY

Kurt and Nick exchange a look

STACY

NICK

Not to mention the man with the

DALE

(steely)
You listen to me My wife and
babies are the most important
things in the world to me And
nothing’s going to stop me from
being there for them So you
either drive this fucking rig to my
house and pick up Stacy or I will

He holds a Coke can and glares at Nick threateningly Nick
glances over at Kurt who shrugs

EXT STREET - CONTINUOUS

Nick takes a hard left The trailer SCRAPES against a parked
car nearly totalling it

EXT DALE’S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

Dale and Kurt carefully help Stacy to the truck

STACY
What is this What are you
driving

DALE

It’s a truck
(thinking fast)
It’s the Nickurdale company truck

INT TRUCK CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

Dale helps Stacy recline in the back seat as Kurt climbs in
the front and Nick pulls away from the curb

NICK
Hey Stacy How you feeling

STACY
Hey Nick I didn’t know you knew
how to drive a truck

NICK
Oh yeah Been driving them since I

was-—-

He is drowned out by a DEAFENING GRINDING SOUND as he
struggles to shift gears

All of a sudden Stacy lets out a SCREAM

DALE
What Is it a contraction

STACY
There’s a man on the floor

She points to Oscar who lies unconscious at her feet

DALE
Oh right That’s
(sees the Jefe” tattoo on
Oscar’s forehead)
Jeffy He’s an old college pal
Latino college pal

STACY
What’s wrong with him

KURT
He’s a drunk Big drunk We call

him Jeffy the Drunk

STACY
He’s got so many tattoos He looks

like a gang member

DALE
That’s a little racist hon

STACY
Youre right I’m sorry

As they speak Nick notices something out his side-view
mirror

NICK
(quietly)
Kurt Is that--

Kurt checks his mirror and sees two cars speeding up on the
truck’s tail Inside can be seen several of the Arafia
Pandilla members

KURT
Shit Gun it

Nick floors it and the truck picks up speed At the same
time Stacy begins to MOAN as her contractions get worse

DALE
Hang on babe Just try to relax
and stay calm

Dale glances out his window and sees one of the gang cars has
caught up and pulled alongside A GANG MEMBER leans out his
window and aims a 9MM pistol at them

DALE (CONTD)
Fuck my shit

NICK
Hang on

He SWERVES SHARPLY to the right putting some distance
between the truck and the gang car

STACY
What’s going on

DALE
Nothing You just focus on keeping
those babies inside for a little
longer
CLOSE ON the speedometer which reads 90 MPH

Kurt checks his mirror again and sees another GANG MEMBER
aiming his gun at them

SMASH The mirror SHATTERS as a bullet strikes it

KURT
Whoa

Nick can see that the cars have taken positions on either
side of the truck Thinking fast he swerves first left
then right causing the trailer to JACKKNIFE just enough to
impact each car The gang cars go into a spin driving off
the road and onto the shoulders

NICK
Yes

The truck increases its distance from the pursuers

KURT
I think we’re losing them

STACY
The babies

DALE
No no The babies are fine

SFX POLICE SIREN

NICK
No way

Sure enough a PATROL CAR has pulled out and is speeding up
behind the truck

KURT
Gun it

NICK
I’m not gunning anything It’sa
cop

Nick slows down and pulls over to the side of the road The
squad car stops behind the truck and a PATROLMAN steps out

EXT STREET - SAME TIME

Several hundred yards back the two cars full of gang members
have stopped and turned off their lights waiting to see what
happens

EXT TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
The Patrolman approaches Nick’s window

PATROLMAN
Do you know you were doing 90 miles
an hour back there A class 7

NICK

DALE (0S)
Nothing secret

KURT (0S)

The Patrolman reacts to the disembodied voices

PATROLMAN
All right well you’re going to
show me Everyone out of the cab

Just then Stacy lets out a pained MOAN

PATROLMAN (CONTD)
What the hell’s going on in there

He steps up on the running board and peers into the cab
From his POV he sees Dale tending to Stacy Oscar isn’t
visible

PATROLMAN (CONT’D)
Is she all right

KURT
She’s having a baby
DALE
Triplets
Stacy moans again
NICK

That’s actually why we were
speeding We’re taking her to the
hospital

PATROLMAN
Why didn’t you say so Come on
I’ll give you an escort

Suddenly Oscar MOANS as he begins to regain consciousness

The Patrolman looks puzzled for a moment Stacy moans again
and he shakes it off and hurries back to his car

KURT
All right then

As soon as the cop is gone Dale grabs a fresh can of soda
and CLOCKS Oscar over the head with it Oscar slumps over

STACY
Why did you hit your friend with a
can

DALE

(struggling to cover)
It’s an inside joke Don’t worry

The patrol car turns on its siren and pulls out The truck
follows

EXT STREET - CONTINUOUS

The gang members watch pissed off as the truck leaves with
the cop

He hurries inside Kurt and Nick help Stacy out of the truck
as the cop joins them

STACY
Oh god They’re coming out

Dale runs back out pushing a wheelchair and Stacy sits

NICK
(to Patrolman)
Thank you Officer You’ve been a
big help

PATROLMAN
My pleasure Yknow I’ve always

cop

KURT
Aww that’s nice

PATROLMAN

(then)
Well we don’t want to keep you

Nick and Kurt exchange a fearful look

NICK
Uhhh

PATROLMAN
(no nonsense)
Let’s go

Nick lets out a sigh and slowly leads the Patrolman toward
the rear door of the trailer He and Kurt stand there
staring at the door for a beat

NICK
Here we are

PATROLMAN
Open it please

NICK
Yup

Nick unlatches the door and slides it up revealing the
trailer’s interior The patrolman shines his flashlight
inside

PATROLMAN
Holy crap

REVERSE ANGLE to reveal stacked boxes labeled “DORA THE
EXPLORER PLUSH DOLLS”

Kurt and Nick exhale relieved
PATROLMAN (CONT’D)

NICK
Big “Dora the Explorer” fan is

Nick GRINDS the truck into gear

KURT

He sits back Nick leans toward Kurt

NICK
(sotto)
There’s definitely something going
on with Milo

KURT
Right
(then checks watch)
I think we’re okay I think we’re
gonna make it back to Nagopian in
time

OSCAR (0S)
So you’re working for that piece of
crap

The guys jump startled Oscar has regained consciousness
his hands still tied

OSCAR (CONTD)
I should’ve figured

NICK
(re Oscar)
Shit I forgot about him

OSCAR
What I don’t understand is why
would Nagopian hire three putos
like you

KURT
If we’re such putos how did we
steal your truck and knock you out

DALE
Yeah And what’s a puto

Oscar smiles calmly

OSCAR
You have no idea what kind of shit
youre in

NICK
What about you I hate to think
what Nagopian’s going to do to you
when we get there

OSCAR
I’m not worried

DALE
If you’re not worried then why are
you crying
(looking closer)
Oh wait That’s a tattoo

OSCAR

find you and kill you

have a choice

DALE
What do we do with him

OSCAR
You let me go

KURT
We’re not letting you go
(then quietly to Nick)
Should we let him go

Dale leans forward to listen
NICK

I don’t know If we take him to
Nagopian he’1ll probably kill him

KURT
Yeah But if we let him out he’1l
kill us

DALE

How His hands are tied

NICK
They won’t be tied forever Dale
(then)
Maybe we can make a deal with him
We let him go and Nagopian doesn’t
kill him And in return for saving
his life he lets us off the hook

KURT
Seems reasonable
(turning to Oscar)
How does that sound Jeffy

They all look to see the rear truck door is open and Oscar is
gone

KURT (CONTD)
Where did he go

EXT TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

DALE (CONTD)
What is that

NICK
That’s what was in the truck

KURT
(to Nagopian)
Why did you need a bunch of dolls

Nagopian yanks the head off the doll and pulls out a baggie
filled with powder

KURT (CONTD)
Ah Right Drugs of some sort

They shake hands with Nagopian just as a car pulls up driven
by a WOMAN Nagopian hands the Dora doll to Ghoukas who
takes it away

The woman steps out of the car Dale looks at her Why does
she look familiar

MR NAGOPIAN (CONT’D)

Oscar hangs out the passenger window of one car holding a
gun He rides with a half dozen of his tattooed GANG
MEMBERS

DALE
It’s Jeffy

Oscar aims and FIRES his gun narrowly missing them Gravel
flies up beside them

Nagopian’s thug aims his Uzi at the guys but before he can
fire he is SHOT IN THE ARM by one of the Dominicans

Caught in the crossfire our guys duck and scramble for

Nick Kurt and Dale are now at the top floor Nick’s still
on the phone They leave the stairwell and take cover behind
a stack of drywall There are no outside walls or windows
only plastic sheets which flutter in the wind

SFX BEEP

Nick looks at his phone to see an incoming call The caller
ID reads “SKYMALL INC”

NICK
(showing Kurt and Dale)
Guys look

DALE
SkyMall What could they want

KURT
Maybe they had second thoughts
about the Shower Buddy Take it

NICK
Not the best time for a business
call Kurt We’re about to be shot
to death

KURT
Exactly Wouldn’t you rather die
knowing that we’re not just three
idiots who quit their jobs for no
reason

Nick hesitates Kurt grabs the phone from him and answers
the call putting 911 on hold

KURT (CONTD)

(“casually” into phone)
Nickurdale Industries this is
Kurt

CLAIRE (0S)
(on phone)
Kurt hi it’s Claire Robbins from
SkyMall Hope we’re not catching
you too early

KURT
No no this is a great time

BANG A shot overhead showers the guys with drywall pieces
Kurt peeks out from his cover to find Nagopian and Ghoukas
scanning the room for them A piece of plastic blows in from
the wind Ghoukas FIRES at it

MR NAGOPIAN
Were going to find you fuckers

INTERCUT WITH

INT SKY MALL OFFICES - SAME TIME
Claire is on the phone at her desk

CLAIRE
What is that noise

KURT
(quietly)
I’m just down on the factory floor
How can I help you Claire

As Claire speaks the three crawl behind various piles of
construction equipment to avoid being found by the Armenians

CLAIRE
Well despite our misgivings about
you and your colleagues on a
personal level we showed your
Shower Buddy to our boss and she
flipped for it

KURT
(full voice)
Seriously
(to Nick and Dale)
They like the Buddy

BANG Hearing Kurt’s voice Nagopian fires in his direction
Nick Kurt and Dale hustle for a new hiding spot

NICK
(to Kurt)
Shhh

CLAIRE
We do have a couple of questions
though before we can make an
order

KURT
Sure sure That’s great Do you
think we could call you back a
little later in the day

CLAIRE
Unfortunately we go to press on
our fall catalogue today so it’s
kind of a now-or-never situation
That’s why we’re calling so early

KURT
I see Okay well we’ll be happy
to answer your questions--

He peeks out from his hiding spot and sees Oscar and four of
his thugs run in with weapons drawn

KURT (CONTD)
(to himself)
Holy shit

Nagopian and Ghoukas take cover as Oscar and his men turn
their attention to them

OSCAR
You think you can steal from me
pendejo

MR NAGOPIAN
Jaj tam vret

They open fire on each other BANG BANG BANG Kurt Nick
and Dale cower

CLAIRE
Was that gunfire

KURT
Nope Those are bolt guns
They’re shooting bolts into the
thing

CLAIRE

All right well first of all we
need to know if the estimates you
gave us on your maximum output
capacity were theoretical or rated

One of the Arana Pandilla members is SHOT multiple times He
collapses directly over where Kurt is hiding dropping his
gun and BLEEDING DOWN ONTO KURT’S HEAD

KURT

(reacting)
Ugghhh

(then keeping it

together)
Those estimates were rated based
on actual productivity figures over
a two week period-- Pfft

Kurt spits blood out of his mouth that has dripped down from
the fallen gang member above him

CLAIRE )
Okay good And tell me about your
replenishment lead time

More of Nagopian’s men have joined the battle on the top
floor It’s an all-out gang war

Struggling to see despite the blood that has dripped into his
eyes Kurt spots an Armenian THUG heading in his direction

KURT
(spits more blood)
Pfft I’m gonna hand you over to
my co-CEO Nick He can tell you
all about our
(loudly for Nick’s sake)
replenishment lead time

Kurt tosses the phone to Nick and scrambles for cover on his
hands and knees As Nick speaks he “army crawls” under a
tarp

NICK
Hi Claire As far as our RLT
goes our assembly line can produce
75 completed units per hour so we
can meet any orders with a minimum
of lead time--

BANG A bullet rips through the tarp just over Nick He
flinches

CLAIRE
Is everything okay there

NICK
Everything’s just f--UCK

Nick holds up his left hand which we see has a BULLET HOLE IN
IT

CLAIRE
Excuse me

Freaking out Nick spots Dale hiding nearby

NICK
(pained)
I’m gonna transfer you to my
colleague Dale DALE

Nick throws the phone at Dale and grabs his hand in agony

DALE
(into phone)
Dale here

CLAIRE
Um hello I was just going to ask
if your manufacturing cycle
efficiency matches the throughput
estimates from your production spec
sheet

Dale hasn’t the slightest idea what Claire’s talking about

DALE
(after a beat)
Yes

CLAIRE
That’s all we needed to know
Welcome to the SkyMall family

DALE
Thanks lady

Claire shrugs and hangs up Dale pumps his fist
victoriously

DALE (CONTD)
Guys we did it

He looks over at Kurt who is disgustedly wiping blood from
his face then at Nick who is frantically wrapping his bloody
hand

DALE (CONTD)
Whoa Are you okay

NICK
No I’m not okay I got shot in
the fucking hand

KURT
I swallowed gangster blood
(noticing)
Oh shit

They turn to see Oscar stalking straight toward them his gun
drawn

OSCAR
And now you learn what happens when
you kidnap the head of the Arafia P--

BLAM A bullet blasts right through Oscar’s head
SPLATTERING ONLY KURT’S FACE WITH BLOOD

KURT
Ugghh With the blood Pfft

Oscar falls revealing Nagopian standing behind him his own
gun drawn

DALE
You saved our lives

MR NAGOPIAN
I was aiming at you He got in the
way

DALE
(disappointed)
Oh

Nagopian takes aim directly at Dale Dale cringes Nick
spots a wheelbarrow filled with POWDERED CONCRETE He grabs
a handful and TOSSES it into Nagopian’s face momentarily
blinding him

NICK
(clutching his wounded and
now concrete caked hand)
Ow

KURT
Come on

They take off running in the direction of the stairs but stop
when they see Ghoukas blocking their path

NICK
Ghoukas

They head off in another direction By now Nagopian has
recovered and is hunting them down

Our guys find themselves at the edge of the building with a
HUNDRED FOOT DROP IN FRONT OF THEM

DALE
It’s a dead end

NICK
There’s no way down

KURT
Wait look

Kurt points to a construction debris chute (like a
waterslide) that leads to a dumpster below

NICK
Are you kidding We wouldn’t
survive that

KURT
Sure we will It’s just like the
slides at Raging Waters

NICK
Yeah if those slides ended in a
dumpster full of sharp metal
Nagopian and Ghoukas are closing in

KURT
Well I’m going

Kurt jumps feet first into the slide and disappears Nick
and Dale look at each other for a beat Dale shrugs and
jumps into the slide

Nick sighs

NICK
God damn it

He follows his friends down the chute

INT DEBRIS CHUTE - CONTINUOUS
Kurt BARRELS down the dusty slide

KURT
WHOAAAAHHHHH

Right behind him Dale speeds along

DALE
AHHHHHHHHHHHA

Bringing up the rear is Nick

NICK
SHHHIIIIIIIT

From Kurt’s POV we see the bottom of the chute rapidly
approaching A LONG SHARP piece of REBAR juts into the
slide pointing directly up toward Kurt’s oncoming testicles

KURT
Oh fuck

He desperately splays out his legs and hands slowing himself
down on the walls of the chute He manages to stop his
descent a MERE FOOT from the pointy end of the steel bar

UNTIL DALE SLAMS INTO HIM from behind shoving him six inches
closer to the bar

KURT (CONTD) DALE
Ahh Oof

Just then Nick SLIDES INTO THE TWO OF THEM shoving Kurt’s
crotch down to within AN INCH of being impaled

Kurt takes a deep breath then kicks the rebar to the side

EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - MOMENTS LATER

Filthy bloody and exhausted the three guys climb out of the
dumpster only to find a half dozen GUNS pointed at them

MAN (0S)
Freeze

The guys realize they are surrounded by COPS including
Hagan A couple SWAT team vans unload and take up positions
around the building
HAGAN
So you dildos werent bullshitting

He gestures for the cops to lower their guns
steps up to Hagan

OFFICER

NICK
Think you have enough evidence on
him now Detective

Hagan gives him a look

HAGAN
You guys okay

KURT
Yeah
(re the blood crusted on
his face)
Think I could get an AIDS test

Nick’s cell phone rings It’s SkyMall again

NICK
