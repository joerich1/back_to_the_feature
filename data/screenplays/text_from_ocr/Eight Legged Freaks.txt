PIG PEN
I will not fear the unexpected

The rabbit appears in the road frozen by headlights

bunny

EXT HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT

The truck slews crazily Missing the bunny by a whisker

INT THIRD TRUCK (BRIDGE DESERT) - NIGHT

Pig Pen sees a bridge ahead If he doesnt regain

control he will crash At the last second he gets the

rig together

EXT BRIDGE (DESERT) - THIRD TRUCK - NIGHT

The rim of a wheel tags the curb One of those toxic

waste barrels falls out of the back and plunges to the

water below

EXT DRAINAGE DITCH - NIGHT

A biohazard warning label is legible as the barrel slips

beneath the surface Glowing toxic waste seeps from a

gash in its side Spreading through the pool like neon

ink

EXT DRAINAGE DITCH - DAY

The ditch is littered with garbage The DRONE of
INSECTS No visible traces of toxic waste A butterfly
net sweeps through the air to capture an oversized
horsefly

JOSHUA TAFT (70s) scrutinizes the bug This old codger
is more comfortable studying bugs than socializing with
people

JOSHUA
Hey Mike Check this one out
MIKE PALMER steps over for a look Puberty hit hard

and fast for this bright little nerd

MIKE
Hes huge

JOSHUA
Theyve been like this all week
Must be something extra tasty in
the water

MIKE
Like what

JOSHUA
Dead coyote Snake maybe Back
in the Nam wed eat python with a
dash of habanero sauce Mighty
satisfying

MIKE
You ate snake

JOSHUA
When youre thirty klicks out from
the nearest firebase Humpin
through the wake-up with your
finger on the trigger Charlie
doesnt give you time to stop for
cutlet

As Mike skims his own net over the water he glimpses a
familiar barrel at the bottom of the pool The brightly-
colored biohazard warning label is clearly visible
EXT ROAD - JOSHUAS HOUSE - DAY

Two bicycles are parked outside a cabin in the middle of
nowhere

INT JOSHUAS HOUSE - DAY

The decor is an odd mix of Vietnam era war relics and
homegrown scientist Charlie the Parrot sits on a perch

CHARLIE (VO)
Charlie dont surf

JOSHUA
Quiet bird Were working

Mike and Joshua stand near the spider tanks A dozen
aquariums on low shelves Each glass tank replicates a
specific environment jungle desert cavern pond etc

JOSHUA
(dims tank lights)
The sun is going down my
nocturnal hunters Its time to
come out and feed

Mike watches Joshua deposit bugs into each spider tank

MIKE
Yeah Theyre definitely getting
bigger
JOSHUA

Ive calculated a growth factor of
twelve percent over the last
forty-eight hours But that seems
to be accelerating

MIKE
All from eating these bugs Maybe
I should try some

Mike pauses at the desert tank watching a cricket search
for food A trap-door spider pops out of its camouflaged
den like a jack-in-the-box The arachnid yanks the
cricket below and replaces the roof in a nanosecond

Mike looks in another tank where ogre-eyed spitting
spiders shoot blasts of paralyzing goo at hapless
insects

MIKE
Run little guys

JOSHUA
They cant outrun the food chain

MIKE
I could get away

JOSHUA
Imagine yourself the size of that
fly A scytodes spitter would be
as big as a Cadillac Youd be
spider chow kid

Mike looks in a tank where jumpers chase fleeing
crickets He moves toward another tank that is covered
with a towel

MIKE
Are the new tarantulas in here

JOSHUA
Took me forever to get a breeding
set of Chilean reds I must have
bribed every customs agent from
Vegas to Santiago

Joshua unveils the tank Dirt floor Several burrow
entrances Joshua pours in the bugs A large male
tarantula comes out of a burrow It pounces on a bug
then wraps its prey in webbing turning the insect into a

mummy-like bundle

MIKE
That is too cool

JOSHUA
Male tarantulas compete for the
females attention
(MORE)

JOSHUA (CONTD)
Each one tries to bring her the
best present Bugs rats even
the occasional parrot

CHARLIE SQUAWKS

JOSHUA
The prey is cocooned alive so she
can eat them in her nest You
know how women love breakfast in
bed

Joshua leads Mike to the back of the tank A network of
subterranean tunnels is revealed The male tarantulas
scuttle through carrying their mummified offerings

JOSHUA
Take a look the female of the
species is three times as big as
the male

Mike peers into a large den The female tarantula steps
out of the shadows This is Consuela the Chilean red
tarantula

JOSHUA
Say hello to Consuela

Mike watches Consuela unwrap one of the mummified
bundles She begins to eat the paralyzed insect within

JOSHUA
She fills her prey with digestive
acid to liquify the internal
organs Now watch Shell drink
her victim from the inside out
While its still alive

MIKE
(looks queasy)
And you wonder why my mom doesnt
like me hanging out with you

JOSHUA
Arachnids have been roaming the
earth for millions of years And
theyll be here long after the
human race is dead and buried
Suddenly Consuela lunges at the glass Mike recoils

MIKE
Bad Bad Consuela

Consuela backs up apparently she can be intimidated

TARANTULA POV - MIKE

The multi-eyed spiders PANORAMIC VISION Mike looms
large at the edge of the glass wagging his finger
BACK TO MIKE

Mike stares into the many eyes of Consuela

MIKE
Do that again and I feed you to
the parrot

CHARLIE SQUAWKS hungrily The sound of a CAR HORN

JOSHUA
Theres your mom

MIKE
See you tomorrow Joshua

Rotten beams Chipped walls A GENERATOR POWERS a
string of lightbulbs A lone figure works at the end of

the tunnel

CHRIS McCORMICK (30s) has rugged good looks Weathered
clothing Dirt-stained face Ripped muscles

Chris chips at the wall with his pickaxe As it makes
contact the occasional spark flies up Chris pauses to
scrutinize the target area with his helmet-light

Something sneaks along the floor of the mine behind him

Chris is oblivious to his unseen stalker He chips away
a section of stone to reveal shiny minerals Reflections
of silver and gold splash across his face His smile
fades

CHRIS
Damn

Chris bends over reaching for a bottle of water A
large rat scurries out of hiding dragging away Chriss
sack lunch

Chris grabs his pick-axe and goes after the rat The
rodent dodges every hit Sparks fly when the axe strikes
rock These ignite a vent of methane gas

A BRIEF EXPLOSION knocks Chris off his feet He notices
a small hole in the floor is lit like the burner on a
stove Chris pats out the flame as the rat scurries away
with lunch

CHRIS
Hope you like bologna

cascades down her face Her eyes close She is

oblivious to a small spider crossing a web in front of
her The spider gets clear as Ashley rinses off the
soap

Ashley rubs conditioner into her hair The lather
builds Covering her face Forcing her eyes closed once
more The spider returns across its web right in front
of her eyes

The water stops Ashley reaches for the showerhead
blindly knocking the spider off its web She feels no
water coming out and fumbles for a washcloth Reaching
with eyes closed she cant see the little spider has
landed on top of the cloth As Ashley retrieves it the
spider scurries onto its opposite side

Ashley wipes the soap off her face The spider rides the
washcloth and moves toward her hand Before it can
strike Ashley gets her eyes clear and drops the cloth

The cloth lands on the floor atop the spider As the
beast stares out from under it barefoot Ashley steps on
the cloth Crushing the spider without ever knowing it
was there

the water handles trying to get the water flowing again
The handles suddenly pop off Dozens of tiny spiders
pour from the holes onto the floor Ashley shrieks in

spiders

she puts the end of the hose in her mouth and sucks
deeply trying to siphon away the blockage

And another A dozen things pump through the hose and
into her mouth

grabs a frying pan and smashes it across the face as she
stumbles backward The spider reels striking the burner
knobs turning on the gas

back toward the fuse box and makes a run for it As she
goes the tarantula fires a webline at her

fuse She turns toward the kitchen just in time to see

Youre okay
GLADYS

Im not in heaven

CHRIS
No

GLADYS
Then whats with all the gold

Gladys points behind Chriss head to the wall of the
cavern The group turns their lights on it The
reflection is dazzling Veins of gold criss-cross the
cavern walls

WADE
Gold Gold Look Its
everywhere

SAM
Is it real

Chris checks it out
CHRIS

Jesus its the mother lode

He was right My dad was right

Chris helps Gladys to her feet They share an emotional
look of recognition

GLADYS
So were you

Wade chips away at the gold

WADE
Get as much as you can

Bret looks at Ashley

BRET
Nice work Doc

Ashley acknowledges him Bret chips gold with Wade
puts her hand on Ashleys shoulder

SAM
You saved my life

Ashley smiles
Gladys leans over to Norman

GLADYS
Have you got a smoke kid

NORMAN
The man says this cavern is full
of highly flammable methane gas
I smoke to get high not to die

SAM
Spiders

The group sees a cluster of normal-sized tarantulas
scuttling out of the shadows

NORMAN
Whats the big deal

Sam

Norman steps on the closest one grinding it under his

boot He stomps around crushing as many as he can

Mike watches this curiously Taking a look at one of the

squashed bodies

MIKE
I think you should stop
NORMAN
Why

MIKE
They dont have hair They arent
fully grown tarantulas

Chris and Sam look over

MIKE
Theyre giant babies

Norman freezes He hears SOMETHING MOVING around in the
dark And then a spine chilling GROWL

Chris reacts to the noise He can guess whats coming

The FEMALE TARANTULA steps out of the shadows Consuela
has grown to be as big as a Volkswagen MicroBus By far
the largest spider weve seen yet Covered in hair
Massive eyes Her two fangs are the size of machetes

Mikes eyes go wide at the sight of his old nemesis

MIKE
Consuela

CHRIS
Consuela

The fur on Consuelas back seems to undulate There is
something weird there A lot of weird things In

fact her entire back is littered with hundreds of baby
tarantulas

As Consuela advances she flicks several dart-sized
quills off her belly right into Norman A dark stain
spreads across the drug dealers shirt

NORMAN
Bummer

Consuela pierces Norman with her fangs holding him
tight Babies flood of her back and onto the doper
chewing him to pieces like ravenous piranhas
CHRIS
Go

The group flees toward the opposite end of the cavern
male tarantula drops down to block their escape Sam
BLOWS it away Wade and Bret are still chipping away
bits of gold

CHRIS
Leave it

WADE
So you can keep it all Hell no

Wade gets a nugget off the wall He only has a
nanosecond to admire it before Consuela suddenly looms
behind him

BRET
Dad

Bret reaches out toward his father Wade reaches for
him Consuelas fangs suddenly protrude from Wades
chest and hes hauled backward The tarantula flings
Wade into the cave

CHRIS
Bret come on

Bret runs after the others But he sees Consuela firing
more quills at the group Directly at Ashley Bret
leaps into harms way Hes turned into a pin cushion

ASHLEY
Bret
Ashley goes to his side
BRET
Im sorry I
Bret dies Sam drags Ashley away from him

INT MINES - NIGHT
The survivors flee along the tunnel Chris jumps up to
rip down the string of light bulbs from the ceiling

SAM
We have to get out

CHRIS
This is our chance to kill them
all

Chris smashes the bulb at the end of the strand
CHRIS

When the power comes on the bulb
will ignite the methane and torch

them
SAM
Where did you get an idea like
that
Chris looks at Gladys
GLADYS

I blew up the kitchen

CHRIS
Keep going up the tunnel There
should be a generator at the exit
Start it up and await for my
signal to throw the switch

SAM
And the toxic waste

CHRIS
Will be buried under tons of rock
Go

SAM

What about you

CHRIS
I need to set the fuse as close to
the spiders as I can That should
give us time to get clear

Sam and Chris share a brief beat And then Chris pulls
down the lights dragging them back toward the
tarantulas den

SAM
He has a cute butt Dont you
think

GLADYS

USDA choice

INT MINES - TARANTULA DEN - NIGHT
Chris comes through with his light bulb fuse Consuela
and her babies are feasting on the bodies of Bret and

it to identify a faint draft

CHRIS
Bingo

He positions the shattered light bulb beside this gas
jet

Mike helps Gladys up the tunnel Sam and Ashley are
behind Suddenly a male tarantula steps out of the
shadows separating the groups

MIKE

SAM
Keep going

Sam and Ashley flee down another tunnel

Chris bails out of the cavern and starts running

INT MINE TUNNELS - NIGHT

Sam and Ashley flee the male tarantula Sam stumbles
over something on the ground Its Bret Hales lost
motorcycle Ashley looks back and sees the tarantula
coming after them

ASHLEY
Hurry

Sam lifts the MOTORCYCLE upright and climbs on She
STARTS it and REVS the ENGINE Ashley leaps aboard Sam
accelerates along the shaft away from the spider The
bikes headlight illuminates their path

The male tarantula scurries after the bike

Sam rides the motorcycle along the shaft Ashley hangs

on tight Theyve put some distance between themselves
and the male tarantula A dead-end looms before them
Ashley screams as her mom stops on a dime and does a 180
Sam rides back the way they came heading straight toward
the male tarantula Ashley looks over her mothers
shoulder at the giant spider coming in the opposite

direction

ASHLEY
Oh shit

Sam lifts the bike into a wheelie as the tarantula nears
SAM
Banzai

With perfect timing she brings the front wheel down hard
onto the tarantulas back Crunch The spider is
roadkill Sam steers them down another tunnel

EXT MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADES RANCH - DAWN

Mike and Gladys gather at a generator just shy of the
tunnel exit Mike tries to start the generator It

wont catch

MIKE
It needs gas

GLADYS

Gladys heads over toward Wades ranch

INT MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

Chris runs along the tunnel Consuela charges after him

ASHLEY
Yo Mom

Sam turns as Ashley throws her the STUN GUN Sam catches
it and brings it down to the light bulb cable ZAPPING
it

INT MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

As Chris runs the light bulbs illuminate sequentially
traveling past him into the cavern

INT MINE TUNNEL - DAWN

A broken light bulb sparks The filament ignites the

gas-filled tunnel A ball of flame spreads throughout
the mines
INT MINES - TARANTULA DEN - DAWN
A huge column of flame blasts into the chamber All the

gold is illuminated Consuelas babies are burned like
popcorn

EXT MINE TUNNEL EXIT - NEAR WADES RANCH - DAY
Sam looks back to see Chris running toward her Consuela
is on his heels The glow of a fireball is right behind

them

SAM
Come on

Chris looks over his shoulder at Consuela and the flames

SAM
Chris

Chris makes it to Sam just ahead of the conflagration

EXT DESERT - NEAR WADES RANCH - DAY

Sam and Chris dive out of the mine opening A pillar of
flame shoots out behind them Ashley and Mike are
nearby The town is visible just a mile away

EXT TOWN - DAY

The spiders retreat from daylight Scuttling back into
the buildings Heading down into the mine shafts

INT VARIOUS MINE TUNNELS - DAY

The chain reaction spreads through the mines Jets of
flame blast up tunnels

Torching any unlucky spiders looking for a home
Rupturing the very earth around them

EXT DESERT - NEAR WADES RANCH - DAY

The EARTH BEGINS TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY
ASHLEY
Earthquake

CHRIS
No Its a chain reaction The
whole valley is going to blow

MIKE
Well never get out in time

Gladys drives up in Wades humvee Cigar in mouth

GLADYS
Lets get the fuck out of here

The survivors pile into the truck as the town begins to
BLOW UP in the distance

Chris is just about to climb aboard when A webline
shoots out of the nearby mine shaft Consuela lives
The spider is charred and bloody But shes primed for
revenge

Chris is yanked off his feet and hauled toward her
fumbles for his machete and hacks at the webline
Cutting himself free just before getting impaled on
Consuelas fangs

Consuela knocks away Chriss machete and lunges down at
him Chris kicks her belly with both his feet Consuela
begins to shudder Jagged cracks appear in her charred
carapace Chris kicks and tears at the failing armor
He thinks hes harming the tarantula but hes actually
helping it

Mike and the others watch from the humvee

MIKE
Oh no shes molting

Consuelas blistered shell cracks as she shrugs the
damaged skin away from her body Chris is amazed to see
the spider has grown a full size larger and become
totally rejuvenated

Consuela comes after Chris He defends himself with the

He
machete

Shining steel makes contact with the dripping fangs
Once again Consuela punts away the machete She prepares
the death blow It looks like curtains for Chris

MIKE
Consuela No Bad Bad
Consuela
The massive spider stops in shock Chris looks back to
see Mike has returned
TARANTULA POV
The familiar multi-perspective spider vision The

tarantula seems to recognize Mike

BACK TO MIKE
He throws his Cassiopeia PDA at the spiders face
Chris uses this moment of confusion to grab his machete
and drive it deep into the spiders unprotected
abdomen

The tarantula screams

Chris leaps up and runs scooping up Mike They dive
into the back of the humvee

Consuela tries to follow but is mortally wounded She
collapses in the dust The TOWN EXPLODES in the bg
The earth itself begins to collapse

INT HUMVEE - DRIVING ACROSS DESERT - DAY

Gladys accelerates as the town sinks in the distance
BUILDINGS EXPLODE Jets of flame burst upward The mall
is sucked into the widening pit of collapsing earth The
humvee is just a cart length ahead of a wave of crumbling
desert

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

The humvee reaches open road The survivors watch out
the back as Prosperity disappears into a massive
sinkhole

EXT HIGHWAYINT HUMVEE - MOVING - DAY

The group sits in a long beat of abject shock And then
Chris looks down to see his tight pants have finally
ripped

CHRIS
I really need some pants that fit

The group smiles Happy to be alive

MIKE
Look out

Everyone looks to the road ahead A familiar bunny
rabbit hops across the highway Gladys HONKS and swerves
to avoid it
EXT HIGHWAY - DAY
The bunny gets clear as the humvee drives away toward
safety

The rabbit continues its trek for a moment and then is
grabbed by a large trap-door spider

FADE OUT

THE END
