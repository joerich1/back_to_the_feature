foodstuffs and walks to the open area of the car She starts
tossing them out the door

Ruth does not relish the idea of going so close to the edge but
she steels herself and looks out and sees the hungry faces of
poor black families and migrant workers who are waiting
anxiously for Idgie’s gifts

IDGIZE

Yes but this food isn’t yours to give

IDGIE
That’s Church talk Well I’ve seen

giving me the strength to take it And
I remembered thanking the Lord for each
day my mother lived even when she was
spitting up blood and crying for me to
kill her I looked at my mother’s
eyes pleading with me to help her and
all I could do was pray

(to Idgie)
When you were gone as I was holding
Buddy I thought if that bastard Frank
Bennett ever tries to take ny child
away I won’t pray I11 kill hin

woman running around and the next day I
was just full of liver spots and
walking like molasses going up hill in

approaches Ninny who is crying and holding a small shoe box
and tending to the few remaining roses in her garden Evelyn
puts her arms around Ninny and hugs her

NINNY
Hi Evelyn Somebody stole my house
It was right here when I left Uniless-
(she grabs Evelyn’s hand)
Oh Evelyn you don’t reckon I’m crazy
do you This is the Place it used to
be

Evelyn hugs her again

YN
No honey You’re not crazy This is
the place

NINNY
Who would want to steal an old lady’s
house It wasn’t worth anything

EVELYN
Nobody stole it honey They had to
tear it down--it was condemned I’m
sorry I should have told you before
I was going to

Ninny turns and looks at the empty lot

NINNY
Cleo built that house for me when we
were just married--and now it’s gone
Eighty three years worth of living and
all that’s left of me is just what’s in
this box a bunch of old cards and
pictures

FGT JA March 19 1991

Ninny points at a tombstone which reads “Ruth Jameson Born
1903-Died 1939 Gone but not Forgotten There’s some
wildflowers and a note resting in the shade below the stone
Evelyn picks up the note revealing a small jar of honey She
Opens the note and reads it 7-q) always love you the
beecharmer Evelyn smiles to herself ana then notices Ninny
walking out of the cemetery towards the town of Whistle Stop

EVELYN
Idgie

Ninny instinctively turns her head ang smiles at Evelyn who

shakes her head for a second and then scurries after her Fron

the distance we can see Evelyn approach Ninny

EVELYN
Idgie’s still alive

NINNY
Yes

EVELYN
Why didn’t you tell ne

NINNY
You didn’t ask She’s out there
Sonewhere running free charming bees
and selling honey Every once in
awhile I’11 catch a hint of her
Maybe we’11 see her one day soon

EVELYN
Oh You’ve been holding out on me
haven’t you Let’s go home and then
you’ll have to tell me everything

Arm in arn they walk through the dilapidated remains of the
town of Whistle Stop Evelyn starts asking Ninny all the
questions that now come to her mind about Idgie’s life tHE
CAMERA RISES UP AND FOLLOWS them into the town as we hear the
voices from the past echo through this repository of memories
until we again hear the ghost train’s whistle and the clatter
of its wheels as it approaches the town The Ted leaves of
fall start blowing in the wind as the train noise crescendoes
And again no train actually appears

NINNY (V0)

After Ruth died and the railroads
stopped running and the cafe shut

down everybody just scattered to the
winds It was never more than just a
little knockabout Place but now that I
look back on it when that cafe closed
the heart of the town just stopped
beating It is funny how a little
Place like this brought so many people
together

FGT JA March 19 1991

THE CAMERA CRANES DOWN past Ninny and Evelyn as they walk
through the town THE CAMERA CONTINUES over the vines of the
kudzu until it comes to rest on a faded sign that says Fried
Green Tomatoes served at the Whistle Stop Cafe

THE END
