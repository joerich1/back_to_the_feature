EXT MOUNT VERNON BALTIMORE - SEPTEMBER 17 1984 - DAY

Framed in a blue sky a marble effigy of GEORGE WASHINGTON is
perched atop a stone-white column above red-brick row-houses

Beneath FRANK CORDEN (mid 20s curly hair cut into a
preppier ‘do) does his door-to-door civic duty

COURTNEY (30s box-blonde mother of three B’more accent)
answers his knock with a KENT ULTRA pinched in her fingers

FRANK
Good morning Miss Can I trouble
you for a moment of your time

COURTNEY
Oh Jesus not another one I bought
an electric cheese grater from you
people Thing broke a‘soon as I
stuck in the Muenster

FRANK
You sound pretty ‘ungrateful’

He likes his joke much more than she does

COURTNEY
Whadderya sellin’ You got a minute
Card Sharks is in commercial

FRANK
I’m actually not a salesman Miss
I was wondering if you’re currently
registered to vote

COURTNEY
Not interested

She tries to close the door Frank gives it a stiff-arm

FRANK
You really should be

COURTNEY
Eh politicians are all the same

FRANK
That’s not true Perhaps if you
knew more about the candidates--

COURTNEY
I know about the candidates Reagan
did that movie where he was talkin’
to a monkey

(MORE)
Frank was waiting for that question He’s so
speech it sounds new even for the hundredth

COURTNEY (CONTD)
That’s weird a president talkin’
to a monkey It’s unnatural And
the Mondale guy you can’t say it
but I will pussy

FRANK
Well he’s certainly a little
skittish on foreign policy

COURTNEY
Big fat pussy Betcha growin’ up he
got his ass kicked likeevery
day By like girls and stuff Those
are my choices why should I vote

FRANK
Because voting is sacred Because
everything this country is about
started with the right to be heard
Our parents and grandparents and
great-great-grandparents fought and
died for that right Where do your
ancestors come from

COURTNEY
(big nicotine exhale)
Down’a street

FRANK
Well I’m sure I’11 talk to them in
a minute then Miss there are
people just like you in Russia
China East Germany and around the
world who would give everything for
the control that you have over how
your country is run I’m not here
to say you have to vote Miss I’m
here to celebrate that you get to

Courtney takes a pensive drag from the cigarette

COURTNEY
I can sign up with you

FRANK
Absolutely

He hands her a clipboard and a pen

good at
time

this
FRANK (CONTD)
And if I may
(reading her name)
Courtney I’d like to encourage you
to reelect President Ronald Reagan

COURTNEY
Nah I’m votin’ for the pussy That
monkey shit really creeps me out

She hands back the clipboard and shuts the door Frank
chooses to still count it as a victory

Cue Johnny Cash’s cover of ‘PERSONAL JESUS’ as Frank
continues down the long street of identical row-houses He
knocks on doors Same smile same speech Some sign up some
don’t Neither fazes Frank He believes in his mission

INT FRANK’S CAR - LATER

A shitbox ‘81 HYUNDAI PONY The passenger seat is covered in
stacked registration CLIPBOARDS Styrofoam BURGER BOXES and
a MOUTHWASH BOTTLE Frank takes a sip of mouthwash spits it
back into a McDonald’s cup No time for real hygiene

Frank pilots this deathtrap down I-95 toward WASHINGTON DC

INT REAGAN CAMPAIGN OFFICE GEORGETOWN - DAY

Frank carefully prints names on COFFEE CUPS with a sharpie
Pours each to order with the right cream and sugar levels

Campaign posters adorn the walls as busy VOLUNTEERS hum with
the lines read verbatim from cold-calling scripts ‘Have you
considered’ ‘Are you better off now’ ‘Continuing progress’

Frank glides through the phone banks handing out
personalized pick-me-ups to each volunteer

The last is his least favorite to give labeled ‘KARL’

INT CAMPAIGN OFFICE - PRIVATE OFFICE

The eponymous KARL (30s suspenders punchable face) squeezes
a HAND GRIP while sticking BLUE PINS in a map of the state of
Maryland Frank sets his coffee on his desk

KARL
Look at this Frankie It’s an ass-
kicking in progress Whole country’s

FRANK
We’re red now Democrats are blue

KARL
Bullshit they’re blue Red’s the
Commie color They’re ourCommies

FRANK
Well they’re in disguise then You

FRANK

two hundred new voters

KARL

And forty of them are voting for
Mondale Signing up Bad Guys

total of

(checking a sheet)
--Could Be Better

FRANK
Karl you can’t do that I need to
get credit for my work

KARL
You want credit Frankie you’re on
the wrong Hill

Frank scowls at Karl in what seems like a daily occurrence
He storms out of the office Karl calls after him

KARL (CONTD)
Gonna need to get those stats up
Frankie The Good Guys are blue

INT CAMPAIGN OFFICE - NOVEMBER 6 1984

The office buzzes again this time with jubilant celebration
as the television announces good news And DAN RATHER

DAN RATHER
And I’m getting word that CBS News
can confirm the projection of a
victory for the incumbent
President Ronald Wilson Reagan

The primitive graphics color states in for Reaganin RED

DAN RATHER (CONTD)
And it’s looking like a landslide
A venerable sea of red

Karl locks eyes with a celebrating Frank who mouths the word
‘Red’ to his adversary Karl responds with a finger

INT CAPITOL HILL OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - DECEMBER 1 1984

A stark waiting room egg-white other than the dark wood

Treasury We go way back At Yale

prostitute Two for one deal if

He laughs as only old white dudes can Frank tries to match
his ‘Hahs’ and ‘Ho ho whoas”

PAYNE (CONTD)
Yessir Married that woman Gave me
three wonderful kids

FRANK
Oh well that’sthat’s beautiful

PAYNE

artistic threshold

But instead of turning into a
truck he turns into a table Ora
ball on the ground

BRANDON
Mom I’m a table

MARCY
The boy thinks he’s a table who am
I to argue with him

Frank almost admires the kid’s commitment

FRANK
All the time he’s doing this

MARCY
Until he forgets and wants to be He-
Man instead That’s how kids work
you need to operate in the realm of
their reality

FRANK
Works on adults too

MARCY
(checking her watch)
Okay we’re good
(to Brandon)

JACK
Terrific Frank All-time great I
remember early in the season we’re
playing Cleveland at home Frank

JACK (CONTD)
Robinson just hammers one and-- you
know that flag The one in the
ballpark that says ‘HERE’ That’s
where Robinson put the ball onto
33rd Street Can you believe it
Out of the stadium onto the street

FRANK
And that’s why you named me after
Frank Robinson

JACK
Only because your Mom wouldn’t let
me name you Brooks

GLADYS
(laughing)
That’s not a man’s name It’s not

The mood lightens Frank has saved another family dinner

CASPAR
Then have him write a-fucking-

pleading with President RONALD REAGAN (73 he’s Reagan)

BUD
Mr President we have to do the
Oath again For the public

REAGAN
Mark was fine Don’t tell me the

The word echoes in Frank’s mind He suddenly recalls his
brother’s speech about the commercial

FRANK

He slams the door Karl trips over himself down the hall

KARL
Goddamn it we gotta find Mark

FRANK

Or he could fix this He nervously knocks on the door It

across from Frank who holds the list from Poindexter

PEGGY
This is the United Nations so I’d
like to keep the President’s
language firm but respectful They
probably told you to tell me to kick
Russia in the ass a little right

Frank sees a small opportunity to quietly make a difference

FRANK
Actually they suggested we soften
the rhetoric on Russia a bit The
President always talks about ‘Peace
Through Strength’ The whole first
term was mostly just the latter To
quote the prophet John Lennon
let’s give peace a chance

PEGGY
They want to soften the rhetoric
(off his nod)
What’s your position again

FRANK
I’m a media consultant I help the
Presidentbe Presidential

Peggy studies Frank for a second Then

PEGGY
Okay But we can’t say ‘Lennon’
he’1l think we mean ‘Vladimir’

FRANK
I have a suspicion that he won’t
but better safe than sorry
(then)
Hey can I ask you a question

She looks at him which causes Frank to change his inquiry

FRANK (CONTD)
How is ‘Peggy’ short for ‘Margaret’
There’s no P in Margaret

Peggy holds steely eye contact She knows what he’s asking

PEGGY
There’s no B in ‘William’ but I
know plenty of ‘Bills’

POINDEXTER
It’s not in their blood They’re

FRANK

POINDEXTER
You’re not here to hope You’re not
here to think You’re here to translate
the message into a language the
President understands Is that clear

FRANK
Absolutely Mr Poindexter

POINDEXTER
And he better be ready This isn’t a
speech It’s a meeting with the other
most powerful man in the world

FRANK
I went over the talking points with
him sir Peggy even scripted his
first line

POINDEXTER
What about after the first line

Frank is saved from coming up with an answer by Reagan

REAGAN
Love the opener Frank It’s one of
those goosebump moments
(to Poindexter)
You know why they call it that

POINDEXTER
(no hint of a smile)
Because it gives you goosebumps

REAGAN
You got it Charlie
(to Frank)

GORBACHEV
Mr President

REAGAN
Ernie

He gives him a way-too-friendly handshake and hug

FRANK (0S)
We’re rolling

REAGAN
Oh right um

The Soviet detail looks incredibly confused Reagan recovers

REAGAN (CONTD)
The United States and the Soviet
Union are the two greatest
countries on Earth The
superpowers They are the only ones
who can start World War Three but
also the only two countries that
could bring peace to the world

GORBACHEV
And it is our solemn duty to
achieve that peace in our time

They sit down on a couch The summit is on

Mr President the Soviet Union is
very concerned about the presence
of Pershing II missiles in Germany

REAGAN
We’re just protecting ourselves
Mr Gorbashiv
(breaking character)
Ah it’s GorbaCHEV Let me take
that again

He leaves the couch Frank and Poindexter’s hearts stop

POINDEXTER
What’s he doing What’s in god’s
name is he doing

Reagan walks back into the scene

REAGAN
(to himself)
Two three and
(then)
Mr Gorbachev The missiles are
there merely for defense

GORBACHEV
The same was true of our arsenal in
Cuba and yet you refer to that time
as a ‘Crisis’

REAGAN

Well Cuba’s a lot closer to Miami
than Berlin is to your doorstep
It’s dimple sistance

(breaking character)
Dimple sistance You listen to me
I’m a mess today

(quickly to Gorbachev)
Marty was brilliant by the way

He gets up again Gorbachev is baffled

GORBACHEV
Marty

Behind him one KGB Operative leans to another

KGB OPERATIVE
Find this Marty

Poindexter is in full blown panic mode
POINDEXTER
I’m pulling him out

FRANK
Wait sir I have an idea

POINDEXTER
I don’t give a damn We’re done

Reagan approaches them Cheerily

REAGAN
Sorry I hope we’re good on time

POINDEXTER
Mr President I’m afraid we’re--

FRANK

(to Reagan)
Look don’t worry if you stutter or
flub something Just improvise
Talk to him like he’s just a guy
not likethe actual leader of
Soviet Russia Okay Just another
guy from a small town

REAGAN
Ah Verite

FRANK
Very verite Extremely verite

He heads back into the room Poindexter fumes

POINDEXTER
You little shit We should never
have brought you into this

FRANK
Come on Ronnie Verite

Reagan returns to an equally steamed Gorbachev

GORBACHEV
Mr President your cheap
negotiation ploys are wearing thin

REAGAN
I don’t mean any offense Where are
you from in Russia

GORBACHEV
You’ve never heard of it

REAGAN
I was born in Tampico Illinois
Grew up in plenty of little hamlets
that no one’s ever heard of either
And now here we are a couple of
guys from Nowhere talking about the
fate of the world

Poindexter and Frank both exhale That was great

GORBACHEV
Privolnoye 3350 people
(with a smile)
Roads aren’t even paved
(then)
The Soviet Union does not want war

REAGAN
Well then Mr Gorbachev that’s a
good place to start

LATER Reagan and Gorbachev discuss in the background Frank
is on the sideline next to one of the KGB OPERATIVES

FRANK
I mean I know my parents are proud
of me But I want to impress them
Thats different You know

KGB OPERATIVE
(expressionless)
My parents were sent to Gulag for
cutting in a breadline

FRANK
(beat)
That’s different too

LATER The summit is coming to a close Reagan and Gorbachev
are on their feet

GORBACHEV
I didn’t expect we would agree on
everything But I do believe we
have made progress

REAGAN
You should come to the United
States for the next one Consider
it an official company invite

GORBACHEV
Accepted A few more of these Mr
President and perhaps we won’t
have a Cold War any longer

REAGAN
But you’ll still be cold

For a split second no one knows how to react to that Until
Gorbachev starts to laugh

GORBACHEV
Nine degrees in Moscow today Brutal
(then)
Pleasure to meet you

They shake hands Reagan immediately breaks character

REAGAN
Great to work with you Let’s do
lunch

He walks off Gorbachev thinking it’s slang says

GORBACHEV
Let’s do lunch Mr President

Reagan walks over to Frank Once they’re out of earshot

REAGAN
How was that

FRANK
Brilliant Fantastic
(beat)
Didn’t love the very end but I can
live with it

Reagan continues to his quarters Poindexter stops Frank who

awaits a dressing down Instead Poindexter smiles possibly
for the first time ever It’s actually a little disturbing

So the lesson is to run faster than

Thanks for taking the time

across from Reagan

REAGAN
Not a problem What can I do ya for

FRANK
John Ford brought me a script A
western I’m thinking about making
it my next picture you’d be
perfect for it But the story could
use a little workshopping

REAGAN
Well I’m not a writer but I do
know what works and what doesn’t

Frank breathes deeply Here we go

FRANK
You play the sheriff of Rockland
Texas Their enemy is a rival town
calledTehranville

REAGAN
What’s their problem

FRANK
They think Rockland had their old
mayor in their pocket So they keep
on kidnapping people from Rockland
Ransoming them for money Meanwhile
a group ofIndians keep raiding
this other town SantaManagua
which is good for Rockland because
we--they don’t like them either

REAGAN
So Rockland is arming the Indians

FRANK
They’re not supposed to But every
time the Indians win a battle
Tehranville releases a hostage

REAGAN
Ah the plot with the kidnappers is
connected I like it

FRANK
And the Mayor of Rockland is
somehow at the middle of both
but he’s not all there upstairs

Reagan “knowingly” nods

FRANK (CONT’D)
We just need to tighten up the
connection a little bit

REAGAN
Hmm What if in exchange for the
hostages the sheriff has the
kidnappers arm the Indians

FRANK
I thought about that But the
kidnappers need weapons too
They’ve got their own war going on

REAGAN
What a world this is

FRANK
You’re tellin’ me

Reagan looks at the AMERICAN FLAG as if the answers lie
within the stripes They apparently do

REAGAN
How about this what if Rockland
knew they were going to kidnap
people What if the sheriff sells
the kidnappers the weapons in
exchange for hostages to make it
look like a deal And then they
give the profit to the Indians
They could even take a taste for
themselves

The wheels turn in Frank’s mind Oh my god

REAGAN (CONTD)
Now thats a story

Yes Yes it is Holy shit

extends beyond the law We have a

that the less the president knows
the better We have to protect his
legacy We have to protect him

Frank looks at his drink a symbol of complicity He slowly
pours it on the table Don shakes his head Oliver starts

question that Speakes can’t dodge

There was a deposit made in the
amount of ten million dollars from
the US Treasury

LARRY SPEAKES
Is that a question

The federal government clearly made
the deposit

LARRY SPEAKES

continue to shrink

(calling on someone)
Yes

Do you have any comments on the
President’s mental health

It’s like the wind is knocked out of Frank He fixates on the

Mr Rifai this gentleman to whom
you spoke is full of shit He’s
feeding you a fake story to cover
up the real one

ADAL
Why don’t you tell me the real one

FRANK
What’s Al-Shirra

country thinks we are in the pocket
of our government There’s an

told Mr Corden I can tell it

Puts an X in tape behind the podium And then he takes a pen

Henry and Frank know what he means Before it gets TOO real
JACK (CONTD)
How do you get a hot dog in the

luxury-whatever

FRANK
I’1l be right back

He heads for the Suite

INT MEMORIAL STADIUM - LUXURY SUITE - SAME

The Skybox is full of people who have little interest in the
game Washington schmoozers including Payne and Karl

PAYNE
You’re looking for advancement

KARL
We all are aren’t we

Dick watches the game through the window Next to him a
familiar face scans the field with binoculars We’1ll call him
‘W’ (42 Texan like you don’t know)

WwW
I love baseball man I should buy
a team or some shit

DICK
It’s a wonderful idea

Frank’s entrance is greeted by a smile from Dick
FRANK
Down in the cheap seats you just

raise your hand for a hotdog

DICK
Tray’s over there

FRANK
Great Thank you

As he collects food Frank spots Karl talking to someone
familiarIt’s SALLY CAHILL She drags her hand on his arm

FRANK (CONTD)
That’s Sally Cahill Dick that’s
Sally Cahill From the Dover Post

DICK
She’s actually moved over to Time
magazine

He sees the wheels turning in Frank’s head Calls to W

DICK (CONTD)
Hey Junior you can get a way
better look from outside

WwW
Cool I’ll try to spot some boobies

He romps out Dick and Frank are alone in the crowded box

FRANK
Why is Sally Cahill in this suite

DICK
She’s a great writer Did a little
piece for us a couple years back

FRANK
(beat then)
You leaked the dementia story

DICK
Karl leaked the dementia story I
leaked it to Karl Sort of like a
Russian Nesting Doll situation

Across the room Karl feverishly shakes PAYNE’S hand Sally
kisses him on the cheek

DICK (CONTD)
He’s a natural A real talent

FRANK
Why did you do that

DICK
Stack the deck You can’t have two
Chiefs of Staff two Defense
Secretaries Someone needs a job
someone already has that job
someone doesn’t have that job
anymore Simple thermodynamics

(MORE )
DICK (CONTD)
Don’t worry about the indictments
They’re correctable

FRANK
You knew I’d leak the Enterprise

DICK
I knew you’d do what was necessary
for your career

FRANK
You used me You used the
President

DICK
Oh Jesus kid you can’t even see the
house that you built Presidents have
term limits they lose elections But
the people behind the scenes do not
I worked for Nixon that guy invented
politics Do you think a goddamn
thing changed when he was gone Then
we were stuck with Ford he memorized
speeches to the tune of the Michigan
Fight Song We needed a face we
needed a voice We elected an actor
and didn’t even think about it You
showed us that it’s all we ever
needed It’s the 21st century we
don’t really need a president

FRANK
We need a leader

DICK
That’s not the president’s job Their
job is to kiss babies shake hands
and ask ever so humbly for your vote
Make people feel involved An
election is a beauty pageant who
looks the part A friend once said
that democracy is too important to be
left in the hands of the public

A CHEER resonates from the field intoxicating Dick

DICK (CONTD)
Listen to them Frank These are
voters They’ve all cast their
ballot They wear the jersey they
wear the hat and they root root root
for the home team

(MORE )

DICK (CONT’D)
Anyone can be on the field and
they’1ll cheer all the same because
it’s their side and they’re a part of
something Imagine that world no
candidates just teams That’s the
dream right there And you made me
believe in it again

(beat)
Ill be forever grateful to you

Frank is speechless W reenters the suite
W
Hey Dick If my Daddy’s the
President does that make me the
First Son

DICK
We can aim our sights a little
higher than that Junior There’s
someone I’d like you to meet
He squeezes Frank on the shoulder

DICK (CONTD)
Enjoy the game

Frank watches as he parades W to the crowd like his entry in
the state fair Karl is quick to shake his hand

W
George Bush

KARL
Karl Rove a pleasure

WwW
And what do you Mr Rove

KARL
I get things done

Frank floats out just as the crowd explodes in celebration
W
Quite a barnburner out there Who
are we rootin’ for

Dick cracks his crooked grin again

DICK
Whoever wins

We fade to black

INT REAGAN RESIDENCE BEL AIR LOS ANGELES - CONTINUOUS

Reagan sits in jeans and a t-shirt watching history unfold
on television when a SECRET SERVICE AGENT (JEFFERSON) enters

JEFFERSON
You have a visitor sir Mr Capra

REAGAN
Thanks Jefferson

Frank walks in reunited for the first time since the Gate

FRANK
Hello again sir

REAGAN
Frank You just missed Nancy She’s
off buying ceramics at the Farmer’s
Market Grab a seat

FRANK
I can’t stay long

REAGAN
You know our picture Best work I
ever did

FRANK
Yeah me too

REAGAN
What are you working on these days
Something new in the pipeline

FRANK
I’m directing commercials My
brother and I we’re doing one for
Chevy Cowboys American flags

REAGAN
Commercials That’s kind of a step
down isn’t it

FRANK
It’s honest work Everyone knows
were selling something

REAGAN
Like I can talk I hosted three
seasons of General Electric Theater

Frank takes a breath for the purpose of his visit

FRANK
Sir I want to say I’m sorry

REAGAN
Sorry For that little spat we had
on set That’s show business I
once called Gale Page an ‘evil
whore’ and we had coffee the very
next week

FRANK
I don’t think you’re ever going to
understand exactly what I mean I
projected something on you
Something that I wanted to be When
someone’splaying a president
you put all your hopes and dreams
on them You see them as a more
perfect version of you Politics
trick us into believing that’s out
there and it’s what we want And
it’s not fair To anybody

For a moment it almost looks like Reagan understands

REAGAN
You know my wife has some pretty
strong opinions about politics

FRANK

I bet she does

(beat)
Anyway with the news of the day I
don’t know if I would have been
able to live the rest of my life
without telling you that

(beat)
It was an honor sir

He turns to leave But

REAGAN
Hey Frank Get a beer Stay awhile

After a pause Frank sits down next to Reagan mirroring
their Christmas Card They watch the coverage of The Fall
REAGAN (CONTD)

You see this Berlin Wall came down
today This is history right here

I’ve always said it’s not

politicians or armies that change

things It’s ordinary people
(beat)
Can you believe it

Frank watches the televised events Does he believe it

REAGAN (CONTD)

Maybe this is going too far - the
self-importance of the actor - but
I can’t help but think our picture

had something to do with this

FRANK
It certainly made a difference

ON TV PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH is informed of the news

PETER JENNINGS

President Bush is getting word that
an enduring symbol of tyranny has
been toppled The world truly has

changed today

REAGAN

I’1l tell ya one thing working with

you made me wonder

FRANK
What’s that Ronnie

REAGAN

Why in the hell would anyone want
to be in politics It’s gotta be

the shittiest job in the world

Frank spots Karl in the background holding a book

PERFORMANCE NOTES FOR ACTORS

FRANK
The worst

Cue up ‘FAITH’ by George Michael as we hold briefly on the
two men on the couch and slowly fade like a distant memory
