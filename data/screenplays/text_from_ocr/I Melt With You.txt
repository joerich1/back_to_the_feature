WHITE- AUGUST 2 2010
EXT COLLEGE CAMPUS - GRADUATION CEREMONY - DAY 1
TITLE THE PAST

Seen abstractly manicured green lawn lined with row upon row
of folding chairs occupied by capped and gowned graduates
various viewpoints and perspectives fresh faces bright
eyes smiles

Hope and expectation in bright June sunlight A PA SYSTEM
issues final echoing words of an impassioned commencement
speech

VOICE
--and every person’s fight with
death is over before it begins
What makes the struggle worthwhile
therefore cannot lie in the
outcome but in the dignity in
which the fight is waged

Voice swallowed by a vortex of thundering applause Hovering
dreamlike images flicker - proud parents caps launched
skyward bodies scattering clustered groups a collage of
camera flash

FOUR MALE GRADUATES- bodies edge into semi-focus One
taller one wider one darker one narrower They amble
shuffle and preen

We don’t engage them as they come to a top step arms over
shoulders and around waists until they become one unit one
shape Comrades chums buds mates

Best Friends Forever

Pointed in various freezes and poses by unseen photographers
they shift and reassemble and blow out in the camera flash

With the final flash of white we see PURE WHITE forming into
a A HUGE MOUND OF WHITE POWDER

RAPID FIRE IMAGES UNDERSCORE THE ERA BODIES ARMS FINGERS
Needle drops on vinyl music blares Walkman Ray-Bans razor
blades lines high speed mouths suck alcohol albums of
bands we love - Undertones X Buzzcocks Ramones English
Beat

FROM ABOVE

Four male shapes huddle around a glass table A LARGE SHEET
OF PAPER in the center

CUT FROM ONE HAND TO ANOTHER HAND WRITING WORDS promuse25 years
never forget what this feels liketo forget ts to FALL

FROM BELOW

Faces as shapes bend to the glass toward us rolled bill in
nostrils gleams in eye fast-slow-fast focus of vision
intention desire animated We feel all this in our gut
From four corners of the screen hands reach out to each
other stacking on each other in some communal mask or team
agreement descending and blocking our view until the

screen goes BLACK

WOMAN (late 40s)

as she answers Jonathan without looking up He’s bored and
so is she - this is simply a formality

JONATHAN
So it’s your hands nonspecific
but uncomfortable

PATIENT
Yes

JONATHAN
You need something for the pain

PATIENT
I need something for the pain

JONATHAN
Yes

Jonathan nods writes out a prescription Oxycontin She
stops texting takes cash out of her bag lays it bare on the
examination table
She takes the prescription leaves without saying goodbye
Jonathan removes a pill bottle from his jacket takes a pill
from it dry swallows it

His eye looks at the money and then is caught by his medical
degree on the wall

It seems to mock him

EXT A PUBLIC PARK - CAROUSEL - LATE AFTERNOON 4

Establishing End of the ride Jonathan’s six-year-old son
MILES rides a carousel horse while Jonathan waits and
watches

The Jonathan we met in the office is manifestly different
than here He is buoyant illuminated from within by the
life-force of his Son

Miles climbs off the horse bolts to Jonathan smiles as he
runs Jonathan bends to greet Miles lifts him carries him

JONATHAN
First time by yourself Daddy’s so
proud of you

Jonathan turns to leave the carousel area Miles looks at

They look up see JANE Jonathan’s ex-wife Miles’ mother
She’s with her husband DANIEL (40s) Jonathan’s face falls
he glances at his watch sadly realizing visiting time is
over

As Miles squirms free of Jonathan Jonathan rushes this
out

JONATHAN
Daddy will see you in two weeks

---but Miles is already out of his grasp bolting toward his
mom
JONATHAN (CONTD)
(under his breath)

Bye Miles

When Miles is directly between Jane and Jonathan he stops
looks back waves at Jonathan hurries to his mother

a few seconds of silence

Miles his Mother and Daniel turn and walk away Miles
between them holding their hands

this

Richard reads some of Javier’s text then looks at him

RICHARD
The problem is you are not here
I don’t see you You’re writing
but you’re
(searches for the word)
You’re hiding

Richard hands it back to him Javier looks in Richard’s
eyes tries to absorb the words

RICHARD (CONTD)
If you want people to feel
anything you have to be willing to
expose yourself

Javier is not sure what he means

RICHARD (CONTD)
Confess explore say things people
are afraid of saying Unleash your
shit Javier make the words your
weapons

leave

Timothy This my friend is your
friend Richard We will be
celebrating your birthday on this

Tim smiles but there’s subtle melancholy in it His
doorbell rings he moves to answer it brightens as he opens
the door and sees LISA (30s)

TIM
Hello Lisa

LISA
Hello Tim

They smile at each other And as Tim closes the door

LISA (CONTD)

She indicates a CAT lounging on the floor

TIM
Doing what he does best

A MINUTE LATER

note with instructions and money on the table

There’s also a sealed envelope on the table marked “Lisa 2”

They say goodbye with a cheek kiss Lisa heads for the door

TIM (CONTD)
Leese

She stops turns looks at Tim He indicates the cat

TIM (CONT’D)

LISA
As always

Lisa leaves

Tim moves across the large open space of his loft to his bed
picks up an old wrinkled note an aged sheet of paper covered
in writing

He studies it We see fragments of writing in different
hands four different signatures We recognize it from the

opening

Tim carefully rolls up the sheet of paper and walks out of
the shot

BLACK SCREEN

DAY 1

EXT AERIAL SHOT - CLIFFS OF BIG SUR - LATE AFTERNOON 14

We glide over the sea toward the coast to a house sitting on
the precipice A song begins faintly at first growing
louder as we move in

A lone figure stands on the edge of the back deck of the
house looking out to sea When we are close enough we see
it’s Richard drink in hand

INT RENTAL CAR - TIM 15

His POV Slowing on HIGHWAY ONE as we see four different
colored balloons tied to an electronic gate Tim smiles as
he pulls onto the driveway

EXT HOUSE - FRONT SIDE - DRIVEWAY - LATE AFTERNOON 16

His rental pulls up next to a classic 80’s Porsche Targa he
gets out of the car stares at the house He hears music
blasting inside He grabs his bag walks to the front door

INT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 17

Tim steps in The house is huge modern flooded with light
Windows everywhere and they’re all open

He walks down the hallway to an enormous living room--- Wind
billows the curtains We can almost feel the ocean in here

Tim moves to the stereo music deafening turns it down

TIM
Hello

Richard appears He and Tim stare at each other a moment
Old friends Big smiles

RICHARD
First thing he does is turn my
fucking music down

A familiarity Richard moves to him they embrace happy to
see each other Comfort in the years Richard releases looks
at Tim’s face and body

RICHARD (CONTD)
You don’t age What’s the secret
Let’s sell it and get rich

Tim smiles Richard gestures to lines of coke on the coffee
table

RICHARD (CONTD)
Yes For old times It’s cold and
forsaken here

TIM
Maybe a drink To start anyway
(beat)
Love the car by the way Very you

RICHARD
I bought it from some guy on the
way from the airport Saw the for
sale sign and boom impulse buy

Richard moves to the coffee table bends toward the mirror

RICHARD (CONT’D)
I intend to destroy it within the
next five days

and sniffs a line of coke as Tim watches

TIM
Some things never change Richard

Richard flashes a million dollar smile For all his bravado
charm is his currency Richard sees something in Tim some
change a dimming of the lights in his eyes

RICHARD
What is it The big four five
You don’t have to worry They are
all the same

The gentle joshing bounces off the pain Richard’s eye is
caught by a necklace on Tim’s neck - simple but tasteful
pendant with initials Tim holds it out

TIM
Jill’s I’ve been wearing it
again Five years ago this month

Richard doesn’t flinch looks right at his friend

RICHARD
Jesus I Can’t believe it’s been
that long Unfucking real I’m so
sorry

Tim nods

TIM
Every time I see you without fail
you say those words and I always
believe you And you never try to
tell me to forget

Richard gives Tim a deep hug He comes out of it relieved
at the respite of smiling

RICHARD
But per usual I will be the
reminder that this week is about
forgetting about all that just for
a moment

Like a magician pulling a rabbit from a hat he shoves the
mirror under Tim’s nose raises his eyebrows ala Belushi in
Animal House Tim can’t help but laugh

EXT HOUSE - BACK SIDE - DECK - LATER - DUSK 18

Richard looks at Ron smiles

RICHARD
Let me ask you this Ronaldo when
your daughter’s hot 16 year-old
friends come over do you sometimes
wonder what it would be like to
fuck them in the ass until they’re
cross-eyed

Ron’s reluctance to answer instantly gives Richard his
opening

RICHARD (CONTD)
See See I told you

Laughter
RON
Shut the fuck up and pass me the
blow
RICHARD

I merely say what others think but
fear saying

Tim passes Ron a CD cover with a mound of cocaine on it and
Ron does a line

Beat He looks at Richard Then Tim He grabs them and
they embrace They release each other and Ron looks around

RON
For the first time in the fucking
history of internet real estate
photography the place looks as big
in real life as it did online

TIM

(then)
Let’s settle up when you feel like

RON
It’s already settled

Richard and Tim’s eyes meet

EXT ELECTRONIC GATE - NIGHT 23

Fingers punch a code on the gate keypad it hums to life and
slowly swings open A MAN walks down the driveway in the
darkness carrying a suitcase and a satchel bag toward the
house

EXT HOUSE - AROUND THE SIDE 24

We see the man emerge from the shadows and into the light
It’s Jonathan He watches his friends inside the house a
beat

He moves to the sliding glass window All they have to do is
look up They don’t He slides open the door and his face
brightens

TIM
Jonathan

Jonathan smiles moves inside The guys greet him

RON

prescription bottles

JONATHAN

RICHARD

hand Now make me a drink while I
urinate and get settled

INT JONATHAN’S ROOM - MINUTE LATER 25

Jonathan places prescription bottles on a dresser - Dilaudid
Oxycontin Adderall Fentanyl Librium Ketamine He speaks
a fragment from the Hippocratic oath to himself as he does

JONATHAN
Whatever houses I may visit I will
come for the benefit of the sick
remaining free of injustice and all
mischief

EXT HOUSE - MIDNIGHT 26

Moon and stars in the sky Silence surrounds this remote
house We hear laughter and music inside

INT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME 27

MUSIC LOUD Ron Richard Jonathan and Tim sit around the
large coffee table talking over the music

A solid blissed-out buzz perfect mix of alcohol coke
trust time and freedom Enough drugs to last no
responsibilities Chatter is fast they know each other’s
rhythm like a band that’s played together many times

RON
-no no no it’s a food aversion

JONATHAN
Women get it during pregnancy
Certain foods make them sick even
the smell

Richard snorts a line off a CD cover passes it to Jonathan

TIM
Are there any particular foods that-

RICHARD
(interrupts)
You know what my aversion is
(MORE )

RICHARD (CONTD)
This shit I see you guys once a
year and we’re talking about what

JONATHAN
(ignores Richard)
It’s random One theory is that
it’s the woman’s system protecting
the fetus from that which may be
harmful to it

Richard sighs loudly with boredom Jonathan does a line
passes it to Tim

RON
So when Amanda was pregnant with
Carrie she started getting really
nauseated And guess what it was

RICHARD
Oh God do tell I’m on the edge my
fucking seat

Ron looks at his friends

RON
It was me

Richard Tim and Jonathan look at him not understanding

RON (CONTD)
Yeah My scent

Richard explodes with laughter Tim and Jonathan follow
suit Ron shakes his head

RON (CONTD)
I had to sleep in another room the
first four months of the pregnancy
Or else she’d get nauseated

The guys laugh harder
RON (CONTD)
(faux pain whiney)
But guys being rejected made me
feel small insecure and unwanted
Laughter A moment of calm then
RICHARD
(to Jonathan)
How’s the world of dating doc

Jonathan shrugs

RON
Well as a doctor you have an
advantage You can knock them out
with drugs and take what belongs to
you

TIM
Oh my God

This sparks something in Richard

RICHARD
Tell them Jonathan Tell them what
you told me about the twenty-year-
old patient

Ron was joking And now this Jonathan looks at Richard
Tim looks at Jonathan like “you did not”

JONATHAN
(an edge)
Thanks Rich

He shakes his head looks down at the floor He looks up at
his friends with a face full of shame

TIM
I don’t think I can stay here for
this

JONATHAN

(to Tim heartfelt)
Timmy it was a one time thing I
swear

It’s difficult but Jonathan opens up to his friends

JONATHAN (CONTD)

A year ago a young patient came in
near the end of the day She was
very pretty to say the least and
it had been awhile for me

(hard but he presses on)
SoI used an anesthetic that
allowed me to

He trails off
RICHARD

Tell them what you did after you
sent the receptionist home

JONATHAN
I did things with herI basically
lost controloh God when I think
backit just makes me

Jonathan looks down shakes his head his shoulders
shudderhe cannot seem to go on or face his friends
becauseit’s too terrible

He looks up face distorted by the laughter he can no longer
contain

Richard howls Ron and Tim know they’ve been had And they
love it

Hysterical laughter Jonathan slaps Richard five

RICHARD
Ally oop

JONATHAN
Slam dunk
(through laughter)
But I have to say I’m saddened my
“friends” don’t even know what I do
for a living I’m an MD for Christ
sake not an anesthesiologist

INT SAME - LIVING ROOM - HOUR LATER 28
Talking doing lines drinking Music
TIM
No It was that girl Emily She

TIM

Laughter

Laughter

Laughter

RICHARD
Hi Mike It’s me Rich from
college Remember when Emily
Sullivan shit on your chest when
you were passed out How’s the
wife and kids

RON
Didn’t we used to call it “dick-
facing”

TIM

But Emily had good reason because
Mike had non-consensual sex with
her a few hours before when she was
passed out

JONATHAN
Double dick face
RON
I fucked Emily Did you guys fuck
her
RICHARD
Guilty as charged your honor
JONATHAN

Snyder
RICHARD

That is so fucking great Jonathan
Because I gave Emily the crabs So
I basically gave you the crabs

JONATHAN
Fuck you

RICHARD
And I fucking knew I had them when
I banged her

RON
You know how you get rid of the
crabs It’s a very old American
Indian remedy

They wait

RON (CONT ’D)
You shave one testicle then with
a good butane torch lighter you
light the other one on fire Then
as the little fuckers race away
from the burning ball you stab them
with an ice pic as they run across
the shaved one

Laughter Ron mimes furiously stabbing his balls Tim tries
to change the direction

TIM
Is it possible to have a
conversation that’s a little more
serious

RONRICHARD
No Fuck Off

RICHARD
That’s what I fucking hate We can
no longer do and say the things
that make us fucking feel good

JONATHAN
Saying and doing stupid things
makes you feel good

RICHARD
You know what I mean

Richard rolls a joint and sprinkles coke in it

RON
“Cock” doesn’t make me laugh but
schlong does

RICHARD
Exactly When men pass forty they
can no longer be honest about what
makes them laugh If you are you
are frowned upon

JONATHAN
And if you’re a father you lose
cred if you display immaturity

RON
Tim what word makes you laugh

TIM
(after he exhales a huge
hit of weed)
Vulva

JONATHAN
Bangkok

RICHARD
Time doesn’t just age you it
steals your right to laughter
which is fucking happiness Which
is a fucking crime

TIM
Men are afraid They think all
other guys will think less of them
if they loosen up and so they
don’t

JONATHAN
What is the replacement for
happiness

RON
Bla bla bla you guys are so
fucking pathetic

Richard stands up

RICHARD
But you aren’t Ron because you
don’t need to participate ina
conversation that might be
illuminating because you’re such a
powerful man

-and leaves the room

RON
(calling after Richard)
No you fuck it’s just that I came
here to talk about schlongs vulvas
and Bangkok

Jonathan raises the CD cover to his face and snorts a line

JONATHAN
I think I just found the happiness
replacement

TIM
Pass the happiness

Tim snorts a line Ron checks his Blackberry Jonathan
watches him

JONATHAN
You should throw that on the fire

Ron is about to answer but he’s distracted by

RICHARD (0S)
Happy birthday to you

Richard emerges from the hallway holding a cake with a
twelve inch house candle stuck in it at an angle The others
join in as Richard sets it down

RICHARD JONATHAN RON
Happy birthday to you Happy
birthday dear Timothy happy
birthday to you

Tim stares at it It’s a Little Mermaid Birthday Cake Ron
and Jonathan laugh

RICHARD
It was either that or one with a
fire truck

Tim smiles at that

RON
Aren’t you going to blow it out

Tim looks at his friends Absurd as the cake is he’s
touched

TIM
I guess I can die now

He leans forward blows the candle out His friends cheer
Richard moves to the stereo plays a song

RICHARD
Come on motherfuckers

He cranks U2’s Out Of Control so loud the house shakes The
guys jump up and dance - they know the words and the beat and
the dance becomes a reckless awesome spastic ceremonial act
invoking the past

The music keeps pumpingbut the camera slows and slows
and slows and pulls back and back and-

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT 29

The camera pulls further backaway from the househigh
into the air We hear A VOICE objective observational
anthropological

THE VOICE
Was it a sham or was it a ritual
At one time or another they
decided to keep it going At
first they looked forward to it
It was a reminder of hellion days
gone by unabashed abuse and
reigning freedom But as
responsibilities grew it became
the excuse the escape a chance to
become young again to time travel
to hide and run back to that safe
place where all mistakes were
erased where the poor choices
hadn’t been made yet It reminded
them of their original friendship
it was like they could all reach
out and feel what it had meant if
only for fleeting moments It went
on this way for years the ritual
the trip to Jamaica the year in
Vegas the New York series as it
was called Always an excuse to
run and remember The music the
copious drugs the feeling of
invincibility it was always the
same The belief they were forever
twenty-one and their whole life lay
ahead of them full of promise

TITLE DAY 2

EXT HIGHWAY ONE - LATE MORNING 30

A police car approaches in the distance

INT POLICE CAR - SAME 31

The local Police Chief LAURA BOYDE (late 30’s) drives
Soulful warm observational

Laura’s eyes are caught by the four balloons hovering on the
gate She looks at them with a subtle smile like she finds
them charming

EXTINT HOUSE - A SERIES OF SHOTS - LATE MORNING 32
Quiet The ocean Sea grass vibrating in the wind Sun
slanting into windows CD’s and empty booze bottles and
dirty glasses all over the living room and kitchen It’s
like nobody is here at all until we find

A HAND

On the round volume button of the stereo Slowly turning it
up We hear the smooth intro of a song introducing this new
day as we go

WIDER - ON RICHARD

Letting go of the volume control and just standing there in
a slash of sunlight half of him on fire from it a beer in
his hand the song inside of him and blasting out to-

EXT BACK DECK - SAME 33

Where Ron and Jonathan sleep on lounge chairs wrapped in
blankets beyond them only the sea

Ron’s eyes blink open from the song bloodshot and bleary
Jonathan listens a beat then pulls a blanket up over his
face

INT TIM’S ROOM 34
He lays on his back Stares at the ceiling He knows this
song knows what it means to him and his friends A smile
fills his eyes The song continues and takes us to

INT HOUSE - SAME 35

Richard walks across the living room floor and out onto--
35A

EXT HOUSE - DECK 35A
He says this like a General rallying his troops

RICHARD
We no longer possess the supple
flesh of twenty-one-year olds and
how nightmarishly true our brain’s
regenerative skills have become
with age Therefore our only
recourse to this sorrowful state we
find ourselves in is more booze
treats from the doctor’s bag and
the revitalizing elements of the
sea

And Richard’s voice echoes us into

EXT BEACH - NOON 36

From behind four naked men bolting for the water and
screaming a collective

GUYS IN UNISON

EXT BEACH - DAY 37

Mayhem emerges from the sea oh fuck it’s cold Coming up

fine

INT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON 40

Ron stares at his laptop He looks stressed as he studies
the business news on his screen He takes a deep drink from
his glass to shield him from what he hears

INT RICHARD’S ROOM - SAME 41

He snorts a line of blow and looks at himself in the mirror
It’s not that he likes what he sees or doesn’t like what he
sees he is looking at himself with pure objectivity

INT JONATHANS ROOM - SAME 42

Jonathan stands at the dresser in his room with a towel

EXT BACK DECK - CONTINUOUS 44

him kisses his forehead

Tim’s eyes open he sees Richard’s upside-down face inches
from his own

RICHARD

Wanna go for a ride

And as they look at each other’s face we hear the growing
whining sound of the -

EXT PORSCHE - RACING BY - ROAD - LATER - AFTERNOON 45
Speeding on a long straight road engine screaming at max

RPM It blasts past us and at the very moment it does we go-
INT SAME 46

Richard drives Tim sits next to him Music blasts They
intermittently sing along

Tim holds a baggie of coke and a butter knife He dips the
butter knife into the baggy and scoops out a pile and places
it under Richard’s nose Richard sniffs it Timmy does a
line

Richard accelerates and they smile into the raw freedom of
the speed

EXT BACK DECK - SAME TIME - AFTERNOON 47
Ron Out away from us on the deck Looking down

We go in close He’s staring at his Blackberry

The screen has a small graph and text “mortgage backed
securities slammed fourth day in a row” Ron closes his eyes
tight His Blackberry rings gives him a jolt

Amanda’s smiling face caller ID appears He clicks ignore
He moves to the edge of the deck takes a first step on the
steps leading down to the sea as we go-

disappearing from view

Driving fast on the open road then downshifting and slowing
for a curve

INT PORCHE - SAME 50
Holiday In Cambodia by the Dead Kennedys plays loud Tim

notices a tiny figurine of a man hanging from the rear view
mirror by a string

He looks at the side Richard’s face as Richard accelerates
into a long straight

TIM
(quietly)
I’m going to miss you

Richard doesn’t hear it The Porsche picks up speed Tim
cranks the music LOUD as they bend into the speed race into
the moment blast into their shared past and present

EXT PORSCHE -— SLOWING 51
Dunes in the distance the car slowing Turning off the
paved road onto a dirt road Towards the dunes in the
distance and the distant sea

They see an abandoned graffiti sprayed building

The car skids to a violent stop They get out with the music
still blaring Richard takes a leak against the wall and

Tim does a line

They simply explore this outpost of desolation without words
and with comfort

They see color and violence and expression They see
themselves

They get back in the speed machine fishtail down the dirt
road straightens roars off leaving a twisting plume of dust
behind it

SECONDS LATER

The Porsche rounds a corner going fast faster fastest

and careens down the sandy road over a big bump and into the
air and lands with a thud and gets stuck

INT PORCHE - SAME 52

Richard and Tim look at each other And burst out laughing

INT HOUSE - A FEW MINUTES LATER 53
Jonathan and Ron are making blender drinks in the kitchen
Ron’s Blackberry vibrates He looks irritated then he reads

HELP

As their eyes meet we go-

EXT THE DUNE - HALF HOUR LATER - LATE AFTERNOON 54

In the distance we see the Porsche at the base of a
monumental sand dune We see two small figures on top of the
dune

CLOSER - SAME

Tim and Richard on top of the dune Tim squats down and
grabs a fist full of sand stands He sifts it through his
fingers intermittently

TIM
This is the best I’ve felt all
year Being here with you guys

RICHARD
Yes indeed

TIM
But I know it’s because I can’t
feel anything The drugs

RICHARD
Maybe it’s not Maybe it’s us
being together Don’t just rule

that out
TIM
That’s why we do this
RICHARD
Right
TIM
A question Rich Is that why we
do this
RICHARD

I look forward to it I want it to
happen It’s kind of a Christmas
Or if you’re a non-Christian then
it’s like a birthday And if
you’re a Jehovah’s Witness and you
don’t celebrate birthdays then it’s
like the day you get married
Though less subdued than you might
imagine the typical Jehovahs
Witness Wedding to be
TIM
The Jehovah’s Witness wedding
(removes the butter knife
from his pocket imitates
sniffing a line off it)
None of this

RICHARD
Doubtful
TIM
But at your wedding
RICHARD
(absurd to think of it)
My wedding
TIM

When’s that

Richard looks at the car

RICHARD
We’re stuck man

Tim looks at Richard Pretends he can’t see him

TIM
Richard Richard

Richard smiles knows he’s busted

TIM (CONT’D)
Was that the ‘non-rebuttal
rebuttal’

RICHARD
I don’t think that qualifies But
it was evasive

TIM
Why don’t you have a woman Rich
I mean I know you have women but
like THE woman

RICHARD
Why on earth would I need “THE”
woman Why why why why

TIM
You know to tame you Train you

They laugh
RICHARD
I’m house trained Untamed
perhaps but I don’t piss on the
carpets

TIM
It’s okay to let a girl love you

RICHARD
(gestures to himself)
I mean really who wants this My
mother She does But she’s

He makes a gesture like his Mother is somewhere in the
ether

TIM
You fuck lots of women but have
you ever loved one

RICHARD
I love them all You can’t love
them all if you only love one

TIM
If that’s true that’s interesting

RICHARD
Let me tell you what I think
Timothy I think when they really
see me don’t like what they see

TIM
You make sure of that

RICHARD
(thinks then)
Lot’s of guys do

TIM
Because then it’s commitment

A beat
RICHARD
(re the dune)

Look where we are

TIM
The men have mounted the dune

RICHARD
Mount Dune Good strong words

TIM
We are duned

RICHARD
I have my friends Timmy I have
my job
(then)
And I have my dream that I’1l write
another book

They are both distracted by a honking horn A TOW
TRUCK Approaching fast

Ron rides inside with THE DRIVER Jonathan hangs off the
side like a fireman in a Fourth of July parade cigarette in
mouth sunglasses on long scarf around his neck trailing in
the wind

In his free hand he holds pitcher of Margaritas and glasses
Tim and Richard look at him from the top of the dune His
grin is insane beautiful Then look at each other and
smile

TOW TRUCK POV Richard and Tim Two figures against the
late afternoon sky

EXT DUNES - HALF HOUR LATER 54A
The guys find old cardboard and plastic trays and slide and
roll and glide down the dunes like ecstatic children
Abandoned and reckless and careening

Free The danger takes us to sunset and deep inside their
glee

EXT HOUSE - EVENING 55
The house Cocktail hour Beautifully peaceful against the
evening sky backdrop

INT HOUSE - RICHARD’S ROOM - EVENING 56

A large vaulted room one small mattress One lamp Richard
lays on one of the beds drink in hand

A small door near the floor catches his eye

INT KITCHEN - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME 57

Tim watches Ron from the kitchen window Ron is on his cell
and looks panicked and upset

EXT HOUSE - DECK 58

We are right with Ron now We see the deep stress in his
face in the shadows of the flood lights

RON
(shocked quiet)
What The SEC and a fucking
government subpoena Jesus Christ

Ron listens Says a barely audible “yeah” three times and
then clicks off He rolls his neck as if trying to twist the
stress out Takes a swig from the cocktail in his hand

EXT BACK DECK - SECONDS LATER 59

Tim walks out of the sliding glass door holding a tray with
wedges of lime tequila shots salt

TIM
Need a drink

Ron shakes his nearly full cocktail shakes his head Takes
a deep breath Tim sets the tray down on the railing

RON
I’m good now Sorry for yelling
some incompetencies in my office

Tim nods sips his shot catches the panic and fear in Ron’s
eyes for a FLASH but Ron masks it Ron drains his cocktail
in one long ferocious pull takes the shot from the tray that
Tim offered and knocks it back as well

RON (CONTD)
That’s more like it

Tim reaches into his pocket holds out an old Polaroid to Ron
- the four guys in college

TIM
Recognize any one here

Ron’s studies it He bursts out laughing but it’s forced and
weird

RON
Jesus who the fuck are those
people What’s with that hair

Tim laughs drains his shot Ron glances back at the photo
loses himself in it for a beat

RON (CONTD)
So fucking long ago

Ron’s face reveals a flash of sadness as he sees his younger
self

RON (CONT’D)
I don’t recognize that guy

TIM
I recognize you

A beat then

TIM (CONT’D)
Do you ever get scared

RON
(too strong)
Why the fuck would I get scared

Tim bristles

INT RICHARD’S ROOM - SAME - NIGHT 60
There is a 24X24 painting laying flat on the floor

Richard hovers over it on his knees It’s a child’s painting
of a lighthouse near a cliff

It looks like the entire ocean is on fire The title is
“This is the end of the World” It’s signed by Bobby 9 12

EXT BACK DECK - SAME 61

Ron looks at Tim Hold this Then

RON
I’m not sure what you’re asking me

TIM
I guess I’m asking you if your life
turned out the way you thought it
would

RON
Why Because you’re asking
yourself that

Tim doesn’t answer

RON (CONTD)
Can’t we just have a good time
That dreamy shit ain’t for me Not
now it’s not

TIM
Okay very hunter and gatherer of
you

RON

That’s why I love you Tim You
were always a little more evolved
than me Maybe being part girl can
do that for you help you develop
that sensitivity

Tim’s eyes are pained That was below the belt And Ron
regrets saying it Softer now

RON (CONTD)
Do you know what I think I think
I don’t want to think and that’s
why I came here
(sincere)
Maybe you came here for another
reason

TIM
I came here to be with the people
who mean something to me

RON
There ya go Now shouldn’t we go
inside and spend time with them

And as Ron waits for Tim’s response

INT HOUSE - BATHROOM - SAME TIME 62

Dark save candles throwing shadows around the room and
flickering in the reflection of the bath water Jonathan
lays in a large bathtub glass of booze on his belly

Music plays softly on a boom box Richard enters quietly
takes in the scene the music silently kneels down next to
the tub Jonathan looks at him

RICHARD
Open your mouth and close your
eyes

Jonathan does Richard reaches in his pocket drops a pill
on Jonathan’s tongue

RICHARD (CONTD)
Guess

Jonathan feels the shape of the pill on his tongue

JONATHAN

Dilaudid a morphine derivative

(beat)
I had a patient who offered me a
large sum of money for a
prescription Changed the
landscape of my clientele She had
many friends

Jonathan opens his bloodshot eyes looks in Richard’s

RICHARD
And this became your practice
Rather than the one you imagined
you would have

Jonathan is silent then

JONATHAN
I remember in college right after
we met I remember saying ‘you can
write about people and I can save
lives’

Richard taps the surface of the water every few seconds
creating ripples on which the candlelight rolls and shimmers

JONATHAN (CONTD)
I used to go with my father on
house calls One time when I was
eight my father was in the next
room with a man who had bone
cancer I was in the living room
with the man’s two daughters and
his wife and the man was screaming
in pain

(beat)

They were staring at me like my
father was going to save him I
wanted to tell them what my father
told me before we got there that
he was going to die

(MORE )

JONATHAN (CONTD)

Soon the guy stopped screaming my
father probably shot four hundred
milligrams of morphine into him
When my father walked out of the
room they looked at him like he
was some sort of savior

(then)
And so did I

Very slowly Jonathan sinks into the water and disappears
under the shimmering surface

Ron despite being high knows this in his bones nods

RON

She doesn’t push me She doesn’t
question me We respect what we
both do and what we do is defined
I know my role

(beat under his breath)
I don’t know why I have done the
things that I’ve done

Richard turns to him Not even sure he just heard that
right

Captain Bob navigates to another spot The lines chop

why
EXT MAIN DECK - LATER - LATE AFTERNOON 69

Tim and Captain Bob are talking Jonathan is in a deep sleep
fifteen feet away from them under a canopy

Captain Bob stands next to a fishing rod which ticks slowly
as the line draws out Tim sits on a deck chair

CAPTAIN BOB
So it’s reunion huh

TIM
We all went to college together
Jonathan and Richard have known
each other since grade school We
meet every year somewhere

CAPTAIN BOB
Nice to catch up

Waves slap against the hull of the boat

CAPTAIN BOB (CONTD)
I left school when I was fourteen
and the sea kept me moving so I
never did have any reunions The
ones I remember are with my wife
after long fishing trips back when
I did commercial work

We see a trace of dread on Tim’s face Is this guy going to
talk his ear off

CAPTAIN BOB(CONT’D)

She died 11 years ago Cancer I
spent most days just drifting out
here trying to understand

(adjusts a fishing line)
Suddenly I noticed so many
miserable people arguing with each
other husbands and wives treating
each other like animals

Tim listens engaged no longer worried about being held
captive

CAPTAIN BOB(CONT’D)
I stopped feeling sorry for myself
and felt sorry for them I
realized I was lucky to have felt
something that looked or smelled or
resembled real love A lot of
folks never taste that

Tim stands moves to the railing looks out at the ocean

TIM
I tasted it And it made every
day
(searches for the word)
annointed

TIM (CONTD)
Nothing mattered when we were
together and when we were apart I
felt him like I felt my own breath

Captain Bob looks at him relating Tim’s love for a man to
the love he had for his wife sensing how deep it was

CAPTAIN BOB

And

TIM
Johan died five years ago In an
accident

Captain Bob moves from the rod to the railing near Tim They
stare out to sea

CAPTAIN BOB
You believe in heaven

Tim eyes the waves swirling below him Tim smiles at Captain

TIM
Actually I don’t

And off Captain Bob’s look

Seafood restaurant in town Mixed of people Richard drinks
at the bar when the hostess RANDI on her name tag
approaches

RANDI
Did you have the large order to go

RICHARD
How many orders to go do you have

RANDI

RICHARD
The fine art of deduction says it’s
me

Richard looks her over-

RANDI
Would you like to pay now

-and sees how beautiful she is

RICHARD
Would you like to come home with my
order

She laughs innocently She’s pretty when she does

RANDI
I’m working And you should work
on your lines

RICHARD
If I work on my lines will you
consider my offer

She smiles

RANDI
No

Richard takes out his wallet removes a credit card hands it
over She leaves The strapping young BARTENDER glares

at Richard

RICHARD
That’s a fairly possessive
expression on your face She your
girlfriend

BARTENDER
No

RICHARD
Then why are you looking at me like
that

Bartender stares at Richard with a contemptuous smile leans
over the bar to get closer

BARTENDER
You’re pathetic and drunk And
she’d never go out with an old man
like you

Richard knocks back his drink takes a hundred dollar bill
out of his wallet and lays it down

RICHARD
Thank you The world needs more
people like you Keep it

Bartender is not sure how to respond Richard spins wobbly
off the bar stool moves to the podium near front door

Five large bags of food are being brought out Randi has his
check ready A subtle flirtation between them as he signs

RANDI
Looks like you’re feeding an army

RICHARD
Leave with me Walk out without
looking back

RANDI
You’re really high

He signs his credit card slip Grabs a business card and
writes his cell number address and gate code on it

RICHARD
I’m in town for three days Me and
my friends We are harmless and
fun If you plan on tossing that
card instead of calling me wait
till I’m ten minutes away so I
don’t feel it I’m sensitive that
way

He grabs his take-away and leaves Randi’s eyes follow him
out the door

78 INT RICHARD’S ROOM - NIGHT - HALF HOUR LATER 78

Richard bursts in with Jonah whips a hardcover book off a
dresser Reel Around The Fountain by Richard Leclair

JONAH
You wrote it

Richard nods opens it to a random page reads out loud

RICHARD
‘Death had been installed in our
home and my Mother hadn’t ordered
it It was a delivery from Satan
for being good or a lesson from God
about life and she hid it deep
inside her where I couldn’t see it
because she thought it was what my
dead father would have wanted But
over the years the pain slowly
oozed out of her hiding place like
poison and consumed her from
within’

The words sound new and strange to Richard He and Jonah’s
eyes meet He hands the book to Jonah who looks it over
impressed

JONAH
Is it autobiographical

RICHARD
Every first novel is

JONAH
Howd it do

RICHARD
It made the New York Times Best-
seller list for a couple of weeks

JONAH
That is insane So when’s the next
one

RICHARD

We should get out of here

Richard heads for the door Jonah watches him confused by
his response then follows

Unless someone needs a specialist

to med school I like it though
Are you an MD

Jonathan takes a beat before he answers

JONATHAN
A lot of my patients come to me for
a certain brand of medical care
they otherwise wouldn’t have access
to

Ethan’s look tells Jonathan he doesn’t follow Ethan hits
off the joint waits

JONATHAN (CONTD)
I provide them with prescriptions
for pain killers when in fact they
really don’t need them

Ethan instinctively and without judgement
ETHAN
That is spiritually filthy How do
you like look at yourself

JONATHAN
I get rid of all the mirrors

INT LIVING ROOM - HALF HOUR LATER 80

Ron and Ryan are front of the fireplace talking Ryan hands
a CD cover with coke on it to Ron

RYAN
--anyway this rich guy Greenberg
comes to town and he’s building
this ugly twenty-five thousand foot
mansion right on the ocean in front
of my mom’s house

Ron snorts a line

RYAN (CONT ’D)
My mom’s tried to stop him legally
but he just crushes her with his
money The fucker is actually
putting in a helicopter pad

RON
Hey if the guy can live like a
king why the fuck not

RYAN
Why is total excess equated with
living like a king Why do people
need all that shit
RON
(self-evident)
Because the shit is there

Ryan shakes his head

RYAN
That’s crazy You actually believe
that

RON

I don’t believe that I know that

RYAN
Well you can’t know something if
it’s a choice

RON
Is that some college bullshit you
learned from your philosophy
professor

This throws Ryan

RYAN
I’m just saying people don’t need
certain things even though they
might think they do

Ron’s transformation from light to dark is instant
RON
(quiet vicious)
How the fuck would you have any
idea what people need
Ron looks in Ryan’s eyes squeezes the glass in his own hand
like he’s trying to crush it He does Blood flows He
doesn’t look down he keeps his eyes locked on Ryan’s
RON (CONTD)
Talk to me when the naivete wears
off

Ron gets up walks away Ryan follows with his eyes

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT - HALF HOUR LATER 81

Richard Jonah and Randi Richard pours a large glass of
vodka

Richard is so drunk now it’s hard for him to stand straight

RICHARD
What kind of fiction do you write

He holds out the bottle to them refill They both decline
JONAH
I just write stories Things that

mean something to me

RICHARD
Ah the personal stuff

RANDI
He’s great really amazing

RICHARD
So you submit them like
quarterlies and crap like that

Randi and Jonah look at each other and smile

JONAH
My last one ran in The New Yorker

RANDI
We were all so proud

Richard looks at Jonah mock impressed

RICHARD
(with an edge)
And there will be another story
And then some heat Then you’11l
write the novel And then fucking
what

Jonah is not sure what to make of this Randi looks at
Richard Then Jonah Then Richard again

RANDI
I don’t understand Is there
something wrong with that

JONAH
You published a book I’d love to
be able to do that

RICHARD

You remind me of someone

(drunkenly waves his drink

as he speaks it splashes

on the floor) )
You think it’s justit’s just
going to happen And it will it
will But it won’t be anything
like you dreamed it would

Jonah stares at him Then

JONAH
Who do I remind you of

Richard is too drunk to answer thumbs himself in the chest
with the hand holding the drink

RANDI
(strong)
You No way I don’t think so

Richard seems confused by this it seems to penetrate the
inebriation

RICHARD
I was like that all excited about
this And that And it was all
gonna beso fuck-ing rosyso
fucking

He trails off

RANDI
Jonah’s not like that he doesn’t
think everything is going to be a
certain way He just loves to
write

JONAH
You don’t have to speak for me-

She leans to him

RANDI

You have all this disillusionment
because it’s easier than being
honest And you think he’ll be
like you when he’s older because it
makes you feel better

(beat)
Stay cynical

Jonah tries to quiet her

JONAH
Randi

Richard goes pale pained embarrassed by what he knows they
see He looks down mumbles softly

RICHARD
I still love to write
(beat)
I still do I just

Jonah and Randi look at him and then each other silently
communicating it is time to leave

INT TIM’S ROOM - LATER 82

Raven Cole and Tim are on Tim’s bed touching exploring
each other All of this is in almost total darkness

COLE
I am so high This feels sooooo
good

Close on Tim Something happening in his eyes The mood
the room the vitality of Raven and Cole it’s slipping away
from him Cole reaches down to unzip Tim’s pants Tim stops
him

TIM
I can’t

Tim shifts extracts himself from their embrace sits on the
edge of the bed Raven sits next to him naked Her long
black hair shines in the dim light pale skin looks ghostly

She stares at Tim leans in close gently licks his lips

RAVEN
You feel it

She puts his hand between her legs Says this softly

RAVEN (CONTD)
You want this

Tim looks away She gently turns his head towards hers
looks him in the eye She is loving sexual free Tim is
uncomfortable as he takes in her features

TIM
You look like my sister Jill

Raven giggles playfully

RAVEN
Not into incest

She says it lightly she means nothing at all by it Tim has
to hide how horrible the words make him feel

RAVEN (CONT ’D)
You should ask her to come over so
I can judge for myself I like
girls too

Tim starts to feel his insides pulling out Cole and Raven
are too high to see it Tim Closes his eyes

TIM
It’s impossible
(beat)
She’s dead

Three bodies in the dark All we hear is the waves outside
the window and the din of the distant party

Cole stops moving for a beat Then lays his head on Tim’s
shoulder strokes him comforts him Raven takes his hands

COLE
How did she die

This is sacred private Tim’s closed eyes open tears fall
He speaks numbly

TIM
I killed her Her and my
boyfriend I killed them in my
car Five years ago I was drunk
I lived and they died

Cole looks like he has stopped breathing But Raven is cool
druggy and profound the witchy savant She takes his face
into her hands stares into his eyes accepts it She knows
pain and love

RAVEN
This life this earth is hell
this place we live This is a
state a stop on the way True
Nirvana only happens when we die
They were lucky Death is
something to attain

Tim lets this pour through his mind and body Cole holds
him tighter and fiercer Raven says this with clarity and
calm

RAVEN (CONT’D)
Do you see them alive when you
close your eyes to go to sleep

Tim relents opens up lets Cole kiss him Raven rubs his
skin she feels exactly how it feels to him and where he
needs her touch

RAVEN (CONT’D)
(softly)
Youll see them again And they
will forgive you

Raven puts her hand on Tim’s beating heart whispers to him

RAVEN (CONT ’D)
Let me be her

Cole hears this leans into Tim’s ear

COLE
And me him

Role playing Trauma Hands grips hair Nails dig into
flesh Skin is almost pierced with teeth Lips meet in
pleasure and pain Tim cries silently through it Says this
over and over barely audible

TIM

I want to see them let me see

them

EXT HOUSE - DAWN

The rises over the ocean

Randi and her friends get into the

car and back out of the driveway

ANGLE ON

The front window of the house We see Richard’s drawn face
staring out with sad bloodshot eyes

DAY 4

INT HOUSE - JONATHAN’S ROOM - DAWN 84

Jonathan’s eyes reflect the wear and tear He finishes
dialing his cell drops it fumbles for it picks it up

JONATHAN

Jane

JANE (0C)
Do you have any idea what time it

is Jonathan

JONATHAN

It’s

JANE (0C)
-five thirty in the morning Miles

is sleeping

JONATHAN
I just miss him and-

JANE (0C)
-you know Daniel works late

Daniel stirs next to her in bed

JONATHAN
Oh right so he can control the
world’s oil markets How do those
guys make so much money when the
whole the country is broke

Jonathan winces knows he shouldn’t have said that

JANE (0C)
Are you drunk

JONATHAN
Course not I’m high

JANE (0C)
My God Jonathan You get together
with your old friends and you can’t
even pretend to be grown-ups

JONATHAN
I’m pretending you still love me

JANE (0C)
I’m hanging up

JONATHAN
Tell me Jane how did it go from
you loving me to not loving me
Tell me again Tell me Jane
(she hangs up)
I want to hear it again

Jonathan looks at his cell phone lets it drop to the floor
He picks a random prescription bottle from the many on his
bedside table opens it takes a pill out and dry swallows
it He glances at the label afterward Ketamine

JONATHAN (CONTD)
Good choice doctor
INT HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAWN 85
Richard enters the living room and sees Tim standing there
walking down the hallway with a vacuum cleaner Stands there
still
TIM
I’m going to go on a cleaning
frenzy

He turns it on and begins to vacuum

Richard watches Tim clean The house is a wreck Tim is
oblivious to him and zombie focused on the task

RICHARD
I’m gonna follow Ron and Jonathans
lead and crash

Tim smiles the most beautiful smile at Richard

TIM (CONTD)
It’s going to look completely
different in here
INT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - TWO HOURS LATER - MORNING 86

Immaculate

Like the party never happened Quiet Only distant surf
through the glass

Tim walks quietly through the spotless kitchen cracks open
windows throughout the house to let in fresh air

He walks down the hallway to Richard’s room Richard is
passed out on the bed Tim stares sees Richard’s jacket
crumpled on the floor moves to it hangs it neatly across
the back of a chair He stares at Richard’s face

He walks out into the hallway quietly closes Richard’s door
behind him

He walks into his room He zips open his bag reaches into
it pulls out a rolled up piece of paper Opens it and reads
it

We see fragments of writing on it and remember it from his
bed at the beginning

Tim turns catches his reflection in a bureau mirror
He stares expression even

FADE TO BLACK
INT HOUSE - JONATHAN’S ROOM - TWO HOURS LATER - LATE 87
MORNING

Close on Jonathan’s face on his closed eyes We hear a
strange distant sonic hiss

It sounds otherworldly Ketamine altered like time itself is
making sounds He opens his eyes listens Pipes maybe

Or a shower

He can hear it now He listens a beat then covers his head
with a pillow falls back into a Ketamine slumber

JONATHAN’S ROOM - ONE HOUR LATER 88

Jonathan wakes again to the same sound He listens a moment

INT HALLWAY - A MINUTE LATER 89

Jonathan walks out of his room loses his balance uses the
wall to steady himself

He arrives at the bathroom door Listens He turns the
handle It’s open

INT BATHROOM 90
As he walks inside He cannot see for the thick steam

JONATHAN
Hello

There’s no answer Steam pours out Jonathan can’t be sure
but something is coming into view inside the shower

Something hovering inside of it

Jonathan stops cold Stares HE SUDDENLY LUNGES FORWARD AND

THROWS THE SLIDING GLASS SHOWER DOOR OPEN

A BODY
TIM

Hanging from a rope that’s tied to a pipe that juts out from
the wall in the shower

Jonathan tries to lift him to take the pressure off his
neck to get him down to get him safe

The hot water burns down on him he SCREAMS through the
anguish and hot water and Ketamine

JONATHAN (CONTD)
Rich Rich Fucking help me

Jonathan loses his balance in the water falls against the
shower door pops it off it’s rails It crashes against the
toilet and THE GLASS SHATTERS

SECONDS LATER

Richard bursts in freezes dives toward the water faucets
winds them off grabs Tim by the legs raises him

Jonathan lifts the rope off the pipe walks on the broken
glass helps Richard lay Tim on the floor

Jonathan kneels next to him begins to administer CPR hard
we hear Tim’s sternum crackafter twenty seconds he does
something strange he sits back slides against a wall and
just stares

RICHARD
What the fuck are you doing

Jonathan looks at Richard

JONATHAN
He’s dead

Seconds pass The faucet drips Life goes on elsewhere in
the world and the world revolves around the sun

Ron appears in the doorway Looks at them The rope around
Tim’s neck SEES IT ALL Ron is speechless

Richard sees something laying across the sink A rolled up
sheet of paper He stands moves to it

Jonathan climbs to his feet as Ron steps inside

Richard does something as the paper comes into view he
stops Like the thought that flashed through his mind was so
violating it had physical impact

He steps toward the sink unrolls it We recognize it from
Tim’s apartment the paper that was on his bed Richard

reads in silence

Richard laughs A strange laugh A laugh laced with
confusion Jonathan and Ron look at each other

Richard leaves it walks out of the steamy room a little
crazed

WE MOVE WITH HIM DOWN THE HALLWAY AND STAY ON HIS FACE

He stops walking stares at us He is utterly stunned

INT LIVING ROOM - ONE HOUR LATER - NOON 91
Ron paces the room

Jonathan stares out the front window of the house

Richard sits on the couch with the paper laid out on the
coffee table studies it like it’s a part of himself he
thought he’d lost forever

Nobody says a word They are searching for a way in

Richard stares at it He blurts out something incongruous
something that instantly gets Jonathan and Ron’s attention

RICHARD
Motherfucker He beat me to the
punch

Ron stops pacing stares at Richard disbelieving
Jonathan turns from the window

JONATHAN
Help me here I’m lost

Richard touches the note with his fingers

RICHARD
I’m not I remember everything
Senior year the room upstairs with
the green couch and Joy Division
posters all over the walls Like
yesterday

They search to remember Jonathan sways in stillness near
the front window Ron sits down dazed stares at Richard

JONATHAN
Wait that’s right It was Timmy’s
ideahe said something like ‘are
we gonna remember this moment or
have friend’s like this’

Richard takes over through the drugs and emotion he
remembers like it was yesterday

RICHARD
--’are we ever going to feel like
this again this alive and possible
and free again I’1l1 never forget
that And yet I did I fucking
forgot it

RON
We all did

RICHARD
Tim didn’t

No we see the PAPER AND NOTE FULL ON

The paper is yellowed and crinkled with age The words are
in a faded dark marker

EACH LINE WAS WRITTEN BY A DIFFERENT HAND

£5 years from now

if WE CAn’t remEMber what this feels like then we have forgotten THIS beautiful
moment

who we said we’d become our PROMISE TO each other swearing to FRIENDS We
will never forget

See THISour life we want to live and the men we want to will be

To forget this feeling is to FAIL and if we forget it this promise for all of us
dees we will die as one

The names are signed

rich tim JR Ron

There is a long silence a processing The dead body of
their best friend is down the hall Ron is imploding He
needs a drink He needs to flee

RON
Yeah but we said a lot of things
when we’re young

Richard stares at Ron

RICHARD
So your word is no good This
means nothing

Ron looks at the note on the table reads it again looks
back at Richard The truth of the situation descends on him
envelopes him He begins pacing again

RON
We have to call the police Right

Ron appeals to Jonathan To say something Jonathan shrugs

JONATHAN
And say what’hello officer We
signed this pact when we were in
college and our friend is dead
Can you come pick up the dead
body’

Jonathan moves away from the window unsteady He uses the
wall for balance

RON
Who fucking gives a shit
RICHARD
Timmy obviously didhe remembered
what we wanted to be And so do I

Ron sweats heart and mind racing Jonathan grinds his
teeth

RON
This is insane We’re high we’re
fucking high as shit

RICHARD
Which is exactly why we need to
think this through

Ron tries to convince himself this is not happening

RON
We’ll come down sleep Yeah
sleep it off We just need it to
be the next day It’1ll be all
right We’ll figure it out

JONATHAN
I can’t come down

Ron stops pacing something has just occurred to him

Ron
Wait wait waitI’m confused Are
we talking about not calling the
cops

The question hangs in the air Then we hear two voices
inside one out One thinks it one says it

JONATHAN RICHARD
All our names are on the note

Ron looks between them This line of thinking is not
possible He knows them and this cannot be happening

Richard looks back at the note touches the words

RON
(explodes LOUD)
What that shit fucking scrawl
signified means nothing I am not
the fucking same fool who wrote my
name on that AND NEITHER ARE
you Things change

Silence then

one
JONATHAN
You are certainly not the same
person Ron

RON
What the fuck does that mean

Jonathan raises his eyes lights a cigarette

RICHARD
So our bond means nothing to you
the promise all that was for
nothing Your dead friend

JONATHAN
It means we think about it

RON
It means I am not the same person
None of us are

The camera slows we all slow down TIME STOPS
We see Richard stare at the note
We see Ron SCREAM (silently)

We see Jonathan exhale cigarette smoke And the VOICE
objective and soothing curious

THE VOICE
Could they pinpoint the exact
moment in time they went from who
they were to who they had become
Was it at that moment that their
bonds became falsified And a more
burdensome question seem to present
itself it wasn’t whether or not
their annual meeting was a sham or
a ritual but whether or not the
countless days and nights and
minutes and hours that they were
apart was the sham and the ritual

RESUME SCENE
Jonathan exhales smoke looks at Ron
JONATHAN
You are not the same person the

same friend now Fuck you Ron

Ron backhands a vase off a table and it shatters against
wall

He sees a saucer with a pile of coke on it in front of

Richard

table

Richard

He grabs it does a line drops it on the kitchen

He rubs his face with both hands turns to them

RON
I’m a father I ama fucking
father

JONATHAN
And

RON

(to Jonathan)
So are you

invective in hand slams a huge slug of booze

RICHARD

It is all the result of measuring
little results against high
expectations He sees his son once
every two weeks and his son calls
his stepfather “dad”

(beat)
You write your name in blood and
what does it mean Your blood
means hooey Go home Ron Go home
to your mother go to your wife who
thinks you’re a God explain how
badly you disappointed failed
fucked up And how bad did you
fuck up Ron You greedy
cocksucker What did you do Are
you a bank robber Did you steal
people’s money

(Rich cocks and shoots

both his forefingers like

a gunslinger in the old

west)
You fucking bank robber Are you
like the hideous men we read about

(to Jonathan)
Jonathan did our little Ronnie go
bad on us

Ron stares at them calmly reaches into his pocket removes
his Blackberry dials listens

RON
Can I have the number for the local
police department

In one swift moment Richard lunges and snatches the phone
from Ron’s hand and hangs up

RICHARD
What the fuck are you doing

RON
(utterly calm)
Someone Committed Suicide The
police must be called a report
must be made

RICHARD
So your word is no good No
discussions

Jonathan is holding the note trembling now Clearly not
altogether not unusual considering

JONATHAN
It is who we are but if when we
wrote it we are not that now

RON
-let me get this straight I’m
supposed to follow through on some
twenty-five year old idealistic
bullshit I do not remember Are
you serious Richard This is not
how it works this is not relevant
to now Tim is dead

Richard holds up his hand gestures with each word

RICHARD
Exactly And You Signed It

With glazed eyes of chemical sadness Jonathan looks at Ron

JONATHAN
Our brains are wired wrong our
minds are unsound and not thinking
correctly Anything can happen
We are not rational now Ron We
are whistling in the dark We are
considering options

We return to this very unreal real world Haywire

RICHARD
Timmy died for his reasons Guilt
I know he could never forgive
himself But he did it

RON
(defensive)
He was weak

Richard moves menacingly towards Ron

RICHARD

(a vicious hiss)
It was his life His choice You
know what You’ve never followed
through on anything Even then
You know what we called you behind
your back Rat Ron ‘cause you
were a fucking rodent Selling us
tickets to concerts that you got
for free Trying to fuck
Jonathan’s girlfriend Rat fucking
Ron always playing THE MAN the
guy with the cash Tell me RAT
RON is that why you’re in so much
trouble

RON

You dirty little fucking loser
where’s your best-selling books
huh you fuck You forget when ‘rat
Ron’ got your fucking ass out of
jail in senior year because your
fucking mommy didn’t have the
money Fucking arty little
Richard always out of money And
I always had it that was my role
You were art and I was commerce
that’s what you used to say

(to Jonathan)
And how much money have I made for
you over the years you fucking
zombie quack fuck

Jonathan doesn’t answer Ron reaches for his Blackberry but
Richard jumps up and backs away into the kitchen scoots
behind the kitchen table uses it as a barrier as Ron
follows

RICHARD
It’s not only your decision to
make

Richard moves around the table He sees the saucer of blow
on the table He licks his fingertips and dips them in

He stops moving around the table waits for Ron When Ron is
right in front of him Richard raises his white-tipped coke
covered fingertips to Ron’s face

RICHARD (CONTD)
You are a man of numbers right
Ronny

Ron doesn’t answer

RICHARD (CONTD)

Let me lay it out for you I say
you have two choices Here or
there Because I have a feeling
that whatever shit you’re in it is
so deep it is going to fuck you in
the ass and swallow you whole

Ron is sweating He stops He tries to breath

RON

(quiet)
This is insane

(loud)
This IS INSANE

(hand over mouth as the

truth crashes into him)
Oh my God fucking Timmy

Ron’s freaked eyes bounce of Richard’s and Jonathans

JONATHAN
(gently)
I think you should leave Ron
I think it’s best

RICHARD
Yeah go home Ron LEAVE

Ron takes a deep breath Then another Jonathan approaches
the table leans over the saucer snorts with a rolled up
bill He is so high it is difficult to make it work

Ron breathes in and out in and out then

RON
I am packing up And I am going
home Let’s just agree that I left
before any of this happened

Richard and Jonathan nod Ron looks at them scared
RON (CONT’D)
(don’t do this)
Promise you’ll leave soon okay
They just look at him Ron suddenly grabs a chair from the
table lifts it and smashes it back down on the ground as he

lets out a guttural animal scream

Then he marches down the hallway to his room

Jonathan is tweaked He looks up at Richard Shivering
Dazed
JONATHAN

We have to do something about
Timmy

EXT HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER - LATE 92
AFTERNOON

Ron fumbles with keys to Tim’s rental car tries to unlock
the door He sweats He finally unlocks it tosses his bag
in the back gets behind the wheel backs out of the

driveway drives off

We follow FAST behind Ron tail Ron and then we are

INT RENTAL CAR - RON 93
We see his eyes his sweat hands on wheel rear view mirror
radio on LOUD forehead and chest sweating radio business
news playing then SLAMMED OFF

Silence Ron drives He tries to breath Rolls down a
window Grips the wheel

He looks like the most uncomfortable man in the world
until

He looks up Sees the SMALL TOWN AIRPORT THE WAY OUT

INT AIRPORT - DEPARTURES - AFTERNOON 94

Ron waits with a few other TRAVELERS He nervously looks at
his Blackberry Sees 33 MISSED CALLS Scans them

Most of them are from Amanda

He keeps scanning Sees “MOM”

He stares at that name “MOM”

Ron cracks He cries but it is inside he holds it inside

with the other pieces of his life he cannot look at in the
light of day

INT HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK 95

Music plays Jonathan makes a drink in the kitchen His
left hand is wrapped with gauze and tape from the shattered
shower door we see blood soaking through He walks us into
the

LIVING ROOM

Where Richard stands surrounded by the contents of Tim’s
travel bags and wallet Everything from boxer shorts to

socks to toothbrush and comb to books to business cards

Laid out on the floor

It looks like ART Jonathan looks at it all

RICHARD
This is all Tim’s

JONATHAN
Good Richard Very good

He looks at Tim’s belongings spread over the floor He nods

Richard squats picks up one of Tim’s shirts holds it to his
face and inhales Then he looks at Jonathan holds it out
as if to ask Jonathan if he wants to smell it as well
Jonathan simply stares at Richard

RICHARD
I’m glad Ron left His wife and

his God will help him through
whatever he’s gotten into

EXT HOUSE - ONE HOUR LATER - TWILIGHT 96

Jonathan and Richard Illuminated by the flickering flames
of a single torch

CLOSER

They stand over a 9x4 foot mound of fresh dirt They can
hear the ocean but not the person walking silently up behind
them

RON

It feels more like a dream or an apparition when he takes
his place next to them and stares into the flames

They do not acknowledge Ron nor does he want them to None
of them want to acknowledge what it means

We haltingly move toward them as they stare into the fire
THE IMAGE SLOWS as their faces become part of the glowing
fire a hallucinatory melding of element and human form a
painting of orange anguish reflection and crazed light

THE VOICE
When you are young imagining forty
or fifty years old is as abstract
as science fiction You are
sitting there and you are twenty-
one years old and you are
invincible It is all ahead of
you You are a horse with
blinders you only see ahead as you
whip yourself into a frenzy of
forward At some point something
turns those blinders inward A
death here a failed relationship
there You creep past thirty and
patterns emerge comforting and
killing at the same time
Experience and wisdom get blown
away by tragedy or the
inexplicable The hand of Fate
taps on the shoulders of those
around you and you pray and pray
that you are immune

STILL SLOW MOTION sand slides water flows eyes stare

THE VOICE (CONTD)
Your thirties fade You’re the
prime of definition as man worker
careerist actor in your own movie
creator lover in action how like
an angel in apprehension how like
a God You conquer and forge on a
string of victories that will never
end and then you hit it but at
first you don’t know what it is

(MORE )

Jonathan

THE VOICE (CONTD)
It could be the death of a parent
or the end of a marriage or the
birth of a flawed child and your
forties arrive and you try to feel
a sense of lightness and freedom
but it’s work like the marriage
and the job and the friendships and
the kids and the health issues and
nostalgia that suffocates you when
the old song comes on when the
picture falls from the photo album
when the scent of something takes
you back to when it wasn’t so hard
when all the self-help books in the
world cannot possibly save you
And you hate it when you admit that
someone else’s life is better than
yours even when yours is good

Richard and Ron slowly retreat We move in toward
the flames

THE VOICE (CONTD)
Is it good You wouldn’t know
because you are climbing and as
you climb you are scared higher
and wiser happier but fatter
richer lonelier depraved
stubborn loaded and still poorer
or richer Then you’ll see the
number 5-0 and the end is in view
You are formally officially
absolutely admittedly closer to the
end You panic dragged down by
the feeling that you have not
fulfilled the promise others
predicted for you the you promised
and prayed for You have no idea
but know things will change I
promise Just another promise
broken Lyrics to your song All
of them real

Paranoid

Ron and Richard at a table Unshaven
Black circles under their eyes

FADE OUT

Pale

Middle of lunch None of it eaten but they’re trying
Alcohol has replaced food chemistry has replaced balance

A beat later Captain Bob walks past on his way out
surprises them

CAPTAIN BOB
Hello

Three sets of eyes turn toward him - bleary paranoid numb

RICHARD
(tries to be light)
It’s Captain Bob

JONATHAN
How are you

CAPTAIN BOB
I’m fine
(then)
Where’s your buddy Tim

They hesitate way too long

RICHARD
Hehad something back in
Portland

JONATHAN

He had to take off
Captain Bob looks at them puzzled

CAPTAIN BOB
He told me he was staying for four
more days or something Must have
been disappointed to have to leave

Awkward beat Captain Bob cuts through it
CAPTAIN BOB (CONTD)
Don’t tell me he went home sour
‘cause he didn’t catch any fish
This breaks the ice
RON
(slurred)

That’s probably it

RICHARD
He was so embarrassed he ran home
97TA

JONATHAN
He told us he had some important
business

Captain Bob looks them over His sharp eyes take in
everything

CAPTAIN BOB
Well take care boys

--and ambles out of there The guys watch him leave then
look at each other

INT ROCKY WHARF DINER - TEN MINUTES LATER 97A
Out of the blue there’s a LOUD SCREAM and

WOMANS VOICE
Oh my God Oh my God

Jonathan’s dulled attention sharpens as he turns and sees

An OLD MAN (60-65) alone in a booth The man is in trouble
face going white neck going slack eyes closing He falls
to a knee on the ground

JONATHAN VAULTS OUT OF HIS SEAT and runs to the man

JONATHAN
(loud scream)
Someone call emergency

Seeing this guy with crazed bloodshot eyes and days of growth
on his face screaming in this small town frightens people -
everyone’s so stunned they don’t answer

JONATHAN (CONT’D)
(loud scream)
Now

The old man collapses on the ground Jonathan is wasted but
rising to the occasion

JONATHAN (CONT’D)
Guys

MANAGER holding a phone screams from the cash register

MANAGER
I got it I got emergency

Jonathan looks at the man’s chestit’s completely still
Richard and Ron are right there now

JONATHAN
Okay

slide him into the ambulance the men form a circle near a

doorway

Richard looks around to make sure nobody is watching
indicates the coke he has in a folded piece of paper

a bunch for him

At the very moment Jonathan snorts the Old Man’s Daughter
taps him on the shoulder catching him in the act He turns
to her

OLD MAN’S DAUGHTER
You saved my father’s life Thank
you
It is silent for a moment Jonathan knows
She has gratitude shock and repulsion doing battle in her
brain Jonathan wipes coke off his nose with the back of his

hand says this like he just remembered it

pills on the table

Jonathan and Richard are as wasted as we’ve seen them
Jonathan’s head bows forward and his eyelids close

RICHARD
Hey

Jonathan snaps awake

RICHARD (CONT’D)
You’re a mess Jonathan

Jonathan looks at him drunkenly begins mashing up pills
against the map of Big Sur with a knife Richard takes half
a teaspoon of cocaine from a baggy and dumps it on the pills

RICHARD (CONT’D)
You need it

JONATHAN
A spoonful of sugar makes the
medicine go down

Jonathan mixes the coke with the pills

JONATHAN (CONTD)
How long’s Ron been sleeping

line he just did He clears his throat

They are quiet a long time Ron swallows bitterly
RICHARD
I’m scared too

RON

Amanda left me messagesthey’re
in my home Richard The feds are
there

(looks at Richard)
I’ve robbed clients but I never
cheated on Amanda Never

(then head down)
At the beginning you’re helping
people enriching them Then it
gets inside you some rationale
and you take some extra for
yourself One zero becomes two
and more and more You get high
and you drift

Richard looks at him

RICHARD
And you can’t recognize yourself

Ron covers his head Richard moves to him

Beat

RICHARD (CONTD)
Why did you need so much

RON
I don’t know
(defensive)
I love taking care of my family
was the man I really was the man
for awhile I wish you could have
seen me Richard

RICHARD
Will she forgive you

RON
Nobody will

RICHARD
I love you Ron

RON
You said you were scaredyou
don’t act like it

I

RICHARD (CONTD)
I read something once that made me
think about the note ‘Cowardice
masquerades as courage in
motivating people to not do it’
But I lie and I hide

Ron turns to him

RON
Do it for me
RICHARD
(strong)
Fuck you Ron
RON
Please
RICHARD
No
RON
I can’t do it
RICHARD
Don’t
RON
I have to
RICHARD

Ron takes a deep breath Exhales

RON

I want tobutI have tried to
see myself going home and facing
it I’ve imagined her seeing me
looking into me my eyes I can’t
face that

(beat)
We are destitute

They sit there It’s a long moment The longest we can
handle Richard doesn’t look at Ron when he says

RICHARD
Lie down On the bed

Ron does Puts his hands at his sides Richard stands
looks down at Ron
RICHARD (CONTD)
Are you sure

Ron nods Tears rolling

RON
Remember how we met

Richard crawls on the bed straddles Ron

RON (CONTD)
I thought you were the biggest
asshole But cool

Richard looks at him Ron speaks gently

RON (CONTD)
And I felt sorry for you This
dark guy with a dead dad

Richard picks up a pillow from beside Ron’s head

RON (CONTD)
You were the most interesting guy
in the dorm You turned me on to
Holiday In Cambodia Remember

Richard holds the pillow to his own chest He nods

well in his eyes

RON (CONTD)
And I turned you on to The
Pretenders

RICHARD
Stop now

RON
You remember that

Richard nods

RICHARD
Stop talking now

RON

(speaks it softly)
You arrived like a day and passed
like a cloud I made a wish I said
it out loud out loud in a crowd
everybody heard “twas the talk of
the town”

(beat)
You loved that song

Tears

Their eyes are locked He slowly brings the pillow down over
Ron’s face Richard applies pressure Ron’s hands stay limp
at his sides

We hear a muffled groan from beneath the pillow and Ron’s
hands raise try to fight off Richard His fingernails dig
into Richards forearms and draw blood Richard uses every
ounce of strength he has

Finally Ron’s body goes limp Richard looks down at Ron’s
hands as they fall away from his forearms

He slowly crawls off Ron leaves the pillow over his face
Richard sits on the bed next to Ron

Then he rests his head on Ron’s chest

He stays there a moment His voice is a soft cracked whisper
when he tries to sing more of the Pretenders song “it’s not
my place to know what you feel I’d like to know but why
should I”

Richard stands walks out

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 105
Jonathan looks up with glazed eyes at Richard

Richard slowly shakes his head “no” Jonathan and Richard
stare at each other for a long beat Jonathan’s eyes find
the fingernail cuts on Richard’s forearms

Jonathan seems to sense what has happened

EXT HOUSE - NEAR THE BACK DECK - NIGHT 106

Jonathan and Richard stand by a mound of dirt next to Tim’s
grave Richard lights a torch with a match and a huge ball
of fire forces them back

The camera slowly pushes through the fire and Richard puts
his arm around Jonathan leans in close and whispers in the
flickering orange light

VOICE
He has better things in store
beyond anything you could think or
ask

(MORE )

VOICE (CONTD)
The dying is a sheer kindness to
the black soul Not a light But
a step by shallow step welcome our
menace and shadow Listen to me
the beginning of the end is quiet
and velvet This is the perfect
failure

And the two friends lean on each other knowing

Three-hundred feet above the sea We see Boyde emerge from a
small sheriffs office She takes in the view as walks
toward a picnic table

A FEW MINUTES LATER

Boyde sits with her sister KATIE Nearby Katie’s two BOYS
STEVIE and MATT play on the grass

BOYDE
It’s funny isn’t it How you can’t
predict what anyone is going to end
up like

KATIE
Well you can kind of I mean
Stevie’s like his dad mechanical
And Matt’s just creative as
anything

BOYDE
I know he is I still have the
drawing of the rabbit he did up in
my office He’s a bit of a charmer
too

They look at Matt He’s lost in the sensation of running a
blade of grass over his nose

BOYDE (CONT’D)
I’m glad I never had children

Katie turns to her tries to guess what she means by this
KATIE

Youre afraid youd be a bad
mother

BOYDE
No no All the worry all the
fear you must have Everything is
so random

KATIE
It’s a trade off
(then)
You don’t get love without fear
BOYDE
(nodding)

True
A beat while they watch the boys

BOYDE (CONT’D)
Where are the men Katie

Katie’s eyes widen this is not the kind of question she’s
used to from her sister

KATIE
Well if Jeff’s any measure I scare
mine away If that’s what you
mean

BOYDE
You didn’t scare him away All
three of you did The family

KATIE
I don’t know if I ever expected
more maybe that’s the problem

BOYDE
I didn’t mean that anyway I meant
why do they run and shut us out
(then)
And then say we’re skittish

Katie turns to her

BOYDE (CONT’D)
(gently)
Don’t look at me like that I
don’t hate men I love them
(then)
It’s just that they expect you to
be there and then they dissolve
right in front of you

KATIE
They disappear

Matt turns toward Boyde stares at her

BOYDE
Youd think there would be a lot
more people in love than there are

Matt makes his way to her a sweet smile on his face He
holds out his hand says one simple word

MATT
Play

And takes her hand She stands smiles back at Katie as Matt
pulls her out on the grass

BOYDE
Told you he was a charmer

fistful of refrigerator magnets with life affirmation quotes
“he who limps is still walking” and “do not let what you
cannot do interfere with what you can do” and “Your attitude
determines your altitude”

Richard raises his eyes to Jonathan A wave of feeling
washes over him An acknowledgement An imperceptible nod

JONATHAN (CONTD)

Richard stares at him It’s possible that Richard doesn’t
know what Jonathan means but then

JONATHAN (CONTD)
Run with me Richard
(then)
Can you run with me

Jonathan turns and jogs away
Richard stares after him

Richards eyes brighten and become child-like as he watches
Jonathan running through the trees

He takes off after him
We don’t follow

We stay back until they become smalluntil they almost look
like little boys

RICHARD
-you remember in college when

was cleaning out all my Mom’s stuff
last year I found the ticket stub
in an old box -- it was Modern
English The Cure and XTC and some
other bands

RICHARD (CONTD)

(beat)
We were so HIGH Remember We
couldnt even like fucking speak
And Modern English was singing that
song

(sings)
dropped in the state of
imaginary grace

JONATHAN
(softly singing the
background vocal of the
song)
You should know better

RICHARD

(resuming)
I remember I felt these strange
rays of lightand it was coming
from you guys from your eyes and
I was so fucking happy And it
wasn’t this forced happinessit
was honest and calmfuck man it
was so pure all these dreams that
felt real like they could happen

(can’t find the words)
I lived on that image for days it
was like it was burned into my
brain like I was still high from
the drug and you guys but it
wasn’t the drugs it was us and I
never forgot it

(long beat)
I’ve never been that happy since
I’ve never even been close

Richard trails off He turns away toward the sea The wind
rises against them

Jonathan watches as Richard walks closer to the edge of the
cliff He stares at Richard’s back Looks down at how close
Richard’s feet are to the edge of the cliff

Jonathan silently stands up

Beat

Jonathan EXPLODES toward Richard lays a fierce tackle on him
at chest-height They fly over the cliff And disappear

We hear ocean pounding the rocks below

We creep toward the edge and by degrees the sky fades into a
deeper color of blue and we are suddenly in mid-flight with

the wind-catching effect of a parachute

JONATHAN

“Never too late for redemption”
I love it

Richard and Jonathan float gently toward an animated flat
rock on the shore Richard looks down

RICHARD
Look we’re going to land nice and
soft

JONATHAN

This is so incredible

RICHARD
The happy ending we all wish for is
going to come true

Distant high pitched whistling Approaching fast

JONATHAN
Everybody loves a happy ending

RICHARD
Especially after a massage

Jonathan and Richard gently touch down on the rock huge
smiles pasted on their faces

RICHARD (CONTD)
To new beginnings

JONATHAN
Things are going to get better
after all

They raise their hands in preparation for a “high five”

RICHARD
Let’s live out our very own fairy
tales

They slap five Whistling grows LOUDER

Something from the sky Jonathan and Richard look up
Their happy animated smiles transform to stunned dread

RICHARD JONATHAN
(unison)
Oh shit

A huge flat rock like that of a Roadrunner cartoon falls with
blazing speed SQUASHES them with a HUGE BLOODY CARTOON
SPLAT

BACK TO REALITY 131
Jonathan leans over the cliff wasted grin on his face
Richard turns toward him

JONATHAN
Let’s go home

EXT HOUSE - HOUR LATER - DUSK 132

Night is falling in the sky behind the house

INT LIVING ROOM - DUSK 133

Everything is silent

INT HOUSE - JONATHAN’S ROOM - DUSK 134

Jonathan shirt soaked in sweat shaking a little tries to
muster sobriety as he dials his cell

JONATHAN

INTERCUTTING —- JANE - IN HER APARTMENT - SAME 135
JANE

JONATHAN
Thanks Jane

Miles comes to the phone

MILES
Hi

JONATHAN

MILES
Hi

JONATHAN
How is everything

MILES
Good

JONATHAN

That’s good

MILES
(suddenly excited)
Daddy took me in a helicopter
yesterday because he had to meet
someone for lunch

Jonathan Crushed on the word “Daddy”

MILES (CONTD)
I was a only a little scared

JONATHAN
Miles I’m your Daddy Daniel is
your stepfather

MILES
We could see the whole city

JONATHAN
Do you know that

Jonathan’s eyes are welling up but he fights it back

MILES
What

JONATHAN
Daniel is your step-father Miles
I’m your father

Jane crosses through the room in the bg slips into a coat

JANE

Say goodbye Miles We have to go
MILES

Oh
JONATHAN

Promise me you won’t forget that
Okay Miles Please

MILES
I have to go Mom said

JONATHAN
(as Miles hangs up)
Okay Miles I love you
Jonathan slumps on the edge of the bed cell phone in his
hands He sets his cell phone on the dresser next to his
stethoscope

JONATHAN (CONTD)
I love you son

He picks it up places the earpiece into his ear canals
presses the chest-piece against his heart

There is nothing but silence

INT JONATHAN’S ROOM - THIRTY MINUTES LATER - DUSK-EVENING6

Jonathan lies on the bed belt wrapped tightly around his
upper arm and a needle stuck in his arm

His eyes are just closing as we go to

JONATHAN POV - THE CEILING 137

Slowly transforming into a projection screen for the home
movie playing in his chemically altered mind

It’s a movie with Jonathan and Miles two years earlier ona
beach at water’s edge in the sun

Images are dream-like They play a game of TAG Jonathan
deftly but barely escaping Miles’ touch They are both
laughing hysterically until he slips and Miles is suddenly
upon him

Miles voice sounds distant he says the same thing over and
over and the sound of it fills Jonathan with joy

Instead of “I love you more than anything in the whole wide
world” Miles has his three year old’s shorthand
MILES
I love you in the whole wide
worldI love you in the whole
wide worldI love you in the

whole wide world

Miles and Jonathan roll in the sand at water’s edge overcome
by pure joy as a wave slaps the shore and washes over them

And then the screen in Jonathan’s mind bleeds to BLACK

INT HALLWAY - HOUR LATER - NIGHT 138
Richard stands at the end of the hallway staring

He walks toward us like he is trying to be utterly silent
When he passes us we go to-

RICHARDS POV

Walking down the hall and into

INT JONATHANS ROOM - DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS 139
Richard stares through bloodshot eyes at Jonathan

Jonathan is ghostly white with a syringe stuck in his arm
He’s half on the bed and half off

He is not breathing

Richard turns away rests his forehead against the door
frame

RICHARD
I came to tell you I cannot do
this
He stays there a long moment He walks to Jonathan gently

lifts his feet off the floor and up onto the bed
He removes the syringe and belt from his arm

RICHARD (CONTD)
There you go buddy

He looks at his friend and walks out of the room

The SOUND OF A DIGGING SHOVEL brings us to

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT 140

Richard fills in a hole next to Tim and Ron’s graves
Sweating and breathing hard This is the everything The
dream we see and deny the darkness coming to all of us that
lives within us the day we all pretend will never come

Richard is the ultimate loneliness

THE VOICE
--each day demands we create our
whole world over disguising the
constant horror in a coat of many-
colored fictions we mask our past
in the green of Eden pretend
futures shining fruit can sprout
from the navel of this present
waste In faith we shall board our
imagined ship and sail among
sacred islands of the mad till
death shatters the fabulous stars
and makes us real

FADE OUT

INT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT 141

Deafening music Richard chews a variety of pills like
candy washing them down with beer Richard is painting

His movements are unnaturally jerky What started as a copy
of the little kid Bobby’s painting which has been ripped
from its frame and taped to the wall has grown into a huge
twisted allegorical mural across the windows of the living
room

It is of himself of his life and his endfour mounds of
dirt the end image of a man jumping over the cliff

The caption of the mural is best friends forever and there
are other smaller texts weaved into the mural “stick to your
word” and “a deal’s a deal” “Ian Sylvia” and “the last
autonomous act” and “criminal and victim are the same” and “if
this is cowardice what is courage”

RICHARD (VO)
We are lost and we are liars we
fill the hole

(MORE )

RICHARD (VO) (CONTD)
Lick it suck it smoke it snort
it fuck it eat it kill it push
it down and it’s still there We
are the stroke the follow through
This is it This is the
everything the beginning middle
and end

Richard is deranged he has entered a different zone of
thought and space and time

INT POLICE STATION - MORNING 142
Boyde speaks with another OFFICER (STEVENS 50 MALE)

BOYDE
Well I want to get in there but
I’1l need a warrant

STEVENS
Is it drugs

BOYDE
Yes And it’d gotten out of
control It’s not recreational

Boyde thinks

BOYDE (CONTD)
What if I went to Judge Bendis and
said they’re dealing

STEVENS
(raises eyebrows good
idea)

Stevens nods The phone rings Boyde picks it up

BOYDE (CONT’D)

INT TIM’S LOFTAPARTMENT - KITCHEN - PORTLAND - EARLY 143
MORNING

The Woman Lisa we saw at the beginning stands in Tim’s
apartment a cell phone pressed to her ear She has opened
the envelope that Tim left called “Lisa 2” and she’s holding
a note Lisa is in total shock

WOMAN
(voice quivering)
I need to speak to the Police
About Tim Arthurs Something he
wrote

INT POLICE STATION - MORNING 144

Laura Boyde listens

By degrees we see her expression digest and go dark as she
tries to comprehend what this Lisa is telling her

Stevens watches Boyde hangs up and bolts out of the office

STEVENS

EXT HIGHWAY ONE - BOYDE’S VEHICLE 145

Races past

INT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER - MORNING6

Richard’s bloodstream coursing with a volatile mixture of
chemicals and alcohol He is talking quietly to himself on
the living room floor as he stares at his mural while
listening to “Kyoko’s House” By Philip Glass full blast

He holds his knees close to his chest and rocks His rocking
appears to be a way to not become ill or stay on some line
of thought in his mind or hold back some terrible pain being
born inside of him

The little boy’s painting is on the floor by his feet as are
Richard’s shoes and a bottle of wine He looks between the
painting and the mural

Hard banging on the door He turns toward it He tries to
say something but nothing comes out

The door opens He turns sees Boyde there She walks in
She stops cold at the site of the mural

RICHARD
Do you like it

It is like she cannot take her eyes off it Or speak She
scans the room Sees the drugs

RICHARD (CONTD)
(re drugs)
Have some

With the music blasting and mural she can FEEL the
atmosphere in here the darkness and vanished presences

BOYDE
I need to know where your friends
are

Richard starts putting on one of his shoes Boyde moves to
stereo turns off the music Pure silence for a beat The
silence has it’s own hellish feel Boyde stares at Richard

RICHARD
Are you here to save me

Richard takes a large slug from the wine bottle Holds it up
for Boyde She shakes her head

Richard puts the bottle down looks at the little boy’s
painting picks it up holds it up to her

RICHARD (CONTD)

Can this keep me alive all by

itself Can you You have love

inside of you I couldve
(beat)

I could’venevernever

Boyd is shocked by his state Richard gathers himselfa
little

RICHARD (CONTD)

But my friendsI loved them But
after awhile do you even know
them When you get sucked down
into your lives you don’t

Richard stops and the world blurs

RICHARD (CONTD)

Do you feel time racing I feel
it You’re a woman I know you do
How would we really know if it was
moving faster Would you

Richard closes his eyes

RICHARD (CONTD)
I’m closer

He moves towards her Richard looks at the ragged piece of
paper with his friends writing staring at him On the
table picks it up

RICHARD (CONTD)
(then)
I loved them I thought about them
when I was weak but it only made me
feel weaker because

She looks at his red eyes bloody

RICHARD (CONTD)
-because you can’t have the past
back No no no and they
reminded me of the past Sol
rejected themevery time we were
together none of us were present
Wasted Always wasted

Richard drinks from the wine bottle

RICHARD (CONTD)
We didn’t do what we said we’d do

He tosses the bottle aside

RICHARD (CONTD)
Maybe all this

(what has happened here)
-was our way of saying we
remembered what we used to feel

(beat)

That means something doesn’t it

He starts putting on his other shoe

RICHARD (CONTD)
You wanna know where my friends
are They’re dead They’re in the
back Buried beneath the sand

When the words hit Boyde it’s like something in her deflects
them or pushes them away

The unspeakable truth
She looks at him

RICHARD (CONTD)
I’m surprised you didn’t notice
before What kind of cop are you
anyway I mean you walked out
there Remember

Boyde’s face changesby degrees her expression grows
darker

RICHARD (CONT’D)
Here’s one Jimmy Swaggart calls up
Billy Graham and says “Billy can
prostitutes be saved” And Billy
says with religious fire in his
voice “Jimmyevery single one of
us can be saved” And Jimmy says to
Billy “good then save me one for
Saturday night”

Richard laughs to himself Boyde looks between Richard and
the back door

RICHARD (CONTD)
I’m going to make you now a light
for the whole world I swear to you
that I am not lying
EXT BEACH HOUSE - BACK PATIO - NIGHT 147

Boyde steps outside Smoldering embers on Jonathan’s grave
She walks toward it tentatively

She sees charred remnants of wallets credit cards and
clothes cash toothbrushes shoes over the outline of three
man-sized graves

BOYDE’S FACE

Undergoes lethal transformation Disbelief Fear Nausea

Realization

She buckles puts her hands on her knees there is not enough
airshe rises and

Boyde suddenly HEARS a MOTOR REVVING---

INT BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT 148
-Boyde bursts inside bolts through the empty living room to
the front door

EXT BEACH HOUSE - FRONT YARD - NIGHT 149

Boyde sees the Porsche tearing out of driveway runs and
jumps into her squad car races after Richard’s car

EXT PORSCHE - MOVING
Tail lights of the Porsche BLOW BY HEADING TOWARDS THE
OCEAN the road looming in the distance

INT BOYDE’S SQUAD CAR - MOVING 151
She guns her engine to keep up Her eyes are shocked and
moist

EXT HIGHWAY
Boyde’s squad car BLOWS BY races after Richard’s Porsche

INT RICHARD’S PORSCHE - MOVING FAST 153
Richard dead stare wine bottle stuck between his knees
Over his shoulder we see him approaching the hill the same
rising epic view of his painting the end of the world

EXT PT SUR LIGHTHOUSE 154
The Porsche enters the awe inspiring vista the road leading
to the top of the lighthouse

INT SQUAD CAR - BOYDE’S FACE 155
Boyde sees where he is heading the highest point of the
coast

INT PORCHE - SAME 156
Richard is looking out the dangerous cliff side right
outside his window he yells in a gutteral release

EXT PORSCHE - WINDING ROAD-PT SUR LIGHTHOUSE 157
We see how close to the edge and dangerously high we are
going

INT SQUAD CAR - BOYDE’S POV 158

The Porsche disappears around the winding road up the hill

INT PORSCHE - SAME 159

Richard sees something up ahead

EXT THE TWO CARS 160

Racing One behind the other Up the hill to the top

INT PORSCHE - SAME 161

Richard’s eyes are wide and burning Intense Focused
Scared

The nose of the car climbs toward the top of the horizon
line Beyond that all there is only the sky

Richard skids to a stop At the edge of the cliff We see
it as he does

THE TOP OF THE COAST THE END OF THE WORLD EXACTLY LIKE THE
BOYS PAINTING

INT SQUAD CAR - BOYDE 162

Her face ashen as she approaches and sees Richard’s car

EXT PT SUR LIGHTHOUSE
Boyde’s heart is racing She gets out Walks towards the
still idling Porsche ominously perched near the edge a
small thin fence it’s only defense to a 300 foot plunge
Boyde knows this place very well It’s her place her
domain Her ability to see everything from this vantage
point is now turning back to her

She walks to the car door slightly ajar and peers inside the
darkened window-

She slowly opens it
It is empty

And looks down on the seat she’s a piece of small tattered
piece of paper

THE NOTE

She reads it the words sinking her clarity overwhelming
her the world turning upside down

The end of the pact the final friend
BOYDE
Oh my God
EXT PT SUR LIGHTHOUSE 164

Boyde runs up the hill past the steep descending wooden
stairs and looks in the distance as

RICHARD-—

Walks towards the edge of the bluff the sea and world
beneath him endless and infinite

Richard looks over at Boyde Her worst fears being seen
realized

They stare at each other

Richard takes a large pull off the wine bottle THROWS IT
OFF INTO THE SEA

Richard looks out at the sky the ocean Up at the world
Looking down at him

Then he looks at her

She sees him Witnesses it Walks slowly towards him palms
unfurling

Richard stares at her His eyes are welling up He fights
this urge

HE MOVES CLOSER THE WORLD AND WIND SWIRLING

His feet are inches from the edge She slowly comes even
closer

No words only this gesture the simplest one man has ever
known

It is subtle small instinctive She slowly begins to open
her arms towards him

And he sees this and turns away looking out to the sea

RICHARD
It’ssofuckingbeautiful

Boyde does not take her eyes off Richard Richard looks back
from the cliff

And into her eyes
RICHARD (CONTD)
(softly)
And I am so goddamm scared
But in this fire in his eyes she knows

She slowly shakes her head it doesn’t have to come to this

OFFICER BOYDE
No Richard

He smiles a beautiful smile at her
RICHARD
Id miss my friends too much
(beat)
And a deal’s a deal

He looks over at Boyde He closes his eyes and breathes
Inside where he knows the view the end

RICHARD (CONTD)
So I don’tso I don’t have to
see

Richard opens his eyes Wide He moves to jump-

OFFICER BOYDE
Don’t

Boyde suddenly rushes towards himtheir eyes lockone
split second

The world stops

Richard leaps off of the cliff

And sails into the sky

And drops out of sight

She stares toward the cliff

Silence Except for the sound of waves crashing below
She hesitates then walks to the edge

She stops She doesn’t look down

She just stares straight out to the sea

Then slowly she turns her eyes toward the approaching night
sky feeling that she is the only person left at the end of
the world

FADE OUT

TITLE THE BEGINNING

DISSOLVE TO - THE GRADUATION CEREMONY - SLOW MOTION 165

We are at the beginning in 1984 moving behind the
silhouette of the four guys around the back to the
beginning

Richard Ron Jonathan and Richard come into focus laughing
in their graduation gowns amid the celebration

They look into one another’s smiling eyes

They throw their arms around each other in a joyous group

embrace inadvertently lose their balance and tumble over

folding chairs to the ground laughing stumbling falling
all the way to the end
