FADE IN
ON A 10-METER DIVING PLATFORM

A young man’s bare feet step onto the edge of the
platform facing backwards

Every muscle in his athletic legs is tense
He slightly adjusts his swimwear

He dries a few drops of sweat from his hands on his
defined bare chest and raises his arms above his body

His green eyes stare blankly ahead concentrating This
is AARON RIESLING He takes one final deep BREATH thrusts his body up

He hugs his extended legs very close to his chest and
rotates forward Once Twice His face shows all the
strength necessary to perform these seemingly easy
movements

He lets go of his legs opens up his body and stretches
his arms like an arrow over his head

He dives into the water with precision SPLASHING very
little

UNDERWATER

Aaron lets out all the air in his lungs and swims up to
the surface

Aaron rises from the water and steps out of the pool
This is the pool area of a gym fully equipped for diving
practice with springboards and platforms

MARK RIESLING Aaron’s father and coach hands him a
towel Mark still has the build of an athlete but his
tired eyes give away his age

HERALD PIERCE African American friendly face sits
on a bench at a distance He smiles at Aaron and
discreetly nods in approval

MARK
You’re still angling on the
entrance you open up too soon
And you gotta watch those legs
keep’em close to your body
Straight
Aaron dries himself silently

MARK (CONTD)
That’s enough for today Go hit
the shower

Aaron exchange glances with Herald and walks away

his eyes trying to relax

Mark throws him a shocked look

AARON (CONTD)
The guys are going to San Diego
for the weekend and--

MARK
Well “the guys” are not athletes
They can afford to waste their
weekends

AARON
They’re not wasting it They’re
just-- Never mind

MARK
Do you want to make it to the
Olympics or not

AARON
Of course

MARK
Then you’re gonna have to

shelves and a few pictures here and there

Aaron walks in from his room sleepy wearing a
sweatsuit He sits across from his dad and serves
himself two pieces of toast and an apple

Mark takes one of the toasts off of Aaron’s plate with a
sharp look and puts it back on the center plate They
eat in silence

INT DIVING AREA - RIESLING GYM - EARLY MORNING

MARK
(hesitates)
At a party

AARON
Why did you two get divorced

MARK
Didn’t we have this conversation

AARON

“We fell out of love” is not
really an explanation Dad

MARK
(hesitates)
Life is made of choices Aaron

covered notebook A black cardboard box is open next to
him As soon as he sees Aaron Mark quickly hides the
notebook back in the box

AARON
Dad come on we’re gonna be late

The whole point of knocking is
that you wait for the other person
to say “come in” before you enter

Mark puts the box back into his closet

EXT CLIFF - SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA - AFTERNOON

Mark and Aaron stand at the top of a cliff Mark
contemplates the inviting water 30 feet below them The
landscape is much more inspiring than the structured
platforms and springboards over the diving pool

AARON
How’s thatcelebrating

MARK
Are you kidding me You would beg
to come here with me every time
Id come dive

AARON
Yeah like a decade ago

MARK

enjoy it You and me diving like
in the old days

AARON
Dad diving is all I do
Everyday
MARK
Isn’t that what you love doing
AARON
Yes It’s just-- I’ve been

practicing non-stop for weeks and
you said we were going
celebrating I thoughtwe were
going out for some fish and chips or
something
MARK

You know you can’t eat that

(beat)

Don’t you wanna sweep that gold in
the Olympics If you wanna be
someone you gotta make some
sacrifices You don’t wanna end
up like your old man

AARON
(bothered)

What are you talking about You

MARK
You can do better

A moment

MARK

yourself

The other day you asked what was
the nicest place I’ve ever dived
This is certainly one of them

Mark looks down at the water

MARK
Do you wanna dive

MARK
Of course now

Aaron looks at the water

AARON

The water must be freezing

MARK

Mark takes off his socks his
stripped down to his boxers
looks back at Aaron

pants his T-shirt He’s
He approaches the edge

MARK
See you down there

Mark dives arms wide open His body flies like a
falcon until it disappears into the water

Aaron watches from above He waits for Mark to emerge
And waits
And waits

Finally Mark’s unconscious body rises to the surface
Aaron can’t believe his eyes

AARON
(yells)
Dad Dad

Aaron stands at the edge of the cliff He considers
jumping but steps back and rushes down the cliff

EXT SHORE BY THE CLIFF - SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA - AFTERNOON

As Aaron approaches the water he yanks his shoes off and
dives into the water swimming desperately towards Mark

AARON
Dad

He reaches him raises his head above water gives hima
few slaps Nothing

He drags his father’s body to the shore shakes him
trying desperately to revive him Nothing

Panic taking over him he applies CPR Still nothing
He reaches for his phone in his pocket It’s soaking

wet He presses a few buttons but it won’t turn on He
flings it to the ground

He goes back to the body knowing there’s nothing much he
can do He looks around not a single soul in sight

AARON
(at the top of his
lungs )
HELP SOMEONE HELP ME

INT CHAPEL - FUNERAL HOME - DAY

Mark’s body lies peacefully inside an open coffin A
large picture of Mark in his late 20s wearing a silver
medal is placed among flowers next to the coffin

Several MOURNERS attend the funeral Herald mingles with
some of Mark’s FELLOW DIVERS Some of Aaron’s FRIENDS
from school are also present

Aaron dressed in a suit sits by himself on the first
pew lost in his thoughts Julia and Josh walk up to
him Josh taps his shoulder--

JOSH
Hang in there man I’m here if
you need me OK

Aaron nods Julia gently kisses his cheek wanders away
KARL GOLDMAN (50s) also approaches Aaron

KARL
My deepest sympathies Your
father was a great man

Herald walks up to Aaron and kneels down

HERALD
How are you doing

AARON
Alright

HERALD

It’s time
It takes a moment for Aaron to stand up

HERALD
You don’t have to do it if you
don’t want to

Aaron nods and heads to the front of the chapel where a
microphone is positioned on a stand

All eyes are on him Silence He stares at the
mourners “Who are these people”

AARON
My father--
(deep breath)
My fatherwas a great diver

He pauses The silence is overwhelming
AARON
He was a great diver
(starts to laugh)
That’s it

The mourners exchange quizzical looks
AARON

That’s all I know about him
Isn’t that great

(beat)
No wait that’s not fair I know
more than that Let’s see He

was eighteen when he first went to
the Olympics he won a total of
six Olympic medals -- two bronze
four silver never the gold -- and
for that he always saw himself as
a failure

Aaron looks around the chapel

AARON
Why are we even in a chapel My
father wasn’t a religious man
Was he Does anyone here know

Herald looks away It’s too hard for him to watch it

AARON
(points at Karl)
Hey you You said my father was a
great man Why is that What was
so great about him

Karl stares back at him sadly Everyone’s discomfort

has reached an unbearable level

AARON
(comes to his senses)
I-- I’m sorry

He steps away from the microphone Herald runs after

him

HERALD
Aaron

He’s already gone

INT LIVING ROOM - RIESLING’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Aaron sits on the couch remote control in hand
small figure adrift in a lifeless house

He’s a

ON TV--

A video from the Olympic Games of ‘88 in Seoul plays
The lettering shows Mark’s name the name of the jump
and the level of difficulty

Mark concentrates runs from the 10-meter platform and
executes a forward 3-12 somersault tuck The AUDIENCE
CHEERS

As Mark emerges to the surface he shakes his fist
celebrating The scores come up on the screen mainly
10s He’s in the first position -- for now The crowd
CHEERS even louder

Mark opens up huge smile He waves and mouths “I love
you” to the crowd

COMMENTATOR (VO)
(excited)
With just one vault left after
this perfect dive only a big
mistake can take the gold away
from Mark Riesling
The video is rewound

Once more Mark waves and mouths “I love you” to the
crowd

The video is rewound again

BACK TO AARON--

--with the remote control pointed to the VCR rewinding

the same bit over and over again his teary eyes fixated
on the screen

INT PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - AARON’S HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

A sign on the dark hardwood table reads

“LIONEL COOPER PRINCIPAL”

Aaron sits across from LIONEL (50s) bald and friendly

LIONEL
Thanks for seeing me

Aaron nods
LIONEL
I just wanted to extend my deepest
sympathies and tell you that we
are here for anything you need
You can come and talk to me
anytime you want

AARON
Thanks

LIONEL
Also we have a counselor
available she might be able to
help you

AARON
I’m alright

LIONEL
The help of a professional can be
really useful in a time like this
I know how you feel

Aaron remains silent for a moment then points at a
Christmas family portrait on the desk

AARON
Is this your wife

LIONEL
Yes that’s my wife Jane And
these are my daughters Elizabeth
and Karen

AARON
Let’s imagine you’re coming back
from a nice family dinner with
Jane You guys are getting along
she’s actually happy like she
hasn’t been in a long time
Suddenly you’re involved in an
accident and she goes unconscious
You try to help her you do CPR
but it doesn’t help You try to
call for help but your phone
won’t work of course why would
it

Aaron leans forward getting closer to Lionel’s face

AARON
You wait for hours holding a dead
body until someone shows up to
help

(MORE )

AARON (CONTD)

And then imagine that a few days
later when you go back to work a
guy that has never once talked to
you before comes to you and says

(with the utmost

cynicism)
“There there I know how you
feel”

Lionel takes it all in quietly

AARON
Can you imagine that

Lionel stares deep into Aaron’s defying eyes hesitates
and finally--

LIONEL
My wife killed herself two years
ago

Aaron freezes Lionel keeps staring at him Aaron
storms off

EXT CLIFF - SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA - DAY

Aaron stands on the top of the cliff from where his
father dove He gets closer to the edge looks down at
water gently brushing the rocks below

Is he gonna jump

He stares at the spot where Mark’s lifeless body emerged

As he looks at the ground next to him he notices his
father’s tennis shoe abandoned amidst some rocks

He takes it in his hand as if it were a precious
fragile object gazes at it for a long time and finally
breaks into a silent CRY

INT WAITING ROOM - LAW FIRM - DAY

Aaron sits quietly He notices a WOMAN (30s) sitting
across from him trying hard not to cry After a long
awkward silence the woman can’t hold it anymore and
starts SOBBING

WOMAN
I’m sorry It’s just-- this
divorce-- it’s just killing me

Karl steps into the waiting room

KARL
Aaron Riesling

Aaron stands up recognizing the man from the funeral

INT LAWYER’S OFFICE - DAY

Aaron sits across the table from Karl He looks around
at the shelves upon shelves of law books

KARL
Again I’m sorry for your loss

Aaron nods

KARL
Your father was doing pretty well
And by the way he has arranged
things you can certainly tell he
was thinking about your future

AARON
You bet

Karl smiles confused and hands Aaron a folder

KARL
These are all your father’s assets
and properties Since you’re his
only heir there wont be any
issues It should all be yours --
the gym the house everything

Aaron skims through the folder apathetically

AARON
Is that all

KARL
(hesitates)
At the funeral you asked me what
was so great about your father

Aaron looks down ashamed

KARL
Mark was the most righteous man
I’ve ever known The right way
was the only way for him which is
something I certainly can’t say
about many of my clients
(smiles)
I doubt Mark ever ran a red light

Aaron doesn’t find it funny

KARL
Anyway I can only imagine how
hard this all must be for you but
try to hold on to the good things

AARON
What good things

KARL

Well I understand you have a
promising diving career ahead of
you that’s one thing

(indicates the

folder)
Youre financially safe for at
least a few good years

(beat)
I know this seems like nothing in
a moment like this but it is
something It’s something to keep
you going

Aaron ponders it

INT MARK’S ROOM - RIESLING’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Aaron walks in carrying several empty cardboard boxes

He needs a moment to process all the objects that have no
use for anymore He puts the boxes on floor and steps
into the closet

He gazes at all his father’s clothes that he’1ll have to
deal with He fiddles with them for a moment then
reaches for the top shelf grabs a stack of winter
clothes and drops them in one of the boxes

As he reaches for the second stack on the shelf he finds
the black cardboard box He pulls it out of the closet
puts it on the bed intrigued

He opens it finds a leather journal inside -- it’s the
notebook Mark was looking at earlier He carefully pulls
it out and studies it for a moment before summoning up
courage to open it The first page reads

“THE 4-OCEAN JOURNEY”

Below the words there’s a map with four cities marked
with red circles

Barrow Alaska Acapulco Mexico Jericoacoara Brazil
and Broome Australia

Aaron reads the next page

MARK (VO)
It took us long enough but here
we are Today Diana and I start
our dream journey Four oceans in
four months The Pacific the
Atlantic the Indian and the
Arctic There’s no other person
Id rather be with She was
right the world is big
beautiful and ours

Aaron keeps turning the pages drawn to every word A
postcard falls from in between the pages

The image on the front is of a lonely coconut tree on a
beautiful deserted beach He checks the back there’s
nothing written on it except for Mark’s address

The printed description on the card says it’s from
Brazil Aaron is intrigued

EXT DIVING TANK - DAY

It’s the second round of the diving competition Herald
stands by the pool and watches as Aaron slowly climbs up
the stairs to the 10-meter platform

He cautiously approaches the edge of the platform He
looks down takes a deep breath

The CROWD watches him concentrated

Aaron raises his arms preparing to dive He looks down
and--

He can’t do it

He turns around rushes down the steps The CROWD bursts
into “OH’s” and surprised reactions

INT LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Aaron grabs his bag from the locker Herald walks in
Aaron SLAMS the locker door He gets dressed while they
talk

HERALD
Aaron--

AARON

I’ve never had to climb down those
steps Not even when I was a kid

HERALD

AARON
I have to be hard on myself I’m
an Olympic hopeful

HERALD
Youre an eighteen-year-old kid

AARON

HERALD

a while

AARON

HERALD

my life I used to hang out with
my friends all the time I had
fun

AARON

Aaron storms away leaving a hurt Herald behind

INT BLEACHERS - DIVING AREA - RIESLING GYM - DAY

Aaron sits and watches a group of SIX TEENAGE DIVERS
One by one they run and jump from the 3-meter
springboard like an assembly line

Herald approaches sits next to him watches the divers

AARON
I’m sorry about what I said

HERALD
Forget about it

AARON
No I know how important your job
here is How important you were
to my father

HERALD
Thank you

AARON

You know what was one of the last
things he said to me “You don’t
wanna end up like your old man”
(beat)

He was an Olympic diver he owned
one of the most prestigious gym in
town I mean what else did he
want

HERALD

He wanted you to be happy
Everything changes when you have
children You stop being the
priority in your own life

Aaron lets it sink for a while

AARON
I found a journal

Herald turns to him waiting for more

AARON
It’s a travel journal A trip my
father did with my mom at some
point He called it “The 4-Ocean
Journey” Did he ever mention it
to you

HERALD
(thinks)
No Not that I remember
He traveled a lot for the
competitions but that was about
it

Aaron can’t hide his disappointment

HERALD
I’m sorry son Your father could
be very secretive when he wanted

Aaron gazes at the young divers again They do push-ups
as a DEMANDING TRAINER pushes them to work harder

HERALD
I know I said this before but I
don’t think you should be alone in
that house If you don’t want to
come stay with me let me stay
with you for a week or two

AARON
Thanks I’m alright I’11 let you
know if I need anything I
promise

Herald raises his hand in surrender

AARON
(smiles)
You know what’s fucked up I
think you’re my best friend I
mean no offense butyou’re
old

HERALD
(chuckles)
Come on I’m sure you have plenty
of friends at school

AARON
I have classmates

HERALD
You’re going to college soon
you’re gonna make a bunch of
friends there

AARON
How am I supposed to keep a diving
scholarship if I can’t dive

HERALD
Youll be fine Just give
yourself some time

AARON
I don’t have time Trials are
around the corner

HERALD
You’re young You have all the
time in the world
(beat)
You have a great talent Aaron
Just don’t let it get in your way

INT LIVING ROOM - RIESLING’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Aaron grabs some of his father’s books from the shelves
places them inside boxes spread out on the floor

He comes across a magazine from the 90s On the second
cover he sees an ad with a picture of Mark standing on
the top of a platform holding a can of Pepsi It reads

“PEPSI THE CHAMPIONS APPROVE IT”

He puts the magazine in the box and gazes at the fire
place in front him the urn with Mark’s ashes sits
prominently over it next to a family portrait -- Mark and
Diana in their 30s with an 8-year-old Aaron

Aaron picks up the journal from the side table next to
him skims through it once again

MARK (VO)
There’s something mythical about
diving in the four oceans It
reminds me of why I wanted to dive
in the first place It gives me
plenitude I never thought I could
achieve

EXT BEACH - DAY

Aaron walks alongside the shore He stops to contemplate
the vast blue Pacific Ocean The water gently washes
his bare feet

INT DIVING AREA - RIESLING GYM - DAY

Aaron stands at the edge of the pool looking down at the
water DIVERS practice a few feet away

Herald walks in carrying a stack of clean towels and
grabbing used ones on the way As he notices Aaron he
puts everything down and approaches him

HERALD
How are you doing

AARON
How ironic is it that an Olympic
diver would diediving

A moment
HERALD
Have you ever heard of Fran
Crippen
Aaron shakes his head
HERALD

He was an Olympic swimmer
Healthy guy 26 years old One
day he was at a swimming
competition at the Persian Gulf
andhe drowned They say the
high temperature of the water led
him to exhaustion You’d think an
Olympic swimmer would know better
than to go over his limits right
(beat)
Not everything makes sense in this
world

AARON
I’m going away for a while And
Id like you to be in charge of
the gym I’m sure my dad would
like that

HERALD
Where is “away”

AARON
(hesitates)
“The 4-Ocean Journey”

Herald lets it sink in for a moment

AARON
He sounds sohappy in the
journal Like I’ve never seen him
in my life And so in love with
my mom like I’ve definitely never
seen

(beat)
(MORE)

AARON (CONTD)

He says this trip “reminded him of
why he loved diving” Maybe it
will have the same effect on me

HERALD

When are you planning to go

Friday

AARON

HERALD

(surprised)

AARON

Hey don’t laugh at my dreams
(beat)
I like helping people I have
always been fascinated by doctors
People who save lives They are
my idols I used to watch all the
medical shows on TV with my
parents
(MORE )

LUNA (CONTD)
They really wanted me to be a
doctor so it became sort of a
shared dream But medical schools
are so expensive -- and I’m not
that smart either -- so I got into
nursing school instead But I
love what I do so it’s all good

AARON
I’m sure your parents are proud of
you anyway

LUNA

Yeah well they are not really
around anymore SO

AARON
Oh I’m sorry What-- happened

They reach a corner She points at the distance

LUNA
Here we are

Aaron realizing she’ll not answer his question looks at
where she’s pointing--

It’s a big white round cathedral with a tower on each
side Some blue and gold details adorn the white front
It’s interesting-looking but not particularly pretty

MARK (VO)

The Cathedral has something magic
about it something peaceful I
don’t know exactly what it is but
I could stay here for hours in
silence just contemplating its

beauty

AARON
That’s it

LUNA
What’s wrong

AARON

My-- the guidebook makes it sound
muchprettier

LUNA
Doesn’t it have a picture

Can we eat in a church

One of the ladies SHUSHES them Luna giggles

LUNA
(whisper)
I mean eating is not a sin or
anything is it

Aaron also GIGGLES It ECHOES around the church It
makes it harder for them to control their LAUGHTER

OLIVIA
Shhh

Their LAUGHTER comes to a halt

LUNA
(whisper )
Why did you want to come to this
church anyway

AARON
(hesitates)
My father came here once

AARON

(hesitates)
I don’t know

EXT BEACH - ACAPULCO MX - NIGHT

Aaron cautiously approaches the water until it washes his
bare feet

He reaches inside his pocket and pulls out a tiny glass
bottle

He pulls out the cork lid and submerges the bottle in the
water filling it up He closes it holds it up
admiring it

MARK (VO)
The Pacific is warmer down here
I wish I could take some of that
warmth with me

He puts the bottle in his pocket and walks back to Luna
who sits on a picnic blanket next to a bonfire

LUNA
I bet your guidebook doesn’t have
this

Aaron sits down next to her Half-eaten fruits breads
and cheese are laid out next to empty glasses

AARON

It’s not a guidebook

My parents did this trip at some
point and my father wrote a
journal about it That’s my
“guidebook” I know it’s silly
but--

LUNA
It’s beautiful

A moment

AARON
He passed away last month

Luna stares at Aaron completely absorbed by him And in
one sudden movement she gives him a passionate kiss

AARON
(surprised)
What was that

LUNA
I believe they call it a kiss

On his silence she kisses him again gently pushing him
down She puts her hand underneath his shirt--

AARON
Wait

She stops

LUNA
What’s wrong

He looks around A few PEOPLE wander in the distance

AARON
It’s just-- There are people
looking

It’s small messy but it has a lot of character Aaron
follows her puts his small backpack down As she closes
the door she starts kissing him again

She unzips his pants He reflexively steps back She
finds it odd

AARON
(never mind)
I’m sorry
He goes back kissing her Now she’s the one who stops
LUNA
(amused)
Have you done this before

A moment

AARON
Of course

Luna smiles mischievously pushes him towards a futon
pulls his pants down Aaron has no choice but to lay
back and relax

FADE TO BLACK

MARK (VO)
There’s something about the
Pacific that excites me every
time I heard the Mexicans say it
has no memory

FADE IN

Aaron and Luna lie side by side a comforter barely
covering their naked bodies

Aaron caresses a TRIBAL TATTOO on her upper back

AARON
What does it mean your tattoo

LUNA
Look closer

She turns away so he can see better

LUNA
Can you read it

He looks closer gently touching it trying to make it
out

AARON
Juanand Carmen

She turns to him For the first time she looks fragile

AARON
Your parents

She nods

LUNA
It was a car accident
(off Aarons confused
look)
This morning you asked what
happened to my parents They died
in a car accident

AARON
I’m sorry

LUNA
They were coming back from a
wedding This drunk guy decided
he was too good to stop at a red
light

AARON
How long has it been

LUNA
Five years I was fifteen

AARON
You must have beendevastated

LUNA
I was supposed to go to that
wedding
(beat)

I told them there would only be
old people there that it would be
boring They said I should be
honored for being invited to
“celebrate their joy” and I said
I could “celebrate their joy” some
other time And that’s the last
thing I said to them

(beat)
So that’s what I’ve been trying to
do ever since “Celebrate the

joy” Celebrate my life without
wasting a minute

They lie silently for a moment until--

AARON
I wanna show you something

Aaron reaches for his backpack pulls out the journal
hands it to her

LUNA
Is it

Aaron nods She sits up and opens the journal carefully
She turns the pages contemplating Mark’s handwriting
He sits next to her

LUNA
So you’re trying to go to the
places he mentions here

AARON
The way he describes this trip
there’s just something about it
I thought maybeI don’t
knowit would make everything
okay again

She comes across the postcard with the image of the
lonely coconut tree gazes at it

AARON
He makes it sound like they were
so much in love I’ve never

seen them like this in real life
LUNA

Memories are not the same as real

life

AARON
What do you mean

LUNA
Well when we remember stuff
sometimes we romanticize it a
little bit We make it sound
better than it really was

AARON
You mean he’s lying

LUNA
Romanticizing is not lying

Aaron sits back lost in his thoughts She

kisses him

Young Mark laughing among them
Luna pulls him back to reality--

LUNA

mural covered with pictures

CUT TO

Aaron and Luna stand in front of the wall The pictures
on it show “famous clientele” mostly divers posing with
the same man Aaron scrutinizes it until something
catches his eyes--

A picture of Young Mark posing next to the man He
detaches it from the wall

AARON
That’s him That’s my dad

LUNA
Was he a diver

Aaron pulls an OLD WAITER who passes by points to the
man in the picture

AARON
(heavy accent)

Luna chuckles

OLD WAITER
Quieres hablar con el boss

LUNA

The waiter nods and disappears inside Aaron scrutinizes
every detail in the picture

AARON
Yes he was an Olympic diver

LUNA
No shit
Aaron checks the back of the picture The date scribbled
on it reads “1991” He smiles
AARON

‘91 So that’s when he did this
trip I wasn’t born yet

RICARDO a balding fat cheerful man comes from
inside He’s an older balder and fatter version of the
man in the pictures

Hola I heard an American wanted
to see me

AARON

Oh no no I can’t remember all
the days I wouldn’t have room
for anything else in my head

Ricardo checks the back of the picture sees the date

RICARDO
See Twenty years ago I still
had hair Did you know him

A moment Aaron looks at the picture one more time
before pinning it back to the wall disappointed

AARON
Not really

Luna notices the waiter approaching their table

LUNA
Our food is here

They walk back to the table Aaron stares at the plates
served breaded stuffed chicken and garlic fries plus
two beers

AARON
(bothered)
What is that

LUNA
Stuffed chicken It’s amazing

AARON
But that’s not what I wanted
(re beers)
And that’s not water

LUNA
(surprisedoffended)
I’m sorry Sir I just wanted you
to try something amazing If
that’s such a bad thing I’1l have
both beers and ask for your water
no problem

AARON
I-- It’s just that-- My whole life
people have been telling me what
to eat I can’t remember when was
the last time I ate what I wanted

There’s a moment of awkward silence before Aaron tries
the chicken His smile breaks the tension

shelves of books scattered around There are hundreds of
years of history embedded in each detail

I didn’t do much outside school
besidesdiving

LUNA
After my parents died I’d come
here every day It was the only
place I could get my mind off of
things So quiet

(MORE )

LUNA (CONTD)
I would dive into the books
hoping I’d be dragged into that
world I just wanted to escape
the real life

AARON
I know the feeling

LUNA
Let me show you something

She drags him through the aisles Aaron looks at the
books like a tourist in a museum They stop in front of
a set of shelves with a placard that reads--

“MIGUEL DE CERVANTES”

LUNA
See these books

She points to three shelves of books Aaron nods

LUNA
I read them all

Aaron stares at the books in awe

LUNA

The librarian had to kick me out

every night I didn’t want to go
home I just wanted to stay here
with Cervantes I was obsessed

Luna pulls out a book skims through it nostalgically
Aaron does the same

LUNA
He died the very same day as
Shakespeare Isn’t it crazy Two
of the brightest writers of all
time dying on the same day It
must have been a sad day

AARON
Why did you stop coming here

LUNA

(shrugs)
At some point I felt like I didn’t
need to anymore I don’t know
But I’d never have made through
the first months without

(taps the book)
-these

Aaron sits on an old bench flipping through the pages of
the book Luna watches him for a moment

LUNA
There’s a quote from Don Quijote
that I love

She sits next to him

LUNA
I know it in Spanish but it
translates to something like
“Too much sanity may become
madness and the maddest of all is
the one who sees life as it is
and not as it should be”

Aaron kisses her

LUNA
One last stop

Luna drags him towards the hallway that leads to the
restrooms

AARON
But that’s the restroom

(flirtatiously)
Exactly

They disappear into the ladies’ room

It takes a moment for Aaron to realize David is blind

DAVID
(jokingly)
You can’t see very well either

AARON
I hadn’t noticed I’m so sorry

DAVID
I don’t mind being blind I can
talk to people everywhere I go

to shut up right

AARON

DAVID
Also I can tell apart seventeen
different English accents I bet
you can’t do that

Aaron turns to see ZOE DORAN a woman whose tension
is apparent in every muscle and every breath striding in
their direction David doesn’t turn around

DAVID
And here she comes

ZOE
Come on don’t bother the
stranger

DAVID
He’s not a stranger Mom He’s
staying at our hotel

Aaron smiles

ZOE
Oh dear I’m sure he has other
plans already

AARON
(to David)
Maybe We’1l see

Aaron watches as Zoe leads David back As he turns back
to the sea he notices the water is already touching his
feet

He reaches inside his pocket and pulls out a tiny glass
bottle identical to the one he had in Mexico and fills
it up

EXT CLIFF TOP - GANTHEAUME POINT - BROOME AU - SUNSET

Aaron stands on the edge of a cliff on the corner of the
land All he sees ahead is the clear ocean

Young Mark in swimwear as if he were calling him

YOUNG MARK
Dont be afraid

He extends his hand towards Aaron

DIANA (0S)

Aaron looks to his right and sees--

Diana sitting down Thats whom Mark is extending his

Aaron does the same

YOUNG MARK
Close your eyes

Diana closes her eyes

YOUNG MARK
Breathe

Aaron takes a deep breath

Young Mark and Diana jump holding hands They hit the
water SPLASHING it everywhere

Aaron looks at the water hitting the rocks 15 feet below
him Mark and Diana have disappeared

His breath gets heavier and heavier until he finally
turns back and storms away

EXT BED and BREAKFAST RESTAURANT - BROOME AU - NIGHT
Aaron steps out to the restaurant area looking for an

empty table Lots of green adorn the area which is
mostly lit by fire pits and the moon

As he approaches an empty table he notices Zoe and David

have just started to eat at the table next to it He
considers for a moment before approaching David

AARON
Hello David

DAVID
Aaron You came Sit down

Aaron waits for Zoe’s invitation She nods politely
sits down

DAVID
You should try the shrimp It’s
really good

AARON
I’1l think about it

Aaron skims over the menu A WAITRESS approaches

AARON

Can I have the squid salad and

some water please
WAITRESS

I’m sorry we are out of squid

today
AARON

(disappointed)
Are you sure

The waitress nods “of course”

WAITRESS
Do you want a few more minutes

Aaron looks at David eating with gusto

AARON
I’1l just have what he’s having

The waitress writes it down and leaves An awkward
silence follows

He
ZOE
So how do you like Broome so far

AARON
It’s beautiful

DAVID
They say it’s the most beautiful
place in the world

ZOE
I believe kids can feel the beauty
of places like these even though
he can’t see

DAVID
I’m not a kid anymore Mom

ZOE
What is it that you do Aaron Do
you go to school

AARON
(hesitates)
I used to dive My dad was an
Olympic diver

DAVID
Wow That’s awesome How is it
to have a dad in the Olympics

AARON
It’s OK I’m sure your dad does
some cool stuff too

David is silent Zoe jumps in
ZOE
David’s father is not really part

of our lives anymore

AARON
Oh

DAVID
Can you teach me how to dive

ZOE
I don’t think that’s a good idea

DAVID
Oh come on Mom why do you--

ZOE
That’s not up for discussion
David it’s too dangerous for you

DAVID
Because I’m blind

ZOE
I’m sure Aaron agrees with me on
this one don’t you

Zoe throws Aaron a firm look

AARON
She’s right David Diving can be
pretty dangerous Even for
experienced divers

DAVID
This is bullshit

ZOE
David Language

Another uncomfortable silence Aaron notices Davids
disappointment and tries to cheer him up--

AARON
I’m going camel riding tomorrow
Maybe you could join me
(to Zoe)
Would that be OK

ZOE
That doesn’t sound much safer

DAVID
Oh come on Mom You think going
to a kids’ pool is dangerous

ZOE
People drown in those pools OK

EXT CABLE BEACH - BROOME AU - AFTERNOON
EIGHT CAMELS are lined along the shore A TOUR GUIDE
helps David climb on the camel on which Aaron sits Zoe

stands close to him

ZOE
Be careful honey

DAVID
(sarcastic)
Good idea Mom I hadn’t thought
about that

TOUR GUIDE
Don’t worry ma’am I’11 keep an
eye on him

Zoe waves him goodbye still worried

EXT CABLE BEACH - BROOME AU - SUNSET

The line of camels stride along the shore the sun going
down on the horizon behind them Aaron closes his eyes

Diana and Young Mark ride on the camel in front of him

MARK (VO)
Diana insisted we went camel
riding today I didn’t wanna tell
her that I was scared but once I
got there all my fear
disappeared It’s amazing how our
fears look insignificant once we
overcome them

Aaron breathes calmly enjoying every breath

MARK (VO)
Thank you Aaron

DAVID (0S)
Aaron

Aaron opens his eyes

AARON
Sorry what did you say

DAVID
I said thank you

AARON
For what

DAVID

For hanging out with me I’m sure
you have better things to do than
to hang out with a blind boy I
mean I would

AARON
Come on you’re cool
DAVID
I know but still

Aaron smiles

DAVID
Did you know some dogs can smell a
hundred billion scents Their
olfaction is amazing Just like
mine I mean I can’t smell a
billion scents but I can smell
more than other people

AARON
That’s fascinating

DAVID
When I heard that I decided I
wanted to be a veterinarian but
my mom is afraid I won’t make it
Shes afraid Ill be disappointed

AARON
Can I ask you something

DAVID
(jokingly)
You just did
AARON

Have you always been blind

DAVID
I was two when I went blind It
was an accident My mom tripped
on the stairs at our house and she
dropped me I hit my head

AARON
Holy sh--

DAVID
But she doesn’t know I know the
truth She says it was an
infection but my dad told me what
really happened

AARON
And why don’t you tell her you
know

DAVID
I don’t know I don’t want her to
feel guilty

They ride in silence for a moment

DAVID
I remember seeing this boat once
It was an old sailing boat with
big white sails When my dad was
around we used to live by the
beach so I probably saw one when
I was very little and the image
got stuck in my head

AARON
What happened to your dad

DAVID
Him and my mom fought a lot so he
left

AARON
Do you see him a lot
(realizing)
I mean--

DAVID
(chuckles)
No he doesn’t come visit anymore
I wish I knew more about him

They reach the end of the trail where some trees meet
the rocky end of the shore

TOUR GUIDE
Well stop here for a few minutes
for you guys to rest before we
head back

The guide helps David and Aaron climb off the camel
David takes a deep breath and listens to the SOUND of
the water hitting the rocks

DAVID
I know where we are There’s a
big tree over there isn’t there

David points to a beautiful big tree full of leaves

AARON
That’s right
DAVID
Come here I wanna show you

something

David grabs Aaron’s hand and drags him towards a small
trail right past the tree

AARON
Wait we can’t go too far We
have to stay close

DAVID
It’s right here God you sound
like my mother

EXT TRAIL - CABLE BEACH - BROOME AU - SUNSET

David and Aaron walk on a trail surrounded by small
bushes and trees

DAVID
This is my favorite place in
Broome so far

Aaron looks around There’s nothing particularly
impressive about it

AARON
(politely)
Nice

David yanks a leaf out one of a bush rubs it in his hand
and smells it He hands it to Aaron

DAVID
Here

Aaron smells it and opens up a huge smile David goes
on yanking leaves from other plants and smelling it
Aaron follows him doing the same entertained

DAVID
Aaron please take me diving

AARON
David your mom already said
you’re not allowed to Plus I
don’t dive anymore

DAVID
My mom doesn’t have to know
She’ll be at the spa tomorrow I’m
supposed to stay in the room
She’1ll never know I left

AARON
We can’t do that I’m sorry
DAVID
That’s bullshit I hate having

everyone telling me what I can and

can’t do

David tries to run back to the beach but he trips and

falls Aaron runs to help him up

AARON
You alright
DAVID
(angrily)
I’m fine

Aaron leads him back towards the beach

EXT PORT JETTY - BROOME AU - DAY

Aaron leads David through the pier that jettisons over

the clear blue-green ocean David is really excited

Aaron is really worried

AARON
This is a terrible idea

DAVID
Come on don’t be a puss

They stop at the edge of the pier David grabs a coin

from his pocket drops it on the water counting the

seconds before it HITS the surface
DAVID
This is about three meters high
isn’t it

AARON
That’s impressive

David takes his shirt off then his shoes

DAVID
I’1l go first

David runs and--

AARON
David wait

Too late David is already in the air jumping clumsily
from the pier YELLING IN EXCITEMENT Aaron watches him

plummet into the water

AARON
David

He waits for David to rise to the surface David rises
with the biggest grin on his face

DAVID
That was awesome

Aaron lets out a SIGH of relief

DAVID
Come on jump

Aaron stares at the water for a moment inert He
finally snaps out of it and climbs down the wooden steps
that lead to the water

AARON
I’m fine up here Come on

He extends his hand to David he grabs it They climb
back up to the pier

AARON
Let’s go now before your mom
gets back

DAVID

We still have time And you
agreed to take me cliff diving
This was just the appetizer

AARON
Didn’t you have enough fun

DAVID
Of course not

AARON
It’s too dangerous David

DAVID
But you’ll be there I trust you

Aaron gives in

EXT GANTHEAUME POINT - BROOME AU - DAY

Aaron cautiously leads David up the path of rocks that
leads to the cliff It’s a hard path for any man let
alone a blind one

AARON
Careful

David slips Aaron holds him before he falls completely
but not before David scratches his leg on a rock drawing
some blood

AARON
That’s it we’re going back down

DAVID
I’m fine We’re almost there
aren’t we It’s easier to just
jump than to climb back down

Aaron looks down at rocky path behind him -- David is
right

EXT CLIFF TOP - GANTHEAUME POINT - BROOME AU - DAY

Aaron -- once more -- stands on the top of the cliff his
father dove from this time holding David’s arm

AARON
Here we are

David contemplates the clear ocean in front of him as if
he could actually see it

Aaron watches as TWO YOUNG MEN standing a few feet from
them dive safely into the water below David listens to
them HITTING THE WATER

DAVID
(slightly frightened)
This is high

AARON
I told you

DAVID
So how do we do this You’re
jumping with me right

Aaron looks down at the water summoning up his courage

AARON

(sighs )
Alright here’s what we’re gonna
do I’m gonna hold your hand
You do not let go of it no matter
what understand You can hold
your nose with the other hand if
you want to

DAVID
OK

AARON
On three we take a deep breath
and jump As soon as we jump you
keep your legs straight close
together very firm And your
feet should be pointing down like
an arrow so it doesn’t hurt when
you hit the water

DAVID
Like this

David makes a point with his foot A little bit of blood
still drips from his shin

AARON
That’s right And as soon as you
hit the water you start swimming
back up again And again do not
let go of my hand

DAVID
OK I got it

AARON
Alright You ready

David nods excited

AARON
Give me your hand

They hold hands Aaron leads David to the very edge of
the cliff Aaron is tense

MARK (VO)
Close your eyes

Aaron closes his eyes David holds his nose

The thing I love the most about
diving is that it frees my mind
from absolutely everything else
(MORE )

MARK (VO) (CONTD)
For a few seconds I’m completely
focused on one thing and one
thing only hitting the water
perfectly

They hit the water with a BIG SPLASH
UNDERWATER

Aaron and David let all the air out bubbles surround
them They still hold hands Aaron pulls David up

OVER WATER

Their heads rise to the surface Aaron’s tension
dissipates David has an ear to ear grin

time to realize that

this dancer Luke Sweetest guy

funny

He said he had made me and that
he could destroy me So he
shattered my toes with a hammer

AARON

DEE

He went to jail thank God But
it took me five surgeries to walk
properly again

(beat)
He thought he could take the dance
away from me But you don’t dance

your heart

glass of caipirinha and watches COUPLES dance to FORRO
MUSIC an upbeat Brazilian rhythm he’s never heard
before

The dance floor is unpaved The moonlight cracks through
strategic openings in the ceiling

Aaron spots Roland very drunk talking cheerfully to a

WOMAN (30s) who looks like she doesn’t understand a word
he says but enjoys his company anyway

Roland raises his glass to Aaron and stumbles up to him
dragging the woman He hugs Aaron excitedly spilling

half of their drinks over him

him to the dance floor

She holds his left hand up and puts her left arm around
his waist

Forcing Aaron to do the same she gives two steps to the
right her hips following her legs She does the same to
her left

Aaron follows her lead clumsily at first but gets
progressively better eventually enjoying himself until
a commotion at the bar catches his attention

A FEW THUGS gang up on Roland who’s now even drunker
He seems to be trying to apologize for something in
vain

Aaron keeps dancing for a moment but as the guys get
more aggressive towards Roland he leaves the girl behind
and rushes towards them

AARON
Guys guys come on he’s drunk

A short thug pushes him away

SHORT THUG
Que que cé falou ai seu gringo de
merda

A fat thug pushes Roland to the ground As Aaron tries
to come to his aid the short thug swings his fist
towards Aaron’s face

of a painting A painting where
everyone is happy and carefree

A small frog jumps next to Aaron’s feet As Aaron walks

AARON

Roland hugs him again and walks out

Aaron throws himself at a hammock on the lobby facing
the floor He swings it lightly content relaxing
Suddenly something on the corner of the room draws his
attention--

A small cement tile with two pairs of handprints on it
He reads the words next to it--

“MARK and DIANA ‘93”

Aaron slowly walks up to it puts his hand over his dad’s
handprint and sees--

Young Mark kneeled down putting his hand over his
Diana kneels next to him making her mark as well

Aaron steps back Something is off He notices Dee
standing behind him observing

AARON
This doesn’t make sense My dad
was here with my mom in ‘91 not
‘93
Dee hesitates for a long time then--
DEE
That’s not your mom
(finally)
That’s me
Aaron stares at her completely shocked

AARON
What

Dee walks towards the cement tile and delicately places
her hand on the hand print It’s a perfect fit

DEE
I’m Diana

memories

BACK TO

DEE (VO)
-And he said “Wouldn’t it be
great to visit the four oceans one
day” And I said “Let’s do it”

AARON (VO)
And then you just jumped to the
next plane to Mexico

DEE (V0O)
I wish We started planning the
whole thing Choosing the cities
we would go to the places wed
visit There was no Internet here
back then so we had to draw from
books from memory Places wed
heard of places he’d been to and
wanted to go back to places he
could dive

BACK TO

INT AARON’S HOTEL ROOM - JERICOACOARA BR - NIGHT
Dee sits Aaron stands

DEE
We planned it all then he went
back to LA I went back to New
York and two days later he calls
me saying he wanted to see me
that he was flying in I got all
excited but when he got there

AARON
What What happened

DEE
He told me that Diana was
pregnant

AARON
(a moment)
With me

DEE
She got pregnant shortly before
they broke up

AARON
(outraged)
So he did cheat on my mom to go on
this trip with you

DEE
No Aaron you don’t understand
(long pause)
This trip never happened

Aaron is flabbergasted

DEE
When he found out your mom was
pregnant he went back to her
That’s what he went to New York to
tell me He did the right thing
(beat)
I never saw him again

AARON
(processing it)
But why-- when did he write that

DEE
I don’t know
AARON
But-- The-- No
Aaron tries to storm off
DEE

Aaron wait Your father did
nothing wrong

He turns back his head spinning

AARON
Oh he didn’t What about
spending his whole life wishing he
had married another woman
Writing a fucking novel about
another woman A woman he would
have traveled the world with if it
weren’t for the inconvenience of
having me

DEE
(kind)
You were not an inconvenience
AARON
(defiantly)
How would you know that
DEE
Because he told me so
AARON
(a moment)

No he didn’t

DEE
The postcard in the journal I
sent it to him when I bought this
place
(beat)
He wrote me back

AARON
What did he say

DEE
He said he was happy
AARON
Youre lying
DEE

I’m not lying Aaron

AARON
Let me see the letter then

DEE

(hesitates)

I’m not sure I still have it I’d
have to look for it

AARON
Youre a fucking liar My father
was never happy He spent his

entire life wishing I wasn’t born
so he could be with you It all
makes sense now

Aaron begins to throw his belongings into his backpack

DEE
You don’t know what you’re talking
about

AARON

I know exactly what I’m talking
about I never stood a chance
Not even all gold medals in the
world would make me as perfect as
you in that journal

Dee is silent

AARON
And how can you be so cool with
all that The man dumps you for
his ex and you buy the place
where you had a romantic week
Are you some kind of masochist

DEE
No I moved on And so did your
father What we had was magical
while it lasted but that was it
Love is not just about romantic
trips It’s about tolerating
habits that annoy the shit out of
each other it’s about waking up
at 4 AM to change diapers after
an exhausting day

(beat)

And I’m sure your father found all
that just like I did

AARON
You don’t know anything
(beat)
Please get out

Dee hesitates then leaves

Did you know about this

AARON
The woman my father would have
married if I hadn’t been born

HERALD
What happened son

AARON
That journal was about another
woman Another Diana He gave up
on the love of his life because of
me

(MORE )
AARON (CONTD)
Settled for someone else and
became this sad man who couldn’t
see joy if it were yelling at his
face

A long pause

AARON
I know you’re gonna say “Shut up
Aaron I’m sure your father loved
you you’ve got it all wrong--”

HERALD

No

(beat)
I have no doubt whatsoever that
your father loved you with all his
heart butit is possible that
he only got married because your
mother was pregnant that he was
in love with someone else his
whole life

AARON
(a moment and then )
You knew about her

Herald is silent Aaron gets worked up

AARON
You knew about her all this time
and didn’t say anything

Herald remains completely calm

HERALD
Have you met my son

AARON
Ch (where’s this going)
What

Herald pulls out his wallet

HERALD
This is my son

Herald shows him a picture of an 8-year-old white
blonde blue-eyed boy

HERALD
Youve seen my wife so you know
he can’t possibly be our natural
son

Aaron glances at the picture

HERALD
My wife can’t have children It
has always been our biggest dream
we tried everything but it just
wasn’t possible So we adopted

Ricky

AARON
What does it have to do with
anything

HERALD

Do I wish we could have children
Yes Would I have adopted Ricky
if I had my own children No
Can I imagine my life without him
now Hell no

(beat)
Maybe things didn’t turn out quite
as your father expected but it
rarely does To anyone If he
became a sad man who couldn’t see
joy in anything as you say that
was his choice

(beat)
And it’s your choice whether or
not you do the same

He gazes at it for a moment then pulls out the rest of
the content--

An old smaller envelope A post-it on it reads
“IT TOLD YOU I WASN’T LYING XOXO DEE”

He inspects the old envelope It’s addressed to Dee in
Brazil and it has a postmark from 1996

Aaron and Julia walk on the completely deserted beach
Though it’s night the sun is still up

AARON (VO)
I like to think of it asa
shared dream

They stand by the shore the cold water wash their boots
He pulls out one little bottle from his pocket and fills
it up with water from the ocean

INT HOSPITAL - ACAPULCO MX - DAY

Luna laughs hysterically as she helps a smiley OLD LADY with her clothes at a hospital bed

AARON (VO)
--A dream which you Dad Mom
and everyone on the way was a part
of

INT POUSADA DO ENCANTO - JERICOACOARA BR - DAY

Dee reads the letter teared up She reaches for the box
and pulls out Mark’s journal

AARON (VO)
--Please accept the enclosed as a
gift from me and from my Dad who
I’m sure would’ve loved you to
have it

As she opens the journal she sees enclosed a picture of
the four tiny bottles Aaron filled during the trip now
labeled ATLANTIC PACIFIC INDIAN ARCTIC

She can’t hold her tears any longer

EXT UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO - DAY

Aaron stands in the middle of the campus backpack on his
back contemplating the new world around him

AARON (VO)
As for myself I’m starting
UCSD in the Fall Undecided I
heard San Diego is a great place
to live youd probably like it

INT DIVING AREA - RIESLING GYM - DAY

Herald shows the gym to NEW MEMBERS A YOUNG DIVER dives
from the 3-meter springboard

AARON (VO)
1 still dive sometimes but

only when I feel like it I just
figured it’s high time I followed
my own path whatever it may be

EXT BOAT - ARCTIC OCEAN ALASKA - DAY

Aaron stands at the top of a small anchored boat He
looks at the icebergs in the distance then at the water
a few feet below him

AARON (VO)
It was a tough decision but I
find that the right decision is
usually the hardest one to make

He takes his shirt off turns backwards and with the
biggest smile lets his body fall loosely into the water

FADE TO BLACK

AARON (VO)
Love Aaron
