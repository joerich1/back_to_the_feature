1 STOCK SHOT - NORTH POLE AREA - DAY

With possibly radically-designed jet planes flying
over the Arctic wastes

NARRATOR
It cost Commander Robert Peary
twenty years or unremitting hard-
ship and misery to reach the North
Pole finally in 1909

DISSOLVE TO
ANOTHER STOCK SHOT - ARCTIC WASTES - DAY

NARRATOR
It would have astounded Peary to
learn that by the late 1950s
and early 60s the vast frozen
top-of-the-world he pioneered had
become a vital highway for world
travel and commerce Not just in
the skies

SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - UNDER ICE - SUBMARINE ROUTE

NARRATOR
-but also deep under the ice
in the frigid five-million-square-
mile depths of the Arctic Ocean

SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CARGO SUB STURGEON - DAY

The huge heavy vessel glides smoothly along between
underwater mountains following the well-beaten Polar
route

NARRATOR
Here great passenger and cargo-
carrying atomic submarines glided
by the dozens back and forth
across the Pole until a series
of mysterious undersea disasters
threatened to close the Arctic
route forever

SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CLOSE SHOT - STURGEON

As it glides very close PAST CAMERA so we can read
the name USAS STURGEON (United States Atom Sub

Sturgeon) on the bow We may spot the closed-circuit
TV camera on the surface of the conning tower

NARRATOR

The decisive moment came May 3 at
1315 hours when the undersea
atomic liner Sturgeon largest of
them all reached 87 degrees 10
minutes north latitude - only a
few miles from the North Pole it-
self

SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - UNDERWATER ICE CAVE - DAY

In the depths of it appears a distant faint ball of
glowing light The ball begins moving toward CAMERA
slowly becoming larger and larger There may be a
FAINT WEIRD ELECTRICAL HUM just audible from it

SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CARGO SUB STURGEON

It moves ahead unconscious of impending doom the Peep-
Peep of its sonar impulses now gradually increasing in
pitch Doppler effect as they echo back from the
approaching blob of light

SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER - DAY

Dimly seen a vague indistinct shape (thru this sequence
-- it approaches -- a huge oval-shaped disc with what
seems to be a revolving turret or lighthouse on top
The Peep-Peep of the Sturgeon sonar has now risen to a
frantic scream and the MAGNETIC LOW-FREQUENCY HUM from
the saucer becomes louder and louder

SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - PAN SHOT WITH STURGEON

The great atom sub glides past camera but now as we
are shooting from her stern over the bow we see the
screws halt then go into reverse and she begins to
back away back TOWARD CAMERA Then in the bg we
see the saucer the great eerie eye or whatever it
is looming like a searchlight on her top and the
oval shape seeming like a great mass of glowing energy
The saucer is easily overtaking the reversed Sturgeon
when

SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER
It moves to a position nearly filling screen when

A great bolt of sheer high-frequency energy - like an

undersea lightning bolt - stabs out from somewhere in
the saucer and lances out TOWARD CAMERA

SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER AND STURGEON

The great stabbing bolt of energy impinges on the hull
of the Sturgeon and for an instant the entire sub
seems to glow with radiant light Then in closer de-
tails we see the effects

SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - BOW OF STURGEON

It seems to melt away (or collapse) like a shell of
paraffin over a fire The water boils and hisses
about it

SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - CONNING TOWER

The radio antenna the periscope the mast the tower
itself - all seem to melt and collapse

SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE STURGEON

What is left of the Sturgeon glowing and hissing
still red hot begins rising to the surface towards
the ice-layer

SPECIAL EFFECT SHOT - THE SAUCER

It reverses draws back into the ice-cave from which
it issued

SPECLAL EFFECT SHOT - ABOVE ICE - DAY

And now she seems to be rising in a tremendous crunch-
ing grinding writhing activity Finally it breaks
completely and for a moment the red-hot hull of the
Sturgeon is visible in the cracking grinding masses

of ice Then a larger hiss of steam and finally a
ROAR of earthquake volume a fireball then a mushroom
cloud The atomic reactor of the Sturgeon has blown up
the ship is vaporized to nothingness As the atomic
cloud rises up toward camera

INT WAR ROOM - DAY - MATTE SHOT - EST SHOT

This room is more than anything else a system of maps
and charts - a huge detail of the Arctic ocean occupy-
ing an entire wall behind the conference table On it
are small magnetic models of submarines defense
stations etc Also to one side is a huge globe of
the world on a revolving stand File cabinets rolled

can burst in on the excuse of making a mistake

CLOSE SHOT - ADMIRAL TERHUNE

The burly grim-faced Admiral in uniform is at the
head of the conference table There is an intercom
on a small stand beside his position at the table The
Admiral has a sheaf of reports and photographs also
a stack of mimeographed briefs at his elbow No
nonsense Terhune speaks in clipped brief phrases
almost as if he has digested sentences down to short
terse bursts before releasing them from his lips
The Admiralts lips are moving as we first see him
but we do not hear his speech until the Narrator is
finished

NARRATOR
Admiral Terhune in charge of the
Arctic Theater for the Joint Chiefs
well knew the effect the leak of
any of the explosive information
would have on the world civilian
population So the Admiral was
determined There would be no

trigger-tempered is reluctantly taking leave from
Reefs party His pretty placid wife HELEN is

his farewell scene short Dave is slightly but
not objectionably high REEF HOLLOWAY a handsome
capable relaxed Annapolis-type is smiling amiably
and bantering with Dave all the while trying to
usher him out with determined speed But it is not
easy to get Dave through the door He is chattering
constantly in a lecturing tone to someone inside

portion of the doorway

REEF

Now Dave Old Buddy you know
youre exaggerating -

(to Helen)
What do you think of this husband
of yours On most boats a certain
loyalty exists between the Exec and
his Navigation and Firing Officer

(he sighs tragically)
But unfortunately in the case of
Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger
Shark and myself -

DAVE
(fighting his way back
inside militantly)
But Julies a nice girl and Ive
seen you work She deserves a fighting
chance

shoulders and staring him in
the eye)

of your three children Now please
take me home to them At once

Dave smiles weakly now feeling the drinks bows
heroically to the room at large and exits scene
under Helens guiding arm Reef closes the door
behind them with an elaborate sigh then CAMERA
PANS WITH HIM into scene with Julie She looks up
at him impishly and smiles

JULIE
Dave is exaggerating Just think a
man spends three months in a deep freeze
Itd take his whole shore leave just to
thaw him out By that time hes ready

In a deep torried kiss on the couch Eyes closed

they enthusiastically plumb the depths of feeling then
at last reluctantly they break apart Julie sighs
deeply Reef shakes his head like a boxer who has
sustained a knockout punch trying to clear it CAMERA
PULLS BACK for MED TWO Julie unable to speak for a
moment throws a quick look at Reef who seems to be
gulping for air then she reaches for a cigarette from
a box on the coffee table She drops two or three as
she fumbles for one and finally gets it in her mouth

Reef picks up a table lighter strikes it holds it to
her cigarette But his arm is trembling so he cannot
hold it steady Finally Julie grasps his wrist holds
the flame steady then contrives to bring the tip of the
cigarette in contact with it She leans back takes a
deep drag only now dares to speak

JULIE
(ruefully)
What was I sayingabout thawing
out icebergs

Reef manages a tiny smile Then he observes
REEF
You never can tell about ice-
bergs Only one-ninth above water

Julie weighs this then studies Reef appraisingly
JULIE
After that kiss - Id say thats
about right

Reef snuggles closer to her slips an arm about her
waist murmurs

Suppose theres an atmosphere

What

REEF
(to the group)
If we could get inside the saucer
- use our torches - maybe we could
cut the Shark loose

Thats all very fine young man
But how would one go about get-
ting inside Cyclops

Reef takes a deep breath throws a glance at Carl then
says

REEF
Through the eye - with the

Carl seizes this eagerly
CARL

Yes - the Explorer was built to
operate at even greater depths --

WENDOVER

But suppose there isnt an atmos-
phere inside the saucer

(SPECIAL EFFECTS)

The black catfish-or-sea urchin-like spines seem

to rise from limp supineness They stiffen grope
like fingers move towards a series of grommet-like
openings in the translucent wall of the sphere Now
a spine nears a grommet slips into it apparently
making contact for somewhere a FAINT LIGHT comes
on and the scene becomes lighter In a moment
another spine slips into another grommet-hole

291 EST SHOT ON FLOOR (PLATFORM) - CAVERNOUS INTERIOR -
BACK AT TINY MEN ON PLATFORM - MATTE SHOT

We see a long slender bridge or catwalk extending
out into space apparently reaching toward a great
opalescent sphere that seems to hang suspended on
cushioning points some sort of shock-absorbing system
in the very center of the saucer A weird GLOW seem-
ing to become ever brighter emanates from inside this
sphere

292 TWO SHOT - DAVE AND REEF

Awed round-eyed silent they stare open-mouthed at
the sight But before they can make any comment

But Reef is too intent on the voice Now he begins dis-
arming as Dave looks incredulous

DAVE

But as it moves to center frame in from the opposite
corner comes the ICBM heading straight and true for the
