BANK ROBBER 2
(in German)
There’s no money in the vault
Just these notes

BANK ROBBER 1
Barry there was supposed to be
two million in cash What the shit
is going on

BARRY

(fast nervous

description)
Well see the Fed just came and
seized all our cash and reserve
deposits Right before that
happened the bank put all of its
outstanding mortgages into four
tranches which was snapped up by
China which is a good thing
Cash infusion right Wrong
sixty percent of debt was toxic
Cash from China isn’t coming in
and now we’ve had to issue
Promissory Notes to cover all
reserves on deposit But I assure
you in four years you’re looking
at six hundred thousand dollars a
nice tidy sum

Bank Robber 3 holds up a bag

BANK ROBBER 3
I got eight thousand from the
drawers Let’s go

All three Bank Robbers start to back out of the bank
Barry follows

BANK ROBBER 1
(turns and points
gun)
And Barry just to guarantee that
no one talks

BARRY
I asked you a dozen times if you
were going to kill me after the
robbery and you said no

BANK ROBBER 1
I lied

BARRY
I even asked you if you would say
“I lied” if I asked you why you
were going to kill me after-

gallon

TERRY
Five but there’s more to a car
than that

He revs and the 8 cylinders light up like a stallion

ALLEN
That means nothing Definitions of
power are changing every day Who
would win in a fight Noble Prize
winning economist Paul Krugman or
ultimate fighter Ken Shamrock

TERRY
Ken Shamrock

ALLEN
Really But then Paul Krugman
manipulates currency rates
devaluing Ken Shamrocks earning
power leading to unemployment and
less time working out

TERRY
And Ken Shamrock walks in and
punches Krugman in the face

ALLEN
Don’t get me wrong I love Ken
Shamrock I’m a huge fan But in
the long run Krugman comes out
ahead

TERRY
But in the short run Shamrock arm
bars Krugman

ALLEN
I could not be a bigger Ken
Shamrock fan But Shamrock has
gimpy knees and is broke by the
time he’s forty having in no way
affected the world Meanwhile
Krugman Just started collecting

awards

TERRY
You asked who would win and I told
you

TIM
Hey guys nice party

It’s Tim from the Apple store

TIM (CONTD)
So I hooked up my Mosaic software
to my Macbook pro and pumped that
through my X-Box 360 No one will
ever tell you this then ran it
through Ershon’s company’s hard
driveunnoticed And got the
last million keystrokes Back
tracked it and I found some
dripping wet juicy stuff Turns
out his foreign banking clients
bought about 90 billion from him
in CDSRs Credit default swap
reverses

TERRY
What’s that Smack

TIM
No How did you get that from what
I just said Anyway Ershon sold
several foreign banks Credit
Default Swaps which are basically
insurance that the reserves won’t
fail except you can sell and buy
them But he then adds a reverse
which allows him to invest the
default swaps with other banks He
created his own financial product
Made billions off of this

ALLEN
That’s fantastic work Tim

TIM
So any word on re-hiring Things
are pretty bad

(MORE )

TIM (CONTD)
I’m working on the Geek Squad

is the Saint Marjora Gruyere made
by blind celibate monks in the
Basque region Aged ten years in
the tomb of Saint Ferdinand They
say every slice of cheese has ten
tears the monks shed for the
flowers they will never see This
single piece of cheese cost more

mortgages that money was turned
around and invested in a film
production company which at some

left
