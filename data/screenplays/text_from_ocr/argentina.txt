26 INT - OFFICE FEDERAL COURT - DAY 26
Superimposed FEDERAL COURT

The light blue folder with the ruling of the Military Court is on
the table Judge SOLANET -40 years old with a long carefully
groomed mustache- is reading it The atmosphere is tense

SOLANET

(Reading Serious)
This Council informs
that according to its
investigation the decrees
directives orders and
military procedures to
combat the stateless subversion
were in both their content and
form unobjectionable

ASAD -big man dark hair combed-back- interrupts His voice
carries authority and calmness You can sense a kind of
complicity with SOLANET

ASAD
Unobjectionable

SOLANET
Just like that

TROTTA thin and elegant rushes him

TROTTA
Keep reading

SOLANET
The excesses were
committed by
the subordinatesand
the court should
investigate the
wrongdoings of the
alleged victims in order
to pass sentence

LOSADA and DAMICO are listening
DAMICO

The wrongdoings of the victims
Remarkable
SOLANET
Enough right

They all look at each other Theyre afraid

Shall we vote Do we need
to vote

Nobody answers We can see they are tense VERGARA bald with
a hard face doesnt seem convinced

VERGARA
I wouldnt take it so lightly

ASAD
What do you mean lightly

VERGARA
I mean we have to be cold think
about the risks and whether we can
guarantee that this trial will
follow procedure

ASAD
Why wouldnt it follow
procedure

VERGARA
There’s enormous pressure

SOLANET
What do you suggest

SOLANET takes the military sentence in his hands again

SOLANET
Im sorry but does anyone
really think we can leave it
like this They are blaming the
victims

VERGARA
No no one does

ASAD
So what are we waiting for
gentlemen

VERGARA
They look at each other

We must act but not blindly

ASAD
(Raises his tone again)
If we dont act blindly and
that means now this trial will
not take place
(Pause)
We will give the military what
they didnt give to their
victims a fair trial OK

They look happy despite the tension

TROTTA
And the evidence

DAMICO
The evidence are the prosecutors job

SOLANET
And if they cant find any

TROTTA
If they cant find any we will
have to absolve

DAMICO
Shall we notify the prosecutor

ASAD gets up and walks towards a typing machine

motherfuckers —

JULIO is about to light a cigarette but RUSO makes a
sign for him to stop JULIO stands up

RUSO
But you know what Sometimes
something
goes wrong and theres a gap a

minimum one Something that nobody
sees A crack

(He separates his fingers
slightly)

It doesnt last for long it shuts
right away But as long as the
crack is open you can do
something One must hurry

be alert But if you manage to do
it before these motherfuckers
notice it you can change things a
bit You can do something

good Very good Good things were
done like that all of the sudden
And they were done by the few
people who realized this The brave
ones Thats how they made

Silence

JULIO
Go on They made what

RUSO
Nothing nevermind
JULIO
History Was that what you were going

to say

Hmm Telechea

36 INT - COURTROOM PALACE OF JUSTICE - DAY 36
SUPERIMPOSE October 3rd 1985

SUPERIMPOSE Preliminary Hearings

Except for a few janitors and court clerks the courtroom is still
empty

Theres a young man with a beard seemingly shy standing next to
the desk reserved for the prosecutor LUIS From his perspective
we can see JULIO coming in from the main corridor When he gets
closer he looks at him

LUIS tries to approach him when from the other side of the hall
an older man in a nice suit approaches Its the defense attorney
BASILE

BASILE
Crazy StrasseraProsecutor of the
Republic

JULIO

How are you Basile

BASILE
Here we are Making a living like
everyone else Like you I guess

JULIO
Yeah But there are ways and ways of
making a living Basile

The rest of the defense attorneys enter the room while this
discussion takes place
w
a

BASILE
If youre talking about my
client you know I was assigned
by the Court Im a public
defendor

JULIO
I dont see that bothering you
One would say you hit the
jackpot

BASILE
If you are asking me if it
bothers me it doesnt Not at
all What is honestly shocking
Crazy is that you have suddenly
become the defender of
the guerillas

JULIO

Im a prosecutor I
dont defend anyone I
prosecute criminals

BASILE
You mean accusing those who defended
motherland from the guerilla Uh-huh

A voice interrupts them Its LOZA the Secretary of the court

LOZA
All rise gentlemen

The Judges walk in ASAD TROTTA VERGARA SOLANET
LOSADA D’AMICO

LOZA
(continues)
I hereby declare the preliminary
hearings of Case 1384 open

While the judge speaks JULIO looks at LUIS Trying not to be
too loud he asks

JULIO
Excuse me what are you doing here

The first time LUIS speaks its clear that he has a very strong
accent distinctive of the upper classes of Buenos Aires He also
has a light stutter

LUIS
I-I-I am losmonocampo
M-my name is losmonocampo

JULIO
Los monocampos

LUIS
(Tries to speak slowly)
Ww
i)

L-Luis Moreno Ocampo
In that moment another judge announces

TROTTA
Bring the defendants in

Meanwhile on the other side LUIS goes on

LUIS
Im here at your service Sir

JULIO
(To Luis whispering )
I dont know what theyve told
you but we are not looking for
auxiliary staff

LUIS
I was appointed deputy prosecutor

JULIO
Huh

LUIS
Im your deputy prosecutor Sir

Then the nine defendants have just walked into the courtroom
VIDELA MASSERA AGOSTI VIOLA GALTIERI LAMBRUSCHINI and the
other three COMMANDERS JULIO and LUIS remain silent On the
other side of the hall crowded behind a desk are BASILE
GONZAGA LAGOS and a dozen other defense attorneys

CUT TO

VIDELA and his attorney BASILE are the first ones to make a
statement

TROTTA
Please state your name

VIDELA
Jorge Rafael Videla And let me add
Lieutenant General of the Argentine
Army

VIDELA looks at him defiantly JULIO looks at LUIS He is
open-mouthed BASILE speaks into the microphone

BASILE
Your Honor my defendant requests
to read a statement

VIDELA

(reading)
Your Honors I dont recognize the
legitimacy of this court
JULIO listens quiet

ASAD is eloquent in its argument
maintains his challenging attitude

BASILE
The defense reaffirms that
the alleged crimes he is being
accused of correspond to the
military sphere and should
therefore be judged by a
Military Court

ASAD
The military court had
its chance and you know

perfectly well that it is within

the authority of his court to

investigate and try the crimes

your defendant is accused of

-even if he doesnt consider it

so Are we clear

37 INT EXT - PALACE OF JUSTICE - DAY 37

JULIO exits the Palace
and ROMERO and now LUIS as well

JULIO stops abruptly

SOMI
So

JULIO
Videla is much shorter
than I expected

SOMI

BASILE keeps quiet
rejecting the court

VIDELA

followed by his small entourage HORMIGA
SOMI arrives in a hurry

Sure the hat and the boots must add

a few extra inches

SOMI notices LUIS walking behind them

SOMI
Who is this

JULIO

SOMI

He looks at LUIS

JULIO

Tell me Luis Maria Campos
How are you supposed to help
us How many trials have you
taken part in

LUIS

Moreno Ocampo None

The help we were so anxious to get

He doesnt look like a bodyguard

w
Ww
rs

JULIO
How many prosecutions

LUIS
None

JULIO
So what do you do You must do
something

LUIS

I work for the Prosecution I ama
professor at University

JULIO
I know You make a living out of that
Molina Campos

LUIS
Sort of

SOMI
Your mom helps you out

LUIS
My mom Actually if theres one thing Mom
doesnt like is the fact that I am
about to take part in this trial

JULIO
Why do you do it then

SOMI
(Ironic)
Maybe its precisely because of that

LUIS
Do you want to know why they
thought of me I come froma
military family My uncle is an
Army Colonel

JULIO
That doesnt make you look goood

LUIS
My mother goes to mass every
Sunday at the same church as
Videla And for her Videla is
good man who did the
right thingand the
disappeared surely they did
something

JULIO and SOMI listen he got their attention

SOMI
I dont understand

JULIO
I think Im gonna go

They go outside LUIS catches up with them He speaks with more
confidence

LUIS
Sorry Sir I think I wasnt very
clear

JULIO

Yes You werent at all

LUIS
Think about it this way
this is a government that has
just taken office a weak government
with the military breathing down its
neck right

JULIO
Right

LUIS

And theyve made the dangerous yet
right decision to bring them to
trial So I think its a good idea
to bring in young lawyers from
wealthy families instead of human

rights lawyers who could easily be
discredited as communists not
only by the Military but also by
the middle class theyre the ones
that have to be convinced for this
trial to have the legitimacy it
needs

JULIO looks at him

LUIS
(Finishes his argument)
Considering the middle class
traditional tendency to justify
any military coup

Silence SOMI bursts into laughter He applauds
SOMI
(To Julio)
That wasnt bad at all what he said

LUIS doesn’t answer SOMI and LUIS follow JULIO

38 INT - BAR - DAY 38

w

a
JULIO LUIS and SOMI are eating on the counter of a downtown bar

JULIO
We are 3 people we have 5 months
to submit the irrefutable
evidence against 9 commanders of
homicides kidnapping torture and
grand theft

LUIS
Well yeswe need to put together
a team right away

JULIO
Exactly Molina Campos

LUIS
(Corrects him)
Moreno
JULIO

And we know we cant trust the
policeand that 90 percent of
the judiciary staff doesnt want
to get involved at all in this

trial
SOMI
99
LUIS
I think we have to look elsewhere
then
JULIO

Where Law School

LUIS
Not exactly But kind of
(SOMI and JULIO look at him)
At the Attorney Generals Office
for instance there are lots of kids
who would be willing

JULIO
Kids

LUIS
Yes and in every court too

JULIO stays thoughtful something about that idea starts to make
sense

LUIS
We have to bring people from other
places Young people with less

experience

JULIO

Ww
Less experience than you

LUIS
Yes if we must If the senior staff
wont do it

JULIO
(finishing his sentence)
Well bring the juniors in
(He looks at Luis)
Very well Moreno Ocampo

Finally JULIO gets his name right

holding a shoebox containing piles of cards

LUIS
The responsibility under the
chain of command lies with the
juntas they were in charge that
part is clearBut its also the
hardest one to prove

MACO
How is it difficult If the
torture the killings the
kidnappings and every crime has
already been proved or they can
be proved

LUIS
But how do you prove they knew
about it

MACO
How wouldnt they

LUIS
They can just say “I knew nothing
These were mistakes and excessive
actions committed by subordinates I
cant be watching what every
subordinate does It was a war”
a
fo)

MACO
Thirty thousand mistakes

MARIA EUGENIA
Hes right They can say “I

didnt
kill anybody I didnt torture
anybody I didnt order anyone

to be disappeared I dont even
know how to operate an electric
prod

JUDITH
Someone must have seen them A
whistleblower I dont know

LUIS

(Emphatic)
We have to focus on the plan
We need to prove that they did the
same thing everywhere They abducted
people from their homes everywhere
they locked them up in clandestine
centers everywhere they used torture
in interrogations everywhere they
made people disappear across the
country

JULIO
There were no mistakes the
subordinates did what they were
supposed to do There were no
excessive actions the military
juntas ordered them to do precisely
that Making people disappear If we
prove this we prove that there was
a coordination between the branches
across the country and that there
is no way the Juntas were not aware
of it They are ultimately
responsible

So we pick the cases We organize

HEAR THE TICKING OF THE WATCH The former minister ITALO LUDER
first witness walks into the courtroom He takes his oath

ASAD asks him a question LUIS and JULIO look at both sides
Someone in the AUDIENCE stands up LUIS now focuses on the large
clock on the wall above the main entrance LUIS thinks he spots
the SUSPICIOUS MAN in the audience He tries to tell JULIO but
he is posing his first question LUIS looks at the wristwatch
then at the audience again The SUSPICIOUS MAN is gone LUIS
scans the courtroom with his eyes A door closes and the banging
sound resonates in the courtroom LUIS is startled He keeps
looking He spots the SECURITY GUARD who is leaning against a
wall and then walks towards the exits The second hand on the
wall clock is moving The one on his wrist watch too LUDER

Back inside someone places heavy files on a table causing
another bang that resembles an explosion and LUIS is startled
again With the bang the ambient sound comes back We leave the
feeling of an imminent catastrophe behind A hand takes the
suspicious briefcase and leaves There was no bomb in it BASILE
asks a question

BASILE
the atmosphere of instability and
violence in the country is what lead
you to sign that decree

LUDER
Yes police forces were unable to
contain the subversive violence

BASILE
And you believed the Army would be able
to do it

LUDER

Well I thought it would help

BASILE
Help in what way By annihilating the
subversive groups that were terrorizing
the country right

LUDER
Like I said the situation was out of
control

BASILE picks up the papers with the decree and speaks to the
judges

BASILE
So we should stress that the order of
annihilation was decreed during the
government of Maria Estela Martinez de
Perén requesting the help of the
Armed Forces because we were on the
verge of a civil war Isnt that
right Dr
LUKAS
I never said anything about a civil
war

BASILE

How would you define it then

LUDER
I never said war

BASILE
But its clear that there was an enemy
compromising national security

LUDER is speechless JULIO charges immediately

JULIO
Let the witness say what is his sense
of this word the defense deems so
important What does the witness
understand by annihilate

ASAD

Please clarify the question Mr Prosecutor

JULIO

(Emphatic)
May the witness clarify if
for him annihilating means to obtain
information at any cost torturing
with an electric prod kidnapping and
physically eliminating a helpless
individual

ASAD
You may answer

LUDER
In no way it means a physical
annihilation nor a violation of the
legal system that ruled the country
The decrees in no way imply
repression outside the law

LUDER breathes with relief BASILE and JULIO exchange looks

PABLO DIAZ

One day I asked if I could talk to
her to one of the guards who was all
things considered quite humanitarian
He takes me to Claudias cell I lift
my blindfold Claudia says

Pablo thank you for the strength you
give me I had told her that when we
get out we would start a
relationship she and I like dating
I wouldnt know how to call it Then
at a certain point she tells me
‘dont touch me because Ive been
raped They raped me when they were
torturing me they flipped me over and
raped me from the front from the
back

()

The night before they released me
Claudia said one thing I will never
forget that on every December

31st New Years Eve I should raise
my glass for her and for everyone
because she was already dead

idea to torture this prisoner And
they started torturing him again This
time they didnt want any information
Your Honor They were having fun
shouting It was an orgy And the only
thing they wanted my apologies Your

Honor they were torturing him

to have him say that And he didnt

say it

convincing)

what they did to you Its your chance

to let the country hear about these
criminals who have done you wrong

JUDITH
He called minutes before noon and said
to be a member of the Comando
Tricolor

BASILE
Theres no such Comando Could you
say something more specific A name
Any traits

JUDITH
Of course since this was an anonymous

threatening phone call I cant provide any

JUDITH
It was a strange raspy sort of ridicule
voice

JUDITH looks to the sides JULIO makes a gesture encouraging her

JUDITH

ADRIANA

On April the 15I went into labor As

going to be quick

A patrol came they put me inside and
we left the 5th precinct

(-)
I was lying down in the car
blindfolded and with my hands tied
behind my back They insulted me I
told them my child was coming that I
couldnt hold it any longer I told
them to stop that it wasnt my
firstborn and I knew it was time They
didnt do anything the driver and the
one next to him kept laughing They
told me it made no difference they
were going to kill me anyways and my
child too what did I care Finally I
dont even know how I managed to take
off my underwear I really dont
remember how I screamed Its
coming I cant wait anymore
And indeed my baby girl was born
she was born I was shouting them to
stop the car They finally stop on the
verge of the road My baby was
healthy she was very small She was
hanging from the umbilical chord She
fell off the seat she ended up on the

car floor I asked them to please give

her to me to let me hold her They

didnt They tied the umbilical chord

and we kept going Three minutes had

gone by and my baby was crying My hands
were still tied behind my back and I

was blindfolded They didnt want to

give her to me

()

We get to a different

place and they take me out of the

car I walk into a large shop with

marble countertops They had placed my

baby on one of the countertops She

was dirty crying feeling cold I

begged them to let me be with her and nobody
answered me
They brought two buckets of water and
made me clean everything I had to do
all that naked in front of the
guards who were laughing
Only after that they let me hold my
baby

Your Honor that day I made the
promise that if my baby and I lived
I was going to devote the rest of my
days to see that justice is done

INT - RUSOS APARTMENT - NIGHT

A vinyl record is playing an opera

JULIO returns from the kitchen

RUSO
And the Bettinis You have all
the crimes in one singe family
The entire state terrorism
apparatus condensed First the
son is murdered then the father
is kidnapped and then the
grandmother now for financial
reasons

JULIO
Exactly

RUSO
The kidnapping is an excess by
itself—the fact that it was an
old lady only adds to the horror
And on top of that they did it
to steal their assets

JULIO hands him the tangerine tries to tone down the
conversation

JULIO
Relax Ruso We are doing good

RUSO
Hmmm

JULIO
Seriously were doing good

RUSO
I dont like to hear you say that

103 EXT - LAVALLE ENTRANCE PALACE OF JUSTICE - DAY

JULIO faces a female TV reporter who intercepted him on his way
to the Court

TV REPORTER
Sir today all the media
is reporting a new threat
you have received This
time it was a letter and
in your home

JULIO
Its a meaningless event I
believe it was mostly meant to
intimidate the witnesses and not
so much myself And its a
rather clumsy action because if
they did anything to me theres
always going to be someone who
will replace me

TV REPORTER
So you believe the threats Have
you reported them Is there
someone investigating them

JULIO
The corresponding court will
manage the investigation

TV REPORTER
According to the information the
threat was a letter with the
Argentine Navys letterhead Can
you confirm that

JULIO
I have to get ready for the hearing
Miss Thank you for your concern

JULIO leaves The TV REPORTER goes on

TV REPORTER
That was Prosecutor Strassera who
today faces what is likely the
hardest moments in the trial of the
former commanders the testimonies
of people detained at the Navy
School of Mechanics probably the
largest clandestine detention
center

Everything you brought in is very
good but your case ishow can
I say thisspecial

BARRASA a robust balding man with a mustache is sitting across
the table looking at LUIS and smoking

LUIS
Lets see dont take this the
wrong way Your situation is
different from the other
detainees And the defense

BARRASA
(Gently but sounding nervous)
I dont follow you Sir What
do you mean by different

LUIS
Let me be clear We are trying to
look out for you Im trying to
prevent

BARRASA

Tell me why is it different
Lets see

Leaning against the wall JULIO just observes the situation

LUIS
The defense will try to prove that
you werent a victim but an employee
of the ESMA

BASTERRA
But its the truth I worked for
them They forced me to work for

them

LUIS

©
Precisely And we understand the
context the torture the
threats Our intention in this
meeting is to warn you

LUIS is looking at JULIO trying to get him involved but he keeps
aside

LUIS
What I mean is There are other
ways we could submit your
deposition in writing so we dont
risk difficult questions

BASTERRA
(firmly)
I can answer any question

LUIS
Yes the idea is not to put you
at risk

BARRASA
But I have already risked
myself a lot taking this
evidence out precisely for
this for this trial

(He looks for the words)
They kidnapped me they
tortured me they forced me
to rat out comrades some of
them disappeared because of
me then they forced me to
work against my will forging
documents and IDs

()

I spent many years lying to
the military and lying to
myself I am not going to lie

now Im a victim and I must
be heard

JULIO jumps in finally

JULIO
It is crystal clear

105 INT - COURTROOM - DAY

JULIO and LUIS are on the desk assigned to the prosecution LUIS
is shaking his head saying no Something is not going right
BARRASA is on the witness stand GONZAGA (Masseras defender) is
cross-examining the witness

GONZAGA

Can you describe what that
compensation was

BARRASA
Money to buy a few items and

visits to my family

GONZAGA

ie)
©
w

What was the reason in your
case for granting you to
visit your family

BARRASA

I believe it was part of a
compensation

GONZAGA
Let the witness answer if
that compensation he just
described could be considered
as a retribution for his work
at ESMA

The courtroom is silent the atmosphere is tense BARRASA
hesitates

BARRASA
I was forced to use my
knowledge for a task that I
knew perfectly well to be
illegal the forgery of Ids
And I was forced to do it

GONZAGA
According to the witness
statements every detainee
at ESMA was forced to
perform tasks yet not all
of them were allowed to
leave for family visits as
the witness was

BASTERRA looks in the direction of LUIS and JULIO who are also
tense

GONZAGA
As far as you knew did your
exits and entries had the
same characteristics as those
of the rest of the ESMA
staff such as NCOs or
troops

BARRASA
Not at first But later on
yes since I had a badge
It was quite similar

LUIS leans forward to JULIO

LUIS
They are trashing him

JULIO asks to speak somewhat hesitating

JULIO
Your Honor The evidence
provided by the witness is
eloquent enough to make the
court put a stop to this
incredible harassment from the

defenseto prove if he was a
slave or not

LOSADA
(Stops him)
Mr Prosecutor Are you
suggesting that the defense
should be denied their right to
cross-examine

JULIO
No but these questions are
biased and

LOSADA

Mr Prosecutor The defense has
the right to ask the questions
they deem necessaryand is
the courts right to decide
whether they are appropriate or
not

JULIO
Precisely

BARRASA is alone on the stand looking at both sides

MACO concerned walks into the office LUCAS ISABEL and JUDITH
are sitting in their places not talking They are eavesdropping
on a discussion between LUIS and JULIO in the other room They
all look at MACO who makes a gesture asking what is going on
FEDERICO replies with another gesture indicating a fight

LUIS (OFF)
It looked as if they were
questioning a suspect If you
heard the trial today it
looked like the ESMA was a club
where detainees were just
strolling around

ISABEL shy closes the door A few seconds later FEDERICO opens
it again

107 INT - JULIOS OFFICE PALACE OF JUSTICE - NIGHT

JULIO smokes looking serious indecipherable For the first
time he seems calmer than LUIS

JULIO
If I have to start crying
for every witness that
becomes complicated for
every question from the
judges or for every time the
defendants pressure Id
have to retire Its their
job

LUIS
And ours is to win this
trial To win it at the
indictment at the sentence
and in the streets

JULIO
In the streets Which streets
Talcahuano or Parana

LUIS
Dont patronize me

JULIO
You need to
understand the
limits of our job
Luis

LUIS

(Calming down)
Witnesses are heroes
and we have to take
care of them

JULIO
We are officials of the
Judiciary Officials We
dont get involved with
witnesses we dont get
involved with judges and
we dont let anyone
pressure us Is that clear

LUIS

You know better than
anyone some officials
wash their hands off- and
played dumb during the
entire dictatorship

JULIOs face turns He seems almost offended Or about to have a
violent outburst but he refrains himself He can see the
prosecution kids in the next room surprised looking at them
JULIO slowly approaches the door and closes it

JULIO
For instance who played
dumb

LUIS

You know perfectly well what
Im talking about

JULIO
No I dont Explain

LUIS
I mean that being an
official means nothing
if you dont

JULIO

(Interrupting)
No dont beat around the bush
What are you talking about Luis

ie)

a
LUIS

About the fact that even if
you are an official you have to
take risks and not be
condescending

JULIO
So I dont take risks and I am
condescending

LUIS
I didnt say that But its
not time to

JULIO

(interrupts him)
Yes You said I dont take any
risks that I am condescending
that I am useful to the reigning
power and that Ive spent the
dictatorship playing dumb

LUIS
I never said that Julio Im
talking about something
different

JULIO
Youre inches away from throwing
the files of the habeas corpus I
didnt investigate on my face
Moreno Ocampo

LUIS
Im talking about something else

JULIO
No Youre not talking about
anything else I understand
perfectly what youre talking
about What the fuck do you
think we were doing during the
dictatorship Partying in Punta

money Being protected by the
fact that we belonged to a noble

123 INT - KITCHEN STRASSERAS APARTMENT - NIGHT

JULIO is stirring a cup of instant coffee while telling SILVIA
about the meeting SILVIA behaves as if she is trying to decipher
a secret message

JULIO
It was brief Fifteen
minutes or less

SILVIA
And you told me Bruzzo was
there

JULIO

But he didnt say anything

SILVIA
And why was he there then

JULIO
I dont know Maybe at
Troccolis request

SILVIA
OK and what did the
president say

JULIO
He said I dont have
any instructions for
you

SILVIA
Hmmmm

JULIO
Indeed

SILVIA

Isnt it strange that the
President of the Nation
calls me to a meeting and
then he has nothing to say
Its strange isnt it The
President of the Nation
summons you to a secret
meeting to tell you he has
no indication for you

JULIO
Very strange

SILVIA
So
JULIO
We talked about the trial

SILVIA
But what exactly Can you be more specific

JULIO
He talked about the
testimonies Some of them in
particular That he was
moved That he had met some
of the witnesses He did all
the talking

SILVIA maintains her questioning attitude

SILVIA
And you didnt tell him anything

JULIO

I did I asked what he
expected from the trial

SILVIA
(Excited)
Good Very good What did he say

JULIO
Thats when he said I dont
have any instructions for
you

SILVIA makes a gesture of disappointment She shakes her head
Julio shrugs

SILVIA
Thats it He must
have said something
else

JULIO
In the end when I
was leaving he said
something

SILVIA
(paying a lot of attention)
There it is What did he say

JULIO
He said “I am looking
forward to hear your
indictment”

SILVIA

He said that

JULIO
Yes

SILVIA thinks for a few seconds

SILVIA
Hmmm
Crystal clear

JULIO
What do you think

SILVIA
Separation of powers
Its perfect

JULIO
What do you think

SILVIA
(she gets enthused)
I think that you will have
to write a nice indictment
a hell of an indictment It
needs to be striking
Because many things depend
on that EVERYTHING depends
on that

JULIO
OKI get itplease
dont make me even more
nervous

He steps out to the balcony escaping

124 EXT - STRASSERAS APARTMENT BALCONY - NIGHT

SILVIA follows JULIO

She approaches him from behind

SILVIA
Julio Im going to tell you

never said it says a lot And

I want to say it now before
anyone

JULIO
Come on Silvia

SILVIA
Im proud of you

JULIO
You are not helping me
with that

SILVIA

Well I dont care This beat
up country needs people like
you

JULIO
Like me

SILVIA
Do you know what it is like
for me that I always
thought I was married to a
skeptical apathetic grumpy
man to now have
everybody tell me I’m
married to a national hero

JULIO
(Surprised)
Who tells you that

SILVIA
It doesn’t matter they do
They say you are a hero of
the nationthe nation

JULIO
Leave the nation aside

SILVIA
Well have it your way

JULIO

And heroes dont exist

great respect for the
military

NEUSTADT
It doesn’t look that way

LUIS

Pity because I feel part
of the military family

NEUSTADT
Is that so Are you aware
that most of the military in
this country hate you

LUIS
Well I dont know if
its most of them
Some military may not
like what we are
doing but others do

NEUSTADT
Do you think there are
military who like

LUIS
Let me ask you a
question Bernardo
Do you know who
Francisco Ortiz de
Ocampo was

NEUSTADT
A relative of yours I take
it
LUIS
Indeed my great grandfather
The first Commander in
Argentine history The very
first one Do you think I
could have anything against
the military institution The
thing is I am a lawyer the
law is my obsession and I
cannot allow those who broke
it to get away with it What
prosecutor Strassera and I
want is on one side to
provide apart from giving
justice for the victims is
to help restore the prestige
of the military institution
To put and end to the use of
death as a political tool
That’s what we all want
isn’t that so

NEUSTADT
Yes of course

LUIS
That’s what the country
needs Respect and Justice

JULIO
A direct simple

this

The Argentine
community and the
law have commended
us the mission of
coming before you to
demand justice

JULIO

Also that its impossible
to talk about all the
thousands of individual
cases and that the chosen
cases don’t represent the
magnitude of the

SOMI
Genocide

JULIO
Genocide yes

JULIO throws his hands to his

A black and white image of LUIS in a new TV interview fills up the
screen

LUIS (ON TV)
The emblem they used which
was a synthesis of the
emblems of the three
branches is a clear symbol
of what I am saying the
only ones capable of
authorizing that a person
who was kidnapped by the
Army would then be taken to
a Navy clandestine center
and transferred on an Air
Force place was the Military
Junta This is why they
carry the ultimate
responsibility for every
crime

LUIS MOTHER smiles while seeing his son talking on the TV with
one of her friends LUIS looks satisfied

Your Honors The Argentine
community in particular but
also the universal juridical
conscience have entrusted me
with the huge mission of
standing before this court to
demand justice

SILVIA watches him

JULIO
Technical and factual reasons
such as the absence of a
specific definition in our
domestic law that could
accurately describe the type
of crime that is on trial
today and the impossibility
to consider one by one all the
thousands of cases have led me
to decide to hear the
depositions through 17
dramatic weeks of the trial
of only 709 of the thousands
of cases that certainly do not
cover the bloodcurdling number
of victims of what we could
describe as the greatest
genocide in our countrys
young history

SOMI and the Prosecution Offices kids are watching him

describe it Your Honors I
can do with three words

CUT TO

A close-up on JULIO who goes on with his indictment

JULIO
ferocious clandestine
and cowardly

A slow lateral traveling shot moves from the audience sitting on
the side grades down to the desk from where JULIO is speaking We
see the faces of the DEFENDANTS listening to him

JULIO
The guerrillas kidnapped
tortured and killed What did
the State do to fight them
Kidnap torture and kill in
an infinitely larger scale
and what is even worse
outside the legal system
And from then onwards Your
Honors much more serious
consequences emerged
Because how many of the
victims of repression were
guilty of illegal activities
How many were innocent We

will never know
not the victims

JULIO is speaking with determination

“We will not tolerate death
roaming free in Argentina
Slowly almost in such way

its iniquity over the unaware
and the innocent amidst the
disbelief of some the
complicity of others and the
stupefaction of many”

JULIO (CONT’D)
This process has meant for
those of us who have had the
painful privilege of knowing
it deeply a sort of descent
into dark areas of the human
soul where misery abjection
and horror reach depths which
are hard to imagine in
advance and impossible to
understand afterwards Dante
Alighieri in “The Divine
Comedy” saved the seventh
circle of hell for the
violent ones for all those
who hurt others through the
use of force And in that
same hell he submerged ina
river of boiling and
nauseating blood a specific
type of doomed people the
poet described as follows
“These are the tyrants who
dealt in bloodshed and
pillaging Here they lament
their pitiless mischiefs”

courtroom are getting emotional

JULIO
For all this Your Honor
this trial and its conviction
are important and necessary
for the Argentine Nation
which has been offended by
atrocious crimes Their very
atrocity turns the mere
hypothesis of impunity into a
monstrous one Unless the
moral sense of the Argentines
has descended to tribal
levels nobody can allow that
kidnapping torture and
murder become political
incidents or ‘collateral
damage in combat Now that
the Argentine people have
recovered the government and
the control of its
institutions I take the
responsibility of stating on
its behalf that sadism is
neither a political ideology
nor a war strategy it is a
moral perversion

We see SOMI almost crying listening to the last part of the
speech

JULIO
This trial and the sentence I
am advocating for make us
responsible for the
establishment of peace A
peace not based in oblivion
but in memory not in
violence but in justice This
is our opportunity it might
be the last one

There is a pause JULIO looks to the sides looks at the audience
recognizes some of the witnesses The silence in the courtroom is
absolute He looks at his papers and finds the last handwritten
notes he made LUIS is looking at him waiting for him to go on
SOMI and SILVIA too Finally he reads

JULIO (CONT’D)
Your Honors I want to
deliberately relinquish any
pretension of originality to
close this indictment I want
to use a phrase that doesnt
belong to me because it
already belongs to the
Argentine people
