EXT SCHOOL BUS - DAY
Its a warm spring day End of May

Establishing

INT SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS

Rod is driving a bus filled with grade schoolers He has a
He talks

black eye and he operates the clutch with a stick
to a THIRD GRADE GIRL in a KARATE uniform in the front seat
This is OLIVIA 8 level-headed without being precocious

Rods confidante

ROD
I cant completely describe the
feeling but when I collided with the
side of the bus I felt like I
connected with some ancient life
force

OLIVIA
Oh

ROD
Maybe it was the way my moped and I
accelerated into a stationary object
at twenty-seven miles per hour or
maybe it was the fact that I forgot
to eat breakfast that morning but
for a brief fleeting second I felt
like the first amoeba who grew legs
and walked out of the primordial
eoze You know what I mean

OLIVIA
Not really So you didnt make the
jump

ROD

When did you get so ends-oriented
No technically I didnt make the
jump in your traditional western
sense of the word but it was a
success in other ways Namely it
taught me a lot about myself my
bone structure vis a vis which
joints bend which way and it
revealed certain technical
limitations of my crew

OLIVIA
Oh

ROD
Rod hands

Youve got to learn to respect the
journey Olivia Thats the key to
enlightenment Thats what the Tao
teaches us Read your Lao Tse
Its all in there

Olivia an orange piece of paper

ROD (CONT’D)
Here Im jumping the incinerator
tomorrow morming You should ask
your mom if you can go

OLIVIA
But doesnt your leg still hurt

ROD
I wont lie to you Olivia Its
incredibly painful If I was in the
wild right now Id try to chew it
off But the show must go on

OLIVIA
Why don’t you just rest until your
leg feels better

ROD
Well thats impossible We already
made the fliers

OLIVIA
dust make new ones

ROD
Oh Olivia New fliers require
paper and a Xerox machine And

paper Its very complicated

Olivia locks at the FLIER and shakes her head

ROD CONTD
What

OLIVIA
I just dont understand why you need
to hurt yourself all the time

ROD
(laughing too hard)
Need to hurt myself Thats
ridiculous Olivia Im a stuntman
Getting hurt is an occupational
hazard
oa
OLIVIA
Do you love being a stuntman

a
ROD
Of course I do You know that

OLIVIA
And stuntmen get hurt

ROD
Sometimes yes

OLIVIA
Then by the transitive property you
love getting hurt

ROD

Jesus What goes on in that school

of yours Do you have a Communist

teacher or something

(then)

Look youre too young to understand

things like fate and destiny but

when you grow up youre going to

think about bigger things than

spelling bees and karate practice

Youre going to think about what
Co kind of mark youre going to leave

“ on this world when youre gone We

all have destinies in this life my

young young friend And for better

or worse my destiny is danger

Rod stops the bus and reaches to open the door WINCING in
pain

ROD (CONTD)
Ahh

OLIVIA
I got it

Olivia stands up and opens the BUS DOOR with two hands

ROD
Thanks

OLIVIA
Youre a good person Rod
Experiencing pain isnt the only way
to give your life meaning

Rod stares at Olivia blankly

He moves through the crowd and walks UPSTAIRS
INT FRANKS BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER

Rod enters the bedroom FURIOUS Its filled with CRYING
PEOPLE Marie APPROACHES him

MARIE
Oh Rod Thank god youre here

ROD
I dont know whats worse letting
your own flesh and blood rot in jail
all day or neglecting to invite him
to a block party thrown in his own
house

Marie starts to CRY Rod SOFTENS

ROD (CONTD)
Im sorry Mom Im sure it was a
last minute thing Everyone seems
to be having a good time

Rod hears the BEEP from a HEART MONITOR He sees Frank
semiconscious in his bed with a PRIEST standing over him
praying Rod then realizes that most of the guests are

CRYING

ROD (CONTD)
Whats happening Is this some sort
of interactive theater art piece

DB

MARIE
Its Frank Hes dying

ROD
What Since when

MARIE
For the last twenty-one years Its
his heart He needs a transplant
Hes been on every list but they
never picked him Hes too high
risk they say Times running out
Oh Rod I cant lose him

She SOBS Rod HUGS her

MARIE (CONTD)
We never told you about his
condition because we knew how much
it would upset you

ROD
So you just decided to keep it from
me and Kevin

MARIE
Oh no Kevin knows We just
didnt think you could handle it

In the background we see that Kevin has moved to Franks
bedside Frank takes off his WATCH and hands it to him

Kevin HUGS Frank

ROD

1 dont know what to believe in
anymore Am I ina dream inside of
a dream Am I the dreamer or has
someone dreamed me Who am I Why

I need water

Rod goes to leave Marie grabs his arm
MARIE
Rod he may not have much time left
Go say your good-byes

ROD
No He cant die now

IN THE BACKGROUND WE SEE Frank taking off a GOLD MAN
BRACELET and handing it to Kevin

MARIE
Thats a sweet thing to say Rod

ROD
Frank needs to see me jump the
fountains at Caesars Palace
Theres got to be something we can

do

MARIE
Weve tried everything The only
hope is an experimental medical
trial and Franks insurance wont
pay If we could come up with the
money we could get him in But
where are we going to get four
hundred and fifty thousand dollars

ROD
Ill get the money somehow He
cant die now

Rod RUSHES to Franks bedside Marie turns to a fellow
mourner CAROL mid-fifties

MARTE
I knew Rod would take this hard
Theyre very close
FRANK

In his deathbed He whispers something to Kevin

REVIN

Rod PUSHES Kevin away from FRANK

ROD

ROD

MARIE

We can see Rod struggling over

DB

ON FRANK
Rod holds

Rod pulls

Rod HAULS
The WHOLE

Rod was really lucky to get a
stepfather who took as much of an
interest in his life as Frank did

CAROL
Were all very lucky to have known
Prank
up his fists Frank smiles

FRANK
Its go easy Rod Hit me - I love
you Dont hit me -- I die and you
live out your empty hollow life
suffocating in the knowledge that
youve never received paternal
approval Its a no brainer Rod

Do it

ROD
Iocan’t Its wrong

FRANK
I knew it You dont have the
stuff Youll never have the
stuffilt

ROD
Aieeee

OFF and PUNCHES the WALL right over Frank‘s head
ROOM turns shocked to see what happened

ROD (CONTD)
Im going to get you well Frank so
I can beat you fair and square
That is my pledge to you

Rod RUNS OUT

EXT LAKE

KEVIN
Rod are you okay

ROD
I need to go to my quiet place

LATER

DB

Rod sits on a log in a beautiful isolated part of the forest
PLAYING HIS FRENCH HORN Hes really BAD A SQUIRREL
stands in front of him and LISTENS to his horrible music

Rod gets caught up in the drama of the piece feeling each
note He STARTS TO CRY This makes him play even harder

Rods CRIES turn into SOBS Each blow of the horn is an
EXPLOSION of blubbering tears

Through his tears and high-pitched French horn SCREECHES
Rod hears a distant sound from across the lake It seems to
be music playing in response to him The SQUIRREL TURNS

He hears it too

Rod plays a few notes and LISTENS Those same notes are
played back He plays a couple more Theyre played back
too Rod dries his tears as he sets off in pursuit of this
mystery musician

He continues to play as he follows the sound His walk
turns into a run as he circles the lake to find the source
And then like destiny behind a tree sits a young Japanese
woman with a TRUMPET This is KYOKO SUZUKI twenties
scholarly and proper She LOOKS UP EXPRESSIONLESS Rod is

AMAZED

ROD
Who are you person

Ryoko looks at him and says nothing She WEARS a sticker
that says HELLO MY NAME IS KYOKO Rod reads her
nametag

ROD (CONTD)
Kyoko Right on

EXT LAKE - LATER

Rod and Kyoko walk through the WOODS Rod pours out his
guts

ROD
I chose the path of an international
superstar stuntman because it was my
destiny But what is destiny Is
there a great architect up there
with hisher master design for life
or are we alone in the universe
spinning around with fate nothing
more than a comforting explanation
for our real purpose --to pass on
our genetic material to future
generations

A beat Kyoko looks at him expressionless

ROD (CONTD)
God you are so easy to talk to I
feel like the last two hours and
forty-six minutes just dissolved in
one second I know this sounds
crazy but I want to spend the rest
of my life with you

Kyoko looks blankly at Rod

ROD (CONTD)
You make me feel like I can do
anything You make me feel like I
can get that four hundred and fifty
thousand dollars to save Franks
life and get him healthy so I can
kick his teeth in and win his love

Kyoko just looks at Rod

ROD (CONTD)
My god Kyoko I feel like Im
seeing in color for the first time
in my life Youve given me the
greatest gift of all Kyoko Youve
given me back my manhood

Rod smiles and kisses Kyokos hand She stares blankly and
then pulls a small VIDEO CAMERA from her bag

ROD (CONTD)
Oh are you a camera nut

She starts to video Rod

ROD (CONTD)
Okay sure Shoot away
(into camera)
Hi Im Rod Kimble

She keeps the camera trained on him

ROD (CONTD)

ROD
As you all know the last two days
have been very difficult for me I
was fired from my job and I
discovered that my stepfather Frank
- a man with whom I have a very
complicated relationship -- is on
his deathbed Yesterday for
fourteen minutes I thought about
different ways of killing myself
Some ways spectacular some ways
pretty sad And then this special
yellow someone walked into my life
Everybody meet Kyoko My soulmate

Everyone looks at Kyoko who just stares back at them
blankly She pulls out her video camera and starts

shooting

ROD (CONTD)
Shes my girlfriend now Shes also
a real shutterbug
(matter of factly)
Im putting her in charge of
operations

KEVIN
But thats my job
ROD
Do not make me end you Kevin Do

Al Geiser cheerily puts his hand out to Kyoko

AL GEISER

DB

Kyoko points the camera at Al Geiser and ignores his hand

AL GEISER (CONTD)

RICO

DB

(excited)

tremendous business skills Got it

KEVIN

ROD
and last night Kyoko and I devised a
plan to come up with the rest

Rod reveals a notebook with a chart of earnings calculations
drawn in crayon across the page He tilts it toward Kyokos

camera

ROD (CONTD)

EUGENE

Heres a good angle Koko Of my

erotch
Rod smacks Eugene in the head again

ROD

three hundred mile radius Im
talking alligator wrestling pie

phenomenon

Rod turns the page in the notebook The new page has lots
of crayon bar graphs

DAVE

columns And colors This jump

requires major training That means
no compromises From here on out

ROD (CONTD)

Soul of a bottlenose dolphin

Rod gets into the tub of water He makes a TINY DOLPHIN
SOUND and SUBMERGES Kevin hits the stopwatch Al Eugene
Rico and Dave HOLD ROD DOWN

Three seconds tick by On the fourth Rod starts to THRASH
around wildly Rod pulls on the string but it falls off the
bell and no one notices The rope FLAILS around as Rod

EXT BUS PARKING LOT - DAY

Rod stands beside a TRAMPOLINE with stacks of sand bags all
around He addresses his crew and Kyoko who continues to
videotape all proceedings

ROD
Okay now were going to focus on
body control and gravity management
These skills are vital for any
successful stunt

Rod tries to suavely swing himself up on the trampoline It
doesnt work After a STRUGGLE he manages to hook one leg
over the edge and AWKWARDLY pull himself up He stands
winded His legs are RUBBERY as he tries to steady himself
and look confident

ROD (CONTD)
Youll notice that next to you there
are several sandbags I am going to
jump higher and higher into the air
and I want you to take these
sandbags and hurl them at me with
all your strength Any questions

AL GEISER
I did the hammer throw in high

ROD
Do what you need to do Al I

and by all appearances grand mal seizure He lunges across
the cashier counter knocking down shelves and making unholy

sounds

DENISE (CONTD)
Rod this is not hypoglycemia

Rod spastically heaves back and forth across the restaurant

payphone He calmly takes the phone off the receiver and
slams it repeatedly until the whole thing breaks apart into
tiny pieces Change explodes everywhere Rod dives on the
floor and throws the change against the wall awkwardly with
his still-gloved hands

Exhausted and crying Rod pounds the demolished payphone
with his gloved fists

INT JAIL CELL MOMENTS LATER

dramatically

No reaction from the group

ROD (CONTD)

The DA is reviewing her case and
were praying for leniency

Heres the not so good news I used

last six weeks from contests and
birthday parties an amount in
excess of three thousand dollars
after mysterious city taxes were
factored in to gain her freedom I
also used the three thousand Kevin
gave me We now have zero dollars
for the dream

The crew stares at him quietly furious Rod is a little
unsure how to handle it

ROD (CONTD)
Okay Everyones shocked Thats
understandable But I think the
only way to work through this is
with communication and humor --

Kevin stands up walks over to Rod and PUNCHES him in the
jaw Rod drops out of frame like a sack of hammers

ROD (CONTD)
Nicely played Kevin I deserved
that Okay lets dialogue

KEVIN
I sold my car to give you that

TAKESHI
It is in disrepair

ROD
Well be that as it may it has a
lot of sentimental value I know
youll find this impossible to
believe but in high school I got
teased a lot Id ride my moped to
school and the kids would call it
the fagrider Sometimes theyd
paint the word “fagrider on its
side and sometimes theyd pee on it
But that all just made me stronger
This moped has become a symbol of my
ability to demonstrate courage in
the face of adversity

Takeshi nods and makes a notation in his clipboard

TAKESHI
Get new stunt vehicle
ROD
Very good
TAKESHI

TAKESHI
Who is that Rod Kimble

ROD
My father He was a stuntman too
He used to test Evel Knievels bikes
for him before the big jumps One
afternoon the old man was testing a
bike for Evel in the Houston
Astrodome 27 buses in a row That
was nothing for the big guy He did
that kind of thing all the time and
he let Evel get the glory Anyway
that day Pops nailed the takeoff but
when he landed something terrible
happened The front wheel exploded
like a cannonball and the handlebars
went right through his head It was
amess Blood was everywhere His
teeth were ground to a powder and
the front of his face exploded out
of the back of his skull He died
instantly

TAKESHI
My god Thats horrible

ROD
Jumping the fountains at Caesars
Palace was the old mans lifelong
dream When my mom married Frank I
insisted on keeping my last name to
honor my father I guess in a way
I became a stuntman to fulfill his
unfinished legacy I mean not ina

picture came from Its the only
picture I have of your father
Well I didnt know how to explain
to a four-year-old boy that his
father just up and ran off to
Dubuque with a stripper so I let the
white lies build

ROD
He ran off with a stripper

MARIE
Her names was Nancy

ROD
Nancy Gross

MARIE
Rod you always such a wonderful
imagination as a boy You started
making up all these fantastic
stories because of this picture and
I just didnt have the heart to tell
you it wasnt true I thought it
was a just a phase youd grow out
of But the stories kept getting
bigger and bigger Before long
they took on a life of their own and
there was no turning back So I
played along But only because I
didnt want to hurt you Im sorry
Rod But you have to believe me --
I did it out of love

Oh dear sweet asscracking Christ

AKIRA
So Rod I wag able to make the

elements in order to make the event
more marketable

dont care I fear nothing now
AKIRA
Takeshi get the Australian sand

through my town and jump it over
sticks People would call me
gaikessan crazy bike I always
dreamed of jumping my bicycle over
the river near my house Every day
I would go to the rivers edge and
try to muster the courage to do it
But I never could I was too
seared I never followed through on
my dangerous dreams Deep down I
have felt like a failure all my
life ‘That’s why I push myself so
hard in business -- to
overcompensate for this gnawing
self-hatred forged in childhood In
a lot of ways Im using you to
overcome these feelings of low self--
worth

hard That can take more strength
and courage than a million stunts
