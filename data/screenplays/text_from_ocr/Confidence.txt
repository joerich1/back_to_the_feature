JAKE (VO)
So Im dead

FADE IN
EXT - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT (PRESENT

Dumpsters overflow with the days garbage A pillar of
steam rises from an underground grate Its the dark
place between buildings that a reasonable person avoids

We see JAKE VIG a guy in his late 20s whose fashionable
suit and good looks are in obvious contrast to the
surroundings-- At first glance youd think he could run
for Congress some day At first glance

Jake faces a garbage dumpster on his knees execution
style His face gives away nothing-- He could be kneeling
in a strawberry field

JAKE (VO)
And I think its because of this
redhead
BUTCH (0S)
Know who I am Jake
JAKE
The Anti-Christ
BUTCH (0S)
No Im not the Anti-Christ Or the
Prince of Darkness Im just a guy

looking for some answers

Theres the LOUD UNMISTAKABLE CLICK of a gun being
cocked The barrel of a gun slides gently along Jakes
ear and comes to rest at the base of his skull

The voice and the gun belong to BUTCH (40s) With his
suit and conservative looks youd make him out for a
Steve or Roger more than a Butch

BUTCH (cont d)
Things are probably going to end badly
for you Jake

JAKE
Gee What makes you say that

BUTCH
Your life flashing before your eyes

JAKE
Just the last three weeks

( )

BUTCH
Thats not a bad place to start
CUT TO
EXT - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT
Title Three Weeks Ago
The same alley The door of a building bursts open as

LIONEL DOLBY (late 40s) dressed in a cheap suit stumbles
out breathing heavy The dim light of a bare bulb glares
off the sweat on his forehead

A moment later Jake emerges from the same door carrying
a large black revolver

JAKE
I lost my head Im Sorry I dont
know what happened

LIONEL
Y-y-you fucking shot him Thats what
happened

JAKE
I had to That motherfucker was about
to welch You saw what he was doing
right You heard him

Lionel starts shaking his head spastically

LIONEL
I cant be here You understand I
can t--

JAKE

Listen to me It went to shit It
happens sometimes

In the distance A POLICE SIREN WAILS growing louder

LIONEL
Oh Jesus

JAKE
LISTEN to me We dont have much time
We can still get through this but you
have to keep your head and trust me

Jake takes a tentative step forward Lionel sees a BLOOD
STAIN on Jakes shirt and recoils

The SIREN GROWS LOUDER Jake turning his head towards it

( )

LIONEL
What-- What do we do

JAKE
Help me

Jake waves Lionel back through the door they came out of
CUT TO
INT - THE EUCLID BAR

A dive furnished with a few mismatched chairs and a bar

A single overweight PATRON sits at a corner table with
face buried in his hands as he WHIMPERS Jake and Lionel
Dolby pass him as they emerge from a back hallway

MILES late 20s wipes blood off the bar Placed at the
edge of the bar are two briefcases both open both filled
with neat stacks of blood splattered money

A DEAD GUY lies face down on the floor in a pool of blood

Jake grabs the Dead Guys legs as Lionel watches in
disbelief

JAKE
Come on Grab his arms

Lionel stands frozen Jake drops the dead guys legs
with a THUD

JAKE
Lionel Hes dead Yeah maybe you
didnt pull the trigger but you were
standing right there and watched me do
it Help me Grab his arms

The POLICE SIRENS grow LOUDER

MILES
Tick-tock
JAKE
If you wanna help then help If not
shut up
MILES
Your mess
JAKE

Then shut up

MILES
My place

( )

Miles lets out a little chuckle its just enough to set
Jake off again

Jake pulls the gun and points it at Miles

MILES
Oh please

Miles non-chalantly pulls a sawed off shot gun frown under
the bar

MILES (cont d)
You think this kinda shit hasnt happened
here before Given its usually on
Thursdays And usually I gotta tell
the cops No Officer I didnt really
get a good look at the shooters
Usually anyway

PATRON
(without looking up)
I didnt see nothing And I swear if
you let me go now I wont say-

JAKE
Relax porkchop

The POLICE SIRENS sound like theyre right outside

LIONEL
I cant be here

Jake cocks his gun never taking his stare off Miles

JAKE
Then go

Lionel looks at the briefcases of bloodied money

LIONEL
What about The money

JAKE
What about this situation makes you
think I can answer that question right
now

Lionel again looks at the briefcases then the shotgun
leveled at Jake then at the direction of the POLICE
SIRENS He runs for the door without a second thought

CUT TO
EXT- THE EUCLIDCITY SIDEWALK- NIGHT

Lionel emerges up the stairs from the basement level bar
to street-level just as a POLICE CAR SCREECHES to a halt
in front of the bar lights flashing SIREN WAILING On
the door is the emblem for the NEW YORK POLICE
DEPARTMENT

Lionel does his best to look casual as TWO UNIFORMED
OFFICERS jump out of the car and rush the Euclid One of
the Officers catches Lionel looking over his shoulder
The last thing Lionel hears before he turns a corner--

OFFICER (0OS)
Everybody FREEZE

As soon as hes turned the corner Lionel breaks into a
full sprint down the street

CUT TO
INT- THE EUCLID
OFFICER WALTER SOBOZINSKI a middle aged cop with a couple
of spare tires stands by the front door with his gun
drawn in a dramatic stance
SOBOZINSKI
(yelling)
I said freeze you motherfucking
cocksucking scumbags

The second middle aged cop OFFICER RICHARD ROTTOVICH
comes calmly down the stairs behind Sobozinski

ROTTOVICH
Were clear

Rottovich closes the door and locks it behind him
SOBOZINSKI
(still yelling)
Or Ill blow off every one of your
fucking heads
Sobozinski lets out a bellowing LAUGH

We PAN OVER TO REVEAL Jake Miles and BIG AL (the Patron)
sitting at the bar by the Dead Guy

JAKE
Stop waving that thing around

MILES
You sure were clear

( )

ROTTOVICH
Guy looked like he was trying not to
shit himself
(re the Dead Guy)
Nice

DEAD GUY
What took so fucking long

The Dead Guy stirs-- GORDO late 20s dressed in a blood
soaked suit stands up wiping blood off his face

DEAD GUYGORDO
Ive been lying in this shit like half
the night

MILES
You guys were late We had to go toa
Mexican stand-off

JAKE
And you know I hate guns

Jake tosses the revolver on the bar

SOBOZINSKI
We were fighting crime

MILES
Keeping the city streets safe for drug
dealers and pedophiles everywhere

Jake starts taking the money out of the briefcases Gordo
strips out of the jacket and shirt revealing a THIN WHITE
VEST A wire runs from a battery pack on his belt up

the center of the vest ending at a scorched bloody
explosive squib

Gordo drops the vest along with a plastic bag containing
fake blood A nasty bruise on his chest marks the spot
where the squib was

GORDO
Shit

JAKE
I told you use less powder

GORDO
But you wont get that splatter effect

Jake removes the blood stained bills from the top of the
pile

( )

JAKE
Then these go into your cut

Big Al moves over to the bar

BIG AL
Hey Jake When am I gonna get to
play the Inside

JAKE
Gordo plays the inside Youre the
Shill

BIG AL
Yeah but come on All I get to do is

cry and get insulted

JAKE

get a fucking Academy Award for the
Shill work you do

(off Als smile)
We got it down cold Al You dont
want to jinx it by changing something
up do you

BIG AL

eggrolls

Al slaps Jake on the back and exits
Jake catches Gordo hawking over his shoulder

JAKE
What I can feel you looking at me

GORDO
Thats a lot of cash He came up with
it pretty quick

JAKE
Probably some investment banker or
convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead Did
you see how fast he ran out of here
Its done Hes not coming back

GORDO
I guess I gotta drop a dime Did
anybody mess up the hoop

MILES
Its clean

Gordo disappears dawn the back hallway

( )

Jake rubber bands two small wads of cash and hands

to Rottovich and Sobozinski

JAKE
Ten percent

SOBOZINSKI
You guys got sack Ill give you that
much

JAKE

ROTTOVICH
(patting his pocket)

ROTTOVICH

SOBOZINSKI

JAKE

ROTTOVICH
Dont get me wrong Jake I like you
boys You guys are the steadiest
business in town But what can I say
Twenty percents still better than
what we give to any of the other
criminals

JAKE
All the shit we pulled with you and

ROTTOVICH

threat

( )

Sobozinski and Rottovich head for the door with their
newly padded pockets

ROTTOVICH (cont d)

CUT TO

INT- FOUR SEASONS HOTEL- NIGHT
A suite in the upscale hotel Miles answers a KNOCK on
the door-- An expensive CALL GIRL stands at the door in
an overcoat
JAKE (VO)
Its what makes us run And despite
what they say it can buy you love

CALL GIRL
Are you ready for me Ralph

She lets the overcoat fall open revealing her lack of
clothing

CUT TO
INT- PRADA STORE- NIGHT

Gordo stands in front of a mirror trying on a new suit
The sales people fawn over him

( )

JAKE (VO)
It can buy you a new and better you

GORDO
I just dont know if this says me
Whats the fabric

CUT TO
INT- BIG ALS APARTMENT- NIGHT
Big Al has a cordless phone to his ear

JAKE (VO)
It can erase all those things about you
that you wish didnt exist

BIG AL
Its Alfonse I want to settle up I
havent been ducking you I told you
Id get it

Big Al picks up a CHINESE TAKE-OUT MENU and leafs through
it while on the phone

CUT TO
EXT- SOHO STREET- NIGHT

Jake walks down the crowded street passing the bars and
restaurants of SoHo His jackets buttoned up to hide
the blood stains

JAKE (VO)
It can make you think youre on top of
the world

Jake passes a group of well-dressed well manicured people
waiting in line outside of a trendy bar called Wax

Among the hip and well dressed he seems out of place at
the moment An outsider

An attractive blonde in her late twenties LILY bumps
into Jake

LILY
(innocently)
Oops

She throws Jake a smile he cant but help return They

stand for a second facing each other before shes whisked
away by an OLDER MAN dressed in an expensive suit

( )

Jakes smile fades as he watches her saunter into the
bar but not before she throws him another glance over
her shoulder Jake continues on into

CUT TO
INT- NEIGHBORHOOD BAR- CONTINUOUS
A semi-crowded bar Not hip and trendy like Wax

Jake finds an empty stool at the end of the bar and orders
a drink He takes a second to look around at the cliques
of people talking laughing having a good time before he
pulls a newspaper out his coat pocket

Jake takes a pen from the bar and opens to the crossword
section

JAKE (VO)
And if you believe that money can do
all that for you youre the perfect
mark Jack Kerouac said that if you
own a rug you own too much I dont
necessarily like Kerouac and driving
cross country isnt exactly my idea of
a good time but the guys got a
point

Jake sits alone with his crossword puzzle
CUT TO
INT- JAKES APARTMENT- LATER

Jake enters a sparsely furnished loft The skyline of
Brooklyn twinkles through dirty picturesque windows

Jake drops his keys on a table and hits a button on an
answering machine

ANSWERING MACHINE
You have no new messages

JAKE (VO)
If youve got nothing youve got
nothing to lose And when it comes to
money finding it and losing it you
always gotta remember how much of its
just luck

Jake stands his sparse little world addressing the quiet
before he fishes for his wallet which he cant find

LILY (V O )
Oops

( )

The realization makes Jake smile
Then a FLAPPING SOUND spins him around to see a PIGEON
flapping up against the inside of a partially opened

window

Visibly upset by the bird Jake moves towards the window
and pushes it wide allowing the bird to escape

JAKE
Dumb fucking luck

Jake stares out the window after the bird

CUT TO
INT- DOLBYS APARTMENT- NIGHT
A nicer apartment than Jakes Lionel Dolby the Mark
from the Euclid rushes around haphazardly throwing
things into a suitcase Theres a KNOCK on the door that
stops Lionel dead in his tracks
Another KNOCK Lionel still frozen
The door flies open with a BOOM In the doorway we see
HARLIN an older mountain of a man dressed in a plain

black suit Behind him is LUPUS (late-20s) dressed in
a sweatsuit a pilot could spot from 20000ft

LUPUS

on the floor in the middle of the room and picks up the
phone

JAKE

MILES (0S)

( )

Miles hangs up before Jake can answer
CUT TO
INT- BIG AL’S- DAY

Jake stands with Miles in the sparse living room Big
AIs body sits reclining on a Lazy Boy chair eyes bulging
open An open carton of food rests in his lap A feast
of take-out Chinese surrounds him The TV blares an old
episode of The Little Rascals

Theres a singed neat bullet hole in his forehead

MILES
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast
He likes that new IHOP they just opened

The Rutti-Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing
they got

JAKE
Miles

MILES
Sorry Im just Look what they did
to him Right in the middle of his egg-
foo-young

Big Al stares up at them with those bulging vacant eyes
his mouth hanging open Jake reaches down and grabs the
remote control and turns the TV off

JAKE (VO)
Big Al used to send money to his Father
some Vietnam Vet slowly losing his mind
in a VA hospital in Cleveland Al was
like that Thats why Al never played
the Inside

CUT TO
INT- DINER- DAY

Gordo enters and takes a seat in the back booth with Jake
and Miles

GORDO
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a
sudden case of drowning last night
They just pulled him out of the East River

JAKE
Well this is just fucking great

( )

GORDO
It gets worse Now I know why he was
such a good rope X mean cash
That much and we never had to put him
on the Send Turns out this ducking
Moe was an accountant for the King Pin

Gordo throws Jake a hard look letting the news sink in
Jake can only slump back into the booth

MILES
Whos that

GORDO
The cash we fleeced off of him was
collection money He was supposed to
take that money and give it to the
King earlier yesterday like he does
every Thursday Cept this time he
figured he could make a little
something for himself off us and still
get the Kings money back before any
body says boo

MILES
Whats a King Pin

Gordo looks to Jake but can see that hes still processing
the information

GORDO
Currently the King Pin is a very large-
type pole stuck up our asses

MTLES
Mob

GORDO
Independant Same shit just
independant They call him the King
Pin because he looks like that guy from
the comic book Big Fat Bald

MILES
So what We hide right

GORDO

(shaking his head)
What are you New Let me tell you
how good this guy is Last night Al
calls this bookie to settle up
Apparently hes been ducking him for
like a month So the guy asks him where
hes got all this money all of a sudden
right What does Al do

( )

GORDO (contd)
Does he tell him that he cashed ina
fucking Bar Mitzvah bond Does he tell
him hes been giving head out back for
twenty bucks a pop No He starts
going on about this job he just pulled
and how he fleeced some Wall Street
asshole -type How HE fleeced

MILES
Youre pissed we didnt get credit

GORDO
No that was the only semi-fucking smart
thing he said Except anybody thats
ever met Big Al knows that the only
thing hes comfortable doing alone is
eating This guys tells this guy that
guy tells some other guy eventually it
works its way back to someone who works
for the King and--

grifter comes in here with a fifteen

JAKE

him They take him by the wrists and hold his hands up
for the King

KING PIN (cont d)
I dont like to ask things more than
once Junior I want you to know how
much that irks me

The King begins to gently trace between Jakes fingers
with the nail file

Jake remains rigid against Lupus and Harlin as the nail
file scrapes along the soft fleshy webbing between his
fingers

Jake shuts his eyes Then opens them to find the King
now gently stroking his hands-- Almost a loving caress

KING PIN
You have incredibly soft hands Good
cuticles They re like a babys hands
Grifters with rough hands You know
that theyre probably not that good
Means theyve had to do some hard
labor to make ends meet But you

ASHBY

LILY
On me For the seat Cheers

She flashes a trademark smile as they CLINK glasses

LILY
So weve been meeting with banks all
day Its amazing how many ways they
can say no without ever using the
word

( )

ASHBY
Well typically corporate loans are
relatively simple matters but you do
need to demonstrate a capacity for gross
fund recovery

Lily arches an eyebrow at Ashby
LILY

Dont tell me you started a tech firm
here before us

ASHBY
No no Nothing like that I work in
a bank

LILY

(leaning in)

So he finally goes in there kicks ina
stall door and starts yelling And
theres Gordo pants at the ankles
holding a PC World Magazine

More LAUGHS

GORDO
I havent been able to use a public
bathroom since

LUPUS

Well typically speaking theyre not
As long as you can demonstrate--

( )

JAKE
A capacity for gross fund recovery
Yeah we got that part

ASHBY
Thats right And tech firms They
tend to scare people off

JAKE
They scare people off because most
people lack vision Vision and balls
Present company excluded of course

ASHBY
Banks need to know how theyre going to
get their money back

JAKE
We know exactly how were going to make
The money back There in lies the
Catch-22

ASHBY
I dont follow

An uncomfortable silence falls

GORDO
Jake

LILY
Its alright Grants one of the good
guys

She throws Ashby a flirty smile

LUPUS
Yeah Hes our boy

Lupus casually punches Ashby in the arm Its meant to

be a friendly tap but its hard enough to jerk Ashbys

head to the side Ashby lets out an uncomfortable LAUGH
as he rubs his arm

JAKE
(leaning in)
Listen what Im about to tell you Im
telling you in confidence okay
(off Ashbys nod)
Have you ever heard of a company called
BigCom

ASHBY
BigCom That Internet thing

( )

JAKE
Right The guys who started that did
what a lot of companies in the Valley
do They get a good idea shop it
around raise some capital then sell
it off to a bigger company Microsoft
Intel Oracle whatever The beauty of
it is theyve pretty much sold the
company before theyre even real The
bigger company is already set to buy
it all they want to do is make sure
that the idea actually works So they
get some start up capital make it work
then sell it for like five times the
initial loan

ASHY
Sort of like a letter of intent

JAKE
Exactly But the Catch-22 is that you
cant tell anyone about the offer
because if its public you could start
a bidding war and thats considered a
breach of etiquette It could killa
deal But wait too long and youre
not considered hot anymore

ASHBY
And you have this letter of intent

JAKE
(quietly)
Yes Thats why I wish there were guys
willing to take a chance and live a
little

LILY
Were getting down to the wire
Apparently another company has a
similar product in RandD right now If
they beat us to it

JAKE

Not even the soft morning light can diffuse the reality
of this slum-pit studio apartment

Jake lies next to Lily kissing her neck A spoon
RATTLES in a glass from the growing RUMBLE of a passing
subway train The RUMBLE rises to an almost deafening
volume

Jakes a little alarmed Lily oblivious

Jake resumes kissing Lilys neck trying to rekindle some
of last nights magic

JAKE
Maybe Even if we dont youll be
alright Youre not in the hole with
the King

Lily rolls away from Jake Undaunted Jake starts kissing
her back

LILY

guy Real sweet Liked to talk We
used to get loaded on pills from the

Glenn about my boyfriend about how we
were thinking about doing it you know
I was thinking about letting him be my
first because I loved him

(pause)
What the hell was his name

JAKE
Glenn talked you out of it

LILY
Sort of I was telling him about this
great love of my life whos name I dont
remember and I could see He was
getting pissed I thought it was just
because he was worried about me but

( )

LILY (cont’d)
He told me that I was stupid because
my boyfriend didnt really love me

Jake grabs Lily and rolls her over onto her back
climbs on top of her

JAKE
He was looking out for you

LILY

Then he grabbed me and threw me down
on the floor that really cold
linoleum tiled hospital floor and
started ripping my uniform off

(pause)
He said he was going to fuck some
sense into me

Jake stops kissing Lily and looks up at her

LILY

Shit what was that guys name I really
liked him

JAKE

LILY
After Glenn was finished he gave me a
couple of valiums and I went home The
next day I finished my shift and met
him around back like we always did I
stuck a number eight scalpel into his
chest Three or four times

Jake slides off Lily

JAKE

LILY
I dont know I packed up my shit and
ran away To this So unlike you I

guess I do have something to prove in
a repressed anger sort of way

Jake considers for a second

JAKE
No You trusted him You were just
getting square

LILY
You know why I told you that Jake
(turning towards him)
Because I trust you too
