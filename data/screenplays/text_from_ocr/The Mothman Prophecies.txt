INTEXT CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT 28

John drives home lost in thought retracing the exact route
they drove on the night of the accident He passes the
CONSTRUCTION SITE the CLOCK TOWER the BIRD SANCTUARY

He drives slowly peering out the windshield looking for

something a reflection a tricky shadow - whatever it was
Mary saw that made her hit the brakes

28

As he rolls toward the exact spot he sees the LOW HANGING
TREE BRANCH stops the car gets out

EXT STREET - NIGHT 29
THICK BLACK SKID MARKS scar the street underneath the branch
John tries an experiment He gets in the car backs up forty

yards guns the accelerator Suddenly he slams the brakes
cranks the wheel The car slews sideways - he is pulled up

short by the seatbelt His face never even gets near the
window

He sits back Tugs on the shoulder harness It locks up So
why didn’t it lock up for Mary

He climbs out of the car searching the street - searching
for an answer a reason What did she see

John stands behind the BRANCH and squints his eyes the
branch BLURS and TWO DISTANT RED CONSTRUCTION LIGHTS shine
like EYES forming the impression of a large looming figure -
was that it

John walks to the front of the car That’s when he notices
something on the front bumper Something he missed completely
the night of the accident

The center of the bumper is scorched black

INT HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - NIGHT 30

CAMERA tracks along a chrome counter top past stacks of
plates cups of coffee

Temporal lobe tumor Very aggressive

ED (0S)

JOHN (0S)
According to Dr McElhone it’s very rare
Strikes one in 600000 Youve got a
better chance of catching the plague

CAMERA comes to rest behind John and Ed sitting at the
counter Now we can see their faces in A LARGE MIRROR behind

the pie rack John is gray with lock of sleep He forces out
the next words

30

JOHN (contd)
The doctor says with a tumor like this
most people never make full recoveries

ED
Is there anything else they can do

JOHN
They did surgery but couldn’t get it
all They’1l keep giving her chemo as
long as she’s strong enough So far it’s
working she’s looking a lot better her
spirits are high

ED
Did they say it’s a result of the
accident

JOHN

No turns outit’s been there a while

ED
John if there’s anything I can do

John just shakes his head Ed looks at his friend For the
first time John looks fragile truly lost

John stares into the middle-distance

JOHN
Three days ago we were house-hunting
Last week I was up all night worried that
I’d bounced the cable check It’s like
one day you’re driving in your car and
the universe just points at you and says
“Ah there you are The happy couple
I’ve been looking for you”

And he knows

INT HOSPITAL - MARY’S ROOM NIGHT 35

John slowly enters then pulls back a curtain his face full
of fear

Mary lies motionless on a bed

John moves slowly towards her his entire self somehow
diminished

He sits at her side and grips Mary’s hand like he’1l never
let her go His shoulders tremble with sharp inconsolable
sobs He leans in close and presses his lips to her white
lifeless face a kiss that will have to last him a lifetime

EXT HOSPITAL - LATER 36

Snow falls A SQUARE OF WARM YELLOW LIGHT glows in the night -
its the window to the waiting area From outside WE SEE

Ruth who can barely stand holding onto John She lets out a
silent wail of grief Woodrow watches them unable to
comprehend what has happened

Their images blur as we RACK FOCUS from the window moving
back through layers of FALLING SNOWFLAKES

DISSOLVE TO
INT MARY’S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING 37
The bed is empty John slowly packs Mary’s belongings into a
RED OVERNIGHT CASE He doesn’t know how to do this What
about the toothbrush The lipstick He picks up her dress
smells it His eyes close

ORDERLY (0S)
She knew

John opens his eyes puzzled A middle-aged ORDERLY stands in
the doorway The man smiles shyly at him

ORDERLY (CONTD)
She was drawing angels

John says nothing The man moves away But now John sees the
NOTEPAD next to the phone He reaches for it

John’s face darkens It’s not an angel
THE NOTEPAD a mad scribble of a figure its bulging eyes

colored red with Mary’s lipstick What is it John flips the
page There it is again and again page after page of Mary’s

37
obsessive drawings Aman-like shape with insect eyes and
giant wings growing from its back

EXT BENCH - LAFAYETTE PARK - DAY 38

The trees are leafless and the ground muddy Mittened
joggers dog walkers pass in front of a partial view of the
White House John is sitting on a bench with his back to us
He looks as though he’s been there a long time as though he
may sit there forever

The CAMERA begins to CLOSE IN on his back John senses
something He whips around and glares straight at us The
CAMERA STOPS SHORT John sees nothing his face relaxes

He turns forward again The CAMERA starts EASING toward him
again And very faintly now comes the hint of a RUSTLE
Wings Louder

John strains to hear He slowly scans left right Nothing
The CAMERA is right behind him now He can’t hear anything
Not even the sudden WHOOSH the single FLAP as the CAMERA
LIFTS OFF behind him rising leaving John down below
smaller smaller until he’s just another unremarkable human
dot in the park

We are watching a BANK OF TV MONITORS through the window of
an electronics store Christmas decorations light the
foreground

On it John Klein addresses Tim Russert on “Meet the Press
Under JOHN there is a super-title John Klein Washington
Post

WE MOVE IN through the windows towards the monitors and hear
John talking

JOHN
I think what we saw this year was an
apathetic electorate Interest in the
campaign was low and voter turn-out was
the worst in forty years

40

TIM RUSSERT
Couldn’t that just be a sign of voter
satisfaction People didn’t feel the need
for big changes

JOHN
I don’t think so Tim I think people are
-- very unsatisfied with their situation
And what made them so complacent is that
they didn’t see any viable options for
improvement Rather than endorse the
status quo they decided they’d rather
just stay home and be left alone

As the monitors play John’s interview MOVE INTO crackling
electric pixels and we

DISSOLVE TO

An awkward silence The Valet arrives with Gwen’s car She
looks at him expectantly

JOHN (CONTD)

John nods absently Gwen looks at him his thoughts are miles

empty suitcase from the top shelf sending clothes and books
cascading to the floor As he gathers them up he’s pulled up
short by the sight of Mary’s RED OVERNIGHT CASE It sits in
the corner where he left it almost a year ago

44

He bends to his knees moves his hand to the lock hesitates
afraid to unlock the past

Finally he lifts the 1 And there staring up at him isa

He looks around A dark empty road It doesn’t feel right
He glances in his mirror

HIS POV Nothing behind him Not another pair of headlights
Not even the interstate

John turns the key again Silence Not so much as the whine
of the starter He switches on the headlights Nothing He
punches up the radio dead So is the car phone John smacks
his palms on the wheel He takes out his cell phone It
beeps shuts down Drained

He looks at his watch 220 AM

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

Distant lightning flickers hypnotically It seems to be
moving from the ground up to the sky

JOHN mystified gets out of his car
EXT COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT 51

It’s a cold night and he tucks his hands under his arms He
should put on his coat

THE LIGHTNING flickers violently a few miles away But where
is the thunder It’s silent eerily silent so quiet John can
hear his heart beating

Abruptly the lightning is extinguished No stars No moon No
light at all

JOHN feels a surge of anxiety He’s alone at night in the
middle of nowhere

JOHN
(low whisper)
-Okay Okay

John shrugs on his overcoat and locks the car He looks up
and down the road Nothing He walks in darkness

Now he hears a strange low rumble What the hell is that The
sound vibrates the road below his feet

Finally he catches sight of a porch light on a distant
farmhouse Turning up his collar and plunging his hands in
his pockets John heads toward it at a fast clip

EXT FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 52

John bonds onto the porch The house is dark except for a
single 1b No use putting it off He knocks on the door
Waits Waits

A MAN opens the door John smiles

JOHN
Hi My car broke down just up the road
May I use your phone

The Man stares at him transfixed

MAN
It’s him
This response makes no sense to John A WOMAN steps into view
from the shadows behind the door she peers nervously at John
as the Man raises a gun
MAN (CONTD)
I‘ve been waiting for you you son of a
bitch

The Man grabs John by his lapels and hauls him inside The
door shuts hard

INT GORDON SMALLWOOD’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT 53
The Man GORDON SMALLWOOD holds his gun on

JOHN who stands dressed in his overcoat in the Smallwood’s
mildewy pink shower stall Gordon is sitting on the tank of
the toilet his feet on the closed lid He keeps the gun
steady with his elbows on his knees

JOHN
Look I don’t -

GORDON
Shut up

John shuts up The two men watch each other hearing the
tread of approaching footsteps

The Woman - Gordon’s wife DENISE SMALLWOOD enters

DENISE
Honey Connie’s here

John straightens slightly as

53

A WOMAN enters wearing a sheriffs deputy uniform under her
unzipped parka

She is SGT CONNIE PARKER - blond with keen blue eyes
and an honest face She calmly assesses the scene

John is enormously relieved

CONNIE
Okay Gordy why don’t you put away the
gun and tell me what’s going on

Gordon keeps the gun trained on John Connie places her hand
on the barrel and points it to the floor

GORDON
This is the third night in a row he’s
come around this sonofabitch is stalking
- us -

JOHN
- Look my car broke down up the road
my name is John Klein and I -

CONNIE
- Let’s let Gordy finish Mr Klein

Gordon speaks with a disturbing edge of fear in his voice

GORDON
Two nights ago at 230 there’s this
bang on the door I get up and here’s
this guy says he wants to use the phone
But there’s something creepy about him
right So I tell him to get lost No big
deal But last night at 230 on the dot
guess who’s back

CONNIE
Youre sure it was Mr Klein here

Gordon stares straight into John’s eyes

GORDON
Absolutely positive

JOHN
(under his breath)
This is crazy

Gordon has good ears

53 53

GORDON
(sternly)
I am not crazy

JOHN
I didn’t say -

Connie holds up a hand

CONNIE
(to Gordon)
So then what

GORDON
So last night I warned him off my
property I used the word “trespass”
Connie And he still came back
(to John)
I had the right to shoot you on my porch
You’re lucky I’m a Christian

CONNIE
He’d have actually had to be inside the
house Gordon

GORDON
Fine So tonight I figured maybe the dumb
fuck --
CONNIE
(sternly)
Gordon
GORDON

-- might come back again and sure
enough here he is

John turns to Sgt Parker taking pains to demonstrate that
he is the sanest person in the room

JOHN
Officer there must be some mistake I’ve
never been here before in my life I’ve
never seen these people I live in DC
Check my wallet

Connie calmly reaches into John’s pocket She pulls out his
wallet flips it open spots his press pass Her eyes jump to

INT MOTEL - NIGHT 59

The sleepy cranky NIGHT MANAGER runs John’s charge John
concentrates on the road map stretched out under the glass of
the check-in counter

His finger traces Washington to Richmond a straight shot of
interstate not more than 120 miles

THE NIGHT MANAGER returns with John’s credit card
JOHN
You think you could show me where we are
on the map

NIGHT MANAGER
We’re right on the state line

John traces to the VirginiaWest Virginia border The night
manager snorts with disgust Tourists Spare him

NIGHT MANAGER
With Ohio
He stabs a spot 400 miles away from John’s finger Point
Pleasant is on the Ohio River

John’s finger hesitantly tracks the tiny spidery lines from
Richmond to Point Pleasant There’s not even a primary road
between them The room key clinks down on the glass

JOHN keeps staring at the map It’s not possible

asleep in his clothes on top of the bedspread which he has
cocooned around himself He doesn’t know where he is for a
moment Then he HEARS it Faint BREATHING someone BREATHING
something BREATHING

He reaches for the bedside lamp and switches it on The
breathing stops Silent now Just a dull empty standard
issue motel room John swings his legs off the bed and leans
forward on his knees Bad dreams He stands up His cell
phone is recharging on the chair He heads for the bathroom
for a glass of water

INT MOTEL BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 62

onto a truck across the street

John tosses his weekender into the back seat and walks
quickly towards Gordon

Gordon eyes John warily arms folded across his chest

JOHN
(smoothly)
Mr Smallwood will you accept my
apology I’m afraid I might have been a
little rude last night

Gordon nods stoically

JOHN (cont‘d)
Listen youre sure it was me who came by

GORDON

Just your odd reports folks seeing

come to me

JOHN
I’ve had a few odd moments of my own
since last night If there’s other people
in town feeling as confused as I am right
now I’d sure like to know

There’s something in his voice or his face or maybe both

CONNIE
Okay In the last few months people have
come up to me and reported seeing strange
things And I’m not talking about the
town speed-freak I‘m talking about
honest hard-working church-going folks
I’ve known these people their whole
lives and they seem downright
embarrassed to be bringing it up

Bringing what up

It’s hard to explain

She tosses a sketch across the desk John picks it up

And almost passes out It’s a drawing of a man with huge bug-

eyesand giant wings in his back

back at-us mesmerized

LUCY (VO)
At first all I could see were these two
red eyes I kept on looking at it I
couldnt stop I’ve never had that
feeling before like I couldn’t move The
only way I can explain is that the whole
thing just wasn’t right I know that may
not make sense but that’s the only way I
can put it into words

80 BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT TIME LUCY’S BACKYARD) 80
CAMERA rises peering down at Lucy John Connie and Nat

Did you see it too

Nat shakes his head no

John’s eyes fix on something He walks over to the tree
reaches out his hand touches it He runs his fingers along
the tree bark - a large section is scorched black

The first one was just a loud beeping

Moise Now it’s mostly creaking howling
sounds - and once it was a man talking
really fast in some foreign language
Maybe Swedish or something like that

rumbles Flesh gropes The rumble slowly rises Suddenly

A SEARING RED LIGHT

from fifty yards away floods the back seat

cJs head pops up to look through the rear window The
light blinds him he covers his eyes

Oh shit it’s the cops

But it’s not a police car it’s a massive WALL OF SCORCHING
RED LIGHT hovering over the back window

CJ and Holly stare up terrified

Holly tries to shield her face with her HANDS and BLOUSE
That’s when she sees the Mothman her hands form trembling
wings red light pours through button holes forming two
demonic eyes

Oh my god Oh my god

Holly lets out a blood curdling scream

Suddenly A LOUD WHOOSH The light ascends into the night

The group has dwindled to to about ten people John and
Connie sit on a blanket Kevin is asleep at her side

Nat Griffin points his VIDEO CAMERA to the sky just above
the horizon

NAT
Look there they are

Suddenly excitement ripples through the remaining
spectators John and Connie stand up The camcorder lies
forgotten at John’s feet

RED AND BLUE PINPOINTS OF LIGHT hover in the sky Big deal
It could be an airplane

THE LIGHTS collapse in on each other and plummet straight
down into the river disappearing at the horizon where the
water meets the sky

More pairs of lights appear Now some of them spin around
each other and the after image looks like a DNA spiral
falling to the earth

John watches spellbound as the flickering lights spin and
fall The effect is hypnotic eerie dizzying
disorienting

John and Connie stare up at the lights like kids at a magic
show Then John realizes that he’s holding her hand They
glance at each other and John lets go embarrassed John’s
eyes shift down to

the red and blue lights reflecting off the water But for
a moment it almost seems as if the lights are coming from
the water -- and shining into the sky

John steals a glance back at Connie -- she’s still looking at
him And smiling

EXT ELECTRONICS STORE - DAY 96

Through a window decorated with Christmas lights we see a
bank of TV MONITORS -- similar to the storefront we saw
earlier when John was on CNN

INSIDE THE STORE 97
John is shopping for an answering machine

Suddenly a hand lands on John’s shoulder It’s Gordon
Smallwood -- and he looks scared

GORDON
Mr Klein -- I gotta talk to you

John backs up wary of the fear in Gordons face

GORDON (CONTD)

(Confidential)
Last night I woke up with the worst
headache I’ve ever had in my lifeSo I
go to the bathroom to get some aspirin
and I happen to look in the mirror -- and
I swear to God I see something I can’t
describe -- but sure as hell know it’s
not my reflection

John looks worried

GORDON (CONTD)
Then it goes away I can’t explain it
but I just keep staring telling this
thingto show up again But all I see
is me

Gordon looks around nervously making sure no one else can
hear this

GORDON (cont ‘d)
And then I hear this sound like a weird
howl coming out of the sink Then it’s a
voiceand it’s saying “Do not be
afraid Ninety-nine will die Denver
Nine” I even wrote it down

Gordon pulls a wrinkled piece of paper from his shirt pocket
and fiddles with it

GORDON (CONT’D)

It keeps saying the same thing over and
over for an hour Then it stops

Gordon peers at John feeling sure John must think he’s lost
his mind -- but John encourages him to go on

GORDON (CONT’D)
And when I look in the mirror I can’t
see anything Not even my own reflection
(pauses)
Then this morning when I woke up I
looked at the paper where I wrote down
the words and this was on it

He hands John the crumpled piece of paper Beneath the words
“Do not be afraid Ninety-nine will die Denver Nine” is a

sketch It’s crude but unmistakable A man with huge eves
a wings

JOHN
(pointing at sketch)
You don’t remember seeing this thing

GORDON
No and it scares the shit out of me

John stares at the page puzzled
JOHN
Denver nineDenver nineAny idea what
that means

Gordon shakes his head no As they head out of the store
John’s eyes narrow

John puts his hand on Gordons shoulder

Gordon brings his hand to his ear Blood is trickling along
his jaw from inside his ear Gordon gazes down at his hand
His stricken eyes dart to John

JOHN (CONTD)
--But this wasn’t just a message it was
a prediction that came true

CONNIE

Are these things Gordon’s having
hallucinations or dreams

108

JOHN
The way he describes them they sound
like dreams butI don’t know He
believes they’re real

CONNIE
I had a dream last night It felt real to
me
JOHN
Oh yeah

Connie’s face darkens just thinking about it scares her
He can see she wants to tell him He waits

CONNIE
It was nighttime and I was in the
middle of the ocean I was trying to
swim But I was too cold I looked for
something I could hold onto There were
Christmas presents floating all around
me wrapped up and tied with bows I
tried to grab them but they kept popping
away Like corks

John looks at Connie did Kevin hear all that She shrugs
then

John follows Kevin into the den

WE STAY ON CONNIE She watches them getting along like John’s
been around forever A lot of strange things have turned up
in Point Pleasant recently On Connie’s face we can see that
not all of them are bad

he hasn’t been in a church in years As they move away from
the others they notice DENISE standing nervously at the
bottom of the steps

CONNIE
Denise

DENISE
I don’t mean to bother you Connie but
it’s Gordon

As she steps closer to Connie she can see that Denise has
been crying

CONNIE
Are you okay

Denise avoids her eyes carefully phrasing her next remark

DENISE
I don’t understand what’s happening to
him If word gets out that Gordon’s you
know “hearing voices”I need someone

scares John most of all

INT JOHNS MOTEL ROOM - TWO NIGHTS LATER 118

Since we last saw it the tiny motel room has been
transformed into

crowd the small desk Newspapers books and faxes are stacked
everywhere

Maps cover the walls studded with colored tacks Red ones
for odd light events blue ones for giant bird-creature
sightings etc In the middle of the chaos

of Merlot watching

hear Josh’s VOICE as he answers his phone

Hello

On the other end of the line we hear an ungodly racket a
creaki j anmo followed mechanical shriek

Connie shakes her head in wonder

CONNIE
This is definitely the weirdest date I’ve
ever been on

JOHN
Is this a date

CONNIE
Cut me some slack It’s after eleven on a
weeknight and I’m in a motel room with a
single man I’m calling it a date

John gives her a curious smile slightly lowering the volume
on the shrieking wail

JOHN
I think it actually sounds sort of
beautiful if you play it low Kind of
like a mating call

CONNIE
Yeah I see what you mean maybe this
could be our song

John smiles An awkward silence He leans in and gently
kisses her She kisses him back

They pull back both a little surprised at what’s just
happened Johns face makes it clear -- this is the first
woman he’s kissed since Mary died

Connie breaks the awkward silence

CONNIE (cont’d)
Look if this is too soon we could --

But before she can even finish

he sounds stressed

The mood in the room has completely shifted

JOHN
Let me talk to him

GORDON 0S)
Sure Hang on

Then he turns to Connie and covers the mouthpiece
JOHN
Get over to Gordon’s quick he says
Indrid Cold is there

Connie doesn’t ask questions she just grabs her things and
heads for the door

A thin monotone VOICE -- supposedly that of Indrid Cold --
comes on the line

VOICE (0S)
Hello John Klein

John tries to collect his thoughts

JOHN
Who is this

VOICE (0S)
My name is Indrid Cold 119

John quickly attaches his tape recorder -- an expensive
digital device -- to his phone

JOHN
Unless of course you’re Gordon
Smallwood

INDRID COLD (0S)
Your father was born in Racine
Wisconsin You lived in a green house on
Monroe street You can’t remember how

John realizes he’s sweating his breathing has quickened He
makes himself breathe normally

JOHN
Okay youve got my attention What color

INDRID COLD(OS)
Red shirt three buttons

Correct Hmm John looks around the room The curtains are
open He pulls them shut He looks down and sees his watch in
his shoe

JOHN
Where’s my watch

INDRID COLD(OS)
Shoe under bed

He looks around the room Hidden cameras An elaborate trick
He shuts off all the lights Then plunges his hand into his
overnight bag

JOHN
What am I holding in my hand

INDRID COLD(OS)
Cream stick

John pulls his hand from his bag he holds a small tube of
Chapstick Suddenly an explanation occurs

JOHN
(smiling)
Indrid Cold -- are you reading my mind

INDRID COLD(OS)
I have no need to

but doesn’t open it The real test

The line ERUPTS IN A HIGH PITCHED WHINE a metallic WHISTLE
piercing John’s ear He flings the phone away The receiver

SCREECH becomes a terrible CREAK replaced by STATIC then
nothing finally a dial tone John forces himself to retrieve
the receiver and place it back on the cradle Sweat beads

roll down into his eyes

John sits in the SOUND LAB surrounded by some of the most
sophisticated sound analysis equipment in America He listens
to a tape of last night’s phone call along with

SONNY BERGER a sound engineer -- good-natured bearded
and at least 300 pounds

As Indrid Cold’s VOICE comes on Sonny points to the Voice
Frequency Gauge
SONNY
See It’s sticking up here around 1950
cycles per second The lowest it gets is
maybe 1930 or so
Then John’s VOICE comes on the tape
SONNY (cont’d)
Yours is way down here in normal vocal
range anywhere from 1000 to 1200 cycles
per second
JOHN
So this guy’s vocal range is higher than
mine
SONNY
(laughs) )
You‘re bullshitting me right How’d you
do it
JOHN
Do what
SONNY
Create the voice It’s a good mimic but
comes on 1900 cycles per second
Groundhogs don’t go that high
JOHN
So what the hell is it
As the tape plays Sonny isolates Indrid Cold’s voice and
does a computer search for matchesNothing
SONNY
As near as I can figure it’s some sort
of electrical impulse But whatever it
is it isn’t coming out of human vocal
cords

He looks around terrified what’s happening to him

Sweat beads on his forehead he tries to move his arms his
hands his legs -- he’s paralyzed with fear

The car continues to roll forward increasing speed Ten
FeetTwentyThirty His fear escalates into panic Every
yard an eternity of unbearable terror At fifty feet he

crosses an invisible border his fear leaves as suddenly as
it came

John stops the car He catches his breath gathering his
nerve to investigate further

EXT UNFINISHED HIGHWAYSCRAP YARD - CONTINUOUS 137

ohn climbs ovt of his car plants his feet on the asphalt
looks around

Nothing out of the ordinary No sign of Indrid Cold or any
other explanation -- what did he just pass through

He walks back towards the area slowly cautiously trying to
stay calm

Then he takes one step too many

Hes back inside the zone The air becomes perfectly still as
ALL AUDIBLE SOUNDS -- animals birds even insects -- are
sucked into silence The night becomes darker too dark

John’s breathing becomes shallow and fast He falls to the
ground engulfed in fear

I couldn’t move I don’t know what it
was I was more afraid than Ive ever
been in my whole life I was just a few
feet from where I came in but it felt
like Id never make it back

No
OKSTER
Did you have a guardian angel or secret
friend

Dr Okster shows John and Gordon their EEG printouts

OKSTER
Alright this line here It measures
activity in the temporal lobe the visual
and perceptual center of the brain
Disorders in this area have been linked
to both alien encounters and near-death
experiences

JOHN
Disorders like a brain tumor

OKSTER
Maybe But neither you nor Mr Smallwood
seem to have any temporal lobe
abnormalities

JOHN
So what does that leave

OKSTER
You might have been exposed to an
electromagnetic field Certain people are
more sensitive than others to these EM
waves and it stimulates their temporal
lobes causing vivid hallucinations

Gordon squints skeptically

142

OKSTER (cont’d)
Bright lights voices feelings of
terror distortions of time and even
sightings of humanoid creatures

Gordon looks freaked John doesn’t know what to think

A MAN emerges from the apartment building stocky red face
and crew-cut hair Looks like a retired drill sergeant

John glances at the author photo on the book he holds

‘Things Unseen” Sure enough it’s the same guy ALBERT LEEK

John dodges across the street and stops him

JOHN
Mr Leek

Leek stops in his tracks alarmed John holds up one of the
Bird-Man sketches

JOHN (contd)
Do you know what this is

Leek’s eyes flick from the sketch to John’s face

LEEK
Who the hell are you

JOHN
John Klein I called you I need to know
about this

Leek stares at him considers -- then pushes quickly past

LEEK
Im sorry but I’m already late

John follows after him down the crowded street

JOHN
Have you ever seen this thing

Leek keeps walking trying to ignore the man following him
JOHN (contd)
(shouting over street noise)
I need your help Mr Leek
Leek finally stops and turns -- John almost runs into him

LEEK
Where are they seeing him

JOHN
(out of breath)
Point Pleasant West Virginia
He stares at John making up his mind should he bother

Leek grabs the sketch from John and gazes at it He looks
like he’s staring at his own obituary 144

John’s eyes go wide

JOHN
(a statement)
You can help me can’t you

Leek nods

LEEK
Follow me

INT METROPOLIS BOOK SHOP - DAY 145

John follows Leek into the giant dusty old bookstore
Shelves tower overhead stacks of books line the floor
aisles roll out in all directions disappearing into murky
darkness

ANGLE ON AISLE John watches Leek scan the titles his head
tilted to the side He plucks a book off the shelves

LEEK
Ah here we are

Leek flips through a book and stops on A PAINTING OF A GIANT
MAN WITH WINGS It looks like something out of Greek
mythology John shudders

JOHN
Mothman

LEEK
That’s what the Ukrainians called him
Rough translation of course There were
a hundred sightings in Chernobyl the year
the nuclear plant went down

JOHN
Jesus

Leek turns to A GRAINY PHOTOGRAPH the kind weve all seen
blurry poorly framed -- but instead of a UFO a Moth-like
figure hovers in the sky

LEEK

hurricane They saw it But seeing isn’t
always believing There’s never been a
single shred of evidence that any of
(MORE)

LEEK (contd)
these things exist materially not for
more than a short time anyway No one’s
ever seen any Bigfoot bodes or crashed
UFOS

JOHN
What about Roswell

LEEK
Come on You work in Washington Is that
braintrust capable of keeping that kind
of secret

John rubs his eyes confused

JOHN
So youre saying these things don’t
exist

LEEK
Sure they exist There’s all kinds of
things that exist all around us that we
never see right Electricity
microwaves infra-red waves You know
they’ve been around forever they show up
in cave paintings They’re a normal
condition of the planet they’re just not
part of our consensus of what constitutes
physical reality

JOHN
(frustrated)
But what are they

LEEK
Look you’re asking for an explanation
for something that cant be explained
rationally

JOHN
But why do they show-up before all these
disasters

Leek re-shelves the book turns to John

LEEK
You know all that build-up of energy
before something happens The way your
hair stands up before lightning strikes
Thats when they cross over --

JOHN
-- What do you mean before something
happens Do they cause disasters

TA 145

LEEK
Why would they need to No my theory is
they foreshadow death and disaster

John lets that sink in then

JOHN
What do they want

LEEK
I have no idea What you really want to
know is why you

JOHN
Okay Yeah

LEEK
You think you’re special Trust me
you’re not You just got in their way

JOHN
Got in their way

LEEK
You noticed them And they noticed that
you noticed them Most people aren’t
sensitive enough to see them without some
sort of trauma

John winces Leek studies him leans in

LEEK (cont‘d)
Are you fixated on death Mr Klein

John is silent Leek nods knowingly then walks down the
aisle and out the door John follows

EXT NEW YORK STREET DUSK 146

Loud crowded and cold John and Leek walk into the wind

Last week my friend got a strange phone
call from a spirit or entity or whatever

It seemed to know everything Like
God

LEEK
(continuing for him)

And t made predictions and they came
true

146

JOHN
(nods excited)
Yeah He called himself Indrid Cold

John searches Leek’s face for a sign of recognition Leek
just shrugs The name means nothing to him

LEEK
If your “friend” thinks he’s talking to
God he’s off by more than a few degrees

JOHN
But how could he know all this stuff

Leek stops walking He looks around trying to figure out a
way to explain

LEEK
Look up there

John looks where Leek is pointing

A SKYSCRAPER Ten stories up a window-washer squeegees the
side of a glass building

LEEK (CONTD)
If there was a car crash on Eighty Fourth
and Riverside that window washer up there
could probably see it Doesn’t mean he’s
God -- or even any smarter than we are
But from where he’s sitting he can see a
little further down the road

JOHN
But they’ve gotta be more advanced then
us Why don’t they just come right out
and say what’s on their minds

Leek nods
LEEK
You’re more advanced than a cockroach --
ever try explaining yourself to one

They continue down the street each lost in their own
thoughts John breaks the silence

JOHN
So what about Point Pleasant

LEEK
How many people have seen it

146 146

JOHN
I don’t know ten maybe twenty

Leek stops dead in his tracks looks John in the eyes

LEEK
Don’t go back there
Mr Klein
JOHN
What

LEEK

Listen to me something terrible is going
to happen in Point Pleasant

John is struck by the sudden fear that has clouded Leek’s
face

LEEK (cont’d)
Nothing you do can stop it Don’t go
back stay away and stay away from
meI can’t talk about this any more

Leek starts to walk away but John’s desperation demands an
answer He pulls Leek violently by the arn

JOHN
Look Mr Leek there’s got to be a
reason I ended up in Point Pleasant
something brought me there

Leek pulls away

LEEK

If it brought you there it brought you
there to die

LEEK disappears down a dark staircase to the subway

147 EXT NEW YORK STREETS - NIGHT 147

John has put off his flight and spends hours walking circles
around Times Square wrestling with unanswered questions

148 EXT NEW YORK STREET - MORNING 148

Leek’s brownstone When someone leaves he rushes to the door
before it locks slips in the building

INT LEEK’S APT BUILDING - HALLW2ZVY - MORNING 149
John knocks Leek cracks the doc open displeased

JOHN
Please I need to talk to you

Leek stares coldly

JCN (cont’d)
I need to know what happened to you

Leeks face darkens clouded by a bad memory He lets the
door swing open

INT LEEK’S APARTMENT - MORNING 149A

John follows him down a long hallway into the KITCHEN

LEEK

You didn’t sleep last night did you
JOHN

No
LEEK

Once they get to you it’s hard to sleep
isn’t it

John nods

LEEK (cont’d)
You cross a line between whats real and
what’s not real

Leek pours himself a cup of tea and sits down at a table
across from John

LEEK (cont’d)
I was a physics professor at Cornell
tenured you can look me up One day I
started hearing voices The voices became
messages Before long I was fully
convinced that I was receiving
predictions of disaster from “outside
intelligences”

JOHN
But you were werent you

LEEK (contd)
going to blow up I tried to prevent it
but no one listened

JOHN
What happened

Leek has turned fragile shaking his head slowly as if
reliving the past

LEEK
People died

Leek finishes his tea and goes into the LIVING ROOM John
follows

LEEK (cont’d)
I was investigated and almost arrested
My wife divorced me and my kids stopped
speaking to me I spent four horrific
years in a psychiatric facility I lost
everything

JOHN
Oh my god

Leek has moved over to a mantle in front of a fireplace
Pictures of his past life loom behind him

LEEK
Being right is worse than being wrong If
you’re wrong you’re just a fool if
you’re right you’re a suspect
Basically it’s a lose lose situation

Leek walks towards John stands very close to him John looks
lost and exhausted

LEEK (cont’d)
They fuck with guys like us Mr Klein
Youll never understand their messages
Youll misinterpret themI did It
almost destroyed me
You know what In the end it all came
down to one simple question which was
more important - having proof Or having
a life

John tries hard to pull himself together

JOHN
I’m scared

149A 149A

LEEK
Good when you stop being scared -- then
it’s time to worry Trust me I turned
away years ago when I pitched all my
notes into that fireplace and I’ve never
looked back

JOHN
But didn’t you want to know

LEEK
Know what

JOHN
The answers

Leek shakes his head recognizing the persistence of the
truth seeker in front of him Leek extends his hand

LEEK
Good luck John

brought here For a reason

Connie stops looks him in the eyes
JOHN (cont ‘d)
These things are real Indrid Cold is
real He’s trying to show me something

John waits for her to react All he sees on her face is
concern Whatever she’s thinking she doesn’t want to say it

Fifty feet above them the grand old pine tree lights They
stare speechless It’s beautiful but at the same time

maybe because of the events of the last months a pall hangs
over the town

the town square turning around as he walks his eyes
everywhere scanning in all directions

Connie struggles to keep up with him

CONNIE
All these strange questions What are you

good
JOHN
What did you say
CONNIE
I asked for some ID -- will you slow

down please

164 164

JOHN
Did she give you any

CONNIE
No She just said “Tell John I’m sorry
for ruining everything” And then she got
up and walked out

John stops in his tracks and whips around staring at Connie

CONNIE (CONTD)
Whats wrong

For a moment John can’t speak Then he claws his wallet out
of his coat flips it open and thrusts it at Connie

JOHN
Was it her

Connie focuses on a wallet-size snapshot of Mary Klein -- and
her eyes go wide in shock This is the woman

JOHN (CONTD)
Was it her

CONNIE
(barely audible)
Thats your wife
JOHN
(on fire)
It was her
Connie slowly shakes her head This is impossible

And just that fast doubt forms in her eyes

CONNIE
I’m not sure
JOHN
What
CONNIE
I mean -- the hair is different and

John stares at her in disbelief she’s convincing herself
that it wasn’t Mary she saw

JOHN
Oh come on

CONNIE
(defensive)
What
JOHN

You saw her This is the woman you saw

The crazed look on John’s face scares the hell out of her
There’s no way she’s buying into all this

CONNIE
No it isn’t John I agree there is
aa Similarity maybe but --

JOHN
Bullshit

This hits Connie like a slap in the face She struggles to
maintain her calm

then plays it through three or four times listening closely
for words voices -- anything

Nothing Just the odd murmuring noise

John comes to a decision there’s only one thing to do

John opens a box of 40-gallon trash bags He shakes one open
and slowly begins stuffing it

He starts with the photos next go the note cards Then the
maps and charts He begins moving faster and faster

He furiously jams faxes and articles into the bag Finally

Finally it seems like it might be okay He stares at this
island of normalcy in a room packed with madness

John grabs her enraged

JOHN
Fuck Gordon Im not Gordon That wasn’t

CONNIE
It leaves Dulles for Columbus Ohio at

Despite everything John is actually touched

CONNIE (CONTD)
It’s Christmas Eve John I miss you
Kevin does too

JOHN
I can’t

CONNIE
The hell you can’t

John’s voice is choked with emotion

JOHN
ConnieWhen Mary got sickI kept
wishing there was something I could do to
stop it Anything But there wasn’t It
was like there was this train coming
straight for me and I could see it but no
matter what I did I couldn’t get out of
its wayI couldn’t stop it

CONNIE
No one can stop it John Look planes are
going to crash Earthquakes are going to
happen People you know and love are
going to die and no matter what that
fucking alien tells you there’s nothing
you can do about it You can’t save the
world John All you can do is try to
survive it

Tears run down John’s face He forces out the words
JOHN
It’s one year to the day He told me she
was going to call He said Mary was going
to call with the message

A long beat of silence 200

CONNIE
(gently)
He‘s lying John Whoever calls might
sound like her but it’s not going to be
her I don’t know what happens after we
die but I’1ll bet wherever Mary is now
she’s nowhere near Indrid Cold

John cries openly now emotion and fear shaking him

JOHN
But what if it is her
(almost a whisper)
I never even got to say goodbye

CONNIE
(gently)
She’s dead John

A long silence as this reality finally sinks in for John --
maybe for the first time ever

CONNIE (cont’d)
(contd)
The only question now is how you want to
remember her

John looks at the crumpled Polaroid Just the three of them
John Mary -- and Mothman

JOHN
I miss her so much

CONNIE
I know you do You can miss her here just
as easily as there Maybe more easily
cause youre all alone there and that’s
no way to be

Another silence Then

JOHN
I miss you too

CONNIE
(kindly)
Do whatever you have to do I’ll
understand But down here we have dinner
at six and do presents at eight We’ll be
waiting for you

And with that Connie hangs up John slowly sets down the
phone It’s 1159 AM

He looks at his bags still packed lying in the entry hall
where he dumped them three days ago

John looks back at the phone The futureOr the past The
livingOr the dead He moves for the phone - then reaches
past it and grabs

THE WALL CORD He holds it gathers his courageAnd though
it might be the most painful thing he’s ever done he takes a
deep breath stands up

And yanks the phone cord out of the wal

Done He pants a bit from the emotional effort Maybe it
wasn’t so hard after all

He opens the blinds Light fills his apartment He looks
around For the first time in days -- maybe for the first
time in over a year -- John Klein feels truly free

His eyes land on the bags in the entry hall John goes to
them grabs them up and heads for the door

THE PHONE RINGS

John freezes He turns and looks at the phone The frayed
wall cord lies coiled like a snake on the floor

THE PHONE RINGS
He looks at the clock It’s 1200 exactly
THE PHONE RINGS

John turns away He grips the door knob turns it and opens
the door

John steps out into the hall And closes the door behind him

Connie stands on tip-toes looking down the long line of cars
to see what the hold up is Far ahead down at the Point
Pleasant end of the bridge she sees

registers the Ford Escort waiting there on the road leading

static fogs the radio He shuts it off annoyed

And in the sudden silence he hears it A SOUND A faint
sound A familiar sound

Connie stands in the cold wind -- and hears the sound too A
low MOAN that rises to an eerie SHRIEK

She looks around -- where the hell is that sound coming from

Lucy Griffin and her son Nat hear it

Denise Smallwood hears it

And a dozen other people we recognize from town -- they all
hear the ominous sounds

Twenty yards ahead A MAN is standing beside his car

JOHN
What’s going on up there

MAN
Some problem with the traffic lights

John walks away The CAMERA begins to CLOSE IN on his back
John stops sensing something The CAMERA stops

John whips around looks directly at us The CAMERA retreats

Moaning howling shriekingThat’s when John realizes
It’s the sound from Josh Jessup’s phone calls

picture of abject horror

alive -- with wings and two glowing red eyes

Is it Mothman Just when the image seems to firm up a blast
of snow obscures it The shadowy figure seems to tilt it’s
head back and we hear a HOWLING SHRIFK

John hears the SNAP He looks up at the exact spot where CJ
sees the creature And this time he does see something

BRIDGE SUPERSTRUCTURE 232
A FORMLESS GRAY MASS streaking toward him from the fog

It coalesces before John’s eyes revealing itself as

lightning just inches in front of John’s face and smashes
through

relief that the incredibly fine line between miracle and
disaster in their lives didn’t get crossed

Connie looks out across the devastated landscape they are
surrounded by close to ahundred survivors wrapped in
blankets some already bandaged others being tended to

We recognize many who escaped tragedy thanks to John’s
warnings

She reaches out a hand John takes it Then he puts an arm
around both her and Kevin

both knowing the answer
