OVER BLACK
A sweet young woman’s voice narrates

SORTILEGE (VO)
She came along the alley and up
the back stairs the way she always
used to Doc hadn’t seen her for
over a year Nobody had Back
then it was always sandals bottom
half of a flower print bikini
faded Country Joe and the Fish T-
shirt Tonight she was all in
flatland gear hair a lot shorter
than he remembered looking just
like she swore she’d never look

FADE IN
INT DOC’S APARTMENT (GORDITA BEACH) - DUSK DOC SPORTELLO sits half awake on his couch He looks up

notices someone standing at his door SHASTA FAY
HEPWORTH (20s)

DOC
Is that you Shasta
SHASTA
Think you’re hallucinating
DOC
No just the new package I
guess
SHASTA
I need your help Doc
DOC
Come in ( you know I have an

office now and everything Just
like a day job)

She walks in Doc gets a slow rising BONER in his
pants casually tries to cover it up

SHASTA
I looked in the phone book and
almost went over there but then I
thought better for everyone if
this looked like a secret
rendezvous

DOC
Somebody keeping a close eye
SHASTA
- I just spent an hour on
surface streets trying to make it
look good

DOC
How about a beer

Doc moves to the fridge Shasta looks around they sit
down at the kitchen table

SHASTA
So there’s this guy

DOC
Gentlemen of the straightworld
persuasion

SHASTA
Okay Doc He’s married

DOC
And the wife -- she knows about
you

SHASTA
But she’s seeing somebody too
Only it’s not just the usual -- I

think they’re working on some
creepy little scheme

DOC

To make off with the hubby’s
fortune I think I’ve heard this
one once or twice

SHASTA

They want me in on it they
think I’m the one who can reach
him when he’s vulnerable or as
much as he ever gets

DOC
Bare-ass and asleep

SHASTA
I knew you’d understand

DOC
Are you still trying to figure out
if it’s right or wrong

SHASTA
Worse than that How much loyalty
I owe him
BEAT

DOC
I hope you’re not asking me
Beyond the usual boilerplate
people owe anybody they’re fucking
steady

SHASTA
Dear Abby said the same thing

DOC
Emotions aside let’s look at the
money How much of the rent’s he
been picking up

SHASTA
All of it

DOC
Pretty hefty

SHASTA

For Hancock Park

DOC
Youre giving him I0Us for
everything of course

SHASTA

professional How much are the
wifey and boyfriend offering to
cut you in for

DOC
So this this isn’t just a
couple of X-rated Polaroids then
Dope planted in the glove
compartment nothin’ like that

SHASTA
It isn’t what you’re thinking
Doc

DOC
Don’t worry thinking comes later

SHASTA

I’m not sure but it sounds like
they want to commit him to some
kind of loony bin

DOC
You mean legally Or a snatch of
some kind
SHASTA
Nobody’s telling me Doc I’m just
the bait
CLOSEUP - SHASTA’S FACE

EXT DOC’S - STREET - EVENING

He walks her down to her car ‘59 CADILLAC EL DORADO

SHASTA

She backs away gets in the CADILLAC and drives off into
the night MUSIC STARTS He watches her go HOLD WITH
DOC DENIS (rhymes with penis) walks up says hi they
walk up towards town away from the beach

DOC
Hey Denis you hungry
DENIS
Like Godzilla sez to Mothra man
‘let’s go eat someplace’

SORTILEGE (VO)
When Doc came in that night it
wasn’t just the usual hungry-doper
thing -- it was something else --
and with Neptune moving at last
out of the Scorpio death-trip and
rising into the Sagitarrian light
of the higher mind -- it was bound
to be something love-related and I
thought I knew what it was

CUT TO

INT PIPELINE PIZZA - NIGHT

DOC and DENIS and a bunch of locals eating pizza
Sitting here are some SURFERS a friend named ENSENADA
SLIM and a lovely young girl our narrator SORTILEGE
(20s) she speaks in the flesh

SORTILEGE
Was that Shasta’s car I saw down
the drive

DOC
She stuck her head in for a couple
minutes

SORTILEGE
Are you broken up

DOC
Kind of weird seeing her again
Figured next time I did it’d be on
the tube not in person

SORTILEGE looks at DOC with sweetness then at HIS HAIR

SORTILEGE

Better do something about that
DOC

Again
SORTILEGE

I can’t say it enough -- change

your hair change your life

DOC
What do you recommend

SORTILEGE
That’s up to you Follow your
intuition
(ETC -- Pizza talk here)

CUT TO

INT DOC’S APARTMENT

He sits on his couch THE MUSIC PLAYS He’s on the
hone it’s ringing to no answer His hair is rolled
into plantation-style knots He’s rolling a joint

SORTILEGE (VO)
There was an ancient superstition
at the beach something like the
surfer belief that burning your
board will bring awesome waves
and it went like this Take a Zig-
Zag paper and write your dearest
wish and then use it to rolla
joint of the best dope you can
find and smoke it all up and your
wish would be granted Doc’s wish
was simple (just that Shasta
Fay be safe)

He writes on the rolling papers a small note in pencil
“To Shasta’s Safety With Love Doc” Smokes it and
calls his AUNT REET (50s) who lives down the street --

INTERCUT WITH

INT AUNT REET’S HOUSE

She’s applying ten tons of various makeups spraying some
on applying with ten gallon brushes and dipping her face
into other paints

AUNT REET
Make it quick Larry I’ve got a
live one tonight and a quarter ton
of makeup to put on yet --

DOC
Okay Mickey Wolfmann what can
you tell me

AUNT REET
Powerhouse in LA real estate
from the desert to the sea --
Technically Jewish but wants to be

a Nazi -- what’s he to you
DOC
Shasta she came around told

me about a possible plot to snatch
up Wolfmann by his wife and her
boyfriend
AUNT REET
And what is Shastas role in all
this

DOC
Like how passionately does she
feel about her flame Mickey I
didn’t ask ‘I love him’ is
probably the answer what else

AUNT REET
Is she paying you

DOC
Mmm

AUNT REET

Pause Silence Big surprise
Listen if Shasta can’t pay you
maybe that means Mickey dumped her
and she’s blaming the wife and
wants revenge

DOC
Possible But say I just wanted
to hang out and rap with this
Wolfmann

AUNT REET
I wouldn’t recommend your usual
approach he goes around with a
dozen bikers mostly Aryan
Brotherhood alumni -- all court
certified bad-asses

DOC

Wait wait wait I flunked social
studies Jews and Aryan
Brotherhood Isn’t there
something about hatred

AUNT REET

Mickey’s eccentric More and more
lately I would say stoned out of
his fuckin’ mind since he
discovered drugs no offense to
you Doc

DOC
So where would I find him
accidentally

AUNT REET

I promised my little sister that
Id never put her baby in the way
of danger

5A

DOC
I’m cool with the Brotherhood
Aunt Reet I know their secret
handshake and everything

AUNT REET
It’s your ass -- try the Channel
View Estates his latest insult to
the environment

DOC
Channel View Estates The one
Bigfoot Bjornsen does the
commercials for

AUNT REET
That’s the one Maybe your old
cop buddy’s the one who should be
taking care of your case

DOC
I did think of going to Bigfoot
but just as I reached for the
phone history and all I thought
‘naaahhhhh’

AUNT REET
Maybe you’re better off with the
Nazis Call your mother once ina
while so she knows you’re alive

Doc gets up and walks to the TV switches the channel
finds

INSERT - ON TELEVISION

The commercial for “Channel View Estates” comes on after
a bad horror movie It has LT BIGFOOT BJORNSEN dressed
as a “hippie” He’s wearing an ankle-length velvet cape
in paisley love beads shades with peace symbols and an
Afro wig He’s like Cal Worthington except for live
animals he has a pack of SCREAMING KIDS that do
cannonballs in the pool of a MODEL HOME that Bigfoot’s
showing off and listing details and financing options

bullhorn Doc steps out guns aim at him A DEAD BODY
ON THE GROUND BETWEEN HIM AND THE LAPD

BIGFOOT
Congratulations hippie scum And
welcome to a world of
inconvenience Yes this time it
appears you have finally managed
to stumble into something too real
and deep to hallucinate your
worthless hippie ass of -- without
wishing to seem impatient --
anytime youd like to join us
wed so like to chat

DOC
Bigfoot what happened I
remember massage parlor -- Asian
chick named Jade and Anglo friend
Bambi --

BIGFOOT

Wishful figments of a brain
pickled in cannabis fumes no
doubt

DOC
Whatever it is I didnt do it
BIGFOOT
Sure

12 ANGLE - LATER

Doc is in cuffs sitting on the ground THERES A CORPSE
COVERED ON A GURNEY that is taken past It is a bloody
mess body parts are falling out onto the ground -- Doc

is getting sick at the sight of it

BIGFOOT
I can almost pity your civilian

distress Though if you were more

of a man and less of a ball-less
hippie draft dodger who knows

you might have seen enough over in

the Nam to share even my own

sense of professional ennui at the

sight of one more stiff

DOC
Who is it

BIGFOOT

Was Sportello Here on Earth we

say ‘was’ Meet Glen Charlock
Whom you were asking for by name
only hours ago witnesses will
swear to that Furthermore on
the face of it youve chosen to
ice a personal bodyguard of

the rather well-connected Mickey

Wolfmann Name rings bell Or in
your case shakes tambourine Ah

but heres our ride --

A POLICE CRUISER COMES TO A SLIDING STOP NEXT TO DOC AND

BIGFOOT
DOC
Wheres my ride
BIGFOOT
Like its owner on its way to
impoundment
13 INT PARKER CENTER - DAY

Doc in custody sitting across from Bigfoot

BIGFOOT
So when you and Glen had your
fatal encounter when would you
say that was in the series of
events

CUT TO

DOC
I told you the first time I ever
saw him he was dead

BIGFOOT
His associates then How many of
them were you already acquainted
with

DOC
Not normally guys Id hang out
with Bigfoot totally wrong drug
profile

BIGFOOT
Potheads youre so exclusive
Would you say you took offense at
Glens preference for barbiturates
and amphetamines

DOC
Yes I was planning to report him
to the Dope Fiend Standards and
Ethics Committee next week

BIGFOOT
Now your ex-girlfriend Shasta Fay
Hepworth is a known intimate of
Glens employer Mickey Wolfmann
Do you think Glen and Shasta were --

Bigfoot slides his fingers around makes a fucking
sign

BIGFOOT
How does it make you feel Here
you are still carrying the torch
and there she is in the company of
all those Nazi lowlifes

DOC
Keep doing that Bigfoot youre
givin me a hard-on

BIGFOOT
Tough little wop monkey as my man
Fatso Judson always sez

DOC
Case you forget Lieutenant you
and me are almost in the same
business except I dont get that
free pass to shoot people all the
time and so forth But if I was
in your seat I guess Id be
acting the same way maybe start
in next with remarks about my
mother

(MORE)
DOC (CONTD)
Or I guess your mother because
youd be me Have I got that
right

Bigfoot pretends to read notes

BIGFOOT
While suspect -- thats you -- is
having alleged midday nap so
necessary to the hippie lifestyle
some sort of incident occurs in
the vicinity of Channel View
Estates Firearms are discharged
When the dust settles we find one
Glen Charlock deceased More
compellingly for LAPD the man
Charlock was supposed to be
guarding Michael Z Wolfmann has
vanished giving local law
enforcement less than 24 hours
before the feds call it a
kidnapping and come in to fuck
everything up Perhaps
Sportello you could help
forestall this by providing the
names of the other members of your
cult

DOC
Cult

BIGFOOT
No one would ever be stupid enough
to attempt this alone which
suggests some kind of Mansanoid
conspiracy wouldnt you agree
Ive been referred to more than
once by the LA Times as a
Renaissance detective which means
that I am many things--
and one thing I am not is stupid --
and purely out of noblesse oblige
I extend this assumotion to cover
you as well

Enter DOCS LAWYER SAUNCHO SMILAX (30s)

SAUNCHO
Lieutenant You know that you
dont have any case here so if
youre going to charge him
you better otherwise --

DOC
Sauncho remember who this is
youre talking to its Bigfoot
Bjornsen renaissance cop

SAUNCHO
Charge him or let him go you have
no case

DOC
Bigfoot dont mind him he
watches too many courtroom dramas

BEAT They all look at each other

SAUNCHO
Whats the beef here exactly

BIGFOOT
It doesnt have much to do with
your speciality which I
understand is marine law

SAUNCHO
Theres plenty of crime on the
high seas

BIGFOOT
So far we have murder and
kidnapping we can work in pirates
if that would make you more
comfortable -- either way its
high profile

SAUNCHO
Yes but given your history with
my client -- you know this is

harassment theres no case
thisll never make it to trial

BIGFOOT
We probably could take this all
the way to trial -- but with our

luck the jury pool will be 99
percent hippie --

SAUNCHO
Sure unless you got the venue
changed to maybe like Orange

County -- not as many hippies down
there --
DOC
Sauncho who are you working for
SAUNCHO
Clients pay for work
BIGFOOT
Ive decided Im going to kick Mr
Sportello
SAUNCHO
Youre gonna kick him Thats
assault
DOC

(I think its police slang
Sauncho It means cut me loose)

BIGFOOT
Ill release the suspect at the
impound garage

SAUNCHO
promise

BIGFOOT
Promise And Ill even give hima
ride myself

SAUNCHO
Alright Im glad we got this
worked out then -- remember Doc
This was like 15 billable minutes

Are you aware of the dictum that
dope will get you through times of
no money better than vice versa
Youd be surprised how many in
your own hippie freak community
have found our Special Employee
Disbursements useful

DOC

like ‘Mod Squad’ Rat on
everybody I ever met

BIGFOOT
Right now theres fistfuls of
greenbacks flowing at anything
that even looks like local law
enforcement

BIGFOOT (CONTD)
Federal funding as far as the eye
can see or we could certainly
offer you compensation in a more
inhalable form Acapulco Gold

filled up long ago Doc
Numberless
kilos of righteous weed just for
you Just for trivial information
we already have anyway And what

BIGFOOT
Sorry youre not my type What

they have them on planet hippie

DOC
You have kids

BIGFOOT

veiled doper threat

DOC
Its just strange that here we
both are with this mysterious
power to ruin each others day and
we dont even know anything about

essence of law enforcement So

So this thing that happened to
your husband

HOPE HARLINGEN
Whatever he took that killed him
wasnt California smack for sure

DOC
Who was the dealer

HOPE HARLINGEN
El Drano in Venice

DOC
Was Coy a steady customer

HOPE HARLINGEN
Known him for years -- what does a
dealer care Overdoses are good
for business --

DOC

Sudden herds of junkies
at the door thinking it
some really good shit

showing up
must be
Something

like that

HOPE HARLINGEN
You got it Mr Sportello I
dont think Coy is really dead

DOC
Did you ID the body

HOPE HARLINGEN
No Whoever called me said
somebody from his band did that

DOC

Its supposed to be next of kin

HOPE HARLINGEN
And this this deposit showed up
close to his disappearance

She brings out a BANK STATEMENT book and shows it to him
points to a CREDIT Doc raises his eyebrows at the

amount

DOC
Interesting sum

HOPE HARLINGEN

He had no insurance policies that
I knew about Why would this big
deposit suddenly appear in our
account and be anonymous

DOC
Is there a picture of Coy you
could spare

She hands him a BOX FULL OF POLAROIDS Doc looks inside

We see

COY HARLINGEN Coy with the baby Coy cooking

heroin Coy tying off Coy shooting up Coy and Hope out
at the beach sitting ina pizza joint playing tug-of-war
with the last slice sticking his dick in his saxophone

SORTILEGE (VO)
These were perilous times
astrologically speaking for
dopers -- especially those of high
school age whod been born most
of them under a ninety-degree
aspect the unluckiest angle
possible between Neptune
the dopers planet and Uranus
the planet of rude surprises Doc
had known it to happen that those
left behind would refuse to
believe that people they loved or
even took the same classes with
were really dead They came up
with all kinds of alternate
stories so it wouldnt have to be
true

DOC
Okay if I take this one

HOPE HARLINGEN
Sure

AT THE DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

DOC
How did your husband know Shasta
Fay

Doc thought it might be

Wolfmann would react when somebody
brought up the topic If Mickey

I just heard that she skipped

PENNY

Put it another way How close

were you and Shasta Fay Hepworth

In walks DEPUTY DA PENNY KIMBALL (30s)
DOC
Well now Ive been asking myself
that very question It was all
over years ago Months If you
hadnt come along babe who knows
how bad it mightve got

PENNY
True You were a fucking mess
when I met you

DOC
And how ‘bout now

PENNY
Old times aside have you had any
contact with Miss Hepworth in
say the last week or so

DOC
Well now funny you should ask
because she called me up a couple
days ago before Mickey Wolfmann
disappeared with a story about how
his wife and her boyfriend were
plotting to hustle Mickey
into the booby hatch and grab all
his money So I sure hope you
guys or the cops or whoever are
looking into that

PENNY
And with your years of experience
as a PI would you call that a
reliable lead

DOC
Ive known worse Or are you all
just gonna just ignore that Some
hippie chick with boyfriend
trouble brains all mushed up with
dope sex rock and roll --

PENNY
Ive never seen you this
emotional Doc

DOC
‘Cause the lights are out
usually Ive never had lunch
with you before

PENNY
You didnt tell any of this to
Lieutenant Bjornsen when he pulled
you in at the crime scene And
Bjornsen seems to think youre as
good a suspect as any --

DOC
‘Seems to’ Youve been talking
to Bigfoot About me

PENNY
Doc Shhh Please Besides
maybe you did do it has that
crossed your mind yet Maybe
you just forgot (Maybe you just
conveniently forgot about it the
way you do so often forget things
and this peculiar reaction of
yours is a typically twisted way
of confessing the act)

DOC
Did do what

PENNY
Kill Glenn Charlock

DOC
Kill him What How would I
forget something like that

PENNY
Grass and who knows what else
Doc

DOC
Im only a light smoker

How many joints a day do you
smoke

DOC
I I11 have to check the log
book

PENNY

You cant remember

I dont keep track

PENNY
Or maybe you cant keep track

I dont think my smoking has any
link to the Wolfmann-Charlock
Shasta case --

PENNY
No Why did Shasta Fay
Hepworth dismantle your
relationship

DOC
She had other fish to fry

PENNY
Would you say youre still in love
with her

No Wait what is this Im not --

Its come to our attention that
not too long ago you had a visit
from a black prison militant
calling himself Tariq Khalil We
naturally became curious

acquaintance of his Glen
Charlock is slain Michael
Wolfmann disappears and you get
arrested and let go on suspicion

So what do you want with me

FLATWEED
Ordinarily were the ones asking
the questions

DOC
Sure thing fellas except arent
we all in the same business

FLATWEED
Theres no need to be insulting

BORDERLINE
Why dont you just share with
us what Mr Khalil had to say the
other day when he visited you

DOC
Because hes a client so thats
privileged is why

BODERLINE
If it has a bearing on the
Wolfmann case we might have to
disagree

DOC
I wish I could help -- but what I
cant figure is if your shop is
really so focused on the Black
Panthers and all that then whats
with your interest in Mickey
Wolfmann

LONG PAUSE No one says anything

DOC
- Are you guys figuring Mickeys
kidnapping as a Black Panther
operation Did they put the
snatch on Mickey to make a
political point A nice shot at
some ransom money

Flatweed and Borderline blink a lot and look nervous

DOC
Maybe youve at least thought
of putting that out there as a
cover story for whatever did
happen Can I be frank for a
minute

Of course

Fly me to the moon let me
swing among those stars Tell

been

Burke Stodger got blacklisted

EXTINT DOC’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Doc walks the long corridor towards his office

DOC

CUT TO

walks into his office is deep in thought locks the door
double and triple lock turns and SCREAMS AT THE SIGHT OF
A SEXY YOUNG BIKER GIRL CLANCY CHARLOCK

DOC
AHHHAHAHAHHA COOTIE FOOD

CLANCY
Remains to be seen

DOC
WHO ARE YOU

CLANCY
Clancy Charlock

DOC
Glen Charlock’s

CLANCY
Sister

DOC
I’m sorry about your brother

CLANCY

Glen was a shit and bound to have
his series canceled sometime But
that don’t keep me from wanting to
know who his killer is

DOC
You talk to the police

CLANCY
They talked to me Some smart-ass
named Bjornsen Can’t say it was
encouraging But I guess he’s a
fan of yours Would you mind not
staring at my tits like that

DOC
Sorry -- I was just reading your
T-shirt So now you say
Lieutenant Bjornsen referred you
to me

CLANCY

He sounded a lot more concerned
with Mickey Wolfmanns
disappearance than Glens murder
which I guess is no big surprise
Is that a joint Can I smoke it

Doc pulls out a freshly rolled one

DOC
Heres a new onePlease

She lights it and smokes half of it down in one suck
before passing it back to Doc

DOC
The theory downtown is that your
brother tried to prevent whoever
it was from putting the snatch on
Mickey and got shot for doing his
job

CLANCY
Way too sentimental

DOC
Then maybe he saw something he
shouldnt have

CLANCY
Thats how Boris has it figured
to

DOC
Whos that

CLANCY
Another member of Mickeys muscle
patrol Theyve all dropped out
of sight but last night Boris
called me late We have some
history Right now hes scared
shitless

DOC
What of

CLANCY

He said Mickey was in the deepest
shit you could get in all because
of this idea that came to him

DOC
Which was

CLANCY
All the money he ever made -- he
was working on a way just to give
it back

DOC
Can I still get my name on the
list

CLANCY

Thats what I said

DOC
Why but why would he want to

CLANCY

Wouldnt be the first rich guy

on a guilt trip lately He was
doing a lot of acid and peyote and
maybe it just got to a point
you mustve seen that happen

DOC
Once or twice but its more

like calling in sick for a couple
days breakin up with your old
lady nothing on that scale

CLANCY
He said he felt bad about making
people pay for shelter -- that all
along he should have realized it
shouldve been for free --

DOC
He told him that
CLANCY
Boris heard him say it he
wanted to build a big place out in
the desert where anybody could
come and live for free -- called
Arrepentimiento

DOC
Yeah okay and whats that mean
again

CLANCY
Spanish for ‘sorry about that’
The idea was if there was an open
unit -- it was yours for free
anyone from anywhere can have
shelter are you gonna keep
holding on to that joint or are
you gonna marry it

DOC
And what about Mickeys ladies
Any of them object to his big
giveaway

CLANCY
Only one Ive heard Boris say
anything about is Shasta -- the
ones gone missing

DOC
Whatd he say

CLANCY
Said Shasta was the only one that
ever made any sense around there --
she was nervous about Mickey
givin away all his money -- which
I guess caused some problems
because it made him think thats
all she was worried about was her
meal ticket -- which I guess was
really crazy cause she was in love
with him Deeply in love

DOC
Shasta and I lived for a short
while together and I cant say for
sure how deep it went How she
really felt about me

CLANCY
Well I hope this aint a bummer
for you to be hearin

DOC
Clancy I only look like an evil
motherfucker secretly Im as

sentimental as any ex-old man

CLANCY
You are a pretty dangerous hombre
I can see that but as one
whos been down this particular
exit ramp -- you can only cruise
the boulevards of regret so far
and then youve got to get back up
onto the freeway again

DOC
Who else does he think was worried
about Mickeys big giveaway
Business partners The wife

CLANCY
That cop friend of yours kept
showing up at the house all the
time warning Mickey

DOC
Bigfoot So he warned Mickey to
what

CLANCY

I dont know (Mickey didnt
listen to advice maybe he said
dont give away all your money
Stop doing peyote Stop doing
acid Youre the detective)

says

(You look familiar -- are you the
guy on the nickel)

THOMAS JEFFERSON
Thomas Jefferson So Guns and
Opium The Golden Fang not only
traffic in enslavement they
peddle the implements of
liberation as well

DOC

Yeah but as a founding father
dont you get freaked out a little
with this revolution talk

THOMAS JEFFERSON
The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time with
the blood of patriots and tyrants
It is its natural manure

DOC
Yeah and what about when the
patriots and tyrants turn out to
be the same people

THOMAS JEFFERSON
As long as they bleed is the
thing

Doc deep in thought

THOMAS JEFFERSON
A nickel for your thoughts

DOC
Glen Charlock If Glen was tight
with the Golden Fang could they
be the ones who took him out Is
he just another Rudy Blatnoyd DDS
who touched some acupressure point
on the mysterious body of the
Golden Fang so uncomfortably he
had to be dealt with

THOMAS JEFFERSON
Nobody trusted Glen -- the Aryan
Brotherhood had him shitlisted
as a traitor to his race the
Vigilant California was more than
eager to help -- and the raid on
Channel View Estates was a cover
for the hit on Glen --

DOC
And so Mickey Wolfmann

THOMAS JEFFERSON
Mickey was a witness -- he walked
in on something he shouldnt have
the VC commandoes hustled him
off -- Then the Feds found out
heres an acid-head billionaire
ready to give away all his money --
and of course they had their own
ideas on how to spend it As long
time associates of the Golden Fang
by way of scag-related activities
they got Mickey programmed into
Ojai for a little brain work --

DOC
Wait wait wait -- how do you
know all this

THOMAS JEFFERSON
Im on the nickel Im
everywhere I see everything

Every time a hippie puts his hand
out for loose change -- there I
am

crazed hippies

respected lawyer down in Palos

BIGFOOT has some PANCAKES that he eats with two forks

BIGFOOT
Id share these with you but then
youd be addicted and itd be
something else on my conscience

A75

DOC
you ever feel bitter you
missed bein up there at Cielo
Drive Stompin around that
famous crime scene

BIGFOOT
You want the truth
DOC
Um No
BIGFOOT

Well here it is anyway Right
now everyone is really scared

DOC
Who You Me

BIGFOOT
Odd that fear should be running
the town again as in days of old
like the Hollywood blacklist you
dont remember and the Watts
rioting you do -- it spreads like
blood in a swimming pool till it
occupies all the volume of the
day And then maybe some playful
soul shows up with a bucketful of
piranhas dumps them in the pool
and right away they can taste the
blood They swim around looking
for whats bleeding but getting
more and more crazy till the
craziness reaches a point Which
is when they begin to feed on each
other

BIGFOOT takes a BIG BITE

BIGFOOT
This Coy Harlingen matter On the
face of it just one more OD
one less junkie case cleared

DOC
So tell me what youve got

Bigfoot presents some 3x5 INDEX CARDS displays them
like a card trick

BIGFOOT
Pick a card any card These
are Field Interrogation Reports
see if you find anything that
looks familiar

Doc picks the card that Bigfoot favors to him
BIGFOOT
Puck Beaverton Excellent choice
One of Mickey Wolfmanns
bodyguards

DOC
Interesting fellow I hear

BIGFOOT
Sheriffs people happen to run
into him at the Venice home of the
very dealer who sold Coy Harlingen
the smack that killed him

DOC
So what was Puck doing at Coys
dealers place

BIGFOOT
The interesting thing about this
overdose is that Leonard James
Loosemeat AKA El Drano was known
for this three-percent product
but the report says what killed
him was Pure China White No 4

DOC
Like the kind youd get from the
whole-seller Like whoevers
bringing it in

BIGFOOT
I seem to recall that some years
ago just before he went into
Folsom Beaverton used to work for
your best friend and loan shark
Adrian Prussia

DOC
Your best friend

BIGFOOT
And this dealer El Drano also
happened to be one of Prussias
steady customers Maybe Puck was
there on Adrians behalf
What do you think

DOC
I think you and Adrian have a
history youre not sharing

BIGFOOT screams to the Japanese WAITERS

BIGFOOT
CHOOTO KENICHIRO DOZO MOTTO

You got it Lieutenant

BIGFOOT
(to Doc)
Pancakes arent quite as good as
my mother’s -- what I really go

for here is the respect

DOC
Didnt get enough of that from
your mom

BIGFOOT
You probably imagine I have a lot
of status up in Robbery-Homicide
Who could blame you for thinking
that The reality however No
Cielo Drive for Bigfoot No TV
movie rights or book deals for
Bigfoot even the extra work is
drying up God Help Us All
Dentists on trampolines

Bigfoot is shaking his head slowly Doc doesnt know how
to deal with this

DOC
Okay Bigfoot

DOC writes something on a napkin

DOC
It was dark windy roads couldnt
make it back there if I tried in
broad daylight --

He slides the napkin to him

DOC
Thats the address where we
dropped Dr Rudy It was about
eleven

BIGFOOT

Thats just where we found him
This helps with the chronology
Hair and drug issues
notwithstanding I think youre
being very professional about
this

DOC
Dont get sentimental on me man
it fucks up your edge

BIGFOOT
I can be even more emotionally
irresponsible than that
(MORE)

BIGFOOT (CONTD)
There are certain polygraph keys
on this case that if I told you
what they were then the only ones
whod know would be Homicide the
killer and you

DOC
Good thing youre not telling me

BIGFOOT
Suppose I tell you anyway

DOC
Why should you

BIGFOOT
Just so we know where were ‘at’
as you people say

DOC
How about I put my fingers in my
ears and scream if you try and
tell me

BIGFOOT
You wont do that

DOC
Really Why dont I

BIGFOOT
Because youre one of the few
hippie potheads in this town that
appreciate the distinction between
childlike and childish
Besides its right up your
alley -- were officially calling
it a neck injury --

DOC PLUGS HIS EARS AND STARTS TO MAKE NOISES blah blah
blah BIGFOOT SMACKS HIS HANDS AWAY

BIGFOOT
Dr Blatnoyd had puncture wounds
on his throat consistent with
bites from canines of a midsize
wild animal Thats what the
coroner found

DOC
Well now thats mighty weird
Bigfoot Because Rudy Blatnoyd
was one of the partners in a tax
dodge that calls itself the Golden
Fang Enterprises I dont suppose
you had the SID test out those
neck punctures for gold or nothin
like that

BIGFOOT
I shouldnt think thered be much
trace Gold is all but chemically
inactive as you might have
learned in chemistry class if you
hadnt been ditching all the time
to score dope

DOC

What happened to Locards Exchange
Principle Every contact leaves
traces It would sure be ironic
man is all Im saying if it
turned out Blatnoyd was bit to
death by a golden fang Or even
better like two golden fangs

BIGFOOT
I dont see why anything like that
would be material

DOC
Because its the fucking Golden
Fang

BIGFOOT
The descendents tax shelter So
what

DOC

Not just a tax shelter Bigfoot
Maybe something much more more
vast

BIGFOOT

And this wouldnt be just more of
your paranoid hippie bullshit
would it

DOC
And have the lab look for traces
of copper Not the kind that goes
stumbling all over the crime scene
contaminating evidence -- more
like copper the metal See gold
teeth are never pure gold
dentists like to alloy it with
copper If you hadnt ditched
forensics class to go steal
hubcaps to plant on some
innocent hippie you might have
known that

Doc gets up and leaves

Bet you almost feel like a cop

be on his karmic ticket

himself’ but the only thing is I
dont think he can

But whatever these people are
into it aint helping junkies get
back on the straight and narrow
What did he think was gonna

this

PENNY
Adrian Prussia has been booked
on murder one charges more times

PENNY
Adrians like the LAPDS own
personal hitman doing deeds
for them that they wont do
themselves

DOC
And you know all this because

PENNY
Everyone does State Attorney
Generals office has been after
him for years but nobody can touch
him partly because of this
interesting portfolio of
I0Us he has -- and thats always
enough to guarantee obedience

DOC
Obedience to who

PENNY
Commanders Controllers The
Department itself

DOC
So someone inside the LAPD ordered
a hit on Bigfoots partner

PENNY
You think its all some monolithic
fun fest down here Doc Nothing
to do all day but figure out new
ways to persecute you hippies

DOC
Did you change your hair

PENNY
You wanted to see a restricted
file (Adrian Prussia)

DOC

So Adrian Prussia kills Bigfoots
partner with the apparent
collaboration of elements within
the Department Everybody knows
he did the deed but theres no
back channel outcries in the
paper no vigilante revenge by
horrified fellow officers No
instead its locked up tight for
the next thirty years everybody
pretending its another cop hero
fallen in the line of duty
Forget about decency or
respecting the memories of all the
real dead-cop heroes -- how can
people be that fuckin
unprofessional

Penny is tearing up Doc sees shes human

CLOSEUP - DOC

looking at Adrian Prussias INTERNAL AFFAIRS FILE He
sees of picture of Adrian onboard the GOLDEN FANG

SORTILEGE (VO)
What Doc was seeing now was
something that made his heart
hurt that Bigfoots pain was
deep That Adrian Prussia worked
not only as a what seemed to
be a personal loan shark for the
LAPD but moon-lit as their own
personal contract-killer -- doing
deeds for them that they couldnt
do themselves Time after time
he was pulled in questioned
arraigned indicted no matter --
somehow the cases never quite got
to trial each being bargained
down in the interests of justice
not to mention Adrian who
invariably walked And one of
those deeds appeared to be

I lent you my special edition Carl
Yastrzemski bat once to collect
from that child-support deadbeat
you chased down the Greyhound and
pulled him off of and then you
wouldnt use it

(You didnt take my advice)
So what can I help you with today

DOC
Im not sure Its these cases
Im working on wondering if you
can shed some light on the winding
out at Channel View Estates with
Glen Charlock

PUCK
Glen was the target all along
That outfit he was runnin guns
for didnt trust him anymore than
the Brotherhood who shitlisted him
for being a traitor to his race

DOC
And what about Mickey Wolfmann
PUCK
Mickey just saw things he
shouldntve The boys in the
John Wayne outfits at Channel View
panicked and hustled him away --

then the Feds found out -- heres
an acid-head billionaire about to
give away all his money -- and of

course they had their own ideas
on how to spend it -- then they
programmed Mickey into Ojai for a
little brain work

DOC
While were just talking here --
did you know a detective named
Vincent Indelicato

PUCK
Sure
DOC
He met an untimely end -- any

ideas on what might have happened

PUCK
That was Adrians But I got to
pull the trigger

DOC
So who hired Adrian

PUCK
Its cop-on-cop Kind of a waste
of time to try and figure out

DOC
Why are you telling me all
this

PUCK

After faithful attendance at Ninja

DOC
The LAPDs not sure it was an
accident

CROCKER FENWAY
And youre wondering if I did it
What possible motive would I have
Just because the man preyed on an
emotionally vulnerable child tore
her from the embrace of a loving
family forced her to engage in
sexual practices that might appall
even a sophisticate like yourself
-- does that mean Id have any
reason to see his miserable
pedophile career come to an end
What a vindictive person you must
imagine me

DOC
You know I did suspect he was
fucking his receptionist

(MORE)

DOC (CONTD)
But I mean what dentist doesnt
its some oath they all have to
take in dentist school and anyhow

114 INT DOCS CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT

Doc driving on the freeway Shasta is curled up in the
passenger seat A fog is rolling in on the Santa Monica
Freeway Headlights drift ahead and behind him

SHASTA
Remember that day the Ouija board
set us off into that big storm

DOC
One of a couple things I never
forgot -- dont know why

SHASTA

This feels the same way tonight
Just us Together Almost like
being underwater The world
everything gone someplace else

DOC
Figured it was Sortilege just
settin us up

SHASTA
No she

DOC
Her Ouija board

SHASTA
She knows things Doc maybe
about us that we dont know

DOC
This dont mean were back
together

SHASTA

Course not
She drifts -- off to sleep

SORTILEGE (VO)
Doc fell into a car convoy moving
slowly single lane through the
fog He figured if he missed the
Gordita Beach exit hed take the
first one whose sign he could read
and work his way back on surface
streets He knew that at
Rosecrans the freeway began to
dogleg east and at some point
Hawthorne Boulevard or Artesia
hed lose the fog unless it was
spreading tonight and settled in
region wide Maybe then it would
stay this way for days maybe hed
have to just keep driving down
past Long Beach down through
Orange County and San Diego and
across a border where nobody could
tell anymore in the fog who was
Mexican who was Anglo who was
anybody Then again he might run
out of gas before that happened
and have to leave the caravan and
pull over on the shoulder and
wait For whatever would happen
For a forgotten joint to
materialize in his pocket For the
CHP to come by and choose not to
hassle him For a restless blonde
in a Stingray to stop and offer him
a ride For the fog to burn off
and for something else this time
somehow to be there instead
