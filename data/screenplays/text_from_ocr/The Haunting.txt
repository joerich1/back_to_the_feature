Drawn shades Dim The first traces of dust

Nell lingers in the doorway a beat daunted

A perfectly made bed The PILLOW however retains the IMPRESSION
of a head Lodged between the bed and a nightstand a CANE On
the opposite side of the bed is a plastic toilet IV stand
Shrouded white shapes

On the wall above the bed a framed needlepoint counsels A PLACE
FOR EVERYTHING EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE A bit of wisdom A way
to live a life

OLD HOUSE IN BERKSHIRES PSYCHOLOGY STUDY

END MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE
INT PSYCH OBSERVATION LAB - DAY
The lab feels more like the video center of a security office

a psychologists laboratory Two banks of black and white

monitors

give us images of men and women different ages different races
wired to electrodes They are taking psychological tests

although

time

to

two

now

we never see the Testers The subjects are working through
variations on object manipulation and pattern recognition tests
There are subtle differences between the two banks of monitors

the left the subjects are all twitching at exactly the same

on the right the subjects are also twitching but in no
discernible sequence The subjects on the left are better able

concentrate on their tasks The subjects on the right keep
stopping and going over what they have done

Two men MALCOLM KEOGH in his 50s is a graying professor the
head of the department someone we trust

He faces PROFESSOR JAMES MARROW He is a man whose confidence
rests uneasily on his ambition and in the tension between the

is the power that makes him the teacher students love Right

though he is defending himself before a Department Review This
is not a court martial with judges behind a desk its more free
form

The men are having a fight and they are watched by OTHER
PROFESSORS

MALCOLM
Its still an electric shock

MARROW
Come on Malcolm its only seven
ohms its nothing its like a
joy buzzer And its not about
the pain its about the
interference with concentration
to

Malcolm looks at the monitor This is Marrows chance to explain
it again

MARROW (contd)
Look look at what it does The
subjects on the left because they
anticipate the shocks make the
adjustment and lose nothing on
their scores The subjects on the
right because the shocks are
random cant anticipate and the
distraction throws them off

MALCOLM
Stop defending your science after
the fact Jim The department
protocol for research is very
clear about this and you violated
the rules I know I know I know
that Fear and Performance is a
big sexy idea but as long as Im
chairman here you will need this
departments endorsement to
publish it and right now I cant
do that

At this moment MARY LAMBRETTA late 20s Marrows pretty TA
opens the door with an armload of files Whatever else shes
wearing she wears glasses Marrow seeing her motions for her

go away He doesnt break eye contact with Malcolm Mary
hesitates

MARROW
Malcolm this is essential work
Im doing Just think what my
research can do for education
Elementary school classrooms near
train tracks or airports where
loud noise is random this helps
to prove the need for sound
insulation if the children are
ever going to learn to read

MALCOLM
And that will be a good place to
end this study

MARROW
No Malcolm Individual
performance is only part of it I
know why baseball players choke
for no reason I know why
violinists throw up with fear
before every concert and need to
to give a great performance but
what I want to know is how fear
works in a group

MALCOLM
Not the way youve constructed
your group its just not ethical

MARROW
But if the group knows its being
studied as a group you
contaminate the results The
deception is minor

Malcolm sees Mary Lambretta

MALCOLM
Are you working with her

MARROW
Mary Ill meet you outside

She understands and she closes the door

MALCOLM
Why are you working with her
Mary Lambretta was thrown out of
the department for trying to get a
PhD in psychic studies

MARROW
And after she was thrown out she
needed a job

MALCOLM
You dont believe in the
paranormal

MARROW

No but she does and thats all
that matters

MALCOLM
Does she know thats why youre
using her

MARROW
No
MALCOLM
I I just cant

MARROW
She needed a job Malcolm And
shes smart And she helps me

MALCOLM
I have a bad feeling about what
youre doing

MARROW
This is the last chapter Please
please give me clearance Its
for science

Marrow waits

MALCOLM
Im gonna hate myself for this

But he nods Permission granted

MARROW
Thank you

INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE LAB - DAY
They open the door They walk out Mary is there She closes

her
eyes and does a gypsy voice

MARY
I see a hostile man hes (she
describes him) The hostile man

does not believe in Madame Velka

This relieves the pressure Malcolm is not listening anymore and
storms off

MARY
You know what hes really upset
about

MARROW
What

MARY

Youre going to publish hes
going to perish And why did you
hire me for this
it

and

Marrow has a sly smile They go into his office through another

door in the lab

INT MARROWS OFFICE - DAY

Long narrow badly lit its filled with filing cabinets stacks

of unread textbooks still in publishers plastic

a desk with

computer As soon as they enter Mary looks at the phone

MARY
Its for you

And then the phone rings He doesnt pick it right up he lets

ring

MARROW
You hear the vibrations in the
wire Theres a magnetic pulse in
the wires you feel it I could
test it

MARY
Test it

The phone still rings Marrow answers

MARROW
Yes this is Doctor Marrow

MARY
Howd I know it was for you

MARROW
(quickly)
Because its my phone
(back to the phone)
Yes Mrs Dudley just leave the
boxes inside thank you See you
soon Thank you

He hangs up

Marrow is trying to read the first file as he goes to his desk
Mary shows him a huge CORKBOARD covered with photos articles

various items

MARY
Heres how theyre organized
Groups of five very different
personalities scored all over the
Kiersey Temperament Sorter just
like you asked for And they all
score high on the insomnia charts

MARROW
Good

A PHOTO OF NELL falls on the floor Marrow scoops it up He

holds

the photo of Nell up to Mary and look at the written notes and
studies the graphs that go with it

MARROW (contd)
This is correct

MARY
Her mother died two months ago
She says she really wants to do
this I didnt know if itd be
taking advantage

Marrow considers the lonely image for a long moment and then

looks

to

at the graph of her test scores

MARROW
(meaning the graph
not the face)
What a beautiful profile How do
you feel about her What does
your intuition say

Mary balks at his teasing

MARY
I put my favorites on the top

Marrow continues to study the files
MARROW (OC)
Okay this ones good

Extrovert Feeler Okay This
one I like too

We dont pay as much attention now to the cork board as to other
images on the wall We find clinical-looking shots from Stanley
Milgrams experiments subjects appearing to scream in response

electrical shock

Rows of weeping prisoners in the Stanford prison experiment
Photos of victims crushed under the stands of a soccer stadium
the

aftermath of a riot A picture of the Fuhrer before his
mesmerized

masses Mary opens a large envelope She takes out a photograph
that we cant see

MARY

Whats this

(has to get his
attention)

Whats this this picture

MARROW
That Thats Hill House

MARY
This is where were going

MARROW
Yes Its perfect isnt it

Mary studies the picture and she cant answer him In her
glasses we get the thinnest reflection of the photograph a
glimpse of dark brick and high chimneys

INT NELLS CAR - DAY

Nell in a rust-wormed old Buick glances from the road to
computer-drawn DIRECTIONS TO HILL HOUSE She HUMS A TUNE soft
lonely like a lullaby but eerie off-key

EXT ROUTE 39 - DAY

The car speeds down the country road past old stone walls out

into rolling meadow its winding route taking it across the
western

Berkshires farther and farther into the glorious hills

INT NELLS CAR - DAY

Countryside speeds by She passes an antique store in a barn A
handpainted sign warns MELBYS APPLE FARM 100 YARDS Nell grabs
for the window handle letting in air

She snorts smelling breathing like it was the first time in her
life sounding like a pig And it makes her burst out in

embarrassing animal laughter

EXT HILLSDALE - DAY (ESTABLISHING)
The white-steepled church five stores and gas station of

Hillsdale

lie in a forgotten notch in the hills

EXT GAS STATION - DAY

Nell is pumping gas at a country station She is alone at the
pump As she finishes she hears a BABY CRYING She looks up

She is immediately drawn by the sound

She moves to a car at another pump The car is empty The

windows

it

are rolled up She peers into the car through the window and
sees a toddler in a car seat The child is crying Nell looks
around no one is there She makes faces at the baby coos to

NELL
Hello Baby

She does a peek-a-boo game and the baby stops crying the baby
even starts to giggle

A VOICE from behind

MOTHER (0S)
Whats going on what happened

Nell turns The Mother is a busy country mom arms filled with
stuff from the gas stations market

NELL
Shes okay She woke up and she
saw she was alone

The mother has the car open and the baby is smiling now

MOTHER
Say thank you Spencer
(too much of an
explanation)

The woman smiles in something like sympathy
we see a friendly GAS STATION ATTENDANT appear

When she does
behind Nell

NELL
Umm

and gets in her car

(contd)
Im a little lost

GAS STATION ATTENDANT

Where you going

Nell takes out her computer drawn directions and an old map

They sent me directions and Ive

NELL

confusing Here

its a place

His helpful attitude changes dramatically

GAS STATION ATTENDANT

Hill House

He takes the map book and tears out the page and crumples it up

NELL
What are you doing

GAS STATION ATTENDANT
You dont want to go there

He turns abruptly and walks away
NELL
Did I say something wrong to you

Nell slams the Buick door and breathing hard starts the engine
She gets control and puts the car in gear Shes shaken

Badly

EXT COUNTRY LANE - DAY

Nells Buick bounces over a country road The car works its way

up

into the steep switchbacking hills

INT NELLS CAR - DAY

Nell looks out at the forest feels a chill The road is more
like

a tunnel through the forest than a road

EXT HILLS - DAY

Nells car speeds through the trees climbing the hills higher
and

higher into the awesome solitude

INT NELLS CAR - DAY

Nell takes a final switchback and something off to the right

catches her eye then is gone in the trees She watches again
for

it There A glimpse of a gray stone property wall set back

twenty yards from the road

There it is again Moss-greened twenty feet high a wicked
array

of iron spikes and glass mortared atop it

And then out of the tangled forest in front of her looms a pair
of

immense stone pillars Between them a steel GATE as high as the
wall chained and padlocked

EXT HILL HOUSE GATE - DAY

The gate stands immense Silent Forbidding Beyond them a
gravel drive curves away through the trees Nell kills her car
gets out instructions in hand No one in sight A long beat
She reaches in and blows the HORN

The HORN shatters the air rackets off the trees beyond the gate
echoing Silence
Its

hair

no-

her

Nell blows the HORN a sustained staccato in annoyance The echo
replies in a terrible deafening battering of sound Nell covers
her ears Silence once again

In a fit of agitation she goes to the padlock and rattles it
locked good She turns --

-- and there is a man right behind her It is MR DUDLEY his
tied back like an ex-hippie He stands between Nell and her open
car door weed spear in hand He smiles at her -- rough dirty

massive

MR DUDLEY
What do you want

NELL
Oh You scared me

MR DUDLEY
Me No What are you doing here

NELL
Are you Mister Dudley the
caretaker

MR DUDLEY

Yeah Im Mister Dudley the
caretaker What are you doing
here

NELL
Im with Dr Marrows group Im
supposed to check in with Mrs
Dudley up at the house Is she
here

She hands him the directions He glances at them She uses the
distraction to get into her car

MR DUDLEY
Maybe she is

INT NELLS CAR - DAY
Nell looks at the gate some part of her aware its a point of
return Mr Dudley eases over to her window Mr Dudley gives

one last look and goes to the gate He produces a keyring and
undoes the padlock
NELL
Why do you need a chain like that

MR DUDLEY
Thats a good question What is
it about fences Sometimes a
locked chain makes people on both
sides of the fence just a little
more comfortable Why would that
be

He unwinds the enormous chain heavy turn after heavy turn The
gates swing in revealing HILL HOUSE

NELL
Is there something about the
house

MR DUDLEY

Mrs Dudleyll be waiting for you

Grinning Dudley steps aside and Nell rolls through And at that
he just grins wider Nell pulls away Disturbed she watches

him
in the rearview mirror She turns and in front of her sprawls
Hill
House At center the features of the oldest part of the House
dwarf all others towering eye-like windows and the jaws of a
Grand Entry with carved ebony doors
EXT HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAY - DAY
The car rumbles up the drive toward the carport
INT NELLS CAR - DAY
Nell stops the car in front of the entrance right inside the
carport In the silence all we can hear is her breathing
EXT HILL HOUSE - DAY
Her car sits in front of the house tiny alone Its brake
lights

go off

The finger-like pillars of the car port seem like a hand pinning
the car in place under the Houses gaze

Nell gets out of the car
Adam

been

from

then

Nell stares daunted yet there is something about the House

romance in its lilac heavy Gothic decay Nell feels it is drawn
to it

EXT GRAND ENTRY - DAY

Nell suitcase in hand climbs the steps to the front doors On
closer inspection the snaking shapes of the carved doors depict

Garden of Eden At center on the knocker a tarnished silver
takes the forbidden fruit from his counterpart Eve

Nell lifts Adam and knocks heavily There is no answer Nell
looks around for some sign of life

Off to one side is a LADDER and PAINT CANS Somebody mustve
touching up the window trim
When she looks back the door is AJAR a fraction of an inch
NELL
Hello Hello Mrs Dudley Mrs
Dudley are you here Anybody
Tentative she pushes it open into --

INT GRAND ENTRY - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

-- a vast entry towering away to a ceiling lost in shadow far
above Rays of light filter through floor-to-ceiling curtains
Doors lead off in a half dozen directions

Every piece of woodwork or plaster in the house is carved
filigreed painted or ornamented in wild ornate fashion It

overwhelms the eye

NELL
Wow

She turns around sets her suitcase on the marble floor A short
hallway straight ahead seems to let onto some vast space dimly
lit

And then Nell hears a SOUND Carrying through the empty halls

some distant place a low plaintive MOAN

Nell freezes The MOANING stops Nell strains her ears And
the MOAN again It comes from the short hallway ahead Nell
starts for it The Moan stops

INT HALL FROM ENTRY TO GREAT HALL - DAY

Nell moves down the hall Its dim stale lined with pier
tables
candelabra

NELL
Hello Hello Mrs Dudley

Her voice echoes from the room beyond She follows her own voice
into --

INT GREAT HALL - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

-- A long oval great hall Passages and doors lead off in all

directions to God-knows-where A double-grand staircase at the
far

end ascends to a landing shrouded in darkness before turning up

the
next floor Magnificent ANIMAL HEADS carved on the newel posts

glare at her

Nell makes her way past clusters of furniture stops at the
center

Silence An ENORMOUS FIREPLACE dominates one wall Large enough

to stand in An iron mesh SCREEN hangs in its mouth Mantle and

chimney rise in dark baroque masonry becoming lost in the
shadows

above

The MOANING sound Nell spins away from the fireplace The

sound
rises from the door at the very back of the hall Nell takes a

step toward it

NELL
Mrs Dudley

She moves up to the door puts a hand out to it The MOANING
rises Nell pushes through --

INT 1ST FLOOR HALLWAY TOWARDS KITCHEN - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

-- into a much narrower curving hallway Doors all along it
The

sound comes from the door right there across from the one Nell
just

came through She flings it open --
an

INT KITCHEN - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

-- and comes through into a vast kitchen A woman in black with
her back to Nell stands at a counter The moaning comes from a
disreputable old CAN OPENER

Nell breaths feels stupid The woman senses her turns from her
cans of potatoes She is MRS DUDLEY sallow unsmiling

MRS DUDLEY
Its make the soup or answer the

door Cant do both

NELL
Mrs Dudley

MRS DUDLEY
So far

Mrs Dudley wipes her hands regards Nell nods

NELL
Im Eleanor Vance Im with --

MRS DUDLEY
-- Dr Marrows group Youre the
first

Mrs Dudley just stares with her sunken face It unsettles Nell

MRS DUDLEY (contd)
Ill show you your room

INT GRAND STAIRWAYMEZZANINE - DAY
Mrs Dudley glides up the stairs Nell follows hoisting her
suitcase after her It appears the mezzanine ahead leads to a

hallway But as we draw closer what we thought was a hallway is

ENORMOUS OIL PAINTING In it stands a man his features lost in
the shadows above only his body visible

The nameplate reads HUGH CRAIN

NELL
Hugh Crain

Nell looks up Mrs Dudley waits coldly at the top of the stairs
INT 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY NORTH WING - DAY

Mrs Dudley leads Nell down a curved hallway over aged Persian
carpets and turns to a door on her left She throws it open

stands back Nell enters

INT NELLS ROOM - DAY

Nell lowers her suitcase

MRS DUDLEY

The Purple Room Youre going to

be the first visitors that Hill
House has had since Mister Crain
died

The room is spacious in a rococo gothic style with low-relief
woodwork on the walls rising to a dark coffered ceiling of

carved

ivory A king-size bed furniture all in blue purple An

door gives a glimpse of a bathroom

open

A large fireplace dominates one wall Its mantle is carved with

the faces of children happy at play alive
wood loving

NELL
Theyre so beautiful Arent
they

MRS DUDLEY
em Lot to dust

Ive seen

NELL
Well Ive never lived with
beauty You must love working

Mrs Dudley peers at her A beat And then

MRS DUDLEY
Its a job I keep bankers

serve yourselves Breakfast is
ready at nine I dont wait on
people I dont stay after
dinner Not after it begins to

the
NELL
Why would we --

MRS DUDLEY
-- no one could No one lives any
nearer than town No one will
come any nearer than that In the
night In the dark

And with that Mrs Dudley grins rictus-like She turns and
closes
the door after her

Nell stands there a long moment the room silent heavy old
She

goes to the windows peers out Nothing but forest for miles
The

sun is setting

Nell removes her windbreaker opens her suitcase takes out a

blouse and skirt Decent enough clothes but cheap the tags
still

on them

INT 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY NORTH WING - DAY

Nell emerges from her room in her new clothes The hallway
curves
away into the distance lined with massive ornate doorframes

like
the one to her room
Trying to get a better look Nell searches the walls for a light
switch but cant find one She follows the chair rail back to -
INT MEZZANINE - SUNSET (CONTINUOUS)
-- the mezzanine at the top of the stairs She searches in vain
for a light switch there Finally she spots a set of curtains
and
slings them open
The light late-day though it is makes her wince The window
looks down on the driveway Outside a BEIGE CAR crunches over
the

gravel Somebody else has arrived

Nell watches the car move past trying to get a glimpse of the
driver but from up here all she can see is roof

Finally
She backs away from the window spins around --
-- and out of the darkness powerful mad looms the visage of
Crain It is the painting It is only from up here on the
Floor with this curtain open that the FACE is visible in the

day sunlight

Despite the artists discretion the lines in the mans skin his
eyes his posture cry of unspeakable sickness

Unconsciously Nell takes a step back In the far bg near the
end of one of the halls a DOOR stands open the second or third
set of doors in the Gothic Hallway left of the painting Just as
it starts to come into view and were starting to see it it
swings silently shut

But Nell has caught the movement out of the corner of her eye
INT 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY NORTH WING - DAY

Nell stares down the long hallway Which door was it

NELL
Hello

No response She starts down the hall slow at first then
r

She passes door after door shadow after shadow and as she nears
the end of the hall there is no door here Not within 20 feet
of where we thought we just saw it

A WHISPER VOICES Nell backs away And then LAUGHTER Behind
her Its coming from another stairwell Very real and very
human

INT BACK STAIRWAY - DAY

Nell looks down from the top of the stairs Below Mrs Dudley
THEO 20s exotic sophisticated in Vera Wang leather wrestle

a pile of designer luggage Theo peers up Shes dark sexy in

amused worldly way someone who has seen and done it all

THEO
You may think I have a sickness
about packing but asking people
to help me shlep the stuff I take
with me everywhere is a cheap and
exploitative way of making new
friends My names Theo

Theo foists a very heavy bag off on Mrs Dudley who looks like
shes

been handed a snake That makes Nell smile She comes running
down

to help with the bags

NELL
Im Eleanor but everyone calls me
Nell Eleanor Vance Nell Im

Theo is a little thrown by Nells gushing

NELL (contd)

NELL

THEO

Mrs Dudley walking ahead looks back at them Then continues

up
Theo makes a face at Mrs Dudleys back Nell smiles a little

THEO

INT THEOS ROOM - DAY

Mrs Dudley opens the door letting Theo and Nell into a large

bedroom a mirror-image twin of Nells room except its
decorated

in rich red-orange velvets

THEO
This is so twisted

She dumps her stuff on the floor grabs a banister on the four-
poster bed swings cat-like onto its high mattress

MRS DUDLEY
I set dinner on the dining room
sideboard at six

Mrs Dudley lays Theos suitcase on a luggage stand

MRS DUDLEY
Breakfast is at nine I dont

Theo back to Mrs Dudley rolls her eyes at Nell

MRS DUDLEY (contd)

NELL
We couldnt even hear you

Mrs Dudley looks up at Nell who mimics her scary smile

MRS DUDLEY
No one could No one lives any
nearer than town

NELL
No one will come any nearer than
that

Mrs Dudley smiles at Nell but its softer than before

MRS DUDLEY
In the night In the dark

Theo leans on the bed musing at the exchange And then Mrs
Dudley
backs out of the room shuts the door

NELL (contd)
My room is right next door I

Theo has an interesting eye on Nell shes studying her

THEO

Over So And you

THEO
That depends

Theo pops a dress bag on the bed unzips it Theo takes off her

coat and is only wearing a black bra underneath Nell reacts

turns away Back to the camera Theo flicks off her bra
stretches

THEO (contd)
Im supposed to be an artist but
Ive been really distracted from
work by love Do you know what I
mean

NELL
Not really

THEO
Dont tell me Boston is different
from New York

NELL
(she knows this
from magazines)
Ohh sure you have trouble with
commitment

THEO
My boyfriend thinks so my
girlfriend doesnt If we could
all live together but they
hate each other Its hard to be
Miss Perversity when youre the
only one at the party Dyou know

NELL
No

THEO
(delighted)
A blank canvas I could paint
your portrait directly on you
Or maybe not So you Husbands
Boyfriends Girlfriends Where
do you live

NELL

I dont have anyone

(beat lying)
But I do have a little apartment
of my own It has a little flower
garden You can just see the
ocean At night when the wind
comes in just right you can hear
the buoys in the harbor

Nell peeks sees Theo is decent turns around

THEO
That sounds really nice Youre
lucky But you know that

Theo comes over straightens Nells seams this is an intimate
forward gesture

THEO (contd)
(with meaning)
Come on weve seen enough of the
bedroom for now
INT 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - DUSK

The long hall is lost in shadow its long rows of doors waiting

in

the deadening silence A lamp on a pier table casts a small pool
of

light The walls glow in rich tones the low-relief carvings a

worms-wood of shadow

Nell runs her hand over a wall panel as Theo peeks into a

neighboring room

NELL
So much carving Its everywhere
On everything

Theo starts down the hall Nell follows

INT RED PARLOR - DUSK

Nell and Theo enter a room just off the landing a lavish parlor

with the omnipresent panelled walls lush red carpet velvet

curtains sweeping floor to ceiling heavy pieces of furniture
Nell

watches Theo explore As Theo moves through the room Nells eye

lands on another painting of Hugh Crain Inside its ornate
golden

framework distinctive little cherubs are embedded Cherubs of

Death She runs her fingers over it

THEO

Maybe you shouldnt touch --
Theo twirls out of the room Nell anxious behind her
INT MEZZANINE - DUSK

As they come out of Crains study Theo stops at the top of the
stairs Nell behind her

THEO
Jeez

NELL
I know

They stare out at Hugh Crain the cracking and shadowing of the
swirls of oil that compose his face The figure is daunting but
dead Just a painting Four different hallways lead into the
mezzanine all dark and endless in the stray light
NELL (contd)
Maybe we should wait for them
here

Theo walks out swings around

THEO
Which one Pick any

Nell looks from one to another She doesnt want to But she

forces a smile and points to one on the left They both
disappear

into the dark gothic hallway

INT SMALL PARLOR (CONFUSING ROOMS) - DUSK

Theo breezes into a small parlor with heavy green velvet
curtains

panelled walls rich settees Other doors lead off the room
Nell

follows

THEO
This is a serious question but do
you think the Dudleys ever make
love in this room Theyre alone
in the house no one watching No
one no one watching You can
do what you want

Theo goes running for another door and is out

Nell realizing shes being left behind springs after her into
another mysterious hallway --

INT STATUARY HALL - DUSK (CONTINUOUS)

-- into a wide hall lined with niches and classical statuary
Theo

strides down it pointing left and right bending over straddling

the pieces provocative

THEO
Here Here Here
(under a leering
gargoyle)
Oh yes Oh yes oh YES Here

Nell laughs -- appalled and loving every minute of it

THEO (contd)
Cant you just see it
NELL
Theo

INT HALL OF MIRRORS - DUSK (CONTINUOUS)

Through a narrow passageway and large double doors they suddenly

stand at the threshold of a fantastic ballroom lined with mirrors

and chandeliers Rows of mirror-coated octagonal pillars rise
toa

vaulted mirrored ceiling far above With the door opening
theres

a CLICK and a mechanism of some sort is activated The FLOOR

begins to MOVE like a slow turntable

Theo comes right up looks over Nells shoulder Nell steps out

She traipses out across the room her million reflections
waltzing

with her into infinity Theo dances after her They dance not

quite together Nell stops and pronounces

NELL
I love this house I really love
this house

THEO

(gently recognizes
that Nell is
different)

Youre okay

Nell blushes and they burst out laughing They take off
running

their reflections with them stampeding for an archway on the far

side of the room and out --

INT 1ST FLOOR HALLS (VARIOUS) - DUSK (CONTINUOUS)

-- into yet another hallway They race down the hall turn into

another hall then another all dimly lit by the very last rays
of

day all furnished in the Houses dark impossibly complicated

impossibly ornate fashion As they go the mood is growing
darker

the women unaware that they are getting lost

THEO
(having fun)
Rats Were rats in a maze
Thats what this experiment is
going to be
They open a door to --
INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - DUSK (CONTINUOUS)

They stand at the end of a long hallway to one of the Houses

forgotten outlying wings It is dark Too dark Nell and Theo

regard the darkness

At the far end of the hall stand a pair of MAHOGANY DOORS
closed

almost black oily-looking Surrounding them an enormously
complex

geometrical frieze

The doors themselves are plain In their simplicity there is

something about them enormously disturbing It is as if the
doors

are looking back at them Nell goes cold Theo holds herself

NELL
We should go back

Theo nods They turn around Theo opening what she thinks was
the
door they came through

INT NARROW STAIRCASE - DUSK

They hurry down a narrow staircase Theo first Nell right
behind

NELL
Theo Im scared --

They fly down a set of steps Theo flings open a final door --
and
SCREAMS

INT GRAND ENTRY - NIGHT

The Grand Entry where they bump into LUKE SANDERSON 20s
charming
and cynical

LUKE
Hi Luke Sanderson bad sleeper
Im your basic tosser-turner and
you are

NELL
Uh Nell Vance
LUKE
And what kind of sleeper

NELL
Well I uh
LUKE

Obsessive worrier Join the club
(to Theo)

And you Id guess

THEO
Youll never guess

She wont answer

Marrow comes in the front door He looks at the house like
MacArthur studying a beachhead

MARROW
There we are Youre Eleanor
youre Luke youre Theo

ALL
Hi hello Dr Marrow

MARROW
And this is Todd he just came up

TODD comes in

TODD
Hi Im Todd Aubochon

LUKE
(1950s alien
spaceman)
Greetings fellow insomniac

TODD

(playing)
Greetings fellow sheep counter

MARROW
And this is my assistant Mary
Lambretta

LUKE
Greetings

And Mary enters Crossing the threshold she catches her breath
and when she comes into the hall and sees everyone she also
the house in its detail And she has a bad feeling

Marrow is still putting everyone at ease

MARROW
Eleanor how was the drive

NELL
You can call me Nell Dr Marrow

MARROW
Nell Good enough And Im Jim

NELL
Im really honored to be part
of this study Jim

MARROW
Well were glad to have you

His smile is devastating Nell reddens instantly taken by
Marrows
warmth observant sensitivity Theo notices

MARROW
Have either of you seen David
Watts

THEO

No but Nells been here longer
than I have

NELL
I only saw Theo drive up

LUKE
Whos Watts

MARROW
The man who completes the group

sees

For a long moment they stand there silent looking at each other

polite smiles but awkward even Marrow One by one they all
look
to him for a cue

MARROW (contd)
Well why dont we get some dinner
while were waiting for him
(beat backing
through the doors
to the Great Hall)
Welcome to Hill House everyone

INT GREAT HALL - NIGHT

Marrow leads the way across the hall The others check out the
furnishings as they pass

TODD
These old Victorian houses are
great arent they

LUKE

(points to details

ADJUST FOR SET)
Its not Victorian everyone
thinks that the whole nineteenth
century was Victorian This is
gothic this is English Craftsman
this is Romanesque This is
insane Who lives here

MARROW
Nobody A local mill owner Hugh
Crain built it in 1830 He had
no heirs but he put the house in
trust and the farmland around it
with the stipulation that it never
be altered or sold Crains
executors made good investments
and for the last hundred and
twenty years Hill House has taken
care of itself

Mary is shaken by the house but shes honoring Marrows request
Everywhere she looks she feels the presence of something

TODD
So whats this study all about
anyway Mary described the kind
of tests well be doing but
didnt fill us in on the big
picture She said you needed bad
sleepers but this wasnt about
curing the problem

MARY
I can tell you what this is about

MARROW
Eat first questions later Mary
please

They exit the hall Mary and Nell last and as they do Nell sees
Marys strange look She stops

NELL
Is something wrong

MARY
No Just when I saw your
picture I had a feeling about you
and now that I meet you I know I
was right

NELL
What

MARY
Eat first questions later

And suddenly awkward Mary exits after the others
INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A chandelier hangs unlit over a long dining table LAUGHTER At

the end Nell and the others sprawl over the remains of a dinner

which has been going on for hours Luke is opening another
bottle

of jug wine

LUKE
You know what I love about wine
that comes in bottles like this

TODD
What

LUKE
Every year is a good year

MARROW
Theo Its your turn

Theo twirls her wine glass licks the dregs inside the rim
thinking

THEO
The rest of you may hate your
insomnia but I find it the best
time of the day for me Im
alone Nobodys talking to me but
myself My mind is racing with
ideas and I can think

LUKE
Nah youre going crazy with
doubt all of your mistakes are
coming back up the pipes and its
worse than a nightmare --

Nell isnt used to people being so direct and at the same time
playful She glances at Marrows LEFT HAND NO WEDDING RING

THEO (contd)
Excuse me

LUKE

Dont give me that look its
everybodys problem we just have
different variations I for
example I fall asleep easily
But I wake up around two or three
in the morning every morning
Its that time of night that
Fitzgerald called the deep dark
night of the soul I stare
into the abyss Every night

(breaks his own

somber mood)
Its the price I pay for being
such a jolly fellow

(to Mary)
Y usted

MARY
I think Id fall asleep easily
but just as I start to feel
comfortable I see things in the
dark

Nell hears this Nell is tuned into Mary

MARY
I feel the presence of something
watching me Its not scary
not by itself but I dont want

to go to sleep because Im worried
about the thing attacking me So
when I finally do fall asleep Im
like a soldier whos fallen asleep
at her post I feel like Ive
betrayed myself Nell

Nell wishes she could hide under her plate
NELL
All of you have such interesting
problems

Theres laughter

NELL (contd)
No Please I know how that
sounds but Youre all so
articulate You know how to talk
I feel like Im here under false
pretenses Its silly its not
like well all of you have
trouble sleeping because you live
in the world and the world is
complicated and scary but
nothings ever happened to me So
I dont have a reason to sleep

badly

MARROW
You wrote that you had trouble
sleeping

NELL

Yes because someone was always
keeping me awake Ever since I
was little That was my job I
took care of my mother and I had
to be there for her all night
long and she woke up all the
time And after she died well
its been a few months but I
still I still wake up its a
habit

(beat)
I know weve only known each other
a couple of hours but Im really
glad to be with people who let me
talk about this Im really happy
to be here with you

Silence The others are embarrassed by her sincerity Shes
right
Nell is not of their world

MARROW
Were glad youre here

He says this with enough sympathy for Theo to see his interest in
the girl in the thrift shop dress
MARROW (contd)
Why dont we move to another room

INT RED PARLOR - NIGHT

The HARP sings out lively expertly played by Mary Theo Luke
Todd and Nell are impressed with her skill

MARY
Its an Erard Late 1870s

She plays and as she does shes aware of the room and the
house

and she sees something in a curtain or the fireplace or a
window

something at the edge of perception She suddenly stops

NELL
Whats wrong

MARY
The harp is out of tune

She finds a key and begins TIGHTENING the strings -- as Marrow
bangs

open the door briefcase in one hand CELL PHONE in the other
He

cant conceal his irritation Marrow removes folders from his
briefcase passes them around while she plays Nell again
studies

the Cherub of Death on the spine of the leather bound books

MARROW
Ill have to count David Watts as

a no-show So lets start Thank
you Mary

That was a little abrupt she feels it Everybody finds a chair
or

spot on the sofa Mary remains on the stool by the harp Marrow

sits in a large winged-back chair

MARROW (contd)
All right So to answer your
earlier question Todd why are we
here What do we all need in
life what are the basics We
need food we need water we need
sleep Sleep All of you resist
it Why What does that mean
Why do we resist sleep My field
of study is the individuals
psychology of emotion and
performance

LUKE
So why did you need the Addams
Family mansion for a scientific
test

MARROW
I thought it best to be isolated
to be in a location with a
definite sense of history and I
wanted to make sure that it wasnt
so pleasant youd all sleep too
easily Youll be taking a
variety of tests none of them
harmful and youve got the house
the grounds and each other to
keep you company

THEO
When do we take the tests

MARROW
Every day Basically well be
hanging out together like we have
so far this evening

Nell and Theo are looking through their folders sheets of paper
bizarre geometric puzzles

MARROW
Also there is no phone service to
the House and no TV I have the
cell phone for emergencies Well
begin the tests after breakfast
tomorrow

The others shuffle through papers Nell and Todd intent on them
Theo interested but not overly so Luke bored

MARY
Dr Marrow what is this house

When she says this we should be seeing her from an odd
perspective
the houses POV

MARROW (contd)
There was once a king who built a
palace The Kings name was Hugh
Crain A hundred and thirty years
ago when the Merrimack Valley was
the center of American industry
Hugh Crain made two hundred
million dollars Thats forty-
three billion dollars in todays
money He could have anything he
wanted And what he wanted was
Rene his bankers beautiful
daughter Rene and a house
filled with children

NELL
All the carvings

MARROW
But theres a sad catch to the
story

MARY

What happened

MARROW
There were no children Rene
died and then Hugh Crain built
all of this and then he died
His heart was broken

Nell shifts looks at the house with a strange feeling

NELL
Thats so sad

This has been tense between them a gunfight POP A LOG in the
fireplace makes everyone jump Theo relishes it but Nell
shudders

MARY
I think theres more to the story
This house has its own music
Doctor Marrow I can play it for
you I can hear it

Mary plays channeling unholy music from the house from the
walls

from the curtain from the air Her fingers fly down the harp to

the THICKEST WIRE and --

-- TANG Like a steel whip the wire SNAPS

Mary SCREAMS in pain
She

hand

MARY
My eye oh my eye my
eye oh No

The others leap up in shock Blood lines the wall behind her

clutches at her eye more blood spilling out from between her
fingers

TODD
Oh Jesus

Marrow and Theo rush over to her as she shrieks in pain
Todd is frozen pale like hes about to be sick Nell turns the

OTHER WAY but not because shes scared -- shes searching for a
shot glass on a side table

Marrow wraps Mary in his arms Her shrieking becomes a terrified
but quieter wail

MARROW
Mary let me see your eye

Nell appears by his side with the glass Marrow pries Marys
from her face
Blood flows freely from the eyelid but her eye is intact
NELL
Here cover it Dont let her
touch it

EXT HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

Marrow slams the door on the passenger side of Todds car Mary
sits there moaning glass covering her eye blood spilling out
around the edges Luke is on her side of the car

LUKE
Keep your head back thats it

Todd opens his door Marrow hands him a key
MARROW
Heres my key to the gate Call
me the second you know anything

Todd takes it jumps in The two men watch the car drive away

LUKE
That could have been worse

MARROW
Yeah

As they turn back Marrow taps Luke

MARROW
Luke can I talk to you

LUKE
Sure
MARROW
Because well I know I can
trust you
LUKE
Why
MARROW

Ive read your tests
That was half a joke and both men smile Now theyre bonded

MARROW (contd)

Theres something I I didnt
tell you everything about the
house and about Hugh Crain but

Im asking you not to repeat it

LUKE
I can keep a secret

They go in The house is outlined by the sky and clouds and the
moon

INT MEZZANINE - NIGHT

Luke catches up with Nell and Theo as he reaches the mezzanine

The
painting of Hugh Crain barely visible in the shadows looms
right
behind
LUKE
He said that Hugh Crain Hugh

Crain was a monster He said that
he was a brutal horrible man He
told me that Crain drove his
workers to early deaths Crain
had children chained to the looms
in his mill And listen to this
his beautiful Rene killed herself

THEO
And why didnt Marrow tell us
Doesnt he trust women That
fuck

NELL
(shes thinking
about the story
not Marrow)
A monster But he built this for
the woman he loved like the Taj
Mahal

THEO
The Taj Mahal wasnt a palace it
was a tomb Why didnt he tell
us

LUKE
Hes trying to protect the
experiment Personally I dont
think hes got a large enough
sample for valid results but as
long as the moneys good and the
food is good Im in

He heads off Theo turns to find Nell staring at the animal
heads
on the stairs Theo touches her She starts

THEO
Nell it was an accident

INT MARROWS BEDROOM (PART OF CONFUSING ROOMS) - NIGHT

Marrow sitting at a desk speaks into a digital voice recorder
His voice is cold analytical

MARROW
Icebreaker exercise conducted over
dinner Observed initial bonding
among subjects and experimenter
After dinner first bland history
of House relayed Nell appears
most susceptible to suggestive
history Luke who tested at the
bottom of the Levy-Mogel
Confidence Reliability Scale was
given the second part of the
story We should see some results
tomorrow Accident with harp
while unfortunate complements
the experimental fiction

He turns off the machine and then he says ruefully

MARROW (contd)
Publish or perish

He turns off the light The shadows in the room are too much for
him He turns the light on and then pulls the blanket over his
head

INT NELLS ROOM - NIGHT

Nell finishes putting things away in drawers Theo watches
leaning

in the doorway Nell looks around at the room and this is her
new

familys new home Theo smiles sweetly at her comes over An

awkward moment as the seriousness drains away

THEO
Ever try putting your hair up ina
French twist

Theo reaches for Nells hair Nell pulls away Theo pauses
Nell
realizes she shouldnt have pulled back

NELL
Sorry Im not used to being
touched

She moves closer to let Theo examine her hair Theo takes Nells
hair holds it up in a French twist

THEO
Youve been out of the world for a
long time havent you

NELL
Yes Ive missed it

THEO
No The world has missed you

Cautiously Nell peers in a mirror at herself and likes what
she
sees Theo lets Nells hair drop Theo moves for the door
NELL
Good night Theo

THEO
You too Happy tossing and
turning

INT NELLS ROOM - NIGHT

As Nell steps OUT OF FRAME and starts undressing the CAMERA
finds

the carved mantle the densely-packed scene of children at play

their faces frozen in dark wooden smiles their eyes blind but

staring OC where we sense Nell changing

Now in a long tee-shirt Nell crawls up onto the high bed Its
headboard is heavy dark engraved with fan-like shapes maybe

plants

She draws the covers about her and peers up at the ornate
headboard

Something about it bothers Nell but she cant put her finger on

it
She twists over on her side and turns out the light on the
nightstand For a moment all there is in the darkness is her
breathing --
INT GREAT HALL - NIGHT
-- then almost silence We pull back from the CHILDRENS FACES
on

the doors of the Great Hall to reveal the vast room standing in

darkness Covens of strange shapes consort in the shadows
things

that in the day would be lamps the stuff of life But now at

the
very deepest limit of human hearing it is as if SOMETHING
EXHALES

INT GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

It is black at the top of the stairs The carved animal heads on

the balusters are all turned UP THE STAIRWAY eyes starting in
fear

Waiting for something to walk down out of that blackness

INT HALL OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT
Eyes Eyes of all the mythological figures STARING down the

long
black hallway Awaiting something Afraid
At the end of the hallway where all eyes are staring the double
doors the ones that scared Nell and Theo stand shut

That something gathering at the edge of our hearing RISES Rises

as
if the House itself is breathing
INT NELLS ROOM - NIGHT
BUMP The sound thuds the stillness of the House Bump Bump
Bump Deep hollow distant like a dream Nell sits up still
asleep body moving by reflex
NELL
Coming Mother
WHUMP The noise jars her consciousness lighting up her mind
VERY
REAL Nell remembers where she is
Bump bang Its coming from somewhere far off in the House
Nell
listens in cold dread
THEO (OC)
Nell
Nell spins to the bathroom door goes through --
INT NELLS BATHROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
-- the unlit bathroom slamming the door to her room behind her
across and out the other door --
INT THEOS ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
-- into Theos room THUMP BUMP BUMP Nell finds Theo right in
front of her hair wet kneeling in the bed clutching her covers
to
herself
THEO
What is it
The sound grows nearer Out in the hall Like something
searching
Coming toward them
Nell lunges at the door Theo grabs to stop her and Nell sees
the

door is DEADBOLTED Theres a RUSHING sound on the other side of
the tall door Right there Nell freezes BUMP BUMP

THEO (contd)
Nell

Nell recoils to Theos side drags Theo out of bed to the corner
of
the room

Nell and Theo stare out AT US in terror BUMP BUMP BUMP
BUMP

Nell and Theos eyes travel over the walls following whatever it

is
which now seems to be moving out here in the theater
The SOUND moves along the wall to the right reaching its loudest
as
it crosses the back of the theater then seems to come down the
left
side
Theo shivers Nell clutches her close Nell writhes unable to
stand it any longer She jumps up
THEO (contd)
Nell
Nell charges the door screaming
NELL
No
SILENCE The bumping goes dead Nell blinks looks back at
Theo

But Theo is looking at her hands

THEO (contd)
Cold Oh God Feel it

She looks up in horror at Nell Their breath FOGS in the air
Nell

holds her hand up in front of her and as we watch HER HAIR
PRICKLES

UP GOOSEBUMPS WITH THEM

Her eyes turn up to the door and BAMBABAMBAM BABBA BAM The
DOOR

JARS in its frame leaping from the blows of whatevers on the
other

side
Nell backpedals but slips on the rug falls there on the floor
right

in front of the door Theo SCREAMS

Silence The BANGING stops With a RUSH whatever is outside
the

door is no longer there

Nell looks at Theo

Then Theo looks at the bathroom

Nell starts for it grabs Theos door but its designed to be

locked from the BATHROOM SIDE Nell looks up --

INT NELLS BATHROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

-- and takes a step into the pitch-dark bathroom Theo appears
in

the doorway behind her Across the bathroom the door to Nells
room
is closed Nell dashes for it --

-- but A SUDDEN SCUTTLING SOUND stops her dead On the other

side

of the door Rasping over wood Like a thing without hands
trying

to turn -—

-- THE DOORKNOB A long beat The metal creaks as something
takes

hold of it on the other side

Nell mouth open in cold horror sees the deadbolt Its open

Shes in no-mans land too far from the door to lock it too
close

to run

The doorknob TURNS but just as the door starts to open NELL
FLAILS
FORWARD AND SHOOTS THE DEADBOLT HOME

The door jams against it Nell jumps back Theo grabs her back
into --

INT THEOS ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
-- her bedroom and slams the door A long deadly silent moment

NELL (contd)
Its in my room
just

them

the

sign

Nell

the

him

But their BREATH no longer fogs Theo seems to notice the fact
as Nell starts for her room and KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK Behind
At the door to the hall

LUKE (OC)
Hey I heard screaming

THEO
Luke

She grabs for the door and lets Luke in

INT NELLS ROOM - NIGHT

Nells room stands silent dark The door to the bathroom is
The lock slides open The door swings in Luke stands there
two women behind him

Luke turns on the lights The room is perfectly ordinary no
that anything has been in here The door to the hall is shut
reacts

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Nell and Theo wrapped in blankets sit over mugs of tea at the
kitchen table Marrow across from them clicks off his digital

recorder Luke paces behind the women

NELL
You really didnt hear anything

Marrow takes his glasses off Luke looks at him then goes to

kitchen sink He turns both faucets on full blast and leans up
against the sink arms folded Theo and Nell turn to look at

A beat And then

BUMP Bump bump Its the sound Luke goes over to the door
pushes it open

LUKE
Oh look There he goes ol Hugh
Crain

INT GROUND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
as

to

VARIOUS SHOTS as the bumping seems to travel down the hallway A
rushing sound with it Theyre the same sounds from the scene
before but somehow have none of the impact none of the presence

they did in Theos bedroom
INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Luke lets the door shut turns off the faucet The sounds of the
plumbing die away

LUKE
Do you need me anymore Cause Im
going to bed They can stay up
talking another 45 minutes if they
want but I gotta try to get some
sleep

MARROW
Go ahead

Luke leaves the kitchen Theo and Nell watch him go
THEO
If this was some sort of joke Im

going to kill him

NELL
You know it wasnt a joke Theo

Marrow watches the exchange closely

MARROW
The cold sensation Who felt it
first

NELL

Theo I think Youve asked us
that three times Doctor Marrow
Whats going on

MARROW
How do you feel about Lukes
suggestion that it was just the
old plumbing Water hammer
something like that

Theo and Nell look at each other in frustration But Theo tries

get her mind around the question
THEO
I did just take a bath
know

INT THEOS ROOM - NIGHT

The room is a lot less frightening now
lights

I dont

especially with the

on Nell sits on Theos bed Theo looks at the walls silent

normal

THEO
I did just take a bath

When Nell doesnt respond for a moment
her

wrestling with herself

NELL

Theo turns to her sees

Mother always banged on the wall
when she needed me The night she
died I heard her but I
pretended I didnt I was just so
sick of it all And then the
banging stopped And in the

morning she was dead

This is

the first Ive ever said this to
anyone That was the job I had
Theo its the only job Ive ever
known and I failed Im actually
a bad person Theo The world

doesnt need me

Theo shakes her head brushes at her eyes The confession on

the

top of the fright has moved her deeply

THEO
Oh Nell Eleven years

With all

due respect to your mother who Im
sure was a saint Id have called
Doctor Kevorkian if not for her

for me

Its such a horrible thought it makes Nell smile and they share

tearful laugh
INT NELLS BATHROOM - NIGHT

Nell stands in the door to her room
NELL
Good night Theo

Nell shuts the door Theo is about to close her door but
hesitates She puts on the light and goes to the tub She turns

it

on waits Just the sound of the water And no bumping

INT NELLS ROOM - NIGHT

Nell lies asleep under her sheet the blankets off the end of the

bed HOVERING OVER HER on the headboard the carved faces of

children peering DOWN

FLAP FLAP flap The fan-light at the top of the window right
next

to the bed is OPEN a crack The sheer curtains flap listlessly
ina

gentle breeze The flapping grows louder and with a sudden gust

the curtain BILLOWS OUT In its flowing form we sense the SHAPE
OF

A GIRLS FACE fleeting so insubstantial we know we just saw
her

but maybe our eyes are playing tricks on us

The CURTAIN blows straight out touching the bedposts at the foot
of

the bed and there the wind catches the fabric hanging from them
The Wind seem to sneak under the bedcover and the shape
follows

Nell sleeps oblivious the WIND filling the room stirring the

tinkling crystal beads on the candelabra The shape of the
little

girls face now travels underneath the bedsheets toward the
pillows

toward Nell

Nell turns restless the AIR catches the edge of the pillowcase
and travels towards Nells face And for a split second there is

lifelike IMPRESSION OF A SMALL GIRLS FACE Nell almost awakens

The crystal beads stir and in their tinkling in the sigh of
wind

we hear

GIRL VOICE
Find us find us Eleanor

Nells eyes open And like that the pillowcase deflates the
air
rushes up the curtain to the window and is gone
Nell sits up looks about her Everything seems normal Just
her

sheets just the curtains but on the headboard remain the carved

faces Benevolent Nell settles back down on her pillow with a

sense of peace

INT DINING ROOM - DAY

Morning sun filters in through heavy drapes falling on Marrow at

the dining table Nell squeezes behind him and the sideboard
behind

him to get at the coffee Nell wears MAKE UP badly applied and

her HAIR IS UP in a French twist

NELL
Sorry

MARROW
For an American you do a good
imitation of the British at their
most apologetic
(Veddy British)
Pardon me Excuse me sorry
sorry

Nell smiles Theo walks in the door sees Nell and Marrow Nell
squeezed in behind him

NELL
Am I that bad

Theo is aware of Marrows curiosity and fascination with Nell
Theres a jealousy brewing

THEO
Well this is a cozy breakfast

MARROW
Good morning Theo Luke

Luke comes in behind Theo tired-looking also He goes to the
sideboard starts helping himself to breakfast

LUKE
After I went to bed the second
time after the noise I had
the best nights sleep of my life

Anybody

Marrow slept badly we can see it in his eyes
NELL
Yes I feel realy rested too

Theo

THEO

But she means exactly the opposite Marrow looks over Nells
hair

a

chair next to Nell digs into breakfast Theos face turns into
an

artificial smile

THEO (contd)
Your makeup too

Nell sits there flustered Marrow senses the jealousy isnt
quite
sure what to make of it and intervenes

MARROW
Eat your breakfast Theo then
well get started on the tests

INT GREAT HALL - DAY

CLOSE ON the complex PUZZLE of a field-cognition test Nell

scratches solutions erases and finally looks up in frustration

She sits alone tiny in the murk of the vast vaulted Great Hall

The enormous chimney occupies half the wall on one side of the
room

Clusters of furniture -- overwrought chairs with animal heads

splay-footed coffee tables limbed lamps -- huddle in strange

silent covens throughout Nell in a plush chair lays the work
on

a table beside her The CLATTER of stone on stone makes Nell
look

up

The fireplace looms just beyond her cluster of chairs large
enough

for a man to stand in A piece of mortar must have come loose

Nell stares at the chimney And a VOICE lets out a loud groan

Nell JUMPS She pops out of the chair It came from another
circle

of furniture in the shadows A figure stands and comes over
Its
in

table

Luke stretching

LUKE (contd)
Ive been thinking about these
carvings Kids Lots of kids
Fat little angel kids Wild kids
Kids with furry animals

NELL
The children The children Hugh
Crain built the house for The
children he never had

LUKE
Come on These are the typically
sentimental gestures of a depraved
industrialist

He puts his hand on a CHAIR the back of which is heavily carved
the motif he just described
Nell turns him an appalled look
LUKE (contd)
Theo was working in the dining
room Shes probably done by now

You finish

NELL
Couldnt get the last ones You

LUKE
I did okay

Nell looks at the test tries to digest this

LUKE (contd)
We could do this stuff anywhere
I dont know what hes up to yet
But like I said thats the fun
It has something to do with this
environment

Luke just smiles rises Well see

He walks off his footsteps echoing in the vast room The door
shuts after him

Nell sags in her chair Then something catches her eye Ona
opposite a SET OF KEYS Nell goes picks them up Car keys
house

keys Must be Lukes She pockets them thoughtful but just as
she does --

-- something MOVES in the fireplace So fleeting Nell can barely

see it and we only catch a frame of it But the iron MESH
CURTAIN

hanging in front of the hearth is STILL SWAYING

Nell stands there FROZEN The massive fireplace LOOMS before
her

like a monstrous mouth black as pitch beyond the black metal

curtains

The swaying metal scrapes over brick floor Its eerie
repetitive

screep cutting to the nerve

Nell sits paralyzed rooted to the chair SCREEP SCREEP
SCREEP

A SINGLE STRAND of NELLS HAIR stirs toward the fireplace and --
-- SOMETHING INSIDE THE FIREPLACE MOVES BEHIND THE MESH

Nell CRASHES back over her chair knocking over a lamp and table
tripping stumbling out of the furniture

Holy shit Whatever moved in there was real Big dark like
somethings head It goes out of focus and we cant see it as we
follow --

-- NELL flying away across the room in headlong terror

INT FOYER - DAY

Nell slams out of the room skidding as the door slams behind

her
She sways up off the floor to run --
-- right into Marrow and Theos legs Nell aborts a scream
realizing who it is Theo stands there in surprise holding
papers

in her hand

NELL
Theres someone in there Theres
someone in there in the fireplace

INT GREAT HALL - DAY
Nell and Theo stand behind Marrow and Luke across from the
fireplace Theo glances at Nell Nell is shaken

Marrow nods to Luke and they start forward together Marrow

among

the furniture to the left Luke down the right side

The iron screens hang silent in the fireplace black

impenetrable

Marrow and Luke come up on either side Luke ducking this way and
that trying to get a glimpse through the mesh

They stop before it neither breathing both listening Marrow
steps forward and pulls one screen aside far enough to look in
DARKNESS

Nell and Theo watch apprehensive

NELL
Jim

Marrow sticks his head into the fireplace For a long moment
nothing happens

IN THE FIREPLACE pitch darkness Marrow feels up the chimney

AND THEN SOMETHING SWINGS DOWN RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS FACE

Marrow

doesnt flinch

He FLINGS back the screen revealing the only things in the
fireplace two massive andirons and the still-swinging FLUE

cast-iron forged in the shape of a LIONS HEAD

Luke throws back the other screen Theo comes over Nell

follows

Luke

Theres nothing else in the fireplace

Luke and Theo stare at Nell Marrow squats to study the hearth
The large iron ASH-DROP is coated in soot

Not a mark on it He opens it Inside a glimpse of ASHES and
CHARRED WOOD Marrow stands looks at Nell

NELL (contd)
Somebody was in here I saw him

Marrow looks at her not sure what to believe Nell turns to

and Theo for help Not from that corner Then Nell remembers
reaches into her pocket and produces the KEYS She holds them up

to
Luke
NELL (contd)
Are these yours I found them
right over there
LUKE

the

INT CARRIAGE HOUSE - DAY

Light filters in through gaps in the wood Luke opens one of the
main doors with a loud SQUEAK the sun revealing a TARP-COVERED
SHAPE a carriage Unused in a hundred years A row of tarp-
covered carriages fill the stalls into the distance

LUKE
Well this lot is full

THEO
He must have left Didnt like
the looks of the place or

something

NELL
How could he have left without his
keys

THEO

Two sets I dont know Maybe

LUKE

house

As they leave the CAMERA LINGERS on a covered shape in one of

stalls SMALLER than the other carriages it could be a car A
broken wagon wheel leaning against it

the door choking covering her face
Theo smells it The women are both sick from the smell
THEO (contd)

Marrow comes into the hallway He sees them from a distance

ON the two women

an answer)

NELL
No its getting worse
MARROW
Nell Whats wrong

NELL
That smell oh God

Theo blanches looks at Nell She smells it too and in mirror

image fashion backs away from the doors also Marrow notices the

exchange and watches them intense And then in a heartbeat
the

moment is over

EXT VERANDA - DAY

The RED LIGHT on Marrows DIGITAL VOICE RECORDER blinks The
device

is in Marrows jacket pocket CONCEALED from Nell Theyre
sitting

in Adirondack chairs on the long veranda behind the House
Marrow

beside her observes

MARROW
What did it smell like

NELL
It was very specific

MARROW
(so tell me)
All right
NELL

In the bathroom in my mothers
room the toilet was next to an
old wooden table It smelled like

that wood

MARROW
So smell is Smell is the
sense that triggers the most
powerful memories And a memory

can trigger a smell

NELL
I wasnt thinking about my
mothers bathroom

MARROW
What happened after you smelled
it
NELL
I looked at Theo She had a look
on her face

MARROW
Like she smelled it too

NELL
Yes

MARROW
And then what happened

NELL
I got more scared

Marrow thinks about this

MARROW
Hmm

NELL
Im sorry Im messing up the
study

MARROW

No youre not Something moved
you You saw something

Nell looks to him Hes sincere He believes her

NELL
I dont know Maybe I

Didnt she almost says She struggles embarrassed

NELL (contd)
I havent been with people in a
long time

Marrow settles in his chair looks out at the forest

MARROW
I really havent either

Nell peers at him doubtful Is she being made fun of

MARROW (contd)
I mean Im surrounded by people
day in dayout Students
colleagues
(beat)
But most of the time even when
Im with them you know Its
all about power theres not much
room for actually getting to know
someone or having someone getting
to know you

Nells face flushes with compassion With longing Marrow looks

at

her Hes vulnerable Needing She doesnt dare hope The
moment

lasts a few heartbeats

He looks away A flicker of distress crosses Nells face And
then

she realizes Marrow is looking at --

-- Luke

LUKE (contd)
You have to see something

INT GRAND STAIRWAY - DAY

Luke Nell and Marrow mount the stairs climb up and up They
find

Theo in the mezzanine staring at the wall at the painting She

turns and looks at Nell strangely

Nell confused turns around On the wall and the painting are
dark

stains Black Blue Runny Almost like something leaking
from

the roof has run down

Nell steps back The stains are the letters N and O Pulling
back

farther the rest of the word ELEANOR

NELL
My name

She follows the streaking substance up blinking in rising fear
as

more running letters appear The word WELCOME And higher up
the

last HOME

NELL (contd)
No

But the substance doesnt come from the ceiling
It is as if the oils on the PAINTING OF HUGH CRAIN have been
boiled

by a heat gun and blasted off running down from there Hughs
face

is gone In place of the face the underlying ivory of the
canvas

glares out like a skull

Nell SCREAMS and runs away the others calling out after her in

alarm As they vanish around the corner the camera tilts down
and

we discover smeared paint on the floor Smeared it seems WITH

LITTLE FOOTPRINTS in it

INT RED PARLOR - DAY
Nell panic rising in her voice confronts the others

NELL
Welcome Home Eleanor Welcome

Home Ive never been here Who
did this

LUKE
Its somebodys idea of a joke

She looks at all three of them

NELL
Who did this Why are you doing
this I dont know any of you
You dont know me Why are you
doing this to me

Luke shakes his head Theo starts getting pissed Marrow stands
there arms folded observing

LUKE
I didnt do it

THEO
You could have

LUKE
So could you Is this some fucked
up idea of art putting someone
elses name to a painting

THEO
No
NELL
Theo Did you

THEO
Maybe you did it yourself

NELL
Why

THEO
I dont know Youve been alone
for a long time maybe you want
attention
(pointing to
Marrow)
Maybe he did it

MARROW
I didnt You know that Nell

This is horrifying to Nell being doubted and accused of
something
so ugly if it were true

NELL
I dont know anything Whoever
did this please just just say
so just please this is

cruel Dont be cruel to me I
cant stand it You dont know
me

And she runs out
Nell grabs for the door to leave

She flings open the door MONSTROUS arms seem to grab at her
But
its only a wild-looking coat rack in the hall

EXT 2ND FLOOR BALCONY - DAY

Nell stands at the railing of a stone balcony on the houses
second

floor The air stirs her hair She peers up at the Houses

roofline its clusters of misplaced windows and other features
like

so many screaming heads

Chilled she pulls her sweater closer Marrow comes out onto the
balcony from twin French doors behind her
of

Beds

NELL
Are you coming to confess

MARROW
I wish I were I wish I had done
it then I could confess and youd
be at peace That great moral
philosopher Frank Sinatra once
said to someone he loved I wish
you had an enemy so I could beat

him up
She smiles
NELL
Lets say it wasnt you Who did
it
MARROW

dont know

NELL
t was a stupid thing to do

MARROW

NELL
(for the absurdity
of the idea)
Welcome Home

MARROW
Youll never see it again Mr
Dudleys taking care of it
(beat)
Im sorry Nell Can I show you
something youd like to see

NELL
(still too shaky
for enthusiasm)
Sure

INT GREENHOUSE - DAY

Marrow lets Nell into a long Victorian-era GREENHOUSE Its
overgrown lush the leaded-glass panes above stained with years

condensation and pollen Vines and trees climb up the sides

of flowers and plants line narrow footpaths of brick
Nell

Nell leans down to look into a WATER GARDEN with a STATUE OF A
bursting from the surface grasping for the air as if he had been
drowning A sudden rumble runs throughout the greenhouse And A

CAVALCADE of water comes out of the STATUES mouth surprising

She lets out a little yelp and then laughs with Marrow

Nell loves the greenhouse It takes her breath away
NELL
Oh its so beautiful

Nell makes her way among the plants She looks up at a TOWERING
DOUBLE-HELIX STAIRCASE which rises from the floor to a platform
which gives access to the roof Below the staircase are planters
filled with violets

NELL (contd)
Violets Somebody mustve died
here

And then out of the corners comes Mister Dudley

MR DUDLEY
Thats where she hanged herself

NELL

MR DUDLEY

Rene Crain Up there Rope
Ships hawser Hard to tie
Dont know how she got it

MARROW
Thats enough Mister Dudley

MR DUDLEY

She stepped off the platform
(he looks up with

a suggestive leer)
They had long skirts in those

days

MARROW
Thank you Mister Dudley
please

MR DUDLEY

House is full of stories If you
know how to read these things
its an open book Justa
different library than the kind
youre used to

NELL
Why

MR DUDLEY
Whyd she kill herself

NELL
Yes

MR DUDLEY
(what other reason
is there)
She was unhappy

NELL
Why

MR DUDLEY
Cant say Havent been here that
long
(hes off)
Well its Labor Day gotta get to
work

And off he goes

Nell looks up

Marrow watches her as she moves about

in

MARROW
Thats a horrible story

and smiles

MARROW (contd)
Youre smiling

takes a heavy

ripe bloom

hand lifts it to her face While she talks she walks and

Marrow
follows

NELL
I was just thinking how happy I am
right now All my life Ive been
waiting for an adventure And I
thought oh Ill never have that
adventures are for people who
travel long distances thats for
soldiers thats for the women
that the bullfighters fall in love
with And here I am and
something is happening to me
Strange noises in the night
Paintings are calling to me And
all it cost to get there was five
gallons of gas Im getting my
adventure

For the first time since weve seen Nell there is something to

her
which is simply erotic Marrow follows her down one of the
footpaths She smiles back at Marrow as he trails her She
reaches
a transept in the greenhouse and as she turns down it theres
the
slightest sway to her gait Marrow follows her around the corner
into the transept At the far end the wall is completely
overgrown
Nell looks up through the ceiling at Hill House looming grim
outside distorted in the old glass
MARROW
Someone is playing with you
NELL
Why
MARROW
I dont know
NELL
It doesnt matter Even if
theyre tormenting me someone
wants me What I do with this is
up to me I can be a victim or I
can be a volunteer And I want to
be the volunteer
Nell glances at him and for that split second she is raw
passionate woman She walks away the sway in her gait aching
powerful Marrow is surprised by what Nell just said and stares
at

her as she comes to the overgrown end Nell reaches out to the
hanging vines pulls them aside

and A FACE stares out Gastly White Nell takes an
involuntary step back a little gasp
The

The face is marble Blind eyes stare from stained cheeks It is
STATUE OF CRAIN Marrow comes over
Its an enormous stone tableaux of Hugh surrounded by cherubim

plants have attacked it as if trying to wipe its funerary

presence

pull

and

from the greenhouse

NELL (contd)
Hugh Crain Cant seem to get
away from him

She laughs a little at herself Marrow joins in He helps her
the plants back to reveal more of it

She reaches out touches the marble cheek Then daring grins
begins to hum her TUNE

Marrow steps back to watch her do a sensual slow-dance with Hugh
Crain pirouetting her hips sliding past hypnotizing Marrow

MARROW
What is that tune

NELL

I dont know A lullaby I guess
My mother used to hum it to me
And her mother before that and so
on

(to the statue)
Hugh Crain would you care to
dance

She hums another two notes and BANG The door behind her SLAMS
OPEN in a gust of wind jolting Nell She stops and stares
Outside the window through the glass she sees Mr Dudley

staring

Nell

turns

at her hes been watching her dance The spell is broken
embarrassed cant bear to look at him

A beat and then Marrow goes over and shuts the door When he
back --

-- Nell is just vanishing around the corner her rapid footsteps
echoing in the vaulted room
EXT REAR LAWN - DAY

Nell hurries away from the House across the rear lawn ashamed

at

herself as much as she is spooked

In the distance Mr Dudley is walking toward the House with cans
of

paint cleaner an a ladder Nell stops watching him He senses

her pauses and smiles

Nell reacts Sees the ladder Then Mr Dudley disappears into
the

House

Nell once again starts to hurry away but looking back over her

shoulder almost impales herself on the rusted iron fence of --

EXT FAMILY CEMETERY - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

-- the tiny Crain family cemetery Nell catches herself A
small

swinging gate bars the way She hesitates

Nine moss-covered headstones show the wear of a long century
Eight

small headstones one large one A half dozen unmarked stones in

the grass stillbirths

Nell is drawn into the graveyard The large stone is RENE
CRAINS

The smaller ones are her childrens

Nells heart is breaking as she moves among them the various
names

One reads ADAM CRAIN APRIL 5th 1874 -- The rest of the date
is

covered by growth She clears it away April 6th 1874

NELL
Only two days

There is an EPITAPH almost wiped out by lichens Nell kneels to
read it

NELL (contd)
The blest are the dead Who see
not the sight Of their own
desolation

Nell disturbed but not knowing what to make of it rises from
the
She

the

away

of

gravestone turns to the next ELISA CRAIN AUGUST 21ST 1878 --
clears it away August 21 1878 The blasphemous epitaph here
NELL (contd)
A fathers joy unjustly snatchd
by a jealous God
Nell is shaken and dreading what she will find next whirls to

one behind her WENDY CRAIN JANUARY 1 1880 -- She clears it

-- January 1 1880 And its graven commandment so familiar so
comforting now rings with terrible malevolent promise

NELL (contd)
Suffer the little children unto
me

There are three more grave stones and after clearing away the
brush they too show that the babies died after a few hours or a
day Theres the same symbol on the graves of the children a
cherub of death Weve seen this image before Nell backs out
the cemetery afraid

INT MEZZANINE - DAY

Nell hurries down the mezzanine to the doorway which leads to the
Red Parlor

INT RED PARLOR - DAY
She stands there a beat staring in at the volumes upon volumes of

books Nell is unsure of what shes looking for She looks at
Crains painting and recognizes the same Cherubs inside the

ornate

and

frame The background in the painting IS THE RED PARLOR Then
recognizes in the painting an OPEN BOOKCASE BEHIND CRAIN
Intuitively she turns toward the same bookcase across from her

is able to push it open Inside a small stairwell

INT CRAINS SECRET STUDY - DAY

Down the circular stairs Nell enters a very small dusty room
Velvet curtains drawn shut only a sliver of sunlight showing
through As her eyes adjust she makes out the furnishings of a

late-nineteenth century office Crains secret office

The bookcases filled with business ledgers The business ledgers
are stamped with the cherub of death
At the end is an enormous desk Behind it a massive carved
chair

covered with a sheet only its lion-head arm rests protruding
from

underneath Nell realizes its

NELL
Crains study

She moves for the desk An ENORMOUS MIRROR its silver inner

surface flaking with age tarnished reflects the room the desk

and FOR A SPLIT SECOND A SHADOW IN THE CHAIR Nell steps in
front

of it blocking our view

And when she steps past there is only the dim flaking image of
the
chair the natural shadow of the room

Nell goes around the desk stands over it The chair sits silent
behind her shrouded

On the desk sits a set of ledgers marked with mill names --
Lowell

Haverhill Manchester -- and years 1884 85 and so on She
flips

one open

THE LEDGER is a payroll account Names upon names of workers

rendered in sepia by Crains severe cursive Notations in the

column beside it indicate man woman or child and the
appropriate

wage for each class of worker Many of them at least a third
are

children

NELL reacts Disturbed by it She shifts closer to that damn

chair
behind her The sheet hangs over it in such a way that someone
could be sitting there under it

She turns the page Columns indicate pay and so on But one
column at the very center of the book hidden in the binding is
unlabeled Down the column some names have a line drawn through
them and at the end of the line a CROSS

Nell follows them back eyes searching across the ledger

She turns the page pushes the book down revealing that concealed
column more crosses And more Her eyes flick back and forth
The crosses are paired with entries for CHILD She looks their

We

lap

next

names
NELL (contd)

Erin Peter and Sean and Emily and

Elizabeth who are you And

you What happened to you You

died How did you die
Nell turns the pages More and more crosses Dozens Scores
Nell sinks down into Crains chair and tears come to her eyes
see the book
INT GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT
The painting is right there now The letters have been erased

INT NELLS ROOM - NIGHT

We see the ledger and pull back and the ledger is in Nells

Nell sits on the bed in her sleeping tee-shirt and undies Theo

looks at the book with her

THEO
Thats so sad

NELL
Theres hundreds of them This
must be a record of the children
who died at the mills like Luke
said

THEO
Before he painted your name over
Mister Crain

Theo hands her the bottle Nell takes it tops off her glass
spilling Her face is red She grimaces as she tosses back a

swallow

NELL
You really think it was Luke

Theo takes another swig She holds bottles of nail polish up
to Nells bare feet testing the colors

THEO
Well it wasnt me Mister Dudley
to

hes in charge of all the messes
so why would he make more work for
himself and

(beat)
You said the Good Doctor was with

NELL
(pondering)
I dont know what to think
anymore

THEO

NELL

on the head

Nell looks down her long legs at Theo

NELL
Im sorry I was mad at you Theo

THEO
Me too Although I learned one
thing about you that you dont
know about yourself You can be a
pretty decent bitch

Nell shoots down the rest of the glass of wine

NELL

She begins
brush

(beat trying to
sound casual)
In the city what kind of place do

A loft Thats a lot of room for
one person Probably Maybe
theres room for

Theo looks up understands what shes asking
THEO
You want to move to New York you

NELL
I dont know you know

Nell lies back arms spread lets the glass roll

out of her hand

Theo paints Nells toenails one by one carefully guiding the

strokes in along the skin Nell unused to this

gives into the

pleasure and Theo sees how easy it is to move Nell

THEO
My place isnt like yours Nell
it doesnt have a view of sea It
doesnt have a view of anything
Whats interesting about the way I
live is what goes on inside the
walls Living with me My
boundaries arent very well
defined Nell Do you know what I

NELLS ROOM - NIGHT

closes the door and sits at the vanity brushing out her hair

bed Her motions are languid in the light of the single
off-balance with the wine

HAIR brushes out in long even strokes The brush moves
lifting it and letting it fall

HE MIRROR the brush draws through Nells hair but as it

hair divides in its wake LIKE FINGERS RUNNING THROUGH it

freezes Shes not sure what she just saw She runs the

her head

and again it is as if something pulls it back from
Again -- fast -- she runs the brush through her hair and this

time

the hair SPINS UP IN A KNOT

Nell flinches dropping the brush knocking the shade of the lamp
on

the vanity a-wobbling

Shes out of the chair in a flash grabbing her own hair staring
at

the space behind her Nothing there A beat
She steadies herself feeling the alcohol Gets control
The Tiffany lamp rocks back and forth crystal beads shimmering

The light plays across the fireplace and mantle on the wall And
something there catches her eye

Nell feels her way across the room not sure of what shes
seeing

Over the sound of the wind outside theres something at the very

highest edge of hearing

She stops five feet from the mantle The swaying light catches

the

rich tones of wood Then darkens Illuminates it again
Darkens

The carvings of the playing CHILDREN in the wood SEEM TO MOVE

Nell stares in drunken fascination And as the first fear begins
to

rise in her throat the wind dies down and in its place there is
the

FAINTEST TRACE OF CHILDRENS LAUGHTER Nells reaction
changes

to awe

Tentative her hand goes out shaking and touches the mantle

It is hard and still No movement whatsoever Silence But the

FACES engraved in the wood all seem to be peering up at her
hands

outstretched for her hopeful

EXT HILL HOUSE GATES - NIGHT
The enormous LOCKED gates are silhouetted against the moonlit
sky

The chain is dangling in the wind

EXT HILL HOUSE - NIGHT
in

the

Hold on Nells WINDOW the light shining dim through the gauze
curtain It goes out The window stares from an arrangement of
other windows stonework and doors like an eye with a cataract
a face howling in horror

INT NELLS ROOM - NIGHT

Nell her breathing heavy lies tangled in her heavy blankets
asleep but restless Her feet hang off the end of the bed

In the bg the door to the bathroom is shut barely visible in
faint light from the window HOLD on it

Silently it begins to OPEN The gap WIDENS yawning pitch dark
beyond A long beat And then a THUMP A SLIDING SOUND

Something drags itself across the floor

BUMP SLIDE Our line of sight is blocked by the bed But the
sound is getting louder coming closer

Bump Slide Nell grinds her teeth in her sleep pulls the
blankets about her tighter Bump The sound stops And her

BREATH

oc

OPEN

and

Nell

BEGINS TO FOG

Whatever has just come in the room is right there hovering just
We can feel it

Without warning Nell BOLTS upright GASPING into consciousness

REVEAL nothing Just the dark room And the bathroom door

Nell stares at the-door knows she shut it Now its open She
breaths fast feeling the cold knowing somethings in here with
her

She stops breathing strains her ears Silence A long moment
Then she notices her feet hanging out from under the covers

They are black Feel slick Nell turns on the light by her bed
looks down

HER FEET ARE COVERED IN GORE Where Theo had been painting
SCREAMS

INT NELLS BATHROOM - NIGHT

SCREAMING Nell spins the tub faucets on full blast sticks her

into the spray

THEO (OC)

Weeping Nell scrubs the gore off her feet -- red black like old
clotted blood
NELL

Who is doing this to me
The door to Theos bedroom is shut The handle rattles urgent

THEO (OC)
Nell whats wrong Whats wrong

The blood or whatever it is on Nells feet comes off is sucked

THEO (OC) (contd)
Nell its locked let me in

Nell squatting in the tub sobs as her feet come clean and
are NO WOUNDS Theo rattles the door
THEO (OC)
Nell the door is locked Open
it
Nell rises steps out of the tub and looking like she could
moves for Theos door

She grabs the handle but realizes what Theo has been trying to

her all along its LOCKED Perplexed Nell finds the key in the
hole and turns it

The door rams open Theo behind it terrified and clearly just
awoken

THEO (contd)
Nell

Nell stares at her hair tangled tear-stained doubtful Water
splashes in the tub faucets still running
The LIGHTS flicker as one in the connecting rooms Theo has
to

look up at the bulb in the bathroom and they all GO OUT
Darkness

swallows them up Stray moonlight reflecting in the mirror

silhouettes them standing there

THEO (contd)
Nell the tub

time

Nell stoops in the darkness and the faucets squeak shut Theo

bumps

her way out of the room Nell moves to the doorway following her

into --

INT THEOS ROOM - NIGHT

-- Theos room Theos form moves by her bed and with a snick

the

her

cigarette lighter lights up Theo holds it above her head its
tiny

orange flame glistening off polished wood in the shadows Nell

steps toward her

Drip Drip From the bathroom Theos eyes widen

THEO
Oh God your breath

And sweeping over them a SHOCK OF COLD Their breath

Nell shakes her head dont say anything Nell turns around

darkness almost impenetrable SHAPES alien threatening at the

very edge of light -- anyone could be some thing Drip
Drip

THEO (contd)
Its here

Nell looks down at Theos bed then at Theo who moves closer

Nell Nell gives the bed a wide berth Together they back
toward

the wall with the fireplace

to

They stare out at us eyes trying to adjust afraid Behind them
looms the fireplace and in front of it a metal cage-like fire

screen A beat

BAM SOMETHING LUNGES out of the fireplace but is caught in the

screen hitting Nell and Theo in the back
Theos lighter goes flying in that very instant and we never see
whats hit the screen Neither do they Theo falls SCREAMING
Nell manages to whirl embrace the cage and slam it with

whatevers

inside back into the fireplace The screen JOLTS hard enough to
lift Nell

NELL
HELP

Theo still SCREAMING lying on her back before the fireplace

rams

her feet against it The screen HAMMERS at Nell and Theo They

cant run or itll get out

Theos screaming is suddenly drowned out by a HORRIFYING INHUMAN

SOUND from inside the fireplace

Theos scream goes dead in breath-stealing horror Nell
recovers

NELL (contd)
No Go AWAY

The screen punches out at them denting And then all the air in

the room seems to be SUCKED into the fireplace in one THUMP The

door to the bathroom slams

Its gone They sit there in the darkness panting

INT GREENHOUSE - NEXT DAY

Nell stares at the tableaux of Hugh Crain In the morning light
it

seems inert cold just a statue Luke and Theo enter Nell
doesnt seem to notice them until theyre beside her

THEO

Marrow said the same thing as last
night he says --

(meaning this is

on his now

doubtful word)
-- that he checked with Mrs
Dudley And he says that she told
him that all the fireplaces in the
West Wing connect to the main
chimney He says that he thinks
that the flue was open and with
the windstorm he says that what
probably happened was some kind of
freak air current --
NELL
-- What do you think

Theo considers then looks at her severe

LUKE

(lowers his voice)
Dont tell the Professor hed
probably throw me out But test
taking is one of the ways Ive
been supporting myself I
volunteer for every paid study
that they offer Of course
straight psych stuff doesnt pay
as much as the pharmaceuticals do
or a good wound study Check it
out

He rolls up his sleeve revealing large livid SCARS at intervals
too
regular to be anything natural

LUKE (contd)
A thousand dollars each Am I
sick Yes Do you know why I
only date freshmen By the time
theyre sophomores theyve
figured me out

THEO
(get back on track)
Mister very talky would you
please say what it is about this
study that bothers you

LUKE
The whole thing feels like
experimental misdirection Like
he says its about one thing a
psychological profile of
environmental effects on
insomnia and thatd be a
legitimate study but I think that
weve been subjected to an
academic bait and switch hes
really looking at something else

NELL
No No Jims not doing --
these things
But theres a desperate rising edge to Nells voice Theos in
response is quiet sober certain

THEO
Then who is Come on Nell Deep
down if you really thought it
wasnt Jim why wouldnt you be
leaving right this second Why
wouldnt you be afraid Really
afraid

NELL
Because I dont want to ruin
things Because home is where the
heart is

Theo is chilled by this answer which would only make sense to
someone out of her mind

Nell looks up and sees the double staircase at the end of the
greenhouse the one where Crains wife killed herself

And for a moment we see Crains wife hanging there and then the
image is gone

INT DINING ROOM - DAY

Lunch remains are on the table as Nell enters test papers in
hand

NELL
Jim Im done

But Marrow isnt there Shes about to go back out to look for
him
but sees something and stops

Forgotten by a reading chair to one side of the room Barely

visible Marrows BRIEFCASE Nell goes to the briefcase
knowing

she shouldnt look and unable to help herself Marrows digital

recorder glints out at her

Nell takes it out and presses play She looks up at the door
Any

minute he could come back in here and then Marrows voice
rings

out

MARROW (VO)
the hallway discussion about
last nights fireplace incident
concluded at three am Nell
continues her alienation of the
other subjects and the
experimenter It remains unclear
whether she truly believes she did
not deface the painting
Interview with the subject in
greenhouse yesterday to ascertain
the extent of her self-delusion
was inconclusive due to her
efforts to sexualize encounter
with experimenter

Marrows voice continues on in his assessment but Nell isnt
hearing anything anymore

She dies inside Her world upside down She falls into a chair
and all we can hear of Marrow is the cold analytical tone his
garbled jargon

MARROW (OC)
One minute

Its Marrow for real about to enter Nell clicks off the

recorder drops it into the briefcase Marrow is startled not

expecting Nell to be sitting right next to his papers and
briefcase

MARROW (contd)
Nell

She can only stare at him eyes dead Marrow looks from her to
the
briefcase and back

MARROW (contd)
Were you looking for me

Nell cant answer Marrow comes over unsettled

MARROW (contd)
How are the tests going

Nell rises staring emotionless Betrayal just beginning to
find a

hold She hands him her papers Marrow looks at Nell knows
shes

been in his briefcase He picks it up and with a final sorry

glance exits

INT GROUND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY
Nell emerges from the study stands there a beat lost Then she
turns resolute and starts moving Faster

INT GREAT HALL - DAY

Nell blinded by tears runs across the room toward the grand

entry

and the exit and stops

DOWN THE CONNECTING HALL out in the grand entry at the front
doors are Mr and Mrs Dudley Leaving for the day They stop
Look at her

Nell numb gazes from the open door to Mrs Dudley Mr Dudley
holds the door open as if in invitation Nell could walk out

right

now This is her chance But

Mrs Dudley smiles a knowing smile An all too knowing smile

And

seeing Nells decision gently shuts the door The LOCK CLICKS

Final Fate-sealing

Nell turns back to the House lost

INT RED PARLOR - DAY

Nell walks right up to the moveable bookcase and enters Crains

secret study

INT CRAINS SECRET STUDY - DAY

Nell sits in silence trying to find a feeling any feeling A
long

beat And without warning she leaps to her feet in SHOCKING
rage

NELL
How can he think Im doing this

She has a floor lamp in her hands and hurls it like a throwing

hammer at the nearest shelves Vases knickknacks and a LEATHER

ALBUM crash to the floor

She stalks around the room and then slows staring at what shes

done the rage draining out of her But if she could do
something

like that

NELL (contd)
No No I couldnt do those
things Im not making it up
She turns in place desperate and sees the old leather album
precariously tilting on one of the sprung shelves Its open

One

of the leaves flips over on its own gravity and the weight of
its

own pages TURNING IT

Nell approaches stepping over broken ceramic SLIP Another
page

turns

Nell hovers over it holding her breath so as not to make the
book
flip over and fall off the shelf in one instant

SLIP Another page turns The book is a PHOTO ALBUM of the late

nineteenth century bound with ribbons the aged Daguerreotypes
in

pressed vellum frames

Nell peers closer Its open to a faded gray image taken long

before it became the convention to smile for a photograph a
woman

RENE CRAIN sitting in a chair

And standing behind the chair a fearsome presence in a black
coat
his face hollow malevolent HUGH CRAIN

Nell shivers and SLIP the page turns on its own

An image of Hugh and Rene a look of deathly loss on their faces
The page flips

Crain hovers dark rage just under the surface but on Renes
face

is the faintest most inappropriate SMILE It sends a chill
through

Nell

The album begins to slide down the shelf and as it does PAGES

FLIP Renes SMILE grows wider her hair dishevelled her eyes
lit

with grinning insanity

Nell grabs the book just as it falls from the shelf

It is open in her hands to a picture of Crain alone in front of

the enormous fireplace in the Great Hall RENE IS GONE The
photo

is monstrous Nell fearful turns the page --
-- and REACTS to the last thing she expected A picture of a
lovely

woman filled with grace and power CAROLYN CRAIN Posed Ona

settee before the fireplace Beautiful beyond words Smiling

Ahead of her time

NELL (contd)
His second wife There was a
second wife Carolyn
It warms Nell
She turns the page Now Crain is there beside Carolyn But
there

is something different about him Less frightening

Nell flips the page again and now there is an image of Crain and
Carolyn Her hair is up in a FRENCH TWIST Nell smiles more

Nell turns the page yet again

But something is wrong It is another image of Carolyn and the
kinder gentler Crain but now it is Carolyn who is unsmiling

Another page Another Carolyns face darkening And in this
picture Carolyns stomach is slightly distended

NELL (contd)
She was pregnant

Nell TURNS PAGES FASTER AND FASTER and as she does Carolyn
SWELLS

PREGNANT before our eyes in ragged animation mouth working as if
to

speak voiceless as it is ELEANOR

Nell fumbles the book onto the floor It stares up at her open
to
the last page

It is an image of Carolyn Betrayal Hell Knowledge Her
hand

seems to be POINTING at the gaping maw of the GRAND FIREPLACE

Nell bolts from the room

INT GREAT HALL - DAY

Nell bursts into the Great Hall and stops At the far end of the

room broods the vast fireplace its chain curtains hanging like
the
veil to some hellish sanctuary

Nell stares at it daunted What is it that Carolyn is trying to
show her The fireplace beckons and Nell approaches against her
will

She finds a steel poker hanging by the fireplace and takes it

down

She uses it to slide one of the chain curtains open She steps
into

its soot-black mouth

Nell peers up the chimney A faint sigh of air She sticks the

poker up the flue scratches around Nothing

She turns her attention to the back of the fireplace thwocks it

Sooty stone chips away but its solid

The mechanism for the ash drop catches her eye Nell grabs the

heavy iron lever She pulls but can barely budge it It
finally

screeches back and the iron door in the floor of the fireplace

SWINGS DOWN

Nell looks in Two feet down it looks like a gray blanket of
ash a

charred timber or two sticking out Sick with fear Nell prods
the

ash Just charred wood

She thrusts the poker down deep It vanishes in the ash up to
her

hand CLACK She rakes through the ash CLACK And then she

feels the poker take purchase She draws it out and full of
dread

turns it to the light

Impaled on its hooks are TWO HUMAN SKULLS

Nell fights back the scream in her throat One of the skulls is
a

childs skull the other an IMMENSE SKULL with brooding brow

forehead crushed

Nell lets the poker drop It bangs off the door falls in the
ash

drop its handle hitting a spring Nell recoils as the trapdoors
SNAP SHUT like a pair of jaws

INT GROUND HALLWAY FLOOR - DUSK

Nell stumbles down the hall weeping in fear
NELL
Theo Jim Help

But instead she hears children voices calling out for her
INT CONFUSING SERIES OF ROOMS (THE MAZE) - NIGHT

Nell winds through the pitch-dark halls rooms gaping black left

and
right searching for the voices which seems to come from just
around
the next bend leading her around corner after corner
The hallways peel past Nell as she runs slamming through doors
ever darker The Houses hellish carvings glare as she passes
grinning taunting She rages on oblivious until she rounds a
final corner --
INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT
-- into the long dark hall leading to the LOCKED ROOM The
STATUARY peer down on her Dead faces Blind marble eyes As
she

turns the heads and eyes turn imperceptibly with her

For a frame or two the EYES are real just a subliminal glimmer
For the instant we try to catch the movement the illusion it

isnt

there It makes Nell stop She regards the terrible doors She
considers the labyrinth around her And begins to understand

NELL
The house its a maze thats
how you designed it didnt you
Mister Crain So wherever one of
your little guests went the house
brought them here Its designed
to make you come here But why

Another CRY comes from the far end
Nell eases down the hallway the fear welling back on her like a
tide She hesitates but then the CHILD-CRY forces her on She
reaches the CARVED DOORS with the wooden guard statues
NELL (contd)
Oh no Oh no no no

not that Oh no Ohhhhhhhhh

Gaping cold and stench hit her She gags
Now the CRY comes from under the door Present Real Right
there Nell shudders

The CRY grows louder desperate She shuts her ears to it The

CRY
rises to fearsome rage not sounding like a child anymore Not
sounding like anything human at all its painful Nell looks at
the locked room in horror and takes off running
INT PICTURE GALLERY - DUSK
Nell bursts into the picture gallery and stops Standing there
are

Marrow Theo and Luke stricken silent by her entry Looks of
shock

on their faces Nell just stands there A beat And then it
pours

out of her hysterical

NELL (contd)
He hunted all those children in
here The dead children Josiah
and Elizabeth and all of them
from the books he took them up
here he played games the
ones from his mills he burned them
up in the fireplace but she found
out what he did and she killed
him --

She takes a breath and turns gray Before anyone else can
react

her legs go out from under her and she lands sitting Theo and

Marrow get to her side fast

NELL (contd)
-- he didnt kill her she killed
him and ran away with her baby --

Marrow grabs her face Its gray her eyes glazing over

MARROW
Get a blanket

THEO
Its okay were all here

Luke races out Theo scared looks at Marrow

THEO (contd)
Whats happening to her
MARROW
Shes in shock Come on

He starts to lift her Theo takes her other side

NELL
After Rene after she killed
herself he turned into a

monster He did fill the house
with children he did but
they werent laughing

Nell is ugly sprawling in shock as Theo and Marrow shuffle her

to
a padded bench on one side of the room
THEO

NELL
Carolyn showed me where she hid
him hid him with all the ones he
killed --
MARROW
Nell please Nell take a
deep breath
NELL

Marrow grabs her face
MARROW

Luke rushes in with a blanket Theo covers Nell and then holds
her

gently

MARROW (contd)
Look at me Nell Look at me

Nell manages to focus on him her breath laboring
NELL
Hugh Crain Hes in the house

Hes still here

Theo pulls back goes very still The first hint of fear in her
eyes

THEO
No

Marrow sees the panic working on her gives her a stern look

MARROW
Theo You too Listen to me

The command derails Theos train of thought Marrow stares at
Nell

in pity cant bear it and has to look away Finally he turns
back

to her full of regret

MARROW
Nell you have to hear me Let me
explain whats happening to you
(beat)
Youre participating in a study on
hysteria

Everyone but Marrow REACTS

MARROW (contd)
Ive given you a powerful
suggestion that youre ina
haunted house I picked Hill
House because it fits the
expectations It was my it was
my theater my stage

Theo glances at Luke hes been right all along This was never
about perception

LUKE
Modelling small-group dynamics in
the formation of narrative

hallucinations You brought us
here to scare us Insomnia that
was just a decoy issue Youre
disgusting

NELL
Is this true Ive been
hypnotized

MARROW

I hadnt done a study of how group
fear affects individual
performance Mass hysteria is
Marrow shoots

Nell bucks in

like a story Nell A communal
story Someone starts it Then
we all add a little more to it
And then for some reason -- no one
knows how -- we start believing
it This story shapes what we see
and hear We interpret everything
through it make it fit the story
I started our story when I gave
you the history of Hill House
Youve added to it Thats what
this experiment has all been
about Thats what it was about
the experiments over Im
pulling the plug This is my
fault

NELL
Its not real Crain Hes not
real

him a look shut up

MARROW
Your fear of him was real Thats
all the ghost anyone needs

THEO
How could you do this to people

his arms furious desperate

NELL
This is real Im not making it
up Theo you saw it You were
there -- the banging and last
night You you all saw the
painting

THEO
Nell it makes sense It all
makes sense You and I we were

scaring each other working each
other up

NELL
-- but the painting

Nobody says anythlng The silence tortures Nell

NELL (contd)
I know you think I did that I
didnt Go to the great hall and
look in the fireplace

She starts to laugh Marrow gently presses Nell down tucking
the
blanket around her

MARROW
Why would we want to do that
Nell

NELL

Because thats where he burned
them up the child laborers from
his mills Because thats where
their bones are He killed
hundreds He took them here and
he killed them Their bones are
in the fireplace

Nell sobs The others exchange looks at this It sounds so
hollow
so delusional it makes Marrow look so right

MARROW
There are no bones in the
fireplace Luke and I looked in
it yesterday Theres some old
charred wood in the ash drop
but --

Nell SPASMS trying to fight her way up but Marrow and Luke hold
her

down Nell begins to wail in helpless rage

MARROW (contd)
Nell If we look in that
fireplace itll just make you more
upset And when there are no
bones there youll say they got
up and walked away

NELL
Oh God youre not going to
look

Theo pushes them back and grabs Nells hand gently brushes
Nells
face

THEO
Aw shhh Nell shhh
Theo turns up to Marrow intense furious with him

Nells hysterics have stopped She stares up at him lost
Searching inside herself Maybe she is crazy

MARROW
There has to be Monster in the
Labyrinth We make them up
Thats how we deal with the things
in everyday life that are too
terrible to deal with Like
losing someone Like being alone

Marrow reaches down to Nell but she shrinks away Theo blocks
Marrow out shielding Nell Marrow pauses disgusted with
himself

MARROW (contd)
Im sorry Nell Im really
really sorry I did this to you

LUKE
Sometimes saying youre sorry is
just not enough

A disgusted Luke leaves the room
INT NELLS ROOM - NIGHT
Nell lies in her bed shivering

NELL
Dont leave me

Theo spreads an extra blanket over Nell

THEO
Im going to stay with you until
you fall asleep And then Im
going to get some brandy

NELL
I dont think I want any

THEO

Theo spots a small candelabra with strings of crystal beads on
the
bedside table She lights the two candles
Theo goes and turns out the light Nell lies there watching the
flicker of the candles play in the crystal Eddies of heat

mingle
up the frost-covered glass of the window behind the candelabra
Small streaks of frost begin to melt We see eyes forming in
the

melting frost a face begins to form

Theo watches Nell There can be a TIME DISSOLVE Nell falls
asleep Theo tiptoes out of the room

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Luke eats chips Marrow stands by the door arms folded matter-

LUKE

MARROW

Awkward silence

MARROW (contd)
Where did she come up with it
How did she put it all together

LUKE
Is that the question of compassion
or science

MARROW
Its a question

LUKE
She got the child labor stuff from

Marrow nods gets his briefcase exits

INT GREAT HALL - NIGHT

Marrow steps into the dark vast room his glasses glinting The
faint outline of the fireplace on the far wall looms in the
darkness

Marrow approaches it The mesh screen is still open Marrow
stands
there a moment Then looks in

He squats and tries to open the ash-drop It doesnt budge its
jammed by the poker Nell dropped in

Marrow considers then shakes his head feels stupid for even
coming

in to check

Suddenly his CELL PHONE RINGS startling him

MARROW
Shit

phone)

INT NELLS ROOM - NIGHT

Nell lies in her bed asleep the room dark except for the last
guttering end of one of the candles It goes out

A FAINT SOUND LONG LOW like the inarticulate murmur of a
dozen
madmen Nell stirs Her eyes open She hears the sound

The wall on the opposite side of the room catches the pale gloom
from the window The twisting figures in the plaster the low-
relief the shadows they make seem to COME TOGETHER AS AN EYE
Black Not human The woodwork around it like some half-face

The GIBBERING begins to RISE

OUT OF THE CORNER OF HER EYE she can see a FORM beside her in the
bed

Nells mouth moves She manages to form words but its just a
whisper

NELL
Theo

Nell reaches out under the covers
Her HAND is suddenly grasped

THE EYE on the wall stares The babbling liquid deep voice
mounts and as the shadows move ever so slowly the EYE seems to
roam over the room

NELL (contd)
Oh God Its looking for me

And then the babbling stops Nell grimaces in pain She tries
to
look at Theo but its far too DARK right there beside her

NELL (contd)
Theo my hand Youre hurting me

In the place of the babbling another sound High-pitched
drawn-
out A CHILDS CRY Nell reacts

The cry wails louder coming through the wall Its a wail of
agony A wail not of this earth Nell struggles racked between
the pain in her hand and the tortured childs cry

NELL (contd)
A child No No Im right
HERE

The EYE focusses on her Dead on her Nell stops And with
sudden

violence shes WRENCHED out of the bed by whatevers beside her

Nell hits the floor with a scream She grabs at the table on
this

side of the bed pulling a lamp down on her yanking at its
chain

The room FLASHES into brilliance Nell stands up panting
There
is nothing in the room No Theo She looks at her hand

The eye on the wall is gone

NELL (contd)
Oh God Who was holding my hand
Nell snaps around There on the window SPREADING before her
eyes

the frost on the glass is melting into a HORRIFYING FACE The
face

of CRAIN

Nell recoils in prickling fear Living fear Then her fear
turns

to RAGE In the blink of an eye theres a heavy ashtray in her

hand and its flying at the window

NELL (contd)
I will not let you hurt a CHILD

The window BASHES out into the night the face vanishing with a
HOWL
of air

INT NELLS BATHROOM - NIGHT

NeIl explodes from her room a flying fury of hate The child-

cry

seems to race ahead of her into --

INT THEOS ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

-- Theos room which is empty Now it seems like its coming
from

the door to the hall is right there Nell races after it and --

INT 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY NORTH WING - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

-- barges out into the hallway She breaks into a run The cry

sounds from farther off Nell chases after it

INT NELLS ROOM - NIGHT

Theo carrying a pot of tea and some cups enters quietly just in
case

Nell is asleep She stops in surprise The window is smashed

INT CROSS HALL - NIGHT

Halls sprawl away into darkness in all directions as Nell tries

to

feel out where she is and realizes shes lost Just like Theo
and

she were before But now its night And shes alone Shes
been

tricked

Panting she stops presses herself against the wall Her breath

catches

Across from her is a MIRROR Herself reflected in its tarnished

surface But there is something wrong with it Nell steps
across

to it

Her reflected self begins to SMILE But SHES NOT SMILING Nell

writhes in horror but cant pull away from the mirror In it
her

GRIN WIDENS INSANE The bottom half of her face is someone
elses

BANG Nell recoils The sound breaks the spell knocking Nell
back

from the mirror

BANG BANG BANG Nell turns and runs

INT HALL OF PILLARS - NIGHT

The banging chases Nell into the hall of pillars Nell turns to

face whatever it is thats coming after her The BANGING

CRESCENDOES and then recedes still audible but like the
thing

following her has taken a wrong turn

Another mirror on the wall Nell glimpses herself in it This
time

her EYES are someone elses lit with insanity

Nell backs away through doors into --
INT HALL OF MIRRORS - NIGHT
-- the hall of mirrors Bang bang bang bang

The octagonal mirror-lined pillars cast and re-cast her

reflection
throughout the room Nell is everywhere in plain sight but

hidden

by the very infinity of her images The BANGING grows louder

NELL
Why do you want me

The BANGING ceases And then we see the real Nell standing

there

WHO AM I

She turns around Her REFLECTIONS all TURN with her EXCEPT
For a long moment we see it but Nell doesnt

And then she does

The REFLECTED NELL stands there hands hanging silent

Nell exhales in shuddering fear The Reflected Nell MOUTHS
compelling the real Nell to whisper with it

NELL (contd)
Welcome home Eleanor

With that the Reflected Nell grins and her STOMACH SWELLS before

eyes pregnant just like Carolyn Crain

NELL (contd)
No

Nell runs

INT HALL OUTSIDE GREENHOUSE - NIGHT

Nell races down the long hall bare feet flying covering her
from MIRRORS left and right She stumbles into --

INT GREENHOUSE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

-- the greenhouse where she slips on the marble She kicks the

shut behind her and lunges for the spiral staircase her horror
driving her up and up setting the rickety thing swinging We

what Nell hears the voices of children

VOICES OF CHILDREN
Help us help us

NELL
Im here Im here Im coming
to you Im coming to you

Nell climbs higher and higher into the dark reaches above

AS SHE CLIMBS through the greenhouse windows we see the night

sky
the clouds driven by the wind the moon old vines wrapped aroud
the
skin of the greenhouse and the shapes and shadows of the vines
seem to shift as if it was alive
Nell reaches the landing The stair case rolls back and forth
beneath her A beat And then BAM The door slams open below
MARROW (OC)
Nell Nell are you in here
Nell can only manage sobbing relief
LUKE (OC)
Look the stairs
Nell drags herself to the hand rail Marrow Luke and Theo rush
into view below
They all react to the sight of Nell at the precarious top -- with
her insanely happy smile They think shes there to kill
herself
Just like Rene Crain
They all freak out in a chorus of Nell No Nell
MARROW
Nell Dont move
Nell couldnt anyway She just grins madly tears running down
her

face Marrow grabs for the stairs but they shift under Nells
movement from up above

LUKE
Its not going to hold your
weight

MARROW

Just stay there Nell
Marrow mounts the stairs The metal support rods sing out under
his

weight And the whole thing pitches rolling around as he goes
up

Five feet Ten feet Fifteen feet up The sway gets wilder as
he

goes

At twenty feet with twenty more to go to reach Nell he stops
The

stairs buck sway out dizzily And then to his dismay he
realizes

hes on the WRONG SIDE of the double helix staircase

MARROW (contd)
Damn it

He straddles the rail to climb over to the other half

LUKE
Dont

The sudden shift is too much for the old stairs The support
rods

CREASE and then the whole enormous column of steel from where
Marrow

is standing to the ground BURSTS from its supports

Luke shoves Theo aside and the bottom half of the stairs spirals

out in a massive deafening COLLAPSE Marrows cellular phone
falls

out of his pocket and shatters in hundred pieces across the
floor

The top half of the stairs remains still hanging from the
ceiling
Nell grips the railing at the top

Marrow hangs there by one hand over the razor tangle of steel
below

He flails out for the other stairway swings himself over to it
It

takes a moment for him to realize he almost just died A moment
of

paralysis This is no longer an experiment No longer fun and

games

MARROW
Nell Are you up there

There she is Marrow forces himself to start climbing the shaky
stairs Luke and Theo watch from below tense
Then hes there Nell stands a mere arms length from him on the
other side of the railing

MARROW (contd)
Come on Nell You have to climb
over and step back on the stairs

Nell barely seems to hear him Instead she looks at the
DEFORMING

SUPPORT RODS around her We HEAR the voices of the CHILDREN

calling to her

MARROW (contd)
Nell Now

Theo on the ground calls up to Nell

THEO
Nell go with him Just go with
him

Nell refocuses on him and then gingerly climbs over the railing
She hangs there She looks down at the tangled steel below

NELL
The children want me Theyre
calling me They need me

MARROW
Nell You will come here now

Nell looks UP at him hazy

And THEN BEHIND MARROW the shifting clouds the moon the
vines

and suddenly all these random elements behind him form a dark

hideous face and in front of it a hand and the hand is rushing

forward to PUSH MARROW OFF THE STEPS

After we scream NELL SCREAMS

NELL
No

And as Marrow falls forward pushed by the force behind him Nell

grabs him he is caught on the rail As she has reached out
to

him now she has fallen into thin air and she falls towards
Marrow

and they hold each other She has a hand then a foot she
grabs

POP

the

his

lies

slips she holds on again and reaches the staircase She
on
A moments peace and then a new disaster with a metallic POP

POP the support rods spring from their anchors and the rest of

stairwell next to them drops to the ground in a catastrophic
shattering of sound

Marrow looks behind him

shoulder
open them

He looks back at her Her eyes are

MARROW
Were going down the stairs Nell
Im taking you down the stairs

He leads her go down the stairs

INT THEOS ROOM - NIGHT

Marrow and Theo stand in the doorway to the shared bathroom
watching
Luke finish taping a trash bag over Nells broken window

in her bed

THEO
She needs help

MARROW
Ill take her with me to the
University tomorrow I cant

like she was suicidal

LUKE
You used the wrong test

THEO

(indignant)

think shes suicidal and I didnt
have to test her Maybe she

exhausted

Nell

Luke

Maybe she really heard voices

Marrow looks away doesnt want to say this Theo reads the
feelings on his face

LUKE
Youre not telling us something

MARROW
Watts Those were his keys Nell
found His roommate called and
said Watts left when he was
supposed to I think hes here

THEO
Hes wandering around the house

it was ghosts Lets go look for
him again

MARROW
No If hes lost somewhere in the
house hell have to stay lost

until tomorrow until the night is
over What we have to do now is
be together with Nell

And they go Three scared people
INT NELLS BATHROOM - NIGHT

Luke sits on the closed toilet and watches Nell in the adjoining
room Light from the bathroom falls across her fetal curled

in the bed

The door to Theos room is open too Luke glances over Theo
on her bed Marrow is slouched in a chair

Luke settles back against the wall

The HOUSE EXHALES and the breath of the house is like the poppy
field in the Wizard of OZ it brings on sleep

INT THEOS ROOM - MUCH LATER THAT NIGHT
Marrow is struggling to stay awake and his eyes finally close

breathes hard in the grips of some awful dream
This is what the House wanted
INT NELLS ROOM - NIGHT

Nell lies asleep the ornate headboard looming behind her black
with its strange plant-like splay of leaves

Nell draws a deep sleeping breath and her EYES OPEN She
lies

there her breath still in her lungs not moving but sensing

something A long beat When she lets her breath out we can
see

it in the cold
INT NELLS BATHROOM - NIGHT

Lukes head rests solidly on the wall His eyes are closed
unaware
his breath is fogging too

INT NELLS ROOM - NIGHT

Nell lies there afraid to move afraid to make the faintest
sound

From the darkness above WOOD CREAKS At first it seems like
someone

is walking on the floor above But it is coming from within the

room

The CARVINGS on the ceiling the impossibly elaborate woodwork
ARE

MOVING Incredibly slowly with incredible subtlety turning
inside

out some of the forms lengthening some shortening Carvings

changing here changing there -- the ceiling coming alive -- with

some grand design we sense but cannot yet see

The wood grows out of the ceiling eating its way down into the
tall

bed POSTERS It crawls down the posters straining the sinewy

baroque curves swelling them

The CREAKING begins from the darkness of the wall opposite Nell

Nell inclines her head to see Out of the wall two enormous
BULGES

grow side by side

From behind Nell now The headboard GROANS its shapes moving
the
fan-like plant designs thickening and SPLAYING wide
Nell cant move her mind refusing to understand whats going on
The bulges in the wall DROOP to the floor And then we BEGIN TO
SEE they are like a pair of KNEES

Understanding starts to show in Nells eyes She looks up at the
ceiling And now all the movement the design behind the awful
transformation of the ceiling is clear

It is a HEAD A visage of madness of absolute horror eyelids
sealing shut its blind face

Silence Nells breath comes ragged Unable to speak but
trying
to call out

The EYES OPEN A SCREAM tears out of Nells throat
INT NELLS BATHROOM - NIGHT

Luke is shocked awake in time to see Nells room CONVULSE on her
just before the DOOR SLAMS in his face

LUKE
Oh my God

INT NELLS ROOM - NIGHT

The entire ROOM RAMS itself at Nell jolting her hard into the
headboard THUMBS FOLD OUT of the woodwork pinning her by the
shoulders against it As the room lowers itself toward her she
SCREAMS out of her mind

INT NELLS BATHROOM - NIGHT

Marrow lunges into the bathroom thrown from sleep as Luke stares
in
impotent shock Theo is there behind Marrow an instant later

MARROW
What is it

Luke cant make any words come out Marrow shoves him aside
grabs
the doorknob and thrashes at it

MARROW (contd)
Help me

He braces Luke up and then they lunge together shouldering the
door It splinters out of its frame --

INT NELLS ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)
-- and stumble into Nells room Marrows mouth opens Luke
stands

speechless Theyre stricken by the sight Nell SCREAMING held
by

the headboard as the deformed ceiling dips over her the room

THRUSTING at her rhythmically Nell and Theo make EYE CONTACT

THEO
Oh Jesus

Marrow recovers reaches out for Nell and the FACE in the
ceiling

turns on him The GAZE stops Marrow in his tracks He looks up

into it and knows its real Somehow it is Crain

Luke appears from out of nowhere on the other side of the bed and

SMASHES off one of the wooden hands with a large brass
candelabra

Nell screams in surprise but Theo drags her out of the bed

The head turns to them They flee Marrow backs away in awe and
fear

INT GREAT HALL - NIGHT

Luke and Theo drag Nell down the stairs into the Great Hall
Marrow

brings up the rear They retreat for the entry as Luke puts his

jacket over Nells shoulders Marrow stops looks back up the

stairs

MARROW
Wait a second Wait

All there is are the sounds of Nell Luke and Theo making for the
hall to the entry The House is silent

LUKE
No

Luke goes out But Nell pauses stopping Theo with her

The House is quiet Marrows hand still outstretched Nell
looks

around the room There are heads everywhere faces animal
heads

humans gods all staring from the woodwork the carpets
everything

All turning to her
Theo looks around but cant see what Nell is seeing Nells
breath
comes faster disoriented yet aware

NELL
Theyre all in here All the ones
he killed Theyre just children
We have to help them

THEO
(to Marrow)
Come on Why are we waiting

Even now Marrow cant believe what he just saw but Theos voice
brings him back He whirls grabs onto Nell helps Theo drag her
out

EXT HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAYGATE - NIGHT

Four cars sit behind the massive locked gate as far from Hill
House as possible Marrow paces past the fence staring out the
road beyond leading out of this place so close

Luke digs with a pen knife at the marble footing below the gate
No

easy way under it He stands and gazes at the razor-sharp spikes
twenty feet up Theres no way to climb this

THEO
Oh my God we need to call someone

Marrow just looks at her and walks back to Nells car

INT NELLS CAR - NIGHT

Nell sits in the passenger seat of her car wrapped in her
jacket

She stares out at the gate at Luke and Theo consulting Marrow

appears in the window

MARROW
You okay

Nell nods but theres something about her not right

NELL
Why did you bring me here

Marrow shakes his head doesnt fully understand

NELL (contd)
Why did you call me and tell me to
look in the paper for the ad

MARROW
Nell what are you talking about
I never called you

Nell stares dismayed but Marrow is dead serious

NELL
But you told me to look in the
paper You told me Id be
perfect

MARROW
Nell the first time I ever spoke
with you in person was the night
we met here

NELL
Then who called me

Hill House looms behind her windows forming eyes the carport a
gaping mouth

Nells dismay becomes a cold terrifying understanding and she
turns and stares back up at the House

Luke comes up with Theo on the other side of the car

THEO
Nell --

LUKE
-- how much is this car worth

EXT HILL HOUSE DRIVEWAYGATE - NIGHT

Theo pulls Nell away from the drive Marrow stands back from
Nells
car where Luke belts in behind the wheel

Luke eases the car forward to the gate He advances until the
cars

bumper makes contact And then without further ado REVS the

engine

The Buick grinds into the heavy steel bars The chain tightens
around the two halves of the gate but shows not the slightest

strain

INT NELLS CAR - NIGHT
Luke grimaces shifts into low pours on the gas
EXT MAIN GATE - NIGHT

The car fishes back and forth against the gate hurling a shower

of

gravel on the other cars off to the side of the road Marrow
Nell

and Theo move back

One of the Buicks headlights breaks The grill mashes in For
a

long moment the car struggles against the Gate No good Luke

eases up

Theo looks at Marrow Luke puts the car in reverse

LUKE
Get the hell out of the way

They back way up Luke vanishes up the drive in the car And
then

the Buick comes around the corner accelerating slicing down the

gravel road

INT NELLS CAR - NIGHT

Luke sits way back in the seat grits his teeth floors it
aiming

at the gate

EXT MAIN GATE - NIGHT

The car SMASHES into it and is STOPPED collapsing twisting
ina

deafening hail of steel and glass

The massive gate has BENT itself AROUND the car holding it in
its

steel-grip
EXT GATE - NIGHT

Nell understands the house will not let her go She turns away
from the gate faces the House mesmerized by the beauty in this
monstrosity The House is calling her back and Nell is drawn
towards it She starts walking

INT NELLS CAR - NIGHT

Luke gasps for the seat belt the wind knocked out of him

hes
looking back at the gas tank
Luke gets the seatbelt off tries to open the door but its
warped
shut He struggles to get out from behind the wheel Sparks
jump
from the battery Gas shoots out of the fuel pump onto the
shattered window He knows hes in trouble
THEO
Hurry The gas Luke The gas
Finally Luke gets free of the wheel Its agonizing to watch
The passenger door is jammed shut too
He squirms into the back seat The rear doors are in the same
condition as the front But the rear window is blown out He
crawls out onto the trunk
EXT MAIN GATE - NIGHT
Marrow hurries around the back of the car staying clear of the
lake
of gas spreading about it Luke rolls off Marrow helps him up
and gets him away a safe distance
LUKE
Im okay Okay Just my chest
Just my wind knocked out
Marrow looks up at the gate It is even more impassible than
before

with the gasoline-saturated wreck in it No way to try another
break-out either

LUKE (contd)
Sorry about your car Nell

He turns around The others do too
No Nell Luke and Theo look up Mute dread No Nell anywhere

MARROW

INT GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT

They stay to the outside of the stairs padding silently up

trying

down

the

to get a glimpse of the floor above Its shrouded in darkness

They turn at the landing eyes riveted to the top of the stairs
They start up

INT 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY NORTH WING - NIGHT
Marrow Luke and Theo pause at the top of the stairs and peer
both long empty directions of the hallway

Then Marrow turns toward Nell and Theos room The brass
candelabra in front of the open door

The rooms draw nearer closer Not even the sound of their
breathing

The door is ajar Marrow pushes it open with the tire iron The
room lies in silent disarray Normal disarray The bed normal
The ceiling normal No Nell

Marrow and Theo REACT and enter the room Luke lingers out in

hall a moment And just as he steps in after them we HOLD on the
long empty hall --

-- and a FIGURE glides across Far down at the other end She
disappears It was Nell

INT STATUARY HALL - NIGHT
Nell walks through the row of dark statues Carved faces watch
pass

INT HALL OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT
Nell stands before the threshold of the horrific doors once

locked

in

to

at

now inexplicably OPEN The mythological frieze on the door split

half a world cut in two a seal broken Like something has come
out of its tomb

Nell steps into the blackness

INT THEOS ROOM - NIGHT

Marrow comes out of the bathroom joining Theo by the window next
her bed Luke stands in the doorway

THEO

LUKE
(worried)

MARROW
Oh no

INT GREENHOUSE - NIGHT
Marrow Luke and Theo enter the greenhouse the heavy growth
forbidding in the darkness They spread out on the parallel

walkways

THEO
Nell

They reach the transept turn down it toward the statue of Crain
the end looming white in the dusk
Dead silence Then Marrow SCREAMS

Under a thin layer of ice underneath the giant hand that

protrudes

him

from the pond we find Watts body as if the hand wants to keep
there forever Marrow did find his Watts a horrifying sight

MARROW
Oh my God its Watts
As at the same time out of the mouth from the sculpture erupts a
river of blood scaring the hell out of them Their clothes
splattered with blood Marrow quickly leads them out of there

INT LOCKED ROOM - NURSERY - NIGHT
Nell stands there in the darkness sensing the expanse of the
room

turning and kicking something on the floor

It is a wooden toy train Then she sees a rocking horse by her
feet It is a NURSERY Turn-of-the-century

And as Nells eyes adjust as she tries to see what else is in
here

in the dark she begins to make out WHITE SHROUDED SHAPES

Against the wall A bed covered in a sheet A table beside it

HAND BELL A CANE

Just like Nells sick room at home Nell realizes it covers her
mouth

The furniture is in EXACTLY the same position though the sheets
covering the pieces are stained FAR OLDER

And on the wall something in a frame is covered with a piece of
sheet

Nell approaches it in trepidation and removes the cloth For a
long
beat all we see is her face as it goes slack Understanding

The framed thing is a stitchery It says A PLACE FOR
EVERYTHING
EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE

Just like the one at home
INT GREAT HALL - NIGHT
Marrow Theo and Luke barge into the Great Hall

THEO
Nell

LUKE
We cant stay here looking for
her She doesnt want to be
found
Marrow and Theo look at him Its what theyve been thinking
but

havent had the courage to say Theo stops suddenly Turns
around

The men notice and pause

Then they hear it Faint Floating down from upstairs
somewhere
Nells TUNE It doesnt sound right but its hard to tell as

its
coming from so far away
They look at each other start for the stairs
INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE LOCKED ROOM - NIGHT
Theo Marrow and Luke stand at the end of the dark hallway They
stare at the gaping doors to the nursery at the far end The
tune

is coming from within Abruptly it stops

And instead of Nells tune theres a repetitive CREAK CREAK
CREAK

n rising dread Theo starts forward

t takes Marrow and Luke a moment to come after her The
CREAKING
gets louder unnerving

fq

They get to the doors Theo first She pushes them wide

INT LOCKED ROOM - NURSERY - NIGHT

They stop there staring into the shadows

THEO
Nell

And there hunched over something turning a CREAKING CRANK of
some
sort is Nell

MARROW

Nell straightens from whatever it is she was doing and turns to
them Theo steps toward her afraid for her

THEO

LUKE
Come on Jesus Lets go

Marrow shuts him up with a vicious gesture stays back himself as
Theo approaches Nell

THEO
Lets go hon Dont you want to

where you can hear the buoy out in
the harbor when the wind is just
right

Nell smiles at Theo Shes holding something

NELL
Oh Theo You know I dont have
an apartment

THEO
Then lets go get you one

Nells smile softens even more Her voice is reassuring

NELL
Dont worry about me Theo Im
wanted Right here Im home

A CHILL of fear cuts through Theo as Nell looks deep into her
eyes

NELL (contd)
After all

(beat)
Im family

The thing in Nells hand is a NEEDLE the thing shes been
cranking

an ANCIENT PHONOGRAPH She lowers the needle to the spinning

record And HER TUNE the one she hums all the time begins to

play

The others are frozen where they stand Marrows mind reels at
the
implications of what hes hearing

MARROW
No
NELL
My mother used to hum this to me
Like her mother hummed it to her
And my great grandmother Carolyn
hummed it to her

Nell turns back The others stand there speechless

NELL (contd)

could explain it but youd never
understand

And that finally galvanizes the others into action Marrow
sweeps
past Theo grabs Nell hard and swings her for the door

MARROW
Come on

NELL
No --

THEO

Please Nell just see us out

Luke closes in on Nell with Marrow and theres nothing she can

do
but let herself be pulled along
INT GRAND STAIRWAY - NIGHT
Down the stairs they come Luke out in front now bounding down a
half flight ahead Marrow and Theo support Nell between them
Nell looks up at the hooded painting of Crain but is spun around
and taken down the next flight
INT GREAT HALL - NIGHT
Nell Marrow and Theo reach the bottom of the stairs and pause
Luke is halfway across the room looking back to make sure
theyre

with him --

-- and Nell digs her heels in jerking Marrow and Theo to a stop
She stares The others follow her gaze

Shes looking down the connecting hall out to the entry at the
front doors Theyre open

NELL
In the night

The DOOR BAMS SHUT with a concussion that rocks the entire room
sweeping Lukes jacket under it The HANDLES TURN LOCK DOWN

Stunned All stunned

A RUSH OF AIR The House EXHALES Silence And then CREEERAK
They cast their eyes back up the stairs

BUMP BUMP Far-off sounds hair-raising of infinite variety

over

down the halls

NELL (contd)
In the dark

Luke rushes from the room
INT GRAND ENTRY - NIGHT
Luke YELLS and throws himself at the front doors Marrow runs

to help him and shoves the tire iron between the doors and PRIES
Marrow throws the useless thing down and stands back

Luke joins him and they shoulder block it together But this
is MASSIVE Theres no way

LUKE
No you bastard Break

He roundhouse kicks it hurts himself

Theo afraid watches the Great Hall behind them Nell puts her
hand on her shoulder

NELL
Its not safe for you anymore
The children need me and Crain is
doing everything he can to keep me
from them

Theo stares appalled Marrow looks around puts his hand up to
shush everyone The HOUSE MOANS the BUMPING growing searching

MARROW
Come on

He rushes down the hall Luke right beside him Nell and Theo in
their wake
INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Lukes first barging into the kitchen Big windows all along the
wall Huge windows Marrow follows him in Lukes fear turning
into a vicious smile as he sees the towering windows

Nell and Theo are right behind in time to see Luke and Marrow
scooping up a table and chair respectively

LUKE
Watch out

The men rush the same window side-by-side and let the heavy
pieces
of furniture fly from ten feet

The WINDOW SHATTERS dozens of panes blown out into the darkness
beyond But the metal LATTICE remains the chairs legs stuck in
it

Marrow and Luke pause taken back a beat They hustle over to
it
Theo and Nell stand a few feet back

Luke grabs the chair levers it tries to pry open the metal
Marrow reaches through knocking loose glass trying to find some
sort of handle on the other side

THEO
Hurry

Theo watches the door behind them Luke pries at the inch of
metal

between him and freedom It wont break

MARROW
They dont open

Marrow slips on the broken glass and catches hold of the lattice

LACERATING his ring and little finger With a cry of pain he
lands

on the floor

MARROW (contd)
Oh Jesus my hand

Nell and Theo fall to the floor to help him Marrow moans and
Nell

grips his injured hand in hers Fast like she was born a trauma

doctor Nell clamps off the blood with her fingers
calm
of

possi

fire

the

NELL
Give me your shoelace

Marrow tugs at his shoe in shock and looks at Nell Shes
Terrifyingly calm And in that moment he realizes shes not out
her mind She just understands things beyond what he could

ble

begin to understand

MARROW
Whatll happen to us Nell

NELL
Nothing if you leave right now
Theres a war going on all around
us Dont get in the way please
Nell cinches the shoelace tight around his wrist
Luke throws down the chair giving up on the window
LUKE
Shit All right you

sonofabitch

As he looks up at another one of Crains painting hanging on the
wall Nell Theo with Marrow straggle toward the great hall

INT VESTIBULE TOWARDS GREAT HALL - NIGHT

LUKE
Maybe thisll get your attention

Luke flicks a LIGHTER out of his pocket

MARROW
Luke

Before anyone can stop him he LIGHTS a towering TAPESTRY on

He races from one to the next lighting them Theo and Nell help
Marrow up back away as Luke shoots by

All the tapestries are ON FIRE blazing up like torches

At last his rage spent heaving he moves to join the others at

center of the room They stare at him appalled afraid

Knowing
he has done something wrong
Luke stops Maybe fifteen feet away He sees their expressions

LUKE
What

Nell looks over at the burning tapestries Heat sears the stone
blackens the carved figures in the woodwork

The ruddy light casts deep shadows throughout the room

LUKE (contd)
Well get out after this wing
burns down Lets go

But theres no need The tapestries are consuming themselves too

fast to ignite the walls or ceiling They all realize it As
the

last flaming scraps of cloth fall to the floor and go out there
is

utter silence

INT GREAT HALL - NIGHT

Luke looks at them helplessly An awful impending beat
Without

warning the huge PERSIAN CARPET hes standing on JERKS out from

under him Luke falls on his stomach

Stunned Luke looks straight into Nells eyes Then the carpet

slides fast for the FIREPLACE It whips up to the hearth and
sends

Luke flying through the chain curtains

The others are speechless They can do nothing but watch as Luke
lays there on the ashdrop A long moment

NELL

(to the house to

Crain)

No No Let them go

She knows what is going to happen is powerless to prevent it
Luke
stands up has time to give her a look

And then the LIONS HEAD FLUE drops open behind him Luke looks
back into its iron eyes --

-- and with SHOCKING SPEED the FLUE snaps shut again taking
Lukes
head off his body

The decapitated corpse falls back in the fireplace like a puppet
with its strings cut

Nell Marrow and Theo stand there Not sure of what just
happened
their minds unable to accept it

A sound comes up in Theos throat A sob A horrified whimper
Marrow and Nell stand there speechless Its as if saying the
obvious will make it real

MARROW
Luke

BANG The blood-splattered LIONS HEAD drops open Lukes head
falls out

Theo SCREAMS and SCREAMS again Nell backs away with Marrow
almost
has the presence of mind to drag them away but --

-- CLANG The ASH DROP OPENS The sudden sound stops them in
their
tracks

As they watch its as if the House INHALES And BOOM
Out of the ash drop EXPLODES a hail of BONES SKULLS FLYING ASH

Nell Theo and Marrow back up toward the Grand Staircase as TONS
OF

INCINERATED HUMAN REMAINS vomit from the fireplace blasting
across

the floor knocking over furniture with shocking violence
Skulls

bounce over wood Hundreds of them

Theo and Marrow cover their faces as shattered bits of bone
loose
teeth pelt them Nell is immune

They run up the Grand Staircase toward the top and finally it
cant

reach them anymore

INT MEZZANINE - NIGHT

They look out at the full scope of Crains horror

THEO
Oh God we cant get out

MARROW
Nell what do we do

NELL
He played hide and seek with the
children Thats how he built the
house

Marrow stares at her trembling He glances around at the
winding
labyrinth of house Impossible

MARROW
We cant hide in here We wont
make it til morning

Nell looks at him pitying Infinitely sad but guarding them

NELL
I know

Behind them the huge painting of Hugh Crain in a golden frame
with

sharp metal spikes looks down at them The room inhales and

exhales the bumping sound resumes A rumble runs through the
house

and they all look down in fear toward the great hall where a
cloud

of ashes still hangs in the air

Unseen by them this rumble start to shake the painting behind
them

The sound from the great hall makes Marrow and Theo back up more

but Nell doesnt move she senses something is about to happen
and

she will fight it

She suddenly turns and sees the painting in a flash she
reaches

out for Marrow and Theo pull them out of the way as the giant

painting with the huge skull falls face down toward them It

misses them by a hair but their clothes are shredded by the
spikes

Marrow and Theo are-shocked as they back up right toward the
GRIFFIN
on top of the staircase

For a split second the BRASS Griffin right behind them comes
alive
opens its fangs and claws and is ready to attack but Nell

sees

the danger grabs a human bone and batters the griffin

NELL (contd)
No no you leave them alone

And the griffin turns back into brass Marrow and Theo unaware
of

what happened behind them They have to get out of there

INT SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

Nell leads Marrow and Theo down the dark hallway the twisted

woodwork along the walls frozen but seeming poised to reach out

trip someone grab a sleeve

It is a nightmare House Doing what it was made for

The BUMPING theyve left behind seems to vanish up and into the

ceiling It gives chase on the floor above Nell keeps looking

back and every time she does the BUMPING seems to get more firm

MORE LIKE A FOOTSTEP Calm Nell urges them on

NELL
Hurry

The FOOTSTEPS upstairs come faster whatevers up there moving

better more naturally

Theo and Marrow turn LEFT through an archway Nell looks back at

the ceiling The things moving fast

She dodges toward the archway where Theo and Marrow went and
STOPS

Its a wall Solid wall Theres no archway here Nell backs

away Alone

The House has separated them

Nell tries to open any of the hall doors but they are all
locked

Theres no other way then going back

INT MEZZANINE - DAY

Nell is back in the mezzanine steps carefully over Crains
painting The long white lace curtains in front of a side window

start to flutter in the wind but the window is closed

Nell walks up to the top of the stairs her back to the window
calls out
fails

at

NELL
Jim Theo

No answer and as she steps forward listening for a reply the
CURTAIN BILLOWS OUT behind her and in its movement becomes for

split second the image of CRAIN GRABBING for her
Nell oblivious steps just OUT OF REACH and as the breeze

the contours and patterns of the billowing curtain dissolve into
chaos Nell glances back at it just sees curtain and looks up

the open window

She turns from it determined and starts out to find her friends
and walks down the steps

INT GRAND STAIRCASEGREAT HALL - NIGHT
CLOSE ON THE BRASS GRIFFINS that guard the staircase

Behind Nells back they all turn toward her follow her with

their

what

fold

Nell

eyes as Nell enters the great hall And they cower in fear for
is about to happen Again Nell calls out for Theo and Marrow
And Nell doesnt see the scores of TINY ARMS OF CHILDREN that
out from the carvings in the high backed chairs in the hall as

carefully avoids stepping on the skulls and bones of the children
that cover the floor

Horrifyingly alive are these TINY HANDS as reach out for her hair
after she passes Were screaming as they almost have her and

Nell steps away

And then CREAK CREAK CREA

The terrified animal heads on the balustrade their eyes flash in
fear The lions above the big fireplace snarl restlessly

Cherubim afraid clasp hands Gods and men pay unwilling

witness

to what is now coming down the stairs

The upper flight of stairs strains under the weight of the thing
coming down over our heads coming down down and now at the
landing The sound stops
Nells BREATH escapes visible in the cold as she watches rooted
to
the floor in the Grand Entry

Darkness against darkness Something BLOCKS the glint of the
gilded
frame up on the landing Something huge A beat

And then a SHADOW sweeps across the scene impenetrable
darkening

the stairs wiping them from sight like something gliding down

them

Before our eyes out of the most subtle variation of shadow
flickers into existence

THE SHAPE tall eight or nine feet featureless black but in

the
proportions of an enormous man with his head bowed shoulders
stooped And just like that all it is
is a well of darkness and night once again We dont even
know
for sure what we just saw But it is still there in that bar of
shadow

Nell goes rigid not breathing not seeing anything but the awful
presence She is spellbound

BANG A door in the connecting passage opens and Theo and
Marrow

come out between Nell in the entry and the thing in the Great
Hall

beyond

In a flash the SHAPE is moving at Theo and Marrow They dont
see
it have their backs turned

THEO
Nell There you --

But Nell is looking past them They see her face and turn
around

NELL
Nooo not them

What is coming at them makes the blood stop

The Shape rushes from the Great Hall vanishing as it crosses the
pools of moonlight reforming darker as it hits shadow again its
wake like a shockwave invisible itself but VISIBLE IN ITS
EFFECTS

Theo SCREAMS Marrow stumbles back And then Nells voice rings
out

NELL (contd)
Is this where she bashed your
brains in

The onrushing presence STOPS Seems to turn its attention to
Nell
standing there before the towering front doors

NELL (contd)

When you came in the door I bet
that was the last thing you
expected Right From Carolyn

(beat)
You thought oh Carolyn Ive
taken it all out of her you
thought Oh Carolyn shes no
threat Carolyn Great Grandma
Carolyn Did you know that

Nell shows no fear Theres a ferocious edge to her voice

NELL (contd)
She found out what you did and
she knew there was only one way to
stop you And she stopped you so
you couldnt torture anymore of
the living

(beat)

But you wouldnt even let go of
the dead would you Well now
Im here They called me Did
you know that Theyve been
crying out for help for a long
time And I heard them

She points out at the human remains strewn all over the Great
Hall

NELL (contd)
And I wont let you hurt them
anymore

The SHAPE hovers there silent Air and shadow distort around
it
The carved animal heads on the Newell posts and walls loll back

and
forth alive then not-alive Pieces of furniture stamp in fury
try
to animate themselves but cant find limbs that work
NELL (contd)
Come on Hugh Crain you know what
to do Weve both been here
before
The SHAPE HOWLS FORWARD knocking everyone out of their seats
It

flies across the floor at Nell

Marrow and Theo are slammed against the walls out of its way

Nell OPENS WIDE HER ARMS in an EMBRACE

Its ON HER but just as it seems to hit it SPLITS like she went

right through it The SHAPE and all the debris in its wake
IMPACTS

deep in the enormous doors

The carved WOODWORK seems to suck it all in cracking groaning
And then all the SCREAMS are cut off

Nell stands there with her arms spread A long moment

She opens her eyes

And then the woodwork LASHES OUT grabs her from behind slams
her

back against the doors THE BLOW HAS KILLED HER

We feel her bones break as she crumples is drawn into the
woodwork

And for a few seconds Nells body just hangs there and then it
gently falls down

Theo lets out a horrified cry as she runs toward Nell

THEO
NELL

Marrow gets up off the floor in terror and awe his life his

beliefs changed forever He walks over to Nell and feels her
pulse

knowing it is a useless gesture as Theo softly moans over Nell

And as the camera pans up across the entry door we see a new
carving in the sculpted doors It is a woman and as we move in

n can see that she wears the same necklace as Nell

INT HILL HOUSE FRONT DOORS ENTRY - EARLY MORNING

The HOUSE INHALES And BOOM

The front doors blast wide Every door in the entry slams open

EXT HILL HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

Against the early light of a rising sun the silhouette of Hill

House Every window and every door in the House is open each and

every one CRYING OUT with a different unintelligible voice like

EXT GATE - DAWN

Theo and Marrow stand on the far side of Nells wrecked car On
the

other side of the gate Mr Dudley is undoing the chain Mrs
Dudley
stares at the ragged duo

MRS DUDLEY
(her final verdict)
City people

Mr Dudley can barely get one side of the gate open with the car

crushed in it Theo and Marrow emerge dazed into the real
world

again

MR DUDLEY

Marrow stares at him hes an exhausted man He walks away Theo
beside him

THEO

apartment with a little flower
garden where you can just see the
ocean and at night when the wind
comes in just right you can hear
the sound of the harbor What

MARROW

an experiment Now I have to
write it up

THEO
But the experiment was a failure

Now we could have him say this line

MARROW

But he should just look at her and say the same thing with his
eyes

We pull back
