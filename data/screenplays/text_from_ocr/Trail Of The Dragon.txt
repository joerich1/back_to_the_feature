VINCENT

The bulk of our business is in the
developing world too North Korea
Irag Pakistan But our production
cant always meet demand

(points to papers)
And the West persists in refusing us
access to such technologies they
deem -- outdated I assure you --
security risks

King studies the papers -- pictures and professional articles
on a micro-machine labeled a Lithotripter

KING
Whats this

VINCENT
A medical tool It removes kidney
stones via an energy-pulse from a
precision electronic switch Its
called a lithotripter

KING
And the West wont let you buy it

VINCENT
Apparently thirty-two such switches --
with modifications -- would work
similarly well in detonating a nuclear
warhead
Sl

KING
Apparently

VINCENT
You mentioned your Riardis own a
hospital supply subsidiary - Kelly
Medical I believe Which would be
able to purchase such switches without
suspicion

KING
And pass them to you

For whatever weaponry you require

ANGLE TO REVEAL

That King with Brubeck and Lee presents his report to a

Commissioner STEPHEN REGAN 54

KING

What we have here is the Chinese
government engaged in the manufacture
and export of illegal arms Not
only to North Korea Burma the
Talibanbut theyre building markets
here In the West

(beat)
And right now China believes a
relationship with the Riardis will
help them build their nuclear program

REGAN
Its public knowledge that the Chinese
are nuclear exporters

KING
To terrorist nations For profit

REGAN
CIAs been telling us that for years
We normalized trading status all the
same Thats a State Department
battle not Customs

KING
Well whats our battle

REGAN
The guns theyre shipping to San
Fran Thats gotta stop
KING
Thats what were after here Stephen
The closer we get to Xia the closer
we get to whos giving Xia his orders
We tie these guns to government names
over there we have a serious act of
international aggression on our hands

REGAN
And youre after those names

KING
Im after intent

REGAN
So what would be your strategy

KING
Sting these guys long enough to learn
Chinas master plan Lure em back
in country and lock em away

REGAN

Mr Salerno there you are Some
wine to take your thoughts off your
troubles

KING
Pour me eight figures worth

VINCENT
Mr Ku and I were just discussing
modern Shanghai Mr Stoltz wonders
whether such modernization will
inevitably lead to a capitalist
system A little angel once told
him ‘so

STOLTZ
Watch it

KING
And whats your response

VINCENT
I think it will But I also think
you in the West confuse capitalism
with democracy

KING
Theyve worked well together

VINCENT
Chinas different Democracy would
cripple China like Russia To
empower the Chinese peasant is to
affix a motor to a horse

STOLTZ
You ever meet a Chinese peasant

VINCENT
Mr Stoltz I know our relationship
is awkward--
(deftly)
--but the woman you refer to knew
the stakes Its not a system we
will ever let be changed

A WAITER wheels a LOBSTER TANK to Vincents side Vincent
peruses them gestures to select one

VINCENT
The poor will always be poor The
rich always rich The mistake of
the West is to let the poor feel
contempt for the rich and not
respect Not fear

The waiter wheels the tank to Rachel and Ze Min

STOLTZ
The fish in the tank

VINCENT
Im sorry

STOLTZ
The fish in the tank You dont

invention It is as American as
killing Indians

suffered because she refused our
rules Whereas you succeed -- because
you learned to play

Ku gasps shivering to hear the words--

KU

the phone and we want a goddamn escort--

Rachel spins and CALLS to Ze Min in sharp Mandarin The
guards immediately STORM for the table causing commotion
among the diners

King turns to Stoltz scared now seeing the end charging

KING

shadow black-eyed and swollen face wearing rags

A sliver of light comes through a square in a metal door
The man -- King - finally turns his beaten face to it

As the sounds of FOOTSTEPS rise and a MANS VOICE babbling
in Mandarin Desperate pleading getting closer--

hauling a PRISONER his face covered with a drawstring sack
as he struggles his cries reaching a crescendo with--

KU (0S)
I AM AMERICAN

--as the guards haul him past He continues his pleas in
Mandarin the voice soon fading

King still sits in the corner too weak to rise He closes
his eyes with sadness

A silent moment passes King opens his eyes

The MUFFLED SHOTS of an os firing squad RING OUT It jolts
King with shock Then silence again

INT PRISON CELL - LATER

King lies sprawled on the floor sleeping with the roaches
as a lock RATCHETS free The metal door SWINGS OPEN--

--and two GUARDS step in They bark at him in Mandarin
hauling King up as he stirs awake--

KING
What do you want

--and a guard reveals a drawstring sack King snaps alert--

KING
Wait no wait WAIT

--and the sack is forced over his head plunging everything
again into BLACKNESS

A long silent moment in the dark
EXT CHINESE AIRFIELD - DAY

As a blindfold is WHISKED AWAY to reveal Kings squinting
face Brightness all around him

His bruises have faded his rags are gone He wears an
sweatshirt and khakis his hands cuffed

Two GUARDS march him toward the staircase of a waiting US
military airplane There a US ARMY OFFICER stands with
several Chinese MILITARY OFFICERS

Disoriented King is marched to the staircase and the waiting
men His guards remove the handcuffs

and steps aside to let King pass

Below a sedan is parked with diplomatic flags fluttering
Stephen Regan stands waiting with two other TREASURY
OFFICIALSand Senator Joseph King

King surveys the city beyond Surveys the tarmac Four men
and one vehicle No press No heros welcome

King descends the stairs Joseph steps to embraces him

JOSEPH KING
Thank God--

KING
No -one knows

Joseph tenses steps away from the embrace

KING
No one knows

JOSEPH KING
It was the arrangement Matthew

KING
Two Americans were murdered

Joseph doesnt answer Instead smiles
JOSEPH KING

Rachel and the kids are here in
Washington Theyre staying with me--

KING
Two Americans

JOSEPH KING
Theyre happy youre home

KING
What was the arrangement

JOSEPH KING
The Chinese accused us of sending
spies We accused them of smuggling
guns We reached an agreement on
your return with the mutual
understanding that the entire affair
will be kept out of the press

KING
Why are you protecting--

JOSEPH KING
Because youre my son

King falls silent for a moment

JOSEPH KING
The President himself secured your
release Upon my request And in
returnI will not be running in
November
(beat)
That was the price

KING
Theres always a price

JOSEPH KING
There is Yes

KING
And no one will know what happened
to Hammond Ku Or Gary Stoltz

JOSEPH KING
The game is peaceful relations with
China Matthew And in this game
you and I Were nothing Because
the pot is billions of dollars and
millions of American jobs And a
world without enemies

KING
A world run by moneys not a world
without enemies
(beat)

game

A shadow seems to pass over Josephs face

JOSEPH KING
You said you had evidence on Pacific
Rim You said proof of payments of
destabilizing us at home What you
took something Sent something
(beat)
Where is it

KING
Who wants to know

JOSEPH KING
Were going to get into that car and
go to the White House The CIA the
State Department the President
theyre waiting for your briefing
They want to see your evidence

KING
And whatll they do with it

JOSEPH KING
This is your country Matthew This
is your home

KING
And what do we do with the truth in
my home

The shadow seems to darken The face grows cold

JOSEPH KING
So you tell your wild story what
to who The press The Net Youll
be discredited youll be smeared
the administration will not let it
happen Matthew China means too
much No one will believe you were
ever there Do you hear me No one
will believe you

KING
Do you

Joseph shuts his eyes Then stares sadly
JOSEPH KING
Come home son
(hopeful)
Come home

Joseph turns and walks to the sedan Says something to Regan
and the Treasury officials They enter the sedan

Joseph stands at the sedan holding a door open

At long last King walks for it

And walks right by

Leaving his father and the car behind its American flags
fluttering As he trudges his own way down the tarmac

Joseph watches him go sadly Steps into the sedan It drives
off with a sweeping turn and speeds away

King keeps walking

The monuments are distant but somehow seem within reach
So King keeps walking eyes set on the future

A free American And all alone

FADE TO BLACK
