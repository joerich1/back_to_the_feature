FADE IN
EXT OFFICE BUILDING - TWILIGHT

A highrise in downtown LA framed tall against the
mountains People stream out of the front door leaving
work

CUT TO
INT BASEMENT

In the near darkness of basement a security guard makes
his way into an inner cellar His flashlight finds a man
in work clothes bent over a panel his back to the light

GUARD
Hey This areas restricted

The man doesnt look around We can just almost see his
face as he talks

MAN
Yeah I uh got called in
some of this wiring got screwed up

GUARD
Nobody called it down to me Im
gonna have to see a work order

MAN
Yeah Just one second

CLOSEUP ON HIS HAND
reaches into his toolbox

He rises turning and A KNIFE IS SHOVED THROUGH HIS EAR
It is pulled back out with calm efficiency The man turns
wide-eyed hand to his ear Mouth open in silent protest
Out of his hand drops the work order He slumps over
Dies

HOWARD FISK takes off the guards hat Dripping knife
aside he is an ordinary-looking man His face is dead
calm only his eyes betraying the sea of hate behind it

He drags the body into a dark corner grabbing a duffle bag
from out of the shadows Then checking his watch he goes
to the panel and begins making adjustments of his own WE
PAN over to the door of the panel It reads ELEVATORS

CUT TO
INT OFFICE TOWER - ELEVATOR BANK - 42ND FLOOR

Its the end of the day and people are waiting for the
elevator The doors open its already crowded inside
People groan shuttle on A YOUNG EXEC moos A few people

The young execs FRIEND presses the LOBBY button even
though its already lit The young exec nods

YOUNG EXEC

A SWEATY MAN 50s overweight presses tighter into the
corner beside his SECRETARY Pats at his brow with a
hankie

The elevator descends quickly

ELEVATOR CABLES

Something wired to the cables just above the elevator

red light flashes on the black box a split second before it
EXPLODES

SMASH CUT TO
EXT OUTSIDE BUILDING - EVENING

A car comes SCREECHING to a halt near the front of the
building a red and blue light flashing on top The door
is thrown open and SWAT officer JACK TRAVEN steps out from
behind the wheel almost before the car has stopped Jack
heads straight for the entrance as HARRY TEMPLE his older
partner gets out the other side and follows tossing Jack
his flak jacket Jack puts it on without ever taking his
eyes off the entrance as they make their way through police
cars fire trucks and various uniforms WE SEE these two
are a team and that when they move Jack takes the lead

We are still TRACKING with Jack and Harry as WE SEE two
more SWAT guys emerge from another car fall into step
Another team joins them as they enter the

INT LOBBY

Just as another pair burst in through another set of doors
finally eight SWAT members all wordlessly sync walking
with Jack and Harry until the whole unit stands in front of

CAPTAIN HERB MCMAHON 40s on the PHONENORWOOD his
technical assistant looks at BLUEPRINTS with BAGWELL a
middle-aged guy with building maintenance supervisor on
his worksuit

Then McMahon hangs up the phone addresses the group

INT ELEVATOR SHAFT
Jack is being lowered headfirst on a rope down the center
of the shaft He holds the window-washing cable with a
hook on its end He and Harry are speaking through their
microphones

HARRY
What do you do

JACK
Something else right

He continues down The elevator approaches Jack comes to
the elevator carHe signals and Harry stops

Jack looks leery at the C4 by his feet Quietly secures
the hook to part of the elevators frame

JACK

Harry runs over to the window washing winch He flips a
switch and the winch starts pulling in the cable

Jack watches as the extra cable starts unspooling pulled
up He starts climbing for the access panel

EXT ROOF

The winch spools in cable

INT HOUSING SHED

Harry looks down at the elevator

ANOTHER PLACE

Fisk listens hears the winch faintly He fingers a small
box with a plastic button and a timer counting down Three
minutes left We notice that the hand fingering the box is
missing its thumb

The hand starts moving more agitatedly Fisks face
registers growing concern Two minutes fifty-three seconds

With sudden violence he jabs the button
INT ELEVATOR

Jack takes one final look down There is still a bunch of
slack cable lying on the elevator On the bomb a tiny red
light comes one

Without hesitation Jack HURLS himself through the access
panel as the bomb BLOWS

INT ELEVATOR

The passengers SCREAM as the elevator shakes begins to
drop

the shaft

BAGWELL
Usually they fall down now

INT HALL
Harry bursts in from the stairs

HARRY
Hes early

JACK
Lets get them off

EXT ROOF - THE WINDOW-WASHING WINCH

The weight on the cable is starting to pull it from its
foundation It groans and starts to crack -- cant bear
this weight for long The wheels start to come off the
track Then with a loud bang the winch breaks free flies
across the roof and comes to a stop at the door to the
elevator machine room

INT HALL

Jack and Harry look at each other And BOLT

ANOTHER FLOOR - JACK AND HARRY

Emerge from the stairs race over to the elevator access
panel

Gives a bit more under the strain of the cable
THE ELEVATOR

It drops a few inches People yell gasp cry
JACK AND HARRY

Get the last screw out of another access panel They can
see the bottom two feet of the elevator doors With a
grunt they pry open the doors Peoples feet and the
sounds of panic

Two more SWAT guys arrive and help pull

THE WINCH

About to break free

JACK AND HARRY

-Pull out two more people

THE WINDOW WASHING WINCH

Rips through the door frame wedges against an ENGINE
THE ELEVATOR

Drops sharply Oh God But then it stops now with
only the top three feet of the elevator showing

THE CABLE

Is being held by whats left of the platform -- some slats
of splintering wood and lengths of bending metal Its
giving way slowly an inch at a time

JACK AND HARRY

Now pull people up to get them out They see the elevator
sinking the opening closing Two and a half feet Two
feet They have one woman to pull out Shes halfway
her legs still in

THE CABLE

Pulls free as the mass of wood and metal finally gives way
THE ELEVATOR

Drops

JACK AND HARRY

Pull the woman as hard as they can as the huge metal box
flies down shooting out sparks --

HER LEGS

Sliding out as the top of the car races down on them --
shes not gonna make it --

ELEVATOR SHAFT

The elevator drops like a rock trailing cable It drops
so far that it disappears from sight A huge sound when it
hits bottom

INT MAIN LOBBY

McMahon and the other SWAT and bomb guys are almost knocked
off their feet by the impact reverberating throughout the
building

ELEVATOR DOORS
In the lobby buckle out from the air concussion
INT HALL

The woman terrified looks down at her legs The elevator
just clipped off her high heel Jack and Harry exchange a
Look

The other SWAT guys usher the rescued passengers to the
stairwell as Jack and Harry lean against the wall a little
out of breath

JACK
Is your watch slow

HARRY
(shaking his head)
He jumped the gun We had three
minutes

JACK
Why does he do that Hes blowing
three million

HARRY
Maybe he couldnt hold his wad

problem among middle-aged men
although I myself --

JACK

HARRY
He couldve blown that thing from
Pacoima
JACK

No he knew we were up to
something Hes close by

HARRY

climbing down rungs

INT ELEVATOR SHAFT
Jack and Harry move down the shaft
THE FREIGHT CAR

as Jack arrives Pulls his 9mm Glock and steps from the
rungs lightly onto the car HARRY right behind him The
car sinks slightly from their weight

Jack points at the hatch cover on the elevator roof Harry
nods and pulls his Glock He and Jack kneel by the hatch
cover Jack grabs the handle Harry makes the countdown
hand signals Three two --

A shotgun BLAST nearly takes their heads off splintering
part of the hatch cover Both men jump back A second
shot right by Harrys foot sends him jumping away he steps
on the hatch cover and it gives away He falls into the
elevator hitting his head badly

JACK
Harry

We HEAR Harry being knocked out by the butt end of a rifle
INT ELEVATOR

Fisks finger pushes a button on a control panel

JACK

Sprawled out as the elevator starts to rise Another
shotgun blast takes out a plate-sized chunk right next to
him

Jack wants to return fire but hears Harry yelling in pain
and doesnt know where to shoot Another blast right next
to him keeps him prone in the corner He senses something
and looks up

HIS POV

The elevator barrels toward the ceiling of the shaft

JACK

With no other choice jumps feet first through the pen
hatch

INT ELEVATOR

Jack comes crashing down into the elevator lands hard
The air is thick with shotgun smoke The few lights not
shot out flicker Jack looks up and is transfixed Hes
looking into

THE BARREL OF A SHOTGUN
He hears a voice out of the smoke

FISK
I dont suppose anybody would pay
three million just for you

Fisk chuckles Then a loud dull click Another click
The shotgun is empty

JACK
Brings his gun up fast

JACK
Drop it

The gun drops Through smoke and flickering light Jack
gets a good look at Howard Fisk Fisk is calm his arm
around the still groggy Harry In his hand is a deadmans
stick His coat opens enough for us to see he has sticks
of dynamite roped around his chest

Jack grins Its going to be okay
EXT THE FREEWAY

A half-mile ahead theres an accident blocking the three
right lanes There are flames on the road and a POLICEMAN
is trying to direct traffic

Traffic is backed-up a hundred yards from the accident and
is tunneling through the one open lane -- the far left lane

Jack sees the bus It is mired in the jam as well But
its all the way over to the left fifty yards from Jack

Jack pulls his car over onto the right shoulder stops and
gets out He hurries for the bus Its a race against
time as the bus is heading for the choke point building
speed as the cars funnel through ahead of it

Jack gets to the bus just as its about to go past the
accident He runs along beside it knocking on the bus
door

JACK
Stop Open up
MRS KAMINO

the bus
ANNIE
(dryly)

Can you blame him

SAM
Get off the doors man Wait for

JACK
LAPD Stop the bus

But he is barely audible from inside He pulls his badge
out of his back pocket but is bumped by a passing car in
the right lane and drops it

HELEN
Maybe you should let him on Sam

Annie gives a concerned look

Sam speeds up to get away from Jack as Jack retrieves the
badge

A young Hispanic RAY watches Jack chasing the bus He
looks around at everyone nervously Says nothing

Jack tries to get in front of the bus but Sam doesnt slow
down so Jack has to get out of the way

The bus is getting away Hes running as fast as he can
He tries to pull the rear doors No go The doors slip
from his grasp He pounds futilely on the last plastic
side panel and the bus is gone

Jack staggers doubles over exhausted

Cars honk at him swerve around him

Jack looks back His car is a half mile back still in
thick traffic not an issue Jack stops out in front of
the oncoming cars

JACK
Stop

We hear brakes screeching and a man yelling

A truck has pulled in front of them Attached to the back
is a low wooden dolly Jack is standing on it in his SWAT
gear with a headset and a bunch of tools

ON THE TRUCK

McMahon is on the back of the truck He has a headset as
well

MCMAHON

ANNIE

Gee thanks for the tip

The truck slows a bit and the dolly inches closer to the

He starts to disappear under the bus Annie squints with
concentration McMahon looks on concerned Jack looks
straight up keeping as calm as possible as the bus covers
his head

UNDER THE BUS

Jack inches under the bomb He speaks (always into the
headset until stated otherwise) to McMahon

JACK
Okay tell them to hold here

He looks up at the bomb From his P0V the bomb is so
close it fills our line of vision There are wires running
from the timer to various detonators Also a few covered
wires of different colors sticking in one end of the timer
and out the other

INT POLICE STATION

HARRY
What do you see

JACK
Its pretty standard Timers
looped to the remote then feeds

Can you find the trip wire for the

remote

JACK
I dont know I got a few choices
here

HARRY

Black and red

JACK
And green

HARRY
Okay Listen Im guessing hes
not going to use standard copper
for the remote Too weak Id
use a fiber alloy I need you to
look at the wire

JACK
Its covered

HARRY
I know You gotta cut off the
sheath But dont cut the wire

JACK
Right

HARRY
Start with the green

He has to work slowly Hes so close to the bus he cant
look at his tools he feels for them and brings them up to
his chest

He palms an exacto and carefully starts scraping away at
the green plastic covering

The bus hits a tiny

BUMP

and Jack SLIPS goes stock still as sweat drips down his
forehead He looks at the knife It has gone halfway
through the wire Very very slowly he pulls it out

He scrapes some more at the sheath revealing a silverish
wire not copper

JACK
Bullseye

HARRY
Great Clip on the battery and
run it to the lead wire

He palms the battery clips one end to the silver wire with
the alligator clip He searches out the lead wire He
finds it a cloud crossing his expression

JACK

I cant bypass Itll fire

Yeah Shit This thing is

airtight

Harry is thinking when Robin enters moves toward him with
a printout speaking

into the ceiling

No more shots -- Fisk must be out of bullets Jack starts
inching for the back of the car

Fisk is right behind him

Unchecked fury mars his face more than the eerie dye All
semblance of control is gone Roaring he SLAMS his fist
into Jacks face

He practically foaming at the mouth hitting Jack with the
hand that holds the deadmans stick Jack is helpless
hes wounded and Fisk has the stick He feebly tries to
defend himself

Fisk is on his knees over Jack He starts hitting Jack in
his arm wound Jack nearly blacks out from pain

along a freeway
