FADE IN
THE HIGHWAY - DAY

Georgia Two-lane blacktop stretching from here to heaven
Empty Silent Then suddenly in the far distance several
dark specks rise over a hill and head straight toward camera

Camera holds and the specks begin to take form Vehicles
Trucks Six monstrous eighteen-wheel diesels coming at us
their smokestacks blasting Sound grows louder as we begin
to hear snatches of Citizens Band Radio talk over

VOICE ONE
-- Breaker this is Banana Peel

VOICE TWO
-- Yeah Breaker go head on

VOICE ONE
-- Thanks much Id like to get me a
Smokey report

VOICE TWO
-- Road looks clean as a hounds
tooth

VOICE ONE

-- Okey doke Last one to the Roadeo
is a homo

Voices fade and titles and credits begin Black Smoke Blowing
Over Eighteen Wheels by Red Simpson comes up in the bg as
the six trucks blast right over camera

AN AERIAL VIEW

of the trucks driving through an entrance gate to a huge
parking lot Over the gate is a sign reading GEORGIA TRUCK
ROADEO STATE FINALS Music and credits continue

TRUCK ROADEO - PARKING LOT - DAY

Macks Kenworths Whites and Jimmys all polished to a
mirrored finish Truck drivers decked out in their flashiest
western outfits The stands filled with spectators on the
edge of their seats watching the gearjammers put their rigs
through tests of skill and reflexes -- parallel parking
driving around eggs through complicated barricades etc
CAMERA PICKS UP

a customized white Cadillac convertible pulling into the
Roadeo grounds The Caddy has mounted chrome quarter horses
on each front fender bull horns on the front bumper stacked
rifles displayed in the rear Garish The cars Texas license
plate reads Mr Big

CLOSER ANGLE

The Cadillac stops Two men climb out and wend their way
through the trucks and spectators Camera tracks behind them
Although we cant see their faces we see that one man is
pudgy and decked out in a fancy white western suit and hat
The other is younger tall skinny and wearing a grey western
suit and hat Kyle Brand and his son Dickey

MUSIC AND CREDITS FADE
ANGLE - ROADEO INFIELD

The crowd roars as the trucks race through an obstacle
course

ANGLE - THE MEN - TRACKING
Camera still on their backs
DICKEY

KYLE

DICKEY

KYLE

Kyle laughs His laugh then turns into a hacking cough

DICKEY
Why dont we just rent a Lear jet
and haul it back ourselves

KYLE
Because I wanna see this hot shot
Bandit do something that cant be
done Besides theres nothing I
like better than breaking legends

He laughs coughs again continues walking

DICKEY

(not getting it)
But if it cant be done hows he

Over there behind his rig

The Husband shoots his old lady a jealous look Dickey rejoins
Kyle and they head toward Bandit LaRues truck

NEW ANGLE - MOVING
as they come to the only battered beaten-up eighteen-wheeler

at the entire Truck Roadeo It looks like it hasnt been
washed since it left the showroom
On one side of the truck is a faded and peeling mural of a
stagecoach being held up A teamster and a shotgun guard
have their hands high in the air and a Bandit on horseback
has a six-gun pointed at them

An elaborate CB radio antenna grows out of the cab beside
the drivers door

ANGLE - KYLE AND DICKEY - FROM BEHIND

as they round the truck and stop in their tracks

REVERSE ANGLE - WHAT THEY SEE

A hammock is stretched from the cab of the truck to an oak
tree A man wearing a faded denim western shirt open with
the sleeves rolled up levis and silver-toed cowboy boots is
lying in the hammock A cowboy hat covers his face

CLOSER ANGLE

as shadows fall across the figure The man slowly tips back
his hat and we see hes in his thirties boyishly handsome
with a cocky smile Bandit LaRue

FULL SHOT

And for the first time we get a look at Kyle and Dickey
Kyle is wearing sunglasses and diamond rings on every finger

His smile is as tasteless as the suit he wears

Dickey is in his early twenties Blonde blue-eyed and scared
to death of his old man

Bandit looks at them for a moment then casually pulls the
hat back over his face

KYLE
Aw aint you glad to see me Bandit

BANDIT
(hat over his face)
Yeah its the highlight of my day

Theres a long pause interrupted by Kyles hacking cough

KYLE
(to Dickey)

BANDIT
(hat over his face)

DICKEY
Five thou

KYLE
Chickenshit money

Kyle coughs again

BANDIT
(hat over his face)
Could you turn your head

Bandit gets up and begins untying the hammock from the tree
Kyle crosses to him

BANDIT
Look Kyle I aint in this Truck
Roadeo for the money Its the
challenge You know the ecstasy of
victory the agony of defeat

Kyle looks out at the cheering crowd

KYLE
I cant believe theres two thousand
people here to watch a bunch of guys

BANDIT
Americas bored

(then)
Now what do you want

KYLE

Kyle and Dickey run alongside

KYLE

BANDIT
(indicating truck)

truck

Mississippi State Lines

DISSOLVE THRU TO

THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The rig is parked on the shoulder under a highway light
Bandit and Cledus stand by the side of the truck as Fred
wanders aimlessly around the grassy knoll off the shoulder

BANDIT

impatiently)

How longs this gonna take

CLEDUS

Bandit walks away from Cledus in mid-sentence heading for
the rear of the truck

Running blocker

CUT TO
THE BACK DOORS OF THE TRUCK

As Bandit swings them open Cledus adjusts one of two ramps
that have now been mounted on the rear of the trucks floor
As Cledus kicks the ramp into place Bandit climbs into the
back of the trailer and disappears

After a moment there is a deafening roar and suddenly two
headlights are GLARING straight at camera

A beat and slowly a full-blown SHELBY COBRA II appears from
inside the truck As it moves slowly down the ramp we see
it has twelve coats of black lacquer red pinstriping
aluminum mags twelve-inch Firestones the works A mean

On the rear bumper is a CB antenna matching the one on the
truck

CAMERA FOLLOWS
as Bandit guides the Cobra down the ramp Cledus quickly
folds up the ramp and dumps it back into the truck He slams
the metal doors closed and crosses to the Cobra
