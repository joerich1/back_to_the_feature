FADE IN

EXT RECREATION AREA - DAY

A burning-red apple flies through space As the pristine orb
draws its downward arc in the sky it somehow loses its
brilliant hue

JONAS 11 catches the apple and promptly inspects the odd
fruit squinting his pale eyes

ASHER (0OC)
Toss it back Jonas

Twenty yards across from Jonas a round-faced boy with
unkempt hair ASHER 11 waves his arms Jonas heaves the
apple back toward his playmate who drops it on the ground
as it arrives

JONAS
Asher have you noticed anything
strange about that apple

ASHER
That it keeps jumping out of my
hands

Asher retrieves the fruit and tosses it back to Jonas
Against the grey sky the change happens again just for a
flickering second that brilliant burning red overtakes the
black-and-white

Just as Jonas catches the apple a voice blares out from a
speaker-box mounted on the nearby building structure

SPEAKER (VO)
The recreational period has ended
Please return to your classrooms

Immediately obediently Asher and the school of other
children in the vicinity cease their games and start toward
the building

ASHER
Come on Jonas

Jonas blinks over his pale irises in a fit He stares
nonplussed at the apples now-grey skin With classmates
streaming by him he furtively slips the fruit into a pocket
on his tunic and then trails his peers into the building

INT JONAS DWELLING - DINING AREA - NIGHT
Muted colors Simple d√©cor Gathered around the dining table
with Jonas is his strikingly vanilla family unit FATHER
30s MOTHER 30s and little LILY only 7

They have just finished their evening meal

FATHER
Who wants to be the first to share
feelings tonight

Lily wiggles in her seat with impatience

JONAS
You go Lily

LILY
Um I felt very angry this
afternoon My childcare group was
at the play area and we had a
visiting group of Sevens and they
didnt obey the rules at all One
of them - a male I dont know his
name - kept going right in front
of the line for the slide I felt
so angry at him so I made my hand
like this

Lily squeezes her tiny hand into a defiant fist

MOTHER
Why do you think the visitors
didnt obey the rules

LILY
I dont know

FATHER
Where were the visitors from
Lily-billy

LILY
Our leader told us but I - I
dont remember I must not have
been paying attention They were
from far Another community

MOTHER
Do you think its possible that
the rules in their community may
just be different than our own

LILY
I suppose

JONAS
Youve visited other communities

havent you

Lily nods
FATHER
How did you feel there

LILY
Strange They were learning usages
that my group wasnt yet so we
felt stupid

FATHER
Im thinking Lily about the boy
today Do you think its possible
that he --

The speaker-box planted high in the corner of the dwelling
blares on

SPEAKER (VO)
Attention This is a reminder to
male elevens that objects are not
to be removed from the recreation
area and that snacks are to be
eaten not hoarded

Jonas shrinks in his seat His family unit subtly peeks over
at the desk in the adjoining living area where the apple
rests next to a magnifying glass

Father breaks the painful silence

FATHER
Lily do you think its possible
that the boy simply felt strange
being in a place he knew nothing
about

LILY
Yes

FATHER
Are you still angry

LILY
I guess not I guess I feel a
little sorry for him And sorry I
made a fist

FATHER
Well then I have a concern at
work One of the newchildren in
the Nurturing Center was born
undersized

LILY
What gender is it

FATHER
Male Hes a lovely little male
but he isnt growing as fast as he
should and he doesnt sleep
soundly We have him in the extra
care section for supplemental
nurturing but the committee is
beginning to talk about releasing
him

MOTHER
Oh no I know how sad that must
make you feel

Jonas and Lily nod sympathetically

FATHER
Well Im going to keep trying I
may ask the committee for
permission to bring him here at
night You know what the
night-crew Nurturers are like I
think this little guy needs
something extra

MOTHER
Of course

LILY
Maybe we could even keep him

MOTHER
Lily you know the rules

LILY
Well

Lily simpers Mother grins

FATHER
Jonas youre up

Jonas clears his throat and takes his time to find the
correct words

JONAS
I-Im feeling apprehensive

FATHER
Why is that son

JONAS
I know theres nothing really to
worry about and that every adult
has been through it But its the
Ceremony Im apprehensive about
Its almost December

Little Lily whispers in awe

LILY
The Ceremony of Twelve

MOTHER
Lily go get into your
nightclothes now Father and I are
going to stay here and talk to
Jonas for a while

LILY
Privately

Mother nods Lily reluctantly scampers off

FATHER
(to Jonas)
Im glad you told us your
feelings You know every December
was exciting to me when I was
young too Each one brings such
changes

MOTHER
(to Father)
But to be honest for you there
wasnt the element of suspense
that there is with Jonas
Ceremony

FATHER
Well no I was already fairly
certain of what my Assignment
would be

JONAS
But didnt the Elders select in
secret How could you have known

FATHER
Well it was pretty clear what my
aptitude was I spent almost all
my volunteer hours in the
Nurturing Center Of course the
Elders knew that from their
observation So I expected it and
was pleased but not surprised
when my Assignment was announced
as Nurturer

MOTHER
Yes and I wasnt all that
surprised when they announced my
Assignment in the Department of
Justice either

JONAS
Did the community still applaud
even though they werent
surprised

Father shoots Jonas a warm smirk
FATHER

Of course The selections are very
rarely big surprises Whats
important is the preparation
youll receive for your adult
life

JONAS
I know Everyone knows that I
just dont know where the Elders
might decide to place me

Mother reassuringly reaches across the table and places her
hand atop Jonas

MOTHER
There are very rarely
disappointments Jonas Theres no
need to feel apprehensive

INT CLASSROOM - DAY

Jonas sits perfectly upright in a desk amongst his similarly
upright peers as an instructor delivers a presentation on a
view-screen at the head of the classroom The screen
displays schematics for a small airplane

INSTRUCTOR
Inside every search plane
contains a screen on the front
panel where blurbs of heat show
up as smears on the radar

Jonas eyes stray across the room to a girl seated on the
other side FIONA 11 She has light flowing hair and a
tragic innocent face

INSTRUCTOR (contd)
The sensors on the planes
exterior trace the warm object and
show it to the pilot who sends
word down to the search parties to
investigate This way the lost
can always be rescued in the
unlikely event --

Asher bursts through the classroom door panting for air He
dashes to his desk right next to Jonas

ASHER

(to the class)
I apologize for inconveniencing my
learning community I left home at
the correct time but when I was
along near the hatchery the crew
was separating some salmon I
guess I just got distraught
watching them

His classmates struggle not to laugh

THE CLASS
We accept you apology Asher

INSTRUCTOR
And I thank you Asher because
once again you have provided an
opportunity for a lesson in
language Distraught is too
strong an adjective

The instructor scrawls DISTRACTED next to the word
DISTRAUGHT on the board The immature class titters as
Asher sinks into his desk

EXT JONAS DWELLING - DAY
Father parks his bicycle in a row of bikeports outside the
dwelling Lily rushes over as he unstraps the carrying
basket from the back of the bike

LILY
Oh look Hes here Isnt he
cute Look how tiny he is And he
has funny eyes like yours Jonas

Jonas approaches the commotion glaring at his sister
Father rebukes Lily with his tone

FATHER
Lily

LILY
(to Jonas)
Im sorry for being rude

JONAS
I accept your apology Lily

LILY
But look how cute

Inside the basket lay the precious NEWCHILD no more than a
few months old The baby has pale solemn eyes akin to
those of Jonas

LILY
Maybe he had the same birthmother
as you Jonas

INT JONAS DWELLING - LIVING AREA - NIGHT

Father places a document filled with text and four lines for
signature on the studying desk

FATHER
We must all sign this pledge
promising not to become attached
to our temporary guest My plea
for the newchild was accepted by
the committee this afternoon

Fathers produces a fountain pen and signs on a line

FATHER (contd)
He has been labeled as Uncertain
and granted an extra year of
nurturing before his Naming and
(MORE)

FATHER (contd)
Placement That is assuming he is
able to reach the special set of
weight and maturity standards that
the committee has agreed upon
The rest of the family unit form a queue to add their

signatures

FATHER (contd)

From now on the newchild will
spend every night with our family
unit so that I may nurture him to

the best of my abilities

But we

must agree to relinquish him

without protest or appeal

years Ceremony when he is

at next

assigned a family unit of his own

himself with schoolwork at the desk
the newchild

LILY

feigning disinterest in

I think newchildren are so cute
When I become a twelve I hope I
get assigned to be a Birthmother

MOTHER

Lily Dont say that Theres very
little honor in that Assignment

LILY

But Natasha the Ten who lives
down the street does most of her
volunteer hours at the Birthing
Center She told me that the
Birthmothers get wonderful food
they have gentle exercise periods
and most of the time they just
play games while theyre waiting

I think Id enjoy that

MOTHER

Lily for the relatively short
period of their lives that theyre

actually allowed to bear
newchildren thats true

But it

doesnt last When its decided
that their time is up in the

Birthing Center they all become
simple Laborers in the Community

(MORE)

MOTHER (contd)

until they enter the House of the

Old

FATHER

Anyway Lily-billy Birthmothers
never even get to see newchildren
If you enjoy the little ones so
much you should hope for an
Assignment as Nurturer like me
MOTHER
When youre an Eight and you start
your volunteer hours you can try
some at the Nurturing Center

FATHER
Speaking of the Nurturing Center
I took a peek at the committees
advance list of names for next
Ceremonys newchildren while I was
there today

LILY
Father

FATHER
I know I feel a little guilty
But I figured it would help in his
nurturing if I could call the
little guy by a name

MOTHER
What is it

FATHER
His name - if he makes it to the
Naming without being released of
course - is set to be Gabriel

LILY
Baby Gabriel

FATHER
I call him Gabe actually I
whisper it to him if no one else
is around

RECEPTIONIST
Hello Jonas

He approaches the receptionists desk and signs into a thick
binder She stamps the signature with an ink seal

RECEPTIONIST
Its good to have some volunteers
here today We celebrated a
release this morning and that
always throws the schedule off a
little so things tend to get
backed up

The receptionist scans another sheet of paper

RECEPTIONIST
Lets see Asher and Fiona are in
the bathing room Why dont you
join them there

INT BATHING ROOM - DAY
Thick clouds of steam waft through the area Serene sounds

of dripping and splashing liquid arrest the room Jonas
quickly trades his tunic for a smock at a changing station
ASHER (0OC)
Hi Jonas

Jonas advances into the room and spots Asher washing one of
the Old in a tub Fiona is at work ouside the adjacent tub
gently bathing an old man The young groupmates exchange
smiles and nods

Jonas approaches a row of padded lounging chairs where the
Old are waiting He stops in front of an elderly woman

JONAS
Your turn Larissa

Jonas escorts the woman to one of the many tubs which
automatically fills with warm water LARISSA sheds her robe
Jonas helps her into the tub

JONAS
Comfortable

Jonas squeezes cleansing lotion over Larissas frail body
He peeks over at Fiona and catches her tenderly patting the
old mans naked body with an absorbent towel

LARISSA
This morning we celebrated the
release of Roberto It was
wonderful

JONAS
I knew Roberto I helped with his
feeding the last time I was here
just a few weeks ago He was a
very interesting man

LARISSA
Oh yes They told his whole life
before they released him They
always do but to be honest some
of the tellings are a little
boring When they released Edna
last week - Did you know Edna

Jonas shakes his head and squeezes out his sponge

LARISSA
They tried to make her life sound
meaningful - and all lives are
meaningful of course - but Edna
was a birthmother my goodness
Then she worked in Food Production
for years before coming here She
never even had a family unit I
dont think Edna was very smart

Jonas snickers at Larissas appraisal of Edna as he rinses
the soaps suds from her chest
LARISSA
But Robertos was wonderful He
had been an Instructor on the
planning committee He even raised
two wonderful children Goodness
I dont know how he found the
time

JONAS
What happens when they make the
actual release Where did Roberto
actually go

LARISSA
Oh I dont know I dont think
anybody does except the
committee He just bowed to all of
us and walked through the special
door in the Releasing Room like
they all do But you should have
seen his look Pure happiness

JONAS
I wish Id been there to see it

Jonas steals another glance at Fiona

INT JONAS SLEEPING-ROOM - DAY

Jonas awakens from his slumber with a devilish smile
plastered across his face

INT JONAS DWELLING - DINING AREA - DAY

their morning meal

And then they caught me And
thats how it ended

MOTHER
Thank you for your dream Lily

Mother looks to Father

FATHER
I have no dream to report from

Father looks to the fidgeting newchild jokingly expecting
him to continue the family dream sharing The whole unit
laughs respectfully

MOTHER
How about you Jonas
JONAS
I did dream last night

FATHER
Good Tell us

Jonas shifts in his chair
JONAS
The details arent clear really
I think I was in the bathing room
at the House of the Old

INT BATHING ROOM - DAY

The room is wrapped in an endless haze filled with copious
amounts of piping-hot steam

FATHER (OS)
Thats where you were yesterday

JONAS (0S)
But it wasnt really the same
There was a tub in the dream but
only one

The single tub is there spilling over with water

JONAS (0S)
Everything was warm and damp And
I had taken off my tunic but
hadnt put on my smock so my
chest was bare

Jonas half-nude approaches the tub

JONAS (0S)
I was perspiring because it was
so warm And Fiona was there the
way she was yesterday

Fiona appears fully clothed She laughs at Jonas

MOTHER (0OS)
And Asher too

JONAS (0S)
No It was only me and Fiona
alone in the room She was
laughing but I wasnt I was
almost a little angry at her in
the dream because it seemed like
she wasnt taking me seriously

INT JONAS DWELLING - DINING AREA - DAY

Mother and Father lean in to absorb Jonas words
LILY
Serious about what

Jonas struggles with the concept

JONAS
I think I was trying to convince
her that she should get into the
water I wanted to take her
clothes off and get into the tub

MOTHER
Thats all

JONAS
I wanted to bathe her I had the
sponge in my hand But she
wouldnt She kept laughing and
saying no

FATHER
Can you describe the strongest
feeling in your dream son

Jonas gathers his thoughts

JONAS
The wanting I knew she wouldnt
and I knew that she shouldnt But
I wanted it so terribly

MOTHER
Thank you for your dream Jonas

Mother glances at Father

FATHER
Lily its time to leave for
school Would you walk beside me
this morning and keep an eye on
the newchilds basket We want to
be certain he doesnt wiggle
himself loose

Jonas collects his schoolbooks Father and Lily scoop up
Gabe in his basket and head out the front door

MOTHER
Wait Jonas Ill write an apology
to your instructor so that you
wont have to speak for being
late

Jonas retakes his seat his face a mask of apprehension

MOTHER
Jonas the feeling you described
as the wanting It was your first
Stirrings Father and I have been
expecting it to happen to you for

some time It happens to everyone

It happened to Father when he was

your age and it happened to me

too It will happen to Lily one

day And very often For the rest

MOTHER (contd)
of your life

JONAS

Mother laughs lightly at Jonas concern

MOTHER
You did The dream-telling was
enough

JONAS

son

MOTHER
No no its just the pills

his successor We have had our
current Receiver for a very long
time

ancient and bearded with a pair of solemn pale eyes that
stare right into Jonas He is THE GIVER

It was ten years ago when Jonas
was just a toddler But I will not
dwell on the experience because
it causes us all terrible
discomfort We have not been hasty
this time We could not afford
another failure The
Receiver-in-training cannot be
observed cannot be modified That
is stated quite clearly in the
rules He is to be alone apart
while he is prepared by the
current Receiver for the job which
is most honored in our community

choice of the Committee Jonas was

CHIEF ELDER
Jonas the training required of
you involves pain Physical pain
You have never experienced that
Yes you have scraped your knees
falling off your bicycle Yes you
crushed your finger in a door last
year But you will be faced now
with pain of a magnitude that none
of us here can comprehend because
it is beyond our experience We
cannot prepare you for that but
we feel certain that you are
brave Finally the Receiver spoke
of a quality and it is one I can
only name but not describe None
of us here will understand it but
perhaps Jonas will The Receiver
told us that Jonas has a quality
The capacity to see beyond

Jonas casts his pale eyes over the paralyzed audience

Shades of

pink dance on their skin but only in flashes

only for a moment

become our next Receiver of

I understand Everything is so
different now

FIONA
Yes Well I dont want to be
late If we finish at the same
time Ill ride home with you

JONAS
Of course

EXT ANNEX - DAY

Jonas punches a buzzer on the door A voice emanates from a
speaker on the building
VOICE FROM SPEAKER (VO)

Yes

JONAS
Its uh Jonas Im the new - I
mean --

VOICE FROM SPEAKER (VO)
Come in

The heavy door clicks open

INT ANNEX LOBBY - DAY

Jonas walks up to a female ATTENDANT behind a desk As soon
as she sees Jonas she respectfully rises to her feet

ATTENDANT
Welcome Receiver of Memory

JONAS
Oh please Call me Jonas

The attendant smiles at Jonas then presses a button at her
desk that triggers a door down the hall to unlock with a
loud CLICK

ATTENDANT
You may go right on in

Jonas looks at her shocked

ATTENDANT
The locks are simply to ensure the
Receivers privacy It would be
difficult if citizens wandered in
looking for the Department of
Bicycle Repair or something

Jonas laughs relaxing a little

ATTENDANT
There is nothing dangerous here
but he doesnt like to be kept
waiting

Jonas hurries down the hall and through the unlocked door

INT THE GIVERS ROOM - DAY

Jonas enters the room and freezes in his tracks The
standard desk table and bed are present but their
craftsmanship is strikingly more ornate than the norm

Thick luxurious fabrics cover the furniture the bed frame
is decorated oak all four walls are bookcases packed from
ceiling to floor with countless volumes
Jonas quickly snaps out of his stare as he notices the
Giver watching him from his seat across the room Jonas
steps toward him and bows slightly

JONAS
Im Jonas
THE GIVER
I know Welcome Receiver of

Memory
Jonas stares at the Givers pale eyes for a BEAT

JONAS
Sir I apologize for my lack of
understanding

The Giver remains silent still

JONAS
But I thought - I mean I
think that you are the Receiver of
Memory Im only well I was
only assigned I mean selected
yesterday Im not anything at
all Not yet

The Giver collects his thoughts

THE GIVER
Beginning today this moment at
least to me you are the Receiver
I have been the Receiver for a
very long time A very long time
You can see that cant you

JONAS
I can see that you are very old

The Giver smiles and strokes his beard

THE GIVER
I am not actually as old as I
look This job has aged me I
know I look as if I should be
scheduled for release very soon
but I actually have a good deal of
time left I was pleased though
when you were selected It took
them a long time The failure of
the previous selection was ten
years ago and my energy is
starting to diminish I need what
strength I have remaining for your
training We have painful work to
do you and I Please sit down
Jonas lowers himself onto the elegant cushioning of a nearby
chair The Giver holds his tired eyes closed then abruptly
snaps them open

THE GIVER

You may ask questions I have so
little experience in describing
this process It is forbidden to
talk of it I may neglect to make
things as clear as I should so
feel free to ask me anything that
may help you

Jonas searches his mind then shrugs his shoulders

THE GIVER
Simply stated although its not
really simple at all my job is to
transmit to you all the memories I
have within me --

JONAS
-- Sir I would be very interested
to hear the story of your life and
to listen to your memories I
apologize for interrupting

THE GIVER
No apologies in this room We
havent time

JONAS
Well I am interested I dont
mean that Im not but I dont
exactly understand why its so
important I could do some adult
job in the community and in my
recreation time I could come and

(MORE)

JONAS (contd)
listen to the stories from your
childhood Id like that
Actually I al--

THE GIVER
-- No no no Im not being
clear Its not my past that I
must transmit to you Its the
memories of the whole world
Jonas Before you before me
before the previous Receiver and
generations before him

Jonas takes a second to think before he responds

JONAS
I - I dont understand Im
sorry sir Do you mean not just
the community Do you mean
Elsewhere too Im sorry maybe
Im not smart enough I dont
know what you mean when you say
those things I thought there was
only us I thought there was only

now

THE GIVER
Theres much more Theres all
that goes beyond - all that is
Elsewhere - and all that goes

back and back

and back I

received all of those when I was
selected and here in this room
all alone I re-experience them
again and again It is how wisdom
comes And how we shape our
future I am so weighted with

them

The Giver pauses to rest
concern

Jonas looks at him with genuine

THE GIVER

Its as if

Its like going

downhill through snow on a sled
At first its exhilarating the
speed the sharp clear air but
then the snow accumulates builds
up on the runners and you slow
you have to push hard to keep

going and

The Giver shakes his head and scans Jonas

THE GIVER
That meant nothing to you did it

JONAS
I didnt understand it sir

THE GIVER
Of course you didnt You dont

know what snow

Jonas shakes his head

is do you

THE GIVER
Or a sled Runners

JONAS

No sir

THE GIVER
Really The terms mean nothing to

you Not even

JONAS

Nothing

sir

THE GIVER
Well its a place to start Id
been wondering how to begin Move
to the bed and lie face down
Remove your tunic first

Jonas rises from his seat removes his tunic and places
himself face down on the Givers bed

The Giver moves to a speaker-box on the wall and deftly
switches it OFF He stations himself in a seat beside
Jonas

THE GIVER
Close your eyes Relax This
will not be painful

JONAS
What are you going to do sir

THE GIVER
I am going to transmit the memory
of snow

The Giver places his hands firmly on Jonas bare back After
a anxious moment Jonas begins to SHIVER and his teeth begin
to CHATTER

EXT SNOWY HILL - NIGHT

Jonas eyes closed sits atop a sled on the peak of a
towering mound of powdery snow He sticks out his tongue

and smiles as he catches the gentle snowflakes drifting down
from the black sky

Jonas reaches down and picks up the sleds damp rope as the
swirling crystals accumulate on his body

He snaps his eyes open and the sled tips forward and begins
racing down the hill

The runners cut rapidly through the frost jetting Jonas
downward faster and faster The young boy smiles in
ecstasy as the wind whips wildly against his face

As Jonas reaches the bottom of the hill and the incline
disappears snow accumualtes beneath the runners and the
sled comes to a slow stop

Jonas thrusts his body forward on the sled trying to force
the ride to commence

BACK TO THE GIVERS ROOM

The Giver pulls his hands from the boys back and Jonas
eyes flutter open

THE GIVER
How do you feel
JONAS
Surprised

Jonas sits up on the bed

The Giver

THE GIVER
It was exhausting But you know
even transmitting that tiny memory
to you I think it lightened
me just a little

JONAS
Do you mean - Did you say I could
ask questions

nods enthusiastically

JONAS
Do you mean that now you no longer
have that memory

THE GIVER
Thats right A little weight off
this old body

JONAS
But it was such fun And I took
it from you

THE GIVER
All I gave you was one ride on
one sled in one snow on one
hill I have a whole world of
them in my memory I could give
them to you one by one a thousand
times and there would still be
more

JONAS
Are you saying that I - I mean
that we could do it again Id
really like to I think I could
steer by pulling the rope I
didnt know to try this time

THE GIVER
Maybe another day for a treat
But theres no time really just
to play I only wanted to begin
by showing you how it works Now
lie back down I want--

-- Jonas hops belly-first onto the bed

JONAS
Why dont we have snow and sleds
and hills And when did we in
the past Did my parents have

sleds when they were young Did
you

THE GIVER
No Its a very distant memory
Thats why it was so exhausting I
had to tug it forward from many
generations back

JONAS
But what happened to those things
The snow and the rest of it

THE GIVER
Climate Control Snow made
growing food difficult limited
the agricultural periods And
unpredictable weather made
transportation impossible at
times It wasnt a practical
thing so it became obsolete when
we went to Sameness The hills
made conveyance of goods unwieldy
and so Sameness

JONAS
I wish we had those things still
Just now and then

THE GIVER
So do I But that choice is not
ours

JONAS
But sir since you have so much
power--

THE GIVER

-- Honor I have great honor and
one day so will you Thats not
the same as power Lie quietly
now Let me give you something
else And this time Im not going
to tell you the name of it
because I want to test the
receiving I gave away snow and
sled the first time but you
should be able to perceive the
name without being told a word

The Giver places his hands on the boys back

EXT BEACH - DAY

Jonas outstretched on the sand soaks up the sunshine He
smiles at the warmth Then as the bright rays beat down on
his body he winces and touches his skin
JONAS
Ouch

BACK TO THE GIVERS ROOM

Jonas sits up wincing in discomfort He touches the skin
on his neck

JONAS
Its - its a sunburn It hurts a
lot
THE GIVER

I started you out with pleasure
My previous failure gave me the
wisdom to do that You must
understand It will be
painful Jonas

JONAS
I understand

THE GIVER
Get up now You may return home
thats enough for the first day
You were in the memories longer
than you realize Well do much
longer sessions in the future

Jonas gets off the bed and puts his tunic back on

JONAS
Goodbye sir Thank you for my
first day

The Giver nods Jonas moves to leave but then

JONAS
Sir

THE GIVER
Do you have a question

JONAS
Its just that I dont know your
name You say now Im the
Receiver so I dont know what to
call you

The old man shifts his aching shoulders around in his plush
chair

THE GIVER
Call me The Giver
INT JONAS SLEEPING-ROOM - NIGHT

Jonas lies asleep in bed bundled beneath his blanket with
a satisfied smile on his face

EXT SNOWY HILL - NIGHT

On the sled Jonas zips down the hill

INT JONAS DWELLING - DINING AREA - DAY
The family unit is having their morning meal together

MOTHER
And you slept soundly
Jonas No dreams

Jonas smiles to himself

JONAS
I slept very soundly

FATHER
Well I wish this one would

Father points to Gabriel who is situated in his basket on
the floor COOING at and playing with his stuffed hippo

MOTHER
So do I Hes been so fretful at
night

The newchild giggles at his stuffed animal then sneezes
adorably

EXT THE HOUSE OF THE OLD - DAY
Jonas and Fiona pedal up to the building together

FIONA
I looked for you yesterday so we
could ride home together Your
bike was still there and I waited
for a little while But it was
getting late so I went on home

JONAS
I apologize for making you wait

FIONA
I accept your apology

JONAS
I stayed a little longer than I
expected

A MOMENT OF SILENCE They pedal onward
JONAS

Youve been doing so many

volunteer hours with the Old
There wont be much that you dont

already know

FIONA

Oh theres lots to learn

Theres

administrative work dietary
rules punishment for disobedience
- did you know they use the same
discipline wand on the Old the
same as for small children And
theres occupational therapy and
medications and I think I
like it a lot better than school

JONAS
Me too

They hit their brakes as they reach the designated bike

ports

Jonas and Fiona stare at each other for an awkward BEAT

then

FIONA
Goodbye

They wave goodbye Fiona spins away from Jonas and hurries
through the buildings front entrance

As she turns away in her haste her long locks of hair flip
up into the air before falling back around her shoulders In
mid-air the strands of Fionas hair adopt a PASSIONATE RED

HUE But only for a second

She disappears behind the entrance
moves on

INT THE GIVERS ROOM - DAY

and a bewildered Jonas

Jonas enters the room The Giver smiles at him

THE GIVER

Welcome We must get started

Youre one minute late

JONAS
I apologi--

Jonas cuts himself off then removes his tunic and moves to

the bed

JONAS

Im one minute late because
something happened And Id like
to ask you about it if you dont

mind
THE GIVER
You may ask me anything

JONAS
I think its what you call seeing
beyond

THE GIVER
Describe it

JONAS

Just now outside it happened
with my friend Fiona Not her
just something about her I
think her hair it was
different Not the shape or - or
in length I dont know I-I -
It just --

Jonas pauses in frustration

JONAS
It changed I dont know how

THE GIVER
When I gave you the memory
yesterday the first one did you
look around Did you look at the
sled

JONAS
Ye-- No I felt it under me

The Giver ponders

THE GIVER
Lie down

Jonas does so and shuts his eyes tight

THE GIVER
Call back the memory of the ride
on the hill just the beginning of
it And this time look down at
the sled

Jonas opens his eyes

JONAS
Excuse me but dont you have to
place your hands on my back

THE GIVER
Its your memory now Its no
longer mine to give

JONAS
How do I call it
THE GIVER
Well you can remember last year
or the year you were a Seven or
Five cant you

JONAS
Of course

THE GIVER
Its much the same Just

concentrate

Jonas shuts his eyes again

EXT

SNOWY HILL - NIGHT

Jonas sits on the sled atop the hill A world of snowflakes
swirl about him

He blows his steamy breathe into the air and watches it
float away with childlike delight

Then

he looks down at the sled The wood of the structure

is painted CRIMSON the same distinct shade as the apple and
Fionas hair

Jonas blinks at it and the color does not waver it simply
is It is a red sled

BACK TO THE GIVERS ROOM

Jonas sits up on the bed The Giver watches him curiously

JONAS
I saw it In the sled

THE GIVER
Youre beginning to see the color
red

Jonas stares at the old man dumbfounded

THE GIVER
Uh back before the time of
Sameness back in the time of
memories everything had a shape
and size the way they still do
but they also had another quality
called color There were many
colors and one of them was called
red Thats the one youre
starting to see Your friend
Fiona has red hair - quite
distinctive actually Ive
noticed it before myself

JONAS
At the Ceremony I saw it happen
in the faces of the audience
THE GIVER
Yes - well no Flesh isnt red
but it has red tones in it There
was a time actually - youll see
in the memories later - when flesh
was many different colors That
was before we went to Sameness
The faces you saw Im sure
werent as deep or vibrant as your
friends hair Weve never
completely mastered Sameness I
suppose the genetic scientists are
still working out the kinks Hair
like Fionas must drive them
crazy

JONAS
The color on the sled Giver it
didnt change It just was

THE GIVER
Thats because it was a memory
from when color just was

The Giver

JONAS
It was so Giver the red was
so beautiful Do you see it all
the time

THE GIVER
All of them I see all of them
You will when you receive my
memories Youll gain wisdom
then the colors And so much
more

JONAS
Why cant everyone see them

THE GIVER
Our people made that choice to go
to Sameness Before my time
before the previous time and
back and back and back We
relinquished color when we
relinquished sunshine and did away
with differences We gained
control of many things but we had
to do away with others

JONAS
We shouldnt have

is startled by Jonas outburst
THE GIVER

Youve come very quickly to that
conclusion It took me many

years Lie back down now We
have so much to do

Jonas obliges
THE GIVER
Close your eyes and be still now
Im going to give you a memory of
a rainbow

BEGIN MONTAGE

EXT BLACK VOID

Infinite darkness A single shaft of light shoots across
the frame Then another and another COLORS fill the

shafts The entire frame becomes populated by a rainbow of

heavenly hues

INT THE GIVERS ROOM - DAY

JONAS
But its all the same always I
mean I know its not important if
you put on a red tunic or a blue
one but

THE GIVER
Its the freedom thats important
isnt it

JONAS
Yes Exactly

THE GIVER
Well consider this what if you
chose wrong with something that is
important in the community

Jonas calms down

JONAS
Like if we allowed people to
choose their own mate That
wouldnt be safe

THE GIVER
Why not Not safe

JONAS
Its Oh I see It doesnt
matter when its a child choosing
between certain toys but we cant
let people choose their own
spouses or jobs What if they
choose wrong

THE GIVER
Frightening

44
JONAS
I suppose They would be stuck in
those positions I suppose we
have to protect people from wrong
choices

THE GIVER
Its safer

JONAS
Yes Much safer

THE GIVER
Very well then

TIME CUT

The Giver places his hands on Jonas back

EXT SOMEWHERE IN AFRICA - DAY

Jonas is in a land of sparse grass and rocks The CRACK of
a FIRING RIFLE resounds Jonas catches the glimpse of a
massive elephant CRASHING to the ground

A group of POACHERS some of them with DARK BROWN SKIN
emerge from the shrubbery They approach the fallen giant
and begin hacking at its tusks with sharpened machetes

Jets of STARTLINGLY RED BLOOD blanket the surrounding
terrain

The men take the tusks and speed off in an off-road vehicle
Another elephant emerges from some thick vegetation and

covers the body of its comrade with a bundle of branches
The grieving animal ROARS into the empty landscape

INT JONAS DWELLING - LIVING AREA - DAY

Jonas watches Lily play with her comfort object a stuffed
elephant

JONAS
Lily did you know that once there
really were elephants Live ones

Lily rolls her eys

LILY

on his knees writhing in pain
THE GIVER
Come back tomorrow Im in great
pain today

Jonas leaves

BLACK VOID

LIGHTNING CRACKS violently across the frame

EXT CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY

Jonas and Asher walk along a landscaped lawn with a bush of
BRIGHT RED roses Jonas stops Asher and presses his hands
against his back

JONAS
Look

Jonas stares at the roses Asher looks around puzzled
then steps away from Jonas hands

ASHER
Whats the matter

JONAS
No nothing I thought for a
minute that they were wilting and
we should let the Gardening Crew
know they needed more watering
THE GIVERS ROOM

The Giver places his hands on Jonas back

INT SUBURBAN HOME - DAY
FAMILY and FRIENDS are gathered around a YOUNG BOY sitting
at a table A chocolate cake with thick frosting bearing a
name and nine candles is the centerpiece
Everyone SINGS a song directed toward the child
Jonas watches from the back of the room
THE GIVERS ROOM
Some of the books lining the walls are now in FULL COLOR
JONAS
Do you advise the Committee of
Elders often

Rarely Not nearly as often as I

should There are so many things
I could tell them but they dont
want to change I wish they did

EXT LUSH

An unreal

THE GIVER (contd)
Life here is just so painless
Its what theyve chosen

JONAS
I dont see why they even need a
Receiver then

THE GIVER
They need me And you They were
reminded of that ten years ago
with the failure of my successor

JONAS
Why did that remind them

THE GIVER
When the new Receiver failed the
memories that she had received
were released They went

waves his hand airily

THE GIVER
I dont know exactly They didnt
return to me They went out to
the community everyone had access
to the memories It was chaos
They suffered until it subsided as
the memories assimilated but it
reminded them just how much they
needed me to contain all that
pain And knowledge

JONAS
But you have to suffer like that
all the time

nods

As will you

places his hands on Jonas back

Giver what causes you pain

The Giver remains silent Jonas continues

JONAS
The Chief Elder told me the
memories would bring me great
pain I havent suffered I
remember the sunburn but it
wasnt so terrible I have to see
you suffer Maybe if you gave
some to me your pain would be
less

THE GIVER
Lie down

Jonas removes his tunic and follows the order
THE GIVER
All right Well start with
something familiar Lets go once

again to a hill anda sled

The Giver places his hands on Jonas back

EXT ANOTHER SNOWY HILL - NIGHT
This hill is steep and the snowfall hard and jagged

The sled Jonas atop it slides forward and tips off the
apex of the hill The runners SCRAPE the ice as it drops
downward picking up acceleration

The sled slips and Jonas loses control A bump on the hill
launches his body one way and the sled another Jonas
flies through space and lands on a patch of unforgiving ice

The unmistakable CRACK of bone ECHOES across the tundra
Jonas lay still his faced smashed into the blue He GASPS
ALOUD then turns his head and vomits onto the cold canvas

He SCREAMS then begins SOBBING

Steam rises from both the patch of bubbling vomit and the
gaping hole in his leg

BACK TO THE GIVERS ROOM

Jonas sits up his face wet with tears He rubs his
unbroken leg

JONAS
May I have a relief-of-pain pill
please

The Giver shakes his head apologetically

THE GIVER
Im sorry

Jonas hangs his head and grimaces in pain

JONAS
Why Why do you and I have to
hold these memories

THE GIVER
It gives us wisdom Without
wisdom I could not fulfill my
function of advising the Committee
of Elders when they call upon me
The Giver

JONAS
But what wisdom do you get from
pain

sighs and collects his thoughts

THE GIVER
Some time ago before your birth
a lot of citizens petitioned the
Committee of Elders They wanted
to increase birth rates They
wanted each Birthmother to be
assigned an extra birth so that
the population would increase and
there would be more Laborers
available

JONAS
That makes sense

THE GIVER
The idea was that certain family
units could accommodate an
additional child

JONAS
Mine could We have Gabriel this
year and its fun having a third
child

THE GIVER
The Committee of Elders sought my
advice It made sense to them
too but it was a new idea and
they came to me for wisdom

JONAS
And you used your memories

THE GIVER
And the strongest memory that came
back to me was hunger It came
from many generations back
Centuries back The population
had gotten so big that hunger was
everywhere Excruciating hunger
and starvation It was followed
by warfare

JONAS
So you described that to them

THE GIVER
They dont want to hear about
pain They just seek the advice
I simply advised them against
increasing the population

Jonas holds his leg

JONAS
What does the word warfare mean

THE GIVER
Youll learn soon enough But it
means destruction I suppose

JONAS
Destruction Why - But why cant
everyone hold a little bit of the
pain If we all shared the
memories wouldnt the pain be
less

THE GIVER
Yes But then everyone would be
burdened and pained and thats
not what they want Its not what
theyve chosen We carry the
burden for our community Its
the real reason you and I are so
honored

EXT AREA OF DWELLINGS - DAY

Jonas limps homeward pushing his bike along the path at his
side

INT JONAS DWELLING - LIVING AREA - NIGHT

The family unit is gathered around baby Gabriel Jonas sits
at the desk studying

FATHER
After all this extra time Ive put
in with him I hope they dont
release him

MOTHER
Maybe it would be for the best I
know you dont mind getting up
with him but the lack of sleep is
awfully hard for me

Lily waves Gabriels stuffed hippo for him to see

LILY
If they release Gabe could we get
another newchild as a visitor

FATHER
No Lily-billy its very rare
that it happens anyway It
probably wont happen again for a
long time Anyway Gabriels
release wont be discussed anytime
soon Were preparing for a
Birthmother whos expecting twins

MOTHER
Oh dear If theyre identical I
hope youre not assigned

FATHER
Iam Im next on the list Its
not a difficult decision though
Ill just look at the birthweight
and simply release the smaller of
the two

Jonas looks up from the desk

JONAS
Mother Father Why dont we
just put Gabriels crib in my room
tonight I know how to care for
him It would let the two of you
get some sleep

INT JONAS SLEEPING-ROOM - NIGHT

Jonas sleeps soundly in his bed Gabriel in his crib
begins fidgeting beneath his covers The newchild starts to
WHIMPER

Jonas wakes up and attends to Gabe He places his hand on
the boys back and begins patting him rhythmically Still
patting the child back to sleep Jonas shuts his tired eyes
EXT LAKE - DAY

A gentle wind carries a sailboat across clear turquoise
water Jonas rides in the boat the brisk air combing

through his hair

Suddenly his smile disappears as the water becomes murky
the boat slows and the sky above him dims

BACK TO JONAS SLEEPING-ROOM

Jonas rips his hand from Gabriels back and leaps toward his
bed frightened The baby is suddenly calm completely
peaceful staring off into space with his PALE EYES

BACK TO THE LAKE

The scene is just as vivid as it once was with Gabriel
sailing in the boat GIGGLING MERRILY

BACK TO JONAS SLEEPING-ROOM

Jonas sits still in the dark Gabriel falls back to sleep
INT THE GIVERS ROOM - DAY

Jonas enters and immediately sees the Giver hunched in his
chair wincing in pain

JONAS
Ill come back tomorrow sir

Jonas turns to leave The Giver GASPS in agony

THE GIVER
Please

Jonas turns back The Givers face is contorted by the
suffering

THE GIVER
take some of the pain

EXT BATTLEFIELD - DAY

All around Jonas fallen SOLDIERS lay either dead or near
death SOUNDS OF FIREARMS BOOM in the distance

A wild horse charges across the expanse WHINNYING in panic
before it crashes to the dirt and does not rise again

SOLDIER (0OC)
Water

Jonas looks over and sees a soldier not much older than
himself The boy soldier is bloody and beaten The colors

of carnage are disturbingly BRIGHT on his person CRIMSON on
the boys chest shreds of GREEN grass in his YELLOW hair

Jonas now notices that his own body is outstretched across
the blood-soaked earth He is wearing a gray uniform the
same as the yellow-haired soldiers and a splintered bone
is protruding through the skin on his elbow

SOLDIER
Water

As the boy pleads again a fresh spurt of RED is ejected
from his mouth

Jonas reaches with his unwounded arm for the metal container
on his hip He manages to unscrew the cap with his teeth
and bring it to his comrades lips Jonas pours water into
the soldiers mouth down his grimy chin

THE THUD OF CANNONS BANG in the distance VOICES OF MEN CRY
OUT Wounded horses on their backs stab randomly at the
air with their hooves

The young soldier next to Jonas closes his eyes and dies

BACK TO THE GIVERS ROOM
The Giver pulls his hands from Jonas back and turns away in
shame

THE GIVER
Forgive me

INT JONAS DWELLING - LIVING AREA - DAY

The family unit stirs about getting set to leave the
dwelling and begin their days

SPEAKER (VO)
Today is declared an unscheduled
holiday

They all stop in their tracks and turn to the speaker-box
from which the message came

FATHER
Well alright

Jonas drops his folders back on the desk They all smile in
excitement

EXT THE BRIDGE - DAY

Jonas speeds over the cobblestone bridge

EXT PLAYING FIELD - DAY

A large group of CHILDREN of various ages frolic through the
sizable plot of grass and trees LAUGHING and SCREAMING with
delight

Jonas rides up to the field and tosses his bike alongside
one of the many other bicycles strewn about the area He
spots Asher playing with the other children

JONAS
(calling out)
Asher Hey Ash

Too busy with his game to hear his friend Asher ducks
behind a bush Jonas steps onto the field and one of the
children leaps in front of him holding his hand in the
shape of a gun

CHILD
Bang Bang Bang

Another child streaks by and pretends to shoot the kid who
shot at Jonas

OTHER CHILD
Psssheeewwww

The first child dramatically grabs his chest and collapses
to the ground Jonas watches uneasily

CHILD
You got me

Suddenly Asher leaps from behind a tree and shoots Jonas
with his fingers

ASHER
Blam Youre in my line of
ambush Jonas Blam blam

Jonas steps back as Asher charges by him Another group of
children appear at the other end of the playing field Jonas
notices that Fiona is one of them

FIONA
Attack

Asher and the others on this side of the field hold their
imaginary firearms poised

ASHER
Couter-attack

The two groups of players converge in the center of the
field and exchange explosion sound effects and hand
gestures Before long most of the children throw
themselves on the grass shot

Jonas complexion takes on a sallow tone He virtually
sleepwalks toward the action on the field

ASHER
Pow Youre hit Jonas Pow
Youre hit again

Jonas doesnt throw himself down The numerous hit
children on the ground look up at him quizzically The few
still firing stop and watch

Jonas breathing SHUDDERS He struggles to fight back the
tears The children look at each other nervously before
awkwardly walking away to another game

They leave until only Asher and Fiona remain staring
perplexed at Jonas paralyzed body

FIONA
Whats wrong Jonas Its only a
game

ASHER

You ruined it

JONAS
Dont play it anymore
ASHER
Im the one whos training for
Assistant Recreation Director
Games arent your area of
expertness

JONAS
Expertise

ASHER
You cant say what we play even
if you are going to be the new
Receiver

BEAT

ASHER
I apologize for not paying you the
respect you deserve

JONAS
Asher you had no way of knowing
this but its a cruel game In
the past--

ASHER
-- I said I apologize Jonas

JONAS
I accept your apology

FIONA
Do you want to go for a ride along

the river Jonas

Jonas looks at his gentle female friend Her blazing red
hair makes her appear lovelier than ever

JONAS
No I-Im sorry no I

Fiona nods along hiding her surprise She goes off with
Asher and they find their bicycles and take off together

Jonas hangs his head

INT JONAS DWELLING - DINING AREA - NIGHT

The family unit is gathered around the table for the evening
meal

LILY
I cant wait till the ceremonies
in a few months so I can finally
become a Nine and get my very own
bicycle Fathers is too big for
me I fell Good thing Gabe
wasnt in the - wasnt in the
child seat

MOTHER
A very good thing

Little Gabe walks freely around the table with his newly
developing legs He giggles at the mention of his name

GABRIEL
Gay Gay

Its how the child pronounces his own name and it brings a
small smile to Jonas weary face

FATHER
Well I want to get to sleep
early Tomorrows a busy day for
me The twins are being born ina
few days and early test results
are showing that theyre
identical I have to get up
early and go confirm what we
believe in the morning

LILY
One for here one for Elsewhere

JONAS
Do you actually take it Elsewhere
Father

FATHER

No I just have to make the
selection I weigh them hand the
larger one over to a Nurturer
whos standing by waiting and
then I get the smaller one all
cleaned up and comfortable Then
I perform a small Ceremony of
Release

Father looks down at Gabriel

FATHER (contd)
(baby voice)
Then I wave bye-bye

Father waves at Gabe who raises his chubby little hand and
returns the gesture

GABRIEL
Bye-bye

JONAS
And somebody else comes to get
him Somebody from Elsewhere

FATHER
Thats right
LILY
What if they give the little twin
a name Elsewhere a name like oh
maybe Jonathan And here in our
community at his naming the twin
that we kept is given the name
Jonathan and then there would be
two children with the same name
and they would look exactly the
same and someday maybe when they
were a Six a group of Sixes would
go to visit another community on a
bus and there in the other
community in the other group of
Sixes would be a Jonathan who was
exactly the same as the other
Jonathan and then maybe they
would get mixed up and take the
wrong Jonathan home and maybe his
parents wouldnt notice

Lily pauses to catch her breath

MOTHER
Lily I have a wonderful idea
Maybe when you become a Twelve
theyll give you the Assignment of
Storyteller I dont think weve
had a Storyteller in the community
for a long time

LILY
I have a better idea for one more
story What if actually we were
all twins and didnt know it and
(MORE)

LILY (contd)
so Elsewhere there would be
another Lily and another Jonas
and another Mother and Father and
another Chief Elder --

FATHER
-- Lily I think its bedtime

INT THE GIVERS ROOM - DAY
Jonas and the Giver sit across from each other

THE GIVER
There are so many good memories

JONAS
Whats your favorite You dont
have to give it away yet Just
describe it so I can look forward
to it
The Giver smiles
THE GIVER
Lie down Im happy to give it to
you
Jonas obeys his mentor The Giver places his hands on the
boys bare back

INT WARM HOME - DAY

A room filled with a FAMILY A firelight glows on a hearth
It is visible through a window that it is snowing outside

Colored lights GREEN and RED sparkle around a pine tree
surrounded by wrapped packages

A pair of children begin passing the packages around to a
pair of adults who are obviously parents and also a much
older couple man and woman

They all begin unwrapping the packages

BACK TO THE GIVERS ROOM

THE GIVER
What did you perceive

Jonas sits up on the bed

JONAS
Warmth And family I-It
was some celebration a holiday
Who were the old people Why were
they there

THE GIVER
They were called Grandparents

JONAS
Grand parents

THE GIVER
Grandparents It meant
parents-of-the-parents long ago

JONAS
Back and back and back So
actually there could be
parents-of-the-parents-of-the-parents

THE GIVER
Thats right

JONAS
But my parents mustve had
parents too I never thought of
that before Who are they
THE GIVER
You could look it up in the Hall
of Open Records Youd find the
names But think son If you
apply for children then who will
be their grandparents

JONAS
Well my parents of course

THE GIVER
And where will they be

JONAS
Oh when I finish my training
and become a full adult Ill be
given my own dwelling And
eventually after Lily does then
Mother and Father --

THE GIVER
-- Thats right

JONAS
Theyll go live with the Childless
Adults and they wont be a part
of my life anymore As long as
theyre still working and
contributing to the community

THE GIVER
And when the time comes theyll
go to the House of the Old

JONAS
And theyll be well cared for and
respected and when theyre
released there will be a
celebration

THE GIVER
Which you wont attend

JONAS
No of course not because I wont
even know about it By then Ill
be so busy with my own life And
Lily will too If we choose to
apply for children and get them
theyll never know who their
parents-of-the-parents are
either It seems to work pretty
well that way in our community
doesnt it

THE GIVER
It works yes

JONAS
I certainly liked the memory I

can see why its your favorite I
couldnt quite get the word for
the whole feeling of it the
feeling that was so strong in the

room
THE GIVER
Love
A MOMENT passes
JONAS
Giver
THE GIVER
Yes
JONAS
I feel very foolish saying this
Very --
THE GIVER

-- No need Nothing is foolish
here Trust the memories and how
they make you feel

JONAS
Well I know you dont have the
memory anymore so you may not
understand

THE GIVER
I will I still have many
memories of family and holidays
and happiness Of love

JONAS
I was thinking that well I
can see that it wasnt a very
practical way to live with the
Old right there in the same place
and maybe they wouldnt be taken
care of like they should And the
fire burning right there in the
room It was certainly a
dangerous way to live but I was
thinking - I mean feeling
actually that it was kind of nice
then I wish that we could be
that way If only just
occasionally Maybe you could
even be my grandparent Its just
- the family in the memory seemed
a little more

THE GIVER
A little more complete

Jonas nods his head in agreement
INT JONAS DWELLING - DINING AREA - NIGHT

The family unit is just finishing up their evening meal For
the very first time EVERYTHING on screen is in FULL VIBRANT
COLOR

JONAS
Mother Father I have a
question to ask you

FATHER
What is it Jonas

He takes a second to build up his mettle

JONAS
Do you love me

SILENCE until an uncomfortable CHUCKLE escapes Father

FATHER
Jonas you of all people
Precision of language please

JONAS
What

MOTHER
Your father means you used a very
generalized word so meaningless
its become almost obsolete And
of course our community cant
function smoothly if people dont
use precise language You could
ask Do you enjoy me The
answer is of course Yes

FATHER
Or Do you take pride in my
accomplishments And the answer
is wholeheartedly Yes

MOTHER
Do you understand why its
inappropriate to use a word like
love

INSERT THE SHEET OF PAPER

from Jonas Assignment folder Focus in on number eight
You may lie

Jonas looks at his parents with manufactured sincerity
JONAS

Yes thank you I do

INT JONAS SLEEPING-ROOM - NIGHT
Jonas tucks sleepy-eyed Gabe into his crib He whispers

JONAS

Gabriel Things could change
They could be different They
should I dont know how Gabe
but they can There could be
colors in the world again And
grandparents Everyone could have

memories I

know you already know

about the memories

The baby is falling fast asleep Jonas watches over him

INT JONAS DWELLING - DINING AREA - NIGHT

Mother swallows her pill for the Stirrings

INT JONAS DWELLING - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Jonas stands over the sink staring at his bottle of pills
He twists off the cap and pours all of the tablets down the

drain

INT THE GIVERS ROOM - DAY

Jonas is laying prone on the bed He looks up at the Giver

with his solemn eyes

JONAS
Giver Do you ever think about
release

THE GIVER

Do you mean my own release or
just the general topic of release

JONAS
Both I guess I apologi- I mean
I should have been more precise
But I dont know exactly what I
meant

THE GIVER
Sit back up
Jonas does so The Giver takes a moment to mull it

The Giver

The Giver

THE GIVER
I guess I do think about it
occasionally I think about it
when Im in an awful lot of pain
I wish I could put in a request
for it sometimes and just give
myself over to its cold embrace

JONAS
How do you mean cold Like the
snowy hill

studies Jonas

THE GIVER
No Jonas not exactly But
either way Im not permitted to
apply for release until the new
Receiver is trained

JONAS
Me neither I cant put ina
request for my release It was in
my rules

THE GIVER
I am aware They hammered out
those rules after the failure ten
years ago

JONAS
Giver tell me what happened
Please

shrugs his shoulders

THE GIVER
On the surface it was quite
simple A Receiver-to-be was
selected the way you were The
selection went smoothly enough
The Ceremony was held and the
selection was made The crowd
cheered as they did for you The
new Receiver was puzzled and a
little frightened as you were

over

The Giver

JONAS
My parents told me it was a
female
nods

JONAS

What was she like

The Giver

THE GIVER
She was a truly remarkable young
woman Very self-possessed and
serene Stunning eyes She was
intelligent eager to learn You
know Jonas when she came to me
in this room when she--

JONAS
-- Can you tell me her name My
parents said that it wasnt to be
spoken again in the community

almost winces as if in pain

THE GIVER
Her name was Rosemary

JONAS
Rosemary I like that name

THE GIVER
When she came to me for the first
time she sat there in the chair
where you sat on your first day
We talked I tried to explain
things as well as I could The
whole thing is so beyond ones
experience but I tried And she
listened Her eyes were very
luminous I remember I loved
her I feel the same way of you
Jonas

JONAS
What happened to her

THE GIVER
Her training began She received
well as you do She was so
enthusiastic So delighted to
experience new things I remember
her laughter

The Giver

s eyes well with tears

JONAS
What happened

THE GIVER
It broke my heart Jonas to
transfer pain to her Five weeks
that was all I gave her happy
memories a ride on a
merry-go-round a kitten to play
with a picnic Sometimes I chose
one just because I knew it would
make her laugh But she was like
you Jonas She wanted to
experience everything And she

The Giver

asked me for more difficult
memories

JONAS
You didnt give her war after just
five weeks did you

THE GIVER
No And I didnt give her
physical pain But I gave her
loneliness and loss I
transferred a memory of a child
being taken from its parents That
was the first one She appeared
stunned at its end I backed off
gave her more little delights But
everything changed once she knew
about pain I could see it in
those eyes

JONAS
She wasnt brave enough

takes a deep breath before continuing

THE GIVER
She insisted that I continue that
I not spare her She said it was
her duty And I knew of course
that she was correct I couldnt
bring myself to inflict physical
pain on her but I gave her
anguish of many kinds Poverty
and hunger and terror I had to
Jonas It was my job and she had
been chosen

The Giver

wipes his tears

THE GIVER
Finally one afternoon we
finished for the day It had been
a hard session I had to catch up
and transfer many memories at one
time I tried - as I do with you
- to finish the day with something
cheerful She stood up very
silently then she walked over and
put her arms around me She
kissed my cheek She left here
that day and did not go back to
her dwelling I was notified by
the Speaker that she had gone
directly to the Chief Elder and
asked to be released

JONAS
But its against the rules

THE GIVER
Its in your rules Jonas But it
wasnt in hers She asked for
release and they had to give it to
her I never saw her again

JONAS
Giver I cant request release I
know that But what if something
happened An accident I know
Im a good swimmer but what if I
wasnt and I fell into the river
A whole years worth of memories
would be released onto the
community And then tI1I- Im
starting to sound like my sister

THE GIVER
You just stay away from the river
The community lost Rosemary after
five weeks and it was a disaster
for them I dont know what the
community would do if they ever
lost you

JONAS
Why was it a disaster

THE GIVER
If you were lost in the river
your memories would not be lost
with you Memories are forever
(MORE)

THE GIVER (contd)
Most of Rosemarys memories were
good ones but there were those
few of suffering They
overwhelmed the community All
those feelings and no point of
reference Theyd never
experienced that before I was so
devastated by my own grief at her
loss that I didnt even try to
help them through it I was
angry too If they ever lost
you they wouldnt know how to
deal with it

JONAS
The only way I deal with it is by
having you there to help me

THE GIVER
I suppose that I could

JONAS
You could what

The Giver is deep in thought

THE GIVER
If you ever floated off in the
river I suppose I could help the
whole community the way Ive
helped you Its an interesting
concept Ill have to think about
it some more But Im glad youre
a good swimmer Jonas

Jonas laughs but its not lighthearted Both his eyes and
the Givers carry their troubled thoughts

INT CLASSROOM - DAY

Jonas Asher Fiona and the rest of their groupmates rise
from their desks and exit the classroom at the sound of the
speaker-boxs TONE

EXT RECREATIONAL AREA - DAY

Jonas and Fiona sit on a bench together some distance away

from the rest of their groupmates They watch the others
enjoy their free period as they converse

FIONA
I can hardly believe we are coming
up on one full year of training

JONAS
I feel the same way It certainly
has been a memorable year

Jonas turns his gaze to Fiona Shes so lovely So unique
and interesting with locks of flaming hair stretching down
her back the perfect frame for her innocent face

FIONA
For me too Ive enjoyed it My
training has been--

JONAS
-- Fiona

She turns to Jonas surprised by his interruption Jonas
almost retreats but then goes for broke and dives in

JONAS

Have you started taking your pill
regularly The one everyone has

to take I mean for the Stirrings
- I-I mean Im sorry for asking I
mean I apologize for being rude
but I ask for my training It has
to do with my Receiver training
Im sorry I probably should have
said that to begin with

Fiona struggles to find her words for a second
FIONA
I-I accept your apology Jonas

JONAS
You dont need to answer I
should probably ask - I mean
um sorry I was just thinking of
something from my training that I
need to know I can ask the
current Receiver probably Hell
let me know

FIONA
Very well

JONAS
Yes

They simply sit there looking out at their groupmates

INT JONAS DWELLING - DINING AREA - NIGHT

The family unit is gathered around the table for their
evening meal Little Gabriel plays merrily on the floor
BABBLING his baby talk

(referring to
Gabriel)
Look at him
MOTHER
Lily finish your meal then look
at him
FATHER

Little guy should enjoy it Its
his last night here

LILY
Why

JONAS
What do you mean Father

FATHER
Well it seemed like a good idea
to have him spend the night in the
Nurturing Center yesterday He
had been sleeping so soundly with
you Jonas But unfortunately
it was a disaster Apparently he
cried the whole night When I got
to work in the morning the night
crew was pretty frazzled

LILY
Gabe you naughty thing
MOTHER
Lily concentrate on your meal
(to Father)
So whats next

FATHER
Well obviously we had to make the
decision Even I voted for
Gabriels release at the meeting
this afternoon We certainly gave
it our best try didnt we

MOTHER
Yes we did A shame

JONAS
(to Father)
When

FATHER

Its scheduled for a few weeks
from now Tomorrow morning we
have the release of one of the
twins so well be busy with that
The upcoming Ceremony will
probably even push it back a
little further

(baby voice)
But then its bye-bye for baby

back

EXT ANNEX - DAY

INT THE GIVERS ROOM - DAY
Jonas enters

JONAS
Hello Giver

THE GIVER
Welcome Jonas We should get
right to work

JONAS
Yes Ive been wasting a lot of
our sessions with questions about
release recently

THE GIVER
Not one moment was a waste
Jonas takes a seat

JONAS
Ive just been curious lately I
suppose Back at my dwelling my
fathers been telling us about the
the twins at the Nurturing Center
(MORE)

74

JONAS (contd)
He had to release one today
Thats probably it

THE GIVER
I wish they wouldnt do that

JONAS
Release one twin Well they
cant have two identical citizens
around Think how confusing it
would be

Jonas takes a seat Then as an afterthought

JONAS
I wish I could watch

THE GIVER
You can watch

JONAS
But they never let children in
Isnt it very private

THE GIVER
Jonas I know you read your
training instructions very
carefully Dont you remember
that youre allowed to ask anyone
anything at any time

JONAS
Of course but--

THE GIVER
-- If you want to watch a release
you have simply to ask

JONAS
Well maybe I will then But
its too late for this one Im
sure it was this morning

THE GIVER
All private ceremonies are
recorded Theyre in the Hall of
Closed Records Do you want to
see this mornings release

Jonas freezes mouth slightly agape

THE GIVER
I think you should

JONAS
All right then

The Giver makes his way across the room to the speaker-box
on the wall He flips the switch up to the ON position

SPEAKER (VO)
Yes Receiver How may I help
you

THE GIVER
I would like to see this mornings
release of the twin

SPEAKER (VO)
One moment Receiver Thank you
for your instructions

The Giver returns to his seat and points Jonas attention to
a video screen on another wall in the room

ON SCREEN

the glass face flashes on with a series of numeric code
Suddenly the screen shows a windowless room empty save for
a bed and an operating table covered with equipment

Jonas father in full Nurturing garb enters the cramped
operating room with a NEWCHILD in his arms A FEMALE
ASSISTANT follows Father in carrying the newchilds TWIN

ON JONAS and THE GIVER

JONAS
Thats my father

The Giver SHUSHES him
ON SCREEN

Father and his assistant lay the naked babies down on the
bed One by one Father picks up the twins and places them
on a scale After he weighs the second one

FATHER
Good I thought for a second they
were going to be the same weight
Then wed really have a problem
But hes six pounds even You can
take him over to the Care Center

The assistant takes the six-pound child out through the door
she entered leaving Father and the other newchild alone
FATHER

(baby voice)
And you little guy youre only
five pounds ten ounces A shrimp

ON JONAS and THE GIVER

THE GIVER
Watch

JONAS
Now he cleans him up and makes him
comfortable He told me

THE GIVER
Jonas be quiet Watch

ON SCREEN

Father reveals a syringe set and a bottle of lucid bubbly
liquid He stabs the needle through the bottles rubber
lid extracting the clear cocktail into the syringe

Father wipes the newchilds forehead with an alcohol prep
and casually STICKS the needle into the spot where the
babys head is pulsing

The child squirms and WAILS FAINTLY

FATHER
I know little guy I know But
the veins in your arms are still
too teeny-weeny All done

Father pushes down the plunger emptying the syringe The
babys extremities jerk in a violent conniption His head
slacks to the side eyes half open He is completely still

ON JONAS and THE GIVER

as both their eyes fill with tears Jonas mouth hangs
open The Giver shakes his head

ON SCREEN

as Father tidies the room He lifts a carton from the floor
and loads the childs corpse into it

He opens a chute on the wall and loads the carton in

The screen goes BLACK Back to JONAS and THE GIVER

THE GIVER

When the Speaker notified me that
Rosemary had been released they
turned on the tape to show me the
process There she was - my last
glimpse at that beautiful child -
waiting They brought in the
syringe and asked her to roll up
her sleeve You suggested Jonas
that perhaps she wasnt brave
enough I dont know much about
bravery I do know that I sat
there numb with horror Wretched
with helplessness I sat there

and listened as Rosemary told them
that she would prefer to inject
herself

The Giver loses control of his emotions Jonas wraps him in
a tight embrace and begins to WEEP HEAVILY

TIME CUT - NIGHT

Jonas and the Giver are slumped lazily in their chairs
completely drained from their mutual outpour of emotion

JONAS
Is it always like that with
release For the Old For people
who break the community rules
three times Do they kill the
Old

THE GIVER
Yes Its always the same

JONAS
What about Fiona She loves the
Old Does she know yet

THE GIVER
Your friend is already being
trained in the fine art of
release Feelings are not part of
the life shes learned

JONAS
What should I do I cant go
back

The Giver rises from his seat

THE GIVER
First I will order our evening
meal Then we will eat

Jonas pipes up with bitter sarcasm

JONAS
Then well have a sharing of
feelings

The Giver lets out an empty belt of laughter He walks over
and rubs Jonas hunched shoulders

THE GIVER
Jonas you and I are the only ones
who have feelings Weve been
sharing them now for almost a
year

JONAS
Im sorry Giver I dont mean to
be so hateful Not to you

The Giver walks toward the speaker-box on the wall

JONAS (contd)
And after we eat well make a
plan

The Giver stops short of the speaker-box turns to Jonas

THE GIVER
A plan for what

Jonas answers his mentor with a simple look one of
determination self-assurance destiny

THE GIVER
Very well

EXT AREA OF DWELLINGS - DAY
Jonas rides his bike up to his dwelling

THE GIVER (0OS)
The community has depended all
these generations back and back
and back on a resident Receiver
to hold their memories for them
The good the bad the unspeakably
horrific and the unbelievably
beautiful all of them Ive
turned over many of them to you

(MORE)

THE GIVER (contd)
and I cannot take back what I have
given So if you escape once
you are gone Jonas you know that
you can never return

Jonas ports his bicycle and walks into his dwelling

JONAS (0S)
Yes

THE GIVER (0OS)
If you get away if you get
beyond if you get Elsewhere it
will mean that the community has
to bear the burden themselves of
the memories you had been holding
for them A full years worth of
agony and ecstacy
INT JONAS DWELLING - DINING AREA - DAY

Jonas and his family unit quietly eat their standard morning
meals at the table

JONAS (0S)
Ill leave at midnight the
morning of the annual Ceremonies
Ill be careful No one will see
me

THE GIVER (0OS)
As Receiver-in-training youre
held in very high respect already
So I think you wouldnt be
questioned very forcefully
Theres no nighttime attendant
here at the Annex Ill leave the
door unlocked You simply slip
into the room Ill be waiting
for you

INT CLASSROOM - DAY

Jonas and his groupmates listen to the ramblings of their
Instructor in the middle of a lesson

THE GIVER (0OS)
Leave your parents a note telling
them that you decided to go on a
morning ride along the river
Write that youll be back in time
(MORE)

THE GIVER (contd)
for the Ceremony Theyll be
irritated but not alarmed

JONAS (0S)
They wont mention anything to
anyone because it would reflect
on their parenting And anyway
everyone is so involved in the
Ceremonies that they probably
wont notice that Im not there

INT THE GIVERS ROOM - DAY
Jonas and the Giver sit across from each other

THE GIVER
Ill save and package portions
from all of my meals in the few
weeks we still have until the
Ceremony Ill give them all to
you when you arrive

JONAS
Be sure to save plenty
The Giver

because Im taking Gabriel with
me I wish you would come too

regretfully shakes his head

JONAS
I understand theyll need you

THE GIVER
My work will be finished when I
have helped the community to
change and become a whole

JONAS
But dont you want to be with me
Giver

THE GIVER
Jonas I love you But my role is
to stay Youre forgetting my
age I would never make it Im
drained Did you know that I no
longer see color

Jonas eyes almost burst with tears

THE GIVER
We dont know what lies beyond our
community and the bordering
communities we associate with
Jonas There may be nothing at
all or there may be serious
danger or there may be everything
youre looking for

JONAS
There may be love There may be
freedom I wont find any of that
here

THE GIVER
Well then You have the
colors now And the strength
Ill transfer my remaining
memories of warmth to you Also
its about time I transferred
something else to you I think
Ive been a bit selfish I wanted
to hold it for myself as long as I
could but you need to understand
everything before you go

JONAS
What is it

THE GIVER
When I was a boy younger than
you it wasnt the seeing beyond
that came to me It was

different For me it was
hearing-beyond

JONAS
What did you hear

THE GIVER
Music I began to hear something
truly remarkable and its called
music Ill give you some before
you go

JONAS
No Giver I want you to keep
that to have with you when Im
gone

The Giver smiles gently

JONAS
Are you sure youre not coming
with me

A genuine laugh escapes The Giver

THE GIVER
Oh no No I have another place
to go When my work is done here
I want to finally be with my
daughter

JONAS
Giver You told me you had a
spouse but you have never
mentioned a daughter

The Giver smiles wide and nods For the very first time he
looks TRULY HAPPY

THE GIVER
Yes Her name was Rosemary

overabundance of buttons switches and other advanced
technological tools One of the gadgets is labeled as a
heat-seeking view screen

UNKNOWN TERRITORY - BUSHES

Jonas frantically places his hands against Gabes back
closes his eyes and transfers a memory

COCKPIT

The view screen is only picking up cool blobs of gray in the
area

UNKNOWN TERRITORY - BUSHES

Jonas and Gabe are shivering in the bush as the sound of
the airplanes engine fades away

EXT UNTAMED TERRAIN - DAY

The paved roads disappear and Jonas rides down the
narrowing path over stones and ruts

The bikes front tire catches a large rock and CRASHES into
the dirt Gabe is fine but Jonas winces in pain as the
result of a scraped knee

EXT RUNNING STREAM - DAY

Gabriel helps Jonas rinse off his bloody knee in the water

UNTAMED TERRAIN

Jonas braves on pushing the pedals non-stop Suddenly
Gabe points his chubby arm to the sky

GABRIEL
Pane Pane

Thats how he says plane Jonas veers them off the
pathway and under the nearest assemblage of vegetation

Hearing no roaring engine Jonas pokes his head out from the
trees and sees nothing more than your average jaybird
soaring through the sky

GABRIEL
Its a pane

Jonas smiles
TIME CUT - NIGHT
They ride all night worn and dirtied every second taking
them farther and farther away

EXT UNTAMED TERRAIN - DAY
Jonas and Gabe have stopped in the middle of nowhere to
stare at a pair of deer nosing around some bushes Gabriel
points at the animals excitedly

GABRIEL

Oohhh Oohhh

EXT POND - DAY
Jonas and Gabriel sit by the muddy water and eat the last of
the food from their satchel

EXT UNTAMED TERRAIN - NIGHT

Jonas pedals through the night as it rains down heavily
soaking everything in sight

EXT RUNNING STREAM - DAY

Jonas kneels by the stream and randomly jabs his fists into
the water trying to catch a fish

TIME CUT
Jonas weaves the the strands of Gabes blanket around a
curved stick

TIME CUT

Jonas swoops his makeshift net into the stream again and
again After countless tries he comes up with a single
flapping silvery fish

INT PATCH OF SHRUBBERY - NIGHT

Jonas pounds the dead fish with a rock He and Gabriel
share the raw shreds

Jonas and Gabriel ride on looking very weary with their
clothes torn and faces dirtied

INT SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY

A group of SEVENS stand in the line waiting to receive
their midday meals One of them is SEVEN-YEAR-OLD JONAS
is standing in front of SEVEN-YEAR-OLD ASHER

JONAS
(to Asher)
Im starving

An INSTRUCTOR standing nearby overhears this

INSTRUCTOR
Jonas

The Instructor stomps over and pulls Jonas out of line
leading him away from the other children

He

INSTRUCTOR
Jonas you must learn to use more
precise language You are not
starving that is a gross
exaggeration You simply have
some feelings of hunger because
it is time for the midday meal

JONAS
I apologize for not speaking
precisely Instructor

INSTRUCTOR
I accept your apology Jonas As
long as you are a part of this

community you will never be
starving

BACK TO THE GRASSY AREA

Jonas pulls Gabriels sleeping body closer to his own and
begins to WEEP softly

EXT SOMEWHERE COLD - NIGHT

Jonas and Gabe slowly pedal down the endless ribbon of path
in front of them They appear weak and drained as
miserable as can be Jonas rounds the the narrow curves in
the road with less urgency than before

A soft swirling downfall of white begins to descend upon
them Theyre shivering

As the snowfall thickens they ride up to the base of a tall
hill blanketed in frosty white precipitation

Jonas pulls Gabe from the child seat and drops the bike He
wraps the childs torn and dirtied blanket around the both
of them again securing Gabriel in place against his chest

He whispers

JONAS
Its called snow Gabe Theyre
called snowflakes Theyre
beautiful

Jonas begins scaling the snowy hill He has to force his
tired legs with every step As he presses on Jonas places
his hands against Gabes back and concentrates

EXT BEACH - DAY

The sun beats down radiantly but only for a second and then
they are transported

BACK TO SOMEWHERE COLD

Back to the snowy hill Jonas continues trudging up the
hill until he trips over a mound of snow and falls He
slowly regains his footing then places his hands on
Gabriels back once more

BACK TO THE BEACH

The sun shines brilliantly but even quicker than it
happened before it is

BACK TO SOMEWHERE COLD

Back to the snowy hill Jonas looks down at Gabe in his
arms The newchilds usually rosy cheeks have been tinted
blue with dried tear stains outlined in dirt He is ina
DEEP SLEEP

Jonas fights on dragging his heavy feet up the hill until
he reaches the summit Jonas stops walking finally on
level ground The snow swirls in the air He smiles

JONAS
Were almost there Gabe I
remember this place

Jonas walks to the opposite edge of the hill and sits down
on the RED SLED He holds Gabriel tight and brushes away
the powdery snow beneath him until his hands find the rope

Jonas blows his breath into the air and watches it drift
away with the snowflakes He sits intoxicated by the
surreal beauty of the scene before him as he stares off
into space

Finally he leans his body forward and they start down on
the sled slicing through the ice with ease Down and down
faster and faster

JONAS POV -
through the whipping wind and thick swirling snow Its
difficult to see but there are LIGHTS dancing along the

horizon

A faint echo of MUSIC flutters and then BUILDS PEOPLE
SINGING The harmonious MELODY plays like a lullaby

Jonas smiles in ecstasy with sleeping Gabriel clamped
tightly to his torso The sled picks up speed as it zips
down the final diagonal stretch of the snowy hill

The music The colors The snow Down down down
faster faster faster

CUT TO BLACK

THE END
