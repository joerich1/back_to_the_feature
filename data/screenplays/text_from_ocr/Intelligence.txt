EXT OCEAN - NIGHT 1

Middle of the ocean Water calm not a boat in sight Except
a junky old MOTOR YACHT

EXT MOTOR YACHT - SAME 2

The man on the bridge piloting the yacht is GABRIEL BLACK
35 athletic handsome sharp eyes and a capable demeanor He
cuts the engines and a plume of black diesel smoke envelopes
him for a moment and then disappears in the wind

He climbs down the ladder and walks easily along the narrow
gunnel on the side of the boat to the broad bow deck He
stands in the center the boat bobbing gently on the soft
waves and STARES UP AT THE STARS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING

After a moment his HEAD TILTS QUICKLY AND SHARPLY as if
struck by something Then he stares straight ahead almost
trance-like and WE SMASHCUT TO

visual example of what we’re imagining please CLICK HERE

CAMERA continues to glide past these STILL IMAGES until A
quick glance at a MIRROR and WE SEE MOVEMENT Its Gabriel
the only figure moving through the eerie and surreal scene

Hes searching for something - someone As he walks
something else begins to happen The walls deconstruct and in
their place we see a DATA STREAM - PHOTOS NEWSPAPER

Gabriel standing on the bow of the boat

GABRIEL’S POV - the 3D ENVIRONMENT of the TAJ MAHAL HOTEL
LOBBY surrounds him semi-translucent He’s somehow creating
a virtual space out here in the middle of the ocean

Beyond the virtual images Gabriel also spots an approaching
VESSEL on the horizon

GABRIEL
Not yet I haven’t found her

INT LOBBY TAJ MAHAL HOTEL MUMBAI - DAY(CYBER-RENDERING) 5

Gabriel continues to move through the macabre scene and spots
the woman hes looking for

GABRIEL
No Amelia no

He approaches the frozen figure of AMELIA HAYTES a striking
beautiful Caucasian woman 30 blue backpack slung over one
shoulder an AUTOMATIC RIFLE in her hands angrily pointing

it at a group of HOSTAGES Standing next to her is another
GUNMAN the FLAME from his gun barrel suspended in mid-burst
As Gabriel approaches them WE SEE a rapid DATA STREAM in
Gabriels POV - THE MANS NAME COUNTRY OF ORIGIN - PAKISTAN -
AND HIS INTERNATIONAL RAP SHEET Gabriel turns back to Amelia
and a similar DATA STREAM flashes various images a CIA ID
and her name

GABRIEL (CONTD)
How could you

WE HEAR a LOUD VOICE of someone speaking over a PA IN HINDI

INT INTERROGATION ROOM INDIAN COAST GUARD CUTTER - NIGHT 7

Gabriel is being questioned by an Indian Intelligence Officer
named BADRI ADANI

BADRI ADANT
You are in Indian waters ona
rented boat with no papers no
passport

Gabriel doesn’t respond

BADRI ADANI (CONT’D)
What were you doing twenty miles
off shore all by yourself

Gabriel glances up at the CAMERA pointed at him from above
Switch to CAMERA POV of Gabriel staring at us

Outside the door a similar CAMERA is aimed down the
corridor

COFFEE She types in a series of numbers on the ELECTRIC DOOR
LOCK

INT INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME 9

Gabriel looks at the door as the final ELECTRONIC BEEP of the
door combination signals the CLICK of the door opening The
female officer enters and hands Adani his coffee

FEMALE OFFICER
(Hindi subtitled)
We’re pulling into port now

Adani smiles at her which Gabriel notices and she leaves
Adani takes a sip of his coffee and continues

BADRI ADANT
At eighteen hundred hours we were
alerted to a Level One sigint
breach on a highly protected
military geosync satellite We
sourced the signal to your vessel
yet we didn’t find any
communication equipment on board
let alone with the processing power
to break through a Helio-encrypted
fire wall Can you explain that
INTELLIGENCESeitzmanNetwork Draft 4012813 4

GABRIEL
You know she doesn’t like the
attention you give her

BADRI ADANT
What are you talking about

GABRIEL
That officer Abhilasha She’s
married and you make her
uncomfortable

BADRI ADANT
How do you know her name

GABRIEL
In fact she’s afraid of you Why
is that Badri

BADRI ADANT
I haven’t told you my first name

Gabriel looks at the door and the LOCK STARTS DIALING Adani
follows Gabriel’s gaze to the door as it CLICKS but doesn’t
open He walks to the door and opens it finding no one
outside He suddenly realizes something

BADRI ADANI (CONT’D)
Did you just do that

He turns back to Gabriel but the CHAIR IS EMPTY -- SLAM
Adani crashes against the wall and the last thing he sees are
Gabriel’s feet running up the corridor

INT CORRIDOR INDIAN COAST GUARD CUTTER - SAME 12

Alarms blare as Gabriel runs down another corridor He
reaches a ladder and CLIMBS IT QUICKLY just as AN INDIAN
SAILOR come running toward him He turns behind him and TWO
MORE are coming from that direction He runs toward the
single sailor The sailor STRIKES but Gabriel parries the
blow his other fist snapping like gun hammer into the man’s
throat The sailor staggers backward gasping as Gabriel
heads toward a ladder

EXT DECK INDIAN COAST GUARD CUTTER - CONTINUOUS 13

The docks of the port pass by on either side as Gabriel
emerges onto the deck and RUNS SAILORS SHOUT behind him One
appears in his path with an AUTOMATIC RIFLE Gabriel drops
behind a turret a barrage of bullets flying past him and
ricocheting off the steel of the vessel

The gun continues firing from over Gabriel’s shoulder while
twenty sailors come at him from two other directions Among
them is a bleeding and angry Adani pistol in hand

Gabriel doesn’t hesitate running in the only direction
available to him - the edge of the deck and the water below

Bullets swarm as he dives and splashes into the water of the
harbour Adani and the other officers run to the edge of the
boat and look down into the murky darkness and see NOTHING

EXT FARM ROAD - DAY 14

A cow lazily lumbers along the side of the road chewing the
tall grass as a black SUV zooms by

EXT PASTURE - DAY 15

The black SUV leaves a dust trail behind it as it snakes up
higher and higher up the hillside It finally barrels up over
the rise giving us a VIEW of

A HEAVILY FORTIFIED COMPLEX in the middle of Virginia farm
country The compound is comprised of a dozen buildings a
large array of radar dishes spread out across a green
pasture all surrounded by MILITARY VEHICLES and SOLDIERS

RILEY
Yes Sergeant

Before she can say anything else he steps away and signals

to someone to raise the gate The gate in front of the SUV

swings up and the driver pulls slowly through On each side

of the gate are SOLDIERS M-16s slung over their shoulders

INT LOBBY US CYBER COMMAND - DAY

The sounds of Riley’s footsteps and that of her driver echo
down the empty hallway approaching another guard desk The

double doors behind the desk open and a woman steps out
She’s LILLIAN STRAND 50 Lillian has strong attractive
features piercing eyes conservative suit and an all-

business demeanor

RILEY
Pleasure to finally meet you Ms
Strand I’ve heard a lot ab

LILLIAN

The driver stays behind as Riley follows Lillian back

through the double doors and into

INT CYBERCOM LABORATORIES - CONTINUOUS

It’s a sprawling collection of LAB STATIONS populated by

hundreds of MEN and WOMEN in WHITE COATS

INTELLIGENCESeitzmanNetwork Draft 4012813 7

They pass a section where a woman wearing an EXOSKELETON runs
on a treadmill at 40mph as TECHNICIANS monitor her

LILLIAN
I understand you have questions

RILEY
I was ordered to go through months
of testing and vetting and nobody
will even tell me what the job is

LILLIAN
That’s because the position itself
is Classified Code Word

Riley expects Lillian to tell her about the job but Lillian
just keeps walking They pass a lab station where a man with
EEG sensors on his head sits quietly reading the newspaper
As he does the WORDS of the article he’s reading APPEAR ONE
BY ONE ON THE MONITOR on the wall

RILEY
What’s he doing

LILLIAN
Word Mapping Ever word has a
corresponding brain signal We’re
translating them in real time

RILEY
Is that even possible

LILLIAN
What do you know about CyberCom

RILEY
I know you’re responsible for cyber
security for the government

LILLIAN
CyberCom’s purview includes the
development of genetics robotics
artificial intelligence and
nanotechnology as well as data
mining DeepNet salvage
cryptanlysis and protection of the
Global Information Grid And then
there’s Clockwork

RILEY
Clockwork

Two ARMED SOLDIERS open a set of double doors for them

Two more ARMED GUARDS open the doors

INT HALLWAY CLOCKWORK LABORATORY - SAME 20

They enter a walkway surrounding the glass walls of a round
room - THE LAB A few TECHNICIANS work on equipment
surrounding an examination table on which lies a MAN the
top of his head facing us so we can’t see him just yet

LILLIAN
Once we started translating the
brain’s signals - phase syncrony
neural integration proteomics - we
realized we could facilitate a

direct neural

interface that could

access the entire electromagnetic
spectrum - telephone internet
radio satellite

RILEY
Are you saying you put a computer
in a man’s brain

LILLIAN

I’m saying we

created a man who is

the first of his kind An advanced
intelligence agent

Now we see the man on the table It’s Gabriel His eyes are
closed as a TECHNICIAN works a computer next to him

LILLIAN (CONTD)

We built an agency complex around
him - analysts tack teams field
ops When a situation rises to a

certain level

of national security

Intelligence brings us in

INTELLIGENCESeitzmanNetwork Draft 4012813

LILLIAN (CONTD)
Gabriel’s been active for six
months and since then we’ve
enjoyed an 85 success rate
Included in that success is the
thwarting of the Super Bowl bomber

RILEY
I thought that was CIA

LILLIAN
You haven’t been cleared to think
anything different

Lillian opens the door and leads Riley into

21 INT CLOCKWORK LAB - CONTINUOUS
Lillian and Riley enter

RILEY
What are they doing to him

The technician AMOS PEMBROKE looks up Lillian
that he can answer

AMOS
Stuxnet Two eradication

RILEY
Stuxnet The computer virus

He looks at Lillian She nods again

AMOS

Virus Please Stuxnet is the
world’s first weaponized cyber
worm a digital cruise missile We
took out Iran’s nuke program first
and now North Korea Boo-yah

(beat)
Of course the only way to plant it
in an isolated bunkerized system
four stories underground was for
Gabriel to carry it himself

(points to Gabriel’s head)
Which is why we’re making sure none
of the code burrowed in

RILEY
Is he under anaesthesia

nods

GABRIEL
He wishes
(opens his eyes)
Riley You’ve changed your hair
color

RILEY
I’m sorry have we met

Now we see Riley from GABRIELS POV A facial recognition
program draws lines around her face measuring distance
between eyes etc as DATA STREAMS including flashes of
TEXT and PHOTOS - are on each side of the screen

GABRIEL
No but wow

RILEY
What does that mean

GABRIEL
That nude photo you sent to your
boyfriend in college And they’re
yours Nice

RILEY
Excuse me

Riley looks at Lillian who isn’t amused

GABRIEL
Gotta be careful when you send
pictures out there It’s called
Digital Permanence right Amos

AMOS
Don’t worry he can’t print
By the way I’m Amos Pembroke

GABRIEL
Ten-sixty on your SATs

RILEY
I was a bad test taker Who the
hell do you think you are

GABRIEL
Whoa I just found a sealed
juvenile record

LILLIAN
Gabriel don’t open that file

GABRIEL
What’s in it Shoplifting
(hands up in surrender)
Fine But tell me how does the
daughter of a surgeon and a chemist
become a Secret Service Agent

In GABRIELS POV we FLASH to various images in rapid fire
FAMILY PHOTOS NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS FACEBOOK PAGES Finally
a quick shot of President OBAMA getting into a limo RILEY
CLOSING THE LIMO DOOR an earpiece in her ear

GABRIEL (CONTD)
Youngest woman ever assigned to
presidential detail That’s the
beginning of a storied career And
now what Follow around a charming
devil with a chip in his brain

RILEY
Impressive Almost every word of
that was accurate

GABRIEL
Almost Which word did I get wrong

RILEY
Charming

Amos stifles a laugh Gabriel shoots him a look Lillian is
suddenly very satisfied with her choice in Riley

RILEY (CONTD)

to Lillian gestures to the guards to stand down One of them
types a code into a wall keypad the alarm stops The doors
close again leaving Riley and Lillian in the empty hallway

every discipline Of the top
twenty you’re the only one we
brought here

LILLIAN
What did you think was going to
happen after India That’s the
third time you went off-book and
almost burned Clockwork to a
foreign government And all for
intel you already have

GABRIEL
The Indian DIA files make no
mention of Amelia’s death

LILLIAN
But they did identify her as one of
the attackers

GABRIEL
That doesn’t mean she turned CIA
had her deep black for two years
For all we know she was still
dark

LILLIAN
Maybe maybe not But thirty-three
bodies incinerated in the fire in
Mumbai and she never reported in
or showed up on the grid again

GABRIEL
And that’s evidence

no snow on the ground and in the

bang and burn your own agency in
pursuit of this fairy tale you’re
clinging to Whatever became of

Nothing

AMOS
See And no audio

GONZO
What about the van’s plates

AMOS
Were trying to dig out a partial

JAMESON
Did they get his computer

LILLIAN
FBI swept No computers found

AMOS
His computer isn’t a concern I
created the encryption protocol
Twenty-forty Bit Impregnable

GABRIEL
Unless they torture him for his
password

Everyone turns to Gabriel He’s right of course

JAMESON

Do we know what’s on that computer
LILLIAN

No
JAMESON

If they get in they could learn
about Gabriel

GONZO
He could be a target already

GABRIEL
Then it’s good we have Riley to
protect me

Everyone turns to see the woman he’s referring to Riley

continue walking across CDOC and down a long hallway

RILEY
Ms Strand I hope you find Dr
Crispin but I put in a call to

LILLIAN
Your ASAC Yes I know

RILEY
I’m sorry I’m not a bodyguard
When the President has an event
I’ve already done ninety percent of
my work I can walk through a hotel
lobby blindfolded and know how many
steps it is to every exit I have
hundreds of support assets
ambulances a helicopter on the
pad and two F-22s standing by We
don’t make PTZ stops unless it’s
absolutely necessary You want me
to ride with a belligerent
protectee with no assets and
everywhere we go is a potential
threat zone I can’t do that

LILLIAN
That’s not your problem Your
problem is that you think
protecting the president is more
important than this

RILEY
Because respectfully it is more
important than this

With that everyone is on their feet Riley though follows
Lillian out the door

INTELLIGENCESeitzmanNetwork Draft 4012813

LILLIAN
We got very lucky with Gabriel
When we were looking for a
candidate the criteria wasn’t just
to find someone capable We needed
to thread a very rare genetic
needle Let me tell you something
about him When he was a Seal he
was alternately shot cut up
tortured burned and frozen alive
None of it stopped him He
volunteered for five tours in Iraq
and Afghanistan Five That’s a
hero in there

RI

I’m sure he is

LI
We’re in the

LEY
But

LLIAN
middle of a

technological arms race unlike
anything we’ve seen since the
Soviet nukes Now if you knew that
every nation on earth was trying to
steal our nuclear arsenal would
that be important to you

RILEY

Yes obviously but
LILLIAN

What do you know about Echelon

RILEY
It’s a system that develops threat
assessments by monitoring
electronic communication

Lillian stops and turns to her

LILLIAN

Echelon is a hunter Echelon can
find its prey in a jungle so dense
that sunlight can’t breach the
canopy Echelon is the most
fearsome weapon in human history

(off her look)
Riley Gabriel is Echelon And
protecting him is the most
important thing you’1ll ever do

Was it drugs
She looks at him then back at the road She’s not playing

GABRIEL (CONTD)
Did you hold up a liquor store
(still no answer)
Come on I thought this was the
part where we share and bond

RILEY
Seems more like the part where I
find out how much of a pain in the
ass you are

Gabriel’s HEAD TILTS sharply -- something is happening
RILEY

What’s happening Are you okay
Should I pull over

Gabriel Riley and Amos sit with NELSON CRISPIN 35 years
old next to a large window overlooking the Potomac River

NELSON

What was in the safe Dad’s
computer We drilled a hole in the

back for the wires

GABRIEL

What was on the computer that

warranted that

NELSON

Nothing compromising Dad was just
paranoid about his memoirs He’s
been dictating them for months

(MORE )

INTELLIGENCESeitzmanNetwork Draft 4012813 23

NELSON (CONTD)
He said it’s easier to talk to
Albert so I made him a recorder

Nelson takes a deep breath tries to collect himself

NELSON (CONT’D)
He is going to be really happy to
see you again Gabriel Talks about
you all the time

That nearly puts Nelson over the edge Riley looks at Amos
her eyes telling him to say something

AMOS
You built the recorder

NELSON
Yeah I wanted it to respond to his
voice Wasn’t hard I used the
Corona chassis added a few gigs of
flash and hacked some code to make
it dump into the computer every
night

AMOS
That’s why it was sending out the
signal that Gabriel picked up It
was trying to log in

GABRIEL
Nelson is there anything in those

Just three weeks ago you sent an

from the center A shiny MONOLITH floats into the frame The
monolith is held by tweezers and we suddenly realize the
monolith is a MICROCHIP and the maze is the FINGERPRINT on
the end of a finger The CHIP is placed on the FINGER

The finger belongs to JIN CONG a handsome Chinese man in a
dark suit He stares at the chip holding it up to the light
He turns to Dr Crispin framed by two ARMED CHINESE MEN

CONG
What would your government do to
you if they learned you not only
made another chip but you made it
even better than the first

CRISPIN
It probably doesn’t even work

CONG
How long after the surgery will you
know if it’s been a success

Your surgical team has just landed

spared no expense in outfitting
this room with everything you will
need

CRISPIN
Everything Ill need for what This
isn’t some appendectomy Getting
past the histocompatibility complex
was a feat in and of itself but to
coax the brain’s chemical
neurotransmitters into generating a
completely new biochemical language
was tantamount to creating a sixth
sense We rewrote the rules of
nature I implore you to explain to
your government

CONG

My government Beijing is too
crippled by so-called reformers to
do anything this bold No doctor
I’m not doing this on behalf of my
government I intend to take back
my government from the cowards who
denigrate it

CRISPIN
The fact remains that this simply
won’t work We discovered that the
candidate must possess a very rare
genetic mutation called Athens-
4U7R To find such a person

CONG
This is Mei Zhao She possesses the
gene mutation Athens-4U7R

Crispin is stunned Cong is satisfied

Cong nods to one of his men who opens a door revealing a
beautiful 26-year-old Chinese woman named MEI ZHAO

NELSON
And what about me I’m not seventy
Do you even know what my
contribution was to this program

LILLIAN
The thing I can’t figure out
Nelson is why you sold out your
country Was it because I insulted
your father by letting him go Or
was it because I insulted you by
not inviting you for tea
