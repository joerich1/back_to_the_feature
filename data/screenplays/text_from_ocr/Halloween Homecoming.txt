HALLOWEEN THE HOMECOMING

WRITTEN BY LARRY BRAND AND SEAN HOOD

MAIN TITLES
FADE IN
INT SANITARIUM HALLWAY

We are at the end of the hallway and move closer to a door at the end with a
circular window in the middle of the door

LAURIE (VO)
Thereâ€™s a tunnel we all have to go down one
time in our lives At the end is a door which
leads to either heaven or hell This is that
door

We move through the window to find Laurie Strode holding a
Raggedy Ann doll

FLASH TO

THE EMS VAN
CRASHING down the hill and PINNING the man against the tree --

FLASH TO

THE FIRE AX
in Lauries hands SWINGING in one unmerciful arc --

FLASH TO

INT THE HILLCREST ACADEMY - NIGHT

Michael Myers is lying on the floor We hear SIRENS in the distancethe
sound of the door OPENINGFOOTSTEPS

TWO POLICE OFFICERS

are the first on the scene They enter cautiously moving slowly with guns
drawn They notice the body lying nearby
OFFICER
See if hes still breathing Ill secure the
floor

The other cop steps over looks at the body the blood

OFFICER 2
No way man This guy is chum

He turns back to his partner whos disappeared further inside
And Michael Myers RISES to a sit behind hin

as Michael GRABS the cop from behind bringing him down quickly wrapping
one big hand around the mans throat and CRUSHING his larynx -- He quickly
starts removing the unconscious mans police uniform The first cop returns
to the room just in time to see a SHAPE slipping out through a side door It
is wearing a police uniform It moves out into the night and is gone

FLASH TO

THE SEVERED HEAD

lying on the ground as a hand reaches to pull off the white maskand we
see the face of the police officer revealed

FADE TO BLACK

We hear a slow rhythmic CLACK-CLACK-CLACK hard and insistent as the beat of
a petrified heart And SUDDENLY FLUORESCENT LIGHT invades our space harsh
and ugly and we find ourselves in a featureless white CORRIDOR that seems to
stretch to infinity Soft and muffled as if coming from some hidden
dimension we hear crazed laughter pathetic whimpering wild canine yelping
the sounds of madness emanating from the wallsthen FOOTSTEPS

INT SANITARIUM - NIGHT

Two nurses walk down the hall pushing a medicine cart their uniforms as
hard white as the fluorescence The first voice belongs to HEAD NURSE
WELLES the other to NURSE PHILLIPS a young newcomer to the facility The
CLACKING sound everpresent grows LOUDER

NURSE WELLES
Youve never heard of Laurie Strode

The novice shakes her head
NURSE WELLES
The Halloween murders The brother of Michael

Myers

NURSE PHILLIPS
Ijust moved here from Wisconsin

NURSE WELLES
She decapitated a man

NURSE PHILLIPS
My God Decapitated Whyd she do it

NURSE WELLES
I dont know does insanity run in
families Are people born evil or can they
be made that way

NURSE PHILLIPS
Um we didnt really study that in --

NURSE WELLES
I guess those are philosophical questions

not psychiatric ones right

They stop at the door A small circle of reinforced glass looks into the
room

POV INSIDE ROOM

where we see the perfectly-arranged items as if some attempt has been made
to find order in a random universe It resembles a teenage girls room
circa late seventies a haven for someone surrounding herself with the
artifacts of a gentler past

We hear the CLACK-CLACK-CLACKand move SLOWLY to FIND

LAURIE STRODE

sitting by her window staring outside She is crying In her bed sits a
Raggedy Ann doll dressed in a robe like the one Laurie is wearing

BACK TO
LAURIE SITTING
in her chair rocking gently Eyes open but unseeing
LAURIES EYES
as they become giant mirrors of a haunted soul
FLASH TO

INT EMS TRUCK - NIGHT
As Laurie drives the commandeered vehicle as the man in the white mask fights
his way out of the body bag behind her --

FLASH TO

LAURIE SLAMMING
the BRAKES as the body is PROPELLED through the windshield --
THROUGH LAURIES EYES

and OUT THE WINDOW of the SANITARIUM and INTO THE WOODS surrounding the
facility -- where we get just the faintest glimpse of a dark shape white
face moving moving --

Then we hear the door OPENING and the two nurses entering They move around
in front of us wheeling the medicine cart alongside the chair We notice
the different bottles of medicine several hypodermic syringes

WIDER ANGLE

as Nurse Welles gently places a pill on Lauries tongue then washes it down
with a paper cup of water She straightens

But SUDDENLY Lauries body starts to CONVULSE violently KNOCKING over the
medicine tray Her chair TOPPLES to the floor beside the spilled medicine
bottles and syringes

The two nurses struggle to get her calm again finally righting the
chair Laurie seems over it Nurse Phillips bends to gather up the

medications

NURSE PHILLIPS
Jesus Has she ever done that before

NURSE WELLES
Not on my watch Ill talk to Dr Howard in
the morning about upping her meds
And Laurie watches through her vacant eyes as the two nurses leave the room
locking the door behind them She stares outside her window to see MICHAEL
MYERS LOOKING BACK AT HER

The figure moves into the half-light and we see its one of the patients
walking with the stiff movements of neurological disorder Hes wearing a
bright red-and-white clown mask

FRANKLIN

Franklin takes the mans arm and walks him down the hall

FRANKLIN

BEHIND THE CONTROL PANEL

Sara finds the main input cable and pulls it from its socket

MICHAEL SPINS

toward the control panel as he hears her

SARA DUCKS

back down behind the control panel with the cable She peers back through
the mass of wires and connectors as the shape moves toward her homing in on
his target like a shark

She looks around frantically noticing

INSERT

Noraâ€™s giant cup of Mochaccino at the edge of the panel

SHE REACHES

one hand quietly up to grab the cup then ducks back down as

MICHAEL MOVES

among the cables and hardware knife glinting in his hand

ANGLE ON SARA
as she quietly spills the coffee in a puddle on the floor then tries to hide
back behind the control panel as suddenly

MICHAEL APPEARS

above her and his knife SLASHES viciously down toward her but his arm gets
CAUGHT in the web of connecting cables

WIDER ANGLE

as Sara tries to slip by him in the narrow space as Michael THRASHES about in
the cables getting entangled SPARKS flying as his blade SLASHES through
wires and connectors

Sara pokes at him with the prongs of the electrical wire catching him in the
torso and causing his body to spasm even more violently as the knife SWINGS
down at her missing her by inches

Finally Michael frees himself and comes after her

Sara breaks for the door dropping the cable into the pool of coffee -- as
Michael LUNGES at herthen STIFFENS as we hear a CRACKLE She turns back
to the SIZZLING and SPUTTERING

Michael stands stiffly in the pool of blood his back arching ramrod straight
as the voltage courses through his body SMOKE pours from the mask eyeholes
until it starts melting merging with his face

Sara watches in horror and relief as finally Michael slumps as the
electricity shorts out in an explosion of sparks his body held up by the
cables in an eerie tableau arms spread cruciform like a dark messiah of the
new millennium
