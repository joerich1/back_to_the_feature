The following sequence is almost a home-movie The images are grainy
and seem bleached by sunlight like an impressionist painting They are
scored to the narrators voice and describe JESSES eccentricities and
the circumstances of his daily life There is no natural sound just
music that tugs at our sense of melancholy Jesse is presented to us
initially as a shadow or with his back turned as we approach this

legendary figure gradually
EXT WOODLAND AVE COTTAGE - DUSK

NARRATOR (V0)
He was growing into middle age and was living
then in a bungalow on Woodland Avenue

Green weeds split the porch steps a wasp nest clings to an attic
gable a rope swing loops down from a dying elm tree and the ground
below it is scuffed soft as flour

NARRATOR (V0)
He installed himself ina rocking chair and
smoked a cigar down in the evening as his
wife wiped her pink hands on an apron and
reported happily on their two children

INT WOODLAND AVE COTTAGE - DAY

Whenever he walked about the house he
carried several newspapers the Sedalia
Daily democrat the St Joseph Gazette and
the Kansas City Times - each with a foot-long
44 caliber pistol tucked into a fold

EXT STREET KANSAS CITY - DAY

JESSE from a distance a dandy in his gentleman‘s clothes and cane
Everyone seems to know him

the common touch

He had two incompletely healed bullet holes
in his chest and another in his thigh He was

missing the nub of his left middle finger and
was cautious lest that mutilation be seen

EXT WOODLAND AVE BACKYARD - DUSK
JESSE looks out beyond the prairie wheat to the dying sun

NARRATOR (VO)
He also had a condition that was referred to
as granulated eyelids and it caused him to
blink more than usual as if he found
creation slightly more than he could accept

EXT GARDEN PATCH - DAY

He scours for nightcrawlers and flips them into manure pails He chops
them into writhing sections and sprinkles them over his garden patch

NARRATOR (V0O)
He could neither multiply nor divide without
error and much of his science was
superstition He could list the many begotten
of Abraham and the sixty-six books of the
king James Bible he could recite psalms and
poems in a stentorian voice with suitable
histrionics he could sing religious hymns so
convincingly that he once worked as a
choirmaster he was marvelously informed
about current events

MONTAGE JESSES beliefs

NARRATOR (VO)
And yet he thought incense was made from the
bones of saints

Bones are ground

NARRATOR (VO)
-that leather continued to grow if not dyed

Leather grows

NARRATOR (V0O)
-that if he concentrated hard enough his
body’s electrical currents could stun lake

ON JESSE as he slowly lifts a flaming hand

NARRATOR (V0)
His enemies would not have been much
surprised if he produced horned owls from
beer bottles or made candles out of his

fingers
EXT WOODLAND AVE BACKYARD - DAY

He wades barefoot through the backyard grass with his six-year-old-son
hunched on his shoulders and his trousers rolled up to his knees

NARRATOR (V0)
He considered himself a Southern loyalist and
guerrilla in a Civil War that never ended He
regretted neither his robberies nor the
seventeen murders that he laid claim to

INT KITCHEN WOODLAND AVE COTTAGE - NIGHT
JESSE sleepless at the kitchen table

NARRATOR (V0)

disguise what he thought was vulgar
primitive and depraved in his origins
EXT PRAIRIE DUSK

FADE OUT

EXT BLUE CUT (AS SEEN FROM THE SOUTHERN RIDGE) - DAY

‘Thirty feet below is a cinder roadbed the sickle curve of rails the
grade that is hard work for a locomotive Beyond that is the northern

ridge - a lower elevation - rising ten feet above the cut

EXT SOUTHERN RIDGE - DAY

FRANK JAMES (stern 38) stands back in the green darkness studying the
terrain Off-screen we hear the sound of some fool crashing through the
weeds to the rear of him FRANK opens his coat and slides his hand over

his revolver

VOICE (OFF-SCREEN)
Excuse me but I see I’ve sort of traipsed in

and interrupted you

FRANK turns to see a boy in a stovepipe hat and an overlarge black coat
that‘s cinched by a low-slung holster His hands are overhead as if a

gun is upon him

FRANK
Which one are you
BOB
Bob Ford
FRANK

Ah Charley’s brother

BOB receives this as an invitation to lower his hands He hunkers down

next to FRANK and takes off his hat

BOB
I was lying when I said I just happened down
here I’ve been looking for you I feel lousy
that I didn’t say so at the outset
FRANK digs in his pockets and extracts cigarette makings He’s not
inclined to converse

BOB
Folks sometimes take me for a nincompoop on
account of the shabby first impression I
make whereas I’ve always thought of myself
as being just a rung down from the James
brothers And well I was hoping if’I ran
into you aside from those peckerwoods I
could show you how special I am I honestly
believe I’m destined for great things Mr
James I’ve got qualities that don’t come
shining through right at the outset but give
me a chance and I‘1l get the job done - I can

guarantee you that

FRANK slimes his cigarette and strikes a match off his boot sole

FRANK
You’re not so special Mr Ford You‘re just
like any other tyro who’s prinked himself up
for an escapade Youre hoping to be a
gunslinger like those nickel books are about
but you may as well quench your mind of it
You dont have the ingredients

BOB slaps a mosquito and looks at his blood freckled palm

BOB
I’m sorry to hear you feel that way since I

put such stock in your opinions
He stands and rehats himself

BOB
As for me being a gunslinger I’ve just got
this one granddaddy Patterson Colt and a
borrowed belt to stick it in But I’ve also
got an appetite for greater things I hoped
joining up with you would put me that much
closer to getting them And that’s the plain
and simple truth of the matter

FRANK
So what do you want me to say

BOB
Youll let me be your sidekick tonight

FRANK
Sidekick

BOB
So you can examine my grit and intelligence

FRANK examines his cigarette sucks it once more and flips it onto the
roadbed
FRANK
I don’t know what it is about you but the
more you talk the more you give me the
willies I don’t believe I even want you as

close as earshot this evening

BOB
I‘m sorry-

FRANK
(interrupting)
Why don’t you go

And after a beat BOB tramps up the hill slapping weeds aside

EXT WOODS (MOVING WITH BOB TO THE GANG’S CAMP) DAY

BOB passes a number of horses reined to a piece of rope fixed between
two trees He passes MEN aged in their late teens and early twenties -
hooligans mainly boys with vulgar features and sullen eyes They
cradle shotguns and wear patched coveralls and foul looking suit coats
They are known collectively as THE CRACKERNECK BOYS and are just here
to provide ‘atmosphere’ at the robbery and easy prey for the sheriff
afterwards BOB clears this group and arrives to a view of JESSE
surrounded by the inner gang the current apostles

ROBERT WOODSON HITE (WOOD) is JESSES cousin sulking and mooning over
some imagined slight

CHARLEY FORD is BOB’S older brother who chuckles and brays and hee-
haws and who covers his left boot with a coat in order to conceal a

clubfoot

DICK LIDDIL and ED MILLER can be seen in the background working over a
cast iron pot

ED MILLER is the anxious type has a streak of spit where his spine
ought to be

DICK LIDDIL is a good-looking horse-thief

BOB eyes this group hungrily coveting admission He then crosses the
ground just as DICK LIDDIL rattles the pot and sings out

DICK
Chowtime

JESSE is the last to rise and BOB closes in on him like a valet

BOB
Am I too late to wish you a happy birthday

JESSE
Howd you know

BOB
Youd be surprised at what I’ve got stored
away I’m an authority on the James boys
JESSE
Your name isn’t Bunny Ford is it

BOB begins to nod then checks himself

BOB
Why no It’s Robert Ford
JESSE
Of course it is
BOB
Bob
JESSE
Youve never been with the gang before have
you
BOB

Oh no sirree Im a virgin At least in that
one respect if you get my meaning

JESSE takes a heaped bowl from DICK LIDDIL in his gunnysack apron He
lowers himself onto a stump and BOB squats in the dirt at his feet

JESSE
Yes

BOB
Your brother Frank and I just had a real nice
visit Must’ve been a hundred subjects
entertained having to do with the Chicago
and Alton Railroad and the assignments on
board the cars

JESSE bored closes his eyes and exercises a crick in his neck

BOB
Well the upshot was we sort of mutually
agreed that I should use my abilities as your
helper and you know apprentice So we could
be confederates together and come out of this
unscathed That was the upshot

JESSE opens his eyes and squints at BOB

JESSE
Well Buck does the figuring Do you know
what this stew needs Bob

BOB is perplexed

BOB
Dumplings
JESSE
Noodles You eat yourself some noodle stew
and your clock will tick all night You ever
see that woman over in Fayette could suck
noodles up her nose

BOB
Don’t believe I have

JESSE
Youve got canals in your head you never
dreamed of

BOB is dumbfounded

BOB
I don’t like to harp on a subject but-

JESSE
I don’t care who comes with me Never have

I’m what they call gregarious

FRANK JAMES is drinking coffee and scowling as he sits on the far side
of the fire JESSE raises his voice

JESSE
I hear you and young Stovepipe here had a
real nice visit

FRANK looks askance at BOB and flings the dregs of his coffee onto the
ground

FRANK
(terse)
Your boys have got about an acre of rock to
haul Dingus You’d better goose them down
yonder

EXT BLUE CUT RAILBED - DAY

A cotton wood tree is skidded down the bank and heaved over the
polished steel rails The CRACKERNECK BOYS carry boulders of lime and
sandstone which they fort around the tree as shovels sing and picks
splinter JESSE supervises the rock piling recommending land to be
mined for stone chewing his green cigar black

Shadows grow long and die Clouds brick overhead and brindle pink Then
crimson Then violet Then black

EXT NORTHERN RIDGE - NIGHT
BOB holds a match for JESSE as he reads the dial of a pocket watch

JESSE
You can stick with me but don’t heel I don’t

want to bust into you every time I have the
notion to change direction
BOB
I’m not a moron for Heaven’s sake

JESSE curtains his coat halves over his revolvers

JESSE
They’re supposed to have a hundred thousand
dollars in that express car at least that’s

what the gossip is

BOB
My fingers are already starting to itch

JESSE squats and strikes a match and turns up the flame of a lantern
He then wads a red flannel sleeve around the glass chimney and the

yellow light rubies

FRANK calls from above

FRANK (OFFSCREEN)
Thats ideal

EXT SOUTHERN RIDGE - NIGHT

FRANK is up on the South Ridge with DICK LIDDIL WOOD HITE ED MILLER
and CHARLEY FORD He watches the CRACKERNECK BOYS who ramble
lackadaisically along the tracks rifles hoisted dangerously crossing

paths with each other in the night

FRANK
Look at those fools They’re going to trip
and shoot each other into females

DICK
I’ll bet I can find them husbands if they do

This jollies even FRANK

EXT NORTHERN RIDGE NIGHT

JESSE holds the lantern over his pocket watch Both hands near the Ix
JESSE f

About two years ago we robbed the same

railroad only it was right in Glendale we

boarded her

BOB
I know that You might not realize it yet but
I’m a storehouse of information about the
James gang I mean I’ve followed your
careers

BOB stuffs a white handkerchief under his stovepipe hat so that it
conceals his face (One eyehole has been cut slightly lower than the
other creating the impression that he is cock-eyed and pitiable - not

at all what he had mind)

JESSE
Do you know what happened five years ago to
the day To the day What happened on
September seventh in eighteen seventysix

BOB
You made an attempt on a Northfield
Minnesota bank Wasn’t it owned by General
Ben Butler The Scourge of New Orleans

JESSE
That’s right

BOB
Knew it

JESSE

Bill Chadwell Clell Miller Charlie Pitts -
they were killed outright The Youngers have
been in prison ever since It’s painful to

recall

BOB
And you never got a plug nickel from that
bank

JESSE

So you can see how this date would have an
aroma for me

Then JESSE pricks up likes an animal might

EXT BLUE CUT RAILBED - NIGHT

He hops down the bank in three plunging steps shakes out his trouser
cuffs and kneels to put his ear to the rails The hum of the
locomotive is like insects in a jar

JESSE
Shes right on schedule Buck

EXT SOUTHERN RIDGE - NIGHT
FRANK stubs out his cigarette and turns to DICK

FRANK
Youd better go on down to Jesse

EXT BLUE CUT RAILBED - NIGHT
JESSE raises the blue bandana over his nose and places his right boot

on the rail as DICK slides down the southern cliff DICK ties a red
bandana over his face and ambles over shaking the dust from his shirt

The locomotive’s chuffing is growing loud

JESSES right foot tickles with rail vibrations

The headlamp’s aisle of white light fills the forest passage streaks
across scrub and bush then bends and floods toward JESSE He swings
his red-lantern in a yard master’s signal to stop The brakes are
engaged with an ear splitting scream Couplings bang Sparks slice off
the rails as the engine swiftly decelerates And a great cloud of steam

breaks over JESSE

Then the GANG is running and bounding and skidding down the
embankments

BOB FORD slides down like a debutante in petticoats his left hand
snatching at roots while his right unveils his eyes long enough to peek
around at the commotion

MEN rush alongside the train levering their rifles in a manner they
fancy is ghoulish and frightening

JESSE hops out of the steam and up onto the cab step and cocks his
revolver The ENGINEER cringes down behind his hands

ENGINEER
Don’t shoot Ain’t no call for that

JESSE
You two best come down from your machine and

bring a coal pick along

ENGINEER
You’ve got the gun

He obediently drops a coal pick onto the cinderbed and climbs down The
STOKER follows -— he’s scared sick sweat crawls over the filth of his
face He looks about sixteen JESSE shakes the hands of both workers

JESSE
Gentlemen I’m Jesse James the man youve

read so much about

EXT BAGGAGEEXPRESS CAR - NIGHT

The BAGGAGEMASTER and EXPRESS MESSENGER have their heads tilted out the
door at radically different heights

BAGGAGEMASTER
Opie We’re going to bolt this door from the

inside

EXPRESS MESSENGER
I’d say that’s a good idea

The door slams
INT BAGGAGEEXPRESS CAR - NIGHT

The two men stack chicken coops bags and boxes to hide the Adams
Express Company safe

BAGGAGEMASTER
If they push you to the brink do what you

must to save your own skin

EXPRESS MESSENGER
Thanks for the reminder

The MESSENGER leans himself against the doorframe and peeks through a
crack He sees
A man in a confederate officers coat and blue bandana mask limping

toward the express section with the young STOKER in tow Behind him a
young boy in a stovepipe hat points the ENGINEER in the same direction

with his revolver
EXT BAGGAGEEXPRESS CAR - NIGHT

The ENGINEER tries the doorknob Then tries again with his weight
behind it

ENGINEER
It’s locked

JESSE re-cocks his revolver

JESSE
Why don’t you smash it in

The ENGINEER grunts the coal pick up and swings it into the door near
the latch The wood splinters loudly He has to tug hard to extricate

the embedded spike

JESSE
(to BOB)
The locked doors and the smashing them down
that’s a little skit we run through each time
— sort of like grace before dinner

‘The ENGINEER swings again
INT BAGGAGEEXPRESS CAR - SAMETIME

The wood screams and folds inward from the blow The MESSENGER sees
that they’11 get in anyway and goes for the bolts

MESSENGER
All right All right You can come in now

JESSE socks the door open heaves his chest onto the threshold and
knees himself into the room DICK LIDDIL ED MILLER and the comelately
CHARLEY FORD follow him A lantern is passed up as JESSE lifts packages
and shakes them and guesses at their contents

JESSE
Thats a woman’s satchel all fancy bead work

and paper flowers

MESSENGER
(nervous grin)
Could be

JESSE smashes another box on a nail and snags it open finding inside a
photograph of a child in an oval frame the cheek torn by a nail He
looks at it a moment and then glares at the frightened MESSENGER

JESSE
I want you to open that safe

The MESSENGER looks to the BAGGAGEMASTER for council - but the man’s
head is dowm He looks back at JESSE with his nervous smile CHARLEY
FORD steps forward and strikes him over the skull with his pistol The
man drops to his knees blood shoelacing his face The BAGGAGEMASTER

backs to wall in horror

ED MILLER
You didnt have to bop him Charley

JESSE
Yes he did They need the convincing They
got their company rules and I got my mean
streak and that’s how we get things done

CHARLEY grins with accomplishment and JESSE clears some registers off
the only safe he can see

JESSE
Come over here and attend to this now

We hear a wild and scrambled off-screen fusillade and DICK leans
outside to see what’s going on

EXT BLUE CUT RAILBED - NIGHT

The CRACKERNECKS are firing at TWO FIGURES crouching with a red
lantern FRANK JAMES hollers for them to cease and after a further

twenty rounds they do

DICK sees BOB FORD squatting in the weeds standing guard over the
STOKER and ENGINEER his cocked revolver up next to his cheek

DICK
(calling)
Scare ya

BOB stands sheepishly

BOB
I couldn’t tell what on earth was going on

INT BAGGAGEEXPRESS CAR - NIGHT

The EXPRESS MESSENGER jerks the company vault door open CHARLEY FORD
empties the contents of the safe into a grain sack which he hands to
JESSE JESSE puzzles over it’s contents
JESSE
Isn’t no hundred thousand dollars in here

Dick
DICK looks into the grain sack

DICK
Im real disappointed

JESSE turns on the EXPRESS MESSENGER

JESSE
Get down on your knees
MESSENGER
Why
JESSE
You oughta pray I’m going to kill you
ED MILLER
panic)
Hey
JESSE
Get down
MESSENGER

Youll have to make me

JESSE
All right

JESSE socks the man with his pistol and he drops like empty clothes
JESSE looks at him for a moment then cocks his pistol and puts it
against the unconscious man’s head ED MILLER reacts with horror

ED MILLER
Don’t shoot him

JESSE grins uncocks the pistol and picks up the grain sack

JESSE
Don’t you tell me what I can and can’t do

EXT BLUE CUT RAILBED - NIGHT

BOB FORD standing over the ENGINEER and the STOKER watches as JESSE
jumps down from the EXPRESS CAR JESSE encourages the MESSENGER and
BAGGAGEMASTER outside with his gun The MESSENGER staggers over towards
BOB bleeding profusely and crashes down into the weeds BOB gapes at
the wound in panic

JESSE
We’re going to go through the cars If any of
them so much as twitch give their coconuts a
sockdolager that’s a language they
understand

INT PASSENGER CAR - NIGHT

WOOD HITE’S boot slams the door aside and he enters an eye-holed
flour sack over his head his twelve-gauge thrust forward

WOOD HITE
Throw up your hands you sons-a-bitches

And for emphasis he slaps a MAN in the mouth
Then FRANK JAMES enters in his gray coat and yellow bandana

He sees thirty MEN either cowering or flinching or accusing him with
their eyes while the WIVES scrunch down behind their husbands’

shoulders

He strides down the aisle imperious as Victoria’s consort his
bootheels barking on the oakwood flooring He scowls and lingers over
any who seem recalcitrant ticking a button or collar with his

Remington revolver

FRANK
Are any of you preachers

No one raises a hand

FRANK
Are any of you widows

Some frown with curiosity

FRANK
We never rob preachers or widows

Four hands shoot up

FRANK
No no you’re too late

FRANK nods to the rear of the coach and JIM CUMMINS scuttles forward
and punches his revolver into the into the coat of a man

JIM CUMMINS
Im Jesse James ya damned yellow dog Gimme
all your money

The MAN fiddles in his coat and produces a worn envelope full of bills
and an English gold watch

A bearded man with spectacles hands FRANK JAMES a roll of bills but
FRANK has a hunch about him and puts a cocked revolver to his forehead

FRANK
Delve a little deeper

The man turns up a further hundred dollars

JESSE raps on the doorglass with his gun Frank swivels and waves him
in DICK and CHARLEY follow

FRANK
Just work your way to the middle

The GANG make their way down the coach with sacks stealing coins
dollars watches bracelets rings stickpins pendants

Children wail in corners several women have become hysterical

Men sit in chairs with blank faces their hands lumped in their laps
having lost fortunes their crabbed savings the cost of a cottage the
auction sale of six Holstein cows a laggard Silver Anniversary watch

EXT PASSENGER CAR PLATFORM - LATER

A dispirited JESSE exits onto the platform where he sees FRANK and some
of the others shedding loot into a flour sack WOOD HITE and MILLER
pass by him with fire axes A young BRAKEMAN sits nearby looking

bankrupt

JESSE
How much did you lose

BRAKEMAN
Fifty cents and that was all I had

JESSE digs into his grain sack and hands the BRAKEMAN a dollar fifty

JESSE
Here’s the principal and interest on your

money

The sound of wood splintering is heard and JESSE turns to see WOOD HITE
and ED MILLER attacking the bedding and boxes in the sleeper carriage
The whole affair degenerating into a carousal JESSE shouts at them

JESSE
Okay Enough Let’s vamoose

EXT SOUTHERN RIDGE - NIGHT

The gang scrabble up the bank to the woods We follow BOB to where
CHARLEY waits with the gathered horses BOB removes his mask with the

cut out eyes

CHARLEY
I was in top form tonight Did you see me
roast that one gent for standing on his cash

BOB
No I missed that I was outside y’see

CHARLEY
He kind of skidded when he walked was how I
knew And his wife she was in a state her
beady little eyes all squinched up

BOB
Really took the cake did she

CHARLEY
Oh my yes Jesse’s gonna be satisfied with

me

EXT NEARBY CORNFIELD - NIGHT

JESSE’S horse prances impatiently as he removes a document from his
shirt and displays it for the assembled GANG

JESSE

This here is a proclamation by the governor
of Missouri

(beat he glares for effect)
It mentions Glendale and how certain parties
confederated to steal what was on that train
It goes on about the Winston shebang last
summer and then it says that the governor
one Thomas T Crittenden is offering a
reward of five thousand dollars for the
arrest and delivery of Frank James or Jesse
James to the sheriff of Daviess County It
goes on to offer a further reward of five
thousand dollars for our conviction of either
of these crimes The governor has a regular
toothache over the James gang My guess is
he‘ll agree to just about anything thing if
it‘’ll make the pain go away

(beat)
But you won’t none of you get away with
bargaining or making exchanges I’ve got a
wife and two children I’ve got to look out
for

ED MILLER
You can trust me

Jesse rocks back and gives himself over to a long thought before
replying

JESSE
I know I can Ed

EXT KANSAS CITY OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

The JAMES the FORD BROTHERS and WOOD HITE ride into KANSAS CITY under a
cold rain that knuckles their hats and sinks their horses deep in the

mire
INT WOODLAND AVE COTTAGE - NIGHT

ZEE JAMES is asleep on the sofa JESSE creaks open the kitchen door and
surprises her awake with a kiss

INT WOODLAND AVE KITCHEN - NIGHT

ZEE boils water

JESSE
I was at a cattle auction in Independence
Had a good day too

She doesn’t look up from the saucepan

ZEE
So you’ve got money again

JESSE
Come out of it real satisfactory

He jumps up from his chair and ganders out at the red barn He can’t
sit still

JESSE
Guess who I ran into

She gives JESSE a wifely look and removes a jar from the pantry shelf

JESSE
Buck for one Then Wood Hite and two coves
of his They’re with the animals right now

ZEE
They do satisfactory at the auction too

JESSE
(grins)
About the most they ask is that they come out
of a swap meet with all their fingers and

toes

He adjusts a dry hat on his head and then without justifying his
exit heads out to the stables

INT BARN WOODLAND AVE - NIGHT

Coal-oil lanterns gladden the interior of the barn but FRANK JAMES is
gloomy and glaring at the younger men’s slipshod management of their
horses He sees JESSE appear at the Dutch door and grumpily seats
himself on a long bench his legs wide his fingers joined around a
yellow cigarette The JAMES brothers do not speak

EXT BARN WOODLAND AVE - NIGHT

JESSE stands just inside the sloshing eave peering at his older brother
with melancholy It’s a moment before he perceives that BOB FORD is
standing to his right

JESSE
You must‘ve creeped up on cat’s paws

BOB
I’ll wager that’s the first and last time
youll ever be caught off-guard

JESSE
How old are you kid

BOB
Twenty (beat) Except I won’t really be
twenty until January (He scratches his
sleeve apologetically) I’m nineteen

JESSE

You feel older than that though don’t you
BOB

Yes I do
JESSE

You enjoy yourself this evening

BOB
I was strung too high for much pleasure

JESSE seems to think this an appropriate remark

JESSE
Do you like tea

INT BARN WOODLAND AVE - LATER
FRANK gathers two horse blankets and makes his way to an empty stall

CHARLEY
Do you think the sheriff’s out already

FRANK
Generally is

CHARLEY slinks over to the stall and watches as the grim man hangs his
coat

CHARLEY
I wasn’t just flapping my lips about my kid
brother and me What I figured was if you and
Jesse could gauge our courage and daring you
just might make us your regular sidekicks

FRANK shoots him a look of umbrage as he spreads out a wool blanket on
the straw

FRANK
You’re beginning to sound like Bob

CHARLEY
I’1l be square with you it was Bob who put
me up to it He’s got plans for the James
boys that I can’t even get the hang of
they’re that complicated

FRANK settles into repose wrapping another horse blanket around hin
FRANK
You might as well forget everything about
that because there’1l be no more monkey
business after tonight you can jot it down
in your diary September seventh eighteen
eighty-one the James gang robbed one last
train at Blue Cut and gave up their
nightriding for good

CHARLEY
How will you make your living

FRANK is smoking a cigarette with his eyes shut

FRANK
Maybe I‘1l sell shoes

EXT WOODLAND AVE PORCH - NIGHT

JESSE and BOB come out onto the porch with a candle and two cigars
JESSE lowers into a rocker and BOB takes the mating chair BOB bends

forward over the flame and lights his cigar

BOB
I can’t believe I woke up this morning
wondering if my Daddy would loan me his
overcoat and here it is just past midnight
and I’ve already robbed a railroad and I’m
sitting in a rocking chair chatting with none
other than Jesse James

JESSE
It‘s a wonderful world

BOB
Have you ever heard outlaws call dollar bills
‘Williams’ I read that in Morrisons
Sensational Series You see Bill is a
nickname for William

JESSE
I see

BOB
You haven’t heard anybody say it though

JESSE
Can’t say so

BOB
You know what I’ve got right next to my bed
The Trainrobbers or a story of the James
Boys by R W Stevens Many’s the night I’ve
stayed up with my mouth open and my eyes
jumping out reading about your escapades in
the Wide Awake Library

JESSE
Theyre all lies you know
BOB
‘Course they are

JESSE
You don’t have to keep smoking that if it’s

making you bungey

BOB is relieved He reaches over the banister and drops the cigar ina
puddle JESSE smiles

JESSE
You know what Charley once told me about you
He said you had a shoebox practically filled
with James boys mementoes

BOB submerges his resentment

BOB
That must have been a couple of years ago

JESSE
Or maybe it was Bunny who did that

BOB
You‘re making sport of me aren’t you

JESSE catches BOBS wrist and puts a finger to his lips A stooped MAN
with a lunchpail tramps through the rainmuck of the street

JESSE
(calling out)
Evening Chas

CHAS
JT

JESSE reaches into a tin under his chair and hauls up two writhing
snakes BOB flinches

JESSE
You scared

BOB
Just surprised a little

JESSE
They aren‘t as succulent as I like and
they’re the devil to clean but if a man skins
them and fries them in garlic and oil -
mercy it’s good eating

BOB
I’ve never been that hungry

JESSE unfolds a four-inch knife and lifts the head of a snake on the
blade

JESSE
I give them names
BOB
Such as
JESSE

Such as enemies I give them the names of
enemies

He lays the snakes on the arm of his chair and carefully saws off their
heads with his knife The bodies curl and thrash He flicks the heads

into the grass

TIM swats the river with a washed-up board JESSE calls to him

JESSE
Don’t get yourself all soaked now you little

honyock
JESSE starts putting on his socks and boots
JESSE

You ever hear any gossip about my father and
Frank’s being two different men
BOB
Yes

JESSE
They say that was the reason my papa went
West in the Gold Rush he couldn’t support
the shame of it What do you think of a story

like that

BOB
I’m more personally interested in what you

think of it

JESSE

(angry)
I think it’s a goddamned lie

BOB
I’m with you then and I won’t hear another
word on it if the subject ever comes up

BOB removes his hat and scratches his head

BOB
Since we’re telling stories have you heard
the one about the James gang robbing the
railroad

JESSE
You‘re not giving me enough clues

BOB
It’s a funny story

JESSE shakes his head and takes another drink

BOB
You see the James gang is robbing this
railroad train like you do and on board is
this Quaker minister some old coot with a
long beard and a mean disposition He’s got
this pinched-up wife with him and she’s
shivering with fright and clutching his
sleeve You sure you havent heard this

JESSE
I would have stopped you by now

BOB
How’s it go Ive gotta get this right Oh I
guess it’s you You stand in this railroad
coach and you holler ‘I’m Jesse James And
here’s what Im gonna do I’m gonna grab all
your money I‘m gonna grab all your jewelry
I‘m gonna grab everything you own The
preacher’s wife is cringing now and cowering
behind the old coot and you say ‘And then
I’m gonna go down the aisle and rape all you
women ‘
JESSE
I don’t like the way this story’s headed

BOB
Well everyone knows it’s not true Jess
it’s just sort of comical Anyway the Quaker
ups and says ‘Surely you wouldn’t rape a
preachers wife’ And the wife gives him an
elbow and says ‘Shut up Homer It’s Jesses
train Let him rob it the way he wants to’

JESSE isn’t laughing

BOB
You don’t think it’s funny

JESSE
Well hell how could I if it isn’t true

BOB
Jokes don’t need to be Jesse

JESSE
You’re gonna have to explain why I oughta
laugh then

BOB
(impatient)
Why don’t we just forget it
(then scared)
I didn’t mean to sound sharp just then

JESSE adjusts his jacket sleeves

JESSE

Ive got a story for you that’s true as a
razor This’1l give you an example of putting
aman in his place and it don’t depend upon
any prevaricating Once me and Frank were
riding in the countryside and got hungry so
we went up to this farmhouse and asked would
this widow lady make us some supper

BOB
Oh that one

JESSE
You’ve heard it

BOB
Only about twenty times

JESSE is as still as a shut-down machine

BOB
Id love the chance to hear you tell it
though I imagine you’ll make it more
interesting

JESSE
‘I‘ll gladly pay you’ I say and she said
that was all right we looked like genuine
Christians and she’d do us the good turn
Kid I want to tell you that was one
scrumptious supper She went all out But
Frank saw she was crying and when he asked
why she said the mortgage was coming due and
that the loan manager was going to be there
any minute to repossess the place And her a
poor Widow Can you imagine Well now Frank
and me we insist on paying her something
and you know what we gave her

BOB
Enough to pay off the mortgage

JESSE
You have heard this one

BOB
But no one ever said the supper was
scrumptious This is fascinating

JESSE
So we gave her what she needed and we go and
on the highway whos coming our way but the
loan manager He greets us but doesn’t give
Frank and me a second thought he’s that
greedy to get hold of that farm Much to his
surprise of course she paid him off and in
no time he was plodding along the road with
his wallet bulging his coat out and his grin
on a little tighter And thats when Frank
and me come out of the woods with masks on
and steal all our money back

JESSE laughs uproariously slapping his thigh like a plowboy

BOB
And you‘re saying that’s a true story
JESSE
Is
BOB
Jesse
JESSE
(testy)

You calling me a liar

TIM crawls back up from the river and plops down in his father’s lap
He throws a rock and the river glunks

JESSE
Dont do that son You’1ll scare all the

fishes away
TIM

Daddy I’m boring

JESSE
(laughs)
You mean you’re bored

TIM
Yes -

JESSE hugs the boy to him

JESSE
Maybe a fish will come and get you all
excited

TIM

I don’t like fishing-

JESSE
Sure you do I do You must

The boy sinks into his father’s jacket The river is the only noise

JESSE
You know what we are Tim We’re nighthawks
Were the ones who go out at night and guard
everything so people can sleep in peace
We’ve got our eyes peeled no one’s going to
slip anything past us

7 BOB

“ Ive got something
JESSE
You sure
BOB
It’s heavy
JESSE sidles next to him and clearly struggles with the temptation to
seize the pole from BOB’S grip
JESSE
Don’t horse it kid Bring it up easy
BOB steps on the bamboo pole and hauls the weight up with both hands
The catch is heaved onto the river bank Its a gruesome fish a
prehistoric thing that seems overdue for extinction Round as a dog
with feelers that move like thumbs on its skull TIM backs into his
fathers leg
JESSE
God damn it but that’s an ugly thing
Its teeth mesh and unmesh with a click Its gill wings undulate Jesse
is disgusted
Newer”

JESSE
Kill him kid

BOB takes a burning stick from the fire and stabs it into the fish over
and over again

JESSE
That‘s enough

JESSE glares at BOB as though he’s been given a sign and will now act
accordingly

wraps it in the eye-holed white handkerchief He tucks this little
bundle into the box alongside about lurid nickel books about the James
gang civil war photographs yellowed newspaper articles and other
James brothers’ mementoes Then he squirms his boots off and strips out

of his month old clothes

BOB comes downstairs in his filthy union suit He carries a towel a
cake of soap and a tile brush

tank BOB bends over to rinse soap from his hair and then shakes water
like a hound Then he notices an amused DICK LIDDIL standing as close

as a tailor

BOB
How long you been there

DICK
Just now arrived Did I miss much

BOB
Not unless you’ve never seen a man wash his
dirty carcass before

DICK
Youve got a big Pecker for being such a
little squirrel

BOB
Is that what you come over here to see

DICK bends for the towel and some of the good nature slides from his
face

DICK
Your brother said Jesse kept you in Kansas
City some extra days What was the reason

Bob rubs his hair wild

BOB
Well I’m not at liberty to say exactly I
will confess we had an adventure or two the
like of which you’ll never experience but as
for details and whatnot that would be
confidential

BOB straddles the tank and surrounds himself with the towel

DICK
Let me ask you this did Jesse mention that

me and Cummins were in cahoots

BOB

Is that so
DICK

Oh dear I’ve went on and said too much
BOB

DICK
Ho You‘re darn tootin’

BOB
Don’t see why hed give a dang since he and
Frank’ve called it quits and scattered the
James gang hither and yon

DICK studies BOB but sees neither cunning nor deception

DICK
Boy you really are as slow as peach mold
you know that Tucker Bassham’s already gone
for ten years and whiskyhead Ryans in jail
soon as one or the other feels the urge he
can give the government all he knows about
Jesse and then go out on the street scot-
free Jesse don’t want us giving ourselves up
and he don’t want us getting caught and he
don‘t want us gathering loot except if he’s
in charge

BOB rolls his eyes in exasperation then clutches the towel around him
and reaches down for his holster DICK pins it with his boot

DICK
Let me carry your six-gun for you Bob

BOB
All right

They take no more than two strides towards the house before DICK has
insisted the revolver under the towel with the barrel against BOB’S

scrotum

DICK
You and me we horse around and josh each
other with lies and tomfoolery but now and
then we need to get down to brass tacks
Which is you so much as mention my name to

DICK
You know where I stand on these matters and
that’s all there is to it We can be friendly
as pigs from now on

BOB
Could be I‘1l never see Jesse again

DICK draws the screen door wide for Bob and then restricts it with his
shoulders as he pries his boots off with the bootjack

find himself in the neighborhood and call on

tipped over a cat on the kitchen cutting board licking something from

the sink

JESSE
You arent much of a housekeeper are you

ED MILLER
You didn’t just happen by

Why not
JESSE looks at the gun and MILLER puts it on the kitchen table
JESSE sits himself down on the ringed rug He nods toward the sagging
couch

JESSE
Go ahead and take a load off your feet

MILLER does as instructed His clothes are wrinkled as crumpled paper
his fingernails are outlined with filth a corner of his mouth is
stained with tobacco juice

JESSE
You ought to get yourself a wife
ED MILLER
ZI was going to ask Martha - Charley’s sister
I was going to ask her if she could imagine
it but I guess Wood has plans of his own
and theres always Dick Liddil getting in the
way Ive give it some thought

the floor

gaze on the yard

ED MILLER
Its just talk probably

JESSE
To shut ‘em up

ED MILLER
Just talk

JESSE
Cummins say anything else

ED MILLER
Nope That was it basically

JESSE
It don‘t explain why you’re scared

MILLER looks at him with watery eyes and spit on his mouth light
glinting off the oils on his skin

ED MILLER
I’m in the same position you see I was
petrified when I saw you ride up

JESSE
I just happened by Ed

ED MILLER
Suppose you heard gossip though Suppose you
heard Jim Cummins come by here You mightve
thought we were planning to capture you or
Frank and get that reward Isnt true but
you might’ve suspected it

JESSE gets up and jiggles a pants leg over his boot

JESSE
Haven’t heard a lick of gossip lately

JESSE looks out at the road and at the sky which is pink with sunset
The road he looks down seems never-ending

JESSE
I want to put your mind at rest

ED MILLER (OFF-SCREEN)
I’ve got six hundred dollars stashed away I
don’t need any governor’s reward

JESSE
It’s the principle of the thing too

MILLER pulls himself to his feet and sweeps his hand over a plate to
shoo away flies

JESSE
How about if we go for a ride I could buy
you something to eat in town and then be on

my way

They head westerly the horses easing into a graceful lope and then
into a walk

his cinch slows his horse

JESSE
You go on ahead partner I’11 catch up

MILLER slumps in his saddle tears forming in his eyes JESSE gentles
his gun from the leather holster and then jogs his horse ahead MILLER
stops on the road but can’t persuade himself to drop a hand to his
pistol or even to turn around

JESSE
(rounding him)
You ought to get better at lying

JESSE trips the hammer and a cartridge ball pounds into MILLERS cheek
snaps his head to the side and propels his body off the mare so that he

wallops onto the road JESSE gets off his horse and tugs at ED MILLER’S
legs towing the body towards a cluster of Elm trees

oo The sitting room conversations were all about

Blue Cut that week the Kansas City
newspapers carried front-page articles about
the arrests of John Bugler John Land and
Creed Chapman in shacks near Glendale Creed
Chapman would lose forty-two pounds while
imprisoned and John Land was rumored to be so
apprehensive about reprisal by Jesse James
that he refused to even mention the man‘s

name
INT DICK’S BEDROOM KANSAS CITY - NIGHT

(MATTIE) to the light spilling through the bedroom doorway He seems

transfixed by it A sound begins to build Hairs stand up on the back
of his neck He retrieves his Navy Colt from under his pillow and

slides quietly out of bed

watches the two men climb down from their saddles

EXT PORCH BILL FORD’S FARMHOUSE DAY
The boy creaks open the door and comes outside

ALBERT
Hello

But he’s ignored as JESSE reconnoiters the yard and then gravely
ascends the steps DICK can see past the nervous ALBERT to the kitchen
where TWO WOMEN stir clothes in a laundry boiler JESSE peers into the

other rooms

ALBERT
Are you friends of my Pa’s

JESSE
Were friends of Jim Cummins

ALBERT
Oh

ALBERT gains thirty years - becomes sullen
‘ALBERT

Well it so happens he’s been gone since
August and never said where he gone to

DICK
I’m Matt Collins

DICK shakes the boy’s hand

ALBERT
Very happy to meet you

JESSE clenches the boys hand and introduces himself

JESSE
Dick Turpin

ALBERT
Pleased to make your acquaintance

JESSE smiles around the cigar but stalls the shake and crushes ALBERT’S
hand until the boy winces ALBERT is about to cry out when JESSE clamps
his hand over the boy’s mouth and yanks him into the yard DICK softly

shuts the mahogany door
EXT YARD BILL FORD’S FARM - DAY

JESSE manhandles the boy toward a red barn stopping to slam ALBERT into
a cottonwood tree so that he loses his wind DICK shambles after them

looking apprehensive and ashamed checking the road

INT BARN BILL FORDS FARM - DAY
JESSE throws the boy to the ground and steps a boot onto his throat

DICK
Come on Jesse He’s just a kid

JESSE glowers at DICK for letting his name slip then returns his
attention to the choking boy

JESSE
He knows where his uncle Jim is and that’s

gonna make him old pretty soon
ALBERT brawls and kicks at JESSE

DICK
Maybe he doesn’t know

JESSE
He knows

JESSE falls to his knees on the boy’s biceps ALBERT cries out JESSE
clamps the boy’s mouth shut

JESSE
You need to ask and ask sometimes Sometimes
a child won’t remember much at first and then
it‘ll all come back Just tell me about your
Uncle Jim is Where’d he sneak off to
where’s he hidin’ out

He twists the boy’s ear like a clock wind-up and ALBERT’S body racks
wildly his boots thud the earth JESSE leans over to examine the
injury
JESSE

My gosh I believe it’s about to tear

sweetie Just a little more to get her

started then I can rip your ear off like a

page from a book

DICK
Let the kid go

JESSE
He’s lying

DICK
Jesus he can’t even talk

JESSE
Where’s Jim (beat) Where’s Jim Where’s Jim
Where’s Jim

DICK
(slapping JESSE’S hat off his head)

Quit it
JESSE sits back and rubs his hands on his thighs ALBERT weeps but
can’t make words He wipes his nose and eyes and shudders with sobs as
he gasps for air When at last he speaks his voice is scaled like a
childs

ALBERT
You bastard I don’t know where he is and you
won’t believe me and you never even gave me a
chance You kept my mouth shut I never know
where Jim is or when he comes so leave me
alone get off me you son of a bitch
(grunts and bucks under JESSE and
shouts )
Get off

JESSE rises and ALBERT rolls over crying DICK walks out in disgust

EXT YARD BILL FORDS FARM - DAY

DICK walks around the barn to the road his face splotched crimson with
fury He climbs onto his mount

When JESSE comes forward DICK looks away squints down the road in
order to talk

DICK
Im worn out Jesse I cant- My mind’s all
tangled anyway Little deals like that just
make me feel dirty

DICK turns to gauge JESSE’S reaction to this and is astonished to see
him caved forward into his bay horse his face flattened into its mane
in a grimace of affliction noiselessly crying

DICK
You all right Jesse

JESSE nuzzles into the horse’s hide and mutters words we cant make
out

ALBERT limps toward the Ford house cupping his left ear and wiping his
nose with his sleeve

DICK
Maybe you better ride on to wherever it is
youre living now and maybe I‘ll sell this
animal and skeedaddle on over to Mrs
Boltons and you know apologize to the
Fords put everything in it’s best light and
so on

JESSE scrubs at his eyes He fumbles his left boot at the stirrup until
at last it finds purchase and he swings up

JESSE
I must be going crazy

And he rides off without another word

concussion that jostles the roam

He grits his teeth when ELIAS grips his ankle and sags back with a moan
when ELIAS lifts it onto the mattress

BOB steps into the room and stands over WOOD

BOB
Just in case you never noticed It was me who
shot you I don’t harbor any ill feelings
toward you I was just scared and looking out

BOB shies into the kitchen

JESSE

JESSE moves - it’s as if his acts are miracles of invention wondrous to

behold

JESSE
I never take off my gunbelt

WILBUR
Good thinking

JESSE walks back to his coffee and CHARLEY hitches aside

JESSE
Hurt your leg

CHARLEY
I slipped off the roof and smacked down into
a snowbank like a ton of stupidness One
second I’m screaming ‘Whoa Nelly’ and the
next second poof I’m neck deep in snow

JESSE
The roof Whatever possessed you to climb the
roof in December

CHARLEY loses his smile and sees the criticism in BOB’S expression

CHARLEY
(stammering)
There was a kite- what am I saying There was
a cat A cat was on the roof and I went after
him A tom cat Yowling and whatall and I

slipped
CHARLIE rubs his eye and coughs into his fist

JESSE
I thought maybe your clubfoot was gaining on

WILBUR and CHARLEY guffaw as if this is funny MARTHA carries a bowl of
ham hocks to the table

BOB
Dick was here for a little bit and then he
went on to Kansas City to be with his wife

JESSE gives BOB a look and then pretends he hasn‘t heard He begins to
tickle IDA’S side and stomach saying ‘Kootchy Kootch’ until the girl
is sore with giggles and the fun is over

MARTHA
Oh quit it you two

CHARLEY casts about anxiously for something to say

CHARLEY
Heres a cute story Jess Bobby was - what -
eleven or twelve And you were by far his
most admired personage He couldn’t get
enough He practically ate those newspaper
Stories up It was Jesse this Jesse that
4“ from sunrise to sunset

JESSE
Fascinating

CHARLEY
No there‘s more This is cute We’re at
Supper and Bob asks ‘You know what size boot

Jesse wears’

BOB
Jesse doesn’t care about this Charley

CHARLEY
Shush now Bob Let me tell it Bob says he
Says ‘You know what size boot Jesse wears
Six and a half’ He says ‘Ain’t that a dinky
little boot for a man five feet eight inches
tall’ Well I decide to josh hima little
you know so I said ‘He doesn’t have toes t

is why’
BOB
Really stupid
CHARLEY

Then my momma pipes up and says ‘He what’
and I’m not letting on I Say ‘He was
dangling his feet off a culvert and a catfish
nibbled his toes off’ Well Bob taxed
himself trying to picture it until Momma let
on that I was playing him the fool And Bob
says - I want to get this right What was it
exactly you said Bob
BOB

(reluctant)
I said ‘If theyd been catfish he’d a
rilled them with his forty-four’

CHARLEY laughs and claps his hands

CHARLEY
Yep that’s the exact words exactly

Jesse looks at BOB without comment

BOB
It‘d be a good joke if it was funny

CHARLEY
Youve got to picture it though Bob saying
you would’ve shot them catfish then smiling
in every direction real satisfied with
himself Oh And you know what he said next
He said ‘You need your toes’

WILBUR -
Howd I miss this Where was I

CHARLEY
You need your toes

JESSE
‘Course you do

CHARLEY
Isn’t that a cute story

JESSE suppresses his opinion He regards BOB in a way that implies the
sight is disappointing He skewers a cigar with the tine of his fork

JESSE
Give me some other conversations Bob

BOB
(reluctant)
You know how children are

JESSE
It’d be cheery to hear what you fancied about
me It might make me laugh and forget my
cares and woes

BOB
I can’t recall much of any consequence

CHARLEY
I got one This one’s about as crackerjack as
the one about your toes

BOB
Which

CHARLEY
About how much you and Jesse have in common

JESSE
Why don’t you tell it Bob if you remember

BOB
Well if youll pardon my saying so it is
interesting the many ways you and I overlap
and whatnot You begin with our Daddies Your
daddy was a pastor of the New Hope Baptist
Church my daddy was pastor of a church at
Excelsior Springs You’re the youngest of the
three James boys I’m the youngest of the
five Ford boys You had twins as sons I have
twins as sisters Between Charley and me is
another brother Wilbur here (with six
letters in his name) between Frank and you
was a brother Robert also with six letters
Robert of course is my Christian name You
have blue eyes I have blue eyes Youre five
feet eight inches tall I’m five feet eight
inches tall Ohme I must’ve had a list as
long as your nightshirt when I was twelve
but I’ve lost some curiosities over the

years

JESSE is as still as a photograph Smoke spirals from his cigar in a
line and then squiggles above him like sloppy handwriting but his eyes
are active cagey calculating He comes carefully to life and taps

ashes into his coffee cup

JESSE
Did I ever mention that scalawag George
Shepherd to y’all

He reaches over and grips BOB’S forearm in apology while saying

JESSE (CONTD)
George was one of Quantrill’s lieutenants and
he gave me a story like Bob’s is why I
thought of him giving me everything we had
in common and so on just so he could join
the gang How could I know he had a grudge
against me and was lying to get on my good
side I said ‘Come aboard George Glad to
have ya’ George thought he was pretty smart
‘Cept he wasn’t He rode into camp one
morning and about twenty guns opened up on
him But he only had one eye - and you need
two eyes to get Jesse

BOB and WILBUR laugh for a suitable period of time and JESSE laughs
until tears come out of his eyes

BOB
You oughtn’t think of me like you do George

Shepherd
JESSE
You just brought him to mind

BOB
It’s not very flattering

MARTHA waitresses around them collecting cups and saucers

JESSE
Good eating Martha
MARTHA
Glad you liked it
BOB
How come George had a grudge against you
JESSE
Hmmm
BOB

You said George Shepherd had a grudge against
you and I’ve just been wondering what it was

JESSE
Oh George asked me to protect this nephew of
his during the war and it so happens the kid
had five thousand dollars on him The kid
winds up killed and all the money swiped
from him and when George was in prison
someone whispers to him it was Jesse James
slit the boys throat

CHARLEY
Just mean gossip was it

JESSE
Bob’s the expert put it to him

BOB rises from the table like a stamping boy in a snit

JESSE
I’ve make him cranky

WILBUR snickers

BOB
I‘ve been through this before is all Once
people get around to making fun of me they
just don’t ever let up

MARTHA
Someone’s speaking awful fresh over there

BOB is forced to walk past JESSE to get to the main room JESSE kicks a
leg across BOB’S path clouting the floorboards with his boot BOB
glances down at his bogus grin - the suggestion of malice beneath his

antics

JESSE
I don’t want you to skip off to your room and
pout without knowing why I dropped by for
this visit

BOB
I suppose you’re going to tell us how sorry
you are that you had to slap my cousin Albert
around

Such great heat seems to come then from JESSE’S eyes that BOB glances
away as if from sunlight but in a second the man cools and says

JESSE
I come to ask one of you two Fords to ride
with me on a journey or two I guess weve
agreed it ought to be Charley youve been
acting sort of testy

BOB stands pale and silent Then he steps around JESSE’S boot and
calmly climbs the stairs to the upper room

INT 2” FLOOR BEDROOM HARBISON HOMESTEAD NIGHT

run into walls and fence posts

JESSE
I’ve been holding a discussion with myself
over if I ought to tell you this or no My
good side won out and well I’d like to make
a clean breast of things

CHARLEY
My mind is cobwebby yet is the only
drawback

JESSE crosses close

JESSE
Can you hear me when I whisper this low

Just barely

JESSE
You knew I went to Kentucky

CHARLEY
Yes

JESSE
I come back through Saline County and thought
to myself ‘Why not stop by and see Ed
Miller’ So I do and things aren’t to my
satisfaction at all Ed’s got himself worked
up over something and I can tell he’s lying
like a rug and I say to myself ‘Enough’s
enough’ and I say to Ed ‘Come on Ed let’s
go for a ride’ Do you understand what Im

saying

CHARLEY
Going for a ride is like giving him what-for

JESSE
Exactly Ed and Jesse they argued on the
road and when push came to shove Jesse shot

and killed him

CHARLEY
Jesse did

JESSE
You‘ve got it

CHARLEY
You

JESSE pats CHARLEY’S knee

JESSE
So you see Your cousin got off easy I was
only playing with Albert

CHARLEY
Ive made him squeal once or twice myself
I’m just not as thorough as you are

JESSE
You want to swap a tale with me now

CHARLEY
(sudden fright
I don’t get your meaning

JESSE
If you’ve got something to confess in
exchange it seems to me it’d only be right
for you to spit it out now
(beat)
About Wood Hite for example

CHARLEY
I’ve been saying over and over again I can’t
figure out where he’s gone I‘m not going to
change my story just to have something to

spit
JESSE
Why was your brother so agitated
CHARLEY
Which
JESSE
Bob
CHARLEY

it’s just his way He’s antsy
JESSE retreats Sits in a chair

JESSE
You can go back to sleep now

CHARLEY
You got me agitated now you see

JESSE
Just ain’t no peace with Jesse around You

ought to pity my poor wife
CHARLEY
Ed Miller was a good friend of mine He
introduced me to you at that one poker game
I‘m a little angry with you if you want the
God’s honest truth

JESSE crosses his ankles and shuts his eyes He pushes his hands deep
into his pockets

JESSE

INT GRAND BALLROOM ST JAMES HOTEL - NIGHT

GOVENOR CRITTENDEN speaks to a large crowd of GENTLEMEN in tails and
LADIES in satin gowns

CRITTENDEN
I deem it a great privilege on this glorious
occasion to recognize publicly the
intelligent and efficient assistance that
Captain Henry Craig has thus far provided the
State of Missouri and myself in our Joint
quest to extirpate the James band from
Jackson County The task Henry Craig has
assumed requires fearless courage
extraordinary vigilance and an unerring
selection of instrumentalities

BOB lingers against a pillar on the fringes

BOB
(mutters to himself)
You’re not so great

A WOMAN nearby glares at the comment

CRITTENDEN
My wife has just signaled that I should leave
well enough alone so I‘1l leave you all with
the wish for an enjoyable evening and with
the hope that I may have the Pleasure of
meeting each of you before this celebration
is ended -

LATER

BOB jostles through the crowd insinuating himself closer to
CRITTENDEN He raises his hand in a juvenile wave and is about to give
his name when he’s grasped by two POLICEMEN They clamp his mouth shut
and sock him in the groin He collapses in agony

regards the two strangers

CRITTENDEN
You’re Dick little

DICK
Liddil

CRITTENDEN

DICK

HENRY CRAIG
He’s given us a confession but so far the
newspapers haven’t caught onto it Youve
guaranteed him a conditional pardon and
amnesty for his robberies

CRITTENDEN
You’re Robert Ford

BOB grins but can’t think of anything to say

CRITTENDEN
How old are you Bob

BOB
Twenty
CRITTENDEN
Did you surrender to Sheriff Timberlake as
well

HENRY CRAIG

It was his brother Charley who was in the
James Gang We couldn’t find anything on Bob
Hes acting in the capacity of a private
detective

CRITTENDEN
I see

CRITTENDEN pours tea

CRITTENDEN
Jesse James sent me a telegram last month
saying he was going to kill me if he had to
wreck a train to do it He said that once I
was in his hands he was going to cut my heart
out and eat in strips like it was bacon

(beat)

I‘m going to wreck his train first

BOB emits a scoffing laugh CRITTENDEN glares at him

BOB
I’m sorry Your Excellency I was thinking of

something else

CRITTENDEN
Jesse James is nothing more than a public
outlaw who’s made his reputation by stealing
whatever he could and by killing whoever got
in his way Youll hear some fools say hes
getting back at Republicans and Union men for
wrongs his family suffered during the war
but his victims have scarcely ever been
selected with reference to their political
views

The GOVERNOR’S WIFE moans in the other foom CRITTENDEN tempers his
voice
CRITTENDEN
Im saying his sins will soon find him out
I’m saying his cup of iniquity is full I’m
saying Jesse James is a desperate case and
may require a desperate remedy

DICK looks to BOB to respond - but sees that the boy is overpowered by
the situation so he responds for him

DICK
Youve got the right man for the job

something else I wanted to do Or my
predicaments changed or I saw my hardships
from a different slant you know all what can
happen It never seemed respectable

JESSE trots his mount forward

JESSE
I‘1l tell you one thing that’s certain you
won’t fight dying once youve peeked over to
the other side you’1l no more want to go
back to your body than you’d want to spoon up
your own puke

JESSE vanishes again leaving CHARLEY’S motor to work in the silence

CHARLEY
(calling after him)
Since we’re looking to rob banks I was
wondering if I could go so far as to
recommend we add another feller to the gang
and sort of see if we couldnt come out of

our next job alive
JESSE in his cloud seems transfixed by his saddle stirrup

CHARLEY (OFF-SCREEN)
Bob wanted to know could he ride with us next
time we took on a savings bank or a railroad

CHARLEY continues hopefully

CHARLEY
Bob isn’t much more than a boy to most
appearances but there’s about two tons of
sand in him and hell stand with his shooter
when that‘s what’s called for And he’s smart
too - he’s about as intricate as they come

JESSE materializes suddenly vivid against the snow

JESSE
Youre forgetting that I’ve already met the
kid

CHARLEY

He surely thinks highly of you

JESSE
All America thinks highly of me

CHARLEY
Still It’s not like you‘ve got two million
names you can snatch out of a sock whenever
you need a third man I mean who else is
there that isn’t already in jail

throat BOB is incapacitated by panic JESSE is terrifying

JESSE
I’1l say ‘How come an off-scouring of
creation like you is still sucking air when
so many of mine are in coffins’

BOB’S eye lolls to the blade

JESSE
I’ll say ‘Howd you reach your twentieth
birthday without leaking out all over your
clothes’ And if I don’t like his attitude
I’1l slit that phildoodle so deep he’1l flop
on the floor like a fish

Then JESSE retracts the blade and shoves BOB rudely forward Then his
temper abruptly alters and he slaps both knees gleefully laughing at

Jesse slept with Bob in the children’s room
that night and Bob remained awake He could
See that there was a gun on the nightstand

he could imagine it’s cold nickel inside his
grip it’s two pound weight reached out and
aimed but he couldnt even maneuver toward
it it was like a name he couldnt remember

It was if some spell had rendered him meek
infirm confounded He could contrive many
ways of snaring Jesse he could invent a
thousand deaths but Bob feared it would
always come to this he would see a chance
and then he’d speculate on it’s consequences
he would ponder each option and particular
and soon the opportunity would pass away

INT KITCHEN HOUSE ON THE HILL - DAY
BOB with baited breath watches through the doorway

JESSE stands naked in a laundry boiler wringing a washcloth over his
skull He’s wracked by a coughing fit He seems old prematurely
decrepit the scars on his body stand out red as slaughter

BOB’S hand moves to the granddaddy Colt that’s strapped to his thigh
But that’s all he can’t bring himself to unsnug the weapon

After a long beat JESSE says

JESSE
Go away

BOB
It never crossed your mind that I was here
and it’s been nigh on three minutes at least

JESSE
You sure of that Maybe I was fooling you

Maybe we’re playing cat and mouse

BOB
I’ve never seen you without your guns

neither

JESSE tows a towel off a chair and reveals almost incidentally a

twelve inch Remington revolver on the seat

BOB
Isn’t no one could sneak up on Jesse James

is the way it used to be

JESSE
And now you think you know otherwise maybe

that’s just what I wanted

BOB
I’m just making fun is all you understand I
wouldn’t dream of mocking you or causing you
any 111 feelings

me or do you want to be me

Jesse was increasingly cavalier merry
moody fey unpredictable He was sick with
rheums and aches and lung congestions he
tilted against chairs and counters and walls
in cold weather he limped with a cane His
clever mind was often in conflict insomnia
stained his eye sockets like soot He
counteracted the smell of neglected teeth
with licorice and candies he browned his
graying hair with dye he camouflaged his
depressions and derangements with masquerades
of extreme cordiality courtesy and goodwill
toward others

On BOB working at keeping his expression neutral

NARRATOR (VO CONTD)

only acting the innocent in order to lull Bob
into stupid tranquility and miscalculation

You going to look inside

BOB crams a coin into the interstices and twists until the lia
releases

BOB
It’s April Fools Day you know

JESSE
It isn’t a joke

Inside the box nestled in red velvet is a pearl-handled 44 caliber
revolver BOB beams at JESSE

BOB
Such extravagance

JESSE
Doesn’t that nickel shine though

BOB
It’s more than I could hope for

BOB clicks the chamber around cocks and releases the hammer cocks the
hammer again and aims the revolver at a red ball on the floor Squeezes

the trigger

JESSE
I figured that granddaddy Colt of yours might
blow into fragments the next time you squeeze

the trigger

BOB
You might have something there

ZEE (OFF-SCREEN)
Dave You ready for supper

JESSE
Pretty soon sweetheart

BOB
I might be too excited to eat

Jesse smiles broadly and rises from the spindle chair

JESSE
You know what John Newman Edwards once wrote
about me He said I didn’t trust two men in
ten thousand and was even cautious around
them The governments sort of run me ragged
you see I’m going the long way around the
barn to say I’ve been feeling cornered and
just plain ormery of late and I’d be pleased
if you’d accept the gun as my way of
apologizing

BOB
Heaven knows Id ornerier if I were in your

position

JESSE
No I haven‘’t been acting correctly I can’t
hardly recognize myself sometimes when I’m
greased I go on journeys out of my body and
look at my red hands and my mean face and I
wonder about that man who’s gone so wrong
Why all that killing and evil behavior I’ve
been becoming a problem to myself I figure
if I can get you right I‘1l be just that much
closer to me

BOB looks at the man in bewilderment and can’t find the words for an
answer so he says

BOB
I need to wash my hands if Supper’s on The
guns made them feel sort of public

inventoried the clothes on the hangers and
hooks He sipped from the water glass on the
vanity He smelled the talcum and lilacs on
Jesse’s pillowcase He reclined on the
mattress and rolled to his left as Jesse must
have rolled to marry with his wife in the
evening His fingers skittered over his ribs
to construe the scars where Jesse was twice
shot He manufactured a middle finger that
was missing the top two knuckles

CHARLEY rolls to his back and gazes at the ceiling and then looks to

CHARLEY

calming breaths of air Quiet comes to the room again and then he says

He covers himself with a tattersall quilt from the clothesline and
settles himself on a plain bench A mangled spoon is in the dirt a
straw doll is in a tin bucket He hears the screen door creak and clap
shut and JESSE lowers onto the bench like sameone who weighs six

hundred pounds

JESSE
So you and me are the nighthawks

BOB makes no reply

JESSE
Mrs Saltzman cut out a garden patch here
The Turners say it was a marvel rabbit wire

He rapidly pounds his knees with his fists

JESSE
I’ve got pains in every inch of my body My

lose my gift of second sight

BOB
Do you see future things like they were long
gone or do you just get inklings about

JESSE shows no inclination to answer
JESSE

You know Frank and I looked for my father’s
grave over in Marysville California
BOB
You‘ve mentioned that but not at any length

JESSE
I could picture the grave and the wooden
cross but I couldnt get the geography right
They say it was cholera that killed him They
might as well’ve said the bubonic plague You
can always tell when it’s Satan’s work

BOB

JESSE
Trickery Empty promises

JESSE scratches at his jawbeard

JESSE
You missed the Palm Sunday service

BOB
I used to go every week but that was because

my daddy put a gun to my head

JESSE shuts his eyes and recites

He coughs

JESSE
‘For it was not an enemy that reproached me

then I could have borne it neither was it he
that hated me that did magnify himself
against me then I would have hid myself from

him But it was thou a man mine equal my
guide and mine acquaintance We took sweet
council together and walked unto the house
of God in company’

A good preacher will match that up with

meanly and spits
JESSE

Sometimes I get so forlorn and melancholy Do
you ever get that way

BOB shrugs

JESSE

Do you know what it is you’re most afraid of
BOB

Yes
JESSE

BOB
I’m afraid of being forgotten I’m afraid
I’1l end up living a life like everyone

way or the other

JESSE
It isn’t always up to you Bob It may not be

in the cards for ya
JESSE looks over to Kansas and leans on his knees for a minute

JESSE
Do you ever get surprised when you see
yourself in a mirror Do you ever find
yourself saying ‘Why do they call him by my
name’

It seems to BOB that JESSE expects no response

JESSE
You’re wrapped in a ragged coat for your
three score and ten and nobody gets to see
whos inside it

BOB
It’s getting chilly

JESSE
His voice is like a waterfall

BOB
Whose voice

JESSE
If I could stand in it for a second or two

all my sins would be washed away

BOB
I honestly can’t follow this conversation

JESSE smiles

JESSE
Do you know who I’m jealous of You If I
could change lives with you right now I
would

BOB
‘I guess this must be a case of the grass
always being greener

JESSE
You can go away right now if you want You
Can say ‘Jesse I‘m sorry to disappoint you
but the Good Lord didn’t put me here to rob
the Platte City Bank’ You can go inside and
get your gatherings and begin a lifetime of
grocery work I’m roped in already but
you’ve still got the vote That’s a gift Id

give plenty for
BOB grips the tattersall quilt around his neck

BOB
I don’t know Im not acting according to any

plan I’m just getting out of spots and
pressing for my best advantage

JESSE

You can’t always make things happen Bob
BOB

Well like I say I’m just taking what comes

my way
JESSE rises and crimps his fingers on the metal clothesline sagging on
it a little looking at the ground

JESSE
You Fords show your teeth like apes

The man’s gloom seems to BOB to be turning dangerous

BOB
I’m going to call it a night

JESSE slumps forward dismally making the metal hooks complain

JESSE
Why don’t you stay with me a little longer

BOB
I’m sort of sleepy Jess

JESSE
Go ahead then

BOB pauses at the screen door and turns back to him perplexed

BOB
I appreciate your frankness with me This has

thumb twitches as he lowers his hand to his gun

JESSE focuses on the picture of Skyrocket

He withdraws a furniture duster and climbs a rush-bottomed chair
BOB slinks from the wall and stands between JESSE and his two
revolvers

He shakes his fingers like a gunfighter and instructs his brother with
scared eyes

guns
