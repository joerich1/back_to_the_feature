The vast infinity of space -

ROLL CREDITS - DRIFTERS

Soon the silhouette of a PLANET fills the screen -

The sun breaks slowly across the arc of the planet -

END CREDITS -

As the light increases we see the planet is EARTH -

A TITLE reads EARTH - 2070 AD

Soon afterward the moon can be seen in the distance -

WOMANS VOICE(VO)

Ahh the space age Must have been

a thrilling time to be alive All
the hopes for a better tomorrow all
the dreams of inhabiting new worlds

Soon a SPACESHIP enters the frame - only the rear of the craft is visible at
first
as it heads into space -

WOMANS VOICE(VO)
Its amazing they even made it out
this far considering what they had
to work with Guess it really was
one giant leapa hundred years ago

Soon the side of the ship becomes more and more visible -

WOMANS VOICE(VO)
But I guess after that first leap
things just werent as exciting
How much do you need to know about
a place like the moon Its cold
silent

The camera begins to PAN the side of the ship -

WOMANS VOICE(VO)
But it sure was a beautiful place to
visit or so they said At least if
you could afford itguess it all
boils down to money in the long run -

As the camera PANS across the side of the ship we see its name - STAR
PRINCESS

written in a slick commercial

style -

WOMANS VOICE(VO)
Me I just felt lucky to be along
for the ride

INT SPACESHIP LOUNGE - NIGHT

We see DAWN MURPHY an attractive girl in her late 20s gazing out the window
of
the lounge -

Just then MAC a fully articulated human android dressed in a futuristic
concierge-like outfit approaches Dawn -

She turns to face him and his eye scans a small computerized PIN on her
jacket -
he looks up to her -

MAC
How are you this evening Dawn
Murphy

Dawn smiles at the android looks around as if a little embarrassed then
looks
back out the window -

DAWN
Im fine

MAC
Congratulations on yourrecent
award

DAWN
Thank you

MAC

Is there anything I can help
you with

DAWN
No just enjoying the view

MAC
Well theres no better to way
to see the world than with us

DAWN
So Ive been told

MAC
Well if you need anything please

reminder we have fabulous cuisine
available 24 hours in the earthrise
room and a large selection of
vintage wines here in our ship bar

Dawn then looks at Mac -

DAWN
Thank you Im fine

Mac smiles at Dawn -

MAC
Enjoy your trip with us

Mac then heads off - Dawn turns and looks at him -

We see the lounge of the ship - sleek and luxurious decorated in rich
fabrics and

material - behind the bar we see the bartender JACK a burly man in his 40s
cleaning some glasses -

Mac walks by a table where a couple is sitting - they are DELBERT MILES 49
an

overweight man with slicked back hair and a gaudy ring on his hand - across
from

him is MONICA MILES 22 a buxom somewhat bored-looking blonde brandishing
an
enormous diamond WEDDING RING -
Delbert puts down his drink and grabs Mac as he passes -

DELBERT
Hey chief

Mac stops and looks at the couple scanning the pins on their chests -

MAC
Hello Delbert and Monica Miles
Congratulations on your recent
wedding -

DELBERT
Yeah yeah look never mind all that
(shakes his drink)
let me get another one of these lots
of ice and dont be stingy with
the whiskey this time ok

Jack listens in the background to the conversation -

Mac then looks at Monica -

MAC
Certainly and anything for you
Monica

MONICA

Im fine thank you

DELBERT
Oh and bring out some more of
those little baked things and
some hot mustard

MAC
Certainly I will now process
your request and I hope youre
enjoying your trip with us

Mac walks away - Monica stares into her drink -

MONICA
I dont like him calling me by my
name it gives me the creeps

MAC
Yeah I wish hed put a sock in
it already

Delbert downs the remainder of his drink - Monica looks sullenly into her
glass -

Delbert notices this puts his drink down -

MONICA
Whats wrong baby You havent
said a whole lot lately

Delbert picks up her hand and kisses it - Monica doesnt respond -

MONICA
Im homesick

DELBERT
Homesick Its only been two
days

MONICA

We should have gone to Nassau At
least we could go swimming lie on
the beach

DELBERT
Ah hell we can always do that Listen
believe me once we get to the
moon your tone is going to change

MONICA
How is it going to be different
from this Go see some boring
footprint under glass

DELBERT
Look you were the one who wanted
to do something different something
to tell all your friends Any
chump can go to Nassau

Delbert scans the room littered with the beautiful people of the times -

DELBERT
Look around you baby were rubbing
elbows with royalty oil sheiks
this is class Youll be envied
by everyone

MONICA
I guess so

DELBERT
Besides I cant wait to tee off
on the sea of tranquillity That
should shore up that prick Hank
Drexler

Monica stares blankly back at him -
DELBERT
You know The guy at the club I

was telling you about

Monica takes a sip of her drink and puts it down -
MONICA
I still say we should have gone
to Nassau

INT SHIP BRIDGE - NIGHT

PAN an array of blinking controls and sensors - seated at the console is the
ships
first mate RYAN TAYLOR a good-looking man in his 30s examining them -

Soon the ships captain approaches CAPTAIN REYNOLDS a distinguished-looking
man
in his fifties -

REYNOLDS
Hows everything looking

TAYLOR
Finishing up the diagnostic
everything checks out normal
we still have to take a look
at the starboard suite on B
deck Weve relocated her
and she doesnt seem to be
that upset about it

Seated across the bridge second mate ALEX BARNES turns and addresses them -

BARNES
Why should she its her fault
All guests are told not to eat
in zero gravity but she just
wanted to have fun I guess
didnt realize what a grain of
salt can do to sophisticated
machinery

REYNOLDS
Well I guess she figures shes
paying for it

BARNES
Aint it the truth Must be good
to be rich

Reynolds takes a look at his watch -

REYNOLDS
All right Im headed down to
engineering If you gentlemen
need me thats where Ill be

TAYLOR
Yes sir

Reynolds leaves the room -

Barnes then gets up and stretches -
BARNES
Well I guess theres no time
like the present Ill go
run a check on that room just
to show we go that extra mile
for our guests

TAYLOR
Sounds like youve been talking
to Mac too much

Barnes heads toward the door -

BARNES
Yeah I think hes developing
a crush on me

Taylor smiles as Barnes exits - he then turns his attention to a screen -
POV he cursors down to a command - LIFE POD STATUS ENGAGE

We see him select that option -

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Two PORTERS struggle with the luggage of ANNA KOROS the thirtysomething heir
toa
shipping fortune who follows behind -

ANNA
Now look will you please be
careful with those They cost
more than you make in a year

The two porters look at each other as one unlocks the door -
Anna takes a CELLULAR phone out of her purse -

ANNA
When will my original room be
ready again

1ST PORTER
Im sure theyll notify you as
soon as theyre done maam

ANNA
Shuffling back and forth I feel
like Im traveling coach

She dials the phone from the hallway watching the two men enter the room —-
ANNA

Put them near the window
And be careful
Anna dials the phone and puts it to her ear - she then does a double take
down the
hall -

POV We see an impeccably groomed movie star handsome WARREN WAYNE exit his
neighboring suite room and lock the door -

Annas jaw drops as she slowly lowers the phone -

Wayne puts his key in his pocket and gracefully slicks his hand across his
perfectly combed hair before heading in the direction of Anna -

Anna watches him approach -
ANNA
(to herself)

Oh my God

Wayne approaches and smiles at Anna -

WAYNE
Evening

ANNA
It cant be

WAYNE
Excuse me

ANNA

Youre Warren Wayne
Warren slows down somewhat reluctantly -

WAYNE
Uh yes I am And you are

ANNA
Anna Koros
She sensually extends her hand Warren shakes it -

WAYNE

Koros

ANNA

My grandfather My God I cant

You were magnificent in Deadly
Gamble

WAYNE
Oh thank you

ANNA

WAYNE

ANNA
So what brings you out here
(Beat)
Pleasure cruise

WAYNE
Well a little business too In my
upcoming project Star Trackers I

space experience I feel it will
add more credibility to my performance

ANNA
Of course of course

WAYNE
So

ANNA
Well I guess were neighbors for
this trip

WAYNE

Well so we are
(Beat gestures
towards window)
Sure is beautiful huh

ANNA
(looking at Wayne)
It certainly is
Wayne looks at Anna and smiles -
WAYNE
Well it was nice meeting you

Enjoy the rest of the trip

ANNA
Im sure I will

Wayne heads off -
ANNA
Im sure well see each other
again
Wayne turns back and smiles -

As he turns away we see his smile vanish -

Just then the two porters exit the room -
1ST PORTER
Youre all set maam Ill
personally go and check on the
status of the old room right
now

ANNA
Youll do nothing of the kind

The two porters look at her as she heads toward the door -
ANNA
Im staying put thank you very

much

Anna then slams the door in the porters face - the two men look at each
other -

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Camera approaches Barnes as he works on some circuitry in a open PANEL in the
wall -

Quickly and methodically Barnes works with some TOOLS - he then looks up and
down

the length of the hallway before quickly taking a small METAL CASE out of his
pocket -

CLOSE on the case as he opens it - it contains a sophisticated series of
CONNECTORS

attached to a dense white CUBE of what appears to be plastic explosive
surrounded

by black metal -

INT BRIDGE - NIGHT

Taylor continues running a check of the life pods onscreen -

Just then a command comes up - FAIL MODE CONFIRMED 96

The command seems to trouble Taylor who faces the computer and enters some
commands - he pauses for a beat -

He sits back - once again FAIL MODE CONFIRMED 96

Taylor frowns at the command - he presses a button on his wrist watch -
INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Barnes begins to carefully cross-install the device in the case onto the
equipment

in the circuit panel - soon his watch beeps -

TAYLOR (VO)
Hey Barnes

Barnes stops working for a beat then answers his watch -
BARNES
Yeah go

INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
Taylor looks at the monitor -

TAYLOR
Im getting a very strange command
on the life pod status check Did
anything come up on the last
diagnostic

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Barnes seems angry at the news - he shakes his head bites his lip and
quickly
removes the few wires he has attached -

BARNES
No I just ran it Why are you
running it again

TAYLOR(VO)
Well its a good thing that I
did
INT BRIDGE - NIGHT
Taylor looks at the screen -
TAYLOR

Its telling me fail mode
confirmed Did you see this

BARNES (VO)
There must be some mistake You
sure you hit the right commands

TAYLOR
Yes Im sure I hit the right
commands
INT HALLWAY - NIGHT
BARNES

Why dont you reset and run it
again The pods check out ok

TAYLOR(VO)
Youre certain of that
BARNES

Trust me

(Beat)
Even checked em with my own
eyes

INT BRIDGE - NIGHT

TAYLOR
All right Ill give it a shot

Taylor presses the button on his watch and resets the commands -
Just then Dawn Taylor enters the bridge - Taylor turns and faces her -
The two look at each other for a beat -

DAWN
They said it would be ok to come
up here

Taylor gets up and approaches - Dawn extends her hand -

DAWN
Im Dawn Murphy

They shake hands -

TAYLOR
Oh right right youre on that
research grant

DAWN
Thats right

TAYLOR
Ryan Taylor first mate Welcome
aboard First time in space

DAWN
Yes Theoretical discoveries aside
theres nothing like the real thing
How about you

TAYLOR
This is my second commercial flight
(Beat)
I used to run satellite freighters
but that got old fast

Dawn looks around the bridge -
DAWN
So you were looking for a new

challenge

TAYLOR
Well plus the money aint that
bad

DAWN
So tell me do you think everyone
gets their million dollars worth
on this trip of a lifetime

Taylor and Dawn look at each other and smile -

TAYLOR
Well let me put it this way Most
of the cost is due to safety reasons
Most people are not familiar with
space travel so we have to take
extra precautions in the event they
do something careless

DAWN
Like open an airlock by mistake

TAYLOR
Well I dont think theres a
chance of that happening Its
usually the moon walks Sometimes
you feel like a kindergarten teacher

DAWN
(laughs)
Well I hope I dont do anything
careless

TAYLOR
Im sure youll be all right

DAWN
Actually Ive logged about 200
hours of simulated space walking
at the institute mostly related
to starship construction

TAYLOR
Really

DAWN
Still I hope I behave on the
moon

(Beat)
Ill stick close to you

TAYLOR
Well then youll have nothing to
worry about at all
(Beat)
Youre dealing with a trained
professional I guess
Dawn and Taylor smile at one another -
INT LOUNGE - NIGHT

CLOSE on the table where Delbert and Monica were sitting - the table is
strewn with

balled-up NAPKINS PEANUT SHELLS CRUMBS TOOTHPICKS SMEARED MUSTARD and
EMPTY

GLASSES -

Carlo looks at the table with disgust and shakes his head -

Jack approaches Carlo in the now desolate lounge - Carlo moves the glasses
and then

folds up the entire tablecloth -

CARLO
Look at thisJesus

JACK
Yeah I guess money dont buy
class

CARLO
No But it buys a lot of other
things

JACK

CARLO

of interesting people
Carlo holds up the tablecloth -

CARLO

stars

Carlo walks off - Jack watches him -

JACK
Hey its early yet

DISSOLVE
TO
INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Various groups of well dressed individuals sit amongst various tables in the
posh
dining room -

At one table Capt Reynolds sits with Dawn and some other guests -
Delbert Miles shoves a forkful of food in his mouth -

Just then CARLO a mild - mannered waiter in his 30s approaches Delbert
from
behind -

CARLO
More wine sir

DELBERT
Yeah

Carlo begins to carefully pour a glassful - Delbert takes the bottle out of
his
hand and proceeds to fill the glass to the brim -

DELBERT
Just leave the bottle

Carlo watches for a beat - Delbert puts the bottle down and looks at Carlo -
DELBERT
Dont worry Ill take care of
you at the end of the night

Next to Delbert Monica picks at her food - next to her a wealthy Arab OIL
BARON
peripherally ogles her cleavage -

MONICA
Oh noI think theres carrots

DELBERT

Delbert looks at Carlo -

DELBERT

CARLO

DELBERT

(chuckles)

MONICA
Go to hell

Carlo nods and walks away -

DELBERT
(laughs)
Im just kidding baby

Across the table Warren Wayne smiles as he listens to the conversation and
wipes
the corner of his mouth with his napkin -

Just then Anna appears from out of nowhere and props up a chair -
ANNA
So
Wayne looks at her as she looks him directly in the eye after having had a
few
drinks -

ANNA
What was it like doing a love
scene with Pamela Jarvis

The others listen to the conversation -

WAYNE
Well uh I just dont know what
to say
(Beat nervous laugh)
I guess theres worse ways to
make a living

MONICA
I did a love scene once for an
interactive instructional disc
The guy had BO and I told him
so Next day he wore so much
cologne I almost threw up

WAYNE
Oh Really
DELBERT
Why dont you tell them the good

side

Monica looks at Delbert then at the others -

MONICA
Thats where I met Delbert He
came down to the set then he
wanted me on more discs then he
put me in the magazine
(giggles)
Then he married me

WAYNE
Well see It wasnt so bad
after all

ANNA

I bet Pamela had nothing bad to say
about you

WAYNE
No I think hygiene is important
It helps you get into the part

ANNA
Very professional of you

Dawn sits and talks to Captain Reynolds - the conversation

the

din - just then Reynolds checks his watch and says

stands
up -

REYNOLDS
Excuse me ladies and gentlemen

is inaudible over

excuse me to Dawn - he

The people at the table turn and face Reynolds - the din gets quieter -

REYNOLDS
Could I have your attention
please

The voices die down in the room -

REYNOLDS
On behalf of myself and the crew
Id like to welcome you all aboard
the Star Princess I guarantee
this will be a trip you will
never forget

The others look at Reynolds - Delbert downs another drink -

REYNOLDS
In approximately 36 hours we will
be landing 300 yards from the very
spot where the Apollo 12 lunar
module first set down in 1969
From there you will be able to
leave the ship and be an eyewitness
to history The actual flag the
actual first footprint all carefully
preserved for you to view Its
going to be a tremendous experience
and Im glad all of you decided to
come along for the ride

Reynolds smiles at the crowd and gestures to Mac -

REYNOLDS
Now many passengers want to know
the nuts and bolts of how we carry
out the operation So for all you
technology fans Im happy to
announce we have Mac on board
Mac is our mobile automated concierge
and has been programmed to have an
encyclopedic knowledge of every detail
of the ships operations Hes here
to make you happy so feel free to
ask him anything

Mac smiles at the guests -

REYNOLDS
So once again thanks for coming
aboard and enjoy your stay on
the star princess

The sound of here here and clinking glasses is heard as Reynolds makes his
way

out the room -

Just then Delbert nuzzles up to Monica and paws her -

DELBERT
(slurring)
Im horny
Monica shoves his hands away -
MONICA

Get your hands off of me
EXT STAR PRINCESS

The ship continues its way toward the moon in the
distance -

Barnes works feverishly on the computer keyboard -

A SCREEN appears reading CREW LOCATION -

There is a list of crew members starting with the captain -

A diagram of the ship appears - Barnes highlights the captain - the diagram
indicates the captain is located in his room -

CLOSE on the PIN on Reynolds jacket hanging from a

HANGER -—

Reynolds walks over to a chair dressed in his bathrobe - he lowers himself
into the

his

uniform - he feels the pockets shakes his head -

He looks around the room and exits his quarters -

INT BRIDGE - NIGHT

CLOSE on a pair of READING GLASSES folded and lying on a counter - in the
background Barnes continues to work -

As we get closer top Barnes we see small beads of sweat on his forehead -
BARNES

A screen then appears before Barnes - it reads
BEGIN RECONFIGURATION

Barnes pauses for a beat -

BARNES
-without breaking a few eggs

Barnes then hits enter - a 60 second COUNTDOWN begins on the screen -
595857

Barnes sits back -

Suddenly the bridge door SLIDES OPEN -

Barnes SPINS his chair around -

REYNOLDS
Whats going on here

Reynolds storms over to the monitor -

REYNOLDS
What the hell is that

Barnes approaches from behind -
BARNES

Reynolds turns and looks incredulously at Barnes -

REYNOLDS

Barnes You realize how sensitive

this equipment is
Barnes nods and stares down Reynolds -

BARNES
All too well captain

REYNOLDS

it

TAYLOR

Why are you doing this

BARNES (VO)
I was getting to that Now please
dont try my patience Ryan

INT BRIDGE - NIGHT

BARNES
Now were all businessmen and a
common rule of business is to
make payment for services rendered
Given that Im willing to provide
a service to each and every one
of you
INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

BARNES (VO)
Im willing to transmit that code 3
emergency If youre lucky a rescue
team might just get to you in time
Of course by then Ill be long gone

CARLO
In exchange for what

BARNES (VO)
Well Carlo youre not really part
of the equation

INT BRIDGE - NIGHT

BARNES
But those other high rollers around

service in return for the personal
authorization codes of each and every
bank account Once I have those
codes and Ive completed the
transfer Ill signal the alarm But

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Taylor listens to this as Delbert approaches -

DELBERT

let you live And this offer is non-
negotiable

Dawn walks over to Taylor -

DAWN
It doesnt make any sense

TAYLOR
(to Barnes)
Its suicide Barnes How do you
think youre going to get away
it
ANNA
Theyll track him down ina
heartbeat

BARNES (VO)
I understand your concern but
those are my problems not yours
But for the record the transfer
trail will take them years to follow
By then it wont matter because I
wont exist at least not on paper

WARREN
Why would we give you anything
without a guarantee of our safety

BARNES (VO)
Well I guess thats just a
question of faith huh Of
course if money means more
to you than a chance at survival
Id say youre my kind of
guy

TAYLOR
Its still not going to work
Theyll detect you upon re-entry
in an emergency vessel

BARNES (VO)
Who said Ill re-enter in the pod
I got friends out in space Ryan
friends willing to get me back
unnoticed Thank God for deregulation
huh

INT BRIDGE - NIGHT

BARNES
Now I think Ive given you all
the information you need to make
a sound decision But Id advise
you to hurry

Barnes leans closer to the microphone -

BARNES
Ill give you fifteen minutes
to organize your information Ill
take any further delay as a sign
youve rejected the offer and
then of course its rescinded

Barnes then reaches over to a button -

BARNES
Over and out
Barnes then presses the button -

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Dawn approaches Taylor who inspects the sealed door -
DAWN

Taylor sees any attempt at opening the door is futile -

TAYLOR

TAYLOR

Fat chance of that Even if we
had C4 and a laser torch these
doors wouldnt budge

(Beat)
That son of a bitchthat stupid

Carlo and Dawn talk with Taylor -

DAWN
Given a malfunction how would
a rescue team get you out if
the doors wont open

TAYLOR
Probably come through the wall

DAWN
Well maybe we can do something
like that
Taylor looks at Dawn -
TAYLOR

I dont think you know what youre
talking about Besides what could
we use for tools A steak knife A

corkscrew

DAWN
Just considering our options

Dawn and Taylor look at each other -

CARLO
We couldnt try anything anyhow
He must be watching everything
we do

TAYLOR
Youre right

Taylor looks at the CONTROL PANEL next to the door -

TAYLOR
If only I could override this
thing

At the other end of the room Mac approaches Delbert who nervously lights a
cigarette -

MAC
On the behalf of the Star Princess
we apologize for any inconvenience
you might experience -

DELBERT
Get outta here will ya

Mac backs off and walks away - Monica approaches Delbert -
MONICA
Well now what are we gonna do

DELBERT

DELBERT

Nearby Jack places a TABLECLOTH over a dead guest -

DELBERT (OS)
I tell you one thing Im not
giving him shit not a password
not an access code not the time
of day

Jack turns around and looks at Delbert -
Warren and Anna approach Delbert and Monica -

ANNA
I think we should do what he
asks

Delbert looks at her incredulously -

DELBERT
Oh you do huh Well let me
tell you something lady if you

level youre nuts

WARREN
Thats a risk we cant afford
to take

DELBERT

I can Use your head do you

say what happened

Jack approaches -

WARREN
Theres a chance hell keep
his end of the bargain if we
only cooperate

DELBERT
Bullshit

Jack steps up and looks at Delbert -
JACK
Look Were talking about life
and death here I dont know

conversation

DELBERT
Well what would you know about it
You dont have anything to lose

Jack gets closer to Delbert -

JACK
Youre gonna give him those bank
codes you know why Because Im
telling you to thats why Im
not losing my life over some greedy
pig

DELBERT
Who are you calling a pig rummy

Just then Jack SHOVES Delbert violently - Delbert CHARGES Jack and they
scuffle
briefly before being separated by Warren -
WARREN
Come on Stop it Stop it

Delbert and Jack back off from one another still staring each other down -

WARREN
Lets just stay calm ok

JACK
I dont believe this crap

Mac approaches Taylor Dawn and Carlo -

MAC
I am receiving a high level
of negative feedback from our
guests comments Many expletives
at a higher than usual decibel
level

Taylor looks at Mac then approaches the others -

TAYLOR
Look people listen to me As the
first mate I know a lot about this
ship Now I dont know whats going
on outside these doors I dont know
where the captain is I dont know
whos left out here What I do know
is that if what hes saying is true
were in serious trouble So I
suggest we collect the information
he wants and give it to him

DELBERT
Thats still no guarantee of anything

TAYLOR
We dont have a choice Now lets
write them down OK

DAWN
Supposing we could get out of this
room Is there anything we could
do to reach the bridge

TAYLOR
It depends on the condition of
the ship If I could get to
one of the suit compartments
I could check the exterior air
locks for a possible entry

DAWN
Cant we access the mainframe to
check the ships condition

TAYLOR
With what How am I going to
interface with it I need to
be able to talk to the system
and to have the system talk to
me

Dawn looks at Taylor who looks down at the ground -

CARLO

Suddenly something dawns on Taylor -

TAYLOR
A way to talk to the system

Taylor then looks up at Mac -
Dawn watches Taylor -
Taylor turns to Carlo -
TAYLOR

Barnes reaches over to a button -

BARNES
Yeah yeah 10-4

Barnes disconnects the message -
He then gets up and approaches Reynolds lying dead on the ground - he stares
at

him for a beat -

He reaches into the bloody robe pocket and pulls out a
CIGAR -

He smells the cigar wets the tip and lights it -

BARNES
Shame to waste a fine corona

Taylor slowly holds up the piece of paper to the lens -

INT BRIDGE - NIGHT

CLOSE on the monitor showing the piece of paper listing the authorization
codes of

the passengers nest to their names - the list takes up the entire screen -

Taylor gestures to Carlo to come over - Carlo approaches and Taylor carefully
hands

him off the paper to hold up -

technical problem

MAC

knowledge of the ships operations

TAYLOR

Taylor looks at Macs face - Jack approaches -

Dawn begins to connect one end of the wire to the wall console -
TAYLOR
I need you to actually do something
for me I need to access your CPU
directly

MAC
That will not be necessary You can
simply speak to me I understand
most languages fluently

TAYLOR
Yeah but the ships mainframe doesnt
I need you to tell it something

MAC
Alteration of my central processing
unit should be done only by an
authorized service dealer

TAYLOR
I know but were in a bind

Mac waits a beat before saying anything -

MAC
Alteration of my central processing
unit should be done only by an
authorized service dealer

Dawn then turns and looks at Mac -

DAWN
Yes Mac but the guests are
requesting it
(Beat)
It will reduce the level of
negative feedback

MAC
That is one of my priorities

Taylor looks at Dawn -

TAYLOR
That is what I thought

Taylor and Jack look at Macs face -

TAYLOR
Now which one was it again

JACK
Its the left one I think

The camera slowly pans following the cable -
TAYLOR (OS)
Ok the first thing we need to

Taylor then gently moves the other end of the cable toward Macs face - as we
approach we see Macs LEFT EYE removed with a socket for the corresponding

cable -

TAYLOR
Here goes nothing

Taylor slowly inserts the cable into the socket -
Everyone waits for a beat -
TAYLOR
Now Mac can you tell me the status

of this deck

MAC
One moment please
(Beat)

Dawn examines the EYEBALL then looks at Taylor -

DAWN
Do you think its working

TAYLOR

Mac sits motionless with the cable hanging out of his
eye -

The others watch apprehensively -

MAC
This corridor is accessible

Taylor and Dawn sigh with relief -

TAYLOR
But the corridor outside this door
is open correct

MAC

views from there

DELBERT
Screw the damn views Get us out

Taylor and the others glare at Delbert for a beat - Taylor then continues to
focus
attention on Mac -

TAYLOR
Mac what about the suit
compartments on this level Can

MAC
(Beat)
Im sorry The suit compartments
are in a non-oxygenated zero
gravity atmosphere Im afraid
thats off limits to all passengers

Taylor sits back -
TAYLOR
Damn it If only we could get to
those suits
Dawn then thinks of something -

DAWN
Why cant we

TAYLOR
I dont know the condition of
the compartments Depending
on damage debriscould be
a fatal mistake

JACK
Unless you could hold your breath

Taylor looks at Jack -

TAYLOR
And suppose you couldnt hold
out

DAWN

Suppose you didnt have to hold
your breath

Taylor looks at Dawn -
DAWN
We could send Mac If he can
retrieve one suit we could go

back for the other

TAYLOR
Youre right

Taylor then looks at Jack - he raises his wrist -
TAYLOR
Jack let me have your walkie
Put it on channel 10
Taylor than looks around walks over to a chair and SMASHES it on the
ground
picking up one of the steel legs -

Taylor then looks at Mac -

Mac raises his hand to the PANEL on the wall -
As he does the wrist walkie gets near A LIVE WIRE jutting out of the wall -
As Mac punched in a number -

Suddenly there is a bell indicating someone trying to enter the bridge -
Barnes swings around -

He checks the monitor and sees it is Mac waiting outside the bridge door -
Barnes grabs up his gun and approaches the door -

He opens the door all the time aiming his weapon -

Mac stares at him -

BARNES
Where the hell did you come
from

MAC

Hello second mate Barnes I was
instructed to come to the bridge

Mac reels for a beat leans on the hallway wall -
MAC

BARNES

The smile fades from Barnes face -

MAC
Yes he did Yes he did
Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining

MAC

Taylor glares at Delbert -

TAYLOR
It doesnt work that way Theres
only so much oxygen only so much
fuel only so much mass it can handle

TAYLOR
If I could get to the bridge I could
send the distress signal

DAWN
Even if we do it might be too late

Taylor looks at the room -

TAYLOR
Then I have no other choice
(Beat)
I have to get to the suit

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT
Dawn and Taylor make their way down the darkened hallway strewn with debris

and
collapsed ceiling panels -
TAYLOR
Watch your step

Taylor approaches a sealed door - he looks at it for a
beat -

TAYLOR
Its through this door

Taylor then looks at Dawn -

TAYLOR
I dont know what were facing

DAWN
I understand

They look at each other for a beat -
Taylor takes a deep breath -

TAYLOR
Are you ready

Taylor nods at her - he then looks at the door -
Taylors hand approaches the emergency lock release -

Here goes nothing

Taylor hits the button -
CLOSE on the doors - they SWOOSH open -
INT SUIT COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

The pressurized room BLASTS Taylor and Dawn into the small room filled with
several large recessed LOCKERS - there is NO SOUND WHATSOEVER -

They struggle to anchor themselves as they slam around the room and come
dangerously close to a GAPING HOLE in the wall leading out to space -

Dawn grabs onto a railing for dear life her face contorting from the lack of
oxygen and the brutal cold -

Taylor RIPS OPEN one of the lockers containing a SPACE
SUIT - the door swings open and shut violently as Taylor struggles to hold on

Dawn struggles to get closer to another one of the lockers -

FROST rapidly begins to form on her hand and the railing -
Taylor slips and slams backward - but through sheer will power grabs hold of
the

locker door and pulls out the suits HELMET - he lets go and flies
backwards

holding the helmet -

He slams into Dawn and hands her the helmet - she too lets go to grab it
and is
propelled around the room -

Taylor then opens another locker and repeats the procedure this time
grabbing
another helmet -

By this time dawn has gone to the first locker and removes the suit
struggling to

get into it while keeping her bearings -

Taylor puts on the helmet and follows suit grabbing another suit out of the
second

locker -

Almost at the point of bursting Dawn begins to lock the helmet down -

Taylor continues to do the same getting the arm of the suit stuck in the
locker -

Dawn floats over to the railing - she grabs it and positions herself -

Taylor finally frees the stuck jacket and continues getting into the suit -
CLOSE on Dawn as she uses her free hand to press some commands on the other
