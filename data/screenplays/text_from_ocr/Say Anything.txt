COURT (Contd)
These days you have corporations
who own hundreds of nursing homes
and thousands of beds They buy
wheelchairs in bulk and they care
for their residents in bulk
tooand that means the poorer
patients suffer

COUNCILMAN
For example

COURT
As long as youre a private pay
resident you get a good room But
if you run out of money and switch
to a government program Medicaid
-- you may find yourself taken to
the hospital for a ‘check-up’ and
when you get backyour bed is
filled So you get switched to a
smaller room or maybe a different
home and maybe your buzzer doesnt
get answered quite as quickly Its
a nightmare its a scam and youd
be surprised at the government
agencies whove checked me out once
I started talking about this stuff

Diane admires her father who is getting through to this
bored group F

COURT
My home is a family business
feel we can add a new wing and still
provide the personal service which
I feel makes us the best This is
not a nursing home where the owner
wears a suit and lives a thousand

miles away-
