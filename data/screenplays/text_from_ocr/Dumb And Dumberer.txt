turns the second R backwards

DOCTOR VO
Youre going to need to push
harder

MRS DUNNE VO

The doctor reaches in and pulls out a tiny foot A tug-ofwar ensues
between the baby foot and the large doctor hand and it looks like the
babys winning

DOCTOR

The doctor reaches back in and pulls out another foot The feet kick
their way out of the doctors hand

DOCTOR (contd)

She hands him a rolled-up scroll Harry brightens his dream again
alive He unrolls the scroll and we see his mother has drawn a crude
map with an X marking the school

MUSICTITLES BEGIN (or) CONTINUE

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING

Exiting a door that reads CUSTODIAN CLOSET Lloyd dances along to a
fast paced rhythm He walks past the gymnasium (and a sign reading
Boys Showers)

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

LLOYD enters a door that reads Chemistry Lab

INT CHEMISTRY CLASS - MOMENTS LATER

A poster on the wall reads Chemical Shower - For Use In Case of
Contamination only And a drawing of a man pulling a chain over his
head

LLOYD still sings as he pulls the chain which starts the extremely
brief fire extinguisher-like chemical shower He pulls again and again
while soaping up He shakes himself off refreshed

INT CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER

TIGHT SHOT on napkin dispenser Lloyds hand delicately pulls one
napkin out - the last one Still singing we reveal

LLOYD his wet naked body plastered with hundreds of paper napkins hes
been using to dry himself He walks off doing an impression of a mummy

INT AUTO SHOP - MOMENTS LATER
LLOYD still covered in napkins presses a button and a massive paint
drying fan fires up All the napkins fly off him as Lloyd backs up
stepping on a FLOOR-CREEPER which rolls quickly out of frame

SFX Crash

Reveal Lloyd has landed in a spill-barrel of transmission fluid
SMASH CUT TO

INT CHEMISTRY CLASS - MOMENTS LATER Once again Lloyd showers and
shakes himself off refreshed

INT HALLWAYLOST and FOUND - MOMENTS LATER
LLOYD walks out of the closet wearing an assortment of odd clothing
RAY exits another classroom at the same time

RAY pulls out an old camera from lost and found

RAY (contd)
Let me take your picture

LLOYD

We HOLD ON Ray as he watches Lloyd run off

RAY

(to himself)

We go through this every year
He picks up and eats an old sandwich from the lost and found
EXT HIGH SCHOOL - SECONDS LATER

LLOYD rushes out the schools front doors going against the flow of
people entering Books and papers fly as he runs away from the school

LLOYD
Out of my way Cant miss my bus

Then he tears off down the street Some students look back at him
EXT SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS

HARRY with his combed hair is reading his map as he finishes the
apple

HARRY

his apple)

a friend - how does the apple work

This is distracting One of these

apple

HARRY (contd)
I sure hope Im making the right
decision
He looks at the apple again
HARRY (contd)
Now take your seeds and grow into a
beautiful pie
He tosses the apple
It lands in a yard where it hits a MEAN LOOKING DOG in the head The
dog looks up growls when he sees Harry and begins the chase in full

attack mode

HARRY hears the growling dog turns and after a swallowed cry starts
running

The dogs overly long chain unravels as he gains on Harry
EXT HIGH SCHOOL STREET - CONTINUOUS
We see Lloyd running towards camera in the opposite direction

LLOYD
Must catch bus

EXT SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS
Back on Harry as the dog is about to bite his ass
Then very quickly we see the chain stop the dog in mid-air with a yelp

just as Harry rounds the corner and SMASHES HEAD FIRST INTO LLOYD It
looks very painful as they both fall to the ground
LLOYD shakes it off and holds his mouth Harrys once combed hair is
now permanently disheveled

LLOYD
Somebody chipped my tooth

REVEAL his trademarked chipped tooth

HARRY
How do you think I feel Someone
bit me in the forehead

REVEAL the piece of tooth is stuck in his forehead Harry plucks it out
and tosses it away

LLOYD
You couldve saved that for the
tooth fairy

HARRY

attractive girls

LLOYD
High school is all about looking

EXT FLOAT BUILDING MONTAGE - DAY

We hear the theme from the A-Team re-mixed with an Eban Schletter

heating duct hands it down to Ching Chong

EXT BIG A GAS N STUFF - MOMENTS LATER
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is still on the pay-phone while Jessica sits in his

let him know they got slushees from him without having to go inside

They do a big we-have-slushees-and-wedidnt- have-to-go-inside dance

TEN YEAR-OLD KID

LLOYD
Now it makes total sense why she
didnt want him to know we were in
his office the other night

Collins starts up the car

LLOYD (contd)
Dont let him see us

HARRY and Lloyd run over to the gas pumps and try to hide by looking
nonchalant

Over the following Harry pumps gas into a side window of a car while
Lloyd actually sprays gas all over the windshield

HARRY
No wonder we both struck out with
her Who can compete with the
sexual power of the man who
occupies the highest office in the
land
LLOYD
Hes like the Pope Like were
gonna snake a girl away from the
Pope

HARRY
Hey lets go spy on them

Collins backs out of the gas station Harry and Lloyd put the gas pumps
back Lloyd jumps in a shopping cart and Harry starts pushing Cale
comes out of the store takes a drag of his cigarette and gets in his
car (the car Harry and Lloyd gassed up and in)

EXT CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

HARRY and Lloyd have wheeled after Collins when a huge explosion
erupts The gas pumps are now a ball of fire

HARRY and Lloyd stop look back and stare From above Cale flies into

HARRY and Lloyd riding Collins car through the streets They swing out
into the street and almost crash head-on into a FIRE TRUCK with a
DALMATION riding on top They turn back and watch it go away

HARRY

LLOYD
He must be on his way to pee out a
fire

Up ahead they see a MR SOFTEE ICE CREAM TRUCK with a softserve cone

INT COLLINS STUDY - CONTINUOUS

Collins is at a tape recorder looking very confused at LLOYDs
singing He presses fast forward and is annoyed when all he hears is
Lloyds rambling

LLOYD
If I may quote the twentieth
century poet
(mispronounces Piscopo)
- Joe Piscahpo
(Like Billy Crystal)
You look Marvelous

INT COLLINS LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

JESSICA

HARRY
Well Im listening now

LLOYD

of the tape

LLOYD bops along as he listens to his mix tape

JESSICA
HARRY Lloyd listen to me I only
have time to say this once
Collins is a criminal Hes
kidnapped me The evidence you
need to convict him is in that
chest Youve got to take whats
in that chest and make sure people
know about it before the parade
tomorrow and Collins and Heller get
their money and leave town

The boys hear none of this We hear their thoughts as their minds
wander

LLOYD (VO)
God shes cute Look at her teeth
I bet she could bite through
anything Yes yes she could

JESSICA sees Lloyd nodding like hes paying attention She looks at
Harry whos also nodding

HARRY (VO)
I wonder what Lloyds thinking
about

(Harry glances over at
LLOYD then back at

JESSICA)
Look at all that hair She must
have millions of tiny holes in her
head Otherwise it would just
bunch all up on her brain

JESSICA
So guys you listening to me

HARRY LLOYD

JESSICA
Remember before the parade

HARRY LLOYD
Right right The parade

HARRY
Hey look its our teacher

JESSICA

JESSICA just stares at her

HARRY sticks the tape in a player
PRINCIPAL COLLINS (0S)

Principals log September twenty

HARRY
Hey its Principal Collins

LLOYD

LLOYD
Something about showing the world

HARRY

LLOYD fast forwards a little more

PRINCIPAL COLLINS (0S)
And that is how I Principal
Collins became the mastermind
behind this glorious plan And the
Special Needs brats dont know
anything about it Its the crime
of the century

LLOYD
Hes right We have committed the
crime of the century

HARRY
What What did we do

LLOYD
We never thanked him for giving us
our Special Needs class

HARRY
(eureka)
Thats what Jessica was talking
about
LLOYD

She wants us to show the world what
a great guy Principal Collins is

HARRY
And like she said do it before the
parade

LLOYD sees the poor chalk drawing of a float on the blackboard that
Heller left

LLOYD
A float

HARRY
Thats it Build him a float for
the Thanksgiving Day parade

LLOYD startss modifying the float-sketch - its scribble

LLOYD
HARRY we found the real thing to
be thankful for Screw George

Good bye George Washington hello
PRINCIPAL COLLINS

HARRY stops him

HARRY
Wait a minute Have you ever

LLOYD starts to swing his hammer Harry stops him

HARRY

LLOYD takes a long look at Collins photo then at Washingtons head

Once again he raises his hammer to take another swing and HARRY
restrains him the two share an awkward moment
EXT SCHOOL STADIUM - NEXT MORNING

Collins sees the police coming from the other direction so he turns
around and starts running back - towards the float

HARRY (contd)

HARRY waves at Jessica dropping the hydraulic rod connected to the
pirate hook Just then Collins runs by and gets caught up on the

Yeah we should never let a woman
come between us again

LLOYD

They hear a loud honk turn to see a COOL 4 SEATER SPORTS CAR with TWO
HOT IDENTICAL TWIN GIRLS in matching sexy outfits

HARRYs upper body gets soaked in the MUDDY POO-LIKE COATING LLOYD
peeks out from behind muddy Harry

LLOYD (contd)

face

HARRY starts to reply when he is HIT BY A CAR Knocked out of frame

HARRY screaming - seen through the windshield of the car that hit him
The car comes to a rapid stop as Harry holds on to the windshield
