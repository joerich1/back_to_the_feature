SHOOTING DRAFT

FADE IN

CASTLE - NIGHT

Now comes the moon riding over the horizon Upon a hill
the edge of the wood squats a castle its crude

bathed in cold silvery light Queer carvings and runes
decorate the ponderous gate Heavy vines are climbing

walls The castle is old its unfamiliar form testament
an ancient mind and an ancient craft Flickering candle
dances on a leaded windowpane

Inside the corridors are dark and silent Under low

ceilings the uneven floors are paved with stone blocks
Perched over lintels and crouched in niches are icons

strange animal heads

HODGE

A sleep on a straw palette in a room strewn with
and crockery is Hodge a wrinkled old retainer A

candle and empty jug are beside the bed He is snoring

CONJURING ROOM

from a

iron candelabra stands on a work table tapers burning
the soft glow it seems that the room is unoccupied but
moving in the background is a shadowy figure preparing

a magical deed Feet are positioned carefully within a
pentagram chiseled into the floor A scroll is

comes an arm and a voice blurts out
VOICE
Omnia in duos Duo in Unum Unus in
Nihil Haec nec Quattuor nec Omnia
nec Duo nec Unus nec Nihil Sunt

Nothing happens

VOICE
Come on candles out

But the little flames stand at attention without so
a tremble
VOICE

In Volunta Divina et Verbum Magi

Lux Exstinguat
Its no use There is a sigh and the figure moves
into the light Revealed in the glow is the discouraged
of Galen Bradwardyn sorcerers apprentice
TOWER
Carrying the candelabra the youth trudges up a
staircase
TURRET
The highest point of the castle is a turret open to
stars and the night air Here more magic is afoot An
enchanter Ulrich Magister Ipsissimus pours water

silver ewer into a stone bowl As the surface ripples
disappear he leans forward and gazes into the pool All
once his face hardens as the distant sounds of screams
and

thunder reach his ears Lights and shadows reflected
from

within the basin play across his face His frown
deepens as

the sound of his own voice comes to him from the vision

in
the water -- Draco draconis -- suddenly squelched by
the
roar of flame and an ugly snarl
At that moment Galen reaches the top of the steps and
holds
up the candelabra
GALEN
Vide Magister Theres something
wrong
Ulrich startled from his trance slaps the water out
of the
basin and turns to confront his student Galen is taken
aback
by the old mans grim countenance
GALEN
Whats the matter Whats happened
ULRICH
Ive just seen something Something
of consequence to you
GALEN
To me
ULRICH
(calm)
Yes My own death
With a distracted gesture he causes the flames to
extinguish
themselves
ULRICH
Perhaps we had better hasten your
training

Outside the castle wall Hodge is feeding the chickens
ducks He straightens up and squints through the early
mists On a distant hillock two figures are moving

the woods

ULRICH AND GALEN

Hobbling slowly with the aid of a pair of canes Ulrich
his pupil across a wooden bridge and along a stream
forest

ULRICH

(stern and troubled)
This wood these leaves the birds
the very dome of heaven once they
all rang with one great chord and
philosophers like me kept it all in
tune Now new voices are singing
new songs

(sharply)
Have you mastered the threefold
transmutation

GALEN
Of course

ULRICH
(skeptical)
You have
GALEN

Well almost

ULRICH
Its very difficult Have you
committed to memory undying the Codex
de Profundis

GALEN
(a shrug)
The first two chapters

ULRICH
Its long And what about the Ritual
of Banishment as prescribed by my
late master Balisarius
GALEN
To tell the truth I havent dared
try it Whats the point anyway

ULRICH
The point The point is you dont
know it and youre no magician
without it It was my hope to school
you to mold your faculties and
wits I still believe you have
some talent Somewhere

GALEN
hate books I hate drill I want a
real task

ULRICH

Theres no time now When Im gone
half the powers in the universe will
vanish with me And whats the use
of a few lingering skills if theyre
left in the hands of a child

(pause)
Listen

GALEN
dont hear anything

Ulrich gauges the young man standing before him and

makes a
decision Reaching under his cloak he lifts off a fine
silver
chain with an amulet dangling from it He drapes it
around
Galens neck
ULRICH
Here wear this
Galen instinctively wraps his hand around the jewel He
cocks
an ear
GALEN
Voices singing on the road
He hastens forward to a promontory eager to have a
look

Ulrich does not follow Instead doffing his cloak he
whirls

glumly at

it before him where it magically floats a few feet off
ground Awkwardly the old man clambers aboard

GALEN
I dont see anything

He turns back but the wizard is gone A shadow falls
him He looks up There two hundred feet above the
tops his master is soaring on the wind

AIRBORNE

The old conjurer squints into the distance Miles away
far below a company of drab walkers winds along the

of the forest They are singing a mournful round
GALEN

He gawks skyward Suddenly the old man leans down and
addresses him

ULRICH

(a shout)
We have visitors

ROTUNDA - NIGHT

Clustering together in the center of a wide reception
is a contingent of weary peasants awkward amidst the
rugs drapes and heavy furniture Their leader is a
youth not yet twenty Like the others he is uneasy
name is Valerian Hodge enters and sets a tray of mead
them He leaves without a word The visitors stare

the refreshment but are too timorous to go near it

CONJURING ROOM
Galen helps Ulrich prepare for the audience The
sorcerer

peers at himself in a full-length mirror adjusting the
hem

of a black robe

ULRICH
Looks forbidding enough dont you
think

GALEN
Here are your sticks

ULRICH

No -- theyll think me infirm You
now Balisarius wore this whenever
he changed lead into gold He could
really do that you know I never
could Too bad -- youd stand to
inherit some real wealth

GALEN
Youre in a morbid frame of mind
Whats all this about dying You
dont even look sick

ULRICH
(tying on a sash)
You still wearing that amulet
(Galen nods)
Good Dont lose it It still belongs
to me

He backs away from the mirror and fits a silver coronet
onto
his head

ULRICH
Now adeptus minor get yourself a
handful of that sulphurous ash over
there

The sorcerer starts down a circular stone staircase
THE ROTUNDA

The visitors watch warily as a door swings open and
Galen

makes his entrance his face expressionless and hands
pressed

together He looks rather young to be the famous
Ulrich
Galen allows a moment to go by then throws his arms

wide
Ka-whump and Ulrich appears in the doorway in a smoky
fireball Alarmed the visitors retreat
ULRICH
Nunc habeus lux
Pffst around the room candles flare in their niches
ULRICH
Et calor
In the fireplace the birch logs are suddenly ablaze
Ulrich
totters to the hearth and extends long bony fingers
toward
the warmth
ULRICH
Welcome to Cragganmore I am Ulrich
Which one of you calls himself
Valerian
The travelers are suitably dazzled by the magicians
performance The young leader of the party screws up
his

courage and speaks

VALERIAN
That would be me We are here on
behalf

ULRICH

I know why youre here Youre a
delegation from Urland from beyond
Dalvatia Lets see the artifacts

The travelers exchange nervous glances Valerian
motions to

one of his companions The man steps forward and hands
over

a leather pouch One by one Valerian places the
contents on

the table for Ulrichs inspection

VALERIAN
A bone Scorched A rock fire-
blackened
(pause)

Scales
At this Ulrich advances and closely examines three

shimmering
irridescent disks as big as saucers
ULRICH
All right How did you come by these
VALERIAN
(proudly)
I found them At the mouth of the
lair
ULRICH
(grim)
What else
Valerian reaches under his jerkin and withdraws what
appears
to be a curved sword He jabs it into the table
VALERIAN
A claw
ULRICH
Thats no claw Its a tooth By the
gods
He runs a finger along a serrated edge and gazes
bleakly at

his visitors

ULRICH

And you want me to do battle with
that

Valerian has lost all trace of timidity

VALERIAN

Who else can we turn to We all know
what were dealing with here This
is a basilicok

(he takes a step

forward)
A cockatrice

(another step bolder)
A dragon

(he leans close to

Ulrich)
This is no stag no bear no natural
creature This is one of your kind
And only a necromancer such as
yourself can rid us of it

ULRICH
Did you try the Meredydd sisters
What about Rinbod Ive heard it
said he killed a dragon once

VALERIAN
Theyre all dead Youre the only
one left

With a sigh Ulrich lowers himself into a chair He
rubs his
withered legs and shakes his head

ULRICH
Its a long way to Urland

VALERIAN
Every quarter upon the solstices
and the equinoxes theres a new
victim

Greil a grizzled peasant speaks up

GREIL
My daughter for one

OTHER TRAVELERS
My sister cousins

ULRICH
All women

VALERIAN
Girls Virgins to be exact chosen
by lot

Galen edges over to the table and inspects the scales

and
tooth

GALEN
Master dont you think --

ULRICH
Silence

He broods for a long time

VALERIAN
Are you afraid of dragons
ULRICH
No Sorcerers and dragons go back a
long long time together If it werent
for sorcerers there wouldnt be any
dragons
(pause)
All right Ill go

CuT TO
COURTYARD - DAY

The travelers are making ready for departure in the
grey

light of dawn As Hodge stuffs provisions into a wicker
box

Ulrich wraps padding on a newly fashioned pair of
crutches

ULRICH

I know of this dragon Vermithrax
Pejorative shes four hundred years
old As far as I can tell shes the
last of her kind Very appropriate
that Im the one to finish her off
dont you think

(he tries out the

crutches)
There Flatten the highest mountain
What say you Galen

(no answer)
Speak up

(still no answer)
You Hodge

Hodge mutters something inaudible and grimly keeps
packing

ULRICH
(to Galen)
While Im gone see you keep your
nose in your books and your hands
out of my reagents Leave my
instruments alone too

Galen crouches against the castle wall he regards his
master
sullenly
Look at yourself How far will you
get like that A league two leagues

ULRICH
Im not worried about the road

GALEN
(sarcastic)
Why dont you wave your hands around
and summon up a coach-and-four

ULRICH
Dont mock me

Galen gets up and calls out to the Urlanders

GALEN
You pilgrims Youre used to
lotteries Why not draw straws to
see wholl be first to carry
ironshanks here

This is too much for Hodge

HODGE
Hold your tongue If the masters
got a mind to go hell go

Galen approaches the old sorcerer

GALEN
Send me Youre always saying I need
seasoning I need a test Let me go

ULRICH
Youre not ready

GALEN
Im ready for anything

ULRICH
(wan smile)
Dont be so hasty Your time will
come

The walkers are ready to set forth Hodge picks up his
pack
steps forward and pulls open the great gate

HORSEMEN

Three mounted men are outside the gate helmets on

heads swords on the belts and longbows across their
shoulders They look formidable The Urlanders take a

VALERIAN
Tyrian

Tyrian is a lean heavily bearded nobleman There is a
of arms on the shield strapped to the pommel of his
TYRIAN

(amiable)
Good morning all

VALERIAN
Were not afraid of you Give us the
road

TYRIAN

Why the road is yours All the way
to Urland Its a long journey isnt
it But when youre in search of a
sorcerer I suppose no distance is
too great

Sensing trouble Galen moves forward Ulrich touches
arm

ULRICH
(under his breath)
Say nothing

Galen hears the urgency in the old mans voice and
Hodge takes it upon himself to deal with the strangers

HODGE
What do you want with us

TYRIAN
Well like my good friends here
Ive come for a bit of black magic
No doubt youve heard of our troubles
at home This is Cragganmore is it
not
HODGE
Aye this be the place of Ulrich

Tyrian dismounts and saunters up to the old magician

TYRIAN
And here we have the mystical presence
himself no

HODGE
Youd best keep your distance -- and
your manners

TYRIAN

If hes ready to lay a dragon in its
grave hes got nothing to fear from
me

(turns to the Urlanders)
Ive no more love for that creature
than you lot Nor has the King But
before you stir things up dont you
think it a good idea to see youve
got the right man for the job

HODGE
Aha -- its a test youre looking
for We dont do tests

TYRIAN
Im sure you dont They never do
tests -- and not many real deeds

either Oh conversation with your
grandmothers shade in a darkened
room the odd love potion or two
but comes a doubter well then its
the wrong day the planets are not
aligned the entrails arent
favorable we dont do tests

VALERIAN
Weve got no doubts We require no
test

HODGE

And youre not going to get one

When Ulrich finally speaks his voice is low and
authoritative

Tyrian

ULRICH
You shall have your test

CONJURING ROOM
Galen comes puffing up the steps locates the iron box

flings it open Amidst the tawdry paraphernalia of a
professional magician is an ivory-handled dagger

with runic inscriptions Galen eagerly examines it to
how the blade might twist aside or collapse into the
but it is all too genuine A murder weapon
ULRICHS VOICE
(impatient)
Where are you boy Im waiting
Galen throws open a window and looks down into the

He displays the dagger

GALEN
Not this one was it

ULRICH
The very one Let it fall

Galen hesitates then tosses it Tumbling end over end
arcs downward The old conjurer calmly stretches out a
and plucks it neatly out of the air Galen watches as
passes the weapon to Tyrian and strips back his robe

a bony chest Galen knows whats coming He rushes for
door Hes only a step away when it bangs shut of its

own
accord He sprints for a second exit Whack This door
slams
shut too Locked in Quick back to the window and
climb
down the vine Smack the heavy shutters seal him in
ULRICH AND TYRIAN
Ulrich takes Tyrians arm and guides the point of the
dagger
to his breastbone
ULRICH
Vita regula vita hieratica
Everyone is filled with dread Hodge is shaking From
the
castle come the rattling of shutters and Galens
muffled
cries A sick sarcastic smile has crept over Tyrians
lips
He tenses himself to thrust
ULRICH
Go on Dont worry you cant hurt
me
CONJURING ROOM
Galen stops hammering and presses his face to a crack
in the
shutter Below he can see the participants in this
grisly
drama He holds his breath Tyrian makes a sudden
movement
and buries the blade in Ulrichs chest But the
sorcerer
stands unbent seemingly unhurt Then after a long
moment
he slowly sags forward over the dagger and the hand
that
holds it Tyrian shrinks back and allows the body to
fall in
a heap Very quickly he remounts In another moment he
and
his companions are gone The others are riveted in
horror

FUNERAL PYRE - DAY

Ulrich principal magician and sorcerer of the western
reposes on a hardwood pyre His hands are folded on his
His face is peaceful While the visitors wordlessly
Galen touches a burning brand to the kindling At first
fire catches normally enough but when the flames start
envelop the body they suddenly turn pale green
unearthly roar The onlookers back away from the

heat

GALEN

The erstwhile apprentice stands his ground blinking

tears his face weirdly illuminated by the fire

CONJURING ROOM - DAY
Galen sits alone amidst the museum-like collection of

apparatus He stares at the amulet considering its
significance His reverie is interrupted by the murmur

voices below At the window he looks down to see Hodge
farewell to the delegation from Urland Valerian is the

COURTYARD

Hodge is up on the burned out funeral pyre anxiously
ashes and small bones into a leather pouch -- the
Ulrich Up behind him comes Galen now clad ina

cloak with a pack on his back and a staff in his hand

GALEN
Hodge -- what are you doing

Hodge quickly conceals the pouch
HODGE
Just making my farewell thank you
very much
He quickly climbs down picks up his pack and follows

out through the gate As the door is pushed shut a huge

timber falls into place barring the castle against the
uninvited

HILLTOP - DAY

Galen and Hodge labor to the crest of a grassy hill and
to look back across a wide valley There on another

on the far side sits Cragganmore lit by the red rays

setting sun Galen removes the amulet from his neck and
clutches it in his fist Hodge is bug-eyed to see it
stretch

HODGE
Be careful with that You dont know

GALEN
Stand back

He raises his hands toward the castle and calls out

GALEN
Cragganmore Domus non i am Silva

CRAGGANMORE

The vines on the castle walls begin to twitch and
magically brought to animate life They flow upward
masonry branching out and covering every surface then
onto the roof Finally only the tops of the chimneys
highest turrets stand above the green carpet A

growth in a matter of seconds

GALEN and HODGE

On their hilltop the old retainer gives the youth a
look Galen is too flushed with excitement over what he

done to notice

FOREST PATH - DAY
Galen and Hodge trudge along an overgrown cart-track
an arch of trees

HODGE
Oh its a vale of tears in which we
dwell It doesnt matter who you
are a king in his robes a peasant
in his rags when your time comes
no magic can save you
GALEN
I guess

The apprentices mind is elsewhere hes got a coin
hovering
in mid-air above his palm bobbing gently as he walks

HODGE

the kindest lord a man could ask
for now hes gone Ye gods he was
fussy about his bath And youd think
he could boil his own eggs with the
snap of a finger but no he had old
Hodge do it of course

(snurfling)
Up before five I was mucking out
the cages slopping the pigs and
never once got so much as a thankyou
or a pat on the back

(through tears)
Im going to miss him

GALEN
Me too

He plucks a low-hanging leaf waves a hand over it and
watches it turn into a spray of daffodils

HODGE
No you dont All you care about is
the tricks and knavery Well you
dont pull any wool over these old
eyes Itll be a mighty long walk
before you fill his shoes you mark
my word

GALEN
Whats the matter Hodge pack too
heavy Here

He gives the pack a slap It flies out of its harness
and

floats alongside them Hodge snatches it back and
clutches

it tightly

HODGE
Careful with that

GALEN
Too cold is it
A great coat drapes itself over Hodges shoulders

HODGE
Stop it

Too warm

The greatcoat disappears as do the rest of his
garments

leaving him in his smalls

HODGE
(spluttering)
Stop it I say Out of respect for
the master

Suppressing a grin Galen mercifully waves his hand and
restores Hodge to his usual costume

GALEN

Ive got as much respect for the
master as anyone old man But --
then again Im master now

TRAVELERS CAMP - NIGHT

The Urlanders are gathered around a fire sharing a
meager

supper The man named Greil pokes at the stew-pot

GREIL
I left my farm with seeds unplanted
calves unborn nothing but a wife to
chase down the strays and for what
A funeral thats what

He walks up and down behind Valerian

GREIL
Because some people said find a
magician Not just a local fellow
an import a good forty leagues from
home An all-powerful necromancer
Ha -- some necromancer

Malkin an older man speaks up

MALKIN
Hold your tongue Greil Sit Eat

GREIL
Tll not sit Ill not eat See you
the Great Bear His tail points east
Its the equinox Have you forgotten
Or rather not think about it

VALERIAN
(miserable)
Hes right I brought us here for
nothing May the gods help whoevers
daughter it is tonight

There is a noise from the darkness beyond the campfire

Two
of the men get to their feet and listen At first
silence
then more rustling Without a word the two men dart
into the
bushes and haul two interlopers before the company
Galen
and Hodge
HODGE
Good morrow good morrow Peace be
with you
GALEN

Easy now We mean no harm Weve
been looking for you

GREIL
(growl)
Well youve found us

GALEN
(brushing himself off)
More the other way around Id say

VALERIAN
What do you want

GALEN
A few words thats all You were
looking for a conjurer

VALERIAN
Hes dead

GALEN
Right Requiscat in pace
and

eyes

are

Valerian

(he takes a deep breath)
Ecce magister novus

GREIL
How say you

Galen surveys the puzzled faces He draws himself up

plunges in

GALEN

My lord Ulrich is no longer All

that you asked of him you may now
expect of me The dangers he would
face I will now conquer The task

he would undertake I will now fulfill
I am Galen Bradwardyn inheritor of

Ulrichs craft and knowledge
am the Sorcerer you seek

There is a moment of depressed silence
Greil starts to chuckle then to laugh
laughing too

GREIL

and I

Hodge rolls his

Soon the others

Well thats a handsome thought O
wizard of wizards But if theres

one thing our friend Tyrian has shown
us its to beware the pig in the

poke Whos got a dagger

HODGE
No tests

GREIL
Call it proof then

Someone brings out a dagger and hands it to Greil

pushes it away

VALERIAN
Weve seen enough tests

But Greil persists waving the knife at the group

GREIL

Well I havent All Ive seen is

death Death in our families

death

on the road and tonight death at
home

He lashes out with the knife Galen jumps back but

Valerian
steps in delivering a quick kick to Greils gut
followed
by a right to the jaw that sends the bigger man
sprawling
He takes the knife
VALERIAN
Whats come over you anyway Have
you lost your wits
He propels Galen out of harms way and sits him down on
the
other side of the fire Greil nurses his jaw
GREIL
I dont like it Young snot-nose
comes in here for sport at our
expense Were on a fools errand
but we dont have to listen to this
I dont want to hear any more about
sorcery I dont want to hear any
more about spells
Valerian hands Galen a plate of food
VALERIAN
You must be hungry
GALEN
(nods)
Whats the matter with him
VALERIAN
Its not just him Its all of us
Its the equinox
They both look up at the moon
CUT TO
DRAGON COUNTRY - NIGHT
The moon shines down on the far reaches of the Kingdom
of

Urland coldly lighting a barren landscape filled with
the
skeletons of dead trees blackened rock and bare

ground

Advancing across this mournful terrain is a troop of
armed

men leading a blindfolded horse and tumbril The horse
is

skittish Finally in spite of shouts and lashings it
refuses

to go further The leader Horsrik barks out an order

HORSRIK
Close enough Bring her out

A young woman no more than seventeen is brought forth

from

the cart Long black hair falls down over a white
tunic Her

dark eyes dart fearfully around in her pale face She
is

half-carried half dragged to the edge of a steaming
crack

in the ground where she is manacled to a wooden post
By

lantern-light Horsrik reads from a parchment scroll

HORSRIK
Now be it known throughout the
kingdom that this maiden having
lawfully been chosen by a deed of
fortune and destiny shall hereby
give up her life for the greater
good of Urland

There is a low rumble the earth shakes Horsrik
glances
nervously around He carries on by rote

HORSRIK

By this act shall be satisfied the
powers that dwell underground and
the spirits that attend thereto In
gratitude for this sacrifice His
Majesty has declared the family --
whats the name --

He prods the girl but she is too terrified to speak
Beneath

them the earth seems to groan Smoke issues from the
mouth

of the pit One of the nervous witnesses leans forward

RETAINER
Plowman The family Plowman

THE GIRL
She strains against her manacles cocking her head to
as the rumblings below subside Presently the steam and

hundred yards distant the wheel of the cart jammed
rocks Summoning up a wild will to live she squeezes
hands against the cold iron rings No use She spits on

wrists and twists desperately Blood starts One hand

blindfold and looks back at her Now she strains again

pulls her other hand free She wipes the blood on her

Tyrian wipes his mouth unhurriedly and strolls over to

Far below half hidden by trees the little company of
Urlanders winds its way through the forest

A frown creeps over Tyrians face

Hodge marches along with the rest When hes sure no

out

the leather pouch containing Ulrichs ashes Reassured
that

its still with him he tucks it away again Galen
falls

into step

GALEN

HODGE
None of your business

GALEN

HODGE

Galen walks down to the edge of the pool to retrieve

be a reflection in the water Tyrian on horseback He

Malkin Greil and Valerian rush up behind him their
drawn with worry

GREIL
Look you dont have to do this We
know youre a fine young magician
None better Theres no need to prove

GALEN
Are there other entrances

VALERIAN
No Ones enough

GREIL
Come on The roads this way Well

GALEN

GREIL

Dont be a fool Come away now and

Instead Galen starts into the crack Greil and Malkin
away but Valerian lingers watching in mounting

as Galen probes further and further into the lair She
up a fistful of stones and throws them at him

VALERIAN
Go ahead Youre going to die What
a fine trick that will be

But Galen is lost in the gloom She flees

Galen puts his hand on the rugged wall the rocks are

hot to

Galen staggers out of the fissure coughing and gagging

The territory has been drastically transformed the

VILLAGE - DAY

infant and
carrying on about the Bishop of Rome

SIMON

VALERIAN

MONK

Brother Jacopus strides back and forth before the
assembly
in an inspired state

BROTHER JACOPUS
The man who walks with Christ is not
aman to fear a dragon Yea though
I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death I will fear no evil
You say you are preyed upon by a
foul beast Yes but what is the
nature of this beast It comes to
you on bats wings and clawed feet
does it not It breathes fire does
it not And it lives under ground
This is no dragon This is Lucifer

VOICE
Whoever it is hes dead

This is Galen who has just stepped into the hall
tattered
bedraggled and triumphant

BROTHER JACOPUS
Nay brother It is not as easy as
that Allegiance to Christ to be
sure but also prayer and confession
These are the arms by which Satan
may be put down

GALEN
Youre talking about superstition

She pulls out a long simple frock goes to a crude

and holds it up against her body to gauge the effect
father comes up behind her He is angry and frightened

SIMON
Put that away What if you were seen

VALERIAN
Im going to be seen I want to be
seen Tonight the world finds out
that you never had a son

SIMON
No you mustnt do that Its too
soon Weve got to think about this
weve got to make a plan

VALERIAN
Father the danger is over

He sits on the bed and puts his head in his hands

SIMON
I know What am I going to say to my
friends who still mourn for their
lost girls

VALERIAN
Youll say you did what you had to
This is a time for celebration --
and forgiveness

like having a daughter

bolt for home But Galen takes her by the hand and
conspicuous politesse leads her to the dance
DANCE
Its forward back and around sixth-century style the
sorcerer cant take his eyes off his partner But shes
shy to return his gaze
GALEN

Looks like youve been up to a little

sorcery yourself
Valerian doesnt know what to say

GALEN
Or is it witchcraft

She still doesnt reply Its all she can do to keep on
dancing

GALEN
Whats the matter A real woman never
stops talking

I begrudge nothing But I wonder at
what we have seen and how it was

You were there

GREIL

King himself has already heard it
And like yourselves tonight hes

MALKIN
What would you have of us then

TYRIAN

Not a thing Its this one

(he gestures toward

Galen)
The King would meet our new benefactor
and offer his gratitude to the man
who succeeded where so many have
failed

GALEN
(sobering up)
What sort of gratitude A knife in
the belly An arrow in the back

Tyrians smile freezes on his face He steps in front
Galen towering over him

TYRIAN
My young friend Id as soon dispatch
you as I did the others and for the
same reason But his Majesty would
like a cozy chat and commands
otherwise

turn them into toads It should be
easy thats what they are

Tyrian regards her coolly taking in her change of

There is

GALEN
One of the best things about the
water here in Urland is that theres
so much of it -- look at that

Water continues to pour into the goblet without
Galen takes a sip
GALEN
Mmm Good But not cold enough
Perhaps I could borrow a scarf from
his Majesty

The King makes no sign Galen approaches stiffly takes

scarf and retreats

GALEN
I cover the goblet so remove
so and behold winter in a mug

And hes done it he turns the goblet over and a small
of ice hits the floor The royal reaction is equally
Galen is bombing and he knows it
GALEN

All right How many of you have ever

seen a table fly
He mutters an incantation In the audience Tyrian
that Galen has his hand wrapped around the amulet
a loud clatter as the heavy oak table before the throne
to jitter and buck As the wine spills and plates go

the King wearily raises a hand

KING
Enough Thats fine

GALEN
Wait itll rise now

KING
Dont bother Not necessary

The table cracks in half and dumps a mess of fruit and
crockery at the onlookers feet

KING
Tell me the landslide -- it was
accomplished this same way

GALEN
Yes

KING
I see And having rendered such unique
service to our kingdom what would
you claim as a reward

GALEN
Please -- no payment I have always
found magical practice to be its own
reward I seek only some yet greater
challenge

This handsome sentiment doesnt go over any better than
his
tricks

KING

Did you ever hear of King Gaiseric
Of course not you werent even born
He was my brother a great King and
a valiant man-at-arms When he
ascended to the throne the dragon
was unbridled No one knew where it
might strike next So he brought
forth his broadsword and his spear
assembled a company of his best
fighters and went out to do battle

(pause)
He was never seen again But his
attack provoked the most terrible
reprisals whole villages incinerated
entire crops burned Death famine

Tyrian sweeps in with his men The doors slam shut
KING
So much for your magic So much for
your sorcery
Galen is trapped Just as Tyrian reaches for the
reins the animal rears up rolling its eyes At that

men at arms go down like ten pins Tyrian reels back

stone blocks loosened from the ceiling As the shaking
continues a weakened section of wall gives way Galen

VALERIAN

Where have you been Doesnt matter --

Then get the animals back Theyre

GALEN
I cant do it

VALERIAN

What Why not

Galens hand moves up to where the amulet used to hang

GALEN
I just cant

VALERIAN
But youre a sorcerer

GALEN
Im no sorcerer Whatever power I
might have had its gone

VALERIAN
It cant be

For a moment Valerian is too stunned to speak Then

VALERIAN
Youre sorry Listen to that The

Galen sinks to the floor and sits in the ashes

VALERIAN
You didnt have the faintest idea

a fool -- and Im a bigger one for
bringing you here

She snatches up a pitchfork and glowers at him
VALERIAN
I dont want you in this house Get

But Galen still sits there like a puppet with its

sight

touches Valerians heart Her gaze softens She slowly

TOWN SQUARE - DAY

A knot of villagers lead Tyrian and his henchmen across
the

square directly to the blacksmiths shop The Kings
men

dismount and pound on the door It swings open
Valerian is
standing there

TYRIAN
Where is he

VALERIAN
Not here I cant help you

A cry goes up from the villagers They know damn well
hes
in there
VALERIANS HOUSE

Tyrian pushes Valerian aside and steps into the room

Aided

by some townfolk his men proceed to ransack the
premises

overturning barrels sticking their swords through
flour

sacks poking through the tumbledown thatch Valerians
eye

falls on Malkin who has involved himself in the
search

VALERIAN
You too
MALKIN
(returning her look)
Damn right

Finding nothing the group pushes into the metal shop
where

Simon is hammering an iron wheel rim back into shape on
an

enormous anvil He lays down his tools and grimly
watches

the men go through overturning benches and tables
Tyrian

props a leg up on the anvil and addresses himself to
Simon

TYRIAN
As the proud new father of an eligible
daughter who was some-how overlooked
all these years it may interest you
to know that the King has called for
a new lottery

SIMON
But its months til the solstice

TYRIAN
In view of whats happened we all
know whats required

SIMON
Ive never taken part in your cursed
lottery and Ill have nothing to do
with it now

TYRIAN
You were very clever But shell
take part like all the rest No
exceptions

The search party has exhausted the rooms hiding
places

HENCHMAN
Nothing If he was here hes gone
now

Tyrian nods and leads the way out Simon catches up and
pulls
Tyrian aside at the door

SIMON
All right I know what you want How
much

TYRIAN
Are you offering me a bribe

SIMON
Yes

TYRIAN
Dont waste your time
(pause)
You could never afford it

He spins on his heel and joins his men as they ride out
of

town Valerian and Simon watch them go When the riders
are

out of sight they return to the shop With a couple of
stout

poles they strain to lift the anvil off its base
Finally

it topples over Valerian slides the base aside
revealing a

trap door She raises it and a cramped Galen unfolds

himself
from the space below On his face is a curious look of
determination

testing and rejecting them in turn

GALEN
These are your sharpest

Simon plucks up one of the swords carries it to the
of the room He lays a horseshoe on the anvil He
sword down -- whack -- and cuts the horseshoe in half

SIMON
Even Tyrian carries one of these

Galen hefts it dubiously
GALEN
Its sharp -- but its not sharp

Valerian has been watching all this with growing

Simon gnaws his lip Reluctantly he brings a long box
the bottom of the cabinet He opens it Lying on a bed
silk is an exquisite two-handed broadsword The flat
gleams like a mirror Galen reaches in and lifts it

SIMON
The best I ever made
Valerian is as awed as Galen

VALERIAN
Its beautiful

Galen brings up a finger to test the edge Simon grabs
his
hand away

SIMON

Dont do that

Girl-child when you were born I
knew I had to do something so I set
about the task of fashioning an
extraordinary weapon I had the skill
to make it --

(bleak pause)
-- but not the nerve to use it

She looks at him with affection Leaning forward she
plants
a kiss on his bald pate

slowly they go by the sword some of them very close
Finally one of them floats against the leading edge of

blade and without a ripple is cleft in two Simon gives
a significant look
VALERIAN
I dont care It doesnt matter
What you want to kill isnt flesh

Oh itll bleed all right

How do you know No ones so much as

KINGS CASTLE - NIGHT

Carrying torches to light their way families -- some
maiden daughters -- gather from all over the country in
courtyard of the Kings castle Simon is there with

and so is Galen disguised in rough farm clothes anda
brimmed hat Like many others he carries a stick

topped

with a bleached skull -- to all appearances just
another

participant in this weird pagan ritual A barrel
decorated

with flames and dragons wings sits on a raised dais in
front

of the main entrance Horsrik the Kings herald
supervises

preparations for the lottery Armed guards appear

carrying a
sealed chest Horsrik breaks the seal and the guards

pour
the contents -- hundreds of wooden tiles each bearing
the
name of a potential sacrifice -- into the barrel
Trumpets

dragons head and stirs up the names This done a new

Bare the arm Bare the arm

At a signal a guard comes forward and cuts the sleeve

Horsriks right arm He holds it high The crowd surges

Valerian looking pale and determined is jostled and
to the edge of the platform

CROWD
Draw the name Draw the name

The moment has come Down goes Horsriks arm and up it
holding one little wooden square one young womans
expectant hush falls over the mob The virgins of

By now Horsrik is trembling He stares down at the
mouth set in a grim line The King is getting annoyed
gestures and the crowd falls silent

KING
Read the name

HORSRIK
(mastering himself)
The name is Princess Elspeth Ulfilas
filia regis
There is a moment of profound shock Then a low murmur
wonder moves through the crowd Galen looks at
sags with relief The King turns to his daughter She
nothing He rises from his chair comes forward and
the tile from Horsrik
KING
Thats not the name Its been

misread

Valerian will not stand for such hypocrisy

VALERIAN
Theres no mistake The names been
chosen -- let it stand

KING
No the good Horsrik has misspoke

himself

(he looks at the tile)
In fairness to this individual whose
name I cant make out well destroy
this tile
He quickly tosses the wood chip into a brazier at his

elbow
Led by Valerian the crowd cries out in protest
VALERIAN
No What better name than your own
kin At last we see justice done
KING
Silence We will have a new choosing
I will draw the name myself
He reaches into the barrel and extracts another tile
He
looks at it and his eyes widen Betrayed he swivels to
face
his daughter The din of the crowd reaches a crescendo
CROWD
Let it stand Let it stand
Elspeth takes the tile from her fathers nerveless
fingers
looks at it with satisfaction and holds it aloft
ELSPETH
The name is as you heard it and as
Horsrik read it Elspeth
The King moils through the tiles finding his
daughters
name again and again
KING
The lottery is invalid Another and
another What treachery is this
Valerian chanting with the rest falls silent She
looks at

Elspeth with sudden interest and respect then awe

ELSPETH

Hear me good people It is true
that my name appears on many of the
lots This does not falsify the
drawing it certifies it I have

to a chest flings it open and starts rummaging

CASTLE CORRIDOR

Galen can hear the voices in the courtyard as he rushes
a hall Suddenly he stops short There in front of him
guard leaning out a window to watch the proceedings
hovers on the verge of panic as the guard abruptly

But the man is only headed for another window and a
view Galen manages to fall into step an arms length
him and slip by without a sound

Galen enters the library his enormous shadow dancing
on the torchlit walls Hurrying through his attention
drawn to some open books on a table Closer inspection

DRAGON COUNTRY - DAY

Clouds scud low over the lifeless region The dragons
now has a newer bigger entrance Vapors drift upward
it Down the slope a lonely figure works its way from

to rock its Valerian with a wicker basket on her arm
searching for dragon scales The basket is already more

half full when she finds herself ominously near the

the cavern Shes about to turn back when she spies a
particularly large and beautiful scale just a few yards
further on As she reaches for it there is a sudden
She jerks her hand back and freezes There in the

a baby dragon a basilisk all coppery bronze with
winglets As she backs away she sees two more come up

join the first They watch her retreat through wicked

green eyes

STREAM - DAY

On the mossy bank Galen and Simon unwrap the reforged
Now the blade carries a faint blue halation Galen

the middle of the current and once again stabs the tip
into the sand Then he rejoins Simon onshore to await
This time as the oak leaves approach the sharp edge
gently but definitely veer sideways to avoid contact
is the power of the sword that even after many leaves
single one has come close enough to be sliced Simon is

and even Galen seems satisfied They clasp hands
SIMON
An edge like no other on this earth

GALEN
Well done Simon Thank you

Simon hands him a bundle of fighting equipment

SIMON
(grave)
Ill say goodbye to Valerian for
you Im sorry shes not here but
you know how she is

GALEN
I understand

They look at each other for what could be the last
time

SIMON
Fare thee well

The old man departs Galen unfolds the bundle and
brings out
its contents mail hauberk with coif studded leather

gloves

padded jerkin a scabbard and a small wooden shield He
lays

them out on the stream bank then strips off his tunic
and

kneels down to splash some water in his face As the
cups

shimmers

on the surface Valerian stripping off her own
clothes

shyly turning toward him solemn and romantic

VALERIAN
Galen

Its as if the vision is speaking to him but its not

He

spins around and sees her standing there fully
clothed and
possessed of a brisk and businesslike air

VALERIAN
Here
She throws down a shield Its remarkable in its
construction --
overlapping layers of iridescent dragon scales have

been
ingeniously fastened to a leather-clad frame

VALERIAN
Its a shield I made it Might keep
the fire off you Might not You
know youre an idiot Youre going
to die tonight Youll be ripped
limb from limb This is the last
time Ill ever speak to you

Galen turns the shield over and over marveling at it

He
fixes her with a piercing look

GALEN

VERMITHRAX

Hes halfway across when the earth rumbles and the
stones teeter beneath his feet A fiery wave washes
legs leaving his boots smoking Another tremor knocks
to his knees As he scrabbles to pick up his sword and
the great head of Vermithrax rises up out of the depths
its long neck It gazes at him through huge pale eyes
armored lids A tongue flicks out and runs around its
mouth The head sways from side to side The mouth
open the nostril-like igniters come on and touch off
jet of gas squeezed up out of its innards A roaring
flame engulfs Galen He crouches behind his dragon
shield which deflects the fire just enough to save his
The dragon pauses to take a breath Galen springs to

At that moment Galen leaps out from behind a niche in

of his sword slides across the dragons plated cheek
stabs deep between the scales of its heavy neck There
unearthly shriek and the creature flicks its head back
upward Galen goes sprawling and finds himself holding

a sword The rest is buried in the beasts neck and
Vermithrax doesnt like it It flings its head this way

DAWN

Valerian roams the rock-strewn slope not far from the
lair Presently she comes upon a once-familiar object -
fire shield Half the scales are gone the rest are

and curling Grimly she moves on A few paces away she
up the blunted sword She scans the rocks and finally
what shes looking for

We have to leave Urland

Not because of what happened I

You said you loved me Is it true
If it is its the only good weve
done Lets not lose that too

He seems miles away She turns aside on the verge of

Simon is standing there still holding the sword hilt

Galen has come to a halt in the middle of the path

Hes

staring into the middle distance with a sudden
inspiration

bubbling in his brain He flings off his sack drops to

back

baffled Galens gear is strewn all over the trail

What are you doing
Galen comes up with what hes looking for -- the
leather
sack When he replies it is not to her but to Ulrich

GALEN
You old trickster The burning water

He regards her with astonishment

GALEN
He had it planned He knew this was
going to happen

VALERIAN

reluctantly
than he let it go he takes it back

brings the rock down with all his might There isa
flash as it shatters into a million fragments
