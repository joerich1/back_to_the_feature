A young woman scurries into the bank holding a newspaper
over her

head Shes soaking wet and pauses in the foyer to
straighten

herself out

Charlie immediately notices her

Stanley follows his gaze

STANLEYS POV
water out

CAMERA does a classic CHEESECAKE TILT-UP starting with the
womans million dollar legs as she squeezes some of the

of her

skirt up past her body which through her damp summer
clothes

is undeniable proof that there is a God up up to
her

face as that

newspaper is tossed aside Shes a heart-stopping
womanchild

with a Cupids bow mouth and ice blue eyes In other words
shes

trouble
Big trouble also known as TINA CARLYLE

Charlie may as well have just seen the Virgin of Guadalupe

CHARLIE

(hushed reverence)

Oh my god A perfect dime The
dame of dames The Moby of my
dick

STANLEY
Easy Charlie Youll sprain your
eyes

Tina now enters and walks towards Stanley and Charlie

TINA
Excuse me where can I open a new
account

Charlie flashes his best 100 watt smile

CHARLIE

Youve come to the right place
maam Just step right this way
and pull up a chair

Charlie tries to steer Tina to his desk but shes still
preoccupied with her damp clothing

TINA
Oh Im sorry Im a complete
wreck Will you hold this please

She hands her shoulder bag to Stanley and peels off her wet
blazer creating another awe-inspiring visual moment

CHARLIE
Here let me take that for you
Charlie clutches her jacket with white knuckles

TINA
Thanks

But Tina turns and sits at Stanleys desk Charlie is
stunned at
his near miss but theres not a thing he can do about it

STANLEY

Tina notices a box of Kleenex on Stanleys desk

TINA

STANLEY
Oh of course

Tina takes out a compact and daintily blots the moisture
from her
face

TINA

As I was saying about that tie Its
like one of those what do you

call them ink blot tests

STANLEY
A Rorschach test

She twists open a tube of lip gloss andbegins to run it
across
her incredibly lush liips

TINA

Thats it It looks like um
A young woman riding bareback
You know like a Lady Godiva or
something

STANLEY
Really I dont think I can

She slowly runs a finger along Stanleys tie

TINA

Or if thats not a horse it
could be two lovers A man and
a woman That would be the woman
on top of course

STANLEY
(MESMERIZED)
Of course

She licks her lips and blots them on the Kleenex leaving a
perfect kiss impression and drops it on Stanleys desk

TINA
What do you see Mr Ipkiss

Stanley starts to get uncomfortable under her gaze

STANLEY

I dont know Bold colors

powerful

TINA

STANLEY

Stanley shakes his head in disgust some lifesaver

Stanley inspects the Mask more closely strange ritualistic
symbols carved into a puckish face with a leering grin and

empty eye holes

The faintest sound of a haunting Mask SFX Theme rises as
Stanley turns the Mask around and inspects the inside

Stanley tosses Deaths Head 1 the Mask

He briefly inspects the funky looking antique still slick
with

See I only wanted the time Heh

All the punkers laugh like the half-wits they are as Deaths

to 3 and
so on Stanley is roughly bounced back and forth more and

violently within the circle of giggling street toughs He

breaks free and
scrambles to his front door still reeling with dizziness

fumbles with the key and SLAMS the door behind him as the

Heads roar with
laughter

CUT TO

Stanleys wet shoes SQUEAK as he tiptoes past -

A sign that reads Quiet Please hangs from the doorknob
continues past it to Apartment B Just as he removes his

THE
Managers door flies open and MRS PEENMAN appears Shes an

dragon in hair curlers who will probably live forever just

spite her

MRS PEENMAN

Reflexively he looks at his (now empty) wrist
STANLEY
Actually no

MRS PEENMAN

building laughing it up with your
pals Then you come in and start

Stanley battered bruised and soaking wet is deep in urban
shell-shock

STANLEY
(SOFTLY)

MRS PEENMAN
-Yes

STANLEY

Mrs Peenman SLAMS her door
INT STANLEYS APARTMENT - CONTINUES

Small full of books but very neat A few cherished

locks

the door behind

him - hes greeted by MILO a happy little terrie sized mutt
with

a big heart

STANLEY

Hello Milo

starts to strip off his shoes and socks

MILO

enters holding a Frisbee in his mouth

STANLEY (CONT )

Okay okay One throw

Stanley tosses the Frisbee into the air The disk sails
OUT OF THE BEDROOM AND INTO THE HALLWAY

Milo runs it down leaps up and makes a perfect catch He

back to the bedroom and drops it in Stanleys lap

STANLEY
Easy This is the best part

On the screen a cartoon dog Z2ZZIPS into frame and drops a
frizzing stick of dynamite down a bad guys pants KA-BOOM

dog LAUGHS
maniacally

Suddenly there is a POUNDING on the wall that rattles

framed cartoon cels

STANLEY (CONT )

(calls out)

Sorry Mrs Peenman

With a sigh he ejects the tape and a much quieter talk show

on Larry King and a guest

Stanley rises and crosses into the bathroom to wash up
as he

A

ANGLE ON TV
Kings guest Dr Arthur Neuman is replying to a caller

DR NEUMAN

Thats correct The truth is we
all wear masks metaphorically
speaking We repress the Id
our darkest desires and hide
behind a more socially acceptable
image of ourselves in order to
cope with the frustrations of our
day to day lives

Stanleys only half listening though the open bathroom door
brushes his teeth

STANLEY
Think Im repressed Milo

Stanley tries a couple of fierce expressions in the bathroom
mirror his mouth foaming with toothpaste

Milo does that doggie-head-cocked-sideways What the hell
STANLEY (CONT )

(HALF-HEARTEDLY)

Nah

He spits and rinses

Stanley studies the old mask then his own face in the
Everythings status quo It must have been his imagination

STANLEY (CONT )

He puts the Mask on again - firmly this time Milo dives

AN INCREDIBLE METAMORPHOSIS BEGINS

RUBBERY WOODEN WHIPS shoot out of the Mask and wrap around
Stanleys head - locking the Mask in place

STANLEYS PAJAMAS magically reweave themselves growing in

HIS HEAD THROBS AND EXPANDS turning lime green as it unites

bony and beaked

darkened corridor The floor makes a barely audible CREEEEK

Suddenly - and unexplicably - a ringing ALARM CLOCK leaps
StanleyMasks pocket and starts jittering down the hall

STANLEY MASK
O jeepers--—

StanleyMask tries to snag the clock but it bounces away
time Frustrated he pulls a full sized SLEDGEHAMMER from
pocket and

starts POUNDING the floor in an effort to stop the clock

Glancing blows shatter the clock face and most of the works

those bells just keep
ringing

The hammer of course slams craters the size of manhole

into the floor and reverberates through the building like
THUNDERBOLTS

The door bursts open and Mrs Peenmans angry face pops out
covered in blue mud pack and framed in curlers She gets one

at the Mask

with his oversized carnival mallet raised over his head and
SCREAMS bloody murder

The Mask SCREAMS in response his eyes bugging out on stalks
his mouth expanding to the size of a tuba in mock horror
Mrs Peenmans door SLAMS shut and reopens a beat later as
appears cocking an enormous shotgun

The Mask starts ricocheting off the walls HOOTING maniacal
laughter as Mrs Peenman lets loose with both barrels KA-
The Mask bounces off walls as Mrs Peenman continues to

StanleyMask whirls about with a flourish and pulls two
gleaming
mufflers from the wall

MASK
Sounds like you have a little
exhaust problem there

Theres a mad gleam in his eyes as he spins the mufflers
like two

KELLAWAY

A green head the size of a
pumpkin purple zoot suit and

As the mask flies out into the sir a sudden wind kicks up
The mask arcs back toward the building like a boomerang and
balanced precariously on a narrow ledge Its mocking grin

with triumph

CUT TO

The place looks like its been hit by cartoon graffiti
guerrillas Everythings printed in polka-dots checks

Ripley Auto Finishing sign hangs askew over the doorway
Letters have been sprayed out to read Rip Off

Several REPORTERS and curious ONLOOKERS stand nearby as

Irv out of the building on two gurneys

Theyre both in severe discomfort and look more like cars

men Bodies spray painted metallic colors hood ornaments

to their
foreheads wire rims under each limb and gleaming four foot
long
mufflers sticking out of their rear ends

They wince in pain at each tiny bump of the gurney

THE MASK

Through his bedroom window propped up on the fourth story
Its leering grin seems to beckon Stanley as we begin to hear
POUNDING beat of the Mask FX theme

STANLEY

stands transfixed staring at the moonlit face He can

hear echos of faint whispered VOICES calling his name A

siren song above
the pounding drums

STANLEY

shimmers as the WHISPERS grow louder

STANLEY

takes a last look at the crumpled picture of Tina in his

and climbs out
over the ledge

THE LEDGE

Stanley wavers precariously on the crumbling masonry then
catches his balance His face is bathed in sweat as he gazes

the leering face
FX music THUNDERS in his head
THE MASK

Stanley Stanley

Stanley tries to steady himself his eyes transfixed on his
prize

STANLEY
Just one last time

He lurches back out and makes his way one shaky step at a
time
towards the mask

MILO
watches from the apratment window whimpering softly

Narrow masonry begins to crumble
STANLEY

carefully reaches down his fingers just brushing the mask
as he

teeters out over nothingness Night traffic whizzes by down

SCREAMS as he begins to fall jamming the mask to his face

Suddenly a huge cartoon AUDIENCE pops up silhouetted in the
foreground applauding wildly An off-camera ARM shoots into

frame handing
the Mask an Oscar

The Mask leaps to his feet and starts taking bows

with

THEIR

guns drawn

retrieves it

His men begin to tear the club apart
