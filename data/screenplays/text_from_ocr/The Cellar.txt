The Cellar

DARKNESS

And then --

A GUNNED ENGINE --

BLURRED HEADLIGHTS flash across the screen --
TIRES SQUEAL on asphalt --

A split second of unnerving silence and --
CRAAASSSSH

Lightning quick CLOSE UP snippets of --
GLASS SHATTERING --

METAL BENDING and RIPPING --

A VEHICLE coming to rest --

A TIRE SPINNING upside down --

SMASH CUT TO

BLACK

And SILENCE

The soft rhythmic HUM of a distant generator fades in
Followed by a deep pained BREATH

A dim light flickers then steadies revealing a --

POV SHOT

But everything is out of focus -- blurred shades of grey
The light fades as consciousness slips away replaced again
by --

DARKNESS

The generator continues its rhythmic HUM

A slow FADE IN --

DIM FLUORESCENT LIGHT illuminates --
A SMALL ROOM

A young woman lies on a sheet-less mattress on the floor A
thin blanket covers her body Her eyes remain closed

This is MICHELLE BURKE Classic Mid-Westerner --
attractive and smart with a slight edge that does little to
mask her deep-rooted wholesomeness

But right now she’s bandaged bruised and barely conscious
Somewhere nearby -- the MUFFLED THUMP of a closing door
Michelle’s EYES SNAP OPEN -- glassy but aware

She touches her temple and winces Her fingers come away
tinged with blood from the soaked-through gauze that’s taped
to her forehead

Her eyes adjust Take in her surroundings --

Low ceiling Unpainted cinder block walls Cement floor No
windows A closed door

She turns her head causing her to MOAN

And -- seemingly in response to her moan -- there’s a
SHUFFLING SOUND on the other side of the door

Michelle goes silent

She waits listens -- but the shuffling sound doesn’t return
Her eyes flit around the room as her confusion builds

She peels back the blanket --

Shes in her underwear and there’s a makeshift brace wrapped
around her knee Her shirt is crusted with blood and torn at

the collar Confusion quickly turns to panic

She moves to swing her legs off the mattress but searing pain
stops her She grabs the brace struggles not to cry out

Her jeans sit in a crumpled pile next to the bed

Keeping her leg steady she reaches out and pulls them toward
her A shaky hand digs her cell phone from a pocket

She ignores the display telling her she has new texts She
punches 911 -- but there’s no signal

She holds up the phone moves it around -- still nothing
Michelle starts to sob Stops Takes a deep breath and --
Rolls off the bed Gritted teeth muffle her agony

She drags herself toward the door

A lone TWO-BY-FOUR rests against the wall She uses it to
haul herself up onto her good foot shock and adrenaline help

her fight through the pain

Steadying herself on the wooden crutch she turns the door
handle It doesn’t budge -- the bolt is locked

Michelle looks around the room for another escape
And then --

FOOTSTEPS on the other side of the door Getting LOUDER with
each step Growing CLOSER with each step

She hops to the side of the door grips the two-by-four like
a baseball bat and waits

The bolt lock slides --

The handle turns --

The door CREAKS open --

A foot steps into the room --
Michelle swings for the fences --

The two-by-four smashes into a mans shoulder A tray of food
flies through the air as the man tumbles to the ground

Well come to know the man as HOWARD STAMMLER (40s) but
right now hes batting practice

Michelle lifts the wood Howard raises his hands

HOWARD
Wait Stop

Michelle slams down the two-by-four with all she’s got
Howard’s forearm absorbs the brutal blow

HOWARD (CONTD)
Just listen to me for a sec

Michelle swings again for his head this time
Howard rolls out of the way The two-by-four splinters
against the cement floor He reaches back latches onto the
wood and jerks it from her hands

Michelle chokes back panicked sobs as she hops toward the
open door Her knee cracks against the frame She cries out
in pure agony collapses hard to the floor

Blood seeps from under her bandages

Howard gets up his body blocking the doorway He towers over
Michelle the two-by-four gripped tightly

He stares down at her -- breathing hard -- his expression
somewhere between surprise and anger

HOWARD (CONTD)
I’m only trying to help you

Michelle frantically crawls away from him her bad leg
dragging limply behind

Howard steps after her

MICHELLE
Stay away from me

Michelle struggles onto her good foot SCREAMS from the pain
She hops toward a shovel that rests against the back wall

Howard drops the two-by-four

HOWARD
I’m not going to hurt you

Michelle hops faster stumbles falls Her busted knee hits
the floor She blacks out from the excruciating pain

Howard stands over her for a beat Then he walks to the back
of the room and grabs the shovel that rests against the wall

INT SMALL BEDROOM - LATER

Michelles eyes slowly open Shes back on the mattress the
thin blanket covering her again

A tray of food sits on the floor next to the bed The two-by-
four and shovel are gone

Howard sits on a folding chair by the door his forearm is
now wrapped with a bandage where she hit him with the wood
She peers at him through the dim light Is he sleeping She
props herself up

His voice cuts through the darkness startling her --

HOWARD
You should eat the eggs You’ll be
dreaming of fresh food before long

Michelle looks at the tray of food then back to Howard --
detachment in his voice intelligence in his weary eyes A
combination that makes him hard to read

HOWARD (CONTD)
In a couple of weeks everythings
going to be from a can

Panic sets in again Michelle grabs her cell Holds it up

MICHELLE
I called the police Theyll be
here any minute Let me go now
Youll be in a lot less trouble

Michelle shoots him a defiant look
Howard shakes his head --

HOWARD
Youve got no idea what happened
do you

Michelle lowers her cell but doesn’t respond

HOWARD (CONTD)
There was an attack last night
Some kind of bomb exploded The
city’s destroyed

Michelle looks at Howard like he’s a lunatic

MICHELLE
Yeah Right

HOWARD
I was rushing back here when I came
across your wrecked car I couldn’t
just leave you there

MICHELLE
If you’re such a good samaritan why
the hell am I locked in this room
HOWARD

I spent all night setting your leg
and closing that wound on your
head I needed some sleep and
didnt want you wandering off

(rubs his bandaged arm)
Or cracking my head open with a
shovel

MICHELLE
You really think Im stupid enough
to fall for this

HOWARD
I think youre smart enough to know
that if I was gonna do something I
would have done it already

MICHELLE
How do I know you didnt I woke up
in my underwear with no idea where
I am or how I got here Thats
pretty fucking disturbing

HOWARD
I’m a doctor I had to take off
your jeans to set your knee

MICHELLE
I want out of here Now

HOWARD
You can’t leave The entire
countryside is blanketed with
with some sort of poisonous
chemical

MICHELLE
Youre out of your mind

HOWARD
You go outside you die But this
place has a filtration system It
should protect us from whatever is
floating in the air out there

MICHELLE
Whats gonna protect me from you

Howard shakes his head knows hes not going to convince her
of anything right now He stands up

Michelle pulls the blanket tighter around her neck
HOWARD
You need to rest
(pointing at the tray)
Thats Ketamine in the small cup
It’ll help with the pain I
recommend you take it but Ill
leave that up to you

MICHELLE
Special K We going clubbing

HOWARD
Im a veterinarian Its the
strongest painkiller I have

MICHELLE
Thought you said you were a doctor

HOWARD
A veterinarian is a doctor

He points to her leg as he tries for a little levity

HOWARD (CONTD)
Hey Consider yourself lucky If
you were a horse I would’ve had to
put you down

Michelle’s not laughing

MICHELLE
Thanks Doc But I’m not taking a
date rape drug while being held
prisoner

He takes a step toward her and there’s a tiny shift in
Howard something stirs beneath his calm exterior --

HOWARD
If I wanted to drug you I wouldve
crushed it up in your food or hid
it in your drink Or shot you up
with it while you were already
unconscious And then I could’ve
done what ever I wanted

Michelle looks sick to her stomach Howard takes a deep
breath knows he went too far

HOWARD (CONTD)
This is a lot to take in For both
of us You need to eat and you need
to sleep

(MORE)
HOWARD (CONTD)
There will be plenty of time to
talk when youre feeling better

Michelle pulls the tray onto her mattress and starts picking
at the eggs She’s not convinced of Howards story but
realizes that either way shes fucked

HOWARD (CONTD)
Call me if you need anything Ill
be right outside

That doesnt make her feel any better He exits the room
leaving the door open behind him Michelle waits a beat

She sets the food tray back on the floor
Her hand lingers grabs the butter knife

She tries to pull herself up but her weight shifts to her
busted knee The pain is excruciating

Michelle grits her teeth falls back onto the mattress eyes
watering She can’t take it She grabs the Ketamine off the
tray and drinks it

She tucks the butter knife under her pillow and passes out

INT HOUSE PARTY —- BASEMENT — NIGHT —- (FLASHBACK)

(Note All of the flashbacks are grainy and high contrast --
its hard to tell whether we are watching history a memory
or something altogether different)

Dozens of college students drink from plastic cups and bounce
to hip hop music in the basement of an off-campus house

In a back corner Michelle stands across from PATRICK Despite the raging party going on around them the
expressions on their faces say that theyre not having fun

PATRICK
Laurens in my lit class We were
just studying

MICHELLE
It took you ten minutes to close
your books and come downstairs

PATRICK
I didnt hear you knock I didnt
even know you were coming
MICHELLE
I wanted to surprise you God Im
such an idiot

Michelle takes a long drink from her cup

PATRICK
Nothing happened

MICHELLE
I saw the way she looked at you
the way she looked at me
She locks eyes with Patrick daring him to lie
PATRICK
Okay She kissed me But I didnt

kiss her back

MICHELLE
What the hell does that even mean

PATRICK
It means you can trust me

MICHELLE
Trust you Why So you can hurt me

PATRICK
Michelle I love you

MICHELLE
Yeah You got a fucked up way of
showing it

Michelle chugs the rest of her beer throws the empty cup at
Patrick and charges for the stairs

He chases after her

PATRICK
You cant go You need to sober up

Michelle pushes through the crowd of bodies ignoring him

INT SMALL BEDROOM

Michelle wakes up The fluorescent bulb is off but a bit of
light bleeds through the open door along with some noise --
HAMMERING and SANDING It puts an anxious look on her face

The food tray is gone She reaches under her pillow The
butter knife is gone too A folded t-shirt and women’s
drawstring athletic shorts sit on the floor next to her cell

Michelle reaches over grabs her cell and opens up her texts -
- all six from Patrick The last one at 242 am -- “Sorry
had to end this way I wish we could be 2gether 4ever”

Is he referring to the attack She shakes the thought from
her head

Michelle swaps her torn blood-crusted blouse for the t-
shirt It’s skintight but it’s clean She then gingerly pulls
the shorts on over her wounded knee

Michelle looks around the empty room She calls out --
MICHELLE

Hey Doc These luxury

accommodations come with a

bathroom
Howard enters carrying crutches made out of some nailed
together pieces of wood -- there’s material wrapped around
the tops sanded hand grips and duct taped feet at the
bottom They’re rudimentary but nonetheless impressive
He sets the crutches down by her mattress

HOWARD
My name’s Howard

Michelle doesn’t say anything as she pulls herself up onto
the crutches Howard reaches for her arm to steady her

She instinctively pulls away from his touch

He gets the message turns and leads the way out of the room

INT MAIN ROOM

Michelle enters the cramped living area It’s windowless with
the same low ceilings and cinder block walls

Her eyes dart around studying every square inch --

In the middle there’s a small table with two folding chairs
To her right theres a kitchenette alongside a cupboard

Next to the cupboard an open door leads to another room

To her left a worn couch blocks a set of stairs that
disappear up into darkness

And on the far side of the room theres a fully stocked

floor-to-ceiling wine rack that takes up the entire wall but

for one corner where theres a closed steel door with a
deadbolt above the handle

Howard leads Michelle through the main living area into --

HOWARD’S ROOM

A mattress on the floor A small chest of drawers against a
wall In the back two shower curtains come together to
square off the corner

Howard pulls one of the curtains aside to reveal a toilet a

sink a small mirror and a tub

Michelle crutches by him

INT BATHROOM
Howard lets the curtain go but stands right outside

MICHELLE
Yeah um a little privacy Doc

Howard heads toward the door

HOWARD
Let me know if you need any help

MICHELLE
You can help by closing the door on
your way out

Through the slit in the shower curtain Michelle watches
Howard exit He closes the bedroom door behind him

Michelle quickly crutches into --

HOWARD’S ROOM

She hobbles to the chest of drawers and starts rooting

through them The top drawer is filled with women’s clothes

The second drawer down contains men’s clothes

Michelle opens the third drawer revealing a cornucopia of
pharmaceuticals including the Ketamine antibiotics and a
few syringes

Michelle grabs a syringe As she lifts it she notices a
collection of old survival magazines underneath --

A headline on the cover of one of them catches her eye --
“HOW TO MAKE A WEAPON OUT OF ANYTHING”

HOWARD (0S)
You okay in there Michelle

Michelle startles at hearing her name She drops the syringe
and shuts the drawer Hobbles over and opens the door

Howard all but tumbles into the room having had his ear
against the door

Michelle tamps down her surprise and makes her way around him
back into the --
MAIN ROOM

Leaning on her crutches she opens the cupboard Every square
inch is taken up with canned goods and dried foods

Michelle turns to Howard

MICHELLE
How do you know my name

HOWARD
I looked in your purse saw your
drivers license

She works her way to the back corner She tries the steel
door next to the wine rack The deadbolt is locked

Howard watches her but doesnt say anything

Michelle takes a seat on the couch cranes her head to look
up the stairwell but she cant see where it ends

She tries to act calm and confident --

MICHELLE
Okay So where the hell are we

HOWARD
Near Kenosha 40 miles outside of
Milwaukee Underneath my farmhouse
MICHELLE
(looking at the wine rack)
Where you just happen to have a
fully stocked dungeon

HOWARD
I converted this cellar into a
fallout shelter right after 911
The electricity comes from solar
panels mounted on the barn roof
Water’s piped in from a well
underneath the house then it goes
through a reverse osmosis filter
Completely self contained

Howard leans against the table

HOWARD (CONTD)
Started to think I went a little
overboard but figured even if it
never serves its purpose it makes
a decent wine cellar

MICHELLE
How were you able to figure out
what happened The TV and radio
would have stopped broadcasting the
instant the bomb went off

HOWARD
The ones from Milwaukee did But I
was able to pick up a station from
Chicago until that cut out too
But it was enough info to know I
needed to get here quick

Michelle loses a bit of confidence

MICHELLE
You saying Chicago was hit

HOWARD
All I know is that they’re not
broadcasting anymore

MICHELLE
That’s where I’m from That’s where
my mom is I need to call her I
need to make sure she’s okay

The look on Howards face says that she’s probably not

Michelle tears up Howard’s not sure what to do what to say

HOWARD
I have a daughter in Washington
DC I don’t know if anything
happened there But I mean it’s
Washington DC

He fights back his own emotions

HOWARD (CONTD)
Never should have let her go

MICHELLE
We need to go outside Find a cell
signal Figure out what happened

Howard comes over reaches out to comfort her

HOWARD
I’m sorry I know it’s hard but I
can’t let --

She suddenly swings her crutch --

MICHELLE
Get the hell away from me you
lying son of a bitch

Michelle struggles to her feet backs against a wall She
keeps Howard at bay with her crutch

MICHELLE (CONTD)
Youre full of shit There was no
attack You’re just a sick pervert
trying to keep me down here

Howard looks at her his face a blank slate And then -- a
flash of anger He pulls the couch away from the stairs

HOWARD
You want to see what’s out there
(motioning toward stairs)
Go ahead
Howard keeps his distance as Michelle cautiously crutches her
way to the steps struggles to climb them
INT STAIRWELL - EVENING

Michelle arrives at the top of the stairs and finds a thick
lead door with a small 4x6 inch window

Howard comes halfway up the stairs behind Michelle

HOWARD
Have a look

Michelle leans in and stares out the window --

MICHELLE’S POV - EVENING

Late afternoon Faint sunlight A thin strip of the outside
world is visible along the top of the exterior stairwell --

Sunlight kicks off the front end of a dented pickup which
barely sticks out from behind the corner of a rundown barn

Outside the barn there’s a fenced in pen occupied by --

TWO DEAD PIGS But not just dead -- their skin is completely
gone -- peeled sliced or melted away All that remains are
two huge blobs of blood-stained muscle and fat

INT TOP OF STAIRS - EVENING
Michelle pulls away Terror pulses through her body

HOWARD
Believe me now

Howard climbs the stairs as Michelle tries to get her
panicked breathing under control

HOWARD (CONTD)
Mildred and Frank They seemed fine
when we got here I looked out a
few hours later That’s what I saw

MICHELLE
What happened to them

HOWARD
I don’t know

Howard flips a switch on a kluged together piece of
electronic equipment by the door A steady CLICKING SOUND
emanates from the machine as the meter fluctuates slightly

HOWARD (CONTD)
This is a Geiger counter

A wire runs from the device to a wand Howard threads the
wand through a small hole in the door The clicking speeds up
and the meter moves but only a little

HOWARD (CONTD)
Definitely radioactive fallout in
the air but not enough to do that
kind of damage not that quickly

MICHELLE
Yeah Looks more like the work of
some twisted freak with a knife
HOWARD
(to himself)
God grant me the serenity
Howard pulls the wand in Looks up at Michelle
HOWARD (CONTD)
There’s something else out there
Some sort of chemical like mustard
gas or worse
Michelle subtly braces herself against the wall
HOWARD (CONTD)
Whatever it is we sure as hell
can’t open this door

Without warning -- Michelle shoves Howard as hard as she can
He loses balance tumbles down the steps ass over elbows

Michelle grabs the door handle turns it But its locked

HOWARD (0S) (CONTD)
God damn it

Michelle frantically pulls at the door

Howard gets to his feet -- his body fills the bottom of the
stairwell blocking the light from the room

Michelle bangs on the small window

MICHELLE
Help Somebody help me

Howard rubs his shoulder as he climbs the stairs

HOWARD
What the hell is wrong with you

Theres real anger in his voice

Michelle smashes her crutch against the glass against the
handle but it’s pointless She begins sobbing slides down
the wall until her butt hits the stairs

MICHELLE
Please let me go Please I
promise I won’t tell anyone

Howard stops a few steps below her
HOWARD
(bordering on creepy)
There’s no one to tell
Michelle looks up at Howard horrified
MICHELLE
How long are you going to keep me

here

HOWARD
Youre not a prisoner

MICHELLE
(through her sobs)
Then open the fucking door

Howard leans in breathing right in her ear

Michelle cowers as his hand reaches toward her then past
her He switches off the Geiger counter

HOWARD
Youre not thinking straight
Probably have a concussion Then
there’s the shock of all this info

Howard stands back up towering over her
HOWARD (CONTD)

You open that door and whatevers

out there comes in here Is that

what you want To end up looking

like my hogs
Michelle can’t tell if it’s a warning or a threat
They stare at each other for a long moment

She finally shakes her head surrenders

Howard turns lumbers back down the stairs And as he goes
the sun sets outside leaving Michelle in near darkness

INT BATHROOM - LATER
Looking in the mirror Michelle peels the blood-crusted gauze

off her forehead The cut is still gruesome but the bleeding
has stopped She tapes on a clean piece of gauze

INT MAIN ROOM

Howard sits at the table fiddling with a small radio but
nothing’s being broadcast

Michelle crutches into the room Howard looks over
HOWARD
(spinning the dial)

See

MICHELLE
I see a broken radio

Howard shakes his head as Michelle crutches by him

INT SMALL BEDROOM

Michelle sleeps restlessly

EXT HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT - (FLASHBACK)

Michelle pushes through partying students on the porch as she
storms out of the house toward her car

Patrick continues after her

PATRICK
Come on Michelle I made a
mistake Give me another chance

MICHELLE
(slurring slightly)
Same thing my dad used to say And
my mom was stupid enough to believe
it Until he left her for good

PATRICK
This is about you and me Not them

Michelle opens her car door

MICHELLE
Youre right Its about you and
me And Lauren And thats one too
many

She gets in the car and slams the door Patrick grabs the
handle but its already locked

PATRICK
Get out of the car Youre not
alright to drive Seriously
Michelle peels away from the curb --

Two students jump out of the way

She squeals around a corner and disappears into the night

INT SMALL BEDROOM

Michelle wakes with a start She looks over to --

HOWARD standing silently in the doorway He turns and walks
away without a word

INT BATHROOM

Michelle inspects her damaged knee Then she glances at
Howards dresser drawers She crutches toward them keeping a

nervous eye on the door to the main room

HOWARD (0S)
You alright in there

She stops
MICHELLE
Yeah I’m fine
INT MAIN ROOM

Howard and Michelle sit at the table eating in silence He
looks at her but she keeps her eyes on her plate

HOWARD
(trying for small talk)
What were you doing in Milwaukee

Eyes down Michelle pushes her food around with her fork

MICHELLE
(almost robotic)
Visiting a friend
(a beat)
But he’s probably dead right
So what’s the point in talking
about it

So much for small talk Howard bites his tongue as he pushes
away from the table

FADE TO BLACK

INT BATHROOM

A few days have passed Michelle looks at herself in the
mirror She peels the gauze from her head The wound is
healed enough that she doesn’t replace the gauze

She runs water but sneaks from the bathroom -- using the
noise to mask her movement She hobbles into --
HOWARD’S ROOM

She crosses the room without her crutches limping but moving
reasonably well

Michelle opens a drawer and takes the magazine with the “HOW
TO MAKE A WEAPON OUT OF ANYTHING” cover

INT MAIN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Michelle maneuvers through the main room -- past Howard She
leans heavily on the crutches making it appear that she’s
completely dependent on them to get around

INT SMALL BEDROOM

Using the sharp edge of a soup can lid Michelle whittles
away at the end of one of her crutches slowly shaping it
into a point She hears Howard moving outside and quickly
rewraps the end with tape

INT SMALL BEDROOM - LATER
Michelle lies on her mattress as Howard unwraps the bandage

on her knee Michelle winces as the last layer sticks to her
pus-covered wound Howard tugs it off

MICHELLE
Ow Damn it That hurt

They both stare at the wound It’s gruesome

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
I need to go to a hospital I need
a real doctor

Howard ignores the dig

HOWARD
Where are you hiding them

MICHELLE
What are you talking about

HOWARD
The antibiotics

Michelle doesn’t answer

HOWARD (CONTD)
Think you’1l still be able to
refuse medicine when this turns
into gangrene and I have to saw
your leg off

Michelle looks from the wound to Howard He’s serious

She reaches into a small slit on the side of her mattress and
digs out a dozen pills She sets them on the bed

Howard separates them into two piles

HOWARD (CONTD)
(pointing at one pile)
You’re welcome to suffer through
the pain all you want
(points at the other pile)
But you will take the antibiotics

Michelle picks up one pill from each pile Pops them both
into her mouth and swallows

MICHELLE
Happy

Howard rewraps Michelle’s knee with a clean bandage then gets
up and heads for the door

HOWARD
I’m stuck down here too you know

He pulls the door shut on his way out

Michelle reaches over and grabs her crutch She unravels the
duct tape and goes back to work sharpening it into a point

The painkiller kicks in She groggily tucks the lid back
under the mattress then lies down and drifts to sleep

INT EXT MICHELLES CAR - NIGHT - (FLASHBACK)

Michelle speeds on a winding country road A truck pulls up
behind her Its LIGHTS GLARE in her rearview mirror It seems
to get closer and closer

Michelle swerves across the road drunkenly The truck HONKS

She guns the engine accelerates The truck keeps pace
tailgating her yet again

She glances at her rearview The glare blinds her

INT SMALL BEDROOM

Michelle jolts awake

The bedroom door is open but she’s alone She reaches for
her crutches notices that the tape at the foot of one of

them is unraveled the carved point clearly visible

She grabs it and tapes it up But she has no idea if Howard
was in the room to see it or not

She lies back on the bed for a moment listens Nothing but
the WHOOSH of air coming in through the vent above her

Michelle stares up at the vent -- an idea comes to her She
grabs her crutches and limps out of the room

INT MAIN ROOM

Michelle peeks into Howard’s room He snores on his mattress
She quietly closes his door then stares up at the ventilation

system above the kitchenette where two air ducts branch off
from the main register and pipe into the bedrooms

INT SMALL BEDROOM

Michelle strips the cover from her pillow She uses the spear-
point on her crutch to rip one end open and begins pulling

out the polyester stuffing

INT MAIN ROOM

Michelle climbs onto a folding chair beneath the main vent
She pulls off the cover and shoves the stuffing into the

ventilation system

When she has it all in she takes a crutch and pushes it as
far into the duct as possible

She climbs off the chair then reaches up and BANGS on the
vent with her crutch until Howard’s snoring stops

She hears him moving and quickly limps back into her room

INT SMALL BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Michelle catches a glimpse of Howard through the open door

She waits a beat then hobbles out of the bedroom

INT MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Howard is on a chair underneath the main duct His ear and
his hand are pressed up against the vent

Howard turns to Michelle -- deadly serious look on his face

HOWARD
The ventilation system is failing

Michelle’s face gives nothing away

MICHELLE
What are you gonna do

HOWARD
Don’t know If it’s the solar
panels we’re screwed because I
can’t go outside to repair them

He turns valves on the ducts that lead into the bedrooms

HOWARD (CONTD)
I’m shutting down the bedroom flow
Well have to limit ourselves to
this room Keep the system from
having to work so hard

He gets down from the chair

MICHELLE
What about the bathroom

HOWARD
I’1ll keep a bucket in here Short
of that you’ll have to be quick

Howard seems to be staring at the tape on the bottom of
Michelle’s crutches as he speaks

INT MAIN ROOM - LATER

Michelle sets two plates on the table unidentifiable blobs
of canned meat and pale vegetables on both

MICHELLE
Two years worth of food down here
and not a single piece of
chocolate

Howard stands on a folding chair his face against the vent

HOWARD
Surviving is about the essentials

Michelle drops into a chair exhausted She stares at the
wall of wine looks around the rest of the sparse room

MICHELLE
Yeah there’s no way a bag of
chocolates would’ve fit in here

HOWARD
Tell you what Next time I’m
planning for the apocalypse I’11l
make sure to buy candy bars Right
now we have more pressing problems

He gets down from the chair and joins Michelle at the table
They both struggle to catch their breath

HOWARD (CONT’D)
(somber )
We’re not getting enough oxygen
(MORE )

HOWARD (CONTD)
I might have to go outside and see
if I can fix it

MICHELLE
Thought it was poisonous outside

HOWARD
It is But we’re facing carbon
dioxide poisoning down here
Something has to be done

Howard picks up a fork and starts eating Michelle just
stares at her plate Is she having second thoughts

MICHELLE
If this crap is our last meal we
need something better than water to
wash it down

She crutches over to the wine rack and grabs a random bottle

HOWARD
You’re not old enough for that

MICHELLE
Feel free to call the cops

She sets the bottle on the table hobbles over and digs
through the utensil drawer

HOWARD
You were drinking the night you
crashed I could smell it on you

MICHELLE
(laughs)
Then drunk driving saved my life
Otherwise I’d be a skinless corpse
right
(frustrated)
Where’s the corkscrew

HOWARD
I’ve never opened a bottle down
here It’s just storage Guess
well have to make do with water

Michelle pulls off her shoe She grabs the bottle and puts
the base of it in the bottom of the shoe then starts gently
banging it against the nearby door frame

HOWARD (CONTD)
What are you doing

MICHELLE
Most parents won’t notice if a
bottle of wine disappears but they
will notice a missing corkscrew

Michelle is breathing heavily from the lack of oxygen but
little by little the wine forces the cork from the bottle

When it’s halfway up she twists it the rest of the way out

She takes a moment to catch her breath then fills her glass
She goes to fill Howard’s glass He holds his hand over it

HOWARD
I don’t drink

Michelle looks over at the wall of wine

MICHELLE
That just decorative

Howard looks down at his dinner plate

HOWARD
I used to I don’t anymore

Michelle raises her glass

MICHELLE
More for me then Cheers

She takes a big swig

INT MAIN ROOM - LATER

Michelle’s food is still uneaten but the wine bottle is half
empty The lack of oxygen mixed with the booze has her tipsy
She refills her glass

HOWARD
You’ve had enough

Michelle picks up her glass and takes a gulp She looks at
the full wine rack

MICHELLE
Why keep all those bottles if you
don’t drink

HOWARD
It’s a long story

MICHELLE
(sarcastic)
Yeah maybe you can tell me some
day when we have more time

Howard shrugs
HOWARD
Maybe I’11 tell you some day when

youre ready to listen

Michelle stares at the unappetizing food on the plate in
front of her

MICHELLE
I can’t look at this shit anymore

Michelle still tipsy grabs her plate and limps over to the
sink WITHOUT HER CRUTCHES

Howard watches her intently as she makes her way back to the
table and sits down next to her forgotten crutches

HOWARD
(suspiciously)
Your knee’s getting a lot better

Michelle takes another drink of wine plays it cool

MICHELLE
Guess the alcohol numbs the pain

Howard nods dubiously All of a sudden he gets up from his
chair and walks to the back of the room He digs a small key
ring out of his pocket and opens up the locked closet door

Howard pulls out the shovel before closing the door and
locking it

MICHELLE (CONTD)
What are you doing

HOWARD
Wondering how I could be so naive

Howard walks underneath the main duct tapping it with the
shovel handle as he goes

TAP -- a hollow echo TAP -- another hollow echo TAP -- same
hollow sound Howard glances at Michelle

She fights to keep a disinterested look on her face

He walks a few more feet Reaches up TAPS again -- and this
part of the duct answers with a muted THUMP

Howard climbs onto a chair He pushes the shovel deep into
the vent and starts fishing around

Michelle surreptitiously unwraps the tape from the bottom of
her crutch under the table as she keeps her eyes on Howard

Howard pulls the shovel out bringing a big chunk of
polyester pillow stuffing with it

Air immediately starts flowing into the room again
Howard looks at Michelle He’s furious

HOWARD (CONTD)
I pulled you from a crushed car
Kept you safe from whatever’s in
the air out there I gave you
antibiotics from my limited supply

He climbs off the chair shakes the edge of the shovel at her
as he speaks He doesn’t seem to notice her shaky hands
working underneath the table

HOWARD (CONTD)
You were a stranger I owed you
nothing But I helped you anyhow
And instead of thanking me you try
to kill us both

Howard takes a step toward Michelle She jumps up from the
table and thrusts her spike-tipped crutch at Howard He
knocks it aside with the shovel

She pulls it back ready to strike again

MICHELLE
Is that your plan Lock me up and
keep telling me how thankful I
should be until I throw myself at
you Well it’s never gonna happen
(raises the spear higher)
I won’t let you hurt me

HOWARD
That’s the beauty of it I don’t
have to

He throws the shovel down

HOWARD (CONTD)
I’m gonna let you hurt yourself

He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his key ring Sets
it on the table

HOWARD (CONTD)
It’s the small brass one

Michelle hesitates for a long moment not sure if she
believes him not sure if this is some kind of a test

HOWARD (CONTD)
Youre free to go

Howard drags the couch away from the stairwell

Keeping the crutch pointed in front of her Michelle steps
forward grabs the keys off the table

She limps toward the exit crutch at the ready

HOWARD (CONTD)
Theres just one thing

Howard’s voice wavers between menace and regret

HOWARD (CONTD)
Once you leave you cant come
back Youll be covered with
whatever it is that melted the skin
off my hogs Go ahead and kill
yourself if you like But I’m not
going to let you kill me too Your
choice

Michelle makes her way into the --

STAIRWELL - DAY

She slowly climbs the stairs Daylight filters in through the
tiny window above

She gets to the top fumbles with the key ring --
She sticks the small brass key in the lock --

She pauses looks back down the stairs Howard’s nowhere to
be seen But he calls out --

HOWARD (0S)
Leave the keys in the door And be
quick to close it

Michelle pauses Decision time She hesitates --
And then the daylight from the window suddenly goes DARK

Michelle spins around -- a man in a hazmat hood presses
against the window -- looking right at her

He BANGS frantically

MAN
(muffled)
Open the door Open the god damn
door

Michelle SCREAMS in terror

Howard rushes to the bottom of the stairs sees the figure on
the other side of the window --

HOWARD
Do not open that door

Michelle panics spins the key unlocking the door

Before Howard can get up to her the man pulls open the door
and enters pushing into Michelle -- TOUCHING HER --

The man blocks Michelle from getting out He spins back
shuts and locks the door Then strips off his hazmat hood

MAN
(whispering)
Shh We don’t want them to find us

This is NATE (20s) his matted hair and dirty face only
enhance his rugged good looks

MICHELLE
Who

NATE
(whispering)
Get back Get away from me

Howard disappears down the stairwell Michelle hesitates
Maybe it’s the booze or the lack of oxygen -- or maybe it’s

something in Nate’s voice that convinces her But Michelle
backs down the stairs away from the door

Nate looks out the window one more time before he heads down
into the --

MAIN ROOM

Howard stands on a chair under the vent turning the valves
on the ducts that lead to the bedrooms

HOWARD
We need to get that suit cleaned
off Right now

Nate hurries past Michelle into Howard’s room -- he clearly
knows his way around

MICHELLE
What the hell is going on

HOWARD
(a concerned look)
That’s Nate

MICHELLE
You know him

Howard nods but not happily He gets down from the chair and
heads for his bedroom
INT BATHROOM

Nate strips off the suit Underneath he’s only wearing a pair
of boxers and few tattoos He throws the suit in the tub

Howard comes in and starts running the water over it
Nate looks back sees Michelle in the bedroom doorway He
hurries into --

HOWARD’S ROOM

-- in just his boxers Michelle can’t help but notice Nate is
in great shape

NATE
You touched the suit You need to
get washed off right away

He reaches for her She doesn’t resist He leads her back to
the --

BATHROOM

Howard scrubs the suit which is completely submerged Nate
holds a towel under the faucet -- but the water flow has
reduced to a drip Nate begins to put the towel in the tub

HOWARD
No Water might be contaminated

Howard closes the faucet

HOWARD (CONTD)
Try the sink

Nate spins the sink faucet It sputters and a weak stream of
water flows out

Nate wets the towel as he turns to Michelle
NATE
Those clothes have to go Throw ‘em
in the tub with the suit Then wash
yourself down

MICHELLE
What

NATE
If you want to keep your skin you
need to lose your clothes Now

Michelle takes the towel pauses looks at Nate then Howard
who’s paying no attention as he cleans the hazmat suit

Nate sighs turns away from her

NATE (CONTD)
No time to be modest

Michelle strips down to her underwear

Nate keeps his back to her but turns enough to sneak a peek
in the mirror as Michelle washes herself down with the towel
ON HOWARD

He turns the hazmat suit inside out to scrub the rest

And he sees -- written on the inside in permanent marker
PROPERTY OF JOHN BENNETT PIKEVILLE FIRE DEPT

Howard stares at the name his face tightening up He glances
at Nate who still has his back turned
INT MAIN ROOM - LATER

Nate now in a pair of Howard’s jeans and a t-shirt sits at
the table with Howard They speak in tense whispers

HOWARD
Got some nerve showing up here now

NATE

You said I was always welcome
HOWARD

A lot’s changed since then And you

know it
Michelle walks in dressed in a different set of clothes
Nate eyes her as she heads for the couch

NATE
(to Howard)
A little greedy wanting to keep
this all for yourself

She sits on the couch and looks at the men distrustfully

MICHELLE
(to Howard re Nate)
He was out there He seems fine

HOWARD
Because of the hazmat suit
(stares at Nate)
Lucky you happened to have that

MICHELLE
(to Howard)
This all part of the plan You
couldn’t convince me so you called
for backup

NATE
What’s her problem

HOWARD
Not sure where to start

MICHELLE
Youre both full of shit and now
youre sitting there trying to get
your lies straight

NATE
You seriously think I’ve been
standing at the top of the stairs
in a hazmat suit for a week -- just
waiting for you to open the door

When he puts it that way it does sound like a stretch

MICHELLE
I don’t know what to think anymore

NATE
Lucky you This is one of those
cases where ignorance is bliss

HOWARD
(under his breath)
Then she should be ecstatic

Nate gets up from the table walks over to Michelle He
offers his hand along with his most charming look

NATE
I’m Nate I built this place --
HOWARD
You helped
Nate ignores him -- keeps his focus on Michelle
NATE

What’s your name

MICHELLE
Michelle

He reaches out and she gives him a half-hearted shake Nate
takes a seat on the couch next to her still holding her hand

NATE
I wasn’t expecting to find anyone
but Howard here
(flashes a magnetic smile)
Guess my luck finally took a turn

Nate squeezes Michelle’s hand She pulls it away guardedly

NATE (CONTD)
Nice to meet you Michelle

Out of the corner of her eye Michelle glimpses Howard
furrowing his eyebrows at the sight of Nate next to her

Michelle turns offers Nate a forced smile

MICHELLE
Nice to meet you too Nate

HOWARD
(interrupting the moment)
So how is it out there

NATE

Something’s still in the air Not
as bad as it was but

(a beat)
On the way here I came across a
guy that looked like he’d been
dropped in a deep-fryer That’d
been me if I didn’t have a suit

MICHELLE
Did everyone but me know the world
was about to end

Howard stands moves closer to them

HOWARD
So what happened Who’s behind it

NATE
Well there was a lot of talk
But not a lot of answers

Nate leans forward on the couch Howard and Michelle stare
with anticipation This guy knows how to tell a story

NATE (CONTD)

It’s all just rumors But word
is Iran got hold of some Russian
stockpiles -- nuclear chemical

the works Hired some fanatical
whack jobs to hand deliver the
bombs Then they exploded the
chemical stuff everywhere else

MICHELLE
Russians probably made it easy for
them

HOWARD
Hold on a second I rescue you
Keep you safe And you refuse to
believe a word I say But this guy
shows up and tells us the obvious
and you buy in

NATE
I have an honest face

MICHELLE
I didn’t say I believed him It’s
just his story makes sense

Michelle startles as the ventilation system GROANS then
starts emitting a cyclical CLUNKING sound

HOWARD
Christ Your little stunt must’ve
damaged the system

MICHELLE

Can you fix it
HOWARD

Id have to go out for that
MICHELLE

I’1l do it

NATE HOWARD
No Not a chance in hell

Michelle’s taken aback by their adamant response

HOWARD
You’ve done enough damage already

NATE
And it’s not safe There are people
out there Not a lot but a few
Scavengers They’re desperate

MICHELLE
Shouldnt we try to help them

HOWARD
The water pump’s stressed The
ventilation system’s struggling
There are too many of us down here
already

INT HOWARD’S ROOM

Howard puts on the hazmat suit He doesn’t pull down the mask
yet He walks out into the --

MAIN ROOM

Michelle and Nate are on the couch -- and too close to each
other Howard looks them over grits his teeth

HOWARD
If I can’t get it fixed then I’m
not sure we can support three
people down here

NATE
What are we gonna do draw straws

HOWARD
It’s my cellar I decide

NATE
Get on out there
(laughs)
You could use some fresh air

Howard exhales irritably closes the mask without responding

EXT FARM HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
Dark and overcast

The modest farm house sits in the middle of nowhere Fallow
fields in front thick woods in back

The dead pigs rot in their pen

The cellar door opens Howard steps out He looks back as the
door slams shut

INT MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Michelle stands by the table Nate comes down the stairs and
takes a seat on the couch

MICHELLE
You really think he’d make you
leave

NATE
(shrugs)
He didn’t say it’d be me He just
said he gets to decide

Michelle walks over and sits down next to Nate

MICHELLE
Youd let him kick me out

NATE
Howard’s shit when it comes to
people but he’s good with
machines He’1ll fix it

Not exactly the answer Michelle was looking for

MICHELLE
Something happen between you two

NATE
He hired me to help him convert
this place to what it is now About
halfway through he started
changing everything But didn’t
want to pay So I walked Guess
he’s still pissed off about it

MICHELLE
And you think you think he’s
alright

NATE
Did something happen between you
two

MICHELLE

No It’s just he seems off

NATE
Everyone thought he was nuts when
he built this place But then
again I guess he was right

EXT BARN ROOF - LATE AFTERNOON

Howard climbs to the top of a ladder As he steps onto the
roof something catches his leg

He looks back -- it’s a bent nail tugging at the hazmat
suit nearly causing it to rip

Howard carefully takes a step back and releases himself from
the nail

He then moves across the roof in the wan light His BREATH
FOGS the plastic mask

He stops at the solar panels A large tree branch has fallen
across the panels Two of the four are cracked Howard shoves
the branch to the side

The branch rolls off the edge of the barn and lands with an
echoing WHACK Howard freezes looks around

Nothing but emptiness and silence And then --

THWOCKA-THWOCKA-THWOCKA-THWOCKA Howard spins around and --

HOWARD’S POV

On the horizon something in the air way out in the distance
-- maybe a helicopter

Howard wipes the fog from his face mask

His hand moves away but whatever it was has slipped behind a
hill before Howard can make heads or tails of it

CUTTING WIDE

Howard stares at the horizon but it’s empty He turns back to
the roof looks over the rest of the solar panels

EXT FARM HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Howard heads for the cellar door He stops turns and makes
for the front door of the farm house instead

INT FARM HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Howard opens the closet door in his bedroom He pulls out a
small safe and sets it on his bed

He unlocks it --

The safe door opens revealing a revolver and a box of ammo

INT FARM HOUSE - BACK STAIRWELL - LATE AFTERNOON

Howard comes down the stairs into the --

KITCHEN

Howard grabs a plastic trash bag from under the sink He
stuffs the gun and ammo into it then pulls open a cabinet
INT STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

Howard enters the cellar locking the door behind him He
hurries down the stairs trash bag in hand

INT MAIN ROOM

Howard gives Nate and Michelle a thumbs up as he rushes past
them toward his room

INT BATHROOM

Howard steps into the bathroom takes the gun out of the
trash bag and quickly wraps it in a towel He throws the bag
in the tub Then he begins stripping out of the hazmat suit
Michelle pulls aside the shower curtain

MICHELLE (0S)
See anything out there

Howard pauses considers his answer

HOWARD
Nope Nothing

Howard turns on the water -- a weak stream drips
Nate steps up behind Michelle

NATE
What’s in the bag

Howard pulls the bag from the tub reaches inside and pulls
out a sealed bag of Hershey’s miniature chocolates He wipes
it with a wet towel then throws it to Michelle with a smile

HOWARD
Dessert

INT MAIN ROOM

Howard and Michelle sit at the table as Nate works at the
kitchenette behind them

Michelle fills two glasses to the brim with wine Howard
watches a look of disappointment on his face

NATE
(with flair)
The house special for the lady

Nate sets a plate down in front of Michelle It’s the same
canned food but he’s arranged things to look almost
appetizing

Michelle smiles
Howard rolls his eyes turns a suspicious eye to Nate

HOWARD
Where did you get that hazmat suit

Howard keeps his eyes on Nate who pauses before he answers --

NATE
I’m a volunteer firefighter When
the attack happened I went
straight to the firehouse We all
suited up waiting for orders But
nothing came Land lines cell
phones radios -- everything was
dead Didn’t take long before most
of the guys went home to check on
their families When none of them
came back I figured I’d take my
chances and come here

HOWARD
I didn’t know you were volunteering
at the fire department

NATE
Just started a few months back
(pointed)
If you came into town more often
you’d know that

HOWARD
Charlie still running the show down
there

NATE
Charlie Yeah He sure is

Howard locks eyes with Nate
HOWARD
My old pal John Bennett volunteers
too You must know John

A moment of tension -- Nate’s eyes say be careful

NATE
Nope Must not have the same shift

Howard and Nate stare each other down

Nate turns to Michelle takes a sip of his wine Swishes it
in his mouth

NATE (CONTD)
Oh that’s nice A little oaky with
hints of raspberry Mmmm Smooth
finish

Howard looks up from his plate

HOWARD
Don’t know what you’re talking
about do you

Nate holds his glass out to Howard

NATE
Wanna show me how it’s done

Howard ignores the question -- he just stares at Nate
NATE (CONTD)
(turns to Michelle)
What do you taste Michelle

Michelle takes a sip Swishes it the same way Nate did

MICHELLE
I do taste the raspberry

NATE
(smiles at Howard)
How can you argue with that

Howard struggles to cover up his irritation

INT MAIN ROOM - LATER

Empty dinner plates and crumpled candy wrappers Nate washes
down the last of the wine

Howard pushes his dish and silverware toward Nate

HOWARD
I bought dinner How about you do
the washing up

Nate pushes the plate back toward Howard

NATE
I’m still thirsty Michelle why
don’t you grab another bottle
(still looking at Howard)
It’s not like we have to drive
anywhere

Michelle gets up -- drunkenly wobbles to the wine rack

HOWARD
(quietly to Nate)
Remember this is my cellar and
that’s my wine You’re just a
guest

NATE
(leans in close)
Then start treating me like a
guest
Howard stands up walks into his room and closes the door

Michelle limps back over with a new bottle of wine

MICHELLE
What was that all about

NATE
Howard used to have a drinking
problem

MICHELLE

I know He told me

NATE
He also tell you about his wife

Michelle shakes her head

NATE (CONTD)
I guess he wouldn’t About three
years ago she was killed He wasn’t
charged but most folks around here
figured it fairly suspicious

Michelle drops into her seat

MICHELLE
Oh my god That’s awful Then who
has his daughter

NATE
What daughter

MICHELLE
He told me that he has a daughter
in Washington DC

NATE
Howard never had any kids

Michelle sets the wine bottle on the table suddenly her
thoughts a jumble

MICHELLE
Why would he lie about that

Nate takes the bottle starts opening it
NATE
(ominous )
I don’t know Maybe to gain your
trust But we ought to be watching
out for each other Pressure seems
to be getting to him down here

Nate fills Michelle’s empty glass with more wine

INT MAIN ROOM - LATER

Nate sits on the couch very close to Michelle She holds a
nearly empty glass of wine in her lap Her head bobs Nate
takes the glass off her lap and sets it on the floor

He turns and leans in for a kiss

MICHELLE
Nooo mmmmmm

Michelle pushes him away clumsily

Howard opens his door comes into the room

Nate breaks off from his attempted make-out session

Howard grabs some crackers out of the cupboard He sits at
the table and slowly goes about opening them staring daggers

at Nate the entire time

Nate stares right back as Michelle falls sideways on the
couch and passes out Nate looks at her then back at Howard

Nate gets up off the couch

NATE
Guess I’1l1 take the bed tonight

Nate goes into the small bedroom and slams the door

Howard eats his crackers while staring at Michelle

INT MAIN ROOM
Howard SAWS and HAMMERS on a piece of wood

The bedroom door opens Nate comes out holding his head
looking like complete shit

Howard whacks at a nail notices Nate wincing with each
strike

NATE
What the hell time is it

Howard looks around the windowless cellar

HOWARD
Does it matter

NATE
Where’s Michelle

HOWARD
She’s in the bathroom Throwing up
You must be proud of yourself

Nate settles into a chair as Howard goes back to his
hammering -- a big smile on his face each time Nate winces

Michelle stumbles in holding her head with both hands She
collapses to the couch Her face is the same color as the
cinder block walls

MICHELLE
I think that stuff is seeping in
here Feels like my skin is peeling
off

HOWARD
So you finally believe me

Howard pounds in another nail
NATE
Can you stop hammering for a
minute

Howard stops hammering He looks over to Nate

HOWARD
Almost done

NATE
With what

HOWARD
The frame on one of the solar
panels was broken This should hold
it for a while at least

NATE
When’re you gonna take it out

HOWARD
I’m not You are

NATE
Why me

HOWARD

Because it’s time you start earning

your keep
INT MAIN ROOM - LATER
Nate climbs the stares in the hazmat suit holding the wooden
corner Howard waits until he hears the door close then he
walks up the --
STAIRWELL

And locks the door behind Nate

INT MAIN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Howard sits down next to Michelle on the couch

HOWARD
Nate’s a liar

MICHELLE
What are you talking about

HOWARD
The hazmat suit It had someone
else’s name in it

MICHELLE
So he grabbed the wrong suit in the
panic

HOWARD

He also said Charlie Winston was
still fire chief But Charlie
retired years ago I was at the
party

MICHELLE
What’s your point

HOWARD
If he doesn’t work at the fire
department how’d he get the suit
And what happened to the guy who’s
name is on it

MICHELLE
Why don’t you just ask him

HOWARD
Look Nate’s been in and out of
trouble for as long as I’ve known
him Spent some time in prison --
mostly small stuff But he’s gota
violent streak in him You should
be careful

Just then -- pounding from the top of the stairwell
Howard doesn’t move

MICHELLE
Let him in

HOWARD
Did you hear what I just told you
He can’t be trusted

MICHELLE
Let Him In

Howard gets up heads for the stairwell

INT MAIN ROOM

Howard and Nate finish their meal Michelle stands at the
sink watching water drip from the open faucet into her empty
glass

MICHELLE
It’s getting worse

HOWARD
We’re using too much water

Nate takes his dish over to Michelle Tosses it in the sink

NATE
Leave ‘em Howard’1l figure it out

He playfully slaps her ass She jumps swats at him --
MICHELLE
(flirting)
Can you please not do that

NATE
It’s really hard not to

Nate winks Michelle smiles

MICHELLE
God

Howard’s stomach turns as he watches them He pushes back his
chair It SCRAPES loudly grabbing Nate and Michelles
attention

HOWARD
Fuck it

He crosses to the wine rack selects a bottle He turns back
and hands it to Michelle

HOWARD (CONTD)
Go on open it

Michelle goes through the process
Howard pulls out TWO wine glasses sets them on the table

Michelle pulls the cork out and puts the bottle down Howard
pours two small portions into the glasses

HOWARD (CONTD)
1986 Montrachet Best bottle in the
cellar You don’t want to know what
it’s worth But the idea of it
sitting down here untouched as
the world ends -- or worse yet
having you two heathens drink it on
your own without half a clue
what’s on your lips -- well that
thought is more than I can bear

Howard sets one glass in front of Michelle picks up the
other himself He swirls the wine puts his nose to the glass
and inhales deeply He smiles

HOWARD (CONTD)
Cheers

Michelle doesn’t touch her glass Howard clinks it anyway
then takes a mouthful of the wine

HOWARD (CONTD)
That’s the stuff

Howard picks the bottle up fills his glass to the rim And
chugs the entire glass as Nate and Michelle watch in silence

NATE
Don’t you want to savor it

Howard ignores him

HOWARD
(to Michelle)
Try it

She doesn’t move

HOWARD (CONTD)
What’s wrong with you That’s a few
hundred dollars worth of wine in
your glass It’s oaky With a hint
of raspberries

Michelle watches as Howard pours himself another full glass

MICHELLE
Maybe you should slow down

Howard pounds the wine

HOWARD
(glares at Michelle)
What’s the problem princess You
couldn’t get enough last night

NATE
Back off

HOWARD
I wasn’t talking to you
(back to Michelle)
Were you visiting your boyfriend in
Milwaukee

Michelle doesn’t answer

HOWARD (CONTD)
Pretty girl like you Youve
probably had plenty of boyfriends
Those poor saps They didn’t have a
clue what they were getting into

NATE
(growling)
I said leave her alone

Howard’s gaze shifts to Nate He lifts his glass but doesn’t
drink

HOWARD
You know what this is This thing
I’ve done for both of you It’s
called charity And when someone
provides you with charity the
polite thing to do is thank them

NATE
You wouldn’t have this place if it
weren’t for me

HOWARD
I could’ve hired any old vagrant to
do a half-assed job
(a beat)
Hindsight being what it is I wish
I had

Nate picks up the wine bottle but keeps his eyes on Howard

NATE
You spent all your money on this
cellar And for what

Nate takes a big swig straight from the bottle He swishes it
in his mouth leans over and spits it on the floor

NATE (CONT’D)
To protect a bunch of shitty wine

Howard’s expression turns dark and unhinged

He jumps up -- flings his wine glass at Nate It CRASHES into
the table Glass and wine splatter into Nate’s face

Howard charges --

HOWARD
You fucking ingrate

Nate wipes the wine from his eyes as Howard SLAMS into him
They collide into the wall Nate takes the brunt of the hit
in his back -- the oxygen rushes out of his lungs

MICHELLE
Stop it

Howard steps back throws a haymaker

Nate ducks the punch and swings a fist into Howard’s gut
Howard GROANS in drunken pain And just like that the fight
has turned Howard has lost the initiative Older drunker
and weaker -- he’s in trouble

Nate comes up with a crushing upper cut --

Howard stumbles backwards -- stunned Nate stalks forward
jabs Howard follows with a right hook --

SMACK Full impact Howard’s head snaps back his body
careens into the wine rack and --

Dozens of bottles SHATTER Wine EXPLODES in all directions
Glass rips through Howard’s skin as he tumbles to the ground

Nate kicks Howard in the ribs Hard

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
That’s enough

Michelle grabs Nate around the stomach pulls him away

Howard groggily looks up from the ground encircled by broken
glass and Cabernet
NATE
You fuckin’ come at me again and I
won’t stop Hear me
Nate stomps into Michelle’s bedroom leaving Howard and
Michelle to stare at each other
INT BATHROOM
Howard looks at himself in the mirror picks shards of glass
from his back
INT MAIN ROOM
Michelle sweeps up the mess She looks shaken Whatever the
hell is going on it’s getting worse and she’s starting to
lose her composure
INT HOWARD’S ROOM
Howard is now bandaged up He listens to Michelle SWEEPING
GLASS Then climbs into his bed each cut and bruise
screaming at him
INT MAIN ROOM
Michelle lies down on the couch with a blanket Her spike-
tipped crutch lies on the floor in front of her
INT MAIN ROOM - MORNING
A GLASS held under the faucet but no water comes out

Michelle stands at the sink a concerned look on her face as
she stares at her empty glass

Howard walks out of his room His REVOLVER is holstered on
his hip

Michelle eyes the gun

MICHELLE
It’s not working at all

Howard comes over to have a look as Nate enters from
Michelle’s room

NATE
(conciliatory )
Listen Howard I gotta say

But his words fade away as he sees the gun

NATE (CONTD)
What the hell is that for

HOWARD
This cellar is mine I’m in charge
down here You either get in line
or you get the hell out

Nate releases a blustery chuckle
Howard reaches down touches the butt of the gun

HOWARD (CONT’D)
You want to try me

NATE
Okay Howard Whatever you say

Howard nods then turns his attention to the faucet

HOWARD
(under his breath)
Too damn many of us down here

Michelle eyes both men an uneasy look on her face

INT MAIN ROOM - LATER

Howard removes a throw rug from the floor Underneath
there’s a trap door He pulls it open revealing a narrow
crawl space Howard nods to Nate hands him a flashlight --

HOWARD
You first

Nate grimaces but climbs down into the crawl space Howard
turns to Michelle

HOWARD (CONTD)
I want you up by the door If you
see any water running through the
yard you come let me know

Michelle nods as Howard drops down into the crawl space She
climbs over the couch and into the --
STAIRWELL

At the top of the stairs Michelle looks out the window --

MICHELLE’S POV

The yard The dead pigs The barn And the front end of the
pickup This time it’s not obscured by reflecting sunlight
CLOSE ON

MICHELLE -- staring at the yellow paint and large dent on the
old truck

Suddenly her blood runs cold as her memory kicks in --

INT EXT MICHELLES CAR - NIGHT - (FLASHBACK)
Michelle is blinded by the headlight glare in her rearview

She nearly veers off the road wrenches the steering wheel at
the last possible moment

The truck behind her HONKS again and pulls alongside her
Michelle looks over at the truck -- DENTED YELLOW OLD

Michelles eyes flit back to the road but theres a turn
ahead and its too close

The truck swerves -- is it trying to run her off the road or
is it just trying to pass her

Michelle overcompensates as she turns away from the truck
her car weaves toward the edge of the road --

She slams on the breaks twists the wheel --
The car SQUEALS across the pavement --

Michelle knows she wont make it Her eyes open wide in pure
terror

INT STAIRWELL - DAY

Michelle stares at the old truck -- the same one as in the
flashback She hyperventilates struggles to regain control
of her breathing

She tries the door handle Locked A long beat of shallow
breaths and then she turns and heads down the stairs

INT MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Howard and Nate climb out of the crawl space Nate has a
small pump in his hands

Michelle stands by the men -- a troubled look on her face

HOWARD
You alright

MICHELLE
Yeah Fine
(changing the subject)
What’s with the engine

HOWARD
It’s a pump And it’s busted

NATE
I can fix it

HOWARD
Let’s hope you’re right
INT MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
Nate works on the pump Michelle puts together another meal

Howard walks in from his room He doesn’t say a word just
pulls a bottle of wine off the wall and hands it to Michelle

She opens it Nate fidgets with the pump doesn’t look up
Howard pulls out a single wine glass sets it on the table
Michelle pulls out the cork It drops to the floor

As Howard reaches down for it Michelle slips liquid Ketamine
into his glass

Howard comes up with the cork sets it on the table

Michelle pours him a full glass of wine and forces a smile
Howard nods takes a sip

HOWARD
A little off Might be corked

He spins the wine sniffs it
Michelle watches nervously

HOWARD (CONTD)
But I guess we can’t let it go to
waste Especially now that our
reserves have been depleted

Howard takes a big drink

INT MAIN ROOM - LATER
Howard is slumped on the couch unconscious
Nate and Michelle stand over him

MICHELLE
It was his truck He ran me off the
road that night
(shivers )
He planned to bring me here Guess
he figured he’d at least have a
plaything for the end of the world

NATE
He’s never been the most stable
guy And now that he’s drinking
again

Nate pulls the gun from Howard’s holster

NATE (CONTD)
Best that we hold onto this for
safe keeping

MICHELLE
He’s gonna freak when he wakes up

NATE
Let him Not much he can do if I’m
holding the gun

MICHELLE
What about me

NATE
I’1l protect you
(nods at the stairs)
Or we could just take care of it
for good

MICHELLE
You want to throw him out

He shrugs Michelle shifts warily
NATE
He’s been talking about doing the
same to us

Michelle works this over in her mind slowly shakes her head

MICHELLE
I can’t do it

NATE
Fine Without the gun he can’t
hurt us

Nate looks deeply into her eyes

Michelle produces a cautious smile Nate leans in for a kiss
And it’s decision time

Michelle balks turns away

NATE (CONT’D)
What’s wrong

MICHELLE
You’1l1 take care of me right

NATE
We’ll take care of each other

Michelle reads between the lines She leans in kisses Nate

INT SMALL BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Nate and Michelle naked on the bed having the kind of wild
passionate sex that only happens with the world coming to an
end

Michelle MOANS in ecstasy

INT MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Howard on the couch His eyes flicker open He rubs his face
Michelle’s MOANS echo from the other room

Howard’s brain slowly returns to consciousness as Michelle
works her way toward an orgasm

Howard reaches down to his waist His gun is missing

The look on Howard’s face is chilling as he begins to piece
together what’s happened

With one final SQUEAL of ecstasy Michelle’s noise dies down
And then Howard hears someone coming his way He closes his
eyes feigns like he’s still passed out

Michelle enters and heads for the bathroom -- wearing only
her PANTIES

Howard’s eyes open to slits He covertly watches her pass

INT HOWARD’S ROOM - LATER

Howard sits on his mattress propped up on his pillow against
the back wall He drinks from an open wine bottle

Nate comes into the bedroom the revolver tucked into his
waistband in clear view

HOWARD
Give me back my gun

Nate passes by him and walks into the bathroom

NATE (0S)
Not gonna happen

Howard takes another slug of wine as he’s forced to listen to
Nate PEE in the toilet

Nate steps out of the bathroom heads for the door
HOWARD
Guess you never plan on sleeping

again

Nate stops walks over to Howard kicking an empty wine
bottle out of the way

NATE
Good point Give me your keys

HOWARD
Fuck you

Howard takes another drink
Nate pulls the gun points it at Howard’s head
Nate’s demeanor is darker and colder than we’ve seen it

NATE
Give me the fuckin’ keys or you’re
going to be lying out there next to

your dead pigs

Michelle appears in the doorway of Howard’s room surprised
by Nate’s tone

HOWARD
(to Michelle)
This is who you decided to throw
your lot in with After all I’ve
done for you

Michelle marches over Stands at Nate’s side

MICHELLE
All youve done for me You mean
like running me off the road and
nearly killing me

Howard’s face shifts through emotions -- lands on anger

HOWARD
(pointing at Nate)
This asshole tell you that

MICHELLE
I saw your truck It was you

HOWARD
You were unconscious you don’t
remember shit I saved you

MICHELLE
You have an answer for everything
But why are there always so many
questions

Nate pulls back the hammer on the revolver

NATE
I’m only going to say it once more
Give me the keys

His finger tenses on the trigger He’s really going to shoot
Howard

Howard reaches into his pocket pulls out his key ring hands
it over

Nate smiles -- really enjoying this now

NATE (CONTD)
The pump is fixed When you sober
up take it down to the well

INT SMALL BEDROOM

Nate and Michelle stand at the door Nate turns the key in
the lock

NATE
This door requires a key on either
side Whenever we’re in here this
stays locked If you get up to use
the bathroom you wake me first If
this door’s unlocked I need to
know about it

Michelle lets out a small laugh
MICHELLE
First I’m locked in a cellar Now
I’m locked in a room in that
cellar Just keeps getting better
Nate turns on her a cold look in his eyes --
NATE
You take this seriously or you

could end up dead

Michelle is put off by his tone She wipes away her smile and
nods

INT MAIN ROOM

The trap door to the crawl space is open Howard pokes his
head out looks at Nate who is near the sink

HOWARD
Should be working

Nate turns the faucet Water POURS in a thick stream

Howard pulls himself up through the trap door and closes it
drags the throw rug back over it

NATE
You were down there so long I
thought you might have fallen in

Nate smiles cheerfully Howard sneers

HOWARD
You’re one hell of a bastard
coming in here taking over

NATE
Shit You didn’t give me any
choice But you were right about
one thing This place It’s not big
enough for three people

HOWARD
Youre going to kick me out

NATE
Well I’m not going anywhere And
neither is Michelle Guess that
only leaves you She needs a little
convincing but she’ll come around

Nate looks over as Michelle enters from the bedroom

NATE (CONT’D)
Hey baby

MICHELLE
Morning
(a beat)
If it is morning God I hate having
no idea what time it is

Nate opens the cupboard Grabs a can of beans
NATE
Being that all our meals are
basically the same guess it really
doesn’t matter much

Michelle offers a weak smile

Howard processes Nate’s words His face is ashen

INT MAIN ROOM - LATER

Nate Michelle and Howard sit around the table finishing
their meal

Howard’s halfway through another bottle of wine Nate pushes
his empty plate in front of Howard

NATE
Clean that up would ya

Nate gets up from the table the revolver visible in his
waistband

NATE (CONTD)
This food is killing me

He pats his belly as he walks toward Howard’s room

NATE (CONTD)
(with a smile)
Just remember I tried to get you
to spend the extra money for a vent
above the toilet

HOWARD
Least you could do is close the
door

Nate swings Howard’s bedroom door closed behind him

Howard leans in close to Michelle He speaks in a hushed
whisper

HOWARD (CONTD)
You were right

MICHELLE
About what

HOWARD
This is all a put on There was no
attack Nate and I planned this
from the start He talked me into
it Said we could get a girl down
here and nobody would ever know

Michelle is caught completely off guard
MICHELLE
Why are you telling me this

HOWARD
Isn’t it obvious I’m jealous You
weren’t supposed to be only for
him

Michelle’s stomach turns

MICHELLE
Youre lying

HOWARD

About there being an attack or
about there not being an attack

(a wry smile)
You fell for it Now you’re his
little toy and I’m locked down here
to suffer until he tires of you
And god only knows what’s gonna
happen then He can’t just let you
walk out can he

MICHELLE
Why would I believe you

HOWARD
Because you know it’s true And
youll never be safe as long as he
has that gun

MICHELLE
Giving you the gun isn’t gonna make
me feel any better

HOWARD
Tell you what just get me the
keys I’1l find a phone and call
the police What do you have to
lose Either you’re rid of me for
good or else I’1ll bring back help

Michelle looks doubtful
HOWARD (CONTD)
I can get you out of here back to
your family to your life But only
if you help me
The toilet FLUSHES

Howard peers at Michelle She doesn’t say a word

INT HOWARD’S ROOM
Howard sleeps on the mattress
Michelle comes in and nudges him awake

Howard’s eyes open Michelle’s kneeling next to him The key
ring JANGLES softly in her hand

Howard shakes off the cobwebs and grabs the keys from her

INT MAIN ROOM

The door to the small bedroom is closed Michelle sits on the
couch anxiously picking at her fingernails

Howard comes out dressed in a hazmat suit They whisper --

MICHELLE

If it’s all the lie why are you

wearing the suit
HOWARD

Nate still has a gun If he’s awake

when I come back we’1ll tell him I

had to check on the solar panels

MICHELLE
Are you coming back

Just then the bedroom door whips open

Nate comes out gun drawn

NATE
Where the hell you think you’re
going

HOWARD

The electricity’s shorting out I
need to check the panels

Nate sees the key ring in Howard’s hand He turns to
Michelle eyes ablaze with rage

MICHELLE
He said it was an emergency

NATE
And you didn’t wake me

MICHELLE

I was scared I panicked

Nate flicks on the overhead light It’s working fine
NATE
(to Howard)
You’re free to go But the suit
stays here

Howard turns and heads back toward his bedroom

NATE (CONT’D)
The keys Leave them on the table

Howard complies
Nate steps toward Michelle a menacing look on his face
NATE (CONTD)

I thought we were getting

somewhere you and me
He reaches up and gently rubs her chin with his hand that
still holds the revolver A shiver runs through Michelle when
the cold metal touches her face

INT SMALL BEDROOM

Nate sleeps on the mattress Michelle sits next to him
propped against her pillow staring at the blank wall

She moves to get out of bed but stops Shakes Nate His hand
whips from under the pillow gun pointed at Michelle

She flinches Then gently pushes his gun arm away from her

MICHELLE
I gotta use the bathroom

Nate sits up He unties the key ring from his waistband
hands it to Michelle
INT HOWARD’S ROOM

Howard snores loudly on his mattress Two empty wine bottles
rest on the cement floor next to his bed

Michelle tiptoes by him into the --

She pulls the curtain closed
Howard’s snoring stops

Michelle finishes peeing She pulls up her underwear parts
the shower curtains to leave --

Howard stands there leering at her with drunken eyes

MICHELLE
It’s all yours

She moves to slide by him But he steps in front of her

HOWARD
You’re too good for me But you’1ll
lie down with that cretin

MICHELLE
Get out of the way

HOWARD
You’ve given me nothing but trouble
since you got here I should’ve
left you in that ditch

Michelle steps around him into --

HOWARD’S BEDROOM
Howard matches her steps blocks her path to the door

MICHELLE
Get away from me

HOWARD

easier

Howard steps toward her
Michelle reaches down grabs a wine bottle and swings it
Howard jumps back avoids the impact

HOWARD (CONTD)
You bitch

He grabs Michelle around the neck a crazed look in his eyes

And then --
WHAM The revolver smashes Howard in the back of the head

Howard collapses forward into Michelle knocking both of them
onto the mattress leaving Michelle underneath his limp body

Nate stands over them both looking down at Michelle
NATE
You ready to deal with this problem
for good
Michelle looks up at Nate He waits for a response

She stares at him a long beat and shakes her head no

Nate turns and leaves the room as Michelle frantically
struggles to get out from under Howard’s leaden weight

Michelle finally manages to push Howard off of her She
scurries for the door

Judging by the dozen or so empty bottles on the counter
she’s been at it awhile

HOWARD
What are you doing

Michelle ignores him Howard hurries over and grabs a bottle
out of Michelle’s hand

MICHELLE
Don’t touch me

Nate saunters into the room He walks right up and holds the
revolver against Howard’s skull

NATE
I’ve just about had enough of you

HOWARD
That’s my wine

NATE
Can’t drink it if you’re dead

Howard lets go of the bottle and backs away
Nate locks eyes on Howard a chilling look on his face --

NATE (CONT’D)
You enjoy attacking women don’t

HOWARD
I didn’t attack her I would never
do that I
Howard reaches a hand out to Michelle -- she backs away from

him

HOWARD (CONTD)

Tears form in Michelle’s eyes

HOWARD
Wait no Michelle Don’t go

Nate keeps his eyes on Howard who’s kneeling on the stairs

MICHELLE (CONTD)

Nate pauses considering
Howard looks up to him with pleading eyes
Nate pushes Howard back down the stairs

HOWARD

NATE

Howard stumbles into the --

MAIN ROOM
Nate follows on his heels

NATE

HOWARD
Okay However you --

NATE
And stop talking I’ve heard enough
out of you for a lifetime So do us
all a favor And shut the fuck up

Nate sneers at Howard Howard returns an empty look --
something has snapped inside of both of them
INT HOWARD’S ROOM - LATER

Howard sits at the edge of his bed He doesn’t move an inch
There’s a feral look in his eyes

INT SMALL BEDROOM

Michelle awakens -- next to Nate -- from a bad dream Cold
sweat runs down her face She shivers

NATE
(half asleep)
You okay

MICHELLE
Yeah

She burrows into his arms He pushes her away pulls off the
covers

NATE
I gotta piss

Nate climbs out of bed and crosses to the door He unlocks
it walks out closing it behind him

Michelle hears the sound of Nate locking the door from the
outside She curls into her pillow eyes flutter closed
INT MAIN ROOM - MORNING

Howard sits at the table fiddling with the radio

Michelle walks in rubbing sleep from her eyes she scans the
room then walks into Howard’s room

A moment later she comes back in -- wide awake

MICHELLE
Where’s Nate

Howard looks up mulls over his answer

MICHELLE (CONTD)
Where is he

There’s a long beat before Howard responds --
HOWARD
Said he heard something outside

Decided to go have a look

MICHELLE
How long has he been gone

HOWARD
A couple of hours
She stares warily at Howard

MICHELLE

Think he’1ll be back soon
HOWARD

Depends on what he finds I

suppose
Michelle moves to the cupboard

HOWARD (CONTD)
I knew this was gonna happen

MICHELLE
What

Howard motions around the cellar

HOWARD
The attack Way things have been
going in the world -- growing

population dwindling resources
Too many rats in the cage Anda
bunch of politicians who only care
about getting a sound bite in the
next news cycle -- it wasn’t hard
to see we were coming to a
crossroads But that’s the problem
with people -- they’re so damn
entitled so insistent on believing
in whatever it is that they want to
be true facts be damned Try
telling them something they don’t
want to hear Might as well talk to
the wall

Michelle nods but doesn’t respond

HOWARD (CONTD)
But sometimes people need to hear
the truth

MICHELLE
Like what

HOWARD
At the bottom of everything people
are selfish and brutal We do
what’s best for ourselves We want
to pretend like it’s logic or
morality or religion But it’s not
(MORE)

HOWARD (CONTD)
It’s darker than that And if
youre in denial

Howard locks eyes on Michelle --

HOWARD (CONTD)
-if you’re in denial Michelle
then you’re in danger I know it’s
hard to face facts to admit it’s
all a frenzy of selfish and
desperate chaos But if you don’t
face those facts you’re putting
yourself in a far worse far
riskier position

Michelle breaks eye contact pulls out some food -- masking
her growing sense of unease

INT BATHROOM - LATER

Michelle washes her face at the sink She reaches for a towel
and notices splattered drops of pink on it She looks around
More drops of pink liquid remain in the bottom of the tub
Could be watered down BLOOD

She stands there frozen staring

INT MAIN ROOM

Howard is on the couch now reading He looks up as Michelle
enters

MICHELLE
What really happened

HOWARD
What do you mean

MICHELLE
Nate wouldn’t leave me down here
with you Not after what you did

HOWARD
I told you it’1ll never happen
again You made sure of that

Howard motions to the empty wine rack

HOWARD (CONTD)
Guess I should thank you
MICHELLE
(stoic)
Howard

HOWARD
Yes

MICHELLE
I can’t do it anymore

HOWARD
Can’t do what

MICHELLE
Whatever you’re going to do to me
just get it over with

HOWARD
You got it wrong Nate was trying
to He’ll be back soon You’11
see

Silent tears begin to roll down Michelle’s face

MICHELLE
You told me the whole story was a
lie Then you begged for your life
when Nate was going to make you
leave I can’t live with the
uncertainty anymore Or is that
part of the game

HOWARD
I’m sorry I lied to you earlier I
needed the keys I needed to get
out Nate was going to kill me

MICHELLE
So what you killed him first

HOWARD
Michelle I’m not going to do
anything to you I’d never hurt
you You’re like my own daughter

MICHELLE
And youre like my father He was a
lying son of a bitch

Michelle’s lips quiver she crumples against the wall

HOWARD
Stop crying I’m trying to help
you That’s all I’ve ever done

Michelle heaves Howard aches for her but knows better than
to approach

HOWARD (CONTD)
It’s going to be alright

And then -- a RUMBLE echoes from outside GRAVEL CRUNCHES
under something heavy something big

And it’s coming closer

Howard flips off the lights leaving only a weak beam of
sunlight from the tiny window at the top of the stairwell

HOWARD (CONTD)
(whispering)
Don’t make a noise
The vehicle stops above them The engine cuts out --
An unnerving silence
MICHELLE
(whispering)
What if it’s help
HOWARD
(whispering)

What if it’s not

Howard moves toward Michelle who stands in near darkness
looking up the stairwell waiting

MICHELLE
(barely audible)
Maybe it’s Nate

Howard nods as he slowly methodically moves closer

Michelle gazes at the stairwell unsure of whether to scream
for help or heave silently

HOWARD
(whispering)
If it’s Nate he’1ll knock

An eternity passes

The RUMBLE of the engine restarting breaks the silence

Michelle suddenly charges for the stairwell --

MICHELLE
Help Hel --

Howard tackles her covers her mouth
The engine cuts out again

Michelle bites Howard pulls free for a moment But he pulls
her back and they struggle across the floor

And now there’s POUNDING on the stairwell door

LOUDER and LOUDER

Michelle squirms Howard holds her down He drags her toward
a kitchen drawer and reaches into it She bites him again
but as she does so he plunges a syringe into her arm
BANG BANG BANG from the stairwell

Michelle stops struggling

BANG BANG BANG

Her eyes close

The pounding stops

As Michelle fades into unconsciousness she hears --

The engine FIRING UP The vehicle pulling away

Howard watches Michelle a sad look on his face

INT EXT MICHELLES CAR - NIGHT - (FLASHBACK)

Michelles car SQUEALS across the road

Her eyes wide in pure terror

And the car careens over the ledge the back tires catching
and flipping it It rolls to the bottom of the ditch -- all
BROKEN GLASS and BENDING METAL

Then a sudden SILENCE as it comes to a rest

And the darkness is pierced by a set of headlights pulling to
a stop on the road above

Someone climbs out of the vehicle and steps into the beams of
light Then begins climbing down the side of the embankment
INT MICHELLES CAR - CONTINUOUS

Shes upside down belted into her seat the door crushed to
her side blood gushing from her head eyes slit open in semi-
consciousness

A sudden SHRIEK from the door but it refuses to be opened

Another louder SHRIEK And again And again The door is
slowly pried open

And finally -- the door gives swings open revealing --

HOWARD standing above Michelle looking down at her The
expression on his face is hard to read

HOWARD

Dont worry Everythings going to

be alright
As Howard reaches down for Michelle she slips into
unconsciousness
INT SMALL BEDROOM
Michelle wakes up
Alone on the mattress where it all started
She gets to her feet crosses the room and pulls on the door
It’s locked She leans in examines the deadbolt lock above

the door handle

There are two flathead screws facing her She touches them
with her fingers an idea forming

Michelle bangs on the door She waits

MICHELLE
Come on I gotta use the bathroom

Footsteps approach The lock clicks The door opens

HOWARD
Morning

Michelle walks by him without saying another word

INT MAIN ROOM - MORNING

Howard sits at the table He doesn’t notice as Michelle slips
a butter knife into her pocket

Michelle opens the cupboard reaches to the very back and
pulls out five bottles of wine

Howard sees them lined up on the counter

HOWARD
Where’d those come from

MICHELLE
Nate had me hide some bottles Said
we should save them for special
occasions

HOWARD
And what’s so special about today

MICHELLE
It’s my birthday

Michelle starts opening the wine
Howard steps over takes the bottle from her
HOWARD
Still kind of early for that
wouldn’t you say
Howard looks down at the bottle in his hand clearly tempted
MICHELLE
You got some big plans that I don’t

know about

She puts her hand back on the bottle Her fingers slightly
overlap Howard’s fingers He lets go of the bottle

Michelle finishes opening it She pours herself some
Howard puts his hand over his empty glass

HOWARD
I’m good

MICHELLE
Gonna make me drink alone

Howard keeps his hand over the glass fighting temptation

MICHELLE (CONTD)
Come on One drink That’s it
HOWARD
Okay One drink And only because
it’s your birthday

Howard moves his hand away Michelle pours him a full glass

INT MAIN ROOM - LATER

The second bottle has been opened Michelle and Howard sit at
the table

MICHELLE
I don’t really like this one

HOWARD
Open another

Michelle crosses bringing her glass with her She grabs
another bottle off the counter and opens it

While Howard isn’t looking she pours her full glass down the
drain

Michelle stumbles nearly falls on her way back to the table

HOWARD (CONTD)
Careful Maybe you’ve had too much

MICHELLE
Or maybe I haven’t had enough

She pours herself a full glass and tops off Howard
HOWARD
Normally you don’t mix Chardonnay
and Shiraz But hell
He tastes a bit

HOWARD (CONTD)
Makes a half decent rose

Michelle offers a smile clinks glasses with Howard

INT MAIN ROOM - LATER

Michelle is on the couch eyes barely open There’s a fourth
bottle on the table in front of Howard

MICHELLE
(slurring)
I miss beer Wine’s too strong

HOWARD
Well if you didn’t guzzle it down
so quickly

MICHELLE
And I miss Pepsi and Starbucks and
lasagna and chocolate chip cookie
dough

HOWARD
We have some freeze dried lasagna
Somewhere

MICHELLE
Uh huh

She’s fading Her eyes close and she slumps on the couch
HOWARD
Alright missy I think it’s time

for a nap

Howard stands a bit wobbly himself He walks over to
Michelle and pulls her to her feet She MOANS softly

Howard takes Michelle to her room keeping her on a more or
less straight line
INT MICHELLE’S ROOM

Howard sets Michelle down on her bed She rolls over and
curls into a ball

HOWARD
There you go Nothing a bit of
sleep won’t sort out

He gently pulls a blanket over her as she sinks into the bed

Howard stands up and watches her for a moment -- a soft
wistful look on his face --

Then he reaches into her purse which lies next to the bed He
digs around pulls out her wallet

Michelle watches him anxiously through half-closed eyes

Howard pulls out her driver’s license stares at it a beat
then tosses on the mattress next to her
HOWARD (CONTD)
(ice cold)

Hope you hid some more wine Looks

like we’ll be doing this again in

six months For your real birthday

Michelle’s eyes pop wide open

Howard turns and walks out

INT MAIN ROOM

Howard closes the door to Michelle’s room and locks it with
his key

INT MICHELLE’S ROOM

Michelle lies on the mattress completely still eyes wide
open -- sober and aware

She slips out of bed -- in complete control of her senses

Michelle pulls the butter knife from her back pocket and
approaches the lock

The two flathead screws face Michelle The butter knife is
just thin enough to fit into the grooves

She goes to work loosening the screws

INT MAIN ROOM

Howard sits at the table and pours himself another glass of
wine He takes a big gulp and shakes his head disappointedly
INT MICHELLE’S ROOM - LATER

The screws have been removed from the deadbolt Michelle has
her ear to the door listening to --

INT MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Howard -- face down on the table -- SNORING A fifth bottle
of wine is half empty in front of him

The lock on Michelle’s door pops out of its hole And the
door swings open

Michelle hurries into the room and begins sifting through
Howard’s pockets

She finds the keys and crosses to the metal door unlocks it

Michelle pulls open the door and finds -- the HAZMAT SUIT
along with the gun and a set of car keys

Michelle pockets the car keys tucks the gun in her waistband
and grabs the suit

INT BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Michelle pulls on the hazmat suit She checks herself in the
mirror and then exits

INT MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Michelle walks by a passed out Howard heads up the
stairwell

INT STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Michelle reaches the top of the stairwell and goes through
the key ring

BUT THE KEY TO THE DOOR IS MISSING

She frantically goes through the keys again Still not there
She tries other keys but none of them work

INT MAIN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Michelle returns to the bottom of the stairs and scans the
room looking for the key

Howard stirs readjusts his head but clearly he’s beginning
to wake up

Michelle is growing frantic She reaches down and slides the
carpet over revealing the trap door She pulls open the door
and climbs down into the --

CRAWL SPACE
It’s only a couple of feet high The well is at one dark end

Michelle glances around finds what she’s looking for --
cracks of DAYLIGHT

She moves toward the light doing her best not to scrape up
the suit

At the far end of the crawl space she finds an old vent that
has been boarded over

She pulls at the boards but they’re solid So she rolls over
on her back feet to the boards and kicks as hard as she
can

THUMP But the boards hold

INT MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Howard stirs lifts his head at the sound of Michelle kicking

freezes Nothing she has experienced yet compares to the
horror in her eyes now --
MICHELLE’S POV
Mask FOGGED but through it -- NATE face down in a puddle

to wash away the blood skull fragments and brain matter

shock

barely breathing

HOWARD (0S)

Michelle jumps at the sound of her name ADRENALINE rushes
through her veins

HOWARD (0S) (CONT’D)

THE WOODS -- fifty yards away
THE BARN -- twenty-five yards away
THE FARM HOUSE -- five yards away

HOWARD (CONTD)

His voice just around the corner now

Michelle rushes to the farm house’s back door her feet
churning up the muddy ground beneath her

he makes for the house

Michelle spins -- the gun tumbles out of her slippery glove
hits the ground near Howard’s feet

and picks up the gun shoves it in his pocket

MICHELLE
No shit

Michelle flings aside a silverware tray -- she’s done with
butter knives She rips open another drawer

INT HALLWAY - DAY

Down the long corridor Howard closes in -- watching Michelle
move frantically in the kitchen with her back to him

HOWARD
I didn’t have a choice You didn’t
know Nate like I did He was
dangerous I did it for us

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Howard now visible in the hallway behind her He moves
slowly talks calmly

HOWARD
He was going to kill me I had to
protect myself

Michelle still rooting through drawers looking for
something anything she could use as a weapon

MICHELLE
You coming to finish the job

Howard steps into the kitchen

HOWARD
You don’t have to love me You
don’t even have to like me but
please Don’t leave me I don’t
want to be alone I’11 never hurt
you You can trust me

MICHELLE
Trust you You’re a murderer

HOWARD
It was self-defense

MICHELLE

Michelle stops searching She stands at the counter frozen
but stays facing the other way

MICHELLE’S POV

A refection in the rain-coated window --

Howard approaches her from behind

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Howard’s close enough to touch her He reaches out

HOWARD
I won’t let you leave
Michelle spins -- a butcher’s knife gripped in her hand
MICHELLE

You can’t stop me

The blade slices throw the wet blanket that covers Howard --
he stumbles falls to his ass taking the knife with him

Michelle bolts toward the rear stairway

Howard looks down a big slice through the wet blanket but
the blade only grazed his chest

Howard pulls the gun from his pocket as he gets to his feet

INT FARM HOUSE - BACK STAIRWELL - DAY

Michelle races up the back stairs A cumbersome task in the
oversized hazmat suit

She glances over her shoulder
Howard starts up the stairs behind her revolver at his side

Michelle trips over the top step stumbles steadies herself
on a large cabinet at the top of the landing

It wobbles against the wall

Howard’s halfway up the stairs behind her

She tugs hard on the cabinet It rocks more She pulls on it
again It rocks further One more huge pull --

Tipping point --

The cabinet crashes down the stairwell forcing Howard to
retreat back down the stairs

INT FARM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

Michelle hurries into the master bedroom

A cordless phone sits on the bedside table She rips it out
of its cradle -- but the battery’s dead

Michelle throws the phone Moves to the window -- a two story
drop to the ground below

Her eyes lock on the yellow pickup parked against the barn
She opens the window wide

Rain blows in pattering off the carpeted floors as Michelle
leans out and looks down at the muddy ground below

INT FARM HOUSE - MAIN STAIRWAY - DAY

Howard marches up the main stairway gun still in hand

INT FARM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
Howard stalks into the bedroom He sees the open window

He crosses the room looks out the window -- no sign of
Michelle Howard turns back looks around the room --

The closet door is closed

The bathroom door is half open

Howard slowly approaches the closet --
He rips open the door -- it’s empty
Howard walks toward the bathroom

He pushes the door all the way open

He notices the shower curtain pulled across the tub

He steps into the --

BATHROOM
Howard reaches out he grips the shower curtain --
He pulls it aside and finds --

MICHELLE a bottle of foaming tile cleaner in her hand She
sprays the cleaner into Howard’s face

He drops the revolver as his hands fly up to protect his
eyes but the damage is done He’s momentarily blinded

Michelle lunges for the revolver Howard grabs for her but
can’t get a grip on the slippery hazmat suit

Michelle comes up gun in hand She backs toward the door as
she gets her finger through the trigger

Howard wipes his eyes with the wet blanket that’s still
wrapped around his head

He squints wipes some more He manages to open them a bit
Takes a moment to focus --

Michelle stands in the bathroom doorway gun trained on him
Howard puts his hands up

HOWARD
It’s not easy killing someone
Pulling that trigger was the
hardest thing I’ve ever done

Howard seems to get lost in a moment of thought

HOWARD (CONTD)
First real feeling I’ve had since
they took my daughter

Howard wipes his eyes again It’s hard to tell if the water
dripping from them is from the cleaning solution or from
tears

MICHELLE
Spare me your bullshit I know you
never had a kid I also know you
killed your wife Nate told me

Howard stands there a forlorn look on his face

HOWARD
And you believed him Why

MICHELLE
He didn’t run me off the road He
didn’t kidnap me and lock me in a
cellar He didn’t attack me

HOWARD
I saved you

MICHELLE
Stop with the fucking lies You’re
out here walking around breathing
the air You seem fine I mean
except for the fact that you’re
batshit crazy

HOWARD
It’s the rain The rain must’ve
washed that crap from the air

MICHELLE
You always have an answer

Howard stands there a beat a tortured look on his face --

HOWARD
Three years ago I was driving home
from a party My wife was in the
car with me I was drunk I lost
control and hit a tree My wife
didn’t make it

His eyes water up

HOWARD (CONTD)

The state claimed I was an unfit
father They fought to take my
daughter Lily away Nate testified
against me -- he lied saying he’d
seen me hit her All because he
thought I owed him some money My
in-laws got custody Took Lily with
them to DC and I haven’t seen her
since Not sure I ever will again

Howard takes a small step toward her

HOWARD (CONTD)
I can’t lose you too

Michelle raises the gun to his face

MICHELLE
Stay the fuck away from me

Another small step

HOWARD
You don’t have it in you

Michelle starts to lower the gun
Howard smiles as he takes another step

HOWARD (CONTD)
It’s going to be okay

MICHELLE
I know it will

Michelle PULLS THE TRIGGER --

A bullet RIPS through Howard’s knee He collapses screaming
to the floor

Howard rolls around in agonizing pain

Michelle turns and runs out of the room

INT FARM HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Michelle sprints toward the front stairs

She slows when she sees -- the entire stairway wall is filled
with a collection of framed family photos from over the years
-- different shots of Howard a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN and a YOUNG
GIRL

Michelle pauses stares at them a million thoughts rushing
through her head

Howard’s SCREAMS snap her out of it She continues down the
steps

EXT FARM HOUSE - DAY

Michelle runs out the front door

She sprints across the muddy yard past Nate’s body She

reaches the truck and pulls open the door She grabs the keys
from a pocket on the inside of the hazmat suit

Howard’s voice drifts out the open window upstairs

HOWARD
Michelle be careful

Michelle starts to get in the truck looks over her shoulder
and sees the rotting pig flesh in the pen

She climbs in the truck and closes the door

EXT PICKUP - CONTINUOUS
The engine ROARS to life --
Michelle stomps on the gas --

Mud flies across the yard as the tires spin

INT PICKUP - DAY

The truck bounces along the pothole filled driveway After a
couple hundred yards Michelle reaches the road

She pulls out onto the asphalt and floors the accelerator as
rain SPLATTERS on the windshield

She reaches down and turns on the old radio scans the dial
but only comes up with STATIC Maybe it’s busted

Michelle turns her eyes back to the remote farm road as she
pulls up to an intersection

A sign directs her to CHICAGO 25 MILES

EXT PICKUP - DAY

The truck turns onto the two lane highway in the direction of
CHICAGO The road is eerily empty

INT PICKUP - MOMENTS LATER

Michelle comes upon a filling station She pulls in but it’s
closed

EXT FILLING STATION - CONTINUOUS

Michelle climbs out of the truck and walks up to the filling
station door looks in knocks

She walks around to the side of the building and sees --
TWO PAY PHONES

Michelle moves to the first phone lifts the receiver
There’s no dial tone She dials 9-1-1 anyway Nothing
happens

She picks up the receiver on the second phone -- same
problem She flips the lever trying to get something Her
gut is churning by this point

Michelle drops the receiver She heads back to the truck and
climbs in

INT PICKUP - LATER

The rain has stopped Michelle has driven out of the storm

She speeds up a hill passes a road sign -- CHICAGO 10
MILES

The road is still completely empty Just Michelle the pickup
and Michelle’s growing sense of foreboding

The truck has almost reached the top of the hill It’s clear
there will be a vantage point as she crests Michelle’s
anticipation grows

Her heart thumps

Her eyes widen

EXT PICKUP - CONTINUOUS

FRONT ANGLE

The truck crests the hill It slows pulling forward into a --

CLOSE UP ON

MICHELLE -- not breathing a look of horror on her face
Shock doesn’t even begin to explain what she’s going through
MICHELLE’S POV

THE DOWNTOWN CHICAGO SKYLINE - reduced to smoking rubble

INT PICKUP - DAY

Michelle stares out at the decimation Her lips quiver Her
heart pounds

She slowly pulls down the mask on the hazmat suit before
taking a breath

SMASH TO BLACK
ROLL CREDITS
