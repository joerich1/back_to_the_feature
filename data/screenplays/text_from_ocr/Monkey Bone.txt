FADE IN

MAIN CREDITS ROLL

over BLACK SCREEN with PORTENTOUS SPOOKY MUSIC underneath Just as
the
music reaches its crescendo we hear a simian SCREECH

A BUCK-TOOTHED CARTOON MONKEY swings past on a vine TITLE WIPES IN
with
him

MONKEYBONE (tm)
in
FREUD CHICKEN

TIGHT CLOSEUP - STANLEY (ANIMATED)

A POCKETWATCH swings back and forth in FG Gaping at it is a goofy
bespectacled CARTOON CHARACTER sucking his thumb as his EYES move
back

and forth After a moment the LEFT EYE freezes in place - but the
right

eye keeps going back and forth with the watch

SHRINKS VOICE (os)
Back Stanleyyoure going backback to when
it all began Are you going back yet Come on
get back ve havent got all day

Now BOTH EYES are locked in place The patient is hypnotized
INT SCHOOLROOM - DAY (ANIMATED)

A squat lumpy TEACHER MISS HUDLAPP is straining to erase the
Gettysburg Address which is written along the very top of the
blackboard Theres an obtrusive rhythmic BANGING noice in BG

STANLEY (V0O)
It was third grade The teacher was Miss
Hudlapp She was kinda squat and lumpy - she
smelled funny - but she was kind

MISS HUDLAPP
CLASS
(turning around suddenly)
How many times have I told you In this class we
do not pound tenpenny nails into Stanleys head

REVERSE ANGLE - ON STANLEY

Hapless ten-year-old STANLEY still goofy and bespectacled in his
front-row desk NAILS stick out of his head The FOUR MEAN KIDS poised
around him lower their hammers and return to their seats grumbling

A dreamy SMILE crosses STANLEYs face as he gazes at MISS HUDLAPP

STANLEY (V0O)
You know how some teachers have those kind of
flaps on their arms - those big sacks of limp
flab that like dangle

As MISS HUDLAPP pulls her sweater off TWO MASSIVE ARM-FLAPS - fifty
gallons of flab apiece - SPILL OUT and SMACK INTO THE FLOOR

MISS HUDDLAPP claps two erasers together kicking up a cloud of dust
Young STANLEY watches transfixed by her massive ARM FLAPS We TRACK
IN
on the gigantic ARM FLAPS as they swing hypnotically back and forth
with a loud SLAP each time they collide

STANLEY (V0O)
It sounds weirdbut for some reason as I
watched those big old flaps of hers I began to
feelwelloddly

Now we TRACK IN on the mesmerized STANLEY A SONG comes up underneath
Donna Summer I FEEL LOVE

STANLEY (V0O)
aroused
(beat)
And then the horror began

DOINK STANLEY looks down at his LAP in horror The boys and girls
around him are pointing and tittering

Grimacing in embarrassment he discreetly places a heavy TEXTBOOK onto
his lap suppressing the bulge in his pants But SPROING - the BOOK
goes flying across the room The BULGE is fighting back

The kids DUCK AND COVER beneath their desks as STANLEY slams a STACK
of

textbooks onto his lap Its no use - the WHOLE STACK goes flying and
BOOKS come raining down on the entire class Now MISS HUDLAPP is
staring

directly at him

MISS HUDLAPP
Young man Whats that in your lap

She marches toward him STANLEY pulls his BACKPACK over his lap

STANLEY (VO)
It was useless Like putting a baseball cap on
the Washington Monument And thenall at once
there he was

The BACKPACK bucks and wriggles as if something inside is trying to
GET
OUT And then - with a flourish of rousing disco strings - IT DOES

STANLEY (V0O)
Monkeybone

The libidinous cartoon monkey BURSTS OUT of the backpack POINTS at
MISS
HUDLAPP - and announces in his Barry White baritone

MONKEYBONE
Oooo-o0o-ooh baby I love your way

KC and the SUNSHINE BAND comes up underneath as MONKEYBONE DANCES to
the

front of the class He grabs MISS HUDLAPP by the hands and begins
dancing The Bump with her ARM FLAPS Butt left WHAP Butt right
WHAP

The KIDS are bug-eyed - agog With each WHAP their little heads turn
back and forth as if theyre watching a nude tennis match

INT SCREENING ROOM - ON AUDIENCE (LIVE-ACTION)

A roomful of LIVE HUMANS watching the cartoon heads turning in sync
with the kids onscreen TV-INDUSTRY HIPSTERS AD EXECS MANUFACTURERS
REPStheyre all guests at this sneak preview of the Monkeybone
show

and theyre LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY

In the midst of the crowd is a handsome young couple JULIE McELROY
and

STU MILEY JULIEs a research scientist brainy professional
abnormally well-adjusted - and pretty enough that shed be
intimidating

if it werent for a prominent goofy streak

STU is the one guy in the auditorium who isnt laughing at the cartoon
on the screen In fact hes solemn as a judge - peering nervously
around to see how the rest of the audience is responding

Why Because hes the cartoonist who created the characters on screen
In his looks (gangly disheveled) and manner (sardonic self-
deprecating) hes the obvious model for the character of STANLEY

INT CLASSROOM (ANIMATED)

As the monkey dance continues we ZOOM IN on the mortified face of
LITTLE STANLEY His eyes begin doing the familiar HYPNO-SWIRL

INT SHRINKS OFFICE (ANIMATED)

A CUCKOO pops out of a wall clock ADULT STANLEYS THUMB pops out of
his

mouth He awakens from his trance in a cold sweat

STANLEY
How about it Doc Can you help me

SHRINK
Not overnight These imaginary monkey cases take
time I vould estimateroughly

On the desk is a CATALOGUE open to a two-page spread depicting a 40-
foot CABIN CRUISER NEW FOR SUMMER ONLY 22999995 With his free
hand the SHRINK is working a CALCULATOR

SHRINK
Twelve years and three months ought to do it

The SHRINK hustles STANLEY to the door and shakes his hand
STANLEY
One question doc - what did you mean when you
said imaginary

SHRINK
All in good time my boy All in good time

The SHRINK shoves STANLEY out and slams the door behind him Two
beats
Then he doubles over WEEPING with LAUGHTER

SHRINK
Vot a crackpot Monkey on ze back - HAH ROLL
OUT ZE WACKY WAGON

Now he notices a BACKPACK which STANLEY has left on the couch It
TWITCHES slightly - of its own free will

VOICE IN BACKPACK
Imaginary huh You quack

EXT SHRINKS BUILDING (ANIMATED)

A WINDOW shatters The SHRINK comes hurtling out MONKEYBONE STRADDLES
HIM like Slim Pickens riding an H-bomb hootin and hollerin all the
way down to the street

SPLAT A gob of gore hits STANLEY in the face as he exits the
building
He kneels on the sidewalk - finding a PIPE and a GOATEE

STANLEY
Aw Monkeybone At this rate Ill never find a
good shrink

MONKEYBONE
Those guys are a waste of money Ill show you
how to stop sucking your thumb

MONKEYBONE sticks his thumb in his butt as he and STANLEY toddle off
into the sunset

INT SCREENING ROOM - THAT MOMENT

STANDING O from the crowd as the cartoon ends and the lights come up
HERB an all-purpose sidekick type appears at the podium

HERB

at the adoring crowd

INT LOBBY - HALF-HOUR LATER - NIGHT
STU working his way through a crowd of well-wishers and FANS

He wanders across the room finds JULIE deep in conversation with a
bunch of other GUESTS and pulls her aside

INT ALCOVE - OFF LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

He gives up trying to explainpulls her close and kisses her For a
moment they completely forget about the party in the next room

Then HERB appears behind them trying to catch STUs eye as he waits
for
the clinch to break up Finally he pries them apart

HERB
Sorry Julie - wont be a minute Now Stu - I

ought to talk to these guys -

STU

HERB
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have

Lamborghinis Champagne for mouthwash when you

STU

Tonights the night Herb Tonights the night

He nods toward JULIE whos at the open bar grabbing two glasses of
punch HERB realizes a proposal is in the works

HERB

her saying yes to me

HERB

JULIEs over by the punchbowl She sees the two boys staring at her
conspiratorially - MAKES A FACE at them as she waves back

HERB
Okay then If I get you out of here - you pop
the question - tonight Or else Get me

STU nods gravely
EXT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

STU JULIE and HERB in the parking lot A small safari of FLUNKIES is
loading enormous boxes full of MONKEYBONE JUNK into STUs beat-up car

stuffed dolls action figures board games lunchboxes beach towels

team jackets and more STU groans at the sight of it

HERB
Theyre just prototypestake em home and look
at em before you say no
(scanning the streets)
If you could just hold on a minute or two were
expecting a couple more trucks

STU GLOWERS at HERB as he opens the car door for JULIE
HERB
Okay okay Youre a beautiful couple Go

INT CAR - NIGHT - MOVING

STU backs out of his space The small parking lot is full of DELIVERY
TRUCKS from would-be merchandisers - all too large for the spaces
theyre parked in STU has to keep backing up because the exit lanes
are

blocked Its like negotiating a labyrinth

STU
Look at this He wont let us leave

JULIE
Who

STU
The monkey Hes everywhere Hell take over
both our lives if we let him

JULIE
Stu - stop it That monkey is good luck You
thought him up and everybody loves him and
hes probably going to make you rich So relax
Enjoy it

STU
Im trying Its weird thats all I never had
any good luck until I met youwhat if its
all just another bad dream

JULIE
Whats the bad part

STU
I might wake up

JULIE
(laughing taking his hand)

If you do Ill be right there beside you So
face it Youre just going to have to be happy

STU
I am happy It just so happens this is the
happiest night of my life

He says it so solemnly that she cracks up After a moment he joins in

EXT PARKING LOT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
A PLASTIC BANNER stretches between two poles on either side of the
entry
to the lot It shows MONKEYBONE in a typical languorous pose

Its His World We Just Live in It
MONKEYBONE
Sunday Nights This Fall

TWO GUYS on EXTENSION LADDERS are taking the sign down as STUS CAR
idles at the exit below Theres a strong wind tonight and one guy
LOSES HOLD of his end of the banner just as he gets it detached

INT CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

As STU pulls into the intersection he sees a DELIVERY TRUCK
approaching

in the opposite lane with a cardboard likeness of MONKEYBONE mounted
atop the cab He chuckles

STU
That damn monkey is everywh--

Suddenly his view of the street DISAPPEARS The MONKEYBONE BANNER has
fallen DIRECTLY ACROSS HIS WINDSHIELD like a huge SHROUD All he can
see is a great grinning MONKEY FACE

JULIE SCREAMS STU SCREAMS Unable to see he slams on the brakes and
JERKS THE WHEEL RIGHT

Off screen HORNS BLARING TIRES SQUEALING The horrible crunch of
METAL
ON METAL

But Stus car comes to a halt untouched After a moment he opens his
eyesand JULIE opens hers

STU
Did we just - hit something

JULIE
I dont think so

STU
Are you okay

She thinks it over nods STU takes a moment to catch his breath then
opens the door gingerly A HORN BLARES as a car speeds past in the
opposite lane nearly taking STUs door off He jumps back inside
waits opens the door again

EXT INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT
His eyes widen in horror as he steps out to survey the scene The
asphalt is strewn with MONKEYBONE MERCHANDISE - stuffed dolls games
lunchboxes SKID MARKS show where the TRUCK which was carrying all
this

SWERVED

and slammed into the rear of a BUICK REGAL pinning it up against a
TELEPHONE POLE STU races up to the Buick Its front end is mashed up
like an accordion but the occupants - a couple of TEENAGERS dressed
for

the prom - seem to be okay

STU
Hey Are you guys all right in there

TEENAGE GIRL
Were fine

STU
That stupid monkey banner It fell on my
windshield - it practically killed us all
(to JULIE)
God Julie if anything had happened to you -

JULIE
Im fine baby Were all okay We were lucky

STU
Id better go report this

He spots a PHONE BOOTH and starts across the street On the way there
he

plucks a STUFFED MONKEYBONE DOLL off the pavement and CHOKES IT with
both hands

JULIE stays behind with the prom kids The TEENAGE BOY in his tux is
glassy-eyed miserable beyond description

JULIE
Dads car

The BOY begins to SOB softly JULIE nods in sympathy

Then EVERYONE WINCES The air is full of a horrible CREAKING noise
like nails on a blackboard

TEENAGE GIRL
What was that Did you hear that

The horrible CREAKING NOISE continues JULIE turns Behind her the
TELEPHONE POLE that the car slammed into is beginning to TEETER Then
it
TOPPLES Directly toward

JULIE
sTu

ON STU - IN PHONE BOOTH
He sees JULIE running toward him and holds up a single finger

STU
Operator I want to report an accident

Finally he glances up - just in time to see the TELEPHONE POLE coming
down toward the phone booth like a gigantic sledgehammer His eyes
widen The STUFFED MONKEYBONE slips from his grasp

CLOSEUP - MONKEYBONE

A HORRIBLE CRASH SCREAMS CAMERA ZEROES IN on the MONKEYBONE DOLL
which

STU was holding surrounded by broken glass its face twisted into an
insane almost macabre grin

The screen fades to PITCH BLACK for a few secondsuntil we hear a
DISTANT SIREN and an IMAGE comes swimming into focus

STUS POV ON JULIE

Hes in the back of an ambulance with PARAMEDICS all around him
working feverishly JULIE hovers above him holding his hand

JULIE
Stu Im here baby Its me Its Julie I love
you Youre gonna be okay baby I promise -

All at once he seems to be RECEDING from JULIE and the others - as if
SINKING THROUGH the bottom of the stretcher and BEYOND - through the
floor of the ambulance JULIEs voice grows weaker more distant

JULIE (VO)
Im here baby I wont leave you

And then all trace of the ambulance is gone and hes floating down
through some strange LIMBO surrounded by the silhouettes of billowing
SHROUDS with the sound of BIRDS CALLING all around him

An AWFUL MECHANICAL RATCHETING NOISE fills the soundtrack STUs eyes
close - and when they reopen he finds himself in

EXT TROLLEY - MOVING
A tiny ROLLER-COASTER CAR descends from dense clouds down the length
of

an impossibly long and rickety METAL TRACK The track leads through a
vast black VOID

to a tiny ISLAND floating in the darknessan island that looks
not
unlike a disembodied FIST

And as the car draws closer the fist begins to OPEN - tulip-like -
turning into a HAND with a full-sized TOWN nestled in its palm In
the

town CARNIVAL LIGHTS begin to glitter MUSIC begins to tinkle

EXT PLATFORM - NIGHT

The car - a one-passenger job with a CARTOON ANIMAL FACE on its prow -
stops with a lurch STU steps out onto a fog-shrouded TRAIN STATION
PLATFORM Before he knows it the little car DEPARTS behind him Hes
stranded - alone

STU
Hello Anybody - Am I dead
(beat)
PLEASE ID LIKE TO KNOW IF IM DEAD

Off in the fog is a big wheeled CART with the sign PSYCHOLOGICAL
BAGGAGE CLAIM There STU finds two SUITCASES and a BACKPACK He
examines the TAGS They all belong to him

He sits on the edge of the cart opens a SUITCASE and pulls out

A bagged copy of Marvel Comics Conan the Barbarian 1

- An 8mm reel of highlights from Ray Harryhausens Jason and the
Argonauts with swordfighting skeletons on the box cover

- A SPIRAL NOTEBOOK its cover labelled STU M - GEOGRAPHY its
inside pages covered with drawings of dinosaurs and airplanes

- Transparent plastic models of THE VISIBLE MAN and his mate THE
VISIBLE WOMAN with a couple of spare organs that young STU never

quite found a place for

- A vinyl LP of BREADS GREATEST HITS which STU quickly slips back
into the suitcase lest anyone see it

As he gathers his bags he hears odd SQUEAKS and CHITTERING

RACCOON (0os)
Carry your bags mister

A STRANGE FURRY CREATURE pops out from beneath the platform and yanks
on

STUs pants leg It looks like a raccoon but its FLAT - an animated
pelt Before STU has time to let out a yell a FLAT SNAKESKIN comes
slithering out from beneath the baggage cart

SNAKE
Cigars mister Genuine Coobans

STU looks down and sees a SQUASHED RABBIT humping his leg

RABBIT
Wanna meet my sister

These bordertown types are known as ROADKILL and theyre sporting the
tire tracks to prove it STU SCREAMS shakes them off and RUNS

EXT DARK TOWN GATES - NIGHT

A long stone STAIRWAY leads to decorative wrought-iron GATES SHADOWY
CARVED SPHINXES sit on either side As STU races up the steps a
sputtering NEON SIGN comes to life overhead

D RK TOWN

A FANFARE BLOWS as the creaky gates begin to part A SPOTLIGHT hits
the

SPHINXES - and they COME TO LIFE They rise up on their hind legs put
on boater hats One of them blows a note on a kazoo

SINGING SPHINXES
Weeeewelcome you to Dark Town
And while youre in your coma
This odd amusement park-town
Will be your Home Sweet Homa -

STU bolts THROUGH THE GATES with the ROADKILL TRIO right on his
heels
The indignant SPHINXES exchange a look of outrage

EXT DARK TOWN - MIDWAY - NIGHT

Its a carny town a tourist trap seedy and nightmarish Despite the
festive trappings theres something off about it - an air of neglect
and decrepitude - as if theyd tried to turn Alcatraz into Disneyland
and given up halfway through

STU looks back and sees the ROADKILL gaining on him He spots a small
group of OTHER HUMANS
STU
Help me Please Theres animals They -

The humans just YAWN Theyre COMA VICTIMS just like STU He ditches
one of his SUITCASES as the ROADKILL come after him

VOICE
Pony ride Mister

He turns and spots a helpful-looking fellow in a COWBOY OUTFIT The
COWBOY is in fact a CENTAUR - rider and mount rolled into one

The characters who run this place - the BARKERS TICKET-TAKERS and
RIDE

OPERATORS - are all weird HYBRIDS part human part ANIMAL They could
be the ancient Gods of some primitive culture - reduced to working as
street entertainers in this ramshackle resort town

STU pinballs down the street bouncing from one shock to another

JOE CAMEL doing community service as a STREET SWEEPER -

recognizes STU much to his horror

HEAD 1

HEAD 3

Reduced to babbling hysteria STU ducks into the nearest building
Above
the door an ANIMATED NEON SIGN shows a happy boozer lifting his
martini

glass then falling over flat on his back at which point his eyes are
replaced by the traditional cartoon Xs This is the COMA BAR

INT COMA BAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

STU bursts in flattens himself against the wall as the ROADKILL
skitter
past outside Hes given them the slip He looks around

The bars a weird melange of styles COMA VICTIMS ride around in
wheelchairs refurbished as BUMPER CARS drinking cocktails from IV
bottler A four-armed ELEPHANT GOD is at the Mighty Wurlitzer while a
MERMAID VOCALIST in a half-shell belts out the wistful lyrics of
Johnny

Mercers DREAM And over at the BAR

BULL (os)

Out of breath STU edges toward the bar as the BARTENDER BULL turns
away to grab a fresh glass

STU
Chasing me - animals - horrible -

BULL

STU GAGS BULL is a full-fledged MINOTAUR body of a man head of a
BULL His features are CUBIST - weirdly squashed over to one side

the

bar on which a panicked man in pajamas is trying to run barefoot
through a great sticky SEA OF MOLASSES

BULL
I told you its the land of nightmares Same on
every channelall the stuff people dream
after they have the extra anchovies

He changes channels with a remote Now we see a guy falling through
midair arms and legs flailing falling falling falling

STU
Jeez it all looks like bad late-night cable

BULL
Sad commentary huh

Now a small muffled VOICE speaks from the area of STUS BACKPACK

DISEMBODIED VOICE (os)
Bull huh Thats cute Whats your last name
- Shit

BULL
(turning angrily to STU)
I beg your pardon

STU
I didnt say anything

VOICE (os)
Nice face Lemme guess You were in a bullfight
with a Mack Truck

STU claps both hands over his mouth to prove hes not the one talking
BULL glowers at him snorting STEAM out of both nostrils

STU
I was uh just getting ready to leave

BULL
Yo Jumbo We got us some kind of ventriloquist
here
The ELEPHANT GOD from the Wurlitzer organ comes lumbering over

VOICE (0s)
Well hello sailor Get a lot of dates with

BULL and JUMBO rear back to PUNCH STUS LIGHTS OUT Hes saying his
prayers when his BACKPACK begins to BULGE and QUIVER - and a SMALL
FURRY

BEAST pops out CACKLING HIS HEAD OFF

MONKEYBONE

(pointing at STU)

On him HIYA BOSS
BULL and JUMBO back off STUNNED The monkey grabs STUS FACE and
plants
a big wet SMOOCH right on his NOSE STU SCREAMS
CUT TO
INT HOSPITAL ROOM - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

TIGHT ON an EEG monitor Theres a sudden BLIP on the readout

NURSE
Just a spike maam It happens Its perfectly
natural with coma patients

JULIE
Im a doctor too I know this mans brain -

JULIE strokes STUs limp hand Hes COMATOSE cocooned in a tangle of
wires and tubes His head and shoulders are heavily bandaged Hes
hooked up to as much machinery as you can cram into one room

DOCTOR
Go home Doctor Rest Come back when you can do
us some good

INT HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

Dead on her feet JULIE stumbles toward the exit As shes leaving she
passes the WAITING ROOM -

WOMANS VOICE
Julie
She turns and sees an older colleague from work - ALICE - waiting in
the
doorway Hovering right behind ALICE is HERB And behind him -

It appears that almost everyone in the waiting room is a friend of
JULIE

and STUs Disheveled and groggy they rouse themselves and make their
way over to JULIEs side Shes overcome with emotion

INT STU and JULIES HOUSE - ENTRY - NIGHT

The sound of the key in the lock is met by INSANE BARKING JULIE and
ALICE enter and are met by BUSTER the pet basset - jumping and
yipping

like crazy after 24 hours without food or human company

ALICE
Now dont pick a fight Im staying over

JULIE
Oh poor Buster He hasnt been fed in a day and
a half Let me get some food

ALICE kneels to play with the dog She hears a sudden GASP from the
kitchen JULIE is standing by the open refrigerator wearing an
absolutely stricken expression

INT KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

ALICE finds JULIE holding a bottle of champagne - Veuve Clicquot La
Grande Dame 1989 - all wrapped up in a bow and ribbon

ALICE
Special occasion

JULIE
I dont know I guess it was

She bursts into tears ALICE sits her down at the kitchen table and
takes the champagne from her

ALICE
Dont get all poignant Were keeping this
bottle on ice When he comes around youre going
to need it

INT BATHROOM - LATER - NIGHT

A limp JULIE soaking in a steamy tub one arm dangling over the side
On

the vanity is a framed PHOTO STRIP four poses for a dollar In the
first three STU and JULIE are making outrageously goony faces In the
fourth they imitate the stern-faced farm couple from American Gothic
She gazes at it for a long long time Eventually she smiles
INT SECOND BEDROOMSTUDIO - NIGHT

OPEN on two PHOTOS mounted in a single frame On the left BUSTER
KEATON droopy-eyed in his familiar porkpie hat and vest On the
right

a Photoshopped image of BUSTER THE BASSETT HOUND in the same pose
also

wearing Keatons hat and vest

These photos are on the wall of the cramped room which serves as STUs
studio and JULIEs office MONKEYBONE STRIPS are scattered across the
drafting table ALICE is making up the sofa as a guest bed

As shes hanging her coat in the closet she comes across an ACRYLIC
CANVAS in the back stashed behind a battered portfolio and a box full
of spiral-bound sketchbooks She pulls it out Shes obviously
disturbed

by it but she cant tear her eyes away

Shes still gaping at the painting when JULIE enters in a terrycloth
robe

ALICE
Who did this

JULIE
Stu That was right about the time we met

ALICE
When he first came in to the sleep lab

JULIE
Yeahbefore your time

The canvas depicts a group of SURGEONS with the faces of wolves
Theyre

standing over a HUMAN PATIENT replacing his internal organs with
MACHINE PARTS The style is at once cartoony and unsettling

ALICE
Jesus honeyhe always joked about you curing
him but I never realized what you cured him
from

JULIE
He hadnt gotten a good nights sleep in years
The nightmares would wake him up and hed start
right in painting
(chuckling)

That boy looked like pluperfect hell

ALICEs gaze goes from the nightmare paintings to the MONKEYBONE

strips
tacked up over the drafting table

ALICE
How do you get from here - to there

JULIE
Switch hands

ALICE
What

JULIE

Im serious It was bicameral disjunction -
right brain and left brain out of balance He
was a rightie so I made him switch the pencil
to his left hand Just to see whatd come out

A smile comes to JULIEs face She settles in on the floor beside

ALICE

and digs through the various portfolios until she comes up with a
quickie CARTOON on the back of a napkin - the prototype for

ALICE

Monkeybone

JULIE
Left-handed he was funny Hed been doing all
this scary intense workthen he found out he
could draw this stuff and make me laugh and he
liked that
(shrugging)
And then the nightmares juststopped

ALICE
Wow - two guys in the same brain - Which one
did you fall in love with

JULIE smiles at the cartoon She isnt telling

JULIE
Ive put a ton of work into that boy Alice I
am not going to let him get away from me

INT ICU - MORNING
JULIE in her white lab coat wanders through Intensive Care and finds
a
WOMAN hunched over STUs bed BAWLING HER EYES OUT

Kimmy

KIMMY looks up Shes crying so much she can barely recognize JULIE

KIMMY
Oh Juliemy poor Stumy poor baby

JULIE

KIMMY
An hour ago
(gathering herself)
tried to prepare myself but I didnt know he
would be like like this I cant even bear to
look at him How about you Youre okay

JULIE
m fine Kimmy Fine

KIMMY
had so much I always wanted to say to him At
least he had a chance to give you the ring

JULIE

The ring

KIMMY
Grandmamas ring The engagement ring He asked
me to send it to him -

JULIE turns to look at STU in the bed The certain knowledge that he
was

about to propose is like a knife in her heart KIMMY feels bad as
well

having let the cat out of the bag but before they can hash it out -

VOICE FROM BEHIND
Mrs Brewster Julie Im Dr Edelstein

Cheery DR EDELSTEIN enters He shakes hands with the women then
checks
STUs readouts making notations on his clipboard

DR EDELSTEIN
Vital signs have stabilized Thats good
KIMMY
Can you give us a realistic sense of my
brothers chances

DR EDELSTEIN
Hes held on this far We cant do much but wait
and see

KIMMY
But thesemachines are whats keeping him
alive is that right

This remark sends a shiver down JULIEs spine but she keeps silent

DR EDELSTEIN
At the moment yes

KIMMY
Can you give me a realistic ideaof how long
this is going to last

DR EDELSTEIN
Comas are unpredictable He could wake up today
tomorrow a month from now

KIMMY
Honey I have to clarify this The thing is Dr
Edelstein my brother has an absolute horror of
doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -

JULIE
Kimmy he doesnt know whats going on He
doesnt even know hes ina -

KIMMY
Please Julie This is not easy for me Our
father took a long time to die A long time It
just about killed us all And Stu and I made a
pact that when our time came - we wouldnt let
it drag out

JULIE
Its too soon even to - talk about that

KIMMY
Give me a date Doctor

DR EDELSTEIN
Three months
(pause)
Theres always some brain damage But at three
monthsthe chances of coming back shrink
dramatically with every day

KIMMY

I want him to have every chance Doctor We can
certainly give itthree months

No one says anything But both women look at STU and then at each
other and everyone knows exactly where everyone else stands JULIE
has

a sinking feeling that STU is working on a 3-month deadline

DISSOLVE TO
INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

A beauty pageant - shapely INGENUES in EVENING GOWNS being introduced
by
an EMCEE with enormous teeth

EMCEE
And now the last of our five finalistsMiss
MichiganGEORGE T WILLOUGHBY

GEORGE is a pudgy shmoe with a small pencil mustache whos wearing
glasses a necktie and NOTHING ELSE He steps forward holding a
briefcase in front of his crotch looking EXTREMELY MORTIFIED

EMCEE
And now George will give us his analysis of
Heisenbergs Uncertainty Principle as it
pertains to third-world economics

CAMERA PULLS BACK - and we realize were in
INT COMA BAR - NIGHT

where BULL the BARTENDER and a number of PATRONS are watching GEORGEs
nightmare on the TV mounted over the bar

Onscreen NUDE GEORGE is sweating bullets He has no idea what to say
and the audience is beginning to laugh at him In a desperate feeble
attempt to buy timehe begins to SING

GEORGE
Im gonna wash that man right outta my hair

In fact he goes into a little softshoe keeping the briefcase poised
over his crotch Unfortunately THE CASE POPS OPEN dumping frilly
LINGERIE all over the stage The weeping GEORGE must crawl around on
all
fours to retrieve it

By now the onlookers at the bar are CRACKING UP All except one - the
lonely disconsolate fellow on the last stool nursing a martini -
STU

BULL
Hey Stu why so glum Everybody loves a good
humiliation nightmare

STU
Three months Bull Three months tonight Three
months since the accident - and Im no closer to
going home than I was then

BULL
Aw buck up Have another tini

STU
Im sick of martinis Im sick of the waiting
and the carnival rides and watching peoples
nightmares And of course I need not add -

He GRIMACES at MONKEYBONE whos stretched out atop the mighty
Wurlitzer

at the other end of the room The MERMAID CHANTEUSE is singing a
Dietrich number The Laziest Gal in Town - or at least trying to
because MONKEYBONE is caterwauling behind her By the time she gets to
the grand finale hes practically BAYING AT THE MOON

Pissed off she SHAKES her FIST at MONKEYBONE and pulls the lid of her
clamshell SHUT This suits MONKEYBONE just fine as it leaves him
alone

in the spotlight to soak up what little applause there is

MONKEYBONE
Thank you thank you for that very modest

response I know youre all in comas but still
And nowits dedication time

He gestures to JUMBO the elephant organist who begins to vamp

MONKEYBONE
Weve got a special dedication tonight This
ones from my ever-lovin boss Mr Stu Mopey -
I mean Miley - and were sendin it up to
a very special lady in the land of the living
Yes I do mean Julie - the beautiful Miss Julie
- who if she has a brain in her head is
shacked up right now with some good-lookin doc
she met in the ER
(pointing at STU)
JUST KIDDING BUDDY Because if we know anything
about Miss Julie we know she is faithful
loyal and true Even if her boyfriend is an
eggplant Which is why were dedicatingthis
very special tuneto her Jumbo

JUMBOs tasteful vamping gives way to a RAUNCHY ROCK BEAT - and
MONKEYBONE begins STRUTTING across the top of the piano bumping and
grinding and shaking his booty to the tune of -

MONKEYBONE
MAH baby does the Hanky-Panky UNHH
MAH baby does the Hanky-Panky UNHH

MONKEYBONE sings the same poignant line over and over until STU comes
storming over from the bar and YANKS HIM off the Wurlitzer by the
scruff

of his scrawny NECK

A trouper to the end MONKEYBONE WAVES at the crowd even as STU drags
him off to an empty table in the farthest corner of the room

STU
You have humiliated me in public for the last

time

MONKEYBONE
I doubt that Besides I cant help myself Im
just a figment of your imagination

STU
Then you can learn to act normally I had to

MONKEYBONE
Aw come on You know you love me Youre a
masochistic pain freak You gotta love me

STU
I am not And I dont gotta

MONKEYBONE waves and winks at every female who passes by STU whacks
him
upside the head

MONKEYBONE
You are too Mooning over Julie when we could
both be gettin’ some o this fine local action
Its not like shes gonna know Out of town
under five minutes and in a coma dont count
STU
Sorry The women here arent my type Most of
them arent even my species

Cocktail waitress KITTY a seven-foot cat-faced feline sex bomb

arrives

in her skimpy black dress and shows STU a Cheshire-cat grin

MONKEYBONE

reclines Odalisque-style on the table

A softie at

MONKEYBONE
Hellooooocoocoo Kitty

KITTY
Hiya Stu Refill on that martini

MONKEYBONE

KITTY

MONKEYBONE

KITTY

STU

Ill never see her again

heart KITTY sits across from STU and takes his hand

STU
I shoulda proposed Kitty That way at least
shed know how I feel That way shedwait for
me

She leans forward sympathetically From this particular vantage
MONKEYBONE has an unobstructed view of KITTYs cleavage And so does
STU
- although hes not quite as obvious about staring

KITTY
She is waiting for you Stu I know she is Guys
like you dont come along that often Believe
me I know

MONKEYBONE slinks over behind STU - up onto his shoulder - and
whispers
into his ear

MONKEYBONE
My Fellow Americans I have a dream Let us
boldly go where no man has gone before

STU
(trying to ignore him)

Im sorry Kitty - what were you saying

KITTY
I mean it Stu Youre one in a million

KITTY is holding the cleavage pose for an unnaturally long time Her
furry tail begins to swing back and forth playfully in the air Its
hypnotic - like a windshield wiper

STU stares at it MONKEYBONE stares at it And MONKEYBONES TAIL
responds by straighteningstiffeningbending upward slightly

STU
Im not so special Im just - kind of -

STU is suddenly aware of something LONG RED and WET unrolling onto
his

shoulder Its a TONGUEdangling out of MONKEYBONES OPEN MOUTH STU
lets out a YOWL OF SHOCK

Blushing bright red he GRABS THE TONGUE and shoves it manually back
into the monkey mouth whence it came

MONKEYBONE
Come on pal It was a compliment Youda done
the same if you had the equipment

STU
THAT DOES IT BACK IN THE PACK

MONKEYBONE
FORGET IT NO WAY IM NOT GETTING -
STU LUNGES at MONKEYBONE - who JUMPS OVER HIM BOUNDS off the edge of
the table and grabs hold of a CHANDELIER

MONKEYBONE
Im reportin this to my union

STU
What union

MONKEYBONE
The sidekicks union Me Tonto and Robin the
Boy Wonder You top bananas better watch your
ass

STU grabs a CHAIR and swings it at the chandelier MONKEYBONE makes a
series of SUBMARINE NOISES -

MONKEYBONE
DIVE DIVE

- and DIVES - directly between KITTYs breasts into her skimpy black
dress STU circles around KITTY following the undulating monkey-
sized

BLOB thats tunnelling around under her dress Finally MONKEYBONE pops
out of the BACK of the dress and NUZZLES KITTYS EAR

MONKEYBONE
I left my phone number in your undies Try not
to lose it in traffic

STU
Sorry Kitty Ill be right back after I choke
my monkey

MONKEYBONE runs under the pool table STU is giving chase when -
suddenly - a DOOR blows open in the chill night wind

EVERYONE IN THE BAR freezes in place

For there in the doorway is a looming ominous figure - the most
dreaded figure in all of Dark Town -

- a GRIM REAPER nine feet tall and swinging a scythe come to take
some
hapless coma victim to the land of Death

EERIE WINDS WHISTLE and the shroud FLUTTERS in the night breeze as the
REAPER looks from face to face For a moment he focuses on STU STU
backs away involuntarily with a mounting sense of dreadand
MONKEYBONE jumps into his arms clinging to him fearfully
But the REAPER moves on - past each COMA VICTIM in turn - finally
STOPPING in front of a TINY WIZENED PRUNELIKE OLD GENT in a

wheelchair who looks to be 110 years old at least

MONKEYBONE
Him Whew About time

REAPER
EARL BIEGLER IVE COME -

EARL

Cant hear you young fellow Speak up

REAPER

EARL BIEGLER IVE COME TO GIVE YOU - aw

Here

hell

GASPS OF ANTICIPATION all around the room as the REAPER hands EARL a

long white ENVELOPE EARL opens it slowly and removes

an oversized rectangular TICKETthe size of a Hershey bar made

of
SOLID GOLD with the letter E stamped upon it

VARIOUS CHARACTERS around the barroom react in hushed voices

BULL
An E-Ticket

PATRON
He got a reprieve

KITTY
Good for him Hes gonna wake up

EARL throws his crutches aside jumps out of his chair

and DANCES A

JIG waving the ticket over his head STU stares at him with naked

envy

STU
No No Not him

EARL

So long suckers See you in the funny papers

EARL does an end-zone dance toward the door One by one

get up from their seats to watch EARLs departure

EXT COMA BAR - STREETS - NIGHT

OTHER PATRONS

The COMA VICTIMS shuffle toward a BIG RIDE across the midway
Its a TEST YOUR STRENGTH machine - the kind where you slam down a
mallet and try to ring the bell Its surrounded by crocodile moats
and

storm fences and electrified barbed wire and a big sign reading
PRIVATE

- NO ADMITTANCE

EARL still jubilant inserts his E-ticket into a receptacle at the
entrance A DRAWBRIDGE LOWERS and CAROUSEL MUSIC cranks up and
CARNIVAL LIGHTS blink on and FIREWORKS rocket into the sky

All around them faces turn skyward CLOUDS are parting An EDDY of
swirling colors is forming DIRECTLY ABOVE the E-ticket ride - anda
PINPOINT HOLE opens up at its center

The TEST YOUR STRENGTH machine has been outfitted with a SEAT where
the bell-ringer should be Once EARL has settled in a GIANT

MECHANICAL
MAN lifts its enormous mallet

and SLAMS IT DOWN on the lever end of the machine sending EARL
ROCKETING UPWARD toward the hole in the sky DING The SEAT hits the
BELL but EARL keeps going - up - up - UP

Then with a distinct POP hes gone Over the rainbowhome

STU
Hes ninety Hes practically dead already How
come he goes back and I stay here

MONKEYBONE
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket

STU
(turning abruptly)
HEY HEY YOU

STU marches across the street to the GRIM REAPER - whos climbing onto
his WINGED BICYCLE and seems shocked that anyone would want to chat
with

him MONKEYBONE scurries alongside terrified

STU
He got an E-ticket Wheres mine When do I get

to wake up

MONKEYBONE
Stu Stu Lets not disturb the nice Reaper

sTU
Ive been stuck down here for months Somebody
had better start paying attention or Im gonna
- Im gonna kick ass

MONKEYBONE
Lets not kick the nice Reapers ass

MONKEYBONE practically swoons But the REAPER just stares at STU

REAPER
SORRY BUD OFF-DUTY

The REAPER climbs onto his winged bike and PEDALS OFF down the midway

STU lets out a HOWL OF FRUSTRATION

MONKEYBONE
Stu Stu Lets calm down talk things over How
about some comedy relief Okay Brontosaurus
walks into a gay bar

STU BOOTS MONKEYBONE aside Theyre at a GAME STALL manned by Elsie

the

Cow - the one where you throw baseballs at milk bottles STU picks
a

baseball and HURLS IT at the departing REAPER

up

The ball hits the REAPER smack on the head knocking him off his bike

STU MONKEYBONE
(in unison - impressed)
Damn

MONKEYBONE cowers in fear as the REAPER gets up shaking a fist at
them
But STU isnt intimidated He grabs another ball and winds up

MONKEYBONE
Stu Stu I think weve got this backwards Your
behavioris disturbing me

The REAPER scared shitless jumps back on his bike and PEDALS OFF
the ball whizzes past STU starts chasing after him

The REAPER turns down a side street and pedals up an incline - one
the fingers of the hand that holds Dark Town When the bike hits
end of the finger it TAKES OFF into the void and KEEPS ON GOING

STU
Thats right Run And dont come back unless

youve got my e-ticket

The REAPER vanishes STU sits dejectedly on the edge of the curb

as

of
the
STU
Who am I kidding Im never gonna get out of
here Ill never see her again

Just then a multi-armed MESSENGER BOY in royal livery toodles past on
a
CHILDS SCOOTER He stops

MESSENGER BOY
Miley Stu Miley

STU looks up Six arms reach into six pockets Finally the MESSENGER
finds an ENVELOPE and hands it over Inside is an ENGRAVED INVITATION

YOU Are Invited to a
PAJAMA PARTY
at HYPNOS HIDEAWAY
Penthouse Suite - 10 PM Sharp
If You Snooze You Lose

STUS EYES widen with excitement as the MESSENGER scoots off

STU
Hypnos The god of nightmares Do you know what
this means Monkeybone Hes finally going to
hear my case Im going home

DISSOLVE TO
INT STUS PRIVATE ROOM - MORNING

As shes done every morning for the last three months JULIE brushes
STUS TEETH Although she looks a bit more worn and haggard than when
we

saw her last she always affects a cheerful manner around STU - on the
off chance that he might be aware of her presence

She packs the toothbrush away runs a hand along his stubbly cheek

JULIE
I think we can go another day without shaving
Long as you dont look like youre growing one
of those stupid little goatees

She opens up the entertainment section of the daily newspaper

JULIE
Hey theres an article about the Monkeybone
show Theyve run that one episode about eight
times now Herb says it gets higher ratings
every timetheyre hoping youll give em some
new material soon
(long bored pause)
Wanna hear another joke

She refolds the paper and reaches into a bedside drawer for a
paperback
entitled The Book of Raunch She pages through it for a moment

JULIE
Okaylet me seehere we go A plane full of
explorers crashlands in New Guinea they are
captured by a cannibal tribe and taken to the
chiefs hut wherewait a minute I know this
one
(reading ahead)

You stinker You swiped this joke for a
Monkeybone strip

She whacks him on the arm with the book No response at all

JULIE
Okay Lets try again Why did the pervert cross
the road

The sound of SOBBING interrupts her joke She looks up and sees KIMMY
standing in the doorway red-eyed and crying

JULIE
Kimmy Whats the matter

KIMMY
This is hard for me Julievery hardbut
its been three months now and
(long pause)
I gave the order

JULIE just stares at her for a beat or two refusing to understand
Then
it sinks in Her hand goes to her mouth in horror and grief
FADE THROUGH TO
EXT HYPNOSPIRE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

CAMERA TRACKS up the seemingly endless length of the HYPNOSPIRE - up
up THROUGH a heavy layer of clouds to the ROTATING PENTHOUSE DOME of
the building

which is festooned with oodles of 18-INCH DSS SATELLITE DISHES

INT HYPS HIDEAWAY - NIGHT
ELEVATOR DOORS open and we glide into the swank swingin space-age
bachelor pad of HYPNOS God of Sleep A giant flying CUPID welcomes
us

tiny bumblebee wings somehow keeping his vast bulk aloft

HYPS HIDEAWAY occupies the entire penthouse floor and theres always
a

party in full effect A rotating disco ball flashes colored light on
walls floors and ceilings covered with shockadelic OP-ART PATTERNS

MONKEYBONE
Now thisis livin

Of course a party needs party animals - and the DARKTOWNERS on the
scene are in fine fettle working up a sweat on the dance floor DJ
SLEEPY Z2ZZS has three turntables spinning at once

As STU wanders through he gets a big surprise Reproductions of his
old

NIGHTMARE PAINTINGS are hanging on the walls Theyve been turned into
ONE-SHEETS for the coming attractions at the Morpheum

MONKEYBONE
Ycall that art Why my three-year-old can
paint better than that

STU
Like youd know You started out on the back of
a napkin you littledoodle

Scowling at each other the boys turn their backs and part ways We
follow MONKEYBONE to the wet bar where he almost immediately bumps
into

a statuesque GORGON with a full head of writhing SNAKES

MONKEYBONE
Hey Like the do So tell me are you a uhh
natural snakehead

GORGON
Only fifty dollars to find out

MONKEYBONE
Fifty dollars Bite me

GORGON
You got it big boy

He grins and shrugs what the hell As they head for a back room the
BARTENDER hands him a SNAKEBITE KIT
A look of apprehension crosses MONKEYBONEs face But before he can
change his mind the GORGONS HAND yanks him out of frame

STU meanwhile is crossing the dance floor moving among glittering
animal-people who DANCE in their bizarre uninhibited way A FIVE-
LEGGED

WOMAN - the bottom half of her body a big human HAND - SMILES at STU
as

he passes He tries to talk to her but shes dancing and with five
constantly moving legs its difficult to get in close

STU
Say have you seen Mr Hypnos

HAND WOMAN
Hyp He was here a while ago Arent you Stu
Miley The nightmare guy

STU grins meekly nods yes She pulls him over to dance

HAND WOMAN
I heard you were going to be here tonight This
is so cool

JUMBO the ELEPHANT GOD is dancing in ungainly fashion nearby His
trunk

swings out and hits one of the HAND WOMANS arms - which SNAPS OFF
like

marble statuary Before she can let out a squeal he does it again
Now

shes armless - a regular Venus de Milo

HAND WOMAN
You fat slob Watch what youre doing

JUMBO
Why dont you slap me Go on slap me

HAND WOMAN
Come on Stu Lets go where the real fun is

She leads him over to the sunken living room Among the other guests
we

see a CYCLOPS a YETI a BBO PIG A number of sofas and lounge chairs
are arranged around a big crystal ORB in the center of the room

The ORB is where nightmares happen Although the perspective shifts
and

the locales change abruptly as in a movie all the nightmares have a
3-D quality - as if theyre taking place right here in the room with
us
STU
Wow Live feed huh

HAND WOMAN
You bet Hyp gets all the best stuff before it
goes out to the theatres

STU grins in anticipation He finds an empty chair and starts to sit
down - but theres a SLUG with a MANS HEAD already in it

SLUG WITH A MANS HEAD
HEY

STU
Sorry

STU picks another seat The HAND WOMAN sidles up alongside him

HAND WOMAN
Shh Theres a new one just starting

EXT FIELD OF FLOWERS (NIGHTMARE ORB)

In long shot we see a handsome young couple dressed in paisley prints
Emerging from a sylvan glade they kiss in golden sunlight Then the
MAN

breaks free - sprints through knee-high sunflowers to the middle of
the

field where a picnic blanket is waiting

CLOSEUP - STU
HIS FACE GOES PALE as he recognizes the man in the paisley shirt

STU
That - thats me

CYCLOPS
Nice shirt dude

EXT FIELD OF FLOWERS (NIGHTMARE ORB) - DAY

Paisley-shirted STU pours champagne for two Toasts his beloved - who
is of course JULIE the dreamer of the dream

He pulls out a little velvet RING BOX and offers it to her But when
she
tries to take it he pulls it away teasing her and STEALS A KISS

Suddenly the two of them are locked in a tight embrace rolling
together
through the flowers LAUGHING full of joy
INT HYPS HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT
The DARKTOWNERS are rubbing their hands together in anticipation of

horrors to come STU looks from one misshapen face to the next his
heart pounding with dread

STU
What is this Whos dreaming this
(beat)
Julie
YETI

Hey keep it down
EXT FIELD OF FLOWERS (NIGHTMARE ORB) - DAY

JULIE rolls onto her back on the grass FACE AGLOW Only to realize
that STU IS NO LONGER THERE BESIDE HER

She looks around Gets to her feet Turns And the BACKGROUND behind
her
MORPHS suddenly into

INT HOSPITAL ROOM (NIGHTMARE ORB)

The room is decorated for a FAREWELL PARTY complete with streamers
and

confetti KIMMY DR EDELSTEIN various MEDICAL PERSONNEL and FRIENDS
are wearing party hats lifting champagne glasses in a toast to the
guest of honorthe comatose Stu

INT HYPS HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT

The DARKTOWNERS clustered around the orb can barely conceal their
animal

excitement Its obvious that the nightmares theyre watching are more
than mere entertainment - they get some kind of addictive visceral
charge from the spectacle of human terror

sTU
JULIE

He tries to push his way forward to the orb An angry CYCLOPS elbows
him
aside A YETI grabs his coat and pushes him out of the way

HAND WOMAN
Stu What are you doing Chill out

INT HOSPITAL ROOM (NIGHTMARE ORB)
COMATOSE STU stands in the center of the room UPRIGHT and IMMOBILE in
a

party hat A weird UMBILICAL CORD extends from his navel to a huge
groaning BELLOWS DEVICE - like an artificial lung its all that keeps
him breathing

EDELSTEIN hands a pair of OVERSIZED CEREMONIAL SCISSORS to KIMMY and
she CUTS THE CORD as if opening a new mall Applause all around
JULIE

races toward STU in slo-mo SHRIEKING -

- as he DEFLATES into a LIMP PUDDLE OF FLESH before her eyes

JULIE
No No STU

INT HYPS HIDEAWAY - ON STU

JULIEs distress is killing him Yet all around him DARKTOWNERS are
cackling their heads off growling howling punching their fists in
the

air like rowdy drunks at a football game He LOSES IT ALTOGETHER

STU
JULIE IM HERE DOC DONT LET THEM PULL THE
PLUG IM HERE

He wont be stopped this time He makes for the orb - climbing over
sofas pushing guests aside knocking over their drinks -

CYCLOPS
HEY Watch it you stinkin gringo -

STU
JULIE IM HERE I LOVE YOU

Somehow JULIE has heard him Down in the nightmare orb her dream
self

is looking UP trying to locate the source of STUs disembodied voice
He struggles to reach the orb but the CYCLOPS is holding him back

JULIE
Stu STU

STU breaks free and FLINGS HIMSELF on the ORB - which SHORTS OUT ina
haze of smoke and sparks abruptly ending the nightmare JULIEs image
vanishes - and STU gropes at the air DESPAIRING

INT STUS PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT

The real JULIE awakens suddenly and lets out a scream of her own
JULIE
STU

Only now does she realize where she is Shes fallen asleep in the
visitors chair next to STUs bed The clock on the wall reads 115
AM

STUS READOUTS are spiking like crazy
INT HYPS HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

STU is being dragged across the dance floor by the YETI and JUMBO THE
ELEPHANT GOD HAND WOMAN brings up the rear

JUMBO
Who invited this schmuck anyway

HAND WOMAN
Oh its my fault I thought he was cooler than
that

STU
Listen Please Its my girlfriend Ive gotta
get a message to her

But just then a hush falls over the room and someone screams

WOMANS VOICE
HYP

A WALL PANEL does a 180-degree turn and a CIRCULAR BED rotates into
the

room Languishing atop it garbed in a silk robe which exactly matches
the black and white checkerboard pattern of the bedspread

is a CHUBBY GRINNING SLEEPY-EYED SATYR with horns and hooves
TWO

WASP WOMEN are with him on the bed brushing his furry goat legs and
feeding him grapes

As STU fights his way over he sees an odd LUMP wriggling under the
bedcovers Out pops MONKEYBONE clutching a bottle of champagne

MONKEYBONE
I knew I left it in there somewhere

He shakes the bottle pops the cork and SPRAYS SPURTING BUBBLY at
HYPNOS the GIRLS and everyone else within firing range

HYPNOS
Haw I like a monkey with vision
MONKEYBONE
You said it partner

Hilarity all around STU snatches MONKEYBONE off the bed -

STU
Howd you get in there

MONKEYBONE
Stu Its a party

STU
Mr Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -

HYPNOS
Wait a minute Stu Miley right Boys and girls

This is an honor We see a lot of nightmares

STU

having it She dreamed they were pulling the
plug on me She was watching me die

HYPNOS
Uh huh And

STU
Well I have to get a message to her I have to
let her know Im okay Until I can get out of
here

A vaguely embarrassed look crosses HYPNOSs face All the nearby
DARKTOWNERS stare at their shoes clear their throats

STU
which is actually what I wanted to talk to
you about See Ive been here three months —-

With a brusque gesture HYPNOS sends the party girls packing He
slings
one arm around STUs shoulder and pulls him aside

HYPNOS

sTU

HYPNOS

STU

One by one the celebrants turn their backs and slink discreetly away

STU

dont I get to Is there some

HYPNOS

Ysee Stu as I understand it you made this
pact with your sisterno life support

MONKEYBONEs jaw drops He slaps himself across the forehead

MONKEYBONE
Pact Pact NO LIFE SUPPORT

STU
Well - yeah - but that doesntapply It was
different then I was depressed My life is

MONKEYBONE marches back and forth across the bed wearing a dimwits
expression as he MOCKS STU in a singsongy voice

MONKEYBONE

dont need em I dont need no Life support
Im an idiot Pull the pl--

STU grabs the monkey and clamps a hand over his mouth

STU
Besides Julie wouldntshed never

HYPNOS
Actually Stu Julie doesnt get to decide
Thats why she was having the nightmare
(an embarrassed shrug)
Theyre pulling the plug at nine AM

STU
Nine AM But thats - twelve hours

In checking his watch STU removes his hand from MONKEYBONEs mouth
The
singsong resumes

MONKEYBONE
Im so dumb I deserve to die -

STU
Mr Hypnos you run this place Im begging you
Theres gotta be something I can do

HYPNOS
Stu I like you personally I admire your work
but Im just the God of Sleep This is Deaths
bailiwick

STU

HYPNOS

be a cold cold day in Las Vegas Nevada before

HYP shuts up Looks around the room as if hes afraid of being
overheard Then he gestures to the boys to join him on the bed

They climb aboard eagerly HYPNOS hits his remote
INT HYPNOSS BEDROOM - ON BED
and they rotate AWAY from the party Privacy at last

HYPNOS
Now Death is not what you would call a people
person like me Death is a putz - and I should

HYPNOS
Oh yeah Mr By-the-book Stick-Up-the-Ass My-
Way-or-the-Highway Death Believe me - over the

So I need a job He sticks me in this broke-down
amusement park with a buncha animals to run it

MONKEYBONE

HYPNOS

INT HYPS HIDEAWAY - A MOMENT LATER

HYP gives the boys a wink and a thumbs-up then wanders off to shmooze

He turns and stalks off MONKEYBONE stands there blinking

MONKEYBONE

Stunned MONKEYBONE scurries along behind him PLEADING

MONKEYBONE
You gotta talk me into it Youll screw up on

For moral support Wisecracks - snappy banter -
(wrapping himself around STUs leg)
Its the land of Death Stu the Land of Death
Dont go in there without your comedy relief

sTU
All right You can come

MONKEYBONE
OH THANK YOU THANK YOU TH--
(suddenly realizing)
Something went very very wrong here

STU
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there

As if in reply a PALE SPECTRAL PRESENCE comes drifting across the
dance floor - an eight-foot-tall GRIM REAPER
The boys duck behind a POTTED PLANT to watch as he zeroes in on the
WET

BAR - where a beautiful coma victim LULU is drunkenly making out
with

another sloshed corpse-to-be FRED

REAPER
LULU LA RUE I HAVE COME FOR YOU

LULU doesnt notice She continues grappling with FRED Muttering the
REAPER dives in and tries to disentangle them

REAPER
LULU LA RUE I HAVE COME FOR -

LULU
Shay youre kinda cute

She ditches FRED and throws her arms around the REAPER Repulsed he
pushes her away props her against the nearest wall -

- and TOUCHES HER with one bony finger above the heart Its like
throwing a switch Her body stiffens Her EYES cross Her TONGUE
droops

out of her mouth She makes a noise like a DIAL TONE

The true horror of death is that it makes you look like a total idiot
The REAPER pulls a collapsible HAND TRUCK from beneath his shroud and
starts maneuvering LULU onto it

FRED
Say there How bout one for the road

The REAPER ignores him FRED holds up a cocktail glass

FRED
Hold this for me pally

The REAPER heaves a sigh and takes the cocktail glass FRED grabs a
pitcher filled with some luminescent tropical concoction

and POURS IT down the REAPERs front
FRED
Ooopsy daisy
ON STU AND MONKEYBONE - BEHIND THE PLANT
WINCING at the REAPER in his sopping wet pink-stained shroud

MONKEYBONE
Is that what they call death with dignity

The REAPER wrings out his shroud and grabs the hand truck As he
wheels
LULU past the boys MONKEYBONE pops up with a helpful hint

MONKEYBONE
Two words for you my friend club soda

STU claps a hand over MBs mouth as the REAPER turns down a hall
EXT DARK TOWN GATES - NIGHT

The still-muttering REAPER wheels LULU toward the entrance to Dark
Town
The boys are skulking along behind him at a discreet distance

STU
Hes taking her to the land of Death right So
all weve gotta do ishitch a ride
(beat)
Stop shaking Ill protect you

MONKEYBONE
Oh sure Mr Action Hero Why couldnt I be
Arnold Schwarzeneggers figment

The REAPER approaches the GATES He presses a remote-control BEEPER
and

the meshing teeth of the gates slide back far enough to let him pass
through

STU realizes theyve only got an instant to make their move He DIVES
through the gates at top speed As soon as hes on the other side he
hears a nasty CLANG behind him

MONKEYBONE is caught - his body contorted like a pretzel woven in and
out among the meshing teeth STU gives him a good hard YANK and he
slips out like a strand of fettuccine

They hear RUMBLING on the tracks outside A CAR is arriving

EXT DARK TOWN GATES - OTHER SIDE - NIGHT

The REAPER loads LULU into the little roller-coaster and climbs
aboard

The car begins to move STU and MONKEYBONE get there just in time to
jump onto the LUGGAGE RACK in the back

ON ROLLER-COASTER - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

They peep over the back of the car at the REAPER and wonder what to do
next MONKEYBONE spies a TOOL KIT mounted under the rack - opens it
and
pulls out a big nasty MONKEYWRENCH

The boys nod in agreement MONKEYBONE clambers over the back of the
car
and hoists the wrench STU covers his eyes WHANG

STU looks up - sees a confused MONKEYBONE alone in the car with LULU
Now he clambers into the car as well

STU
Whered he go

MONKEYBONE
I dont know

Theres no trace of the REAPER - except for a rumpled shroud a
wristwatch and a St Christophers medal on the floor of the car The
boys exchange a puzzled shrug MONKEYBONE tries on the watch

A PANORAMIC VIEW of an impossibly grand Gilded-Age TRAIN STATION A
central turntable is the hub for dozens of TUNNELS which converge
like

the spokes of a wheel disgorging long trains full of DEAD PASSENGERS
from all over the world

Far above in the dizzying reaches of the vaulted DOME that crowns the
station REAPERS on FLYING BICYCLES spiral about like mosquitos
bringing dead souls to their final reward

This is Thanatopolis - land of Death - truly the end of the line

A WET SQUEEGEE scrapes across the frame - wielded by a GRIM REAPER in
a

jumpsuit bearing the logo of LAND OF DEATH WINDOW WASHERS INC The
noise is irritating so a REAPER on the inside snaps the venetian
blinds

shut cutting off our view

CAMERA PULLS BACK and we realize weve been seeing all this through
the
wall-to-wall windows of

INT DEATHS OFFICE - NIGHT

It looks like the observation bridge in the nose of the Nautilus the
decor is ornate and the office equipment - vacuum tubes pipe
intercoms etc - is on loan from the Jules Verne Museum of Defunct

REAPERS are bustling about everywhere One of them pushing a HAND
TRUCK
laden with oversized crates bearing the label DEAD SOULS

REAPER
Batch of souls - just back from Processing

DEATHS ASSISTANT
Put them over there with the others

He unloads the crates in a corner of the room where SCORES of crated
souls are already piled up

DEATHS ASSISTANT
Your Grimness We have a new shipment -

Yeah yeah yeah Ill get to it

We cant see DEATH himself - just the back of a tall swivel chair
With
much creaking it rotates around - bringing us face-to-face with

Hes not at all what youd expect Hes a chubby-cheeked bespectacled
ACCOUNTANT TYPEa harried bureaucrat just trying to do his job
Theres something sweet almost avuncular about him

Theres an open crate of DEAD SOULS on his desk Dead souls take the
form of PERFORATED PAPER DOLLStwo-dimensional underwear-clad
usually wearing expressions of shock DEATH pulls a sheet from the
box

detaches the dead soul and outfits it with a cut-out TOGA

Now he places it in a big diorama - with OODLES of toga-clad souls
staring up at a scale model of an active volcano He throws a switch
and

BEAMS as the volcano spits BLOBS OF KETCHUP into the air

DEATH

Moment in Death

DEATHS ASSISTANT
If I may point outit is 1205

DEATH grumbling digs into the box and pulls out another soul His
eyes
light up He clutches the sheet with trembling hands

DEATH
I cant believe - oh man I - SINATRA Do you
know how long Ive been waiting for this

Sure enough the doll on the sheet is Ol1 Blue Eyes DEATH digs ina

snaps his fingers and WHISTLES

His pet HELLHOUND - a tiny plump weiner dog with a HORNED DEATHS

Its a big occasion A formal occasion And as

VAULT DOOR with a hydraulic wheel - the kind you see at banks The

returning a moment later with a priceless gold E-TICKET

repeatedly across STUS FACE

The REAPER in front of the boys stares at the E-ticket crestfallen

DEATH

live another forty years

Sorry Nobody said this job would be easy

The ASSISTANT hands the REAPER a YELLOW MAILMANS POUCH containing the
E-ticket But before he can depart the STAINED REAPER - aka STU and
MONKEYBONE - jumps to the front of the line

MONKEYBONE

Say Death just out of curiosity could we
maybe swap jobs with that other guy See weve
been meaning to drop in on Dark Town - I mean
Ive been meaning to

DEATH is stunned by this unprecedented breach of protocol The other
REAPERS in the line are ABUZZ

An ENRAGED STU is yanking on MONKEYBONES TAIL signalling him to shut
up MONKEYBONE in pain squeals repeatedly Finally he reaches down
and

PUNCHES STU IN THE NOSE

The blow sends STU staggering DEATH and the other REAPERS look on in
astonishment as the STAINED REAPER does a bizarre DANCE across the
floor top half and bottom half moving independently Miraculously he
manages to right himself and regain his balance

DEATH
Now what were you saying

STUMONKEYBONE
(in unison)

Nothing

Id like to have a word with you in private

He stands and gestures toward a side room The boys follow The little
HELLHOUND scampers out from behind the desk

and GRABS THE HEM OF THEIR SHROUD in its teeth The boys keep on
walking but the shroud stays behind Somehow they go three or four
steps before they realize theyve been exposed

With a SCREECH MONKEYBONE LEAPS into the air BOUNDS OVER the heads
and

shoulders of the advancing REAPERS and SNATCHES the yellow E-ticket
pouch from the guy Death gave it to

He bounds over a table and into STUs arms with the precious pouch in
hand DEATH lets out a great rattling BELLOW OF RAGE

His features begin to JITTER VIOLENTLY HIS HEAD EXPLODES

Nothing to lose at this point With a CRASH the boys DIVE THROUGH THE

He pulls out a spare and screws it onto DEATHs neck

The boys land hard at the edge of the trainyard Behind them REAPERS
are shepherding a line of newly arrived DEAD PEOPLE past a sign which
reads PROCESSING - THIS WAY

By the time they can dust themselves off an ALARM starts blaring
REAPERS drop what theyre doing point at the boys Panic time

Nearby a FLYING BICYCLE is propped up against a SIGN Side-by-side

race toward the bike each of them clutching the strap of the pouch
YANKING each other back and forth in a tug-of-war

DEATH has activated the TRAIN TURNAROUND - the rotating platform at
the

end of the line which allows an engine to reverse direction Before
they

know it theyre doing a full 180

The boys continue to bounce down the tracks - but the tunnel entrances
seem to be SPINNING before their eyes Before they know it theyre
pedaling directly TOWARD the mob of ANGRY REAPERS

WINCES IN PAIN as the bike BOUNCES over a series of rails

nose at the REAPERS STU glances back as well laughing unable to
believe his own good luck

Since theyre both looking the wrong way neither of them sees the
sheer monolithic WALL rising up DIRECTLY IN THEIR PATH

Its no ordinary wall Its STUS PAINTING - the one ALICE found in
the

closet the wolf-surgeon canvas from his scary period -

- and as the bicycle SLAMS INTO IT it begins to TOPPLE OVER - PINNING

table

with the world of the painting coming to 3-D life around him The
WOLF-

FACED SURGEONS are closing in on him baring their fangs brandishing
their scalpels and their metallic REPLACEMENT PARTS

Suddenly the fabric of this weird reality TEARS - just like a rip ina

to ribbons

basis of bad dreams And she just whipped up a
big old batch of nightmare juice

STUs face goes white as he realizes the point of the master plan

HYPNOS
Oh were predicting a record box-office Its

HYPNOS marches off chuckling STUs head sinks into his hands

EXT STU AND JULIES HOUSE - DAY

STUs back from the hospital JULIE is removing his bags from the
trunk
of KIMMYs car while STU and KIMMY chat in the front seat

KIMMY
I just couldnt stand the thought of you
suffering I love you so I would never have
forgive me Stu Please forgive me

STU-BONE
Kimmy Chill Weve still got a pact If
anything ever happens to you Ill be right
there to return the favor
(baring his teeth)
So drive carefully From now on

He climbs out KIMMY is so rattled that she smacks bumpers with the
car

parked in front of her She PEELS OUT with the hand brake still on
INT STU and JULIES HOUSE - DAY

STU-BONE and JULIE enter with luggage He stands there for a moment
scoping out the unfamiliar surroundings She sets the bags down taps
him on the shoulder

JULIE

Welcome home

STU-BONE grins insipidly She kisses him pulls him into a tight

embrace

- and then overwhelmed by emotion begins to SOB

JULIE

Oh baby I cant believe youre back

STU-BONE

Home sweet home huh Actually I was expecting
something a little swankier How much loot does
old Stu rake in anyway

She gives him

an extremely puzzled look

STU-BONE

Meaning me of course Im referring to myself
You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty
lucrative franchise

JULIE

Baby Why dont you justrest on the sofa for

She goes into
bowl of FRESH

a banana with

the

minute Ill be right back

the kitchen as STU-BONE plops onto the sofa He spies a
FRUIT on the coffee table and immediately tries to pick

his FOOT
Hes got shoes on Frowning he unties his shoe peels

bare foot is in the fruit bowl when JULIE returns from

kitchen with a TRAY holding a chocolate cake and the bottle of

CHAMPAGNE

Stu bought three months ago The cake bears the message WELCOME HOME

I LOVE YOU in pink icing

She sits beside him with the goodies He removes his foot from the

bowl

crosses his legs WIGGLES HIS TOES at her She smiles uncertainly

Then
she opens the

bottle of champagne and pours two flutes full

JULIE

Heres to a bottlewe should have opened
three months ago
She finishes pouring hands a flute to STU-BONE His face is smeared
with CAKE and ICING Hes scooped out a big fistful and crammed it
right

into his pie hole He GRINS at her

STU-BONE
Bitchin good cake

JULIE
Stu are youfeeling okay

STU-BONE
Sure Why

JULIE
Youre acting kind ofodd

STU-BONE
(grabbing another fistful)

In what way

Then we hear TINY NAILS skittering across the hardwood floors at high
speed And BUSTER THE DOG races into the living room

JULIE
Buster Look whos here

STU-BONE tenses instinctively The dog is yipping wagging his tail
insanely at the sight of his long-lost master - until he gets just a
little bit closer and senses that something is very very wrong

BUSTER sizes STU-BONE up and GROWLS STU-BONE bares his teeth and
HISSES The dog LUNGES - and STU-BONE jumps up on the sofa

STU-BONE
Oh shit the cake

He bends down snatches up the cake and CRADLES IT under one arm as
he
KICKS AT BUSTER from the sofa

STU-BONE
Mine Get back MINE

The frazzled JULIE pours herself another jolt of champagne - a stiff
one

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

SOUNDS of JULIE taking a shower in the adjacent bathroom os
STU-BONE is sprawled in bed pillows propped up behind him flipping
channels on the bedroom TV with his trusty remote The Discovery
Channel

happens to be showing a Jane Goodall special

NARRATOR (on TV)
The mating rituals of the African silverback are
as rigidly formalized as those of any animal we
know - with the possible exception of man

Onscreen a FEMALE GORILLA is presenting her furry haunches to an ALPHA
MALE

STU-BONE watches this erotic spectacle with a connoisseurs eye He
glances over at the open bathroom door and catches a teasing glimpse
of

JULIES SHADOW as she steps out of the shower and pulls on a robe He
SCRATCHES and SNIFFS just to put himself in the mood

On TV MONKEY FOREPLAY which consists of a pounce from behind

NARRATOR (on TV)
In the wild a dominant chimpanzee male is
likely to engage in sex numerous times
throughout the day with a shockingly wide
variety of -

STU-BONE mutes the nature special and sneaks up behind JULIE just as
she
emerges from the bathroom in her robe and towel-turban

JULIE
What are you watching

STU-BONE
Ohhh nothing

She tries to pass but he grabs the belt of her robe and spins her
around He delicately unwraps the turban then opens her robe and
pulls

it closed around the two of them They kiss

JULIE
You sure this ismedically advisable

STU-BONE
Got a doctor on duty

JULIE
Well As long as its okay with Monkeybone -
STU-BONE almost lets out a gasp of shock What does she mean

JULIE
(glancing downward)

- which it seems to be

STU-BONE does a take The good news is she doesnt suspect The bad
news is hes apparently named after his creators penis

INT HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

All at once the air is full of Barry Whites lush baritone on the
bedroom CD player Through the bedroom doorway we see STU-BONE and
JULIE

waltzing romantically belly to belly still wrapped up in the single
robe

The only jarring note is BUSTERS FRANTIC BARKING The poor dog is
stuck

behind an accordion gate in the hall going crazy trying to warn his
mistress about the imposter in STUs body The dog is almost drowning
out Barry White -

- so STU-BONE stops kissing JULIE long enough to reach over with one
foot and KICK THE DOOR SHUT

INT BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER

JULIE watches from the bed as STU-BONE begins peeling off his PJs
going into a bizarrely formalized MONKEY MATING DANCE He circles back
and forth from one side of the bed to the other making faces
grunting

FEINTING at her occasionally

JULIE has some dim sense that this ritual is supposed to be erotic
but

in fact its making her damned nervous She finds herself scrunching
up

on the bed trying to keep out of STU-BONEs way

Now he LEAPS UP onto the foot of the bed REARS BACK And with an
animal
howl of triumph POUNCES AT JULIE

Terrified she rolls out of the way STU-BONES SKULL slams into the
headboard

JULIE
Oh God Baby Are you -
Dazed he sits up He tries to stand but his rubbery legs give way
and
he pitches over - CRACKING HIS SKULL AGAIN on the nightstand

EXT HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER
JULIE helps a punchdrunk staggering STU to the stairway

STU
How was it I dont recall

JULIE
It was great baby Lets get you to the ER

As they pass BUSTER lets out a little growl of satisfaction from
behind

his gate HOLD ON THE DOGs satisfied expression as STU-BONE loses his
balance and topples down the stairs 0OS

conference Were on TV so dont say shit
(covering his mouth)
Shit I said it Shit I said it again

REPORTER
Stu what is it about Monkeybone that makes him
so popular

STU-BONE

Well its partly that he punctures all the
phony pretensions of our modern societyand
its partly that hes a breathtakin
heartbreakin rump-shakin sex machine

(beat)
Ask these gentlemen here Theyre an important
cog in my media machine Theyll be doing six
new episodes of the Monkeybone show under my
personal supervision

He pauses for a photo op with MIKE CACHUELA and MIKE MITCHELL

STU-BONE
Its all synergy The show synergizes the strip
which synergizes the merchandising which
synergizes the religion which synergizes the
Barbara Walters special and then baby we are
all in the United Empire of Monkeybonia

INT KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

He wears a big monkey grin as he DREAMS the above

EXT STREET - DAY

A CARLOAD OF SUPERMODELS They kill their engine in the middle of a
busy
intersection and climb out to join the mob chasing STU-BONE

He cuts around a corner ducks into an alley and FLATTENS HIMSELF
behind a dumpster As the girls run past he pulls out a handkerchief
and MOPS SWEAT from his brow

Then with a what-the-hell twinkle he steps out and FLINGS HIS SWEATY
HANKIE into the midst of the GROUPIES A CATFIGHT ensues as they
scramble after this precious memento The chase resumes

Suddenly he realizes hes SLOWING DOWNrunning in SLO-MO Same deal
with the girls on his trail After a moment he FREEZES He cant move
anything except his EYES he looks right left up down

and suddenly he sees HYPNOS winking into view directly in front of
him HYPNOS is perfectly capable of moving He strolls right up to the
frozen STU-BONE and SLAPS HIM REPEATEDLY Moe Howard-style

HYPNOS
You two-bit simian stooge WHAT THE HELL IS

booty and chase broads We sent you up to make

STU-BONE tries to speak All that comes out is a slo-mo DRAWL

area and kneels beside a LOCKED REFRIGERATOR Then he shuffles through
the keys on the ring until he finds one labelled FRIDGE

On the top shelf is a corked beaker of purple fluid bearing the label
ONEIRIX with red DANGER stickers all over it STU-BONE takes it out
flashes a sinister grin and EMPTIES ITS CONTENTS into a similar

beaker
Then he refills the original from a hip flask and replaces it

Hes just about to leave when hes startled by a series of SIMIAN
GRUNTS
and SQUEAKS - which are TRANSLATED in SUBTITLE

FEMALE BABOON

He turns and spots a SEDUCTIVE FEMALE BABOON whos confmed to a CAGE
in

He pulls out a MATCHBOOK and scribbles a number on it

STU-BONE
Tell you what angel When you get out give me
a call

A LIGHT goes on suddenly in the outside hallway STU-BONE tries to
dive

for cover but the FEMALE BABOON grabs him by the belt and pulls him
against the cage

Startled he drops the ONEIRIX BEAKER - which rolls out into the hall

He cant quite pull himself through the door

He unbuckles the belt UNZIPS HIS PANTS Keeps clawing toward the

impression that we were doing something
charitable Brilliant

HERB

CRUSHED PURPLE VELVET He carefully removes the treasure from its
chest

Its right hand is hinged The dolls thumb is UP ITS REAR

STU-BONE stares at the doll - cautiously yanks its thumb out We go to

And we STAY in slo-mo as STU-BONE stares at the doll in wonderment and
awea man in looooove

Still in slo-mo the EXECS crack up gag hold their noses at the

She draws ONE SHARP CLAW lightly down his chest He gives her a now-
youre-talkin grin and hits a switch - causing the big circular bed
to

ROTATE off the dance floor and into the boudoir

As it turns we see KITTYS PAW closing discreetly around a KEY CHAIN
on
the nightstand

INT DUNGEON - RIGHT

STUs curled up on the dank floor when hes awakened by the sound of a
VISITOR in the corridor outside - KITTY She passes a sack containing
FOOD and BOTTLED WATER through the bars - and SHUSHES the astonished
STU

before he can speak

KITTY
Shh Youll need it when youre traveling

Glancing back at the GUARDS she pulls a KEY from her cleavage

KITTY

OKAY STU SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO

She turns down the corridor STU stands there for a beat GAPING at
the
key in his hand

Then he hears the sound of CARNAGE outside A FEROCIOUS BLOODY BATTLE
seems to be underway Realizing that KITTY must be in trouble he uses
the key to unlock the dungeon door

INT DUNGEON - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

He finds KITTY hunched in the corner on all fours surrounded by blood
and tufts of fur and an abandoned GUARDS HAT

RODENTS TAIL dangling out of her mouth

roused the other DUNGEON DWELLERS and when they realize the dungeon
door is open they come rushing out en masse

Then the PANEL opens They hear FOOD raining down behind them

EXT ZOO - DAY

LIVERIED WAITERS scurrying all about in preparation for the benefit

into a giant pifiata in the shape of STANLEY

WIPE TO
INT DEATHS OFFICE - NIGHT
The big creaky swivel chair swings around revealing DEATH

DEATH
Now if I may ask - what kind of idiot sneaks
into the Land of Death twice

The party hes addressing is STU - whos stretched out horizontally
strapped to a medieval TORTURE RACK with a whole posse of GRIM
REAPERS

standing guard around him

STU
Youre mad at me Great You have every right to
be But were both mad at Dark Town Were both
mad at Hypnos

DEATH
Oh sure Now youre gonna tell me it was all
his idea You were completely innocent -

STU
Im not going to tell you that I wanted that E-
ticket I wanted it so bad Id stare you right
in the face to get it - and Id do the same
again

DEATH
Why
STU
I have a girl up there And I never - I
shouldve - I just want to tell her I love her

DEATH
Im a simple man Im just doing my job I enjoy

my job Why does everyone want to make it
difficult for me Stealing tickets switching
bodiesit is so irresponsible

STU
Death Im trying to make things right Take my
soul Turn me into a paper doll But give me
just one lousy hour

DEATH
Well - youd need a body

DEATH gestures for the REAPERS to unshackle STU

DEATH
If it wasnt for that comic strip of yours I
wouldnt be doing this But a good chuckle is
darned hard to come by
(chortling)
That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake
out of the urinal - I thought I would die

STU
Coming from you thats quite a compliment

DEATH
De nada Now come herebend overbefore I
change my mind

STU
Bend over

DEATH rears back and KICKS HIM full-force SMACK IN THE ASS The
supernatural might of the blow sends STU ROCKETING UPWARD THROUGH THE
CEILING

INT HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM - DAY
A TEAM OF SURGEONS The lead SURGEON has his arm buried up to the
elbow

in the open torso of an ORGAN DONOR

SURGEON
Okaydetaching the left kidney
SCREAMS ALL AROUND as the ORGAN DONOR sits BOLT UPRIGHT The startled
SURGEON drops the kidney back into place

ORGAN DONOR
What the - who the hell am 1

SURGEON
Youre an organ donor

ORGAN DONOR
Am I dead

SURGEON
The chute didnt open We kind of assumed -

ORGAN DONOR
I need this body Just for a few minutes Ill
bring it back okay

The ORGAN DONOR grabs a lab coat from a nearby rack and races out
(And

since STU is temporarily occupying the DONORs body we will
henceforth

refer to him as OD STU)

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER

OD STU comes racing around a corridor His LAB COAT is already
covered

with gore and hes having trouble holding his GUTS in His PANCREAS
spills out onto the floor just as two DOCTORS stroll past

DOCTOR
(eyeing the pancreas)
Might have someone take a look at that

OD STU
Oh Yeah Thanks

The DOCTORS move on OD STU spots a JANITORS CART with a roll of
DUCT

TAPE on one shelf He WRAPS IT TIGHTLY around his midsection to keep
his

innards from falling out Then he runs for it

Now the TEAM OF SURGEONS rounds the corner in hot pursuit The lead

SURGEON spots 0OD STU at the end of the corridor and takes off after
him But he SLIPS on the PANCREAS and goes sprawling
The pancreas goes flying down the hall where it gets SQUASHED in
rapid

succession by a GURNEY and by a little old ladys MOTORIZED
WHEELCHAIR

When the SURGEONS retrieve it its a hunk of pulp

LEAD SURGEON
I think it can still be saved Put it on ice

All of a sudden they hear SHOUTS and LAUGHTER from the area of the
reptile house In the distance ZOO SECURITY GUARDS are chasing a
NAKED

MAN through the crowds of formally-dressed partygoers

CLARISSA

INT MUNI BUS - LATE AFTERNOON

PASSENGERS are holding their noses frantically pulling on the BELL
ROPE

to alert the driver that they want off As we move toward the back we
see 0D STU sitting alone with rows of empty seats on either side

He looks rough Hes bone-white his taped-up lab coat is crusted with
blood and he never did find any shoes Also its a hot night and
hes

starting to get a little ripe FLIES are buzzing all around him

EXT STREETS - THAT MOMENT

BUSTER runs down the sidewalk as fast as his stumpy little legs will
carry him in pursuit of the BUS

INT CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON

The team of SURGEONS has been tracking 0D STU across the city
Through

the windshield they see the BUS pulling up outside the zoo 0D STU
hops out and sprints across the parking lot

SURGEON

INT ZOO - ENTRANCE - LATE AFTERNOON
OD STU doesnt even stop at the ticket window He VAULTS over the
turnstile knocking benefit guests aside The SURGEONS arent far
behind They race up to the ticket window -

SURGEON

The TICKET-TAKER shrugs and points off in 0D STUs direction
INT BANQUET TENT - THAT MOMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

The last stages of dinner WAITERS are already clearing plates and
although JULIE has barely touched her food she sends her plate away

Onstage a BAND is playing tasteful zoo jazz When the number ends
STU-
BONE approaches the dais and leans into the mike

STU-BONE

As emcee I want to thank you all for joining us
at this swingin bashits a special night for
the birds and the lions and the monkeys but
its also a special night for -

(tapping his chest)
- this monkey And its special because of a

Julie McElroy Just kiddin Julie Stand up

JULIE stands reluctantly The CROWD APPLAUDS

STU-BONE
And to make this special night extra-special
Id like to do a special numberespecially for
you

A DISCO BALL lowers STU-BONE turns to welcome a group of BACKUP SOUL
SINGERS who are just joining the band on stage

The TENT begins to ROCK with a throbbing beat And STU-BONE launches
into a wild-eyed hip-shaking parody of Mick Jagger singing the
Rolling

Stones MONKEY MAN

As he sings STU-BONE gyrates over toward JULIE bumping and grinding
like the cartoon-monkey sex machine he is He waves his mike to the
crowd urging everyone to join in JULIE gasps in disbelief but the
crowd is eating it up - clapping and singing along with STU-BONE

He gestures for pretty women to join him out on the floor He opens
his
shirt at the neck exposing a hitherto unseen plenitude of chest hair
He pulls out a hanky to mop his brow and tosses it to the crowd He
wipes his armpits with a second hanky and tosses it to the crowd He
blows his nose into a third and tosses it to the crowd

Then he JUMPS UP ON THE TABLES and shakes his booty wildly strutting
in

and out among the dessert plates If the real Jagger could see him he
would creep home a sad and broken man

For the big finale he jumps off the table and SLIDES ACROSS THE FLOOR
to JULIES table - arriving ON HIS KNEES

STU-BONE
I am just a Monkey Man Im glad you are a
monkeywomantoo

(soft voice)
How about it Julie

He pulls out a RING BOX and hands it to the beet-red JULIE The crowd
lets out a collective GASP - followed by WILD APPLAUSE

She stares down at the ring - a big vulgar sparkler She cant speak

STU-BONE
Well hop a plane tonight An island ceremony
An Abba Dabba honeymoon

JULIE

STU-BONE
It is new Why wouldnt it be new

JULIE
But the heirloom ring Your grandmothers

STU-BONE

Heirloom Huh You want a used ring -

No reply Shes taking a long time to say yes The audience is
muttering

STU-BONE

Suddenly a GORE-STAINED FIGURE bursts into the tent

OD STU

ZOO
GUARDS arrive to haul him away

STU-BONE

GUEST

STU-BONE turns and does a simian COMEDY SHTICK for the crowd

STU-BONE

By the time hes done scratching his ribs JULIE has vanished
EXT ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON
She races out of the tent - grabs a passing ZOO GUARD

JULIE
Please Where did you take that man

The GUARD points to an ANIMAL CONTROL VAN JULIE sees OD STU peering
out through a small barred panel Their eyes meet

JULIE
Who are you Why did you say those things

OD STU
Oh Doc its all a mixup We were in the land
of death He stole my e-ticket Thats how he
got my body see All they had left for me was

JULIE digests this nods professionally and turns to walk away

OD STU
Dont walk away Doc Hes only here to give
people nightmares
(no response)
Doc Please Dont you remember the dream They
were pulling the plug - I called out to you -
and you heard me Remember

This stops JULIE cold Her spine is tingling She turns slowly a
single
tear rolling down her cheek And then

JULIE
BUSTER

The dog runs right past JULIE and bounds up to the animal control van
barking his head off Now JULIE is starting to believe She turns -

JULIE
Stuhow

OD STU
I had to come back Julie I had to give you
this

THROUGH THE BARS he hands her the little box containing Grandmas
antique ring

OD STU
I meant to give it to you before The night we
crashed I was so happy Julie Itry to
remember me like that okay Not like this

She slips the ring on her finger - looks up at OD STU with TEARS
WELLING in her eyes He makes an odd SNORKELING kind of noise

JULIE
Whats wrong

OD STU
Im crying too I just dont have any tears Im
all dried up

JULIE TURNS The two DETECTIVES we saw in the sleep lab have just
arrived at the gate and ALICE and CLARISSA are leading them over

ALICE

EXT ZOO GROUNDS - PINATA AREA - THAT MOMENT

The PARTYGOERS are lined up under the gigantic Stanley-shaped PINATA
which is hanging from a tree A TUBBY BANKER in a blindfold takes a
good

hard whack CRACKS are beginning to appear
STU-BONE
Okay folks its pifiata time - you know the
rules - five bucks a pop - and remember its
all for the benefit of our friends the animals
(eyes brightening)
Oooooh This ones on me

The next contestant is a GORGEOUS WOMAN He blindfolds her and
embraces
her from behind to help her with her grip on the bat

STU-BONE
Choke up baby Thats right Choke up

Suddenly he notices the COPS marching up with JULIE OD STU and co
in
tow He freezes terrified - BACKS AWAY from the BABE -

- and catches a BAT IN THE FACE Several people rush up to help him as
the COPS consult with the BENEFIT ORGANIZERS

ORGANIZER
I dont understand officer This is a benefit
Surely this can wait until -

COP
Sorry maamwe need to question Mr Miley on
a most urgent matter

JULIE
Stop this Now Those dolls have been tampered
with Theyre toxic

OD STU comes marching through the crowd He passes a LIFE-SIZED
DISPLAY of Stanley and MonkeyboneGRABS THE BACKPACK off the Stanley
figureand proceeds deliberately toward STU-BONE

OD STU
MONKEYBONEBACK IN THE PACK

The old command seems to retain its magical power because STU-BONE
clutches his gut as if stricken at the sound of it

OD STU
I mean it this time Back in the pack

STU-BONE bends over - jerks and twitches - becoming more SIMIAN by the
moment as OD STU approaches

STU-BONE
StuI can explainI was sick of being a
figment see Its awful being a figment Its
degrading And I never really wanted to give
people nightmares I just told em that so
theyd help me get a body

OD STU
Yeah - my body Back in the pack you simian
shitbird

The COPS are tres confused by all this -

COP
Maam can you give me some idea of whats going
on here

- but JULIE holds them back so the scene can play itself out Now STU-
BONE is doing a weird little monkey dance - PLAYING UP to the puzzled
crowd who laugh and snicker wondering what to make of all this

STU-BONE

Laugh damn youlaugh at the sidekickthe
happy little monkey He doesnt have any
feelings Hes just a figment of your
immagination

He turns suddenly - GRABS THE BAT from the puzzled BABE -

STU-BONE
GIMME THAT GODDAM BAT

He wails on the piffata like Ken Griffey Jr OD STU tries to stop
him

but its too late - the piffata BURSTS and hundreds of PURPLE-ASSED
MONKEYBONE DOLLS spill out onto the ground

An equal number of RABID PARTYGOERS surge forward to scoop them up
The
COPS swing into action trying to hold the crowd back

COP
HES GETTING AWAY

STU-BONE climbs a tree and JUMPS from a branch onto one of the TWIN
JUNGLE TOWERS at the pavilion - begins CLIMBING toward the giant
MONKEYBONE BALLOON moored up above

OD STU sees him - pulls away from JULIE -

OD STU
I LOVE YOU

JULIE
sTu
STU-BONE unties the mooring rope and wraps it around his midsection
Now
freed the balloon LIFTS INTO THE AIR CARRYING HIM ALOFT

OD STU climbs up the opposite tower as the balloon starts to drift
away He GRABS HOLD of the MOORING ROPE as it whips past

And the TEAM OF SURGEONS - who have been combing the grounds in search
of OD STU - catch sight of him just as he FLOATS OFF INTO THE AIR
ON

THE END OF THE ROPE

HEAD SURGEON
LOOK ITS HIM

EXT ZOO GROUNDS - ON BALLOON - MOVING

They rise to an altitude of ten or twelve feet But 0D STUs
additional weight pulls the balloon back DOWN - and both of them hit
the

ground They have to RUN at top speed just to keep pace with the
balloon

STU-BONE
Letgoyoudingleberry

As hes trying to KICK OD STU off the rope a GUST OF WIND catches
the
balloon and LIFTS IT HIGH INTO THE AIR

For about three seconds The boys tumble to earth off-balance ina
heap BOUNCING along the pavement The balloon pulls them over a
WROUGHT-IRON FENCE and drags them through the ALLIGATOR PIT Giant
jaws

snap as the boys glide overhead like bait on a hook

As the balloon LIFTS UP AGAIN OD STU hauls himself along the length
of the rope

He gets close enough to GRAB STU-BONEs LEG STU-BONE reaches down to
push him awaygrabs a fistful of DUCT TAPE

and RIP The tape TEARS - exposing the great big GASH in OD STUs
midsection He tries to pull himself together

EXT FOOD COURT - THAT MOMENT - LATE AFTERNOON
A SERVER ladles out a cup of PUNCH from a big silver PUNCHBOWL

Something PINK comes plummeting out of the sky - and the next thing he
knows the SERVER is DRENCHED
The SURGEONS come rushing up They all stick their hands in the
punchbowl at oncefishing out OD STUS KIDNEY

One of the TEAM finds an ice cooler full of soft drinks In it goes
EXT TIGER HABITAT - LATE AFTERNOON

BOTH BOYS SCREAM as the balloon drags them perilously close to the
RAZOR
WIRE atop a tall storm fence

They clear it by inches - but they dont have much time to celebrate
Theyre dangling over the Bengal Tiger exhibit and the great cats are
LEAPING INTO THE AIR trying to snag them

As 0D STU squirms out of reach his LIVER drops out
EXT GROUNDS - TIGER HABITAT - LATE AFTERNOON

It lands close enough to the FENCE that one of the SURGEONS thinks he
can reach it He reaches through the bars and sees a pack of BENGAL
TIGERS racing toward him He manages to grab ONE END of the liver -
but

a TIGER gets the other end -

- and its a TUG-OF-WAR until the tiger BITES the liver in half
sending

the terrified SURGEON sprawling on the pavement outside the bars The
HEAD SURGEON examines the remaining half-liver

HEAD SURGEON
Put it on ice I think it can still be saved

ANGLE ON BALLOON

STU-BONE socks OD STU hard across the face He lets go of his
incision

and his SMALL INTESTINE falls out Since its still connected at
both

ends the intestine forms a great big LOOP

EXT FOOD COURT - SERVING TABLE - LATE AFTERNOON

The SERVER has just brought out a new PUNCHBOWL full of nice clean
punch He sets it down on the table and is about to ladle out a cupful
when STU flies past overhead His intestinal LOOP slides across the
table knocking over glasses snagging the PUNCHBOWL at its base
and YANKING IT right off the table Bystanding GUESTS are DRENCHED
in
punch as the punch bowl FLIES END OVER END

and with the sound of a GONG being struck BEANS a member of the
SURGICAL TEAM from behind Naturally its the guy whos lugging the
ICE

CHEST full of OD STUs organs When the punchbowl strikes he GOES
DOWN HARD PITCHING the ice chest

at a pair of COPS who are over by the pifiata loading CONFISCATED
MONKEYBONE DOLLS into a SHOPPING CART The ICE CHEST knocks them off
their feet - and sends the SHOPPING CART rolling downhill

The COPS try to get up but they skid every which way on the SPILLED
ICE
underneath On top of which the SURGICAL TEAM is all over them

playing
GRAB-ASS with the COPS as they try to retrieve precious organs

The HEAD SURGEON kneels beside his fallen comrade the guy who got
BEANED by the punchbowl and feels for a pulse

HEAD SURGEON
Put him on ice I think he can still be saved

EXT ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON

COPS sprint downhill trying to intercept the runaway SHOPPING CART
full

of confiscated dolls Too late The CART slams into a fence and goes
ass-over-teakettle dumping its contents into the PENGUIN HABITAT

INT HYPS HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT

HYPNOS and an audience of DARKTOWNERS peer into the nightmare orb
They

see a Keystone-Cops vision of fur-clad ESKIMOS with clubs and
spearguns amid a colony of terrified PENGUINS

Not again THAT STINKING MONKEY

AERIAL SHOT - STUS POV - MOVING

STU gets an idea as he looks down at his dangling INTESTINE He begins
FEEDING IT OUT - giving himself more rope to work with - and when its
long enough begins SWINGING IT like a LASSO

-at the tiny CARS parked far far below They must be close toa
hundred feet up in the air - and all at once the ground is coming up
fast

EXT ZOO - ON JULIE and CROWD - LATE AFTERNOON

JULIE et al SCREAM IN HORROR as the two bodies plunge earthward

ON STU-BONE and OD STU - FALLING

and falling and falling until they SMACK INTO the hot asphalt of

Their BODIES have stopped - but their SPIRITS keep on falling
AERIAL SHOT - SKIES OVER DARK TOWN - NIGHT

and the fight continues - even into the afterlife As they plummet

down through the heavens they REVERT to their true personae Its STU
vs MONKEYBONE creator vs sidekick still duking it out - likea
couple of skydivers fighting over a single parachute
EXT STREETS - DARK TOWN - RIGHT

DARKTOWNERS pour into the streets to watch the epic struggle overhead
Theyre placing bets rooting their favorites on Then

THE GROUND SHAKES AND THUNDERS - and the DARKTOWNERS scatter in all
directions DIVING for the nearest hiding place They seem to know
what
this mighty rumbing signifies

The E-TICKET RIDE pops out of the ground - begins to RISE into the air
and a COLOSSUS appears beneath it A FIFTY-FOOT WARRIOR clad in
JAPANESE

CEREMONIAL ARMOR he TOWERS over Dark Town so mighty and enormous
that

he can wear the E-TICKET RIDE as a hat

ON STU AND MONKEYBONE - FALLING

STU lands a HAYMAKER and the two of them break loose of each other -

I dress up when I want to make an impression -
So howd it go

STU
Fine thanks Saw my girl said goodbye
everythings gonna be okay
(shrugging)
I guess Im yours now

MONKEYBONE
Death Id like to point out that none of this
was my fault The roots of this tragedy go back
to a callous uncaring society that -

DEATH lets out a MIGHTY ROAR and CLAPS HIS GREAT METAL HANDS together
Man and monkey are surely squished But when DEATH opens his hands
STU

is still there cupped safely in his palms
STU
Hey Wheres Monkeybone

DEATH

flick
of his finger Then he turns
