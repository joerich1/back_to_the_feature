and gets into another finally engaging a gunman at the

winch pins Riggs down with an automatic weapon Riggs
cant hit him and cant run when he sees the ships
metal gunwale converging behind the gunman Quickly
eyeballs the angles involved Aims the laser down the
gunwale FIRES Banks a slug off the steel Takes out
the gunman with a ricochet whereupon the ship runs
aground The abrupt stop topples cranes everything not
fastened down and tosses Riggs hard against a winch
knocking his gun away Remaining crew throw lines over

Leo regards the shark now motionless in the cockpit

LEO
I think the sharks asleep now

BOOM Another EXPLOSION up on the ships deck Murtaugh
looks up to see a burning OIL DRUM blown high into the
air He follows the drums trajectory

MURTAUGH
Oh shit Jump Leo

Murtaugh shoves Leo off the boat just as the heavy
fiery drum crushes it The boat instantly begins
sinking Murtaugh bobs near Leo looking on

MURTAUGH
My boat

As the boat goes down water begins to cover the shark
and revives it

LEO
I think the sharks awake again

MURTAUGH
Oh shit

Murtaugh and Leo begin stroking madly as the shark swims
free of the wreckage Leo urges himself on

LEO
Swim swim swim

Murtaugh sees the lifeboat still tied to the freighter
drifting behind it He swims over and climbs aboard
Then calls to Leo paddling frantically nearby --

MURTAUGH
Leo this way Over here

Leo sees Murtaugh alters course for the boat He
glances back The sharks coming for him

LEO
Agh Swim Swim Swim

The shark closes quickly on the little guy Its about
to nail him when Murtaugh grabs Leos shirt hauls him
into the lifeboat They tumble onto the floorboards

LEO
You see that Fucking shark

MURTAUGH
What you get for trying to take
his teeth

Murtaugh stands watches his boat sink from sight Beat

MURTAUGH

Murtaugh sees a Code 7 life ring floating next to the
lifeboat He picks it up All thats left of his boat

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Captain streaks PAST us and rounds a corner Behind
him Murtaugh catches and passes Riggs not a little
surprised to see him on the bike

EXT CHINATOWN MALL

The Captain runs into a glass-walled exterior elevator
just as the doors are closing Murtaugh SKIDS up a beat
later The doors close in his face Riggs sees this
Spots a flight of stairs Uses a bench and a moving
cart to vault to the first landing heads for level two

Murtaugh dumps the bike takes an alternate route using
an exterior escalator

INT ELEVATOR

The Captain looks out the glass back of the elevator and
sees Riggs bounding up the stairs behind him Realizes
Riggs will make the top about the same time Sees the
elevator next to his going down In desperation pulls
his GUN and BLOWS OUT the side WINDOW Other people in
the elevator scream in terror as he climbs out the
window and leaps onto the top of the descending elevator

Riggs reacts to this and must now run back down a flight
and leap over the railing In front of him only yards
away the Captain jumps from the elevator He lands
losing his gun then gets up and takes off again with
Riggs in pursuit

Murtaugh meanwhile seeing whats happened has reached
a landing and now must turn and go down the up
escalator Shouts at the people in front of him

MURTAUGH
Look out Out of the way

Murtaugh reaches level ground jumps on the bike again
and takes off

Fathers in the head Fan kills him before he SHOOTS
the oldest Father and the pit viper (Kus father)
Hits him with a BURST And all hell breaks loose

The battle pits the Triad against Riggs Murtaugh
Butters Ng Tony and the PRC Army It rapidly
divides into separate skirmishes that sometimes

overlap Its a war Most important were counting
the bullets The PRC guys have at most three thirty-
five round mags In real life set on full auto that
goes fast The Triad guys are slightly less well-armed
Riggs Murtaugh et al have their pistols and a couple
extra mags each What this means is as people run out
of ammo theyre first diving after dead guys guns and
then theyre going to hands and feet and whatever they
can grab to hit with or throw The gun battle will
transform into a realistic martial arts melee

During the fight

Kus goals to protect the two remaining Four Fathers
and get them out In the process he takes on multiple
opponents armed and not

We see the two remaining Four Fathers martial arts
skills on display

Riggs suffers an early flesh wound It slows him but
doesnt stop him

Tonys killed Ng and Butters both nail the shooter

Riggs and Murtaugh end up behind the stack of renminbi
Out of breath Nicked here and there As they check
their ammo --

MURTAUGH

hole in his side)

MURTAUGH

Kids are outta the house these
days

Beat Then more GUNFIRE This time theyre driven
from cover and have to split up

In the midst of the fighting Riggs meets Ng

NG
How we doing

RIGGS
You got me

They spot Ku and the pit viper moving by in the distance

RIGGS
Whos the guy in the white
pajamas

NG

Names Wah Sing Ku The Four
Father with hims his real dad

RIGGS
Like Four Father like son
huh Im gonna go see if I
can break up the family

Riggs heads off in Kus direction

Across the room Murtaugh FIRES TWO of his four when
a Triad guy he doesnt see draws a bead on him FIRES

And suddenly Butters is there Knocks Murtaugh
down Takes the bullet himself Murtaugh comes off
the ground POPS the shooter and moves to Butters

MURTAUGH
Butters

BUTTERS
Hey you said my real name

The wound shouldnt kill him

MURTAUGH
Dont move

BUTTERS
This is the first time Ive been
shot Am I okay

MURTAUGH
(sees Ng)
Ng
(indicates Butters)
Watch him

Ng comes over as Murtaugh moves on Checks the cylinder
as he goes One bullet left when the old Four Father
is there Drives a kick into Murtaughs kidneys A

monkey fist in the neck Murtaugh fights unconsciousness

Sees him moving in again Finds a paint spray gun at
hand Sees the old mans glasses Sprays A pink mist
covers the lenses The old guy has to take them off
Losing his glasses doesnt change his kung fu -- its as
good as ever -- its just now all his blowsre landing
half a foot short Which Murtaugh realizes Stays out
of range Waits for an opening Then clonks him with
the butt of his revolver

Riggs FIRES his last two Meets Chu mano-a-mano 130

Chu makes Riggs suffer when a PRC Army guy appears
and takes Chu out A moment of acknowledgement between
him and Riggs Then Ku and his father end the moment
Strike like a lightning Ku drops Riggs as the father
kills the soldier Ku moves to kill Riggs with a punch

Across the room Murtaugh sees Ku about to kill Riggs
Raises his GUN Its a long shot Murtaugh pauses
Cricks his neck FIRES

An instinct alerts Ku He sees Murtaugh fire Moves just
enough to avoid the slug Murtaugh keeps pulling the
trigger The hammer falling on empty chambers Ku
senses something behind him Turns to find his fathers
taken Murtaughs slug and bleeds profusely from the hole
it made in his pericardium Ku moves to him Catches him
as he falls Supports him as he heads for a door Finds
himself engaged by a PRC soldier Dispatches him despite
the burden of his fathers body And exits

Murtaugh moves to Riggs Theyre both bruised and beat-up
Exhausted The battles basically over Bodies everywhere
Murtaugh hoists Riggs to his feet

MURTAUGH
Cmon
EXT NATIONAL ANSCO WAREHOUSE

Out on a fucked-up old pier Ku supporting his father
as he looks for an escape when the father sags drops
to the ground Ku bends over him Their eyes meet
They hold the look for a long time Father and son
And then the fathers eyes roll back

A DOOR BANGS OPEN a SHORT DISTANCE AWAY Riggs and
Murtaugh stumble out of the warehouse See Ku kneeling
next to the body Bowed His brow touching his fathers

Ku lifts his head Sees Riggs and Murtaugh Ku has
nothing left to live for now Nothing except to kill the
two men responsible for his failure for his fathers
death Ku stands Starts walking toward them Slowly
Inexorably

Riggs and Murtaugh watch as Ku approaches Theyre alone
Theyre out of bullets Theyre shot up tired and
generally hurting

MURTAUGH
Since I met you Ive done a
lotta hairy shit cause somebody
had to back you up But it aint
gonna happen now Im gonna be
a grandfather and you and Lorna
are gonna have a baby He aint
worth dying for Riggs

The two men hold a long look Beat SIRENS APPROACH
IN the DISTANCE

RIGGS
Cavalrys coming anyway
And this guy wont get far We
can always track him down
sometime when we have a

howitzer Your son-in-laws
in there Lets get him and
get out

Murtaughs not a little relieved They turn start off

RIGGS
Were too old for this shit

MURTAUGH
Guys just too damn good

RIGGS
Yeah he took my gun apart for
Christs sake How the helld
he do that

A132

131

MURTAUGH
Yeah How did he

They keep walking Two more steps Then stop Look at
each other Its a long look Murtaugh sighs

MURTAUGH
Yeah okay lets go ask him

They turn back Start walking toward Ku Ku keeps
coming The distance closes Then in English--

- No tomorrow

And Riggs and Murtaugh charge Ku knocks them both
down Then theyre up And the fights on

What follows goes beyond what weve seen so far Ku has
the skill Riggs and Murtaugh have the heart and the will
Kus methodical theyre animal unstructured spitting
tearing howling And taking massive punishment When
Kus about to deliver the death blow to Murtaugh Riggs
intercedes Murtaugh does the same for Riggs barreling
into Ku Fighting the way a grizzly fights The
battles nasty brutish and long

Murtaughs beaten a mess In the end its up to

Riggs To reach deeper into himself than he already has
To become despite age and attrition something he once
was Insane For all or zero Twelve years melt away
This is the kid who jumped off buildings and killed

Mr Joshua The demon-product of an idiotic war and dark
memories and desperation The Lethal Weapon

Its not that Riggs is finally better than Ku Hes
just switched into a gear Ku isnt expecting Taking
punishment Ku and we would never think possible
Driving Ku back Unleashing all his fury when
Murtaugh suddenly spears Ku with a piece of steel rebar
Front to back Ku knocks Murtaugh unconscious for it
Hed kill Murtaugh next If Riggs didnt grab the bar

a hand on either end and whip Ku around Riggs doesnt
let go either Grips the steel tight uses it to maneuver
Ku and inflict massive pain when suddenly Ku flicks
his foot over his own shoulder and stuns Riggs And the
two men tumble off the pier

UNDERWATER A132
Riggs and Ku sink to the bottom still locked in battle

lit by the headlights of a car that Chu has driven off

the pier after being shot dead trying to escape

A132

B132

A132

The odds shift back into Kus favor again Hes nailed
Riggs with the kick and now begins to punish him underwater
not caring if he himself dies as long as Riggs dies
too when Riggs hand finds an AK-47 inside the car
with Chu He pulls it out Sticks it in Kus belly

Ku tries to shove the barrel away And Riggs OPENS UP

on FULL AUTO GUN flashes light silt-stirred water

Shell casings eject in SLO-MO through fluid resistance
And a magazine of AK SLUGS RIP UP Kus guts Blood fills
the water Kus eyes meet Riggs Then his hand releases
the gun barrel And Ku drifts to the harbor floor
Riggs doesnt see him hit though Hes heading topside
for oxygen

EXT PIER B132

Riggs breaks the surface Gasping for air Hes won
To Ku somewhere below him--

RIGGS
No tomorrow for you asshole

He swims to a ladder fixed to a piling Grabs a rung
Starts to hoist himself out when Ku explodes up out of
the water Whips the garrote in his Buddhist prayer
beads over Riggs head and draws it tight

The wire bites into Riggs neck The weight of Kus bloody
body pulls on him Riggs white-knuckles the rung with one
hand tries to fight Ku off with the other We see a
ladder begin to pull away from the rotting wood and
concrete of the pier when Riggs finds the rebar still
sticking through Kus side and yanks it out The searing
pain causes Ku to loosen the garrote slightly Enough for
Riggs to get the rebar wedged inside it To slide the
rebar up alongside his face and begin to lever the garrote
away from his neck Slowly he manages to slide the wire
noose up over his head And then in a sudden reversal
whips the loop off his own head and back over Kus The
ladders hanging by a bolt now Riggs tightens the
garrote around Kus neck As the last bolt holding the
ladder lets go Riggs whips the garrote around a steel
hook protruding from the ladders side and the ladder
still connected to a large chunk of concrete drops into
the depths carrying Ku with it He wont be coming

back from that one Whereupon Riggs reaches up for a
piece of concrete and rebar hanging off the pier Grabs
it And it breaks away on top of him And Riggs too
is gone Plunged to the bottom Not coming up

On the pier Murtaugh comes to Looks around No one

B132

B132

MURTAUGH
Riggs

He drags himself to his feet

MURTAUGH
Riggs

Murtaugh moves to the dry dock Small waves are still
rebounding off the walls But thats all No bubbles
When the waves disappear its just still black water
Murtaugh screams now looking down into the water

MURTAUGH
Where are you Riggs

Nothing Moving along the edge of the dry dock now
still calling down into the water --

MURTAUGH
Tell me where you are Riggs
Will it to me Will it to me

Riggs Tell me where you are
Riggs Will it to me Will
it to me

Beat Beat Murtaughs eyes suddenly swing to a spot in
the water Like hes heard something He runs A few
strides along the edge Then dives to the spot

UNDERWATER 132

Murtaugh swims down Deeper and deeper and

there next to Kus dead body and the ladder is Riggs
Pinned under the large chunk of concrete and steel
Breath running out Desperate eyes bugged pleading with
Murtaugh Its hopeless for Murtaugh to try and shift
such an enormous weight Except that Murtaughs gonna
try Gets his hands under the concrete Plants his feet
on the bottom of the dry dock Lifts Strains Maxes
every fiber in his body Muscles burning from oxygen
debt until the mass slowly begins to move More
and more And then Riggs is free Murtaugh hauls his
friend up toward the dim moonlight shimmering above them

EXT PIER 133

They break the surface Suck air and choke water
Alive Barely Murtaugh holding Riggs up so he can
breathe Tears in Murtaughs eyes as he holds him

MURTAUGH
I heard you Riggs I heard
you I heard you
