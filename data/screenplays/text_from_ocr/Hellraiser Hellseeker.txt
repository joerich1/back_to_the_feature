She checks the directions on her map

KIRSTY
It’s been a long timeI think we’re
lost

TREVOR

What are you talking about

KIRSTY
We missed a turn We should have crossed
a bridge by now

TREVOR
Relax Just give me the map

He reaches for the map Takes his eye off the road for a
split second When he turns back it’s too late

( )
Salmon 2

Out of nowhere there’s a GOAT (the most exotic one available
in Vancouver for scale) -- weird twisted antlers --
standing in the middle of the road and they’re-

ROARING DOWN on top of it

KIRSTY
Aaahhhh

Trevor cuts the wheel hard TOO HARD The car swerves out of
control

And guess what NOW WE SEE THE BRIDGE
INTEXT CAR - DAY
The rest is a blur

» Trevor loses control of the steering wheel Kirsty
SCREAMS Their car skids toward the bridge guardrail

( )
Salmon 3

Trevor cranks the wheel hard and loses control They skid off
the road The car launches out over the river soaring toward
the water below

Trevor and Kirsty brace themselves The car hits the
surface

INT RIVER UNDERWATER — DAY

Inside the car Trevor and Kirsty panic They scramble to get
their seat belts off The car is sinking fast Trevor breaks
free and swims over to help Kirsty He yanks on her seat
belt It’s stuck

Water rushes into the car Trevor takes one last breath
before the car is completely filled

He desperately fights to free Kirsty but-

- He’s running out of air He has to leave her But only for
a moment He swims out through the driver side door Pushes
off the car with his feet to launch himself towards the
surface accidently kicking the door shut

EXT RIVER - DAY

Trevor breaks the surface and gasps for air Getting his
bearings he takes a deep breath and dives back under for his
wife

INT RIVER UNDERWATER — DAY

Trevor reaches the car again but the driver side door is shut
-- and it’s jammed shut

Through the window he sees Kirsty panicking then finally
freeing herself from the belt

She swims to the driver window Pounds on the glass

Trevor reels back and kicks the window It won’t budge
Kirsty’s eyes are now wide with desperation breath
quickening sinking fast but She’s trapped

She can’t hold out any longer She stops fighting Knows it’s
over She empties her lungs of air mouthing the words “ I

love you” then sinks back into the car

Trevor screams-

INT HOSPITAL ERTREVOR’S BED - DAY

TREVOR
Kirsty

Trevor leaps up into frame His eyes dart around the room
WIDER Now we realize we’re inside a hospital room

TREVOR
Kirsty

His eyes dart around the room trying to get his bearings
when suddenly a woman is standing in front of him

DR ALLISON DORMERE A simple beauty Something about her
just radiates a calming presence She speaks softly

ALLISON
Everything’s gonna’ be fine

TREVOR
Where’s Kirsty

ALLISON
It’s OK Trevor you’re safe here

TREVOR
Where’s my wife

Allison holds up a hypodermic needle

ALLISON
This will help you relax

It hits him quick and hard His vision starts to blur and
distort slowly taking us to BLACK

INT HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOMTREVOR’S BED - DAY

FADE UP FROM BLACK Trevor’s vision starts to clear But
something about the room is a little off

CLOSE ON TREVORS FACE as he struggles to move -- but its
useless

A TIGHT STRAP pins his jaw against his chest His arms and
legs are also strapped down

He hears a sickening SAWING noise and his eyes bulge in
horror

( )
Salmon 5

Tight on a few ODD SURGEONS working on something in front of
them One Surgeon finishes his work Lifts up a small dremel
power saw with his bloodied hands and hands it to one of the
INTERNS

More tools are passed back and forth in front of Trevor’s
face

WIDE as the doctors calmly lift a 4” x 5” piece of Trevors
freshly sawed cranium from his head exposing his brain

TREVOR
What are you people doing

A FROWNING NURSE peeks into Trevor’s eyeline

NURSE
Try to stay calm Trevor It’s vital that
you stay very still

The CHIEF SURGEON -- a large unshaven man with yellowed
teeth and swollen gums -- walks up He swings a large
magnifying lens in front of his face making his eyes
enormous and his face grotesquely distorted

He’s handed a tray of evenly arranged pins He cranks up the
magnification of his lenses which make his eyes appear even
larger

The Chief Surgeon takes one of the pins and gently pushes it
into Trevors frontal lobe

TREVOR
Whats happening to-

Trevors eyes glaze over and his jaw relaxes

CHIEF SURGEON
I’ve just accessed the speech center
temporarily shutting down all verbal
functions

The Chief Surgeon takes several more pins from the tray
Lectures to the INTERNS gathered around him

CHIEF SURGEON
As you can see the thinnest layer of
cortex separates the part of the brain
that feels pleasure from the part of the
brain that feels pain

The Chief Surgeon slips another pin into Trevors exposed
brain

( )
Salmon 5A

CHIEF SURGEON
Our goal today is find the exact point in
the brain where moral decisions are made
the place where right and wrong is
distinguished

(MORE)

( )
8A

Salmon 6 CHIEF SURGEON(contd)

In exploring this “Morality Center”I will

be triggering memories -- disrupting the
unconscious --
His voice lowers and his eyes turn solid black -- like the

eyes of a shark The eye magnification is now at a hideous
level His black cornea fills the frame

CHIEF SURGEON
So our patient may experience some
distress during the procedure
Trevor looks at the frowning nurse who is watching over him
The Chief Surgeon sticks a needle into another spot on
Trevors brain

TREVORS POV The nurse is suddenly a pale gargoyle with
blackened eyes Trevor opens his mouth to scream and-

CUT TO
INT HOSPITAL ERTREVOR’S BED - DAY 8A

-IN A BURST OF WHITE LIGHT ALLISON is now standing before
him She is bathed in a haze of white light

ALLISON
Well What do say Trevor Que pasa

Trevor relaxes His bindings are gone The Gargoyle Nurse is
gone The Surgeons are gone

He grabs his head All in one piece But something remains
The pain His head is pounding

TREVOR
Where do I start
ALLISON
Hows the old noggin Any change in the

intensity

She touches him gently He desperately tries to get her into
focus

ALLISON
Can you describe the pain

Now he can see her clearly It’s Allison
TREVOR

Like there’s a jackhammer being jammed
into the back of my eyes

( )
Salmon 7

She picks up a pad and scribbles something on it

ALLISON
I’m Doctor Dormere You can call me
Allison

TREVOR
Are you a dream too

ALLISON
Still hallucinating as well Hmm

TREVOR
What just happened It looked like a
dream but it felt so -- real

ALLISON
Its probably the morphine Trevor Youre
on such a high dosage you could be
asleep and dreaming with your eyes wide
open We’re still going to have to runa
few more tests over the next couple of
days and see if we can pinpoint what’s
causing those headaches With the kind of
head trauma you suffered you’re lucky to
be here at all

They share a gentle moment

ALLISON
I’1l see you through this

TREVOR
I’1l take your word on that

AN OLDER DOCTOR walks in AMBROSE He grabs Trevors chart

AMBROSE
Hello Trevor Let’s see how we’re doing
today

ALLISON

(to Ambrose)
He’s still a little hazy and in a lot of
pain -- even after the morphine
Blackouts Hallucinations Acute memory
loss I recommend we admit him until we
run the rest of the tests -- just to be
safe

Ambrose puts the chart back

( )
Salmon 8

AMBROSE
Well I don’t see any abnormalities
ALLISON
Exactly that’s the problem that’s why I
think-
AMBROSE

(looking up at Trevor)
Time to ween you off those painkillers
too Wouldnt want you getting hooked
Start coming to the hospital for no
other reason than to get a fix And we
can’t have that

Then it hits him all over again He looks straight into
Ambrose’s eyes

TREVOR
Wheres Kirsty Wheres my wife

LANGE
That’s what I’d like to know

Ambrose and Trevor turn to the door to find DETECTIVE MICHAEL
LANGE One of those instantly everybody’s friend kind of guys
standing there

LANGE
(off their looks)
I knocked
INT HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

Trevor sits on a bench in a long empty hallway It’s quiet
Maybe too quiet Lange steps in with two cups of coffee

LANGE
Hope you like it black
(takes a sip of his)
And tasting like crap

Trevor just holds his Doesn’t take a sip Trevor is far from
here His look is distant

TREVOR
She’s missing

Lange looks a little confused

( )
Salmon 9

LANGE
It’s not like we’re gonna stop looking I
don’t give up that easy We just have to -
- keep searching

TREVOR
Maybe if I took you back Walked you
through it

LANGE

(more confused)
We’ve done that already

Now it’s Trevor’s turn to be confused He tries to process
what Lange just said

LANGE
(off Trevors look)
You sure you’re okay to drive

Trevor gives him a look

TREVOR
I do know I don’t have a car anymore

LANGE
Look I obviously caught you at a bad
time Go home get some rest
(a little laugh)
You look like hell warmed over

Lange gets up and walks away He stops and turns back
LANGE
One more thing You said you tried to
pull her out through the passenger door
but it was locked right

TREVOR
Yeah

Lange looks at his note pad
LANGE
That’s strange The report says the doors

were open when they pulled the car out of
the river

TREVOR
Maybe she unlocked it -- and got out

An awkward beat

( )

Salmon 10

LANGE
Maybe
(his pager goes off)

Oh well I’11 double check that Could be

their bad Gotta’ run We’ll talk soon
Lange puts the pad away
LANGE
Sure you don’t need a lift
(takes a hit of nasal spray)
Suit yourself
INT BUS - NIGHT

Trevor is sitting on the bus He’s a little out of

Loud music plays on a portable CD from the seat in
him

A CREEPY OLD WOMAN sits further back knitting

it

front of

Trevor rubs his temples the headaches are annoying- so is

the loud music

TREVOR
Do you mind keeping it down

The man turns around Trevor locks eyes with a UNUSUAL
LOOKING MAN COVERED WITH FACIAL PIERCINGS The man’s tattoos

cover his neck and chin

TREVOR (CONT’D)
The music do you mind turning it down

The man turns around NO change in the volume

Trevor turn’s back to the Old Woman knitting Suddenly she’s

in super SLOW-MO and then we are-

EXT TREVOR’S APT BUILDING - NIGHT

Trevor steps off the bus and walks through his neighborhood
A neighborhood on it’s way back from being a shit hole

We follow him from behind -- a little off kilter

ROAR SNAP A PITBULL’S snout ends up inches from Trevors
leg as it launches forward and is yanked to a stop by it’s

chain

( )
Salmon 10A

Trevor rears back pinned against the wall The dog suddenly
seems to recognize Trevor backs off and wags it’s tail
Trevor cautiously leans over Looks at the tag on the collar

TREVOR
Hey Cotton Good boy

( )

14A

Salmon 11

Something gets knocked over behind Trevor He spins

HIS POV back down the street Nothing’s there THEN HE HEARS
FOOT STEPS He heads back to investigate He reaches the

corner and looks both ways Nothing Strange

He continues on his way

INT TREVORS APT - NIGHT 12
A nice loft space gone to hell It had a woman’s touch -- a
long time ago Dirty dishes dirty clothes Like a frat house

on Saturday morning

Trevor steps in genuinely surprised at the condition of the
place He starts to clean up Picks up a tipped over picture

HIS POV of a photo of Kirsty and him from happier times Big
smiles A nice moment

INT TREVORS APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT 13
Hand-held super eight-ish type footage (digital video)

It’s a few years ago Happier times It’s the day they moved
into the apartment

A montage of images as they cuddle affectionately in bed
Trevor strokes Kirsty’s face brushes her hair from her eyes
She caresses his chest as they tenderly kiss They are lost

in the moment - in each other

INT TREVOR’S APT - NIGHT 14

Back to scene Trevor still staring at the photo now
sitting in his favorite E-Z Chair A bitter-sweet smile

EXT CUBIC ROUTE - ESTABLISHING - DAY 14A
A curious building stands out along the skyline

INT CUBIC ROUTE HALLWAY - DAY 15
Trevor -- who’s seen better days -- walks past a sign on the
wall “CUBIC ROUTE ACTUARIAL RESEARCH” and marches down a long
white sterile hallway lit by harsh fluorescent tubes His

eyes can’t seem to adjust to them

INT CUBIC ROUTE TREVORS CUBICLE - DAY 16
A maze of cubicles More harsh fluorescence It’s a mill of

data research and number crunching with “worker bees”
endlessly TAPPING away at their computers

( )
Salmon 12

Trevor enters and is met with a number of stares from his co-
workers as he marches through the honeycomb of cubicles He
struggles to remember where his cubicle is and-

“Why the fuck is everybody staring at me”

Somebody blocks Trevor’s path Gets in Trevor’s face This is
BRET SPINER Trevor’s cubicle neighbor

BRET
Well look who decided to show up today

TREVOR
Hey-
(takes him a second to put a
name with the face)
- Bret

BRET
Banker’s hours Nice Hey what happened
to you yesterday

TREVOR
I was in a-

BRET
- You got a piece of ass didn’t you
That’s why you didn’t come back from
lunch Secret’s safe with me pal
(winks )
Well just call it a “personal”day

Bret’s just met with a blank stare

BRET
Look forget I said anything Just get
some numbers going -- any numbers at all

will due The hills have eyes remember
Bret gestures to a surveillance camera overhead

BRET
We’re all here for you Trev

Bret walks over to his cubicle Trevor turns and stares
straight ahead

HIS POV of a CORKBOARD with dozens of notes and messages
tacked to it He starts to flip through them when one in
particular catches his attention

A YELLOWED BUSINESS CARD that simply reads-

( )

Salmon 13

“ALL PROBLEMS SOLVED” He plucks it off There’s an address
scribbled on the back

FLASH CUT -- A MEMORY HIT

INT KIRCHER IMPORTS WAREHOUSE- DAY 17

A SMOKY ROOM-

The BUSINESS CARD “ALL PROBLEMS SOLVED” being slid across a
desk -- we don’t see by who Trevor picks it up Curious He
smiles and slides some money back across the desk

BACK TO SCENE

INT CUBIC ROUTE TREVORS CUBICLE- DAY 18

A JOLT OF PAIN rips through Trevor’s head forcing him to
drop into his chair Bret peeks over the cubicle

BRET
Sixty five percent of all headaches are
due to low blood sugar levels Trev

A light bulb seems to go off over Trevors head

INT CUBIC ROUTEBREAK ROOM - DAY 19

Trevor eyes a vending machine He peruses the sundry sugary
snacks looking for just the right fix

Harsh lighting There’s an old dart board against the wall

Its dead quiet in here We can hear his head pounding in
pain A couple of the fluorescent bulbs over his head flicker
weakly He shuts his eyes

When Trevor opens his eyes again the room has gotten
considerably darker

The light is just dim enough now so that he cant see whats
in the vending machine He goes right up to the glass and
peers into the machine using his hand as a visor The strain
on his eyes intensifies his headache

Kirsty SLAMS UP AGAINST THE GLASS INSIDE THE MACHINE Now we
realizes that the machine is filled with water

She FLOATS there POUNDING HER HANDS AGAINST THE GLASS
trying to get out

( )
Salmon

Trevor JOLTS BACKWARDS Kirsty IS GONE He whirls around-

GWEN
See anything you like

Trevor leaps back up against the machine

GWEN
Well do you Jesus what the hell was
that

Trevor scrambles for an answer Nothing’s coming

GWEN
(angrily)
Come on speak up Im trying to run a
business here I cant have people hiding
out in the break room when they should be
slaving away at their desks

TREVOR
Sorry I just kind of spaced for a
second there

GWEN
Well dont let it happen again
(Devilish smile)
Or I may have to spank you

Gwen pushes Trevor back against the vending machine Before

he can react shes kissing him -- hard He struggles to free

himself

GWEN
You’re not getting away that easy

She traps him again

TREVOR
Please I don’t know

GWEN
How do you think you got this promotion
(cozying up to him)
Mmm Im still tingling all over from the
last time

Trevor has no idea what she’s talking about Gwen strokes his

face

( )

Salmon 15

GWEN
Whats wrong Trev It’s me Gwen
(grabs him)
I know what you like
Trevor gently pushes her off him again

TREVOR
Please this is a little too fast for me

GWEN
Don’t tell me Mario Andretti is trying to
give me a speeding ticket

TREVOR
Gwen my wifes dead

GWEN
I know-
(something clicks behind her
eyes)
- it’s perfect
QUICK FLASHES
Kirstys hand pounding on the windshield
The car sinking into the lake
The OLD MAN with a bright ORNATE RING
FLASHBACK
INT TREVOR’S APARTMENT- NIGHT 20

Two NAKED BODIES slamming against each other ending in full
on climax

Finally over the images of erotica we hear Gwens voice as
one of the characters

GWEN (VO)
Yeah Trevor that’s it That’s
it
END FLASHBACK
INT CUBIC ROUTEBREAK ROOM- DAY 21

Trevor is now locking lips with a very AGGRESSIVE Gwen His
hand is up her skirt He snaps out of it and pulls back

Salmon 16

TREVOR
Jesus Christ
(panicked)
What the hell are we doing

GWEN
Nothing we haven’t done before
(real seductive)
Well pick this up later
(heads for the door)
Now get some fucking work done

She points to a surveillance camera on the wall

GWEN (CONTD)
We’re watching you

And with that she’s gone Trevor is frozen there “What the
fuck just happened”

INT CUBIC ROUTETREVORS CUBICLE - DAY 22

Trevor walks back to his cubicle still a little confused A
PING from his computer announces he has an INTEROFFICE MEMO-
FILE ATTACHED Trevor goes to the mailbox on his screen
clicks

Up comes a QUICKTIME MOVIE It’s video surveillance footage
of Gwen all over Trevor in the Break Room

Trev looks around his cubicle Takes another look at the
QUICKTIME MOVIE He stands up and peers across the outer
office looking for Gwen He sits back down Embarrassed
Trevor closes the attachment -- at least for now

TREVORS PHONE RINGS Startles him(and us) He picks it up

TREVOR
Hello
LANGE
(from phone)
Trevor -- this is Detective Lange Its

about your wife

INT POLICE STATIONLANGES OFFICE- DAY 23

A run of the mill police station DETECTIVE LANGE plagued
with a chronic case of post nasal drip sits at his desk

Trevor sits across from him Behind Trevor is another empty
desk As Lange speaks he SNIFFS wetly every so often

( )

Salmon

LANGE
(to Trevor)
Thanks for coming down How’s that head
of yours feeling

TREVOR
Wheres my wife

Lange takes out nasal drops and squeezes some in each nostril

as he spea

Lange sees

ks

LANGE
We still havent been able to locate her
although missing persons turned up some
evidence that suggests foul play may have
been involved

TREVOR
Foul play

LANGE
For one thing there were no skid marks on
the bridge the tires were all intactand
from what we can tell there’s nothing
wrong internally with the vehicle either
It’s like the car was driven off the
bridge intentionally

TREVOR
I just lost control There was this --
animal -- in the middle of the road-

it noted in the report

LANGE
Yeah a goat or something

TREVOR
I swerved and we went off the bridge I
tried to get her out but I couldn’t

LANGE
Look We’re at a real stalemate here
until we find her Is there anything that
might have happened just before that
accident that you haven’t mentioned

( )

Salmon 18

TREVOR
(offended)
Look I’ve told you everything that I
remember

LANGE
Hey don’t take it the wrong way I’m just
a guy doing my job here OK I mean
between your head injury and the fact
that you’re still on some very strong
pain medication you might be forgetting
a few details about the crash that could
help us-
Lange takes a deep hit of the nasal spray
LANGE
And everything you have told us could
just be the medication talking That’s
all
CLOSE ON TREVORS FACE as he wrestles with this notion
LANGE
So well be revisiting things a lot
around here It’s boring it’s a pain in
the ass but it’s what we do
FLASH BACK
INT CAMRY (MOVING) —- DAY 24

split second

He cuts the wheel hard TOO HARD The car swerves out of

Trevor desperately trying to free Kirsty

Salmon 19

Trevor blinks and looks around him Lange is sitting just
where they were when he saw him last Only now theres a very
wary look on his face Whoa

TREVOR
Sorry Just trying to remember

Lange nods

TREVOR
She was trapped inside

LANGE
Well apparently she got out And there in
lies the problem I won’t keep you If we
have any more questions youll get a call
from myself or my partner Detective
Givens

Lange stands and backs up awkwardly to a file behind his
desk Trevor stares at him suspiciously

TREVOR
You guys know something I dont

LANGE
All things considered -- we probably know
a lot less than you do Have a good

afternoon

Trevor exits both men maintain eye contact as the door
closes between him

EXT TREVOR’S APT -— NIGHT 26

The bus pulls up to the curb Trevor climbs out and starts
walking down the empty street As soon as the bus pulls away
the only sound heard is Trevors footsteps

POV BEHIND TREVOR We see Trevors back from a slight
distance Someone is following him

Sensing this Trevor looks behind him Nothing but an empty
sidewalk

Trevor hurries his pace almost there at his apartment
building He glances behind him again Nope nobody there

Trevor takes his usual walk home He looks for his friendly
PITBULL

TREVOR
Cotton where are you buddy

( )

Salmon 20

COTTON steps out of the shadows cautiously whimpering a
little

TREVOR
What’s wrong buddy

Cotton is looking past Trevor Trevor turns and finds-

-A DARK FIGURE standing at the end of the street Just
staring at him Watching him

TREVOR
Can I help you

No response Trevor’s getting a little aggravated

TREVOR
I said can I help you

The Dark Figure races off

TREVOR
Hey

Trevor takes off after him but loses him at the corner Shit
He turns and heads towards his apartment

OMITTED 27

INT TREVOR’S APT - NIGHT 28
Trevor walks into his apartment which he regards as strangely
unfamiliar As he glances around the room An EERIE LIGHT

out his window urges him to investigate He draws the curtain
open and GASPS

HIS POV THROUGH THE WINDOW

EXT HOTEL- NIGHT 29

Staring back at him from a dimly lit window in the apartment
building across the street is-

- the DARK FIGURE that Trevor saw on the street The light in
the window winks out rendering it dark again

Trevor can still see the Dark Figure in the darkness still
gazing at him “What the fuck”

Salmon 21

INT TREVORS APARTMENT— NIGHT 30

Trevor looks a little sick all of a sudden like he cant
breathe

THE BELL FROM A DISTANT CATHEDRAL begins to peel BONG
BONG BONG

Trevor opens his mouth to draw in a breath but instead spits
out a massive amount of water BONG BONG BONG

Trevor falls to the ground arms and legs thrashing heaving
up mouthfuls of water Trevor is drowning BONG BONG
BONG

In the puddles of water we see bits of debris leaves
pebbles a little mud etc

A hideous EEL-LIKE CREATURE launches it’s head out of
Trevors gaping mouth -- slithers toward him across the
floor Trevor backs against the wall

-THE RINGING BELL STOPS ABRUPTLY

Trevor sucks in a lung full of air

He’s completely dry again He looks around taking in what
just happened

The BING-BONG of his doorbell startles him

Trevor gets the door to find a young GOTH WOMAN on the other
side Long black hair Pale skinned Dark lipstick and
eyeliner -- but nothing too extreme Her name is TAWNY

Trevor clearly doesn’t recognize her

TAWNY
Here it is what do you think

She lifts up her shirt to just below her breasts
Trevor looks down at her slightly pudgy stomach A very
INTRICATE TATTOO forms an arrow that disappears just below
the waist of her jeans

TAWNY

Almost got one on my ass but I think this
is sexier

Salmon

TREVOR
(uncomfortable)
Its definitely nice

TAWNY
(a knowing wink)
I knew you’d like it

He realizes he’s just been staring at her this whole time
Snaps out of it

TREVOR
Im sorry Ive just been having a weird
day so I think I’m just gonna
straighten out the place a little and

kick back
She looks past him into his apartment

TAWNY
Definitely missing the woman’s touch it
used to have Well if you feel like
talking

tattoo)

She jabs a thumb down the hall behind her

TAWNY
Just knock

clothes are still hanging there He runs his hand along one

of her dresses Sniffs it Remembers her scent Smiles

Looking up he see a few boxes He reaches up high to grab
one He can’t quite reach

From above we see a NICKEL PLATED PISTOL He doesn’t

On his tip toes he reaches for a box full of VHS tapes all
hand-labeled Kirsty and TREVOR WEDDING VIDEO

INT TREVORS APT — NIGHT 32

He puts one in the VCR hits play Its his FIRST WEDDING

Trevor watches the video and smiles for the first time

The wedding portion of the tape ends and a not-so-clean edit
takes us into the honeymoon

CLOSE ON THE TV SCREEN VIDEO FOOTAGE-
INT HOTEL ROOM- NIGHT 33

Trevor holds the camera on Kirsty who is under the covers in
a generic hotel room She looks into camera as Trevor
arranges the composition There’s a coldness between the two

KIRSTY
You are obsessed with that thing

Trevor adjusts the zoom and focus

KIRSTY
Well other than the misfortune of our car
breaking down in the middle of nowhere

hallway

TREVOR

him Startles him

GWEN

Salmon 26

She pushes him inside toward the chair in the middle of the
room and sits him in it

GWEN
The innocent bit is getting old Shoe

Gwen puts one foot on his chest

GWEN

Trevor pulls the shoe off

GWEN

SMASH CUT TO

a VIDEO CAMERA on a tripod taping Gwen kissing Trevor on the
easy chair

The cable from the camera runs all the way to the TV where WE
SEE whats happening as well

Its intense Gwen is on top Gwen aggressively pulls
Trevors shirt off then goes for his belt Trevor suddenly
grabs her hands

GWEN
Youre kidding me

( )
Salmon 27

TREVOR
Im sorry Gwen I just cant

Gwen climbs off the chair and throws her jacket back on

GWEN
You have definitely got a screw loose

Stuffing her feet in her shoes

GWEN
You just lost your bonus

Gwens out the door Trevor looks relieved

He’s about to turn the TV off and stow away his camera He
looks at the TV and freezes

THE IMAGE ON THE TV shows that Gwen is still there
undressing Video Trevor and he’s giving in kissing her
back pulling her clothes off

Real Trevor looks at the camera The red “record”light is
flashing Trevor turns back to the TV -

TREVOR
What the hell

He waves a hand in front of the camera and his hand actually
appears on the TV in front of the sex image

Trevor and Gwen make love in the video Video Trevor turns to
the camera (to Trevor) and gives a menacing smile

Video Trevor looks back up at Gwen who smiles down at him
carnivorously She licks her lips

A MALE CENOBITE and a FEMALE CENOBITE appear to walk out from
the walls in the video Freakish but somehow incredibly sexy
at the same time

Real Trevor pans the camera in their direction and they are
GONE He pans the camera back to Gwen

VIDEO GWEN
Theres one thing I should have told you
right from the beginning Trevor

VIDEO TREVOR
What’s that

VIDEO GWEN
I like it pretty rough

Salmon 28

Suddenly TWO HANDS REACH INTO FRAME and-

- SLAP A PLASTIC BAG OVER GWEN’S HEAD yanking it tight
around her throat She keeps riding Trevor as she starts to
suffocate totally loving the rush

TREVOR SCREAMS-—

INT HOSPITAL ERTREVOR’S BED-DAY 35
TREVOR
No
Allison stands above him -- a BIC RAZOR in her gloved hand

Trevors face is covered with shaving cream

ALLISON
Sorry I thought you were going to stay
under longer

Trevor has several electrodes attached to his cranium
Theyre connected to an EEG which BEEPS LOUDLY

TREVOR
Whats happening to me What are you
doing

ALLISON

You came in for your EEG You fell asleep
in the middle and well I took the
liberty of I’m sorry You looked like
a wreck Trevor

TREVOR

I just had the most vivid dream I was
ALLISON

Well you werent You’re safe now And

as long as youre awake chin up
Allison continues shaving his neck Trevor studies her face

ALLISON
Well What do you say Trevor Que pasa

TREVOR
(groggily)
My head feels like its been sent through
a meat grinder I’m not sure if I’m
dreaming or

( )

Salmon 29

ALLISON
There’s one good thing about your
condition Everything is new and exciting
-- like you’re seeing it for the first
time Maybe you’1l see things a little
differently from now on

TREVOR
I already am

ALLISON
Well the best is yet to come

Trevor stares at Allison Something about her is different
now They’ve made a connection Allison smiles and wipes his
face clean with a towel

TREVOR
What happened to me Its like a part of
my memory has been carved out of my head

ALLISON
You just need to relax

Allison readies a Hypodermic injection for Trevor

TREVOR
No I need to remember Look whatever it
is your putting in those needles take me
off it I can handle pain What I cant
handle is not knowing

ALLISON
You need to get better first And that’s
going to take time Stop being in such a
hurry to blame yourself It was an
accident

TREVOR
Wish I could believe that
INT CUBIC ROUTETREVORS CUBICLE - DAY 36
Trevor is on his computer typing madly ON THE SCREEN WE SEE

he has accessed the local newspaper He calls up an article
reading ACCIDENT LEAVES ONE HOSPITALIZED ANOTHER MISSING

( )
Salmon 30

He looks at a newspaper picture of the bridge which is
humming with rescue activity

TREVORS HEAD IS POUNDING He pulls out a bottle of aspirin

Trevor empties the last of the bottles six tablets into his
hand downs them chases them with whats left of an economy
sized bottle of Mylanta

Bret pops in head over the cubicle

BRET
Must be nice

Bret walks around and into Trevors cubicle

TREVOR
What

BRET
Getting paid for doing shit

Trevor glances over the cubicle then turns back to Bret

TREVOR
Look I got a lot going on right now so
give me a break

BRET
That’s all I’ve been giving you but I
can’t carry your ass any longer I’m up
to my neck in my own crap as it is I
don’t need any of yours

TREVOR
You don’t understand I’ve got some
seriously weird shit going on and I can’t
even explain half of it
Bret sits Now he’s got his attention

BRET
I must say I’m intrigued

( )

Salmon

Trevor makes sure nobody in the office is listening

TREVOR
Last night I’m sitting up watching some
old videos just trying to make sense of

it all -- put a few pieces of the puzzle
together -- when there’s a knock at my
door
BRET
(sly smile)
“Dear Penthouse”I’m with ya’ Go on
TREVOR

So I answer it

BRET
Of course you do

TREVOR
And it’s Gwen

Bret freezes

TREVOR
And she is all over me I had to fight
her off

Now Bret’s eyes are bulging

BRET
GWEN

TREVOR
And not just last night Yesterday in
the break room

BRET
You are one sick motherfucker

TREVOR
What

BRET

Gwen’s dead man She killed herself a
couple of days before your accident

(acts it out)
Remember she put that plastic bag on her
head and suffocated herself Man she was
into some weird shit It’s always the
quiet ones

Trevor is speechless Bret studies him

( )
Salmon 32

BRET
You really don’t remember do you

Still nothing from Trevor We’re losing him Bret gets up
grabs his coffee cup and heads for the break room

BRET
That accident fucked you up more than I
thought

Trevor is frozen DING DING He’s got mail

He turns and finds JPEG IMAGES of the crime scene photos from
Gwen’s suicide with the header “POLICE FILE”

TREVOR
(to himself)
Jesus Christ

He tries to delete them but nothing’s working Bret’s on his
way back from the break room Shit Trevor dives to cover the
screen as Bret gets closer

BRET
You have got to chill

Trevor looks down The JPEGS are gone PHEW

TREVOR
I think I’ve lost my mind and now Im
finding pieces of it scattered on the
side of the road like the parts of a
wrecked car

BRET
Bad metaphor Bud you need to decompress
I told you that you’d came back to work
too soon

Trevor says nothing
BRET
Hey you know what Im going to hook you

up man Here

Bret disappears behind the cubicle divider We hear him
scribbling something down

His hand reappears over the divider holding a post-it with a

name and an address on it Trevor takes and notes the name
SAGE

( )
Salmon 33

BRET
She’1l take one look at you and know
exactly what you need

36A EXT SAGE’S OFFICE - DAY 36A

Trevor looks for Sage’s name on the directory He buzzes up
and she lets him in

37 INT SAGES OFFICE - DAY 37

A block of ice rests on a wooden table A large pick slams
down breaking off a chunks of ice

The ice is dropped on a tray of packaged acupuncture pins

A chart of all the puncture points on the human body is
tacked to the wall

Trevor lies on the table SAGE a gorgeous ethereal Indian
woman is at the far end hovering over the soles of his feet
sticking pins into the appropriate places She looks up at
him slyly through her red tinted glasses

SAGE
These headaches youve been getting Do
they happen in conjunction with the
hallucinations

Sage walks over to one of the cabinets gathering more
acupuncture needles Runs one across her blood red lips

Trevor cant help but notice her shapely body her feline
gait Sage throws a sultry glance over her shoulder at him

SAGE
Well

TREVOR
(unsure of himself)
Yes sort of My heads been in constant
pain since the accident And it
increases whenever I slip into another --
I dont know what you’d call them

Sage comes back to him several needles in one hand She
looks into his eyes

SAGE
Dreams

( )
Salmon 33A

TREVOR
More like nightmares But they seem so
real Like I’m awake but I’ve crossed
over into some other dimension

( )
Salmon 34

SAGE
That’s your subconscious talking Its
trying to tell you something about your
waking life

Sage begins inserting the needles fluidly to his upper body
For the first time Trevor actually feels a relief of pressure
in his head

TREVOR
OK whatever that wasdo it again You
just freed me of the world’s longest
headache

SAGE
Just relax Let the needles connect to
your soul

Trevor winces with the next needle

SAGE
Pleasure is always surrounded by pain
They’re one and the same really -- it’s

just a matter of degrees

She inserts another needle First Trevor winces in pain --
but it’s followed by a wave of pleasure that rushes over him

TREVOR
I see what you mean

There’s an unique antique LOOKING GLASS MIRROR positioned on
the floor at the head of the table

TREVOR
What’s with the mirror

SAGE
To help you look into your soul

A PHONE OUTSIDE THE OFFICE RINGS Sage looks up at the door

SAGE
Dont go anywhere Ill be right back

Trevor watches Sage EXIT the office He lies there a moment
bathing in warm sunshine He is relaxed pain free

Behind him an acupuncture anatomy chart on the wall It

begins to change its shape IT MORPHS (or economically
changes) into PINHEAD

( )
Salmon 35

Trevor is oblivious as PINHEAD approaches doll eyes
betraying no feeling whatsoever Pinhead reaches for Trevors
head and begins pulling out one of those infamous pins It
comes out quickly-

-IT THEN MORPHS INTO A FOOTLONG RAZOR SHARP PIN
Trevor hears a noise and thinks that Sage has returned

TREVOR
Im thinking this might just be what I
needed

Pinhead speaks but in Sage’s voice as he pushes the pin
towards Trevor’s back

PINHEAD
No matter what happens just remember

Before Trevor can react Pinhead suddenly jabs the pin down
into Trevors back pinning him to the table It sears his
skin In Pinheads recognizable voice

PINHEAD
Were all here for you Trevor

As Trevor reels in terror Pinhead pulls another PIN from his
head IT GROWS IN LENGTH and he thrusts this one into
Trevor’s other side

PINHEAD
So which do you find more exhilarating
The pleasure -- or the pain

The needle comes right out the other side nailing itself
into the table Trevor cant believe hes still alive

PINHEAD
(leans in close)
Personally I prefer pain Much more
truthful

Pinhead pulls one more out aims this one at Trevors neck
and swings down Trevor arches back in pain and screams as-

SAGE
Is there something wrong

Pinhead’s gone Sage is back Trevor’s eyes dart around His
breathing is quick He pulls it back together

TREVOR
No I’m I’m good

( )

Salmon 36

And that’s when Trevor’s CELL PHONE RINGS Sage grabs it out
of his jacket and hands it to him

TREVOR
Yeah

GIVENS
Trevor this is Detective Givens Lange’s
partner

TREVOR

How can I help you

GIVENS
You can talk to me

INT POLICE STATIONLANGES OFFICE - DAY 38

Same office only Trevor is sitting at the other desk across
from a hawklike MAN looking over Trevor’s file This is
Detective MITCH GIVENS If good copbad cop is the scheme
here he’s the latter

TREVOR
I dont understand How is this a
homicide case I mean nobody was
murdered Her bodys missing and

GIVENS
What did you just say

TREVOR
I said shes missing-

GIVENS
No You said HER BODYs missing

TREVOR
Whats the difference

GIVENS
Last time anybody saw this woman she was
alive You seem pretty certain shes
dead

TREVOR
(tearing up)
I saw her drowning inside the car
detective

GIVENS

I’ve done my homework on you man You’re
real smart with numbers aren’t ya’

( )
Salmon 37

TREVOR
It’s what I do for a living

GIVENS
Zeros a number right

TREVOR
As in one minus one equals zero yes
Where are you going with this

GIVENS
How many zeros was your wife worth

Trevor doesn’t follow him

TREVOR
We had nothing

GIVENS
You had nothing She had a little
inheritance stashed away for a rainy day

TREVOR
What

GIVENS
Don’t play stupid Kirsty’s father and
uncle Frank had several sizeable
financial holdings when they passed
away-
(shuffles through files)
-under some very unusual circumstances

TREVOR
She never wanted to talk about the past

GIVENS
Or maybe she just didn’t trust you Looks
like she was the sole beneficiary

Trevor’s mind races “What fucking inheritance”

( )

Salmon 38

GIVENS
But now if Kirsty’s dead -- as you seem
so fucking certain -- then I guess that
meansit all goes to you

(beat)

Looks like your working days are over
pal

TREVOR

I swear to God I didn’t know anything
about that

GIVENS
That’s all I keep hearing from you Now
my partner Detective Lange he’s a little
softer around the heart but me -- I’m as
hard as they come And when I get a
feeling about something -- I’m usually
right And I got a bad feeling about you
Trev Real bad

A stare down between the two men

TREVOR
Are we done

Givens leans in close Smiles

GIVENS
Oh nothe pain is just beginning

Trevor gets up and storms out of the office
INT POLICE STATION HALLWAY —- DAY 39

Trevor is marching down the hallway when suddenly all the
SOUND drops out from the picture SILENCE

Everything is moving slower Something catches Trevor’s eyes
in one of the offices

HIS POV of a COP sitting with his feet up on the desk He

picks up a piece of paper and in a BLINK OF THE EYE twists it
into a little ORIGAMI FIGURE He turns to Trevor with

soulless eyes -- and smiles

EXT KIRCHER’S ALLEY —- DAY 40
FLASHBACK CLOSE ON the business car “All Problems Solved”
Trevor matches the address on the card with a door at the end

of the alley There’s a faded WOODEN SIGN that creaks as it
swings above the door-

( )

41A

Salmon 39

“KIRCHER EXOTIC IMPORTSMANUFACTURING EST 1888”

Trevor walks up to the door and steps inside

INT KIRCHER IMPORTSWAREHOUSE-DAY 41
Trevor steps into what looks like an old abandoned warehouse

He finds a staircase and walks down it disappearing into the
darkness below

INT LOWER LEVEL CORRIDOR —- DAY 41A

He hears the distant HUMMING ZIPPING and PUNCHING of SEWING
MACHINES Trevor follows the sounds

He walks past several small cubicle type spaces where OLD
ASIAN WOMEN sit hunched over sewing machines sewing away

One of them looks up at Trevor and smiles without missing a
stitch then returns to her sewing

Trevor moves on past the sewing mannequins piles of cloth
etc to another cubicle There sits an enormous woman oddly
dressed in black leather and a tight mask around her face

He continues past her stepping through a LARGE PUDDLE OF
WATER that has formed below an old air conditioner

INT KIRCHER IMPORTSLOWER LEVEL OFFICE - DAY 42

One light dangles in the center of the room barely lighting
a lone wooden table

The rest is all shadows except for some burning incense and a
few scattered candles lighting three pedestals

One pedestal has HUMAN BONES scattered on it One has a plate
of DOVES HEADS on it The third and final pedestal has a TRAY
OF NEEDLES on it A disembodied voice speaks from the
shadows

VOICE
Please sit

Trevor takes a seat at the table Squints to see past the
darkness but it’s impossible

An OLD MAN appears in the doorway careful to stay in the
shadows We never get a clear look at him but from the
glimpses of features we do see we can tell that he is Asian -
- and very old

( )
Salmon 40

One thing we notice for sure is THE RING on the Old Man’s
finger Intricate exotic beautiful

The Old Man slips into some sort of “Zone” His speech is
distant -- impassive

OLD MAN
I can see into your soul You feel
desperate trapped by a wife who
suffocates you with forgiveness
TREVOR
Yes
Trevor nods his head
OLD MAN

You wish to find a way out Something
final and absolute Without remorse
Without regret

TREVOR
That’s right

OLD MAN
I have the answer you seek

TREVOR
What is it

While the Old Man speaks Trevor takes in more of the room
Erotic sometimes grotesque sculptures paintings and other
collectibles from all over the world depicting lust ecstacy
and torture surround them

( )
Salmon 41

OLD MAN
A map A Talisman that will lead your
soul down the path to freedom Freedom
from the conflict that torments your soul
-- from the conflict that brought you
here There are several of these maps in
existence One is in a vault in the
Vatican hidden in code in ancient
writings another in a monastery in the
Himalayas A third is a topiary maze in
Berlin Still a fourth in the form of an
Origami exercise

He pushes a small ORIGAMI FIGURE across the table We
recognize it as the one the COP made in the police station

OLD MAN

Wherever there is hate violence and
human depravity -- a door will always be
found

(beat)
But the fifth -- the ultimate passage --
is contained within this musical puzzle
box created by a Frenchman named
Lemarchand

He places a ROUND version of the PUZZLE BOX into the light

He pushes the puzzle box towards Trevor As it rolls across
the table the box turns and twists on itself until it morphs
into the PUZZLE BOX we all know and love

OLD MAN
The box is a means to break the surface
of the real Some are destined to master
the puzzle immediately while others will
spend a lifetime trying to solve it Once
you choose to cross the threshold you
cannot return Do you understand

Trevor reaches for it but it slides away from him

TREVOR
I do

OLD MAN
And are you willing to pay the price

Trevor slaps down a huge wad of bills The Old Man smiles
OLD MAN

Oh the price is far greater but you’ll
learn that They all do

( )

Salmon 42

Trevor grabs the box and with that a DOZEN BLACK BIRDS soar
out from behind the Old Man towards Trevor Trevor raises his
arms to defend himself and we-

SMASH CUT TO
INT POLICE STATION HALLWAY - DAY 43

Back in the hallway Trevor’s arms raised in front of him

LANGE
Trevor You OK

Trevor snaps out of it

TREVOR
Yeah I’m fine Just another headache

LANGE
Can I get you anything

Trevor shakes it off

TREVOR
No I’m I’m good

Lange backs into the office behind him and that’s when we
notice a STRANGE CONDENSATION on the window behind where

Lange was standing Like a breath

INT TREVORS APT - NIGHT 44
The TV is on Trevor flips through the channels Nothing on
Trevor turns the TV off Something makes him turn to the
window

EXT HOTEL- NIGHT 45
-HIS POV THROUGH THE WINDOW

The apartment across the street is lit The DARK FIGURE is
standing in the window

Trevor jumps up and rushes over to his window He looks OUT

and sees a woman undressing in the window She turns sees

him looking at her and abruptly pulls down the blind

INT TREVOR’S APARTMENT- NIGHT 46

A SUDDEN KNOCKING AT THE DOOR makes him flinch Trevor goes
to the door opens it to find

TAWNY Now in full on GOTH MODE

Salmon 43

TAWNY

Hey Can I borrow something
TREVOR

Uh sure what
TAWNY

She pushes him into the apartment Closes the door

TREVOR
Tawny What are you doing

TAWNY
YOU

She pushes him up against the kitchen counter Starts to kiss
him He pulls away

TAWNY
You okay

TREVOR
Feeling kind of weird actually

TAWNY
Really

Tawny grabs Trevors balls and he jumps away as if jolted by
a cattle-prod

TAWNY

Im kinda feeling nuts myself
TREVOR

Can we slow it down a bit
TAWNY

(grinning)
God Sometimes you can be such an animal
Other times you are the ultimate tease
(beat)
Its getting hot in here

Tawny walks over to the kitchen table She unzips and slips
out of her leather skirt pulls one of the chairs away from
the table and drops onto it Trevor doesn’t respond

TAWNY
Your are a little weird tonight

She unbuttons her shirt matter of factly

( )
Salmon 44

TAWNY (CONT’D)
Almost like Im with somebody else
(with a smile)
C’Mon tie me up Trevor

She pulls out some rope and cloth from her bag Rips off a
length of cloth RRRRRRRRRRRRRip Trevor is speechless She
beckons him with a finger motion

TAWNY
Come here Come on

Slowly Trevor advances toward her She stands up and
tenderly kisses him Finally he gives in and the passion
starts from there

With a swoop of her arm she clears the kitchen table She
pushes Trevor onto the table and rips open his shirt She
kisses Trevor and for the first time he kisses back Tawny
pulls away for air
TAWNY (contd)
(smiles)
That’s the Trev I know and love
The two bury their hands underneath each others clothing

Trevor spins around and sits Tawny on the table Trevors
pants drop and

The table is practically skipping across the floor Tawny and
Trevor holding on for dear life

Closes his eyes Loves it Trevor is lost

He opens his eyes When they open again he’s face to face
with a-

- A leather-clad CENOBITE

Trevor looks up to the Cenobite Before he can react a
horrific mechanism of wood and steel is strapped about his
neck and mouth

Trevor’s eyes widen He can’t breath The Cenobite begins to
turn a crank on the mechanism which tightens it over Trevors

mouth and head

The sound of bones crunching and skin tearing seem to
delight the Cenobite

His head is about to bust open

He leaps out of bed and that’s when he realizes his hands are
covered in blood And there’s a trail of blood leading into-

Salmon 45

INT TREVOR’S APARTMENTKITCHEN - MORNING 48
Trevor pokes his head out of the bedroom Doesn’t know what
he’1l find but he knows it’s not good He takes a few careful
steps into the kitchen

AND THAT’S WHEN HE SEES HER

TAWNY—

- Bound to a chair in the middle of the room with ropes and
straps and gagged with a white cloth that is soaked with

blood Her eyes are bulging and her head has been snapped to
one side

INT TREVORS APTBATHROOM - MORNING 49
Trevor splashes his face with cold water trying to get his
composure back He stares at the water rushing down the drain
for a moment

THE ONLY SOUND HE HEARS is the water whooshing His breathing
stabilizes He finally looks up at his reflection in the

mirror to find-

- PINHEAD staring back at him

PINHEAD
All problems solved

Trevor jolts backward in shock and does a double take Its
him now looking completely unhinged

INT TREVORS APARTMENT KITCHEN - DAY 50
Trevor races back into the kitchen to find that-

back into her apartment

52 INT TREVORS APT — DAY

Trevor steps back in as his answering machine picks up an

incoming call BEEP

This is Detective Lange We need to talk

interesting twist in the puzzle

The word hits Trevor like a shot

53 INT POLICE STATIONHALLWAY - DAY

Stops at the frosted glass door when he hears Lange and

Givens talking on the other side

GIVENS (OC)

The other Detectives spin to the sound and are ready to leap
on Trevor but Lange holds them off with a look

LANGE
Come on over to my desk and take a seat

Trevor takes a few deep breaths and collects himself

LANGE
Listen as long as you’re hereI do have a

Trevor your body has been completely

soul that still hurts

SAGE
Theres a puncture point on your body
that can lock your soul within it even
after youre dead So that when you die
youre trapped inside your body watching
it corrode for all eternity

TREVOR
Look whatever your Maharajah told you
forget it You’ve got to get this fucking
pain to stop

SAGE
It was an analogy Your soul is locked up
inside you You need to free it Trevor
Youve blocked yourself from the healing
process Thats what we need to do now
Heal your soul And to do that you have
to give in utterly and without any
hesitation or doubt Do you know what I
mean by giving in Its about trust Do
you trust me implicitly

TREVOR
I dont even know whats real and what
isnt anymore How can I trust anyone

SAGE
You can trust me

Sage looks at Trevor in a whole new way She gently touches
his chest

SAGE
Surrender yourself to your past Its the
only way you can become whole again

Sage looks Trevor dead in the eye

Are you willing to partake

Then BRET His throat sliced his body sprawled across the
alley

Another file comes out and it’s SAGE The ICE PICK still
jutting out of her head

Trevor’s anxiety level is rising FAST

Trevor looks over his shoulder to the Interrogation room just
as LANGE EXITS AND APPROACHES What the

Lange leads Trevor out of the Booking area

He lunges at Trevor It takes the detectives hes with and
two more cops to keep him from pummeling Trevor As Lange

LANGE
Got quite a fan club going Trevor

78D INT POLICE STATION HALLWAY - NIGHT 78D

Lange leads Trevor down another hallway Trevor looks over
his shoulder to see

INSIDE ANOTHER DOORWAY TWO DETECTIVES have some HAPLESS SOUL
strapped to an odd looking electrical contraption

HAPLESS SOUL

Salmon 76

Detectivel hits a button and a shock races through the
Hapless Souls body Detective 2 spins and notices Trevor
looking in and SLAMS the door shut
Lange opens another door and pushes Trevor through

78E INT POLICE STATION STAIRWELL - NIGHT 78E
Lange and Trevor descend down a few flights They walk past a
familiar face The UNUSUAL LOOKING MAN COVERED WITH FACIAL
PIERCINGS This time he’s in full police uniform

Not missing a step Lange and Trevor come to another door

82 INT LOWER LEVEL OF POLICE STATION - NIGHT 82

Lange drags Trevor into a long corridor It ramps down into
the bowels of the police station The walls are now different
shades of shit it doesn’t look like Kansas anymore

They keep going deeper and deeper while the corridors keep
getting stranger and more ominous

Trevor is led past a cell where a man is standing bound ina
strait jacket They make brief eye contact before Trevor
disappears through yet another door

82A INT BOWELS OF THE POLICE STATION DARK CORRIDORS - NIGHT 82A

Walking through puddles of putrid water Lange leads a very
weary Trevor to a gate Beyond the gate are corridors leading
off in many directions

Lange pulls out a set of keys from his pocket He walks
behind Trevor and unlocks his handcuffs

Lange then turns and unlocks a massive lock and pushes the
gate open Trevor marches through with purpose He turns back
to see Lange CLOSING AND LOCKING THE GATE Trevor’s locked
in

TREVOR

What are you doing Detective I thought
you believed me

Salmon 77

LANGE
Believe Here’s what I believe Trevor I
believe you and me got something in
common I believe neither of us are who
others think we are Maybe not even who
we think we are I believe each of us are
the sum of two entirely different people

TREVOR

No I know who I am I’m not a killer
LANGE

Denial to the end I Like that about you

kid
Lange leans in close
LANGE (CONTD)
Good and bad Trevor Honest and
dishonest Righteous and evil That’s how
were all made A little of both It’s
just a question of how much of each

Then Lange’s head makes a strange cracking noise He whirls
around revealing-

- GIVEN’S FACE ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD

Givens head separates from the back of Lange’s head The two
heads now face Trevor

GIVENS
And we’re made up of just the right parts
of both A little heavier on the evil

LANGE
Morgue’s right down at the end

GIVENS
You can’t miss it

Trevor stumbles back in shock then turns and races away from
the beast and down further into the corridors

INT BOWELS OF THE POLICE STATION DARK CORRIDORS - NIGHT 82B

Trevor rounds a corner to catch his breath and survey his
situation He’s being watched

The Dark Figure stands at the end of the tunnel Trevor’s not
in the mood for confrontation and heads the other way Fast

A bit further he stops and again the Dark Figure is GONE

( )

Salmon 78

Trevor keeps walking Down the corridor he sees another
strange cell with a man lying in a pool of blood DEAD

Trevor walks past not taking his attention away for the
horrific scene and stops

He find himself directly in front of the MORGUE

Slowly he pushes the door open

INT POLICE STATIONMORGUE - NIGHT 83

Trevor enters the morgue The door slams behind him

The fluorescent lights flicker overhead illuminating the
large cold space

He surveys the room

- A LONE EXAMINATION TABLE with a dead body on it covered by
a sheet A large examination light buzzes overhead

TREVOR
Kirsty

Trevor cautiously approaches the table and reaches out for
the sheet to reveal his late wife

AND THAT’S WHEN THE ROOM STARTS TO SHAKE -- HARD Like an
80

The walls begin to CRACK and chunks of plaster begin to fall

Trevor looks up to find the ceiling TEARING OPEN Blood
starts to drip from the cracks

The floor begins to crack open (Courtesy of CGI)

The light bulbs dangling in the room begin to flicker and
vibrate Several explode showering Trevor with glass

Light pours in through the exposed lattice in the walls
The walls start to shake and buckle

They tear apart opening the door to hell revealing a wall of
light

And through that wall of light-

- PINHEAD EMERGES

PINHEAD
You’ve reached the end of the line
Trevor I told you you couldn’t run from
your past forever Eventually it catches
up to us all and we must atone-
(reaches out to him)
- and now it’s time for you to pay the

price
(beat)
You were willing to pay the price weren’t

TREVOR
I just want to see my wife please

Pinhead takes great pleasure in Trevor’s suffering
PINHEAD
Jealousy arouses a spouses fury
And no mercy will be shown when that
revenge is given

FLASH BACK

INT CENOBITE HOTEL ROOM —- NIGHT 86

KIRSTY
Where did you get this

Kirsty sits on the bed staring hollowly at the PUZZLE BOX
Trevor’s holding the VIDEO CAMERA on her

TREVOR
Just open it

Kirsty has her moment of utter dread Reunited with the box

KIRSTY
What have you done--

TREVOR
It’s just a little something I thought
youd

KIRSTY

What have you done

TREVOR
Come on wait til you see what it can do

KIRSTY
Oh I know what it can do Why did you
give this to me

TREVOR
What are you talking about Kirsty
It’s just a puzzle That’s all

KIRSTY
But that’s not why you gave it to me is
it IS IT

TREVOR
Of course it is

KIRSTY
Trevor you said you loved

( )
Salmon

TREVOR
Just open the box There’s nothing to be
afraid of

KIRSTY
Then you open it

TREVOR
It’s for you you open it

KIRSTY
I TRUSTED YOU GODDAMMIT I TRUSTED YOU
WITH MY LIFE HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO
ME AFTER EVERYTHING WE’VE BEEN THROUGH

TREVOR
Kirsty-- calm down I can explain all
this

KIRSTY

I want you to look me in the eyes and
tell me you don’t know what’s in this
box LOOK AT ME

TREVOR

What’s in the box is for you and you
alone

Trevor meets her gaze His facade gone

KIRSTY
And I thought you loved me

TREVOR
(ice)
I guess you thought wrong
It takes a moment for it all to sink in
And that’s when Kirsty does a curious thing Without
breaking eye contact she deftly spins the box in her

Just like an old pro

KIRSTY
Is this what you want Trevor

And with one final turn--

KIRSTY
I hope it’s everything you want it to be

little celebration Unseen by you

Pinhead talks to Trevor bound by the chains Recalling his
own past

PINHEAD
Wherever there is hate violence and
depravity -- a door will always be found
TREVOR

The old man

PINHEAD
All problems solved Not that simple I’m
afraid You were an interesting study
That’s all Lust greed deception
Fertile ground but rather mundane I
used you Trevor You were bait to lure a
far more interesting creature

86B INT HOTEL ROOM CHAIN ROOM 86B
PINHEAD and the CENOBITES are in the room with Kirsty

PINHEAD
Kirsty We meet again

Salmon

KIRSTY
How did you find me

PINHEAD
I never lost you I’ve waited Watched
and waited Seen how the bud blossomed
and ripened into firm fruit But what to
do Pluck it and consume it Or watch it
fall from the bough rot and wither into
dirt

KIRSTY
HE wanted you here Not me

PINHEAD
Still playing the innocent Kirsty You
disappoint me After all these years
haven’t you realized that it’s you that
wants me here You opened a door long
ago and it will not be closed until I
get what I came for

KIRSTY
My soul

PINHEAD
Ah a little understanding at last It
is mine Kirsty I possess it utterly
More completely than your pathetic Trevor
ever could in his haphazard couplings I
touch the deep dark secret center of
your self And you know it You welcome
it

KIRSTY
NoYour wrong

PINHEAD
It was your loving husband who did the
hard work He made it easy for me
It seems your family always does

KIRSTY
That was Frank I gave him back I did
what I promised

PINHEAD
Don’t think I’m not grateful I am
Eternally grateful But there was
another bargain Wasn’t there You will
not have forgotten that I gave myself to
let you run Did you think that gift was
nobly and freely given Did you

The cenobites move forward to Kirsty

Pinhead is

Salmon PINHEAD (contd)

You always knew this day was coming Felt
it deep within you When you woke in the
dark slick with sweat terrified of
something you could not name was it
because I walked in your dreams When you
paused at an innocent street corner
suddenly unsure of your place in this
world was it because I stood unseen
beside you I will never rest until I get
what I want And what I want is you
They want you too Kirsty Your family
The brood that spawned you They’1ll all
be waiting at the gates of your hell

The uncle still lusting after what he
cannot have the sweetly sinful
stepmother and of course the father who
aches to hold his little girl again
Don’t you want to run to Daddy

KIRSTY
I’m done running

PINHEAD
The box will never let you go You solved
the puzzle you unleashed the power
There is no turning back You know the
price are you prepared to pay

KIRSTY
What if I made a deal But this time
Ill give you five souls in exchange for
mine

noticeably impressed He smiles

PINHEAD
Interesting

Its not looking

Salmon

Kirsty’s look is a little twisted She’s running on pure
vengeance now

KIRSTY
They’re already chosen

He sees an opening to have Kirsty step over to the “dark
side”

PINHEAD
You would bring them to me yourself

But killing them isn’t part of the deal for Kirsty

KIRSTY
You’ll get your five

He can clearly see the hate in her eyes and somehow knows
she’1ll do what she says He is pleased

PINHEAD
It seems I underestimated you You have
grown into quite the adversary

KIRSTY
I had a great teacher

He smiles The proud parent

PINHEAD
Then I accept But if you fail your soul
is mine and mine alone for eternity And
trust me -- to you it will feel even
longer than that

And with that the room is back to normal and we-

- LEAP BACK TO THE MOMENT just before Kirsty opened the
puzzle box Trevor has no clue what just happened Kirsty
turns back on the charm

KIRSTY

night stand as she pulls him onto the bed Kirsty mounts

Kirsty with

The lights flicker overhead reddening with each strobe

PINHEAD
They are all with me now But the total

This is the same sequence from the opening Trevor puts his
hand on Kirsty’s thigh She pulls it away

TREVOR
What’s wrong

She turns to him Her eyes are red rimmed watery She didn’t
want this to happen here but-

KIRSTY
I know about Gwen and the others

TREVOR
What are you talking about

KIRSTY
I’ve seen the fucking tapes All those
women Trev In our home In our bed

With that she pulls out the NICKEL PLATED PISTOL from her

Salmon

TREVOR

KIRSTY
I don’t want to relax How could you do
this to me I thought we were working it
out I thought things were getting
better You told me they were getting
better

TREVOR
They are

KIRSTY
Then why

TREVOR

Those were from a long time ago

KIRSTY
Denial to the end Typical Do me a favor
and cut the crap Trevor If you’re gonna
fuck every woman you meet behind my back
the least you can give me now is that
(beat)
I’m through

TREVOR
You have to believe me

KIRSTY
I’m done believing
(beat)
I trusted you

TREVOR
Really Then why didn’t you tell me about
the inheritance

KIRSTY
Is that what this is about The money my
father and his brother left me is tainted

never touch it

THE HOOKS AND CHAINS RELEASE all at once

Trevor scrambles to the examination table and pulls back the
sheet His jaw drops in disbelief

ITS TREVORS BODY It is blue and bloated The corpses
skull has a massive exit hole in it

Trevor stares at his own dead body in utter disbelief

TREVOR
I’m the fifth soul

HOLD on the corpse -- so tranquil

KIRSTYS VOICE (OC)
Yes Thats him

And now we are-
EXT BELOW BRIDGE —- DAY 90

REVERSE ANGLE on Kirsty looking down at the corpse wiping
the tears from her eyes

WIDER to reveal we’re back at the river below the bridge

Kirsty is still wet but now she has a towel and Police
jacket wrapped around her

In the background we can see Trevor and Kirsty’s car being
towed out of the river

DETECTIVE LANGE steps in and leads Kirsty away

Salmon 86

LANGE
That’s it

KIRSTY
(tears flowing)
He was so unhappy I tried to make him
happy But he just pulled the gun --

said he was gonna kill us both -- then he
shot himself Next thing I know we’re
under water -- and I I couldn’t see
anything and I lost him

LANGE

You did what you could I’m sorry
She looks over Lange’s shoulder to Trevor on the gurney
KIRSTY

It just doesn’t make any sense To think
he could be responsible for killing five

people

LANGE
Murder weapon appears to be the same And
now this it’s pretty much open and
shut

KIRSTY

I’m so sorry

LANGE
It’s not your fault

Crime scene investigators and Paramedics continue their on-
site investigation of the body

AND THAT’S WHEN WE REALIZE that the lead POLICE CORONER is-

DR AMBROSE -- from Trevor’s nightmares He checks the wound
on Trevors head pauses to look inside Trevors eyes

TREVORS POV Ambrose closing the eyelid again

AMBROSE
Checking oral cavity for blockage

Ambrose opens Trevors mouth

AMBROSE
And we have a winner

He pulls a long black dead lamprey out of Trevors mouth He
turns to the PARAMEDICS

Salmon 87

AMBROSE (cont’d)
You can take him away now We’ll finish
up at the morgue

The PARAMEDIC start to take the body back up the hill It’s
the same paramedic from the ambulance

PARAMEDIC
Jesus Christ buddy I know we all got our
personal problems -- God knows I gotta a
few demons of my own to deal with -- but

shit The gun to the head wasn’t enough
You had to fuckin’ deep six it off the
bridge too Little over kill don’t you
think

(sorry)
No pun intended That kinda’ shit could
get you sent straight to hell Well I
guess what’s done is done So maybe you
can do me a favor If you do meet the
maker tell him that thing I got into
last week with Carla De Lia -- won’t
happen again Swear to well you know
what I mean

ALLISON
Wait wait

ALLISON races up and stops them She’s the assistant CORONER

ALLISON
(to Trevor)
Sorry Had to leave you there for a
minute Trev But I’m back and I won’t
leave you again

Allison leans in close to Trevors face

ALLISON
Well What do you say Trevor Que pasa

DR AMBROSE
Allison what on earth possesses you to
converse with cadavers

ALLISON
What if there is no afterlife Do we just
stay stuck inside our bodies for eternity
watching ourselves decompose Wouldnt
you want someone to talk to you like a
normal human being one last time

Allison fixes a stray lock of hair on Trevors forehead

BACK TO Kirsty AND LANGE A COP calls down to Lange

LANGE
Looks like your ride’s here

KIRSTY
Thank you detective For everything

She turns and walks off tears flowing her back to Lange WE
MOVE WITH HER She moves to the top of the bridge and surveys
the activity below

But then her face suddenly shifts She stops crying regains
her composure and the crack of a smile begins to cross her
face

She moves to the other side of the bridge reaches into her
pocket and out comes the NICKEL PLATED PISTOL

Kirsty looks at it -- smiles -- and then drops it over the
bridge into the river below

She moves to the waiting police car
