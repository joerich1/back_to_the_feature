INT MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

Black screen

A rumbling sound It intensifies

A womans face appears suddenly in close up shocked
disoriented It is AMELIA (late 30s) She travels fast

pinned back to what could be a car seat It’s not clear

She is suddenly lifted up and around her face tumbling
as if in a dryer 360 degrees

The image slows down as she shuts her eyes Bits of dirt
and debris fly past her face There’s no sound The
effect is strangely beautiful

BOY’S VOICE (0S)
(Nearly inaudible) Mummy

Amelia tries to open her eyes she continues to spin

Her face stops tumbling and comes to an upright position
A skidding sound builds in intensity Her hand reaches
above to brace herself for the impact She turns to look

beside her Time is stretched

She sees a man staring ahead He looks terrified A light
grows brighter The skidding sound is almost deafening

Amelia instinctively looks away from him closing her
eyes The terrible sound peaks then slowly recedes

BOYS VOICE (0S)
(CONTD)
(Louder still) MUM

Amelia hears the boy’s voice for the first time She
opens her eyes as she ‘falls’ slowly back into space

Finally she ‘lands’ There is complete silence

Amelia is lying on a pillow She looks at the ceiling
dazed Her breathing is erratic

BOYS VOICE (CONT’D)
(Very loud) MUMMY

She sees her six year old son SAMUEL bedside He’s
small for his age intense A panicked look on his face

SAMUEL
I had the dream again
Amelia makes one mighty effort to get up Her fluffy
Maltese terrier BUGSY jumps off the bed with her She
scrambles to her feet stumbling on the way to her son

INT SAMUEL’S ROOM - NIGHT

POV under the bed The doona is lifted Amelia and Samuel
peer underneath The doona is dropped back into place

Black Closet doors open Amelia takes a quick look
inside Samuel checks everywhere Amelia closes it

Amelia is dark haired and wiry Pretty but nervous
looking Samuel’s little face is white with anxiety He
moves back and forth from one foot to the other

SAMUEL
Can we check under the bed

AMELIA
(Patient) What did it look like

Samuel shrugs his shoulders He can’t remember
AMELIA (CONT’D)
Remember what we said If you can’t see

it then it mustn’t be real

SAMUEL
It said it’s coming to kill us both

His comment unnerves Amelia She recovers quickly
AMELIA
(Very gentle) It’s just a silly dream
INT SAMUEL’S ROOM - NIGHT
Amelia searches through the bookshelf Samuel clings to
her waist not letting go Bugsy follows them
INT AMELIA’S BEDROOM - A SHORT WHILE LATER
Amelia sits up in bed Samuel in her lap the doona

surrounds them like a giant caterpillar Amelia gives the
book everything she’s got fighting her tiredness
AMELIA
(In the voice of the wolf) ‘Well Ill
climb down your chimney you fat little
pigs’ And he climbed down that chimney
straight into the huge black pot And
that was the end of the big-bad-wolf

She closes the book Samuel is still anxious

SAMUEL
Did they really get the wolf

AMELIA
(Reassuring) I’m sure they did

SAMUEL
I’m gonna kill the monster if it tries to
hurt you Mum

AMELIA
(Gentle) Nothing’s going to hurt me Sam

SAMUEL
I’1ll bash it to pieces when it comes

AMELTA
Time for bed now OK It’s very late

Samuel flips the pages straight back to the beginning

SAMUEL
Just one more time Then I’1l sleep

He won’t take no for an answer She gives in to another
read Samuel snuggles in close to her wide awake

AMELIA
(As bright as she can) A long time ago
just yesterday in fact there were three
little pigs and one nasty big wolf
INT AMELIA’S BEDROOM - A SHORT WHILE LATER
Little legs wrapped tightly around Amelia’s waist

Samuel’s face tucked in behind his mother’s He’s fast
asleep she’s wide awake

His mouth chewing at nothing grinding away The sound
goes right through Amelia His breath irritates her neck

His hand plays with her ear in his sleep She peels it
away puts it by his side
She unwraps his legs making sure she doesn’t wake him

Amelia inches silently away from her son her back to
him Samuel doesn’t wake up The gap between them widens

Amelia curls up on the other side of the bed her knees
to her chest alone

out from under the doona hanging over the bed It’s hard
to believe someone could sleep through this noise

is raised and comes down hard on a rusty nail

Little hands pushing down on a join in two pieces of
wood testing it for strength

- Bedroom The alarm keeps going The arm has not moved

cup the cup is tied to a wooden plank

A metal contraption being fitted onto skinny shoulders
Samuel grunts with the effort

Samuel’s serious face as he checks the apparatus
His legs running up the stairs

- Lounge room Samuel’s head pokes out of the basement
checking to see if the coast is clear It is

He pushes a key into the basement door locking it up

- Kitchen Samuel’s skinny legs standing on a chair his
top half obscured by an open cupboard door

His hand carefully placing the key back on a key rack

Samuel peers around the cupboard door watching for his
mother He closes it quick and jumps down out of sight

- Bedroom The arm is still there Alarm still blaring

A crashing sound downstairs The arm retracts quickly
like a crab in a shell Amelia pops out from under the
covers looking like shit She slaps the alarm off
listening Another crashing sound a bigger one
She leaps out of bed racing out of the room

INT LOUNGE ROOM - MORNING
Amelia reaches the bottom stairs

Sam’s catapult covers his body comes up over his head
At the top sits a plastic cup with a cricket ball in it

The lounge room is a mess swords toy soldiers and other
‘boy war paraphernalia’ everywhere The big old tube TV
has been knocked off its stand and lies on its side
Bugsy is in the midst of it barking wagging his tail
Amelia struggles with all her might to hold her temper

SAMUEL
It’s not broken It just slipped

She calmly walks to the TV her movements controlled

AMELTA
(Reasonable) I don’t want you using the
hammer and nails-

SAMUEL
Wait look at this When the monster comes
in the room-

AMELIA
Not inside the house Samuel-

SAMUEL
I push down here-

He pushes down hard a lever rises and launches the ball

AMELIA
Don’t

It smashes a perfect hole in one of the windows
Amelia stares at the hole imploding Samuel’s face
crumples with anxiety

INT SAMUEL’S ROOM - MORNING

Samuel waves his hands in the air He has his school
uniform on finished off by a sparkly magician’s hat

Bugsy is jumping up and down and barking
SAMUEL
Nothing in my hands Nothing in my hands

Amelia kneels at Sam’s feet trying to do up his laces

AMELIA
Stand still please

He does For three seconds

AMELIA (CONTD)
I don’t want you making weapons anymore

SAMUEL
You have to look at me Mum It doesn’t
work if you-
She pins him with her gaze

(Gentle) This monster thing has got to
stop Alright

Samuel waves his arms about Bugsy continues to bark

SAMUEL
Nothing in my hands

AMELTA
(Firmer) Samuel

POOF A beautiful bunch of paper flowers pops into
Samuel’s hands seemingly out of nowhere

Amelia smiles in spite of herself She takes the paper
bouquet Sam touches her cheek very gently She softens

AMELIA (CONTD)
(Closing her eyes) That feels nice

Sam hugs her she hugs him back He kisses her cheeks
grips her tighter and tighter She hides her annoyance

AMELIA (CONTD)
(Restrained) That’s enough now

Samuel won’t stop he hugs her really tight She recoils

AMELIA (CONTD)
(Snapping) Don’t do that

Sam stops in his tracks Amelia immediately looks guilty

in his 50s and Sam’s teacher a dour middle aged woman
The principal is grave the teacher looks traumatized

The principal lays down a sinister contraption made from
a belt with some wood screws and nails attached to it

Amelia’s face falls This is worse than she imagined
PRINCIPAL
This is the home made gun he demonstrated

in class today It fires off nails

AMELIA
Oh my God Did he hurt anyone

TEACHER
The nails could have gone right into a
child’s eye Or worse

Amelia studies the gun parental shame creeping over her
AMELTA

(Genuine) I’m so sorry I had no idea
I’m going to have a serious talk with him-

PRINCIPAL
Mrs Vanek we’ve had the talks we’ve had
the sessions with the counsellor Miss

Bowen can’t have the boy in her class
anymore without supervision it’s just
too dangerous (Carefully) We’re going to
have to employ a monitor for him

AMELIA
A monitor

PRINCIPAL
He’1l still be in the class but he’1l be
separated from the other children The
monitor will supervise him one on one

AMELIA
All the time

PRINCIPAL
Yes

Amelia searches both their faces becoming desperate

AMELTA
Please Samuel won’t cope with this He
already feels so different

PRINCIPAL
I understand your concern but this is
the only way we can keep him in school

AMELIA
(Desperate) I’1l have a talk to him-
PRINCIPAL AMELIA
Mrs Vanek I’1l have a serious talk
and I know he’1l settle
down
PRINCIPAL

The boy has significant behavioural
problems (Beat) Miss Bowen and myself
realize you’ve had a rough trot so we’ve
tried to be as lenient as we can
Amelia’s vulnerable demeanour shifts her face tenses

AMELTA
Sorry

Uncomfortable moment He treads very carefully

PRINCIPAL
Sometimes boys can be very hard to
handle when there’s no father around

AMELIA
Oh I see I’m a single mother so I can’t
look after my child is that right

PRINCIPAL
No no that’s not what I meant-

AMELIA
Samuel doesn’t need a full time monitor
he needs some understanding

TEACHER
Are you saying I’m not understanding

AMELIA
(Frustrated) I’m just saying he needs
more care at the moment that’s all

TEACHER
I have 24 other lst graders in that
class Would you like me to put them all
at risk for your son

PRINCIPAL TEACHER (CONT’D)
Please let’s just keep I’m not a psychologist
calm here-

Amelia stands defensive

AMELIA
You know what I think it’s best I just
look for another school

PRINCIPAL
(Exasperated) Mrs Vanek you can’t just
take the boy out of school We’1ll have to
inform Community Services

AMELTA
You do what you need to do and I’1l find
a school that sees my son as a human
being not a problem to be gotten rid of

PRINCIPAL
That’s very unfair We’re only trying to
help the boy

AMELIA
Please stop calling him ‘the boy’ His
name is Samuel

Amelia crouches down She chooses her words carefully
AMELTA
(Very gentle) We’re going to have a break

black top hat perched on top It looks funny

AMELIA (CONTD)
‘Tf youre a really clever one and you
know what it is to see
Then you can make friends with a special
one a friend of you and me’

Amelia pulls a lever a black gloved hand pops out from
behind the door waving hello Samuel’s face lights up

AMELIA (CONTD)
‘His name is Mister Babadook
And this is his book’

The book is beautifully done but somehow creepy

AMELIA (CONTD)
We might read another one tonight hey

SAMUEL
(Turns the page) You said I could choose

A little boy next to a big wardrobe his hand to his ear
The words ‘RUMBLE RUMBLE RUMBLE’ are written around him

(Wary) This is what he wears on top Hes
funny dont you think

Creepy more like it Amelia turns the page very wary

AMELIA (CONTD)
‘See him in your room at night (reads to
herself) and you wont sleep a wink’

Mister Babadook falls from the ceiling towards the boy
The speech bubble reads ‘LET ME IN The boy screams The
image is very disturbing Samuel is instantly frightened

Amelia hides the book from Sam skimming it for herself
concerned He struggles with her trying to see it

SAMUEL
Does it hurt the boy Mum

A black silhouette of the Babadook raising its arms like
big insect wings It looks freaky

SAMUEL (CONTD)
(Getting scared) Where does it live

‘Ill soon take off my funny disguise (Take heed of what
youve read)
SAMUEL (0S) (CONTD)
(Anxiety rising to fever pitch) Does it
live under the bed Mum

‘And once you see whats underneath

‘YOURE GOING TO WISH YOU WERE DEAD’

She shuts the book quickly as Samuel’s cries escalate

INT SAMUEL’S ROOM - NIGHT 28

Amelia patiently reads another story to Samuel who has
his arms wrapped around her waist howling with fear

- A while later

Amelia lies on her side staring blankly at the large
teak wardrobe opposite Sam’s bed The doors are shut
Moonlight plays across it making it look almost alive
Samuel is finally asleep He scrunches her ear in his
sleep She lets him do it too exhausted to resist

INT AMELIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 29

Amelia opens the Babadook book The Babadook drops from
the ceiling the speech bubble ‘LET ME IN’ pops up

She flips the page The silhouette of the Babadook
raising its ‘wings’ ‘And once you see whats underneath’

She turns the page ‘YOURE GOING TO WISH YOU WERE DEAD’
She hurriedly turns to the next page It’s blank

Then the page after and the one after that all blank
She searches for publishing markings There aren’t any

- Later Amelia stands on a stool reaching up to top of
her wardrobe book in hand She shoves the book back as
far as it will go out of the reach of little hands

INT LOUNGE ROOM - LATE NIGHT 30

The TV flickers lighting up a dreary room Amelia stares
at it comatose The rest of the house is in darkness

Bugsy is curled up in Amelia’s lap There’s a large empty
chip packet beside her She’s now onto the chocolate

On the TV a sexy young girl in a low cut dress nibbles
some chocolate A handsome muscly young guy watches her

Amelia nibbles her chocolate vagued out She flicks the
channel

An ad for phone porn young girls with their private
parts covered by ‘stars’

She changes it quickly this time resting on a love scene
from an old black and white Hollywood movie

Amelia opens and closes her jaw massaging the hinge
joint a longing in her eyes as the lovers kiss She
turns it off plunging the room into eerie darkness

INT HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT 31

The old house is completely dark The stairs creak as
Amelia climbs them

She closes the door on Bugsy He hangs around outside

INT AMELIA’S BEDROOMSAMUEL’S ROOM - LATE NIGHT 32

- Amelia’s room A sewing basket in Amelia’s hands She
takes off a top layer of fabric then a layer of thread
Finally she pulls out a vibrator hiding underneath

She takes a look at the door then jumps into bed The
room is dark just a sliver of light through the windows

Amelia reaches under the doona wriggling around She
throws her undies on the floor determination on her
face A hum begins she closes her eyes

- Samuel’s room He’s having a nightmare breathing fast
His eyes open suddenly He peeks out over the doona

The doors of the wardrobe opposite are wide open a
yawning blackness inside

Samuel cranes his neck to peer in terrified He throws
himself back under the covers disappearing completely

- Amelia’s room Amelia’s flushed face pops out from
under the covers trying to bring on arousal almost
forcing it The room seems alive shadows threaten

- Samuel’s room Samuel’s pulls a slingshot and some
metal pellets from under his mattress He sits up loads
the weapon then aims it at the wardrobe not breathing

- Amelia’s room Amelia is about to orgasm a pained look
on her face She holds off for as long as she can

Her door creaks opens but she doesn’t see A creepy
shadow drops to the floor and disappears Her breathing
is very deep she’s almost there

The shadow jumps up on the bed Amelia yells in fright

It’s Samuel Amelia turns off the vibrator flings it
under the bed Bugsy runs and jumps on the bed too

AMELTA

AMELIA
What

SAMUEL

The Babadook
Amelia registers what’s happening shaking her head

AMELIA
Oh no no no This is not going to happen

SAMUEL
The closet doors were closed and now
they’re wide open

Amelia calms herself down fighting her agitation

AMELTA
Sam a book is a book It can’t hurt you

Samuel looks sheepish

AMELIA (CONTD)
Youve had a huge day you’re exhausted

She grabs the doona and throws it over the both of them
hugging Samuel to her stiffly She pats him on the back
Initially he struggles but slowly slowly calms down

Finally silence He rolls over to look at his mum

SAMUEL
(Loving) I don’t want anything bad to
happen to you Mum

AMELIA
Nothing bad’s going to happen to me Sam

SAMUEL
I’m gonna protect you

He touches her face She closes her eyes submerging her
resentment bringing herself back down to earth

INT SHOTS OF HOUSE INTERIOR - DEAD OF NIGHT 33
The kitchen is dark and empty Mess everywhere
The lounge room is empty too it feels spooky

Not a soul in the hall The old house is entirely still

INT AMELIA’S BEDROOM - DEAD OF NIGHTMORNING 34

Amelia sits up in bed unable to sleep She’s reading
‘The Artist’s Way’ her eyes hanging out of her head
Samuel is curled up beside her fast asleep

She hears a distant sound like someone running around
downstairs The noise concerns her She listens for more

Dead silence Eventually she returns to her book

Another sound downstairs a bit louder this time Amelia
waits to hear more Troubled

Nothing

She shuts her book and pulls the doona over her head
over Samuel’s too a little unnerved

Amelia studies her son’s sleeping face under the covers
trying to gain some comfort from it

The image of her face ‘speeds up’ as she drifts off to
sleep it twitches and moves in fast motion as she sleeps
her way through the fastest night ever She opens her
eyes still under the doona

SAMUEL
Mum It’s nine o’clock

She hurls the covers off to find the alarm blaring away
She looks at the time It is indeed 9 am

She reaches for her mobile phone on silent There are

five missed calls She checks the last one The word
‘work’ flashes up on the screen She springs out of bed

EXT OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - MORNING

Amelia juggles her bag her keys Samuel’s things and
talks on the mobile all at once

AMELIA (CONTD)
(Covering the phone) Put it back

Samuel kicks up a fuss

AMELIA (CONTD)
Put it back or it’s going in the bin

Samuel’s shoulders slump he takes it back inside
AMELIA (CONTD)
(Back to the phone) I’m sorry I couldnt
get to the phone he was throwing up

She hangs up
AMELIA (CONTD)

runs after him and grabs him

AMELIA (CONTD)
The next number is 5 billion Anyone got

SAMUEL
You got them for me on the Internet

AMELIA
Well that’s the end of the Internet

Samuel sighs Amelia tries a much gentler approach

No answer

AMELIA (CONTD)
(Reasoning) If you keep talking to things

you to come over anymore (Beat) Samuel

Just stubborn silence

Bugsy is spooked and hightails it up the stairs

SAMUEL (CONT’D)

He runs to the stairs and pulls on a rope It tightens
across the stairs like a trip wire

- Kitchen Amelia sees Bugsy push open the basement door
and run through it She’s shocked to see that door open

SAMUEL
I was just putting something back

She walks to it Samuel has left the light on down there

After a time she forces herself down those stairs

INT BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

Amelia finds the crowded space in chaos Samuel has

pulled out all his father’s things a desperate attempt
to connect The sight of it all puts Amelia into a spin
She races around randomly stuffing things back in boxes

She clocks the photo of her and Oskar walks over picks
it up puts it in her pocket unable to even look at it

She turns and what she sees makes her jump with fright

Samuel has fixed a hat shirt and trousers to the wall
using his father’s things to replicate a person A pair
of shoes rest under each trouser leg Oskar’s violin is
out of its case propped up against the wall as if the
shirt arm were holding it

Amelia’s fright subsides overtaken by a terrible remorse
that hits her right in the guts Tears well in her eyes

INT SAMUEL’S ROOM - AFTERNOON 46

piano It’s good definitely music not just noise

She enters the room he stops playing immediately

sigh of relief

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT 47

something It hurts She takes it out of her mouth It’s

a shard of glass Her tongue bleeds slightly

AMELIA
Don’t eat it

Samuel stops She sifts through her soup Another shard

She tests his soup No glass She looks through hers and
sees more pieces Samuel looks panicked

AMELIA (CONTD)
Did you put glass in my soup

SAMUEL

He gets up Amelia searches his face for the truth

SAMUEL (CONTD)
The Babadook did it

AMELTA

AMELIA (CONTD)
(Firm) Just go watch a DVD Samuel

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

- Stairs Amelia trudges up the stairs She sees the back
of Samuel running into his room He shuts the door behind
him Odd

- Amelia’s room Amelia catches sight of something shoved
under her wardrobe She bends down to have a look

It’s a hammer There’s a broken glass next to it shards
of glass on the carpet Her throat tightens

She stands up notices the bed All the covers have been
pulled off and are lying on the floor Amelia moves in
spotting a photo in the centre of the mattress

It’s the one of her and Oskar Oskar’s face has been
scratched out with a pen Her eyes have been drawn over
with black holes the mouth drawn into a silent scream
She strongly resembles the pictures of the Babadook

- Sams room Amelia storms in She holds up the photo
close to Samuel’s face shaking with rage and fear

AMELIA
Do you think this is FUNNY

Samuel’s face drops He runs straight for his catapult

Amelia intercepts trying to grab it from him He
wrenches it back off her a genuine struggle

She bends down to reason with him He takes the chance to
slap her hard across the face then shoves her so
forcefully she falls on her back

SAMUEL
(Violent) DO YOU WANT TO DIE

Amelia is speechless She watches Sam load the catapult
For the first time she’s genuinely scared of her son
INT KITCHENSAMUEL’S ROOM (INTERCUT) - NIGHT

- Kitchen Bugsy jumps up trying to reach Amelia’s lap
She ignores him scratching her head staring into space

The lights dip in and out It makes her anxious

Suddenly that pain in her mouth again She feels the
offending molar wincing as she pulls and tugs at it

- Sam’s room He sleeps sitting up with his catapult on
breathing too fast and shallow dwarfed by his armour

- Kitchen Amelia scratches her scalp with her fingers
as if to relieve the pressure in her head and jaw Bugsy
tries to comfort her but she’s in another world

- Sam’s room He wakes suddenly Shadows in every corner
It doesn’t feel safe He looks at the wardrobe opposite

The doors are open

Sam slips off the bed Mustering all his courage he
takes small steps towards the wardrobe

- Kitchen Amelia’s fingers scrape against her scalp The
sound intensifies the image so close it becomes surreal

Her face her eyes in close up full of anxiety The
sound of her scratching becomes deafening

- Samuel’s eyes and face framed by the catapult

The dark closet yawns open a deep terrifying hole

He lifts his eyes and face slowly following something we
don’t see up the wall and across the ceiling

- Amelia hears a terrible crashing sound upstairs Then
Samuel screaming as if he’s being murdered She leaps to
her feet and is up those stairs in an instant

INT SAMUEL’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 51

Amelia finds the wardrobe too heavy for Sam to pull
over lying face down on the floor His clothes spill out
underneath it The room looks like it’s been ransacked

Amelia can’t see Samuel She runs to the open window
then to the bed in a panic searches underneath

Samuel is squashed right into a corner He still has his
catapult on He won’t come out clinging to the bed post
She has to really take hold and drag him out

She’s never seen anything like it His body is rigid in
her arms his face a picture of terror It frightens her

SAMUEL
(Over and over) Don’t let it in Don’t
let it in Don’t let it in

He starts to hyperventilate Amelia carries him to the
bed and covers him with her body trying to calm him

Her eyes scan his pillows Underneath one of them lies a
book She can see the spine of it

‘MISTER BABADOOK’

Her blood runs cold

INT STAIRWELL - NIGHT 52

- Amelia takes the ‘MISTER BABADOOK to the table
opening it becoming more agitated as she reads

‘If it’s in a word or it’s in a look you can’t get rid
of the Babadook’ She turns the page

The image of the Babadook falling on the boy in bed The
speech bubble ‘let me in’ from the creature’s mouth

She slams the book shut tries to rip it in half It’s
too thick Determined she rips out a page at a time
tearing each one to pieces

- Amelia shoves the remnants in the Otto bin shuts it

- Amelia carries the sleeping Samuel into her room

INT AMELIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHTDAY 56

Amelia watches Samuel as he sleeps Bugsy is asleep in
her arms his front legs poking up near her face

The power surges the lamp light flickers

That sound again downstairs Amelia’s face tightens She
listens for more holding her breath

Nothing Just tight and tense silence

Amelia moves in to Samuel squashing Bugsy in between
She pulls the doona over her head It covers the screen

SAMUEL (0S)
Mum do we have to go to Ruby’s party

The doona is dragged down to reveal Amelia’s exhausted
face It’s suddenly morning She stares at the ceiling
then makes a monumental effort to turn on her side

Her hand comes out from under the doona reaches to the
floor She picks up a present amongst the clothes and
books scattered there The paper has angels all over it

INT CLAIRE’S KITCHEN - DAY 57
The present is passed to Ruby who’s waiting expectantly
Amelia looks like she hasn’t slept in years dark circles
under her eyes Sam sits on her lap fragile withdrawn

His arms around her neck She suffers it in silence

The middle class mothers surround her all perfect hair
and white teeth Beyond groomed Kids running everywhere

Ruby opens the present and is obviously disappointed

RUBY
I’ve already got this Barbie

CLAIRE
Well now she has a twin They can go
shopping together

Ruby flounces outside The other kids follow her Except
for Samuel who stays exactly where he is

AMELTA
Go on off you go

Amelia’s aware she’s being watched by the mothers Samuel
won’t let go of her neck burying his face in her chest

AMELIA (CONTD)
(Laughing nervously) He’s just tired

She peels his arms away Samuel frets starting to cry
The mothers give each other surreptitious looks

Amelia pulls Samuel to her by both wrists

AMELIA (CONTD)
(Measured) Go-and-play-right-now

Sam leaves half crying half whining looking at his mum
all the way She tries to pretend nothing’s happening

MOTHER 3 gives Claire a look Claire rolls her eyes then
looks to Amelia who is staring right at her Claire looks
away caught out Amelia is hurt and humiliated

Uncomfortable silence

MOTHER 1
Claire tells me you’re a writer

AMELTA
(Nervous) Oh Not so much anymore

MOTHER 2
What kind of writing do you do

AMELTA
(Awkward) I wrote articles for magazines
Some kids stuff but that was really
just I’ve written a novel

MOTHER 3

AMELTA
(Embarrassed) It hasn’t been published

MOTHER 1
Oh Never mind

An awkward pause Amelia’s face flushes with humiliation

CLAIRE
She’s very talented she just needs to
get back into it that’s all

Amelia becomes very uncomfortable the focus on her

MOTHER 1
It must be very difficult I do volunteer
work with some disadvantaged women A few
of them have lost their husbands and they
find it very hard

Amelia looks at Mother 1 her face darkens
CLAIRE
(Changing the subject) How’s Richards

Tight on Amelia fighting a growing anger

MOTHER 1 (CONT’D)

AMELTA
(Blurting it out) That’s a real tragedy

The mothers all look at Amelia taken aback She stares
at Mother 1 her contempt obvious
AMELIA (CONTD)
Not having time to go to the gym How do
you cope
Pause
AMELIA (CONTD)
You must have a lot to talk about with
those poor disadvantaged women

Horrible silence Claire gives her sister a death stare

Amelia looks away defiant refusing to meet her gaze

AMELIA
That’s not true

CLAIRE
I know he was the love of your life And
it is God awful what happened to him But
it’1ll be seven years Amelia isn’t it
time you moved on

Amelia struggles desperately to keep her feelings in

AMELIA
I have moved on I don’t mention him I
don’t talk about him What strain is it
on you Claire I listen I listen to
your life day in day out and you don’t
stop to ask me anything about mine

- Backyard

AMELIA
You don’t come round to our house

CLAIRE AMELTA

CLAIRE
(Snapping) Because I can’t stand being
around your son

AMELIA
I can’t believe you just said that

CLAIRE
You can’t stand being round him yourself

cousin hard

Ruby is knocked off balance She grabs at the air as she
falls backwards right out the door

Samuel face drops as he watches her fall
- Backyard Claire sees her daughter fall turn mid air
and land straight on her face on the ground below It

looks awful Both sisters rush over

Ruby stands up in shock blood pouring from her mouth
Slowly surely she starts to howl

All the kids stop playing and stare Some get scared

CLAIRE (CONT’D)
Let me have a look darling

She opens her mouth A tooth has snapped off at the base
Ruby is hysterical Blood spurts out

Amelia sees her son at the top of the tree house He
looks scared and guilty as he climbs down

CLAIRE (CONTD)
(Lashing out at him) WHAT DID YOU DO

SAMUEL
(Very upset to Amelia) She said I didn’t
have a dad She kept saying it

RUBY
(Through the sobs) He He said the
Babadook was going to kill you Mummy

She howls Claire picks her up and moves swiftly into the
house Amelia follows shame and anxiety on her face

CLAIRE
(To Amelia) That bottom tooth is an adult
tooth She’s not going to get it back

Ruby squeals Claire holds her tight and marches to the
front door Amelia follows her closely

CLAIRE (CONT’D)
Stay here and look after the children Do
you want another one to get hurt

Claire’s voice upsets one of the girls the girl cries
this sets another one off The kids are scared

She charges out of the door with her squealing daughter
Amelia turns to see a group of children in various states
of distress And in the middle is Samuel completely
lost He rushes in to Amelia She pushes him away He
runs to her again

AMELTA
GET AWAY FROM ME

Samuel stops in his tracks shocked and scared

Amelia looks at the crying children in front of her Her
stress reaching boiling point

INT CAR - DAY

Amelia drives fast stuffing her emotions down

A large cockroach appears on her bare leg She violently
sweeps it away It goes flying into the mess at her feet

SAMUEL
(Crying) Mum I didn’t mean to hurt her
She wouldn’t believe me Mum-meee

He starts kicking the back of her seat to get her
attention Kicking over and over and over

Amelia swerves to the side of the road screeches to a
halt She flips her seat belt off turns around

AMELIA
There is no BABADOOK

Samuel’s anguish rising to fever pitch He screams and
cries kicking the seat over and over

AMELIA (CONTD)
IT’S ALL MADE UP IN YOUR HEAD

Samuel suddenly goes quiet He looks to his right seeing
something Amelia can’t see He looks horrified

SAMUEL
(To the air) Get out (To Amelia) Mummy

AMELIA
(Frightened) Samuel stop it now

SAMUEL
(To the air terrified) GET-OUT

He goes red in the face as if he’s choking Amelia
watches immobilized by shock

A middle aged couple stop and stare concerned

Samuel kicks and punches thrashing his body around He
screams out in pain Amelia desperately tries to help

Samuel’s eyes roll back in his head his body goes rigid
his fingers splayed It looks absolutely horrifying

Amelia panics She opens her car door
AMELTA
(To the onlookers) Please help There’s
something wrong with my child

INT DOCTOR’S SURGERY - DAY

An eye is checked by a sharp light The pupil contracts

A tongue depressor is put into the child’s mouth
A stethoscope against Samuel’s bare chest

DOCTOR (0S)
Cough now

Samuel’s throat showing the reflex of a cough

Samuel looks to the doctor an overworked middle-aged
man Amelia sits on a chair nearby She looks wrecked

INT DOCTOR’S RECEPTIONDOCTOR’S SURGERY - DAY 61

- Samuel waits on the bench exhausted The receptionist
gives him a warm smile He doesn’t smile back

- Surgery

DOCTOR
Id say it was a febrile convulsion The
brain gets overheated-

AMELIA
Yes I know what they are I’m a nurse

DOCTOR
It always looks worse than it is

AMELTA
I’ve never seen anything like that

DOCTOR
He’s obviously suffering from a high
level of anxiety very committed to the
monster theory

AMELIA
That’s an understatement

The doctor stops to look at Amelia slightly irritated

DOCTOR
All children see monsters

AMELIA
Not like this And it’s getting worse

DOCTOR
He could see a psychiatrist I have some
numbers Takes a few weeks to get in

AMELIA
Of course he needs to see someone But
can I just get something now to make him
sleep Just until I get an appointment

The doctor hesitates

AMELIA (CONTD)
Please I haven’t slept in weeks Neither
has Samuel When we go home tonight the
whole nightmare will start up again and
I’m-not-coping

He seriously studies Amelia sizing her up

DOCTOR
I can prescribe a short course of
Benzodiazepine just till the tests come
back These are very strong for children
Most mothers aren’t too keen on them
unless it’s really bad

AMELTA
It’s really bad

He opens his pad and writes out the script
DOCTOR
They can make children feel
uncoordinated foggy maybe some
temporary nausea They’1ll help him to
sleep though that’s for sure

He rips out the prescription and hands it to her

DOCTOR (CONT’D)
That’s for one week Half strength

Amelia’s face relaxes a little Problem solved for now

INT SAMUEL’S ROOM - NIGHT

Amelia has a glass of water and the pills at hand Samuel
sits up worried looking at the pills

SAMUEL
Is there something wrong with me

AMELIA
I’m sure everything will be alright
These will help for now

SAMUEL
Why don’t people like me

AMELIA
Why do you say that

SAMUEL
Ruby said people don’t like me coz I’m
weird

AMELIA
Sometimes people say things that aren’t
true

Samuel doesn’t look convinced

AMELIA (CONTD)
You just need to take your medicine have
a big sleep and not worry

Samuel is suddenly very anxious He clings to Amelia She
tries not to tense up at his touch

SAMUEL

I don’t want you to die
AMELIA

I’m not going to die for a long time yet
SAMUEL

Did you think that about my dad before he

died
The comment hits her She slowly pulls him away from her

AMELTA
You need to take these pills so you can
go to sleep (Bright) I’ve got the day
off tomorrow Maybe we can do something

SAMUEL
Will these make the Babadook go away

AMELIA
I think so But you have to promise you
won’t mention it again

He takes the pills in hand looks at her seriously
SAMUEL
I promise to protect you if you promise

to protect me Then I won’t mention it

AMELIA
Of course I will

SAMUEL
Sometimes people say things that aren’t
true

She looks him in the eyes as sincerely as she can
AMELTA
I promise to protect you (About the

pills) Come on

He takes them she gives him the water he drinks it

SAMUEL

(Anxious) Can you stay here with me
AMELTA

Yes
SAMUEL

I love you Mum

AMELTA
(Tight) Me too

Samuel’s face drops with her response Amelia tucks him
into bed He doesn’t look at her infinitely sad

Amelia stands and looks at Samuel’s back a guilty

sadness crosses her face

INT AMELIA’S ROOM - NIGHTMORNING 63
Amelia sits on her bed heavy with exhaustion

Her face seen from above as she falls onto the pillow in
slow motion The pillow seems miles away A lullaby plays

on violin Her face relaxes her eyes close

Finally she lands on the pillow surrendering to deep
sleep A soft unearthly light plays on her face

After several blissful moments the lullaby ends Amelia
opens her eyes and looks over at the clock llam

She drifts up to sitting It’s quiet and calm in the room
and outside She stands her face is tranquil dreamy

INT SAMUEL’S ROOM - MORNING 64
Amelia sees Samuel lying on his bed with his back to her

completely still She drifts towards him His eyes are
closed his face perfect like a doll’s

She leans in to check he’s breathing He is

INT HALLWAY - MORNING 65
Amelia shuffles down the hallway yawning content
Three knocks on the front door

She covers over her dressing gown smooths down her hair
and moves to the door opening it

There’s no one there She peers out onto the street Not
a soul It’s very quiet strangely so She stands there a
moment puzzled then closes the door

Amelia’s almost at the end of the hall when it happens
again Three loud sharp knocks

She turns strides to the front door opens it

Sitting on the welcome mat is the book of ‘MISTER
BABADOOK’ Its pieces all glued back together

The blood drains from Amelia’s face She bends down to
pick it up She looks on the street for any sign of life

Nothing

Amelia runs inside with the book firmly in her grasp

INT LOUNGE ROOM - MORNING 66

Amelia flips through the book becoming more frightened
as she goes She finds a new page with large angry words

‘Ill WAGER with YOU ILL MAKE you a BET THE MORE you
DENY the STRONGER I GET’

She flips the page

The boy in the bed has been replaced by a screaming
woman She looks like Amelia The Babadook drops down
over her the words ‘LET ME IN’ flying out of its mouth

Amelia flips the page The woman stands with arms
outstretched The Babadook’s shadow rises behind her

‘You start to CHANGE when I get in the BABADOOK growing
right UNDER YOUR SKIN

Amelia’s hands shake as she fumbles for the next page

OH COME COME SEE WHATS UNDER-NEATH

She turns the page

A huge shadow envelops the woman as she snaps the neck of
a little white dog The dog looks exactly like Bugsy

Amelia flips the page not wanting but needing to see

The woman strangles a boy with her bare hands The shadow
holds her arms forcing her to it Amelia flips the page

An image of the woman her mouth open in a terrible
scream She slits her throat blood spurts everywhere

Amelia turns to the final page Just text that says

‘IF IT’S IN A WORD OR ITS IN A LOOK YOU CANT GET RID
OF THE BABADOOK

EXT BACKYARD - MORNING

Petrol splashes out of a can

A pair of hands throw a lit match into the barbeque where
the ripped up book now lies It ignites quickly

Amelia stands back as the flames rise watching it burn
She sees Samuel at the back door trying to wake up She
shoots him a tense smile He looks concerned

Amelia puts down the phone crushed She stares at her
hands black from the smoke Silence

The phone rings sharply giving her a fright

AMELIA
(Picking up) Claire

There is a silence on the other end

AMELIA (CONTD)
(Growing tense) Hello

Finally a noise on the other end but not a human one
‘Babababababa dook-dook-dook

The sound rips through Amelia She slams down the phone

ask you to look after him-

MRS ROCHE AMELTA
(Genuine) That’s no problem Claire’s busy I normally
at all- wouldn’t ask for help

Mrs Roach reaches out taking Amelia’s hand

MRS ROACH
It’s not a crime to ask for help love

Amelia tries with all her might not to cry

INT POLICE STATION - DAY
Amelia enters intimidated by the surroundings

There are three policemen on duty one older sergeant at
the front desk and two in the back who don’t look old
enough to be working They all look bored

Amelia shuffles up to the counter

AMELTA
Hi I want to report someone stalking me
and my child

SERGEANT
(Starts writing) When did the incident
occur Madam

AMELIA
It started this week

SERGEANT
Can you tell us what happened

AMELIA
Someone sent me a a children’s book

The teenage cops stifle a laugh Amelia sees it The
Sergeant gives them a quick stern look

SERGEANT
And

AMELIA
(Directed at the two in the back) And it
contained violent and graphic images of
my child and me being murdered

The two in the back instantly stop smiling

SERGEANT
Can we have a look at the book please
AMELTA
(Sheepish) I burnt it
SERGEANT
(Deflated) You burnt it
AMELTA
Yes
SERGEANT

Well unfortunately there’s nothing we
can do about it

AMELTA
He’s making phone calls to me as well

SERGEANT
What’s he saying

AMELIA
Nothing he’s just making noises

SERGEANT
How do you know it’s the same person

AMELIA
Because of what he wrote in the book

SERGEANT
The book you burnt

AMELTA
(Defeated) Yes

She looks past the policemen in the back and sees a coat
rack On the rack hangs a long black coat Perched right
on top of the coat is an old fashioned black top hat

Just like the coat and hat in the book
Amelia looks suddenly frightened The Sergeant notes it
He looks at her hands on the counter black from the

fire Amelia retracts them trying to remain composed

She straightens her hair the hair she didn’t brush this
morning The Sergeant doesn’t take his eyes from her

SERGEANT
Are you having a hard time at the moment
love

She looks to the hat and coat then back to the Sergeant
trying to concentrate

AMELIA
OK thanks don’t worry about it

She almost runs out

Samuel- It might get worse but it
wont get better-

AMELTA

INT LOUNGE ROOMKITCHENHALLWAY - DAY

asleep Her tooth is giving her a massive migraine

- Bugsy is in the kitchen barking nonstop She tries to
move closer to him he runs straight past her outside

It looks like a bomb’s gone off Food in the sink mess
everywhere She pauses for a moment overwhelmed

Something tickles her arm It’s a cockroach She jumps
flicking it off in disgust It falls to the floor

She notices another one on the floor nearby Then
another About six or seven of the bastards They seem to
be coming from behind the fridge

Amelia pulls the fridge out from the wall The wallpaper
is torn in one place A cockroach pops out of it It
disgusts her She starts to peel back the paper

A hole in the wall It’s filled with cockroaches They
crawl out some dropping at her feet She has to stop
from vomiting as she runs for a broom

Samuel appears at the door

AMELIA
Don’t come in here

- Later The contents of the fridge have been turfed out
onto the benches It looks even messier than before

Amelia has an old dress on and large rubber gloves She
looks completely dishevelled manically cleaning

A pause The three knocks come again

She creeps past a sleeping Samuel on the couch towards
the front door her broom as a weapon

END

Samuel is asleep Amelia stares at the end of her bed
the light of the lamp bleeding into the darkness beyond

The lights flicker The bedside light buzzes softly then
gets louder Amelia flicks her arm out and turns it off

INT AMELIA’S BEDROOM - LATER 77

Amelia lies wide awake in bed on her side Samuel is out
to it She turns over restless staring at the ceiling

That sound downstairs again Only this time it comes up
the stairs and stops outside her door Amelia freezes

A slight scratching sound at the door She starts to
panic the scratching gets louder

She hears a whimpering It’s the dog
She springs out of bed and opens the door relieved

Bugsy runs in jumps straight up on the bed finds a spot
near Samuel and settles Amelia jumps under the covers

Silence Darkness Amelia’s eyes flicking nervous

The scratching starts up again only this time it can’t
be the dog Amelia stares at the door unable to move

The door clicks and moves open by itself Amelia watches
her heart in her throat The rustling scratching sound
moves inside the room Amelia slips the covers over her
head terrified She can’t see anything now

The sound appears to be moving closer

After an age Amelia pulls down the duvet unable to
stand it anymore She peers into the terrible darkness

Something large and black lurks in one corner on the
ceiling She can’t make out what it is Time stops

The shadow scuttles quickly across the ceiling It stops
right above her head Amelia is paralyzed by fear She
hears a rasping sound The thing appears to be breathing

Her hand reaches for the bedside lamp Her eyes are fixed
on the dreaded shadow right above her head

Before she can get there the thing drops down right on
top of her She sees its hideous mask like face
millimetres from her own the black eyes the mouth
wrenched open in a permanent silent scream She takes a
huge breath as if breathing the thing in terrorized

Amelia switches on the lamp springs out of bed and turns
on the overhead light Bugsy barks Samuel wakes

There’s nothing there Samuel sits up trying to focus

AMELIA
We’re going downstairs

SAMUEL

AMELIA
Because we are

INT LOUNGE ROOM - NIGHTMORNING

Amelia turns every lounge light on She moves to the
kitchen turns the lights on there Samuel watches
groggy Bugsy follows Amelia barking continuously

- Later All the lights still on The TV is up loud

Amelia tries desperately to stay awake absently hitting
the remote Commercials nature program soap opera

An old black and white George Méliés clip appears on the
screen Beautiful silent images childlike but slightly
disturbing Just like the Babadook book A weird tinkling
lullaby accompanies them seducing her to sleep

She fights it her head nodding forward and back a
drowsy agitation desperate to stay awake

The Méliés images stream in front of her People
dismembered heads growing larger and smaller old style
cinema tricks Strange and sinister

Emotions pass over Amelia’s face as she watches
agitation amusement exhaustion fear Something is
brewing She jerks forward and back her eyes heavy

Her face speeds up It looks bizarre The tinkly piano
music continues to play And still she doesn’t sleep

Amelia’s face returns to normal speed she looks around

The sun is coming through the windows It’s already
morning She leans over Something doesn’t feel right

She looks to Samuel asleep on the couch his back to her
Bugsy peers over Samuel studying Amelia with caution

She returns the dog’s stare unblinking There’s an eery
silence in the room She looks at the TV It’s on mute

Amelia suddenly lurches forward and manages to stand She
centres herself momentarily then shuffles to the stairs

she’s just done It rattles her

INT SAMUEL’S ROOM - MORNING 80

Amelia arrives at the door sheepish She sees Samuel on
his bed head down He tries desperately not to cry His
body tenses as she comes near he’s scared of her

Samuel doesn’t look at her He starts to cry It’s heart
wrenching Amelia feels it

sights are irritating loud and bright

Samuel sits in front of a large Happy Meal dark circles
under his eyes He chomps away on his french fries

Things are better the power of junk food has worked

A stabbing pain in her jaw Amelia winces She reaches
inside her mouth and feels her back molar She massages
her jaw searching for relief

is covered in cockroaches She recoils desperately
flicking them away The car swerves Samuel panics

Amelia looks in the rear vision mirror

A shadowy shape jumps onto the boot then the roof She
can hear it pounding like mad a terrible sound She
swerves all over the road frightened Samuel screams

Amelia accidentally accelerates heading straight towards
another car A screeching of tyres a sickening sound

Amelia is frozen at the wheel shell shocked Samuel is
crying It’s a miracle they’re not hurt

A young corporate guy gets out of the other car a brand
new Audi He inspects the damage then runs to Amelia

GUY
You ran straight into me

Amelia looks at him with a blank expression in shock
GUY (CONTD)
I just bought this bloody car What were
you doing
The guy looks into the back seat sees Samuel cowering
GUY (CONTD)
Oh Driving on the wrong side of the
road With a kid in the back You could

The man’s face looms large and terrible in the window
She reverses the car suddenly and screeches away as fast
as she can leaving the man bewildered in her wake

stairs straining to see

The whispers start up again taunting her She stops dead
in her tracks and the sounds stop

She stumbles on her face dark and troubled

INT LOUNGE ROOMKITCHEN - EVENING 89

Amelia stands in the dark lounge room The whispers
return only louder this time more threatening She
can’t tell where they’re coming from It infuriates her

She races into the kitchen turns on the light and
rounds the bench

She sees Samuel in his armour whispering to someone on
her mobile phone He almost jumps out of his skin

She rips the mobile out of his hand and looks at the
screen livid Mrs Roach’s name flashes up

She tries to contain her fury as she prepares to talk

AMELIA
(Calm as possible) Gracie I am so sorry

MRS ROACH
Has someone broken into the house Sam
said someone was trying to get in

AMELIA
No We’re fine Samuel’s just being very
disobedient Again

MRS ROACH (0S)
Oh I was so worried

AMELTA

bother anyone

MRS ROACH
He asked if you could stay the night
that’s no problem at all-

AMELIA
(Very nice) No we’re fine I have a
small headache that’s all I’ve got to
go now though I’m sorry for troubling

She hangs up deadly silent glaring at Sam
He looks white as a sheet
AMELIA (CONTD)
(Tight) I told you not to call anyone and
you deliberately disobeyed me
Samuel lowers his head anxious and scared
AMELIA (CONTD)
Do you want to frighten Mrs Roach An old
lady who can hardly walk Do you want to

make her sick

Sam is too scared to talk This inflames Amelia more

AMELIA (CONTD)
(Exploding) Take that bloody thing off

He takes the catapult off quick smart

Amelia takes out her phone battery chucks it in the bin
only half aware of what she’s doing

AMELIA (CONTD)
(Beside herself) Is this the only way I
can trust you won’t embarrass me in front
of the neighbours

She grabs something from the kitchen a large knife
Samuel is freaked out by the sight

AMELIA (CONTD)
Is this what I have to do

She cuts the cord to the land line shaking with anger

SAMUEL
I’m sorry Mummy I was just scared
because the Babadook made you crash the
car and then-

AMELTA
(Stopping dead) What did you say

Amelia’s energy darkens Samuel’s fear increases

SAMUEL
(Frantic) I just didn’t want you to LET
IT IN

Amelia snaps She races to the cupboard Keys jingling

SAMUEL

AMELIA

Samuel takes the pills from her He raises his arm
The pills drop down discreetly into his shirt sleeve as
he brings his hand to his mouth A perfect sleight of
hand that Amelia doesn’t see He takes a swig of water
She opens his mouth checks he’s taken them
AMELIA (CONTD)
Good boy

Hysterical sound effects from a cartoon on the TV Amelia
is dozing She jolts awake and looks over to the couch

Samuel lies there on his back His throat is cut There
are multiple stab wounds to his body His dead eyes stare
up at the ceiling his face and body soaked in blood

Amelia rushes over to him She tries to scream but
nothing comes out her face a horrible mask of fear

SAMUEL (0S)
Mum

Amelia looks at her son

He is crouched on the sofa ready to spring He’s
perfectly fine but terrified by his mother’s behaviour

AMELTA
(Shaky) Come on sweetheart Come here

He stays at the door

Amelia goes to him very gently He puts his ears back but
lets himself be picked up She strokes him tenderly her
fear dissipates They stay there like that for a moment
Bugsy suddenly bites her hand and jumps to the floor
Amelia watches him run away in shock

INT LOUNGE ROOM - NIGHT 95

TV still on Amelia brings two bowls loaded up with ice
cream marshmallows on top She’s trying way too hard

AMELIA
Here we go

Samuel looks at the bowls his face is worried and tense
She places it in front of him forcing a smile

AMELIA (CONTD)
There’s more where that came from

Samuel takes a spoonful tasting it gingerly

Amelia watches him eat tense as hell A sudden stabbing
pain in her tooth her hand flies up to her jaw It’s
getting worse She massages fear and pain in her eyes

Mother and son steal glances at each other The TV blares
over the top of their silence

Samuel’s eyelids become heavy as he struggles with then

Amelia channel surfs manically not stopping to look at
anything She finally stops on the late night news

NEWS REPORTER
in the kitchen where he beheaded his
sister reportedly a day after her
birthday She had just turned seven

Amelia watches horrified Images of a normal suburban
house cordoned off police on the scene

NEWS REPORTER (CONT’D)
Her teenage brother remained inside where
he was eventually shot dead by police

Amelia sees police on the TV pass by a window of the
house What she sees next chills her to the bone

There is a clear image of Amelia herself looking out from
the window of this suburban house smiling a disturbing
smile Amelia tries to comprehend what she sees

Suddenly all the lights snap off plunging the house
into darkness

Amelia’s breathing hardens Her eyes focus on the couch
Samuel is no longer on it Her panic increases

AMELIA
(Whispering) Samuel

Samuel is suddenly beside her It frightens her

SAMUEL
(Eyes closed) Wake up Mummy
She can see his eyes are closed

AMELTA
Darling you’re the one who’s asleep

He stands there for some time then drifts towards the
basement door eyes still closed

AMELIA (CONTD)
Don’t go down there

He opens the door A light comes on down there Samuel
disappears down the stairs

AMELIA (CONTD)
(Moving after him) It’s not safe

She stands at the top of the basement stairs watching Sam
descend She’s confused by the light being on down there
It draws her down into the bowels of the house

INT BASEMENT - NIGHT

Amelia arrives to a basement completely clear of clutter
The most beautiful ethereal light transforms it

Samuel is nowhere to be found Amelia steps into the
light and is calmed by it

Out of the shadows steps the man from the photo Amelia’s
husband Oskar a handsome man in his forties

Amelia’s face drops when she sees him Her eyes
spontaneously fill with tears She races in to him

They stay like that for a long time holding each other
Amelia cries in disbelief her emotions overwhelming her

He kisses her he’s real She melts into him letting go
into one exquisite moment

AMELTA
(Overwhelmed) I thought you were dead

OSKAR
We can be together sweetheart

She hugs him tighter in complete disbelief Long pause

OSKAR (CONTD)
You just need to bring me the boy

Amelia feels a sudden chill run over her and pulls back
from her husband It suddenly doesn’t feel right

The beautiful light has disappeared Deep shadows fall
across Oskar’s face He looks strange

AMELIA
You mean Samuel

OSKAR
(His voice distorts) You can bring me the
boy You can bring me the boy

AMELTA

Stop calling him the boy

Amelia looks down to Oskar’s hands There’s nothing at
the end of his sleeves She tries to comprehend it A
rumbling sound starts up

OSKAR
(Distorted) I think it’s going to rain

She looks up

A razor thin line of blood forms a diagonal line from one
ear across to his jaw on the other side

AMELIA
(Terrified) No

Amelia bolts up those stairs as fast as she can

INT LOUNGE ROOMKITCHEN - NIGHT

- Amelia enters the lounge room The lights have
returned flickering on and off The TV is on static

Amelia watches the overhead light flare up The bulb
smashes Complete darkness A hideous silence

Amelia senses something behind her in the kitchen She
turns slowly and is met with her worst nightmare

At the far corner of the kitchen about 15 metres away
is a hideous silhouette in the darkness A large black
coat pointy black gloves and a tall black hat

Then she hears it A terrifying insect like noise as the
thing glides straight towards her It stops towering
over her She can’t make out any details but she can
feel it looking at her suspended in terror

She suddenly tears up those stairs taking two at a time
racing into the first open door she can find The sound
of the thing screeching after her

INT SAMUEL’S ROOM - NIGHT 99

Amelia grabs a chair and pushes it under the doorknob
stumbling backwards towards the fireplace

An awful silence just the sound of Amelia’s breath

Something falls down the chimney and lands in the hearth
right next to her A black top hat

Amelia goes into a panic attack She crawls back towards
the door but her movements are slow and tortured

She can hear something huge and hideous travelling up the
wall behind her then onto the ceiling overhead An
insect-like sound fills the room Amelia can’t bear to
look up lying on her stomach frozen with terror

Something drops down nearby A black coat Amelia starts
to hyperventilate

A terrible noise flesh ripping from flesh Something
drops inches from her face The ripped off ‘face’ of the
Babadook nothing but a hardened mask Black sticky blood
oozes from its edges from the holes where the eyes
should be the mouth open in a permanent scream

In spite of her terror Amelia forces herself to look up
to the ceiling for a split second in disbelief

An huge shadow fills half of the ceiling a hideous shape
with outstretched ‘wings’ like an enormous bat

Amelia immediately looks away She holds her breath
tensing up belly to the ground beyond terror

AMELIA
(Over and over) It isn’t real it isn’t
real it isn’t real it isn’t real

There is an unbearable screeching sound

POV from high on the ceiling Something rushes straight
down towards Amelia’s back at lightning pace

Amelia’s eye in extreme close up A huge bang a terrible
scraping ripping sound Her pupil ‘bleeds’ outwards till
the whole eye is completely black

and opens the door a sliver but doesn’t venture out

INT LOUNGE ROOM - NIGHT 102

The back of Amelia watching an informercial Something’s
not right with her She breathes very fast and heavy

Her face is revealed Her eyes have a dead stare the
pupils like pin pricks Her limbs are slightly distorted
rigid She looks human but there’s something about her
that just-isn’t-right

She sits as if resting for a moment in her new skin her
casual stare at odds with her bizarre appearance She
changes channels to ‘Australia’s Next Top Model’

JUDGE 1 (0S)
She’s a great girl but she’s too fat

Amelia watches the program with a dead cool calm

JUDGE 4
I agree unfortunately

MODEL HOST
What about Cindy

JUDGE 3
Cindy is great She can do soft she can
do bold she can do sexy

Amelia cricks her neck suddenly agitated She stands and
in a few jerky moves is up on top of the old TV

JUDGE 3 (CONTD)
I think she has a lot of extremes

A stream of piss comes from between Amelia’s legs It
runs over the TV screen

Amelia’s face as she relieves herself She opens her
mouth wide clicking her jaw She looks terrible

INT UPSTAIRS LANDINGLOUNGE ROOMKITCHEN - NIGHT 103

- Landing Samuel opens the door a sliver Bugsy jumps
from his arms and races down the stairs Sam is beside
himself trying to call the dog back

- Bugsy arrives in the loungeroom bravely facing his
opponent He barks ferociously

Amelia still on top of the TV regards the dog with
casual indifference her eyes dead

She jumps down to the floor squaring off at Bugsy

A moment of stillness

Bugsy is spooked and makes a run for it

- Kitchen Amelia chases Bugsy The poor thing doesn’t
have a chance as she grabs it by the neck He struggles

trying to bite her It’s awful

Amelia’s terrible face the dead eyes fixated on the
task The sound of Bugsy squealing in pain

Bugsy’s little legs kick in spasms A ghastly snapping
sound The squealing stops dead the legs go limp

Amelia looks at the dog’s corpse emotionless Her face
suddenly scrunches up in pain she looks broken It’s her
molar She yells dropping Bugsy’s corpse on the floor

She reaches into her mouth with her fingers grabs hold
in the back wrenches the tooth from side to side
groaning horribly She pulls and tugs screaming in pain

After an age it wrenches free She looks at the bloodied
molar in morbid fascination blood pooling in her mouth

Suddenly bored with it she throws the tooth away

- Lounge Amelia stalks into the room She instinctively
whips her head up and looks straight at her son his face
peering over the bannister He disappears a door slams
Amelia’s jagged limbs move quickly like a spider She
bolts straight up those stairs to her son

- Amelia on the other side She clears her throat tries
to ‘normalize’ The pupils in her eyes contract slightly

AMELIA (CONTD)
(More normal) Samuel Let me in (No
response) Bugsy’s hurt We need to go
get help

Her voice sounds normal but her face is terrifying

AMELIA (CONTD)
Samuel Do you want Bugsy to die

Samuel silently disappears out of frame

Back to Amelia on the other side Her mouth contorts with
rage her eyes devil’s eyes She pounds on the door
growing violent

AMELIA (CONTD)
Samuel Let-me-in (No response) I’1l
huff and Ill puff and I’11 BLOW YOUR
FUCKING DOOR IN

She grabs the door frame with both hands lifts herself
up and slams the door with both feet Then again and
again over and over till the door is kicked off its
hinges and falls to the floor

Amelia enters looks around No sign of Samuel This
infuriates her

She moves in a jerky powerful way as if she has rods in
her limbs She looks under the bed behind the curtains

She hears a tiny noise swivels around in time to see her
son sliding down from the top of the wardrobe His little
frame running towards the door

Amelia lets out a screeching sound just like the
Babadook

Samuel stops and turns to look terrified

His mother glides straight towards him a spectral sight
Samuel instantly wets his pants

AMELIA (CONTD)
You little pig 6 years old and you’re
still wetting yourself

He can’t look at her puts his hands in his pockets
AMELIA (CONTD)
(Cruel) You don’t know how many times
I’ve wished it was you not him that died

SAMUEL
(Near tears) I just want you to be happy

AMELIA
(Mimicking him) I just want you to be
happee You know sometimes I just want
to smash your head against the wall until
your fucking brains pop out
Samuel backs away from her his fists clenched

SAMUEL
(Low) You’re not my mother

AMELIA
What did you say

Looking her bravely in the eyes Those terrible eyes

SAMUEL
I said youre not my mother

She bends down to Samuel her face evil horrifying

AMELIA

another They stun her long enough so he can escape

Amelia finds fresh rage She bolts out after him

His mother tears after him screaming her limbs
disjointed and ‘broken’ moving fast like a spider

- Sam’s room Samuel’s hands shake as he puts on his
weapons His eyes are wide with terror

Amelia appears in the doorway huge and terrifying She
looks at him with a cruel fascination

SAMUEL
GET AWAY

She laughs a hideous laugh closing in on the boy

He launches the cricket ball it hits her in the face
She bends over covers her face with her hands groaning

Samuel looks at his mum very worried

Amelia stands up takes her hands from her face She
laughs mocking him She’s not hurt at all

Samuel fires his nail gun off in desperation two large
rusty nails land in his mother’s shoulder She yells out
in pain This time she’s not pretending

Samuel makes a quick getaway

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT 106

Amelia comes out raging She pulls the nails out of her
shoulder looks downstairs then up to the top rooms
which way did he go

Samuel is behind her hiding in front of a cabinet in the
hall All she has to do is turn around and he’s dead He
stares at his mother’s back holding his breath

There is a loud knock on the front door Amelia pauses
Then she’s down those stairs hardly touching the ground

INT LOUNGE ROOMFRONT DOORKITCHEN - NIGHT 107

Amelia lurches towards the front door her face looks
casually insane and wholly evil

A silent swift blur of movement can be seen in the
background It’s Samuel escaping to the kitchen

- Amelia’s deranged profile looking through the peep
hole

Amelia’s POV Mrs Roach is waiting outside

Amelia’s fingers clutch the doorknob She’s ready to rip
that door off it’s hinges

- Samuel is horrified to see Bugsy’s remains on the floor
in the kitchen He tries the back door It’s locked

- Through the peephole Mrs Roach waits patiently in her
dressing gown shaky on her feet She hesitates to knock
again Her kindly face looks worried

Something changes in Amelia Her terrible expression
softens She lowers her head her breathing slows down

108 INTEXT - NIGHT -— HALLWAYFRONT PORCH 108

The door opens Amelia stands behind the locked security
grille Her face is half in the shadows

MRS ROACH
Sorry love I know it’s late I just
wanted to make sure you’re OK

AMELTA
(Clearing her throat) I’m OK

MRS ROACH
I know this time of year is terribly hard
for you And I know you don’t want me to
go on about it so I won’t

Amelia’s face behind the screen She starts to normalize
with Mrs Roach’s words her eyes full of pain

MRS ROACH (CONT’D)
I just want you to know Id do anything
for you and Sam I love you both You can
always talk to me love Always
Amelia’s face softens and saddens with every word Her
eye glints in the shadows tears forming
109 INT KITCHEN - NIGHT 109

Samuel has just closed a kitchen drawer

AMELIA (0S)
(Normal voice) Samuel

Sam jumps He turns sharply to see his mother at the
other end of the kitchen She looks completely normal

Samuel watches her caught between love and terror
AMELIA (CONTD)
(Genuine) I’m sorry I said some terrible
things But I didn’t mean any of them

She takes a step further into the kitchen Samuel tenses

AMELIA (CONTD)
I understand you’re scared

Samuel watches her very wary but drawn in by her

AMELIA (CONTD)
(Remorseful) I haven’t been good since
your Dad died I haven’t been good at
all I’m sick Sam I need help

Samuel’s face softens He listens intently

AMELIA (CONTD)

I just spoke to Mrs Roach We’re going to
stay there for the night

Amelia comes closer She kneels in front of her son Her
face is soft and terribly sad

AMELIA (CONTD)
Do you want to do that

Amelia puts one hand gently on his shoulder Samuel nods
Amelia’s hand behind her back is twisted and clenched
AMELIA (CONTD)
I want to make it up to you Sam I want

you to meet your Dad

She slips her other hand around the back of his neck
soothing him with her touch He tenses

AMELIA (CONTD)
It’s beautiful You’1ll be happy there

Samuel can see his mother’s pupils don’t look normal

Without warning he quickly raises a carving knife behind
his back and sinks it deep into his mother’s leg

She looks to him then to the knife absolutely stunned

SAMUEL
Sorry Mummy

He’s out of there

Amelia stumbles onto her arse looking in shock at the
big knife sticking out of her thigh

She reverts to something much more primitive than before
Her face distorts a picture of madness She rips the
knife out in one go yelling as she does it

Samuel races to the basement door He takes a look back

Amelia lets out a blood curdling sound as she rises

Samuel disappears into the basement

INT BASEMENT - NIGHT 110

Amelia pauses at the top of the stairs then descends at
full speed screaming like a banshee

A little hand pulls a rope a trip wire forms

Amelia’s feet connect with it She tumbles forward
hitting her head on the ceiling beam hard

She stumbles around concussed The room spins before

her she sees a brief glimpse of Samuel watching in

horror then the ceiling the floor out of control

It looks terrible as she swerves and stumbles

Sam has a baseball bat in both hands He runs to Amelia

and strikes her as hard as he can in the of the knees

She buckles and hits her head first on the wall then

hard on the concrete floor The blows knock her out

INT BASEMENT - LATER 111

Black screen

The sound of very fast shallow breathing The ceiling
comes into focus one dingy light overhead

Amelia in profile breathing super fast Her pupils are
now large and black as coals She tries to lift herself
up but despite her considerable power she can’t

She looks down Every part of her neck to toe is tied
and bound with rope belts anything Samuel could get his
hands on She looks like Gulliver in Lilliput She makes
a terrible shrieking sound struggling to free herself

Samuel slinks out of the shadows with his magician’s cape
on holding the baseball bat trembling with fear

SAMUEL
Mum

Amelia sees him She snarls threatening him

SAMUEL (CONTD)
I’m not leaving you

Amelia groans horribly trying to free herself

Samuel comes in a touch closer The monstrous Amelia
looks at him as if trying to register who it is

Samuel inches in closer Amelia stops struggling

He pulls out the bunch of paper flowers She stares at
them becoming more herself calming Sam leans in

Amelia suddenly yells even louder than before Samuel
runs to the far corner of the basement scared stiff She
laughs at his terror a monstrous agonized laugh

SAMUEL (CONTD)
We said we’d protect each other

Some of her ties have come undone A few of the others
are starting to come loose

Samuel doesn’t notice as he sneaks back towards her
trying his hardest to be brave

SAMUEL (CONTD)
I know you don’t love me The Babadook
won’t let you But I love you mummy ever
since I was born and I always will

The words get in somehow Amelia’s face screws up in
pain fighting this thing that has taken her over

Another tie works itself loose she wriggles and moves

SAMUEL (CONTD)
My dad died because he died Not because
of me It’s not my fault

Amelia’s face contorts affected by his words She gasps
for breath trying to come out of it A black tear wells
up in the corner of her eye She starts to shake

SAMUEL (CONTD)
(Desperate) You let it in you have to
get it out

The tear rolls down her face A black substance seeps
from one nostril She looks terrible shaking trying to
come back from the brink

Samuel starts to cry at the sight suddenly losing all
his strength The baseball bat goes limp in his arms

SAMUEL (CONTD)
(Bawling) I don’t want you to go away

Amelia’s arm suddenly comes free Amelia rips the bat out
of Sam’s hands and throws it across the room He tries to
get away But before he can escape she’s grabbed him

SAMUEL (CONTD)
NO NO NO MUMMY

Her other hand comes free Samuel tries to punch and kick
her she tightens the grip on the back of his neck

She takes both hands and places them round Samuel’s neck
She struggles with what she is about to do but loses out

Slowly but surely she chokes him

His little hands pull at her hands around his neck But
she’s too strong Sam’s face turns red he can’t breathe

A look of terrible recognition passes across Amelia’s
monstrous face as she realizes what she’s doing but
still she can’t stop She cries out trying to summon up
strength from the depths It doesn’t come

Samuel eyes bulge He takes both hands and with great
effort places them on his mother’s cheeks He strokes his
mother’s face full of love trying to get her to stop

It’s heart wrenching Something snaps in Amelia Her body
shakes violently Black tears rolling down her face

She throws Samuel away from her screaming out as she
sends him sliding halfway across the room

Amelia gets up on all fours shaking her head from side
to side The movement becomes so quick so surreal that
her head becomes a violent screaming blur

Samuel calls out to his mother desperate and frightened

After a time Amelia’s head movements slow down Then
finally they stop A long pause

Amelia suddenly and forcefully vomits up a black
substance It hits the floor urgently Samuel watches on
speechless It’s horrible disturbing

Just as soon as it started it stops Amelia falls face
forward and lies dead still her eyes open and staring

Samuel runs to her Desperate he grabs her shirt
pulling her up her head falls back He hits her hard on
the chest as hard as he possibly can over and over

Amelia inhales like a drowning person coming up for air
She lets out a cry a human cry this time full of pain

Samuel wipes her face and kisses her cheek grateful
she’s alive

Amelia looks around completely disoriented

INT LOUNGE ROOM - NIGHT 112

Amelia limps through the basement door holding her son’s
hand slowly coming out of her trance like state They
stand there shell shocked The house is silent

A low rumbling starts up Samuel looks all around him
then to his mum She looks at him unnerved

SAMUEL
‘Tf it’s in a word or it’s in a look
you can’t get rid of the Babadook’

Without warning Samuel’s body is suddenly ripped from her
arms An unseen force drags him up the stairs his body
bouncing as he hollers for his life

Amelia screams as she watches him disappear out of sight

INT STAIRWELLAMELIA’S ROOM - NIGHT 113
- Amelia races up the stairs as fast as she can
- She arrives at the door

Sam is standing by her bed his arms rigid He is picked
up and flung against the wall A sickening thud he looks
like a broken doll Amelia screams

She races to Sam grabs hold of his arms They’re ripped
out of her grasp Sam hits the wall again and again It’s
brutal he starts to lose consciousness

Amelia grabs Sam’s leg then locks her arms round his
waist She uses all her strength to push him onto the
bed covering him with her body gripping the edges so
she doesn’t fly up against the wall herself

The bed starts to shake violently A rumbling sound
throughout the room Amelia stares off into the shadows
acknowledging this thing as real for the very first time

AMELTA
(Desperate) What do you want

The bed lifts up then slams down violently with them on
it Amelia holds on tighter Samuel clings to her

AMELIA (CONTD)
TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT

The bed drops to the floor The sound stops replaced by
an eerie calm Sam hides his face in the mattress

The door creaks open A figure steps into the light
Amelia stands up on the bed to see who it is Sam grabs
her waist hides his face in her skirt

It’s Oskar A look of dread passes over Amelia’s face

AMELIA (CONTD)
(Shaking her head) No

OSKAR
Keep breathing

A very faint rumble starts up again Amelia can’t take
her eyes from her husband her panic becomes visible

OSKAR (CONT’D)
Put your seat back sweetheart Ten more
minutes and we’re there

AMELTA
NO

Amelia shakes tears forming The rumbling intensifies

OSKAR
I think it’s going to rain

Oskar is oblivious to the noise building around him

AMELTA
STOP

Truck tyres skid brakes screech horns blaring

A hot white light shines in Oskar’s face blinding him
The screeching sound becomes deafening

Amelia watches as the top half of her husband’s head is
severed from the ear on one side to the jaw on the
other His corpse quickly drops to the floor

Amelia stares at it her body shakes uncontrollably
tears run down her face She cries out as if she’s being
murdered an unimaginable grief

A sound starts up taunting her ‘Babababababa dook-dook-
dook

Amelia watches the corpse suddenly pulled back swallowed
up by the shadows as if it was never there She searches
the dark but can only see a formless shape lurking there

Her grief and pain transforms into anger She spits the
words out trembling hardly able to breathe

AMELIA (CONTD)
Youarenothing

The hideous growling grows more threatening with her
words Her energy rises visibly A pure white hot rage

AMELIA (CONTD (CONTD)
YOURE NOTHING

The hideous shadow grows larger rising up to the
ceiling terrorizing her The floors and walls shake

AMELIA (CONTD)
This is MY HOUSE You are trespassing in
MY HOUSE

Its growls turn to a deafening roar as the shadow touches
the ceiling a huge mass of black terror

Amelia fights a sickening gut wrenching fear as she
finally faces up to this thing

AMELIA (CONTD)
(Not turning away) If you touch my son
again Ill fucking KILL YOU

Bits of the ceiling fall to the floor The walls crack

Sams body is flipped up and pulled violently towards the
shadows He yells Amelia grabs him by the hands and
yanks him to her there’s no way she’s letting go this
time Sam wraps around her waist she holds him tight

The sound of the Babadook is deafening Its presence
takes over the room

Amelia jumps up on the bed end her son in her arms and
lets out a scream so strong so piercing it smashes
every window in the room She looks utterly fierce A
mother enraged protecting her son

Her scream dies away but her eyes are full of life She
searches the darkness

The huge shadow shrinks down from the ceiling its growls
reduce to a hideous moan The shadow is slowly and
completely lost to the darkness

The noise of the Babadook stops altogether

Amelia stands tall on the bed end searching the shadows
holding her breath

An unbearable silence

The outward figure of the Babadook just like the one in
the picture book only life size rolls in to the edge of
the shadows It looks absurd creepy its black arms
stretched out like a scarecrow

Amelia holds her breath waiting for something to happen

The ‘figure’ suddenly drops to the ground like a sack
Amelia starts It collapses into a shapeless mound of hat
and coat with nothing underneath

Amelia slides down to the floor staring at it
dumbfounded Sam jumps on the mattress face down

A moaning sound starts up under the coat Hellish but
somehow sad Amelia inches in to look her face softens

SAMUEL
(Looking up scared) Mum don’t

Amelia comes in really close now reaching out to touch
the coat checking if it’s real

The Babadook POV It rises from under the coat up to the
ceiling towering over Amelia then screeches right down
to her face We don’t see it but she does It blows the
skin back on her face her eyes widen her mouth is
forced open in a grimace Just like mask of the Babadook

And as quick as it appeared that thing is out of there
- The Babadook’s POV flying out the door Amelia and Sam
are left behind

114 INT LOUNGE ROOM - NIGHT 114
By the time Amelia makes it downstairs the Babadook has
disappeared into the basement door slamming She runs

over to it locks the door takes the key

Amelia turns Sam stands opposite her He cries then
howls completely overwhelmed his body shaking

Amelia races to him scoops him up Samuel clings to her
for dear life She strokes his head kisses his face
holding him as tight as she can

She takes him to the couch cradles him in her arms and
soothes him with her words Full of a mother’s love

They stay there like that for a long time together

INT MRS ROACHS FRONT YARD - DAY 115

Sam looks through a window He has his best clothes on
looking adorable He sees something his face lights up

The front door opens Sam guides Mrs Roach down the
steps then lets go of her hand and runs to mum

Amelia scoops Sam up in her arms She looks different
Stronger Her eyes more relaxed and alive

MRS ROACH
Watch your mum’s leg little one

AMELIA
He’s fine I’ve had the stitches out

MRS ROACH
You’1l have to be more careful around the
home It can be a death trap

AMELTA
(Not a touch of irony) I know

MRS ROACH
What time’s the party

AMELIA
Anytime after 3 is fine Just going to
have a bit of real food first before the
sugar onslaught starts
Samuel snuggles into her She hugs him back

MRS ROACH
See you in a few hours then

Mrs Roach gives them a sweet nana wave They wave back

INT LOUNGE ROOM - DAY 116

The lounge room is still run down but tidy and clean
There are homemade birthday decorations strung up

Amelia and Samuel sit on the couch side by side

The couple from Social Services sit opposite cups of tea
in hand Amelia is much more grounded in their presence

PRUE
That school’s a good choice

AMELIA
I’ve done a lot of reading about it so
I think Sam’ll be happy there

WARREN
(Stiff) He’s been away from school over
two weeks now Time to get back into it

AMELTA

(Strong) We needed time to sort things
out

Samuel nestles into his mum Prue smiles tightly

PRUE
Are you having a party

AMELTA
It’s Sam’s birthday today We’re having a
small thing just a few friends

SAMUEL
The first birthday I’ve ever celebrated

The visitors look a little shocked

AMELIA
That’s not true

SAMUEL
Yes it is mum (To the visitors) My first
party on the day

PRUE
(Pointed) That’s unusual

Amelia can see the judgement in the woman’s eyes She
decides not to let it go

AMELTA
(Not a trace of self pity) My husband
died the day that Sam was born

The DOCs couple don’t know how to respond
SAMUEL
He got killed driving mum to the hospital
to have me

Amelia doesn’t rush in to rescue them

The woman mouths the word ‘oh’ The man is completely out
of his depth just staring blankly at them

AMELIA
Sams just like his dad was always
speaks his mind

Sam is snuggled right in to his mum protected
WELFARE WOMAN
(To Samuel ignoring what just happened)
Birthday parties are always fun
especially when they’re yours
SAMUEL
My cousin was going to come but she’s
scared of me because I knocked her front
tooth out

Amelia looks to DOCs a half smile plays on her lips She
looks beautiful

Prue looks awkward her cup slipping on the saucer
AMELTA
(Getting up) I’1l take that for you
117 EXT GARDEN - DAY 117

A cross section of soil Bugsy’s corpse buried there The
flesh begins to rot Worms and bugs crawl through it

Travelling up to the roots of a plant bursting out of the
earth A rose bush Amelia’s tends to the soil around it

She admires a single black rose in full bloom

Samuel is nearby opposite the fence There’s a target
painted on it He has two home made ‘nail guns’ on either
leg He aims then fires them off in quick succession

Amelia looks up The nails hit their mark

AMELIA
Good shot

Samuel looks pleased He runs over to her

SAMUEL
I’m protecting you mum

AMELIA
(Genuine) You’re doing such a good job

He runs back to his target full of beans firing up
again

Amelia picks up another worm and adds it to a bowl full
of them She takes off her gloves and gets up

INT BASEMENT DOOR - DAY 118
Amelia is at the door which now has many bolts on it She
undoes them all as Samuel watches She goes over to where
she’s put down the bowl of sludge and worms picks it up

Sam keeps one eye on her as he tentatively sneaks one
foot into the basement She turns around and sees him

AMELIA
(Fierce protective) UH UH UH NO

He stops in his tracks

AMELIA (CONTD)
(Moving to him) It’s not a game Sam

Amelia crouches down to Sam’s level patient and loving
AMELIA (CONTD)
One day when you’re a bit bigger You
keep working on your weapons
Samuel silently accepts what she’s offering For now
AMELIA (CONTD)
(Firm) Go right out into the yard and
stay there till I call you alright

He nods and runs outside

INT BASEMENT - DAY 119

Amelia descends the stairs It’s dark and hard to see A
very faint rumbling starts up

The room is clearer than before Oskar’s things are still
there but now very neatly stacked in one corner

Amelia places the bowl of slop in the centre of the room
She steps back and waits peering into the darkness
She’s frightened but does her best to conceal it

The rumbling increases She can see a familiar shadow in
the corner moving ever so slightly A low insect like
noise She braces herself peering in to try and see it

A sound behind her The back of Amelia’s head as she
turns around her eyes widening

Amelia is knocked off balance then twisted and bent
backwards Her arms grab at the air to try and right
herself She grunts and groans her face is forced to one
side The sounds around her are horrible threatening

Amelia seen from above She is bent right back as she
forces her head to look up She lets out a low guttural
warning sound then a shout full of power

Her back releases slightly she is able to right herself
standing eye to eye with something we don’t see Her face
is tense her pupils dilate She looks afraid but
something else is there now Something soft and sad

AMELTA
(Tenderly through the fear) Ssh Ssh
It’s alright it’s alright Ssh
She stays there awhile Her breathing is laboured her
pupils now huge and black A tortured moan off screen
She continues to soothe and reassure it undeterred

Time stretches A moment of peace

Amelia’s eyes return to normal The POV falls away from
her dropping to the floor Amelia stands over it

The bowl of slop there on the floor untouched Nothing
else can be seen in the room

In one quick move the bowl is sucked into the darkness

Amelia walks backwards to the stairs She turns and
climbs them as quick as she can without running

EXT GARDEN - DAY 120

Amelia carries a tray filled with sandwiches She sets it
down in front of Samuel He has his magician’s outfit on

SAMUEL
How was the Babadook

AMELTA
Pretty quiet today

Amelia reaches up and undoes his top collar inspecting
the bruises on his neck She can’t hide her shame

SAMUEL
(Gently) It’s much better mummy

She brings her hand up to stroke his cheek looking at
him with love She puts a sandwich on Sam’s plate

SAMUEL (CONTD)
Wait I’ve got a new trick

He runs to get a silver dome off the ground races back
and plonks it on the table

SAMUEL (CONTD)
Life is not always as it seems (Waving
his hands) Nothing in my hands nothing
in my hands

He makes something appear in his palm it’s a coin

AMELTA
(Impressed) Very good

SAMUEL
Wait I haven’t finished

Amelia watches on intrigued

Samuel places the dome over the coin He grabs a spoon
and taps it on the top for special effect He whips the
lid off and underneath is a bird A real live bird

Amelia laughs with surprise

AMELIA
(Shocked) How did you do that

The bird flaps around on the table Samuel does an
impromptu jig around his mum very pleased with himself

She laughs enjoying his dance She tries to grab hold of
his arm He wriggles free happy laughing

AMELIA (CONTD)
Come here

Amelia finally catches his arm drawing him to her She
hugs him and puts him on her lap He stops wriggling
around and settles in relishing his mother’s love

A quiet beautiful moment neither of them say a thing
Amelia rubs her son’s back he snuggles into her

AMELIA (CONTD)
(Quietly after more than a moment) Happy
birthday sweetheart

Sam breaks into a smile He closes his eyes and leans
into his mother his face beaming

THE END
