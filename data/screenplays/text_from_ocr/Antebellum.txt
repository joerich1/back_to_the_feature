WHITE LETTERS ON A BLACK BACKGROUND

“The past is never dead It’s not even past”

William Faulkner
FADE IN — SUPER LOUISIANA
EXT PLANTATION — EARLY EVENING

The gloaming drapes a lonely plantation in burnt oranges and
yellows The Great House sits atop acres of endless perfectly
manicured cotton fields guarded by giant hundred-year-old moss
trees — replete with cows roaming at pasture a few scarce
chickens and a brood of quarter horses It is late Summer the
heat is stifling omnipresent unrelenting

We follow a little BLONDE GIRL who can be seen skipping past the
endless rolling greens dragonflies buzzing about in her wake
We spot her rosy cheek from the faint profile — she appears to
be just shy of ten years old at the most — her long ponytail
whipping in the wind donned in a floor-length linsey-woolsey
dress buttoned all the way to her throat Without a care in the
world she grips a tiny fistful of wildflowers

Blindingly white sheets can be seen rolling like ocean waves in
the Southern Summer breeze A few young black women slaves are
busy pinning sheets carefully to the clothesline They’re
dressed in ecru-colored lace Chantilly dresses which button up
all the way to the neck A trio of grinning Confederate
soldiers pass proudly in their army-issued grays and tip their
hats toward the women slaves which the girls acknowledge with
odd forced plastic smiles their eyes dead with a hint of
terror under perspiring brows — a sinister current shadows the
cordial exchange Once the Confederates have safely passed the
women slaves’ seemingly friendly expressions are immediately
replaced with a look of absolute horror

As we continue our exploration of the plantation we see an old
wooden pole about 12 feet high with a singed tattered
Confederate flag billowing in the breeze We pass behind a REGAL
WOMAN in a peach-colored formal dress with long strawberry-
blonde hair she is standing just at the edge of The Great
House We catch the profile of her face as she stares toward a
forest in the distance The little blonde girl has now joined
her and hands her the freshly picked wild flowers before gently
clasping her mother’s white laced-gloved hand

Emerging from the forest nestled just at the bottom of the
plantation’s property we see a freshly recaptured female slave
hoisted over the backside of a beautiful silk black horse ——
she is being lead by a CONFEDERATE CORPORAL Her face obscured
we only see the drip trail left behind by her bloody mouth —
her body bouncing up and down in rhythm with the horse’s trot
all the while a commanding shadowy figure follows closely
behind

In the distance located on the clay dirt road just adjacent to
the Great House —— we notice a row of a half-dozen or so
cabins all identical — save for a rusted-out shed with a
stumped chimney we see a gaggle of Confederates struggling to
separate two recaptured runaway slaves (one male one female)

Super-tight shot of the female runaway slinked over the back of
the horse EDEN — a rail thin youngish beautiful black slave
maybe mid-thirties — lies limp bobbing up and down on the
backside of the horse her face resting on the saddle bag Her
mouth is dripping blood when her eyes suddenly widen clearly
surprised by whatever she has discovered in the saddle bag

They continue their march across the plantation Eden doesn’t
blink again until the horse begins to slowdown before arriving
in front of cabin 4 —— we now clearly hear the disturbance as
it has grown louder more urgent

When the beautiful silky black quarter horse comes to a
complete stop Eden moves her tongue over her lip trying to
locate the source of the gash when suddenly without warning
she is dragged feet first down from the saddle —— her head
smashing on the soggy Louisiana soil We see only the boot of a
Confederate as he warns her to not move an inch before heading
toward the other soldiers —— who are still trying to regain
control of the recaptured escapees in the distance

Cabin 4 sits lonely and unkempt evidenced by the overgrown
brush and horse post in front where grass and wild weeds have
replaced fading hoof prints The dirty curtains which cover
the only two windows billow intermittently from an errant
breeze We notice Eden’s gaze is trained on the saddle bag
before the horse is lead away leaving only the corporal’s boots
as her view —— her eyes then follow him as he runs toward the
commotion

Super-tight shot of a STRIKING YOUNG SLAVE WOMAN skin like
black porcelain with razor-sharp cheekbones her face decorated
with a septum ring that reads she may have only been recently
stolen from the Gold Coast of Africa She is being pulled away
by a gimpish Confederate while refusing to break her stare with
ELI a healthy young buck with a wisdom in his eyes that cheat
his years

Eli has a draconian collar around his neck hes shirtless skin
glistening with sweat and what appears to be whipping scars
creeping up the back of his left shoulder Breathless from the
failed escape he is being carried off in the opposite direction
by a couple of Confederates Tears are welling in his eyes as he
tries desperately to maintain eye contact with the woman slave
who shoots him an earnest apologetic stare

SLAVE WOMAN
(low whisper almost mouthing
the words in a thick Ghanaian accent)
I’m sorry

She wipes her tears away before kissing a small crucifix
fastened at the end of her delicate gold necklace She then
breaks away from her soldier and makes a run through the cotton
fields toward the nothingness with the kind of speed that could
only be powered by the sheer will to escape the nightmare of
slavery one way or the other

JASPER the head overseer — a young ginger-bearded white man
with a deceivingly polite manner tips his hat with an amputated
ring finger he sits atop his horse at the edge of the field
while calmly watching the escape play out as if solely for his
entertainment A perimeter guard shoots off a warning shot and
glances toward him A commanding Jasper raises his hand — he
has this

JASPER
(to his horse)
Get

Jasper and his right-hand give chase as if for sport The
corporal and his palomino sidle up beside the runaway slave as a
lasso pulls the back of her neck snapping her violently back to
earth Eden and the other slaves look on in disbelief of the
suicide run and the ease and brutality of the capture Jasper
can be seen in the distance dismounting his horse as the
corporal looks on Jasper kneels down studying her face
quizzically The rough rope has rubbed the slave girl’s neck
raw she is crying but says nothing at first and then

SLAVE WOMAN
Kill me Just kill me you bastard

Jasper doesn’t break his stare for a full 10 seconds
JASPER

Oh — don’t worry girl I will
accommodate you
This is your second attempt
It WILL be your last

Jasper then tightens the noose and slowly walks back to his
horse - deliberately prolonging the torture He ties the rope to
the other end of his saddle as the runway begins crawling
scooping handfuls of earth as Jasper follows behind one slow
boot at a time — savoring every moment

We slowly zoom in on the little blonde girl’s face who is still
holding hands with her mother we notice her smirk grow into a
devious smile

The two horses now appear more like a painting than real life as
Jasper pulls out his shotgun and without hesitation shoots the
crawling runaway point blank in the back Eden watches in
horror

Eli screams using his full lung capacity veins protruding from
under his neck collar —— he begins punching and kicking the two
corporals who are barely able to contain him as he tries
desperately to free himself extending his shackled arms toward
the murdered runaway

ELI
(screaming)
NO

Eli almost breaks free when one of the corporals reverses his
rifle and strikes him across the head with brute force knocking
him unconscious

The corporal then reappears beside Eden who has just witnessed
this horrific event Without hesitating he drags her feet
first toward cabin 4 As she claws away at the earth toward an
imaginary freedom she sees the murdered slave woman’s body being
dragged into the burn shed just adjacent to cabin row Eden’s
eyes begin to well up with tears as we turn toward a close-up of
the flag waving in the wind

Black slaves urgently collect linen baskets and clothespins at
the line before scurrying for cover as if taking shelter from a
fast approaching thunderstorm

We finally see the shadowy figure who was following so closely
behind Eden HIM stands at the end of the clay dirt road
surveying the estate as the Confederate soldier exits cabin 4
and salutes
HIM is in silhouette — a substantial intimidating white man
exiting his middle-age years with brown thinning hair donning
his Confederate army-issued grays Judging by the stripes he is
aman of great authority in the Confederacy We dont get a
clear enough look at HIM’s face to survey the wrinkles and
weather — he appears to move like a ghost in shadow His gait
determined as he makes his way into the cabin where upon
almost immediately we hear blood-curdling screams from a
terrified Eden

INT INSIDE CABIN 4

Eden is perched on her tiptoes in the corner As she moves from
her frozen position we hear a heavy rusted chain that leads to
her raw and bleeding cuffed ankle

As HIM approaches we hear the loud creaks from the bending of
rotting wood Eden struggles to cover herself before HIM swats
her across the torso repeatedly with the buckle-end of his
belt HIM puts his entire body into each lash — his generous
back outlining the sweat-soaked Confederate-issued pea coat as
he administers each swing Eden begs for mercy from a God that
doesn’t answer and the General who coldly ignores her pleas

HIM
(drenched in a sandpapered
Southern drawl)
God says
you have no right to your freedom
I am responsible for you now
and I will tame your savage ways —
THIS is your home now
(pauses for a moment to get his breath)
It brings me no joy to do this
work but it is ordained and you will
obey me as your earthly master as
intended by our forebearers (pause)
You will speak only when I instruct
you to speak Do you understand me

She nods her head yes trembling uncontrollably hoping to
prevent further assault

HIM
Now What’s your name
Say it girl What’s your name
WOMAN
Please Stop

HIM slaps her with his bare hand opening her lip and right eye

HIM
What’s your name girl Say it
(whap )
I’m losing patience with you — say it
WOMAN

Eden My name is Eden
HIM nods in the affirmative

EDEN (CONT)
It’s Eden My name is Eden

HIM
(satisfied)
Good Eden That’s real good
Everything will be alright
You can stop that crying

There is a long pause between them — Eden is clearly jolted by
the sudden change in tone from HIM For a moment they both bathe
in uncomfortable silence but Eden’s reprieve is short lived

HIM (CONT)
Now Please stand up for me

With just the strength of her now compromised legs Eden raises
herself cautiously to stay balanced flinching at even his
slightest move HIM takes Eden gently by the chain tie and leads
her to a small unremarkable dinette table just across from the
now raging furnace

HIM (CONT)

Youve given me no choice Now bend over
(gives her a moment)

Go on Do it

(places his index finger over her lips)

Now trembling in pure terror tears streaming down her bruised
cheeks Eden reluctantly bends over HIM takes Eden in full view
before tacking her arms over a peg located underneath the leaf
end of the kitchen table There is complete silence as HIM walks
away toward the fire to remove a branding iron Eden squirms
trying to locate her tormentor but it’s no use HIM lands the
branding iron just at the small of her back — the skin sizzles
as Eden’s guttural scream pierces the air Eden defiant
unsuccessfully tries to hold back tears while concentrating on
a specific space on the wall (adjacent to the bed) as HIM
attempts to reduce her will to ashes

HIM (CONT)
(deadpan)
«your nigger friends are dead because
of you You know that right
Try it again and
I’1l drag you to the burn shed myself

Eden’s lifeless legs flailing like a corpse soul emptied body
resigned HIM covers her mouth with his enormous hand
suffocating Eden under the weight of his big body while she
squirms and screams from the searing burn For good measure HIM
concludes his violent attack with clinical precision adding an
inaudible sinister whisper of instruction in the ear before
finally releasing his grip Eden then slinks back down to the
floor into fetal position

HIM (CONT)
(casually lighting up a cigar)
Now be my good girl and clean up this mess
(in between puffs of cigar smoke)

Eden tries to control her wheezing from the smoke wafting
directly in her face

HIM (CONT)
Maybe I can get away for supper tonight
Would you like that
You can make us a chicken

Him exits the cabin door signaled by the hinges screaming out a
long exaggerated squeal — leaving Eden shocked limp and
lifeless on the floor Once Eden hears the door close she
finally takes in a gasp of breath and begins to shake and cry
uncontrollably Her screaming is so low almost inaudible

Eden makes her way to the window where she sees HIM untie the
beautiful black quarter horse from the post out front — once
again she trains her gaze on Daphne’s saddle bag

HIM acknowledges Eli instructing him to retrieve Eden a chicken
for supper
HIM
Get DAPHNE Get

As HIM and his horse disappear into the now setting sun — past
the cotton fields beyond the nothingness — we see a soldier
lower the Confederate flag from the pole announcing the
General’s departure Eden stares out at the flag pole before
making her way to the bed where she crawls in and begins to
weep in guttural screams

CuT TO BLACK
“ANTEBELLUM”
EXT PLANTATION COTTON FIELDS — SIX WEEKS LATER

About a dozen or so slaves pepper the cotton fields of the
plantation in absolute silence

We find Eden among the other slaves fingers bloodied from
liberating cotton from stalk Cannons and gunfire from a battle
can be heard in the distance A thunderous sound rolls across
the sky as the slaves entranced all follow something overhead
in unison that has stolen their attention

Jasper is on his horse a few yards way

JASPER
Yall seem easily distracted
Let’s break up this monotony
and get you focused Sing us something
Perhaps one of those ole’ negro tunes

He and his fellow overseers laugh heartily as the slaves look to
one another Eli leads with a faint eerily familiar whistle
before the other slaves join in with a collective humming Their
impromptu performance is interrupted by intermittent gun and
cannon fire which leaves Jasper and his men unfazed

JASPER
(motioning to Eden to approach)
Girl
Your Master will be back this evening
I would suggest you get yourself together
He’ll be expecting a good supper

Eden is silent

JASPER
You have my permission to speak girl
Do you understand me

EDEN
(in a whisper)
Yes

JASPER

Yes what

EDEN
(hesitates)
Yes Sir

JASPER
Now that’s better After you
finish here get yourself cleaned up
I’1ll send ole Eli up there directly

Eden continues liberating cotton from stalk her bale brimming
with cotton —— her fellow slaves never look up from their
duties perhaps in a silent acknowledgement of the exchange
except for one woman slave we spy in profile whispering to the
slave beside her

We only see the hooves of Jaspers chestnut horse in a leisurely
trot as we pan up to reveal him removing a long handle rifle
from the saddle holster Jasper then flips the rifle to the
wooden handle effortlessly with one hand before windmilling it
like a polo mallet —— landing a devastating blow to the back of
the whispering slave womans head —— she collapses like a sack
of potatoes

JASPER
(Jasper calmly places his index finger over
his lips and tilts his head to one side)
Shhhhhhh
(beat)
Next time I won’t be so generous

Cannon fire can still be heard in the distance and remnants of
musket smoke now waft in the air

JASPER (CONT)
Back to work All of you
Let the sound of Confederate
victory bring joy to your labor

The slaves pick up their pace as ordered barely glancing at
one another As the disruption settles the cruel monotony of
cotton picking is only amplified by Louisiana’s Indian Summer —
the heat stifling stubborn the sun wicked in its unrelenting
scorching From the clear blue sky a sound like thunder rolls
across the fields as the slaves look up in unison yet again

INT CABIN — LATE AFTERNOON

Eden is methodical in her preparation of the cabin Setting the
table just so the bed made up to military standard Eden then
moves over to the door vigorously slathering butter all over
the door’s hinges Once finished she gets up catching her
reflection in the non-glass mirror and caresses the small of her
back There is a knock at the door

Eden opens the door to reveal Eli standing there She slowly
shuts the door in his face before re-opening The door squeaks
Eli looks at the door hinges and shoots Eden a concerned look

EDEN
(without missing a beat)
Well be fine
(hands him the bucket and ax)
Milk Chicken

Eden abruptly closes the door as if she’s just spotted
something or someone —— we then see Jasper in the distance
spying on their exchange

EXT CABIN ROW - DAY

Eden is hanging freshly cleaned linens on the clothesline in
front of the cabin In the distance a buggy with a new batch of
human chattel — a half dozen or so — approaches the Great
House Their clothes tattered faces bruised tender chapped by
the blistering sun

From a distance we see the same strawberry blonde woman and her
young daughter weighing and measuring the new slaves before
they are hosed down and reloaded into the buggy Jasper and a
handful of his subordinates — who sit on horseback at a safe
distance appear to take in the indoctrination of the new slaves
with a visible curiosity if not complete fascination

JASPER
(yelling toward cabin row)

Eden Get down here girl —
Hurry up we don’t have all damn day

Eden makes her way down to Jasper and the buggy of unfortunates
at a brisk but cautious pace She finds Jasper dismounting from
his horse to allow closer inspection

The buggy of slaves all mid-20’s to early 30’s at most range
from high-yella to black satin They appear shell-shocked but
also strangely bewildered by the nightmare of slavery

JASPER
(loudly and proudly)
Welcome home one and all

Jasper takes a particular interest in the youngest — JULIA a
beautiful doe-eyed nymph in her early 20’s with tight curls
and amber eyes that read defiant As Julia disembarks from the
buggy she loses her balance and falls down to all fours digging
her fingers into the earth trying desperately to regain
herself but her emotions seemingly get the better of her as dry
heaves give way to vomiting We notice a marking on her lower
right ankle perhaps a birthmark

Disgusted Jasper turns away and then comes right back to Julia
who is now recovering

JASPER
What’s your name girl

JULIA
My name is
(she hesitates and looks around at the
other slaves as if asking for permission)

JASPER
(impatient)
Girl

JULIA
(barely audible)

My name is Julia

JASPER
Oh I think you forgot something girl

Julia looks around at the other slaves confused and searching
their eyes for the correct answer before Jasper grabs her by the
face squeezing her jaw with his dirty gloved hand

JASPER (CONT)
I don’t know where you came from or how
you addressed white folk before but here
you will always address me and any white
man as “Sir” Do I make myself clear

JULIA
(still confused but keeping it together)
Yes sir Sorry sir

JASPER
That’s better Now listen up
All of you This here is a reformer
plantation- commandeered by the 9
infantry of the Confederate army of
the 13 States Wherever you were
before — whatever small freedoms you
may have enjoyed Im here to tell
you — that’s over
I dont tolerate any back
talk whatsoever in fact the rules
on this plantation are that you only
speak when given permission to do so
That means absolutely no speaking among
yourselves unless one of the white folk
on property gives you permission to do so
If you do — we WILL know about it
(looks across the whole group)
And none of you under any circumstance
are to be out after sundown
(pauses to ensure that resonates)
Now right up this hill you will
find your cabins you’ll also
be given instructions by one of the
overseers as to your daily duties —
which are to be followed obediently
and with a smile Here we whistle while
we work Ain’t that right Eli

Eli acknowledges the question with a nod as Jasper continues

JASPER
That’s right So Are we clear

None of the new arrivals speak still stunned appearing to look
at each other for some semblance of solace that never comes

JASPER
You have permission to speak
Now let’s try this again
(annunciates absurdly)
Do I make myself clear

They all answer in the affirmative in unison

JASPER
That’s good

The slaves all exit the buggy as Jasper reunites with his horse
and motions over to one of the young Confederates

JASPER (CONT)
(with pride)
Raise the flag
The General returns this evening

As the soldier begins to raise the Confederate flag we see Eden
leading some of the girls up the hill with the youngest Julia
following close behind

JULIA
(to Eden)
Psst what is

Eden grabs her forcefully by the arm before Julia can even
finish her question

EDEN
(yelled whisper)
Quiet

The terror in Eden’s eyes was enough for Julia and all of the
newly arrived slaves within ear shot — they follow Eden’s lead
in both silence and pace leading up to the row of modest cabins
We notice through a gap in one of the cabin doors a slave woman
working a cotton loom

INT EDEN’S CABIN — NIGHT
Eden can be seen in her tattered soiled dress hair pressed

back skin clean — she is preparing the cabin for HIM’s
imminent arrival She tends to the chicken making sure the meal

has been prepared just so The small dinette table is set
illuminated by the two kerosene lamps that serve as the cabin’s
only light

Daphne’s bated breath and dignified trot signal Him’s arrival

HIM
Whoa Daphne That’s my girl

Eden makes her way to the corner of the cabin to await Him’s
entry We only see his size 12 Confederate army boots as he
enters the cabin

HIM (CONT)
Eden How I’ve missed you girl
Come over here and let me see you

Eden gingerly makes her way over and catches a glance from Eli
before the door closes

HIM (CONT)
No need to be afraid

Eden says nothing but obediently follows the instruction moving
in allowing herself to be enveloped by Him’s big body

HIM (CONT)
You may speak girl You miss me

EDEN
Yes Yes sir

HIM
I know Missed you too Terribly
Ooh You feel so goddamn good

Him starts licking Eden’s neck while sticking his dirty hands
under her reeking and tattered dress

HIM (CONT)

Among my concubine you are my
greatest prize

(stares at her)

The Northern aggressors will never
take you away from me

(as he runs his fingers across the
branding he administered

still licking while talking)

You know that don’t you

EDEN
Yes Sir

A sustained thunderous sound from above echoes through the cabin
to which both Eden and HIM react

HIM
(wiping sweat from brow)
Sounds like a storm’s coming maybe
it’ll break this God forsaken heat -
It’s October for crying out loud
(looks out window)
Remember we got some brave boys of
the Confederacy headed this way
(pause)
I‘1l expect you and the girls will
show them some real Southern hospitality
(looking down at her)
«you should get a bath

EDEN
Yes Sir

HIM
Alright good First let’s eat

As HIM and Eden fall out of frame we slowly pan out from cabin
window Once we are a few yards away and time passes the cabin
suddenly goes silent as the camera continues the slow pan out
revealing the entirety of the cabin a restless Daphne and the
black vastness of their surroundings The kerosene lamp is then
extinguished rendering the two cabin windows pitch black

DREAM SEQUENCE

A little girl is laying on top of Eden — theyre hiding from
someone under what appears to be a burlap blanket Eden is
covering the little girl’s mouth trying desperately to keep her
quiet

END DREAM SEQUENCE

EXT CABIN 4 — DAYTIME

We only see a stark white sheet ripping the air — from outside
the cabin window — it’s one of the young slave women pinning

sheets to the clothesline We find Eden staring out the window
before taking a seat on the floor beside the bed Her hand
outstretched resting on the wall — she seems to be slowly
scraping a groove into one of the wooden wall planks with her
thumb and index fingers when she is startled by a rap at the
door Eden wipes her tears before standing up to gather herself
and moving to answer the door As she did before she closes the
door and then re-opens The squeak is no more

ELI
(slaughtered chicken in tow he looks Eden
directly in the eye — in a hard whisper)
WHEN

EDEN

(returns his stare)

If they raise the flag
(pause)

We go tonight

Eli nods in recognition before turning back as Eden closes the
door

Eden begins to tiptoe across the wood planks back toward the
grooves at the edge of the bed as we hear yet another rap at the
door At the same time the plank she is standing on lets out a
loud squeak Eden turns around clearly frustrated and swings
the door open quickly

EDEN
(without even really looking)
I told you
She cuts herself off as she realizes it is not Eli It’s Julia

She only stares at Eden clearly distraught

EDEN
(looking in both directions to be
sure none of the overseers are on
guard before acknowledging Julia)
Get in here girl

Eden takes Julia’s hand and leads her to the dinette to sit
They stare at each other in silence for a moment before Julia

begins to speak Julia is out of focus her words muted until

JULIA
(quizzically)

Have we met before

Eden says not a word and continues to stare straight ahead
vacant of emotion

JULIA (CONT)
(barely moving her mouth)
I’m from North Carolina
(Pauses remembering for a moment)
Seems like forever ago
(snaps back to her new reality)

Julia sits in the uncomfortable silence waiting for Eden to say
anything in futility — Eden remains standing Julia pulls ona
few strands of her hair and begins nervously wrapping a long
piece around her index finger She repeats the nervous tic ——
twisting and then unraveling the same section of hair Edens
expression changes as if ruminating on a thought she is unable
to keep secret — indicated by just a hint of warmth that creeps
over her face Eden leans toward Julia perhaps to calm Julia’s
nervous tick but at the last second thinks better of it
instead resuming her cold stoic posture

JULIA (CONT)
I was married
(pause)
I mean I AM married

Eden closes her eyes and exhales unaffected Julia can’t wait
any longer for a response from Eden that doesn’t feel like it is
coming any time soon

JULIA (CONT)
I HAVE to get back to my husband
(pauses staring at Eden calmer tone)
I need your help
I know you and Eli are friendly
He won’t say a word to me Nothing
You must have SOME kind of plan Right

Eden only stares at her contemplating what she will share
JULIA (CONT)
(Desperate crying uncontrollably)

I can’t do it I just can’t do it

EDEN
(calmly and in a quieter tone)

Listen to me

You need to forget wherever you came

from before here

Bury it if you have any hope of surviving
(looks down at the table)

Your mind has to be strong —

that’s how you cope You have to stay

JULIA
(in a harsh tone)
No No no no That’s not possible for me
(looks at Eden inspecting as if
she might be able to see the answer
in her eyes before saying earnestly)
What are we doing What is the plan

Eden looks down at the table

EDEN
(puts both her hands on the table)
You think we haven’t tried
There WAS a rebellion
five people slaughtered
(pauses remembering
looks directly at Julia)
Listen to me carefully —
here on this plantation
your second chance IS YOUR LAST

Eden flips up her waistcoat revealing the brand on her back
She then takes Julia by the elbow ushering her toward the door

EDEN (CONT)
We must choose our moment wisely
But for now we keep our heads down
and our mouths shut

Eden relieved to now have Julia outside of her cabin slowly
begins shutting the door satisfied she’s convinced Julia to her
way of thinking Julia suddenly shoves her foot between she and
the door

JULIA
You HAVE to help me
(staring directly into Eden’s
eyes — very close almost nose-to-nose)
I’m pregnant

Eden is jolted and although she tries to temper her reaction
her facial expression gives away her surprise at hearing Julia’s
news

EDEN
Listen to me — you must keep quiet
(looking around)
«they will kill you

JULIA
(cuts her off in a loud whisper)
You think being quiet is being strong
You think that’s gonna get us outta
here alive

Julia locks eyes with Eden for what seems like an eternity

JULIA (CONT)
It turns out you ain’t special

Eden pushes her out of the door once again but Julia is having
none of it and forces the door back open

JULIA (CONT)
You ain’t special at all You just a coward
nigga slave with a brand and no backbone

Eden manages to slam the door successfully this time leaving
Julia standing alone and exposed on the front porch

Eden contemplates for just a moment clearly fighting the urge
to comfort Julia she instead softly rubs her hand against the
surface of the door Confident Julia has finally retreated Eden
calmly moves back toward the dinette set and takes a seat
returning to her trademark seemingly emotionless state

Eden stands back up expressionless placing her hands on her
face in thought inhaling exhaling Then suddenly with one
violent motion she swats away all the tin plates candles and
cups from the table clearly frustrated she pounds her forehead
with the palms of her hands

Eden then retreats to the corner of the room where she quickly
regains her composure She calmly sits on the end of the bed
before standing back up and then returning to a seated position
she repeats this odd dance several times before extending her
legs over across specific swaths of the floor as if playing a

bizarre game of invisible hop-scotch — we hear a loud creak from
the floor as Eden moves across

EXT PLANTATION — NIGHTFALL

As a soldier raises the Confederate flag an impressive caravan
of tall thin torches lights up the night sky It is the
Confederates’ triumphant return from the battlefield The sound
of boots marching in concert with the collective baritone chant
Blood and Soil provide an eerie menacing soundtrack to the
otherwise quiet plantation

The slaves stand with vacant stares the women all dressed in
long stark white cotton dresses while the male slaves are in
ecru tattered shirts buttoned to the neck — they all stand
perfectly rowed as the Confederates make their way up to the
mess hall The young soldiers’ bare faces begin to come into
focus only illuminated by torchlight There is unified anger
and defiance read in their expressions

INT MESS HALL — DINNER TIME

A dozen or so Confederate soldiers none over 30 are seated at
a communal table in the plantation’s packed mess hall bayonets
by their side The slaves serve them with faint seemingly
forced smiles and not so much of a whisper — as instructed
Julia and Eden among them The boy soldiers all eating from
tin plates with only kerosene lamps to illuminate the hall
giving a grim sinister quality to their baby faces

The soldiers appear to be in good spirits celebrating their
victory and bragging about the successful defeat of the “Yanks”
at Williamsport They eat ravenously mouths open — lacking
even a modicum of decorum The celebration is interrupted by
the clanking of a chalice at the front It is HIM A hush falls
over the hall

HIM
First I want to congratulate you
all on your victory at Williamsport
And now with our defeat of the
Yanks at Gettysburg it seems weve
got those blue-bellied bastards on their
heels Washington in our sights

The mess hall erupts in applause while we see two of the slaves
sharing a long strained stare

HIM (CONT)
But we must never relent

Jasper gestures and mess hall goes quiet

HIM (CONT)
We are descendants of the Gods and will
fight with the same immeasurable courage
and vigor We will sacrifice our blood
that will stain this soil of our homeland
This is the only hope we have of retaining
our heritage our way of life

All of the young Confederates cheer in adulation We see one of
the few young white women in the mess hall — a sandy-haired
petite belle — as she makes her way over to one of the
corporals She puts her hands on his shoulders and begins
massaging him to his clear delight — as they continue to
listen to HIM’s speech A young soldier whispers in HIM’s ear

HIM
I’ve just been informed we received
a new batch of recaptured escapees
that require some behavioral
correction and that reminded me
(takes a moment)
We are of rightful inheritance to
this land and rest assured our National
Estate will not be stolen from us by these
traitors to America You all are the
future the brave men of the Confederacy
who will lead us to ultimate victory
For tonight let us put away our troubles
drink and be merry You’ve earned it
all of you Enjoy yourselves And by
the way these sapphires are here to
serve your needs Whatever they may be

The whole room laughs in unison before erupting in applause
Jasper walks up next to HIM and raises his hand We now see
that the strawberry blonde woman was standing slightly behind
HIM (who appears to be her father) for the entirety of his
speech The woman’s daughter runs up the aisle to give her
mother a goodnight kiss before returning to what appears to be
her mammy (a slave)

JASPER
(pounds the table)

Faith Family Folk

THE WHOLE ROOM
(pounding the tables)
Faith Family Folk

Julia stares across the room at Eden who stands expressionless
COMMUNAL TABLE OF YOUNG CONFEDERATES

PURCELL a young corporal handsome clean-shaven whistles
toward Julia while cheered on by his comrades Next to him is
DANIEL a less handsome Confederate — skinny scruffy with a
slightly effeminate disposition He is not as boisterous and
does not cheer — he keeps his head down toward his food

PURCELL
Angel Yeah you come here I dont bite

DANIEL
(meekly shaking his head contrarily)
Man

Eden looks over from across the room concerned for Julia Julia
cautiously makes her way to the group of rowdy Confederates

PURCELL
(Toward Julia)
What’s your name Mine’s Purcell

Jasper irritated takes a sip from his chalice while standing
behind the group

JASPER
Her name’s Julia
corporal

Red-faced the young Confederate soldier acknowledges Jasper
respectfully before motioning for Julia to come closer

PURCELL
Well hello Julia

Pleased to make your acquaintance

JULIA
Hello

PURCELL
You sure are pretty Have a face
like an angel How bout I call you
angel Would that be okay with you

Hesitant but compliant Julia nods

PURCELL (CONT)
My compadre here was just telling
me that he thinks you’re real pretty

DANIEL
(blushing not making eye contact)
Nah man no

PURCELL
What You don’t think she’s pretty

DANIEL
No I mean yes of course I do

PURCELL
Well then She ain’t gonna say no
(motions toward Julia)
Talk to her
(under his breath to 2)
You’re in charge here

Julia stands there waiting for this scene to come to some sort
of conclusion so she can get on with it

DANIEL
(politely and hesitantly)
Julia ugh well I

JASPER
(exhausted by this pitiful exchange)
For fuck sake
(to Julia)
He will meet you back at your cabin
immediately following dinner service
You are dismissed as of this moment
(looks Julia dead in the eye)
Go prepare for your Corporal

Julia nods toward Jasper and Daniel

JASPER

(angrily)
What’s that girl

JULIA

(in a whisper)

Yes

That’s more like it

sir

JASPER

Now go

PURCELL

(To Corporal 2)

Enjoy

I’m headed round back

to the whipping post

Lashing
is much

As Julia makes her way back
inebriated young men bursts
emotionless careful not to
escorted out to her cabin

INT JULIA’S CABIN

Daniel stands just inside the door to Julia’s cabin
but he stands there

behind him
the situation

We see Julia across the room

the backs of uppity niggers
more satisfying anyway

to the kitchen the table of
out in laughter Eden looks on
reveal her dismay before Julia is

It is shut

Frozen In awe of Julia and

seated at the edge of the bed

staring at him her face illuminated by the kerosene lamp

If I may

JULIA
I didn’t get your

name earlier

DANIEL

(caught off guard)

Daniel

(the first “Daniel” had a little

crackle

He affirms)

It’s Daniel

JULIA

(feeling slightly more at
ease from his shyness)

Well Daniel

I appreciate the compliment

Daniel looks confused

JULIA (CONT)
From earlier You said I was pretty

DANIEL
Oh Well yes I mean of
course you are Anyone can see

Julia smiles as she slowly stands up She walks toward the
young soldier with a deliberate pace maintaining his attention

JULIA
Well thank you again Sir

DANIEL
No no need for the “Sir”

JULIA
(her confidence building)
Well it’s been such a long time
since any man was nice to me
I appreciate the compliment is all
(looks him in the eye)
How’d you get to be so sweet
(still walking toward the soldier)

Daniel simply looks down unsure of how to answer the question
He then looks back to Julia to help move the conversation

JULIA (CONT)
I mean youre so young
How old are you You even twenty

DANIEL
(looking down)
Twenty-one How old are you

JULIA
(looks a little confused herself)
Twenty-three Maybe twenty-four

He looks at Julia in a loving way as if he understands her

plight He puts his hand on her arm She reaches up to touch
his cheek tenderly

JULIA (CONT)
(whispers into his ear in a skeptical
but understanding tone)
You know you don’t have to do this
(pause)
I can tell you’re special

The soldier stares at Julia

JULIA (CONT)
(still in a whisper)
Please help me get out of here
(pause)
You have no idea
(she pulls back slightly to stare
at him he could be her chance)
You’re not like the others those monsters

The soldier looks intensely at Julia

DANIEL
(returns her gesture in kind
resting his hand upon her cheek —
we notice what looks like a class ring)
Why did you speak to me

JULIA

(confused)
You mean when your friend called me over

DANIEL
(deliberately louder and more directly)
NO Why did you speak to me when
I entered the room just now

JULIA
(slightly uncomfortable but still
thinking she can handle him smiles)
Well I just thought we should be
properly introduced
They slowly move together toward the center of the room Daniel
moving forward and Julia stepping backward

DANIEL

(dry)
You have a short memory then

You heard Commander Jasper

You speak only when given
permission to do so

(his hand slides down from her
cheek toward her neck)

Is that not right

JULIA
Yes Sir I mean Daniel

DANIEL
No It’s SIR

Suddenly the young corporal backhands Julia across the face
her lip busting wide open from the class ring she just misses
the bed post and crashes to the floor The corporal’s shoulder
bag hits the ground with a thud Daniel puts his boot next to
Julia’s face gesturing toward her

DANIEL (CONT)
You don’t know shit I’m as much a
man as any Confederate here Just cuz I
don’t want to sleep with a filthy mongrel
instead of my own kind doesn’t make me
(hesitates — stammers)
I’m a patriot You understand me

JULIA
Yes sir sorry I didn’t mean

DANIEL
Just shut the fuck up You’re lucky
I don’t tell Jasper You best make him
believe I had my way with you if
you know what’s good for you

JULIA
Yes sir

Julia reaches for the young corporal’s boot hoping to diffuse an
increasingly unpredictable situation Daniel attempts to kick
her hand away from his boot but accidently lands his foot
directly in her gut

DANIEL (CONT)
(short breath out remorseful)

Ugh sor---

Frustrated he moves toward the door

EXT OUTSIDE JULIA’S CABIN

Cloaked in darkness Eli walks one of the corporal’s horses down
cabin row It is quiet — with only the sound of crickets and the

occasional hoot of a lone owl in the background
We hear brisk footsteps approaching Eli from behind

EDEN
(in a whisper)
Pssst

Eli startled turns around quickly to see Eden approaching
mid-stride crouching low to the ground By this time we are
only about 20 or so yards from Julia’s cabin

ELI
(to Eden)
What are you doing out here
Youll get us both killed
You have to get back before they see you

Eden is now crouching just behind Eli using the horse for
cover

EDEN
We need to We have to hold off
We can’t tonight

ELI
(surprised and clearly beyond frustrated)
What No tonight — we go tonight

EDEN
No
It’s Julia
We have to take her with us
She’s pregn

Eli has no time to respond they spot the young corporal now
standing in Julia’s cabin doorway Agitated — he interrupts

DANIEL
(to Eli)
What you looking at nigger
Don’t just stand there —
bring me my fucking horse

Eden walks alongside the horse hidden from view as Eli
approaches Eli deliberately leads the corporal’s horse just
past the corner of Julia’s cabin giving Eden just enough space
and cover to slide from behind the other side and conceal
herself from view of the corporal (or an overseer)

As we pull out we see Daniel mount his horse and make his way
toward the cotton fields beyond the nothingness —— as Eden
moves in shadow back toward her cabin

EXT COTTON FIELDS — SUNRISE NEXT DAY

The cavalry of boy soldiers make their way past the cotton
fields where the slaves are already fast at work liberating
cotton from stalk The stoic band of overseers lead by Jasper’s
eagle eye stand guard Eli walks among the rows collecting
baskets — he looks to Eden for any sign any update but
nothing They both silently wonder about young Julia who
finally makes her way down to the fields — her eye is slightly
black and blue and her lip is cut

JASPER
(tipping his hat with a smug smile)
I trust you had a good night Youre
excused for your tardiness this time
Dont make it a habit or the stocks
will be waiting for you

Julia nods her head and makes her way to join the other slaves
in the fields She settles in next to Eden Eli is maybe 20
yards away Jasper on mounted horse behind him

EDEN
(to Julia — motioning to her lip)

You ok

Julia looks up toward Eden — her eye and lip clearly visible —
she stares at Eden a long while before

JULIA
Please

EDEN
I know Be patient

A tear streams down Julia’s cheek — her muffled cry now on the
verge of eruption She puts her hands up to cover her face

Eden looks over toward Jasper who is occupied with his favorite
pastime of harassing Eli She reaches toward Julia putting her
hand on her back and pulling Julia’s hands away from her face
before wiping her cheeks clean

EDEN
Just keep going Keep going

We move past Eden and we slowly push in on Julia who is doing
her best with the cotton Suddenly she reaches for her stomach
and looks down We see a blood stain expanding on her dress and
dripping onto the dirt below A tear slowly makes its way down
her cheek

JULIA
(increasing volume with each “no”)
No no no no no no no no no

Eden immediately turns to her putting her hand over her own
mouth Eden doesn’t see the blood Julia then slowly turns
toward Eden revealing her dress By this time Jasper’s
attention has been diverted from Eli to Julia Eli looks on
toward Eden as if to say “what is going on” Eden shoots hima
look we have not seen from her before and Eli knows exactly what
to do

As Jasper is headed away from Eli on his horse Eli sings out
just loud enough so Jasper can hear

ELI
CRAC-KA

Jasper immediately whips back around

JASPER
What the fuck you say boy

Once Jasper is distracted Eden huddles over Julia doing her
best to sooth her in the moment

JULIA
Why I just don’t understand

EDEN
Shhh It’s ok it’s ok

JULIA
It’s not ok

(louder now)
It’s NEVER gonna be ok

Jasper now hears the disruption and turns back toward Julia

JASPER
(to Eli)
I’ll be right back for you

Jasper approaches Eden and Julia

EDEN
(to Jasper)
She is sick sir

JASPER
What The fuck Is the issue

He then sees the blood and thinks he understands the problem

JASPER (CONT)
Ugh go get cleaned up — Now

EDEN
May I go with her sir

JASPER
She can handle herself Get back to work

Julia tries to stand and falls She gets right back up and
takes a step and falls again her face right in the dirt

JASPER (CONT)
(disgusted)
Clean her up and get back here

Eden rushes to Julia’s side and holds her up as they walk back
toward cabin row Jasper then makes his way back toward Eli
coming up behind him on his horse and kicking him in the middle
of his back

JASPER (CONT)
Now what were you saying

Eli says nothing

JASPER (CONT)
You know what
(now louder for all to hear)
The shed needs cleaning

Too many foolish negroes with
rebellious hearts

Jasper laughs and looks to the other soldiers who join in the
cackling chorus

JASPER (CONT)
Go get that cleaned up boy That should
keep you from flapping those gums

None of the slaves are looking but all are listening We can
see the dread on each of their faces as they all contemplate
this horrific task Sadness overwhelms as they keep working

JASPER (CONT)
Get

ELI
Sir — yes sir
(under his breath)
Cracka ass cracka

Eli walks over toward the burn shed as Jasper turns his
attention back to the other slaves scolding one of them with a
whip to the face for not working fast enough

INT BURN SHED — MINUTES LATER — SILENCE

A creaking of the door follows a loud thud as daylight floods
the shed Eli’s feet take a couple steps inside — he enters as
if walking on broken glass The burn shed is empty Scanning
the floor inside we see pieces of charred wood evidence of
desecrated bodies Upon further inspection we notice what
appears to be some sort of gold jewelry Eli fishes through the
dirt and ash to retrieve a delicate gold necklace He cleans it
off and loops it over a couple of his fingers — thats when we
recognize the small crucifix fastened at the end (from the young
woman’s suicide run) We see Eli’s face — clearly thinking
about its owner — her horrible end He kisses the crucifix and
then carefully lifts the necklace over his head and places it
around his own neck

Eli takes in a moment of silence as the spirits of the departed

wash over him He has clearly performed this macabre task
before but the psychological torture proves too much to bear

He suddenly begins to tear the shirt from his body his mouth
agape screaming with no sound before collapsing to the ground
Eli lays on the floor of the shed as we slowly pull out from the
door across the field past cabin row

EXT PLANTATION - NIGHT
We move in on a corporal slowly raising the flag
INT EDEN’S CABIN — SAME NIGHT

We find Eden sitting at the edge of the bed arms outstretched
as she continues slowly caressing the same spot on the wall

her left foot tapping nervously Eden then crawls over to the
furthest side of the bed where she extends her right leg back
toward the floor careful to avoid hitting the mattress with her
knee before stepping down and gingerly navigating the creaky
wood planks

Eden appears to be repeating the same strange hopscotch we
observed earlier with the same resulting squeaks on the wood
floor She then returns to the wall and presses her hand against
the etching while squeezing her eyes closed

We notice the cabin is prepared just so the table is set pots
piping on the fire stove in back Eden stands releases her
hands from the wall and walks toward the window We see a torch
flickering in the distance It is Him Eden retreats to the
corner of the cabin —— as is customary when greeting HIM ——
staring at the floor head down both hands clasped and resting
on her dress when we hear a restless Daphne out front

HIM
Whoa girl settle down Settle down
Youre my favorite girl aren’t you

HIM dismounts Daphne dragon saber dangling torch in hand

HIM (CONT)
(louder yelling to Eden)
Eden Get on out here and
get Daphne settled

Eden immediately moves to exit the cabin As she opens the

door it lets out a creak Eden looks toward it in frustration
before moving quickly toward Daphne

HIM (CONT)
(pushes past Eden to enter the cabin)
And how’s my second favorite girl

Eden gives HIM a nod as she exits the cabin She approaches
Daphne and caresses her beautiful coat before their foreheads
instinctively meet for a loving nuzzle — which immediately calms
the horse While their connection is apparent Eden’s eyes
appear mesmerized by Daphne’s saddle bag

She is suddenly summoned back to reality by HIM
HIM (CONT)
(yelling)

Hurry up and get back in here girl

Eden quickly secures Daphne before making her way back to the
cabin as instructed

EDEN
Yes sir

HIM
You hear me How is my second favorite girl

EDEN
I’m doing real fine sir Real fine

HIM
What I like to hear What’s for supper

EDEN
Lamb stew Eli finished the slaughtering
just this morning
HIM
A full belly and a good sleep is
just what I need
Him secures his saddle bag tightly — extending his arm just
enough so we can see his watch They enter the cabin HIM
closes the door

TIME PASSES MAYBE AN HOUR

INT CABIN IN BED SAME NIGHT

We see Edens face on HIM’s side shoulder — expressionless
vacant of emotion They both lay silent for a moment

HIM
(as if to his wife of 20 years)
Sweet dreams Eden
Sleep tight

EDEN
(holds back a physical dry heave)
Good night sir

The cabin is still save for the rustling of Daphne outside The
kerosene lamp burning the last of its oil in the corner serves
as the only light Him is in a deep slumber while Eden lays
awake staring at the ceiling Her expression sad hopeless as
we see her eyes begin to fill with water She succumbs to
exhaustion closing her eyes and pushing out a lonely tear

Eden and HIM are now both fast asleep It is pitch dark —
deadly silent An iPhone rings

CUT TO
INT
The same iPhone ring continues
In the pitch dark — eyes startled shoot open before taking a
dramatic deep gasp of air — clearly awakened from a nightmare

now summoned back to reality by the familiar ring of her cell
phone

Camera pulls out

INT MODERN BEDROOM - MORNING

The iPhone rings once more as a manicured hand extends out from
luxurious pristine white sheets and fumbles to find the phone

on the adjacent night stand

EDEN

(groggy)
Morning

WOMAN ON PHONE

Morning VERONICA Just making
sure you are on time getting

ready for your flight The car
will be there at 9

The electric blinds which cover the giant floor-to-ceiling
glass windows slowly begin raising in perfect unison — barely
make a sound — allowing morning sun to flood the sizable
minimalist designed ultra-modern bedroom

VERONICA
Thank you Steph

Veronica (clearly the same woman as Eden but with remnants of
make-up and looking quite a bit more polished) ends the call and
places the phone back on the night stand As she does a man’s
hand gently pulls a few strands of hair away from her face
Veronica rolls over to rest her head on his generous chest
revealing the hand belongs to a strikingly handsome African
American man in his mid-to-late thirties with a slight beard
kind eyes and just a hint of salt at the temples

MAN
(softly)
The phone startle you

VERONICA
Oh yeah — no I’m good
Just just a god awful drean
I can’t even remember it now
(looks around foggy)
Ugh I have to be out of here by 9
Can you do me a favor

NICK
Anything

VERONICA
Can you get Ken all dressed for me

NICK
Of course my board meeting was
pushed back to 11 anyway

VERONICA
I’m gonna barely have enough

time to get ready for this flight

NICK
I gotchu

lightly running his hand up her leg
over the white sheet)

But would it be the worst thing in
the world if you missed it

(looks up at her)

VERONICA

(returns his gesture with a little
playful tap on his butt and smiling)
You’d like that wouldn’t you
(turns head)

Not today

They sink back into bed for a moment and Veronica seems to let
her mind drift

Veronica smiles and shifts her weight toward the edge of the
bed before getting on her feet — she is wearing a maroon
Spelman sweatshirt and royal blue Columbia University boxers

As Veronica rises she immediately grabs the small of her back
as if she’s felt a sharp sudden pain

As Veronica makes her way toward the bathroom we hear tiny feet
running on the floor it’s KENNEDI (about 4 years old with tight
curls and amber eyes — she could be a miniature version of
Julia) She bursts into the room jumping right on top of Nick

VERONICA
(half yelling from the bathroom)
Hey Ken Ken — Daddy is going to
get you dressed and ready for
school — no dilly dallying

KENNEDI
(looks at Nick with all the
seriousness in the world)
I know exactly what I want to wear
(dragging Nick)
Let’s go Daddy

The door to the bathroom is slightly ajar A dresser to the
left of the door is covered in framed family photos — some of a
teenage equestrian — a young Veronica Before Veronica closes
the door to the bathroom we hear the shower turn on As she
steps into the shower we see her back has no tattoo or branding
of any sort — the shower door creaks

She takes a moment under the water with her eyes closed to
enjoy the quiet and the warmth She lathers

INT KITCHEN — ABOUT 15 MINUTES LATER

Nick is under the stovetop looking for a pan while Kennedi is
seated at the counter Veronica walks by the entryway to the
kitchen popping her head in for a moment Nick peeks out from
under the stovetop

NICK
Hey V — check the TV

Nick smiles and points to the refrigerator after finding the
pancake griddle

NICK (CONT)
«paused it for you

Veronica looks toward the refrigerator door and touches the
screen to play It’s a split screen CNN segment with Veronica
and a talking head — a Hoover Institute Fellow — he’s white
appearing to be in his early 60’s with a head full of white

hair We catch him mid-sentence animated finishing his point

The chyron reads Timothy Paul Hoover Institute TPHoover )

TALKING HEAD
(raising his voice and gesturing with
his hands)
Listen I come from three generations of
Harvard Grads — my father and my father’s
father attended and came to this country
with only the shirts on their backs
(satisfied with that statement)
We all sympathize with the plight of
Black America to a point but

(wrapping up)

Political correctness has taken the place of

bootstrapping It’s hard work that should
be rewarded not the preferential treatment
we see with affirmative action

HOST
Veronica I only have 15 seconds left in
this segment Your response

The chyron reads Veronica Henley Sociologist and NYT Best-
Selling Author of “The Coping Persona” - VHenley81)

VERONICA
(calmly and concisely)
I would say this
My version of a meritocracy wouldn’t include
granting admission to top-tier schools
simply because your father can write
a 3-million-dollar check
(pause)
Perhaps providing a gifted black or brown
student — who doesnt necessarily have the
financial means or familial connections — an
equal opportunity — would solve the
stubborn problem of mediocrity masquerading
as excellence

HOST
Well unfortunately we are out of time

Veronica turns the screen off and smiles to herself Nick
extends his fist toward Veronica from across the breakfast
counter

NICK
Boom

KENNEDI
(repeating her dad)
Boom

Veronica strokes Kennedi on the head just as she is about to
leave the kitchen

KENNEDI
Mommy why was that man so mad

VERONICA
(grins)
Baby girl I’m still trying to figure
that out myself

Veronica walks toward the door of the kitchen
VERONICA
Gotta take a quick Skype session

— be right back and then we will do
“good-byes” ok

Kennedi begins nervously twisting her hair around her index
finger and only manages a nod Veronica stops abruptly and
changes course and moves into the kitchen quickly where she
sidles up next to Kennedi

VERONICA
You good baby

Concerned she releases Kennedi’s finger from her hair in a way
that appears routine Kennedi nods her head “yes” Veronica
kisses Kennedi on the forehead before making her way out of the
kitchen back toward her office

INT VERONICA’S HOME OFFICE — MINUTES LATER
Just as she sits down her phone lights up from a text

STEPHANIE 826AM
Hey Veronica --
5-minute warning for your 830AM —
I already notified her that you have a hard stop at 855

Veronica picks up her phone and quickly replies with a simple
“Thx” text

Veronica pulls out her laptop from her bag and places it on her
desk next to a TED Talk folder with her name at the top

VERONICA HENLEY PHD
LICENSED PSYCHOTHERAPIST
Author “The Coping Persona”
Sociologist and CNN Contributor

Before going any further she checks herself in a compact mirror
and turns on an additional light The shelves in the background
are filled with family photos and a mix of Veronica’s equestrian
trophies

Nick pops his head around the doorway and stares at Veronica for
a moment with a loving smile on his face He clears his throat

NICK
Vegan pancake

VERONICA
On a Tuesday What’s the occasion

NICK
I was informed it’s pancakes or nothing
«gotta pick our battles

VERONICA
Emm-hmmm Got it
Nah I’11 grab something at
the airport
(sincerely)
Thank you babe

NICK
Team work makes the dream work

Nick taps the doorframe twice before turning back toward the

kitchen

VERONICA
Babe

Nick pops his head back in

VERONICA (CONT)
Second thought
I’1l take one pancake
please thank you

NICK
I got you

Nick pulls the knob but the door doesnt close all the way

Veronica re-settles in her chair opens Skype and dials in On
the screen appears a strikingly attractive young white woman
early 30’s with bone straight strawberry-blonde hair with more
of a smirk than a smile with vacant crystal blue eyes She is
clearly the same woman from the opening scene

She is polished with a conservative professional appearance
appearing to take the call from the driver’s seat of her car

VERONICA
Hi Elizabeth

ELIZABETH

(a cheerful Southern accent but obviously
well-educated placing a little

attitude on the title “Dr”)

Yes Dr Henley

Good morning -- So nice to meet you
That lipstick looks great on you
complements your skin

«I could never pull that off

VERONICA
Thank you (clearly off put)
Good to meet you as well
And please it’s Veronica
I apologize for our call being truncated
this morning
I’m traveling so it couldn’t be helped
I know you’ve been trying to get
on the schedule for a while so I hope
this is okay

ELIZABETH
Absolutely Veronica You’re a busy girl
I appreciate you squeezing me in

VERONICA
Of course --
So how did you hear about me

ELIZABETH
Oh I saw you on one of those
legacy media networks
(pause)
It was a roundtable discussion on
lack of “inclusion”
(pause)
Anyway I found your position quite
interesting but it was more how you
carried yourself that caught my attention
(surprised)
You were just so articulate
So in control of yourself
It was clear to anyone watching
that your opponent didnt stand
a chance
That silly man was putty in your hands

Veronica’s expression is growing increasingly impatient

Awkward pause

ELIZABETH (CONT)
I was impressed
Must have been a ratings bonanza

VERONICA
(trying to be agreeable)
Well yes
That segment garnered the network
quite a bit of “spirited” mail

VERONICA (CONT)
But may I ask how did that
segment pique your interest
and inspire you to contact me

ELIZABETH
I think you mentioned your book
(pause)
Well you definitely mentioned your
book actually
(looking away at something out of view
clearly distracted)
I remember because it seemed odd to
be peddling your wares in that particular
moment the high tension of it and all
(pause)
But we all have to make a living right
(awkward grin)

Veronica grows squirmy and uncomfortable

VERONICA
I must politely disagree
Perhaps you were distracted and didn’t
see the entirety of the segment
My work focuses on the intersectionality
of race class and gender
(pause)
and as a result I’ve been targeted with
some pretty disgusting online abuse —
not to mention constant attempts at
gaslighting on social media
(pauses briefly organizing her thoughts)
I wrote “The Coping Persona” as a
supportive tool for historically
marginalized people

(becoming confused and irritated

as to why she has to explain herself)
I’m sorry which publication did you say
you were with again

ELIZABETH
I didn’t
But full disclosure
I’m really more of a talent scout

VERONICA
(feigning interest at this point)
Really So you’re a headhunter

ELIZABETH
Yes
(begins giggling bizarrely)
I’m a headhunter Exactly
(looks past Veronica and points)
Is that Kennedi

Shocked Veronica looks behind her and sees that Kennedi has
propped herself up on the couch — a notebook in one hand and a
crayon in the other — obviously wanting to be a part of her
mom’s work looking like she is taking notes Veronica
immediately moves the laptop to push Kennedi out of frame

ELIZABETH (CONT)
(as if looking at an animal in the zoo)
She is just SO cute She would be a
great lil companion for my daughter
I see a play date in our future

VERONICA
Ok I’m sorry but at this point

A loud double car beep sound can be heard outside the house A
fraction of a second later the same beep can be heard on the
Skype audio

VERONICA (CONT)
(tilts head almost recognizing the
double beep but distracted)
I have to go

ELIZABETH
No Problem Didn’t mean to trigger you
Good luck at the summit Be safe
(waves while still grinning)

Veronica quickly disconnects from Skype and closes her
computer completely baffled by the strange woman She shakes

it off before re-packing her laptop scooping up Kennedi and
exiting the office

On her way to the kitchen she opens the front door The black
car on her tree-lined street is a little early and waiting for
her She waves to the driver Kennedi on her hip and puts up
five fingers to signal she will be ready in five minutes

Veronica and Kennedi re-enter the kitchen with Nick

VERONICA
(to Nick)
Well that was bizarre

NICK
Oh yeah What happened

VERONICA
(pressed for time)
Oh I mean nothing that
woman was just so off
(ugh)
the car is outside

VERONICA (CONT)
(shakes it off looking toward Kennedi)
You guys be good while I’m gone

Kennedi suddenly begins to cry uncontrollably screaming
appearing inconsolable
KENNEDI
Mommy — do you HAVE to go
I don’t want you to go
Stay home with me Please
(wiping her tears on her face
with her little fists)

Nick looks over to Veronica with an expression that reads this
behavior is unusual

VERONICA

Oh baby girl — Mommy is going
to be right back I promise

In fact I’ll be back before
the weekend so I can take you to
Catie’s birthday party

KENNEDI
(Barely audible)
But WHY can’t I come with you

VERONICA
I will be so busy baby you
would be bored
(looks to Nick)
Plus who’s going to take care
of Daddy while I’m gone
(Nick looks at Kennedi as though
he is helpless)

They share a long pause Kennedi is mulling it over Still not
convinced

VERONICA
You know what In a couple days when
you look up in the sky and see the big
airplane you’ll know thats mommy
flying home to you

KENNEDI
Ok Mommy
(getting over her tantrum she
takes another handful of granola)

Confident that Kennedi is recovering she caresses her cheek
VERONICA

(to Kennedi )
Who’s the strongest girl in all the land

KENNEDI
(flexes both her biceps)
Me

VERONICA

And what’s her name

KENNEDI
(smiling)
KENNEDI HENLEEEEEY

VERONICA
That’s right

Now fully recovered from her meltdown Veronica continues to
keep her upbeat

VERONICA
(to Kennedi )
You know who I’m going to see

KENNEDI
(now excited)
WHO

VERONICA

Auntie Dawn

KENNEDI
Auntie Dawn

VERONICA
Want me to tell her you say
“I love you Auntie”

Kennedi smiles and aggressively nods her head up and down

Intuitively Nick grabs a tissue and hands it to Veronica with
one hand and runs his hand over her head with the other
Veronica then wipes Kennedi’s cheeks and nose

NICK
Ahh the notorious Auntie D
I can’t imagine what y’all are
gonna get into
(hums Notorious BIG’s “Big Poppa”)

VERONICA
Re-live our undergrad years
in one night obviously

A second car beep echoes from outside

VERONICA
Ugh — I am off
I’1l text you when I get in
Shouldn’t be too late
I love you both the MOST

Veronica hugs Nick and plants a big kiss on his lips to which
Kennedi sneers Veronica then goes to release the hug while
Nick keeps on holding her wanting the hug to go on just a
little longer Veronica smiles before pulling her face back
looks at Nick in the eye and gives him another short peck on the
lips before they break their embrace

Veronica then moves over to Kennedi giving her a dozen kisses
all over her face before walking toward the door

NICK
(points to Veronica as she
heads out the door)
Love you babe

As seems to be their routine she points back at him before
turning to head out the door

Kennedi suddenly makes a beeline for her mom before she can get
out the door — she has a mauve-colored piece of construction
paper in her hand waving it around as she sprints toward
Veronica
KENNEDI
Mommy wait
I almost forgot This is for you

Kennedi hands her mom the picture she was drawing back in
Veronica’s office It is a beautiful stick figure drawing of
Nick and Kennedi and a plane overhead with “Mommy” on top

VERONICA
Thank you baby I need this
I’m putting it with all my
important papers
(puts it inside her briefcase bag)
And will hang it on the wall in my room

Kennedi is very happy with this reception Veronica gives her
one more kiss on the forehead before walking out the door

INT AIRPORT — DAY
Veronica makes her way through the airport We can now fully
see her perfectly tailored suit and appreciate her commanding

presence juxtaposed with her effortless beauty

Pulling her small Rimowa roller luggage behind her she is
making her way to the gate She passes by a Hudson Booksellers

where there is a stand right out front Veronica lets out a
small grin and after she passes by we can see why Her book is
prominently on display — her face on the cover “The Coping
Persona” Veronica Henley PhD

Veronica steps onto the people mover just as she receives a
text She continues her confident stride and reads the text

DAWN 1147AM
When do you get in bitch

Veronica smiles and quickly replies

VERONICA 1149AM
Late tonight

She steps off the people mover and moves to her gate just as
they are calling for first class passengers as she quickly adds

VERONICA 1150AM
bitch (with a smile emoji)

Veronica files into the first-class line to board Just as she
does a man taps her on the shoulder from behind Startled
Veronica spins around instantly to find a WHITE MAN in his early
50’s with salt and pepper hair that looks to be more on the
salty side He leans in and whispers

MAN
(plainly without emotion)
Excuse me
This line is for first-class

Veronica breathes out releasing a knowing smile while her eyes
dig into his for just a moment before

COUNTER AGENT
(to Veronica)

Ticket please

Veronica swipes her iPhone in a slightly exaggerated way in
front of the man and places it above the scanner

The light turns green
COUNTER AGENT (CONT)

(to Veronica)
Have a nice flight Ms Henley

Veronica brushes off that episode quickly makes her way down
the jet bridge and onto the plane She stows her carry-on and
quickly but thoroughly wipes down the armrests headrest and
tray table with a sanitary wipe before settling into her seat

As the flight attendant offers her a glass of champagne we see
a woman several rows back in coach — is it Elizabeth from the
Skype session

The strawberry-blonde woman is staring up at Veronica in first
class

Just as the woman leans over and peeks her head into the aisle
to get a better look at Veronica a large man and his wife stop
in front obstructing our view while they stow their luggage

Veronica relaxes in first-class She reaches into her purse for
her Chanel lipstick and applies before checking her phone one
last time She fully extends her arm holding the camera as far
away as possible and slightly overhead and presses the big red
circle on the bottom of the screen to record and we see a “live”
icon pop up at the top Veronica is in the foreground and the
first row of coach in the background

VERONICA
Why hello you lovely people
Can’t wait to see all your faces
at the Ted X
(turns the camera out the window
and then back on herself)
«On my way

Veronica pulls the phone back closing Instagram as a new
message from “Bae” pops up Its a selfie of Nick suited up for
work he is at the wheel parked in what appears to be a school
parking lot We see Kennedi peering over from her car seat in
the back both make identical kissy faces into the camera

Veronica replies with a heart emoji before placing her phone on
airplane mode and putting the sleep mask over her eyes

CuT TO BLACK
INT WE DON’T KNOW WHERE WE ARE BUT IT IS HOT

Extreme close-up of Eden or Veronica’s bare face she hangs
upside down beads of sweat gathering on her forehead she

appears to wince in pain eyes closed she is concentrating
intently on something internally Her eyes shoot open with the
same direct emotionless and penetrating stare from the opening
scene

As we pan out just a bit further we notice her upper body is
shaking Is she being punished Are we back in the nightmare of
cabin row with Eden

MAN
Ok release The yoga practice
makes us as light as a feather on
our feet Slowly dismount and lower
yourself and let’s lay on our backs
for final rest for just a moment ——
as we gather our thoughts on the day
ahead bringing positivity to each and
every situation you may face today
Visualize addressing any challenge
with unrelenting focus and emerging
successful and victorious on the other side

Veronica and the private yoga instructor have their mats laid
out in the living room of Veronica’s luxurious hotel suite The
curtains are drawn the room is calm and light spa music plays
in the background

As we pan the hotel suite we can see the picture Kennedi painted
for Veronica pinned just above her bed Veronica looks up

INSTRUCTOR
Namaste

VERONICA
Namaste

A loud knock at the door is followed by an exaggerated “Veeeee”
WOMAN OUTSIDE DOOR
“v I cannot hold this tea any longer
It is about to spill
Veronica cracks a smile
VERONICA
(to Instructor grins)

Positivity and light right
(loud enough so the woman outside

can

hear)

Good morning Dawn

Veronica opens the door
butterscotch complexion)
moves through the door

A healthy full-bodied black woman (of

with an impossibly infectious smile
into the room and leans up against the

desk facing Veronica all in one fluid motion

The yoga instructor is gathering her mat and towel as Dawn gives
her the look of death as if to say “get out of here I have

something to say”

VERONICA

(gathering up her energy)

How

is the 1 relationship therapist

in the land this morning

DAWN

Fantastic as per yoosh
(looking around perplexed)
It is sweltering in here

Oh

VERONICA
sorry — was creating my own

version of Bikram

DAWN

(nods — gets it)

Ok

first

(overly dramatic pause)

How

is my favorite little

human -- Miss Ken Ken

VERONICA

(big smile comes across her face)
My little miracle Ugh just amazing

She

told me tell her Auntie Dawn she

loves you

DAWN

Oh Miss Ken Ken
Or as the world will have to address

her

in a few decades

“Madam President”
(smiles)
Emmmph Love that girl LOVE HER

Veronica smiles before Dawn quickly moves to her next thought

DAWN (CONT)
So You know Camille
(waiting for confirmation)

VERONICA
Yes but no -- I can’t
I simply cannot indulge in your
perennially hot tea at the moment
I must get ready
I love you But you know that
(pushing her out the door)
I will see you down there

Veronica shuts the door

About 5 seconds later just as she is walking away from the
door there is a loud knock Veronica spins back around and
opens the door in one fluid motion

VERONICA
Girl I have to ---

It’s not Dawn Instead a tall slender strange looking white
MAN maybe forty stands in front of her staring strangely back
at Veronica He bears a striking resemblance to Jasper’s right
hand

STRANGE MAN
Ms Henley

The man extends his arms
VERONICA
(said almost as a question)
Yes
The man is holding a beautiful bouquet of wild flowers
identical to the flowers that the little blonde girl gave to her

mother

STRANGE MAN

Delivery

VERONICA
Oh oh thank you so much
(puzzled)

Front desk didnt call

do I need to sign anyth---

The delivery man cuts her off gruffly handing Veronica the
flowers and abruptly turning away and walking down the hall
Creeped out by his whole vibe Veronica closes the door and
places the flowers on the table She reaches for the card

The card simply reads “Look forward to your homecoming X”

Veronica tilts her head and grins now recovered from the weird
interaction

INT HOTEL LOBBY — AFTERNOON

High-heels click loudly on the marble floors of the hotel lobby
as Veronica makes her way through Veronica navigates a
measured balance of restrained femininity and polished self-
assured dominance only amplified by her Louboutin heels and
Celine bag Her quiet confidence and determined strut tells the
world that she is not to be toyed with This is her world

As Veronica makes her way through the lobby she clearly feels
the weight of someone’s stare from the corner of her eye back by
the elevators Shrugging it off she joins the short line at the
concierge desk when she is tapped aggressively on the shoulder —
she belts out a scream and whips around with a quickness

Veronica clearly startled looks up and a wide smile slowly
replaces her look of concern We see SARAH a beautiful woman
with dirty blonde hair — impeccably dressed in a decidedly
professorial way She is joyful positive and happy -- and
obviously has much love and affection for Veronica who she also
warmly calls “Vee”

SARAH
(arms open wide)
Veeeeee I’m sorry
Didn’t mean to give you a scare

VERONICA
Sarah Beee
No Not at all
Travel has me jumpy I guess

Veronica and Sarah embrace and then as if rehearsed give each

other two playful air kisses obviously poking fun at women who
air kiss

SARAH
You Look Gorgeous
What the hell are you doing
other than making us all look
less-than

VERONICA
My dear no one’s making you look
ANYTHING less than exquisite

Trust
SARAH
(points toward Veronica)
Believe
(pause)

Pssssh Sooo will I see you at my
“Harnessing Your Past Lives” panel

VERONICA
(in a serious tone)
The past is never dead
(slight pause)
it’s not even past

SARAH
Faulkner exactly

VERONICA
My grandmother used to say sometimes
the ancestors haunt your dreams to
seed themselves forward

SARAH
Oooh your grandmother was a wise soul —
the unresolved past can certainly
wreak havoc on the present
She succinctly covered my entire panel
discussion in 10 words or less
Welp suppose I can cancel it now

VERONICA
Absolutely not — Nana’s superstitious
heirlooms are no match for your years
of research
(pause)
Ugh I hate that I am going to miss it
I have a walk-through with Camille
(looks at watch)

About two minutes ago
I will see you both there right

SARAH
Come on You know it

VERONICA
Perfect — and I will eat up this panel
tomorrow morning online and share it with
the world
Hopefully the plane’s wifi will cooperate

SARAH
By the way Dawn has NOT stopped
talking about our dinner tonight
I’m looking forward to it ALMOST as
much as she is
Fair warning — our girl is ON THE PROWL
(makes a playful clawing gesture)

The two smile and air kiss goodbye as Sarah makes her way back
across the lobby Veronica now next in line at the concierge
desk looks back toward the elevator where she felt the weight
of someone’s stare before her reunion with Sarah — but now only
finds a couple of tweens on iPads

CONCIERGE
How may I help you this morning

The concierge appears to be the same sandy-haired young woman
who was massaging the shoulders of the soldier in the mess hall

VERONICA
Oh right yes Can I make a
reservation for three tonight
730 at Stephano’s
Im in room 713

CONCIERGE
Absolutely right way

VERONICA
Thank you so much
(remembering)
Ohh and isn’t this a non-smoking hotel

CONCIERGE
Yes Ms Henley it is

VERONICA
Well someone didnt get the memo
Last night there was the most pungent
smell of cigar smoke coming from either
an adjacent room or the hallway I’m not
really sure where it originated from
but I’m allergic and

CONCIERGE
(puts her hand up to stop her)
Ms Henley say no more —
I will look into this right away

Veronica satisfied turns to walk away —— we hold on the

concierge’s hands for just a moment before slowly pushing in

The concierge simultaneously picks up the desk phone while
managing to type something on her iPhone We hear the sound
effect of a text message being sent

INT HOTEL HALLWAY

A different pair of strappy Alexander Wang high-heels click
loudly on the marble floor of the hotel hallway skin pale

white showing off perfectly manicured red toes

fingernails hold a phone that just received an incoming text

Matching red

that we can’t see The woman passes by several rooms

We scan

up briefly just enough to notice the woman has stopped and is

standing in front of a door marked “713”

The woman exhales quickly feigning frustration

As we pan

right (still only legs and feet) another woman is standing next

to her with a cart of folded bath towels and bed sheets

wearing all white sneakers and white stockings transparent

enough for us to see her varicose veins We can tell she is a

housekeeper

WOMAN IN STRAPPY HEELS
(turns around to the housekeeper
we only see torso
in a slight Southern accent)
Excuse me puddin

The housekeeper’s feet turn around

WOMAN (CONT)
Ugh I am SO silly
(flustered)

She is

I must have left my key in the room
Is there any way you could let me in
quickly

We scan up enough to see the housekeeper’s hand’s looking at her
clipboard

HOUSEKEEPER
(flat American accent)
713 Ms Henley

INT A BATHROOM

Tight shot of the same strappy high-heels and perfectly
manicured red toes from the hallway are now resting on a tile
floor As we gradually pull out slightly from the strappy
heels we find that a woman is on the commode (never seeing her
face) A faint trickle of water can be heard as she gleefully
taps her foot She finishes closes the lid but does not flush
the toilet

We know this is the same woman from the hallway with the
housekeeper She walks over to the vanity in the oversized
luxurious bathroom and washes her hands (extreme close-up)
before collecting a tube of Chanel lipstick (from a make-up bag
sitting on the counter) and applying it very carefully to her
lips (extreme close-up) She puts the cap back on and places
the tube in her purse Once finished she takes a beautiful
glass perfume bottle and sprays on her wrists (extreme close-up)
before rubbing them together Smelling herself she is clearly
pleased with the scent From behind without revealing her face
we see her adjust her hair in the mirror before exiting the
bathroom

The room is immaculate Clothes are neatly folded papers are
perfectly ordered on the desk — in an almost obsessive
compulsive way The woman looks at the neatly piled clothes and
papers and lightly knocks a sweater off the top of the pile and
moves the papers out of order

The woman makes her way to the hallway door and exits As the
door closes slowly behind her the camera remains stationary for
just a moment before the focus slowly shifts from mid-room to
the wall behind the giant king bed — where we notice Kennedi’s
stick figure drawing she gifted her mommy hanging just above
the headboard

INT HOTEL BALLROOM — DAYTIME

The audience is applauding as Veronica concludes her final
words Behind her is a large screen spotlighting her credentials
along with a photo and the familiar TED Talk logo

Veronica Henley PhD

Sociologist and Best Selling Author

Veronica takes an extended pause We see faces in the audience
nodding and wide-eyed Veronica looks back out at the audience

as she concludes

VERONICA
(we enter mid-sentence)
«Ive been courted by controversy for
saying African Americans are descendants
of kings and queens as much as we are
of slaves — that dichotomy affords us
a unique perspective in both experience
and observation For example as a
black woman in American academia
— by necessity I became expert
at navigating spaces that were
traditionally designated for white
men I would temporarily
compartmentalize those parts of
myself that could potentially be
perceived as threatening or god
forbid “angry” to the patriarchy

VERONICA (CONT)
But eventually I learned that by
embracing my true self not only
would I survive — I would thrive
(clasps her hands and pauses)
I hope that by sharing my own
Coping Persona story people of
all stripes will lean into the full
potential of what is possible when
we are courageous enough to remain
grounded to our most authentic
selves — even within environments
which by design demand our total
and complete assimilation

Rousing applause from the audience turns into a standing
ovation We see the stage from the audience’s perspective
Veronica looks like a star — strong accomplished beautiful

The summit host CAMILLE is looking out at the room as she
interrupts the clapping

CAMILLE
I want to thank Dr Veronica Henley so much
for being here We couldn’t ask for more
(looks toward Veronica while clapping
herself and mouths “thank you”)
(to audience)
It is truly an honor for you to have been
a part of this discussion I can say
for myself that learning more about the
“Coping Persona” has me thinking on how
I can apply that in my own life - and
how I may already have

The audience once again applauds as both Veronica and Camille
exit the stage

INT BACK STAGE — MINUTES LATER

The back-stage is really just a make-shift set-up area a part
of the overall ballroom Veronica is speaking to a PA who is

handing her back her purse and briefcase Camille is speaking to

someone else but sees Veronica putting her finger up indicatin
she needs a quick moment before sidling up next to Veronica

CAMILLE
The way you capture the nuance and

Dawn comes out of nowhere and abruptly interrupts

DAWN
That was just fantastic
I enjoyed my own session but there was
no way I was leaving before this
(now directly to Camille)
Just fantastic Really
Now I don’t mean to be abrupt
but I must steal Vee — important business
(gives a playful wink)

CAMILLE
Oh no worries — I have to finish
up some work and then get right
back to San Fran

g

Dawn ushers Veronica out of there as if a bomb was reported in
the building As soon as they are at a safe distance from the
crowd now in a far corner of the hotel lobby

DAWN
You are welcome
Real talk -- she was angling

to join us for dinner this evening
and I just couldn’t have it

Girl bye

We deserve a little recess from

academia Besides - I only get my

Vee time a few times a year and I need

to be able to be “All Dawn” — no filter
VERONICA

(playfully)

There’s a filter

(slight pause)

So is Sarah locked in a closet
somewhere as well

DAWN
Pssssh
(thinks on it for a moment though)
Of course not No Sarah’s my girl too
(seriously)
The dinner reservation is for 3 and we
should respect the restaurant protocol
don’t you think
(smiles completely aware of her
own ridiculousness)
And so for after dinner I was
thinking that

VERONICA
(Was only half-listening but interrupts)
After dinner After dinner I have a date
with my king bed I cannot watch you
two as you are on the prowl
Me and that king bed — it’s a thing

DAWN
(disappointed but not surprised)
Ok then I get it I get it
Gotta get that me time when you can
The elevator doors open and Veronica walks in and presses her
floor We notice the same rosy-checked little blonde girl from

VERONICA
Plus I have a 6am flight

DAWN
No no no no no —
Do not worry -- I get it

We will keep you fully apprised
via text of every detail

VERONICA
Of this I have no doubt Now let me
head up to this room and get ready

DAWN
Ok meet you down here at 700 —
well Uber together

VERONICA
See you at 7
(presses elevator button)

DAWN
Ooh what you wearin’
Wear somethin’ sexy — we want
all eyes on our table

VERONICA
(reveals smile)
Girl I’m on it

the opening scene lurking in the corner wearing a floor length

ecru and baby blue-colored linsey-woolsey dress
miniaturized southern belle from Gone with the Wind — save for

She is a

the bright pink Nike high-tops peeking out from under the lace

trimming

Veronica moves to press floor “7” but it is already illuminated

The little blonde girl places her index finger over her lips

shushing Veronica

VERONICA
You’re on the 7‘ floor too
sweetie

LITTLE BLONDE GIRL
(stares at Veronica tilting her head
to one side reminiscent of Jasper)
Shhhh
(beat)
You’1l get in trouble for talking

Veronica playing along replies

VERONICA
(loud whisper)
Okay

While disembarking the strange little girl doesn’t break stare
with Veronica — she simply begins skipping down the hallway
without a care in the world We now notice she is holding a
black baby doll by the leg letting it’s head drag along the
hallway floor The stark contrast of the hotel’s ultra-modern
setting makes her appear more ghost than real

VERONICA
(under her breath)
Well allllright then

Veronica exits the elevator making her way to her door and lets
herself in As soon as Veronica moves to enter her room the
little girl is revealed behind her in the distance slightly ou
of focus staring back in that direction a couple doors down

CUT TO BLACK FOR TWO FULL SECONDS
Elevator doors open with a “ding”

While Veronica is always a vision she is now a full-blown
knockout in a knee-length emerald dress tall black strappy
shoes with a delicate black suede jacket draped over her
shoulders In stark contrast to her earlier outfit — now
showing just a little cleavage Not too much — just enough
As she walks out of the elevator we hear a gasp which we are
pretty sure is Dawn who is of course already seated in the
lobby waiting on her girls to arrive

DAWN
(quickly and simply)
Oh oKay okay

Dawn throws her hand up and begins to walk away obviously
happy with how Veronica looks

t

Veronica grins as they begin to walk together
DAWN (CONT)
(playfully to Veronica)
Can we kick it
Sarah enters next to Veronica
VERONICA and SARAH
(collectively)

Yes we can

INT BLACK SUV EN ROUTE TO RESTAURANT

In the car Veronica is seated by the door Dawn in the middle

and Sarah on the other side Veronica has herself positioned so

that she has some privacy while texting Dawn and Sarah are
talking about where they are going later while Veronica texts

Incoming text
Bae 717PM

PHOTO OF KENNEDI IN EQUESTRIAN HELMET
Destined to be a champion just like her mother

Veronica text
HEART EMOJI

Bae text
You in them streets

Veronica text
Yup

Bae text
(texting bubbles as he writes)
You looking sexy

Veronica text
Yup

Bae text
(texting bubbles as he writes)
You got the titties out

Veronica gives a little laugh which shifts Dawn’s attention

DAWN
What Who is that

SARAH
You know it’s Nick

Before Veronica engages with Dawn she types a simple “Yup” with
a kiss emoji While typing Dawn is peeping her screen and lets
out a little shriek

DAWN
See You see
THIS is what I am talking about
THIS is how it’s supposed to be
No jealousy no fear —
On each other’s team
A case study you two
Ugh sickening Just sickening
Where are all the Nicks
Why do they escape me
(drawn out)
Why do you hiiiide

VERONICA
Oh stop

SARAH
Excuse me What is happening

Before Veronica can click her phone off Dawn grabs it playfully
to show to Sarah

SARAH
Oh And here I thought
marital bliss was an oxymoron

She laughs as we see the SUV slow down and can see the entry to
the restaurant outside the window Veronica has her phone back
and is texting

Veronica text
I almost forgot
TY for the flowers emoji babe heart

Nick is texting back as indicated by the animated bubbles The

Uber driver comes around to open the door As Veronica is
getting out of the car Nick responds

Bae text
Huh Would love to take credit
Must be from one of your many admirers

Veronica has a look of confusion on her face and is just about
to text a reply when Dawn rests her hand on Veronica’s shoulder

as they approach the restaurant’s entrance

DAWN
(playfully but for real)
Let’s live in the present girl

Veronica while still confused complies and puts her phone away

as the girls enter the restaurant
INT RESTAURANT — NIGHT
The hostess greets them with a plastered smile at the podium

VERONICA
Henley for three please

HOSTESS
(her name tag reads “Rebecca” )
Yes we have your table follow me

The hostess leads the trio through the half-filled restaurant
the other side near the back She stops at the last table
directly next to the bathroom entrance

HOSTESS (CONT)
Have a lovely dinner

DAWN
(puts her hand up)
No I um No

SARAH
What my friend is trying to Say

DAWN
Oh no — I got this
Excuse me Becky
This is simply unacceptable
But I think you already know that
I’m not going to get into a back
and forth as to why you think this
is ok — but we are taking that table

to

right over there

HOSTESS
I — Um

DAWN
Thank you so much sweetie
(pats her on the shoulder as they
make their way toward the prime
table in the center of the restaurant)
The women settle into their table as the waiter immediately
comes by to introduce himself

WAITER
Good evening — my name is Sam
May I start you ladies off with
a cocktail this evening

Dawn pipes up right away without consulting the table

DAWN
Well take a bottle of champagne
please — we’re celebrating

WAITER

Lovely

(tilts head)

How about a nice bottle of prosecco

Veronica snaps the wine list shut with a purposeful clap

VERONICA

(without looking at the waiter)
Well take a bottle of the
2003 Krug Thank you

INT RESTAURANT — LATER

The restaurant is dimly lit with one small light in the center
of each table There is a sexy vibe in the space and most
patrons match the vibe Veronica Dawn and Sarah are now seated at
a prime table in the middle of the room We enter mid-
conversation
SARAH
(looks to Dawn)
Any app prospects for the evening

DAWN
(exaggeratedly points to Sarah)
I am GLAD you asked
As a matter of fact I have been
setting up a time to meet a
man named Justin
He is dark chocolate of course
(serious )
About 72 Cacao I would say
(animated sings it)
And he has a friiiieeend
(looks to Sarah)

SARAH
And by friend you mean

VERONICA
Awful Probably awful

SARAH
Exactly Horrible

DAWN
No no no no no
I’m sure he is just as fine

SARAH
Waaaait
“T’m sure”
So you mean you haven’t even seen him
Nope This is not a thing that is going
to happen I am too grown

DAWN
Okay okay
(to Sarah)
I don’t have to meet up with
him tonight
Let’s just go have some FUN

VERONICA
(leans in toward the women in a
worried whisper)
Girls did you notice that guy at
the bar he won’t stop looking at us

The waiter arrives at the table
SERVER
Before I take your order I just
wanted to let you know that the
gentleman over there sent this
drink specifically for you
(places drink in front of Dawn)

The women turn their attention toward Dawn’s now familiar
ADMIRER who is looking at their table from under the bar’s

mounted television

On the screen we notice a politician (who

looks eerily similar to HIM) being interviewed on CNN The
chyron reads “Senator Dunn Proposes Bill to Preserve
Confederate Monuments on Federal Lands”

The admirer makes his way over to the table as the server leaves
to let him have his moment The stranger is tall white
svelte clean-cut and quite handsome with a full head of
luxurious black hair and piercing blue eyes

ADMIRER
(to Dawn)
I’ve had my eye on you
(awkward pause clears throat)
I just had to come by to tell you
that I think you are quite stunning

DAWN
Oh well thank you very much
(fans herself)
Might I say that you are quite
fine yourself
(looks at the drink — becomes serious)
HOWEVER -- I think I would be doing
you a disservice if I did not help
you to critique your game

Veronica and Sarah become visibly awkward shifting in their
chairs unable to look directly at the situation but we can
tell that this has happened before

DAWN (CONT)
First thank you for the drink
Second you are fine as hell and
because of that you are forgiven
HOWEVER I think you could see from across
the room that we are drinking champagne
I am a champagne lady
We are champagne women

While the gesture is very much welcomed
a vodka cranberry shows a lack of
appreciation of the situation

ADMIERER looks around uncomfortably The other women are equally
as uncomfortable

Veronica glances a few tables over and spots a WOMAN facing the
opposite direction ordering from the waiter We notice her long
strawberry-blonde hair distracting Veronica from the interaction
happening at her own table

We enter back into Dawn’s conversation

DAWN (CONT)
Further You see I am here with
these lovely ladies Did you
intend to have them feel left out
(let’s the pause linger)
Here is what should have happened
Ask our server what type of champagne
we are drinking
Send us another bottle of that
Make eye contact with me from across
the room
Hell maybe even a little eye fuck
(demonstrates )
Then then make your way over and
introduce yourself

The admirer is growing increasingly deflated and uncomfortable

DAWN (CONT)
I say all of that to say this
(pause)
Here is my card
(hands him her card which she had ready)
Thank you for the drink - I like you
You are quite fine This CAN happen
But not tonight -- Text me

Slightly confused but happy the admirer slowly makes his way
back to the table as all the women watch

Veronica shifts her focus back to the woman a few tables away

The woman turns her head as she laughs with her tablemate
inadvertently making eye contact with Veronica It is not

Elizabeth Veronica breathes a sigh of relief and brings her
attention back to her own table

Veronica and Sarah share a look with each other and then back
toward Dawn
DAWN
What He needed to know

SARAH
Can we all just take a moment to
acknowledge that he was
supernaturally FINE

Veronica and Sarah once again share a look

DAWN
What
(gets what they are thinking)
No

(shaking head)

Emmm Emmmm

Racial clap Bias clap
Don’t do it

Still not fully buying it Veronica and Sarah acquiesce

SARAH
Ok ok

VERONICA
No you’re right You’re right

Dawn basks in her own righteousness for a moment

DAWN
he couldn’t resist all this
(wiggles in her chair)
I mean you don’t know we could
have shared several lifetimes together
and he just felt that connection
I do leave quite an impression you know

SARAH
Well not to put my academia hat
on too tightly but humans experience
time as linear but in actuality
the past present and future are all
taking place simultaneouslLy

DAWN
Oh I see so what you’re saying is
that boo and I are together RIGHT NOW

HARD CUT TIME PASSES

DAWN
(mid-sentence)
«and you know I don’t discriminate
JDate Christian Mingle Black Planet
all accounts are fully active

Veronica and Sara smirk before the busser comes by to clear some
final plates from the table and Dawn takes the last sip from her
champagne glass

VERONICA
(giving up she pushes her seat out)
Well I very much look forward
to keeping up with this saga on a
group chat from my bed
(beat)
Although everything has just been so off
with this hotel — housekeeping didnt
even clean my room today
Not holding my breath for turn down service

SARAH
Ugh that’s weird — everything has
been so great with my room

Veronica gives an almost inaudible “humph” to herself as she
rises from the table and collects her purse

DAWN
Um excuse me
I know we are all beautiful as
Hell but I think that we
might still have to pay
Good looks notwithstanding

VERONICA
Taken care of Let’s go

DAWN

OOOHHH See Do you see that
Thank you my classy lady

SARAH
Vee — you didn’t have to do that
Thank you so much for dinner
(pause)
Are you SURE you can’t keep this going

VERONICA
(tilts head)
Anything for my favorites
except proceeding to the next venue
(presses button on her phone)
My uber is en route

All the women get up from the table We see Sarah ordering an
Uber for herself and Dawn The woman from a few tables away is
now headed straight for Veronica

WOMAN
(apologetic gesture)
I am so sorry to do this but
I just had to tell you that your
book changed my life —
my whole perspective
(beat)
I apologize if I was staring at you
earlier I just — I just had
to come up and say thank you

VERONICA
Oh no apology necessary at all
Thank you so much I really
appreciate that
I’m so happy to hear that it had
such a positive influence for you

WOMAN
Ugh it really did
(putting her hand out apologetically
realizing she didn’t introduce herself
properly)
I just had to meet you
I’1ll let you get back to your night

VERONICA
It’s so nice to meet you
Thank you again

Veronica returns to Dawn and Sarah who apparently are used to this
as they don’t react As they all walk out Dawn makes sure to
make eye-contact with the man from earlier giving him a little
air kiss as she exits Next to the gentleman from earlier we
briefly notice another man at the bar who strongly resembles one
of the corporals from the mess hall

The women crowd under the small awning as it has begun to rain

DAWN
OOH — almost forgot
(scrambles for phone)
Let’s get a cute little
selfie real quick

Veronica rifles through her purse and mumbles under her breath
“where’s my lipstick” Frustrated she gives up

The three women bring their faces together and Dawn extends her
arm After several snaps they immediately look at the screen

DAWN
One-take wonders
All of us 1’11 tag everybody

The women both give their sign of approval on the photo as a
large black SUV pulls up to the curb and the window cracks open

We hear the driver call “Veronica”

VERONICA
(raises her hand to let the
driver know she heard her as
she says goodbye to Dawn and Sarah)
Okay my beauties ‘til next time

Even crowded under the awning they perform their departure
ritual of over-emphasized air kisses before Veronica sprints to

the car gives a little wave and quickly shuts the door

INT VERONICA’S UBER

VERONICA
(to the driver)
The Four Seasons please I put it in

(Depeche Mode is playing at a clearly
inappropriate level)
Also can you turn that down a tick

Veronica opens her texts and replies to Nick’s last message

VERONICA’S TEXT
Dinner was fantastic Girls say hey
Text you in the AM from the airport

As soon as the text goes through a new text pops up from Sarah
in their group chat The music has not been turned down

SARAH TEXT
She is already flirting with the driver
of course Thank you again for dinner

INT DAWN and SARAH’S UBER

Sarah is finishing her text while we enter mid-conversation
between Dawn and the driver

DAWN
«SO you know ahead of time
We are five star’ers
And it looks like you might just
be as well
(gives a little wink)
«but well see
(interrupts herself)
Ohh Turn that up Turn That Up

Maxwell’s “Ascension” is playing low in the background before
the volume increases sharply Sarah immediately puts her phone
down and the two women begin harmonizing

INT VERONICA’S UBER

VERONICA TEXT
Love you both I’1l

Just then her phone starts to ring with an incoming 415 number
interrupting her text message Veronica presses “accept” The
volume is still at an inappropriately high level as she answers
the phone and it’s hard to hear

VERONICA
Yes

CALLER
Veronica

VERONICA
Hello
Yes who is this

INT DAWN and SAHRA’S UBER

The two women are fully enjoying themselves and just about to get
to the chorus of the song
DAWN
(to the driver)
Danny this your part right here
THIS YOUR PART

The trio begin singing in unison

SARAH
For real — this my shit right here

Dawn puts her hand up to let Sarah know that this is a full-on
performance — no commentary She gets it and joins back in as we

INT VERONICA’S UBER

Music still blaring

VERONICA
(to person on phone)
Sorry I’m having difficulty hearing
(to drive)
Can you PLEASE turn that down
(back to person on phone)
Who is this

CALLER
This is Chet your Uber driver
I’m outside the restaurant
whenever you’re ready

VERONICA
(confused)
No no I think there is a mistake
I’m in my Uber now
(looks to the driver)
Ma’am

Music still blaring the driver does not turn around or
acknowledge Veronica at all

INT DAWN and SARAH’S UBER

The song continues as Dawn and Sarah are swaying in unison — the
driver peeks back at them in the rear-view and begins to sway
with them

INT VERONICA’S UBER

VERONICA
(to driver)
Excuse me Ma’am
I think there was a mix-up
(beat)
Can you turn that down

The driver ignores her

VERONICA (CONT)
(now agitated)
Hello

The woman in the driver’s seat moves her head to look back at
Veronica in the rear-view mirror pushing her long strawberry-
blonde hair out of her face and applying Veronica’s tangerine
Chanel lipstick — it is Elizabeth

DRIVER
Mmmm Turns out this color does
look good on me

Just as we make this connection we see a hand emerge from the
pitch black of the third-row seat behind Veronica The man
violently pulls back Veronica’s head We immediately notice his
hand is missing a ring finger -- it is Jasper

Veronica screams through Jasper’s hand It moves just enough for
us to hear her above the raging music

VERONICA (CONT)
(muffled scream through his hands)
Wha mmmmmmmm — hmmmmmmmph

EXT VERONICA’S UBER
Veronica’s black Uber SUV is barreling down the two-lane street
She is desperately slapping her hands against the rear passenger

window fighting for dear life to get someone anyone’s
attention Just then a second almost identical SUV pulls up

alongside Veronica’s Uber and slowly passes — it’s Dawn and
Sarah Their windows are down we hear the music blaring as
they continue singing at the top of their lungs passing
Veronica’s SUV completely clueless Veronica can see Dawn and
Sarah as their windows are down but they cannot see her through
her SUV tints

INT VERONICA’S SUV

We see a smug expression come across Elizabeth’s face via the
rear-view mirror Veronica is in a full panic with her arms and
legs flailing and kicking trying to break free of Jasper’s
grip She smashes her high heel into the front seat with every
bit of her strength losing her shoe in the struggle nearly
kicking Elizabeth in the jaw but misses

It is no use Jasper tries unsuccessfully to force a cloth over
Veronica’s mouth as she continues to fight him off with every
ounce of her strength

ELIZABETH
We don’t have time for this
stop being such a god damn
snowflake and handle her

Jasper takes Elizabeth’s instruction and suddenly grabs the side
of Veronica’s head and slams it against the side door with such
force blood splatters from her mouth and nose before her eyes
go white Veronica is knocked out cold and slinks into a
horizontal position across the back seat Her phone falls from
the seat onto the floor It lights up as we see a text from
Sarah

NICK TEXT
photo of Kennedi smiling in her bedroom
giving her mom a kissy face
Her pajama top reads a sparkly
“Black Girl Magic”

As we pan back up we see Elizabeth’s eyes mesmerized taking it
all in from the rear-view she gives Jasper an approving smirk

Screen abruptly cuts to black

CUT TO
INT VERONICA’S CABIN — LATE NIGHT
The same iPhone continues to ring
Veronica’s eyes shoot open in the pitch dark

Startled and without a stitch of clothing HIM jumps up from the
bed and races outside to the source of the man-made chirping
Veronica waits for just a moment before making her way to the
window quietly so as to go undetected

HIM has managed to harvest the device from Daphne’s saddle bag

HIM
What the hell It’s 3AM

There is silence as HIM is intensely listening to what the
caller is saying on the other end — we cannot hear them

HIM (CONT)
Emm-hmm
Well what did you say
(silence deep sigh)
It’s under control
(silence he is listening)
I SAID I will handle it —
she is gone

We see Veronica still at the window listening to the one-sided
conversation

HIM (CONT)

(frustrated)

If I see her pathetic husband

on the news one more time

(convincingly)

Yes understood It’s handled
Him hangs up the phone abruptly and pauses looking up toward
the night sky before heading back in Veronica quickly shakes
herself out of the daze from what she just heard and runs as
fast she can back to bed

Him re-enters the cabin The floor creaking with every step

HIM (CONT)
(whispers loudly)
Eden

Veronica does not respond

HIM (CONT)
(again slightly louder)
EDEN

Nothing Him then softly caresses Eden’s head

HIM (CONT)
(in a whisper)
I’ve so enjoyed our time together

Tight on Eden’s face we see her doing the best she can to
contain the terror and convincingly feign sleep

HIM satisfied moves to the far side of the room As he does
Veronica peeks her eyes open for only a moment HIM sits in the
chair — it creaks and moans as he leans back and lights a cigar

The smoke makes its way over to Veronica’s face She does her
best struggling to stifle a cough

She can feel his eyes on her — boring into her She will not
sleep the rest of the night

INT CABIN -- THE NEXT MORNING

Veronica struggles to keep her balance as she dozes off ina
corner standing listless and terrified — awaiting further
instruction from Him The kettle squeals whistling Veronica to
attention Him’s raspy voice echoes out from the shadows

HIM
Not too hot girl - and no cream
My flask is right sittin’ on the table
«give me just a shot in the cup

Veronica grips the kettle handle as if it were a weapon
watching the pot scream as the scalding steam gushes from the
spout But she thinks better of it shaking off any fantasy she
may have in the moment and instead spikes Him’s tea as
instructed

HIM (CONT)
I’m heading out
Got some business to handle
Politics never sleeps
But don’t worry Ill be
right back here tonight
(pauses touching her face)
Let’s make it a special evening

Trembling in fear Veronica lifts up the cup of tea handing it
to Him without a word HIM takes a generous portion of
Veronica’s backside sullying her already soiled dress with his
soot-covered hands

Veronica moves quickly to stand in the entryway of the cabin as
HIM collects his things from inside

Looking over to Veronica while preparing Daphne’s saddle

HIM
See you tonight
(pause)
get a bath

A chill runs down Veronica’s spine HIM then collects his dragon
saber and mounts Daphne Veronica watches HIM turn into a small
dot as he makes his way past the cotton fields into the
nothingness She re-enters the cabin and sits on the edge of
the bed Clearly anxious she stares out the tiny cabin window
contemplative — mind racing — tonight Veronica knows that she
will escape or die trying

Then suddenly a loud rap at the door Veronica almost jumps out
of her skin

It’s just Eli

ELI
(loud whisper from other side of door)
Gon be late for this bullshit you ready

Veronica ordinarily sedate rushes to the door and begins her
walk down to the fields with Eli Just as she is about to utter
the news she notices Eli is walking with a limp and appears to
wince in pain with each step We notice a rip in the back of
Eli’s shirt revealing what appears to be a “Q Dog” fraternity
brand on his left shoulder

VERONICA
We leave tonight

ELI
What

VERONICA (CONT)
(takes a beat)
We go tonight

ELI
Tonight
(emphasizes his limp)
I can’t

They continue down cabin row when Veronica is just about to
share the news of HIM’s disturbing late night phone
conversation The opportunity is lost when suddenly an overseer
appears within earshot gun pointed directly at their backs

EXT PLANTATION — DAY

A frost is already on the ground from the first cold snap Eli
and Veronica settle into the field and begin their work
alongside the rest of the “slaves” Veronica cups her freezing
hands over her mouth trying to ward off the bitter cold

JASPER
(stern)
What I say

Veronica Eli and the others look up toward Jasper — not knowing
quite how to respond

Jasper tilts his head — waiting

JASPER
What the FUCK did I say Julia
I told that girl YESTERDAY she
got one pass
Now she thinks she can come
to the fields whenever she
damn well pleases
She will learn her lesson today
(looks toward Veronica)
Go fetch her

Veronica is frozen for a moment

ELI
I can head up there sir

Jasper spits a wad of snuff collecting in his jaw down at the
ground next to Eli’s foot

JASPER
Who gave you permission to
speak boy

Jasper looks around toward the other Confederates on horseback
as they all shake their heads Veronica locks eyes with Eli as
if begging him to stay quiet

ELI
(under his breath to himself)
I gave MYSELF permission to speak

JASPER
(turning his attention back to Eden)
Right now girl Get

Veronica nods and begins to make her way before Jasper yells

JASPER (CONT)
With some pep in your step girl

Veronica begins a jog straight toward cabin row somewhat
visible from their position in the field

JASPER (CONT)
No fucking sense of urgency
round here
All of ya Back to work
(looks to a male slave)
You boy — fetch me that basket
over there
(motions toward the cotton
basket maybe 20 yards way)

We wait and watch as the male slave complies and retrieves the
basket dropping it then at Jasper’s feet

MALE SLAVE
Here you are
(sarcastically)
Sir

(stares back at Jasper as if he could
murder him with his bare hands — tears
of hatred welling in his eyes)

Jasper gives it one hard kick from the saddle knocking over the
entire basket Atop his palomino he grins down at the male
slave

JASPER
Pick that shit up
(turns away still grinning)

The male slave then turns back toward Jasper taking an
aggressive stance ready to throw him off his horse and beat the
shit out of him

The tip of a rifle suddenly appears at the slave’s back The
other overseer is directly behind him

OVERSEER
Don’t even think about it boy

EXT CABIN ROW MOMENTS LATER

Veronica continues her run toward the cabin — sweat and worry on
her face

She begins to slow down as she approaches cabin row Julia’s
cabin is just ahead When she reaches cabin 2 the door is
ajar and Veronica gives it a soft knock

VERONICA
Julia You in there
(knocks harder)
Julia

Veronica presses the door gently just above the knob and it
gradually swings open Veronica’s face is overcome with horror
and repulsion

Julia’s legs sway in mid-air spinning slowly Her exposed ankle
reveals not a birthmark but a small heart symbol tattoo As we
tilt upward we see her neck is broken head sideways eyes
open The blank stare indicates her spirit only recently vacated
her now-lifeless body

Veronica slaps her own mouth closed as the sound of the roped
bed sheet stressing the wood becomes too much to bear and for

the first time Veronica is unable to stave off a visible display
of emotion

Veronica rushes over to Julia in a desperate attempt to prop
her up in futility

Veronica collapses to her knees

As Veronica holds Julia’s body in the distance we hear a whip
cracking the air and the unmistakable sound of the cat o’ nine
tails slashing skin to the bone The look of despair on
Veronica’s face is replaced with a mix of terror and seething
anger

FADE TO WHITE
DREAM SEQUENCE (CONT FROM FIRST DREAM SEQUENCE)

Kennedis long loose curls fall onto Veronicas shoulders as
she holds her super tight covering her tiny mouth to keep her
from giving away their location Suddenly the blanket is ripped
away revealing they were never hiding from anything sinister
but instead Nick who is playing hide and seek and finds them
before giving chase to Kennedi Veronica falls behind and we
notice a look of awe as she stares toward her beautiful
innocent little girl

FADE TO WHITE
EXT COTTON FIELDS — LATER THAT AFTERNOON

We pull out on Veronica’s stoic face we can see the pores on
her skin and the beads of sweat gathering on the crevice of her
lip She is staring into the nothingness Behind her smoke
billows from the burn shed in the background as we see the
guards on patrol along the perimeter Some don rifles while
others brandish semi-automatic weapons

The slaves continue to cultivate the frozen soil by hand — for
the sole purpose of stage craft — when once again they train
their sights on the thunderous sound overhead We finally learn
the source of their fascination is a passing commercial jet All
the slaves stare — except for Veronica She knows what it is
She doesn’t need to see it again— her eyes are locked on the
burn shed

The airliner flying above feels like an insult at this point In
the distance Elizabeth fitted in a southern belle dress

tracks the plane as it races across the sky before taking a
deep breath as she surveys the entire plantation with a sense
of pride — holding her daughter’s hand

Jasper reprimands them back to “picking cotton” before he and a
gaggle of his men head out to patrol the parameter We can hear
rumblings of that “great battle” in the distance as Eli comes
back to join them limping and wincing in pain

Jasper mounted on his horse slowly trots toward Veronica

JASPER
(breaks a hard silence)
Eden You’re not looking your best

Veronica looks at him puzzled as if thinking “of course I don’t
look my fucking best you fucking simpleton” but says nothing

JASPER (CONT)
I suspect The General will want you
a bit more presentable this evening
(gives her a wink)
Finish this row and get your
sorry ass to the cabin

Veronica doesn’t mouth a word but nods her head in recognition
of the instruction from Jasper

Jasper moves on leaving Veronica and Eli alone Veronica takes
full survey of the land as she digs in the hard earth with her
hands She appears to be studying the wooded area that is the
break between the cotton fields and the nothingness — where she
so often hears the sound of cannons and gunfire

VERONICA
(Looking straight ahead without so
much as a glance Eli’s way)
Tonight

This gets Eli’s attention

VERONICA (CONT)
(restrained defiance in a loud
whisper barely covers the alarm
and urgency in Veronica’s voice —
she now looks directly at Eli)

We go tonight

Eli swiftly turns to Veronica whose terrified eyes are trained
on him with a long defiant stare adding further weight to her
declaration Eli now senses they are in IMMINENT danger —

Veronica then turns her head away from Eli pretending to work

As Veronica walks away we hear Eli’s signature whistle —
GAME ON

INT VERONICA’S CABIN - GLOAMING

Veronica takes the orange jar of “Murray’s pomade” and looks at
the cover with the famous afro’d couple on the lid She takes a
generous portion in her hands to lay down her edges just so
She catches her reflection in the looking glass and closes her
eyes for just a moment

Veronica makes her way to the front window of the cabin The
Confederate flag flies above as caravans of tiki torches in the
distance signaling the Confederates are making their way to the
plantation for the night

Veronica runs to check herself in the looking glass knowing that
Him will be among the cavalry She then returns to practicing
the now familiar invisible hopscotch dance before making her way
to the door The floor still creaks slightly — she hasn’t
perfected her route

INT VERONICA’S CABIN — LATER

We only see the bottom of Him’s size 12 boots sitting next to
his Confederate-issued dragon saber Veronica is laying at the
foot of the bed on top of Him’s bare feet like a cat as
instructed

The cabin is cold and the furnace serves as both the cabin’s
only light source and heat

HIM
What did you do while I was gone

Veronica says nothing but instead adjusts her body in
acknowledgement of the question

HIM

That’s good Eden
Nice and quiet

HIM gets up from the bed it is pitch dark save for the
moonlight cascading through the window The red coal from the
end of a cigar is the only indication of where he is located in
the room

HIM torments Veronica with a long drag from his cigar and lets
it swirl for a moment before continuing

HIM (CONT)
I was the antidote Eden —
I broke the fever When I found you
stricken by that poison flailing all
around on television I knew I had to
stop you I had to head off the spread

HIM shadowed in silhouette puts out his cigar and gets back
into bed pulling Veronica up to his big body

Veronica rolls over to her side anxious eyes wide open Him
situates himself as Veronica waits patiently for his eyes to
close for the night signaled by his heavy labored breathing

HIM is asleep

Veronica puts her hand on his face — nothing She gives hima
nudge in his side but no nothing Him is dead asleep

It is time

Veronica begins the process of carefully climbing over his big
body to reach the floor on the other side of the bed First her
leg then her arm then her other leg contorting her body not
unlike moves we saw in her yoga practice She is just about
over HIM to the other side of the bed slowly lowering her feet
onto the ground light as a feather when HIM suddenly lets out
a loud snore startling Veronica causing her to lose her
balance and fall to the floor

Completely still she remains on the floor waiting to hear his
voice — but nothing only a small subsequent snore

Veronica looks up toward the spot on the wall next to the bed
where she had been rubbing her fingers previously almost like a
touchstone

As we pull out we can now see that it is a carving etched into
the wall exactly like that of the picture Kennedi drew before
Veronica left that fateful day

Veronica reaches up once more rubbing her finger against the
smallest stick figure squeezing her eyes closed before taking
one final look — steeling herself for the difficult mission
ahead

VERONICA
(in a whisper)
Ken-Ken

By saying Kennedi’s name and through her defiant expression we
realize Veronica’s coping persona has been shed

When she re-opens her eyes Veronica steals one last look at the
carving looks around the room and takes an ever-so-quiet deep
breath before slowly rising to her feet

We can see HIM sleeping — unbothered by her fall

Wearing an oversized stained night shirt Veronica slowly
presses her feet against the selected wood planks as practiced
— making her way toward the front door masterfully avoiding the
creaky floor planks that are burned into her memory Her
movements are slow meticulous and patient She considers for a
moment veering off course to collect HIM’s dragon sabor leaned
close to his side but decides against it Her caution pays off
as she finally makes it to the door which opens without a sound
— courtesy of her makeshift butter lubricant

The rude cold immediately gives her a shiver and a few flakes of
snow fall into the room She quickly and quietly closes the
door so the cold does not disturb Him’s slumber

Greeting Veronica outside only the sound of crickets and other
nighttime creatures — shadowed by the full moon illuminating
the fields like a giant flashlight — but no Eli

Veronica looks both directions panicked and terrified — with
only Daphne’s breath dissolving like smoke plumes to give her
comfort

She walks over to the side of the cabin and looks around the
corner but only the perimeter guards in the distance at the
edge of the woods are within view — no Eli

The odd falling snow creates an otherworldly silence over the
entire plantation Veronica stares at Daphne for a moment as if
she is magic

She turns back to the cabin door knowing that she cannot risk
being outside of the cabin much longer without risking Him
waking up

MUSIC BEGINS TO BUILD

Suddenly out from the darkness very faint very low we hear
Eli’s trademark whistle While soft it now goes on long enough
for us to easily identify it as Kanye West’s “Power”

We now recognize that Eli has been whistling “Power” this whole
time Eli steps out from the dark ax in hand

Veronica and Eli share a stare We collectively sigh
Veronica smiles for the first time

ELI
(loud whisper)
You ready

VERONICA
mmm-hmm

ELI
Let’s go home

VERONICA
WAIT
(Veronica opens Daphne’s saddle bag)

Eli leans his ax on the side of the cabin as Veronica rifles
through the saddle bag half expecting it not to be in there
until she feels it in her hand and a grin comes across her face
She pulls the phone out and holds it in her hand almost in
disbelief After all this time it looks both familiar and
alien Eli looks on — stunned

ELI
(whispered in disbelief)
I’1l be damned

Veronica presses her finger to the screen to wake the sleeping
phone The phone automatically attempts to sign in using
Veronica’s face

IPHONE SCREEN
Face Not Detected
Enter PIN

The screen gives the option to put in the physical password or
press “Emergency” or “Cancel”

Eli nudges her and she presses “Emergency” which populates a
screen with a keypad Veronica presses “9” then just before she
can press the following two digits

Suddenly there is a distant laughing followed by faint
reflections of torches on the side of the cabin It is the two
young corporals from the mess hall and Julia’s cabin — Daniel
and Purcell obviously intoxicated making their way back to the
main house

Startled Veronica and Eli stumble to find a place to hide on
the side of the cabin As they move the phone drops out of
Veronica’s hand There is no time they have to get out of view
of the corporals The phone lays next on the ground about 10
feet from Daphne as the corporals walk straight toward it as
they make their way past the cabin

As they approach Daniel trips and falls His face lands not
even a foot from HIM’s phone

PURCELL
(to the other laughing)
Dumb ass

As Purcell reaches his hand down to help the other up the phone
is in plain view they are going to spot it

Just then Daphne lets out a snort and a nicker and taps her
back hoof against the ground as if she is annoyed by this whole
interruption This noise spooks both young men who raise their
heads to look at Daphne as they get up missing the phone lying
on the ground right next to them

As they move forward Purcell inadvertently kicks the phone with
his foot It has been discovered

PURCELL
Dude what the hell
(looks down)
Is this yours
(picks up the device and shows Daniel)

DANIEL
PURCELL
No You know the rules
NO CELLPHONES
(repeats the rule under his breath
as he struggles to keep his balance)

No cellphones

PURCELL
Fucking cuck

Purcell throws his beer bottle at Daniel which smashes at his
feet

PURCELL (CONT)
Don’t say my fucking name out here DANIEL
You know that rule too
(snatches phone)
Ill give it to one of the
“Overseers” at the house
(places the cellphone in his
jacket pocket)

The two corporals stumble on right past Veronica and Eli who
are hiding in the shadows

Eli waits for a moment and then motions for Veronica to follow
There is only one chance and it is too late to turn back now

They begin tracking the young corporals through the cotton
fields careful to remain in shadow We can now see light
illuminating from the great house in the distance

Veronica’s bare foot lands on the tip of a broken beer bottle
she winces in pain and lets out a faint cry almost falling to
the ground Although she rebounds quickly the corporals have

heard something

Veronica and Eli lay flat on the ground faces in the dirt
deadly still The corporals turn back toward Veronica and Eli to
investigate

DANIEL
What was that

PURCELL
Came from that direction

Purcell pushes in front to get a better look They both stand
in silence eyes combing the brush It is pitch dark Veronica
and Eli are unable to make out how close the Confederates are to
their hiding spot

The standoff goes on for what seems like an eternity Then
suddenly from the dead of night we see a bright fluorescent
blue light illuminate from the end of a Juul — as Daniel takes a
long exaggerated drag

Veronica and Eli’s faces are covered in earth and sweat
Veronica’s expression is a mix of determination and terror
Eli’s body language demonstrates that he is about to make a
move Veronica squeezes Eli’s hand and whispers “hold tight”

Purcell comes back around the side of Daniel and stealthily rips
the e-cigarette from him

DANIEL
Fuck Scared the shit out of me

PURCELL
Aww what is it
The spooks got you spooked
It’s nothing man No one out
here but us this time of night
(looks around taking in the silence
of the night)

DANIEL
I’m about to piss myself
Can’t stain this new uniform
Gonna take a leak

PURCELL
Fuck that I ain’t waitin
the night is still young
Just meet me at the house

DANIEL
Fine
(laughs )
traitor
(mumbles inaudibly to himself)

Purcell begins to make his way north to the house while Daniel
walks a few paces further into the cotton field close to the

edge of the woods

Leaning his bayonet against an old pine tree he unfastens his
Confederate uniform trousers to relieve himself

We hear a rustling a few feet away from behind DANIEL

DANIEL
Purcell stop fucking around
Ill be up in a sec

MAN’S VOICE
(loud whisper from behind Daniel)
Daniel

Daniel immediately turns around to find Eli starring directly at
him like a rabid dog

Eli wastes no time and slashes him across the neck with the
corporal’s own bayonet Blood spews everywhere as the young
corporal collapses — completely stunned

He is dead

ELI
Get the damn phone

VERONICA
(rustling in Purcell’s pocket
as Eli keeps a lookout)
Got it

There is now no time to waste Veronica touches the screen and
the glow illuminates both their faces She dials 9 —1 —l

Nothing

No bars

There is no signal

ELI
(in the loudest whisper possible)
FUUUCCCKK

VERONICA
I know there is service at the cabin
(thinking on it)
But let’s just go
(grabs Eli’s hand)

ELI
(sternly)
NO
We have to go to the cabin first
We HAVE to
(looks Veronica directly in the eye)
IF we don’t make it

The world HAS to find out about this place
It has to end tonight

Veronica nods in agreement as they begin to make their way back
toward the cabin The night is deadly silent and snow begins to
fall

They arrive back at the cabin give each other a quick glance
before Veronica immediately dials 9-1-1 via the emergency
option there is only one bar going in and out on the screen

A scratchy ring is audible Then another then another before

OPERATOR
9-1-1
(interferencestatic)
What’s your emergency”

Veronica is unable to muster the words and sits in silence
Eli bumps her shoulder

The operator asks again Again the operator’s words are
static-y and muffled — reception is bad

OPERATOR
9-1-1 What’s your emergency”

VERONICA
(in a barely audible whisper)
My name is Veronica Henley

OPERATOR
9-1-1
(static)
What is your emergency

VERONICA
(desperate)
My name is
Veronica Henley
I have been kidnapped
Send help — there are others

The call drops

VERONICA
(desperate to Eli)
We have to unlock the phone
We need to send our location

They both know what this means They need HIM’s face Knowing
they have no time to spare Veronica and Eli move toward the
door of the cabin Eli slowly picks up the ax he left leaned on
the side of the cabin Veronica slowly turns the knob and
presses the door slowly taking a step inside

Almost immediately Veronica is kicked so hard she falls back
off her feet It is HIM and he is madder than ten snakes HIM
strikes Eli with the dragon saber

Eli is down on the ground Incapacitated
Him climbs on top of Eli They share a stare

Him has his hands around Eli’s neck slowly choking the life out
of him We see Eli grasp for anything The ax is just out of
his reach as he stretches and contorts himself to grab for it
But it is no use Him has Eli Eli begins to fade in Him’s
hands

Just then Him screams out in pain Veronica has a hold of the
ax and is on her knees with just enough leverage to chop at
Him’s shins

Him turns around and throws his whole body on top of Veronica
who is unprepared and unable to get out of his way She is
completely smothered by him Her hands frantically swatting at
his face to no avail

Him’s right arm swings upward having all the momentum necessary
to knock the life out of Veronica

Before he can take his swing Eli’s hand grab’s Him’s wrist
holding him back — giving Veronica just enough time to regain
her breath

Him immediately grabs the ax with his left hand laying next to
Veronica and comes at Eli from the opposite direction landing
the ax square in his stomach

Eli looks down at his stomach as Him unsatisfied with this
blow pulls the ax out of Eli’s stomach as blood pours out and
before Veronica can get to them Him lands another blow This
time to Eli’s chest

In an instant Eli is no more

Him pushes the ax in further and jerks it around before pulling
it back out — making sure Eli is dead We see the necklace
dangling around Eli’s neck — the one from the burn shed — as he
stares straight ahead and takes his final gasp

Him then swings his arm by Veronica’s leg knocking her to the
floor once again She scrambles to get out of the cabin
falling and stumbling She makes it out — her face landing in
the dusting of snow on the front porch She attempts to get
back up but falls back down from the slick snow

HIM is back and with a sudden movement and on top of Veronica
With his bare hands (all the while making primal mumbling and
grunting sounds) he begins to choke the life out of Veronica
her veins protruding from her forehead She swats and slaps
desperately trying to get out from under his grip But it is
no use HIM has control Eli is dead No one is coming for
her This is the end

HIM releases his hold from Veronica’s neck as the picture fades
in and out of a fuzzy vignette HIM’s back now faces Veronica
as he then steps over toward Eli We only see flashes — in and
out When we come back in we see Veronica being dragged across
the floor toward the door by HIM

HIM
(mumbling)
I told you
Next time I would take you
to the burn shed myself

Veronica is dragged a few more feet before we hear a loud
strained gasp for air Veronica swings her foot upward with all
her body weight behind it landing her knee just between HIM’s
thighs relegating him to the ground once again

Veronica wastes no time jumping on top of HIM She straddles
his chest reaching down toward his face and violently begins to
gouge his eyes with her fingernails appearing to almost pull
HIM’s eyeballs out of the sockets HIM is wailing in agonizing
pain as he struggles to get her off getting to his knees and
then on his feet Veronica wraps herself around HIM’s entire
big body squeezing his torso like a boa constrictor as HIM
violently swings to and fro HIM finally manages to slam
Veronicas back several times against the wall knocking her
head so hard she releases her hold and slinks to the ground HIM
then tries to regain control but it’s too late Veronica has

made her way out of the doorway in front of the cabin and is
headed in Daphne’s direction

HIM
(yelling)
No fucking loyalty
(now breathless)
Should’ve killed you a long time ago

Him hobbles on one leg behind Veronica ax in hand

HIM (CONT)
Where do you think you’re going
Ain’t nothing for miles

Him raises the ax as he makes his way toward her

HIM (CONT)
You’re not going anywhere
You hear me Eden

Just then as he approaches the corner of the cabin toward
Daphne’s direction Him’s own dragon saber comes from around the
corner and is driven straight through his stomach

VERONICA
(without raising her voice as much
as an octave almost in a whisper)
My name is Veronica
«you Sick bastard

HIM falls to the ground as Veronica lands on top of him from
the momentum She pulls the saber out from his stomach and
begins slicing his body over and over unable to stop but
careful not to touch his face She quickly reaches for the rope
next to Daphne and hog ties HIM

She is possessed and shoves HIM down into the dirt — completely
exhausted Drenched in blood and trembling — the sky is slowly
getting brighter as morning gradually approaches

Veronica then looks to her right and sees Eli lying in the
doorway and rushes over

Tears stream down her face now mixing with blood
VERONICA

Sean Sean
Get up

Tears well up in her eyes as she realizes that Sean (Eli) is
dead She holds his face in her hands A tear from her eye
falls on Seans face

But she will have to mourn another day - time is of the essence

Veronica gets up Retrieving the phone which lays on the ground
next to Eli’s face she rushes back outside next to Him who is
now barely even able to cough up any more blood Practically
dead

HIM is slowly moving his body like a slug on the ground
Veronica steps on his chest bends down and grabs his hair
pulling his head against the ground and yanks the handkerchief
out of his pocket and begins cleaning the blood from Him’s face
with a patient hand

VERONICA
Look at the screen motherfucker

HIM barely flinches Veronica losing patience slaps HIM
across the face with the full weight of her body

VERONICA (CONT)
Look at it
Open your fucking eyes

Veronica enraged once again slaps HIM across the face HIM
finally opens his eyes ever so slowly with a look of absolute
disdain Veronica holds the phone to his face HIM’S eyes
blink and the screen is unlocked

Veronica begins to walk away but pauses turns back walks up
to HIM and elbows him across the face so hard he loses a tooth

She turns her attention to the phone quickly dialing before
pressing it against her ear

This time we hear Nick on the other end

NICK
Hello

VERONICA
Nick
(static)

We now hear Kennedi screaming “MOMMY” at the top

the background

The call drops

NICK

VERONICA

NICK

VERONICA
I — I don’t know I am getting out

VERONICA

I’m sending you a pin

NICK
Vv v Oh my god

VERONICA
I love you I love Kennedi

viv

VERONICA
No

of her lungs in

Veronica looks at the phone and sends a text with her location —

she waits for what seems like forever for the text to go
through The text holds at 90

phone battery is red at 2

it doesn’t go through

The

She sends it again The text holds at 90 After an
agonizing wait success It goes through

She stands there snow falling on her covered in blood — Eli
dead Him hanging on by a thread She looks up toward the sky
and then off toward the end of cabin row the shed and then the
nothingness

Daphne lets out a huff and a stomp

Without enough time to fully express her frustration she
quickly secures the phone back into Daphne’s saddle bag before
heading back over toward Him

With all her might she begins to drag him down the small hill
slowly — he is heavy and it is difficult but the layer of slick
snow and all her adrenaline aid in the mission

We pull out from above to reveal the cabin and Veronica’s slow
journey with Him She gets further and further from the cabin
we can see the trail of blood through the snow

The path she is taking puts her in view of the perimeter guard
for about 10 feet She looks around the corner before
proceeding She lowers herself closer to the ground as she
drags him holding in any sound as she uses all her strength

Finally she is out of view of the perimeter guard not stopping
for even a moment before bumping up against a door

It is the burn shed

Unable to drag him anymore she kicks and rolls him into the
shed and props him up against the interior wall

HIM coughs up blood through a strained almost inaudible voice

HIM
Naive Eden Don’t you know
(beat)
Your emancipation is a complete
fabrication

Veronica stands expressionless starring at him
HIM (CONT)

You think this ends with me
This crusade

(coughing up blood struggling
to speak)
We are nowhere and everywhere

VERONICA
Having trouble getting your air
(sarcastically)
Senator
(beat)
I think it’s your turn to be quiet
(looking around)
this abomination ends NOW

HIM
You just don’t get it do you
(struggling)
You’ll destroy this country if given
the chance but after the Great War
we will return to the natural order —
the National Estate WILL restore the
white homeland

VERONICA
You’re a psychopath
(tilts head sideways)
Black is not a weapon you sick fuck
(pause)
If it was Trust
You would have been dead the moment
you laid your filthy hands on me
(pause)
But you know what
Your hate WILL NOT infect me
As you take your last breath just know
the country you claim as yours will
only remember you as a perverted mistake

Now trembling from the cold but satisfied in the moment
Veronica moves in and forcefully strips HIM’s Confederate coat
from his body and tucks it under her arm

She stands looks at HIM who is slumped over oozing blood from
his mouth She surveys the space before exiting the shed
running following the blood trail all the way back to the
cabin careful not to alert the guards

Upon arriving back at the cabin she finds everything as it was
Sean is on the floor dead lying in the cabin doorway Daphne

stands tall looking directly at Veronica Her black coat
shining beside the entryway torch

Veronica walks up to Daphne putting her hand on that beautiful
quarter horse’s forehead closing her eyes for just a moment
before throwing HIM’s jacket over the saddle

VERONICA
I’1l be right back

She then grabs the torch from beside the front door and darts
back toward the burn shed As she approaches the short distance
where the guard could spot her she stops She stops right in
the middle — right in plain view — glowing torch in hand

She starts walking then running toward the perimeter guard the
most immediate threat to her escape

VERONICA (CONT)
Help Come quick Help

Just then she runs directly into Jasper as the other perimeter
guard continues to run toward them

JASPER
What the fuck are you doing
out here You’ re----

A look of terror comes across Veronica’s face as she drops to
her knees She quickly regains her composure and

VERONICA
It’s the General
He’s hurt Real bad
(breathing heavily)
Come quick

Veronica gets up and begins running with them toward the burn
shed They outpace her and get there before she does and they
enter the shed Him is propped up right where Veronica left him
barely alive

PERIMETER GUARD
We recognize him as the flower
delivery man
Senator Senator

Him slowly raises his head

JASPER
(searching him for the wound)
General what happened

Jasper takes his coat off attempting to stop the bleeding HIM
looks just past Jasper and the guard as they tend to his
injuries

HIM slowly and painfully raises his arm pointing to Veronica
who is standing in the doorway He tries to alert Jasper but is
too late — the guard turns his head to see Veronica standing
just outside the shed

Veronica slams the door shut and secures the door block to lock
it in place Immediately we hear the guard pounding on the door
— screaming bloody murder

A satisfied grin comes over Veronica’s face before she slowly
moves toward the back of the shed torch in hand

Veronica opens the lower latch under the shed and lights the
ignitor before walking around the perimeter and lighting all
four corners for good measure before finally tossing the torch
up onto the roof

GUARD AND JASPER
Jesus No
Open the fucking door
(incessant pounding on door)
Help help
Open the fucking door
Oh my god
(screaming increases —
becoming inaudible)

VERONICA
(low almost to herself)
You don’t give the orders anymore

The screams grow louder and louder as they continue their
unrelenting pounding for mercy that goes unanswered This is
precisely what the shed was built for

Smoke billows into the pre-dawn sky as the agonizing screams go

from louder — now to softer — to silence only the sound of
timber and human flesh burning

The devil and his minion are no more

Veronica turns to walk away slowly bathing in satisfaction as
the burning shed is now fully engulfed in flames Veronica
outside the burn shed as the still burning-hot embers cascade
over her silhouette paints a surreal picture She knows she
must make haste anyone could have heard the screams and the
smoke is now fully visible from anywhere across the plantation
She has to get out of there Now

In the distance we hear muffled voices as Veronica runs back to
the cabin She finds the bloody ax laying on the ground next to
the front porch and grabs it before making her way to the
beautiful quarter horse Daphne

We can hear the sound of cannon and gunfire in the far distance
as Veronica runs her hand over Daphne’s head calming her before
attempting to mount

The muffled voices are getting closer we can now hear the
horse’s hooves on the ground

Without hesitation Veronica snatches HIM’s Confederate coat
draping it over her shivering torso

She then attempts to mount Daphne and falls off again and again
her blood-soaked exhausted body and Daphne’s silky coat prove
impossible until

Veronica finally secures her foot into the saddle strap and
manages to mount this time successfully onto that beautiful
quarter horse

Veronica pats her twice on the neck before giving the command
that she so often heard instructed by Him

VERONICA
Daphne Get Girl
Get

The snow falls across the wooded terrain as they leave the now
engulfed burn shed behind Veronica and that beautiful quarter
horse sprint through the woods that seem to go on forever

Daphne’s galloping hits the ground with such force we can hear
her hooves pound the earth We then notice other horses joining
in the chorus theyre fast approaching and almost upon Veronica
and Daphne

We hear rapid gunfire It is not a distant gunshot from battle
- nor is it the sound of a Civil War era gun — it is a modern
AR-15 No one is pretending any longer

The other perimeter guard is on horseback maybe 10 lengths
behind Veronica and gaining speed — with another rider maybe
50 yards behind him moving at a pace just a hair slower

As soon as Veronica and Daphne enter the forest one bullet
grazes Daphne’s ear setting them off balance and possibly ona
crash course Veronica soothes Daphne rubs her neck — their
bond now solidified indicated by Daphnes unrelenting march
toward freedom

Veronica looks back quickly toward the guard on horseback The
expansive battlefield slowly begins to come into the far distant
view but still quite a few miles out as cannon smoke and
snowfall share the horizon There is plenty of time for them to
catch up

A clearer path to the field and a brushy thicker path lie
ahead In an instant Veronica chooses the latter — the guard
follows behind Veronica as well as the other rider now picking
up the pace

Veronica navigates the brush with ease The guard is struggling
but manages to keep up

As both the guard and Veronica wind through the thick brush and
trees that seem to go on forever he lets off several quickly
repeating shots toward Veronica — one of them clipping the side
of her arm

Veronica doesn’t even flinch

Veronica and Daphne keep a determined almost super-natural pace
through the trees She winds through the expansive forest
impressively ducking and weaving her years of championship
equestrian training now evident Just ahead is a protruding low
branch that extends almost 20 feet out and about 4 feet high —
there is no way around it

Veronica and Daphne jump the branch beautifully — clearing it
by only an inch

The guard is relentless in his pursuit and has trained his
sights on Veronica as he aims his AR-15 again He does not
notice the branch until the last second when his horse abruptly
stops — its back legs rising off the ground letting out a loud

neigh while throwing the guard violently forward into the air
He is clotheslined by a tree-trunk sized branch before crashing
to the ground incapacitated if not dead

Veronica looks back for just a moment satisfied he is no longer
a threat but her reprieve would be short-lived — she is
interrupted by a gunshot coming at her from the other rider We
cut away from Veronica as we slowly see the other horse coming
into view

Emerging from the thick forest and falling snow we see
Elizabeth on horseback and realize she was the other rider
Elizabeth’s long flowing strawberry-blonde hair is disheveled
and flying wildly in the wind along with her black laced cape
and southern belle style dress

Once again an eerie hush drapes the forest Only the distant
sound of cannon and musket fire can be heard

Elizabeth lets out several gunshots into the air

ELIZABETH
(yelling)
Where the fuck are you you
fucking cunt
(gathers herself now calmly)
You killed my family
(waiving gun)
There is no way you are getting
out of here alive

Silence

ELIZABETH (CONT)
(growing frustrated)
I watched you
And I know what you think
(soft)
You think you’re better than me
(now screaming)
You think you’re better than me
Eden Eden Where are you

We only see hooves as they make an impression in the collecting
snow

An exasperated Elizabeth appearing to hold a conversation with
herself for Veronica’s benefit

ELIZABETH (CONT)
The lot of you — hand-picked by me
with one exception
I warned my father — “too risky a conquest”
I said but he insisted “Elizabeth
she’s spreading this filth
He just couldn’t resist —
the movement be damned
He HAD To have you
(sigh)
And now as always the woman is
left to clean up the mess of the man

Elizabeth is now just a short distance from Veronica — making
her way through the trees and brush We are watching her
Veronica is watching her — stalking her We see a knife attached
to Elizabeth’s waistband She is shooting in all directions
unsure of Veronica’s location She attempts another shot but
only a click She is out of bullets

ELIZABETH (CONT)
Eden
Come ouuuutt
(losing her temper)
Fuck you you fucking
black bitch EDEN
Get the fuck ba---

Before Elizabeth can get another word out of her mouth Veronica
comes from behind out of the brush and snaps back Elizabeth’s neck
with a rope tie from atop Daphne Veronica drags her Elizabeths
feet violently kicking the earth but it’s no use Veronica is
cutting off all oxygen as Elizabeths face goes from bright red
to purple Daphne stops and Veronica dismounts keeping
Elizabeth restrained with the rope tie

Elizabeth’s legs are flailing and her arms are reaching for
Veronica’s face Veronica successfully dodges her attempts
until Elizabeth grabs a hold of Veronica’s hair with one hand
and pulls her head toward her As she does she grasps on to
her head with her other hand as well Now with a firm grip but
losing air Elizabeth gives Veronica one hard pull knocking her
off her feet Elizabeth then reaches for her knife on her
waistband and quickly cuts herself loose of the rope Elizabeth
takes a deep breath before Veronica comes back at her landing
one good closed-fist hit across Elizabeth’s face blood
splatters from her jaw and the knife falls from her hand into

the dirt Elizabeth turns back quickly getting her hands around
Veronica’s neck as Veronica squirms and kicks to get away

Veronica’s hands search the ground for anything in a desperate
attempt to get away but there is nothing Elizabeth is laser-
focused squeezing her neck with her arms fully extended
Veronica is losing air and dying slowly Elizabeth has
overpowered her

Veronica desperately tries to push Elizabeth off to no avail
swatting at her body She feels around the ground and just in
time identifies the knife grabs it and slides it into
Elizabeth’s thigh in one fluid motion as the two women share an
intense eye-to-eye stare Elizabeth then releases her iron grip
on Veronica’s neck

VERONICA
What is wrong with you
(smashing Elizabeth’s head into the ground)
What kind of woman are you

Enraged Veronica continues her assault — we hear Elizabeths
head hit violently against a stump knocking her out — she may
be dead Veronica keeps ahold of her neck for another few
seconds for good measure

Veronica looks at Elizabeth with the same bewildered expression
she had during that fateful Skype conference Veronica then
stands up and takes a long deep breath while looking down at
Elizabeths vacant stare — satisfied she is no longer an
immediate threat the rope-tie still loose around Elizabeth’s
neck

Veronica hears the overseers getting closer and re-mounts
Daphne and is just about to cut Elizabeth loose when we hear a
single gun shot echo through the nothingness This spooks
Daphne who takes off violently almost throwing Veronica from
her saddle

Elizabeth is dragged across the forest floor as they continue
their journey toward a clearing in the distance Elizabeth is
coming to desperately grabbing at the rope and begins to wail
in agonizing breathless screams Veronica unsuccessfully tries
once again to cut the tether but it’s no use Daphne is moving
at far too fast a clip

Jasper and Elizabeth’s horses ghost ride running close behind
Veronica and Daphne almost appearing to join in the escape

Elizabeth’s screams grow louder more urgent as Veronica

continues her desperate attempts to cut the dead weight — just
as Veronica finally cuts through the last of the twine
untethering Elizabeth — Elizabeth simultaneously slams head

first into what appears to be a giant stone The impact
violently snaps her neck leaving Elizabeth’s now lifeless body
wedged between two objects we can’t quite make out

Veronica and Daphne now frozen in their tracks look back to
see Elizabeth’s broken body As we pan out we reveal that she
and Daphne are mirroring a giant monument of Robert E Lee on
horseback maybe 20 feet tall sword in the air — his ghost
guarding the haunted forest beside a Caterpillar fork lift
Veronica pulls up Daphne’s reins for just a moment as she slowly
cuts Elizabeth loose

Veronica’s face reads a look of total shock as she and Daphne
are shaded by the shadow of Robert E Lee But there is no time
for contemplation we hear fast approaching gunshots Veronica
snaps back to reality and bolts towards the battlefield with a
quickness— now that she and Daphne are no longer weighed down
by Elizabeth

The overseers clear the final obstacle of trees — they are just
about at the border of the battlefield — determined relentless
Veronica looks back fleetingly to see the posted placards with
an image of a circled cell phone with a line through it

Looking like a woman possessed an other-worldly goddess with
her blood-drenched legs squeezing Daphne with the last of her
strength commanding that beautiful quarter horse to keep pace
Veronica is swinging Sean’s ax in the air she is enveloped by
the eerie soft falling snow screaming in absolute disbelief
that her hard-fought liberation is within reach — as she enters
the “active” battlefield where Union soldiers intersect with The
Sons of the South

The remaining overseers on horseback make it to the edge of the
woods after Veronica has already entered the battlefield They
stop abruptly right at the forest line — not entering the
battlefield behind her

VERONICA
Get
(lifts her head up to take in the
full battle scene as she raises her
ax while she rides and screams out)
Get Good girl Get

Veronica and Daphne ride straight through the field of cannons
bayonets and “soldiers” — the smoke from the cannons drape the
morning sky shadowed by the snow

Veronica’s bloody body and bare feet make her feel freer than
she has ever been She looks back at the Confederate and Union
soldiers waiting for a gunshot to materialize as she works her
way through the center of combat — but it never comes — only
shock and dismay on the faces of the soldiers

Veronica doesnt stop — pushing forward as familiar plumes of
smoke float upward in the distance behind her She and Daphne
ride all the way past the horizon

Gun smoke gives way to flashing lights from a sea of approaching
police cars as a helicopter zips by overhead Stunned
spectators in modern civilian clothing record the moment with
their cellphones — as Veronica and Daphne pass the entryway of
the park we see a metal sign that reads

“Antebellum
Louisiana’s Premier Civil War Reenactment Park
All major credit cards and Apple Pay accepted
Private Property — No Trespassing”

The camera winds back through the battlefield weaving between
the reenactors and cannon smoke until we return to the edge of
the forest and spot the little blonde girl emerging from the
shadows She stops just at the edge of the battlefield with a
sinister look on her face unfazed by the pandemonium now
engulfing the property

CuT TO BLACK
SLOW FADE IN FROM BLACK

The battlefield entrance is visible (for just a beat) before a
bulldozer enters the frame demolishing the Antebellum sign as
we slowly pull out to a full aerial view of the entirety of the
property (which appears to be comprised of tens of thousands of
acres of land) — both the public re-enactment park and the
private plantation At least fifty or so federal authorities
donning yellow-lettered FBI blue windbreakers can be seen
scouring the cotton fields the Great House and cabin row

NEWS CLIP AUDIO OVER VISUAL (VOICE OF WOLF BLITZER)
