EXTERIOR- IRAQ- EXCATVATION SITE- NINEVEH- DAY

Pickaxes and shovels weld into the air as hundreds of excavators
tear at the desert The camera pans around the area where
hundreds of Iraqi workmen dig for ancient finds The caption
Northern Iraq appears at the bottom of the screen as the digging
continues The camera then follows a young boy running bare foot
over the rocky mounds He comes to a stop and the camera is
positioned in between the boys legs looking at and aging man also
digging

YOUNG BOY

man who looks in command is there to greet him

MAN

Some interesting finds Lamps arrow-heads coins

The old man picks up an old pendant and holds it up

MERRIN
(In Iraqi language)
This is strange

The man dusts the pendant and takes a look

MAN
(In Iraqi language)
Not of the same period

The old man reaches into a hole in the rock moving and re-
arranging small rocks to see what he can find He grabs a pickaxe
and scrapes out a small sculpted piece of rock crushed into
another The man takes a dust brush from the mans pocket and
brushes some dust from the sculpted rock As the dust is swept we
see that it is a face The old man recognises it and looks
worried He brakes the sculpted rock away from the ordinary rock
and takes a good look at it

EXTERIOR- IRAQ- MARKET PLACE- DAY
An Iragi man walks through the noisy crowd with a tray and up to
the old mans table He puts the drink on the table and watches
as the old man opens a small pendant full of pills and puts one
into his mouth The old man is trembling with fear as he downs
his drink He puts the glass down and looks at the people around
him The man with the tray comes back to the old mans table and
picks up the glass

MAN WITH TRAY
(In Iraqi language)
Something else

MERRIN
(In Iraqi language)
No thank you

The old man stands up and looks at the bus boy We cut to a group
of workers hitting there hammers on an anvil The old man walks
in there direction but stops as he sees one of the workers stop
work to wipe his brow When the worker makes eye contact with the
old man we see that the worker has one eye without pigment
bleached white as if it has rolled backward The old man stares
at him and then walks on

We see a clocks pendulum swinging uncovered sculpted rocks of
all kinds and a man sitting at a desk writing up the report on
what they found The old man picks up the pendant he found and
then the rock head he found and takes a look

MERRIN
(In Iraqi language)
Evil against evil

The man at the table looks confused

MAN
(In Iraqi language)
Father

We then see the clocks pendulum stop over the old mans shoulder
He turns around and walks toward it After looking he sits down
beside it As he sits the man at the desk stands up

reaches the tunnel a horse and cart flies out in front of him
aboard the cart we see a frightened old women The old man looks
around as if he was lucky to survive

The old man arrives back at that dig site in a small jeep As he
pulls up two armed guards rush out When they see who it is the

quarters The old man walks up the rocky mound and sees a huge
statue of the demon Pazuzu which has the head of the small rock
he earlier found He climbs to a higher point to get a closer
look When he reaches the highest point he looks at the statue
dead on He then turns his head as we hear rocks falling and sees
a guard standing behind him He then turns again when he hears
two dogs savagely attacking each other The noise is something of
an evil nature He looks again at the statue and we are then
presented with a classic stand off side view of the old man and
the statue as the noises rage on We then fade to the sun slowly
setting as the noises lower in volume

electrical activity of the brain In the case of your daughter in
the temperal lobe up here in the lateral part of the brain Its
rare but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just
before a convulsion

CHRIS
Convulsion

DR KLEIN
The shaking of the bed thats doubtless due to musuclar spasms

CHRIS

Oh no that was no spasm I got on the bed the whole bed was
thumping and rising off the floor and shaking The whole thing

Klein and Tanney exit Regans room and approach them Chris
stands

DR KLEIN
Shes heavily sedated Shell probably sleep through tomorrow

CHRIS
What was going on in there how could she jump off the bed like
that

DR TANNEY

Pathological states can induce abnormal strength accelerated
motor performance For example a ninety-pound women sees her
child pinned under the wheel of a truck runs out and lifts the
wheels half a foot up off the ground You know the story same
thing here Same principle I mean

CHRIS
So whats wrong with her

DR KLEIN
We still think the temporal lobe

CHRIS

Oh What are you talking about for Christ sake Did you see her
or not Shes acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or
a split personality or

DR TANNEY

There havent been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so-
called split personality Mrs MacNeil Now I know the temptation
is to leap to psychiatry but any reasonable psychiatrist would
exhaust the somatic possibilities first

CHRIS
So whats next

DR TANNEY
A pneumoencephelogram I would think pin down that lesion It
will involve another spinal

CHRIS
Oh Christ

DR TANNEY

What we missed in the EEG and the arteriogram could conceivably
turn up there At the least it would eliminate certain other
possibilities

INTERIOR- MEDICAL LABORATORY- DAY

We see a piece of heavy machinery swivelling above the camera We
then see Regan strapped to a table hooked up to the machine
Shes yelping in pain

INTERIOR- DR KLEINS OFFICE-DAY

noiselessly and swiftly down the staircase She halts directly

EXTERIOR- RUNNING TRACK- GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY- DAY

In training gear Karras is running laps Seated on a bench at

Karras stops panting Kinderman rises and moves toward him

KINDERMAN

Karras picks up his towel and wipes his brow

KARRAS

Karras walks away toward the campus

KINDERMAN
You this director was doing a film here Burke Dennings

KARRAS
Ive seen him

KINDERMAN
Youve seen him Youre also familiar with how last week he died

KARRAS
Only what I read in the papers

KINDERMAN
Papers Tell me what do you know about the subject of
witchcraft From the witching end not the hunting

KARRAS
I once did a paper on it

KINDERMAN
Really

KARRAS
From the psychiatric end

KINDERMAN
I know I read it These desecrations in the churchyou think
they have anything to do with witchcraft

KARRAS
Maybe Some rituals used in Black Mass Maybe

KINDERMAN
And Dennings you read how he died

KARRAS
Yeah a fall

KINDERMAN

Let me tell you how Father and please confidential Burke
Dennings good Father was found at the bottom of those steps
leading to M Street with his head turned completely around
Facing backwards

KARRAS
Couldnt it of happened on the fall

KINDERMAN
Its possible Possible however

KARRAS
Unlikely

KINDERMAN
Exactly So on the one hand weve got a witchcraft type of murder
and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church

KARRAS
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same

KINDERMAN
Maybe somebody crazy someone with a spite against the church
some unconscious rebellion perhaps

KARRAS
Sick priest is that it

KINDERMAN

Look Father this is hard for you- please But for priests on the
campus here youre the psychiatrist youd know who was sick at
the time who wasnt I mean this kind of sickness Youd know
that

KARRAS
I dont know anyone who fits the description

KINDERMAN
Ah doctors ethics If you knew you wouldnt tell huh

KARRAS
No I probably wouldnt

KINDERMAN

Not to bother you with trivia but a psychiatrist in sunny
California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he
knew about a patient

KARRAS
Is that a threat

KINDERMAN
No I mentioned it only in passing

KARRAS
Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the
judge that it was a matter of confession

Karras walks off toward his dormitory and Kinderman chases him

KINDERMAN

EXTERIOR- BARRINGER CLINIC- DAY

The leaves blow as the camera zooms in on the Barringer Clinic

INTERIOR- BARRINGER CLINIC- WARD- DAY
CLINIC DIRECTOR
It looks like a type of disorder that you rarely ever see
anymore except in primitive cultures

We see Regan on a monitor screen Shes in another fit in bed
and restrained by straps

CLINIC DIRECTOR
We call it a somnambuliform possession

We cut to another angle of Regan who has slightly visible welts
on her face Shes still screaming We then cut to Regan now
flat on her back mumbling to herself

INTERIOR- BARRINGER CLINIC- DIRECTORS OFFICE- DAY

CLINIC DIRECTOR

Quite frankly we dont know much about it except that its
starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the
patients delusion that his bodys been invaded by an alien
intellegence a spirit if you will

CHRIS
Look Im telling you again and youd better believe it Im not
about to put her in a goddamn asylum

CLINIC DIRECTOR
Its-

CHRIS
And I dont care what you call it Im not putting her away

CLINIC DIRECTOR
Im sorry

CHRIS
Youre sorry Christ eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell
me is all of your bullshit

CLINIC DIRECTOR- There is one outside chance of a cure I think
of it as shock treatment As I say there is an outside chance

CHRIS
Will you just name it for Gods sake What is it

MALE DOCTOR
Do you have any religious beliefs

CHRIS
No

FEMALE DOCTOR
What about your daughter

CHRIS
No why
CLINIC DIRECTOR
Have you ever heard of exorcism

Chris looks at him baffled

CLINIC DIRECTOR

Its a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive
out the so-called invading spirit Its pretty much discarded
these days except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as
a sort of embarrassment It has worked in fact although not for
the reason they think of course It was purely the force of
suggestion The victims belief in possession helped cause it
and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can
make it disappear

CHRIS
Youre telling me that I should take my daughter to a witch
doctor Is that it

The Clinic Director nods and looks at Chris
EXTERIOR- PROSPECT STREET- MACNEIL HOUSE- DAY

KINDERMAN

is a magic carpet for bacteria

Karl enters the room

KARL
Excuse me Madame Will there be anything else

CHRIS
No thanks Karl

Karl stands in the background Chris turns to him

CHRIS
Its okay Karl

Karl exits

KINDERMAN

Strangestrangeso baffling The deceased comes to visit
stays only twenty minutes and leaves all alone a very sick girl
And speaking plainly Mrs MacNeil as you say its not likely he
would fall from a window Besides that a fall wouldnt do to his
neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand My hunch
My opinion I believe he was killed by a very powerful man point
one And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the
various things I have mentioned would make it very probable -
probable not certain - that the deceased was killed and then
pushed from your daughters window But no-one was here except
your daughter So how could this be It could be one way if
someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the
time you returned The servants they have visitors

CHRIS
No Not at all

KINDERMAN
You were expecting a deliver y that day

CHRIS
Not that I know of

KINDERMAN
Groceries maybe A package

I really wouldnt know you see Karl takes care of that

KINDERMAN
Oh I see

Want to ask him

KINDERMAN
Never mind

Chris rises

Would you like some more coffee

KINDERMAN
Please

Kinderman follows Chris further into the kitchen He notices some
of Regans artwork He picks up a small sculpted Turtle and
examines it

KINDERMAN
Thats cute

Chris looks over at Kinderman

KINDERMAN
Your daughter shes the artist

Chris smiles She hands him the coffee

KINDERMAN

Incidentally just a chance in a million I know but your
daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr Dennings in
her room that night

CHRIS
Look he wouldnt have any reason to be up there in the first
place

KINDERMAN

I know that I realize But if a certain British doctor never
asked Whats this fungus we wouldnt today have penicillin
Correct

CHRIS
When shes well enough Ill ask

KINDERMAN
Couldnt hurt In the meantime

Kinderman falters embarrassed

KINDERMAN
I hate to ask you this but for my daughter could you maybe
give an autograph

CHRIS
Of course Have you got a pen

Kinderman pulls out a pen and a calling card and gives them to

Chris

KINDERMAN
Oh shed love it

CHRIS
Whats her name

Kinderman hesitates His eyes are desperate and defiant

CHRIS
About my daughter

KARRAS
No I didnt know you had one
CHRIS
He didnt mention

KARRAS
No

CHRIS
Didnt tell you of what she did

KARRAS
He didnt mention her

CHRIS
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then

KARRAS
That depends

CHRIS
On what

KARRAS
The priest

CHRIS

I mean what if a person lets say was a criminal like maybe a
murderer or something you know If he came to you for help
would you have to turn him in

KARRAS
If he came to me for spritual help Id say no

CHRIS
You wouldnt

KARRAS
No I wouldnt But Id try to persuade him to turn himself in

CHRIS
And how do you go about getting an exorcism

KARRAS
I beg your pardon

CHRIS
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind how do you go
about getting an exorcism

KARRAS
Well the first thing Id do is put them into a time macine and

send them back to the sixteenth century

CHRIS
I didnt get you

KARRAS
Well it just doesnt happen anymore Mrs MacNeil

CHRIS
Oh yeah since when

KARRAS

Since we learned about mental illness paranoia schizophrenia
All the things they taught me in Harvard Mrs MacNeil since the
day I joined the Jesuits Ive never met one priest who has
performed an exorcism not one

CHRIS
Yeah well it just so happens that somebody very close to me is
probably possessed and needs an exorcist

Chris bursts into tears

CHRIS
Father Karras its my little girl

Karras grabs Chris arm and walks her over to a bench They both
sit Chris is still crying

KARRAS
Thats all the more reason to forget about exorcism

CHRIS
Why I dont understand

KARRAS
To begin with it could make things worse

CHRIS
But how

KARRAS

Well before the church approves an exorcism it conducts an
investigation to see if its warranted That takes time In the
meantime

CHRIS
You could do it yourself

KARRAS
No I couldnt I have to have church approval and frankly
thats rarely given-

CHRIS
Could you see her

KARRAS
Yes I could I could see her as a psychiatrist

CHRIS

Not a psychiatrist She needs a priest Shes already seen every
fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you now
youre gonna send me back to them Jesus Christ wont somebody
help her

KARRAS
No you dont understand Your daughter-

CHRIS
Oh will you help her Just help her

Chris bursts into tears again and buries her head into Karras
shoulder Karras puts his arm around her

INTERIOR- MACNETL HOUSE- STAIRCASE- DAY

Chris and Karras are ascending the staircase When they reach the
door we see Karl holding a huge headboard with straps and padding
on it

KARL
It wants no straps

Karras stares at him then gives Chris a look He plucks up his
courage and enters the room

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- REGANS BEDROOM- DAY

Karras stops as he sees Regan on the bed arms held down by a
set of restraining straps it seems no longer entirley Regan but
something somehow demonic that now lies on the bed and stares at
him Her face is puffy scratched and bruised from self-
mutilation There is a sustagen flask used for a naso-gastric
feeding the tube is placed up her left nostril Karras is
momentarily taken aback Then reining in his revulsion he
slowly and warily closes the door behind him and walks around
the other side of the bed

KARRAS
Hello Regan Ima friend of your mother Id like to help you

REGAN DEMON
You might loosen the straps then

KARRAS
Im affraid you might hurt yourself Regan

REGAN DEMON
Im not Regan

KARRAS
I see Well then lets introduce ourselves Im Damien Karras

REGAN DEMON
And Im the Devil Now kindly undo these straps

KARRAS
If youre the devil why not make the straps disappear

REGAN DEMON

KARRAS

REGAN DEMON

KARRAS

REGANHOMELESS GUY

Karras looks at Regan Hes puzzled by what she has just said He
sits down on a chair beside the window

REGAN DEMON
Your mothers in here with us Karras would you like to leave a
message Ill see that she gets it

KARRAS
If thats true then you must know my mothers maiden name What

Regan keeps a sharp stare on Karras Karras smile turns to an
angry stare He rises and moves to her bed side

KARRAS
What is it

Regan leans forward a vomits a disgusting green bile in Karras
face Karras wipes it off coughing Regan keeps her eyes fixed
on him with green vomit covering her night gown

INTERIOR- MACNETL HOUSE- BASEMENT- EARLY EVENING

Karras is looking through some of Regans drawings Chris
approaches him with his sweater now clean She hands it to him

KARRAS
Thanks Look Im only against the possibility of doing your
daughter more harm than good

CHRIS
Nothing you could do would make it any worse

KARRAS
I cant do it I need evidence that the church would accept as
signs of possession

CHRIS
Like what

KARRAS
Like her speaking in a language that shes never known or
studied
CHRIS
What else

KARRAS
I dont know Ill have to look it up

CHRIS
I thought you were supposed to be an expert

KARRAS

There are no experts You probably know as much about possession
than most priests Look your daughter doesnt say shes a demon
she says shes the devil himself and if youve seen as many
psychotics as I have youd know its like saying youre Napoleon
Bonaparte You ask me what I think is best for your daughter Six
months under observation in the best hospital you can find

CHRIS

You show me Regans double same face same voice same
everything Id know it wasnt Regan Id know in my gut and Im
telling you that that thing upstairs isnt my daughter And I
want you to tell me that you know for a fact that theres nothing
wrong with my daughter except in her mind You tell me you know
for a fact that an exorcism wouldnt do any good You tell me
that

Regans head falls back onto the pillow as she rolls her head
from side to side shouting out indistrict gibberish

I know

KARRAS
Thank you your excellency

traveler frozen in time

MERRIN
Why
EXTERIOR- UNIVERSITY STEPS-NIGHT

Karras is running down the steps carrying a the cassocks anda
large case

MERRIN

( Voice Over )

Especially important is the warning to avoid conversation with
the demon

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- STUDY- NIGHT
Karras and Merrin are dressing in vestments taken from the case

MERRIN

We may ask what is relevant but anything beyond that is
dangerous He is a liar the demon is a liar He will lie to
confuse us But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack
us The attack is psychological Damien And powerful So dont
listen remember that do not listen

KARRAS

I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the
different personalities Regan has manifested So far there seems
to be three Shes convinced-

MERRIN
Theres only one

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- SECOND FLOOR LANDING- NIGHT

horrible growling noises in the room The priests approach Chris
and Sharon bundled in sweaters The priests halt and look at
Chris

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- REGANS BEDROOM- NIGHT

Merrin opens the door and sees Regan staring at him with burning
eyes Merrin steps into the room follwed by Karras Karras closes
the door on Chris before she walks in Merrin walks to the side
of the bed and Karras halts at the foot ( the room is freezing
Breath is condensing throughout) Merrin lays his holy water on
the bedside table takes a crucifix out of a leather case He
then traces the sign of the cross at Regan She looks up

REGAN DEMON
Stick your cock up her ass You mother fucking worthless

cocksucker

MERRIN
Be silent

Merrin sprinkles some holy water on her She throws her head back
and crys in pain Merrin leans down beside her and opens up The
Roman Ritual

MERRIN
Our Father who art in heaven

Regan spits and hits Merrin in the eye with a yellowish glob of
mucus that slowly oozes down his cheek Karras quickly hides
behind the bed post as Merrin pulls out a handkerchief and
unhurriedly wipes away the spittle

MERRIN

Hallowed be thy name Thy kingdom come thy will be done on
earth as it is in heaven Give us this day our daily bread and
forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass
against us And lead us not into temptation

KARRAS
But deliver us from the evil one

Regan is coughing and groaning as the two priests continue with
the ritual

MERRIN

Save me o God by thy name by thy might defend my cause proud
men have risen up against me men of violence seek my life but
God is my helper the Lord sustains my life and every need he has
delivered to me glory be to the Father the Son and the Holy
Spirit

KARRAS

end amen

MERRIN
Save your servant

KARRAS
Who places her trust in thee my God

MERRIN
Be unto her o Lord a fortified tower

KARRAS
In the face of the enemy

Regan raises her head and screams at Merrin several times

MERRIN
Let the enemy have no power over her

KARRAS
And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her

REGAN DEMON
Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras you faithless slime
MERRIN
OLord hear my prey

KARRAS
And let my cry come unto thee

MERRIN
The Lord be with you

KARRAS
And also with you

MERRIN

Let us pray Holy Lord almighty Father everlasting God and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who once and for all consigned
that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell Who sent your only
begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion

Regans bed begins to jump up and down crashing onto the floor
Regan continues to scream at the two priests

MERRIN

Hasten to our call for help and snatch from ruination and from
the clutches of the noonday devil this human being made in your
image and likeness Strike terror Lord into the beast now
laying waste your vineyard let your mighty hand cast him out of
your servant Regan Teresa MacNeil so he may no longer hold
captive this person whom it pleased you to make in your image

Merrin sprinkles more holy water on Regan She falls back crying
in pain

MERRIN
and to redeem through your son Who lives and reigns with you
in the unity of the holy spirit God forever and ever

KARRAS
Amen

MERRIN
OLord hear my preyer

To Karras amazement the bed begins to rise Merrin waits for
Damiens reponse but Karras is frozen with shock as the bed
rises past his face

MERRIN
Father Karras Father Karras Damien The reponse please Damien

KARRAS
And let my cry come unto thee

The bed crashes back to the floor Regan still screams and
writhes in pain

MERRIN
Almighty Lord word of God the father Jesus Christ God and Lord
of all creation who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp
underfoot serpents and scorpions Grant me your unworthy servant
pardon for all my sins

REGAN DEMON
Bastards Stop

Regan stares at Father Karras and snakes her abnormaly long
tongue in and out at him

MERRIN
and the power to confront this cruel demon

KARRAS
Amen

Regan falls back on her pillow and begins to groan Both priests
trace the sign of the cross Merrin holds his purple stole to
Regans cheek as green vomit slowly oozes from her mouth Regan
turns her head and vomits on the stole

MERRIN
See the cross of the Lord Be gone you hostile power OLord hear
my prayer

KARRAS
And let my cry come unto thee

MERRIN
The Lord be with you

KARRAS
And also with you

Merrin takes the bile covered stole from around his neck and
hands it to Karras who quickly washes it in Regans bathroom We
hear banging as cupboard doors open against the wall Regan is
flat on her back laughing wickedly Merrin holds his hands to his
ears because of the noise Karras hands the stole back to Merrin
who kisses it before applying around his neck Regan continues to
laugh as Merrin begins to cough violently

MERRIN
I cast you out Unclean spirit

REGAN DEMON
Shove it up your ass you faggot

MERRIN

in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ It is he who commands
you He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of
hell

REGAN DEMON
Fuck him

MERRIN
Be gone

REGAN DEMON
Fuck him Karras Fuck him

MERRIN
from this creature of God

Regan lays back as Merrin races to her bedside tracing the sign
of the cross with his fingers in her hair

MERRIN

Be gone In the name of the Father and of the son and of the
holy spirit By this sign of the holy cross of our Lord Jesus
Christ who lives and reigns with the father and the holy
spirit

Regan sits up and with a nightmare slowness a fraction at a
time her head begins to turn swiveling like a mannequins and
creaking with the sound of a rusted mechanism Once again
Damiens attention is diverted and Merrin has to prompt him

MERRIN
Damien

Her head completly turns in a 360-degree turn and stares at
Karras

KARRAS
Amen

MERRIN
Defender of the human race

A thunderous earthquake knock both priests to the ground

MERRIN
look down in pity

REGAN DEMON
You killed your mother You left her alone to die Shell
never forgive you Bastard

KARRAS
Shut up

MERRIN
- upon this your servant Regan Teresa MacNeil

Another quake knocks them to the ground Regan falls back the

bed sheets fly off of the bed and the straps slowly rip apart

Regans eyes roll back into the socket and she slowly starts to
levitate

MERRIN
I command you by the judge of the living and the dead to depart
from this servant of God
Regan is now levitating toward the celing arms out stretched
like a cross

MERRIN
Its the power (To Karras)- Holy water

Karras runs to the bedside table and grabs the bottle of holy
water he runs back and gives it to Merrin

MERRIN
Its the power of Christ that compels you

MERRIN KARRAS
The power of Christ compels you

Merrin sprinkles holy water

MERRIN KARRAS
The power of Christ compels you

Merrin sprinkles holy water and we see a cut appear on her skin

MERRIN KARRAS
The power of Christ compels you The power of Christ compels you
The power of Christ compels you The power of Christ compels you

Regan begins to descend

MERRIN KARRAS

The power of Christ compels you The power of Christ compels you
The power of Christ compels you The power of Christ compels you
The power of Christ compels you The power of Christ compels you
The power of Christ compels you

Regan lands back on the bed once more

MERRIN KARRAS
The power of Christ compels you

Karras rushes to the bed and ties her hands together to symbolize
the cross

MERRIN
He brought you low by his bloodstained cross Do not despise my
command because you no me to be a sinner Its God himself who
commands you The majestic Christ who commands God the Father
commands you God the son commands you

As Karras turns away Regan raises her tied hands and deals him a
powerful blow on the back of his head He falls to the floor

MERRIN
God the holy spirit commands you

Merrin sprinkles more holy water on Regan she falls back and
screams in pain
MERRIN
The mystery of the cross commands you The blood of the martyrs
commands you

The priests are again knocked to the floor by an earthquake
Briefly Regan lifts herself toward an apparition of the demon
statue Pazuzu

MERRIN

Give way to Christ you prince of murderers Youre guilty
before Almighty God guilty before his son guilty before the
whole human race Its the Lord who expels you He who is coming
to judge both the living and the dead and the world by fire

As Merrin kneels by the bed Karras crawls over and covers Regan
with a blanket

MERRIN
Are you tired

Karras nods

MERRIN
Lets rest before we start again

Merrin leaves the room but Karras stays sat on the bed
shivering with both coldness and fear Regan is asleep

INTERIOR- MACNETL HOUSE- SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY- STAIRS- NIGHT

An exhausted Merrin and Karras are sitting in the hallway on the
stairs outside the bathroom

KARRAS
Why this girl it makes no sense

MERRIN
I think the point is to make us dispair To see our selves
as animal and ugly To reject the possibillity that God

could love us

MERRIN
Will you excuse me Damien

Merrin rises and moves toward the bathroom

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- BATHROOM- NIGHT

The doorbell rings and Chris moves toward the door Before
opening she applies the chain lock on She opens the door slowly
and we see Kinderman staring at her from the gap

INTERIOR- MACNEIL HOUSE- REGANS BEDROOM- NIGHT

Karras re-enters Regans room and sees Merrin face down on her
bed Regan is sitting up against the bottom right hand bed post
as Karras pulls Merrin to the floor Karras feels for Merrins
pulse then tries frantically to pump life back into the priest
with blows to his chest but gives up when he realises Merrin is
dead He hears a giggle and turns to Regan

KARRAS
You son of a bitch

He grabs her and pulls her to the floor He begins to punch her
in the face and head then shakes her and nearly strangles her in
his fury

KARRAS
Take me Come into me God damn you Take me Take me

A gargantuan struggle is visible in the demonic features of
Regans face His face has taken on a demonic shade and his eyes
have turned bright green She screams out as Karras body jerks
back apparently manipulated by some inner force which now
reaches toward Regan to strangle her Karras fights the force for
control of his body and he screams compelling it toward the
window

KARRAS
No

With his last angiushed cry Karras leaps out of the window We
see him roll down the concrete steps outside and hit the floor at
the bottom His cry was immediatly followed by frightened sobs
and whimpers that are unmstakably those of an ordinary little
girl

REGAN
(crying)
MotherMotherMotherMother

Chris rushes in and pauses to make sure that its really Regan
again Shes follwed in by Kinderman

CHRIS
Rags

She dashes over to where her daughter is cowering on the floor
She flings herself down on top of Regan cradling her and crying
in hysterical relief as Kinderman looks at Karras body from the
window looks at Merrins dead body on the floor and then looks
at Chris and Regan

EXTERIOR- M-STREET- STEPS- NIGHT

A crowd is gathering at the scene of an accident Their
attentionis focused by a man lying in a pool of blood on the
pavement at the foot of the steps under Regans window

BYSTANDER
Somebody fell at the bottom of the steps here

Father Dyer pushes through the crowd and kneels beside Karras
Fighting back tears he grasps Karras hand and leans close to
whisper in his ear

FATHER DYER

Do you want to make your confession Are you sorry- (his voice
catches)

Are you sorry for having offended God with all the sins of your
past life (he breaks down for a moment then starts
administiring the last rites

Ego to abslovo in nomine patris et filli et spiritus sancti
Amen

As a wailling siren signals the approach of an ambulance Dyer
weeps openly

EXTERIOR- PROSPECT STREET- TOP OF STEPS- DAY

On a bright sunny day we are looking down the steps which are
now clean No blood or body at the bottom
