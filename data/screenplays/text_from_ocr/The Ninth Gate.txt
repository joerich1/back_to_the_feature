THE NINTH GATE

A Screenplay by Roman Polanski John Brownjohn and Enrique Urbizu
Based on a novel by Arturo Perez-Reverte

1 TELFER HOUSE LIBRARY INTNIGHT

ANDREW TELFER a scrawny seventy-year-old is writing a note at
his desk in one corner of a big book-lined room Dangling from
the central chandelier is a noose A chair stands beneath it

TELFER looks up for a moment Blankly he eyes a framed
photoportrait on his desk a beautiful thirty-something blonde
returns his gaze with an enigmatic smile

He stops writing and folds the sheet scrawls something on the
back and leaves it on the desk Then he walks to the centre of
the room and climbs on the chair He puts his head through the
noose and tightens it around his neck

He kicks away the back of the chair but it doesnt fall

Frantically he tries again this time the chair topples over
The chandelier squeaks as it swings on its hook but it holds
Fragments of plaster come raining down

TELFERs neck isnt broken he starts to choke His feet perform
a convulsive dance in mid-air only six inches above the floor
one of his shoes comes off

The CAMERA leaves the dying man and MOVES IN on the bookshelves
To the accompaniment of choking sounds it PANS across the
serried rows of volumes until it reaches a gap that shows where
one of them has been removed

The choking sounds cease

The CAMERA enters the black void left by the missing book
Absolute abysmal DARKNESS

3 MANHATTAN APARTMENT INTDAY

The Manhattan skyline seen through a picture window Above it
reflected in the windowpane the face of an OLD WOMAN seated with
her back to the room Her expression is impassive and self-
a

bsorbed her twisted mouth suggests shes a stroke victim She
seems quite uninvolved in the action behind her

CORSO (OS) An impressive collection You have some very rare
editions here Sure you want to sell them all

We now discover the speaker BOB CORSO a tall lean rather
unkempt man in his 30s Steel-rimmed glasses crumpled old tweed
jacket worn cords scuffed brown oxfords He could almost be a
shabby university teacher if it werent for the street-wise glint
in his eye
He replaces a book on a shelf Standing beside him is the Old
Womans SON a middle-aged man with a puffy red face Her
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW looks on one hand cupping her elbow the fingers
of the other playing avidly with her lower lip The SON is
cuddling a large Scotch on the rocks like its an integral part
of his anatomy His tone is too lugubrious to be true

SON Theyre no use to Father not anymore -not now hes passed
away His library was his own little world Now its just a
painful memory for Mother here

DAUGHTER-IN-LAW Unbearably painful

CORSO glances at them over the top of his glasses then at the
OLD WOMAN Its clear that the OLD WOMANs true source of pain is
their rapacious desire to convert her late husbands library into
hard cash

CORSO picks up a notebook adjusts his glasses with an
instinctive habitual movement taps the notebook with his

pencil

CORSO Well at a rough preliminary estimate you have a
collection here worth around two hundred thousand dollars

DAUGHTER-IN-LAW (almost jumps) Two hundred thousand

CORSO Or thereabouts

He smiles sweetly at the DAUGHTER-IN-LAW

The OLD WOMAN continues to stare blankly at her reflection in the
window Behind her the SON sidles up to CORSO who indicates the
volumes in question

SON How much were you thinking of

CORSO Hmm I couldnt go higher than four grand -- four-and-a-
half tops (takes an envelope from his shoulder bag and starts
peeling off some bills)

4 MANHATTAN APARTMENT HOUSE CORRIDOR INTDAY

CORSO strides briskly along the corridor toward the elevator with
the canvas bag slung from his shoulder Hes grinning to himself
The bag is obviously heavier than it was

The elevator doors open just as hes about to press the button
He almost collides with a bespectacled briefcase-carrying man in
a three-piece suit and bow tie (WITKIN) -- a cross between an
intellectual and a business executive

WITKIN (caustically) You here You didnt waste much time

CORSO Hello Witkin Theres a small fortune in there (smiles
sardonically) Help yourself
WITKIN (eyes CORSOs beg suspiciously) Youre a vulture Corso
CORSO Who isnt in our business
WITKIN Youd stoop to anything

CORSO brushes past him into the elevator turns and pats his
shoulder bag

CORSO For a Quixote by Ybarra You bet I would

WITKIN (indignantly) Unscrupulous thoroughly unscrupulous
CORSO (thumbs the elevator button) Good hunting

The doors close on WITKINs indignant face

5 BERNIES BOOKSTORE EXTINTDAY

A sign says CLOSED CORSO pushes open the door of an old
fashioned semibasement bookstore -- BERNIES RARE BOOKS -- and
enters He walks up to the counter and deposits his bag on it
BERNIE (0S) Witkin just called me Hes spitting blood

CORSO looks around The voice came from ten feet up and three
bookcases along BERNIE FELDMAN a man around CORSOs age with
dark curly hair receding at the temples is perched at the top
of a spiral staircase

CORSO Whats his problem

BERNIE (replacing some books) He says youre a double-dealing
money grubbing bastard He says he had that sale tied up and now
youve queered his pitch

CORSO (grins to himself) He should be quicker off the mark

The spiral staircase judders as BERNIE starts to descend

CORSO goes over to a wall cupboard and opens it An assortment of
bottles and glasses come to light

CORSO (cont) May I
BERNIE Your valuation was way over the odds its brought those
people out In a rash Theyre now asking twice what the books are

worth

CORSO still grinning pours himself a slug of Scotch BERNIE
reaches the ground

BERNIE (cont) Hes talking about suing you Well lets face
it you screwed him Thats what its called

CORSO I know what its called
BERNIE comes up close
BERNIE He also says you snaffled the Don Qui

He breaks off as CORSO produces the four volumes of the
Quixote bends over to examine them whistles appreciatively

BERNIE (cont) The Ybarra Don Quixote 1780 four volumes
Fantastic (opens one) Sonofabitch youre the best in the

business Definitely

CORSO And the most expensive (smiles slyly) That client of
yours the Swiss is he still interested in this edition

BERNIE smiles back then redirects his attention to the books

BERNIE Sure but Witkin will blow a fuse I told him I had
nothing to do with this operation

CORSO knocks back his Scotch in one Extracting a crumpled
cigarette from the pocket of his overcoat he sticks it in his
mouth and lights it

CORSO Nothing except your ten percent

BERNIE Twenty The Swiss is my client remember

CORSO (shakes his head) No deal

BERNIE Fifteen (cynically) For my childrens sake

CORSO You dont have any

BERNIE Im still young Give me time

CORSO (expels a lungful of smoke unmoved) Ten

6 BALKAN BUILDING EXTDUSK

A taxi pulls up outside an opulent building downtown CORSO gets
out dodges a persistent beggar and enters The sign above the
entrance reads BALKAN PUBLICATIONS

7 BALKAN BUILDING LOBBY INTDUSK

CORSO nods to the SECURITY GUARD at the desk and makes hit way
across the lobby to a door at the back Beside it stands an
easel-mounted announcement Demons and Medieval Literature by
Boris Balkan PhD Its adorned with a medieval engraving
depicting an Inquisition torture scene

8 BALKAN BUILDING LECTURE ROOM INTDUSK

BORIS BALKAN standing at a state-of-the-art lecturers desk is

a bulky imposing figure of a man around 50 years old His thick
gray hair is slicked back to reveal a domed forehead The eyes
beneath it radiate keen intelligence through a pair of heavy
hornrims He speaks in a deep slow almost monotonous voice but
with great authority

BALKAN Relevant information may be found in Antoine Martin del

Rios Disquisitionum Magicarum Louvain 1599 and earlier in

1580 in De la dmonomanle des sorciers by the Frenchman Jean
Bodin

His eyes flicker in the direction of the door as CORSO enters

CORSOs entrance has also been noted by a GIRL in jeans and white
sneakers childlike face short hair and green feline eyes

He sits down in the same row but on the other side of the aisle
settles himself in his chair and scans the AUDIENCE most of whom
are middle-aged and female He gives the GIRL a cursory glance
then concentrates on BALKAN

BALKAN (cont) Bodin was probably the first to attempt to
establish a system - if the term system may be applied to the
Middle Ages - for classifying the contemporary perceptions of
evil In Bodin we find one of the first definitions of the word
witch I quote (cocks his head for a better look at the text)
A witch is a person who though cognizant of the laws of God
endeavors to act through the medium of a pact with the Devil

As BALKANs lecture proceeds CORSOs eyelids begin to droop We
PAN over the faces of the AUDIENCE (THE GIRL is still covertly
observing CORSO) BALKANs voice drones on fades away

9 BALKAN BUILDING LECTURE ROOM INTNIGHT

CLOSE on CORSO fast asleep

BALKAN (OS) I see you enjoyed my little talk Mr Corso
CORSO gives a start and opens his eyes He takes a moment or two
to focus on BALKAN whos standing over him Peering around
through his steel-rimmed glasses he sees that the lecture is
over The last of the AUDIENCE are filing out We glimpse THE
GIRL making her exit

CORSO Did I snore

BALKAN Nice of you to ask No not that I noticed Shall we go

He gestures at the door with a cold and impassive air CORSO gets
to his feet

10 BALKAN BUILDING LOBBY INTNIGHT
BALKAN walks swiftly across the lobby to the elevators with CORSO
at his heels They leave behind a buzz of conversation from

members of the AUDIENCE who are still discussing the lecture

BALKAN Dont you sleep nights
CORSO Like a baby

BALKAN Strange Id have bet a brace of Gutenberg Bibles you
spend half the night with your eyes peeled Youre one of those
lean hungry restless types that put the wind up Julius Caesar -
men whod stab their friends in the back

They reach the elevator BALKAN presses a button and turns to
CORSO who yawns

BALKAN (cont) Not I suspect that you have many friends do
you Mr Corso Your kind seldom does

CORSO (calmly) Go to hell

BALKAN is unruffled by CORSOs discourtesy The elevator doors
open He stands aside to let CORSO pass then follows him in

11 BALKAN BUILDING ELEVATOR INTNIGHT

BALKAN punches a code number on the elevators digital keyboard
With a subdued hiss the elevator starts to ascend

BALKAN Youre right of course Your friendships dont concern
me in the least Our relations have always been strictly
commercial isnt that so Theres no one more reliable than a
man whose loyalty can be bought for hard cash

CORSO Hey Balkan I came here to do some business not shoot
the breeze You want to expound your personal philosophy write
another book

BALKAN You dont like me do you

CORSO (shrugs) I dont have to like you Youre a client and
you pay well

The elevator reaches its destination the doors open
12 BALKAN BUILDING COLLECTION INTNIGHT

The elevator opens straight into a spacious room faced with black
marble The walls are bare save for a big back-lighted
photograph of a ruined castle overlooking a desolate valley

Two huge windows in the right-hand wall extend from floor to
ceiling Visible outside on the buildings floodlit facade
gargoyles gaze out over the city with their monstrous heads
propped on their claws

The centre of the room is occupied by a rectangular block of
tinted glass resembling a big black monolith Vaguely discernible
through the glass are shelves filled with antique books in
exquisite bindings

BALKAN leads CORSO over to the monolith He gestures at it
proudly soliciting admiration
BALKAN Well
CORSO Yup

BALKAN Youre privileged Corso Very few people have ever set
foot in here This Is my private collection Some bibliophiles
specialize in Gothic novels others in Books of Hours All my own
rare editions have the same protagonist the Devil

CORSO is impressed but does his best not to show it
CORSO May I take a look
BALKAN Thats why I brought you here

He goes over to the monolith and punches a keyboard on a
control panel gestures to CORSO to come closer

CORSO puts out his hand Before he can touch the glass it glides
aside with a faint hum He adjusts his glasses and glances at
BALKAN who looks on calmly His eyes roam along the spines of
the books BALKAN comes and stands beside him

ALKAN (cont) Beautiful arent they That soft sheen that
uperb gilding Not to mention the centuries of wisdom they
ontain -- centuries of erudition of delving Into the secrets of
e Universe and the hearts of men I know people who would

ill for a collection like this (CORSO shoots him a quick

lance) The Ars Diavoli Youll never see as many books on the
ubject anywhere else in the world Theyre the rarest the
oicest editions in existence It has taken me a lifetime to
assemble them Only the supreme masterpiece was missing Come

QanQqgwataunw

He has accompanied CORSO on his tour of the collection They come
to the end of the monolith Gesturing to CORSO to follow him
BALKAN goes over to an ultramodern brushed steel lectern
standing beside one of the huge picture windows

As he approaches the lectern CORSO briefly glimpses the sheer
drop beyond the window the twinkling lights of traffic passing
in the street far below

Reposing on the lectern is a black book adorned with a gold
pentagram CORSO opens it at the title page which displays the
title in Latin and a pictorial engraving

CORSO (not looking at BALKAN) The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of
Shadows

BALKAN Youre familiar with it
CORSO Sure Venice 1623 The author and printer was Aristide

Torchia burned by the Holy Inquisition together with all his
works Only three copies survived
BALKAN One

CORSO The catalogs list three copies surviving in private
ownership the Fargas the Kessler and the Telfer

BALKAN True Youve done your homework but youre wrong
nonetheless According to all the sources I myself have
consulted only one is authentic The author confessed under
torture that hed hidden one copy Only one

CORSO Well three are known

BALKAN Thats the trouble

CORSO resumes his inspection of the book

CORSO Where did you get it

BALKAN I bought it from Telfer

CORSO (surprised) Telfer

BALKAN (looking out the window) Yes he finally sold it to me
The day before he killed himself

CORSO Good timing

BALKAN ignores this CORSO turns the pages with care He lingers
over AN ENGRAVING OF A KNIGHT IN ARMOR RIDING TOWARD A CASTLE
WITH A FINGER TO HIS LIPS as though enjoining the reader to
silence Below it is a caption BALKAN draws closer and reads
over CORSOs shoulder

BALKAN Nemo pervenit qui non legitime certaverit

CORSO You only succeed if you fight by the rules

BALKAN More or less Ever heard of the Delomelanicon

CORSO Heard of it yes A myth isnt it Some horrific book
reputed to have been written by Satan himself

BALKAN No myth That book existed Torchia actually acquired it

He returns to the window overlooking the sheer drop Gazing down
he goes on

BALKAN (cont) The engravings youre now admiring were adapted
by Torchia from the Delomelanicon Theyre a form of satanic
riddle Correctly interpreted with the aid of the original text
and sufficient inside information theyre reputed to conjure up
the Prince of Darkness in person

CORSO You dont say

He continues to turn the pages
BALKAN Are you a religious man Corso I mean do you believe in
the supernatural

CORSO I believe in my percentage I also believe that books grow
old and decay like the rest of us Dont you get dizzy

standing there

BALKAN continues to stare down at the nocturnal cityscape CORSO
changes tack

CORSO (cont) What the hell do you want from me Balkan

BALKAN leaves the window and confronts him

BALKAN I want you to go to Europe and play the detective The
other two copies are in Portugal and France You must find some
way of comparing them with mine every page every engraving the
binding - everything Im convinced that only one can be
authentic and I want to know which one it is

CORSO Could be an expensive trip

BALKAN takes a folded check from his pocket and hands it to
CORSO who slips it into his breast pocket unexamined

BALKAN Thats to get you started Spend what you need

CORSO What if I find your copys a forgery

BALKAN stares at him coldly for a moment

BALKAN Its quite on the cards

CORSO seems mildly surprised He looks at the book again
listens to the quality of the paper by putting his ear to the

pages and riffling them with his thumb

CORSO Really It doesnt appear to be Even the paper sounds
kosher

BALKAN Even so There may be something wrong with it
CORSO continues to examine the book He smiles ironically
CORSO You mean the Devil wont show up

He shuts the book and replaces it on the lectern

BALKAN Dont be flippant (quotes) There are more things in
heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy

CORSO Hamlet believed in ghosts not demons
BALKAN If all three copies turn out to be bogus or incomplete

your work will be done If one of them proves to be genuine on
the other hand Ill finance you further
CORSO stares at him then unfolds the check and glances at the
amount - a substantial sum from the way he raises his eyebrows

BALKAN (cont) 1 shall want you to get it for me at all costs
never mind how

CORSO Never mind how sounds illegal

BALKAN It wouldnt be the first time youve done something
illegal

CORSO Not that illegal

BALKAN Hence the size of the check Do a good job and Ill
double it

He picks up The Nine Gates and holds it out After a moments
hesitation CORSO replaces the check in his pocket and takes the
book

BALKAN (cont) Be careful Corso

CORSO What do you mean (indicates the book) With this
BALKAN Just be careful

13 CORSOS APARTMENT INTNIGHT

A diminutive kitchenette CORSO one hand wrapped around a
Scotch uses the other to remove a TV dinner from the freezer
compartment of his refrigerator and insert it in a microwave He
shuts the door sets the timer and strolls out into the living
room

A bleak bachelor pad no pictures ornaments or photographs just
books on every available shelf and surface Against one wall a
desk with a computer on it On the floor beside the desk CORSOs
shabby canvas bag On the desk itself The Nine Gates

CORSO goes over to the desk He stares down at the book for a
long moment meditatively sipping his Scotch Then without
putting his glass down he opens the book one-handed and idly
turns a few pages pauses at THE ENGRAVING OF THE KNIGHT IN ARMOR
RIDING TOWARD THE CASTLE

We slowly MOVE IN until the screen is filled with an INSERT of
the knight with his finger enigmatically raised to his lips

14 TELFER HOUSE SITTING ROOM LIBRARY INTDAY

CORSO canvas bag on shoulder is standing in the middle of a
luxuriously furnished sitting room The decor which includes a
smiling portrait of Andrew Telfer is extremely opulent

CORSO is looking up at the portrait when the door opens He turns
to see LIANA TELFER on the threshold with a business card in her
hand His appreciation of her looks is evident
LIANA (whose photoportralt we saw in Scene 1) is a very sexy
thirtyish blonde with milky skin and a figure whose generous
curves are far from concealed by her ultra chic black costume
She gives CORSO the once-over then enters closing the door
behind her

CORSO Mrs Telfer (gestures at the business card) Bob Corso
Sorry to trouble you at a time like this

LIANA comes over and sits down on a sofa simultaneously
motioning CORSO into the armchair that faces it over a coffee
table She puts his card down crosses her lovely legs and
waits

CORSO sits down with his beg between his feet Opening it he
produces The Nine Gates LIANA involuntarily stiffens at sight
of it

CORSO (cont) It would be very helpful maam if you could tell
me what you know about this book

He holds it out After a momentary pause LIANA slowly reaches
for the book opens it at random turns a page or two She speaks
with a slight French accent

LIANA (casually) Isnt this one of my husbands books

CORSO Right It was in his collection until very recently He
sold it to a client of mine Im trying to authenticate it

LIANA He sold it you say How strange It was one of his most
treasured possessions

CORSO He never mentioned the sale

LIANA is fractionally late in answering CORSO spots her
hesitation

LIANA No Its news to me Who bought it

CORSO A private collector

LIANA May I know his name

CORSO Im afraid thats confidential

LIANA I suppose he has a bill of sale

CORSO No problem there

LIANA Is this your job authenticating rare books
CORSO And tracking them down

LIANA (smiles) Youre a book detective
CORSO (smiles back) Kind of (pause) Do you recall when and
where your husband acquired this book

LIANA In Spain We were vacationing at Toledo Andrew got very
excited -- paid a great deal of money for it He was a fanatical
collector

CORSO So I gather

LIANA deposits The Nine Gates on the coffee table and rises
LIANA Ill show you

CORSO rises likewise Then a thought strikes him swiftly
retrieving The Nine Gates and his bag he stows one in the
other as he follows her undulating hips to a door at the far end
of the room which she opens

LIANA (cont) Look

She walks on ahead into the library in which Andrew Telfer hanged
himself CORSO is still eyeing her delectable rear view

CORSO Magnificent

Reluctantly he drags his eyes away from LIANA and surveys the
crowded shelves

CORSO (cont) Really magnificent

He goes over to inspect the bookshelves In passing he glances up
at the chandelier which is still hanging slightly askew

LIANA Andrew used to spend many hours in hereToo many
CORSO Did he ever try it out

He asks the question with an air of spurious innocence looking
around the room as he does so LIANA frowns

LIANA I dont understand

CORSO (cont) The book -- did he ever use it to perform some
kind of ritual intended to well produce a supernatural
effect

LIANA Are you serious

CORSO Absolutely

LIANA A Black Mass you mean

CORSO More or less An attempt to conjure up the Devil

LIANA Andrew was a trifle eccentric Mr Corso but he wasnt
insane
She gives a mournful shrug every inch the recent widow

LIANA (cont) Its true hed been acting strangely those last
few days He shut himself up in here -- seldom emerged except for
meals

She draws a deep breath glances at the chandelier

LIANA (cont) That morning I was woken by the screams of the
maid hed hanged himself (pauses looks at CORSO) Whatever he
was up to I certainly cant see him chanting mumbo-jumbo or
trying to raise the dead

The flippant tone of the last few words sounds rather forced
CORSO smiles at her faintly over his glasses pats his shoulder
bag

CORSO The Devil Mrs Telfer This book is designed to raise the
Devil

15 TELFER HOUSE EXTDAY

CORSO crosses the forecourt to the street A man with a MUSTACHE
and a scarred face is leaning against a limo parked outside the
house smoking a small cigar They eye each other briefly

CORSO reaches the sidewalk just as a cab sails past He raises
his hand too late to flag it down looks around for another

The MUSTACHEs cellphone beeps He reaches into the limo and
picks up the receiver

16 REFERENCE LIBRARY INTDAY

The big reference library is divided up by freestanding
bookshelves and has a gallery running around it at second-floor
level NUMEROUS READERS are occupying the rows of tables in the
central area

CORSO is seated at one of the tables with the Nine Gates in
front of him Beside it reposes a large catalog and his notebook
The Nine Gates is open at the frontispiece which displays the
title - De Umbrarum Regni Novem Portis- and the words Sic
Luceat Lux separated by an emblem consisting of A TREE ENCIRCLED
BY A SNAKE DEVOURING ITS OWN TAIL

As we MOVE IN ON THE COILED SNAKE we hear CORSO translating to
himself in a low voice

CORSO (OS) Sic Luceat Lux Thus let the light
shine

17 REFERENCE LIBRARY INTDUSK

Many of the tables are now deserted and the shaded reading
lights have been switched on
CORSO shuts a catalog and gets up to replace It in the wall of
books behind his chair runs his finger along a shelf till he
comes to another fat tome and removes it Hes startled to see
framed in the resulting gap the face of THE GIRL at Balkans
lecture short hair green feline eyes The face recedes and
disappears

CORSO quickly rounds the end of the bookshelf no sign of her He
looks both ways but the aisles are deserted Puzzled he resumes
his seat and opens the second catalog Then sensing that hes
being watched he swings around

Nothing outwardly suspicious just two BESPECTACLED STUDENTS
comparing notes In sibilant whispers He looks right a
scattering of READERS He scans the reading-room at large still
nothing untoward

He turns some pages in The Nine Gates comes to AN ENGRAVING OF
A NAKED WOMAN RIDING A SEVEN-HEADED DRAGON WITH A CASTLE ABLAZE
IN THE BACKGROUND He consults the second catalog which displays
a small reproduction of the same scene with text wrapped around
it and jots something down in his notebook

Wearily he straightens and stretches removes his glasses
pinches the bridge of his nose As he Idly scans the reading
room his astigmatic vision gives him an unfocused glimpse of THE
GIRL looking down at him from the gallery overhead By the time
he replaces his glasses shes gone

18 CORSOS APARTMENT HOUSE EXTINIGHT

Its raining hard CORSO trudges up the steps of his brownstone
with the canvas bag on his shoulder and a bag of groceries In his
arms

19 ELEVATOR INTNIGHT
CORSO rides the elevator up
20 CORSOS APARTMENT HOUSE PASSAGE APARTMENT INTNIGHT

CORSO emerges from the elevator and walks down the passage to his
door He inserts his key in the mortice lock and tries to turn
it Nothing doing Its unlocked already

Next he inserts his key in the second lock and turns it Not
being double-locked the door opens at once It takes hima
moment to digest the significance of this fact

Just then he hears a muffled crash from inside the apartment a
window has been flung open in a hurry He bursts into the living
room No one there but the light is on Dropping his shoulder
bag and groceries he dashes into the bedroom

The window is open and the curtains are billowing out into the
room CORSO darts to the window flings one leg over the sill and
climbs out on the fire escape
21 FIRE ESCAPE SIDE STREET EXTNIGHT

Feet can be heard clattering down the fire escape CORSO peers
over the rail just in time to see a DARK FIGURE emerge into the
side street beneath him and sprint off through the rain

CORSO (yells half-heartedly) Hey you

He gives up and climbs back inside

22 CORSOS APARTMENT INTNIGHT

CORSO scans the living room The only immediate sign of the
intruders presence is that the chair has been pulled away from
the desk and one of the drawers is open

CORSO pushes the chair back into place and shuts the drawer

23 BERNIES BOOKSTORE INTDAY

ON The Nine Gates lying open on BERNIEs desk Hes reverently
turning the pages with CORSO at his elbow

BERNIE Son of a bitch Where did you get this

CORSO Balkan He wants me to research it

BERNIE Balkan owns a Nine Gates

CORSO Recently acquired from the late lamented Andrew Telfer

BERNIE Trust Balkan What does he need you for I dont suppose

BERNIE Compare it
CORSO Yeah Only one of the three is authentic he says

BERNIE Well this one looks genuine enough Must be worth a
million Jesus Take good care of it

CORSO Thats why Im here I need you to stash it for me Im

BERNIE stares at him

BERNIE Like what

CORSO Uninvited visitors unfamiliar faces I dont trust

it I dont even trust you

BERNIE registers a mixture of affection and cynicism
BERNIE Thats mean buddy You know Id never screw you without
a damn good reason money women business Anything else you

CORSO taps the book with his forefinger

CORSO Youll answer for this with your balls Bernie

BERNIE (still engrossed) Sure man sure You can castrate me
personally

CORSO Ill pick it up on my way to the airport
BERNIE No problem

He continues to pore over the book turns another page reads
aloud

BERNIE (cont) Virtue lies vanquished huh These engravings
are terrific

CORSO (leans over his shoulder) Or horrific whichever

BERNIE nods absently He smiles to himself with an air of
enchantment

BERNIE (cont) Beautiful just beautiful

Visible through the bookstores semi-basement windows the legs
of PASSERSBY accelerate as they scurry past it has started to
rain A pair of MANS LEGS in dark slacks come to a halt The
butt of a small cigar falls to the sidewalk the LEGS walk on
Two WHITE SNEAKERS come into view They step on the butt and
extinguish it

24 CORSOS APARTMENT INTNIGHT

CORSO is in the bedroom packing some articles of clothing and
toiletries in a small Samsonlte suitcase lying open on the bed

The doorbell rings Fractionally startled CORSO straightens up
dumps a handful of socks on the bed and goes out into the lobby
He peers through the spyhole LIANA TELFER is standing outside
CORSO pauses for a moment thinking hard then opens the door
LIANA May I come in

CORSO rather bemused steps aside and ushers her in

CORSO This way

He shows her Into the living room LIANA starts to unbutton her
coat

CORSO (cont) Allow me
He helps her off with her coat and drapes it neatly over a chair
Shes dressed to kill In a black lowcut cocktail gown

LIANA Thank you
CORSO Sit down wont you

LIANA sinks gracefully onto the sofa taking in the decor of his
bachelor apartment as she does so

LIANA Ive come to talk business
CORSO Great Everyones talking business to me lately

LIANA takes a slim gold cigarette case from her purse extracts a
black Russian and lights it with a gold Dupont Meantime

LIANA Yesterday when you came to see me about that book I was
too surprised to react as I should have done I mean it really
was one of Andrews favorites
CORSO So you said

LIANA Id like to get it bac

CORSO That could be a problem

LIANA Not necessarily it all depends
CORSO On what
LIANA On you

CORSO stares at her absorbing the lines of her figure the slim
legs sheathed in sheer black silk stockings

CORSO I dont understand Mrs Telfer The book isnt mine to
dispose of

She sits back showing off her superb legs to even better
advantage

LIANA You work for money I take it
CORSO What else

LIANA I have a great deal of money
CORSO Im happy for you

LIANA You could stage a theft Im sure your client is well
insured

CORSO Im a professional maam

LIANA Youre a professional mercenary Mercenaries work for the
highest bidder

CORSO I make a living

LIANA (huskily) I could throw in a bonus

CORSO This has happened before someplace

LIANA I know In the movies

CORSO And she had an automatic in her stocking top

CORSO watches mesmerized as she slowly very slowly slides her
skirt up her thighs to reveal the creamy flesh between her
stocking tops and black lace garter belt

LIANA No automatic

Just as slowly she smooths her skirt down over her thighs
CORSO swallows hard He rises and goes to his drinks corner a
shelf with an array of bottles and glasses on it Over his
shoulder

CORSO Want one

LIANA Why not

CORSO splashes some Scotch into two tumblers and carries them
over to her

LIANA sits motionless for an instant looking up at him Then
very slowly she stubs out her cigarette extends the same hand
and fondles his crotch

CORSO with the tumblers encumbering both his hands can only
stand there like a bird hypnotized by a snake His Adams apple
bobs some more

Holding his gaze LIANA withdraws her hand and rises Theyre
only inches apart now She takes one of the tumblers and clinks
it against CORSOS then drains it CORSO in a kind of trance
does likewise

Very deliberately LIANA relieves him of his glass and puts it
down on the table with hers Then cupping his face between her
hands she proceeds to eat him alive

CORSO responds Re pulls up her skirt she reaches for his zipper
and yanks at it He bears her backward and downward onto the
sofa Their bodies coalesce into a heaving mass The gown slips
down over

LIANAs left shoulder revealing a small tattoo in the shape of a
snake devouring its own tail

25 CORSOS APARTMENT INTNIGHT
ON LIANAs hand reaching across the floor for Corsos canvas bag
it gropes in the bag then inverts it spilling the contents a
couple of packs of Luckies a notebook an envelope full of
bills a Swiss Army knife an experts magnifying glass some
pencils etc

We discover CORSO and LIANA on the floor their clothing
dishevelled CORSO is lying back still panting and sweating from
his exertions LIANA is sitting up

LIANA Well where is it

CORSO Wheres what

LIANA Dont fuck with me Corso

CORSO I thought thats what we were doing

LIANAs eyes narrow Then with an animal cry she goes for his
face with her nails and teeth

CORSO turns his head away just in time and scrambles to his feet
pulling up his trousers LIANA beside herself with fury flies
at him with both hands extended like claws

He manages to grab her wrists and immobilize them so she sinks
her teeth in his chest

With an agonized yell CORSO releases her wrists clasps his
chest and staggers back - hardly a dignified proceeding because
hes hobbled by the trousers that have slumped around his ankles

LIANA looks around wildly for a weapon of some kind catches
sight of the Scotch bottle and seizes it by the neck

CORSO one hand holding his trousers at half mast the other
raised in supplication comes shuffling toward her

CORSO Hey look be reasonable

Unmoved LIANA raises the bottle and smashes it over his head
26 CORSOS APARTMENT INTNIGHT

CORSO recovers consciousness gingerly feels his aching head
Some blood has trickled down his face He surveys the room which

is in chaos and has obviously been ransacked

He goes into the bathroom and inspects himself in the mirror
takes a hand towel and gingerly dabs his scalp

Holding the towel to his head he returns to the living room
where he picks up the phone and punches out a number We hear a

recorded announcement

BERNIE (VO) Hi this is Bernies Rare Books Im not available
right now If you want to leave a message please speak after the
beep

CORSO (into phone) Bernie you there Bernie Pick up

No response He replaces the receiver

27 BERNIES BOOKSTORE EXTNIGHT

CORSO bag on shoulder is lurking in a doorway across the street
from the bookstore The place looks silent and deserted but a

dim glow indicates that a light must be on somewhere inside

CORSO quits the doorway and hurries across the street He walks
down the steps to the door and tries the handle The door opens

28 BERNIES BOOKSTORE INTNIGHT

Only Bernies desk light is on No sign of Bernle himself CORSO
listens intently looks up at the top of the spiral staircase
which is in shadow calls in a low voice

CORSO Bernie

No response He listens some more nothing but the sound of a
passing car

He makes his way cautiously along the bookcases and rounds a
corner then stops short with a look of horror on his face

BERNIE has been lashed upside down to the handrail of the spiral
staircase His mouth and eyes are open and his battered face is
streaked with blood

CORSO (cont) Jesus Christ

He puts out a hand toward BERNIE but the man is so obviously
dead that he withdraws it He looks around in an involuntary
apprehensive way Then satisfied that hes alone he starts to
climb the staircase Once past BERNIEs corpse which he
studiously avoids touching he climbs faster The staircase
creaks and sways

Reaching the third tier of bookshelves he presses a hidden
button With a faint click a panel springs open to disclose a

recess filled with books

CORSO expels a deep breath There it is safe and sound The
Nine Gates He looks down at BERNIE

CORSO Thanks man Im sorry
29 AIRLINER INTDAY

CORSO ensconced in a window seat is moodily gazing out at some
passing cloud-castles The sun is setting
30 SPANISH AIRPORT INTNIGHT

The brightly illuminated arrivals hall is thronged with
PASSENGERS in transit

COPSO wearing his overcoat and carrying his suitcase threads
his way through them with the canvas bag on his shoulder Weary
and unshaven he stares straight ahead with an abstracted
expression adjusts his glasses

31 TOLEDO STREET ALLEYWAY EXTDAY

CORSOs footsteps echo as he walks bag on shoulder along one of
Toledos narrow medieval streets Very few people to be seen The
sun is shining brightly but theres a strong wind blowing

Rounding a corner CORSO heads down an alleyway flanked by
scaffolding swathed in protective netting and blue tarpaulins
its completely deserted No sound but that of canvas billowing
in the wind like a ships sails He consults a street sign turns
another corner

He reaches a doorway leading to an inner courtyard bumps into a
BOY who comes running out We hear the strident cries of a woman

BOY S si mama

A flight of steps in one corner of the courtyard leads down to
the basement CORSO descends them and stops outside a door A
grimy window beside it serves to display some old books and
religious prints The sign on the door reads HERMANOS CENIZA
RESTAURACION DE LIBROS Below it On parle Frantais and
English spoken CORSO opens the door which creaks

32 CENIZA BROS WORKSHOP INTDAY

CORSO enters A gaunt bent-backed old man (PEDRO CENIZA) with a
pair of glasses perched on the end of his big nose looks up from
an old hand press Everything about him is as gray as the
cigarette ash that rains down on his clothes and the books hes
working on Hes a chain-smoker

PEDRO Senor

CORSO Buenas tardes

PEDRO Buenes tardes

PABLO (0S) Buenas tardes

CORSO turns to see another old man (PABLO CENIZA) surface from
behind some stacks of paper His resemblance to PEDRO - bent
back big nose spectacles - is such that they can only be twins
PABLO wipes his inky hand on a rag before shaking CORSOS PEDRO

follows suit

CORSO hesitates briefly taken aback by this dual apparition
PEDRO and PABLO look him up and down with their keen twinkling
little eyes Their movements are slow and serene their
expression carries a hint of mockery and they often exchange
knowing smiles Theyre so in sync that they communicate by means
of glances and finish off each others sentences

CORSO You speak English

They nod simultaneously He produces The Nine Gates from his
shoulder bag

CORSO (cont) Id appreciate your opinion on this

PEDRO takes the book with tremulous hands PABLO quickly clears
away some parchments on the workbench to make room for it

Some ash from PEDROs cigarette falls on the cover
PABLO clicks his tongue and blows it off

PABLO (reprovingly) What a habit for a bookbinder (smiles at
CORSO) The Nine Gates A superb edition Very rare

PEDRO (opens it) The Telfer copy
CORSO You used to own it right
PEDRO We used to yes

PABLO We sold it

PEDRO We sold it when the opportunity presented itself it was
too

PABLO too good to miss An excellent sale
PEDRO An excellent buy - impeccable condition
PABLO Impeccable You are the present owner
CORSO A client of mine

PABLO (over his glasses) I would never have believed she would
part with it

CORSO She

PABLO (without looking up) Senora Telfer

CORSO reaches into his overcoat pocket and extracts a crumpled
cigarette Hes raising it to his lips when he stops short
produces the equally crumpled pack and offers it to PEDRO who
has just discarded his butt

PEDRO helps himself to a Lucky breaks off the filter and jams it
in his mouth CORSO lights both of them
CORSO 1 understood it was Mr Telfer that bought it
PABLO He paid for it

PEDRO It was the senora who made him buy it He did not seem
particularly (glances at PABLO)

PABLO interested

PEDRO has finished examining the text He looks at the spine
PEDRO A superb specimen

CORSO (hesitates briefly) Could it be a forgery

PEDRO (suspiciously almost indignantly) A forgery (turns to
PABLO) You heard that Pablo

PABLO wags his finger reprovingly in CORSOs face

PABLO I took you for a professional senor You speak too
lightly of forgeries

PEDRO Far too lightly
PABLO Forging a book is expensive Paper of the period the
right inks (makes a dismissive gesture) Too expensive to be

profitable

PEDRO and PABLO assess the effect of their words on CORSO who
digests them

CORSO Im aware of all that but could some part of it be
forged Restorers have been known to replace missing pages with
pages taken from another copy of the same edition Have you never
done that yourselves

The old men look at each other then turn to CORSO
simultaneously PEDRO looking flattered nods

PEDRO Of course it can be done

PABLO It requires great skill naturally but yes it can be
done

CORSO Couldnt that be the case here
PABLO What makes you ask

CORSO My client wishes to satisfy himself of the books
authenticity

The brothers eye each other over their glasses CORSO adjusts his
own

CORSO (cont) His name is Balkan Boris Balkan of New York
PABLO and PEDRO exchange another glance CORSO detects the hint
of a smile that passes between them

PEDRO All books have a destiny of their own

PABLO Even a life of their own Senor Balkan is a noted
bibliophile Hes no fool He must know this book is authentic

PEDRO We know it

PABLO So must he

PEDRO This book was with us for years

PABLO Many years

PEDRO We had ample opportunity to examine it thoroughly The
printing and binding are superb examples of 17th century Venetian
craftsmanship

He picks up the book and riffles the pages under CORSOs nose

PEDRO (cont) Finest rag paper resistant to the passage of
time None of your modern wood pulp

PABLO Watermarks identical shades ink type faces If this
is a forgery or a copy with pages restored its the work of a
master

PEDRO A master

CORSO contemplates the brothers with a smile

CORSO Did you study the engravings They seem to form a kind of
riddle

PEDRO and PABLO reopen the book and look at the engravings

PABLO Well yes (another glance at PEDRO) Books of this type
often contain little puzzles

PEDRO Especially in the case of such an illustrious
collaborator

CORSO looks at PEDRO with sudden interest then at the book then
back at PEDRO

CORSO Collaborator
PEDRO shrugs PABLO refocuses on CORSO

PEDRO You cannot have proceeded very far with your research
Come look closely

He takes a magnifying glass and holds it over one of the
engravings which shows A HERMIT WITH TWO KEYS IN HIS HAND AND A
DOG AND A LANTERN BESIDE HIM
A microscopic inscription can be detected in the bottom right
corner

CORSO bends over it looking mystified PEDRO grows impatient

PEDRO (cont) Dont you see Only seven of the engravings were
signed by Aristide Torchia

CORSO And the other two

PEDRO This is one of them Look

CORSO peers through the magnifying glass once more
We see the INSERT Invenit LF

CORSO LF Whos that

PEDRO Think

CORSO Lucifer

PEDRO and PABLO chuckle heartily

PEDRO Youre a clever man senor Torchia was not alone when
they burned him alive

CORSO But thats absurd You dont honestly believe

PEDRO The man who wrote this did so in alliance with the Devil
and went to the stake for it Even Hell has its heroes senor

CORSO looks from one to the other trying to figure this out
33 TOLEDO ALLEYWAY EXTDAY

CORSO walks back along the narrow alleyway with the canvas-—
covered scaffolding He glances over his shoulder Not a soul in
sight The blue canvas flaps in the wind the scaffolding creaks
and groans He walks on

He hears a sudden rending sound looks back and up

Theres little time to react the scaffolding has come away from
its mountings its starting to buckle and fall out into the
street

Desperately he breaks into a run Behind him collapsing like a
house of cards the mass of canvas and metal gains on him as he
sprints for the end of the alley summoning up all his energy for
a final burst

The last of the scaffolding hits the ground only inches behind
him He looks back at the tangled mass that has only just failed
to engulf him
34 TRAIN EXTNIGHT
A train speeds through the darkness
35 TRAIN DINING CAR INTNIGHT

The dining car is deserted save for CORSO and a STEWARD who is
lolling against the kitchen bulkhead at the far end

CORSO with a coffee cup and a brandy glass at his elbow has
The Nine Gates lying open in front of him at THE ENGRAVING OF
THE HERMIT WITH THE KEYS DOG AND LANTERN Theres some
cigarette ash trapped between the pages Smiling faintly he
blows it away Then he reaches into his bag for his magnifying
glass pushes up his steel-rimmed specs and screws the glass
into his eye He examines the engraving at close range

We see again the INSERT of the inscription Invenit LF

CORSO straightens up and removes the glass from his eye He
finishes his brandy and beckons the STEWARD

36 TRAIN CORRIDOR INTNIGHT

The clickety-clack of wheels on tracks swells in volume as CORSO
bag on shoulder crosses the sliding floorplates that connect one
car to another

He enters the next corridor and stops short theres a lone
figure leaning against a window looking out its THE GIRL we
saw at Balkans lecture short dark hair catlike green eyes
slim athletic figure jeans and white sneakers

CORSO sets off along the corridor When he reaches her they eye
each others reflections in the windowpane

THE GIRL (softly) Hi

CORSO pauses to look at her unable to make up his mind
CORSO Ive seen you before havent I

THE GIRL Have you

CORSO Yes somewhere

A brief silence

THE GIRL Are you traveling in this car

CORSO The next one

THE GIRL The sleeper (smiles) I travel on the cheap
CORSO Are you a student

THE GIRL Something like that (looks out the window again) I
like trains

CORSO Me too Whats your name
THE GIRL Guess

CORSO (shrugs smiles) Greeneyes
THE GIRL Thatll do Whats yours
CORSO Corso

THE GIRL Strange name

CORSO Italian it means I run

THE GIRL You dont look like a runner to me - more the quiet
type

They look at each others reflections once more THE GIRLs gaze
is direct and unwavering CORSO terminates their encounter with a
diffident little nod

CORSO Well have a good trip

THE GIRL And you

CORSO walks on down the corridor Theres something weird about
this chance encounter but he cant figure out what

THE GIRL (cont) See you around maybe

CORSO pauses and looks back Shes still leaning against the
window staring out He nods

CORSO Maybe
37 SINTRA STATION EXTDAY
Its a damp gray morning A sign reads SINTRA

CORSO bag on shoulder and Samsonite suitcase in hand gets off
the train

38 QUINTA FARGAS GATEWAY EXTDAY

One of Sintras traditional horse-drawn carriages drops CORSO in
front of a massive gateway flanked by stone walls thick with ivy
Some birds peer down at him from a branch

The gateposts are surmounted by two mildew-covered female busts

in gray stone one of them with its face obscured by ivy CORSO

contemplates them for a moment then pushes open the gate which
squeaks protestingly Beyond it a neglected drive

39 QUINTA FARGAS DRIVEWAY GROUNDS EXTDAY
A gray desolate infinitely melancholy scene Dead leaves litter
a gravel driveway flanked by crumbling statues some of which
have toppled over onto the long-neglected weed-infested lawn
CORSOs muffled footsteps are the only sound

Near the house is a dried-up dilapidated fountain faced with
tiles and topped by a mouldering cherub The waters of the
ornamental pond beside it are dark as molasses and coated with
dead leaves and water lilies

The Quinta Fargas is a gloomy four-square 18th century mansion
CORSO walks up the steps and tugs the old-fashioned bellpull A
mournful jangling sound issues from the recesses of the house
CORSO waits glances at his watch

Echoing footsteps approach A sound of bolts being withdrawn and
the door opens to reveal VICTOR FARGAS Tall and emaciated as an
El Greco saint he has a drooping white mustache His baggy
trousers and oversized woollen sweater contrast with a pair of
old but immaculately polished shoes His appearance perfectly
matches his melancholy surroundings

FARGAS Yes

CORSO Bob Corso Mr Fargas (Puts out his hand) How do you do
FARGAS hesitates before shaking hands Then his face clears
FARGAS Corso ah yes Please come in

40 QUINTA FARGAS RECEPTION ROOMS DRAWING ROOM INTDAY

FARGAS who has a slight limp leads the way through two
reception rooms once imposing but now entirely bare and empty
By the dim light that filters through their dusty windows CORSO
observes the patches on the walls that indicate the former
location of paintings curtains pieces of furniture etc
FARGAS Home sweet home

He ushers CORSO into a large but sparsely furnished drawing room

FARGAS (cont) You wont say no to a brandy 1 take it

He goes over to a side table and pours some cognac into two fine
crystal glasses

CORSO meantime is surveying the room At the far end a huge
open fireplace Two ill-assorted armchairs a table a sideboard
some candlesticks a violin case - and books Theyre neatly
stacked on the floor and the few pieces of furniture CORSO has
just discovered them when FARGAS comes over with the glasses He
puts his bag down and takes one

CORSO Thanks (admiringly) Handsome glasses

FARGAS These are the only ones I have left
CORSO looks around the room
CORSO Must have been a beautiful place

FARGAS it was but old families are like ancient civilizations
they wither and die

He raises his glass in a silent toast CORSO reciprocates FARGAS
gestures at the books

FARGAS (cont) There they are eight hundred and thirty-four of
them A pity you didnt see them in better times in their
bookcases I used to have five thousand These are the survivors

CORSO runs his fingers caressingly over a book

CORSO So this is the Fargas collection Not quite as I imagined
it

FARGAS Cest la vie my friend But I keep them in perfect
condition safe from damp light heat and rats I dust and air
them every day its all I do do in fact

CORSO What happened to the rest

FARGAS Sacrificed in a good cause I had to sell them to
preserve the others Five or six books a year Almost all the
proceeds go to the state in taxes

CORSO Why dont you sell up

FARGAS Sell the Fargas family estate its obvious youre an
American my friend There are things you cant be expected to
understand

CORSO continues to survey the books fascinated

CORSO If you sold all these your financial problems would be
over (picks up a book and examines it) Look at this

Poliphilo for example a real gem

He replaces it FARGAS leans over and carefully adjusts the book
until its precisely in its original position

FARGAS I know but if I sold them all Id have no reason to go
on living More brandy

He heads for the bottle on the side table without waiting for a
reply

CORSO What about The Nine Gates
FARGAS (puzzled) What about it

CORSO Thats why Im here I told you on the phone
FARGAS The phone
Forgive me

Of course

(pause) Yes of course I remember now

The Nine Gates

thoughts

The shadows are lengthening FARGAS reverently turns the pages of
each book In turn caresses the yellowing paper with his
fingertips

FARGAS (cont) Look at this imperfection In the fourth line here
- the damaged S The same type the same impression

He turns both copies of The Nine Gates over to reveal their
backboards

FARGAS (cont) You see If it werent for this slight
discoloration on the back of my copy one couldnt tell them

apart

CORSO If its all right with you Id like to stay awhile and
study them in detail

FARGAS (eyes him keenly) What are you looking for Mr Corso
CORSO I wish I knew
FARGAS looks suddenly grave

FARGAS Some books are dangerous Not to be opened with impunity

CORSO (with equal gravity) Very true
41 QUINTA FARGAS DRAWING ROOM INTDUSK

A fire is burning on the hearth FARGAS seated at a window is
practicing the violin He repeats the same short piece over and
over again occasionally pausing to take a sip of brandy

CORSO Is sitting at a table with both copies of The Nine Gates
open in front of him at the engraving of THE KNIGHT WITH A FINGER
TO HIS LIPS CORSO compares the two copies with the aid of his
magnifying glass They look identical

CORSO turns over several pages in each book until he comes to THE
HERMIT WITH THE KEYS DOG AND LANTERN He compares the two
copies Again no apparent difference

He proceeds to a third engraving A WAYFARER APPROACHING A BRIDGE
WITH TWO GATE TOWERS AND AN ANGELIC ARCHER IN THE CLOUDS
OVERHEAD Another seemingly identical pair Then he stops short
and returns to the second engraving it looks the same but

Then he spots it in Balkans copy the keys are In the Hermits
right hand in Fargass copy In his left

Fascinated by this discovery CORSO peers closely at each
signature In turn Balkans reads AT Fargass LF

CORSO turns to an engraving of A JESTER OUTSIDE A MAZE WITH TWO
ENTRANCES Comparison of the two copies reveals that in Fargass
copy one of the doorways is open in Balkans its bricked up
The signatures too vary AT in one LF in the other

CORSO (excitedly under his breath) Now were getting somewhere

An old-fashioned telephone bell starts ringing in the bowels of
the house CORSO looks up

FARGAS doesnt hear the bell immediately He plays on for a bar
or two then pauses and listens with his head cocked The
telephone continues to ring His chair scrapes the floorboards as
he gets to his feet He puts the violin down and limps out

42 QUINTA FARGAS DRAWING ROOM INTNIGHT

CORSOs open notebook now displays a chart consisting of two
horizontal rows of nine boxes One row is marked BALKAN the
other FARGAS

CORSO is busy filling In the boxes with either AT or LF

FARGAS reappears He gives CORSO a friendly nod returns to the
window and launches Into the same old piece on his violin

CORSO has now filled in all the boxes He studies them for a
moment then rings all the LFs in red

43 QUINTA FARGAS GATEWAY ROAD EXTNIGHT

Under an owls vigilant gaze CORSO shuts the gate His breath Is
visible as steam In the chilly night air After a last backward
look at the statue-bordered driveway and the neglected garden he
turns up his overcoat collar settles his bag on his shoulder
and sets off down the road toward the lights of Sintra which are
visible in the distance His footsteps re-echo from the wall that
bounds the Fargas property

Then it happens he hasnt gone far when two headlights snap on
behind him Simultaneously the car starts up and takes off with
a squeal of tires

CORSO spins around He stands there transfixed for a moment then
dodges behind a projecting buttress as the car hurtles past
missing him by a whisker

The car a big dark sedan skids to a halt some twenty yards
away The driver s door opens and A TALL MAN gets out He
momentarily hesitates when he sees CORSO still on his feet

Just then we hear a motor vehicle - a noisy one - rounding the
next bend The TALL MAN is captured by a beam of light CORSO has
seen him before its the MUSTACHE

The MUSTACHE decides to beat it He dives back Into the car and
takes off fast

CORSO trembling with shock watches the tail lights recede and
disappear The sound of the approaching vehicle increases in
volume CORSO turns to stare at it

Wobbling unsteadily along the road comes a lone PEASANT astride a
ramshackle motorbike with a blown exhaust The PEASANT honks as
he goes by CORSO retrieves his bag from the roadside

44 SINTRA HOTEL EXTNIGHT

CORSO enters a small hotel

45 SINTRA HOTEL RECEPTION LOUNGE INTNIGHT

CORSO still looking pretty rocky collects his key from the
reception desk and sets off In the direction of the elevator

Visible in the background Is the hotel lounge TWO ELDERLY FEMALE
TOURISTS possibly retired English schoolmarms are quietly
conversing at one table while AN OVERWEIGHT GERMAN COUPLE sip
cocktails at another

CORSO idly scanning the lounge as he makes for the elevator
stops short a pair of legs In jeans and white sneakers are
jutting from an inglenook fireplace in the far corner He goes

over to investigate

THE GIRL Is snuggled up In an armchair with a book on her lap He
hesitates for a moment She looks up

CORSO Hi You didnt say you were bound for Sintra
THE GIRL Neither did you

CORSO What are you doing here

THE GIRL Reading

CORSO I can see that

THE GIRL And bumping into people unexpectedly
CORSO Unexpectedly is right

THE GIRL Are you on a business trip (indicates his shoulder
bag) Is that why you always carry that thing around

CORSO doesnt answer adjusts his glasses inquiringly at her
book

THE GIRL hands it to him We see the title The Devil in Love
by Jacques Cazotte

CORSO You like Gothic novels
THE GIRL I like books I never travel without one

CORSO Been traveling long
THE GIRL Ages

CORSO eyes her intrigued She uttered the word in the simple

natural way that characterizes all her behavior
CORSO You said you were a student

THE GIRL Did I (shrugs) So I am In a way

CORSO shakes his head and smiles Hes getting nowhere fast

THE HOTEL PORTER appears at his elbow

HOTEL PORTER Excuse me senhor Phone call
CORSO (surprised) For me Are you sure

HOTEL PORTER Sim senhor

He withdraws CORSO turns back to THE GIRL
CORSO Well sorry I disturbed you

He hands back the book and turns to go

46 SINTRA HOTEL PHONE BOOTH INTNIGHT

CORSO picks up the receiver with a puzzled frown
CORSO Yes

BALKAN (VO) Mr Corso

CORSO (startled) Balkan How did you find me
BALKAN (VO) Made any progress

CORSO Progress You could call it that

BALKAN (VO) Well

He gestures

CORSO Ive examined the Fargas copy its authentic At least it
looks that way Like yours But there are discrepancies

BALKAN (VO) Discrepancies

CORSO In the engravings Like keys in different hands doorways

open In one copy and bricked up In the other
BALKAN (VO) 1 see

CORSO And theres another thing

BALKAN (VO) Yes

CORSO The ones that differ are ail signed LF

Seems like some
kind of riddle

A long pause

CORSO (cont) Are you still there Where are you anyway
BALKAN (VO) I think youd better get it for me

CORSO The old man wouldnt sell it to save his life - he said as
much

Another long pause

CORSO (cont) Balkan

A click and the line goes dead

47 SINTRA HOTEL CORSOS ROOM INTDAWN

The curtains are drawn but theres light enough for us to see
CORSO lying fast asleep on his back in bed one limp arm trailing
over the edge

A knock at the door He grunts and props himself on one elbow

CORSO (sleepily) Just a minute

He rolls out of bed and wraps the bedspread around his waist
Then he opens the door and stands there a tousled figure with
Lianas teeth marks clearly visible on his chest THE GIRL is
outside

THE GIRL You left your phone off the hook

CORSO Jesus (peers blearily at his watch) What time is it
THE GIRL Early but you have to go

CORSO (bewildered) Go where for Gods sake

THE GIRL The Fargas place

CORSO is at first too bemused to find it odd that she should know
the name

CORSO Fargas I already saw Fargas
THE GIRL I think you should see him again

CORSO What is this a practical joke Who the hell are you What
do you know about Fargas

THE GIRL Better get dressed Ill wait for you downstairs
48 QUINTA FARGAS DRIVEWAY HOUSE EXTDAY

CORSO and THE GIRL are walking in silence up the driveway with
its carpet of dead leaves and avenue of crumbling statues He
eyes her mystified as she strides briskly along with a blue
duffel coat over her usual attire The early morning mist is
dispersing

With another look at THE GIRL who remains standing at the foot
of the steps CORSO goes up to the front door and yanks at the
bellpull producing the same muffled jangling sound as before
THE GIRL Dont bother He isnt there

CORSO (sarcastically) Really So where is he

THE GIRL Over there

She points in the direction of the ornamental pond CORSO stares
at her then walks over to it and freezes VICTOR FARGASs corpse

is floating face up among the dead leaves and lily pads An empty
brandy bottle is floating alongside

CORSO (mutters) God Almighty

He emerges from his stupor and walks back to THE GIRL whos
still standing outside the front door Ignoring her he tries the
handle but its bolted

THE GIRL You want to get inside

CORSO nods wordlessly too shocked to bandy words with her

THE GIRL looks up at the facade Then with unsuspected agility
she shins up a drainpipe beside the door and climbs onto the
balcony above it One of the French windows is broken She

reaches inside releases the catch and disappears from view

CORSO waits casting occasional glances at the ornamental pond
and its occupant

Theres the rattle of a bolt being withdrawn and THE GIRL opens
the front door from the inside

CORSO Wait here

He enters the house

49 QUINTA FARGAS RECEPTION ROOMS DRAWING ROOM INTDAY

CORSO traverses the empty reception rooms and reaches the drawing
room His foot crunches on something as he crosses it on his way
to the rug on which the occult books were stacked its the
remains of one of Fargass treasured brandy glasses He pauses

for long enough to identify it then walks on

The books are lying scattered across the rug no sign of The
Nine Gates

CORSO Shit Shit shit
He looks around helplessly Then he sees it the last of the
is still smoldering on the hearth and lying open among the
ashes charred around the edges is Fargass Nine Gates

He picks upthe mutilated volume looks at it for a moment
ruefully shaking his head and stows it in his canvas bag

50 QUINTA FARGAS EXTDAY
CORSO emerges from the house

THE GIRL Well did you find it

CORSO looks down at THE GIRL

CORSO Somebodys playing a game with me

faintly military inclination of the head

his computer screen) We dont have any vacancies but Im sure

A bottle of Scotch and a glass repose on a small desk likewise
Balkans Nine Gates and Fargass charred copy A Lucky is
smouldering in the ashtray beside them

CORSO is turning the pages of what remains of Fargass copy He
pauses at a page of text bearing a distinctive ornamental
capital peers at the gutter and detects that the page facing it
has been torn out Thoughtfully he runs his finger along the
rough edge Then he opens Balkans copy at the same place

What is missing from the charred copy is the engraving of THE
HERMIT WITH THE KEYS DOG AND LANTERN

CORSO takes a pull at his Scotch and leans back with the Lucky
between his lips thinking hard Then he glances at his watch and
stands up

like a gilded cage

59 KESSLER BUILDING LOBBY INTDAY

The SECRETARY is a big-bosomed middle-aged woman with hornrims
and scraped-back hair She looks up at CORSO with an
inquisitorial air

CORSO Bob Corso I have an appointment with Baroness Kessler

Having consulted her appointments book and her watch the
SECRETARY rises She speaks with a French accent

SECRETARY This way

She walks ahead of CORSO down a panelled corridor and stops
outside a heavy wooden door

SECRETARY (cont) You have thirty minutes

She knocks on the door and opens it

60 KESSLER BUILDING OFFICE LIBRARY INTDAY

A spacious room filled with luxuriant potted plants Beside the
window a large desk covered with papers and books some of them
open CORSO follows the SECRETARY in BARONESS KESSLER an

elegant little white-haired old lady with a Hermes scarf draped
around her shoulders turns her electric wheelchair to face him
She speaks with a pronounced German accent

BARONESS KESSLER Mr Corso Come in Ive heard a great deal
about you

She approaches with her left hand extended We see that her right
arm has been amputated at the elbow

CORSO Nothing good I hope
They shake hands

BARONESS KESSLER (to the SECRETARY) Merci Simone (to CORSO)
You hope right

The SECRETARY exits closing the door behind her

CORSO (dryly) Im reassured Baroness In my trade to be
spoken well of can be professionally disastrous

He surveys the room Visible through some open double doors on
the right is a vast library He focuses on it BARONESS KESSLER
follows the direction of his gaze

BARONESS KESSLER Yes there it is the Kessler Collection
CORSO Very impressive too I know your catalog almost by heart
BARONESS KESSLER Strange we havent met before Your name is a
byword among dealers and collectors but I imagine you know your

own reputation better than I do

CORSO It keeps the wolf from the door (smiles to change the
subject) Were you in the middle of something

BARONESS KESSLER beckons him over to the desk CORSO looks at the
array of books and papers An elegant fountain pen lies on top of

some handwritten notes

BARONESS KESSLER My latest work The Devil History and Myth -
a kind of biography It will be published early next year

CORSO Why the Devil

BARONESS KESSLER (laughs) I saw him one day I was fifteen years
old and I saw him as plain as I see you now cutaway top hat
cane Very elegant very handsome It was love at first sight

COPSO chuckles doing his best to charm the old lady

CORSO Three hundred years ago theyd have burned you at the
stake for saying that

BARONESS KESSLER Three hundred years ago I wouldnt have said
it

They both laugh
BARONESS KESSLER (cont) Nor would I have made a million by
writing about it (abruptly businesslike) What is it you wish to
discuss Mr Corso

COPSO (adjusts his glasses) Theres a book in your collection
Id like to examine

She smiles as if that were already obvious

COPSO (cont) Its The Book of the Nine Gates of the Kingdom
of Shadows

BARONESS KESSLER (unsurprised) The Nine Gates An interesting
work Everyones been asking about it lately

CORSO (stiffens almost imperceptibly) Really
BARONESS KESSLER eyes him for a moment
BARONESS KESSLER Come with me

Swinging her wheelchair around she steers it toward the double
doors and into the library beyond them CORSO follows

CORSO (cont) You really believe in the Devil Baroness

BARONESS KESSLER Enough to devote my life and my library to him
not to mention many years of work Dont you

CORSO Everyones been asking me that lately

BARONESS KESSLER looks mildly amused She sends her wheelchair
gliding over to a bookshelf and removes the third copy of The
Nine Gates

BARONESS KESSLER This book demands a certain amount of faith
CORSO My faith is in short supply

They both go over to a small table in the centre of the room
BARONESS KESSLER opens the book and turns a few pages There are

handwritten slips of paper inserted throughout

BARONESS KESSLER I know this book extremely well I studied it
for years

CORSO Do you have any doubts about its authenticity
BARONESS KESSLER (glances at him suspiciously) None whatever
CORSO Youre sure

BARONESS KESSLER My knowledge of this book is profound 1 wrote
a biography of its author

CORSO Aristide Torchia
BARONESS KESSLER A courageous man He died for the sake of this
very book in 1623 He had spent many years in Prague a centre of
the occult While there he studied the black arts and acquired a
copy of the dread Delomelanicon This is his adaptation of that
work which was written by Lucifer himself After they burned him
at the stake a secret society was founded to perpetuate its
memory and preserve its secrets the Brotherhood

CORSO The Brotherhood

BARONESS KESSLER Yes a kind of witches coven For centuries
they have met to read from this book and worship the Prince of
Darkness Today theyve degenerated into a social club for bored
millionaires I myself belonged to the Brotherhood many years
ago but time is too precious at my age I told them to go to the
Devil She titters at her own little joke

CORSO They still meet

BARONESS CORSO Every year

CORSO And you say they read from this book

He stares from the book to BARONESS KESSLER

BARONESS KESSLER No I took mine back when Liana Telfer acquired
the one in Toledo Victor Fargas is an unbeliever - he has always
refused to participate so naturally they use the Telfer copy
Not that it has ever worked (pause) They never do to be honest
CORSO So Andrew Telfer never took part

BARONESS KESSLER Never He knew nothing of these activities
until that creature Liana de Saint-Damien married him for money
She used his dollars to buy the book and renovate her chateau An
old and aristocratic family the Saint-Damiens but penniless
They have dabbled in witchcraft for hundreds of years

CORSO Telfer hanged himself last week

A brief silence She looks stunned for a moment

BARONESS KESSLER I see And Fargas

CORSO looks at her impassively

CORSO He was alive the last time we spoke

BARONESS KESSLER When was that

CORSO Two days ago

BARONESS KESSLER digests this looks at him keenly

BARONESS KESSLER Who exactly are you working for Mr Corso
CORSO My clients name is irrelevant Baroness Im simply
trying to authenticate his copy - the one Telfer sold him before
he died

BARONESS KESSLER (catches on) How stupid of me I should have
guessed

Angry now she swings her wheelchair around to face him full on

BARONESS KESSLER (cont) Youve outstayed your welcome Mr
Corso

CORSO I was hoping to examine your copy in detail

BARONESS KESSLER Certainly not Tell your client who can only
be Boris Balkan to come and examine it himself - if he dares
Tell him not to send any more wolves in sheeps clothing And
now kindly leave

Sternly she points to the door with her stump Her wheelchair
hums as she shepherds CORSO out through the office He opens the

door to the corridor

BARONESS KESSLER (cont) You dont know what youre getting
yourself into Mr Corso Get out before its too late

CORSO Im afraid it already is Baroness
BARONESS KESSLER Some books are dangerous and this is one

CORSO (smiles wryly) So people keep telling me Thanks s for
your time

BARONESS KESSLER watches him exit Hes hardly out the door when
she picks up the phone

61 KESSLER BUILDING LOBBY INTEVENING

CORSO walks back along the corridor The SECRETARY who has been
peeling an orange unsuccessfully hides it below desk level and
gives him a curt nod as he passes

62 KESSLER BUILDING RIVERSIDE STREET EXTEVENING

CORSO emerges from the building As he does so he catches sight
of the MUSTACHE leaning against the parapet of the riverside
promenade across the way

The MUSTACHE stiffens and straightens up CORSO with one eye on
him starts walking The MUSTACHE starts walking too keeps level
with him on the other side of the street

CORSO comes to a cafe For want of a better idea he goes inside

63 CAFERIVERSIDE STREET INTEXTEVENING

CORSO sits down at a table orders a drink Looking out the café
window he sees the MUSTACHE leaning against the parapet in his
former pose watching

The MUSTACHE lights a small cigar without taking his eyes off
CORSO

64 CAFERIVERSIDE STREET INTEXTNIGHT

CORSO is still sitting at his table which now has several checks
on it The lights come on blotting out his view of the street
through the window All he can now see is a reflection of the
cfes interior including his own seated figure He drums on the
table irresolutely glances at his watch deliberates

He cant postpone the moment of decision any longer He adds up
his checks and puts some money on the table Then settling his
bag on his shoulder he makes for the door He peers across the
street sees no sign of the Mustache and exits

65 RIVERSIDE STREET SEINE QUAYSIDE EXTNIGHT

CORSO emerges from the cafe Still no sign of the Mustache He
sets of falong the sidewalk glancing across the street as he
does so Then over his shoulder he catches sight of a car with
dipped headlights - a dark-colored sedan - crawling along the
curb some twenty yards behind him

On impulse he darts across the street to the riverside promenade
and dashes down the flight of steps that leads to the quay

The cars headlights blaze up it accelerates tires squealing
and swerves across the one-way street in pursuit

66 SEINE QUAYSIDE PROMENADE EXTNIGHT

CORSO races down the steps hears the car skid to a halt and
sprints off along the quay with his overcoat flapping and the
shoulder bag bumping against his flank its misty down on the
quayside and the streetlights cast a yellowish glow that hinders
visibility rather than helps it

A couple of hundred yards along the quay he runs out of steam and
slows turns to look no sign of the Mustache no sound of
pursuing footsteps Relieved but still wary he leans against the
embankment wall to catch his breath and light a cigarette Then
with a final backward look he walks on to the next flight of
steps

Hes halfway up them when the MUSTACHE a tall menacing figure
appears at the top He turns to flee but the MUSTACHE is too
quick for him He darts down the steps and punches his retreating
figure behind the ear CORSO misses the last couple of steps and
lands face down on the quayside

The MUSTACHE is on him in a flash He bends down and yanks the
strap of the bag off his shoulder CORSO resists hugs the bag
protectively gets kicked in the stomach doubles up and hangs on
for dear life

As he lies there with the MUSTACHE kicking him repeatedly and
tugging at the strap he sees silhouetted against the yellowish
misty glow of the nearest streetlight a ghostly figure flying
down the steps Its THE GIRL with her duffel coat streaming out
behind her like Supermans cape

The MUSTACHE has finally gotten the bag away from CORSO Just as
he straightens up and turns to go THE GIRL performs a flying
leap and kicks him in the solar plexus He grunts and goes
sprawling on his back dropping the bag

THE GIRL is stooping to retrieve the bag when the MUSTACHE
scrambles to his feet and lunges at her He throws a punch at her
head Although she neutralizes most of its force by riding it he
catches her a glancing blow on the nose

THE GIRL reacts like lightning kicks him in the balls He yelps
and goes into a crouch Then with a spin kick she floors him
once more He lies there spitting blood and glaring up at her
She seems to have knocked the fight out of him at last

With one wary eye on the MUSTACHE THE GIRL picks up the shoulder
bag and turns to CORSO whos struggling to his feet

Beyond her he sees the MUSTACHE get up and make for the steps
CORSO Hey hes getting away

THE GIRL merely turns to look CORSO sets off after the MUSTACHE
who has already started up the steps and just manages to grab
one of his legs The MUSTACHE kicks self free and continues up
the steps with CORSO clumsily following a few feet behind

Waiting at the top of the steps engine idling and passenger door
open is the dark sedan a Mercedes CORSO reaches street level
in time to catch a glimpse of the glamorous blonde behind the
wheel its LIANA TELFER The MUSTACHE jumps in and slams the
door The car burns rubber as it accelerates away

THE GIRL calmly climbs the last few steps with CORSO a beg in
one hand and his glasses in the other She hands them to him

THE GIRL Theyre broken You should be more careful

CORSO leaning back against the promenade wall and breathing
heavily stares at her with his mouth open He slides down the
wall and subsides into a sitting position on the sidewalk

67 RIVERSIDE STREET EXTNIGHT

CORSO one lens of his glasses cracked is still sitting on the
sidewalk with his back against the wall THE GIRL is sitting

beside him

He produces a crumpled Lucky and lights it it takes him quite a
while his hands are shaking so badly

THE GIRLs nose is bleeding She wipes it on her sleeve CORSO
produces a handkerchief as crumpled as his cigarette and hands it
to her

CORSO When did you learn all that

THE GIRL What

CORSO aims a feeble kick in the air

CORSO That stuff

THE GIRL (casually) Oh ages ago

CORSO No shit

THE GIRL gets up and holds out her hand CORSO takes it and rises
with an effort He flicks his cigarette over the parapet

They walk off along the promenade side by side

68 PARIS HOTEL LOBBY RECEPTION DESK INTNIGHT

CORSO goes up to the reception desk where GRUBER is on duty

69 PARIS HOTEL BEDROOM INTNIGHT
CORSO is filling a plastic laundry bag with ice from a tray in
the minibar

THE GIRL is sitting on the bed with her head tilted back and a
bloodstained handkerchief to her nose The bedside light bathes
the room in a subdued glow

CORSO Here hold this against your neck and lie back
He sits down beside her and hands her the improvised ice pack

She applies it to the nape of her neck lies back and shuts her
eyes

CORSO (cont) You were great down there by the river I havent

She opens her eyes and smiles at him

CORSO (cont) Like to tell me whats going on

THE GIRL (shrugs faintly) Someones after your book

CORSO They didnt have to kill Fargas to get it They didnt
have to mutilate his copy either They tore out the engravings
and ditched the rest Theres got to be more to it than that
Her nose has stopped bleeding

THE GIRL Do you believe in the Devil Corso

CORSO Im being paid to Do you

THE GIRL (smiles) Im a bit of a devil myself

She reaches up removes his glasses and puts them on the bedside
table CORSO eyes her uncertainly Then the spell is broken her
nose starts to bleed again

She puts her fingertips to it and inspects the blood on them
Very deliberately she dabbles them in the blood some more
reaches up and gently draws four vertical lines down his face
from his forehead to his mouth where her fingertips linger
CORSOs face approaches hers They melt into a passionate kiss
Then she pushes W away rolls him over on his back unbuttons

his shirt and rests her palms on his chest Playfully she runs
her forefinger over the imprint of Lianas teeth

THE GIRL (smiles mischievously) Would you know a devil if you
saw one

73 PARIS HOTEL BATHROOM BEDROOM CORRIDOR INTDAY
CORSO with his hair damp from the shower and a towel around his
waist is halfway through shaving when theres a knock on the

bathroom door

One cheek daubed with foam he opens it to find himself
confronted by a FLOOR WAITER check pad and ballpoint in hand

FLOOR WAITER Bonjour monsieur Votre petit djeuner

CORSO Oh Sure

Taking the pad he emerges into the bedroom and scribbles his
signature then stops short theres a breakfast cart in the
middle of the room but the bed in empty and The Girls clothes

WAITER Pardon

CORSO Madame ou elle est

FLOOR WAITER Je ne sais pas msieur
He makes for the door and exits

CORSO catches hold of the door just as its closing puts his
head out into the corridor looks right and left

No one in sight but the FLOOR WAITER who casts a puzzled glance
over his shoulder as he walks off

CORSO steps back into the bedroom and shuts the door He stands
there for a moment frowning at the empty bed Then abruptly
galvanized he dashes over to the minibar and looks behind it
His fears are groundless The Nine Gates is still there

Just then the phone rings He picks up the receiver and puts it
to his ear on the clean-shaven side of his face

CORSO Yes

He sits down with the shoulder bag between his feet A WAITER
appears at his elbow

CORSO (cont) (to the WAITER) Un caf noir sil vous plait

The WAITER nods and withdraws BALKAN studies CORSOs face
through his hornrims notes the glasses with the cracked lens

BALKAN Problems

BALKAN Who are you talking about

CORSO My pal Bernie Feldman for one
BALKAN The book dealer Hes dead

CORSO Murdered He was holding your book for me Someone was
after it He wouldnt give it to them

A moment is silence Then BALKAN emits a wholly incongruous
chuckle The chuckle becomes a guffaw the guffaw gives way to
peal after peal of uproarious laughter He slaps his thighs and
rocks back and forth his face turns puce his eyes fill with
tears

His hilarity is so deafening that the cafes other CUSTOMERS turn
to stare CORSO too stares at BALKAN as if hes gone crazy

BALKANs mirth gradually subsides He removes his hornrims and
mops his eyes Eventually still chuckling

BALKAN Poor fellow Very creditable of him
COPSO refrains from commenting on this outburst
CORSO Then theres Fargas

The WAITER brings CORSOS coffee BALKAN waits for him to put it
on the table and retire

BALKAN What about Fargas
CORSO Dead too
BALKAN How do you know

CORSO I saw him - and his copy or what was left of it Someone
had snitched the engravings and tried to burn the rest

BALKAN stares at him for a moment Then

BALKAN How tragic What about the Kessler copy

CORSO The old woman says its authentic but I didnt get a
chance to look at it closely As soon as she guessed you were
behind my visit she threw me out You arent her flavor of the

month

BALKAN You must see her again You must get me that copy - or
examine it at least

CORSO (derisively) Are you kidding Id have to be the Invisible

manilla envelope

beautiful BARONESS KESSLER flanked by two men in SS uniform One
of them is Heinrich Himmler

BARONESS KESSLER is scowling down at a wartime number of
Signal the Nazi propaganda magazine Its lying open on her
desk with Balkans envelope beside it

The SECRETARY shows CORSO in The BARONESS addresses her crisply
BARONESS KESSLER Merci Simone

The SECRETARY nods and exits Fixing CORSO with a cold
challenging stare BARONESS KESSLER feeds the magazine into a
shredder beside her desk She no longer looks such a dear little
old lady

77 KESSLER BUILDING LIBRARY OFFICE iNTDAY

CORSO is seated at a library table on which reposes the Kessler
copy of The Nine Gates Beside it lies his notebook and the
photocopies of Balkans engravings His shoulder bag is hanging
on the chairback his overcoat draped over it He reaches into
his pocket and produces a Lucky takes out his lighter

BARONESS KESSLER Blackmail doesnt entitle you to smoke in my
library Mr Corso

CORSO stops short and looks back through the double doors into
her office shes seated behind her desk like a graven image
watching him intently He reinserts the Lucky in its pack and
pockets his lighter Getting down to work he opens The Nine
Gates and extracts one of the Baronesss handwritten slips
reads it to himself in a low voice

CORSO I will recognize your servants my brethren by the sign
that adorns some part of their body a scar or mark of your
making

He replaces the slip BARONESS KESSLER cranes her body largely
obscures her view of the table

CORSO turns some pages and comes to the engraving of THE KNIGHT
WITH A FINGER TO HIS LIPS He compares it with the photocopy the
castle has three towers instead of four He examines the margin
of the engraving through his magnifying glass to ascertain the
presence of something he already knows will be there an LF
He turns to the chart in his notebook which has already acquired
a third row of nine boxes He writes Kessler beside it and
enters an LF in the first box

The second engraving - THE HERMIT WITH THE KEYS - appears to be
identical and the signature is AT An AT goes down in the
second box

The third engraving is different THE ANGELIC ARCHER has an arrow
in his quiver whereas the photocopy of Balkan s counterpart
does not This one too is signed LF CORSO enters an LF
in the third box

We MOVE IN until the chart FILLS THE SCREEN

SCREEN GOES BLACK

79 KESSLER BUILDING LIBRARY OFFICE

FADE IN An electrical hum punctuated by a strange rhythmical
series of clicks and thuds click-thud click-thud click-thud

CORSO sitting slumped over the table comes to He groans and
laboriously straightens up feels his head and winces The
strange sound impinges on his consciousness he looks around
vaguely for its source and discovers it

BARONESS KESSLERs wheelchair has been left in forward gear
Complete with occupant its colliding again and again with the
wall beneath a window on the other side of the room CORSO who
can just glimpse the top of the old ladys head from behind sees
it jerk forward at each impact He struggles to his feet

CORSO Baroness

No answer Unsteadily he makes his way over to the wheelchair
and swivels it around starts back with a muffled exclamation

BARONESS KESSLER has been strangled with her Hermes scarf her
cheeks are blue her eyes and tongue are protruding

Unobstructed the laden wheelchair takes off across the library
and heads for the double doors which are now closed it runs
into them full tilt bursts them open and continues on its way

Instantly smoke comes billowing into the library accompanied by
a crackle of flames The wheelchair disappears into the murk
CORSO wildly scans the table for Baroness Kesslers Nine Gates
but its gone Snatching up his notebook and abandoning his
shoulder bag and overcoat he makes for the office at a run

The office is thick with smoke and illumined by a fiery glow
CORSO pauses in the doorway shielding his face from the heat
with one hand and surveys the scene

BARONESS KESSLER and her wheelchair have come to rest in the
midst of a bonfire of books and papers CORSO can just make out
her copy of The Nine Gates on top The flames are already
engulfing it

CORSO takes a last look then dashes through the smoke to the
door and exits

On the landing CORSO bumps into the SECRETARY who has just
emerged from the elevator She gives a little shriek and drops a
paper bag Half a dozen oranges go bouncing ahead of CORSO as he
races down the stairs

In the hallway he almost upends the CONCIERGE whos wielding a
broom in her curlers Leaping aside with a startled yell she
speeds him on his way with some choice imprecations then peers
up the stairwell the upper stories are already wreathed in
smoke and sundry TENANTS have debauched onto the landings The
SECRETARY comes pelting down the stairs screaming at the top of
her lungs

82 SMALL PARIS SQUARE EXTDAY

CORSO douses his head in the basin of a fountain shakes off the
drips and massages his face Then he leans against the basin and
looks around Hes all alone in the little square

He takes out a crumpled cigarette and inserts it between his lips
with dripping fingers gropes for his lighter and vainly tries
to light it Wearily he removes the cigarette from his lips and
tosses it away All at once he spots a huge Great Dane watching
him from the mouth of an alleyway CORSO and the Great Dane stare
at each other

Then the silence is broken by a fire engines siren faint at
first but growing louder

83 RIVERSIDE STREET CORNER EXTDAY

CORSO reaches an intersection and looks around the corner
The Kessler building is ablaze Tongues of flame and clouds of
smoke are issuing from the windows of the upper stories Fire
engines and squad cars are drawn up outside FIREMEN are
directing their hoses onto the flames GENDARMES cordoning off
the street and keeping curious SPECTATORS at bay

steers him around and back outside again in one continuous
movement As she does so

THE GIRL (mutters) Just keep going

Still firmly gripping his arm she Propels him out onto the
sidewalk

CORSO (baffled) What are you playing at
THE GIRL See those men talking with your friend Gruber

CORSO turns to look inside the lobby TWO MEN IN TRENCHCOATS are
standing at the reception desk in conversation with GRUBER

THE GIRL (cont) Police

At that moment GRUBER looks past them at CORSO He briefly locks
eyes with him but shows no sign of recognition

CORSO Shit

85 PHONE BOOTH EXTINTDAY

CORSO is in the act of entering a glass phone booth

at him through the glass CORSOs only response is to turn away
and cup his hand around the receiver

CORSO (into phone) Gruber its me Corso Can you talk

his heels

A deserted sitting room with an old Herald Tribune lying

yellow Lamborghini driven by a smartly dressed mustachioed ARAB
with a BLOND BIMBO beside him

The ARAB gets out leaving his keys in the ignition Nonchalantly
signaling to the DOORMAN to park his car he disappears into the

tip from the MUSTACHE who gets in behind the wheel

Hugging the trees that border it on one side CORSO and THE GIRL
are making their way up a long straight graveled driveway The
ighted gatehouse is to their rear the lights of the chandteau can
be seen ahead

Hearing the sound of a car behind them they turn to see its
headlights swing in through the gates They quickly take cover in
the trees and watch the car - a big limo - glide past then
emerge and walk on

114 CHATEAU ST-DAMIEN EXTNIGHT

CORSO and THE GIRL observe the chateau a substantial 17th
century mansion from the edge of the trees

The forecourt in which come 20 expensive-looking cars are
parked one of them the Mercedes is illuminated by the flambeaux
on either side of the portico and the lights inside the building
The limo has pulled up at the foot of the steps and the
occupants a smartly dressed ELDERLY COUPLE are being greeted by
a tuxedoed BUTLER while their suitcases are removed from the
trunk and carried in after them by a MANSERVANT

115 CHATEAUGREAT HALL EXTINTNIGHr

CORSO and THE GIRL have worked their way around to the side of
the chateau One of the lighted windows gives them a view of the
upper reaches of the chateaus great hall with its balustraded
minstrel gallery and lofty vaulted ceiling They climb ona
stone bench for a better look

Inside overlooked by an array of ancestral portraits some 50
GUESTS are inaudibly conversing in groups Men and women alike
are attired in long black robes resembling monks habits and all
have silver pentacles suspended from their necks on silver
chains Their cowls are thrown back to reveal the heads and faces
beneath A motley assortment of people most of them middle- or
late middle-aged one or two of oriental origin No sign of Liana
or the Mustache

THE GIRL See them anywhere
CORSO No

THE GIRL They arent there

116 CHATEAUKITCHEN EXTINTINIGHT

CORSO and THE GIRL continue to make their cautious way around the
house Peering through a semi-basement window they see TWO CHEFS
chopping vegetables at a big kitchen table

They pause at a loss and look up at the house Several of the
second-floor windows are illuminated and one of them has some
creeper-covered trelliswork running up to its balcony

117 CHATEAU BALCONYLIANAS BOUDOIR EXTINTNIGHT

THE GIRL with CORSO close behind her has just reached the top
of the trelliswork She clambers over onto the balcony CORSO
scales the last few fact reaches for the balustrade straddles
it and joins her Together they peer through the French windows

With them we see a bedroom decorated in a very feminine style
all frills flounces and elegant Louis Quinze furniture Two of
Lianas Vuitton suitcases are on the floor near the dainty
fourposter A third with her discarded clothes beside it is
lying open on the bed itself

LIANA has stripped to her panties CORSO and THE GIRL watch as
she slips them off goes to a wardrobe and takes out a black
robe and silver pentacle like the ones we saw downstairs
Pulling the robe over her head she smooths it down dons the
pentacle and inspects herself in a cheval mirror in the corner
of the room

COPSO takes advantage of her preoccupation to try the French
windows They wont budge He turns to THE GIRL and shrugs then
raises his foot and kicks the glass in

LIANA spins around with a terrified cry and stands there
transfixed CORSO reaches inside turns the knob opens the
French windows and steps into the room THE GIRL follows

LIANA You

CORSO Where is it

LIANA How dare you

CORSO That book isnt yours Madame 1 need it
LIANA Get out of here both of you

CORSO goes over to the bed and empties the suitcase onto the
floor Among its contents is The Nine Gates LIANA
instinctively lunges for it but THE GIRL blocks her

CORSO (to THE GIRL) Careful she bites

Hes stooping to retrieve the book when the door opens and the
MUSTACHE robed and barefooted stands framed in the doorway
CORSO turns quickly with the book in his hand THE GIRL stiffens

LIANA makes a dive for the bedside table and produces a chrome-
plated automatic from the drawer flips the safety catch

LIANA (to CORSO and THE GIRL) Dont move either of you (to the
MUSTACHE) Get the book Bruno

CORSO takes a tentative step backward as the MUSTACHE approaches
him with his left hand extended He reluctantly surrenders the
book

The MUSTACHE rewards him for his co-operation with a vicious
right hook to the jaw CORSO goes down losing his glasses yet
again Groggily he crawls around in search of them

The MUSTACHE joins LIANA steering well clear of THE GIRL He
hands her The Nine Gates and carefully transfers the automatic
from her hand to his

LIANA (cont) Take them downstairs and lock them up Well deal
with them later theres no time now

MUSTACHE (to CORSO Italian accent) Turn around

CORSO who has scrambled to his feet complies The MUSTACHE
applies the muzzle of the automatic to the nape of his neck

MUSTACHE (cont) (to THE GIRL) You Go first Any trouble I
blow his brains

THE GIRL makes for the door The MUSTACHE prods CORSO into
motion They exit

LIANA stares after them for a moment clasping The Nine Gates
to her bosom

118 CHATEAU PASSAGE INTNIGHT

A long passage lined with more ancestral portraits The ancient
floorboards creek as THE GIRL obediently walks ahead of CORSO and
the MUSTACHE whose automatic is levelled at CORSOs back They
reach the end of the passage

MUSTACHE Go left Down the stairs

119 CHATEAU STAIRCASE PASSAGE INTNIGHT
They descend a staircase to ground level Another long passage
confronts them much like the first but floored with marble

MUSTACHE Avanti avanti

A door at the end leads into a stone-flagged passage with
whitewashed walls They make their way along it until they reach
a heavy oak door

MUSTACHE (cont) (to THE GIRL) Open it

THE GIRL does so to reveal a small landing and a flight of stone
steps leading downward She stops short the steps have no guard
rail and the cellar beneath is shrouded in darkness

120 CHATEAU WINE CELLAR INTNIGHT

The MUSTACHE prods CORSO through the doorway until ALL THREE are
on the landing then throws a light switch

Bare bulbs shed little light on the steps but illuminate a large
vaulted chamber below its the chateaus wine cellar oak
barrels and racks of bottles thick with dust and cobwebs are
housed behind an iron grille with a door in it The door is ajar
the key in the lock

MUSTACHE (to THE GIRL) Move

THE GIRL sets off down the steps CORSO follows with the MUSTACHE
at his heels

Halfway down CORSO pretends to stumble he crouches and turns in
a single movement The MUSTACHE following close behind trips
over him CORSO seizes his robe and yanks at it helping him on
his way Simultaneously

CORSO (to THE GIRL) Watch out

THE GIRL plasters herself against the wall to avoid the
MUSTACHEs somersaulting body The automatic escapes from his
hand and slithers across the flagstones as he comes to rest with
a sickening thud at the foot of the steps THE GIRL follows him

down and picks it up

CORSO reaches the foot of the steps and rolls the MUSTACHE over
on his back Hes out cold with blood oozing from a broken nose

THE GIRL (faintly admiring) I didnt know you had it in you
CORSO Another thing you didnt know

He takes hold of the MUSTACHEs ankles and with THE GIRLs
assistance hauls him through the grille into the inner cellar

He stares down at the man for a moment

CORSO (cont) Hey give me a hand I want his gear
He starts to peel of fthe MUSTACHEs robe from the feet up
revealing a pair of exceptionally hairy legs

121 CHATEAU WINE CELLAR INTNIGHT

CORSO shuts the grille door locks it and tosses the key into a
corner The MUSTACHEs naked motionless body can be vaguely
discerned through the bars

122 CHATEAU PASSAGE INTNIGHT

CORSO and THE GIRL cautiously retrace their steps along the
marble-floored passage CORSO is wearing the Mustaches robe and
pentacle over his clothes with his shoes and trouser bottoms
incongruously visible below the ham They pass the stairs they
descended and continue on their way

They turn a corner As they do so they hear a faint
intermittent hum They pause to listen then walk on The sound
grows louder and more distinct somewhere in the chateau voices
are chanting in unison

Turning another corner they find themselves in an anteroom that
terminates in two massive double doors The chanting is coming
from beyond them

CORSO walks over to the doors with THE GIRL at his heels He
grasps the handle

THE GIRL (hisses) No Up to the gallery
123 CHATEAU BACK STAIRS GALLERY INTNIGHT

The chanting is even louder now CORSO and THE GIRL reach the top
of some uncarpeted stairs and cautiously open a small door A
wave of sound hits them

124 CHATEAU GALLERY GREAT HALL INTNIGHT

They steal through the doorway into the shadowy gallery which
runs around three sides of the Great Hall and peer over the
balustrade Theyve emerged near the top of a spiral staircase
leading down from the gallery to a point near the double doors at
the rear of the hall

At the far end of the huge room in a dais draped in black with
some shallow steps leading up to it On the wall above the dais
hangs an inverted silver crucifix on the dais itself which is
flanked by a pair of outsize black candles in three-foot silver
candlesticks LIANA stands facing the hall from behind a silver
lectern on which reposes The Nine Gates Arrayed in the body of
the hall are the 50 GUESTS now cowled each holding a lighted
black candle The flickering candle flames bathe the whole scene
in tremulous chiaroscuro

LIANA and the GUESTS are taking it in turns like priest and
congregation to intone passages from the Latin text of The Nine
Gates

CORSO (quietly to THE GIRL) You stay here and cover me Im
going down

Pulling the cowl over his head he sneaks down the spiral
staircase secretes himself in the rear rank of GUESTS and
concentrates on LIANA and the book as the litany continues

All at once unseen by us the doors swing open with a crash and
BALKANs deep bass voice punctures the air on a derisive note

BALKAN (0S) Mumbo-jumbo-mumbo-jumbo-mumbo-jumbo

The GUESTS stop chanting and fifty cowled heads turn to look for
the source of this unseemly interruption Up on the dais LIANA
freezes

BALKAN Mumbo-jumbo-mumbo-jumbo-mumbo-jumbo

Looking over-life-size in his dark and elegant double-breasted
suit he strides toward the dais Any GUESTS who fail to get out
of his way in time are brusquely elbowed aside LIANA watches
him transfixed as he climbs the steps and turns to face the
bemused GUESTS

BALKAN (cont) Look around you - yes all of you What do you
see

The GUESTS involuntarily turn to look at each other

BALKAN (cont) Ill tell you a bunch of buffoons in fancy
dress What are you expecting an apparition Im the only
apparition youll see tonight You really think the Prince of
Darkness would deign to manifest himself to the likes of you He
never has and he never will - never

He closes The Nine Gates with a snap and holds it up

BALKAN (cont) You read from his book yes but you have no
conception of its true power I alone have grasped its secret I
alone have fathomed the Masters grand design I alone am worthy
to enjoy the fruits of that discovery absolute power to
determine my own destiny

LIANA finds her voice at last

LIANA Youre insane Boris (puts out her hand) Give it back at
once

BALKAN rounds on her

BALKAN As for you Liana de Saint-Damien youre even guiltier
than the rest of this pathetic rabble You have at least some

idea of what this book can do in the right hands yet you lend
yourself to these farcical proceedings these orgies of ageing
flesh conducted in the Masters name Youre a charlatan
LIANA tries to grab the book but BALKAN holds it above his head

LIANA claws his cheeks in desperation BALKAN clasps his face
dropping the book

LIANA makes a dive for it but BALKAN pounces on her They roll
over in a clinch struggling fiercely

BALKAN grabs LIANA by the throat She tries to break his grip
but he redoubles it Halfway down the dais steps with BALKAN on
top of her she fights for breath Her suffocated agonized face
is turned toward the hall

The GUESTS shrink back in horror some of them dropping their
candles Hysterical screams rend the air

CORSO comes to life Hampered by his robe he makes for dais as
fast as he can scattering frightened GUESTS in the process He
takes hold of BALKANs shoulders and tries to haul him off LIANA

BALKAN still throttling her turns to look He glares at CORSO
through his heavy hornrims his features contorted with rage and
stupefaction Then removing one hand from LIANAs throat he
deals CORSO a backhanded blow that sends him reeling

LIANA seizes the chance to break free She crawls away and almost
regains her fact but BALKAN is too quick for her grabbing her
pentacle chain from behind he proceeds to garrotte her with it

LIANA now on her knees scrabbles unavailingly at the chain that
is biting into her neck Her face turns purple her tongue begins
to protrude

CORSO looks around wildly for a weapon He seizes one of the
three-foot candlesticks and raises it over his head Suddenly

THE GIRL (0S) Dont Corso

Startled he lowers the candlestick and looks up THE GIRL is
perched on the gallery balustrade just above him

Too preoccupied with Balkan and Liana to wonder what her game is
CORSO raises the candlestick once more

THE GIRL lands on top of CORSO bearing him to the ground and
immobilizes him with a hammerlock

CORSO Get off me Hell kill her

THE GIRL Leave them

BALKAN completes his grisly work LIANAs purple face is all too
reminiscent of Baroness Kesslers With a final tug at the chain

he plants one foot in the small of LIANAs back and sends her
limp body sprawling across the floor of the hall
Screams and cries of horror go up from the GUESTS who have
recoiled still further

BALKAN straightens up a somewhat dishevelled but still imposing
figure despite the scratches on his cheeks Even his hornrims are
still in place He leans fonward eyes narrowed in a mock
menacing way and stamps his foot

BALKAN (in a voice like thunder) Boooh

With more hysterical screams and cries of dismay the GUESTS turn
tall and flee the hall like a herd of panic-stricken cattle
jostling each other in their eagerness to get out the door
Calmly without so much as a glance at THE GIRL CORSO or
LIANAs corpse BALKAN smooths his hair down picks up The Nine
Gates and strides majestically after them

Silence falls THE GIRL releases her grip on CORSOs arm gets
off him and rises to her knees He sits up nursing his elbow and
staring at her with blank incomprehension

CORSO Why did you do it

THE GIRL Some things are meant to happen That was one of them

CORSO Dont give me that crap again You were working for him
all along

THE GIRL Funny I thought you were

CORSO You played me for a sucker the two of you I dont intend
to take the rap for that maniac

THE GIRL He just murdered someone with a roomful of witnesses
That lets you off the hook for the other killings You should be
grateful

CORSO Im ecstatic

He gets to his feet We hear the sound of cars starting up and
driving off in a hurry

THE GIRL rises too starts to pat the dust of fhis robe CORSO
impatiently evades her hand

CORSO (cont) Wheres he off to

THE GIRL What do you care Your job is done This is as far as
you need to go

CORSO The hell it is The sonofabitch owes me the other half of
my fee

THE GIRL (ironically) Of course its just business I thought
your curiosity had gotten the better of you
CORSO Okay so whats meant to happen next

THE GIRL You really want to know

125 MERCEDESMINOR ROAD EXTDAWN

THE GIRL with CORSO red-eyed and unshaven beside her is driving
along a country road bordered by rolling fields wreathed in gray
mist Theyve appropriated Lianas Mercedes sedan

126 MERCEDESFREEWAY EXTDAY

CORSO has taken over the wheel THE GIRL is fast asleep with her
heed on his shoulder The deserted freeway runs across a viaduct
that spans a valley hundreds of feet below The hazy blue shapes
of mountains can be glimpsed in the distance

127 MERCEDESMOUNTAIN ROAD EXTSUNSET

THE GIRL is back behind the wheel CORSO smoking Dazzled by the
setting sun THE GIRL lowers the visor The landscape has become
bleaker and more mountainous Switchbacks are visible ahead
128 MERCEDESMOUNTAIN ROAD EXTDUSK

The Mercedes rounds a bend

Visible in the distance crisply silhouetted against the
afterglow is a castle

Its the one of which we saw a backlighted photograph on Balkans
wall

129 CASTLE EXTDUSK

THE GIRL pulls up some distance from the archway that was once
the castle gate A dark green Range Rover is already parked
beside it CORSO and THE GIRL get out and briefly survey the
derelict building A glimmer of light is issuing from the arrow
slits in one of the turrets

130 CASTLE COURTYARD EXTDUSK

CORSO and THE GIRL cross the deserted courtyard which is
littered with fallen masonry

131 CASTLE STEPS BATTLEMENTS EXTDUSK

CORSO and THE GIRL climb a dilapidated flight of stone steps to
the battlements and walk along them to the tower

They pause outside the moldering old door and listen A mans
voice is faintly audible

CORSO puts his hand on the handle THE GIRL gropes in the pocket
of her duffel coat and produces the chromium-plated automatic
holds it out

CORSO hesitates briefly then stuffs it in his jacket pocket He
op the door and enters followed by THE GIRL

132 TURRET CHAMBER INTNIGHT

CORSO and THE GIRL are looking down into the interior of the
turret which forms a cylindrical chamber Theyre on a small
landing from which a steep flight of unprotected stone steps
curves down and around the inner wall to the floor of the
chamber The floor littered with debris including worm-eaten
beams that have fallen from the ceiling far above consists of
massive age-old planks

A large circle has been chalked in the middle of the floor and
within it a square divided into nine boxes numbered 1-9 Each box
contains some unrelated object a rusty knife a piece of cord a
stone a gold ring a serpentine bracelet a glass vial a small
pile of earth a quill pen an hourglass

The chamber is illuminated by half a dozen kerosene lamps located
around the circle but outside it Also near the circle is a
campers collapsible table with various objects on it a black
briefcase The Nine Gates a magnifying glass a vacuum flask
and mug On the floor beside the table are a large jerrican and
an open suitcase with more books spilling out of it

The voice we heard from outside is that of BALKAN but a BALKAN
unlike any we have seen before no jacket or necktie shirt
sleeves rolled up vest half unbuttoned strands of gray hair
falling over his scratched and sweating face cheeks flushed
eyes ablaze with excitement

Hes kneeling in front of the numbered boxes and gabbling to
himself in an expressionless monotone

BALKAN eight doors come before the Serpent that guards the
word Teth Enea Novem Oded the number nine which holds the
final secret the mystery of mysteries The Serpent is the beast
that always sleeps with one eye open and is reflected in the
Mirror of Knowledge (giggles triumphantly) Eight engravings plus
one or one plus eight which coincides with the number that St
John of Patmos attributed to the Beast 666

CORSO (to THE GIRL) He needs therapy

Feverishly BALKAN proceeds to scrawl some numerals on the floor
with a piece of chalk muttering as he does so

BALKAN Six plus six plus six equals eighteen One and eight
(even more triumphantly) One plus eight equals nine

CORSO starts to descend the steps THE GIRL stays behind sits
down on the top step props her chin on her hand and watches the
proceedings

BALKAN rises with chalk dust all over the knees of his pants He
goes to his briefcase and takes out a sheaf of torn engravings

CORSO has reached the foot of the steps BALKAN turning to
resume his place in the circle catches sight of him He freezes
in disbelief and a long moment passes before he speaks

BALKAN (cont) What are you doing here

CORSO I thought Id drop in before they put you behind bars
BALKAN Go away

CORSO We had a deal remember

BALKAN A deal What impertinence You bungled it damn you You
failed me all along the line Thanks to your lack of
initiativeIi was compelled to do my own dirty work And I did
it I got these myself See here they are (brandishes the
engravings speaks with mounting vehemence) Nine engravings or
nine doors and only an initiate can open them Each door has two
keys each engraving discloses a number a secret element and
keyword to be interpreted in the light of reason and the Cabbala
the one true philosophy

CORSO I want my money
BALKAN Dont you understand whats going on here

He returns to the circle kneels down again and deals out the
engravings like playing cards one to a box leaving three boxes
empty Meantime

BALKAN (cont) You have before you the mystery of which men have
dreamed throughout the centuries Thousands have died an
agonizing death in hopes of just a glimpse of what youre about
to see

CORSO Yeah Whats that Old Nick in person

BALKAN Dont be ridiculous He has never appeared to anyone
never Hes a spirit - the spirit of pure evil He manifests
himself through his servants of whom Im proud to be one

He rises walks quickly over to the little table and opens The
Nine Gates Turning over several pages he tears out an
engraving His voice betrays rising excitement his face assumes
a look of insane fervour

BALKAN (cont) Three copies but only nine of their twenty-seven
engravings hold the key and I have them all (tears out two more
engravings in quick succession) 1 have only to complete the
sequence Then the Serpent will enter the seal of Saturn and I -
I shall enter the Ninth Gate
CORSO Cut the crap and write me a cheque

BALKAN returns to the circle kneels down once more and neatly
positions the three engravings in the empty boxes Then he rises
goes to the table and pours himself a drink from the vacuum
flask He gargles with it swallows and shakes himself like a
wet dog Whatever the flask contained it seems to have
invigorated him

Seizing the jerrican he removes the cap and dribbles gasoline
around the circle then picks up one of the kerosene lamps and
hurls it at the floor The lamp smashes and ignites the gasoline
instantly hes ringed with fire

He draws himself up and stands erect in the canter of the circle
with flames dancing all around him

BALKAN I give you my allegiance Master I surrender myself unto
you body and soul Let me fear neither noose nor sword nor
poison Let me walk unscathed among lepers and the plague-ridden
Erase me from the Book of Life and inscribe me in the black Book
of Death Let it be no Let it be so now

His fervent voice and the wild-eyed demented look on his face
are such that not even CORSO is tempted to break the momentary
silence that ensues

BALKAN (cont) (ecstatically) Yes master yes Oh thank you
thank you I can feel the power flowing through me like an
electric current rendering me capable of any achievement mental
or physical I could float on air walk on water

He stoops and dabbles his hands in the ring of fire

BALKAN (cont) See 1 plunge my hands in fire and feel no heat

He picks up the jerrican and inverts it over his head dousing
himself in the contents then hurls it aside

CORSO Hey dont be stupid
But BALKAN is deaf to reason

BALKAN (in a mounting frenzy) Admay Eloy Agla Zatel Gebal
Elimi Ashtoreth Moloch Shamash Dagon

With a whoosh he himself catches fire Flames play over his
ecstatic figure

BALKAN (cont) Its miraculous I feel nothing nothing at all
He emits another triumphant laugh that soars up the scale until
it becomes a high-pitched scream of agony He starts to caper

around slapping at his clothes his face his hair

CORSO has regained his feet He takes the automatic from his
pocket and sends it slithering across the floor and through the
ring of flames

CORSO Here you idiot

He retreats up the steps with horror written on his face THE
GIRL has risen to her feet He takes her hand and with a last
backward glance hustles her outside

133 CASTLE COURTYARD EXTNIGHT

Balkans wild screams reverberate around the walls as CORSO and
THE GIRL hurry across the courtyard

134 CASTLE EXTNIGHT

CORSO and THE GIRL are standing beside the Mercedes Smoke and
tongues of flame are issuing from the arrow slits of Balkans
tower His screams rise in a crescendo Then a gunshot cuts them
off like a knife

CORSO He really thought it would work

THE GIRL He wasnt to know it wouldnt

CORSO stares at her momentarily puzzled then at the blazing
castle then back at her

CORSO You didnt do anything to help him Greeneyes not this
time

THE GIRL Im your guardian angel remember

She lays her palm against his cheek then crooks her hand around
the nape of his neck and draws his face toward hers kisses him
tenderly on the lips CORSO returns her kiss He folds her in his
arms and holds her close The fiery glow dances over their
entwined figures

135 CASTLE EXTNIGHT

LONG SHOT of the castle ablaze The flames have spread from
Balkans tower to the rest of the building Smoke and flames are
now belching from it The sky overhead is tinged with crimson
136 PARIS HOTEL BATHROOM BEDROOM CORRIDOR INTEARLY MORNING
CORSO his hair damp from the shower and a towel around his
waist is halfway through shaving when theres a knock on the

bathroom door

One cheek daubed with foam he opens it to find himself
confronted by the FLOOR WAITER check pad and ballpoint in hand

FLOOR WAITER Bonjour msieur Votre petit djeuner

CORSO Oh Sure
Taking the pad he emerges into the bedroom and scribbles his
signature then stops short theres a breakfast cart in the
middle of the room but the bed is empty No sign of The Girl or
her clothes

CORSO (cont) Where is she

WAITER Pardon

CORSO Madame ou elle est

FLOOR WAITER Je ne ai pas vue msieur

He makes for the door and exits

CORSO catches hold of the door just as its closing puts his
head out into the corridor looks right and left No one in sight
but the FLOOR WAITER who casts a puzzled glance over his
shoulder as he walks off

137 PARIS HOTEL LOBBY RECEPTION DESK INTDAY

CORSO now dressed but unshaven hurries over to the reception
desk where GRUBER is on duty

GRUBER greets him with an almost imperceptible inclination of the
head

GRUBER Good morning Mr Corso

CORSO Morning Gruber The young lady I came with have you seen
her

GRUBER Yea sir She went out not long ago

He reaches behind him and produces a folded message slip from one
of the pigeonholes

GRUBER (cont) She asked me to give you this

He hands the slip to CORSO who opens it With him we read

See you around maybe

And below

PS The 9th Engraving was a forgery

138 TOLEDO STREET ALLEY EXTDAY

CORSOs footsteps echo as he walks along one of Toledos narrow
medieval streets The steel-framed glasses with the cracked lens
have been replaced by a new pair with gold frames Hes wearing a
smart new overcoat and has a new leather bag slung from his

shoulder

He rounds a corner and heads down the deserted alleyway we saw in
Scene 27 No scaffolding just sandblasted walls and freshly
painted window frames and grilles

He reaches the doorway leading to the inner courtyard hears a
womans strident cries bumps into THE BOY who comes running out
as before

139 TOLEDO COURTYARD CENIZA BROS WORKSHOP EXTDAY

CORSO crosses the courtyard to the steps that led down to the
Cenizas workshop He stops short and stares

The old door - HERMANOS CENIZA - RESTAURACION DE LIBROS - has
been taken of ew its hinges and propped on its side against the
basement wall The display window is just a gaping hole the
window frame has been ripped out exposing the masonry
surrounding it The whirr of a power tool can be heard

CORSO looking puzzled descends the steps

140 TOLEDO CENIZA BROS WORKSHOP INTDAY

CORSO pauses in the doorway and surveys the interior The hand
press has disappeared and the floor is littered with debris Pale
rectangular patches on the grey walls indicate where counters and

cabinets have been ripped out

TWO SPANISH WORKMEN are busy detaching an old cabinet from the
wall with an electric screwdriver

CORSO Oiga

He has to repeat himself before they interrupt their activities
ST WORKMAN Seftor

CORSO Los Hermanos Ceniza

ST WORKMAN Los Ceniza (glances at the 2ND WORKMAN) Estéandn
muertos

CORSO Como muertos Quando

ST WORKMAN Oh hace anos anos

CORSO ANOS

The 2ND WORKMAN comes over wiping his hands on his apron
2ND WORKMAN Ingles

CORSO Americana

2ND WORKMAN (as if that explained everything) Ah They dead
many years

CORSO (more and more puzzled) But they were here not long ago -
I spoke with them

The 2ND WORKMAN looks at his colleague shrugs and chuckles as if
to convey that Corso is crazy like most foreigners

1ST WORKMAN Disculpe

He indicates that CORSO is in the way

Utterly disconcerted CORSO backs up as they manhandle the
cabinet away from the wall and tilt it forward prior to laying it

face down on the floor

As they do so a dusty piece of paper slides off the top of the
cabinet and seesaws to the floor like a falling leaf

Instinctively CORSO stoops and picks it up He looks at it idly
then more closely His eyes widen

Its the Ninth Engraving THE WOMAN RIDING A SEVEN-HEADED DRAGON
WITH A CASTLE ABLAZE IN THE BACKGROUND

The womans face bears a strong resemblance to that of The Girl
141 TOLEDO ALLEY EXTDAY

CORSO walks back along the alleyway with the engraving in his
hand His receding figure dwindles to a speck

THEENOD
