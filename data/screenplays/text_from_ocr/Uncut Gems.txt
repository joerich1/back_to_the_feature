EXT OPAL MINE - ETHIOPIA - DAY

Unrest White foremen violently argue via translators with a
group of local black miners A fist fight breaks out and quickly
grows into a riot Two MEN both black take advantage of the
chaos to sneak inside the mine

INT OPAL MINE - ETHIOPIA -— CONTINUOUS

The MEN don head lamps and plunge into the darkness of the mine
The sound of the riot quickly recedes behind them overtaken by
their own heavy echoed breaths They stop at a ragged t-shirt
stuck in a crevice in a wall

MAN 1 keeps look-out as MAN 2 pulls the t-shirt out and uses a
screw driver to dislodge a large clump of dirt from the crevice

MAN 2 crumbles the dirt away exposing a rock the size of a
grapefruit Using an electric grinding sander he exposes small
‘windows’ on either side of the rock and holds it up to a light
for inspection

Twinkling electronic music fades in as the camera moves into the
gem Light and color engulf the frame in a shifting melange of
abstract shapes and patterns

UNCUT GEMS

CREDITS accompany our psychedelic journey through the insidd of
the gem A metallic shimmer appears in the distance as we near
it we see that it’s a boxing gym bell

extends it to HOWARD

HOWARD (CONTD)
You know I forgot what it even

HOWARD
Sure let’s go to my office

INT KMA GEMS AND JEWELRY OFFICE- BACKROOM - CONTINUOUS
HOWARD walks to his desk AMARE ducks down to clear the doorway

AMARE
Howard this stone means a lot to
me Importance is a feeling that
comes from within Most people
think the opposite

HOWARD
Morons

AMARE
This stone does something for me
With it I feel a connection to the
ground and hence the sky and of
course to the cosmos It’s very
important to me

HOWARD
I can tell you feel that way

AMARE
I want to buy it

HOWARD
Okay How much is it worth to you

AMARE
I have 175000 cash with me

HOWARD
(laughing)
Amare buddy I’m sorry this stone
is worth a helluva lot more than
that
AMARE
And Court-side seats for the rest
of the season That’s easily a 50
thousand dollar value You could
sell each and every ticket

HOWARD
Normally I wouldn’t give a shit
Id give it to you for free But
it’s all a bit messy right now I’m
stuck in a hole and to be honest
my life is being threatened on a
nightly basis I only tell you this
to emphasize why I’m obligated to
sell this gem for the most money I
can get

AMARE
(interrupting)
This is a lot of money for me

HOWARD
You make millions of dollars

AMARE
It’s not what you think I get paid
in stipends People hold onto a lot
my cash A lot of it is tied up in
investments This is a number I can
do Plus I’1l post a picture of
you once a week on my Instagram

HOWARD
You’re not understanding me

AMARE grows angry but then controls himself

AMARE
I feel like I’m being very fair
It’s an honest price for a gem of
this kind

HOWARD feels conflicted

HOWARD

Look it’s already listed with
Christies If it means that much to
you you’re free to attend and bid
on the item like everyone else Who
knows you could get it for 175
there I doubt it but I haven’t
even had the thing appraised yet

AMARE
When is the auction

HOWARD
Monday

AMARE
Okay fair enough But you will let
me hold onto it until the auction
date I have a game tonight and two
on the road one in Cleveland and
one in Atlanta I can have it back

HOWARD
(laughing)
Amare buddy I have a million
things to do with it before the
auction including like I said
getting it appraised

AMARE stands up

AMARE
Youre saying no again

HOWARD
I’m sorry I can’t I just can’t

AMARE walks back to the showroom

INT CHRISTIES AUCTION HOUSE BACK ROOM - DAY

AREN a plump man Jewish late 40s examines the gem with a wet
grinder He dries it off re-wets it and holds it up to a light

HOWARD
Incredible huh

With a digital caliper AREN measures it’s size then weighs it

HOWARD (CONTD)
Can you believe that was noodled
AREN
Sure I can

AREN sends light through the stone and checks its refraction

AREN (CONTD) (CONTD)
Well it’s certainly not the
harlequin multi color black
precious you said it was

HOWARD
What What do you mean what’s
wrong with it It’s harlequin

AREN
Look it’s got a basic pin-fire
pattern

HOWARD
No no no-

AREN
(looks deeper)
Limited in color

HOWARD
That’s a crock of shit I had the
thing under dull lighting and saw
full spectrum

AREN
It won’t face up across it’s
largest dimension

HOWARD
What’s that mean I’m not an opal
guy

AREN

It means even with the best cutter
you won’t get it to fully face
upright It will undulate

HOWARD
Okay fine so we’re looking at
what a ‘G’ a carat

AREN
It’s not even as dark as true black
should be like you had told us

HOWARD
It’s black as night And the thing
is skin to skin

AREN
But it isn’t Maybe it’1l yield
30-40 Look you know noodled
opals are a gamble Why you didn’t
tell Steven this is beyond me

HOWARD
Steven was doing me a favor I saw
pictures it was windowed for us
there It’s from Welo

AREN
I don’t know about that Welo opals
aren’t this big-and I’m seeing that
there very well could be a flaw or
two looks like a grain of sand

about a mil deep there are a lot
of notches

HOWARD
The thing’s gorgeous I could get
650 for it in an hour

AREN
I’m sorry Howard I can’t appraise
it at that We’ve already estimated
this at 750 to a mil

HOWARD
Okay let’s keep it at that
AREN
You kidding me I’d lose my GIA
certification

(looking at gem)
We can say the 175 to 250 range
Start bidding at 100

HOWARD paces about

HOWARD
175 Fuck this I’m gonna bring
it to Carol’s she’s certified and
knows a lot more bout opals than
you do she’s already seen it

HOWARD’s phone rings He silences it without looking at it

AREN
Then she told you the same thing
C’mon Howard I have no reason to
lie to you You gotta hope for a
collector a jeweler won’t even
take this on most likely

HOWARD
But it’s beautiful

HOWARD’s phone rings and again he silences it

HOWARD (CONTD)
If people see it up close they’1l
bid through the roof Can’t we show
a video of what it looks like
inside

AREN
Won’t matter They’re gonna
withdraw it

HOWARD
Let me deal with Steven He won’t
pull it Can you guys do the video

pocket On the caller ID it says “DINA”

An AUCTIONEER an Indian man 40’s British accent stands at a
podium spouting off information about a collection of ruby
encrusted necklaces Above him large TV’s show the necklaces in
detail Prices are tracked and translated into other currencies
on a second monitor Each side of the room is lined with manned
telephones The general public and registered bidders sit with
paddles and books in rows of chairs

Sitting in the front is GOOEY flipping through the auction
catalogue

Several rows back sit one of AMARE’S BODY GUARDS and a well-
dressed white woman in her mid-30’s Amare’s PERSONAL ASSISTANT

Seated in the back are JIM and ROBERT

HOWARD stands by the side of the room also flipping through the
auction catalogue

The ruby necklaces go to bidder in the back The system moves on
to the next item Images of the Opal appear on the big screen
Curtains open and a MODEL in a formal dress appears holding the
gem on a pillowed cushion

AUCTIONEER

Before we move onto item number 38
we have a formal statement from
Christies to announce an apology

(reads from paper)
Those of you in attendance for our
next item for auction Item 38 a
600 carat precious black opal from
Lightning Ridge Australia please
accept our sincerest apologies We
recently learned that the opal is
in fact from the Welo mines in
Ethiopia and estimated not in the
750000 to million range but
155000 to 225000

(off script)
Under normal circumstances we would
pull such an item but we do feel
that the gem is still a unique
exquisite specimen

A close up of the HOWARD’S gem is projected above

AUCTIONEER (CONTD)

As you can see the rough opal has
been windowed on either side
Before even being cut you can see a
dazzling array of color in the
classic pin-fire pattern that with
the right cutter could yield up to
50 or 60 There seem to be a few
recorded totches on the backside
and cutting needs to be precise if
that is the intention of the buyer
Let’s open this at 40000

Amare’s PERSONAL ASSISTANT starts the bidding off raising her
paddle

AUCTIONEER (CONTD)
We have 40 grand can we see 50

option of selling it to Amare
directly He already offered me 175
in cash for the opal just the other
day

JIM
You’re telling me you had 175 grand
in front of you recently and said
no

HOWARD
Well it wasnt that simple I had
an agreement to auction with

kind of penalties they charge for a
last minute cancellation
