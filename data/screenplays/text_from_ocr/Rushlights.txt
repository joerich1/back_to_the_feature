walks down the corridor checking for the right apartment

on Suddenly a loud BANG as a door is slammed shut Billy
whirls around Again Nothing Billy finds his way to the
correct apartment He takes a breath knocks

A true dump Dim light trash everywhere cheap furniture
Dirty yellow walls show cracks dubious spills Drug
paraphernalia spread out on a coffee table

The twisted and lifeless body of a girl is spread out on a
nearby sofa

As Billy slowly enters he freezes at the sight of the dead
girl syringe still sticking in her arm His face drops as he
moves closer toward the dead girl Sarah

BILLY
(a horrified whisper)
Shit Sarah

Suddenly Billy’s jolted by the sound of a faint sob He turns
and recognizes a familiar silhouette which gives him a
moment’s relief It’s Sarah The resemblance between the dead
girl and her is striking

He points to the coffee and an English muffin in front of

SARAH

god damn quick Just yesterday I was full
of hope things were changing for the
better Finally Next thing I know I’m
out of a job hours later I find my best
friend with a needle in her arm Dead

For a moment it looks like she’s going to lose it

BILLY
Take it easy

SARAH

Billy nods trying not to pressure her

SARAH (CONTD)
Well you’ve figured out by now I’m not
this sweet innocent girl you probably
might’ve thought I was

stretches out her bare arms She turns both her arms
revealing numerous scars Needle marks Healed up

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary
SARAH (CONTD)
That’s the past I don’t do that anymore

BILLY
Okay

Quietly she continues

SARAH
A few months ago Ellen said she’d had
enough of all this drug bullshit She
wanted to go back to school So she
decides we should both check into rehab
She’s on the phone for days till she
manages to find a place that takes us
She even paid for it So we got really
stoned and we went to this clinic Except
when I woke up she was gone I stayed

BILLY
What happened to her

SARAH
They woke her in the middle of the night
Her parents had died in a car crash the
day before we checked in

BILLY
Wow That’s really fucked up(pause) What
about tonight

SARAH

We got into a fight because I asked her
not to get loaded around me I tell her
I’m trying to stay clean and seeing her
get high doesn’t make it any easier I
don’t think any of it registered yknow
Couple of hours later I hear her fighting
with the guy from next door her dealer
Our dealer At some point I fell asleep

Sarah winces at the memory starts to tremble

SARAH (CONTD)
And then I just woke up for no reason
yknow how that happens sometimes And I
see her on the couch sleepingonly she
isn’t making noises like she’s
breathing

She starts to sob quietly again She puts her forehead
between her hands Billy gently touches her wrist

SARAH (CONTD)

If only I’d just gone next door and told
that prick to leave us alone

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary
BILLY
Thing is if it wouldn’t have been that
dealer she’d have gotten her dope
someplace else If this didn’t happen
last night maybe it would have happened
today Some people just have a short
ticket on this planet There’s no rhyme
or reason for it It just is

Sarah stares at Billy She pulls out a cigarette nervously
plays with it Then
SARAH
What am I doing laying all this shit on
you We don’t even know each other

BILLY
We sort of do now don’t you think

Sarah sighs glances far away

SARAH
I should go to the police

BILLY
Why Won’t make any difference now It’s
nobody’s fault

SARAH
What am I going to do I don’t even know
where I’m going to stay

DREAM SEQUENCE
EXT DAY DESERTED LAKE - MONTAGE OVER MUSIC -

A hot summer day Overcast skies We see Billy and Sarah
swinging high above the smooth waters of an abandoned mining
lake via a make shift swing Dressed in cut-off jeans both
are laughing teasing each other while swaying back and
forth below the vast branches of large overgrown trees
reaching beyond the edge of the lake Eventually both release
their grip as their skinny bodies plunge into the blue water
We watch as the two are swimming below the surface of the
lake ascending toward the blurry sunlight Moments of joy and
young innocent love follow Billy and Sarah are necking each
other while embracing and kissing holding on to one another
subsiding and rising between the water surface Lounging
inside a car’s inner tube Sarah puffs a cigarette blowing
smoke into Billy’s face She laughs innocently Both giggle
away and engage in a mock fight as Billy splashes water onto
Sarah rocking the rubber tube Ultimately the black
makeshift lounge-chair tips over as the two disappear into
the depths of the lake

EXT POLICE STATION TREMO DAY

Billy and Sarah come storming out of the building Cameron is
one step behind the couple

CAMERON
Im really sorry about what happened in
there My brother’s a good man He is
just a bit too eager at times

Billy thinks for a moment then

BILLY
Should I’ve told him about the guy that
broke into the house a few nights ago
Maybe Niles was mixed up in something
you knowsomethingfucked up

CAMERON
Were you able to get a look at this guy
this “intruder” Could you ID him

BILLY
Short with long dark hair kinda
stocky

CAMERON

Did he take anything

BILLY
I’m not sure He tried

He exchanges a glance with Sarah
SARAH

We didn’t bother you about it but with
the Sheriff pulling all this nonsense

Billy presses “Eject” Seconds later a tape pops out Cameron
looks on however Billys back is blocking the view Billy
tape in his hand gets up and turns to Cameron

CAMERON (CONT’D)
Wow

Billy nods and hands Cameron the tape

CAMERON (CONTD)
I’ll get rid of this dirt Niles had a
respectable reputation and I don’t see
how its being tainted now will serve our
cause particularly

BILLY
Would Nile being gay weaken the claims
of an illegitimate son

CAMERON
Not significantly I’m afraid The
phenomenon of men with homosexual tastes
fathering children isn’t that rare

Cameron puts the cassette into his briefcase The lowering
sun beams inside the living room hitting Billy in the eyes
He moves to the window to lower the blinds

BILLY
I gotta question

CAMERON
Go right ahead

BILLY
In your professional opinion how much
longer is this whole ordeal gonna last

CAMERON
Well once foul play is suspected
Alabama probate court will put an
immediate hold on the case I’d say at
least a month closer to two

The blinds won’t lower Billy pulls on it but it’s stuck

BILLY
A month or two I don’t think we can stay
that long

Billy twists the cord way over to the right then rips it
back to the left Finally the blinds lower

CAMERON
Are you folks strapped for cash Since I
do have power of attorney it wouldnt be
improper for me to advance you some
money

BILLY
What did you have in mind

CAMERON
How about five thousand dollars

Billy responds without hesitation

BILLY
Well wait for the settlement

CAMERON
I understand Do you know anything about
art Billy

Cameron moves towards the mantel and points to the painting
Billy retrieved from the cellar Billy shrugs no

CAMERON (CONTD)
Well Niles taste in art waspretty
eclectic I think he paid a hundred and
thirty five thousand for that one
(MORE )

I imagine you could get at least twice
that much at any art auction

Billy moves closer to the painting Two men aim muskets at a
large white elephant that is fleeing across a river in the
African bush country while African natives look on
BILLY
A hundred thirty five thousand bucks For
this
Cameron nods They both look at the painting

BILLY (CONTD)
Must be nice to have that kind of cash

CAMERON
I wouldn’t knowI should get going

He heads for the front door resumes the avuncular mode

Sly laughs out loud then shifts gears to serious

SLY (CONTD)
You need a document stating that Niles
wanted his money going to his niece and
his niece only

BILLY
Well I dont have that document

Sly smiles and nods takes a sip from his glass

SLY
Youve got a problem then dont you I
bet Niles knew all about this ‘cause he
came to me two days before he passed
away He was going to have me change his
will to explicitly exclude anyone but
Ellen

Sly lets this sink in Billys mind races

SLY (CONTD)
You want that drink now

Sly pours Billy a drink and slides the glass toward Billy He
then pours one for himself and quickly drains it

SLY (CONTD)
Kind of a coincidence dont you think
He ends up dead right before he intends
to change his will

BILLY
You could testify

of photographs One is with Belle her two sons and her
husband the Sheriff Robert Sr The other is a picture of her
with Zachary Niles

BILLY
You know I was looking for you tonight

BELLE
For me If it was about the house-keeping
it could’ve waited till tomorrow

Billy rises a little fragile and goes back to the pictures

BILLY
No it wasn’t about the housekeeping
you and your late husband raised two
sons Sheriff Bob and Cameron

BELLE
Yes that’s right Two big beautiful
boys

BILLY

Your family didn’t mind all those long
hours with you keeping house for Zachary
Niles

BELLE
It was a privilege working for an
accomplished and prosperous man like Mr
Niles And we needed the extra money

Billy peers at the photos again

BILLY
You the late Sheriff and Bob you look
like three peas in a pod

BELLE
Yes

BILLY
Not Cameron though

Belle shrugs a little uneasily

I don’t know what you mean

She adds a nervous smile that doesn’t convince

asking that he acknowledge your son
How could you stand for it what he did
to you I mean after the way you took
care of him and the way you felt about
him

BELLE
(beat )
It wasn’t that simple What would people
think if they knew what we were up to
How would they treat my family my
husband my little boys

BILLY
If you didn’t want to make him pay there
was somebody else who did

BELLE
What do you mean

BILLY
Cameron is Niles’ son And when Niles
handed the inheritance to Ellen he
realized that he was going to be cut out
of everything that was rightly his Cut
out same as his mother had been

BELLE
You have no right

BILLY
Deep down you gotta know that it was
Cameron that killed Niles

BELLE
That’s not possible Zachary Mr
Niles’ death was an accident

BILLY
You’re not up on current affairs ma’am

So you’re telling me that “Edward
Romero” didn’t have the same idea a

bullets and slides them underneath the bathroom door into
the hallway Billy eyes widen He picks up one of the
bullets then checks the chamber of the pistol It’s empty

BILLY (CONTD)
Shit Sarah Ijust uhm about the
gun There’s no bullets in the chamber

SARAH
Stay away Nothing worse than the stench
of booze

There is a long pause Nobody knows what to say Then

SARAH (CONTD)
You know my dad owned this car
dealership When sales were up and he was
drunk enough he’d run around the house
calling himself the ‘King of Chrysler’
It was so damn stupid On weekends he had
these business friends over to our house
His “Inner Circle” he said Sometimes
around three four in the morning he
would come bashing into our rooms and
drag us down into the den First they
made us drink and sometimes we had to
dance and strip

Billy glances at the bullets as he listens closely

SARAH (CONTD)
Dad came up with this idea for a contest
Whoever was the most sexy was allowed to
go back to bed I was eight I think My
two sisters were older and they’d do all
kinds of things I tell you the stink of
liquor and old men I’1l never forget it

BILLY
I was wrong I’m I’m sorry I mean it

stolen His injured eye is hidden behind an eye patch Hurled
up in the corner of the room Billy is leaning on Sarah’s
shoulder Edward pulls out a small plastic container tears
off the lid with his teeth and starts chewing away on several
pain killers

some clothes and what not but all
things considered not a bad comeback
what do say Sarah I even found myself a
nice 38 along the wayoh one piece
of advice Billy next time you’re on the

picks up the whiskey bottle and throws it against the wall
The bottle smashes into pieces the liquor drenches the
carpet He strikes Billy with his gun across the face Billy
cries out in pain

SARAH
Stop it

Sarah throws her arms up attempting to hit Edward The lit
cigarette goes up in the air then hits the alcohol-drenched
carpet The carpet ignites Edward punches her into the
stomach Sarah falls to the ground groaning coughing

EDWARD
You wanna to kill me baby Well you
don’t know what you’re doing Forgot to
make sure to kill me dead Let me show

broken off leg exposing a metal rood She grabs the
sculpture and plants the stake-like pole deep into Edwards
chest leaving the flamingo standing tall Sarah shouts

SARAH

Somehow in my fucked-up head I kept
thinking that once I found a way around

how it started wouldn’t matter It’s a
bad gambler’s habit You need a lucky
streak so bad you get convinced it’s
gotta come

SARAH
You really want me to believe that

Billy pulls over onto the shoulder of the highway There is
silence as the engine idles calmly Then

BILLY
Sarah there is no excuse for what I did
But if I would have known about what
he did to you I would have killed that
monster a long time ago

Sarah looks ahead with a strange calm

SARAH
he lied Nothing happened (beat)
You’1l never know how sad it feels when a
guy says just what you want to hear but
none of it’s true Every kiss every
look nothing but a fairy-tale

BILLY
But it was true

Sarah half-laughs half cries at him saying that

SARAH
How do you get off saying that

BILLY
I was in love with you from the first
moment I walked into Stanleys No matter
what else I said no matter what else I
did that was always true It still is

Billy pulls out a rolled up canvas from the back seat and
hand it to Sarah

BILLY
Remember the painting
