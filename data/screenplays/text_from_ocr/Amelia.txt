EXT BAR LAE NEW GUINEA - DAY

CLOSE on a mud-streaked AIRFIELD in mist and driving

A Lockheed ELECTRA sits Sleek twin-engine state-of-
art its metallic surface battered by the monsoon

PULL BACK to see

our VIEW down onto the landing strip is from an open-
sided thatched roof BAR high above the airfield And

peering down through the mist and rain

a WOMAN in grimy flight clothes gazes at the plane
Slender Feminine At first glance fragile Then the

eyes change like the sea as a stray thought transforms
Something fierce lives there

Sure I cant talk you inta

somethin more adventurous
She turns FRED NOONAN is tall and lean ruggedly
in a reckless way His flight clothes as rumpled and

dirt-
streaked as her own He carries his bottle of tequila
and a
Coke which he sets down for her
AMELIA
Adventurous Youve got the wrong
girl Mister You should know that
by now
Her eyes study him Assessing something as he pours
himself
four fingers
FRED
Actually I knew that the moment I
met ol George
He sips his drink She says nothing
FRED (CONTD)
I like how you dont talk about
him
AMELIA
That why I get so many chances to
not do it
FRED
Well Natural curiosity
His charming smile Shes thinking more about the
tequila
She reaches to take his bottle and glass Moves them to
her
side of the table

FRED
I mean why would a guy who needs
to run the show Pick the one girl
he knew could kick his tail

No response Just her clear direct gaze

FRED (CONTD)
Ill bet he knew that First time
he met you

She looks out to sea
AMELIA

He thought I hated him He never
knew I was fascinated

INT GEORGES OFFICE NEW YORK - DAY

Alone by the window he gazes at the city A powerfully
built man in a perfectly-tailored suit The face at once
strong and elegant capable of every emotion Yet just
now
there are none to be seen Even as
»a door OPENS A pretty SECRETARY enters soundlessly
sits
respectfully Waits her pen suspended above her steno
pad
Does he know shes there
SUPERIMPOSE NEW YORK LATER 1937
GEORGE
(without turning)
The first time I met her she sat
in that chair
The secretary doesnt know whether to write that down
And

still with his back to her

GEORGE (CONTD)
You may as well write it down
Mary Write it all down Even the
parts that are confused or
graceless or boring
He turns with a soft smile to put her at ease

GEORGE (CONTD)
Well see if I remember how to
edit
She smiles back She likes him as much as her level of
being awed by him permits She begins to write as
one

and a

GEORGE (CONTD)
Id kept her waiting two hours

She hated me on sight but she
hought I couldnt tell

His gaze drifts to a bookcase crammed with volumes And

object oddly out of place A stuffed CAT with boots

green frock coat It wears a confident ironic smile

His smile

Hes made

GEORGE (CONTD)
She was a person who cherished her
privacy and was devoting her life
to social work And there I was
is kind And honestly self-mocking

GEORGE (CONTD)
Self-obsessed Wallowing in the
glory of my authors and celebrity
acquaintances A vain fast-
talking manipulator But then I
guess you know all that dont you

exam

She undoubtedly felt I was

importance
She doesnt look furious at all Thumbing through WE by

Louis in Paris

GEORGE (VO) (CONTD)
Actually I hadnt given her a
thought Oblivious as usual
Which perhaps was even worse
Now SKYWARD by ADM RICHARD BYRD Photos of the explorer
preparing for his flight over the North Pole One of Byrd
with George himself displaying considerable gravitas

AMELIA (VO)
I figured hed be pompous
Her eye travels over the stack of books Adventurers
explorers celebrities On an end table a framed photo of
George with the great Lindbergh
A pretty SECRETARY comes to summon her Amelia rises
smooths the wrinkles from her brown suit They head down
the corridor

AMELIA (VO) (CONTD)

I knew of course that he wasnt

going to choose me I had no

discernible qualifications

whatsoever
They reach the door already ajar It says GEORGE PALMER
PUTNAM on a small bronze plate The secretary gingerly
pushes it open

revealing George on the phone in crisp shirtsleeves and
suspenders He paces prowls trailing the cord behind him
negotiating non-stop even as he flips through a pile of
messages Off again stalking the room Dashing electric
masterful

AMELIA (VO)
But to be rejected by this
parasite A man who had given up
any life of his own to flutter near
the famous
He glances up realizing for the first time that she is
there Sit please But she doesnt

AMELIA (VO) (CONTD)

I didnt know whether to laugh or

throw something at the jerk
He gestures again more commandingly Sit She doesnt
move she doesnt smile She doesnt take her steady gaze
from him He hangs up the phone
They stare at each other for a frozen beat He breaks the
moment with a charming smile

GEORGE
Miss Earhart

AMELIA
Mr Putnam

GEORGE (softly)
I asked you to sit
AMELIA
Was that the thing you did with
your hand Sadly I dont speak

dog
His smile now only a trace But more genuine
GEORGE
A Ah Well stand if you like

melia sits

GEORGE (CONTD)
m told you want to fly the
Atlantic Ocean

AMELIA
do

GEORGE
n the 12 months since Lindbergh
55 people in 18 planes have tried
Three planes made it Fourteen
people have died

AMELIA
ll make it

GEORGE

Three women died trying Two

others escaped with their lives

£ you do make it youd be the
first Whichis the real
attraction for both of us I
suspect

She nods No smile

fq

AMELIA
Always nice to know what the real
attraction is
His smile Beginning to enjoy this conversation

GEORGE
The plane was bought from Adm Byrd
by Amy Guest a socialite who
wanted the record for herself Her
family wouldnt tolerate the
danger She has asked for a
replacement

He gestures Perhaps you

GEORGE (CONTD)
who is American educated well-
spoken a flyer preferably
physically attractive

AMELIA
Why would that matter

GEORGE
Because she wants the world to pay
attention And pretty girls
command more attention

AMELIA
Was that your advice

GEORGE
Sure My role is selling this
event to the public There will be
a contract for the girls story
with the New York Times Also a
book to be published over her name
Understood G

EORGE (CONTD)
But all the money from these will
go to Mrs Guest

AMELIA
Except for the part that goes to
you

GEORGE

Which will be as great as I can
manage I assure you

AMELIA
You said she wants a flyer

GEORGE
Dont get your hopes up The
celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be
the pilot Therell be a male co-
pilot and navigator The woman
will be purely a passenger

He waits for reaction She keeps her mouth shut

GEORGE (CONTD)

Thats good for your chances

Because your level of flying

experience wouldnt place you

anywhere near the group that would

be considered for this If the

woman were to do any flying at all
No punches pulled Not his style

AMELIA
Why would anyone want a book from a
passenger

GEORGE
Because the hook is that were
making the woman the commander
The pilot will sign a contract
saying he is under her direction
and control Its her ship her
flight

AMELIA
Good for my chances you said
What are my chan

GEORGE
The jobs yours
She blinks Stunned speechless

GEORGE (CONTD)
I chose you the moment you walked
through the door
He smiles his charming smile Several phones are RINGING

GEORGE (CONTD)
Now assuming my awful manners
havent soured you on the
enterprise May I give you a lift
to the station

Amelia rises Is she pissed at being toyed with
AMELIA
Youre a busy man Mr Putnam I
can find my way
The look holds He shrugs You probably can

INT GRAND CENTRAL STATION - LATER
Two figures on the platform Her train is ready to
leave
GEORGE
I honestly feel an apology is in
order
AMELIA
Fine What have I done

She watches his smile

AMELIA (CONTD)
I didnt mind waiting Caught up
on my reading Knitted a sweater

GEORGE
I mean an apology For whats
coming
His voice softens

GEORGE (CONTD)
Im going to be pretty controlling
these next few months How you
dress move cut your hair Speak
in public Its all part of the
package were selling
AMELIA
We

GEORGE
Thats right If youre not in
there selling with me it wont
work
The smile turns friendly

GEORGE (CONTD)
Youre the star Im no one at
all

AMELIA
Spoken like a gentleman
She steps up onto the train Extends her hand like a

man
He shakes it firmly The train begins to move She
watches
his cheery wave as she rolls away
AMELIA (VO) (CONTD)
Of course a gentleman Would have
paid for my ticket

INT TRAIN - LATER
Gazing out the window as she rattles toward Boston She
looks down now to a notebook in her lap As she flips
pages
we see it is a collection of hand-written POEMS and
thoughts

She writes

AMELIA (VO)
Courage is the price that life exacts
For granting peace

slender girl with her outstretched arms LOUDER and

INT HANGAR EAST BOSTON AIRPORT - NIGHT

he heavy door rolls OPEN George and Amelia enter the

brightly-lit hangar to see two men working on the
FRIENDSHIP

a sea-plane with golden wings Its red-orange fuselage

stands beside gigantic PONTOONS each 29 feet long The

pontoons have been opened and the men are attaching
them to

the plane

They turn toward us now BILL STULTZ is short and wiry
with

quick eyes Only 28 he seems weathered by his
adventures

and the streaks of gray through his hair He is not
necessarily happy to see us

AMELIA (VO)
George had told me Stultz was Adm
Byrds favorite pilot fearless
gifted He drank But George said
it never affected his work

George waves as we approach Bill and Amelia seem
locked on

each other

AMELIA (VO) (CONTD)
When he said it I must have had a
funny look So I just said “Yeh
I grew up around a guy like that

GEORGE
Boys Id like to introduce your
commander Miss Amelia Earhart

AMELIA
We felt ‘commander was less
grandiose than say ‘empress
Bill doesnt smile The other man does

GEORGE
Say hello to Slim Gordon your
navigator
calm

for

The pontoons

She is shaking hands in that strong

GEORGE (CONTD)

And Bill Stultz here simply the
most talented pilot working

their relationship

AMELIA
Hmmn What does that do to our
fuel

BILL

Costs us at least 400 gallons

Dont bother bringing clothes for
Paris well be lucky to hit the

nearest beach in Ireland Real
lucky

She does not seem admiring

GEORGE
The Admiral estimates the pontoons
only cut our range by 200 miles
But Amelia looks to Bill Thats not really possible is
it

BILL
The Admiral is the Admiral He
gets to estimate any damn thing he
wants All we have to do is figure
out how to fly without petrol
She turns to George with challenging eyes

BILL (CONTD)
Dont go blaming the bookseller
Hes been all through this with
Mrs Guest but she worships the
Admiral And its money that puts
planes in the air

AMELIA
I wonder if it can keep them up
there Not that Ive ever had
enough to try

Bills small smile Maybe the girls all right

EXT DOCK - LATER

No reaction from him He hops into the boat Turns
out his hand She hesitates Clearly doesnt need his
to jump into a boat Their eyes lock We are watching

scarcely recognize It is Elinor Though less than a

ANGLE A secretary leads Elinor down the corridor to
Georges office As they enter George is pacing on the
phone G
EORGE (into phone)
Because Amelia invented the Powder
Puff Derby for female pilots Then
the men running the damn race
suddenly decide every woman has to
carry a male navigator and start
from east of the Rockies so they
wont crash into the mountains
Listens impatient

GEORGE (into phone)
Ill tell you why its a front page
story Because Amelia pulled every
woman out of the race So the
organizers had to roll over and
give in or theyd have lost their
shirts You want me to write your
headline
He glances over Elinor in the doorway

GEORGE (into phone)
Call you back Ive got a very
important guest

He hangs up gesturing graciously for her to sit As she
does

ELINOR
Wish I was important enough for
you to manage

GEORGE
Well Ive just got one client
And most days shes more than I
can manage
Even Elinors smile seems older more capable of subtlety

ELINOR
Get in line behind the boys she
smacked around on the Derby
He grins back You bet

ELINOR (CONTD)
Some of the gal flyers had their
doubts about herwell her skill
level But shes everyones
champion now

GEORGE
And both of those things Are the
Ss reasons I called you
trange words He has her attention

GEORGE (CONTD)
I think it would be huge for women
flyers if Amelia won the Derby
The publicity would put the race
and all of you up there with the
boys

ELINOR
Im not sure she has much of a
chance Mr Putnam

GEORGE
Well the one shot would be putting
her in a far more powerful plane
than anything shes flown Were
thinking the Lockheed Vega

The girls shock He really means this

He smiles

ELINOR
Sir Ive test piloted the Vega
Its way more than she could ever
handle It wouldnt be safe let
alone successful

GEORGE
Thats why Im thinking of you
flying with her You could handle
the cross-country flying the more
difficult bits and Id pay you 75
a week

Elinor WHISTLES low

He stares at

ELINOR
Well I think thats the most
generous opportunity Ive ever
been offered
her

GEORGE
Theres just one thing Obviously
it has to appear that Amelia did
all the flying So when pictures
are taken youll stand off to one
side

Her eyes narrow Hes completely serious

N

ELINOR
In that case Ill get my own plane
and win the race myself

GEORGE
You havent changed

o smile at all

GEORGE (CONTD)
Unfortunately for you neither
have I
The look in his eye is not to be ignored

GEORGE (CONTD)
You cant win if you cant get a
plane to enter Let me predict
that you wont
The voice calm and low and riveting

GEORGE (CONTD)
In fact If you reject my
generosity you may come to regret
it For a long long time

ELINOR
Thats a threat

GEORGE
Im an intensely loyal person
Elinor And this is what my
loyalty requires
Shes glaring Reeling Trapped

ELINOR
Shes the one who said I shouldnt
let anybody turn me around

GEORGE
She probably meant me
So honest the words confuse her

ELINOR
Obviously she doesnt see me as
a threat

GEORGE

Oh sure she does
A straight smile

She just doesnt care
which silently fades
