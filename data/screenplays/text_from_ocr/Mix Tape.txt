NIGHT SKY

The winter stars impossibly big and bright fill the
sky We gaze on these ancient beacons of hope and
inspiration the same stars that stood witness to the
birth of kings inspired poets gave hope to the
hopeless Then we trace a silver string of starlight
down through the too-huge universe to where this
inspirational ancient and magical light comes to rest
on

Beer cans Milwaukees Best to be specific

The beer cans are frozen in a kiddie pool Next toa
broken trampoline In a yard with a rusted pick-up
truck Surrounded by many other yards decorated in much
the same manner and all of it covered in a layer of snow

Welcome to winter in SPOKANE WASHINGTON - a city
comprised of churches and strip bars equally - whos
chief export seems to be its endless supply of footage
for the Cops TV series

SOMEWHERE IN THE DISTANCE

A bottle rocket traces a green path across the star-
filled sky and then--

POP It explodes in a shower of green sparks A chorus
of barking dogs calls out--

INT BEVERLYS BEDROOM - NIGHT
The muffled sound of dogs barking outside--

In the dark a massive tangle of hair rises from the
pillow The light flicks on Beside the lamp a little
framed PICTURE OF A YOUNG COUPLE we dont get a good
look at it yet--

By the light of the lamp we can see the girl beneath the
bed-head BEVERLY MOODY chubby caught fully in
those awkward years She reaches up and tries her best
to regain some control over the mess she calls hair

OUT THE FROSTED-OVER WINDOW

All we can see is the blurred glow of light spreading and
then getting dimmer like some kind of mysterious magic as
another bottle rocket explodes Beverly climbs out of
bed Opens her window and sticks her head out

BEVERLYS POV
From some far house a red streak races up to the stars
and POP Explodes in a beautiful bloom of sparks
reflected in the snow below so that the ground looks like
a million red jewels dancing in the cruddy backyards

INSIDE

Beverly pulls a chair to the window and watches another
burst of color shower the dark houses below Another
chorus of dogs howl in the distance in some kind of
mysterious dog applause

MORNING

And Beverlys passed out in the same spot head resting
on the frame of the open window

A KNOCK at the door--
Beverly jolts awake - CRACKS her head against the window--

BEVERLY
Crap

INT KITCHEN TABLE - MORNING

Beverly sits at the table a perfect breakfast in front
of her - eggs bacon pancakes orange juice - the works
Standing over her is Beverlys grandmother GAIL MOODY
(55-65) She dabs at Beverlys head with rag while
Beverly speaks with that pre-teen girl intensity

BEVERLY
It was probably like the coolest thing I
ever saw Why doesnt everyone let off
fireworks in the snow We should move the
fourth of July to winter and then we
could always have fireworks in the snow

Gail while still pretty has the look of a woman whose
age is just beginning to catch up with her not so much
in wrinkles and gray hairs but in mannerisms and style
(or lack thereof) None of which is helped by her ill-
fitting postal workers uniform that gives her a definite
warden vibe

GAIL
Eat
Gail washes off the rag in the sink Beverly shoves some
pancake in her mouth and stares at her bacon thoughtfully-

BEVERLY
Do you think you could feed a pig bacon

Gail puts the rest of Beverlys breakfast in one big roll
of tin-foil

GAIL
I think youre going to be late for
school

EXT BEVERLYS HOUSE - MORNING

The worlds become a great gray-brown layer of snow
slushy Gail and Beverly move through it quickly -
shivering beneath their bundles of hats sweaters coats
and scarfs

Gails Postal Service van waits for them Gail jumps in
quickly and starts the engine Beverly pauses before
getting in taking a dramatic drag from an imaginary
cigarette like some awkward chubby Audrey Hepburn and
letting go of a puff of frosted breath

At the same time she catches sight of--
DOWN THE STREET

A Fussy ASIAN MOTHER shuffling her kids into a gigantic
SUV An ASIAN girl Beverlys age puts her hand up ina
kind of apathetic hello before being yelled at and
shuffled inside the car

GAIL
Move it Beverly

BEVERLY
(under her breath)
Okay Geeze

Beverly tosses her imaginary cigarette and hops in the
postal van

INT POSTAL VAN - CONTINUOUS

Some monotone political radio show buzzes while Gail

offers a grunt of approval - or more likely a snicker
of derision
We scan the back of the van for Beverly and at first we
dont even notice shes there Shes just another
overstuffed bag of hopes and dreams sitting immobile in
the back-seat The van goes over the bump and shes
jostled around like all the other bags of letters and
mail around her

She looks to a bag on her left and sees something
interesting A piece of air mail with the distinctive
red and blue border around it - the return address is
somewhere in France

One eye on Gail Beverly stealthily pulls the letter out
and slips it into her jacket

GAIL

(re the radio)
Cripes This is what I pay taxes for

EXT JAMES K POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - MORNING

A sign in front that reads James K Polk Junior High
accompanied by a less than flattering caricature of the
man himself with a full lions mane of a mullet Around
the sign are swarms of cold-looking kids - coming and
going and moving in every direction Its a well-
rehearsed school morning chaos

Gail rolls up the back door of the postal van revealing a
less than thrilled Beverly

GAIL
Special delivery

Beverly crawls out - looking like a condemned prisoner
This is not a kid that likes school

BEVERLY
Bye

Beverly watches Gails van disappear into the maze of
school traffic and then like a brave little prisoner
heads toward the entrance

MEAN KID (0S)
Hey blubberly

Beverly turns - WHAM A snow ball explodes against the
side of her face Beverly doesnt even flinch - this
obviously isnt the first time shes caught a snowball
with her face
MEAN KID
Special delivery

A group of kids LAUGHS Beverly keeps walking - head

down and fast like the weakest prisoner in the prison
yard which in a way she is

INT JAMES K POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAYS

That odd mix of kids that only exists in the Northwest
REDNECKS with confederate flag shirts PUNKS with combat
boots PREPPIES with messenger bags and HIPPIES with
flower dresses

Beverly still keeping her head down moves through the
crowds managing to not-quite-fit-in with any group

ABOVE THE MAIN ENTRANCE

A banner with a WILDCAT on one side and an OWL on the
other and in between

Vote for the School Mascot March 15th You decide

A rather unfortunate looking GIRL hands out Owl buttons
She hands one to Beverly--

GIRL
Vote Owl for mascot

BEVERLYS LOCKER
Beverly opens her locker right as--

STEVEN a-hole of the Junior High rolls up in his
wheelchair At his side is the vice-president of a-
holery DONNY a kid that got an early start on acne
Both wear Wildcat for Mascot buttons

STEVEN
She has an owl button

DONNY
Its not surprising The owl button is a
magnet for losers They cant resist its
pull

Beverly tries her best to ignore them

STEVEN
Do you smell that
DONNY
Ugh gawd yeah What is it

They both look around dramatically - then look at
Beverly

STEVEN
(to Beverly)
Do you by chance use Pert Plus

Meekly--

BEVERLY
Yeah

STEVEN
Thats what it is Jesus its
disgusting It smells like choad

DONNY
-- and poor people

STEVEN
Poor peoples choad

STEVEN
Lets get the foh before I puke

A disgusted look on his face Donny pushes Stevens
wheelchair away When theyre far enough away Beverly
smells her hair sheepishly

CLASSROOM

The GYM TEACHER is subbing in English A burly man
(40s) with a full sweat-pant outfit a gnarly mullet and
a whistle finishes writing on the board--

Poetry ROCKS

Beverly rushes into the room - only two seats left

One the SAFE SEAT in the middle of the room The other
in the back corner next to the scariest girl in school -
NICKY Dressed in all black busy drawing skulls in her

notebook

Beverly is about to sit down at the safe seat when
another MEEK LOOKING GIRL practically dives into it--
MEEK GIRL
(motioning towards Nicky)
Please dont make me sit back there

Beverlys about to say something when the Teacher spots
her standing in the middle of the room

TEACHER
You are

BEVERLY
Beverly

Looking down his list--

TEACHER
Beverly

BEVERLY

Moody
He makes a little mark in his notebook--

TEACHER
Ah there we are Well Moody you look
like a volunteer to me Why dont you
read us your assignment

BEVERLY
Um Okay

Beverly digs through her papers pulls out a notebook
flips through the pages and hands-shaking and out of
breath reads--

BEVERLY

Theres a dog next door I feed bologna
through the fence A dog across the
street whose owner forces him to wear
sweaters in the summer - it doesnt make
sense Theres a yellow lab thats blind
and deaf named Nutter And in an empty
lot behind the Ben Franklins theres a
dog buried there who died from eating a
whole tub of I Cant Believe its Not
Butter

(beat)
The end

The TEACHER claps - he looks around the room and keeps
clapping until others join in
TEACHER
Great Very uh Emily Dickinson-eque I
think Just great Okay whose next
Someone can volunteer or I can choose

Beverly makes her way back to the dreaded seat--
NICKY

Finishing a drawing of a snake eating a skull eating a
knife stabbing a snake in the eye Beverly tries to look
at it and Nicky gives her a dirty look and covers it up
like Beverlys trying to cheat off her math test

Beverly tries to nonchalantly smell her hair again -
Nicky looks over just in time to catch her in the act
holding her hair over her noise taking big whiffs
Nicky gives her a what the hell are you doing look
Beverly drops her hair embarrassed

TEACHER
Excellent a volunteer And you are

A SKIMPILY DRESSED GIRL stands up - well not exactly a
girl - more of a woman a full figured woman Its as if
she exists simply to show how very much a child Beverly
still is

The boys mouths open books go to laps The girls look
on jealously Without thinking Beverlys hands go to her
own not-yet-existent breasts

Again Nicky looks over just in time to catch her

NICKY
Are you feeling yourself up

Beverlys hands fly down to her desk--

BEVERLY
No--

NICKY
Yeah you definitely were--

BEVERLY
No I--

TEACHER
Okay ladies Enough with the chit and
the chat Time to open your ear-holes
and be a good audience
Nicky gives Beverly one last disgusted look--

NICKY
(whispering)
You have serious problems

TEACHER
Please begin

MATURE GIRL
The throbbing night humped my soul--

TEACHER
Okay Good Very very good

MATURE GIRL
Theres more

TEACHER
Yes I know Im sure it all rocked
Thats why Im moving on
(beat)
Okay whos next Someone can volunteer
or I can pick Anybody

A classroom of KIDS immediately look down Beverly lays
her head down on her desk

EXT JAMES K POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

More chaos - this time the after-school variety

Gails postal van pulls to the front of the school and
finds a spot among all the other waiting parents

INT POSTAL VAN

She takes a look at herself in the side mirror Her eyes
are red as if shes been crying She wipes them takes
a big breath and plants a big smile on her face as--

OUT THE WINDOW

Beverly makes her way toward the postal van Head down
defeated Beverlys almost there when - WHAM Another
snowball to the cranium Beverly pauses just for a
second just long enough to let it register then climbs
in

INT POSTAL VAN

Half a snowball still stuck to Beverlys head as she
moves to the back of the van Gail stops her - a slight
look of concern on her face that quickly gets replaced by
toughness Gail peels the snowball off of Beverlys
stocking cap--

GAIL
How was your day

Beverly shrugs - heads back to the back of the van and
lays down amongst the now empty bags looking just as
empty

BEVERLY
Same as every day

INT BEVERLYS HOUSE - DAY

The front door flies open then

INT BEVERLYS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - THE BASEMENT

Its a musty room orange-ish industrial carpeting lined
with piles and piles of boxes and lit by a single bulb
dangling down from the ceiling

A soda and potato chips at her side Beverly begins her
after-school ritual - playing out the days events

BEVERLY
(as Steven)
Only losers wear owl buttons

Beverly throws a punch into the air - looks down at an
imaginary opponent writhing on the ground

BEVERLY
Oh yeah Whos the loser now loser

UPSTAIRS

Gail sits on the couch with the TV blaring A LOUD THUD
comes from the basement Gail hits mute and listens to
the mumblings and rumblings coming from her granddaughter
downstairs

She gets up walks to the basement door like she has a
hundred times before - and then puts her ear to the door
More ramblings from downstairs

Gail goes to open the door to go down there and talk to
her granddaughter - just like she has probably everyday -
but something in her just wont do it

THE BASEMENT
Beverly continues the show--

BEVERLY
Excuse me Did you just say I smell like
choad Did you No I know what you
said You said I smelled like choad
Okay well how does this smell

Beverly swings around and kicks - right into a stack of
boxes it falls into another stack and down they go
dominoes style--

All Beverly can do is sit there and watch as a wall of
boxes goes crashing to the ground

BEVERLY
SHITake mushrooms

LATER

Beverly stuffs Christmas decorations back into a box
Tinsel and lights all tangled together a reindeer with
its head broke off

She starts on the next box - mostly what looks like bills
and then something else - something special--

A MIXTAPE CASE

The cover has a an anatomical skeleton cut out froma
text-book with a heart drawn in red in its ribcage
Above it is written New Beginnings and below it is
written The Sarah loves Zach Mix

Beverly opens up the tape case - the tape is still there

She digs through the box - not finding what she wants she
dumps it And there it is - a Walkman held together with
a rubber band She hits the radio - the batteries still
work

Beverly puts the tape in the Walkman She stops a second
to absorb whats happening--

This is her wardrobe to Narnia her invitation to
Hogwarts This is where the adventure begins and
somewhere deep down inside Beverly can sense it--

She pushes play

And waits She strains her ears Then that familiar
hiss of a cassette tape beginning followed by one strum
of a guitar before

A HORRIBLE SCREECHING SOUND--

Beverly opens the Walkman The tape hangs out like a
corpse hopelessly tangled and definitely destroyed

BEVERLY
No

But all is not lost - she turns the tape cover over
revealing a list of songs Exotic sounding bands and
songs Carnival by Bikini Kill and Teachers Pet by
The Quick And then others that arent songs at all -a
listing that says The song that reminds me of that day
in the park and the last song The parental units
happy song

And around all of the songs are hand-drawn fireworks
swirling up and exploding--

BEVERLY
Fireworks

Beverly stuffs the list in her pocket

UPSTAIRS
Beverly races by the sofa toward the upstairs--

GAIL
I heard something fall What was it

BEVERLY
Nothing

Gail goes to say something but Beverlys already racing
loudly up the stairs--

BEVERLYS ROOM

Beverly practically dives under her bed While shes
under there we get a better look at the picture beside
her bed a young punk couple pierced dyed hair the boy
holds a beer the girl a cigarette Theyre cool in that
grunge way We dont know it yet but these are Bevs
parents

Beverly re-emerges from under the bed with a beaten-up
converse shoebox She opens it up revealing the
contents

A couple of pictures - of that same couple as in the
picture sitting by Beverlys bedside - a small notebook
and lots and lots of unopened mail that Beverlys
pilfered with addresses from all over the world

Beverly deposits her newest letter - the piece of air
mail from France Then she pulls out one particular
picture - a picture of that same hipster couple holding a
little smiling baby while fireworks explode in the sky
above them She sets it beside the mixtape decorated
with fireworks and opens the small notebook and writes--

Mixtape New beginnings Fireworks

INT FOOD LION - CONTINUOUS

We can hear Beverly and Gail before we see them--

The shopping carts wheels - SCREECH SCREECH SCREECH
Gail steers past the bread aisle past the frozen foods

past the canned foods past the--

Beverly stops Gail keeps going

THE SHAMPOO AISLE

Bottles of shampoos of every variety Beverly sniffs a
bottle of Orange blossom

BEVERLY
Mm-mmm

A bottle of Tea-tree oil and lavender

BEVERLY
Ahhh

A bottle of Jasmine and Melon Blossom A picture of a
beautiful woman flipping her hair on the bottle with the
words - Smell Gorgeous

BEVERLY
(reading)
Smell gorgeous

REFRIGERATED SECTION

Beverly runs up to Gail clutching her bottle of Jasmine
and Melon Blossom shampoo--

GAIL
Pick out some Lunchables

Beverly drops the shampoo in the cart Gail immediately
plucks it out--

GAIL
Whats this

BEVERLY
Shampoo

Holds it out to Beverly--

GAIL
We already have shampoo

BEVERLY
But this one smells really good

GAIL
We can discuss it when we finish the
shampoo we have

BEVERLY
But weve had that bottle for like two
years and its still half full

GAIL
I said no Beverly Now pick out some
Lunchables and lets get home before
Deal or No Deal comes on

Gail puts the shampoo on the shelf among the hotdogs and
lunch meat and squeaks away Beverly picks up the
shampoo and follows her

REGISTER

The usual crowded line of impatient shoppers--

Gail is busy thumbing through her coupons Beverly loads
items onto the check-out counter - including the Jasmine
and Melon Blossom shampoo

The CHECKER scans milk Five Lunchables The bottle of
shampoo

GAIL
What is that
CHECKER

With finality--

GAIL

shampoo at home

BEVERLY

choad

Everyone in line stops what theyre doing stares at
Beverly in shock Gails mouth is wide open--

CHECKER
It does smell kind of nasty

INT CAR - CONTINUOUS
Gail - still fuming

GAIL
Where did you hear a word like that

Beverly doesnt answer--

GAIL
Answer me Beverly Moody Where did you
hear that word

BEVERLY
Nowhere

GAIL

As far as Im concerned you can use Pert

Plus until youre eighteen
Beverly steams the window with her breath and writes
CHOAD against the glare of passing headlights
INT POSTAL VAN - MORNING
Gail grumbles at the radio Beverly sits in the back
looking like the queen of the sad sacks amongst the mail
bags
EXT SCHOOL TRACK - DAY
The same TEACHER as in English class surveys the class
Everyone doing laps Beverly gets to the end of the
track and just keeps running - off the track and past the
school

EXT WAL-MART - DAY

Beverly marches along a busy street and into the store

INT WAL-MART - CONTINUOUS

A CLERK looking just out of high school pretends to
work - scanning various things at random--

He walks by Beverly and scans her

HIGH SCHOOL CLERK
799

BEVERLY
What

HIGH SCHOOL CLERK
The scanner says youre worth 799

Beverly looks offended--

HIGH SCHOOL CLERK
No thats good Im only worth 399

A SECOND CLERK emerges - a humongous woman with a badge
that reads Hello Im Ruth

RUTH
Will you please leave this girl alone and
do some work

HIGH SCHOOL CLERK
(to Beverly)
Shes just mad cause shes only worth
fifty cents
Swatting at him with a huge hand--

RUTH
Lou Im not gonna tell you again

High School Clerk continues his rounds - scanning things
absently Ruth turns to Beverly as sweet as can be--

RUTH
I cant find anything by that artist

Ruth hands the song list back to Beverly
RUTH
But I think we might have CDs by some of

the other artists

BEVERLY
It has to be the first one

Off of Ruths confused look

BEVERLY
It has to be in order

RUTH
Well Im sorry sweetie We dont carry
that song

BEVERLY

Do you know who would

RUTH
You could try the Westside Wal-Mart
They tend to have a little bigger music
selection

EXT WAL-MART - CONTINUOUS

Beverly walks out into the sea of minivans and SUVs
kids in shopping carts and frazzled moms

CLERK (0S)
Hey Girl Hey 799

Beverly turns around the Clerk jogs toward her--

CLERK
Let me see that list

Beverly hesitates--

CLERK
If they dont have the songs here it
must be something good

She hands him the list He looks it over smiles

CLERK
This is really radI know where you can
find the first song Maybe all the
songs

EXT STREET - DAY

A crummy record store on a crummy street A train roars
by behind it

INT RECORD STORE - DAY

Beverly pushes the door open setting off an
extraordinarily loud bell Its filled with CDs

records posters of bands weve never heard of - a few we
havebut no customers

Beverly moves cautiously through the store - does a lap
and returns to the counter to find a menacing but frumpy-
looking guy behind it

This is ANTI - 40s - aging hipster rocker and rebel
He looks like a mix between Henry Rollins and your creepy
Uncle whos always asking your parents for money

BEVERLY
Im looking for a song

ANTI
What an amazing impossible coincidence
I sell songs

The sarcasm zips by Beverly Confused she simply holds
out her song list Anti takes it - a visible shift in
his countenance from harsh to well slightly less
harsh

ANTI
Not bad Sequencing needs work Whats
this The song that reminds me of that
time in the park

BEVERLY
UmI dont really know I thought it
was a song

ANTI
Whered you get this You steal it off
somebody

BEVERLY

Its my parents - the tape broke Now I

ANTI
Youre parents have some good taste I

Anti starts making his way through the story plucking
records from their spots--

BEVERLY
I just need the first one for now

ANTI
(reading the list)
Carvinal - Bikini Kill
(MORE)

ANTI (CONTD)
You want vinyl or CD Id go vinyl if

Anti pulls a record out--

BEVERLY
Do you have it on tape

Off Antis perplexed look--

BEVERLY

Anti looks out the window toward the street - looking for
something--

BEVERLY
What are you looking for

ANTI
I was looking for your Delorean The
flux capacitor acting up again Cant
just pop back into 80s and pick the tape
up there

Beverly looks at him blankly--
ANTI
Back to the Future The car
Nevermindhow much money you got
Beverly rummages nervously through her pockets Pulls
out some sweaty bills and change - puts it in Antis

hand He sets the money down - disgusted

BEVERLY
Im sorry I was sweating

ANTI
Wonderful Wait here

Anti takes the record and disappears into a back room

ANTI (0S)
And dont steal anything

CUT TO

RECORD STORE - LATER

Beverly looks through the album covers Fantastic images
of fantastic people in all sorts of dangerous looking
poses Anti emerges - tape in hand

ANTI
I recorded the song for you on an old
tape I had The rest of it is from an AA
talk Thats free of charge Good
stuff If you ever want to get clean

He hands her the tape Beverly beams back at him Anti
scribbles on a piece of paper--

ANTI
Well say a dollar for a used tape - a
dollar for the song laborcarry the
four Pythagorean theorem With tax your
total comes to

He counts out the money
ANTI

Five damp dollars and sixty-three sweaty
cents Exactly

ANTI

Beverly cant tell if hes grinning or grimacing as she
heads out the door

EXT BEVERLYS HOUSE - DAY

Beverly runs from the Postal Van into the house Gail
watches her go totally perplexed

BEVERLYS ROOM

Beverly bursts into her room - grabs the ancient Walkman
off of her desk and puts the tape in She presses play
and waits

The drums kick in - the guitars rip through the
earphones Beverly looks a little shocked Pushes stop

and looks down at the Walkman

BEVERLY
Holy crap

She puts the headphones back on hits play and the music
blares

EXT JAMES K POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

Beverly stands in front of school like a gunfighter at
noon She pulls her Walkman out of her bag Puts her
head-phones around her neck Checks the tape inside
Secure

And walks inside--

INT JAMES K POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL

The Jungle

Kids scream running through the halls Pushing
Shoving Name-calling Papers flying

Beverly puts the headphones over her ears She presses
play and as the music comes in--

Something magic happens

Everyone moves in slow motion as if in time to the
music The entire mood of the hallway changes from
violent to welcoming Students smile and wave the
pubescent chaos parts before Beverly as she walks down
the hall
BEVERLYS LOCKER

Steven rolls up in his wheelchair with Donny in tow

Beverly looks over at them - the music blaring from her
headphones a huge smile on her face

She speaks loud over the sound in her headphones--

And walks away happy

BEVERLY
HEY GUYS

along her way--

STEVEN

What a goat scrotum

EXT SCHOOL TRACK - ANOTHER DAY

More laps

Steven watches her go happily

Again Beverly hits the end of the track and
keeps right on going--

INT RECORD STORE - DAY

Beverly walks in - waves happily to Anti

Anti just looks at her

BEVERLY
Hi Anti

BEVERLY
That was probably the best song Ive ever
heard in my entire life I have to have
the next one

Anti stares at her blankly--

BEVERLY
I brought the tape and everything And
Ive got like--
(pulls out some change)
--three dollars and--

ANTI
Listen Moody Im not in the mix making
business I sell records and CDs And
Im sorry but your lunch money isnt
going to buy anything in this store

Beverly takes out the list -

BEVERLY
Maybe I could work for you I could come
here and like sweep or organize stuff

ANTI
Sorry kid but you scare the customers
away The last thing people want to see
when they go to a cool record store such
as this hip establishment is a pre-teen
girl in junior high gym clothes

BEVERLY
But you never even have customers

ANTI
My point exactly

BEVERLY
Please

ANTI
Compelling argument but no This is
your parents mix-tape correct So lI

suggest you pester them for the music

An awkward beat One very large tear forms in Beverlys
eye

ANTI
What Whats wrong with your eye What
are you doing

BEVERLY
I cant ask my parents Theyre gone

Anti cringes--

ANTI
Gone like to the store to get a gallon
of milk

Beverly doesnt answer But that very large tear rolls
down her cheek

ANTI
Im sorry I-- dont cry Jesus okay
hold on--

He grabs the mixtape and disappears into the backroom
We can hear him mumbling to himself but we cant quite
make out what hes saying

He re-emerges and gives her the tape

ANTI
There you go kid Linda Linda Linda
by the Bluehearts

She wipes her face and holds out her change--

ANTI
Naw keep your buttons and bottle-caps
for a bagel pizza and green jello at the
cafeteria

BEVERLY
Thanks Anti

ANTI
Youre welcome Moody Now if youll
excuse me I need to return some Christmas
presents to Whoville

EXT JAMES K POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

Lunchtime and sure enough Beverly is eating a bagel
pizza and green jello Some things never change She
takes out her Walkman puts the tape in and listens

VOICE
--youre traveling a road thats full of
pot-holes Those pot-holes being the
heart-break the disappointment and hurt
in your life What so many of us try to
do is patch up this road with alcohol and
drugs - but what we should be doing is
paving a new road

The voice cuts off - the tape begins to hiss--

The drums kick in The guitars kick in Then the singer
begins to sing - but its not in English - its Japanese

ON BEVERLY

Looking thoroughly confused She looks at the song
listing again Linda Linda Linda - The Blue Hearts
EXT BEVERLYS HOUSE - MORNING

The first signs of spring The snow is slowly retreating

to become muddy puddles An arm falls off a melting sad
looking snow-man--

INT BEVERLYS ROOM - MORNING

Blinds conceal the bright light of morning Beverly
snores lightly the Walkman beside her on the bed

Somewhere outside someone starts shouting--

BOYS VOICE
Its Saturday everybody Its Saturday

Beverly gets up - opens her curtains--
DOWN THE STREET

At the Asian house - the Boy is outside his window on the
roof doing a dance and singing his song about Saturday in
his Spider-man pajamas

BOY
Its Saturday for sheezy my neezies
Anarchy Attica

And then he pulls down his drawers and moons the
neighborhood His Mom bursts out the front door and
starts hollering at him The Asian girl her head out of
the other upstairs window laughs hysterically

Finally the DAD reaches out the Boys window and yanks
him back inside
EXT ROAD - DAY

Gails postal van cruises up to a line of mail-boxes

INT POSTAL VAN - DAY

Beverly grabs a gob of mail from a bag She notices a
letter from India and discreetly stuffs it in her
pocket The rest of the mail gets handed off to Gail who
crams the junk-mail and bills unceremoniously into the
boxes

Then its off to the next group of houses--
They turn past a yard with a cardboard sign with the

message Free Kittens to LOVING home scrawled in awful
child-like handwriting

Beside the sign is the advertised box-full-of-kittens
And sitting on a lawn-chair beside the box is a mom with
a crying little girl in her lap holding one of the
kittens

BEVERLY
Can I get a kitten

GAIL
Youre allergic

BEVERLY
How do you know

GAIL
Genetics

Beverly thinks about it

BEVERLY
Mom and dad were allergic to kittens

Gail just nods her head and pulls up to the next mailbox

INT BEVERLYS BEDROOM - DAY

Beverly opens the converse box drops in her newest
letter and pulls out her notebook--

At the edge of the park a large rusted sign that reads
World Expo 1974 Spokane Washington
Around the park are the rusted Expo leftovers An
ancient looking merry-go-round A huge pavilion
Gondolas gliding over the Spokane river Huge metal
sculpture butterflies
And another leftover--

I printed out directions
(reading)
Light the joint Inhale and hold Then
slowly exhale the marijuana smoke

Beverly takes the joint and carefully obeys the
instructions She lights it She sucks on it She
holds the smoke in--

Ellen and Nicky watch as Beverly holds it and holds it
And then Beverly lets it out - coughing hacking and
gagging

NICKY
How was it

Still coughing - Beverly gives a thumbs up

Then Beverly turns and nods to Nicky Nicky nods back--
NICKY

Ellen and Beverly run to her side screaming The Hip

The three girls look innocently at Anti

BEVERLY

ANTI
What time should I pick you ladies up

EXT ELLENS HOUSE - NIGHT

A window opens A figure climbs out the window followed
by another and then another Three silhouettes run
across the yard and down the street

ANTIS CAR

Parked under a street lamp Anti leans against it in the
coolest pose he can muster--

THE CAR

Looks like its been pieced together from three other
slightly less crappy cars

ANTI
All teeny-boppers in the backseat

INT ANTIS CAR - NIGHT

While the outside looks like recycled garbage - the
inside specifically the stereo looks like something
from a sci-fi movie The stereo itself is probably worth
10 times the price of the car

ELLEN
Are you aware that this middle seatbelt
is broken

Anti turns up his stereo - lights flicker speakers
pound

NICKY
Are you aware that your car smells like
mushrooms

Anti turns up the stereo even more - drowning out the
girls

CUT TO

CAR - LATER

The highway scenery zooms by An album ends Anti
starts looking for a new song on his stereo

NICKY
How about one of Bevs songs now

ANTI
Sorry children This car does not come
with a tape player

ELLEN
I have some of them on my ipod

Begrudgingly--

ANTI
Okay what song

ELLEN
Just play the album marked Bev

A song begins something melancholy and beautiful and

its like the entire world is moving to the beat of the
song--

The street lights pass overhead to the beat of the drums--

Nicky moving her hand out the window against the wind
seems to move to the sound of the guitars--

A couple in a car passing by seem to be singing the
lyrics to one another--

As the song reaches its climax Ellen yawns widely along
with the roar of the song

CUT TO

LATER - STILL IN THE CAR

Now its a fast paced song - something bursting with
energy Everyone sings along as loud and as happy as
they can - even Anti

And then Beverly IMAGINES

Its her parents in the front seat singing along They
smile back at her Mom plays air guitar while her Dad
drums on the steering wheel

Beverly returns to REALITY

Shes beaming and Nicky is screaming the lyrics at the
top of her lungs with Ellen convulsing with laughter and
Anti cranking up the volume

EXT THE VOYEUR - NIGHT

The roar of guitar feedback inside--

The girls follow Anti through a smattering of hipsters
and rockers smoking and talking outside the club

BEVERLY
(nervously to Nicky)
Is this your first concert

NICKY
No

BEVERLY
Its mine

NICKY
Yeah I know

Anti walks up to the doorman--

ANTI
Tommmy

TOMMY is an old-time rocker He hasnt been sober since
the nineties and his appearance reflects it--

TOMMY
Holy shit Anti I havent seen you in

ANTI

Anti
ANTI

Yes dearest daughter

BEVERLY
You cant just leave us here

ANTI
You wanted a ride So here you are Now
Im going to go enjoy myself

The first chords of some song begin and people start
filing inside

Cigarettes are flung conversations dropped in mid-
sentence - and within a minute the girls are the only
ones still outside

Tommy looks at the girls

TOMMY
So you dudes are sisters

NICKY
Uh yeah genius us dudes are sisters

LATER

The music blasts from the building The walls thump the
windows shake The three girls sit by the front door

ELLEN
If you put your face against the wall and
put your palms out like this--
(she demonstrates )
Its almost like youre inside

Nicky rolls her eyes--

NICKY
Fuck this
(to Tommy )
Dont be a drag dude Just let us in

TOMMY
I cant

NICKY
Come on just for a second Well just
stand inside the door

Hes giving in--

ALL THREE GIRLS
Pleeeeaaaaase

TOMMY
Alright fine But just for a second

Tommy takes a quick look around - the coast is clear He
opens the door and ushers the girls inside shutting the
door behind them

He counts to three in his head and opens the door again

TOMMY
Okay seconds up--

But the girls are no longer there

INT CLUB - CONTINUOUS

The girls navigate their way through the bodies to the
front of the stage The music blares on - a deafening
onslaught of white noise Finally they get close enough
so they can actually see the band

The band hammers on their instruments indiscriminately

The singer lurches across the stage screaming into the

mic At one point it comes unplugged but he just keeps
screaming He trips over a case of beer at the edge of

ONE BY ONE

The girls make their way across the yard and hop back
into Ellens window

INT ELLENS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Ellen snores quietly Nicky rolls over in her sleep
Only Beverly is awake She pulls out the picture of her
parents - she can barely see it by the moonlight She
stares at it - looking for any sign of who they were
Could they really be as awful as he said

And then--

POP

Red light spills through the window--

Beverly jumps up - looks out the window to see the
falling red sparks of a bottle rocket She opens the
window

Nicky wakes up

NICKY
Whats going on

As if in answer--
POP
Another shower of sparks float down to earth

BEVERLY
Its a sign
NICKY

Its a sign - I have to find out where
its coming from

Beverly hops out the window

OUTSIDE

Nicky hops down on the grass Ellen pokes her head out

the window

ELLEN
You guys - its like four oclock We
should be asleep

NICKY
Then go to sleep

Beverly and Nicky cross the yard to the street Ellen

struggles through the window - falling into the grass
with a thud

ELLEN
(whispering)
Hey guys - wait up
OVER A FENCE
And into someones yard The three girls in their
pajamas scamper through a silent swing-set and some
toddler toys over the next fence and into--

THE NEXT YARD

Like a garden of Eden - a koi pond at the center and
around it trees and shrubs beautifully manicured--

ABOVE
Another POP and a burst of color rains down--

NICKY
This way

The girls run through the topiary--

ANOTHER YARD

A cocker-spaniel takes off after them--

ELLEN
Oh god oh god

The girls sprint for the fence and just barely make it
over - leaving the dog barking wildly behind them--

YARD WITH A CAR ON BLOCKS

In the center We can hear voices coming from the next
yard over

MANS VOICE
Ah shut the hell up

WOMANS VOICE
You wanna go to jail again Cause
thats exactly whats gonna happen They
warned you once - they aint gonna warn
you again

MANS VOICE
I can do whatever the hell I want in my
own goddamn backyard

The girls creep up and put their faces against the cracks
in the fence--

GIRLS POV A MAN in his boxers sets up another bottle
rocket with beer in hand A WOMAN stands in the doorway
in her nightgown smoking a cigarette
In Beverlys eyes they become her parents
WOMAN
I aint taking care of your cat when you
go to jail

The Man throws an empty beer can at the Woman

WOMAN
Fuck you

MAN
Well fuck you too

She slams the door closed The Man opens another beer
and lights a cigarette He touches the cigarette to the
bottle rocket fuse

BEVERLY
Walks away from the fence

ELLEN
Beverly Are you okay

BEVERLY
I thought it was a sign

NICKY
Maybe it is

Ellen shoots Nicky a Shut-up look POP Another
shower of sparks--

BEVERLY
There arent any signs My parents were
druggies and now theyre dead That
mixtape is stupid Its just a bunch of
stupid songs

ELLEN
But--

BEVERLY

Beverly starts climbing the fence--

NICKY
Beverly--

BEVERLY
Just leave me alone

And she disappears over the fence while another bottle
rocket EXPLODES in the sky above

worthy goal

PRINCIPAL (CONTD)
But it requires a lot of work You need

dressed up in really cute pink dress and
then a little puppy gets dressed up in a
little tux and they go to baby animal
prom together And theres like a baby
chick dating a baby bunny wearing
sunglasses and stuff like that

Beverly highlights the next song leaving one more - the
one marked only as The Parental Units Song

BEVERLY IN BED

Headphones on while the mixtape plays She holds her
parents picture above her - looking for some clue
something in the picture that will unravel the mystery of
who they are

Then she notices something shes never noticed before A
blurry number on the house behind her parents

The same house but now painted a kind of brown Shes

Gail pulls over--

Beverly holds the picture up to the house for comparison
Its older and more run-down now but its definitely the
same house

She looks at Gail Gail nods slightly sadly - as if to
say Go on

The Old Man takes a deep drag

OLD MAN
Your grandmother put you up to this

Beverly shakes her head No

OLD MAN

He breaks into a violent coughing fit Beverly looks
afraid

OLD MAN
I dont have any money if thats what

anything to you

She hands him the song list He looks at it--

busy harassing someone else

Beverly digs through her locker when the unthinkable
happens

Beverly FARTS Not a quiet fluff - but a full-on locker-
shaker of a fart Donny and Steven immediately look at
Beverly as if these two needed ammunition to make her
life hell--

STEVEN
Oh My God

Beverlys eyes meet Stevens In an instant she sees
what this means years and years of teasing never
hearing the end of this day Steven goes to say
something when--

Bam

Beverly punches him in the face knocking him out of his
wheelchair

INT PRINCIPALS OFFICE - DAY

Beverly and Gail side by side in the Principals office
again

Principal clears his throat uncomfortably--

PRINCIPAL

I want to say first that passing gas is
nothing to be embarrassed about
Everyone passes gas I pass gas Your
grandmother passes gas Even former
President of the United States James K
Polk passed gas

(beat)
Having said that it is unacceptable to
punch someone in the face regardless of
how embarrassed you might feel about
something you shouldnt be embarrassed
about And certainly not handicapped
people

Beverly lets out a bitter little snort of dissent

PRINCIPAL
Is there something youd like to say
Beverly

BEVERLY

I didnt punch him because I farted

PRINCIPAL
I dont appreciate that language but
okay Why did you hit him then

BEVERLY
I punched him because hes a big dick who
gets away with everything because hes in
a freakin wheelchair

EXT PRINCIPALS OFFICE
Principal opens the door and walks Gail and Beverly out--

PRINCIPAL
Im sorry Mrs Moody But Beverly really
left me no choice Well meet again

As Beverly walks out she notices Steven sitting with his
Mom and Dad - two perfect beautiful parents hanging over
their dear delicate son They both turn and scowl at
Beverly

A silent ride home Beverly sneaks a look at Gail But
Gail keeps her eyes glued to the road

INT BEVERLYS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Gail sets her purse on the couch and keeps walking into
the kitchen Beverly stands there - expecting maybe
even hoping for Gail to say something

KITCHEN

Gail is busy cooking Beverly enters--

BEVERLY
What are you doing

GAIL
Making dinner

BEVERLY
Arent you going to yell at me

Gail shrugs

BEVERLY

Gail keeps cutting vegetables

BEVERLY
Arent you going to say anything

Without looking up--

A beat Beverly stares at her cutting vegetables calmly
Going silently about her routine like shes done for
years now--

BEVERLY
(screaming)
The world is a shitball

Gail finally looks up

GAIL
Excuse me

BEVERLY
The world is a ball of shit and its
filled with crap and assholes and choad
and mean grandpas and dicks in
wheelchairs and stupid wildcat buttons
and crappy bands with asshole singers and
then more crap and

Tears pour down Beverlys cheeks Gail takes Beverly
into her arms

GAIL
Okayokay

BEVERLY
(through sobs)
I thought they were trying to tell me
something I thought they left the
mixtape for me

Gail lifts Beverlys face--
GAIL
I think its time I showed you something
INT GAILS ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Gail opens the bottom drawer in her dresser--
GAIL
Theres a box underneath my bed I
wanted to show you this earlier But
its hard for meyour parents death
Underneath the underwear Gail pulls out a record
Beverly brings out the box Gail opens it and pulls out

a record player

Gail plugs the record player in--

GAIL
This was your moms favorite song when
she was just a little girl I would
always play it for her and wed dance
Later when she thought she was too cool
for it she just called it the parental
units song

Gail starts the record and sits down on the bed next to
Beverly The record cracks and pops and hisses and
finally the song starts--

Its Happy Times are Here Again performed by Guy
Lombardo

Gail takes Beverlys hand in hers as she begins crying
And then they hug each other and begin sobbing as the
singer sings--

Happy times are here again

EXT BEVERLYS HOUSE - BACK STEPS - NIGHT

Gail and Beverly watch the rain come down in the back
yard and sip on mugs of hot chocolate

GAIL
Your mother came home one day and told
me Mom Im in love I thought it was

one of those things you know And then
when I met your father I could have
died He had piercings and tattoos and
purple hair I thought he looked like a
Star Wars character

Gail laughs at the thought of it--

GAIL
But he was good to your mother and they
were in love And then when they found
out they were having you - well
everyone including me thought they were
too young But they wouldnt hear it
They were so excited I remember your
father somehow found a bunch of fireworks
and he and your mother sat out here and
let off fireworks and listened to music
all night to celebrate I thought they
were crazy

Gail stares off into the rain and smiles - as if she can
actually see the fireworks arching off into the darkness
lighting up the sky

GAIL
They wanted to be good parents to you
They loved you more than anything in the
world You were everything to them

Gail puts her arm around Beverly Beverly puts her head
on her grandmothers shoulder both of them thinking
about two people they love very much

We follow their gaze up to--

THE SKY

Where the rain has stopped and the clouds have started to

part revealing the bright perfect stars glimmering from
the other side of the too-huge universe

EXT JAMES K POLK MIDDLE SCHOOL - MORNING

The sun is out One of those beautiful days where
everythings sparkling and green from the nights rain

Gails postal van pulls up to the curb Gail gets out
circles to the back of the van and slides the door open--

GAIL
Special del--
(stops herself)
Were here

Beverly hops out followed by Ellen

BEVERLY
Thanks Grandma

ELLEN
Thanks Mrs Moody

Ellen puts her hand up for a high-five Gail looks
confused Then figures out what Ellen is doing and puts
her hand up Ellen gives her an enthusiastic high-five

GAIL
Have a good day girls

Gail goes back to the drivers side - but stops and
watches as--

THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL

Beverly and Ellen meet up with Nicky - and then the three
of them meet up with THREE BOYS who look just as much
like misfits as the girls

A CHUBBY BOY and Beverly look at each other shyly He
gives Beverly a note as Nicky gives one of the other boys
a piggy-back and they all go inside the school

ON GAIL

Lets out a big sigh - knowing very well all the changes
and challenges coming in the next few years A look of
worry and weariness on her face as she climbs--

INSIDE THE VAN
--and finds something waiting on her seat A MIX CD
The cover has a collage of pictures of Gail and Beverly

along with the mix name - Grandmas Mix On the floor
next to her seat is a little CD player boombox

Gail puts the CD in The disc spins as Gail starts the
car and pulls away from the school And then the song
starts - the first chords of Cheap Tricks Surrender

Gail listens as the singer belts out the first lyrics
And then slowly almost against her will one of her
fingers starts tapping

If we didnt know better we might think she actually
likes this song

LATER

Gails stopped at a red light The climax of Surrender
blasts out of the little boombox She taps the beat on
the steering wheel bobs her head back and forth to the
roar of the guitar Shes starting to get into this
song And then

she starts to SING ALONG to the chorus Quietly at
first - not even audible above the boombox Then LOUDER
and LOUDER as the song starts to pick up steam And
before long shes SHOUTING along to the chorus - letting
everything shes been holding inside get out truly
feeling each word--

GAIL
Surrender Surrender But dont give
yourself awaaaaaaaaaay Awaaaaaay

She looks over to the car next to her A MAN and his
WIFE stare at her like shes crazy

Gail lets out a LAUGH - a real from the belly laugh -
for the first time in a long long time And we know
right at that moment that no matter what happens Gail
and Beverly are going to be just fine

The light turns green Gail waves to the couple and
drives away as the next song roars to life

INT BEVERLYS HOUSE - DAY
Hands over Beverlys eyes--

Gail brings out a birthday cake with 13 candles lit

Beverly sits down next to Gail

The first firework takes to the sky - a red streak rising
up into the darkness and then--

POP

EXT PARK - FLASHBACK

Close-up on Beverly as a baby followed by the sizzle and
pop of fireworks

Music plays in the background

Beverlys Dad bends over to light another bottle rocket
Mom stands at a distance holding infant Beverly

MOM
I think she likes the fireworks

DAD
How do you know Babies cant smile

MOM
I just have the feeling she does And
shes not crying

More fireworks are set off Beverly almost seems to be
following the fireworks with her eyes

Dad pulls two cans from a case of Rainier and hands one
to Mom

DAD
Lets make a toast

MOM

(looking at Beverly)
To new beginnings

They toast with their cans And as another firework
bursts in mid-air--

CUT TO

Everyone Ooohs and Aaaahs as the sparks float back
down to earth
