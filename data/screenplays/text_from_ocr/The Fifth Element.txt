OMAR and his mule zigzag along the bottom of sun scorched dunes
2 EXT TEMPLE EXCAVATION - DAY

The mule and the boy finally reach a camp A few tents dwarfed
by a huge
temple door jutting out of the sand The camp is deserted except for
some kids by the temple entrance holding large mirrors reflecting
light
into the temple

Omar leaves his mule in the shade seizes two goatskins and slips
inside
the temple

3 INT TEMPLE - DAY

Omar makes his way uneasily down a pillared corridor that opens
into a
vast room where an old scientist stands on a small wooden ladder in
front of
the wall across the room PROFESSOR MASSIMO PACOLI A young man is
beside
him BILLY MASTERSON age 25 an American student He has a large
sketchpad in
his hands Behind them AZIZ age 10 whose job is to hold the last
mirror which shines light into the expansive room
PROFESSOR
(deciphering)
when the three planets are in eclipse

His fingers trace across the wall which is covered with symbols

and
strange hieroglyphs as he deciphers

PROFESSOR
the black hole like a door is open
Evil comes sowing terror and chaos

See The snake Billy The Ultimate Evil
make sure you get the snake

The Professor points emphatically to the snake the symbol of

Evil
coming through the door between the three planets in eclipse CU
Billys hand sketches the snake quickly He is a natural artist

BILLY
And when is this door opening snake act
supposed to occur

The Professors fingers touch the signs

PROFESSOR
if this is the fiveand this the thousand

He calculates

PROFESSOR
Every five thousand years

BILLY
(kidding)
So I have some time

He reaches for the pad

ANGLE ON Omar Standing at the entrance to the chamber with

the water
bag entranced by the sight A skeletal hand falls on his shoulder

Omar
turns to an ancient PRIEST in a rough milled black cannock

PRIEST
I will take it to them my son

Startled but obedient Omar gives the water bag to the Priest

PRIEST
Go with God be safe from Evil
The Priest makes the sign of the Cross on the boys forehead
dismissing
him

As soon as he is gone the Priest turns a worried eye to the
Professor

ANGLE ON The Professor is back to translating Billy to
sketching

PROFESSOR
then arrange the elements of life against
the Terror just so

His fingers run on

PROFESSOR
Waterfireearthairfour
elements around the fifth

His fingers fall on the one element that has a human shape
surrounded by
all the others

The Priest opens the water skin and begins to pour a vial of
powder into

the skin

ANGLE ON Aziz falling asleep The mirror falls the light

fails
PROFESSOR
Aziz Light
The boy struggles to stay awake The mirror comes up
PRIEST
Lord forgive me they already know too
much
PROFESSOR
in which all the history of the Universe
resides
-all the strengthall the hopeProtect us from
Evil
PRIEST (VO)
Amen
The Professor turns to the Priest who is pouring water into a tin
cup

from the skin
PROFESSOR
Father it in the most extraordinary thing
the greatest find in historycan you imagine
the implications

PRIEST
Only too well here you must be
parched

He hands the cup to the Professor The Professor takes it has
it almost
to his lips when

PROFESSOR
I mean look it is like a battle plan

In his excitement he does not drink much to the Priests
chagrin

PROFESSOR
Here the Good Here the Evil

As the Priest looks up Aziz the mirror boy tips his mouth

under the
water skin drinking the leakage

PROFESSOR
Here

He points to the Five Elements

PROFESSOR
A weapon against evil Amazing I am
going to be famous

PRIEST
Then let us toast to your fame Here Billy

The Priest hands Billy a cup

PRIEST
Drink

PROFESSOR
To fame salud

The Professor raises the cup to drink and then

PROFESSOR
We cannot toast with water Billy
In my sack the Grappa
The Priest watches disconsolate as the Professor tosses away
his water
Billy finishes his cup before running off into the tunnel

4 EXT COLONNADE - DAY

A muffled SOUND grows steadily louder Outside a monstrous
linear shadow
disturbs the kids game and gradually darkens the temple entrance

5 INT TUNNEL - DAY

Billy is looking for the grappa in the Professors bag He comes
upon a
machine pistol When the muffled SOUND suddenly grabs his attention
He
leans toward the corridor and sees part of a spaceship appear Billy
is
paralyzed

6 INT TEMPLE ROOM - DAY
The Professor keeps reading over the inscription

PROFESSOR
this perfect person this perfect
being I do not understand this perfect

PROFESSOR
Where is that boy Billy

7 INT TUNNEL - DAY

Billy presses himself against the wall in the shadows
terrified but

sketching away like mad as large shadowed figures lumber past him
He
begins to blink feeling the effects of the Priests potion

8 INT TEMPLE ROOM - DAY
The Professor reads the wall

PROFESSOR
And this divine Light they talk
about what is Divine light

At that moment the reflection from Azizs mirror drops again
The light
fails
PROFESSOR
(without turning)
Aziz light

The room is flooded with light all of the sudden

PROFESSOR
Better this is the most unbelievable thing
I have ever seen

The Professor turns around and is stunned speechless to find
himself
face to face with two MONDOSHAWANS A dozen others fill the hall
manning
the source of the light large luminous globes Aziz is fast asleep

PROFESSOR
(uncomprehending)
Uh yes

The Professor is lifted up and carried off to the side by the
aliens
The KOMMANDER stops in front of the Priest who is still on his knees
face
to the ground

PRIEST
Master He was about to discover everything
but I had the situation under control

The two MONDOSHAWAN GUARDS hold the professor three feet off the
ground

PROFESSOR
(in a panic)
Who are you Are you Germans Sprechen
Sie Deutsch
9 INT TUNNEL
Billy staggers forward a machine pistol in his hand
10 INT TEMPLE ROOM

The KOMMANDER holds out his hand to the Priest

PRIEST
What did I do wrong

The Priest jumps to his feet excitedly

KOMMANDER
Servant you and the thousand guards

before you You have done your work well

but we have to recover the elements War will
soon engulf your planet We must keep them safe

The Kommander goes over to the wall and seems to be looking for a
lock
He finds it and slides in his metallic finger which is more intricate
than a key to a safe He turns his hand activating a mechanism that
opens
the wall

PROFESSOR
Unbelievable

The Kommander turns around and crooks a finger One of the
MONDOSHAWANS

waves his hand puts the professor to sleep and heads down the
hallway
revealed by the opening He is followed by his men The Priest slips
in
behind them

11 INT ROOM 2 TEMPLE - DAY

The Kommander steps into a vast room The ceiling is very high

pyramid-
shaped In each corner of the room four vessels contain four
rectangular twelve-inch stones- the four elements In the middle an

opaque sarcophagus rests on an altar The Kommander stops and
contemplates it a moment

PRIEST
(to himself)
The Fifth Element

KOMMANDER
Take them and put them in a safe place

His men carry out his order
12 INT ROOM 1 TEMPLE - DAY
Billy staggers across the floor struggling to stay awake
13 INT ROOM 2 TEMPLE - DAY
The Kommander opens a case His men come and put the four
precious

stones in it one by one

PRIEST
(moved)
Will the elements be gone now forever
from this place

KOMMANDER
When mankind comes to its senses
We will return

PRIEST
Knowing mankind as I do that could take
centuries
KOMMANDER

Time is of no importance only life
is important

The Priest nods and lowers his eyes

Angle on Billy staggering forward raising his pistol blinking
his
eyes to focus

A MONDOSHAWAN puts the fourth element in the case The Kommander
shuts the

case and looks at the Priest

KOMMANDER
When EVIL returns so shall we

PRIEST
(head lowered)
We will be ready Lord

Billy suddenly staggers into the room brandishing his gun

BILLY
Stop

Billy trips the gun goes off He empties the clip The
Mondoshawan

carrying the case crumples to the ground The wall immediately begins
to

close Billy fires wildly unable to control the powerful kicking
gun

PRIEST
No Dont

The Priest rushes Billy The weapon has such a kick to it that
Billy

starts shooting into the air backs up then stumbles and knocks
himself
out The Priest is on the ground seriously wounded So is the
Kommander
The WARRIORS are in a panic

CLERK
Hurry Kommander The walls closing

The wall continues to close Sand pours in from everywhere The
vast
room fills up like an hourglass

KOMMANDER
A mission is a mission Savoia
Youll learn that

The Kommander picks up the case and reaches the wall but cant
get
through it His

armor is too bulky the opening too small He manages to get his
arm and
the case through

KOMMANDER
My apologies to General Kroi -- and my wife

The wall closes crushing his arm The CLERK scoops up the case
and runs

through the huge piles of sand
14 EXT COLONNADE - DAY

The CLERK boards the ship carrying the case Omar hides ina
corner
frightened to death hugging Billys bag of drawings

CU of a digital control screen Three planets projecting three
straight
lines that crisscross at one point Identical to the one observed by

ships window at one of the three huge planets in eclipse

STAEDERT
Dont you have anything Not even

CAPTAIN
The thermo-analyzers have jammed
One of them reads over a million degrees

Never seen anything like it

In the middle of the shadows a door to the nightmare has just
opened

23 INT CONTROL ROOM PRESIDENTS OFFICE

CAPTAIN
President on line sir

General Staedert leans over his screen and seems surprised to see
the
room but not the president

PRESIDENT (0S)
Staedert do you read me

STAEDERT
I can hear you Mr President but I
cant see you

The President grabs the mini-camera on his desk and yanks it
around to
face him

His face fills the screen

PRESIDENT
(exasperated)
Is that better

STAEDERT
Perfect Mr President

PRESIDENT
I have to address the Supreme Council
in 10 minutes
Just the facts General
STAEDERT
There are no results from the chemical
and molecular analysis as of yet all the
calibers are overshotwere hoping a
thermo nucleatic imaging

PRESIDENT
(exasperated)
What you are saying is you dont know
what thisthingis

Consternation reigns in the Presidents office

STAEDERT
Not yet SirThe only thing we know is
it just keeps getting bigger

PRESIDENT
Options

STAEDERT
Wait or act

PRESIDENT
Recommendations

STAEDERT
My philosophy Mr President is shoot first
ask questions later
I dont like uninvited guests

PRESIDENT
Gentlemen

HEAD CHEMISTS
I think it would be foolish to shoot at an
organism that seems alive without first
taking the time to study it more
Besides it has shown no signs of hostility

PRESIDENT
(worried)
No its just getting bigger

HEAD CHEMISTS
So do people but thats no reason to shoot
them

PRESIDENT
(exasperated)
The security of the Federated Territories is
and remains number one priority
(to the military)
I suppose General Staederts philosophy is
acceptable to you

All the Generals nod yes

PRESIDENT
All right then Staedert

PRIEST (0S)
Mr President

The President scans the room Staedert remote controls the camera
toward
the room

PRESIDENT
Yes

The camera moves up the Priest and we finally discover his face
He is
in his sixties a shrewd look in his eyes

Around his neck hangs the Kommanders finger the key to the
temple

PRIEST
Cornelius Vito Cornelius 50th level parish
I have a different theory to offer you
Mr President

PRESIDENT
Im listening

CORNELIUS
Imagine for a moment that this thing is not
anything that can be identified because it

prefers
not to be because it is the antithesis of all we

are
Because it is evil TOTAL EVIL

PRESIDENT
(a little sarcastically)
One more reason to shoot first eh

All the Generals nod in agreement
CORNELIUS
Evil begets evil Mr President

Shooting would only make it stronger

24 INT SPACESHIP
TECHNICIAN
The probe will attain its objective in
five seconds

Staedert moves closer to the ships window

25 EXT SPACE

Evil swallows the probe and immediately bubbles over with
activity like a
furious volcano

26 INT PRESIDENTS OFFICE

STAEDERT
Mr President were at crisis point

The President looks puzzled

PRESIDENT
Your theory is interesting Father but
I dont think we have time to go into it
right now

CORNELIUS
Time is of no importance Mr President
Only life is important

PRESIDENT
(exasperated)
Thats exactly what we are going to try and do
Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our
fellow citizens General

A bead of sweat pearls Staederts forehead He is about to give
an order
when a gigantic flame emerges from the planet and literally swallows
Staederts spaceship

The Mondoshawans dont belong to the

in their possession are the four elements of

life

These elements when they are gathered around a
fifth

The Supreme Being ultimate warrior created to
protect

The SUPREME BEING is standing as if frozen in armor All we see
is the
bottom half of his body Big metallic gloves hold the case engraved
with
the emblem of the three suns containing the four Sacred Stones

CORNELIUS
-will produce what the ancients called the
light of creation the light of total goodness
which is the only thing that can defeat EVIL

The President points to the spot occupied by the 5th element

PRESIDENT
But what happens if instead of
this Ultimate Warrior it is EVIL

who stands here

CORNELIUS
White turns to black Light to Dark
Life to Death For all eternity

The Presidents nerves quiver

CAPTAIN
Sir we have a Mondoshawan spaceship at
the frontier requesting permission to enter
our territory
PRESIDENT
I guess I should make a decision

CORNELIUS
They are the only ones who can help

GENERAL
Sirthe Mondoshawan do not belong to the
federation We do not know their intention
I must recommend a full trinuclear assault

PROFESSOR MACTILBURGH age 60 hurries alongside GENERAL MUNRO

MUNRO
This is all that survived

MACTILBURGH
Actually only one cell survived

MUNRO
Have you identified it

MACTILBURGH
Its not that easyweve never encountered
anything like it beforeyou see normal human
beings have 40 DNA memo groumswhich is
more than enough for any species to perpetuate
itselfThis one has 200000

MUNRO
Talk English Doc

MACTILBURGH
This cell is like a huge library It has infinite
genetic knowledge stored inside
Almost like it wasengineered

MUNRO
Sounds like a freak of nature to me

MACTILBURGH
Yes I cant wait to meet him

They pass into the lab
INT LABORATORY

The two enter a cylindrical laboratory There is a huge glass

turbine in

the middle with the metal glove inside A DNA chain scrolls on the
computer

screen

MACTILBURGH
(rather fascinated)
The compositional elements of his DNA
chain are the same as ours there are simply
more of them tightly packed
His knowledge is probably limitless
MUNRO
(worried)
Is there any danger Some kind of virus

MACTILBURGH
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector
The cell is for lack of a better word perfect

Munro hesitates a moment Then he sighs and uses his personal
key to
open the

self-destruct box

MUNRO
OK go ahead But Mr Perfect better be polite
otherwise I turn him into cat food

Mactilburgh starts the operation rolling as Munro puts his hand
on the
sell-destruct button ready to use it Thousands of cells form in the
heart of the generator an assemblage of DNA elements Then the cells
move
down a tube like a fluid and gather in an imprint of a HUMAN body
Step
by step bones are reconstructed then the nervous and muscular
systems
Whole veins wrap around the muscles An entire body is reconstructing
before
our very eyes

DOCTOR
Three seconds to ultra-violet protection

A shield comes over the reconstructing body and makes it
invisible

MACTILBURGH
(to Munro)
This is the crucial phase The reconstruction
of pigment Cells are bombarded with slightly
greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells
to react to protect themselves
That means growing skin Clever eh

MUNRO
(disgusted)
Wonderful

The meter slows drops to zero

ASSISTANT
End of reconstruction beginning of
reanimation

A whoosh of air in the glass chamber Captain Munro has his hand
on the

An electrical discharge fills the glass chamber causing the body
inside
to jerk

After a few moments of silence the SOUND of a heartbeat fills
the room
over the loudspeaker

ASSISTANT
Life support system activated

The Supreme Being is alive once again

MACTILBURGH
Remove the shield

The ASSISTANT automatically removes the ultra-violet shield which
slowly
reveals a woman nude young and very beautiful Munro
stands there
gaping Not quite his vision of the Supreme Being Mactilburgh
glances

at Munro and gently pushes his hand away from the self-destruct
button

MACTILBURGH
(with a smile)
I told you perfect

Munro is hypnotized by the GIRLs beauty

MUNRO

-Id uh like to get a few pictures for the
archives

before she wakes up

Mactilburgh looks at him with a grin A remote-control camera
approaches
the girls face a flash goes off Blinded by the flash the girl
jumps and
screams She cowers in a corner shaking from the cold darting eyes
everywhere looking for the case she was holding

The girl kicks the window repeatedly

MACTILBURGH

Leeloo innocently sticks his finger in the jar then puts it in
her mouth

KORBEN
It melts in your mouth doesnt it

She savors the honey slowly sensually Her lips shine with
honey Her
eyes narrow with pleasure Korben is hypnotized by her lips like a
moth

attracted to a flame He begins to lose control which makes him
nervous

An indistinct sound comes from the wall But Korben is so
entranced with
the sight of Leeloo licking her honied fingers he doesnt hear it
until
it becomes quite a racket
