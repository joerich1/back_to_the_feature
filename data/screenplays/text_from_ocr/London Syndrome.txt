INT HEATHROW AIRPORT ARRIVALS DAY
Open on a BLACK screen

LEARN ENGLISH TAPE OS

(Queens English)
Welcome to Britain We hope you had
a pleasant journey Afternoon tea
will be served at 4 o’clock in the
garden room Might you be
interested in a walking tour of the
grounds If you need any further
assistance please don’t hesitate
to ask We hope you enjoy your
stay

The picture fades up to reveal a pair of eyes looking wide
eyed and excited

The Learn English examples continue to flow as we reveal the
head of a young attractive Japanese girl HARUKA 21

She wears an elegant Burberry raincoat with the rest of her
clothes mirroring a classic British look

We realise that the woman’s voice is coming from inside her
headphones As she removes them we’re hit with the white
noise of hustle and bustle

Haruka is standing in the middle of loud and bustling
Heathrow Airport

She begins to move - a tiny figure quickly swallowed up by
the crowds

INT HEATHROW EXPRESS DAY

Haruka is on the train into London her faux Burberry handbag
and suitcase beside her

Whilst still listening to her headphones she’s looking at a
scrapbook filled with cut out pictures of Wills and Kate
Harry Styles and Hugh Grant Turning the page we see images
of Downton Abbey and London’s classic architectural heritage

She closes it and holds it tight to her chest as she stares
out of the window at the ugly urban sprawl

Her eyes flit rapidly from side to side - unable to focus on
the passing landscape
EXT PADDINGTON TRAIN STATION DAY

Haruka is struggling to navigate her way through the station
Standing on the platform she attempts to ask if she’s at
Paddington but she’s too shy to speak up People carry on

oblivious

Looking at a sign she stops walking and turns suddenly in
the opposite direction

The person behind walks straight into her

WOMAN
Look where you’re going

Haruka stares at her shocked and utterly overwhelmed

EXT STATION STEPS DAY

She struggles to lift her heavy case up the station stairs
Again no one offers assistance She’s creating a pile up and
one person hurriedly brushing past causes her bag to slip
down a few steps

A hand suddenly reaches out and takes hold of the handle

It belongs to PETER 27 Attractive dressed in clean cut
classic Gap style clothing

He has an awkward manner a bit Hugh Grant with nervous
tendencies making his actions jerky but with a contagious
energy Clumsy yet charming he has a floppy fringe which we
would consider 90s’ boy band but to Haruka is perfection

With a friendly smile he takes her bag and carries it to the
top of the stairs

Haruka flushed nods in gratitude

HARUKA
Thank you

Peter gives Haruka a nod in return

PETER
My pleasure

Another beaming smile and then he disappears

INT TICKET MACHINE DAY

Haruka is now struggling to buy a travel pass from the
machine with a queue of impatient Londoners behind
Peter appears again by her side

PETER
The head faces upwards

He takes a proper look at her as she pays the machine A
pound short she hurriedly roots around in a traveller’s purse
which she wears as a slim bum bag under her jumper

Peter looks through his change and quickly inserts the final
amount

PETER (CONTD)
Not having the best day

Haruka shakes her head

HARUKA
Thank you

PETER
(jokingly)
Just off the boat

Haruka shakes her head

HARUKA
No plane

Peter smiles Haruka smiles back unaware of the
misunderstanding It’s his turn to top up his Oyster

PETER
First time

HARUKA
Yes City of dreams

Haruka takes her scrapbook from her backpack and turning to
the last page shows him an address

HARUKA (CONTD)
Can I ask - Slough please Which

bus

PETER
Hmmmm It’s closer to Heathrow than
London

Haruka looks confused

HARUKA
Hostel Greatest London

PETER
It’s not even Greater London
You’1l1 need to get a train
Pointing to her travel card

PETER (CONT’D)
That won’t get you there

Haruka looks disappointed

PETER (CONTD)
Ask at tourist information

Peter hesitates for a moment checking his watch

PETER (CONT’D)
Best of luck

He gives her a smile and walks off Haruka watches him as he
stops pauses and turns around and begins to walk back
towards her

PETER (CONTD)
Look I don’t know if this might be
of interest but there’s a place I
know that’s popular with
travellers My girlfriend lives

there
HARUKA
Girlfriend
PETER

Yes She’s French I’m sure you can
pay by the week It’s in East
London in a cool area Up and
coming arty

HARUKA
It’s name

PETER
The place Dalston

Haruka writes the name down in her book He watches over her
shoulder

PETER (CONT’D)
One L

Haruka makes the change

PETER (CONT’D)
Even if you don’t stay there
better to be in London You’1ll have
a lot more fun than in Slough Do
you want to have a look

Haruka hesitates
PETER (CONTD)
I can write down the address and
directions

Peter motions to the scrapbook

She looks at him for a moment then passes it to him He
begins to write

PETER (CONTD)

The 38 bus goes from over there
When you get to the flat ask for
Derek or Emilie I’11 let them know
to expect you

HARUKA
Thank you

Peter looks at his watch

PETER
Ive really got to dash

About to go he stops again

PETER (CONT’D)
Sorry one more thing I’m Peter

Peter nervously flicks his hair as he says his name
Haruka smiles

HARUKA
Haruka

PETER
If you do take the room I’m sure
well be seeing a lot more of each
other

She bows her thanks as Peter offers his hand He eagerly
copies her with his own rather clumsy action

PETER (CONT’D)
Bye then

HARUKA
Bye

She’s left holding her scrapbook looking after him

INT 38 BUS DAY

Haruka’s still smiling from her chance encounter looking out
at the views of West London
She passes Buckingham Palace and Marble Arch beaming out of
the window at the famous sights

CUT TO

Oxford Street A distressed Romanian woman cries out to the
passing crowds Everyone ignores her Haruka is oblivious

An elderly woman boards the bus and she offers her seat

OLD LADY
Only on for one stop sweetheart

She places her hand on Haruka and guides her back down again
to her seat The bus continues

CUT TO
Progressing eastwards the landscape becomes less glamorous

A man behind Haruka begins talking to himself Everyone
ignores him He makes a hissing sound through his teeth as he
talks

MAN
Shouldve killed that mother
fucker Disrespecting my blood like
that Who’d he think he is I’1l
teach him respect Kill his fucking
yappy dog too

Haruka timidly looks up to see the man’s reflection in the
glass He notices and pushes his face up close behind her
ear

CRAZY MAN
Isn’t that the way That fucker’s
got to be silenced right

Haruka is terrified She goes to stand but just then a large
man sits up tight against her his knees touching the seat in
front She shrinks against the window trying to move away
from any contact

CUT TO

EXT DALSTON JUNCTION STATION DAY

The bus departs revealing Haruka standing outside the station
with her bags looking exhausted and disheveled

She stops and shows a passerby her book He points her in the
direction of the market
EXT RIDLEY ROAD MARKET DAY
Haruka’s greeted by a bustling lively and ramshackled scene

All around her traders conversing in languages from all over
the world do business shouting out to one another as she
goes by

Make-shift stalls are set up in front of open shop windows
with wide varieties of products on offer There are foods
from Asia Africa the Caribbean and Mediterranean to the
latest ladies fashion and pirated DVDs There’s a stall
displaying a row of mannequin heads displaying a variety of
elaborately styled wigs

Colour’s everywhere Silk Saris and Salwar Kameezes to food
sellers arranging their pyramids of fresh fruit and
vegetables Butchers display the white fury lining of cow’s
stomachs alongside lines of pigs’ feet

An assortment of Hackney characters pass as she makes her way
down the road The vegetable sellers shout unintelligible
phrases a little old lady cigarette in mouth barges past
dragging her shopping trolley and trendy students head to the
art cafes

Haruka looks around wide-eyed

As she walks down the road she struggles to wheel her
suitcase through the filthy market

An elderly West African woman and a young child stand by the
doorway of a hair and nail salon She preaches to passers-by
as the child stands obediently holding her hand

RAMLA
Heaven exists not here not in your
dreams Atone for your sins or face
eternal damnation

Haruka is mesmerised by the chanting The woman stares
intently at her She quickly moves on down the street

CUT TO

She walks by numerous doors searching for the numbers - with
Many just blank She looks through the window of a workers’
cafe Builders and cabbies sit inside eating all day
breakfasts while others stand outside smoking making deals

The sudden presence of Haruka distracts them
BUILDER

(kindly)
What you after love
HARUKA
Number 58

The builder turns his head to look at the flat above
BUILDER
(shouting)
Derek

There’s no reply

BUILDER (CONTD)
Give that door a knock

HARUKA
Thank you

BUILDER
Pleasure treasure

The builder takes a good look at Haruka as do many of the
other men as she knocks on a tired looking door

She waits a moment She knocks again She can hear feet
thumping down stairs and disgruntled mumbling coming from
inside

DEREK OS
Alright I heard you the first time

The door is opened sharply by DEREK a local East Londoner
early 40s stocky- who knows how to handle himself

Upon seeing Haruka his eyes quickly scan up and down

DEREK
Peter’s friend

Haruka nods

DEREK (CONT’D)
Come up then

She steps inside

BUILDER TWO
Derek you dirty dog

BUILDER THREE
Got yourself a mail order bride

DEREK
Shut up and get back to work

The men laugh as the door closes
INT DEREKS HALLWAY DAY

As they walk up the stairs from the front door Derek stops
on the landing and motions for Haruka to go ahead

She is forced to squeeze past it’s impossible to keep her
body away from his She starts to move facing him then
changes her mind at the last minute deciding it preferable
to turn her back to face his front

He stands still pointing out the different rooms

DEREK
Kitchen bathroom two bedrooms my
office You rent the room - each
door has a lock You’1ll be sharing
with Emilie

Haruka peers through into the rooms

DEREK (CONTD)
Emilie

Derek doesn’t wait a second before pushing the door allowing
Haruka to peer through Two beds one messy the other
dressed with faded bedding sit between a desk a chair anda
wardrobe

DEREK (CONTD)
300 for the month You got it in
cash

HARUKA
Peter said 250

DEREK
Must have misheard

Haruka shakes her head adamantly and shows Derek her
scrapbook pointing to the written £250

DEREK (CONTD)
300 That’s the price

She hesitates

DEREK (CONT’D)
Got somewhere else to stay

She doesn’t answer

After a moment she hands Derek the money There aren’t many
notes left now in her purse alongside her passport

DEREK (CONTD)
Passport too

Haruka hesitates Derek is waiting hand out Then a voice
comes from behind

CATHY a plump Irish woman mid 30s dressed in UGG style
boots and a tracksuit stands watching Derek suspiciously

CATHY
A photocopy should do No Derek

DEREK
(disgruntled)
I keep my books in order

Cathy’s not budging

DEREK (CONT’D)
A decent copy then

He passes Haruka her key

DEREK (CONTD)
No personal heaters Hot water 7am
till 9am No baths

Said as he’s leaving

DEREK (CONTD)
And tell Emilie I’m looking for
her

Haruka is left alone with Cathy in the hallway

CATHY
You look done-in darlin I’1l put
the kettle on

Cathy motions towards the bedroom

CATHY (CONTD)
She’s in

HARUKA
Thank you I’m Haruka

CATHY
Cathy darlin’

Haruka takes off her shoes and places them outside the door
She opens her suitcase and removes a pair of delicate silk
slippers and steps into them

She gently knocks Entering she finds EMILIE 23 an
attractive French girl watching Derek from the window as he
leaves the flat

EMILIE
He makes my skin crawl

Haruka puts her bags down by the door Emilie points to the
opposite corner

EMILIE (CONTD)
That side

Haruka moves her bags again

Cathy enters holding a mug of weak milky tea with the tea bag
still in it

CATHY
I wasn’t sure how many sugars so I
just put two

Haruka looks down at the mug the rim decorated with stains
from previoua drinks Emilie too looks on in distaste

HARUKA
Thank you Cathy

Looking around the room she notices with discomfort that both
Cathy and Emilie are wearing their outside shoes inside the
room

CATHY
How long are you here for then

HARUKA
One month

Emilie applying her make up at her vanity table interrupts-

EMILIE
You will need to find a replacement
soon I hope to be moving out in a
couple of weeks

CATHY
(cattily)
Looks like you’1ll be working on
that tonight

Emilie and Cathy exchange withering looks
Cathy leaves the room

Haruka’s mesmerised by Emilie as she transforms herself
aware of Harukas gaze

HARUKA
Going with Peter

EMILIE
(sarcastically)
Why You want to come

HARUKA
(genuinely)
Yes Thank you

Emilie scoffs

Becoming suddenly very tired Haruka takes her pillow and
leans against the wall closing her eyes

CUT TO

INT HARUKA’S ROOM NIGHT

Haruka wakes with a jolt It’s pitch black She’s now lying
in an awkward sideways slump on the bed There’s a humming of
electricity and the pipes are banging The noise of sirens
and helicopters can be heard outside amongst the rumble of
the overground

She opens the door and looks out onto the landing All doors
are closed The flat is deserted and dark

She goes to put her shoes on when suddenly she hears the
front door open Crouched down through just a crack she
looks out She sees three pairs of men’s feet and legs come
up the stairs Derek at the front Each man carries a heavy
suitcase

Derek unlocks his office door and ushers them inside He’s
careful to lock the door and hide the key under a rug when
they leave now without the suitcases

Downstairs and outside they go

Haruka steps out and closes her bedroom door

She hears a scratching sound from behind the office door -
nails desperately scraping on wood

She quickly heads towards the front door

INT STAIRS NIGHT

Descending the stairs she notices drops of blood on the
carpet She bends down to take a closer look following the
trail which leads to the front door

At the door she realises that she’s forgotten her key She
pats down her pockets as she turns to go back up the stairs

Looking up the trail of blood from before is no longer
there

EXT DALSTON NIGHT

Haruka ventures onto the streets The market has now closed
and rotting fruit litters the pavement

She passes a shop with its window smashed and a sign swinging
from a shop front advertising African specialist hair
products

EXT BRICK LANE NIGHT

The clubs are pumping and the neon lights of the curry houses
flash in different colours as Haruka navigates her way
through the crowded streets Walls are covered in brightly
coloured graffiti and there’s a real vibe to the people who
are out and about

She is enthralled by the life surrounding her - staring
through the windows of the delicatessens and bakeries selling
Turkish delights and South Asian delicacies

The bagel shops have rows of bread and illuminated glass
boxes full of warm pinky red salt beef in their windows

Indian waiters enthusiastically try to tempt her into their
restaurants but she politely refuses

She stops for a moment to view a couple kissing She watches
them longingly

The woman spots her pulling away to point Haruka out to her
boyfriend

Haruka hurriedly moves on down the street

EXT WHITECHAPEL STREET NIGHT
Turning the corner she sees a young girl bent double crying

As she moves closer we see beer cans surrounding the girl
and a friend beside her who begins rubbing her back when she
spots Haruka

The pair can’t be more than 13 but are made-up to look a lot
older Both have scraped back gelled blonde hair and are
wearing skimpy outfits They could almost be identical twins

Haruka stares concerned
GIRL
She’s diabetic Needs sugar All
our stuff was stolen Money
phones

She removes a sweet from her bag and offers it

GIRL (CONT’D)
(pleading)
We need money to get her home

Haruka’s frozen The girl is waiting Her tone becomes slow
deliberate and forceful as she inflects every word-

GIRL (CONTD)
I said we need money

Becoming more aggressive the girl steps closer

GIRL (CONTD)
Did you hear me

The girl takes another step closer forcing Haruka back
against the wall until their faces almost touch

GIRL (CONT’D)
Now

Haruka begins to fumble in her bum bag under her jumper She
pulls out a ten pound note The girl immediately snatches it

Haruka’s left speechless She opens her mouth as if to
retaliate

GIRL (CONTD)
What What’s a tenner to you

The girl waves it in front of her but Haruka is too slow
GIRL (CONT’D)

Don’t want her being ill on your

conscience
The girls run off shrieking with laughter
Haruka presses her back against the wall hand holding onto a
window sill Her breathing gets faster as her heartbeat
becomes louder Despite the cool night she begins to sweat
MINI BLACK-OUT
She turns facing the glass to steady herself She
momentarily sees her reflection before her focus shifts and
it appears that she is inside the house behind the curtains

looking out at herself

The illusion is broken when suddenly a hand knocks
aggressively from behind the window telling her to move on

Unsteady on her feet she heads off again

EXT STREETS OF WHITECHAPEL NIGHT

She finds herself in Jack the Ripper territory of Gunthorpe
and Osbourne Street becoming increasingly lost and confused

Taking out her smart phone and scrapbook her hands shake as
she enters the address Peter wrote down Just as the phone
begins to search - the battery dies

Rushing along the narrow Edwardian streets she becomes
confused All the houses share a uniform facade making every
road appear the same

She hears the sound of unnatural high pitched laughter coming
from one of the windows A door further up the street shuts
with a bang with no indication of which door has closed The
laughter stops

Haruka hurries on Then relief - turning a corner she sees a
busier street ahead

EXT STREETS OF WHITECHAPPEL NIGHT

Turning onto the street she’s caught in a tunnel of boozed
up men in their late 20s Their leering faces loom in front
of Haruka’s grotesque and intimidating

MAN ONE
Alright Where you headed then

Haruka tries to move away from them but they block her path
MAN TWO
Don’t scurry off You frightened
her you twat

A couple of the men start to circle Haruka

MAN ONE
She’s just playing hard to get

MAN THREE
Youd snap her in half

MAN ONE
Id have a go

MAN THREE
Bit of Asian persuasion Dave

Haruka tries to escape their tunnel

MAN TWO
You trying to do one love

Haruka makes a dash for it

MAN TWO (CONTD)
(shouting in her face)
Go on then RUN

CUT TO

EXT STREET NIGHT

Haruka is distressed and confused still running Her
heartbeat is in our ears rising along with her panic

The picture fades in and out of black She clings to the
scrapbook with the address Peter wrote in the back

EXT A STREET OF BARS AND CLUBS NIGHT

Outside a club men are hustling their illegal minicab
services

Each encourages Haruka to take their car in a line of ones
ready to go They talk at her in a collection of different
accents

One is particularly persistent stepping forward the MINICAB
DRIVER is West African and in his early 40s

MINICAB DRIVER
Come You need a lift I’1l do you
a good price Where do you want to
go

CAB DRIVER ONE
This car ready Let’s go

CAB DRIVER TWO
What’s his price I’1ll do
cheaper

CAB DRIVER ONE
Come on Let’s go Car ready

The Minicab Driver moves closer Haruka hesitates

MINICAB DRIVER
Ill take you home

He notices the piece of paper in Haruka’s hand He takes it
from her - their hands briefly touch He reads

MINICAB DRIVER (CONT’D)
Come it’s close I know Derek
I’1l do it for ten pounds

The drivers hustle her towards different cars The Minicab
Driver is the main one moving her physically to get into the
back of his blue Ford Escort

Haruka is trying to tell him no and resisting but he’s
forceful

The door is slammed The car sets off

INT MINICAB NIGHT

As they begin to travel along the road Haruka becomes
increasingly anxious and uncomfortable

She can only see the drivers eyes and forehead in the rear-
view mirror He’s looking intently ahead at the road

HARUKA
Excuse me

He doesn’t respond

HARUKA (CONTD)
Excuse me Sir

In the rear-view mirror the driver’s eyes flit upwards to
momentarily look at Haruka before looking back at the road

HARUKA (CONT’D)
Please I want to get out Now

He ignores her and continues driving She becomes
increasingly panicked

HARUKA (CONT’D)
Let me out

She tries to open the door while the car is in motion

The driver turns to look over his shoulder shouting at her
furious

In her panic Haruka’s hearing has become muffled Her
heartbeat dominates all sound

The driver is now leaning over his arm outstretched trying
to grab at her She fights back attempting to protect
herself The car door suddenly swings open

BLACK-OUT

CUT TO

EXT STREET NIGHT

Black screen Sounds of distant traffic and sirens start to
filter in

We see Haruka lying on the ground

A black hand is knocking repeatedly on Derek’s flat door
A light comes on inside

Whoever knocked disappears

Cathy appears in a fluorescent pink dressing gown

CATHY
Jesus Christ

CUT TO

INT HARUKA’S BEDROOM NIGHT

Haruka is lying on her bed wearing Cathy’s dressing gown
Emilie’s still out

Cathy enters and passes Haruka a cup of tea She takes a
small bottle of whiskey from her pocket and adds a shot to
the mug

She gestures that Haruka must drink it all With a grimace
she does as she’s told

CATHY
Youve had a lucky escape darlin’
There’s some horrid bastards out
there
Haruka tries to raise herself but Cathy holds her firmly

HARUKA
I need to speak to my parents

Cathy nods

CATHY
Ill get my laptop

CUT TO

INT HARUKA’S BEDROOM NIGHT

Haruka holds the computer on her knee in bed She’s about to
press call when she becomes upset again Pausing for a moment
she tries to regain her composure

She notices a flower on the floor by the end of Emilie’s bed
She leans over to pick it up Attached is a small note that
reads

‘Peter x’

She quickly tucks it under her pillow

She hits call

Skype connects and the image of Haruka’s parents appears on
screen They look elderly and worried sitting in their
simple house

The conversation is spoken in Japanese with English
subtitles

HARUKA
Hello

It takes a moment to connect

HARUKA (CONTD)
Mum Dad -

Suddenly their faces change as Haruka’s image and sound
appears They anxiously scan the screen

DAD
Yes Hello Thank goodness Was the
flight delayed What happened Have
you arrived in Slough

Haruka hesitates for a moment

MUM
Haruka

HARUKA
Yes I’m here

MUM
We’ve been so worried

HARUKA
I’m fine

MUM
You look tired Have you been
crying

HARUKA
I just need some sleep Is that
Grandma

Haruka has spotted a figure to the side of the screen
wrinkled with long grey hair

Dad moves the camera towards her Grandma pushes her face
closer to the screen with intense interest

GRANDMA
Have you seen the palace Was the
flag flying Was Queen Elizabeth at
home

Dad dismissing Grandma moves the camera back to him and
Mum

DAD
What is London like

MUM
Are you warm enough Have you
eaten Have you met nice people

Haruka is on the verge of tears

HARUKA
I have to go now I need to sleep

MUM
So soon We’ve only just seen your
face

DAD

She’s exhausted Ok darling We
love you Let’s speak tomorrow

HARUKA
Bye

MUM DAD GRANDMA
Bye Be safe We love you

Haruka hovers over the hang up button Her parent’s faces
full of concern have frozen for a moment

HARUKA
Bye - Bye

She hits hang up

She sits in bed with her head down resting on her arms She
begins to sob uncontrollably

INT BEDROOM MORNING

Haruka is woken by Emilie’s voice She pops her head around
the bedroom door

EMILIE
Haruka - wake up The police are
here

She disappears again

Haruka opens her eyes slowly coming to

INT KITCHEN DAY

Haruka’s sat at the kitchen table with Cathy holding her
hand Emilie is beside them with a female police officer

Cathy’s milky tea sits in front of everyone except Emilie who
drinks black coffee

POLICE WOMAN
So you can’t remember anything
about the driver his car or the
attack

Haruka shakes her head Emilie rolls her eyes
The police woman takes a deep breath
POLICE WOMAN (CONTD)
(frustrated)
It’s going to be very difficult for
us with so little information
After a moment’s thought-
HARUKA
(expectantly)
He knew Derek
She stops and looks at Haruka
POLICE WOMAN
(dryly)

Everyone knows Derek

CUT TO

INT HALLWAY DAY
Derek is waiting outside the toilet

The door opens and Haruka steps out to almost jump back in
again in shock

DEREK
Enough storytelling about the
drivers I don’t want the police
round here again Understand

Haruka is too scared to respond

DEREK (CONT’D)
Or youll be out on the street

Derek walks off slamming his office door

INT KITCHEN DAY

Haruka is sat at the kitchen table A romantic slightly
melancholic song plays on the radio

In front of her the scrapbook sits to one side and a small
wooden box with an elastic band fastening it She opens it to
reveal various cooking ingredients from home dried ginger
wasabi paste green tea

She takes out a lump of katsuobushi (dried hard tuna fish)
She carefully and proficiently peels the first layer of flesh
with a knife

She then uses a cheese grater to remove the meat she wants to
add to her cooking She’s making miso soup using packets of
dried ingredients from home

A cup of Cathy’s tea sits in front of her Looking down she
notices a clump of what looks to be animal hair floating
beside the tea bag

Taking a spoon she gently nudges the hair to one corner
before removing it She holds the spoon in front looking at
the hair but is interrupted when a phone on the table begins
to ring The name reads “Tom”

Wet from the shower Emilie hurries to snatch it from the
table moving into the hall As she answers and begins to
talk flirtatious giggles can be heard

The doorbell rings and Cathy goes to answer it

Haruka listens in turning down the radio-

EMILIE
I think it will be you who’s saying
that Oui Oui I’1l see you
tonight at the canal by the
Towpath Cafe Yes At eleven
Au revoir

Peter then passes the door Haruka watches as he goes to
Emilie and kisses the back of her neck She jumps and shrugs
him off

PETER
Who was that

EMILIE
I’m about to get dressed

PETER
Who was it I’m curious

EMILIE
Someone about a job Can I have a
kiss
Emilie offers Peter her cheek

He kisses it before looking up and spotting Haruka

PETER
Ah Haruka You made it

He nervously flicks his hair as he walks towards her in the
kitchen

HARUKA
Hello Peter

PETER
How’s everything going

Emilie enters

EMILIE
Didn’t you hear

She waits for a moment- enjoying the moment

EMILIE (CONTD)
She was assaulted last night

PETER
No Who by

EMILIE
A cabbie who didn’t steal her money
and then dropped her home

PETER
What happened

Haruka is about to speak but Emilie beats her to it
EMILIE
She met London’s most considerate
attacker
Peter is annoyed by Emilie’s flippancy
EMILIE (CONTD)
Don’t worry Cathy’s playing
bouncer now I’m surprised you got
past the door

She turns to leave

EMILIE (CONTD)
I’1l be two minutes

She exits the room

PETER
Are you alright

HARUKA
Yes Cathy says very lucky I was
lost and thought he ok

PETER
It can happen to local girls the
same You’re not from Tokyo

HARUKA
No

PETER
The country

HARUKA
Japan

Peter smiles

PETER
The countryside

HARUKA
Oh

Haruka laughs realising her mistake

HARUKA (CONT’D)
Yes

They both laugh

Emilie enters the room now dressed and ready to go She’s
instantly jealous and suddenly affectionate towards Peter
placing her arm around him

EMILIE
What’s the joke

PETER
Just a little misunderstanding

EMILIE
Which was

PETER
Not so funny out of the moment

EMILIE

(snappy)
Ok Let’s go

PETER
Your hair’s wet

EMILIE
(firmly)
Ill wear a hat

Peter jumps to his feet

Emilie watches Haruka staring at Peter He searches in his
bag and pulls out a rather tatty A-Z

PETER
Here borrow this Then you’re less
likely to get lost

Haruka nods her head in a slight bow

HARUKA
Thank you

EMILIE
And don’t forget to lock the room

As Peter and Emilie walk outside Haruka hears

EMILIE (CONT’D) OS
Get off I’m not holding your hand
like I’m your mother

Haruka opens her scrapbook flicking through the pages of
princes and stops on a two-page spread of the different
sights from famous Brit Flick movies

EXT RIDLEY ROAD MARKET DAY

Haruka timidly walks down the market heading for the
overground A-Z firmly in her hand She’s cautious and
clearly nervous

Unseen by her a blue Ford Escort driven by her attacker
slowly passes as she ducks into Dalston station

INT PORTOBELLO MARKET DAY

She wanders through the impressive streets of West London to
Portobello Market In contrast to Ridley Road this market
sells antiques second-hand books paintings and vintage
clothing

The houses that frame the street are large white-brick
mansions with doors painted an array of classic colours In
her scrapbook she has the picture of the door from the film
Notting Hill She heads down the street in search of it

EXT WEST LONDON STREET DAY

She walks past a church as the bride and groom are being
photographed

Pieces of confetti are blown through the air She catches

EXT OUTSIDE HOTEL LATE AFTERNOON

Haruka’s outside drinking a cup of coffee from a street
vendor to keep warm

Cars pull up delivering guests for the evening

A celebrity arrives Camera bulbs flash as the press surround
the car and the back of a glamorous woman in an evening gown

is glimpsed

Haruka steps forward trying to catch sight of who it might be
but she disappears before she is able

EXT RIDLEY ROAD EARLY EVENING

As Haruka walks back she becomes nervous again her pace
visibly slower and more hesitant

She spots the police woman and another officer questioning a
young black cab driver from the cafe

As she’s nearing the flat she sees Derek chatting with the
other drivers in the cafe below

She hesitates to go closer watching from the shadows

Derek’s deep in conversation with a man who looks familiar
It could be her attacker - the Minicab Driver

Derek hands him a folded bunch of twenty pound notes which he
quickly counts before leaving not revealing all of his face

Derek now approaches Emilie who stands dressed to go out
flirting with one of the drivers

She spots him and begins to back away her body language

tense He reaches over and grabs her arm She gives him a
frightened look and tries to pull away but his grip’s too
tight

He says something to her prompting a disgusted expression
Determinedly she pulls her arm free He tries to grab her
again but she rushes out of the cafe

DEREK
Emilie

She disappears into the night leaving Derek furious

INT KITCHEN NIGHT

Haruka tumbles into the kitchen after running up the stairs

She looks to Cathy confused

CATHY (CONTD)
There’s gossip on the market
People can get hurt

She remains upset

CATHY (CONTD)
Come sit here and calm down

Cathy taps the seat and then puts the kettle on

CATHY (CONTD)
Where’ve you been all afternoon In
search of Prince Charming

Haruka goes silent Cathy continues to chop up the meat

CATHY (CONTD)
(almost to herself)
Take it from me darlin’ there ain’t
no such fella like that round here

Haruka sits at the table and watches Cathy preparing the
meat

HARUKA
I stay with you tonight

CATHY
Of course darlin’ We can watch one
of your floppy haired hero films

There’s a knock at the door Cathy leaves to answer it
CATHY (CONTD) OS

dinner

Haruka stares at the meat in the bag- it looks revolting

double takes when it appears to twitch

She then hears Peter’s voice downstairs She jumps up

The sound of a kerfuffle and then Peter bounding up the
stairs

CATHY OS (CONT’D)

Haruka sees Peter fling open the bedroom door
He then strides towards the kitchen

He’s embarrassed when he spots Haruka She notices that he’s
carrying paracetamol grapes and juice

PETER
(embarrassed)
Sorry
HARUKA

It’s alright

PETER
I didn’t mean to give you a shock

Haruka shakes her head Cathy walks in

CATHY
Youre making a fool of yourself

Peter gives her a withering look

She continues preparing the meal

Haruka watches Peter as he places the medicine and fruit on
the side He’s embarrassed
PETER
Can I leave this for Emilie She’s
not feeling well

Haruka nods

HARUKA
So kind

PETER
Do you know where she is

Haruka shakes her head
PETER (CONT’D)
Well hopefully she’s feeling better

Cathy snorts laughter

Awkward pause

vegetables

She dashes out into the hallway-

INT RESTAURANT KINGSLAND ROAD NIGHT

Haruka and Peter are sat in the window of a busy Vietnamese
restaurant on Kingsland Road

Inside the windows are steamed up They chat and laugh
clearly enjoying one another’s company Occasionally he
flicks his fringe from his eyes Haruka smiles as he does
this her cheeks rosy skin glowing and eyes alive

She begins to giggle as she teaches him how to hold
chopsticks Their hands momentarily entwine

crossed

CUT TO

INT HARUKA’S BEDROOM NIGHT
Haruka is sat on her bed again

Muffled shouting can be heard outside as Peter and Emilie
argue

Haruka’s writing a text message in Japanese

EVERYTHING GOING VERY WELL I WENT OUT TONIGHT WITH A NEW
FRIEND WHO IS CHARMING AND POLITE I AM VERY HAPPY TELL
GRANDMA LONDON IS A CITY OF DREAMS XxX

Send MUM and DAD

Haruka places the phone down and picks up a knitting needle
and wool

The sound of the downstairs door slamming She continues
knitting

Emilie enters the room it’s clear she’s had a few drinks

HARUKA
Hello Emilie

EMILIE
(cooly)
Hi

Emilie stands at her desk pretending to tidy her things

EMILIE (CONTD)
(casually)
Peter thinks that I’m the one who’s
been out for dinner with someone
else

She takes her perfume and dabs it onto her wrists and neck
still staring at Haruka

EMILE
He’s so besotted with me

Haruka ignores Emilie’s stare directed through the mirror
and continues knitting

EMILIE
But sometimes his eagerness can be

mistaken by those with more
childish fantasies

Emilie picks up Haruka’s scrapbook
EMILIE (CONTD)

But then Peter would hardly fit

into your little book would he

She scoffs opening it on a photo of Wills and Kate Taking a
pen she begins to doodle vulgar penises over Will’s face

Haruka is desperate to stop her but she remains seated on the
bed

EMILIE (CONTD)
Now it’s Peter

Emilie throws it down and Haruka immediately snatches it up
Peter arrives lingering at the door Haruka turns away
EMILIE (CONTD)
I thought you never wanted to see
me again
He doesn’t reply

EMILIE (CONTD)
Surprise surprise

PETER
Can we talk Outside

Emilie doesn’t move

PETER (CONTD)
Emilie please

EMILIE
I need a cigarette

Peter eagerly leaves for the front door
Just before she leaves Emilie looks at Haruka

EMILIE (CONTD)
English men are all wet flannels
but Peter is particularly soggy

Haruka looks at her confused
Emilie laughs and leaves the room

Haruka goes to stand at the window pulling back the
discolored curtains and opening it just a crack so she can
hear Emilie and Peter emerge below

PETER
I was near-by I thought some
medicine might

EMILIE
- Stalker

PETER
Emilie be reasonable

Peter is getting more distressed He tries to hold Emilie’s
arms

EMILIE
Get off You’re hurting me

Peter doesn’t loosen his grip
PETER
Youre my girlfriend I just wanted

to

Emilie laughs and pushes him off her She begins to walk
away

Peter loses it and punches the wall
PETER (CONTD)
(furious)
You make me feel so fucking small
I should just tell you to fuck
off
Peter is waiting for a reaction Emilie turns the corner

PETER (CONTD)
Emilie

He follows her

Haruka withdraws from the window to her bed where she
attempts to carefully peel off the defaced picture of Wills
from her scrapbook

DREAM SEQUENCE

INT HALLWAY NIGHT
It’s dark Noises of creaking wood and footsteps

We see men’s legs stepping up and down the stairs passing
one another with their bulging suitcases

Amongst them appears Haruka’s dainty shoes She’s trapped in
line following the feet shuffling in front of her She’s also
carrying a large case

She lets go and it tumbles back down the stairs The men
aren’t deterred from their climb- they keep going- pushing
her on

Reaching the top bags are being thrown into Derek’s office
When Haruka arrives two hefty men throw her inside and lock
the door

She tries desperately to open it The room is dark and she
hears something move from the corner Turning the two girls
from Brick Lane watch her closely without making a sound

She turns back to the door and continues to frantically beat
at it The scratching sound intensifies

As she bangs the door it morphs into that of the minicab She
throws all of her weight against it The Minicab Driver sits
in the front shrouded in the shadows of the car

He lunges forward attacking her Ripping at her clothes he
scratches her arms and chest The sound of nails scratching
from Derek’s office returns

Someone begins tapping on the window Haruka continues
desperately to try and open it The driver’s becoming more
violent

The door opens a fraction before closing on her fingers
crushing them She frantically pushes against it

Suddenly the door is opened by Peter who scoops her up into
his arms
INT RIDLEY ROAD MARKET NIGHT

The street is deserted- it’s just the two of them in the
moonlight Peter carrying Haruka

INT HARUKA’S BEDROOM NIGHT

He lays her on her bed We notice Haruka’s grandmother
sitting at the table brushing her long grey hair She
watches on smiling from the mirror

Haruka turns to Peter and whispers something in his ear We
then see that she’s whispering into her own ear A finger is
placed onto her lip to silence her

It belongs to Peter with just the one Haruka now remaining
He brushes his finger down the side of her face He then
takes her hand and places the white flower he gave to Emilie
in her palm It’s now dried and the petals flake away

Peter moves closer towards Haruka to kiss her For a split
second his face turns into that of the Driver with a tense
scared expression before returning to Peter again

INT HARUKA’S ROOM MORNING

Cathy wakes Haruka vigorously She’s clearly panicked

CATHY
Haruka

Haruka’s in a very deep sleep
CATHY (CONTD)
Haruka Did Emilie come back last
night Have you seen her this

She sleepily shakes her head

HARUKA
No Why

Cathy leaves the room in a panic mumbling under her breath

HARUKA (CONTD)
Why Cathy

Haruka quickly gets out of bed

EXT HACKNEY CANAL DAY

Cathy and Haruka are standing watching as a police tent is
set up next to the canal

Cathy takes Haruka’s hand and pushes her way through

INT TENT DAY

Entering the tent Haruka’s face loses all colour as she
stares horrified She sees the body of Emilie bloated from
the water with her mouth open her clothes being cut away
and placed in evidence bags Her fingers are badly bruised

Haruka puts a hand to her mouth in upset She looks like she
might be sick

DI TONY HUTCHINSON appears by their side

HUTCHINSON
Can you identify her
CATHY
Yes She’s Emilie Mandin We live

together

Hutchinson nods before leading them back outside

EXT HACKNEY CANAL DAY
The three stand by the water

HUTCHINSON
Any idea who could have done this

CATHY
No She knew a lot of people

HUTCHINSON

I’1l need to take down your
details Full name and address

As Cathy tells the DI Haruka is distracted Amongst the
crowds of people watching on from the bridge she’s spotted
the taxi driver

The man sees her and his face becomes tense and scared - a
familiar image from her dream He then disappears into the
crowd

HARUKA
Cathy that was him

Haruka points they look together with Hutchinson taking an
interest but he’s vanished

INT BATHROOM DAY

Haruka is sat on the toilet with the lid down

She’s visibly shaken with puffy eyes

She gets up to dampen her face It’s a sink with separate hot
and cold taps She’s struggling not to get scolded by the hot
water

To dry her face there’s only a greyish looking hand towel
She uses toilet roll instead gently dabbing away the wet

Looking at herself in the mirror she looks shattered

The water isn’t draining as it should instead foamy residue
is hovering above the plug hole

Reaching down she pushes her fingers through the water After
a moment she hits a blockage She slowly pulls out a large
clump of matted hair with flecks of skin still attached
Horrified she throws it into the toilet

She hears raised voices coming from the kitchen next door

Putting her ear closer to the wall she strains to listen

INT HALLWAY DAY

She tiptoes into the hallway DI Hutchinson and his partner
GEORGE are sat at the kitchen table interviewing Derek

GEORGE
No contract no record of her ever
having paid rent What’s going on

DEREK
She paid cash

GEORGE
With no large withdrawals from her
account And no employment How
could she have been paying her
rent

DEREK
No idea It wasn’t my problem

HUTCHINSON OS
Stop wasting our time We know you
were sleeping with her

DEREK
Prove it
Pause
GEORGE
Got the same plans for the Japanese
girl

Haruka looks terrified and confused She hurries back to her
room

INT HARUKA’S BEDROOM DAY

Haruka enters and sits on her bed Cathy is on the desk chair
and Peter looks out over the market

After a moment Derek can be heard going downstairs and then
the slam of the front door

Hutchinson now enters

HUTCHINSON

Peter turns and we see he’s upset He leaves the room with
Hutchinson

Cathy and Haruka are left alone Haruka starts to cry
HARUKA
Cathy I know it was driver I saw

him with Emilie last night

CATHY
So was Peter

HARUKA
Not lucky escape I’m frightened
What if he comes back for me

Cathy moves over to sit with Haruka on the bed to give her a
cuddle

CATHY
I’1l1 not let that happen

She brushes Haruka’s hair from her tear filled eyes

HARUKA
Poor Emilie

She looks to Cathy

HARUKA (CONTD)
Maybe I go home

Pause

CATHY
Youve told the police everything

Haruka nods

CATHY (CONTD)
Well let’s wait and see what
happens then They’1ll be having a
field day going through all Derek’s
affairs

Haruka doesn’t seem convinced

CATHY (CONTD)
I’1l not let anyone hurt you

She cuddles up closer to Cathy

HARUKA
Thank you Cathy

The two sit in silence waiting

Time passes Cathy’s fallen asleep on Haruka’s shoulder as
she stares ahead deep in thought her knitting on her lap

An agitated Peter walks back into the room Hutchinson
follows behind

He walks up to Cathy shaking her awake

HUTCHINSON
Come on Your turn

Cathy stirs Hutchinson’s already left the room She follows

Peter returns to the window visibly upset he’s pale and
completely grief stricken

HARUKA
(gently)
Peter

He walks over to Emilie’s vanity table running his fingers
over her things He picks up her perfume bottle and inhales

He sits deflated on the bed

PETER
That stupid argument
I behaved like such a shit It was
all in the heat of the moment

Peter looks to Haruka We see he’s close to tears

PETER (CONTD)
I shouldn’t feel so sad Did you
know she slept with half the
market No wonder she was ill so
often

He becomes more distressed Haruka goes to him placing a
hand on his shoulder He begins to cry She holds him
savouring every moment

Peter looks up to Haruka and almost whispers-

PETER (CONTD)
They think it was me

HARUKA
No no
Peter continues sobbing as Haruka holds him
PETER
You didn’t tell them did you
About the argument

Haruka shakes her head

INT HALLWAY DAY

She wanders back to her room where Cathy stands holding up a
DVD

CUT TO

INT HARUKA’S BEDROOM NIGHT

Haruka and Cathy are sitting on her bed slippered feet
hanging over the edge watching a film on Haruka’s laptop

Cathy wears her pink fluffy dressing gown Haruka wrapped in
her duvet

The sweeping sound track suggests romance on a Richard Curtis
scale We don’t see the film only their expressions Haruka
is mesmerised while Cathy rolls a cigarette lights it and
watches with some indifference- her enthusiasm from before
has vanished

INT HARUKA’S BEDROOM MORNING

Haruka is lying on the bed cutting out pictures from OK

Cathy refuses to answer again Haruka comes down the stairs
Peter asks her-

Haruka nods He squeezes past Cathy

PETER (CONTD)
Be two ticks

Haruka and Cathy are left alone
CATHY
Where’s this friendship suddenly
sprung from
Haruka shrugs
CATHY (CONTD)
I don’t like you spending so much

time with him

Haruka ignores her There’s an awkward silence

CATHY (CONTD)
Well call me if you need anything

Haruka nods

HARUKA
Thank you

An awkward silence again until Peter returns and the two set
off

looking radiant She’s searching in her bag for a hair comb
She begins to brush and Peter quickly takes a photo of her on
his phone

PETER
And this

Peter makes a gesture towards her scrapbook wanting to hold
it Haruka nods

He flicks through absorbing the collages of classic England

PETER (CONTD)
Quite the anglophile

Haruka looks confused

HARUKA
Special way to live

She takes the scrapbook from Peter and continues to flick
through as he watches her closely She looks particularly
beautiful as she loses herself in her fantasy

Taking a small flower from her pocket she presses it in the
back of her book

PETER
Youre a little magpie collecting
treasures for your little book

HARUKA
Special memory

Peter smiles proudly flicking his hair from his eyes

PETER
Welcome to my neighbourhood

Peter jumps up

PETER
Your wish is my command

EXT COUNCIL FLATS BY COLUMBIA ROAD DAY

skyscraper of a council block

He notices her disappointment

PETER
(jokingly)
It’s only temporary While they’re
doing up my West London flat

HARUKA
(honestly)
Notting Hill

He nods Getting a bit carried away with the joke

PETER
Yea My ‘London pad’ But I much

Haruka is absorbing all of this nodding eagerly Peter
begins to walk on keen to leave the estate behind

EXT HARUKA’S FLAT NIGHT

becomes a little awkward as she keeps waving so Peter isn’t
too sure when he should stop and walk away A couple of times
he turns to go but stops himself to continue the waving He
finally leaves

INT HARUKA’S BEDROOM NIGHT

Haruka turns on the light and immediately notices that her
underwear draw is open and has been disturbed Her knickers
which like everything else are usually ordered and folded in
a row have been rifled through

She frantically begins looking for something throwing
everything to the floor in her panic

She opens her faux Burberry passport holder

It’s empty

INT HALLWAY NIGHT

She runs to Cathy’s room and knocks on her door There’s no
response She looks to Derek’s office door

INT HALL NIGHT

Haruka finds the key she saw Derek hide under the rug and
enters

INT DEREKS OFFICE NIGHT

Stepping inside she’s greeted with a wall of suitcases each
with a hefty padlock bolting the zips

An old pull-out bed is in the corner with crumpled brownish
sheets

The floor is peppered with spots of dried blood One still
wet smears her silk slipper as she walks by

She goes to look through Derek’s drawers Everything is
locked

She hears the frantic sound of nails scratching against
material coming from a suitcase in the corner

Haruka moves towards it in great trepidation As she edges
closer the noise stops

A sack with something alive inside suddenly falls to the
floor and makes its way towards her A trail of blood leaks
through the material onto the floor

A terrified Haruka flees from the room

INT HARUKA’S BEDROOM NIGHT

She picks up her phone and dials Peter’s number

HARUKA
(hysterical)
Peter Need you

CUT TO

INT HALLWAY NIGHT

Haruka opens the door and throws herself into Peter’s arms
He holds her in a tight embrace

INT HARUKA’S BEDROOM NIGHT

Peter enters with a plate of thick white toast spread with
Margarine He passes it to Haruka who’s wrapped in her duvet
sitting up in bed

She takes the plate and looks at the toast but doesn’t touch
it

PETER
Have a bite

He tears off a small corner and nudges it to her side of the
plate She takes the tiniest of bites

He begins to stroke her face like he did in her dream

PETER (CONT’D)
Everything will be ok I’m here
Youre safe

It becomes more intimate Peter is very gentle They embrace
Haruka lies in his arms

PETER (CONTD)
The first time I saw you you
looked like a scared little bird
So beautiful and fragile I was
enchanted

HARUKA
Enchanted

PETER
Yes Utterly

HARUKA
My favourite word

PETER
Little magpie

He suddenly starts rooting around in his bag

PETER (CONTD)
That reminds me

He removes a rounded wrapped parcel and hands it to Haruka

She slowly unwraps it to reveal a glass paper weight with the
image of Will and Kate’s smiling faces on their wedding day

Haruka is touched

HARUKA
Oh Peter

Peter moves in for a kiss

Holding her hands he raises her to her feet and they stand
facing one another He slowly begins to undress her bit by
bit like he’s now unwrapping a present Haruka watches him
closely

Now just in her underwear he places her gently on her bed
He removes his shirt does a nervous hair flick before a
little awkwardly hitting the lights before undressing
further

In the darkness they begin to have sex

Haruka becomes aware of a shadow lurking outside the bedroom
door With the hall light on and her room being dimly lit

she can see feet hovering outside Peter oblivious
continues

Not wanting to stop she attempts to reconnect but it ruins
the moment

INT HARUKA’S BEDROOM NIGHT
They lie in the aftermath of their union

HARUKA
You stay tonight

PETER
Of course I’m not going anywhere

HARUKA
And tomorrow I cook you special
dinner

PETER
I’1l put on a shirt and tie for the
occasion

Haruka beams Cuddling closer-

HARUKA
Tell me something nice

PETER
Like what

HARUKA
Anything

Peter thinks for a moment
PETER
Grandma must have been beautiful if
she looked like you
As he speaks Haruka’s face changes to a look of distaste She
turns away from him and takes something from her mouth with

horror

Peter strokes the hair on the back of Haruka’s head oblivious
to her actions behind him

She removes a few strands of thick bristly hair that almost
make her retch She quickly hides them under her pillow and
snuggles closer

Peter sits up with his hand searching for a drink The glass
he finds is empty

HARUKA
Thirsty

Peter nods

HARUKA (CONTD)
Me too I make tea

She gets up and holds Peter’s shirt She looks up
questioningly doing an action of putting it on

He nods

PETER
One moment

Peter reaches to get his phone

PETER (CONTD)
If you don’t mind

Haruka blushes He quickly takes a snap of her just in his
shirt

She leaves the room putting on her slippers and shutting the
door

INT KITCHEN NIGHT

Haruka enter the kitchen and boils the kettle She stands
watching it lost in thought

Derek hovers behind her watching
DEREK

Haruka jumps She stands feeling uncomfortable in her skimpy
attire

DEREK (CONT’D)
By Friday

Haruka remains silent- becoming panicked

DEREK (CONTD)
£300

Derek watches her carefully stepping closer

DEREK (CONTD)
Got it

Haruka shakes her head

DEREK (CONT’D)
Oh dear

Derek moves closer

PETER
Youll have it by the end of the
week

Peter’s standing at the door Haruka’s face is filled with
relief

DEREK
What a mug

Derek goes to leave laughing
Peter blocks his way Derek is mildly amused by this

PETER
We’re getting the locks changed
tomorrow Someone’s been in
Haruka’s room Stolen her passport

DEREK
She should have given it to me
then I did ask

PETER
If you go near her or upset her

DEREK
(intrigued)
You’1l1l

PETER
I’ll I mean it Derek if you so
much as look at her the wrong
way

DEREK
Listen to the big man

Suddenly losing his patience

DEREK (CONTD)
Get out my way

Peter stays where he is
DEREK (CONTD)
Or am I going to have to make you
blush in front of your new
girlfriend

Peter moves back watching Derek with a look of absolute
hatred

After he’s gone Peter kicks the bottom of the door in
frustration

EXT RIDLEY ROAD MARKET DAY

Haruka is wandering through the market She’s listening to
her Speak English tape Practising little phrases under her
breath

She steps inside the butchers

INT BUTCHER’S DAY

Chickens with their heads still attached are lined up on
hooks above the counter

Men in white shoes slush over the blood-coated floor laying
out rows of cows’ stomachs - their furry lining resembling
layers of coral

In her scrapbook in scrawled handwriting is the recipe for
Cathy’s shin and kidney casserole

Haruka places her headphones around her neck and stands
patiently waiting to be served The romantic melancholic
song heard before in the kitchen plays again on the radio

She waves to attract the attention of the butcher but he
doesn’t see her She continues to wait patiently

EXT FRUIT AND VEG STALL DAY

Haruka is buying potatoes and cabbage As the seller serves
her he shouts out to passers-by the different offers
available

She suddenly spots Derek He’s looking shady standing behind
one of the stalls

VEG SELLER
Yes sweetheart

Haruka is completely engrossed in watching Derek

VEG SELLER (CONTD)
Hello

She suddenly pays attention

VEG SELLER (CONTD)
(rudely now)
Three quid

HARUKA
Sorry

VEG SELLER
(pissed off)
Three quid

Haruka is distracted again for a moment as the Minicab Driver
now appears by Derek’s side holding a large bulging suitcase
He passes it to Derek in exchange for a wad of cash

VEG SELLER (CONTD)
Are you having a laugh

He throws the potatoes and cabbage back onto the stall

VEG SELLER (CONTD)
Who’s next

Haruka is moved to one side as an impatient woman steps up to
pay

HARUKA
Vegetables please

The veg seller completely ignores her

HARUKA (CONTD)
(becoming distressed)
Very important please
He has a change of heart

VEG SELLER
Here

He stands holding the veg out for Haruka to take
She’s distracted for a third time by a kerfuffle between
Derek and the Minicab Driver The latter is shouting at
Derek pointing to the money He pushes him hard against the
wall
By now the veg seller is thoroughly pissed off
VEG SELLER (CONTD)
(shouting at her)
Fuck off then you stupid bitch
Making me look like a dickhead

Haruka walks away from the stall shaken by his rudeness

Her eye catches that of the Minicab Driver who advances
towards her

She panics and begins to run pushing her way through the
market with him following close behind

She begins to black in and out forced to run blindly for
seconds at a time before her sight returns

Wherever she turns she sees the face of the Driver
approaching

As she runs she pushes past people dipping in and out and
around stall holders and their make-shift shops

She turns off the main street and down an alley

EXT SIDE STREET AFTERNOON

Slowing down she begins to feel very shaky she’s still
blacking in and out- her heart beat racing

Pressing herself against a wall her forehead is soaked in
sweat She fails to catch her breath and steady herself
collapsing in a heap on the floor

BLACKOUT

Coming around again a concerned crowd has gathered

Someone helps her to her feet She then dashes away

EXT MARKET EARLY EVENING
Rushing she drops her glove A kindly passerby notices

To get her attention he catches up reaching out to touch
her arm

Haruka’s so afraid by the unexpected contact that she breaks
into a frightened run - leaving the man holding the glove

INT HALL NIGHT
Haruka enters searching for Cathy Instead she finds Derek

HARUKA
Cathy

DEREK
She’s at work And Emilie’s
boyfriend got bored of waiting

Haruka turns to leave

DEREK (CONTD)
Hardly your guardian angel is he

She looks at him warily

DEREK (CONT’D)

What a loser Preying on foreign
girls because they can’t see what a
sad act he is

Turning to leave he blocks her way

DEREK (CONT’D)
Not so fast What about your rent

Haruka begins to back away as he moves forward forcing her
towards his office door

DEREK (CONTD)
Emilie enjoyed the benefits of
having me as a landlord

Derek has trapped Haruka in the doorway but she manages to
escape from him He laughs to himself as she runs into her
room

DEREK OS
Think about it

INT HARUKA’S BEDROOM NIGHT

Haruka locks the door and grabs her phone to call Peter but
it goes straight to answer phone Again and again she tries
to call him leaving tens of missed calls

She slumps down onto her bed

DREAM SEQUENCE

INT KITCHEN NIGHT

Haruka’s sat at the kitchen table with Cathy preparing food
Beside her is Peter and opposite Derek Both are dressed in
formal suits looking particularly smart patiently waiting
for their dinner

Derek begins to cough something is stuck in his mouth He
pulls out a long length of wool which is connected to
Haruka’s knitting

Cathy brings a large casserole dish to the table placing it
down in the middle She passes Derek the serving spoon and
takes a seat A scratching sound begins to come from inside

Derek stands to lift the lid

A desperate splashing can be heard as a live thing attempts
to escape

Suddenly Derek’s head lurches forward as if it’s being pulled
downwards towards the dish He looks down pushing his face
deep inside

Looking up he begins to laugh Everyone else joins in except
Haruka He then takes the ladle and pushes down hard until a
crunch can be heard Then silence

One by one Cathy Derek and Peter each pull out a clump of
their own hair and drop it into the casserole

DEREK
(gleefully)
Dinner’s served

He extends a hand to Haruka waiting for her to pass her
bowl She’s frozen unable to move

Waiting Everyone’s faces lose their smiles
The expectation is intense Still she doesn’t move

CUT TO

INT HARUKA’S BEDROOM NIGHT

Haruka wakes sitting up in bed panting scared She’s trying
to slow her breath when suddenly she is sharply pulled by her
ankles towards the bottom of the bed

She’s still dreaming

The bed sheets entwine her as she desperately tries to grab
at anything that might stop the dragging

She looks down to find herself standing at the bottom of the
bed holding onto a pair of kicking ankles

Across the room Grandma is sitting at the table watching
sternly in the mirror brushing her long hair

Haruka is again in the bed She finally catches hold of
something and clings on digging her nails into the sheets
They begin to soak through with water until the bed is
drenched- including her clothes and hair

Pulling back the sheets Haruka reveals that she’s clinging
onto Emilie’s dead bloated body

She tries to move away but she’s ravelled up inside

CUT TO

INT HARUKA’S BEDROOM NIGHT

Haruka lies awake her eyes wide open coming back to
reality

Her silhouette is delicate with the outline of her cheeks
dipping down to her chin and the slight curve of her chest
She slowly calms

Then suddenly a shape moves slightly beside her not of her
body She freezes momentarily with fear before slowly
turning over She finds Peter asleep by her side

She breathes a huge sigh of relief Lying beside him she
watches him sleep stroking the hair above his forehead
careful not to wake him

After a while she gets up She opens the door a crack Seeing
the empty hallway she leaves the room

INT HALL NIGHT

Haruka creeps silently in the darkness to the toilet

INT TOILET NIGHT

She opens the door and turns on the light to be confronted by
Derek’s dead body sitting on the toilet

His head has been cracked open on the porcelain sink and eyes
stare forward with mouth open in shock

INT HARUKA’S BEDROOM NIGHT

Haruka is sat motionless on the bed wrapped in a blanket She
looks utterly drained Police swarm the flat

Peter is packing her belongings as she sits in a complete
daze Cathy is standing at the doorway watching on

Hutchinson watches on
HUTCHINSON
You were both here all evening in

this room

PETER
Yes

HUTCHINSON
(to Haruka)
You can confirm this

Haruka nods silently - clearly in shock

HUTCHINSON (CONTD)
(to Cathy)
And you

CATHY
I was staying at a friend’s

Peter scoffs

PETER
Catch his name

Cathy gives Peter a withering look
HUTCHINSON
(to Haruka)

When do you go home

PETER
In three weeks

CATHY
You her mouth piece now

Peter ignores Cathy and continues to pack

HUTCHINSON
(dryly)
Of course- she’1ll be moving to
yours now The flat in Median
Close

CATHY
I want her to stay with me

Looking directly at Haruka

CATHY (CONTD)
I promised I’d look after you

HARUKA
Thank you I go with Peter

Peter smiles smugly
CATHY
Cmon darlin’ Stay with me Just
us girls We can watch your films
C’mon

HARUKA
I go with Peter

CUT TO

INT ELEVATOR DAWN

Haruka and Peter stand inside a grimy estate lift graffiti
covers the walls

The light is stark and the mirrors smeared with something
that looks like cream Haruka holds her hand to her nose
EXT PETER’S FLAT DAWN

Peter opens the door to his flat carrying Haruka’s bags It’s
dark and dingy ahead

She removes her shoes before entering Peter has already
stepped inside in his oblivious to her actions
INT PETER’S LIVING ROOM DAWN

When they are both inside he locks the door behind them
tossing the keys onto a side table

It’s messy but not disgusting The odd dirty plate lies on
the table A typical bachelor pad with a distinct lack of
natural light

Haruka’s face shows disappointment

HARUKA
Can’t we go to the country Why
London pad Driver might come

PETER
The police said not to go anywhere

HARUKA
I see driver fight with Derek
before Peter

Peter wraps his arms around Haruka and leads her towards the
sofa

HARUKA (CONTD)
What if he find me

PETER
Youre with me now Remember my
promise

She nods

PETER (CONTD)
You should have moved here after
Emilie’s death Here sit

Exhausted Haruka sits on the sofa Peter brings a quilt from
his bedroom firmly closing the door behind him and they
cuddle up together

CUT TO

INT LIVING ROOM EARLY EVENING

Haruka wakes as Peter is tiptoeing towards his bedroom door
He looks guilty- like he’s been caught out

PETER
I’m going to run you a bath We’ve
been asleep for hours

He disappears into the bathroom and the sound of water can be
heard

Haruka picks up Peter’s ipad and starts flicking through the
photos Images os the two of them in their happier times in
the park and in his shirt in her old bedroom

Her demeanor begins to change as she discovers more and more
photos - ones she had not been aware had been taken
Including the first day at Paddington snapped from a
distance

She looks up and Peter is standing in the doorway watching
her nervously

He quickly goes over and snatches it from her hands Without
bothering to turn it off he roughly places it in a drawer

PETER (CONT’D)
(sharply)
Your bath’s ready

Haruka nods meekly

CUT TO

INT KITCHEN NIGHT

Peter looks tense chopping vegetables pasta boils on the
hob Haruka sits in her pajamas hair wet from the bath

He’s watching her reflection closely in the glass of the
kitchen cupboards He hurries his preparations the knife
moving faster and faster on the board

He turns on the radio and the romantic melancholic song
heard before plays

Suddenly he stops chopping and goes to take her in his arms
We see the way in which his fingers press down into the
whiteness of her skin as he holds her close

Embracing they begin to sway in time to the music He spins
her and watches as she slowly twirls

Before he is able to pull her close again the pot of pasta
begins boiling over

He rushes to turn off the heat clumsily knocking Haruka and
stepping on her delicate silk slipper with his heavy
trainers

Haruka lets out a yelp wincing in pain

The moment’s over

INT KITCHEN MORNING

They sit eating breakfast while reading the news on Peter’s
laptop

NOTORIOUS HACKNEY BUSINESSMAN FOUND MURDERED IN FLAT THAT
REVEALS LINK TO ILLEGAL MEAT MARKET A string of raids and
arrests have been made overnight on Ridley Road Market

PETER
Disgusting look at that Imagine
eating rat for your dinner

Peter points to a picture of a large rat and continues to
read
PETER (CONT’D)
They suspect a rival meat dealer
killed him He was a shady bastard

HARUKA
And Emilie

PETER
Unrelated They’ve arrested a man
she was meant to be meeting that
night by the canal

Peter strokes Haruka’s hair as she places her head on his

shoulder

PETER (CONT’D)
It’s over

They stay like this for a moment

Then Peter’s phone begins to ring Seeing the caller he
jumps up jerking her head as he rushes out of the room to

answer it

Haruka stays sat at the table staring after him We

hear muffled talk from next door

Peter returns a little panicked

PETER (CONT’D)
I have to go somewhere

Haruka immediately sits up

HARUKA
I come Yes

PETER
(firmly)
No It’s a work thing I’1l be back

HARUKA

Peter’s face shows unease

HARUKA (CONTD)

HARUKA
She true friend from first day

PETER
(sharp)

HARUKA
Yes you too But

PETER
Am I not enough

HARUKA
Cathy is special I feel safe with

Peter’s face shows annoyance

HARUKA (CONTD)
And you With both

PETER
(angered)
It’s best you stop talking now
because this is really getting to
me

Haruka is quiet but Peter can’t help but carry on

PETER (CONTD)

Why would you want to be friends
with someone who actively dislikes
me

She’s struggling to understand
PETER (CONT’D)

You’re encouraging the past to
follow us

HARUKA
Peter please you scare me now
PETER
Don’t you get it Emilie would have
understood
HARUKA
(upset)

I don’t care about Emilie I just
want to be not on my own

Haruka begins to cry He softens

PETER
Look I’m sorry

He goes to take her hand wiping a tear from her cheek
PETER (CONTD)
Let’s not have cross words Friends
again
Haruka nods
PETER (CONTD)
I’ve got to dash or I’1l miss my

train I didn’t mean to upset you

Peter picks up his rucksack and kisses Haruka As he goes
leave

HARUKA
Tell me something nice

PETER
In the morning when I’m back

He kisses Haruka again

to

PETER (CONT’D)
Bye

HARUKA
Wait

She disappears for a moment returning with a knitted woolly
hat

HARUKA (CONTD)
Present I made

Peter beams and puts it on It’s a funny shape and looks a
little like a rolled condom rising to a peak He kisses
Haruka- thrilled

PETER
Thank you Bye

HARUKA
Bye

Haruka stands at the door and watches Peter depart

EXT PETER’S FLAT NIGHT
Haruka steps out wrapping her coat around her from the chill
As she turns the corner she’s suddenly grabbed from behind

BLACKOUT

INT CAFE NIGHT

Haruka comes round to find herself at one of the tables at
the back of the cafe under Derek’s flat

The Minicab Driver sits opposite Haruka is terrified

She looks up to the exit onto the market but men stand at the
front drinking cups of tea or smoking outside blocking her
passage

There’s a silence that overtakes the room Everyone speaks in
hushed whispers occasionally casting looks to the two of
them at the back aware of Haruka’ presence

A movement to her left She turns to find Ramla the preacher
with the little boy standing by her side

Haruka attempts to stand but Ramla presses her firmly on the
shoulder

MINICAB DRIVER
You keep running from me

Haruka refuses to look at him

MINICAB DRIVER (CONT’D)
Look at me

Her eyes dart anywhere but at him

He takes her hand and passes her a piece of paper As he does
we notice dry scabs from scratches on his lower arms

The driver stares intently into her face It’s a similar
image to the one she saw in the back of the taxi - the man’s
eyes and forehead Haruka refuses to meet his gaze

She opens the paper to read Peter’s scrawled handwriting of
Derek’s address For the first time she looks up meeting the
man’s eyes

CUT TO

INT TAXI NIGHT
Haruka is back to the night of the attack
She is now staring into his eyes in the mirror of his car

She becomes frightened desperately trying to open the door
to escape

Looking up she sees the contorted panicked look of the
driver

DRIVER
No

He leans across to grab her and we realise he’s restraining
her from falling out of the car She’s managed to open the
door and they drive with her perilously close to falling into
the busy road

She scratches at his arms desperate to free herself

The driver pulls the car over by Ridley Road

BLACK OUT

CUT TO

EXT RIDLEY ROAD MARKET NIGHT

Haruka is being carried by the Driver down the deserted
market

He arrives at Derek’s front door and knocks

INT CAFE NIGHT
OUT OF FLASHBACK
Haruka comes round in the room
HARUKA
(whispered)
You helped me

The man nods

HARUKA (CONTD)
I’m so sorry

MINICAB DRIVER
No more talk of this I want no
more trouble

She nods

HARUKA
I’m so sorry

As Haruka’s still speaking the driver gets up and leaves
Ramla and the child follow

She’s left alone at the table looking like she’s been kicked
in the stomach
EXT PETER’S FLAT NIGHT

Haruka walks down Peter’s street in a daze As she turns the
corner Cathy’s standing outside his flat

When she spots Haruka she starts to move towards her with a
suitcase in her hand

CATHY
Where the bloody hell have you
been

HARUKA
Cathy

The two embrace Cathy pulls away to go inside

CATHY
Come on

Haruka unlocks the door and they step in

INT PETER’S FLAT NIGHT

Haruka sits down numbly on the sofa

CATHY
What’s he doing to you

HARUKA
I was wrong about driver He helped
me Kind man I confused thought
Peter saved me

CATHY
Ha Is that what he told you

HARUKA
No

CATHY
He’s a compulsive liar

HARUKA
He’s not

CATHY
You’re coming with me You’re not
staying here another night

HARUKA
We leave London soon

CATHY
(worried)
What Where to

HARUKA

To live with parents We have
breakfast fresh eggs Peter teach
me to ride pony

CATHY
My god he’s fed you some lines

HARUKA
What

CATHY
C’mon now

HARUKA

No
Cathy’s becoming more intense- moving close to Haruka’s face
CATHY

He’s a control freak He’s the one
who took your passport not Derek

HARUKA
I defend you with Peter

Becoming increasingly upset and agitated
HARUKA (CONTD)
We had first fight about you

CATHY
Because he knows I’m onto him

HARUKA
Why can’t you see special Peter

CATHY
Listen you’re not safe here Let’s
go You can thank me later

Haruka is shaking her head defiantly

Pause

Pause

Haruka

Pause

Haruka

HARUKA
No

CATHY
Where is he now Hanging around a
train station waiting for a
vulnerable foreign girl to prey on
Wanting to offer his ‘help’

HARUKA
Don’t talk more

CATHY
Isn’t that how he met you Lurking
waiting to offer his services

CATHY (CONTD)
You know that’s how he met Emilie

covers her ears

is

CATHY (CONTD)
And we saw how that ended

CATHY (CONTD)
Well youre not going to be the
next one in a body bag

silent now

CATHY (CONTD)

Bringing you here isolating you

This talk of him saving you - like
butter wouldn’t melt He makes my

skin crawl so desperate so eager
to please

Haruka starts blacking out - her vision cutting in and out
The sound of Cathy’s ranting becomes muffled
Dizzy and unsteady on her feet she holds onto the table

The screen blacks again and this time the sound of her
heartbeat climaxes

It suddenly stops with the sound of white noise replacing it

The image returns to reveal Haruka holding a pen high above
her head

The screen cuts to black once more

When the image returns we see Cathy writhing in pain on the
floor the pen sticking deep into her ear

The screen cuts to black

The image returns to reveal Haruka now holding the paper
weight gifted to her by Peter

Cathy tries to get up but her balance is shot She stumbles
around as if in slow motion crawling to try and escape

Haruka strikes Cathy in the face with the paperweight

Cathy is floored Haruka strikes again this time with full
force to Cathy’s head killing her

Haruka stands in shock suddenly aware releasing the
paperweight it falls to the floor She’s horrified
EXT MARKET NIGHT
Haruka walks down the market in a daze
A fight breaks out in front of a pub as she passes
She walks on oblivious to the violence heading towards
Derek’s flat
EXT FLAT NIGHT
She stops outside and stares up at her old window
Derek’s voice suddenly can be heard
DEREK OS
He’s a loser Who preys on foreign

girls because they can’t see what a
sad act he is

INT HALLWAY NIGHT

Haruka is standing calmly in darkness outside the toilet
door

A cough comes from inside

The door opens and Derek sitting on the toilet looks up
annoyed

Before he knows what’s happening Haruka has stabbed him up
through the nose into his brain with her knitting needle

He dies immediately his head tilted back

Haruka pulls out the needle and the action makes his lifeless
head fall forward hitting the porcelain sink in front The
movement of his head is familiar from Haruka’s dream when he
lurched his head into Cathy’s casserole dish

The noise of his skull cracking is brutal

EXT CANAL NIGHT

Haruka now in a manic state is hurrying along the canal
Bikes pass whizzing close to her side and a dog barks
ferociously after her but she’s utterly unaware walking on

As she enters a tunnel shrouded in darkness we hear Emilie’s
voice

EMILIE
His eagerness can be mistaken by
those with more childish fantasies

The girls from Brick Lane can be heard again - shrieking with
high-pitched laughter

EMILIE (CONTD) OS
But then Peter would hardly fit
into your little book would he

Emilie is standing in front of the Towpath Cafe chatting on
her mobile phone laughing and joking

EMILIE (CONTD)
No no I’m waiting for Tom He’s
late as usual
She then laughs at what the person on the other end says

We stay back with Haruka watching from the shadows

Emilie is absent mindedly kicking the ground close to the
edge of the canal still chuckling

We see Haruka’s feet moving in her dainty shoes ina
similar way to how they criss-crossed up the stairs in her
first dream

Suddenly Emilie’s pushed into the canal

Landing in the freezing water she gasps for air

Her hands desperately cling on to the canal side Haruka
stands on her fingers deliberately and calmly until Emilie

loses her grip and slips back into the water

She tries to swim away attempting to shout for help but the
ice-cold water is filling up her lungs

Further along the bank she tries to get a hold of the edge
again

Haruka is there in an instant with her feet crushing down on
her trapped fingers

This time she steps on the fingers of both hands and then
leans over and holds Emilie’s head under the water

Emilie struggles frantically before her body becomes limp
The splashing stops and she begins to sink to the bottom- her
damaged fingers the last to disappear - being held up in the
water as if she is still appealing for Haruka’s mercy

EXT CANAL NIGHT

Haruka sits hunched over on the bench where she and Peter
previously placed the now wilted flowers for Emilie

Her head is hung low
A dog walker passes and stares momentarily before moving on

She’s lost to the world- utterly distraught

EXT COLUMBIA ROAD NIGHT

She walks purposefully down Columbia Road heading to Peter’s
flat - a determined look on her face

Her phone rings Her parents’ smiling faces appear She
cancels the call We see that there have been 27 previous
missed calls from them

She keeps on walking

INT PETER’S LIVING ROOM MORNING

Haruka is sitting on the sofa She’s still wearing her coat
her hair in disarray

The key turns in the lock and she immediately stands
Peter enters the room

PETER
Hello

He drops his bag to the floor locks the door and throws his
keys to the side table

PETER (CONT’D)
Hello

He sees her disheveled appearance

PETER (CONTD)
Are you alright

Haruka embraces him breathing him in nodding She doesn’t
want to let go Peter pulls himself away gently

PETER (CONT’D)
I’m sorry about Cathy I don’t know
why I got so worked up by it

HARUKA
You right She is past

Peter’s face shows surprise

HARUKA (CONTD)
Just you and me

He smiles and kisses her forehead

PETER

Beginning to take off his coat

HARUKA

HARUKA

HARUKA
Ok I bath you Then we go
Fresh start

She’s already leaving to run the bath

INT BATHROOM DAY

The room is filled with steam The mirrors are misted Peter
lies in the water

Picking up a sponge Haruka begins to wash his body with
great care and attention

He stops her taking her hand

PETER
Get in

Haruka hesitates

PETER (CONT’D)
Come on

She begins to take off her clothes We catch glimpses of her
body through the steam before she steps in

Resting her body against Peter’s chest he now sponges her
shoulders watching the water run down her skin

PETER (CONTD)
My mother’s ill I’ve been with her
today

She sits up and turns to look at him surprised

HARUKA
Why you didn’t tell me

PETER
I didn’t want you worrying After
all that’s happened it felt like
yesterday morning wed finally
found some peace

He pauses thinking
PETER (CONTD)
But she’s worse than I thought And
being an only child I have to

HARUKA
I help nurse her

PETER
No Haruka you don’t have to

HARUKA
- Yes We help together

She nods at him waiting for him to nod back

PETER
What would I do without my little
magpie

INT BEDROOM DAY

Haruka and Peter sit wrapped in their bath towels His phone
rings

PETER

He looks to Haruka

PETER (CONT’D)
She’s asking for me my mother Id

HARUKA
(determined)
-- Ok I come

PETER
Maybe I should go alone I didn’t
mention you to her today It might
be best if I first

HARUKA
- I come I stay at country
house We said we help together

Peter looks hesitant

PETER
Both of us might be too much for
her when she’s feeling poorly
There’s no rush

HARUKA
Peter please Don’t leave me
again

He’s thinking Then he smiles and flicks his hair back from
his eyes

PETER
Ok Why not We can stay in a BandB
nearby

HARUKA

So we both go
He smiles
PETER
Yes I can show you some of the
countryside and see if it matches
up to your little book

Haruka is elated showering him with kisses It quickly turns
more intimate and they begin to make love

During their intimacy the following images are cut amongst
Haruka’s ecstatic face

EXT FLAT DAY

Haruka and Peter locking up the flat carrying their bags to
a waiting taxi

INT COUNTRY HOUSE DAY

They arrive at a grand country house It’s the kind where Mr
Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet might ride up to greet them

INT BEDROOM DAY

They enter a room with a huge four poster bed embroidered
bed throw and chaise longue Haruka’s face is filled with
ecstasy

INT FLAT BEDROOM DAY

Sex over- They now lie together on the bed entwined back in
Peter’s Ikea bed

HARUKA
Peter

PETER
Yes

HARUKA

I do anything for you

PETER
I know Me too

He gives her a quick kiss and then leaps up

PETER (CONT’D)
Come on Let’s get our stuff
together and get out of here

Haruka thrilled also jumps up

INT LIVING ROOM DAY
Haruka is packing her shoes into her travel bag

Inside she finds her passport Surprised she quickly zips it
into the inside pocket of the bag

HARUKA
(calling out)
I think I need the wellington
boots

INT BEDROOM DAY

Peter is pulling shirts and jumpers from the wardrobe
throwing them onto the bed

PETER
(jovial)
Yes we’ll get them there And
maybe a tweed coat or a Barbour
jacket Make you look the real
deal

He crouches down keeping his face on the edge of the duvet
as he uses his hands to feel underneath the bed

He pats around for his suitcase not quite able to reach it
before it takes purchase of something

We see that it’s wet matted hair he holds in a tight grip

He tries to pull it out from under the bed but it’s heavy to
move

Peter looks confused

HARUKA OS
Is there a favourite pony for me to
ride Maybe little white one

He takes his hand out from the bed and sees it’s covered in
congealed dark blood and strands of matted hair

He bends down fully now to look under the bed It’s dark with
the duvet overhanging

HARUKA OS (CONT’D)
My black boots they good for
riding

Peter stands and cautiously lifts up the mattress leaning it
against the wall

HARUKA OS (CONT’D)
Peter

With one arm still holding back the mattress he looks down
Through the wooden slats of the bed Cathy’s dead eyes stare
back at him Her hair matted with blood from a gaping wound
that’s stained a halo of red onto the carpet
Haruka’s voice is becoming closer
HARUKA
Peter what do you think about

these for

Entering the room she drops the black boots when she sees the
discovery

Shocked he lets the mattress fall It lies diagonally
leaving Cathy still exposed

He stands in shock mind racing
He looks at Haruka in horror
HARUKA (CONTD)
She said bad things She wanted to
take me away from you

He’s too shocked to answer

HARUKA (CONTD)
She didn’t believe in us

A silence as he absorbs Haruka stands waiting
After a while-
PETER
(in disbelief)

Emilie Derek

HARUKA
They said you loser Soggy flannel

Peter looks like he’s been smacked in the face

PETER
Oh my god

She tries again to approach him to take his arm He moves
away terrified

HARUKA
Just you and me

Peter watches on in horror

HARUKA (CONTD)
I found my prince

Pause No response from Peter
HARUKA (CONTD)
I’m your little bird Enchanted
Remember
He begins to back away Haruka is becoming more urgent
HARUKA (CONTD)
We go to country we nurse mum
Have afternoon tea
He continues to move away from her

She looks around in desperation searching for her scrapbook

Finding it she quickly turns to the final pages She pushes
them towards him

HARUKA (CONTD)
Look Peter Look

She shows a montage in which she has stuck pictures of him
amongst those of herself at Madame Tussauds with Will and
Kate and against the country backdrops

HARUKA (CONTD)
This is our story

Peter shakes his head absolute fear in his eyes

PETER
No

Haruka has stepped as close to him as she can trapping him
in the corner

PETER (CONTD)
You’ve got it all wrong

Haruka looks at him questioningly

PETER (CONT’D)
You’ve got the wrong guy

HARUKA
No Peter

Shes becoming distressed her hand now raised to her temple
His words are weakening her

PETER
I grew up on an estate like this

Haruka shakes her head like a child before a tantrum She
covers her ears

PETER (CONTD)
- Not one with ponies

HARUKA
(screams )
No

Feeling dizzy she reaches out to steady herself

Peter acts quickly shoving her back against the wall with
considerable force then making a dash for it

Haruka falls to the floor eyes closed on her knees
hyperventilating hands pressed against her chest
INT LIVING ROOM DAY

Peter dashes to the front door pulling at it frantically but
it’s locked

He looks to the side-table but his keys aren’t anywhere to be
seen

Becoming frantic he throws things to one side before over-
turning the table

Suddenly he spots them- they’ve fallen between the radiator
and the wall

He throws a quick look to the bedroom It’s silent

Crouching down he grabs the keys which clang loudly against
the radiator

He turns to the lock In his hyper-nervous state he misses
the keyhole the first time second he comes closer

A noise next door and he is distracted something moving next
door the keys fall from his hand

He looks back again - silence now

Hastily he picks up the keys and manages to get the correct
one into the lock He turns it - then -

We hear a sickening thump His hands let go of the keys

Peter stumbles in shock clutching his head the blood
pouring

Haruka strikes him again and he falls to his knees in agony
He looks at her in disbelief

She continues to bludgeon him with a lamp made from onyx and
glass
The glass begins to break leaving a jagged top that cuts
through his flesh with each blow Her own fingers are ripped

to shreds

As she becomes more and more exhausted panting and heaving
with tears she stops and scoops him up in her arms

She holds him to her in the final moments of his life
Trapped within a body that has no strength to fight his
flickering eyes the only remaining sign of life

A prisoner in her arms she lies slumped over holding him
and gently rocking

He dies and silent tears roll down her face She stays in the
same position softly stroking his hair

Fade to black

EXT SOUTHBANK DAY
Open on a black screen

The sound of children laughing and people happily chatting by
the side of the Thames

The picture fades up to reveal a pair of eyes holding a
thousand yard stare

Haruka is revealed sitting on a bench wearing her headphones
her mouth moving silently along to the words

We pull out further to reveal that the headphones are not
attached to any device

We go wider again to show families enjoying their day out
Children playing chase and couples taking photos with
Westminster and Big Ben as a backdrop

Nobody pays any attention to Haruka

As we move out wider still she becomes a small figure lost
within the postcard view of London

Credits roll

FADE TO BLACK
