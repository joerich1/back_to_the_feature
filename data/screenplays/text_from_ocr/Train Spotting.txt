Screenplay by
John Hodge
Based on the Novel by
Irvine Welsh
Directed by

Danny Boyle

EXT STREET DAY
Legs run along the pavement They are Mark Rentons
Just ahead of him is Spud They are both belting along

As they travel various objects (pens tapes CDs toiletries ties
sunglasses etc) either fall or are discarded from inside their
jackets

They are pursued by two hard-looking Store Detectives in identical
uniforms
The men are fast but Renton and Spud maintain their lead

RENTON
(voice-over)

Choose life Choose a job Choose a career Choose a family
Choose a fucking big television Choose washing machines cars
compact disc players and electrical tin openers

Suddenly as Renton crosses a road a car skids to a halt inches from
him

In a moment of detachment he stops and looks at the shocked driver
then at

Spud who has continued running then at the Two Men who are now
closing in

on him

He smiles

INT SWANNEYS FLAT ROOM DAY

In a bare dingy room Renton lies on the floor alone motionless and
drugged

RENTON
(v0o)

Choose good health low cholesterol and dental insurance Choose
fixed-interest mortgage repayments Choose a starter home Choose
your friends

EXT FOOTBALL PITCH NIGHT

On a flood lit five-a-side pitch Renton and his friends are taking on
another team at football

The opposition all wear an identical strip (Arsenal) whereas Renton
and his
friends wear an odd assortment of gear

Three girls -- Lizzy Gail and Allison and Baby -- stand by the side
watching

The boys are outclassed by the team with the strip but play much
dirtier

As each performs a characteristic bit of play the play freezes and
their

name is visible printed or written on some item of clothing (T-
Shirt

baseball cap shorts trainers) In Begbies case his name appears as
a

tatoo on his arm

Sick Boy commits a sneaky foul and indignantly denies it
Begbie commits an obvious foul and make no effort to deny it
Spud in goal lets the ball in between his legs

Tommy kicks the ball as hard as he can

Rentons litany continues over the action

RENTON
(v0o)

Choose leisure wear and matching luggage Choose a three piece

suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics Choose DIY

and wondering who you are on a Sunday morning Choose sitting on

that couch watching mind-numbing sprit-crushing game shows

stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth Choose rotting away
at

the end of it all pishing you last in a miserable home nothing
more than an embarrassment to the selfish fucked-up brats you
have spawned to replace yourself Choose your future Choose
life

Renton is hit straight in the face by the ball He lies back on the
astroturf Voice-over continues

But who would I want to do a thing like that
INT SWANNEYS FLAT DAY
Renton lies on the floor

Swanney Allison and Baby Sick Boy and Spud are shooting up or
preparing to

shoot up Sick Boy is talking to Allison as he taps up a vein on her
arm

RENTON
(v0o)

I chose not to choose life I chose something else And the
reasons There are no reasons Who need reasons when youve got
heroin

SICK BOY

Goldfingers better than Dr No Both of them are a lot better
than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative
poor showing at the box office in which field of course
Thunderball was a notable success

RENTON
(v0o)

People think its all about misery and desperation and death and
all that shite which is not to be ignored but what they forget

Spud is shooting up

is the pleasure of it Otherwise we wouldnt do it After all

were not fucking stupid At least were not that fucking
stupid

Take the best orgasm you ever had multiply it by a thousand and

youre still nowhere near it When youre on junk you have only

one worry scoring When youre off it you are suddenly obliged
to

worry about all sorts of other shite Got no money cant get

pished Got money drinking too much Cant get a bird no chance

of a ride Got a bird too much hassle You have to worry about

bills about food about some football team that never fucking
winds about human relationships and all the things that really
dont matter when youve got a sincere and truthful junk habit

SICK BOY
I would say in those days he was a muscular actor in every
sense with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster
but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic

lead closer in that respect to Cary Grant

RENTON
(v0o)

The only drawback or at least the principal drawback is that
you

have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that -
INT PUB I NIGHT
Begbie smoking and drinking speaks to camera

BEGBIE

No way would I poison my body with that shite all they fucking
chemicals no fucking way

INT PUB I NIGHT
Tommy sits beside Lizzy He speaks to camera
TOMMY

Its a waste of your life Rents poisoning your body with that
shite

INT RENTON FAMILY HOME LIVING ROOM NIGHT

INT SWANNEYS FLAT DAY

Sick Boy and Spud lie drugged up Allison and Baby wait while Swanney

Renton is standing up

RENTON
(v0o)

From time to time even I have uttered the magic words
SWANNEY
Are you serious
RENTON
Yeah No more Im finished with that shite
SWANNEY
Well its up to you
RENTON

Im going to get it right this time Going to get it set up and
get off it for good

SWANNEY
Sure sure Ive heard it before
RENTON
The Sick Boy method
They both look at Sick Boy
SWANNEY

Yeah well it surely worked for him
RENTON
Hes always been lacking in moral fibre
SWANNEY

He knows a lot about Sean Connery

RENTON
Thats hardly a substitute

SWANNEY
youll need one more hit

RENTON
No I dont think so

SWANNEY

To see you through the night that lies ahead

Freeze Frame on Swanney

INT

RENTON
(v0o)

We called him the mother superior on account of the length of his
habit He knew all about it On it off it he knew it all Of

course Id have another shot after all I had work to do

RENTONS FLAT ROOM DAY

The door opens and Renton enters carrying shopping bags He empties
them on
to a mattress beside three buckets and a television

one

RENTON
(v0o)

Relinquishing junk Stage One preparation For this you will
need one room which you will not leave one mattress tomato
soup ten tins of mushroom soup eight tins of for consumption
cold ice cream vanilla one large tub of Magnesia Milk of

bottle paracetamol mouth wash vitamins mineral water
Lucozade pornography one bucket for urine one for feces and
one for vomitus one television and one bottle of Valium which
have already procured from my mother who is in her own
domestic
and socially acceptable way also a drug addict

Renton swallows several Valium tablets Voice-over continues

And now Im ready All I need is a final hit to soothe the pain
while the Valium takes effect

INT SWANNEYS FLAT DAY

Swanney Sick Boy Spud and Allison and Baby all lie inert while the
telephone rings

INT CALL BOX DAY
Renton curses as he slams down the receiver He dials again
RENTON
Mikey Its Mark Renton Can you help me out
INT MIKEYS FLAT DAY
Renton holds two opium suppositories in the palm of his hand

RENTON
(v0o)

This was typical of Mikey Forrester
(on screen)
What the fuck are these
(v0o)
Under the normal run of things I would have had nothing to do
with
the cunt but this was not the normal run of things

MIKEY

Opium suppositories Ideal for your purpose Slow release like
Bring you down gradually Custom fucking designed for your needs

RENTON
I want a fucking hit
MIKEY
Thats all Ive got take it or leave it

Renton sticks his hand down the back of his trousers and sticks the
suppositories into his rectum

Feel better now

RENTON

For all the good theyve done me I might as well have stuck them
up my arse

He smiles
EXT STREET DAY

RENTON
(v0o)

Heroin makes you constipated The heroin from my last hit is
fading away and the suppositories have yet to melt I am no

longer
constipated

He looks around the local amenities He is in discomfort clutching
his

abdomen and falling to his knees

He notices a betting shop

INT BETTING SHOP DAY

Renton walks through the crowded smoky betting shop towards a door
marked

toilet with a bit of card

RENTON
(v0o)

I fantasize about massive pristine convenience
He stumbles through
(v0o)
Brilliant gold taps virginal white marble a seat carved from

ebony a cistern full of Chanel No 5 and a flunky handing me
pieces of raw silk toilet roll But under the circumstances Ill
settle for anywhere
INT HORRIBLE TOILET DAY
This is the most horrible toilet in Britain
Alone Renton makes his way through the horrors to a cubicle
INT HORRIBLE TOILET CUBICLE DAY
Renton locks the door
He looks into the bowl and winces with disgust even in his state
He pulls the chain The chain comes off
He drops his trousers sits on the bowl and closes his eyes
MONTAGE
A lorry on a building site dumps a load of bricks B52s shed their

load on
Vietnam the Blue Peter elephant etc

INT CUBICLE DAY

Renton has his eyes closed They snap open

He looks down between his legs

He drops to his knees in front of the bowl and rolls his sleeve up

With no more hesitation he plunges his arm into the bowl and trawls
for the
suppositories

It seems to take ages He cannot find them He sticks his arm further
and

further into the toilet moving his whole body close He strains to
find it

His head is over the bowl now Gradually he reaches still further
until his

head is lowered into the bowl followed by his neck torso other arm
and

finally his legs all disappearing

The cubicle is empty
INT UNDER WATER DAY
Renton dressed as before swims through murky depths until he reaches
the
bottom where he picks up the suppositories which glow like luminous
pearls before heading up towards the surface again
INT HORRIBLE TOILET CUBICLE DAY
The toilet is empty
Suddenly Renton appears through the bowl then his arms as he lifts
himself
out Still clasping his two suppositories he walks out of the toilet
INT RENTONS ROOM DAY
The mattress buckets and supplies are laid out as before
The door opens and Renton enters still soaking and dripping
The suppositories are in his hand He holds them up and they twinkle
in the
light
RENTON
Now Now Im ready

INT RENTONS ROOM DAY

The cans of soup the bottle of water and the carton of ice cream are
empty the bottle of pills spilt the magazines well thumbed

Sick Boy throws across a worn copy of a film guide

Renton cannot be bothered to pick it up

How are you feeling since you came off the skag For myself Im

EXT PARK DAY

Typical weather neither good nor bad The park is nondescript arid
green
with a few bushes This is not Kew Gardens Renton and Sick Boy
appear
dressed as before but for the addition of cheap sunglasses

Renton is carrying a battered old cassette player and a carry-out in a
plastic bag

Sick Boy is carrying a small tatty suitcase from Oxfam

They scan the horizon and give each other the nod They walk towards
the
bushes

RENTON
(v0o)

The down side of coming off junk was that I knew I would need to

mix with my friends again in a state of full consciousness It
was

awful they reminded me so much of myself I could hardly bear to

look at them Take Sick Boy for instance he came off junk at
the

same time as me not because he wanted too you understand but

just to annoy me just to show me how easily he could do it

thereby downgrading my own struggle Sneaky fucker dont you
EXT

think And when all I wanted to do was lie along and feel sorry
for myself he insisted on telling me once again about his
unifying theory of life

PARK DAY

Seen through the telescopic sight of an air rifle that wanders over
various
potential targets (children pensioners couples gardeners etc)

it

EXT

SICK BOY

Its certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life
RENTON

What do you mean
SICK BOY

Well at one time youve got it and then you lose it and its
gone for ever All walks of life George Best for example had

and lost it or David Bowie or Lou Reed -
RENTON
Some of his solo stuffs not bad
SICK BOY
No its not bad but its not great either is it And in your
heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right its
actually just shite
RENTON
So who else
SICK BOY
Charlie Nicholas David Niven Malcolm McLaren Elvis Presley -
RENTON
OK OK so whats the point youre trying to make

PARK DAY

Sick Boy rests the gun down

SICK BOY
All Im trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the
Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward
trajectory

RENTON
What about The Untouchables

SICK BOY
I dont rate that at all

RENTON
Despite the Academy award

SICK BOY

That means fuck all The sympathy vote

RENTON
Right So we all get old and then we cant hack it any more Is that
it

SICK BOY
Yeah
RENTON
Thats your theory
SICK BOY

Yeah Beautifully fucking illustrated
RENTON
Give me the gun

EXT PARK DAY Through the sight again This time a Skinhead and his
muscle-bound dog are in view

Sick Boy and Renton talk like Sean Connery
SICK BOY
Do you see the beast Have you got it in you sights
RENTON

Clear enough Moneypenny This should present no significant
problem

The gun fires and the dog yelps jumps up and bites its owner (the
Skinhead)

SICK BOY
For a vegetarian Rents youre a fucking evil shot
EXT PARK DAY
Renton loads up again

RENTON

Without heroin I attempted to lead a useful and fulfilling life
as a good citizen

answer

any questions at all Nerves on the big occasion like a

footballer

RENTON
Try this
Renton unfolds silver foil to reveal some amphetamine Spud dips ina
finger
and takes a dab He nods in appreciation as he tastes it Renton
leaves the
packet in Spuds hand
SPUD

A little dab of speed is just the ticket

RENTON

Yes I can The truth -- well the truth is that Ive had a
long-standing problem with heroin addiction Ive been know to
sniff it smoke it swallow it stick it up my arse and inject it
into my veins Ive been trying to combat this addiction but
unless you count social security scams and shoplifting I havent
had a regular job in years I feel its important to mention

There is silence

A paper clip crashes to the floor

INT

OFFICE DAY

The same office The same team are interviewing Spud

one

no

SPUD

No actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you
wouldnt have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College
instead because theyre both schools right and were all in
this together and I wanted to put across the general idea rather
than the details yeah People get all hung up on details but
whats the point Like which school Does it matter Why When
Where Or how many O grades did I get Could be six could be

but thats not important Whats important is that I am right
That I am

MAN 1

Mr Murphy do you mean that you lied on your application
SPUD

Only to get my foot in the door Showing initiative right
MAN 1

You were referred here by the Department of Employment Theres

need for you to get you foot in the door as you put it
SPUD

Hey Right No problem Whatever you say man Youre the man

the
governor the dude in the chair like Im merely here But
obviously I am Here that is I hope Im not talking too much
dont usually I think its all important though isnt it
MAN 2
Mr Murphy what attracts you to the leisure industry
SPUD
In a word pleasure My pleasure in other peoples leisure
WOMAN
What do you see as your main strengths
SPUD
I love people All people Even people that no one else loves
think theyre OK you know Like Beggars
WOMAN
Homeless people
SPUD
No not homeless people Beggars Francis Begbie -- one of my
mates I wouldnt say my best mate I mean sometimes the boy
goes
over the score like one time when we -- me and him -- were
having

a laugh and all of a sudden hes fucking gubbed me in the face
right --

WOMAN

Mr Murphy leaving your friend aside do you see yourself as
having any weaknesses

SPUD

No Well yes I have to admit it Im a perfectionist For me
its the best or nothing at all If things go badly I cant be

I
bothered but I have a good feeling about this interview Seems
to

me like its gone pretty well Weve touched on a lot of
subjects
a lot of things to think about for all of us
MAN 1
Thank you Mr Murphy Well let you know
SPUD
The pleasure was mine Best interview Ive ever been to Thanks

Spud crosses the room to shake everyone by the hand and kiss them

RENTON

INT OFFICE DAY
The Woman and Two Men sit in silence
INT PUB 2 NIGHT

It is Saturday night in a busy city-centre pub on two levels On a
large
upper balcony overlooking the bar and floor downstairs sit Spud
Gail
Renton Sick Boy Tommy Lizzy and Begbie

Begbies story overlaps with the subsequent depiction of the incident

BEGBIE
(v0o)

Picture the scene Wednesday morning in the Volley Me and Tommy
are playing pool No problems and Im playing like Paul fucking
Newman by the way Im giving the boy here the tanning of a
lifetime So anyway it comes to the final ball the deciding
shot
of the tournament Im on the black and hes sitting in the
corner looking all biscuit-arsed Then this hard cunt comes in
Obviously fancied himself Starts looking at me Right fucking at
me Trying to put off like just for kicks Looking at me as if
to say Come ahead square go Well you know me Im no
looking
for trouble but at the end of the day Im the cunt with the pool
cue and Im game for a swedge So I squared up casual like So
what does the hard cunt do or so-called hard cunt Shites it
Puts down his drink turns around and gets the fuck out of there
And after that the game was mine

INT POOL HALL DAY

The events in the pool hall as described by Begbie
Begbie and Tommy are playing pool

Begbie is playing like a wizard

Tommy looks defeated

Lining up for the final ball Begbie is distracted by a large Hard Man
standing at the bar staring at him

Begbie stands up and walks slowly towards the Hard Man
They stand eye to eye for a moment
Begbie swings the pool cue slowly into his palm

The Hard Man turns and leaves

Begbie drinks the Hard Mans pint then pots the black with a
brilliant
shot

INT PUB 2 DAY
Begbie his story complete finishes his pint The others continue to
stare

at him frozen as though expecting something more Begbie smiles and
throws

the pint over his head

Freeze-frame the glass in mid-air and Begbies smiling face

RENTON
(v0o)

And that was it That was Begbies story Or at least that was

Begbies version of the story But a couple of days later I got

the truth from Tommy It was one of his major weaknesses he
never

told lies never took drugs and never cheated on anyone

INT TOMMYS FLAT DAY

Rentons hand flicks through a long row of videos on the floor while
the
sound of weights being lifted (by Tommy) emanates from nearby

Most of the videos are feature films or comedy shows some with titles
written in Tommys hand but two catch Rentons attention

They are 100 Great Goals and Tommy and Lizzy Vol 1 the latter a
handwritten title

Renton looks from the video round to Tommy who is engrossed in
lifting
weights

TOMMY

Well sure it was Wednesday morning we were in the Volley
playing
pool that much is true

INT POOL HALL DAY
Tommys account over a depiction of his version

TOMMY
(v0o)

But Begbie is playing absolutely fucking gash Hes got a
hangover

so bad he can hardly hold the fucking cue never mind pot the

ball Im doing my best to lose trying to humour him like but

its not doing any good every time I touch the ball I pot
something every time Begbie goes near the table he fucks it up
So hes got the hump right but finally I manage to set it up so
all hes go to do is pot the black to win one game and salvage a
little pride and maybe not kick my head in right So hes on the
black pressure shot and it all goes wrong big time What does
he do Picks on this specky wee gadge at the bar and accuses him
of putting him off by looking at him Can you believe it I mean
the poor cunt hasnt even glanced in our direction Hes sitting
there quiet as a mouse when Beggars gubs him with the cue He was
going to chib him I tell you then I thought he was going to do
me The Beggar is fucking psycho but hes a mate you know so
what can you do

The events are as follows

Begbie and Tommy are playing pool

Begbie furious miscues goes in off etc

Tommy deliberately misses sitters and tries to look annoyed

Begbie lines up to play the black It is unmissable

At the bar beyond sits a harmless young Man wearing the same clothes
as the

Hard Man in Begbies account except that they are now baggy rather
than

taut He is clearly not staring at Begbie but drinks a half-pint and
eats

some crisps

As Begbie plays the Man bites a crisp

Begbie miscues rips the cloth and the ball flies off the table

Tommy catches it and looks up to see Begbie assaulting the young Man

Tommy cautiously restrains Begbie and he reaches into his jacket for a
knife

Begbie turns and for a moment looks as though he might attack Tommy
INT TOMMYS FLAT DAY
Tommy puts down his weights
Renton holds up 100 Great Goals
RENTON

Can I borrow this one
INT PUB 2 NIGHT
The freeze-frame of the glass in mid-air and Begbies smiling face

RENTON
(v0o)

Yeah the guys a psycho but its true hes a mate as well so
what can you do Just stand back and watch and try not to get
involved Begbie didnt do drugs either he just did people That
what he got off on his own sensory addiction

The glass falls into the crowd

Screaming starts A Woman is bleeding from a wound in her head The

Men

beside her turn furiously around to look for the source of the glass

Up on the balcony Begbie stands up The screams and shouting continue
below

Begbie appears at the bottom of the staircase down from the balcony
He strides towards the bleeding Woman and begins shouting
BEGBIE

All right Nobody move The girl got glassed and no cunt leaves
here until we find out which cunt did it

A man stands up from one of the tables

MAN

And who the fuck do you think you are

Begbie kick the Man in the groin Another moves towards him but is
blocked

by the Men surrounding the girl Soon the whole mass dissolves into a
brutal

scrum in which Begbie plays a prominent part

Up on the balcony the rest of the gang watch in silence

INT RENTONS FLAT DAY

The empty cover for 100 Great Goals lies on the floor

Sick Boy and Renton sit dispassionately watching Tommy and Lizzy in

their
home-made soft-porn video
RENTON
(v0o)

And as I sat watching the intimate and highly personal video
stolen only hours earlier from one of my best friends I realized
that something important was missing from my life

INT CLUB NIGHT
A mass of dancing bodies fills the floor The music is very loud

At the side of the dance floor sit Tommy and Spud The look rather
gloomy
There is an empty seat beside each of them Spud is drinking heavily

Tommy turns and speaks to Spud His lips move but nothing is audible
Spud
is not ever aware that Tommy has spoken

Tommy bellows in Spuds ear

Tommys words and all subsequent conversation in the dance area of the
club

appear as subtitles the characters communications somewhere between
speech

and mime

TOMMY
Hows it going with Gail

SPUD
No joy yet

TOMMY
How long is it

SPUD
Six weeks

TOMMY
Six weeks

SPUD

defined from then on in

Standing nearby but apart from them is Renton
Renton notes Spud and Tommy with their partners and across the other
side

Sick Boy and Begbie are engaged in flirtatious conversation with Two
Women
RENTON
(v0o)

The situation was becoming serious Young Renton noticed the
haste

with which the successful in the sexual sphere as in all others

egregated themselves from the failures

Begbie and Sick Boy with the Two Women

Renton standing among a group of lone nerds

Renton wades on to the dance floor looking at countless women all
whom

either turn away or are spoken for

RENTON
(v0o)

Heroin had robbed Renton of his sex drive but now it returned
with a vengeance And as the impotence of those days faded into
memory grim desperation took hold in his sex-crazed mind His

post-junk libido fuelled by alcohol and amphetamine taunted him
remorselessly with his own unsatisfied desire dot

Renton notices one girl (Diane) walking on her own towards the door
A Man carrying two drinks catches up with her and walks backwards
talking
to her
She says nothing He blocks her way
She takes one drink and downs it then the other handing him back the
empty
glasses She steps past him and walks on towards the door
(v0o)
And with that Mark Renton had fallen in love
EXT STREET NIGHT
The Girl walks away from the club scanning the street for a taxi and
hail
one which stops just as Renton calls out

RENTON

Excuse me I dont mean to harass you but I was very impressed
by

situation I thought to myself shes special

have
enough No matter how often you go out and rob and fuck people over

always need to get up and do it all again Renton smiles and waits

SHERIFF

because shoplifting is theft which is a crime and despite

what you may believe there is no such entity as victimless
crime

Heroin addiction may explain your actions but it does not excuse

them Mr Murphy you are a habitual thief devoid of regret or

remorse In sentencing you to six months imprisonment my only

worry is that it will not be long before we meet again Mr
Renton

I understand that you have entered into a programme of

rehabilation in an attempt to wean yourself away from heroin The

suspension of your sentence is conditional upon your continued

cooperation with this programme Should you stand guilty before
me

again I shall not hesitate to impose a custodial sentence

affliction

falling

glasses Begbie punches him in the face and knees him in the groin A
fight
breaks out between the Man and Begbie Sick Boy rushes forward to
restrain

His eyes are fixed on the bag while his hands fiddle Begbie stabs

Spud in

Renton swivels and stands up

And the bag

Renton lifts the bag and slowly approaches Begbie Renton nervous

shaking pulls a packet of cigarettes from a pocket and holds it
towards

deeply and then blows the smoke towards Renton

the bag

holding it close Renton gets up and goes to the small bathroom He
puts the

light on above the mirror and looks at himself He washes his face and
drinks a glass of water then walks back to the bedroom Renton pulls
on his

jacket and shoes He stands over Begbie then reaches carefully down
to life

Begbies arm up As he does so he realizes that Spud is watching him
They

say nothing Renton takes the bag Begbie stirs but does not wake

Renton looks down at Spud for a moment before unzipping the bag He
pulls
