THE COSMOS

We are moving through an immense starfield staggering in its
scope and depth Passing by strange and unfamiliar planets
This universe as alien to us as it is serenely hypnotic

The voice we hear is female Dignified and soothing

JAINA (V0)
At the beginning the immortal
Titans created the cosmos Seeding
it with light and with life
Bringing order to chaos

Were aware of a STRANGE ENERGY moving with us among the
planets and stars Like a shadow dark ribbons of energy
unlike any cosmic phenomenon we recognize

JAINA (V0)
But even among immortals there is
discord The great Titan champion
Sargeras once charged with
protecting the worlds they had
created from the powers of
darkness fell from grace and was
cast out from their pantheon Left
to wander the Great Dark alone

As we follow the ribbons of energy they begin to take on
darkly malevolent shapes Almost as though sentient alive

JAINA (VO)

Embittered and vengeful Sargeras
vowed to destroy all that the
Titans had created He marshalled
the very forces that he had once
fought against to create the
Burning Legion - a vast army of the
demonic the infernal the corrupt

The ribbons of energy pass by vibrant life-filled planets
And as they do so the planets become discolored and dark as
though a WAVE OF CORRUPTION is passing over them

JAINA (V0)
The Legion travelled to world after
world spreading their corruption
Turning peace into war Love into
hate Order back into chaos

We move ahead of the ribbons’ path to find a NEW WORLD one
as yet untouched by the Legion’s corruption Moving closer
into the planet’s orbit A dark featureless sphere
JAINA (V0)
Only one world remains unclaimed by
the Legion One crafted by the
hands cf the Titans themselves
their most ancient and precious
jewel And Sargeras’s final most
coveted prize

The SUN RISES over the horizon bathing the planet in light
Revealing vast oceans and continents teeming with life

JAINA (V0)
Azeroth

As we move over the world we get a sense of its geography
Three continents separated by an ocean with a whirling
maelstrom at its center On one side the EASTERN KINGDOMS
To the west the great land mass of KALIMDOR And to the
north the frozen wastes of NORTHREND

We move closer passing over the Eastern Kingdoms soaring
over great snow-capped mountain ranges and lush forests As
we pass through swirling clouds we are BLINDED by a glimpse
of the rising sun beyond and as the light dissipates

THE CLASH OF STEEL SWORD AGAINST SWORD

The sun now blazing high overhead TWO WARRIORS square off
against one another on a dusty barren battlefield one is a
TAUREN - a mighty humanoid with cloven hooves and horned
bovine features The other a TROLL - tall muscular and blue-
skinned with fearsome tusks and a shock of fiery red hair

The Tauren and Troll fight with sword and shield Parrying
and lunging in a brutal battle to the death Evenly matched
But after a furious flurry of blows the Tauren WOUNDS THE
TROLL who staggers backward dropping his sword

The Tauren capitalizes on the opening CHARGING THE TROLL and
knocking him to the ground defenseless The great horned
beast stands over his helpless opponent raises his sword and
PLUNGES IT THROUGH THE TROLL’S CHEST He pulls out the bloody
sword raises it aloft and emits a BELLOWING WAR CRY

-joined now by the ROAR OF AN TUMULTUOUS CROWD As we ANGLE
UP to reveal that this is not a battlefield but a VAST
COLISEUM THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS CHEERING WILDLY

This is GURUBASHI ARENA
We move over the crowd - an eclectic mish-mash of Azeroth’s

many exotic races HUMANS DWARVES GOBLINS GNOMES And many
more all crowded into the amphitheater’s cheap seats

GOBLIN VENDORS move along the aisles selling exotic snacks

GOBLIN VENDOR
Peanuts Get your peanuts Salted
Murloc eyes ten copper a bag

Above the cheap seats are tiers of VIP PRIVATE BALCONIES The
best seats in the house One such box adorned with ROYAL BLUE
STANDARDS EMBLAZONED WITH A GOLDEN LIONS HEAD What we will
come to recognize as the INSIGNIA OF THE ALLIANCE

TWO SENIOR MILITARY OFFICERS in full dress regalia are
ushered into the box One is ADMIRAL DAELIN PROUDMOORE -
Human late 50s gray-haired Tall and distinguished The
other is a stocky grizzled DWARF sporting a bright orange
‘beard As they settle into their luxurious seats an
ATTRACTIVE HUMAN WAITRESS delivers a tray of foaming beers

STORMPIKE
I‘’ll say this for the Alliance
Membership has its privileges

He takes a beer and chugs it down in one pull wipes the foam
from his beard and delivers a hearty BURP He leafs through a
PROGRAM the cover of which reads

GURUBASHI ARENA ONE DAY ONLY

DIRECT FROM KALIMDOR - LEGENDARY HUMAN CHAMPION LO’GOSH
BATTLING EASTERN KINGDOMS CHAMPION TARGORR THE DREAD
ADMISSION ADULTS 5 GOLDCHILDREN AND GNOMES 250
FUN FOR ALL THE FAMILY TWO DRINK MINIMUM

STORMPIKE
So d’ye reckon hes real this lad

PROUDMOORE
Well find out soon enough
(beat)
Do you

STORMPIKE
A Human Champion of all Kalimdor
Nah It’s a stunt something to
bring in the crowds They probably
painted an Ore pink

Stormpike continues paging through the program Stops at a
crude illustration of a FEARSOME-LOOKING HUMAN GLADIATOR The
caption reads “LO’GOSH - THE ORC SLAYER”

STORMPIKE
“LoGosh”
PROUDMOORE
Thats what the Orcs call him It
means Ghost Wolf The only Human
theyve ever deemed worthy of an
Orcish name

Proudmoore looks down at the arena floor A pair of GIANT
OGRES are fighting against a pack of Humanoid-Hyena GNOLLS

PROUDMOORE
Oh I think he’s real all right
And I think he’s going to be
exactly what we need

The battle below comes to an end the chattering sharp-
toothed Gnolls victorious As the bodies of the dead Ogres
are hauled away the ARENA MASTER OF CEREMONIES walks to the
center of the arena and a hush falls over the crowd

GURUBASHI MC
And now ladies and gentlemen what
youve all been waiting for - the
main event Many of you have heard
the stories Of a feral Human child
found by a tribe of Orcs in the
wilds of darkest Kalimdor Raised
by them as one of their own taught
to live like them fight like them
Yes a Human man - but with the
savage heart of an Orc

You could hear a pin drop in the arena right now

GURUBASHI MC
Many of you believed he was but a
legend But he is real - and now he
is here for the first time in the
Eastern Kingdoms And so without
further ado I give you the
undisputed champion of Dire Maul
and of all Kalimdor - the Ghost
Wolf Lo’Gosh

The crowd GOES INSANE as the heavy wooden doors to the arena
floor grind slowly open Everyone on their feet straining to
peer inside as from the darkness within he emerges

LO’GOSH Stripped to the waist his sun-burnished body ripped
with muscles Straggly matted hair obscuring his features
But we see that his face is daubed with CRUDE WAR PAINT

He walks out to the center of the arena There’s a feral
animalistic quality to the way he moves

But unlike the gladiators who preceded him Lo’Gosh does not
play to the crowd nor even acknowledge them The roaring of
the crowd dies down This isn’t quite what they expected

GURUBASHI MC
And who better to challenge him
than the Eastern Kingdoms’ very own
champion Once the most feared of
the Ores’ dreaded Blackrock clan
Bane of the Alliance during the
bloody First and Second Wars
Leader of the infamous Stormwind
Stockade riots Undefeated in fifty-
nine battles to the death I give
you Targorr the Dread

The gates at the other end of the arena creak open A mixed
chorus of CHEERS AND BOOS erupts from the crowd as TARGORR
emerges A towering muscular ORC with obsidian-black skin
yellowing tusks and burning savage eyes he is led out by
FOUR HUMAN HANDLERS using metal poles hooked to an AN IRON
COLLAR around his neck Corralled like a dangerous beast

Targorrs handlers unhook their poles and retreat hurriedly
back inside the arena doors Targorr steps up to Lo’Gosh and
looks him up and down with a contemptous GRUNT The giant Orc
is easily twice the Human’s size and weight To lock at them
it is simply no contest

STORMPIKE
Bloody hell He’s gonna get
murdered

Proudmoore says nothing Just watches rapt

WEAPONS are tossed into the arena before the two combatants
A battle-axe a sword and a couple of battered shields
Targorr looks around the arena soaking in the sights and
sounds of the crowd Then glares murderously at Lo’Gosh

TARGORR (SUBTITLED ORCISH)
Kathak gul-cholar Kil Zug-kra
thkshek la-tar

(Enjoy this moment Human It will
be your among your last)

LoGosh responds in Orcish Speaking it like a native

LOGOSH
Gruldar mosh-taka thek
(Only if you fight a whole lot
better than you smell)

BEAT Targorr a little thrown to hear this Human speaking
Orcish so fluently He picks up the axe and a shield Lo’Gosh
does not move He seems almost meditative in his stillness

Targorr hefts the axe and lumbering forward SWINGS IT AT
LOGOSH Lo’Gosh SPRINGS INTO ACTION tumbling out of the
axe’s path and grabbing up the weapons on the ground before
him All in one single incredibly agile fluid movement that
draws a collective GASP from the crowd

Targorr turns to face Lo’Gosh with an annoyed grunt The Ore
comes at him again a powerful side-swipe that Lo’Gosh
deflects with his shield almost knocking him off his feet

Targorr rains down blows that take all of Lo’Gosh’s strength
to deflect His shield BUCKLES under the relentless barrage

Up in the Alliance box Stormpike checks his pocket watch

STORMPIKE
This is what we came all this way
to see C’mon if we leave now we
can beat the traffic

But Proudmoore doesn’t take his eyes off Lo’Gosh Watching
intently as though waiting for something he knows will come

PROUDMOORE
It’s not over yet

And as we go back to the arena floor we see that each heavy
lumbering swing of Targorr’s axe is taking more and more out
of him And still this irritating little Human will not go
down The Orc puffs and pants short on breath

As Lo’Gosh deflects yet another blow we catch a glimpse of
his eyes behind the matted hair and the war paint Sharp and
laser-focused Cunning The eyes of a predator

And then comes the opening he’s been waiting for As a tired
fTargorr makes another big swing he over-reaches dropping
his shield for a fraction of a moment - but it’s enough

LO’GOSH LUNGES AT TARGORR summoning energy he had merely
been conserving SLASHING THE ORC’S UNPROTECTED CHEST with
his sword Targorr ROARS WITH PAIN as he staggers backward

The audience is on its feet watching in amazement as Lo’Gosh
PRESSES THE ATTACK wailing at Targorr with a furious
savagery that almost seems more Orc-like than Human

Targorr fights back desperately but Lo’Gosh is just too fast
feinting with incredible speed and agility to avoid every
blow then countering with another withering attack

Targorr finally manages to break free and the two fighters
separate Circling each other Targorr is wounded and
bleeding Exhausted Lo’Gosh hasnt even broken a sweat

Enraged Targorr summons his remaining energy and RUSHES
LOGOSH whirling his axe Bringing it down with a ROAR

---as Lo’Gosh SLIDES BETWEEN TARGORR’S LEGS rolling back to
his feet behind him Targorr’s axe BURIES IN THE EARTH where
Lo’Gosh was just a split-second ago He blinks confused

«»and then his eyes WIDEN in shock A sudden sharp intake
of breath The crowd looks on in silent astonishment

A rivulet of blood trickles from Targorr’s mouth As he looks
down to find THE BLADE OF LO’GOSHS SWORD protruding from his
chest Driven clean through him from behind

LoGosh puts his foot to Targorr’s back and YANKS THE BLOODY
SWORD FREE Targorr slumps to his knees and topples forward
like a felled oak hitting the ground with an almighty CRASH

LoGosh stands over the mortally wounded Targorr as the Ore
rolls over onto his back gasping Defeated And from
somewhere at the back of the crowd comes the cry

GURUBASHI AUDIENCE MEMBER (0S)
Finish him
ANOTHER CROWD MEMBER picks up the cry It quickly spreads to
a chant among the entire audience “Finish him Finish him”

In every other movie this is the moment where the heroic
gladiator throws down his sword in defiance nobly refusing
to take the beaten man’s life But this is not that movie

Without hesitation LoGosh CHOPS OFF TARGORR’S HEAD with a
executioner’s swing of his sword On an adrenaline-fueled

high he raises his fists aloft and emits a BLOOD-CURDLING
ORCISH WAR CRY that echoes to the far reaches of the arena

LO’GOSH
Loktar ogar

Victory or death The crowd ERUPTS IN CHEERS AND APPLAUSE

In the Alliance box Stormpike turns to Proudmoore

STORMPIKE
All right - I’m impressed So now
what

PROUDMOORE

Now we meet him
INT GURUBASHI ARENA - GLADIATOR HOLDING PEN

Dark lit only by sputtering torchlight Dank stone walis
straw strewn across the floor A dungeon-like feel

Proudmoore Stormpike and a callow young ALLIANCE AIDE look
on as Lo’Gosh is brought in by SLAVE HANDLERS His skin caked
with dirt and dried blood He does not resist as the handlers
clap his wrists in manaclies chained to the wall

PROUDMOORE
Leave us

GURUBASHI SLAVE HANDLER
He’s dangerous

PROUDMOORE
Well be fine

The handlers file out the door We dont fully see Lo’Gosh in
his dark corner where he is shackled just the sound of his
slow metered breathing from the shadows

Lo’Gosh does not acknowledge the presence of his visitors He
turns his back on them takes a wet cloth from a nearby wash
bowl and begins to wash off the blood and dirt

PROUDMOORE
(to his aide)
Introduce us

The aide clears his throat and speaks in stilted ORCISH

ALLIANCE AIDE
Throm-Ka Gorek Lash kaga-

Lo’Gosh cuts him off speaking in SUBTITLED ORCISH

LO‘GOSH
Your Orcish is terrible boy

Lo’Gosh steps out of the shadows as he cleans the war paint
from his face And we get our first good look at him
Strikingly handsome piercing eyes Two CRISS-CROSS SCARS
etched across his face Difficult to tell his age Late 30s

LO’GOSH
If youre going to speak it that
poorly youll have to come closer
So I can hear you

The aide nervously takes a step forward Lo’Gosh moves
closer his chains scraping the floor behind him He looks
the aide up and down sensing his fear

and LURCHES FORWARD chains pulling taut as he BARKS at
the aide like a wild dog The startled aide stumbles backward
and falls on his backside Lo’Gosh laughs amused

Stormpike draws a FLINTLOCK PISTOL from his belt cocks it

STORMPIKE
Back in your corner laddy

BEAT LoGosh stares Stormpike down unafraid Then steps
back Proudmoore motions to Stormpike to lower the pistol

Lo’Gosh turns to Proudmoore And speaks in PERFECT ENGLISH

LO’ GOSH
Who are you

BEAT Proudmoore taken by surprise

PROUDMOORE
We were told that you only spoke
Orcish

LO’GOSH

I know your language But in
Kalimdor I have little use for it

Proudmoore motions to the Alliance aide to leave He bows and
exits happy to be out of Lo’Gosh’s company

PROUDMOORE
I am Admiral Proudmoore of the
Alliance This is Colonel
Stormpike We come here in the name
of the King himself to offer-

LO’GOSH
The King of what

PROUDMOORE
The King of Stormwind what else

LO’ GOSH
Never heard of it

A BOWL OF FOOD is dumped through a slot near the foot of the
door Some vile discolored gruel Proudmoore watches in
fascination as Lo’Gosh grabs it and wolfs it down hungrily
eating messily with his hands Like an animal

PROUDMOORE
So then the stories are true You
really were raised by Orcs

LO’GOSH
Ive lived among them for as long
as I can remember

PROUDMOORE
What happened to your family

LOGOSH
I have no memory of my family My
earliest memory is of an Orcish
trainer putting a wooden sword in
my hand and teaching me to fight

PROUDMOORE
Well I commend him That was an
impressive display out there You
fight like no warrior Ive ever
seen Swift and calculating like a
Human powerful and merciless like
an Orc The best of both worlds

LO’GOSH
I’m not a soldier If this King of
yours wants me to fight in a war-

PROUDMOORE
On the contrary we were hoping you
might help us prevent one What do
you know of the OrcishHuman wars

LO’ GOSH
I am a gladiator The world I know
begins and ends in the arena

PROUDMOORE
Well I’m sure you don’t need any
education in Orcish savagery In
the First War they invaded our
lands and burned our cities to the
ground Nearly destroyed all of
Humankind But we survived

STORMPIKE
In the Second War we drove the
bastards back Those we didn’t kill
or take prisoner fled back across
the sea to Kalimdor Since then
theres been peace - or what passes
for it

PROUDMOORE
But now the Orcs are rising once
again regrouping under the banner
of a new warlord named Vanndar
li

STORMPIKE
They call him Thrall sir

A brief glimmer of recognition from LoGosh

PROUDMOORE
You know of him

LO’GOSH
Ive heard the name

PROUDMOORE

Under his rule the Orcs are
aggressively expanding their
territory Last week a patrol from
our outpost in Theramore was hit by
one of their raiding parties Six
of our men butchered like animals

(beat)
Our ambassador there has been
trying to establish diplomatic
contact Naturally the Alliance
Council is skeptical given our
history We are to sail to Kalimdor
to evaluate the situation and if
possible forestall an escalation
that could lead to another war Id
like you to come with us

LO’GOSH
Why

PROUDMOORE
Frankly the Orcs are still largely
a mystery to us We know very
little of them other than as a
primitive war-like culture But
youve lived among them You know
how they operate how they think
You could be very useful to us as
an advisor

LOGOSH
The affairs of nations are no
concern of mine And if Humans were
foolish enough to settle on Orcish
lands they deserve everything they
have coming to them

STORMPIKE
I find it interesting that you
speak about Humans in the third
person Like you don’t consider
yourself one of them
LOGOSH
First rule of survival in the arena
- protect your own ass first My
loyalty is to myself Not to any
race
(off Proudmoore’s uniform)
«»enor any flag

PROUDMOORE
So you wont help us

LOGOSH
Sometimes back home I hear the
slave owners discussing politics
Its never sounded appealing to me
At least in the arena I know who my
enemies are

PROUDMOORE
What about freedom Might that
sound appealing to you

Lo’Gosh reacts It’s not a word he hears often

PROUDMOORE
The Alliance has authorized me to
buy you out of bondage Serve your
King faithfully on this mission and
when it is done he will sign
papers granting you free passage
throughout the Eastern Kingdoms No
more living among the Ores You’1l
be Human again

Lo’Gosh turns away darkening a little
LO’ GOSH
I dont what it means to be Human
I never have
PROUDMOORE
Im offering you the chance to find
out If you want it
BEAT Lo’Gosh turns back Considering it thoughtfully

LO’ GOSH
Krazzik will never allow it

PROUDMOORE
Whos Krazzik

LO’ GOSH
My owner

INT GURUBASHI ARENA - OFFICE - DAY

The Goblin KRAZZIK sits at a desk poring over the box-office
takings Green-skinned and diminutive with long pointy ears
and teeth as sharp as his wits Krazzik has a wild shock of
hair and is dripping with gaudy jewelry A Goblin Don King

Proudmoore and Stormpike stand before him Krazzik looks
flustered he speaks with a grating HIGH-PITCHED SCREECH

KRAZZIK
No no no Everybody always wants
a piece of my star attraction But
you can’t have him End of the week
he’s on a boat back to Kalimdor

PROUDMOORE
The Alliance would of course be
willing to compensate you

KRAZZIK
Hello Are you deaf Read my lips
Not Interested

Stormpike gets in Krazzik’s face growls menacingly

STORMPIKE
We’re trying to be nice here big-
ears We could just take him Ever
hear of eminent domain

KRAZZIK

Big-ears he calls me Look at that
nose Like an over-ripe beetroot
Get that thing out of my face

(to Proudmoore)
I know my rights I’m a citizen of
Kalimdor here on business - the
Alliance has no jurisdiction over
me or my property

PROUDMOORE
You refuse to even negotiate

KRAZZIK
Do you have any idea how much that
Human brings in at Dire Maul each
week The crowds love him And he
never loses Id be a fool to sell
him at any price

Proudmoore motions to two ALLIANCE SOLDIERS who bring in a
CHEST and set it down on the floor Proudmoore opens it up -
it’s HEAVING WITH GOLD PIECES Krazzik’s eyes widen

KRAZ2ZIK
Well of course everythings
negotiable

Krazzik jumps down from his desk to examine the gold An
absolute fortune He sifts his hands through it drooling

KRAZZIK
One hour I’1l have him delivered
to you at the service entrance

PROUDMOORE
The Alliance thanks you

As Proudmoore and Stormpike turn to leave

KRAZZIK
Word to the wise Dont ever turn
your back on him Hes only Human
on the outside Deep down he’s one
of them An animal And hell turn
on you first chance he gets

BEAT as Proudmoore and Stormpike let the advice sink in
EXT BOOTY BAY - DAY

A MOUNTED ALLIANCE CONVOY moves through the streets of BOOTY
BAY the bustling trading port that is home to Gurubashi
Arena Proudmoore riding alongside Stormpike notices the
Dwarf’s furrowed brow

PROUDMOORE
Something bothering you Vanndar

STORMPIKE

How do we know we can trust him He
said himself he has no loyalty to
us If we get out there and find
ourselves toe-to-toe with the Orcs
and he has to choose a side like
the slaver said he’s only Human on
the outside I don’t like it

PROUDMOORE
You worry too much I think he’s
going to be a great asset There’s
something about this man I can’t
quite place it

Farther back along the Alliance caravan MOUNTED GUARDS ride
alongside a REINFORCED CARRIAGE with barred windows

INT REINFORCED CARRIAGE — CONTINUOUS

Lo’Gosh sits alone in the darkened carriage the only light
the beams of sunlight that shaft through the barred window
onto his face He gazes blankly ahead inscrutable

PROUDMOORE (V0)
-ebut I think he has a lot of
potential

EXT ELWYNN FOREST - DAY

A lush woodland Birds chirp in the treetops as we soar
overhead passing a busy LOGGING CAMP a SHIMMERING LAKE and
a SMALL HUMAN VILLAGE Its pastoral peaceful

CRANE UP to reveal in the distance a breathtaking site
STORMWIND CITY

A sprawling metropolis of stone and iron Great towers and
spires reach for the clouds The entire city surrounded by a
PERIMETER WALL fortified with guard towers A fortress

Inside Stormwind’s many bustling districts and tree-lined
parks are connected by bridges criss-crossing a great canal
system Architecturally stunning Stormwind is the center of
Human civilization and the Alliances capital

GUARDS posted at the main gates salute as the Alliance convoy
enters the city Passing through the gates and into

THE VALLEY OF HEROES

A broad promenade lined by TOWERING STATUES of heroic figures
from Azerothian history Titanic warriors in armor who hold
their swords aloft in victorious poses Lo’Gosh peers out
from his carriage window as they pass by looming over him

INT STORMWIND - BARRACKS - DAY

The convoy pulls up outside a MILITARY BARRACKS where
Alliance troops wait to receive them As Proudmoore and
Stormpike disembark the guards unlock Lo’Gosh’s carriage and
bring him out under close watch Lo’Gosh still looking back
at the statues in the Valley of Heroes

LO’GOSH
Who are they

PROUDMOORE
Heroes of the Alliance They gave
their lives in the Orcish Wars so

that we might be free
(MORE)

PROUDMOORE (CONTD)
(beat)
Who knows perhaps one day you’ll
do something worthy of a statue in
your name

STORMPIKE

(snorts)
Not bloody likely

(to the guards)
Get him cleaned up He might think
like an Orc but he doesn’t have to
smell like one And stay with him
at all times If he has to piss so
do you

PROUDMOORE
It’s been a long trip get some
rest Big day tomorrow

LOGOSH
What happens tomorrow

STORMPIKE
You meet the King

INT STORMWIND BARRACKS - SHOWER ROOM - DAY

LoGosh stripped naked is shoved into a tile room by a
group of Alliance guards A bar of soap is tossed at his
feet Lo’Gosh sniffs it puzzled The guards look amused

LoGosh is BLASTED with cold water from a hose as the guards
heckle and laugh When all the dirt is blasted from his body
a guard throws a scoop of LIME POWDER over him

STORMWIND GUARD
Cant have you bringing any Orc
diseases in here can we Who knows
what you mightve caught off ‘em

The guard makes the mistake of getting a little too close to
Lo’Gosh as he sneers Lo’Gosh HEAD-BUTTS him sending him to
the ground with a bloody nose The other guards RUSH HIM
wrestling him to the ground fists flying

INT STORMWIND BARRACKS - LO’GOSH’S QUARTERS - NIGHT

LoGosh cleaned-up and sporting fresh bruises is shoved
inside by a pair of guards who bolt the door behind him

LoGosh looks around Stone walls a simple bed and table An
adjoining WASH ROOM with a toilet Lo’Gosh lifts the wooden
lid and peers into the bowl not sure what to make of it He
pulls the chain and jumps back startled when it FLUSHES

The only window is barred Lo’Gosh looks down at the city
streets below Tugs on the bars to test them They’re bolted
fast into the stone wall no chance of escape He sighs

EXT STORMWIND CITY -— DAWN

The sun rises over the great city casting its cathedral
spire and other great monuments in its lambent glow

INT STORMWIND BARRACKS — LO’GOSH’S QUARTERS - MORNING

The morning sunlight shafts through the barred window Two
guards unlock the door and step inside surprised to see

Lo’Gosh ASLEEP ON THE FLOOR curled up in sheets and covers
pulled from the bed The guards look down at him amused

STORMWIND GUARD 3
Oi Wake up

The guard nudges Lo’Gosh with his foot As he stirs the other
guard tosses clothes at him A simple jerkin pants boots

STORMWIND GUARD 3
Get your arse dressed Don’t want
to be late for the King now do we

EXT STORMWIND KEEP - DAY

The seat of power in Stormwind a great castle at the heart
of the city To establish

INT STORMWIND KEEP - WAR ROOM — DAY

A large oak table is the centerpiece of this grand military
council chamber Campaign maps and shields adorn the walls
The torchlight is low - a serious “situation room” feel

Proudmoore and Stormpike talk with other ALLIANCE OFFICERS as
Lo’Gosh is escorted in under guard dressed in his new
civilian clothes Hair tied neatly back

STORMPIKE
By the Titans He looks almost
Human

Proudmoore walks over to greet him As the other Alliance
officers approach he leans in close and whispers

PROUDMOORE
These are very important people Do
not embarrass me in front of them

As the other officers arrive regarding him curiously

PROUDMOORE
Allow me to introduce Lo’Gosh This
is Admiral Jes-Tereth of Alliance
Naval Command Marcus Jonathan
High Commander of Stormwind
Defense Marshal Windsor our Chief
of Military Staff

Guards snap to attention as a TALL BEAUTIFUL WOMAN sweeps
into the room Dressed in elegant flowing robes there is a
regal splendor to the way she carries herself The Alliance
officers genuflect as she approaches

PROUDMOORE
Lady Prestor

LADY KATRANA PRESTOR
Admiral

There is a sense of acute icy-cold intelligence about
Prestor No-nonsense Her attention quickly turns to Lo’Gosh

LADY KATRANA PRESTOR
So this is the famous Ore expert
weve all heard so much about

PROUDMOORE
Lo’Gosh this is Lady Katrana
Prestor council chair and senior
advisor to the King

Lo’Gosh just stares at her Stormpike kicks him in the ankle
He shifts awkwardly not practiced at polite conversation

LO’GOSH
I am Lo’Gosh

LADY KATRANA PRESTOR
Yes Id gathered that Well I’m
afraid the King’s been detained
well have to proceed without him

STORMPIKE
Are we sure that’s—

LADY KATRANA PRESTOR
Shall we

Prestor motions to the table Everybody sits
LADY KATRANA PRESTOR

So Admiral your forces are ready
to depart

PROUDMOORE
They are my Lady I leave for
Ironforge today to oversee the
final preparations

ADMIRAL JES-TERETH
The plan is still for three armored
divisions Artillery cavalry

PROUDMOORE
And the fourth eleventh and eighty-
second light infantry battalions
Well be ready for any-

Proudmoore is cut off as a TRUMPET SOUNDS A FANFARE

ALLIANCE PAGE (0S)
All rise for the King

Surprised everyone quickly rises to their feet All except
Lo’Gosh not familiar with royal custom Stormpike grabs him
by the collar and hauls him up out of his chair

The guards stand to attention as ANDUIN WRYNN enters the
hall King of Stormwind Crown Defender of the Alliance

And all of SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD

LoGosh looks at the young King startled Anduin Wrynn is
small for his age not a commanding physical presence Still
learning how to carry himself as King not comfortable with
the crown he wears on his head A boy in a world of men

LADY KATRANA PRESTOR
Your majesty We were not expecting
you I thought you were at study

KING ANDUIN WRYNN
I dismissed my tutor for the day I
wouldn’t want to miss such an
important meeting of the council

Anduin takes his seat at the head of the table

KING ANDUIN WRYNN
Please continue

Everyone sits back down

PROUDMOORE
-As I was saying the fleet will
set sail tomorrow evening and be in
Theramore by weeks end If we-
KING ANDUIN WRYNN
Excuse me Admiral - the fleet I
was under the impression this was a
diplomatic mission Why are you
sailing with a force of arms

PROUDMOORE

Sire our first priority is of
course to prevent an outbreak of
hostilities But should we fail we
must be prepared for the worst
Theramore is our only foothold in
Kalimdor - if it fell to the orcs
it could pave the way for another
invasion of the Eastern Kingdoms

MARCUS JONATHAN

Indeed This new Orc nation grows
more powerful by the day And now
we hear that they may have formed a
pact with the Tauren If they’re
allowed to continue this expansion
unchecked we could face a new war
not just against the Orcs but an
entire horde of hostile races

Anduin looks unsure Notices that Stormpike seems so

KING ANDUIN WRYNN
Colonel

STORMPIKE
Sire my concern is that to arrive
with such a force may only inflame
an already delicate situation The
Ores have never exactly been
difficult to provoke

KING ANDUIN WRYNN
My people have endured two wars in
as many decades They have no
appetite for another If there is
any chance of a lasting peace I
will not squandered it by rushing
headlong into confrontation

LADY KATRANA PRESTOR
With all respect your majesty -
your father also believed in peace
with the Orcs He believed in
appeasement And that belief got
him killed You simply cannot
afford to be as naive as he was
Too many lives depend upon it

too

BEAT An uncomfortable moment as we see the mention of his
father touches a personal - and painful - nerve with Anduin

ADMIRAL JES-TERETH
»»»sperhaps our new expert on the
Ores could lend us some insight

Suddenly all eyes at the table are on Lo’Gosh who finds
himself hesitant to speak Proudmoore raises his eyebrows at
him expectantly Lo’Gosh shifts in his chair uncomfortable

LO’ GOSH
Orcs understand strength They
respect it For weakness they have
only contempt If you try to
negotiate with them out of fear
they will smell it on you And
attack without hesitation

PROUDMOORE
Precisely If we are to achieve
peace it must be through strength

LADY KATRANA PRESTOR
Sire you do have it in your power
to prevent another war You can
succeed where your father failed
by learning from his mistakes We
must not shrink from this threat
but confront it and confront it
now Before it is too late

Anduin looks around the table The eyes of his senior
officers are on him waiting for a decision More than ever
the young King feels the weight of the crown upon his head

Lo’Gosh observes the boy as he wrestles with his conscience
Clearly uncomfortable with this course of action but not
strong enough to go against the will of the council

KING ANDUIN WRYNN
Ive always trusted your advice
Katrana We must do what you think
is right of course
(uncertain)
Peace through strength

And with that he stands and walks away

LADY KATRANA PRESTOR
A wise decision your majesty

LoGosh watches Anduin as he exits the room Noticing the
defeated look on his face

INT STORMWIND CITY - DEEPRUN TRAM TERMINAL

Proudmoore Stormpike and Lo’Gosh descend a flight of stone
steps to enter Stormwind’s DEEPRUN TRAM TERMINAL Lo’Gosh is
shackled and closely watched by his GUARD DETAIL

If the New York Subway had existed during the Renaissance
this is what it might have looked like Two cobblestone
platforms lined with ornate masonry columns and passenger
benches of mahogany and brass The dark entrance to the
subway tunnel surrounded by elaborate neo-gothic archways

But there is evidence of technology here too PHOSPHORENT
STRIP LIGHTS glow overhead A DEPARTURE BOARD illuminated
with a strange pulsating energy updates arrivaldeparture
times The overall feel a “Steampunk” hybrid of old and new

LO’GOSH
What is this

PROUDMOORE
Fastest way to Ironforge
Underground We can thank the
Gnomes for their ingenuity

As A WHOOSH OF AIR rushes over the platform

GNOMISH VOICE (PA)
Tram now arriving at platform one

We see LIGHTS inside the tunnel Approaching fast And a
GNOMISH TRAM CAR thunders into the station LEVITATING on a
field of magnetic energy As it comes to a halt the
passenger guard rail retracts with a hydraulic HISS

GNOMISH TRAM DRIVER
All aboard Mind the gap

Everyone embarks and the guard rail raises behind them

GNOMISH TRAM DRIVER
Buckle up Next stop Ironforge

Lo’Gosh’s guards strap him into his seat and buckle up beside
him as Proudmoore and Stormpike take their seats opposite
The Gnome driver throws a lever and the tram moves out of the
station with the low hum of its magnetic propulsion system

INT DEEPRUN TRAM TUNNEL

The tram races through the tunnel at high speed lights
whizzing by in the darkness

LoGosh watches in amazement as the tram passes through a
GLASS SECTION OF TUNNEL MARINE LIFE teeming in the blue sea
beyond Like racing through a vast wondrous aquarium

A rush of air and the glare of headlights in the tunnel ahead
precede ANOTHER TRAM hurtling past on the adjacent rail
headed in the opposite direction toward Stormwind

Under cover of the tunnel’s darkness Lo’Gosh inches a hand
toward his seatbelt buckle and quietly releases it He
remains still like a snake poised to strike Waiting

ANOTHER SET OF HEADLIGHTS appears in the tunnel ahead as a
tram approaches from the opposite direction Lo’Gosh waits
another moment timing it carefully

and then ELBOWS THE GUARDS SEATED BESIDE HIM IN THE FACE
AND POUNCES FROM HIS SEAT Rushing to the guard rail
Stormpike releases his seatbelt and lunges forward to grab
Lo’Gosh - just as he LEAPS OVER THE RAIL

AND ONTO THE OTHER TRAM AS IT HURTLES PAST Rolling
expertly to cushion the fall coming to a stop at the feet of
a dozen startled Human and Dwarf passengers

Proudmoore and Stormpike look back in dismay as Lo’Gosh’s
tram speeds away from them in the opposite direction

PROUDMOORE
Stop the tram Now

The driver HITS THE EMERGENCY BRAKE bringing the tram to a
screeching halt

PROUDMOORE
Turn us around

GNOMISH TRAM DRIVER
I cant Theres safety regulations—

PROUDMOORE
I said turn around

Reluctantly the driver works the controls and the tram begins
to move back in the other direction Picking up speed

LoGosh gets to his feet looks back to see Proudmoore’s tram
in pursuit He turns to the tram’s driver

LO’ GOSH
Make this thing go faster

GNOMISH TRAM DRIVER 2
I I can’t-
24

Lo’Gosh lifts the Gnome out of his seat and dumps him on his
butt behind him Pushes on a lever and the tram ACCELERATES
TO HIGH SPEED The hapless passengers hold on for dear life

Proudmoore sees Lo’Gosh’s tram moving away up ahead

PROUDMOORE
He’s getting away Faster

The Gnome driver accelerates to keep pace Both trams now
hurtling along the rails at breakneck speed

Proudmoore’s tram gains until its alongside Lo’Gosh’s Two
of Proudmoore’s men JUMP THE RAILS onto Lo’Goshs tram The
first draws his sword but with his shackled fists Lo’Gosh
KNOCKS THE SWORD FROM HIS HANDS sending it pinwheeling away
into the tunnel then FLOORS HIM WITH A HEAD-BUTT

The second man rushes Lo’Gosh and the two men GRAPPLE HAND-TO-
HAND Though shackled Lo’Gosh is more than a match for the
soldier twisting his arm in a crippling hold and THROWING
HIM FACE-FIRST INTO THE GUARD RAIL knocking him out cold

Lo’Gosh goes back to the tram controls and pushes the
throttle to maximum accelerating away Stormpike grabs a
FLINTLOCK RIFLE and takes aim at Lo’Goshs tram

PROUDMOORE
He’s no good to us dead

STORMPIKE
I’m not aiming for him

Stormpike sights down the rifle and FIRES The shot
glances off a metal plate partially obscuring a spaghetti-
like mass of CABLES AND HOSES on the tram’s underside

GNOMISH TRAM DRIVER
Shoot the power line The red one

Stormpike FIRES AGAIN The bullet slicing clean through a
GREEN HOSE The severed hose SNAKES WILDLY VENTING STEAM

GNOMISH TRAM DRIVER
No that’s the regulator You hit
the velocity regulator

LoGosh’s tram SURGES FORWARD Lo’Gosh pulls back on the
throttle but it has no effect The passengers SCREAM

Lo‘Gosh braces for impact as the lights from the STORMWIND
TRAM STATION appear up ahead Coming up fast

INT STORMWIND CITY - DEEPRUN TRAM TERMINAL -— CONTINUOUS

COMMUTERS waiting at the platform see the tram approaching
But something is wrong - it’s coming in way too fast The
rush of air from the tunnel blasting them The commuters back
up then TURN AND FLEE as Lo’Gosh’s tram BARRELS INTO THE
STATION AND CRASHES INTO THE BUFFERS

COUGHING AND SPLUTTERING is heard through the steam venting
into the buckled tram cabin Electrical sparks shower from
overhead Lo’Gosh emerges from the cloud of steam staggering
onto the platform As it dissipates behind him we see the
buckled-in passengers dazed but unharmed

Proudmoore’s tram glides into the station on the other rail
Stormpike leaping onto the platform before it even comes to a
halt and bolting to chase Lo’Gosh down

STORMPIKE
Stop that man

A pair of ALLIANCE SOLDIERS at the station exit rush to
intercept Lo’Gosh swords drawn Lo’Gosh effortlessly takes
them both out - but before he can reach the stairs Stormpike
TACKLES HIM FROM BEHIND Pulling him to the ground like an
attack dog as more Alliance soldiers rush to help

Lo’Gosh struggles wildly but there are two many guards on
him now As he’s finally subdued Proudmoore approaches

PROUDMOORE

I can see you still have a lot to
learn about being Human When we
give our word we keep it So be
assured of my sincerity when I
promise you this - if you try to
escape again I will consider it an
act of treason against the Alliance
and see you hang for it

(beat)
You want your freedom And youll
have it - when I’m finished with
you

(to Stormpike)
Colonel please see to it that he
gives us no further trouble between
here and Ironforge

STORMPIKE
With pleasure sir

LOGOSH’S POV looking up at Stormpike as the Dwarf takes
his rifle with both hands and DRIVES THE BUTT INTO HIS FACE
Filling the frame with a THUD as we CUT TO BLACK

INT BEDCHAMBER - DAY

LoGosh wakes from a nightmare Sweating feverishly He
climbs out of bed trying to get his bearings Still smarting
from the rifle-butt welt on his forehead

This stone-walled bedroom has strangely low ceilings and
UNFAMILIAR RUNES carved into the walls Lo’Gosh looks at the
heavy oak door Wide and low - hed need to hunch over to get
through it He tries the handle locked

Daylight streams through a window arch leading to a BALCONY
Like the door wide and low No bars to prevent escape
Lo’Gosh stoops to pass through the arch and emerge onto

BALCONY

And now we see why there is no need for bars The balcony
protrudes from the side of a ROCKY MOUNTAIN FACE Sheer and
unscalable Lo’Gosh stands THOUSANDS OF FEET FROM THE GROUND
close to the mountain’s snow-capped peaks STONE BATTLEMENTS
jut out from within the mountain built into the living rock

This is IRONFORGE An entire city carved out from inside the
mountain Breathtaking And utterly impregnable

Far below a COLUMN OF ALLIANCE TROOPS marches out from
within the torch-lit belly of the mountain through a pair of
gigantic iron doors The troops head down a lowland path
toward a distant coastline - where a FLEET OF ALLIANCE SHIPS
is anchored waiting to receive them

INT IRONFORGE - MILITARY WARD - DAY

The interior of Ironforge is a vast network of cavernous
vaulted halls No windows for daylight to penetrate only the
flickering of torchlight chandeliers Broadways connected by
bridges that span RIVERS OF MOLTEN IRON The deep rumbling of
the subterranean earth ever-present

DWARF BLACKSMITHS work at forges and anvils hammering white-
hot metal into swords and other bladed weapons Welding
sparks fly as a small army of GNOME ENGINEERS work on a
variety of LARGE MACHINES of iron and wood Only partially
assembled their purpose unclear - but they appear to be
different varieties of ARMORED VEHICLES

Stormpike stands at the center of the activity arguing with
an oil-spattered goggle-wearing GNOME FOREMAN

STORMPIKE
Dont give me any excuses I want
this lot finished today

The foreman shouts something back at Stormpike in GNOMISH
waving a wrench around agitated as Proudmoore arrives

PROUDMOORE
Problem Colonel

STORMPIKE
Now theyre saying theres a
Thorium shortage - most of the
mechanized armor won’t be finished
for another two days

PROUDMOORE
I don’t want to delay my arrival in
Theramore I‘ll sail with the
Lightbringer today as scheduled
Youll follow with the rest of the
fleet as soon as the armor’s ready

Stormpike nods turns to watch MORE COLUMNS OF ALLIANCE
TROOPS filing past toward the Ironforge gates

STORMPIKE
Sure were bringing enough men

PROUDMOORE
I’m not taking any chances We
wont know how strong these Orcs
really are until we get out there
And if it comes to battle Id
sooner have too many sword arms at
my side than too few

Proudmoore looks admiringly at the high-tech machines being
assembled by the Gnomish engineer corps

PROUDMOORE
Besides it wont be swords that
will win the day It’ll be this
Technology the way of the future
A new age of warfare The Orcs
won’t even know what hit them

STORMPIKE
If it comes to battle

PROUDMOORE
You lost a brother in the last war
didn’t you Colonel

STORMPIKE
Aye sir At Khaz Modan

PROUDMOORE

Then you should understand better
than most my commitment to
preventing another Id thank you
not to question it again

(beat)
Nobody wants a war less than I But
if war it must be I want it over
and done with A quick decisive
victory

STORMPIKE
Couldn’t agree more sir

Proudmoore moves off

STORMPIKE
Sir I never knew your sons But I
know they both died heroes And I
know theyd be proud of what you’re
trying to do

BEAT Proudmoore gives Stormpike a nod of acknowledgement
then moves off cloak trailing behind him as we DISSOLVE TO

AZEROTH - MAP VIEW

The world of Warcraft laid out on a classical parchment-style
map The Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor separated by the Great
Sea and the whirling maelstrom at its center

We chart a SNAKING RED LINE as it departs from the Eastern
Kingdoms and heads across the Great Sea arcing south around
the maelstrom as it heads toward an ISLAND connected by a
narrow sliver of land to the Kalimdor coast DISSOLVE TO

EXT THE GREAT SEA - DAY

The Alliance flagship RSS LIGHTBRINGER - a mighty man-o-war
bristling with heavy cannons - ploughs across the ocean

LIGHTBRINGER DECK

Proudmoore stands at the ships bow Gazing not out to sea
but at an OLD SILVER LOCKET in his hand He opens it to
reveal two faded sepia-toned portraits of a pair of BRIGHT
FRESH-FACED YOUNG ALLIANCE SOLDIERS Their similarity to each
other - and to Proudmoore - is noticeable

Proudmoore looks at the faces of his two sons with
immeasurable sadness Interrupted by the bellowing voice of

CROWS NEST LOOKOUT (0S)
Land ho

Proudmoore looks up to see an ISLAND COASTLINE emerging
through the fog-shrouded horizon He snaps the locket closed

PROUDMOORE
Prepare to make port

The Lightbringer’s small army of deckhands spring into
action running out rigging adjusting sails

Proudmoore turns to see LO’GOSH standing on the foredeck
behind him As always shackled and flanked by his guard
detail He motions for the guards to bring Lo’Gosh forward

PROUDMOORE
I’m going to unshackle you Don’t
Make me regret it Theramore is an
island city walled and guarded on
all sides Theres nowhere to run
Remember what I told you and we’ll
get along just fine Is there an
understanding between us

LoGosh nods Proudmoore’s guards unlock his shackles

PROUDMOORE
Chief of the Watch run up the
colors if you please Id prefer
not to have to bring this ship into
port under cannon fire

The ALLIANCE FLAG is run up the mainmast It unfurls
flapping in the breeze as we move ahead of the Lightbringer
past its bow and through the fog that lies ahead to reveal

KALIMDOR

Our first glimpse of this vast new frontier Coastal
marshlands giving way to rolling savannahs and mist-shrouded
mountain ranges a mysterious untamed land If the Eastern
Kingdoms are Europe Kalimdor is more like darkest Africa

Protruding prominently from Kalimdor’s coastline is
THERAMORE ISLE

A thriving coastal city surrounded by a HIGH PERIMETER WALL
punctuated with guard towers and battlements A BRIDGE WITH
PORTCULLIS GATE connects the island city to the mainland

Many ships are docked at a BUSY HARBOR loading and off-
loading every kind of exotic merchandise A DOCKYARD MARKET
buzzes with activity as TRADERS sell everything from fresh
fish to animal furs

CHILDREN run through the cobblestone streets A CHOIR
performs outside a church for donations GUARDSMEN patrol the
perimeter walls vigilant In the town center a combined
MILITARY BARRACKSTOWN HALL capped with a breathtaking spire

ALARM BELLS SOUND from the watchtowers As GUARDS muster in
response concerned TOWNSFOLK congregate and gossip

Through the commotion we find LADY JAINA PROUDMOORE (30s)
striding purposefully toward the harbor Beautiful and
graceful but possessed of a powerful inner strength

She is flanked by a pair of THERAMORE GUARDS and accompanied
by her personal aide BUTTONWILLOW - a FEMALE GNOME As they
enter the HARBOR Jaina approaches the DOCKMASTER

JAINA
Who are they

THERAMORE DOCKMASTER
We don’t know ma’am I don’t have
any arrivals scheduled for today

THERAMORE GUARD
Bloodsails

JAINA
There’s no pirate alive foolish
enough to attack this city
(beat cautious)
Have the perimeter cannons stand
ready just in case

The guard dashes off to see to her orders In a watchtower
above a LOOKOUT lowers his spyglass and shouts down

THERAMORE LOOKOUT
Theyre flying Alliance colors

JAINA
How many masts

THERAMORE LOOKOUT
Four masts ma’am

On hearing this Jaina appears wary

BUTTONWILLOW
My Lady

JAINA

EXT THERAMORE ISLE - HARBOR - DAY

The Lightbringer heaves into port and weighs anchor CREWMEN
rope off the ship as Proudmoore strides down the gangplank
Lo’Gosh and his guard detail a few paces behind

Proudmoore beams when he sees Jaina waiting for him at the
end of the dock A smile she only half-heartedly returns He
approaches arms outstretched

PROUDMOORE
Jaina It warms my heart to see you
again It’s been too long

They embrace Again Jaina not entirely comfortable in her
father’s presence There is history between these two

JAINA
Father What are you doing here

PROUDMOORE
Must I have a reason to visit my
own daughter

Jaina just looks at him cynical He relents

PROUDMOORE
You know why I’m here This
situation with the Orcs is of great
concern to the Alliance The King
sent me to see that it’s resolved

JAINA
You mean Prestor sent you Since
when did the King make his own
decisions about anything

Jaina looks behind Proudmoore at the arriving Lo’Gosh

PROUDMOORE
This is Lo’Gosh my advisor on
Orcish affairs Lady Jaina
Proudmoore magistrate of Theramore
and ambassador to Kalimdor

LoGosh and Jaina exchange looks Jaina clearly unsure of
what to make of this man Lo’Gosh for the first time seems
a little disarmed in the presence of this woman

JAINA
LoGosh “Ghost Wolf

PROUDMOORE
You speak Orcish now

JAINA
I’m learning How else are we to
engage them in discourse rather
than battle

PROUDMOORE
So there has been diplomatic
contact Youve spoken with them

JAINA
There’s been some progress Perhaps
we could discuss it later over
dinner

PROUDMOORE
Id like nothing more

Jaina’s eyes linger on LoGosh for an extra moment before she
turns and walks away He watches her go intrigued

BUTTONWILLOW
Gentlemen Welcome to Theramore
Im Counselor Buttonwillow senior

INT THERAMORE KEEP - JAINA’S CHAMBERS - EVENING

Dimly lit by flickering candlelight Tables cluttered with
ARCANE SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS AND ANCIENT BOOKS OF MAGIC

Proudmoore and Lo’Gosh take in the room as Jaina looks on
Proudmoore picks up a book examines the spine

PROUDMOORE
You kept up your studies

JAINA
Are you so surprised

PROUDMOORE
When you were a child it seemed
that each week you had a new hobby
Id always assumed magic was just
another of your passing fancies

Proudmoore turns his attention to a PORTRAIT on the wall A
WHITE-HAIRED HUMAN FEMALE in majestic robes that seem to
glimmer with magical energy Holding an ornate staff as she
stands in a regal pose Clearly a person of great import

PROUDMOORE
And you still paint I see Your
brushwork’s improved Who is this

JAINA
Archmage Aegwynn Last of the
Guardians of Tirisfal Charged with
defending Azeroth against the
agents of the Burning Legion Like
all the guardians before her her
identity kept a closely-guarded
secret until the day she died

PROUDMOORE
(a dismissive smile)
I see you’ve lost none of your
childhood fondness for bedtime
stories either

JAINA
Father magic is not a hobby And
theyre not bedtime stories They-

Shes cut short by the sound of a THROAT BEING CLEARED Turns
to see BUTTONWILLOW standing in the entryway

BUTTONWILLOW
Forgive me for interrupting my
lady Dinner is served

A pair of THERAMORE PAGES bring food to the dining table As
Proudmoore and LoGosh are seated there’s a brief moment of
unspoken tension between Jaina and Buttonwillow

JAINA
Thank you counselor That will be
all

Buttonwillow holds Jaina’s gaze for a moment longer -
scowling at her disapprovingly - before she bows and exits

Jaina sits with Proudmoore and Lo’Gosh
PROUDMOORE
This all looks wonderful Jaina
Thank you

Proudmoore looks to Lo’Gosh
LO’GOSH
Yes thank you

The civility of this situation is totally alien
He watches as Proudmoore and Jaina unfold their
does as they do mimicking He watches Jaina as
knife and fork and cuts into her roast chicken

LO’ GOSH
Why do you need a knife It’s
already dead

PROUDMOORE
Just eat

to LoGosh
napkins and
she takes her

LoGosh picks up his own knife and fork But the utensils are
foreign and unwieldy to him He gives up and tears into the

chicken with his bare hands Jaina watches him

PROUDMOORE
So Jaina tell us of this
progress youve made with the Orcs

JAINA
Weve been communicating through
messengers It’s not easy with the
language barrier but we’ve begun
negotiating a territorial border to
prevent any more skirmishes

PROUDMOORE
Thats it No direct contact No
agreement on anything

JAINA
We have generations of hatred and
mistrust to overcome And our
cultural differences are vast
Peace isn’t going to happen
overnight But I’m hopeful Their
leader Thrall isn’t like any of
the old tribal chieftains

PROUDMOORE
How much do you know about him

JAINA
Hes highly respected by his
people The Orcs have always been a
divided race but Thrall’s achieved
something no leader before him ever
could He united the clans brought
them together under one banner
Hes created a nation

amused

PROUDMOORE
Thats what worries me In the old
wars fighting a divided enemy
worked to our advantage But as a
single unified force they could
be a far more dangerous adversary

JAINA
I still believe they needn’t be an
adversary at all

PROUDMOORE
What about the patrol they
ambushed the men they killed

JAINA
That was no ambush The patrol got
lost in a storm and wandered into
an Orcish village The Ores thought
it was a raid and defended
themselves Thrall’s acknowledged
that it was all a mistake

PROUDMOORE
Is that what Im supposed to tell
their families It was a mistake

JAINA
Simply by being here we’re
encroaching upon Orcish land and by
their custom that is a grave
affront Thrall has built a city to
the north that rivals Stormwind -
with their numbers they could crush
us easily But they havent
Instead they’re talking to us
Surely that means something

Lo’Gosh who has been quietly devouring his roast chicken
gives an amused snort that gets their attention

JAINA
Is there something youd like to
contribute

Lo’Gosh drops the chicken carcass to his plate licks the
grease from his fingers

LO’ GOSH
Humans are so arrogant Assuming
that other races could be more like
you if only given the chance

(beat) (MORE)

LOGOSH (CONTD)
In all my years among Orcs I never
met one who even understood peace
much less desired it They’re a
warrior race it’s in their blood
To think you can change that is the
kind of naivety that separates
predator and prey

Jaina looks hard at Lo’Gosh scrutinizing him

JAINA
I knew your name was familiar
Youre the one who was raised by
Ores Who fights in the arenas

PROUDMOORE
He understands how Orcs think
better than any of us Youd do
well to listen to him

Lo’Gosh looks Jaina in the eye

LOGOSH
Youre right about Orcish custom
They consider their homeland
sacred And now you’re here
Building on their ancient lands
treading on the graves of their
ancestors If they havent attacked
yet it’s only because they’re
preparing one appropriate to the
scale of the insult you’ve caused

BEAT Proudmoore clearly troubled by this Lo’Gosh keeps his
gaze fixed on Jaina It unnerves her Theres something so
engaging and yet so dangerous about him

JAINA
I wont allow a belief in peace to
be dismissed as naivety King
Varian believed in peace He saw
his parents murdered and his city
burned by Ores and still he
believed Time and again he came
here to meet with the tribal
leaders in the hope of preventing
another war

PROUDMOORE
Yes he did And look what it got
him Murdered at sea by Orcs who
would do anything to destroy any
chance of peace
JAINA
It was never proved that Orcs were
responsible for that attack Thrall
himself has denied his people had
anything to do with it

Proudmoore sighs takes a sip of his wine

PROUDMOORE
Jaina the faith you’ve placed in
this Thrall is touching But you
should know we have quite a file on
him Interned at Durnholde with
other Orcish POWs after the Second
War he led a revolt in which he
and dozens of others escaped The
entire place put to the torch
guards slaughtered to the last man
The head of the commanding officer
impaled on a spike atop the keep’s
walls as it burned So you’1l
forgive me if I don’t share your
optimism about him

JAINA
If youre so skeptical what are
you doing here

PROUDMOORE

Six of our men are dead at Orcish
hands The first since the end of
the last war And I will not let
them be the first of a new one

(beat)
Therell be no more tip-toeing
around I want to look this Thrall
in the eye Then well see if
theres a real peace to be made
here You can arrange this

JAINA
I can try When

PROUDMOORE
Three days Once the rest of the
fleet has arrived

JAINA
The rest of the fleet

PROUDMOORE
For the protection of Theramore
should diplomacy fail

JAINA
Ive been trying to convince Thrall
that our intentions here are not
hostile The arrival here of even a
single warship is provocative
enough - what message do you think
an entire armada will send

PROUDMOORE
Exactly the message I wish to send -
that the Alliance is not to be
trifled with We must negotiate
from a position of strength

Jaina glowers at her father clearly not happy about this
BEAT and then Lo’Gosh BOLTS UP OUT OF HIS CHAIR Senses
suddenly on alert Aware of something beyond our perception

PROUDMOORE
What’s wrong

LOGOSH
Tauren

And now comes the sound of a CITY ALARM BELL being rung
EXT THERAMORE - CONTINUOUS

The main gate is raised and a PATROL of a dozen Theramore
soldiers crosses the bridge into town - bringing with them a
chain gang of TAUREN PRISONERS manacled in leg-irons

Theramore citizens watch as the Tauren are paraded through
the streets Jaina rushes from the town hall Proudmoore and
Lo’Gosh behind The crowd parts as she approaches

JAINA
Whos in command here

THERAMORE SCOUT
Ma‘am We were on patrol when we
found these Tauren lying in wait
near Swamplight Cove We assumed it
to be an ambush so we-

JAINA
Release them

THERAMORE SCOUT
Maam

JAINA
They werent trying to ambush you
Swamplight is Murloc territory

Jaina approaches one of the others - who is holding the
Tauren weapons mostly spears - and grabs a CRUDE NET

JAINA
This is for catching Murlocs They
were hunting for food Find someone
here who speaks Taurahe have them
apologize and then escort them back
to Swamplight Am I understood

Jaina can see the patrol leader feels sheepish She softens

JAINA
It’s all right You werent in
error Just see to their release

Suddenly one of the Tauren prisoners BREAKS FREE FROM HIS
CHAINS As the guards try to subdue him the other Tauren GO
WILD CHAOS BREAKS OUT as the Tauren charge like wild bulls
and several soldiers are SENT HURTLING THROUGH THE AIR

A wild Tauren CHARGES AT JAINA Lo’Gosh rushes forward and
SHOULDER-CHARGES the Tauren knocking them both to the
ground He and the Tauren GRAPPLE in the dirt The horned
beast bares its fangs and ROARS with a bestial rage

Lo’Gosh struggles to hold the Tauren at bay while grasping
for a FALLEN SWORD on the ground nearby Fingers clawing in
the dirt as the snarling Tauren tries to tear his throat out

Finally Lo’Gosh grasps the sword’s hilt and he DRIVES THE
BLADE CLEAN THROUGH THE TAUREN It slumps dead But as
Lo’Gosh gets to his feet ANOTHER TAUREN bears down on him
Wielding a MACE adorned with tribal markings Lo’Gosh
scrambles backward but is defenseless as the Tauren draws
back the maul to deliver a crushing downward blow

-jJust as it begins to GLOW The mace’s head LIQUEFYING INTO
MOLTEN STONE as the handle BLACKENS AND INCINERATES The
Tauren cries out and drops the burning weapon Astonished
Lo’Gosh looks up to see Jaina standing over him hand
outstretched - MAGICAL ENERGY crackling at her fingertips

As more guards rush into the fray the remaining Tauren are
finally subdued and re-shackled But one young WOUNDED TAUREN
CHARGES PAST THE GUARDS making a break for freedom The
guards give chase but the Tauren drops onto all fours and
BREAKS INTO A GALLOP too fast for anyone to follow

The GUARDS manning the city gate rush to close it but too
late - the Tauren escapes over the bridge and disappears into
the darkness of the marshlands beyond

A group of ALLIANCE GUARDS surrounds Lo’Gosh swords drawn

ALLIANCE GUARD
Drop the weapon Do it now

Lo’Gosh lets the sword slip from his fingers into the dirt
As the guards haul him to his feet Proudmoore steps in

PROUDMOORE
Stand down

They step back Proudmoore gives Lo’Gosh a grateful nod

PROUDMOORE
You saved my daughter Thank you

INT THERAMORE KEEP — JAINA’S CHAMBERS - NIGHT
Jaina enters the empty room Pours a glass of water

BUTTONWILLOW (0S)
Just couldn’t resist could you

Jaina looks up to see Buttonwillow standing nearby
Strangely not by the door but on the far side of the room
It’s not clear exactly how she entered without us noticing

JAINA
A man could have been killed Am I
to stand by and doing nothing

BUTTONWILLOW
When we entered into this
arrangement it was on condition
that it remain between us You have
a powerful gift - to reveal it
before you are ready is dangerous

JAINA
I know I’m sorry Forgive me

Buttonwillow sighs looks at Jaina sympathetically
BUTTONWILLOW
You should get some rest There
will be difficult days ahead

This strikes an ominous chord with Jaina

JAINA
What have you seen

Buttonwillow just looks back at her revealing nothing

BUTTONWILLOW
Get some rest

EXT DUSTWALLOW MARSH - DAY

The lights of Theramore Isle visible in the far distance We
follow the wounded Tauren as it gallops through the dark
overgrown marshlands racing away from Theramore

EXT THE BARRENS — DUSK

and across the vast desolate savannahs of The Barrens
EXT DUROTAR - NIGHT

and to the red-rock desert of Durotar The Tauren pauses
to catch its breath exhausted Winces as it clutches the
BLOODY WOUND in its side On it gallops into the night
CRANE UP to reveal the Tauren’s destination on the horizon
ORGRIMMAR The Orcish city is breathtakingly formidable
Easily Stormwind’s rival in terms of size and even more
heavily fortified Its high stone walls punctuated by
battlements and spiked wooden barricades BLOOD-RED BANNERS
ADORNED WITH ORCISH RUNES fly above tented rooftops

An ORC GUARD stationed in a perimeter watchtower spots the
approaching Tauren Blows on an oversized ALARM HORN

Orgrimmar’s huge gates of iron and oak open with a deep
rumble Closing again as soon as the Tauren is inside

INT ORGRIMMAR - MAIN GATE - CONTINUOUS

A group of ORC GUARDS rush to the wounded Tauren who finally
collapses exhausted at the feet of the SERGEANT-AT-ARMS

ORC SERGEANT-AT-ARMS
Find Cairne Quickly

INT ORGRIMMAR -— TENTED CHAMBER - NIGHT

The wounded Tauren lies in a bed Feverish barely conscious
His wound has been cleaned and dressed A FEMALE TAUREN
PRIESTESS says a prayer over him in the Taurahe language

CAIRNE BLOODHOOF enters A tall powerfully-built Tauren
there is a wise and dignified air to him The Priestess bows

CAIRNE
How is he

TAUREN PRIESTESS
All that can be done has been done
But I fear it will not be enough

CAIRNE
Leave us

The priestess leaves Cairne sits at the bedside

CAIRNE
Can you hear me my brother

Slowly the Tauren’s eyes open focusing and then open
wide when he realizes who is sitting at his bedside He tries
to sit up but Cairne gently restrains him

CAIRNE
Rest Save your strength You‘ve
traveled far From Mulgore

WOUNDED TAUREN
From Theramore the Humans
captured me But I escaped them
Had to tell you

The Tauren’s voice grows weaker now barely a whisper But
Cairne can sense the urgency He leans in close

CAIRNE
Tell me what

EXT ORGRIMMAR - WINDING STREET - NIGHT

A pair of ORC OFFICERS wait outside the building Cairne
emerges from inside a grave expression on his face

CAIRNE
Convene the council immediately

ORC OFFICER
At this hour

CAIRNE
Do it Wake Thrall if you have to

Cairne strides down the road into the night The two Ore
Officers look at each other

ORC OFFICER
Well I’m not waking him

INT ORGRIMMAR HORDE COUNCIL CHAMBER - NIGHT

A great circular forum lit by blazing torches and adorned
with ritualistic tapestries Tiered seating rises to the
ceiling looking down upon a central dirt-covered floor The
place is packed to the rafters with SENIOR ORCS AND TAUREN
currently engaged in a loud and unruly debate
43

Cairne stands in the center of the chamber along with
GROMMASH a powerful Orc dressed in battle regalia jawline
adorned with ELABORATE RUNIC TATTOOS Permanent warpaint

CAIRNE
Brothers please Let us have calm

GROMMASH
The time for discussion is over
Every moment we squander in debate
the Alliance musters its forces We
must hit them before they hit us

The assembled Orcs shake their fists and ROAR IN APPROVAL

ORC VOICE (0S)
This council will come to order

All voices are silenced as THRALL enters the chamber An Orc
of mighty physical stature dressed in regal armor and robes
and NATIVE JEWELRY - necklaces of feathers and ancient runic
totems He carries with him a MIGHTY HAMMER that stands as
tall as he does its head carved with shamanistic markings

Everybody genuflects in reverence as Thrall approaches

GROMMASH
Warchief

THRALL
What is it that could provoke such
heated debate at so late an hour

CAIRNE
An Alliance warship has landed in
Theramore Laden with troops and
armor

THRALL
How do we know of this

CAIRNE
A group of Tauren was captured by
Alliance troops One escaped He
saw the ship with his own eyes

GROMMASH
And not just any ship The Grand
Admiral’s flagship - the spearhead
of the Alliance fleet The rest
will not be far behind

(to the crowd)

I warned of this

(MORE)
44

GROMMASH (CONTD)
The Humans have always been a race
of deceivers and here now is the
proof They speak of peace - while
secretly preparing for war

The Orcs ROAR LOUDLY AGAIN

THRALL
There will be silence here

Thrall bellows loudly - and at the sound of his booming voice
THE ENTIRE CHAMBER SEEMS TO QUAKE A LITTLE A hint that
Thralls power may extend beyond just his physical strength

Everybody is silenced Thrall’s authority is absolute

THRALL
What is your recommendation

GROMMASH
Full pre-emptive attack My army is
ready We must crush them before
the rest of their forces arrive

Thrall looks to Cairne for his opinion

CAIRNE
I don’t know why this ship is here
But I know this - if we attack
Theramore the Alliance will
retaliate perhaps with a full
invasion of Kalimdor Wed be
plunged back into open war

GROMMASH
I assure you invasion is already
their plan and Theramore the
staging ground Why else would they
establish a foothold here

BEAT as Thrall considers weighing the conflicting advice

THRALL
There will be no attack Not yet

The council murmurs Grommash steps forward confrontational

GROMMASH
The very presence of these Humans
insults us We should have wiped
them out when they first came Now
their true intentions are made
plain and still you would have us
do nothing

(MORE)

GROMMASH (CONTD)
(closer)
Perhaps you have spent too much
time among Humans perhaps you
are still their slave

A hushed silence from the assembled Orcs The Warchief is
rarely challenged like this But Thrall remains clam

THRALL
If you wish to challenge my
authority Grommash you know the
rules of this council But remember
- all challenges are to the death

Thrall glares at Grommash His gaze fearsome withering
Finally Grommash backs down his head bowed Thrall looks up
at the council seats surrounding the chamber

THRALL
If anyone else here believes they
are better able to lead this nation
than I let them be heard now

A silent BEAT Thrall turns back to Grommash all business

THRALL
Ready the army March units into
the Barrens and deploy them along
the border And make sure the
Alliance sees it I want them to
know we’re ready for them
(beat)
This council is adjourned

He turns and sweeps out of the room Cairne watches him go
He appears troubled And he can see Thrall does too

EXT DUROTAR CLIFFS - NIGHT

Jagged cliffs overlook the Great Sea Thrall crouches at the
edge gazing out at the starlit night Deep in contemplation
There is only the sound of the waves on the beach below

CAIRNE (0S)
I thought I might find you here

REVEAL CAIRNE standing behind Thrall

THRALL
Grommash was right about the
Alliance fleet More ships are
crossing the sea coming here I
can sense them on the wind

CAIRNE
You think they really mean to
invade What of the peace talks

THRALL
Perhaps peace was possible once a
long time ago But now

CAIRNE
If it comes to war you know the
Tauren will stand with you But the
Alliance has never been stronger
Can we really prevail

Thrall stands Looks back at the lights of Orgrimmar on the
hilltop behind them

THRALL
I will not let anything threaten
all that we have built here If the
Alliance wants a war then I will
see that they get one The like of
which they have never seen

Thrall picks up his mighty war hammer and starts heading down
a rocky path that leads from the cliffs to the beach below

CAIRNE
Where are you going

THRALL
To tip the odds back in our favor

EXT DUROTAR - BLADEFIST BAY - NIGHT

Desolate beach stretches in both directions The Durotar
cliffs looming behind him Thrall stands at the water’s edge
looking out to sea the tides lapping around his feet

He sinks to one knee holding his giant hammer before him
And begins CHANTING IN ORCISH An ancient prayer He repeats
the mantra over and over growing ever louder and with
each recitation the INCOMING TIDES GROW IN STRENGTH

The sea - mirror-calm just moments ago - is BEGINNING TO
CHURN A STORM BREWING Growing angrier and angrier

As the sea churns more violently and the white-foamed waves
CRASH OVER THRALL he raises his hammer overhead and with
one mighty swing POUNDS IT INTO THE RAGING WATER And a
POWERFUL RIPPLE radiates out from the impact point growing
larger as it moves out to sea becoming a RISING WAVE

EXT THE GREAT SEA - NIGHT

Moonlit and calm A FLEET OF ALLIANCE WARSHIPS ploughs its
way across the sea The lead ship is the RSS DEFIANT

Stormpike stands near the bow looking out to sea A YOUNG
ALLIANCE PRIVATE brings him a mug of hot tea

STORMPIKE
Thank you lad Cold as a witchs
tit out here tonight

ALLIANCE PRIVATE
That it is sir

Stormpike looks at the private Barely out of his teens

STORMPIKE
Whats your name private

JENKINS
Jenkins sir

STORMPIKE
Ever been in battle Jenkins

JENSEN
No sir I tried to sign up for the
last campaign but they said I was
too young Wouldn’t let me fight

There is an eager look to Jenkins The kind of eagerness one
only finds in a soldier who hasnt yet seen battle Stormpike
looks out across the sea to the moonlit horizon

STORMPIKE
Don’t be too disappointed son I
fear you may get your chance yet

And then SOMETHING HAPPENS A gust of wind A slight shifting
of the boat Barely noticeable But Stormpike senses it

STORMPIKE
Did you feel that

JENKINS
Feel what sir

Stormpike can’t put his finger on it but it’s troubling He
steps up to the bow - and SPOTS SOMETHING in the distance

A GIANT WAVE ON THE HORIZON COMING RIGHT AT THEM

STORMPIKE
Titans preserve us

A HURRICANE-FORCE WIND RUSHES OVER THEM buffeting the ship
violently Jenkins is KNOCKED OFF HIS FEET Stormpike’s mug
SHATTERS ON THE GROUND He stumbles across the listing deck
and SOUNDS THE WARNING BELL

STORMPIKE
All hands general quarters

The ship BURSTS TO LIFE crewmen emerging from below decks in
response Some see the approaching wave and stop paralyzed

STORMPIKE
Hard to port Hard to port

The HELMSMAN (BISLEY) spins the wheel hard over But the wave
is so vast there is no avoiding it It CRASHES OVER THEM the
force of its impact almost overturning the ship - suddenly at
the center of a POWERFUL STORM

Stormpike makes his way to the helmsman as the ship is tossed
by the churning waters SHOUTING over the deafening gale

STORMPIKE
Why didn’t we see this coming

HELMSMAN BISLEY
Don’t know sir Bloody thing came
out of nowhere

STORMPIKE
Can we get through it

HELMSMAN BISLEY
Storm’s too strong could lose half
the fleet trying Weve got to
change course

Bisley unfolds a CHART and points to the GIGANTIC WHIRLPOOL
in the center of the Great Sea between the two continents

HELMSMAN BISLEY
South’ll take us right into the
Maelstrom Only choice is north

Stormpike notices that the northerly course heads into an
INCOMPLETE SECTION of the chart

STORMPIKE
That takes us off the map
49

HELMSMAN BISLEY
Got to do something sir We wont
last long in this weather

BEAT as Stormpike makes a command decision

STORMPIKE
Due north it is

INT ORGRIMMAR - GROMMASH’S QUARTERS - NIGHT

The walls lined with animal skins armor and weapons
Grommash sits in the firelight rocking back and forth He
seems greatly troubled Feverish Muttering to himself

GROMMASH
Qut get out I do not hear
you Ido not hear you

He hears someone approach Quickly stands to see Thrall
standing in the doorway Lit by the flickering firelight

GROMMASH
Warchief Your presence honors me

Thrall enters the room eyes locked on Grommash

THRALL
You show me respect here but not
in the council chamber

GROMMASH
I said only what many of the
chieftains want to hear There are
those who feel we have tolerated
these Humans long enough

THRALL

And they may be right But I will
decide when that time has come

(beat closer)
You know how difficult it was to
unite the clans This is still a
young nation still fragile Open
dissent now could tear it apart
The Humans’ strength has always
lied in their unity Thats how
they defeated us before If we are
to confront them again now we must
have that same unity

GROMMASH
Perhaps the idea of emulating
Humans appeals to you

(MORE)

GROMMASH (CONTD)
But Id rather die fighting than
live like them Without honor

Thrall notices that Grommash appears agitated on edge

THRALL
Grom does something trouble you

Grommash looks away unwilling to engage Hiding something

THRALL
Look me in the eye

Grommash won’t do it turns away Thrall steps forward and
GRABS GROMMASH BY THE SHOULDERS

THRALL
Look mein the eye

Thrall looks deep into Grommash’s eyes As though searching
for something Only when he is satisfied does he release him

THRALL
You have the heart of a giant
Grom And I look on you as a
brother But if you dare challenge
me in open council again it will
be the last time Am I understood

GROMMASH
Yes Warchief

Thrall heads toward the door
GROMMASH
Thrall Whatever happens we will
always be brothers
BEAT And then Thrall leaves without another word
EXT THERAMORE ISLE - HARBOR - DAY

Buzzing with the newly-arrived Alliance troops Proudmoore
stands on the dock looking out to sea as Lo’Gosh approaches

PROUDMOORE
The rest of the fleet should have
arrived by now Where are they

BEAT as the two of them look out across the sea Pensive

LO’ GOSH
I was speaking with one of the

locals earlier
(MORE)

LO’GOSH (CONTD)
This Ore nation to the north it’s
called Durotar Does that name
sound familiar to you

PROUDMOORE
Should it

LOGOSH
Durotan is a giant in Orcish
history First Warchief of the
Frostwolf clan When I lived among
the Orcs I’d hear his name often
Usually invoked as a battle cry

The name sends a chill down Proudmoore’s spine

PROUDMOORE
Frostwolf I remember fighting
them In the Second War They were
the last to surrender They dug in
at Alterac Valley for a year after
the war ended we lost an entire
legion in finally breaking them

LO’GOSH
I once fought a Frostwolf Ore in
the arena He had a bloodlust in
him Id never seen in another

BEAT as Proudmoore reflects grimly on this

PROUDMOORE
So Thrall has named this new
nation for one of his peoples most
barbarous warriors what are we
do deduce from that

ALLIANCE SOLDIER (0S)
Admiral

They turn to find an ALLIANCE SOLDIER rushing toward them

PROUDMOORE
Slow down man Catch your breath

ALLIANCE SOLDIER
Our patrol has returned Theyve
sighted Orcish heavy infantry
massing along the border

Proudmoore and Lo’Gosh exchange an ominous look

LO‘GOSH
I think you have your answer

EXT THE GREAT SEA - NIGHT

The storm is finally abating The Alliance armada emerges
from choppy seas into calmer waters On the deck of the
Defiant Stormpike approaches the heln

STORMPIKE
Mister Bisley Report

HELMSMAN BISLEY
I think we’re through the worst of
it sir Clear skies ahead

STORMPIKE
Good work Now the only question
is where the hell are we

INT ORGRIMMAR - HORDE COUNCIL CHAMBER - NIGHT

Thrall sits upon his throne an ALLIANCE SCROLL in his hand
Deep in thought Cairne and Grommash stand before him

GROMMASH
Its a trick What else can it be

THRALL
This message carries the seal of
the Grand Admiral himself

GROMMASH
A deception They see us preparing
for battle and seek to delay us
The Humans did not bring a shipload
of diplomats to our shores - they
came armed for war

A long BEAT as Thrall considers this He stands

THRALL
I will meet with him
GROMMASH
Warchief-
THRALL

Under my conditions I want to look
this Human in the eye If he is
lying I will know And we will
settle this One way or the other

EXT DUSTWALLOW MARSH - DAWN

As dawn breaks over the treetops we catch a silhouette of a
GIANT BIRD flying at us out of the rising sun

CLOSER ON THE BIRD - it’s a GRYPHON a majestic winged
creature with the head of an eagle and the body of a lion An
ALLIANCE MESSENGER rides on its saddled back as it beats its
great wings headed toward THERAMORE ISLE on the horizon

EXT THERAMORE ISLE - GRYPHON ROOST - MORNING

The gryphon comes in for a landing at Theramore’s gryphon
roost where more of the winged creatures nest in straw-laden
berths Theramore’s GRYPHON MASTER takes the reins of the
beast as the messenger leaps from the saddle and rushes
toward the town hall a SCROLL clutched in his hand

INT THERAMORE KEEP — JAINA’S CHAMBERS - DAY

Jaina Lo’Gosh and Proudmoore stand around a table upon which
has been unrolled the messenger’s scroll - written in ORCISH

PROUDMOORE
What kind of conditions

JAINA
He agrees to meet only at a neutral
location He proposes a site in the
Barrens halfway between here and
Orgrimmar He will come alone No
guards We must to do the same

Proudmoore doesnt like this He looks at Lo’Gosh

PROUDMOORE
What do you think

LO’GOSH
I know the Barrens It’s open
ground flat desolate no way
they could ambush you there

PROUDMOORE
You think we should trust him

Lo‘Gosh glances at Jaina
LO’GOSH
I think you should trust that your
daughter knows what she’s doing

Jaina looks back at Lo’Gosh surprised And for the first
time there is a glimmer of a smile in his direction

PROUDMOORE
When

JAINA
Tomorrow At dawn

Proudmoore mulls it over

PROUDMOORE
Tomorrow at dawn it is

JAINA
Ill make the arrangements

Jaina turns and exits leaving Proudmoore and Lo’Gosh alone

PROUDMOORE

I dont like it Id intended to
have this negotiation with the
Alliance fleet at our back Without
it what leverage do we have

(pacing worried)
Thrall is preparing for war as we
speak And by all accounts he is a
formidable General If we cannot
turn back the tide at this meeting
Theramore is lost And with it all
of Kalimdor

A grim BEAT And then a thought occurs to Lo’Gosh

LO’GOSH
There may still be another way To
regain your advantage

Off Proudmoore’s intrigued look
EXT THE GREAT SEA - NIGHT

The waters now entirely calm Stormpike and SECOND OFFICER
GAINES study a sextant from the Defiant’s deck

SECOND OFFICER GAINES
This doesn’t make any sense sir I
can’t get a fix on our position I
dont even recognize the stars

STORMPIKE
You have no idea where we are

SECOND OFFICER GAINES
No sir And that’s not even the
strangest part of it Sunrise was
supposed to be two hours ago But
there’s no bloody sign of it I
think that storm blew us farther
off course than we first thought

CROW’S NEST (0S)
Land ho

They rush to the bow to see a GREAT LAND MASS extending
across the horizon DIM LIGHTS FLICKERING along the shore

STORMPIKE
I see lights Some kind of town

SECOND OFFICER GAINES
Whatever it is it’s not on any
Alliance map

BEAT as Stormpike thinks This feels a little ominous

STORMPIKE
Take us in

INT THERAMORE KEEP - LO’GOSH’S QUARTERS - NIGHT

Lo’Gosh sits at a table crushing exotic WILD FLOWERS with a
mortar and pestle He adds the powder to a DARK LIQUID from a
small bottle mixing it to form a THICK PASTE

JAINA (0S)
They tell me youre dangerous

Lo’Gosh looks up to see Jaina standing in the doorway He
stands covering the mixture with a cloth

JAINA
Should I be afraid of you

Lo’Gosh just stands there mute

JAINA
Well I’11 take my chances

She glides gracefully into the room

JAINA
I wanted to thank you For helping
my father agree to Thrall’s
conditions I admit I was surprised
after everything I’d heard

LO’ GOSH
And what is that

JAINA
That you’re a barbarian That you
have more in common with the Orcs
than with us But you’re not at all
what I’d expected of you

LOGOSH
Where I come from whats expected
of me is simple Here everything’s
more complicated Im trying to
adapt

Jaina smiles politely as she hovers nearby the empty chair at
LoGosh’s table Clearly waiting for an invitation to sit

LO’GOSH
Uh sit if you want to

They both sit It’s all a little stilted and awkward Lo’Gosh
again fumbling his way through polite Human interaction

JAINA
I can tell my father trusts you
Youve done well to earn his favor
Hes always been very sparing with
it Even with me

LO’ GOSH
The two of you arent close

JAINA
I think he would have preferred
another son My two brothers they
were always his favorites And they
idolized him As soon they were old
enough they followed him into the
military All they ever wanted was
to be just like him

Lo’Gosh can sense a sadness in Jaina as she tells the tale

LO’ GOSH
What happened to them

JAINA
Derek was killed in the First War
Tandred in the Second I remember
after we buried Tandred alongside
his brother something in my father
changed He said he never again
wanted to see another family suffer
the kind of loss ours had

Tears welling up She fights them back composes herself

JAINA
Weve had our differences over the
years but I believe he sincerely

wants peace
(MORE)
JAINA (CONTD)
As his advisor I thought it was
important that you know that

LO’GOSH
What makes you think I care

BEAT The response throws Jaina a little

JAINA
How can you not A lasting peace is
something weve never had We could
be on the verge of history here

LO’GOSH
I didnt come here to make history
I came here to earn my freedom
nothing more

JAINA
What use will your freedom be if
the world is consumed by war

LO’GOSH
I doubt Id have much difficulty
adjusting

She just looks at him dumbfounded

LO’GOSH
Theres a reason youve never had
peace Because it’s a fantasy It’s
our nature to destroy each other
And that will never change

JAINA
Have you always been such a cynic

LO’GOSH
(shrugs)
I am what the world made me

JAINA
You mean what the arena made you
Youre part of a larger world now
A world where anything is
possible yes even peace

LO’GOSH
Believe whatever you want Your
fate will unfold just the same

BEAT Jaina stands looks at him with contempt

JAINA
Maybe they were right about you
Maybe you are just a barbarian

Lo’Gosh stands and steps closer leoking into her eyes

LO’GOSH
Maybe I am

The way hes looking at Jaina unnerves her but in a way she
finds utterly disarming A palpable sexual electricity
between them A white-hot BEAT - and then Lo’Gosh turns away

JAINA
What’s wrong

LO’ GOSH
I’m not accustomed to the company
of Human women Your scent is
distracting

JAINA
I’m not wearing any scent

LO’GOSH
You don’t have to be
(beat)
You should go

Still a little flustered by their close encounter Jaina
composes herself and make for the door

LO’GOSH
Jaina

She turns back He looks at her with sincerity

LO’GOSH
It doesn’t matter what I believe
Your father came here to avoid a
war And I’m going to help him
Thats the price of my freedom

She nods understanding Then turns and leaves Lo’Gosh goes
back to his table removes the cloth that was hiding the
strange paste he’d been making He stares at it troubled

EXT THE GREAT SEA - TWILIGHT
The Alliance fleet sails toward the mysterious mist-shrouded

coastline The sky is lighter now - but still no sign of sun
As though this world exists in a state of PERMANENT TWILIGHT

The MOON hangs high in the sky casting everything in its
ethereal pale blue aura It seems bigger closer than usual

Stormpike stands at the Defiant’s bow looking toward the
coast as it approaches out of the mist Close enough now to
see the DESERTED TOWN that sprawls across the coastline

SECOND OFFICER GAINES
I dont like this sir

STORMPIKE
Nor I Mister Gaines

Stormpike notices a DOCK extending from the shore

STORMPIKE
Bring us into port Have the other
ships hold position off-shore

EXT DARKSHORE - DOCK - TWILIGHT

The Defiant is piloted into harbor CREWMEN disembark and tie
the ship to the docks moorings Stormpike disembarks along
with a DOZEN ARMED SOLDIERS He leads them toward town

EXT DARKSHORE - AUBERDINE - TWILIGHT

Auberdine is shrouded in a LEAFY GLADE with a DARK DENSE
FOREST beyond Its architecture is stunning - every building
made of ELEGANTLY CARVED WOOD as though each one rose
directly from the earth itself

Stormpike and his men move in It’s a ghost town completely
abandoned Suddenly a RUSTLING IN THE TREES Everyone turns
toward the forest Nothing but darkness beyond

SECOND OFFICER GAINES
Was that just the wind

STORMPIRKE
Lets find out

Stormpike draws his sword and leads his men toward the trees
EXT DARKSHORE - FOREST - CONTINUOUS
Stormpike and his men move along a narrow path that winds
through the darkened forest There’s a STRANGE SOUND all
around us It sounds almost like breathing

SECOND OFFICER GAINES

If I didn’t know better I’d swear
this whole damn forest was alive

STORMPIKE
It’s just your imagination Mister
Gaines Keep your wits about you

But Stormpike senses it too And as his party moves deeper
inside the forest a LARGE TREE they pass seems to MOVE WITH
THEM — CREAKING QUIETLY as it moves FOLLOWING THEM

EXT DARKSHORE - FOREST CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

Stormpike’s party emerges into a LEAF-STREWN CLEARING Empty
and tranquil Surrounded on all sides by the dense treeline
Everybody freezes when they hear a LOW ANIMALISTIC GROWL
from the trees up ahead Bestial and terrifying

STORMPIKE
That wasn’t the wind

Something up ahead is COMING THROUGH THE TREES The GROWLING
continues as it paces steadily toward them Stormpike’s men
stand ready their sword hands trembling

A GREAT BEAR emerges into the clearing Colored in such a way
that the creature appears to sport ARCANE RUNES on its fur
It stands before them emitting its low growl Salivating it
bares its fangs Eyes GLOWING PALE BLUE

STORMPIKE
Back away slowly No sudden moves

But as they back up they realize the forest has somehow
CLOSED AROUND THEM the path that led them here now blocked

The bear prowls closer Stormpike and his men are trapped
They raise their swords ready to fight if they have to

The bear stops just yards from them And then TRANSFORMS
its body morphing into a HUMANOID FORM Stormpike and the
others watch transfixed until the figure resolves into

A NIGHT ELF Female tall and athletic with orchid-colored
skin Fiercely glowing eyes and elongated ears that extend to
fine points Clad in leather armor dark hair cascading down
her back She is an awesome disarmingly beautiful sight

And then the forest COMES ALIVE Many of the trees UPROOT AND
TRANSFORM branches morphing into limbs as they become

MORE NIGHT ELVES Both male and female While some transmute
from other forms others seem simply to PHASE IN OUT OF THE
SHADOWS as though a MAGICAL CAMOUFLAGE has been lowered

The female Night Elf takes a step toward Stormpike

NIGHT ELF FEMALE
You and your men will disarm Now

STORMPIKE
(to his men)
Do it

Stormpikes men do as ordered Night Elves move in and sweep
the weapons away The female still eyes Stormpike warily

NIGHT ELF FEMALE
You‘re a Dwarf

STORMPIKE
My name’s Stormpike And you
youre a Night Elf

NIGHT ELF FEMALE
I am Thirza Why have you brought
warriors to our shores

STORMPIKE
We mean no harm We got lost ina
storm We were headed for Kalimdor
Our interests there are under
threat from the Orcs

THIRZA
Orcs

Thirza walks past him with a sense of urgency toward the
path leading back toward town which has now re-opened

THIRZA
Your men will return to your ship
You will come with me
EXT DARKSHORE - THE VEILED SEA - TWILIGHT
Thirza and Stormpike stand in a SMALL BOAT that glides across
the still moonlit waters As Darkshore’s coast disappears
behind them a VEIL OF FOG creeps in over the waters

STORMPIKE
Where are you taking me

THIRZA
To Teldrassil

STORMPIKE
Teldrassil

Thirza smiles proudly as she sees something up ahead

THIRZA
The Crown of the Earth The World
Tree

And now we see it too Coming at us out of the fog At first
it appears to be a massive mountain or cliffs edge but as
we push through the fog it is revealed as

A COLOSSAL TREE rising up out of the sea so massive its
width encompasses the ENTIRE HORIZON as it draws closer

Teldrassil is literally THOUSANDS OF METERS ACROSS Near
impossible to comprehend its full scale ENTIRE TOWNS AND
VILLAGES have been built into its heaving boughs The whole
tree is ALIVE WITH NIGHT ELF CIVILIZATION

Its highest boughs form a VAST ARBOREAL CRADLE within which
is nestled a utopian landscape of forests rivers
waterfalls lakes - and the great city of DARNASSUS

Stormpike gazes up at it in absolute awe Never in his life
has he seen anything even remotely like it

EXT TELDRASSIL - RUT‘THERAN VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

A SMALL VILLAGE is nestled between the winding roots at the
base of the great tree where it rises from the sea The boat
docks here and Thirza escorts Stormpike through the village

NIGHT ELF VILLAGERS look curiously at Stormpike as he passes
through a wooden arch that takes them INSIDE THE GREAT TREE

INT TELDRASSIL - CARVED HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

A winding hallway covered in moss and creeping roots Thirza
shows Stormpike onto a WOODEN PLATFORM that stands inside a
TALL SHAFT that extends up into darkness

THIRZA
Where we go now no Human or Dwarf
has ever set foot Step lightly
And hold onto something

Thirza throws a wooden lever and the platform ROCKETS UPWARD
at breakneck speed Stormpike holds on for dear life

EXT DARNASSUS - TWILIGHT

The platform comes to a halt arriving finally at
DARNASSUS The capital city at Teldrassil’s monumental peak
The architecture is surreal - as though Ancient Greece had

been designed by Salvador Dali The whole city is shrouded
within DENSE CANOPY FOREST

Thirza escorts Stormpike past ornate temples and breathtaking
statuary and up a grand marble stairway to a PALATIAL DOMED
ROTUNDA supported by columns of extraordinary beauty

EXT DARNASSUS - TEMPLE OF THE MOON - TWILIGHT

A VIBRANT GROVE grows within A WATERFALL cascading into a
WELL which shimmers with a powerful life-force The entire
temple is BATHED IN MOONLIGHT which shafts through an opening
in the domed ceiling At this altitude it feels like you
could reach up and pluck the moon right out of the sky

Stormpike is led by Thirza to an ALTAR directly beneath the
moon’s radiant glow There stands TYRANDE WHISPERWIND Her
costume and bearing suggest a woman of regal authority

Without turning Tyrande seems to sense their presence

TYRANDE
Thirza It would appear that you
have brought home a stray

THIRZA
Forgive me High Priestess An
Alliance fleet has landed here

She gazes up at the moonlight beaming down from above

TYRANDE
I know Elune sees everything

She turns to regard Stormpike with interest

TYRANDE
You are lost Far from home And
there is fear in you The
apprehension that only a warrior
feels before battle

STORMPIKE
My people on Kalimdor may face a
new war against the Orcs

As before the mention of Orcs unsettles the Night Elf
TYRANDE
We must seek Malfurion’s counsel
We must wake him from the Dream
EXT THE EMERALD DREAM
We are moving across a LUSH AND PRIMAL WILDERNESS - vaguely

reminiscent of Azeroth but untouched by civilization A
sprawling prehistoric landscape of unparalleled beauty

There is a SURREALISTIC DREAMLIKE QUALITY to this place
Everything feels somehow unreal Time is not a constant here
Everything is TINTED IN AN ETHEREAL GREENISH HUE

A TALL POWERFULLY-BUILT NIGHT ELF MALE strides through a
WHISPERING WHEATFIELD He sports a LONG GREEN BEARD and a
THICK MANE from which protrude GREAT HORNED ANTLERS Unlike
the other Night Elves we have seen his eyes glow with a
POWERFUL GOLDEN LIGHT His face painted with TRIBAL RUNES

He is MALFURION STORMRAGE And there is something majestic
about him a quiet aura of wisdom and righteousness

A GIANT GREEN-SKINNED DRAGON GLIDES OVERHEAD Beating its
huge wings with effortless grace as it sails across the sky
Malfurion looks up at it with great respect and smiles

But then something troubles him A DARK SHADOW creeping
across the land Seeming to TAINT AND CORRUPT everything it
touches Malfurion moves across the plain until he reaches a
GRASSY OUTCROPPING which looks out over a VAST OCEAN

STORM CLOUDS are brewing on the horizon Roiling with a dark
malevolence Malfurion furrows his brow greatly troubled

MALFURION
The gathering storm

There is an OMINOUS CRACK OF LIGHTNING and Malfurion’s vision
BURNS OUT WITH A BLINDING FLASH OF GREEN LIGHT

EXT DARNASSUS - CENARION ENCLAVE - TWILIGHT

and he awakens in a SPACIOUS REGAL CHAMBER carved into
the living wood of Teldrassil’s boughs Malfurion is
SUSPENDED IN A MYSTICAL GREEN AURA He opens his eyes to see
Thirza Tyrande and Stormpike bowed reverently before him

MALFURION
Why have I been awakened

His voice is so deep and resonant it raises the hairs on the
backs of our necks The voice of an impossibly ancient soul

TYRANDE
Honored teacher Forgive our
intrusion We humbly request your
wisdom and your guidance

The magical aura around Malfurion diminishes lowering him to
the ground He approaches Tyrande who remains bowed

MALFURION
Rise my beloved

Tyrande rises before Malfurion and the two become LOCKED IN
A PASSIONATE EMBRACE Their deep love for each other evident

INT DARNASSUS - TEMPLE GARDENS - TWILIGHT

Malfurion Tyrande Thirza and Stormpike walk the moonlit
gardens Darnassian citizens bow to Malfurion as he passes

MALFURION
Speak to me of these Orcs

STORMPIKE
A new Warchief has founded an
Orcish nation north of Theramore
Its borders expand by the day

MALFURION

Not long ago my own people had our
own encounter with the Orcs They
tore down our sacred groves at
Silverwing and converted them into
a lumber camp They showed no
respect for the earth offered no
tribute We fought many battles

(beat)
It saddens me to tell you this But
I fear that there will be no peace
There will be only blood Much more
blood before this is done A time
of great decision will soon be upon
you This much was revealed to me
within the Emerald Dream

STORMPIKE
How can you know all this

TYRANDE
Time is meaningless inside the
Dream The past present future -
all exist as one

STORMPIKE
My people believe that the future
is not set That our destinies are
what we make them

TYRANDE
How quaint

MALFURION
For ten thousand years I have been
guided by the Dream What I saw
there you will see for yourself
soon enough

A disquieting BEAT Malfurion appears thoughtful

MALFURION
We will provide you with a chart to
your destination And a detachment
of our best Sentinels will
accompany you there

STORMPIKE
The chart is appreciated But
military assistance will not be
necessary

Malfurion’s eyes burn with an ominous inner fire

MALFURION
Yes it will

EXT DARNASSUS - CENARION ENCLAVE - TWILIGHT

Later Malfurion gazes up at the moon contemplative Tyrande
approaches embraces him from behind He turns and smiles
lovingly at her but the smile is tempered by something else

TYRANDE
Shando something troubles you

MALFURION
I want you to go to Theramore with
the Alliance fleet You will
command our forces personally

TYRANDE
Why

MALFURION
I saw something else within the
Dream Something I have not seen in
Many ages
(beat)
I saw the mark of the Legion

The mere mention of the word horrifies Tyrande

TYRANDE
Are you sure

MALFURION
I could always sense Sargeras when
he drew near And I sense him now
His hand is in this twisting
events to his advantage from the
shadows Preparing the ground

(beat)
(MORE)

MALFURION (CONTD)
There is more to this crisis
between the Orcs and Humans than
they realize Much more That is
why you must go

TYRANDE
Why didn’t you warn them of this

MALFURION
No mortal race should know too much
about their own future

TYRANDE
If the Legion returns to Azeroth
they wont have a future

Malfurion looks back up at the moon his expression grave

MALFURION
Nor any of us

INT THERAMORE KEEP - JAINA’S CHAMBERS - PRE-DAWN

Jaina is making preparations to leave Buttonwillow watches
nearby She appears perturbed about something

BUTTONWILLOW
I have a bad feeling about this

JAINA
What’s wrong

BUTTONWILLOW
I don’t know But something is
afoot I’ve always had a keen nose
for treachery

JAINA

You’re beginning to sound like my
father If theres to be peace one
side has to be the first to trust
the other I have to believe that
Thrall wont betray us

beat)
I have to go Wish us luck

BUTTONWILLOW
Jaina that’s-

But it’s too late Jaina is already hurrying away

BUTTONWILLOW
-not what I meant

EXT THERAMORE ISLE - PRE-DAWN

Jaina mounts up alongside Lo’Gosh and Proudmoore They spur
their steeds and head out from Theramore into the marshlands
as Buttonwillow watches gravely from the spiretop window

EXT THE BARRENS — CROSSROADS - DAWN

The flat desolate landscape is bathed in the warm light of
the rising sun The Barrens is a dustbowl of dry sun-baked
clay almost featureless punctuated only by rocks and berms

TWO DUSTY UNPAVED ROADS meet out here Jaina Proudmoore and
LoGosh wait at the crossroads horses idling nearby

PROUDMOORE
He’s late

JAINA
Hell be here

PROUDMOORE
And if not What if he doesn’t
show

A LONG BEAT Then Lo’Gosh SNIFFS THE AIR

LO’ GOSH
No he’s coming

He looks out toward the horizon And then we see it too At
first just a hazy silhouette in the shimmering heat almost
like a mirage But becoming clearer as it approaches

THRALL Riding in on a SNARLING OVERSIZED WOLF MOUNT In
FULL ARMORED REGALIA his great hammer slung across his back

Proudmoore watches apprehensively as Thrall dismounts just
yards away Even Jaina looks nervous Moment of truth

PROUDMOORE
Ive never been this close to one
before Outside of battle

Thrall approaches As the Humans go to meet him

PROUDMOORE
(aside to Jaina)
Let me do the talking

Proudmoore never takes his eyes off Thrall as the two leaders
come finally face to face A tense BEAT as they size each
other up If there were tumbleweeds in the Barrens one would
blow across the screen right about now

PROUDMOORE
Warchief Thrall I’m Grand Admiral
Proudmoore of the Alliance

Proudmoore glances back at Lo’Gosh who clears his throat and
translates the greeting into perfect Orcish

PROUDMOORE
This is my daughter Jaina
magistrate of Theramore

Jaina speaks in practiced but stilted Orcish

JAINA
(subtitled)
Its an honor to finally meet you

But Thrall seems less interested in either of them than he is
with Lo’Gosh All his attention is directed at him

THRALL
Who is this

LO’GOSH
Im the interpreter

Thrall scrutinizes him closely As though there is more to
this Human than meets the eye something he can’t quite put
his finger on He leans in close and SMELLS HIM Lo’Gosh
doesnt flinch familiar with the custom

PROUDMOORE
In the spirit of goodwill between
our two peoples I present you with
this

LoGosh translates as Proudmoore produces a SMALL CLOTH
PACKAGE wrapped in twine offers it to Thrall Thrall regards
the package warily before reaching out and taking it

He unwraps it to reveal a DAGGER The blade has been SNAPPED
OFF at the mid-point Thrall regards it curiously

- PROUDMOORE
A symbol of peace

Thrall takes the knife in his hand to examine it The broken
blade glimmering in the sun as he turns it

He furrows his brow There’s something wrong about the knife
The handle has been coated with a DARK STICKY SUBSTANCE It
stains Thrall’s fingers like wet paint It’s the SAME PASTE
we saw Lo’Gosh making earlier

THRALL
What is this

He smells the residue on his fingertips His eyes widen in
alarm nostrils flaring as he realizes what it is

THRALL
Swift-thistle I am betrayed

Thrall stumbles backward drowsily as the effects of the drug
take hold The dagger slips from his hand into the dirt

PROUDMOORE
Now

Suddenly the landscape around us seems to COME ALIVE A TEAM
OF ALLIANCE COMMANDOS throws off the DESERT CAMOUFLAGE
concealing them as they rise from pits dug in the earth

The Alliance commandos RAISE CROSSBOWS level them at Thrall
The arrowheads glisten coated with more of Lo’Gosh’s drug

JAINA
Not

Jaina rushes toward Thrall but Proudmoore restrains her as
the Alliance archers OPEN FIRE Thrall ROARS IN PAIN as the
crossbow bolts strike him He slumps to one knee the poison
weakening him further The Alliance commandos close in

Thralls wolf snarls angrily and POUNCES TO HIS DEFENSE
MAULING an Alliance commando before it is SHOT WITH ARROWS
and goes down The commandos surround the weakened Thrall

Thralls strength is ebbing away The Alliance troops prepare
nets and ropes It would appear to be over but then
Thrall’s eyes FLICKER OPEN Defiance coursing through him

He begins to CHANT IN ORCISH a prayer similar to the one we
heard on the beach THE WIND RISES kicking up dust And then
the EARTH ITSELF BEGINS TO SHAKE The Alliance commandos look
around anxiously as the ground trembles beneath them

With a mighty warcry Thrall SURGES BACK TO HIS FEET throwing
off the Alliance forces He grabs his hammer and SMASHES IT
INTO THE EARTH creating a DEEP RIFT that snakes across the
ground Several Alliance soldiers PLUMMET INTO THE FISSURE

Proudmoore and Jaina are KNOCKED OFF THEIR FEET by the
quaking earth beneath them Jaina HITS HER HEAD AGAINST A
ROCK as she falls knocking her out cold

The other soldiers rush again at Thrall He knocks several
away with a SWEEPING BLOW of his hammer

The WIND HOWLS growing ever stronger Whipping up DUST
DEVILS that whirl aggressively around Thrall PROTECTING HIM
As the Alliance troops try to approach Thrall they are
CAUGHT UP IN THE WHIRLWINDS and sent spinning into the air

Dazed looks around to see Jaina lying unconscious nearby
Head bleeding He scrambles frantically to her side

PROUDMOORE
Jaina Jaina

She doesn’t respond Furious Proudmoore draws his sword and
rushes at Thrall who sees him coming and KNOCKS HIM OFF HIS
FEET with a swipe of his hammer As Proudmoore crawls away

Thrall bears down on him his fury rising poised to strike

Suddenly LOGOSH APPEARS BEHIND THRALL Leaping onto his back
and PLUNGING A FISTFUL OF POISONED ARROWS into his shoulder

Thrall CRIES OUT and slumps to the ground Struggling to his
last breath but slipping finally into unconsciousness And at
last the elemental forces subside dust settling around them

Proudmoore hauls himself to his feet brushes himself off

PROUDMOORE
Shackle him Get him ready to move

The Alliance commandos clap the unconscious Thrall’s hands
and feet in irons Lo’Gosh watches uneasily Hands playing
across the old shackle marks still visible on his own wrists

A TARPAULIN is unfurled on the ground and hitched to the back
of Proudmoore’s horse The soldiers roll Thralls limp body
onto the tarp and lash it around him like a body bag

Proudmoore checks on Jaina She moans semi-conscious He
lifts her onto his shoulder and drapes her over his saddle

Proudmoore and Lo’Gosh mount up and turn their horses back
toward Theramore Proudmoore dragging Thrall behind him as
the Alliance commandos get to work cleaning up the mess

EXT THERAMORE — DAY

Citizens and guards look on excitedly as Proudmoore and
Lo’Gosh ride back into town Proudmoore has a triumphant look
about him Lo’Gosh is more difficult to read

Curious townsfolk congregate around as Proudmoore unties the
tarp behind his horse They step back with a GASP as he
unfurls it to reveal the unconscious Orc inside

PROUDMOORE
Get him to the stockade quickly

Alliance soldiers move in and drag Thrall away as a pair of
Theramore guards assist Jaina down from Proudmoore’s horse
She’s beginning te come around groaning

PROUDMOORE
Jaina Are you all right

Jaina blinks her eyes Still woozy The sight of her father
focuses her She SLAPS HIM HARD IN THE FACE

JAINA
Why Just tell me why

PROUDMOORE
I will not allow this city to fall
But let’s see the Ores attack us
now without their great Warchief
to lead them You cut off the head
and the body dies

JAINA
You arrogant ass Thrall was the
only thing keeping them from
attacking us You should have
trusted him You should have
trusted me

Jaina trembles with anger A tear rolls down her cheek

JAINA
Everything I’ve worked for here
youve undone it all You are not
my father

BEAT That stung Proudmoore He tries to conceal it
PROUDMOORE
We should get that wound looked at
Here let me-
He goes to take her by the arm but the pulls away

JAINA
Don’t touch me

She storms off Lo’Gosh watches her go He appears conflicted
- guilty perhaps Proudmoore turns to him all business

PROUDMOORE
I want you to handle the
interrogation Get to work

EXT THERAMORE DUNGEON - CELL - DAY

Dark dank stone walls Thrall sits in a shadowy corner
shackled to the wall His head hangs low Stripped of his
armor It’s saddening to see him so humbled

The GUARDS outside the cell unlock the iron gate and admit
Lo’Gosh They step inside with him but he motions them back

DUNGEON GUARD
He’s more dangerous than he looks

LO’GOSH
I know exactly how dangerous he is

Lo’Gosh looks at Thrall shackled in the darkness Similar to
how he himself looked at the beginning of our story

The following exchange is in SUBTITLED ORCISH

LOGOSH
Youre a shaman yes

Thrall raises his head his eyes two bright pin-points in the
darkness He says nothing we hear only his slow breathing

LOGOSH
Master of the elements Ive heard
of your kind But I thought you
were all extinct

BEAT And then the CLINKING OF CHAINS as Thrall begins to
move Rising to his feet Stepping now out of the shadows

THRALL
No creature is master of the
elements A shaman strives only to
become one with them But when that
state of being is achieved nothing
can confine its power

Thrall STOPS as his chains pull taut Just inches from
Lo’Gosh And speaks now in PERFECT ENGLISH

THRALL
In short Human - you really have
noidea how dangerous I am

Lo‘Gosh’s eyes widen with astonishment

LOGOSH
You speak-

THRALL
Common is the perception among
Humans that my people are mindless
savages And so it was for many
years But no longer

LO’GOSH
Good That will make this easier I
need to know about your army Force
strengths armaments tactics

THRALL
You wish to know the strength of my
army You will soon enough - when
it comes to burn this city to the
ground

LO’ GOSH
You think theyll come for you

THRALL
For me No They will come only to
spill blood For years I have
labored to lift my people out of
the darkness But there are those
among them who will always be mired
in the old ways The dark ways And
in my absence they will rise again
For you have given them precisely
the excuse they need

Thrall moves back into the shadows sorrowful Lo’Gosh is
confounded by Thrall’s demeanor He heads back to the gate

THRALL
You dont remember do you

LO‘ GOSH
Remember what

THRALL
Hmm It must not yet be time

Lo’Gosh rounds on Thrall angrily Something about that
comment really pushed his buttons

LO’ GOSH
Remember what

Thrall says nothing Again he is just a dark shape lurking
in the shadows Greatly perturbed Lo’Gosh turns and leaves

INT ORGRIMMAR - MILITARY HALL - NIGHT

The walls adorned with weapons and armor SENIOR ORCISH
OFFICERS look on as TWO ORC SCOUTS stand before Grommash A
BLOODIED SCRAP OF THRALL’S ARMOR on the table between them

ORCISH SCOUT

(subtitled Orcish)
Thats all we found And some

traces of Human blood

Grommash examines the bloody armor Bows his head in sorrow

GROMMASH
The Warchief is dead

A grim BEAT And then an ORCISH OFFICER pipes up

ORCISH OFFICER
Long live the Warchief

Grommash looks up to realize that all eyes are on him

ORCISH OFFICER 2
Long live the Warchief

More and more officers pick up the cry chanting it in
unison Grommash’s chest swells a fiercely determined look
in his eye The chanting rising to a crescendo as we CUT TO

EXT THERAMORE KEEP - HALLWAY —- NIGHT
Lo’Gosh walks toward his quarters Still troubled

JAINA (0S)
Whose idea was it

He stops Turns back to see Jaina emerging from the shadows
She’s been waiting for him Her head wound has been dressed

LO’GOSH
Hows your head

JAINA
I asked you a question

LO’GOSH
I told you I’d do whatever was
necessary to help your father avoid
a war

JAINA
And do you believe that’s what
youve done

BEAT Lo’Gosh does not appear entirely sure of himself

LO’GOSH
I don’t know

JAINA
What did Thrall say to you My
father wont allow me to see him

LO’GOSH
Ive lived among Orcs for many
years But he’s not like any I’ve
known Hes almost civil

JAINA
Did he tell you about Durnholde
What really happened when he was a
prisoner there

(off LoGosh’s look)

You should ask him to tell you the
story It’s the reason he was
willing to trust us

A sad look comes over Jaina She turns and walks away

leaving Lo’Gosh to think about what she’s said

INT ORGRIMMAR - HORDE COUNCIL CHAMBER - NIGHT

Filled to the rafters At the center of the chamber stands
Grommash - now adorned in the armor of the WARCHIEF

GROMMASH
Countless times I warned of Human
treachery Well now we have seen
their true nature laid bare And
our great Warchief has paid the
price - in blood

Grommash’s heated rhetoric is stirring the Orcs into a
violent fervor Cairne stands in the shadows concerned

GROMMASH
My first act as your new Warchief
will be in honor of our fallen
leader We will take bloody revenge
in his name The Humans will pay so
dearly their ancestors will feel
their suffering

The assembled Orcs ROAR IN AGGRESSIVE SUPPORT

Cairne can’t

take any more He steps into the center of the chamber

CAIRNE
Enough

The Orcs quieten Cairne stares down Grommash

CAIRNE
I cannot allow this to happen

Cairne turns away from Grommash to address the chamber

CAIRNE
Thrall brought your race back from
the brink of extinction He gave
you a future Turning our back on
the old hatreds was the foundation
of everything he built here

GROMMASH
Cairne you’ve been a fine ally in
time of peace But now war is upon
us Either you stand with the Horde
in battle or not at all

CAIRNE
This is a desecration of everything
Thrall believed in I will not have
any part in it nor will any of my
people

GROMMASH
Perhaps we should settle this in
the old fashion Cairne You wish
to lead the Horde Then challenge
me for the right

All eyes are on he and Cairne the atmosphere is tense

GROMMASH
Challenge me in unarmed combat or
lead your people from this city
And leave this war to those with
the courage to fight it

You could hear a pin drop And then Cairne STEPS FORWARD AND
CASTS OFF HIS CLOAK Ready to fight

Grommash grins cracks his knuckles Unbuckles his scabbard
and lets his sword fall to the ground The assembled Horde
watch rapt as the two great warriors circle each other

-AND CLASH The watching Horde surge forward on the tiered
balconies jostling for a view of the action

This is not an elegant fight It is a bestial brawl defined
entirely by power and fury After a desperate grapple Cairne
hurls Grommash against the chamber wall SMASHING IT

Cairne ROARS and charges at the dazed Grommash who evades
with inches to spare before flooring Cairne with a VICIOUS
HOOK TO THE JAW Grommash pounces and they grapple again

Cairne gets the upper hand He has Grommash pinned choking
the life from him But unseen by spectators Grommash DRAWS A
HIDDEN DAGGER and slashes Cairne across the arm As Cairne
CRIES OUT and falls backward Grommash conceals the blade

Grommash charges the reeling Cairne FLOORS HIM with a
powerful punch Cairne CRASHES TO THE FLOOR Grommash picks
up his sword unsheathes it as he stands over Cairne

GROMMASH
All challenges are to the death

Grommash draws back his sword but several OUTRAGED TAUREN
rush to stop him ORC GUARDS move to intercept them and a
BRAWL breaks out as the Tauren drag Cairne to safety
GROMMASH

The Tauren have now shown their

cowardice for all to see They are

hereby exiled from the Horde
He raises his fist victorious

GROMMASH
The army marches at dawn

The assembled Orcs ROAR in approval
EXT ORGRIMMAR - DAWN

Cairne limping from his injuries leads a grim procession of
the Tauren people out of Orgrimmar and across the plains

Grommash watches from the ramparts as the exiled Tauren
depart He turns to his senior aide COLONEL GAR’THOK

GROMMASH
The army is ready

GAR’ THOK
Ive never seen them thirstier for
blood sire

GROMMASH
Good

He turns and looks out to the horizon toward Theramore

GROMMASH
Today they will drink deep

INT THERAMORE DUNGEON - CELL - DAWN

Lo’Gosh stands with a tray of food before the manacled
Thrall who sits in a dark corner eyes closed Meditative

LOGOSH
I brought you something to eat

Thrall doesn’t respond Lo‘Gosh puts the tray on the floor
between them shoves it toward Thrall with his foot

LOGOSH
What happened at Durnholde

That gets Thralls attention His eyes open He reaches out
and takes an apple from the tray of food examines it

THRALL
I heard one of the guards speak
your name Ghost Wolf Youre the
Human who lived among Orcs We have
more in common than you realize

LOGOSH
What do you mean

THRALL
We were both renamed by our
captors My birth-name is “Go-El”
It’s an ancient word little used
any more Do you know what it
means

LOGOSH
“Redeemer”

THRALL
Now you know my true name Perhaps
you could tell me yours

BEAT Not a comfortable subject for Lo’Gosh

LO’GOSH
What happened at Durnholde

Thrall takes a bite of his apple

THRALL
After the Second War the Alliance
raided every Orcish settlement they
could find determined to purge us
from their lands I was captured
and taken to Durnholde with other

prisoners of war
(MORE)

THRALL (CONTD)
The commandant there a Human named
Blackmoore saw that I was unlike
the others - a shaman not a
warrior - and decided to torment
me He forced me to fight Pitted
me against my Orc brothers in
gladiatorial games to amuse him He
named me Thrall to remind me that
I would always be his slave

Thrall speaks with great sorrow as he relays these painful
memories Lo’Gosh listens trying to remain detached

THRALL

Everything about Humans that Orcs
have been taught to hate was
manifest in that man But there was
another A servant girl who took
pity on me She snuck me food from
the kitchens tended my wounds
Taught me your language She was my
friend

(beat)
Then one day Blackmoore discovered
her He had her executed for
treason and raised her head on a
spike over the keep’s walls as an
example to others

Lo’Gosh is stunned to see a TEAR ROLL DOWN THRALL’S CHEEK

THRALL
Since then I’ve been fascinated by
the duality of Humankind You are a
curious people Capable of such
hideous cruelty and at once such
great kindness and charity A
species at war with your own nature
- much like my own

LO’GOSH
Why do you still keep the name the
Humans gave you

THRALL
It is a reminder to me that I spent
much of my life as their prisoner
I have sworn to devote the rest of
it to ensuring that no Ore will
ever do so again

LO’GOSH
Then why haven’t you driven out the
Humans here
(MORE)

LOGOSH (CONTD)
You have the superior army Orcish
tradition demands that you-

THRALL
I am a student of history And
history teaches us that either we
heed the mistakes of our past - or
else relive them in an endless
cycle Orcs and Humans are locked
in a cycle of hatred each
generations prejudices handed down
to the next If either of our
peoples are to survive it has to
end You need something to tell
Proudmoore Tell him that

BEAT Lo’Gosh clearly affected by all that he has heard He
turns to exit then stops at the cell door Turns back

LO’GOSH
Taretha
(beat)
The girl who helped you Her name
was Taretha

THRALL
(eyes widen)
You remember

Lo’Gosh marches angrily back toward Thrall
LO‘GOSH

How do I know that How could T
possibly know that

THRALL
The answers will come Fate has
brought you this far And you must
trust that it will take you the
rest of the way

THERAMORE’S ALARM BELLS SOUND 0S Followed quickly by the
sounds of PANIC AND SHOUTING on the streets above

Lo’Gosh turns and rushes for the door Thrall gazes up at the
dank dungeon ceiling listening to the muted sounds of panic
above He knows what it means Hangs his head low in sorrow

EXT THERAMORE ISLE - CONTINUOUS
CHAOS Panicked citizens rush in every direction Soldiers

usher townsfolk from the farmland outside the city walls
through the main gate preparing to seal it behind them

Lo’Gosh rushes across the square and up a flight of stone
steps leading to Theramore’s battlements Proudmoore is
already there Looking out grimly onto the plains beyond

»ewhere GROMMASHS ARMY IS ASSEMBLING LEGIONS OF ORCS
already in formation COUNTLESS MORE arriving out of the
marshlands HUGE SIEGE ENGINES being moved into position

Proudmoore shows no fear He’s utterly calm and composed

PROUDMOORE
Well it would appear that we’ve
misjudged our enemy

An ALLIANCE OFFICER rushes to Proudmoore to report

ALLIANCE OFFICER
Sir all gun crews at the ready
Were mustering what infantry we
have at the main gate

LO’ GOSH
What are you doing

PROUDMOORE
They may have us outnumbered but
if they think they’re going to take
this city without a bloody good
fight theyre very much mistaken

LO’ GOSH
Are you insane You can’t repel
that army Look at it

PROUDMOORE
What other options are there
Surrender I’1l die first

LO’ GOSH
Thrall is still their true leader
I don’t believe he wants a war any
more than we do If we let him-

Proudmoore wheels on Lo’Gosh cutting him off

PROUDMOORE
Either you stand with us or you
stand out there with them I think
it’s time you decided whose side
youre really on

BEAT - then LoGosh turns and hurries back down the wall
steps toward the center of town

INT THERAMORE KEEP - JAINA’S CHAMBERS - MORNING

As the sounds of chaos continue outside Jaina calmly gives
orders to one of her GUARD CAPTAINS as Buttonwillow looks on

We won’t get many out that way

JAINA
I know But we must save all that
we can Go now hurry

The guard nods and rushes off

BUTTONWILLOW
I knew it would come to this

JAINA
If you dont have anything helpful
to say I’d just as soon you said
nothing at all

BEAT Jaina instantly regrets having said that

JAINA
Im sorry Forgive me Perhaps you
and I together we can-

BUTTONWILLOW
That is not why we were empowered
It’s not why I trained you

JAINA
I know I know But I can’t just
stand idle and watch these people
die I swore an oath to protect
them

BUTTONWILLOW
You swore an oath even greater than
that one Or do you not remember

JAINA
I remember I still must do
whatever else I can

BUTTONWILLOW
I know Ill help you

INT THERAMORE - SCHOOLHOUSE - DAY

Jaina and Buttonwillow help teachers to usher schoolchildren
into underground shelters Hatches in the floor open to
reveal stone steps leading down into darkened bunkers

JAINA
Come on children That’s it As
fast as you can

Jaina notices one of the teachers is having trouble with a
CRYING CHILD who refuses to go down into the shelter

JAINA
Kevin whats the matter

KEVIN
Why can’t we go on the ships with
the others

JAINA
All the ships are full You‘ll be
just as safe down there I promise

KEVIN
I dont like it down there It’s
dark

JAINA

Its just for a little while Mrs
Davenport will be with you so will
all your friends It’s very
important - will you do it for me

She smiles warmly Kevin wipes away a tear and nods

JAINA
Good boy come on

As Kevin heads down into the shelter Lo’Gosh appears in the
doorway He spots Jaina and rushes to her She glances at him
dismissively as she carries on with her work

JAINA
Dont you have a battle to fight

LO’GOSH
Come on I’m getting you out of
here I’m putting you on a ship

He tries to take her by the arm but she shakes him off

JAINA
This is my city These are my
people I stand with them

LOGOSH
If you stay here you’re going to
die with them

JAINA
And you

LO’GOSH
I helped set all this in motion
Its only right that I stay and
face the consequences

Jaina is surprised by that It’s the first genuinely noble
selfless thing she’s heard him say

LO’GOSH

It doesn’t matter what happens to
me Its too late to stop this now
And what begins here could consume
all of Azeroth But when this war
is over the world is going to need
people who have the faith and the
courage to rebuild it

BEAT Jaina clearly affected by those words

JAINA
You think quoting the words of a
dead king is going to persuade me

Lo’Gosh looks puzzled no idea what she’s talking about
Jaina grabs a pile of blankets and shoves them at LoGosh

JAINA
I was sent here to protect the
people of this city And that’s
what Im going to do If you’re
staying then make yourself useful

EXT THERAMORE ISLE - CONTINUOUS

GROMMASH is mounted on a wolf at the head of the Orcish
battle formations He smells the air as Gar’Thok approaches

GROMMASH
A good day for a war wouldn’t you
say Colonel

GARTHOK
Yes sire

GROMMASH
Artillery at the ready

GAR‘ THOK
At your command

BEAT Grommash savoring the moment before he gives the order

GROMMASH
Open fire

GarThok shouts an order to the artillerymen They LIGHT THE
OIL-SOAKED BOULDERS in their giant catapults and LOOSE THEM

Theramore soldiers dive for cover as the flaming boulders
SMASH INTO THE CITY WALLS Others fly overhead and CRASH INTO
BUILDINGS destroying them in FIERY EXPLOSIONS

PROUDMOORE
Return fire

The ALLIANCE CANNONEERS on the city battlements OPEN FIRE
The cannonballs PLOUGH INTO THE ORCISH FORMATIONS sending
soldiers hurtling through the air in all directions

Grommash looks at Theramore’s walls - damaged and smoking
from the first catapult attack but still intact

GROMMASH
Give me another volley I want
those walls destroyed

The Ore artillerymen reload as a VOLLEY OF ARROWS is loosed
from archers along Theramore’s walls The Ores duck behind
their shields as the ARROWS RAIN DOWN UPON THEM Most are
deflected but many Orcs are felled

The Orcish catapults FIRE AGAIN MORE FIERY BOULDERS CRASH
DOWN WITHIN THE CITY WALLS Two boulders hit the wall
directly and BLOW APART A PARAPET obliterating a gun crew
Grommash sees a GROWING CRACK in Theramore’s wall

GROMMASH
Again Target that wall

The artillerymen hurry to reload once again All the while
INCOMING CANNON FIRE blasting the Ore formations

THERAMORE - MAIN GATE INTERIOR

Alliance troops move into position by the main gate A
sizable force but not nearly as many as the Orcish numbers

Proudmoore stands at the spearhead of the Alliance forces
addressing the men Sword drawn and at the ready

PROUDMOORE
On my signal advance and meet
their charge at the breach point
Do not let them inside the city

ORCISH BATTLE LINES

The catapults OPEN FIRE The concentrated volley SMASHING
INTO THERAMORE’S WALL As the smoke clears it reveals A
JAGGED GAP IN THE WALL Wide enough to lead a charge through

GROMMASH
For the Horde Lok’tar Ogar

Victory or Death The battle cry is ECHOED BY THE ENTIRE ORC
ARMY A deafening roar that sends a chill down Human spines

The Orc army SURGES FORWARD Grommash the tip of the spear
THERAMORE - MAIN GATE INTERIOR

Proudmoore’s forces stand behind the breached wall watching
as the Horde army bears down on them A couple of the local
Theramore soldiers DROP THEIR WEAPONS and run away panic-
stricken Proudmoore stands firm

PROUDMOORE
Youwill hold this line

Grommash brandishes his double-bladed axe as he reaches the
wall and LEAPS ON HIS WOLF MOUNT OVER THE HEADS OF THE
HUMAN FRONT LINE LANDING AMONG THE ALLIANCE TROOPS

He leaps from his mount swinging his axe SLAYING ALLIANCE
SOLDIERS LEFT AND RIGHT The riderless wolf tears into the
Alliance lines MAULING TROOPS with its fangs CHAOS

And then the full force of the Orc army PILES INTO THE HUMAN
LINES The two armies CLASH in a whirlwind of blood and fury

Theramore’s defenders fight valiantly but the Orcs are just
too many The Alliance line weakens and then COLLAPSES
TOTALLY Countless Orcs now TEEMING THROUGH THE WALL

Proudmoore is at the center of the fray fighting like a
bulldog with sword and shield Teeth clenched as he clashes
with the Orcs a warrior totally in his element

LoGosh Jaina and Buttonwillow emerge from the schoolhouse
to see townsfolk fleeing in all directions as the Ores
stampede through the city slaying anyone in their path

JAINA
Light preserve us

LO‘GOSH
I need a weapon

An ORC WARRIOR rushes at them brandishing a sword As the
Ore swings at Lo’Gosh he feints at the last moment - just
like in the arena - then grabs the Ore’s sword arm and twists
it inward DRIVING HIS OWN SWORD CLEAN THROUGH HIM The Orc
topples backward and crashes to the ground dead

Lo’Gosh takes the Orc’s sword and hefts it the bloody steel
glistening in the sunlight It feels good

LO’GOSH
Thats better

JAINA
We have to get to the armory

Jaina leads them away down the street as chaos continues all
around But as they round a corner Jaina is dismayed to see

HERAMORE ARMORY IN FLAMES Already sacked by the Orcs who
now swarm around it slaying the last of its defenders

LO’GOSH
Thats it I’m getting you out of
here now

JAINA
I wont leave these people to
perish

LO’ GOSH

Look around you A warrior knows

when to fight and when to run
(beat)

There are going to be more people

who need you - you can’t help them

if you’re dead

Jaina reluctantly nods agreement And they race off toward
THERAMORE HARBOR

Ships teeming with citizens hurriedly departing Others still
being boarded Lo’Gosh heads for the closest ship

just as a PARTY OF ORCISH RAIDERS rushes headlong into the
harbor ahead of them Clashing swords with Theramore guards
the furious melee blocking any escape route to the ships

A GROUP OF ORCS spot our heroes and start toward them
BUTTONWILLOW
I think this is one of those times
when you run

LO’ GOSH
I think you’re right

They turn and run Headed toward the nearby LIGHTHOUSE
THERAMORE LIGHTHOUSE STEPS

Lo’Gosh and Jaina race up the spiral steps Buttonwillow
dashes to keep up - the steps are steep for a Gnome

The Orcs pursue only moments behind
TOP OF LIGHTHOUSE
They arrive at the top They’re trapped nowhere else to run

LO’GOSH
Okay now what

JAINA
I was following you

LO’ GOSH
What made you think I had a plan

The Orcs arrive at the top of the stairs Four of them
heavily armed and thirsty for blood

LO’GOSH
Stay back

LoGosh flourishes his sword as the Orcs ATTACK He quickly
slays the first one and as the second charges at him he
turns his body and flips the Ore over his shoulder - THROUGH
THE LIGHTHOUSE GLASS sending him plummeting to his death

The third Ore SLASHES LO’GOSH ACROSS HIS SWORD ARM Lo’Gosh
drops his sword wounded The Orcs move in for the kill

-and then Buttonwillow steps forward BLOCKING THEM
BUTTONWILLOW
Why don’t you try picking on
somebody your own size

The Orcs exchange bemused looks - and SNORT WITH LAUGHTER
They raise their swords to cut down the Gnome

Buttonwillow’s hands CRACKLE WITH MAGICAL ENERGY and ina
flash both Orcs are TRANSFORMED INTO SHEEP

BUTTONWILLOW
Hmmm I must be a little rusty
They were supposed to be chickens

LoGosh looks in astonishment at the two harmless sheep
which BLEAT as they wander around confused

LOGOSH
ehow did you

JAINA
She’s not my advisor Im her
apprentice She’s Archmage Aegywnn
Last Guardian of Tirisfal

AEGWYNN
Second-to-last Technically I’m
retired

Lo’Gosh’s mind reels as he tries to catch up

LO‘’GOSH
You don’t look like your portrait

AEGWYNN
Yes that would be the point
Harder for your enemies to kill you
if they think youre already dead

INT THERAMORE ISLE -— CONTINUOUS

Proudmoore is at the center of what remains of the Alliance
defense forces still fighting valiantly

ALLIANCE CAPTAIN
Sir You have to signal the
retreat

PROUDMOORE
Retreat I’1l have none of it

ALLIANCE CAPTAIN
Theramore is lost Would you see us
slaughtered to the last man

Proudmoore looks around And it’s clear that their cause is
lost - the last of his forces on the verge of being routed
Hes about to give an order when we hear a DEEP SOUND PASSING
OVERHEAD Almost like a SONIC BOOM

-as a CANNONBALL PLOUGHS INTO THE ORCISH LINES sending
bodies flying Proudmoore looks up to see MORE CANNONBALLS
SOARING OVERHEAD CRASHING INTO ANOTHER ORCISH FORMATION

PROUDMOORE
Wheres that fire coming from

THERAMORE LIGHTHOUSE

LoGosh and Jaina look out from the lighthouse toward the
sea From this high vantage point they can see what it is

LO’ GOSH
Its the rest of the fleet

And now we see it too Sailing out of the sun is the DEFIANT
Headed full-tilt toward Theramore at the head of the ALLIANCE
ARMADA A flotilla of NIGHT ELF SHIPS sailing alongside

DEFIANT FOREDECK

Stormpike lowers his spyglass with a smile Behind him smoke
wisps from the muzzles of a dozen ALLIANCE CANNONS

STORMPIKE

Excellent shot Mister Chinnery
Another volley at the same range
if you please

(to helmsman)
Bend every sail you’ve got Mister
Bisley Let’s try to get into this
fight before it’s over

EXT THERAMORE ISLE - CONTINUOUS

ANOTHER CANNON VOLLEY smashes into the Orcish lines The
Alliance troops are spurred on morale surging Though still
outnumbered they now fight with an increased ferocity

EXT THERAMORE ISLE - HARBOR - CONTINUOUS

The Defiant sails into Theramore at speed practically
RAMMING THE WHARF as it pulls into the dock HUNDREDS OF
ALLIANCE TROOPS rush from the ship and onto the dock

STORMPIKE
Infantry hold position Rifle
battery two lines now

The infantrymen hold position as a brigade of DWARF RIFLEMEN
armed with wide-barreled flintlocks forms up on the harbor

PRIVATE JENKINS stands with the infantry behind the riflemen
clenching his sword Restless eager to join the battle

He watches as a Theramore guard clashes with an Ore on the
harbor nearby and BREAKS RANKS rushing forward to help
flourishing his sword with a zealous BATTLE CRY °

STORMPIKE
Jenkins Get your arse back here

Jenkins clashes swords with an Orc parrying a few blows
before he is CUT DOWN Stormpike curses under his breath as
Jenkins slumps to the ground dead

STORMPIKE
Front rank fire

The riflemen OPEN FIRE A deafening cacophony of gunfire that
fells multiple Orcs As the front rank reloads

STORMPIKE
Second rank fire

ANOTHER RIFLE VOLLEY fells more Orcs

STORMPIKE
Fire and advance by rank

As the second rank reloads it dashes forward to become the
new front rank and the riflemen behind them FIRE AGAIN More
Orcs are cut down - and now they begin to fall back

STORMPIKE
All right lads let’s show these
bastards what were made of For
the Alliance

Stormpike’s men ROAR and follow him into battle CLASHING
WITH THE ORCS Suddenly the complexion of the battle changes
much more evenly matched now with more Alliance troops
spilling onto the dock as more ships arrive in the harbor

THE FIRST NIGHT ELF SHIP arrives NIGHT ELF WARRIORS rushing
into battle The Elves move with an unparalleled speed and
agility sprinting ahead of their Human counterparts and
fighting with a martial prowess that is simply astonishing
Whirling and leaping with staggering agility Just a handful
of them creating panic and disarray among hundreds of Orcs

As they fight the Night Elves seem to PHASE IN AND OUT like
shadows becoming formless and semi-visible and then re
appearing It makes them almost impossible to hit back at

TYRANDE is among her Night Elves commanding them in battle
A pair of Orcs round on her - the only Elf not carrying a
weapon she appears an easy target But as they close in she
MORPHS INTO A GIANT BEAR fangs bared and snarling

The Ores try to turn tail and run but Tyrande is too fast -
she POUNCES FORWARD and brings them down mauling them

Grommash can see the tide of the battle turning the newly-
reinforced Alliance forces pushing his troops back

GAR’ THOK
Warchief We must withdraw
GROMMASH
Never
GAR’ THOK

We must The Alliance are too many
And the Night Elves have joined
them We are undone

Grommash surveys the scene of battle before him The Alliance
surging forward his forces falling back GarThok is right

GROMMASH
Sound the retreat And Gar’Thok - I
want everything burned

WIDE CRANE SHOT from above the field of battle shows the
waves of reinforced Alliance troops pushing the Ore army back
toward Theramore’s perimeter (this angle reminiscent of the
well-known top-down POV from the Warcraft strategy games)

As Grommash’s troops retreat they STRIKE TORCHES and set
fire to everything they pass - thatched roofs hay bales
wooden stockpiles Soon Theramore is in a FIRESTORM as the
Ore troops retreat back through the breached wall

Lo’Gosh Jaina and Buttonwillow emerge from the lighthouse
Jaina in dismay at the sight of her city in flames She grabs
a THERAMORE GUARD CAPTAIN as he rushes past

JAINA
Captain

THERAMORE CAPTAIN
Weve got these buggers on the run
now ma’am

JAINA
Forget the Orcs We’ve got to get
these fires out The city could yet
be lost Come on

Jaina leads the Captain away Lo’Gosh scans the chaos around
him clutching his sword Spots a fleeing Orc approaching a
building with a burning torch and rushes to intercept him
94

As the Orc is about to fire the building LoGosh SLICES OFF
THE BURNING END OF HIS TORCH WITH HIS SWORD The Ore raises
his sword to attack but Lo’Gosh expertly cuts him down

Nearby Grommash’s anger rises as he watches his men flee
his plans in ruins Through the flames he sees Lo’Gosh slay
the torch-carrying Ore and RUSHES AT HIM IN A BLIND FURY

Lo’Gosh’s blood is up from the thrill of combat He rushes to
meet Grommash head-on and they CLASH Grommash swipes at
Lo’Gosh with his axe Lo’Gosh blocks it the blow pushing him
backward Grommash attacks again and again With each strike
he seems to grow stronger fueled by a burning fury

Lo’Gosh has never fought an Ore this powerful this enraged
Its all he can do to fend off his relentless attacks An
overhead axe blow knocks him clean off his feet sword
skittering away across the cobblestones

Grommash moves in for the killer blow but Lo’Gosh counters
kicking his legs away and knocking him to the ground Now the
two warriors GRAPPLE Grommash’s hands at LoGosh’s throat
Lo’Gosh claws desperately at Grommash as he chokes him with
all his might driven entirely by raw hatred and rage

-and his eyes begin to GLOW burning with a DEMONIC FIRE —
the twisted writhing forms of GIANT HORNED DEMONS within
Windows into a world of pure evil It horrifies Lo’Gosh

LoGosh continues to struggle but he’s losing consciousness
Its almost lights-out - when a GUNSHOT STRIKES GROMMASH IN
THE SHOULDER Grommash cries out and falls backward Lo‘Gosh
leaps to his feet and grabs up his sword looking for
Grommash - but he is gone disappeared into the flames

Stormpike appears behind Lo’Gosh reloading his musket

STORMPIKE
Looks like you owe me one lad

LoGosh spots something - shoves Stormpike aside just as
ANOTHER ORC COMES AT HIM FROM BEHIND SWORD FLAILING Another
second and Stormpike would have been cleaved in two Lo’Gosh
RUNS THE ORC THROUGH WITH HIS SWORD Stormpike watches as the
Ore slumps dead at his feet

STORMPIKE
Well that didn’t last long

EXT THERAMORE TAVERN - CONTINUOUS
The “Fox and Anchor” is engulfed in flames Jaina stands at

the head of a BUCKET BRIGADE comprised of Theramore guards
and townsfolk trying desperately to fight the fires

Bucket after bucket of water is hurled onto the fires but
it’s not enough Theyre raging out of control

Across the street Theramore’s CHURCH is also ablaze Reduced
to a skeleton of charred timbers The wooden framework CREAKS
as the fires weaken it further beginning to give way

Jaina hears the GROANING of wood turns to see the church
steeple TOPPLING RIGHT TOWARD THEM

JAINA
Move Move

She tries to usher people away but there’s no time - the
burning church steeple is going to collapse right on top of
them She looks up in horror facing certain death

And then suddenly the COLLAPSING STEEPLE FREEZES IN MID-AIR
Held in suspension just a few feet over Jaina and the others

REVEAL BUTTONWILLOWAEGWYNN standing beneath the collapsing
structure holding it up with a MAGICAL ENERGY FIELD

AEGWYNN
Go Get them out of here

Its a struggle for Aegwynn to keep the steeple suspended
She gives it everything she’s got but her magical field is
weakening Jaina hesitates then grabs the nearest citizen
and pulls him along as she moves clear of the steeple

JAINA
Come on Everybody move

As the townsfolk get clear Jaina looks back to see Aegwynn’s
power weakening She’s about to rush back to help - but it’s
too late The burning steeple COLLAPSES DOWN ON AEGWYNN

JAINA
Aegwynn NO

She runs toward the burning wreckage but Lo’Gosh appears and
restrains her

LOGOSH
Jaina stop There’s nothing-

Jaina pushes LoGosh away rushes back to the wreckage of the
collapsed steeple Kneels at its edge and raises her hands
palms upturned Eyes closed focusing

and a BURNING TIMBER LEVITATES FROM THE WRECKAGE Then
another And another Soon Jaina is MAGICALLY LIFTING THE
ENTIRE STEEPLE WRECKAGE STILL ABLAZE OFF THE GROUND

LoGosh rushes in beneath the wreckage Aegwynn lies amid the
debris her body broken and burned As Jaina strains to keep
the wreckage aloft Lo’Gosh hauls Aegwynn into the clear

Jaina releases the wreckage letting it crash back down and
rushing to Aegwynn’s side She’s barely alive

JAINA
Master

Aegwynn’s eyes flicker open find Jaina She reaches up and
touches her face tenderly

AEGWYNN
You were always a good student

A tear rolls down Jaina’s cheek She tries to smile

JAINA
You broke your own rule You used
magic in plain sight

AEGWYNN
If I hadnt you’d be dead And
Azeroth needs you now

Aegwynn’s voice is weakening her life ebbing away

AEGWYNN
The time I’ve trained you for is
upon us The Legion will come Ive
seen it And you must stand against
them as Guardian of Tirisfal

JAINA
No I’m not ready I need you I
can’t do this alone

Aegwynn grips Jaina’s hand tightly

AEGWYNN
Youre ready And you wont be
alone

Aegwynn’s voice is barely a whisper now Jaina leans closer
Aegwynn’s eyes glance toward Lo’Gosh standing nearby

BUTTONWILLOW
Trust him He is more than he
appears to be
(beat)
Much more

And with that AEGWYNN DIES in Jaina’s arms

Jaina looks around her filled with grief Though the Orcs
are now in full retreat her city burns all around her
beyond saving She lowers her head and begins to quietly
weep Lo’Gosh looks on grimly unable to comfort her

INT THERAMORE DUNGEON - CELL - CONTINUOUS

Thrall gazes up at the ceiling He can hear the muted sounds
of burning buildings and the cries of Theramore’s townsfolk

He kneels bows his head low And begins MEDITATING His
concentration absolute summoning his Shamanistic powers

EXT THERAMORE ISLE - CONTINUOUS

LoGosh and the others react as they hear something overhead
A GREAT RUMBLING They look up to see

DARK THUNDERCLOUDS forming in the sky overhead A STORM
GATHERING Too large and too fast to be a natural occurrence

INT THERAMORE DUNGEON - CELL - CONTINUOUS

Thrall continues chanting his eyes closed a picture of deep
concentration Praying ever more urgently

INT THERAMORE ISLE - CONTINUOUS

The storm clouds roil as they gather and darken overhead
casting all of Theramore in their shadow

and it begins to RAIN A TORRENTIAL MONSOON that drenches
everything within Theramore’s walls DOUSING THE FIRES

Within moments every fire in the city has been extinguished
As the last one dies out the STORMCLOUDS PART the sun
breaking through to shine down on Theramore once more

INT THERAMORE DUNGEON - CELL -— CONTINUOUS

Thrall’s eyes SNAP OPEN He slumps to the floor gasping as
he relinquishes control of the elements Totally spent

EXT THERAMOREDUSTWALLOW MARSH - CONTINUOUS

The last of the Orcs are chased out of Theramore in full
retreat As Grommash’s army withdraws along the marshlands
an encampment of MURLOCS - diminutive amphibious humanoids —
are sent scattering their village trampled underfoot

The Alliance and Theramore forces CHEER TRIUMPHANTLY as they
watch the Ores flee en masse toward the horizon

INT THERAMORE DUNGEON - CELL - DAY

Lo’Gosh enters adrenaline still pumping from battle His
face and armor stained with blood Thrall sits in the corner
head hung low He looks exhausted

LO’GOSH
Your army’s been defeated They’re
retreating as we speak

THRALL
Your city It no longer burns

Lo’Gosh steps further inside as he realizes

LO’ GOSH
That was you

THRALL
The army that attacked you does not
fight in my name This is not what
I wanted

LO’GOSH
Then what do you want Peace It’s
not possible Ive lived among
Ores I’ve seen their true nature
And I saw it again today

THRALL
What I want is a new beginning For
my people to return to their true
selves Before the darkness came

LO’ GOSH
What darkness

THRALL
Its true for as long as you have
known us the Orcs have been
warriors But it was not always so

EXT ANCESTRAL ORCISH HOMELANDS (FLASHBACK) - DAY

GREAT ORC VILLAGES sprawl across a land of lush rolling
hills a primitive but peaceful civilization

THRALL (V0)
For five thousand years we lived in
peace We existed in harmony with
the land and other races And then
came the demon lords From what
hellfire realm we did not yet
understand
99

The skies TURN RED FIERY STORMCLOUDS above DEMONIC SHAPES
taking form within ORCS emerge from their tents and huts to
stare up at the sky

THRALL (V0)
They corrupted my people sewing
paranoia and fear They convinced
them that the other races they had
always lived with in peace were
conspiring to destroy them And
they struck a bargain

EXT THE BARRENS (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT

AN ORC ARMY on the move Seen only in SILHOUETTE they attack
a nearby village of peaceful TROLLS The defenseless
villagers BRUTALLY CUT DOWN by the rampaging Orcs

In the fiery skies overhead the clouds twist and roil
subtly taking on the form of a HORNED DEMON LORD Smiling

THRALL (VO)
Power such as no mortal race had
ever dreamed Power to crush our
enemies to conquer all of Azeroth
And all the demons asked in return
was our eternal allegiance That we
become their slaves

The demon now stands among the Orcs A giant four-legged

beast with ram-like horns and eyes burning with green fire
An ORC CHIEFTAIN stands before him drinking a thick dark
liquid from a goblet His eyes burn red The demon smiles

THRALL (VO)
My people drank the blood of the
demon general Mannoroth and were
consumed by it They became pawns
of the Burning Legion

In the distance a LONE ORC walks across the plain away from
the assembled Orcs In his arms he carries an INFANT ORC

THRALL (V0)
Only my father refused He tried to
reason with his people to turn
them away from the corruption but
their lust for power was already
too great He was banished from his
own clan for his defiance So he
left to walk his own path To raise
his son in the true ways of the
Ores In the hopes that one day I
might return to free them

INT THERAMORE DUNGEON - CELL - RETURN TO SCENE

ON LO’GOSH as he listens intently Thralls sto

having a profound effect on him

LOGOSH
I fought an Ore today Unlike any
Ive seen His eyes I could have
sworn I saw a demon within them

THRALL
His face marked with black runes

LoGosh nods Thrall sighs knowingly

THRALL
After our defeat in the Second War
the Legion abandoned my people and
their hold over them weakened But
still there are many among us who
never truly found their way home
(immensely sad)

I tried to keep my promise to my
father I’ve done all I can to save
my people to show them who they
once were and can be again But
perhaps it was not enough

He looks up at Lo’Gosh

THRALL
Perhaps I could not do it alone

LoGosh’s mind is reeling

LO’GOSH
Durotan your father was Durotan
I know this story I’ve heard it
before How can that be

THRALL
Ask yourself why are you here Do
you think it’s by mere accident or
do you believe as I do that destiny
has brought you here to this place
Now at this time

Lo’Gosh clutches his head He feels like he’s g
like his head is primed to explode

LO’ GOSH
These arent my memories I know
these things but they aren’t my
memories

ry clearly

oing crazy

He looks at Thrall in desperation

LOGOSH
Who am I Who am I

Thrall extends his hand

THRALL
If you trust me I can show you

BEAT And then Lo’Gosh reaches out and clasps Thralls hand

THRALL PULLS HIM CLOSE Places his other hand over Lo’Goshs
forehead and stares deep into his eyes

THRALL
Remember and become who you were
born to be

LoGoshs eyes glaze over as though in a hypnotic state
PUSH IN CLOSE ON LO’GOSH as we enter

EXT THE GREAT SEA - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

AN ALLIANCE FLAGSHIP ploughs across the stormy sea The lions-
head flag flapping in the wind and rain atop the mainmast

The crew battles to keep the ship on course Lashing down the
deck running up rigging as waves crash over the bow

A MAN strides across the storm-tossed deck Dressed in
shining armor and a flowing cloak affixed with the royal
insignia This is KING VARIAN WRYNN A young man but
with a resolute authoritative air about him

And there’s something familiar about him too It takes us a
moment to recognize it VARIAN IS ALSO LO’GOSH Fifteen years
younger well-groomed clean-shaven unscarred

Varian approaches the helm hunched against the driving rain

VARIAN
How much lenger until we’re through
this storm

HELMSMAN
Dont know sire Bloody thing
wont quit If I didn’t know better-

The helmsman trails off as he notices something up ahead AN
OMINOUS GREEN GLOW in the clouds above Growing brighter

And we realize now that it’s COMING RIGHT AT US A FLAMING
GREEN METEOR the size of a boulder

Varian grabs the helmsman and throws him to the deck
shielding him as the meteor SMASHES INTO THE HELM shredding
the ship’s wheel into flaming splinters

Panic breaks out on the deck as ANOTHER METEOR STREAKS FROM
THE SKY AND ANOTHER Like a hellish firestorm They CRASH
INTO THE DECK smashing great holes through the timbers

ALLIANCE SOLDIERS form a protective detail around the King
Varian gazes in awe at the smoking holes in his ship’s deck

And then THE ENTIRE SHIP RUMBLES AS SOMETHING EMERGES FROM
ONE OF THE HOLES

AN INFERNAL A creature of living demonic fire The stuff of
nightmares The Alliance soldiers are frozen in horror

ANOTHER INFERNAL climbs up from below deck AND ANOTHER They
move forward as one feet scorching the deck as they walk

The soldiers draw their weapons and rush to confront them
swords flailing But they are no match for the infernals who
rampage across the deck casting soldiers and crewmen
overboard Unstoppable TORCHING THE SHIP as they go

Varian finds himself backed against the stern Rolls to avoid
a BURNING MAST as it crashes down onto the deck

The infernals close in on Varian He has nowhere to run The
ship now beginning to go down by the head Doomed to sink

In the sky above the dark storm clouds twist and roil to
take on the form a HORNED DEMONIC FACE Grinning And it’s
almost as though the wind and thunder is LAUGHING

Enraged Varian brandishes his sword and with a mighty roar
CHARGES THE INFERNALS Fighting to the last

The lead infernal CRASHES ITS FIST INTO THE DECK RUPTURING
IT Varian is THROWN OVERBOARD IN A FIERY EXPLOSION

Varian splashes down into the churning sea unconscious
Sinking beneath the waves as his ship burns above him

His EYES SNAP OPEN Feels himself sinking deeper His cloak
and armor weighing him down He struggles to free himself
Unclasps his royal insignia and lets his cloak fall away
Unstraps his armor and pulls it from his body His regal
trappings disappearing into the murky depths below

Varian swims for his life headed up toward the light from
the burning ship above

Varian hits the surface gasping for air He grabs onto a
hunk of timber to stay afloat and watches as the stern of
his ship sinks beneath the waves and is gone

EXT KALIMDOR BEACH - DAWN (FLASHBACK)
Bordered by wild tropical jungle Untamed country

Varian lies washed up on the beach Face down in the sand
unconscious Dressed only in a tattered jerkin and pants

AN ORCISH HAND ENTERS FRAME and rolls him over onto his back
Varian is battered and bruised a NASTY WELT on his forehead

His eyes flicker open The faces of the two ORC HUNTERS
standing over him coming slowly into focus His eyes widen in
fear at the sight of them And we MATCH CUT TO

INT THERAMORE DUNGEON CELL - RETURN TO SCENE

The eyes of LoGosh - the eyes of KING VARIAN WRYNN - wide in
revelation as he finally realizes who he truly is Thrall
releases him and he staggers backward a step in shock

Varians heart is pounding his mind racing as he begins to
piece together the fractured memories

VARIAN
I was returning home from
Kalimdor when we were attacked
I had just met with you to
discuss a treaty An armistice

THRALL

I remember it well I was just a
young chieftain and you a very
young king But we both saw what
was possible A chance for peace

(beat)
The Burning Legion saw Azeroths
future turning against them They
saw harmony between Orcs and
Humans All their plans undone And
so they intervened And set us back
on the course to war To where we
find ourselves now

VARIAN
How how did you know

THRALL
Much about you has changed since we
last met But your scent has not
An Orc’s sense of smell never lies

A resolute look comes over Varian He makes for the door

THRALL
Where are you going

VARIAN
To put an end to this

INT THERAMORE KEEP - CHAPEL - LATE AFTERNOON

Small and intimate Waning daylight shafts through the
stained-glass windows Jaina kneels at the altar on which
lies the body of Aegwynn draped in funeral robes

Varian appears in the doorway behind her

VARIAN
Im sorry

Jaina doesn’t turn wipes away a tear

JAINA
Maybe I was foolish to believe that
there could ever be peace Maybe it
was always going to end like this

VARIAN
I’m the one who was wrong I
wouldnt let myself see what you
saw here But now I do

Jaina stands turns to face him

JAINA
See what

VARIAN
Hope My father once said to me
once you choose hope anything is
possible And I choose it now

JAINA
Why should I believe you After
everything youve done

VARIAN
I’m not the man I used to be or
rather I am
(beat)

The attack today wasn’t the end
its just the beginning We have to
stop this thing before it’s too
late I need your help I need you
to trust me

He moves closer looks her deep in the eye And once again
there is that same electricity between them

VARIAN
Do you trust me

BEAT Jaina looks back at Aegwynn’s body resting on the
altar Then back at Varian As she makes a decision

INT THERAMORE KEEP - PROUDMOORE’S QUARTERS - EVENING

Proudmoore looks over a map of Kalimdor surrounded by senior
officers including STORMPIKE Tyrande is also here

Varian and Jaina enter Proudmoore sees them but does not
acknowledge them his attention focused on the map

PROUDMOORE
The Tauren were nowhere to be seen
today Clearly theres division
within the Horde Now we’ve got
them on the run it’s time to press
our advantage And counter-attack

Stormpike and the other officers exchange uneasy looks

STORMPIKE
Sir perhaps we ought to take a
moment to consider our-

PROUDMOORE
Every moment we waste allows them
time to regroup No we hit them
hard and we hit them now

Proudmoore indicates toward Durotar on the map

PROUDMOORE

Thrall gathered all the Orcish
clans under one banner In one
location He thought it would make
them strong But it’s going to be
their undoing

(beat)
We’re going to destroy Orgrimmar
Were going to kill every last one
of them Wipe them out once and for
all

More uncertain looks Jaina in particular is horrified

JAINA
Youre talking about genocide

PROUDMOORE

I’m talking about securing a future
for the peaceful races of this
world We didn’t go far enough in
the last war We drove the Orcs out
but we didn’t finish them off And
look where it got us Well we
wont make the same mistake again

STORMPIKE
Sir repelling today’s attack was
one thing But laying siege to
their capital

PROUDMOORE
This army is more than up to the
task And with the help of our new
allies how can we fail

TYRANDE
My people will have no further hand
in this And you must call off this
attack

PROUDMOORE
What

TYRANDE
Things are not as they seem Both
sides in this conflict are being
manipulated

PROUDMOORE
Manipulated By whom

TYRANDE
The Burning Legion

Proudmoore rolls his eyes incredulous

PROUDMOORE
This nonsense again

STORMPIKE
My grandfather was an archeologist
He uncovered some of the earliest
Titan relics He always believed
the Legion was real

TYRANDE
For my people it is not a matter of
belief Weve seen them We’ve
fought them before

PROUDMOORE
If this “Legion” is real why don’t
they show themselves Why not
simply attack us

JAINA
The Legion doesnt do its own dirty
work They sew hatred and discord
among others then watch as they
bring about their own destruction

TYRANDE
The Legion has destroyed countless
worlds in this way Make no mistake
- if you persist in this war you
will be paving the way for the
destruction of all Azeroth

PROUDMOORE

Im surrounded by lunatics

(to Tyrande)
I thank you and your people for
your assistance today but if you
have nothing further to offer than
ghost stories may I suggest you
get on your ships and return to
wherever you came from

TYRANDE
As you wish We will leave you to
your fate
(to Jaina)
I’m sorry

And with that she turns and sweeps out of the room

JAINA
Father listen to her Listen to-

PROUDMOORE
No I’ve heard enough I won’t let
this campaign be dictated by some
fairy tale Im in command here
And now Varian steps forward

VARIAN
Not any more

And suddenly every eye in the room is on him

PROUDMOORE
What did you say

VARIAN
Im relieving you of command
Effective immediately

Silence Everybody flummoxed by this To Proudmoore it
appears so surreal that he can’t help but be amused

PROUDMOORE
May I ask on whose authority

VARIAN
My own I am Varian Wrynn Rightful
King of Stormwind and High
Protector of the Alliance And
there will be no war under my rule

A tense BEAT Varian serious as a heart attack Nobody knows
how to react Jaina looks at Varian with astonishment And
then Proudmoore LAUGHS

PROUDMOORE
Have you lost your mind

VARIAN
No I’ve regained it

PROUDMOORE
Varian Wrynn is dead And taking
his name in vain is punishable by
death I could have you hanged

VARIAN
I remember you You advised my
father when I was a boy Look me in
the eyes and tell me you don’t see
his son

Proudmoore looks hard into Varians eyes Searching And for
the briefest moment there is a flicker of recognition

»»sbut he CONCEALS IT Shakes his head

PROUDMOORE
I see nothing

Proudmoore motions to the ALLIANCE GUARDS who have been
quietly taking up position behind Varian They SEIZE HIM

JAINA
Father You can’t do this

PROUDMOORE
Don’t tell me you actually believe
him

Jaina looks at Varian unsure

JAINA
I don’t know But I know he’s
right This war will be the end of
us all If youre going to lock him
up for saying it then you may as
well lock me up too

She glares at him defiantly Proudmoore considers
INT THERAMORE DUNGEON - CELL 2 - DAY

Varian and Jaina are tossed inside together Proudmoore
stands in the doorway

PROUDMOORE
Im sorry it had to come to this
But I never imagined I’d be
betrayed by my own blood

JAINA
Is this how you honor Derek and
Tandred By sending more brothers
and sons to their deaths

That touched a raw nerve with Proudmoore

PROUDMOORE
I‘1l honor them by keeping the
promise I made them After this
there’1l be no-one left to fight
One final sacrifice and then it is
done I don’t expect you to
understand that but they would
have

JAINA
No They’d be begging you not to do
this And youd be breaking their
hearts as well as mine
BEAT Proudmoore looks at Jaina with sadness

PROUDMOORE
Im sorry

He motions to the GUARD who slams the door closed
INT THERAMORE KEEP - PROUDMOORES QUARTERS - NIGHT
Proudmoore is back at his map table surrounded by Stormpike

and his other senior officers The officers adjust the
positions of miniatures representing ALLIANCE UNITS

ALLIANCE OFFICER
The first waves of infantry will
make landfall here and here to
establish a beach-head and clear a
path for the armor to come ashore

PROUDMOORE
Air support

ALLIANCE OFFICER
The carriers Turalyon and Prince
Arthas will launch simultaneous
bombing sorties against the Orcish
artillery positions We estimate-

Proudmoore nods as the briefing continues Stormpike watches
and listens in silence deeply troubled

INT THERAMORE DUNGEON - CELL 2 - NIGHT

Jaina paces agitated Varian scopes the cell for any sign of
possible escape But aside from the door the only exit is a
narrow barred window high above out of reach

JAINA
So that was your grand plan
Pretending to be a dead king

VARIAN
Its not a pretense

JAINA
Varian Wrynn’s ship went down with
all hands He was lost

VARIAN
Yes Until now

Theres something powerfully sincere in Varian’s eyes that
Jaina cant ignore Shes utterly vulnerable to it

VARIAN

My memory is returning slowly in
fragments But I remember you We
went to school together in
Stormwind Sometimes wed sneak out
of class and go to the park

(beat closer)
Thats where we first kissed

Jaina flushes red Still barely able to believe it

JAINA
I was a child I don’t remember

VARIAN
Then perhaps youll remember this

He pulls her close and KISSES HER Long deep and passionate
When he releases her shes weak at the knees - and it’s as
though a spell has been lifted She looks at him now with new
eyes as though really seeing him for the first time

We hear the CELL DOOR UNLOCKING Varian and Jaina separate
self-conscious as Stormpike enters

STORMPIKE

The Alliance fleet hits the Durotar
coast at dawn Proudmoore put me in
charge of the Seventh Expeditionary
Battalion Theyll be the first to
land on the beach first into
Orgrimmar That’s the unit that’ll
get all the glory

(beat)
I told him to shove his glory up
his arse Resigned my commission

Varian and Jaina exchange a hopeful look

VARIAN
Youll help us

STORMPIKE
I didn’t say that It’s one thing
to refuse an order from Proudmoore
quite another to go up against him
I could be executed for high
treason Id need a bloody good
reason to take that kind of risk

Stormpike seems to be scrutinizing Varian He approaches him
gesturing to one of many MEDALS on his breastplate

STORMPIKE
This is the Alliance Cross Awarded
to those wounded in combat I won
it at the Battle of Alterac Varian
Wrynn presented it to me himself
The only time I ever met him

(beat)

When he gave it to me he told me
something that Ive never shared
with anyone Something only the
King would remember

VARIAN
Its difficult I don’t remember
everything not yet

STORMPIKE
Youre gonna have to do better than
that lad

Stormpike heads back toward the door As suddenly Varian has
a sudden FLASH OF RECALL

VARIAN
As much pride as it gives me to
present you with this medal

Stormpike STOPS Looks back

VARIAN
I pray that it’s the last I’1l
ever have to

BEAT Stormpike walks back to Varian AND DROPS TO ONE KNEE
BEFORE HIM Head bowed

STORMPIKE
Long live the King

Varian looks a little awkward Though he knows he is King
it’s been a long time since anyone treated him like one

VARIAN
Rise

Stormpike rises to his feet

STORMPIKE
How is this possible

VARIAN
Therell be time for that later
Right now we need your help We’ve
got to stop Proudmoore

STORMPIKE
Proudmoore’s already left The bulk
ef the fleet with him

VARIAN
Can you get us out of here
STORMPIKE
Aye- uh what do I call ye Your
majesty
VARIAN

Let’s worry about that if I still
have a kingdom when this is over

EXT THERAMORE DUNGEON - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The cell door swings open The two posted guards react when
they see Varian and Jaina following Stormpike out

DUNGEON GUARD 1
Sir you can’t take these-

The first guard challenges Varian with the point of his
sword Varian effortless grabs his wrist and twists it into a
crippling armlock then fells him with a right hook

The second guard goes for his sword but Stormpike is on him
like a bulldog He PUNCHES HIM IN THE CODPIECE The guard
winces in pain and sinks to his knees - bringing him to eye-
level with Stormpike who finishes him off with a HEADBUTT

STORMPIKE
Used to be a bouncer at a Human bar
before I enlisted You learn a few
tricks C’mon

VARIAN
Wait This isn’t all of us

It takes a moment for Stormpike to realize who he means

STORMPIKE
Oh please tell me yer jokin’

INT THERAMORE DUNGEON - THRALL’S CELL - CONTINUOUS

Thrall down on his knees in the moonlit darkness Gathering
up small pieces of earth and straw from the dungeon floor
When he has enough he cups it in his hands and mutters a
SHAMANISTIC PRAYER under his breath

The dusty earth BEGINS TO GLOW Thrall blows on his hands and
the glowing particles float upward toward the narrow barred
window high above carried on an unseen current He watches
as they drift through the bars into the open air and gone

The cell door opens and Varian Jaina and Stormpike enter

VARIAN
Proudmoore took the fleet he’s
laying siege to Orgrimmar at dawn

A dark look comes over Thrall as he stands

THRALL
He sails to his own destruction
Orgrimmars defenses are far
greater than he thinks

VARIAN
Can you stop it

THRALL
I don’t know Perhaps If my people
can see me alive

VARIAN
We have to try Colonel

Varian motions to the heavy iron chains and manacles securing
Thrall to the cell wall Stormpike looks uncertain

STORMPIKE
I must be going out of my bloody
mind in my old age

Thrall holds his hands out before him And with a blow from
his sword Stormpike CUTS CLEAN THROUGH THE IRON CHAIN

Varian hands Thrall his mighty WAR MACE

VARIAN
This belongs to you

Thrall takes the hammer Looks at Varian with great respect

THRALL
Thank you

EXT THERAMORE KEEP - NIGHT

Varian Jaina Thrall and Stormpike emerge onto the street
At the sight of Thrall many townsfolk busy cleaning up after
the battle FLEE IN PANIC Thrall takes it in stride

VARIAN
This isn’t the work of one man

STORMPIKE
What isnt

VARIAN
This war Twisted as they are I
understand Proudmoore’s reasons for
wanting this But I was at the
council in Stormwind Prestor
Jonathan Jes-Tereth they were all
pushing Anduin down the same path

STORMPIKE
Prestor wants to be Queen It’s no
secret at court - everyone knows
it save the King himself

Stormpike stops looks at Varian gravely

STORMPIKE
Sire your son has tried his best
to rule in your absence But there
are many who perceive him as weak
He knows the Alliance can’t go to
war under a boy-king with no
experience of fighting one Hed be
forced to step aside By law of
succession Prestor would take the
throne And once she has it shell
never give it up That’s why she
sent Proudmoore here - she knew
there could only be one outcome

JAINA
These people would plunge us all
into war just to seize power

STORMPIKE
With respect M’lady I can see ye
haven’t spent much time around
politicians

Varian’s face flushes with anger

VARIAN
When I get back there

THRALL
We need transport to Orgrimmar We
must get there before the dawn

JAINA
What about the Night Elves

STORMPIKE
Their ships left before ours did
Back to Teldrassil
(looks around)
But I know just the thing

We follow Stormpike over to the GRYPHON ROOST where several
of the winged beasts are nesting To the GRYPHON MASTER

STORMPIKE
Alliance business I’m
commandeering these animals
Stormpike mounts up Varian looks apprehensive

VARIAN
Is there no other way

STORMPIKE
You wouldnt be afraid of a little
flyin’ would ye Ach don’t be
such a big girl’s blouse
Statistically speaking it’s the
safest way to travel

As Stormpike’s gryphon spreads its wings with a loud CAW
EXT MULGORE - NIGHT

A land of vast verdant grass plains and rolling hills A
place of outstanding untouched natural beauty As we pass
over the land we crest a hilltop to discover

THUNDER BLUFF

A great elevated city built atop a sprawling network of
TOWERING MESAS interconnected by a series of rope bridges
Animal-skin huts totemic statues temples and water wheels
We move in closer to one of the high mesas where we find
CAIRNE seated at its edge Meditating The great vista of
Mulgore’s rolling grasslands laid out before him

His eyes SNAP OPEN Suddenly acutely aware of something
The air before him seems to be alive with dimly glowing
particles carried toward him on the wind Fascinated he
reaches out and grabs a handful of them out of the air

He looks at the glowing particles in his hand Growing dimmer
by the moment like dying embers But Cairne is able to
divine the message within His eyes widen amazed

to bear on deck Gun crews loading adjusting elevation An
ALLIANCE COMMANDER approaches to report

ALLIANCE COMMANDER
Sir our carriers are within range

PROUDMOORE
Excellent Let’s start softening
them up shall we

The Commander nods to a SIGNALMAN who signals the trailing
fleet with a pair of SEMAPHORE FLAGS

AT THE REAR OF THE FLEET

As we move along the fleet we discover that not all the ships
are traditional mast-and-sail vessels To the rear there is a
pair of STEAM-POWERED AIRCRAFT CARRIERS of Gnomish design
They are the RSS TURALYON AND RSS PRINCE ARTHAS

PRINCE ARTHAS - FLIGHT DECK

Several GNOMISH ATTACK AIRCRAFT are assembled on deck Iron-
clad TWIN-ENGINE TURBOPROPS laden with bombs under the wings

A GNOMISH FLIGHT OPERATIONS OFFICER in a life-vest and

Cannon fire EXPLODES INTO ORGRIMMAR‘S WALLS showering rubble
onto fleeing Orcish civilians below

As he bellows the order a DARK SHADOW passes overhead
Accompanied by the FLAPPING OF GREAT LEATHERY WINGS

Proudmoore watches with satisfaction as the Alliance cannon
fire pummels Orgrimmar’s walls

Quite right sir

ALLIANCE SPOTTER (0S)
Incoming at twelve o’clock

Proudmoore looks up - to see DARK SHAPES pushing through he
clouds ahead Emerging to reveal

WYVERNS Great flying beasts saddled by ORCISH RIDERS HIGH
EXPLOSIVES strapped to the Wyverns’ bellies They emit BLOOD-
CURDLING SCREECHES as they close on the Alliance fleet

PROUDMOORE
Target those beasts

Alliance gun crews crank the elevation on their cannons and
OPEN FIRE on the incoming Wyverns One takes a direct hit and
EXPLODES A second is WINGED and careens out of control

SPIRALING DIRECTLY TOWARD AN ALLIANCE CARRIER Crewmen
scatter and leap overboard as the bomb-strapped Wyvern
CRASHES INTO THE DECK AND EXPLODES LIKE A KAMIKAZE PILOT

patrols before them on his ARMORED WOLF MOUNT holding a
BLOOD-RED WAR BANNER aloft as he addresses his troops

The assembled Ores reply with a defiant ROAR

Are you going to let these Human
maggots destroy your homes Make
slaves of your women and children

Another blood-curdling ROAR OF DEFIANCE

Then do as your blood commands you -—
and fight Victory or death

Dozens of Alliance infantrymen are massed on the foredeck
ready to hit the beach Proudmoore readies his sword There’s
an eager look in his eye He’s waited a long time for this
day And there’s nowhere in the world he would rather be

PROUDMOORE
Prepare for landing Advance up the
beach by twos standard formation

More artillery fire zips past and splashes down nearby Up
ahead the beach is fast approaching And atop the sloping
cliffs beyond Orgrimmar looms ominously a fortress

Proudmoore glances behind him at the men he commands Their
faces reminiscent of those men who hit the Normandy beaches
on D-Day Terrified - and very very young

The two armies are now just yards apart charging hell-bent
for each other They close the final few yards

»and CLASH with a force that shakes the very ground
Irresistible force meeting immovable object The front lines
hacking and slashing at one another in a bloody fury

spilling more Alliance troops onto the beach and into battle

AMPHIBIOUS LANDING CRAFT hit the beach BOWS OPENING INTO

Belching steam from their exhausts as they chug up the beach

Just as the Legion has planned

about its color as though it’s been slicked with oil Black
clouds cast a gloomy pall over the battlefield below

It’s not over yet I can still put
a stop to this

STORMPTIKE
Are you mad You and whose army

BEAT And then they hear a DEEP DISTANT RUMBLING Barely
perceptible at first but growing louder stronger as

OVER THE HORIZON TOWARD THEM a great cloud of dust pluming
in their wake CAIRNE AT THE HEAD OF THE ARMY LEADING THEM

EXT DUROTAR BEACH - BATTLEFIELD - DAY

The two armies continue to have at each other At the center
of the fray is GROMMASH swinging his war axe furiously
cleaving Alliance troops with bloody abandon

BEHIND THE ALLIANCE LINES

Proudmoore sees the carnage Grommash is causing the
Warchief’s frenzy firing up the Orcish troops around him and
threatening to break through the Alliance lines

Proudmoore draws his sword and RIDES INTO BATTLE The
Alliance lines parting before him to let him through

Grommash sees Proudmoore charging toward him at full gallop
Raises his axe and prepares to meet him - bring it on
Proudmoore draws back his sword and as he closes the distance
the two adversaries ROAR IN A BLOOD-FUELED RAGE

As Proudmoore’s horse rides past they CLASH WEAPONS in a
shower of steel sparks The force of the impact KNOCKING
GROMMASH TO THE GROUND AND DISMOUNTING PROUDMOORE

Proudmoore and Grommash get to their feet and face off
circling each other as the battle rages around them Eyes
burning with generations of hatred as they close in

and FIGHT Sword against axe in a jaw-dropping flurry of
violence Both men experienced expert fighters They clash
weapons again and again neither one giving any quarter

But it’s Grommash who has the advantage in size and strength
As the relentless melee continues Proudmoore begins to
weaken Forced to fight more and more defensively until a
final axe blow KNOCKS THE SWORD FROM HIS HANDS

Proudmoore staggers backward off-balance Grommash CHARGES
As Proudmoore scrambles to evade Grommash raises his axe and
is about to deliver the killing blow

when THE GROUND SHUDDERS UNDERFOOT An earthquake
Grommash glances to the horizon to see

THE TAUREN ARMY STAMPEDING DOWN THE HILLSIDE TOWARD THEM

GROMMASH
What

The Tauren warriors raise their shields and NARROW INTO AN
ARROWHEAD PHALANX as they charge toward the two armies

The Tauren phalanx PLOUGHS INTO THE MELEE at the point where
the two front lines meet - DRIVING BETWEEN THE TWO OPPOSING
ARMIES LIKE A WEDGE Using their shields to form an
IMPENETRABLE WALL that splits the two armies apart

through the center of the battle creating a buffer zone that
prevents the Orcs and Humans from engaging each other

VARIAN
Now

THRALL
Now

Thrall Varian Jaina and Stormpike mount up and ride off
down the hillside toward the battlefield

ORGRIMMAR RAMPARTS

GarThok’s eyes go wide with disbelief as he recognizes

GAR’ THOK
Thrall
(beat)
Cease fire Cease fire

The Orcish ballista crews STAND DOWN
LOWER BEACH

The ALLIANCE COMMANDER looks through his spyglass In HIS POV
we see Orgrimmars artillery cease firing PAN ACROSS THE
BATTLEFIELD to find our heroes riding down the hillside

ALLIANCE COMMANDER
What the hell
(beat)
All guns cease fire

The Alliance fleet’s cannons FALL SILENT
BATTLEFIELD FRONT LINE

As the shelling on both sides comes to and end an eerie calm
settles over the battlefield The two opposing armies
rendered neutral by the Tauren shield wall dividing them

AN ORC WARRIOR sees Thrall and the others riding toward them
Can barely believe what he sees But it’s unmistakable

ORC WARRIOR
Thrall lives

Another Ore spots it Then another And another Soon “Thrall
lives” is spreading through the Orcish ranks like a virus
Orcs straining for a view of their resurrected Warchief

The four riders arrive before the assembled mass of Orcs and
Humans Thrall pacing on his mount as he addresses them

THRALL
I am Thrall son of Durotan
Warchief of the Horde And I
command this army to stand down

BEAT The masses of Orcs exchange uncertain looks Thrall
motions to Varian and Jaina who are mounted at his side

THRALL
These Humans risked their own lives
to save mine To show us that there
is a path other than bloodshed for
our peoples

Grommash breaks through the Orcish ranks to address them

GROMMASH
Do not listen to him He was a
slave to the Humans before and now
he is once again He would lead us
all into subjugation and dishonor -
and I will not follow

Thrall dismounts to confront Grommash face-to-face

THRALL
Is that a challenge

BEAT Grommash and Thrall square off bristling Thrall looks
deep into Grommash’s eyes

THRALL
The Legion still holds you captive
I see it in your eyes They allow
you to see only hatred and fear
But I know you Grom You’re
stronger than that Break free of
them And stand with me brother

Thrall extends his hand Grommash struggles in anguish at
war with himself his soul in mortal agony

Grom hefts his axe and ATTACKS THRALL Thrall raises his mace
in defense WEAPONS CLASHING as Grommash surges forward in a
blind rage But Thrall is the better fighter - after parrying
several axe swings he DISARMS GROMMASH AND KNOCKS HIM DOWN
with a single devastating blow of his mace

Thrall stands over the defeated Grommash Looking down at him
not with anger or resentment but pity

The assembled Orcs watch in wide-eyed anticipation They know
what must come next Grommash looks up at Thrall

GROMMASH
All challenges are to the death

There is a sadness to the way in which he says it almost as
though he would welcome the release that death would bring

Thrall looks up at the expectant Ores
THRALL
With our choices we make the world
Shape it into what we would have it
be

Thrall TOSSES HIS WAR MACE INTO THE EARTH AT HIS FEET

THRALL
I make my choice here now And I
ask you to make yours

BEAT and then an ORC INFANTRYMAN steps forward and PLANTS
HIS SWORD INTO THE GROUND Others follow DROPPING THEIR
WEAPONS before Thrall THE ENTIRE ORC ARMY IS DISARMING

The Alliance troops cannot believe what they are seeing
Stunned by this unprecedented display Proudmoore pushes
through to the front of their ranks

PROUDMOORE
What are you all waiting for
Theyre unarmed

VARIAN
You heard what he said Therell be
no more blood spilled here today

PROUDMOORE
Im giving you men a direct order

But no-one moves Stormpike marches forward and CONFISCATES
PROUDMOORE’S SWORD

PROUDMOORE
What do you think you’re doing

STORMPIKE

Daelin Proudmoore under article
nine of the Alliance Code of
Military Conduct I hereby relieve
you of your command

(to the troops)
Start loading the ships lads
Were going home

PROUDMOORE
Ill see you hang for this

STORMPIKE
Well let the council decide that
Along with the charges youll face
of gross dereliction of duty and
reckless endangerment of the troops
under your command Now get yer
sorry arse off this beach

TWO ALLIANCE SOLDIERS take Proudmoore by the arms and escort
him away Varian slaps Stormpike on the back

VARIAN
When we get home remind me to
promote you

STORMPIKE
Oh don’t worry I will

Varian looks back and smiles at Jaina She smiles back
relieved Triumphant But then the SKIES ABOVE DARKEN

All look up to see the clouds overhead seethe and roil

crackling with a strange energy like a malevolent lightning
storm Something unnatural about it Something sinister Is
it just us or can we almost see a DEMONIC FACE within them

VARIAN
Now what

STORMPIKE
I think somebody up there doesn’t
like us

LIGHTNING ARCS DOWN FROM THE SKY AND STRIKES THE EARTH Bolts
of powerful energy scorching the ground killing men where
they stand PANIC BREAKS OUT as Human and Orc alike flee

A lightning strike creates a SNAKING FISSURE ALONG THE BEACH
The earth quaking as it widens into a IMPASSABLE RIFT
Soldiers unable to avoid its path TUMBLE INTO THE CHASM

By the time the earth settles the fissure has effectively
SPLIT THE BEACH IN TWO separating Varian Jaina and Thrall
from the Alliance and Horde armies

And now something is coming at us out of the sky breaking
through the clouds burning with green fire

A GIANT METEOR Varian pulls Jaina clear as it PLOUGHS INTO
THE EARTH throwing up tons of sand and rock and knocking
everyone clean off their feet

An ominous BEAT And then SOMETHING EMERGES from the huge
impact crater gouged from the beach

A GIANT DEMON LORD Rising to FIFTY FEET sporting the horns
of a ram leathery bat-like wings and the tail of a lizard
An abomination it towers over the battlefield carrying a
GREAT IRON SPEAR its tip burning with demonic fire

The Alliance and Horde forces FLEE IN TERROR at the sight of
this nightmarish leviathan

Varian Thrall and Jaina stand in the demon’s shadow

THRALL
Mannoroth

VARIAN
You know him

THRALL
Arch-Lieutenant of the Legion Sent
only when all else fails

Thrall picks up his war mace from the ground

THRALL
He‘s mine

JAINA
This is what I was trained for

THRALL
Then we’ll do it together

They go forward as one Mannoroth looks down at them eyes
ablaze with hellfire When he speaks his booming voice
echoes across the battlefield rattling our spines

MANNOROTH
PITIFUL MORTALS DO YOU THINK
YOU HAVE DEFEATED US

THRALL
Look around you demon You’ve
failed Leave this world or die

Mannoroth LAUGHS Terrible blood-curdling And DRIVES THE
HEAD OF HIS SPEAR INTO THE GROUND Charging the earth with
glowing demonic energy The earth RUMBLES soil churning

as BURNING MONSTROSITIES RISE UP FROM WITHIN Featureless
mindless golems of earth and rock bound together by
Mannoroth’s demonic magic INFERNALS

Varian draws his sword Stands side by side with Thrall

VARIAN
Loktar Ogar

THRALL
Victory or death

And with that THEY CHARGE INTO BATTLE
Thrall swings his hammer SHATTERING THE FIRST INFERNAL INTO

LUMPS OF SMOULDERING ROCK Varian fights at his side slicing
through the burning monsters with his sword

Behind them Jaina clenches her fists which CRACKLE WITH
MAGIC As an infernal stomps toward her she unleashes an ICY
BOLT OF FROST THAT SLICES THROUGH ITS BURNING CORE LIKE AN
ARROW It crumbles into a pile of stone and earth

Our three heroes cut their way through the infernals with
steel and magic But there are simply too many As Jaina
destroys an infernal with a frostbolt ANOTHER LOOMS BEHIND
HER Poised to strike Varian sees it before she does

VARIAN
Jaina

Jaina turns as the infernal comes down with its great earthen
fist With only a split-second to react Jaina casts a spell
ENCASING HERSELF WITHIN A PROTECTIVE BLOCK OF ICE

The infernal pounds against the ice gouging great shards
from it Varian rushes to help but before he can get there a
MAGICAL ARROW PIERCES THE INFERNAL’S CORE FROM BEHIND A
BEAT and then the INFERNAL EXPLODES into lifeless rock

TYRANDE SHIMMERS INTO VIEW FROM OUT OF THIN AIR “UN-
STEALTHING” clutching her bow

Jaina’s ice block DISSIPATES leaving her shivering in a
puddle of water Varian helps her to her feet

TYRANDE
I do so hate it when Im right

JAINA
you stayed

TYRANDE
We could not allow one man’s
arrogance to doom this world

VARIAN
We

THE NIGHT ELF FORCES “UN-STEALTH” INTO VIEW BEHIND TYRANDE
Dozens of elite warriors armed and ready for battle

TYRANDE
We will handle the infernals Take
the demon Go now

ON THRALL as he battles the infernals Swinging with his
mace smashing one after an other But still they come He’s
tiring the infernals threatening to overwhelm him

-when the NIGHT ELVES SWARM INTO THE FRAY Smashing their
way through the infernals with jaw-dropping agility and
skill Mannoroth’s face falls as he sees the battle turning

MANNOROTH
KALDOREI

Mannoroth goes into a rage Storming forward as Thrall
Varian and Jaina rush to meet him head-on Jaina lets loose
with a DEVASTATING VOLLEY OF MAGIC forcing him back

JAINA
Aim for its heart

Varian whirls like a discus thrower and HURLS HIS SWORD AT
MANNOROTH’S CHEST Mannoroth deflects it with a swipe of his
hand the sword pinwheeling harmlessly away

But the distraction creates an opening for Thrall who
charges up a rockpile of shattered infernals and LEAPS AT
MANNOROTH HAMMER POISED OVERHEAD TO STRIKE Thrall bellows a
WAR CRY and Mannoroth turns wide-eyed with alarm as Thrall
brings down his hammer toward the demon‘s chest

A BLINDING SHOCKWAVE KNOCKS VARIAN AND JAINA OFF THEIR FEET
Thrall lies on the ground before Mannoroth Looks up to see

HIS MACE EMBEDDED IN ONE OF MANNOROTHS WINGS Enveloped
protectively around him

Mannoroth opens his wings shaking them to free Thrall’s
mace which falls to the ground DEMONIC BLOOD oozes from the
wound But to Mannoroth it’s just a scratch He smiles

MANNOROTH
A WORTHY EFFORT BUT FUTILE

Mannoroth closes in on our helpless heroes His shadow
looming over them the demon SPREADS HIS WINGS WIDE IN
TRIUMPH grinning archly as he goes in for the kill

»»eand then SUDDENLY STOPS A look of surprise on his face
He looks down

to see a WAR AXE IMBEDDED IN HIS EXPOSED CHEST Thrall and
the others look behind them to see

GROMMASH Glaring at the demon with defiance

Mannoroth sinks to his knees mortally wounded Blood seeping
from the axe wound He grasps at his chest trying to pull it
out But Grommash CHARGES FORWARD BARRELING INTO MANNOROTH
AND SENDING HIM CRASHING ONTO HIS BACK

As Mannoroth flounders helplessly Grommash climbs up onto
his chest glaring into the wounded demons eyes Mannoroth
looks back at him with pure unbridled hatred Spitting

MANNOROTH
YOU DARE DEFY US MAGGOT YOUR
LIFE YOUR VERY BLOOD BELONGS TO
US AS DOES YOUR WHOLE
MISBEGOTTEN RACE

GROMMASH
Not any more

And with that he grabs the axe handle with both hands and
PLUNGES IT DEEP INTO MANNOROTH’S HEART

As Mannoroth emits a SICKENING SHRILL DEATH RATTLE he ERUPTS
IN DEMONIC FLAME His entire body IMMOLATING Grommash makes
one final plunge with the axe as the searing fire consumes
both him and Mannoroth

THRALL
Grom

As the Night Elf warriors finish off the last of the
infernals Thrall Varian and Jaina rush to Mannoroth’s
burning corpse The fire already burning out leaving behind
only the demon’s charred and crumbling skeleton

And at its center lies Grommash Horrifically burned skin
charred black But still alive And still clutching his axe

Thrall rushes to his side Grom’s eyes flicker open

GROMMASH
Is is it done

Thrall nods Overwhelmed with emotion

THRALL
Yes

GROMMASH
You were right You were right
about me About all of us

A tear rolls down Thrall’s cheek Grommash reaches up and
clasps Thrall’s hand in his A warrior’s bond

GROMMASH
You will always be my brother

Grom’s axe slips out of his hand and to the ground And with
that he dies Thrall lowers his head and quietly weeps

PULL OUT over the devastated battlefield as we DISSOLVE TO
EXT STORMWIND CITY - DAY

The Alliance fleet docked in the harbor

INT STORMWIND KEEP - THRONE ROOM - DAY

Varian stands alone in the grand chamber Examining the
PAINTING of himself as a young King that hangs on the wall
The likeness barely recognizable as the man he now is

His eyes turn to the throne Empty As though it has been
waiting for him to return all this time

KING ANDUIN WRYNN (0S)
Colonel Stormpike said you wanted
to see me

Varian turns to see Anduin Wrynn enter and cross the chamber
toward him He looks at him with different eyes now No
longer just the King of Stormwind His son

KING ANDUIN WRYNN
Youll have to forgive me It’s
Lo’Gosh isnt it

VARIAN
Your Highness there’s something I
have to tell you

KING ANDUIN WRYNN
If it’s about what happened in
Kalimdor I’ve already received
full reports from Colonel Stormpike
and Lady Proudmoore

VARIAN
They didnt tell you everything

KING ANDUIN WRYNN
Oh

BEAT Varian steps closer and looks into his sons eyes
Struggling with how to tell him Wondering if he even can

VARIAN
You are your father’s son His
strength is in you And though you
may not know it he still watches
over you And he wants you to make
him proud

(beat) (MORE)

VARIAN (CONTD)
I just thought you should know
that

Varian turns and walks away leaving Anduin to think about
that The young King looks puzzled as he watches Varian
leave then looks up at his father’s portrait on the wall

INT STORMWIND KEEP - WAR ROOM - DAY

The Alliance council is assembled here Among them Lady
Katrana Prestor Jonathan Marcus Admiral Jes-Tereth
Stormpike and Varian look on

Anduin Wrynn enters accompanied by the usual fanfare
Everyone stands and genuflects as per normal procedure

LADY KATRANA PRESTOR
Your majesty

KING ANDUIN WRYNN
Remain standing

Prestor and the others are a little surprised by this This
is not normal procedure

KING ANDUIN WRYNN
I apologize for the short notice
I’ve convened this meeting to
discuss the recent events in
Kalimdor

ADMIRAL JES-TERETH
A most unpleasant business sire
Rest assured Admiral Proudmoore
will stand trial for his crimes

KING ANDUIN WRYNN
Well I’m sure it will be of some
comfort to him to know that when he
does he won’t be alone

MARCUS JONATHAN
your majesty

KING ANDUIN WRYNN
I’ve received evidence which
strongly suggests that certain
senior council members conspired to
engineer this war for their own
ends I regret that I was weak
enough to allow them to manipulate
me against my own judgment
Stormwind has been without a King
for too long That ends today

(MORE)

KING ANDUIN WRYNN (CONTD)
(beat)
Lady Prestor you are hereby
charged with conspiracy and high
treason against the crown Likewise
Commander Jonathan and Admiral Jes-
Tereth

Anduin motions to his GUARDS who take Prestor Jonathan and
Jes-Tereth by the arms to lead them away

LADY KATRANA PRESTOR
This is an outrage This is-

Anduin cuts her off with a withering glare

KING ANDUIN WRYNN
Speak again and I swear I will
forego the formality of a trial

Everyone is stunned This is not the Anduin Wrynn they knew
This is a King reborn From the corner of the room Varian
looks at his son with immeasurable pride

As Prestor and the others are hauled away

KING ANDUIN WRYNN
Colonel Stormpike In recognition
of your unwavering courage in this
affair you are hereby promoted and
appointed my chief military
advisor Well done General

STORMPIKE
Thank you yer majesty

Stormpike glances back at Varian who winks at him

KING ANDUIN WRYNN
I‘1l1 make further pronouncements
concerning replacements for Prestor
and the others in due time This
council is adjourned

The council breaks up As Anduin exits he takes a moment to
look back at Varian Varian nods at him with a smile

STORMPIKE
You didn’t tell him
(beat)
So what’re you gonna do

INT THERAMORE KEEP - JAINA’S CHAMBERS - DAY

Jaina and Thrall are in conference around a map showing
Theramore Durotar and the lands in between

JAINA
Your people will accept this new
border These trade routes

THRALL
(nods)
It’s a beginning

VARIAN (0S)
The first of many

They turn to see Varian in the doorway Jaina is stunned

JAINA
What are you doing here Youre
supposed to be in Stormwind

VARIAN
I was Now I’m back

JAINA
I dont understand You’re the
rightful King You should be-

VARIAN
Stormwind already has a King And a
fine one he’s going to make His
place is on that throne

He looks at her lovingly

VARIAN
«-jJust as mine is here With you

THRALL
We have a lot work ahead of us

VARIAN
Then let’s begin

EXT THERAMORE ISLE - DAWN

Varian Thrall and Jaina stand atop a hillside overlooking
Theramore and the wild untamed lands of Kalimdor beyond

JAINA (V0)
And so begins a new age An era of
fragile truce between Orcs and
Humans An era of peace

They watch together as the SUN RISES over the horizon

JAINA (V0)
No-one can know when the Burning
Legion may return So we watch And
wait For the Legion is eternal
And so too must be our vigilance

Varians hand slips into Jaina’s She smiles
JAINA (V0)
One day the drums of war will
thunder once again But for now
the new dawn brings with it hope

The three of them stand in silhouette against the rising sun
as it bathes the land in its glow And as we FADE OUT

JAINA (V0)
Always hope

THE END
