EXT CITY STREETS (LOS ANGELES) - NIGHT
CREDIT SEQUENCE

As OPENING CREDITS play we study the citys nighttime
pulse ribbons of headlights moving and cross-connecting
like blood through the veins of a body --
impressionistic even beautiful but what were hearing
is soulful trumpet-based MUSIC mellow and haunting the
modern classic -- JAZZ sound of a Wynton Marsalis
putting a voice to our story As CREDITS END we

DISSOLVE TO

POV - EXT FREEWAY - NIGHT

Now the MUSIC is GONE SOUNDS are MUFFLED and vision
blurred We get the impression of urgent movement We
hear BREATHING There are VOICES SHOUTS even SCREAMS
but MUFFLED far away Only the breathing is distinct

We come to realize it is our breathing and we are inside
someone looking out The man whose POV this is is on

the edge of consciousness and not far from death He

lies on the pavement of a freeway at the site of an
accident only minutes after impact

His VISION goes IN and OUT of clarity People are
swarming around him and rushing by toward the carnage of
wrecked vehicles A SIREN BLOOMS in the distance and
approaches haltingly The man slips away comes back
toward consciousness slips again

The crowd around the downed man parts to allow passage to
a police officer It is a woman Officer SHARON POGUE
LAPD She kneels at the mans side taking charge
speaking but we hear only SLIVERS of SOUND He sees her
face clearly now close above him

Sharon is a dedicated professional and more We see down
into her to a place of real caring She stares into our
eyes and connects We begin to hear her now -- and there
are more SIRENS converging in bg

SHARON
Can you hear me
(shouting off)
This ones conscious

VOICE (0S)
Paramedics on the way

We are slipping away again Sharon holds us with her
eyes and she grips our hand

SHARON
Wait Wait Listen to me Can
you feel that
She holds on tight We see that our hand held in her
own is bloody
SHARON
Thats my hand Hold it Go on

-- as hard as you can

We watch our hand gripping hers and as we hold on the
sights and sounds around us grow more clear

SHARON
Its over and Ive got you and
youre safe Youre safe now
You got that Dont let go
Dont let me go

But our eyes unlock from Sharons and DRIFT TO a patch of
night sky Her voice fades awawy Our POV begins TO

LIFT MOVING TOWARD that sky as the blue-black night
begins to turn white We GO INTO that white light and

DISSOLVE TO

EXT LOS ANGELES CITYSCAPE - DAY

We PICK OUT a police car from the traffic and FOLLOW
The beat being patrolled is a mixed neighborhood with
some very rough edges

INT POLICE CAR - DAY

Officer Sharon Pogue is driving the car It is two years
since we saw her at the accident site Her partner

ROBBY LEWIS sips coffee and keeps one eye on the CAD
monitor which lists all area police calls She slows
behind a car that is crawling along an old 60s car
driven by a young man and woman who sit very close on the
bench seat The cars ENGINE is MISSING and smoking

SHARON
That car is older than they are

ROBBY
67 Chevy Impala

SHARON
Thats what I said

ROBBY
Needs a servicing

SHARON
Dont we all

Robby nearly spits his coffee laughing at what Sharon
has said and trying not to choke Sharon smiles shaking
her head

SHARON
Get it together officer

As Robby smiles Sharon looks ahead at the young couple
who each have an arm around the other She is stroking
his neck He is making gentle circles in her hair
Sharon watches this and for a moment her eyes reveal a
depth that may be loneliness but she quickly pushes her
thoughts away and hits the HORN startling Robby and
startling the people ahead who now disengage and drive
on

ROBBY
Jesus Pogo Almost spilled my
coffee again You didnt like his
hair or what
SHARON
I love Elvis hair They were
going two damn miles an hour

But Robbys eyes have caught something on the monitor

ROBBY
Lets roll to this -- fight in
progress

As Robby secures that coffee cup Sharon hits the SIREN
and speeds around the car in front of them

EXT CITY STREET - DAY

At the same time a few blocks away an OLD FRAIL MAN is
carrying two plastic grocery bags that are too heavy for
him

Walking behind this man is a younger man named CATCH
LAMBERT an attractive man with some scarring on his
face His eyes deep down are haunted by something but
there is energy in his step He is dressed in a relaxed
and stylish manner not expensive He begins to pick up
his pace to catch up to the old man

People glance at Catch nad he glances back in an open
and unflinching way ready for anything a smile a nod
or -- because these are some of LAs mean streets -- a
threatening or taunting look These he also meets
openly without a trace of fear The man has been
through some kind of fire and it has left him different
from us Outside the usual boundaries

Catch walks beside the Old Man glancing at him
Finally the man glances back wondering and suspicious
but Catch has a slight disarming smile open and honest

CATCH
Yknow since were both walking
the same way I could take one of
those bags for you That way I
do some upper body work while Im
walking along Helps my back
What dyou say

The Old Man trudges on proud and suspicious too

CATCH
Right now your minds making
pictures of me robbing your
groceires but yknow nine times
out of ten people do the right
thing

The Old Man glances at him still not convinced but he
soon has to stop and rest Catch stops too The old
man looks at him a bit embarrassed

OLD MAN
Its the dog food that makes it so
heavy

Catch nods puts out his hand The Old Man hesitates
then decides and lifts a bag and Catch takes it

CATCH
I guess its worth it fora
good dog

Catch isnt kidding He has that honesty The Old Man
nods and starts trudging again As they walk on
together Catch reaches for that second bag The man
relents and lets him take it They continue on Catch
carrying the bags and every now and then lifting them a
bit for his upper body work

EXT VIDEO GAME ROOM - DAY

This is the call Sharon and Robby have sped to It is a
chaotic scene of cops breaking up a fight between eight
boys 16-20 A big KID 18 or so is being pulled off
another by Sharon and Robby The Kid is wild and
resisting and Sharon shows her toughness and
professionalism and some anger too as she slams him

into a fence -- and Robby holds him while she cuffs the
young man -- who is very mouthy playing to his friends
KID
Look at this bitch Whoo Benny

look at this

Sharon and Robby are both very good at their jobs taking
this Kid to their car while other cops contain the rest

A crowd watches -- mostly teens
KID
(to Sharon)
You come in with me Hey bitch

Some of his bystanders friends howl at that

KID
Youre going to arrest me you
come into the back seat with me
Come on

He resists a bit but theyre getting him into the car
KID
Come on Well have a good time
INT POLICE CAR - DAY (FEW MINUTES LATER)

Sharons on the radio to dispatch as Robby drives and the
Kid keeps mouthing off

SHARON
(to radio)
Three Adam Five -- show us 1019 to

the jail with one male prisoner

KID
Take off your uniform Take off
my handcuffs bitch and come back
here I want one touch

ROBBY
Give it a rest

Sharon is stone-faced through this

KID
If youre going to put me away
you gotta give me one sweet touch

INT JAIL BOOKING AREA - DAY

As Robby and Sharon bring their suspect to the booking
counter each holding one of his cuffed arms The Kid is
looking at Sharons hand on his arm

KID
That aint the touch That aint
the touch I want

They get him to the counter
ROBBY

As I remove your cuffs I want you
to put your hands here Spread
your legs More

As they remove the cuffs the Kid makes a sudden move
toward Sharon reaching between her legs -- but she was
not only ready for this but hoping for it -- and the
stoniness of her face cracks into fierce anger as she
moves quickly and grabs the Kid by the hair bringing his
face into her upraised knee He cries out and goes down
on his knees hurting and bleeding The jailer rushes
over to help but Robby grabs the Kids wrists

ROBBY
Thats it Back off John we got
it
Robby glances at Sharon -- a dark glance

EXT POLICE JAIL PARKING LOT - DAY (LATER)

as Robby and Sharon walk to their car They are
interrupted by one of their lieutenants SANDERMAN
walking their way and stopping to stare at Sharon She
meets his look

SANDERMAN
You trying to be a bad-ass Pogue

She is straightforward not rebellious

SHARON
I just dealt with the situation
The prisoner

SANDERMAN
And you dont see a pattern here
(pause)
I want you to keep yourself way
inside the line instead of walking
on it All right Are you taking
notes

He walks away and Sharon and Robby walk on to their
car -- she is dark he is glancing at her

ROBBY
You broke his nose

SHARON
He grabbed me End of story
ROBBY
And you were waiting for him You
were hoping You were making
long-range plans for his ass while
he was mouthing off in the car --
and youre supposed to be above
that shit

SHARON
If you think I crossed the line
put it in the report

ROBBY
Pogo stop the shit What is it
You pissed off at me too

They enter the car Sharon behind the wheel

SHARON
Not you Rob Youre a rare
unthreatened male cop with a good
marriage and you like to eat
where I eat -- so everythings
code four

She STARTS the CAR and starts to back out and he reaches
over and turns OFF the IGNITION She stares hotly at

him -- but then slowly she softens takes a deep
breath
ROBBY

Come over for dinner tonight

Ill call Charlene Shed like to

see you Its been awhile Well

She STARTS the CAR again more calm starts to drive out
of the lot

SHARON
Thanks But shell invite
friends try and fix me up Shes
always trying to fix me up so she
doesnt have to worry about you
and me

ROBBY
She doesnt worry about that
SHARON
They all worry about that

They both smile wryly driving on

SHARON
You dont need to fix me Robby
or fix me up I dont want some
guy to heart and soul me and then
walk away cause he cant stand
the cop thing -- or worse he
wants cop stories every night
cause it turns him on and he has
no idea who I am inside my head
Anyway Im busy tonight

ROBBY
Got some action huh Well
thats promising

SHARON
Yeah Hot and heavy

IMMEDIATE CUT TO

INT SHARONS APARTMENT - NIGHT

She is on the floor using an exercise rig sliding into
crunches pushing herself sweating alone We BEGIN
DRIFTING TO the rain-spattered window as night sounds
filter in HORNS SOMEONE SHOUTING a CAR MOVING BY with
THUNDEROUS BASS MUSIC that pulses the very air and
RATTLES the LOOSE GLASS of her window

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT
Catch Lambert is walking the wet streets head down in
the rain Far away we hear that car with a BASS-BLASTING
RADIO

In the glow of a street lamp Catch sees a bright-colored
object in the gutter He picks it up out of the gurgling
rain water It is a small toy a discarded superhero
He puts it in his pocket walks on
Now the car the prowling MUSIC-BLASTING BASS-

THUNDERING CAR turns a corner and begins rollling along
slowly -- beside Catch He glances over walking on
There are four tough-looking MEN in the car looking for
trouble The MUSIC is DEAFENING Catch glances again
walks on Their eyes follow him like gun barrels He
stops and walks out on the street moving toward the car
shouting over the music

CATCH
Hey You want to turn that volume
down Whats your point

The men incredulous stop the car and snap OFF the MUSIC
in order to make sure theyre hearing right They stare
death at Catch

DRIVER (MAN)
What did you say

CATCH
Whats the point of blasting your
music through the whole zip code
Dont you realize there are kids
trying to sleep in these
apartments -- old people sick
people

They can hardly believe this

DRIVER
You better watch your mouth
asshole

Catch meets the mans look with his own unflinching
haunted eyes

CATCH
Why Whatre you gonna do Kill
me

Catchs look is not a macho challenge Its something
else -- beyond that a man somehow without limits One
of the riders in the backseat taps the Drivers shoulder

MAN 2
Guys nuts Lets go

The Driver never breaking his death stare snaps on the
DEAFENING MUSIC and then slowly rolls on still glaring
at Catch Catch stands in the rain watching them go

INT CATCHS APARTMENT CORRIDOR - SAME NIGHT

Catch is arriving home soaking wet He lives ina
slightly-seedy three-story As he walks down the
corridor toward his apaprtment he passes a neighbors
door and notices a set of keys dangling from the lock
He pauses -- and then knocks softly on the door

Someone looks through the peephole and then opens the
door -- a young single mother friendly but with a little
caution too She recognizes Catch Behind her is a
little boy (five) The womans name is CANDACE Her

son is TOMMY

CANDACE
Hi
CATCH
Hi Your keys are in the

He gestures and she sees the keys and retrieves them
more friendly now

CANDACE
Oh thank you Thanks a lot
God I was trying to carry Tommy
and all these bags He was so
tired Of course as soon as I
put him down he had all this
energy

While she is talking Catch is staring deeply at the boy
who is shy Catch almost speaks to the boy wants to
goes halfway to a smile -- but the sight of the kid stirs
that layer of darkness in Catch He nods a good-bye to
the mother and is about to go She thinks about this as
he is turning and pushes through her remaining caution
to say

CANDACE
Yknow we were just baking
nectarine bars because the peaches
werent ripe Ever had a
nectarine bar

He smiles and seems to want to stay but he is already

retreating His contact goes only so far -- and no
further
CATCH
Sorry Gotta be going

And with one more glance at the boy he walks to his
apartment unlocks it and steps in

INT CATCHS APARTMENT - NIGHT

He walks into a bare living room -- no chairs tables
lamps nothing on the walls He walks into a spotless
never-used kitchen and flips on the light opens a
drawer

In the drawer is a collection of kids toys some found
some purchased mostly plastic figures The action of
opening the door has started some battery-operated
animals moving around in there Now from his pocket he
takes the plastic superhero he just found and drops it in
and closes the drawer

He walks back into the living room He sits on the
floor leans back against the wall his clothes still
soaked from the rain He stares at his thoughts looking
a bit numb -- and lost

EXTINT DRY CLEANERS SHOP - DAY

replaced by an old pain and darkness

a sign marked POGUE CONSTRUCTION Sharon exits the car
and walks onto the site moves toward a man who is both

We WATCH moms and kids and a basketball game in the park
and PICK UP Catch walking by Two pre-teens are playing
bounce and catch with a rubber ball against a (tennis
practice) wall and one of them misses and Catch makes a
lunge and snags the ball Instead of throwing it to one
of the boys he fires it at the wall

One of the boys catches it bounces it off the wall
toward Catch Catch grabs it and now hes part of this
rapid-fire game -- and hes athletic and funny too
playing hard and mugging and making them smile until a

She puts out her hand He stares at that hand for just
half a beat before taking it They shake The feel of
her hand holding his evokes the memory of the accident
but he covers this

SHARON
You look familiar

CATCH
I guess I live on the beat you
patrol

Her way to cover nervousness is to be blunt even tough

SHARON
Why would you do that -- jump a
man with a gun

CATCH
(shrugs)
He was going to shoot you

SHARON
He couldve shot you You have a
death wish You a bungee jumper

CATCH
No I didnt have time to think
about it

SHARON

What dyou think about it now

CATCH
I figure it was worth the risk

SHARON
For someone you dont even know
CATCH
Yeah -- and for what you do I
think cops are great Out there
trying to keep it safe You know
Tough job Firemen are
everybodys heroes Kids wave at
firemen People should wave at
cops Did you ever think about
how many people are walking around
this town because you saved them

SHARON
I never thought about it

CATCH
because you helped them or
because you arrested somebody who
wouldve hurt them or because you
just did your job

SHARON
Now Im walking around this town
because of you Ever think about
that Maybe you should be a cop

He has made her smile

CATCH

SHARON

CATCH

SHARON
Bullshit

CATCH
No Really I just remembered it

SHARON
Not in here Its mostly cops

Now she has made him smile the first real smile weve
seen from Catch Its open and real and she is charmed
by it

SHARON
You have a nice smile

Shes a bit self-conscious saying that and just as she
says it the waitress arrives with shots and beers for
both of them Sharon looks up questioning and the
waitress nods toward the booth Catch and Sharon see the
cops staring smiling raising their glasses There is
a hint of teasing in their grins And now Sharon is more
self-conscious and a bit tough again taking her drink
and turning back to Catch

SHARON
So what were we talking about
Oh yeah you were giving me some
line about starting a
conversation

CATCH
The shortcut
SHARON

Okay Ill play
They clink glasses and drink Then
SHARON

Tomorrow Ive got a night watch

SHARON

CATCH
Oh Ill walk you to your car
and turns to Ray
CATCH

Thanks for the drink

RAY
Least we could do We dont like
her very much -- but we dont want

Sharon frowns and waves to the booth of cops
and shakes hands with Catch as a good-bye

Ray smiles

CATCH
Take care

And Catch and Sharon leave

EXT BAR - NIGHT

As Catch and Sharon exit the building walk toward her
car

SHARON
Its not a great neighborhood

CATCH
I dont have a car

They walk on silent a moment This doesnt come easy
for her

SHARON

CATCH

Oh thanks but I like to walk

He hesitates nervous about it but then

CATCH
Yeah If its no trouble

They walk to her car
SHARON
Okay ten years from now what

dyou want to be doing

They walk side by side a moment He shrugs Then -- in
his open way

CATCH
I dont know This is pretty
good

She glances at him taking this in then fumbles a bit
with her car keys and he asks -- nervously again

CATCH
Can you drive okay

She gets a little defensive

SHARON
Im not drunk You think Im
drunk Im not Youll know Im
drunk when Im throwing up and I
never throw up so dont worry
about it

He nods looks at her dead-on a moment

CATCH
The only time I worry is when
people tell me not to worry

SHARON
Get in the car will you

INT CAR - NIGHT
As they get in and she STARTS the ENGINE

CATCH
Im on Lundy Street just off
Pico

They drive a while She notices his anxiety He grips
the armrest when she speeds up

SHARON
Im good at this

CATCH
Streets are wet

SHARON
Are you one of those people who
drive ten miles an hour in the
rain I hate that

CATCH
I never drive

She glances at him and he notices her glance

CATCH
Ill be alright

Hes forcing himself to relax He takes a deep breath
sitting back in his seat He watches her as she drives
After a moment

CATCH
Yknow I can picture you in
Colorado

SHARON

Oh yeah What am I doing there

CATCH
Driving around pissed off

She smiles in spite of herself slows down

SHARON
Im not pissed off at you

CATCH
Give me some time

Now she laughs She drives not to his building but to
her own street She parks takes a deep breath This
sounds a bit hard-bitten because shes using her
toughness to cover

SHARON
Those guys in the bar are my
friends -- sort of We work
together we tell jokes and we
bullshit but I cant say to
them

She halts

CATCH

What

She says this clipped and fast and even tougher

SHARON
Every time I close my eyes I see
that goddamn gun pointing at me
and I dont know why Im telling
you unless its because you were
there and because I had three
drinks but Im not ready to go

inside and close my eyes and I
dont want to go to your place and
I dont want to keep driving
around so what the hell do we do

CATCH
Whew I feel like were boxing
and youve got me on the ropes
(pause)
Well do whatever you want

SHARON
What I want is to know how you
happened to be walking by that
parking lot at that minute What
if you hadn t been there

For a moment she shows her fear

CATCH
I guess we were supposed to meet

They stare a while then she opens her door

SHARON
If you want -- you can come in for
a minute

INT SHARONS APARTMENT - NIGHT
As they walk in she moves into the kitchen

SHARON
Want a drink

CATCH
No thanks

She pours one for herself while he looks about Its a
stiff drink Now that hes here her I-dont-want-to-
make-a-fool-of-myself alarm is on She flops on the
sofa watches him

SHARON
Sit down or something

CATCH
Im circling awhile
Hes looking around at the clutter of her life
intimate details

SHARON
Youre not supposed to look
around I didnt have time to
straighten up

CATCH
So its more real this way
SHARON
Its rude
He turns to her
CATCH
Now that Im in here you seem mad
about it
SHARON

Im not mad Youll know when Im
mad I dont usually let somebody
in here but here you are Thats
all Lets talk about something
stupid

CATCH
You first

She smiles in spite of herself

SHARON
Okay -- one thing I dont believe
is that supposed to business
We were supposed to meet That
sounds a little fringy to me like
something you might hear on public
access TV You believe that

CATCH
Some people say we each give off a
particular odor -- that can only
be detected by one other persons
brain

SHARON
So we smell each other Who
says that

-- the

CATCH

I have no idea

(as they smile)
Im more in the destiny school
we-met-in-another-life school Do
you believe that Do you think
when we die -- we come back in
another form

SHARON
You mean like a duck No I
think dead is dead Ive been

thinking about it all day -- and I
dont want to think about it
anymore

He looks at her steps close to her takes the drink out
of her hand puts it to his lips and drinks it all down
He puts the glass on the table

SHARON
Whyd you do that

CATCH
See Now youre thinking about
me

She gets a half smile assessing him Her look is
direct and the attraction is there He feels it too
and he deflects it nodding toward a large photomural of
snowcapped mountains

CATCH
Let me guess Colorado

SHARON
Its Austria but I cant picture
myself in Austria Im not good
with languages so I couldnt
qualify for the departments over
there

She rises and goes to a desk and takes the holstered gun
off her ankle She takes the cuffs off her belt the
mace from her jacket the shield from her shirt pocket
puts them all in a desk drawer She takes off her jacket
and throws it over a chair Disarmed she turns to him
Her look is all wanting and pushing away almost fierce
in her struggle He sees this
SHARON
Thanks for coming up here

CATCH
Does that mean Im going

SHARON
(flustered)
No You dont have to I

CATCH
You okay now

Her eyes grow a bit hard defensive
SHARON
Oh Youre here as a medic
CATCH

Is this the mad part

She smiles in spite of herself -- again He has gotten

to her She wants to fall into this guy but shes
pumping those brakes They are standing close together

SHARON
Maybe going is a good idea

CATCH
Can I come back some time

SHARON
Why

CATCH
(shrugs)
Must be the smell

That makes her laugh and her resistance falls away with
her surprised laughter and she puts her hands around the
back of his neck Her touch is electric to him She is
going in for a kiss and he is retreating They stare a
moment -- and then he suddenly takes her shoulders and
lets loose his own longing It is a hungry and
passionate kiss and in the very midst of it he breaks
off and pulls back his darkness rushing at him She is
staring surprised and he is looking a bit shaken
getting the words out just above a whisper

CATCH
I better go

She doesnt know what to say The moment hangs He
leaves Once he closes the door the breath escapes her
and she shakes her head -- feeling like an idiot She
lost control With a stranger

SHARON
Oh God

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Catch leaving Sharons building in a turmoil of emotions
staring hard at his thoughts -- and he steps into the
path of a car The CAR SCREECHES to a stop and the

scream of those brakes and white light of the head lamps
paralyze Catch and he sees --

FLASHBACK - SLIVER OF IMAGE

Headlights suddenly washing into a vehicle he is driving

BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)
This sliver of memory jolts HIM -- and then another one
comes

FLASHBACK - HEADLIGHTS

coming closer and the scream of brakes from his memory
and all of this is exploded --

BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)

by the angry DRIVER shouting at him

DRIVER
What the hell do you think youre
doing
Catch is numb -- completely shut down there in the middle

of the street The Driver exits his car and comes toward
him raging

DRIVER
Are you crazy

Catch isnt even aware of him The man gawks at this --
and now Catch walks off It is raining The streets are
wet

ANGLE - RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

As Catch continues his walk he is still a bit shaken --
but when he passes a parked car with the window half
open rain getting in he hesitates He cant just walk
on He looks about He tests the lock He opens the
door rolls up the window closes the door walks on

But a MAN is just exiting a doorway to the street -- and
calls out

MAN
Hey Hey What did you do
Catch stops and turns in the rain The Man hurries
toward him upset angry

MAN
Thats my car What the hell were
you doing
CATCH
Nothing I just
The Man shoves him
MAN
I saw you What did you take out
of there
CATCH
No I rolled up the window Its

rain
The Man gets in his face shaky

MAN
You take my phone Hah

He shoves Catch again and Catchs desperate confusion
explodes in a surprising reaction grabbing the Mans
jacket front in one hand and not punching him but quickly
slap slap slapping him saying

CATCH
Hey Hey Wake up Wake up
The Man is now speechless frozen terrified as Catchs
eyes hold him with a fierceness -- and a sadness

CATCH
I helped you
(pause)
I helped you

Catch lets him go and immediately begins walking away
hunching into the rain his expression dark and troubled
He gets five steps away and turns The Man steps back --
but Catch only says

CATCH
Im sorry

And he walks on The Man watches him go

INT CATCHS APARTMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR - NEXT DAY

a newly-bought wicker chair in the elevator with a small
table across his lap other boxes nearby and a
long-stemmed rose in his hand wrapped for giving

He rises and hurriedly gets his purchases off the
elevator so the woman and little boy can enter

He smiles at her a bit less subdued than before as he
gets his things into the hall -- and he manages a special
look for Tommy a wink He frees the elevator they step
inside As the door starts to close Catchs face

We hear Tommy laugh as the door closes Catch carries

his new possessions to his apartment

She hears VOICES inside LARRY AND KATHY a quick
murmuring low-voice argument cant make out the words
In a moment Larry opens the door

LARRY

As Sharon walks into this toy-strewn room Larry Jr is
sitting on the floor watching a small TV Kathy is not

SHARON
Hey Champ
But he stays focused on the TV some darkness some
unsayable worry in his eyes She picks up a toy car
speaks softly

SHARON
Yknow they call this one a woody

hurting for him Larry is now in the doorway Sharon
kisses the childs head and walks out passing her

He swings a slap at her She blocks it and punches him
hard in the face and he crashes down on the floor
Kathy comes running calling out

KATHY
Dont hurt her Lar

Kathy sees that its Larry on his ass The little boy
comes out of his room There is a surprised moment
Then Kathy picks up the child and takes him back to his
room Larry is sitting up shaken his nose bleeding
Sharon goes close to him rigid with fury

SHARON
I know how it feels cause I
remember I remember standing
between you and Dad and taking the
blows for you -- and for what
You turned out to be just like

(pause)
And so did I

And she leaves the house and SLAMS the DOOR

INT SHARONS APARTMENT - NIGHT

She is just returning home after her shift very tired
drained She absently turns ON the TV the STEREO She
notices a blinking light on her MESSAGE MACHINE and hits
the button

LARRY (VO)
I bet you feel real proud of
yourself Shar knocking me down
in front of my family You know
what Ive got in my hand Ive
got a Polaroid picture of my
busted-up face and Im thinking
of sending it to your department
to your lieutenant Im going to
turn you in to the police Shar
and see how you like it

The message ends She stands there a moment

SHARON
(quietly)
Oh God Oh shit

She sits on the edge of a chair worried deep in her
thoughts hitting bottom -- the darkness engulfing her
In a moment she looks at her desk walks there opens a
drawer pulls out that piece of tape with Catchs number
on it -- but it is all stuck to itself She hesitates
then starts to pick it apart when a KNOCK at the door
makes her jump She wonders then somehow she knows
She walks to the door

SHARON
Its you right

She unlocks and opens the door stares at Catch very
vulnerable on the very edge her pain and fear over
Larry just under the surface Catch holds a box of
cookies as an offering

SHARON
Can you just shut up Just shut
up and listen

CATCH
I didnt say anything

SHARON
I dont want to talk I dont
care if you have to play some game
and pretend youre a ‘angel of
mercy or whatever I dont
care but I dont want to hear
about it All right I dont
want to hear anything

She steps back allowing him in and closes the door and
turns to him

SHARON
Its a bad night

He sees her pain and puts his arms around her pushes
through his fear and holds her -- and she lays her head
on his chest He embraces her fully and the effect on
him goes deep to his core where there is both pain and
longing but he holds on to her even rocks her a bit
She sighs In a moment

SHARON
This is good but Im too tired
to stand up anymore

He walks her to the couch and has her sit and then
slowly gently he disarms her He lifts her leg
takes the ankle holster and gun off puts it on the
table He turns her takes the cuffs off her belt from
the middle of her back He reaches into her pants pocket
and removes the Mace From her shirt pocket he takes her
ID shield He has her lie down on the couch now their
faces close eyes locked They linger

SHARON
You want to kiss me

He looks a little lost but he nods helpless He comes
toward her lips -- finally -- but just before they touch
she says softly
SHARON

Kiss me someplace Ive never been
kissed
Hes not sure what to do He begins to look her over --
as if hunting and she gets a soft smile He starts
slowly toward her ear -- but she shakes her head Her
shirt is out of her belt and her midriff bare and he
starts to move there but checks her with a look She
shakes her head He hunts Her smile deepens a bit He
takes her hand and turns it over going for the soft
flesh on the underside of her forearm and she closes her
eyes He kisses her there softly and then again and
then he lavishes kisses from her wrist to the underside
of her elbow as she sighs with pleasure and draws up her
knees in a kind of sensual glow that is leading them
to No He stops She looks at him a deep look soft
voice

SHARON
Why do you stop You always stop

She has a glimpse of his mystery the old sorrow the
deep pain He hugs her drawn-up knees closing his eyes
a moment Then he sits on the couch puts a pillow on
his lap and raises her slightly lays her head on the
pillow He strokes her hair her scalp as she closes her
eyes and sighs slowly moving toward sleep Our TRUMPET
MUSIC slides in here lush and dreamy as we linger a
while and then --

SLOW DISSOLVE TO

INT SHARONS APARTMENT - MORNING

Just after dawn Catch has slept on the couch He is
beginning to awaken now as the first light strikes the
windows The dreamy TRUMPET FADES OUT Catchs eyes
clear sleep replaced by thought and he is suddenly
shaken by --

FLASHBACK - CATCHS POV

-- a sliver of memory But in this one he is driving
We see his hands on the wheel Then his POV looks to the
side and we see an Asian-American woman seated beside
him attractive about his age Her name is Annie She
is saying something to him We dont hear the words
When the FLASHBACK ENDS --

BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)

Catch sits up on the couch jolted He gets another
sudden --
FLASHBACK - HEADLIGHTS

glaring through his windshield blinding him He gasps
sitting there on the couch but its all over He
stands rattled and he moves toward Sharons bedroom

INT BEDROOM - MORNING

Sharon is peacefully asleep He stands over her with
troubled eyes but this slowly changes to a loving look
He bends close to her face He feels her breath on him
He wants to lie down with her -- but he raises a hand and
very gently brushes her cheek She stirs He does it
again She sighs a peaceful sigh opens her eyes He
smiles at her

CATCH
New day

EXT BOULEVARD - DAY

Sharon is driving Catch home They are now on a main

boulevard of stores office buildings They stop at a
light Both are surprised by a voice calling out from
the pedestrians crossing the street

PINDELLA (0S)
Catch

They look up to see a well-dressed man pausing in the
middle of the crosswalk to face their car He is in his
forties tall with grey-blond hair This is RICHARD
PINDELLA He has a small smile and wave for Catch
Sharon is curious looking at Catch Catch throws the
man a dark look and then turns away ignoring him
nervous intense

PINDELLA
Catch

CATCH
(to Sharon)

Drive will you

Pindella is moving toward the car Sharon watching him
wondering

CATCH
Drive

The light changes Pindella hurries to the curb as the
cars surge forward Sharon drives slowly checking the
mirror to see Pindella stare after them -- then enter the
office building on the corner

CATCH
Will you get off this street

She makes a turn glancing at Catch

SHARON
What You owe him money

But his dark look persists and he doesnt answer
Then

CATCH
If you take a right and stop -- we
can walk from here Id rather

He is nervous being in the car -- and glad to leave it

when she pulls over She watches this wondering

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
Sharon exits the car and locks it staring at Catch

SHARON
If youre in trouble

CATCH
Im not

SHARON
If youre in trouble with him
maybe I can help

CATCH
Forget about him Somebody I used
to know I dont want to know him
anymore Thats all Forget
about it Walk with me

She hesitates then falls in beside him as he walks on
They walk along in silence the neighborhood growing more
seedy tougher as they go Catch is relaxing now trying
to push it all away Sharon looks around her

SHARON
This is not a great place to walk

CATCH
I like it here Its fine

SHARON

CATCH
Whats the problem

SHARON
Besides the shootings break-ins

As someone approaches them Catch makes eye contact and
smiles a small friendly smile-in-passing He gets a
brief smile in return He and Sharon amble on He does
it again

SHARON
You know everybody here

He nods to another YOUNG MAN hes never met

CATCH
Hows it goin

SHARON

CATCH

She has misgivings A young woman is bustling along
Sharon makes eye contact and presents a nervous smile and
a nod -- but the woman looks at her sternly and bustles
on

SHARON
I feel like a jerk I feel like a
smiley face

Catch smiles Sharon frowns but when an OLD MAN passes
she gives a small smile The Man lights up

OLD MAN
Mornin

Catch looks at her She tries to shrug it off but cant
quite hide her pleasure Now Catch is pausing as a woman
is walking her six-year-old daughter to their parked car

Catch makes eye contact with the girl and does a goofy
wave that makes her smile Sharon smiles too As the
girls MOTHER is unlocking the car the girl shyly looks
back at Catch for more fun He does that quick finger
trick -- trying to catch his own thumb and the girl
giggles But the Mother is impatient

MOM
Go on

The girl gets in The Mother is about to close the door
She frowns mean-eyed

MOM
Move your arm
The girl slides in further and the Mother slams the
door The girl follows her mother with hurt eyes as she
walks around to the drivers side Catch has paused to
watch this his eyes gentle on the girl The Mother is
about to enter the car when she sees Catch staring
MOM

CATCH
She feels bad cause you yelled at

MOM

at the womans anger

through it walking quickly He is passing an alley
when he hears a CRASH He looks in

EXT ALLEY - DAY

He sees a large dog that has just knocked over a garbage

slowly find their way to a sad smile

EXT CITY STREETS - DAY

now so loaded with toys it wont shut Some brightly-
painted soldiers are sticking out of the drawer

In the living room there are two chairs now and more
lamps and tables Our PAN REVEALS that the dog from the
alley is sitting in the living room watching Catch --
whom we now see is hanging a picture on the wall -- a
mountain scene He holds the picture in one place then
moves it to another wondering His fight with Sharon
still colors his mood but hes working through it

CATCH
Do we go for symmetry Or

He glances at the dog as he moves the picture

blow

They stare She starts walking back into his darkening
front yard looking over her shoulder She walks to a
tree where the tire swing hangs waits there He goes
back inside but leaves the door open In a moment he
reappears coming outside closing the door behind him

ON SHARON AND LARRY

As they meet by the tire swing His eyes burn her hate
and pain

SHARON

her chest and walks away The photo falls to the ground

Larry says without turning

LARRY

and she snaps

SHARON

The words burst out of her thick with tears but shes
not crying Larry stops and turns

her Catch is falling behind breathing heavily

EXT POND - DAY (BIT LATER)

Sharon is already unpacking their lunch as Catch trudges
up and collapses near a stream-fed pond She hands him a

sandwich but he shakes his head

CATCH
No thanks I cant eat and have a
heart attack at the same time

She smiles again and takes a bite and stares off
soon enough her dark thoughts come and cover her
Catch notices

CATCH
As soon as you get happy you get
sad
SHARON
Im okay Everythings code four
CATCH

Everythings what

SHARON
Everythings fine

CATCH
Fine This isnt fine I know

CATCH

He keeps staring waiting She is chewing a sandwich
looking at him Finally she begins -- with no emotion

SHARON
Yesterday Okay Yesterday we
rolled on a 415 Juliette and
Sanchez had these four guys
against a wall but they were
HDB and definitely unco-op It
got pretty jumpy but we got them
in the car with a couple of
bruises and Robby got a sprained
wrist so I did the rest of the
shift with a rookie who lost it
over a DB in Sunset Park old
woman whod been dead maybe six
seven days and I usually do all
right but the smell got to me and
I can still smell her Then we
arrested a prostitute working out
of her home and I carried her
little girl out to the social
worker and the kid was holding on
real tight and making my shoulder
wet and I wanted to punch her
rock-head mother and then shift
ended and I had a nice visit with
my brother Larry

He is staring at her He takes her hands holds them
CATCH
(softly)
Im sorry That would make
anybody sad

SHARON
Sorry you asked

CATCH
No No you can always tell me

She stares a moment then speaks with an irony he doesnt
pick up on

SHARON
Well I feel better now You
feel better

CATCH
I feel fine Great

He takes off his T-shirt and begins stripping off his
shorts his underwear
SHARON
What are you doing

She is surprised smiling as he plunges into the pond
her darkness dissipating

SHARON
Catch Theres no swimming here
And you cant be naked in a state
park

He dives under and surfaces again

CATCH
Take the day off Pogo

SHARON
What if a park ranger comes

He dives and surfaces once more We STAY CLOSE ON him

CATCH
Take your badge off for once
Dont be such a damn Marine about
everything Just

He stops because she isnt there He looks about Then
suddenly he sees her poised on a boulder right above
him in her underwear about to dive He yelps and gets
out of her way and she dives off the rock in classic
near-professional form a beautiful sleek dive She
hits the water just right and surfaces and they splash
and swim and frolic and dunk each other in unabashed
play

At one point she jumps at him to dunk him and he catches
her They are in chest-deep water and their faces are
close They pause -- then she goes in for a kiss but he
pulls his head back avoiding that kiss and says

CATCH
Someplace Ive never been kissed

She smiles staring then slowly reaches her hands to his
face gently closes his eyes and is about to kiss him on
the closed lids but she changes her mind and instead
puts her lips tenderly on each of the small scars on his
face Then she moves away He opens his eyes She

walks to the shore moves to her clothes and starts
getting dried and dressed giving him a soft look

Catch comes to the shore to dry himself but as he
dresses Sharon glances at his body -- and the scarring
on his chest and arms He is troubled about this
avoiding her eyes Then he makes a decision

CATCH

They tell me I was in an accident
Long time ago

SHARON
Looks like a bad one

CATCH
I dont remember it I
She waits -- but he says no more She continues

dress sliding her shorts over her wet underwear
before she puts her shirt on she turns her back
off her wet bra He glances at her She looks
catches him glancing They both smile softly
ironically as they finish dressing

SHARON
We should be thinking about lunch
We have to pack up

Cant you rub without talking

(then)
Its been bad with my family a
long time so the hell with it
anyway If they dont want me
there I dont want to be there
All right

CATCH
All right
(then as he works)
Bad how

SHARON
Oh Jesus

But we see her eyes turn inward toward the old pain and
for once she shares it

SHARON

My father used to knock us around
all of us But Im the one who

called the cops -- finally
(pause)

They say I turned against the

family

Catch works in silence a while absorbing this looking
at Sharon with more tenderness than ever In a moment

CATCH
But they invited you

SHARON
You dont know anything about it
So forget it

CATCH
Well I know about family

SHARON
Oh yeah What about it

CATCH
Its a door you dont close

SHARON
I didnt close the door

CATCH
Youre closing it now Right
Family invites you you go
Family shows up you welcome them
in Thats family

SHARON
Oh sure What if they dont

deserve it

CATCH
Then you forgive

SHARON
You have all the answers

CATCH
No I just It seems like a
chance doesnt it A chance to
make things right Id take it
Then you tried -- yknow And
its up to them

Sharon is considering his words but shes also deep in
her old pain defensive challenging

SHARON
You close with your family

That hits him but he keeps rubbing her gentle now
looking a little lost He doesnt answer

SHARON
See So why should I listen to
you

But as he works her back in silence we see her facing
her pain and thinking through it

INT SHARONS APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING

Just after dawn Catch is on the couch stirring in his
sleep in the grip of an unsettling dream We hear what
he hears the VOICES of his wife his son murmurings
Were not sure of the words even laughter Catchs eyes
snap open jolted out of sleep but the VOICES dont
stop and he suddenly sits up The VOICES FADE as he
catches his breath gulping air He tries to calm down
In a moment he rises and moves to Sharons bedroom

INT BEDROOM - MORNING

He comes to the side of the bed and sees that she is
asleep He sits on the bed and studies her his dark
thoughts dissipating as he watches her sleep his eyes
going deep In a moment he begins to raise a hand to
brush her cheek -- the way awakened her before -- but he
stops before touching her Instead he brings his face
close to her and lightly kisses her
She stirs He kisses her again She opens her eyes
They stare at each other She raises a limp hand and
touches his face He begins to come close slowly for
another kiss She welcomes it They kiss on the mouth
very tenderly They kiss again -- deeper They kiss
again and she holds him and he moves fully onto the
bed lying over her and supporting his weight on his
elbows and kissing and kissing and letting go for once
hungry for her because she is in his heart now and she
is a salvation and there is a moment when they both
pause and stare clear-eyed acknowledging what they are
doing and both of them abandon their fear and pain and
begin to smile and they make love that way smiling as
we slowly

DISSOLVE TO

INT BLUES CLUB - NIGHT

The night of that same day finds us at this neighborhoody
place with a lot of down-to-earth atmosphere and not a
lot of noise like Harvells in Santa Monica -- earthy
blues and jazz from a small band in a darkish club small
dance floor We PAN during this slow number and ARRIVE

AT a few dancing couples including Sharon and Catch who
mostly just hold each other and sway When their eyes
meet there is a lot of deep pleasure there

The music ends The small crowd applauds Couples head
back to the tables but the little band goes right into a
more up-tempo but still earthy blues Sharon stops and
pulls Catch back onto the dance floor He smiles and
follows

This number has a driving beat and slowly we watch
Sharon drop her inhibitions and become more and more free
out there and Catch is smiling and wowed by her and she
laughs wowing herself and she keeps going getting wild
and playful and its something to see We LINGER ON the
joy and abandon Shes earned it They go a little

crazy happy crazy and in a while we

DISSOLVE TO

SAME - HOURS LATER

The blues club is emptying out Its late The band is
finishing what seems to be its last number for the last
of thinning crowd -- including a tired happy Sharon and
Catch who applaud the end of the number Catch stares at
her
CATCH
Whats your favorite song

He rises -- as if to go to the band with a request She
smiles spent

SHARON
Catch Im beat So are they I
think theyre finished

CATCH
One more Its a surprise
She watches as he leaves her walks to the bandstand He

talks to the leader who is the PIANO PLAYER

SHARONS POV

From the instrument cases on the floor behind the piano
Catch picks up a trumpet case opens it Now Sharons
tired smile is changing to curiosity wonder

ON CATCH

As he puts the mouthpiece on the horn nervous but
excited too speaking to the Piano Player

CATCH
Thanks Danny

DANNY (PIANO PLAYER)
Gonna be good having you back
Catch

Catch comes to the edge of the bandstand grinning a bit
at Sharon at his surprise for her nervously fingering
the horn He puts it to his lips

ON SHARON

Mouth-open surprise -- and then smiling with the wonder -
- and Catch begins to play closing his eyes and
rendering a ballad like the haunting ANGEL EYES

Sharons smile slowly fades replaced by a much deeper
look not only because he is so good but because he is
showing her his heart his love and even his pain -- more
than he can show her any other way We INTERCUT as he
opens his eyes briefly watching her sending her the
music closing his eyes again to fall into the song -- as
Sharons eyes fill at the beauty and sadness of it and
at this look inside her man We LINGER Then
DISSOLVE TO

EXT CLUB - NIGHT

We keep the sound of CATCHS TRUMPET going as he and
Sharon exit the club and begin to stroll away arms
around each other In a moment he stops He cant go
another step He has to kiss her He holds her face and
comes in for the kiss and above the music we hear her
say softly

SHARON
Where Ive never been kissed

He stops and stares a moment then takes her hand and
walks her out into the middle of the traffic-less
boulevard and there in the center of the street kisses
her and she responds and it is their finest fullest
moment lifting on the MUSIC and it is ironic and
prophetic that at its peak they are washed over by the
revolving light from a police car and a SIREN that CHIRPS
once as they break staring

SHARON
Oh God

We WIDEN to see Ray and Sanchez in their police unit 20
feet away Ray uses a small electronic bullhorn to
say

RAY
Are you in danger there

SHARON
Go away

RAY
I was talking to him Pogo

CATCH
No thanks Ray Everythings code
four Go away

Sharon laughs aloud and walks (with Catch in hand) to the
police car her joy overwhelming any embarrassment She

gestures behind them at the jazz club

SHARON
See that place Hes going to be
playing there every weekend

Catch notes the pride with which she says this
RAY
(impressed to Catch)
Oh yeah What dyou play
SHARON
Its music Ray You wouldnt

like it

She waves and walks off with Catch arms around each
other The cops watch them go

INT CATCHS BEDROOM - DAY (NEXT MORNING)

Sharon is asleep alone in the tousled bed

INT LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Catch is dressed putting a leash on Bob glancing into
the bedroom at Sharon

There is love in his look and then a passing question
too a residue of fear now that their relationship has

begun in full -- but it all ends up in a soft smile for
her as he walks Bob to the door He hesitates at the
door -- then walks into the kitchen and slides open that

drawer of toys stares at them

INT BEDROOM - MORNING (MINUTES LATER)

Sharon is waking sleepy She rises finds a robe and
slips it on calling out softly for Catch

INT LIVING ROOM - MORNING

She smiles and moves into the bedroom to dress

EXT CITY PARK - DAY (MINUTES LATER)

Catch is walking Bob in the park but is also checking
for someone studying the playground He begins walking
toward the swings

metal truck Catch walks up to Tommy carrying a bulging
plastic bag -- but Tommys attention is on Bob and pets
the big friendly dog

ANGLE - CANDACE

She sits on a bench nearby watching this smiling a bit

ON CATCH TOMMY

Catch kneels in the sand beside the boy and he spills
out the contents of the bag -- action figures
superheroes soldiers Tommy goes wide-eyed at the
array Catch is pleased by the boys reaction Catch
keeps a layer of emotion covered here

CATCH
You like these

TOMMY
Yeah
CATCH
Well Theyre for you We can

pretend its your birthday

Tommy stares at him then back at the toys in delight
Candace is walking toward them and Catch turns to her

CATCH
I hope you dont mind
TOMMY

Her look of surprise questions him

CATCH
Yeah Ive kind of been saving
them up

CANDACE

For Tommy

He nods She kneels close to her boy the toys pleased
but not quite knowing what to say

CANDACE
Well thank you Thanks a lot

Catch nods grins at Tommy who is already at play with
the figures
ANGLE - SHARON
She has entered the park and witnessed this from a
distance She is angling toward the playground
ON CATCH
He watches Tommy at play with the figures but its
almost too much for him He touches the boy and rises
smiles and nods at Candace and begins to walk off

ON SHARON

She hurries her steps to intersect with Catch

ON CANDACE TOMMY

CANDACE
Wow Tommy -- Look at them all
Did you say thank you

Now Tommy looks up Catch is moving away with Bob
walking home Tommy stands up Candace calls out to stop
Catch

CANDACE

Excuse me

ON CATCH
But he is walking on some of the emotion seeping
through not darkness some old joy welling up We see

in bg Tommy starts to run after him

to say thanks We

now have a convergence of Tommy Sharon and Catch who is
moving steadily toward the street crossing a bike path
now A BIKER is coming on All in one moment Catch

hears the WHIZZ of the BIKE Tommy calling out Thank

you and Candace shouting Be careful

And Catch goes

cold inside and turns quickly and rushes onto the bike

path taking the collision with the bi

e so Tommy is sure

to be safe Catch and the biker fall hard Sharon stops
-- holding her breath Tommy watches wide-eyed and

Candace comes running

Catch is rising a little sore and soiled The biker is
angry
BIKER
Goddammit -- I saw the kid

Jesus I wasnt even close

But Catch is walking away with that frozen numb look
all shut down by his fear and his memory as Bob trots
along beside him and the Biker comes after him and Tommy
and Candace watch him go and Sharon hurries her steps to
catch up The Biker reaches Catch first
BIKER

Wait a minute Hey

But Catch wont turn to him walking on -- and the man

gets in front of him raging

BIKER

Why the hell did you cause a
wreck I told you -- I saw the

kid you idiot I was

Pain and darkness build in Catchs eyes until he says in
a quiet choked voice right into the Bikers face

CATCH

One more word and your life will

change forever

The man stops talking looking at the dead certainty in

Catchs eyes He wants to say more to

save face but

Catchs look holds him like a fist Sharon has stopped

frozen watching The Biker turns away

and walks back to
his downed bike as Catch moves on Sharon can hardly
believe all of this following Catch again

ON CATCH SHARON

SHARON
Catch Catch

It takes a moment for her voice to penetrate then he
quickly turns and sees her approaching

SHARON
Are you all right Your elbows
bleeding I
But he is tight nearly frozen everything held in

SHARON
Whats wrong

He walks away from her and this shakes her and she
catches up again

SHARON
Where are you going Catch --
youre scaring me Please

But he walks on desperate and she gets in his way
faces him

SHARON
Please Catch dont Cant you
talk to me
He turns and walks off heading for the street

SHARON
Please Wait I Catch

He has walked into traffic -- not completely unmindful of
the cars but desperate to get away She watches this
frozen as HORNS BLARE He has to stop in the middle of
the street to wait a moment and he stands there
stricken

ON CATCH

As the traffic moves around him and the dog -- a HORN
BLARES BRAKES SCREECH and he thrown into a storm of

FLASHBACKS

That come sharper and faster than before bits and pieces
of memory outside any order He is driving Annie smiles
at him headlights blind him Annie screams the little
boy in Annies arms grins at him BRAKES SCREAM Annie
says something to him calmly but he cant hear her the
headlights blind him again and BRAKES SCREAM again and

the traffic let up and Catch crosses and walks toward
home She watches him go

Sharon is in the report room using the computer
hunting We MOVE AROUND to see her and the screen She
is searching the police records to find the accident

suddenly stops as we FOCUS ON the name LAMBERT Then
we watch her as she punches up the data and she reads

DISSOLVE TO

INT SHARONS APARTMENT - NIGHT

We MOVE THROUGH Sharons nearly dark apartment its
stillness in strange contrast to the manic TRUMPET RIFFS
We PAN to find her curled in a chair staring deeply
sadly drinking a drink As we PAN we DISCOVER she is
looking at that mural of the mountains and through this
to her thoughts and then she makes a decision and rises
and goes to the phone punches in a number

INT CATCHS BEDROOM - NIGHT

He is sitting on his bed back against the headboard
sitting there fully dressed shoes and all knees up --
as he plays his muted trumpet hard and fast playing the
incredible riffs weve been hearing playing in a driven
way keeping his demons away When the RING of the PHONE
breaks through he stops suddenly He waits His
MACHINE CLICKS ON and BEEPS We INTERCUT the call as
Sharons voice comes on subdued

SHARON
Catch its me Can you pick up

But he sits there waiting listening

SHARON

Catch waits on a busy street corner in Westwood Village
not far from Santa Monica He is waiting glancing over
the passing crowds for Sharon He sees her She is off
duty out of uniform He watches her until she spots
him She smiles a little but there is a mix of fear and
sadness in her smile They walk to each other and stop
and hug but it is brief and then she keeps walking
slowly and he walks beside her There is a strain
lingering between them

CATCH
Shar Im sorry about yesterday

SHARON
Thats okay
CATCH

Its hard to explain but its
Im okay now

SHARON
You dont have to explain

He glances at her wondering walking along
CATCH
So whyd we meet here

SHARON
So youre the trumpet player who
was waking people up -- on my
beat

They walk along in silence a moment

CATCH
I used to practice late
outside On my roof

SHARON

They smile nervous smiles She walks on leading him

agitation but covering it

CATCH

answer)
Thats okay I mean Ill go

death The mall on a Saturday

Just about any
He slows his steps looking across the street and down
half a block
HIS POV
We see an ivy-covered brick building there with a sign
that is too far away for us to read

ON CATCH AND SHARON

He looks quickly away from that building She sees his
growing agitation

SHARON
You can trust me you know

She takes his hand

SHARON
Ive got you now Im holding on
-- like before

CATCH
What dyou mean

SHARON
Like I held you before Like I
did -- at the accident

He suddenly pulls his hand out of hers shocked and it
shakes her

SHARON
What makes it so unspeakable
Catch What makes it like that

He begins to shut down to grow cold and numb and not
hear this

SHARON
Is it because you were driving

He turns away closing his eyes

SHARON
I read the reports and it wasnt
your fault It wasnt Is it
because you survived and they
didnt

She puts her hand out for him again

SHARON
Catch Please Hold on and
well go in there together

He does not take her hand so she takes his and walks a
few steps toward that building

SHARON
You can talk to them You can say
goodbye or I love you or
whatever

He pulls his hand away again more violently a layer of
rage over his pain

CATCH
This is wrong Its wrong Why
are you doing this

SHARON
To help you

CATCH
I dont need your help I dont
need this We dont need this --

SHARON
Were not Were not fine Catch
Nothing is fine -- no matter how

much you pretend

It is as if shes fighting for his life again -- and her
own

SHARON

You pretend that nothing happened
You walk all over the city helping
people but youre dying inside

CATCH
Im not dying Im not
pretending I dont remember I
dont remember any of it So

He has stung her The tears are in her throat She has
to take a moment but she pushes through to say

quietly

SHARON

CATCH

SHARON

When youre ready Ill be there

And she turns and walks away He watches her go angry
scared and sorry for what he said He takes a few steps
after her wanting to call out and to stop her We see
him almost call to her He is coming apart watching
her needing her so much but unable to call out

He is shaky He takes a glance at that building then
away He stares after Sharon -- but shes out of sight
now He steels himself then looks across the street
again at that building

He is desperately afraid He stares at the building a
long while He begins to cross the street He makes
fists to keep from shaking He walks to the entrance

EXT BUILDING - DAY

This is the Wellston Memorial Chapel and Mausoleum
The sign is on one of the brick pillars The iron gate

SHARON
How come its not working for you
There is a scattering of laughter -- almost by rote -- as
Sharon enters her car without even the hint of a smile
Robby notices She just punches up the CAD monitor all
business Our TRUMPET MUSIC comes in aching now and
takes us into

INT SHARONS APARTMENT - NIGHT

She is exercising on the machine sliding into her
crunches fast and furious but all the pain and sorrow
is in her eyes and in a moment she just stops The
TRUMPET MUSIC KEEPS GOING ON through this She looks
over at the phone

INT CATCHS APARTMENT - NIGHT

We PAN OVER Bob-the-Dog watching something We see a

few scattered sheets of music lying about hearing
RUSTLING and we ARRIVE AT Catch seated on the floor
shuffling through a stack of sheet music driven looking
for something The PHONE RINGS He ignores it He is
opening up each chart of music shaking it out
searching

Sharons voice comes on his machine almost hollow with
sorrow

SHARON (VO)
Catch Can you pick up
(pause)
Will you call me

He keeps searching seeming to not even listen The
MACHINE CLICKS OFF He shakes the next music chart and
something falls out He stares at this piece of paper
picks it up slowly turns it over It is a picture of
himself a man blowing a horn drawn in crayon by a four
or five-year-old Catch stares at this with a depth that

goes on forever as the MUSIC ENDS

EXT STREET - NEXT DAY
Sharon and Robby are rolling to a stop in a strip mall
parking lot exiting their car No rush Shes still
very downbeat As they walk from the car he keeps

glancing at her concerned for her

ROBBY
Pogo

She puts up a hand to brush all the words away She
cant talk about it She pushes through it by doing the
work

SHARON
Which store is it

ROBBY
The little market there They
came through a back window last
night Mostly vandalism

They walk on but as Sharon reaches the sidewalk a
little child three years old or so toddles out the door
of a shop A SKATEBOARDER is rattling along and Sharon
makes a grab for the child taking his arm gently

SHARON
Whoa

» and pulling him to safety as the Skateboarder passes
by shouting

SKATER
Sorry

And now the WORRIED MOTHER is emerging from the shop

WORRIED MOTHER
Oh God thank you Billy

She picks up her boy walks back into the shop Sharon
stands there -- as it all blooms inside of her rocks
her really this little act evoking Catch who he is
what he said and what he means to her Robby is a few
steps ahead waiting for her but she cant move yet
looking around her now at the people walking among the
shops and cafes She picks one She catches the eyes
She gives a brief smile The smile is answered shyly
kindly the person moves on

ROBBY
Pogo
She doesnt move for a moment Then she turns to Robby

SHARON
Theres something I have to do I

need an address and phone

ROBBY

SHARON

Robby looks at her then nods giving her this

They walk back to the car

EXT UPSCALE RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

We see Sharon walking quickly from her police car to the
front of Mrs Chus home Robby waits in the unit

EXT CHU HOME - DAY

Sharon walks under that covered portico to the front
door but before she rings the bell a voice startles her
a bit

ELANORA (0S)
Pogo

Mrs Chu emerges from the shadows of the portico rolling
her wheelchair toward Sharon She has a smile for her --
but with some reserve

SHARON
Im Sharon Pogue I know all
about the
ELANORA
Elanora
Sharon nods very held back She gestures toward the

wheelchair self-consciously
SHARON
Im sorry for what happened I
know about the accident
ELANORA
(hopeful)
He told you

SHARON
No I found out and I
remembered I was there

ELANORA
Oh Yes

Sharon stares a moment begins with some of her tough
cover in place over her emotions

SHARON
I guess he comes here a lot -- to
talk to you

ELANORA

He shops for me Twice a week

SHARON
Oh And when he comes here -- he
never mentions the past never
talks about the accident

ELANORA
No
SHARON
And you let him do that All
this time Why
ELANORA

Its what he needs

SHARON
Walking all over the city like

ELANORA
Like an angel Yes Sweet man
SHARON
But you let him get so lost

Elanora is a bit defensive now

ELANORA
I let him find his own way through
it Why did you come here

Sharon

SHARON
Because I want to know how to
help him

ELANORA

You are helping him

SHARON
I dont think so

ELANORA
Why not
SHARON
He he was paying me back I

guess for the accident for
helping him Thats why he
felt so close to me But

ELANORA
Is that what you think

SHARON
But now he probably hates me
I
ELANORA

What happened

SHARON
I took him to the cemetery and

ELANORA
The cemetery

Elanoras look darkens and she begins to shake her head
in worry

SHARON
I thought it might help him
come back you know But he
wouldnt even go in He screamed
at me

ELANORA
(upset)
What made you take him there

SHARON
For the truth

ELANORA
He knows the truth

SHARON
But he wont even say it or

ELANORA
Thats his way Thats his way
through all this He made a wall
-- around that whole day that
night -- other things too He
keeps them behind the wall -- his
little boy my daughter He cant
help it The cemetery Do you
know how hard it is for me to go
to the cemetery Can you imagine

Sharon is shaken by this realizing crumbling a bit as
Mrs Chu goes on

ELANORA
Thats where it stares you in the
face -- the loss And its too

much sometimes

Elanora takes a breath acknowledging how upset she is

ELANORA
See Im still finding my way
through it And Catch -- it

almost kills him to think about it
or say it or drive a car or see
the place where it happened or
go by the cemetery

SHARON
I was trying to help him come
back to some kind of life I

ELANORA
But he was coming back Do you
realize how much he changed in the
past weeks His apartment his
life his music is coming back
He fell in love He even got a
job Sharon -- for you For the
two of you Isnt that coming
back Why do you have to rush
Everybody has to rush these days

Sharon battered by the truth of this is totally exposed
now realizing admitting

SHARON
I was scared I push so hard
when Im scared
ELANORA
Scared of what

SHARON
Losing him So I did I lost
him He wont talk to me I I

didnt know what I was doing

Elanora sighs looking at her and her anger drains away
studying Sharons misery

ELANORA
You were finding your way What
else can we do You think Im
always sure what to say to him
what not to say I do what I

think is right and hope he sees
the love in it

She shakes her head at Sharons tears her warmth showing
now liking this girl

ELANORA
Look at you -- so worried now so
miserable Thats the love in it

SHARON
Did I make it worse for him

ELANORA
I dont know I really dont
But I think hell see the love in
what you did

Sharon stares without much hope She puts out her hand
to touch Elanoras to say goodbye Elanora takes her
hand and holds on a moment staring into the girl with
strength Sharon nods and walks off dark and sad
Elanora watches her go

INT SHARONS APARTMENT - DAY

Its the next day and Sharon is preparing to go to her
parents renewal of vows She is at the bottom -- with
Catch gone from her life -- but she is doing her best to
go through with this

We START ON a table looking at the invitation and next
to that is a wrapped gift We hear Sharon moving about
see her nervous half-dressed speaking to herself In
the bg we hear our TRUMPET-BASED MUSIC Very soulful

SHARON
I just came by to wish you
well To congratulate you and

wish you well Shit

She checks the mirror again doesnt like the look
starts undressing comes back to the table with the gift
on it wonders if she should add more decoration to the

box She does and as the trumpet plays on we --

CuT TO

SHARON
dressed differently re-wrapping the gift and then --

CuT TO

SHARON
dressed differently rewrapping it again and then --

CuT TO

SHARON

sitting still in a chair holding the gift on her lap
looking at the clock nervous scared sad

EXT STREET - DAY (SAME DAY)

Catch is walking down a commercial street -- no Bob-the-
dog no strolling gait He is focused deep-eyed ona
mission of some kind Our MUSIC CONTINUES over this and
on into

EXT STREET - DAY

The MUSIC CONTINUES over Sharon driving to the church

parking taking a deep breath exiting the car There is
no one else outside the church The ceremony has already
begun Shes planned it that way She enters the church
as the MUSIC FADES OUT

INT CHURCH - DAY

As Sharon comes in quietly The church is not full but
perhaps 50 people sit in the front pews watching the
ceremony at the altar The priest Mr and Mrs Pogue
altar boys Sharon moves forward and slips into a pew a
few back from the altar The slight disturbance of
people sliding over to let her in causes a few people to
glance over

One of them is Kathy They trade a brief nervous nod
Then Kathy whispers to her husband

KATHY
She came

We see Larry grow tense and angry
KATHY

Dont say anything Think of your

parents
Larry doesnt look at Sharon The little boy looking
fine in a tiny suit and tie and being bored leans to
look at his aunt
Sharon and Larry Jr trade a look She winks then
settles back in her pew watches

ON ALTAR

We get our first look at Sharons FATHER Carl Pogue 62
Standing beside his wife a rather big stolid guy taken

with the moment both he and his wife emotional over
this He wears a hearing aid The priest is speaking
ON SHARON

watching with a mix of feelings as the mass continues and
the vows are renewed the priest reciting the rituals

EXT STREET - DAY

The PRIESTS VOICE from the church plays over this scene
invoking the blessings saying the prayers of the mass as
we watch Catch continuing his mission slowing his steps
now and pausing at the entrance to the Welston Memorial
Chapel He hesitates We see the price hes paying and
the determination He walks through the gate

EXT CHAPEL GROUNDS - DAY

He walks into a courtyard of several small buildings ina
garden setting -- all red brick and ivy fountains and
flowers He is fighting his way through this moving
closer to one of the buildings He is nearly alone on

the chapel grounds and as he reaches the sheltered wall
of this building he is alone

This is a wall of bronze vaults within the bricks and on
each vault is a plaque -- a name His breath shivers in
his body as he struggles to lift his eyes Slowly his
gaze comes to rest on a name LAMBERT

As he stares the PRIESTS VOICE from Sharons church
FADES OUT and we are left with silence Catch is
shaky He takes a step closer to the wall to the name

to them -- and he tries to speak but cant He tries
again -- his voice intimate just above a whisper at
first
CATCH

Annie Chet I dont want you

to think I forgot about you Its

just that I I couldnt find

you

(pause)

I woke up and you were gone
Everything was gone It all
just disappeared In one
minute I couldnt remember that
minute I lost it It took me so
long to find it I think I found
it all now I used a calculator
I did I figured it out You
know we get about 1400 minutes
a day and so I figured it out I
was 33 years old and three months
and eight days so it was Ive
got it here

He fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket His hand
is shaking as he reads a number off the paper
CATCH
It was minute number 17 million
eight hundred ten thousand two
hundred or so

He puts the paper away

CATCH
Thats the one I lost And
when I lost that minute I guess I
tried to lose it all all the
memories -- because they hurt I
tried but I couldnt do it

We --

FLASHBACK - INT VAN

to that minute and for once we go in order and
each piece of it We see Catch driving the van
ANNIE beside him His son Chet is in back with
grandparents Elanora and her husband The boy
whiny pouty

We INTERCUT the flashback WITH --

CATCH
at the grave struggling through this
CATCH
Chet you werent feeling so
good remember It was your

birthday and you ate too much

We see Annie and Catch both glance back toward

play out
his wife
his

is a bit

Chet and

we get present sound in this FLASHBACK scene as Catch and
Annie both say Whats the matter Hm Aww And then
Annie looks out the window and turns to Catch and -- we

CUT TO Catch at the grave his eyes filling
CATCH
And Annie you said you

said

In the FLASHBACK we see Annie turn to him again
time we hear her say softly

ANNIE
Slow down in the rain all right

We GO TO Catch at the grave fighting tears

and this
CATCH
And I dont know if I slowed down
I dont know I hope I did
but I didnt always listen Im
sorry Im really sorry

Back in the FLASHBACK we see Annie reach around as
Elanora hands Chet to her Then were BACK at the grave
and INTERCUTTING so that we see Catch speaking through
his tears and we also see this tender moment played out
in the van

CATCH
» You put him on your lap and
he looked at me and I made a
face Remember I made you
smile Chet

(MORE)

CATCH (CONTD)
And then we all smiled and it was
a great minute It was Im
really glad I found that
minute No matter what

Catch stares at the grave in tears as the rest of that
minute now plays out punishing him It lasts only about
three seconds a bus out of control headlights suddenly
glaring through the windshield Catch turning the wheel
BRAKES SCREAMING PEOPLE SCREAMING -- and then its over
And Catch has been battered by the memory and is
weeping but has not looked away He is still staring at
the name of his family and he is able to say ina
broken voice

CATCH
I wont forget anymore I love

you

He steps forward and puts his hand on the plaque rests
it there We STAY ON this then in a moment we

DISSOLVE TO

INT CHURCH - DAY

The renewal of vows is over and Sharon is standing in
the aisle nervous and not sure what to do Guests are
up and milling about many leaving the church See you

PHOTOGRAPHER is setting a group shot at the front of the
church Mr and Mrs Pogue Larry and Kathy and the
little boy

PHOTOGRAPHER

Out of the milling crowd comes Sharon taking a breath
and braving it walking up there speaking quietly

SHARON
Where do you want me

The Photographer turns to her wondering

SHARON

PHOTOGRAPHER
Oh Oh well how about

We see the family shift so that Larry and his family are
on one side of the parents Sharon follows the
Photographers gesture to stand at the other side beside
her Mother Her Father has not looked at her The photo
is taken Sharon now turns to her mom and dad This is
difficult the strain is thick in the air

SHARON
You both look so great

MOTHER
(nervous)

SHARON
I just wanted to

The Father speaks to her his voice not hard but flat
not warm either No smile

FATHER
You coming to the party

SHARON

He nods then turns to greet well-wishers Sharon is
left alone by the drifting away of the family but one
old couple greets her the older woman (Mrs Vander)
wearing her new blue dress her HUSBAND beaming beside
her

MRS VANDER
Sherry Look how nice you look

HUSBAND
Big police officer now

SHARON
Not so big
(to Mrs Vander)

Sharon moves off toward a side exit trying to catch up
with Larry and his family

EXT SIDE OF CHURCH - DAY

As Larry and his family exit -- and Sharon comes out of
the church calling ahead

SHARON
Larry

He starts to just walk on ignoring her but Kathy takes
the little boy and walks ahead with a look at Larry at
Sharon

ON SHARON AND LARRY

They nod to a few passing guests Then theyre alone
His nose is still bandaged but less so anger and
betrayal in his eyes

LARRY
How did you have the guts to walk
into a church after breaking your
word

SHARON
I have to be here Its a chance
to make things right and Im
taking it
LARRY

She stops herself catching her rush toward the old
anger She goes calmer deeper even sad

SHARON
Here Lar

She hands him something It is the Polaroid photo He
looks at it surprised They lock eyes She speaks
softly

SHARON
I was invited Im here Im
going to the party You do what
you want

And she walks off toward the parking lot

INT POGUE HOME - DAY

Were in the midst of the party We see Sharon drifting
a bit a hello here and there She feels out of place

Though the home and yard are thick with people there is
some tension especially in the core group -- all who
know about the estrangement of Sharon Now and then a
nervous glance from her mother is directed at Sharon or
a hostile glance from Larry

Sharon passes the videographer who is pointing light
camera and microphone at the Vanders -- having them put
their good wishes on tape She smiles then looks over
and sees her Father across the room He is alone She
steels herself and heads his way He makes eye contact
then averts his look She is approaching him about to
speak when he walks up to some friends and starts joking
with them leaving Sharon hurt humiliated

Her mother has seen this and comes to her speaking
quietly nervously
MOTHER
Dont make him talk about
anything today

SHARON
Mom I was going to fix his tie
His tie is crooked

She sighs pushing through her hurt to say

SHARON
It was a nice ceremony

MOTHER
(worried)
Yes Were running out of
chicken though Nobodys eating

the ham

SHARON
Its a great party Mom You look
happy

Some joy is allowed to surface in her Mothers face
SHARON
Thirty-five years and still in
love huh

Her Mothers look clouds a little nervous again

MOTHER
You think thats wrong dont you

SHARON

Of course not

MOTHER
I always I feel like
apologizing to you But I love
him

SHARON
I know

MOTHER

And then I feel like apologizing
to him for loving you Im the
one in the middle Im the only
one in this family who knows how
to forgive anybody

And she walks away Sharons eyes follow her surprised
and thoughtful She watches her Mother approach her
Father and straighten his crooked tie Then Kathy is
moving toward Sharon Sharon turns to her and they both
speak quietly -- at the same time

BOTH
You look great

Then they smile sad smiles Kathy gestures to her face
the faded bruise

KATHY
Tons of makeup On Larry too

They smile wryly again

SHARON
Sorry about that but I
couldnt stand him doing that to
you I took it on

KATHY
Dont worry Im not your mother
If he tries it again Im gone

Junior He knows that

They stare and Sharon gives her a hug Kathy returns it

ON LARRY
We see Larry across the room notice this hug He keeps
his expression intact for the group hes in but we see a
flare of anger in his eyes

ON SHARON

moving across the living room

She sees Larry Jr sitting alone and goes to him sits
beside the child -- who looks sad

SHARON
Whats up with you

LARRY JR
They wont let me watch TV

SHARON
Oh Well lets pretend this is

They look about the room

SHARON
(as if its a secret)

SHARON

dress Oh-oh that man gave her
a drink with something in it

The woman sips her drink and the boy smiles getting
into it

LARRY
She drank it
SHARON
Watch Shell fall down any

minute

The boy is suddenly swooped up lifted away by his
father Larry puts the boy down near the door

LARRY
Hey sport you should go play
outside

He turns to Sharon
LARRY

Stay away from my family

Then he turns to the crowd smiling a smile without
humor speaking loudly
LARRY
Hey everybody keep it down
Somebody might call the police

There is some nervous laughter people watching them now
Sharon is angry and embarrassed keeping her voice low

SHARON
Whatre you doing

LARRY
(to crowd)
Once the cops leave we can really
party
The crowd around them is all staring now -- as he turns
back to Sharon
LARRY
Why dont you give everybody a
break -- and go home

In the hushed tension that follows a GLASS falls and
SHATTERS and more people quiet down and stare Sharon
looks at her glaring brother looks at her Mother
nervously picking up the broken glass -- no support
there Angry and shaken she turns to the door

She walks to the door opens it starts to leave starts
to close the door behind her and she stops take takes a
breath battling hard against the old patterns of hurt
and anger She looks at that nearly-closed door She
pushes it open and walks back in

We see a surprised and angry look from Larry a worried
look from her Mother -- but Sharon is moving through the
crowd searching until she sees her Father She heads
toward him He sees her and walks into the kitchen
avoiding her She follows him We see Larry and his
Mother exchange an anxious look -- and then move toward
the kitchen

INT KITCHEN - DAY

thick with tears

SHARON

FATHER

And she leaves brushing past Larry and her Mother

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

moving hunting the next guest -- and she makes a

decision and walks toward them stops in the light faces

look up from his play He smiles at her She returns

the smile -- it means a lot to her and she walks on As
she reaches the gate she notices something across the
street that halts her She stops still surprised and so
pleased

HER POV

Catch is there waiting near her car watching her now
BACK TO SCENE - FULL SHOT

as Sharon walks to him so glad hes there needing him
-- but still not sure of what hes feeling about her
until she gets close and sees his eyes and the way he
opens his arms -- and they embrace and she holds on
tight eyes closed

They break the embrace still holding on searching each
others eyes

CATCH
Sorry Shar For what I said

SHARON
Me too

In a moment he gestures toward the Pogue house

CATCH
Was it bad

SHARON
They dont like me in there

CATCH
Then they dont deserve you in
there

She stares a moment more still together

SHARON
Thats a nice thing to say

CATCH
Its not a thing to say Its the
truth

She can only look away not wanting to cry

CATCH
Why do you try so hard not to cry

She stares at him again Her throat fills with tears
mouth is trembling a bit She starts quietly finally
with nothing held back -- but this is not anger as much
as mourning

SHARON
Its not fair

The tears come and she doesnt fight them emptying the
old old wound speaking through her weeping now The
first time weve seen her cry

SHARON
Its not fair Things got better
for them because of what I did
Things got better and Id still
do it Id do it all over again
And its not fair they shut me
out Its not

CATCH
No

SHARON
Its not fair I was 19 and I
didnt know what else to do I
didnt know how else to stop it
Its not fair I dont have a
family anymore

CATCH
No Its not Shar Its not

He raises his hands to her face places a palm gently on
each cheek and she covers his hands with her own and
closes her eyes They remain that way awhile Ina
moment he lightly kisses her forehead There is a depth
to his words
CATCH
Were the family Pogo

She opens her eyes staring deep into his He has said
it all -- as it is and as it will be She smiles a bit
through her tears and nods He puts an arm around her
shoulder and holds her tight against him as they walk to
