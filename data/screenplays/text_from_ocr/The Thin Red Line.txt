And Those Who Served With Him

They Live With Us
It was an act of love Those men on
the line were my family my home
They were closer to me than I can
say closer than my friends had
been or ever would be They had
never let me down and I could
never do it to them I had to be
with them rather than let them
down and me live with the knowledge
that I might have saved them Men
I now know do not fight for flag
or country for the Marine Corps or
glory or any other abstraction
They fight for one another Any man
in combat who lacks comrades who
will die for him or for whom he is
willing to die is not a man at
all He is truly damned

EXT A WARSHIP AT SEA - 1942 - DAY

A young Admiral receives an encoded message from a
radiotelegraph and interprets it for a group of Army
commanders aboard a warship An Army division must be
diverted to support the Marines on Guadalcanal an island
which none of them is familiar with but which it appears is
of critical importance in maintaining the supply route
between the United States and Australia now in the first year
of the war The Army commanders tell him that two divisions
are available each is already at sea The choice of which to
deploy is his and after a few seconds of hesitation he
makes it He asks them to return to him some day in the
future and to tell him since he must remain far from the
fighting about their experience in the ordeal to come
Soldiers in the Civil Warhe says spoke of “seeing the
Elephant” it was as though in combat a strange awesome
creature would appear whose features one could not quite
describe to anyone who had not seen it for himself He would
like to hear from them what this Elephant is

INT BRIG — DAWN

FIRST SGT WELSH sits in the brig of a warship talking with
PFC WITT a young man from Breathitt County Kentucky a
regular and formerly a regimental boxer

WELSH
I can put you up for a court-
martial or I can give you non-
judicial punishment Your choice
up or down Its a felony offense
to strike an officer -- that
includes an NCO

WITT
It aint right

WELSH
Were going to send you to a place
where you learn or you dont
Theyre going to shape you up

WITT
What did the Captain say

WELSH
Captain dont want you Company
dont want you
Welsh leaves

WITT
You fixed it that way

WELSH

You were gambling You got mad
because you lost Ive read your
record You been a loser all your
life You dont fool me Youll
never amount to nothing

(after a pause)
You hit an NCO from another unit
in a war zone Normally youd go to
Leavenworth

WITT
Baloney

WELSH
This isnt a normal situation I
worked a deal Consider yourself
lucky If this got to Battalion
youd be court-martialed Maybe
hanged

WITT
Nonsense

WELSH
A felony offense in a war zone
Ive had trouble with you since
Hawaii Youre a bad soldier Youd
let us down

The steel door crashes shut behind him

Witt

turns to the prisoner in the next cell a man named HOKE

HOKE
(after a silence)
What a jerk

WITT
Yeah Partly hes right though
I screwed up my life I thowed away
my pearl

EXT DECK OF TRANSPORT

A LEGEND appears over a DISTANT VIEW of a lovely South

Pacific island

“Guadalcanal

9 November 1942” Two transport

ships of the US Navy have sneaked up from the south in the
first graying flush of dawn to deliver fresh reinforcement

troops

For their crews this is a routine mission and one they know
well but to the men in the hold the trip is neither routine
nor known

INT SECOND FORWARD HOLD —- DAWN

CORPORAL FIFE the orderly room clerk sits against a
bulkhead sick with fear Beads of moisture cover the steel
walls The fighting men of C-for-Charlie Company pick their
wet shirts loose from their armpits look at their watches
and wait impatiently The bunks are covered with their gear
there is nowhere to sit except in the companionways On
Fifes right PVTS MAZZI and TILLS clutch their knees

MAZZI
You think well catch a fucking air
raid

TILLS

How the hell do I know All I know
them crew guys said they din’t

on this ocean like a couple fucking
ducks in these here boats that’s
what

TILLS
I already know that

MAZZI
Yeah Well brood on it Tills
Brood on it

In one place a blackjack game has been started Elsewhere
little knots of men have formed and stand or sit talking
earnestly to each other with widened eyes while hardly
hearing what is said Every so often an LCI caught wrong on
a wave BANGS against the hull and REVERBERATES through the
closed space of the dim hold an anguished STEEL CRY On
Fifes left PRIVATE FIRST CLASS DOLL is standing with
CORPORAL QUEEN a huge amiable Texan
QUEEN
Well well soon know what it feels
like

GORDON

What what feels like

QUEEN
To be shot at

DOLL
Hell Ive been shot at Hell

Doll stops in front of Mazzi and Tills He nods at the
crowded portholes

MAZZI

DOLL
(ignoring Tills)
If we do we do Whats the matter

MAZZI
Scared ‘Course I aint scared Are

DOLL

MAZZI

Okay then Shut up

Doll throws back his head and laughs and steps out through
the bulkhead

MAZZI
That guy just aint hep He’s as
unhep as a box

TILLS
You think hell get a pistol

MAZZI
Hell no he wont get no pistol

TILLS
Right now I couldnt care less
All I want is to get off this

MAZZI
Well you aint by yourself Tills
All I know I never bargained for
nothin’ like this when I signed up
in this mans Army back in the
Bronx before the war How did I

war hanh Answer me that

TILLS
You tell me Youre the hep
character around here Mazzi

MAZZI
All I know old Charlie Company
always gets screwed Always And I
can tell you whose fault it is
Bugger Steins thats who First
he gets us stuck off on this boat
clean away from our own outfit
where we dont know a fucking soul
Then he gets us stuck way down in
fourth pace on the list to get off
this son of a bitch

At the other end of the companionway CAPT JAMES STEIN talks
privately with First Sergeant Welsh

STEIN
I think our outfit looks pretty
capable pretty solid dont you
Sergeant

Welsh grins at him insolently There is a look of dark
foreboding that never leaves his face even when he grins

WELSH
Yeah -- for a bunch of slobs about
to get their ass shot off

Stein does not answer him Welsh is mad He is insane Truly
a madman and Stein never has understood him He has no
respect for anything or anybody But it doesnt really
matter Stein can afford to overlook his impertinences
because he is so good at his job

STEIN
Hello Doll Hows it going
Everything okay Feeling a little

nervous
DOLL
(warily)
No sir

Stein nods dismissing him Doll salutes and goes on out
through the watertight door wondering what Stein meant

INT FORWARD HOLD — DAWN

Furious Doll makes his way through the forward hold He does
not know how much time he still has Then suddenly he sees
a 45 hanging from the end of a bed frame Three bunks away a
group of men clusters around a nervous crap game He has to
make his move now time is running out He lifts the pistol
off the bunk frame and buckles it around his waist

VOICES
Hey you Hey soldier

Doll turns around to see two men one a PRIVATE and one a
SERGEANT coming toward him Will they turn him in

PRIVATE (DRAKE)
Thats my pistol youre wearin’
soldier

SERGEANT (KARL)
He saw you take it off the bunk So
dont try to lie out of it
soldier

Doll forces a slow cynical grin to spread across his face
Slowly he undoes the belt and passes it over

DOLL
How long you been in the Army
mack You ought know better than to
leave your gear layin around like
that You might lose it someday

Both men stare back at him their eyes widening slightly as
the new idea new attitude replaces their own of righteous
indignation

SERGEANT (MARL)
Well you better not have such
sticky fingers soldier

DOLL
Anything layin around out in the
open that loose is fair game to
me And to any other soldier Tell
your boy he oughtnt to tempt
people so much

SERGEANT (MARL)
Hear that Drake You better take
better care of your gear

DOLL
Yeah He sure better Or he wont
have it long

INT LOWER FORWARD HOLD —- DAWN

Outside in the hatchway area Doll stops and laughs It was
all one big lie Entering the bunk area on the deck above
everything works perfectly for him On a field pack at the
edge of the companionway he sees not one but two pistols
There is not a man in this entire end of the bunk area That
is all there is to it All Doll has to do is step over pick
up one of the pistols and put it on

INT SECOND FORWARD HOLD —- DAWN

Doll returns to C-for-Charlie in the second forward hold
Tills Mazzi and Fife have not moved Doll steps up with his
hands on his hips his right one resting on the pistol

MAZZI
Hello lover-boy Where you been

DOLL
Around Well what do you think

MAZZI
Think of what

DOLL
Nothin The war

He turns on his heel and goes on inside among the bunks

TILLS
Well what do you say now hep guy

MAZZI
Just what I fucking said before
The guys a jerkoff

TILLS
Hes got a pistol
MAZZI
So hes a jerkoff with a pistol
TILLS
While youre a hep guy without a
pistol
MAZZI

Thats right Whats a fucking
pistol Leave it Tills leave it
You wanna do somethin go do

TILLS
I think I will

MESS SERGEANT STORM has gathered his cooks for a bull
session

WELSH
(grinning crazily)
What are you doing with that
fucking pistol Doll

DOLL
What pistol

WELSH
This pistol

Welsh grabs the pistol on Dolls hip and with it pulls Doll
slowly forward and slowly the grin fades from Welshs face

DOLL
Well I

WELSH
And what if somebody comes around
here to Capt Stein and wants to
search this outfit for a stolen
pistol Ey Have you ever thought
of that And what if I then
knowin who had it was forced to
tell Bugger Stein where it was
Huh Have you thought of that too

DOLL
Would you do that Top

WELSH
You bet your sweet ass I would

Welsh bellows it with startling suddenness right into his
face The CRASH of the landing craft against the hull
continues relentless and unnerving

DOLL
Well -- Do you think anybody’11
come around

WELSH
No I dont

Then as slowly as it disappeared the sly ominous grin
comes back over the sergeants face He lets Doll go and all
in the same motion flings the holstered pistol away from
him

WELSH
Clean it Its probly dirty Any
mand leave it layin arounds a
fuckass soldier anyway

Wherever his glance falls the nearby men beneath it stir
uneasily and drop their eyes and fall to doing something
adjusting a strap checking a tie-rope rubbing a riflestock

INT SECOND FORWARD HOLD —- DAWN

Fife sits to Bells right sunk in melancholy BELL is a
strong quiet-voiced private

FIFE
(after a pause)
I read in your 201 file you were an
officer before the war

SELL
You told anybody else

FIFE
No Howd you end up a private

BELL
Because of my wife I was in the
Corps of Engineers wed never been
separated before not even for a
night I took it for four months
and then I quit Resigned

FIFE
Yeah

BELL
They sent me back to the States
They told me Id never get another
commission they said theyd see to
it that I got drafted and that Id
for damn sure be in the Infantry
We had eight months together

FIFE
Why the sons of bitches Where is
she now

BELL

Home With her folks How old are
you Fife

FIFE
Twenty-two

BELL
Well Im thirty

FIFE
Why dont you want any of the guys
to know

BELL
Enlisted men dont like officers
The only reason Ive told you is so
youll know why I dont want it
mentioned

WELSH
(appearing suddenly)
All right fuckface Wheres that
platoon roster I told you to fix up
for me

FIFE
(indignantly)
I already did it I made it up and
turned it in to you Welsh

WELSH
You what You did no such fucking
thing Fife I dont have it do I

INT LATRINE — DAWN

He signals Fife to follow him around a corner into the
latrine There he backs Fife up against the wall

WELSH
You think youre a big grown-up
man but youre gust a punk kid --
a coward There’s nowhere you can
run now Youre in a box A moving
box Youve never learned that your
life and you -- they dont mean a
goddamned thing to the world and
they never will

INT SECOND FORWARD HOLD —- DAWN

Suddenly the KLAXON HORN goes off RESOUNDING through the
CLANGING overheated hold and deafening everybody -- an
immense sound that causes everyone to jump even Welsh

WELSH
Get your gear and shape up

NONCOMS (0S)
All right Off and on Drop your
cocks and grab your socks

Everybody struggles into their equipment Bulging in all
directions they find the stairs difficult to navigate

DALE (2ND COOK)
Geez my ass is draggin’ All this
gear

STORM
Mor’n your ass’1l be draggin’ soon

EXT DECK OF TRANSPORT —- DAY

They emerge at last into the sunshine and fresh sea air on
deck Looking up to the bridge Capt Stein sees LT COL
GORDON TALL the Battalion Commander They exchange salute

By squads and by platoon the men go over the side and
clamber down the four-story-high side of the ship on the nets
and into the chain of LCIs that shuttle back and forth from
the shore

EXT ABOARD MOVING LCI —- DAY
The ASST PILOT salutes them in best naval officer style

ASST PILOT
Well look what we got here Your
outfits lucky Old Nippyll be
comin along in about fifteen
minutes

TILLS
How do you know

ASST PILOT
Just got news from the airstrip
Transports mustve been spotted
Youre getting off just ahead of
time Youre lucky

Fife grabs the gunnel to keep his balance in the jouncing
swaying craft and looks back at the dwindling ship

WELD
But wont the fighter planes --

ASST PILOT
They always get some of them But
some always get through Jerk the
lead

Ahead Doll sees the shore and sand beach and coco palms
gradually coming closer Beyond them lies the dark green band
of jungle with the mass and power of the mountains rising
behind it to rocky peaks

PILOT
Grab holt and prepare to land
Everybody out No transfer slips

EXT GUADALCANAL SHORE —- DAY

Suddenly they are stumbling through the water The ramp is
already rising as the craft goes into reverse and pulls back
out to go for another load Fife expects some protest some
visible sign of enemy resistance but not a shot is fired

They dart across the beach to the line of coco palms
thrashing dryly in the mid-morning breeze There they rest
waiting for orders from Battalion Didnt the Army know there
were no Japanese here

If they failed to realize this what else dont they know
Two SCOUTS come scampering out of the grove up ahead and
report to Capt Stein

FIRST SCOUT
We went in about a mile sir
Didnt find nothing Some empty oil
drums A burned spot Hadnt nobody
been around there for at least a
week

Stein nods puzzled Suddenly a CRY goes up One SOLDIER
flings up an arm and yells There they are The CRY is
taken up all up and down the beach

High up in the sun-bright sky a number of little specks sail
serenely along toward the channel where the two ships lie
Presently a gentle SIGHING becomes audible Then a GEYSER of
water followed by another then another pops high up out of
the sea until at last a stick of three bombs falls almost
directly alongside an LCI that is just putting off When the
spout of water subsides they see there is nothing left of
the LCI only a few figures bobbing in the water who under
the weight of their full packs rapidly become fewer

EXT FIELD DRESSING STATION - DAY

The survivors of the destroyed LCI are landed by a rescue

boat not far from C-for-Charlie Company and gently led or
carried up from the beach to a nearby field dressing station
Some of them are still vomiting seawater from their ordeal C-
for-Charlie drifts up toward the dressing station consumed
with a morbid curiosity DALE the muscular intense second
cook with perpetually snapping eyes makes the only comment

DALE
They should of let them have it
with the antiaircraft from the
ships They could of got a lot more
of them If Id been there and had
my hands on one of them forty
millimeters Id of let them have
it orders or no orders Thats
what Id of done

MAZZI
Youd shit too
EXT MANGROVES AND BEACH ROAD - DAY

They trudge through the mangroves to their bivouac led by
the Route Guide from regimental headquarters

The roads are seas of soft mud axle-deep on the trucks It
is impossible to march on or in them The only way for the
men to move ahead at all is to travel in two lines one on
either side picking their way over the great rolls of drying
mud turned back as though by a plow Staggering and
senseless with exhaustion they march on By the time they
reach their bivouac it has begun to rain

EXT COCONUT GROVE BIVOUAC - DAY

C-for-Charlie works doggedly to set up camp The rain comes
straight down unbreathed-upon by any wind in huge fat
drops so close together that it seems a solid sheet of water
Turning around Fife sees that some of the men (Marl among
them) are playing in the mud sitting down and sliding around
like children in snow clowning and laughing

INT ORDERLY ROOM TENT - DAY
Welsh enters the orderly room tent and nods at Capt Stein

WELSH
Sir the companys allotment of
eight-man personnel tents hasnt
arrived from the ship

STEIN
Have the men break packs and put
up their shelter tents
(as Welsh grins)
Goddamn it Sergeant I know its a
ridiculous order too Now go and
tell them Thats an order

WELSH
Yes sir
EXT BIVOUAC - DAY

Welsh has given the men Steins order with sardonic relish
and they are setting about it

MAZZI
Hes nuts Plain fucking nuts

Tills sits on a five-gallon water can buttoning their shelter
halves together Mazzi gathers their combined ten tent pegs
having stretched the wet ropes as best he can
MAZZI
You think these goddamn little old
pegs going to hold in this muck I
was company commander of this
company thered be a lotta changes
around here and pretty damn
fuckin quick And up yours Tills
You about finished there

TILLS
Look Mazzi I want to ask you

MAZZI
Germs Sure theres germs

TILLS
You really think so

MAZZI
Why hell yes Dont you read the
papers This islands loaded with
all kinds of germs And where do
you find germs In dirt Malaria
germs

TILLS
(interrupting)
Malaria germs are in the
mosquitoes

MAZZI
Sure but where do they get them
From dirt Theres --

TILLS
No They get them from other people
who got malaria

MAZZI
Okay sure But where they come
from first Everybody knows germs

Youll probly be sick as a dog
tomorra Tills

TILLS
Youre a son of a bitch Mazzi

MAZZI
Who Me Whatd I do You ast me a
question I answered it for you
(MORE)

You din’t Mand4de aiuwn Ghd slidin’
around in that mud did you Sure
I laughed I cheered them on That
didnt cost me nothin’ Trouble
with you Tills you’re a jerkoff
Youre awys gettin’ sucked into
somethin’ Take a lesson kid You
dont see me gettin’ sucked into
nothing

Around them other men are working and other shelter tents
are going up in long even lines The ground is a soggy mire

Doll the proud pistol thief swaggers over to his pal Fife
who has just finished putting up the tent which he shares
with his assistant PFC BEAD Bead is a draftee a healthy
eighteen-year-old from Iowa the youngest man in the outfit

DOLL
We still got a couple of hours
before sundown Bunch of us is
goin’ to look at the jungle Wanta
come

FIFE
I dont know if I ought to The
sergeant might need me around here
for something

BEAD
Ill go Doll I11 go

DOLL
You aint invited

BEAD
Whada you mean I aint invited
Anybody can go that wants to cant
they

Doll leaves Bead is crestfallen

FIFE
Never mind him

EXT JUNGLE - DAY

A dozen of the men from C-for-Charlie -- among them Big

Queen the huge Texan and Private Bell the former officer --
approach the high wall of jungle curiously and gingerly
Parrots screech from nowhere startling them Huge vines and
creepers hang from the canopy in great festooning arcs

Giant tree trunks tower straight up far above their heads
their thin blade-like roots often higher than a mans head
Other POVs a skull shrine a wood carving of a man the
features of whose face have been eroded by the weather a
python strange tropical fruits some split open by raiding
ants

Suddenly Queen discovers a bloodstained shirt For a moment
he thinks of saying nothing He could pass it by and none of
the rest of them would know But noticing his strange
hesitation the MAN next to him sees it too and raises a
shout The other men who instinctively have spaced
themselves out at five-yard intervals as if in a skirmish
line cluster around and peer excitedly

VOICES

(Gordons esp)
Is it American Fuck yes its
American The Japs dont wear khaki
like that Thats chino Thats not
even Marine khaki Thats Army
chino Well the Americal
Divisions here Maybe hes one of

them

QUEEN
Whoever he was he was hit pretty
bad

THORNE

Whered it hit him

GORDON
It keyholed out the back

PRIVATE GORDON one of the men nearest it leans down
silently and picks it up with a thumb and forefinger as if
afraid he might catch a terrible disease from it

QUEEN
Leave it where you found it

Without a word Gordon who still holds it by thumb and
forefinger as if it might contaminate him turns and swings
it and lets it go

THORNE
Yeah leavem lay

The chow WHISTLE sounds clear and shrill through the trees
It is an intensely familiar curiously heart-wringing sound

EXT MESS TENT — DAY

Tonight C-for-Charlie receives its first dosage of Atabrine
Standing by the Lister bag at the head of the chow line
Storm doles out the yellow pills himself chaffing everyone
good-naturedly but determined that nobody is going to avoid
taking his medicine

WELSH
What the fuck do you bother so hard
for

STORM

Because they going to need all the
help they can git

WELSH
They going to need a lot more than
that

STORM

I know it

The last man in the line has stopped and is looking back at
them listening one of the draftees

WELSH
On your way bud

STORM
(shaking his pills)
Some of them so dumb they actuly
wouldnt take them If I didnt
make them

WELSH
So what They dont take them
maybe theyll get malaria so bad
they1l get themself shipped out
and save their useless life

STORM
They aint learned that yet They
will

WELSH

Well be ahead of them Wont we
Well make them fucking take them
Wont we You and me We know the
secret dont we We already know
about not taking them Gimme one

Storm holds out the box Without taking his eyes from Storms
face Welsh reaches down gets a pill and thumbing the
surface dust off it pops it into his mouth Not to be
outdone Storm gets one himself and swallows it as Welsh has
dry

WELSH
You know what it is dont you You
realize whats happening There

aint any choice It aint going to
get any better either This wars
just the start You understand

that
STORM
Yeah
WELSH
Then remember it Storm remember
it

Bell and Fife sit by themselves eating in silence

BELL
This war is tougher on her than it
is on me Back home theres lights
and nightclubs booze More to
tempt you I havent touched
another woman since I was called
up Or talked to one I dont want
to feel the desire

STORM (0S)
Chairs on the table Closing time

BELL
We believe in each other You need
someone you can believe in

Dale complains to a willing listener about Storms
mistreatment of him Not far away Bead is blowing soap
bubbles dipping a ring in the shaving lather he has whipped
up in the bottom of his helmet

EXT SLIT TRENCH - NIGHT
The night is filled with the stitch of tropical insects The

men crouch over the weapons in total and unspeakable
insularity

FIFE
I always thought Id be as brave as
the next guy maybe even braver
But I m not You told me about your
wife Im telling you something

BELL
Everybodys scared

FIFE
Not Doll not Big Un I got to work
harder at it than they do The only
reason Im here is because I was
ashamed for people to think I was a
coward I had to find out if I was
yellow or not I never had a wife
and kids I never been to New York
I dont want to die

SELL
Nobody does

FIFE
I hope I can get back -- the way I
was -- like I came

They look up at a scuttling noise in the undergrowth at
length discover a coconut crab (End on CU of crab)

EXT COCONUT GROVE - NIGHT

Stein is writing a letter by candlelight when he hears the
noise of a Japanese plane high overhead (Washing Machine
Charlie) Suddenly the earth is SHAKING around him Panic and
an objectless fright seize him and he surges blindly out of
his tent scrambling toward a nearby slit trench

Down the long aisle of the coconut groves the KLAXONS begin
their mournful insistent belching Above three weak
searchlight beams feebly finger the sky Now and then they
see the single QUICK BLINK of an antiaircraft shell
exploding Finally there is the SHUTTERING THIN sound of
the motor or motors up there in the dark Then from the
direction of the airfield come the CA-RUMPING explosions
walking slowly toward them in great giant strides The
klaxons keep up their long monotonous insane GROWLING
protest and the antiaircraft guns PUMP their useless
laughable shells up into the night sky as the ball-shrinking
ROAR of the bombs advances

Suddenly there is a huge ear-filling impersonal rushing
FLUTTER descending like an express train then a flash of
light It is strange that only one man is wounded By all
rights there should be many more The wounded man is Pfc
Marl the Nebraska dry-dirt farmer A piece of the
daisycutter has whistled into his hole and cut off his right
hand as neatly as a surgeon could have done with a knife
When Marl yells Welsh leaps in with him and puts a
tourniquet on him until the medic can get there

MARL
Whatm I gonna do now huh Howm I
gonna work huh Howm I donna
plow huh I mean it What’m I
gonna do now huh Take it away
Get that damned thing out of here
I dont want to look at it goddamn
it Its my hand

The hand is taken away by one of the company MEDICS who is
supposed to be trained at this kind of work but actually is
not as yet and who stops to vomit behind a tree

WELSH
They make artificial ones Theyll
make you one like new

MARL
Goddamn it its easy for you

MEDIC

MARL
Sure I can walk goddamn it Fuck

Fife watches trembling within as Marl is led off into the
darkness to the battalion medical station the first actual
wounded casualty in the company

MONTAGE - WITT AND HOKE AMONG THE MELANESIANS (GUADALCANAL )

Witt and Hoke have gone AWOL and are living among the
Melanesians unconscious of the passage of the days of good
and evil The native people live content with what the earth
and sea provide them in peace and harmony Witt gets to know
two of them in particular an older man and a young woman He
marvels at this society where no one is alone or lives to
himself where all is based on family and clan

He reveals to Hoke a secret from his past and under the
influence of this revelation decides to return to C-for-
Charlie Hoke tries to discourage him from setting out but
at length joins him instead

EXT C-FOR-CHARLIE BIVOUAC - DAWN

The men of C-for-Charlie come out into the warm revivifying
safety of the sun and look into each others stubbled dirt-
caked faces to find they are changed men Faces glower and
eyes burn Suddenly Fife hears himself hailed by a man
standing some distance off near the supply tent and leaning
against a coco palm

FIFE
Well Witt By God How are you

A troublemaker with a touchy sense of honor Witt has been
busted several times and twice sent to the stockade on a
summary court-martial This makes him something of a romantic
hero to Fife who considers him the only friend besides Bell
that he has in the whole regiment He rushes over to shake
hands overjoyed to see him Witt is just as glad in his own
way All his friends are in C-for-Charlie and he likes the
reputation he enjoys here As Witt sees it everybody knows
he loves C-for-Charlie and for Welsh to ship him out while
knowing this only proves his total contempt for Welsh
correct

FIFE

Howd you find us You AWOL I been
asking around about you every day
trying to find out were you were I
thought you were in the brig How
long you been hanging around here
Why didnt you come in the orderly
tent and get me

Witts face hardens almost as though someone had modeled his
features in quick-setting cement and Fife were watching it
dry

WITT
I aint goin no place where that
poorly son of a bitch of a first
sergeant is

FIFE
Welsh Yes well Well you know I
think maybe hes changed some
Witt Since we got here
WITT
He aint never going to change Not
in no way

FI FE
Well I tell you It just wont be
the same old company Witt Going
up there without you I guess
thats why I said that

WITT

(warming up)
Fife I can tell you When I think
of old C-for-Charlie goin’ up there
into them Japs without me it like
to breaks my heart I been in this
comp’ny -- what now -- four years
You know how I feel about it It’s
my comp’ny It ain’t right that’s
all It ain’t I belong with the
company Fife old buddy

(suddenly morose)
I don’t know what I can do about
it In fact there ain’t a damn
thing

FIFE
Well I think if you went around to
Capt Stein and told him how you
feel hed arrange a transfer back
for you Bugger knows how good a
soldier you are Never was a
question of that Right now hes
feeling pretty warm and sentimental
about the company leading them
into combat and all

WITT
I caint do that

FIFE
Why not

WITT
Because I caint You know it

FIFE
I honestly think hell take you
back

WITT
Take me back Take me back They
never should of made me go

didnt need no discipline
Discipline is what you give a dog
I caint do that I wont go and
beg them I appreciate you tryin’
to help

(as Fife nods)
I mean it

FIFE
I know you do

Fife goes on carefully afraid of making him mad

FIFE
Just how bad do you want to get
back into the comp’ny

WITT
You know how bad

FIFE
Well the only way youre going to
do it is to go to Stein and ask
him

WITT
I caint do that I tell you it
aint fair It aint fair and it
aint square Any way you look at
it It aint justice Its a
traversty of justice

FIFE
Its travesty

WITT
What

FIFE
I said you pronounce it tra-ves-ty

Witt stares at him as if he had never seen him before
storm cloud with its flickers of impending electrical
discharges comes back on his face

WITT
Take off I said take off Leave
Get out

FIFE

I got as much right here as you
have

The

WITT
Fife I never hit a friend before
in my life Not without givin them
fair warnin they aint friends no

FIFE
What the hell kind of talk is that
What did I do

WITT
You and me aint friends anymore I
dont want to talk to you I dont
want to see you If you even try to
talk to me after this Ill knock
you down

FIFE
I was only kidding with you I only

WITT

chance with you in a fight and you

WITT
Thats tough Thats life Go

FIFE
Im going But youre crazy for
Gods sake I was kidding you
Youre my best friend in this
outfit I dont want to fight you

WITT
(with sadness now)
Take off

Fife does He sees that Witt is right and that he did
something terribly mean vicious and insulting something
destructive to Witts manhood Guilt closes over him like a
mustard-colored cloud

The men are inspecting a large crocodile that the 2nd
Battalion men have captured when Bugger Stein and his driver
ROAR up in the company jeep The men have heard the SOUNDS of
mortar and small arms fire off in the hills yesterday and
today growling more angrily today than yesterday

And yet when their orders finally come to go up everybody
is astonished and surprised

STEIN
Corporal Fife I want every officer
and platoon-grade noncom who isnt
out on a detail here in five
minutes Get them all Dont miss
anybody Were moving out Fife
For the line

EXT MUDDY ROADOTHER COMPANY BIVOUAC - DAY

Along the route of march the arteries of runny mud are
clotted with stalled trucks Most are abandoned sitting
silent in the mud waiting for the big tractors to come haul
them out

The foot marchers pick their way up the steep road loaded
down with full packs and extra bandoliers each company in a
ragged single file Often one of their number turns aside and
falls down Others simply faint These are dragged aside by
the men behind them

WELSH
Pick up your feet On your feet
Pick ‘em up and keep moving

Fife has the misfortune of falling out when Capt Stein is
nearby

STEIN
Up you come Fife Come on boy
You dont want to give up now

The reaction he gets is startling Fife does not get up He
leaps up As if stabbed in the ass with a needle

FIFE
You You tell me Ill be walking
when youre on your back Ill be
going when you and all these other
guys are on your knees and out

STEIN
Shut up Fife

FIFE
You and any other goddamned
officer Ill walk till I drop dead
-- and when I do I1l be ten feet
in front of your dead body Dont
you ever worry about me quitting

Staggering in his pack Fife lurches out onto the edge of the
road He does not shut up Stein does not know what to do It
is up to him to make an issue or not make one

Fife is past the point of caring He decides to do nothing
Nobody else seems to care or pays much attention they are
all too tired Looking up the road he sees a Melanesian
native with a haunted look hurrying past in the opposite
direction away from the front Then he sees that Sgt Welsh
is watching a vague smile on his face

EXT SUGAR CANE PLANTATION (DRUMSARA) —- DAY

They are walking up a line of railroad tracks that runs
through a sugar cane plantation when a GUIDE (KIRK) comes
around a bend sees them and after a couple of deep gasps
for air comes on at a quickened pace already shouting

KIRK
Where the fuck have you guys been
I been lookin all over hells half
acre for this outfit What the hell
have you been doin Youre
supposed to be on the other side
the river not here What the fuck
happened Honestly sir I been
lookin all over Youre supposed
to be clear over on the other side
the river Thats where they tole
me youd be

STEIN
Weve been following the road the
other guide showed us

KIRK
He must of made some kind of a
mistake

STEIN
He was positive about what he told
us

KIRK

Somebody up there gave him the
wrong orders Or told me wrong

Not a very auspicious beginning The men glance at each
other

STEIN
Whats it like up there

KIRK
A crazyhouse

A stirring in the grass the rustle of the sugar cane
signals the approach of danger At Kirks signal the company
stops He pulls out a grenade and stepping into the rows of
cane advances toward the source of the noise He discovers a
white cow (A feral Indo-Chinese pig They wandered loose
shellshocked )

EXT RIVER - DAY
They cross a pontoon bridge (or ford) guarded by a heavy MG
Groups of traffic-control men watch them with curious

sympathetic eyes

KIRK
You just go on from here

STEIN
There must be more instructions
than that

KIRK

I dont know nothing about none of
that All I know I was suppose to
bring you here

STEIN
Wont they send another runner for
us

KIRK

Maybe I dont know All I know is
what I told you

EXT MOUNTING ROAD (JUNGLE TO GRASSLANDS) - DAY

MUSIC enters as they begin to climb Gradually they come out
of the jungle onto the grassy slopes above SSGT STACK the
tough hard-faced old disciplinarian who leads 3rd Platoon
has suffered a collapse He the trail with his legs pressed
tightly together and his rifle in his lap shaking all over
The medics have put a tag on him and thrust a stick in his
hand

STACK
Dont go up there Youll be
killed Dont go up there Youll
be killed

The entire company has to pass him one at a time and man by
man in single file as if passing in some macabre review

EXT HILLTOP (HILL 208) - DAY

Toiling climbing with the wind behind them they have heard
no battle noises But rounding the last bend and coming
suddenly out onto the open hilltop they find themselves
immersed in a vast infernal NOISE and tumult whose source
they cannot see Men scurry here and there on obscure
missions shouting to make themselves heard above the DIN
The center of all their activity is a small group of seven
men standing together in grand isolation They are almost the
only men present wearing any insignia and all of them wear
stars or eagles on the collars of their green fatigues

For all the NOISE they are receiving very little fire Now
and then a single bullet strikes the ground in amongst them
and buries itself or goes SHRIEKING off without touching
anyone

DALE
Are those ricochets Are they
shootin’ at us

Soon they advance into a dry treeless ravine Here at last
they can see what lies ahead of them though they still have
no sense of where they are or how they are being deployed

BEAD
Is this the line Are we on the
line Maybe they dont see us
either

Fife looks this way and that to see if there is something or
someone about to shoot at him He has a singular feeling of
exposure like a man standing on the edge of a mountaintop
When first ONE BULLET and then a moment later A SECOND kick
up puffs of dust in front of him he kneels to the ground and
begins to crawl convinced some Japanese sniper has singled
him out to shoot at

Guilty and ashamed he raises his head to look around The
rest of the company is standing up walking and already ahead
of him Terrified as he is of standing up and being shot at
by some invisible party he is more terrified of being
accused for his cowardice He begins to jog toward his
company trotting bent over at the waist and carrying his
rifle at high port He smiles at the others on joining them
It comforts him unreasonably to be in their midst

And it is just here that the second man in the company is
wounded whether deliberately or by accident no one can tell
PEALE not far from Fife suddenly claps his hand to his
thigh and stops then sits down holding his leg his lips
trembling his face white

BELL
You all right Peale

PEALE
Im hit Im wounded Im hit in
the leg

MEDIC

Can you walk

PEALE
I dont think so I think my leg
hurts pretty bad You better help
me I think its goin to be a long
time before I can walk again

Stein is already calling to the men who have stopped to move
on keep going dont stop

VOICES
So long Peale Take it easy
Peale Good luck Peale

PEALE

So long you guys So long You
guys take it easy So long Good
luck you guys Dont worry about
me Itll be a long time before I
can walk good No doctors goin to
tell me I can walk on this leg
Good luck you guys

(to the Medic)
I got me a Purple Heart and I been
in combat I never even seen a Jap
but I dont care No doctors gonna
tell me I can walk on this leg for
a long time Come on lets get out
of this Before we get killed
Thatd be hell wouldnt it

EXT GRASSY RIDGE (HILL 209) - DAY

C-for-Charlie takes shelter behind a ridge Welsh goes around
telling them to buddy up for the night

MAZZI
This Tills He spent more time on
his belly than he did up on his
feet I dont see how he managed to
keep up with the rest of us Aint
that right Tills Didnt you

TILLS
I guess you never hit the dirt any
did you

MAZZI

Did you see me You fucking-A you
didnt Tills What was the use
Anybody could tell that fire wasnt
aimed fire It was stray stuff from
the ridge Could hit you just as
well layin down as standin up
Maybe better

TILLS
And I guess you wasnt never scared
even once

FIFE
I was

BEAD
So was I Scared to death I never
been so scared in my life Im
still scared right now

They all laugh even Stein and Mazzi the New York hep guy
Only Welsh does not As if to prove Fife right there is an
instants FLUTTERING sound in the air not unlike a man
blowing through a keyhole and three GEYSERS of dirt spout
into the air thirty-five yards away followed instantly by
one loud CLAP of sound There is an ant-like scramble on the
little spur as everyone tries to hit the dirt on the slope
away from the surprise Private Mazzi if not the foremost
is certainly not the last among them Tills smiles and shoots
him the finger

TILLS
You wasnt scared Not even once

MAZZI
I guess you stood up there like a
big fucking hero fuckface

They unship their entrenching tools and start digging Fife
goes over to Welsh who is preparing to dig digging Storm
FIFE

Hey First is this where you
guys’ve decided to dig in I

thought Id dig in over

here with

you guys if it was I mean I
guess its as good a place as any

He unslings his pack Welsh stops his unbuckling of straps
and looks up at Fife with a face as expressionless as

granite

WELSH

Take off Get the fuck away from
me Stay away from me kid

Storm has stopped his work to watch Fife is carried back a
step by the viciousness of the sergeants retort Somehow he
imagined their approach to combat would soften Welshs
attitude Welsh stares at him silent refusing to be drawn
into any discussion Visibly crestfallen unable to hide it
Fife turns and moves off carrying his pack by its straps

STORM
Why dont you treat the

kid decent

once in a while Hes your clerk

isnt he

WELSH
I dont mean to wind up
nursemaid I got enough

playin
problems to

occupy me Here You got some dirt
Take the shovel gimme the mattock

Mazzi is still infuriated at Tills for giving him the finger

when the mortar shells dropped in

It was an unfair advantage

because everybody ducked for cover

MAZZI

Shoot me the finger will ya I
didnt pick you for a buddy I
dont like to be buddying with a
hick from Hicksville who aint even

hep I got no choice I
right and give you good
ignore it do something
always wrong You wont
learn

TILLS
Fuck you Mazzi

treat you
advice You

MAZZI
This time Tills you tore it I
aint going to have nothing more to
do with you

TILLS
I could give a shit

MAZZI
I aint going to dig with you Im
going to dig with Sico Im going
up the ridge and fuck you Do your
own damn thinkin’

He can feel Tills looking after him as he walks up to the
crest to join his New York buddies in the lst Platoon but
he ignores him

EXT GRASSY RIDGE (HILL 209) - DAY

Fife finds Welsh alone

FIFE
Whyre you always jumping down my
throat

WELSH

Youre finally learning how
important you are to the world
kid Taken you long enough Hurts
dont it Shock to the system

FIFE
You dont believe in nothing do
you

WELSH

Youve still got illusions kid
You wont for long

FIFE
What do you believe in Sergeant

WELSH
Property Thats what theyre all
fighting over Property

Welsh takes a large Listerine bottle full of straight gin
from his musette bag tips it back and pretends to take loud
gargles for a nonexistent sore throat They look around as
PFC Gordon with his flying fox staggers up breathless
with news that sickens them all

GORDON
They found two guys from George
Compny -- I heard it from the
runner -- the Japs took em
prisoner -- stabbed ‘em with
bayonets fifty times One of ‘em
beheaded -- alive -- with a sword

E Compny found ‘im with his hands
tied behind his back -- head
sitting on his chest Theyd
stuffed his dick in his mouth

The sheer barbarity of the thing sweeps through C-for-Charlie
like a cold-water shock

DOLL
I aint never going to take a
fucking prisoner Im going to
shoot every one of them comes my
way Preferably in the guts

QUEEN
The dirty fuckers

DALE
Okay Okay Okay

The battle round the bend which they can hear but not see
has continued unabated Now for the first time whole groups
begin to return from it The attack has failed Strangers
from the 2nd Battalion drop gasping over the crest of the
ridge and lie breathing in hysterical sobs with eyes like
drilled holes dark in their outraged furious unbelieving
faces They look at C-for-Charlie with astonishment then
hasten on toward the rear

More and more keep coming in haphazard piecemeal rarely
even with their own squads hollering to them not to shoot
for Gods sake dont shoot Once inside C-for-Charlies
perimeter they simply collapse One boy sitting in a row of
five or six weeps openly like a child his forehead and hand
resting on the shoulder of the man next to him who pats him
absently while staring straight ahead at nothing with
smoldering eyes A man with semaphore flags signals the rear
None of them knows what the overall situation is or has any
idea of what is taking place anywhere except where they
themselves have been C-for-Charlie feeling shamefaced
watches quietly with a wide-eyed awed hero worship which no
one can honestly say he wants to lose if it means sharing
their experience

The division COMMANDER suddenly appears among them smiling
and talking and tries to rally their morale

GENERAL
Whoa Were not gonna let these
Japs whip us are we boys Theyre
tough but theyre not as tough as
we are are they

PVT DRAKE
General you go out there You go
out there General you go out
there

EXT HILL 209 - DAY

As the red-and-white-splashed walking wounded totter rearward
in groups trying to help each other Storm crawls over to
the hole he shares with Welsh

STORM
There aint no water left I seen
jeeploads of water cans on the way
up from the river They probably
got diverted to the rear

WELSH
Or poured out on the ground

STORM
Whichever Peoples going to have
to eat my supper dry

Welsh watches the sun drop behind the mountains Guadalcanal
is a green peaceful island not unlike Tahiti Here the
night does not fall so swiftly as it did down in the groves
below Far away Welsh sees dogs and feral pigs feasting on
the dead

BELLS DREAM- SERIES OF ANGLES (SECOND UNIT) - DN

Bell dreams of his wife MARTY He remembers the first time
they saw each other the first time their hands touched The
dream progresses She stands on a white sand beach watching
a boat sail toward a solitary island She enters a cave (In
all this we occasionally look over Bells shoulder but we
never see him face on)

EXT GRASSY RIDGE (HILL 209) BELLS SLIT TRENCH - FLARES -
DUSK

Bell wakes up with a cry that throws the Sentry in the next
hole into a panic Green flares are falling through the sky

SENTRY (0S)
I cant see anything I cant see
anything

WELSH
Dont shoot Dont shoot Wait
Dont anybody fire

BELL
It was me I had -- a nightmare

SENTRY (0S)
Well for fucks sake try and keep
it to yourself You scared the
living shit out of me

GORDON
Why dont they come What are they
waiting for Why dont they do
something

The suspense exaggerated by the THRUM of the tropical night
is unbearable There is a sudden explosion of RIFLE FIRE from
the holes on their right All around them men are hollering
happily and throwing their GRENADES and FIRING And in front
of them the empty jungle underbrush sways and RUSTLES as
though in a rainstorm and chunks of bark and wood pop from
the trees The MORTAR and RIFLE FIRE lights up the night
betraying positions hitting nothing A few more useless
thermite GRENADES are thrown and then the thick silence
resumes

EXT HILL 209 - DAWN

At dawn bearded mud-stained grimy and greasy the men rise
in their blue holes and peer around like the dead rising
from-their graves on the Last Day Some of them our water
from their canteens onto their toothbrushes to rush their
teeth

Bead has to take a crap Without saying anything to anyone
he drops all of his equipment by his hole and taking only
his GI roll of toilet paper he starts to climb the twenty
yards to the crest

EXT HILL 209 CREST - DAY

The trees begin three yards below the actual crest Bead
steps into their midst Halfway through with relieving
himself he looks up and sees a Japanese man with a bayoneted
rifle moving stealthily through the trees ten yards away

The Japanese man sees him too and turning all in one
movement begins to run at him but moving cautiously the
bayonet on the end of his rifle extended Bead still
squatting with his pants down gathers his weight under him
In desperation still not knowing which way to try to Dump
all in one movement Bead pulls up his pants over his behind
to free his legs and dives forward in a low shoestring
football tackle when the Japanese man is almost to him
tackling him around the ankles This gives Bead time to hitch
up his pants again and spring upward once more until
kneeling on his upper arms and sitting back on his chest he
begins to punch and claw him in the face and neck

Bead hears a high keening SCREAM and thinks it is the
Japanese begging for mercy until finally he slowly becomes
aware that the Japanese man is now unconscious Then he
realizes it is himself making this animal scream Sobbing and
wailing he continues to belabor the unconscious Japanese
with his fingernails and fists Then he rolls aside seizes
the enemy rifle and on his knees raises it above his head
and drives the long bayonet almost full-length into the
Japanese mans chest The Japanese mans body convulses in a
single spasm His eyes open staring horribly at nothing and
his hands flip up from the elbows and seize the blade through
his chest Bead withdraws the bayonet throws the rifle from
him and falls down on his hands and knees and begins to vomit
and weep

EXT HILL 209 - DAY

GORDON
Have a good shit

Bead is ashamed and embarrassed by the whole thing that is
the truth and that is why he doesnt want to mention it to
anybody He gets back through the lines all right without
further questions But as he approaches C-for-Charlie he is
joined by Pfc Doll on his way down from 1st Platoon

DOLL
Man alive What happened to your
knuckles You have a fight with
somebody

BEAD
No I slipped and fell

DOLL
And I spose all them little blood
splatters come from your knuckles

BEAD
Leave me alone Doll I dont feel
like talking So just leave me
alone hunh Will you

They walk on down in silence Doll has been a little taken
aback by Beads vehemence a forcefulness he is not used to
from Bead He can smell something when he sees it Seeing
Welsh and Storm he goes over to them grinning

DOLL
What the fuck happen to your boy
there Who the hell he beat up with
them skinned knuckles and all them
blood splatters on him Did I miss
somethin

WELSH
Bead come over here What happened
to you

BEAD

Who Me Well I slipped and
skinned myself thats all

WELSH
Whered you go a while ago When
you were gone for a while Where
were you

BEAD
I went off to take a crap

DOLL
Wait When I seen him he was
comin’ down from the 2nd Platoons
section of line on the ridge

WELSH

Lissen kid I got more problems
than I know what to do with in this
screwy outfit I got no time to
fuck around with kid games I want
to know what happened to you and I
want the truth Look at yourself
Now what happened Where were you

BEAD
Well I went across the ridge
outside the line A Jap guy came up
while I was there and he tried to
bayonet me And -- I killed him

Bead exhales a long fluttering breath then inhales sharply
and gulps Everyone is staring at him disbelievingly

WELSH
Goddamn it kid I told you I
wanted the goddamn fucking truth
And not no kid games

BEAD
Then goddamn you go and look Dont
take my word go and look for your
goddamn fucking self

DOLL
Ill go

WELSH
Youll go nowhere stoolie
(turning to Bead)
Ill go myself And if youre
lyin kid God help your ass All
right Where is it Come on show
me

BEAD
Im not going up there again You
want to go go by yourself But I
aint going And nothins gonna
make me

WELSH
Okay Where is it then

Storm puts on his helmet and picks up his Thompson

BEAD
A few yards beyond the crest front
of Krims hole You wont need all
the goddamned artillery Welsh
There’s nobody up there now but
him

DOLL
Top you wouldnt keep me from
goin’ would you

Welsh stares at him a moment then without change of
expression turns away silently It is obviously a reprimand
Doll chooses to take it as silent acquiescence And with
himself in the rear the search party starts the climb to the
line Meanwhile Bead confides his anguish to Fife

BEAD
He felt it He knew what was
happening I just lost my head I
was afraid I could of taken him
prisoner we could of gotten
valuable information from him
Everything I ever did I fucked up
I just wish I hadnt touched him
Now I cant never wash it off
Dont kill nobody Fife If you can
help it I swear it right now Im
never going to kill again

They look up to see the little scouting party has returned

WELSH
Hes there

DALE
He sure is

Doll has hunted up the Japanese rifle and brings it back for
Bead He presents it as if presenting an apology offering

DOLL
Here this is yours I scrubbed the
blood off with leaves I wiped off
the bayonet

BEAD
I dont want it

DOLL
You won it The hard way

BEAD
I dont want it anyway What goods
it to me

DOLL
(laying it down)
Maybe you can trade it for whiskey
And heres his wallet Welsh said
to give it to you Theres a
picture of his wife in it

BEAD
Good Lord Doll

DOLL
Theres pictures of other broads
too Filipino looks like Maybe he
was in the Philippines

BEAD
I dont want it anyway You keep
it

But he takes the proffered wallet anyway his curiosity
piqued in spite of himself He looks at it

FIFE
He feels guilty

DOLL
Guilty What the hell for It was
him or you wasnt it How many our
guys you think maybe he stuck that
bayonet in the Philippines How
about those two guys yesterday

BEAD
I cant help it

DOLL
Why

BEAD
Why How the fuck do I know why

DOLL
Listen -- if you really dont want
that wallet

BEAD
No Ill keep it I might as well

DOLL
Well -- I got to get back up to the
platoon
(admiringly)
Ill say one thing When you set
out to kill him you really killed
him

BEAD
You think so

DOLL
I aint the only one

He turns and leaves heading up the slope Bead sees the
others looking at him from afar as though he were a
different person He is not sure whether he enjoys this or
not He is not surprised when Stein comes over

STEIN
Bead I know youve been pretty
upset by what happened to you
today Thats unavoidable Anybody
would be I thought you might like
to talk about it

Kirk appears and kneels down behind Bead waiting his chance
to speak with the Captain

STEIN
You had no choice You only did
what any other good soldier would
have done for our country or any
other I want you to know that
after this war is over if there is
anything I can ever do for you
just get in touch with me Ill do
anything I can to help you

KIRK
The Colonels here to see you sir

EXT HILL 209 - DAY

Stein has received unbelievable orders from Lt Col Tall
lst Battalion Commander Tall is lean a West Pointer

STEIN
We cant do that Colonel

COL TALL
Theres no way to outflank them On
the left theres the cliff It
falls straight down to the river
The Japanese hold the bungle It
has to be taken frontally

STEIN
What about the water The waters
not getting up here My men are
passing out

Tall looks at him gives a slight nod then looks away
leaving Steins question unanswered Stein looks at his
watch The-next moment as though under a spell he explains
to his officers and noncoms what their objective is

They kneel just behind the crest Stein points out the
features of the land that lies ahead of them they inspect it
through binoculars There are three folds of land like
gentle ocean swells Beyond them lies Hill 210

STEIN
Were all going to attack abreast
Weve got to cross those three
folds of ground You see Then
once were beyond them weve got
to attack the hill

WELSH
Were supposed to cross that open
field

STEIN

(guiltily)
The Colonel says theres no way to
outflank it We have to take it
head on by frontal assault Weve
drawn the worst assignment Whyte
Blane - you see those grassy ridges
at the end of the field Just at
the foot of the hill When you get
to the end of the field youre to
locate and eliminate the hidden
strongpoints on those ridges I
cant see any sign of them but the
Japs must have something there to
protect the approaches We move
out in twenty minutes When you
hear the whistles

EXT FOLDS OF GROUND - THE ATTACK - DAY

Batteries of 105 HOWITZERS begin to blast away joined by
81mm mortars and the 155mm guns of the Americals 221st Field
Artillery Battalion-in the first time-on target attack of
the war P-39s and Air Cobras fly in low to strafe and drop
500-pound demolition bombs on the Japanese positions Stein
looks at his watch WHISTLES begin to blow up and down the
line as C-for-Charlie goes to the attack The men have no
recourse except to begin to move Minds cast frantically
about for legitimate last-minute excuses and find none
Though they prefer not to believe it the moment has come

Nervous fear and anxiety contained so long and with such
effort in order to appear brave now begins to come out in
yelled exhortations and yelps of gross false enthusiasm They
move up the slope and in bunches crouching low and carrying
their rifles in one or both hands they hop over the crest
and commence to run sideways and crouching down the short
forward slope to the flat rocky field in front

By the time Stein looks up lst and 2nd Platoons are passing
out of sight beyond the first of the swells that lies across
their line of advance They are fifty yards ahead and appear
well deployed Close by directly in front of him his
reserve 3rd Platoon is spread out and flattened behind the
first swell With them are the company HQ and the mortar
section Most of them are looking at him with blazing
astonished eyes

The lst Platoon spreads out and flattens itself behind the
middle of the three little swells of ground The 2nd Platoon
crouches in the trough behind them Gordons little flying
fox trembles inside his shirt-front

Stein moves to the first swell Young LT WHYTE peeps over
the crest at the third swell Seeing nothing he motions for
his two scouts to proceed there using an additional hand-and-
arm signal meaning speed The BOOMING and BANGING and
RACKETING in the air does not seem to come from any one place
or several places but simply hangs and jounces in the air
sourceless Whyte can see no visual end results of so much
banging and exploding His two scouts still not having moved
Whyte becomes angry and opens his mouth and bellows at them
motioning again Both of them stare at him as though they
thought him insane for even suggesting such a thing but this
time after a moment they move Almost side by side they
leap up cross the crest and run crouching down to the low
area where they flatten themselves Whyte jumps up making a
sweeping forward motion with his arm and runs forward his
platoon behind him 2nd Platoon moves to the top of the
middle swell

Back at the first swell Stein watches this move and feels a
little reassured He raises himself to his knees his face
and whole patches of his skin twitching with mad alarm to
see lst Platoon arrive at the last swell and that Lt Whyte
is on the verge of making a bad tactical blunder

It seems strange to Whyte truly astonishing that he has
arrived at the third and last fold of ground without a
casualty What are the Japanese up to

DOLL
Maybe theyve pulled out

Whyte shakes his head This would be too optimistic While
his men flatten themselves and stare at him with intense
sweating faces he raises himself cautiously on his elbows
till only his eyes show and inspects the terrain He cannot
see anything that looks like Japanese or their emplacements
Whyte is scared but his anxiety to do well today is
stronger

He takes another look at the terrain ahead -- it is such a
short distance to the first ridge of the hill -- and then
motions his scouts forward

Once again the two riflemen stare at him as though they think
he has lost his mind as though they would like to reason
with him if they didnt fear losing their reputations Again
Whyte motions them forward jerking his arm up and down in
the signal for speed It seems eerily quiet in the aftermath
of the barrage though now and then the mortars behind them
GONG away The scouts look at each other then gathering
themselves on hands and knees first bounce up and sprint
twenty-five yards down into the last of the low areas and
fall down flat After a moment in which they inspect and
find themselves still alive they gather themselves again On
hands and knees preparing to rise the first one suddenly
falls down flat and ounces the second a little way behind
him gets a little further up so that when he falls he
tumbles on his shoulder and rolls onto his back And there
they lie both-victims of well-placed rifle shots by unseen
riflemen Neither moves again Whyte stares at them shocked
He has heard no shots nor has he seen anything move What is
he supposed to do now There is nobody to tell him

WHYTE
Come on boys Let’s go get ‘em

He leaps to his feet motioning the platoon forward He takes
two step s and falls down dead stitched diagonally from hip
to shoulder by BULLETS

COOMBS
I saw him die I saw a man die

Five others of Whyte’s platoon go down with him almost
simultaneously some dead some only nicked But the impetus
Whyte has inaugurated remains and the platoon charges
blindly on Behind them over the top of the third swell
suddenly comes the 2nd Platoon in full career yelling
hoarsely Nine men fall at once Two die one of them is
their 2nd Lt Blane unluckily chosen as target by three
separate riflemen

MORTAR SHELLS begin to drop in onto the lst Platoon twenty-
five yards ahead First two then a single then three
together pop up in unbelievable mushrooms of dirt and stones
Shards and pieces wicker and WHIR in the air

In the 2nd Platoon SSgt Keck watched by everyone now with
Lt Blane down throws out his arms and bellows like the
combined voices of ten men for them to Hit dirt Hit dirt
Running men melt into the earth as if a strong wind had come
up and blown them over like dried stalks They disappear

lst Platoon reaches the bottom of the ridge a long hillock
really and dives into the waist-high grass which skirts it
hiding from the hidden MGs above them and protecting
themselves from the enemy mortars Those who cannot reach the
grass are hosed to earth and hiding by the machine guns or
bowled over stunned by the mortars before they can hide or
get close enough to the ridge to escape the fire The late
Lt Whytes nineteenth-century charge is over

Private Bell of the 2nd Platoon lies sprawled exactly as his
body has skidded to a halt without moving a muscle He
closes his eyes and listens On the little ridges the
prolonged yammering of the MGs has stopped and now confined
itself to SHORT BURSTS at specific targets Here and there
wounded men bellow whine or whimper Bell has never known
such eviscerating ball-shrinking terror

BELL
Hey Keck Hey Keck We got to get
out of here

KECK
I know it

BELL
Can you see them Can you see where
any of them are

KECK
No

BELL
What1ll we do

JAPANESE (0S)
We know you there Yank Yank we
know you there

KECK
Tojo eats shit

He is answered by an angry burst of machine gun FIRE

JAPANESE (0S)
Roozover’ eat shit

KIRK (0S)
You goddamn right he does

When the firing stops Bell calls softly again

BELL
What’1ll we do Keck

KECK
Listen All you guys listen Pass
it along so everybody knows When I
holler go everybody up Load and
lock have a nuther clip in yore
hand lst Squad stay put kneeling
position fire covering fire 2nd
and 3rd Squads hightail it back
over that fold lst Squad fire two
clips then scoot 2nd and 3rd fire
covering fire from that fold If
you can’t see nothin’ fire
searching fire Space yore shots
Them positions is about halfway up
them ridges Everybody got it Then
-- GO

The slope comes to life Bell leaps up running his legs
already pistoning before the leap comes down to earth Safe
beyond the little fold of ground which by now has taken on
characteristics of huge size he whirls and begins to FIRE
cover When 2nd and 3rd Squads come diving and tumbling back
over the tiny crest Bell is content to throw himself prone
press his cheek to the earth shut his eyes and lie there

VOICE
God oh God Why am I here

Apparently Kecks plan has worked very well 2nd and 3rd
Squads having the surprise have gotten back untouched and
lst Squad has had only two men hit Bell is looking right at
one of them as running hard with his head down the man (a
boy named KLINE) jerks his head up suddenly his eyes wide
with start and fright and cries out Oh his mouth a round
pursed hole in his face and goes down Anguished cries of
Medic Medic are beginning to be raised now here and there
across the field

Back at the CP behind the first swell Stein watches Seeing
that their Captain can safely stand up on his knees without
being pumped full of holes or mangled others are now doing
it He is setting them a pretty good example Stein thinks
still a little astonished by his own bravery He calls his
two company AIDMEN over

STEIN
You two fellows better get on up
there I expect they need you

FIRST MEDIC
Yes sir

STEIN
Go by rushes if you think you have
to
(as they disappear )
I need a runner A volunteer

Not a single figure moves to come forward or answers him
Stein stares back at them disbelieving

STEIN
I -- cant see what happened up
there I need someone to go up
there and find out whats happened

Charlie Dale the second cook appears at his elbow scowling
with intensity his face dark and excited

DALE
Ill go sir

Stein watches him go trotting off bent over at the waist
then looks back at the rest of them somewhat restored There
are now twelve men standing on their knees in a group around
Stein trying to see what is going on up front Fife is not
however one of these Fife is absolutely flattened out as he
can get staring at flies stirring in the grass His rage is
broken off short by the buzzing WHISTLE of the soundpower
phone that Stein has given him care of

FIFE
Yes

COL TALL (VO)
What do you mean yes

FIFE
I mean this is Charlie Cat Seven
Over

COL TALL (VO)
Thats better This is Seven Cat
Ace Colonel Tall here I want
Captain Stein Over

FIFE
Yes sir He’s right here
(to Stein)

Colonel Tall wants you

Stein lies down and takes the phone Despite the din both he
and Fife beside him can hear the colonel clearly Stein has
been caught off guard

he did not expect to be called upon to offer explanations so
soon What he hears astounds him to speechlessness

COL TALL (VO)
Magnificent Stein magnificent
The finest thing these old eyes
have seen in a long time
Beautifully conceived beautifully
executed Youll be mentioned in
Battalion Orders Stein Your men
came through for you Over

STEIN
Yes sir Over

COL TALL (VO)
Best sacrificial commitment to
develop a hidden position I have
ever seen outside maneuvers Young
Whyte led beautifully Im
mentioning him too I saw him go
down in that first melee Was he
hurt bad But sending in your 2nd
too was brilliant They might very
well have carried the ridge with
luck I dont think they were hurt
too bad Blane led well too How
many of the emplacements did they
locate Did they knock out any We
ought to have those ridges cleaned
out by noon Hello Hello Stein
Over

STEIN
Yes sir Here sir Over

COL TALL (VO)
Thought youd been hit I said how
many of the emplacements did they
locate Did they knock any of them
out Over

STEIN
I dont know Over

COL TALL (VO)
What do you mean you dont know
How can you not know Over

Stein finds himself in a quandary He cannot admit what both
he and Fife know which is that he knows nothing about
Whytes attack did not order it and until now has believed
it bad

STEIN
Im back here Behind the first
swell Do you want me to stand up
And wave Over

COL TALL (VO)
No I can see where you are I want
you to do something I want you to
getup there and see what the
situation is Stein I want Hill
210 in my hands tonight To do that
I have to have those two ridges by
noon The Admiral got up at dawn
for this Come to life down there
Stein Out

STEIN
(to Welsh)
Lets move up

While Steins Company HQ is trooping forward to the second of
the swells the lst Platoon continues to lie flat After the
first crash and volley and thunder of mortars they all
expected to be dead in five minutes Now it seems
unbelievable but the Japanese do not seem to be able to see
them very well

The two company aidmen have moved courageously up amongst 2nd
Platoon and begun little sorties out after the wounded In
all there are fifteen wounded men and six dead The aidmen
do not bother with the dead but slowly they retrieve for the
stretcher-bearers all of the wounded

Bell watches them astonished With insouciance the two of
them move up and down the slope of the last swell bandaging
and salting dragging and half-carrying MORTAR SHELLS knock
them down MG FIRE kicks up dirt around them but nothing
touches them They clump untouchably on helping the sobbing
near-helpless men

EXT HILLSIDE (WITT AND HOKE AMONG THE WOUNDED) - DAY

Witt works as a stretcher-bearer He receives the wounded
from the aidmen and does what he can to comfort them They
bleed They cry They beg for water He puts his canteen to
their lips he listens he smooths their hair He feels
strangely close to them

The other men look on the wounded with fear and a hushed awe
They keep their distance though they cannot help but be
curious fresh blood is so very red It is all obscene
somehow

Something which they feel should not be looked at but which
they are compelled to look at with guilty darting glances

EXT GRASS AT THE FOOT OF THE RIDGE —- DAY

It is Doll who sees the first Japanese Sensing the movement
around him as men begin to stir and call softly to each
other he raises his head until his eyes show above the
slight depression into which he has sprawled He sees three
figures carrying what could only be a machine gun still
attached to its tripod start across the slope back toward
Hill 210

Doll slides his rifle up raises the sight four clicks and
lying with only his left arm and shoulder outside his little
hole sights on the man in front leading him a little and
squeezes off a SHOT The rifle bucks his shoulder and the man
goes down The two men behind jump sideways together like a
pair of skittish delicately coordinated horses and run on

DOLL
I got him I got him

Doll has killed his first Japanese For that matter his
first human being of any kind He feels an impulse to grin a
silly grin and to laugh

All at once a mortar shell SIGHS down and ten yards away
EXPLODES in a fountain of terror and dirt and Doll discovers
his confidence hasnt been helped so much after all After a
moment he again puts his head up a little This time he sees
four Japanese preparing to leave the grassy ridge and head up
toward the top of Hill 210 They come into si Doll from
somewhere on the ridge already running Doll pulls his rifle
up into position and fires off FOUR SHOTS He misses each
time The Japanese disappear into the rocks

DOLL
Hey Queen You there You see them
Japs leavin’ that left ridge

QUEEN
I ain’t been seein’ much of
nothin’

DOLL

Well why dont you get your
fuckin’ head up and look around

QUEEN
Go fuck yourself Doll

DOLL
No Im serious I counted seven
Japs leavin’ that left-hand grassy

ridge I got me one of ‘em

QUEEN
So

DOLL
I think theyre pullin’ out of
there Maybe somebody ought to tell
the Captain

QUEEN
You want to be the one

DOLL
Why not Sure Ill carry the
message back to Bugger for you

QUEEN
Youll do no such goddamn fucking
thing Youll stay right the fuck
where you are and shut up Thats
an order

Doll does not answer for a moment Slowly his heart returns
to normal He offered and he was refused

QUEEN
They1l get us out of this ina
little bit Somebody will You stay
put Im ordering you

But the thing that is driving Doll eating on him doesnt
recede He has a strange tingling all through his belly and
crotch Off to his right there is a sudden burst of MG FIRE
his ear now knows as Japanese and immediately after it a CRY
of pain

DOLL
Sounds like Stearns

STEARNS
Not my legs Not my legs Aidman
Aidman Ill be all right Just
show me where to go

The tingling in Doll gets stronger and his heart begins to
pound again He has never in his life been excited quite like
this Somebody has to get that news to Bugger Somebody has
to be a -- hero And at once he goes up in a flash and
running bent over his rifle in both hands

A BULLET kicks up dirt two feet to his left and he zigs
right Ten yards further on he zags left Then twenty yards
further he nearly collides with Dale who is just coming up
to get their news

DOLL
Where you going fuckface

DALE
Im s’pose to find out whats going
on with you people

DOLL
They sendin’ out cooks They must
be in bad shape back there

He hurries on past Dale without even looking back Dales
ears burn with the unprovoked insult A feral pig flushes
from its hiding place in the bushes nearby Dale SHCJTS at it
but misses

Behind the second little swell Doll runs almost head-on into
Capt Stein He comes trotting up bent over giggling and
laughing so out of breath he cannot talk Welsh eyes him
contemptuously

STEIN
What are you laughing at

DOLL
I think theyre pullin’ completely
out of there sir

STEIN
Who sent you back here

DOLL
Nobody sir I came myself I
thought it was something youd want

to know

STEIN
Youre right It is I wont forget
it Doll

Doll does not answer but grins and turns to Fife

DOLL
That was exciting More than all
the hunting gambling and fucking I
ever done All rolled up together
STEIN
God damn it get down George get
a man with glasses and have him
spot the back of that ridge I want
to know the second anybody leaves
it Take mine

LT BAND
Ill do it myself

Stein gives his binoculars to lst Lt Band his

exec then

turns back to Doll and begins to question him about the
attack casualties the present position of the platoon
While they are talking Welsh looks over the crest at the 2nd
Platoon flattened out and looking back this way watching
their commander who conceivably might order them to go over

the crest again

STEIN
Youre not really pinned down
then I was told --

DOLL
Well we are in a way sir But
like you see I got back all right
We couldnt all come back at once
But two or three at a time could
make it I think With 2nd Platoon
firing covering fire

STEIN
We dont even know where those
goddamned fucking emplacements are

DOLL
They could fire searching fire
couldnt they

Stein glares at him So does Welsh Welsh wants
new hero in the ass already giving the company
advice

WELSH
Capn You want me to go out there
and get them men back here for you

STEIN
No No I cant spare you Might
need you Anyway I think Ill
leave them there a while

(MORE)

to boot the
commander

They dont SSaW (taorme dotting hurt
too bad and if we can get up onto
that right ridge frontally maybe
they can flank it

LT BAND
Hey Jim Hey Captain Stein I
just saw five more leaving the left
ridge with two MGs I think they
really are pulling out

STEIN
Really Really

Now he hears a voice behind him and looks around to see Dale
staring at him with his narrow close-set eyes snapping
bright

DALE
Captain are there any more jobs
you got for me to do

STEIN
Yes Dale You --

Stein is interrupted by the EXPLOSION of a mortar shell
amongst the 2nd Platoon on the swell just ahead of them Its
thronging bang is almost simultaneous with a loud SCREAM of
pure fear A man has thrown himself out of the line back down
the slope and is bucking and kicking and rolling with both
hands pressed behind him in the small of his back

WELSH
I dont think they can see us any
better than we can see them

The screaming takes on a new tone one of realization rather
than the start and surprise and pure fear of before One of
the aidmen rushes out to Jacques and with the help of two
men from 2nd Platoon tears open his shirt and gets a syrette
of morphine into him In a few seconds he quiets The aidman
shrugs with despair Stein is white-faced his lips tight
This is the first of his men he has actually seen wounded

STEIN
Stretcher-bearers I believe thats
Private Jacques

LT BAND
But Jim Really Jim I dont --
Theres other men wounded

STEIN
God damn you George shut up
Leave me alone

The stretcher-bearers arrive out of breath Stein points over
the crest to where the aidman still kneels by the casualty

STEIN
Go get that man

Hoke the lead stretcher-bearer plainly thought someone of
the CP group here was wounded Now he sees his mistake

STRETCHER-BEARER (HOKE)
We already got eight or nine down
there now that were not supposed
to -- Were not --

STEIN
God damn it dont argue withe me
Im Captain Stein Go get that man
I said

Hoke recoils upset Of course nobody is wearing insignia

LT BAND
But Jim really hes not --

STEIN
God damn you all of you Am TI in
command around here or not Am I
company commander of this outfit or
am I not Am I a captain or a
goddamned private Do I give the
orders here or dont I That man
may die Hes hit bad Get him back
to Battalion Aid Station See if
they cant do something to save
him

STRETCHER-BEARER (HOKE)
Yes sir We got others that’re hit
bad sir That was all I meant We
got three down there might die any
minute

LT BAND
Thats it Jim Dont you see
Dont you think he ought to wait
his turn Isnt that only fair

STEIN
Wait his turn Wait his turn Fair

LT BAND
Why put him ahead of some other
guy

STEIN

Go and get him like I told you
Back to Battalion Aid Station I
gave you an order Private

STRETCHER-BEARER (HOKE)
Yes sir Come on you guys Were
goin’ after that guy

STRETCHER-BEARER (WITT)
Well what the hell’re we waitin’
for Come on Hoke Or are you
afraid of gettin’ that close to the
shooting

STRETCHER-BEARER (HOKE)
You shut up Witt Let me alone

The man he has addressed stands up suddenly With a rapacious
grin he marches up to where Welsh half-reclines

WITT
Hello Firs’ Sarn’t

Only then do Stein or any of the rest of the C-for-Charlie
men for that matter recognize that this Witt is their Witt
the same that Stein and Welsh combined to transfer out of the
company All of them are astonished as Witt has obviously
meant for them to be

FIFE
By God Hello Witt What’re you
doing here

True to his promise of a few days before Witt passes his
narrow eyes across his friend as if Fife did not exist They
come to rest on Welsh again Welsh seems to peer into him

STORM
You must be out of your mind You
must be crazy

WELSH
Hi Witt You in the medics now
You better get down

Stein who has felt guilty about shipping Witt out when he
knew how badly Witt wanted to stay even though he still
feels he did what was best for his company says nothing

Witt ignores Welshs cautioning and remains standing straight
up

WITT
Naw Firs’ Sarn’t Im still in
Cannon Comp’ny Where you put me
Only we ain’t got no cannons Who
we goin’ after over there Firs’
Sarn’t

WELSH
Jacques

WITT
Old Jockey Shit thats too bad

His three companions have already gone on and are now running
downhill toward the wounded man Witt turns to follow them
but then he turns back and speaks directly to Stein

WITT
Please sir can I come back to the
company After we get Jockey back
to Battalion I can slip away easy
Theyll give Hoke another man Can
I sir

STEIN
Well I -- Of course youll have
to get permission

WITT
Sure And my rifle Thank you sir

He exchanges a look with Welsh who turns to Stein as though
to protest this decision Then continuing to ignore Fife he
turns and follows after his companions Stein stares after
him For a man to want to come back into a forward rifle
company in the midst of an attack is simply incomprehensible
In a way though it is very romantic -- like something out
of Kipling

Fife lies flat and shuts his eyes Even though he knows that
Witts gesture of ignoring him has to do with their argument
of a few days back he cannot help taking it as contempt and
disgust for his present cowardice -- as if Witt with one
glance had looked inside his mind When he reopens his eyes
he finds himself looking into the pleading white face of
little Bead a few feet away
DALE
First chance I hadda be free of
that goddamn Storm and all them
cooks cooking up a bunch of shit
for people to gorge their guts on
First chance I had to talk to the
Compny Cmander personally like
this

Fife looks at him in astonishment For one thing
long time since anyone heard Charlie Dale string this many
sentences together He really does seem to be enjoying it
especially watching Storm all flattened out beside Sgt

Welsh

DALE
People are starting to rekinize me
(glancing at Storm)
Hour ago that dumb fuck was giving
me orders

STEIN

We know the Japs have vacated the
ridge on the left Dale you go to
3rd Platoon tell them to move up
and occupy it Report to Lieutenant
Gore if you can find him Tell him
I dont want to lose any more men
than he has to Get back as soon as
you can

DALE
Aye aye sir

STEIN
I want both you and Doll to stay
with me Ill have further work for
both of you Youve both been
invaluable

DALE
Yes sir

Dale snaps out a tiny little salute and takes
bent over along the low area behind the fold

STEIN
The ridge on the right is going to
be the trouble spot The main
strongpoint is there Doll you go
back and tell 1st Platoon I want
them to fire cover Go

off

it isa

running

Doll moves off reluctantly He did not intend when he first
came back to set himself up as a troubleshooting messenger
to dangerous areas for Bugger Stein

STEIN

2nd Platoon will make the attack
Sgt Keck as 2nd Platoon leader
youre to lead it

(guiltily)
Youll take three squads and attack
up the ridge It wont be easy
Crawl up the slope as far as you
can get until they discover you
Then attack The rest of us will
move forward to support you Were
going after them men

Keck listens astonished It will be a frontal attack
uphill under heavy fire

Meanwhile Doll passes up through 2nd Platoon at the third
swell The men cheeks pressed to the earth stare at him
with indifferent sullen curiosity He is aware that his eyes
are narrowed his nostrils flared his jaw set He makes a
handsome picture of a soldier for the 2nd Platoon men who
watch him Then he is up and running Some bullets kick up
dirt to right and left He zigs and zags Finally just ahead
of him he sees a hand and arm shoot up into the air the
hand describing the old circular hand-and-arm signal for
Gather here Doll pulls up to find Queen lying placidly on
his side and grinning up at him ruefully his rifle hugged
against his chest

QUEEN
Come right in

EXT SECOND FOLD TO THIRD FOLD —- DAY

Stein begins to move forward Patches of flesh on his face
twitch uncontrollably From behind the third swell he will
mount the attack and observe it too He wonders if the men
can tell his nerves are wearing thin In the first place he
can never be sure that what he is doing is right might not
be done better and with less cost in some other way Danger
flickers and blinks in the air like a faulty neon tube
Whenever he stands up he might be struck by a bullet
Whenever he moves a few feet he might be moving under a
descending mortar shell

He is turning these things over in his mind when Fife holds
the phone up to his ear He is dumbfounded to hear the
Colonel shouting at him that he is too far to the right

He is not even given an opportunity to explain his proposed

attack

STEIN
I dont understand What do you
mean -- too far to the right

Theyve evacuated the left-hand
grassy ridge My 3rd Platoons
moving up to occupy it Over

COL TALL (VO)

God damn it Stein Im telling you
your left flanks exposed Do you
know what it is to expose your
flank Did you ever read ina
tactics manual about exposing your
left flank Damn it youve got to
move down there Youre not moving
Over

STEIN
God damn it Colonel right now as
you call were moving out to
attack the right-hand grassy ridge
Over God damn it

COL TALL (VO)
Stein youre too far right
already Youre sideslipping to the
right alla time Ive decided to
commit the reserve company on your

left -- with orders to attack
Orders to attack Stein you hear
Over

STEIN

Do you want me to go ahead with my
attack Over

COL TALL (VO)
What else What else Stein Youre
not supposed to be down there on a
goddamned asshole vacation Get
cracking Out

Stein looks over the terrain that lies ahead of them He
points its geography out to Band Welsh and Keck

STEIN
The first problem will be getting
the men from here across that
bareass field to the foot of the
ridge Itll be safer there
(MORE )

Well be rS®INicanfaihst them too
close to hit us with their MGs and

mortars Theres your ridge Keck

You see

Suddenly Dale appears running bent over at the waist in that
peculiar fashion everybody instinctively adopts Rifle and MG
FIRE hit the ground all around him but nothing touches him
and he arrives among them a hero Everyone within reach slaps
him on the back as he makes his way to Stein to give his
report

DALE
They’re okay 3rd Platoons
occupied the ridge on the left

Stein sees a lone figure hurry toward him It is Witt with
his rifle and some extra bandoliers At the same time Pfc
Doll returns from his hazardous mission to lst Platoon
Everything is building toward the moment of truth

DOLL
Found Queen Theyre ready

STEIN
Dale if you want to go out with
these others when they make the
attack Ill make you an acting
sergeant right now and put you in
command of the extra squad Do you
want to do that

DALE
Sure Sure sir If you think Im
capable sir If you think I can do
it

STEIN
Okay I make you an acting
sergeant Youll go with the
others Under the command of Keck

here
DALE
Aye sir But dont you have to say
hereby
STEIN
What
DALE

I said dont you have to say
hereby You know to make it
official

In some slow-stirring labyrinthine depth of his animals
mind Dale seems to be suspicious of Steins honesty

STEIN
No I dont have to say anything
but what Ive said Youre an
acting sergeant

Dale turns to Doll and grins While Doll gathers his breath
and stricken sense of justice Witt asks permission to join
the attack force He seems to enjoy Welshs look of
exasperation

WITT
Can I go sir Im ready

DOLL
Can I go too sir

Stein unable to hide his stunned disbelief nods his
agreement It gives him a terrible feeling of moral
culpability to choose which men to send in Some of them will
surely die and he does not want to decide which ones Let
Luck choose or whatever agency runs the lives of men

STEIN
All right yes Thank you Doll

Doll crawls away biting the inside of his lip so hard that it
brings tears to his eyes Fife watches him bang his head
violently against a rock his whole body writhing like a
snakes Why does he do things like this to himself Why
cant he keep his mouth shut

STEIN
All right Keck When theyre all
there space them out Advance by
rushes You might as well go Were
counting on you

KECK
Listen Cap’n Theres somethin’ I
wanted to tell you That guy Bell
is a good man Pretty steady He
helped me get going and get the
platoon out of that hole we were in
after that charge I just wanted to
tell you

STEIN
Okay Ill remember Take care of
yourself Keck I need you

KECK
Ill take care of myself as good as
anybody can around here

LT BAND
Give them hell Sergeant Give them
hell

The two attacking squads soon separate themselves from the
other half of the platoon Most of them in their bodily
attitudes and in their faces resemble sheep about to be led
to the slaughter pens in Chicago They wait Keck has only to
crawl to them

KECK
Okay you guys This is it Were
goin’ down in groups of four No
point in goin’ by rushes only make
a better target stopped Run all
the way We aint got any choice
Were picked so we got to go Ill
take the first bunch myself I want
Charlie Dale with me Dale You can
organize them guys thats down
there Lets move out

He starts to crawl to the jump-off point just beyond the knot
of officers and CP men and it is here that the first case of
overt cowardice occurs in C-for-Charlie A big beautifully
muscled man named SICO an Italian draftee from Philly
suddenly sits down in his tracks and begins to hold his
stomach and groan

KECK
Get up God damn you Sico Or I1l
kick you so hard in that stomach
youll really be sick

SICO
I cant Sergeant I would if I
could You know I would Im sick

KECK
Sick my foot

WELSH
Hold it Keck What is it Sico

SICO
I dont know Sergeant Its my
stomach Pains Cramps I cant
straighten up Im sick

As if to prove it he suddenly vomits He does not even try to
bend over and the vomit burps up out of him and runs down
over his fatigue shirt onto his hands which hold his belly
He looks at Welsh hopefully out of the dark tortured holes
of his eyes but appears ready to do it again if necessary

WELSH
Leave him
(to Sico)
Come on The medics will take care
of you Sico

SICO
Thank you Sergeant

Keck seems to want to protest Witt studies the scene
Welshs indulgence is curious to him

WELSH
Dont argue with me

Sico continues to sit and watch the others pass He groans
audibly from time to time and now and then he gags but
apparently does not feel it necessary to vomit more His face
looks haunted and his eyes tormented

Kecks men begin to run the gauntlet Each squad sergeant -
first Milly Becker then McCron -- supervises the jump-off of
his men in groups of four All of them make it down safely
except two Of these one a Mississippi farmer named Catt
is killed outright The other Pvt Alfredo Tella hit
running falls bounces hard and moans like a boy who has
taken a spill from his bicycle

Unfortunately the Japanese heavy mortars still firmly
seated on the heights of Hill 210 have seen the forward
movement of American troops too Shells begin EXPLODING
their fountains of terror dirt and fragments as the Japanese
gunners finger the area

EXT GRASSY SLOPE (KECK’S ATTACK) - DAY

Keck spreads his men out in a line and then gives the order
to crawl The grass is about chest-high here and has a
matted tangled underhayer of old stems It chokes them with
dust ties up their arms and feet makes it impossible to
see They crawl for what seems an eternity expecting the
Japanese to open up at any moment It requires tremendous
exertion Most of them have long since used up all of their
water Halfway up the slope Keck orders them to stop

For a moment he lies gathering his will power and thinks
about their faces Then taking a deep breath he stands up
straight in the grass

KECK
Up Up Go

They rise in a line and begin to scamper uphill FIRING as
they go Almost immediately the MGs begin to HAMMER and at
once men begin to fall The fury of the Japanese fire strikes
them like a wind-tormented hailstorm The Japanese have been
smart and have waited conserving their fire till they have
targets Four men of McCron’s squad go down at once On the
right a young draftee named Wynn is shot in the throat and
screams Oh my God in a voice of terror and disbelief as
a geyser of blood spurts from his neck Next to him another
soldier is caught in the face perhaps from the same burst
He goes down without a sound looking as if hes been hit in
the face with a tomato All this is apparently too much for
McCron who has clucked over and mothered this squad for
months and he simply drops his rifle and sits down crying

Dale on the left sees the first emplacement the first live
one any of them has ever actually seen It is a one-gun job
a simple hole dug in the ground and covered over with sticks
and kunai grass From the dark opening he can see the muzzle
SPITTING FIRE at him So far Dale has not fired a shot What
is the point when there are no targets But now seeing the
emplacement he carefully releases his safety and FIRES a
long burst with his Thompson gun straight into the hole
twenty yards away Before he can release the trigger the gun
jams solidly But his burst is enough to stop the machine
gun at least momentarily and Dale runs toward it pulling a
grenade from his shirt From ten yards away he throws the
grenade like a baseball wrenching hell out of his shoulder
The grenade disappears through the hole then BLOWS UP
scattering sticks and grass and three rag dolls and upending
the machine gun Dale turns back to his squad licking his
lips and grinning with beady pride

MGs still hammer at them from seemingly every quarter of the
globe Men are still going down They still have not located
any main strongpoints Directly in front of them thirty yards
away there is a winding gully and four-foot cut which
extends clear across their front

Instinctively everyone begins to run for that They dive in
behind its protection pell-mell sobbing with exhaustion The
exertion and the heat have been too much Several men vomit
One man gurgles once senselessly then -- his eyes rolling
back in his head -- faints from heat prostration They lie
against the ledge in the midday sun and smell the hot summer-
smelling dust Insects HUM around them The fire has stopped

DOLL
Well what’re we gonna do now

KECK
Were gonna stay right here Maybe
they1l get some reinforcements up
to us

DOLL
Ha To do what

KECK
To capture these goddamn fucking
positions around here What you

think

DOLL
You mean you really want to go on
with it

KECK

I dont know No Not no uphill
charge But they get us some
reinforcements we can scout around
and maybe locate where all these
goddamn fucking MGs are Anyway
its better than going back down
through that You want to go back
down

Nobody answers this and Keck does not feel it necessary to
elaborate Witt studies the ants crawling on the ground

KECK
McCron’s gone Bell Im appointing
you acting sergeant in his place

BECKER
What if the Japs come down here in
force and throw us off of here

KECK
I dont think they will But we
better have a sentry Doll

WITT
Somethin’s comin’

DOLL
They’re comin’ Somebody’s comin’

As one man the line behind the cut sweeps up and forward
rifles ready

Forty yards away seven pot-headed bandy-legged starved-
looking Japanese men are running down-at them across an
ungrassed area carrying hand grenades in their right hands
and bayoneted rifles in their left The massed rifle FIRE
from the ledge disposes of them quickly Only one of them is
able even to throw and his grenade a dud lands short When
the fire ceases only two bodies continue to move Aiming
deliberately in the sudden quiet Witt the Kentuckian puts a
killing round into each one of them

WITT
You never can tell about them boys
Even when they’re hit

DOLL
Why’d they do it If they wanted to
throw us out of here why didnt
they come in force Why just seven
It dont figure

DALE
Maybe they were doing it on their
own Without orders

They await a second larger attack but only four more
Japanese appear Witt who is the best marksman in the
regiment quickly SHOOTS three down Doll and Dale watch in
awe Keck reaches in his hip pocket to pull out a grenade
and-in the excitement he gets it by the pin He and Bell
exchange a look of dizzying near-fainting terror then he
leaps back from the line and sits back against a little dirt
hammock to protect the others The grenade goes off with a
sickening THUD They see there is nothing they can do for
him His entire right buttock and much of his lower back have
been blown away

KECK
What a fucking recruit trick to
pull

BECKER
He jumped away -- so we wouldnt
get hit

Bell and Doll sit with him while the others go back to the
line They wipe the mud off his face and try to reassure him

DOLL
Well take care of you Keck I
swear to God we will Just take it
easy

KECK
You guys write my old lady will
you Dont forget I want her to
know I died like a man

DOLL
Sure sure But nobodys gonna haf
to write your old lady Youll come
out of this We got stretcher-
bearers with us remember
Battalion Aid Stations movin up
all the time Theyll have you back
to the docs in no time

KECK
Bullshit Dont bullshit me Im
cold

BELL

There there Just take it easy

KECK
You guys dont forget to write my
old lady I died like a man

He sighs first sign of the approaching breathlessness of
massive hemorrhage

KECK
I grabbed it by the pin This
fuckin’ mud on my face

Bell wets his handkerchief and cleans Kecks face with it
This seems to make him feel better Becker turns from the cut
to signal the company to send reinforcements

KECK
Just dont forget to write my old
lady I died like a man

DOLL
Just take it easy Dont talk like
that Youll make it out of this

KECK
Horseshit Im bleedin’ to death
Aint I

He looks at Witt who does not answer but watches him with
sympathy

KECK
See Maybe its just as good Im
all messed upon the crock What if
I couldnt fuck no more Just dont
forget to write my old lady I died
manly

DOLL
Sure sure Ill write her Just
take it easy

Witt comes up Doll and Bell drift away Witt is calm and
cheerful in the presence of death he does not look away He
feels a bond with the dying man The others are solemn
embarrassed

KECK
Aid Station’s never gonna get up
here The medics either

WITT
Youre gonna be all right Even if
you die You didnt let your
brother down Those flies
bothering you

He whisks the flies away from Kecks face and waits His eyes
express a deep understanding and tenderness

WITT
Well remember what you done We
wont forget it It wont be
wasted

Keck looks at him uncomprehendingly The others return The
breathlessness has hit him they know it wont be long

KECK
Im cold Freezin’

When he stops breathing the men stand up

BELL
You going to write his wife

DOLL
Fuck no I dont know his old lady
Thats the Company Commanders job
not mine You out of your mind I
aint no good at writin’ letters

BELL
You told him you would

DOLL

I say anything when theyre like

that
BELL

Somebody ought to do it
DOLL

Then you write her
BELL

I didnt tell him I would
WITT

(to Doll)

You make me sick

Squaring his shoulders he stares at Doll ready to fight him
then and there in the midst of combat Doll does not want a
fight Witt turns away in disgust Charlie Dale comes over

DALE
All over
DOLL
Yeah
THIRD FOLD TO CUT (WITH BINOCULAR MATTE) - DAY

Stein through his binoculars sees the men clustered around
the figure on the ground two hundred yards away Keck Then
he sees that Sgt Becker is looking at him -or anyway toward
him -- and making the Old Army hand-and-arm signal for
Converge on me He wants reinforcements Exertion nervous
exhaustion and fear are wearing Stein down

STEIN
He wants help That whole ridge
is a giant honeycomb of MG
emplacements A regular fortress
The attacks bogged down They
arent enough men Itd take a full

company
(to Band)

Twelve men down I counted every

one of them My men Now he

wants us to send more after them

Suddenly Stein hears from near the foot of the ridge the
first thin piping YELLS They sound insane

What they lack in volume they more than make up in their
penetrating qualities They come in a series each lasting
five full seconds Then there is silence

STEIN
Whats that

BAND
My God

Band looks back at him with squinted dilated eyes From the
high grass out beyond them high and shrill the series of
yells comes again They are not screams Stein is able to
pick him out easily with the glasses which brings him up
very close too close for comfort Pvt Tella -- he has fallen
at the bottom of the slope Now he is trying to crawl back
He has been hit squarely in the groin with a burst of heavy
MG fire which has torn his whole belly open Lying on his
back his head uphill both hands pressed to his belly to
hold his intestines in he is inching his way toward them

STEIN
Tella Medic

LT BAND
What are we gonna do

From below the insane series of YELLS comes again identical
unchanging Stein and Band arent the only ones to hear them
The entire remainder of the 2nd Platoon lying along the crest
of the swell have heard him So has the Medic who is now
running bent over along the slope to Stein Fife pricks his
ears The mortar shells are still falling every minute or
two Sometimes you can hear their fluttery SHU-ING sound for
two seconds before they hit and Fife is completely
terrorized by them

MEDIC
Theres nothing anybody can do
that’ll help him Hell be dead
before they can ever get him back
to a surgeon Hes got dirt all
over his bowels Even sulfa wont
fix that In these jungles

STEIN
How long

MEDIC
Two hours Four maybe Maybe only
one Maybe less

STEIN
God damn it man We cant any of
us stand it that long Not counting
him And I cant ask you to go down
there

The Medic studies the terrain He blinks several times

MEDIC
Maybe its worth a try

STEIN
You said yourself nobody could do
anything to help him

MEDIC
At least I could get a syrette of
morphine into him

STEIN
Would one be enough I mean you
know would it keep him quiet

MEDIC
Not for long But I could give him
two I could leave him three or
four for himself

STEIN
Maybe he wouldnt take them Hes
delirious Couldnt you just sort
of give them all to him at once

MEDIC
That would kill him sir I
couldnt do that I really
couldnt

STEIN
Okay -- well you want to try it

From below the set unchanging series of YELLS rises up to
them precise inflexible a little quavery this time

STEIN
I hope he doesnt begin to cry God
damn it My company wont have any
fighting spirit left at all if we
dont do something about him

MEDIC
Ill go sir After all its my
job After all its worth a try
isnt it sir To stop the yells

STEIN
God I dont know

MEDIC
Im volunteering Ive been down
there before They wont hit me

sir

STEIN
You were on the left Its not as
bad there

MEDIC

Im volunteering
Agonized Stein waits several seconds before he speaks

STEIN
When do you want to go

MEDIC
Any time Right now

STEIN
No wait At least I can give you
some covering fire

MEDIC
Id rather go now sir And get it
over with

They have been lying side by side their helmets almost
touching as they talk and now Stein turns to look at the
boy He cannot help wondering whether he has talked this boy
into volunteering

STEIN
Okay Go ahead

The Medic nods looking straight ahead this time then
springs up into a crouch and is gone over the crest of the
swell

It is all over almost before it gets started Running like
some fleeting forest animal his medics web equipment
flopping he reaches the damaged Tella swings round to face
him up the hill then drops to his knees his hands already
groping at the pouch which holds his syrettes

Before he can get the cap off the needle one single MG OPENS
UP from the ridge stitching across the area Stein and the
remnants of 2nd Platoon watch him jerk straight up eyes and
mouth wide face slack not so much with disbelief or mental
shock as with sheer simple physiological surprise

Stein waits Seconds ago he was alive and Stein was talking
to him now he is dead Just like that But Steins attention
is pulled away before he can think more pulled away by two
things One is Tella who now begins to scream in a high
babbling falsetto of hysteria totally different from his
former yells Obviously he has been hit again and while one
bloodstained hand tries to hold in his intestines the other
gropes at the new wound in his chest

DISTANT JAPANESE (0S)
Cly Yank cly Yerl Yank yerl

The next thing that catches Steins attention is a figure
emerging from the grass fifty yards ahead and plodding
steadily toward them Stein sees that it is his Sgt McCron
that he is wringing his hands and weeping On his face two
great white streaks of clean skin run from eye to chin
accentuating the eyes as if he were wearing the haunting
makeup of a tragic actor in some Greek drama

And on he comes while behind him Japanese MGs and small arms
OPEN UP all across the ridge making dirt puffs all around
him Nothing touches him At last he sits down beside his
Captain

MCCRON
Dead All dead Cap’n Every one
Im the only one All twelve Young
men I looked after them Taught
them everything I knew It didnt
mean a thing Dead What more can
you do

LT BAND
They cant all be dead McCron

MCCRON
(in a rage)
I tried to help them All gone
They ‘re all gone Wynn Gordon
Darl Gwenne Vincente Mack

STEIN
Medic Take him back Stay with
him When you get back there tell
them we need another medic now At
least one

SECOND MEDIC
Yes sir Come on Mac Thats it
Come on boy Itll be all right
Itll be all right

MCCRON
Theyre all dead How can it be all
right Why Why Why

He allows himself to be led off by the arm Stein sighs and
turns his attention back to Tella The Italian is still
screaming his piercing wailing scream and does not seem to
show any indication that he is ever going to run down If it
keeps on it is going to unnerve them all Stein does not
know what to do He cannot send another man out there A hot
unbelieving outraged fury seizes him And just then a large
green object of nature on his right rises up and bounds over
the crest of the swell growling obscenities Before Stein
can even yell the one word Welsh the First Sergeant is
careering across the field at full gallop toward the ridge

WELSH AND TELLA (TRACK WITH WELSH)

Welsh sees everything before him with a furious clarity the
rocky thin-grassed field running off to the foot of the
ridge mortar-and bullet-pocked the hot bright sunshine and
deep cerulean sky the incredibly white clouds above the
towering high-up horseshoe of Hill 210 the yellow serenity
of the ridge before him

WELSH
Fuck you Fuck you

He charges on happily zigzagging professionally But when
he skids to a stop on his belly beside the mutilated Italian
boy he realizes he has made no plans about what to do when
he arrives here

WELSH
How goes it kid

Tella rolls his eyes around like a maddened horse until he
can see who it is He does not stop his screaming

WELSH
You got to be quiet I came to help
you Tella

Finally the scream stops of itself from lack of breath and
Tella breathes causing more blood to run from the hole in
his chest When he speaks it is only a few decibels lower
than the scream

TELLA
Fuck you Im dying Im dying
Sarge Look at me Get away from
me Im dying

WELSH
Okay but goddamn it do it with
less noise

TEL LA
How you going to help me

WELSH
Take you back

TELLA
You cant take me back You want to
help me shoot me

WELSH
(yelling in the noise)
Youre off your rocker You know I
cant do that

TELLA
Sure you can You got your rifle
there Point it at me You want to
help me shoot me and get it over
with I cant stand it Im scared

WELSH
Does it hurt much

TELLA
Sure it hurts you dumb son of a
bitch You can’t take me back

WELSH
Well see You stick with old
Welsh Trust old Welsh Did I ever
give you a bum steer

He is aware now -- he knows -- that he wont be able to stay
much longer Already he is flinching and jerking
uncontrollably under the fire Crouching he runs around to
Tellas head and gets him under the armpits and heaves

TELLA
Aaa-eeeee Youre killing me
Youre pulling me apart Put me
down goddamn you Put me down

Welsh drops him quickly by simple reflex Too quickly

TELLA
You son of a bitch You son of a
bitch Leave me alone Leave me
alone Dont touch me Why are you
touching me

WELSH
(yelling)
Stop that yelling It aint
dignified All right well do it
this way then

Slipping one arm under the Italians knees and the other
under his shoulders he lifts

TELLA
Aaa-eeeee Put me down Put me
down Youre breaking me in two
Put me down Youll kill me You
son of a bitch You fucker You
bastard I told you to leave me
alone I never ast you to come down
here Go away Leave me alone You
shiteater Stay away from me

Turning his head away and closing his eyes he begins his
desperate wailing piercing scream again Five yards above
them on the slope a line of machine gun BULLETS slowly
stitches itself across from left to right With sudden
desperate inspiration Welsh leaps across the prostrate Tella
and begins rummaging in the dead Medics belt pouches

WELSH
Here Tella Take these Tella

Tella stops screaming and opens his eyes Welsh tosses him
two morphine syrettes he has found and begins to attack
another pouch

TELLA
More More Gimme more More

Welsh tosses him a double handful he has found in the other
pouch and then turns to run But something stops him
Crouched like a sprinter at the gun he turns his head and
looks at Tella one more time Tella already unscrewing the
cap from one of the syrettes is looking at him feelingly
his eyes wide and white

TELLA
Goodbye Goodbye Welsh

WELSH
Goodbye kid

It is all he can think of to say For that matter it is all
he has time to say because he is already off and running
Bullets WHIR by his head He runs and runs and then he falls
headlong over the little crest and just lies there half-dead
from exhaustion

STEIN
Sergeant I saw the whole thing
through the glasses I want you to
know Im mentioning you in Orders
tomorrow Im recommending you for
the Silver Star I can only say --

WELSH
Captain if you say one word to
thank me I will punch you square
in the nose Right here If you
ever so much as mention me in your
fucking orders I will resign my
rating two minutes after and leave
you to run this pore busted-up
outfit by yourself If I go to
jail So fucking help me

He shuts his eyes and rolls over away from Bugger who says
nothing

WELSH
Property Property

Witt has perceived Welshs selfless aid to the dying man
They glance at one another Stein slowly crawls back to Fife
and the soundpower phone His arm is trembling as he takes
the receiver How long can he go on How much longer can he
watch his men being killed in agony like this His CP force
and the remnants of 2nd and 3rd Platoons watch him with white
eyes as though looking to him and hoping he can in some way
get them out of this mess so that they might go on living

COL TALL (VO)
Why arent you following up your
attack and exploiting it Whats
the matter with you Stein Those
men should be reinforced
immediately What are they doing I
can see them through my glasses
Theyre just lying behind that
ledge They should be up and out
cleaning out those machine guns
Over
STEIN
I dont think you understand whats
going on down here sir Were
taking a lot of fire Weve had
heavy casualties I was planning to
reinforce them right away
something bad happened We had a
man -- gut shot out on the slope --
he caused quite a bit of upset
Thats taken care of now I’m
planning to reinforce now Over

COL TALL (VO)
Who was that man who ran out on the
slope Was that what he was doing
Admiral Barr saw him through the
glasses the Admiral couldnt tell
for sure but thought he had gone
out to help someone Was that it
The Admiral wants to recommend that
man for something Over

STEIN

There were two men who went out
sir One was our senior medic He
was killed The other -- was one of
the privates I dont know which
one yet Ill find out Over

(releasing the button)
And fuck you And the Admiral

COL TALL (VO)
Fine Fine fine Now what about
those reinforcements Over

STEIN
I have two squads to lst Platoon I
can send up I lost Keck

Colonel One of my best men
Over

COL TALL (VO)
What the hell do you mean two
squads When I say reinforcements
I mean it Throw every man you have
in there and do it now Commit the
reserve platoon and all Everybody
lst Platoon too I see them lying
on their fat asses down there doing
nothing Move them by the flank in
to the ridge Get a man to them
right now with orders to attack

(MORE )

Have the 28IR1 adn qnietssd the
center Go straight up the hill
Envelop them Do I have to give you
a lesson in infantry tactics while
your men are getting their asses
shot off Stein Over

STEIN

(swallowing his wrath)
I dont think you fully understand
whats going on down here Colonel
I dont think my company alone can
take that position Theyre too
well dug in They have too much
firepower Colonel theres a
bunker up there we cant see it
its chewing my men to pieces I
formally request sir to be given
permission to make a patrol
reconnaissance around to the right
of Hill 210 through the jungle A
flanking move It might save lives
I believe the entire position can
be outflanked by a maneuver there
in force

COL TALL (VO)
No I tell you no I want a double
envelopment I order you Stein to
attack attack now with every man
at your disposal Now attack
Stein Thats a direct order Over

His heart suddenly up in his throat Stein hears himself
answer with a sort of numb disbelief

STEIN
Sir I must tell you that I refuse
to obey your order I again request
permission to make a patrol
reconnaissance in force around to
the right The time sir is
thirteen twenty-one hours twenty-
five seconds I have two witnesses
here listening to what Ive said I
request sir that you inform
witnesses there Over

The fact is that by now there are many more witnesses at
least half of 2nd Platoon is listening with its ears pricked

COL TALL (VO)
Stein Dont pull that guardhouse
lawyer shit with me Stein
(MORE)

I know you Céda Ydddenomtd dpwyer
Now shut up and do like I tell you
I didnt hear what you just said I
repeat my order Over

STEIN
Colonel I refuse to take my men up
there in a frontal attack Its
suicide Ive lived with these men
two-and-a-half years I wont order
them all to their deaths Thats
final Over

Someone is blubbering now not far away along the crest and
Stein tries to see who it is and cant Tall is stupid
ambitious desperate to succeed before his superiors and
fearful the battalion will be pulled back off the line before
he can Otherwise he could never have given such an order
Stein seems to read approval in his mens eyes Talls voice
is sharp as a razor

COL TALL (VO)
This is a very important decision
youre making Stein If you feel
that strongly maybe you have
reason Im coming down Im not
rescinding my® order to you but if
I find there are extenuating
circumstances when I get down
there Ill take that into account
I want you to hold on until I get
there If possible get those men
on the ridge out and moving Ill
be there in ten minutes Out

Stein listens unbelieving mentally stunned Moving up he
arrives at the wounded man who proves to be Pfc Bead from
Iowa Fifes assistant clerk Bead is dying

BEAD
Im dying Captain Im dying Me
Me Im dying Im so scared
He closes his eyes for a moment and swallows Fife comes up
with the telephone wide-eyed

BEAD
I was just laying there It hit me
right in the side Like somebody
punched me Didnt hurt much
Doesnt hurt much now Oh Captain

STEIN
Just take it easy son Just take
it easy

BEAD

Wheres Fife

STEIN
Hes right here son Right here
Fife

FIFE
Im here

BEAD

Im dying Fife

FIFE
I know Just take it easy Just
take it easy Eddie

BEAD
Will you write my folks
(as Fife nods)
Tell them it didnt hurt me much
Tell them the truth

FIFE
Ill tell them

BEAD
Hold my hand Fife Im scared

For a moment a second Fife hesitates Then realizing with
horror that Bead is slipping away he grips his hand
Crawling closer he slides his other arm under his shoulders
cradling him

He has begun to cry more because he suddenly realizes that
he is the only man in the whole company whom Bead can call a
friend than because Bead is dying Ah what a poor friend
hes been

FIFE
Ive got it

BEAD
Squeeze Squeeze

FIFE
Im squeezing

He leans forward and presses Beads hand against his cheek
Bead gives a little cry

BEAD
Oh Fife Oh Captain

His eyes do not go shut but they cease to see After a moment
Fife puts him down and crawls away by himself weeping in
terror weeping in fear weeping in sadness hating himself

STEIN
Lie down somewhere for a little
bit son Ill keep the phone for a
few minutes myself There wont be
any calls coming in for a while

EXT CUT TOWARDS LEDGE —- DAY

Back at the cut Beckers men are growing nervous Where are
the reinforcements Doll glances nervously at Witt

BECKER
Were just going to get killed if
we stay here Theyre not going to
just let us set Bell take six
men go around to the right of the
ledge see whats up there Well
stay here and cover you best we
can

Bell sets off with his men Everything works from the
beginning Finding the cut totally unguarded they are able
to crawl into the midst of the Japanese position and drop
grenades down into the rear doors of two covered camouflaged
emplacements they spot down below them two further
emplacements on the uphill side are more difficult but
bypassing them and crawling up alongside they are able to
pitch grenades into the apertures

Father up Bell discovers the Japanese strongpoint
beautifully dug in and with apertures in three directions He
does not see it all at first When the lead man climbs out
he is RIDDLED fatally by three machine guns Both Witt and
Doll are in Bells party but neither of them happens to be
the lead man This distinction is reserved for a man named
Catch Lemuel C Catch an old-time regular He dies
immediately and without a sound They pull his body down and
retreat with it while all hell breaks loose FIRING just
above their heads but not before Acting Sergeant Bell gets a
good look at the strongpoint so he can describe it

BELL
Wait here

Halting his men a few yards back from where Catch died
leaving his rifle and holding a grenade in one hand Bell
climbs up pokes up his head The Japanese firing has stopped
now All he can see is the unending grass rising slowly
along a hillock which sticks up out of the ridge He waits
wondering if he will die then pulling the pin heaves the
grenade with all his strength and ducks down The grenade
falls and EXPLODES just in front of the hillock and in the
cyclone of MG FIRE which follows Bell is able to count five
guns in five spitting apertures which he could not see
before He notes it all carefully and when the firing ceases
he crawls back down to his men obscurely satisfied

BELL
Theres five -- five guns

Whatever it was that made him do it and he still doesnt
know it makes every man in his little group look at him
admiringly Dale Doll Witt especially Witt Motioning
them on he leads them back down until the companys main
position at the third swell comes into view To their
surprise they have not seen or heard a single Japanese
anywhere near the ledge

WITT
Dont make sense For them to leave
this place unguarded

EXT CUT TOWARDS LEDGE —- DAY

The mortar ROUNDS continue to drop at random points along the
swell with strict regularity It is amazing how few men they
actually wound or kill Fife hears the soft SHU-U-U of the
mortar shell for perhaps half a second There is not even
time to connect it with himself before there is a huge
sunburst roaring of an EXPLOSION almost on top of him

He has a vague impression of someone screaming but does not
know it is himself Fifes body comes to rest in the lap of a
HQs man who happens to be sitting up

FIFE
Am I hit Am I hit

TRAIN
Y-yes you are In the head

FIFE
Bad Is it bad

TRAIN
I c-cant tell Y-youre bleeding
from your head

FIFE
Am I

Fife looks at his hands and finds them completely covered
with a glistening red Gingerly he probes at his skull and
finds nothing

TRAIN
I-its in the b-back
(fearfully)
How do you f-feel

FIFE
I dont know It dont hurt Except
when I touch it

TRAIN
C-can you w-walk

FIFE
I-I dont know

Then suddenly Fife realizes that he is free He does not
have to stay here any more He is released He can simply get
up and walk away -- provided he is able -- with honor
without anyone being able to say he is a coward or court-
martialing him

FIFE
I think I better go back Dont
you Well -- Good luck Train
TRAIN

Th-thanks

Fife stands up His knees are shaky but the prospect of
getting out of here gives him a strength he might not
otherwise have At first slowly then more swiftly he begins
to walk rearward Just before he breasts the top of the hill
he meets Colonel Tall and a party of his aides

COL TALL
Hold on son Dont let it get you
down Youll be back

Beyond the hill he passes a barefoot Melanesian in a
lavalava who is leading an American soldier with a bandage
over his eyes back to the rear

EXT THIRD FOLD - CP

Stein watches Bells party through his glasses astonished
They did it all on their own

WELSH
Theres less fire coming from the
hill sir

STEIN
Ive noticed that too

WELSH
Theyve knocked out some of those
machine guns In fact theyve
cleaned out all the Japanese below
the ledge

LT BAND
Sir I think the medics can go out
pick up the wounded now

STEIN
Send 1st Platoon forward Well
follow them

Stein is just turning to lead the CP up toward the ledge to
join Becker and Bell and to consolidate their newly won
position when he looks up to see Col Tall walking leisurely
toward him carrying beneath his arm the unadorned little
bamboo baton that is his trademark and romantic whim

Bells raid has cleaned out the Japanese below the ledge and
established a real line It has utterly changed the
situation and it is one of those horrible ironies which seem
to dog the steps of certain men named Stein-that just at this
moment Col Tall should walk onto the field

COL TALL
What are you doing lying down there
where you cant see anything

STEIN
Observing sir I just sent lst
Platoon forward to the ridge

Tall nods The rest of his party which includes a young
captain named GAFF his battalion exec has decided that it
might be just as well to be lying flat on the ground

COL TALL
I saw them leaving as we were
coming along How many of them were
hit this time

STEIN
None sir

COL TALL
None Not one

A mortar round mushrooms EXPLODING dirt without hurting
anybody somewhere along the rear and Tall coming forward
to where Stein lies permits himself to squat on his
haunches

COL TALL
That doesnt sound much like the
situation you described to me over
the soundpower

STEIN
Its not sir The situations
changed In just the last five

minutes

COL TALL
To what do you attribute the
change

STEIN

Sergeant Becker sir When I last
looked half of his men had
disappeared I think he sent them
off to try and knock out some of
the MGs They seem to have
succeeded

From somewhere far off a machine gun begins to RATTLE and a
long line of bullets strikes up dirt twenty-five yards beyond
them Tall does not change his position or alter his voice

COL TALL
Then you got my message to him

STEIN
No sir Becker sent the men off on
his own They went off on their
own

COL TALL
I see
94

The long line of MG BULLETS comes sweeping back from Steins
left this time only fifteen yards away Tall does not move
but merely squints his blue eyes off at the grassy ridge in
silence

STEIN
Theyve seen you sir

COL TALL
Stein were going over there all
of us and were taking everybody
with us Do you have any more
formal complaints or demurrers

STEIN
No sir Not now

COL TALL
Now well do things my way Well
take everybody over to the ledge
We may take that ridge before
nightfall

STEIN
I think that ridge is quite a way
from being reduced sir

Tall ignores this remark and stands up to his full height
The conference is over Tall gives the ridge one contemptuous
amused look and starts walking out toward it still talking
to Stein Slowly very slowly Stein stands up to his full
height also then follows Tall out into the field where ten
minutes before they would have met a certain death

Around them as if sensing something or other is in the wind
the men begin to stir Whatever else Stein can find to say
about him he nevertheless has to admit that with Talls
arrival on the battlefield a change for the better has come
over everything and everybody Tall has brought with him some
quality that has not been here before and it shows in the
faces of the men Standing up in front of the prone HQ
Platoon his little baton in his right hand tapping it
lightly against his shoulder as he frowns in concentration
he orders them forward and shows them how he wants them to
advance He does not exhort them His attitude says quite
plainly that they deserve better than that Gathering heart
the men rush forward in groups

EXT CUT

Becker and Bell Witt Dale and Doll wait at the ledge As
the others scramble up to join them there are a few weak
cheers

COL TALL
That strongpoint is the key to the
ridge Se -- uh -- Sergeant Bell
here is quite right From their
knob there our little brown
brothers can cover the whole of the
ground in front of our position for
a thousand yards Why theyve left
it unguarded I have no idea We
must exploit it before they see
their error I know everyones
pretty exhausted and that weve had
our troubles getting water up here
but if we can reduce that big
bunker I see no reason why we
cant take the whole ridge before
nightfall Im asking for
volunteers to go back up there and
knock it out

Stein hearing for the first time this news about a further
attack is so horrified he can hardly believe his ears
Surely Tall must know how worn out they all are

BELL
Sir Ill be glad to go back again
and lead the way for a party

Immediately off to Bells right another voice pipes up Hunch-
shouldered crack-faced Acting Sergeant Dale is making his

bid for future fame future sinecures future security from
army kitchens

DALE
Ill go Colonel sir What about
you Doll

Doll nods his agreement without looking at Dale and Private
Witt comes forward at the same time Both sit down much
closer to Bell than to Dale who still squats by himself
Bell winks at Witt who grins and winks back

The rather elderly Calvinistic-looking 2nd lieutenant from
3rd Platoon presents himself His name is GORE Then Talls
own exec young Captain Gaff puts in his two cents and
offers his services

GAFF
Id like to lead the party
Colonel

COL TALL

(gazing at him fondly)

All right John Go ahead Youll
be in command Thats enough Seven
is plenty In the terrain youll be
working more men would only hinder
you I think I know more of you
would like to go Youll have to
wait for another opportunity

Stein hearing this peers at his commander closely and is
amazed to see that Tall is in deadly earnest and not joking
at all

COL TALL
Good man my young exec Youll
probably find the bunker guarded by
smaller MG posts around it I think
it is better to ignore these and go
for the strongpoint itself if you
possibly can The little posts will
fall if the big one is taken
Thats all gentlemen Noncoms
return to your positions I want
the officers to remain Synchronize
watches with me John

A mortar round EXPLODES nearby At first it appears no one is
hurt but then Storm is seen shaking his hand as though hed
touched a hot stove A single fragment not much bigger than
a pinhead has entered the back of his hand Storm grins

STORM
I been wounded I been wounded

WELSH
(with a sneer)
Okay Youll get a Purple Heart

STORM
You fucking A And dont you forget
to put me in S’like a wasp sting
Captain when can I go to the rear
I mean you know I been wounded

He raises his hand When he flexes it it makes a GRATING
sound Nobody says anything Storm continues to look
delighted

STEIN
You want to go right now

STORM
Sure

He looks at his hand again to see whether it has changed
There is no blood coming from the little blue-rimmed hole and
really it doesnt hurt very much but every time he flexes it
they can all hear it grate Stein nods Storm may leave

STORM
Might be a delicate operation to
get that fucking thing out of
there

EXT LEDGE —- DAY

Meanwhile Capt Gaffs little assault party crawls off to
the right along the ledge and disappears around the corner of
the hillside Bell at the head of the seven men keeps
thinking that he had only volunteered to lead a party back
Irritably he glances back to motion the others to come on
When he reaches the point where he crawled out above the
ledge he stops Sending Witt ahead he points the place out
to Gaff

Witt crawls out to take the point Standing on his knees out
away from the ledge he holds his rifle ready with the safety
off He hasnt shot squirrel all his life for nothing he
hasnt made High Expert on the range for the past six years
for nothing either

GAFF

Any of you guys know how to operate
this thing

(the walkie-talkie Bell

nods )
Okay you stay below the ledge
Ill call down the data to you from
up above Once the 81s have
plastered that rock as much as they
can well crawl out along that low
place until we make a line then
crawl up as close as we can through
the grass then throw our grenades
Okay Okay

Gaff crawls out into the low place before the first shells
arrive They can hear their soft SHU-SHU-SHU coming almost
straight down before they hit then the hillside EXPLODES
into smoke and flame and noise

Only fifty yards from the bunker they are showered with a
rain of dirt chips of rock and small pieces of hot metal
They cling to the ledge with their faces pressed against the
sharp rock cursing with hatred the goddamned fucking
mortarmen because they might drop a short round though they
dont Gaff yells down changes of range and Bell relays them
by walkie-talkie

GAFF
Okay Tell them to stop I think
thats enough Whatever damage they
can do theyve done it by now

Suddenly the mortars stop falling in a silence that is
almost as devastating as the noise has been

GAFF
Okay lets go

If they are under any hopeful illusion that the mortar
barrage has smashed and flattened every Japanese in the
strongpoint they are straightened out on this point right
away As the elderly morose 2nd lieutenant Gore climbs out
first he foolishly stands straight up exposing himself to
the waist whereupon a Japanese machine gunner immediately
SHOOTS him three times trough the chest Gingerly they pull
him back down behind the ledge

DALE
Whadda we do now We cant take him
with us

WITT

Well have to leave him

THORNE
You cant leave him here

DALE
Okay Hes from your platoon You
stay with him

THORNE
I didnt volunteer for this thing
just to sit with him

LT GORE
(in a faint voice)
I should have been a chaplain I
could have you know Im an
ordained minister I never should
have fooled around with the
Infantry My wife told me

BELL
We can leave him and pick him up on
the way back If hes still alive

LT GORE
You boys want to pray with me

DALE
We cant sir We got to get going
The Captains waitin’ on us

LT GORE
(without opening his eyes)
All right Ill do it myself You
boys go ahead

Witt does what he can to make Gore comfortable As they climb
out one by one on their faces and bellies so as not to make
the same mistake Gore made the faint voice drones on Dale
goes first then Doll with Witt immediately behind him

DOLL
I wish he had of been a chaplain
Theyve seen us now They know
were here

Bell is the last to go but he stops at the ledge feeling he
ought to say something some word of encouragement

BELL
Well good luck sir

LT GORE
Thanks son Which one are you I
dont want to open my eyes if I can
help it

BELL
Im Bell sir

LT GORE
Oh yes Well if you get the
chance maybe you can say some
little prayer for me I dont want
to embarrass you It certainly
cant do no harm can it

BELL
Okay sir Goodbye

As he climbs out pressing his face and chest as hard into
the dirt as he can the faint voice goes droning feebly on

GAFF
Is he dead

DALE
Not yet

GAFF

Okay well crawl up through the
grass towards the bunker Dont
fire or throw your grenades until I
give the signal I want to get as
close to the bunker as we can
without them seeing us

They are now strung out single file one behind the other
Bell sees there is another way they could approach the
bunker one that leads up above and behind the bunker

BELL
Sir see up there After that
little open space wed be behind
that little rise and then I think
we could maybe crawl all the way
around behind them

GAFF

Yes right good But I dont think
theres that much time What do you
say Dale

(Dale nods)
That would take at least another
hour of crawling Its too near
dark What do you think

DALE
I agree with you sir

No fuckin’ officer is goin’ to get Charlie Dale to take no
responsibility for what the officer done

GAFF
Okay Lets do it

Slowly Gaff snakes his belly over the lip of the trough and
off into the grass dragging his rifle by the muzzle rather
than cradling it so as not to disturb the grass more than
absolutely necessary One by one the others follow None of
them knows what sets the Japanese off One moment they are
crawling along in utter silence each man totally alone and
separate and out of contact with the others and in the next
machine gun FIRE is whipping and slashing over and around and
all about them Whatever it was they now lie separated from
each other unable to take concerted action

Each man puts his head down and huddles to the ground
praying that he might keep on living Contact is lost and
with it all command and control

DALE
Were pinned down

It is in this static situation of potential total loss that
Pfc Don Doll comes forward as a hero Sweating lying pressed
flat in an ecstasy of panic terror fear and cowardice he
simply cannot stand it any longer Wailing over and over ina
high falsetto one word -- Mother Mother -- which
fortunately nobody can hear least of all himself he leaps
to his feet and begins to run straight at the Japanese
emplacement FIRING his rifle from his hip at the one
embrasure he can see As if startled beyond reasonable
expectation most of the Japanese fire stops suddenly At the
same moment Capt Gaff released from his own temporary
panic leaps up waving his arm and shouts for the rest to
fall back With Gaff in the lead the rest of the assault
force runs for the trough and their lives Meanwhile Doll
charges on wailing his incantation Mother Mother

When his rifle is empty he throws it at the embrasure draws
his pistol and begins FIRING it With his left hand he tears
a grenade from his belt stops firing the pistol long enough
to pull the pin with one finger and lobs the grenade over
into the camouflaged roof of the emplacement which he can
now see clearly since it is only about twenty yards away and
where the grenade EXPLODES uselessly and without effect
Then continuing to FIRE the pistol he charges on Only when
the pistol ceases to fire for want of ammunition does he come
to his senses and realize where he is

Astonished he turns and runs Luckily for Doll he does not
turn back toward the others but simply runs blindly off to
the right In this direction the curving ledge is only ten
yards away and he reaches it before the mass of the
Japanese FIRE can find him

From behind him as he runs the ten yards a dark round
FIZZLING object arches over his head and falls a few feet in
front of him Automatically Doll kicks at it with his foot as
if place-kicking a football and runs on It bounces away a
few yards and EXPLODES in a cloud of black smoke which knocks
him down But when he falls he finds that there is nothing-
under him he has fallen over the ledge His foot stinging
painfully he bounces to the foot of the ledge landing with
a bone-jarring THUD then rolls another ten yards before he
can get himself stopped

EXT LEDGE —- DAY

For a while Doll just lies in the grass breathing in groans
bruised sore the wind knocked out of him half-blinded At
the moment all he can think about is that he wants to be with
people so he can put his arms around somebody and they can
put their arms around him With this in mind he gets up and
grasping the ledge runs gas pin back along it till he comes
to the trough where he almost runs head-on into the others
all sitting against the rock and gasping breathlessly Only
one of them Thorne has been hurt and he has had his
shoulder smashed by an MG bullet Capt Gaff speaks before
Doll can apologize make excuses or explain away what he has
done Doll can hardly believe his ears

GAFF

Doll Im personally recommending
you to Colonel Tall for the
Distinguished Service Cross You
saved all our lives I never saw
such bravery Im going to write
the recommendation myself and Im
going to pursue it I promise you

DOLL
Well sir it wasnt nothin’ I was
scared

He can see Charlie Dale looking at him with a kind of hate-
filled envy from where he leans gasping against the ledge

GAFF
To remember the ledge was off there
to the right that was wonderful

DOLL
Well sir you know I was with the
first patrol

He smiles insolently at Dale Gaff is still breathing
heavily

GAFF
So were some of these others Are
you okay Youre not hurt

DOLL
(fingering his boot)
Well sir I dont know

GAFF
Whats that from

DOLL
A Jap hand grenade I kicked it
away I better look

He unlaces the boot Inside he finds the little piece of
metal which has slipped to the bottom like a pebble but in
actual truth he has not even felt it He lies laughing

DOLL
Hunh Felt like a rock in my shoe

GAFF
By God Its only a scratch but by
God Im recommending you for the
Purple Heart too You might as
well have it Youre all right --
except for that

DOLL
I lost my rifle

GAFF
Take Lieutenant Gores We better
be getting back And tell them we
couldnt take the objective Can a
couple of you drag Lieutenant Gore
(to Thorne)
You all right Think you can make

it

THORNE
Im all right But I want to thank
you

DOLL

Dont thank me

THORNE
Im out of it now Ill be going
back I hope Im crippled a little

GAFF
Come on you guys Lets move You
can talk it over later Dale you
and Witt drag Lieutenant Gore
Bell you help the Thorne I11
take the walkie-talkie Doll you
rear-guard us Them little brown
brothers as the Colonel likes to
say are liable to send some people
down here after us you know

EXT PATH DOWN LEDGE - DAY

The little party makes its way back The Japanese send no one
after them Gaff stops at the point where Bell found the
little path that might lead up above the Japanese position

GAFF
I think we can take it If we get
another chance at it tomorrow I
think we can take it I for one
am going to volunteer for the
assignment If we crawl on across
that open space and get behind the
rise up that path Bell found --
see there -- we can come around
behind them -- come down on them
from above Sergeant Bell was
right From up there we can put the
grenades to them -- easier than
hell

WITT
Ill go with you Captain

Doll says he will too and so does Dale Strangely enough
there is not one of them but who wants to go back with him --
excepting of course Thorne who cannot go

EXT CUT - BATTALION POSITION — DAY

The soldiers at C-for-Charlies forward position watch and
wait anxiously to see who will return with the assault party
if anyone returns at all Queen chews his fingernails the
tension is unbearable Suddenly they hear the electrifying
word Witt Other names follow Doll Dale Bell

Stein watches the weary men crawl licking their wounds back
into the midst of the company It is getting close to dark
They find that in their absence most of Charlie has on
Colonel Talls orders already dug in The company looks at
them with reverence though it has heard and correctly
interpreted their little assault as a failure As Witt passes
by Welsh smiles at him sardonically

WITT
You know what Im afraid of Firs’
Sarn’ That someday Ill end up
like you I hope I die before it
happens

WELSH
I feel sorry for you kid A
little

WITT

Hows that

WELSH
The Armys going to kill you

(taking Witts measure)

Take care of yourself Forget the
others Theres nothing you can do
for them Youre running into a
burning house where nobody can be
saved Why save people that arent
worth saving anyway

(when Witt does not reply)
Theres no other world Just this
one Your sacrifice wont mean
anything Nobodys does

(pointing up the hill)

Who decides when you walk out on
that slope who gets hit who
doesnt What difference can a
single man make in all this --
madness -- this evil

Witt does not answer but looks at him turns and goes away

Lt Band queries Dale about his experiences Apart from a
natural curiosity he feels Dale has been a loner in the
outfit and could benefit from some expression of friendly
interest from an officer

LT BAND
Well Dale what was it like up
there
(as bale shrugs)
Didnt you feel anything up there

DALE
Feel Yeah I guess I felt scared
Once we was there anyway

LT BAND
Well you hardly look it Sergeant

DALE
You dont really know me yet
Lootenant

LT BAND
But when those men were hit One
died You knew them

DALE
Lootenant I think we done pretty
good Got off pretty lucky As for
feeling the Service dont pay me
no extra Feeling Pay for feeling
Like they pay flyers Flight Pay
for flyin’ I figure I aint
required to feel I dont plan to
feel any more thans absolutely
necessary The minimum feeling

EXT BATTALION AID STATION - DAY

Fife walks up to the battalion aid station his heart dancing
with the wild joyful knowledge that he is wounded and can
leave Then seeing the more seriously wounded he suddenly
begins to weep he cannot stop himself

He sits with a line of grimy bleeding groaning men on a
hillside mopping the blood from his forehead There seem to
be hundreds of people running everywhere all shouting at one
another An orderly attaches a colored tag to Fifes jacket
A DOCTOR leans over and looks into Fifes eyes and then snaps
his fingers in front of them

FIRST DOCTOR
Cant tell Dont walk Wait for
the stretcher-bearers to take you
Hear me Dont walk Answer me I
said dont walk

Fife is carted away by four beat-looking STRETCHER-BEARERS

FI FE
Listen fellows I can make it all
right You guys should be carrying
somebody hit worse than me

STRETCHER-BEARER
You just take it easy mack You
been doin the fightin’ Let us
worry about the carryin

Good boys good boys He relaxes cozily He will never have
to go back there and it hasnt really been bad at all Fora
second he catches Sico’s eye but with a fine discretion he
looks away

INT OPERATING TENT —- DAY

But in the operating tent Fife finds out it isnt going to
be at all as easy as he thought He is put on a vacant table
in front of old DOC HAINES the Head Regimental Surgeon
Grizzled Doc Haines works with an unlit stub of a cigar in
his mouth grunting to himself from time to time

DOC HAINES
Wait Dont tell me Its -- Fife
isnt it C-for-Charlie Company

FIFE
Yes sir Doc

DOC HAINES
I remember you from when you went
up to Post Hospital for that
appendectomy How did that ever
turn out Everything all right now
What have we here now Head wound
hunh Can you sit up

FIFE
Sure Sure

DOC HAINES
Easy Take it easy Youve lost a
little blood there Lets have a
look-see This’ll hurt a little bit
now Youre lucky It isnt
fractured You may have I think
what we call a greenstick fracture
sort of crack not a break In any
case theres no foreign objects
inside In a week or so youll be
all ready to go again

FIFE
Then -- you dont think I1l be
evacuated Or anything like that

DOC HAINES
I wouldnt think so

FIFE
Then I can walk all right now

DOC HAINES
Do anything you like Except you
should take it easy for a day or
two

FIFE
(bitterly)
Thanks Doc

DOC HAINES
This battlell be over in a day or
two you know

FIFE
Sure As soon as this one’s over
therell be another one Right
after

From his blood-caked face he grins feeling it draw his
cheeks He knows he makes a good picture of a wounded man
anyway

DOC HAINES
I didnt make the rules son I
just try to live by them

FIFE
Its not your problem If a guy
aint hurt bad enough to ship out
you cant ship him out can you I
better go

DOC HAINES
Good luck son

Fife waves his hand without looking back

EXT OPERATING TENT - DAY

Outside the operating tent the CAPTAIN who is the Regimental
S-1 sees Fife and breaks away from a group of other staff
officers

S-1
Hey Arent you from Charlie
Company
FIFE
Yes sir Yes sir I sure am
S-1
Hows it going up there
FIFE
Terrible
(maliciously)

(MORE )

Theyre knédFE(¢aite Ghit out of
us

S-1
Hows Lt Whyte making out

FIFE
Dead

The S-1 Captain recoils a little as if he has been struck
his eyes disturbed The others in the group of gossiping
officers have turned and are listening too

s-1
How about Lt Blane

FIFE
Dead Kecks dead Groves dead
Tella Bead Catt

S-1
Well what about Captain Stein
Were good friends

FIFE
He was all right when I left Hes
probly dead too by now

He goes off Then suddenly for no reason he begins to
blubber again Falling down on his knees behind a truck he
beats his fists in the mud beside himself

At the ledge the high racketing which has hung in the air
most of the day ceased some time ago and only sporadic RIFLE
FIRE can be heard now in the distance As twilight passes
into night the officers discuss the prospects of tomorrow
and the men clean their weapons

Beneath a canopy of hard bright stars the men struggle to
get a few hours sleep Sgt Welsh walks silently quietly
through their midst The Japanese dead lie in the moonlight
their pockets turned inside out They are at peace while the
living burn and rage

INT HOSPITAL TENT - NIGHT
Later in a corner of the large three-masted circus-type
hospital tent he finds Storm sitting on a cot and staring

glumly at the blue-edged hole in the back of his hand

FIFE
Storm
STORM
How you doin kid Youre the
first guy I seen from the outfit

Storm is glad to see Fife too Right now any familiar face
is welcome in this buzzing crowded haunted place

INT HOSPITAL TENT - NIGHT
Storm spits on the ground Some time has passed

STORM

The adventure of war the
brotherhood the comradeship you
know -- they can wipe their ass on
it It might be all right for field
officers and up who get to run it
and decide what to do Everybody
else is a tool -- with their serial
number stamped on ‘em I dont like
being no tool Not especially
when it can get you killed

(after a pause)
They used to fight man to man It
was a duel You could be brave and
noble all that shit What you were
-- your personal qualities -- they
counted Now its just like two
machines grinding each other up I
feel sorry about leaving the
comp’ny and coming down here But
shit

(after a pause)
If this hand dont get me clean
away from this fucking Rock I can
go back to being a mess sergeant I
can cook hot food for ‘em and get
it to ‘em I wont carry it myself
The carriers can do that Lot of
people are going to come out of
this war alive more than get
killed -- I want to be one of them

(guiltily)
I hadnt told nobody else I want
to leave a good impression on the
boys Morale you know

Fifes sharp despair leaves him for a moment He suddenly
feels toward Storm as toward a father or older brother

STORM
Here I am trying to use my hand to
get me out of the compny But the
fact is everybodys on their own
Solo

FIFE
What do you think theyre going to
say about it

Storm stares at him with dark haunted eyes

STORM
Since you aint a doctor I guess I
can tell you the truth
(flexing his hand)
I got a hunch it aint ever gonna
get me off this Rock

Around them in the big dim tent orderlies stir and move
quietly about Here and there men groan from within their
bandages

STORM
I can move it It dont really hurt
too bad But I aint got any
strength left in it
(after a pause)
You was looking pretty bad up

there

FIFE
(bitterly)
Nothing Nothing Not a fucking
thing Not even a fracture

STORM
Its just tough luck Ill tell you
one thing Fife Whether I get

(raising his hand)

off The Rock with it or not I
dont have to go back up there to
the front with the compny and Im
not going to Im a mess sergeant
I aint even supposed to be up
there Me and my cooks1ll get the
kitchen as close as we can Ill

Im sorry
Fife nods They are silent for a moment

FIFE
Im a coward

STORM
(immediately)
So am I So is everybody who aint
a fucking goddamn fool

FIFE
Some of the guys aint Witt Doll
Bell Even Charlie Dale

STORM
(without hesitation)
Then theyre fools

Nearby a sleeping man screams in his sleep then falls silent
again

FIFE
I mean really a coward

STORM
What did you think I meant

FIFE
With you its different

STORM
No it aint

FIFE
I didnt want to be a coward I
never thought I would be Just
turns out I am I been hiding it

STORM
Well I didnt want to be one
either I guess But I am
(flexing his hand)
Thank God I dont have to go back
up there thats all

FIFE
I do

STORM
Im sorry At least youll have a
couple of days off This shootin1l
be over with by then

It is clear that Storm is sorry But his tone points out
that even while he is sorry all that really has nothing to
do with him Still Fife feels better Storm takes being a
coward so much more in his stride and it makes Fife feel
less unmanly

FIFE
All these men around here lookin’
at me like I was a hero I havent
even done my normal duty

STORM
I dont believe theres many
heroes Ones I seen was crazy Or
got killed The brave ones always
die

FIFE
Maybe I could come to work for you
in the kitchen I mean since Dale
will be making line sergeant
youll have a vacancy wont you

STORM
Yeah I guess Can you cook

FIFE
No but I can learn

STORM
If you can get the Captain to move
you to the kitchen force I1l
accept you

FIFE
Steinll never let me go Anyway I
could never ask him

STORM
Its the best I can do

FIFE
Yeah I know I know

He twists his neck from side to side and peers around the
high dim hot-aired tent A single orderly moves down the
line of wounded men sleeping now each in a cocoon of
mosquito netting

FIFE
I dont want to let them down They
never let me down Id feel like I
was hiding

He walks off He might as well get it over with If he waits
until morning he might find reasons not to

EXT HOSPITAL TENT —- NIGHT

At the door to the tent an ORDERLY rises to block Fifes
path but Fife pushes on past him

ORDERLY
Where are you going You dont have
your discharge papers Stay there
You cant do this

Storm following Fife out steals a couple of rifles and a
helmet from an unattended MP jeep

EXT CUT - DAWN

Whispers and cautionary stirrings move along the line In the
inhuman unreal unlight of false dawn the dirty-faced
remnants of C-for-Charlie sift from their holes and gather
stiffly into their squads and platoons Still looking dapper
although he is now almost as dirty as themselves Col Tall
with his little bamboo baton in his armpit and his hand
resting on his rakishly low-slung holster strides among the
men wishing them good luck When he arrives at Gaffs group
he squats down

COL TALL
Im giving you another chance at
the bunker today gentlemen I
would have liked to make a night
attack I think we could have
brought it off -- But the division
commander vetoed the idea At least
I made the offer I still believe a
small party has a better chance
than a large one but with your two
casualties you might need another
couple of volunteers

(MORE )
(turnifLto TAdEA contd)

I leave you that decision

Queen comes up to Tall a few minutes later

QUEEN

Colonel Id like to go with ‘em
COL TALL

Why
QUEEN

Because of what the Japs done to
them two guys from 2nd Battalion
three days ago I aint forgotten
it either and I want to get
myself a few of them personally
before I get knocked off or shot
up I figure Capn Gaffs
operation1ll be my best
opportunity

For a moment Tall cannot help believing he is being made the
victim of some kind of elaborate and tasteless hoax lst Sgt
Welsh for one has a mind capable of such subtle ridicule

COL TALL
Soldier are you serious Theres a
war on here Im busy Ive got a
battle to fight

QUEEN
Yes I mean Yes sir Im serious

COL TALL
Sergeant Im a professional
soldier Requests for personal
vendetta offend and bore me If you
want to go with Captain Gaff
youll have to go talk to him about
it and ask him Im busy You can
tell him that I dont object to
your going Now goddamn it go
away

QUEEN
Yes sir Thank you sir

Shortly afterwards Gaff approaches his little assault party -
- Bell and Witt Dale and Doll

GAFF
Sgt Queens coming with us

The four volunteers are treated to the awesome spectacle of
Big Queen looming over them in the dawn still clutching his
shotgun and bandolier of shells which he clung to so dearly
all through the terror of yesterday in his US-made shell
hole

DALE
If they dont get us some water up
here soon we aint none of us
going to make it to the top of this
hill

He says it loud enough to be heard by everybody in the
vicinity He rolls over to face the looming shape of Hill 209
in their rear and begins to shake his fist at it

DALE
Monkeyfuckers Dirty bastards
Fucking pigs You got all the
fucking water in the world and you
drinking ever fucking drop of it
too You aint lettin’ any of it et
past you up to us are you Well
you better get some of it up here
to your goddamn fightin’ men or
you can take your goddamn fucking
battle and shove it up your ass

His protest REVERBERATES along the ledge but nobody pays any
attention to it The rest of it tapers away into a mutter as
Col Tall now saunters over to Gaff baton in hand

COL TALL
John well be back of you If you
can break through well come
pouring after Well charge at your
whistle signal

Then they are off and crawling along the ledge which curves
away out of sight around the side of the hill Gaff in the
lead

BELL
Better let me take the point sir

Gaff turns back to look at him the ex-officer then with an
abrupt gesture of both head and hand admits his small error
and signals Bell to go on past him
EXT LEDGE WHERE TROUGH BEGINS —- DAY

When Bell reaches the point where the trough begins and Lt
Gore died he stops and they all cluster up Gaff does not
bother to give them any pep talk

GAFF
You all know the job weve clot to
do fellows Theres no point in my
going over it again Im convinced
the toughest part will be the open
space between the end of the trough
here and the shoulder of the knob
Once we get past that it wont be
so bad Remember that we may run
into smaller emplacements along the
way Id rather by-pass them if we
can but we may have to knock them
out Okay thats all When we get
up to them we ought to have some
fun

He stops and smiles at them looking each man in the eyes in
turn a happy adventuresome smile There are several weak
smiles in reply similar to his own if not as strong Only
Witts and Queens seem to be really deep But they are all
grateful to him Since yesterday all of them have come to
like him very much He treats them like equals They would
follow him anywhere

GAFF
Once we get through this mess and
back down off the line I promise
you the biggest drunk of your
lives My treat Ill be leading
from here on out I want to pick
the route myself If anything
should happen to me Sergeant Bell
will be in command so I want him
last Sergeant Dale will be second
in command They both know what to
do Lets go

EXT TROUGH TO KNOB - DAY

Suddenly they are out and crawling along the narrow
familiar trough Gaff in the lead each man careful of the
spot where the trough opens out into the ledge and Lt Gore
got himself killed

Gaff looks off toward the strongpoint but without raising
his head high enough to see anything above the grass Are

they waiting Are they watching Are they looking at this

particularly open spot He cannot know

With a sudden gasp he bounces up and takes off with his
rifle at high port running agonizingly slowly and pulling
his knees up high to clear the matted kunai grass like a
football player running through stacks of old tires Not a
shot is fired He dives in behind the shoulder of the knob
and lies there After waiting a full minute he motions the
next man Queen to come on Queen takes off running in the
same way the shotgun in his hands his helmet straps
flagging Just before he reaches the shoulder a single
machine gun OPENS UP but he dives to safety The machine gun
STOPS

The third man Doll falls He is only about five yards out
when several MGs OPEN UP They are watching this time It is
only twenty yards across the open space but it seems much
longer He is already breathing in ripping gasps Then his
foot catches in a hole in the mat of old grass and he is
down Oh no his mind screams at him in panic Not me Not
after all the rest thats happened to me Blindly spitting
grass seeds and dust he clambers up and staggers on He has
ten yards more to go and he makes it

But now all the MGs from the strongpoint are FIRING hosing
down the trough itself as well as the open space BULLETS
tear over the heads of Dale Witt and Bell in bunches which
RATTLE and bruise the thin bushes It is now Dales turn to
go and he is furious

BELL
Hey wait Wait Dont go yet I
got an idea

Dale gives him one hate-filled contemptuous look and gets to
his feet He departs without a word chugging along solidly
like a little engine He arrives behind the shoulder and sits
down apparently totally unmoved but still bristling with
anger Nothing has touched him

GAFF
You must be out of your mind

Maliciously Dale settles in to see what Bell and Witt will
do now Heh heh Not that he wants them to get hurt or
anything

Bell demonstrates his idea immediately When he and Witt have
crawled to the end of the trough the MGs still FIRING just

over their heads Bell pulls the pin on a grenade and lobs it
at the strongpoint But he does not throw it straight across

he throws it into the angle formed by the ledge and the
trough so that it lands in front of the bunker but away
toward the ledge When the MGs all swing that way as they do
immediately he and Witt cross in safety before they can
swing back

Clearly the three of them could have done it just as easily
and when he throws himself down grinning in the safety behind
the shoulder Bell winks at Charlie Dale again Dale glowers

back

EXT KNOB AND SADDLE - DAY

Gaff said the rest of the route would be easier once they
were past the open space and he is right The terrain mounts
steeply around the knob which juts out of the ridge and up
here the mat of grass is not quite so thick but now they are
forced to crawl It is next to impossible to see the
camouflaged emplacements until they open up and they cannot
take any chances They all know from yesterday that beyond
the knob is a shallow saddle between the knob and the rock
wall where the ledge ends and it is along this saddle which
they are to crawl to come down on the Japanese from above

When they reach the beginning of the saddle sweating and
half-dead from lack of water Gaff motions them to stop He
has to swallow his dry spittle several times before he can
speak Remembering that the other platoons will charge at the
sound of his whistle he unhooks it from his pocket

GAFF
I want to get as close to them as
we can before we put the grenades
to them Well fellows this is
where we separate the sheep from
the goats Lets crawl

He clamps his whistle in his teeth and cradling his rifle
while holding a grenade in one hand he commences to do so

EXT JAPANESE STRONGPOINT (THE ATTACK) —- DAY

Slowly as they crawl the entire strongpoint becomes visible
-- its nearer right end only twenty-five yards away and
only a very few yards below their own height And it is just
as they can finally see it that they are discovered by the
Japanese

Five scrawny bedraggled Japanese men pop up out of the
ground holding dark round objects which they lob up the hill
at them Fortunately only one of the five grenades EXPLODES

It lights near Dale who rolls over twice away from it and
then lies huddled as close to the ground as he can get his
face turned away None of its fragments hit him but it makes
his ears ring

GAFF
Pull and throw Pull and throw

Almost as one man their six grenades arch at the
strongpoint The five Japanese men who popped up out of the
ground have by now popped back down into it But as the
grenades light two other unlucky Japanese pop up to throw
One grenade lights between the feet of one of these and
EXPLODES up into him blowing off one of his feet and putting
him down Fragments put the other one down All of the
American grenades EXPLODE

The Japanese with his foot off lies still a moment then
struggles up to sit holding another grenade as the blood
pours from his severed leg Doll SHOOTS him He falls back
dropping the ignited grenade beside him It does not go off

GAFF
Again Again

Again six grenades arch in the air This time there are four
Japanese standing when the grenades light one of them
carrying a light MG The EXPLODING grenades put three of them
down including the man with the Nambu and the fourth
thinking better of it disappears down a hole

GAFF
Go in

In a moment all of them are on their feet running The
Japanese have shrewdly taken advantage of the terrain to save
themselves digging work Behind the holes into the
emplacements themselves is a natural little low area where
they can come out and sit in cover when they are not actually
being shelled Now in this hollow the scrawny bedraggled
Japanese rise with rifles swords and pistols from their
holes to meet Gaff and his crew At least some of them do
Others stay in the holes Three try to run Dale SHOOTS one
and Bell SHOOTS another The third disappears in a grand
broad jump over the edge of the rock face where it falls
clear sixty or eighty feet to the jungle treetops below The
others come on And Gaff and his troops the Captain blowing
his whistle run to meet them in clear view of the rest of C-
for-Charlie down at the ledge below

Queen kills five men almost at once His SHOTGUN blows the
first nearly in two and tears enormous chunks out of the
second and third

While he struggles to unsling the rifle from his back he is
attacked by a screaming officer with a sword Gaff SHOOTS the
officer in the belly from the hip Bell has killed two men
and Dale two Doll who has drawn his pistol is charged by
another screaming officer who shouts “Banzai” over and over
and who runs at him whirling his bright gleaming sword
around his head in the air Doll SHOOTS him through the chest
so that in a strange laughable way his legs keep right on
running while the rest of him falls down behind them

Witt peers into a cave A bat flies out startling him A
soldier approaches with a flamethrower at the ready

Witt has SHOT three men one of them a huge fat sergeant
wielding a black cavalry saber Taking the overhead saber cut
on the stock of his rifle cutting it almost to the barrel
Witt butt-strokes him in the jaw Now he SHOOTS him where he
lies Suddenly there is an enormous quiet except for the
wailing chatter of three Japanese standing in a row who have
dropped their weapons

Slowly they look around at each other and discover the
miraculous fact that none of them is killed or even
seriously damaged Gaff has a knot on his jaw from firing
without checking his stock Bells helmet has been shot from
his head Numbly they stare at each other

Queen now advances snarling on the three standing Japanese
Taking two by their scrawny necks he shakes them back and
forth gaggling helplessly until their helmets fall off
Then grinning savagely he begins beating their heads
together

QUEEN
Fucking murderers Fucking yellow
Jap bastards Killing helpless
prisoners Fucking murderers

The others stand breathing hard and watching When he drops
them they fall unconscious blood running from their noses

QUEEN
That’1l teach them to kill
prisoners

He turns to the third who simply looks at him
uncomprehendingly But Gaff jumps in between them

GAFF
We need him

Queen walks away without a word It is then they hear the
first SHOUTS from the other side and remember they are not
the only living

Going to the grassy bank they see the same field they
themselves tried to cross last evening Coming across it ata
run the rest of C-for-Charlie is charging uphill toward the
strongpoint according to Colonel Talls plan coming
straight at them yelling

Whatever their reason they are little late The fight is
already over Or so everyone thinks Waving and cheering
ironically and hooting derision at the heroes their
pretended rescuers Gaff’s men are interrupted by the sound
of a MACHINE GUN Directly below them in one of the
apertures a single MG opens up and begins to FIRE at 2nd
Platoon As Gaff’s men watch incredulously two men go down
Dale who is standing nearest to the door of the embrasure
which is FIRING leaps over with a shocked look on his face
and throws a grenade down the hole The grenade immediately
comes flying right back out Everyone hits the dirt
Fortunately the grenade has been thrown too hard and it
EXPLODES just as it falls over the lip of the rock face The
MG below continues to FIRE

WITT
(to Dale)
Look out you jerk

Scrambling to his feet Witt pulls the pin on a grenade and
holding it with the lever depressed grabs his rifle and runs
over to the hole Leaning around the right side of it
holding his rifle like a pistol in his left hand with the
stock pressed against his leg he begins to FIRE the
semiautomatic Garand into the hole There is a YELL from
below Still FIRING Witt pops the grenade down the hole and
ducks back He continues to FIRE to confuse the occupants
Then the grenade blows up with a ROAR cutting off both the
scrabble of yells and the MG which has never stopping
firing

Immediately others of the little force without any
necessity of orders from Gaff begin bombing out the other
four holes using Witt’s technique one man FIRING while
another tosses the grenades They BOMB them all whether
there is anybody in them or not There is a joyous feeling in
the safety of killing Slapping each other on the back and
grinning at each other murderously they call to the C-for-
Charlie men below to come on

Colonel Tall appears at the top of the embankment followed
by Captain Stein Two of the platoons continue pushing uphill
to protect the new position Tall shakes Gaffs hand

COL TALL
Look at them move We owe it all to
you John When they saw you make
that attack of yours and win
(MORE )

It was 1ik€Ofou TAlgutcainei¢) hearts
back into them

The Japanese two dozen of them lie scattered around in
various positions and postures Some are still in the process
of dying and a few though badly hurt look as if they might
live

DOLL
It was Big Un and his shotgun He
set ‘em back on their heels

Queen prowls back and forth and around the single remaining
prisoner like a loose wolf trying to get at a caged victim
He appears to be waiting hopefully for the Japanese to make
any move for which he can legitimately kill him The prisoner
himself looks as though he would not be capable of escaping
anywhere even if there were no one around to watch him

Filthy and emaciated he has a bad case of dysentery and is
continually indicating to his guards through a system of
signs and pantomime that he has to relieve himself He has
already messed his pants a couple of times apparently and
all in all he is a pretty sorry spectacle

COL TALL
What happened here

Tall has turned away in disgust from the living prisoner to
look at the two whose heads Queen knocked together They lie
side by side unconscious Except for the blood running from
their noses they show no signs of injury or wounds Gaff
merely raises his eyebrows as though he didn’t know either
But Tall can read well enough what has happened even if he
cannot understand the method They should have been
bayoneted or shot He doesn’t like this sort of thing but
one has to make allowances for men in the heat of combat

COL TALL

Some sort of explosive concussion
No fragment wounds

(Gaff does not answer)
Well a dead brown brother is one
brown brother less isnt it Take
good care of the others men G-2
will want them There should be
someone around before long

THORNE
Aye aye sir yeah Well take
care of him

One of the PRISONERS GUARDS reaches out with his rifle
muzzle and pokes him tipping him over backward into his own
mess The men around all laugh and the prisoner scrambles to
his feet He appears to expect this kind of treatment and
looks as if he were only putting in time waiting for them to
shoot him

STEIN
Say there

COL TALL
Dont do that soldier

THORNE
Okay sir if you say so sir But
he would of killed me in a minute
if hed had the chance

COL TALL
I think weve wasted about enough
time here

GAFF
Sir Sir Ive got a few
recommendations for decorations Id
like to turn in to you

COL TALL
Yes yes of course Well get
everything for all of them that we
can But later In the meantime I
want you to know Im personally
recommending you for something
John Perhaps -- the Big One

GAFF
Well thank you sir But I dont
feel I really deserve that

COL TALL
Oh yes you do Getting it for you
will be another problem But it
would be a big thing for the
battalion and for the regiment
too if you did get it We better
get moving out or here We need to
extend our lines to hook up with
the other companies and push on
toward the top Would you like to
take command of Baker Company on
the left

Gaff steals a glance at Stein then nods uneasily He will
not be a party to a snub

GAFF
Sir I don’t like to be a wet
blanket or anything like that but
what about water If we don’t --

COL TALL
Dont worry about water John I
dont want anything to break up
this attack of ours now that weve
got the momentum As for water
Ive already taken care of that
Well have some water by -- ina
couple of hours Ive arranged for
that We can’t stop now to wait for
it

GAFF
No sir

COL TALL
If some of the men pass out
theyll just have to pass out

(as Gaff nods)

If any of them ask you about water
tell them what I said Dont bring
it up yourself Dont mention it
unless they ask you

GAFF
No sir But they could die from
it you know Heat prostration

COL TALL
They could die from enemy fire
too They’re all tough boys Okay

He turns away to wave his baton at some of the men who are
still staring curiously at the various dead Japanese

COL TALL
Youll see plenty more of those
Come on lets get cracking Are we
going up this hill or arent we

On a sudden impulse Tall returns to Gaff and taking his
arm leads him gently away from the others

COL TALL
John Im convinced the Japanese
position can be broken now
(MORE)

All we hav€Ofo dALis( detpgping and
well have this hill by sundown
You see the new spirit in these
men I want to take advantage of it
before something happens to sap
their strength

(avoiding Gaff’s eyes)
To have this battalion relieved in
defeat even to have it reinforced
by troops from the reserve regiment
if we stall before reaching the

top is -- more than I can stand
Someday youll know what I mean
John

Hes studied and worked and slaved and eaten untold
buckets of shit to have this opportunity He doesn’t intend
to lose it now He leaves Gaff and without looking back at
him calls out suddenly to the assembling men

COL TALL

I want three runners Okay You
three Go back to the rear as far
as you have to go to find water
and bring it back with you Take
whatever you find at gunpoint if
necessary Dont even report to the
regimental commander Get back here
as fast as you can with it If they
stop you tell them the strongpoint
is taken were moving uphill If
anyone tries to take any water from
you youre to fight for it with
your firearms

(to Stein)
You take the center Captain Gaff
and I will bring the other
companies up on the left and
right Wait an hour for us to get
them in place Then attack Well
throw everything weve got at them
Once the companies are linked up
well move uphill together ina
line Nothings stopping us Were
going all the way High ground by
nightfall

He raises his arm in the air and a CHEER goes up from the
group of men around him Lt Band looks at him with awe

COL TALL
(to Band privately)
Lieutenant last night they cut our
phone lines back to the rear
(MORE)

Dont be if€Qiny TALIrgcamt répair
them We attack in one hour It is
now twelve thirty-eight on my
mark Mark

While Tall and Gaff go off Stein takes Lt Band aside

STEIN
George I cant look after
everything Im putting you in
charge of Beckers platoon and
Weapons It will be like an
independent command

LT BAND
Let us lead it off sir

STEIN
(after eyeing him warily)
All right

Band smiles his eager smile An independent command

Meanwhile a group of men from C-for-Charlie has gathered
around the Japanese prisoners fascinated by the first sight
of their enemy living and breathing though strangely so
unformidable Eight more nave been rounded up and aced under
guard with the one Queen spared They are being interrogated
by a timid young OFFICER from G-2 and a NISEI INTERPRETER

The prisoners are a sorry sick-looking lot Feeble
stumbling they shamble along appearing to be totally
benumbed by their experiences and looking as though they
would not have the energy or the will to escape even if they
were guarded by just one GI All of them are suffering from
dysentery jaundice and malaria Two of them (just why no
one seems to know) are stark bare-ass naked They look like
some lower grade of animal with their ribs and shoulder
bones showing starkly through their yellow skin

NISEI INTERPRETER
They say theyve all been living
off lizards and the bark off of
trees for the past couple of weeks

DOLL
Ask ‘em if they was scared

Doll gives one of them a cigarette as the Nisei translates
the question The Japanese man looks embarrassed but
grateful

NISEI INTERPRETER
He says they were too sick to feel
much of anything They were sorry
to see their captain die

THORNE
Hey Jap Come on Jap Tell the
truth Aint you glad you dont
have to fight no more now Hunh
Aint you

The Japanese man he addresses who obviously does not
understand a word bobs and bows and nods his head smiling
numbly

THORNE
See there I told you They dont
want to fight no more than we do
Whats all this Emperor shit

TILLS
Just you dont give him your loaded
rifle and then see how much he
want to fight

G-2 OFFICER
We need to get these prisoners back
to Regiment as soon as possible I
need a detail

They ignore him One of the prisoners a SERGEANT who
declined a cigarette when one was offered him speaks quietly
to the Nisei

THORNE
Whatd he say

NISEI INTERPRETER

Nothing

THORNE
What do you mean I saw him talking
to you

NISEI INTERPRETER

He said that if he acted that way
in front of his lieutenant the
officer would pull his gun out and
shoot him

(as Thorne smiles lamely)
He keeps asking me how can I do
this

EXT HILLSIDE - DAY

The prisoners are being led away by their guards among them
Thorne Coombs Carni and Kirk Whooping and hollering they
descend the steep hillside in a sort of nonsensical hysteria
of cruel fun slipping and sliding booting the prisoners and
laughing whenever they fall When one of the charges falls
so ill that he can hardly move however they stop to
discuss the situation

THORNE
I say shoot the fucker

COOMBS
You know the Colonel ordered us to
get them all back alive

THORNE
So well say he tried to escape

COOMBS
Him Look at him

THORNE
So wholl see him

KIRK
Im with Thorne Remember what they
did to our guys on the Bataan Death
March

COOMBS
Shorty gave us personal orders You
know damn well hes gonna check up
if one turns up missin’ What if he
has Intelligence ask these other
guys what happened to their buddy
I dont want to get in trouble
thats all

The Japanese senses he has a champion in Coombs and bows
gratefully

THORNE
Well it’s either that or carry
him I’m not about to carry no
fuckin’ Jap all the way back to
Regiment Are you Anyway I
outrank you I’m a corporal I say
kill him Look at him Be doin’ the
poor fuck a favor

KIRK
2nd Battalion found where theyd
been eatin’ one of their own men
Strung him up from a branch like a
deer Took strips off his back two
inches wide They eat people

Carni steps forward and puts in for the first time He has
been thinking it over the pros and cons

CARNI
Coombs is right Shorty’s sure to
check up if one is missin’ If we
shoot him or lose him he’1l be on
our ass like a bullwhip Might even
court-martial us

Thorne stares at the Japanese man then shrugs and grins
ruefully

THORNE
Okay I guess youre right It
looks like we carry him All right
then Come on Ill take a leg Who
wants the rest of him

EXT CP — DAY

Fife and Storm have returned to the company They are treated
as objects of extreme curiosity even in the midst of the
battle Men who’ve come back from the gone Questions fly in
from all sides Everyone in the company who has not been hurt
beyond the normal minor bruises and cuts carries the guilt of
a well man who through no fault of his own has not
suffered

STORM

fucking thing Them doctors are
tough Theyre not lettin’ anybody

FIFE

WELD

Weld looks at him with a cold-eyed insolent smile It is

about to turn loose of his newly acquired status if he can
help it

WELSH

Goddamn you I notice you didnt
make anybody mess sergeant in
Stormys place

WELSH
(grinning insolently)
Storm asked me to wait -- he
thought he might be comin’ back

Why does it make his heart sink to find he is no longer
Welshs clerk Why doesnt he rejoice

FIFE
Goddamn you Welsh Goddamn you
you son of a bitch

WELSH
Im getting tired of teaching you
punk asshole kids that you don t
mean a goddamn thing to the world
Not to the country not to the war
to nobody This Armys going to
spend you like dollar bills

(MORE )

You can al WEdSH (contadby day one
by one -- and it won t mean a
goddamn fucking thing to anybody as
long as theres replacements Who
the fuck do you think you are You
think you mean anything to this
comp ny

Welsh could not have chosen a more wounding thing to say He
knows it and falls silent for a moment as though ashamed

WELSH

You punks are all learning now --
and Oh does it hurt This wars
only starting Behind this compny
theres ten others like it
stretching clear back to
Washington all of them dedicated
to getting you up here full
equipped to get your asses lowed
off You’re just part of a machine
Youre a cog You cant do a
fucking thing about it This aint
no war this is a regulated
business venture

(after a pause)
You dont know no more about it
than a pig knows about Sunday

Since yesterday Welsh has the same drawn haunted face and
wrinkled too-bright eyes they all wear but unlike them he
feels triumphant -- triumphant because everything has turned
out exactly as he anticipated thus leaving him with no real
shock or trauma rather with his iron contempt intact

FIFE
You dont believe in nothing do
you Welsh

WELSH
Property Im the only sane man in
the fucking outfit

FIFE
You bastard

Fortunately Lt Band appears at just this moment Welsh
leaps up to shout Attention while he Weld and Fife all
snap to

LT BAND
You dont have to call attention
every time I show up Sergeant
Ive told you that

(MORE )

Certainly ddt BAND Eaiiteld) Well

Hello there Fife So you made it

back Were glad to have you back

with the old outfit Have you seen
my helmet

Band takes off his helmet and shows Fife where a Japanese
bullet has passed through the shell Fife listens to him in
silence

FIFE
Well now thats remarkable sir I
wish I could have seen my helmet I
never saw it

Fifes voice shakes with fury and Welsh grins to himself
Everybody in the company has already heard about Bands
helmet

LT BAND
Its too bad you couldnt have kept
it for a souvenir Well then
Corporal Fife I guess we better
decide what to do about you then
Fife Hunh Since Weld here is now
corporal and clerk we cant very
well demote him back to private
Neither can we have two clerks And
since Weld is older than Fife
besides being considerably less
well-trained I dont see how we can
send him off to take second command
of a rifle squad

All Fifes anger runs out of him like water as he realizes
the tack Band is taking and he decides too late that he
could have been much nicer about Bands helmet Terror
balloons in him as he remembers that hellish exposed slope
down there

LT BAND
Soo -- How would you like to become
second in command of a top-rated
rifle squad Fife Sergeant Jenkss
squad of the 3rd Platoon has no
corporal Youll see plenty of
action I guarantee it

WELSH
Sir Sergeant Dranno back at Rear
Echelon has been devilling me to
give him someone to help him Hes
had a lot of work over casualties
since this action

(MORE )

And hes gdéfiigdHiaentadpt more
Fife here has more clerical
knowledge than anybody in the
company except for Dranno

LT BAND
All right Now you have a choice
Fife Which do you prefer

FIFE
Ill work for Dranno

LT BAND
All right When do you want him to
leave Sergeant

WELSH
Today

LT BAND
There you are Corporal Okay You
can go

NEW ANGLE

Fife walks off nodding but once he is alone the rebellion
comes All of his fury returns his fury at Welsh his fury
at Band his fury at the world Fuck them Fuck them all

VOICES
Moving out in ten minutes Check
your ammo Fix bayonets

He knows what he feels is unrealistic he knows he will
regret it immediately he is sure he is signing his own death
warrant but in spite of the fear and terror which fill him
in equal parts with fury and sorrow he will not go back
there to work for Dranno He finds Band still with the first
sergeant

FIFE
Lt Band sir I changed my mind
Id like to stay Id like to go
with the rifle squad

Welshs face turns so red it appears his whole head will
burst but he says not a word in front of Band The
Lieutenant gives Fife a curiously sharp look which makes Fife
wonder if he has not been actually and actively seduced But
it is too late now

LT BAND
Okay Report to Jenkss squad

As Fife anticipated no sooner does he leave than he
immediately regrets what he has done The only real pleasure
was the look on Welshs face

EXT CP AREA - DAY

Ten minutes ago Beckers men were laughing and proud Now
suddenly they are quiet their eyes starry with fear Becker
comes to Lt Band with a deeply frowning face

BECKER

Lieutenant I was wondering if you
couldnt put my platoon in company
reserve My boys’ve had it tougher
than any of the other platoons
Theyve had more casualties and
are more under-strength They
deserve a break

(after a pause)
It aint fair to put my boys out
there all the time

Band might have acceded to the request if Becker had not
spoken Now he jerks his head up to stare at him

LT BAND
Fair Whats not fair Whats fair
got to do with it No Im afraid
Ill have to deny your request
Sergeant Your platoon is the best
weve got Theyve got more
experience theyre tougher they
belong out in front

BECKER
Is that an order then sir

LT BAND
Im afraid it is Sergeant

BECKER
In other words the more of us get
killed gettin’ experience the more
of us got to get killed usin’ it

LT BAND
As I said fair has nothing to do
with it Unfortunately In a war
everything useful has to be used
Here its me who decides what is
most useful where Any other
questions Sergeant Becker

BECKER
No sir

LT BAND
Then thats all

BECKER
Aye aye sir

Becker scuttles away in a blind rage Poor man Band thinks
believing he has handled it pretty well

LT BAND
Sergeant

Becker swings around He is only fifteen feet away Nobody
else is close enough to overhear what Band now says

LT BAND
I want to tell you something
Sergeant Do you know why our
platoons going up first Do you
know why theyre moving out first
today in this attack Because I
volunteered us for it

BECKER
You what

Becker crouches almost as if to charge him Band raises his
eyebrows Becker is too old a hand not to know what this
means

BECKER
Sir

LT BAND
Thats right And do you know why I
did It was because I felt with
our superior combat experience
wed be more useful To Regiment
to the Division to everybody

BECKER
Is that all sir

LT BAND
Thats all Sergeant

EXT WATER HOLE —- DAY

2nd Platoon has discovered a little water hole The men lie
around it on their bellies drinking the muddy water up
greedily until Doll wades out into the middle of the hole
and pulls a dead Japanese soldier up from the bottom by the
scruff of his neck All of them recoil in disgust all except
Dale

DALE
Everybodys got to drink a little
enemy blood Some time or other

BECKER
Lets go Bells squad up on the
right Dales squad up on the left
Make a line make a line Lock and
load

EXT FLANKS (BURNT SLOPES) OF HILL 210 - DAY

Jenkss squad will lead it off Mazzi kisses a mortar round
and drops it down the tube as they begin to lay down FIRE on
the slope above them Fife sits watching a pair of blue
butterflies bounce above the grass tops As he gets himself
ready he can hardly believe what is happening to him It
takes every ounce of courage he has not to turn and run As
they start to crawl away his teeth are chattering and he is
shaking like a leaf from head to toe

JENKS
Come on damn it Get movin’

Fifes heart beats wildly as MUSIC comes in through the
Japanese drums He realizes this is his moment of truth his
moment to become a soldier a man How precious this despised
world seems to him now that he stands on the verge of
leaving it forever Thornes cries and moans when he gos
down nearby unnerve him further Why cant he keep his mouth
shut Fife did

Gradually a new courage swells inside him a joy He tries
to do better helping Jenks keep the squad together
pretending he is not unnerved that he is not thinking of all
the unreckonable ways to get killed Fear drops away from him
like a shroud and miraculously he is free

The speed and power with which C-for-Charlie moves up Hill
210 is more than even Tall hoped for Within fifteen minutes
they have hooked up with the other companies and the whole
line is bowling along uphill

The Japanese they flush from their holes and various
emplacements which literally honeycomb the ridge are almost
without exception the same starved-looking sick emaciated
types they found at the strongpoint only now most are burned
or blackened by the fires that have spread across the slope

EXT FLANKS OF HILL 210 - DAY
A YOUNG SOLDIER turns to Witt

YOUNG SOLDIER
I never been shot at before Is
this what it sounds like

WITT
This is what it sounds like We’re
bein’ shot at

Witt sees the Colonel far below Until today he has never
really much liked Tall finding him a cold fish-eye of an
intellectual textbook soldier But today he loves them all
passionately with an almost sexual ecstasy of comradeship
Even Bugger Stein and Welsh come under the magnanimous aura
of his warm affection today The idea of service to humanity
of comradeship of the solidarity of men is slowly perishing
from the world but in Witt it still runs strong

Watching the first wave move up the hill he feels the
mysterious quality of deep manly friendship which can exist
between men who share the pain and death the fear and
sadness of combat -- the happiness too For there is
happiness Happiness in doing your best happiness in
fighting by the side of your friend happiness in feeling the
highest in yourself may be drawn forth at last

Witt mutters under his breath If Tall had let Bugger proceed
with his outflanking move they might have saved themselves a
lot of good men He turns to Bell

WITT
I couldve kept tella from getting
killed Catch Gordon I wasnt
able to help a one of them I cant
be everywheres at once

VOICES
Whats holding you up Keep moving
Whats holding you up

A wandering squad of Japanese COUNTERATTACKS the Weapons
Platoon as they are coming up behind catching them
completely off guard There aren’t supposed to be any
Japanese around here Finally they are compelled to run

Buttplate in one hand and carbine in the other Frankie Mazzi
swings around backward to crash through the face-whipping
screen of leaves Once through he swings to turn face front
again and suddenly feels himself speared caught and then
held He knows what it is but he can’t think clearly enough
to do anything about it Some thing has grabbed hold of his
ammo belt near his right hip bone Unable to believe it
plunging and cursing and listening to rifle bullets
SNICKERWHACK through the brush around him he remains
tethered still holding buttplate in one hand and carbine in
the other And he knows he will still be here when they come
for him shoot him cook him and eat him

When two men from the mortar section push past him running
hurriedly and obliviously he begins to call in a feeble
moronic plaintive voice the same word over and over

MAZZI
Help Help Help

To his eternal shame it is Tills who comes back for him
Eyes glaring wildly also running hurriedly in a crouch he
comes up surveys the scene and frees him Mazzi has been
pushing and plunging forward all the time Tills merely
shoves him backward two feet and the snag comes free Then
making a lip-lifting mock of a grin he spits brown from the
quid in his jaw and runs on

When they come out into the bright eye-beating light of
safety behind their own still-advancing lines they see the
other members of the squad already setting up resetting the
bubble levels

MAZZI
Just dont think it makes me like
you any better

TILLS
Done thank ut makes me lack yew any
butter

Mazzi stares at him with hatred certain he will tell

Meanwhile Stein watches his men work their way around an MG
emplacement

WITT
We took out that emplacement sir
We can go ahead

Witt could throw his arms around his commander in an ecstasy
of loving comradeship Except that it might get taken the
wrong way

STEIN
Good job Witt Why don’t you stay
here and have yourself a rest

WITT
I ruther be with the comp’ny sir
I mean you know with the
platoons I always feel like maybe
I could help somebody you know
Maybe save somebody

It is the first time he has ever told anyone his secret
Stein stares at him quizzically and Witt curses himself He
learned long ago in his life never to tell anybody anything
about what he really felt -- what made him do it now

STEIN
Okay Report to Becker Tell him I
just appointed you acting sergeant

WITT
But Im not even in the comp’ny
sir officially

STEIN
Well worry about all that later
WITT
Aye sir
STEIN
Looks like were in luck today
Witt

Witt looks at him a moment then nods and crawls away Now
before Stein can give the order the platoons move out on
their own Stein runs forward among them

STEIN
Go on Go on Dont stop now

He hears his own voice bellowing and he knows nobody can hear
him but he cannot stop it and he cannot stop waving his
arms The men charge up until the crest of the hill comes
INTO VIEW

STEIN
Hot damn Hot damn Come on Come
on We got to get up there

He starts off through the grass running Everything
everywhere seems to be ungovernable chaos with the FIRING
the SHOUTS

STEIN
Keep your distance Twenty yards
Form a line

Jenkss squad are on their feet before the grenade shower has
even EXPLODED They run uphill hollering and yelling Fife
scampers along with them panting and sweating Nothing
touches him On his right the usually imperturbable Jenks
lets out a long shrill screeching quavering rebel yell
Three men go down hollering in the rush Nothing touches
Fife

Then suddenly they are in Over the crest and in -- the
other two squads right behind them running hard but
cautiously between long lovely lines of trees leaping
emplacements like the ones they once looked at with awe and
wonder gasping and weeping and once in a while dying They
are in

EXT JAPANESE BIVOUAC AREA - DAY

Fife has no trouble shooting When he first sees the scrawny
tattered scarecrow yellow men FIRING their rifles and MGs
intently he can hardly believe it and feels astonished When
he sees one Japanese in a hole whirl with a grenade in his
hand and stare at him wide-eyed he SHOOTS him through the
chest and watches him fall Then he looks around for more
targets and sees a Japanese running trying to make the
jungle Head down arms pumping he runs in total despair
like a man on a too-swift treadmill which is carrying him
backward Fife leads him just a hair and SHOOTS him through
the left side just below the armpit shouting with elation as
the man tumbles with a yell just feet away from the jungle
and safety

When Stein reaches the crest of the hill he beholds a scene
which will remain with him the rest of his life His
bloodthirsty platoons have burst into what is clearly a
Japanese bivouac area The tall jungle trees have climbed up
out of the gulches and established themselves here on this
crest The Japanese have cleared out all the undergrowth so
that what is taking place here now is taking place as though
in some park The only thing that is not like a park is the
glue mud which is everywhere the ground In this natural
setting Steins platoons are SHOOTING and killing Japanese
in what appear to be carload lots

There are no tents visible but there are surface shelters of
branches and sticks which the Japanese have made themselves
and there are underground dugouts The first are being SHOT
to pieces or knocked apart with rifle butts The underground
shelters are being BOMBED OUT with grenades

Stein sees at a glance there will be no way of getting these
men organized for quite some time A crazy sort of blood
lust like some sort of declared school holiday from all
moral ethics has descended on them They can kill with
impunity and they are doing it Several Japanese plead for
their lives One sits meditating as though preparing himself
for death

Queen runs laughing and bellowing on arriving back in time
to SHOOT a Japanese officer who rising from a hole and
whirling his sword on high runs at them screaming to die for
his Emperor Queen tears the scabbard away from him jams the
sword in it sticks it all in his belt and rushes on

VOICES
Queens back Romp and stomp

QUEEN
Show me them Japs

Fife scampers along SHOOTING every Japanese he can see
filled with both terror and elation Then Jenks goes down
with a loud squawk and a rifle bullet through the shoulder

JENKS
You take the squad

Now Fife has the squad to himself and the responsibility
and finds he loves it and all of them A new confidence has
surged up in him a manliness a wild reckless joy

The whole area is honeycombed with rifle pits and MG
emplacements and it was obviously the Japanese commanders
intention to sell it very dearly But now having heard such
great enemy firing on their flanks and even in their rear
the Japanese begin to come up out of their holes and
surrender sick haggard beaten-looking men obviously
terrified at the treatment they expect to receive at the
hands of their enemy Those who make the mistake of coming up
with their weapons in their hands are taken care of
immediately

The others who come out empty-handed and hands up are
socked punched beaten prodded and hammered with rifle
butts but rarely -- only in a few instances -- are they
actually killed But nobody likes them very well and those
who refuse to do as they are told are SHOT out of hand by
tense-faced nerve-racked men who want no fucking nonsense
One by one the MGs are silenced Some of the riflemen elect
to SHOOT it out and die in their pits Others leap up and run
for the jungle leading to their own rear if such a term as
rear applies in this crazy campaign Few reach it The
whole thing goes quickly

When they arrive at the center of the bivouac they find the
majority of the Japanese KILLING themselves with grenades
guns or knives which is just as well because those who do
not surrender immediately are SHOT or bayoneted

Stein looks around to see the other companies pouring in from
the left and right flanks The main fight is over C-for-
Charlie has borne the brunt of it and gained the victory A
few of the men sit down and weep

COL TALL
Well Stein we did it son We did
it

Colonel Tall strides up to Stein and shakes his hand There
is further handshaking with the sergeants

STEIN
Excuse me sir What about the
water Have you --

COL TALL
Im sorry about that Stein Now
what do you think are the chances
of a counterattack I still hear
gunfire over on the left

The moping up proves to be a pretty big operation There are
still many unreduced emplacements scattered across the
bivouac and the hillsides beyond it Many of the Japanese
prefer to die rather than be captured Some are too sick even
to surrender and simply sit by their guns FIRING them until
they are killed Those who have surrendered are overcome with
a deep shame and sorrow End on rice cooking or some
domestic scene perhaps on a wind chime or a figure of the
Buddha sitting in obscurity beneath a stand of cocoa trees

EXT JAPANESE BIVOUAC AREA - DAY

Charlie Dale comes to Witt with a bone to pick Witt is
sitting on a rock staring emptily down the hill sorrowful
exhausted and terribly dry The stocky Dale with his
perpetually hunched shoulders and powerful long arms marches
up and stands himself directly in front of Witt to have his
say The SHOOTING is still going on

DALE
I got somethin I want to tell you
Witt
WITT
(absentmindedly)

Yeah Whats that
DALE
You shouldnt ought to talk to me
like you did I dont want you to
do it anymore Thats an order

WITT
What When

DALE
Back there at the strongpoint this
morning You remember Witt

WITT
What did I say

DALE
You called me a jerk when I tossed
that grenade down that one hole and
that Jap tossed it back out Thats
no way to talk to me Im a noncom

now -- it aint dignified In any
case Im orderin you not to do it
no more

Witt looks as if he has been stung by a bee

WITT
Arngh come off it Charlie I
known you when you was a lousy
second cook A not very good one at
that I aint takin any orders from
you You can shove them acting
stripes up your ass

DALE
You called me a jerk

WITT
Well you are a jerk A jerk A
jerk Whats more youre stupid
You should of known better than to
anyway Im an acting sergeant too
myself Stein made me one an hour
ago Now peel off

DALE
Im not a jerk And you wasnt no
acting sergeant when you done it
Anyway I was made before you so I
still outrank you And I aint
scared of you Besides it dont
look good in front of the men
Witt

His voice softens as he thinks of the new thing He says it
as if they were two majors bellying up to the Officers Club
bar

WITT
Men my ass Dale I never hit
nobody without I warn them first
Thats my policy Well Im warning
you Get away from me stay away
If you ever say another word to me
Ill whip your ass

DALE
I think I can whip you

WITT
Then have a go Have a go

DALE
Theres too much work to do around
here right now The mopping ups
just starting I dont want to miss
that

WITT
Anything you want Knives
bayonets fists rifle butts

shooting

DALE
Fists’ll do I dont want to kill
you --

WITT

You couldnt

DALE
I know you been a boxer -- all that
shit I can still whip you

WITT
Yeah

Witt advances on him raising his rifle butt as if to stroke
him in the side of the head with it but Dale backs off He
raises his own rifle which is bayoneted into fighting
position

DALE
Maybe I couldnt whip you But
youll know you been in a fight

WITT
Come on Come on Talk Talk Talk

DALE
Theres too much serious work to do
right now Ill try you later
buddy

WITT
Any time

Dale turns and walks away Witt sits down trembling with a
cold rage Whip him There isnt a man his size in the
regiment who could whip him And he doubts there is anybody
in the regiment who could whip him at bayonet fighting As
for shooting he has been high gun in every regiment hes
served with for the past six years Dont look good in front
of the men Shit

Meanwhile Dale goes to work over the Japanese with a stolen
pair of piers wrenching the gold teeth out of their mouths
His sharp red eyes dart left and right

EXT JAPANESE BIVOUAC AREA - DAY
They are carrying Thorne away on a stretcher

THORNE
Ill be back Itll take more’n a
flesh wound to keep me from coming
back to C-for-Charlie I dont care
where they send me Ill be back if
I have to stow away on a
replacement boat

All the guys are shaking hands with the other guys from the
other companies grinning at each other out of guys b from

faces Many are curious about the Japanese Carni looking

through a billfold displays a picture of a dead soldiers

girlfriend

CARNI
Maybe his sister

Mazzi and Tills glance at each other Mazzi wonders if Tills
has told anyone what happened down the hill It infuriates
him that he cannot enjoy the victory as wholeheartedly as the
others

Fife does not take part in the poking and looking and
souvenir hunting because the corpses make him feel queasy and
vaguely guilty

He watches only for a moment then he has to turn away What
is wrong with him If the rest of the guys can be this tough
why cant he

The scavengers move quickly Nearby one slips a watch off a
dead Japanese lieutenant But really everyone is too tired
too beat and thirsty and exhausted to care about the loot
Later of course they will all regret it Doll comes up to
Fife with a big smile

DOLL
The Colonel wanted to know who it
was up there at the front of the
charge with Jenkss squad The
Captain said it was you Colonel
said that man is a fire-eater the
Japs better watch out He wanted to
know your name and if you were a
sergeant

Bell turns and looks at Fife Someone else smiles causing
Fife to blush At last he feels their equal a good man
capable of truth and sacrifice Fife watches the clouds move
serenely across the wide tropical sky His triumph has made
all things beautiful to him again

EXT JAPANESE BIVOUAC AREA - DAY

The blow falls late that afternoon C-for-Charlie has cleaned
out the bivouac area and captured a number of heavy mortars
as well as two 70mm field guns and been placed along the
crest they have captured The fierce heat is begining to
abate and the first signs of evening appearing when Colonel
Tall calls Stein off to himself

COL TALL
Stein Im relieving you of your
command

His young-old Anglo-Saxon face is set in stern lines Stein
can feel his heart suddenly beating in his ears but he does
not say anything He cannot honestly say he hasnt
anticipated it

COL TALL
Lt Band will take over for you
Ive already told him So you wont
have to

STEIN
(after a silence)
Yes sir
COL TALL
Its a hard thing to do anda
difficult decision to make I just
dont think youll ever make a good
combat officer Ive thought it
over carefully

STEIN
Because of what happened yesterday
morning

COL TALL
In part in part But its really
something else I dont think
youre tough enough I think youre
too soft Too softhearted Not
tough-fibered enough You let your
emotions govern you too much I
think your emotions control you As
I said Ive thought it over
carefully In a war people have to
get killed There dust isnt anyway
around it Stein A good officer
has to accept it and then
calculate the loss in lives against
the potential gain I dont think
you can do that

STEIN
I dont like to see my men get
killed

COL TALL
No good officer does But he has to
be able to face it Sometimes he
has to be able to order it In any
case its my decision to make and
Ive already made it

STEIN
In a way its a compliment then
isnt it Colonel

COL TALL
Theres no point in making a
scandal I dont want it in the
records of the battalion while I
commanded it and theres no point
in your having it put down against
you on your records This has
nothing to do with cowardice or
inefficiency

Generals Corps in Washington for

STEIN
No sir

COL TALL
Doesnt matter really I can fix
that Anyway you probably will
have it Also Im recommending you
for the Silver Star I will
recommend it in such a way that it
will definitely not be refused

Stein feels an instinctive angry desire to protest the
medal and half-raises his hand But then he lets it drop

COL TALL
You might as well have the Purple
Heart too

STEIN
Why

COL TALL
For one thing I notice a pretty
deep scratch on your left cheek
from hitting those rocks back there
yesterday If thats not enough I
also note a couple of blood streaks
from scratches on your hands
underneath all that mud

He stares at Stein expressionless Stein suddenly wants to

weep

STEIN
Aye aye sir

COL TALL
I think its best if you go back
right away with the next batch of
wounded and prisoners Its no good
for you to keep hanging around The
quieter we keep this the better it
will be for all

STEIN
Aye sir

He salutes and turns away

A group of stretcher-bearers is descending down to where the
jeeps are finally making their way up the forward slope of

Hill 210 and Stein joins them helping with the stretchers
No one in C-for-Charlie has seen him leave

But the word gets around quickly
keep it quiet all of C-for-Charlie -- and for that
the entire battalion -- knows within fifteen minutes
Stein has been relieved Many of the men and noncoms

angry

DOLL
We got to make a protest

BECKER

Who to The Colonel Hell throw us
in the can for even thinking such a

thing

In spite of Talls

wish to

that

are very

In the end it all tapers away to nothing but bitter mumble
But if the others are willing to assuage their consciences
this way Witt does not feel he can let it go at that

WITT

Whats the matter with you This
battalion is going to hell ona
sled Band For comp’ny commander
I believe I know how to rekinize a
comp’ny commander He aint one
Neither was Stein He just become
one in the past two days and look
whats happened Theyre kicking
him out Well I dont wanta be in

this battalion no more Not without

the Cap’n Not as long as Shorty
Tall’s in command

Witt paces off in a mood of supreme disgusted fury A cold
implacable Kentuckyness has come over him This business with

the Captain has put a cap on things

EXT COMPANY CP —- DAY

Pulling his sharp chin down into his thin neck and setting
his narrow shoulders stolidly he reports himself to the new

company commander at the CP shortly before dusk

TRAIN

What are you doing here Witt

WITT
Minding my binness

That goddamned Welsh is there of course Band is sitting six
feet away from him eating the last of a can of C-ration

WITT
(to Welsh)
Private Witt requests permission to
speak to the comp’ny commander

Witt does not let his eyes waver from the Sergeant Welsh
stares at him grimly Then he turns his head

WELSH
Sir Private Witt requests
permission to speak to the company
commander

LT BAND

Okay Sit down Witt sit down
Make yourself com-fort-able But
youre not Private any more
youre “Acting Sergeant” Witt I
heard Captain Stein made you one
this morning You seen my helmet
Witt

WITT
No sir

Band bends and picks up the helmet He sticks his finger
through the hole and waggles it at Witt

LT BAND
Thats something isnt it hunh
Shot it right off my head

WITT
Yes sir

LT BAND
I never knew these things ever
really protected anybody Im going
to keep this the shell anyway --
take it home with me But sit down
Witt sit down

WITT
I prefer to stand sir

LT BAND
(his eager smile
vanishing)
Oh All right Witt What was it
you wanted Witt

WITT
Sir I want to tell the Compny
Commander that Im returning to my
old outfit Cannon Compny The
reason I wanted to tell the Compny
Commander was so that if the
Compny Commander noticed I wasnt
around hed know why

LT BAND
Well that isnt necessary Witt I
think we can arrange to have you
transferred Dont worry about
being AWOL Youve been a pretty
valuable man the last couple of
days

WITT
Yes sir

LT BAND
You know were short of noncoms
Tomorrow I intend to make all the
temporary ranks permanent

A bribe Witt can smell Welsh watching with supreme disgust
Bands eyes suddenly narrow above his still-smiling mouth

LT BAND
You still want to go All right
Witt I guess theres really no way
I can stop you officially Anyway
I wouldnt want a man in my command
who didnt want to serve under me

WITT

Its not that sir

(it is a lie at least

partly)
Its that I dont want to serve in
a battalion -- that does to guys
what this battalion did to Captain
Stein

He deliberately does not mention Colonel Tall Band studies
him

LT BAND
Okay Witt But I feel thats not
up to us to judge Every army is
bigger than any single man in it
WITT
Yes sir

LT BAND

Thats all Witt Oh Witt
(as Witt turns back)

Perhaps youd like a letter to
present to your company commander
in Cannon Company attesting to
where youve been the past two
days If you would Id be glad to
write one for you

WITT
(impassively)
Thank you sir

LT BAND
Sergeant write a letter saying To
Whom It May Concern that Witt has
been with this organization the
past two days in the thick of the
fighting and has been recommended
for decorations

WELSH
I hadnt got a typewriter

LT BAND
Dont argue with me Sergeant
Write the letter Take this sheet
of paper and write the letter

WELSH
Aye sir Weld Take this paper and
go over to that stump and write me
a letter You got a pen

WELD
Yes sir

WELSH
You heard what to put in the
letter

WELD
Yes sir

WELSH
Okay Move And dont call me
sir fuckface

Welsh sits down and folds his arms and looks at both of them
Witt and Band Then suddenly he grins his crazy mad furry-
eyed grin at both of them Somewhere in that labyrinthine
mind of his he is obviously lumping them together and
letting them know it

When the letter is written and signed -- it takes only a few
moments -- Welsh hands it over But when Witt takes hold of
it Welsh suddenly clamps his thumb and forefinger together
not letting it go When Witt exerts some pressure Welsh
holds on grinning that stupid insane grin down into his
face But when Witt lets go and is just dropping his arm
Welsh lets go too and the paper almost falls to the ground
Witt has to catch it

LT BAND
Theres no need to go now Witt
Its practically dark You can wait
till tomorrow

WITT
I aint afraid of the dark
Lootenant

Witt stares hard at Welsh then he leaves He is angry at
himself for wanting the letter He should of left it or
refused it in the first place He didnt really need it
Screw them all the cheap bastards Not a one of them has
lifted a finger to help poor old Stein And if Band thinks he
can buy off Bob Witt with a sergeancy or an offer to stay
overnight and maybe reconsider he doesnt know his guy He
wads the letter up and throws it away

EXT COMPANY CP —- DAY
Band has sent Weld away and is alone with Welsh

LT BAND
Sergeant I cant help noting a
tone of subtle ridicule in
everything you say For some time
Ive felt youre not always
properly respectful to the company
officers

WELSH
Sir you can have my stripes and my
job whenever you want them

He means it and Band knows he means it

LT BAND
Sergeant dont ever get the idea
youre indispensable

WELSH
Lieutenant nobody knows better
than me exactly how dispensable
every man in this outfit is

Band feels himself outmaneuvered and decides not to push it
further

EXT COMPANY CP —- DAY

Bell and some of the other men plead with Witt Fife does not
plead but sitting apart stares evenly at him Witt will
have to be the first one to speak and he chooses not to

BELL
Why dont you just stay You know
youd like to If they get hold of
you back in the rear theyll throw
you in the stockade

WITT
Not me I wont never come back
in this battalion long as Shorty
Tall commands it No sir Muchs I
might like to That Shorty Tall
better stay away from me or Ill
punch his head in

BELL
(as Witt walks off)
You cant go back there tonight
anyway You fool Youll get your
ass shot off by some trigger-happy
sentry Hardhead

EXT COMPANY CP —- DUSK

Sgt Welsh stands in front of a portion of the company
reading an announcement from Col Tall

WELSH
This is from Colonel Tall Our
victory gives us the highest
reasons for pride It will prove a
milestone in the battle for
Guadalcanal

(MORE)

We have susadandiktartte highest
casualties in the division and have
captured the toughest objective
Tomorrow the division commander
will arrive to make a personal
inspection of the line After the
inspection we are to be relieved by
a battalion of the divisions
reserve regiment I have secured
for the battalion a weeks rest off
the line

Tall stands off from his CP by himself listening in the
gathering dusk He smiles to himself as he hears the distant
cheers He flatters himself that he knows pretty well how
enlisted men work -- he ought to after fifteen years -- and
the news of the weeks relief far more than offsets any
natural irritation over the inspection

EXT HILLSIDE - DUSK

Witt is descending the hillside in lonely bewilderment when
he meets Ash the wounded 3rd Platoon scout who grins at him
from the side of the trail

ASH
Id of had you Kaintuck if you
was a Jap -- long ago

WITT

They leave you here

ASH
I would of slowed them up I dont
really mind Medic fixed me up
before they left I got plenty of
ammo and Welsh left me his pistol
They1l be somebody along for me
evenshully

He seems about three-fourths drunk from shock morphine and
the pain of his bandaged wound which he displays for Witt

ASH
Right in the knee Im out of this
war for good Witt But what the
hellre you doin down here

WITT
Some binness

He looks around marvelling to find the terrain where they
lay so long in fear and trembling now so peaceful the pure
sky breathing on the land the earth going her tranquil way

ASH
Well give all them boys my best

WITT
You can come with me if you want
Ill help you along

ASH
Nah its nice and quiet and
peaceful here Anyway Id slow you
up Somebody’1ll be along for me

WITT
Ill remind them

ASH
Okay

Ash watches the dusk close around the vanishing figure of the
proud Kentuckian

FADE TO

EXT DOWN FROM HILLS (DRUMSARA BIVOUAC) —- DAY

They come down from the hills and out of the jungle with

their haunted faces and pool-deep sea-dark eyes lugging
every ounce of booty they can carry and looking more like
Bowery scavengers than soldiers

No sooner are they at their bivouac in a coconut grove by the
sea than they begin getting blind crazy drunk It is a wild
mass bacchanalian orgy that will go on for days

VOICES
Freedom We won We whipped their
ass Hooooeee

They are hardly down out of the trucks before the bottles
left behind here by various men and catalogued carefully by
Storm are out and being utilized MacTae the supply
sergeant in an excess of guilty love has pitched all of the
companys pyramidal tents and even set up the cots in them
complete with their blankets and mosquito bars The kitchen
fly is up and the stoves are lighted All the weary warriors
have to do is clamber down and start drinking seriously as
soon as they can draw their marked bottles from Storms
locked chests

BECKER
Avoid the sea Theres sharks out
there In these islands they
worship the shark

Bell sits alone while the others carouse hunched over a
sheet of paper with a carpenters pencil writing a letter to
his wife (Much of his letter may play against scenes of
Marty back in the States in Florida or perhaps in Hawaii
He remembers the first time they saw each other their first
touch or first kiss)

BELL (VO)

Youre everything thats soft and
tender Marty I love you You have
no edges Youre like the snow
that comes down and makes
everything pure and bright and
clean Everything dies on this
island but everywhere you go they
live

A soldier with a fiddle plays Midnight on the Water The
cooks toss grenades into a stream and collect the fish that
bob to the surface Storm then creates for the company such a
fish fry that it makes the more fragile-minded weep for home
All of them are a bit mad The combat numbness with its
starry eyes drawn faces and thousand-yard stare has not yet
left them Those who did not have the foresight to stock
whiskey away drink Aqua Velva mixed with canned grapefruit
juice from the kitchen supply

By nightfall almost everybody has vomited one or more times
Several men get down on their hands and knees in the
moonlight shining tranquilly down into the coconut groves
and bay at the moon like wolves or hounds Another group of
ten or twelve take off all their clothing and bareass nude
run tripping and dancing across the open field beside the
bivouac to swim in the Matanikau in the moonlight And there
are at least nine fist fights When the KLAXONS sound later
on several men stumble into the wrong slit trenches while
one actually dives into a latrine

BELL (VO)
You spread life and peace around
you You come like the rain to
everything thats dry inside me and
like a starved root Youre the sky
and the clouds youre what there
is beyond all this You make my
blood sing Marty I dont see how
anything could keep me from you I
go through the earth to you

(MORE )

I touch yoBEisinentasd long as
youre with me theres nothing Im
afraid of

INT MAZZIS TENT - DUSK
Inside Mazzis tent everybody is busy knocking Lt Band

KIRK
Fucking stupid fuck of a
lieutenant Volunteered us Taking
chances with us Fucking with us
You tellin me he wasnt glad when
they relieved the Captain He could
hardly keep from smiling His mouth
was doin like a worm

MAZZI
So tell him What the fucks the
good of sittin around here yackin
about it

Carni slack-faced with malarial fever and the leader of the
little Greater New York group of hep guys looks over at him
and asks in a voice hollow with fever and cynicism

CARNI
Why the hell dont you do it
yourself then

TASSI
Yeah why dont yah

KIRK
Yeah why not Alls you got to
lose is that P-F-C you might get on
the next promotions list

MAZZI
(getting up drunkenly)
All right by God I will

He marches out of the tent and staggers through the coco
palms toward Bands HQ tent The others follow him at a
distance sniggering happily content to let him take the
dangerous chance alone All that is except Carni who
cannot get out of his bed

EXT BANDS HQ TENT - DUSK

Despair hatred and unredeemable misery rage in Mazzis heart
after the humiliation of his rescue by Tills

It had to be that fucking Tills So far Tills has not told
anybody but he might

DOLL
(intercepting him)
You hated the Captain till they
sent him away You said he didnt
know what he was doing

MAZZI
Fuck you

DOLL
Whatre you going to Band for You
wanta tell somebody off why dont
you find the Colonel

KIRK
Watch out Frankie You could get
in trouble

MAZZI
Fuck it I dont care one way or
the other I dont fucking care
Worse it is the better

(toward the tent)

Come out you son of a bitch I
said came out shiteater Come out
and find out what the men in your
outfit think of you Band You want
to know what we think of you Glory
hunter Come on volunteer us for
somethin else

From Bands blacked-out tent just the faintest hint of light
creeps out to the waiting men outside Inside the tent
nothing seems to move Other men have begun to gather around
too now their grinning teeth white in the bright moonlight
Aware of them Mazzi rages on marching back and forth and
swinging his skinny arms compounding insult and profanity
with great artistry

MAZZI
Youre a prick Band A schmuck
Cmon out Ill take you myself
Everybody in this outfit hates your
guts Did you know that How does
it feel How does it feel

Finally the light in the tent goes out Then the flap is
thrown back and Band stands in the doorway leaning on his
hand on the canvas He sways ever so slightly but says
nothing Slowly the men begin to drift away awkwardly The
fun is gone

MAZZI
You think that fucking hero helmet
means anything longside the good
dead men that are really dead

KIRK
Lets git back to some ser-yous
drinkin Come on Frankie

MAZZI
And thats what we think of you So
court-martial me

He stalks off proudly Band feels sick To think he loved
them all like children Mazzis tight little Greater New York
clan congratulates him all the way back to the tents
crowding around him to slap his back and shake his hand Now
that Bands silent face is no longer before them the fun has

come back

MAZZI
I sure got him told I sure got him
told And he never said one word
back

Then suddenly he sees Tillss mocking lip-lifting face
square in front of him and is startled into a new hollow
apathy He tries to brave it out chuckling hollowly to his
new satellite Carni

MAZZI
I sure got him told

CARNI
You sure did

Tills spits brown out of the side of his grin

TILLS
You never got nobody tole nothin
Nothin a tall I know

MAZZI
Dont you tell no lies Tills

TILLS
Lies Im only going to tell what I
know When I feel like it exactly
to the minute Thats the way it s
gonna be

Tills smiles crookedly Mazzi turns away in horror

INT WELSHS TENT - DUSK
Welsh and Storm are drinking too but they appear cold sober

STORM

Dont matter how much training
youve got how careful you are
its a matter of luck whether or
not you get killed It dont make
no difference who you are how
tough a guy you might be how much
you know -- if you re in the wrong
spot at the wrong time youre
going to get it

(heavily)
I dont care no more I dont care
about nothing First time I ever
felt this way

He finds it very serious almost a tragedy Welshs reaction
astonishes him

WELSH

Sounds like bliss

(after a moment)
I dont really feel it yet The
numbness Not like the rest of you
do Maybe I just knew what to
expect Maybe I was frozen up
already I know its the only thing
that saves you

(with his sly-eyed grin)
Maybe if you work on it you can
make it a permanent state Im
going to try

Storm looks up like a sleepy bait-wise sea turtle

STORM
Not me

WELSH
I like all this shit Storm I like
being shot at Guess Ill just go
till I drop in my tracks or some
Jap gets me They can bury me while
I laugh

Welsh watches the insects crashing mindlessly against the
lantern that hangs from the centerpole He starts to get up
and keels over on his face

EXT BIVOUAC - NIGHT

Somewhere in the midst of this great bacchanalian orgy Dol’
Fife and a few other men have stumbled into Queen Queen is
raving -- drunk miserable and alone

QUEEN
I shouldnt ought to have knocked
those boys heads together Did you
see how the Colonel looked at me
Did you see Maybe those boys
wasn’t the ones personally that
did the ball-cuttin Whatll I do
now Maybe they didnt know nothing
about it Maybe they was against
it Forgive me

DOLL
He was eatin’ mud before He ate a
peck of dirt Hes gone

Queen throws himself down in the mud and begins to weep
whimper and howl biting his clenched knuckles and staring at
Doll and Fife with the wild eyes of a rabid animal raving
half in incomprehensible gibberish half in lucid phrases

OTHER MEN (0S)
Give him air Dont get close to
him Let him breathe Dont shine
that light in his eyes

QUEEN
Forgive me I done what I shouldnt
ought to have done Some things you
cant take back Help Get away
from me I dont belong with you

He weeps and whimpers and goes on biting his knuckles
writhing as though in an epileptic fit Looking in his eyes
Fife feels more than yesterday in combat the horror of war
its power to poison the soul its systematic reduction of men
to animals

QUEEN
Forgive me

OTHER MEN (0S)
Let him go Stand back What the
fuck kind of swipe was he drinkin’

INT DIVISION HOSPITAL — DUSK

Welsh comes to find himself in a small section of the
division hospital reserved for first three graders Storm has
come to visit him and is smoking a cigar The colored ticket
for evacuation is already attached to the foot of his bed

WELSH
So it was you that got me hauled up
here

His crazy eyes glint with an insane feverishness Storm
cannot tell whether it is the malaria or simply Welshs
personality

STORM
Knock off First Sarnt Just be
quiet and theyre going to ship you
out of here You got malaria
Youre bein evacuated

WELSH
Youll never get away with it
Youll never beat me out of my job
Storm Im too smart Anyway you
may be okay in the kitchen --
you’ve got no head for
administration I know you

From down the aisle the frail young 2ND LT DOCTOR who runs
the ward comes running with a wardboy

2ND LT DOCTOR
Now you just take it easy
Sergeant Youve got a temperature
of a hundred and five and two-
tenths

WELSH
Youre in cahoots with him

For answer the Lieutenant shoves him back on his pillow and
puts a thermometer in his mouth at which point Welsh bites
the thermometer in two throws it on the floor leaps out of
bed and runs out the tent flap and back to his company

EXT AIRFIELD (SOUVENIR MARKET) —- DAY

In the morning the whole of C-for-Charlie descends en masse
to the airfield spreads out over the undamaged or least-
damaged areas of it and begins bargaining with the Air
Corps trading souvenirs for the Scotch that the flyers bring
in each day from Australia with the generals supplies the
milk meat and cheese

It is like a vast Arab souk a thieves market and the
bidding is fierce A silk battle flag preferably
bloodstained is worth at least three Imperial quarts A
Samurai saber is always worth five Money is practically
meaningless to everyone except the airmen

BELL (VO)

(with MUSIC)
The world seems crazy without you
Away from you the world is unreal
like a country youre leaving
forever and never coming back to

(after a pause)
I look up in the leaves I listen
to the crickets I feel like
anything could be a sign from you
When Im with other people I feel
homesick for the mountain air Ive
breathed with you Loving you keeps
me pure

(after a pause)
Were like two trees that have
grown together -- like ivy ona
wall Nothing means anything
without you

(after a pause)
Will peace ever come I want to
stay changeless for you Marty You
get something twisted out of your
insides by all this filth and blood
and noise Keep me through this
terror Marty Keep me through the
madness Keep me through the blood
Darling hold me close tonight I
love you

EXT DUSTY ROAD NEAR THE AIRFIELD - DAY
Drifting away bored Fife sees Storm and Doll Queen and a

few other men tramping down the dusty road toward Rear
Echelon HQ

FIFE
Where you going

DOLL
We heard Captain Steins around
here somewhere waiting to be
shipped out

Fife decides to join them Together they set out to pay their
respects to their company commander whom they once hated but
now admire and to tell him goodbye

INT STEINS TENT - DAY

They find Stein at work in his tent sorting what few papers
he has Their arrival takes him by surprise

FIFE
Hello Captain When you leavin

STEIN
Tomorrow Im going to New Zealand
by plane

DOLL

Howd you find your bags We
looked we couldnt find ours

STEIN
I spent the last three days hunting
them down They gave me the use of
a jeep I enjoyed driving around

DOLL
You ready to go

Doll seems to have taken it upon himself to speak for the
others

STEIN
Whenever they tell me I would
have come to visit you but I felt
like being alone

He takes a bottle off the little camp table and offers them
all a drink There is only one glass in the tent so they all
take it straight from the neck of the bottle When Stein sees
how appreciative they are he reaches into his bags and hauls
out the three bottles he intended to take with him on the
plane and gives them to them Under the influence of the
liquor they soon are all talking at once all babbling away
together Stein feels curiously detached

DOLL
We want to thank you sir for
asking to make that flankin move
and watching out for us -- for
keeping us together Were sorry to
see you go We feel like you got a
rotten deal

STEIN
Im not sure youre right You
never know if youre doing any
good Thats the hard part It
doesnt matter I dont care Im
glad to be going

FIFE
Theres still time we ought to all
go and make a protest --

STEIN
What for What good would it do
Anyway I want to go You wouldnt
want to take away my chances of
getting evacuated would you

No they chant in unison For Gods sake they wouldnt
want to do that

STEIN
Leave it alone Let it lay

Why should he want to stay Everyone is dying to get out It
is the only sane thing to want And yet he knows there is
something he found here that he will never find back there
He knows it and they know it though none of them could say
what it is

STEIN
Why should I care Washingtons
full of women Its the big boom
town now With my campaign ribbons
and medals I ought to make out
pretty well I could do worse

Stein exchanges with Storm -- a look of secret knowledge
Storm like him means to be one of those who lives if he
possibly can And Storm like him does not feel at all
guilty

EXT STEINS TENT - DAY

When they have left Stein stands in the door of the tent and
watches them straggle off with their whiskey unshaven
dirty still in the mud-slicked fatigues from the battle

Later when the planes come over he sits quietly in the
dark without any fear and listens to the BOMBINGS

EXT BIVOUAC - DAY

At the bivouac the drinking starts before breakfast They
crawl out of their net-covered cots and have a good stiff
dolt of Australian Scotch Breakfast is the only roll call of
the day by order of Shorty Tall after that they are on their
own

EXT BIVOUAC (MAIL CALL) —- DAY

The men crowd wildly around Corporal Weld as he passes out
the mail Those who have reason to fear their names might not
be called linger back in the shade of the palms where they
do not risk embarrassment or awkward questions Fife
considers Bell a lucky man

FIFE
Six letters

BELL
That doesnt seem like so many
Shes got plenty of time to write

Fife is feeling pretty cocky as the whiskey quietly grows
inside his splintered nerves He has found out that he is
really much braver than he thought and this gives him real
boy It isnt so hard to be a real soldier after all

With Jenks dead Corporal Fife has become Sergeant Fife
leader of the 2nd Squad 3rd Platoon He has saved at least
two of them once apiece and at least three of them have saved
him He feels a fierce protective love for each and every one
of them But there is one thing that still rankles him and
that is the way that fucking son of a backbiting bitch Joe
Weld treated him in front of Welsh that day Stealing his job
like a sneak thief Then smiling at him that way

EXT HQ TENT - DAY

Joe Weld and Eddie Train the stutterer whose lap Fife landed
in in terror and the new kid Crown are sitting out drinking
with two of the cooks when Fife saunters up to them mouth
pursed tongue rubbing slowly over his teeth his arms
dangling

WELD
Oh -- uh hello there Fife We
were just --

FIFE

Sergeant Fife to you Corporal And
dont ever call me anything else

Weld looks startled for a moment Then his look of startle
turns into a placating smile

WELD
Well I guess you really earned the
title Sergeant The hard way I
for one sure dont --

FIFE
Dont ass-kiss me you cheap fuck

WELD
Now Now see here
(scrambling to his feet)
I never done

He does not get to finish because Fife steps in and knocks
him down without a word -- without a sound in fact except
for the smack of his fist on the cheekbone

WELD
Hey Hey I was just sitting here
drinking and talking and minding my
own business

FIFE
Get up cheap fuck Get up job
stealer Get up and Ill knock you
down again

First nearby then further off he hears uncaringly the happy
cries of Fight Fight and the SOUND of mens feet running

WELD
I dont want to fight you I didnt
steal your job

(MORE)

It was WelSELA(comidel me corporal

Nobody knew you was coming back I

don’t want to fight you Fife
(repeating it slyly)

I just want --

He doesnt finish Instead he makes a wild lunging leap for
Fifes middle to grapple It doesnt succeed Joyously Fife
steps in again and left-hooks him This time it is more
accurate and on the jaw It sends Weld rolling away wildly
to the ground where he props himself on his elbows shaking
his head When he rolls over to sit up Fife dives on him

It is as though a sudden scrambled lightning bolt of happy
maleness and joyous masculinity has g lit Fifes skull
blinding him with glory On top of the groggy Weld on the
ground he cuffs and pummels Growling and cursing high in
his throat and crying Job stealer over and over he
punches with both fists and total abandon at the face below
him Finally they pull him off of him

FIFE
Lemme go

Somebody helps Weld up His nose is broken and bleeding Both
eyes are puffed almost shut

Blood runs from his mouth between his broken lips and he
looks bewildered

Fife standing unheld now and in command of himself again
though breathing hard stares at him feeling both happiness
and consternation at the destruction he has caused He is
proud of himself but he hasnt really meant to hurt anyone
Train and Crown take the swaying Weld by the arms to lead him
away

FIFE
Hey Hey Dont do that Dont go
Lets have a drink No hard
feelings

Fife marvels at how frail and hollow he seems this man who
once stirred such a sinking fear in him From ten yards away
Weld stops and looks back at him He is weeping and at the
same time trying not to He seems to be searching his fuddled
head for the very worst thing he can think of to call Fife

WELD
You -- You clerk

FIFE
Okay Be a jerk
(turning to the two cooks)
Either of you guys want some

He grins at them Both of them though they are bigger than
Fife shake their heads in silence Fife walks along rubbing
his bruised hands Around them the men are beginning to
disperse now that it is over

DOLL
Did you hear that He called you a
clerk What he is You showed the
fucker

FIFE
Leave me alone

Fifes eyes flash with anger he does not wish to be
congratulated Doll does not take offense but with a
delicate nod lets the subject drop He sees Fife is limping

DOLL
Whats the matter

Just then a MESSENGER comes up from Rear Echelon gasping for
breath

MESSENGER
Col Talls been promoted Theyre
shipping him out Gaff and Lt Band
too The whole lot of them Were
going back up

EXT PALM GROVE - DAY

Down in the palm grove Col Tall talks with a small group of
newsmen He has somehow come into possession of a jewel-
encrusted Samurai sword and carries it under his arm in place
of the baton Captain Gaff and Lt Band are with him each
with his personal baggage A jeep waits nearby and a movie
camera records the scene

COL TALL
(smiling broadly)
Of course Im glad of the
promotion But it will be painful
to leave these men I feel theyre
in good hands though Theyve been
bloodied Theyve tasted victory

A group of C-for-Charlie men watch from a distance While
they are fond of Captain Gaff his departure to glory -- word
is out he will be put up for the Medal of Honor -- leaves
them with a certain bitterness

As for Old Shorty who after all is being promoted because
of their shed blood nobody really cares very much that he is
leaving They arent even watching as he is driven off

EXT JUNGLE ROAD (A MONTH LATER) —- DAY

The scene shifts to the jungle again A solitary figure humps
along under his combat pack with slung rifle and bandoliers
thin and frail-looking his head sunk deep into his helmet
shell Storm from his stove sees the single figure coming
up the road

EXT STORMS MESS TENT - DAY

Storm shakes Witts hand fervently From beneath the helmet

in shadow Witts hard implacable eyes peer out like the eyes
of some ferret-like animal They have not seen each other in

over a month

STORM
Let me give you some food You look
hungry Witt

Storm serves him all the fried Spam dehydrated mashed
potatoes and stewed dehydrated apples his small belly can
hold Then he breaks out an Imperial quart

STORM
Howd you find us What the hell
are you doing up here Like this
All by yourself

WITT
Im headin back to the compny

He wipes his mouth with the back of his hand

STORM
Youre what

WITT
(with a grin)
Going back Shorty Tall got
promoted

STORM
You must be out of your mind

Witts eyes turn slowly in their sockets to stare at him

WITT
No I aint

STORM
In the first place nobody knows
where they are Theyre way to hell
and gone off on their own
someplace

WITT
I can find them Somebodys got to
know

STORM
You must be off your rocker

WITT
Why Its the compny aint it
Tails promoted aint he

He looks straight at Storm out of his black Kentucky eyes

STORM
Have a nuther drink

WITT
Thank you I will Its good to see
you Stormy What are you doin’ up
here feeding all these strangers

STORM
I tried to catch up to the compny
but we missed them Couldnt go any

further -- and these guys was here
I figured I might as well feed
somebody

WITT

Well I guess its a good deed It
was good for me anyway I been
hiking three days

Storm looks around the ridge and shrugs again
STORM

Angh for two cents Id go with
you

WITT
Come on along

STORM
I dont know what these dumbasses
would do if they didnt have me
around to take care of them

WITT
Wed have some fun

STORM
The truth is I dont like to get
shot at

WITT

Ever body to his own taste I thin
I like it But honestly I wouldnt
be doin’ this if it wasnt the old
comp’ny

Storm looks at him skeptically but lets it pass and Witt
sets out again well aware of the effect his odyssey is
creating

NEW ANGLES

Witt shakes Storms hand a final time He has lingered to
have a couple more drinks

WITT

Were going to find out after this
war is over what we fought for if
it was for freedom or sos a bunch
of people could get rich and ruin
the country and never call things
by their rightful names Yessir

(taking Storm by the

shoulder)
Like my Aunt Kay says the fat hogs
have got loose in the creek and
tromped everything up Thats
whats happened

(spitting)
We worked to build this country
They stole what we built and messed
up what was there to begin with
belonged to everybody The big
companies have got control of our
work our pay our bank deposits
our public lands and our govment
Theyve dug holes

(MORE )

Were dumb Wg Tigenmindins American
democracys been bombed Were
living in the ruins Them that
comes after is going to have to be
content with what we spoiled

(his voice grows thick)
You ever had a garden Theyre
pulling up the young plants and
watering the weeds People dont
see whats happening They got ways
of keeping it secret But I seen
it easy as falling off a log They
dont fool me No sir I paid the
price and I seen the show

Who is closer to the truth -- Welsh with his disillusioned
view of things (which Storm and in varying degrees the rest
of the company share) or Witt with his idealism

STORM
They fooled you plenty Whatre you
going up there for I can see doing
it because they make you But ready
and willing

Witt is not sure what Storm is driving at or why suddenly he
has taken this new tone A moment ago they were the best of
friends

STORM
Company dont care about you
Companys just a shell A hotel
People come and go You going to
get shot at for a hotel After
youre gone theyre going to have
other guests You dont owe them
nothin’ You believe in somethin
that dont believe in you

Witt wonders if Storm is insulting him He brought it on him-
self though didnt he He wont make the same mistake
again

WITT
I made a mistake getting into this
discussion

He gives Storm back his jar of liquor turns and walks off

STORM
Boy theyre just playing you like
a fiddle in a band Youre just the
kind they like to get
(as Witt continues on)
(MORE)

They dont SPORM(castitd pbout you
Dont even know that you exist
Theyre going to eat you up and
have you for dinner

(shouting after him)
Jackass Briar And fuck your Aunt
Kay

WITT
were himself spitting)
Cook

Witt goes off in solitary splendor toward the line Storm
watches until he disappears from sight then kissing his
wounded hand and laughing with delight he does a little jig
A long column of troops winds through the grassy field ahead
of Witt Trucks jeeps a tank He catches a ride on a truck

EXT JUNGLE (MOWBRAYGUADALCANAL )- DAY

Witt is walking down a road through the jungle humming to

himself when he hears the SNAP of a spent bullet in leaves
overhead He stops and looks up There is the faint angry

WHIRR of a second bullet He looks up and down He is quite
alone here exposed and vulnerable

EXT JUNGLE (OTHER ANGLES) - DAY

He sees a group of flying foxes stirring uneasily in their
roost He sees a stranger fig choking the life out of a tall
hardwood The grass about him throbs with CRICKETS He feels
the cold presence of fear like someone standing behind him
He could still turn back His eyes glisten Now MUSIC comes
in like a call of summoning love

Further up the road he encounters a Marine SNIPER

EXT COPRA PLANTATION —- DAY

C-for-Charlie is camped by an abandoned copra plantation A

sentry hears a rock HUM past him and startled FIRES off a

couple of wild rounds He stops when he hears himself hailed
form the jungle in a strong Kentucky accent

WITT
Charlie Compny Charlie Compny
Hold yore fahr Its Witt
(with sly humor)
Acting P-F-C Witt Of Cannon
Comp ny

Fife looks up Other heads snap around They see it is indeed
Witt He has trekked all the way up to the line to find them
There is a great deal of backslapping laughter and
handshaking Everybody is overjoyed to see him to know that
he would search them out like this just to be with them They
show him their new mascot a cuscus

Welsh and Witt have a conversation here

EXT PLANTATION VERANDA —- DAY

Fife goes up to Witt and smiles Squinting his eyes and
putting his head a little to one side and grinning he says

FIFE
Hello Witt Or are you still not
speakin’ to me

Witt grins back He seems to sense some change he likes They
are alone on the plantations dusty veranda Chairs and
tables surround them with other vestiges of some domestic
life before the war a home destroyed

WITT
No I guess Im talking to you now

FIFE
Because if youre not I thought we
might as well have it out right
here and now

Fife grins Witt nods still grinning Apparently he has
heard about Fifes new fighting prowess

WITT
Well we could do that I still
think I could take you But you got
a pretty good right hand from what
I hear If you tagged me with that
right hand you might could whup
me Awys pervaded I couldnt keep
away from it a course

FIFE
There aint really no need though --
(grinning)
-- now Since youre talking to me
Is there

WITT
Not really

FIFE
What do you say we have a slug of
swipe instead

They laugh and shake hands friends again Fifes eyes sting
with tears of gratitude

WITT
Been a long time since we had a
talk -- hadnt it Whats the new

commander like

EXT COPRA PLANTATION —- DAY

Witt looks at the other men in the same ecstasy of loving
comradeship that he felt for Capt Stein the afternoon of
their assault on the Japanese bivouac The CAMERA FOLLOWING
his gaze lingers on them admiring them one by one Little
do they suspect how they are gathered in the Kentuckians
heart -- even Welsh who stares at him in a mixture of
amusement and scorn

He listens as a young NEWCOMER dictates a letter to a friend

NEWCOMER
She dont know I cant write but
she knows I cant write good so
throw in some mistakes

DISSOLVE TO

EXT KENTUCKY FARMS AND FIELDS —- DAY

Witt in what must be vision sees the farms and valleys of
Kentucky -- people are going about their work raking hay and
putting it up in barns -- a land of peace and truth bright
with an unearthly light

A woman appears Gracious noble she looks out on those
scenes a smile on her lips She might be some individual
whom Witt has known his sister or mother She is all that is
not strife or war or senseless death She is peace she is
hope

SHARP CUT TO

EXT COPRA PLANTATION - DAY

A Japanese mortar BURSTS overhead Fife quakes with horror

VOICE
Not my legs Not my legs

DOLL
Check your ammo

C-for-Charlie cringes under a fierce counterattack The
Japanese heavy mortars are lobbing in treebursts and there
is nowhere to hide From time to time a man rises up to draw
a piece of coconut tree from his flesh the fragments are
thrown down from above with the force of the shrapnel itself
and finally do more damage

Animals rush through the trees and across the tangled bungle
floor as though fleeing a fire Cockatoos lorikeets The
afternoon air sparkles with shredded vegetation This new
battle is fiercer more horrible and confused than the first
(To convey the mens heightened sense of fear we shift for a
brief while from 35mm to 65mm film stock)

EXT COPRA PLANTATION —- DAY

Fife claws the ground All the confidence has gone out of
him he is right back where he started It takes every ounce
of courage he can muster not to break and run just to stick
it out He can do it and he does but it costs him more than
it does the others like Doll or Bell He has to work harder
at it It seems he isnt what he thought he was Courage will
never be a possession with him

Doll orders his squad around The inexperienced men flinch
and gasp at each BURST from the mortars

DOLL
We clot it and its here There
ain’t a fucking thing we can do
about it Lock and load

Fife watches him amazed Since his experience at the bunker
a new sense of paternal responsibility has blossomed in Doll

EXT COPRA PLANTATION —- DAY

The companys sparrow-mouthed long-nosed NEW LIEUTENANT
gives the phone back to Corporal Weld Neither he nor anyone
else seems to have the least idea where the enemy is or what
is going or Half a dozen men from another unit flee past
them some without their helmets They say nothing to C-for-
Charlie -- merely glance at them with great white eyes and
pass on

NEW LIEUTENANT
Somebody -- the commander says
somebody needs to go up there --

Beyond the plantation a red clay road runs straight off
through the jungle One or two men crane their heads to look
up it

NEW LIEUTENANT
(wondering if they heard
him)
Somebody needs to go forward and
find out how close they are We
need to block that road Till they
can send more people up

BELL
We need to get out of here sir
Right now Did you explain the
situation to him Does he know
where we are Were sittin’ ducks
out here

The Lieutenant tries to get battalion HQ on the phone again
but now the line is dead

WELD
They cut the line

NEW LIEUTENANT
(very shaken)
Volunteers I need volunteers

The men look at each other Those who came forward before --
Doll Dale Queen Bell -- lie paralyzed today

Witt studies the deserted road ahead He knows that whoever
goes up there is likely never to come back

NEWCOMER (0OS)
Ill go

Witt turns A NEWCOMER has spoken up a green recruit like
Bead a stranger to them all Now Witt recognizes him as the
man he heard dictating the letter the night before MUSIC
enters

The stranger quakes all over astonished at himself Witt
frowns He turns and looks at the others His brothers Again
it comes to him the hotly joyous almost sexual enjoyment
and acceptance the joy of not caring anymore

WITT
Sir Ive had more experience than
that man

The others look in amazement as Witt crawls over to the
Lieutenant

NEW LIEUTENANT
I havent seen you around before

WITT
I want you to know I think the
whole things a bad idea though
If they come through there in any
strength Lootenant theyre going
to knock your roadblock to hell and
flinders even if we was a whole
platoon We couldnt hold them But
I want to go

The Lieutenant shares the other mens astonishment

NEW LIEUTENANT
You dont have to go private If
you dont want to Others will
volunteer

Besides the young stranger no one else has they all know
it And Witt can still get out

WITT
No -- I want to go sir If
somethin’ bad happens I want to be
there so maybe I can help Besides
nothin’ bad may happen at all

COOMBS
Ill go with Witt Lieutenant

Coombs looks at Witt as though he thought this way they might
have a chance to talk The long-nosed New Lieutenant nods

NEW LIEUTENANT
Youll need another man

He looks around Again there are no volunteers Fife has no
intention of sticking his neck out but when Witts glance
accidentally crosses his he suddenly speaks up

FIFE
Ill go

The words are out of his mouth before he knows it Witt
frowns (Cover Welsh’s reactions as well)

NEW LIEUTENANT
Be careful Witt

WITT
Yes sir

Witt gets his orders He listens then goes off with a
cheerful air that the other men find incomprehensible Coombs
follows then Fife None of them looks back

The young man who volunteered when he understands the look
in the other mens eyes is glad his offer was not accepted
and that he did not renew it however embarrassing his
failure to do so might be Nor does it trouble him that two
other men are going in his place

EXT DESERTED ROAD —- DAY
The three volunteers make their way forward

WITT
You never know when to keep your
mouth shut

Witt studies the road ahead from the position they have taken
up alongside it Fife trembles He wants to weep but he is
afraid to Everything is going so fast so far For a moment
nothing happens Then ominously the mortars fall silent
Fife feels it again -- the cold empty fear -- like a hollow
a void where his confidence once lay his pleasure in
himself It makes him feel sick And it stays with him

Witt looks around A NOISE in the undergrowth on their right
barely perceptible at first gradually grows more distinct

Coombs peers forward alarmed by a FAINT CRY Ignoring Fife
he looks at Witt only Witt says nothing

Coombs raises his head again The concussion of a late mortar
round sends him reeling

All at once fifty yards ahead of them they see a whole
battalion of Japanese soldiers materialize from the tree
line

Hundreds of fresh troops appear camouflaged with the
branches of trees and bushes -- nothing like the gaunt
starving poorly-equipped figures C-for-Charlie has
encountered prior to now The American soldiers look more
emaciated than the Japanese do

Witt sees they have no chance of getting back together Calm
and with a curious air of concentration he turns to Fife

WITT
Go back Tell them what we saw Say
theyre coming up right behind the
mortars Battalion strength

FIFE
Why me Lets both go

Witt thinks about it for a moment The Japanese advance
quickly silently this will be a surprise attack

WITT
Theres no time You go Tell that
new lieutenant to get everybody
back Tell him they got heavy
machine guns Tell him where hes
sittin’ right now theyll eat him
up Ill hold them off

Witt nods There is still the same odd cheerful air about
him Fife gives him a little salute and then he leaves

Coombs is dying and he knows it He turns to Witt

COOMBS
Geez I never felt like this before
at all What you guess it could be
from like this No bullets no
blood Just around my chest its so
hard to breathe Hold me would
you Let me look at you Till the
end Till its over

As Witt watches the Japanese approach he begins to hear the
same MUSIC which came to him on the road as he was headed up
to the line the same mysterious summons of fraternal
devotion This is the fulfillment he has prepared himself
for

EXT COPRA PLANTATION —- DAY

Fife runs like a desperate man breaking a way through the
branches with his rifle until he reaches the company

FIFE
Go back Get back Quick

EXT DESERTED ROAD —- DAY

Witt waits until the Japanese are practically on top of him
before he OPENS FIRE They are caught by surprise Clearly
they had not expected to meet resistance so soon A small
Japanese soldier with a 31 Caliber machine gun strapped to
his back advances toward him He cannot reach back and fire
the gun himself his job is merely to serve as a tripod for
it Seeing Witt he throws himself on the ground and digs in
like a badger Other Japanese soldiers dash forward to
squeeze the trigger One by one Witt shoots them down
quickly decisively with daring and skill Soon mortar
rounds begin to fall among the enemy soldiers He looks back
over his shoulder Perhaps Fife has reported their position
perhaps the Japanese will stop and hell get out of this

EXT COPRA PLANTATION —- DAY

Several hundred yards away the men of C-for-Charlie listen in
bewilderment as they pull back

MEN OF C-FOR-CHARLIE
Why dont he come back Wheres
Coombs I just hear one gun Whats
happening Why cant we go back
Why cant we help him

They glance at the new man whose life has been spared

WELD
The lines fixed sir

NEW LIEUTENANT
(shouting into the phone)
Fire mission Grid Five Mike One
Niner Enemy in the open Danger
close

Welsh is the last to fall back He looks in Witts direction
WELSH
Fool
EXT DESERTED ROAD - DAY

Witt darts up and down the Japanese line of advance FIRING
until he runs out of ammunition

While he is reloading a YOUNG JAPANESE almost a boy runs
forward and grasps the machine guns trigger The man who is
flattened beneath it rises from the ground twitching his
shoulders left and right to make the fire traverse

Witt dodges through the trees The BULLETS shriek and hum as
they pass From time to time he drops to the ground hiding
cunning and crafty like a jungle animal

The human tripod vats up and follows him quickly with the
triggerman close behind

YOUNG JAPANESE
Slendull Slendull soju

Witt does not move To give your life gladly To lay down
your life for your friends

The Japanese soldiers come up surrounding him There is no
chance he can escape now When they are nearly on top of him
he lunges out at them and they SHOOT him down

EXT COPRA PLANTATION —- DAY

Fife listens numb with terror as American artillery rounds
SCREAM overhead His grimy face is streaked with tears
Before him on the ground lies a perfect seashell

EXT DESERTED ROAD —- DAY

An abrupt silence announces that the battle is over Witt
lies beside a Japanese soldier

MEN OF C-FOR-CHARLIE (0S)
He might of got away Look over
there

They draw closer to Witts body

EXT DESERTED ROAD —- DAY

Fife Bell Welsh Queen and Doll are gathered under the
spell of their comrades death Fife feels tie with them all
Even with Charlie Dale Even with the slain Japanese who lie
here and there like shoeless sleeping children It is as
though he had died himself and were watching the scene like a
ghost from the other side

FIFE
Youre not alone Can you hear me

He sits with his friend and holds his hand and does not utter
another word He looks intently into the dead face At last
he puts Witts hand down and walks away alone

EXT DESERTED ROAD —- DAY
Now Welsh is standing over the dead man

WELSH
Wheres your pride now
(he turns to a medic)
Bury that soldier

EXT WITTS GRAVE - DAY

Witt is buried at the edge of the straight red road They dam
his rifle in the ground set his helmet on it and tie a
dogtag to the triggerguard Fifes terror passes gradually
over into a longing for life and peace The sun gleams
through the trees overhead through the wild bananas and huge
looping lianas

EXT JUNGLE - DAY

Fife is walking to morning chow with Bell when he turns his
ankle on a half-dried rut in the road and goes down with a
thud

BELL
You all right

He has to hop along to take the weight off the inured ankle
resting his hand from time to time on Bell s shoulder The
pain is exquisite MacTae the supply sergeant comes up

MACTAE
Youre white as a sheet What the
hell happened to you there

FIFE
I stepped on it wrong

MACTAE
You been to the medics with it No
Really Youre out of your
everlovin’ mind You can get
evacuated on that

(excitedly)

I know guys w yo got shipped out on
a lot less than that

(MORE )

Let the doACGRAE (iaontshdw it to
them up at Division

FIFE
What if they turn me down

MACTAE
What have you got to lose You
wont be any worse off than you are
now will you

But Fife feels there is something else a serious moral
problem

MACTAE
Are you kidding Man if I had
somethin like that Id be up
there like a shot Trouble with me
Im so fucking healthy I aint
never gonna get myself shipped out

Fife looks at Bell He seems to want one of them to tell him
that he should stay but they cannot think of a reason to

MACTAE
I wouldnt hesitate a second If
its as bad as what I just saw it
could get you out of here If its
as bad as what I saw you got no
business in the infantry

EXT COMPANY AREA — DAY

A detachment of Japanese prisoners is passing by when
suddenly Queen steps out in front of them The guards look at
one another uncertain what they should do None is bold
enough to challenge the huge veteran

Queen stares into the face of one of the prisoners a man
half his size The Japanese is dazed and exhausted He looks
out at

(Page 178 of the original missing)
FIFE
Well if it will help it sir -- I

guess I am

Haines shrugs and again his eyes glint He turns to the
orderly

DOC HAINES
Admit this man for evacuation

Fife is afraid to believe it lest something happen to change
it Just like that Just like that and he is out Out Out
Why does he suddenly feel so guilty so alone

The evacuation order is si calls and stamped As he is going
out the flap Doc Haines calls out to him

DOC HAINES
Youre a sergeant now I see You
were a corporal before werent
you

Fife nods

EXT EXAMINING TENT —- DAY

Outside the tent Bell slaps him on the back Fife tries to
look joyful -- Bell seems to expect it -- but somehow he
cannot Things are going so fast Already a new destiny is
upon him

EXT SUPPLY AREA —- DAY

Fife and Bell sit on a packing crate in a supply area

BELL
How can you even think twice about
it

FIFE

I got my squad They depend on me
I dont want to let them down They
never let me down

BELL
Theyd all tell you to go Theyd
tell you to get as far from this
Rock as you possibly could What do
you want to stay for Everybodys
using every loophole they can think
of Youve got it made Get out

FIFE
This is the first time in my life I
ever belonged to something -- where

I had a place a real job

Bell nods MUSIC enters

BELL
You think you’re going to keep up
with each other but after a while
you dont Maybe you get a
Christmas card now and then After
a while it stops

Faintly and far away the KLAXONS start up signalling the
approach of the evening air raid Neither of them gives any
thought to seeking cover or even looks up

FIFE

I was afraid up there It was as
bad as ever I was lying there and
those treebursts were coming in --
I thought I wasnt going to get up
I thought they were going to have
to send the MPs after me

(looking off)
I thought Id licked it Once and
for all That I wouldnt be afraid
n more Its going to keep coming
back Im going to have to fight it
every day of my life

(after a pause)
I dont want to run from a fight
Only thing I still want to have a
wife and kids Witt was my best
friend

BELL
You make other friends

Fife feels a sudden love of home a greed for life and
deliverance He does not want to go back broken and burned
out He loves the Army But he hates it too -- the corrupt
ignorant monotonous rut that everybody is in the
indignities they all must suffer -- the sick green horror of
war most of all

FIFE
If I go back Im finished Ill go
over the hill or go crazy one

BELL
Maybe youre not a soldier

Bell looks at Fife and smiles

EXT SHORE —- DAY

Fife walks along the shore alone Crabs scuttle back and
forth on the seething wet sand He sees the broken shells
the wavy lines of wrack a germinating coconut Is life like
the sea brutal and relentless Does it know or care whom
it smashes on the rocks

EXT HQ AREA (MAIL CALL)- DAY

At mail call Bell gets the letter he has been waiting for
from his wife They have just broken off for noon chow and
Corporal Weld has come around with a batch of new mail When
he opens it and sees how it begins he knows what it is She
has been doing it Shes been doing it He feels sick all
over His legs are shaky and his hands and arms are shaky He
sits down on a coco palm log

Doll sees him and comes to his side MUSIC enters

BELL

She wants a divorce To marry him
She says shes fallen in love and
she wants that love while she can
have it Shes asking my
forgiveness

(tapping the letter)
Its all so calm and proper You
could show it to your mother

(after a silence)
She says it like she was going out
to buy a new dress

Trucks of new replacements are coming in The green men study
the veterans of C-for-Charlie with open-mouthed awe

INT HQ TENT - DAY

Bell has come with the letter to CAPTAIN BOSCHE the new
company commander They are alone The reaction he gets from
Bosche is astonishing even to him in his state of despair
As he reads the Captains hands begin to shake until the
letter rattles His face becomes as white as a sheet of his
own memo paper with a rage so great that it seems to bunch
his hard round little face into a tight little ball Somehow
Bosche gets command of himself again

CAPT BOSCHE
You know of course that you do
not have to accede to this request
(MORE )

Your wife €APTL AOSCHMigerced pr
separation without your official
permission

(as Bell nods)
Something else With a letter like
this in your possession you have
the right to stop all allotments
all payments all government
insurance policies

BELL
(tiredly)
I want to give it to her I wanted
to ask you if youd draft an
official letter from you for me
giving her the permission

CAPT BOSCHE
I dont understand Why do you want
to do that

BELL
Well I guess its just that whats
the point of being married to a
woman who doesnt want to be
married to you

Captain Bosches eyes have narrowed to slits and with them
he stares at Bell profoundly

CAPT BOSCHE
Well there are all sort of
attitudes and opinions I guess
Thats what makes the world go
round Youve got nothing to be
ashamed of

BELL
Will you draft the letter for me
sir

CAPT BOSCHE
I certainly will

Bell turns to go

CAPT BOSCHE
Oh Bell
(holding out a sheaf of
papers)
This came in yesterday for you I
held it up a little because I
wanted to write my own endorsement
(MORE )

I just thoGApe tt RASGHE( admhtdbe a

BELL

CAPT BOSCHE
Of course Take all the time you
want Youve had several big things
today And if you want to change
your mind about that other matter

BELL
Thank you sir

EXT HQ TENT - DAY
Outside the tent Bell has given Doll the news

DOLL
If you take it theyll post you
somewhere else No telling where
youll end up

Bell gone Bell too Doll feels alone and afraid

BELL

EXT HQ AREA - DAY

His duffel bag packed Bell stands watching a Melanesian
woman The next day he will be sworn in and transferred
Storm it turns out is leaving with him He is glad to get
out alive and not the least bit guilty As the jeep pulls
away Welsh sends him a salute

Doll sits alone at the other end of the bivouac Bell has
given him an address on a scrap of paper but who knows if
they will ever see each other again or whether anything will
be the same after this war He looks around at the new
unfamiliar faces Will this be his fate to watch his friends
leave him one by one

EXT EVACUATION HOSPITAL —- DAY

Welsh stands outside the hospital He looks at the ground a
moment then flips his cigarette away and goes inside

INT EVACUATION HOSPITAL - DAY

Welsh sees Fife and wanders over to his bed

FIFE
What’re you doing here First

WELSH
I had to bring somebody his gear
So youre finally makin it out

FIFE

WELSH
Whens the ship leave
FIFE

WELSH
You what

FIFE
Well yes I mean you know Im
gonna miss the comp’ny And its --
its sort of like running out In
one way

Fife does not want to leave this island a coward or a sneak
He expected to be admired for it instead Welsh leers at him
in silence his mad eyes gleaming

WELSH
Sure kid I think if you feel like
that you oughta come back

FIFE
You think so I thought I might
slip out of here tonight maybe

WELSH

You should

(then grinning his slow

sly grin)
You want to know why I busted you --
out of the orderly room You
thought it was because we thought
you werent coming back didnt
you Well it wasnt It was
because you were such a lousy
fucking bad clerk I HAD to do it

If he could Fife would hit him he is so furious He knows
he wasnt a bad clerk But he is lying on his back and before
he can get up Welsh is gone down the aisle and out through
the flap

FIFE
You fucking bastard Youre sick
You feel sorry for yourself
Bastard

The orderlies rush down the aisle to calm him Silently
struggling not to Fife weeps tears of rage and desperation

EXT AIRFIELD (DRUMSARA) - DUSK

MUSIC enters as three days later Fife boards a cargo plane
No one from the company is present to see him off they are
all far away on the other side of the island He bobs like a
cork in a sea of men he does not know

EXT AIRFIELD (DAINTREE) —- DAY
Captain Bosche addresses the assembled company

CAPT BOSCHE

Now I know you men are making and
drinking this goddamn swipe Thats
okay by me Any man in an outfit of
mine can get as drunk as he wants
to every night as long as hes
ready -- and in shape -- to make
reveille and carry out any
assignment hes given If he cant
do that hes gonna have trouble
and from me Personal

(a pause)
Now I prefer to think of myself as
a family man And thats what we
all are here whether we like it
or not A family Im the father
and -- I guess that makes Sergeant
Welsh here the mother

(there is some laughter)
And whether you guys like it or
not that makes all of you the
children in this family Now a
family can only have one head and
thats the father Me Fathers
the head and mother runs it
Thats the way its gonna be here
If any of you guys want to see me
about anything anything at all
youll find I m available On the
other hand Im gonna be busy
makin’ a living for this family so
if its not important maybe mother
can handle it Thats all except
for one more thing Were into
training now as all of you know
You all know what kind of training
it is too Well Im making this
training just as tough on everybody
as I possibly can Including me So
expect it Now thats all -- Except
one more thing Itll be a long
time before we get home The war is

York So lets stick together

(MORE )

And now thats really all

The tough little guy has not smiled once even at his own
jokes Everybody likes him Even Welsh seems to like him

EXT HQ AREA - DAY

A week later Sgt Welsh stands in front of the company
wearing a full field pack

A YOUNG LIEUTENANT
Sergeant Welsh our scheduled
transportation has been delayed
The trucks were diverted to another
unit What do you suggest we do

WELSH
Well go out the way we came sir

The lieutenant nods and they exchange a salute Welsh turns
to face the men standing in ranks next to their equipment

VOICES
First platoon all present and
accounted for Second platoon

WELSH
All right -- move Move

EXT ROAD TO BEACH —- DAY

The men of C-for-Charlie march to the beach -- past a herd of
cattle past a Melanesian woman who gazes at them from beside
a stream Another company goes by headed up toward the line
Stalks of red ginger glow amid the strangler figs and vines
Outside a leaf chapel a group of Melanesians are singing
The stream where Dale stooped to drink the bloody water flows
clear again Some suggestion that in time the earth will
cleanse itself

EXT CEMETERY - DAY

Their route leads them past the new cemetery Plodding along
gasping in the airless humidity the cemetery looks very
green and cool to them The area has been well drained and
blue-grass has been planted on it Quartermaster men move
here and there keeping it up and tending it Big sprinklers
send their long gossamer jets swirling through the air above
the crosses Already grass rises from the grave mounds

EXT BEACH (WANGETTI) LCIs —- DAY

They arrive at the beach LCIs ply the waters between the
beach and the big ships that wait offshore to receive them
Melanesian stevedores work among the stacks of crates A
sailor standing on an oil drum signalling the ships with
semaphore flags
