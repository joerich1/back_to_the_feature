TEASER
ECU OF A CLOSED EYE As we hear a WHISPERED VOICE say

VOICE (0S)
Wake up --

The eye SNAPS OPEN and we reveal
INT BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 1

A YOUNG BOY (eight years old blonde hair) being rousted from
sleep by his MOM (late-twenties)

She’s scared She levels her gaze at her son

MOM
He’s here

The boy’s face goes cold As he hurries out of bed we hear
the muffled sounds of FRANTIC BANGING at the front door

Were in the BOY’S BEDROOM -- it’s small simple Not a lot
of decorations -- nothing that would indicate time or place

Someone desperately wants in this house -- we hear his ANGRY
VOICE yelling offscreen --

VOICE
Open the door --

And this all plays FRANTIC -- the BANGING and the YELLING
continue throughout the scene keeping tension at a fever
pitch

Mom looks around trying to figure out what to do Her hands
shake slightly -- she’s rattled

We’re CLOSE ON THE BOY -- we see all this from his POV his
Mom quickly makes the boy’s bed As she does so

MOM
He’1ll think you’re still with your
grandparents

She looks at him

MOM (CONT’D)
Get under the bed
LOST Outlaws (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 121004 2
(CONTD) 1

He doesn’t move She gets down on her knees looks him in
the eyes Tries to speak to him in a calm voice

MOM (CONTD)
Listen to mommy Get under the
bed Don’t make a sound Don’t
come out

WHAM There it is again -- whoever it is he’s trying to
break down the front door

MOM (CONT’D)
(still focused on her son)
No matter what happens -- don’t
come out
(beat)
Okay

ON THE BOY as he steels himself trying to be strong He
nods She kisses him

MOM (CONT’D)
I love you
(then)
Go

He scrambles under the bed WE STAY WITH HIM as he turns
around looks out

HIS POV from under the bed -- his mom’s bare feet walk across
the WOODEN FLOORBOARDS of his bedroom She walks out of the
room closes the door

ON THE BOY

He’s breathing hard We plays this all on him as he listens
intently WHAM He tenses at the sound WHAM He tenses
again

And then with an earsplitting CRASH the front door GIVES
WAY We hear the wood splinter as the man KICKS THE FRONT
DOOR IN

We hear a flurry of YELLING -- their MUFFLED VOICES
overlapping -- impossible to make out But he’s SHOUTING
She’s PLEADING Then --

MOM (OS) (CONTD)
(screaming)
What the hell are you --

BANG
LOST Outlaws (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 121004
(CONTD) 1

The boy jerks as a GUNSHOT RINGS OUT We hear his BREATH
CATCH in HORROR

A quick succession of shots follow -- bang bang bang bang

And then SILENCE

PUSH IN on the boy He’s terrified -- we hear his sharp
quick BREATHS

As he looks out from under his bed we hear the sound of
BOOTS walking across the hardwood floor The boy’s eyes go
wide

HIS POV -- as the door to his room opens -- CREEAAK -- and A
MAN steps into the room We see only HIS BOOTS and as he
walks each step RINGS OUT on the hardwood floor

The boots walk right up to the bed then turn around as the
man SITS DOWN on the bed CRREAK -- the bed sags under his
weight forcing the boy even closer to the ground

He looks up toward the sagging bed above him as we hear --
CLICK -- the sound of a gun being COCKED

A few tension-filled beats and then

BANG
INT SAWYER’S TENT - NIGHT 2
SAWYER jerks awake He’s in a COLD SWEAT

And we put it together He was the boy We’re CLOSE ON HIM
as he gasps for air at the intensity of the nightmare

We watch him go through the motions looks around breathing
hard slowly realizes where he is It was a nightmare

And then -- something RUSTLES
Sawyer freezes
HIS POV -- the shadows around him START TO MOVE

Something is in his tent with him

Sawyer backs up against his tent In the shadows we see the
DARK OUTLINE of his predator

(CONTD) 2

Whatever it is it’s BIG Eight-hundred pounds of animal
Slowly moving RIGHT TOWARDS HIM

Sawyer reaches out grabs a FLASHLIGHT SHINES it to see a
huge glimmering brown eye With his other hand he grabs a
HEAVY SCRAP of airplane wreckage -- some sort of HYDRAULIC
ROD perhaps As the beast moves towards him Sawyer SWINGS
with all his might CUT TO

EXT BEACH - SAWYER’S AREA - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 3

We’re outside SAWYER’S TENT -- establishing its location on
the beach at the edge of the jungle We hear an UNGODLY
SCREECH from inside as Sawyer CLUBS THE BEAST

Suddenly the blue tarp Sawyer uses as part of his structure
is ripped from its moorings The beast is running away --
and taking the tarp with it

The tarp and the animal ROCKET OFF INTO the jungle

And Sawyer’s running right after it

EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 4

WE‘RE WITH SAWYER running through the jungle He doesn’t get
far -- the beast is long gone And shirtless and shoeless
he’s in no condition to give chase

His adrenaline’s pumping Fired up no scared He looks
around -- what the hell was that He takes a few deep
breaths then turns to head back toward his campsite

And that’s when the WHISPERS start

They fade in gradually (as they did in episode 108) Sawyer
glances around -- who the fuck is saying that We scan the
jungle -- it’s dark creepy But nobody’s there

We 360 around Sawyer as the whispers BUILD And as they
reach crescendo they CUT OUT COMPLETELY replaced by a
single WHISPERED VOICE

WHISPERED VOICE
I was gonna pay --

Sawyer goes COMPLETELY PALE Off his terrified look we --

ACT ONE

TRACK across the scattered DEBRIS of Sawyer’s area It’s a
MESS -- since the tent came down the wind has scattered much
of the CLOTHES MAGAZINES and GEAR Sawyer’s been hoarding

FIND Sawyer angrily collecting his belongings into a pile
SAYID stands nearby surveying the damage

SAYID
A boar Took you tarp

SAWYER
(muttering)
It was dark -- but yeah Pretty
sure it was a boar

SAYID
I thought the boar had vacated this
area

Sawyer clearly does not want to have this conversation
SAWYER
Well genius I think we got some

bad info

SAYID
What was it doing in your tent

SAWYER
It was staring at me

Sayid frowns Sawyer realizes how ridiculous that sounds
SAWYER (CONT’D)

Then it came at me So I hit it
And it took off --

He gestures toward the jungle where the boar disappeared

SAWYER (CONTD)
Into the jungle

SAYID
With your tarp
(pause then)
Perhaps it wanted to go camping

Sawyer grits his teeth

SAWYER
You enjoying yourself

Sayid thinks about it then

SAYID
A bit Yes

Sawyer shakes his head fed up He starts walking into the
jungle after his tent

SAWYER
Laugh it up Mohammed -- I get back
and find my stuff’s gone I’m
coming after you

ON SAYID -- he takes a final glance at the wreckage shakes
his head and starts to walk off After he takes a few
steps we hear

SAWYER (0S) (CONT’D)
Sayid --

Sayid turns back Sawyer’s looking at him

SAWYER (CONTD)
What did you hear

Sayid doesn’t understand the question Off his look

SAWYER (CONTD)
After you ran into the French
Woman you said you heard something
in the jungle

SAYID
(shakes his head)
I was injured and exhausted My
mind was playing tricks on me

SAWYER
What did you hear

SAYID
I thought I heard whispering

SAWYER
What was it saying

SAYID
Why Did you hear something
LOST Outlaws (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 121004
(CONTD) 5

Sawyer stares at him a beat Then

SAWYER
Forget it

We’re CLOSE ON HIM as he turns walks toward the jungle

SAWYER (CONTD)
I didn’t hear anything

WOMAN (PRE-LAP)
What are you afraid of

INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 6

A hotel room door crashes open as Sawyer and a WOMAN
(thirties attractive) tumble into the dark room They’re
ALL OVER each other making out like horny teenagers

SAWYER
Sweetness I ain’t the one
tremblin’ here --

And if this feels a bit familiar it should Sawyer’s in his
professional con man form As they kiss passionately
crashing down on the bed

WOMAN
I can help with the investors --

SAWYER
-- we’re not talkin’ about this --

He kisses her acting as though he wants nothing to do with
this conversation She kisses back rolls on top of him

WOMAN
Seriously baby -- look at me --
(beat)
How much money do you need
exactly

It’s a beautiful moment for a con man and his prey But it’s
interrupted when a VOICE across the room says

VOICE (0S)
Okay this is really awkward

Sawyer and the woman JUMP IN SURPRISE They turn toward the
voice
LOST Outlaws (PINK) 1405 8
(CONTD) 6

And FIND A MAN sitting across the room at the table He’s
been there the whole time sitting in the darkness

He TURNS THE LIGHT ON and we get a better look at him This
is HIBBS He’s mid-thirties Tough but not as tough as
Sawyer

HIBBS
--but if I don’t say something
now things are liable to get
downright embarrassing

Sawyer leaps to his feet the woman huddles behind him

SAWYER
(eyes narrowing)
Hibbs --

HIBBS

Hello Sawyer

(to Woman)
Ma‘am -- I must apologize I
figured my good friend Sawyer
here’d be alone

(back to Sawyerdead

serious)
I just need a few minutes

Sawyer keeps his iron gaze locked on Hibbs It’s clear --
these guys have history After a beat Sawyer turns toward
the woman pulls her aside They speak in HUSHED TONES

SAWYER WOMAN
Listen -- -- what’s going on --
Go down to the bar get a -- Sawyer --
drink --
She looks over his shoulder -- Hibbs is admiring the hotel

artwork As Sawyer opens the door to the room
SAWYER
Soon as I get rid of him I’1ll find
you and explain everything I
promise
He kisses her ushering her out the door

We’re WITH HIBBS as the door shuts He walks towards Sawyer --
LOST Outlaws (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 121004
(CONTD) 6

HIBBS
Gotta hand it to you Sawbucks
How you find women that beautiful
to work your --

WHAM -- Sawyer GRABS HIBBS by the throat and SLAMS HIM up
against the wall

SAWYER
Now if I’m not mistaken Hibbs --

He SQUEEZES HARD Hibbs gasps in pain Whatever Sawyer’s
doing it looks like it hurts

SAWYER (CONT’D)
I’m fairly certain I said I’d kill
you if I ever saw you again

HIBBS
(between gasps)
‘s why I’m here make things
right

Sawyer holds a beat -- then releases his grasp shoves Hibbs
aside Hibbs shakes it off clearly in pain As he regards
Sawyer

HIBBS (CONTD)
‘Sides -- we both know you ain’t
the killin’ type

He composes himself reaches into his jacket pulls out a
LARGE ENVELOPE Tosses it on the table

HIBBS (CONTD)
There --
(points to envelope)
Figure that makes us even for the
Tampa job

SAWYER
(still fuming)
Now Hibbs What could possibly
make us even for the Tampa job

HIBBS
Oh I don’t know

Hibbs takes a beat clearly enjoying the moment
LOST Outlaws (PINK) 1405
(CONTD) 6

HIBBS (CONTD)
How ‘bout the known whereabouts of
the man who ruined your life

Sawyer’s face goes cold He looks at the envelope

HIBBS (CONTD)
(beat)
I’m gonna make myself a drink You
want one

Sawyer shakes his head walks over to the table sits down
Hibbs opens the MINIBAR As he pours himself a drink we

notice Hibbs is missing his LEFT RING-FINGER just above the
first knuckle (why That’s another episode my friends)

HIBBS (CONTD)
You remember Old Man Parks right --
ran capper for us on that gig in
Atlanta

SAWYER
What about him

HIBBS

(beat)
We still talk from time to time --
he’s been working the wire at an
off-track parlor down in Sydney

(beat)
So last week one of his regulars
gets a little too sauced starts
running his mouth about his glory
days as a grifter

Sawyer opens the envelope -- pulls out a FILE On top of
which is a PHOTO A MAN IN HIS LATE-FIFTIES Shot with a
LONG LENS SURVEILLANCE-STYLE

HIBBS (CONTD)

This guy --

(taps photo)
“Frank Duckett” Real hard-luck
case -- gambling addict alcoholic
runs a shrimp truck --

(aside)
You know what a shrimp truck is

SAWYER
(after a beat)
A truck that sells shrimp
LOST Outlaws (PRODUCTION DRAFT)
(CONTD) HIBBS
(to himself)
Damnit It is obvious I owe
Parks a fifty
(taps photo)
Back in the day this guy Duckett
used to be quite a hustler
(beat)
He ran the romance angle -- hook
the wife take the husband for all
his money Used to be pretty good
at it too from what I hear
(beat)
Until sadly one of his marks in
despair took a gun shot up his
wife and blew his own head off
(eyeing Sawyer)
All in front of their little boy

ON SAWYER feeling the full weight of what he’s holding He

leafs through the file we see various FORMS -- police

records DMV printouts

HIBBS (CONTD)
I paid Tony to pull his jacket --
turns out “Frank Duckett” used to

be named “Frank Sawyer” The
name I believe you appropriated for
yourself
SAWYER
(quietly)

This is him

HIBBS
(nods )
That’s him

CREEP IN on Sawyer his eyes going cold as he looks at the

photo of the man who ruined his life --

EXT OUTSIDE THE VALLEY - MORNING

WE’RE LOOKING DOWN THE BARREL OF A GUN MACRO-CLOSE

AND --

It FLIPS up TWIRLS around deftly -- Now its HANDLE OUT And

we RACK FOCUS to find the gunslinger is --

KATE

(CONTD) 7

KATE stands with JACK by the tree where he stows THE
HALLIBURTON CASE

JACK
Always a pleasure

Jack takes the gun from Kate EJECTS the CLIP as he places
both pieces back into the case

KATE
Anyone curious where they came
from

JACK

The others know there was a Marshal
on the plane Guess they assume he
was travelling alone Protecting
them from terrorists

(beat then)
Sounded like a good theory to me

ON KATE A moment of silent THANKS --

Jack LOCKS up the case ties the LEATHER STRAP with THE KEY
back around his neck

KATE
You get all of the guns back
JACK
All except one
KATE JACK
Who
-- How about I give you three
guesses
KATE
Sawyer
Jack gives her a look -- “Of course it’s fucking Sawyer” --

Puts the Halliburton in its hiding place begins to CAMO the
opening

KATE (CONTD)
I can get it back

JACK
(uh huh)
Really How you gonna do that
LOST Outlaws (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 121004 13
(CONTD) 7

KATE
I speak his language

Jack finishes secreting the case Turns to Kate shaking
his head --

JACK
We’ve done this before Kate If I
remember it right you made out
with him and never even had what
you said you could get

Beat Kate could try to defend herself here But instead --
KATE
I only made out with Sawyer because

torturing him didn’t work

Another beat Then Jack can’t help but GRIN at the pure
absurdity of it Tension broken --

JACK
Let him keep the gun It’s not
worth it

KATE

Why You afraid he’s gonna shoot
me if I ask

JACK
(serious now)
No I just don’t want you to owe
him anything

And that’s as close as Jack will ever get to declaring that
he might just be JEALOUS And OFF KATE perhaps appreciating
precisely that

EXT OUTSIDE THE VALLEY - MORNING 8

Michael has a makeshift worktable on which he’s sawing
lengths of bamboo for his raft project

CAMERA TRACKS to find CHARLIE sitting off by himself BINDING
a piece of BENT WRECKAGE to the end of one of the GOLD CLUBS
And with just one look at him it is instantly clear -- This
is not the Charlie we know and love Something just OFF

CLOSE on him -- VERY focused on the task at hand wrapping
the WIRE around and around and around

Very pregnant

Charlie just nods and continues BINDING Not rudely
DISTRACTED After watching him for a few beats --

(beat)
They were nice dreams

(beat)
Thought I’d see if you wanted to

She’s obviously reaching out Trying to make some kind of
connection But Charlie’s so focused it takes him a beat to

realize what she’s saying

CHARLIE
Sorry Can’t right now Theres
(reluctant)
something I have to do

HURLEY (0S)
Dude -- not the golf club

Charlie and Claire turn to see HURLEY -- standing there with

a makeshift TOOL (kinda resembles a shovel) of his own

CHARLIE
It was all I could find

LOST Outlaws (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 121004 15

HURLEY

Charlie hops to his feet Offers Claire that weird smile --

CHARLIE
Excuse me Weve gotta
(not gonna go there)
I‘1l see you later all right

CLAIRE
Sure Yeah All right

And Charlie walks off
Hurley stands there for a beat looking at Claire And he’s

got no fucking idea what to say to her So he just raises
his hand offers a little WAVE --

HURLEY

Hurley shuffles off after Charlie And OFF Claire
displaced confused and ALONE --

EXT JUNGLE - DAY 9
Sawyer walks through the dense jungle searching for --
HIS BLUE TARP

It’s in a clearing the wind’s blown it up against the tree
Sawyer gathers it up in his arms heads back toward camp

EXT JUNGLE - TALL GRASS - DAY - CONTINUOUS 10
We’re with Sawyer as he walks through TALL GRASS He’s got
his tarp in his arms As he walks we hear the wind blowing

through the grass and ever-so-faintly

WHISPERED VOICE
I was gonna pay --

Sawyer stops in his tracks Did I just hear that
As he listens closely he hears RUSTLING Coming from BEHIND

HIM He turns around and sees MOVEMENT IN THE GRASS
Something’s out there

LOST Outlaws (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 121004 16

(CONTD) 10
We catch a glimpse of it -- it’s THE BOAR And it’s charging

right towards Sawyer

Oh Shit

Sawyer starts to run HANDHELD CHAOS as he sprints through
the jungle He throws his tarp away As he flees we catch
glimpses of the beast -- blurs of fur amidst the grass This
thing’s moving fast

BOAR POV -- as it rushes up right behind Sawyer --

The animal SHRIEKS and Sawyer’s legs are cut out from under
him as the beast runs him down Sawyer goes down hard
headfirst into the mud We catch QUICK FRENETIC POPS of the
beast as it TRAMPLES SAWYER

It all happens fast And then it’s over The beast is
gone It disappears into the tall grass Just like that

Leaving Sawyer facedown and trampled in the mud

He slowly gets to his feet He’s filthy Breathing hard
Sore as shit from the hit But he checks himself over -- no
severe damage

WE’‘RE CLOSE ON HIS FACE as his fear hardens into anger

SAWYER
SON OF A BITCH --

HARD CUT TO
EXT BEACH - SAWYER’S AREA - DAY 11
A KNIFE IS SLAMMED INTO A SCABBARD WIDEN OUT AS Sawyer
shoves it into his BACKPACK He’s focused -- angry
determination etched on his face
WE PULL BACK as he rummages through the debris of his site
packing for the hunt He shoves various articles of FOOD and
CLOTHES into his pack
And then we see Kate is there with him
She sees Sawyer’s site is amess -- debris scattered about --
and he’s filthy covered in dried mud from his run-in with

the boar

KATE
A boar Did all this
LOST Outlaws (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 121004 17
11 (CONTD) 11

We can just feel the frustration rising off Sawyer

SAWYER

Yes A boar did all this

(ranting)
Last night it wrecked my tent
Then this morning when I was
going to get my tent back it
attacked me from behind and ran
off into the jungle Like a
coward

Long beat as Kate stares at him

KATE
A boar wouldnt attack you for
no reason

SAWYER
Thank you boar expert This one

did

He searches through a pile looking for something in
particular

SAWYER (CONTD)
(muttering)
It’s harassing me

He finds what he’s looking for HIS GUN

KATE
What are you doing

He checks the magazine slams it into his gun Tucks the gun
into his waistband

SAWYER
Gettin’ even

KATE
(rolls eyes)

We WIDEN TO REVEAL he’s poking at a DEAD BODY wrapped for
burial in airplane blankets Charlie holds his shovel
Hurley’s is next to his feet

HURLEY

were about to leave his hand pops
out of the dirt --

Charlie takes his shovel breaks ground Shrugs

CHARLIE
(matter of fact)
S’pose we’ll have to bury him deep
then

Hurley keeps his wary eyes focused on the body

HURLEY

(shakes head)
Doesn’t matter There’s no grave
that can hold the undead

(beat)
No this ends with you and me

And Charlie says it so simply it brings Hurley back to
reality He exhales

HURLEY
Nah I’m good

He takes one last look at the body then picks up his shovel

HURLEY (CONTD)
Let’s just get it done

Charlie nods Hurley breaks ground next to him

We’re CLOSE ON HURLEY as he glances at Charlie -- how is
Charlie so calm about this

EXT JUNGLE - DAY 13

WE’RE MOVING SLOWLY through the dense foliage of the jungle
to find Sawyer creeping through the trees

He’s focused Not making a lot of noise It’s clear he’s in
tracking mode -- he gets low studies --

A PRINT
Barely visible in the soil
Sawyer looks it over surveys the jungle in front of him As

he does all this we start to get the sense that Sawyer may
in fact know what the hell he’s doing

That is until

KATE (0S)
That’s a footprint

Sawyer’s face falls He turns and looks behind him Finds
Kate walking out of the trees She’s wearing a BACKPACK As
she speaks it’s all very matter-of-fact no sense of
smugness whatsoever

LOST Outlaws (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 121004
(CONTD) 13
KATE (CONTD)
(looking it over)
Based on the weight distance
between strides I’m pretty sure
youve been tracking Boone for the
last hour
SAWYER
(annoyed)
Look --
KATE
Could be Jin I suppose
SAWYER
I’m tickled you’ve taken such an
interest in my affairs -- I really
am -- so don’t take it personal
when I tell you to go --
KATE
I want carte blanche
SAWYER
(after a beat)
What
KATE
It’s pretty simple You can’t
track this boar without my help
SAWYER
Is that right
KATE
That’s right Over the last few
hours you’ve managed to follow the
tracks of --
(counts them off on her
fingers)
Humans birds a rockslide
yourself everything except a
boar actually
(beat)
You have no idea what you’re doing
And he can’t do anything but steam -- because he knows she’s
right

KATE (CONTD)
So I help you I want carte
blanche

KATE (CONTD)
(off his look)
It means “blank check”

SAWYER
I know what it means

KATE
Every time I want something from
your stash -- medicine soap
whatever -- I get it No questions
asked

Goddamn it does he want to tell her to fuck off But he
knows he’s screwed without her

SAWYER
Carte blanche

KATE
Take it or leave it

And we see it -- the moment where he forces himself to put on
a good face and act like this doesn’t bother him in the
slightest

SAWYER
All right You got a deal

And as Sawyer watches her lead him away --
OMITTED 14
EXT DOCKS - DAY - FLASHBACK A15
Sawyer walks down an old dock toward a run-down boat repair
shop Behind him we see one of the bridges of SYDNEY HARBOR

Australia doesn’t allow its
citizenry to own handguns You get
nicked with that --

SAWYER
(without looking up)
I ain’t gonna rat you out

LAURENCE
Secondly -- no refunds Even for
dear friends a’ mine such as
yourself You decide you don’t
need a weapon -- not my bikker

SAWYER
(as he counts)
Won’t be a problem

LAURENCE

(studying him)
Been doin’ this a while a man
buys a compact 357 with hollow

point loads -- he ain’t lookin’ to
scare or steal he’s lookin’ to
kill

LAURENCE (CONTD)
And that’s all well and good to
talk about in the beautiful Sydney
Harbor but when it comes down to
it he may find he doesn’t have what
it takes to do the job

SAWYER

Your sales pitch needs some work
LAURENCE

I’m sayin’ -- you point a gun ata

man you look him in the eye -- you
find out who you are

(beat)
And if you should find that you’re
not a killer -- well

(beat)

There’s no refunds

CLAIRE

In bits and pieces

Certain people seem familiar
Like I’ve met them before in
another life

Helps more I talk about it
Brings things into focus you know

She shuffles a bit getting at what’s bothering her

CLAIRE (CONTD)
But everyone’s avoiding me
(beat)
I think I freak them out I’m “the
weird amnesia chick”

JACK
Nice to meet you “weird amnesia
chick” I’m the “heroic doctor”

CLAIRE
Is that so

JACK
Minus the heroic part

Claire smiles as Jack says in his most comforting tone

JACK (CONTD)

They’re just confused

I know how they feel

EXT JUNGLE - LATE AFTERNOON 18

Kate and Sawyer trudge through the jungle -- Dirty and SWEATY
(and on these two somehow it looks GREAT) BREATHING HARD

Kate stops looks up at the sky Frowns Sawyer gets ahead
before he realizes she’s not beside him Turns --

SAWYER
What

KATE
Gonna be dark in half an hour

SAWYER
Then I guess we got half an hour to
catch us a hog

Kate shakes her head pulls off her PACK --

KATE
Suit yourself

He went that way I’m making camp
while I can still see

SAWYER
What You’re just gonna let it get
away Howre we --

KATE
Boars sleep too

ON SAWYER -- Frustrated wanting to continue on

But without his guide he’s completely helpless to do
anything about it As he drops his OWN PACK in frustration --

EXT JUNGLE - CAMPSITE - NIGHT’ 19

CLOSE ON A FIRE as a PIECE OF DRY WOOD kicks up a field of
EMBERS as it’s dropped into the flames

Kate settles down next to the fire Sawyer on the opposite
side Two outlaws camped out under the stars Hell if we
didn’t know any better

We’d think this was downright romantic

Sawyer digs around his pack finally finds what he’s looking
for -- a MINI-BOTTLE OF VODKA Cracks it open

Tosses it back in one cool shot REVEAL Kate having watched
the whole process

KATE
Where’d you get that
SAWYER
Plane
KATE SAWYER
Jack was looking for the
alcohol cart -- -- Well it’s a good thing I

found it instead then huh
Kate just looks at him No idea what she’s thinking Then --

KATE
Got anymore of those

SAWYER
I got more a’ everything But you
ain’t got carte blanche yet

KATE
Is that a “no”

Now it’s his turn to look at her And dammit if Sawyer ain’t
charmed Reaches into his pack emerges with a whole HANDFUL
of mini-bottles

SAWYER
All right Sassafrass -- but you
wanna drink You gotta play

KATE

A game is what it is Call ita

better For example

I know you never went to college

KATE
(he’s right)
And how do you know that
SAWYER
If you had you’d a heard of “I

Never”

Sawyer tosses her a MINI-BOTTLE --

SAWYER (CONTD)
Simple You say “I never” and
then finish the sentence If it’s
something you did you drink If
it’s something you never did you
don’t drink

Kate absorbs this Then --

KATE
That makes absolutely no sense

SAWYER

Then learn by example
(declares )

I have never kissed a man
(a beat)

Now you drink
(another beat)

‘Cause you’ve kissed a man

Subtext -- That man being him Kate sighs --

KATE
What’s the object of this game

SAWYER
What’s the object of anything

Deciding whether or not to embark on this

So she cracks open her bottle DRINKS Sawyer grins

And Sawyer’s grin is GONE But rules are rules He drinks

SAWYER
I never been to Disneyland

Kate does NOT drink

Aww That’s plain sad

Kate eyes him for a second And then she takes a little sip

KATE
Didn’t last long

Sawyer INTRIGUED as she reaches for a new bottle --
KATE (CONT’D)
I never blamed a boar for all my

problems

O-kay Now it’s getting personal Yet Sawyer DRINKS
Fires back --

SAWYER
I never cared about getting carte
blanche ‘cause I just wanted to
spend some time with the only other
person on this island who just
don’t belong

On KATE And that flash of VULNERABILITY Yeah -- He
fucking NAILED her But she meets his gaze Takes a drink
And fires right back

KATE
I never carried a letter around for
twenty years because I can’t get
over my baggage

And Sawyer goes cold Locks that stare into her But
drinks Holds the stare for a beat then

SAWYER
I never killed a man

And there it is After all this time The handcuffs The
case The guns The Marshal It doesn’t matter when he
found out but he KNOWS

He looks at her for a reaction SEES a flash of intense
vulnerability then covers it She doesn’t want to give him
the fucking satisfaction

And she drinks

ON SAWYER Not as surprised as we might expect him to be
But what is surprising

Is that Sawyer drinks TOO Drains his whole mini-bottle
And when he’s done --

SAWYER (CONTD)
Well looks like we got something
in common after all

And OFF this dark tableau --

ON A GUNSHOT we CUT IN to the FLASHBACK we saw at the

hear the quick succession of shots -- bang bang bang bang

And then SILENCE

PUSH IN on young Sawyer He’s terrified -- we hear his
sharp quick BREATHS As he looks out from under his bed we
hear the sound of SOMETHING walking across the hardwood
floor The boy’s eyes go wide

HIS POV -- as the door to his room opens -- CREEAAK -- just

Off his look we CUT WIDE TO REVEAL their camp has been
RANSACKED The entire contents of Sawyer’s backpack are
strewn all about the area -- torn clothes empty liquor
bottles food wrappers It’s a mess

SAWYER (CONT’D)
I don’t believe this

KATE
(reluctant)
Yeah There’s hoof marks
everywhere and most of your stuff
looks like it’s been chewed
SAWYER
Look at this
KATE
I can’t figure out how we didn’t
wake up --
SAWYER

(looking around furious)
It ate all our stuff

KATE
No it only destroyed your stuff
My stuff’s fine

She points -- there’s her backpack on the ground completely
intact Sawyer’s face darkens
SAWYER
That hog’s gonna suffer I swear to

god --

And as he says that they hear a rustling in the jungle
Sawyer locks eyes at Kate -- Whip-fast he yanks the gun from
his waistband aims it just as

LOCKE
Walks right into their campsite Backpack strapped to his
shoulders He’s eating a piece of fruit not bothered in the

slightest

LOCKE

They just stare at him -- what the fuck is he doing way out
here Locke takes a bite of his fruit surveying the mess
around them Then

LOCKE (CONT’D)
What happened to your campsite

EXT JUNGLE - MORNING - LATER 22

CLOSE ON A TIN POT heating coffee over the fire WIDEN OUT
as Locke pulls the pot off pours CUPS for himself and Kate

While they talk Sawyer angrily walks around camp picking up
his destroyed items --

KATE
So what’re you doing all the way
out here John

LOCKE
Looking for salvage from the crash
Tail came off over the water so we
were losing pieces as we came in
I’ve been back-tracking the course

KATE
Find anything useful

LOCKE
The occasional scrap of metal --
(raises his cup)
-- few bags of coffee Stumbled
across your path about a mile back
-- thought I’d say howdy

Kate studies Locke for a moment Maybe starting to feel that
Locke ain’t exactly telling the complete truth here Then --

SAWYER
SONOFABITCH

Sawyer throws down a T-SHIRT like it’s on fire --

SAWYER (CONTD)
It peed on my damn shirt
(amazed almost)
Took my shirt out of my pack and
peed on it

attacked me -- Maybe it’s got your scent

Doesn’t like your cologne

I don’t wear cologne

-- Yes you do

He’s got it in for me

KATE
It’s just a boar

Sawyer stares at Kate Kate stares at Sawyer Then --

LOCKE
My sister Jeannie died when I was a
boy She fell off the monkey bars
Broke her neck

Kate and Sawyer turn to Locke both wondering what’s gonna

justify that segue --

LOCKE (CONTD)
My mother -- well she blamed
herself of course Thought she
shouldve been watching closer

(beat)
So she stopped eating Stopped
sleeping Then she just stopped
speaking all together She’d just
sit on the couch and stare off into
space The neighbors started
talking -- afraid she might do
something to herself I guess

coffee savoring it)

And Sawyer does not like Lockes gaze
can SEE right INTO HIM

Mmmmm That’s good
(then)

Anyway about six months after
Jeannie’s funeral this golden
retriever comes padding up our
driveway walks right into our

house sits down on the floor and
looks right at my mother there on

the couch And my mother looks
back at the dog And after a

minute of this -- them both staring

at each other like that
(beat)
My mother burst into tears

LOCKE (CONTD)
Beautiful dog No tags No

collar Healthy And sweet A
little older than a puppy About

six months we figured
(and here it is)

Dog slept in Jeannie’s old room on
Jeannie’s old bed and stayed with

us until my mother passed eight

years later Disappeared back to
wherever it was she came from in

the first place

KATE
You’re saying the dog was your
sister

LOCKE

Well that would be silly

Then he turns to Sawyer --

LOCKE (CONTD)
But my mother thought it was
Thought Jeannie came back to let

her know that it was okay To tell
her the accident wasn’t her fault

To let her off the hook

Locke drains his coffee Story ended Sawyer still
Well Kate’s a pragmatist --

Because somehow

it

Kate looks to Sawyer but he is absolutely RIVETED on Locke --

LOST Outlaws (BLUE ) 121304 37

(CONTD) 22

And as twisted and bizarre as this parable is we’re most
certain that Sawyer is BUYING INTO IT --

SAWYER
So whose fault was it
LOCKE
Sorry
SAWYER

The accident On the monkey bars

LOCKE
Oh
(thinks then)
I don’t know Wasn’t there

SAWYER
Then who says your sister wanted to
let your momma off the hook

Locke considers this Then --

LOCKE
Well I suppose if she hadnt
(beat)
Jeannie would’ve come back as a
much meaner dog wouldn’t she

Locke smiles but Sawyer doesn’t take it as a joke Not at
all And as we PUSH IN ON SAWYER we CUT TO

holding the 357 REVOLVER he purchased at his side He puts
it in his coat pocket

WIDEN TO REVEAL Sawyer is standing not far from a lonely
SHRIMP TRUCK open for business on the side of the Australian
beach Sawyer scans the area Nobody is around except a
single customer at the truck

And now Sawyer slowly starts walking towards it His hand’s
in his jacket pocket holding the gun

He approaches the truck Gets in line behind the remaining
CUSTOMER As he does so he glances up toward the man
working at the counter and we see --

LOST Outlaws (BLUE ) 121304 38
(CONTD) 23

It’s him

The guy who ruined Sawyer’s life The guy Hibbs showed us
with the picture in Act One The Original Sawyer (but for
the sake of clarity let’s refer to him by his current alias
“Duckett” )

DUCKETT’s middle-aged Sagging face He has a sense of
danger about him -- a tough guy stuck behind the counter of a
second-rate shrimp truck

ON SAWYER -- his eyes are locked on Duckett And as we HOLD
ON HIM everything GOES QUIET

ON DUCKETT -- he takes the money from the customer in front
of Sawyer Everything played silent

BACK ON SAWYER -- we see it play out on his face -- he’s
found him The man he’s been looking foro his entire life

Sawyer’s so focused in fact that he fails to realize --

DUCKETT (0S)
Hey -- pal --

Duckett’s talking to him

DUCKETT (CONTD)
Only two choices -- shrimp in mild
sauce and shrimp in hot sauce

Sawyer snaps out of it Swallows

He turns around places a handful of shrimp in a basket
drops the basket in boiling water As he works he speaks
over his shoulder

But as Sawyer stares at him we see his eyes start to waver
Something’s wrong

DUCKETT
(nods )
Love the South Miss the southern
women

Now that Sawyer’s in the moment he’s having second thoughts
Because it’s not that easy to kill a man And we see it play
out on his face

DUCKETT (CONTD)
You in Australia long

SAWYER
Not really

Sawyer wipes the rain out of his eyes Duckett continues
with his business pulling the shrimp out the water

DUCKETT
Well -- fer what it’s worth -- I
run a special here at the truck --
half off for all Americans

He turns around faces Sawyer

You tell him cowboy These
bastards think Americans can’t hold
their liquor

The VOICE comes from the man sitting at the bar next to him
(who at this point is out of frame) Sawyer glances at
him then tosses back his shot --

SAWYER
Again

This time the Bartender fills the glass without protest as
The VOICE (does it sound somehow familiar) comes again --

VOICE (0S)
Hate to put my hand out -- but I
can’t seem to find my wallet Any
way you could

Set him up

In the FOREGROUND the Bartender sets up a glass POURS A

folds around it APPRECIATIVE --

drunk In fact it’s extremely lucid Plain And SAD

I have a son -- about your age
He’s not like me He keeps it
simple does what’s in his heart
A good man Maybe a great one

Right now he thinks I hate him
That I feel betrayed by him But
what I really feel
hard to say)
Is gratitude And pride Because
what he did to me For me It
took more courage than

There’s a payphone over there I
could pick it up call my son And
I could tell him all this

And I could tell him I love him

One simple phone call and I could
fix everything I could take
away his suffering

ON SAWYER Taken by all this Affected by it So he asks
the question we all want the answer to --

SAWYER
Why don’t you

And Shephard knows the answer instantly --

SHEPHARD
Because I’m weak

Shephard picks up the bottle now Pours two more

SHEPHARD (CONTD)
You close with your father

WE’RE CLOSE ON SAWYER as that question lands --

Yeah

Then what are you doing here

SAWYER
It’s not that simple

SHEPHARD
Sure it is
(downs his shot then)
Unless you want to end up like me

ON SAWYER wheels turning What this stranger has just told

him begins to sink in AND MAKES SENSE His face hardens

SAWYER

ACT FOUR
EXT BEACH - DAY 28

THWACK A make-shift machete (made from a sharp piece of
aircraft metal with a wrapped handle) LOPS THE TOP OFF a
coconut husk

WIDEN to reveal Charlie using the machete He’s sitting on
the beach husking coconuts and stacking four or five finished
ones He’s working skillfully but without much enthusiasm

SAYID (0S)
You’re developing quite a talent

Charlie looks up to see Sayid there

CHARLIE

Yeah well you know musical trends
being what they are who knows
what’1ll be popular when we get back
home

(thwack )
Now I’ve got a skill I can fall
back on

He works the latest coconut from its husk and tosses it on
the pile Sayid sits down next to him Charlie turns and
meets Sayid’s concerned stare

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Oh I get it You’re here to check
up on me

SAYID
(simple but without any
judgement)
You killed a man
CHARLIE
A man who killed one of us who
kidnapped Claire -- who strung me
up and left me for dead He
deserved to die -- and I’d do it

again in a minute

THWACK Harder now with the machete This whole little
speech comes out stronger than Charlie intended --

CHARLIE (CONTD)
So pardon me if I’m fresh out of
bad feelings

Sayid nods Then after a beat --

SAYID

When I was in the army in Tikirt
in Iraq the man who lived next
door was a policeman One day his
car was rigged with a bomb It
went off but it missed him -- it
killed his wife and two young
children instead

(beat)
They caught the man who did it

(another beat)
I volunteered to be on the firing
squad And I did my duty without a
single ounce of remorse

Charlie listens to Sayid acting somewhat disinterested --
but the thing is he’s stopped work completely

SAYID (CONTD)
Then for no reason I started
waking up nights Replaying what I
did in my mind

CHARLIE
Looks like you’re the one who needs
checking up on

SAYID
What I’m saying is this what
happened with Ethan will be with
you for the rest of your life

CHARLIE
Meaning an impending lack of sleep

SAYID
More than that

Charlie now meets Sayid’s eyes They bore right into him
Charlie’s try for a casual and slightly flippant attitude is
providing him literally no cover

CHARLIE
Any suggestions

SAYID
(simply)
Youre not alone Don’t pretend to
be

OFF Charlie as that lands with more impact than he thought
EXT JUNGLE - DAY 29

Sawyer and Kate trek through the jungle They push through
the tangled vegetation Kate scanning the ground ahead of
them “cutting for sign”

They are dirty sweaty and breathing hard Sawyer looks
around at the dense bleak jungle as they march forward

SAWYER
I take comfort in knowing
someday this is all gonna be a real
nice shoppin’ complex or maybe an
auto mall

Kate is focused on something else She veers quickly off
their path onto a narrow sliver of trail

SAWYER (CONT’D)
Where ya goin’

Kate stops ahead on the trail because she’s found something
She waits for Sawyer to catch up Which he does

KATE
Know what this is

SAWYER
A hole in the mud

KATE
A wallow

SAWYER KATE
What the hell’s a wa--
-- A boar’s wallow It’s his
den where he sleeps And
look at the tree rubbings
from his tusks

SAWYER

You mean he’s around here

KATE

That’s when Sawyer hears a RUSTLING NOISE

SAWYER

LOST Outlaws (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 121004 51

Sawyer rushes into the bushes following the noise He’s all
AMPED UP URGENT and INTENSE KNOWING he’s damn close to
finding the boar now

KATE
Wait --

Too late We hear RUSTLING BRUSH CRASHING BRANCHES
SNAPPING -- and we HEAR Sawyer GRUNTING SCRAMBLING --

KATE SAWYER (0S)
Sawyer
Gotcha

Followed by an intense SHRIEKING HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAL Kate
starts after him but then the bushes part and Sawyer
reemerges -- holding a BOAR PIGLET

KATE (CONTD)
(deadpan)
I thought it’d be bigger

SAWYER
Funny Now we know daddy’s gotta
be close by

So Sawyer grabs the piglet’s little leg and starts TWISTING
IT The piglet starts to WAIL LIKE A BANSHEE SQUEALING and
YELPING INSANELY

KATE SAWYER
Stop it Sawyer What is the

matter with you
Here PIGGY PIGGY PIGGY --

Stop it Damn it Let it (twisting some more)
go Over here daddy
PUT IT DOWN -- RIGHT NOW Where are ya ‘Cause were

right over here
I said PUT IT DOWN

She tries to grab the piglet but Sawyer twists away from her
so Kate does the only reasonable thing she can do -- she
KICKS SAWYER IN THE ACHILLES TENDON Kicks him HARD

SAWYER (CONTD)
OWWW What are YOU DOIN’

In his weakened state Kate GRABS THE PIGLET from his arms --
and lets it go The piglet hits the ground scrambling for
purchase -- SQUEALING like crazy -- and SCURRIES OFF fast as
its little legs can carry it into the bushes

KATE SAWYER
You’re SICK
I didn’t hurt it

She starts to storm off

KATE
We’re done Game over

SAWYER
What are you talkin’ about --

KATE
Find your own way back

SAWYER
No problem

And she strides away angry as hell OFF Sawyer pissed
watching her go but still on this fucking mission

EXT SHRIMP TRUCK - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 30

RAIN is still FALLING Duckett is closing up his shrimp
truck He hefts a large TRASH BAG carries it to a nearby
DUMPSTER

REVERSE to find Sawyer waiting Now he starts walking
towards Duckett And he’s different No longer nervous No
longer conflicted His conversation with Jack’s dad has him
steeled for what he has to do

As Duckett hefts the garbage bag into the dumpster Sawyer
walks up behind him --

SAWYER
Sawyer --

And as Duckett turns around --
BAM -- Sawyer shoots him Right in the stomach

Duckett DROPS He lands on the ground back against the
dumpster Not quite dead Not yet

Sawyer kneels down next to him Duckett gasps shock
splashed all over his face

Sawyer calmly reaches into his pocket and pulls out his
LETTER (last seen in episode 106)

I got a letter for you

(CONTD) Duckett squirms on the ground holding his stomach life
draining out of him He looks at his hands -- they’re
covered in blood

SAWYER (CONTD)
“Dear Mr Sawyer -- ”

DUCKETT
(coughing)
Who --

And that’s enough to give Sawyer pause

SAWYER
You used to go by the name
Sawyer

Duckett shakes his head losing focus

DUCKETT
The hell you talkin’ about

He coughs looks at his hands again

DUCKETT (CONTD)
You didn’t have to --
(beat)
Tell Hibbs I wouldve

And as soon as Sawyer hears “Hibbs” his face drops

SAWYER
You know Hibbs
(beat)
How do you know Hibbs

But Duckett’s almost gone

DUCKETT
Tell Hibbs I would’ve paid him

SAWYER
(putting it together)
You borrowed money from Hibbs

Duckett coughs looks at Sawyer

DUCKETT
You don’t know what you’re doing
do you
(glassy eyed)
It’1l come back around

LOST Outlaws (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 121004 54
(CONTD) 30
And as he dies he whispers his final words

DUCKETT (CONT’D)
Iwas gonna pay

Sawyer stares at Duckett

And we see it play out on his face He’s been fucking conned

And were CLOSE ON Sawyer when the horror of the full-
realization hits him he’s now a cold-blooded killer

EXT JUNGLE - DAY 31

Sawyer spins around 360 degrees realizes he’s fucked out
here by himself He makes up his mind jams off through the
jungle after Kate pissed but exasperated that she deserted
him

SAWYER
Kate

EXT MORE JUNGLE - DAY - CONTINUOUS 32

Sawyer strides into a more open area looks around trying to
follow the direction she took -- but hell -- he doesn’t know
-- and she’s nowhere in sight

SAWYER
C’mon Kate Where are y--

Suddenly he stops short Even backs up a step or two
because standing right in his path is the fucking BOAR That
big one The one he’s been hunting

Sawyer draws his gun

The boar doesn’t move -- doesn’t go anywhere Instead its
head turns and A BIG BROWN EYE stares over at Sawyer

Sawyer looks out over his outstretched gun stares right
back at the boar

Now we see KATE step INTO VIEW behind Sawyer But he
doesn’t see her

Instead for the longest moment Sawyer and the fucking boar
have a STARE-OFF They look at each other

And from the intense expression on Sawyer’s face we’re just
waiting for him to pull the trigger

LOST Outlaws (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 121004 55

(CONTD) 32

But he doesn’t Instead he lowers the gun

The BOAR waits a final beat watching him then turns and
walks off into the brush

Sawyer stands there gun hanging down at his side trying to
collect himself

Now he senses something -- turns to see Kate watching him
SEES that she saw the whole thing -- and in her face is an
appreciation for what he just did Except Sawyer DOESN’T
WANT IT He walks right back past her Meets her eyes for
only the briefest of moments to say --

SAWYER (CONTD)
(shrugs )
It’s just a boar
(as he goes)
Let’s get back to camp

Kate takes this in then walks after him drawn toward this
complicated troubled soul Because she is one herself

CUT TO BLACK

the beach

KATE
»a deal’s a deal

SAWYER
The deal was for toiletries --

KATE
“Carte blanche” Whatever I want
And I want the gun

And now we see they are being observed by Jack much further
down the beach Way out of earshot and they do not see him
but he SEES them returning together and takes note

BACK ON SAWYER AND KATE

SAWYER
I didn’t kill the damn hog --

KATE
I said I’d help you find it We
found it

Sawyer stops in his tracks realizing something

SAWYER
Jack asked me for the gun two days
ago
(beat cold)

That why you came on this trek --
to do your doctor boyfriend a
favor

She meets his gaze not giving him an inch
KATE
You needed help I helped You
don’t like the deal
(beat)
Not my problem
As Sawyer stares at her jaw set mulling this

34 EXT BEACH - DUSK 34

themselves

A JOY she is trying to connect to

CHARLIE

Claire turns to see CHARLIE

CLAIRE

CHARLIE
Wanna go for that walk

Claire looks at him Sees him trying to reestablish their
connection

CLAIRE

He helps her up and they walk off together down the beach --
EXT OUTSIDE THE VALLEY - DUSK 35
AS JACK moves some gear we hear a voice behind him say

SAWYER (0S)
Stick ‘em up

Jack turns around FINDS SAWYER his gun actually pointing up

atJack from his hip OUTLAW STYLE Jack regards him then

JACK
You trying to be funny

SAWYER
Yeah But I was fresh out of pies
to throw atcha

And we sit in this tableau for just a few moments longer
Despite the smile on Sawyer’s face it’s TENSE And it’s a
reminder that these two are not big fans of one another

Finally Sawyer turns the gun around extends it to Jack --
who to say the least is SURPRISED by the gesture --

SAWYER (CONTD)
Here ya go Sheriff

JACK

I asked you for this two days ago --
SAWYER

-- and I told you to stick it

(beat)
Guess I had a change of heart

SAWYER turns starts heading out of the cave We’re on him
as we see Jack in the background ask

JACK
Whatd she give you

Sawyer turns around locks eyes with him

SAWYER
Sorry

JACK
(don’t fucking play with
me asshole)
Kate What’d she give you

Sawyer considers this Reads a hint of Jack’s jealousy here
And then He GRINS --

SAWYER
Nothin’ she wasn’t willing to part
with

Jack shakes his head Not gonna take the bait Turns his
back on Sawyer resumes with his gear --

Sawyer’s grin WIDENS pleased with himself as he again turns
to go -- And he BARELY hears Jack mutter to himself --

JACK

That’s why the Sox’1ll never win the
series

Sawyer freezes Turns back --

SAWYER
Whatd you just say

Jack keeps his back to Sawyer continuing with his GEAR --

LOST Outlaws (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 121004 59
(CONTD) 35

JACK
Huh

SAWYER
Whatd you just say

JACK
I said “Thats why the Red Sox will
never win the Series”

SAWYER
What the hell does --

JACK
Something my dad used to say So
he could go through life knowing
people hated him Instead of
taking responsibility he put it on
fate Said he was made that way

ON SAWYER as the synapses fire Connections are made
Revelations are realized He can’t fucking believe it

SAWYER
Your daddy -- He a doctor too

JACK
He was He’s dead

Then it occurs to Jack that he’s actually having this
conversation with Sawyer He stops turns back to him --

JACK (CONTD)
Why do you want to know about my
father

AND WE HOLD ON Sawyer for a LONG BEAT -- REAL LONG And
here’s his opportunity to let Jack off the hook To end his
suffering To tell Jack his father didn’t blame him for what
happened To tell him his father did take responsibility for
his actions To tell Jack his father LOVED HIM

And finally --

SAWYER
No reason

Oh Fuck

And ON SAWYER -- wondering how he can have more compassion
for a fucking boar than he can for this man
