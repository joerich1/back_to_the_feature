Now we cant take every Nazi in
this country to trial although I
would like to its an
impossibility So were going for
the big boys in industry education

STEVE
Like this bandleader

WALLACE

(a smile)
Well hes more than just a
bandleader Steve Hes a great
conductor a gifted artist But we
believe that he sold himself to
the devil Your number one priority
from this moment on is to connect
him to the Nazi Party Dont be
impressed by him I want the folks
back home to understand why we
fought this war Find Wilhelm
Furtwangler guilty He represents
everything that was rotten in
Germany

Steve wants to rise but Wallace puts a hand on his

shoulder
to make him sit again

other stuff that Id like for you
to see here Background
He nods to the projectionist then starts to go but
stops

WALLACE
Oh one thing that may be a problem
Our Occupation Authorities in
Wiesbaden have a duty to help these
poor unfortunates with their
defence They keep repeating We
must be just we must be seen to
be just Well Ive only one thing
to say to the liberals in Wiesbaden

separate Ill remember that But

Schlee tries to find words

SCHLEE
Well its hard to explain I can
only tell you from my own
experience Soon after I joined
the orchestra we were rehearsing
the Third Symphony of Beethoven
the Eroica There are several rather
difficult passages for the timpani
One particular crescendo During
the break I asked how he wanted
it played He was studying his
score He didnt look up He said
Just watch me So of course I
did I never stopped watching him
The moment came And suddenly he
turned to me and our eyes were
locked There was something in his

look that that simply demanded
the crescendo I shall never forget
his look It was a moment of of
magic

Steve nods thinks for a moment Then

STEVE
You ever seen Adolf Hitlers eyes
when he was making a speech Ive
seen em on films

SCHLEE
Yes

STEVE
Was looking at Furtwangler like
that

chest with his

thumb )
And I said Dr Furtwangler why
not enter with the baton in your
right hand Hitler will be sitting
in the front row If you give the
salute with the baton in your right
hand itll look like youre going
to poke his eyes out

a Prussian Privy Councillor How
did that happen to a non-Party
member

FURTWANGLER
I received a telegram from Hermann
Goering informing me that he had
made me a Privy Councillor I was
not given the opportunity either
to accept or refuse After the
dreadful events of November 1938
the violent attacks on the Jews I
stopped using the title

STEVE
What about Vice-President of the
Chamber of Music you used that
title didnt you But then I suppose
you had no choice there either
because I suppose Dr Goebbels

just sent you a telegram saying
Dear Mr Vice-President

FURTWANGLER
I dont think Dr Goebbels sent me
a telegram I was simply told In
a letter I believe I dont
remember exactly

STEVE
Goebbels and Goering were sure
heaping honours on you One makes
you a Privy Councillor the other
makes you Vice-President of the
Chamber of Music and you werent
even a member of the Party how do
you explain that

FURTWANGLER
Well there was a constant battle
between Goering and Goebbels as to
which of them would control German
culture I was simply a pawn
Anyway I resigned from the
Musikkammer at the same time I
resigned as Musical Director of
the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra
In 1934

David puts up a hand Steve nods

DAVID
Why was that Why did you resign
Dr Furtwangler

FURTWANGLER
I wrote an open letter to the
newspapers condemning what they
were doing to music making these
distinctions between Jews and non-
Jews For my part the only divide
in art is between good and bad
Eventually Goebbels summoned me
and told me I could leave the
country if I wanted to but under
no condition would I ever be allowed
to return I always believe that
you have to fight from the inside
not from without I asked myself
whats the duty of an artist to
stay or to leave And then Goebbels
demanded that I acknowledge Hitler
as solely responsible for cultural
policy Well that was a fact and
it seemed pointless to deny it I
simply acknowledged that Hitler
and the Minister of Culture
appointed by him were solely
responsible for the cultural policy
of the Reich What I wanted to
express was that I personally

had no responsibility whatsoever
for their cultural policy I have
always had the view that art and
politics should should have
nothing to do with each other

STEVE
Then why did you conduct at one of
their Nuremberg rallies

FURTWANGLER
(flaring)
I did not conduct at at the rally
I conducted on the evening before
the rally

STEVE
That sounds like the small print
in one of our insurance policies
Wilhelm And what about April 19
1942 The eve of Hitlers fifty-
third birthday the big celebration
you conducted for Hitler didnt
you Was that in keeping with your
view that art and politics have
nothing to do with each other

FURTWANGLER
(flustered)
That that was a different matter
I I was tricked
STEVE
How come
FURTWANGLER

Could I have a glass of water
please Please Fraulein
EMMI
Straube

Steve looks expectant but Furtwangler remains silent
Steve

nods to Emmi who gets the water Furtwangler drinks

Steve waits

FURTWAANGLER
Thank you I was in Vienna
rehearsing the Ninth Symphony of
Beethoven when Goebbels called
and said I had to conduct at
Hitlers birthday Id always
managed to wriggle out of such
invitations pleading previous
engagements illness having my
doctors state I was not well and
so on and so on I was also
fortunate that Baldur von Shirach
who controlled Vienna hated Dr
Goebbels and would do anything to
thwart his wishes But this time
Goebbels got to my doctors before
me they were frightened off and
von Schirach was threatened bullied
and gave in So I had no
alternative but to conduct for
Hitler Believe me I knew I had
compromised and I deeply regret
it

STEVE

(playing with him)

Doesnt sound much of a trick to
me Sounds like you made a deal

FURTWANGLER
I made no deal

STEVE
I dont buy that

FURTWANGLER
Its the truth

Silence Steve paces Then suddenly turns on
Furtwangler

STEVE
I keep hearing you helped a lot of
Jews to escape How did you do
that

FURTWANGLER
I dont remember in detail there
were so many

STEVE
Did you call someone you knew

FURTWANGLER
I may have as as I said I
simply dont remember

STEVE

Let me me help you then You picked
up the phone and made a call -

(Mimes a telephone)
Hello Adolf Wilhelm speaking
Listen old pal theres a Jew-boy
musician I want you to help He
needs a permit to get to Paris

Emmi sticks her fingers in her ears and shuts her eyes
tight

STEVE
Or maybe you called Goebbels or
Goering You were so close you
were in the same shithouse as them

FURTWANGLER
May I ask a question

STEVE
Sure

FURTWANGLER
When will my case be heard by the
Tribunal

STEVE

Your guess is as good as mine

FURTWANGLER
I need to work I need to make my
living I live off the generosity
of friends

STEVE
Tough tough
FURTWANGLER

(now more and more

agitated)
Then why is it please that another
conductor who was actually a member
of the Party who used to play the
Horst Wessel before his concerts
has already been cleared and is
working again while I have to wait
and wait and wait

STEVE
I dont know he wasnt my case
Why did you escape to Switzerland
just before the war ended

FURTWANGLER
It was because I learned that the
Gestapo was about to arrest me

STEVE
Why were they going to arrest you

FURTWANGLER
I believe it was because of another
letter Id written to Goebbels
lamenting the decline of musical
standards due to racial policies

STEVE
You didnt complain about the racial
policies just about the musical
standards is that right

No response

STEVE
So how did you learn that the
Gestapo was out to get you

FURTWANGLER
During an enforced hour-long
interval because of a power failure
at a concert here in Berlin Albert
Speer the Minister of Armaments
said to me You look very tired
Dr Furtwangler you should go
abroad for a while I knew exactly
what he meant

STEVE
You sure knew a lot of people in
high places

FURTWANGLER
It would be truer to say I think
that a lot of people in high places
knew me

STEVE

You were real close to all of them
to Adolf to Hermann to Joseph
to Baldur and now Albert

(flaring)
So lets hear the truth lets
come clean What was your Party
number

FURTWANGLER
If you are going to bully me like
this Major you had better do
your homework You obviously have
no idea how impertinent and stupid
your questions are

Steve is stung His eyes narrow dangerously

STEVE
David you remember I said I had a
question that he wouldnt be able
to answer Well Im gonna ask it
now You ready for this Wilhelm
Its a tough one Why didnt you
get out right at the start when
Hitler came to power in 1933 Why
didnt you leave Germany

No response

STEVE
I have a list of names here people
in your profession who got out in
33 Bruno Walter Otto Klemperer
Arnold Schoenberg Max Reinhardt

FURTWANGLER

They were Jews they had to leave
They were right to leave

(He breathes deeply

summons strength)
I could not leave my country in
her deepest misery After all I
am a German I I stayed in my
homeland Is that my sin in your
the

eyes

STEVE
See David He cant answer the
question Ill ask it again
Wilhelm and dont give me any

FURTWANGLER
I wasnt told I just knew it

STEVE
How

FURTWANGLER
(uneasy)
I was warned
STEVE
Who warned you

FURTWANGLER
(lowering his head)
Goering Because Hinkel was working
for Goebbels

STEVE
What did Goering say

FURTWANGLER
He told me to be careful as one of
Goebbels men was watching me He
read a report on me - everything I
said was quoted word by word

STEVE
Oh boy youre gonna love this
Take your time with this now Those
files contain the details of every
working artist in this country
Those files are gonna tell us who
joined the Party who informed and
who was helpful

Furtwangler goes to the door David opens it for him

STEVE
I was in Vienna I had with me an
Austrian chauffeur Max his name
was he spent time in the camps
We were looking at these Viennese
cleaning up the bomb damage
scavenging for rotting food butt

pours

does

entered the city a million of
em and now look at em And
Max said Oh not these people
Major These people were all at
home hiding Jews in their attics
You get the point Colonel The
point is theyre all full of shit

DYMSHITZ

out of here when he had the chance

Toscanini

Dymshitz pours vodkas raises his glass drinks So
Steve Now their moods swing with the drink

Dymshitz drinks then sits sinks into his own world

Perhaps perhaps he believed he

could at least try to preserve
something important things like

an orchestra a school Thats his
country Maybe he has an old mother
who cant be left alone Maybe he
has brothers sisters you
cant

A forlorn look at Steve His eyes are misty he is
visibly
drunk

STEVE
(a wry smile)
Colonel He had no sisters no
brothers only a lot of love
affairs

DYMSHITZ
Anyway Major why should he leave
his country his mother tongue
his family his history his past
his future just because now
suddenly there is a dictatorship

Why

STEVE
But what before that turns
rotten What if they surround

the space with barbed wire Colonel

DYMSHITZ
(suddenly exploding)
Dont talk about things you know
nothing about He was ina
dictatorship

STEVE
(dismissive)
Yeah yeah art and politics yeah
yeah I heard all about that

DYMSHITZ
(angry)

In a dictatorship art belongs to
the Party If you want to be a
conductor you have to have an
orchestra And you can only get an
orchestra if you have contact with
the power All over the world you
need the right contacts and you
have to make the right compromises
STEVE
This is what Im saying He must

INT STEVES OFFICE - NIGHT

Drunk Steve is clumsily almost frantically threading
film into the 16-mm projector

He switches off the lights then stumbles back to the
projector turns it on and directs its beam towards a

square of watt
Its an American military propaganda film

EXT FLEA MARKET - DAY
Bright summers day Emmi pushing her way through the
crowded market She comes to the stall with gramophone

records

David is with her staying behind a little so as not to
disturb her

She starts to look through the records blowing her
from time to time Then she finds a box of records
it is delighted She bargains with the stallholder
she hands over money

She shows her purchase to David happily They struggle
in the crowd David suddenly stops He has spotted a
The bicycle with two seats is old and rusty but seems
be in working order David steps up to it touches it
EXT WOODLAND - DAY

Two persons Emmi and David riding the tandem Emmi in
the front pedalling David behind The road going up

the hills is full of potholes They change seats David
in the front Emmi at the back Suddenly the road

to descend They change again Emmi sits in the front
David at the back They speed down the hill

INT BURNT-OUT DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

The tandem ridden by Emmi and David rolls into a huge
building black and burnt out

In the middle of the vast hall surrounded by the
Furtwanglers

desk

to

there is a Christmas tree almost burnt to cinder Emmi
and David stare at it mesmerised

DAVID
Yesterday I read that Furtwangler
was asked to lead the New York
Philharmonic back in 36 Toscanini
suggested it Had he accepted he
would have become the most
celebrated conductor in America

EMMI
When he made his decision he
couldnt have known everything
Especially not the way people like
you do whove returned from exile
and feel that you have a right to
pass judgement Because you are
blameless you think you know best
who is a sinner and who deserves
forgiveness But you have no idea
how people lived here

DAVID
When he met Hitler at his birthday
and shook hands with him was he
pleased

EMMI
I dont know But you and I already
know that he has saved lives
INT STEVES OFFICE - DAY
Steve and David studying files in silence
baton is on Steves desk Steve drinks black coffee

Emmi enters Curt nods of greeting She goes to her

then takes the Bruckner record to Steve Steve looks at
the record then glances up at Emmi He does his best

exclude David who tries to hear what is said
Emmi glances at David Shes embarrassed

EMMI
Bruckners Seventh Major

STEVE
Do you know where the Adagio begins
EMMI
Of course

STEVE
Put it on ready to play and Ill
tell you when to play it

He returns to his desk Emmi looks through the album

for
the appropriate record
INT STEVES OFFICE - DAY
Steve by the open window looking at his wristwatch
smoking
a cigarette David and Emmi both watch him The door
opens
and Furtwangler bursts in
FURTWANGLER
It is now nine oclock precisely
I do not intend to be kept waiting
again
STEVE
(dangerously calm)
Dont talk to me like I was a second
violinist Go back into the waiting
room Miss Straube will come and
get you when I am ready to see
you
Furtwangler goes out
STEVE
Jesus God who the hell does he
think he is Who the hell does he
think he is
David and Emmi gaze at him as he tries to regain
control
INT WAITING ROOM - DAY
The door to the landing is open and Rode is there
pretending
to sweep He looks in to see Furtwangler sitting
holding

his handkerchief over his nose and mouth

RODE
Would you perhaps like to have a
glass of water Herr Professor

Furtwangler doesnt seem to hear Rode hesitates then
continues to sweep

INT STEVES OFFICE - DAY
David and Emmi look at him puzzled

She goes to the door opens it nods Rode quickly
disappears Furtwangler looks at Emmi

FURTWANGLER
What is this man doing here

Emmi doesnt answer All eyes on the door Furtwangler
enters

STEVE
Dr Furtwangler Come in come
in sit down

Furtwangler deeply suspicious goes for the

uncomfortable
chair
STEVE
No no take this one its more
comfortable
He holds the other chair for Furtwangler who sits
STEVE
If its too hot open your tie
FURTWANGLER
(interrupting)
I wish to say something
STEVE
Go ahead be my guest
Furtwangler takes from his pocket a piece of paper with
notes He blows his nose The room is warming up It
will

become like an airless court room a pressure cooker

FURTWANGLER
When I last saw you I was
unprepared I did not know what to
expect In these past weeks I
have been thinking more carefully
and making some notes

(glances at the

notes)
You have to understand who I am
and what I am I am a musician and
I believe in music I am an artist
and I believe in art Art in
general and music in particular
has for me mystical powers which
nurture mans spiritual needs I
must confess however to being
extremely naive I insisted for
many years on the absolute
separation of art and politics My
entire life was devoted to music
because and this is very important
because I thought that I could
through music do something
practical

STEVE
And what was that

FURTWANGLER
Maintain liberty humanity and
justice

STEVE
Gee thats a thing of beauty
honest to God a real thing of
beauty Im going to try to remember
that Liberty humanity and justice
Beautiful But you used the word
naive Are you now saying you
think you were wrong That art and
politics cant be separated

FURTWANGLER
I believe art and politics should
be separate but that they werent
kept separate I learned to my cost

STEVE
And when did you first learn that -
when you sent the telegram Was
that the surrender signal the
waving of the white flag

FURTWANGLER
What telegram
STEVE
Happy birthday dear Adolf love
Wilhelm Or words to that effect
That sounds to me like you were
dropping on your knees and saying
Okay Adolf you win Youre the
number one man Have a swell party

FURTWANGLER
I have no idea what youre talking
about

STEVE

The birthday greetings you sent to
your old pal Adolf Hider

FURTWANGLER
I never sent him any birthday
greetings or any other kind of
greetings

STEVE
Think carefully Wilhelm maybe
not in your own name but as Privy
Councillor or Vice-President

FURTWANGLER
I dont have to think carefully
This is utterly ridiculous

David and Emmi exchange the briefest of looks David
raises
his hand

STEVE
Yes David

DAVID
Why not show Dr Furtwangler the
evidence It may refresh his memory

FURTWANGLER
You wont find it because no such
telegram exists

STEVE
Well I tried you got to admit I
tried I thought I might just trap
you there Wilhelm but David here
was too quick for me Smart move
David smart move No I dont
have the telegram but I know it
exists And I want you to know
Wilhelm were going to keep looking
for it because I believe you sent
it

FURTWANGLER
Then you are wrong

STEVE
Art and politics yeah art and
politics Lets look at that You
and the Berlin Philharmonic toured
the Third Reich played in countries
the Nazis had conquered Are you
saying that conducting in occupied
territories from 1939 on wasnt a
commercial for Adolf and all he
stood for

FURTWANGLER
We never never officially
represented the regime when we
played abroad We always performed
as a private ensemble As I think
I already told you I was a
freelance conductor

STEVE
You know something You shouldve
written our insurance policies for
us because you got more exclusion
clauses than Double Indemnity
What do you imagine people thought
The Berlin Philharmonics taken
over by Doctor Goebbels and his
Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is
a freelance so art and politics
are now entirely separate Is that
what you believed ordinary people
thought

FURTWANGLER
have no idea what ordinary people
thought

STEVE
No

FURTWANGLER
No because I had only one
intention My only intention
whatever I did was to show that
music means more than politics

STEVE
Tell me about von der Null

FURTWANGLER
(taken off-guard)
Von der Null

STEVE
Yes von der Null

FURTWANGLER
Von der Null

STEVE
How longs this going to go on
Wilhelm I say von der Null you
say von der Null I say von der
Null you say von der Null we
could go on all day You know who
von der Null is dont you Edwin
von der Nuell music critic

FURTWANGLER
Yes I know who he is

STEVE
Isnt it true that because he gave
you bad reviews and praised this
young guy Von Karajan called him
a goddamn miracle said he was a
better conductor than you then
you had von der Null conscripted
into the army and no ones heard
from him since

FURTWANGLER
Thats an outrageous lie

STEVE
You sure you didnt call one of
your close buddies and say God in
heaven did you see what that guy
von der Null wrote about me The
greatest conductor on earth I
want him out the way He had the
nerve to accuse me I am not playing
enough modern music Send him to
Stalingrad Isnt that what you
did You dont like criticism do
you Wilhelm You surely didnt
like them saying there was another
conductor who was better than you
Are you saying the name von der
Null was never mentioned in your
talks with Goebbels

FURTWANGLER
(uncomfortable)
Well Once he said hed read what
this man wrote about me

STEVE
And what did he say

FURTWANGLER
He said Dont mind him His job
is to criticise your job is to
conduct

STEVE
And what happened to Von der Nul

FURTWANGLER
I have no idea

STEVE
Youve really no idea Ill tell
you what happened He died in
Stalingrad

FURTWANGLER
Im sorry

STEVE

Now that young conductor whats
his name

(playing with

Furtwangler)
That miracle kid you know who I
mean Von Karajan But you called
him something else Cmon What
did you call von Karajan

Silence

STEVE
Say it

Silence

STEVE
Ill say it then Little K Is
that right You couldnt even bear
to say his name

Furtwangler rises angrily and starts to pace

FURTWANGLER
Please stop playing these games
with me Why you should bring up
the name of another conductor is
beyond my understanding

STEVE
Ill tell you why You remember we
talked about you playing for
Hitlers birthday And you told
me that Goebbels got to your doctors
first that you were tricked

FURTWANGLER
Yes thats what happened

He sits heavily wipes his brow He is sweating now

STEVE
I have a different story to tell
I dont think you were tricked
Not in the way you describe I
believe something else happened
Ive seen the Hinkel Archive Ive
seen records of phone calls and
putting it all together this is
what I think happened I think
Goebbels said Wilhelm if you
wont conduct for Adolfs birthday
well get the Miracle Kid the guy
that critic von der Null thinks
is the greatest conductor in the
world Hes not just willing to
conduct for Adolf hes offered to
sing Happy Birthday as a solo

Silence

STEVE
Come on admit it K worried you
didnt he He always worried you
In 1942 hes thirty-four years
old youre already fifty-six And
Goebbels and Goering keep saying
to you If you dont do it little
K will Never mind art and politics
and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit
about liberty humanity and justice
because I dont care how great you
are Its the oldest story in the
book

(a wry look at David)
The ageing Romeo jealous of the
young buck The real reason you
didnt leave the country when you
new you should have was that you
were frightened that once you
were out of the way youd be
supplanted by the Miracle Kid the
Partys boy twice over flashy
talented little K

fq

FURTWANGLER
This is absolute nonsense

fq

STEVE
Well Im just beginning to develop
my theme Isnt that what you call
it in classical music developing
your theme Okay so they played
on your insecurity Thats human
understandable But there is one
guy who doesnt like little K as
much as he likes you - yeah the
number one man your old pal Adolf
He thinks youre the greatest and
when he says I want Wilhelm for
my birthday boy they better go
out get Wilhelm So Josef calls
and threatens you with little K
And you said to hell with the Ninth
in Vienna Ill give it to Adolf
as a birthday present in Berlin
Thats the trick they played they
got you by the balls and they
squeezed Hard Why did you stay
Why did you play for them Why
were you the flag-carrier for their
regime Jealousy

FURTWANGLER
(interrupting)
Of course there was a conspiracy
against me a campaign - even

abroad
Brief silence all eyes on him

STEVE
You see Wilhelm Im talking about
ordinary everyday reasons Which

is why I want to discuss your
private life How many illegitimate
children do you have

DAVID
Major I dont see how this line
of questioning could

STEVE
David what are you Counsel for
the Defence now (
(to Furtwangler)
Did you hear the question

FURTWANGLER
(barely audible)
I have illegitimate children

STEVE
What

FURTWANGLER
I said I have illegitimate children
I dont know how many

STEVE
You like the women dont you
Wilhelm
No response
STEVE

Isnt it true that before every
concert you got a woman in your
dressing room and gave her the old
conductors baton isnt that true

DAVID
(indicating EmmI)
Major this is deeply offensive
and repugnant

STEVE
You bet

DAVID
and totally irrelevant

STEVE
(continuing to
Furtwangler)
Not so Counsellor That secretary
of yours she wasnt just your
secretary she procured women for
you didnt she As many and as
often as you wanted

FURTWANGLER
Stop this please stop this now

STEVE
No Im not going to stop it Hitler
himself offered you a beautiful
house and a personal bomb shelter

FURTWANGLER
I absolutely refused the house and
the bomb shelter

STEVE
But you see what Im getting at
You get a gorgeous house youre
highly paid What are you gonna
do stay or leave One voice comes
back at me stay

DAVID
Major thats not a good argument
If Dr Furtwangler did indeed enjoy
all these these privileges he
enjoyed them because of who he is
and what he is Thats true of any
leading artist in any country in
the world

STEVE
But it still doesnt make them
saints They still have to get up
and piss in the middle of the night
dont they They can still be
vindictive and envious and mean
just like you and me Well just
like me Cant they

No response To Furtwangler

STEVE
Okay Wilhelm go home now Go
home and think about these past
twelve years

FURTWANGLER
I dont understand what you mean

STEVE
No thats your problem Wilhelm
You understand nothing Well call
you Go

Furtwangler leaves

DAVID
Major

Steve goes to his desk and as Furtwangler rises
uncertainly

STEVE
What

DAVID
Your manner

STEVE

My manner Why dont you go
downstairs get a cup of coffee
and calm down Whats the matter
Emmi Whats going on with you
Whats wrong

EMMI
Im sorry but I have to leave
Ill find other work Youll have
to get someone else thats all

STEVE
What is this Emmi

EMMI
I cant do this Its not right

STEVE
Whats not right

EMMI
I have been questioned by the
Gestapo just like that Just like
you questioned him

STEVE
Emmi stop I want to show you
something Let me show you something
and then if you want to leave you
can leave please please His
friends they did this And he
gave them birthday concerts

EMMI
But he had no idea a lot of people
had no idea I only realised what
was really going on when I got
arrested

STEVE
If he had no idea why did the
Jews need saving This is the
question Emmi to all Germans
Why did the Jews need saving in
this country Why if people had
no idea

EMMI
I would like to go now please

But Steve turns on the projector and the Bergen-Belsen
film flickers into life

INT US OFFICERS CLUB - NIGHT

Band playing Couples dancing David and Steve at the
bar

each with a drink in front of them lost in their own

thoughts Then

Steve signs to the barkeeper to fill their glasses but
David puts a hand over his glass Then

DAVID
Can I ask you a favour Major

STEVE
Yeah

DAVID
When you question him again could
you treat him with more respect

STEVE
With more what More what

DAVID
Major he may just be the greatest
conductor of this century and that
merits respect

STEVE
(flaring hissing)
David I dont understand a thing
about you Youre a Jew Are you a
Jew

DAVID
Yes Im a Jew But I like to think
first Im a human being

STEVE
A human being oh good Im
relieved I thought you were going
to say you were a music lover
This man this great artist has
made anti-Semitic remarks like you
wouldnt believe I got letters

DAVID
Major show me someone who hasnt
made an anti-Semitic remark and
Ill show you the gates of paradise

STEVE
(over-reacting and
overlapping)
What is it with you David Where
are your feelings Wheres your
hatred your disgust Wheres your
fucking outrage David

He starts to go then comes back to them

STEVE
Think of your parents David and
then think of him conducting Happy
Birthday dear Adolf I mean for
Chrissake whose side are you on
Grow up Just grow the fuck up

The customers stare at him as he stalks out The band
plays

CUT

office May I come in If you are
Emmi

INT

Hot

there you can influence what
happens What good can you do by
leaving If you go you are giving
up and how can you help Furtwangler
or me Dont think about leaving
Stay

STEVES OFFICE - DAY

Windows closed Furtwangler seated David and

present Steve looks up from his notes

STEVE

Everybody says what a great
benefactor you were to the Jews
But--

(holds up a sheaf

of papers)
I have things here you said and
wrote Listen to this The Jew
composer Schonberg is admired by
the Jewish International And
what about this Jewish musicians
lack a genuine affinity with our
music Jewish musicians are good
businessmen with few scruples
lacking roots You deny you said
these things

FURTWANGLER
Those attitudes do not exist in
me

STEVE

believe that But just answer
the question dont give me
explanations

FURTWANGLER
Speaking to Party members I used
their language of course I did
everyone did

DAVID
(with some irony)
Major sorry to interrupt but
maybe we have to maybe we have
to balance those things against
his assistance to his Jewish
colleagues
Steve tenses

DAVID
This is a transcript of the
proceedings at Nuremberg
A Swedish businessman Birger
Dahlerus testified in cross-
examination that he had several
meetings with Hermann Goering I
first saw Goering Dahlerus
testified embroiled in a stormy
interview with Wilhelm Furtwangler
the famous conductor of the Berlin
Philharmonic who was vainly seeking
permission to keep his Jewish
concert master

Holds up his package of letters and dumps them on
Emmis
desk

DAVID
Emmi pick one of these any one
read it out loud

Emmi is uncertain Steve shrugs indifferently
She picks an envelope and takes out the letter

EMMI
(reading)

Please remember that Dr
Furtwangler risked his life to
help anyone who asked him I
personally testify to having seen
literally hundreds of people lined
up outside his dressing room after
concerts to ask for his help He
never turned anyone away After he
heard me play I ama violinist
he gave me money because I was
unable to feed myself or my family
and then he helped me to escape to
Sweden He helped countless people
in similar ways

DAVID
And this only one of these letters
Major I have lots of them

STEVE
(smiling)
How many times have I got to tell
you I was in insurance You think
I cant smell a phoney policy when
its shoved under my nose Sure
he helped Jews but that was just
insurance his cover because all
the while he was maestro of all he
surveyed

(turning on

Furtwangler)
See Wilhelm I think youre their
boy their creature You were like
an advertising slogan for them
this is what we produce the
greatest conductor in the world
And you went along with it The
truth of the matter is Wilhelm
you didnt need to be a member of
the Party I made a mistake when I
asked you for your Party number I
shouldve asked you for your non-
Party number Just like some other
well-known artists

(suddenly to Emmi)
Emmi put that record on

Emmi puts on the record of the Adagio from Bruckners
Seventh Symphony After a moment

STEVE
Do you know what that is

FURTWANGLER
Of course I know what that is

STEVE
Okay so what is it

FURTWANGLER
Bruckners Seventh The Adagio

STEVE
Whos conducting

FURTWANGLBR
I am

STEVE
You know the last time it was played
on these air waves

FURTWANGLER
How can I know such a thing

STEVE
Ill tell you then The last time
this music was played on these air
waves was after they announced
that your pal Hitler had shot
himself Listen to it They listen
Did they pick little Ks recording
Did they pick some other conductor
No they picked you and why
Because you represented them so
beautifully When the Devil died
they wanted his bandleader to
conduct the funeral march You
were everything to them

The music plays

FURTWANGLER

(near to breakdown

but struggling for

control)
I have always tried to analyse
myself carefully and closely In
staying here I believed I walked
a tightrope between exile and the
gallows You seem to be blaming me
for not having allowed myself to
be hanged

David takes the record off

FURTWANGLER
I didnt directly oppose the Party
because I told myself that was
not my job If I had taken any
active part in politics I could
not have remained here But as a
musician I am more than a citizen
I am a citizen of this country in
that eternal sense to which the
genius of great music testifies I
know that a single performance of
a great masterpiece was a stronger
and more vital negation of the
spirit of Buchenwald and Auschwitz
than words

An uncontrollable surge of anger wells up in Steve
causing
desk

half

physically

him to pace alarmingly He grabs the baton from his

stands trembling before Furtwangler and snaps it in

He pushes his face close to Furtwangler who recoils
terrified David half-stands ready to intervene

During this Emmi puts her fingers in her ears

STEVE

(quiet terrifying)
Have you ever smelled burning flesh
I smelt it four miles away Four
miles away I smelt it Have you
ever seen the gas chambers the
crematoria Have you seen the mounds
of rotting corpses You talk to me
about culture art and music You
putting that in the scales Wilhelm
You setting culture art and music
against the millions put to death
by your pals They had orchestras
in the camps They played Beethoven
Wagner The hangmen were playing
chamber music at home with their
families I dont understand the
Germans relationship with music
What do you need music for Your
pals you could call to save a few
Jews when millions of them were
being annihilated Yes I blame
you for not getting hanged I blame
you for your cowardice You strutted
and swaggered you fucking piece
of shit king-pin in a shithouse
You talk to me about walking a
tightrope between exile and the
gallows and I say to you lies

FURTWANGLER
(breaking down)
I love my country I believe in
music what was I to do

STEVE
Look around you See the country
you served Look at people who had
real courage who took risks who
risked their lives Like Emmis
father
stands

window

He sees Emmi has her fingers in her ears yells at her

STEVE
Emmi take your fingers out of
your ears

She does so

STEVE
Im talking about your father

She screams Stillness All eyes on her

EMMI
My father only joined the plot
when he realised that we could not
win the war She cries quietly

FURTWANGLER

(desperate)
What kind of a world do you want
Major What kind of world are you
going to make Do you honestly
believe that the only reality is
the material world so you will be
left nothing nothing but

feculence more foul-smelling
than that which pervades your
nights

(near to breakdown)
How was I to understand how was I
to know what they were capable of
No one knew No one knew

He breaks down buries his face in his hands weeps
FURTWANGLER
I dont want to stay in this
country Yes I should have left
in 1934 it would have been better
if Id left
He is suddenly overtaken by nausea and faintness

a hand to his mouth Emmi goes to him

STEVE
Get him out of here

Emmi helps Furtwangler out Steve strides to the

opens it puts his head out into the fresh air
INT WAITING ROOM - DAY

Emmi helps Furtwangler to a chair She watches him
solicitously He breathes deeply

FURTWANGLER
Thank you Fraulein You have been
most kind
(he rises)
He smiles at her She is
embarrassed

INT STEVES OFFICE - DAY

Steve is trying to get a number on the telephone David

is

packing up his papers

David turns to the records starts to son through until
he

finds what hes looking for He removes the Bruckner
and

puts another record on the turntable

STEVE

(into the telephone)
Major Arnold Get me General
Wallace General Major Arnold
about Furtwangler I dont know if
weve got a case thatll stand up
but sure as hell we can give him a
hard time

At full volume the sound of the subdued opening of
Beethovens Ninth Symphony

STEVE
(to David)

Hey turn that down would you
Cant you see Im on the phone
(into the telephone)

Never mind we got a journalist
wholl do whatever we tell him

But David ignores him sits implacable listening
INT STEVES BUILDING - DAY

Furtwangler walks slowly down the stairs a broken man
struggling to regain his composure Emmi watches him
INT STEVES OFFICE - DAY

The music at full blast David at an open window

keeps
his back to Steve still on the telephone
STEVE
Turn it off
EXT STEVE S BUILDING - DAY
Furtwangler on the stairs stops hearing the music
echoing
through the building
Furtwangler left hand begins to tremble but it is only
his way of sensing the tempo
Furtwangler slowly continues down the stairs
STEVES VOICE
We handed Wilhelm Furtwangler over
to the civil authorities and he
was charged with serving the Nazi
regime with uttering anti-Semitic
slurs performing at an official
Nazi Party function and with being
a Prussian Privy Councillor Dr
Furtwangler was acquitted I didnt
nail him But I sure winged him
And I know I did the right thing
Furtwangler resumed his career but
he was never allowed to conduct in
the United States He died in 1954
Little K succeeded him as head of
the Berlin Philharmonic
INT CONCERT HALL (ARCHIVE)
Furtwangler conducting Goebbels and other high-ranking
Nazis in the audience When the music finishes
Furtwangler
turns and bows Goebbels rises and shakes hands with
him
Furtwangler takes his handkerchief and wipes his hands
The film replays this gesture several times -
Furtwangler

wiping his hands
