INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

As MIKE pads quietly across the marble floors in the
quiet pausing to gaze in awe at the vast empty LIVING
ROOM It is gigantic his eyes roaming the ceilings as
though to estimate their height

Moving inward his eyes fall on a BOOK RACK and he
crosses to it perusing the shelves for possible reading
material

Theyre all ART BOOKS the big thick kind A Renoir
because of a NUDE FIGURE on the cover catches his eye
But as he pulls it out and begins to leaf through -- he
HEARS VOICES CLAIRES and NEILS her tone is agitated

NEIL (0S)
(barely audible)
just saying you should think
twice about it

CLAIRE (0S)
I dont want to talk about it

CLOSE ON MIKE book under his arm quietly moving toward
the SOURCE the DEN Its door is slightly ajar there
is a suitcase in front of it ready for travel

INT DEN - NIGHT

CLAIRE
You know and I know that the
only thing standing between a life

it

NEIL

She looks at him a beat emotionally He remains steady

NEIL
(gently)
Youre dealing with a psychopath
He gets out of jail in ten years or
five or ninety days and youll
be looking over your shoulder for
the rest of your life

CLAIRE
What am I supposed to do I saw
one of my oldest friends get killed
And I saw who did it
(through tears)
I cant just -- let it go away

NEIL
(gently)
Claire

ANGLE - DEN NEIL takes her in his arms holding her
tightly affectionately protectively Holding her from
behind NEIL KISSES CLAIRE gently on her neck She calms
in his arms

RETURN MIKE DODGES back quickly through the living and
dining rooms until hes in the kitchen

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Spotting the microwave MIKE QUICKLY TOSSES in an English
muffin -- peering at the dials as he switches it on

But he hasnt escaped being a trespasser to whats going
on in the far room He can still HEAR THEM though HE
WHISTLES trying not to

The English muffin BURSTS INTO FLAMES MIKE desperately
pulling it out tossing it into the sink feverishly
fanning the air

ANOTHER ANGLE ON MIKE becoming aware that HES NOT
ALONE He TURNS SUDDENLY to see MARY the housekeeper

245 AM (the clock ON THE WALL) pindrop silence MIKE
alone

CLOSE ON MIKE thoughtful leafing through the Renoir
Like a man making the most of solitary confinement --
becoming aware of a NOISE Though hard to make out in
this windowless capsule it is DISTANT THUNDER It stirs
life in him and his eyes wander reflexively upward
studying the ceiling -- then the doors of the apartment
left slightly ajar

ANGLE INSIDE THE APARTMENT CAMERA FOLLOWING MIKE as he
wanders inward becoming aware of light coming from a
drawing room HE MOVES TOWARD STOPPING

ANGLE FROM HIS POV CLAIRE dimly illuminated by the
light of a desk lamp that throws a gentle glow around her

silently and slipping through into the CLOSET and WALK-
THROUGH DRESSING ROOM leading to the bedroom by the far
side

INT CLAIRES BEDROOM - NIGHT

MIKE on the other side of the door listening

He opens the door quietly sees the anteroom door ajar
remembering that he had closed it before He tightens
closing the door and moving back to his gun in its holster
draped over the chair with his other clothes

INT DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

The KILLER enters the reflective maze

INT MASTER BATH - NIGHT

MIKE moves silently backtracking through the bedroom and
bathroom toward the DOORS leading to the dressing room
ahead

INT DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

The KILLER passes the door he wants thinking its just
another mirror finds himself in the totally MIRRORED
ENVIRONMENT of the MAIN DRESSING AREA

On the other side of the door MIKE HEARS HIM tightening
his grip on his gun and on the doorknob as he REACHES for
it MIKE grasps it turning and opening the door
silently But the latch connects to the light and the
LIGHT GOES ON OVERHEAD of MIKE

The KILLER reacts quickly gun drawn on the turn But he
faces SEVERAL REFLECTIONS OF MIKE in front of him -- and
MIKE IS BEHIND HIM

MIKE LEVELS AIM AT HIM

MIKE
Put it down
(beat)
Think about it

The KILLER takes his chances WHIRLING MIKE FIRES FIRST
NAILING HIM right through the HEAD The KILLER SPINS
AGAIN SLAMMING UP against the MIRRORS and falling DEAD to
the floor

IN THE BEDROOM CLAIRE wakes

MIKE checking quickly on the dead assassin flattens
himself against the wall and scurries back through the
bath the way back into the BEDROOM

MIKE
(entering to Claire)
Get on the floor There may be
more

MIKE RACES into the CORRIDOR hugging the wall he PAUSES

MIKE alone on a bench his head in his hands a couple of
COPS we recognize from the Precinct stand a distance away
at a coffee machine talking softly as they glance at him
It is not yet dawn

FOOTSTEPS are HEARD coming TOWARD MIKE looks up to see
GARBER APPROACHING his expression appropriate to the
occasion GARBER reaches him they exchange a long look
MIKES eyes etched with anguish

MIKE
(softly)
Theyre operating on him Hes
still alive

GARBER
(grim)
I heard

A long pause as he looks at MIKE

GARBER
I heard a lot Anything you want
to deny Mike

MIKE

(almost inaudibly)
It shouldve been me

GARBER aware of his own dilemma

GARBER
Then it wouldve been her too
(beat)
I dont know but I gotta protect

the Precinct too Youre on
suspension pending Disciplinary
Hearings Dont hold your breath
And youre not to go near that woman
until shes no longer under Police
protection and this case is closed

ANGLE ON MIKE responding with a silent nod as GARBER
stands looking down at him

GARBER
s it love Mike I hope so I
want it to be worth it for your
sake

No response

In the response that follows they HEAR MOVEMENT at the
end of the HALL looking up to see the silhouetted figures
of ELLIE with HELEN GREENING in tow They look small
and lost framed against a floor-to-ceiling window thats
beginning to illuminate with the first light of day

Heavy with sadness GARBER turns and heads toward the
women Taking a long moment MIKE decides not to follow

CLOSE ON MIKE

CAMERA STAYS AT THIS DISTANCE as the THREESOME comes
together We do not hear their words but sense the
emotion by what WE SEE After a brief exchange of words
GARBER takes HELEN GREENING under his arm and they MOVE
AWAY -- leaving MIKE and ELLIE alone
CLOSER ANGLE MIKE and ELLIE gazing at each other across
the gulf of their collective misery

ELLIE

MIKE

ELLIE
Hell live through it They all

(bitter)
What a world huh

Nothing left to say after a long last look she turns to
go But stops

ELLIE

CLAIRE
(heartfelt)

Ill miss you Mike

MIKE
Listen Ill see you again

Her eyes are glistening she gives him a bracing smile
But he cant quiet manage it

CLAIRE
(barely able to
speak)
Say goodbye

He struggles with it unable

MIKE
I like your coat

CLAIRE
(half-laugh half-cry)
You have a weakness for Lady Cops

MIKE
I do

Silence now their eyes adoring

CLAIRE
Say goodbye Mike

MIKE
(thick voiced)
You take care

MIKE TURNS -- CAMERA MOVING WITH HIM as he WALKS SLOWLY
AWAY -- finding himself on a collision course with GARBER
They meet spending a long moment in non-communicative
greeting

MIKE
(finally)
What do you think
(a beat)
Any chance Theres nothin else
Im any good at but this

GARBER
(noncommittal)
Call me next week Well talk about
it

MIKE absorbs it looking up to SEE ELLIE and TOMMY beside
a SQUAD CAR a distance away Girding himself he HEADS
TOWARD

ANGLE ON ELLIE AND TOMMY -- as he APPROACHES and stands
beside them Not much to say Finally he reaches out and
tousles TOMMYS hair

MIKE
Good police work kiddo

He catches ELLIES eye both assessing each other

ELLIE
(re Tommy)
He doesnt want to sleep here
(a long beat)
Neither do I Its not my house
anymore

MIKE
Me neither

ANGLE ON ALL finding each others eyes

MIKE
Lets find some place to start over

MIKE puts an arm AROUND TOMMY -- and the CAMERA BEGINS A
LONG PULLBACK as ELLIE moves to his side and the KEEGAN
FAMILY begins to MOVE AWAY WE SEE CLAIRE being helped
into a SQUAD CAR turning to look back at them as it PULLS
AWAY -- CARS REVVING UP and PULLING OUT in ALL
DIRECTIONS

From a distance we HEAR MIKES VOICE
MIKE (VO)
(to Ellie)
What this crap about singing
lessons

FADE OUT

THE END
