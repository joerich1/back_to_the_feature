STIR OF ECHOES

Written by

David Koepp

Based on the novel

Richard Matheson

March 26 1998

Sometimes within the brains old
ghostly house

I hear far off at some forgotten
door

A music and an eerie faint carouse
And stir of echoes down the
creaking floor

EXT STREET DAY

The Chicago skyline looms over the street they live on Not
the suburbs but not quite downtown either Racially mixed
Two story brick houses jammed side by side barely room for

raised voice across the narrow driveways Bar on the corner
neon sign -- BERNIES TAP A HOMELESS GUY rants his way
down the opposite sidewalk

Tom Maggie and PHILIP early twenties come out of the

and head down the steps Tom carries the baby monitor (the
receiver) in one hand Jakes breathing is clearly audible

the speaker

Toms on the sidewalk Maggie still three steps up stops
and puts her arms wide Tom turns around and Maggie lets
herself go falling straight forward Tom catches her on his
back and carries her piggy-back She leans around and bites
his ear

PHILIP
What are the odds of a single woman
being at this thing

TOM
“Bout a million to one

PHILIP
Any hot mommies

TOM

Depends How big you like ‘em

The hot engine of a Yellow Trans-Am fires up in the driveway
of the house across the street It backs into the street

passenger door hanging open The DRIVER honks the horn and a
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD KID runs out of another house and jumps
into the moving vehicle They take off The Homeless Guy
berates them shaking his fist
They reach the steps of the house next door PARTY NOISE
comes from within shadows move in the windows Tom swings
Maggie around puts her on the step wraps his arms around
her and kisses her Great kiss It goes on

Excuse me hello I enjoy soft-core as
much as the next guy but this is
almost like incest for me

She rolls on top of him and whispers

MAGGIE

LATER

the clock reads 231 am Maggie is asleep Tom is lying on
his back still awake

He looks over at the clock agitated He stares up at the
ceiling He closes his eyes

A BARRAGE OF IMAGES
races across the back of his eyelids
-- Philips face close to his a finger held in front of

him
-- A flame leaping out from a cigarette lighter
Six more faces pressed in close to his
Himself floating in an armchair above an empty movie
theatre
IN THE BEDROOM
Tom snaps his eyes open He rolls over onto his side
punching his pillow He closes his eyes again
MORE IMAGES COME
faster this time We share his point of view
-- A twelve year old boy beats us up in an alley near a
dumpster
-- A fourteen year old girl kisses us behind a brick
building

-- A vicious dog sinks its teeth into our calf
-- Maggie drowning reaches out to us
The images Increase in speed a half a dozen flip by so fast
falling

out

next

one

theyre almcst subliminal -- a car tire a broken arm

into water breaking window ham and eggs a bolt of
lightning

IN THE BEDROOM
Tom sits up abruptly shaking his head to clear it

TOM

the fuck man

He puts his hands to the side of his head It hurts A lot
Maggie stirs but doesnt wake up Tom gets up and walks

As he passes Jakes room he does a double take

IN JAKES ROOM
the four year old is awake Not just awake but standing

to his bed perfectly straight staring at the open doorway
Tom steps in He can see by the light of the nightlight

TOM

(WHISPERS)

Jake

The little boy doesnt answer Tom walks slowly over to the
boy and squats down in front of him putting his arms on the
boys shoulders

TOM (cont d)

Are you okay

Jake just looks at Tom straight into his fathers eyes The
boys face lights up in a wide smile He reaches out with

hand and rests his fingertips on Toms forehead

JAKE

Dont be afraid of it Daddy

The hell does that mean

But before Tom can respond Jake turns climbs back in bed
rolls over to face the wall and goes back to sleep

INT BATHROOM NIGHT
Tom shakes some Advil into his palm washes three down with
his

AN

seen

He

glass of water He runs water in the sink splashes some on
his face He straigltens looks in the mirror as he wipes

dripping face He stares at himself for a moment then
summons his nerve and closes his eyes

IMMEDIATELY
more images come
-- The front of Toms own house from a distance A MAN IN

OVERCOAT stands on the porch waving to us to come in
-- Rough hands attack us covering our eyes and face
-- A face close to ours but blurry and distorted as if

through dirty blue-tinted eyeglasses
-- Wooden floorboards as we race down toward them We hit
hard and our blood sprays out onto the wood

IN THE BATHROOM
Toms eyes pop open That was disturbing

INT LIVING ROOM NIGHT

Tom strides into the living room Their house is small
crowded with kids toys and furniture they got for their
wedding Tom paces back and forth holding his head in his
hands He turns and bolts into the kitchen

IN THE KITCHEN
Tom rips the refrigerator open and searches the top shelf

finds what hes looking for a large carton of orange juice
He opens a cabinet takes out a glass and fills it

He upends the glass drains it in one gulp Still
unsatisfied he picks up the carton He drinks the rest
Juice runs down his chin

BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM

Tom drops onto the sofa He sits for a moment trying to
regain himself His breathing returns to normal He sits
forward picks up the remote off the coffee table points it
at the TV and turns it on When he sits back --

-- theres a woman sitting next to him

vapor

her

Shes eighteen or nineteen years old so pale her skins
almost luminous Shes attractive but odd she wears a
billowy black dress with a diamond pattern bangles up and
down each wrist Her lips are light blue her eyes red-
rimmed Steam rises softly from her hair and skin when she
speaks her breath comes out of her mouth in clouds of

WOMA I

You can kiss me if you want to

Tom bolts to his feet and staggers away from the couch The
woman stares intently at him and says something else but

words are lost under the rising sound of static on the
television

TOM

What

She repeats but he can only see her lips moving the words
are lost under the static Realizing Tom turns hurriedly
toward the TV and hits the mute switch When he turns back -

-- the woman is gone He stands in the middle of the room
looking all around him But hes alone

INT BEDROOM NIGHT
Tom crawls back into bed and pulls the blankets up tight
around him Hes shivering

A HAND

drops over him and he nearly jumps out of his skin Its
Maggie rolling over to embrace him in her sleep He takes
her hand in his and lies still eyes wide open

the front of his own house

HE REMEMBERS

one of the images that blasted through his mind last night
Its his own house on a wintry day A man in an overcoat is
standing on the porch waving an arm in a friendly way --
Cmon in But the image is silent slow and eerie We move
slowly toward the porch toward the man in the overcoat

looking at so intently -- its Jake whos playing on the
sidewalk in front of their house while Maggie watches Tom
turns back but as he does the police car is just pulling

They come through the tunnel and into the stands Below the

out by the enthusiasm of the crowd

They make their way to the first open seats in the bleachers

a
bit loaded -- theres a lot of schnapps in that crowd and
beers snuck in here and there And thats the grown-ups

the crowd ROARS Tom tries to concentrate on the game but

hes totally distracted He looks to the right drawn by a

flash of light

A car is pulling into the parking lot at the end of the
field

BUZZING sound comes back louder the longer he stares
The crowd ROARS its approval of something Tom turns back
people

tries to follow the game He wipes sweat from his forehead
Maggie is staring at him She takes his hand and leans over
SHOUTING into his ear

MAGGIE

WHATS WRONG

As Tom turns to her his eye is drawn by something just over
her head

A GIANT LIGHT STANCHION towers over them When Tom sares
directly into the dozen large globes the BUZZING souni
overwhelms him nearly deafening His hands shoot up to his

first direction but when he looks the other way he hears a
faint BUZZING sound in the distance He doesnt hesitate
just takes off toward it

TWO BLOCKS AHEAD

Tom is running as hard as he can He stops abruptly The
buzzing sound is gone He looks to his right Behind a wall
there is a large parking lot filled with buses

He turns around A dull white glow comes from the windows of
the place on the corner He looks up at the sign

Its a Greyhound bus station

Tom hurries back toward it reaching the door just as Maggie
comes running up from the opposite direction

TOM
Wait right here keep your eyes open

bench with their back to him near the departure doors Tom
walks slowly across the place to the figure Its Dorothy
As he draws closer he sees Jakes face over Dorothys
shoulder Jakes eyes are open and hes staring up at the
ceiling

Tom follows his sons gaze Jake is staring up at the

the old-style fluorescent tubes that give the place its
cancerous look The tubes BUZZ loudly Its the sound Toms
been hearing

Jake sees his father and smiles Tom puts a finger to his
lips -- Shhhh Jake yawns closes his eyes and drops his
head onto Dorothys shoulder He goes back to sleep

Tom walks slowly around the end of the bench Dorothy is
SINGING softly an old nursery rhyme

She looks up suddenly and sees Tom She starts to jerk to

feet Tom puts a hand out -- take it easy Dorothy sits
back caught Tom steps closer to her carefully He holds
both his hands out palms up

TOM

Give him to me

She shakes her head no Outside a SIREN WHINES and a police
car flashes past the window its red lights spinning They
both hear it and glance over then look back at each other
Tom raises an eyebrow She knows what he means

TOM (contd)

Give him to me Dorothy

Trembling Dorothy reaches out Jake in her arms Tom gently
takes the boy from her and holds him tight

The front door flies open and Maggie races inside Tom gives
Jake over to her

JAKE

Tom lies down on the tongue The Nurses wrap sheets around
his arms and tuck them in under his body immobilizing them
He looks at one of them questioningly

NURSE
So your arms dont touch the sides of
the machine

TOM

That would be bad

She smiles and nods The other Nurse puts a white cloth over
his hair

NURSE 2

Your party hat

He tries to smile but he is unnerved Elizabeth leans in
staring down at Tom

ELIZABETH

stop Its incredibly claustrophobic

Toms eyes widen The hammers whip faster Their POUNDING is

EXT NAVY PIER NIGHT

Navy Pier is an amusement parkshopping mall built on a pier
jutting out into Lake Michigan Its a nice night the pier
is crowded just enough urban edge to be interesting A
figure bobs along above the crowd -- Jake sitting on Toms
shoulders They stop and join a CROWD watching a JUGGLER a
good one keeps five burning pins in the air

Jake suddenly looks up confused by something He stares

the juggler through the flames Behind the juggler a
UNIFORMED COP is staring at the little boy -- its the same
Cop who was parked outside their house earlier Jake stares
back the flaming pins flying up between them

Tom moves on his boy still on his shoulders The Cop turns
and watches them go Jake turns looking back over his
shoulder at the Cop The Cop raises a hand and waves Jake
just stares

AT A TOY STORE
there is an elaborate model train set on display in the
window

TOM

Woah check it out

He stops helps Jake down off his shoulders Jake presses
right up against the glass staring at the train as it

the track Tom squats admiring it with him

BEHIND THEM

the Cop is still watching them He walks closer stops only
about ten feet away staring Tom glances up sees him
thinks nothing of it

The op steps closer

IN THE WINDOW

Tom sees the reflection of the Cop Closer now staring Tom
turns and smiles tight-lipped He recognizes him from the
other day The Cop smiles back doesnt go away

TOM

(to Jake)

Hey look at that one

He carries Jake to the next window over a different

The Cop wanders closer Tom finally turns to him tense

window now

COP
Huh Oh no course not Im

He sweeps Jake up onto one hip and starts to walk away

COP

TOM (cont d)

I dont know what youre talking

COP

Jont be afraid of it

Tom just star s at the Cop trembling slightly The Cop
walks

forward Fascinated Tom does not back away The Cop lowers

his voice

COP (cont d)

Youre not alone

Tom is too rattled to speak

COP (cont d)

You dont know about Cacophony yet

Tom shakes his head no The Cop pulls out a note pad

scribbles something on a page tears it out and holds it out

to Tom

His hand shaking Tom accepts the paper The Cop reaches out

and tousles Jakes hair

soft tune to himself the same one he hummed during his bath
in the opening

Tom and Maggie sit near him staring at him Theyre freaked
out What have they got on their hands here Their tone is
soft gently probing

She looks up at him For a long moment they just stare at
each other Steam rises lightly from her as she breathes
Tom is shaking barely finds his voice

She speaks but when her voice comes out its horrible and
distorted -- muffled in a strange way

He takes a few trembling steps down the stairs closer to

She walks forward a step or two She speaks again louder
but the voice is still unintelligible and bizarre
Tom reaches the bottom of the stairs She reaches out a

He stares terrified The hand draws closer

Almost beyond his own control Tom raises his own hand

She comes closer

Tom is frozen at the bottom of the stairs Their hands draw
closer still

Their fingertips touch

Tom GASPS as if something very heavy were put down on his
chest His mouth drops open his chest twitches He cant
breathe

They stand there frozen in that position Tom tries but
cant draw air

MAGGIES VOICE calls out from the top ci the stairs

MAGGIE

Tom

He cant answer Hes panicked but unable to move With
every twitch of his chest clouds of steam burst from his
mouth all the air going out none coming in

From the top of the stairs Maggie can see him standing
there hand outstretched into the darkness touching

In the dining room she flops over onto the floor like a
reflection appearing suddenly on the surface of a pond Into

people on the far couch one a THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL the

Tom picks up a ham chunk and looks at the steaming fondue

full of cheese Beverly dips and eats winks at him and
flits off across the room

No Herman youre a freak Mutants

is a better word for the rest of us

He pulls ip a chair and sits down opposite Tom On the

side of tie room Vivian and Beverly tell an animated two-

story to he teenage girl and the homey finishing each
others se tences

NEIL (cont d)

Like any other part of our body our
brains have evolved a lot in a hundred
thousand years Our first thoughts
were formless Struggling
consciousness Sensation An
instinctive tie to our environment
But then our brains began to focus

We sacrificed the intuitions we first
had so our thoughts could be directed
so we could master specific functions
Thats where we are at the moment
Were brilliant with technique but
weve given up instinct So the next
evolutionary step the step yet to
come or perhaps its already in the
making is actually backward To
maintain our higher functions but

reawaken the part of our brain that
was pure intuition That was
receptive to anything because it
didnt know enough not to believe
Youre a freak of nature pal an
evolutionary step Youre double-
jointed

(taps his head)

Up here

TOM
Are we the only ones

NEIL

Hardly Ive heard of groups like
ours in San Francisco New York
Minneapolis -- those are just the
cities Ive been to Tom youre what
they used to call a medium Youre
like a man in a dark tunnel with a
flashlight but the light only goes on
once in a while When it flickers on
you get a glimpse of something but
not enough of a glimpse to know what
it is Just enough to know its
there

TOM
What about my son

NEIL

(sn files)

The ncxt generation Much better
flashlight

TOM
Wright if theres all these people
who got this power why doesnt
everybody know about it Why isnt it
common knowledge

NEIL

It is A lotta people know
Unfortunately the easiest people to
convince the believer types they
also tend to be the dumbest And
people who demand proof -- well this
isnt something we can control it
comes when it comes so if you cant
make it happen how can you prove it
Its like that singing frog in the
cartoon but when the guy puts it on
stage it just croaks and he looks like
a jerk
Herman laughs horribly He likes that cartoon
NEIL (cont d)

Some of us try anyway I say who

needs that kind of aggravation

TOM
This all started when I was
hypnotized Is that how it always is

NEIL

First time Ive heard that one it
comes all different ways Sometimes
it goes the same way it came

TOM
So it does go away

NEIL
For some people Dont look for

rules Were off the map here

HERMAN
What does it want you to do

TOM
What does what want me to do

HERMAN
You saw a ghos- didnt you

Yeah Twice t girl that disappeared
from my neighborhood Now the kid
next door just tried to kill himself
I think he knew something but now
Ill never know what it was And I
gotta know

HERMAN
Look whatd the bitch want

TOM
Why do you assume she wants something

NEIL

They always do Something they need
finished something they cant do any
more

TOM
Why me

NEIL

Because shes confused Doesnt know
why other people wont answer her
She only knows that you will If she
hasnt asked for something yet she
will And once they ask its very
difficult to stop yourself from doing
it

TOM

What do you mean She can it can
make me do something I dont want to
do

NEIL

Oh no Youll want to Badly You
wont think about anything else You
wont sleep You wont eat Youll
lie And God help anyone who tries to
stop you

TOM
What if I stop me What if I just
dont do it

drift toward it in your chair

Up ahead of us the screen is a dazzling white We move
slowly toward it floating over the seats

PHILIP (os)

There are letters up on the screen

Tall thick black letters but

theyre out of focus You drift

closer to them

We do drift closer to the blurry letters but our attention

diverted by something Three rows from the screen there is
figure in one of the seats its back to us

turns

Its Samantha Her face is shrouded in plastic Her mouth
presses against the plastic it forms a horrible round 0

the movie theatre sitting right next to Samantha Shes
pawing at him its all he can do to fight her hands off In
their struggle his fingers close around the plastic that
shrouds her face He sweeps it off her head

PHILIP (os)

The screen Tom look at the screen

You can read the letters now

Samanthas face is bloodied and bruised as the plastic

off she GASPS for air and lets out a ghastly inhuman SHRIEK
that fills the theatre Philips voice gets louder as he
struggles to maintain control of the hypnosis

PHILIP (os)

Look at the screen Tom youre close

enough now you can read the letters

youre right up next to them

Tom still holding off Samanthas grasping hands turns and
looks up at the movie screen

PHILIP (o s )

Toms eyes widen as he stares at the screen Three huge
letters pop into focus and fill our field of vision The
letters say

EXT DRIVEWAY DAY

Jake twisted around in his car seat looks out the back
window of Maggies car He raises one hand waving

Tom stands in the open doorway of the garage still in his

stained jeans and tee shirt He waves back
The car pulls out of the driveway fast and ROARS off down
the block Jake and Maggie are gone

EXT BACK YARD DAY
There are now five large holes in the back yard and Tom is
running out of places to dig Nevertheless he drags the

across the yard to an untouched patch of grass in the far
corner
He stops short Hose wont reach

AT THE SPIGOT
he unscrews the hose and carries it across the yard

AT ANOTHER SPIGOT
this one in the far corner he reconnects the hose and turns
on the water Nothing comes out

TOM

Come on

Tom curses and trudges back toward the house

INT KITCHEN DAY
Tom gets a screwdriver from a tool drawer in the kit-hen

INT DINING ROOM DAY
crack

the

from

mess

the

spigot

Tom stomps into the dining room and goes to a closet on the
far wall He opens the door and tosses aside a carpet flap
that covers the floor He shoves the screwdriver into a

in the floor and pries up a trap door two feet square in

middle of the closet floor

Through the hole he can see a ladder resting up against the
wall below He feels for the rungs with his feet and starts
to climb down

INT BASEMENT DAY
As Tom climbs down he reaches out for a chain that hangs

a bare bulb in the ceiling and turns it on They have only a
partial basement a ten by ten foot space about eight feet
deep The rest of the area under the house is just crawl
space barely enough to wriggle through

Tom reaches the bottom and goes to the far side where a

of water pipes all converge He picks through them finds

valves that lead outside turns one off and another one on
WATER surges through the pipes headed out to the far

He turns to climb back up the ladder

And stops

He looks down at the floor Its dirt

He kicks at the dirt with his shoe thinking

A FEW MINUTES LATER

the pick axe falls Tom has brought all his tools into the
basement and is now digging in the middle of the basement
floor The bare bulb throws his exaggerated shadow on the
earthen walls

He works

EXT OUR BLOCK DAY
Its quiet in the neighborhood The CRUNCHING sound of Toms
pick axe falling echoes over the block

INT BASEMENT DAY
Tom digs The hole is almost four feet across five feet
deep Hes uncovered a large rock a major chunk of stone
mud

shovels

RENTAL

the

right in the middle of where he wants to dig Hes excavated
all around the edges of the thing and is trying to wedge it
loose with a pry bar but it wont budge

Tom collapses onto the floor leaning against the pile of

and stone hes already hauled out He thinks
CUT TO

INT YARD SUPPLY WAREHOUSE DAY
Tom walks down an aisle along one wall in a huge yard supply
warehouse Tools are mounted on the wall for sale --

picks post hole diggers Got all that Tom keeps walking
The tools get bigger Huge shovels Tractor blades Hand
pile drivers Almost but not quite Tom keeps walking

At the end of the row underneath a sign that says FOR

ONLY is an industrial-size jackhammer the kind road crews
use to bust through whatevers in their way
Toms face lights up

EXT STREET DAY

The jackhammer rides in the back of Toms pickup truck
rattling along as the truck bounces over potholes Tom pulls
into his driveway comes around and drops the gate

Using all his strength he wrestles the jackhammer out of

back of the truck Its incredibly heavy it takes all his
strength to haul it up the stairs kick open his door and
bring it into the house

IN THE STREET
Lenny the neighborhood crank is washing his car He hears

CRASH from over at Toms place and turns He sees Tom at his
pickup lugging a huge air compressor out of it

Tom fights his way into the house with the compressor

Lenny stares at him

stops

Sheila carrying flowers and looking like didnt sleep last
night comes out of her house and heads for her car She
stops and stares too

INT BASEMENT DAY
In Toms basement the compressor descends through the trap
door above seemingly of its own accord -- than we see its

the end of a rope and Tom is up in the trap door space
sweating and straining lowering the thing down
It settles on the floor next to the jackhammer

A BIT LATER
Tom reaches up to the hanging light bulb which also has an
electrical outlet in its fixture and plugs in a yellow

cord
He flicks a switch on the compressor and it RATTLES to life
He follows a hose over to where it plugs into the side of

jackhammer which now quivers with unleashed power

Tom picks up the jackhammer He hauls it over to the rock
thats been in his way He positions the jackhammers spike
on the top of the rock He lowers a pair of goggles over his
eyes He swings his weight up onto the jackhammer and
squeezes the handles
The jackhammer ROARS to life Its deafening Toms whole
body quivers Its like riding a bull but the rock begins

split in half
Tom WHOOPS with joy barely heard over the din that echoes

his basement

EXT STREET DUSK
As the sun goes down the sound of the ROARING jackhammer is
plainly audible on the block The familiar Homeless Guy

and SHOUTS something at Toms house
Across the street Kurt Damon comes out his front door and
stares at Toms house What the hell is that guy up to

She walks faster

Then she runs

CUT TO

INT BASEMENT NIGHT

In the basement Tom abruptly stops digging staring at the
dirt The corner of something shiny is sticking out from the

pile He bends down and pulls it out

Its a piece of clear blue plastic sheeting about two

square Toms hand starts to shake as he holds it
it

middle

flinches

AN IMAGE

flases through his mind again the one hes seen twice
befoi- A FACE too close to his sting at him through that
blurr blue like through bad eyeglasses

IN THE BASEMENT

Tom turns and leaps into the hole shovel in hand He begins
to dig wildly flinging dirt in all directions At one end
of the hole his shovel slips the dirt spilling off it as

sticks on something Something buried

Tom drops the shovel He falls to his knees and uses his
hands to rake the dirt away from whatever it was

More blue plastic

Tom tugs out about eight inches of the plastic gets a good
grip on it with both hands He pulls it up

Like a rope pulled out of the sand the edge of the blue
plastic rises up unearthing itself in a line down the

of the pit
Breathing hard Tom grabs the shovel again

THE DIRT
flies away from the plastic as Tom works furiously

TOMS FACE
is of a man possessed He digs as fast as he can

FINALLY
Tom stands back staring down at what he has unearthed
Above him we see what it is A long piece of blue plastic
wrapped around something about five and a half feet long and
two and a half feet wide

Tom bends down and lays one hand on the plastic He

AN IMAGE

pops into his mind another familiar one A FIGURE IN Afl
OVERCOAT standing on the front porch of Toms own house in
winter waving to us to come up

making

and

hand

blue

he

covered

IN THE BASEMENT

Tom jerks his hand off the plastic He swallows

He goes to hi toolbox and pulls out a utility knife He
slides the ra or blade forward

He goes to one and of the plastic bends down and jams the
nife through the sheeting He walks the length of it

a slit down the middle He reaches out with shaking hands

pulls part of the plastic back
The first thing he sees is a partially decomposed human

Around the withered wrist there are a half dozen multi-
colored bracelets

Tom yanks the rest of the plastic away revealing the half-
decomposed body of Samantha Muller still in the black dress
with the diamond pattern Tom stands there his chest
heaving

He looks at her hand thinking

He sits down next to her

He reaches out for her hand then pulls his own back

Cant do it

But hes gotta He opens his hand reaching out for hers He
slides his hand underneath --

takes a deep breath --

-- and closes his living fingers around her skeletal ones
He GASPS

His face turns a horrible shade of pale his lips go ice

and STEAM comes out of his mouth the way it did hers when
first saw her in his living room

EXT TOMS HOUSE DAY

Its a wintry day That same steam rises up in front of us
coming from our own mouth Were looking at the front porch
of Toms house as we walk past it The house is being
remodeled its surrounded by scaffolding its windows

shoulders and starts to push us down

KURT

Come on baby how “bout a little

helmet wash

His belt buckle comes into our view and his hands on it We
tear away get up and run for the door

From behind something hits us very hard The floorboards
race up at us all of a sudden We land on them hard

off our own blood spraying out on the unfinished wood
Our head lands sideways on the floor We see Adam McCarthy
vomiting in the corner

Abruptly were rolled over and are staring at the ceiling
Kurt Damon is on top of us his face too close Her hands
rise up try to push him off but hes stronger
tearing

Samantha starts to SCREAM Hands close over our face She
bites and the hands are pulled away She SCREAMS again
KURT (cont d)

SHUT UP SHUT UP

Kurt holds her down begins to try to undress her She
writhes and SCREAMS She gets one hand into Kurts hair and
pulls as hard as she can He SHOUTS in pain

In the corner Adam McCarthy has his hands over his ears

ADAM
MAKE HER STOP MAKE HER STOP

SCREAMIN MAN MAKE HER STOP

But she keeps screaming Adam staggers to a boom box thats
sitting on the fireplace mantle and flicks a switch A SONG
comes on loud Its a haunting tune we recognize it

Sts the song Jake has been humming

Kurt continues his fumbling drunken attempts at rape

her hand out of his hair

KURT
SHUT HER UP USE YOUR JACKET OR

SOMETHING

Adam lunges to the wall and tears down a sheet of the blts

plastic Duvateen He races over to us with the sheet --

Samanthas He opens his eyes and gulps air The color
returns to his face as he pulls his hand away from hers
But as he does so he stops staring intently at something

her fingers We dont see what it is
Tom draws himself to his feet and climbs the ladder that

upstairs

As he goes we pause looking between two rungs near the top

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR DAY
A NEWBORN BABY stares up at us from inside a rolling

The bassinet is wheeled swiftly down a hospital corridor by

NURSE Its a long trip wherever its going but the baby
waits patiently staring up at the ceiling eyes open
Above the baby the lights streak by white blurs

The Nurse leans down and looks at the baby To the baby
shes just a fuzzy blob

NURSE
Almost there

The baby turns and looks sideways The doors of the hospital
rooms whiz by brown smears

NURSE (cont d)

Just around this corner

She rolls the bassinet around a corner and toward one or in
particular

The baby sees a bunch of shapes inside the room

INT HOSPITAL ROOM DAY

Maggie who has recently given birth struggles to sit up in

her eagerly

The baby sees Toms blurry face Jake steps up onto a step
stool so he can see over the edge of the bed

JAKE

Let me see let me see

Maggie turns the baby so shes facing Jake The infant looks
at her older brother At first his face is as blurry as
everybody elses But slowly Jakes face becomes crystal
clear even though everything around him stays out of focus
JAKE (cont d)

Can I hold her
down

MAGGIE
If youre very very careful Climb
up here

Jake climbs up on the bed Maggie puts some pillows around
him and carefully places the baby in his lap Jake looks

at the infant His expression becomes very serious Gently
he reaches out with one hand and puts his fingertips on the
babys forehead the same way he did to Toms forehead that
first night

The baby and Jake stare at each other for a long moment So
long in fact that the adults become uncomfortable

NURSE

Well they certainly get along

Suddenly Jake breaks into a wide grin and looks up at his
parents thrilled Then he looks back at his sister He
leans down and whispers softly in her ear

JAKE
