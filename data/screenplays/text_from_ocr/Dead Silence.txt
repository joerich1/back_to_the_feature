FADE IN
INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

AB candlé “Its flame pulses throwing a halo of light onto a
bone white wall

In the jaundice glow the silhouette of a woman sits on the
edge of a bed Lying in the bed is another “igure also
veiled in shadow

The woman tucks the figure in Their faces remain hidden in
darkness as the scene plays out

‘ WOMAN
Time to go to sleep

BOY
Tell me another story

WOMAN
It’s getting late Tomorrow night

BOY
Go on I promise I‘1l be good for
the rest of the year if you do

The woman laughs

WOMAN
What kind of story

BOY
A scary one

WOMAN
I dont know if I should You’li
have nightmares and wake up
screaming

BoY
I won‘t I swear it I swear it

The woman sighs

WOMAN
Well I hope you‘re right about not -
screaming
(beat)
Thats the last thing youd ever
want to do
BOY
why

The woman leans forward and whispers

WOMAN
Because Mary Shaw might hear you

BOY
Whos Mary Shaw

WOMAN
What You mean you don‘t know the
tale of Mary Shaw

BOY
No Tell me

We MOVE AWAY from the bed searching through the inky
darkness A spotlight illuminates a young girl of about five
She sits at a children’s size table pouring tea for a doll

WOMAN (V0O)
Once in the town of Ravens Fair
a little girl named Mary
sat alone in despair
No one loved this little girl
neither hugged her nor kissed her
so she talked to her dolls
like they were brothers and
sisters

We move past the little girl searching through the dark and
finding Mary at age 17 She is pregnant

WOMAN (VO)
When Mary left home
she went straight out and married
and soon in her belly
a child she carried

A MOUSTACHED man who is clearly drunk steps up behind Mary
SLAPPING her viciously and ATTACKING HER

WOMAN (V0)
That is ‘til the night
her husband attacked her
she lost the baby
and sadness did wrack her

Everything goes dark then another spotlight swords through
the space giving light to a haggard and desperate looking
Mary nursing one of her childhood dolls She whispers to it

WOMAN (V0)
Some say she went mad
a little round the bend
because she started talking
to her dolls again
A red velvet curtain behind Mary parts revealing MARY now
an OLD WOMAN sitting on a stage with a classic
VENTRILOQUISTS DUMMY on her lap

WOMAN (V0)

To Mary it wasnt a toy

made of nuts bolts and wood

to her she held a living being
the child she never could

Over the years she made a living
talking to those dolls

a ventriloquist she became

the most talented of all

As an unseen audience roars with applause the red velvet
curtain closes and we ascend into the blackness - finding
the weary figure of Mary trudging up a set of stairs

WOMAN (V0)
Then late one night
when she returned to her room
hidden high above the stage
dark and cramped like a tomb

Mary steps into her living quarters BEHIND HER a man KICKS
open the door It is the husband who attacked her earlier

WOMAN (V0)
--her husband the brute
As usual horribly drunk
heard Mary talk back to him
and demanded her tongue

The man hurls Mary onto a table pinning her down and holding
a razor aloft

WOMAN (VO)
Mary resisted
wouldn’t open her mouth
s0 he made her scream
and then cut it out

Mary SCREAMS - and the man severs her tongue with the razor
Darkness descends on Mary as she CRIES and cowers ina

corner next to an empty babies crib Her back is to us her
face buried in her hands

She turns and steps up onto a stool slipping her head nzo
noose

WOMAN (V0)
Mary couldn’t go on
without her tongue

She put her head in a noose
and from it she swung

Mary steps off the stool swinging in the noose Her
ventriloguist dummy is slumped in a chair opposite her

WOMAN (V0)
But after that night
it was said
that Mary Shaw
wasn’t really dead
Something had gone
from her into the doll
her spirit found a way
to exact a terrible toll

We move away another spotlight showing us Mary’s husband
lying in bed A noise stirs him awake and he sits up

WOMAN (V0)

Her ghost would leave

the doll at night

and appear to people

to cause them fright

And if those people

who saw her did scream

their tongues would be gone -
ripped out clean

A shadow falls over Mary’s husband and he SCREAMS

A cluster of gas lanterns swarm into view the figures
holding them are all clutching Mary’s ventriloquist dummy
They wrap the doll in rosary beads stuffing it into a heavy
trunk

WOMAN (V0)
Eventually the town of Ravens
Fair
couldn‘t take it anymore
not one more scare

They locked away

the cursed puppet
stowed it in a trunk
bolted and shut it

The trunk is slammed shut and BOLTED with a padlock

We explore the darkness beyond the trunk finding ourselves
once again in the dark candle-lit bedroom we opened in

The woman leans forward lowering her voice for che finale of
this Grimm poem

WOMAN

But should you ever see her
and your knees go weak

and you forget

to hold in your shriek
remember these words

that I have sung -

it won’t be the cat

that’s got your tongue

The woman lets the words ring in the boys ears
BOY
So what do I do if Mary Shaw comes

to visit me

The woman laughs She’s enjoying this

WOMAN
There’‘s only one thing that can
stop her

BOY

What’s that mother

She picks up the candle next to the bed holding it under her
face

WOMAN
Silence

DISSOLVE TO
INT VARIOUS ROOMS APARTMENT - NIGHT
Home sweet home
Thats what the sign hanging on the wall says
We explore the room further finding framed photos of a happy
young couple tastefully placed flower arrangements and a
pretty good eleventh floor view of the city - all crammed

into a shoebox apartment

Ah yes modern domestic bliss

MALE VOICE a Ouch

The voice came from the
KITCHEN

where a young man is wedged under the sink wrenching at
pipes This is JAMIE ASHEN We cannot see his face vez

An earthy beautiful young woman enters LISA LISA

Don‘t hurt yourself there big guy
- JAMIE

I’m fine it’sstuck that’s all
LISA

Maybe we should just call someone
Jamie

Jamie emerges from under the sink His young looks match his

Batman T-shirt - this is one man who isnt done being a boy

JAMIE
Like who A real man

Lisa grins

LISA “
I didn’t say that -
JAMIE
Why don’t you just castrate me and

give me a membership to Oprah‘s
book club while you’re at it

LISA
Yeah that would be fun Then we
could call up a real man and let
him fix the sink while we read

Jamie breaks into a run Lisa SCREAMS and he chases her into
the

LIVING ROOM

Jamie catches her pinning her down on the couch as she
giggles hysterically

LISA
Don‘t Please
Jamie sits on top of her

JAMIE
Do you want me to prove to you what
“ a real man I am right now

LISA
Yeah - fix the sink that oughta do
it

She bursts out laughing He tightens his grip on her arms

JAMIE
I‘m going to if you stop
interrupting me

LISA
Okay I will
(beat)
The only thing is Im probably
going to need to use it sometime
this year so

She laughs again He lowers his face hovering inches above
hers They pause staring into each others eyes

LISA
Never mind There are other ways you
can prove your manhood to me

JAMIE
Oh really

LISA
Yeah

They kiss passionately Jamie releases her arms and they curl
around him They roll over limbs entwined This is so on

KNOCK KNOCK
Jamie stops kissing her reluctantly

JAMIE
Timing

Be gets up and goes to the door
JAMIE

If this is a plumber you’re in
trouble
He opens the door A delivery man is standing there holding
a large box

DELIVERY MAN
Lisa Tuck

JAMIE
She’s inside Ill sign for it

He signs and takes the package closing the door

LISA
What is it
JAMIE
It’s a big god damned box is what

it is
Lisa takes it and places it on the living room table She
checks the label on the package It is addressed to her
There is no sender address

Jamie appears handing her a pair of scissors

JAMIE
Come on open it up

Lisa cuts through the tape opening the box

She claws through a layer of shredded newspaper revealing a
cracked and peeling wooden eurface beneath

Curious she reaches inside and lifts out --
-- a VENTRILOQUIST’S DUMMY

The dummy is wearing a tattered tuxedo - a red handkerchief
hanging out of the top pocket

It is the doll we saw MARY SHAW performing with in the
opening scenes

JAMIE
What the hell is that

LISA
I have no idea

She scratches around through the shredded newspaper finding
nothing else inside the box

JAMIE
That’s the creepiest thing I’ve
ever seen in my life

2 “LISA
Who would send it to me

JAMIE
Somebody creepy

LISA
It’s some kind of doll

JAMIE
No A doll is something a child
plays with That is something a man
in a raincoat who hears voices in
his head plays with

LISA
I want to know where it came from

JAMIE
Can you find out

aan LISA
I don’t know

— They sit the dummy on the table It stares at them with
lifeless black pupils

LISA

Maybe it’s a gift from your dad
JAMIE

Hes definitely creepy enough
LISA

He called again today
JAMIE

Are you serious
LISA

He’s been trying to reach you for

weeks
JAMIE

Yeah wellhe can keep trying

A long beat They return the dummies gaze

Lisa finally turns to face Jamie

‘oO
LISA
Are you going to stare at this
thing all night or go back to being
a handyman so we can make dinner
Jamie looks down at the wrench in his hand
cur TO
INT CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Jamie hands over cash in exchange for a bag of greasy Chinese
takeout

EXT CITY STREET OUTSIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Rain cascades down in sheets

Jamie steps out into the downpour shielding himself with a
newspaper

The concrete arches of the city loom overhead trapping a
cacophony of NOISE Car horns blare sirens shriek people
shout to be heard above it all

Jamie makes a break for his car A fire-truck roars past
throwing water up onto him He opens the driver’s door
setting offthe alarm

INT JAMIES CAR PARKED - CONTINUOUS

He jumps inside shutting off the alarm and closing the door
lowering the volume of the city outside Thank God

He takes a deep breath Looks up and sees a woman selling
roses in a doorway

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
Mid-scale New York style
INT CORRIDOR APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Jamie skips up the stairs seems giddy In one hand - the
takeout in the other - a long stemmed rose

He reaches his door fishes for his keys
INT VARIOUS ROOMS APARTMENT - SAME

Jamie moves through the darkened apartment to the kitchen
Dumps the takeout on the counter

-ae

He takes plates out of a drawer

JAMIE
You’re gonna love this You’re
-gonna be’ glad we didnt make dinner
“ourselves

He listens A beat of silence passes
JAMTE
You’re not talking to me anymore
is that it

He arranges the rice on the plates like he made it himself

JAMIE
Hello

Lisas voice answers from upstairs Sounds strangely
detached

LISA (0S)
No I’m never talking to you again

Jamie grins
JAMIE
What if I was planning on coming
upstairs and making you beg for
mercy

LISA (0S)
You’d be too late

Jamie takes the plates walks out of the kitchen

JAMIE
Well I guess I -- JESUS

HE STOPS DEAD

Beneath him on the living room carpet is a splotch of
BLOODin the shape of a foot

He stares at it then steps forward slowly seeing a
crimson trail of footprints weave through the entire
apartment

Fresh Wet Red
Instinctively he puts down the plates and snatches up a

kitchen knife Begins to stalk through the house in their
wake
ho

LISA (0S)
Whats wrong

Jamie listens The apartment is eerily silent

LISA (0S)
Jamie

He continues following the trail the footprints becoming
messy ponds of blood Trembling he reaches a door the blood
disappearing under it

He grips the handle

LISA (0S)
Jamie

His chest expands as he heaves in a deep breath

He flings the door open -- revealing a darkened laundry In
the shadows he can clearly make out the SILHOUETTE of a
figure slumped on the floor

LISA (0S)
What’s going on

That time Lisa‘s voice is RIGHT BEHIND HIM He whips around
to warn hers

JAMIE
Lisa stay back

But Lisa is not there He turns to face the intruder

JAMIE
Who are you

No answer Trembling with fear Jamie flicks on the light
illuminating the figure

IT IS LISA

DEAD

Blood seeps from within her mouth where her tongue should
bebut ISN’T Her face is a death mask molded midscream

Contorted horrified - a frozen image of terror

Jamie cannot comprehend what he is seeing confusion and
shock colliding together on his face

From somewhere in the abyss he lets out a primal tortured
SCREAM

JAMIE

The scream changes pitch becoming --
EXT JAMIES APARTMENT BUILDING — NIGHT
-- a siren

Uniformed police swarm around the entrance to Jamies
building clearing a path for a gurney which is loaded into a
coroner’s van

We know the two cops talking to Jamie are important because
they’re not in uniform Trench-coats and stern looks

Jamie however is a million miles away
INT INTERVIEW ROOM POLICE STATION - DAY

Jamie is slumped at a table He is a SHATTERED man Numb from
theshock Zombie-like

Detective JIM LIPTON sits opposite a picture of hard-
edged skepticism A lit fuse

LIPTON
Was the victim taking any
prescription drugs of any kind that
you know of For depression or any
form of mental illness

JAMIE
No

LIPTON
Does anyone in her family suffer
from any form of mental illness or
depression that you know of

JAMIE
Why are you asking me this What
does it have to do with anything

Lipton drills him with a hard stare Decides to let it goa
LIPTON
Did you notice anything different
that night In her behavior
Anything at all unusual

Jamie stares at the floor thinking back

JAMIE
The doll

LIPTON
Whats that

JAMIE
Lisa received some sort
ofdollin the mail that night
She didn’t know who had sent it to
her

LIPTON
Okay What about after you arrived

evidence of a struggle weapons

Jamie is clearly mystified by the nights events Finally

JAMIE
I spoke to her

LIPTON
What do you mean

JAMIE
I spoke to her when I first got
home

(beat)
I called out to her and she
answered me

Lipton scans a file in front of him
LIPTON
You said that you were gone about
forty minutes and that you got
back home right at seven PM
Jamie nods
LIPTON (CONTD)
Our forensic records show that the
victim had been dead at least
twenty minutes before that
Jamie looks up at Lipton terror on his face

JAMIE
That can’t be

He meets Lipton‘’s suspicious gaze Their eyes stay locked

INT LIVING ROOM APARTMENT - DAY
Raining
The apartment is bare almost empty

Jamie is collapsed on the floor by the window his gaze
reflected in’the rain-soaked glass Tears streak down his
face

The phone rings Jamie doesn’t react Let’s the call go to
the answering machine

JAMIE AND LISA (V0)

(in attempted unison)
Hello

This might sound like us but you’re

machine right now Leave a message

A beep

MAN’S VOICE (V0)
Hello Jamie

Jamie turns towards the answering machine The voice is
gravelly and slurred as if it were an effort to talk

MAN’S VOICE (V0)
I only want to say two things-
Please allow me to do so

Jamie stares at the machine

MANS VOICE (V0)
The first is that you have my
deepest sympathies in regards to

Jamie turns away

MANS VOICE (V0)
Goodbye son

CLICK
Jamie reaches over and pushes the ERASE button

As he does he glances over and sees the package the
VENTRILOQUIST’S DUMMY came in sitting under the dining table

He crawls over to it hauls it out and opens it up He lifts
out the dummy stares at its smiling face

The dummies jaw falls open - a red cloth tongue falling out
of it Disturbed Jamie checks the box He leafs through the
thin strips of paper that cushioned the doll

Holds one up to the light seeing a faded typeface on it
It‘s a shred of newspaper

The letters on it read “ns Fair”

JAMIE
Ravens Fair
EXT COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

A lonely road snakes through the fall-kissed countryside
beneath a grey sky Jamie’s car appears over a hill

EXT RAVENS FAIR - DAY

Jamie’s car speeds past a weathered wooden sign - WELCOME TC
RAVENS FAIR - A QUIET LITTLE TOWN

The town of Ravens Fair yawns out in the valley beyond the

sign old buildings jutting out of the landscape like rotting
teeth

The perfect place for a funeral
EXT WALKER FUNERAL HOME - DUSK

The sun sets over the modest headquarters of the towns
deceased

Jamie‘s car pulls up outside and he climbs out surveying the
deserted main street

A church clock tower at the end of the street casts its
twilight shadow across vacant windows and faceless store
fronts
FEMALE VOICE (0S)
Never shut up do ya

Jamie spins around startled to see an elderly woman sitting
on a rocking chair outside the funeral home She is cradling
a dead raven in her hands

JAMIE
Excuse me

She holds the raven up and we realize she is talking to it

ELDERLY WOMAN
Always hungry always want
something It‘s okay Best pet I
ever had you are

The door to the funeral home opens and HENRY WALKER steps
out

HENRY
Mister Ashen

JAMIE
Yes
HENRY
I‘ve been expecting you Please

Jamie follows him in watching the woman wnisper te herself
in the chair oblivious to Jamies presence

INT OFFICE WALKER FUNERAL HOME - DUSK
Cluttered Must be a busy time

Henry sorts through papers at his desk He is a good man in
bad job with a nervous smile A worrier

Jamie sits opposite Henry speaks to him in a hushed tone
that Jamie will experience with everyone he meets in Ravens
Fair

HENRY
You you must excuse Marion my
sister She’s not well but she
didn’t mean any harm

JAMIE

CUT TO
EXT “COME IN INN’ MOTEL - NIGHT

The motel sign sways in the wind the word VACANCY’ spelied
out in big black letters

INT FRONT OFFICE COME ON INN MOTEL - NIGHT
The office is empty

Jamie waits A sign on the desk says Ring Bell For
Attendance’ He does - but the bell doesn’t make a sound

He taps it a few more times Nothing Perplexed he picks it
up inspecting it A figure appears from a back room
carrying something

JAMIE
Excuse me Sir

The man emerges from behind the counter walking straight
past Jamie towards the door He looks like an elementary
schooi librarian Jamie stops him

JAMIE
Do you work here

The man nods
JAMIE
Okay so can I get a room for the
night

The man shakes his head

JAMIE
Are you joking

The man shakes his head again Jamie is agitated city-
slicker style

JAMIE
Well the sign out the front says
vacancy

The man just stares at Jamie
JAMIE

What the hells wrong with you man
Aren’t you gonna say anything

The man holds up what he is carrying It 1s a square of white
tin Stenciled on it in big black ietters is the word NO

With that the man exits Jamie is dumbstruck He qoes
window watching the wiry man scale a ladder and begin
slotting the NO sign in front of tne word VACANCY

Jamie sees another figure emerge from one of the motel rooms

unloading cases from a car Jamie squints at him
It is DETECTIVE LIPTON

Time for plan B

EXT ASHEN HOUSE - NIGHT

Pale headlights arc across a wrought-iron gate

Jamie‘s car pulls up He climbs out

An ageing mansion looms beyond the gate the grounds around
it carpeted by a lazy fog Its moss-soaked spires and arched
windows suggest an atmosphere one could coin “House Of Usher-

esque’

Jamie STARTS as a figure emerges from the shadows a hulking
man all shoulders Cro-Magnon brow This is the maintenance
Man BOZ (30s) He is holding an oil can He begins to oil

the hinges on the gate His arms are covered in grease

JAMIE

Hey Boz it’s been a while
BOZ

Yeah
JAMIE

Good to see you’re still working
here at night

BOZ
Yeah

JAMIE
Patrolling the grounds keeping
them safe from large dangerous
men

Boz doesn’t quite get it He pulls on the gate which opens

without making a noise

EXT ASHEN HOUSE -— NIGHT

Jamie ambles up the garden path towards the front door
shivering in the cold

He reaches the front door hesitating He knocks on it with
the big brass DOOR KNOCKER at its center Bad decision Too
late

The door opens revealing ELLA ASHEN (late 30’s) She is the
ultimate trophy wife sexy yet not so young and dumb that
the pool man thinks he has a shot She smiles warmly

ELLA
Well this is a surprise

Jamie clearly has no idea who this person is

ELLA
I’m so sorry about what happened I
can’t imagine how you must be
feeling right now

Jamie looks a little awkward

ELLA
Oh my Lord you must think Im so
rude

She curtsies’ and offers her hand all charm-school manners
and southern traditions

ELLA
I’m Elia Im yourwell I guess
I‘m your step-mother

Jamie shakes her hand

JAMIE
Nice to meet you I’m Jamie

ELLA
I know I’ve seen your pictures
Though you look much more handsome
in the flesh

JAMIE
Thanks

(beat)
Is he in

ELLA
Is who Oh of course Yes he
ais Silly me
NO
i

An awkward moment

JAMIE
May I come in

Ella cocks her head in mock disbelief then steps outside
standing next to Jamie

ELLA
On the contrary my dear it is I

who should be asking you if I can
enter your home

JAMIE
Sure

INT ENTRANCE HALL ASHEN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Jamie shuffles through the door Ella behind him He surveys
the cavernous surroundings

Oil paintings of stern figures glare down at him between
wall mounted lamps that cast dim pools of light

Ella shuts the door

i ELLA
Its freezing out there

A VOICE booms from upstairs We recognize it as the voice
from the phone call with Jamie

MANS VOICE (0S)
Who was that at the door

Ella looks to Jamie

ELLA
Would you like to see him

JAMIE
Well I’ve heard him now and I can
smell him Why not ruin one more of
my senses

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY ASHEN HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Ella leads Jamie down a narrow corridor
ELLA
I have to warn you he’s been very

sick He would have looked a lot
better the last time you saw him

JAMIE
I probably looked a lot better
twelve years ago too

ELLA
‘Thats how long it’s been since you
two saw each other
JAMIE
Yeah I didn’t even know hed
remarried to be honest
Ella can‘t tell if Jamie is sad about this or noc
They reach a door and stop

ELLA
Well again I have to warn you You
might be more shocked than you
think at hisappearance
(beat)
I‘1l tell him youre here
She takes out a key unlocking the door

She enters and closes the door behind her We hear her
talking to someone then

ELLA (0S)
Come on in Jamie

Jamie opens the door

INT MASTER BEDROOM ASHEN HOUSE CONTINUOUS

The theme of the house continues - it‘s dark in here
Jamie takes in the room - and finds what he’s looking for
Ella was right

A gaunt male figure is propped up in a WHEELCHAIR in the

corner A plastic respirator covers his mouth from which he -

draws staggered rasping breaths His hands are clawed as if
his whole body was drying up

This is CHARLES ASHEN(late 50s) Jamie‘s father
Ella is seated next to him
Jamie stands like he’s in the principals office He doesn’t

ever look his father in the eye a habit he will continue
throughout this entire story

JAMIE
Hello Charles

Charles speaks in a militarily stern manner struggling to
get thewords out”
CHARLES
It‘s a shame that it takes a

tragedy to put us under the same
roof again

ELLA
Charlie that’s not the issue Your
son is here

CHARLES
I know he is and don‘t call me
Charlie in front of him

ELLA
Quiet Charlie Don’t make me wheel
- you into the closet and leave you
there again

Charles grumbles
CHARLES
‘ (to Jamie)
I assume youve met my wife

ELLA
Why don’t you sit Jamie

Jamie shakes his head

JAMIE
I always had to stand in front of
father

CHARLES

Nothing wrong with standing Thats
something you only appreciate after
a stroke forces you to stay seated

Jamie looks around Takes a seat across the room from
Charles

JAMIE
Thanks for the charity with the
funeral

CHARLES

Don’t mention it

JAMIE
ZI only mention it because I’m not
accepting it

CHARLES
‘And why is that

JAMIE
Because Lisa was my wife and I
lived with her and loved her and
I‘m going to be the one who pays
for her funeral So thanks but no
thanks

CHARLES
I don’t see why I cant help

JAMIE
It’s got nothing to do with you

Ella SMILING as always tries to break the heated moment

ELLA
Charlie I was just telling Jamie
how the photos you have of him
don’t do him enough justice

Neither Jamie nor Charles seem to hear this

CHARLES
I’ve been trying to reach you
Leaving messages at your house

JAMIE
Yes I know

CHARLES
I’m glad that in light of what’s
happened you haven‘t let our past
stop you from seeing reason this
time

JAMIE
Well the only motel in town was
all booked up so
Ella lights up

ELLA
Then youre staying the weekend

Jamie doesn’t answer

CHARLES
Actually Ella and would like you
to stay longer than one weekend
Wed like you to stay for as long
as you can

JAMIE
I can’t
CHARLES
And why not
JAMIE
I have to go back home and help the
police
CHARLES

Surely you can at least stay the
week To clear your head

JAMIE
Why the sudden need for me to stay
here

CHARLES

We just feel that in light of
what’s happened now would be a
good time toresolve some things

Jamies voice goes up an octave frustrated

JAMIE
Now would probably be the worst
time to do that

He sighs calming down

JAMIE
Look I’m thinking it was a mistake
coming here I’m thinking I should
just stay somewhere else

Jamie gets up and walks towards the door

CHARLES
I bet there’s a whole lot of things
your wife wanted to do with her
life A whole list of things she
thought she had years to mark off

Jamie spins around angry
CHARLES (CONTD)
Me Ive got the luxury of
foresight I’ve got time to examine
my list before I go

JAMIE
Well take me off it You don’t get
a ‘get-out-of-jail-free’ card just
because you had a stroke

(beat)
Goodbye Ella It was nice meeting
you

He storms out
INT UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR ASHEN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Jamie peels out into the corridor Ella comes after him

ELLA
Jamie he didn’t mean to upset you
Please would you stay one night

JAMIE
I’ve been here ten minutes and Im
already up to my knees in bad
memories Why would I stay the
night and get in up to my chin

ELLA
It hasn’t been all bad You’ve also
Made a new friend in the last ten
minutes

She approaches him takes his hand

ELLA (CONTD)
And Ive had the chance to meet
someone Ive been hearing so many
great things about

Jamie pulls his hand away

JAMIE
Now I know you‘’re bull-shitting
The father I grew up with would
never say great things about me

ELLA
Yes but an old man whose brain is
shutting down from mini-strokes
would

Jamie looks away ashamed

ELLA
You have all the power here You
can walk out but he can‘t come

stay and show him that the young
boy who left here is now a strong-
willed young man

She‘s got him
INT JAMIE’S BEDROOM ASHEN HOUSE - NIGHT

Ella flicks on the light revealing a musty bedroom filled
with furniture draped in WHITE SHEETS

Jamie flings his suitcase onto the bed along with the box
the ventriloquist doll came in Looks around More bad
memories

ELLA
Try to get some sleep Jamie

She suddenly steps towards him and EMBRACES him He helf
accepts the hug half doesn’t

They separate
ELLA
I‘m 60 glad to finally meet you
I’m just sorry it had to happen
this way
She leaves shutting the door behind her
Jamie explores the room noticing something odd -

There are bars on the windows Beyond the glass he sees Boz
padlocking the gate

Boz looks up as if he knew someone were watching him Finds
Jamie and stares straight at him

Jamie pulls the drapes closed
EXT MAIN STREET RAVENS FAIR - NIGHT
All is quiet in Raven‘’s Fair

The CLOCK FACE on the CHURCH TOWER in the town square hits
midnight

There are no bells or chimes to accompany it
INT BASEMENT WORKROOM WALKER FUNERAL HOME NIGHT

A body bag is laying out on a workbench

Henry hobbles up to it uncoiling tubes of embalming fluid
Just another day at the office

He unzips the bag --

-- and FREEZES The sight is like a slug to the gut
Inside the bag we SEE LISAS FACE It looks exactly as it
did when Jamie found her - eyes wrenched skyward face
twisted into a permanent scream tongueless mouth gaping

open Eerie

A flash of RECOGNITION flares across Henrys face A » long
beat passes

MARION (0S)
Shes arrived

Henry STARTS - looking up to see Marion standing in the
darkness under the stairs staring at Lisa‘s body

HENRY
I need to work now Marion

Marion leaves walking up the stairs

Finally Henry moves He goes to a drawer taking out a
Polaroid camera

He aims it at Lisa’s face depressing the trigger
The white flash transposes into--
EXT ASHEN HOUSE - NIGHT

-- a bloated moon It hangs over the house back-lighting its
gothic peaks

INT JAMIES BEDROOM ASHEN HOUSE - NIGHT

Blades of moonlight slice through the open window The lace
curtains swell and settle in the breeze

The ventriloquist dummy is propped up in a chair in the
corner its head facing the window

Jamie is wide awake staring at a photo of Lisa The look in
his eyes is one of PURE FEAR

INT JAMIES APARTMENT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

Lisa’s face FLASHES in Jamie’s mind blood dribbling down her
chin eyes wrenched skyward

---dead
INT JAMIE‘S BEDROOM ASHEN HOUSE - NIGHT PRESENT

He lowers the photo taking a deep breath and pinching the
bridge of his nose Is he going crazy

He pries his eyes open and sees a cockroach skitter across
the ceiling above hin

A whisper slithers from out of the darknessso soft it
could almost be the breeze playing tricks

VOICE Jamieyou’re home

It sounded like Lisa Jamie looks up

And GASPS

The dummy has moved to the other side of the room

Jamie flicks on the bedside lamp

In the light he sees that it was just a mirror its
reflection showing the dummy - which is still sitting in its
original position by the windowexcept for one detail

The dummy is now facing him

Jamie gets up slowly Picks up the doll Its head slumps
forward onto its chest

He sits it back in the chair throwing a portionof one of
the white sheets over it Covering it up like a ghost

Breathing hard and shaking he shuts the window Keeps his
eyes on the doll

Behind him beneath the bedroom door the shadow of someones
FEET moves away down the hall

EXT CEMETERY - DAY

Grey headstones merge with the grey sky The last leaves of
fall scatter in fear of the oncoming winter

A dozen or so mourners hunch together around Lisas plot
including Ella Charles is not here

A shovel load of dirt is heaped onto the casket Jamie sits
in a chair watching the black lid disappear under the wormy
soil Everyone stands opposite him except Ella who stands
directly behind him her face veiled in black lace

A priest stands over the grave muttering something so low
that we CANNOT HEAR IT

Jamie scans the faces of the other attendees

None of them cry or make a soundbut they are all staring
at him

Jamie looks away and spots DETECTIVE LIPTON in the distance
standing by a tree

Watching

The priest raises his voice ever so slightly enough that we
can finally hear something he is saying

PRIEST
-and we look to our families and
loved ones for solace
Ella puts her hands on Jamie’s shoulders
EXT CEMETERY - LATER — DAY
Jamie drifts away from the crowd
Sees Lipton walking away and hurries to catch him
JAMIE
Detective Lipton

Lipton stops and turns

JAMIE (CONT’D)
How are you

LIPTON

and say anything I thought Id
leave you alone

lw
i)

JAMIE
That’s okay
(peat overly hostile)
Detective if you don’t mind me
asking why are you here

Lipton studies Jamie gauging his suspicion

LIPTON
For most people a funeral is
closure For a homicide detective
it’s a starting point

JAMIE

Okay Seen anything interesting
LIPTON

Not yet but I‘m still looking

(beat )
She deserves that don’t you think

Jamie nods He’s right

JAMIE
I just didn’t expect you to show up
all the way down here

LIPTON
I didn’t come for fun kiddo I’m
here for-the same reason plumber’s
hang around broken toilets a lot

He walks away then stops and turns around

LIPTON
Ill be seeing you

Jamie watches the detective stroll away

FEMALE VOICE (0S)
She lost her voice

Jamie turns seeing MARION - Henry’s sister from the funeral -
home She steps closer to him FEAR in her eyes

MARION (CONTD)
Mary Shawshe lost her voice
Then she came back to claim ours

She points at an old headstone which is partly obscured by
trees away from the other headstones Her voice grows in
volume

MARION
Mary Shaw did iz Shes the one who
steals tongues

Jamie’s BLOOD FREEZES when he hears this

JAMIE
What did you say

Marion points at the headstone her voice growing louder and
more fearful

MARION
And if those people
who saw her did scream
their tongues would be gone -
ripped out clean

Henry appears taking Marion by the arms roughly

HENRY
Marion what are you doing Leave
him alone You know better than
this

(beat)

I‘m sorry Mister Ashen she
doesn’t know what she’s saying I
apologize sir

Henry leads her away berating her under his breath

Jamie still in shock looks to the headstone she had been
pointing at

It has decayed with age vines strangling it

Etched into the rock the words HERE LIES MARY SHAW
INT DINING ROOM ASHEN HOUSE NIGHT

This family dinner is very workman-like chew swallow

Candlelight dances across the walls as Ella spoon-feeds a
very gruel-like substance to Charles at the head of a long
oak dining table Jamie sits opposite eyes down Finally

ELLA

Jamie pokes at his meal - a soppy and badiy cooked roast

Jamie slams his fork down Blank looks from Ella and Charles

JAMIE
I can’t stay

He gets up and leaves
EXT ASHEN HOUSE - NIGHT
Jamie charges out of the front door breathing hard

A figure catches in his peripheral vision and he stops in his
tracks

It is Boz in the distance He is talking to someone at the
front gate Jamie squints at the second figure through the
fog

Detective Lipton

Jamie hides himself behind a branch Watches the exchange
between the two men too far away to hear anything”

Boz nods and Lipton takes a note
Jamie backs up slowlyback into the house
INT BATHROOM ASHEN HOUSE - NIGHT

Jamie splashes water on his face shaken He has the look of
a first-day prison inmate - a man with no escape

He looks up into the mirror and is STARTLED to see CHARLES
sitting in his wheelchair at the opposite end of the
corridor

CHARLES
I‘m sorry I have to learn that
you’re a man now You don’t need me
telling you how to run your life

A long beat passes hetween them

CHARLES
You know I did used to make
enquiries about you after you left
I had my sources People would
always tell me that you were happy
‘that you were doing well I never
wanted to interrupt that
Jamie nods growing more disturbed by his father’s truce’

CHARLES
Good-night son

The wheelchair retreats and is swallowed up by the darkness
the screech of its wheels receding in volume as it moves
away

EXT ASHEN HOUSE NIGHT

The witching hour

Storm clouds roll in low growls of thunder announcing their
arrival

Beneath the brooding sky only one arched window in the house
remains lit It switches off

INT ENTRANGE HALL ASHEN HOUSE - NIGHT

The curtains lull gently the only thing moving in the
darkness

Dripdripdrip

INT CORRIDOR ASHEN HOUSE - SAME

A grandfather clock ticks

INT JAMIE’S BEDROOM ASHEN HOUSE SAME

Jamie is asleep A bottle of sleeping pills sits on the
pedside table tablets scattered around it

For a moment it is only Jamie’s steady rhythmic breathing
we can hear

but then another sound is introduced

At first it could be Jamie -- until it drowns him out
Sobbing

Jamie‘seyes flutter open He tunes in to the guttural moans
His vision adjusts in the darkness scanning the room past
the door past the furniture covered in white sheets until
they STOP DEAD on something

A figure is hunched over in the corner by the window
whimpering its back to Jamie The figure’s head rests in its
hands - MIRRORING the image we saw of Mary crying in the
opening scenes

Jamie BOLTS upright in bed adrenaline kicking in

He glares at the figure for a long beat

JAMIE
Ella

Immediately the sobbing CEASES and the figure stands up
turning around to face Jamie

Shrouded in shadow it resembles an OLD WOMAN - her pale face
catching what little light there is

‘A sudden gust of wind sends the drapes billowing outwards
obscuring the woman

Only the old womans eyes pierce through the sheer lace
fabric eerily WIDE and unblinking Staring right at Jamie
Then

-the drapes settle and she is GONE

Heart in his throat Jamie switches on the bedside lamp and
gets out of bed going over to the window He checks all
corners finding nothing

BANG

The doll falls out of its chair splaying across the floor

Jamie picks it up As he lifts it he sees a faded
inscription on the back of the doll’s neck

It reads M SHAW

INT ENTRANCE HALL ASHEN HOUSE - MORNING

The house awakens

Jamie descends the stairs quickly heading for the front

door

He catches sight of Ella who is busying herself in the

kitchenwith pots and pans
ELLA
Oh Jamie youre up Would you
like some breakfast

JAMIE
No that’s okay

ELLA
Are you going somewhere

He doesn‘t answer
EXT ASHEN HOUSE - MORNING
The sun rises over Ashen House for a new day

Jamie flings open the front door rushing towards his
then stops in his tracks

A FALLEN TREE is blocking the driveway
Boz hacks away at it with a saw

Jamie approaches

Ella appears in the doorway

ELLA
Jamie can I get you to help me
with something I’m just not as
strong as I used to be

A twinge of nervousness spreads across Jamie’s face He looks
from Ella to the gate like a trapped animal He chooses the
front gate

JAMIE

I-I wouldbut I have to go
somewhere

ELLA
Well when will you be back I’m
coy making lunch
Jamie quickéns his pace not looking back
JAMIE

Boz and Ella watch him go
EXT FOREST ROAD - DAY

Jamie marches skittishly down a winding tree-lined road a
vein cut through the heart of the forest by men

The forest does its best to claim the land back gnarled
branches over-hanging it and trapping a MIST that keeps Jamie
from seeing too far ahead of himself

He keeps going anyway

EXT VARIOUS STREETS RAVENS FAIR - DAY

through the streets of Ravens Fair past quaint houses
that have seen better days

He looks over at a group of children playing together on a
street corner as children doexcept for one thing

They sing under their breath not making a sound

EXT WALKER FUNERAL HOME RAVENS FAIR’S MAIN STREET - DAY
Marion sits in her chair cradling her crow

Jamie approaches She doesn’t seem to notice

He kneels down apprehensive

JAMIE
Ma‘amI have to talk to you

She strokes the head of the dead bird smiling
JAMIE
You said something to me about my
wife yesterdayyou said a woman
named Mary Shaw did it
Marion looks up slowly

Leans forward and whispers in Jamie’s ear

MARION
She’s standing right behind you

As much as we can actually SEE a shiver run down someones

spine we see it with Jamie
He turns around No one is there
He grips Marion’s shoulder - desperation in his eyes

JAMIE
Who is she Tell me

HENRY (0S)
Mister Ashen I would prefer it if
you left her alone

Jamie STARTS as Henry interrupts He stands up dejected
backing away from Marion

INT WALKER FUNERAL HOME - DAY

Henry peers through the shop-front window then flips the
“OPEN sign to “CLOSED locking the door

He begins pulling the blinds closed

HENRY
There are things you remember and
there are things you cant forget

Jamie sits in an old armchair listening attentively

HENRY (CONT’D)

Despite the inarguable fact that I
am getting on in years I remember
a lot of things from my life
Remember them well in fact

He turns to face Jamie

HENRY (CONT’D)

But the look on old Mary Shaws
face when she diedthat’s
something I just can’t forget

Henry paces the room nervous as ever
’

HENRY (CONT’D)

What would you say if I told you
that sixty years agoin this

said it could become a boomtown a
real cultural hot-spot And so
somebody built a grand old theater
on the edge of town

INT AUDITORIUM GUIGNOL THEATER - NIGHT -- FLASHBACK

A cocky young boy of about ten maneuvers his way through the
plush seats of the auditorium This is YOUNG HENRY

Young Henry finds his seat settling on one near the front

HENRY (V0)
I only ever went there once

The lights fade in the auditorium

A spotlight comes on singling out an old man in a bright red
suit standing on the stage It is MARYS HUSBAND whom we
met in the opening scenes

MARYS HUSBAND
Ladies and gentlemen prepare to be
astoundedprepare to be
amazedwitness Mary Shaw give
life to the boy made of wood

The spotlight switches off Mary’s husband leaves the stage

Henry squints at the stage seeing a figure which’ limps out
from behind the curtain shrouded in shadow The screech of
something heavy the figure is dragging pierces the hush

The figure stops at the lip of the stage

A spotlight illuminates the figure It is an old woman her
angular features sticking out like accusatory fingers a
shock of white hair framing her face This is MARY SHAW

She bends down unlocking the large wooden trunk she was
dragging and heaving the lid upwards She removes a top hat
from the trunk and then rolls the trunk onto its side - it is
empty

MARY SHAW
Where is Billy

She casts a suspicious eye over the audience

MARY SHAW
Have any of you seen him Was it
you who let him out

She begins to potter around the stage searching hagh and
low

MARY SHAW
Billy Where did you go Billy

VOICE You won’t find me

Henry JUMPS out of his skin as the voice screams out -- from
RIGHT BEHIND HIM He whirls around heart in his throat No
one is there

Mary whips her head up shielding her eyes from the flare of
the spotlight

MARY SHAW
I knew you were hiding

She makes out Henry a few rows from the front
‘ MARY SHAW
You there could you check under
your seat for me
Henry reluctantly gets up peeking under his seat
The cherubic’ face of a VENTRILOQUIST’S DUMMY stares back at
him with the vacant gaze of the dead Mouth stretched into a

grin It is a dummy we know well

YOUNG HENRY
Hes here

MARY SHAW
Would you mind bringing him to me

Henry hauls the dummy out from under the seat carrying him
up the aisle to the stage Mary takes the dummy in her arms

MARY SHAW
Say thank you Billy

The dummy’s head swivels around slowly to face Henry

BILLY
Thank you

Henry returns to his seat Mary takes her place on a stool
the dummy’s head lolling back and forth as she props him up
on her lap placing the top hat on his head 7

MARY SHAW
Why must you run away Billy Don‘t
I treat you well

As he talks the dummy’‘s jaw lowers and shuts vigorousiy

BILLY
You do treat me well mother The
best I could ever hope for Its
just that

MARY SHAW
Yes Billy

BILLY
Well it’s just thatit gets so
dusty inside that box It makes me
want to

MARY SHAW
Want to what

Billy leans back as if he is about to sneeze

BILLY
It makes me want to

Mary whips the handkerchief out of his top pocket holding it

up to his nose

BILLY
Ahhhh-chooosco

As he sneezes the handkerchief blows outwards propelled by
the force of the sneeze

The audience laughs and claps

MARY SHAW
Bleechhh Shoe

BILLY
Bless me

MARY SHAW

No I said Bleechhh--

She holds up her foot

MARY SHAW (CONT’D)
--shoe You sneezed all over my
shoe

The audience laughs again
BILLY
I’m sorry for that mother I--

VOICE (0S)
T can see your lips move

Mary and Billy stop their act and turn to face the accusing

audience The moment hangs in silence for a beat

MARY SHAW
Whe said that

At first no one admits ituntil a red-headed boy of about

ten pipes up from a middle row

RED-HEADED BOY
I did I saw your lips moving

MARY SHAW
What do you say to that Billy He
doesnt think youre a real person
BILLY
What do you mean mother

Mary keeps her eyes fixed on the boy Her and Billy’s voices
have lowered With his new less sprightly tone Billy’s grin

now seems malevolent

MARY SHAW
He thinks you‘re a dummy and that
Im doing your voice for you

BILLY
Butbut that can’t be true
(beat)
Theres no way you’d give me ALL
the good lines

Laughter from everyone

MARY SHAW
Just forget about him Billy There
will always be doubters

48

BILLY
I don’t want to forget it mother
I think we should show this boy
that I‘m real

MARY SHAW
No Im afraid we must go on with
the show

BILLY

I refuse to go on until he believes
that I’m real

Mary and Billy‘s shouting begins to OVERLAP

BILLY MARY SHAW
Let me go mother I just want No Sit still child Do you
to talk to him I want to hear me

teach him

The audience break into applause amazed by the performance
all except Henry who shrinks back in his seat afraid

The clapping dissipates and Mary turns to face the red-
headed boy Her eyes DRILL into his a grin spreading slowly
across her face

MARY SHAW
Now whos the dummy

looks away Tne officer lowers the sheet handing a thick
contract to Richard

He turns on his heel leaving as if he couldn’‘t get out of
there fast enough Henry slinks back into the shadows
watching him go by

is Billy the dummy Eyes staring off at the far wall
Henry takes a few paces inside Keeps watching the dummy
Lightning blinks in the window casting long shadows

He edges closer reaching the bench

He gets up on his toes placing his hands on the edge of the
coffin

He glances over at the dummy It hasn‘t moved

He hauls himself up straining to get a lookinside the
coffin
The light flicks on

EXT WALKER FUNERAL HOME - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Jamie steps out onto the street Looks both ways as if
searching for a cab

JAMIE
God damn it I need my car

MARION (0S)
You can take ours

Jamie whirls around to’ see Marion dangling a set of car keys

MARION (CONTD)
Henry doesn’t let me drive

INT WALKER FUNERAL HOME - DAY
Henry watches through the window as a monstrous black HEARSE
speeds off down the main street of Ravens Fair

HENRY

Son of a
Jamie is behind the wheel
EXT DIRT ROAD - DAY

Jamie pilots the hearse along an offthemap road that is
bordered by towering trees

Speckles of sunlight dapple the windshield peeking through
the branches

Jamie slows down seeing an old weatherboard house on his
left

INT WEATHERBOARD HOUSE - SAME

Behind a grimy pane of glass that passes for a window we see
the hearse roll past the house

Someone is WATCHING through a chink in the curtain

The dark figure turns going over to a phone and dialing

INT HEARSE - SAME

Jamie continues along the road which gets darker as the
foliage overhead thickens

The dirt turns to mud squelching beneath the tires The road
narrows

Jamie glances over through the passenger window then turns
back --

-- and hits the BRAKES

He has reached a DEAD END At least that’s what the sign
says The sign also says PRIVATE PROPERTY’

Below these words someone has spray-painted NO ONE GOES
INNO ONE COMES OUT’

Trees block the road behind the sign like giant wooden
sentry’s

EXT ROADSIDE - DAY
Jamie steps out of his car

He moves past the sign clawing through the thick brush and
stumbling out onto --

-- the shore of a swampy lake

A sodden makeshift jetty juts out over the water - all that
remains of the footbridge that once ran to the theater A
small boat is lashed to it with a frayed rope

In the center of the lake is an island and on that island
--is the Guignol Theater

A lone crow caws in the distance

Jamie steps out into the boat It rocks as he sits in it He
unties the rope and begins rowing out towards the island

EXT GUIGNOL THEATER DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Jamie alights the boat tying it to a stake then stares up
in awe at the building before him

Like an aging former movie-star you can still glimpse the
glory behind the brittle bones Tall and imposing it is
obvious someone put a lot of work into this place but nature
has stripped away her dignity

He approaches the building

Nothing appears to grow on the island - all the «rees are
skeletal relics tortured into impossible shapes by starvation

Dead ravens litter the ground as if some sort of bird
holocaust had occurred

Jamie steps up to the double doors and then sees somethinc
on the ground below him

A footprint

It’s recent the mad fading but still clear enough te make
out

The footprints lead to the door Jamie knocks on it
lightlyand it groans open

Somebody has already been here

INT AUDITORIUM GUIGNOL THEATER - DAY

Inside is the same story as out - a palace once grand now
derelict A curtain of red velvet hangs across the stage
once regal now moth-eaten

Jamie makes his way down the aisle scanning around

Shards of sunlight cut in from outside highlighting ornately
sculpted statues that gape down at Jamie from the corners of
the high ceiling above a huge audience balcony

He reaches the stage clambering up onto it

He looks around the auditorium Not a hint of movement All
that we can hear is his quivering breath

He steps behind the curtain

IWl STAGE GUIGNOL THEATER - CONTINUOUS

It has been a long time since anyone trod these boards

An old piano at the side of the stage is ail that remains
Jamie lifts the key cover tapping a few of the keys The
sound is eerily discordant neglected by time Matches the

feeling in here

Jamie paces around the stage seeing a pile of wooden planks
in one corner

Co

in
wo

He looks up into the lighting rigs high above him spotting a
door which is slightly ajar Nailed across the door are a few
random wooden planks most of which have been torn away

Somebody has already been here

The only way to reach the door is across a narrow catwalk
which runs over the stage like a suspension bridge

Jamie finds a set of stairs which lead up into the lights He
ascends them vertigo setting in as he sees the stage below

At the top of the stairs he takes a tentative step onto the
rickety catwalk then scampers quickly across it

He pushes the door open
INT PASSAGEWAY GUIGNOL THEATER - CONTINUOUS

--entering a short passageway with a rounded door at the end
of it

Jamie advances reaching the door and trying the handle It
opens

INT MARYS LIVING AREA GUIGNOL THEATER - CONTINUOUS
He crouches through the portal into a squalid living area

Pale shafts of light filter through a window showing Jamie a
small dinner table with a crude kitchen in the corner
quilted in spider-webs

In another corner a threadbare mattress and sheet next to
which is a STAGE-MIRROR framed by light-bulbs MAKE-UP is
spread out on the table beneath the mirror

A shelf on one wall is crowded with assorted junk among it
dozens of STUFFED ANIMALS SEWING KITS NEEDLES and JARS OF
EMBALMING FLUID

Jamie goes to the shelf picking up a taxidermic BLACK CAT -
face frozen in mid-hiss Yellow eyes glaring

He searches the shelf further finding a small doll wearing
an old fashioned dress One of its eyes is missing

His fingers find a string at the back He yanks it anda
voice croaks to life age slowing it down to a masculine
drawl

DOLL
Mommy
Creeped out Jamie looks up from the doll --

--and GASPS

Reflected in the stage-mirror strung up in a noose and tied
to a beam - STARING at him with bulging eyes - is the figure
of MARY SHAW

Jamie WHIRLS -- seeing nothing Whips back o the mirror --
she is gone

Jamies chest heaves the shock still COURSING through him
He pokes the mirror nervously

»then notices something in the reflection
A wooden trunk in the corner behind him

He goes over to it The chest has been thrown open its lock
shattered Rosary beads are scattered around it

‘Jamie peers into it
A tattered TOP HAT sits inside itand nothing else

The top hat is lined with a red velvet that matches the suit
Billy wears

An axe lies strewn next to the trunk It looks brand new

Jamie wipes sweat from his brow examining the axe blade He
smiles

EXT LAKE — DAY

Jamie rows back across the lake The axe lies in the boat
next to him wrapped in a rag

He looks up seeing four figures standing on the shore

JAMIE
Shit

It is a man in Sheriff’s uniform an unidentified woman
Henry --

-- and Lipton
EXT LAKE SHORE - MOMENTS LATER

The woman AUDREY (30s) rushes up to meet the boat as it

arrives

AUDREY

The sheriff spins him around slapping cuffs on
SHERIFF (CONTD)

Jamie looks around at the group

JAMIE

LIPTON

JAMIE

Lipton smiles

LIPTON
No

“We save the chair for wife killers

Jamie LUNGES at him With his hands cuffed Lipton easily
side steps KICKING Jamie in the back

Jamie lands face down in the mud with a SMACK Lipton dr-ves
a knee into his back

LIPTON
Assaulting an officer resisting
arrest - youre writing a shopping
list here buddy

He grabs Jamie’s hair yanking his head up

LIPTON
What the hell are you doing up

JAMIE

I’m trying to find out what
happened to Lisa which seems to be
more than you‘re doing

LIPTON
Oh really Well right now I’m on

LIPTON

Everyone looks to Henry

HENRY

JAMIE

Henry turns to the Sheriff
HENRY
The last time I spoke to him was

when we were arranging the funeral

JAMIE
Youre a liar

Lipton eases off Jamie’s back watching all this with
interest The Sheriff hoists Jamie to his feet

SHERIFF

You know what you said to me

SHERIFF

Lipton picks up the axe examining it

LIPTON

The Sheriff gives Jamie the once over

SHERIFF

He closes the door
INT JAMIE’S CAR MOVING - NIGET

Jamie steers the car through black oblivion pushing it to
its limits

Flying past the windows are the darkened streets of Ravens
Fair

Not a soul can be seen anywhere The town is lonelythe
wind its only tenant

Jamie slows the car to a stop his mania subsiding He
collapses onto the steering wheel as a clap of thunder roars
its disapproval from the sky

Finally he looks up staring at something through the
windshield atop a hill on the towns highest ground

The cemetery
CUT TO
INT LIPTON’S ROOM ‘COME ON INN’ MOTEL - NIGHT

A frenzied symphony reaches its crescendo on a tinny radio in
the corner

Lipton fixes a pair of reading glasses to his face scanning
the fax papers he received

What he DOESN’T SEE is the EYE of the ventriloquist’s dummy
move toward him

Glaring at him
Lipton glancés over at the dummy
Its eyes are facing front again

Lipton goes back to the fax papersand this time we see
what he doesn’t notice in his peripheral vision

The dummies whole head TURNS TO FACE HIM

Lipton looks upbut its not the dummy that has gotten his
attention - its a sound

A VOICE

Lipton follows the whisper - it’s coming from behind a
cabinet

Lipton snatches up his gun Cocks it

LIPTON
Who is that Who‘s there

He approaches the cabinet heaving it aside --

-- and revealing a small wooden door about waist-height
He grabs a flashlight from the desk crouching down
He opens the crawispace door

Slowly

Carefully

He stares into the pitch-black square of darkness beyond the
door

LIPTON
Identify yourself

He wriggles his way into the crawlspace

INT CRAWLSPACE COME ON INN’ MOTEL - CONTINUOS

He lashes the flashlight in all directions

Undefined objects clutter the space Rotted wooden pillars
support the low-ceiling running the entire length of the -
building

LIPTON
Who’s there

Lipton crawls forth his hands crunching in the gravel
Suddenly --

-- the door shuts behind him

Lipton rushes to it smashing on it

LIPTON
God damn it this isnt funny

He STOPS abruptly Feels something behind him
A presence

He whirls around aiming his flashlight into the inky void--
nothing moves but the shadows cast by its light

He turns around again jerking on the door
As he does the feeling looms behind him again RISING

He stops Then spins around--

-COMING FACE-TO-FACE WITH THE GHOULISHLY PAINTED VISAGE oF
MARY SHAW -- so close he can smell her rotten breath her
eyes burning like candle flames in open wounds

He REELS back in fright smashing into a pile of stacked up
junk The’flashlight falls out of his hand cutting out

TOTAL BLACKNESS once again
We hear Lipton clawing at the gravel Terror in his voice

LIPTON
Jesus fucking Christ

For a moment only the wooden beams around him reply
creaking under their own weight

-«-until a sickening SNORT erupts - right next to Lipton

He fires his gun -- each shot illuminating the nightmare
vision of Mary Shawcrawling toward himunaffected by the
gunfire

Smiling

Lipton’s gun clicks empty and he SCREAMS

We hear the’sound of his scream being CUT SHORT -- followed
by the wet throaty sound of his tongue being RIPPED OUT

For a moment all we hear is Lipton gurgling sucking in
short breaths They decrease in volume as his life
fadesand then we hear Mary Shaw
She is whispering to Lipton -- IN HIS OWN VOICE

A bloodied hand spears out of the CRAWLSPACE door grabbing
at the carpet It hauls a body forward - LIPTONS bodv

He gags lurching forward on his hands and knees clinging to
life He claws his way out of the crawlspace towards the
phone

«until his body gives in and collapses under him

Then-

--a light falls across his face as the door opens Lipton’s
eyes widen in terror as a shadow falls across him

An UNSEEN figure is entering his hotel room

Lipton follows the figure with his eyes blood seeping from
within his mouth

The UNSEEN intruder picks up the doll calmly pausing to
stand over Lipton

He makes a noise all that his tongueless mouth will allow a
throaty bark from deep within his gut The last noise he will
ever make

And with that the UNSEEN figure leaves taking the doll

The door closes

There are no other cars or signs of life

Twigs crunch underfoot as Jamie steps out onto the lake

A thick MIST hangs over the water like a vaporous blankex
obscuring any view of the island at its center

Next to the boat an old gas lantern hangs on a post the
flame inside flickering Jamie takes it and steps into the
boat

He pushes off from the jetty The mist envelopes him

As he rows towards the theater the soft glow of the lantern
floating through the thick fog is all that we can make out

JAMIE
Hold on a minute

AUDREY

JAMIE

Cy

AUDREY
You don’t know what youve done
boy Coming in here Disturbing the
place

JAMIE
I’m sorry I --

AUDREY
What is it you’re hoping to find

JAMIE
Detective Lipton called me he told
me to meet him here

AUDREY
Bullshit

Audrey edges forward gun trained
JAMIE
Detective Lipton is in here
somewhere I swear it

AUDREY
There ain’t no one here but you

JAMIE
I heard him

AUDREY
Well then where is he

LIPTON’S VOICE (0S)
Right in front of you

They both WHIRL when they hear the voice

It did indeed come from right in front of thembut there is
no one there - just a wall

AUDREY
Who is that Get out of there

JAMIE
Wait

Jamie steps forward holding the lantern out in front of him
Audrey stops breathing cocking the shotgun

Jamie reaches the wall examining it with the lantern
He looks back at Audrey then holds ott his arm --

-- and instead of hitting the wall his arm extends THROUGH
it

Thats bécause it is not a’wall at all but a HIDDEN DOoR
disguised by the patterns of the wood

AUDREY
Good God

Jamie disappears through the hidden door Audrey takes a
flashlight out of her pocket and follows him through it

INT THE DOLL ROOM — CONTINUOUS
Foul air hits them as they step into an adjoining room
They step forward -- straight into a sheet of cobwebs

Jamie swats at it clearly not a fan of spiders They claw
the webbing away revealing a better view of the chamber

It is long and narrow with ratty DRAPES covering shelving
that lines the walls on either side of them

A single beam of moonlight leaks though a small window on the
wall facing them

JAMIE
Detective

Audrey swathes the tenebrous cavern with her flashlight
Neither of them dares breathe

Finally Jamie sizes up the TAUT CLOTH which covers up one
side of the dust-choked dungeon

He approaches it careful

Picks up one corner of it

Audrey‘s heart is in her throat

Jamie RIPS the curtain away

revealing a large GLASS-FRONTED CABINET Behind the

glass all perched on shelves in neat rows like obedient
children are DOZENS UPON DOZENS OF VENTRILOQUIST DUMMIES

All of them wearing the exact same tuxedo BILLY wears
Bé

The flashlight gives each wooden face a moment in the
spotlight All those sets of eyesall STARING EERILY at
Audrey and Jamie

Jamie finally turns to face the cloth on the opposite side of
the room There appears to be someone or something under it
Jamie looks back at Audrey who grips her shotgun Jamie
tears the sheet away

Audrey stifles a gasp

Instead of more wooden dolls Audrey’s flashlight finds a
hideously atrophied HUMAN BODY - slumped over its head bowed
forward

Like all the other dummies the body is dressed exactly like
Billy

Audrey steps in close to the body examining the hardened
leathery flesh of its face She bends down trying to get a
better view

AUDREY
This body has been preserved
like a hunting trophy

Wires are cdiled around the bodies chest neck and wrists
The wires run up to the ceiling strung over wooden beams
They dangle down in front of Jamie tied to blocks of wood

He grips one of the four wooden handles pulling down on the
wire

The bodies head SNAPS upwards Audrey recoils in SHOCK

The wire has acted like a pulley lifting the bodies head to
reveal a YOUNG BOY - his features drooping like melted wax
his mouth elongated into a permanent smile that belies his
dead unblinking eyes

It is the disbelieving RED-HEADED boy we met in Henry‘s
flashbackonce alive now just EMBALMED FLESH filled with”
sawdust

Jamie pulls down on another of the wires and the boys hand is
lifted

He is a HUMAN PUPPET

Jamie lets go of the wires repulsed -- realizing he has been
operating the boy like a marionette
The walls behind the boy are plastered with damp faded
newspaper articles Headlines scream out at them MISSING
CHILD SEARCH FOR CHILD GROWS DESPERATE RAVEN’S FAIR
MYSTERY
AUDREY

T think we just solved a sixty year

old mystery
They stare at the boy transfixed

-but there is something they don’t see

Behind them one of the dummies in the cabinet MOVES Its
eyes turn slightly Creaking

Jamie whirls around and snaps the lantern onto it

AUDREY
This boy--

JAMIE
Wait

Then

“The dummies whole head moves

It pivots to the right with a click as if staring off at
something

Another head followsthen anotherthen another Like a
SPREADING WAVE every one of the devilish dolls swivels its
head to the right all FOCUSING on something at the end of
the room

Terrified Jamie and Audrey follow the many sets of eyes to
what they are all looking at a FIGURE sagging in a rocking
chair in the corner

Another ventriloquist dummy
At first it does nothingthen its jaw moves ever so
slightly Emits two hoarse whispered words in the voice of
LIPTON
THE DUMMY
(in Lipton‘’s voice)
Found me

Jamie and Audrey stand before the ghoulish gallery

AUDREY
Mary Shaw

The doll’s eyes turn to Audrey Its voice becomes a dread-
filled rasp

THE DUMMY
Clever

Audrey looks back at the corpse of the young boy

AUDREY
You killed that boy

THE DUMMY
No I gave him a new voice

FLASHCUT TO
INT DOLL ROOM - NIGHT -- FLASHBACK

The red-headed boy is slumped on Mary Shaw’s lap - the dead
and mummified version of the boy we have just seen

Mary strokes his hair

MARY SHAW
Ddnt I treat you well Billy

Mary then provides the VOICE of the boy - as she would a
ventriloquist dummy

MARY SHAW
(in the voice of the boy)
Yes mother The best I could ever
hope for

FLASHCUT TO
INT DOLL ROOM - NIGHT -- PRESENT
Audrey and Jamie are horrified by what they are hearing
AUDREY
Why have you come back Why after
all these years
THE DUMMY
So hard to find the perfect child
(beat)
Sometimes you have to make one

Jamie’s chest heaves unable to believe what he is hearing
JAMIE
What happened to Lisa

The dummy seems to be revelling in Jamie’s pain Grinninc

THE DUMMY
I took her tongue

JAMIE
Why Why her Why would you take
her

THE DUMMY
I did it to bring you back

JAMIE
What do you want with me

THE DUMMY
Come closer and Ill tell you

Jamie takes a step toward the grotesque puppet Audrey
reaches out to grab him but he shakes free

THE DUMMY
Closer

He takes anbther step

THE DUMMY
I‘ll whisper it to you

Jamie leans down near enough to touch the dumny
Time stops
Then--

THE DUMMY
It‘s time to make another perfect
child

As the dummy whispers these words A LONG FLESHY TONGUE POURS
FROM THE ITS MOUTH licking Jamies face He REELS BACK as
the doll’s cackling rings out

SUDDENLY -—

A bone-white hand covered in dead flesh clasps the side of
the dummies head from behind followed by another hand on the
other side of the dummies head

Someone is crouching BEHIND the dummy The new figure begins
to rise

It is MARY SHAW

She holds ‘the dummy up in front of her hiding her face her
tongue writhing through the back of the its head and
projecting out of its mouth lolling and flicking at them
The tongue is made from SEVERAL OTHER TONGUES -—- ALL MELDED
TOGETHER TO FORM ONE SERPENTINE APPENDAGE THAT STRETCHES AT
LEAST A FOOT IN LENGTH

Jamie SCRAMBLES back as Mary advances

Audrey FIRES the shotgun hitting the dummy and BLOWING IT
BACKWARDS THROUGH THE WINDOW

Mary Shaw SCREAMS - and vaporizes into THIN AIR

One of the dummies in the cabinet turns its head to face
Jamie and Audrey

It begins to LAUGH filling the chamber with a NERVE-
SHATTERING chorus of sadistic pleasure

From WITHIN THE DUMMY a ghostly APPARITION begins OOZING out
of the eye-sockets forming Mary Shaws face

BOOM - Audrey fires another shot - SHATTERING the glass and
destroying the dummy before Mary‘’s spirit can fully form

Mary rips out another inhuman SCREAM
Audrey fumbles through her pocket for more shells

A third dummy turns its head and Mary ONCE AGAIN starts to
SLITHER out

Jamie watches this realization crashing down on him

JAMIE
Destroy all the dolls

He seizes the gas lantern and heaves it at the cabinet The
lantern smashes and the shelves IGNITE

Mary WAILS in pain
The whole cabinet is ablaze

Jamie yanks Audrey towards the doorway

Behind them the body of the YOUNG BOY begins to move His
head lifts turning towards them his arms reaching out as a
SHAPE begins to LEAK from within hin

Stumbling Audrey and Jamie retreat into --

INT MARYS LIVING AREA - ‘CONTINUOUS

-- Marys living quarters and then --

INT PASSAGEWAY GUIGNOL THEATER - CONTINUOUS

-- down the corridor that leads to her quarters stumbling
out onto --

INT BACKSTAGE GUIGNOL THEATER - CONTINUOUS
-- the catwalk It trembles under their feet

They walk backwards eyes LOCKED on the door to Mary’s living
area

Mary appears in the doorway as calm as a python - ADVANCING
towards them down the passageway She flicks her tongue at
them menacing

Jamie and Audrey back up as she glides out onto the catwalk

MARY SHAW
in Lipton’s voice)
I can make you scream

She STOMPS down on the metal grill beneath her feet and the
force is enough to DISLODGE the catwalk It pitches
downwards Jamie and Audrey PLUNGING off it --

Jamie SNATCHES a curtain rope with one arm as he falls

Audrey isn’t so lucky She SCREAMS as she flails in the air --
and that’s when it happens

Her tongue begins to separate from her throat MID-SCREAM It
LAUNCHES from her mouth in a geyser of blood Mary Shaw
collecting it from the air between them and SLURPING it down
like a large tasty slug

JAMIE
Audrey

Audreys body smashes to the stage below bones cracking

Jamie dangies high above the stage his force swinging the
rope wildly from side to side

fo im

He looks down seeing a halo of blood spreading around
Audreys body

He goes for broke -- letting go of the rope as he reaches the
curtain grabbing the -red velvet and sliding down landinc sO
hard on the stage that he CRASHES THROUGH IT --
INT PROP STORAGE ROOM BELOW STAGE - CONTINUOUS

- and lands in a body of water

He surfaces gagging and coughing whipping his head around
and being greeted by A CLOWN FACE

He is treading water in some kind of STORAGE ROOM for stage
props - long since FLOODED

He ducks under the water lunging forward and spear-swimming
through MANNEQUINS COSTUME RACKS GARISH MASKS and more -
memoirs of a glorious past now left to drown in a basement
He reaches a sluice gate which spills out into --

EXT LAKE - NIGHT

-- the lake

Jamie pitches headfirst into the murky moat

He resurfaces gasping and begins kicking for the shore

Halfway across he stops lost in the fog He whips a look
around Doesn’t know which way to swim Below him --

-- UNDER THE WATER --

- a dummy floats like a corpse in the current - the very one
Audrey had blown out of the window with the shotgun

A HAND begins to claw its way from within the dummies face
ON THE SURFACE

Jamie kicks forward - NOT SEEING the body of Mary Shaw
FORMING underneath him

Her head breaks the surface RISING like a leviathan

Her shoulders clear the water - until she stands on the
surface gliding gracefully across the water

Headed straight for Jamie

ve
bad

His heart skips a beat as he sees her He kicks and
splutters surging forward struggling to move

Mary is closer now arms OUTSTRETCHED

‘Desperate he takes one last dive --

-- and lands on hard ground

EXT FOREST - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

He claws himself out of the mud standing up and running
forwardbranches lashing his faceblood stinging his
eyes

He stumbles out onto the road seeing his car up ahead

He sprints to it flinging open the door and jumping in He
slots his key into the ignition

The engine screeches in protest

JAMIE
Come on come on

The car roars to life
He stomps on the gas and is gone
INT JAMIE’S CAR MOVING - NIGHT

Jamie checks his face in the mirror - sweat and blood trickle
down his forehead

Something has CHANGED about him - his eyes look wild Once he
was on the edge - now he’s over it

He accelerates the trees whipping past him on either side of
the lost highway taking him somewhere anywhere away from
here

EXT “COME ON INN’ MOTEL - NIGHT

A storm is brewing

Jamie‘s car screeches to a halt outside Lipton’s room

He leaps out charging up to Lipton’s door

He pushes on it It is already open

INT LIPTON’S ROOM ‘COME ON INN’ MOTEL - CONTINUOS
Jamie maneuvers inside the room careful

He treads forward

And then he sees it --

-- a river of blood tracks through the room leading from he
crawlspace door into the bathroom

Jamie prods the bathroom door open

Lipton is there TWISTED on the floor his face grossly
contorted His tongue MISSING

Jamie starts tossing the place ransacking drawers and
anything else in his path Then--

-- his eyes land on something and he stops
Sheets of paper on the ground Police records

A mug-shot of Boz glares up at Jamie his fingerprints laid
out beneath it

Jamie plucks the papers up

As he reads a cover letter from the fax Lipton received we
see the keywords hitting him like darts “fhe fingerprints
found on the axe you turned in match those of Michael ‘Boz’
Bosley

On a separate line ’There is a second set of unidentified
fingerprints’

Jamie looks up from the papers

JAMIE
Boz

He spots Lipton‘’s gun on the ground near the crawlspace
entrance and snatches it up

He scours around locating a spare clip of bullets He takes
it jamming it awkwardly into the gun

»and is on the move again

EXT ASHEN HOUSE - NIGHT
Home sweet home

Jamie peers through the gates which swing in the breeze the
oil-starved hinges moaning

He heaves them open stepping onto the grounds of the house
The fog curls up around his legs like tentacles

Thunder cracks in the distance lightning blinking and
illuminating the house

He moves toward the garden shed which is lit from within
He swallows and cocks the gun

INT GARDEN SHED ASHEN HOUSE - NIGHT

Jamie swings open the door

The shed is empty a lantern creaking as it swings in th
wind

Breathing hard Jamie explores the shed

On the wall there is a rack of tools held in place by
nails A hammer pliers a set of garden shearsand a space
where an AXE should be

BOZS VOICE Warm

Jamie WHEELS on the voice

It came from outside the shed

EXT ASHEN HOUSE - NIGHT

Jamie edges outside surveying the dark garden
Not a soul in sight

BOZ’S VOICE (0S)
Warmer

Jamie hones in on the voice - it is coming from directly
ahead amongst the trees

He takes a tentative step toward it knee-deep in fog

The shadow of a figure begins to take shape in front of him
Jamie stops moving and aims the gun his hand trembling

JAMIE
I can see you there Boz

No response
An agonizing beatthen Jamie steps forward again --

-- AS BOZ SITS BOLT UPRIGHT OUT OF THE FOG HIS TONGUE
MISSING

He gags spitting blood and gripping his throat He GRABS

‘Jamies foot eyes pleading

We hear the sound of disembodied laughter swirl around Jamie
receding into the distance like a WAKING DREAM

Jamie bends down trying to help Boz

JAMIE
No No

Boz sags in Jamie’s arms as he sucks in his last breaths
He is gone

Jamie fights tears -- more of anger than anything else
He looks up at the house

-clenching his teeth and fists

INT FRONT DOOR ASHEN HOUSE - NIGHT

The front door lumbers open arthritically

Jamie steps inside

The sole sound comes from a distant clock

Jamie edges forward holding the gun out before him
INT STAIRWELLUPSTAIRS CORRIDOR ASHEN HOUSE - NIGHT

He climbs the stairs every creaking floorboard a thunderclap
in the dead quiet

At the top of the stairs a mouth of darkness beckons him to
become its food the hallway

intermittent pools of light are cast by the wall-mounted
lamps receding down the hall

je

He creeps forward

Tick tick tick The grandfather ciock ahead of him goes
about its business

There is’ ie other sound

»then CRUNCH

Jamie looks down

He lifts his foot the slime of a dead cockroach stretching
eo the floor Several other cockroaches crawl up his

He swallows his disgust flicking the insects away

Another cockroach skitters from underneath a door then
another

They are coming from Jamie’s bedroom
INT JAMIES BEDROOM ASHEN HOUSE — CONTINUOUS
The door whines open Jamie fumbles inside

He surveys the room his eyes panning across the white sheets
which are draped over the furniture in the room

A cockroach appears from under one of the white sheets

Jamie moves towards it SEIZING the WHITE SHEET and ripping
it away --

-- revealing an old wooden diaper changing table A leather
bound book site on top of it

Jamie picks up the book flipping it open
A lock of hair is taped to the front page
On the next page an ultrasound photo Then a tiny footprint
Jamie reads the words written on the front
JAMIE
(reading from book)

In memory of Ella and Charles‘

Ashen‘s daughtertwelfth of

August 2005

He runs his fingers over the diaper changing table

JAMIE (CONTD)
She lost a baby

Jamie sets the book down and tears one of the other white
sheets ‘away --

-- to unveil a crib complete with hanging baby toys
dangling above it like circling vultures

He peers into the crib

AR huge pack of cockroaches scatter around the soiled sheets
in it crawling over each other

In the center of the swarm is a jar filled with a yellowing
liquid

Jamie shudders with revulsion as he sees what is in the jar -
If IS A FOETUS Curled into a ball and shriveled

THEN—-

A noise Its coming from outside the room

He snaps his head around

It is the sound ef someone sobbing

INT UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR ASHEN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

He steps out of the bedroom stalking down the hall

The whimpering sobs drift towards him from out of the
darkness up ahead

Jamie advances

A light spilling from underneath a door at the end of the
hall comes into focus

It is the door to the master bedroom

He approaches it the crying getting louder as he does
INT MASTER BEDROOM ASHEN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

And in the dark dark housethere was a dark dark room
The door creaks open

Jamie slips inside

He glances around the huge sparsely furnished room
iv)

-past a four-poster bed shielded by a sheer lace
curtainpast a FIREPLACE its flames giving off the only
lightto a tall free-standing closet

The sobbing interrupts him again

It is coming from within the closet

The closet doors open a fraction a thin blade of darkness
separating them

Jamie plays statues staring at the closet We can hear his
heart beat

He treads towards the closet

-Closer

closer

--standing in front of it He grips the gun tightly
Takes a deep breath --

-- and throws open the doors

The chime of coat-hangers greets him

A face grins up at him from the back of the closet
BILLY

The sobbing melts into laughter - a slow burning cackle

JAMIE FREEZES as he realizes the LAUGHTER is coming from
BEHIND him

That’s when a mirror mounted on the inside of the door shows
him a terrifying vision

In the reflection MARY SHAW IS STANDING RIGHT BEHIND HIM
GRINNING
He whips around to face her

She SNARLS at him her tongue worming across her chest like a
blood soaked eel

MARY SHAW
(in Lisa’s voice)
I can make you scream

ae

JAMIE
No You don’t scare me

Jamie snatches up BILLY the dummy
Mary HISSES at him
- JAMIE
I think you’re a bit too old to be
playing with dolls
Mary CHARGES at him arms outstretched -
-- as Jamie HURLS the dummy into the fireplace

The flames CONSUME the doll the paint on its face bubbling
and melting as it is scorched

Mary lets out a SHRIEK heard in hell her body writhing in
agony

-eand then she is gone Her scream fades

Jamie sags into the corner EXHAUSTED with fear
His breath subsides and he closes his eyes

He finally opens them looking around the room

There is no sign of Mary The only sound is the crackle of
burning wood

Jamie‘s eyes land on a figure in the corner
It is his father

Sitting upright in his wheelchair he faces Jamie with the
stolid expression of a coma patient hidden in shadows

Jamie gets up Slow Locked on his father

JAMIE
Dad

No answer is forthcoming Jamie steps closer to him

JAMIE (CONTD)
Dad

He steps closer again reaching his father

Jamie CLUTCHES Charles by the shoulder - JOSTLING him

pacban

JAMIE (CONTD)
Dad

And then it happens

Charles flops forward-in his wheelchair

Jamie STOPS DEAD Cannot comprehend what he is seeing
ALL OF THE MEAT HAS BEEN STRIPPED AWAY FROM CHARLES’ BACK
INSTEAD OF AN EXPOSED SPINE THE FLESH HAS BEEN EMBALMED
STITCHED TOGETHER AND STUFFEDLIKE A DOLL

united with his father

As Jamie stands and dismisses the pleasantries we ROTATE

A shadow FLATS across the wall behind him and he whips

bed beyond the lace curtain

We see the shadow fall into the figure which then sucks in a
huge breath sitting up

She climbs out of the bed walking towards Jamie
