JACKIE
Going down to the bar with you guys I’m
meeting my old stunt buddy Pepper

in there You’re starting to sound
like a Golden Retriever

RODNEY
Is that a new jacket Del

DEL
Cool right It’s got a tiger making
love to a lady on the back

RODNEY
That’s a lion eating a monkey

DEL
Not less cool

RODNEY
And how’d you pay for that I thought
we were broke after you spent all our
money bidding on that storage unit

Without even consulting me
CRAGG and BRADLEY ONLY FOOLS AND HORSES 1152012

DEL
Sorry about that bro I had to move
quickly Got a tip that it was filled
with Fabergé Eggs

RODNEY
But it wasn’t It was filled with tubs
of hair

DEL
You don’t know Rodney that could be
George Washingtons hair (OPENS TUBS
GAGS) Though that does not smell human

RODNEY
I think you’re cheatin’ me

DEL
My own brother That’s outrageous We
split everything down the middle 6040

RODNEY
Then why is it you’re able to afford a
porn director’s jacket but I didn’t
even have enough cash to take my date
out for dinner last night

DEL
That’s a lie I gave you those Sbarro
coupons

RODNEY
Which were fraudulent Security chased
us out of the mall and across a very
busy highway She got clipped by a

Prius I won’t be seeing her again
CRAGG and BRADLEY ONLY FOOLS AND HORSES 1152012

DEL
Maybe it’s for the best I got a look
at her and she had a face that a
traffic accident could only improve
RODNEY
Ive had it Del You never consult me
on anything you don’t listen to my
ideas and you treat me like a child
DEL
Well you are a child You’re only nineteen
RODNEY

I’m twenty-three

DEL
Good Lord When did that happen (THEN) Anyway
my point is you’re still learning our industry
RODNEY
Industry We buy crap and sell crap out of
the back of a crappy car We’re basically the
white “Sanford and Son”
DEL
First of all the ‘78 Pacer Wagon is a
classic And B we may not have a fancy store
front but this is a legitimate business (RE
RODNEY’S TYPING) What are you doing
RODNEY

or damaged items sold at a deep discount and
we’re gonna be there to clean up Sure we’re
sittin’ on tubs of hair right now But trust

you from making horrible dangerous
