by Bo Burnham
OVER BLACK

A GAY KID (VO)
Are you okay

INT MAGGIE’S ROOM NIGHT

MAGGIE HIGGINS (17 obese and beautiful) lies on top of her
bed in shorts and a hooded sweatshirt Her laptop open on her
chest Instead of the sounds of her empty room we hear a
quiet conversation happening somewhere loud and crowded

MAGGIE (VO)
I‘m fine Just something kind of
shitty happened last night

A GAY KID (VO)
Did the field hockey skanks prank
call you again I don’t understand
them I thought prank calling
stopped in the nineties What are
you gonna do next girls Throw my
pager in the toilet

MAGGIE (V0O)
No it wasn’t them Or it might of
been them I don’t know who it was

ON MAGGIE’S LAPTOP’S SCREEN -- Maggie opens her facebook
page Her profile picture is of her posing sillily with a boy
of similar age but much smaller size

A GAY KID (VO)
What happened

MAGGIE (VO)
Just someone sent me something

A GAY KID (VO)
What’d it say
(then)
You don’t have to tell me

MAGGIE (VO)
No no it’s fine I brought it up

ON THE SCREEN there’s one message in Maggie’s inbox She
clicks it

MAGGIE (VO)
It was like a letter Like a long
carefully written letter

(MORE)
MAGGIE (VO) (CONTD)
The first line was “Dear fat
chick why are you so fucking fat”

ON THE SCREEN - we see the first few lines of the message
DEAR FAT CHICK HOW DID YOU GET SO FUCKING FAT YOU MUST HAVE
SUCKED YOUR MOTHER’S TITTIES DRY

Maggie’s face loses color as she reads

MAGGIE (VO)
It started with like two paragraphs
of fat jokes

A GAY KID (VO)
Jesus Mags

MAGGIE
And then it kept going But it
stopped trying to be funny

ON THE SCREEN another section reads NO ONE WILL EVER FUCK
YOU FUCKING YOU WOULD BE LIKE FUCKING A

MAGGIE (VO)
It was like “I feel bad for you
that have to take showers with
yourself”

ON THE SCREEN it continues DO YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES WHEN YOU
GET DRESSED IF I WAS HALF YOUR SIZE I WOULD

Tears run down Maggies face Her face frozen her eyes
scanning the message furiously

MAGGIE (VO)
And what was fucked up about it--

A GAY KID (VO)
Maggie the whole thing is fucked
up Forget it It was probably just
some——

MAGGIE (VO)
What was fucked up was that it was
like a full-length letter

ON THE SCREEN the message ends YOU’RE FAT YOURE GROSS
KILL YOURSELF SINCERELY EVERYBODY

Maggie shuts her laptop and sobs into her hands
MAGGIE (VO)
It was like an essay Someone took
a good two hours out of their night
to write it No one’s ever spent
two hours making me anything

She walks over to a full-length mirror that has a picture of
a 10 year-old Maggie taped in the corner Maggie stares at
her reflection

A GAY KID (VO)
And you don’t know who sent it

Maggie starts taking off her clothes

MAGGIE (VO)
The profile was made that night No
picture no name Nothing

Maggie now naked raises her phone in front of her face and
takes a picture She looks at the photo for a few seconds
taking herself in

A GAY KID (VO)
You should’ve called me I would’ve
come over

MAGGIE (VO)
No it’s fine I fell asleep right
after I read it

Maggie stares at the picture on her phone Her battery dies
She sits on the side of her bed still naked her head
hanging

INT WESTFIELD HIGH SCHOOL -—- CAFETERIA DAY

Maggie sits at an otherwise empty lunch table with the gay
kid ALEX (17 tiny and effeminate) the same boy from her
profile picture They continue their conversation

ALEX

A SKATER GIRL sitting next to a JOCK at a crowded table The
Skater Girl puts her head on the Jock’s shoulder

Couple after couple Every different combination of boy and
girl Alex picks up his backpack and starts walking across
the cafeteria towards the exit

He passes NATHAN (17 lacrosse jersey athletic and cute)

ALEX

Nathan walks back to his friends Alex turns and exits the
cafeteria

EXT WESTFIELD HIGH - FIELD HOCKEY FIELD LATER

It’s Westfield High versus Andover High Hot young field
hockey players scramble in their short plaid skirts and knee
high socks at Mid-field The girls swarm and tussle around
the ball looking much more attractive than athletic

ON THE OTHER END OF THE FIELD Maggie plays goalie looking
much more athletic than attractive She’s decked out in large
clunky goalie gear -- helmet mouthguard glove leg pads
arm pads

IN THE STANDS not much of an audience for a field hockey
game A few stray parents and boyfriends

ON THE SIDELINES someone in a large BEAVER COSTUME waves a
flag that reads “WINSTON THE WESTFIELD BEAVER” The costume
hangs loose on someone very small inside of it The beaver
dances to a boombox beside him that blares cheesy 80’s dance
music His moves are very flashy and very fabulous

IN THE STANDS -- a LOUD BRO heckles the beaver
LOUD BRO
Beavers aren’t supposed to do gay
dances

The small crowd laughs The beaver stops the music and takes
off his head It’s Alex

ALEX

(to loud Bro)
Well beavers aren’t supposed to
walk upright or have the ability to
carry flags either

(to the crowd)
Would you people rather see a
normal boring beaver or a fun
dancing beaver

VARIOUS CROWD
Normal beaver
ALEX
Well you don’t have a choice

Alex puts the beaver head back on starts the music again and
dances harder

ON THE FIELD Suddenly one of the cuter blonder players
from Andover breaks away from the pack and starts charging at
Maggie with the ball Maggie digs her heels it slaps her
stick across her chest and squats into position As the
Andover player approaches she dips to one side then the
other and then slaps a shot at the goal Maggie DIVES and
makes an amazing glove save She drops the ball and hits it
down field to one of her teammates

ON THE SIDELINES -- Alex cheers in the beaver costume

ALEX (CONTD)
(muffled through the
beaver head)
Yay Maggie

The REF whistles the end of the game and the Westfield girls
cheer and form a celebratory huddle in the middle of the
field

Maggie hustles towards the circle of girls in her field
hockey equipment arriving just as the huddle breaks up and
the girls head to the benches leaving Maggie alone in the
middle of the field

ON THE SIDELINES the other Westfield girls greet their
parents and boyfriends

As Maggie watches girl after girl be hugged and congratulated
by each girl’s personal entourage Maggie’s entourage comes
skipping over in a baggy Beaver costume

ALEX (CONTD)
You are a fucking beast

Maggie laughs and lights up instantly Alex does a cartwheel
losing his beaver head in the process and transitions into a
giant bear hug with his best friend

ALEX (CONTD)
That bitch came at you thinking she
was gonna score and you were like
“Score More like go fuck yours-

VOICE Maggie
COACH (40s grey) approaches He’s cheery and a bit
overweight

COACH
Phenomenal stuff today Maggie
phenomenal

MAGGIE
Thanks coach

Alex coughs twice loudly looking for attention

COACH
And lovely dancing today Alex

ALEX
(feigning surprise)
Awww coach

COACH
Alright get some rest

MAGGIE

Coach leaves Alex puts his beaver arm around Maggie

ALEX
We killed it today

INT WESTFIELD HIGH — GIRL’S LOCKER ROOM LATER

The cute field hockey players wander around the locker room
wrapped in towels The showers are running and steam fills
most of the room

ACROSS THE BATHROOM Maggie comes out of one of the stalls
clutching a towel having changed into a purple one-piece
bathing suit She’s visibly self-conscious

She walks towards the group shower As she sets her towel
down on a wooden bench BROOKE (18 pretty) steps out of the
shower She’s wet and hot

BROOKE

parachute anywhere

MAGGIE
Good one
BROOKE

Maggie stands under the shower faucet and closes her eyes

INT MAGGIE’S ROOM NIGHT

Maggie lies on her bed in the dark Her laptop on her chest
Shes reading the “DEAR FAT CHICK MESSAGE” -- She reads for a
few moments before the familiar sound of a new message in her
inbox stops her She clicks it it’s from DEREK TAMLIN his
profile picture is a picture of some mountains It reads

) - MAGGIE

Maggie presses send and closes her laptop unable to wipe the
smile off her face She reaches over to her night-stand and
grabs her phone She sets an alarm for 700 AM and then
clicks on her photo-album and starts scrolling through

A picture of her and Alex Another picture of her and Alex A
picture of her painted nails A picture of some clouds she
thought were pretty And she stops at the naked picture she
took the night before

She stares at it one last time and deletes it

hallway We follow Maggie through a gauntlet of kids cheering
and laughing as she passes them In the distance we see Alex
appear from a doorway and run after her

We continue following Maggie down a narrow corridor The
sounds of kids fading behind her Alex yells after her
catching up Maggie bursts through a set of double doors and
into--

INT WESTFIELD HIGH SCHOOL MUSIC DEPARTMENT CONTINUOUS

INT BACK CORRIDOR CONTINOUS

A sign on the wall points to the “GIRLS LOCKERROOM” Maggie
follows the long corridor all the way down the locker room

INT GIRLS LOCKERROOM CONTINUOUS

Maggie enters the locker room only to stop when she hears the
familiar voices of the field hockey team

BROOKE (0S)

The group of girls laugh

ANOTHER GIRL (0S)
What’s scary is that she probably
took like twenty and that was the

BROOKE

swimsuits in the shower It’s like
“weve already seen everything
Marge No need to--”

The sounds of the girls fade as we leave the locker room with
Maggie

INT BACK CORRIDOR CONTINOUS

The door shuts behind her Maggie walks quickly back down the
corridor Shaking her head Crying Angry Really fucking
angry But just as she grabs the door to the weightroom
something further down the corridor catches her eye

Folded neatly on top of a cheap folding table is the BEAVER
MASCOT UNIFORM Maggie stares at it The beaver head stares
back An evil smile frozen on its face

INT GIRLS LOCKERROOM MOMENTS LATER

The lockerroom door is KICKED OPEN and a massive furious
beaver comes bounding in The Beaver looks much different
than it did on a tiny gay kid The Beaver is now a massive
hulking monster The Beaver comes around the corner to find
the field hockey girls sitting around gossiping

LINDSAY
What the f--

But before Lindsay can finish The Beaver grabs her by the
pony tail and SLAMS her face into a locker The rest of the
girls scream and scatter The Beaver catches A BLONDE GIRL by
the ankle and drags her across the floor The Beaver flips
her over and the blonde girl screams clutching her phone in
her hands The Beaver grabs the phone out of her hands

BLONDE GIRL
Not my phone PLEASE

The Beaver slams the phone on the ground smashing it into a
million pieces
peee

The Beaver continues it’s rampage Beating the hell out of
the girls -- throwing them into lockers punches kicks
headbutts It’s mayhem Girls scream The Beaver pulverizes
The same evil grin frozen on its face

Then the Beaver notices Brooke scamper into the group
shower The Beaver makes a bee line for it rounding the
corner to find Brooke cowering in the back corner of the
shower

The Beaver enters the shower and walks right up to Brooke
towering over her

BROOKE
What do you want Do you want
money Do you want to see my tits
Who the fuck are you

The Beaver turns the six shower heads on one by one

BROOKE (CONT’D)
What the fuck are you doing

Soaking wet the Beaver leaves the group shower as it begins
to fill up with steam Brooke soaking wet as well sighs and
then screams as the Beaver comes back holding a bright pink
BACKPACK

BROOKE (CONTD)
No Please all my school stuff is
in there You can’t Please

The Beaver walks into the shower and unzips the backpack The
steam is heavy now making it difficult to see

BROOKE (CONT’D)
PLEASE

The Beaver takes out a Macbook Pro and holds it under a
running shower head destroying it

BROOKE (CONT’D)
Youre fucking sick mister

The Beaver throws the rest of the backpack to the ground and
charges towards Brooke

BROOKE (CONTD)
(bloody murder)

We move away from the shower now billowing steam into the
rest of the room

The steam is too thick for us to see what the Beaver is doing
to Brooke but the screams we hear give us a hint

INT MAGGIE’S CAR LATER

Maggie soaking wet speeds down a suburban road with the
windows down She’s still wearing the beaver uniform but the
head is off She squints hard as the sun blares through her
window She puts the sun visor down a shadow bisects her
face and her eyes relax

down on his desk at the head of the class

MR ATCHISON

KYLIE (17 preppy) raises her hand

MR ATCHISON (CONT’D)

Maggie and Alex finally arrive at their empty table and sit
down across from one another

MAGGIE

Maggie ponders this DEREK TAMLIN the boy that messaged
Maggie the previous night walks by carrying a lunch tray
with two sloppy joes on it

He has long straight hair that covers his eyes and wears a

BOOOOOOP The sound of the school’s PA system An older man
speaks

PA VOICE (0S)

PRINCIPAL RICHARDS (50s) walks on to stage The crowd quiets

PRINCIPAL RICHARDS
Good morning students

STUDENTS
Morning HeyHelloBoo (Fart
noise)

PRINCIPAL RICHARDS
For those of you who are unaware of
yesterday’s events--

RANDOM STUDENT
THE BEAV

PRINCIPAL RICHARDS
-Yesterday someone dressed up as
Winston the Westfield Beaver and
assaulted a number of your fellow
classmates

IN THE CROWD Alex nudges Maggie and smiles Maggie mouths
“STOR «”

PRINCIPAL RICHARDS (CONTD)

We the administrators of the
school have contacted the local
police department and are working
with them to find the person
responsible for this

(a pause then)
Now this crime may have been
committed by some lunatic who
wandered off the street and put on
a beaver costume If that’s the
case the police will find him or
her

RANDOM BOY (0S)
Him

RANDOM GIRL (0S)
Sexist

RANDOM BOY
You’re joking right

PRINCIPAL
BUT If the culprit walks these
halls if the culprit is currently
sitting in this room then I will
find him or her I will expel him
or her immediately and I will turn
him or her over to the police

IN THE CROWD Maggie has turned white Alex puts a hand on
her knee

ALEX
(whispering)
You’re fine

ON STAGE

PRINCIPAL
HOWEVER If The Beaver is in this
room as I suspect and chooses to
come forward right now in front of
the very classmates that he or she
assaulted his or her punishment
will be greatly reduced

IN THE CROWD the students look around No one’s budging
Maggie grips her chair and looks at Alex

ALEX
Maggiedon’t

MAGGIE
I have to

But just as Maggie moves Alex stands up

ALEX
IM THE BEAVER

Everyone looks at Alex Principal Richards spots him and lets
out a single chuckle

PRINCIPAL RICHARDS
Really though Whoever did this
has til the end of the day to come
forward Go to class Be safe
everyone

Alex sits back down

ALEX
That felt homophobic

Maggie hangs her head Alex looks purposefully into the
distance

ALEX (CONTD)
We’re gonna turn this school upside
fucking down

MAGGIE

EXT FIELD HOCKEY FIELD LATER

The Westfield girls scramble with another team Brooke

Atta girl Maggie

Coach looks back into the stands checking in on A PREPPY
WOMAN (40s) who takes notes impressed As 80’s music begins
to BLARE the scout looks up confused

Alex dances near his boom box in his normal clothes Alexs
usual heckler pipes up

LOUD BRO
If you don’t have the costume just
sit the fuck down

Alex turns off the music

ALEX
The beaver has been stolen as you
all know But it’s a non-issue
because Winston the Westfield
Beaver is a state of mind not a
costume

LOUD BRO
You’re not our mascot if you’re not
in a beaver costume

ALEX
Well can’t you just pretend that
Im in a giant beaver
(realizing what he said)
Don’t answer that--

Alex puts the music back on and dances

EXT FIELD HOCKEY FIELD A BIT LATER

The game ends The Westfield girls form a celebratory huddle
at mid-field Maggie trudges straight to the sidelines from
her goal No longer trying to be included in a group that
doesn’t want her in the first place As she reaches the
bench she hears Brooke talking to ANOTHER PLAYER BROOKE
They said The Beaver could get some
legit time if I press charges

Maggie pretends not to listen

ANOTHER PLAYER

BROOKE

The huddle at midfield breaks and the girls run to the
sidelines Coach holds court

COACH

Maggie listens from the back of the huddle

Maggie storms into the house Alex doesn’t chase after her

INT KYLE’S HOUSE — FOYER NIGHT

Maggie steps inside It’s too much at once A hundred kids
flirting and gossiping with each other She turns to leave
Stops herself She scans the room People being drunk and
rowdy and annoying No one is looking at her It’s
overwhelming but fine We follow Maggie as she walks through

Maggie passes them into--

INT KITCHEN CONTINUOUS

A KEG sits in a sink full of ice Kids mingle around the
counter like awkward pubescent bar patrons Maggie watches a
COUPLE kiss They go at it for a few seconds and then walk
through a SWINGING DOOR

As the door swings back and forth Maggie can catch glimpses
of Derek in the corner of the adjacent room He’s alone
petting a cat that’s climbed onto a bookshelf Maggie smiles

INT FOYER NIGHT

Alex enters through the door A CRYING GIRL followed by
a TALL KID They argue in the doorway Alex watches

TALL KID

They exit the house Their argument fades as they walks away

CRYING GIRL
You can be a real asshole
sometimes

TALL KID
You can be a really paranoid bitch
all the time

Alex looks around the room No Maggie He turns left into the
a large room with a beer pong table

INT LIVING ROOM CONTINOUS

Suddenly a PREPPY KID completely unaware of whats been
happening comes in from the other room

addresses the terrified party

withwhatever ATTENTION MEMBERS
OF WESTFIELD HIGH SCHOOL

INT VARIOUS ROOMS

We check in on various kids in various hiding spots
listening to the beaver The high voice carries throughout
the house It’s creepy as shit

THE BEAVER
For years a handful of kid have
ruled your school They have had
the best four years of their lives
at the expense of others They have
done it without guilt and without
consequence But that time is over
now Justice will come to Westfield
High Those who hurt others will be
hurt themselves The Beaver shows
no mercy The Beaver accepts no
apologies Fear the Beaver That is
all

VOICE (0S)
And I’m GOLD BOY

A tiny person appears in the doorway He’s wearing a bright
metallic gold unitard and a gold cape He twirls a golden
cane On his head a motorcycle helmet spray-painted gold
His voice-changer is quite deep and would be intimidating if
it werent changing a very effeminate voice It sounds like
Darth Vader the drag queen He fabulously makes his way up
the stairs and takes his place beside The Beaver

GOLD BOY

quiet

MAGGIE (CONTD)

Alex looks at her and then puts on Gold Boy’s golden helmet
His voice drops four octaves

GOLD BOY
Whatever the fuck we want

Gold Boy hits a button on the radio and some upbeat 80s dance
music starts blasting Maggie smiles and puts on her beaver
head The Beaver and Gold Boy put down the windows and rock
out as they speed down an empty street

FACEBOOK PAGES — VARIOUS

With the 80s music still blasting we fly past facebook
pages

One kid writes “THE BEAVER STRIKES AGAIN” We follow the
comments down one girl writes “this shit is nuts” Another
girl “This isn’t funny kyle got a blackeye” The comment
under “Wut a pussy I could take a fucking beaver anyday of
the weak”

Someone posts a GRAINY CELL PHONE VIDEO of The Beaver
wreaking havoc at the party Fifty likes under the video A
cell phone photo of Gold Boy captioned “Some flat-chested
girl in tights is the beaver’s sidekick”

We move to the actual facebook page of THE BEAVER AND GOLD

BOY The profile picture is just LARGE GOLD TEXT ON A BROWN
BACKGROUND THAT READS “THE BEAVER AND GOLD BOY” We scroll
down to see that the page has 300 friends at WESTFIELD HIGH

Hundreds of posts on the wall We read some “YOU GUYS ARE

Maggie opens her front door Derek is decked out in his heavy
metal gear -- black eyeliner black clothes chains

DEREK

Thanks You too

They share a smile

INT BARNES AND NOBLE NIGHT

Maggie sits in a brightly lit and scarcely populated
bookstore among an audience of a MIDDLE AGED MOTHER (40s) and
a few YOUNG BROTHERS AND SISTERS (10-14)

A small stage is set up right between the “RELIGIOUS
DETECTIVES” section and the “PARANORMAL ROMANCE” section

On the stage is Derek’s band CHANCE (18 acne) on lead
guitar KSANDER (15 tiny) drums LUKE (17 too tall) the
lead singer and Derek on bass A homemade sign above them
reads “THE CLOTS” in bloody letters

LUKE
Thank you for coming We are The
Clots

The Clots bust into their first song It’s heavy loud
nonsense Luke SCREAMS low unintelligble lyrics We catch a
few “bloods” and “satans” but his singing mostly sounds like
cookie monster having an orgasm

Maggie watches smiling proud Her eyes never leave Derek
Derek’s eyes never leave the floor His hair covering his
face as he rocks

He lifts his head just long enough to check in on Maggie As
his eyes meet hers he puts his head back down But not
before we see his cheeks start to go red and his mouth curl
into a smile

EXT BARNES AND NOBLE NIGHT

Maggie Derek and the band hang out in the parking lot
Everyone is aggressively awkward

LUKE
“Death Labyrinth” sounded pretty
good tonight

KSANDER

tempo chance

the parking lot and then turns

MAGGIE
You drove me

DEREK

Derek walks towards her

INT ALEX’S ROOM NIGHT
Maggie busts through the door

ALEX
What took you so long

MAGGIE
Derek had to drive me home and then
I had to drive here

ALEX
Why didnt he just drop you off
here

MAGGIE

Cause I didn’t want him thinking
that I cut our date short so I
could hang out with my gay best
friend

ALEX
That’s fair

Maggie sits down

MAGGIE
How was your thing with Nathan

ALEX
I don’t want to talk about it

MAGGIE

ALEX

Maggie is annoyed but reluctantly continues

MAGGIE
»but I was wondering if you took

Maggie’s slowly transforms into Cody’s voice as Alex’s
bedroom slowly transforms into--

EXT FOOTBALL FIELD FLASHBACK

Cody shoots arrows with the THREE OTHER MEMBERS of the
Archery team

CODY (V0)

CODY (VO)
So two weeks ago our coach rented
a cabin for us for the weekend with

spend time with kids my age

INT CABIN SHOWER FLASHBACK
Cody washes his long curly hair

CODY (VO)

EXT SCHOOL PARKING LOT NIGHT
Maggie and Alex stand in an empty parking lot putting on
their costumes by Alex’s trunk

MAGGIE
He stood you up That sucks

ALEX
Like I saw him pull up And then he
just leaves

Alex puts on his helmet and Maggie puts on her beaver head
Their voices transform They shut the trunk and walk away
from the car

GOLD BOY
I mean he’s closeted He’s gonna be

completely unreliable

THE BEAVER
Yeah like so he has all the power
and you just have to wait for him
to be ready

GOLD BOY
Exactly This is why being gay and
dating is impossible in high
school

They walk around the outside of the school

THE BEAVER
Being fat and dating isn’t the
easiest thing either

GOLD BOY
Yeah but I’m much more gay than
you are fat

THE BEAVER
No way I’m way fatter than you are
gay

GOLD BOY

No cause you’re not that fat And
even if you were you might not be
fat in five years I’m super gay

It’s coming from behind a LARGE BARN tucked against the woods
behind the school Gold Boy and The Beaver give each other a
nod and run towards the barn

EXT BARN NIGHT

fire their ARROWS Two miss but one hits Gold Boy DIRECTLY IN
THE HEAD It doesn’t go in deep but it sticks

GOLD BOY
I’ve been shot in the head with an
arrow I have been shot in my
fucking head with a fucking arrow

The Beaver grabs Gold boy and ducks behind a tree in the
dark The boys reload

RICH
Come get us you fucking weirdos

Gold Boy and the Beaver whisper behind the tree

GOLD BOY
Why is this happening

THE BEAVER
Because they’re on the fucking
archery team

GOLD BOY
Right Yeah we shouldve seen this
coming

THE BEAVER

Are you okay
Alex tries to pull the arrow out It doesn’t move

GOLD BOY
I’m fine What’s our plan

THE BEAVER
Our plan is to get the fuck out of
here before we are killed with

arrows
GOLD BOY
I’ll distract them You do the
rest
THE BEAVER
What No

But Gold Boy is already running back to the light He arrives
and does a series of cartwheels Rich and Michael shoot and
miss Andrew doesn’t fire his arrow

ANDREW
This is really weird right

WHAM Andrew is leveled by the Beaver MICHAEL scrambles to
reload but is PUNCHED IN THE STOMACH by the Beaver and falls
to the ground Michael drops his bow surrendering

MICHAEL

WHACK Michael is knocked out by a flying punch from Gold

single hanging light bulb Rich Michael and Andrew sit on
metal folding chairs with their arms bound to their sides and
their bodies bound to the chairs with colorful jump ropes

three bows slung over its shoulder

GOLD BOY

GOLD BOY

calmly slowly

barbells I bet you chew sunflower
seeds I bet you think that’s cool
It’s not cool Rich Sunflower
seeds are stupid

THE BEAVER
Okay Gold Boy let’s get to the
point

GOLD BOY

The Beaver and I whoop the asses of
those who take pleasure in the
misfortune of others And since we
whooped your asses that must mean
that you three do just that Is
this accurate

ANDREW
Look whatever this is about we
can fix it

GOLD BOY
You jizzed in Cody Druschel’s
shampoo

Rich the least scared bursts out laughing Andrew and
Michael can’t help but join in Gold Boy grabs Michael by the
shirt

GOLD BOY (CONTD)
You think this is funny
motherfucker

Michael stops laughing Rich doesn’t

MICHAEL
No

GOLD BOY
Then why’d you do it to him
RICH
Cause Cody’s a little faggot

Gold Boy goes silent He slowly turns to Rich

GOLD BOY
What did you say

RICH
I said Cody’s a little faggot And
that’s why we came in his shampoo
Because he’s a little faggot

THE BEAVER
Rich etch nieks »«

GOLD BOY

faggot from time to time

RICH

Faggot
GOLD BOY

Ding ding ding Very good
Gold Boy walks over to a small black bag in the corner

GOLD BOY (CONT’D)
So I don’t like being called faggot
very much And I’m guessing Cody
Druschel doesn’t like being called
faggot that much either

Gold Boy grabs the bag and walks back to Rich

RICH
(terrified)
What are you doing

GOLD BOY
And I’m certain that Cody faggot
or not hated having the DNA of
such an ignorant fuck ejaculated
into his shampoo bottle

Gold Boy pulls a pair of HAIR CLIPPERS out of the bag Rich
with his beautiful douchey haircut screams

RICH
NO Just beat me up Please
PLEASE
GOLD BOY

GOLD BOY (CONTD)

Beautiful locks of well-shampooed hair fall to the barn

floor The buzzing of the hair clippers can’t drown out the
screams

END OF MONTAGE

A GENTLE MANS VOICE (PRE-LAP)
There are four different types of
bullying

INT AUDITORIUM DAY

The auditorium is packed with kids On stage MR SENATE (50
gentle moustache) holds court A PowerPoint presentation on
bullying is playing behind him The current slide reads “5
TYPES OF BULLYING”

MR SENATE
There is physical bullying

Mr Senate presses a clicker in his hand and the next slide
pops up It reads “PHYSICAL BULLYING” and has a cheesy
cartoon of someone being beat up The whole presentation
wreaks of the 1980s

MR SENATE (CONT’D)
Physical bullying can be punching
or kicking or shoving Can anyone
give me an example of physical

bullying
(he scans the crowd)
Yes you

KID IN THE CROWD
Forcing someone to have sex with
you

MR SENATE
Okay well that’s rape which isn’t
really bullying per se but I think
you get the idea There’s also
verbal bullying

Next slide reads “VERBAL BULLYING” and a picture of a mouth

New slide

New slide

MR SENATE (CONTD)
Anyone want to give an example of
verbal bullying

RANDOM KID (0S)
You’re bald and ugly

ANOTHER KID (0OS)
You have a gay moustache

MR SENATE
Okay good Thank you--

DIFFERENT KID (VO)
I bet your moustache tickles your
boyfriend’s balls

MR SENATE
The third type of bullying is
social bullying

“SOCIAL BULLYING” cartoon of cliches of kids

MR SENATE (CONTD)
This form of bullying can manifest
itself in excluding one of your
peers from a dodgeball game or
perhaps ignoring them at an ice
cream social or sock hop And
finally there is Cyber Bullying

“CYBER BULLYING” picture of an original Macintosh

MR SENATE (CONT’D)

Now Cyber Bullying is the newest
form of bullying And it’s turned
out to be the most dangerous as
well Does anyone know why it’s so
dangerous

(scans the room)
Yes you in the red shirt

GIRL IN RED SHIRT
Because it’s cyber

MR SENATE
NoIt’s most dangerous because
it’s often anonymous And when
people can remain anonymous they
tend to do things that they
wouldn’t be able to do in real
life

In the back row Maggie sits with Alex listening carefully

MR SENATE (0S) (CONT’D)
There’s a lack of accountability
and a lack of consequence in this
new form of bullying But if we can
work together to communicate better
with each other maybe we can put a
stop to it

Maggie looks down

INT HALLWAY LATER

Maggie opens her locker She grabs a thick textbook She’s
just about to shut the locker when her eyes spot something
else A neatly folded piece of lined paper with “MAGGIE”
written on the outside Maggie smiles She grabs the note and
opens it It reads simply “I’ve seen your tits”

VOICE (0S)

someone in the bleachers

In the bleachers Derek sits by himself and waves back On
the ground below Alex does the robot next to his boombox He
gives Maggie a robot wave She laughs and robot waves back

underwear Alex walks over to the adjacent wall and grabs his
mascot BOOMBOX off a shelf

He places it on the floor and hits play It begins to blast
George Harrisons “I GOT MY MIND SET ON YOU” And Alex
finally lets his joy loose in the form of the most gloriously
flamboyant dance of all time

He’s free He’s happy He’s dancing like his father hoped he
never would

FADE TO BLACK
PRINCIPAL RICHARDS (OVER BLACK)

You thought your life was ruined
It wasn’t
INT PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE DAYS LATER

Principal Richards talks to Maggie Alex sits in the chair
beside her Officer Kay stands in the back

PRINCIPAL RICHARDS
When your picture was circulated I
felt terrible for you Maggie I
did I knew that you were going to
be in for what could be the worst
year of your life And you knew
that But what you didn’t know is
that that year would pass And that
the next one would come and be
different And then another year
would pass And then next one would
come and be different still In ten
years of working with high
schoolers that misunderstanding
has done the most damage It’s
hopelessness Hopelessness and
short-sightedness Your life wasn’t
ruined when that picture spread It
wasn’t But now it may be You
thought you had nothing to lose
rightYou did You had a
scholarship that’s gone You had a
clean record that’s goneBeing
the victim of bullying or ridicule
sucks and is unfortunate but
retaliating in the way you did is
cowardly And shameful You two
were never heroes You hurt your
classmates You scared them You
solved nothing Do you understand
that

MAGGIE ALEX

Yes We‘re sorry Yes

They are

ALEX
Yes weve very sorry

PRINCIPAL RICHARDS
Now Officer Kay and I have been
talking a lot this week trying to
figure out how to deal with this
It’s a bit of a mess because the
hundreds of requests in your
facebook message logs incriminates
four-fifths of the student body

(MORE)

PRINCIPAL RICHARDS (CONTD)
So I’m guessing many charges will
be dropped because almost every
incident’s victim was another
incident’s conspirator Jesus
Christ Anyway my guess is you two
will spend your summer doing
community service You may spend a
week or two in juvenile detention
I don’t know That’s not my
decision

ALEX
Okay

PRINCIPAL RICHARDS
Now for my decision You are
expelled for the rest of the year
All grades you have received in
these first few months of your
senior year will be forfeited You
will return to school next
September if you wish to graduate
the following spring

Maggie and Alex are stunned

MAGGIE
We have to do another year of high
school

PRINCIPAL RICHARDS
Correct
