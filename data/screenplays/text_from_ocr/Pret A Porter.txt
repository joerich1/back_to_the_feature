OLIVIER
(Heartily)

So business is slow for us these
days eh Its hard to be an agent
when comminism is dead I hadnt
heard from you in so iong I was
beginning to wonder if the network
had been dismantied

SERGEI
Well there wasnt much that we
needed from you once the wail came

OLIVIER suddenly cant talk and starts choking on his food
SERGEI tries to hit him on his back but OLIVIER turns blue and
stops moving SERGEI examines him looking panicky When he
realizes that OLIVIER is dead a calm comes over him He rifles
OLIVIERs pockets for a wallet takes the money wipes the
wallet for fingerprints and checks the rest of OLIVIERs
pockets He finds a number of invitations to fashion shows and
stuffs them into his pocket SERGEI then leaps out of the limo
ripping his jacket as he leaves He runs out into the traffic

earth did a polite person ever
become a designer

to be allowed every courtesy a
wife receives in these situations

serious lecturing

tone)
She may have seen him more than
Claude did but Claude is the one

as frivolous as clothes these

days More important things to
think about arent there Or maybe
clothes are exactly what they

need A diversion from life and
death questions

SERGEI
Yes thats exactly the thinking
And what do you do

SLIM
Oh I used to do quite a lot but
now I dont have to anymore Now
I dine out and tell people what
clothes they should wear I used
to do it by writing for magazines
Now I do it in person While Im
eating Its much more civilized
You can actually see the people
youre talking to

SERGEI
And that is a living

SLIM
Yes I get paid to do it The
designers I work for think its
wonderful when I advise potential
Clients that they will never gain
societys respect unless they
start wearing that particular
designers clothes

So what do you think I should
wear Perhaps something by Dior

afterwards Do you evernot look
into the toilet before you flush

DESIGNER
Never Stool watchers are such
unhappy people

NOBLE

(Ignoring the comment)
Its not so much a gruesome
absorption with bodily waste Its
just an acknowledgement that we
know so little about whats going
on inside There in the Kleenex
is some small clue to the
mysteries within a hint about
the inner condition We all try
to know ourselves yet the thing
that is most us the organs and
entrails that make us work

‘ a complete enigma I mean
I know what kind of suit looks
good on me and you probably know
what kind of haircut is most
flattering on you but how pany
men could walk into a room ful
of livers and pick out his
Assuming that you couldwalk
without your liver

came to change the
subject)
Perhaps you can tell me who some
of these people are

REGINA

Thats the designer Arthur Rader
Theres Marcel Abboud And

Yes its worse than when I was
growing up I had to smoke ina
closet when I was twelve And now
I have to smoke in a closet again
Its not so bad in Europe but
Im so used to being shunned I
just automatically leave a room
when I want a cigarette

LUDI
Kind of makes you wish you were
an alcoholic

REGINA
Yes they dont mind if you vomit
at the dinner table Who was it
that said something about it being
all right as long as the fish
comes up with the white wine

up youre a boor

LuDI
Speaking of wine can I get you
something to drink

REGINA

Thank you no Its one vice
thats never appealed to me They
say that smokers are generally
more intelligent than non-smokers
I cant imagine how thats
possible since it clearly takes
an inherent cretinism togtarm
smoking Maybe its the nicotine

s what little brain power
youve got

LUDI
I personally feel that Im getting
smarter every day

REGINA
Punny I was thinking that you
looked smarter just since I met
you

decolletage gloves handbags Closeups of the makeup these
women wear the attempts to look young and beautiful Plenty
of embarrassing examples The show should seem almost less
exciting than all this vanity on display We see CLAUDE
carrying her dog (the dog is wearing a black turtleneck
sweater) CLAUDE is dressed in some spectacular 30-year-old
designer creation In the audience people point to her and
speculate on who made her clothes

ABBOUDs clothing is conservative sedate elegant Most of his
MODELS are female impersonators We see ABBOUD backstage
watching the audience reaction as each set of MODELS goes
onstage Backstage the MODELS are rushing around half-dressed
flinging off one outfit and buttoning up the next Some of

BINKY

What do you mean

ABBOUD
Standards Any creep who can
scrape together a few thousand
and draw a stick figure with a
skirt calis himself a designer
Which is why people look so
terrible Have you looked around
on the street lately I dont know
where to turm my eyes Every one
I see is an affront to my sense
of esthetics

BINKY
Oh it cant be that bad In fact
forget the clothes you have to
a t that people are taking
better care of themselves Older
women seem to remain attractive
longer

95 95

BINKY (Contd)
(That she considers
herself an example of
this phenomenon is
unmistakable)

ABBOUD
(Smiling)
Older women have always been
attractive in France Youre
talking about the change in
American attitudes and this comes
purely out of economic influences

BINKY
What do you mean

ABBOUD
The baby boomers are getting old
Advertisers have to flatter them
Its simple

BINKY
(Changing the subject)
Well you certainly cant complain
about business Your show seemed
to be a success

ABBOUD

No business is good Well know
in the next few days how
successful this show was But Im
not suffering I do well because
I have no competition

BINKY se
What do you mean Last night the
party was filled with designers

ABBOUD
Who among them was competition
for me None of them do what I do

BINKY
Do you mean youre the only one
making elegant timeless clothes
What about Rader Givenchy
Valentino

ABBOUD
Youre talking about Fashion Im
talking about Style

O™ gs 95

BINKY
I dont understand

ABBOUD
Anyone can design a suit to look
like one of my suits But who is
the one who thought of them
Fashion is sticking with the
trend Style is inventing it

imagine Rader nude in the bathtub

According to our sources the
prices vary

RADER
what do they get for my show

FORGET
About 1000 francs each

RADER
And for Abboud

RADER
What the fuck does that mean My
dresses are just as expensive as
his I fucking well pay my MODELS
as mich as he does The fabrics
just as expensive as Abbouds
And he has the fucking nerve to
charge twice as much

FORGET
t dont think M Abboud is
consulted in this matter

RADER
I wouldnt bet on that Hes
probably sunning the scam

FORGET
M Rader do you have any idea
why M De La Fontaine would
have been carrying around somany
of your tickets

RADER
What do you think Im in on
scalping my own tickets You think
Id charge less for my show than
for Abbouds

TANTPIS interrupts impatiently In French pointing to the
photos theyve brought along he tells FORGET to ask if RADER
knows the man in the picture

FORGET

BINKY
You always strive for design
purity You only use natural
fabrics Ive heard you have an
abhorrence of synthetics

RADER
Cant stand the feel of them Even
those new ones supposed to feel
like silk There is one exception
though The one fabric I never
use is linen I dont know about
the rest of the world but I
perspire Judging by the way the
other guys use linen in their
spring collections I must be the
only person left with functioning
sweat glands Did they come up
with some anti-perspirant I dont
know about

BINKY
Whats wrong with linen

RADER
For one thing its hot For
another it wrinkles Who wants
to look like a root vegetable
bagged for market Youve got to
be a real slave to fashion to wear

it

RADER

RADER
Fashion is about speaking before
you open your mouth Wearing your
story Everybody wants to hear
stories

BINKY
And fabric is a story

RADER
Everything is a story When I was
a kid I saw stories everywhere
In the grille work of cars -
Cadillacs were happy Oldsmobiles
were bilious Buicks were tense
Same thing with clothes Theres
a story in a jacket Slash pockets

SISSY and LUDI are having tea with NATHALIE Theres tension
between SISSY and LUDI

SIssy
Your style hasnt changed much
over the years In this climate
what you do seems almost
conservative Not flamboyant like
Mugler or Gaultier

NATHALIE
Oh well theyre men

SISSY
What do you mean
(LUDI who is snapping
photos during the
interview stops at
the mention of men)

NATHALIE
Men like to excite women with big
showy nonsense eccentric clothes
Women go wild and think this is
the avant garde Especially those
who are a little older and want
to prove that they are still
young So they put on these
costumes and make themselves look
silly

SISSY
What does that have to do with
men

Between shows
is a teeming throng of reporters

NATHALIE
Look at what men design for women
and then look at what they design
for men When was the last time
you saw a man leave a party in
distress because another man was
wearing the same tuxedo How would
he be able totell No these male
designers they make nice sedate
English-style suits for
themselves Then they make crazy
clothes for women I make clothes
women can wear With dignity

sissy
Maybe people dont want to be
dignified anymore

NATHALIE
Thats obvious Everyone dresses
like children today You used to
be able to tell who was a grownup
A man wore a suit and a tie and
a bat When he came home to his
family after a hard day at work
he might take off his jacket to
relax Maybe loosen his tie
Today if a man actually wore a

‘guit and tie to work the first

thing he does is take them off
when he comes home He immediately
puts on a pair of blue jeans
gneakers and a t-shirt exactly
what he wore when he was 12 years
oid Exactly what his own 12-year-
old is wearing There is no room
for dignity in that mans mind

Fontaine
NATHALIE
You know that he was murdered

TANTPIS
Assuming he was murdered

NATHALIE
Then you dont know for sure

TANTPIS
If we knew anything for sure we
wouldnt be here talking to you
Did he have any enemies

NATHALIE
Everyone has enemies I dont know
if anyone would have gone
to the trouble of killing him

TANTPIS
Madame I understand you had a
special relationship with M de
la Fontaine

NATHALIE
I fail to see what that has to
do with this

TANTPIS
But it is true that for 30 years
youve been lovers quite

publicly

a crime

NATHALIE
‘ ‘Monsieur this is what Ive been

doing for the last 30 years Look
at the shoulders the seams the
pockets The button on the cuff
is open This is quality
workmanship He must have money

TANTPIS looks more carefully at the pictures surprised that
NATHALIE could tell so mich just by observing the seams He
shakes his head

TANTPIS
And this couldnt be done here

NATHALIE
It could It could be done
anywhere But most likely it was
done in London

TANTPIS
I see Thank you
(He hesitates then
piunges in)
Could Olivier have been
homosexual

NATHALIE
(She is momentarily
speechless then
smiles)
Well I suppose anything is
possible From my experience I
would have to say no

LACAN
No Well then thats all for now
By the way do you happen
to know anyone personally who has
an English tailor

NATHALIE
Most of the men in the business
have at least some of their
clothes made in London But thats
assuming the killer is someone
in the business And assuming
Olivier was murdered

is dictating

ULRICH

Haute couture is a luxury even
for the designers who indulge in
it Once the mainstay of their
business the hand-made haute
couture is now little more than
advertising a money-loser that
promotes the profitable part of
the business - the pret-a-porter
the mass-produced ready-to-wear
The irony is that ready-to-wear
is outrageously expensive now
Originally conceived as clothes
affordable to the upper middie
class the clothes shown at the
Pret are now far too expensive
for anyone but the rich to buy
In the meantime haute couture
is slowly heading for extinction

INT - LOUVRE TENT - DAY

The members of the press are arriving at GAULTIERs show What
follows - BINKYs text - will be cut to suit the brilliant

‘visuals that the director is obliged to supply here

BINKY
The value placed on beauty in this
business is symptomatic of exactly
the kind of fuzziness that
characterizes every definition
in fashion Whats beautiful this
year - for instance model Carre
Otis big lips - was anathema in
1970 when every high school girl
wanted to look like the all-
American thin-lipped Cheryl
Tiegs Beauty is a word that gets
tossed around in this business
without regard for standard The
most ordinary-looking MODEL with
looks that might once have
generously been described as
“pleasing today in the
hyperbolic lingo of the fashion
magazine is dubbed peautiful
No one seems to remember that
beauty used to be rare that its
relative scarcity in nature is
part of what makes it noteworthy
and compelling NODELs and movie
stars are routinely called
beautiful these days if they have
a full set of teeth Close
examination of the great beauties
of cinema reveals that the secret
of their allure is dmperfection

169 169

BINKY (Contd)
Sophia Loren with that
foreshortened chin at the end of
an otherwise perfect face that
from the top seems like it might
run on forever The abrupt chin
brings you back to earth This
is a human being you are reminded
by that squashed chin not some
siab of Hellenic statuary The
unfortunate chin flaw forces you
to return in a mesmerizing circle
of motion The eye cant pull
away Then there was the young
Jeanne Moreau with her comical
parody of a pout and a round band
of forehead like a big protective
bumper for her brains Audrey
Hepburn with her huge fist of a
‘pose clenched in the middle of
that wide white face the
proportions receding in breadth
from crown to jaw in the endearing -
ratio of a childs face The large
eyes and ears narrowing to an
underdeveloped jaw like a cartoon
character a sweet fashion plate
Mickey Mouse And Charlotte
Rampling with her bony knob of
a face like some kind of leather
makers tool Buffed and
protuberant at the nose and
cheekbones slitted at the eyes
folded at the mouth And Julie
Christie with her clothes pin-
pinched nostrils and impudent
pendulous lower lip Garbo never
came close to matching these women
in beauty Her perfection emits
all the human perfume of a rock
formation At her best she was
inert unchanging Perhaps this
made looking at her reassuring
She suggested to us that man is
after all perfectable But she
could never be compelling You
looked once and that was enough
There was nothing more to take
in Perfection strikes hard - you
know it when youve seen it and
then you must turn your eyes away
Beauty draws us in becavee cf its
ugliness 5

BINKY (Contd)
Perhaps Sophia Loren in the early
morning after a long night wakes
up chin first so that only the
weaknesses and misproportions are
showcased Flaws help us
recognize ourselves in beautiful
people which is why despite
every reason to despise them we
only envy them We see ourselves
in the truly beautiful only
corrected Our own big noses seem
excusable when we see how well
a big nose can do in the middle
of a more accommodating face -

Under the ideal circumstances all of the living famous women
mentioned above will appear in the film somewhere
