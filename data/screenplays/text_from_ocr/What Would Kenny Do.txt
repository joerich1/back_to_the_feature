EXT TREEHOUSE - SUNSET

We open on an incredible tree house at the top of a large
oak The house appears to have been professionally designed
The craftsmanship is perfect and the view is spectacular

KENNY BELLMORE 17 stands on the edge of the wooden balcony
He is about forty feet high looking down at the earth

KENNY (VO)

I could throw myself right out of
this tree It must be forty feet
I could do a swan dive onto my
head That would definitely kill
me Everybody would blame her
She would feel like shit That
would be great

His cell phone rings Kenny hesitates for a moment then
looks at the caller info He answers

HOLLY
(over phone)
Kenny it’s me

KENNY
Hi

HOLLY
I don’t know if this is such a good
idea but Well look it’s been
five weeks Maybe we can finally
talk about this like adults
quietly and logically

KENNY
I could be logical if you could be
quiet

HOLLY

KENNY (contd)

Or by mature do you mean you wanna
inflate your social status by

frat guys without some high school
boyfriend slowing you down Maybe
you’re just afraid that you won’t
fit in unless you’re getting
wasted getting naked and grabbing
your ankles for some college jock
who swaps your martini for a roofie
cocktail

EXT TREEHOUSE —- LATER THAT AFTERNOON
Kenny is on the treehouse balcony looking over the horizon
After a short while Jared emerges from a hatch in the floor
JARED
So here you are You know I just
walked all the way to that stupid

ice cream place for nothing

KENNY
I wish I’‘d never come down

moment he doesn’t say anything Finally

JARED

Do me a favor dude When you’re
done up here come by the lab
You can kill yourself afterwards

Jared climbs through the hatch and exits

INT JARED’S ATTIC - LATER THAT EVENING

Jared’s attic looks like a mad scientist’s workshop Endless
shelves of tools medical equipment and thick leather-bound
reference books Wires and cables run wild Electronic hums
and beeps in the background There are also typical bedroom
furnishings— stereo television second-hand couch- giving
the attic the appearance of a live-in laboratory

Kenny sits on the couch on the verge of tears as Jared
stages a one-man intervention

JARED
For weeks you’ve been walking
around in this miserable angst-
ridden cloud of shit For a while
I was you know concerned Now
I‘m just getting annoyed

KENNY —
I miss her so much Jared It’s
torture I can’t focus I can’t
sleep I just want this feeling to
end

- about You should be in a coffee
shop strumming an acoustic guitar

KENNY

JARED

‘Im your best friend I’ve known
you since kindergarten and I’m a
genius I’m pretty sure I can
help

(beat)

It’s an experiment actually

KENNY
(laughing a little)
No thank you

JARED
Hear me out I haven’t asked you
to volunteer for anything since
third grade

KENNY

And I broke my legs in third grade
jumping off the roof in that
retarded contraption you designed

JARED
That was DaVinci’s retarded design
(trailing off)
Which I perfected I just didn’t
have the engineering capabilities
(back to the point)
This will be different Safe and
painless But also top secret

KENNY
Yeah I know It’s always top
secret

JARED
No this is actually top secret
As in classified by the United
States government

KENNY ©

JARED (contd)
Theyve been funding me for about
two years

KENNY
You’re working for astronauts

JARED
NASA’‘s not just space exploration
they’re much-

KENNY

I can’t even hold down a job
scooping ice cream and you’re
working for astronauts

JARED
o do you want in

KENNY
Do I want in No of course I
don‘t You broke my legs eight
years ago with your homemade hang-
glider You think Im gonna get in
some friggin’ space shuttle you
built

JARED
It’s nothing like that It’s just
a program A sophisticated multi-
dimensional digital program
(beat)

But here’s the thing Now that
it’s ready I gotta sign it over to
Unele Sam Once I do it never
existed Nobody can know about it

KENNY
Doesn’t your mom know

JARED»
My mom She thinks I’ve been up
here masturbating for two years

KENNY
So what does it have to do with me

Jared narrows his eyes carefully choosing his next words

JARED
What if you could know anything
about your own future What would
you ask

KENNY
Well-

JARED
(quickly interrupting)
And dude if you mention her name
I‘m gonna put on my soccer cleats
and kick you in the balls

KENNY

I just wanna know that everything
will be alright That life does
get better than this Emotionally
socially dermatologically

JARED
Suppose you could have a
conversation with your future self

KENNY
You built a time machine tThat’s
go cool and I am not getting in

JARED
No it’s not a time machine I’m
of the school of thought that time
travel is fundamentally impossible

KENNY
OK me too Fundamentally

JARED

But I do believe- and this is just
a basic philosophy really- that
there is no such thing as chance

There is only causality One thing —

leads to another All of our
actions are pre-determined by the
actions that precede it Call it
destiny if you want but there’s
nothing mystical about it Just
endless cause and effect

KENNY

Do you remember when I fell asleep
during “Matrix Reloaded” I’m
having deja vu

This is trial
f you want get full version please register it thank you
wwwverypdfcom

JARED

Stay with me You see I don’t
subscribe to any time travel
theory but I do believe that it’s
possible to truly conclusively
determine what the future will
bring

KENNY
A-ha Now I totally don’t know
where this is going

JARED

Let’s say you were God ora super-
computer and you had enough memory
and logic to examine past events
and then use them to map the
future That’s what I’ve done
Ive designed a program with
infinite analysis and prediction
capability Big enough to analyze
every person every civilization
every butterfly that ever flapped
its wings If you feed enough
information into this program the
system can recognize and lock into
the patterns of change that the
world is fixed into At that
point the program can predict the
future

KENNY
You said something about me having
a conversation with myself

JARED
You’‘re gonna have a conversation
with the program Every machine
works the same A calculator- you
enter information “2 plus 2” You
ask it a question “What does that
equal” It gives you an answer
“4 A computer a robot- they
work the same way and they’re
given memory even personality
You enter information ask a
question and the machine tells
you “Hello Kenny 2 plus 2 equals
4 By the way you’ve got mail”
You follow me right

KENNY
Gotcha 2 plus 2 equals 4

JARED

My machine works like that It
interacts with you and I can
program it to look sound and
think just like you will twenty
years from now The program will
determine exactly who you’re going
to be and then project that person
for us He will have the
personality and the memories that
you are going to have at age 37

(beat)

So Do you want to meet the
future Kenny or not

KENNY
Ummm What would I have to do

JARED
Well we just strap you in-

Kenny stands shaking his head He’s heard enough
KENNY
Strap me in huh No way in hell
JARED
(quickly backpedals)

Wait wait sit down Bad choice
of words No straps involved

Kenny reluctantly sits again

JARED
I just need to affix a few wires
just harmless little sensors
adhering to your head-

(trailing off)
—to monitor your brain

KENNY
What was that Monitor my what
JARED
Your brain activity The program
reads your thoughts your

knowledge It’s just a way of
entering information Very safe

KENNY
Oh yeah that sounds safe Your
top-secret NASA future machine
reads my mind and that’s it

JARED
That’s it Then Rebecca begins to
process what it-

KENNY
Who’s Rebecca

JARED
Oh thats my name for the program
I named it after Rebecca Rotatori

KENNY
Rebecca Rotatori from school

JARED
I give my inventions female names
And Rebecca Rotatori is such a
goddamned know-it-all so-

KENNY
‘Yeah I get it

JARED
So Rebecca processes everything she
learns about you She uses your
experiences everything you’ve done
and seen to form an understanding
of the world around you She will
recognize and lock into that
universal pattern of change She
will predict the person that you
become And she’ll project it as a
three-dimensional interactive
hologram You following

KENNY
Just because I’m not buying doesn’ Tt
mean I’m not following

JARED
Do you wanna give it a test drive

KENNY

You realize this all sounds absurd
Like I’m gonna wake up in a
hospital bed with my ears ringing
and my pubes burned off

JARED
Oh come on What are the chances
of that happening twice

INT JARED’S ATTIC - A SHORT WHILE LATER

Kenny reclines in something resembling a giant massage chair
Jared presses small suction-cups onto Kenny’s temple each ©
one has a tiny antenna Their signals register on the
monitor of a huge computer network as a digital scan of
Kenny’s brain is assembled

JARED
I’m attaching the last one You
shouldn’t feel a thing

KENNY
I don’t

JARED
Maybe a little tingle here or
there But I think I got all those
bugs worked out so probably not

KENNY
Dude please just stop narrating

JARED
‘You got it Nota word Just tell
me if you get a tingle Or a zap
I‘ll shut up

Jared puts on a giant pair of headphones and punches a few
keys Then from inside the headphones he hears a voice

KENNY ’S VOLCE
(from inside headphones)
Oww oww OWWW Turn it off

Jared looks over at Kenny confused

JARED
Did you say something

Kenny shakes his head

JARED
I think it might be working

sparks shoot out from behind the monitor Kenny’s hair
stands on end and he feels a slight twinge

KENNY

KENNY
I‘m fully expecting you to blow

live I’m breaking contract with
the United States government right
now If you breathe a word to ©
anybody we could spend the rest of
our lives in-

KENNY
Yes I assumed all of that Jared
Let’‘s move this along

Jared reaches up and pulls a heavy curtain across an overhead
track concealing an empty corner Random cables stretch
beneath the curtain connecting Jared’s computer to a thick
gray “Control Pad” on the floor

KENNY
What is that What’s behind there

JARED
It’s a lead curtain The
initiation process generates a bit
of radiation

KENNY
IT thought you said this was safe
JARED
I just closed the curtain We are

safe
Jared clicks his mouse

From behind the curtain a tiny electrical storm begins We
see a few quick flashes The overhead lights dim

We cut to Kenny who is slightly alarmed and then to Jared
who seems to know exactly what he’s doing

The sparks end the lights return to normal wattages and the
equipment becomes quiet The monitor reads “FILE READY”
Jared grins oo

A hand appears It draws the lead curtain back revealing a
person that looks exactly like Kenny twenty years older

This is KENNY 37- slightly taller more filled out Huis face
has aged but it has aged well with maturity in his eyes
and more confidence in his smile He’s dressed casually

peak

KENNY
Physical peak I mean yeah we

Yeah and by the time they are
legal they’re going downhill in an
ice cream truck That’s why me and
you are lucky to be guys Well
one guy actually

KENNY
But don’t girls hit their sexual
peak after high school

KENNY 37

No after high school comes the
freshman fifteen Then stretch
marks Then cankles Then the
sexual peak when they hit 30 once
their standards take a nosedive
Then menopause

KENNY
Call them if you want I don’t

KENNY
I just wanna clear the air
Patterson I’ve never stolen a

dime from you On occasion I over-

rang the register without realizing
it I won’t even fully understand
what an over-ring is until I take

an Intro to Small Business course

two years from now But because
you’re not involved in the day-to-
day operations of this store-
because you have kids teaching —
other kids how to manage the
register- I’ve created financial

discrepancies without ever knowing ©

it You’ve accused and threatened

me and if you’d just been more
professional you could have solved
- everything simply by asking a few

questions Anyway I’m not bitter
In fact I’m relieved to be out of
this dump I’m getting a little
old to be scooping ice cream for a
living and I haveno idea how a
man your age does it

(beat)
By the way four years from now
your wife will finally admit to
herself that she married a closeted
homosexual Then she’ll leave you
Good luck with that

Heather’s mouth drops wide open

Kenny emerges from his bedroom and descends the stairs
Kenny 37 is a step behind Kenny is freshly showered and
sharply dressed but extremely nervous

KENNY 37
Will you just relax Tara
practically invited you

KENNY

Ahhh but she didn’t invite me

She said “Are you going to the
party” She never said “will you

please come to the party” And

that’s how the in-crowd works

They’re very careful not to extend

invitations to anybody who’s not

already invited That’s so the in-

crowd doesn’t get too big

The in-crowd is an illusion Those

better-looking-— ok maybe a few are
slightly better-looking but beauty
is in the eye of the beholder

KENNY
What does that even mean

KENNY 37
It means you’re gonna be holdin’
Tara’s beautiful little ass come
prom time Just trust me

KENNY
‘Hold on I should leave a note

Next to the front door is an escritoire Kenny removes a pen
and pad from the top drawer

KENNY
(as he writes)
Dear Mom and Dad went out ft
infiltrate in-crowd party Be home
after I get kicked out

Kenny finishes his note and puts the pen away Just as hes
about to close the drawer he notices an envelope He takes
it out and unfolds a letter

KENNY 37
What’s that

KENNY 7
Something for Dad Says he had
some kind of physical

KENNY 37
So why are you reading it

KENNY
T‘m curious You know Dad He
wouldn’t go to a doctor if his
balls exploded

Kenny 37 snatches the test results out of Kennys hand

Kenny is driving with Kenny 37 riding shotgun

KENNY
Holly was always my ticket into
these things Except the great
thing about having a girlfriend was
not having to go Most Friday
nights we would just stay in and-

KENNY 37
And not have sex Yeah I know
Those were the days Listen once
we do get to the party stop crow-
barring her into every
conversation Nobody wants to hear
about your ex Oe

KENNY
I didn’t crow-bar anybody

KENNY 37
There is only one situation in
which it benefits you to refer to
the ex-girlfriend Repeat after
me “My ex-girlfriend didn’t like
giving oral sex either”

KENNY
I don’t get it

KENNY 37
You will Trust me

KENNY
The point is Skip Palumbo doesn’t
even know our name What makes you
think he’s gonna let us in

EXT TRAFFIC LIGHT-— A MOMENT LATER

The light turns red The Prelude rolls to a stop in the left
lane Kenny’s Nova pulls up next to them in the right lane

Kenny waves nervously and gets the attention of one of the
girls She rolls down her window already expecting a pick-
up

KENNY
Hi Um were late for a big
party Do any of you know how to

A secret party

FIRST GIRL
(bitchy)
If it was worth going to I’m sure

KENNY
(quietly to Kenny 37)
I think we can tell them Kenny

KENNY 37
— (to Kenny)
Shut up
(to the girls)

I don’t mean to be rude But you
see our girlfriends are in Cancun
And we promised them that we
wouldn’‘t hang out with any
attractive young ladies while

THIRD GIRL
Youre girlfriends are an Cancun

KENNY 37

KENNY
Dude you’re a genius Ima

KENNY 37

No you were right the first time

KENNY
How did that even happen You

KENNY 37
Let me tell you what goes on inside
a hot chick’s brain Number one
They hate other girls All girls
They hate girls they know They
hate girls they don’t know They

hate their best friends They hate

everybody

KENNY
Makes sense

KENNY 37
Number two Hot chicks can not

resist screwing with somebody

else’s devoted boyfriend They

thrive on it And therein lies the

irony The hot ones are the most
insecure

(beat)
Every once in a while you should
stop and listen to what girls
actually say to each other They
can have entire conversations of
insecure jibberish

KENNY
I kinda pride myself on being the

shit—housed every weekend

KENNY 37
Yes I know you respect yourself
you think for yourself- that’s all
great But sobriety can be
dangerous Sobriety increases your
inhibitions lowers your
confidence and accelerates your
motor skills Do you really want
to take that risk

KENNY
What brand do you recommend Do I
have an option

KENNY 37
Yeah here’s your option You can
have two beers tonight in
moderation and get a little buzz
going Or you never touch a drink
until you get to college and then
as soon as you’re away from home
with no adult supervision you
freak out and get bathroom-floor-
wasted every night until youre
fat and broke and failing out of
school There’s one in every dorm

At that point two cute girls KERRI and DANIELLE pass by

The girls exit the scene Kenny just looks at Kenny 37
astonished

KENNY
What have you been doing

KENNY 37
Molding young minds

KENNY
Dude you are way too old to be
molding anything of theirs

KENNY 37
Would you relax Come on lLet’s
find you a beer

INT PARTY — A SHORT WHILE LATER

Kenny and Kenny 37 are on a couch in the corner as Kenny
polishes off his first beer of the night After a last gulp

but when do we get to the important
stuff Like how do I trick girls
into wanting to have sex with me

KENNY 37
(exasperated)
OK for starters Stop staring at
that brunette with the hoops

KENNY
Io am so not staring I checked her
out a few times but-—

KENNY 37
She knows you’re looking She
knows I know the neighbors know

KENNY
But I hardly even-

KENNY 37

You see what I’m doing Talking to

Kenny 37 stares at Kenny without blinking

just felt her up with my eyes and
you missed it

KENNY 37 (contd)
Wanna know her cup size 32C
Maybe 34 That’s the way you gotta
do it You find that special
special girl and you plan your
attack But if she catches you
looking she anticipates the
attack

KENNY
It‘s not that easy

KENNY 37
Sure it is If you believe in
yourself high school is like the
opposite of a strip club You can
have any girl you want you just
can’t stare

At that point something catches Kenny 37‘s eye

On the opposite side of the room Holly is chatting with a
stocky FOOTBALL-TYPE GUY in a varsity jacket

FOOTBALL GUY
So I leave for football camp right
after graduation but I was thinking
maybe we could keep in touch

HOLLY
Um sure How ‘bout I get your e-
Mail address Hold this

She hands him a martini glass then searches her purse for a
pen Football Guy places her drink on the nearest tabletop

Fortunately Kenny has his back to them Only Kenny 37
notices

KENNY
Should we work the room a little

KENNY 37
Let’ s just do what you came here to
do Right now Tara is in the

drop-dead-jerk-off gorgeous

KENNY
I’m not ready I can’t ask her to
the prom I can’t even friend-
request her on myspace And
believe me I’ve tried I lose my
nerve every time

KENNY 37
More than anything else girls are
attracted to confidence Not
phoniness or cockiness or Ashton
Kutcher asshole-ness Just genuine

confidence

KENNY

Tara Stefanchik is not a girl

She’‘s a goddess Shes like God’ Ss
hot little sister

KENNY 37
And you have an advantage over
every guy here You have me your
future self telling you
definitively how it can be done

Here are your lines

INT PARTY KITCHEN - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Dozens of liquor bottles line the counter-tops Kenny enters
the kitchen and approaches Tara as she fixes herself a shot
He is clearly nervous but manages to be somewhat charming

KENNY
Hey Tara

TARA
Hey Kenny You made it

KENNY

TARA

decided to over-compensate

TARA
But I don’t think you‘re not

KENNY
Wow What a tremendous compliment
I don’t think you’re not good
looking either

- Holly stares for a moment then quickly exits the scene

Kenny begins to lean on Kenny 37 for support

KENNY
I wanna lay down I just need a

Suddenly Kenny seems to fall right through Kenny 37

Somebody’s up

KENNY ’S MOM (0S)

-- We cut to Kenny’s Mom wearing a nightgown standing just
outside the door

Inside the bathroom Kenny 37 puts a finger to his lips
instructing Kenny to stay quiet

KENNY 37
(raises his vocal pitch
imitates Kenny perfectly)
Yeah Mom Just me

KENNY ’S MOM

Kenny’s Mom growing suspicious reaches for the doorknob

37 blocks it Through the crack of the doorway we can seé
some of his face but it’s covered by a thick green paste

INT KENNY’S ROOM -— THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON

Kenny opens his eyes still sleepy and very hung-over The
first thing he sees is Kenny 37 poking around in the closet

KENNY
What are you doing

KENNY 37
I‘m revising your wardrobe We
need to talk about some of these
articles )
(points to the left side)
This side of the closet is OK You
got some cool stuff in here stuff
that wont repel the opposite sex
(points to the right side)
Now you see this side The larger
Side We’re in luck because I
think it’s all flammable

KENNY
(pointing to an ugly
tattered t-shirt)
What about that MThat’s my Warped
Tour t-shirt

KENNY 37
You need to stop wearing it to
school before they move you to
Special Ed

KENNY
It proves that I was there

KENNY 37
It proves that youre colorblind
and that you need to have a garage
sale

Kenny sits up to argue but his head immediately begins to
throb

KENNY
Ahhhh What happened last night

KENNY 37
Well you laid some serious
groundwork with some very cute
girls You got a few phone
numbers Then you got as drunk as
Mel Gibson’s mug shot

KENNY
Did I hook up

KENNY 37
No but you went down on a toilet
for about an hour Which reminds
me Nicole Bender is gonna call you
tonight You made quite an
impression

KENNY
“Back-Seat Bender” Really

Again Kenny attempts to sit up but moves too quickly

KENNY
Ahhhh God my head

KENNY 37
Do yourself a favor Go
downstairs Have some orange
Gatorade and a little bit of
oatmeal In the meantime I‘ve got
some laundry to burn

INT KITCHEN - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Kenny is at the table with a small bowl of oatmeal and a
huge Gatorade He eats slowly determined to keep it down

Kenny ’s Dad enters wearing his robe holding a drink He
removes a small vile of pills from the back of the cupboard
then glances over his shoulder

When Kenny isn’t looking his Dad pops two pills into his
mouth He washes them down then sits down next to Kenny

KENNY ’S DAD

Dad is there something on your-
(suddenly appalled)
Are you drinking already

KENNY ‘S DAD
Just a little eye-opener while your
-™mom’s doing her yoga stretches

KENNY
Don’t you think it’s kinda early

KENNY ’S DAD
I’m gonna let you in on a Bellmore
family secret A little alcohol
does wonders for the sexual
stamina

KENNY
Dad I could fill that whole sink
with vomit right now Right to the
brim

Kenny’s Dad stands up from the table

KENNY’S DAD
‘Ill leave you to your lunch Just
remember champ A little bit of
the firewater turns the old meat-
whistle into solid rock

INT KENNY’S ROOM -— LATER THAT EVENING

Kenny 37 rummages through the closet as Kenny sits on the
bed complaining

KENNY 37
Take it easy on your old man He’s
just trying to relate to you And
he’s not gonna be around forever

KENNY
Ever since he retired they’ve been
on this second honeymoon It’s
repulsive

KENNY 37
Dad worked hard and took care of
himself all his life He’s finally
loosening up and he deserves it

KENNY OO

I gotta listen to it Being a

parents rubbing it in

KENNY 37

Thats why we need to get your dong

off the bench and into centerfield

- ‘KENNY
When does she call

KENNY 37
Well you can’t just sit there
waiting for it

KENNY
Maybe I should call her

KENNY 37

Why would you do a thing like that

KENNY
Because I wanna talk to her

KENNY 37

No you don’t She offered to call
you first That’s good It’s like
she’s volunteering to be the guy

You have the rare opportunity to be

the girl Being the girl is much
much easier If you get impatient
and call her first that’s like
reclaiming all of the pressure and
prefaces of being a guy

KENNY

Well I am impatient Now that I
know she’s attainable I suddenly
find her very interesting

KENNY 37

As soon as you’re not expecting the

call she’ll call So let’s just’

change the subject
(beat)

Isn’t there anything else on your

mind Anything- big or small

KENNY
OK Well this is a big one I
guess Do you believe in God
(MORE)

«BO
KENNY (contd)

Are you religious Are you
spiritual Do you really believe

all bullshit aside that you have a

purpose I mean why are you here

KENNY 37
Wow those are big questions And
you know the older I get the more
I analyze that stuff But I think
after 37 years I finally have some
answers Basically life is all
about-

Kenny’s cell phone rings He grabs it

KENNY

exact amount of relaxation

KENNY 37
She’s in her pajamas Pajamas are
a big advantage No belt buckles
no buttons no Zippers none of
those little roadblocks that give
her time to think about reasons not
to have sex with you It’s nothing
but elastic down there Elastic
equals sex By the way her
parents are divorced We don’t
really have time to get into the
Freudian stuff but that’s gonna
work in your favor too

KENNY

KENNY 37
Listen to me dude What you say

Say it When two people really
start digging each other the
English language goes right out the
window You’re gonna be thinking
about what you say next she’s
gonna be thinking about what she
says next so neither of you are
gonna hear a goddamn word anyway

Now your mother tells me youve
had some difficulty with calculus

KENNY 37
Not so much difficulty as complete
and total apathy

KNAPP
(opening a book) -
Maybe I can be of help Youll
have to read me the formulas but-

KENNY 37
Let’s be realistic Mr Knapp
After high school Im basically
never gonna use calculus again for
the rest of my life

KNAPP
Come now Kenny that’s nonsense
People use calculus every day
Now let’s just imagine you’re oh
say a mathematician for example-

KENNY 37
Mr Knapp I’m pretty sure about
this There’s basically one single
occasion in my adult life when it
might be useful That would be in
Vegas on my twenty-sixth birthday
as I attempt to use calculus to
beat the roulette table

(beat)

Actually if you could show me a
formula for that

gingle piece of advice would you
give yourself

KNAPP
I‘d go back to ‘52 back to Korea
and Id tell myself to use a
contraceptive Those panheads have
rashes that the civilized world has
never even heard of

Kenny 37 doesn’t respond He seems distracted

KNAPP
What’s really on your mind son
Something’s bothering you and it’s
not this test

KENNY 37
(takes a deep breath)
I’ve misled you Mr Knapp I’m
not Kenny I’m just a friend of
his doing a good impression

KNAPP
Why would you do that Wheres
Kenny

KENNY 37
Its a long story I‘m just doing
hima favor You see Kenny is
How do I put this unfamiliar
with the Great Pink Stink

KNAPP
(laughing)
Kenny’s still a virgin

KENNY 37
Yeah

KNAPP
Oh my my my Son when I was
growing up in the Capitol City any
young man who was still a virgin on
his seventeenth birthday would get
a visit from the local fire chief
(MORE)

KNAPP (contd)
And the fire chief would take you
down to see this colored girl who
would play a tune on your skin
flute for fifty cents Fifty
cents back then And-

KENNY 37
The point is Kenny is ten blocks
away on a big date with a girl
named Nicole Bender So you see-

KNAPP
“Back-—-seat Bender”

KENNY 37 -
He- yes you know her

KNAPP
I know of her I may be going
blind but I still hear OK And
from what I hear that girl loves
the cock

KENNY 37
So you get it That’s the reason
for this whole charade Kenny
needs to slam some ham and this is
the first chance he’s ever had

KNAPP
Well screw calculus
(closes the book)
You can cram for these aptitude
tests in a couple of hours Sex
on the other hand Now that
takes practice 7

And it’s raining ©

KENNY 37
(snatches the keys)
Exactly That‘s perfect Rain is
dramatic You should be running
through the rain

KENNY
Why does it have to be dramatic

KENNY 37
Kenny this is the single most
important thing that I’m gonna pass
on to you Girls need

KENNY
Holly Holly it’s me

After a moment Holly answers the door When she sees Kenny
standing there dripping wet she’s a little annoyed

- HOLLY»
Kenny-—
KENNY
Please don’t say anything
(beat)

I love you so much Holly I’m
gonna love you ‘til the day I die
Even if this has to end

(beat)

And if I’ve made this difficult
I’m sorry I just hope you realize
that wherever you go whatever you
do I’ll be here for you if you
need me

He grabs her by the waist pulling her towards him Before
she can react Kenny kisses her It’s a strong final kiss
When he finally releases her she looks kind of dumbstruck

Kenny exits the scene leaving Holly alone on her doorstep
At first she’s confused But as it sinks in she’s touched

EXT TREEHOUSE - JUST AFTER SUNRISE

Kenny and Kenny 37 are in the treehouse looking out over the
sunrise and waiting for Jared to arrive

KENNY 7
And then I kissed her And it
wasn’t even like a sad goodbye
kiss It was just perfect
closure Is that how you remember
it

KENNY 37
Like it was yesterday

Both of them are silent for a little while Finally

KENNY 37

Six or seven years from now some
asshole developer bulldozes all of
this Turns it into a strip mall

KENNY
Are you serious That’s bullshit

KENNY 37

There’s a counting Crows song that
goes “I can’t remember all the
times I tried to tell myself to
hold on to these moments as they
pass

KENNY
(a little disgusted)
You listen to Counting Crows

KENNY 37
Some of the mellow stuff sinks in
as you get older The point is
you can’t hold on to anything You
gotta try to appreciate the
present Very few of us do

JARED

Jared appears climbing up through the hatch

JARED

KENNY
(checks his watch)

JARED

Kenny turns towards Kenny 37 It’s a short sweet goodbye

KENNY 37

When I was 27 Holly and I bumped
into each other at a concert Got
to talking catching up Before ©

changed We had changed For the
better

Keep that to yourself These
things only work out if you’re not
expecting them

JARED
I always liked her you know

KENNY 37

Holly and I both agree that it
wouldn’t have worked when we were
younger We had to grow up first
We needed to meet other people
We needed to love other people
before either of us really knew
for sure who we were meant for
