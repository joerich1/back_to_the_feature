Brain damage

The students quickly quiet down as Keating emerges from the other room
whistling the 1812 Overture He walks up the length of the classroom and
out the door without a word The students look around at one another
uncertain of what to do Keating pokes his head back in the doorway

KEATING
Well come on

He gestures them to follow and the students after some hesitation grab
their books and follow Keating out into the main entranceway
INT ENTRANCEWAY - DAY

Keating stands before the schools trophy cabinets and waits until all
the boys arrive

KEATING
Oh Captain My Captain who knows where
that comes from

Todd looks up as if he knows the answer but says nothing Spaz blows his
nose a little too close to Meeks for his liking

KEATING
Not a clue Its from a poem by Walt
Whitman about Mr Abraham Lincoln Now in
this class you can call me Mr Keating Or
if youre slightly more daring Oh Captain
My Captain

The students laugh slightly

KEATING
Now let me dispel a few rumors so they
dont fester into facts Yes I too
attended Hell-ton and survived And no
at that time I was not the mental giant
you see before you I was the intellectual
equivalent of a ninety-eight pound
weakling I would go to the beach and
people would kick copies of Byron in my
face

The boys laugh once again while Cameron obviously trying to write all
this down looks around confusedly Keating looks down at papers in his
hand

KEATING
Now Mr Pitts Thats a rather
unfortunate name Mr Pitts where are
you

Pitts raises his hand while everyone around him snickers
KEATING
Mr Pitts would you open your hymnal to page 542 and read the first

stanza of the poem you find there

PITTS
To the virgins to make much of time

KEATING
Yes thats the one Somewhat appropriate

isnt it

PITTS
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may old
time is still a flying and this same
flower that smiles today tomorrow will
be dying

KEATING
Thank you Mr Pitts Gather ye rosebuds
while ye may The Latin term for that
sentiment is Carpe Diem Now who knows
what that means

Meeks immediately puts his hand up

MEEKS
Carpe Diem Thats seize the day

KEATING
Very good Mr-

MEEKS
Meeks

KEATING

Meeks Another unusual name Seize the
day Gather ye rosebuds while ye may
Why does the writer use these lines

CHARLIE
Because hes in a hurry

KEATING
No ding

Keating slams his hand down on an imaginary buzzer

KEATING
Thank you for playing anyway Because we
are food for worms lads Because believe
it or not each and every one of us in
this room is one day going to stop
breathing turn cold and die

Keating turns towards the trophy cases filled with trophies footballs
and team pictures

KEATING
Now I would like you to step forward over
here and peruse some of the faces from
the past Youve walked past them many
times I dont think youve really looked
at them

The students slowly gather round the cases and Keating moves behind them
KEATING

Theyre not that different from you are
they Same haircuts Full of hormones
just like you Invincible just like you
feel The world is their oyster They
believe theyre destined for great things
just like many of you Their eyes are full
of hope just like you Did they wait until
it was too late to make from their lives
even one iota of what they were capable
Because you see gentlmen these boys are
now fertilizing daffodils But if you listen
real close you can hear them whisper their
legacy to you Go on lean in

The boys lean in and Keating hovers over Camerons shoulder
KEATING
(whispering in a gruff voice)
Carpe
Cameron looks over his shoulder with an aggravated expression on his face
KEATING
Hear it
(whispering again)
Carpe Carpe Diem Seize the day boys
make your lives extraordinary
The boys stare at the faces in the cabinet in silence

PITTS

Meeks holds up the antenna as if demonstrating it
INT KEATINGS CLASSROOM - DAY

Keating sits at his desk at the front of the classroom and opens up one
of his books

KEATING
Gentlemen open your text to page
twenty-one of the introduction Mr
Perry will you read the opening
paragraph of the preface entitled
Understanding Poetry

NEIL
Understanding Poetry by Dr J Evans
Pritchard PhD To fully understand
poetry we must first be fluent with

its meter rhyme and figures of speech
Then ask two questions One how artfully
has the objective of the poem been
rendered and two how important is that
objective Question one rates the poems
perfection question two rates its
importance And once these questions have
been answered determining a poems
greatest becomes a relatively simple
matter

Keating gets up from his desk and prepares to draw on the chalk board

NEIL
If the poems score for perfection is
plotted along the horizontal of a graph
and its importance is plotted on the
vertical then calculating the total
area of the poem yields the measure of
its greatness

Keating draws a corresponding graph on the board and the students
dutifully copy it down

NEIL
A sonnet by Byron may score high on the
vertical but only average on the
horizontal A Shakespearean sonnet on
the other hand would score high both
horizontally and vertically yielding a
massive total area thereby revealing the
poem to be truly great As you proceed
through the poetry in this book practice
this rating method As your ability to
evaluate poems in this matter grows so
will - so will your enjoyment and
understanding of poetry

Neil sets the book down and takes off his glasses The student sitting
across from him is discretely trying to eat Keating turns away from
the chalkboard with a smile

KEATING
Excrement Thats what I think of Mr J
Evans Pritchard Were not laying pipe
were talking about poetry

Cameron looks down at the graph he copied into his notes and quickly
scribbles it out

KEATING
I mean how can you describe poetry like
American Bandstand I like Byron I give
him a 42 but I cant dance to it

Charlie suddenly appear to become interested in the class
KEATING
Now I want you to rip out that page

The students look at Keating as if he has just gone mad

KEATING
Go on rip out the entire page You heard
me rip it out Rip it out

Charlie looks around at the others He then looks down at his own notes
which consists of drawing breasts

KEATING
Go on rip it out

Charlie rips the page out and holds it up

KEATING
Thank you Mr Dalton Gentlemen tell you
what dont just tear out that page tear
out the entire introduction I want it
gone history Leave nothing of it Rip
it out Rip Begone J Evans Pritchard
PhD Rip shred tear Rip it out I
want to hear nothing but ripping of Mr
Pritchard

Meeks looks around reluctantly and then finally begins tearing out pages

KEATING
Well perforate it put it ona roll

Keating sees Cameron still hesitating
KEATING
Its not the bible youre not going to
go to hell for this Go on make a clean
tear I want nothing left of it

Keating goes over to his room Cameron turns around to Neil

CAMERON
We shouldnt be doing this

NEIL
Rip rip rip

Neil makes Cameron turn back around

KEATING (0S)
Rip it out rip

From outside the classroom Mr McAllister hears all the noise and sees
all the students ripping out the pages He bursts into the room

MCALLISTER
What the hell is going on here

The boys all turn around in shock Charlie stuffs a crumpled page into
mouth Keating emerges from his room with a waste paper basket

KEATING
I dont hear enough rips

MCALLISTER
Mr Keating
KEATING
Mr McAllister
MCALLISTER
Im sorry I- I didnt know you were
here
KEATING
I am
MCALLISTER

Ahh so you are Excuse me

Mr McAllister slowly backs out of the classroom

KEATING
Keep ripping gentlemen This is a battle
a war And the casualties could be your
hearts and souls

Keating holds out the basket to Charlie who spits out a wad of paper

KEATING
Thank you Mr Dalton Armies of academics
going forward measuring poetry No we
will not have that here No more of Mr
Jd Evans Pritchard Now in my class you
will learn to think for yourselves again
You will learn to savor words and language
No matter what anybody tells you words and
ideas can change the world I see that look
in Mr Pitts eye like nineteenth century
literature has nothing to do with going to
business school or medical school Right
Maybe Mr Hopkins you may agree with him
thinking Yes we should simply study our
Mr Pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter
and go quietly about the business of
achieving other ambitions I have a little
secret for ya Huddle up Huddle up

his

The boys get up from their seats and gather around Keating in the center

of the class

KEATING
We dont read and write poetry because
its cute We read and write poetry

because we are members of the human race
And the human race is filled with passion
Medicine law business engineering

these are all noble pursuits and necessary
to sustain life But poetry beauty
romance love these are what we stay alive
for To quote from Whitman O me o life
of the questions of these recurring of the
endless trains of the faithless of cities
filled with the foolish What good amid
these o me o life Answer that you are
here That life exists and identity

That the powerful play goes on and you

may contribute a verse That the powerful
play goes on and you may contribute a verse

Keating looks up at Todd

Keating
What will your verse be

INT HEAD OF CAFETERIA - DAY

The cafeteria is filled with students and teachers standing before the tables
saying grace

ALL
For what we are about to receive may the
Lord make us truly grateful Amen

Mr Keating and Mr McAllister are seated next to one another at the table

MCALLISTER
Quite an interesting class you gave today
Mr Keating

KEATING
Im sorry if I shocked you Mr McAllister

MCALLISTER
Oh theres no need to apologize It was
very fascinating misguided though it was

KEATING
You think so

MCALLISTER
You take a big risk by encouraging them to
be artists John When they realize theyre
not Rembrandts Shakespeares or Mozarts
theyll hate you for it

KEATING
Were not talking artists George were
talking free thinkers
MCALLISTER
Free thinkers at seventeen

KEATING
Funny I never pegged you as a cynic

MCALLISTER
(taken aback by the comment)
Not a cynic a realist Show me the heart
unfettered by foolish dreams and Ill
show you a happy man

KEATING
But only in their dreams can man be truly
free Twas always thus and always thus
will be

MCALLISTER
Tennyson

KEATING
No Keating

Keating winks and Mr McAllister cant help but laugh

INT CAFETERIA TABLE - DAY

NEIL
Why What was it

KEATING
Gentlemen can you keep a secret

NEIL

The other boys crouch down around Keating

KEATING
The Dead Poets were dedicated to sucking
the marrow out of life Thats a phrase
from Thoreau that wed invoke at the
beginning of each meeting You see wed
gather at the old Indian cave and take
turns reading from Thoreau Whitman
Shelley the biggies Even some of our
own verse And in the enchantment of the
moment wed let poetry work its magic

KNOX
You mean it was a bunch of guys sitting
around reading poetry

KEATING
No Mr Overstreet it wasnt just guys
we werent a Greek organization we were
romantics We didnt just read poetry
we let it drip from our tongues like honey
Spirits soared women swooned and gods
were created gentlemen not a bad way to
spend an evening eh Thank you Mr Perry
for this trip down amnesia lane Burn that

remains crouched

Neil lit up by a flashlight begins to tell everyone a story

NEIL

It was a dark and rainy night and this
old lady who had a passion for jigsaw
puzzles sat by herself in her house at
her table to complete a new jigsaw puzzle
But as she pieced the puzzle together she
realized to her astonishment that the
image that was formed was her very own
room And the figure in the center of the
puzzle as she completed it was herself
And with trembling hands she placed the
last four pieces and stared in horror at
the face of a demented madman at the
window The last thing that this old lady
ever heard was the sound of breaking glass

BOYS
Ohhh no

NEIL
This is true this is true

CAMERON

day at dawn with her nightshift on

the poem

CHARLIE

Neil sits reading from the book by flashlight

NEIL
Alfred Lord Tennyson
Come my friends
Tis not too late to seek a newer world
for my purpose holds to sail beyond the
sunset
And though we are not now that strength
which in old days
Moved earth and heaven that which we
are we are--
One equal temper of heroic hearts
Made weak by time and fate but strong
in will
To strive to seek to find and not to
yield

Meeks takes center stage and begins reading a poem like he is
performing a chant

MEEKS
Then I had religion then I hada
vision

derision
Then I saw the Congo creeping through

Keating holds out his right arm dramtically and begins to
speak in an exaggerated British accent

Charlie and Neil quickly rise from their seats to go to the front
of the classroom The rest of the class follows them While Keating
continues speaking Neil and Charlie join him on the desk and then
Keating jumps down

KEATING
Just when you think you know something
you have to look at it in another way
Even though it may seem silly or wrong
you must try Now when you read dont
just consider what the author thinks
Consider what you think

KEATING
Boys you must strive to find your own
voice Because the longer you wait to
begin the less likely you are to find
it at all Thoreau said Most men lead
lives of quiet desperation Dont be
resigned to that Break out

Keating notices Spaz and another boy leaving the desk immediately

KEATING
Dont just walk off the edge like lemmings
Look around you

The school bell rings as the boys continue to climb onto the desk
Keating begins to gather up his stuff The clock begins to toll as
Keating walks to the back of the class

There There you go Mr Priske Thank
you Yes Dare to strike out and find

off and on while chanting ominously

aloud in front of the class on Monday

Keating steps out into the hall before quickly peeking back in once again
Todd is the last one to stand on the desk and is about to jump off

Maybe not I dont know

Keating begins walking with his groin pushed forward
KEATING
Mr Overstreet driven by deeper force
Yes We know that All right Now I
didnt bring them up here to ridicule
them I brought them up here to illustrate
the point of conformity the difficulty in
maintaining your own beliefs in the face
of others Now those of you -- I see
the look in your eyes like I wouldve
walked differently Well ask
yourselves why you were clapping Now
we all have a great need for acceptance
But you must trust that your beliefs are
unique your own even though others may
think them odd or unpopular even though
the herd may go Thats baaaaad Robert
Frost said Two roads diverged ina
wood and I I took the one less traveled
by and that has made all the
difference Now I want you to find
your own walk right now Your own way of
striding pacing Any direction
Anything you want Whether its proud
whether its silly anything Gentlemen

INT THEATER - NIGHT

The audience is packed The stage is set up to resemble a forest and

crown of twigs and berries and twigs on his hands In the audience
Charlie emerges from his seat all excited

CHARLIE
Hey there he is Hey hey

Cameron shoves him back into his seat

KEATING
Shh boys

On stage Neil hides behind a tree as a girl emerges similarly clad
but with flowers in her hair Neil sneaks over to the girl

FAIRY

Either I mistake your shape and making
quite

Or else you are that shrewd and knavish
sprite

Calld Robin Goodfellow

PUCK
Thou speakst aright
In the audience Chris and Knox enter and are shown to seats

PUCK
I am that merry wanderer of the night
I jest to Oberon and make him smile
When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile

Puck makes horse sounds and the audience laughs

PUCK
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal
And sometime lurk I in a gossips bowl
In very likeness of a roasted crab
And when she drinks against her lips I
bob
And on her witherd dewlap pour the ale
The wisest aunt telling the saddest
tale

In the audience Charlie leans over towards Keating
CHARLIE
(whispering)
Hes good Hes really good
Keating gives a thumbs up

PUCK

Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh
me
Then slip I from her bum down topples
she
And tailor cries and falls into a

cough

And then the whole quire hold their hips
and laugh

And waxen in their mirth and neeze and
swear

A merrier hour was never wasted there
But room Fairy here comes Oberon

FAIRY

And here my mistress Would that he were
gone

The two actors hide behind the trees lifting their twig covered
hands to hide themselves

INT THEATER - NIGHT
Two other actors are onstage
LYSANDER

Then by your side no bed-room me deny
For lying so Hermia I do not lie

HERMIA

Lysander riddles very prettily

Now much beshrew my manners and my
pride

If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied
But gentle friend for love and
courtesy

Lie further off in human modesty

Such separation as may well be said
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid
and good night sweet friend

Thy love neer alter till thy sweet life
end

Neil is watching the actors from the wing He glances out at the audience
and sees his father enter the back of the theater Neil backs away into
the shadows
LYSANDER

INT THEATER - NIGHT

The stage is dark A spotlight comes on to reveal Neil with his back to
the audience He slowly turns around to face the audience and his father

PUCK
If we shadows have offended

Neil directs his eyes at his father who stills stands at the back
of the theater

PUCK
Think but this and all is mended
That you have but slumberd here
While these visions did appear
And this weak and idle theme
No more yielding but a dream
Gentles do not reprehend
If you pardon we will mend
And as I am an honest Puck
If we have unearned luck
Now to scape the serpents tongue
We will make amends ere long
Else the Puck a liar call
So good night unto you all
Give me your hands if we be friends
And Robin shall restore amends

Neil backs away and the curtains close as the audience begins to
applaud enthusiastically Behind the curtain numerous people
congratulate Neil as they line up for the curtain call The curtains
open Charlie and the other boys rise to their feet followed quickly

MR NOLAN

I have here a detailed description of
what occurred at your meetings It

describes

how your teacher Mr Keating

encouraged you boys to organize this
club and to use it as a source of
inspiration for reckless and self-

indulgent

behavior It describes how Mr

Keating both in and out of the

classroom

encouraged Neil Perry to

follow his obsession with acting when he
knew all along it was against the
explicit order of Neils parents It was
Mr Keatings blatant abuse of his
position as teacher that led directly to
Neil Perrys death

Mr Nolan motions to Todd
paper to Todd

carefully

Todd looks at the paper

slaps the open page

MR NOLAN
Read

As Cameron begins to read Keating looks out at Todd as he puts
his scarf on Todd looks at him for a moment and then glances away

CAMERON
Understanding Poetry by Dr J Evans
Pritchard PhD To fully understand
poetry we must first be fluent with its
meter rhyme and figures of speech then
ask two questions 1) How artfully has
the objective of the poem been rendered
and 2)

The door squeaks as Keating shuts it behind him Cameron pauses

CAMERON
How important is that objective
Question 1 rates the poems perfection
question 2 rates its importance And
once these questions have been answered
determining the poems greatness becomes
a relatively simple matter If the
poems score for perfection is plotted
on the horizontal of a graph--

Keating passes by Todd and the others and gets to the back of the
classroom before Todd leaps up from his seat and turns to face him

TODD
Mr Keating They made everybody sign
it
