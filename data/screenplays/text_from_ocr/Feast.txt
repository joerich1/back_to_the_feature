EXT DESERT -- DAY

The white sun beats down on the rocky terrain Theres
cloud in the blue sky and the wind is at a standstill
Far in the distance a MEDIUM SIZED FLAT-BED TRUCK
way to the entrance of a large cavern opening Two
perched on a barren tree watch the intruders

EXT DESERT -- DAY

The truck screeches to a dusty stop Three men in
coveralls and hard hats jump from the cab CHIEF (42
weary) LANKY (32 withered) and COLLEGE BOY (23 clean
and naive)

Chief holds a map and glares into the howling black

Last winter a man kidnapped a little
girl and holed up in one of these
caves The cops had him pinned down
and began to move in This guy started
shooting but he wasnt aiming at
the officers

(getting closer)
he was firing at something inside

College Boy is rapt

CHIEF
When the dust cleared all they found
was the little girls shoes

With the feet still in em
Something GRABS College Boys ankles causing him to

As Chief moves forward pulling out his pick-axe

Instantly the cave is illuminated by a white
floodlight A

group of GREENPEACE HIPPIE ACTIVISTS stand in the cave

CHAINED TOGETHER at the waist startling the men into

launched

a thousand craps) barks into a MINI BULLHORN that hangs
around

In unison the hippies start CHANTING

And we have an injunction from the
State to prevent any dumping in these
caverns This is virgin land The
aqueducts in these caves bring
drinking water to our families and
its piping provides drainage for our
farms that enrich this barren land
And it wont be tainted by waste of
any kind Not now Not ever

Chief shaken confirms the injunction and hands it
back

Fine just back off

He snaps his fingers motioning to the barrel

Like me

HEROINE
Fine

Para stares intently at the map Adulterer moves over
to the

window that has shutters over it peeking through a
hole

ADULTERER
Maybe these things are like locusts
or something and only come out for a
few days to feed This could just be
a part of their life cycle

BELLE
Somebodys gotta know something about
these things This stuff just doesnt
happen out of the blue

The room is silent Bozo looks around quickly moving
towards

Hey where was your farm
HEROINE
(points to map)
East Why

PARA
Did you ever slaughter Slaughter
livestock

HEROINE

Previous owners did I think

COACH
What are you talking about

PARA
Slaughterhouse run-off used to be
drained into piping that ran through
the mountains

Para points along the map as he explains

PARA
Earthquakes often cracked the piping
and those flow lines were condemned
but never drained

COACH
Cheese n rice

TRAMPY
I still dont get it

PARA

What am saying is theres a
distinct possibility that what we

are up against is the result of steady
stream of blood and tissue that has
been leaking into the caves And a

day ago something broke out

The group is silent

BOZO
The first order of business is gettin
a big fuckin tampon in that cave

PARA
Nope that wouldnt do it

FROM ADULTERERS POV - He peeks out the hole and
sees

nothing but the dark night Bartender eyes him
