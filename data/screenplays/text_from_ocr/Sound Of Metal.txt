SOUND OF METAL

written by

Darius Marder and Abraham Marder
HE HEARS HEAVY FEEDBACK BUILDING AND SQUEALING

INT CLUB STAGE - NIGHT

Harsh white lights illuminate RUBEN beady eyes punk-
like weathered boyish face and tattoos everywhere Hes
waiting intensely for the beginning for it all to start
He looks up and his focus locks in tight on Lou an
assured freak creature dressed in black with an air of
royalty about her The loop of her sound grows Guitar pedals
and synthesizers lay on the stage floor as she looks to Ruben
with a suddenly manic intensity She picks up her beat up
Telecaster and strikes a chord with surprising menace She
stomps on her looping pedal The sound hisses low wild and
bracing Ruben stares and waits poised he can almost
taste her sweat She flashes a quick glance toward him and
Ruben unleashes bringing the sticks down upon his drums with
pure demonic ecstasy Lou leans in towards the microphone
relishing the moment Her desperate and distorted scream
fills the hall The whites of Ruben’s eyes flash as if
igniting an erotic charge this glorious being merging with
him Sweat drips from Ruben’s hair and his eyes burn in an
endless climax or pain

SOUND OF METAL

INT AIRSTREAM - MORNING

We hear the slightest whistle of a breeze a squeak
subtle noises from the outside world as

Ruben sits up suddenly and looks around a small oddly shaped
room at the back end of an old Airstream trailer He looks
down at Lou as if expecting her to be gone She’s asleep and
immediately unrecognizable from her severe on-stage persona
He stares at her pale unmade face eyes closed he
imagines her dreams complex dark and rich with meaning
Ruben listensA leaf blower outside in the distance he
gets up

He pulls open the window curtain over a tiny dining table
The morning light blinds his eyes and illuminates the
interior of the AIRSTREAM This is the living kitchen
dining and war room of an obsessed audiophile Instruments
cords mixing boards reel-to-reel tape recorders mics all
tightly hung and fit into the tiny space Sound equipment
coexists with other items of kitsch collected over years of
nomadic living

Ruben peers out the window He looks for signs of danger
anything
INT AIRSTREAM - MORNING

The SOUND OF COFFEE DRIPPING AND GURGLING into a coffee pot

Ruben packs green vegetables and spices into a blender He
presses his hand down and the blender THRASHES LOUDLY

dining table

Lou

INT AIRSTREAM - MORNING

Ruben walks from the living room to the back of the
airstream He looks at Lou sleeping

RUBEN
Hey Lulu

No response Ruben stares He grabs a pair of drum sticks and
sits on the bed next to her With great focus he begins to

slowly drum a beat on the backs of covered thighs this
goes on for a minute before Lou groans sleepily the rhythm
picks up steam Ruben’s drumming and sound effects grow
louder and faster He’s in full drum solo now

LOU

Stop
He doesn’t stop

LOU (CONTD)

Stop it

RUBEN
Up time

LOU
No

Ruben looks at Lou still face down in bed He glances at her
scratching her arm aggressively in one raw spot Above this
spot we see the scars where once she cut herself

RUBEN
Hey stop that We got to get right

Ruben holds a smoothie He drinks it
RUBEN (CONTD)
Yo I got some smoothie for you

INT SILO CLUB - DAY

Ruben and Lou set up their funky version of a MERCH TABLE
Lou talks with ANOTHER MEMBER OF A BAND while Ruben sets out
various spray painted pieces of original art and a stack of
vinyl to sell Suddenly out of nowhere A RINGING SOUND
enters Ruben’s ears he tilts his head as if trying to
dislodge it Ruben stands frozen waiting for the sound to
abate It doesnt He looks at Lou She looks up at him and
smiles He looks away

INT SILO CLUB - STAGE - NIGHT

On stage Ruben slams away at his drums in deep concentration
as Lou screams torturously in the background We push toward
him as the RINGING SOUND again takes over and then gives way
to a LOW VIBRATIONAL THUMPING OF HIS DRUMS

INT AIRSTREAM - MORNING

MUFFLED QUIETNESS Ruben’s eyes open painfully The trace
of daylight coming through the closed curtain He turns
anxiously glancing at Lou’s peaceful face asleep on the
pillow He pulls himself out of bed very carefully so as
not to wake Lou and enters the bathroom he studies his
ears in the mirror almost expecting to find a bug or
creature hiding inside

He makes A NOISE IN HIS THROAT It registers in his ears as
DAMP AND MUFFLED

He COUGHS MUFFLED
INT AIRSTREAM - MOMENTS LATER

Ruben takes a quick shower lost in worry The SOUND OF
THE WATER is just barely audible

INT AIRSTREAM - MORNING

The MUFFLED SOUND OF COFFEE DRIPPING into a coffee pot

The MUFFLED SOUND OF A BLENDER

INT PARKING LOT - DAY

Lou watches the hood shut from the passenger seat She
studies Ruben wearing headphones as he makes his way to the
door and into the Airstream She notes his odd vacant
state he glances at her nervously as he starts the engine

at her and musters an incongruous smile

INT PHARMACY - AFTERNOON

Ruben frantically walks toward a pharmacy counter and waits
for the PHARMACIST to finish talking to someone
PHARMACIST
Can I help you find something

RUBEN
What

PHARMACIST
Can I help you

Ruben moves toward him He doesn’t want to talk for fear he’s
talking too loud He overcompensates by talking too softly

RUBEN
Um I’m having a funny thing with
my ears today

PHARMACIST
Pardon me

RUBEN
I’m having a problem with my ears

The pharmacist nods

PHARMACIST
And what’s going on

but not to worry A NURSE CALLS HIS NAME He doesnt hear
She taps him on the shoulder startling him

INT DOCTORS OFFICE - SOUND BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER

Ruben sits in a sound booth He is terribly nervous and
totally claustrophobic He drums his fingers on his pants
A DOCTOR enters the booth and helps him put headphones on He
leaves and shuts the door behind him Rubens breathing
increases Then he hears A LOUD VOICE

DOCTOR
You hear me in both ears

RUBEN
What

Ruben now has headphones on The doctor sits in the
foreground

DOCTOR
Okay we’re just going to get
started in your right ear okay

Ruben looks confused

DOCTOR (CONTD)
What I want is for you to repeat
the words back to me They’re going
to stay at this level I just want
the last word back okay

RUBEN
Sorry

DOCTOR
REPEAT THEM THE WORDS OKAY
JUST REPEAT THEM

Ruben nods
DOCTOR (CONTD)

nervous

-Cars

- Not sure

Ruben scratches his head

INT AUDIOLOGIST OFFICE - DAY

The doctor goes over to a shelf and takes out some headphones
and hands them to Ruben He gestures for Ruben to put them
on He does

DOCTOR
Can you hear me

The doctors voice is small tinny and distant as he speaks
into the microphone

RUBEN
Hear you Yeah kind of

Ruben presses his hands against the headphones to hear

DOCTOR
(loud and clear)
This music you play this is how
you make your living

RUBEN
Yes sir

DOCTOR
Okay that’s ah that’s an issue

Ruben stares shocked

DOCTOR (CONTD)
Is this particularly loud music
you’re playing

RUBEN
Loud

The doctor gets Rubens chart Looks it over and then holds
it up for Ruben

DOCTOR
These are your charts Ruben
Normal speech discrimination is 100
percent You were under 30 percent
in the right and 25 in the left
That meant that no matter how high
she turned up the volume you still
missed 70 to 80 percent of the
words That’s really ominous

RUBEN
What was that

DOCTOR
OMINOUS not good

RUBEN
Ah Okay So What’s the deal
How do I get it back
The doctor nods slowly

DOCTOR
Well-

RUBEN
I mean its normal or what

DOCTOR
No not at all normal Sudden
hearing loss is common enough by
itself and certainly with the sort
noise you’ve exposed yourself to it
needs to be considered but in your
case with both ears and this level
of severity we need to look toa
number of other possible causes as
well - can I ask do have any
hereditary auto immune issues in
your family that you’re aware of

Ruben’s confused

RUBEN
What I don’t know-

DOCTOR
How’s your parents health or
grandparents

Ruben stares intensely

RUBEN
Im sorry

DOCTOR
The reason I ask Ruben is that it
could help us determine whether
this might be a disease or not-

RUBEN
Huh

DOCTOR
Are you having any joint pain
lately

RUBEN

What In my ears

DOCTOR
Mr Davis I’m trying to help you
get to the bottom of this-

RUBEN
ITS NOT A DISEASE I just need to
figure our something uh- What can
you give me to help clear this out
a little
DOCTOR
I don’t follow

RUBEN
I mean is there a medication kind
of thing to put in my ear and clear
this out or what

DOCTOR

Right Ruben
(sighs)

I understand this is all quite
shocking for you but I need you to
understand something Whether this
is somehow a result of over
exposure to noise or it’s an
autoimmune issue your hearing is
deteriorating very rapidly Right

RUBEN
Well-

DOCTOR
And over the next days or even
hours it will likely get worse-

RUBEN
Dude I’m asking you what can I do

DOCTOR
First thing as a precaution is I
would absolutely eliminate exposure
to loud noises Then once we have
run some tests and identified
exactly what is going on with your
ears we can have some other
conversations-

RUBEN
What other conversations About
what

DOCTOR
Well in the event of permanent loss
there are procedures we can
discuss-

RUBEN
Like what What procedures

DOCTOR
Like for instance Cochlear
Implants-

RUBEN
What are those

DOCTOR
Cochlear implants

RUBEN
Yeah what are they They work

DOCTOR
They can be very effective for
people with severe hearing loss or
complete deafness yes-

RUBEN
Uh huh So let’s do that then

The doctor chuckles

DOCTOR
Well not so simple There are many
details and it’s quite costly

RUBEN
What

DOCTOR
(loudly)
EXPENSIVE

RUBEN
How much Like what general kind of
price

DOCTOR
Well they range between 40 and 80
thousand depending and
unfortunately they’re not covered
by insurance

Ruben nods slowly

RUBEN
Okay and when could this happen
Do you have them in stock

Ruben stares at the doctor

DOCTOR
Cochlear implants No Ruben that’s
a very involved process as well as
an invasive surgery But once we’ve
identified the issues we can have
that conversation Okay

(MORE )

DOCTOR (CONTD)
As I said before the one thing you
should be focused on right now is
protecting what hearing you have
left

Rubens stares lifelessly

HARD CUT

INT THE CELLAR ROOM STAGE - LATER

Red lights strobe on Ruben’s sweat ridden face as he crushes
his sticks against the drums He tries to hold on to an
impossibly thin thread of sound As we move closer into
Ruben’s eyes we see a deep well of hurt The strobing
lights continue illuminating flashes of Ruben’s face in
various poses of demonic ecstasy and pain The song builds
as Ruben hits harder and harder Suddenly the crackle of
sound breaks up Ruben’s no longer hearing Lou or his own
drums His drumming and Lou’s playing is suddenly out of
sync She looks back at him abruptly broken out of her
spell her eyes full of confusion Ruben panics He continues
to play in shock - staring hard at Lou trying desperately to
hold on to her rhythm and his place in the song his place in
the world She looks at him closely as she plays the final
chord Ruben glances at the crowd paranoid devastated in
his horrible emerging silence He stops playing puts down
his sticks Lou is shocked Ruben gets up and pushes his way
through the crowd down a hall up stairs and bursts out into
an ally no sound the world has gone silent He stares
terrified and alone his hands shake He whips around
feeling a hand on his shoulder Lou is standing there She
reacts immediately to his demeanor She speaks but Ruben
doesn’t hear

LOU (SILENT)
What the fuck What happened

Ruben stares at her voiceless screams unresponsive Lou
can see Rubens pain She is crying now

LOU (CONTD)
Rubi what’s happening What’s
wrong

Ruben looks at her total terror in his eyes he speaks but
can’t hear his own voice

RUBEN
I cant hear anything

INT DINER - NIGHT

Close up of coffee spinning in a mug Lou still in her
concert outfit looks at Ruben as he twirls his glass She
writes on a piece of paper with a shaky hand WILL IT COME
BACK And slides it to Ruben Ruben reads trying to act
calm

RUBEN
It will when I get surgery
There’s an implant thing The put
it in your shit It’s fine It’s
easy Forty grand or Eighty or
something so but yeah-

Ruben glances up to catch Lou’s freshly heartbroken face
tears running down her cheeks she tries to pull herself
together She stares at Ruben’s hand tapping nervously

RUBEN (CONTD)
We just gotta figure it out We’ll
play tomorrow night and see how it
goes I’ll just be like a click
track you can play to me-

Lou tries to speak-
RUBEN (CONTD)
Itll be different but it is what
it is
Lou stares at Ruben like he’s an alien

LOU
Um-No

She writes on a scrap of paper WE’RE NOT PLAYING ANYTHING
RUBEN Slides it to Ruben he reads

RUBEN
Yes we are playing We are

Lou puts up her hands as if to say “What are you talking
about”

RUBEN (CONTD)
Lou We have a fucking tour booked

LOU
No

RUBEN
YES ACTUALLY YES WE DO WE HAVE A
TOUR BOOKED
Lou looks anxiously at Ruben while at the same time massaging
a quickly building pain in her stomach Ruben pulls at his
hair unable to be in his skin He SEES A GUY outside smoking
a cigarette and he abruptly stands up from the table trying
to break himself out of his daze

RUBEN (CONTD)
Be back

Lou watches Ruben walk away with deep concern in her eyes
She picks at her food alone suppressing tears as she HEARS
RUBEN outside ASKING SOMEONE FOR A SMOKE

EXT DINER - MOMENTS LATER

Ruben takes the last sucks of a cigarette His hands shake
and his eyes dart around He flicks the cigarette before
heading back toward the diner

Lou looks at Ruben with frightened eyes Clearly scared
she gets up and goes around to his side of the booth and sits
right next to him She turns to him and takes his face and
kisses his cheek and then she crosses her arm through his and
she writes as Ruben watches in real time ANSWER TRUTHFULLY

ahead stiffly shaking his head slightly but doesn’t say

Implant

JOE

Expensive
(Rubbing two fingers
together )

RUBEN
Oh right Yeah well

Silence for a beat Ruben is getting increasingly antsy

JOE
So you should understand Ruben that
this is a Deaf community Not just
my program but were part of a
larger deaf community of working
Deaf adults and Deaf children from
all over And my program and those
in it benefit tremendously from
that Deaf community We work with
them and they work with us But
it’s very important if you want to
be here you understand that we’re
looking for a solution to this
(pointing at his
forehead )
Not this
(pointing to his ears)
(MORE )

JOE (CONTD)
In this community being Deaf is not
thought of as a problem that needs
to be fixed You understand

RUBEN
Okay Yeah okay cool

Ruben checks his phone again Joe thinks

JOE
Why dont you invite Lou to come in
here

EXT JOES HOUSE - DAY

Lou stands in the front of the house She stares at the
nothingness feeling very alone and terrified her moment is
interrupted by the sound of Rubens voice

RUBEN (0C)
Lou

EXT JOES HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Lou walks toward the wooden stairs leading up to Joes
office Ruben is at the top of the stairs holding the door
open

RUBEN
This guy wants to talk to you

LOU
Okay

IE JOES OFFICE - DAY
Lou and Ruben sit awkwardly

JOE
I think its important that you
stay here with us right now Ruben
Learn some sign language Find some
solid ground What do you think

RUBEN
Sounds great but we got no money
and-

JOE
Well sometimes our church sponsors
deaf people in need of help And
right now you fit the bill Ruben

Ruben rubs his face

RUBEN
Well honestly were not church
people so-

JOE
Ruben can you please

Joe gestures for Ruben to not cover his face

JOE (CONTD)
I read lips what did you say

RUBEN
Were not religious Either of us
Very much not into religion no
offense

JOE
Religion plays no part of this
Ruben The church helps PEOPLE in
need not just religious people
The most important thing is that
you want to be here If that’s in
place then I think we can find a
way

JOE (CONTD)

(turning to Lou)
Do you think Ruben needs help right
now Lou

Lou stares nods subtly

JOE (CONTD)
You understand that if Ruben was to
come here hed have to do it on
his own Members live in one house
together with no contact to the
outside world - no phones I’ve
found that in all cases thats the
way it works best Can you help
Ruben Commit to that Lou

Lou is shocked Ruben reads the screen agitated
Joe nods

RUBEN
We can just live in the RV We have
a house

JOE

Im sorry to say thats not the way
this works Ruben

RUBEN
Well thats a problem then

JOE
Is there anywhere you could be
during this time Lou

Lou is like a deer in the headlights Ruben stands

RUBEN
Thats that man

Ruben sticks his hand out and shakes Joes hand

RUBEN (CONTD)
Cheers dude Thanks for your time

Joe stands

JOE
Its nice to meet you Ruben

Ruben nods and exits Joe opens the door for Lou and follows
her down the stairs She and Joe get to the bottom of the
stairs as Ruben is already around the corner Lou turns to

Joe

LOU
So thanks But can you tell us
anything about the surgery thing I
think thats our main concern right
now

JOE
Cochlear implant surgery

LOU
I know its expensive but I thought
maybe you could point us in the
right direction so we can get
everything going as fast as
possible

JOE
The surgery is not a fast process
Lou Its brain surgery It takes
months So either way Ruben will
not be hearing for some time Its
important you understand this He
needs real support now and focusing
on the surgery is actually not
going to help him In fact it could
be very destructive

LOU
Oh really

Joe nods with certainty

LOU (CONTD)
Ok well-

JOE
This must not be so easy for you
either It seems like maybe you
could use some support too

Lou nods

JOE (CONTD)
Do you have anywhere you could go
find some help if Ruben came here

Lou takes her hand off her stomach trying to stay strong

LOU
Well Im fine but its just I
dont know-

JOE
Sometimes people wont get help for
themselves until they know people
they love are going to be okay

LOU
Okay Yeah Thanks-

JOE
So if you have anywhere at all to
land consider doing that for
Rubens sake

Lou nods

LOU
Okay
JOE
And Lou dont hesitate on this
Pull the bandaid off quick Itll
hurt a lot less than the
alternative

to another white board with a graph and everyones name on

named and hes the only one who doesnt know it

dinner as an animated conversation progresses to a fever
pitch between DAN and a red faced Jenn She signs lightning
fast her signing becomes more and more crude as the moment
progresses Joe slams the table adding something to the
conversation Jenn shrugs as if to say “What’s the problem”
Jenn looks at Ruben knowing hes catching none of the
conversation She types something into her tablet and big
bold words scroll across the screen “DANS A PUSSY” We stay

I wonder Ruben during these
mornings when you have been sitting
in my study-

Sitting I wonder if youve had any
moments of stillness

Ruben stares at the words on the screen

JOE (ASL - SPOKEN)
Because youre right Ruben the
world does keep moving and it can
be a damn cruel place But for
me that place of stillness that
comes when Im not clamoring or
running or desperately clutching
the moments where this crappy
mundane world suddenly becomes
radiant and magnificent and all
fear is gone for me THAT PLACE
is the kingdom of God nota
church or heaven or any particular

religion THAT PLACE inside
you that is where god lives
Ruben

Ruben looks away from the screen to Joe who is staring deep
in his eyes

JOE (ASL - SPOKEN) (CONTD)
And that place will never abandon
you never pass you by When all is
lost itll still be there for you
I assure you

Ruben nods as his foot shakes up and down

Joe stares

JOE (ASL - SPOKEN)
Okay

RUBEN (ASL - SPOKEN)

JOE (ASL - SPOKEN)
Ruben as you know everyone here
shares in the belief that being
deaf is not a handicap Not
something to fix That’s pretty
important around here All of these
kids all of us need to be reminded
of it every day

Ruben shifts in agitation

RUBEN (ASL - SPOKEN)
I understand-

JOE (ASL - SPOKEN)
And my house is a house built on
that belief and built on trust And
when that trust is violated things
happen like what happened to Jenn
Right

Ruben stares at Joe Knows he knows

JOE (CONTD)

too many others to consider

Ruben feels a pit in his stomach He looks at Joe with
feigned resilience

RUBEN

touches the device around his ear as if maybe the sound will
suddenly clear and turn into what he remembers

AUDIOLOGIST (CONTD)
How does it sound

RUBEN
Um it’s weird

Ruben does not like the sound of his own voice It is loud
and tinny he tries to suppress his panic the doctor
adjust the frequency The sound changes but its still
oppressive

AUDIOLOGIST
Hows that

Ruben is shell shocked

RUBEN
Ah sounds bad

AUDIOLOGIST
As I’m sure you know Ruben this is
not sound like you remember What
youre hearing is actually a
digital signal being received by a
metal device in your head and it’s
sort of tricking your brain into
thinking that you are actually
hearing But in reality your ears
aren’t working still It’s the
implant inside your head that is
creating the sensation of sound
That’s the sound you’re hearing

RUBEN
Okay

You gotta give it some time okay I

would suggest you take it easy in

RUBEN
Yes I know about that

RICHARD
She took Louise when she left me
and she took her again when she
killed herself

Richard stares at Ruben

RICHARD (CONTD)
Louise should have come back here
then but she was hating me so what
could I do
(long sigh)
But you you gave her a place to
go at this time

Richard is suddenly surprisingly emotional-

RICHARD (CONTD)
This is very good I did not like
you so much then but now I thank
you I want to say you this okay

Ruben stares

RICHARD (CONTD)
But anyhow I think you will be
happy to see her doing so well
That is what is important right

Richard chews on another piece of bread

RICHARD (CONTD)
No

RUBEN
Of course

RICHARD
Ok good

INT LOUS BEDROOM - DAY

Ruben closes the door of a large bedroom This is Lou’s room
Stuff is piled everywhere in typical Lou fashion Some
musical equipment Books Next to Lou’s bed is a photo of
Ruben in front of the Airstream Ruben picks up a pile of
photos from a stack of stuff in the corner of the room He
looks through a series of shots of Lou as a young girl with
her very beautiful once was actress mother - presumably
taken by Richard on a beach her mother topless
flirting with the camera Lou withdrawn even then
Underneath these photos is a stack of magazines highlighting
Lou’s mother at the height of her stardom in various highly
sexual poses - some with a much younger cooler Richard
Ruben closes the shutters over Lou’s bed muffling the sound
of the street below He climbs into bed

INT LOUS BEDROOM - EVENING

From Ruben’s POV he wakes in a daze to the SOUND of shutters
opening letting the last blue light of the day into the
room Ruben turns over sees Lou Ruben can barely
recognize her She looks vibrant and strong

RUBEN
Whoa

Lou turns toward him grins warmly but uncomfortably taking
in all of her lost friend

LOU
Hi Can you hear me

Ruben sits up feedback slamming his ears as she latches the
shudders

RUBEN
Yeah Loud and clear
Look at you Lulu

She turns toward him

LOU
What

RUBEN
You look different

Ruben looks at her arm

RUBEN (CONTD)
No scratching

LOU
Oh yeah-

RUBEN
Thats good

Ruben gets up and give Lou a hug his ears buzzing with the
noise

INT LOUS BEDROOM - LATER

Lou sits next to Ruben on the bed rubs her finger over the
bump on Ruben’s head and then puts his implant on feeling
the magnet engage with his skin

LOU
Does it feel weird

RUBEN
Not really

LOU
So crazy Howd you do it Rubi

RUBEN
Oh I just I worked some magic
I have to talk to you about it

RICHARDS VOICE CAN BE HEARD CALLING FOR LOU FROM DOWNSTAIRS

RICHARD (0S)

Lou pulls herself up suddenly - little manic

LOU

LOU

RUBEN

INT RICHARD’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ruben walks through the apartment toward the sounds of a
stereo blasting frenetic 60s jazz seeshears people
preparing food clattering in the kitchen loudly in
French he peaks around the corner to the front door Lou
is laughing with some guests arriving She sees Ruben and
smiles at him holding up a “gimme a sec” finger

INT RICHARDS APARTMENT - LATER

More guests the stereo continues playing but now three
times louder than before this is a very entrenched scene
filled with musicians and artists Ruben might as well be
deaf even as his head is PUMMELED WITH SOUND He SEES Lou
out in the yard AMONGST A GOOD LOOKING GROUP OF PEOPLE She
is genuinely happy to see him coming over She says something
to the others but for Ruben its just a digital and confusing
mess of sounds Someone says something to him but he cant
understand

LOU
Did you get something to eat

RUBEN
What

Lou leans toward him

LOU
Did you get something to eat

Ruben nods unsure of what she said

EXT RICHARD’S APARTMENT - EVENING

Ruben stands by himself just trying to get through it Lou
steals a glance at him from afar

INT RICHARDS APARTMENT - EVENING

The sounds are more intense now as people continue to drink
The harsh sound of a fork hitting a glass-

Now we break out of Rubens perspective and Richard finishes
hitting his glass The room quiets

RICHARD (FRENCH SUBTITLED)
I would like to ask my daughter to
join me for a song

LOU
Papa no-

RICHARD (FRENCH SUBTITLED)
Come Louise It is my birthday Is
that fair

The crowd likes the idea Lou does not Ruben watches her
unsure what is happening Lou concedes walks up to her
father to much applause
Ruben watches her but she doesn’t look at him She stands
next to her father Richard whispers something in Lous ear
Lou flushes nods - sits at the piano

RICHARD (FRENCH SUBTITLED) (CONTD)
Some of you here knew Louises
mother And you know I wrote many
songs for her This one was
Louises favorite
(looks at Louise)
You remember

Lou nods Richard sits at the piano Ruben stares at Lou
standing awkwardly behind him Richard begins to play the
piano and smiles warmly at Lou and nods Lou sings in French
her voice pure and simple Richard joins her his once smooth
crooning voice is now a scratchy grumble but it mixes with
Lous voice surprisingly well The words theyre singing
together clearly have great meaning to both of them Lou
doesn’t look at Ruben as she sings but Ruben stares deep into
her eyes There is no mistaking her connection to the
experience and her father’s world around her Through Ruben’s
digital ears Lou and Richard are a beautiful fractured
tragedy of sound The song ends and there is a beat of
silence before the applause the sound shattering Ruben’s
ears Lou looks away

INT LOUS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Ruben sits on the bed and glances at Lou as she gets ready to
join him Her movements are awkward She comes to the bed and
sits She turns to Ruben maybe for the first time since she
sang She reaches out and sweetly rubs his ear - Ruben
ignores the loud scratchy sound He pulls her toward him and
kisses her The kissing intensifies between them and then Lou
pulls back and reaches for her glass

LOU
Sorry I need water

RUBEN
You okay
LOU
Yeah Its just really dry in here
Lou drinks puts the glass down and slips back into place
next to Ruben she fondles his ear gently

LOU (CONTD)

Ruben looks at Lou She looks radiant She looks away

LOU

RUBEN

do that-

LOU
Barely I had mostly forgotten But

Beat Ruben looks around at the room

RUBEN
You remember this place at all

LOU
Now I do Yeah- Its disconcerting
some of the things we hold onto in
our memory without knowing were
holding onto it

Lou looks off with a very sad look in her eye

LOU (CONTD)
Just I dont know We never talked
about it ever

(MORE )

LOU (CONTD)
So this place was just a weird
dreamy idea But some things have
come back now

Lou looks at Ruben

LOU (CONTD)
I told everyone about our little
gypsy life

Ruben keeps looking away

LOU (CONTD)
I miss it

RUBEN

LOU

RUBEN
Uh huh yeah we gotta get back in

groove I have to get back and get

Ruben gulps cant get him self to bring up the money

RUBEN (CONTD)
Just I dont know Got a lot to
do

LOU
You mean with the tour

RUBEN
The tour everything We gotta
get on it

Ruben looks down When he looks up Lou is looking away He
notices her scratching her arm in the spot she used to
scratch He stares at her fingernail grinding into her skin
He looks at her face and at the picture of them together in
front of the airstream Lou like a different person then
Rubens eyes take in the truth of Lou now She cant go back
with him And he cant stay The revelation is devastating

He sits with it then reaches out and stops her hand from
scratching Lou doesnt look up for a moment Then she does

RUBEN (CONTD)
Its okay Lulu

Lou stares at Ruben a crushing sadness coming over her

LOU
What

RUBEN
Its okay

LOU

Whats okay

Ruben stares at her and nods hardly believing the truth he
suddenly knows He stares

LOU (CONTD)
What

RUBEN
You saved my life and you made it
beautiful
Lou hears this like a gunshot

LOU
What are you saying

She looks at Ruben sees an emotion in him shes never seen
He covers his face shaking

LOU (CONTD)
You saved my life too Rubi

She puts a hand on him and they wrap themselves around each
other holding tight

INT LOUS BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Ruben glances down at Lou asleep in bed in the blue light of
early morning Paris He quietly pulls a shirt on He looks at
Lou again for one last moment

EXT RICHARD’S APARTMENT - MORNING

Ruben opens the door to the street and steps out with his
bag Even the early morning street noise hits his brain hard

EXT PARIS - MOMENTS LATER

Now Paris is awake and loud as Ruben walks through it The
sound kills his head

EXT PARIS STREET - LATER

Ruben sits on a bench in front of a cathedral square as the
sounds of tourists flocking pigeons children coalesce ina
crazy horrible cacophony Then to add to the chorus the
church bells start ringing Their clanging slams at Ruben’s
brain The world around him is a crazy chaotic mess His
first impulse is rage He reaches up and removes the devices
from his ears Everything goes instantly silent He breathes
The morning sun breaks over the slate on the steeple He
breathes again something shifts his eyes fall over the many
moments around him no longer abrasive they each have a
singular silent beauty He looks up at the church bells as
they swing silently back and forth
