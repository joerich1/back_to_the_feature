EXT STARSCAPE - NIGHT

The NIGHT SKY speckled with STARS But look closely
and -- one of the stars is SHOOTING

EXT SOUTH LONDON SKYLINE - EVENING

Miles beneath the South London SKYLINE TOWER BLOCKS
line the horizon like broken teeth

FIREWORKS crackle and bloom in the distance Must be
early November Fireworks Night

Lower still a teeming scrum of COMMUTERS and VEHICLES
around an UNDERGROUND STATION

EXT UNDERGROUND STATION - EVENING

SAM mid 20s emerges from the crowd Pretty brightly
dressed amongst the grey commuters She takes out her
mobile lifts it to her ear and begins to walk

SAM
Hey mum

EXT BUSY HIGH STREET —- MOMENTS LATER
We follow SAM’S face amongst a crowd of pedestrians

SAM
--Sorry I couldn’t call sooner
I haven’t had a chance it’s
been crazy

Little kids run past waving SPARKLERS
Now SAM walks through a bustling market street
SAM

no I’m just walking back to
the flat my shift ran over

EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Now she walks down a street of stuccoed Georgian
houses KIDS run past with sparklers families in tow

SAM crosses the road We cut to a HIGH WIDE SAM’S a
lonely figure walking in a different direction to
everyone else

EXT ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
SAM cuts down an alley

SAM
--what about next weekend I
could take the train up and stay
the night

As SAM walks on we TRACK IN towards five names
graffitied on the wall A FIREWORK BOOMS and FLASHES
throwing two HOODED SHADOWS onto the wall

SAM JUMPS She turns and just GLIMPSES two HOODED
FIGURES on BIKES dart into the shadows

EXT WALLED STREET - NIGHT

CLOSE ON SAM’S FEET as she strides her pace has
quickened

SAM
---I’11 call you on Sunday we
can make a plan

She turns into MOSTYN ROAD

SAM (CONTD)
1’d better ring off now
speak soon bye

She looks ahead sees a GANG of KIDS watching her from
some distance

SAM (CONT’D)
--Okay bye

EXT LOW RISE COUNCIL HOUSES - MOMENTS LATER

There are no other pedestrians anymore The street
lights are weak orange The air is moist misty

SAM
(irritated)
I’ve been up for fifteen
hours mum I’m too tired to have
this conversation
Attack The Block - FINAL SCRIPT (Inc Reshoots) 101110 3

The two HOODED KIDS speed past her on BIKES one of
them (YOUTH 2’s) a ridiculously tiny child’s size

A BANGER EXPLODES in their wake SAM JUMPS

EXT SIDE ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

This road is deserted too GARAGES on one side Blank
wall on the other A shaggy-haired young man bops past
(BREWIS) listening to music heading the other way

SAM
-and millions of people live
here their whole lives and
nothing bad ever happens to
them Jesus stop worrying

Booming BASS vibrates the air A BMW Coupé with blacked-
out windows carries us around a corner

EXT ROAD BESIDE PARK - MOMENTS LATER

PARKED CARS line one side of this street patchily lit
open PARKLAND the other

SAM
(hurrying)
--gotta go now mum

About thirty meters ahead silhouetted by street light
we see FIVE HOODED YOUTHS including the BIKE BOYS

SAM

(distracted)
-alright I’1ll call you as
soon as I get in the door

SAMS pace SLOWS She eyes them warily She walks into
the road making for the other pavement

SAM
--bye

She tucks her PHONE in her HANDBAG Ahead the GANG
watch exchanging unheard comments conferring

SAM hugs her HANDBAG close She walks forward playing
it cool Then

The two BIKE BOYS split from the group and pedal lazily
towards her SAM steels herself slows

They pass VERY CLOSE Their HOODS are up their faces
masked they loom at her like spectres --
Attack The Block - FINAL SCRIPT (Inc Reshoots) 101110 4

-- but pass right by SAM walks on relieved Too soon
Because now the remaining YOUTHS ahead stroll out into
the street in front of her

SAM
(under her breath)
Fuck

They form a ramshackle line across her path Anonymous
nonchalant menacing

SAM stops Afraid It’s a stand-off Nobody says
anything The silhouetted YOUTHS exchange whispers

YOUTHS
(whispered)
--set the pace set the pace

The dominant youth (YOUTH 1) walks towards her She
turns around Behind her the two BIKE BOYS straddle
their rides lazily blocking her exit

When she turns back SHOCK YOUTH1 is RIGHT THERE

YOUTH 1
(fast aggressive)
Gimme the phone gimme the
phone gimme the phone

Only his EYES are visible between hood and bandana
like some ghoulish highway robber SAM fumbles in her
bag face pale with fear Gives him her PHONE

YOUTH 1
The money the purse gimme the
purse give it me

SAM delves into her bag again with trembling hands
Impatient the youth GRABS the whole bag

SAM
Hey

YOUTH 1

He throws the bag behind him Another YOUTH catches it
forages inside SAM lifts her hands defensively --

SAM

-- inadvertently revealing an ANTIQUE RING on her
finger The lead youth SEES IT

YOUTH 1

Attack The Block - FINAL SCRIPT (Inc Reshoots) 101110 5

SAM

He pulls something from his pocket It CLICKS and
FLASHES into view

A KNIFE

SAM starts to pull the ring off It’s tight She
struggles The YOUTH steps closer

YOUTH 1

Impatient he grabs her hand There’s a small STRUGGLE
between them SAM shoves him away

SAM

The GANG close around her

SAM pulls off the ring holds it out

SAM

YOUTH 2 snatches it but the GANG make no move to
leave SAM begins to panic She SCREAMS OUT

SAM
Help Somebody help me

At that moment high above she sees something that
makes her FREEZE

A BRILLIANT BALL OF LIGHT Plummeting through the sky
right behind the gang A firework

Attack The Block - FINAL SCRIPT (Inc Reshoots) 101110 6

The GANG are BACKLIT by a powerful ethereal LIGHT As
one they turn and look upwards then start to RUN

As they RUN -- BOOM Whatever it is it IMPACTS the
roof of the nearest parked car a silver Volvo S60

The roof CAVES instantly The windows EXPLODE OUT The
GANG are thrown to the tarmac by the SHOCK WAVE

Silence SHATTERED GLASS settles SMOKE billows and
clears from the WRECKED CAR

SAM sits up stunned Looks at the CAR Looks at the
recovering GANG Then she stands up and STUMBLE-RUNS
AWAY We stay with the gang

YOUTH 3

YOUTH 5
Fam she’s ghostin’

The closest YOUTHS watch her gobut the LEAD YOUTH’S

Authoritative His namevis MOSES

nervously keeping their distance as --

smoky murky darkness

He reaches his hand in finds the HANDLE to open the
door It’s buckled Broken

He reaches DEEPER in fiddles for the GLOVE
COMPARTMENT Opens it
Attack The Block - FINAL SCRIPT (Inc Reshoots) 101110 7

A little LIGHT comes on immediately illuminating
something in the foot-well

A small pale monstrous FACE

Whatever it is it HISSES in terror MOSES snaps away
his hand

MOSES (CONTD)
Shiiit There’s something in

He’s interrupted by a startling SHRIEK from behind He
turns just as -- something JUMPS OUT AT HIM

The following happens too FAST to see much detail

A CREATURE the size of a small child skinny and pale
Razor sharp jet-black TEETH flash

It wraps itself around MOSES who falls backwards to
the ground

A furious STRUGGLE Claws SWIPE Three bloody stripes
are SLASHED across MOSES’ cheek Everyone YELLS

MOSES’ KNIFE FLASHES in the air as he STABS at the
CREATURE’S flank It emits an ear-piercing SHRIEK

MOSES grabs it and FLINGS it away

It rolls scuttles across the pavement then LOLLOPS
into the gloomMOSES climbs to his feet Fury boils in
his eyes as the others fuss around him

YOUTH 5

YOUTH 4
Some orangutan type thing I’m

Beneath the stars the ESTATE A wide twenty storey
TOWER BLOCK surrounded by a ring of LOW RISES All
connected by intersecting elevated WALKWAYS

towards a red arrow labelled ‘YOU ARE HERE’

tassles The one who pushed me
over the main one he had a red
baseball cap That’s all I can

them

SAM

enough to stay hanging around

OFFICER 2
It’s not the brightest of kids
do this kind of thing And we
can drop you with a friend or a
relative after if you don’t want
to come back to an empty flat

PURPLE LIGHT emanate from inside RON leads MOSES
inside letting the door BOOM shut behind them

INT RON’S FLAT WEED ROOM - NIGHT
RON leads MOSESinto a room where the windows are

BOARDED UP with METAL GRATES and the walls are lined
with FOIL

There are scores of CANNABIS PLANTS on folding tables
A jerry-rigged SPRINKLER SYSTEM HEATERS The only
light is PURPLE UV Loud HIP HOP BOOMS

Two men TONKS and HI-HATZ stand with their backs to
us busying themselves at a table across the room

Momentarily we see that the back of MOSES’ hoodie is
splattered with a substance that GLOWS in the UV light
Then RON turns on the main lights The glow vanishes

RON
(seeing Moses)
Hi-Hatz
RON nods towards MOSES

HI-HATZ turns around He’s short but wears a baseball
cap on top of an elevated afro to compensate

HI-HATZ

TONKS takes the CARCASS from MOSES crosses the room
and sits it on the table beside HI-HATZ

HI-HATZ considers the carcass Then he takes off his
sunglasses and puts them on its nose He LAUGHS
lifting its chin so everyone can see his handiwork
TONKS and RON force laughter MOSES doesn’t

HI-HATZ releases the carcass and wipes his hand on his
jacket His smile suddenly drops
