Clarkson grabs a file and speaks without looking back

CLARKSON
Seems we have two stabbings one
shooting and a man with a broken leg and
a bad hangover who cant remember what
happened Average night back in
Brighton

The cops stare at him lost As they file into a SMALL ROOM
filled with tightly drawn curtains They all squeeze into the

center together Kathy is pressed against the large cop

Clarkson pulls back a curtain revealing
ZLATA SEHIK 40 Muslim Her face is covered with wounds She
avoids the gaze of the police who stare with contempt She
pulls her bed-sheet up to her chin as

CLARKSON (CONTD)
(reading chart) facial contusions from
repeated beatings with fist
lacerations on the eye caused by the
edge of an iron

He pauses Looking at Zlata he moves her sheet up to expose
her leg Zlatas eyes tear Clarkson reads

The right hand was the first entry point
of a large kitchen knife The second
entry point in the upper left thigh
It went through her hand and into her
leg Whos going to take this report

ground One cop peeks into the next cubicle Kathy looks at
Clarkson for a cue He holds out the clipboard

to her group but they have even less respect for her She
goes to speak when VIKO 25 looks up hesitant
