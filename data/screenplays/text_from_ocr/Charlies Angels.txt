CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899

FADE IN

EXT THE BIG BLUE SKY - DAY
A VIRGIN AIR 747 bursts through the clouds and levels off
INT VIRGIN AIR 747 - DAY

We move through the FIRST CLASS CABIN Its the regular
mix of first class people OLD MONEY in Gucci enjoying
freshly baked cookies a MILLIONAIRE in jeans and a T-
shirt BUSINESS PEOPLE relaxing after a tough day and

a very nervous MAN

Shifty-eyed Alone in an aisle seat the emergency row
We hold on him for a moment but not for too long Then
we continue moving into --

THE COACH SECTION

Stopping at the lavatory the OCCUPIED sign switches to
VACANT and

JAMES EARL JONES

(or actually a James Earl Jones type who for ease of
description well simply refer to as James Earl Jones)
steps out of the restroom in full African regalia
multi-colored dashiki mufti (its a kind of hat) the
works He heads up the aisle towards --
THE FIRST CLASS CABIN
Where he is stopped by a --

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Im sorry sir This cabin is
restricted to first cl

Mr Jones now removes a FIRST CLASS TICKET

JAMES EARL JONES
Is this what youre looking for

She looks at it -- a little confused as to why hes just
handing it to her now -- but then she nods As he passes

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Oh Im sorry Please Is there
anything I can get you

JAMES EARL JONES
Scotch blended Straight

He continues into the first class cabin and toward --
CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 2
THE FIRST CLASS EMERGENCY ROOM

Where he slides in past the nervous shifty-eyed man (his
name is PASQUAL) and sits by the window

After a moment Pasqual quietly clears his throat and
leans slightly towards Jones

PASQUAL
(tentatively)
They say birds cant fly this high

JAMES EARL JONES
They say only angels can

Now Pasqual nods Nervously begins to remove something
from his pocket when they are interrupted by --

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Shall I pour your scotch

JAMES EARL JONES
No -- Ill take the bottle Thank you

She hands him the airplane-sized bottle -- he waves off
the glass She shrugs leaving

Pasqual to resume what he was doing Slowly he removes
a roll of Certs He looks to Jones -- Well What about
your end of the bargain

From within his dashiki Jones pulls out a black velvet
pouch He hands it to Pasqual who opens it to find
diamonds A helluva lot of diamonds Pasqual smiles

He hands the roll of Certs to Jones Its not breath
candy at all but a tiny roll of explosives with a tiny
high-tech triggering mechanism

JAMES EARL JONES
Ah c-5 The most dangerous
explosive material ever invented
Hard to believe that this little
contraption could blow up ten city
blocks

PASQUAL
Be careful with it huh

Both men smile Pasquals very relieved that the deal is
done

Then suddenly the lights blink out
Pasqual looks around nervous But its just the in-

flight movie beginning Clouds and a woman holding a
torch

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 3

Columbia Pictures presents David Spade and Adam

Sandler in BOSOM BUDDIES THE MOVIE
James Earl Jones shakes his head rolls his eyes

JAMES EARL JONES
Another movie from an old TV show

PASQUAL
Well whatre you gonna do

JAMES EARL JONES
Walk out
PASQUAL
Thats very funny

But James Earl Jones is dead serious

JAMES EARL JONES
No It isnt

Jones grabs Pascal in a headlock and turns toward the
back of the plane shouting

JAMES EARL JONES (CONTD)
EVERYONE FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS

Now Jones does the unthinkable Holding Pasqual tight
he yanks open the emergency door release

With a RUSH the cabin decompresses

Panic erupts as air paper and everything not belted in
screams out of the open door including --

EXT THE BIG BLUE SKY - FALLING AWAY FROM THE 747 - DAY

-- James Earl Jones still holding Pasqual in a bear hug
They plummet wind violently tearing at them Pasquals
frantic SCREAMS doppler quite nicely

DROPPING WITH THEM

They continue to fall gaining speed Pasqual is
terrified but Jones doesnt seem worried In fact
casually he glances at his watch and then looks --

FAR BELOW THEM - ACROSS THE SKY

At the tiny black speck gradually grows larger in the
distance

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 4
CLOSER - ON THAT BLACK SPECK

Its a jet helicopter Its door opens and now a SKYDIVER leaps
out helmet down arms back streaking across the

sky in aerodynamic perfection heading directly towards

JONES AND PASQUAL

who are still plummeting toward the earth at terminal

velocity Jones begins to let go of Pasqual who SCREAMS
and tries to clutch onto him desperate
JAMES EARL JONES
(over the rushing wind)
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER WE HAVE

COMPANY
PASQUAL
WHAT
Suddenly -- WHOMMPPPH -- the skydiver spread-eagles

stopping the wild dive directly behind Pasqual and
immediately binds his arms and straps a parachute on him

All three are still free-falling

James Earl Jones nods at the Skydiver who even under the
helmet and goggles is clearly a beautiful woman

Meet ALEXANDRA ALEX MUNDAY one of Charlies Angels
Shes a sultry bombshell -- a classic femme fatale --
only shes playing for the good guys

She gives James Earl Jones a wink then jerks Pasquals
rip cord and -- WHOOMPH Pasquals chute deploys He

flies upward leaving --

Alex and James Earl Jones both still falling Below the
ocean screams up at them Not much time left

James Earl Jones pulls his belt -- and his mufti flies
up Its actually a tiny drogue chute deploying his

entire dashiki His outfit hides a parachute rig

Alex pulls her own rip cord and -- WHOOMPH -- her chute
unfurls and now

Alex and James Earl Jones gently float towards --

EXT THE BIG BLUE SEA - DAY

A cigarette boat floats through the choppy water a
gorgeous young woman expertly throttling up the growling

v-8

Say hello to NATALIE THOMPSON Charlies second angel
At a glance shes the brainy-shy girl next door

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 5

But put her behind the wheel of any vehicle and shes
unstoppable

Natalie glances ahead maneuvering the boat perfectly under
Alex who drops on deck Alex gathers her chute then whips off
her helmet to give her cascading mane a wild shake

Here comes James Earl Jones Natalie guns the boat
underneatha perfect catch Alex helps him with his
dashiki-chute and then all three look up

Here comes Pasqual Natalie whips the boat around
catching him as he helplessly drops into the seats still
bound still scared out of his wits He gapes wild-eyed
at the two Angels then whirls on James Earl Jones

PASQUAL
You crazy bastard

JAMES EARL JONES
I think you mean crazy bitch

With that James Earl Jones reaches up and pulls his face
off Latex rips free and standing there (without his
dashiki James Earl Jones has a great figure) is

stunningly beautiful DYLAN SANDERS angel number
three Shes the wild one

Pasquals jaw drops as Dylan shakes her hair free then
reaches in her mouth --

DYLAN
(still with James Earl Jones voice)
Dont need this anymore

-- and extracts a voice-modifying chip
DYLAN (CONTD)
(now in her real voice)

But I sure could use this

And she pulls from her pocket the airplane-size bottle of
Johnnie Walker Black She twists it open and downs it

DYLAN (CONTD)
Damn I hate to fly

EXT BEACH DOCK - DAY

Now MEN IN FBI WINDBREAKERS haul Pasqual away two of
them carefully handling the certs-explosive A harmless
fellow pushes his way past them and onto the dock

Its JOHN BOSLEY Charlies lieutenant

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 6

He reaches the boat which Natalie ties off while Alex
and Dylan neatly fold their parachutes

BOSLEY
Well Angels the experimental
explosives are back in the hands of
the government and the free world
can breathe just a lit-tle bit
easier tonight thanks to you three

Alex Natalie and Dylan stroll from the dock onto the sand
each starting to unzipunbuttonunsnap their action gear and
hand it to Bosley as they continue walking

NATALIE
And thanks to you too Bos

ALEX
We couldnt have redirected the
flight path without your help

Bosley puffs proud He speaks over the ever-growing
pile of chutes body suits goggles the dashiki

BOSLEY
Nothing a little teamwork cant do
At least thats what Charlies
always telling us right ladies

DYLAN
Charlie will be joining us wont he

BOSLEY
He sends his regrets But he
wanted you to know that dinner is
on him so feel free to celebrate

By now the Angels have stripped off all of their
equipment revealing eye-popping evening gowns

ALEX
If its on Charlie we will
The Angels share a laugh as they arrive in their sassy
duds at a private beach club where a WAITER greets them
with a tray of champagne flutes

They each take a glass turn to each other and raise
them Another Angels Mystery Case Closed

INT MENS STEAM ROOM - DAY

A burst of steam clears revealing Bosley He waddles forward
in his shower clogs which SQUISH with every step Hes wearing
two towels one around his waist and a second around his
chest

As more steam dissipates we see there are SEVEN MEN sitting on
the risers Six are gorgeous ranging from Calvin Klein models
to Marlboro Men Bosley looks around taking a keen interest
Maybe hes checking them out maybe he isnt We just dont
know

The seventh man is ROGER CORWIN who we recognize from
the videotape Hes leaning forward a gold chain
dangling Its beside him that Bosley takes a seat

He sets the ice cup -- and the transmitter -- in a
strategic location

Noticing that none of the other men have towels around

their bosoms Bosley nervously undoes his revealing skin

the color of cooked salmon He fluffs up his sparse chest hair
then decides to smush it back down
He tries to make eye contact with Corwin working way too
hard Annoyed Corwin finally looks over

BOSLEY
Hot in here isnt it

Corwin shakes his head idiot

BOSLEY (CONTD)
Just came here to unwind a little
Business these days is go go go My
company just held an initial pubic offering

Yes he said pubic Hes about to correct himself when

a very hot guy across from him moves his towel to wipe off

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 19

some sweat We dont see the promised land but Bosley
does It flusters him

He sees another guy eating ice chips Good idea Bosley
does the same He eats another And another

BOSLEY (CONTD)
(xre-composed)
So what business are you in

Corwin seems wary but Bosley is clearly harmless

CORWIN
Computers Software

BOSLEY
Computers hunh What do you know
about this new browser from Knox
Technologies

Corwin bristles at the mention

BOSLEY (CONTD)
Word on the street is once they
raise capital theyll rule the
industry

CORWIN
I dont see that happening

BOSLEY
Really Why not

The door opens a rush of steam ADONIS HIMSELF enters
Picking a seat behind Bosley he pulls off his towel as
he passes We just see a bit of ass but Bosley is face-
to-face with the babymaker

One ice chip is not going to do it He chugs the rest of
his cup including

THE TRANSMITTER

which BLEEPS Corwin and others look over What the hell
was that

The device still in his mouth Bosley has no choice but to
smile and swallow His eyes go wide as he chokes it down

something undeniably sensual about the whole experience

ALEX

NATALIE

Natalie comes back a little annoyed Dylan takes a
glass for herself then foists the other glasses on
everyone around her whether they wanted it or not

DYLAN (CONTD)

She nudges Natalie in that direction

ON DYLAN

She smiles hearing the deal close Pushing through a
cluster of investors she bumps into a THIN MAN

DYLAN
Pardon me

He doesnt respond but something about this man raises
her suspicions Where has she seen him before As he

moves out of earshot

DYLAN (CONTD)
Natalie Nine oclock Thin man

Spotting the Thin Man she heads his way

NATALIE
(offering)
Vegetarian spring roll

He waves her away no Oops she drops a napkin in front
of him She kneels down to get it

As we move in VERY CLOSE ON her tray we see that theres
a tiny Digital display A metal detector is built into
the rim

It BLIPS as she moves past his ankle And again as she
rises up past his chest The man just keeps walking

NATALIE (CONTD)

INT HALLWAY - DAY
The Thin Man is headed down the hall Looking back we
see Dylan enter from the ballroom
( )
CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 27

DYLAN
Excuse me

He doesnt turn back
DYLAN (CONTD)
Excuse me do you know which way
the ladies room is

The man takes a sudden right into a service hallway

DYLAN (CONTD)
Why do they always run
She slips off her heels to give chase
INT SERVICE HALLWAY - DAY

The Thin Man comes around the corner We stay TIGHT on
him until he suddenly stops

NATALIE

has come around from the other side His bad guy instincts
tell him these women are working together Hes boxed in

And then a DING

Elevator doors open beside him He looks in to see the clue-
less BELLBOY who had a funky groove going on his headphones
In a single motion the Thin Man yanks the guy out into the
hallway and takes his place Hits the button

From opposite directions Natalie and Dylan run to the
elevator but the doors have already shut Checking the
panel

DYLAN
Hes going down

They take the stairs
INT BASEMENT SERVICE HALLWAY - DAY

Natalie and Dylan emerge from the staircase to find the
elevator empty To the left exit doors swing tellingly

EXT DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY

Nat and Dylan smash through the exit doors and out into
the sun-drenched streets of beautiful downtown Los
Angeles Natalie immediately spots the Thin Man booking
down the alley

NATALIE
That way

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 28

And they take off after him

What ensues is the fastest wildest two chicks and one
guy foot chase youve ever seen Here are some highlights
-- Thin Man pulls himself clumsily over a chain link
fence Dylan and Natalie pull an old Jackie Chan trick
and run up the side wall and hop over easily

-- Thin Man still on foot waits for traffic to slow
then darts across the Harbor Freeway By the time Dylan
and Natalie get there traffic is roaring again
Undeterred they make their way through tucking and
rolling under the wheels of a moving semi

-- Dylan is racing down an alley when a car comes barrelling
at her She leaps up onto the hood of the car as it drives
underneath her a la one of those Thats Incredible stunts

-- They chase the Thin Man into an industrial laundromat
The scene goes something like this

INT INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY ROOM

Thunderously LOUD with industrial washers and dryers operating
at full tilt Natalie and Dylan are just entering when

THREE SHOTS

ring out They dive for cover behind a massive washer
assembly
NATALIE
There are times I wish we carried
guns
DYLAN

Wheres the challenge in that

ANGLE ON the Thin Man planning his next move With no
good shot at the angels he aims high both guns BLAZING
He shots out the pipes over their heads sending down a
cascade of hot water

Dylan and Natalie scramble back to avoid getting scalded

Other pipes SHATTER from the change in pressure leading
to an interior thunderstorm Steam fills the room as an
inch of water grows on the floor

Natalie and Dylan push rolling laundry carts in the Thin
Mans direction He shoots at them but quickly realizes
theyre just trying to waste his bullets

Holstering one of his guns he dials his cell phone

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 29

On the far wall Natalie switches on the overhead hooks
which circle on a wire like a ski lift The Thin Man
looks up distracted not noticing --

DYLAN

As she creeps up behind the cover of the rolling laundry
carts Shes succeeded in circling behind the Thin Man
as he talks on the phone

She clears her throat The Thin Man turns She kicks
him in the jaw

Knocked back he drops the phone which CRACKS and slips
under a washing machine

He crab-walks back then suddenly springs back to his feet
We werent expecting that kind of ninja move out of this guy

HE TURNS TO SEE
NATALIE

right behind him With a coiled towel she grabs his gun
arm and expertly flips him But he reacts smoothly rolling
over to charge at Natalie picking her up like a sack of
potatoes As he does he grabs her right in the tit

NATALIE
Hey Hands off assh

Before she can finish her sentence the Thin Man throws
Natalie at Dylan knocking them both down He jumps up

and with a single motion grabs an overhead pipe and kicks
another releasing a wall of steam -- we cant see a thing

By the time the fog clears the Thin Man is long gone

NATALIE
Okay to summarize Damn

Lying down in the water Dylan reaches under the washer
to fish out the Thin Mans busted cell phone

INT TOWNSEND AGENCY BACK ROOM - DAY

Natalie sits at a glowing computer monitor the Thin
Mans cell phone connected by a data cable to the
Townsend Agency computers Rapidly touching the screen
she calls up a list of the last thirty-five phone calls
he received Theyre all from the same location

BOSLEY
Well That was easy

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 30

NATALIE
No it wasnt

She points to some code next to the numbers

NATALIE (CONTD)
Ive seen this before hes
scrambling his calls through a
secondary location

BOSLEY
In English

NATALIE
We need to tap this phone line
at the source THEN well know
where his calls were coming from

DYLAN
(checking out the numbers)
503 Thats not local where is it

NATALIE
Bos can we check a directory

ALEX
Dont bother I know where it is
I used to spend every winter there
As she says it
CUT TO
EXT ASPEN - NIGHT

The sign says it Welcome to Aspen

VARIOUS ESTABLISHING SHOTS of the gorgeous mountain town
still somehow quaint despite its astonishing wealth
EXT COWBOY BAR -- NIGHT

A rowdy establishment just outside of town

INT COWBOY BAR -- CONTINUOUS

The kind of place that rich weekend skiers dont come
Lots of over-aggressive cowboy-biker types drinking more
than they should There are only a few women in the place
and they are either waitresses or biker chicks Suddenly
everyone stops what theyre doing and turns to the door

CHARLIES ANGELS have entered the room Dressed in their
stylish ensembles they couldnt possibly look more out of
place

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 31

NATALIE
Hey look Mechanical bull
DYLAN
Eyes on the prize Nat We gotta
tap the phones
ALEX

That looks like our target
She points to a door at the back of the bar that leads
into a glassed-in office Two beefy bouncer types are guarding

the door

ALEX (CONTD)
Im gonna need a distraction

Dylan and Natalie smile at each other

DYLAN
I think that can be arranged

The Three Angels split up Bosley tagging along with Dylan
DYLAN

sidles up to the bar A group of three rednecks are
downing shots one after another

DYLAN (CONTD)
Three shots of tequila please
(Bosley whispers in her ear)
And one Tom Collins

The rednecks stare at Dylan drooling Dylan turns to the first
one

REDNECK
Hey baby why dont you ditch that
stiff and come sit on ma lap

Bosley tries to make himself small

DYLAN
Ooh that is an enticing offer
But I got a better idea How
about a shot contest My treat

The three rednecks hoot and holler
DYLAN (CONTD)
Okay Ill take that as a yes Bartender
Bring ten shots of tequila over to my

table And keep em coming

BY THE MECHANICAL BULL

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 32

A group of wanna bes are waiting their turn at the
mechanical bull Natalie wanders over behind them

NATALIE
Mind if I try

The crowd parts for her and Natalie hops up on the bull
She cranks it up and lets

BY THE BAR --

Dylan downs a shot slams it on the table Countless
other glasses surround her

REVEAL that two of the rednecks are down for the count one
falling out of his chair the other passed out on the table

The third redneck is slurring badly trying to keep up
with Dylan
DYLAN
Hey Ive got an idea Now lets
have a chair throwing contest

REDNECK
Hunh

DYLAN
Chair throwing Never heard of
it You just pick up your chair
and throw it as far as you can

The redneck nods lifts up his chair and heaves it across
the bar

OKAY HERES AN OUTLINE OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE REST OF
THIS SCENE

Dylan and Natalie create a distraction while Alex sneaks
into the back office with Bosley to get the phone number
of the chalet

EXT HIGH MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT

A VW van climbs the winding road As we get closer we see the
side reads Chalet Grams

A DING-DONG DING-DING-DONG doorbell rings
INT MOUNTAIN HOUSE GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

TWO THUGS with shoulder holsters look up hearing the bell
One was tending to the fire

THUG ONE
We expecting somebody

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 33

Thug Two shakes his head

Checking his gun Thug One grabs for his windbreaker
Puts it on over

EXT FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Thug One opens the door to find Dylan and Natalie dressed
in Swiss Miss outfits complete with blonde braids

DYLAN
Guten Tag

NATALIE
(correcting Dylan)
Guten Morgen

DYLAN
(correcting Natalie)
Guten Nacht

DYLAN AND NATALIE
(to each other)
Guten Freund

The girls lean in and hug each other butts sticking out
To the left Bosley starts playing oommpa OOMMPA oommpa
OOMMPA on a wrap-around tuba Hes wearing lederhosen
with a feather in his hat

Natalie begins to YODEL

Dylan hands a fancy envelope to the bewildered thug Thug
Two is approaching from behind curious what the hell is
going on

Dylan begins to TALK-SING a song in German about a too-
curious goat and his worried mistress Even with the pantomime
we have no idea whats happening It seems

wholesome but occasionally one of the girls touches the

other in a weirdly coquettish oddly sexual way

Thug Two looks at the address on the envelope
THUG TWO
(low)
They got the wrong address

THUG ONE
Shut up

As the angels continue their routine the CAMERA RISES
three quick cuts to take us to

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 34
EXT THE ROOF - NIGHT

where a black cat-suited Alex stands at the
chimney A ribbon of smoke curls from the stack

Pulling the pin from a canister she drops it down the
chimney
INT MOUNTAIN HOUSE GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

A cheerful fire burns in the over-sized fireplace The
canister drops into the flames from above suddenly
venting a HISSING cloud of halon gas The fire dies
immediately the logs covered with a violent frost

INT THE CHIMNEY - NIGHT

Alex doesnt even need a rope Her feet pressed to the
sooty walls she expertly slides to the bottom

INT GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

Alex backs out of the fireplace to find a WAITING BAD GUY
swinging

A FIREPLACE POKER

at her head She ducks just in time The poker CHINGS
against the stone making a spark

Rolling jumping and diving Alex scurries as Pokerman
slashes and stabs She ducks behind a chair which
Pokerman catches with the hook winging it across the
room

Backed against the wall Alex yanks on the heavy
curtains pulling them down along with the wooden
curtain rod A spin a flourish of velvet and the
curtain rings drop off to leave her with a trusty
quarterstaff

She goes on the offensive Thrust parry spin

But hes a worthy adversary One good karate kick breaks
her staff in two She uses both pieces to club him in
the knees then rolls back to the fireplace

She grabs the remaining tool the fireplace tongs
Pokerman swings Alex catches his weapon in the tong
scissors yanking it free with such force the point sticks
in the wall

A quick kick knocks Pokerman to the floor where Alex
rolls on top of him She catches his head in the tongs
squeezing his temples His eyes bulge

ALEX
Wheres Knox
CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 35
INT WINDOWLESS ROOM - NIGHT

Young billionaire ERIC KNOX paces Hes grungy with
two days of stubble but still a darn attractive guy

Hearing a KICK at the door he turns
A second KICK blows the door open Its Alex

KNOX
Who are you

ALEX
The calvary Giddy up

EXT FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Bosley is about to hyper-ventilate on the tuba sweaty
and a little blue

Dylan and Natalies new song has them sharing the saddle
of an imaginary horse When Dylan reaches back to slap
the horse she hits Natalie in the rump Both women
tee-hee

The thugs think its pretty hot

Dylan whispers a secret to Natalie Natalie WHISPERS
back

Turning to the thugs they each lean in to WHISPER into
a different thugs ear As the men smile the angels
suddenly BONK the two mens heads together Both men
fall knocked out

Stepping over the bodies Dylan heads inside
INT MOUNTAIN HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT

Looking for the way out Alex leads Knox to a closed
door She opens it to find

INT TV ROOM - NIGHT

TWO MORE THUGS sitting in front the big-screen TV
watching a college basketball game (Duke vs Maryland
in case you care) The guards look back spotting Alex

with Knox

That wouldnt be so bad if it werent for the
FIFTEEN OTHER THUGS
watching the game with them

ANGLE ON Alex Its an oh-shit moment

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899

ALEX
Sorry Wrong room
(to Knox)
Back Run

The thugs are out of their seats a moment later each of
them pulling out a firearm

EXT FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Holding down three keys on the tuba Bosley talks into
the mouthpiece It has a secret radio

BOSLEY
Alex whats your status

INT STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Running Alex pushes Knox ahead of her checking their
backs She talks into a wrist-mic

ALEX
Good news I found Knox
Another THUG steps out in front of her She kicks him

down the steps

ALEX (CONTD)
Bad news I found company

Reaching the bottom of the steps Knox is surprised to be
grabbed by Dylan

DYLAN
This way

At this point hell do whatever they say

EXT FRONT OF MOUNTAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

Dylan rushes Knox across the driveway to the waiting van
-- Natalie is pulling it around Overhead bright
security lights switch on

Back at the front door Alex pulls it shut She attaches
a carabiner clip to the handle running a thin steel cord
from it around the porch column

INT FOYER - NIGHT

The first of the thugs reaches the door tries to pull it
open but cant The next few guards try to help him

while the rest start smashing through the windows

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 37
EXT FRONT OF MOUNTAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

Running with the tuba Bosley stops for a moment to catch
his breath hands on his knees Okay ready to run
again

Hes the last to be pulled into the van A spray of
gravel and theyre off

INT THE VAN - NIGHT

Everyone is piled on top of each other Dylan and Knox
have a few awkward moments as they get untangled Bosley
keeps making inappropriate TUBA NOISES

At the wheel Natalie is fierce and focused in total
control

Looking out the back windows Alex sees the kidnappers
piling into jeeps to give chase From the side of the
house more thugs appear on motorbikes

ALEX
Theyre coming after us

DYLAN
(to Knox confident)
We were expecting that

NATALIE
Okay new problem

Everyones attention WHIPS FORWARD to see the headlights of

GIANT LOGGING TRUCK
coming up the high mountain road It straddles the
center line blocking both directions Theres no way
around it
NATALIE (CONTD)
Thoughts suggestions points to
consider

BOSLEY
I dont suppose giving up would
be a
No it wouldnt Then --
DYLAN
Right
NATALIE

There is no right

DYLAN
There

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 38

She points to a faded CLOSED sign that hangs from a
chain In the darkness who knows what its blocking
But as we hear the THUNDEROUS HORN from the oncoming
truck we know theres no choice
Natalie cuts a hard right SMASHING through the sign
The van THUMPS AND BUMPS its way across the low grass
its headlights only showing ten feet ahead At any
moment the ground could stop in a cliff

Like now

The van leaps into empty space Tires spin helpless
The van falls

Everyone SCREAMS Bosley is the loudest

And then touchdown The van hits the ground hard but
not catastrophically Natalie hits the brakes cuts the
wheel hard to avoid hitting

A CONCRETE WALL
in front of them Everyone takes a beat to acknowledge
theyre alive

DYLAN
Where are we

Suddenly a BRIGHT LIGHT goes on overhead
EXT THE MOUNTAIN - NIGHT

One by one a series of arc lights switches on forming a
snake all the way to the bottom of the mountain

INT THE VAN - NIGHT
Looking out the back windows

ALEX
Its a bobsled run

Theyre facing backwards

Up ahead the kidnappers are charging down the access roads
The first of two jeeps makes the jump into the bobsled chute

NATALIE
If it goes down the mountain
thats all I need

Throwing it into reverse Natalie peels out

The jeeps follow

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 39
EXT BOBSLED RUN - NIGHT

The VW Van leads the way down the mountain tail-first

As it builds speed it starts to climb the wall each turn

getting steeper and steeper

The two jeeps are following Facing the right direction
they have a much easier time of it

INT VAN - NIGHT
Everything is shaking so violently it looks like a NASA launch

ALEX
(looking out the back)
Hard left HARD LEFT
Natalie makes the turn The van rises up nearly tilting
over But they make it through the turn

KNOX
(to Dylan)
Is this part of the plan

DYLAN
Yes Except for the bobsled run
and the backwards part its
going exactly according to plan
A beat He smiles at her He has a nice smile

EXT BOBSLED RUN - NIGHT

One of the jeeps makes a move closing the distance to
the van A RIFLEMAN leans out the passenger window
lining up a shot He FIRES

INT THE VAN - NIGHT

The shot blasts cleanly through the top of the windshield
through the horn of Bosleys tuba then out the back window It
missed hitting somebody by millimeters

Natalie is still focused making each turn as Alex calls it

EXT BOBSLED RUN - NIGHT
The front jeep gets even more aggressive building speed
It hits the next turn too fast rising up too high along
the wall It tips further and further finally rolling
over onto its back It SCRAPES across the concrete a
shower of sparks as it slows down
With nowhere to go the second jeep brakes hard but cant stop
It SMASHES into the first jeep a tangle of steel

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 40

The combined mass continues sliding down the run like a
jagged pinball in the chute

INT THE VAN - NIGHT

Dylan looks out through the windshield as the jeep combo recedes
farther and farther away
DYLAN
I think were in the clear

Just then two MOTORBIKES race up along the chute walls passing
the crippled jeeps Two more MOTORBIKES jump in from above

DYLAN
Or maybe not

Suddenly Natalie GASPS remembering something

NATALIE
Oh God no

DYLAN
What is it

WHIP CUT TO

festival two tickets in hand

NATALIE

DYLAN
Hello I saw the way he looked at you

One motorcycle charges coming up just feet from the
windshield Natalie taps on the brakes The freaked out
guy cant slow down in time He SMACKS into the windshield
then goes flying

ALEX
Were at the bottom

Indeed we are The concrete walls end leaving open ground
Slamming on the brakes Natalie turns the van around
Everyone goes flying Bosley is still on the phone with
Charlie

EXT BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN - NIGHT

Back facing the right direction the van charges onward
The motorcycles race up to the passenger side grabbing
for the door

INT THE VAN - NIGHT
Dylan SLAMS open the door knocking one RIDER off
The sliding door opens another RIDER outside trying to get
in Thinking fast Knox grabs Bosleys tuba and shoves it
at the motorcyclist who tumbles taking out the fourth
rider in the process
DYLAN
(genuinely impressed)

Natalie pats him on the arm She and Alex exchange a quick
glance They have to just laugh

In the back row Knox is looking out over the gorgeous lights
of Aspen

DYLAN

darn good-looking man Vivian Wu follows him

CHARLIES VOICE (CONTD)
Meet your new client Eric Knox

KNOX
First off thank you You rescued
me for which I am eternally grateful

Hes talking to all the angels but his gaze seems to fall
most upon Dylan She notices it

KNOX (CONTD)
But theres still a problem Whoever
kidnapped me wasnt just trying to
screw up our IPO They also stole
the proprietary software for our new
web browser Im sure it was Roger
Corwin but I need proof

CHARLIES VOICE
Thats where you come in Angels
CIRCLING AROUND we see the video images of Corwin and the
Red Star Systems logo on the big screen

CHARLIES VOICE (CONTD)
We need to break into Red Stars computer
systems to see if Mr Knoxs software is
indeed being converted for Red Stars use

NATALIE
Sounds like a plan

CHARLIES VOICE
Not as easy as that Natalie Red
Stars headquarters are as tightly
guarded as a military facility
Were going to need reconnaissance
on their mainframe computer system
and the best way to get that is
through Mr Corwin himself

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 44

A video image of Corwins Palm Pilot Schedule comes up the
bigscreen The shot pulls in close on SAN DIEGO SPEEDWAY

CHARLIES VOICE (CONTD)
We need to pin a camera on him to get
footage of the inside of the building
Thanks to Alexs work at the health spa
we know that Corwin will be at the San
Diego Speedway on Thursday Get close to
him Angels but dont tip your hand

DYLAN
(a smile)
Lucky for us

She takes a marker-sized device off the table

DYLAN (CONTD)
This is a panic button
(tosses it to him)
Press it and one of us can be here
in ten minutes

KNOX

DYLAN

He tosses her the panic button
KNOX
Stay for dinner
(preempting objections)

Im a pretty good cook

DYLAN

Dylan is surprised by this

KNOX (CONTD)
Look I didnt want to admit it but I
am I was kidnapped once and it wasnt

plans but it would be very reassuring

Dylan looks him over Normally shed be suspicious but
the guy WAS just kidnapped and he seems sincere

KNOX (CONTD)

She throws her coat back on the sofa

KNOX
Thanks

(taking the photo)
Its the only picture I have of me with
my parents They died a week later

DYLAN
Oh Oh Im sorry I had no idea

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 47

Dylan nods

KNOX

Please dont apologize I was too
young to understand

(looking at the photo)
I never knew how they died When I
was a kid when I got shuffled from
one foster home to another I always
thought they just disappeared

DYLAN
But

KNOX

I only found out later my father was
in the military He and my mother were
killed while he was on assignment
somewhere in Eastern Europe

(mostly to himself)
The files were classified but I
read enough to know that he was a
good man Apparently he was
betrayed by one of his own team

DYLAN
Wow Thats a lot for a kid to live with

KNOX
Yeah but it motivated me losing my
family It still does I dont take
anything for granted

DYLAN
Boy did I have you pegged wrong

KNOX
(intrigued)
How do you mean

DYLAN
Well to be honest I thought you
were a rich kid who inherited
everything But thats pretty typical
Ive got instincts for the job but
when it comes to men Well

KNOX
Im glad you dont see me as just a client

He brushes his hand against hers She brushes back

fingers
against fingers A long beat

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899

Oh Well you ARE so
KNOX
Is there someone you need to be going

ROARING past on the track Its all thunder smoke and
asphalt We are
EXT SAN DIEGO SPEEDWAY - DAY

With a ROAR another blur of racers whips past with heat
and noise and speed The lead car bears the familiar
markings of RED STAR INDUSTRIES Roger Corwin is at the
wheel steering calmly to a comfortable lead when he is
suddenly BUMPED

CORWIN
What the

ANOTHER BUMP sends him screeching to the left He almost
crashes then gets back on course just as hes passed by

A SLEEK BLACK CAR sponsored by the SONY CORPORATION and
manned by a mysterious driver with TEXAS TORNADO inscripted on
the helmet We follow the black car as it pulls into the pit

EXT FREEWAY PIT - DAY

The racer pulls off her helmet as the pit crew surrounds her
Of course the racer is Natalie aka BETTY LOU HOBERT the Texas
Tornado

engine noise)

Natalie shakes out her hair winks at the pit boss

The Pit Crew races in to make repairs DYLAN dressed ina
pit suit kneels by Natalies front tire Natalie crouches
down next to her so they can talk

NATALIE (CONTD)
I nicked him Should give you
enough time to do the deed
DYLAN
Im on it

Dylan steals away heading for
CORWINS PIT CREW --
Corwin is seething mad as he pulls into his pit

CORWIN
LETS GO WERE LOSING TIME HERE

The pit repairs his car as Corwin is approached by another
racer also wearing a Red Star racing suit He leans into
Corwins car and now we see thats its THE THIN MAN

THIN MAN
You okay Boss

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 50

CORWIN
No thanks to you Youre supposed
to be my head of security Who is

that bitch

The Thin Man peers over at Natalie but shes got her
back to him

THIN MAN

Dont know Ill keep an eye out
CORWIN

Yeah You do that

Corwin peels out onto the track again almost crushing
the Thin Man in the process

AS CORWIN PULLS OUT

Dylan sneaks in In all the cacophony no one notices

as she grabs CORWINS SUITCASE out of the back seat of
his regular car a bitching Mercedes She checks both

ways to see if shes being watched

BOSLEY (0S)
Coast is clear Dylan
CuT TO
EXT THE WINNERS CIRCLE

Where Alex dressed as a trophy girl watches the race
through binoculars and keeps an eye on her pals She
nods to BOSLEY who is dressed as the Flag Waver He
speaks into a walkie talkie

BOSLEY
Lets make the switch

BACK IN THE PIT --

Dylan pulls a briefcase out of her jumpsuit and swaps
it with one in Corwins car She carefully switches all
his files from the old briefcase to the new one then
gives Alex a thumbs up

MEANWHILE BACK IN THE RACE --

NATALIE roars back onto the track keeping Corwin in her
sights Then she spots another Red Star car coming up
right next to her She locks eyes with the Thin Man

The two of them recognize each other at the exact same
instant

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 51

The Thin Man realizing hes been made jams on the
brakes and skids off to the right which leads to a ramp
that heads out of the stadium
Natalie not wanting to lose him does something crazy
Even though shes at the front of the pack she brakes
hard swerves into a full 180 degree U-turn and starts

heading the WRONG WAY on the race track

Startled drivers pull off to the left and right as she
follows the Thin Man out of the racetrack

EXT SPEEDWAY ACCESS ROAD - DAY

To a chorus of CAR HORNS the Thin Mans blue racer weaves
through the spectator traffic entering the speedway
Looking back we see Natalie is gaining on him
Finally clear of the traffic both cars let it rip

CUT TO
HELICOPTER VIDEO FOOTAGE

Looking down on a freeway where a ubiquitous police
pursuit is in progress

TV ANCHOR VOICE
If youre just joining us were
approaching hour five of a pursuit
that has lead us all across the
Southland at speeds up to 80
miles an hour

A beat-up gray Chrysler leads a phalanx of police cars
down the empty freeway Its oddly calm and hypnotizing

FEMALE ANCHOR VOICE
Chuck time and again we hear the
question Why dont the police just
ram the other car or shoot out the
tires The LAPD has a policy of
hanging back and following unless

Suddenly the blue Formula One car comes screeching past
the cops and the suspect over 200 miles per hour

TV ANCHOR VOICE
What was that

INT NATALIES RED CAR ON THE FREEWAY - DAY
Still hot on the Thin Mans tail Natalie has the engine
ROARING

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 52

As she passes the police cars we see several OFFICERS
look over -- what the hell

Natalie catches up to the gray Chrysler Looks over to
see the WILD-EYED SUSPECT hunched over the wheel

He looks back at her A beat later shes passed him
just taillights on the freeway
EXT FREEWAY - DAY

With the lanes cleared for the other chase there is
nothing preventing the Formula One cars from hitting top
speed -- which they do

Natalie is catching up to the Thin Man

As they head under an overpass we see KIDS CHEERING

INT BLUE CAR - DAY

The Thin Man checks his gauges The gas dial is perilously
close to empty -- these cars are meant to be refilled often

Up ahead he sees an exit He starts to slow down
EXT FREEWAY - DAY

but when youre going 200 miles per hour that can
take a while He misses the exit

Natalie is trying to match his speed

The Thin Man pulls over to the side stops fully
Braking as hard as she can Natalie still passes him

The Thin Man throws a U-turn heading up the freeway on-ramp
Natalie follows

EXT SAN DIEGO SHIPYARD - DAY

We catch glimpses behind fences and between train cars --

the two racers gliding slowly down the narrow roads like
lions pacing

INT NATALIES RED CAR - DAY

Pulling off her helmet Natalie scans right and left for

the blue car -- shes lost sight of him The narrow
windshields of these racers doesnt make it any easier

EXT SHIPYARD - DAY

We LOOK DOWN on Natalies car as she rounds a corner
still searching

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 53

EXT PIER - DAY
Natalie spots the blue racer reaching the end of the
long pier It pulls a U-turn to face her then stops
engine idling Theres only way off the pier and its
past Natalie

The Thin Man REVS his engine

Natalie REVS hers

ANGLE ON a white seagull pecking at something on the
pier halfway between the two racers The bird looks up

hearing the engines

ANGLE ON the Thin Man He pulls his harness tighter
REVS his engine higher

ANGLE ON Natalie If its a game of chicken he wants
shell give it to him She REVS her engine higher still

The noise scares the bird who suddenly flies off Like
a flag being dropped thats the signal for both racers
to peel out

A cloud of SMOKE Rubber on asphalt
Already reaching a tremendous speed the racers are ona

collision course The Thin Man isnt going to turn away
Neither is Natalie

Racing faster and faster still theres only one way
this can turn out But then at the very last moment
the Thin Man wusses out He cuts the wheel right
missing Natalie and careening off the edge of the pier

In SLOW MOTION we watch as his racer hangs in mid-air
wheels still spinning Back-heavy the tail hits the
water first

Natalie brakes hard cuts the wheel to avoid going off
the far end of the pier She finally stops the rear
tire just 14 inch from the edge

CRANING UP along the side of the pier we find Natalie
looking into the water where the blue racer went in
Theres just a slick of oil and a steady stream of bubbles

CUT TO
VIDEO CAMERAS POV

We see lots of hallways doorways and security locks all
from the POV of a mans hip

The footage is from the camera in the switched briefcase
that Corwin is now carrying with him

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 54

We PULL BACK from the video to see we are actually
watching it

INT CHARLES TOWNSEND AGENCY - DAY

on the big screen The angels and Bosley watch the
footage along with Knox and Vivian Wu Vivian has
seated herself close to Natalie So close in fact that
Natalie keeps having to shift a few inches

Dylan meanwhile sits across the room from Knox
deliberately avoiding eye contact

ON THE BIG SCREEN As the videocamera passes a room
marked with an intimidating warning sign

KNOX
There

VIDEO FREEZES

KNOX (CONTD)
Thats the room with the
mainframe Everything at Red Star
goes through that system

CHARLIES VOICE
So if we want to find proof that
Red Star stole Knoxs technology
thats the computer to tap

KNOX
Exactly But they have heavy firewalls
and encryption You cant jack in from
outside Youll have to physically be
in that room to get at the data

ALEX
Even if we do get inside there wont
be time to search for it Theres got
to be a hundred terabytes of
information there It could take days
NATALIE
So you install a transmitter

All eyes go over to Natalie

NATALIE (CONTD)
Patch in directly to the relay
broadcast on a high frequency
That way you can have access to
the mainframe from the comfort of
your own home And they have no
idea that you can peek inside

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 55

Knox is impressed The other angels nod Its a good idea

VIVIAN WU
Thats all fine in theory But you
still have to get inside that room
to install it What about security

ALEX
Red Star has a lot of Government
contracts so security is tight Key-
card badges throughout Redundant
security at all red-line areas with
biometric scanners and weekly keycodes
Pervasive video surveillance lasers
air-displacement sensors Plus a hard-
wired fail-safe at the relay to prevent
exactly this kind of tapping

VIVIAN WU
It sounds impossible

Alex checks with her fellow angels Theyre in agreement

DYLAN
It sounds like fun

With a subtle RUSH we move into a stylized MONTAGE that
shows How They Do It It features WHIP PANS FREEZE

Hey is someone firing more squibs
Or

Suddenly without warning the wall is plastered with

SILENCED GUNFIRE Its only Alexs instincts that let
her duck in time to avoid being turned into Swiss cheese

She tucks and rolls behind a Styrofoam set as

TWO GUNMEN with silenced SNIPER rifles fan out on the
fake city street

ON ALEX --

crouched behind a wall

She looks both ways If she tries to break for the open
loading door shell lead the gunmen right back to Jason
Only way out of here is to head for the far wall all the
way across the building where theres a fire exit
Taking a deep breath she darts across the fake street

THE GUNMEN

fire at her one of them pulling off his silencer and going
to machine gun mode The sound of the gunshots are covered
by the sound of the effects guy test firing guns outside

ALEX --

Sees that the sets are held up by wooden support beams
She lifts her leg and delivers a solid blow cracking the
two-by-fours in half

THE GUNMEN
move slowly through the fake street set Suddenly they
hear a creaking sound They look up to see the whole

fake building set collapsing

They dive out of the way just in time to see Alex race
through the fire doors

Who is perched atop the stall walls She pushed the door

with her foot

Grabbing an overhead pipe she performs an acrobatic
swing landing both feet on the guys head He falls
into the next row of stalls

Natalie reaches for the gun but the Man grabs her ankles
He pulls her back across the tile floor flipping her over

That just makes it easier for her to kick him where it counts

With a scissors lock around his neck Natalie is pulled
up while the Man falls She lands a knee on his windpipe

VIVIAN WU (CONTD)
(on phone)
Really How disappointing

Vivian gestures to the abandoned Scrabble game on the table
Why not play

DYLAN
Im not much for games

VIVIAN WU
Pity

As Knox flips pages in the report Dylan casually begins
pushing Scrabble letters around nothing serious But shes
managed to spell

ENEMY

She gets Knoxs attention looks to the word up to Vivian
Knox follows her intention but doesnt seem to believe it

While Vivian continues to talk on the phone Knox sets his
report down Pushes around some letters of his own The
words finally come out as
I KNOW
CLOSE ON Dylan What does that mean

Vivian snaps her phone shut

(to Knox)

Bad news The other angels are still

alive Good news Everything else

proceeding apace
Dylan stands up What the hell is going on
Vivian draws the gun on her Knox moves over toward

Vivians side

KNOX
Sorry Dylan I knew this moment
would come sooner or later I was
just hoping for later

A long beat Dylan trying to wrap her head around this

DYLAN
All this time we thought Red Star
was behind this but it was you
(realizing)
You faked your kidnapping

Knox taps his nose Shes got it

DYLAN (CONTD)

Why

KNOX
To gain your trust And get your
help

(beat)
I want you to know my personal
attraction to you was a sincere
and unrelated complication

DYLAN
Oh well in that case I feel a lot
better about you being a lying pole
smoker

Dylan looks like shes about to leap forward and tear Knoxs
throat out Vivian gestures for Dylan to keep stepping back

DYLAN (CONTD)
I cant believe I trusted you

KNOX
Why not You trust Charlie and youve
never even met him

Dylan crosses the sill out onto the balcony

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 73

KNOX (CONTD)
And believe me theres a lot about
him that you dont know Anyway
Im not going to be an idiot and
stand here talking when we could do
something useful like KILL YOU
Goodbye Dylan Ill miss you

How right he is because as soon as Vivian squeezes the
trigger

Dylan drops to the floor then rolls

BLAM

the bullet misses Dylan and slams into the bulletproof window
causing a spider-web crack to spread Dylan sees her
opportunity and heads right for the window while Vivian

pumps off shots

As she comes to the window Dylan jumps up in the air and
does a flying kick hitting right at the spot where the
bullet impacted

SMASH

The bulletproof glass shatters outward and Dylan flies out
the window onto the ledge

KNOX (CONTD)
Wow

Ive never seen YOU do something
like that

VIVIAN WU
Oh shut up

Dylan looks over the edge of the balcony The drop-off is
incredibly steep -- the house is built on stilts -- and the
fall looks like it would kill her But she doesnt have

jump They rush to the edge look down into a forbidding
thicket of trees

KNOX
No just leaving myself plenty of
margin for error Goodbye Dylan

With that he walks out of the room

The Thin Man signals to the Henchmen Two of them force
Dylan to sit in one of the wooden deck chairs

Then with the thick packing tape they begin binding her
arms to the arms of the chair As they do

I dont know why you bother Ive

DYLAN

Every moment I sit here is a
moment Im using to figure out how

Can you hold on a sec

Hitting MUTE Natalie kicks the chair behind her and dives
under the desk She comes up on the other side with a

their bodies

She re-mutes

With a roundhouse kick she flattens one of the goons
WHACKS the other with the cell phone

more up-front about that its just

At the last moment Natalie catches a moving reflection
in a shiny trophy Turns to find Vivian Wu swinging an
antique chair at her head
She ducks The chair SHATTERS the display case
Scrambling to get away Natalie drops the phone

PETE
Natalie what was that

NATALIE
(yelling to phone)
Everythings fine

VIVIAN WU
Hate to disagree

Vivian upends the desk nearly crushing Natalie Vivian
jumps on top ready to kick the shit out of our angel

As we probably suspected Vivian Wu is one hell of a
martial artist Fortunately so is Natalie

In their first series of blows Vivian seems to have the
upper hand but Natalie rallies hard Vivian surprises
her with a floor-sweeping kick knocking her down

Vivian grabs the phone off the floor

VIVIAN WU (CONTD)
Is this the famous Charlie

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 87

No its Pete
Vivian looks at the phone Who the fuck cares She

throws the phone out the open window

Getting up Natalie stares her down incredulity building
to rage

NATALIE
You bitch I like that guy

Mocking Vivian wipes away a tear

Natalie lets forth a typhoon of fury a full-out Mortal
Kombat Vivian is thrown back against the bookcase
where she knocks over a candlestick

Thats the trigger for the bookcases to begin sinking
into the floor Circling around the room each set of
shelves drops to a different level forming steps that
lead to the upstairs room

As Natalie and Vivian continue to fight Bosley sticks
his head down from above watching the brawl Natalie is
kicking ass

NATALIE (CONTD)
(to Vivian)
Do you have any idea how difficult it
is to find a quality man in Los Angeles

She slams Vivian into the wall Grabs her again hands
around her head

VIVIAN WU
To be honest

Vivian suddenly leans forward and KISSES her right on
the lips

VIVIAN WU (CONTD)
I dont care

Natalie is surprised for a moment which gives Vivian the
chance to swing at her She misses

I can handle villainy I can even
handle super-villainy

misses again)
But what you did is just wrong

crashes into the railing tearing it off She stands

Okay that part worked

The Guards FIRE -- but Dylan has already launched herself
from the railing into that backflip which lands her on
the head of --

Fat Boy flattening him bad and smashing the rest of the
chair into kindling She grabs the wooden seat and whips
it up catching bullets from Guard 3 before flinging it
like a Frisbee at Guard 2 nailing him right on the chin

Quickly she stands again between Guards 3 and 4

DYLAN (CONTD)
Now guys I warned you This is
where you shoot each other

The two men scoff disbelieving Then Dylan does a head
fake both Guards panic and fire but Dylan drops leaving
each man a clear shot at the other Both gape Both fall

Just Guards 5 and 6 left Dylans chair arms are still
taped to her forearms

DYLAN (CONTD)
Okay heres where we improvise

In a whirl she overhead-chops Guard 5 Drives her
right arm into his shoulder while swinging her left arm
into the back of the Guard 6s head

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 89

A few more blows then both men fall

Now Dylan drops into a second chair half-exhausted
half-amused with herself Has one brief beat to take it
all in then --

Bosley steps onto the veranda sees Dylan sitting in the
chair

FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW It looks like Dylan -- whose
arms are still strapped to the arms of the first chair --
is taped to the chair she now sits in

No no Im sick of this shit Im
sick of this asshole telling you
what you can and cant do

And then with no warning he hauls off and punches the
Thin Man

Now Jasons just an actor not an ass-kicking super
detective so his punch isnt all that great In fact it
leaves Jason shaking his hand in pain

The Thin Man a trickle of blood running from his lip smiles

THIN MAN
That was stupid

First he pops Jason right in the jaw Jason stumbles
backward dazed Then he reaches for his gun in the
process loosening his grip on Alex

ALEX
Jason get down

Alex spins out of the Thin Mans grasp and does a full
roundhouse kick knocking the gun out of the Thin Mans
hands The Thin Man immediately responds throwing two
quick punches which Alex expertly blocks and then follows
with a hitch-kick to the chin

Jason dazed and confused thinks he must be hallucinating

JASON
What the hell is going on

Whats going on is a world class ass-kicking courtesy of his
girlfriend While the action star watches in amazement Alex
unloads an arsenal of bad ass kung fu moves that would make
Jet Li green with envy

The Thin Man doesnt stand a chance A flying side kick
sends him stumbling backwards into the stairwell We
follow the fight

INT STAIRWELL -- CONTINUOUS

to the first landing The Thin Man battered and bruised
reaches down to his ankle holster to get his spare gun but
Alex is too fast for him She stamps on his hand then

drops a knee to his throat

ALEX
Right now just by leaning forward I
could crush your windpipe Youd die
a slow and painful death You dont
want that do you

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 96

The Thin Man shakes his head no

ALEX (CONTD)
Where is the bomb whens it going off

She presses harder

INT HALLWAY

Jason slams out into the stairwell looking for Alex He
finds her on her walkie talkie the Thin Man handcuffed
to the staircase

ALEX
Hi Jason Gimme one second

Jason nods sure

We go to another triptych all three Angels on their cell
phones in different parts of arena

ALEX (CONTD)
Angels Knox planted the bomb in the
basement and its timed to go off
when the game clock hits zero

NATALIE (0S)
Roger that Alex Ill stop the clock

DYLAN (0S)
Ill look for the bomb

Alex turns back to Jason Hes clearly having a difficult
time processing everything hes just seen

ALEX
I lied to you Jason Im not a
secretary

JASON

Yeah I can see that
ALEX
(referring to the
Thin Man)
And that wasnt Charlie

JASON
Right

ALEX
Im actually here to stop a madman
from killing everyone in this
building Would it be okay if we
talked later

( )
CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 97

JASON
Go save the world honey
(beat)
Ill be waiting for you
Alex smiles Runs off
INT ARENA
Natalie stares up at the clock 30 229
The WHISTLE BLOWS
REFEREE
Time out
Whew that was close But itll start up any second She

has to keep it stopped But how She glances to the
sidelines and gets an idea

ON THE COURT --

MUSIC starts from overhead the respective teams cheerleaders
coming out for one last routine

As they kick into gear Natalie comes out with them dressed
as a Duke cheerleader She follows along with the dancers a
bit timid at first then more confident as she gets into it

INT ARENA BASEMENT -- BENEATH THE COURT

Dylan races through the basement looking for the briefcase
Then she spots it hooked into some wires that snake up
into ceiling above
Dylan approaches it cautiously She slowly opens the top

DYLAN
(to herself)
Alright Dylan all we have to do is
figure out which wire to cut

REVEAL THE BOMB --

there are about fifty different wires in every color in
the Crayola box

DYLAN (CONTD)
Oh shit

INT COURTSIDE
Alex still searching for Charlie notices something strange

ALEX
Youre kidding me

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 98
NATALIE

is fully transformed on the court from wallflower to full-
out cheerleader Its not that shes as good as the other
cheerleaders Shes better

ON THE COURT

The SONG ends The Cheerleaders vacate the court but Natalie
keeps dancing her heart out She has 18000 fans watching
her and shes totally in the moment But theres another
agenda as well

COURTSIDE RADIO ANNOUNCER
The time out is over but one
cheerleader doesnt seem to notice
Officials cant start the clock again
while shes on the court
CUT TO
INT MIAMI ARENA -- CONTINUOUS

Dylan has picked two wires

DYLAN
Chartreuse and magenta This has
gotta be it

She prepares to snip them with her wire cutters

KNOX (0S)
I wouldnt do that if I were you

She spins to see Knox standing behind her

KNOX (CONTD)
See if you snip ANY of those wires
the bomb WILL blow up

DYLAN
Its gonna blow anyway once the
clock gets to zero

KNOX

Who told you that my idiotic
henchman Do you think I tell him
ANYTHING thats confidential

He holds up a small TRIGGERING DEVICE Its the s
we saw Pascal try to sell in the opening scene

KNOX (CONTD)
THIS is what triggers that bomb So
if youll kindly step away Ill
refrain from killing both of us

(
CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899

Realizing she has no choice Dylan stands up and

KNOX (CONTD)
In different circumstances Dylan I
think you and I could have worked out
We have a lot in common

DYLAN
Yeah I fall for assholes and you
ARE one
Knox laughs
KNOX

Good one
(beat as he backs up)

when

ame one

)

backs away
Well I must be going If you like
your body parts attached to your
torso I suggest you do the same

Knox turns to go but the other Angels are blocking his way

ALEX
Give it up Knox Youre surrounded

NATALIE
Give us the detonator

KNOX
NO

Stumbling backwards Knox holds it up high

KNOX (CONTD)
Ill blow this building sky high I swear

CHARLIE (0S)
Dont do it Eric Its me you want
not all these innocent people

Everyone turns as one to a figure emerging from the shadows

KNOX
Charlie

Thats right its Charlie Finally after all these years
we get a look at him and boy is it disappointing

Hes not what we expected Short portly dressed ina
Were 1 t-shirt the Angels are absolutely floored by
Charlies appearance

ANGELS
Charlie

Charlie ignores their stares and addresses Knox directly

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 100

CHARLIE
Your father was a double agent Eric
Yes I revealed him but he was killed
by his own people before we could
throw him in jail
(beat)
He was my friend

KNOX
Its still your fault you arrogant
prick You still killed my father

CHARLIE
Maybe Maybe I did But why should
YOU kill all these people If you
hate me so much just shoot ME
Just shoot me Eric

Charlie spreads his arms leaving Knox a plenty wide target

Its a horribly tense moment The Angels are frozen watching
Knox decide Charlies fate

Knox is sweating debating his choices Can he really do
this Charlies not the glamorous smug asshole he imagined
He starts lowering his gun

KNOX
Okay Youre right
(quickly)
Ill just kill you

BLAM

It all happens in the blink of an eye Knox fires hitting
Charlie in the chest Natalie leaps out and tackles Knox
Alex dives and grabs the detonator before it has a chance
to go off

Dylan runs to Charlies side

DYLAN
Charlie no NO

She hold shim in her arms as the other Angels gather round
their fallen leader He gasps for air

DYLAN (CONTD)
Hes trying to say something

Then Dylan notices something weird Hes not gasping for
air theres something stuck in his mouth

With a great hacking cough he spits it out Its a voice
chip like the one Dylan used in the opening scene

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 101

VOICE
Ucch that tasted terrible

The voice isnt Charlies Dylan reaches down and rips
off Charlies mask revealing

NATALIE
Bosley Are you okay

BOSLEY
Think so

He pulls back the padding from the suit revealing a small
wound where the bullet grazed his side

BOSLEY (CONTD)
Hurts but it looks like itll heel

Dylan laughs Alex ruffles his hair

DYLAN
Hey wait a second If Bosleys
here then wheres Charlie

The Angels all look at each other No one knows
EXT CENTER PASSAGE - DAY

In gorgeous SLOW MOTION the three angels walk side-by-side
with a calm assurance fireballs exploding behind them

They won

As MUSIC rises the ANGELS TRIPTYCH descends then peels
away to reveal

EXT GORGEOUS BEACH - DAY

The angels kick back on the white sands tropical drinks in-
hand Bosley is there as well with a grass hat and zinc
on his sniffer

Charlie is on the cellular speakerphone
CHARLIES VOICE
Great work angels Youll be happy
to know you received another

presidential commendation

The Angels and Bosley clink glasses
CHARLIES VOICE (CONTD)
Enjoy your vacation angels

THE ANGELS
Thank you Charlie
( )

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 102

They toast the speakerphone

CHARLIES VOICE
Alex Natalie -- I know youve been
putting in some long hours on this case
so I thought you might enjoy a chance to
catch up with some old friends

NATALIE AND ALEX TURN TO SEE
PETER AND JASON

walking across the beach towards them Each is carrying a
drink of his own They wave Damn those men look good

Alex and Natalie share a smile
DYLAN
Any chance youll be joining us
Charlie
CUT TO

A SUNNY DECK

Were in Charlies point-of-view We can see part of his
reflection in the window -- not enough to see his face
but we get some sense of the man

He turns away begins walking Steps down onto the sand

CHARLIE
(to cell phone)
Id love to Angels But I have some
precious treasures to watch over

With that he hangs up We stay in his POV walking
across the beach And its not just any beach

TO THE LEFT WE NOTICE
PETE AND JASON
approaching Were on the same beach

Looking right we see the backs of the Angels and Bosley
They have no idea that Charlie is walking right behind them

A beat then Dylan looks back

She looks directly as us -- at Charlie -- tracking as we
move past Does she somehow recognize its Charlie

From her reaction its not clear

A beat then we

CHARLIES ANGELS - 81899 103

REVERSE ANGLENOT POV

Dylan looks back forward again Did she just see Charlie
Her smile tells us she thinks she did

She raises a toast

DYLAN
To Charlie

THE ANGELS AND BOSLEY
To Charlie

They knock glasses

Right at the moment we should probably fade out Bosley
spills his icy drink in his lap His eyes go wide

The Angels just have to laugh
We FREEZE FRAME then
CuT TO BLACK

THE END
