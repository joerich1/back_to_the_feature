EXT STOOP OF MANHATTAN BROWNSTONE LATE FALL NIGHT 1

FRANCES PRICE 60 fashionable moneyed striking is
standing outside a pristine brownstone sliding on a pair of
gloves She stands with her son MALCOLM PRICE 27 wearing
an expensive suit but the shirt is half-tucked and the suit
is wrinkled as though he’s been wearing it for some days
The windows of the brownstone are illuminated and the sound
of a piano is on the air a tasteful party is occurring

FRANCES
All good things must end

She is speaking to the HOSTESS 65 likewise moneyed though
less lovely than Frances She is somewhat drunk

HOSTESS
(aggrieved)
But you’re certain you have to go

FRANCES
Yes and we’re very sorry about it
What a shame We were having such a
lovely evening

HOSTESS
Were you - really

FRANCES
Such a lovely evening And I do
hate to leave But it sounds like
we’ve got a proper emergency at
home And what can be done in the
face of that

HOSTESS
(sorrowfully)
Nothing

A pause Suddenly the Hostess lunges at Frances and embraces
her She whispers in Frances’s ear

HOSTESS (CONTD)
I’ve always admired you Frances

Frances is mortified but calm

FRANCES
Malcolm

HOSTESS
Actually I’m sort of afraid of
you Is that very silly of me

FRANCES
Malcolm Malcolm

Malcolm intervenes peeling the Hostess away from his mother
He takes her hand in his and shakes it The Hostess watches
her hand going up and down with an expression of puzzlement
A sudden embarrassment comes over her

HOSTESS
Excuse me I’m sorry

She moves back a step into her house

HOSTESS (CONTD)
Thank you for coming Good night

She returns to her home closing the door behind her Frances
and Malcolm walk down the steps where their driver opens the
door to their waiting town car Frances pulls out a gold
lighter and cigarette CLICK She lights the cigarette

The Hostess is now visible in a window chatting amiably with
one of her guests

FRANCES
Born to bore

MALCOLM
She’s just drunk Hopefully she
won’t remember in the morning

FRANCES
She’1l send flowers if she does

They pass their car and enter a-

EXT PARK NIGHT 1A

As they enter a vagrant DAN 50 eyes bright with alcohol
approaches and stands before Frances and Malcolm

DAN
Got anything to spare tonight
folks

Malcolm is leaning in to shoo the man away but Frances
catches his arm

FRANCES
Possibly we do But may we ask what
you need the money for
Blue DAN
Oh you know Just getting by

2A
FRANCES
Could you please be more specific

DAN
I guess I’d like a little wine if
you want to know

Frances nods appreciative of the frank reply

FRANCES
What’s your name
DAN
Dan
FRANCES
May I call you Daniel
DAN
If that’s what you want to do
sure
FRANCES

Daniel what would you do if we
gave you twenty dollars

Dan whistles a puff of dry air He squints realizing the

scenario in his mind

DAN
For twenty dollars I could get a
gallon of Three Roses a pack of
cigarettes and a weenie

FRANCES
And where would you take it all
Back to your room

DAN
The weenie I’d eat on the spot The
rest of it I’d take it into the
park with me That’s where I sleep
most nights in the park

FRANCES
Where in the park

DAN
Under a bush

Frances smiles sweetly at Dan
FRANCES
So you’d lay under a bush and smoke
your cigarettes and drink your
wine

DAN
Yeah

FRANCES
You’d look up at the stars

DAN
Why not

FRANCES
(thinks )
Would you really drink the entire
gallon Daniel

DAN
I really would

FRANCES
But wouldn’t you feel awful in the
morning

DAN
Yes but that’s what mornings are
for ma’am

Sufficiently touched Frances opens her clutch and fishes out
a twenty for Dan He receives the bill and scuttles away

A BEAT COP 35 walks up looking after Dan

BEAT COP
That guy wasn’t bothering you two
I hope

FRANCES

Who Daniel Not at all He’s a
friend of ours

BEAT COP
Looked like he was putting the bite
on you

Frances stares icily at the policeman

FRANCES
Actually I was paying him back I
should have paid him back a long
time ago but Dan’s been very
patient with me

FRANCES (CONTD)
I thank God for the fact of a man
like him Not that it’s any of your
business

She lights the lighter again CLICK The flame is positioned
between them as if defining a border

The Beat Cop looks at Frances then Malcolm They’re both
regarding him with disdain The Beat Cop shrugs and wanders
off asking sorry small questions to himself

Frances turns to Malcolm and claps her hands gently together
communicating a ‘job well done’ sentiment

FRANCES (CONTD)
Let’s

She wraps her hands around her son’s arm as they take a path
across the park a Manhattan skyline looming above

INT PRICE APARTMENT 2
SMALL FRANK an elderly cat walks through the lavish living
room apartment up a spiral staircase and down a long
hallway He enters

INT MALCOLM’S BEDROOM 3

Malcolm sits on his bed staring at his telephone He seems
nervous just to look at it

In the background Small Frank watches as Malcolm picks up
the phone and dials It goes to voice mail

Malcolm stands He moves toward the door as he speaks

MALCOLM
Hi Sudsy It’s me

He closes the door with his foot barring the lurking cat
MALCOLM (CONTD)
I haven’t seen you in awhile
Id like to see you Do you
want to see me

He shakes his head at his own awkwardness and hangs up

INT PRICE APARTMENT 4

Small Frank crosses the large well-appointed living room and
moves to stand in the doorway of -

FRANCES’S BEDROOM 5

Frances wears a plush robe She’s combing her long damp hair
- she’s just taken a bath and is talking on speakerphone in
front of a vanity mirror

FRANCES
It used to be that the seasons
filled me with expectation Now
they seem more a hostile
encroachment

JOAN (0S)
I thought we’d agreed not to talk
about death at night
(pause)
Christmas is coming I say it each
year but you’re hell to shop for

Frances notices something in a mirror’s reflection that
causes her to turn She and the cat stare at each other

FRANCES
I’m simple I want nothing

She shuts the door on the cat as Malcolm had

INT OFFICE LATER 6

Small Frank is watching the Wall Street wrap-up on
television

Frances is eating breakfast A MAID 40 refills her coffee
and exits as Malcolm enters He hasn’t changed clothes or
shaved

The maid brings him a plate of food and he begins shoveling
it into his mouth Frances watches him with a melancholic
endearment She lights a cigarette CLICK

FRANCES
Did you drink to the brink of sound
reasoning

MALCOLM

FRANCES
Were you driven to insomnia by the
violence of your Muse

Malcolm chewing shakes his head Frances reaches over and
lays a consoling hand atop his

Malcolm winces and shoots his mother a look She makes a
chaste face

FRANCES (CONTD)
How are things with Susan

MALCOLM
Were in our holding pattern As if
you didn’t know

Frances nods

FRANCES
Ah to be young-ish and in love-
ish
(takes a drag off
cigarette)
Will you see her today

Malcolms face registers annoyance he doesn’t like speaking
with his mother about Susan Frances takes pity pats his
hand
FRANCES (CONTD)
I can’t join you anyway Mr Baker
insists on a meeting

Malcolm’s face registers a minor concern

MALCOLM
Another plea for thrift

Frances seems uneasy at the question
FRANCES
Wait and see
INT PRICE APARTMENT VESTIBULE DAY 9
Frances is sitting in the library with MR BAKER a well-
heeled professional in his late 50’s He’s anxious but trying

to control it He plunges in headlong

MR BAKER
It’s all gone Frances

FRANCES
What’s all gone
MR BAKER
Everything

FRANCES
Everything

Mr Baker nods

FRANCES (CONTD)
Not the money in my account

MR BAKER
It’s not your account for long

FRANCES
It’s in my name

MR BAKER
The name you get to keep But every
penny in that account in addition
to the investments and properties
is going back to the bank

q

FRANCES
The properties

MR BAKER

The properties are yours I would
imagine until the end of the month
By that I mean you have use of
them But none of them can be sold
or rented and you’1l be locked out
on the first of January at the
latest

q

FRANCES
Certainly I’1l get to keep the
money I brought to the marriage

MR BAKER

That was shuffled into the estate a
long time ago and it wasn’t excuse
me a very large sum

FRANCES
And Malcolms legacy

MR BAKER
No

Frances looks lost fragile Mr Baker is peeved to be party
to the event
MR BAKER (CONTD)
I spoke to you about this as a
possibility for seven years and an
eventuality for three What did you
think was going to happen What was
your plan

FRANCES
(exhales)
My plan was to die before the money
ran out But I kept and keep not
dying and here I am

She takes a moment then sits up

Mr

Baker

FRANCES (CONTD)
All right It’s all been settled
Now I want you to tell me what to
do

MR BAKER

FRANCES
Yes Tell me please

MR BAKER
What can I say Take a loan from a
friend

FRANCES
Impossible Name something else

MR BAKER

EXT NYC UPPER EAST SIDE STREET - NIGHT 9A

Malcolm and Susan are walking up a busy block talking Susan
seems amusedincredulous about something

SUSAN
You went to museums alone five
hours a day five days a week - for
four years

MALCOLM
Yes

SUSAN
Instead of going to high school

They are passing the Ritz Malcolm is looking in the windows
as they pass Susan is focusing only on Malcolm

MALCOLM
Yes

SUSAN
And Frances was okay with this

He looks back at Susan

MALCOLM
It was her idea

They approach a curb wait to cross Susan is so distracted
by what she’s just heard she moves to step into the street
Malcolm gently prevents this

MALCOLM (CONTD)
Careful

Pause for a break in traffic Malcolm takes her hand as they
step into the crosswalk
Blue 10a

MALCOLM (CONTD)
‘Education by observation’ she
called it

Susan thinks

SUSAN
Weren’t you very lonely though

They step up a curb and continue down the sidewalk They
continue holding hands

MALCOLM
I was until I wasn’t

Susan squeezes his arm and beams at him She loves him He
smiles back a tender moment as they continue up the block

But they’re getting nearer to Malcolm’s apartment building
Susan sees it in the distance

SUSAN
Malcolm

Malcolm turns to look at her

SUSAN (CONTD)
What if we went to Frances and told
her about our engagement You know
together

MALCOLM
What - you and me

SUSAN
Together yes

MALCOLM
When

SUSAN
Now

Malcolm looks at the apartment as they walk He takes his
hand back from Susan and crosses his arms

MALCOLM
Talk to my mother together - now

Malcolm considers it He shakes his head and looks at Susan

MALCOLM (CONTD)

Blue 10B

SUSAN
Why

MALCOLM
It’s a bad idea The only way it’1l
work is if I tell her myself

Susan takes a step away from Malcolm and studies him
critically

SUSAN
What exactly are you afraid of

MALCOLM
The same thing you’re afraid of

They both look up at the apartment

INT PRICE APARTMENT KITCHEN NIGHT

Frances is standing in the kitchen sharpening a knife in the

dark She works evenly methodically muttering lowly to
herself She is drunk

SOUND OF home door openingclosing Hallway light goes on

Malcolm enters the kitchen still wearing his outside coat

has something weighing on him he takes a breath begins

MALCOLM
Listen there’s something we need
to talk about--

He regards his mother confusedly

MALCOLM (CONTD)
Are you cooking

FRANCES
No I just like the sound it makes

She stops looks up

FRANCES (CONTD)
What is it

MALCOLM

We’re insolvent We’ve nothing

She laughs dementedly slashing at the air with the knife It
comes away from her hand and clatters down the length of the
kitchen table and onto the floor

Malcolm unnerved leaves Frances collects the knife and
resumes her work of sharpening the blade

INT PRICE APARTMENT DAY 11

RALPH RUDY 55 a swarthy somewhat sleazy man in an ill-
fitting suit walks around the house inspecting the
paintings and sculpture and taking notes in a pad with a
pencil stub so small it’s not visible in his meaty hand
France follows behind holding her finger to her temple her
head aching from the night before

FRANCES
Do you understand the nature
of my situation The delicacy of
it I mean

Ralph Rudy nods curtly He has no thought to put Frances at
ease

RALPH RUDY
About my fee

Frances raises her eyebrows Yes
RALPH RUDY (CONTD)

It’s a straight 30 percent That’s
non-negotiable

FRANCES
Isnt it

RALPH RUDY
No

FRANCES

Mightn’t it be Well it’s going to
have to be if you want to work with
me

This gives Ralph Rudy pause He looks at Frances as if for
the first time and in studying her eyes recognizes his
underestimation

RALPH RUDY
Twenty-seven percent
FRANCES
I’1ll give you fifteen percent or
I’1l thank you for your time

RALPH RUDY
Twenty-five percent

FRANCES

Mr Rudy if you name another
figure that isn’t fifteen percent
Ill go to fourteen Name another
I go to thirteen and on down the
line until your payment and your
sole function in regard to my life
disappears altogether

RALPH RUDY
(frowns )
That’s no way to negotiate This is
a tricky job It could be
detrimental to my reputation

FRANCES
Reputation That’s humorous
RALPH RUDY
Is that right
FRANCES
Yes it is
RALPH RUDY
And why
FRANCES

Because I saw the condition of your
vehicle when you pulled up Because
the vehicle wore New Jersey plates
Because your socks while coming
close don’t quite match And
because and because and because
There’s no need to insult each
other Mr Rudy I have a somewhat
dirty job that needs doing and you
are a somewhat dirty person You
seem to think you have me over a
barrel but I’ve other options
youre not taking into
consideration

Frances clasps her hands together She is enjoying herself
RALPH RUDY
There’s no one in North America
with my contacts

FRANCES
I don’t doubt that But you miss my
point

Frances pauses

FRANCES (CONTD)
Have you heard any rumors in
respects to my mental health

RALPH RUDY
No
(pause)
I heard youre odd

FRANCES
Odd

RALPH RUDY
Odd yes Difficult

FRANCES
Difficult

RALPH RUDY
And there’s the story about your
husband

Frances raises her eyebrows

FRANCES
Which story is that

RALPH RUDY
You know About you finding
him

FRANCES
Yes

Ralph Rudy is uncomfortable

RALPH RUDY
You know

Frances’s face brightens as if the answer’s just come to

mind

FRANCES
I found him but then I left the
body for a while didn’t I

There’s something self-consciously ‘naughty’ about her tone
Ralph Rudy nods grimly

FRANCES (CONTD)
And people still talk about that

RALPH RUDY
Sure they do Of course

Frances shakes her head and laughs to herself She leans in
closer to Ralph Rudy

FRANCES
Well I’m going to tell you a
private truth now I’m more than
odd There’s a goodly part of me
that wants to set this building on
fire with myself and my son locked
in What do you think of that

Ralph Rudy looks suddenly adrift out of his depth

RALPH RUDY
That’s none of my business

FRANCES
I say it is Because if I don’t get
my price this goodly part will
become ever more goodly It’s
important that you understand my
point of view and appreciate both
the fact and scope of my nihilism
Now you and I know that many of
the objects in my house are of a
museum quality My effects
represent a small fortune Fifteen
percent of that even in a rushed
hushed sale Think of how many
socks that would buy

Ralph Rudy’s eyelids drop and he becomes pensive
FRANCES (CONTD)
Now let’s walk together not

speaking to the front door

They move wordlessly to the vestibule Ralph Rudy turns at
the door He offers Frances his hand

RALPH RUDY
Fifteen percent

Frances nods and shakes his hand
FRANCES
That’s very good Mr Rudy I’1ll be

in touch

Ralph Rudy is smiling at Frances He is impressed with her
he likes her

RALPH RUDY
Why don’t you call me Ralph

FRANCES
I’11 call you Mr Rudy

She closes the door on him He wears an expression of
befuddlement on his face
INT NY RESTAURANT DAY 12

Frances is eating brunch with Joan

FRANCES

Are they saying I’m broke
JOAN

They are Are you Talk to old

Joan

Frances nods slowly Joan ponders She bites into a piece of
celery from her Bloody Mary

JOAN (CONTD)
A plan is coming to me

Frances sits silently waiting

JOAN (CONTD)
Possibly it’s idiotic I don’t
know The more options the better
though right

Frances continues silently waiting

JOAN (CONTD)
What about my apartment in Paris I
haven’t even been in a year at
least And it’s just sitting there
Blue 16

Frances’s expression describes sorrow then resignation Joan
reaches over and squeezes her hand

JOAN (CONTD)
To get out of New York is the
thing honey It’s only sensible

FRANCES
Sensible

JOAN
Sensible

FRANCES

Sensible

Frances takes a drink of her Bloody Mary The check is placed
on the table and both women reach for it

JOAN
Let me get it

FRANCES
No

JOAN
Frances

They pull it back and forth They begin to laugh at the
ridiculousness of the situation But Frances’s laughter
diminishes and her face becomes more solemn

She lets go of the check giving it to Joan
JOAN (CONTD)
Thank you

her checkbook and uncaps a pen

SYLVIA (CONTD)

Malcolm moves toward Sylvia He pulls out his wallet

MALCOLM

Six hundred

Malcolm hands her six bills

SYLVIA (CONTD)
Thanks Malcolm

Sylvia leaves the room Frances only now comes away from her
reverie she looks at her watch then at Malcolm

FRANCES
There’s been a change in plans
pal

MALCOLM

Oh I didn’t know there was a plan
to change in the first place

FRANCES
Yes well It’s been decided we’re
going to go to Paris

rest of our lives

Malcolm watches his mother

INT NY MIDTOWN DINER LUNCH 14

Susan sits in a booth alone looking out the window at the
people walking by A rainstorm has just passed and the
streets and store windows are wet

Malcolm enters the restaurant wet through to the skin He is
holding a flower in his hand He sits opposite Susan and
hands her the flower She accepts it

Malcolm unfolds his napkin and begins patting his hair Susan
studies him as he does this She smiles at him she reaches
over and lovingly touches his face

She pulls her hand back

SUSAN
So what can I do for you Malcolm

Malcolm cocks his head

MALCOLM
Do

SUSAN
Do
(nods )
Youve called me here today What
have you got to report

Malcolm shifts uncomfortably Susan folds her hands Her tone
describes patience wearing thin

SUSAN (CONTD)
The thing I can’t figure out is
whether or not you expect me or if
you even want me to wait for you

MALCOLM
Of course I do But it wouldn’t be
very chivalrous to ask would it

SUSAN
And chivalry - is that an interest
of yours

Here Malcolm lays the napkin over his head totally obscuring
his face

MALCOLM
I have many interests

SUSAN
Would you describe yourself as a
coward

MALCOLM

SUSAN
How would you describe yourself

MALCOLM
I don’t know that I’d bother in the
first place

Susan pulls the napkin away from Malcolm’s head and studies
his face

SUSAN

I want you to know that I’m trying
to fall out of love with you

Malcolm’s mouth creaks open

MALCOLM
Susan

SUSAN
What

MALCOLM

I’m going to Paris

SUSAN
Paris

Malcolm nods

SUSAN (CONTD)
When are you going to Paris

MALCOLM
Soon

SUSAN
How soon

MALCOLM

I think tomorrow

SUSAN
You think tomorrow

Susan watches Malcolm awhile

SUSAN (CONTD)
When are you coming back

MALCOLM
That’s the thing I don’t really
know
Pink 20

A long pause
They continue staring at each other

The answer is clear but Malcolm can’t say it aloud Susan
shakes her head she laughs bitterly

SUSAN
Well it’s all very moving I’m
sure

MALCOLM
What

SUSAN

Your devotion to a woman who didn’t
hardly introduce herself to you
until you were twelve years old
Your refusal to live beyond the
rules she’s written for her own
benefit

She holds up the flower
SUSAN (CONTD)
You don’t bring flowers to someone
you’re saying goodbye to Malcolm
She hands him the flower

SUSAN (CONTD)
Please leave me alone

Malcolm pauses stands leaves the restaurant

We soon see him across the street The rain has stopped
bright sun emerges

He is watching Susan the flower in his hand

His sunglasses are crooked and steam is rising from his damp
shoulders

over the ocean - the boat is in motion Malcolm is already
sea-sick He lays in his bed a bowl on his chest Frances
sits at his bedside with a ‘tropical’ drink in her hand
Small Frank sits beside her

FRANCES (CONTD)
We tell ourselves we knew on a
psychic level they were going to
die but I didn’t know no Joan was
the one to tell me and it’s true I
cried but it felt forced and later
I lay awake surprised at how little
I cared It’s a shame he died that
way but I’m glad we never married
He wanted to tamp my spirit and
might have succeeded But he was a
beautiful boy - beautiful

Malcolm sits up and heaves into the bowl but nothing comes
He lays back down

I ran from one brightly burning
disaster to the next

knife and I thought Who could ever

MALCOLM
I can’t imagine cupcakes at Tavern
on the Green

FRANCES

That’s a banal observation
Malcolm but just to see the
thought through yes they did for
a time serve chocolate cupcakes at
Tavern on the Green He was nervous
but hid it admirably I liked that
he wasn’t afraid of silence

Frances becomes silent herself

MALCOLM
Keep talking about him

FRANCES
I don’t want to

MALCOLM
But did you love him

Frances is surprised by the question She considers

Frank who hangs limply in his hands and walks off with him
Frances watches them go Soon she follows after them

Malcolm reaches over for his mother’s drink and takes a sip
He takes in the band the dance floor He spies the Elderly
Woman whod been crying in the Tarot Tent She is marching
through the audience in a pink gown tossing handfuls of
confetti over the heads of the people on the dance floor She
looks perfectly enchanted to be doing this as though this
was all she ever wanted from life The crowd eats her up but
confetti blasts can still be seen from time to time

Malcolm is fishing a cherry from the bottom of his mother’s
drink He spies Madeleine the medium at the bar He hails her
and approaches a critical look on her face

MALCOLM
I’m Malcolm

She does not respond

MALCOLM (CONTD)
Will you tell me your name

MADELEINE THE MEDIUM
Madeleine

MALCOLM
Madeleine will you have a drink
with me

MADELEINE THE MEDIUM

MALCOLM
Just one drink Madeleine

MADELEINE THE MEDIUM
No

Frances returns Small Frank in her arms At the sight of the
cat Madeleine’s attitude changes completely She drops to a
knee and holds Small Frank’s head in her hands looking
deeply into his eyes

FRANCES
(to Malcolm)
Who is this person

MALCOLM
Madeleine the Medium

FRANCES
What’s she doing

MADELEINE THE MEDIUM
Sorry
(points to the cat)
Do you not know

FRANCES
We know
(to Malcolm)
Were going to lie down Will you
come visit us later

Malcolm nods Frances takes up Small Frank’s paw and makes
him salute Madeleine sits beside Malcolm watching Frances
as she departs

MADELEINE THE MEDIUM
What’s she paying you
Blue MALCOLM
Paying me

MADELEINE THE MEDIUM
Aren’t you her gigolo

MALCOLM
(horrified)
Oh my God That’s my mother

Madeleine holds up a hand
MADELEINE THE MEDIUM
Excuse me But you’d be surprised

at how common it is

The Elderly Woman dances past them Malcolm studies
Madeleine’s reaction She only looks grim

MALCOLM
What was she so upset about before
MADELEINE THE MEDIUM
A third of the people on board this
ship are in the presence of death
But if I say a single word about
it Off I go

MALCOLM
You told that woman she’s dying

MADELEINE THE MEDIUM
Yes because she is

The Elderly Woman tosses yet another grip of confetti

MALCOLM
She looks all right to me

MADELEINE THE MEDIUM
She’1ll never see land again

The Waiter approaches

INT FRANCES’S CABIN SAME TIME 26

Frances is in her bed in an indigo robe hair upswept
regarding her reflection in a palm mirror Small Frank is
sitting upright before her and listening with what could be
interpreted as interest

FRANCES
It’s like a retirement in a way
(pause)
Though no I’ve never worked a
day and so what mantle is being
retired even
She shrugs She lowers her hand mirror and studies the cat
FRANCES (CONTD)
I’m not sure how we’re going to get
you into France
She raises her hand mirror and pats her chin

She lowers the mirror and clicks the light off

INT DINING HALL CAPTAIN’S TABLE DUSK 29

A large table filled with well-dressed men and women At the
head of the table is the Captain middle 60’s traditionally

handsome full head of silver hair He is staring fixedly at

Frances obviously enamored of her She is unaware of him or
else ignoring him He leans in and addresses her

CAPTAIN
I understand you’re moving to
Paris Are you very excited

FRANCES
I suppose I should be

CAPTAIN
I admire you for carving out a
second act for yourself
(raises his glass)
Bravo

FRANCES
Thank you But it’s the third act
if we’re to be honest Or the coda
if you’d rather

CAPTAIN
And your son is coming with you
isn’t that right

FRANCES
Of course

CAPTAIN
I find it refreshing to see a child
so devote I was close to my mother

too

FRANCES
I despised mine

CAPTAIN
Did you

FRANCES
Despised

CAPTAIN

The burden of motherhood can be a
strain
Pink 29a

FRANCES
She was a demon And if such a
place as hell exists then that’s
where she collects her mail

The captain is unsure of how to respond Another drink for
Frances is delivered

FRANCES (CONTD)
Is it true that it’s five miles to
the bottom of the ocean

The Captain all but jumps up to answer the nautical question

CAPTAIN
At its deepest it’s shy of that
but only just We’re talking about
the Mariana Trench here That’s in
the Western Pacific - long ways
away from us Five miles in an
uncommon depth however Where we
are now it’s more along the line of
two mile

The news is a balm for Frances She finishes her martini

Malcolm at the other end of the table is spying on the
person to his left BORIS MAURUS is a 55 year-old alcoholic
in an ill fitting and woefully wrinkled linen suit He is
copiously sweating and his face is the color of rare beef He
looks unhappy A tequila is fitted into his hand

Malcolm nudges him the man flinches

BORIS MAURUS
What

MALCOLM
I’m Malcolm Price

BORIS MAURUS
Good for you I’m Boris Maurus

MALCOLM
Your name is Boris Maurus

BORIS MAURUS
Yeah

Malcolm thinks

MALCOLM
We both have horror movie names

Boris Maurus takes a drink issues a small gasp

BORIS MAURUS
Yeah Well I wouldn’t know
because I don’t watch horror
movies because my life is already
a horror movie so what’s the
point

MALCOLM
Okay

BORIS MAURUS
I watch documentaries

MALCOLM
All right

Malcolm studies the man He seems very agitated

MALCOLM (CONTD)
Are you all right

Boris Maurus sighs nods - yes something’s the matter

BORIS MAURUS
I’m the ship’s doctor right

MALCOLM
Right

BORIS MAURUS
Well yesterday some moron posing
as a gypsy told one of the
passengers she was dying which is
bad enough but then the woman
really did die

MALCOLM
You mean Madeleine
BORIS MAURUS
The gypsy I think that’s her name
You know her

Malcolm nods

BORIS MAURUS (CONTD)
Yeah well they just threw her in

MALCOLM
Can they do that

BORIS MAURUS

Goddamned right they can A
middling lawyer could prove your
buddy murdered that woman Threat
of violence leading to cardiac
arrest

These old birds spook to say ‘Boo’
at them Once Death’s on deck In a
contained environment They freak
fucking out I’ve seen it It’s
grim

Boris Maurus finishes his tequila

BORIS MAURUS (CONTD)
(leans in whispers)

I could show you something very
terrible if you’d like

The Captain is leaning in close to Frances his hand rests
atop hers they are flirting

Frances takes a drink She is pleased by the Captain’s
attentions

FRANCES
Out of the blue and I feel so

happy

Maybe people don’t want to know

Of course they want to know
Wouldn’t you want to

Madeleine behind The CUSTOMS AGENT is 50 parted black hair
thin moustache - very French looking

What is the purpose of your trip

Frances throws an elbow atop the counter her head cocked at
a jaunty angle

Chasing after youthful fantasies

Madame

FRANCES
We’re vacationists I want to see
the Eiffel Tower then die

The Customs Agent pauses shakes his head
CUSTOMS AGENT

Die But you are not so old

I’m old enough to have received a
corsage by a white-gloved West
Point cadet with a pomaded ducktail
and a solid silver flask of rye in
the pocket of his gabardine tuxedo -
that’s how old I am

Frances snaps her fingers once for emphasis or punctuation
The Customs Agent flummoxed turns to Malcolm who is
watching Madeleine depart

CUSTOMS AGENT
She is sick monsieur

She does not die

Malcolm sighs stands approaches

RUDE WAITER
(in English)
Yes soon buddy soon

Malcolm returns to the table and watches as the waiter walks
across the restaurant and to the sidewalk Looking in at
Frances he ceremoniously lights a cigarette and takes a deep
drag Frances and the waiter stare at each other

Finally Frances breaks the gaze and begins calmly rooting
around in her purse

She pulls out a bottle of perfume and begins spritzing the
floral arrangement in the center of their table

Malcolm smiles at his mother he knows what she’s doing The
waiter however is mystified He drops his cigarette and
watches her suspiciously As she pulls out a lighter he
becomes alarmed She lights the lighter CLICK and holds it
up for the Rude Waiter to see

Frances touches the flame to the perfume-soaked flowers and
it goes up in a great flaming ball WHOMP

The Rude Waiter rushes in to stand before the blaze He has
completely lost his cool

Malcolm sits at the kitchen table drinking one of the
bottles of wine from a case with a bow on it - he’s bought
the wine for his mother

The door opens and Frances enters pushing a new bicycle She
is exhausted from pushing it up the stairs

FRANCES
Come and get it away from me

confused by the present it’s certainly not something he
would have purchased for himself

MALCOLM
I can’t imagine you two on a
honeymoon
FRANCES
He’d never been and I insisted
(pause)

It was all the normal things
Hotels and flowers and champagne
It’s strange to think he was
actually fun but in the beginning
he really was

She pauses and recalls the honeymoon

FRANCES (CONTD)
We were at the Luxembourg Garden
and he was sailing one of those
little boats following after it
with the long stick you know I
started feeding the carp bits of a
hot dog I was eating They went
berserk for it And there was
something about all these
grotesquely fat fish piling on top
of one another -- and for a hot
dog It made me laugh hard

(MORE)

Pink 43

FRANCES (CONTD)
I think your father was startled by
it Well he went away and came
back with six hot dogs

She looks at Malcolm

FRANCES (CONTD)
He’d bought them because he wanted
to make me laugh again Do you
understand

Such a small gesture But it
couldn’t have been farther away
from the man I knew later The man
he became

After I realized our friends were
actually his and that not only did
I not like them but they didn’t
like me either Not a word since
the funeral I don’t miss them
particularly but I miss the noise
they made That’s why I invited you
over

You want us to make noise

I’m lonely

Frances all but rolls her eyes

FRANCES
Howd he die

MME REYNARD
He choked to death

FRANCES
That’s a new one

MME REYNARD
It was a very ugly thing

France scoffs and sips her martini

MME REYNARD (CONTD)
Please don’t be cruel to me It was
difficult to get up the nerve to
ask you over

FRANCES
I suppose I don’t see why we’re
here is all

MME REYNARD
Just that I was curious to meet
you Of course I know who you are
I grew up in New York City and
we’re the same age about We all
thought you were so wonderful my
friends and I

FRANCES
I see

MME REYNARD
So wonderful And so when I heard
youd come to Paris I thought we
might become friends

FRANCES
I appreciate that But the fact is
that I’ve no need of friends in my
life at the moment

MME REYNARD
Well I’m sorry to hear that that’s
the way you feel But you’re here
now and I’ve made a cassoulet and
I vote we make the best of it What
do you think Malcolm Shall we
make the best of it

Malcolm feels sorry for Mme Reynard

MALCOLM

MME REYNARD
Do you know he died in that very
chair

Frances grips the arms of the chair

FRANCES
And what may I ask did he choke
on

MME REYNARD
Ah lamb

FRANCES
And have you eaten lamb since

MME REYNARD
No but you know I never liked lamb
much in the first place

FRANCES
I don’t either The gamy meats
somehow summon the fact of the
animal’s existence which puts me
in mind of its death

MME REYNARD
Id never thought of it before

FRANCES
Whereas a steak is simply a steak

MME REYNARD
Yes that’s right

Malcolm is bored he stands and leaves the room

INT MME REYNARD’S APARTMENT KITCHEN 53

She leaves Malcolm leans over to speak lowly to his mother

MALCOLM
Go look in the freezer

MALCOLM
Go look

Frances stands and leaves the room She returns a faraway
expression on her face She shrugs

FRANCES
I’ve never understood them

MALCOLM
What’s to understand

FRANCES
Is it something one uses alone or
with someone there to help

MALCOLM
Either or

FRANCES
(taps chin)
But why would you want it cold

MALCOLM
That’s the mystery

Frances takes a thoughtful sip of her martini Mme Reynard
enters She stumbles slightly getting into her chair

MME REYNARD
I’m a little bit crocked I think
Malcolm would you mind serving the
cassoulet

Malcolm stands to go

MME REYNARD (CONTD)

myself if I try It’s all ready for
you in the kitchen

He exits and Mme Reynard takes a drink

MME REYNARD (CONTD)
It becomes like water doesn’t it

FRANCES
It’s better than water

Mme Reynard smiles She feels so pleased that her night has
repaired itself A thought comes into her head

MME REYNARD
May I share a recollection I have
of you

FRANCES
All right

MME REYNARD

It must have been twenty years ago
It was in the months after your
husband’s death I was eating with
a group at Le Circe and a man at
my table had had dealings with your
husband and was not at all enamored
of him He’d actually been speaking
poorly of him when you came in

Mme Reynard smiles

MME REYNARD (CONTD)
You looked so smart we couldn’t
help but stare As you passed the
table the man stopped you and
said ‘Mrs Price I knew your
husband well And it’s all I can do
not to dance on his grave’

(pause)

Do you remember it

FRANCES
I don’t no What did I say to him

MME REYNARD
That was the thing You didn’t say
a word You drank his drink

Frances nods She can remember now distantly

MME REYNARD (CONTD)
Straight scotch You drank it down
in a gulp and stared at him with a
look of absolute indifference The
poor man didn’t know what to do he
was so ashamed

The women are smiling at each other
FRANCES
I’m sorry I was rude before My
life has fallen completely to
pieces and I’m upset about it

MME REYNARD
I know just what you mean

Yes I think you do

call here At least not fora
while I’ve been feeling better in
the last couple weeks and I’d
appreciate your keeping some

German tourists sit huddled together waiting for the lock to
drain that they can continue on

Frances is speaking with Small Frank The cat is trying to
get away from her but she holds him fast

FRANCES
Wait I know Think about what I’m
saying to you though As if it
wasn’t correct
(pause)
What do you propose we do once the
money’s gone

Malcolm enters the apartment Frances looks up at him At
this moment Small Frank rears and BITES her hard on the
hand She recoils The cat dashes for the open door and
disappears down the stairwell

She sits there holding her hand and watching Malcolm with a
crazy look on her face

INT JOAN’S APARTMENT BATHROOM 65

Malcolm is attending to Frances’s injury Frances stands
beside him hand still clamped to her breast staring into
the middle distance

The bathroom sink is full Malcolm delivers his mother’s hand
to the water and gently washes it with antibacterial soap He
wets a cotton ball with hydrogen peroxide and presses this to
her wounds Frances speaks without looking at Malcolm

FRANCES
Is he back yet

MALCOLM
No

He dries her hand and wraps it in gauze

MALCOLM (CONTD)
Does that hurt

FRANCES

MALCOLM
Thank you

She looks at him quizzically

FRANCES
What are you thanking me for

EXT PARK NIGHT 66

Frances hand bandaged walks alertly looking up and down
each street and alleyway searching for Small Frank She
still seems unhinged Malcolm trails behind her watching her
uneasily

INT JOAN’S APARTMENT MORNING 67

Mme Reynard sits with Malcolm and Frances She is pouring
orange juice atop a half-glass of fizzing champagne

Malcolm is still uneasy Frances scratches absently at her
bandage

MME REYNARD
Perhaps you could take Small
Frank’s departure as a signal to
welcome another animal into your
lives

She takes a sip Frances begins shaking her head no

MME REYNARD (CONTD)
A kitten is an agent of great good

Frances continues shaking her head

FRANCES
I didn’t want a cat in the first
place I don’t like cats It was
only that Small Frank impressed
himself upon us and there was
nothing to do but endure him

MME REYNARD
All right but if you feel that
way and now that he’s run off
can’t you simply let him go

FRANCES
No

A pause Frances begins to silently weep She stands and
leaves the room Malcolm pours himself a mimosa

MME REYNARD
I’ve upset your mother

MALCOLM
She’s upset in the general sense

He holds up the bottle

MALCOLM (CONTD)
We’re out of champagne

Mme Reynard nods thoughtfully as though Malcolm has just
said something profound

MME REYNARD
Do you ever feel that adulthood was
thrust upon you at too young an
age and that you are still
essentially a child mimicking the
behaviors of the grown ups all
around you in hopes they won’t
uncover the meagre contents of your
heart

Malcolm ponders this He is opening his mouth to answer when
Frances re-enters the room energized by an idea

FRANCES
The witch you fucked on the boat

Frances is explaining herself as Malcolm pops a bottle

FRANCES
Malcolm fucked a witch on the boat

Mme Reynard pats Malcolm’s knee and holds her empty glass
out Malcolm fills it

FRANCES (CONTD)
(to Malcolm)
She understood him didn’t she

MALCOLM
I think she did

FRANCES
Well why can’t we ask her where he
is

MALCOLM

I don’t know that she’d know And I
don’t know how we’d find her
either

Mme Reynard is listening patiently But she is confused

MME REYNARD
I would like for one of you to
explain to me just what it is
youre talking about please

FRANCES
The fucked witch and Small Frank
were connected

MALCOLM
Let’s not call her that

FRANCES
She understood about him

MME REYNARD
Yes But what is there to
understand about Small Frank
exactly I’m puzzled and this is
what’s puzzling me

Frances looks to Malcolm with a Should I Tell Her expression
Malcolm shrugs Why not

FRANCES
It’s not something we typically
discuss But the long and short of
it is that my dead husband lives
inside that cat

Mme Reynard’s faces twitches slightly

MME REYNARD
Is that a fact

FRANCES
An unfortunate fact

MME REYNARD
And how do you know this

FRANCES
It’s an understood thing

MME REYNARD
Can you make it understood to me

FRANCES
I don’t know I wish you’d be good
and take my word for it

MME REYNARD
(bravely)
Ill try

Frances once more stares into space

FRANCES
Frank ran away because I told him
something he didn’t like

MME REYNARD
And what was that

Frances pauses shakes her head She looks at Malcolm

FRANCES
I’m sorry but I choose not to say
Anyway I believe she might be able
to help and that we should seek
her out

MME REYNARD
Seek out the fucked witch

FRANCES
That’s right

MALCOLM
Let’s think of something else to
call her besides that

FRANCES
(sitting back)
How might we find her is the
question

The three of them consider it

MME REYNARD
I’ve got it

Jumping to her feet she knocks the crown of her skull on the
low iron lamp hanging above the coffee table She drops back
onto the sofa holding her head her eyes shut in pain

FRANCES
None whatsoever

My son knows her carnally

Mme Reynard begins choking She stands and hurries from the
room and to the bathroom There comes the sound of gurgling
She begins humming to herself

JULIUS
It can be helpful for me to
understand the nature of your
desire to find this person

FRANCES
Yes All right well we’ve lost
our cat

JULIUS
Yes

FRANCES

And this woman we believe might
be of assistance in locating him

JULIUS
She knows the cat’s whereabouts

Not at the moment no But it’s
come to our attention that this
woman can speak to the cat in her

Frances is drinking coffee Across the road she sees two
SCHOOL GIRLS 15 in private school clothes They share an
elaborate farewell They shake right then left hands they
simultaneously curtsy then cheek-kiss They are smiling as
they perform the movements It’s a routine a tradition
Frances watches this with a fond wistful expression

She begins to write on a postcard

FRANCES (VO)
I saw a man’s penis yesterday He
was pissing in the park opposite
the apartment Have you noticed men
simply take them out and use them
here No harm in it I suppose but
it takes some getting used to
Yesterday’s was memorably large
What a gift that must be for a man
What a lottery life is It was nice
to see it I’ll admit Oh Joan
When the money runs out I’m going
to kill myself but I want you to
know that you were the only one
other than Frank when he was
himself and Malcolm Please will
you take care of him if you can
somehow I’ve always admired your
heart Your heart is the rightest
of all

into a square and sticks it under her coffee cup She leaves

this he looks up at Frances in the distance

Malcolm makes an odd face He clears his throat He speaks
slowly but with mounting anguish

MALCOLM
I guess what I really mean to say
Dad is I don’t know that it’s
fair for you to ask me to weigh in
on something so personal as this
considering the fact that I don’t
know who you are have never known
who you are and not because I
didn’t want to but because you
never so much as parted the curtain
for me never showed me the
slightest preference or kindness
even as a child when I worshipped
you and all I ever wished for was
for you to take me by the hand and
walk me through any motherfucking
park pat me on the fucking head
for Christ’s sake was I that
repellent a creature to you

It smashes off the wall and he leaves the living room for his
bedroom slamming the door behind him

I’ve been neither lucky nor
unlucky I’ve been luckless - such
a bore

FRANCES
I’ve been incredibly lucky at
times but tragically unlucky at
others

MADELEINE THE MEDIUM
I’ve only been unlucky but I have a
sense this’ll change at some point
suddenly and permanently Anyway
that’s what I tell myself

JULIUS
I’ve only been unlucky and I
believe I’1ll always be

A thoughtful pause Some in the group sip from their drinks

INT JOAN’S LIVING ROOM LATE 93

Susan has laid out her mattress Tom regards it

TOM
It’s not big enough for the two of
us
She crosses her arms
SUSAN

No it’s not
She looks at him with an expression of tough luck

On the couch Mme Reynard and Julius are getting ready for
bed

MME REYNARD
I talk in my sleep

JULIUS
That’s all right

MME REYNARD
Also I gnash my teeth

JULIUS
All right

MME REYNARD
And I have sleep apnea and
sometimes I sleepwalk If you see
me set out to wander you mustn’t
wake me But if I try to leave the
apartment will you guide me back
around

JULIUS
Okay

She pauses
MME REYNARD
Occasionally I suffer from

JULIUS
What’s nightsickness

MME REYNARD
I sometimes - rarely - vomit the

JULIUS
Sweet dreams Mme Reynard

FRANCES
It’s a needed thing

JOAN
Three bottles of saffron

FRANCES
We’ll use it later or sooner

reads 15 hundred euro -- and rising Joan is concerned

JOAN
Oh let me pick this up

Frances has the cash in her hand She watches the number as
it rises

FRANCES
No it’s all budgeted out

JOAN
Dutch then
FRANCES
No I have to spend it all
A pause
JOAN
Why
FRANCES

Youre supposed to spend it all
That’s the object of the game

Frances is watching as the number rises up higher higher

Suddenly she relaxes It’s all gone She exhales she’s
relieved

She hands over all her cash to the Checker She drops her
remaining change into the penny jar

FRANCES (CONTD)
We’re going to need these
delivered is that all right

CHECKER (0S)

Joan watches her friend with concern

EXT PARIS PARK AFTERNOON 99

Frances and Joan are walking through a park in the golden
afternoon sun They pass a couple kissing in the grass
Frances nudges Joan they both smirk and smile

FRANCES
Do you and Don still make love

JOAN
Every year on his birthday

FRANCES
But not your birthday

JOAN
Just a nice dinner for me thanks

Frances lights a cigarette with her gold lighter click

FRANCES
Do you ever regret not having
children

JOAN
Never once Do you ever regret
having one

Frances smiles as though it’s a joke

JOAN (CONTD)
I’m being serious

FRANCES
Oh Well sometimes I do to be
honest
JOAN
But you wouldn’t change him
FRANCES
Yes I would
JOAN
But you wouldn’t change him much
FRANCES
Id change him quite a bit
JOAN
But you love him
FRANCES
(lays her palm to her
heart)

So much that it pains me

Joan reaches for Frances’s cigarette takes a drag hands it
back She’s smiling

JOAN
I told Don I had to run to Paris
because I thought you were going to
kill yourself He was fiddling with
the remote and he told me ‘Tell
her hello if you get there in
time’

Frances smiles Joan takes another drag of the cigarette

JOAN (CONTD)
I had a moment earlier this year
where I realized that I am at the
base of it happy

(MORE)

JOAN (CONTD)
and that Don and I have fulfilled
what we set out to fulfill for each
other Can you understand how
startling this was for me

FRANCES
Startling because you shouldn’t be
satisfied with what you’ve got

Joan shakes her head She thinks a moment

JOAN
You get older and you don’t even
want love Not the love we believed
in when we were young Who has the
energy for that I mean when I
think of the way we used to carry
on about it

FRANCES
I know

JOAN
Men and women throwing themselves
out of windows

(pause)

What you want is to know someone’s
there but you also want them to
leave you alone I’ve got that with
Don But I was startled because I
suddenly understood that the heart
takes care of itself We allow
ourselves contentment our heart
brings us ease in its good time

Frances keeps a blank expression

FRANCES
It’s a nice thought

JOAN
You don’t agree with me

Frances flicks her cigarette away
FRANCES
It hasn’t been that way for me
100 EXT TUILERIES GARDEN BENCH SOON AFTER 100

JOAN
I’m sorry

They are sitting on a bench in the park drinking hot
chocolate Joan looks at Frances in a sidelong way Frances
looks back with an open expression as if saying What

JOAN (CONTD)
I just find the whole thing
contemptuous The very idea of a
suicide note the idea of suicide
coming from you It’s such a
cliche isn’t it Someone so bright
and promising killing herself after
the glamour has passed

Frances’s expression has become colder more remote

FRANCES
Well for one that’s an extremely
shitty thing to say to me Two the
glamour passed a long time ago and
you know very well that it did And
third three yes my life is
riddled by cliches But do you know
what a cliche is

A slight smile grows on Joan’s face
FRANCES (CONTD)
It’s a story so fine and thrilling
that it’s grown old in its hopeful
re-telling
The smile on Joan’s face grows She admires Frances so much
FRANCES (CONTD)
People tell it Not so many live
it
They take a sip of their hot chocolates

JOAN
Do you want to go to the Louvre

FRANCES
Fuck the Louvre

INT JOAN’S APARTMENT DINING ROOM EARLY EVENING 102

Post dinner All are once more present The group looks
decidedly more dapper this evening Everyone is drinking
already drunk in fact

In the background on the dining room table Tom is arm
wrestling Julius

In the foreground Mme Reynard is passionately worriedly
speaking with Susan and Madeleine

MME REYNARD
I can’t claim to know either of you
well or at all but I can see
youre above such petty jealousies
Ugliness begets ugliness I
volunteer we strive for grace

SUSAN
Neither of us is bothered Mme
Reynard

MME REYNARD
You say that but you obviously
don’t mean it

MADELEINE THE MEDIUM
But I’m not in love with Malcolm
To be honest I don’t even like him
very much

Malcolm sits to the side listening to the conversation

In the background Tom defeats Julius bringing his hand down
on the table with a BANG He levels a look at Malcolm

INT JOAN’S APARTMENT DINING ROOM TABLE 103
Malcolm and Tom sit before each other They clasp hands Tom
focused Malcolm more relaxed amused Julius is officiating

he holds their hands together

JULIUS
Ready Steady Go

Tom slams Malcolm’s hand down on the table Malcolm hasn’t
tried at all

MALCOLM
You win

TOM
Come on Do it right

Malcolm nods they clasp hands again and again Julius sets
them off another easy win for Tom

TOM (CONTD)
(complaining to Julius)
He’s not even trying

MALCOLM
You’re the big winner
TOM
It’s not winning if I win like

that
Malcolm is amused He looks up at Susan’s pretty drunk face

MALCOLM
(to Tom)
If I win you take your bag and
leave - alone

Tom’s expression grows steely He nods his acceptance of the
challenge For the third time the men clasp hands Julius
sets them off The result is identical to the earlier rounds
Malcolm doesn’t try at all

TOM
(panting)
Wait a minute What do I win

MALCOLM
Nothing Everything’s exactly the
same as before

MME REYNARD
This reminds me of the performance
artist I saw on the television She
walked the length of the Great Wall
of China then broke up with her
boyfriend then everyone paid good
money to watch her go to the
bathroom in a bucket in a museum

Malcolm is absently rubbing his smarting knuckles Susan
kneels beside him she takes up his hand in hers She pulls
his hand to her mouth and lightly kisses it

Tom stands apart from the group outraged

TOM
I don’t like you people

He addresses Susan
TOM (CONTD)
I don’t like these people They’re

not normal people

Mme Reynard approaches Tom and puts her hands on his
shoulders

MME REYNARD
Couldn’t you please find it in your
heart to like us just a little bit

TOM
No

Mme Reynard sits on the sofa
Julius stands to face Tom He is swaying in place He opens
then closes his mouth He sits on the sofa next to Mme

Reynard He looks at her

JULIUS
I’m not used to drinking this much

Malcolm stands to address Tom

MALCOLM
Tom

Tom punches Malcolm in the nose Malcolm fallsits on the
sofa nodding as if in agreement with the sentiment

Frances moves to Tom She slaps him in the face and sits on
the now-crowded sofa

Tom stands in place holding his face His feelings are deeply
hurt He looks to Susan with a plaintive expression

TOM
Were leaving Susan

Susan and Malcolm are staring at each other affectionately

SUSAN
You go ahead

Tom takes a step

TOM
I’m really going to go This is
your last chance Now or never

She doesn’t look up at him

SUSAN
Never please thank you

Tom grabs his bag and leaves the apartment in a state of
mortification and bafflement There is a moment of discomfort
created by his abrupt absence

Malcolm leads Susan away by the hand He removes Susans
father’s watch from his wrist and puts it on Susans
tightening the band

MALCOLM
I asked you to come and you came

He is attentive to the act of putting the watch on She looks
at Malcolm lovingly She touches his face with her free hand

SUSAN
Youre dripping blood on my
sweater honey

Mme Reynard’s voice can be heard in the background Malcolm
and Susan turn to find her face bright reciting an Emily
Dickinson poem to the guests

MME REYNARD
I sing to use the waitingMy bonnet
but to tieAnd shut the door unto
my houseNo more to do have
ITill his best step
approachingWe journey to the
dayAnd tell each other how we
sangTo keep the dark away

The remaining partygoers look up at Mme Reynard smiling
amused moved even by her little performance

INT JOAN’S APARTMENT KITCHEN LATER 104

The group is quieter fatigued from the late night and
alcohol Frances and Malcolm are doing the dishes separate
from the rest Frances is building up to saying something

FRANCES
I’m bothered by the thought
of you hating your father
(pause)
(MORE )

FRANCES (CONTD)
I don’t like you carrying that
around with you Also I don’t quite
feel your father warrants it

MALCOLM
This coming from the person who
wants to strangle him

FRANCES
Yes But my offense is greater than
yours My wanting to kill him is
due to his prior kindnesses

MALCOLM
(pause)
Can I ask you a very dramatic
question

FRANCES
Yes

MALCOLM
Why did you have me in the first
place

Frances makes a face

FRANCES

That is dramatic
(pause)

It wasn’t planned of course I
thought I couldn’t have children
and had never wanted one Then
when it happened we thought your
presence could help us come
together You were a last ditch
effort in effect But then when
he saw you it clarified something
for him and he turned away
forever from you and me both

MALCOLM
But I shouldn’t hate him

FRANCES
Your father is an emotional moron
but he isn’t evil

Malcolm listens He looks at Frances with a searching look on
his face

MALCOLM
What happened when you saw me

Frances smiles

FRANCES
I’ve never been so hurt by
something in my life as when I saw
your face for the first time And I
asked them to take you away
because I felt I’d die if they
didn’t

MALCOLM
(pause)
And why did you come to me when you
did

Frances’s face brightens at the memory

FRANCES
That was strange wasn’t it

MALCOLM
It was unexpected
(pause)
Id wanted you to come you know
But I’d wanted you to come for so
long that when you finally did I
was confused

FRANCES
I’m sorry

MALCOLM
I know you are But don’t be I was
happy really

FRANCES
Were you

MALCOLM
Yes

Frances watches her son with a sly fondness

FRANCES
I didn’t know you were you I’d
have come right away if I had Id
never have let you go in the first
place

She passes him a plate to dry She can’t quite look at him
when she asks

FRANCES (CONTD)
You understand what it did for me

MALCOLM
Yes I know

FRANCES
Do you

MALCOLM
Yes

FRANCES
I hope you do

MALCOLM
I do

FRANCES

I love you pal

MALCOLM
I love you too

The dishes are done

INT FRANCES’S BEDROOM SOON AFTER 105

Malcolm walks his mother to her room Together they stand in
the open doorway She kisses him on the cheek crosses the
room and drops into her bed Malcolm moves smiling to the
hall

In the background we see Julius and Mme Reynard moving
Madeleine onto the floor mattress They’re laughing they’re
trying not to disturb her drunken slumber

Joan is brushing her teeth in the bathroom

Susan has changed into her pajamas She smiles at Malcolm and
enters their room He follows after He calls to his friends

The apartment is dark quiet still It is very late The
door to Malcolm’s room opens slowly and Susan in pajamas
sneaks out into the hall then moves to the

INT JOAN’S APARTMENT KITCHEN

She is surprised to find Frances standing in the dark
smoking She’s changed into a red Chanel cocktail dress
watches Susan saying nothing

SUSAN
Hello

No reply

SUSAN (CONTD)
What are you doing

FRANCES
Just what it looks like

Susan feels awkward She puts the kettle on
SUSAN
I can’t sleep I thought I’d make a

cup of tea

Nothing from Frances Now the women wait in the darkness

She

together Frances smoking Susan waiting for the kettle to

boil

SUSAN (CONTD)
I don’t know Paris hardly at all
you know

Nothing

SUSAN (CONTD)
I want to know it

The kettle boils Susan turns it off She looks at Franc
directly

SUSAN (CONTD)
Why are you always so vicious to
me Frances

FRANCES
Because you want to take him away

Susan opens her mouth to argue then stops - after all
true

SUSAN
All right But what if you’re
getting in the way of his
happiness

es

it’s

FRANCES
He’s happy with me

Also true

FRANCES (CONTD)
I don’t like myself when I’m around
you I don’t like the way I behave
Of course this is my own fault but
in the end it’s just another reason
to disapprove of you

Frances shrugs Susan find the conversation amusing she
smiles at her enemy

SUSAN
I can’t win then

FRANCES
No you can’t But perhaps that
doesn’t matter so much

SUSAN
It matters

FRANCES
Perhaps it will matter less soon

Frances stubs out her cigarette and selects a tea bag from
the assortment on the counter

FRANCES (CONTD)
This one and youll sleep

She drops the bag in the cup and fills it with hot water She
hands the cup to Susan

FRANCES (CONTD)
(casually)
Is Malcolm waiting up for you

SUSAN
No he’s asleep

FRANCES
You’re sure

What are you doing

Just sitting here under this

bench

FRANCES
Well I was just thinking about
you I thought I’d give you a ring

Franklin says nothing

A silence

FRANCES (CONTD)
Don’t you want to know what I was
thinking about

FRANKLIN PRICE
All right

FRANCES
It’s three things actually Number
one is do you remember our first
date

FRANKLIN PRICE
I don’t no

FRANCES
Yes you do You took me to Tavern
on the Green You ate your cupcake
with a fork and knife No

FRANKLIN PRICE

FRANCES
(amused)
Why did you do that With the fork
and knife I mean

FRANKLIN PRICE
(peevish)
I don’t know Frances Who knows

FRANCES
The second thing I want to talk to
you about is that I’m feeling badly
about our last conversation and I
want you to know I don’t hate you
anymore

FRANKLIN PRICE
It’s late to be telling me this

FRANCES
Late in the night or late in life

FRANKLIN PRICE
Both but mainly late in life

FRANCES
I can’t understand that as an
attitude

(MORE )

FRANCES (CONTD)
Your wife of long years who only
days earlier wanted to murder you
has experienced a sudden and
mysterious shift in feeling for the
good Is that not noteworthy

FRANKLIN PRICE
I guess so But Frances

FRANCES
Yes

FRANKLIN PRICE
I’m a cat

FRANCES
I know that

FRANKLIN PRICE
I’m a cat living under a bench and
it’s raining and I’ve got worms
and fleas and you know I’m not
much concerned about anything
besides the unhappy facts of my
horrible -- my truly horrible
miserable fucking existence

FRANCES
I see Well whether or not you
care to know it I felt compelled
to tell you and now I’ve done
that Are you ready for the third
thing

FRANKLIN PRICE
Sure

FRANCES
When I came to Paris for the first
time do you remember what I told
you about it About how I felt
startled to be here

FRANKLIN PRICE
I remember you telling me

FRANCES
Oh you remember something How
nice that is for you And me It’s
nice for the both of us Hail
hail

Franklin clears his throat but says nothing

FRANCES (CONTD)
Well I’ve figured out what I was
startled by

FRANKLIN PRICE
And what’s that

FRANCES
I recognized Paris as the eventual
location of my death

FRANKLIN PRICE
(pause)
And what does that mean

FRANCES
Just what I said Something in the
sight of this city sent up an
alert Now I understand what
startled me was the presentiment of
what was to come do you see

FRANKLIN PRICE
Frances-—

Frances snuffs the flame

FRANCES
Thank you

The women watch each other

FRANCES (CONTD)
That’s all

Frances exits the bathroom Madeleine watches her go We hear
the sound of the front door opening and closing

EXT SIDEWALK OUTSIDE JOAN’S APARTMENT 110

Frances still in the Chanel dress but now with a coat on
exits the building She walks purposefully away from the
apartment as if she has a destination in mind

After a while the door opens again Madeleine struggling
under the weight of her duffel bag exits the building
looking around for Frances

Frances is far down the sidewalk Madeleine seems to be
considering giving chase She decides against it and walks
away in the opposite direction Frances had

EXT PARIS LATER 111

Frances is walking down a narrow lampless passageway She
still wears the cocktail dress with her coat over top It is
late at night no one is around She walks slowly looking
into the middle distance lost in thought

A man’s voice becomes audible off camera Frances looks up
the passageway to locate the sound

PARIS NIGHT UP THE PASSAGEWAY 112

A MAN 65 is walking in Frances’s direction He is unaware
of her being there as he walks he is reproaching in French
an unknown antagonist with great bitterness hatred even

MAN
(subtitled)
And what is that to me you shit
Eh

Frances stops walking she witnesses the hostile man’s
approach with concern

MAN (CONTD)
(subtitled)
Who the fuck do you think you are
to me even

At first glance the man perhaps seemed a crazed homeless
person But we now see he is a successful professional his
clothing tailored etc

The man notices he is not alone and comes to an abrupt halt
There stands Frances an incongruous vision of loveliness in
the dark isolated alley Frances holds his gaze a moment
then drops her head and continues on in the direction of the
man She passes him by

FRANCES
Excuse me

He turns to watch her go She takes a half dozen steps before
he addresses her in English and in a much kinder tone

MAN
Are you all right madame

Frances stops turns to look at the man He had been so angry
only a moment ago but now his face is settled warm

FRANCES
Why wouldn’t I be

The man thinks lifts his arms

MAN
Just that it’s quite late to be
out

FRANCES
You are

MAN

That’s true

He shrugs He nods his head and turns to go Frances starts
calling after him

FRANCES
I’ve lost my cat

The Man stops studies Frances

MAN
Yes you’ve got the look of someone
who has
(pause)

And that’s why you’re out so late
on your own

She nods yes

MAN (CONTD)
You want me to help you look

FRANCES
Oh no thank you

The Man raises his hat to Frances He performs a small bow
and turns to go heels clicking in the night Frances watches
his departure After he has gone she turns and resumes
walking

She walks further down the darkening passageway Unbeknownst
to Frances Small Frank steps out from the shadows sits and
watches Frances for a time

He follows after her

holds a slip of pink paper in his hand - a summons to the
Headmaster’s office

As he enters the

INT HEADMASTER’S OFFICE HALLWAY 118

hewe see a younger Frances at once chic and harried --
fur coat but hair slightly wild She is speaking in low tones
with the HEADMASTER 50 fearsome serious

Frances is holding a sheaf of papers in her hand She looks
at the pages distastefully and passes them back

FRANCES
Well I don’t want to fill these
out And I’m not going to and I’m
afraid that concludes the tune
Good morning

Frances sets the papers down turns to face Malcolm and
gently steers him from the room As they leave Malcolm
cannot help but stare at the Headmaster To see the taciturn
man put in his place is an uncommon sight

FRANCES (CONTD)
So what do you want me to do

MALCOLM
I don’t know

Do you want to come away with me

Malcolm is uneasy

It’s okay Go ahead

Why was I arrested

MALCOLM
It said you didn’t do what you were
supposed to do

Frances lights a cigarette CLICK

FRANCES
Look They didn’t know your father
and they certainly don’t know me
and it’s boorish typically boorish
of them to state the terms of what
should have been done in an episode
they could never guess at What was
and was not done was done or not
done for a very good a very real
reason all right
Pink 105

MALCOLM
All right

FRANCES
What you have to understand is that
I was not wrong If this is going

word for that Okay
