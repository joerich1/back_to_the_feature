EXT JOE’S BACKYARD - DAY

Hammer strikes nail It hits off-center driving the nail in
crooked

Reveal the carpenter JOE TOY Our Hero A scrawny
skater-type kid with greasy brown hair parted in the center

EXT JOE’S BACKYARD - DAY

On a magazine photo of an extreme biker taking off from a
wooden ramp The biker and the ramp look awesome Joe
lowers the magazine to reveal

His ramp Not awesome Low quality warped wood Odd
angles Nailheads protrude dangerously from different points
across the surface A valiant effort but no

Joe grabs his TOOLBOX and walks inside

INT TOTTENVILLE HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

Joe sits in a middle row doodling The science teacher DR
FERRARA (40s) fires questions at the class

FERRARA
In any ecosystem we have indigenous
flora and Robert

KID (ROBERT)
Shale

FERRARA
No not shaleI like where you’re
head’s at though

Ferrara hears Joe doodling in the otherwise silent class
Joe doesn’t notice Ferrara approaching We see the drawing

Joe on horseback riding into the FOREST A girl rides with
him clutching him around the waist He colors her dress in
with a YELLOW HIGHLIGHTER

Ferrara STOMPS HIS FOOT once loudly next to Joe snapping him
out of his artistic trance

FERRARA (CONTD)
Joe Toy Flora and
JOE
(turning page)
Fauna
FERRARA

(off Joe’s silence)
And an allamanda cathartica would
be an example of which

JOE

in my life

FERRARA
That was my hope No drawing in

(noticing a raised hand)
Kelly

We land on KELLY a pretty girlin a YELLOW DRESS

KELLY
Flora

When Ferrara turns his back Joe and Kelly make eye contact
Joe rolls his eyes at her ass-kissing She sticks her tongue
out They’re clearly buddies

EXT TOTTENVILLE HIGH SCHOOL - 2 PM

School’s out Students crowd the sidewalk Joe walks his
bicycle alongside him keeping pace with Kelly

Beat on Joe Smiling but insulted

KELLY (CONTD)
How’s Patrick doing by the way

JOE
He’s fine I think he’s supposed

KELLY

Joe waves watching as Paul leads her away shoving his hand
into Kelly’s back pocket as they walk

Off his misery

EXT TOWN OF HUGENOT - DAY

Joe rides his bike home from school We get an impression of
the town a bank a church a barbershop Quaint

EXT WOODS - CONTINUOUS

Joe steers through a narrow “trail” in the woods It’s dense
with trees and brush

Craning up above the trees we see that the woods are
bordered on all sides by tracts of suburban houses In the
deep distance factory pipes

Off the sound of a DOORBELL
EXT PATRICK’S HOUSE - DAY

INT PATRICKS HOUSE LIVING ROOM - LATER

On TV “STREET FIGHTER 2” for Super Nintendo The boys sit
in spitting distance of the screen concentrating

PATRICK
My mom reminds me of Blanka

JOE
Because she wears cutoff jeans

PATRICK
No because everything she says in
my head sounds like Blanka’s crazy
victory roar Listen

On TV After a knockout BLANKA stands on his hind legs and
roars three times

PATRICK (CONTD)
That’s the sound I hear whenever
she speaks Just the jibberish of
an undisciplined animal

JOE
You hear that all day

PATRICK
All day

He pauses the game
PATRICK (CONTD)

I have to get out of this house

JOE

his torso

Joe simmers at Frank livid

FRANK (CONTD)
What Joe

Joe rises silently and moves to the wall phone

FRANK (CONTD)
What are you doing

Joe picks up the receiver and shoots Frank a threatening

look

FRANK (CONTD)
We’re supposed to be past this
Joseph For Christ’s sake
Remember what we talked about
Think of people who really need to
call 911

A moment of tension Then Joe opens the dishwasher
the phone in and leaves

FRANK (CONTD)
(after him) I don’t know who that’s
supposed to be hurting
EXT SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

Joe watches as his friend ANGELO 14 sticks a large
FIRECRACKER into a mailbox Angelo turns to flee

shoves

ANGELO
Come on come on come on

They run across the street and hide behind some shrubs A
nebbishy kid AARON (also 14) waits for them there

They stare at the mailbox Nothing happens

JOE
Did it light

The mailbox EXPLODES

ANGELO AARON
Ha Got you Remarkable

An INDIAN GUY 30s comes out and immediately spots the boys

INDIAN GUY

A little old Italian lady pokes her head out Angelo’S MOM

INT JOES HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Game night Lisa Frank and Joe sit around a monopoly board
joined by COLIN 19 bookish and CAROL 40 far too good for
this situation

Joe sits slumped miserable

COLIN
Carol the lamb was delicious Very
tender It felt like I was chewing
avocado meat
CAROL
Thanks Colin I boil it first

COLIN
I thought you might have I didn’t
want to presume

FRANK
Colin no one knows what you’re
talking about

Carol ROLLS Marvin Gardens

CAROL
Meh Pass

FRANK
Passing on Marvin Gardens Ballsy

CAROL
Well look at this I’m broke

FRANK

You pissed it all away on purples

(going through her cards)
What the hell is this Virginia
If you’re gonna rely on colors go
red orange yellow Strong
colors They attract the eye
People want to land there They
will themselves to

COLIN
Royal blue Also a fierce color

FRANK
Colin again we’re unclear as to
what you’re saying

Joe sits up

JOE
Don’t listen to this clown His
whole game is railroads He’s got
blinders on to the world

FRANK
Who’s “he” I’m right here

JOE
Blinders

FRANK
People need transportation Joe
They need to get from A to B

Joe points his hands out from his temples Blinders

CAROL
Just roll Frank

He does

JOE
Lisa do you remember when you
bought BandO and wouldn’t trade him
and he quit

FRANK
I didn’t “quit” I just wasn’t
having fun anymore Why would I
play if I’m not having fun What’s
the point of a game People play
games to heighten life to forget
themselves

COLIN
That’s beautiful

FRANK
Shut the fuck up Colin

CAROL
(laughing)
Is that true Frank You actually
quit Monopoly How old are you

Frank tenses up uncomfortable

JOE
Oh yeah he always quits He once
quit because Lisa hit free parking
six times

FRANK
Any sane person would have walked
away from that game Something
wasn’t right and you goddam know
it

Carol laughs and Joe joins her Frank shoots Joe a look
Joe shoots one back relishing the moment of comeuppance

Frank moves his gamepiece

FRANK (CONTD)
I will absolutely buy that
(counting out money)
Hello Colin

COLIN
Hello

FRANK
Do you want to be my friend

COLIN
Very badly sir

Joe watches this exchange not trusting it

FRANK
Okay then Right now -- Tennessee
and St James I’11 give you Park
Place and Indiana

JOE
Whoa whoa whoa whoa--

FRANK
Let the men talk Joseph

On Joe fuming

COLIN
Yes Clearly yes I would do that

CAROL
Frank that makes no sense He’1ll
kill us all

FRANK
There will be collateral damage
yes But war is hell

Joe looks at the board -- he sees what’s happening His
piece is in jail Frank’s building on orange It’s a setup

JOE
(to himself)
He’s pricing me out

CAROL
What’s that

FRANK
(big smile)
Your roll Joey Joe-Joe

JOE
This is bullshit Dad You’re
pricing me out of the goddam game

LISA
(eyeing board) Oh manhe is
CAROL
Oh come on Frank He’s your son
JOE
You can’t do that Dad It’s
collusion
FRANK

I can do whatever I want Joe My
house my rules

Frank lights a cigar and leans back A suburban Bugsy He
smiles at Joe rubbing it in Joe’s lip quivers but he
tries not to break tries not to give Frank the satisfaction

CAROL
Let’s just have a fun game No

FRANK
Hey I’m not the one who started
telling fun little funny little
stories He’s just mad because he
doesn’t want to be here so he’s
being a shit
(then)

Roll the die Joe Let’s see what
happens If you need a loan maybe
we can work something out at a fair
interest rate

A tense miserable beat of silence Then Joe rises heads
for the kitchen

CAROL
That was a cruel thing to do
Frank

LISA

Is he quitting

INT JOES KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Joe red-faced picks up the wall phone

INSERT - A switchboard operator picks up

OPERATOR
911 what is your emergency

BACK IN JOE’S HOUSE
Frank knows what’s happening

FRANK
Ah shit -- he’s doing it

Frank darts at Joe but Joe runs into the bathroom and locks
the door

INT JOE’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Joe sits on the toilet covering his ear

Loud BANGING as Frank attempts to break the door down Joe
moves toward the corner of the room

JOE (CONTD)
(into phone)
His name is Frank Toy brown
hairheight unknownHe’s
obsessed with railroads

The door SPLINTERS

INT JOES ROOM - NIGHT

Through Joe’s window we see Frank talking to two police
officers He holds the Monopoly board and makes desperate
animated gestures The officers nod

Move back to reveal Joe watching holding a flashlight The
room is dark

He shines the flashlight in short spurts out the window Dot-
dot-dot dash-dash-dash dot-dot-dot

After a few beats we hear THUMPING from outside Feet
climbing stairs

Frank opens the door

FRANK
Stop signaling

Joe shines the flashlight beam into Franks’s eyes Frank
squints and shuts the door

Joe lies on the bed miserable He spins something around
between his thumb and forefinger Flashlight on a small
green MONOPOLY HOUSE He looks at it then past it and
freezessomething caught his eye

The wall across from him Though we notice an “Excalibur”
poster and other assorted nerd items Joe’s focus is on the
huge SHADOW being cast by the monopoly house Joe regards
this “house” shape

Then shines the flashlight across the room illuminating the
TOOLBOX sitting atop his dresser

Beat on Joe thinking

INT SPANISH CLASS - DAY

Patrick enters on his boot carrying a team duffel bag The
teacher conducts the class to recite the words on the board

TEACHER’S VOICE

The sound of KNOCKING breaks his concentration -- Joe’s
outside at the window Behind him a scrawny olive-skinned
kid sits on a bicycle BIAGGIO 14 quiet but dedicated

Joe makes a “come here” motion Patrick turns his palms
upward in a gesture of powerlessness

EXT SPANISH CLASS WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

the window It says “I am in school right now”

INT SPANISH CLASS - CONTINUOUS

EXT JOE’S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
Bird’s eye of Joe bursting out of his side gate on his bike

in until treetops fill the frame We linger on the dense
green tableau It could be anywhere in the world

EXT WOODS SITE OF HOUSE - MUCH LATER

Patrick Joe and Biaggio stand in a large rectangular hole in
the earth DIGGING Judging by the stains and general
demeanor the fun part is over We hear grunts wheezing

JOE
(to Biaggio) Did you talk to your
father about concrete

BIAGGIO
He says it’s impossible and he
says if I ask again he’s going to
throw my binder in the garbage

PATRICK
(stops shoveling) Well shit man

PATRICK

You want to fill this hole with

Patrick hands Joe a box of frozen waffles

PATRICK
These are coming too (back on
subject) I’ve done the research
Joe Did you know that pine cones
are a legitimate source of fiber
That the red baneberry is edible
but the white one is deadly That
skunk spray can blind you No you
didn’t

JOE
(sigh) Yes fine you know things
But no one learns as much from
books as they do from actual real
life okay You can bring a
fucking meat thermometer and your
Cub Scout manual if you want but
at some point we’re gonna have to
dick up and trust our instincts

ATTENDANT’S VOICE
Yo Out of the store Not gonna
say it again

PATRICK
(ignoring attendant) Joe all I’m
saying is let’s do this right

CUT TO
MONTAGE MUSIC CUE “WHITE WINTER HYMNAL” by FLEET FOXES

Joe plucks books from LIBRARY SHELVES He stacks them on the
checkout counter “WALDEN” “105 OUTDOOR RECIPES” “SO YOU
WANT TO BUILD A CABIN”

Blueprints unroll Reveal Joe Patrick and Biaggio reviewing
them in an empty classroom It feels like a war room

In the woods Joe and Biaggio dump piles of timber next to
Patrick who ties them together with small vines They are a
symphony of sweat and grime

Joe and Biaggio watch as Patrick confidently bites into an
herb There’s an open reference book in Patrick’s hand

Joe stacks more books at the library counter “SELF RELIANCE
AND OTHER ESSAYS” Then the following comic books “SPAWN”
“BATMAN VS PREDATOR” “SUPERMAN CAMELOT FALLS” Then
another reference book “ID RATHER BE HUNTING”

Patrick messes around with some dry twigs and flint trying
to get a spark Once he does he blows on it - FIRE

On a suburban street Biaggio halts his bike seeing
something Swoosh pan to a sofa left on the curb as trash

Biaggio and Joe set the sofa on a lumpy wood floor -- the
house in the woods One wall has been erected

On his stoop Patrick picks leaves twigs off his jeans and
scatters them in the garden He keeps an eye on the door

Joe sits on the toilet reading his Superman comic

Biaggio rides his bike through an affluent neighborhood He
stops and looks off camera in awe of something

Joe and Biaggio guided by Patrick carry an enormous POOL
SLIDE ladder included As the inch closer to the “house”
we see that three walls have been erected and there is more
garbage furniture than before It’s getting there

Joe emerges from a thick bit of trees and finds himself atop
a decent sized cliff maybe seventy feet high Out in front
of him treetops stretch for miles He inhales

PATRICK

JOE

He sighs

JOE (CONTD)
It’s scary

PATRICK
Yeah it iswhat if I wound up

wound up like my Mom

JOE
She’s a strange bird

PATRICK
I had a dream like maybe two days

on the toilet and then ate it
before it could develop

JOE
Oof I feel like that’s dense with
meaning

PATRICK
Yeah

Patrick chugs a purple quarter drink
JOE
I had a dream that I could talk to

Sometimes when I’m about to make a

me a very definite omen within the

that

PATRICK
Okay lLet’s do that

They stand silent for the agreed interval each in his own
thoughts Then a clap of THUNDER Patrick furrows a brow

Reveal him sitting at the edge of a pond

He looks -- Joe and Biaggio stand on a high rock holding a
tire attached to a rope Joe has also grown wispy facial
hair Biaggio wears a swimming cap and underwear

Joe swings He lets go at the top of his arc and cannonballs
into the water As he emerges

PATRICK
Ehhhsix

JOE
(genuine disappointment)
SixGodammit

Joe swings the tire back up to Biaggio

PATRICK
Why does he have a swimming cap
but no bathing suit

Biaggio clutches the tire and surveys the stream nervous

JOE
(cups hands to mouth)
Biaggio just let go when you get
to the top It’s not even deep

PATRICK
Look at this He’s terrified

JOE
I know He once told me he’s only
afraid of two things -- drowning

werewolves very old music and
homeless women who can run or jump

PATRICK
That’s four things

JOE
I’m telling you exactly what he
told me

Biaggio swings all four limbs wrapped around the tire At
the top of his swing he does nothing paralzed with fear
He swings back and forth losing momentum

PATRICK
What are you a cat Let go

JOE
Were here Biaggio We won’t let
the river claim you

Biaggio drops his legs They enter the water at the knee
His hands are still fused to the tire He hangs there

JOE (CONTD)
Okaywe’re sort of in no man’s
land here Biaggio Just make a
decision We want to use the tire

PATRICK
Just untie it

JOE
Did you hear that Biaggio I’m
giving you one more chance to do
this on your terms

Joe gets downstairs via the WATER SLIDE from earlier As he
walks through the house we reveal it in its entirety

The water slide leads up to a “loft” area (just a huge ledge)
where the guys sleep Downstairs we recognize some garbage

furniture from earlier scenes -- a sofa a lamp There’s now
a dining room an AIR HOCKEY TABLE

As Patrick and Joe approach this corner Biaggio leans over
the table counting grains of rice

JOE
(to Patrick) No more rice And no
more pasta It’s time

Joe starts rummaging through a pile of supplies emerging
with a souvenir SWORD

JOE (CONTD)
What kind of game are we dealing
with

PATRICK
Deer pheasant rabbit You might
run into a lynx

JOE
Any bison Cougar Anything real

PATRICK
You’re gonna kill a buffalo with a
sword you got from a gift shop in
Colonial Williamsburg

JOE
It’s not the size of the blade but
the will of the swordsman

PATRICK
(rolls eyes)
You gotta stop with that elf shit
man

Joe re-sheathes his weapon

JOE
Okay Biaggio and I will hunt
You gather

PATRICK
Thenhere take these

Patrick hands Joe and Biaggio small cardboard MASKS with
crude FACES drawn on them in magic marker

Patrick wears his but on the BACK OF HIS HEAD

It’s so animals don’t pounce on you
from behind

JOE
(regarding masks)
This one’s supposed to be me

PATRICK
Whatever man I wasn’t going for
accuracy

Joe puts his on

JOE
So an animal will see this and
think I’m looking at him and
walking backwards and that all my
joints are backwards

PATRICK
It works Joe Nigerian bushmen
have been doing it for centuries

JOE
Right Nigerian bushmen And we
all know how great they turned out

PATRICK
What does that mean

Joe turns around with his mask on Then he sticks his hand
out behind him toward Patrick as if offering a handshake

myself as “having a gender”

To find CIVILIZATION The woods have ended They stare at a
strip mall across the street A BOSTON MARKET looms the
crown jewel of the shopping center

I hope to God there are A bear
would feed us for a month

doesn’t believe in anything is
easier to bring down

Have you ever eaten a bear steak

Sometimes I wonder we bury fruit
seeds and new fruit grows We
bury what is left and it’s reborn

JOE
Right

BIAGGIO
Could that not work with people
Bury the remains the vital organs
and a new one might grow

JOE
I don’t think it’s a bad theory
but we’ve been burying the dead for
thousands of years and that has
never happened

BIAGGIO
Hm valid point

don’t need to tell you that

PATRICK
Yeah I just had never seen one in
Staten Island New York before

JOE
Well that’s crazy There was a
time when you hadn’t seen me yet

Aaron’s mom brings over a cauldron of beef stew
AARON’S MOM (CONTD)

ten minutes

Eric immediately ladles a heaping portion into his plate

AARON’S MOM (CONTD)
I’m not kidding Eric I know
you’re hungry but look at it
It’s still boiling

Eric takes a bite and instantly spits it back into his plate
with a wet THUD He exhales and then lifts the food to his
mouth again

AARON’S MOM (CONTD)
Fine Burn your mouth for Easter

EXT BOSTON MARKET - NIGHT

Joe wears a hooded sweatshirt a hat shades He paces
fidgets Like a wanted man

Then the sound of speakers rattling with too much bass Joe
turns to see an ancient two-door CAMARO pull into the parking
lot This is Eric’s princess

INT CAMARO - NIGHT

Joe and Aaron in back Eric and some guido friend up front
Obnoxious TECHNO music plays Deafening

EXT WOLFE’S POND PARK - NIGHT

They walk down a path walled in by tall grass Distant
sounds of a party and faint orange firelight Joe and Aaron
lag behind the older guys

AARON
What if someone recognizes you

JOE
If anyone makes eye contact with
me I’m gone If they ask you deny
everything

EXT WOLFE’S POND PARK BEACH - NIGHT

Theyre at “Thirsty Thursdays” a raging lively keg Music
a bonfire a huge keg line teenagers grinding up on each
other Fun

Joe walks along the outer edge of the general party area
keeping his head low but taking it in Shit if his life
had been anything like this

ANGLE - KEG

Kelly’s goth pal VICKI comes down from a keg-stand The
guys holding her legs turn out to be Eric and his friend

Vicki looks at Eric who smiles like a creep

VICKI
Jesus

ANGLE - JOE

Joe hides behind someone’s pickup scanning the scenestill
no sign of Kelly

Suddenly he hears a SCREAM from behind him

And there she is by the water She’s surrounded by dudes
with backwards hats One of the guys has her around the
waist They toss her screaming into the bay Laughter
She emerges yelling and splashing at them

Tight on Joe

Suddenly two hands land on Joe’s shoulders and whip him
around A BLONDE KID is staring him in the face

BLONDE KID
Dude Where you been

He pulls the hood down revealing Joe’s face Joes eyes
dart around but he’s trying to keep it cool

BLONDE KID (CONTD)
Oh you’re not Doug Sorry bro

JOE
Uh it’s okay All good

The kid stumbles away wasted
BLONDE KID
Yeah man My fault Nice face

Joe turns to look at himself in the car window and winces
Unkempt wispy beard General filthiness

JOE

A hand reaches for the car door he’s standing in front of
He turns to see a dripping-wet Kelly

KELLY
Excuse me
(eyes widen realizing)
OhmyGod

Joe covers her mouth

EXT WOLFE’S POND PARK PLAYGROUND - NIGHT

Joe and Kelly alone on a SEESAW We hear party sounds in
the distance and lapping waves

KELLY
But why not like run away to
California

JOE
This was the only way to start
fresh on our own terms We answer
to no one We don’t need a larger
social structure to be happy

KELLY
(laughing)
Oh my God You went insane

JOE
Or we’re the only sane ones

KELLY
Well either way I wouldn’t have
the guts to do it

Joe beams at the compliment Kelly takes a drink from her
big red solo cup

KELLY (CONTD)
So umcan I see it

JOE
I mean that’s funny The reason
I’m out here risking the entire
enterprise was to invite you over
for dinner If you want

KELLY
Obviously “I want” How do I get
there Do I have to be
blindfolded
JOE
I’m not sure yet And it is of
absolute vital importance that you
not tell anyone not bring anyone
not breathe a word of this
conversation or any ensuing events
to anyone no best friends no
family No one

KELLY
Okay Can I bring Vicki

JOE
(beat)
Fine Just Vicki

KELLY

over the fire

He stares at Patrick
branches trying to be camouflaged

Biaggio

No response Patrick moves toward him

Patrick brushes his teeth with boiled water from the pot
He looks up and notices Biaggio about
twenty yards away clinging to a tree perfectly still

He is covered with mud leaves and

PATRICK (CONTD)
Yo I see you man

He’s now a foot from Biaggio’s face Biaggio won’t break
PATRICK (CONTD)
Hello I fucking see you I’m
looking in your eyes

Biaggio stares back unfazed at one with the tree

PATRICK (CONTD)
Dickhead

Fed up he pushes Biaggio off the tree

BIAGGIO
Oh hey What’s up

PATRICK
(rolls eyes)
Yeah “hey” Where’s Joe
PREPARATION MONTAGE
Joe picks yellow flowers in a vast meadow
Joe half submerged in a stream trims his facial hair

Joe lays out clothing options There are three shorts-and-a-
T-shirt combinations All are stained and grimy

“Upstairs” Joe unrolls a blanket revealing small safe
deposit box He unlocks it and removes a wad of PETTY CASH

CUT TO

Market Chicken

PATRICKS VOICE

Such hypocrisy

JOE
What This is a special occasion

Bullshit man How much chicken

JOE
Huh I mean maybe one or two
along the way Biaggio and I have
been pretty goddam dangerous out
there

PATRICK
(sigh)
I can live with the chicken being
store-bought but I’m disappointed
in the loaded potato I thought
that was really Biaggio’s recipe

JOE
That actually really is I have no
idea where he’s getting chives

Patrick looks at Joe’s moustache

PATRICK
And I’d lose that thing as well

JOE
What (realizing) Nope This is
who I am now

PATRICK
You look fucking weird man You
look like one of those kids who
works in the student Shop Rite

JOE
You don’t know what you’re talking
about The moustache is the real
man’s choice It’s a companion

PATRICK
It’s not a real moustache It’s
all stringy and pervy

JOE
Give it some time

PATRICK
(staring at it)
You look like that kid Mike

EXT HOUSE IN THE WOODS FIRE PIT - EVENING

Joe staring into the fire The wavy heat lines gliss to

EXT WOODS OVERLOOK - FANTASY

Crane down from an immaculate sunset Joe and Kelly watch
wearing huge flowing Arthurian robes Flower pedals fall

from the sky A land of kings and wizards

JOE
How do you like it here

KELLY
This is the happiest I’ve ever
been Joe But
(looks at him)
Are we too young to know what love

JOE

But we can be afraid together

He leans in to kiss her when

PAUL’S VOICE
Kelly

They turn - Paul waits by edge of the trees He looks

haggard crazed

PAUL
Time to come home

KELLY

She clutches Joe’s arm

PAUL
Don’t tell me This Thisboy

KELLY
He’s more man than you’ll ever be
End this Joe

JOE
“End this”are you sure you know
what you’re asking

She nods

Then Paul unsheathes two large wrought-iron hookswords and
CHARGES In one fluid motion Joe jumpkicks Kelly out of the
way and slices a ROPE running along the floor Joe then
rolls as we see a huge LOG hanging by a thick rope swing
out from the trees behind them

Paul turns -- it hits him in the chest obliterating him over
the cliff He bounces a few times along the rocky face and
then slides to a halt dead

Joe and Kelly peer down at him She begins to cry gently

JOE (CONTD)
You would weep for him

KELLY
Only for youthonly for youth

Some weasels approach the corpse and begin to pick at it

JOE
The animals will take his
eyesdenying his entry into
Paradise

He kisses her forehead then stares across the treetops
reflecting on the fragile nature of life

PATRICK’S VOICE

hed kill him He turns channeling his rage toward the AIR
HOCKEY TABLE He chucks it roaring in Joe’s general
direction It hits the WEST WALL and topples it Leaves and
dirt kick up blowing into the house

Joe watches his chest heaving with anger panic Then he
turns to Patrick They look at each other

Silence There has never been such darkness between them

Finally inevitablyPatrick moves to the door Joe watches
him leave It’s over

Biaggio approaches Joe meek

JOE (CONTD)
Just leave me alone please

BIAGGIO
What do you mean

JOE
I’m saying leave Get out of the
house

BIAGGIO
Be straight with me Joe Tell me
what’s on your mind Joe

JOE
I want to be alone Biaggio Get
the fuck out

BIAGGIO
Don’t mince words with me Joe
We’ve been through too much

Joe looks him in the eye

EXT HOUSE IN THE WOODS - CONTINUOUS

Biaggio walks out in a wide shot His head hangs

INT HOUSE IN THE WOODS - CONTINUOUS

Joe sits on the sofa back to the downed wall taking in the
ruin of his house

EXT WOODS PATH - NIGHT

Various shots of Patrick struggling on his bad foot through
brush and over huge gangly roots He uses a large branch as

a WALKING STICK

He sits on a rock massaging his lower leg Angry Sad
It’s all hitting him

PATRICK
Fucking Joe Asshole

Suddenly we hear a RUSTLE Patrick looks up

PATRICK (CONTD)
Hello

Nothing

PATRICK (CONTD)
Is someone there Kelly

A shadowy figure wipes across the foreground We can’t make
it out

PATRICK (CONTD)
Biaggio you’re smarter than this

We hear a GRUNT It’s not Biaggio Patrick rises moving
down the path as quickly as his bum foot will allow

Then a TUFT OF ORANGE HAIR catches his eye What is
happening

Patrick limps faster now panicking out of breath A
snarling ROAR

PATRICK (CONTD)
(to himself)
Oh fuck God Jesus
FOOTSTEPS Whatever it is it’s getting closer

Patrick STUMBLES on a root and falls against a tree He
turns hiding behind it

Patrick takes his sneaker off jamming the walking stick
inside it to simulate a leg He sticks it out into the path
as bait Nothing bites

Silence

He turns to look at the path It’s empty As he doubles
back behind the tree

We reveal a huge green 2-D computer-animated monster -- it’s
BLANKA from “Street Fighter”

Standing on hind legs it ROARS 3 TIMES in Patrick’s face

Patrick SCREAMS and instinctively SMASHES BLANKA IN THE
FACE with his walking stick

Upon impact Blanka transforms into what he actually is -- a
small tree with a shock of red-orange leaves at the top
Patrick has cracked it in half

PATRICK (CONTD)
Huh

He stares at it his head cocked He blinks Just a tree
Nothing scary about it

EXT MOUTH OF THE WOODS - NIGHT

Kelly walking on a dark street Alone Unhappy We hear
the clacking of her shoes

Then from behind her

stand face to face for a beat

KELLY
(blurting)
I didn’t want any of this to happen

EXT TOTTENVILLE MAIN STREET - DAY

Tilt down from the sky to a festive SMALL TOWN PARADE
Families teenagers the elderly all line the curb

Marching down the street attractive women in red white and
blue leotards Members of the local Chamber of Commerce inch
behind the twirlers in a vintage Cadillac

Banners read “HAPPY MEMORIAL DAY”

ANGLE

A group of college-age kids set back from the crowd sit
around an SUV drinking grilling

An adorable long-legged girl in sparkle-y FACE PAINT makes eyes at

A dangerous looking guy in a VISOR standing way in the
corner with his back to the WOODS He takes a sip of beer

She looks away Then looks back

EXT WOODS - DAY

They make out against a tree The parade isn’t too far away
we can still hear faint music applause

(takes her hand)
Come on

Where are we going
He leads her deeper into the woods They pause every few
trees to kiss some more
EXT WOODS WATERING HOLE - MOMENTS LATER

Shoes flip-flops come off Unzipping they are both
stepping on their shorts prying them off their ankles

Breaking the kiss he takes her shirt off chucks it

VISOR
Let’s go

FACE PAINT
Wait wait wait Hold on

She dips her toe in testing He grabs her pulls her close
more kissing kinda sloppy As they pull apart a shape
emerges drifts on the water behind them trees behind them

filthy and too thin

They see him

Joe averts his eyes The girl grabs her shirt looking to
cover up quickly

disappeared into the woods
EXT WOODS - DAY
Joe wanders tossing twigs around aimless Stumbling about
like a man who’s been in the desert for days
EXT HOUSE IN THE WOODS FIRE PIT - DAY
Joe jams flint against a twig into a pile of dry sticks and

leaves He’s awkward sometimes missing the twig entirely
It’s not working

INT HOUSE IN THE WOODS - DAY

He opens the cooler Scraps of odd unidentifiable meat
Four berries in the bottom of a basket A rotten apple
EXT WOODS - LATER

Overcome by hunger he closes his eyes and eats a bunch of

Wide Joe VOMITS some purple stuff into the stream

INT HOUSE IN THE WOODS - DAY

Joe looks in the petty cash box Just some change Not even
quarters

JOE
Shit

INT HOUSE IN THE WOODS UPSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

Frenetic camera Joe searches the pockets of his shorts
pants everything he brought with him He pulls the pockets
inside out Two nickels in one The rest are empty

His expression grows dire

In one of the pockets we hear the crisp rustle of money --
he pulls something from a pocket but it’s not cash it’s an
old Boston Market order scribbled onto a torn sheet of
paper Shit He chucks it aside

He dumps out the contents of his DUFFEL BAG Rummages
through the pile Beneath some junky housewares he

unexpectedly finds

The library books Still unopened “WALDEN””105 OUTDOOR
RECIPES””SO YOU WANT TO BUILD A CABIN”

And most appropriately “ID RATHER BE HUNTING”

Joe regards it with curiosity

CAPT DAVIS’S VOICE
From a statement given by Patrick
McGuire

INT POLICE STATION CAPTAIN’S OFFICE - DAY

Frank sits across from CAPTAIN ARTY DAVIS Frank leans
against the wall behind them watching The Captain reads
from a file

CAPT DAVIS
“May 12th We had a fight Over
something stupid butyou know
It got out of hand I came home
there was no point in going on if
we were fighting
(then)
The destination was Tallahassee
It was Joe’s choice he told me he
liked the word liked that it had
three double-letters”

FRANK
Hm Seems arbitrary

CAPT DAVIS
(nodding)
Patrick continues “I don’t pretend
to understand the guy I just want
him to be okay Let me know what
you find out”

Davis closes the file Frank frowns
CAPT DAVIS (CONTD)

CAPT DAVIS
Biaggio Verga McGuire says he was
with them the whole time

CAPT DAVIS (CONTD)
I’m afraid he’s given us nothing so
farhe has a contempt for the law
I’ve never seen in a minor

The captain presses a speaker button on a console We hear
the conversation in the interrogation room

COP 1
Why don’t you sit down so we can
have a nice discussion We’re all
pals right No reason not to be
CAPT DAVIS
(to Frank)
He won’t sit Won’t deflate the
room It’s actually very
sophisticated

Biaggio walks to the two-way mirror and stares through it
He knows he’s being watched

CAPT DAVIS (CONTD)
This kid is in my head

Biaggio returns to the chair picks it up and walks calmly
toward the glass The two cops quickly move toward him

COP 1
Whoa whoa whoa None of that

They wrestle the chair from him

CAPT DAVIS
He knows something Maybe a lot

Frank stares at Biaggio

EXT WOODS - DAY

Wide To establish

EXT WOODS - DAY

A EUROPEAN STARLING steps gingerly toward a pile of
appetizing berries

Reaching down to PECK the ground suddenly collapses beneath
it It disappears into a hole We hear sounds of distress

Joe jumps out from behind a tree holding his SWORD He
charges the hole upon it in less than a second

JOE
Bah Murder Murder Murder

He stabs downward until we hear no more sounds of distress
Joe pants falls to his knees rattled

JOE (CONTD)
You were just hungrywe’re all

(then)
I’m sorry I yelled at you

downward against the dry wood until he gets a spark He

stares at it shockedthen remembers to BLOW

FIRE On Joe amazed at the fire and at himself

EXT HOUSE IN THE WOODS FIRE PIT - DAY

Joe stands over a pot of steaming water holding the starling
out in front of him He’s full of grime and bird blood

JOE
Goddam it

He drops the bird in averting his eyes The water bubbles
sizzles hisses

JUMP CUT TO

EXT HOUSE IN THE WOODS FIRE PIT - DAY

Joe yanks feathers from the bird Wings then neck We can
tell he’s not happy about it but it has to be done

Go fuck yourself

He scrunches up his face and makes an incision

INT HOUSE IN THE WOODS TABLE - NIGHT
Joe wipes his hands with a rag looking down at something

A nicely cooked STARLING still whole on a platter Soot
marks and stab wounds aside it’s an appetizing sight

Joe scatters some berries into the plate beside the bird for
the sake of aesthetics

Then places a single green HERB on top

He sits down stares at his preparation He does not smile
instead he looks at the empty chairs around the table

He sighs
Then looks past the chairs squinting

Joes POV Patrick’s BUSHMAN MASK hangs by the door Staring
at him

Off Joes face

INT HOUSE IN THE WOODS TABLE - CONTINUOUS

Joe pulls his chair up again nodding across the table
Reverse to

The MASK a lousy rendition of Patrick hangs from the top of
the chair It stares back at Joe

Joe starts eating He opens his mouth to speakthen closes
itthen opens it

JOE
WhaIUm
(comes to his senses)
Yeah

Joe stares at the mask for a sad beat then returns to his
meal

Suddenly - oddly - the mask chair SHIFTS Joe stops chewing
and smiles A fleeting moment of delusion
JOE (CONTD)
--Hello

The chair shifts again Not much an inch or two But the
movement is obvious Joe’s smile disappears -- something
isn’t right

He pushes his chair back slowly ducking under the table
and finds

THE COPPERHEAD
Moving quickly toward his legs

Joe collapses out of his chair terrified The snake BITES -
but is still too far away to connect with Joe

Joe regains his footing and runs to the center of the room
It moves toward him sizing him up HISSING

Joe takes two steps back and the snake quickly covers the
ground

A beat on Joe looking around gaging his distance to the
door versus where the snake is He will lose that race

The snake is only a few feet away approaching tentatively
Joe is cornered Last option

Joe takes a deep breath and STANDS HIS GROUND The snake
pauses

Joe closes his eyes and puts his hand on his chest He
exhales slowly Tries to relax When he opens his eyes

The snake has re-coiled It too is relaxed Its tongue
flicks out every two seconds Rhythmic In sync with Joe’s
breathing

Totally calm Joe sits Indian-style across from the snake
His eyes never leave it
