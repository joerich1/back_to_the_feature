- I know who you are - Ive watched
your Olympic victory enough times
to know exactly who you are every
inch of you Please put your bag
down make yourself comfortable
sit make yourself at home -

(You quickly realize that du Pont can be voluble and
charming but the more time you spend with him the more you
see what an effort this is for him - how essentially
uncomfortable he is in his own skin Also he just might
have snorted a tiny bit of coke before he came in)

Mark sits Du Pont settles in sits facing him - focused
entirely on Mark He speaks intimately sincerely

DU PONT (CONTD)

I watched the video of your Olympic
run again last night After you
broke the arm of the Turk - after
they disqualified you handed you a
loss - after they put an extra
official on you to watch your holds
- all of which were legal - after
all that you rack up seven straight
wins to take the medal For your
country Thrilling Thrilling
Inspiring Take the gold medal

Mark cant recall when hes received this kind of attention

MARK

fails to support it

Marks staring at du Pont intently

DU PONT (CONTD)
When did you win your first match

MARK

Du Pont waits listening

MARK (CONTD)
I was well truthfully I was
kind of lost And I got into it
“cause my brother was wrestling He
convinced me to give it a try I
never told him this but I was
scared of losing in front of him
So of course my first match I get
