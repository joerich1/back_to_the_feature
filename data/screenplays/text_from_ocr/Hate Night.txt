FADE IN

INT CASSIE’S BEDROOM - DAY

A small upstairs bedroom CASSIE 17 cute but no
fashionista looks out her window at a DREARY DRIZZLING day
HUMS intermittently to whatever’s on her iPod

She cranes her neck to see further down the road below

INT ENTRYWAY —- DAY

Cassie purse slung over her shoulder now opens the door to
leave

DAD (0S)

CASSIE
Nobodykids from school
DAD (0S)
Where are you -- where are you

going to be

CASSIE
Just all over around here nowhere
important

Cassie swings the door open and closed with impatience
There’s an OLD CAR running out on the street

The car HONKS
DAD (0S)
Do they have to honk like that
INT OLD CAR - DAY
Cassie in the back seat STACY in the front and JP driving
Stacy’s 17 hot clearly a few levels of sophistication above
Cassie JP’s 20 pale tall and skinny looks like one of

the Columbine shooters

STACY
You like to bowl

CASSIE
Sure yeah my Mom and Well
yeah I’ve bowled
STACY

Maybe you can teach us
JP

We’re not gonna fuckin’ bowl
STACY

This is my boyfriend JP
CASSIE

Hi
STACY

There’s this bowling alley where
they’ll serve anyone beer

CASSIE
Oh yeah Lester’s
(off JP’s scowl)
Right

JP
(to Cassie)
You look like a fuckin’ virgin
You afraid to show a little tit

Stacy LAUGHS a little lights a cigarette

STACY
Don’t be an ass baby
(to Cassie)
Yeah it’s Lester’s I guess it’s
no big secret

Stacy hands Cassie a cigarette Cassie tries to smile tries
to act like Stacy but she can’t help stealing a worried
glance at JP

INT LESTER’S BOWLING ALLEY - DAY

If a bowling alley can double as a dive this is it Lanes
in disrepair some of them missing pins Nearly everybody’s
over at the pool tables or the undersized bar instead

JP Stacy and Cassie stand around a pool table nursing
beers JP downs his fast and pours another Picks at what’s
left of the felt on the table and rips it off in strips

JP
(to Cassie)
You afraid of beer Or you need
something stronger
CASSIE
I’m okay

JP
Quit being such a fucking virgin
You might need something stronger
Get you ready for later

JP smirks Stacy LAUGHS

STACY
You want her to zonk out before
showtime

CASSIE

What’s later

STACY
I told you we’re gonna have a good
time right I mean crazy you
know

CASSIE
Awesome
(a beat)
Doing what

Stacy just smiles

Another HIGH SCHOOL GIRL passes a couple of tables away JP
notices her and gets a sadistic grin on his face

JP
(too loud)
Hey Carla how’s your anus How’s
it feel How’s it doing How’s
your anus doing

Stacy LAUGHS again
STACY

(to Cassie)
JP loves anal

CASSIE
Is that girl -- she was before you
I guess

STACY

Fuck no that was like last
weekend I got to watch

(a beat)
JP does whatever the fuck he wants
Whenever the fuck he wants to
She says it like it makes her wet

INT BOWLING ALLEY LADIES ROOM - LATER

A nasty place Cassie looks at herself in the mirror This
isn’t quite what she’d imagined Maybe it’s time to go home
She stalls fiddles with some makeup

The door opens and THREE GIRLS come in PAULA PAMELA and
SANDRA all 17 all cheerleaders all bitches

SANDRA
Uh oh

Paula and Pamela GIGGLE Cassie knows she shouldn’t say
anything holds it in for a moment but --

CASSIE
What
SANDRA
Oh nothing
CASSIE
Just leave me alone
SANDRA
Why Because of your cool new
friends
CASSIE

Stacy is cool You wanted to hang
out with her all last year I
heard you say so

SANDRA
Really Maybe you should add
hearing loss to your list of
defects

Paula and Pamela LAUGH again

SANDRA (CONTD)
Oh yeah I did have a question for
you
(a beat)
Does your mom get raped a lot in
prison Or is she the one doing
the raping

A cold silence Sandra stares Cassie down Cassie tries to
leave but Sandra and her crew are in the way
SANDRA (CONTD)
Can I get her address in prison
My little brother’s fifteen and
he’d love a real sexy pen pal Or
is fifteen too old for her

CASSIE
Let me by

SANDRA

You know I’1l bet I can guess what
the worst part of all this is
Those boys weren’t just fourteen
they were ugly as shit

(off Paula and Pamelas

laughter egging her on)
If my mom went down on a couple of
crater-faces like that I think Id
probably kill myself

Cassie tries to squeeze her way past Sandra but Pamela
SHOVES her backwards sends her purse flying out of her hand
the contents sprawled all over the filthy tile

Cassie starts putting things back into her purse there are
tears forming in her eyes now

SANDRA (CONTD)
But I guess having butt sex with
Stacy’s creepy boyfriend is close
enough right Maybe you can turn
into just as much of a slut-whore
as your mom Oh wait that’s
impossible

Cassie’s standing now She’s kept the tears from coming
and she just stands there waiting for the next blow

SANDRA (CONTD)
You can leave now

Sandra Paula and Pamela part just enough for Cassie to get
out the door

INT LESTER’S BOWLING ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Stacy and JP at that same pool table along with another guy
RAZOR 21 nice hair good-looking and charismatic Razor’s
a far cry from JP
RAZOR
(sotto)
I pretty much built the fuckin’

place

JP
But you brought the --

RAZOR
Yeah I brought the blueprints I
planned this fuckin’ thing you

Razor smiles at Cassie as she approaches

STACY
Cass this is Razor

Cassie nods to him still shaken from her ladies room
experience

STACY (CONTD)
What took you so long

JP
Lubin’ up that ass
RAZOR
Shut up JP

That gets Cassie’s attention She looks up at Razor in
unspoken “thanks”

There’s a tense look between Razor and JP but JP shuts

INT OLD CAR - NIGHT

an

up

Rumbling down a wooded rural road not another car in sight
JP and Stacy are still up front Razor is in the back seat

with Cassie

CASSIE
Where’d you get the name Razor

RAZOR
You ever heard the phrase “razor
sharp wit” They got the idea for
that from my name

Razor smirks at his own corny line and Cassie rolls her
in a flirtatious way

eyes
CASSIE

JP
(to Razor)
Don’t we need to go get Hogan

RAZOR
He’s not gonna make it

JP

RAZOR
(shrugs)

CASSIE
Why Who’s Hogan

RAZOR
Friend of mine

JP
Which way Raze

They’ve come to a fork in the road
RAZOR
(still smiling at Cassie)
Left Up the hill
EXT WOODS - NIGHT
Stacy grips the trunk of an oak a strained look on her face
Her entire body rattles as JP fucks her in the ass from
behind
TWENTY YARDS AWAY

Razor and Cassie lean against the car and look at the stars
JP and Stacy’s GRUNTS resonate even here
RAZOR
Used to be when I was like eight
I guess you could see all of ‘em
from out here Then they built
those big houses -- monstrosities

Razor indicates a GLOW emanating from a hillside on the other
side of the woods

RAZOR (CONTD)
Big houses for rich pricks

CASSIE
You can still see more than from my
house

RAZOR

Fuckin’ assholes Fuckin’ rich
prick assholes I do drywall work
sometimes you know I built their
fuckin’ houses

A lot of anger here Razor’s jaw tightens And then just as
quickly the anger’s gone and that cocky smile is back He
lights a cigarette

CASSIE
Yeah
(off Razor’s silence)
So Why are we going up there
then

Razor moves over closer to Cassie

RAZOR
You like to have fun right

CASSIE
What is it like a party

A beat

RAZOR
Not really

JP and Stacy are done now JP comes over and lights a
cigarette Stacy’s pulling on her clothes over by the tree

JP
(impatient)
Where is he
RAZOR
He’ll be here We were early
(then)
See

HEADLIGHTS as a little pickup truck pulls off the road and up
next to them The window rolls down revealing PERCY 28
grungy dressed for work as a SECURITY GUARD

PERCY
What up bro

He fist bumps Razor through the open window

RAZOR
Nothin’ much

PERCY
Hey JP

JP gives him a sullen nod

RAZOR
You got the gate codes
PERCY
Hell yeah I got the codes You got

the stuff

Razor pulls a bag of weed out of his pocket and dangles it in
front of Percy

Percy nods and grins He looks like an unshaven hippo

PERCY (CONTD)
Yeaaaaah

Percy notices Cassie

PERCY (CONTD)
(to Razor)
That one’s yours huh

RAZOR
This is Cassie Cass this is
Percy He works security for those
rich pricks up on the hill

CASSIE
Hi

PERCY
I recognize you from around town

CASSIE
(meek)
You’re probably thinking of someone
else
PERCY

Nah Nah wait I know who you
are Your mom’s that teacher
right

Percy LAUGHS More of a series of grunts than a laugh

PERCY (CONTD)
Yeaaaaah that’s who you are
(to Razor)

Razor sees Cassie turn away Hands Percy the weed annoyed

RAZOR
Hey let’s do this man time’s
wasting right

PERCY
(eyes still on Cassie)
Sure yeah

Percy pulls a slip of paper out of his glove compartment and
hands it to Razor

Just as Razor reaches for it Percy snatches it back

PERCY (CONT’D)
But you gotta stay outta sight
okay

RAZOR
Hey man I already told you we
just want to take our girls up to
the lookout show ‘em a good time

PERCY
Yeah you told me
(indicates JP)
But I don’t trust that guy
JP gives Percy the finger lights another cigarette

RAZOR
Trust me man

Percy holds out the paper and this time lets Razor take it

PERCY
The lookout That’s it Get your
rocks off But don’t be knockin’

down any mailboxes or nothin’ I
don’t need to be gettin’ fired I
got bills

RAZOR

Don’t worry man
(holds up his hand as if
swearing an oath)

No mailboxes

But there’s a sly smile on Razor’s face Cassie turns back
just in time to see it She grimaces

EXT RURAL ROAD - NIGHT

An ENORMOUS GATE at the bottom of the hill The entire hill
appears to be fenced in The old car is stopped just outside
the gate and JP leans out the driver’s side window punching
in the code from Percy’s note

INT OLD CAR - SAME

As he completes the code

JP
This better work

STACY
We could climb the fence

JP
And walk a mile up the hill Don’t
be a fuckin’ moron

They watch the gate as with a JOLT it begins to open

Razor fist-pumps Looks back at Cassie and smiles She
can’t help but smile back but when he looks away there’s
that apprehension on her face again

EXT OLD CAR - SAME

The car pulls in and the gate shuts behind them as it makes

its way up the hill towards that glow of houses in the
distance

EXT RURAL ROAD - NIGHT - LATER

An empty stretch on a winding gravel drive The car’s pulled
over on the side of the road and JP is at the top of a
TELEPHONE POLE screwing around with one of the wires with a
pair of pliers

Razor stands lookout below

JP
I’m just gonna cut ‘em all

RAZOR
Don’t cut them all

JP
I know I know

JP looks close at the wires It’s dark and hard to tell them
apart

RAZOR
A-forty-seven that’s the one you
cut

JP
I know I can’t fuckin’ -- okay I
see it

INT OLD CAR - CONTINUOUS

Stacy and Cassie in the back seat Stacy reveals a bag of
weed

STACY
For later To celebrate Youve

virgin

Stacy CHUCKLES

CASSIE

Cassie looks concerned

STACY (CONTD)
Just to one house

CASSIE
Like for a joke
STACY

Cassie smiles

STACY (CONTD)

EXT RURAL ROAD - CONTINUOUS
JP and Razor next to the telephone pole JP just got down

JP
Your girl is a fucking little
virgin sweet tart

RAZOR

JP

in
RAZOR

then we ain’t got no worries
boyfriend Rich pricks right
Let’s fuck ‘em in the ass

Inside the trunk are a toolbox a bunch of Halloween
costumes tools and a NAIL GUN

INT OLD CAR - NIGHT - LATER

Following the twisty road up the hill

Stacy puts FACE-PAINT on Cassie -- painting her up to look
like a clown

Stacy’s already made up to look like some kind of evil cat
They’re LAUGHING having a good time JP’s got DEATH METAL
blaring on the radio

RAZOR
You two suck at this

Razor turns around from the front seat so they can see his
face He’s painted up to look like a horrible demon with
bleeding eyes

CASSIE
A lot of people are scared of
clowns
RAZOR
(to Stacy)

What’s your excuse

STACY
JP likes cats Right baby

JP looks back from driving long enough to show off his BLOOD-
RED CONTACT LENSES and a face haphazardly smeared with face
paint

JP

Tomcats have barbs on their dicks
STACY

For real Probably hurts like

hell

Stacy stops working on Cassie’s face and looks out the
window Fidgets with the face paint on her fingers

STACY (CONTD)
(to the guys)
You nervous

JP
Fuck nervous What the fuck are
you talking about Nervous What
am I a fag

But he is nervous The tone of his voice gives it away

STACY
Fuck you it’s a big night and I
don’t want to screw it up And I
don’t need you ruining it

JP
(interrupting)
Blah blah blah blah

Razor punches JP in the arm Playfully but kind of hard at
the same time

JP (CONTD)
Hey Fucker I’m driving

Razor makes eye contact with JP nods purposefully It’s a
“get psyched” look

RAZOR
We’re doing this thing

JP returns the nod smiles a little

JP
Yeah Yeeeeeeeah

Razor turns around and winks at Stacy who brightens and gets
back to work on Cassie’s face paint

CASSIE
(sotto to Stacy)
What are we supposed to be nervous
about

A beat of silence as Stacy ignores the question
STACY
Look up to the left I need to get
that spot on your cheek

Cassie obeys

EXT WOODED GRAVEL DRIVE - NIGHT - LATER

The old car headlights off creeps up the gravel drive
leading into the hillside housing development No houses in
sight yet just the GLOW of their lights

INT OLD CAR - SAME

The group is all quiet Razor craning his neck to see further
up the drive They near the top of a hill and a CHIMNEY
appears above the trees about a hundred yards away

RAZOR
Were gold

He and JP smile at each other In the back Stacy’s bouncing
up and down on the seat with anticipation trying to contain
her squeals of delight Cassie just looks confused And
worried

RAZOR (CONTD)
The path is right There

EXT WOODED GRAVEL DRIVE - SAME

The old car turns onto a hidden path and off into the woods

EXT SMALL CLEARING - NIGHT
The old car comes to a stop and the crew piles out

STACY
(to Razor)
So that’s the house

RAZOR
That’s it

Razor unfolds a set of blueprints lays it out on the hood
and JP illuminates it with a flashlight

CASSIE
Are those for that house up there

STACY
Yeah Razor’s got the whole thing
planned out

RAZOR
Hell yeah I do

CASSIE
Who lives there

RAZOR
Couple of rich pricks

EXT VACATION HOME - NIGHT

The edge of the woods outside this HILLSIDE ESTATE The
LIGHTS from other nearby homes GLOW dim in the distance the
houses in this neighborhood are VERY SECLUDED a good quarter-
mile away from each other at best

PERCY on his security guard golf-cart passes in front of
the home along the path that encircles the neighborhood

He pauses a moment to look around then takes a puff off a
joint and continues on by

INT VACATION HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Kurt 42 chiseled and WASPy and his wife GAIL 40 in every
way Kurt’s female equivalent lounge on sofas in bathrobes

Kurt eats some slices of fruit from a tray while Gail reads a
magazine

KURT
I’m just saying she annoyed me

GAIL
How How did she annoy you

KURT
Listen I don’t want to -- I don’t
want to fight

GAIL
(eyes still on the
magazine)
Then don’t

It’s all so civilized So muted
Kurt stares a moment gets up and goes into the kitchen

Gail looks up to watch him go then back at the magazine but
she’s just staring at it not really reading it

There’s a WINDOW just behind the sofa Gail’s sitting on A
SOUND from outside Soft but noticeable

Gail glances out the window Stares outside at the darkness
Nothing She looks back at the magazine in her lap At the
kitchen door She can hear Kurt RUMMAGING around in there

GAIL (CONT’D)
What ’re you looking for

KURT (0S)
I’1ll find it I’m fine

Gail rolls her eyes Looks back at the window She could’ve
sworn there really was a sound out there earlier She looks
hard Moves a little closer to the glass Is there
something out there in the woods

No nothing Must’ve been her imagination She goes back to
her magazine

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Kurt has a jug of milk out on the counter He opens a
cabinet and plastic cups come spilling out -- they’d been
packed in too tightly He catches most of the cups and
shoots a disapproving glare in the direction of the living
room

As he leans over to pick up the cup there’s MOTION outside
the kitchen window Like someone or something just passed
by

Kurt raises back up GRUMBLING under his breath He puts the
cups away leaving one on the counter for the milk Looks at
it Drinks straight from the jug instead

A NOISE form elsewhere in the house He sets the jug down

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Kurt comes out into the living room

KURT
Did you hear that

Gail SIGHS

KURT (CONTD)
I said --

GAIL
So some cups fell out it happens

KURT
Not that Did you hear something
else

GAIL
No

Kurt stops and listens Gail doesn’t care

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Kurt walking down a dark hallway checking the house He
stops at a stairwell and looks up Goes down the hall
instead and peeks in a few rooms The place is huge with a
labyrinthine floor-plan

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Gail looks up from her magazine again She can hear ECHOES
in the house from Kurt checking the rooms She shakes her
head

But as she turns back to her magazine she sees something out
the window out of the corner of her eye

Gail looks back out in the woods The same spot she thought
she saw something before There’s something outside isn’t
there

There is Something A FIGURE Barely visible in the
moonlight At the edge of the woods in some kind of a CLOAK

Gail leans even closer to the window squints to see the
figure better when --

A FACE
There at the window rising out of nowhere It’s JP’s face
right next to the glass the face paint and contacts making

for a horrific sight

Gail SCREAMS and leaps back off the couch upsetting the
coffee table and sending its contents flying

Kurt rushes in

KURT
What What’s going on

Gail points up at the window NOTHING THERE now

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Not so deep that they can’t see the house but deep enough so
Kurt and Gail can’t see them

Stacy now in a DRUIDIC CLOAK runs up to Cassie who’s just
standing there staring at the house

STACY
Holy shit Holy fucking shit what
a fucking rush Fuck yeah

Razor’s closer to the edge of the woods
RAZOR

(to Stacy)
Shhhh

He turns back to watch the house JP goes over to him Hes
all business like this is the boring part or something

RAZOR (CONTD)
You take care of their cars

JP
What do you think

RAZOR
What’d you do to them

JP
Enough

RAZOR
Not too much right

JP
Who cares man

RAZOR
There’s three of us that can drive
Three cars I told you about my
buddy with the chop shop --

JP
You trust that nigger

Razor ignores JP Looks back at the house

RAZOR
Let’s get ready for the next part

Stacy and Cassie come up on them Stacy’s still high off
that little scare they gave Kurt and Gail

STACY
You think she pissed her pants
You think she pissed her pants

JP

next part

CASSIE
Are we going to get out of here or
what

JP gives Razor a “this bitch is your problem” look and
reaches in a sack pulls out another CLOAK like the one
Stacy’s wearing

CASSIE (CONT’D)
(to Razor)
Because I know you don’t know those
people in there And that woman
was really freaked out She’s
probably calling the police

RAZOR
With what We cut the phone line

CASSIE
(duh)
Cell phones

RAZOR
Look at your phone Cassie

CASSIE
What

RAZOR
Just look at it

She pulls it from her pocket “NO SERVICE”
Razor pulls his out and shows her “NO SERVICE”

RAZOR (CONTD)

That’s why they built this fuckin’
neighborhood out here This is for
rich pricks who want to be fuckin’
left alone You can’t get a
fuckin’ signal ‘till you’re five
miles down the road

(a beat)
You think I didn’t think this
through

JPs wearing the cloak now He pulls a NAIL GUN out of the
sack Cassie sees it

CASSIE
Think what through

JP
(to Cassie)
Go back to the fuckin’ car okay

RAZOR

JP
Just go back to the car because
you’re ruining this Youre
fuckin’ ruining this you bitch

Cassie’s tearing up now looks totally confused

CASSIE
What am I -- What am I ruining

She looks to Razor for help but Razor’s just looking at the
ground

JP
Just tell her to get the fuck out
of here Razor okay

CASSIE
But --

JP
Why’d we even bring you You

RAZOR

leave

CASSIE
(to Razor)

what’s going on

RAZOR

CASSIE (CONTD)

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Kurt and Gail in the opulent kitchen Kurt tries to get the
cordless phone to work No luck

GAIL
Nothing

Kurt shakes his head
GAIL (CONTD)
So what This kid - he cut the
phone line right We’re getting
robbed

KURT
Calm down

GAIL
I’m fine

A light TAPPING at one of the kitchen windows A small
window above the sink

Kurt and Gail both look over but the curtains are shut
They look at each other

More light TAPPING Could be a tree branch An insect
Could be anything

Kurt approaches the window Motions for Gail to turn off the
lights She does so

GAIL (CONTD)
He could just be keeping tabs on
us Trying to figure out where we
are

KURT
What difference does it make

Kurt pulls open the curtains Nothing

Kurt gets closer to the window and Gail joins him

There’s a Cloaked Figure at the edge of the woods like
before It’s Stacy

Another Cloaked Figure comes into view to the left It’s
Razor He’s dragging something A person Cassie Shes
still in street clothes Razor dragging her limp body by the
armpits through the grass leaving a trail of what looks like
BLOOD

GAIL
What is this

As Razor drags Cassie closer to the woods the lights from
the house illuminate her enough that we can see it’s
DEFINITELY BLOOD that’s trailing behind her and there’s
plenty on her shirt and pants too She looks dead Her
face is slumped over so Kurt and Gail can’t see the face
paint on her

Just as Razor gets Cassie close to the woods a PIECE OF
PAPER is SLAMMED up against the window from the outside “U
R NEXT” is scrawled on it in blood

Kurt shuts the curtains and steps back

KURT
We should leave

GAIL
This is our house

KURT
It’s just a house
GAIL
There are things here we cannot

replace

They share a look She’s right

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

watching the house

JP
That was truly spectacular

RAZOR

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT
Lights on again Curtains shut

corner

A NOISE from elsewhere in the house A door

Silence

Gail watches the door to the kitchen Someone’s coming
It’s Kurt Gail relaxes

KURT
The cars are both shot

GAIL
They’ve been in the garage
They’ve been in our house

KURT
I think --

There’s a KNOCK at the front door Kurt and Gail look at
each other

Kurt moves to leave the kitchen

GAIL
What the hell are you doing

KURT
If they were robbing us they
wouldn’t have tried to scare us
like that This is some kids
goofing off I don’t think any of
this is real

He moves to leave again Gail grabs his arm She hands him
the butcher knife

Another KNOCK at the door and Kurt and Gail share a look of
concern before he turns to leave again
INT ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

Kurt stealthy but steady goes to the front door Gail
stands some distance behind him at the kitchen door

Kurt looks out the peephole NOTHING THERE
He starts to unlock the door

GAIL
Kurt --

He HUSHES her with a motion

Turns the knob Slowly PULLS THE DOOR OPEN Peeks out
knife at the ready Still nothing

Kurt takes a step out the door a step towards the front
porch steps looks out at the woods and there at the edge of
the woods is that same CLOAKED FIGURE in hideous face paint
just a dark figure against the treeline It’s Stacy

KURT
(calling out)
What do you want

Silence
And then as if to answer his question a RUMBLE from the

roof overhanging the porch and SOMETHING’S ROLLING OFF THE
ROOF

It’s a DEAD AND BLEEDING GERMAN SHEPHERD It swings there on
a rope as if it’s been lynched

KURT (CONTD)
(startled)
Mein Gott
Kurt looks at it mouth agape

KURT (CONT’D)
My god

He tries to look past it out to the woods but the cloaked
figure is GONE

GAIL (0S)

Gail’s coming closer to the front door

KURT

neighborhoods like “teach you to
stay where you belong” Says that
to me while they’re throwing my dog
in a van like some wild fuckin’
animal

(a beat)
They killed my dog I killed
theirs

CASSIE
But Razor that wasn’t these people

Razor turns on her furiously
RAZOR
I got a million stories like that
Cass I know what the fuck I’m
doing

Cassie backs down

RAZOR (CONTD)
I’ve got this whole thing planned
out

Cassie takes off her cloak and tosses it on the
Starts walking away

CASSIE
Yeah well I hope you planned on me
walking home

RAZOR
Cass Wait

JP
(to Razor)
I told you she’d be a drag man

RAZOR
Cassie

Cassie’s still walking

JP
We can’t let her leave

He starts to go after her but Razor stops him

RAZOR
Give me a chance here

Razor trots after Cassie

RAZOR (CONTD)

Cassie turns to face him

RAZOR (CONTD)

ground

CASSIE
(confused)
What

RAZOR
You know your phone number Your
digits

CASSIE
You want my number

RAZOR
Hey don’t make me beg I mean
okay so maybe you need to lighten
up But that’s only strike one
and you get three

CASSIE
Oh so this is all a game

RAZOR

I get it you think I went too far
Did you ever think I might be
trying to impress you

CASSIE
By killing a dog By soaking me in
pig blood and dressing me in a
fucking cloak and then yelling at
me You’re disgusting

She turns back around and starts walking
Razor glances back at JP and Stacy who APPLAUD mockingly
Looking determined he follows Cassie again He grabs her

arm and spins her around

CASSIE (CONTD)
Hey

Razor reaches his free hand into his pocket and pulls out
a PEN

He offers it to Cassie who reluctantly takes it
RAZOR
Looks like I might be the one
striking out
He opens his palm toward her and shrugs
RAZOR (CONTD)

But hey cut me a little slack
right

Their eyes lock Razor’s really sexy
Cassie’s resolve is weakening

Cassie glances over her shoulder back toward the road back
to the same old bullshit life

RAZOR (CONTD)
You can’t fuckin’ walk home It’s
not safe And it’s like twenty

miles

CASSIE
Why can’t you just take me home
now

RAZOR

I already told you Cass This is
something I gotta do I gotta show
these motherfuckers I gotta show
them they aren’t as fucking high
and mighty as they think they are

CASSIE
All right

RAZOR
Can you put the cloak back on too

Cassie hesitates

RAZOR (CONTD)
(sotto)
JP‘1l1 have a fit

Cassie takes one look at that sexy smile and walks back
toward her discarded cloak

CASSIE
But you’re almost done right
This whole scaring the shit out of
people really isn’t my thing

Razor smirks and winks at JP
RAZOR
Don’t worry well cut right to the
chase

INT ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

Kurt locks the door The dog’s corpse now lies there in the
hall and Gail kneels and mourns over it
JP APPEARS AT THE KITCHEN DOOR
cloak holds the nail gun at his side

GAIL
They killed Blondi Why’d they --
Oh god that means they’re in the
backyard

KURT
They’re on the fucking roof dear
They’re all over There could be
dozens of them We should go to
the basement and --

GAIL
No wait is the back door locked
If they were in the backyard is
the back door locked

KURT
Let’s just go down --

GAIL
They could be down there already
They could be all over you just
said --

KURT
Calm down

GAIL
Quit saying that

Kurt crouches next to Gail

KURT
We’ve got to do this together
love

She stands up with him More determined now
glance back down at Blondi’s corpse

KURT (CONT’D)
I’1l1 check the back door

Out of Gail’s field of vision

Only a quick

Kurt heads off into the darkness of the hall down towards
the back of the house Gail watches him go

He just stands there in the

INT HALLWAY - SAME

At the back of the house big windows look out on a pool
pristine landscaping gorgeous patio furniture statues the
works

Kurt creeps towards the back door knife in hand wary of
every doorway he passes every corner every shadow He’s
not jittery just wary in fact he moves with military
precision -- like a commando might

He gets to the back door It’s open a couple of inches
Kurt freezes with the realization that they’re inside
They’re already inside

A woman’s SCREAM from the other side of the house

Like a flash Kurt is rounding one corner then another cuts
through a guest room --

-- Another SCREAM It’s definitely Gail But it’s almost
more ANGRY than terrified

Kurt’s at the hall leading to the entryway now and there at
the end between the front door and the kitchen

Gail is slumped against the wall

JP stands over her holds the nail gun inches from her
forehead His hood is up but those demonic contact lenses
are fully visible He looks at Kurt there at the other end
of the hall Stares him down expressionless

Kurt shifts the knife in his hand Stares back Gail turns
her head to look Kurt in the eye Her eyes WIDEN

GAIL
Kurt

A BASEBALL BAT smashes Kurt across the back

Kurt drops the knife tumbles to the floor Looks up to see
Razor standing above him

At the other end of the hall Gail SLAPS AT JP’s nail gun
tries to get up

Razor looks down the hall at the COMMOTION --
-- Giving Kurt a chance to SCRAMBLE AWAY

RAZOR
Shit

JP PISTOL WHIPS Gail with the nail gun and Stacy comes out of
nowhere and KICKS her in the side

STACY
Bitch

Razor looks at JP sees the situation is handled and runs off
in the direction Kurt went

INT DARK ROOM —- CONTINUOUS

Some kind of game room A moose head and a pool table and
all that shit Razor FLIPS ON THE LIGHT Looks around No
sign of Kurt

There’s two other doorways leading out of the room -- this
place is like a maze -- Razor picks one

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Razor flips on another LIGHT Still no Kurt

RAZOR
Fuck

INT DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

An old-fashioned desk bookshelves and dark paneling even a
roaring fireplace The homey charm of the room is in direct
contrast to the violence unfolding within

Gail is in an easy chair tied hand and foot her face
stained with dried tears She’s not breathing hard though
And in her eyes there is only hatred

JP stands over Gail with the nail gun Razor and Stacy just
behind him

Cassie stands by herself over by the fireplace This sucks

JP
(to Gail)
Where the fuck’d he go huh Huh
He’s out there hiding like a little
bitch while we do whatever the fuck
we want to you

JP smiles looking all the more sadistic with that face
paint

STACY
You gonna talk bitch

Razor holds Stacy back Pulls JP aside

RAZOR
(to JP)
Forget it
JP
What
RAZOR

We gotta just get what we can and
get the fuck outta here That
prick is probably halfway to a
phone by now

JP
Forget it Forget it This was
gonna be all night remember

JP turns back to Gail Grabs her by the hair

JP (CONTD)
Bitch you tell us where your
boyfriend is or I swear I’m gonna
drill you a new hole and fuck you
in it

JP lets go of her and Stacy comes over and SLAPS Gail across
the face

STACY
Don’t think he won’t He’1ll do it

Razor looks back over to Cassie who’s shivering despite her
proximity to the fireplace

RAZOR
(to JP)
I’m gonna get the car

JP starts to protest

RAZOR (CONTD)
Just -- just listen I’m going to
get the car and we’re gonna grab
what we can okay Well try again
some other time

JP
Try again Some other time
When This is the fucking night of
our lives

STACY
(to JP)
He’s right baby

JP
What

STACY
We’1ll do it another time Just let
him go get the car

JP
(to Razor)
This is all your fucking fault
You said you knew this place and
then you go and lose the asshole

RAZOR
We’1l talk about it later

Razor heads out to get the car

RAZOR (CONTD)
Stay here

They hear the FRONT DOOR open and close

STACY
Jesus I thought he’d never
leave

She turns to Gail JP grins That’s his girl

JP
Jesus Who the fuck is that

They walk back over to Gail

STACY
You know if you’re not going to
tell us where your husband went we
might as well just have some fun
with you

JP aims the nail gun at Gail

JP
Last chance

CASSIE
Guys Guys c’mon
JP turns around exasperated

JP
Shut up virgin

He aims the gun again Licks his lips
FIRES
A nail lodges in the easy chair next to Gail’s head
FIRES again
A nail on the other side of the chair
JP (CONTD)
I’ve been practicing I could hit
you right in the nipple if I
wanted
(a beat)
I’d like to see those nipples
Shoot them off

JP and Stacy LAUGH but stop when they notice Gail doesn’t
seem scared

JP (CONTD)
What do I have to do to get some
more tears out of you bitch

JP holds the nail gun inches from Gail’s left breast Slowly
presses the barrel against her

A CRASH from the other room

JP and Stacy spin around towards the door

STACY
(to Gail)
Sounds like your bitch boyfriend is
back
JP

Motherfucker just made a mistake
JP heads out of the room

CASSIE
Razor said to stay here

JP stops in his tracks Turns and goes over to Cassie
Leans in close
JP
(enunciating)

He’s not the boss of me

And he heads out of the room

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Razor makes his way down the hill through thick trees and
brush

There’s a GLOW coming from the clearing they left the car in

RAZOR
-- the fuck

CLOSER NOW

Razor enters the clearing and there’s their car the hood
open and the engine ON FIRE

INT DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

Stacy’s putting valuables in a sack She holds up a little
antique clock

STACY
(to Cassie)
Think this is worth anything

Cassie shrugs

CASSIE
What’s taking them so long

STACY
Would you relax

GAIL
Are you sisters

It’s plaintive Like she’s trying to make friends

STACY
Wow The bitch can talk after all
(indicates the clock)
So is this worth anything or what

GAIL
You look like sisters

STACY
No we don’t

CASSIE
We’re just friends

Her voice is different now Cold and menacing
STACY
The fuck you say
INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

JP moves through the hall nail gun out in front Swings
around a corner and FIRES a couple of nails Nobody there

There’s a TAPPING coming from the next room JP goes towards
the sound Quiet stealthy PUSHES OPEN THE DOOR to the
bathroom

Nothing Just a LEAKING faucet
JP moves back out of the bathroom out into the hall again

He LISTENS A THUD from another room JP grins He’s got
him now He moves down the hall

INT DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT
Stacy and Gail lock eyes

GAIL
Let me guess you’re fucking the
Jew with the nail gun
(to Cassie)
And you Well you’re just a
little virgin aren’t you

Cassie looks away breathing hard

Stacy just LAUGHS cocky as ever She goes over to Gail
grabs her by the collar of her robe and gets right in her
face

STACY
Listen bitch Last time I
checked --

And Gail LUNGES Her mouth right on Stacy’s mouth Kissing
her No BITING HER Biting her right on the bottom lip
And she won’t let go

Cassie MOANS doesn’t know what to do backs up against the
wall

Stacy HITS Gail in the face and neck until she lets go
falling back onto the chair Stacy’s BLOOD covering her
mouth

Stacy falls back onto the floor BLOOD POURING from around
her mouth

GAIL
(in German)
Burn in hell you Jewish cunt

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

JP moves close to a partially open door There’s a
SCRATCHING sound coming from inside

He readies himself and --

BURSTS through the door

INT TV ROOM - SAME

Nobody Just a huge open cabinet revealing a PLASMA TV
displaying flickering GROTESQUE IMAGERY -- mice devouring a
carcass aborted fetuses a tribe of primitives giving each
other piercings etc -- the SOUND on the TV is set at a low
level This was the scratching JP heard

He moves closer to the cabinet because there’s something

next to the TV that catches his attention A giant symbol
etched in the back of the cabinet something like an OFF-

KILTER PENTAGRAM We will see this symbol again

Beneath the symbol encased in glass Nazi memorabilia
including medals and photographs of Hitler

JP touches the glass then backs away slowly

INT DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

Stacy on her hands and knees in front of Gail cradles her
mouth with one hand Cassie over in the corner trembling

STACY
(garbled)
What did -- Wha--

Gail’s flexing her entire body moving around a little like
maybe she’s trying to get out of her restraints but then --

She VOMITS all over Stacy Projectile vomit Everything in
her belly and then some

Stacy SHRIEKS and stumbles backwards blinded by the vomit

CASSIE
Oh my god oh my god oh my god

The lights FLICKER and GO OUT Somebody cut the power The
fireplace is now the only light in the room

Gail deliberately shifts her hard gaze to Cassie

Cassie DASHES out of the room nearly tripping over the
furniture on her way out

Stacy clumsily grabs at the curtains and wipes off her face

STACY
Fuckin’ Fuckin’ kill you

Across the room and out of Stacy’s view there’s an ATTIC
ENTRANCE on the ceiling

A MUSCULAR MALE FIGURE clad only in BRIEFS descends from that
entrance He’s controlled quiet with the strength and
skill of a gymnast only letting go and dropping to the floor
when he’s inches from it and makes no sound

It’s Kurt a shadow in the darkness only a few of his
TATTOOS visible Swastikas mostly plus a HUGE ONE on his
back the same OFF-KILTER PENTAGRAM JP saw in the other room
INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Cassie making her way through the NOW DARK maze of hallways
WHIMPERING and CRYING using the wall to guide her

She comes out of the hallway into the
ENTRYWAY

There’s a little more light in here moonlight from the front
window The front door’s in sight when --

A hand GRABS her arm
Cassie SCREAMS Gets SLAPPED in the face It’s JP

But Razor DISARMS JP with one quick motion This isn’t the
first time he’s had a gun in his face

KICKS it again

The door FLIES OPEN

Silence from inside the room No movement Nothing but the
fireplace

RAZOR
Stacy

Razor and JP creep into the room Razor with the nail gun
outstretched Cassie hangs back in the doorway

They look around the room No Stacy
The easy chair they left Gail in is facing mostly away from
them but the fireplace illuminates a WOMAN’S HAND resting on

the armrest free and not tied up

JP
The bitch isn’t tied up anymore

JP runs over to the chair Razor right behind him

JP (CONTD)
What’d you do with Sta --

JP and Razor get to the chair but it’s not Gail in the
chair anymore --

It’s Stacy her hands NAILED to the armrests A SKEWER stuck
through the top of her head all the way through the
underneath of her chin her dead eyes still open and her
mouth wide open as well leaving the skewer visible inside

Big four-car garage occupied by an ESCALADE and a LEXUS

SEDAN along with a riding lawnmower and a bunch of other
gardening equipment sacks of peat moss other junk

JP’s got the hood open on the Lexus leaning inside screwing
with some wires

Razor and Cassie both shine flashlights on the closed door
leading inside the house They’ve got it barricaded with
work bench and some other crap from the garage

They’re all pretty much shell-shocked at this point

RAZOR
(quiet)
How much longer

JP’s away from the car now screaming at Razor

CASSIE
Shut up and fix the car
(then)
Please Please I don’t want to
die Do you guys want to die

JP and Razor face off for a moment
A NOISE from somewhere in the garage

Cassie JUMPS shines the flashlight back over at the doorway
Door still shut

RAZOR
There’s nothing there It was
nothing

Cassie moves the light over to the bags of peat moss piled in
the corner

RAZOR (CONTD)
The door’s the only way in or out

CASSIE
What if -- what if they were
already in here

RAZOR
They’re not in here Keep the

JP sits up triumphant
CRRRACK A shovel SMASHES against the windshield

Razor’s wildly swinging the flashlight around but the garage
is too dark and the spiderweb-cracked windshield is
impossible to see out of

SMASH The shovel hits the driver’s side window

JP (CONTD)

INTO A TREE

JP and Razor are thrown around the car like rag dolls

Darkness A BODY being drug through the hall

The body passes a window illuminated briefly by the
moonlight --

It’s Cassie Hands and feet bound tight with wire a rag
stuffed in her mouth and a WELT on the side of her face

Kurt drags her by the cords around her feet Carelessly
almost Her elbows and head BUMP against the walls and
furniture

EXT FRONT YARD - NIGHT

SILENCE Then Razor tumbles out of the car shaken up and on
his hands and knees - he’s still stunned from the crash

He shakes his head back and forth regaining his senses As
the world comes back into focus he sees in front of his face
A PAIR OF COMBAT BOOTS

RAZOR
Fuck

He recoils onto his back Standing over him is HOGAN 25
tall wearing a crew cut and a tight thermal sweater He’s
not muscular and he’s not fat just big He’s got a duffel-
bag slung across his shoulder

RAZOR (CONTD)

Hogan
HOGAN

INT TV ROOM - NIGHT

Kurt and Gail lead Cassie legs now unbound to a built-in
bookshelf opposite the TV JP saw earlier Cassie catches a
glimpse of the Nazi memorabilia and shivers

They stop at the bookshelf and Gail uses a FLASHLIGHT to find
a LEVER behind some of the books She pulls it

With a loud CLICK the bookshelf moves just a little Gail
uses the lever like a handle and pulls the bookshelf open
revealing a HIDDEN ROOM

It looks to be the size of a walk-in closet and there’s
SOMETHING inside Lots of somethings But it’s too dark to
see what They’re big though People maybe Bodies
Cassie breathes hard as Kurt pushes her closer to the room
Gail shines the flashlight into the hidden room revealing

COSTUMES Bear costumes cheerleader costumes military
costumes clown costumes

Kurt produces a knife

CASSIE
Wait Wait please --

But Kurt just cuts the cords binding her wrists

Gail LIGHTS a candle and places it on a shelf inside the
hidden room She fingers the CLOWN COSTUME

Smoke still pours from under the hood of JPs car The back-
seat doors are open Razor and Hogan huddled around the
trunk Hogan shines a flashlight on BLUEPRINTS that are
spread out on top of the trunk

JP’s gazing down at a wrinkled Polaroid in his hand In the
photo Stacy’s lifting up her shirt flashing the camera

There’s a message scrawled on the space beneath the photo “I

Why not

HOGAN
The fuck should I know He’s
black maybe he’s got AIDS

Razor and JP nod in understanding

HOGAN (CONT’D)
Anyway were all at my mom’s
‘cause it’s my welcome home fuckin’
war hero party and this gangbanger
shows up all fucked up because he
wanted to fuck my cousin back when
we were in school and I kicked his
ass under the bleachers So now
this kid thinks he’s a hard
gangster shows up at my party with
this limp-dick pistol

RAZOR
Shit

HOGAN
Shit is right So he’s waving it
around like “who’s the boss”
right So I go upstairs grab my
shotgun from under the mattress
come back down You better believe
I put that boy on his knees Made
him suck that shotty like a dick

Razor and JP pause to take this in

RAZOR
That’s tight man But how’s that
anything like the tortoise and the
hare

HOGAN
‘Cause it’s got a moral Sometimes
fucking ignorant motherfuckers get
too big for their britches and bite
off a little more than they can
chew Get it now

JP
(nods thoughtfully)
Badass

Hogan and JP bump fists
HOGAN
Hu-rah Bustin’ heads like I’m
back in the desert

JP
Hey

HOGAN

JP indicates the AK-47 Hogan has slung over his shoulder

JP
You gonna let me try that out

HOGAN
Hell no
INT HIDDEN COSTUME ROOM - NIGHT
Lit only by a candle Cassie’s in the clown costume now
It’s way too big for her She looks at herself in a small
mirror affixed to the wall
GAIL (0S)
(through the wall)
Cassie Cassie are you dressed
yet
Cassie pulls on the big red wig

With a CLICK the secret door opens

GAIL (CONTD)
Come on out now dear

Gail retreats to a velvet chair in the middle of the room

INT TV ROOM - SAME

Cassie comes out of the hidden room to find it now lit by
dozens of candles

Three velvet chairs are set up in the middle of the room all
facing Cassie Kurt is in one Gail in the other and in the
third sits

Stacy’s lifeless body

The skewer’s been removed but Stacy’s eyes are still open
still staring straight ahead still registering the horror
her sudden death

Cassie stumbles backwards when she sees her -- barely
catching herself against the bookshelf Even once she’s
steadied herself she’s frozen her eyes stuck on Stacy’s
body

GAIL
Well

KURT
We were having a relaxing evening
until you and your friends showed
up Cassie You ruined our
evening The least you can do is
show us a good time

Cassie’s eyes finally drift over to Kurt and Gail

GAIL
Entertain us Cassie

Cassie shakes her head

CASSIE
No No

Kurt gets up Cassie cowers but Kurt goes over to Stacy
instead He stands behind Stacy’s chair puts one hand on
either side of Stacy’s face and uses his thumbs to CURL
STACY’S STIFF MOUTH into a frown

KURT
You’re making your friend unhappy
Cassie

CASSIE
Stop it

of

Kurt cocks Stacy’s head to one side her lifeless neck making

a terrible CRACKLING sound when turned

KURT
She’s so unhappy Cassie

CASSIE
Stop it Okay I’11l do it

Kurt goes back over to his chair

CASSIE (CONT’D)
What do you want me to do

GAIL
You painted yourself to be a clown
So be a clown Dance for us
Cassie hesitates Kurt moves to get up again

CASSIE
Okay Okay

Cassie starts a clumsy jester’s dance Can’t help looking
back at Stacy’s stiff frowning face

Kurt looks over and grins triumphantly when he sees Gail’s
smile

GAIL
Now juggle

Cassie stops dancing and reaches into a pouch on her costume

GAIL (CONT’D)
Keep dancing

Cassie starts moving again pulls three juggling balls out of
her pouch with great difficulty

She throws the balls in the air but only catches one She’s
got no idea what she’s doing Cassie looks plaintively at
Gail
Gail frowns Kurt sees the frown and scowls
KURT
(to Cassie)
Do it right

EXT BACK PORCH - NIGHT
JP and Razor crawl around the corner of the house and
alongside the pool JP clutching the nail gun No sign of
Hogan
They stop when they get to the sliding glass door

They exchange a glance

Razor gets up slowly quietly goes over to the patio
furniture and picks up one of the chairs

RAZOR
This oughta get their attention

He lifts the chair over his head as if to throw it into the
glass door

INT TV ROOM - NIGHT

Cassie on her hands and knees trying to get one of the
juggling balls from underneath a bench

Gail and Kurt still watch from their chairs

KURT
This is less than entertaining
Cassie This is --

CRRRASH The sound of GLASS SHATTERING echoes through the
house

Kurt and Gail are up in a flash share a quick look Kurt
smiles at Cassie

KURT (CONTD)
Seems your friends returned after
all

Kurt lets his robe slide off into the chair as Gail grabs
Cassie and forces her into the hidden room

INT HIDDEN COSTUME ROOM - SAME

Gail PUTS OUT the candle with her fingers and steps back out
Shuts the secret door plunging Cassie into total DARKNESS
INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Kurt jogs smoothly down the dark hallway toward the back
porch Suddenly he TRIPS and falls forward As his hands
contact the ground to brace his fall there’s a LOUD POP-POP-
POP

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Hogan stalking through the room with his rifle at his

shoulder like he’s Rambo He smirks as he hears the POPPING
He knows where Kurt is now

INT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Kurt rolls over covering his ears and gasps in pain He
frantically looks around and we see that he has fallen into a
coil of RAZOR-WIRE Scattered amongst the wire on the ground
are many PILL-SIZED FIRECRACKERS

KURT
Mein gott

INT HIDDEN COSTUME ROOM - NIGHT

Almost complete darkness Just a sense of MOVEMENT And
then a SMALL LIGHT

Cassie’s dug her cell-phone out of the pile of clothes she
shed when changing into the clown costume Checks it Still
“NO SERVICE”

Cassie shines the phone around the small room her hand
TREMBLING

She sits on the floor for a minute phone in her lap Shuts
her eyes and concentrates Focuses Calms herself Then
she shines the light around on the floor beneath the
costumes

The carpet looks sloppy and loose against the wall She runs
her free hand around the edges of the carpet until she gets
to a spot where she can actually slip her fingers under the
carpet

There’s something there She pulls on it

CLICK Cassie looks around to see the secret door open just
a crack

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Hogan is up against the wall right outside of the hallway
where we can hear Kurt GRUNT AND GROAN as he struggles to
free himself from the wire

HOGAN
(whispering)
Ready steady

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Hogan WHIRLS around the corner with his rifle at his shoulder
ready to go to war but as soon as he does Kurt is in his
face grabbing the rifle barrel and forcing it into the air

As Hogan and Kurt struggle over the rifle it DISCHARGES
several times into the ceiling

Kurt uses his free hand to grab the base of the rifle’s
Magazine pull a lever and send the magazine falling to the
floor He yanks the rifle forward and jams the butt into
Hogan’s face sending him sprawling back into the living
room
INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Hogan falls backwards and Kurt leaps after him like a tiger
But as Hogan hits the floor he does a backwards summersault
to regain his footing and kicks Kurt in the chin
Kurt spits out blood and squares off against Hogan in the
middle of the living room There’s a momentary flash of
doubt on Kurt’s face
HOGAN
Okay motherfucker it’s business
time

KURT

Lunges into Hogan slamming Hogan into the wall so hard the
pictures fall off CRACKING against the wood floor

HOGAN

Puts a knee in Kurt’s face grabs him by the hair
KURT

Breaks free with a swim move

HOGAN

Doesn’t hesitate Wraps his arms around Kurt from behind
crushing his chest

KURT

With a GRUNT of effort gets enough momentum to pull both of
them down onto a glass coffee table CRUSHING it

EXT BACK YARD - NIGHT

Razor and JP are crouched behind a giant LION STATUE waiting
for Hogan to clean up their mess

Razor leans over the pool He’s strangely calm even
listless In the moonlight he can see his faint reflection --
that demonic face paint

He dips his hand in and uses the water to begin wiping off
the paint

JP
Fuck dude Fuck
RAZOR
Relax
JP
Think he got ‘em I think he got
‘em
RAZOR

Relax stick to the plan

JP
Fuck you I’m going in Hogan
can’t have all the fun

JP readies the nail gun

RAZOR
Stick to the plan JP

JP peeks his head out from behind statue and looks toward the
house

JP
Oh shit

RAZOR
What

JP

Take a look at this shit
Razor looks toward the house

Through an upstairs window we see Cassie She’s trying to
OPEN THE WINDOW but it’s locked up

RAZOR
Fuck

Cassie’s now banging on the window like she’s trying to break
it

JP
I figured she was dead for sure
Why’d they fuckin’ kill Stacy and
let that little virgin live

She disappears from the window for a moment and returns with
a SMALL CHAIR repeatedly SLAMMING it against the window with
no effect

JP (CONTD)
You think they raped her
RAZOR
Shut up
JP

They killed my fuckin’ girlfriend
man you don’t tell me when to shut

up

Razor’s not concerned about hiding anymore He’s completely
out from behind the statue staring in horror at the window

RAZOR
Goddamnit Cassie

Cassie sees Razor puts her palms against the window crying
mouths the words “HELP ME”

RAZOR (CONTD)
We should help her

JP
(like a real asshole)
Thought you said to stick to the
plan
Suddenly we see Gail standing behind Cassie in the window

RAZOR
Shit Cassie

Razor wildly gesticulates at the window trying to get Cassie
to look behind her

Cassie cocks her head in confusion

Gail GRABS Cassie around the neck and yanks her away from the
window and out of sight
RAZOR (CONTD)
Gimme the nail gun

JP
Fuck no We’re sticking to the
plan remember

RAZOR
JP

JP
Sure kicking their ass for Stacy’s
not good enough for you but now
your little virgin’s in trouble and
youre all --
Razor PUNCHES JP in the gut

JP doubles over and Razor rips the nail gun out of

RAZOR
You are fucked up man

Razor turns and heads toward the house JP shakes
pain and follows him
INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Hogan and Kurt still locked in combat Looks like
the upper hand

HOGAN
Has Kurt wrapped up in a judo hold
KURT

Does a quick twist in an attempt to get loose but

HOGAN

Stops him with ease Tightens his grip
HOGAN

Youre dealing with US military

know-how now bitch

HOGAN

Throws Kurt into an end-table SHATTERING the lamp
on it

He goes over to Kurt ready to finish the job

his hand

off the

Hogan has

that sat

KURT

Crouched in the ruins of the end-table Looks half-dead
Beaten But as Hogan approaches he turns his head and
SMILES

HOGAN (CONT’D)
You want some more huh

KURT

Picks up a shard of glass and slowly CUTS HIMSELF across the
chest with it One long nasty cut as if to prove it’s
sharpness

HOGAN

Whips out a Marine-issue knife Keeps coming until

KURT

Rears back with the shard of glass misdirecting Hogan’s
attention as he then --

Strikes out from his crouching position with one leg Kicks
Hogan right in the knee buckling the knee and BENDING
HOGAN’S LEG BACKWARDS with a horrific CRACK

Hogan SCREAMS in pain

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

JP and Razor about to climb the stairs when they hear Hogan’s
SCREAM

JP
What the fuck

Razor goes running towards the sound JP follows

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kurt kneels over a collapsed but conscious Hogan In one
hand he holds Hogan’s knife and with the other he CUTS into
Hogan’s chest with a shard of glass

Hogan SCREAMS some more

Razor runs in comes to a quick halt when he sees Hogan there
on the floor

Kurt looks up for just a moment locks eyes with Razor

HOGAN
Please P-p-please Pleeeeease

Kurt looks back down at Hogan

JP runs up on the scene right behind Razor and just in time
to see --

Kurt SLITS Hogan’s throat with Hogan’s knife Hogan’s
screaming comes to a gurgling halt as his blood SPRAYS across
Kurt’s face

Kurt looks back up at JP and Razor
JP turns tail and RUNS
Kurt begins to stand up

Razor raises the nail gun and points it at Kurt Slowly
backs away into the darkness of the hall

He turns backwards around a corner Can’t see Kurt any
longer Continues to back up feeling around behind him with
his free hand Kurt could come after him at any moment and
then --

WHAM Razor backs into something TRIPS AND FALLS Swings the
nail gun around --

But it’s just the STAIRS

Breathing harder now sweating an ocean Razor looks back at
the hall Goes up the stairs

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

JP runs through the hall Turns a corner and sees the
sliding glass door the same one they broke with a chair
earlier not thirty feet away The soft moonlight is like
the light at the end of the tunnel beckoning to him

He’s frozen Standing there looking at the door Even in
that thirty feet there’s THREE DOORWAYS on either side of the
hall All of them open All of them a threat

JP studies the doorways the best he can in the darkness
Gail could be standing in any of them waiting for him

He looks behind him Then again at the sliding glass door
terrified of making this decision

And then one more glance back into the house --

SOMEONE’S THERE A dark figure But as soon as JP looks the
figure disappears into another room

JP makes a run for the sliding glass door Breathing hard
grunting running as hard and as fast as he ever has

He’s past the first doorway

Past the second

The third looms and then --

JP CRASHES to the ground amidst a chorus of noisy POPS
He’s fallen into one of Hogan’s RAZOR WIRE TRAPS The
FIRECRACKERS continue to go off as JP struggles to free

himself from the razor wire

JP
Fuck fuck no jesus no

He’s struggling too hard only becoming more entangled

He looks back down the hall Nobody after him yet
Finally frees one of his legs

Looks back again --

And there’s Kurt Standing there in the hall

JP struggles harder

Kurt begins walking towards him

JP’s halfway out of the wire now he might just get away
He’s nearly freed his other leg Kurt’s about twenty feet
away still walking and then suddenly --

Gail steps out of the third doorway She stands right over
UP

INT STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Razor creeps up the staircase nail gun at the ready JPs
VOICE echoes through the house

JP (0S)
Razor Razor where are you fucking
help Fucking -- You fuckers You
motherfuckers

And then only a short SCREAM

Razor stops for a moment to listen then keeps moving up the
stairs

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Razor swings around into the hall

Nobody there

INT TV ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Empty save for Stacy’s corpse still in an easy chair The
candles are still lit

Razor comes in slow nail gun out in front Sees Stacy’s
body the other two empty chairs

He goes over to the window Parts the curtains and looks out
at the pool This is the window Cassie was at earlier
Walks over by the Nazi memorabilia then heads back towards
the door

As he nears the door he takes one last look around Does a
double-take at the built in bookshelf Something’s not
right here

INT WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Darkness mostly The moonlight from a tiny window
illuminates a few stacks of two-by-fours and a table saw

The sound of the door being UNLOCKED
The door opens
And there’s JP stripped to his underwear his nose bloodied
and hands duct-taped in front of him a dog’s choke-collar
around his neck
Gail is behind him holding the leash Kurt comes in after
with the flashlight Gail’s in her robe and Kurt now wears a
loose souvenir t-shirt and pajama pants
JP BLUBBERS and WHIMPERS like a bitch
JP
Oh please don’t hurt me Please
just let me go Please I swear I

swear I --

Gail yanks the choke-collar

JP gags

GAIL
I told you to shut up

She locates a battery-operated LANTERN hanging from the
ceiling and turns it on

Now that the light’s on it’s clearer this room is a
hobbyist’s dream Like a mini metal and wood shop combined

Several homemade pieces of furniture around some finished
some not

Kurt comes over to JP JP cowers but straightens again with
a slight yank from Gail

Kurt forces JP into a homemade wooden chair and Gail duct
tapes his legs and body to the chair

As Gail tapes Kurt goes over to the one of the work-tables
lays a few two-by fours down and begins working with a SAW

From where JP is he can’t see onto the table to see what
Kurt is building

Kurt’s done sawing HAMMERS a few nails into something
Gail finishes taping satisfied JP’s secure She gets four
six-inch iron rods out of a drawer and goes to work on them

with a METAL SHARPENER

Gail and Kurt MUTTER back and forth to one another as they
work but nothing JP can hear

Both their backs are turned and JP struggles with the tape
Tries to find a weakness Can’t budge

Gail’s done with the iron rods They’re like giant iron
nails now She picks up a big mallet

JP sees the nails and the mallet Begins shaking his head
with realization

JP
No No

Kurt’s done with what he was building He pulls it off the
table and holds it standing on one end right in front of JP

A life-sized WOODEN CROSS

JP (CONTD)
No No you fuckers You
fuckerrrrrrrs

INT HIDDEN COSTUME ROOM - NIGHT

Cassie still in the clown outfit duct tape over her mouth
and binding her wrists and ankles wriggles on the floor
trying to free herself when --

CLICK The secret door opens

Cassie looks up eyes wide afraid of who might be coming
But it’s Razor

Razor bends over and grabs the tape on her mouth

RAZOR
You ready

Cassie nods
Razor RIPS the tape off
Cassie winces

CASSIE
Are they --

Razor flicks his wrist and a nasty looking RAZOR BLADE slides
out of the cuff of his sleeve and into his hand He uses the
blade to free Cassie’s hands

RAZOR
They’re still out there They got
UP

CASSIE

How did you know I was in here

RAZOR
I helped build this place
remember The room looked too
small so

He’s got her hands free and the two of them quickly free her
ankles as well

Cassie touches his hand and they lock eyes And Cassie
PUNCHES him in the face

RAZOR (CONTD)
Hey

CASSIE
Why the hell did you bring me here

RAZOR
It wasn’t supposed to be like this

CASSIE
Why Why bring me

RAZOR
JP’s got Stacy I needed a girl
too okay Stacy told me about
you

CASSIE
You figured I was as screwed up as
you guys huh Well I’m not And
I’m not your girl

RAZOR
Hey I came back for you
CASSIE
Fuck you
Razor stands
RAZOR

You want to get the fuck out of
here or what

Cassie looks up at him She can’t argue with that

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Razor moves swiftly through the hall pulls Cassie by the
hand behind him

There’s no dilly-dallying now no hesitation They’re
getting the fuck out of here

AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS

Razor swings around the corner with the nail gun Nobody
there But the staircase is long and winding

They wait in silence for a moment

Razor lets go of Cassie’s hand and starts moving down the
staircase winces as the stairs CREAK Cassie follows

A bend in the staircase looms Razor swings around it
Nothing
The foot of the stairs in sight now
Razor and Cassie exchange a glance Keep going
Closer Closer to the foot of the stairs
Maybe three stairs from the bottom now
A SHUFFLING SOUND
Razor and Cassie freeze

The SOUND is coming from somewhere close It’s like
someone’s DRAGGING something

Razor’s hands shake as he holds out the nail gun

But the DRAGGING is getting farther away Farther
Farther Almost inaudible now

Razor’s hands stop shaking and Cassie’s breathing eases
And that’s when Kurt APPEARS AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS with a
fireplace poker He swings the poker at Razor and knocks the

nail gun out of his hands It falls to the ground broken

RAZOR
Run

Cassie’s already running back up the stairs Razor’s right
behind her

RAZOR (CONT ’D)
Go go go
INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

Cassie and Razor run down the hall unsure where exactly they
should be running to

Razor stops at a doorway Grabs Cassie to stop her pulls
her into the room
INT GAMEROOM - SAME

This is the gameroom from earlier The one with the pool
table and the moose head

Razor SLAMS the door shut Locks it But there’s two other
doors leading out of this room He runs over to one of them

RAZOR
The door The other one

Cassie hesitates then sees the third door and runs over to
it

Razor locks the door he’s at

Cassie reaches the third door The PATTERING of footsteps

coming towards it from the hall She SLAMS it shut Locks
it The footsteps stop

She backs away from the door jumps when she runs into the
pool table

Razor grabs one of the pool cues and holds it like a weapon
Turns from door to door waiting for one to get busted in

Nothing Not a sound

And then a loud POP And the POWER IS BACK ON The lights all
flip on and A PINBALL MACHINE in the corner lights up and
starts going crazy with some obnoxious MUSIC

Cassie and Razor both CRY OUT in surprise

Cassie grabs the other pool cue and goes over to the window
Parts the curtains and starts ramming the pool cue into it

CASSIE
Come on Help me

Razor just looks around indecisive

Cassie keeps ramming the glass It’s thick and triple-paned
The first pane is starting to CRACK

CASSIE (CONTD)
Come on You think they don’t have
keys to their own locks

Razor looks up at the ceiling Notices an ATTIC ENTRANCE
He gets up on the pool table

CASSIE (CONTD)
What are you doing

Standing on the pool table Razor opens the attic entrance in
the ceiling and pulls down the folding stairs leading up to
it and hops off the table

RAZOR
There’s a hatch in the attic
Let’s you out onto the roof
Quicker than breaking a window

Cassie stops banging on the window but still looks less than
certain about this

RAZOR (CONT ’D)
Come on

Cassie comes over and starts climbing the stairs into the
attic Razor standing watch at the bottom with the pool cue

Cassie gets to the top of the stairs Pokes her head into
the attic It’s dark Expansive

RAZOR (CONTD)
Hurry up Get up there

She pokes her head a little further into the attic Looks
over to one side About fifty feet away a little moonlight’s
getting in Maybe that’s the hatch

A HAND REACHES OUT of the darkness and grabs her by the hair
Cassie SCREAMS

Kurt’s face emerges from the darkness of the attic Hes
crouched there right in front of her

Cassie wrenches away and tumbles down the stairs right on top
of Razor Both of them hit the floor hard and the pool cue
SNAPS and rolls across the room

Dazed but frantic Cassie scrambles up and runs over towards
the window where the other pool cue is

Razor looks over and notices one of the DOORS IS OPEN

RAZOR (CONT ’D)
Cass

Too late Gail is already on her She shoves Cassie to the
ground and PUNCHES her in the face

GAIL
Told you to stay put

She punches Cassie again She hits like a man

Razor’s up now but Kurt’s down from the attic like a flash

Kurt’s muscly arms wrap around Razor from behind He’s got
him in some kind of a hold and no matter how much Razor
struggles the hold only strengthens

Razor can see Gail hit the helpless Cassie yet again He
summons all his strength to free one of his hands

A flick of his wrist and his RAZOR BLADE falls into his hand

And just as fast Kurt grabs Razor’s hand and squeezes it
shut pushing the razor blade deep into Razor’s palm

RAZOR
Ahhhhhgh

Kurt SLAMS Razor’s head into the pool table and

EVERYTHING GOES DARK

INT BASEMENT - NIGHT

DARKNESS Razor BLINKS and we catch a glimpse of the
basement Labored desperate BREATHING from somewhere
nearby

Razor SNAPS awake He’s in a man-sized BIRDCAGE hanging by a
chain from the ceiling It CREAKS and RATTLES as he pulls
himself onto his knees and GROANS

He’s stripped down to his boxers covered in cuts and
bruises

The basement is dark and wet with stone walls an iron maiden
in one corner and a torture rack in another A stone table
covered in blood and bits of human bone This isn’t just a
basement this is a TORTURE CHAMBER

CASSIE (0OS)
Razor

Razor turns around to see two more birdcages hanging behind
him Cassie is in one of them bloodied about the face and
dressed only in her bra and panties

RAZOR
Cassie

CASSIE
I couldn’t tell if -- if you were
breathing I thought maybe you were
dead

Razor immediately starts fiddling with the lock on his cage

RAZOR
How long was I out
(a beat)
Cass

CASSIE
He they

She can’t bring herself to say it She just points past
Razor into a corner Razor slowly turns around to see what
Cassie’s pointing at

It’s JP - CRUCIFIED on an UPSIDE-DOWN CROSS

He’s not moving stripped down to bloodied briefs and his
whole body is covered in cuts and bruises as if he’s been
flogged His face is twisted into a horrific expression of
pain and terror

CAMERA MOVES AROUND behind the cross where there’s an extra
nail It’s going through the back of the cross -- and RIGHT
INTO JP’s ASS

RAZOR
(beat)
Jesus

CASSIE
They made me watch

She covers her face

RAZOR
Cass I-

CASSIE
Nobody knows where we are

RAZOR
Cass focus okay We gotta figure
somethin’ out here They’re
fuckin’ crazy They’re gonna
fuckin’ torture us Cass

Cassie just sits against the bars of her cage despairing of
life

CASSIE
I want my daddy

The sound of DEADBOLTS unlocking and Razor looks up as the
basement door opens and Kurt and Gail descend the staircase
They’re CARRYING SOMETHING in a big sack

They bring the sack over to the birdcages They’re only a
few feet away from Razor now

RAZOR
What’s goin’ on here man Huh

Gail looks Razor in the eyes and says nothing while Kurt
unties the top of the sack

Cassie glances over and starts to CRY Whatever’s in that
sack it can’t be good

RAZOR (CONTD)
I don’t know what I can say here
You think you’re gonna get away
with this Nobody gets away with
shit like this

Kurt opens the sack and reaches inside

KURT
You killed our hound

He pulls out the DOG’S MANGLED CARCASS
Razor recoils Cassie continues to cry
Kurt puts the dog carcass on the stone table

KURT (CONTD)
Do you kill to eat

Kurt takes a knife from the table and begins cutting the dog
into pieces

KURT (CONTD)
Did you kill our dog to eat it

RAZOR
Listen man do you want me to say
I’m scared Man I’m scared okay
You’re totally the one in control
here

Gail LAUGHS A feminine titter

Kurt cuts a swath of meat off the carcass and puts it ona
plate He takes the plate over to the birdcages Razor
shrinks from him but he passes by Razor’s cage and goes on
to Cassies

KURT
Eat
Cassie won’t reach for the plate She just CRIES

KURT (CONTD)
You killed it now eat it

CASSIE
No I -- I didn’t kill it

GAIL
Eat your supper dear

RAZOR
Leave her alone

Kurt and Gail look over at Razor

RAZOR (CONTD)
Yeah you heard me you
motherfuckers Leave her alone I
swear to god I will fucking cut you
into little pieces you fucking

KURT
Is that what you had planned for
us

Kurt and Gail turn back to Cassie

KURT (CONT’D)
(to Cassie)
Don’t you want some Aren’t you
hungry

GAIL
We’‘ll push it down your throat if
we have to sweetheart

KURT
(to Gail)
I think we’re going to have to make
her eat

GAIL
I knew she looked a little
anorexic I’1ll get the feeding
mask

RAZOR
Wait

Kurt and Gail ignore him

RAZOR (CONTD)
No wait I’‘ll eat it

That gets their attention

RAZOR (CONTD)
That’s right I’ll do it I want
to I want to eat it Give it to
me

He’s breathing hard Can’t believe he’s doing this
Kurt comes over to Razor’s cage with the meat

RAZOR (CONTD)
Not that one I want -- I want a
leg
(a beat)
Red meat

Kurt smirks goes over to the stone table to prepare a leg

Razor looks over at Cassie They lock eyes They might die

here and there’s nothing more intimate than that

Kurt brings over a dog leg on a plate Razor looks
reaches out and takes the plate Pulls it into the
him

RAZOR (CONTD)
Yeah Yeah that’s it I want it
I’m hungry

Razor’s near hysterics now pumping himself up for
a contestant on some sick version of “Fear Factor”

at it
cage with

this like

Razor TEARS INTO the dog leg with his teeth chews into fur
and blood and meat like an animal MOANING the entire time as
in the throes of passion tears rolling down his face

Kurt and Gail both smile

Cassie’s got no more tears She lays back against her cage

bars and shuts her eyes

INT BASEMENT - LATER

Cassie opens her eyes to the sight of Razor PUKING through

the bars of his cage Only bile and slime come out

everything else is already there in clumps on the floor

Razor slumps into a heap on the bottom of his cage

Violent SEXUAL NOISES - thrusting MOANING flesh SLAPPING at
flesh - come from a corner of the basement

Cassie looks over to see Kurt and Gail having sex against the
wall

Gail sees Cassie watching Gail smiles Cassie looks away
and Gail shifts her gaze to Razor

GAIL
(heavy breathing)
Razor Razor isn’t it Oh
Razor

Razor barely looks her way

Kurt and Gail separate for a moment and Gail walks over to
Razor’s cage For the first time we get a good look at
Gail’s TATTOOS

There’s a SWASTIKA on her inner thigh and another just above
the nipple of her right breast but the big one is on her
belly

It’s that OFF-KILTER PENTAGRAM at least six inches in
diameter encircling her navel

GAIL (CONTD)
It’s turning you on isn’t it
Looking at us

She touches her own breasts

GAIL (CONTD)
Don’t you wish Cassie had tits like
these

Kurt comes in behind Gail caresses her neck

GAIL (CONTD)
Don’t you wish you could touch
them Isn’t that why you came

KURT
What’s wrong child My wife
doesn’t arouse you She isn’t good
enough for you

Razor still doesn’t respond He just lays there in a heap
and shivers eyes half open

KURT (CONTD)
What about your little girlfriend
Does she turn you on

GAIL
I don’t think he can get it up

KURT
Cassie Cassie do something sexy
Stand up and do something sexy for
Razor Let’s see if he can get it

up
Kurt moves towards Cassie’s cage and she JOLTS BACK against
the other side making the cage swing back and forth

Kurt catches the cage and stops the swinging

GAIL
(to Razor)
Your little girlfriend’s going to
do something sexy Don’t you want
to watch Razor Don’t you want to
see your girl--

The DOORBELL RINGS
Kurt and Gail look at each other
Kurt walks over and looks at a TV MONITOR

KURT
The security guard

He glances at Razor to see if he heard him Razor still
looks catatonic

Gail quickly gets on her robe as does Kurt and they scurry
upstairs and out of the basement

Razor and Cassie hear them BOLT the door from the outside

Razor slowly gets up eyes on the door in case this is a
trick

RAZOR
(whisper)
Cassie

Cassie’s in a fetal position shaking and rocking back and
forth She might’ve lost it

RAZOR (CONTD)
We’re gettin’ out of here Cass

Razor pulls small bones out from beneath him The DOG-LEG
BONES from the leg he was forced to eat earlier

He breaks off one of the smaller ankle bones and twists it
into an “L” shape Then he takes another small bone and
reaches out of the cage and inserts it into the padlock like
a lock-pick He uses the other hand to insert the ”“L” shaped
bone as well uses it as a tension-wrench and goes to work
picking the lock

INT ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

Kurt and Gail all smiles talking with Percy the security
guard His golf cart is parked just outside

PERCY
A fight huh

He looks back out at the car CRUSHED against the tree and the
gaping hole in the garage door

Kurt leans closer to Percy with a knowing wink

KURT
Women

INT BASEMENT - NIGHT

Razor struggles with the lock his hand sweating He DROPS
the tension-wrench

But he’s able to SNATCH IT out of midair with the other hand
Shuts his eyes for a moment to gather himself

Cassie’s up now watching from her cage desperate

INT ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

PERCY
(to Gail)
Are you okay ma’am Do you need
to talk with me privately

GAIL
I’m perfectly fine It’s mostly my
fault really We like to come out
here to the mountains when we’re
stressed out and I guess we didn’t
get here soon enough this time did
we

Gail lets her robe slip just a little bit gives the guard a
bit of a distracting tit-show

PERCY
Well Well you’re gonna have to
get that cleaned up

KURT
It’ll be taken care of before lunch
tomorrow Scout’s honor

PERCY
All right well All right

KURT

Thanks so much for checking in

though Always good to know we’re

in such good hands
Kurt SHUTS THE DOOR He gives the closed door a mock NAZI
SALUTE and Gail chuckles
INT BASEMENT - NIGHT
Razor TWISTS the tension wrench and CLICK the lock comes
open
INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE BASEMENT - NIGHT

Kurt unlocks the deadbolts opens the door

INT BASEMENT - SAME
Kurt and Gail descend the stairs

GAIL
(sing-song voice)
Oh Razor I hope you didn’t get
off yet --

They stop near the foot of the stairs The CAGES ARE EMPTY

Razor now partially clothed emerges from behind the stairs
and SLAMS Gail with a SLEDGE HAMMER right in the crotch She
crumples

Kurt’s stunned for a moment then starts to LUNGE for Razor
but from the other side of the stairs Cassie also clothed
now PLUNGES a long knife through the BACK OF KURT’S KNEE

Kurt SCREAMS and tumbles headfirst down the stairs the knife
still protruding through the front of his leg

Razor stands over the writhing Kurt raises the hammer Kurt
puts up an arm to deflect the blow The arm CRACKS on
impact

KURT
Gahh

Gail’s getting up now trying to crawl towards Razor Cassie
KICKS Gail in the face takes another knife and STABS Gail in
the ribs

Gail rolls over and COUGHS UP BLOOD

Razor raises the hammer to hit Kurt again

CASSIE
Razor come on

Razor looks over at Cassie hesitates He wants to finish
the job

CASSIE (CONT’D)
Come on

Kurt YANKS the knife out of his knee GRUNTS with pain

Razor looks down at him Kurt SLASHES at Razor Razor jumps
back but the blade catches his leg

Razor falls

CASSIE (CONT’D)
Razor

Kurt goes for Razor with the knife but Razor flings the
hammer at him catches him on the JAW Kurt drops the knife
and collapses again

Razor gets up and runs up the stairs with Cassie blood
oozing from his leg

RAZOR
Fuck

INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE BASEMENT - SAME

Razor SLAMS the door shut and BOLTS it Cassie’s already
running down the hallway Razor follows wincing with every
step on his wounded leg He’s going as fast as he can wary
of every dark doorway he passes in the hall
EXT VACATION HOUSE - NIGHT

Cassie BURSTS out the front door looks back and forth
for anyone

CASSIE
Help Help

No answer The other houses are too far away
Razor limps out of the house

RAZOR
Percy Percy it’s me Percy

looks

It’s as loud as he can manage right now Still no answer

CASSIE
Where is he Why can’t he hear us
He was just here

Razor grabs Cassie’s arm and starts pulling her down the

driveway towards the street

RAZOR
We can’t wait around Come on
Cassie resists
CASSIE

The other houses We should go to
another house

RAZOR
No fucking way we gotta get outta
here

CASSIE

There’s nobody on that highway
It’s the middle of the night The
middle of the fucking night

RAZOR
No fucking way Cass

Cassie YANKS her arm free She’s freaking out Paces
way and then the other no idea what to do

RAZOR (CONTD)
They’re still alive down there

CASSIE
I don’t care Why do -- How can
you care How can --

one

She falls to her knees and VOMITS Nothing there but bile at
this point

RAZOR
They’1l just blame us They’1ll
fucking blame us Somehow make it
look like killing Stacy and JP was
self-defense
(a beat)
We’1l go to fucking jail

Cassie looks back towards the other houses She’s not
convinced

RAZOR (CONTD)

We either go back down there and
kill them and I ain’t opening that
door I can tell you that much or
we get out of here and hope they
die before someone finds them
because if we don’t those sick
fucks are gonna send us to jail

CASSIE
This wasn’t my idea

RAZOR
Cass come on

She shakes her head
RAZOR (CONTD)

So you’re gonna go to jail just
like your mom now

CASSIE
What
RAZOR
Just come on Cass
CASSIE
But you could tell them it wasn’t
my idea Tell them you -- you

took me out here and I didn’t know
what was going to happen

(off Razor’s blank

expression)
I mean that’s what happened

Razor takes her arm again

RAZOR
Let’s get down to the road

Cassie looks down the path to the other houses then back at
Razor She wrenches his arm away but follows him
EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Cassie and Razor in the woods headed for the road maybe 100
feet away

RAZOR
There’ll be a car don’t worry

Cold silence
RAZOR (CONTD)

Hey don’t be a bitch I just saved
your fucking life

CASSIE
For what So you can do me up the
ass

RAZOR
Cass-—

CASSIE

You’re just like JP

RAZOR
Hey JP was my friend and now he’s
fucking dead

Cassie stops walking

CASSIE
Fuck him And fuck you Talking
about my mom Talking about how I’m
gonna go to jail like my mom
‘cause you won’t even just tell the
truth about what happened

Razor puts a hand on Cassie but she knocks it away and sits
on the ground her back against a tree

RAZOR
Jesus Cassie come on we’re
almost there

CASSIE
You’re just like JP and my mom
and those fucking whores at my
school and everyone You’re
nothing
(a beat)
(MORE )

CASSIE (CONTD)
I wish they’d killed you too At
least they’re not losers like you
I’m glad your fucking dog got
killed
Razor holds up his hands in an “I give up” fashion

RAZOR
You are one crazy bitch

Cassie grabs a rock and throws it at Razor

CASSIE
Shut up

She throws another one and Razor heads back down towards the
road

RAZOR
Jesus

HEADLIGHTS down the road Coming this way Razor hobbles as
fast as he can for the road already waving his arms

Cassie makes no move to follow
RAZOR (CONTD)
(to the car)
Hey Heeeey

MOVEMENT in the trees catches Cassie’s attention and she
glances up

There in the branches of a tree close to the road is a MAN
He’s PERCHED UP THERE like some kind of a monkey Like he
has the agility of a cat And Razor’s headed right for him

Cassie hesitates then

CASSIE
Razor

Too late
Kurt POUNCES from the tree down onto Razor

Cassie stands up and GASPS but she can’t take her eyes off
of the struggle

Kurt and Razor are a jumble of flailing limbs there on the
forest floor It’s impossible to tell who’s winning

RAZOR
Fuck fu --

And then only a GURGLING sound

One of them’s stopped moving

Cassie stares frozen

The HEADLIGHTS of the passing car illuminate them for a
couple of seconds Long enough to see Kurt covered in
Razor’s BLOOD and slowly rising from where Razor’s now
butchered body lies He’s holding the same long knife Cassie
stabbed him with back in the basement

Kurt locks eyes with Cassie

Cassie runs back up the wooded hillside back towards the dim
glow of one of the houses Branches slap and scratch her

face in the darkness

Cassie stumbles on a stone looks back but there’s no sign of
Kurt

She’s up again running hard up the hill looks back again
still no sign of Kurt

AT THE TOP OF THE HILL

The woods end and there’s a clearing and about a hundred
yards away

ANOTHER HOUSE The lights are on The garage is open
Somebody might be home

Cassie crouches behind a big tree at the edge of the woods
working up the nerve to dash across that open space to the
house

She looks behind her up into the trees Kurt could be
anywhere

She creeps along the edge of the woods trying to get as
close to the house as she can before she makes a run for it
and then

A NOISE

Like a twig snapping

Cassie freezes AND THEN RUNS

Out into the clearing as fast as she can for the house
Nobody’s going to catch her she’s that determined but

before she’s gone ten yards

BIG HANDS GRAB CASSIE

Pull her to the ground Tackle her She’s in the grass
now the man on top of her

Cassie SCREAMS and a hand clamps over her mouth and that’s
when she sees it’s NOT KURT It’s Percy the security guard

PERCY
What are you doing out here kid
Huh

Percy shines his flashlight in Cassie’s face Recognizes her
and takes his hand off her mouth

PERCY (CONTD)
Wait you’re Razor’s girl Cassie
right

He helps her up

PERCY (CONTD)
I told you kids to stay outta
sight

Cassie’s shaking looking out at the woods not sure how much
to tell him

CASSIE
Can you -- Can you take me to that
house I need to use the phone

PERCY
No way what do you need to do that
for Where’s Razor at

CASSIE
Please please I’ve got to get toa
phone

She starts to move away toward the house but Percy grabs her
arm -- a little TOO ROUGH

PERCY
You didn’t answer my question
CASSIE
I -- I don’t know where he is
that’s why I need to -- to get toa
phone
Percy grins
PERCY

You little liar
Cassie shoots a frightened glance out at the woods

CASSIE
No no listen —-

PERCY
Got a little too rough for you
didn’t he Your first time

CASSIE
Please just get me to a phone
Please

PERCY

No reason to bother those people
I’m sure Razor’ll be along any
minute looking for you

(looks her up and down)
But since you kids decided to go
running around all over the place I
might just take me a little taste
what do you say

Cassie shakes her head tries to pull away

CASSIE
No No you don’t understand

Percy starts to pull her back into the woods

CASSIE (CONTD)
No They’1ll kill us They’1ll --

She fights him but Percy SLAPS her across the face

PERCY
You’re more trouble than you’re
worth you know that

Percy pushes her up against a tree
Cassie’s jaw stiffens Her eyes are cold

PERCY (CONTD)
Come on you know you’re gonna like
it Like mother like daughter
right

CASSIE
(emotionless )
You’re going to die

PERCY
(laughing)
That right

The breeze sways some branches high up in the trees just
enough to let some moonlight in Moonlight that illuminates

KURT

Still half-naked Bloody and bruised from the night’s events
and standing right behind Percy knife at his side

Cassie sees him Shuts her eyes

Percy yanks on Cassie’s pants and then Kurt’s hand is on his
shoulder

PERCY (CONTD)
Wha--

Kurt reaches his arm around and plunges the knife up into
Percy’s liver

Percy GASPS then GURGLES as blood fills his throat Hes
still conscious eyes wide and staring into Kurt’s as Kurt
gently lowers him to the ground

Kurt pulls out the knife and stands to face Cassie

Cassie opens her eyes

KURT
My wife is dead Cassie

A beat

CASSIE
Good

Kurt brings the knife close to Cassie She doesn’t flinch
He flips the knife around HANDING IT TO HER handle first

Kurt looks down at Percy twitching and gurgling gasping for
breath

KURT
Finish him

Cassie looks at Kurt At Percy his eyes looking up and
pleading with her At the knife She hasn’t taken it Not
yet

CUT TO BLACK

TITLES OVER BLACK

“Five Months Later”

CUT TO

INT GROCERY STORE - DAY

A podunk little country grocery store Must be near water
because a lot of the CUSTOMERS are dressed for the lake

Sandra and Paula two of the bitch cheerleaders from earlier
peruse the medicine aisle

They check the anti-theft mirror to make sure the CHECKOUT
GIRL isn’t watching then pocket little boxes of condoms

Sandra checks the mirror again and sees a flash of what could
be Cassie over on the next aisle

SANDRA
Oh my god

ON THE NEXT AISLE OVER

Sandra and Paula round the corner to see Cassie in a bikini
and a robe-like sheer cover-up browsing for sunscreen

SANDRA (CONTD)
Oh my god

Sandra and Paula go over to Cassie

SANDRA (CONTD)
Cassie Aren’t you supposed to be
dead or something Where have you
been for like the entire semester

Cassie completely ignores Sandra pulls some sunscreen down
and starts to walk away

Sandra and Paula cut her off at the corner Cassie doesn’t
look them in the eyes

SANDRA (CONTD)
Let me guess you came out to the
lake to drown yourself but you
couldn’t even get that right and
you were so embarrassed you just
stayed in the woods for the next
five months

Cassie uncrosses her arms and her cover-up parts revealing

The PENTAGRAM TATTOO around her navel -- the same tattoo Gail
had

SANDRA (CONTD)
Nice tat Glad to see you’re
getting in touch with your inner
skank

Cassie looks up at Sandra Her eyes are dead now There’s
nothing behind them

She reaches into her purse and produces
A NAZI SS SWITCHBLADE

SANDRA (CONTD)
What th--

CASSIE

PLUNGES the knife deep into Sandra’s belly ‘till even the
knuckles of her hand sink into the wound

BLOOD spurts back onto Cassie pours out of Sandra’s mouth

Paula SCREAMS

FADE OUT
