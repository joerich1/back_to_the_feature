EXT BORNEO JUNGLE - DAY

The dense Borneo jungle A 20 year old hippie (MERRITT
O’ KEEFE) appears jogging along a trail worn into the
underbrush

LOWER THIRD “BORNEO 1974”

As he jogs through the stunning beauty of the jungle
the customary HOWLS and SCREECHES of a thousand living
things accompany him

He’s being watched

He continues on unaware until-- the sounds of the jungle
abruptly GO SILENT He stops in his tracks All we can
hear is his BREATHING and the BEATING of his heart

But it’s not his heart It’s more mechanical He turns
around What he sees fills his face with horror

EXT BORNEO JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY - CONTINUOUS

OPEN ON SCREAMING NATIVES raising their spears and
surrounding a trio of terrified hippie PEACE CORPS
VOLUNTEERS They’ve been backed into a crude IRRIGATION
WATER WHEEL that is hitched to a goat

Before the angry natives can skewer the volunteers a
slightly older female volunteer (DR SALLY HASTINGS)
rushes onto the scene

DR HASTINGS
(Borneo tongue)
Stop Wait Stop

The natives calm slightly Hastings turns to her team

DR HASTINGS (cont’ d)
Larry what did you do

One of the volunteers LARRY DeMAIR responds

DeMAIR
We were just showing them how to
power the wheel

Larry points to the goat Hastings is aghast

DR HASTINGS
OH GOD Larry Goats are sacred
to these people It’s like making
Jesus Christ mow your lawn

A young society girl LIZZIE VAN PELT replies

LIZZIE
He went for a jog

An extremely shaken African American volunteer GEORGE
CARPENTER chimes in

CARPENTER
Now listen Dr Hastings this is
the Peace Corps I signed up to
help people not get killed by
fucking savages

He storms off as Dr Hastings continues to calm the
natives As they disperse one NATIVE points to Lizzie
and DeMair YELLING one last thing before leaving

DeMAIR
What’d he say

DR HASTINGS
Nothing Just that you’ve angered
the Gods and if the drought
continues they’11 hang you all
from your lower intestines

DeMair ruminates on this with comic concern

LIZZIE
(a bit taken)
Ooh so primal

A moment later a RUMBLE Everyone turns to the source
of the building sound The jungle

DeMAIR
What is that An earthquake

Flocks of BIRDS flee the jungle canopy And then as the
RUMBLE builds and the volunteers watch in awe an endiess
variety of animals STAMPEDE out of the brush

This epic sight is punctuated by O’ KEEFE staggering
behind the panicked animals into the clearing

O’ KEEFE
Run

The Man From UNCLE First Draft 12300 3

He falls to the ground revealing a myriad of darts in his
back The volunteers run to his aid just as the
deafening sound is upon them

Just then a flank of JEEPS breaks through the tree-line
carrying dart gun equipped RUSSIAN SNIPERS A moment
later three immense RUSSIAN HELICOPTERS arrive above
them with a THWACKING cacophony

As the helicopters descend on the helpless volunteers
the building wind blasts Lizzie’s face While she SCREAMS-

YUMMY SOUND and starts to open the package

EXT LONG ISLAND SOUND - DAY

OPEN CLOSE on LARRY DeMAIR now age 53 wind-whipped and
LAUGHING We soon reveal that he is waterskiing and Van
Morrison’s “Brown Eyed Girl” BLARES on the boat’s radio

At the wheel of the speedboat pulling him across the lake
is his daughter JACKIE (early 30’s) He signals to her
to turn up the music She smiles and obliges

EXT WATERFRONT DOCK - LATER THAT DAY

Before DeMair’s waterfront home Jackie secures the boat
to a piling as her father sheds his life preserver

DEMAIR
Staying for dinner

The Man From UNCLE First Draft 12300 6

JACKIE
Sorry Dad I gotta get going How
about next weekend

DEMAIR
Deal

Jackie gives him a peck on the cheek and exits DeMair
gets busy wrapping out the boat

A few moments later a VOICE with a thick RUSSIAN ACCENT

STRANGER (0S)
Mister Lawrence DeMair

DeMair looks up to see the STRANGER standing on the dock

DEMAIR
That’s me And you

As the Stranger speaks he surreptitiously moves his hand
to a DART GUN hidden in the small of his back

STRANGER
I am interested in purchasing
property in the area and I was
told you have lived here a very
long time

Totally unaware DeMair picks up a small cooler

DEMAIR
About twenty years

STRANGER
And I was wondering if you could
help me

The Stranger removes the gun and is about to bring it
around when

DEMAIR
(still unaware)
Sure but maybe you could help me
first Catch

DeMair tosses the cooler to the Stranger who
involuntarily tries to catch it The cooler KNOCKS THE
GUN from his hand and it falls to the dock

There is a moment of tense SILENCE as both men look at
the gun and then at each other

The Man From UNCLE First Draft 12300 7

The Stranger drops the cooler and grabs the gun Thinking
fast DeMair guns the throttle in reverse and releases
the knot in the mooring line

The boat races backward along the length of the dock as
the Stranger sprints close behind him

The boat clears the dock and just when DeMair thinks he’s
clear the Stranger LEAPS from the end of the dock --
LANDING ON THE WINDSHIELD OF THE BOAT

The Stranger brings the gun to bear DeMair grabs his
wrist As they struggle DeMair accidentally hits the
throttle into the forward position

EXT SOUND BOAT DAY - CONTINUOUS

The boat streaks along the shoreline at full speed as
DeMair struggles to keep the gun from his face

DEMATIR
Who are you

CRASH The gun goes flying as they STRIKE ANOTHER BOAT

DeMair realizes that they’ve entered the MARINA at top
speed when the Stranger lunges for his neck The
wrestling resumes as the boat CRASHES violently into
other boats

CRASH Another hit sends the Stranger flying aft and
slamming into the transom He scrambles to his feet to
find DeMair on his feet facing him

They stare each other down for a few moments until
inexplicably the Stranger calmly HOPS BACKWARD off the
boat and into the water

DeMair is puzzled and soon turns to discover why He lets
out a SCREAM as--

--THE BOAT HITS A BOAT RAMP shearing the fiberglass hull
as it rides up After a few seconds of air the boat
BARRELS INTO A TRI-LEVEL DRY DOCK loaded with boats

The Stranger watches from the water as the disastrous
impact decimates the structure -- reducing it to a huge
pile of debris

The Man From UNCLE First Draft 12300 8

EXT MARINA WRECKAGE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

As the dust settles DeMair’s body is visible in the
wreckage He has a head wound and his body twitches
erratically Convulsions follow as a few PEOPLE gather

DeMair’s spasms build then suddenly STOP His eyes SNAP
OPEN and the spectators watch in disbelief as he rises to
his feet

Ignoring offers of help he calmly walks away -- leaving
the people dumbfounded

The familiar skyline of New York City is visible as we
settle on the FBI field office

eventually spotting the handsome NAPOLEON SOLO as he
chats up a pretty young RECEPTIONIST at her cubicle
across the way

SOLO

shifts gears dramatically

of the older LIZZIE VAN HORN

SOLO (cont’d)
As you know ever since the
abduction of Lizzie Van Horn two
weeks ago the Bureau’s been
looking for a lead Oddly
despite her wealth and high
standing in the New York social
registry there have been no
ransom demands

(beat)

However my partner and I have
made a connection A link In
1974 Lizzie Van Horn was in the
Peace Corps stationed in Borneo
for a one-year tour along with six
other volunteers

The PHOTO of young Lizzie with the Peace Corps group in
Borneo appears on the screen

SOLO (cont’d)
Now I’11 cut to the chase-- we’ve
discovered that two other people
stationed on that island with her
have disappeared under similar
circumstances

The presentation zeros in on two of the volunteers in the
old photo O’KEEFE and DEMAIR

The Man From UNCLE First Draft 12300 13

SOLO (cont’d)
We don’t know who’s behind this or
why but the connection is clear
So we think we know where to go

Tourists pour off the ferry under the shadow of the
Statue of Liberty Among them are DeMair and Carpenter
DeMair taps the shoulder of an ELDERLY TOURIST and holds
out a Polaroid Camera

Excuse me sir Could you please
take a picture of me and my
friend

TOURIST
Of course

DeMair puts his arm around Carpenter and the tourist
snaps a photo of them in front of the statue Once done
DeMair’s face goes cold and he snatches the camera from
the old man

He proceeds to get right back on the ferry as Carpenter
walks olankly toward the Statue entrance After a few
steps he sheds his coat REVEALING A VEST COVERED IN
PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE

He’s quickly spotted by a WOMAN who starts a domino
effect of panic with her SCREAM And as the entire crowd
of tourists flee in chaos four SECURITY PERSONNEL
approach stone faced Carpenter with billy clubs

SECURITY 1
Hold it

He keeps walking Two of the men grab his arms

Then suddenly this seemingly out-of-shape 51 year-old
CPA dispatches them with a ruthlessly efficient series of
bone breaking KICKS and JABS- and continues toward the
building

The last of the Tourists flee the Statue entrance for
safety as Carpenter arrives pulling a DETONATOR from his
vest

With a push of a button a massive EXPLOSION SHATTERS THE

actually a FALSE ONE atop his real one

A look at the underside shows that it is made of a sharp-
edged METAL He uses it to CUT AN INCISION in his thigh

years I’m bored out of my mind and
I just gave up But I figure I’d
make the best out of a bad
situation Try to get as high up
as I could then retire early get
some cushy consulting gig or write
some made up tell-all book about
the FBI and rake it in Then it’s
off to the islands for days of
golf and tail I don’t even have
that now Serves me right

Wilson takes another swig

WILSON

(very drunk)
You know when I first heard about
this happening I was glad

SOLO
That’s okay buddy I know

WILSON
But now after talking to you I’m
absolutely thrilled I’ve never
liked you Solo and it’s not just
because you hit on my wife at my
son’s baptism it’s because you’re
unprofessional

Solo is still stone-faced
WILSON (cont’d)
And you know how I know that

The Bartender slides his glass away

BARTENDER
C’mon Solo I don’t know what
happened but it can’t be that bad

A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN sits next to Solo

BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
Haven’t seen you in awhile

SOLO
Go away

Solo’s glass and puts the bottle down next to it

About keeping the world from
falling into oblivion

SOLO
Listen buddy I’m 110 percent man--
Wait a minute what’d you say

WAVERLY
Perhaps youd like to join me and
my friend in the corner booth

Solo turns and squints into the dark back corner of the
bar to see Illya raising a glass to him Solo is shocked
for a moment then intrigued

SOLO
I guess I have some time

WAVERLY

Splendid Bartender two orders
of curly fries

Solo slides into the booth opposite Illya As they

stare each other down Waverly slides in next to his
associate

WAVERLY (cont’d)

Illya grabs Solo’s wrist and holds it on the table

SOLO
HEY What ar--

Waverly pulls out a syringe and jams it in Solo’s arm

SOLO (cont’ d)
Ow

WAVERLY
Please Mr Solo just a security
precaution If we wanted you dead
you’d be dead already

Solo suddenly looks as if he’s eaten a fistful of wasabi

SOLO
What the f- Ow my head Why do
I feel so so Oh no I’m sober

The Man From UNCLE First Draft 12300 28

WAVERLY
I apologize but you were
absolutely stinking

SOLO
Who the hell are you guys

WAVERLY
Imagine if you will an
intelligence organization that
takes all the resources of the FBI
and CIA Combine that with next
generation technology and then
cloak it all in absolute secrecy

(beat)

Then you would still barely be
scratching the surface of what we
are

SOLO
That’s a very good speech You
have my attention

WAVERLY
Mr Kuryakin show him

Illya produces a laptop computer He opens it and turns
the screen toward Solo

A PRESENTATION BEGINS with the photo of the Peace Corps
group in Borneo and goes on to illustrate the subsequent
debriefing

ILLYA
You know this photo 1974 Borneo
What you do not know is that these
volunteers were abducted by Soviet
Special Services and brainwashed
by Dr Vasily Kirenikova

WAVERLY
A bit of genius this Kirenikova
He developed a brainwashing
technique that allowed the subject
to be programmed to do unspeakable
things We’ve been looking for him
for years but with no luck

The Man From UNCLE First Draft 12300 29

ILLYA
In time of war the subjects were
to be activated and changed into
extremely dangerous soldiers to
destroy the infrastructure of the
United States

The Bartender appears with two orders of curly fries

BARTENDER
Here you go fellas

WAVERLY

Excellent

(resuming briefing)
Among other things our
organization was in the process of
finding these people in order to
surreptitiously de-program them
and return them to a normal life

ILLYA
But I accidentally activated one
of these human weapons-- Lawrence
DeMair I was trying to undo my
mistake when we met

WAVERLY
The long and the short of it is
The Statue of Liberty is just the
tip of the iceberg Since DeMair
was the first activated he will
now activate the remaining members
of his team and then proceed to do
untold damage to the United
States

Illya closes the laptop Solo can’t believe his ears

WAVERLY (contd)
Care to join us uptown Mr Solo

distinguished gentlemen

WAVERLY (cont’ d)
So each country nominated a
respected statesman to form a
completely independent watchdog
organization By the way that
handsome fellow there is my

They were called GIDEON the

They move on passing historical tableaus of moments in

rights struggle reads “PROJECT SELMA” another over
photos of fall of the Berlin Wall reads “OPERATION
WRECKING BALL” etc)

Solo smiles at this

WAVERLY (cont’d)
So What do you say

SOLO
Why me

WAVERLY
We’re an exclusive lot here Solo
There are only two ways we recruit
into the U-N-C-L-E You either
capture one of our agents or you
kill one of them Since you did
the first and nearly did the
second I’d say you are more than
qualified

It intensely quiet for a long time A long time Then

SOLO
Sorry I punched you in the face

say for myself

Solo shuts up The SILENCE returns Eventually

ILLYA (cont’d)
Are you going to ask me what I

mean
SOLO
Nope
More SILENCE Then
ILLYA

My incompetence caused activation
of DeMair And by allowing you to
capture me I am responsible for
destroying Statue of Liberty
symbol of American freedom

SOLO
Jeez don’t be so hard on
yourself I was the one who
captured you and kept you from

down the hall Solo pantomimes a “look around” gesture
to him and when Dr Hastings turns back they shift into
fake smiles

living room as Illya heads down the hall

hand but she grips it tight Then waving his hand
before her eyes

SOLO (cont’d)

THWACK She hits Solo in the head with the phone
Before he knows what hit him she wraps the cord around
his neck-- standing up and choking him like a well

Solo struggles against the cord when she grabs a nearby
fireplace shovel and CLANG CLANG CLANG strikes him
repeatedly as he attempts to back away

She lets go of the cord and finishes Solo with a two-

Illya pulls out a Zippo lighter and turns the striker
wheel like a selector switch

Illya and Solo enter the room to get a better look Solo
scans the wall of animal trophy heads eventually coming
upon a slightly ajar cabinet

ILLYA

What’s that

He creaks it open to reveal a GUN CABINET It’s empty
except for a few loose ELEPHANT ROUNDS

SOLO
Nothing just an empty gun cabine--
Shit

BLAM An elk’s head next to Illya EXPLODES He dives as
another shot BLOWS A HOLE in the wall next to Solo

They look to the closet to see Sally reloading a big game
rifle and raising it to take aim

They scramble for the door and DIVE just as Sally FIRES
BOTH BARRELS

INT HASTINGS UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The dooriamb SPLINTERS from the gunshot as Illya and Solo
DIVE through the doorway Solo CRASHES INTO THE STAIRWAY
RAILING as Illya FLIES OVER IT and out of sight

Solo scampers around the railing and down the hall as
Sally emerges reloading the rifle and following him

Solo gets to a door only to find it locked He struggles
with the knob as Sally approaches- snapping the rifle
shut She raises it and Solo cringes slightly-- trying
to accept his fate

The Man From UNCLE First Draft 12300 42

What neither of them see is Illya rising into frame one-
handedly pulling himself up the railing

And just as Sally starts squeezing the trigger Illya
shoots a dart into her neck She doesn’t go down right

away but pauses long enough to realize what happened

She returns to her task of aiming at Solo her finger
straining to pull the trigger

It’s a tense moment and finally she collapses - the gun
FIRING as she hits the ground

Solo can’t believe he’s alive Both men look to Solo’s
feet to see a huge hole in the floor millimeters away

They can see clear through to the first floor Then as
they turn and face each other

INT UNCLE INFIRMARY - LATER THAT DAY

Solo’s wounds are being tended to by a beautiful NURSE

to find the book The mere sight of it has him
salivating He reaches for it

Illya pulls it away and prompts him to continue He can’t
resist Finally Kirenikova begins talking in ENGLISH

DR KIRENIKOVA
I know which group you are
tracking They were programmed to
sabotage the infrastructure of the
United States in time of war
Demoralize the populace by
destroying their greatest symbol
the Statue of Liberty Then
incite chaos and confusion by
crippling the power grid But
their final mission It is the
death blow And it will destroy
the beating heart of the wretched
American ideal

So what is it

DR KIRENIKOVA
Tell you Why should I reveal to
you what will make me a hero of
the Republic and restore me and my
country to our proper place

ILLYA
You are talking gibberish old man

DR KIRENIKOVA
When they achieve their goal I
will see you and yours starve
Starve like Russia now starves
And they will rise up in
desperation as they did in that
October so many years ago And
they will tear everything you
believe in apart You see America
is a paper tiger

resist pain beyond anything you
can imagine They are resourceful
Deadly Devious This is how I

only way to stop them is to kill

first

He breaks into a DEVIOUS LAUGH and reaches for the book
As Illya and Solo rise to their feet Illya TOSSES IT IN

Two young BOYS play in the cockpit until a VEFW who
babysits the plane appears

EXT HANGAR - A SHORT TIME LATER - NIGHT

Illya and Solo creep cautiously to the hangar using
smaller service buildings as cover

The Man From UNCLE First Draft 12300 86

Soon enough they round a corner into an alley adjacent
to the hangar only to find--

SOLO
Shit

-- a knee-high grid of LASER sensors blanketing the
perimeter of the hangar

Illya points to a FIRE DOOR at the other end of the
sensor ridden alleyway

ILLYA
We’ll enter there

Solo watches curiously as Illya calmly reaches into his
rucksack and pulls out a VHS-cassette-sized ROBOTIC
DEVICE He puts it on the ground and activates it

The robot quickly rolls under the beams while PFHHT
PFHHT PFHHT PFHHT precisely firing a series of
miniature prisms onto the walls on either side of the

Illya jumps to his feet to find O’ Keefe standing there

They are instantly in a blinding flurry of close quarters

Solo scrambles off the ground and dives into O’ Keefe like
a linebacker The tackle sends O’ Keefe and Solo through
the window of an adjacent office with a CRASH

The crash alerts Lizzie and DeMair who gives her a
signal before unholstering two guns and opening fire on

Meanwhile Illiya and DeMair continue their shoot-out

down behind some of the junked military surplus

At the same time in the office O’ Keefe swings Solo into
a sheetrock wall-- mounting him in it As Solo recovers
from the blow O’Keefe pulls him out of the wall and
throws him across the room THROUGH ANOTHER WINDOW

He lands a few yards from Illya out in the open DeMair
spots him and Illya knows it

As Solo scampers for cover Illya decides to make a break
for it as a distraction With impressive acrobatics he
dives out from behind the surplus firing wildly He hits
DeMair in the shoulder sending him to the ground

Illya lands next to Solo and they scramble to their feet

yards above Solo Illya and the bomb close the distance
at roughly the same rate

more labored for air They are just a few yards from the
well when--

The PRESSURE SENSOR SWITCH on the bottom of the bomb
touches the ground and--

A white hot magnesium charge BLOWS atop the bomb to
detonate the cloud of gas vapors

into the well followed a beat later by Illya

EXT SKY ABOVE NEW JERSEY - A SHORT TIME LATER

The B-52 roars over the landscape toward the New York
skyline on the distant horizon

INT B-52 - COCKPIT - DAY - CONTINUOUS

O’ Keefe and Lizzie pilot the plane An electronic box
has been patched into the instrument panel Lizzie turns
it on

EXT SKY ABOVE NEW JERSEY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

The plane continues toward the skyline when from behind
the UNCLE G-2112 TACTICAL JET DROPS INTO FRAME

The plane catches up with the B-52 and flies at matching
speed a short distance above it Eventually bomb bay-
type doors open up underneath

From inside Illya is lowered on a harness down to the
top of the B-52 fuselage Battling the fierce wind he
makes it to the surface and quickly attaches a magnetic
clamp which provides him with a handhold

Once secure he uses the other hand to stick an eight
foot length of CORD in the shape of a four-foot circle on
the fuselage

With a flip of a switch on a detonator the cord gets
white hot and MELTS into the body of the plane In
moments the four-foot circular shape falls into the plane
with a CLANG

O’ Keefe and Lizzie hear the noise but Lizzie returns to
making adjustments on the electronic box

INT B-52 - REAR HOLD - CONTINUOUS

Illya lowers himself through the hole He anchors a
heavy gauge D-ring on the deck of the plane using a
riveting device placed on the end of his pistol

A moment later he removes the cable from his harness and
clips it to the D-ring He looks up through the hole and
gives a thumbs up

INT G-2112 JET DAY CONTINUOUS

Solo and the Strike Team are looking down from the bay
doors The STRIKE LEADER clips a pulley onto the cable
and quickly drops out of the plane As the remaining
team members do the same--

SOLO
Would it kill you guys to have a
class Just one fucking class

The Tech grabs him clips him on and pushes him out

INT B-52 - REAR HOLD - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Solo drops into the hold with a SCREAM and smashes onto
the deck

SOLO
Jesus

Illya ignores him and addresses the Strike Leader
ILLYA
Take the cockpit we will deal
with the bomb

The Strike Leader unhooks the cable and waves off the
plane

The G-2112 peels off just as the B-52 roars over the
coastline of New Jersey and draws dangerously close to
New York City

INT B-52 - GANGWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

The Strike Team creeps toward the cockpit The Leader
peers around a corner and spies on them

STRIKE LEADER

INT B-52 - BOMB BAY - CONTINUOUS

A hatch opens to reveal Illya and Solo entering the bomb
bay What they see horrifies them

It’s EMPTY There is NO BOMB on the plane

SOLO
It’s a decoy

ILLYA
(into headset)
There is no bomb on the plane
Repeat

INT B-52 - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

As the strike team rushes the cockpit they are greeted by
the sight of dozens of bricks of plastic explosives
strapped to Lizzie and 0’ Keefe’s chairs

ILLYA (0S)
(over headset)
There is no bomb on the plane It
is a trap

Lizzie and O’ Keefe calmly remove their hands from the
controls and exchange a glance She pushes a button on
the box and--

-BOOM Fire fills the frame

INT B-52 - BOMB BAY - CONTINUOUS

Illya and Solo are knocked to the ground by the violent
explosion As soon as they can they scramble out the
door

INT B-52 - GANGWAY - DAY

They arrive at the front of the plane to discover the
entire cockpit and nose gone All they see is New York
Harbor and the skyline about a mile ahead

And as the plane stalls--

ILLYA
Follow me

Illya calmly dives out of the gaping front of the plane

SOLO
Shit

Solo bites his lip and jumps out with another SCREAM

EXT SKY OVER NEW YORK HARBOR - DAY

The plane goes into a dive as Illya and Solo drop from
it The falling pitching beast nearly swats them out of
the sky as it passes

Once clear Solo and Illya open their chutes

EXT BATTERY PARK -— DAY

Beautiful Battery Park In the FAR BACKGROUND we can see
several giant cranes on Liberty Island hoisting the
Statue of Liberty out of the water

A moment later the B-52 dives into frame-- COLLIDING
into the Statue and EXPLODING

After a beat Solo and Illya glide in touching down
safely in the park

SOLO
We’ll get blamed for that

As they detach their chutes

The Man From UNCLE First Draft 12300 107

Se ILLYA

DeMair must have the bomb

SOLO
What Another plane

ILLYA
No From the ground He need
only get it 500 feet above the
target and it works just the same

A moment

SOLO
Then I know where it is

Solo takes off and Illya follows

EXT WATER STREET — DAY

Jackie is kneeling reaching OFF SCREEN with a helpful
hand

JACKIE
C’mon It’s okay C’mon It’s
me

We soon see she’s talking to her father as he meekly
emerges from a narrow alleyway

JACKIE (cont’d)
What are you doing here

DEMAIR
That’s a very good question

JACKIE
It’s going to be okay now I
promise

DEMAIR
I don’t know how I got here
It’s been a very strange couple
of days Weeks I probably
shouldn’t have taken all that acid
in college

Jackie smiles
JACKIE
Come on Dad Let’s get you back
home

EEE EEE a a a eee
The Man From UNCLE First Draft 12300 108

DEMAIR

those bulbs
JACKIE

Don’t worry about th--

SOLO (0OS)
FREEZE

Solo and Illya are standing a few yards away with guns
drawn Jackie and her father are both shocked

JACKIE
What are you doing
SOLO
Get away from him
JACKIE
He’s fine now he’s fine
SOLO
You don’t understand just step
away
ILLYA
I have a shot
JACKIE
What the hell are you doing
SOLO
(to Illya)

Wait
(to Jackie)
Jackie step away

She instead steps in front of her father

DEMAIR
Jackie who are they What’s
happening

SOLO

He’s dangerous I couldn-

ILLYA
I have a shot

The Man From UNCLE First Draft 12300 109

SOLO
Illya wait--
(to Jackie)
I couldn’t tell you

ILLYA
Enough

BANG Illya fires a warning shot at their feet
Startled DeMair jumps backward and falls giving Illya
and Solo a chance to get between him and his daughter
Adrenaline is running high as Illya and Solo cover him

SOLO
Stay down Where is it
DEMAIR
What
JACKIE

What are you doing You said you
wouldn’t hurt him You promised
me

ILLYA
Where is the weapon

DEMAIR
What What did I do Don’t
shoot me Jesus Christ

DeMair starts to twitch as the argument continues

JACKIE
You promised me

SOLO
You don’t know what he’s capable
of What he’s done What he’s
going to do

JACKIE
But he’s fine now

WHACK DeMair is bad again and ready to kick ass He
kicks the gun out of Illya’s hand and manages to deliver
a crushing blow to his voicebox before catching the
pistol Then as Illya collapses gasping for air DeMair
does an Aikido flip and grabs his daughter

Before Solo can even register it DeMair has his daughter
hostage with Iliya’s pistol

The Man From UNCLE First Draft 12300 110

SOLO
Drop the gun

JACKIE
Daddy

DeMair begins rapidly backing up off the sidewalk and
across the street Solo stays on him during his retreat
until he has him backed up against the side of a truck
cab

It’s hitched to a trailer and a cargo container marked
with the familiar logo of Trans-World-Global Shipping

SOLO
Let her go

DeMair reaches down by his knee and unclips a latch on
the truck’s underslung fuel tank which FLIPS OPEN to
reveal a CONTROL PANEL With one press of a button--

Hydraulics HISS and WHINE as the cargo container begins
to tilt upright as if on the back of dump truck Solo
and Jackie watch in awe as it rises into an upright
position while Illya is regaining his composure across
the street

Once fully up the cargo container’s sheet steel sides
fall away like flower petals revealing the now complete
framework assembly (that DeMair was welding together in
the hangar)

Inside this structure fashioned from surplus army
munitions is a SCUD-like missile with THE BOMB built
into its upper stage

Illya can’t help but be moved

ILLYA
Fucking brilliant

He makes his way toward Solo

ILLYA (cont’d)
Shoot now Both of them

DeMair activates a fifteen second timer He still hides
behind his hostage

ILLYA (cont’d)
Shoot

The Man From UNCLE First Draft 12300 111

SOLO
I can’t--

11 10 The rocket IGNITES with a throaty HOWL
Smoke billows

ILLYA
NOW

Solo strains to find a clean shot Jackie is horrified
by everything that goes on around her

ILLYA (CONTD)
Give me the gun I’11 do it

Solo pushes Tilya away 9 8

With no other option Solo steels himself and takes a
moment to aim

BANG He hits DeMair in the shoulder He staggers back
letting go of Jackie

DeMair quickly regains his composure and Jackie watches
in horror as her own father takes aim to kill her He
squeezes the trigger

BANG BANG BANG Solo shoots DeMair before he can fire
Demair hits the asphalt facing his daughter

Solo is dumbstruck as Illya rushes for the control panel
With speedy skill he is able to yank off the panel and
pull out a circuit board powering down the rocket

Fading fast DeMair is able to share a final moment face
to face with his daughter With a loving smile he
briefly returns to her

DEMAIR
Everything’s gonna be okay

and he dies

And as people crowd around Jackie rises to her feet
Wiping tears from her eyes she gathers herself and walks
over to Solo Hands shaking he holsters his weapon He
looks Jackie in the eyes

SOLO
I’m sorry I --

Jackie SLAPS him hard across the face and singes him with
her teary eyes

The Man From UNCLE First Draft 12300 112

SOLO (contd)
Jackie waitI --
JACKIE
(turning to leave)
Mission accomplished

Congratulations

She runs away and disappearing into the crowd Solo
watches her go unable to move

As sirens WAIL and the crowd thickens ever more

FADE OUT

EXT NEW YORK CITY OFFICE PLAZA - WEEKS LATER - DAY

Napoleon leans against a post-modern statue watching the
throng of New York City rat racers at lunch hour

It isn’t long before he spots Jackie emerging from the
building

He watches her every move from a distance but doesnt
have the courage to approach

After a few moments of contemplation
ILLYA (0S)
It is like Waverly says “Missions
are often not what they seem”

Illya approaches with hot dogs surprising Solo

ILLYA (contd)

Hot dog
SOLO

What are you doing here
ILLYA

I’m bringing you a hot dog
SOLO

I don’t want a hot dog
ILLYA

Next time you leave the women to

Illya hands Solo an envelope

The Man From UNCLE First Draft 12300 113

ILLYA (cont’d)

As Solo continues to watch Jackie walk away he opens the

envelope and pulls out the CHECK He is amazed at what
he sees

SOLO

His eyes drift back to Jackie as she walks away

ILLYA
You did the right thing you know

SOLO
Yeah I know I’m just glad for
her that it’s over

Still watching her
