JON (V0O)
Will they come for me -- and try to
torture it out of me Or do I just wait
here for the end of the world Maybe I
won’t even know when the end comes I’11
just live out the rest of my life on this
island Maybe that means I’m luckier
than you

MOTION PICTURE SCREEN - PROJECTED FILM IN PROGRESS

The film is in BLACK and WHITE circa 1930’s BIBLICAL EPIC
ACTORS in ROBES SANDALS SOUNDTRACK MUSIC -- very
Wagnerian A NON-DIALOGUE SEQUENCE a CROWD follows a MAN
who’s only seen from behind

The film’s speed SLOWS Music gets distorted A BARELY
DISCERNIBLE EFFECT the HEADS of the people in the crowd seem
to slightly PULSE as if changing SHAPE

The film SLOWS MORE FLICK FLICK FLICK -- the crowd moves
more slowly The FLICKER between frames is more visible
PUSH IN CLOSER ON -- the HEADS of the people in the crowd
In FLASHES the heads MORPH into HIDEOUS DEMON HEADS a
horrific ARRAY

CROSSFADE TO
EXT OLD 30’S-ERA BUILDING - DAY

With a SIGN “UCLA FILM PRESERVATION PROJECT”
INT LAB ROOM

A clean-cut Jon Gates a little nerdy albeit handsome
slowly works a WET GATE OPTICAL PRINTER

CLOSE ON - PRINT GATE

Jon advances an old haggard FILM frame by frame Each
succeeding frame stops under a BRIGHT PROJECTOR LIGHT and a
COPY of the frame is PRINTED onto a BLANK FILM STOCK The
next frame moves into position then the next

Then the old film won’t advance CLICKS of Jon attempting to
turn the lever The frame that still sits under the bright
hot light begins to MELT --

-- And suddenly BURSTS INTO FLAME in an EXPLOSIVE MANNER
making a sharp hissing noise

WIDE ON LAB

Jon flinches back as -- MORE of the old film IGNITES with a
SHRILL WHISTLING SOUND and enough explosiveness to VIBRATE
the machine

Jon rapidly reaches for the reel of the old film gripping it
to yank it off the arm -- but -- all of the old film on the
reel EXPLODES into FLAME

JON
AHHHH

Jon whips his hands back His left hand has a SERIOUS BURN
The reel BLOWS LOOSE and ROCKETS onto the top of a table
knocking over some bottles The fluid from one of the
bottles IGNITES FILM CANISTERS on SHELVES nearby loom
ominously

DR GORDON RITTENAUER 60s beard and glasses throws open
the door rushes inside seizes a FIRE EXTINGUISHER and
SPRAYS FOAM all over the flaming table

INT OPEN WORKSPACE AREA - UCLA ARCHIVES
Jon and Gordon sit by a desk near the open lab door where
some smoke emerges in wisps Jon has an ICE PACK on his

hand

JON
I’m so sorry Gordon

GORDON
Don’t be silly I’m glad you’re okay
JON

The film got stuck
GORDON

I figured
JON

How did nitrate stock ever get projected
without blowing up

GORDON
Who says it didn’t

Gordon puts his hand on Jon’s shoulder squeezes

GORDON (cont’‘d)
Let’s be thankful that it was only a
newsreel

INT JON’S HONDA CIVIC - MOVING - LATER

Gordon smoking a cigarette which he holds outside the
window rides in the passenger seat Jon pulls to a stop in
front of a FRUMPY OLD HOUSE Gordon starts to get out

GORDON
You want to watch that Kidlat Tahimik
movie I’11 make my famous baked Alaska

JON
Uh well I can’t I’m going out with
Sharkey It’s a screening of “Blue
Angel” at Chipsey Goldstone’s mansion

GORDON
Ah -- High society

JON
Well Sharkey’s just going as the
projectionist And I’m his tag-along

GORDON
Have fun Thanks for the ride

Gordon ambles to his front door Jon watches him with a
trace of sadness then leans to the passenger window --

JON
But let’s do it tomorrow night

Gordon turns back gives him a weak smile

over his notes on a big calender for upcoming programming

JON
Sharkey why don’t you ever throw in some
Truffaut or Goddard

SHARKEY
My theatre my mojo

TWO THEATRE WORKERS move around the area cleaning One is a
SCRAWNY BOY KIRK He says “hi” to Jon with the “Spock” hand
sign from “Star Trek”

KIRK
Sharkey’s the God of Scheduling

Jon sees a FEMALE WORKER AMY who’s a pretty teenager

JON
Who’s that

SHARKEY
Amy Just hired her yesterday She’s a
film buff -- very buff

EXT GOLDSTONE MANSION - BEL AIR - NIGHT

VALETS on the main road park the arriving cars Sharkey’s
BEAT UP OLD VAN evades the valets and digs into a spot that’s
half on the road and half in some ivy-covered ground Out
comes Sharkey Jon -- and Amy

INT MASSIVE HOME THEATRE - LATER
The PARTY is in full swing Seventy overstuffed SEATS in
rows face an exhibition-sized SCREEN The GUESTS all swarm

around the REAR of the seating area with cocktails

Jon is with Sharkey and Amy in a corner They sip drinks
scan the faces

AMY
Hey -- over there it’s --
JON
Don’t say any names out loud That marks
us as gawkers

AMY
Brad Pitt

INT LARGE OPEN ATTIC - LATER

Sharkey leads Amy and Jon into the dim attic There are
HUNDREDS of METAL FILM CANNISTERS stacked everywhere The
whole collection is in disarray Sharkey pokes around
looking at fading TAPE STRIPS with TITLES

SHARKEY
Chipsey’s not too organized Since his
old man died the collection is a mess

Jon stares around the whole attic in disgust

JON
Storing film in here It’s criminal

Jon has started looking at titles he stops at one IN
HORROR nearly hyperventilates

JON (CONTD) (contd)
He has Murnau’s “Faust” There’s only a
handful of prints in the world

Jon opens one of the CANNISTERS containing “FAUST” inspects
the film

JON (contd)
Sharkey -- it’s starting to ROT

SHARKEY

through the glass at the theatre stage --

INT HOME THEATRE

-- As CHIPSEY GOLDSTONE 40’s dapper in attire steps in
front of the screen with a YOUNG WOMAN The crowd all
seated becomes quiet The Woman is early thirties dressed
like a post-modern version of a Parisian cafe BOHEMIAN Her
comportment is regal She’s stunningly good-looking
CHIPSEY
Now a few words from Claire Swann

CLAIRE
First I want to thank Chipsey His late
and great father Ira amassed quite a
collection of films and it’s very
generous for his son to grace us with
these wonderful screenings

APPLAUSE from the crowd Chipsey smiles
CLAIRE (contd)

As some of you know I’m a great lover of
old films I’ve been called a celluloid
archaeologist

Scattered chuckles

INT PROJECTION ROOM

They watch Claire Jon fidgets shifts position

JON
That’s what Claire Swann looks like

AMY
Who is she

SHARKEY
One of the film critics at the LA Weekly

CLAIRE
A film classic is an expression of its
moment in history “Der Blaue Engel” is

von Sternberg’s cynical rendering of
moral degradation that mirrored the
debasement of the Weimar Republic

SHARKEY
She talks like she writes

JON
Like an egotistical bitch

SHARKEY
Half the film-going audience in town
considers her a joke
JON
And the smarter half
(begrudging hating it)
knows she’s always right

CROSSFADE TO
INT PROJECTION ROOM - LATER

CLOSE ON Sharkey -- as he changes a reel He turns and sees -
- only Amy

SHARKEY
Where’s Jon

Amy shrugs Sharkey peeks out at the ballroom sees Chipsey
reacting to Jon whispering in his ear Chipsey gets up and
heads for the booth

SHARKEY (contd)
Oh shit

The door opens Chipsey enters with Jon following

CHIPSEY
Sharkey who is this interesting young
fellow

SHARKEY

Jon Gates He’s uh --

CHIPSEY
He’s so serious I think he’s going to
have me arrested

JON
I’m just suggesting for proper storage
some kind of temperature controls --

CHIPSEY
(sexily)
I guess I have a problem controlling my
temperature

SHARKEY
(to Jon)
Don’t dis the host man

CHIPSEY
It’s okay I promise to take better care
of those old films Scout’s honor

The FILM BREAKS Sharkey rapidly moves to rectify the
situation Chipsey smiles wryly at Jon
CHIPSEY (CONTD) (cont’d)
That’1ll teach me

Chipsey leaves the room Jon reacts with bewildered ire
then gazes out at the theatre

Jon spots Claire who turns to look toward the projector
Her eyes meet Jon’s They lock for a beat

Sharkey gets the film taped He re-starts the projector
Jon leaves

SHARKEY

Jon Where are you going
INT LARGE OPEN ATTIC - MOMENTS LATER
Jon creeps toward the reels of “FAUST” There are FOUR of
them 20-minute 35mm Jon tries to carry TWO but can only
manage ONE at a time
He turns and slowly starts back to the door There’s a CREAK
from across the attic He stops A beat No sound He
starts forward again As he gets closer to the door his
peripheral vision catches something and he turns
-- IT’S AN OLD MAN STARING AT HIM He GASPS and almost
drops the cannister He sinks to his knees to keep it from

hitting the floor and it BANGS

JON
I was just uh --

-- It’s a WAX FIGURE -- from a 50’s B MOVIE -- ruined by the
heat melted into a hideous humanoid appearance

INT STAIRCASE

Jon slowly creeps down a long staircase He gets to the base
of the stairs and darts into --

INT KITCHEN

Where he huddles against a pantry to hide from the SERVICE
WORKERS He sees a back door

Jon emerges avoids being seen by Valets on the driveway
EXT SIDE OF ROAD

Jon gets to Sharkey’s van He sets down the cannister
unlocks the side door He throws it open He picks up the
cannister sets it inside --

-- and a PUFF of SMOKE blows all over him He turns to see --

-- Claire smoking a cigarette staring at him

CLAIRE
What are you doing
JON
I’m taking this film to be restored
CLAIRE
Chipsey told you to
JON
o Yes
CLAIRE
Prove it Let’s go ask him
JON
Okay look -- I’m secretly borrowing this

film in order to save it

CLAIRE
Who the hell are you

JON
Jon Gates I’m a film restoration expert
for the UCLA Preservation Project I
specialize in positive to negative
reconstruction and I’ve contributed
research to various articles in Cahiers
Du Cinema and --

CLAIRE
Did I ask you to spew out your resumé
Youre a thief

JON
Look It’s Murnau’s “Faust”

Claire reacts with visceral deep interest -- as Jon opens
the cannister

JON (contd)
The outer edge is starting to rot
Goldstone stores his films in the attic
with no temperature or humidity control

CLAIRE
The proper thing to do is convince
Chipsey --
JON
Do you know him
CLAIRE
Yes
JON
And you could convince him
CLAIRE
(conceding)

--- No

Claire’s demeanor changes She stares at the film unable to
mask a growing concern Jon goes in for the kill

JON
Youre this great advocate for the
sanctity of classic film What kind of
hypocrite would you be if you helped
condemn this refugee piece of art back to
its death house

CLAIRE

How do I know you’re legit
JON

Follow me to the archives
CLAIRE

I will
JON

Okay First you can help
She stares at him CUT TO
INT ATTIC
Jon and Claire get on opposite sides and lift up the three
remaining cannisters carrying them together They strain
bump into stacks of other films struggle toward the door

INT STAIRCASE

They slowly sneak down trying to keep hold of the
cannisters Claire on the lower end

They HEAR the sounds of GUESTS’ CHATTERING getting louder --

What do you say

Claire looks at the cannisters then looks at the group She
smiles her arrogant guard is down She’s a film geek too

CLAIRE
Yeah

Sharkey and Amy get into the van Claire and Jon get into
the Peugot

Sharkey’s engine STARTS for a quick beat then DIES In that
sudden window of silence --

AMY
-- Now he likes her

Sharkey starts the engine and pulls the van away
INT CLAIRE’S PEUGOT
Claire starts her car with a wry look at Jon

CLAIRE
So now you like me

JON
She misunderstood something I said

CLAIRE
Mm-hm
INT CLAIRE’S PEUGOT - MOVING - LATER

As Claire drives she casts an appraising look at Jon

CLAIRE

You have a degree in film
JON

Bachelors UCLA What about you
CLAIRE

A Masters in critical studies from NYU
JON

(trying to joke)
Ah then you don’t watch films -- you

consider them

CLAIRE
Quite true So tell me do you enjoy
doing restoration work on films

JON
Yeah I feel like it’s important

CLAIRE
It is

She keeps her eyes on the road Jon smiles at her

INT SHOWART PROJECTION BOOTH - LATER

Jon and Sharkey move an OLD 35MM PROJECTOR into place the
usual one is off to the side

Jon and Sharkey open the cannister labeled “1” Claire
flicks her lighter about to light a cigarette

JON
WHOA

SHARKEY
NITRATE

Amy looks wide-eyed at all of them Claire flicks off her
lighter showing deep embarrassment

CLAIRE
Sorry I wasn’t thinking

Jon cannot open the canister He looks closely at it

JON
This canister is soldered shut

CLAIRE
What That’s crazy

Sharkey moves to the table

SHARKEY
Never seen that before

Sharkey digs around a mess of various tools objects on the
table He lifts a CAN OPENER

CLAIRE
Are you seriously going to --

JON
Be careful

Sharkey digs the can opener into the edge of the canister and
begins to turn it A LOUD HISS emerges from inside the
canister

Jon and Sharkey lift the first reel out of canister 1 They
set it on the table Jon notices an AGED BROWNED SLIP of
PAPER -- with GERMAN WRITING He grabs at it it’s STUCK so
it RIPS in half He carefully pulls the other half loose

He and Sharkey and Claire look at it

CLAIRE
Just a packing slip

Jon turns both halves over and holds them together There’s
a VERY FAINT FADED HAND-DRAWN DIAGRAM It’s an
ASYMMETRICAL PATTERN of SQUARES each SQUARE has a different
NUMBER inside

Jon puts the two torn pieces into his pocket He sees a
SHORT STRIP of PURE BLACK FILM running along the edge of the
cannister He tries to remove it but it’s STUCK

AMY
What is that

JON
Scrap

Sharkey closely scrutinizes the film’s first REEL

SHARKEY
Sound strips Isn’t “Faust” silent
Maybe this is a newer print with some
soundtrack music slapped-on

CLAIRE
(sarcastic)
Spectacular

JON
-- But why would a newer print be
nitrate

Sharkey takes the film to a table starts threading it under
a powerful MAGNIFYING LENS

SHARKEY
Credits are in German “Faust” is
“Faust” in German right

CLAIRE
Last I checked

SHARKEY
“Hat Gerecht Filmen Sie Studios”

CLAIRE
That’s not right Murnau’s studio was
Universum Film AG

SHARKEY

Okay the title “Judas Jedermann”
CLAIRE

What
SHARKEY

This is some other film
Jon and Claire are instantly at Sharkey’s elbows

SHARKEY (CONTD) (cont’d)
“Hergestellt durch Die Oculus Gruppe”

CLAIRE
That’s the producers
(reads )
“Geleitet durch Max Kassel”

SHARKEY
That’s the director
CLAIRE
Oh my God I don’t believe it
JON
Who is he
CLAIRE

This is a lost film

SHARKEY
Is this the same as the “Max Castle”
spelled like “Castle”

JON

You mean William Castle
CLAIRE

No no -- Max
SHARKEY

There’s a legend he made a film in
Hollywood It’s lost too “Queen of
Venus”

JON
Two lost films

Claire takes another look through the magnifying glass

CLAIRE
(correctly )
“(Yoo-dus Yay-der-mahn)” “Judas
Everyman”

JON
What do you know about it

CLAIRE
Made before World War II Supposed to be
a masterpiece but no one I’ve ever met
has seen it

SHARKEY
Well let’s throw it up

Sharkey and Jon load the film onto the projector and thread
it Sharkey turns on a series of switches

GORDON

AMY
(to Claire)

Have you seen anything at the ShowArt

CLAIRE
Uh No It’s not my thing

word “mondo” to legitimize it

SHARKEY
Ah Yes A true connoisseur of art
films “The Leopard” Boring

pretention

CLAIRE
I’m more flexible than that

SHARKEY
It’s cool -- I need your type to hate
what I show -- it gives me street cred as

an underground scenester Right Jon

You can find art anywhere if you apply

enough intellectual masturbation Right

INT LOBBY

Jon and Claire emerge from one side Sharkey and Amy from the
other

JON
Mind-blowing The whole film is a series
of powerful symbols that tell a story

CLAIRE
It’s ground-breaking The images were
iconical rather than indexical

JON
What is that supposed to mean

CLAIRE
I clarified what you were groping for

AMY
It was a disgusting piece of shit

SHARKEY
Like you know fuck-all about film
Fucking thing was brilliant

CLAIRE
Castle did something I’ve never seen
before He executed a radical sort of
hermeneutic reconfiguration of story and
image

JON
What kind of bullshit “word salad” are
you trying to toss

CLAIRE
You can’t grasp what I said you stupid
shit

SHARKEY

(grabbing his crotch)
Grasp this bitch

Jon uses CELLOPHANE TAPE to stick the two sides of the
diagram together

CLAIRE

I had nightmares about that damned film
JON

I did too
CLAIRE

It was so brilliant at getting deep into
your subconscious

JON
The way Castle shot that epilogue with
all the people killing themselves -- It

was so visceral
Pause They both silently wash over with grimness

CLAIRE
How’s Sharkey

JON
I don’t know I think he’s still asleep

A silence They seem to feel each other’s mood

It’s fifteen days early

A long beat as Jon doesn’t know what to say

Jon is at the top of the steps that lead to an APARTMENT He
knocks on the door

We’ve met before -- at an Ophuls

(offers her hand)
I remember Nice to see you again

INT GORDON’S OFFICE

Gordon ashen-faced sits at his desk Jon and Claire sit in
chairs

GORDON
She just ran right out and got hit
JON
Killed instantly
GORDON
That’s terrible I’m sorry How’s
Sharkey
JON

He’s not up yet
A beat as

Jon leans

GORDON
He doesn’t have any plans to show this
film does he

JON
I don’t know -- but he’1ll probably want
to Why

GORDON

It could cause some problems
JON

Problems
GORDON

Who owns it
Jon and Claire look at each other

JON
Chipsey Goldstone But he doesn’t know
we have it In fact he doesn’t know he
owns it The cannisters are marked
Murnau’s “Faust” I saw the film was in
bad shape so I took it

forward to enthusiastically press this point

JON (contd)
Gordon wait till you see it “Judas
Jedermann” is way ahead of its time It
has a gritty cinéma vérité texture with
hand held camera work like a
hyperrealistic pseudo-documentary

CLAIRE
(topping Jon’s enthusiasm)
-- But it’s also formalistic in a way
It’s as if Rembrandt had treated his
paintings with a glaze that covered more
than it revealed

Gordon looks at each of them in turn considering this

GORDON
Well I did some digging last night
Tried to find what I could in my library
Got some tidbits from different books

Gordon slides over open BOOKS and refers to them WE
INTERCUT WITH PHOTOS from German films and film sets

GORDON (CONTD) (contd)
Max Kassel Born in 1915 in Berlin He
grew up working on the sets of Murnau
Pabst Lang First just a little boy
running errands By the age of fourteen
he was drawing designs that were used in
some films He started experimenting
with lenses and lights at the age of
sixteen Age 23 he directs “Judas
Jedermann” No one knows what happened
to the film It became the stuff of
legend Collectors have hounded it
since As for Max he hides out during
World War II He comes to Los Angeles in
1945 Nothing really known about him
until 1952 when he directs B-movie
“Queen of Venus” -- produced by Ira
Goldstone

JON
Oh -- so that’s why Ira had “Judas” in
his collection

GORDON

(continuing)
“Queen of Venus” is never released Some
say it wasn’t finished that Max was
fired Or it’s because Ira had a heart
attack Max Castle leaves Los Angeles
He crosses the iron curtain to East
Berlin The Communists detain him then
quickly deport him The plane he’s on
vanishes He’s never found

JON
Vanishes

INT OPEN WORKSPACE AREA

A BACK DOOR is propped open Jon and Gordon carry the

What’s this

JON

Gordon goes to cannister 1 and takes hold of the SHORT BLACK
STRIP of FILM It’s stuck to the cannister He gently works
it until it COMES LOOSE Gordon holds it up to the light
studies it closely

GORDON
Solid black

Gordon tosses it towards a trash can It misses landing on

spiral shot How did he do it

CLAIRE
He was doing things that didn’t show up

ROCKET through the air -- with SHRILL WHISTLES -- and SLAM

INTO THE WALLS SMASH WINDOWS SMASH LIGHTING FIXTURES The
NOISE is DEAFENING -- and deeply UNNERVING

Jon has to duck and flinch as if entering a crossfire --
while also coughing and wiping his eyes

In the FLASHES of explosions in the SMOKE the VAGUE
appearance of DEMONIC ANGRY FACES can POSSIBLY be seen

his way to the door almost getting killed by flying
cannisters A RAPID MOVEMENT of SOMETHING -- a SHADOW

smoke and looks down

It’s Gordon DEAD His face neck and chest are SOAKED with
BLOOD His LEGS are AFLAME

Jon FLINCHES with HORRIFIC SHOCK His feet SLOSH in the
massive LAKE of blood on the floor

useful knowledge about who mightve
killed Gordon or he gets the fuck out

CLAIRE
You spiked our drinks

ZIPSKY
No Watching the film made this happen
to you See the stuff Max did is not
like anything that’s ever been done or is
being done Everything he did had to
work with the “flicker”

JON
Flicker

ZIPSKY
The back-and-forth between light and
dark It hypnotizes you Then with
Max’s underhold he gets into your
subconscious

CLAIRE
Underhold

ZIPSKY
It’s what you don’t see But you see it
anyway Even though you don’t

JON
Subliminal images

ZIPSKY
You want to call it something fancy
good “”

(MORE )
Zipsky’s face shows an immediate sense of having “said too
He wheels to the door and opens it

much”

ZIPSKY (contd)
Judas Jedermann” causes some kind of
mean shit doesn’t it And “Queen of
Venus” creates some kinda sex reaction

CLAIRE
You spiked our drinks

ZIPSKY
Max was so far beyond everything He
would even shit me about how he wanted to
make a film with no DP ‘Cause thered
be no light Watching it would be like
you were blind

CLAIRE
He must have been joking with you

ZIPSKY
Max was a genius No one has any idea

JON
Is there anyone who would kill to steal a
Max Castle film

ZIPSKY
Those freak bastards in the cult -- the
cult Max was in He broke it off with
them but they never accepted his
resignation if you get my gist

I’m getting tired

Jon takes out his wallet removes the DIAGRAM on the PACKING

Claire pours two espressos from an elaborate SAMOVAR

CLAIRE

You bumped into someone
JON

CLAIRE

And you didn’t see who it was

JON
No

Claire sets down a cup of espresso in front of Jon and then
starts massaging his shoulders

JON (contd)
You can be sweet It’s not like you

CLAIRE
I know

She sits at the table with him sips from her own cup Jon’s
eyes idly scan the table He sees a LETTER on her desk with
the LOGO of the magazine “THE NEW YORKER” He picks it up
Claire quickly snatches it away

JON
Are you going to get a job with “The New
Yorker”

CLAIRE

In my wettest of dreams It’s a
rejection letter

JON
They should hire you

The look of affection between them momentarily embarrasses
both of them To break it Claire picks up an LA WEEKLY
and waves it at Jon

CLAIRE
I’ve been at this rag for ten years My
car is falling apart I barely make rent -
- and “I’m wearing a cardboard belt”

JON
You would have gotten the job -- if they
could hear you write a review

Claire gives him a wry smile as she sips PHONE RINGS
Claire lets the machine get it
SHARKEY’S VOICE
(from answering machine)
Hey it’s Sharkey You guys there
Someone broke into the theatre again last
night

EXT SHOWART THEATRE - MORNING

Jon walks up and sees HUGE CHAINS on the door He knocks
Sharkey unlocks a MASSIVE PADLOCK

INT LOBBY

Sharkey lets Jon inside

JON

SHARKEY

No
JON

But they didn’t get the film right

SHARKEY
They didn’t get shit Let ‘em try

Sharkey shows Jon a HANDGUN

JON
Shit Where’d you get that

SHARKEY

Jon stares at him a beat with concern Kirk enters carrying

a large cloth bag

JON
Hey Kirk
KIRK

Jon
JON

Listen uh keep an eye on Sharkey
will you

SHARKEY
Funny Jon

KIRK
(to Jon)
Don’t worry I’m oon it

JON
Thanks

Kirk sets the bag down by Sharkey Sharkey unzips it and
lifts out a RIFLE Jon reacts with irritated surprise He
looks into the bag -- glimpses of BOXES of BULLETS HUNTING
KNIVES CAMOUFLAGED CLOTHES Jon lets out a somber SIGH

EXT UCLA GRADUATE HOUSING AREA - DAY
Jon walks to one of the residential buildings
EXT UPPER LANDING - RESIDENTIAL BUILDING

Jon goes to a unit door knocks After a beat he knocks
again Then he tries the handle It is unlocked Jon
opens the door

JON
Hello It’s Jon Gates You translated
the film for me

Jon takes a tentative step inside He reacts visibly to a
foul odor Then the door opens wider

JON (contd)
Hello

Jon steps into --
INT SUSAN’S APT

Jon sees the place is a complete MESS -- and glimpses some
BLOODY RAGS in the bathroom A long beat

Abruptly from Jon’s side before he can see her the German
Grad Student SUSAN SCRATCHES Jon’s face Her eyes are WILD
with rage Her hair is matted and tangled She’s in a robe
She picks up and HURLS a THICK NOTEBOOK at him which slams
him in the gut

SUSAN
Get your sick shit out of here you evil
fuck

Jon spots the “Judas” VIDEO on the floor and quickly snatches
it He backs out of the doorway Susan SLAMS it shut

INT CLAIRE’S APT - AFTERNOON

Claire reads the notebook as Jon paces rubbing a salve into
the scratches on his face

CLAIRE
It’s basically just the story of Christ
from Judas’ point of view Pretty bland
dialogue

JON
You should have seen her She looked
deranged She attacked me

CLAIRE
Just from doing this translation I
don’t see how it could be that
disturbing

JON
The film did it to her Not the
dialogue not the story

CLAIRE
The imagery It was graphic at times
but nothing a grown-up can’t handle

JON
No -- something else about the film

CLAIRE
What is that supposed to mean Jon

JON
I think you and I know first hand how Max
Castle’s films can affect the viewer

CLAIRE
Zipsky slipped us a drug -- or a mix of
drugs

JON
Maybe the film was the “drug”

CLAIRE
So you think just watching “Queen of
Venus” made us feel this way about

each other

JON
I don’t know I’ve had movies make me
feel like I’m falling in love but not
actually cause it

CLAIRE
So which is it Are we really falling
in love -- or are we brainwashed

JON

We’re really falling in love

She smiles at him They put their arms around each other
kiss for a lingering moment Then they look into each
other’s eyes

JON (CONTD) (contd)
But maybe the film gave us a jumpstart

Claire’s expression turns seriously sour She lights a
cigarette picks up the notebook and jams it into Jon’s
stomach

CLAIRE
I have work to do

Jon takes the notebook giving her an irritated expression
He LEAVES

INT JON’S APT - DUSK

Jon lies on his floor watching his VIDEO copy of “Judas
Jedermann” with the notebook open in front of him ON TV
SCREEN -- JUDAS walks up to a wooden door He opens it and
goes into a room in which CHRIST and the other DISCIPLES eat
the LAST SUPPER

-- LOUD OBNOXIOUSLY-BAD SAXOPHONE PRACTICE -- from another
TENANT’S APT Jon grits his teeth and STABS an INK PEN into
the notebook He rises goes to a window and SLAMS it shut
so hard the GLASS sprouts a slight CRACK

JON
Fucking asshole

The SAXOPHONE STOPS Jon returns to his position on the
floor He roughly snatches up the remote and VISUAL REWINDS
the video He hits PLAY and WE SEE -- ON TV SCREEN -- Judas
walking down a stone corridor toward a wooden door

Jon takes a deep breath and seems to relax He flips ahead
in the notebook then flips back He keeps watching

ON TV SCREEN -- Judas opens the door and enters the room of
the Last Supper Jon’s face FLUSHES RED

JON (contd)
If that piece of shit starts playing that
motherfucking sax again I’ll rip his --

Jon suddenly grabs the remote and hits STOP The TV screen
goes BLUE Jon rubs his face He turns to look toward the
window There still has been NO SOUND of the saxophone

He turns his head back to look at the TV screen
SMASH CUT TO
INT SHOWART BASEMENT - NIGHT

Sharkey watches as Jon moves the film of “Judas” slowly by
hand as he looks at each frame through a powerful OPTICAL
VIEWER

SHARKEY
Every time you got to this point in the
film you freaked

JON
Out of my mind with rage

SHARKEY
Fantastic man This is great shit

JON
WHOA

Jon FLINCHES back from whatever he saw Then he timidly
puts his eye back on the optical viewer

JON’S POV - THROUGH MAGNIFYING GLASS

FRAME -- MID SHOT -- Judas opening the wooden door In the
BLACK SHADOW cast on the door from Judas’ body is the
HIDEOUS FACE of a HALF-HUMAN HALF-ANIMAL DEMON wearing a
METAL CROWN with an UPSIDE DOWN-CRUCIFIX Sweat covers the
face and the eyes glisten with wet fury It is so vivid so
alive that it almost seems as if the image is not a frame
but a MOTION PICTURE of an unmoving demon

MOVE TO NEXT FRAME -- and the demon is still there also NEXT
frame and NEXT frame

ON JON and ON SHARKEY
As Jon raises up from the magnifying glass
JON

I just found one of Max Castle’s
subliminal images

Sharkey looks through the glass

SHARKEY
SHIT SHIT
(raises up)
Did he use an optical printer

JON
When this was made I don’t see how
They didn’t have optical printers that
could do this

SHARKEY
Well then how

Sharkey moves the film more quickly under the viewer

SHARKEY (contd)
Twelve frames -- a half a second Wait
After another half second the face is
there again -- for another half second
And same thing again same thing
again Total of six times

Jon takes over with the viewer and continues the process of
moving through the film

CLOSE ON - SCRIPT PAGE

SKETCHING with a pencil a DEMON’S FACE Then Jon draws
LINES from the sketch to indicate the SECTION of the script
where this subliminal image appears in the film PHONE

A very nervous YOUNG MAN FRIEDRICH who’s VOICE weve heard
leans against a window sill his face looking outside
FRIEDRICH
Jon Listen There were some men in
here this morning They wanted to know
if we had any Max Castle films

JON
Who were they

FRIEDRICH
I don’t know But one was bald around
60 and a cataract in one eye He was
almost “too” pleasant

JON
They didn’t leave their names

FRIEDRICH
No But it is weird is it not No one
has ever asked about Castle in the four
years I have worked here

JON
Did they say they were with any
organization

FRIEDRICH
No But this is the big part -- they
were interested in Castle’s experimental
films

JON
What experimental films

FRIEDRICH
Exactly I told them there are no such
films -- But do they know something we
don’t

JON

Friedrich can you try to find those men
again Find out who they are

FRIEDRICH
I have no time for such things Jon

JON
They could be involved in Gordon’s
murder

FRIEDRICH
I told you to leave town -- and there you
are still Did you burn “Judas
Jedermann”

JON
Uh well first I --

FRIEDRICH
Do it And come over here You’1l be
just in time for the festival

As Claire drives scowling in distracted suspicion Jon pores
over the obit

That’s why they called it an “accident”
and labeled it “freak”

stare at the house Curtains drawn no lights on

EXT BACK OF ZIPSKY’S HOUSE

stare at the sight for a beat then Jon steps across the mess
and into --

open all over the place Claire enters as Jon looks over the
labels on the canisters

JON

SOUND of KEY in LOCK DOOR OPENING Jon and Claire ina
panic move as quietly and rapidly as they can through an
open door to --

WALK-IN STORAGE CLOSET

Where they wait and listen

OLD WOMAN’S VOICE
Oh my God

Sound of FOOTFALL through the living room mess Then closer
-- from the screening room Jon peeks around the side of the
closet doorway

JON’S POV - SCREENING ROOM

The OLD WOMAN -- the one who Zipsky lied about knowing -- who
helped him into his car at the ShowArt -- looks around with
an expression of both fear and grief Beyond her on the
WALL is a PUBLICITY PHOTO of the young OLGA TELL It’s
immediately CLEAR that this woman is one and the same

STORAGE CLOSET

Jon pulls back and turns to Claire speechless getting hit
with a revelation SOUND of the woman WALKING through the
living room again

JON
(quiet whisper)
I just realized who that woman is It’s
Olga Tell

EXT ZIPSKY’S HOUSE - FRONT

The Old Woman leaves locking the door She hobbles away
from the house to her CAR

her car into the drive beside an old TWO-STORY 1930’s SPANISH

front door Jon rings the bell

MARIA’S VOICE
(from inside)
Who is it

JON
We’re friends of Arnold Zipsky Can we
talk to you for a minute

MARIAS VOICE
LEAVE ME ALONE GO AWAY

JON
Uh I didn’t mean to make you angry But
--- My friend was killed -- and you know

Zipsky was you know killed

Jon stymied and growing angry looks at Claire then turns
back toward the door Jon’s voice clearly can be HEARD up
and down the street

JON
WE KNOW YOU’RE OLGA TELL YOU’RE OLGA

The door opens Maria angrily waves them inside
INT FOYER

Maria slams the door shut then stands between them and the
rest of her house

MARIA
You get this straight I was a friend of
Olga Tell I was at her funeral And
tonight I was at the wake of another
friend How dare you attack a poor old
grief-stricken woman when --

JON
Did you know Max Castle

MARIA

That’s none of your business
CLAIRE

So -- you did know him
JON

I have a print of “Judas Jedermann”
Maria seems to become more and more frightened

MARIA
Then you are a fool

CLAIRE
Why Are we in danger

JON
And from whom Zipsky told us about the
cult

CLAIRE

He confided in us You can too

MARIA
I know nothing about it

JON
We even have a print of one of Max’s
experimental films

Claire is surprised to hear Jon lie but stays silent -- as
she watches Maria get pale

MARIA
There is only one

Maria reacts surprised by her mistake of admitting this

JON
Then it must be the one I have

MARIA
And have you watched it
JON
Yes
MARIA
Liar
JON

Why am I a liar

MARIA
Now I know you’re a liar

JON
Tell me why I’m a liar

MARIA
Because if you watched it you’d be dead

JON
You mean someone would kill me Or that
the film would kill me

MARIA
You both have only lied to me and tried
to trick me Now GO

INT CLAIRES PEUGOT - MOVING - LATER

Claire drives slowly trying to absorb what just happened

JON
A film that can kill you when you
watch it

CLAIRE
I’ve seen some that have come close to
killing me

JON
Seriously -- it’s possible -- given what

we know Max could do with subliminals
And those men who are looking for it --
they must have a good reason right

CLAIRE
Maybe you’1l find out I’m going to
Berlin Want to come with me

give them this scrap of film tell

them it is whatever they look for

JON
Let me help you out of there

the taxicab ahead of them

EXT CONVERTED HOUSE - LATER - DAY

A 60’s “modern” Berlin residence now a place of business
with a SIGN above the door Dr Byx goes through the door

A beat later Jon walks up to the doorstep

CLOSE ON - DOORSTEP AREA

From here Jon can read the sign “WAISEN VOM STURM” He
yanks out his GermanEnglish dictionary
JON
“Sturm” is “storm” so this has to be
(finds it)

“Waisen” -- “orphans”

Jon looks at the door hesitating After a beat he goes

inside

INT LOBBY AREA

“Modern” 60’s era furnishings Jon looks around A door

opens and a PLEASANT YOUNG WOMAN in a light BLUE DRESS

emerges from a modern-looking bright OFFICE

BLUE DRESS
Guten tag

JON
Uh sprecken zee uh English

Jon is flipping through his GermanEnglish dictionary
Dress frowns

BLUE DRESS
Englisch Nein Wer sind sie

JON
Do you have anything I can read about
Waisens Vom Sturm “Buchs”

Blue Dress goes back into the office

BLUE DRESS (0S)
Doktor Byx

Dr Byx emerges from the office with Blue Dress behind him

He looks at Jon probably recognizing him He smiles
solicitously

DR BYX
May I help you son

JON
Uh hello “Dr Byx” I’m Jon Gates
I’m doing research on the filmmaker Max
Castle who was a member of your your
« group

DR BYX
He was When

JON
You don’t know the name “Max Castle”

DR BYX
Should I

JON
Maybe you could just explain what the
Orphans of the Storm is about or uh

what they you do

DR BYX
You may go and sit in our meditation
room if you like

Jon isn’t sure whether to say yes or no to this Byx
pleasantly opens a door to an AUDITORIUM Jon gives a slight
smile and a nod He walks through to doorway Byx lets the
door swing shut

INT AUDITORIUM

Jon walks right into the spotlight so to speak The
AUDIENCE is FACING HIM Some of them glance at him but most
have their eyes locked on something ABOVE and BEHIND him
from which LIGHT comes

Jon steps forward and to the side turning to see the SCREEN
which plays a blown-up VIDEO of BYX’S FACE talking directly
to camera He speaks in GERMAN with a big smile and eyes
that are opened a bit too wide -- an expression of something
closer to mania than enthusiasm

The only AISLE through the seats is CENTER so Jon has to
lope up past the faces of the viewers Only the front third
of the seats are filled with gaps There’s a group of GRADE
SCHOOL KIDS all in school UNIFORMS watching with good
behavior -- paying attention not moving Scattered around
are HOMELESS-LOOKING PEOPLE -- some very FILTHY

The rest are MEN and WOMEN between age 20 and age 50 who are
each uniquely yet subtly STRANGE One man is DROOLING
slightly one woman an UNEVEN HAIRCUT one man is dressed in
1900’s CLOTHES one woman EATS something that looks FURRY
one man has an OXYGEN TANK and a BREATHING MASK that covers
the WHOLE FACE

Jon moves past several rows behind any seated people to
isolate himself He moves into a row and takes the fourth
seat from the aisle As he watches Byx on SCREEN he pulls
out his notebook He begins to jot down a few words here and
there spelling them by guesswork

Then -- silence from the video Jon steps to a position to
see the screen Byx’s face still fills the frame having the
same expression but he DOESN’T SPEAK He simply continues
to stare into camera as if he were staring at the audience
The audience accepts this as normal People begin to smile
up at Byx

INT LOBBY - ORPHANS HQ - LATER

Jon emerges from the auditorium He goes to the door of the
office It’s closed and locked He scans the lobby picking
up reading material There’s nothing about the Orphans

EXT OFFICE BUILDING - 60’S ERA “MODERN”

Jon approaches the entrance which has a FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
SEAL above the door

INT RECEPTION AREA
Jon speaks with a GOATEED CLERK

JON
»- Old records about religious cults
From about 1920 to 1930

INT BASEMENT STORAGE ROOM

Metal shelving units with old boxes containing extremely old
documents Several boxes are on the floor Jon and Goateed
Clerk are kneeling by them Goateed Clerk studies the
documents inside a dusty folder that has a SWASTIKA

JON
Aren’t we looking for something before
the Nazi’s were in power

GOATEED CLERK
The Nazis subsumed old records into their
own And they were very interested in
spiritual cults Here See Quite a
list

JON
Oh yeah Now were talking

GOATEED CLERK
And you see that seal It refers to the
older Weimar records which are at the
back of the folder

JON
Jesus how many religious cults could
there be

GOATEED CLERK
What was the name of the one you’re
looking for

JON
“Orphans of the -- ”

GOATEED CLERK
(interrupting flipping pages)
“Waisen Vom Sturm” Here And it
indexes more documents

The Goateed Clerk digs through the box pulls up another
folder spreads it open on the floor digs through it

GOATEED CLERK (contd)
Here Dated 1923 A list of all the
known members

The Clerk hands the list to Jon Jon’s eyes whip down the
names

JON
Oh my God
INT BERLIN HOTEL ROOM - LATER - DAY
Jon is rapidly packing his suitcase Claire paces smoking

deeply irritated looking at a PHOTOCOPY of the 1923 MEMBERS
LIST of “Orphans”

CLAIRE
“Maximilian Kassel”

JON
And did you see “Robert Weine” That’s
two film directors in the cult

CLAIRE
(looks down list)
Weine Hm Are you suggesting that “The
Cabinet of Dr Caligari” is supposed to
make the viewer sleepwalk and kill
people

JON
Wait a minute -- that’s the film Gordon
was watching when they killed him Maybe
he found out a connection between

Caligari and Judas Jedermann -- When he
talked to somebody at Bundes Archiv that
night

CLAIRE

Will you stop saying somebody killed him
We don’t know that And you can’t go
I’m still here for two days

JON
My schedule has changed

CLAIRE
You have to go find the “truth” about the
big evil conspiracy in film history

JON
If you don’t believe it fine Why do
you have to be a fucking bitch about it

CLAIRE
Because you’re being a complete idiot
Subliminal images have been proven to be
ineffective by scientists -- over and
over and over again
(quieter )

And because I don’t like the thought that
I’ve spent my life watching and studying
and writing about films for no reason
Jon And I don’t want to think that how
I feel about you is just brainwashing

Claire’s vulnerable expression reveals her affection Jon
goes to her tries to kiss her She pulls back and blows
smoke in his face -- her emotional guard up again

JON
I’1ll see you back in LA

Don’t count on it

INT SHOWART THEATRE - HOUSE

The SCREEN shows SCRATCHED CLEAR FILM for a beat then it is
BLACK and WHITE FOOTAGE -- from “JUDAS JEDERMANN” -- but with
no synced sound JUDAS walks to a door throwing a shadow
over it He turns the knob The JUDAS ACTOR STOPS abruptly
DROPPING CHARACTER turning to look at someone BEHIND the
CAMERA

JON (0S)
Holy shit This is an outtake

Suddenly SOMETHING HAPPENS with the LENS -- and a MIRROR
gets MOVED to the side The camera PANS to the LEFT --

-- CENTERING ON -- a SEATED ACTOR is IN VIEW His face
sweats He wears a METAL CROWN with an UPSIDE-DOWN CRUCIFIX

A GROUP of MEN in ROBES with OCCULT SYMBOLS walk INTO FRAME
gathering around the Seated Actor One of them unrolls a
SCROLL and somberly READS from it In intervals the other
men seem to REPEAT a phrase

The Seated Actor appears to GO INTO A TRANCE His head
lowers at first then it RAISES -- and his expression is one
of SHEER EVIL

Again something happens to the LENS a FLASH of a MIRROR
being swung into place -- and the camera begins to PAN back
to its original position when -- The film RUNS OUT

Same frame as seen earlier -- JUDAS is reaching for the
doorknob casting a shadow over the door Inside the shadow
is the DEMON’S HEAD -- with the same CROWN on his head

ON BASEMENT

Jon pulls back straightens stares at Sharkey Sharkey
eagerly guides Jon out of the way and takes a look for
himself Then he raises up and stares at Jon

SHARKEY
The guy in the chair was the demon
Shit Jon the subliminals in the film
were

JON
-- Were created on set during shooting
No optical printer Did you notice the
ritual they were doing over him What
happened to him He seemed to be like a
medium at a seance being taken over by a
demon personality

SHARKEY
Yeah It was creepy But why didn’t
the guy have the make-up on They were
about to roll film on the scene again

JON
What if there was no make-up
SHARKEY
What do you mean You mean the actor

channelled a demon and the film could
record what the demon looked like

JON
Maybe I’m taking this mystical aspect too
far

Sharkey pulls a PINT WHISKEY BOTTLE out of his jacket and
GUZZLES all of it in one gulp Then he lights a JOINT As
he takes a long toke his hand holding the lighter shifts the
lighter down and shifts a small POUCH to the top He shakes
COCAINE out of the pouch onto his forearm and SNORTS it

JON
I got to tell you about all the stuff I
found out about the Orphans

INT SHARKEY’S APT - ABOVE THEATRE - LATER - NIGHT

Jon and Sharkey sit on the sofa with all Jon’s RESEARCH
spread out over the coffee table He READS ALOUD as he goes

JON
“Robert W Paul in London was
projecting motion pictures onto a screen
in 1895” -- That’s the same time as the
Lumiere brothers “He created a
projector that holds each frame for a
beat that’s longer than the blackness
between frames Thus he was the first
to reduce the ‘flicker’ so that it was
less noticeable by the viewer” --
Meaning the viewer’s conscious mind

SHARKEY
What’s his connection

JON
He was a Spiritualist and an associate of
Robert Weine Which means he was in this
same death cult -- but in a branch in
England
SHARKEY
Weine The guy who did “Caligari” This
is freaky shit man

At the window to the OUTSIDE DOOR KIRK’S FACE moves into
view He stares through the glass at them able to
eavesdrop

JON

(reading)
“Emil Mechau in Germany is considered
the inventor of the first motion picture
projector as we know it today He
projected silent movies without any
‘flicker’ visible to the eye” So he
finished what Robert Paul started -- and
made the ‘flicker’ completely invisible

SHARKEY
And he was in this
JON
Yes -- the same cult as Weine and Max

Castle And here look at my diagram
I’ve connected names of people who
associated with each other In Germany
Max Castle worked with Abel Karsky on
changes in the motion picture camera
Then Abel Karsky and John Belson a
Brit made improvements to the projector
Now John Belson worked with Eric
Harriman an American on changes to the
camera And just follow these
connections all the way to

SHARKEY
All these guys -- in television too
Shit Jon these last few names are
within the last ten years

JON
And the most recent names
(flips through pages)
are in a cult identified as being the
“Orphans of the Storm”

SHARKEY
My God
JON
I have no other explanation than -- some

Spiritualists formed their own cult right
before motion pictures were invented
(MORE )

JON (contd)
The cult grabbed onto the invention and
formed it shaped it to do what they want
it to do

SHARKEY
Which is what

JON
I don’t know

Jon and Sharkey stare at each other They don’t see Kirk’s
face in the window -- somber -- then pulling OUT OF VIEW

INT JON’S APT - DAY

Jon is almost BURIED under PAPERS and OPEN BOOKS on the
living room floor His eyes are bloodshot He reads

Now the content of his copied articles are about VIOLENCE at
FILM THEATRES (regardless of which film) -- fist fights
brawls riots and shootings -- articles from the past up to
the present

KNOCK Jon gets up opens the door It’s Claire She
smiles at him steps inside presses herself against him and
kisses him

CLAIRE
I missed you

JON
I thought you were mad at me

She looks at the mess then looks at Jon’s face his eyes
She runs her hand through his hair

CLAIRE
Looks like I got here just in time

Jon holds up articles about riots at theatres

JON
Want to see what the Orphans have been up
to since they lost Max Castle -- For

the last 60 years they’ve been trying to
replicate what he was able to do

They’ve been experimenting on specific
prints of major studio releases in one
city or another Look -- fights riots
murders -- always assumed to be random
violence

Claire has a non-expression She looks at the articles then
looks at other papers going through everything Jon paces
watching her Finally Claire looks up at him dubious She
lifts up a COLORFUL PRINT of a GOOFY WEB PAGE --

CLAIRE

How scholarly “Serioso’s Conspiracy
Club”

(reads )
“The ‘Orphans of the Storm’ is a cult
started by Spiritualists in the late
1800’s In addition to the basic
spiritualistic belief that human spirits
live after death on an alternate plane of
reality the Orphans believe that spirits
inside still-living humans are trapped
Spirits must get free of their earthly
bodies and cross over to the other side
By coincidence or with purpose they had
prominent members who were early pioneers
in the technology of motion pictures
Rumors persist that the cult continues to
thrive all over the earth” More like
“all over the internet”

Claire goes to him rubs his shoulders She grins at him
patronizingly

CLAIRE (CONTD) (cont’d)
Jon I know you’ve been through a lot

Jon pulls away from her touch

JON
Don’t act like I’m a mental patient

CLAIRE
Why should I You’re doing a good enough
job by yourself

She runs her fingers through his hair Jon SLAPS her hand
away

JON
I didn’t get into this relationship just
to have you be a condescending bitch all
the time

taking off his clothes

The “Orphans of the Storm” headquarters
in Berlin

JON
Very funny Did you go into the
meditation room

CLAIRE
I saw it Weird I agree Anyway
they’d heard of me from my critical

reputation I asked someone about their

involvement with film

JON
Dr Byx He talked about it

CLAIRE
No a pleasant young woman

Claire reaches into her
grabs the brochure from
to the last page It’s
headquarters in BERLIN

purse and pulls out a BROCHURE Jon
Claire flips through it He comes
a PHOTO showing the “ORPHANS”

CLAIRE (contd)
The “Orphans of the Storm” is a film
preservation society Something you

should know about They’ve been in
existence since the silent era They

find and save “orphaned” films -- films
without a current owner to take care of --
JON
I know what it means But what about
the Spiritualism

CLAIRE
Some of their members have been
Spiritualists -- as well as many other

belief systems and religions It doesn’t
interfere with their work

Claire starts putting on the rest of her clothes lights a

cigarette heads for the door

the fire There is no physical evidence
of an intruder -- or any struggle

JON
It’s not possible

Did you know that Dr Gordon had been
regularly “borrowing” money from the Film

Kirk with traces of COCAINE around his nostrils is wired
and manic

KIRK
That actor who was sitting down -- he
channeled a demon -- and the film somehow

could record the actual demon’s face --
the subliminal image

CLAIRE
You’re joking right

KIRK
Sharkey I’m right right

Sharkey looks at him with apologetic resignation

SHARKEY
It’s fun to think so Kirk But no
They must have used an optical printer to
put it on the film

Kirk looks as if his mentor has betrayed him He stomps out

stabbing himself in the throat

Now wait a minute Jon I want to look
for it but I don’t want you to start up
again with --

JON
Rosensweig failed in his suicide attempt
but the other men succeeded Of course
the Orphans would want Max to make a film
to cause that effect Because they want
people to free themselves from the

COUNTDOWN LEADER comes off the reel Then BLACK LEADER --
only a short strip then COUNTDOWN LEADER again continuing
until the OPENING FRAMES of the “CALIGARI” start to pass
through his hands

Didn’t Zipsky say something about Max
wanting to make a film with all black
frames Like you’re blind when you watch
it

Yeah I think so

Jon shows her the black strip of “leader” Then he takes a
cutting tool and removes all of the leader section from the
front of the “Caligari”

He goes to a VIEWING TABLE with a light underneath He grabs
a rag to wipe off the black soot He turns on the light He
sets down the film with the black frames on the glass

He takes an optical viewer and peers down at a black frame

corner partially obscured He puts his arm up against the
wall then lets his forehead rest against it -- as if
preparing himself Claire watches

CLOSE ON JON

As he simply hits “SEND” The cell phone’s LED displays a
NUMBER with a area code Rings

BYX’S VOICE
Yes Claire Hello Claire There is
interference I cannot hear you

Jon DISCONNECTS looks at the phone paranoid

INT SHARKEY’S APT - ABOVE THEATRE - LATER - PRE-DAWN

Jon Claire and Sharkey are all drinking all have pale faces
with eyes that show stunned devastation Jon is cold to
Claire
SHARKEY
The cops sounded pretty positive it was
suicide

JON

Of course it was Just like Gordon
Just like the men in the theatre with
Rosensweig That film causes suicide
Max Castle made it before he broke away
from the “Orphans”

SHARKEY
Why suicide
JON
It’s part of their plan -- for people to

leave the trap of their physical bodies

SHARKEY
Shit man

CLAIRE
Sharkey Kirk was doing tons of drugs
Wasn’t he

SHARKEY
So what
CLAIRE
I watched him in the basement -- coming

down hard from a cocaine high

JON
Why didn’t you do anything

CLAIRE
I didn’t know he was going to kill
himself

JON

You saw him watch the film

CLAIRE
I was on the staircase

Claire livid shoots to her feet and stomps to the door

SHARKEY
Hey guys come on we’re all shocked
and upset and tired and drunk

Claire EXITS slamming the door Jon shoots to his feet

INT JONS HONDA - MOVING - MOMENTS LATER

Jon looks through is REAR-VIEW MIRROR watches Claire pull
out then does a U-TURN and FOLLOWS CLAIRE

INT JONS HONDA - MOVING - LATER
Jon follows Claire’s Peugot which is a block ahead Jon
sighs realizing where she’s going THE WEEKLY Claire pulls

up an alley beside the Weekly’s building Jon pulls over and
idles He rubs his face

INT JON’S APT - LATER

Jon enters and immediately sees Colby Mathers sitting on the
sofa

JON
WHAT THE FUCK

Jon picks up a chair wielding it as a weapon

JON (contd)
YOU BROKE IN HERE

MATHERS
No

JON
LIAR

Jon takes a swing with the chair Mathers dodges it
-- Sharkey emerges from the bathroom smoking a joint

SHARKEY
Dude chill I have a key remember

Jon turns to Sharkey staring at him trying to figure out
what’s going on

SHARKEY (contd)
Mathers has been working against the
Orphans

JON
You expect me to believe --

Sharkey hands Jon a BOOK “LAYERS OF FILM By COLBY
MATHERS Jon takes it He opens it Random House Photo
of (a younger) MATHERS
SHARKEY
It’s all about film as a manipulator of
the masses Look at Chapter 20

Jon flips through the pages stops

JON
(reading)
“Exposing the ‘Orphans of the Storm’”

MATHERS
Skip two pages and read about the arrest

JON

(flips pages reads)
“ I set a trap to catch the two art
thieves in the act of stealing rare
films The prosecutor had enough
evidence to convict Hugo Bastinere and
Wolf Byx”

(to Mathers)

Byx

MATHERS
Dr Byx’s brother -- very high up in the
cult’s power structure I helped put him
in prison Now you see -- there is no
way that I’m in the cult They hate me

Jon drops into his desk chair looking through the book

MATHERS (cont’d)
Unfortunately I couldn’t give the FBI
enough evidence to link those men to the
Orphans cult

SHARKEY
Colby wants to destroy the print of
“Judas Jedermann” After I show it
tonight he’s gonna shell out the cash
for it
MATHERS
(to Jon)

And I’ve been trying to find and destroy
Max Castle’s film “Blind” for twenty
years

JON
I just did that I burned it

MATHERS
The print Yes that’s good But I’m
talking about the negative

Jon surges with apprehension sits up staring at Mathers

then Sharkey

Sharkey gives a somber nod gesturing towards

Mathers
JON
You gotta be kidding me
MATHERS
Yes There’s a negative
JON
Shit
MATHERS
The “Orphans” weren’t sure it existed
Now somehow they know I think their
plan is to slip it into the television
coverage of the next Olympics
SHARKEY
-- Supposedly going to be seen by three
times as many people as the last one
All over the world
MATHERS
I can’t get the FBI involved until I have
more of a case against the Orphans
JON
How will we ever get enough evidence
They’ve been following me each step of
the way When I find out something they
find it out too
Jon gets HIT with a realization -- it shows on his face
SHARKEY
What man
JON
Claire
MATHERS and SHARKEY
What

JON
She’s always dismissing the idea that the
Orphans are dangerous Tried to sell me
on this “brochure” about them being a
legit preservation society

MATHERS
That’s their cover
JON
Every move she and I made they found out
about Zipsky Friedrich

Jon’s phone RINGS The machine answers
CLAIRE’S VOICE
(from machine)
Jon Jon Are you there

They all look at each other Jon ANSWERS

JON
Hello

INTERCUT WITH
CLOSE ON CLAIRE - USING CELL PHONE
Claire looks around speaking low

CLAIRE
I’ve got some big news

JON
Do you

CLAIRE
Colby Mathers --

JON
-- Is right here

Claire blanches A pause Mathers looks up at Jon

CLAIRE
Jon I want you to listen to me but
don’t react in a way that would tip off
Colby Okay Colby is a liar

JON
You don’t say

CLAIRE
I know he’s been a friend of mine but
now I know he’s a liar The Orphans of
the Storm --

JON
Did they get you the New Yorker job

CLAIRE
I GOT ME THE NEW YORKER JOB

JON
Oh Okay I see That’s convincing

CLAIRE
Jon the Orphans of the Storm is truly
just a film preservation society Colby
is the one who is in a death cult

JON
Did Dr Byx tell you that When you
talked to him on your cell phone

Claire sighs rubs her forehead lights a cigarette

CLAIRE
Dr Byx showed me all the legal
documents Interpol is after Colby
He’s a suspect in murders and art theft
all over Europe

JON
I had to be brainwashed by the film to
think I loved you Fuck your lies -- and

fuck you

Jon slams down the phone In true anguish rubs his eyes
slumps against the wall Then suddenly he stiffens and
turns to Sharkey and Colby

JON (contd)
She probably told Byx about Olga

INT COLBY’S RENTAL CAR - MOVING

Colby races along passing cars Jon’s in the passenger
seat Sharkey’s in back

EXT MARIAS HOUSE - LATER

Jon and Colby POUND on the front door Sharkey just watches
Jon picks up a STONE from the walkway and TAPS the window
beside the door -- trying to crack the glass The entire
window SHATTERS making a noise Colby frowns at Jon then
leans in reaching over toward the inside door knob He gets
the door open

INT MARIA’S LIVING ROOM
Jon Colby and Sharkey cautiously step inside

JON
Olga Maria

The place has been RANSACKED -- cyclone level

They turn to see -- MARIA (OLGA) DEAD lying at the BASE of
her STAIRCASE her NECK TWISTED

Jon gags stumbles backwards Colby rushes to Olga checks
for a pulse His expression confirms the death Sharkey has
a weird sick slight smile (as if it’s all “cool”)

MATHERS
(looking around)
If anything was here they would have
found it

SHARKEY
Aw hell Maybe not What are we
talking about A twenty-four-frame film
negative All white frames probably

Sharkey begins to randomly hunt through the MESS Jon
continues to recover from the sight of the dead woman

MATHERS
(to Jon)
The most likely places to find anything
related to Max Castle were Zipsky’s place
and here I don’t know where to go next

JON
(looking across the room)
Cal- - igari

MATHERS
What

Mathers follows his gaze to a --

MOUNTED STAINED GLASS ART PIECE

Sitting on a window ledge illuminated by sunlight It shows
a DISTORTED EXPRESSIONISTIC CITY SKYLINE -- much like the
sets of “Caligari”

WIDE ON ROOM

Mathers walks toward the glass piece Jon follows Sharkey
drops his search and joins them

STAINED GLASS

Above the crooked buildings is a solid WHITE SKY made up of
SQUARES in an AMORPHOUS SHAPE

WIDE ON ROOM
The three men stare at the stained glass

MATHERS (cont’d)
What’s the significance of this

JON
Robert Weine was --
MATHERS
I know A cult member In Germany like

Castle

Jon moves right up to the glass studies the bottom corner

JON
It’s signed “Max Kassel”

MATHERS
They didn’t take it Must be no use to
them

SHARKEY

Do you think there’s a clue in there

JON
I don’t know Could there be

Mathers and Sharkey move in as close as Jon They all study
the glass

MATHERS
Just buildings and a sky

JON
(realizing)
White sky Oh my God Glass Glass
It’s totally possible to use glass

Jon pulls his wallet removes the OLD PACKING SLIP from the
“Judas” canister turns it to the backside to see the
NUMBERED DIAGRAM He compares it to the SKY portion of the
glass

JON (contd)
The sky portion -- all white -- it’s
shaped just like this diagram -- The
numbers must indicate what order to put
the pieces See One through twenty-
four Twenty-four frames One-second
film It’s the negative for the film
“Blind”

A beat as all of them look between the diagram and the SQUARE
GLASS PIECES which make up the SKY

Mather suddenly looks around sees a large STONE STATUE He
picks it up takes a big swing at the stained glass -- and
Sharkey DEFLECTS the blow grapples with Mathers They FALL -
- with Mathers hitting the corner of a table with the back of
his head Sharkey adrenaline pumping uses the statue to
SMASH Mather’s head

JON (contd)
SHARKEY WHAT ARE YOU --

Mathers seems to be DEAD BLEEDING Sharkey pulls out a
HANDGUN and aims right at Jon

SHARKEY
No one’s going to destroy that Don’t
even think about fucking with me
(grinning eerily)
Max Castle’s ultimate lost film

Sharkey takes the diagram out of Jon’s hand

JON
YOU YOURE AN “ORPHAN”

SHARKEY
(guffaws loudly)
Fuck no Jon I am the owner of what is
going to be one of the great theaters in
film history

feels his stomach He lifts his garment -- there’s a BLOOD-
STAINED BANDAGE across his STOMACH

Ohhh God

Jon with difficulty sits up looks at his stomach A long
beat of absorbing what this means He struggles to his feet

looks around A small bedside table made from a TREE STUMP
holds an array of basic medical supplies

In the corner straw baskets full over various indigenous
food -- cocoanuts bananas other tropical fruit

they try all the combinations Have they
gotten the right sequence Or Will
they come for me hoping I remember --
and try to torture it out of me Or do I
just wait here for the end of the world
Maybe I won’t even know when the end
comes I’1l just live out the rest of my
