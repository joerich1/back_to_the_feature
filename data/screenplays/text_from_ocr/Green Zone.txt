OVER A BLACK SCREEN

We hear a dull percussive thud Followed by another and
another Each gaining in power over the last It is the
sound of shock preceding awe Words roll by on the screen

“My fellow citizens at this hour American and coalition
forces are in the early stages of military operations to
disarm Iraq to free its people and to defend the world from
grave danger” - President Bush addressing the nation
3192003

The words on screen fade back to black except for the date
3192003 To this is added another word Baghdad The
pounding intensifies The kind of sound that registers in
your skull and sits in your stomach

CUT TO
INT BAGHDAD HOME — KITCHEN - NIGHT

The word Baghdad carries over as a disheveled MAN crosses the
room The only light is sourced by the intermittent flashes
that bleed in squares around the drawn curtains of the
windows The man SEYYED is determined to start his day

Dishes rattle around him as he pours bottled water into a
long handled cezves

The flame off a match brings his eyes to life as he leans
down to light the ring on a gas burner Carefully adjusting
the flame he seems immune to the atmospherics around him

Another bomb goes off as he sets the cezves to boil It
gives him a moment to consider his surroundings

On the wall are framed photographs Skittered and skittering
askew as the reverb of the bombing throbs through the wall
They are mostly family photographs a history

Seyyed in a cap and gown at an AMERICAN UNIVERSITY Seyyed
in the uniform of an Iraqi Army Colonel Handsome prideful
Seyyed with his wife MAHA

In a few others the two of them with a BABY BOY And then
Maha disappears from the photos The glass rattles against
the frames as the world of Baghdad rocks and rolls

Methodically ritually Seyyed spoons coffee onto the surface
of the boiling water He stirs it twice clockwise pulls
twice up and down Then another spoonful of grounds

Another bomb goes off They’re getting closer

More method more ritual as he pulls the cezves from the
fire The now boiling grounds settle Then

He eases the pot back over the flame mutters the Arabic for
Mecca The mix boils again He pulls it away to settle

He sets the pot back on the flame Medina As it boils
again he pulls it away The grounds settle again

He sets the pot back over the flame Jerusalem A final
boil Another EXPLOSION That one was close Dust sifts
down from the ceiling

Seyyed decides to boil it one last time Baghdad

Sensing something he looks to the door His 8-year-old son
(AYAD) stands trembling just awoken A beat

MICHAELS
This is it this is it

The doorkickers check to make sure they’re locked and loaded

SNAP The last lock comes off Deep breaths Miller sets
his palm on it pushes It opens about three inches before
the bottom of the door grinds into the floor

Miller nods to Potts and Michaels They rear back
simultaneously kick it in It BOOMS back to reveal

Nothing A LARGE EMPTY SPACE Relief and disappointment
Hoods being pulled back

They enter The only thing here is a beat-up METAL FRAME
Thirty feet long it had a series of semi-circular grooves
across and along it Miller checks it out He holds his
hands over it palms facing each other eyeballing

The distance from groove start to groove end
MILLER
Sims you’re EOD What’s the
radius of a SCUD missile

That buzzes the men As Sims tries to recall the number

SIMS
Um ah twenty-nine and a half
inches Give or take a centimeter

Miller nods to himself then paces the floor looking about
and then at ‘SOMETHING’ on the floor Crusty Dried It
seems to run roughly in two parallel lines both of which are
bisected by a third line

MILLER
It’s like a letter ‘H’

WILKINS
Its pigeon shit Chief

Miller unhooks a FLASHLIGHT from his belt shines it up at
the ceiling shadows above the shit There’s nothing up
there just the flat of the roof
MILLER
No place to roost They were
sitting on a gantry crane maybe

WILKINS

Who’s the good Nazi and who’s the
bad Nazi The best thing to do is

As Freddy restates the question his words are drowned out by
the rotor chop of a BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER It passes
overhead A dust storm as it sets down

Lt Briggs leads the Task Force 20 exodus off the chopper
He zeros in on Miller They speak over the noise

BRIGGS
Miller we are here to pick up
whatever it is you got

MILLER
I have the situation under control

Briggs looks over to where Potts and Perry cover the General

BRIGGS
And you did a good job so far
kiddo but I got orders This goes

a General on the horn to ream your
ass That make you feel better

Cursing to himself Miller waves off Perry and Potts Briggs
just nods like now everything is right with the world

The General and Bodyguard One are FLEX-CUFFED hustled onto
the Blackhawk‘s flight deck

‘Miller steps back with his men to watch them go

On the flight deck the General says something to one of the
“Brabic Speakers who passes it onto Briggs The General
points with his chin at Miller

Briggs hops down to the ground He starts toward Miller
followed by other members of TF-20

BRIGGS (CONT’D)
General says you got his book

MILLER
(selling it well)
I don’t know what the fuck you’re
talking about

Briggs dispenses with formalities and just starts patting
down Miller’s pockets Miller knocks his hand away

MILLER (CONTD)
What the fuck

Briggs’ eyes flash to life

BRIGGS
Hard way’s fine with me

Whump-whump Miller staggers back after Briggs’ one-two

Michaels starts forward but is blocked by a TF-20 In fact
they’re all manned-up twice over

MILLER
Its alright
(deep breath)
It’s between us

Miller squares up waits for Briggs to come to him It isn’t
pretty Miller manages to get in a couple of shots but
Briggs has trained years for this shit And he likes it

Some of the Army diggers are coming over to watch now
A kick spins Miller around he lands on his knees

BRIGGS
Okay give me the book Come on

A dark upwards glance from Miller He knows he can’t win
All the same he lurches up charges Briggs

Briggs lets him have it A flurry sends Miller reeling As
he staggers the only thing that keeps him on his feet is that
he runs into Freddy Freddy staggers barely holds him up

The two of them locked in a momentary look Freddy’s eyes
widen as Miller presses the black book into his hands

As Briggs grabs Miller’s shoulder sends him to the ground
Miller’s sweaty face is caked in dust as Briggs sets a knee
between his shoulder blades Pinned vanquished as Briggs
goes through his pockets Nothing

Briggs flashes his eyes toward the others Potts Briggs and
Perry don’t go happily as they are patted down As a TF-20
pats down Perrys legs

The TF-20 guy searching Potts hits pay dirt

TF-20 ONE
Got it

He pulls out a black book from a cargo pocket holds it up

POTTS

TF-20 flips the pages shoves it back into Potts’ hands

ON BRIGGS
Realizes he’s come up short He takes his knee from Miller’s
shoulder blades hand signals his men back to the Blackhawk
As the dust starts to whip up he pats Miller on the cheek
BRIGGS
Gotta try to remember We’re on
the same side

Briggs head for the helicopter Onboard they’re pulling
BLACK HOODS over the Iraqis’ heads

Perry Michaels and Potts step to Miller’s assistance shield
him from the dust as the Blackhawk takes off Miller sits

You should Because she’s fucking

Zubaidi they leak her a story she
writes it New York Times prints
it And the next day the Vice
President’s on Meet the Press
quoting the story she wrote that
they leaked her in the first place

As Miller tries to follow this

Who is Zubaidi anyhow

BROWN
A liar thief score settler The
thing he does best is tell
Washington what they want to hear
In 1998 I tried to have a burn
notice placed on him

MILLER
What’s that

BROWN
It means he was to be treated as a
completely unreliable source of
intelligence I was overruled

MILLER
By the New York Times

BROWN
If the neo-cons in DC thought
anyone would vote for him the
election would be tomorrow

MILLER
Why

Because he’s their beard He’s
gonna let them run the crazy free

back here Now

Rattled Dayne starts down the hall

MILLER
On the ground bleeding His eyes flicker to --
-- Briggs who points his rifle down at Seyyed --

-- to the funny little carpet on the floor --

Seyyed

-- to Dayne’s legs as she continues walking down the hall --

As Miller reaches for Seyyed’s pistol still in his belt

BOOM Dayne is-flung into the ceiling an instant after

stepping on the land mine in the floor under the carpet

Briggs reaction gives Miller the moment to draw the pistol
aim even as Briggs swings the rifle back around BANG-BANG
The sound reverbs as Briggs falls down gurgling blood his

throat ripped apart

Seyyed lurches to his feet Miller aims the 45 at him

MILLER
Stop

They look at each other a beat Dayne MOANS
Seyyed goes over to where Dayne rests akimbo

SEYYED
The leg is gone At the knee

Seyyed pulls off his shirt twists it into a tourniquet She

SCREAMS as he begins to twists it around her thigh

SEYYED (CONT‘D)

What would you do Go to prison
Go to die Never see your son
again What would you do

Seyyed shouts in Iraqi His sister and Ayad emerge from the
bedroom He instructs her she takes hold of the tourniquet

He looks to Miller who still points the pistol

SEYYED (CONT’D)

I met people at airports I risked
everything Saddam killed my wife
For what This To offer a truth
no one wants What would you do

MILLER
(a beat)
I don’t know

SEYYED
Then go home If you don’t have
the answers go home

MILLER
How’s that gonna solve anything

The two of them just look at each other Finally Miller
decides gestures at Briggs who has stopped gurgling

MILLER (CONTD)

Use his radio Tell them that
there are troops in contact
Request a 9-line a medevac

MR ROSE
They need to work on their
omelettes

BROWN

olives

Rose shakes his head Brown can keep that shit But Brown’s
already looking past him

Here comes Miller Fresh from triage looking a sight
Headed straight for them

BROWN (CONT’D)
You know Mr Miller I believe

But as Rose looks over Miller is bringing his 45 level

Rose tries to get up ends up falling out of his chair As
he cowers and Brown’s eyes widen -- oh fuck —-

BROWN (CONT’D)
I do not make policy When I
finally get read the riot act I
have to go along

-- Miller sets the gun on the table

MILLER
I quit I’m done with you

BROWN
(after the relief)

for it

MILLER

The Adhan is finished Zubaidi rises up from prayer and
FLASHBULBS go off A photo-op

Zubaidi stands steps to greet and shake hands with an IMAN
who stands with Poundstone More FLASHES Another photo-op

Poundstone looks down uncomfortable with the fact that he’s
in his stocking feet in the mosque
CUT TO
BAGHDAD ALLEYWAY

We follow a man CLOSE We only see him from the shoulders
down But he has a familiar limp Freddy

Wearing a long jacket We’re just aware of the GUN BARREL
sticking out from the bottom He SINGS TO HIMSELF

FREDDY
Now cuts like a knife but it feels
so right Nah nah nah nah nah
nah nah nah

Continue with him into

THE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE MOSQUE
As Zubaidi and Poundstone move toward the cars and Freddy
slips through the cracks Poundstone still trying to get one
of his shoes back on
FREDDY (CONTD)
(final words)
Hey Mutherfucker

Freddy revealing and raising an AK-47

ZUBAIDI and POUNDSTONE

Zubaidi looks indignant more than anything Poundstone has

that kind of ’oh shit’ Oswald look on his face And all the

security are just a beat too slow as

FREDDY

Lets it rip Shots are returned but too late for Zubaidi

EXT BAGHDAD STREET SADR CITY - DAY

An urban anthill Seyyed cautiously exits a Sadr hovel
Takes a careful look up and down the street

Satisfied he motions Ayad to follow The two of them head
off disappear into the teeming streets

CUT TO
MILLER

Sitting in an AIRPLANE On his way home Looking out the
window He’s just taken off

Baghdad whizzes by below A certain place A certain time
An opportunity lost And a vacuum created A relentless
momentum toward chaos has begun

The city gets smaller and smaller The Bryan Adams kicks in

FADE TO BLACK

The End
