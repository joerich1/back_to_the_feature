ravine towards some high-rise buildings while ALYOSHA takes another trail
straight down into the ravine

lights and benches standing next to trash cans ALYOSHA walks a little
way along the footpath then takes another trail that veers off to the side

cigarettes and a lighter from the windowsill lights up takes a deep drag and
blows the smoke out of the window

Still leaning against the countertop BORIS cracks open a cabinet under the sink
sees an empty wine bottle next to the trash can and closes the cabinet again After
amoment’s hesitation he crosses over to the table and his hand shoots out to
quickly push the home button on ZHENYA’s phone The phone lights up with the
password screen it’s locked BORIS leaves the phone where it is turns away and
joins ZHENYA in the balcony stopping just across the threshold

BORIS

In the twilight ZHENYA and ANTON are making tantric love on his bed

39 INT ANTON’S PLACE BEDROOM NIGHT

Later ZHENYA sits with her back to the headboard illuminated by a night light
holding a glass of wine and wearing nothing but ANTON’s shirt Her legs are
stretched out in front of her one slung over the other ANTON is lying on his back
covered up to his waist His hands are on his stomach his head is on the pillow
his eyes are closed ZHENYA watches his profile and listens to his rhythmic
breathing

ZHENYA
Are you asleep
He doesn’t respond
ZHENYA
Hey
Silence
ZHENYA
It’s not fair
He remains silent
ZHENYA

I love you Do you hear me I’ve never loved anyone
Except my mom when I was little But she was so cold to
me Never a kind word or a warm touch Nothing but
discipline order chores homework Mean lonely bitch

ANTON

(without opening his eyes)
Still alive and well I hope

ZHENYA
Alive And yes generally well We almost never talk Every
time I call we end up fighting Later I can’t even figure out
what started it

She takes a sip of her wine

ZHENYA
I didn’t even know what love meant until I met you I never
loved my husband And there wasn’t really anyone before
him Even with him I got pregnant by accident He was so
happy kept asking me to marry him Said everything was
going to be okay because we were together But I didn’t
want any of it I was so scared Scared to get an abortion
scared to keep it really didn’t want a kid When I went
into labor I thought I was going to die They had to take me
to the ICU And when they brought him to me afterwards I
couldn’t even look at him I felt outright disgusted My milk
never even came in But then life went on things settled
down and we fell into this inertia

ANTON
(without moving or opening his eyes)
Without love Life should never be loveless

ZHENYA
To this day when I look at him or even think about him like
now for example I have this feeling that I made a mistake
which I can’t fix I blame him I blame myself All want is
to be happy I’m an evil bitch right

ANTON opens his eyes turns his head and looks at her

ANTON
The most beautiful evil bitch in the world

ZHENYA
Do you really love me

ANTON

bathrobe is open over her naked body She is standing in the middle of ALYOSHA’s
room holding her iPhone to her ear

ZHENYA
(into the phone)
Did you see Alyosha last night

BORIS
No I didn’t come home last night Why what’s happened

ZHENYA
I just got a call from school He didn’t show up yesterday or
today

BORIS

ZHENYA
His homeroom teacher

BORIS

ZHENYA
That he didn’t show up to school yesterday or today Are
you deaf

BORIS
Did he come home

ZHENYA
I don’t know got back late last night myself Didn’t check
his room thought he’d be asleep I slept in this morning
thought he’d already left as always He’s so independent
And I can’t reach his phone Has he called you

BORIS
No
ZHENYA
Oh God
BORIS

Don’t get hysterical Well find him he’ll be fine We should
call what’s his name his friend

ZHENYA
I already spoke to Misha He hasnt seen him either
yesterday or today

BORIS
I see Where are you now

ZHENYA
At home

BORIS
And you can’t tell whether or not he was home last night
ZHENYA

BORIS
Why not How hard can it be

ZHENYA
Oh gee I don’t know Why don’t you come home and see for
yourself
BORIS

I’m at work in case you forgot

ZHENYA
Do you understand that no one has heard from him in over
24 hours
BORIS

He could be coming up in the elevator as we speak Or
walking home right now I don’t know I think you’re
overreacting He probably did something bad got an F or
lost his tablet And now he’s afraid of how youll react so
he’s staying away

ZHENYA
You mean it’s all my fault again

BORIS
You don’t even know whether or not he’s been home Most
likely he was there last night Hello

ZHENYA
Well I’m calling the cops And you can stay at work and keep
deliberating over what might and might not have happened
Idiot

49 INT SELF-SERVE CAFETERIA DAY

BORIS
Can’t we do this without insults Hello

Realizing that ZHENYA has hung up on him BORIS gnashes his teeth heads
towards the counter and picks up a tray His COWORKER waves to him from the
head of the line

50 INT SLEPTSOVS’ PLACE ALYOSHA’S ROOM DAY

A young female POLICE OFFICER moves around the room taking photos of
the furniture and various items with her camera She finishes up and heads into
the kitchen

51 INT SLEPTSOVS’ PLACE KITCHEN DAY

ZHENYA is sitting at the table her face free of makeup and her hair tied back into a
ponytail A weary-looking plainclothes DETECTIVE sits across from her writing
on a sheet of paper A thin folder and a toothbrush in a sealed plastic bag lie on the
table next to him

The POLICE OFFICER enters the kitchen

POLICE OFFICER
I’m done

DETECTIVE
Great thanks
(nods at the toothbrush)
Take this and wait for me in the car We have to make one more
stop

The POLICE OFFICER nods and leaves without even a glance at ZHENYA

DETECTIVE
Well what can I tell you I see no evidence of criminal
activity
ZHENYA

What do you mean “criminal activity’

DETECTIVE
Well you know sometimes parents will do away with their
kid then file a missing person’s report

ZHENYA
And you thought that’s what I’d done

DETECTIVE
We always start out with that theory But what you have
here is a runaway Happens all the time 12 years old
rebellious age hormones out of control Give him a few
days hell be back Of course we could go to the precinct
spend a few hours on a detailed deposition Probably not
today though we would need your husband to be present as
well But in any event this case is unlikely to go beyonda
preliminary inquiry

ZHENYA
You said there’s no evidence of criminal activity But what if
he was kidnapped Because can’t imagine where he could
be

DETECTIVE
I’m sure he’s just bumming around the neighborhood He
wont last long He’s used to a comfortable life And you have
a comfortable life here You can’t even imagine the kinds of
conditions kids come back to Because the streets are worse

than any home no matter how shitty Now as for a possible
kidnapping Here’s how the system works first we conduct
a preliminary inquiry which includes interviews with the
parents relatives friends possible witnesses and so forth
We are short on resources plus we have other cases to
investigate murders rapes assaults robberies and so
forth So the preliminary inquiry could take a few days If
the runaway hasn’t turned up by then and if we have
grounds by which I mean evidence then we open a missing
person’s case Then if the case investigation presents more
grounds meaning more evidence - suspicion of murder
kidnapping and so forth - it becomes a criminal case But
that’s up to the Investigative Committee You can imagine
how long that takes and the mountain of paperwork it
requires By then the runaways have normally come back
and run away all over again

ZHENYA
So youre just going to do nothing

DETECTIVE
I’m giving you a realistic picture We are obligated to act
And we will But in this specific case The system does not
have the resources or the time to chase after every kid

ZHENYA
I see This case is going straight in the trash So what am I
supposed to do Sit around waiting for him to come back
What if he doesn’t come back

DETECTIVE
Statistics dont lie In the overwhelming majority of cases
teenage runaways come back after a week ten days at the
most But let me offer you some advice if you want
somebody to actually look for him and if you want them to
start as soon as possible go online find the missing child
search team website and give them a call - theyll tell you
what info they need It’s staffed with volunteers working
their asses off round the clock No bureaucracy anda
streamlined highly effective response protocol How do I
know Past experience of working together with good
results Anyway here’s my phone number
(hands her his card)
I have yours Well be in touch

The DETECTIVE tucks the sheet of paper he was writing on into the folder and
rises from the table

ZHENYA examines the card he handed her

ZHENYA

And that’s it

DETECTIVE
For now
ZHENYA
The drowning man’s rescue is in his own hands is that
right
DETECTIVE
His own hands and his feet his head and most importantly
his heart
ZHENYA
Unbelievable
DETECTIVE

Trust me had you gotten any other detective they’d have
been much more assertive with you and much less helpful
to put it mildly It’s not that I’m such a nice guy I’m just
trying to save time my own yours and the search team’s
The sooner you contact them and the sooner they get
started the sooner they will find your little slacker hanging
out on the street or at the mall somewhere or most likely
hiding out at a friend’s house while their parents are away
for a few days and they’ve got the place to themselves So
get moving Or wait Your choice That’s it I have to go now

ZHENYA
But if he’s at a friend’s house why didn’t he tell me

DETECTIVE
That’s a question only you can answer

questions about your son Alyosha
Meanwhile my team is interviewing your neighbors and
possible witnesses on the street outside the building in the

The young woman in camo pants who was talking to the neighbor enters the living
room smartphone in hand

LENA

(to the COORDINATOR)
Nothing of interest from the neighbors

COORDINATOR
Nothing at all

LENA leaves

LENA
No one saw or heard him today or yesterday Cant
remember anything specific More of our people have
arrived We set up a command post behind the building ()
and brought the fliers

COORDINATOR
You printed them out Excellent

LENA
Ill keep canvassing the building

COORDINATOR
Yes stay on it

COORDINATOR
So depending on what the canvassing yields we will focus
on specific locations and objectives You and are going to
finish up here and head on to the precinct to see the
detective in charge - rarely happens by the way even in
Moscow so you really lucked out there He promised to give
us access to the security cameras This is a big deal and
could really simplify our task Next It’s getting late and the
boy will need a place to spend the night Since it’s not
exactly spring outside well be searching entrance lobbies
and stairwells Well ask the detective for the entry codes I
expect he’ll cooperate So let’s start from the beginning

He checks his notepad

COORDINATOR
Alyosha Sleptsov 12 years old looks 10 no distinctive
features healthy approximately 5’1” dark blond hair last
seen wearing blue jeans red hooded jacket blue backpack
white sneakers () Two days ago left for school at the usual
time and by the looks of things hasn’t been home since His
cell phone is unreachable but we will keep dialing it
anyway Now I need you to tell me what are the boy’s
interests Hobbies sports dreams of building a space
station traveling the world and so on

ZHENYA
He doesn’t have any hobbies And he’s not interested in
sports either I guess he spends most of his time at home

COORDINATOR
You guess Ah I see At home that means on the computer
His laptop is on his desk right

BORIS
Yes but we try to limit his online time

ZHENYA
Especially you

COORDINATOR
Let’s keep personal issues out of this Can we access the
computer

BORIS
Of course
ZHENYA
Yes
COORDINATOR

Excellent You have access to his email social network
accounts phone numbers and addresses of his buddies and
girlfriends

ZHENYA
He only has one friend I guess Misha Kuznetsov

COORDINATOR
Guessing again Fine

BORIS
T have all his user names and passwords And he does only
have one friend Misha I mean in real life As far as the
social networks

COORDINATOR
I see Any close relatives he could have gone to see
Grandmas grandpas uncles and aunts cousins

ZHENYA
No one on my husband’s side On my side just my mother
She lives outside Moscow

BORIS
But it’s probably been about three years since we last
visited I doubt the kid remembers

COORDINATOR
The kid I see I do hope you called the grandmother And
she said she hadn’t seen the boy correct

ZHENYA
I can’t reach her Actually things between us are you
know
COORDINATOR
What do you mean you can’t reach her

ZHENYA
First she wouldn’t pick up the phone and now it says “the
number you dialed is unavailable” Her connection was
always shoddy

BORIS
Her connection is fine She’s the one who’s “shoddy”

COORDINATOR
Grandma’s quite a character then I see Did you try the
neighbors
ZHENYA
I don’t have any of their numbers

BORIS
It’s her summer home her plot her house her neighbors
It’s best to stay out of it to avoid a heap of trouble

COORDINATOR
Could she be hiding Alyosha Say if he asked her to

ZHENYA shrugs
ZHENYA
I don’t think so
BORIS chortles
BORIS

She’s capable of anything Stalin in a skirt

ZHENYA
That’s enough How would he even get there We only ever
drove there And my mother wouldnt exactly be happy to
see him You know how she is

BORIS
What if they’ve been talking in secret Isn’t it possible She’s
a real trouble maker Damn thought he’d seemed
withdrawn lately She must’ve been filling his head with
nonsense this entire time

ZHENYA
But she doesn’t love him She doesn’t love anyone

BORIS
Loves doesn’t love She’s using the kid against me And
against you too

COORDINATOR
(cuts them off)
Anyway You have to go see the grandmother right away
Where exactly does she live outside Moscow

ZHENYA
At her summer home All year round

BORIS
It’s towards Kiev Hard to explain The turnoff from the
highway is difficult to spot

COORDINATOR
Do you have a car

BORIS
Yes
COORDINATOR
How long is the drive
BORIS

About three hours Maybe two and a half

COORDINATOR
OK here’s what well do Give me the contact info for all his
friends and acquaintances including his homeroom

user names and passwords I’ll take the laptop well go
through it at our headquarters and then decide on the next
step And you the both of you get your car and go see dear
old granny Lena will go with you she’s a highly skilled
operative Or rather shell follow you in her own car
Meanwhile keep trying to reach the grandmother When you
get there check everything carefully don’t overlook
anything and call me right away to tell me how it went no
matter what happens Can you handle that Someone will
stay here in case the boy comes back

ZHENYA
Oh for God’s sake
(to BORIS)
Can’t you turn this off Please I have a headache

BORIS hesitates then switches off the radio

They drive in silence for a long time

ZHENYA

(glances in the rearview mirror at LENA’s car following
closely behind)
Fuck he really knows how to make life difficult Perfect
timing too the little shit

ZHENYA
What if something terrible’s happened to him

BORIS
Don’t think like that He’s fine He’ll get what’s coming to
him though I’ll see to that

ZHENYA digs through her purse and fishes out her cigarettes

BORIS
You can’t smoke in here anymore

ZHENYA
Right terribly sorry You’ve got a pregnant woman to
chauffeur around now how could I forget I’ll blow it out
the window

BORIS
No I said you can’t

ZHENYA
Or youll do what Throw me out of the car

She lights up spitefully

BORIS
I see your headache has gone

He rolls down all the windows puts the fan on high and switches the radio back
on turning the volume all the way up It’s now playing a different tune

The wind roars through the car beating against their faces and tearing at their
hair An air current knocks the ash from the tip of ZHENYA’s cigarette After only a
few drags she tosses it out of the window and pushes the window button on the
passenger door The glass doesn’t budge BORIS has locked the windows in the
open position

ZHENYA
Close the windows

BORIS grins staring at the road
ZHENYA leans back in her seat and covers her face with her hands

60 EXT FIELD COUNTRY ROAD NIGHT

BORIS’ car turns off the highway windows rolled up and the radio now silent and
LENA’s all-terrain vehicle follows it down a barely paved two-lane road with half
the street lights broken The road cuts through expanses of fields fringed by
woods

61 EXT WOODS COUNTRY ROAD NIGHT

Leaving the fields behind them the two cars enter the woods which soon grow
increasingly sparse giving way to the concrete fencing of summer home
communities

62 INT BORIS’ CAR SUMMER HOME COMMUNITY NIGHT
BORIS’ car pulls up to the summer home community’s automatic metal gates
LENA’s vehicle stops a few feet to the right

BORIS
Great they put up a gate What do we do now Ram it

ZHENYA
The side door is open

BORIS
We just leave the car here

ZHENYA
Well what do you suggest

She opens the door and climbs out of the car BORIS switches gears and backs
away from the gate His headlights illuminate ZHENYA and LENA who has joined
her outside BORIS parks the car so as not to block the gate

63 EXT SUMMER HOME COMMUNITY SIDE DOOR NIGHT

ZHENYA BORIS and LENA who is armed with a long black flashlight leave their
cars outside the gate and enter the community through the side door in the gate

64 EXT SUMMER HOME COMMUNITY STREET NIGHT

For a long while ZHENYA BORIS and LENA walk along a sparsely lit deserted
street bordered by fences of all shapes and sizes surrounding even more diverse
summer homes None of the houses are particularly grand and the lots
surrounding them are small just a little over a tenth of an acre All the windows
appear to be dark Suddenly an enraged dog begins to rattle his chain in an
agitated frenzy from behind yet another fence

65 EXT SUMMER HOME COMMUNITY ZHENYA’S MOTHERS HOUSE FENCE
NIGHT

ZHENYA BORIS and LENA are standing in front of the garden gate of a tall solid
wooden fence badly in need of a coat of paint All they can see of the house beyond
the fence is the ridge of its roof and the brick chimney ZHENYA presses the
doorbell next to the gate and they hear a distant muffled trill coming from
somewhere deep in the house Silence ZHENYA leans on the doorbell for a few
long moments They hear no movement on the other side of the fence

BORIS
She won’t open up Probably raising the barricades as we
speak She’s such a

ZHENYA
Enough You make her sound like a complete monster

LENA
Is there any other way in

BORIS
Only over the fence
ZHENYA
We don’t havea key
LENA

I see
LENA examines the gate then walks along the fence and rounds the corner

BORIS
Where is she going

ZHENYA
How should I know

ZHENYA rings the bell again and phones her mother at the same time No
response

Suddenly they hear crunching and cracking sounds followed by the dull thump of
something hitting the ground on the other side of the wall

LENA (0S)
Son of a Fuck

She reaches the gate and after a few seconds of fiddling with the lock opens it
from the inside

66 EXT SUMMER HOME COMMUNITY ZHENYA’S MOTHER’S HOUSE FRONT
YARD NIGHT
ZHENYA is standing outside the front door to her mother’s house

ZHENYA
Mom Open up it’s me

Behind the door all is silent

LENA and BORIS circle the house from opposite directions The dark rectangle ofa
shed looms in the corner of the plot LENA shines her flashlight into the windows
of the house Suddenly in one of the windows the spotlight lands on a woman’s
pallid face which immediately disappears back into the darkness

LENA
She’s in there

LENA wheels around and walks quickly back to the front door
ZHENYA hammers on the door with her fist

ZHENYA
Mom open up Alyosha is missing

67 INT ZHENYA’S MOTHER’S HOUSE KITCHEN NIGHT

A small oil lamp is burning under an icon on a shelf in the corner ZHENYA is sitting
on a chair at the table Her MOTHER removes a tea kettle from the stove
carries it to the sink and fills it

MOTHER
I nearly had a heart attack First the doorbell starts ringing
in the middle of the night like there’s a fire Then I hear
someone climbing over the fence Oh dear Lord in heaven
And I can’t find my phone What am I supposed to do

She turns off the faucet replaces the kettle on the stove takes a box of matches
and lights the gas burner under the kettle

MOTHER
You could’ve at least warned me

ZHENYA

I’ve been calling you nonstop And don’t tell me you didn’t
hear the phone

MOTHER
As God is my witness

ZHENYA
I know you First you wouldnt pick up then you turned it
off

MOTHER

I haven’t seen it since this morning Can’t imagine where it’s
got to I must have lost it Ah to hell with it

Zhenya’s MOTHER takes four tea bowls from a shelf places them on the table
then takes a seat and stares closely at ZHENYA

MOTHER
Tell me this my dear I just can’t figure out why you thought
your boy was here I can’t even remember the last time I
spoke to him Or to you Thank the Lord
(turns towards the icon in the corner and crosses herself)
And I don’t regret it for a second Not even a little What’s
that goddamned ape of yours doing skulking around
outside May God forgive me Didn’t you say you were
getting a divorce

ZHENYA
Your god and your devil are cut from the same cloth

MOTHER
Whatd you say What cloth You watch your mouth girl
Don’t be getting all smart And quit waggling your head at
me This is your mother you are talking to Have some
respect Or else scram and don’t let the door hit you on the

flashlight BORIS is on the ground holding the ladder steady LENA opens the bolt
with a click pushes open the door and peeks inside shining her flashlight around
the attic It illuminates the opposite slope of the roof the ceiling beams some
small bits of trash — and nothing else LENA locks the bolt and climbs down the
ladder

LENA
OK we’re done with the house Let’s check the shed

BORIS
He’s not here I can feel it He never was

LENA
Well check everything

69 INT ZHENYA’S MOTHER’S HOUSE KITCHEN NIGHT

BORIS enters the kitchen walks over to the table and sets down an ancient-model
cell phone LENA stops in the doorway ZHENYA looks inquiringly at BORIS who
shakes his head in response

MOTHER
So have you poked around every nook and cranny No sign
of him huh I don’t know why you even thought

She takes the phone from the table and pushes a few buttons

MOTHER
The battery is dead of course Where did you find it

BORIS
Under your bed

MOTHER
Must’ve fallen Well at least you found it Sit down have
some tea I don’t have anything to sweeten it though Just
some honey but it’s all crystallized

ZHENYA
No thanks Mom were going soon

MOTHER
Well aren’t you polite You two don’t seem all that torn up
about Alyosha going missing Must’ve made this sob story
up to get me feeling sorry for you is that it

She looks from ZHENYA to BORIS and back again then looks LENA up and down
with a mix of suspicion and disgust

MOTHER

You picked the wrong one to mess with I see right through
you You said you were getting a divorce Thought you could
saddle me with your fucking spawn huh Think again
(makes an obscene gesture)

I’ve told you before and Ill tell you again I’m not looking
after him

BORIS
Do you get any company here other than your TV

Zhenya’s MOTHER pointedly ignores him and continues to look at ZHENYA

MOTHER
Didn’t I tell you back when you were knocked up to come
to your senses You ignored then And I told you the day
will come when youll come crawling to your mother but it
will be too late
(raps a finger on the table)
Now you reap what you sow There’s your future

ZHENYA
Mom what the hell are you saying Have a little shame At
least in front of strangers

MOTHER
Don’t you lecture me I have nothing to be ashamed of This
is my house Snooping around here in the middle of the
night like thieves and with your appraiser too Trying to
make a fool of me I’m not signing the house over to you
don’t even think about it I’m leaving it to God

The tea kettle on the stove begins to whistle Zhenya’s MOTHER gets up and
switches off the gas

MOTHER
I have nothing to feed you Making ends meet on just my
pension With no help from you not one bit I’d die waiting
You wouldn’t spare a nail for my casket

70 INT BORIS’ CAR HIGHWAY BLUE HOUR

Predawn twilight BORIS and ZHENYA drive along the highway in a deathly
silence He is staring at the road ahead exhausted while she sleeps leaning away
from him towards the window her hands folded over her belly The car bounces
slightly on a pothole ZHENYA wakes up and looks at BORIS

ZHENYA
Where are we How much longer

BORIS
Another 40 minutes I think

ZHENYA
Put on some music will you

BORIS turns on the radio

BORIS
She gets more and more paranoid every year And all that
hatred Awful

ZHENYA
Like you’re bursting with love huh

BORIS
Why are you defending her

ZHENYA
Because she’s right

BORIS
About what That you can’t wait for her to croak

ZHENYA
Watch your language She’s right that she warned me not to
get involved with you not to have the baby not to be stupid
But stupid I was I listened to you instead “Everything will
be okay” you said “as long as we’re together” Now you tell
me how is it that you who wooed me with promises of love
and happiness and showered me with flowers in the end
brought me nothing but pain and disappointment Just an
insufferable shit-filled life

She watches his profile as he clenches his jaw staring at the road

ZHENYA
You know I never loved you I just couldnt live with her
anymore And I couldn’t get free of her on my own But I did
with you I used you At least that’s what thought And all
the while you were using me you needed a family I would’ve
been fine without you Really I just needed somebody to
move in with You were simply convenient Had you not
gotten me pregnant That clouded my judgment I shouldn’t
have listened to you I should’ve gotten the abortion and
that would’ve been that

BORIS
You should have Youre right it would have been better
For everyone

ZHENYA
You don’t say So what’s changed Are you a different
person Didn’t you just knock up another young idiot so you
can drag her down to hell with you And if your dick still
works in 10 or 12 years’ time youll do it all over again I
know it Poor girl I feel sorry for her You ruined my life Do
you understand that Thank God I finally met a good man
someone who doesn’t need anything from me except me

BORIS stomps on the brake turns off onto the shoulder and stops the car

ZHENYA

ZHENYA
Go ahead That’s the one thing you haven’t done to me yet

I’m not going anywhere

BORIS

He lifts his hand his eyes blazing terribly but instead of hitting her simply
clenches his fist until his knuckles turn white

ZHENYA
Fine Ill get out You bastard

ZHENYA climbs out of the car

ZHENYA
Don’t forget your son is missing

She slams the door shut with all her might
BORIS speeds off abruptly and drives away without looking back

BORIS

Early morning Walking in a dense line the search team is combing the ravine
that splits the Sleptsovs’ neighborhood in two A fog is creeping over the river

73 INT POLICE PRECINCT DAY

Morning The DETECTIVE is sitting a desk in front of a computer BORIS and the
COORDINATOR are standing behind him All three are watching footage from the
external security cameras BORIS is dressed in a waterproof outdoor jacket and
laced-up boots

The monitor shows a very long view of the building entrance The door opens and
ALYOSHA bursts out of the building wearing his jacket and a backpack on his
back He skips along the side of the building until he disappears from view Several
more people walk one after another in the same direction (Possibly a second
camera DETECTIVE
And that’s it None of the other cameras picked him up Not
on the way to school not around the mall which is like a
magnet to those kids

COORDINATOR
There’s a food court there And it’s a nice place to hang out

DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
not on the way to the bus stop or the taxi depot if say he
was headed towards the metro hoping to get to a train
station somewhere There are a few possibilities He either
turned down a street with no cameras - and there are
plenty of places like that - or he was careful to stay out of
camera range which is less likely Or somebody took him

BORIS
What do you mean “took him”

COORDINATOR
Kidnapped him
BORIS
Are you serious
COORDINATOR

This is no joking matter

BORIS
No but that’s impossible

DETECTIVE
Unfortunately it does happen
(to the COORDINATOR)
What have you got

COORDINATOR
Nothing from the canvassing yesterday Of course a lot of
time has lapsed By our standards Time to open a missing
person’s case Maybe even a criminal one

The DETECTIVE nods

COORDINATOR
We handed out the fliers took them to the emergency room
highway patrol the stores asked shopkeepers to keep them
by the registers We haven’t put any up yet A runaway
would see those and hole up somewhere then we’d never
find him

DETECTIVE
Naturally

COORDINATOR
We spent half the night combing the stairwells any place he
might have known the entry code to and spent the night
(to BORIS)
He really doesn’t have a lot of friends
(to both)
We are about to go talk to his best friend Didn’t get to do it
yesterday for reasons beyond our control Looks like they
have a secret spot “the base” they call it We found
references to it on Alyosha’s computer Any clue as to where
it might be

BORIS shrugs
DETECTIVE
Leave me 20 or so of your fliers I’ll hand them out around
the precinct
COORDINATOR
Of course

BORIS’ phone rings He checks the screen excuses himself and steps off to the
side

BORIS

cardboard empty soda bottles crushed McDonalds boxes and on one peeling wall
a poster of a vulgar half-naked woman eyes rolled back in affected ecstasy

On one of the pallets BORIS finds a tattered child-sized jean jacket He picks it up
examines it and turns to peer into the darkness at the search team operatives

getting hurt If anyone does have an accident though we
suspend the search and focus all efforts on helping our
friend First off contact the coordinator The only person
qualified to administer medical help is the doctor this
gentleman here

The COORDINATOR points at one of the operatives who raises a hand in response

A morgue technician emerges from the side somewhere wearing a lab coat that
was once white and uncovers the body

ZHENYA yelps then immediately clamps a hand over her mouth She stares at the
gurney her eyes bulging with horror

The blood drains from BORIS’ face He sways slightly as if punched in the chest by
an invisible fist his breath caught in his throat

ZHENYA
(holding a hand to her face)
It’s not him

They are looking at the disfigured body of a child face smashed beyond

recognition body covered with bruises and signs of putrefaction and a clotted
reddish-black mess where the sex organs should be

Alyosha has a birthmark right there on his chest
(looks helplessly at BORIS)

It’s not him

COORDINATOR

Are you sure

BORIS
Yes

ZHENYA

It’s not him The feet the hands the fingers — all different
Trembling she takes a step back

ZHENYA
Please take it away

BORIS moves towards her as if to catch her She motions for him to stop

The COORDINATOR nods to the morgue technician who covers the body with the
sheet and rolls the gurney around the corner and into the darkness

COORDINATOR
The proper thing would be to run a DNA analysis just to be
sure
BORIS

To be sure of what It’s not him

ZHENYA
We are absolutely certain it’s not him

COORDINATOR
You know sometimes people simply refuse to believe

ZHENYA
(raises her voice)

cops still haven’t opened a case Dragging it out as usual

Your detective it turns out is retiring in a few days - he has
other things on his mind

ZHENYA
(explodes)
Quite torturing us I told you plain as day it’s not him You
hear me It’s not him Not him (to BORIS) Say something

She stares desperately at BORIS then suddenly wrings her hands as tears literally
stream from her eyes She suddenly looks like a little girl

ZHENYA
I wanted you to suffer I wanted you to hurt you bastard I
would’ve never given him up you hear me Never You
understand I would’ve never given him up to anyone

She lunges at BORIS fists raised and starts pummeling him on the chest
shoulders face He doesn’t defend himself Blood starts dripping from his nose
