DAVIS
Dexter you fucking peasant

The older WAITER appears and breaks Jack’s glare

JACK
Do you have egg beaters

WAITER

JACK
A glass of water then Thank you

The Waiter looks at Davis and suddenly he’s not hungry
The Waiter shakes his head and tends to his other
patrons Davis pulls out a cigarette

JACK
Don’t spark up in here People
are trying to enjoy their
breakfast

DAVIS

What do you want

JACK
What do I want Shut your mouth
and listen That’s what I want
(as Davis is silent)

All you Wall Street schmucks You
analyze numbers ‘til you’re blue
in the face but when it comes
down to betting aka thinking

with your money your common sense
is as scarce as your ethics

DAVIS
And what you do is ethical

JACK
If you’d ever hit one you’d think
I was ethical

The Waiter drops off a water Jack smiles in thanks

JACK
There are two reasons why you
should never bet on team sports
The players aren’t interested in
the spread and they’re not using
their money It’s that simple

DAVIS
Yes I grasp the concept

JACK

So why are you putting ten grand
on Miami when they’re playing in
Green Bay and it’s twenty below
Zero

(as Davis says

nothing)
I’m sorry that it got this
pathetic but you owe ninety-six
thousand --

DAVIS
I owe eighty-seven

JACK
You owe eighty-seven plus a ten
percent book fee I’m letting
that 49ers incident slide But
it’s time to act intelligent
Youve dealt with Dex he’s
allowed you to be fiscally
irresponsible it’s over

Davis laughs and gives a condescending shake of the head

Jack punches him hard in the face for this
from Davis’s nose It’s so crazy in the diner
however nobody notices a thing

painfully

JACK
It’s okay Ssshh You’ll be
fine

DAVIS
(softly whimpering)
You broke my fucking nose

JACK
It’s okay Ssshh You’1ll still
be able to trade

Blood rushes

Jack practically holds him up in the booth and hands him
Davis looks ready to faint as Jack whispers

napkins

JACK

Rich fathers set spoiled children

up with trusts They do this for

tax purposes Where do we go to

Davis looks down to his engraved DW briefcase Jack
kicks it across the floor Patrons look over as Jack
turns to ice

A shill is a bloke that casinos
bring in to keep high stake games
going strong You see casinos
want games to go on as long as
possible so they can grab a bigger
cut since there is no house They
especially loved Jack because he
used his own money

(after a long stare-off)
But then one day he got stupid
He marked an ace with a dirty
fingernail the cameras picked it
up and Jack got banned from
Nevada for life

Jack smiles and reflects on his past

JACK

Do you know what a ‘bookie’ is

Well the way it works is I have
an 800 number people can call if
they want to place a bet Rather
than using names they are
designated a personal code The
people then call message
recorders which are set up in an
empty apartment and the person
leaves a message saying their
code who they want and for how
much My people retrieve the
messages and I bankroll it
Pretty simple

JACK
Yes we’ve already been through
that Look my only crime is
firing a shotgun to protect my
family

SIMPKINS
Why did you go to Jeremy Kinnear’s
house yesterday

Jack is silent After a long beat --

SIMPKINS
I think we’re in agreement that
the circumstances surrounding your
brother’s death were unusual
but --

JACK
-- Unusual

In any case it’s our job to worry
about it Not yours

And from where I’m standing you
need to start looking out for
number one

Simpkins lifts a file folder

SIMPKINS

FBI faxed over the dirty on you
Pretty extensive investigation
they got going

You’re smart Jack I’ll give you
that But the feds they’re
patient And patience always
prevails against the ‘career

criminal’ Federal prosecutors
win 97 percent of their cases
(MORE)

SIMPKINS (CONT’D)
Why Patience They don’t go
into a courtroom half-cocked like
Marcia Clark When you lose --

VOORHEES
(quickly interjecting)
And you will

SIMPKINS
youll be sent to a federal
prison like Marion or Lewisberg
and do 85 percent of a federal
sentence That’s mandatory

VOORHEES
Big Brother doesn’t risk taxpayer
money on your recidivist ass

SIMPKINS
No appeal No time for good
behavior Life as you know it
will end that day

Knowing he’s not getting much more from this particular
inquiry Simpkins shuts off the cassette recorder

SIMPKINS

Can I offer some real advice Not
as a cop but as a husband and a
father

(as Jack nods)
You’ve got a lot to lose
Whatever you’re thinking do
yourself a favor and don’t

JACK
That’s your impression of advice

SIMPKINS

The attempt on your life signifies
you’re poking a sleeping bear
Doesn’t take a park ranger to know
that bear will eventually bite

I do they try to bang me off the
bat Tell their friends they
fucked a porn star But not your
brother He was sweet to me He
was real So when I found out how
young Doreen was and who she
was I couldn’t live with
myself

So you gave it to him

GERALDINE
I wanted to I was hoping
(exploding in tears)
I didn’t think he would go to the
cops

JACK
What did you think That he’d
watch his daughter get raped and
do nothing

GERALDINE
I don’t know what the hell I was
thinking Maybe I thought he
could save his daughter from
heading down the same path I did
I don’t know

might just save you the
humiliation

JEREMY
Come on Jack Put it down

JACK
You can’t go around recruiting
little girls Jeremy

JEREMY
I’m sorry it happened Jack But
I didn’t recruit anyone And once
I discovered her age I
immediately put a halt on it I
didn’t get to where I am by being

stupid

JACK
Emotionally physically
sexually she’1l never be the
same

JEREMY
Please Just put the gun away and
let’s talk about this As
gentleman

JACK
As gentlemen You killed my
brother

JEREMY
Hold on a second I didn’t kill
anyone

JACK
What does it matter if you
actually pulled the trigger or
not You had the most to lose
You might not have gotten your
hands dirty but you picked up the
bill

Jeremy’s feeling of total helplessness is obvious

JEREMY
It’s clear you’re going to be
pigheaded and not listen to
anything I have to say

JACK
Don’t need to As a poker player
you of all people know that
everything is in the eyes

Jack locks the office door and gestures to the corner

JACK
Get over there and face the wall

JEREMY
What can I do to convince you
Jack

JACK

You can do what I say

JEREMY
Fine
(moving to the corner)
You want me to put on a ‘dunce’
cap

JACK
No Just get down on your knees

JEREMY
Jack c’mon You’re not this
stupid
JACK

Get down on your knees
Jeremy drops to his knees and whines
JACK
Now I want you to picture
something Jeremy Visualize
since that’s what you’re best at

Jack stares at the back of Jeremy’s balding head

JACK
Imagine watching your little
girl your everything ona

computer screen On it you see
her drugged out of her mind
forced to engage in sex acts too
hideous to mention Now imagine
it being done by people you know
Your supposed friends who come
into your bar all the time And
you know they can kill you But

you don’t care So at the first
opportunity justice in your
guts --

JEREMY

-- drive to the cops rather than
listen to reason

JACK
Because there is no reason
There’s nothing to discuss
(softening)
Except when you stop at that red
light you feel this

Jack presses the gun muzzle to the back of Jeremy’s head
Jeremy starts to cry

OS -- The SCREAMS of Fire There’s a warning KNOCK on
the door but it quickly disappears
JACK
And there’s no mistaking what it
is what’s going to happen You

know in the pit of your stomach
you are going to die
(MORE)

JACK (CONT’D)
And that you have failed to defend
the person who needed you most
Can you imagine having that
feeling

JEREMY
Jack please I beg you

JACK
Too late Jeremy

JEREMY
I’ll give you everything I have
JACK
It would never be enough Time to
die motherfucker
