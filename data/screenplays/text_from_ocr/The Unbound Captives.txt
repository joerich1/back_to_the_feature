TEXAS - 1859 CLEAR FORK OF BRAZOS RIVER

EXT PRAIRIE - TWILIGHT

Embers from a campfire shooting crackling up into the night
sky Through the flames the vague sight of arms legs
twisting dancing Sounds of CHANTING HUMMING rising louder
Silence

TOM’S VOICE
What can you ask of fate

TOM DEARBORN is lying on a bedroll staring into the flames
Alone

EXT COTTONWOOD GROVE NIGHT

A boy of 10 PHINEAS CONNER slowly stalks a wild turkey He
stops looks down at the ground pulls from the earth--

A HALF BURIED MOCCASIN Small slivers of tin attached to it
JINGLE He hold it fascinated

TOM’S VOICE (CONTD)
It is an enchantment It opens its
door and we happen through

INT LOG CABIN - NIGHT

May sits at the edge of a bed with her daughter RACHEL 6
whos HUMMING A SOFT TUNE A small collection of
handcrafted dolls sitting beside them Together they
delicately work on making another sewing on a button for an
eye The image ghostly Beautiful perfection to the moment

EXT PRAIRIE - NIGHT

BACK TO TOM - Arm resting over his head Far away SOUNDS
of quiet CHIMES

EXT PLAINS DAY

A POCKET WATCH - Gold chain attached rests on an animal
skin It’s open CHIMES exquisitely

BUFFALO HUMP WAR CHIEF OF THE PENATEKA COMANCHES regards it
His presence is formidable impenetrable

ROBERT NEIGHBORS the US Indian Agent quiet
articulate and TOM DEARBORN his Translator sit across from
the Comanche waiting for a reaction There is none
BUFFALO HUMP
(smiles in Comanche)
Yes Ive seen this before but
never one that sings--It tells the
white man when to do things

Tom TRANSLATES

NEIGHBORS
(enjoying this)
Unfortunately that’s trueOur
chief wishes to show his respect
for you

BUFFALO HUMP
Which one--The Texan or the
American

NEIGHBORS
The Great One--In Washington

BUFFALO HUMP
I do not know this man yet he asks
me to go far away and live in a
place I’ve never seenThis is my
home

NEIGHBORS
Please hear me sir Half your
people have agreed to go White
Bear and the others will come to
speak peace with us We have
guaranteed their safety Join them
and you will be many You’ll be
strong again

BUFFALO HUMP
We are strong now Only War Chiefs
Speak peace
(smiles)
You can talk of other things Those
who made the Texan’s peace are now
this--

He picks up a handful of dirt the dust runs through his
fingers to the ground

BUFFALO HUMP (CONTD)
Tell your Great Chief we are not
children sitting at the Whiteman’s
feet waiting for whatever he
chooses to give us
NEIGHBORS
Yes I understand I will tell
him---but there is no more time

NEIGHBORS (CONT’D)

(hesitates to Tom)
Im at a loss

(to Buffalo Hump)
At night when you look to the
stars--That’s how many warriors the
white man has And they are
coming

Tom hesitates

NEIGHBORS (CONT’D)
Tell him Tom

Tom TRANSLATES Buffalo Hump watches him

NEIGHBORS (CONT’‘D)
Your people will suffer all the
more The Texans will see to that

BUFFALO HUMP
(coolly)
Will they

NEIGHBORS
Yes my friend I’m afraid so

BUFFALO HUMP
Dont be afraid

He folds the corners of the animal skin over the watch
unwilling to touch it

BUFFALO HUMP (CONTD)
See me now--I wear nothing of the
White Man and I wont carry his
magic

He politely pushes it to Neighbors with his pony whip

BUFFALO HUMP (CONT’D)

The Whites have wondrous things
but they dont have this--

(he gestures across the

vast landscape)
It is oursWe are the People We
are here we will always be here

(beat)
Tell all your Chiefs---I will never
go in

He waits a moment for the translation suddenly addresses Tom-

BUFFALO HUMP (CONT’D)
This is for your ears--I had a
dream of you You held a long
knife and you couldn’t see through
the air

TOM
(amused)
Did it end well

BUFFALO HUMP
It did not end at all

Neighbors watches the men then persistently--

NEIGHBORS
We must meet again--

Buffalo Hump holds up his hand interrupting

BUFFALO HUMP
(to Neighbors)
I have no quarrel with you Your
heart is good I have no more
words

Buffalo Hump stands They all rise Neighbors extends his
hand The Chief shakes it

NEIGHBORS
I wish you well

The Chief turns his back to them mounts his horse gives a
last glance back

TOM and NEIGHBORS watch him ride away
EXT DAY - LONELY OUTPOST

APPLAUSE A young INDIAN BOY sets another arrow in his bow
A MAN in a worn black suit pitches a second coin into the
air the boy hits it again hardly seeming to aim White
onlookers APPLAUD INDIAN SQUAWS in their most colorful
costumes ululate

REVEAL an outpost with a courtyard Several Comanche
families and a group of a twenty or so curious whites trying
to communicate through halting sign language The mood is

A DUSTY EXHAUSTED RIDER strides in goes to Neighbors hands
him a letter Neighbor reddens as he reads Tom clocks

(clenched jaw low-to Tom)
Apparently the Magistrate and his
“committee’ have chosen not to

The man is incoherent BLOOD SPURTING from his neck Tom
clamps his hand over the man’s surging wound staunching the
blood flow

TOM (CONTD)
(furious)
WHO ARE YOU WHO SENT YOU HERE

No response
TOM (CONTD)
(to the Assassin)
Who are you

The man just stares in his eyes defiantly doesn’t answer

TOM mercilessly releases his hand from the man’s wound
blood gushing leaving him to die He rises to his feet

BLACK SCREEN

EXT FORT -—- ESTABLISH - DAY

A fort in name only built by settlers Some live
permanently others move in during more volatile times
There are eight or nine log structures surrounded by a fence
of no more than eight feet high round pickets There’s a
trading postgeneral store Men work the fields outside the
fort We see a GROWING CROWD in the background RIDERS
coming from all parts

INT CONNOR GENERAL STORE - DAY

Tom slips in through the back door His face gaunt eyes
weary staring hollowly He’s worn and wary--scans the room
guardedly Dusty from a long journey

TOMS POV - A woman MAY dusting shelves

TOM - moves toward the counter never taking his eyes off the
door and window He looks back at May and in his
exhaustion depletion gazes at her for several moments - at
her freshness Far removed from all he’s seen

She looks up startled at his appearance then smiles He
averts his gaze looks down at the candy counterFinally--

MAY
May I help you

TOM
YesI’d like two plugs of
Niggerhead if you please

She hands him some chew SOUND of someone running on the
duckboards outside the store

TOM - jerks his head back toward the door lightly drops his
hand to his sidearm Vigilant Waiting May looks at his
wrist

MAY’S POV - Flecks of blood on Toms shirt cuff and hand

May almost says something looks at his face Waits He’s
still watching the door She holds back
ll

MAY
Something else

TOM

NoWell yes Maybe some of that
candy

May picks some peppermint starts rolling it in brown paper
Tom watches May her gentleness her presence washes over

him A dissonance from the nightmare of the day before Then
for little reason at all--

TOM (CONTD)

(points here and there)
Id like some of those and a few of
theseAnd these here look good

MAY
That will be ten cents Anything
else sir

He looks back ‘round Spies a linen handkerchief laying on
the counter It’s clearly monogramed--MH

TOM

MAY

That’s mine It’s not for sale
TOM

My apologies Is it Martha Mary
MAY

May
TOM

May

He gazes at her for an instant then looks down at the
fabric As if in two places at once Unable to reach out

MAY
The “H” is for Halliwell my maiden
name But now I’m a Conner My in-
laws own this store

A flicker of disappointment on Tom’s face May sees it for a
split second Senses his aloneness and that he’s somehow
freighted maybe wrecked She starts to ask for his well
being then stops herself sees he’s shut off

MAY (CONT’D)
But here we have a new one Will
this do

TOM
Yes M’am Thank you

MAY
We’re up to a dollar and ten cents

Tom fumbles for coins in his vest pocket Can’t seem to reach
them

MAY (CONT’D)
Sir are you---

Their eyes meet Something in his look his guardedness
makes her drop the question

Tom just holds out the money

She finishes wrapping his purchases Theyre both silent a
little awkward She hands them to Tom

TOM
Thank you Mam

She nods The back door OPENS Tom defensively reaches his
hand beneath his coat Robert Neighbors walks in showing
the effects of a hard ride He looks at Tom glances at May

NEIGHBORS

I was afraid you might have become
lost or met with foul play

TOM
Not yet Here’s your chaw

CLINTON CONNER followed by his wife LORENA both in their
sixties enter from the back of the store carrying two huge
jugs We HEAR A CROWD outside GROWING LOUDER

counter

Indians or Whites who can say

tosses him back the papers turns away toward the bar

BAYLOR
What are you suggesting Bob

NEIGHBORS

compensate these men with the
cattle you and your boys stole from
the Comanche Reservation

BAYLOR
GODDAMN YoU

In a flash they’re at each other each grabbing the other’s
lapels Tom JOINING Neighbors It all happens fast The only
thing keeping them from tearing each other to pieces is the
big struggling knot of men pulling them apart

NEIGHBORS
NO GODDAMN YOU Are you four men

the post on Big Sister Creek--
(to everyone)
That was a Peace Council You
murderous swine--

BAYLOR

The man hands Tom his gun Lorena passes Clinton a shotgun

CLINTON
Allright--Allright Boys Try to
respect the rules of the house

The men un-ruffle cool off disperse just a bit Neighbors
returns to his drink as Baylor moves toward his men

ON MAY as she watches showing neither shock nor fear
Lorena is nervous

Neighbors finishes his drink sets it down and nods to Tom
ready to leave He passes close to Baylor pauses a moment
to look him in the face and in a LOW VOICE

NEIGHBORS
Youve already won

He and Tom go to the door There’s a hostile BUZZ in the
room

May notices Tom’s paper-wrapped packages on the counter She
picks them up and in front of his adversaries

MAY
Sir

Stopping him She gracefully navigates the hostile room
right over to Tom

MAY (CONTD)
These are yours

Tom looks gently at her and rather than say anything simply
tips his hat with respect and just a tinge of regret Leaves

Deeper till there’s no bottom under its hooves

The horse starts swimming They go just a bit farther out
but the rapids prove too strong and Tom and his struggling
horse are pulled downstream They tumble through the water
He makes no move to save himself

The dance ends MUSIC changes to a WALTZ Tom takes May’s
hand leads her to the dance floor As they waltz they’re
passed by other couples some of whom dart glances at May
Tom pretends to take no notice

(warmed by his
thoughtfulness )
Perhaps the both of us then

unable to Her gloved hand lays in his He turns her palm
over Tom starts to say something then stops May looks
down at his hand in her own A TATTOO is barely covered by
the cuff of his sleeve She lightly pushes the sleeve back
stares at the strange symbols encircling his wrist May
looks up at Tom startled

TOM (CONTD)
I was taken as a boy I lived nine
years with the Comanche---There’s
no shame in it May

May can’t speak She looks away

want to turn you away

moment then accepts his answer as truth Quiet She moves

to an old trunk kneels before it Opens it

Tts filled with her children’s belongings They give May
comfort And without self-pity without bitterness she
looks at the objects He kneels next to her as she gently

touches her past

MAY
My acquaintances don’t ask me about
them anymore--They’ve always held
this quiet expectation that my
grief should fade and that I would
bury my childrenBut it’s
unnatural isn’t it

She stops almost embarrassed Her face is flushed
hands tremble Tom just listens

MAY (CONT‘D)

I feel them as if they’re right
here in this room As if they’ve
never left meHow can I put that
in a grave

Tom puts his hand over hers Gently looks at her

TOM

(can’t finish beat)
You should have left me there that
day

TOM
It would have been to my
everlasting regret if I had

her

quiet Finally

TOM (CONTD)
Marry me Be my wife

May looks up at him at the desire on his face

TOM (CONTD)
May-I want a life with you No
one else Only you

A long silence

May regards him a moment then rises and slowly walks to the
other side of the room With her back to him she unbuttons
the bodice of her dress dropping it down her back Her skin
amass of scars

magic strong See him there--He
won’t be vanquished

TOMS VOICE
He gave me a pony--—

MUKEWARRAH - Holding Tom’s wrists pressing his palms on the
horse’s neck leaving two palm-prints

buckskin horseThat a buckskin
horse would bring me good medicine

May is livid Nearly hysterical Moves on Cox Tom pulls
her back

MAY
Don’t you talk that way Don’t you
say that Someone still loves
these children--They belong
somewhere

Tom turns May into him She buries her face in his shoulder
He quietly turns her around and moves her through the crowd
As they pass--

at him Tom sidesteps delivers a blistering blow to the
teamster’s throat dropping him to his knees

Tom KICKS Cox in the face The man falls on his side
GASPING for breath blood coming from his ear Tom crouches
beside him speaks in a low tone

TOM

Her eyes are downcast as she grapples with what he’s told
her Finally--

MAY
They cast you out---

TOM

She shakes her head Uncomprehending Then bitterly--

MAY
And still you have feeling for
them

TOM

Yes I always will

MAY
You weren’t there to see what they

Quiet for a long drawn out moment May’s shaking with shock
and fury--

MAY (CONT’D)
Why are you with me Tom

TOM
Id ask you the same but I know
the answer
She SLAPS him hard Tom takes the blow
MAY
Do you pity me Or are you doing
penance for your past sins

dirty skin dark from years of being in the sun but an

unmistakable version of May at a younger age She holds a
young BABY in her arms May rises Tom watches her

She can’t take her eyes off RACHEL May’s expression wears
the pain and wonder and awareness of all the years she’s
missed

Rachel doesn’t make eye contact with May She’s skittish
Frightened Doesn’t know what’s going to happen to her She
looks at the Chief

attention of a Cavalry SOLDIER who bears down onhim saber
outstretched Tom SHOUTS to May--

TOM (CONT’D)
Don’t stop

He’s now engaged in battle He drops his horse back to cut
off the Soldier The American swings at Tom narrowly
missing him

TOM (CONTD)
Let us alone——

The Soldier pays no heed He’s raging strikes at Tom Tom
raises his pistol to fire

The Soldier deflects the pistol with his sword causing the
shot to go wild Tom loses his pistol Draws his knife

The Soldier strikes at him again narrowly missing Tom
embedding the saber in his saddle

Tom THRUSTS his knife under the soldier’s ribs DUST and
CONFUSION reign He looks about for May--can’t find her

A TONKAWA SCOUT in Cavalry uniform jumps on Tom’s horse
cuts a slight gash in Tom’s neck They struggle

Buffalo Hump rides in quickly SLAMS his war club against the
Tonkawa’s back TOPPLING him from Tom’s saddle

BUFFALO HUMP (COMANCHE)
This way

Tom hunkers over his horse’s neck rides after Buffalo Hump
EXT CREEK

May is nearing the water She’s not alone There must be
more than thirty Kwahadi SQUAWS some carrying children
fording the water Theyre panicked many cry howl

May pulls her horse up looks about her SCREAMING for Rachel

A YOUNG WOMAN turns to face her It’s Rachel She’s waist
deep in the waterholding her infant struggling to get to
the other side Fearful of her mother

May instinctively jumps off her horse and wades in after
Rachel leaving her mount at the Riverbank A GREY-HAIRED
SQUAW turns on May She’s cutting herself with a knife over
and over in mourning She points the knife toward May

SQUAW (COMANCHE)
You brought them here

May is uncomprehending Keeps moving after her daughter A
volley of GUNFIRE Squaws and their children fall into the
water bleeding dying

A HANDFUL OF SOLDIERS stand on the opposite bank firing at
their targets relentlessly They’re sole purpose is
extermination

Rachel is in shock Doesn’t know where to turn In the
melee May manages to pull Rachel and Owl in a cutaway
beneath the riverbank

SMOKE and GUNFIRE SCREAMING CRYING May and Rachel hidden
from view heads barely above water witness the massacre

THE SOLDIERS - They systematically reload fire kill their
prey They’re skilled Unemotional

MAY RACHEL OWL - May’s hand is clamped over her daughter’s
mouth holding her fast keeping her from joining the others
Their heads are barely above the water Rachel struggles to
hold her baby up high

THEIR POV - A SQUAW horribly wounded Bleeding profusely
her last moments alive She’s holding her very young CHILD
looking at him closely Then she lowers him beneath the
water drowning her son She looks at Rachel

SQUAW (COMANCHE) (CONTD)
This is the better way

The Baby disappears The Squaw’s head falls into the water
her body floats after her child’s

May looks at Rachel sickened terrified that her daughter
will do the same The SHOOTING continues May shakes her
head ‘no’ pleading Rachel struggles to hold Owls head
above the water May helps her

Rachel stares at the horrible Starts weeping Can’t harm
her child She chooses to stay alive

GUNSHOTS STOP SILENCE but for the battle raging in the
village its fury beginning to fade DEAD women and children
litter the water

A BOY of 8 has survived He struggles to pull his wounded
body up the bank of the river A SOLDIER stands watching
the boy’s efforts He pulls a canteen to his own mouth
Mops his sweaty head

SOLDIER
Its hotter than a biscuit out here-

Then without warning and with no reaction he puts a bullet
through the boy’s head

ON MAY AND RACHEL - They STARTLE at the gunshot They can’t
see anything from their hiding place

TOM AND BUFFALO HUMP ride up on the opposite side of the
river In a moment of complete surprise the Soldiers and Tom
and Buffalo Hump FIRE at each other

MAY AND RACHEL unseen by Tom watch May is unable to call
out to him

Tom desperately looks about for May then he and Buffalo Hump
turn and ride downstream The Soldiers and enemy Indians
LEAP over May and Rachel’s a hiding place CHASE the men

MAY AND RACHEL hold still until the enemy are out of sight
Theyre the sole survivors of the massacre May pulls her
daughter and grandchild through the dead bodies and blood
toward the bank of the river

Rachel scrambles up the bank gasping tries to move off in
no particular direction May grabs her arms

MAY
No--noupstream

Rachel backs away from her

Rachel--darling please This way
She points upstream and pulls her there Rachel submits
EXT GRASSY RIVERBANK

with their horses They pull their steeds up to their feet

from where the battle has moved May stops short

MAY‘S POV - TOM’S BUCKSKIN HORSE bleeding A SOLDIER holds
the horse’s reins in a death grip He’s sitting up scalped
appears to be looking at the women

Sandy’s ears are pinned back frightened May moves forward
tries to reach for the reins tries to calm the terrified
horse

MAY
Whoa boywho--

The horse starts to pull frantically The reins slip from
the dead soldier’s hands

MAY (CONTD)
Easy-Easy--God please Sandy--

The horse eases up steadies May grasps the reins Sandy
gives a final head jolt then stands still

EXT BRUSHY AREA

He carries one of his wounded brothers

The old warrior is pained Goes to the barely conscious
brave looks over his wounds

TOM (COMANCHE )

As the men help the wounded WE SEE behind them in the
distance TWO FIGURES and a HORSE ascending a hill Tom
reflexively turns around sees them Hes off in a flash

EXT HILL - DAY

The men have joined Tom the SOUNDS OF BATTLE receding in the
distance They ride hard to catch up to the figures

TOP OF THE HILL - May Rachel and Owl They’ve been
following the path of KAWAHADI WOMEN CHILDREN AND OLD MEN
about a mile ahead of them

May hears the noise of horses behind her She turns
dismounts gun outstretched Her hand shakes uncontrollably
She’s exhausted

Tom ascends the hill overwhelmed

TOM
May-

Disbelief on her face She falls into his arms notices his
wounds She starts tearing strips of cloth off her skirt to
wrap the bloodied cuts

Tom looks to Rachel smiles faintly She nods turns looks
in the opposite direction

Buffalo Hump moves to her follows her gaze

THEIR POV - The escaping Comanches undetected making their
way west far from their burning village

RED FEATHER (0C)

They all turn to see FIFTEEN SOLDIERS slowly advancing toward
the hill They’re not stopping

Tom and Buffalo Hump look toward the emigrating squaws May
stands near Rachel trying to comprehend tense

MAYS POV - Buffalo Hump speaking to his Braves They shake
their heads in dissent The Braves remove their moccasins
symbolically lay them on the ground No retreat

Tom says something to Buffalo Hump He looks to May and
Rachel then nods walks over to them

TOM
Buffalo Hump will lead you and the
Kwahadi away from here I want the
three of you to follow him We’1l
hold back the charge

May looks to her daughter and then to Buffalo Hump
Unnerved she walks close to Tom looks at him

MAY
Youre staying

Tom looks to the Braves then back at May

TOM
Were staying

Mays gaze falls to the ground a moment With difficulty
she tries to accept what he’s doing for her for the others
Her eyes rest on him Tom gazes back at her Then she tugs
at his hand leading him to Rachel

MAY
(to Rachel urgently)
T love you Tell her Tom

Tom translates as

MAY (CONTD)
I always have
(she presses her palm to
her chest)
(MORE)

MAY (CONTD)
HereHereYou’ve always lived
here You’ve never left and you
never will

She places her hands on Rachel The girl remains neutral
May holds her arms out for the baby Rachel puts the child
in her mother’s arms

MAY (CONT’D)
She is you I’ve never forgotten

She kisses Owls forehead hands her back to Rachel and in
so doing lets go of her daughter forever She looks at
Rachel on last time Hands her the horse’s reins

ON TOM - He knows May has chosen to remain on the hill with
him

TOM
May you can’t stay theres
nothing in that--

MAY
(interrupting)
Tell her goodbye Tom

Tom scrutinizes her face She’s determined Her time left
is with him now

He does as he’s asked

Buffalo Hump speaks to his Braves They embrace A last
farewell They help the wounded Comanche onto his horse

The SOLDIERS advance up the hill Time running out

Buffalo Hump approaches Tom and May He hands her a knife
Tom translates

BUFFALO HUMP
For your enemies
(to Tom)
Remember everything When we meet
in the ‘other place’ we will talk

Buffalo Hump and Rachel ride off Tom and the braves take
their positions ready to fight The Comanches begin SINGING
THEIR DEATH SONGS Tom reloads his rifle sights it in A
BUGLE BLOWS

May watches her daughter gallop off behind Buffalo Hump
Disappearing one more time Suddenly Rachel turns in the
saddle stops her horse CALLS out to MAY HALTINGLY--

RACHEL (ENGLISH)
Goodbye my first mother--

Her words bring May a happiness she could not expect She
stands rooted to the spot getting a last glimpse of Rachel
as the girl moves away in the distance JOINING the long
trail of KWAHADI

Tom and the Braves ready for the onslaught May takes her
place next to Tom Waiting The men sing LOUDER Make no
effort to hide themselves not to flee

May sits back to bake with Tom He FIRES his gun drops a
soldier then another

The soldiers RUN up at them

May turns her head to Tom’s back doesn’t take her eyes off
him A radiance fills her face

MAY

The light illuminates the back of an LITTLE GIRL her head
turned up to the sun filtering through a window she holds
two small lead Indian figures to the light She SPEAKS in

away A shadow of a smile on her face

MAY’S POV - RACHEL AND OWL Her daughter looking directly at
her warm Dust whirls round them as they move forward until
theyre gradually obscured once more leaving only--

A DUST DEVIL - In their place Whirling growing larger
Spinning ‘round and ‘round as the wind moans

ON MAY — Looking down at Theodora touching her hair They
stand mesmerized by the spinning wonder

MAY looks up at Tom a smile spreads across her face

humming a song maybe Indian barely audible OVER --

THE DUST DEVIL Gathering force whipping around in no
particular direction Golden impenetrable
