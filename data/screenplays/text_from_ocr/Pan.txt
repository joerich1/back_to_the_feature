OUT OF THE BLACKNESS SLOWLY EMERGES--—

The incandescent twinkle of STARS in the night sky Maybe our
eyes are playing tricks on us but for a second it almost
seems that one star FLARES brighter than all the others--

The second star to the right

Suddenly-- KVWOOSH The image SPLASHES AWAY as a WOMAN’S BOOT
stomps through it and we realize we were looking at the sky
reflected in a puddle of water We rapidly TILT UP to see

MARY in a long hooded raincoat sprinting away from us
into--

EXT CENTRAL LONDON - NIGHT
Rain falls The London skyline looms large on the horizon

We TRACK the woman as she races through the eerily quiet
city We don’t know who she is we don’t know what she’s
running from but one thing is clear -- she’s running for her
life

cU -- on a sign that reads KENSINGTON GARDENS

Our woman races past it After a beat-- a SECOND FIGURE
draped in shadows quickly follows

INT KENSINGTON GARDENS - MOMENTS LATER

WIDE ON-- a BRIDGE overlooking a lake In the starlight we
see the woman in silhouette as she races full speed across

PUSH IN ON THE WOMAN-- as she begins to slow coming to a
stop in the middle of the bridge We get a good look at her
face for the first time -- fiercely beautiful with piercing
blue eyes

Breathlessly she checks her watch ounen eyes Big Ben in the
distance as its massive arms tick to--

MAN (0S)
Midnight

A MAN ruggedly handsome approaches

MAN (CONT’D)
They did say you’d be prompt

MARY
Mr Dobkins

DOBKINS
(nods)
We should move quickly Miss Mary
We don’t have time You do have it -
- don’t you
Fuchs 10913 2

Mary nods and begins to open her coat snap by snap Dobkin’s
eyes WIDEN as if she’s about to unveil the Ho y Grail when--

GUNMAN (0S)
DONT

pheyp both turn to see-- A BEARDED GUNMAN WITH A REVOLVER
ED IN A FLASH DOBKINS HAS PULLED A FLINTLOCK PISTOL
MARY RAPIDLY PULLS A GUN OF HER OWN

We’re in a Mexican stand-off on the bridge as the two men
begin to circle around Mary

GUNMAN (CONTD)
Don’t give it to him Mary

MARY
Who are you

GUNMAN
I’m Dobkins

Mary levels her gun at the first man

DOBKINS 1
Don’t believe him He’s lying

Mary sizes the situation up One wrong move they’re all
dead She levels her gun at the second man

MARY
What I carry will change
everything You know that Swear to
me you are who you say you are

DOBKINS 2
I swear it Miss I swear it

She levels the gun back at Dobkins 1

DOBKINS 1
He’s a liar Mary I’m Dobkins

Mary can’t read which one is lying She alternates her aim
between men as they circle

DOBKINS 1 (CONT’D)
I swear on my mother’s life
MARY
What did you say

DOBKINS 1
I said I swear on my mother’s life

She eyes Dobkins 2 then-- SWINGS THE GUN BACK TOWARD DOBKINS
1 AND -- BAM -- PULLS THE TRIGGER SENDING HIM OVER THE EDGE
INTO THE LAKE

SFX -- a baby beginning to cry
Fuchs 10913 3

Mary joins the real Dobkins begins to unsnap her raincoat

DOBKINS
How did you know it was me

MARY
Because where we come from

She opens her jacket to reveal a crying NEWBORN BOY with
PIERCING BLUE EYES securely fastened into a wraparound sling

MARY (CONT’D)
No one has a mother
(then)
Let’s go

EXT CENTRAL LONDON - MOMENTS LATER

Mary and Dobkins hurry down the street

MARY
He knew where to find me -- how

DOBKINS
Spies everywhere Miss Mary These
are dark times They want your boy
(then points)
This way

EXT CHURCH - NIGHT

CU -- a sign reads KENSINGTON CHURCH and HOME FOR BOYS

Mary and Dobkins arrive at the steps of the church Dobkins
rings the doorbell

DOBKINS
He’ll be safe here Miss You have
my word

Mary takes off the sling wrapping the boy in her raincoat
She sets her baby down gently at the foot of the church door
She SLIPS a note in the coat pocket then takes off her
NECKLACE draping it around the boy’s neck

We HEAR the noises of PEOPLE awakened by the doorbell

DOBKINS (CONTD)
We have to leave now Mary Come

ON MARYS AGONIZED FACE-- as she gently kisses the boy’s
forehead tears rolling down her cheeks

MARY
I love you my son I love you--

ON THE BOY-- as Mary whispers
Fuchs 10913 4
MARY (CONT’D) (0S)
My Peter

We PUSH IN on the face of PETER and then IN ON his mother’s
necklace resting on his chest from which we now see hangs--

A SMALL BUT ICONIC WOODEN PAN PIPE

The music SWELLS drowning out the baby’s cries as everything
but the PIPE fades to black

ANGLE ON THE PIPE asit ROTATES vertically and then tilts out
TOWARD us horizontally to reveal that from this perspective
the series of wooden tubes spell out our TITLE CARD

PAN
The letters FLARE -- not unlike that special star in our
first shot -- temporarily blinding us until we--
FADE IN
CU -- eyes closed shut
BOY (0S)

PETER
The eyes SNAP open to reveal a pair of immediately
recognizable blue eyes Reveal
INT KENSINGTON HOME FOR BOYS - NIGHT
An orphanage dormitory that feels straight out of Dickens

PETER scrawny but a heartbreaker even if he doesn’t
know it yet sits up to see his best friend NIBS visibly malnourished standing at the foot of his bed

NIBS
C’mon You’re going to miss
breakfast
Peter nods kicking off the sheets
ANGLE ON PETER’S NECKLACE-- as he tucks the pan pipe inside
his shirt

INT CAFETERIA - DAY

ON AN EMPTY BOWL-- as a spoonful of gelatinous grey SLOP
SLAPS into it

Peter looks down at the bowl disgusted

WARWICK
Keep it moving then
Fuchs 10913 5

A rotund orphanage worker WARWICK clad in an apron
GLARES at Peter Peter GLARES back then moves on as we pull
WIDE to see

Peter in line with dozens of other borderline-starving BOYS
as they queue to get their morning cup of gruel

Text London 14 years later November 1940

ON A BALCONY ABOVE-- we see the cruel-faced FATHER PRATCHETT watching over this sorry scene without a hint of
empathy

ON PETER and NIBS-- as they walk toward one of a series of long
communal tables

PETER
These are barely left-overs How
much you wantto bet Pratchett up
there is stealing rations

NIBS
Shh If he hears you-

PETER
Shh yourself He doesn’t scare me

They find their seats-
NIB
Oi did you hear Nelson and Winny
both got adopted Lucky buggers
PETER
Both of them When

NIBS
Don’t know When I woke up they
was gone Adopted

PETER
In the middle of the night Doesn’t
that seem a touch odd to you

Nibs shrugs Peter eyes Pratchett above

INT WORK FLOOR - DAY

We MOVE DOWN a row of young ORPHANS all hard at work
recovering fibers from old shipping’ rope by hand until we
land on Peter and Nibs

ETER
If pratchett is stealing food
where do you suppose he’s hiding
it

NIBS
His office I guess that’d be the
place You reckon
Fuchs 10913 6

Nibs sees Peter’s face realizes what’s up

NIBS (CONTD)
Peter no I know that look

INT CHIMNEY - DAY
Peter and Nibs covered in soot sweep the chimney

NIBS
Even assuming Pratchett is hiding
the rations in his office what are
we supposed to do about it

PETER
We wait for an opportunity Then we
make our move

Peter smiles when-- Warwick pokes his head into the chimney
WARWICK
Less talk I need one of you up on
the roof cleaning the shutters
Peter looks to Nibs
PETER
Do you mind You know how I am with
heights
Nibs nods but before he leaves Peter grabs his arm

PETER (CONTD)
Be ready

INT CAFETERIA - DINNER TIME

Peter and Nibs sit with the other orphans eating slop when we
hear-- the CLATTER of a bowl hitting the floor

ON ONE PAINFULLY SKINNY ORPHAN-- who looks down to his spilt
bowl on the floor then looks up terrified as Father
Pratchett storms toward him

SKINNY ORPHAN
It was an accident I swear it

FATHER PRATCHETT
We give you this food while
children starve in the streets and
you spill it on the floor like so
much rubbish

The kid is so nervous he trembles

ON PETER-- angered by what he’s seeing
Fuchs 10913 7

SKINNY ORPHAN
Please I’m so hungry

SFX -- the CLATTER of ANOTHER BOWL hitting the floor

Pratchett’s head shoots up to see a spilt bowl on the floor
at the feet of a defiant looking Peter The whole room GASPS

PETER
It looks like I’1l be needing more
as well Father

As Pratchett approaches Nibs takes a deep breath and--
NIBS
Lord help me
then)
Oops
--knocks his bowl to the floor too spilling his gruel
FATHER PRATCHETT
What devil has possessed you
heathens
Another ORPHAN following Peter’s lead sspitis” his dinner
to the floor followed by another and anotherand
another
Pratchett spins around now engulfed by a sea of spilt bowls
ETER
(pounds on the table)
MoremoremoreMORE
Soon the entire room is spilling bowls and chanting with him
Peter grins ear to ear having the time of his life as
Pratchett CHASES him in between the TABLES but can’t catch
up slip-sliding on the spilt slop as the kids keep chanting
Warwick steps in front of Peter ready to grab him-

But Peter simply SLIDES on the slick floor in between
Warwick’s splayed legs emerging just as--

SFX -- an AIR-RAID SIREN wails in the not so distance

The party stops Everyone looks frightened and begins to file
out the front door

WARWICK
You hear the siren Not a drill
Everybody let’s go GO
ON NIBS-- as he begins to follow the others Peter GRABS him

PETER
Opportunity knocks
Fuchs 10913 8

EXT KENSINGTON HOME FOR BOYS - MOMENTS LATER

CU -- the headline of the Daily Express reads “Battle of
Britain Royal Airforce Patrols the Skies” We PULL OUT from
the newspaper box to reveal

The ORPHANS are being evacuated to an underground bomb
shelter down the street

Pratchett counts the orphans as they file out

FATHER PRATCHETT
Keep it moving 4748forty ni-

Pratchett stops roughly grabs the Skinny Orphan by the arm

FATHER PRATCHETT (CONT D)
Where’s the rest of your bunk

SKINNY ORPHAN
I dunno Father Honest

Every muscle in Pratchett’s face contracts into a scowl

FATHER PRATCHETT
Peter

INT HALLWAYS (KENSINGTON HOME FOR BOYS) - SAME TIME

ON PETER’S DETERMINED FACE-- as he sneaks down the hall with
Nibs in tow

NIBS
Doesn’t this seem a bit dangerous

PETER
What’s the fun of it without a
little danger Besides Pratchett
wont be back with everyone until
those sirens stop and that won’t
happen for at least another six
hours

We hear a RUMBLE from above as Nibs looks out the window to
see a PAIR OF BRITISH SUPERMARINE SPITFIRE FIGHTERS
streaking across the night sky

INT PRATCHETT’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

It’s a live-in office space The door CREAKS open as Peter
and Nibs step inside

Peter’s eyes dart around when- something catches his eye

ANGLE ON A BOOKCASE-- Peter approaches
Fuchs 10913 9

PETER
You ever see Pratchett actually
read a book

He blows on the spines and a puff of dust comes up

NIBS
Hasn’t touched those in a while
has he

PETER
Then why’s this one look brand new

CU -- a thick spined book that indeed has no dust on it

Peter pulls the book off the shelf and-- KVOOSH A SECRET
COMPARTMENT OPENS AT THEIR FEET to reveal

CRATES STAMPED “MINISTRY OF FOOD” BENEATH THE UNION JACK
WITHIN MOMENTS-- they’re rifling through one of the crates

NIBS
It’s enough to feed half of London

Nibs immediately starts chewing on a loaf of bread ravenous
when he’s distracted by something and stops drifting toward
the window

ON PETER-- as he takes another food ration out of the box and
then SUDDENLY he drops the food onto the floor staring into
the crate

Peter holds up a THICK STACK OF ENGLISH ONE POUND NOTES
Reveal beneath the food the crate is FILLED with cash

NIBS (CONTD)
Peter you said the sirens would
last at least six hours That no
one would be home til then Do you
hear that

A beat and then Peter’s face goes white as they both realize
simultaneously-- THE SIRENS HAVE STOPPED

PETER
Put it away We have to put it ALL
away Now now now

FRANTICALLY- they shove everything back in the compartment

INT HALLWAYS (KENSINGTON HOME) - SECONDS LATER
Peter and Nibs race down the hall as fast as they can

NIBS
Always six hours you said
Fuchs 10913

PETER
Well usually it’s six hours
Sometimes it’s faster

NIBS
Yeah And tonight

PETER
Faster

MOMENTS LATER-- Peter and Nibs race down the stairs

PETER (CONT’D
Don’t worry well blend in with
the rest of them as they come back
in Pratchett will never even know
we were gone

As -- BOOM --Peter runs DIRECTLY into--

FATHER PRATCHETT
Oh -- wont he

INT HALLWAY (KENSINGTON HOME) - NIGHT

Nibs sits nervously outside of Pratchetts office as
Warwick watches over him

INT PRATCHETT’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Pratchett sits behind his desk opposite Peter

FATHER PRATCHETT
Trouble has a habit of following
you doesn’t it Peter

PETER
Well they say everyone has a
talent sir

Pratchett smiles

FATHER PRATCHETT
You know what I think I think you
want me to punish you to tell you
again the worse you behave the
longer it will take to find you a
family for the same reason you
sabotage every adoption meeting --
because you don’t actually want to
leave this place

PETER
And why would I do that

Pratchett holds up the envelope Peter’s mother left him
Fuchs 10913 11

PETER (CONTD)
How did you get that My mother
left that for me give it back

FATHER PRATCHETT

We searched your bed found it
under your pillow

(opens the note)
“Dearest Peter Everything I have
done I have done because I love
you One day I will come back for
you and this will all make sense
Never give up on me -- or on
yourse

Pratchett folds the letter back up shaking his head

FATHER eee ee (CONT ’D)
Every orphan thinks theyre
special Peter They all have the
same childish fantasy they’1ll be
the one whose mother comes back for
them But the question you’re just
too afraid to ask yourself is
(he leans in)

Why hasnt she come back for you
And do you know the answer Peter
Because youre not different
you ‘re not special and she didn’t

eave you because She loved ou
She left you because she didn’

want you

He THROWS the letter at Peter who CLUTCHES it

FATHER PRATCHETT (CONT’D)
The sooner you grow up and realize
that the better

Pratchett opens his drawer and takes out- a blood-stained
wooden YARD STICK He sets it softly on the desk Peter
tenses

PETER
Is that how you’re going to
convince me then Your little
stick

FATHER PRATCHETT
Oh the stick isn’t for you
Warwick

Warwick appears at the door and SHOVES Nibs onto the office
floor He grabs Peter pulling him out of the room

FATHER PRATCHETT (CONT’D)
Poor Peter Forever condemned to
hurt the ones you love the most

Peter’s eyes WIDEN as the door begins to close
Fuchs 10913 12
PETER
No Nibs

We get a split second glimpse of Pratchett raising the stick
into the air before the door SLAMS shut

ON PETER-- shouting as Warwick restrains him

SFX -- the CRACKING sound of wood connecting with skin snaps
us to--

INT SHOWERS (KENSINGTON HOME) - MORNING

CRACK ON A TOWEL SNAPPING-- as orphans mess around

ON PETER-- grim faced as the water washes over him

INT DORMITORY (KENSINGTON HOME) - LATER

Peter walks through the boys’ dorm As he does notices
THREE EMPTY BEDS totally stripped He looks up to see RILEY a waif of an orphan passing by

PETER
Arnold and the twins -- why are
their beds stripped

RILEY
Oh yeah Pratchett told us this
morning Guess they was adopted
last night

ON PETER’S FACE-- as a chilling realization dawns

EXT RECESS YARD (KENSINGTON HOME) - DAY

Peter walks with purpose through the rear courtyard He looks
around until his eyes land-

ON NIBS-- sitting alone Peter strides toward him

PETER
I know you’re angry you deserve to
be -- I am SO sorry -- but you need

to listen to me right now

NIBS
I’m done listening to you

Nibs goes around him Peter keeps pace

PETER
Arnold and the twins are gone They
were “adopted” They went to bed
like the rest of us and in the
morning they were gone Just like
Nelson and Winny

(MORE)
Fuchs 10913 13

PETER (CONTD)
(then)
No one gets adopted at midnight
Nibs

NIBS
What are you saying

PETER
The money in Pratchett’s office We
couldn’t figure out how he got it
right What does he have that’s
worth anything

NIBS
I mean nothing All he’s got is--

PETER
Orphans He’s selling us Nibs

Nibs mind is racing as fast as Peter’s

NIBS
It couldnt bewho’d want us

PETER
I don’t know but we’re getting out
of here before we’re next

NIBS
What about your mum If you leave-

PETER

I’m qeaving one way or another but
if I’m sold to God knows who going
heaven knows where she’1ll never
find me

(determined)
I’m getting out of this place and
then I’m going to find her Now are
you with me or not

Nibs takes a deep breath
NIBS
I really do hate you sometimes

INT PRATCHETT’S OFFICE - DAY

ON PRATCHETT-- watching Peter and Nibs from his window He
turns away as Warwick enters

Pratchett nods to the floor where we see one of the opened
food crates the money -- visibly -- has been disturbed

PRATCHETT
They know
Fuchs 10913 14

WARWICK
Shall I advise our friends to make
room for two additional guests this
evening

Pratchett shakes his head
PRATCHETT
Take the lot of them
(he eyes Peter below)
Goodbye Peter
INT DORMITORY (KENSINGTON HOME) - NIGHT

ON A PAIR OF FEET-- carefully weighing each step so as not
to make a sound Slowly MOVE UP to see

Peter as he shoots a glance over his shoulder He makes sure
he isn’t being followed -- then proceeds

SECONDS LATER-- as Peter sneaks toward Nibs’ bed

PETER
Nibs Nibs

No response Peter leans forward pulling the BLANKET back to
reveal the bed is empty Peter reacts when--

VOICE (0OS)
Peter

Peter JUMPS spinning around to see

NIBS
Sorry Didn’t mean to scare you

PETER
Warwick is asleep We’re all clear

Peter and Nibs make their way past a series of SHUTTERED
WINDOWS as-- we HEAR a THUMP

NIBS
I thought you said Warwick was
sleeping

We hear the THUMP again

PETER
I don’t think that was Warwick

NIBS
Maybe it was--

BAM BAM BAM AT THAT MOMENT THE SHUTTERED WINDOWS BEHIND
THEM RAPIDLY SLAM OPEN ONE BY ONE -- LIKE DOMINOES --
SPOTLIGHTS FLOODING THROUGH EACH “CLOSE ENCOUNTERS” STYLE
Fuchs 10913 15

PETER
RUN

Before they can even comprehend what’s happening around them
Peter and Nibs make a desperate run for their lives as--

VWOOSH VWOOSH VWOOSH KIDS ARE BEING RIPPED OUT OF THEIR
BEDS HOODED AND THROWN OUT THE WINDOW BY STRANGERS IN THE
SHADOWS

PETER (CONTD)
Don’t look back Just don’t look--

BAM A SIDE WINDOW SLAMS OPEN AND--

NIBS
PETER

VWOOSH OUT THE WINDOW GOES--

PETER
NIBS

Peter puts the brakes on pivoting to the window only to see
where Nibs went out-

A MAN STEPPING IN WITH A CUTLASS CLENCHED BETWEEN HIS TEETH
HE TAKES THE BLADE INTO ONE HAND AND SMILES REVEALING A PAIR
OF GOLD TEETH

A LIVING BREATHING PIRATE STANDING BEFORE OUR VERY EYES

Peter backs away from the window He doesn’t see MURPHY (big
mean Irish dude) behind him who GRABS Peter hooding him and
-- in an instant -- TOSSES him kicking and screaming out the
window

OUTSIDE THE WINDOW-- BOOM Peter lands hard on the wooden
DECK of something He frantically TEARS the hood off and his
eyes widen PULL OUT to reveal

Peter is lying next to Nibs on the deck of a 160-FOOT 32-
GUN HONEST TO GOODNESS 18th CENTURY GALLEON-CLASS PIRATE
SHIP -- somehow SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR and DOCKED in the rear
courtyard along the top floor of the Kensington Home

Peter’s head swivels right to see--

HIS FELLOW ORPHANS BEING LED BELOW DECK BY THE PIRATES AND
PREPARED FOR THE JOURNEY BACK

His head swivels left to see--

WHAT MOST CLOSELY RESEMBLES A COAL-FIRED STEAM ENGINE
ATTACHED TO THE STERN OF THE SHIP EXCEPT IT’S BELCHING A
SORT OF PHOSPHORESCENT GOLD DUST AS THE BOATSWAIN AND HIS
MATE SHOVEL WHITE ROCKS WITH AMBER-COLORED VEINS INTO IT

At which point Peter’s attention is drawn up to see--
Fuchs 10913 16

THE BLACK and WHITE SKULL and CROSSBONES FLAG FLUTTERING UP
ABOVE

ON PETER and NIBS-- lost in the shuffle they scamper to hide
behind a row of BARRELS

PETER (CONTD)
Youre dreaming This is a dream

NIBS
We can’t be having the same dream
Peter

Peter pokes his head over the side of the barrels to see
Murphy securing the below deck hold trapping the orphans

MURPHY
All in

ON PETER and NIBS-- at the ledge of the ship

NIBS
We have to jump We have to

Peter looks down at the drop and his face goes white Shakes
his head

PETER
There’s got to be another way

ON TURK -- Anatolian with the arms of a wrestler and the
eyes of a killer stands at the wheel of the ship

TURK
Sails up Everybody hold tight

ANGLE ON THE FRONT OF THE KENSINGTON HOME-- from this vantage
point the ship is totally concealed All seems calm when--
the ship slowly appears over the roof of the building it’s
sails rapidly rising

TURK (CONT’D)
And away

Peter and Nibs prepare to jump back to the roof

TURK (CONT’D)
We

Nibs JUMPS first landing safely Peter hesitates just can’t
bring himself to do it

NIBS
Come on

He finally steels himself to LEAP as- the sails reach full
mast catching a gust of winter wind

TURK
GO
Fuchs 10913 17
WOOSH AND WITH THAT THE SHIP SHOOTS STRAIGHT PAST US
HURTLING UPWARD INTO THE NIGHT SKY

NIBS
Peter

ON NIBS-- standing on the roof alone helpless as he watches
Peter and the ship sail away

As the ship flies past us we catch its name for the first
time emblazoned on its bow

THE JOLLY ROGER

ON PETER-- as he sneaks a glimpse over the side to see
London rapidly disappearing into miniature beneath him

Peter begins hyperventilating The first time we’ve seen him
truly panicking Can’t catch his breath He shuts his eyes

SUDDENLY-- the BARREL he has his back to is lifted up
revealing the hidden Peter to-

MURPHY
What are you doing up here

PETER
Catching a spot of fresh air

Murphy’s tremendous hands reach out to pounce on Peter when--
SFX -- a familiar AIR-RAID SIREN wails

TURK
Man the guns all of you

Murphy turns back to Peter -- only to realize Peter is gone
TURK (CONT’D)
(to Murphy)
I said all of you

Murphy hesitates then gives up on Peter races to his post

INT FILTER ROOM (RAF FIGHTER COMMAND) - SAME TIME

A female OPERATOR tears off a telegram racing through
an office filled with desk after desk of other women seated
at telegraphs Our Operator jogs out of the filter room into-

INT COMMAND OPERATIONS (RAF FIGHTER COMMAND) - CONTINUOUS

The bustling nerve center of the RAF command Our girl races
through it to find--

OPERATOR
Corporal sir
Fuchs 10913 18

A handsome CORPORAL takes the telegram Reads it then--

CORPORAL
Luftwaffe aircraft inbound

EXT JOLLY ROGER - CONTINUOUS

We RACE along the port of the ship as CANNON AFTER CANNON
rapidly poke out of the row of gun ports

ON DECK-- we watch CREWMEN race past a LARGE CRATE We PUSH
IN on the crate until we see a pair of eyes following the
action from between the wood panels

INSIDE THE CRATE-- Peter hides watching the commotion The
pirates hurry port and starboard until a familiar AERONAUTIC
RUMBLE draws Peter’s attention aft to see—-

A PAIR OF BRITISH RAF SPITFIRES INBOUND AT 240-PLUS MPH

TURK
Incoming

Just as-- BRATATATAT A HAIL OF GUNFIRE HITS THE DECK AS A
THIRD SPITFIRE STRAFES THE ROGER FROM ABOVE

The gunfire splits the box Peter’s standing in open suddenly
exposing him -- again

PETER
Oh for heavens sake

Everyone’s too preoccupied to notice though as another wave
of gunfire hits the deck Peter DUCKS for cover

TURK
Dive DIVE

VWOOSH THE ROGER ABRUPTLY NOSE DIVES AND WE’RE SUDDENLY IN
AN EPIC DOG FIGHT FOR THE AGES AS THE TRIO OF RAF FIGHTERS
CHASE THE ROGER THROUGH THE SKIES OF LONDON WITH PETER
HOLDING ON FOR DEAR LIFE
INSIDE THE SPITFIRE COCKPIT- the Pilot speaks into his radio
PILOT
Sir the aircraft--

INT COMMAND OPERATIONS (RAF FIGHTER COMMAND) - CONTINUOUS

Our CORPORAL and a cadre of COMMANDERS are huddled around the
radar station

PILOT (VO)
It-- it almost looks like a pirate
ship

There’s a beat of silence
Fuchs 10913 19

CORPORAL
Come again

EXT JOLLY ROGER - CONTINUOUS

The Roger comes shooting through the twin peaks of Londons
Tower Bridge followed by the Spitfires seconds later zooming
over the Thames water spraying in their wake

ON PETER-- as he RACES starboard desperately searching for
any surface low enough to leap out onto

Peter hesitates can’t bring himself to do it when-- the
Roger BANKS hard left and Peter goes -- VWOOM -- right OVER
the ledge of the ship falling through the air until-- BAM He
GRABS onto SOMETHING legs dangling in mid-air

BACK ON DECK-- Turk notices Peter first

TURK
We lost one THERE
We see what Turk sees

PETER WITH HIS ARMS GRASPED ONTO ONE OF THE MASSIVE HANDS ON
THE CLOCK-FACE OF BIG BEN

Peter’s POV a 300 foot plus sheer drop down to the ground

TURK (CONT’D)
Come around Let’s get him and get
the hell out of here

BACK ON PETER-- his arms starting to slip He’s not going to
make it Suddenly-

HIS HANDS SLIP AND WE WATCH HELPLESSLY AS PETER FREE FALLS
OFF OF BIG BEN PLUMMETING DOWNWARD ABOUT TO DIE WHEN--

BAM TURK CATCHES PETER SLAMMING TO THE DECK WITH HIM

TURK (CONT’D)
Hold on tight to something Were
not coming back for you twice

Peter frowns confused as Turk races to help his crewmen
ROTATE the masts

Peter’s POV - the three spitfires are inbound from three
different angles all racing toward the Roger

As the Spitfires near Peter watches mystified as the crew
ROTATES and then -- using a CRANK —- TILT the sails
horizontally until they’re PSYF rigged at an angle off the
port sand starboard of the ship like makeshift sailcloth

WIN

TURK (CONT’D)
Take us up Let’s get out of here
Fuchs 10913 20

And just as the Spitfire are about to converge on the Roger-
VWOOSH The Roger SHOOTS UP VERTICALLY like a rocket
INSIDE THE SPITFIRE COCKPIT-—

PILOT
Pull up Pull up

ON THE SPITFIRES AS THEY CRISSCROSS ONE ANOTHER JUST BARELY
AVOIDING A THREE-WAY MID-AIR COLLISION BY INCHES

BACK ON THE ROGER-- the Pirates are securing themselves to
the deck with THICK ROPES as the ship rockets upward

PULL WIDE to see a furious race to the stars as the RAF
fighters pursue the Roger vertically into the sky

The Spitfires begin rattling violently as the air pressure
and cold begin to tear them apart

FROM INSIDE THE COCKPIT- we see the Roger in the Pilot’s
cross-hairs about to fire when SUDDENLY- the engine stalls

We WATCH as the Pilot’s Spitfire drops out of the sky and he
EJECTS to safety

PILOT 2
The altitude Pull back

The TWO SPITFIRES peel off as the Roger continues throttling
skyward Pilot 2 SLAMS his fist into the altimeter

PILOT 2 (CONTD)
Damnit

ON PETER-- as he searches for anything to hold onto and finds
a ROPE He grabs it as-

TURK
Hold on

The Roger breaks through the cloud cover and-

SUDDENLY WE’RE IN ZERO-GRAVITY AS EVERYTHING NOT TIED DOWN TO
THE DECK INCLUDING PETER BRIEFLY LEVITATES WEIGHTLESS

THE ROGER STAYS SUSPENDED THERE IN THE NIGHT SKY THE
TWINKLING STARS ABOVE NOW INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THEIR
REFLECTION IN THE WATER BELOW SO THAT FOR AN INSTANT WE
APPEAR TO BE ENVELOPED BY THEM ON EVERY SIDE ADRIFT ON A
CELESTIAL OCEAN

ON PETER-- entranced he REACHES out to a star so close it
feels like he can grasp it

As he does our ANGLE on the Roger ROTATES 180 degrees so
that up is down and down is u And just when Peter’s fingers
are about to make contact wit “that star-
Fuchs 10913 21

VWOOSH Gravity KICKS BACK IN in the reverse direction the
ship PLUMMETING DOWNWARD into what we thought was night sky
Peter’s grip on the taut rope the only thing preventing him
from hurtling off the deck into space

WIDE ON THE ROGER -- AS IT DROPS LIKE A STONE SPINNING
WILDLY THE STARS A BLUR AROUND IT UNTIL THE SHIP DROPS INTO
THE CLOUDS AND SUDDENLY--

THE SHIP BEGINS TO DECELERATE THE CONDENSED WATER VAPOR
SLOWING ITS FALL

ON PETER-- as he stands rubbing his eyes to see the ship
engulfed in a cloud cover so dense you can’t see a foot past
the bow

The PIRATES lead the ORPHANS from below up onto the deck as
the Roger EMERGES out of the clouds to reveal

AN ISLAND AHEAD OF THEM UNLIKE ANYTHING WE HAVE EVER SEEN

It’s a tropical dreamland Lush green rainforest everywhere
we look Epic waterfalls In the far distance a mountain
range that’s Tora Bora meets Everest

ON PETER-- ashe and the other orphans stare at this strange
magnificent place in abject wonder When he hears a BUZZING
noise and turns to see

A flock of FLYING FISH their wings vibrating rapidly like a
hummingbird’s all moving in perfect harmony In an instant--

VWOOM The flock DIVES as one Peter races to the edge of the
bow to see the fish are diving into

A FLOATING LAGOON -- LITERALLY A MASSIVE FLOATING BODY OF
WATER SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR WITH ALL MANNER OF SEA-LIFE
SWIMMING AROUND INSIDE

The flying fish dive in and emerge with mouthfuls of smaller
fish PULL WIDE TO REVEAL

THE ROGER DESCENDING THROUGH A FIELD OF IDENTICAL FLOATING
LAGOONS DOTTING THE SKY ABOVE AND BELOW THEM

TURK (CONTD)
(behind Peter)
I wouldn’t think about diving in

ANGLE ON A FLOATING LAGOON BELOW-- we see the vague outline
of a flying fish as it’s--

CHOMP CONSUMED by a SILHOUETTED CREATURE that’s crocodilian
in shape but dinosaur-like in scale easily 14 feet and 7-8
tons of pure reptilian predator

TURK (CONT ’D)
Crocs
Fuchs 10913 22

PETER
(eyes wide)
This is impossible

TURK
Nothing’s impossible here

ANGLE ON-- a SHEER CLIFF FACE pockmarked by tunnel openings
looming over them as the Roger approaches

PETER
Where is ‘here’
TURK
(smiles)

Home

The Roger its sails returned to their vertical position
SAILS into one of the TUNNEL OPENINGS

INT TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

It’s pitch black and silent but for the sound of water
lapping at the tunnel’s sides As the Roger moves deeper
though our eyes adjust to see

ALONG THE BANKS OF THE CANAL -- A FEW DOZEN CHILDREN PICK
AXES IN HAND CHIPPING AWAY AT THE TUNNEL WALLS THEIR FACES
ILLUMINATED BY 18TH CENTURY STYLE MINERS CANDLESTICKS
JABBED INTO CREVICES IN THE STONE

The Roger continues on toward a light at the end of the
tunnel As we reach the light the tunnel passage opens up on
one side to reveal below

THOUSANDS OF YOUNG ADULTS OF EVERY RACE COLOR AND CREED TOIL
IN IMPOSSIBLY MASSIVE MINING PITS THAT RESEMBLE THE DIAMOND
MINES OF EARTH BUT ON AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE SCALE

Hundreds of LADDERS protrude out of these epic terrestrial
cavities YOUNG SLAVES covered with thick MUD their faces
barely recognizable as human scale the ladders with heavy
loads on their backs

At the top of the craters we see even YOUNGER SLAVES sifting
through the piles of dirt and rock carried out of the pit

The brutal inhumanity of this work is a terrifying si ht
Peter can’t believe what he’s seeing He SWALLOWS har

ON THE ROGER-- as it passes into another tunnel suddenly-

The ship ZOOMS DOWN an incline the water SPRAYING into our
faces until it shoots out of the tunnel into--
EXT SUBETERRANEAN LAGOON - CONTINUOUS

The Roger SPITS out into a massive lagoon filled with DOZENS
OF SHIPS just like it
Fuchs 10913 23

Galleon upon Galleon filled with wide eyed ORPHANS like
ours trying to figure out what’s going on and where the hell
they are

SUDDENLY-- a SHADOW slowly moves over them All look up to
see--

A SHIP SLOWLY GLIDING INTO POSITION OVER THE TOP OF THE
CAVERN THAT MAKES THE GALLEONS LOOK LIKE TOY BOATS IN A TUB
AN 18TH CENTURY 100-GUN 200-FOOT SHIP OF THE LINE

ON THE SHIP-- as its bow passes over us we catch the name on
its side QUEEN ANNE’S REVENGE

ON THE ORPHANS OF EVERY SHIP-- as the pirates PROD them to
kneel toward the ship floating over them Peter refuses

PETER

I don’t bow to anyone
TURK

Oh you’ll bow to him

ANGLE ON TWIN GLEAMING WUSHU HOOK SWORDS-- as they’re both
sheathed in rapid succession

TURK (VO)
He’s the pirate all pirates fear

ANGLE ON AN ICONIC FEATHERED PIRATE HAT-- as it’s retrieved
off a hat stand

TURK
The original nightmare

CU -- on the eyes of someone eviland cunning

We don’t yet see his face We do see his immediatel
recognizable flowing CRIMSON COAT and the TWO SWORDS peeking
out from either side of it as he walks

BELOW ON THE ROGER-- Turk PUSHES little Peter to his knees

TURK (CONT’D)
The man they call-

On the Captain as he turns to reveal the face of--

TURK (CONT’D)
Blackbeard

Who were you expecting Meet BLACKBEARD (42 mesmerizing
features) waves to the kneeled children below basking in
their forced adulation -- their fear

BLACKBEARD
Hear me you abandoned children of
another world Where you come from
you were the missing The unwanted
The unloved But not here

(MORE)
Fuchs 10913 24

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)
Here you join orphans alike from
every corner of the globe in a
place where you never have to fear
Never have to want Never have to
be alone again

The way he speaks it’s almost Svengali like We can see the
orphans slowly falling under his spell as the Revenge drifts
over their heads

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)
Here we will join together in these
mines hand in hand as one
digging for the Dust that allows us
to travel between your old world
and your new one The dust that
will allow us to liberate more of
your brothers your sisters so
never again do they have to suffer
as you have suffered We shall
work so that they -- like you now -
- can be free

Blackbeard smiles warmly -- genuinely

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)
Welcome Welcome you lost souls
now found to a place we call
grandly)
Neverland

And slowly out of fear or hope maybe both -- who knows --
these kids start to CHEER And Blackbeard REVELS in it

ON PETER-- stone faced and more alone than ever

EXT ENTRY GATE - DUST MINES - DAY

We follow a SEA OF ORPHANS as they’re herded through a narrow
rocky passway into the mines as FEARSOME GUARDS watch over
them

ON PETER-- as a PICK-AXE is thrust into his hand by a GUARD
before he’s SHOVED forward

EXT DUST MINES - DAY

CU ON A PICK AXE AS-- THWACK It SLAMS into granite

FOREMAN (0S
For those of you just joining us

Widen as we TRACK a FOREMAN close-cropped hair a face
that might once have been sweet as he moves down an endless
row of YOUNG ORPHANS -- a tableau of bondage straight out of
Exodus - as they SLAM their axes into the rock
Fuchs 10913 25

FOREMAN (CONTD)
ed name’s Sam Sam Smiegel and
it’s my unfortunate pleasure to
wetcome you to the rest of your

ife

We finally LAND on Peter as he STRAINS to lift the axe

SAM
It’s pretty simple really You all
here are diggers like me And what
we’re looking for are these
lovelies

The Foreman holds up one of those white rocks

SAM (CONTD)
Pixum This is what fairy dust is
made out of The bones of long dead
fairies

PETER
Fairies are-- they’re real

SAM
Were Past tense There were
millions of them all over the
island until the pirates hunted
them into extinction

PETER
(still in disbelief)
But you mean actual fairies

VETERAN MINER
Hey new guy

RACK FOCUS to see a few miners over a VETERAN MINER (male
late 20s) in the garb of a slave but with the swagger --
not to mention rugged good looks -- of Han Solo

VETERAN MINER (CONT’D)
You just arrived here on a flying
pirate ship Real should be a very
luid concept for you right now

PETER
I was just curious is all

VETERAN MINER
Yeah well next time you get
curious my advice
(smiles )
Shut up and dig

The miner glares at Peter and goes back to work

SAM
Well then -- any other questions

Peter shakes his head and gets to work DISSOLVE TO
Fuchs 10913 26

SERIES OF SHOTS-- as we watch Peter SLAVING away in the
mines DIGGING LIFTING heavy loads asthe CAMP GUARDS watch
over him and the other miners A time lapse tableau of life
in the camps Finally land on--

Peter silhouetted against the sunset as he digs tirelessly
into the night Somehow the sunset looks different in
Neverland The sun itself seems physically bigger the
streaks of pinks and purples in the sky more brilliant
INT MINERS’ CAMP - NIGHT

CU -- Peter’s hand is worn so raw it’s bloodied

Peter seated at the edge of a cot tears a piece of FABRIC
off his shirt and WINCES as he begins to WRAP his wound

SFX -- the sound of METAL SHEARING AGAINST METAL

ANGLE ON-- an iconic METAL HOOK making sparks against the
blade of miner’s axe TILT UP to reveal

VETERAN MINER
Give me yours

The Vet is seated in the corner on a stool sharpening his
axe He doesn’t even look up at Peter

VETERAN MINER (CONT’D)
Your axe Give it to me

Peter hesitantly hands it over

VETERAN MINER (CONT’D)
Your hand’s all messed up because
your blade is blunted You keep
swinging like that you’re going to
end up breaking your wrist

As the miner sharpens Peter’s blade using the hook

PETER
I’m Peter by the way

The miner just keeps sharpening the blade

PETER (CONTD)
Why do they want it so badly The
dust

VETERAN MINER
What’d I tell you about asking so
many questions Rule number one of
staying alive in these mines is
keep your head down You can’t
trust anyone Blackbeard has
informants everywhere inside the
camps Rule number two always
listen to me

(MORE)
Fuchs 10913 27

VETERAN MINER (CONTD)

You break either of those mark my
words this’ll end up being the
shortest trip of your life

(then
The Dust 1s Neverland’s most
precious natural resource With it
You live forever Never age never
die Basically the Fountain of
Youth That’s the reason they want
it It’s everything to them They
kill for it We die for it Happy

He SHOVES the ax back at Peter

PETER
Thanks

VETERAN MINER
Don’t thank me I don’t care about
you I care about us making our
quota If you can’t dig we don’t
eat It’s that simple Are we
clear

Peter nods as the Vet STANDS and DISAPPEARS deeper into the
camp Peter watches him go

INT DUST MINES - DAY

Peter chops away y getting the hang of it when he notices the
Vet standing a few orphans down

ON THE VET-- shirtless and chopping like a machine

PETER (0S)
Hey

The Vet turns to see Peter standing there Goes back to
chopping

PETER (CONTD)
I just wanted to say that if
there’s ever anything I could do to
repay you-

VETERAN MINER
You want to make it up to me Stay
away from me

Peter nods and goes back to chopping The Vet eyes his
proximity annoyed but just ignores him Then-

WE HEAR A YOUNG GIRL’S SCREAMS

Twenty feet we a YOUNG SLAVE GIRL is on the ground as
a CAMP GUARD Body by Bane) looms over her WHIPPING the
ground at her Pests terrifying her

Peter disturbed starts to approach and the Vet grabs him
Fuchs 10913 28

VETERAN MINER (CONTD)
Don’t Getting involved is only
going to turn bad into worse trust
me I’ve seen it

THWACK As the whip CRACKS into the ground next to the girl’s
head

ON PETER-- his jaw clenches Every instinct in his body
telling him to do something

ON THE SLAVE GIRL’S FACE-- tears streaming as her eyes meet
Peter’s in the distance Her eyes PLEADING with him Help

Peter has to turn away The Vet nods
VETERAN MINER (CONT ’D)
Alright then Maybe you’re not as
dumb as you--

The Vet looks back and Peter is gone He turns to see Peter
halfway to the slave girl

VETERAN MINER (CONTD)
Nope -- even dumber Damn it Kid

ON THE SLAVE GIRL-- as she shields her face from the guard
when we hear--

PETER
You’re hurting her

The guard turns to see Peter standing behind him looks at
this little waif confused

CAMP GUARD 1
Did you say something Slave

VETERAN MINER
(intervening)
No No he didn’t Excuse us--

PETER
I said you’re hurting her

The Camp Guard almost laughs Who is this kid

CAMP GUARD 1
Well then maybe youd like to
have a word with the Captain about
that The both of you

Off Peter’s suddenly worried face--

EXT QUEEN ANNE’S REVENGE - DAY

THUMP THUMP THUMP A series of PLANKS poke into position off
the ship’s starboard
Fuchs 10913 29

BELOW-- the miners see the Revenge slowly moving into
position over them stop their work and begin to cheer

ON THE SHIP-- at the foot of each plank the PIRATES position
a slave child We MOVE DOWN the row of kids until we land on--

PETER
What’s going on

The pirate behind him just stares back when suddenly the
cheers ERUPT as--

BLACKBEARD
Hear me

Blackbeard steps onto the deck waving to the cheering crowd

BLACKBEARD (CONTD
You brave heroes of Neverlan

His voice ECHOES loudly in the mines as the cheers rise
Blackbeard smiles

BLACKBEARD (CONT’D
Behold these traitors whose fates I
entrust to your noble hands

ON PETER and THE VET-- as they and the other SLAVES are PRODDED
out onto the PLANKS Peter looks down and immediately looks
ready to vomit

VETERAN MINER
Still hate the rules now

Blackbeard strides toward the first plank at the edge of
which stands a YOUNG ASIAN TEEN

BLACKBEARD
This one was caught stealing from
the grain stores TWICE Shall you
have mercy
(jeers from the crowd)
Or not

The crowd CHEERS and with that-- BOOM The TEEN is shoved off
the plank PLUMMETING to his death

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)
The people have spoken

Blackbeard moves on to the next kid

ON PETER-- he’s third in line Not good He eyes the several
hundred-story drop

PETER
Do they ever have mercy

VETERAN MINER
They have good days and bad
Fuchs 10913 30
PETER
How’s today feeling

We hear loud JEERS and then the second slave gets PUSHED off
his plank flailing as he drops

PETER CONT’ D)
Don’t answer that

Blackbeard moves on to Peter
BLACKBEARD
Here we have a new arrival In the
mines less than a day and within
hours involved in the brutal
beating of a young girl

PETER
Hey Wait

A PIRATE prods Peter shutting him up

BLACKBEARD
I ask-- shall you have mercy
(loud Jeers)
Or not
Crowds CHEER loudly

VETERAN MINER
Nice knowing you kid

Blackbeard nods The PIRATE behind Peter raises his sword

BLACKBEARD
The people have spoken

And with that- BOOM Peter is PUSHED off the plank SCREAMING
as he PLUMMETS

ON THE VET-- who looks away Can’t bear to watch it
ON THE CROWDS-- enjoying the spectacle

CLOSE ON PETER-- about to meet his maker He CLOSES HIS EYES
preparing for impact when--

SUDDENLY WE HEAR A HUSH FALL OVER THE CROWD SILENCE IN THE
MINE -- AND THEN A BUILDING CACOPHONY OF WHISPERS

ON PETER-- as he slowly opens his eyes to see

SOMEHOW -- SOME WAY -- HE IS SUSPENDED IN MID AIR AS IF FOR
AN INSTANT FOR ONE BOY GRAVITY HAS CEASED TO EXIST

It’s impossibleand it’s happening before our very eyes

No one knows what to make of this sight The crowds just
STARE several thousand pairs of eyeballs LOCKED on Peter
Fuchs 10913 31

VETERAN MINER
So much for keeping your head
down

ON BLACKBEARD-- who watches intrigued

BACK ON PETER-- who can’t figure out what’s going on and as
he stares down at the terrifying drop still beneath him we
see panic set in His eyes FLUTTER and we-- FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN

INT CAPTAINS QUARTERS - NIGHT

ON PETER-- as he AWAKENS with a start leaping off the 18th
century French Rococo sofa he was asleep on He SPINS around
taking in the lavishly appointed captain’s quarters

As Peter explores the room his eyes trail over the assorted
TREASURES on display A SKULL OF SOLID PLATINUM a GOLDEN
STAFF and finally a wall of every SWORD and BLADE
imaginable

Peter tries to PULL one off but the weapons won’t budge

He continues making his way to the back of the room where we
find a PANORAMIC TURRET WINDOW looking out over Neverland

PETER’S POV - through the window we see DUST MINE AFTER
DUST MINE dotting the coast Beyond the mines we see a
MASSIVE WALL SPANNING HUNDREDS OF MILES a colossal
fortification the likes of which our world has never seen

And beyond the Wall interminable WILDERNESS stretching out
to the horizon

BLACKBEARD (0S)
Beautiful isn’t it

Peter SPINS to see-- Blackbeard on the other side of the
room removing a jade cigarette holder from between his lips
He slowly makes his way to the window as he speaks like a
beast carefully stalking his prey

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)
I remember the first time I saw
this island It was like a dream
you never had to wake up from

He stands next to Peter taking in the view with him

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)
You and I have something in common
Peter I’m an orphan too Orphans
like us we understand each other
in a way no one else can
(then)

(MORE)
Fuchs 10913 32

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)
I remember in my orphanage in
Bristol the nuns reading us
bedtime stories about a place like
this When you’re a child all
alone in the world stories are the
only things you have to hold on to

Peter nods hesitantly

BLACKBEARD (CONT’D)
Can I tell you a story Peter Out
there beyond that Wall lies a
savage people And these savages
they have a story -- an ancient
prophesy from the time before
times when the Fairy Kingdoms
reigned -- about an epoch when
darkness would descend upon the
land It was foretold that one
day there would be a boy born of
the love between a fairy prince and
a human slave girl A boy who would
be disappeared from this world and
then in time return to vanquish
the darkness -- to bring peace to
Neverland A boy it was said

(eyes Peter)

Who could fly

Peter’s eyes widen Blackbeard smiles

PETER
You think I’m that boy

BLACKBEARD
I don’t believe in bedtime stories
I do believe we make our own
destinies and here on this island
that’s what I’ve done I forged a
home for those who had none That’s
a special thing wouldn’t you
agree

PETER
I guess

He unsheathes one of his hook swords backing Peter up
against the window

BLACKBEARD
And special things they need to be
protected
(holds the blade to
Peter’s neck)
Sometimes at great cost

PETER
I would never do anything to
endanger this place sir

Theyre practicall nose to nose He brings the hooked blade
up to Peter’s cheek gently stroking it
Fuchs 10913 33

BLACKBEARD
I know that but the thing is
Peter you re a freak -- and freaks

can destroy the very things they
love the most like a brilliant
flame burning those it meant only
to warm And as with a flame you
can either control it -- or snuff
it out of existence altogether

He SCRAPES Peter’s cheek with the hook drawing a sliver of
blood

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)
What shall we do with you Peter
What shall we dowith you

INT BRIG - LATER

The Vet sits alone deep in thought When we hear- the CELL
DOOR open and then SLAM shut He looks up to see Peter as
he’s THROWN into the cell by a guard

ON PETER-- he dusts himself off

VETERAN MINER (0S)
Fly boy

Peter turns to see the Vet behind him

VETERAN MINER (CONT’D)
That was some show you put on up
there

PETER
I thought you wanted me to leave
you alone

Peter heads to the other end of the cell The Vet follows

VETERAN MINER
That was when I thought you were
just a pain in my ass

PETER
Oh and what am I now

VETERAN MINER
My ticket out of here

PETER
And exactly why would I help you

VETERAN MINER

Don’t you get it Blackbeard can’t
let you live You’re a threat You
stay on die

Your (Thee e air show can you do it
again
Fuchs 10913 34

ET
Don’t tell me you believe in this
prophesy too

VETERAN MINER
Not even a little but I don’t
really care how you did what you
just did up there just that you
can do it again because if you
canZI can get us out of here

PETER
And if I can’t

VETERAN MINER
Then you’re as useless as I thought
you were

Peter considers it -- no other way out He nods

PETER
(false bravado)
I can do it You saw me Just --
what is it exactly that you need
me for

VETERAN MINER
I’m trying to save your life you
make it sound like I’m trying to
sell you something
He eyes the Guard outside the cell noticing the conflict

VETERAN MINER (CONT’D)
You know what Fine

He SHOVES Peter hard

VETERAN MINER (CONT’D)
Die in here See if I care

He SHOVES Peter again - harder Peter shoves back

PETER
What is your problem

PRISON GUARD
(entering the cell)
Hey Keep it down in there

As the Prison Guard approaches from behind Peter

VETERAN MINER
My problem is I thought I told you
eep your head down
(looks to Peter
exasperated)
I said- keep it - DOWN
Fuchs 10913 35

Peter frowns then- GETS IT and DUCKS just in time as- BAM
The Vet TAKES A FIERCE SWING at the Guard SMASHING into his
face sends him down hard then drops down and retrieves his
sword

VETERAN MINER (CONT’D)
There’s more where he came from I
don’t know about you but I’m not
waiting around to see if his pals
are any friendlier

Peter stands

PETER
If I’m going to trust you I want
to at least know your name

VETERAN MINER
Oh for the love of- fine Hook The
name’s James Hook Happy Now let’s
get the hell out of here

INT DUST MINES - MOMENTS LATER
Sam is hard at work balanced on scaffolding digging when--

cmee HOOK (0S)

Sam -- or as we’ll now call him -- SMEE looks between his
feet and sees HOOK staring up from underneath his face
visible between the boards of scaffolding

SMEE
I hate when you call me that

HOOK
Complain later Can you get us to
the top of the Wall
SMEE
Up I can get you Down’s the
problem
Hook smiles and pulls Peter into Smee’s line of sight

HOOK

Not today

EXT THE WALL - DAY

An intricate HALLIDIE ROPEWAY SYSTEM (basically an old
fashioned cable car set-up for mines) ZOOMS people and
supplies from the mines below to scaffolding lining the Wall
above

ON OUR HEROES-- as they hide around a corner waiting for a
GROUP OF PIRATES to pass then surreptitiously board one of
the cable cars rapidly headed up
Fuchs 10913

HOOK
I know listening isn’t your strong
suit so try to pay attention

Peter shoots him a look Hook ignores it

HOOK (CONTD)

On the other side of that wall is a
sheer mile long drop into the
Neverwood -- the only place on this
island more dangerous than the
camps which means the only safe
way out of here is on one of those

(nods to a passing pirate

ship mid-air)
Problem is they never set sail
without a Grew of at least a dozen
men Two men versus twelve aren’t
my kind of odds

PETER
re himself)
Well three Three men

HOOK
stares at Peter then)
Like I said -- two
moving on)
If were going to have a chance in
hell of goingce an air-Galleon
were going to have to steal it
when there’s no one onboard
oints)
When it’s up there

As they clear another layer of scaffolding breaking the

cloud cover we see-

HOOK (CONTD)
The Skyport

A FLOATING PORT STRUCTURE RESEMBLING THE OLD PORT ROYAL

HOVERING HIGH ABOVE THE MINES AND FAR ENOUGH FROM THE WALL

THAT A LEAP WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE

HOOK (CONTD)
Impossible to reach unless youve
got a ship Or you

ON PETER’S FACE-- the terror mounting

HOOK (CONTD)
Well get you to the op of the
water silo that’s the highest
point on the Wall right there

We VISUALLY ID the WATER SILO -- frighteningly high

HOOK (CONTD)
That should give you a straight
shot at the nearest ship

(MORE)
Fuchs 10913 37

HOOK (CONTD)
You fly onboard get it to us and
well take it from there

PETER
Your plan is for me to leap from
several hundred stories in the air
fly down and assuming at that
point I’m not yet dead pirate a
pirate ship -- from pirates

Hook nods

PETER (CONT’D)
Brilliant

HOOK
If there’s something you’re not
telling me-

PETER
No Just- get me up there

HOOK
That’s more like it

When SUDDENLY -- the cable car STOPS

HOOK (CONT’D
Smee we need to get higher

SMEE
That wasn’t me

With a JERK- the car begins moving BACKWARDS Hook spins
around to see

At the far end of the rope line a DETACHMENT OF PIRATES is
slowly REELING them back in They’re caught

HOOK
So much for the water tower You’re
going to have to do it now Smee
help me hold the line I want to
give the kid his best shot

Hook and Smee race to the edge of the car trying to stop its
reverse motion

PETER’S POV - THE NEAREST AIR-GALLEON SITS DOCKED AT THE
SKYPORT SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET AWAY

PETER
You want me to jump from here

HOOK
Got a better idea

VWUMP -- the car gets dragged closer to the pirates as Hook
and Smee STRAIN to hold it in place
Fuchs 10913 38

Peter steps up to the ledge of the cable car looks down at
the drop below -- his face goes ashen

HOOK (CONTD)
You waiting for a formal
invitation What’s the problem

Peter turns to Hook and Smee looking visibly ill

PETER
I-- I’m not good with heights

HOOK
What do you mean you’re not good
with heights You can fly

PETER
(hesitates then-)
Not until yesterday

HOOK
Yesterday Yesterday was your
first time

VWUMP The cable car pulls closer to the pirates

PETER
Hey this wasn’t my plan

HOOK
You think maybe you should’ve
erie this to my attention a
little earlier You said you could

PETER
Well perhap ps if you’d shared your
full plan with me before we were
twenty kilometers in the air--

VWUMP The Pirates almost have them

SMEE
Can we argue about this later

ON PETER-- looking over that ledge air-Galleons
crisscrossing the sky below his mind racing when-

PETER
The axe Smee give it

Smee KICKS his axe across the floor to Peter who GRABS it

HOOK
What are you going to do throw it
at ‘em

PETER

Not exactly

Peter RAISES the ax above his head and-
Fuchs 10913 39

VWAM HE SWINGS THE AXE DOWN INTO THE TAUT ROPES HOLDING THE
CABLE CAR THE THICK ROPES SPLINTER BUT DON’T SPLIT AS THE
CAR SHUDDERS

HOOK
(leaps to stop him)
Are you insane DON’T

Before Hook can stop him- VWAM He SWINGS the axe into the
ropes again but this time-

KVWOOSH THE ROPES SPLIT AND THE CAR DROPS SWINGING LIKE A
PENDULUM TOWARD AN AIR-GALLEON SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET BELOW

ON OUR HEROES-- SCREAMING the whole way down
HOOK (CONTD)
If we dont die Im going to kill
youl

PETER
Lean in Left Toward the ship

THEY ALL LEAN PLUMMETING DOWN DOWN DOWN TOWARD THEIR
TARGET UNTIL--

A SECOND AIR-GALLEON CROSSES INTO THEIR PATH OUT OF NOWHERE
TAKING US -- AND THEM -- BY SURPRISE AS-

HOOK
(eyes widen)
Oh sh-

BAM They CONNECT with the ship the pirate crew SCATTERING
as the base of the cable car HITS with such impact it TEARS
through the deck its impact KNOCKING the ship off course

QUANTITIES OF WATER begin to rain down on them followed by
the MASSIVE SILO TOWER as it COLLAPSES sending miners
FLEEING for cover

BACK ON THE SHIP-- our heroes race to the WHEEL spinning
wildly Hook GRABS it trying to steady the ship as its port-
side GRINDS into the Wall SPARKS flying

HOOK
Cmon Help me turn it

As Hook and Smee strain to steer back on course Peter looks
back and pales

PETER
Uh -- Hook

HOOK
What now I’m trying to steer

Hook and Smee turn to see the entire PIRATE CREW closing in
on them A dozen men against three
Fuchs 10913 41

SMEE
(looks to Peter)
I hope you fight better than you
fly

Peter lifts his axe -- steps toward the pirates fearless

PETER
Id rather die free than live as a
slave

HOOK
Yeah neither of those options
sound so terrific to me Hold on
tight I’m gonna try something

Peter and Smee look to each other What’s he talking about
They GRAB hold of the RAILING behind the wheel as--

HOOK (CONTD)
Lets even the odds

Hook SPINS the wheel VIOLENTLY FLIPPING THE ENTIRE AIR-

his eye

PETER
What is that

PETER’S POV -- a narrow RIVER runs along the base of the
Wall hundreds of stories below Along either side of the
river we see

AIR-GALLEON AFTER AIR-GALLEON UNDER CONSTRUCTION -- HUNDREDS
OF SHIPS VISIBLE STRETCHING OUT TO THE HORIZON A FLYING
ARMADA BEING CONSTRUCTED IN SECRET

PETER (CONTD)
Why would Blackbeard need so many
ships

Before Smee can answer--

BOOM BOOM BOOM A VOLLEY OF CANNON-FIRE EXPLODING ALL
AROUND THEM THE CONCUSSIVE FORCE SENDING PETER AND SMEE ONTO
THEIR BACKS

Peter sits up to see the Revenge along with FOUR OTHER AIR-
SHIPS in hot pursuit

been DESTROYED

We lost the engine

ON BLACKBEARD-- staring at himself in the mirror

He removes the top of an URN in front of him reaching in and
pulling out a small spoon filled with the dust

ON A LIT CANDLE-- over which Blackbeard holds the spoonful of
dust He BOWS his head over it inhaling the fumes and when
he LIFTS his head back up--

HE IS A MAN REBORN -- WRINKLES VANISHED SKIN REVITALIZED
EASILY TEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN A MOMENT AGO

He turns to see--

The stolen ship took more damage
than intended It went down in the

boy now

Blackbeard doesn’t react He moves toward Turk
BLACKBEARD
I said I wanted him alive

I didn’t say anything about you

Turk’s eyes WIDEN as Blackbeard pulls away to reveal a
DAGGER plunged into Turk’s stomach Turk falls to his knees

Blackbeard goes back to the urn takes another spoonful of
the dust and heats it over the flame

ON TURK-- on the floor dying Blackbeard kneels next to him

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)
The next time I ask for something

He PRESSES the scalding hot spoon against Turk’s open wound

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)

He takes the spoon away to reveal the wound now completely
healed

EXT NEVERWOOD - DAY

ANGLE ON-- the dense canopy of the forest above us We HEAR
the TWITTERING sounds of unseen wildlife hidden within the
cyan shadows of the foliage TILT DOWN past stunning
TROPICAL TREES that reach higher into the sky than Earth’s
tallest skyscrapers to see

Peter his face bloodied lying alone on the grass among the
towering trees He opens his eyes with a grimace and sits up
We HEAR an adorable inquisitive COOING sound and Peter turns
to see-

A PLANT with undulating tendrils that reach toward Peter
affectionately Peter fascinated reaches out petting the
tendrils which PURR appreciatively in response

Peter stands dusting himself off As his foot steps onto the
FERN-LIKE GRASS--

VWOOSH The blades of grass FLY OFF THE GROUND like a swarm
of butterflies that have been disturbed each individual
blade FLAPPING its erstwhile “wings” as the flock of grass
makes its way up into the forest understory

ON PETER-- taking in the majesty of this place when- we HEAR
voices Peter cautiously heads in their direction As he
exits the plant tendrils reach after him warbling
defeatedly

EXT CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

Peter emerges to find the RUINS OF THE AIR-GALLEON half
lodged in a tree half dispersed all over the ground Hook
and Smee are picking through the rubble searching for
anything salvageable

ON SMEE-- as he finds a POCKET-KNIFE when-

PETER
Hey

Hook and Smee turn to see Peter approaching Smee pockets the
knife Hook throws down a piece of debris enraged storms
toward Peter

SMEE
Easy

OOK
Our only way off this island and
it’s in pieces Satisfied Do you
know how many years I’ve spent in
those camps Waiting Planning
Fuchs 10913 45

PETER
We have the ship We can fix it We
can take the parts and--

HOOK
It’s not about the ship Peter
It’s about the dust We don’t have
an

I had one chance of getting home
and it’s over because of YOU

Hook stops himself Defeated

HOOK (CONTD)
We should get moving The pirates
will be looking for us We can’t
stay here The deeper into the
woods we get the more dangerous
the wildlife We should make for
the coast regroup there

PETER
You guys go ahead

Peter walks past them toward the wreckage

HOOK
Where are you going

Peter ignores them Smee and Hook exchange a look

INSIDE THE WRECKAGE-- Peter digs furiously through the
rubble Whatever he’s looking for he can’t seem to find it

HOOK Contd)
Hey Kid didn’t you hear me Quit
messing around

Peter SPOTS the object of his search on the floor a dusty
piece of rolled up PARCHMENT

HOOK (CONTD)
What is that

He kneels unraveling it to reveal
PETER

It’s a map of the island I figured
every ship has to have one

HOOK
What are you planning to do with
that

PETER

Blackbeard spoke about a Native
prophesy A prophesy he thought was
about me and where I came from

(MORE )
Fuchs 10913

PETER (CONTD)
If he’s right it means my mum is
from here which means they might
know where she is

HOOK
They -- you mean the Natives Are
you insane They’d just as soon
skin you as help you

Maybe but vthey’ re my best chance
at finding my mother You can run
back to Eart I’m staying here
I’m going to find them and then I’m
going to find her

Hook is speechless as Peter walks past him

BACK IN THE CLEARING-- as Peter marches past Smee Hook
follows him out

HOOK
Do you have any idea what’s out
there This ain’t our world You
ever look for a monster under your
bed at night and there’s nothing
there Want to know why

then

Because the monsters are all here --
in this forest

PETER
I’m not afraid

HOOK
Oh please Grow up There’s a
difference between being brave and
being stupid kid and one day not
knowing the difference is going to
get you in a whole lot of trouble --
or worse You hear me

Peter just keeps walking

HOOK (CONTD)
So that’s it that’s how this
ends You just walk away

Peter stops turns to Hook

PETER
If I’d told youI didn’t know how
to fly you would’ve left me in
that brig to rot I’m sorry I lied
to you but let’s not pretend we’re
friends all of a sudden

Peter spins on his heel and walks off
Fuchs 10913 47

HOOK
Fine FINE Good luck You won’t
stand a chance out there on your
own And what’s more I don’t care

Peter disappears into the woods Hook looks to Smee

HOOK (CONT’D
Good riddance that kid was bad
luck anyway He was going to get us
both killed

SMEE
Hookhe won’t last an hour alone
out there

HOOK
That’s his problem Not ours

They resume the search for supplies

SMEE
If he was the “chosen one”
though

HOOK

There is no chosen one Smee It’s
a fairy tale for kids

SMEE
But if the Natives thought he was --
I bet they’d reward handsomely
whosoever found him
then)
Maybe even in Pixum

Hook stops Considers that
HOOK
If the Natives realize he’s just a

kid that he’s a fake -- you know
they’11l kill him

SMEE
What’s the difference Without us
out there he’s dead anyway
Besideswho knows He did fly

Hook takes a deep breath eyes Smee with a shake of his head

I got a bad feeling about this

PETER HOOK AND SMEE making their way through the Neverwood
a place of staggering natural beautypassing beneath
luminescent JELLYFISH WILLOWS trees with TRANSLUCENT
PULSATING LIMBS that hang liké swarms of jell fishthrough
endless fields of almost FLUORESCENT BAMBOO that DING like
the keys of a xylophone as Peter runs his fingers across
themhiking up a MOSSY ROCK that unexpectedly RISES from
beneath them revealing itself to be the SHELL OF A MASSIVE
NEVERTURTLE

It’s a wilderness straight out of the deepest recesses of our
imagination Utterly breathtaking unlike anything weve ever
seen A far cry from the Kensington Home and Peter is loving
every surreal minute of it

for me Something must have
pape ened to her She meant tocome
bac she wouldn’t have just left

Oh yeah And why’s that

Don’t you guys ever wonder what
happened to your mothers

I suppose I’d be curious to know

HOOK

I got the telegram

Everyone is silent for a moment Then-

PETER
I’m sorry

HOOK
Don’t be She’d left me in that
orphanage on my first birthday The
way I see it I’m not wasting an any
tears missing someone who didn’
miss me

And you’re only lying to yourself
f you think your mom was any
dif erent kid Hate to break it to
you but sometimes family gives up
on you and part of being a grown-up
is accepting that

Don’t you talk about my mother

rare

They pivot left to find-- A THIRD NEVERBIRD SCREAMING IN
THEIR FACES ITS BEAK WIDE OPEN BEARING A MOUTHFUL OF RAZOR-
SHARP TEETH

SMEE
Apparently not that rare

PETER
What do we do

The Neverbirds slowly close in on their prey

HOOK
They don’t see many humans They’re
probably more scared of us than we
are of them

The bird closest to Peter pokes its head toward Peter’s face
HISSING at him

PETER
Somehow I doubt that

HOOK
The most important thing to do is
stand your ground and not to-

One SNAPS at Smee who BOLTS screaming hysterically

HOOK (CONT’D)
Run

The lead Neverbird provoked REARS up FLARING its almost
bioluminescent plumage as it emits an EAR-SPLITTING ROAR

How about now

HOOK
RUN NOW RUN

CRUSHING BENEATH THEIR SERRATED TALONS

The Neverbird right behind him EXPLODES throu h the
passway SMASHING the trees in its path enrage
Fuchs 10913 51

ON HOOK-- as he SCRAMBLES for cover SLIDING into a MASSIVE
HOLLOWED LOG Crouched he RACES through it pushing through
tangles of roots when——

CRASH The second Neverbird BURSTS its head through DIRECTLY
in Hook’s path SNAPPING wildly at him Hook falls backward
startled Hook tries to get up as the Neverbird pulls his
head back out of the log but his hand is trapped by the
roots Hook STRAINS against them when--

SK-RASH From directly ABOVE Hook the Neverbird’s TALONS
come back through the log SLASHING downat Hook’s trapped
hand as he SCREAMS -- his eyes reflexively CLENCHING CLOSED
then opens them to see

His hands still there -- the Neverbird’s talon is restrained
by the roots and all he’s done is accidentally slice open the
ones restraining Hook Hook freed PULLS his hand bac

LEAPS up and RACES out of the log as the beast SPLITS through
the rooting and gives chase

BACK ON PETER-- as he SPLASHES through a brook joined by
Smee when they see Hook running toward them

HOOK (CONTD)
Guys Over here

What Hook doesn’t see is the Neverbird right behind him

PETER
Hook behind y-

BOOM Before Peter can even get the word out one of the
beasts is UPON him PULLING him down to the ground Within an
instant Hook and Smee are taken down as we

ON PETER-- as the Neverbird’s GAPING BEAK THRUSTS downward
teeth bared about to SHRED him into pieces when--

THUNK -- an ARROW EXPLODES through the bird’s head the tip
of the arrowhead stopping INCHES from Peters eyeball

Peter shaken PUSHES the dead beast off him to see--

TIGER LILY a strikingly beautiful Native warrior
princess holding a BOW AND ARROW

Without hesitation like a one woman battalion she RELOADS
rapidly firing successive arrows into the birds atop Hook and
Smee before she’s joined by a FIVE MAN NATIVE WAR PARTY
emerging from the trees around her

ONHOOK-- as he slowly stands his eyes connect with Tiger
Lily’s An immediate physical connection The moment broken
as--

SMEE
I think I know a Native phrase or
two Let me handle this
Fuchs 10913 52

Smee smiles politely and says something in a mangled version
of their language The Tallest Warrior looks to Tiger Lily
and then to the rest of their party as they all owly nod
at one another

SMEE (CONTD)
See I told you I’ve got this one
under control boys

Smee smiles proudly

EXT CLIFF VILLAGE - DAY

WE ARE FLYING over the trees of the Neverwood up into the
mountains through the mist to reveal--

The hidden Native rebel base carved into the sheer cliff
faces of the mountains at an elevation of some 8000 feet No
teepees here more like the Anasazi ruins at Mesa Verde This
place is formidable and positively breathtaking

As we PUSH IN on their hidden sanctuary the SOUND OF DRUMS
lo

grows louder and we see the VILLAGERS cking en masse
toward some type of tribal gathering

EXT COMMONSCLIFF VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

An open CENTRAL AREA at the center of which is a MASSIVE FIRE
PIT around which TRIBESMEN AND WOMEN conduct a ceremonial
dance We find our heroes-

BOUND TO A VERTICAL POLE overlooking the pit

SMEE
I know another phrase

HOOK
Smee shut up and stop helping

ON A STONE RISER-- Tiger Lily sits with the TRIBAL ROYALS
between her father the CHIEF a striking proud man
and ATYAN’A her grandmother the village holy woman

PETER
What are they singing about

We see a LARGE WATERMELON-LIKE FRUIT about the size of a
human head placed on an ANVIL

SMEE
Maybe it’s a feast

THWACK As an AXEMAN murders the fruit with an TOMAHAWK
PETER and HOOK

(freaked)
Not a feast
Fuchs 10913 53

The Axeman points to Peter and TWO TRIBESMAN move toward him
Smee starts shouting stuff in their language

PETER
Say something Smee Say something

The tribesmen begin to undo Peter’s ties as the Axeman
sharpens his blade Smee shouts like a madman until finally
he says something and--

A hush falls over the crowd

PETER (CONTD)
Smee what did you just say

Then slowly the villagers begin to chant--

VILLAGERS
PAN PAN PAN

As the DRUMS beat LOUDER the CHANTS grow STRONGER
ON THE TRIBESMEN-- as they leave Peter and instead FREE Hook

HOOK
(perplexed)
Smee What did you say to them

SMEE
Well I invoked the Native rite of
challenge whereby our bravest
warrior
(nods to Hook
Gets to fight theirs

The villagers part as we reveal KIOWA the fiercest

scariest warrior you have ever seen wearing -- literally --
a necklace of human fingers and a WOODEN SPIKE through his
nose This is not the guy you want to mess with -- and Hook

is about to

SMEE (CONTD)
You win We live You lose-

THWACK As the Axemen SPLITS another nevermelon

I get the idea

They TEAR Hook away throwing him toward Kiowa

(re the nose spike)
You know you should really have
that looked at

So how do we know when to st-
Fuchs 10913 54

BAM As Kiowa lands a ROUNDHOUSE BLOW directly into Hook’s
face sending him to the ground

ON PETER-- as he REALIZES something

CU -- as we see the tribesmen neglected to fully re-tie his
hands Peter quickly starts loosening them

BACK ON-- Hook as he grimaces spitting out a tooth looking
up to see Tiger Lily who he’s landed beneath

HOOK (CONTD)
(nods)
Your highness

Kiowa GRABS Hook from behind but Hook-- VWAM Surprises
Kiowa by throwing dirt in his face escaping him

Tiger Lily looks shocked Hook WINKS at her and she GLARES
back embarrassed as--

BOOM Kiowa comes CHARGING into Hook knocking him down All
eyes are on the fight and no one notices as-

Peter SLIPS his hands out of the ties Smee clocks it Peter
holds a finger to his lips and quietly undoes Smee’s ties

ON HOOK-- as he and Kiowa now circle before CHARGING at one
another It’s brutal hand to hand combat but somehow Hook --
outsized and out-matched -- holds his own BAM Blow after
blow BAM Hook is staying on his feet bloodied but like
Maximus in the Colosseum surviving on sheer GUTS alone

ON PETER and SMEE-- as they furtively sneak around the
perimeter of the erstwhile ‘ring’ unnoticed

BACK ON THE FIGHT-- as the tide turns in Hook’s favor Tiger
Lily’ s breath seems to quicken She almost seems to be
rooting for him Kiowa NOTICES the connection this time rage
SWELLING in his eyes

HOOK (CONTD)
It’s not what it looks 1li-

Now Kiowa is a man possessed He GRABS Hook by the torso
SPINNING him and then SLAMMING him to the ground with a THUD

On Hook dodging BLOWS as he spins on the ground until-- BAM
One connects with his face And then ANOTHER BAM And
ANOTHER BAM And suddenly the tide has turned and Hook is
being pummeled out of existence

ON PETER-- he sees Hook’s about to die He doesn’t know what
to do seems torn when--

THWUNK SOMEONE TACKLES HIM AND HE GOES DOWN HARD HIS HEAD
HITTING THE DUST AS HIS NECKLACE GOES FLYING

Looks up to see- a pissed off Tiger Lily

ON KIOWA-- he RAISES his fist ready to land the killer blow
Fuchs 10913 55

Hook FLINCHES bloodied bracing for the death blow when--
We HEAR a LONE VOICE CRY OUT

We don’t understand it but everyone stops CHANTING and turns
to see Aiyan’ a the holy woman who REPEATS it as she POINTS
to Peter’s necklace lying on the ground

And as the people of the village see it-- ONE BY ONE BY ONE
THEY ALL BOW UNTIL WE PULL WIDE TO REVEAL EVERY SINGLE
MEMBER OF THE TRIBE ON THEIR KNEES PROSTRATE BEFORE PETER
AND THE NECKLACE

The Chief is the only one standing He walks toward Peter

Who are you

Peter hesitates Hook eyes him nods

I’m Peter I’m think I’m the one
you’ve been waiting for

ON BLACKBEARD-- as he slowly makes his way through the crash
site Turks approaches

TURK
We searched the ship twice over
The only thing they took was a map

Blackbeard frowns

getting off this island

BLACKBEARD
What if he doesn’t want to get off

He’s a kid all alone in the woods

INT CAVE - NIGHT
Blackness until-

TIGER LILY (0S)
Look

VWOOSH The FLAMES of a torch illuminate a primitive but
beautiful cave drawing Reverse to see

Peter taking it all in Aiyana speaks in her native language
and Tiger Lily holding the torch translates

TIGER LILY (CONTD)
It was a time of war

We see crude drawings of the PIRATES hunting the NATIVES

TIGER LILY (CONTD)
Blackbeard and his men destroyed
everything in pursuit of the
dust

We see Blackbeard leading the pirates on a scorched earth
march across the Neverwood

TIGER LILY feontP) D)
But then my father made a pact with
the great Fairy King uniting our

peoples as one against the pirates

We see the Natives AMBUSHING the pirates in tandem with
LITTLE WHITE DOTS that SWARM around the bad guys

TIGER LILY (CONTD)
The fairies could go where we could
not Find the pirates’ weaknesses
Help us win the war

We see ONE WHITE DOT sneaking into the dust mines

TIGER LILY (CONT’D)
The King’s favorite son and heir
was the bravest among his people
The prince snuck into the pirates’
camps in the dead of night And
when he did he found something he
didn’t expect

The WHITE LIGHT GROWS MORE INTENSE
TIGER LILY (CONTD)
Something that would change
everything

And we see a drawing of a slave girl with a face weve seen
before Fiercely beautiful Piercing blue eyes
Fuchs 10913 57

TIGER LILY (CONTD)
Her name was Mary The prince led
her out of the camps Showed her
the way out of the darkness

We see the LITTLE WHITE LIGHT guiding Mary to safety through
cracks in the as-yet-unfinished Wall

TIGER LILY (CONTD)
The girl wished to thank her hero
but had nothing more to offer than
a kiss To receive his reward the
prince took human form

We see a MAGICAL TRANSFORMATION AS THE WHITE DOT FLARES and
when the light clears we see- a HANDSOME HUMAN PRINCE

TIGER LILY (CONTD)
The prince and the slave girl fell
in love But though fairies can
live many thousands of years in
the flesh of man they can live only
from one sunrise to the next And
so the prince sacrificed his entire
life to spend one single day with
the human woman he loved And the
product of that love

Aiyana pokes Peter in the chest

TIGER LILY (CONTD)

Was you

(then
Word of your birth spread quickly
Whispers -- rumors -- that the

prophesy had been realized The
pirates hunted you mercilessly and
so your mother turned to the only
ones who could protect her baby To
us

PETER
You-- she knew my mother

TIGER LILY
Our people helped your mother to
escape to hide you from Blackbeard
in another world And my
grandmother made for you a totem
so that when you returned we would
know it was you by this this

symbol
We see a massive drawing of the pipe

PETER
My necklace
(then)
Does she know what became of my
mother Where she is
Fuchs 10913 58

TIGER LILY
She says your mother returned to
the Neverwood and joined the
rebellion Fought as a great
warrior

PETER
My mother was a warrior

TIGER LILY
The bravest warrior we had ever
seen The Pan

PE
The Pan Is that what they were
chanting

TIGER LILY

The bravest warrior of our tribe we
call the Pan Kiowa-Pan who fought
your friend is the bravest of our

tribe now as your mother once was

PETER
Was

TIGER LILLY
Your mother left our village Just
as your father gave his life for
her your mother devoted her life
to protecting his people The
pirates were on the verge of wiping
out the last of the fairies And so
the King and all who remained went
into hiding until a time when they
could reveal themselves once more
They lie deep in the Neverwood
still a hidden Fairy Kingdom Your
mother remains with them
Protecting them To this day

Peter’s eyes widen

PETER
Wait you mean- she’s alive Are
you sure

Tiger Lily looks to Aiyana who nods Peter’s eyes brim with
tears He’s overwhelmed with motion

PETER (CONTD)
I have to go to her You have to
take me I want to leave now I-

TIGER LILY
Patience

PETER
My mother’s out there right now
wondering why her son hasnt
already come for her Do you
understand that
Fuchs 10913 59

TIGER LILY

No It is you who does not
understand The location of the
hidden Fairy Kingdom is the great
secret of my people The fairies
and their energy are the lifeblood
of this island Everything here
the plants the animals feed off
their magic as we feed off the
land If the last of the fairies
dies the island itself and our
people die along with it The lost
Kingdom is the last and only hope
for the future of Neverland

(then)
There is a map Hidden in these
tunnels but I cannot reveal it to
you until you have proved you are
the boy the prophets foretold

Off Peter’s face- overwhelmed so close and still so far

EXT CLIFF VILLAGE - NIGHT

As Peter frustrated exits the caves with Tiger Lily and
Aiyan’a As they walk up a rocky pathway back to the camp-

PETER
I have the pipe I don’t understand
what more you need to see

Aiyan’a shouts something and Tiger Lily stops Peter

Aiyan’a circles around standing in front of him then
reaches out and places her hand on his face

TIGER LILY

She Says you do not need to prove
it to her or to the tribe She says
worry only about proving it to
yourself You do not yet believe
But when you do so will they

(then
She says she can feel the fear
inside you but that you do not
need to fear

Aiyana takes Peter’s hand holding it tightlyand smiles

TIGER LILY (CONTD)
That as the prince le our mother
out of darkness so shall you his
only son lead us into the light

PULL WIDE TO SEE Peter standing there with two generations

Peter enters to find Hook pacing Smee seated on a cot

PETER

I can stay here as long as we like

PETER

Hook GRABS Peter as he passes

HOOK
Not brilliant I want out of here
So whatever they ask you to do --

PETER
Don’t worry You’ll get your pixum

Peter shoves Hook off him and heads to the back of the room

HOOK
Flyboy
(Peter turns)
Are you who they think you are

ETER
I know that they knew my mother
The symbol on the wall matches m
necklace It would explain why
left me why she hadn’t come back

HOOK

hal fairy reak show kid They

(then)
Are they right

PETER

EXT NEVERWOOD - DAY

Reveal Those aren’t DRUMS- were in the MIDDLE of a STAMPEDE
of NEVERBEASTS (wildebeest-like in morphology elephantine in
scale) These things are big but man can they can MOVE

ANGLE ON A LOW RIDGE OVERLOOKING THE MIGRATION-- Tiger Lily
Kiowa and Peter edge forward carefully

TIGER LILY
If you’re going to lead us into
battle you must first learn to
prove yourself as a warrior
(then)
Watch

Kiowa steps to the edge of the ridge Waits for it and then-

PROPELS HIMSELF OFF THE RIDGE ONTO THE BACK OF A GALLOPING
NEVERBEAST THE NEVERBEAST FREAKS OUT FOR A SECOND AND THEN
KIOWA WHISPERS INTO ITS EAR AND SUDDENLY-- HES RIDING THE
THING

TIGER LILY (CONTD)

The trick is to feel their motion
Everything on this island is
interconnected Us the animals
even the pirates You can ‘t defend
the land unless you recognize you
are the land -- and the land is
you

(then)
Now you go

Peter looks down at the migration

PETER
Oh no -- ladies first

TIGER LILY
(stares back)
Go
Peter hesitates before-- BOOM Tiger Lily PUSHES him off

PETER SCREAMS AS HE FALLS LANDING ON THE BACK OF A BOUNDING
NEVERBEAST

Peter HOLDS ON for dear life his hands GRASPING at the
beast’s FUR

PETER
One with the beast One with the-
His hand CLASPS onto one of the beast’s HORNS and--

WITH A COLOSSAL ROAR THE NEVERBEAST THRASHES ITS NECK AND
HURLS PETER OFF AS--

VWOOM TIGER LILY SCOOPS HIM UP TOSSING HIM ONTO THE BACK OF
HER NEVERBEAST

HOOK
Blackbeard’s extended the Wall all
the way to the shore in this
direction

(makes a line)

But on the other side he’s been
building an armada In secret
Hundreds of ships Like nothing
I’ve ever seen

Kiowa turns to Tiger Lily and the Chief

KIOWA
Even if Blackbeard found us he
wouldn’t need that many
reinforcements It doesn’t make
sense

TIGER LILY
That many ships Those aren’t
reinforcements
(considers then)
Thats an invasion force

HOOK
An invasion of what

EXT ARCHERY RANGECLIFF VILLAGE - DAY

THUNK As an ARROW connects CRUDE WOODEN TARGET Reverse to

EXT TREE PILLBOXNEVERWOOD - DAY

Tiger Lily and Hook climb up a massive nevertree en route to
a lookout post

TIGER LILY
From the look-out I want you to
show us where you saw the air-
Galleons docked and-

A branch CRACKS under her and she FALLS into Hook’s arms as
he CATCHES her

HOOK
Woah You alright there

TIGER LILY
Let go of me

She practically JUMPS away from him Hook’s visibly insulted
by her reaction

HOOK
Oh excuse me I’m sure human
contact can be very jarring to
royalty like yourself your
highness

She GLARES at him

TIGER LILY
I don’t have a problem with human
contact

Hook raises a suggestive eyebrow at that with a twinkle in
his eye Tiger Li 4 opens her mouth offended About to say
something back just as- Kiowa JOINS them on the branch

KIOWA
Everything okay

TIGER LILY HOOK
Fine Peachy

Kiowa nods Suspicious You can cut the weird energy with a
knife He keeps moving and Hook and Tiger Lily follow

HOOK
After you princess

Tiger Lily and Kiowa are ignoring him looking the opposite
way Hook turns to see- MASSIVE PLUMES OF SMOKE a FOREST
FIRE RAGING

PUSH OUT OVER THE WOODS DEEPER INTO THE BLACK SMOKE AND WE

LONG SPEAR as she and Peter watch KIOWA and another WARRIOR
go at it

TIGER LILY
A warrior has to master the way of

ON THE TWO WARRIORS-—- as they do battle It’s a stunning
combination of Philippine Eskrima (blade fighting) and
Brazilian capoeira
Tiger Lily hands Peter a SMALL DAGGER She raises her spear

TIGER LILY (CONT’D)
Come at me

Peter looks down at the dagger

PETER
Wait -- how come you get a spear
Fuchs 10913 65

Before he can even look up- TIGER LILY IS CHARGING AT HIM
WITH A VICIOUS ROAR Peter DUCKS escapes a THRUST or two
even BLOCKING a hit with his smail dagger before Tiger Lily
SWEEPS his legs out from beneath him with the spear

ON PETER-- flat on the ground Tiger Lily’s spear-point to
his throat

PETER (CONTD)
Hey That wasn’t fair

TIGER LILY
You think the pirates fight fair

Peter stands furious

PETER
Enough My mother is out there She
needs me You think I can
concentrate on this knowing that

TIGER LILY
You dishonor your mother by blaming
her for your failure

PETER
You want me to lead you You want
me to fight Take me to her Until
then I won’t fight for you or
anybody

He STABS his dagger into the rock

ON TIGER LILY-- as she watches him go Kiowa joins her They
speak in their native language the dialogue subtitled

KIOWA
What if you’re wrong about him
What if they are spies What if
this was a trap to find our base
and-

TIGER LILY
Stop it We can trust them We can
trust them
Kiowa sighs
KIOWA
When are you going to tell him
everything He has to know

TIGER LILY
Not yet When he’s ready

We see determination in her eyes but also sadness

EXT CLIFF VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Peter passes Hook on his way to their hut
Fuchs 10913 66

HOOK
Where do you think you’re going

Peter stops near tears

PETER
These things they expect me to
doI can’t do them Hook

HOOK
What are you talking about What
happened

PETER

Theyre going to find out Theyre
going to see I’m not their bloody
messiah that I’m just- me

HOOK
Hey Stop Stop it Listen

Hook takes a deep breath Peter doesn’t even look at him

HOOK (CONTD)

I don’t know what you are I know
that you flew Maybe you got some
dust on you maybe you are half
fairy maybe it was a once in a
lifetime miracle I don’t know

But I knew you were different
before that In the mines when you
stood up for that girl

Peter’s eyes lock with Hook’s

HOOK (CONTD)
That was a brave thing you did It
was probably what I should have
one

Hook shrugs

HOOK (CONTD)
Does that mean you’ re the One I
don’t know I don’t know if there
is a ‘One’ But I do know that if
you aren’t “the guy -- if you are
just youmaybe that’s enough

Peter looks moved Hook gets uncomfortable immediately shuts
back down

HOOK (CONTD)
Look kid you want to find your

hand-to-hand combat as the village’s warriors make their
futile last stand fighting tooth and nail against the

owering to the ground a WALL OF PIRATES led by Turk

disembark guns still smoking

Hook and Tiger Lily freeze Caught The wall of pirates parts
to reveal-

Blackbeard steps off the ship All around them the pirates
are wiping out the last gasps of resistance as Blackbeard
moves closer

He asks what if he does not tell
you

BLACKBEARD

(cocks the gun)
Let’s just hope he does

Gun raised to his chest the Chief pauses his eyes locked
with Blackbeard’s He finally responds

TIGER LILY

He says death is the greatest
adventure

Blackbeard doesn’t react then-

Bon voyage

BAM ON PETER’S FACE-- as we hear a GUNSHOT and Tiger Lil
scream Peter looks around panicked when- he HEARS something
behind him He turns parting the leaves to reveal a
NEVERBEAST grazing in the woods behind him

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)
Need I repeat myself

ON PETER-- as he STEPS toward the beast carefully As he
gets closer he sees another TWO NEVERBEASTS grazing behind
itand a SMALL HERD behind that

And we see in Peter’s desperate eyes an idea forming

ON TIGER LILY-- who stoically shakes her head

TIGER LILY
No You don’t

She closes her eyes Spreads her arms and quietly prays
HOOK
Hey What are you doing Tell him

ready to fire again when-

HOOK (CONTD)
Theres a map

Blackbeard looks to Hook

and the animal REARS up HURLING Peter off

He PUSHES himself off the ground to find--

Hello Peter

VWAM Peter SPINS away as Blackbeard’s sword SLAMS into the
ground He LEAPS off the floor pulling his DAGGER out

The two circle one another blades drawn as the mountain
base begins to crumble under sustained cannon-fire all around

irony Peter

You’1l never find her And do you
know why

Blackbeard LUNGES toward Peter knocking his DAGGER out of
his hand pressing Peter to the rocky wall behind him

ON BLACKBEARD-- as he raises his SWORD to Peter’s neck

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)
Because I killed her

Peter’s face pales

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)
Because she died at my hand with
this very blade

PETER
No No no no

Peter’s eyes well up with tears Rage coursing through his
veins as Blackbeard presses the blade harder into his throat

BLACKBEARD
Just like you’re about to

Tears stream down Peter’s face Blackbeard shakes his head
He RAISES the sword

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)
Don’t cry Your mother didn’t Die

and think of a happy thought

Peter shuts his eyes and Blackbeard brings the blade down as-

VWOOM HOOK COMES BARRELING INTO BLACKBEARD LIKE A HUMAN

Almost

The ROCKS are almost upon them as they finally race around a
bend to see-

A MOUNTAIN RIVER-PASS FLOWING OVER THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF INTO
A SPECTACULAR WATERFALL -- AND THEY’RE RACING RIGHT TOWARD
THE DROP

Peter looks to Hook and then back to Tiger Lily
Fuchs 10913 82

PETER
Where’s that

EXT RIVERNEVERWOOD - DAY
We’re MOVING RAPIDLY over water

TIGER LILY (0S)
My people call it Na’afi Kuguri In
your words Mermaid Lagoon

We keep PUSHING DOWN-RIVER until we find a MAKESHIFT RAFT
floating downstream with our three heroes on it

As they make their way downstream Tiger Lily sharpens a
SPEAR made from branches with a pointed rock attached at the
end Peter sits at the edge of the raft his feet dangling in
the water

PETER
Mermaid Lagoon That’ s the one
place the pirates won’t go

Tiger Lily nods and hands Peter the spear She starts working
on another one

PETER (CONTD)
The pirates are afraid of mermaids

TIGER LILY
No They’re afraid of what you have
to pass through to get there
Hook fashioning his own spear smiles at Peter
HOOK
You’re not afraid of a few crocs
are you Peter

Hook smiles Peter pulls his feet out of the water

INT CAVESCLIFF VILLAGE - DAY
Turk leads a small pirate search party deeper into the caves

TURK
It’s got to be here somewhere Keep
looking

ON SMEE-- as he branches off down a side tunnel holding a
torch We TRACK him down the tunnel until we see his eyes
widen and a smile appear as he sees something

SMEE
Blimey

MOMENTS LATER-- Smee hurriedly LEADS Blackbeard Turk and a
group of PIRATES back to the spot
Fuchs 10913 83

SMEE (CONTD)
Captain I think--

Smee raises his torch to reveal on the wall THE MAP TO THE
FAIRY KINGDOM

SMEE (CONTD)
You’re going to be very happy

Blackbeard his face illuminated by Smee’s torchlight leans
forward taking in the map

BLACKBEARD

Mr Turk -- I want you to load up
an air-Galleon with as many slaves
as it can carry and bring them--

(points to the X on the

map )
Here And then I want you to fill
another ship and another and
another As fast as you can

Any particular kind of slave sir
BLACKBEARD
Diggers Give me diggers
EXT CROC ALLEYNEVERWOOD - NIGHT

Our heroes continue their riverine journey to Mermaid Lagoon
Several MAKE-SHIFT TORCHES are wedged into the flooring of
the raft

ON PETER-- staring out at the woods his head still somewhere
else Hook sits down next to him

HOOK
You okay
PETER
Do you care
HOOK
(honest)

No No I don’t

Peter turns to him

PETER
When you got the telegram that
our mum had died -- how did you

keep going
Fuchs 10913

I don’t know At a certain age you
get to a place where enough bad
stuff res te and enough good stuff
doesn’t at you accept your life
isn’t going to be what you imagined
it would be You grow up And you
keep going becauseyou have to

ANGLE ON THE WATER-- as SEVERAL ROWS OF FIN-LIKE REPTILIAN
SCALES silently break the surface of the river Unseen by our

heroes they SNAKE toward the raft

HOOK (CONTD)

Happy endings are for story books
but story books are for kids
Peter You can’t stay a kid
forever Even in Neverland

Peter considers this when-

TIGER LILY
Hayathu

Peter and Hook jump up

PETER
What did she say

As they spin to see behind them--

THE GAPING JAWS OF AN 8 TON NEVER-CROC EMERGE FROM THE WATER

Peter and Hook stumble backward as the croc dives back down

swimming underneath the raft

TIGER LILY

Grab the torches They’re afraid of

the flame

HOOK

Were going to be alright kid As

long it’s only one of them

PETER
Uh -- Hook

Hook traces Peter’s gaze to see-- the telltale SCALES of

another Never-Croc breaking the surface

from the other direction

HOOK
Alright that’s not great
then

Get J torch kid What are you

standing around for

coming right at them

Peter GRABS a torch as our three heroes move back-to-back
torches at the ready A beat No sign of them
Fuchs 10913 85

PETER
Did we scare them off

VWOOM ONE OF THE CROCS EXPLODES DOLPHIN LIKE OUT OF THE
WATER FLYING OVER THE RAFT ILLUMINATED BY THEIR TORCHES WE
GOT OUR FIRST GOOD LOOK AT THIS THING WHICH RESEMBLES THE
FAMED CRETACEOUS-ERA SARCOSUCHUS (SUPER CROC”) MORE THAN
ANYTHING ELSE

PETER (CONTD)
Jesus

(as it SPLASHES down)
They can fly

They ¢3 can’t Ply but they can sure
ell jump Keep waving that
thing ‘donee

The second croc EXPLODES out of the river SOARING over them
and splashing down The WAVES beneath the raft are building

PETER
They’re trying to knock us overbo-

WHAM A WAVE TILTS UP THE END OF THE RAFT PETER’S STANDING ON
AND- SPLASH HE GOES HEADFIRST INTO THE WATER DISAPPEARING
BENEATH THE SURFACE

HOOK
Peter PETER

TIGER LILY
Whered he go

HOOK
He went down I think I see him

Hook kneels down thrusting his arm into the water

HOOK (CONTD)
Grab my hand Take it

And then-- we see Hook JERK downward and his face PALE as he
realizes something’s got him He TRIES to pull his hand back
ut can’t

HOOK (CONTD)
I need some help Help

Tiger Lily races over and STRAINS topull Hook out As she
PULLS him back onto the raft he pulls out with him--

TIGER LILY
Peter

Our hero gasping for air

PETER
It had me But it let go
Fuchs 10913 86

Hook looks up to see the Never-Croc scales disappearing into
the other direction just as--

HOOK
What are they running from

As- a light ILLUMINATES his face distorted from beneath the

water

He looks down to see beneath the surface

The bioluminescent outline of the sexiest most beautiful
MERMAID you have ever seen Her porcelain skin literally
glows as if it were its own light source

ON PETER-- as he spots another one on his side

PETER
Are these--

TIGER LILY
Mermaids These are sacred
creatures Even the crocodiles will
not harm them

PETER
Theyre so

Peter is completely consumed by their beauty Hook nods

Tiger

Tiger

HOOK
You can say that again

Lily makes a dismissive noise Hook eyes her

HOOK (CONTD)
Problem

Lily ignores him turns to Peter

TIGER LILY
They’re giving us safe passage

PETER
Why’s that

TIGER LILY
Because mermaids are creatures of
the mind They can read our
thoughtsand they must feel we
have something worth protecting

Tiger Lily eyes Peter Peter just turns away As we PULL WIDE

to see

The raft surrounded by a POD OF MERMAIDS escorting them to

safety
Fuchs 10913 87

EXT MERMAID LAGOON - NIGHT

It’s night but the MERMAIDS swimming beneath the surface
illuminate the subterranean lagoon in a kaleidoscope of
colors so bright it could be the middle of the day

ON OUR HERO RAFT-- as it makes its way into the lagoon
passing a SHIP WRECK on the shore

TIGER LILY
Theyll protect us here for as long
as we need them to

As they speak the raft makes landfall docking at a natural
harbor on the perimeter of the lagoon

HOOK
I’m going to check out that wreck
See if there’s anything worth
salvaging

Hook hops off raft and heads toward the ship leaving Peter
alone with Tiger Lily

TIGER LILY
I’m sorry I did not tell you what
happened to your mother -- but
Blackbeard did not tell you the
whole truth either

PETER
I don’t understand

TIGER LILY
Let me show you

PETER
Show me

Tiger Lily nods
MOMENTS LATER-- Peter and Tiger Lily are in the water

TIGER LILY
Because of the mermaids the waters
here are charged with their a’shana
-- their energy You can see
through my eyes Are you ready

Peter takes a deep breath

PETER
I’m ready

TIGER LILY
Hold your breath

And with that Tiger Lily PLACES her hand on Peter’s face
begins to PRAY and then DUNKS him into the water like he’s
being baptized
Fuchs 10913 88

ON PETER’S FACE-- his eyes close and the minute he’s
submerged we are instantly TRANSPORTED TO

EXT NEVERWOOD - DAYFLASHBACK

VWOOSH The images LAND into view like those in Dumbledore’s
Pensieve

Were FLYING OVER AND THROUGH an epic battle between the

pirates on the one side and the Natives and fairies on the
other Every so often the image ripples like its projected
over water A fierce clash but it clear the pirates are

winning
TIGER LILY (VO)
We fought with our fairy brothers
but we could not reverse the
tide
ON A SMALL BEAUTIFUL NATIVE GIRL -- as she watches the

battle terrified

TIGER LILY
I saw it all And I watched as your
mother did what thirty men coul
not

We see Mary dressed as a native warrior her hair crop ed
short and a virtual master in the martial art of ts’kali

TIGER LILY (CONTD)
And it was still not enough The
last of the Fairy Kingdom was on
the verge of devastation

In her eyes we see she knows this is the end

TIGER LILY (CONTD)
And so your mother told the Fairy
King and his people to retreat To
disappear into the woods That she
would hold off Blackbeard as long
as she could

ON MARY-- as she and Blackbeard go one on one An epic sword
fight between two titans

TIGER LILY (CONTD)
Until

Blackbeard gets the advantage and-- we only see glimpses of
what happens next

Mary’s eyes WIDENINGher sword FALLINGBlackbeard’s face
filled with hate

ANGLE ON MARY-- lies dying as the WHITE LIGHTS of the fairies
intensify around her
Fuchs 10913 89

TIGER LILY (CONT’D)
She sacrificed herself to protect
the Kingdom But in so doing
something extraordinary happened

We see the white lights the fairies around Mary rotating
around her faster and faster Until they flare--

A MASSIVE WHITE EXPLOSION OF LIGHT SHOOTS OUT FROM MARY
BLINDING US- AND WHEN OUR VISION CLEARS

EXT MERMAID LAGOON - NIGHTPRESENT

Tiger Lily PULLS Peter’s head out of the water He catches
his breat

TIGER LILY
In death she found new life She
became a part of the island Her
itu-awai her life force still
protects the secret of the kingdom
It pushes away all who seek to
destroy it and has kept them hidden
all these years She is what has
kept them safe

PETER
I don’t understand

TIGER LILY
Your mother isn’t really gone
Peter But if what she gave her
life to protect is destroyed
what’s left of her will be
destroyed with it

Peter shakes his head wading back onto dry land

PETER
What if I can’t do what she did
What if I fail

TIGER LILY

If you don’t try if you don’t
fight -- then you have already
failed And Blackbeard has already
won

As Peter considers this-

HOOK
Hey

They turn to see Hook approaching

HOOK (CONTD)
(smiles )
You’re not going to believe what I
found
Fuchs 10913

EXT MERMAID LAGOON - MOMENTS LATER
ON HOOK-- as he LEADS them toward the shipwreck

HOOK
The hull’s pretty banged up Looks
like teeth marks Apparent y those
crocs can jump pretty high but

Hook makes his way to the back of the ship toward the
engine which he opens to reveal-

HOOK (CONTD)
Get a load of this

The engine is filled with pixum Hook beams
HOOK (CONTD)
If I can fix that hull -- and I can
-- it should be enough
TIGER LILY
Enough for what
HOOK
To get us the hell off this island
Peter turns away Conflicted
TIGER LILY

After everything you want to run
like a coward

HOOK
I mean I hadn’t thought of it in
those exact terms but generally
speakingyes

Hook laughs Tiger Lily doesn’t Peter just stares at the

water

HOOK (CONTD)
Good grief I thought you two would
be thrilled

Tiger Lily shakes her head

TIGER LILY
So that’s it You’ll go home

HOOK

Listen princess I don’t like
Blackbeard any more than the next
miner but this fight’s over Your
base is gone Whoever survived the
attack is probably in a camp by
now

(then)
I’ve been in those camps I’m not
going back Not for anything
Or anyone
Fuchs 10913 91

TIGER LILY
You know as well as I do what
Blackbeard‘s planning Those ships
That invasion force He’s coming
for your world And if he gets to
the hidden kingdom he’1ll have all
the dust he needs to actually do
it You want to go home You won’t
have a home to go back to if we
don’t stop him

HOOK
That’s a guess

TIGER LILY
It’s more than a guess

HOOK
(shrugs)
Great at least I’1l die later We
fight him now we’re all dead and
you know it

Tiger Lily keeps herself together but we can see she’s hurt

TIGER LILY
If you have no reason to stay then
go

HOOK

Oh don’t go mushy on me now your
Highness

TIGER LILY
If you can leave us to die--

I don’t want you to die I want you
to come with me

TIGER LILY
And if I don’t
HOOK
Then that’s your decision Not

mine

Tiger Lily glares at him and walks away leaving Peter alone
with Hook

HOOK (CONTD)
Looks like it’s just you and me
kid You name the place and I’‘1l
take you there just so long as
it’s out of here

Peter hesitates

HOOK (CONTD)
What do you say
Fuchs 10913 92
Hook extends his hand Peter takes a deep breath

EXT MERMAID LAGOON - MOMENTS LATER

ON TIGER LILY-- she sits her feet dangling in the water when
she hears something and turns to see-

Peter walking toward her

PETER
Let’s get one thing straight I’m
not the Chosen One The prophesy
wasn’t about me if it was ever real
at all and the sooner you get gur
mind around that fact the bet
off we’ll all be

Tiger Lily’s face falls

PETER (CONTD)
But I am my mother’s son And if
Blackbeard is going to destroy
everything my parents died for
then I’m going to stand against him
to the last Just like they did

Peter’s blue eyes -- his mother’s eyes -- seem to burn more
fiercely than we’ve ever seen before

PETER (CONT’D)
Any questions

TIGER LILY
Why are we still standing here

Peter smiles

EXT KINGDOM MINE - DAY

AERIAL SHOT as we SWEEP OVER a dustmine that’s only in its
nascent stages MINERS are being unloaded by the shipload and
RUSHED into the dig A rapid and massive mobilization of

manpower that would put the builders of the ancient pyramids
o shame

ON THE GROUND-- Blackbeard marches through the camp with Turk
and Smee in tow

TURK
We should have two hundred more
here by noon Captain And another
two hundred after that by
nightfall

BLACKBEARD
Keep them coming Any sign of the
boy
Fuchs 10913 93

TURK
Not yet sir Nothing

SMEE
All due respect sir I’ve spent
some time with the boy and I
promise you you’ve got nothing to
worry about

BLACKBEARD
And why is that

SMEE
He’s weak He’s afraid And what’s
more none of the people believe in
him Not anymore

BLACKBEARD
Let’s keep it that way

As they enter--

INT BLACKBEARD’S TENT - CONTINUOUS

Tables are set up with maps lain out It looks like a forward
military command base

Turk leads Blackbeard to the center table

TURK
Captain if you look over here we
have some of the plans you’d
requested

Blackbeard leans over the table taking it all in Smee
looking over his shoulder eyes the maps on the table and his
eyes widen

Smee’s POV these aren’t maps of Neverland They’re maps of
London New York Moscow Tokyo

SMEE
My god

BLACKBEARD
Do we have a problem

SMEE
No no not at all sir Its
justhow are you going to pull
off something like this On this
scale

BLACKBEARD
We have eyes and ears in their
world Mr Smee And theirs is a
world now in chaos A great war is
being Fought by all against all
Their world has never been more
ripe for the taking
Fuchs 10913

Blackbeard turns back to the maps

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)

The dust of a freshly slaughtered
fairy is infinitely more powerful
than the bones of a long dead one
Once we have the pixum to fuel our
armada -- there will be nothing
that can stop us

(then)
Do you know why they called me a
pirate Mr Smee Because I did the
Crown’s dirty work I did more
damage to the Spanish and French
fleets in a decade than the Royal
Navy had in a century and didn’t
get so much as a thank you No
Instead I became a lia itity I
made the world safe for the Crown
and in exchange the Crown made the
world safe from men like me

SMEE
If you don’t mind my asking why do
you want to go back This place is
ike Eden

Blackbeard shakes his head

BLACKBEARD

This place isn’t paradise It’s a
prison A pixum gilded cage Like
Napoleon on Elba I long for home
I yearn for the world I was chased
from My world Mr Smee

(smiles)
And now after all this time when
they least expect it I’m going to
take it back

EXT HILLTOPNEVERWOOD - DAY

ANGLE ON THE KINGDOM MINE-- from a distance Reveal

Peter and Tiger Lily surveilling the mine from a nearby
hilltop

PETER
He’s practically emptying out the
camps to find this place

TIGER LILY
With that many diggers it’s not
going to take him long

PETER
I’1l say

Tiger Lily turns and begins to walk down the side of the
hill Peter follows

Fuchs 10913 95

PETER (CONTD)
What are you thinking

TIGER LILY
Were outnumbered We’re outgunned
The chances of success are slim

PETER
You really know how to give a good
pep talk

TIGER LILY

If were going to stop Blackbeard
we’re not going to be able to do it
alone

PETER

Well yes an army would be quite
nice but how do you suppose we
raise one and get it here in time

Tiger Lily thinks
TIGER LILY
Maybe Blackbeard’s already done
that part for us

Peter follows her gaze to see she’s staring at the ship-loads
of miners being unloaded into the camps

PETER
Brilliant

EXT KINGDOM MINE - DAY

ON A ROW OF MINERS-- as they file into camp among them

Peter and Tiger Lily They blend perfectly into the sea of
humanity coursing into the mine

TIGER LILY

tribe

Peter nods As we hear-

Peter turns to see the Skinny Orphan he stood up for back in
the Kensington Home staring back at him Shocked

SKINNY ORPHAN (CONTD)
It is you What are you doing here

Peter holds his finger to his lips and keeps walking The
skinny orphan keeps pace
Fuchs 10913 96

PETER
When did you get here

SKINNY ORPHAN
Oh I was on the first shipment in
yesterda morning Won’t tell
anyone what we’‘re digging for but
everyone says it’s something big
Something different

INT TUNNELSKINGDOM MINE - MOMENTS LATER

ANGLE ON SMEE-- he looks nervous Sweating profusely The
miners around him stand in tangibly worried silence

BLACKBEARD
(approaches )
What seems to be the issue Mr
Smee

SMEE
Captain sir weve followed the
cave map Hook told us about to the
letter And according to the map
the entrance to the kingdom shoould
be right here butwell see for
yourself--

Instead of an entryway we see- a MASSIVE IMPENETRABLE WALL
decorated with row after row of ILLEGIBLE HIEROGLYPHIC-LIKE
CARVINGS and STRANGE INDENTATIONS

BLACKBEARD
Fascinating

Blackbeard touches his hand to the wall

TURK
Weve been trying to to dig through
it sir but no lu

BLACKBEARD
I don’t know what’s on the other
side of this wall but to get to
the hidden kingdom I know we have
to get through it The map is
clear Are these tunnels wide
enough to send in an air-Galleon

TURK
Indeed they are sir

BLACKBEARD
Then bring one down here and blast
this thing open with the long guns
I want us through to the other side
by sun up If the wall’s not gone
by then mark my words one of you
will be

With that Blackbeard turns and exits
TURK
You heard the captain Let’s MOVE

When into the center of the room walks Ayain’a and Tiger
Lily Everyone falls silent

AYAIN’A

(subtitles)
My people this is our darkest
hour Blackbeard is almost upon the
hidden kingdom and when he finds
it all will be lost Desperate
times call for desperate measures
and so I ask you to listen to this

Believe in him as his mother

elieved in us

With that Peter EMERGES from the crowd to a chilly response

TRIBESMAN 1
That boy is the reason we’re in
here

TRIBESMAN 2
He and his friends revealed us to
the pirates

TRIBESMAN 3
We cannot trust him

AYAINA

SILENCE

Everyone shuts up Peter has the floor He looks to Tiger
Lily next to him who nods encouragingly

TIGER LILY
(whispers in his ear)
Make them believe

PETER
Hi

Tiger Lily translates Everyone just stares back

PETER (CONTD)
I know that some of you blame me
for what has happened but you need
to know that was not my fault
Smee a man I thought was a friend
betrayed me but I never betrayed
you Do you understand

People seem unimpressed

PETER (CONTD)
Look to be honest I don’t know
what I’m doing I’ m not a warrior
I’m certainly not what you were
expecting butI’m what you got
And I know that if we don’t stand
up together like my mum did like
my dad did that we wont get
another chance This is it

(MORE)
Fuchs 10913 99

PETER (CONTD)
And so whatever you believe about
me or don’tI’m not asking you to
fight for me

(thinks )
I’m asking you to fight with me
Because I can’t do this alone But
if we stand together those miners
out there will stand with us and
then guess what we have the
numbers Not them Us We are as
strong as we choose to be

Everyone CHATTERS quietly among themselves The speech is
having an impact

PETER (CONTD)
Let us choose to be strong Let us
choose to be brave It’s what my
mother would’ve asked of you then
It’s what I beg of you now

Ayain’a smiles watching the room take this all in Tiger Lily
looks to Peter impressed

TIGER LILY
This is what you called ‘pep’ talk
(she nods)
You are better at it

Peter smiles Tiger Lily turns to her people

TIGER LILY (CONTD)
So I stand with Peter Who else
stands with me

The villagers continue to confer when--

MAN (0S)
I have a question

All eyes turn to see-- KIOWA alive but badly wounded dimp
into the center of the room Tiger Lily reacts shocked to
see him

KIOWA

You ask us to fight with you To
rise up To risk our lives But
what makes you different You lied
to us before and because of it our
people died Our village was
destroyed So I ask you now--

(locks eyes with Peter)
Are you the one the prophesy spoke
of

Peter hesitates Then-

PETER
No No I’m not

Kiowa raises his hands resting his case
Fuchs 10913 100

KIOWA
Then I will not fight with him And
any man who does is a fool

With that Kiowa exits and slowly one by one everyone in
the room éxits with him until it’s just Peter alone with
Tiger Lily and Ayain’a

The holy woman looks up at Peter with great sadness in her
eyes She says something to him and then exits

PETER
What did she say

TIGER LILY
She said you still do not believe
so they did not
(beat)
And that you and I are alone now

EXT KINGDOM MINE - MOMENTS LATER

TIGER LILY
Where are you going

PETER
Would my mother have given up

TIGER LILY
You’re not your mother

We can see on Peter’s face that comment land harder than
Tiger Lily meant it to He stops and faces her

PETER
Your last memory of my mother the
one you showed me —- my mother was
figh ing with the fairies wasn’t
she

TIGER LILY
Yes so

PETER

It was almost like she could speak
to them wasn’t it Well if she
could do thatimagine what I
could do

(then)
If we can get into the kingdom we
might have a chance I just need
someone to show me the way

Tiger Lily shakes her head
Fuchs 10913 101

TIGER LILY
I can get you to the entrance gate
but -- what if they won’t fight
with you If you can’t communicate
with them like she could

PETER
You mean what if I fail Well as
someone once told me then at least
I’ve tried
(then)
So what do you say

Tiger Lily hesitates -- then nods yes

Peter keeps looking at the wall

PETER
Did the map say anything about how
to get through this

TIGER LILY
Nothing I would have remembered
that

Peter frowns Then his brows raise

PETER
These markingswhat language is
this

TIGER LILY

This writing is in fairy Why

PETER
Because I don’t know how but -- I
can read it

TIGER LILY
What does it say

PETER

to the Hidden Kingdom shall
pass” Just that Over and over

TIGER LILY
Well you’re the prince Peter

TER
Yeah but i don t have--

Then he realizes -- reaches for his necklace

PETER (CONTD)
It couldn’t be

Peter takes off his necklace and approaches the wall And
slowly he inserts the graduated cylinders of the pan pipe
into the indentations on the wall and we hear-- A LOUD CLICK

Peter turns the PIPE as if opening a lock with a key and--

SUDDENLY THE WALL BEGINS TO DISASSEMBLE ANCIENT GEARS LONG
DORMANT SPINNING INTO ACTION

Thats why she give me this She
left me with the keys to the

RIVERS AND INTRICATE HIVE LIKE STRUCTURES AS FAR AS THE EYE
CAN SEE IT IS AN ORNATE AND VISUALLY STUNNING SIGHT THAT
FEELS EQUAL PARTS KRYPTONIAN AND INSECTILE THE LAST VESTIGES
OF A ONCE GREAT CIVLIZATION UNLIKE ANYTHING WE -- OR PETER --
HAVE EVER SEEN

BLACKBEARD
Take us deeper

As they descend into the subterranean kingdom we notice the
CRYSTALS seem to react to Peter as he passes
Fuchs 10913 104

ON PETER’S FACE-- as he takes this all in

Slowly from the HIVES we watch as-

SINGULAR POINTS OF BLINDINGLY LUMINOUS WHITE LIGHT EMERGE
Tiger Lily sees Peter watching them transfixed

TIGER LILY
They are your people

The fairies slowly float out will-o’-the-wisp-like as if
awakened by Peter’s very presence A stunning sight as more
and more and more fairies come out of hiding And before you
know it the Kingdom air is dense with these points of light
--a spectral downpour

BLACKBEARD
Remarkable

ON PETER’S FACE-- as he we hear UNINTELLIGIBLE VOICES
Frantic whispers

PETER
Do you hear that

TIGER LILY
Hear what

Only Peter can hear them As he’s processing this-

BLACKBEARD
Mr Turk send down the rest of the
air-Galléons You can fire when
ready We have a lot of ground to
cover

Turk nods turns to another crew-mate

TURK
Light ‘em up

PETER
What are you doing

BLACKBEARD
Getting what I came for

Peter watches in horror as the crew mans a series of NOZZLES
ON SWIVELS each attached to a CENTRAL PRESSURIZED CONTAINER
in the middle of the ship And within seconds--

VWOOSH Each nozzle SHOOTS OUT FLAMES over the crystalline
kingdom slowly setting the kingdom aflame

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)
Greek Fire Nothing burns hotter
We’1ll have all the dust we need in
no time
Fuchs 10913 105

PETER
No NO You can’t do that

TIGER LILY
Stop Please PLEASE

The pirates restrain Peter and Tiger Lily Blackbeard turns
to Peter moving slowly toward him while unsheathing his
sword

BLACKBEARD
Before I kill you I want you to
watch your kingdom burn Peter

He makes his way behind Peter Grabbing him by the hair he
presses his blade to Peter’s neck

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)
I want you to watch everythin our
mother ever cared about crumb
And know that this is all because
you failed

He PRESSES his hooked sword harder into Peter’s neck Peter

can only watch as the FLAMES build A place of unimaginable

beauty slowly cracking apart under the heat of the roaring
ires

The FAIRIES seem helpless trying to avoid the flames but
they have nowhere to go the air thick with black smoke

ON PETER’S FACE-- as those whispers GROW louder He GRIMACES

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)
(realizing)
Oh you can hear them can’t you
You can hear their screams

PETER
Please

ON TIGER LILY- as she struggles against Turk Helpless He’s
too strong

ON BLACKBEARD-- smiles as multiple air-Galleons join the
Revenge spewing flames over the Fairy Kingdom He lets go of
Peter

BLACKBEARD
What is it like Peter to know
that whatever you love is condemned
to die
(then)
I want you to kneel

Peter doesn’t do it

BLACKBEARD (CONT’D)
I said -- kneel
Fuchs 10913 106

PETER
(grits his teeth)
I am a prince like my father I am
a warrior like my mother I won’t
bow for roe or anyone else If you
want to kill me get on with it

The FLAMES are picking up now Blackbeard raises his sword

BLACKBEARD
As you wish

Brings the SWORD hurtling down--

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)
Die like your mother before you

When-- BOOM BOOM BOOM Everyone SPINS turning to see--

ONE OF THE AIR-GALLEONS TAKING A BARRAGE OF INCOMING
CANNONFIRE AND EXPLODING IN MID-AIR IN A MASSIVE FIREBALL

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)
What the hell just happened

As-- VWOOSH Another AIR-GALLEON EXPLODES THROUGH THE FLAMES
SHOOTING STRAIGHT AT THE REVENGE SENDING EVERYONE ON DECK
DUCKING FOR COVER

Peter and Tiger Lily run one way Blackbeard runs the other
ON THE SECOND AIR-GALLEON-- as it banks back toward the

Revenge swooping in close enough for Peter and Tiger Lily to
see

Peter and Tiger Lily are wide eyed as they see Hook helming
the refurbished air-Galleon

BAM He HITS into the Revenge’s starboard side keeping pace
with it

HOOK (CONT’D)
You two waiting for a better rescue
option or are you coming with me
Peter and Tiger Lily RUN FULL STEAM across the deck

Peter’s closer makes it first Tiger Lily’s right behind
him but-

BLACKBEARD
Dive

Turk takes Blackbeard’s order and NOSEDIVES the Revenge at
the last second before Tiger Lily can make the jump

ON PETER-- as he hits the deck of Hook’s ship
Fuchs 10913 107

This ain’t nap time kid Man a

gun

Peter RACES to one of the long guns

PETER
We need to blow a

hole in the

ceiling The fairies are going to

burn up down here
them a way out

HOOK

How do you know that

PETER
They told me

Hook nods Then does a genui

ne double take

PETER (CONT’D)

Don’t ask

ON THE REVENGE-- Blackbeard

barks orders at Turk

BLACKBEARD
I want that ship blown out of the
sky Do you hear me

He turns to see Tiger Lily h
and immediately engages

olding off four different pirates

BLACKBEARD (CONT’D)

Mind if I cut in

VWOOSH He SWIPES at her dr
Blackbeard withdraws his sec
competitor

AND NOW WE HAVE AN EPIC SIMUI
THE AGES AS TIGER LILY AND BI

awing blood Tiger Lily smiles as

Hook SPINS the wheel hard t

HOOK

ilting the ship at an angle
Fuchs 10913 108

BANG Peter unleashes a wave of cannon-fire at the roof of
the cavern

EXT KINGDOM MINE - CONTINUOUS

The miners -- including the natives -- are going about their
business when-

The entire ground beneath them begins to rumble BANG
Another rumble Everyone RACES to clear the floor of the mine
as--

PIECE BY PIECE THE MINE FLOOR COLLAPSES FROM THE CENTER OUT
REVEALING THE FAIRY KINGDOM AND THE BATTLE BELOW

The miners gather around the edge of the gaping earthen hole
and begin to watch transfixed by what they’re seeing

INT FAIRY KINGDOM - CONTINUOUS

ON HOOK’S AIR-GALLEON-- we see the hole in the cavern ceiling
open up and the fairies begin to filter out

HOOK
There we go Was that so hard

Peter ruefully shakes his head As the escape from the
pirates continues-

PETER
So what happened You came back I
thought you didn’t care

HOOK
I lied

Peter smiles as- BAM The Revenge has caught up to them and-
BAM Hits into their port-side again

Tiger Lily still battling Blackbeard sees the ships
proximity and backs her way out of the fight onto Hook’s
ship

Now the ships are racing neck-and-neck Tiger Lily on Hook’s
ship Blackbeard on the Revenge Blackbeard however is
fighting with two swords He’s beyond good with a blade he’s
virtuosic

ON TIGER LILY-- as- WHAM Blackbeard knocks her blade out of
her hand He’s about to land the killer blow when--

PETER
NO

Peter LEAPS to Tiger Lily’s defense as-- BAM The Revenge
SLAMS into Hook’s Galleon sending Peter and Tiger to the
deck of the Revenge and leaving Hook all alone Exposed
Fuchs 10913 109

ON TIGER LILY- as the pirates restrain her Peter SCAMPERS
for cover He’s surrounded backed up against the port-side
of the ship as Blackbeard and the pirates close in

ON HOOK’S FACE-- as he turns back to see Peter’s gone and
that he’s now a sitting duck

ON BLACKBEARD-- sees the same thing

BLACKBEARD
What are you waiting for Fire
FIRE FIRE
And SUDDENLY -- everything seems to slow down
PETER
No Hook

BAM BAM BAM A HAIL OF CANNON-FIRE HITS HOOK’S SHIP HE
RUNS AS IT HITS THE DECK WOOD SHRAPNEL FLYING ALL AROUND
HIM BUT THERE’S NOWHERE TO GO

PETER (CONT’D)
NO

For a moment- Hook’s eyes lock with Peter’s A final farewell
and they both know it

BLACKBEARD
Again Fire again

And with the Fairy Kingdom burning below-- BOOM Hook’s ship
is finally BLOWN out of the skies

ON PETER’S TORTURED FACE-- as he watches Hook free fall

ON HOOK-- he closes his eyes as he tumbles downward
accepting his fate

ON KIOWA-- who stands with his tribe looking down on the
scene

ON TIGER LILY-- restrained but she locks tearful eyes with
Peter

TIGER LILY
You have to believe Peter You
have to believe
And as Blackbeard closes in Peter takes a deep breath
AND LEAPS BACKWARD OFF THE LIP OF THE AIR-GALLEON

AND DOWN HE GOES PRESSING HIS ARMS TO HIS SIDES FORCING
HIMSELF TO DROP FASTER AND FASTER

ON BLACKBEARD-- mystified

BLACKBEARD
What is he doing
Fuchs 10913 110

ON TIGER LILY-- silently praying

TIGER LILY
You must believe Peter You have
to believe

AND BACK ON PETER-- as catches up to Hook and GRABS him
wrapping him in a bear hug

THE TWO OF THEM FALL TOGETHER LIKE TANDEM SKY DIVERS EXCEPT
THESE TWO DON’T HAVE A CHUTE

PETER
Tell me you believe in the
prophesy Hook Tell me you
elieve I need to hear it

Hook wounded bloodied shakes his head as they near the
ground

HOOK
I don’t

PETER
Damn it Hook

Peter’s face falls Hook strains to speak--

HOOK
I believe in you

Peter STRAINS WILLING it to happen Willing himself to fly
andhe JUST can’t do it

PULL WIDE the two of them look so small from this angle
Their fall almost graceful enough to make us forget the
terror they must be feeling We watch them for a second more
before they both disappear into the FLAMES below

ON TIGER LILY- devastated

Blackbeard smiles turns back to Tiger Lily

BLACKBEARD
Where were we

When- a MINER shouts something from above and everyone turns
just in time to see-

VWOOSH PETER STILL HOLDING HOOK EXPLODING THROUGH THE
FLAMES RISING LIKE A PHOENIX OUT OF THE ASHES BELOW --

FLYING

NOT FLOATING NOT SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR FLYING LITERALLY LIKE
SUPERMAN WITH SUCH FORCE SUCH MAJESTY THAT EVERYONE CAN
ONLY WATCH IN AWE

And as he shoots skyward we hear a lone voice cry--
Fuchs 10913 111
KIOWA (0S)
Pan
ON KIOWA-- pointing

KIOWA (CONT’D)
Pan PAN PAN

And what was one voice becomes ten Becomes a hundred
Becomes a thousand Until everyone in the mine is chanting
their voices booming into the Kingdom below echoing-

EVERYONE
PAN PAN PAN

The GUARD PIRATES surrounding the miners and Natives look
unsure what to do Nothing like this has ever happened
before

ON TIGER LILY-- tears streaming down her cheeks

ON AYAIN’A-- in the cheering crowd as she smiles

AND FINALLY ON PETER-- Hook looks at him

HOOK
This is great Don’t drop me

Peter smiles and SWOOPS down depositing the injured Hook
with Ayain’a

ON PETER-- as he SOARS back into the air flying over the
Natives still chanting

ON KIOWA-- who picks up his axe
KIOWA
What are you waiting for Stand
and fight Stand and fight

He TAKES the axe and SWINGS it at the NEAREST PIRATE taking
him totally by surprise

KIOWA (CONTD)
Stand And fight

And with that- THE REBELLION IS ON Villagers fighting tooth
and nail with only their axes but with the element of
surprisesoon joined by miners who see their opportunity
for freedom And as the rebellion INTENSIFIES--

VWOOSH Peter ZOOMS back down into the Fairy Kingdom

ON THE REVENGE-- Blackbeard GRABS Tiger Lily His trump card

BLACKBEARD
You’re not going anywhere

ON PETER-- as he FLIES through the air dodging cannonball
BLASTS and repeats to himself--
Fuchs 10913 112

PETER
One with the beastone with the
beast

And SLOWLY -- we watch as the WHITE LIGHTS OF THE FAIRIES
coalesce around him as they did his mother The WHISPERS in
his head grow louder except this time -- Peter doesn’t seem
disturbed This time he’s really listening And so are they

He WAVES his hand forward and like a WAVE OF SOLID LIGHT the
fairies SMASH into the Revenge BOOM He surprises another
air-Galleon distracting the captain enough to CRASH THE AIR-
SHIP INTO ANOTHER AIR-GALLEON CROSSING its path

Peter and the fairies are single-handedly wiping out the
pirates below while the miner rebellion rages up above them

ON BLACKBEARD-— as pirates abandon him left and right
literally jumping ship against the onslaught he holds Tiger
Lily at knife point When--

PETER (CONT’D)
Captain

Peter lands on the deck Blackbeard smiles

BLACKBEARD
Have you come to watch another
friend die Peter

He HOLDS the sword to Tiger Lily’s throat Peter walks toward
him

BLACKBEARD (CONTD)
You take one step closer and the
princess dies

PETER
Can I ask you one question
(th en)
Who’ § sailing the ship

Blackbeard turns to see-- the answer is no one and that the
ship is heading toward a crystal cliff Tiger Lily takes
advantage of his surprise and -- BAM -- hits him in the
solar plexus racing toward Peter

Blackbeard turns back as Peter levitates off the deck of the
ship holding Tiger Lily a split second before the Revenge
makes contact with the cliff and we see in his eyes something
we haven’t seen before -- fear -- as he realizes there is no
way off this thing

PETER (CONT’D)
Hey

On Blackbeard’s frightened face-

PETER (CONTD)
Think of a happy thought
Fuchs 10913 113

VWOOSH Peter FLIES off the ship as- BWOOSH The Revenge
collides with the crystal cliff igniting the pressurized
Greek Fire in an epic fiery explosion the debris RAINING
DOWN down into a subterranean river below

ON ANOTHER AIR-SHIP-- as Turk and Smee watch the Revenge go
down

TURK
Let’s get out of here Now
HELMSMAN
Sir--
TURK

This battle’s over We live to
fight another day Take us up

And with that-- Turk and his crew fly the hell out of there

ON THE FLOOR OF THE KINGDOM-- Peter sets Tiger Lily down as
the fairies swirl around him in celebration

Tiger Lily smiles at Peter and they embrace As they part-
TIGER LILY
(sees something behind
him)
Peter

Peter turns to see the WHITE LIGHTS COMING TOGETHER ONE BY
ONE BY ONE to form an image Peter steps toward it

WOMANS VOICE
(whisper )
Peter

Only he can hear it as more fairies join together the image
clarifying

WOMANS VOICE (CONT’D)
Peter

ON PETER’S FACE-- as tears come to his eyes

PETER
Mum

Reverse to see

MARY’S FACE TWINKLING THERE IN THE SKY BEFORE HIS VERY EYES
COMPOSED OF A THOUSAND TINY FAIRIES EACH VIBRATING IN PLACE
A LIVING SPECTRAL PORTRAIT OF MARY MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER

She smiles at her son Her voice echoes in his head

MARY
You found me

Peter can barely keep it together then notices--
Fuchs 10913 114
PETER
I have your eyes

MARY
You have my heart

Mary smiles Peter is overwhelmed shakes his head

PETER
I’ve imagined this moment my whole
life and now -- now I don’t even

know what to say I love you mum
So much I don’t know how you can
miss someone you’ve never met so
much -- every day

MARY
I can’t stay long my son

PETER
No mum don’t go I did all this
for you Without you I’m lost
again What do I do now

MARY
You are not lost You are home --
on this island with these people
Your people Your famil And you
must never give up on t em as you
never gave up on me

The image begins to distort

PETER
Mum I just don’t want to lose you
again

MARY

You will never lose me I will
always be a part of this place --
and a part of you I love you my
son My Peter

My Peter-Pan

And with that the image is gone the fairies flying off ina
million different directions

ANGLE ON PETERS TEAR-STREAKED FACE-- as for the first time
he finally lets go of the painand smiles

EXT KINGDOM MINE - DAY

Peter walks through the mine to a hero’s greeting

ON TIGER LILY-- as she finds Kiowa in the crowd They
embrace

TIGER LILY
I thought we’d lost you
Fuchs 10913 115

KIOWA
You almost did
(then re Peter)
You were right though As usual

TIGER LILY
(smiles)
Can I ask you something

ON HOOK-- watching Tiger Lily speaking with Kiowa in the
distance and then-- his face falls as the two EMBRACE

PETER
(approaches )
You going to be okay

He HOLDS up his arm to reveal-- his right hand is GONE

PETER (CONT’D)
Good Lord How did that happen

Hook POKES his hand through his shirt-sleeve

HOOK
Nah I should be fine Thanks to

Peter smiles and is about to move on when-

HOOK (CONTD)

PETER

Hook smiles Peter moves on as Tiger Lily walks up

HOOK (CONTD)

TIGER LILY
Yes We thank you We were also

ON PETER-- thronged by miners Tiger Lily fights her way to
get to him and pulls him away

TIGER LILY (CONTD)

Blackbeard may be dead but Turk

untouched There are still so many
camps to liberate and-
