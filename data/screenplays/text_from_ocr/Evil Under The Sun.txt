INT OFFICE OF THE TROJAN INSURANCE COMPANY DAY

A SENIOR EXECUTIVE of the Trojan Insurance Company sits at his
desk reading some papers There is a knock at the door and he
looks up eagerly as a young female SECRETARY comes in

SECRETARY
Hercules Parrot sir

The SECRETARY withdraws as HERCULE POIROT enters He carries
a folder of papers The EXECUTIVE rises and indicates a chair
on the other side of the desk

EXECUTIVE
Good morning Monsieur Poirot Please
take a seat
8 Continued

POIROT
Bon Jour Monsieur

He sits in the proffered seat as the EXECUTIVE regains his

own chair
EXECUTIVE
Well I hope you have some good news
for me
POIROT

Alas no I regret that I can find
nothing in these reports to justify

my re-investigating this case for you
It is all perfectly clear from the
police reports I know Mrs Alice
Corrigan insured her life with your
company in her husbands favour and
that he was the only person with a
motive for killing her but when it
comes down to the copper tacks he could
not possibly have done so Clearly on
the evidence the lady was murdered
between four oclock and four fifteen
when the body was found at Marley Copse
From two oclock to four twenty Mr
Edward Corrigan was seen by at least half
a dozen people to be on a train coming
up from London And the railway station
was a good fifteen minutes walk from
Marley Copse Non it is parbleu one
of those rare cases where the Insurance
Company must as you say laugh and
lump it

EXECUTIVE
Well if thats your view Monsieur Poirot
then I suppose well have to er - do
just that I must say Im not surprised
The evidence is most conclusive Still
we had hoped

POIROT
For a miracle Alas it is not possible
As is most often the case in les affaires
criminelles the facts are exactly as
they appear to be I wish you good day
Monsieur

POIROT rises bows and departs leaving the folder of papers
on the table

EXT AERIAL VIEW OF SMUGGLERS ISLAND LATE AFTERNOON

An establishing SHOT of Smugglers Island basking in the late
afternoonss sun A rowing boat is approaching the Island
with four figures in it WE TRACK IN towards the nautical
windows of the bar of the Jolly Roger Hotel

INT THE BAR OF THE JOLLY ROGER HOTEL LATE AFTERNOON

DAPHNE CASTLE a flamboyant fortyish ex-courtesan now
proprietress of the Jolly Roger Hotel stands in the bar
straightening her hair and generally putting the finishing
touches to her appearance It is about five oclock on a
summers evening She looks out of the bottle glass windows
down at the strip of water which separates the Island from
the Mainland

INTEXT THE SEA LATE AFTERNOON

A SHOT of the rowing boat approaches the Island seen
through the bottle glass windows from DAPHNE CASTLEs point
of view

INT THE BAR OF THE JOLLY ROGER HOTEL LATE AFTERNOON
DAPHNE CASTLE reacts with satisfaction

EXT ROWING BOAT LATE AFTERNOON

BILL the Boatman is rowing three guests across from the Main-
land He is a typical Salt In the boat are MR and MRS
ODELL GARDENER an American couple from New York She is
large with blue rinsed hair and diamante spectacles worn on
a chain He is thin tall slightly stooped and legalistic
with a scrawny neck topped by a turtle shaped head The

last occupant of the boat is MISS AGNES BREWSTER an
athletic middleaged spinster who cloaks her vulnerability
under a gruff manner

MRS GARDENER
(looking towards the Island)
Ah Smugglers Island My doesnt
it look romantic I can just see
Warner Baxter and Elissa Landi in
a movie set here cant you Odell

MR GARDENER
Yes dear
13 Continued

MRS GARDENER
It would have to be something like the
kidnapping of a Sheiks daughter by a
brigand of the sea Oriental Pride
yields to Piratical kisses in a duel
of male might and female charm An
exotic drama of loves sublime cruelty

She sighs rapturously

MR GARDENER
I believe they have already used those
particular phrases to describe the motion
picture In Her Arms dear though I
believe on that occasion they were
Parisian kisses to which Oriental Pride
yielded

MRS GARDENER

(firmly)
Well never mind about that Odell In
the Jolly Roger Hotel it would darn well
yield to a Pirates busses

(to Miss Brewster)
Were Myra and Odell Gardener by the
way From New York City

MR and MRS GARDENER extend their hands MISS BREWSTER shakes
then

MISS BREWSTER
How do you do Im Agnes Brewster
I hope you are enjoying your holiday

MR GARDENER
Its‘been just great Weve been doing

England MISS BREWSTER
And have you done it

MRS GARDENER
Sure Canterbury Cathedral The Crown
Jewels Lords Croquet Ground though
those gentlemen werent playing the
day we were there - you know the whole
box of tricks But enough is enough
Last week I said to Mr Kelso at
Cooks sight seeing is all very well
put all I want now is to get to some
quiet spot in the Mediterranean and
just relax Mind you I said not just
anywhere Oh no It had to be sanitary
A cousin of Odells went to a place in
Wales last year where they only had an
earth closet Isnt it so Odell
13 Continued

MR GARDENER
Two earth closets I think it was dear
One for the guests and one for the
servants Mind you I believe it was
very picturesque

MRS GARDENER

(sharply)
Picturesque or not youd think at
least theyd have been able to provide
the paying customers with a water closet

(to Miss Brewster)
You British sometimes take this Olde
Worlde charm to quite ludicrous lengths

MISS BREWSTER
Its just that we dont believe in
pampering ourselves thats all Its
my belief that all that central heating
you have in America saps the energy of
the nation aside from being extremely
bad for the complexion It encourages
‘acne in the young and craters in the
not so young
(to Bill the Boatman)
Come along Boatman dig those oars in
Pull with a will

BILL gives her a sour look and rows even more lethargically
than he has been doing

MIX THROUGH TO the next scene

14 EXT THE TERRACE OF THE JOLLY ROGER HOTEL LATE AFTERNOON

DAPHNE CASTLE stands on the terrace of the Jolly Roger Hotel
welcoming MR and MRS GARDENER and MISS BREWSTER In the
background two servants BERT and CHARLIE struggle up the
steps from the tiny harbour to the hotel carrying baggage

DAPHNE CASTLE
I am Daphne Castle let me welcome
you to Smugglers Island I do hope
youll be most comfortable here

MISS BREWSTER
I think Mr and Mrs Gardener are a little
concerned about earth closets

DAPHNE CASTLE
Earth closets What can you possibly
mean Miss Brewster

Continued

MR GARDENER
Perhaps I should explain that my
wife is somewhat suspicious of
lavatorial systems which are not
indigenous to the United States
of America Mrs Castle

DAPHNE CASTLE
(to Mrs Gardener)
Im sure you will find ali the loos
here perfectly adequate Mrs Gardener
We even have bidets in all the bath-
rooms If you will please follow me

DAPHNE CASTLE moves off towards the hotel followed by
MISS BREWSTER

MRS GARDENER
I tend to believe that bidets are
basically un-American Odell Still
I suppose well have to put up with
them

The GARDENERS follow the others towards the Hotel

EXT ROWING BOAT LATE AFTERNOON

BILL rows his boat towards Smugglers Island It contains
MR BLATT a jolly coarse life-and-soul-of-the-party self-
made man and PATRICK REDFERN and his wife CHRISTINE REDFERN
He is a good looking young Irishman fair-haired and
athletic She is fair skinned pleasant looking in a
somewhat washed-out way They are sitting in a reserved
silence MR BLATT inevitably decides to start the ball
rolling

MR BLATT
Well well well Might as well
break the ice Blatts the name
Horace Blatt Beef or mutton L
for leather Aphorism Tea for two
twice Got it

He laughs considerably at his own oft repeated witticism
PATRICK REDFERN
Im Patrick Redfern and this is my
wife Christine

They smile at each other
15 Continued

MR BLATT
A Mick

PATRICK REDFERN
Well I come from Dublin actually
but I havent been back for years

MR BLATT
I say I say I say How do you
make an Irishman burn his ear

PATRICK REDFERN
Ring him up when hes ironing It
wasnt very funny when I first heard
it five years ago

MR BLATT crushed looks away towards the Island

16 INT HOTEL CORRIDOR AND VIEW OF BEDROOMS EVENING

The two servants BERT and CHARLIE are putting the luggage in
the allocated bedrooms WE TRACK DOWN a long corridor
following DAPHNE CASTLE to see through open doors that MR
AND MRS GARDENER MISS BREWSTER and MR HORACE

BLATT have already established themselves in their rooms
Unpacking has started and we hear the sound of baths

being run She approaches the REDFERNS room

17 INT MR AND MRS REDFERNS BEDROOM EVENING

MR and MRS REDFERN are starting to unpack CHARLIE is
just retiring through the open door as DAPHNE CASTLE appears
in it

DAPHNE CASTLE
Mr and Mrs Redfern

PATRICK REDFERN
Yes

DAPHNE CASTLE
Im Daphne Castle - the Pirate Chief
Welcome to Smugglers Island

CHRISTINE REDFERN
Thank you It all looks marvellous
Im sure well have a nice time here
17 Continued

DAPHNE CASTLE
Well a bit naughty I hope too

CHRISTINE REDFERN
Naughty

DAPHNE CASTLE
Well what are hols for if one cant
do a bit of flirting and get a bit
pissyboos

PATRICK REDFERN
Quite right -

CHRISTINE shoots her husband a venomous look

DAPHNE CASTLE
Yes when fate cast me up here on
this old rock I said to myself people
are going to have fun in a crazy old
English atmosphere even though its
in the Med So youll find the
servants are all English and properly
trained and theres lots of games
to play and of course there‘s great
grub

PATRICK REDFERN
Ah now were talking Most English
hotels fall down in that department
Cold mutton and cabinet pudding are
not my idea of holiday nourishment

DAPHNE CASTLE
I dont think youll find that either
dish features on darling Andreas
menus Lets face it he is almost the
greatest saucier in the Aegean I say
almost because he does have a slightly
hysterical hand with the créme fraiche
But it is a fault on the right side
See you for cocktails around seven

She breezes out

PATRICK REDFERN
Funny lady

He takes a robe and swimming trunks from his suitcase and
goes into the bathroom

17 Continued
PATRICK REDFERN (V0O)
What do you think she meant by fate
casting her up on this old rock

CHRISTINE REDFERN
Dont you know the story She used to
be the mistress of King Zog of Albania
and when he married he gave her this
island

PATRICK REDFERN (VO)
Provided she kept away I suppose
Generous fellow

CHRISTINE REDFERN
Wise fellow Wives dont much like
girl friends hanging around the place -
or didnt you know that either

PATRICK REDFERN walks into the room wearing only a swimming
costume and carrying his robe We note his fine physique
There is a moment of tension between them

PATRICK REDFERN
Yes I had noticed Toodle doo

He leaves the room jauntily CHRISTINE looks after him
speculatively then moves to the window to look out Her
face hardens at what she sees

18 EXT THE SMALL HARBOUR EVENING

We see the harbour from CHRISTINE REDFERNs point of view
The rowing boat is just being made fast by BILL In it are
CAPTAIN KENNETH MARSHALL a well groomed slightly stern

man of about forty five years old his wife ARLENA MARSHALL
a tall stunning red head of about thirty years old and

his daughter (her step daughter) LINDA MARSHALL gauche
unformed unhappy girl of fifteen or so

19 EXT THE JETTY IN THE HARBOUR EVENING

The MARSHALLS step ashore At the same moment PATRICK REDFERN
passes them on a path which leads down to the Hotel Beach

He stops when he catches sight of ARLENA his face registering
surprised delight Then his gaze travels uneasily to her
husband and back again to ARLENA

PATRICK REDFERN
Why huilo Arlena

19 Continued

ARLENA MARSHALL
Dahling Fancy meeting you here of
all places What an astounding coin-
cidence

PATRICK REDFERN
By St Patrick himself and all the
snakes in Ireland it is that

ARLENA MARSHALL
Do you know my husband Kenneth

PATRICK REDFERN
Hullo there

KENNETH MARSHALL
How do you do

ARLENA MARSHALL
Patrick and I met in London at the
Gordons a couple of weeks ago You
remember I told you about it Ken
They had that marvellous Josephine
Baker singing there

She sings Les Mots DAmour directing it in a very obvious
way at PATRICK REDFERN Quite abruptly she stops singing and

suddenly

There is

turns on LINDA

ARLENA MARSHALL
This is my step-daughter Linda
(loud aside to Linda)
Stop standing there all pink and sticky
like a half eaten marshmallow and
say good evening to Mr Redfern

LINDA MARSHALL
(mumbling)
Good evening

PATRICK REDFERN
Good evening Linda

an awkward moment of tension
PATRICK REDFERN

Well Ill be taking myself off to have
my dip See you all later

ARLENA MARSHALL looks after him appreciatively as he walks

off down

towards the beach Her husband and step daughter

regard her with somewhat less than the same pleasure The

CAMERA PANS round and tracks in towards CHRISTINE REDFERNs
window to see her still standing at it looking down

MIX THROUGH TO the next scene

EXT ROWING BOAT EVENING

BILL rows his boat raggedly towards the Island In the
stern sits HERCULE POIROT in acute distress

POIROT
Ma foie Cannot you row this boat
more calmly

BILL
Gawd bless you sir Its calmer
than a cup of tea today

POIROT
I have never found anything calming
about a cup of tea It is simply a
device used by the English to underscore
tension

BILL
Well you ought to see it somedays -
waves like roller coasters

POIROT groans and clasps his stomach

INT SUN LOUNGE EVENING

In the glassed in sun lounge DAPHNE CASTLEs cocktail party
is in full swing MR and MRS GARDENER are talking to MR

and MRS REDFERN and MISS BREWSTER CAPTAIN MARSHALL and his
daughter are talking to each other DAPHNE CASTLE and

a COUPLE OF MAIDS - GLADYS NORRACOTT and BETTY TRUMBLE -
are moving anxiously through the room serving canapes

and drinks In the general chatter of conversation we pass
close by HORACE BLATT telling POIROT a dirty joke

MR BLATT
You see this feller comes running
down the hospital corridor holding
his privates pursued by the nurse
carrying a bowl of poiling water
And following them is the doctor
yelling No nurse What I said was
prick his boil

Continued

MR BLATT collapses into gales of laughter and moves away
The CAMERA TRACKS into a CLOSE UP of a baffled POIROT

as he is joined by DAPHNE CASTLE and BETTY TRUMBLE holding
a tray of drinks

DAPHNE CASTLE
How about a cocktail Monsieur Poirot

POIROT
What would you suggest Madame

DAPHNE CASTLE points to the various glasses on the tray as
she names them

DAPHNE CASTLE
A White Lady A Sidecar A Mainbrace
A Between The Sheets A King Zog

POIROT examines the last named in its tall frosted glass
dubiously

POIROT
And what might be in that one Madame

‘DAPHNE CASTLE
Mostly 151 Bacardi -Arejo Rum
Itll grow hair on your eyeballs

POIROT
I do not believe that my eyes need
to be that guarded Madame but if you
have a little Creme de Cassis or
perhaps a Sirop de Fraises I should
be most content

DAPHNE CASTLE
(doubtfully)
Sounds a bit soppy to me but Ill
see what I can do

POIROT
Merci Madame

BETTY TRUMBLE leaves with her tray of drinks to circulate
through the party She is replaced at a sign from DAPHNE
CASTLE by GLADYS NORRACOTT bearing a tray of Canapés
Prominent are some multicoloured ones and others formed
into the shape of smiling black faces

DAPHNE CASTLE
Meanwhile how about a Rainbows End
or a nice Birmingham Smile Theyre
both tres Muresque - you know very
moreish
a1

Continued

The dish of canapes is proffered and POIROT takes one

DAPHNE CASTLEs attention is distracted by MR and MRS REDFERN
who are in animated conversation with the GARDENERS and with
a bright backwards looking smile at POIROT she swoops down

on them

DAPHNE CASTLE
Ah Mr Redfern what did I tell you
Everybody enjoys themselves here
Its not called the Jolly Roger for
nothing - even though the name might
be said to be more appropriate to an
amusing brothel

Behind her POIROT bites into his canape Creamed Crab
spurts out over the lapel of his jacket The CAMERA MOVES
with DAPHNE CASTLE as she joins KENNETH and LINDA MARSHALL
In the background POIROT dabs ruefully at his clothing with
a handkerchief and unashamedly listens

KENNETH MARSHALL
By Jove Daphne youve been successful
since we last met - how long ago is it

DAPHNE CASTLE
It must be a good seventeen years
Linda certainly wasnt born As a
matter of fact I dont think youd
even married your first wife then

KENNETH MARSHALL
No I dont think I had Poor Mary
she had such an unhappy life But
lets not talk about her Lets talk
about you Youre rich and famous -
everyone’s heard about this crazy hotel
of yours - its always in the glossies

DAPHNE CASTLE
Poor and infamous you mean

They laugh intimately together

Seriously you shouldnt believe every-
thing you hear Kenneth Im not that
much changed from the daft Daphne you
used to know at Shipley

LINDA MARSHALL
Were you at Shipley Daddys told me
so much about it

Continued

DAPHNE CASTLE
Yes we were neighbours for years
Do you remember the day we took Toby
down to the river to get water rats
and you pushed me in in my best dress

KENNETH MARSHALL
Absolutely And you flew into the most
frightful rage and half choked me to
death

DAPHNE CASTLE
Not me Its impossible The only
attack I’ve ever made on anyone was
when I threw my spaghetti alla yongole
at Mussolini for trying to grope
me under the table in the Vatican

KENNETH MARSHALL
What rot You used to fly into the
most fearful rages in those days
We all had to watch our ps and qs
a bit Ah here comes Arlena now

ARLENA MARSHALL enters the room She is dramatically

attired and gorgeous to look at Conversation ceases on the
instant as all eyes turn towards her PATRICK REDFERN

takes a few steps in her direction his arms outstretched
and we freeze the picture A series of quick cuts

establish the companys reactions

SLOW MIX THROUGH to the next scene

EXT THE TERRACE ABOVE THE BATHING BEACH MORNING

HERCULE POIROT arrayed in a white duck suit lies in a deck
chair surveying the sunlit scene below Sunbathing on the
beach are MR and MRS REDFERN (the latter in the shade of an
umbrella) HORACE BLATT KENNETH MARSHALL and LINDA MARSHALL
and MR and MRS GARDENER DAPHNE CASTLE is swimming

MISS BREWSTER sits beside POIROT on the terrace

MISS BREWSTER
I understand you are a very distinguished
detective Monsieur Poirot

POIROT
People have been felicitous enough
to have told me that I have some slight
skill in that metier Madame

22 Continued

MISS BREWSTER
I do hope we re not going to have any
bodies on Smugglers Island

POIROT
Let me assure you Madame I am here
simply to spend the holiday I do
not even think of crime And yet as
to bodies what are they

He points down to the beach pelow

Regard them there lying out in rows
like corpses in the morgue They are
not men and women There is nothing
personal about them They are just
bodies like butchers meat on slabs
Chunks of flesh grilling in the sun
When I was young one barely saw even
the ankle

MISS BREWSTER

(firmly)
I must say though that I think the
things we wear nowadays are much more
sensible The air must be allowed to
circulate freely round the body
A healthy mind in a healthy body
thats my motto and I keep mine healthy
rowing

POIROT looks down self-consciously at his expansive paunch
MISS BREWSTER notices

MISS BREWSTER
Youd soon have that off if you rowed
Monsieur Poirot

POIROT
Mademoiselle I detest boats I have
the mal de mer Even my bath gives me
sea sickness

On the beach we see CHRISTINE REDFERN get up from under her
umbrellaand start to walk up the steps towards the hotel
PATRICK REDFERN goes down the beach to swim The CAMERA
ZOOMS in for a moment to isolate him as he plunges in and
starts to swim using a powerful crawl stroke

22 Continued

MISS BREWSTER

(half Voice Over Patrick

Redfern swimming and half

direct speech)
How unfortunate I suppose its a bit
like heights Some people cant stand
them Im not very good myself but
Mrs Redfern is far worse Why only
this morning on the cliff path above
Keelhaul Caves she turned giddy
and simply clung to me quite unable to
move

CHRISTINE REDFERN comes up to the group Her skin noticeably
very white

Hullo dear We were just talking
about you

CHRISTINE REDFERN
Its a wonder my ears werent burning
Everywhere else does so easily

POIROT
You dont like the sunbathing Madame

CHRISTINE REDFERN
I only wish I could but I dont go
brown I just become like a cassata -
pink skin white blisters and green
in the face

Polite laughter while she puts on her robe

Isnt it blissful here So tranquil
So far away from all trouble and
violence

POIROT
It is true the sky is blue and the
sun shines but you forget Madame
everywhere there is evil under the sun

ARLENA MARSHALL walks down from the hotel to the beach
passing the group She is very suntanned and wears a back-
less white bathing suit On her head she wears a fantastic
Chinese hat of jade green cardboard She moves with superb
assurance and the whole effect is rather like a stage entrance

POIROT
Ab Madame Marshall What was her
stage name

22 Continued

MISS BREWSTER
(sharply)
Arlena Stuart

POIROT
Oh yes I saw her in Come and Go
a couple of years ago at the Alhambra
It was trés charmant Did you ever
see her Mademoiselle

MISS BREWSTER
I was employed by her once and she
is not charmant Monsieur Poirot
believe me Shes poisonously
rotten through and through

POIROT
Is it possible Mademoiselle

MISS BREWSTER
Yes I was her secretary for over
five years I tell you she can be a
remorseless fiend She wants every-
thing for herself Shell give
nothing to anybody else no references
no help And shell use any device
to prevent you telling the truth about
her

23 EXT BOOTY BEACH MORNING
ARLENA MARSHALL has reached the beach and stands irresolutely
looking about her PATRICK REDFERN swims back to the beach
with powerful flamboyant strokes as if drawn towards her
by a magnet

24 EXT THE TERRACE ABOVE THE BATHING BEACH MORNING

The group of POIROT MISS BREWSTER and CHRISTINE REDFERN
is as it was before in Scene 22

POIROT
What you say is truly shocking
Mademoiselle Dont you think so
Madame Redfern

CHRISTINE REDFERN gets to her feet and waves to her husband
In the distance we see him pause then ignore the wave and
deliberately walk off with ARLENA MARSHALL down the beach
Abruptly CHRISTINE REDFERN turns and leaves the terrace
heading back towards the hotel

Continued

MISS BREWSTER
I think I shall go for my row now

MISS BREWSTER rises and walks off the terrace in the direction

of the small harbour
Slowly POIROT shakes his head

POIROT
Mais oui Undoubtedly there is the
smell of evil here

POIROT struggles out of the deck chair and strolls down the
steps towards the beach

EXT BOOTY BEACH MORNING

DAPHNE CASTLE comes out of the sea Her bathing suit is
outstandingly chic Her gaze is alternating between
KENNETH MARSHALL who is lying next to his daughter on the
sand taking the sun and ARLENA MARSHALL and PATRICK REDFERN
who are sitting and talking further down the beach as
POIROT strolls up to her

POIROT
Good morning Mademoiselle What a
charming costume

DAPHNE CASTLE
Why thank you Monsieur Poirot

POIROT
The bathing costume can be so un-
flattering nest ce pas

DAPHNE CASTLE
(looking at Arlena)
It is my opinion that ninety eight
percent of all the people in this
world should never put one on

POIROT
Mrs Marshall of course being one of
the remaining two percent

DAPHNE CASTLE
Obviously Its one of a couple of
activities she does to perfection

POIROT
The other being

DAPHNE CASTLE
Adultery

25 Continued

POIROT
So you think your old friend of
seventeen years ago has made the
mistake in marrying her eh

She shoots him a shrewd look

DAPHNE CASTLE
A mistake Its a silver plated
copper bottomed gilt-edged disaster
Still it probably suits him He
always was a collector of lame ducks

POIROT
She doesnt look much like le canard
poiteux to me

DAPHNE CASTLE
Oh you dont understand He married
his first wife simply because no one
else would have her and when she
died he upped and married that shop-
worn piece of fluff when she was
jilted by Lord Coddington after being
cited in his divorce

POIROT
Well perhaps Mademoiselle she makes
him the good wife

DAPHNE CASTLE
Good wives as they say in Italy
do not grow horns on their husbands
heads Why only last year that
randy old fool Sir George Barry left
her every penny of his money -
about one hundred thousand pounds by
all account - enough to keep her
in single chins for life and I tell
you she didnt get that for her racing
tips Now it looks as if shes got her
claws into Patrick Redfern and that
poor wife of his hasnt the faintest
idea of how to remove them Its a
pity really but in the end I suppose
all ladies have to learn to defend
what they want Dont you agree
Monsieur Poirot

She smiles at POIROT mischievously and walks off along the
beach to join KENNETH MARSHALL POIROT looks after her
thoughtfully He sees LINDA MARSHALL get up and run down
the beach towards where PATRICK REDFERN and ARLENA MARSHALL

Continued

are talking Slowly he walks in the same direction MR
BLATT comes splashing up from the sea in a loud striped
bathing suit which makes him look like a corpulent wasp
and intercepts POIROT

MR BLATT
Good morning Monsieur P I see
they wont get you in the briny in

a hurry

POIROT
Non I have never cared for la
mer

MR BLATT

Well I suppose you cant teach an
old frog new tricks eh

MR BLATT laughs uproariously HERCULE POIROT is scandalized

POIROT
An old frog What can this mean
MR BLATT
Frog Froggie You know -
Frenchman
POIROT
(coldly)
I am not old and I am not a
Frenchman
MR BLATT
Eh
POIROT

Monsieur I am a Belgian

MR BLATT
I beg pardon I thought they were
all the same vieux haricot

POIROT
Pardon

MR BLATT
Vieux haricot - Old Bean - get it

He roars with laughter again towelling himself vigorously
as he does so POIROT nods in mystification

MR BLATT
Care to join me for a pre-lunch
livener

POTROT still looks bemused so MR BLATT mimes the action of
drinking

POIROT
Ah laperitif Une bonne idee

Before turning back towards the hotel POIROT looks down the
beach to where LINDA has joined her step-mother and PATRICK
REDFERN about thirty yards away The CAMERA ZOOMS in to join
them

ARLENA MARSHALL
(to Linda)
What the hell are you doing here Linda
Did your father send you to play goose-
berry chaperon or spy

LINDA MARSHALL
(panting)
I thought Id just come for a chat
Arlena I dont seem to be having
any fun

ARLENA MARSHALL
Well why dont you go back to the
hotel dahling and write out five
hundred times I must try not to look
so abysmally dowdy and if you take
your own advice you may just get to
have some

LINDA flees awkwardly away down the beach towards where
POIROT and MR BLATT are starting their walk towards the
swimming pool bar She is sobbing and cursing under her
breath

ARLENA MARSHALL
(to Patrick Redfern)
Really that girl runs like a diseased
dromedary

The CAMERA ZOOMS BACK to its previous position As she
passes POIROT and MR BLATT we hear distinctly what she is
saying

LINDA MARSHALL
The bitch I could kill her
I could kill her

POIROT shakes his head at MR BLATT who looks away in
embarrassment They continue their walk towards the bar
as the CAMERA PANS off them to where DAPHNE CASTLE is
sitting on the beach talking to KENNETH MARSHALL

DAPHNE CASTLE

KENNETH MARSHALL

KENNETH MARSHALL

KENNETH MARSHALL
Yes Its a pity about that Lindas

DAPHNE CASTLE

KENNETH MARSHALL

DAPHNE CASTLE

a full time occupation

KENNETH MARSHALL

dont approve of quick marriage and
easy divorce Arlena is my wife

arm and walks him down the beach carefully keeping the
hand which tickles his neck screened from her husband

KENNETH MARSHALL
I might just knock him down and it
wont be with anything frail or fancy
either

ARLENA MARSHALL
Dahling youre so impetuous
You know I dont care for anyone but
you

She kisses him lightly He stares blankly back at her

KENNETH MARSHALL
You know I often think Arlena that
other people are right and that Id
be much better off without you

ARLENA MARSHALL
My dahling what are you saying

KENNETH MARSHALL

towards my daughter and that you do
me no credit whatsoever

She tosses her hedd and turns away from him to busy herself
with the application of sun tan lotion

POIROT is walking along a path by the side of the hotel He
stops to listen as raised voices float out from a first floor
bedroom window

CHRISTINE REDFERN (V0)

of flowered trellis

INT THE ARBOUR NIGHT

CHRISTINE REDFERN sits on a stone bench gazing out over
the sea POIROT enters

POIROT
Forgive me if I startled you Madame

CHRISTINE REDFERN
Oh the moon I suppose everyone does

POIROT
Everyone is a moon Madame and has
a dark side which is never shown to
anybody

CHRISTINE REDFERN
Everyone except me I think I wish
I could be so secretive and not show
what I feel

Sometimes for ladies that is difficult

Do you know what Im most sick of in
this place

POIROT

CHRISTINE REDFERN
Pity I cant bear to be pitied
Everyone around here is so sorry for

with from that fool of a husband of hers

POIROT
Will you allow me to tell you something
Madame The Arlena Stuarts of this
world do not count Their domination

brains

CHRISTINE REDFERN
You cant actually believe that men
care for either of those things can

She laughs bitterly

Your husband loves you Madame I
know it

CHRISTINE REDFERN
You cant know it
POIROT
But I do Ive seen him looking at
you For Hercule Poirot such an
oeillade is enough

CHRISTINE REDFERN breaks down and weeps on POIROTs shoulder
After a while the weeping subsides

CHRISTINE REDFERN

POIROT rises from the seat he has taken during her breakdown
offers her his bandana which she gratefully accepts bows
and retires

Bible Bay to the hotel Suddenly he hears the sound of
voices coming from behind some bushes Cautiously he steps
aside to peer through

In a little clearing screened from the path by trees ARLENA
MARSHALL and PATRICK REDFERN stand close together The
latters voice is loud and clear

PATRICK REDFERN

KENNETH MARSHALL
Good evening Monsieur Poirot What

POIROT
The calm before the storm perhaps
Bon nuit

He enters the hotel and closes the door behind him We move
into a CLOSE UP of KENNETH MARSHALLs face to see it is
suffused with bitterness and rage He drives his balled
fist into the palm of the other hand making a sharp violent
sound in the still night

looks after her puzzled

INT DINING ROOM MORNING

The CAMERA PANS lovingly over a large selection of silver
chafing dishes kept warm on a series of hot plates on

the sideboard We then CUT away to see DAPHNE CASTLE
looking disapprovingly at LINDA MARSHALL who is listlessly
finishing her meagre breakfast of coffee and toast

DAPHNE CASTLE
You know you really are naughty Linda
Andrea goes to all the trouble of
preparing decent English breakfasts
instead of those weedy Continental
affairs and all you eat is toast

LINDA MARSHALL
Im sorry Im not hungry

DAPHNE CASTLE
Let me at least tempt you to Oeufs
Jolly Roger

LINDA MARSHALL
Whats that

DAPHNE CASTLE removes the cover from a dish and exhibits
it

DAPHNE CASTLE
It’s Andreas lunatic idea of pirate
gastronomy Plovers eggs served
in a sheeps skull with crossed marrow
pones Jolly tasty

LINDA MARSHALL
I just couldnt - really

DAPHNE CASTLE puts her arms round LINDA MARSHALL

DAPHNE CASTLE
Whats the matter Is it Arlena

LINDA MARSHALL

I promise you

LINDA MARSHALL
(fiercely)
Yes If you make them

EXT THE TERRACE OUTSIDE THE HOTEL MORNING

HERCULE POIROT sits at a table under a beach umbrella drinking
a cup of coffee and eating a croissant loaded with mountainous
quantities of strawberry jam DAPHNE CASTLE crosses from
the hotel and heads off in a Westerly direction towards
Lighthouse Ledge CHRISTINE REDFERN and LINDA MARSHALL set
off in a North Easterly direction towards Cutlass Cove

After a moment POIROT himself rises and moves off ina
South Westerly direction towards Booty Beach

EXT BOOTY BEACH MORNING

Booty Beach is empty save for ARLENA MARSHALL who is trying

to launch a float She is dressed in the same white bathing
suit and green cardboard Chinese hat as the day previously

POIROT appears and stands watching her

POIROT
Do you require assistance Madame

ARLENA MARSHALL gives him one of her seductive looks

ARLENA MARSHALL
Oh Monsieur Poirot would you
Im afraid its a bit too heavy
for me

POIROT walks down to the waters edge but stops when he
realises he is wearing white suede shoes Gingerly he removes
them and puts them carefully with his socks several feet
beyond the tide mark He then meticulously rolls up his
trousers to the knees and walks into the sea The float is
successfully launched and ARLENA MARSHALL holding her
paddle jumps on it

ARLENA MARSHALL
Thank you so much and Monsieur Poirot
Please dont tell anyone where Ive
gone Everyone will keep following
me about so

POIROT
Everyone Madame

ARLENA MARSHALL
Well perhaps some people more than
others But I just want to be alone

With a bright and confiding smile on her face ARLENA
MARSHALL paddles away to the Northwards

Continued
POIROT
(to himself)
Ah ca jamais That I do not

believe She is not the Mademoiselle
Garbo that one It is quite clear
whom she is going to meet

He turns and retraces his steps towards the beach His white
suede shoes float out to meet him

POIROT
Sacre Bleu The suede is ruined

POIROT wades ashore mopping unhappily at his shoes ARLENA
MARSHALLs float rounds the point and disappears A further
surprise greets POIROT as PATRICK REDFERN strolls down from
the direction of the hotel He gapes first at REDFERN then
at the point which the float has just rounded

PATRICK REDFERN
The top of the morning to you
You seem to have given your shoes
a bath

POIROT
Alas it is so

PATRICK REDFERN
You know you want to use a wire brush
on those things Salt water does them
no good at all

He laughs delightedly POIROT scowls- After a moment or

two REDFERNs mood changes and he starts to look about him
very obviously puzzled and impatient KENNETH MARSHALL

now approaches from the direction of the hotel REDFERN

eyes him apprehensively but MARSHALL more or less ignores him

KENNETH MARSHALL
Morning Monsieur Poirot Seen my
wife about

POIROT
(innocently)
Has Madame then arisen so early

KENNETH MARSHALL
Shes not in her room I think
Ill take my dip right away Ive
got a lot of typing to do this
morning Cant abide it but its
got to be done

Continued

POIROT
You are perhaps an auteur

KENNETH MARSHALL

have a better holiday if one took ones
secretary with one

PATRICK REDFERN
I wouldnt have thought that that was
such an original thought old boy

KENNETH MARSHALL
(coldly)
No I daresay you wouldnt

MARSHALL takes off his robe and puts it on the sand next to
Poirots ruined shoes

KENNETH MARSHALL
Hullo hullo hullo Been taking
‘your shoes for a swim

POIROT
(gritting his teeth)
An unfortunate wave

KENNETH MARSHALL saunters off down to the sea Behind the
back of the unamused POIROT we see and hear MR and MRS
GARDENER walking towards us PATRICK REDFERN looks up
eagerly but is obviously disappointed

POIROT
And where is Madame Redfern this
morning

PATRICK REDFERN
Who Oh I dont know I think
shes gone off sketching somewhere

MR and MRS GARDENER come up with POIROT and PATRICK REDFERN
and sit down in beach chairs MR GARDENER fusses about opening
beach umbrellas for his wife

MRS GARDENER
Good morning Mr Redfern Good morning
Monsieur Poirot

PATRICK REDFERN mumbles and POIROT bows

Have you been paddling and forgotten
to take your shoes off

46 Continued
POIROT
Very drole Madame

He smiles thinly

MRS GARDENER
A friend of ours did something like
that once in Miami Do you remember
Eileen Scholenblautwitz Odell Her
old man gave her a watch for their
wedding anniversary that must have
cost a couple of arms and a leg and
she went into the water with it When
she came out she found of course that
it wasnt working Do you remember what
she said The Godamned things stopped
at eleven diamonds past three rubies

MR GARDENER
I thought it was in the morning dear
and she said three rubies past eleven
diamonds

MRS GARDENER
(firmly)
It was in the afternoon Odell and she
said eleven diamonds past three rubies

MR GARDENER
Im sure youre right dear

We watch KENNETH MARSHALL swimming He does it well
disappearing under the surface of the water for longish
periods A BRIEF MIX indicates a small time change
Finally he walks up the beach

MRS GARDENER
Hi there Captain Marshall Wheres
Linda this morning

KENNETH MARSHALL
Linda I dont know Mooning
about the Island somewhere I expect

MRS GARDENER
You know that girl looks kinda peaky
to me You ought to give her some of
that Virol They say anaemic girls
need it Ive seen it on the hoardings

KENNETH MARSHALL finishes drying himself and puts on his robe
KENNETH MARSHALL

Lindas alright Excuse me Ive got
some work to do and its got a bit late

46 Continued

KENNETH MARSHALL walks away up the beach towards the hotel

MRS GARDENER
If you want my opinion its that
step-mother of hers thats doing her
no good We knew an only child once
whose father married again didnt
we Odell - remember Gloria
Stuhlnichsteiner She grew hair all
over her bosom

We hear the sound of someone approaching and PATRICK REDFERN
looks up hopefully obviously to see if it is APLTNA MARSHALL
and then down again sulkily as we see it is MISS BREWSTER
He rises abruptly and starts to walk up and down the beach

MISS BREWSTER
Good morning all

MRS GARDENER
Hi there

MR GARDENER
Good morning

POIROT
Bon jour Madame

MISS BREWSTER notices POIROTs spoiled shoes

MISS BREWSTER
What have you been up to Monsieur
Poirot Been trying to walk on
the water

POIROT
I leave that performance to our
Saviour Madame My own miracles
if such they can be described come
more from the exercise of the little
grey cells

She laughs

And you Madame - have you had your
swim this morning

MISS BREWSTER
Oh yes I had one about ten oclock
In fact I was lucky to survive
Somebody chucked a bottle out of
one of the hotel windows and nearly
brained me

Continued
MRS GARDENER

What a dangerous thing to do Odell

do you remember the Angelsturmer kid

who got concussion right there in Mid

town Manhattan from a can of tooth-

paste falling on his head

MR GARDENER
Are you sure it wasnt toilet cleanser
dear I had the distinct impression
that that little Dutch girl on the can
came into it somewhere

MRS GARDENER
(firmly)
Toothpaste

MISS BREWSTER
Concussion you say from a tooth-
paste tin That does seem rather
difficult to believe

MRS GARDENER
It fell from a forty fifth floor
window

MRS GARDENER chuckles to herself A silence falls They all
watch PATRICK REDFERN impatiently pacing the beach and turning
his head continually towards the direction of the hotel

MISS BREWSTER
Wheres Mrs Marshall this morning

POIROT shrugs elaborately

MRS GARDENER
I havent seen her But Mr Redfern
sure looks mighty put out

MISS BREWSTER
Yes he does but its Captain Marshall
I really feel sorry for Hes such
a quiet man - always 80 composed but
Ill bet hes actually seething inside

The CAMERA joins PATRICK REDFERN now some distance away from
the group of MR and MRS GARDENER MISS BREWSTER and HERCULE
POIROT He saunters around aiming vicious swipes at limpets
and crabs with a piece of driftwood he has picked up
Occasionally he looks up in the direction of the hotel then
falls again to abusing the marine creatures Back in the
group Miss Brewster gets to her feet

MISS BREWSTER
Well Im going for my row

Continued
POIROT
As for me I shall return to the hotel
to change my shoes It is not agreeable
to be seen in this condition

POIROT bows to the company and trudges away in the direction
of the hotel holding his wet shoes delicately in his hand
MISS BREWSTER walks along the beach in the direction of the
harbour In doing this she has to pass PATRICK REDFERN

PATRICK REDFERN
Are you taking your boat out

MISS BREWSTER
Yes

PATRICK REDFERN
Mind if I join you

MISS BREWSTER
Delighted

PATRICK REDFERN
Lets row right round the Island

MISS BREWSTER

She consults her watch

Oh yes Its not eleven thirty

They walk in the direction of the harbour

EXT THE HARBOUR AND SEA MORNING

The boat emerges from the harbour with PATRICK REDFERN rowing
with strong powerful strokes MISS BREWSTER in the stern
regards him with approval The boat turns to the North out
of the harbour so that the Island is on its right hand side
and the open sea on its left

MISS BREWSTER
Good -Lets see how long you can
keep that up for

She waves to MR and MRS GARDENER as they pass the spot on the
beach where they are sitting They wave back Then the boat
passes round the point and they are lost to sight

He digs the oars in and the boat shoots forward

SLOW MIX THROUGH TO the next scene

EXT SEABLOOD BAY FROM POV ROWING BOAT MIDDAY

The boat rounds the next point and Blood Bay comes into
view Distinctly we hear a chapel bell ringing twelve
oclock It is quite a small cove facing North West

and the beach above the water line is shadowed by a huge
overhanging cliff A float is drawn up on the beach

A figure of a woman lies sprawled out on the sand in the
shaded part WE ZOOM IN TO A CLOSE UP to see that her

face is covered by a large screen cardboard Chinese hat from
under which a long red curl escapes Bronzed limbs protrude
from a white bathing suit

PATRICK REDFERN
Hullo Whos that in Blood Bay

MISS BREWSTER
(sourly)
Lucretia Borgia

PATRICK REDFERN

He grins sheepishly and alters course inshore

MISS BREWSTER

shouting 3

He reaches the figure and kneels down beside it
Hey wake up

WE CUT INTO A CLOSE UP to see the bronzed limbs the white
bathing suit the red hair curling out from under the brim

of the green Chinese hat In the background we see MISS
BREWSTER still in the boat PATRICK REDFERN touches one oi
the bronzed arms then pulls his hand away as if stung From
MISS BREWSTERs point of view we see him lift the hat off the
face

PATRICK REDFERN
(shouting)
My God

MISS BREWSTER
Whats the matter

PATRICK REDFERN
Shes dead Shes been murdered
strangled

He drops the hat back to cover the face and runs back down
the beach to MISS BREWSTER still sitting in the boat

MISS BREWSTER

PATRICK REDFERN nods his head dumbly

MISS BREWSTER
How horrible

PATRICK REDFERN
Who could have done this to Arlena
Its just not possible My God if I
get my hands on the fiend who did this

MISS BREWSTER looks uneasily around her

MISS BREWSTER
You dont suppose hes still hanging
about do you

PATRICK REDFERN
(grimly)
I hope so

MISS BREWSTER
We must get the Police Perhaps
one of us ought to stay with the body

PATRICK REDFERN
ee Dont worry I11 stay

MISS BREWSTER sighs with relief

MISS BREWSTER
Ob thank you Ill be as quick as I

She points to an iron ladder which is clamped to the cliff
side and which leads to the top

EXT BLOOD BAY AFTERNOON

A CLOSE UP as the green Chinese hat is removed ARLENA
MARSHALLs distorted dead face stares up at us in bright
sunlight The tongue protrudes and the eyes bulge We
PULL BACK to see the middle-aged wiry Albanian Police
Surgeon DR MUSA kneeling down examining her COLONEL RACE
Stands nearby with an overweight Albanian Sergeant of
Police in a scruffy uniform Also present are PATRICK
REDFERN and MISS BREWSTER

RACE
(impatiently)
Well doctor what do you make of it

DR MUSA
She was

He demonstrates strangulation by putting his own hands
round his throat putting his tongue out and making a
hideous choking noise

RACE
Strangled

DR MUSA
Yes strangled - by big big hands

He flexes his hands dramatically

RACE
What about the time of death

DR MUSA
Three four hours dead no more

RACE
(to Sergeant)
What time is it now

58 Continued

SERGEANT
Time to eat
RACE
The hour Not the state of your

stomach
The SERGEANT holds up three fingers

SERGEANT
Three oclock

RACE
(to Redfern)
When did you find her

PATRICK REDFERN
About noon

MISS BREWSTER
It was precisely twelve oclock when
we came in here I heard the bell on
the Fishermens chapel round the
corner in Bible Bay strike the hour

DR MUSA
Good Strangled between 11 and 12
OK

He acts it out as before

RACE -
Most helpful Well send the body
over to the mainland for the post
mortem

DR MUSA
Yes Yes Chop her up later Goodbye

DR MUSA packs up his bag and with a formal bow trudges over
the sand towards the ladder and starts to climb up it

RACE
(to himself)
Competent enough I daresay but needs
to brush up his bedside manner
(to Sergeant )
Outline the position of the body will
you before it is removed

SERGEANT
Outline

RACE demonstrates with a stick

Continued

RACE
Like this

SERGEANT
OK

He starts work to outline the corpse as the CAMERA MOVES
to an EXTREME CLOSE UP of its distorted features

INT THE RESIDENTS LOUNGE HOTEL AFTERNOON
RACE and POIROT are alone in the lounge

RACE
It is absolutely extraordinary finding
you here Poirot Wherever theres a
juicy murder you seem to pop up like
a jack rabbit

POIROT
I could say the same thing about you
cher Colonel If it is not too
indiscreet of me may I enquire what
you were doing visiting le roi Zog

RACE
Dope running if you must know Theres
a chap Ive been after for years -
uses a dozen aliases Hes moving the
stuff up now from Turkey through the
Balkans and Ive had a strong tip off
hes round here at the moment Still
wed better get on with this lot It
looks a very tricky business

POIROT
It is true that most people here would
have murdered Madame Marshall avec
grande plaisir but do not worry mon
vieux The order and method of Hercule
Poirot will triumph in the end Now I
suppose you will want to start by
finding out who was the last person to
see Madame Marshall alive

RACE
Yes I have always found they are the
most suspicious

POIROT
Parbleu In this case I think you
will find that that person was me

59 Continued

RACE
What

POIROT
Mais oui Apart of course from
the murderer I helped her push her
float out from Booty Beach at about
ten forty this morning She asked
me not to tell anyone where she was
going

RACE
Why

POIROT
She said she wanted to be alone

RACE
From what I hear that was not a
desire she expressed too frequently

POIROT
My own opinion exactly But who
then did she go to meet

RACE shrugs

RACE
At any event she would have arrived
there shortly after eleven oclock -
the earliest time Dr Musa gave for
her death

POIROT
Exactement

RACE
So we can assume that she was murdered
there and not transported there after
she was killed - which I suppose limits
our suspects to those people on the
Island since anyone coming over from
the mainland would have been seen

POIROT
And no one was

RACE
Not so far as we have been able to find out

POIROT
Then let us begin with the husband if for
no other reason than that matrimonial causes
provide the motive for the majority of
female murders

INT KENNETH MARSHALLS BEDROOM AFTERNOON

Present in Kenneth Marshalls room are the CAPTAIN himself
POIROT and RACE He sits in an armchair facing RACE while
POIROT wanders round the room picking up and putting down
objects Standing against one of the walls is a desk with
papers and a typewriter on it

POIROT
So that is why we thought we would
start our enquiries with you Capitaine
Marshall A callous reason but sensible
Im sure youll agree After all you
have a very good very old fashioned
motive - jealously

KENNETH MARSHALL
You think that

RACE
Come sir It is a matter of common
knowledge here that your wife and Mr
Redfern were on terms of the greatest
intimacy

KENNETH MARSHALL
I do not listen to tittle tattle
Inspector My wife is dead and cannot
defend herself

RACE
Im not asking her to defend herself
If Im asking anybody Im asking you
Were you jealous of her

KENNETH MARSHALL
Many men have admired my wife Colonel
If I was the type of man who would kill
for jealously I would have killed her
years ago

POIROT
It has been my experience that all men
are the type of men who would kill for
jealousy You Monsieur must be tout a
fait exceptionnel Mes felicitations

KENNETH MARSHALL shrugs with irritation and turns away from
POIROT

KENNETH MARSHALL
(to Race)
Have you any questions to ask me

60 Continued
RACE
I would like an account of your move--
ments this morning please between
eleven and twelve oclock

KENNETH MARSHALL
Its quite simple I was in here typing
until I changed to play tennis a few
minutes after twelve oclock

He rises and crosses to the desk from which he picks up three
letters

KENNETH MARSHALL
Here they are If you put one of your
men to type them you will find he
wont be able to do them in much under
an hour
(to himself)
Where is that damned pipe

He hands the letters to RACE and then pats his pockets for
his pipe Finding them empty he goes to search for it is a
random manner amongst his tobacco pouch matches and cleaners
on the desk He fails to find it and gives up

RACE
What is there to show that they could
not have been typed at some other time
- say last night for example

KENNETH MARSHALL
Today is the twenty-fifth As you will
see these letters are postdated in
answer to this one from my stockbroker
posted in London the twenty-third and
arriving here on this mornings post at
about ten thirty As I was down on
Booty Beach with you Monsieur Poirot
at a little after ten forty five you
will see clearly that I must have typed
them when I said I did

POIROT
It would appear so

KENNETH MARSHALL
Well if youre still not satisfied why
not ask the chambermaid if she heard the
machine going She was moving about the
corridor some of the time doing out other
rooms

RACE
Thank you Captain Marshall Well do that
Now can you tell us what you did after
youd finished typing

Continued

KENNETH MARSHALL
As I said I went to play tennis The
date was for twelve fifteen

Did she seem quite normal

KENNETH MARSHALL
I dont suppose youve seen anything
of Arlena this morning have you I
havent seen her since breakfast

KENNETH MARSHALL (V0O)

DAPHNE CASTLE
I saw her on a float earlier this
morning I think shes up the North
end of the Island somewhere

KENNETH MARSHALL
Was she with anyone

61 Continued

DAPHNE CASTLE
No She was alone Though she was
probably heading for some sleazy
rendezvous with her leprechaun lover
Oh Ken its not right for you to let
her torture you this way

RACE (V0)
I mean did she look agitated or flushed
or excited in any way

KENNETH MARSHALL
Dont be silly Daphne You do exagger-
ate everything so Arlena may be a
bit of a flirt but she knows where to
draw the line

KENNETH MARSHALL (V0O)
No I dont think so She looked her
usual soigne self

DAPHNE CASTLE
The only line Arlenas drawn is under
a column of figures

KENNETH MARSHALL
Drop it will you Heres Gardener

KENNETH MARSHALL (VO)
Mr Gardener He must have been about
five or six minutes late

DAPHNE CASTLE
How about a knock up

MR GARDENER
(mock scandalized)
A knock up

61 Continued
DAPHNE CASTLE
Yes You know - a spot of practice till
Mrs Redfern comes

MR GARDENER
Oh You should know that in my country
a knock up means something totally
different

DAPHNE CASTLE
Oh really Surely you cant mean jolly
rogering

They laugh and start to play

RACE (V0O)
And how did Mr Gardener look

KENNETH MARSHALL (VO)
As he always does - like a sober up-
right henpecked New York attorney

RACE (V0O)

before Mrs Redfern arrived

in any way though of course she had
been hurrying

RACE
Thank you sir

KENNETH MARSHALL
Anything else

POIROT
Just two things Monsieur Firstly will
these letters show your investments to
have been profitable

KENNETH MARSHALL
No Im afraid they will reveal I have
sustained some substantial losses recently

POIROT
Secondly is it true that your wife had
quite a lot of money of her own

KENNETH MARSHALL
She inherited some money recently - yes

POIROT
Did she leave a will

KENNETH MARSHALL
Yes Alright I succeed to her property

She was always on at me taunting me
making me look foolish and childish She
was so cruel so cruel

But anyhow wishing someone dead isnt
the same thing as doing it is it

does have an usually strong pair of
hands for a girl of her age

RACE
Alright Ill accept that What did
you think about her father

POIROT
Le bon Capitaine would be more
prudent to cultivate an air of
greater tristesse if he does not
wish to be suspected of her death

RACE
Perhaps youre right Well Ill get
the sergeant to work on the type-
writer alibi - see if he can do them
in under an hour - and then we should
have a word with Valentino

EXT SWIMMING POOL AFTERNOON

ln a series of quick cuts we watch PATRICK REDFERN executing
ever higher and more elaborate dives into theswimming pool
POIROT watches thoughtfully from a concealed place in the
arborial surroundings He is joined by RACE

RACE
Very impressive stuff eh Monsieur
Poirot He should be in training
for the Berlin Olympics

POIROT
Mais oui Those I should like to
see They say there is an American
Negro - a man called Jesse Owens -
who is absolument formidable

RACE
Its funny but he too doesnt look
to me much like a man who has just
lost his lady love

POIROT
You think he is celebrating Cest
possible

PATRICK REDFERN does a final dive swims to the pools edge
and climbs out POIROT and RACE move out from their cover
to confront him

POTROT
Good afternoon Monsieur Redfern
Colonel Race here is of the opinion
that vous avez un coeur leger

PATRICK REDFERN
And what might that mean

POIROT
That you are gay — lighthearted

PATRICK REDFERN
Lighthearted If I didnt do some-
thing I think Id go off my chump
Whats happened is so unbelievable

POIROT
Not in my experience monsieur I
find it quite believable

PATRICK REDFERN

(savagely)
Obviously you are more accustomed to
murder than I am Monsieur Poirot

You have probably seen quite a few
in your time and have learnt how to
behave

POIROT
Vraiment and they have also given
me many opportunities of observing how
suspects behave And I can assure
you that very few of them have been
blithe

POIROT and PATRICK REDFERN glare at each other before the
latter moves to put on his bathing robe and sit down at a
poolside table

RACE
Mr Redfern may I ask how long you
had known Mrs Marshall

PATRICK REDFERN
About three months We met at a cocktail
party in London

RACE
And had you agreed to meet down here
or was it mere coincidence

70 Continued

PATRICK REDFERN
No I must admit it was not coincidence
She asked me to come and I suppose I
couldnt resist You see I was infatu-
ated with her Id have done any mortal
thing the asked

POIROT
You paint a very clear picture of her
She was the eternal Circe nest ce pas

PATRICK REDFERN
(rueful)
She turned men into swine alright You
see deep down I know I love my wife

POIROT
Well mon vieux that does rather
establish a motive for the murder nest
ce pas

PATRICK REDFERN
A motive - for me Holy Mother of God
why should I have wanted her dead I
was crazy about her

POIROT
So you say But it is possible she had
become too importunate and was making
it impossible for you to return to the
wife you loved Many women have been
killed in this world for no other reason
than that they became a nuisance

PATRICK REDFERN

I assure you it wasnt like that at all

I could have taken off any time I wanted
to Anyway what are you saying That it
was me who killed her You must know that
couldnt possibly be the case Wasnt I
with yourself the whole time till I went
on with Miss Brewster and found her lying

dead

POIROT
So Monsieur it is I who am to be your
alibi

PATRICK REDFERN
Isnt it true

POIROT spreads his hands in a gesture of capitulation

POIROT
Helas - oui

70 Continued
PATRICK REDFERN
Well there you are then

POIROT
Eh bien Whom do you think she had
gone to meet at Blood Bay

PATRICK REDFERN
I really havent the faintest idea

POIROT
How about your wife She had a good motive
for killing Madame Marshall

PATRICK REDFERN
What

POIROT
Absolument La Jalousie

PATRICK REDFERN
What nonsense Theres no violence in
her Besides how could she have done
it Shed never have been able to climb
down that ladder to the beach - shes no
head for that sort of thing at all - And
even if she could have she was no match
for Arlena Shed have been the one to
have been murdered No if its jealousy
youre after Id have a go at Ken Marshall
He must be favourite Now is that all

POIROT
For the moment yes But please hold your-
self in readiness to reconstruct for us
tomorrow morning your finding of Arlena
Marshalls body with Mademoiselle Brewster

PATRICK REDFERN walks away towards the hotel

Suddenly there is a cracking of twigs in the bushes behind
where the two men are sitting In a flash COLONEL RACE has
risen and parted them to discover DAPHNE CASTLE crouched down
in a position from where she has been able to overhear every-
thing She rises insouciantly and steps out favouring both
men with a radiant smile

DAPHNE CASTLE
Youre absolutely on the right track Monsieur
Poirot Cherchez la temme Shes the
one with the best motive Captain Marshall
Simply isnt the type

POIROT
So you have been heavesdropping Madame

DAPHNE CASTLE
Now dont be tiresome Monsieur Poirot
Everyone heavesdrops if theyve got any
sense As a detective you must do it all

tha time

Continued
POIROT
Madame I assure you that Hercule Poirot
has no need

DAPHNE CASTLE
And dont you believe all that guff about
Arlena being the strongerWomen fight like
tigers when theyre losing their husbands
- not that Ive had too much experience
of that sort of thing myself I mean I
tried everything to get rid of Johnnie -
strychnine in the spuds - bolting to South
America but he clung on like a limpet
If the market crash in 29 hadnt given
him a coronary hed be here now Still it
showed where his heart was

POIROT
Merci madame We will heed your advice

DAPHNE CASTLE
You do that She probably battered her
with a bit of driftwood or something and
then finished her off with a little pressure
on the carot artery or whatever its called
Everyone knows about that - all the crime
novels are full of it In fact an eleven
year old child did something like that only
the other day in Hungary - or was it Crete
Anyway Ive got to see about dinner
Au revoir

They watch in silence as she walks away towards the hotel

RACE
Do you think she was serious about putting
strychnine in her husbands food I mean
if shes killed once

POTROT

She could have killed Madame Marshall
Cest possible She certainly has the

motive
RACE
Really What might that be
POIROT
(thoughtfully)

To become herself Madame Marshall

stiff lip

CHRISTINE REDFERN

POIROT
Just a few questions But please do not
derange your game

CHRISTINE REDFERN

RACE
Perhaps you could tell us something about
how you spent this morning

They walk towards where the golf ball lies in deep rough

CHRISTINE REDFERN
Well first thing this morning at about
eight-thirty I went into Linda Marshalls

POIROT RACE and CHRISTINE REDFERN have moved about forty yards
from where they were at the end of scene 71 The golf ball is
in even thicker rough

CHRISTINE REDFERN
we heard about Mrs Marshall

POIROT
Madame I must Sk you were you very
surprised at the manner of Madame
Marshalls death

CHRISTINE REDFERN
Well of course to be around when an
actual murder is committed is so rare
that of course it is surprising - sur-
prising and shocking But I suppose she
was the kind of woman

POIROT
To whom such a thing might happen
Yes I find that very significant

CHRISTINE REDFERN
Well I mean to say its true After all
people like her are always mixed up with
everything thats squalid and sordid -
blackmail jealousy violence - every
kind of crude emotion

POIROT
Why Madame did you mention the word
blackmail

80 Continued

CHRISTINE REDFERN
Er I dont know

POIROT
Come you were quite specific To your
knowledge was Madame Marshall being
blackmailed

There is a tiny pause during which CHRISTINE REDFERN comes to
a decision

CHRISTINE REDFERN
Yes Monsieur Poirot Im afraid she
was

RACE
What

CHRISTINE REDFERN
I didnt mean to overhear but I couldnt
help it It was yesterday afternoon I
was coming back from a walk along Mutiny
Mile and as I passed along the cliff above
Blood Bay I heard voices coming up from the
beach Arlena Marshall was saying Its no
use pressing me I simply havent got it to
give you any more As it is my husband is
getting suspicious And another voice - a
mans said What rubbish Youll pay up or
Ill really make things hot for you

POIROT
(sarcastic)
Youll pay up or Ill really make things
hot for you

CHRISTINE REDFERN
Thats what he said

POIROT
Parbleu He must have been listening to
too many blackmailers

CHRISTINE REDFERN
(hotly)
Im sorry you think its a cliché Monsieur
Poirot but those were the words used

RACE
Did you recognize his voice

CHRISTINE REDFERN
No He was keeping it low But it was
gruff and a bit hoarse

Continued
RACE
And thats all you heard

CHRISTINE REDFERN
Yes Im afraid I walked on rather
quickly It was a bit embarrassing you
see

RACE
Yes I can quite see that Thank you
Mrs Redfern Well follow it up

She smiles weakly at them and hacks furiously at her ball
Turf flies through the air as POIROT and RACE beat a retreat

RACE

Now we are getting somewhere
POIROT

You think so
RACE

Well it does explain Mrs Marshalls
seemingly inexplicable behaviour this
morning doesnt it Blood Bay is an
ideal spot for a rendezvous with this
fellow whos blackmailing her Its
accessible only by water or a ladder
steep enough to deter most people and
a great part of it is invisible from
above

POIROT
As you say it is an ideal spot for a
rendezvous But explain this to me
mon cher Why is it not the pitiless
and urgent blackmailer who lies dead
but his victim Is this not indeed
killing loie qui depose les oeufs dors

RACE regards POIROT with surprise He is obviously impressed
by Poirots point The CAMERA PULLS UP and away

EXT THE CROQUET LAWN AFTERNOON

MR and MRS GARDENER are playing croquet Once again from a
concealed position POIROT and RACE stand watching MRS
GARDENER whacks her husbands ball so that it goes scudding
away into the bushes

MRS GARDENER
Now Odell I get another turn for
hitting you

She takes another shot and goes through a hoop

And I get another one for going through
the hoop

She knocks her ball towards the next hoop MR GARDENER trudges
off to retrieve his ball He plays a good shot which puts it
back near his wifes ball She whacks it away in another
direction but by doing so puts her own out of position to get
through the hoop As her husbands back is turned while he
goes to retrieve his own ball she quite blatantly cheats
moving her ball so that she can easily manoeuvre it through the
hoop She does this then whacks it joyfully up towards the
finishing post MR GARDENER looks on in a defeated way from
the bushes where his ball is

MR GARDENER
I thought we agreed one had to go
through the hoop at the top again
before finishing dear

MRS GARDENER
You are quite in error Odell We agreed
no such thing
She hits the finishing post with her ball and wins the game

Come along Ill give you one more
game

POIROT and RACE emerge from their place of concealment and
approach MRS GARDENER Her husband has quite a long walk
back from the bushes to join them

MRS GARDENER
Hullo there Monsieur Poirot How goes
the investigation

POIROT
It marches Madame It marches Let me
introduce you to my colleague Colonel
Race - Mr and Mrs Gardener

RACE smiles charmingly

RACE
How do you do

MRS GARDENER
My you British bobbies are all so
charming and sympathetic I remember
I lost a bracelet once at the Savoy -
we thought it had been stolen - and a
delightful young officer came and found
it in a vase of roses where it must have
fallen from my wrist when I was arranging
them I thought hed have been mad as hell
wasting his time and all But not a bit
of it

MR GARDENER
It wasnt a vase of roses honey It
was a jardiniere in the fireplace

MRS GARDENER

It was a vase of roses Odell Red long
stemmed roses that Hattie Hymenheimer
had sent to us Surely you remember how
she and Betty Bernlumbenwitz had sobbed
all the way through Carole Lombard in
“Lady By Choice - Men who loved her
grew sadder but wiser

MR GARDENER
My recollection is that they brought us
Arum Lilies and that it was Joan Bennett
in While Paris Sleeps they sobbed
through Dont you remember - While Paris
Sleeps Lovers Wantons and Wastrels are
Awake

oclock

MRS GARDENER
Well now let me see Odell and I were
on Booty Beach the whole time I guess

You were there

POIROT
Alas Madame the statement is not quite
true I took my departure from the
beach a little before half past eleven
as did Mademoiselle Brewster and Monsieur
Redfern That left the two of you alone

MRS GARDENER laughs shrilly and exaggeratedly

MRS GARDENER
Gee I guess it does Still you cant
really think that Odell and I had anything
to do with the death of that unfortunate
woman Monsieur Poirot now can you

We have to investigate everyone here

MRS GARDENER

of opinion here

MR GARDENER
Well to tell the truth we invested ina
Musical Comedy she did in the States last
year We met her then

RACE
Was it a successful show

MR GARDENER
Hell no But it had a kind of appropriate
name - Gold Diggers of 1934 You see it
could have been successful but she left it
after a few weeks to go off with some oleo
-margarine King and it folded

RACE “
As a result of which you lost your money

MR GARDENER
Ill say we did

RACE
May I ask how much money you lost

MRS GARDENER
Sixty thousand clams

RACE whistles

POIROT
And so you bore Madame Marshall a grudge

MRS GARDENER
Well wouldnt you have But not enough
to bump her off Thats crazy talk

POIROT
I hope for your sake it is Madame For
you see you would have had all the time
in the world to go to Blood Bay between
eleven thirty and twelve oclock and

But that is not the complete truth You
have already told me that you were em-
ployed as Arlena Marshalls secretary

you nothing - no references no help In
fact she used every device in her power
to prevent you telling the truth about her
What I wonder could you have meant by that —

MISS BREWSTER climbs out of the boat onto the jetty to confront
POIROT

MISS BREWSTER

Monsieur Poirot I have my skills as a
secretary but as you may have noticed
I am not a pretty girl from Pitmans
College who finds it easy to get a job
anywhere at three or four pounds the
week So after I was dismissed I wrote
an account of my life with Mrs Marshall

hoping to serialise it in the tabloid
press I called it The Secret Life of
Arlena Stuart - by her Personal Secretary

generous offers to publish both here and
in America but she stopped me

signed a contract of employment one clause
of which prevented me from publishing any-
thing about my former employer whilst

shoulder reading what he has typed

POIROT and RACE appear and walk across the terrace towards
them

RACE
Well hows it going Sergeant

SERGEANT
Is taking a long time - much more than
one hour to do this

DAPHNE CASTLE
Hullo Whats the poor man trying to do -
break the Albanian speed typing record

She picks up a couple of letters at random and starts to
read them We notice that her hands also are large

POIROT
He is trying to prove an alibi madame

DAPHNE CASTLE
Whose Kenneth Marshalls If his wife
was wealthy he certainly needs one poor
love Was she wealthy by the way

POIROT
It appears so but why do you ask that

DAPHNE CASTLE
Well look at these letters Spondulix
wise he appears to be up shit creek with-
out a paddle

POIROT
Pardon Qu est ce que cest cette Sheet
Creek

RACE

I think Mrs Castle means to imply that
Captain Marshall-is in financial
difficulties

POIROT
Mais oui That he has already told us

DAPHNE CASTLE
Still Ken never cared about money I
only hope youre satisfied with his alibi

POIROT
Certainment we know these letters had to
have been typed between eleven and twelve
oclock this morning - the time of the
murder

RACE
He also claims one of the maids who was
cleaning the rooms must have heard the
sound of the typewriter

DAPHNE CASTLE
Well there it is Ken certainly isnt
clever enough to use the old gramophone
record trick - you know the one where
the murderer records the sound of a type-
writer puts it on the gramophone and
nips out and bops his wife while everyone
thinks hes still in his room

POIROT and RACE give her the kind of looks they would bestow
on a mentally deficient child

POIROT
And of course a gramophone does not
actually type letters madame

DAPHNE CASTLE
No more it does Silly me

Well you can pack it in now The points
proved Instead I think you should take a
little exercise

to reveal a scale model otf the island beautifully worked in
coloured plaster It shows the bays paths harbour light- 7
house chapel and hotel all named with little flags showing
the times to various places sticking up all over it

DAPHNE CASTLE
There you are An old chum of mine did it
a couple of years ago when he had a little
trouble paying his bill Be careful of it -
its worth its weight in caviar

We move into an ECU of the model as the two men bend to examine
it RACE points to the flags

RACE
And these times are walking times

DAPHNE CASTLE
Slouching times Id have said

I mean fifty minutes from the hotel to
the point of the island If you jogged
all the way you could do it in half the
time

minutes to Bounty Beach Ten minutes to
Blood Bay Seven minutes to Lighthouse
Ledge From the Ledge to the Bay five
minutes From the Beach to the Bay
twelve minutes and from the Bay to
Cutlass Cove four minutes

Astounding mental arithmetic cher Colonel
I stand amazed Eh maintenant I would
like your Sergeant to prepare more little
flags for us with the names of the hotel
guests on them to use with this superb
model It will greatly facilitate our
enquiry

RACE
Ill get him on to it

DAPHNE CASTLE
Monsieur Poirot I dont wish to be
seeming to teach my grandmother to suck
eggs or anything but Ive changed my
mind about the murderer You see I was
reading a magazine story about a woman
in Malaya who was drowned by a huge
Moray Eel which darted out of a hole
and dragged her to the ocean floor its
teeth buried in her throat and that
gave me a new theory - about the Brewster
woman - Did you know by the way she was
Arlenas secretary for years and was fired
Well anyway she could have been lurking
in the water off Blood Bay when she appeared
on that float thing and could have leapt
up and pulled her off it

POIROT
Helas Madame Marshall was not drowned
madame Still less was she gnawed to
death

DAPHNE CASTLE
Well Ill tell you what She could have

routine I should like to know where you were
yourself between eleven oclock and twelve noon

You would have had plenty of time to have
returned here for the meeting at eleven
thirty nest ce pas

What a simply spifflicatingly absurd
thing to say Monsieur Poirot

at Captaine Marshall Madame and it
seems to me that both you and he share
the same motive

all

Vraiment With Arlena out of the way
you two would be free to marry

DAPHNE CASTLE

Me kill for love I must say its very
flattering of you to suggest it but

Im afraid Im far too much of a hardened
old trollop for that and as for Kenneth
hed never do it in a million years Why
he wouldnt even contemplate divorce when
he must have known about every second man
she met was throwing a leg over her

sweetheart again after seventeen years

have committed murder in the previous
hour

to your question everybody appeared to
me to be perfectly normal I dont
believe any one of them could have just
strangled somebody

POIROT (V0)
Thank you Madame

RACE (V0)
I believe Mr Gardener was the next to
arrive How much behind you was he

DAPHNE CASTLE (V0O)
Im not sure Not long Maybe three
or four minutes

A QUICK MIX to indicate the passing of time CHRISTINE REDFERN
hurries onto the court and walks over to join MR GARDENER

couldnt have been on court much before

at the end of scene 96

POIROT
Who won the tennis by the way

DAPHNE CASTLE is as surprised by the question as RACE

DAPHNE CASTLE
What Oh they did Mrs R can sure hit
the jolly old pill as if she hated it
If you ask me those milk white arms could
mince the triceps of a six hundred pound
Sumo wrestler

POIROT has walked round to peer down a telescope mounted
on a tripod which is pointing out towards the harbour

POIROT
Ah a sail

INSERT EXT THE SEA

We see through the telescope MR BLATTs sailing boat heading
towards the island

POIROT (V0)
I think it might be our gallant
mariner Monsieur Blatt

INT SMALL CONSERVATORY AFTERNOON
POIROT steps away from the telescope and turns to RACE

POIROT
Ive been wondering where hes been
all day Let us go down and pipe
him ashore Au revoir Madame

POIROT and RACE head towards the foyer of the hotel

DAPHNE CASTLE
Of course Id forgotten Mr Blatt
Hes obviously playing a double role
with all those terrible jokes and
everything I wouldnt mind betting
hes an old flame Arlene picked up years
ago when she was playing Blackpool
or Skegness or some other frightful
sea side resort and got her hooks
into and reduced to penury He meets
her here by chance and vows vengeance

INT FOYER HOTEL AFTERNOON

POIROT and RACE keep going determinedly across the foyer
and out of the hotel pursued by DAPHNE CASTLEs wild surmises

DAPHNE CASTLE (V0O)
-»- He would find it quite easy to sail
round the island and strangle her with
one of those clever nautical knots

103 EXT THE HARBOUR EVENING

The time is now seven oclock BILL THE BOATMAN is making fast
Mr Blatts yawl for him As POIROT and RACE approach the two
men it becomes clear that he is telling a dirty story

MR BLATT
You see this old feller all bent over
goes into an Ice Cream Parlour and says
to the soda jerk Ice Cream Sundae please
He replies Crushed nuts Grandad and
the old bloke says No lad Its rheumatism

MR BLATT laughs loudly and walks up the jetty towards POIROT
and RACE Behind them BILL shakes his head in baffled
incomprehension

MR BLATT
Hullo Monsewer Old Bill just told me
about the murder I would have to be
out on my boat for the day and miss
all the fun wouldnt I What a swiz

POIROT
This is Colonel Race Monsieur Blatt I
dont think you will discover that he
finds it quite as hilarious as you do

MR BLATT
Well I didnt mean

RACE
You say you went out sailing this morning
At what time may 1 ask

MR BLATT

Oh early About ten oclock
RACE

Was anyone with you
MR BLATT

Not a soul I was all on my little owneo
RACE

And where did you go
MR BLATT

South West The wind was right behind me
POIROT

You didnt happen to approach Blood Bay
at any time during the morning did you

MR BLATT
Is that where the dark deed was done No
I didnt go within miles of the Place As a
matter of fact I havent seen anyone all day
103 Continued

POIROT
And thats all you can tell us

MR BLATT
Fraid so Not much use I suppose

POIROT
Have you any ideas who could have done it

MR BLATT
Well its obvious isnt it Cherchez le
hubby

POIROT
It may be so yes All we know for certain
is that Madame Marshall had a secret rendez-
vous with someone at Blood Bay this morning

MR BLATT
Well that had to be Redfern Though why
pick a draughty cove for a bit of nooky
beats me Reminds me of the old one about
the wife watching her old man coming out of
the sea and saying to her friend Fred goes
all blue and stiff when hes been in the
water - not that I worry about the colour

Once again MR BLATT cracks up laughing POIROT regards him
quizzically RACE coldly

RACE
It wasnt Mr Redfern We know that for a
fact It was somebody else - a blackmailer
for example °

MR BLATT
(blustering)
A blackmailer Wotcher mean

RACE
(heavily)
We believe she was being blackmailed -
by a man

MR BLATT
Well dont look at me Thats not my
handwriting

POIROT

How do you make your money Monsieur Blatt

MR BLATT
Its all perfectly legit Im in what you
might call Seaside Novelties - you know
tricks puzzles saucy hats and picture
post cards

POIROT
(murmuring)
Quelle surprise

MR BLATT
Listen if it wasnt Redfern and it wasnt
Marshall Ill bet I know who it was Has
to be She said she was going to do it
Dont you remember you were with me on the
beach yesterday morning when she ran past

POIROT
You mean Mademoiselle Linda Vraiment She
did certainly threaten to kill her step-
mother But shes so young

MR BLATT
Theres no such thing these days You
mark my words Shes the one

A CLOSE UP of a pile of frilly underwear We PULL BACL to see
the maid GLADYS NORRACOTT sorting them out and tidying them
away POIROT and RACE appear in the doorway

RACE
Excuse me

GLADYS NORRACOTT jumps

GLADYS NORRACOTT
Oooooh Lord you startied me

RACE
Sorry Is your name Gladys Norracott

GLADYS NORRACOTT
Yes thats me I were just putting away
some of Mrs Marshalls things I must say
her smalls werent ‘arf frilly

POIROTs eyes gleam as he fingers the pile

POIROT
Ah yes the foamy cami-knickers swirling
half seen beneath the dramatically severe
lines of the day suits Extraordinaire

104 Continued

GLADYS NORRACOTT gives POIROT a sharp suspicious look and
snatching the lingerie away from him starts to pack it into
the wardrobe

GLADYS NORRACOTT
(sharply)
Was there something sir

POIROT
I understand that you were on duty on
this floor between eleven and twelve
oclock this morning

GLADYS NORRACOTT
Not after eleven thirty I wasnt I had
to go to a staff meeting didnt I

POIROT
Well before you left for your meeting did
you hear the sound of a typewriter coming
from Captain Marshalls bedroom

GLADYS NORRACOTT
Yes I heard him typing away quite steady

POIROTs gaze travels to a huge array of cosmetic bottles lined
up on the dressing table Identifiable but not over prominent
is a bottle of perfume labelled Souffle De Mer

POIROT
Now I want you to take a look at these
bottles Can you tell me if any are
missing

She stares helplessly at them

GLADYS NORRACOTT
Lord sir youd have to have the memory
of an helephant to be able to tell that

POIROT
What about the other rooms where I pre-
sume there are somewhat fewer bottles

GLADYS NORRACOTT
I cant say I noticed nothing What kind
of a bottie might it be

POIROT
Alas that I cannot tell you Eh maintenant
one last thing I want you to cast about in
your mind to see if there is anything odd
that you can remember as having happened

Continued

She looks

POIROT (Cont)
this morning which you might have noticed
and have forgotten to tell us

GLADYS NORRACOTT
Odd sir

POIROT
Yes Gladys Odd Unusual Out of place
Different to the normal run of things

at him with a doltish expression on her face

waits patiently

GLADYS NORRACOTT
Well there was one thing though it was
nothing really Just someone having a bath
a bit after twelve oclock I mean thats
odd or unusual isnt it Most people have
baths in the early morning or in the
evening but not in the middle of the day

POIROT
Who had this bath

GLADYS NORRACOTT
I reelly couldnt say I just heard it
going down the waste thats all

POIROT
Youre sure it was a bath - not one of
the hand basins

GLADYS NORRACOTT
Quite sure I mean you cant mistake bath
water running away now can you It makes
a kind of gurgling sound

POIROT
Like someone choking

GLADYS NORRACOTT
Sort of yes

POIROT
Or being strangled

POIROT

She looks at him wide-eyed her hand flying to her mouth

DAPHNE CASTLE appears in the doorway

NORRACOTT

DAPHNE CASTLE
Do get on with your work Gladys Youre
not paid to gawp

and sees only GLADYS

104 Continued
GLADYS NORRACOTT hurries out DAPHNE CASTLE now sees POIROT

DAPHNE CASTLE
Oh its you Monsieur Poirot

POIROT
A votre service Madame

DAPHNE CASTLE
Im afraid its no use questioning Gladys
about anything Shes as dense as dough

POIROT
I have not found it so Madame

DAPHNE CASTLE
Really Well have you arrested anyone
yet I told you who it was

POIROT
Your choice of murderer has so far been
somewhat extensive

DAPHNE CASTLE
Has it Well I cant stop now and
sort it out for you Ive simply got
to keep an eye on Andrea Hes making
a curry de Poulet Vindaloos for dinner
and the last time he cooked it it was
so hot we practically had to call the
fire brigade from the mainland
Arriverdutch as they say in Holland

POJROT
Au revoir encore Madame

She bustles out RACE and POIROT follow slowly

RACE
Shes quite potty Shell be accusing
us next
POIROT

Do not distress yourself about Madame
Castle mon vieux Order and method
will prevail

RACE
I sincerely hope so but then why all
these irrelevant questions of yours
about baths and bottles

They walk through the door

105 INT THE MAIN LANDING OF THE HOTEL EVENING
POIROT and RACE walk out onto the main -landing

POIROT
There is nothing irrelevant zxbout
my questions je vous assure
They are eminently the most logical
If you have an empty bottle on your
dressing table or in your bathroon
what do you do with it Do you drop
it in the waste paper basket or do
you go to the trouble of going out
onto your balcony and hurling it into
the sea

RACE
Hm I see what you mean You would
only do that if you didnt want to
be connected with it

POIROT
Exactement

RACE
And the bath What is so strange
about the bath

POIROT
The time - a little after twelve
oclock Consider which of the
guests were in the hotel at that
hour Madame Redfern Monsieur
Gardener Madame Castle
and Capitaine Marshall They were
all about to play tennis - a curious
time to choose to take a bath nest
ce pas See you at le dejeuner

POIROT heads off to his room to change for dinner leaving
RACE to descend the stairs thoughtfully

106 INT THE DINING ROOM OF THE HOTEL NIGET

All the guests are seated at the table eating the curried
chicken BERT and CHARLIE are the waiters in attendance

MISS BREWSTER
By George this is hot - but absolutely
super
on™

He laughs

MR BLATT
Youre right Its hotter than a
night in a Mexican whorehouse

The others ignore him

MRS GARDENER
I hope youre not going to be ill
Odell like poor Mrs Auschsteiner-
boltzs girl Sadie Do you remember
how she was when she ate the hot
chillies in Alberquque

MR GANDDNGR
Dear I thought it was Gazpachio in
Mexico City

MRS GARDENER
It was hot chillies in Alberquque

-and all night long she was up and

down to the john which was about
half a mile away

DAPHNE CASTLE
Are you sure it wasnt an earth
closet Mrs Gardener

She smiles insouciantly at MRS GARDENER who glares back

LINDA MARSHALL
(to Bert)
Could I please have a glass of iced
water

KENNETH MARSHALL
Good idea For me too please About
a gallon of it

A chorus of Me toos POIROT rises to his feet

POIROT
Mesdames Monsieurs talking of water
I would like to disturb you all from
the excellence of your dinner for a
moment by asking you just one simple
question which may have some bearing
on our murder Did any of you have a
bath this morning about midday or a
few minutes later

106 Continued

The CAMERA moves round the circle of faces They all shake
their heads POIROT turns to RACE

POIROT
Voila Another little mystery to
torture the logical mind A bath
poured out which no one will admit
to taking

(to the Company)
Please continue to consume the dish
of the incomparable Andrea and
leave to my little grey cells the
elucidation of the puzzle why
cleanliness is not next to truthfulness

He taps his forehead and resume his seat as we FADE TO BLACK

407 EXT TOP OF CLIFF ABOVE BLOOD BAYCLIFF LADDER MIDDAY

RACE is finishing strapping an apprehensive POIROT into a
Bosuns chair on the cliff top He crosses himself
devoutly as he is swung out over the side of the cliff and
lowered by the SERGEANT RACE himself descends into the bay
by the iron ladder clamped to the cliff face enjoying as

he does so the grotesque sight of his colleague swinging
around in the air above his head like a helpless whale

POIROT
Ma foie Quelle vie de boheme
RACE
(calling)
Whats that you say
POIROT
(testy)
I said my liver What a life of a
Bohemian
RACE
(calling)

I wouldnt be worrying about Bohemians
if I were you at this moment Id
just hang on tight

POIROT looks down and nearly faints with terror at the sheer
drop below his dangling feet

POIROT
Quel horreur

RACE
Dont look down

107 Continued

RACE climbs smartly down the ladder singing blithely

RACE
(singing)
He flies through the air with the greatest of ease
That daring vieux Belge on the flying trapeze

POIROT
Mais cest bien impudent tout cela

RACE leaps off the ladder and is in time to catch the wildly
gyrating POIROT and release him from his harness

RACE
Well done Poirot That should have
juiced up the little grey cells for you

POIROT
They have not been juiced They have
been paralysed

After considerable attention to his toilet POIROT recovers
himself enough to take an interest in his surroundings As
the sergeant descends the iron ladder he walks over to the
taped outline figure lying above the waterline in the shade
of the overhanging cliff The green Chinese hat lies over the
spot where the face would be and the white bathing costume

is spread out over the trunk of the body He studies it
intently Behind him the sergeant picks up a couple of objects
‘from the beach

SERGEANT
I have found these on the sand

He holds out a pair of scissors and a pipe stem POIROT
and RACE study them curiously

RACE
Right Hang on to them will you
(to Poirot)
Do you think theyre significant

POIROT
Mais oui As significant as a wristwatch
a bathing cap a bottle a bath

The bell on the fishermens chapel round the corner in Bible
Bay sounds twelve oclock faintly

and the chapel bell
(he looks at his watch)
Bon It is precisely the same time as
yesterday when the body was discovered

107 Continued

PATRICK REDFERN rows the boat with his passenger MISS BREWSTER
in the stern round the point and in towards the shore
PATRICK REDFERN jumps out and runs up the beach

RACE
Well done You are precisely on time
Now remember you are to do exactly as
you did before

PATRICK REDFERN
I shouted to her I think

RACE
Good Well off you go

PATRICK REDFERN
(shouting)
Arlena Arlena Hi there

PATRICK REDFERN runs on up the beach waving and shouting
Hi there Arlena

He reaches the figure and kneels down beside it
Hey wake up

PATRICK REDFERN touches one of the outline limbs and then

sharply pulls his hand away as if stung He lifts the hat off
the face

PATRICK REDFERN
(shouting)
My God

MISS BREWSTER
Whats the matter

PATRICK REDFERN
Shes dead Shes been murdered
strangled

He drops the hat back to cover where the face would be and

runs down to MISS BREWSTER who is sitting in the boat holding
the oars

MISS BREWSTER
Are you sure

PATRICK REDFERN nods his head dumbly

How horrible

PATRICK REDFERN
Who could have done this to Arlena
just not possible

- Its

107 Continued

PATRICK REDFERN looks at POIROT who has been watching the
reconstruction with great attention
PATRICK REDFERN

We stayed like this for a minute or so

You see we were shocked We didnt know

what to do Then in case the murderer

was still hanging about I volunteered to

stay with the body while Miss Brewster went

to fetch the police I touched nothing

other than to make sure she was dead

MISS BREWSTER
And I rowed away back to the hotel I
couldnt cope with that ladder you see

POIROT
I quite sympathise Mademoiselle

POIROT walks thoughtfully about the cove examining the cliffs
Suddenly he stops and beckons to RACE

POIROT
(shouting)
Come here Colonel Look at this

RACE joins POIROT and sees what POIROT has found - a narrow
gap in the cliff face They squeeze through it

INT CAVE MIDDAY

POIROT and RACE stand in the cave It is faintly lit

RACE
Hm The airs quite fresh

POIROT sniffs delicately

POIROT

Indeed It smells of le Souffle De Mer
RACE

Whats that
POIROT

The breath of the sea

RACE
Hm Very poetic

The two men look about them examining the cave in detail
Suddenly POIROT looks at a shelf high above his head

POIROT
One might perhaps see that there is
nothing up there

108 Continued

RACE stretches up a long arm but is still too short for an

effective search by about a foot Somewhat precariously he

manages a toe-hold in the cave wall and hoisting himself up
is now able to investigate the shelf properly Suddenly he

whistles and descends abruptly In his hands is a tin box

labelled Sandwiches

RACE
Ah a picnic box

POIROT
A curious place to hide the egg and
cress sandwiches would you not say
mon vieux

RACE opens the box WE TRACK in to a CLOSE UP to see that
the various compartments labelled Salt Pepper and Mustard
are all full of what looks like salt RACE wets a finger
and tastes some

RACE
Good God Not egg and cress Poirot
Heroin So my information was
correct What a lucky break The

fellow Ive been looking for is obviously
using this place as a drop or a cache

POIROT
What a fortunate find mon cher Now all
you have to do is have a watch kept and
you will soon know who it is

RACE

Exactly It will give that idle Sergeant
of mine something to do

RACE puts the sandwich box back where he found it

You know Ive been thinking It

could be that Mrs Marshall was an addict
and came here yesterday morning to meet’
her supplier

POIROT
Non Non Non It is not possible
She had steady nerves and radiant health
But of course there is always the possibility
that she discovered this business accidentally
and was silenced Alons Let us return to
the hotel

POIROT and RACE leave the cove

109 EXT BLOOD BAY MIDDAY

POIROT and RACE emerge from the cave POIROT looks first at

the bosuns harness and then at the boat Each object draws
a shudder from him

POIROT
Alas I stand between the Scylla of
Vertigo and the Charybdis of Mal De Mer
(he shrugs massively)
It is true one does not die of Mal De Mer
whereas another journey in that infernal
machine might well induce une crise des
nerfs from which I would never recover
(to Patrick Redfern)
Would you permit me Monsieur to prevail
on Mademoiselle Brewster for your place in
her boat

PATRICK REDFERN
Please go ahead Ill use the ladder

POIROT
You are too amiable

PATRICK REDFERN gives POIROT a dazzling smile and walks away
across the beach towards the ladder He is followed by RACE
POIROT meanwhile walks apprehensively down the beach towards
the boat in the company of Miss Brewster

MISS BREWSTER
All you have to do is to hop in Monsieur
Poirot and leave everything else to me

Gingerly he complies with her suggestion As soon as he is
settled she casts off and jumps into’ the boat making it
lurch sickeningly As POIROT groans unhappily she bends to
the oars Back on the beach the sergeant conceals himself
unhappily behind a rock The CAMERA TRACKS to ECU outline
figure on the sand

MIX THROUGH TO the next scene

INT CONSERVATORY DAY

ECU model replica of Blood Bay A hand comes into shot and
places a marker with Arlena Marshalls name on it in the
middle of it We PULL BACK to see POIROT leaning over the
model RACE stands watching

POIROT
Now from my own unhappy experience I
know it takes about twenty five minutes
to row from Booty Beach to Blood Bay so
it is clear Madame Marshall arrived there
at approximately five minutes past eleven
Between then and twelve oclock she was

110 Continued
POIROT (Cont)
murdered Let us see where everybody
claims to have been during those fifty
five minutes

As he speaks each suspects name he places their marker with
the appropriate time also written on it in the relevant
Place sometimes using two markers when the person named moved
from one place to another during the period under review

POIROT
Capitaine Marshall was in his room typing
Monsieur and Madame Gardener were on Booty
Beach until eleven forty when Monsieur
Gardener returned to the hotel leaving his
wife alone Monsieur Redfern was on Booty
Beach until he left with Mademoiselle
Brewster to go for a row a little before
eleven thirty Mademoiselle Brewster
herself arrived at Booty Beach about eleven
twenty after exercising in her room

Madame Castle was at Lighthouse Ledge until
she returned for her staff meeting here at
‘the hotel at eleven thirty Madame Redfern

and Mademoiselle Marshall were here at
Cutlass Cove until twelve oclock when
Madame Redfern left to go back to the hotel
leaving Mademoiselle Linda alone Finally
Monsieur Blatt was out here sailing in a
South Westerly direction Now what does all
that tell us

RACE points to the relevant markers

RACE
That the only people with watertight alibis
are Captain Marshall with his hours typing
Mr Redfern who was either in your sight or
Miss Brewsters and Mrs Redfern and Linda
Marshall who vouch for each other

POIROT
Exactement and nearly everybody had a
motive for killing her

RACE
The exception being Mr Blatt

POIROT
And even he for an innocent man seems to
be very nervous

RACE
Poirot I must confess to you that I find
this whole case most baffling Have you
any idea who it is
«ito

Continued
POIROT
I know who it should be As I told you
before this is a very slick crime
Something tells me it is not a first attempt

RACE
Im not sure I follow you

POIROT
Come let us take the little promenade
and I will explain

MIX THROUGH to next scene
EXT BIBLE BAY DAY

POIROT and RACE walk down the promontory to the Fishermens
Chapel

POIROT
I must tell you that earlier this year
I was retained by the Trojan Insurance
Company to investigate a case of strangul-
ation which the police were satisfied was
the work of a madman or tramp and not of
the obvious suspect - the husband who ben-
efited from the Insurance Policy I read
the documents and decided it was useless
to investigate because the husband had
an obviously cast iron alibi being on a
train miles away at the time of the murder
Now suddenly I am not so sure that incredible
as it may seem I Hercule Poirot did not make
the bad mistake

He looks crestfallen
RACE

Come on Poirot You mustnt reproach
yourself We all make mistakes

POIROT
Not me

RACE
Oh really Poirot Sometimes you are
impossible

They enter the Chapel with RACE laughing and POIROT affronted

INT THE SEAMENS CHAPEL BIBLE BAY DAY

The interior of the Chapel is small and ancient carved out
of stone and crossed with rough wooden tiles A cross POIROT
watched by the still chuckling RACE stops to examine a screen
illustrating the parable of the talents made out of shells

112 Continued
POIROT
(frosty)
Ah the Parable of the Talents Im
sure you have always believed that
unto everyone that hath shall be given
but from him who hath not shall be
taken away havent you cher Colonel

RACE
Have I Poirot

POIROT
Mais Naturellement Surely you have
always known that to he who doesnt
enquire nothing shall be revealed
Par example you should enquire what
the Insurance Company case has to do-
with this one instead of laughing like
the jack hass

RACE
Im sorry Poirot I really am
Perhaps you would be good enough
to explain

POIROT is mollified by RACEs apology and he graciously
consents to explain while the CAMERA examines carvings of
skulls and gargoyles martyrs and devils in a short bizarre
montage

POIROT
Cant you see they share the same
pattern - the cold blooded plotting
the strangulation the cast iron
alibi of the husband Mon vieux I
want you to do something for me I
want you to get me photographs of all
the witnesses in that case - the husband
the hiker who found the body everybody
who was interviewed The name of the
murdered woman was Alice Corrigan
Her husbands name I think was Edward
and the crime took place near Ilkley
Yorkshire

RACE
That shouldnt be too difficult The
Police probably wont have any photo-
graphs but the local press would almost
certainly have taken some at the Inquest

POIROT
Good I would also like to have a ‘
report on the financial affairs of the
murdered woman

112 Continued

RACE
I dont think I will be able to get
you any of this information before
tomorrow evening Im afraid

POIROT
Do not distress yourself mon cher
While we wait we will amuse ourselves

RACE
Amuse ourselves

Absolument We shall have un grand
pique-nique

RACE stares at POIROT in astonishment as the chapel bell
strikes the hour

he is satisfied with the venue

POIROT

place for le dejeuner sur lherbe

I thought they were elk bones
dear

MRS GARDENER
They were Reindeer Bones and they
were charred black I remember
particularly as there wasnt a
thing to eat on them No wonder
she keeps her figure

Well In not going to worry about
my figure today Daddy Im going
to gorge myself silly

KENNETH MARSHALL

highly toxic solanaceous plant
Paralysis and death occur with quite
astounding swiftness Yes - all in

hailed by RACE who comes hurrying across the shingle towards
hin
RACE
Ah Poirot Ive been looking ail
over for you

116 Continued
POIROT
Sometimes it is necessary to repose
the mind in solitude One must not
blame the little grey cells for their
moments of misanthropy

RACE
Well did you have a good picnic

POIROT
It was most illuminating and in a
certain way quite surprising

RACE
Really In what way may one ask

POTROT
Gastronomically The Goose Pie was
merveilleuse Have you any news

RACE
Yes Whilst you have been surprising
your stomach I have been finding out
about Mrs Marshalls financial affairs
In a nutshell her bank told me that
out of the hundred thousand pounds left
to her last year she has drawn out
in cash amounts all but eight thousand
To my mind this certainly confirms

A shadowy figure climbs down the cliff ladder at Blood Bay
and crosses the stretch of sand to the concealed entrance
to the cave It finds it and slips inside

In the dim light the figure crosses to the shelf and making
use of the toe hole in the cave wall reaches up and searches
the shelf Two powerful police torches suddenly stab out of

the darkness and light up MR BLATT as he grasps the sandwich
box

POIROT
Bon soir Monsieur Blatt Have you
come here to tell us one of your so°
amusing stories

MR BLATT spins round and tumbles down from the perch into the
arms of the SERGEANT POIROT rises from a shooting stick
He is elaborately muffled against the nights chill

MR BLATT

spicy about dope running

Alright alright Its a fair cop
But how you found out beats me

If its any consolation to you it was
a bit of luck really We do get them

particularly ones who are fascinated
by pirates and smuggling

you cant hang me for it

motive for murdering Madame Marshall

MR BLATT
What

RACE
You ran your stuff in here She caught
you at it and threatened to blow the
gaff and you topped her

MR BLATT
Now look guvner you cant pin
murder on me Thats not my game I
swear I never even spoke to the lady
let alone laid a finger on her Youve
got to believe me

RACE
Believe the word of a heroin smuggler -
why should I What do you think Poirot

POIROT
I think you should hold him here until
tomorrow when all shall be revealed
Meanwhile even a Hercule Poirot becomes
fatigued so perhaps you would be so
amiable as to row me back to the hotel -
with as much stateliness as you can
command

POIROT
Mesdames Messieurs I have asked
you all to meet me here this morning
because I have discovered the identity
of the murderer of Madame Marshall

There is a further buzz of surprised conversation and
POIROT takes a small bow

POIROT
It is at the moment only a theory -
though one which I am quite sure is
the correct one However thanks
to the good offices of my dear
colleague Colonel Race I am hoping
that certain proofs will arrive
shortly which will put the matter
beyond doubt Meanwhile I shall with

POIROT (V0)
I visited the scene of the crime at
twelve noon the following day that is
to say the same time the body was
discovered I was struck at once by
one very interesting fact Madame
Marshall had been obviously lying in
the shade And yet as I learned
from the reconstruction her face
had been covered by her great big
green Chinese hat Why I asked myself
was her face shielded from a non-
existent sun There could only be
one answer - the murderer had wanted
it concealed

wanted it concealed

He looks directly at PATRICK REDFERN who stirs uneasily in his
chair

PATRICK REDFERN
Why

POIROT
1 think you know very well why
Monsieur Redfern

PATRICK REDFERN
What can you mean

POIROT
I mean that everyone here at this
hotel had the opportunity to kill
Madame Marshall except for you and
Madame Redfern She hadnt got
the opportunity because she was with
Mademoiselle Linda in Cutlass Cove
(he points to Cutlass Cove
on the model)
And you hadnt got the opportunity
since as you correctly informed me

Brewster to row round the Island

PATRICK REDFERN
Well there you are then If we are
the least suspicious of all the
people here why should I know why
the murderer had wanted to conceal
Arlenas face with the hat

POIROT
Because the singular impossibility of
‘you and your wife having done the crime
convinces me beyond doubt that you
actually did do it

PATRICK REDFERN
What Is it daft you are

POIROT
No 1 dont think so Monsieur Redfern
tt is my belief that Arlena Marshall
went to Blood Bay to meet you and
-that she did meet you and that you
killed her there as you planned to do

PATRICK REDFERN bounds to his feet

PATRICK REDFERN
Jesus You re talking through your hat

POIROT shakes his head slowly
Dyou mind telling me how I did it then

POIROT

twice mon petit assassin You did
it an the same way that you murdered
Alice Corrigan at Ilkley earlier this
yearwith the able assistance of your
wite or partner Christine who helped

Pray continue Monsieur Poirot
POIROT
Merci Vous est trop gentil Let

me say at once that the crime depended
6n the character of Madame Marshall
From the start I saw she was the
archetypal victim It wasnt she who
fatally attracted men It was men

like you who fatally attracted her -

an adventurer a man of good looks and
easy assurance who makes his living

out of women and often ends up killing
them In other words you were the most
likely suspect

PATRICK REDFERN
(hotly)
Now thats enough

CHRISTINE REDFERN

PATRICK REDFERN relaxes grinning boyishly

to get Arlena Marshall to hand you
large sums of money from time to time
for investment That was how she
lost her money wasnt it There was

If anything at all of what youre
saying were true dyou mind telling
me why on earth I should kill her
Presumably there would have been
plenty more where that came from

POIROT
Not so mon ami There was very
little left And it wasnt going to
be very long before her husband was
going to start asking awkward questions
about who had swindled her She
would have told him so you had to
kill her in order to avoid a long spell
in jail Ntest ce pas

the watch to the correct time Then
she calls Linda back telling her she
has forgotten her bathing cap Why
‘should she bother to do that you may
ask The answer is simple On top of
the Fishermans Chapel in Bible Bay
there is a bell Fifteen minutes later
it was due to strike the hour and if
Linda heard it the game would be up
True as I knew from Mr Blatts
evidence that the wind was South West
and therefore blowing away from her
but Madame Christine could take no -

girl splashing about in the sea and
wearing a bathing cap would hear
nothing

wondering why you Monsieur Redfern

her husband could have presented a
more inconvenient figure Of course
she is forced to take refuge in the
cave

CHRISTINE REDFERN takes the green Chinese hat from its hiding
place behind the rock pulls out a false red curl from inside
it and lies down on the beach above the water line She then
arranges the hat over face so that it is hidden and the

curl shows to advantage

the green Chinese hat with I suspect
a false red curl pinned underneath
the brim at the back from where your

partner had hidden it earlier in the
morning and dispose yourself in a

tanned limbs wearing a white bathing
costume and Arlenas hat Do you

imagining that you had seen the corpse

MISS BREWSTER
(to Blatt)

m sorry you turned out to be a wrong

pretty good in a row boat once youd
mastered the oars

MR BLATT

Reminds me of the one about the oarsmans
wedding and the little nipper standing
outside the church watching the happy
couple and their entourage walk out under
the line of crossed blades and shouting
to his mother ‘ere mum look at all
them oars and she belting him across
the ‘ear ‘ole and saying Them aint oars
silly thems bridesmaids

MISS BREWSTER laughs loudly Surprised MR BLATT joins in

MISS BREWSTER
I say thatis funny

She takes his manacled hands in hers and gives him a
comforting squeeze He smiles at her gratefully recognising
the first time that anyone has actually laughed at one of his
jokes

MR BLATT
God bless you

The CAMERA PANS up and ZOOMS in to the firpures of RACE
and POIROT sitting on the verandah above the sun terrace

EXT VERANDAH ABOVE THE SUN TERRACE EVENING

POIROT reclines on a chaise longue his neck swathed in
scarves He looks very sorry for himself RACE sits
solicitously near him on cane chair

RACE
And I must say again Poirot it was
a masterly piece of detection Quite
masterly

POIROT
(croaking)
And I say again cher Colonel that your
attempts to save me from the talons of
Monsieur Redfern were slower than a
paralysed tortoise It is a miracle
1 am here Une veritable miracle

RACE
Oh I dont think it was quite as
serious as all that

POIROT
Parbleu I tell you there is nothing
more serieux than the life of Hercule
Poirot

He looks down on the terrace below

EXT THE TERRACE DAY

MR and MRS GARDENER cross the terrace as usual in dispute

MRS GARDENER
Let me try and explain it to you
Odell Mrs Corrigan was killed
before the time her husband could
possibly have been there

MR GARDENER
No my dear Im afraid youve got
it wrong It merely appeared that
she was killed before the husband
could have got there Actually
like Mrs Marshall she was killed
after the time when everyone thought
she was dead

MRS GARDENER

Odell I hope youre not contradicting

me She was killed before the time
her husband could have been there

MR GARDENER
(raising his voice)

Goddammit woman yes I am contradicting

you To say she was actually killed
before the husband could have got

there is to say that you dont under-

stand anything of this whole darned

business Furthermore it is my opinion that

ait is the view of a stupid inaneempt

y headed

woman without a coherent thought in the whole

ot her toggy brain In other words
Myra you have a mind of the clarity
and consistency of Clam Chowder

MRS GARDENER is completely taken aback Never in her life

bas her spouse talked to her in this manner
capitulates and takes his arm affectionately

MRS GARDENER
Yes dear Im sorry dear Youre
quite right dear She was killed
after the time when everyone thought
she was dead

Then she softens

MR GARDENER nods his head in satisfaction They disappear

round rhe corner arm in arm

EXT THE VERANDAH ABOVE THE SUN TERRACE EVENING

POIROT and RACE sit together laughing

POIROT
Thus mon cher it is possible to say
that there is reconciliation in all
things - even murder

DAPHNE CASTLE carrying a covered dish emerges from the
hotel onto the terrace accompanied by KENNETH MARSHALL
and LINDA MARSHALL

DAPHNE CASTLE
Ill see you both at dinner my
darlings Ive just got to make sure that
poor Monsieur Poirot is looked after properly

She kisses them both and hurries up to POIROT and RACE
as the MARSHALLS wave to them and move off the other way

DAPHNE CASTLE
Monsieur Poirot I have brought you a
dish specially prepared by Andrea to
tempt an invalid - Le Crapaud En Trou

POIROT blanches

POIROT
The Toad in the Hole Ce nest pas
mangeable

She uncovers the dish

DAPHNE CASTLE
Of course it is Its a great English
favourite - spicy sausage meat-in a
light batter My God you dont
think we eat amphibians like you people
do you

POIROT indicates his battered throat
POIROT
Helas mon pauvre gorge will not allow
me to consume it Madame
DAPHNE CASTLE
Nonsense of course it will Ill cut
it up so that even a baby could swallow it

She tucks his napkin into the folds of his scarves and
starts to cut up the dish

The boat hoots in the distance

RACE
The boat is waiting so Ill leave
you to your delicious supper Poirot
But let me just add that it has been
an honour and a pleasure to work
with you again

POIROT
And for me too mon brave Colonel
Au revoir

RACE
Au revoir

He stoops holding out his hand POIROT ignores the hand
but instead embraces him on both cheeks with loud smacking
kisses RACE goes bright scarlet chokes dramatically and
takes his leave POIROT smiles broadly

DAPHNE CASTLE

I cant really think why youre looking

so pleased with yourself I told you

the Redferns did it all along
POIROTs smiling mouth drops open in astc shment and outrage
giving DAPHNE CASTLE the opportunity to ram a spoonful of
Toad in the Hole into it
