FINAL DRAFT

FADE IN
EXT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

SUPER April 27 1973

All is quiet outside this suburban school on a sunny
Friday afternoon Cars idle in the driveway awaiting
the three oclock onslaught of liberated children
Two faded yellow buses stand ready

The lull is shattered by the CLANGING of the final BELL
A swarm of children pours out the door and down the
broad front steps scattering across the lawn toward
the cars and the buses

Moving slowly through the crowd ROBIN and ALEX HAMMOND
nine-year-old identical twins appear at the doorway
Attractive dark-haired children they seem more sub-
dued than the others As they walk quietly down the
stairs Robin lags behind staring at a boy teasing a
girl nearby He is NICK MCBRIDE eleven years old

two grades ahead of Robin and the most popular boy in
school The pretty girl laughing at his antics is KIM
HAMMOND also eleven Robins older sister

ALEX
Cmon Robin

ROBIN
(STUTTERING BADLY)
W-w-wheres D-d-daddy

ALEX
Hes got a meeting at the high
school Were supposed to walk
home with Kim
(sees Robin watching
the young couple)
Shes too busy Lets go
by ourselves

ROBIN
N-n-n-no Alex Lets w-w-wait

ALEX
Why
Robin is staring at Nick Alex looks understands
Hes angry

ALEX

(CONTINUING)
Youre crazy Im not waiting

He strides away Robins eyes remain on Nick and Kim
Nick says something to Kurt She shakes her head and
pains toward Robin Robin quickly turns away as they
look at her When she glances back Kim is walking
towards her and Nick is bicycling away

KIM
Okay lets go
The sisters start to walk across the lawn

ROBIN
Y-you 1-1-like him

KIM

ROBIN

(SMILES SHYLY)
Y-you know

KIM
Nick Oh hes all right I guess
They walk on in silence with Robin stealing glances at
her big sister

ROBIN

(FINALLY)
Are y-y-you g-gonna m-in-marry him

KIM
Robin
Robin smiles and takes Kims hand They walk along the
road kicking rocks and swinging their bookbags Sud-
denly Kim halts

KIM

(CONTINUING)
Oh damn
Robin looks up in surprise

KIM

(CONTINUING)
Debbie was gonna lend me her new
record Look you go on home
by yourself Tell Mom Ill be
a little late
Before Robin can reply Kim is hurrying away Robin watches her go then moves off alone breaking
into a skip and playing imaginary hopscotch

As she turns off the main road into a side street
Robin passes a construction site The empty skeleton
of a half-finished apartment building looms up above
the dark shade trees Hearing VOICES Robin stops to
investigate

ROBIN

(CALLS OUT)
Alex
The VOICES continue Robin moves closer peering
through the tall bushes surrounding the lot She
sees Nick playing inthe framework with three of his
classmates Robin recognizes JUDE CUNNINGHAM and
KELLY LYNCH as Kims two best friends The fourth
child WENDY RICHARDS is a dark-haired girl domin-
eering and loud As Robin watches Wendy jumps
up onto the floor of the building

WENDY
I want to play Murder Whos
the killer

NICK
You Wendy
JUDE
(GIGGLING)
you Nick
KELLY
Yes Nick
WENDY
(LAUGHING)

Youll never catch me Hide your

eyes killer

As Nick turns his back hiding his eyes against an ex-
posed beam the children scatter through the structure
Robin watches with mounting excitement as Nick finishes
counting and whirls around

NICK
The killer is coming for you
He moves into the building chanting Kill kill ina

low monotone As he disappears from view Robin cau-
tiously edges out of the bushes and moves up to the
building

NICK (0S
The killer strikes

1 I
Robin hears Judes SQUEAL of LAUGHTER Nick has caught
her Immediately Judes VOICE TAKES UP the kill
chant in unison with Nick

INT APARTMENT BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY 2

Robin climbs up onto the floor and peers into the dark
gloomy structure Suddenly she hears a SHRIEK Ter-
rified she backs against a wall LAUGHTER FOLLOWS im-
mediately and Robin hears Kellys VOICE TAKING UP the
hant As the three killers move through the vast
tructure searching for Wendy KILL KILT ECHOES off
he walls and hardwood floors
bin cautiously steps out of the doorway into the im-
nse unfinished lobby Ominous shadows slash across

e floor as the excited girl listens to the relentless
ANTING of the children
bin pushes on a makeshift wooden door It slips off
ts temporary hinges crashing down to the floor The
OISE is like a rifle shot suddenly there is ABSOLUTE
LENCE in the structure
Petrified Robin crouches behind a wall waiting The
CHANTING quickly RESUMES and she breathes a long sigh
of relief
Robin moves through a dark corridor hugging the walls
Flushed with excitement she imagines herself a killer
searching for Wendy As she moves past an empty room
she hears a SOFT GIGGLE Robin stops and listens care-
fully Once again she hears the GIGGLE LOUDER this
time coming from nearby

Stepping to a doorway she leans around the corner and
peers inside In the darkness she can see nothing
Gathering her courage she quietly slips into the room
The room appears empty but a closet door is slightly
ajar As Robin approaches she hears a FAINT GASP from
behind her Whirling around she sees Wendy crouched
behind a cardboard box in the corner

(omme)

oo)

ie)

NZe-PEWDaACBwWtHA

WENDY

(HISSING)
You better not tell
Before Robin can react she hears a THUD from above
Looking up she sees Nicks head appear through an
opening in the ceiling Seeing Robin then Wendy
standing in the corner he howls in triumph

NICK

(CALLING OUT)
Here killers here
Nicks head disappears from the opening and Robin hears
the POUNDING of RUNNING FEET

WENDY

(MALICIOUSLY)
Now youve done it you idiot
The CHANTING GROWS LOUDER as the killers rush towards
the room Trapped Wendy looks frantically for an es-
cape but finds nothing Turning around suddenly she
grins at Robin a cruel hard expression on her face

WENDY

(CONTINUING SLOWLY)
Kill kill kill
Picking up the chant Wendy begins to advance on Robin
Terrified Robin turns and rushes out of the room
bowling over Nick in the doorway Delighted that the
game is continuing with a new victim he follows Wendy
in pursuit of Robin
Robin flees down the long dark corridor KILL KILL
ECHOING in her wake As she rounds a corner Jude ap-
pears looming up in front of her Robin screams and
sprints in the opposite direction Kelly leaps out of

a doorway and grabs for her but Robin swinging out
blindly escapes the killer

INT STORAGE ROOM - DAY 3

Darting into the large room Robin collapses against a
wall gasping for breath As her eyes adjusts to the
darkness she spies a rickety ladder extending through
a hole in the floor to the basement below Stacked up-
right near the opening are several sheets of window
glass Before Robin can make a move towards the lad-
der she hears a horrible SCREECH and Wendy appears in
the doorway a vicious look on her face

WENDY
Killers here
Wendy advances Terrified Robin begins to back away

ROBIN
N-n-n-no

Nick Jude and Kelly appear in the doorway chanting
Kill kill Moving quickly Robin grabs the ladder
and starts down into the basement careful not to knock
over the sheets of glass stacked near the opening
Peering into the pitch-black basement Robin hesitates
But as Wendy and her fellow killers close in on her
Robin continues down the ladder Wendy rushes up and
grabs the ladder

ROBIN

(CONTINUING)
P-p-please
Wendy grins and shakes the ladder The chanting is
deafening Robin hugs the wooden slats Wendy shakes
even harder Robin screams Nick moves around Wendy
to get a better look He accidentally bumps the glass
stacked next to the opening The sudden movement is
just enough to dislodge a razor-sharp pane of glass and
send it hurtling down directly at Robin

The girls last scream catches in her throat as the
glass slices through her neck She is instantly
decapitated

Horrified Wendy watches the glass and the body crash
to the concrete basement floor Kelly screams Jude
sobs loudly Nick can only stare in shock Finally

he manages to speak

NICK

(WHISPERING HOARSELY)
We gotta get somebody quick
Nick starts to go Wendy instantly whirls grabs his
arm

WENDY
Are you crazy Theyll put us in
jail
Confused Nick cannot reply The other girls grow
silent

WENDY
(CONTINUING)
If we tell anyone theyll say
its our fault Whod believe it
was an accident
Nick starts to protest
WENDY
(CONTINUING

INTERRUPTING)
Listen to me

(MORE )

WENDY (C ONT D )

Well go home now and never ever

tell anyone Theyll think it was

an accident 110 one but us will

ever know

She looks at each of them They are still too numb to
respond

WENDY

(CONTINUING)
Everybody swear never to tell
Wendy glares at Jude

WENDY
(CONTINUING)
Jude
JUDE
(SOFTLY)
I swear
WENDY
Kelly

Kelly looks from Wendy to the mangled body and begins
to whimper

WENDY

(CONTINUING STERNLY)
Kelly
The frightened girl looks up at Wendy

KELLY

(WHISPERS)
I dont wanta go to jail

WENDY
Swear

KELLY
I swear
Wendy turns to Nick At first he appears defiant ready
to object but he wilts under her withering gaze

NICK
(FINALLY)
I wont tell

WENDY

SLOWLY NODS)
Good

With a final glance down at Robins mutiliated body
Wendy quickly ushers her shocked friends out of the
room
As their FOOTSTEPS ECHO away across the hardwood floor
there is a terrible silence Then starting very
quietly more FOOTSTEPS are HEARD this time a single
person approaching the ladder from above The FOOT-
STEPS STOP and a deep black shadow falls across the
ladder HEAVY BREATHING punctuates the oppressive
quiet growing louder and more anguished

Cut TO
INT STORAGE ROOM - DUSK

We slowly TILT UP TO the tortured features of RAYMOND
HAMMOND Robins father A handsome dark-haired man
in his late thirties he teaches history at George
Winston High School

Wracked with grief he stands near the opening in the
floor and watches as two Paramedics bring up the body
of his daughter from the dark basement

A young Policeman standing nearby raises the white
sheet covering Robins remains Hammond steps up

and gazes at his daughters decapitated body A

look of absolute horror and revulsion freezes

on his face what he sees he will never forget
Paralyzed Hammond barely hears the CAR PULLING UP

in front of the construction site He turns and

looks out the window

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DUSK 5
A Police Officer is getting out of his car Walking
around to the passenger side he opens the door

for an attractive blonde woman in her mid-thirties
VIVIAN HANMOND Robins mother appears pale and
haggard as she steps out of the car Kim and Alex
slowly climb out of the back With the Police Officer
escorting her Vivian and her children move toward

the skeleton of a building

Catching sight of her husband framed in a lower window
Vivian suddenly breaks away from the Police Officer and
runs inside the building

INT STORAGE ROOM - DUSK

Hammond moves quickly to the door grabbing his
hysterical wife as she bursts into the room

HAMMIOND
No

VIVIAN

(SOBBING WILDLY)
Where is she Where is Robin
Seeing the covered figure lying on a stretcher Vivian
moans in anguish
Struggling furiously she strains to break her hus-
bands hold but he is too powerful They are both
in tears shaking with grief when Kim and Alex step
into the doorway

KIM

WHISPERING)
Daddy

HAMMOND
(angrily

TO VIVIAN)

Why did you bring them here

Vivian collapses burying her head in his shoulder
and sobbing furiously but Hammond pushes her out of
the room
(CONTINUING)
Kim Alex Stay out in the
hallway
Kim stumbles out into the corridor and begins to
cry softly Alex takes his mothers hand and tries
comfort her
The Paramedics pick up the stretcher and maneuver it
out of the room As they pass through the doorway into
the corridor a corner of the sheet slips off Robins
corpse Before a Paramedic can replace it the de-
capitated torso is briefly glimpsed by the family
Alex is shocked Kim doesnt appear to realize what
she sees But Vivians horror wells up in her
throat bursting out in a deranged scream

Cut TO

INT BEDROOM - DAY

Another SCREAM as throbbing DISCO MUSIC pulsates from
a large portable RADIO sitting on a dresser

figure is slipping into a pair of tight jeans Pull-
ing on a halter top she sways to the MUSIC

innocent quality

KIM

(CALLS OUT)
Okay Mom
Kim quickly finishes dressing whirling around the room
to the pounding disco rhythm Giving her hair a few
final strokes with a brush she gazes at a photograph
of a young man stuck in her mirror On the picture

is written To Kim the best on the floor dancing
that is Love Nick

Kim glances at another photograph stuck in her mirror
This one shows her sister Robin taken a few days be-
fore the accident Her sadness passes as quickly as it
came Gathering her textbooks she switches OFF the
RADIO and exits

fast The years have favored him except for a touch
of gray around the temples and a few extra pounds he
looks much the same way as we remember him Vivian
however wears the strain of the past seven years

in her gaunt drawn features and high-strung manner
Thumbing through his morning newspaper Hammond steals
quick glances at his wife She does not look up at
him but stares at the table toying with her spoon

snaps her purse shut Hammond says nothing

Just as the elevator doors slide open the Cleaning Wo-

First period biology class features MONTY WELLER a
tall thin Englishman in his late thirties This stuf-
fy dour science teacher drones on about the joys of ex-
ploring frog vertebrae while most of his class naps
daydreams or passes notes

Seated in the back near the door Jude is furtively
opening a handwritten note She quickly reads it
Stifling a giggle she looks up to see Kim and Vicki
across the aisle eagerly awaiting her reply Jude
tears out part of a page from her biology book and
scrawls her answer Folding the note she taps the boy
next to her and motions for him to pass it on

Vicki grabs the note from the boy Quickly scanning

it she nods impressed Kim reads it and mouths the
word Wow to Jude who blushes happily

Glancing out into the hallway Jude notices Slick walk-
ing past Seeing her in class he stops and waves

Jude frantically tries to motion him away Their backs
to the door Kim and Vicki watch with curiosity as Jude
gestures in their direction Seeing her friends
watching her Jude smiles and tries to ignore Slick
Not to be denied he exaggeratedly mimes Weller nose
to his textbook lecturing on oblivious to his class
Jude laughs in spite of herself Kim and Vicki turn
around

Glancing out the door the two girls stare in disbelief
at the small weird curly-haired boy doing a perfect im-
itation of the eminently boring Weller Their surprise
turns to hilarity as they realize this boy must be
Judes prom date Kim holds up the note raising her
eyebrows as she gestures toward Slick Jude nods Kim
and Vicki can barely contain their laughter They do
not notice Mr Weller eyeing them suspiciously as he
rattles on about frog intestines Slick mouths the
words See you at lunch in the van Jude nods and
smiles

With a final bow and a wave he exits

Kim suddenly looks up to find a red-faced Mr Weller
looming above her

her hand

before Lous gang can pry him loose

Two of the gang pin Alex against the counter Wiping
blood from his mouth Lou grins maliciously and slugs
Alex in the stomach The boy groans and doubles over
Lou grabs Alexs hair and slams his head back against
the glass shield of the counter

As Lou rears back to throw another punch his two
friends suddenly release Alex and scatter The boy
crumples to the floor Lou turns around to see two

103 103
As she gently tracks the perf me across her skin she
is startled by another reflection in her mirror
Whirling around she sees Alex Standing up she pir-
ouettes and curtsies before her brother

KIM
Well
Alex gapes stunned by his sisters appearance

ALEX

(FINALLY)
Amazing

KIM

(SMILES)

ALEX

KIM
(LAUGHS)

She picks up her corsage from her dressing table

KIM

(CONTINUING)
You want to help or just leer

ALEX

KIM
(LAUGHS)

late

Alex takes the corsage As he attaches the bright red
flower on her gown she playfully dabs perfume on his
neck He pulls back pricking himself on the pin

ALEX

KIM

The DOORBELL RINGS

KIM

(CONTINUING)

103 103

ALE
ers face is revealed It is the nine-year-old Alex
Kim cradles the killer on the ground She turns his
head toward the light We SEE his face full-on

VIVIA N
Robin
She rushes forward lunging for the body Hammond
grabs her restraining her
Alexs dark eyes stare back unseeing at his family
His resemblance to his dead twin sister is uncanny
His hair falls onto his forehead in bangs as Robins
had done seven years before His makeup has been slop-
pily applied The rouged cheeks and the smudged red
lips amplify the grotesque impersonation
Kim strokes her brothers hair Hammond presses his
hysterical wife to him The onlookers slowly close in
We SLOWLY DISSOLVE FROM Alexs face TO a photograph of
the Hammond family taken seven years earlier We MOVE
IN CLOSE ON the twins Alex and Robin are smiling

FADE OUT

THE END
