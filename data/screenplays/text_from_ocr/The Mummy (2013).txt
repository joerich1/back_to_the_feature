FADE IN
EXT PERSIAN GULF - NIGHT

An OFFSHORE OIL REFINERY belches flame like some hellish
fortress Hulking TANKERS lie at anchor under a full moon

SUPER PERSIAN GULF

We descend along the steel-clad legs of the refinery - and
PLUNGE INTO THE SEA

UNDERWATER - NIGHT

A strange undersea world of anchor chains pilings and pipes
lit by firelight and moonlight

A compact SUBMARINE cruises into view hugging the sea floor
INT SUBMARINE (IN MOTION)

A stripped-down vessel purpose-built for this mission A
squad of EIGHT NAVY SEALs sits inside They wear DRY SUITS -
bulky scuba gear - and hold dive helmets in their laps

TYLER COLT 35 looks them over A natural—-born soldier the
more dangerous the situation is the cooler he gets Right
now he’s completely at ease His calm steadies the men

A SEAL named VAIL pilots the sub The other SEALs ride behind
Tyler HACKETT CARVER BARROWS WEISS MUNROE GOMEZ

The electric sub is nearly silent Exterior sounds echo
through the hull RUMBLING MOTORS Metallic BOOMS and GROANS
The SEALS exchange looks at the hellish noises

BARROWS
Oh yeah this is safer than a
helicopter

TYLER
Special Warfare’s been dying to try
this But nobody’s saying it’s safe

CARVER
So why’d you volunteer

Tyler flashes a cowboy grin

TYLER
Because it’s never been done

MUNROE
Go big or go home right

An UNDERSEA OIL PIPELINE looms out of the dark
TYLER
No going home now Suit up

The SEALS pull on their dive helmets
EXT UNDERWATER - OIL PIPELINE - NIGHT

The 48-inch pipe runs level across the uneven sea floor The
sub noses UNDERNEATH the pipeline where it crosses a ravine

A DOCKING PORT on top of the submarine MATES WITH THE PIPE
INT SUBMARINE

With a splatter of water Tyler opens a topside hatch -
revealing THE BOTTOM OF THE OIL PIPELINE He plants a
specialized gun against the pipe and FIRES A PRESSURE GAUGE
punches through the metal

TYLER
Pressure gauge in Flood it

Vail pulls a lever The SUBMARINE FLOODS to the top leaving
the SEALs underwater inside Pumps bring the pressure up

TYLER (CONTD)
Pressure match

He moves aside Hackett fires up an UNDERWATER CUTTING TORCH
Cuts a large circular section out of the bottom of the pipe

In the hole in the pipe a rippling surface the OIL-WATER
INTERFACE Oil flowing over the heavier water in the sub

HACKETT
Look at that

Tyler reaches up into the oil His glove comes back stained
black - dark beads of oil floating up Surreal

TYLER
Here we go

He slings a DRY BAG over his shoulder Picks up a DIVER
PROPULSION VEHICLE (DPV) and thrusts it up into the pipe

TYLER SWIMS UP INTO THE OIL AND DISAPPEARS
INT PIPELINE

There are lights on Tyler’s DPV and helmet but the crude oil
is nearly opaque and they create only a dull brown glow

He switches on his SONAR UNIT

His faceplate LIGHTS UP with a HEADS-UP-DISPLAY He can see
his hands and the DPV in front of him the curving walls of
the pipe All painted in swarming RED DOTS OF LIGHT

TYLER
SONAR works Come on in boys

INT SUBMARINE
The other SEALS dive up into the oil
INT PIPELINE

Tyler activates his DPV Impellers WHIR He zooms up the
pipeline dragging his dry bag The other SEALs behind him

EXT PIPELINE TRACKING SHOT

Underwater we rush across the sea floor following the
pipeline into the shallows and up onto a moonlit beach We
fly over desolate dunes tracking the pipeline it runs
straight as an arrow into the desert interior of Iraq

INT OPERATIONS CENTER
A hyper-modern command center Windowless and hushed
SUPER LANGLEY AIR FORCE BASE VIRGINIA

An Air Force Intelligence Officer MCCALL sits at a bank of
monitors tracking the SEALs in the pipeline Others stand
watching a CIA OFFICIAL an AIR FORCE COLONEL a NAVY
COMMANDER and a SENATOR

AIR FORCE COLONEL
Satellites spotted radiation It’s
faint - but consistent with a
breeder reactor refining uranium

SENATOR
Inside Iraq

The CIA official pulls up a ghostly image of an underground
complex - like an X-ray of the Earth itself

CIA OFFICIAL
Ground-penetrating radar shows a
bunker This was taken yesterday

Satellite images of trucks and armed men around the bunker

CIA OFFICIAL (CONTD)

EXT IRAQI DESERT - PIPELINE - NIGHT

A HATCH COVER unscrews and OPENS Tyler climbs out into the
moonlight - a GLEAMING PITCH-BLACK FIGURE COVERED IN OIL He
drags his dry-bag out behind him The other SEALs follow

They strip off their dry suits revealing FATIGUES and BODY
ARMOR The SEALS laugh quietly in the darkness Holy shit we
did that They open dry bags and pull out weapons

Tyler puts on his helmet Swings NIGHT-VISION GOGGLES into
place The four-barreled headset gives him an alien look

TYLER
Let’s move

EXT DESERT TERRAIN - NIGHT

Tyler leads the SEALS across the sand at a dogtrot running
without lights They pass a kudurru - an ancient Assyrian
boundary stone carved with images of demons and death
Focused on worldly dangers Tyler doesn’t break stride

EXT IRAQI DESERT - BUNKER

The SEALs crouch on a rise overlooking the site The BUNKER’S
ENTRANCE is a low concrete bulkhead set into a rocky slope
Two military FLATBED TRUCKS sit outside

TYLER
Command Crossbow Eyes on target
No visible hostiles
(to the team)
Dosimeters on Watch your exposure

They switch on the battlefield dosimeters on their shoulders
Tyler signals The SEALS advance in two fire teams

Tyler sweeps a truck with his team Nobody there He frowns
at the objects in the truck bed crowbars hammers picks and
shovels Not exactly the weapons of jihad

They converge on the bunker
IT’S NOT A BUNKER What looked like concrete turns out to be

quarried stone THIS IS A TOMB Ancient walls carved with
cuneiform writing and bas-relief figures
The SEALS stack up on each side of the entrance On the
ground at their feet a JACKHAMMER The tomb door is freshly
BLASTED OPEN - the stone slab toppled inward Tyler frowns

TYLER (CONTD)
(quietly into radio)
Command Bunker doesn’t check out
This is not a modern structure
Radiation levels zero repeat zero

They hold a moment waiting

MCCALL (VO)
Crossbow Mission is go Repeat go

Tyler nods Eases around the corner Clear They go in
INT TOMB - PASSAGEWAY

Tyler leads the squad silent as ghosts All of them at high
alert Their goggles gleam like cats’ eyes in the dark

He sees in eerie green monochrome INFRARED FLASHLIGHTS and
LASER SCOPES illuminate the scene in sharp detail Their
rifles sweeping as they search for enemies in the darkness

ANCIENT CARVINGS on the walls scenes of war and horror
Assyrian soldiers slaughtering enemies Torturing prisoners

A BURST OF STATIC in Tyler’s goggles obscures his vision He
slaps the headset it clears He keeps moving

ANTECHAMBER

The SEALS advance into a stone room There are DEAD MEN ON
THE FLOOR Seven of them Tyler signals a few men to guard
the approaches while others check the bodies The dead men
are DESERT TRIBESMEN They clutch guns picks sledgehammers

TYLER
These guys aren’t terrorists
They’re tomb robbers

GOMEZ
I think they killed each other

AN ECHOING WHISPER in the chamber A strange language Tyler
looks up in alarm A BURST OF STATIC in his night-vision
scopes The WHISPER echoes again Multiplying

CARVER
You hearing that

The other SEALS look around spooked They’re hearing it
sourceless voices on the edge of perception
TYLER
Remember who you are Stay tight
Watch your flanks

INT MISSION CONTROL ROOM

STATIC obliterates Tyler’s voice on the speakers McCall
pulls on headphones and frowns listening

MCCALL
Crosstalk on the channel

We hear what he hears A GUTTURAL CHANT partly masked by
static A language not heard in twenty-five centuries

INT TOMB - LABYRINTH
The passage opens up into a LABYRINTH Tyler signals a hold

TYLER
Fire Team B hold here Team A
forward on me

He trails off Vail and Weiss are trembling Drenched in
sweat Chanting the SAME INCANTATION that echoes around them
As Tyler watches a third SEAL Munroe starts chanting too

TYLER (CONTD)
Hey Munroe

He flips up Munroe’s night-vision goggles Munroe’s face is
slick with sweat Eyes rolled back Deep in a trance In
unison the spellbound SEALS RAISE THEIR GUNS AND START
SHOOTING Chaos Screams and shots in the dark

Tyler ducks Carver drops to the floor beside him - hit

TYLER (CONT’D)
Carver

He drags Carver around a corner Kneels over him CARVER IS
DEAD A bullethole in his forehead Empty eyes staring

TYLER (CONTD)
Hold your fire Stand down

He looks into the dark Muzzle flashes Chaotic movement
Behind him CARVER GETS UP Tyler turns astonished

TYLER (CONT’D)
Carver

In Tyler’s night-vision CARVER’S EYES SHINE with an unholy
light GLOWING VAPOR rolls from his mouth like smoke He’s
clearly dead - but it’s not keeping him down
Carver grabs Tyler HURLS HIM twenty feet into a wall Tyler
hits hard and drops Carver pulls a knife and comes for him

Cornered Tyler opens fire Dead Carver absorbs multiple hits
without slowing down Goes for him with the blade Tyler
catches the descending knife Strains with both hands against
the undead soldier’s terrible strength

There’s a GRENADE hanging on Carver’s vest TYLER PULLS THE
PIN Drives Carver back with both feet and runs for his life

BOOM The explosion engulfs Carver and knocks Tyler flying
Carvers body burns like a torch Supernaturally flammable

INT MISSION CONTROL ROOM
The officials listen to the chaos in consternation

CIA OFFICIAL
McCall What’s happening McCall

McCall sits trembling in his headphones Sweat dripping down
his face He mutters under his breath in a dead language

INT TOMB - LABYRINTH

Tyler fights a retreating battle through the maze - firing at
two UNDEAD SEALs who pursue him relentlessly

TYLER
Fall back To the entrance

INT MISSION CONTROL ROOM

Shouts and gunfire echo tinnily in the control room The
officials approach McCall baffled by his immobility One of

the Airmen on the security detail shakes McCall’s shoulder

McCall surges to his feet PULLS THE AIRMAN’S GUN Faces
them eyes rolled back The other Airmen pull their own guns

INT TOMB - LABYRINTH - TUNNEL

BLAM BLAM Tyler backs out of a tunnel firing his pistol

A STORM OF STATIC in his goggles blinds him He rips off his
helmet Utter darkness An eerie hush Tyler clips a tactical

light to his pistol sweeps the beam through the dark

A WHOOSH OF FLAME The passageway fills with firelight Tyler
spins in amazement to see

THE SARCOPHAGUS CHAMBER

The heart of the tomb Walls carved with old gods figures
with the heads of hawks or lions PILLARS OF FIRE in two
BRAZIERS On a stone dais lies a SARCOPHAGUS of black iron
The sarcophagus is covered with gold engraving - cuneiform
writing and mystical symbols shining against the black iron
Egyptian symbols The ANKH The EYE OF HORUS

Six iron CLASPS seal the coffin shut

Tyler approaches the sarcophagus The pillar of fire behind
him takes the form of a HUMAN FACE CRUEL AND CUNNING It
watches him Tyler shivers sweat gleaming on his brow

A SUDDEN VISION

Tyler sees himself laying his hand on the sarcophagus

Like a sleepwalker Tyler steps forward Printed in the iron
an ancient hand-shape called the HAMSA An eye in the palm
He lays his hand in the imprint Perfect fit

BANG Tyler snatches his hand back with a cry

A barbed bronze SPIKE juts from the Hamsa hand It withdraws
like clockwork TYLER’S BLOOD drains into the sarcophagus

Tyler looks at his hand a star-shaped wound in his palm

The pillars of flame LEAP HIGHER The face in the fire SMILES
WICKEDLY The whispers in the tomb multiply
A VISION
Tyler sees himself turning clasps Opening the sarcophagus

Tyler shakes the vision off trembling He steps close to the
sarcophagus Reaches for an iron clasp with his right hand

TYLER
No

With his left hand he pulls his right hand back DIGS HIS
THUMB INTO HIS WOUNDED PALM He SCREAMS It clears his head
Tyler turns and runs

Behind him the face in the fire ROARS IN SILENT RAGE
TRACKING SHOT

We track Tyler as he runs - BURNING FLARE in his hand A
RUMBLE The WHOLE TOMB SHUDDERS Dust falls

An UNDEAD TOMB ROBBER lurches out of the dark with a pickaxe
Tyler jumps off the wall Sails OVER THE TOMB-ROBBER’S HEAD
The dead robber spins to face him He stabs it with his
flare it IGNITES BURNING WITH UNNATURAL HEAT and FALLS
Tyler runs THE WALLS BUCKLE AND CRACK
EXT TOMB - NIGHT
Tyler dives out as the tomb entrance collapses behind him
A CLOUD OF DUST billows over him The dust TAKES THE SHAPE OF
A CLAWING HAND as if to drag him back underground But the
dust blows away
Tyler lies gasping under the stars The sole survivor

FADE TO BLACK
SUPER TWO YEARS LATER
EXT TRUCK STOP - DAY

A major outpost for long-haul truckers A BIG RIG pulls in
and stops at the diesel pumps

Tyler gets out He’s wearing a dirty denim jacket Shaggy
hair Ten-day stubble Gone is the cocky can-do attitude of
the Navy SEAL He looks hunted and wary a stray dog

INT TRUCK STOP DINER - DAY
Tyler sits hunched at the counter over steak and eggs He rubs

at the palm of his right hand the STAR-SHAPED SCAR left by
the sarcophagus He’s having trouble keeping his eyes open

TYLER
Can I get some more coffee

The kindly old WAITER behind the counter obliges him

WAITER
Long piece of road

TYLER
It never ends

He props his head on his hand haunted staring into the cup
The coffee swirls hypnotically darkening black as ink

EXT ASSYRIAN BATTLEFIELD - DAY

A walled city burns Siege towers toppled against its walls
Armies have been broken here Frenzied horses drag shattered
chariots Fallen warriors and weapons litter the ground

We move through this hell in a POV shot staggering erratic
We look down - and see a POWERFULLY MUSCLED BODY ornamented
with gold - and PIERCED WITH MANY BLACK ARROWS

INT PALACE - NIGHT

POV shot we lie on a bed as women pull ARROWS from our
wounds So many In the distance shouting multitudes

INT TEMPLE - NIGHT

POV we lie on a slab of stone Around us EGYPTIAN PRIESTS -
bald and robed in linen - wrap us in black tarred bandages
We look to the side the IRON SARCOPHAGUS lies waiting

We look up a priest uses a POLISHED COPPER POT to pour
smoking hot bitumen down on our body The pot drifts upward
When it is directly overhead we see a REFLECTION our face

It‘s the face of ASHURBANIPAL King of Assyria Battle-
scarred and cruel Taut with agony and resolve This is the
face we saw in the fire down in the tomb

The kettle tips Hot tar pours down A HOWL OF AGONY

INT TRUCK STOP DINER - DAY

Tyler EXPLODES OUT OF HIS NIGHTMARE lurching off his stool
with a shout OVERTURNS A TABLE A crash of crockery

Four TRUCKERS surge to their feet around the toppled table
splattered with eggs and scalding coffee Furious

TRUCKER 1
You damned tweaker

He grabs a fistful of Tyler’s jacket Tyler raises his hands
still getting his bearings

TYLER
Sorry I just

TRUCKER 1
You just crossed the line

He THROWS A PUNCH Tyler slaps it aside

TYLER
Easy I’1l pay for it

His lack of fear enrages them

TRUCKER 2
Damn right you will

They all come for him at once Tyler takes them apart They
grab at him he catches them in wristlocks They swing he
blocks hard and counter-punches like a wrecking ball

The first trucker goes down the next one snaps open a
FOLDING KNIFE Tyler takes it away Throws it across the room
- burying the point in the WE AIM TO PLEASE sign

Behind the counter the waiter stands frozen with a phone to
his ear staring at the action in disbelief

VOICE ON PHONE (VO)
Nine-one-one Whats your emergency

SOUNDS OF MAYHEM as the waiter stares Another knife whizzes
over his head and plants itself in the sign

In the middle of the room Tyler flips the last trucker high
over his head and slams him down Four truckers out cold

A hush Tyler looks around sheepishly at the stunned room

TYLER
Sorry

EXT TRUCK STOP - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Tyler walks across the parking lot inspecting his knuckles
He opens the door of his truck As he swings up into the cab -
a POLICE CAR behind him SQUAWKS ITS SIREN Tyler sighs

INT SHERIFF’S OFFICE - DAY

Tyler sits beside the Sheriffs desk handcuffed

SHERIFF

say you weren’t the bad guy We’re
dropping the assault charges

TYLER
Thank you sir

SHERIFF
But then there’s this matter

He hoists a heavy duffel bag off the floor Starts pulling
weapons out of it Pistols Sawed-off shotgun A bowie knife

SHERIFF (CONTD)
Got permits for these

TYLER
Got a warrant to search my truck

The Sheriff shakes his head sourly Taps at his computer

EXT AEGEAN SEA - DAY

We race over pale blue seas Ahead a craggy Greek isle It
has an ancient name but these days it’s known simply as

LORENZO’S ISLAND

A quaint fishing fleet bobs at the docks - beside a GLEAMING
WHITE MEGA-YACHT the LIBERTINE at its own pier Above the
harbor a VILLAGE rises steeply - a maze of blocky whitewashed
houses Crowning the island LORENZO’S CASTLE

INT LORENZO’S CASTLE - GREAT HALL - DAY
A grand room adorned with fine antiquities and paintings

A STUNNING WOMAN IN A PRADA SKIRT SUIT strides in heels
clicking on marble She carries a black leather valise

This is JENNY HALSEY 30 A brilliant archaeologist whose
passion for her studies overrides every other impulse -
including fear and rational self-preservation

A uniformed butler TOMAS extends a guiding hand

TOMAS
In the library Doctor Halsey

Shelves of rare books Statues and relics A private museum

Here waits LORENZO MONTANARI 55 a billionaire of shady
origins who fancies himself a great man He greets Jenny with
the covetous eyes of a collector of beautiful things

LORENZO
Jenny Halsey It’s been too long

JENNY
Lorenzo What have you got for me

LORENZO
Come and see

He guides her across the library On a table arranged on a
soft cloth are the FRAGMENTS OF A STONE TABLET

Jenny inspects them fascinated this is what she loves She
pulls on white gloves Gently turns the pieces A jigsaw
puzzle of cuneiform writing and bas-relief figures

JENNY
It’s authentic Babylonian

She takes a leather case out of her valise Lays out tools
brushes blades and picks Vials of solvent and epoxy

JENNY (CONTD)
Where’d it come from

LORENZO
I can’t say My sources are not
law-abiding people

JENNY
I mean where was it found

LORENZO
In the ruins of Uruk A palace

JENNY
What about context How deep was
it What was found with it

Lorenzo shrugs eloquently Who knows such things She sighs

JENNY (CONTD)
So much is lost

She puts a headlamp on Bends over the table to examine a
fragment Lorenzo’s attention turns to Jenny’s shapely back

LORENZO
Archaeology Beautiful science

He lays a hand on her hip Jenny spins to face him shining
her headlamp in his eyes He dodges The beam follows him

JENNY
Run along and let me work

Lorenzo withdraws with a mocking bow His footsteps fade

Jenny pulls a CLOTH BUNDLE from her valise Selects tools
from her kit Listens to be sure Lorenzo has gone

She hurries across the library Kneels by a cabinet and
expertly jimmies the lock From a chest inside she takes a
GOLDEN AMULET - a mystic eye with sun-god rays

She unwraps her bundle revealing a PERFECT REPLICA of the
amulet She switches the real amulet with the fake Returns
to the table and stashes the real amulet in her valise

HOURS LATER

The tablet lies intact fractures barely visible The image
a STATUESQUE WOMAN surrounded by DEMONS Jenny is scribbling
in a SKETCHBOOK a drawing of the tablet with translations

and notes Her pencilwork is exquisite

Lorenzo looks over the tablet and grunts in approval

JENNY

The goddess Ishtar descending to the
Underworld These are her words “If
you will not open the gate I will
shatter the lock and break the door
I will bring up the dead to eat the
living And the dead will outnumber
the living under the sun” It’s one
of the oldest stories in the world

Lorenzo nods - gazing at the tablet and standing very close

LORENZO
Do you know how Ishtar reached the
Underworld Descending she came to
seven gates At each gate she had to
give something from the upper world
(MORE)

LORENZO (CONTD)
She gave up her ring her necklace
her sandalsher dress And naked
she came before the throne of hell

JENNY
I know the story

Lorenzo brushes hair from her cheek

LORENZO
Have dinner with me There’s a place
in Monaco where angels come down
from heaven to taste the oysters

JENNY

I’ve been gone too long already
LORENZO

off she realizes she’s still in makeup She yanks a bandana
from her pocket Rubs off lipstick and mascara

Professor Sheppard comes to meet her frowning

what happened I’ve been through
two courts martial a congressional
inquiry an “observation period” in
a psych ward and an involuntary
discharge I’m done with lawyers
Done with shrinks Done explaining

warfare Neuroweapons Psy ops
I specialize in a class of weapons
we call “energetic artifacts”
Objects with strange properties
Power to affect the body or mind

TYLER
The Pentagon’s got a black magic
division

Forster scowls at that language He lays a tablet computer on
the table Pulls up satellite images radiation scans

FORSTER
This is the “bunker” you raided

TYLER
It wasn’t a bunker It was a tomb

FORSTER
I know And as far back as our
satellite data goes it’s been dark
The radiation signature you were
chasing came out of nowhere the day
the robbers broke into the tomb
Twenty-four hours later it spiked
again when you went in Then it just
faded away The energy source was
reacting to intruders Uranium
doesn’t do that There’s an artifact
in there

Tyler looks at him warily mystified
TYLER
Okay

FORSTER
The Special Weapons Group has begun

to collect and study such artifacts

I have an Aztec scepter than can
strike a man blind without touching
him An Old German ring that lets a
Man pass unnoticed through crowds
Things with real warfighting

His harrowed look gives the lie to his words He turns away
EXT MOUNTAIN HIGHWAY - DAY

Steep mountain slopes shaggy with redwoods Tyler’s BIG RIG
thunders down the road He’s making up time He’s fighting
fatigue Swigging coffee Window open MUSIC pounding

He rounds a curve - and stares along the guard rail a RAVEN
PERCHES ON EVERY FENCEPOST all along the highway

He PULLS HIS HAND OFF THE WHEEL suddenly as if burned From
the wound in his palm BLACK TENDRILS spread up his arm

TYLER
No

The dark tendrils reach up his neck spiderwebbing his face
as he screams - covering his eyes

EXT UNDERWORLD - VALLEY OF THE BLIND

On a desolate plain stands a BLACK TOWER - a red BEACON
shining at its summit

Around the tower stand THOUSANDS OF PALE FIGURES Hairless
clad in rags THEY BREATHE IN UNISON Their faces have smooth
hollows where eyes should be They are THE BLIND

They stare at the black tower with sightless eyes

The DEAD KING Ashurbanipal walks among them This is how he
looks in the Underworld muscular and strong wearing a
loincloth His scalp and face clean-shaven His skin scrawled
everywhere with ARCANE SYMBOLS to ward away danger

He’s trying to reach the black tower - and he’s terrified
Moving with exquisite care to make no sound Averting his
eyes from the faces of the Blind

At the slightest noise their faces turn minutely blind eyes
seeking before returning their gaze to the beacon

A hellish INSECT lands on the Dead King’s back It bites
deep A CRY OF AGONY escapes him before he can stifle it

Around him the rhythmic breathing stops As one the Blind
turn toward him He spins away - but they’re all facing him
now He looks one in the face

DEAD KING
(in Akkadian)
No No

The faces of the Blind tear open into GAPING DEMONIC MOUTHS
They come for him pale hands reaching

INT BIG RIG - DAY

Tyler SLAMS AWAKE behind the wheel - DOING 80 MPH INTO
ONCOMING TRAFFIC Another big rig coming straight at him He
swerves JUST MISSING the other truck -

The road takes a TIGHT LEFT A SHEER DROP beyond the guard
rail Tyler hits the brakes Wrenches at the wheel Grinds
the big rig along the guard rail throwing sparks

Too fast The rear wheels jump the rail The trailer tips
Tyler works the wheel and throttle trying to drag it back
No use The trailer separates and TUMBLES OVER THE EDGE

THE RIG ROLLS ONTO ITS SIDE GRINDS TO A STOP on the brink

Tyler climbs atop his overturned rig watching the trailer
roll slowly down the mountain strewing cargo crates He
sighs heavily Jumps down onto the roadway

Unbalanced the big rig TEETERS with a GROAN OF METAL Tyler
clutches at the tires trying in vain to hold it back

TYLER
No No

The rig tumbles down the mountain after the trailer

Sheppard looks on brow furrowed with disapproval

PROFESSOR SHEPPARD
Who’s the client now Some mobster

JENNY
The Pentagon actually

PROFESSOR SHEPPARD
What do they want with you You don’t
even know do you One of these days
your confidence will get you killed

JENNY
I know what I’m doing

PROFESSOR SHEPPARD

You’re smart But you lack reverence
This work is a sacred trust We trade
in swords and crowns Gods and demons
Powers that raised armies and toppled
empires The stone gods you dig up may
not be your gods But the mysteries
they stand for are real Respect them

Jenny studies him puzzled and amused She doesn’t get it

JENNY
I got a plane to catch

EXT RAMSTEIN AIR BASE GERMANY - DAY

From this base America projects air power to the Middle East
The runways rumble with fighter jets and cargo planes

SUPER RAMSTEIN AIR FORCE BASE GERMANY

Jenny debarks from an American military transport plane
Forster greets her at the foot of the ramp

FORSTER
Dr Halsey Colonel Gideon Forster
Department of Defense

RUNWAY
Forster walks with Jenny toward a complex of hangars

JENNY
You want me to help you plunder a
burial site

FORSTER
We’re extracting an artifact of
military value I need you to learn
everything you can about it Age
culture of origin associated names
or entities

JENNY
Colonel I don’t know where you got
my name But this is not what I do

Forster turns on her his demeanor hardening

FORSTER
I know exactly what you do Dr
Halsey I have a file documenting
your dealings with dozens of
gangsters smugglers and black
marketeers who pay you handsomely
for God knows what services

Jenny stares at him in astonishment caught flat-footed

FORSTER (CONTD)
I can pay your usual fee and be one
more client you don’t talk about
or I can send my file to Interpol

He lets the threat hang in the air She studies him A beat

JENNY
Twice my usual fee

INT HANGAR - DAY

A huge vacant space At a folding table Tyler studies a map
of Iraq He looks up as Forster leads Jenny in

TYLER
We need to get in and out fast or
we’ll catch more heat than we can
handle

FORSTER
Tyler Jennifer Halsey Expert on
the Ancient Near East Tyler Colt

Tyler clocks Jenny and dismisses her A decorative civilian

TYLER
What are my assets Apart from her

Jenny stares at him Excuse me
FORSTER
Twelve specialists out of the Army
Corps of Engineers
Tyler nods Good start He taps the map
TYLER
This desert’s held by tribal warlords
Even with a fast turnaround we’ll want

security SEALs Rangers

Forster nods Done But Jenny frowns at the map

JENNY
That’s strange

TYLER
What

JENNY

Iraq’s riddled with ruins but
they’re all in the river valleys
No one built out here in the open
desert Are we sure

Tyler turns on her in annoyance

TYLER
If one more person calls me crazy

Forster holds up a forestalling hand

FORSTER
How do we operate inside the tomb

Tyler gets back on task Stares into space thinking

TYLER
This thing comes on like voices in
your ears We need countermeasures
Not just ear protection Antisound
We want to hear nothing And no
radio links between the men
Everybody wears a hazmat suit Self-
contained air supplies

FORSTER
Shielded for electromagnetics

TYLER
Yeah And no weapons If the voices
get to us we’ll turn on each other

Jenny looks at Tyler incredulously

JENNY
Can other people hear these voices
or is it just you

Tyler glares at Forster furious

TYLER
Why is she here

FORSTER
Because she knows more about the
ancient world than you know about
the modern one Make it work

A RUMBLE behind them An armored Oshkosh cargo truck rolls
into the hangar The Army Corps of Engineers A dozen
ENGINEERS in field uniforms jump down off the flatbed

Tyler stalks away to meet them Jenny watches him go

JENNY
We’re following him into the desert

FORSTER
Tyler served with the SEALs and the
CIA He’s been undercover with arms
dealers Embedded with resistance
fighters He’s operated in every war
zone on the globe Best of the best

JENNY
So what happened to him

Forster hands Jenny a thick folder

FORSTER
He walked into that tomb

Jenny opens the folder the file on the Crossbow mission
Pictures of the doomed SEAL Team Tactical maps Depositions
and transcripts She starts reading

LATER

The Engineers unpack HAZMAT SUITS and breathing apparatus A
pair of UP-ARMORED HUMVEES drives into the hangar A squad of
four ARMY RANGERS jumps out and starts unloading guns

Tyler sits loading rifle clips from a box marked INCENDIARY
AMMUNITION He wraps each clip in red tape Forster stands
over him mid-argument

FORSTER
We don’t need a helicopter We all
fit on the plane

TYLER
That cargo plane’s a fat target we
need a gunship to defend it And
that’s my ride No way in hell do I
get on a plane with that thing

FORSTER
Tyler

TYLER
Helicopter

Forster looks tense He nods curtly and hurries away Jenny
approaches with the Crossbow file Tyler recognizes it

TYLER (CONTD)
He gave you my file

JENNY
Unbelievable stuff And I mean that
literally Did you draw this

She points at a page a reproduction of a hand-drawn map

TYLER
Yeah

JENNY
It’s good work Classic bronze-age
tomb But these guardian statues -
they’re turned around They should
face out These face inward

TYLER
That’s how they were Look Doc

JENNY
Jenny

TYLER
That tomb’s no place you want to be
I don’t want you there Walk away

JENNY
I can’t Forster’s got a file on me
too But even if he didn’tthat
tomb is a major find I’m going

EXT RUNWAY - DAY

A colossal C-17 GLOBEMASTER CARGO PLANE sits on the tarmac
tailgate down The Engineers back the cargo truck - loaded
with Bobcat digging machines - into the cargo bay

Forster leads Jenny and Tyler up the tailgate into the plane
EXT IRAQI DESERT - TOMB ENTRANCE - NIGHT

A digging machine ROARS up out of the tomb loaded with
broken stone

The abandoned trucks of the tomb robbers are still here
windows shattered tires flat drifted into the sand

Forster’s convoy now stands beside them two armored Humvees
and the Oshkosh cargo truck The four Army Rangers man
defensive position around the site

WORKLIGHTS illuminate the tomb as the Engineers excavate the
entrance Beside them Jenny pores over the ancient carvings
She walks back to Tyler and Forster where they stand on a
rise overlooking the scene She’s thrilled by the site

JENNY
The tomb is Assyrian That writing
around the door Curses Keep out
Abandon hope ye who enter here

A shout from the Engineers at the tomb’s entrance

ENGINEER
We’re through

MINUTES LATER

The twelve Engineers gather before Tyler Jenny and Forster
Everyone wears WHITE HAZMAT SUITS with air supplies Headgear
under their arms They carry scientific instruments

Tyler’s packing an M79 grenade launcher and a bandolier of
grenades Pistol on his hip Submachine gun on his back His
AMMO CLIPS ARE MARKED WITH RED TAPE incendiary rounds

TYLER
There is some next-level badness
down that hole Keep your gloves on
Check your seals Watch your air
supply You start hearing voices
Walk out Follow the cable to the
surface Go straight to the medic

He points at the MEDIC beside his gear

TYLER (CONTD)
Watch each other for the signs
The sweats The shakes Crazy eye
Sudden aggression That’s why
nobody’s got weapons

ENGINEER 2
You’ve got weapons

TYLER
It’s not my first rodeo I’m here to
watch your backs Suit up

The Engineers pull on ANTISOUND HEADSETS AND HAZMAT HOODS
Tyler hesitates staring at the tomb Forster notices

FORSTER
We have all your precautions in
place We’re good

TYLER
Nothing here is good

He pulls on his headgear ALL SOUND IS SILENCED A purr of
WHITE NOISE He leads the team into the tomb Forster and
Jenny right behind him The Engineers bringing up the rear

The last man carries a spool of yellow cable that unrolls
behind them Like astronauts they follow Tyler into the dark

INT TOMB - PASSAGEWAY
Their floodlights bathe the walls in a harsh white glare We
hear as they do sand crunching underfoot Their breathing

The purr of ventilators

Forster carries a MAGNETOMETER that detects electric and
magnetic flux across all bands He sweeps the walls with it

Jenny looks around in wonder Steps aside to photograph the
walls The light fades The unspooling cable bumps against
her feet she’s lagged behind She hurries to catch up
ANTECHAMBER

It’s a heroic act for Tyler to enter this chamber Here his
men fell and the dead rose But there are no bodies on the
ground The blood on the walls has faded Tyler frowns

He spots an age-browned SKULL FRAGMENT on the floor Beside
it an AK-47 engulfed in rust He picks it up the gun falls
apart in his hand - as if a thousand years have passed

FLASHES as Jenny enters taking pictures

Foster’s watching his instruments He signals keep moving

LABYRINTH

Tyler leads the team into the maze One of their floodlights
FLARES and BURNS OUT Moments later another An Engineer
falters Drops his gear Stumbles back the way they came
groping along the yellow cable

At an intersection Tyler pauses - remembering his way Points
down a passage Forster sweeps with his magnetometer field
readings spike in that direction He signals the advance

SARCOPHAGUS CHAMBER

Tyler leads the team in The bronze braziers are unlit The
gods of ancient Assyria glare down from the walls The black
iron SARCOPHAGUS lies on its plinth of stone

Forster stares at his magnetometer readings off the scale

Jenny approaches the sarcophagus overwhelmed Reads the gold
tracery Agitated she tears off her headgear Tyler gives
her the signal to put her headgear back on She ignores it
He pulls off his own hood furiously

TYLER
You Suit up

JENNY
This is Ashurbanipal The last
great king of Assyria

TYLER
Great Put your headgear on

JENNY
(tracing the engraving)
Assyrian text Egyptian symbols

TYLER
Hands off the box

Impatiently Forster signals the Engineers to start the
extraction Pulls his own headgear off

FORSTER
What’s the problem

TYLER
Your “expert”

JENNY
This is the greatest find since
King Tut’s tomb We can’t just grab
the sarcophagus and leave

A GHOSTLY WHISPER in old Akkadian Tyler stiffens

JENNY (CONTD)
Did you hear that

FORSTER
I feel it Working on my mind
I’ve never felt power like this

He sounds daunted Tyler’s trembling He pulls his pistol
Aims it at Jenny Struggling to keep his voice under control

TYLER
Headgear

FORSTER
Tyler

Tyler points the gun at Forster He’s at the end of his rope

TYLER
Both of you Now

Forster complies Jenny looks defiantbut obeys Tyler
holsters his gun and suits up plunging back into silence

The Engineers assemble a KEVLAR SHELL around the sarcophagus
Attach gas cylinders Flood the shell with argon gas And
then one by one the team’s FLOODLIGHTS BURN OUT - plunging
them into UTTER DARKNESS A second of terror

PAFFF Tyler holds a magnesium flare overhead In the red
glare he signals the team Go Go

LABYRINTH

Tyler strides through the tunnels - a burning flare in one
hand machine gun in the other Jenny at his side

Forster follows with the Engineers carrying the sarcophagus
on their shoulders like pallbearers A few hold burning
flares aloft Like monks in an otherworldly catacomb

EXT TOMB ENTRANCE - DAWN

The sky is brightening as the team carries the sarcophagus
into the open air Tyler waves them toward the cargo truck

He pulls off his headgear Looks at the Engineer sitting with
the medic the one who walked out

TYLER

MEDIC
Panic attack He’s all right

FORSTER

EXT IRAQI DESERT - PRE-DAWN

The convoy barrels across the desert The Rangers lead the
column in one Humvee Then the cargo truck hazmat-suited
Engineers riding with the sarcophagus

Lastly the second Humvee Forster at the wheel with Tyler
riding shotgun and Jenny in back They’ve shed their hazmat
suits Tyler has his weapons slung

They pass a boundary stone - a kudurru Jenny notices it’s
one of many marching in a VAST RING AROUND THE TOMB She
swings her camera around to photograph them

INT TYLER’S HUMVEE (IN MOTION) - DAY
The convoy speeds toward the waiting aircraft

The Black Hawk’s rotor is turning The C-17’s engines rumble
The plane’s ramp is down its cargo hold an empty cavern

FORSTER
It might be better for the team if
you stayed with the package

TYLER
I am not flying with that -

KA-BLAM AN EXPLOSION FLIPS THE LEAD HUMVEE INTO THE AIR It
lands on its roof on fire Scratch one squad of Army Rangers

A SECOND BLAST DESTROYS THE CAB OF THE CARGO TRUCK crippling
the truck it grinds to a halt twenty yards from the plane

FORSTER

Four “TECHNICALS” roar in across the salt flat pickup trucks
with heavy machine guns mounted in back TRIBAL WARRIORS with
AK-47s and RPGs ride five to a truck

An RPG just misses their Humvee - and BLOWS UP THE BLACK
HAWK The helicopter dissolves into flames Jenny screams
Tyler stares at the wreckage in dismay There goes his ride

Bullets ricochet around them Tyler takes command by reflex
He grabs Jenny’s arm His focus cuts through her terror

TYLER
Get out and stay low When I start
shooting run to the truck They’re
gonna have to load the sarcophagus
by hand You’re in charge

She nods white-faced Gets out Tyler stands up into the gun
turret Swings the SAW around Bangs on the roof

TYLER (CONTD)

He starts shooting Jenny runs Foster sets his jaw and puts
the pedal down The Humvee leaps forward Tyler fires in long
bursts swinging the gun from one target to another

AT THE CARGO TRUCK

Jenny arrives at a run the Hazmat-suited Engineers are
huddled in panic A few of them peeling off their headgear

In combat sign language she orders them to keep their gear on
and lift the sarcophagus She gets them moving

ON THE SALT FLAT
Tyler and Forster play defense veering to cut off the tribal
warriors’ trucks as they approach Tyler fires his GRENADE
LAUNCHER rolling an enemy truck
He looks back the Engineers lug the coffin toward the plane
TYLER (CONTD)

aboard

FORSTER
What about us

TYLER
Tell ‘em leave the ramp down

AT THE C-17
Jenny leads the Engineers up the ramp with the sarcophagus
The C-17 LUMBERS INTO MOTION engines howling Jenny looks

around in confusion Tyler and Forster aren’t on board yet

JENNY
Wait

IN THE HUMVEE

Tyler empties his grenade launcher Drops it Switches to the
turret gun An RPG whistles past - too close

TYLER
Time to go

Forster slews the Humvee around chasing the C-17 They blow
out a rear tire losing precious speed A fuel can on the
exterior CATCHES FIRE Tyler blasts away with the turret gun
The C-17’s nose comes off the ground Takeoff speed
Tyler ducks inside as the Humvee charges through the wash of
the giant engines It slams up the ramp bullet-riddled and

burning an instant before the ramp lifts off the ground

The engine wash rolls the pursuing trucks off their tires
They tumble across the salt flat as the C-17 climbs away

A PILOT and COPILOT guide the C-17 into the safe upper air
Behind them Forster Tyler and Jenny drop into jump seats

He has the look of a man who’s won an auction with a bid he
can’t afford to pay

TYLER
You in trouble

FORSTER
I’1l handle it When they see what
I’ve found - all will be forgiven

He falls back in his seat and closes his eyes Tyler looks at
Jenny she’s scribbling furiously in her sketchbook

horrifying drawings from the tomb

Tyler twitches - hounded by nightmares

UNDERWORLD - ENDLESS STAIR

A spiral stair descends into darkness TREE ROOTS have choked
the stairwell twisting through the rock Terrifying noises
from below rumbles crashes muttering voices

The DEAD KING his skin inked with warding glyphs struggles
down the stair - fighting through the gnarled roots

An EERIE LIGHT approaches from below In terror the Dead King
worms into a crevice in the wall Hiding among the roots

A DEMON climbs past ascending the stair a skeletal monster
with a hawklike head It carries a wicked hooked blade that
glows with a blue light

When the demon has passed the Dead King tries to emerge from
hiding - but THE ROOTS HOLD HIM FAST twined around him He
struggles to free himself The roots tighten entangling him
in strangling loops - and DRAG HIM SCREAMING INTO THE EARTH

Darkest cloud I’ve ever seen

The COLLISION RADAR starts BEEPING Tyler squints at the
stormcloud Something’s not right Horror fills his face

TYLER
That’s not a cloud

WE ZOOM THROUGH THE COCKPIT WINDOWS
rocketing across the sky to the black stormfront It’s a
FLOCK OF RAVENS Millions of them beating through the
tempest at an impossible altitude with strange purpose
The C-17 STRIKES THE RAVENS AT 450 KNOTS
At this speed a raven might as well be a cannonball The
bombardment streaks the C-17 with blood All four engines
BURST INTO FLAME

TYLER
All four engines on fire

He pushes them aft Forster wrenches open the hatch against
the howling wind and they dive into the

They slam the hatch shut behind them A THUNDERCLAP shakes
the plane The lights flicker

EVERY MAN IN THE CARGO BAY LIES DEAD

The Engineers the Medic the deck crew Their hoods and
headsets pulled off Their hands grip wrenches hammers

In the center of the bay the SARCOPHAGUS LIES EXPOSED Its
kevlar shell dismantled Loosely cabled to the bucking deck

Wind shrieks through the bay A few tattered crows flap
frantically around the interior

running aft means climbing the plane’s in a dive Forster
kneels over the fallen men Checks vital signs

when all around her THE DEAD STAND UP Heads lolling eyes
rolled back They clutch at her blindly Jenny screams

Tyler runs back down the tilted deck Wrenches Jenny free of
the clutching dead

One of them PULLS THE RIPCORD OF HER PARACHUTE - popping the
drone chute Hands tangle in the silk Her chute spills out
behind her as Tyler pulls her away She hits the end of her
shrouds and jerks to a stop Dead hands drag her backward

Help me

Tyler rips off her harness Drags her to the open tailgate

JENNY (CONTD)

break free and tumble on separate paths of ruin

Flames boil A pall of smoke adds its darkness to the storm

ground He spots Tyler’s parachute below him Pulls on his
shrouds banking through the stormwinds

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - ROOFTOP

Tyler and Jenny - sharing one parachute - descend fast onto
the roof Tyler lets her go she tumbles across the rooftop

Lightened Tyler is dragged across the roof He fights to get
out of his harness before he goes over the edge At the last
instant he gets free The parachute flaps away like a ghost

He stands in the rain looking at the column of smoke boiling
up from the crash site half a mile away Furious He can’t
believe he went along with this He knew better

Jenny joins him at the roof’s edge He turns to her - and she
begins to PUMMEL HIM WITH HER FISTS

It was on fire

JENNY
You threw me out of a PLANE

Tyler fends off her blows Pulls her in

TYLER
You’re okay You’re on the ground
Youre safe

just seen the impossible and her mind’s in rebellion

What was THAT The storm Dead men
Maybemaybe they weren’t dead
Their vital signs were just

Out of the wreckage crawls THE MUMMY Skin BLACK AS TAR body
wasted to the bone It rises to its feet gaunt and terrible

DRIVES THE BRONZE PIPES IN ITS WRISTS into the man’s throat

The old man convulses - held by the Mummy’s gaze A strange
intimate bond as blood and life flows from the living to the
dead The ancient body fills out slightly The Mummy takes
its first ragged breath as the old man breathes his last

Another victim calls out in the storm A WOMAN The Mummy’s
head turns hungrily It stalks toward the voice

Left behind the old man’s body stares at the stormy sky
Hands clawed eyes wide mouth frozen in a silent scream

fuselage Steps through a doorway in a free-standing wall On
the far side only rubble The search seems hopeless

A sound The CAWING OF CROWS He looks up The roof of the
Abbey is COVERED WITH RAVENS Tyler prowls forward nervously
Beside the shattered Abbey he stops and crouches Picks up a
FRAGMENT OF BLACK IRON A PIECE OF THE SARCOPHAGUS

The Abbey’s WINE CELLAR has been laid open by the crash He
peers down into the dark His hand strays to his gun

Jenny appears beside him making him jump

JENNY
What do you see

He passes her the fragment of engraved iron

JENNY (CONTD)
Oh no

Tyler throws Forster a hand signal across the field Here He
pulls out a tactical flashlight Shines it into the pit

TYLER
We can climb down if we’re careful
There’s handholds -
Jenny leaps into the crypt Tyler blinks

TYLER (CONTD)
Okay

He leaps down after her
INT CELLAR

The sarcophagus having blasted through the ancient wall
lies shattered in the wreckage of wine casks and masonry

Tyler lifts his tactical light A hand on his gun He sweeps
the shadows and corners braced for some dark manifestation

Jenny kneels in the rubble with her own flashlight She finds
fragments of engraved black iron Lays them out Forster
climbs down behind them

TYLER
You feeling anything Whispers

Forster shakes his head
FORSTER

Maybe it’s over Break the artifact
break the spell

TYLER
It was never the box It was the
thing inside Ash

JENNY
Ashurbanipal If his remains are
here they won’t be hard to find
He’d be buried in gold and jewels

TYLER
No gold They shaved off his beard
and hair and sealed him in hot tar

Jenny’s head comes around sharply

JENNY
How could you know that

TYLER
I dreamed it

A SCREAM makes Tyler spin It came from up above

TYLER (CONTD)
Stay with her

He rockets up out of the cellar leaping from wall to wall
with startling athleticism and disappears into the rain

EXT RUINED ABBEY - DAY

Around the corner from the opened cellar a knot of policemen
and medics stand huddled in the downpour Tyler joins them
They’ve found the Mummy’s first victim the OLD MAN his
alabaster-pale face set in a rictus of terror

Twenty paces away more police cluster around a DEAD WOMAN
She too has bloodless white skin frozen in a silent scream

Forster appears beside Tyler taking in the ghastly scene
Tyler looks at him shaken

TYLER
This was him

FORSTER
You don’t know that

TYLER
What then Natural causes They’re
just really scared of plane crashes
The thing in the box is out
(realizing)
You left Jenny alone

INT CELLAR - DAY

Jenny has laid out the major fragments of the sarcophagus
She studies the engravings poring over the text

In the DRAINAGE TUNNEL BEHIND HER - movement The MUMMY peers
out of the darkness a skeletal ghoul with broken pipes
jutting from its wrists neck and chest It creeps closer

Jenny oblivious to its presence begins to READ ALOUD IN
ANCIENT AKKADIAN - frightened by what she’s reading

The Mummy freezes in astonishment Cocks its head and stares
at her with slitted eyes Listening

Tyler CRASHES DOWN into the cellar making Jenny gasp He
pulls his pistol and flashlight Sweeps the cellar

JENNY
What are you doing

Tyler shines his light into the tunnel The Mummy is gone

TYLER
You see anything strange

JENNY
Yes The Assyrians wrapped their dead
in shrouds - but they didn’t embalm
them like the Egyptians But look

She turns over a large fragment of the sarcophagus lid which
would have covered the head and torso of its occupant

Molded to fit the body the lid is VEINED WITH TUBES AND
RESERVOIRS OF BRONZE Some of the tubes - broken off - plunge
into the space the corpse would have occupied

JENNY (CONTD)
This intricate mechanism Reservoirs
for some sort of fluid Pipes
designed to penetrate the body
(reading the reservoirs)
“Blood of dreams Blood of night
Blood of returning”

One of the pipes runs to a CLOCKWORK APPARATUS on the
sarcophagus lid she works it with her hand and A BARBED
NEEDLE juts from a handprint on the lid

JENNY (CONTD)
“Blood of the Chosen”

Tyler looks at the scar on his palm Closes his fist over it

JENNY (CONTD)
This is sorcery to raise the dead

We FLY PAST Tyler and plunge into the dark DRAINAGE TUNNEL
UNDERGROUND PIPES - CONTINUOUS

We race through ancient drainways Across a flooded cistern
UP a vertical drain through a splatter of falling water

THE MUMMY is climbing the drain The jagged pipes in its
wrists leaving scratches on the stones

EXT ALLEYWAY - DUSK
Night is falling A pelting rain beats the cobblestones

An IRON GRATE BREAKS FREE from its cemented moorings THE
MUMMY CLIMBS OUT into the twilight Rises to its full height
a gaunt black figure in the shreds of its burial wrappings

It walks to the mouth of the alley and looks at Rome
INT FORSTER’S BASE

Alone in his abandoned shop Forster paces restlessly -
circling his comm terminal like he’s afraid to look at it

AMBASSADOR SLADE (0S)
Colonel Forster

Forster jumps at the sound Slade steps inside shaking rain
from his umbrella Outside four Marines stand guard

FORSTER
Ambassador

He’s forcing his usual confident tone - but there’s a crack
in it Ambassador Slade has blood in his eye

AMBASSADOR SLADE

I tracked down your Special Weapons
Group - which I’d never heard of
by the way Got your supervisor
Know what he told me There IS no
go mission to Iraq Nobody knows
youre here

(with savage triumph)
Youre off the reservation You’re
single-handedly responsible for
that nightmare out there

FORSTER
Yes I am

He sounds like a man before a firing squad

The Ambassador looms in Forster’s face enjoying his ruin

AMBASSADOR SLADE
I don’t know whether we’ll crucify
you in the public square or bury
you by dark of night but either
way Ill enjoy it

He turns to summon his Marines

FORSTER
Ambassador
(desperately)
I can explain Just look at this

He passes a TABLET COMPUTER to Slade and taps the screen

AMBASSADOR SLADE
Nothing you can show me will

He trails off A SHIFTING DIGITAL PATTERN flickers on the
tablet’s screen Slade stares into the light HYPNOTIZED

Shielding his eyes Forster turns off the tablet and takes it
back The Ambassador stands STIFF AS A STATUE hand
outstretched mouth open Staring at nothing

Forster packs up his things Slips out the back of the shop
INT CELLAR - DUSK
Tyler stares at Jenny across the shattered sarcophagus
JENNY

We won’t find the king’s remains

If there was moisture in this

sarcophagus as these tubes imply -

the body would have rotted away to

nothing in two thousand years

TYLER
I think we won’t find his body
because he went for a little walk

JENNY
Tyler

TYLER
Let’s get out of this hole

EXT RUINED ABBEY - DUSK
Tyler climbs out of the cellar Pulls Jenny up into the rain

JENNY
A two-thousand-year-old man can’t -

She GASPS Tyler spins to find TWO MARINES behind him

MARINE 1
Tyler Colt Jennifer Halsey You‘re
under arrest by order of the DCIS

JENNY
The what

TYLER
Pentagon criminal investigations
On what charges

MARINE 2
Impersonating an active-duty
serviceman Falsifying orders
Fraudulent requisition of material
and personnel Desecration of a
religious site Crossing borders for
illegal purposes Conduct resulting
in the death of military personnel

Tyler closes his eyes in dismay

TYLER
Forster What did you do

The Marines pull handcuffs Reach for Tyler and Jenny

TYLER (CONTD)
Listen you can’t take us in We set
something loose here

MARINE 2
Tell it to the judge

Tyler becomes a blur of motion He gets each Marine by a
wrist Twists them together Takes their handcuffs away
They go for their guns He takes the guns away

Seconds after the fracas started the Marines are handcuffed
together on their knees Tyler points both guns at them

MARINE 1
They’11l lock you up for the rest
of your life

PAFF PAFF TRANQUILIZER DARTS appear in the Marines’ necks
They slump unconscious

FORSTER
Not just yet

He slips a slim dart pistol into his jacket

JENNY
What the hell is going on

Forster’s shoulders crumple His facade finally collapsing

FORSTER
I couldn’t get approval for the
mission Too speculative Too
costly SoI set it up on my own

TYLER
You forged your orders

FORSTER
Indelicate phrasing But yes

Tyler seizes him by the collar Slams him against the wall

TYLER
People died We were in combat We
crashed a plane into a goddamned
city We’ll all go to prison

JENNY
Tyler

Strangling Forster croaks something unintelligible

TYLER
What’s he saying

JENNY
I think he’s saying “You need me”

Tyler gives Forster some air

FORSTER
(hoarsely)
You need me To clear your name I
did this Ill take the heat I’1l
get you out of this I promise

Tyler releases him reluctantly Forster gulps air
Two Italian POLICE OFFICERS run toward them shouting They
stiffen in fight-or-flight panicbut the officers run right

past them shouting into radios in Italian

JENNY
They said the Devil killed again

EXT - NARROW STREET - NIGHT
Forster Tyler and Jenny hurry through the gathering dark

They see a cluster of policemen a MURDER SCENE A muscular
man lies dead pale and frozen in a tableau of horror

The policemen argue Some point away down the street ona
distant corner a second knot of policemen stand under a
streetlight A second murder scene

STREET CORNER

Tyler Jenny and Forster arrive at the second murder scene
stopping a discreet distance away This victim is an OLD
WOMAN pale and frozen in terror like the others

FORSTER
Why these people Men women
young old

Tyler looks back the way they came - and he sees it

TYLER
He’s not choosing victims They’re
just in his way He’s moving ina
straight line Where does this go

They stare at him in confusion Tyler turns and runs down the
street - emerging at the end of the block into

ST PETER’S SQUARE

A wide plaza surrounded by a colonnade Beautiful even on
this rainy night Across the plaza A MIGHTY DOMED CATHEDRAL
Jenny arrives beside Tyler They stare at the church

JENNY
St Peter’s Basilica The Vatican

Lightning flashes Thunder BOOMS A SCREAM echoes across the
plaza A terrified PRIEST flees weeping through the square

PRIEST
Il diavolo Il diavolo Dio ci salvi

INT VATICAN LIBRARY - GALLERY - NIGHT

A hall beautiful as a Fabergé egg even in this dim light its
walls and arched ceiling adorned with frescoes and gold

At the end of the gallery a towering double door of bronze
As we watch the doors RUST AND CORRODE Dark veins of rot
spread The doors GROAN BUCKLE - and BURST OPEN

The Mummy walks in He stands tall now gaunt shoulders
straight skull-like head lifted imperiously

He walks down the gallery and corruption walks with him -
veins of decay spreading over the floors and walls Tiles and
windowpanes crack Paint peels When the Mummy is roused his
touch carries all the wasting power of twenty-six centuries

There’s a RUMBLE in the air It seems the floor sags under
his weight The Devil has come to the house of God

EXT ST PETER’S SQUARE - NIGHT

Tyler winces rubbing the scar on his palm as if it burns
him He passes his hand through the air experimentally like
a man testing the wind Points across the square

TYLER
That way

FORSTER
Youre sure

Tyler trots ahead Forster and Jenny hurry after him Behind
them policemen flood into the plaza Sirens wail

COLONNADE

Like a bloodhound on the scent Tyler leads Forster and Jenny
through a high archway into a narrow Vatican City street
Jenny catches up to him looking nervous

JENNY
Tyler The Assyrians were the
bloodiest empire in history They
used terror as a weapon Skinned
people alive Impaled them on
stakes Sealed them up in walls
Made heaps of human heads

Tyler turns on her more than a little freaked out

TYLER
Where are you going with this

JENNY
Ashurbanipal was the cruelest king
Assyria ever had Wed be better
off waking up Genghis Khan or
Attila the Hun If this is him

TYLER
So you do believe it Jenny Let
the cops take you somewhere safe
You shouldn’t be here

Jennys not having this chivalry for a second

JENNY
Without me you have no idea who
youre dealing with And if there’s
a two-thousand-year-old man walking
around I’m not going to miss it

FORSTER
Good We need to stay together This
is proof of a power greater than
death We have to bring it back

They come to a GUARD LYING DEAD before a grand building
Behind him the bronze double doors are blasted inward

JENNY
This is the Vatican Library

TYLER
He came straight here I think it’s
no accident we crashed in Rome

VATICAN LIBRARY - READING ROOM
A great hall ringed with balconies Walls lined with books

The Mummy has two ACOLYTES by the throats bronze pipes
impaling their necks Their feet dangling above the marble
floor They die in his hands

A CLATTER The Mummy drops his victims and looks up A DARK
BEARDED PRIEST stares in shock across the hall But he does
not flee He is a trained EXORCIST He’s faced evil before

The Exorcist clutches his rosary Lifts a Bible off a shelf
Brandishing the Book he begins A PRAYER OF EXORCISM His
voice resonant His tongue like a lash

Shreds of darkness unravel from the Mummy’s body blowing
away like ash on the wind The prayer has real power

The Mummy snarls - and exerts his own power Veins of
corruption spread outward like a spiderweb across the floor
The Mummy SPEAKS AN INCANTATION - his harsh Akkadian words
clashing with the priest’s sonorous Latin

The Exorcist falters sweat beading on his brow Swallows
Coughs up a PUFF OF DUST

He struggles to speak and chokes Dry sand pours from his

mouth He falls to his knees vomiting sand in impossible

quantities and DIES Sand spilling from his open jaws

The Mummy steps over him

VATICAN LIBRARY - CORRIDOR

Tyler Forster and Jenny stride down a long passage
FORSTER

What do the legends say about how
to fight the dead

JENNY
The Assyrians were terrified of the
dead coming back They buried the
dead with food so they wouldn’t get
hungry and crawl out of their
graves If they do come back -
you fight them with fire

Tyler pats his pistol with its clip of incendiary rounds

TYLER
Already worked that out What else
you got

JENNY

Salt was used for purification
It might help

TYLER
Now you tell me

JENNY
And don’t look a ghost in the eye
Itll drink the life out of you

READING ROOM

Tyler leads Forster and Jenny into the reading room - and
stops cold The two ACOLYTES and the EXORCIST lie dead on the
floor Furniture overturned Corrosion everywhere

Tyler draws his gun They cross the hall cautiously

A WHISPER in the hall Ancient Akkadian voices chanting
The policemen cross themselves and mutter prayers

FORSTER
Tyler

The DEAD PRIESTS ON THE FLOOR STAND UP the two Acolytes
behind the policemen the Exorcist behind the Americans
Their eyes rolled back Their heads at unnatural angles

Forster retreats before the Dead Exorcist firing round after
round into the undead priest The Dead Exorcist BLEEDS SAND
from every bullethole and keeps coming

TYLER
Forgive me Father

He FIRES two incendiary rounds THE DEAD EXORCIST IGNITES A
WALKING TORCH Burning fiercely he collapses

Tyler turns Shoots the Dead Acolytes They too burn with
unnatural ferocity dropping lifeless to the marble floor

The Americans stand breathing raggedly Their eyes meet

TYLER (CONTD)
Score one for fire

SECRET ARCHIVE - ENTRANCE

The Mummy’s trail of decay leads to a marble portico A heavy
door stands askew on its hinges broken open

JENNY
The Vaticans Secret Archive Only
a handful of people have seen it

SECRET ARCHIVE

Tyler Forster and Jenny enter the Library’s inner sanctum
Walls and pillars of pale stone From the central chamber
archways lead to RELIQUARIES

In the center of the chamber on an ancient marble podium
lies a GRAY-HAIRED PRIEST in an ornate red-trimmed cassock
The Vatican Library’s ARCHIVIST He seems dead As they draw
near HE LIFTS HIS HEAD moaning

Tyler’s gun snaps up - but Jenny pushes it aside She rushes
to the Archivist cradling his head

JENNY
He’s alive

A HORRENDOUS CRASH A DEMONIC ROAR too grating and monstrous
for a living throat It’s coming from one of the reliquaries

Tyler and Forster move toward the terrifying sounds

Forster pulls out his DART PISTOL Ejects the clip of sleep
darts and loads a new clip darker darts with longer needles

TYLER
What’s that

FORSTER
Cocktail of synthetic poisons
Stop any metabolic process known
to science

BACK AT THE LECTERN

The dying Archivist clutches Jenny’s shoulders with desperate
strength His body shakes His voice a hoarse whisper

ARCHIVIST
(in Italian subtitled)
Listen Listen to me

JENNY
(in Italian subtitled)
Im here Father

RELIQUARY

An antiquarian’s treasure house a stone hall of many shelves
filled with ancient books wooden chests and metal coffers

Tyler and Forster enter DEMONIC ROARS AND CRASHES echo

At their feet lies a PRIEST in trousers and undershirt Tyler
checks his pulse gun at the ready The body is lifeless

The Reliquary is cross-shaped they turn the corner to see
THE MUMMY PILLAGING THE ARCHIVES Smashing chests and
overturning shelves He wears a BLACK PRIEST’S CASSOCK
Cursing and snarling in furious Akkadian as he searches

Forster stares at this apparition in stunned horror

FORSTER
We should’ve left it in the ground

The Mummy turns Walks toward them across the Reliquary - and
locks eyes with Tyler

MATCH-CUT FLASH King Ashurbanipal bearded and armored on a
Babylonian battlefield

MATCH-CUT FLASH The Dead King shaven and bald in a hellish
valley of the Underworld

MATCH-CUT FLASH the Mummy in the Reliquary glaring at him

ASHURBANIPAL

You

Tyler FIRES SIX INCENDIARY ROUNDS into the Mummy’s chest But
the Mummy doesn’t burst into flame like the lesser undead
The flaming bulletholes gutter out and close up

TYLER
Ah hell

Forster empties his clip of poison darts into the Mummy’s
body The Mummy plucks them out and drops them laughing a
sound like stone grating on stone

TYLER (CONTD)
(aside to Forster)
Got any salt

CENTRAL CHAMBER

Jenny cradles the dying Archivist The life going out of him
They speak Italian but we hear English

ARCHIVIST
He must not find it

JENNY
Find what Father

ARCHIVIST
The King’s Legacy He will open the
gates of Hell

RELIQUARY

Tyler and Forster retreat before the advancing Mummy Too
late Tyler sees they’ve backed into a dead end Cornered

Forster pulls a HIGH-TECH DAGGER out of his jacket ELECTRIC
ARCS crackle down the eight-inch blade

FORSTER
One last card to play

He charges the Mummy

TYLER
Forster No

He brings his gun up Sidesteps to clear his line of fire and
shoots BLAM Puts one in the Mummy’s forehead

The shot throws the Mummy off-balance for a precious instant
Forster PLANTS HIS KNIFE IN ITS CHEST with a triumphant roar
Electric arcs sizzle over the Mummy’s shuddering body

The triumph is fleeting The Mummy seizes Forster by his
wrists forcing him to his knees The burning bullethole in
its forehead closes up It yanks the dagger from its chest

FORSTER
(to Tyler in agony)
Run

Tyler fires three rounds into the Mummy His pistol’s slide
kicks back Empty clip The Mummy raises the knife high

FORSTER (CONTD)
RUN

The KNIFE SLAMS DOWN into Forster’s chest ARTIFICIAL
LIGHTNING crackles over him Forster falls dead

The Mummy looks up at Tyler - and EXERTS HIS POWER The
Reliquary darkens Decay and corruption spread outward from
him The air fills with whispering voices

Tyler RUNS
CENTRAL CHAMBER
The Archivist whispers his last words in Jenny’s ear - and

falls back dead His limp fingers leave a RING OF ANCIENT
KEYS in Jenny’s hand

Tyler sprints in jacking a fresh clip into his gun

TYLER
Go Go

JENNY
Where’s Forster

TYLER
Dead

Jenny is shocked silent He takes her hand and pulls her into
motion - frantic but unsure where to go Darkness approaches
from the Reliquary Ghost voices whispering

TYLER (CONTD)
Police have the place surrounded
We go out we go to prison

Jenny holds up the keys Pulls him away

JENNY
We’re not going out We’re going down

TYLER
That’s what I’m afraid of

CATACOMB GATE
Jenny pulls Tyler down a long stone staircase into darkness

TYLER
We’re rats in a hole down here

JENNY
Trust me

At the bottom a MASSIVE BRASS GATE decorated with ornate
crosses Jenny fumbles for the key that fits the heavy lock

JENNY (CONTD)
The old man was the Head Archivist
of the Vatican Library

(MORE)

JENNY (CONTD)
He said “the Dead King’s looking for
his Legacy” And he told me where to
find it

A SHADOW falls over them The Mummy stands at the top of the
stairs in his black cassock He descends toward them

JENNY (CONTD)
Oh my God He’s real

TYLER
Go Go Go

Jenny gets the gate open They leap through Close it behind
them But THERE’S NO WAY TO LOCK THE GATE FROM THE INSIDE

Jenny reaches through the bars Trying to fit the key into
the lock It skids past the keyhole

JENNY
Please please please

She locks the gate and yanks her arm back - JUST AS THE MUMMY
MAKES A GRAB FOR HER The Mummy wrenches at the gate - but
the massive bars resist his strength
Jennys frozen in terror but her curiosity’s stronger still
JENNY (CONTD)
(in Akkadian subtitled)
Are you Ashurbanipal King of
Assyria
The Mummy glares at her with pure malevolence
THE MUMMY
(in Akkadian subtitled)
I am GIVE ME MY CROWN

He lunges through the bars at her Jenny recoils with a
shriek Tyler pulls her away They run into the darkness

The Mummy grips the gate RUST AND CORROSION spread outward
from his hands METAL GROANS STONE CRUMBLES

INT GROTTO

A warren of vaults dug into the stone beneath the Library
Tyler switches on his tactical light Every turn in the
labyrinth is marked with LATIN WORDS AND ROMAN NUMERALS
Jenny turns left right left reading the signs

Behind them - a SCREECH OF METAL A CRASH OF STONE

TYLER
He’s through
Jenny skids to a stop in front of a vault

JENNY
This one

Tyler kicks the old wooden door in

INT VAULT

A BRONZE CHEST is bolted to a plinth of stone Secured by an
ancient padlock On its lid a stylized FOUR-BARRED CROSS
Jenny touches the engraved symbol

JENNY
The Djed pillar Symbol of endurance

Jenny fumbles with keys Tyler pushes her aside SHATTERS THE
LOCK WITH A SINGLE GUNSHOT He wrenches the chest open

Inside nested in shaped beds they find a CROWN and a SEAL
The crown is a simple circlet set with red stones The seal
a carved cylinder of bronze the size of a rolling pin

Beside them an EMPTY IMPRINT the chest was also meant to
hold a SWORD with a distinctive blade But the sword is gone

Jenny PICKS UP THE CROWN
GROTTO - PASSAGEWAY

Hunting through the darkness for his prey the Mummy FEELS
THE THROB OF POWER as his crown is claimed by another

He ROARS For the first time we see him move in haste it’s
terrifying He lurches along monstrously but frighteningly
fast - breath rasping in his lungs Snarling ancient curses
VAULT

Tyler and Jenny hear him coming He pulls her into motion

An inscription on the wall catches her eye

JENNY
This way

ANCIENT PORTAL
An old iron door bars their way Jenny tries a key No luck
The rage of the Mummy grows louder closer Tyler raises his

gun aiming blindly into the darkness behind them

Jenny finds the right key The door opens They dive through

CATACOMBS

Winding tunnels dug out of raw limestone Tyler and Jenny run
through the labyrinth taking turns haphazardly

TYLER
You know where you’re going

JENNY
I’m taking anything that looks like
it leads up

They turn a corner - and the walls of the catacombs are
suddenly LINED WITH BONES Notches in the walls hold skulls
and bones in heaps Longer niches hold moldering coffins

In places the walls are PAVED WITH SKULLS Arches and
fanciful decorations all of bone Several intact SKELETONS
have been posed like statues in rotted priest’s robes

Tyler looks around like he’s fallen into a nightmare

TYLER
Are you kidding me with this

Spooked Jenny takes refuge in scholarship It’s her way

JENNY
Under pagan Rome Christianity went
underground They worshipped and
buried their dead in the catacombs
There’s miles of this

WHISPERS fill the tunnels around them Ancient incantations
Tylers eyes go wide as he sees where this is going

TYLER
We can’t be here

They run Tyler in the lead now tactical light clipped to
his pistol Dragging Jenny between walls lined with coffins

The whispers grow LOUDER The catacombs BEGIN TO STIR around
them SCRAPING AND BANGING inside the coffins The LIDS LIFT
AS BONY FINGERS CLAW OUT Jenny screams in terror

They run faster Bony hands reach out of coffins to pluck at
their sleeves erupt from the floor to clutch their ankles

TYLER (CONTD)
There

His light finds a SPIRAL STAIR leading up Jenny SHRIEKS
behind him He spins she’s trapped seized by bony hands

Tyler fires five rapid rounds severing five skeletal arms
with five bullets Jenny staggers free In the passageway
behind her WE SEE THE MUMMY LURCHING TOWARD THEM

SPIRAL STAIR

Tyler drags Jenny up the narrow ancient stairwell The growl
of the Mummy’s fury close behind them

INT MAUSOLEUM - NIGHT
The stair emerges in a marble mausoleum centuries old Dim
light filters in from outside through small metal gratings

On the side walls moldering coffins are stacked three deep

Tyler throws his shoulder against the massive bronze door
straining The hinges groan It doesn’t budge

WHISPERS echo below Black creepers of rot climb the walls
The coffins rattle and rock The Mummy is coming

JENNY
Oh God

She throws herself against the door They strain together
EXT CEMETERY - NIGHT

An ancient graveyard on the banks of the Tiber marble
monuments pale in the moonlight

A mausoleum’s door grinds open Tyler and Jenny squeeze out
and heave the door closed behind them

A marble ANGEL STATUE stands before the mausoleum Tyler
throws himself against it Walks his feet up the mausoleum
opposite straining with all his strength

The angel topples against the mausoleum door

Just in time A split second later the bronze door BOOMS as
some powerful force drives against it The Mummy’s voice

RAGES inside the mausoleum thundering Assyrian curses

TYLER
Go Go

They flee through the tombstones Behind them the mausoleum
RESOUNDS with heavy blows The door BENDS The walls CRACK

RIVER BRIDGE

Tyler and Jenny emerge from the cemetery onto a STONE BRIDGE
over the river They start across breathing hard

On the river below a PARTY BARGE floats by - café tables and
a little dance floor dance music pumping

TYLER
Come on

He times the moment JUMPS OFF THE BRIDGE

PARTY BARGE

Tyler lands on the tail of the barge This seems to be
lovers’ lane he startles several couples out of amorous
clinches Tyler looks up Spreads his arms

RIVER BRIDGE

Jenny hesitates on the parapet losing her nerve Tyler walks
aft on the barge below he’s running out of boat

An ECHOING CRASH OF STONE from the cemetery Jenny jumps
PARTY BARGE

Teetering on the tail of the barge Tyler catches Jenny and
swings her to safety The lovers stare at them in amazement

Jenny looks back A DARK FIGURE stands on the bridge
watching them as a bend in the river sweeps them out of view

PARTY BARGE - DANCE FLOOR

Tyler and Jenny press through a packed dance floor Spirits
are high A woman in a white gown whirls past Tyler and
Jenny realize they’ve crashed a wedding reception

PARTY BARGE - THE BOW

Jenny and Tyler sit at a café table Tyler snags a BOTTLE OF

WINE and a couple of glasses from a neighboring table Pours
They gulp wine catching their breath Watching Rome slide by
in the balmy night A moment of surreal safety

Jenny swings her shoulder bag into her lap Pulls out the
BRONZE CYLINDER from the Vatican’s crypt

TYLER
What is that

JENNY
A cylinder seal Let’s see what it
has to tell us

She clears space on the white paper tablecloth POURS WINE
OVER THE BRONZE SEAL Rolls it on the tabletop It PRINTS A
PAGE OF BLOOD-RED CUNEIFORM on the white paper

Jenny studies the text - her eyes widening as she reads

TYLER
What is it

JENNY
A warning twenty-five centuries old
“We are the Rebel Temple We stand
watch lest the Dead King rise”

TYLER
The Dead King

JENNY
“Ashurbanipal Lord of Massacres
Conqueror of Egypt and Babylon”
(she reads for a moment)
It says he captured priests in Egypt
Learned their magic “He resolved to
descend to the Underworld steal the
power of the gods and rise again as
God-king over all the world”
(shaken)
That’s what the Archivist said He
would open the gates of Hell

They exchange grim looks

TYLER
Anything about how to stop that
from happening

JENNY
In fact yes “He lies in a secret
tomb sealed by mighty spells Its
walls must not be broken” Whoops
(perplexed by this)
“He is cased in a coffin that thirsts
for blood It must not drink”

Tyler turns his hand over to look at his scarred palm

TYLER
(tightly)
What else

JENNY
“If the Dead King rises he will
seek his crown and his sword For
in these relics he has invested
the greater part of his power”

The crown and sword are pictured Jenny pulls the bronze
circlet from her bag and lays it on the paper it matches

JENNY (CONTD)
“The crown upon the Dead King’s
brow will magnify his dominion
over the living and the dead the
earth and the sky The crown must
be denied him”

TYLER
Check

JENNY
“The sword in the Dead King’s hand
will shatter armies and strongholds”

TYLER
The sword must be denied him

JENNY
Right “When his power is made whole
he will go to his Necropolis and open
the Underworld Gate Loosing the host
of hell into the Upper World”

She and Tyler exchange grim looks
JENNY (CONTD)
There’s more I can’t read I’1l
have to make a better print But
Tyler This sword

She’s staring at the drawing on the scroll The distinctive
half-swept blade and guard She looks up eyes wide

JENNY (CONTD)
I know where this sword is

INT LORENZO’S CASTLE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
A bedroom worthy of the Medici court Lorenzo lies in bed in
his dressing gown reading the Marquis DeSade Two stunning

girls in lingerie on either side of him

His phone rings His eyebrows rise as he sees who’s calling
He answers purring - shooing the girls out of bed

LORENZO
Jenny Halsey I knew youd call

EXT ROME - PARTY BARGE - NIGHT (INTERCUT)
Jenny talks on the phone a finger in her other ear
JENNY

I’ve come into an artifact I think
you’d appreciate

You were never in the selling game

JENNY
I am tonight

Tyler looks around warily as Jenny talks He sees a black SUV
full of carabinieri Rome’s paramilitary police force roll
past on the riverbank He turns his back to them

JENNY (CONTD)
It has to be soon There’s some
heavy players in the market for
this piece Can you pick me up

LORENZO (VO)
What now Where are you

JENNY
Rome

Tyler fidgets with his hands his scar is burning He hears
the CAWING OF RAVENS Looks around

LORENZO (VO)
Ah So terrible the plane crash
Let me take you away from all that
One hour The usual place

Tyler gasps Ahead of the riverboat a bridge BLANKETED WITH
RAVENS As he watches THE MUMMY STEPS UP ONTO THE BALUSTRADE
- waiting for the current to bring the boat to him

Tyler vaults onto the boat’s topdeck Shoves the pilot aside
and WRENCHES THE WHEEL The riverboat heels over and CRUNCHES
into the bank The whole boat staggers and screams

Tyler leaps onto the bank Holds out his hands

TYLER
Jenny Come on

Belatedly seeing the danger she runs to the rail - as the
pilot rights the boat She leaps the widening gap between the
boat and the bank - and Tyler hauls her in They run

EXT BACK ALLEYS - TRACKING SHOT - NIGHT

Hand in hand Tyler and Jenny flee through a maze of streets

They duck down a narrow lane - but the shadows darken ahead
of them GHOST WHISPERS echo They dive around a corner

Dead ahead a black SUV disgorges carabinieri with submachine
guns Tyler and Jenny fade back into the shadows They sprint
down a side street Duck into an alley

A DARK MAN in a suit steps out of the shadows like a ghost
and SEIZES JENNY FROM BEHIND - a DAGGER at her throat With
his other hand he aims a gun over Jenny’s shoulder at Tyler

Tyler pulls his own gun A standoff

TYLER
Let her go or I’1l kill you

DARK MAN
Give me what you have stolen

JENNY
We haven’t stolen anything

DARK MAN
You lie You’re meddling in matters
beyond your understanding

TYLER
Tell me about it Drop the gun

His muscles are gathering for sudden action

DARK MAN
I’1l kill you both before I let you
keep the Dead King’s crown

His finger tightens on the trigger Tyler takes aim

TYLER
Pull that trigger and we’1l have the
police and worse on our backs

JENNY
Wait I’11 let you have it

She reaches into her bag Pulls out the crown - and HOOKS IT
BEHIND THE KNIFE AT HER THROAT protecting her neck

Tyler rushes in Kicks the gun out of the Dark Man’s grip
The Dark Man releases Jenny Comes at Tyler with the knife

Tyler deflects the slashing attack with his pistol Ducks
another wicked cut Gets inside and BREAKS THE DARK MAN’S
NOSE with a brutal punch The Dark Man drops out cold

Tyler takes his knife Jenny grabs the fallen gun They run
EXT MARINA - HELIPORT - DAYBREAK

A lavish marina where the Tiber River flows into the sea
Tyler and Jenny wait nervously at a HELIPORT at the water’s

edge The look around the marina is empty the coast clear
A distant helicopter draws closer their ride

Tyler pulls out the dagger he got from the Dark Man Inspects
it in the sunlight bronze hilt engraved blade of Damascus
steel Jenny takes it carefully from his hands

JENNY
This dagger’s a thousand years old

Carved into the pommel a FOUR-BARRED CROSS Jenny pulls the
cylinder seal from her bag It’s marked with the same cross

JENNY (CONTD)

The same symbol Who was he He knew

about the Dead King And the crown

TYLER

Let’s get to the sword Before

someone else does
A THUNDER OF ROTORS as Lorenzo’s helicopter comes in to land
AT THE WATER’S EDGE

A drainage tunnel opens on the waterway THE MUMMY LOOMS OUT
OF THE DARK Clambers up the bank to the Marina

INT HELICOPTER (ON THE HELIPAD)
The pilot Marco frowns over his shoulder as Tyler gets in

MARCO
Mr Montanari said one

JENNY
Turns out two

Marco shrugs and nods Jenny and Tyler settle in - oblivious
to THE DARK FIGURE LURCHING CLOSER outside the windows

EXT HELIPORT - CONTINUOUS

The helicopter lifts with a smooth surge of power The MUMMY
HURLS ITSELF OFF THE GROUND AND GRABS THE LANDING SKID

INT HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS
The helicopter swings under the added weight

MARCO
Che cavolo

He wrestles with the controls as they climb over the water

Jenny SCREAMS as her door is wrenched open The MUMMY reaches
inside CLAWS AT THE BAG on her shoulder It drags Jenny
halfway out the door a terrifying view of the water far
below The gun falls out of her bag into the sea

Tyler lunges across Jenny PLANTS THE ANCIENT DAGGER IN THE
MUMMY’S SHOULDER The Mummy SHRIEKS a hideous sound and
falls away crashing into the sea below with a huge splash

Jenny pulls her door shut as Marco gets the helicopter
leveled out He looks back at them in shock

MARCO (CONT’D)
Who was that

TYLER
We thought he was with you

UNDER THE SEA

The Mummy sinks to the bottom snarled in its black cassock
It pulls the dagger from its shoulder and lets it fall

Close by a HEAVY ANCHOR lies embedded in the sea floor The
Mummy claws its way to the anchor chain Climbs Breaking the
surface it looks up to see a rusty CARGO SHIP Crewmen
toiling on the deck

EXT GREEK COASTLINE - DAY

Atop rugged cliffs quaint white villages overlook a cobalt
sea Lorenzo’s helicopter soars over this sun-drenched vista

INT HELICOPTER (IN FLIGHT)

Jenny takes off her headset Signals Tyler to do likewise
They talk over the engine noise out of Marco’s hearing

JENNY
When we get to Lorenzo’s - follow
my lead I’m on thin ice with the
guy already He’s dangerous

TYLER
Dangerous how

JENNY
He’s got a mountain of money an army
of bodyguards and some very shady
friends out of Sicily and Corsica

TYLER
What’s he to you Boyfriend

JENNY
Client

TYLER
Forster said you worked the black
market I thought he was lying

JENNY
(exploding in exasperation)
I do NOT I authenticate and
restore antiquities for private
buyers I do good work

TYLER
For bad people

JENNY
I document relics that would
otherwise vanish from the
historical record

TYLER
For a big fat fee

In a huff Jenny puts her headset back on cutting off the
conversation Tyler grins to have gotten under her skin

EXT - LORENZO’S ISLAND - TERRACE

Impeccably dressed Lorenzo Montanari watches the helicopter
touches down BODYGUARDS flank him He smiles as Jenny steps
out Then Tyler gets out A shadow crosses his face

Jenny comes to him They trade kisses on the cheek

LORENZO
You brought a man with you How
unfortunate

JENNY
Tyler Colt He’s a colleague

LORENZO
Is he What are you wearing

They’re still in the clothes they wore in the tomb

JENNY
It’s a long story Which you kind
of need to hear

LORENZO
I love stories Tomas Find them
something to wear

JENNY
Lorenzo This is urgent

LORENZO
So is breakfast And no one sits at
my table dressed like that

HALLWAY

Tyler and Jenny follow Lorenzos butler Tomas through the
castle They converse in undertones

TYLER
So what’s the plan

JENNY
We try to make a deal for the sword

TYLER
And if he won’t deal

JENNY
We try the truth

INT DINING ROOM - DAY

A dazzling sun room Panoramic views of the Mediterranean
Lorenzo stands waiting Bodyguards against the walls

Tomas brings Tyler and Jenny in transformed Tyler wears a
linen shirt and jacket Jenny a clingy sun dress They both
look ravishing - and it’s not lost on either one of them

The table is laid with a breakfast suitable for royalty Dish
after dish Eggs roasted meats fruit pastries Flowers

TYLER
Special occasion

LORENZO
Breakfast is always a special
occasion I love breakfast

They sit Jenny and Tyler realize how long it’s been since
they ate They dig in Servers pour coffee juice champagne

As they eat a man with a face like a hatchet blade enters
behind them VITTORIO He looks Tyler and Jenny over Catches
Lorenzo’s eye nods at Tyler and PANTOMIMES A GUN HIDDEN
UNDER THE JACKET Lorenzo nods minimally Vittorio sits down

LORENZO (CONTD)
Vittorio my head of security
You know Dr Halsey This is Tyler
Colt Her colleague
Vittorio makes no move to eat or drink His voice is icy

VITTORIO
Are you also an archaeologist

Tyler hesitates his mouth full

JENNY
He is

Tyler blinks I am Lorenzo smiles enjoying this game
He saws a bloody steak and eggs to ribbons as he talks

LORENZO
I’m fascinated by the ancient world
Jenny could tell you The blend of
civilization and savagery Babylon
Assyria They didn’t defeat enemies
They annihilated them Razed cities
to the ground Poisoned the wells
Salted the earth Defeat was a
holocaust My question to you Mr
Colt how was it possible The
Assyrians were human How could they
perpetrate such atrocities

Jenny leans in to cover for him But Tyler washes his food
down with a slug of champagne and gets there first

TYLER
The king He was first into battle
Rode off the field red with blood
When he took prisoners the king did
the torture and the execution with
his own hands Once the king did
evil the people followed

LORENZO
(surprised and impressed)
Pleasure to meet a fellow scholar

Jenny seizes the opportunity to get them back on mission

JENNY
Perhaps you’d show him your
collection

LIBRARY

Lorenzo walks Jenny and Tyler through his private museum
Vittorio trails them making Tyler nervous

LORENZO
Scythian spearElamite helmet
that sword is Assyrian Probably
worn by a king or prince Look at
the workmanship

Jenny elbows Tyler subtly nodding at the sword Thats it
Tyler takes it in a bronze-hilted sword The steel blade is
straight near the hilt then curves to a swept point It
hangs in a thick glass case

LORENZO (CONTD)
Folded like Damascus steel centuries
before its time But to business You
have a story for me no

They gather around a table Jenny pulls the CYLINDER SEAL out
of her bag Lorenzo inspects it reverently

LORENZO (CONTD)
Where did you get this

MINUTES LATER

Lorenzo rolls the cylinder seal across a slab of soft clay
It prints its message with a sculptural beauty only hinted at
in Jennys paper version He reads the text intently

LORENZO (CONTD)
Incredible Assyrian myths fixate
on the Underworld Ishtar descended
and came back And Gilgamesh But
to claim a king of Assyria would
rise from the dead

He bends over to read the bottom of the print - the section
that was too indistinct to read in Jenny’s version

LORENZO (CONTD)
“Should the Dead King rise seek
the Rebel Temple in Byzantium and
they will rise against him”
(in wonder)
The Rebel Temple Could it be the
same one after two thousand years

JENNY
Youve heard of it

Amazed by this revelation Jenny and Tyler don’t notice
Lorenzo’s BODYGUARDS moving into the room behind them

LORENZO
Shadowy group in Istanbul Supposed
to be holy warriors like the Knights
Templar but older Very secretive
very rich They buy up the best
relics Mystical artifacts You
think you’re the high bidder then
BOOM the Rebel Temple swoops in If
you played the black market you’d
know the name

His tone hardens as he turns on Jenny TYLER CLOCKS THE MEN
AROUND THEM He comes to high alert something’s up

LORENZO (CONTD)
But you do play the market don’t
you Selling stolen goods - like
the Eye of Alexander

He grabs Jenny by the throat

Tyler goes for his gun Vittorio grabs his arm from behind
With his other hand Tyler snatches the CYLINDER SEAL off the
table BRAINS VITTORIO Spins and BASHES LORENZO IN THE FACE

Lorenzo staggers back Tyler brings his gun up - and freezes
He STANDS IN A RING OF GUNMEN pistols aimed at his head

Lorenzo steps back to Tyler a red weal of CUNEIFORM printed
across his cheek He takes the gun from Tyler’s hand

LORENZO (CONTD)
Not in my house

He belts Tyler in the head with the gun Tyler goes down
LIBRARY - LATER

Tyler sits handcuffed to a chair a welt on his cheekbone
An IRON BREASTPLATE has been cinched to him heavy chains
encircling his ribcage A handwheel juts from the front

Jenny sits in another chair unbound but helpless Lorenzo
looms in her face Brandishes the Eye of Alexander

LORENZO
The Eye Designed by Aristotle for
Alexander the Great

He hurls it to the floor glass gems shattering

LORENZO (CONTD)
Fake I spent years tracking it
down I paid millions And you took
it from me Planted this forgery in
my collection Didn’t you

He SAVAGELY TWISTS THE HANDWHEEL ON TYLER’S BREASTPLATE The
chains ratchet tighter digging cruelly into his flesh and
forcing a pained wheeze out of Tyler’s lungs

JENNY
Yes I took it

Lorenzo smiles at Tyler

LORENZO
The Traitor’s Waistcoat Used by
Torquemada himself torturing
heretics in Seville Unique piece
(MORE)

LORENZO (CONTD)
See if you can keep breathing long
enough for your ribcage to let go

He turns his glare on Jenny

LORENZO (CONTD)
I don’t know what price you got for
the Eye but I’1ll get it all back
In dollars -
(eyeing her lewdly)
- or some other currency No one
takes whats mine

JENNY
It was stolen I took it back
It’s safe in the Jordan Museum

Lorenzo looms over Jenny

LORENZO
I doubt that I have sources in Rome
I’ve heard about you and Mr Colt
You plundered a tomb in Iraq Robbed
the Vatican Left a trail of bodies
across Rome You’re the most wanted
criminals in Europe

He runs a fingertip down her throat

LORENZO (CONTD)
Which means I can do whatever I
like with you

Tyler’s voice is a strangled whisper

TYLER
Lorenzo I swear to God

Lorenzo spins and CRANKS the handwheel hard silencing him

JENNY
Please don’t turn it any more

LORENZO
I thought you were an innocent
abroad I was taking my time with
you And all the while you were
deep in the game

He reaches into Jenny’s bag Pulls out Ashurbanipal’s crown
LORENZO (CONTD)

This is from that Iraqi tomb isn’t
it Where’s the rest

Tyler begins to LAUGH - a painfully thin airless sound
Lorenzo stares at him in astonished fury

LORENZO (CONTD)
What’s funny Mr Colt

TYLER
(a hoarse whisper)
He’s here

We follow the line of his gaze out the window over the ocean
A DARK UNNATURAL STORM bears down on the island RAVENS
WHEEL above a CARGO SHIP cutting through the turbulent sea

EXT CARGO SHIP - DAY

We fly across a deck littered with dead crewmen Drained of
blood and contorted in postures of horror eyes staring

On the bridge the PILOT stands at the helm stiff as a
zombie eyes rolled back Muttering in ancient Akkadian

At the bow of the ship stands a broad-shouldered figure

It is the Mummy - TRANSFORMED He has drunk the lives of
dozens He still wears his tattered priest’s cassock His
skin still black as night and ravaged by fine wrinkles

But his body is FLESHED OUT and POWERFUL muscular shoulders

straining the cassock’s seams His face no longer lipless and
skeletal but the IMPERIOUS VISAGE OF A RISEN KING - staring

through the wind at his destination

INT LORENZO’S CASTLE - LIBRARY
Lorenzo scowls at the inbound ship

LORENZO
Who the hell is that

JENNY
Lorenzo The story on the Seal is
true Ashurbanipal has risen You’re
holding his crown His sword hangs in
your library He’s coming for them

Lorenzo stares at her confounded He’s not buying it but
the urgency in her voice is real There has to be an angle

LORENZO
I don’t know who’s on that ship but
I own this island and every soul on
it No one lands without my word

He hands his pistol to Marco the young pilot

LORENZO (CONTD)
Marco Watch them Vittorio With me

He strides out - Vittorio and the other guards on his heels
Marco holding a gun on Tyler and Jenny glances nervously
out the window at the approaching ship He cocks the gun

GREAT HALL

The grand entryway of the castle With swift efficiency
Vittorio hands out automatic rifles to the guards

Lorenzo takes a rifle Realizes he’s still holding the crown
He perches the crown on a marble bust of Socrates

LORENZO
Sound the bell

EXT LORENZO’S ISLAND - MONTAGE

Ominous clouds gather above the island A BELL TOLLS in the
castle A signal danger from the sea

VILLAGERS RUSH OUT of houses with rifles and shotguns They
stand post in the streets Gather at the harbor

EXT CASTLE BATTLEMENTS

From atop the walls Lorenzo watches the villagers muster in
the island’s defense Beside him Vittorio and his guards
Lorenzo frowns at the incoming ship It’s not slowing down
EXT CARGO SHIP - BOW

With the jagged pipe in his left wrist the Mummy SLASHES HIS
RIGHT PALM Dark BLOOD wells forth He extends his hand and
CLENCHES HIS FIST Blood spatters into the sea

EXT LORENZO’S ISLAND

Above the castle THE STORMCLOUDS TAKE ON THE FORM OF A VAST
DARK HAND THE FIST CLOSES A RAIN OF BLOOD BEGINS TO FALL

Red droplets streak the whitewashed walls The horrified
faces of the villagers A great WAIL OF TERROR goes up The
islanders break and run in superstitious dread Vanishing
into their houses Barring doors and shuttering windows

In a stroke Lorenzo’s defenses are undone

The rain swells to a downpour painting the village crimson
Red torrents run down the streets to the sea

CASTLE BATTLEMENTS

Lorenzo stares in shock heedless of the unnatural rain that
drenches him Vittorio and the guards flee into the castle

HARBOR

The cargo ship comes in at full speed - SMASHING the little
fishing fleet at anchor and CRUSHING the wooden docks

The Mummy LEAPS FROM THE BOW onto the buckled timbers Walks
past Lorenzo’s yacht the Libertine now drenched with blood

INT LORENZO’S CASTLE - LIBRARY

Marco stands at the window gawking at the events outside
His gun hand falls to his side

Tyler catches Jenny’s eye Nods at Marco and mouths NOW
She stares at him Mouths back NO Tyler nods Mouths Now

Jenny goes for it Tackling Marco against the window and
clutching the gun Marco swings her around like a terrier

Tyler rises The chair on his back the breastplate still
crushing his ribs He charges into the fray They all go down
- Tyler on his face with a grunt of pain The gun spins away

EXT VILLAGE STREET

The Mummy walks up toward the castle through the rain of
blood A dark cloaked figure Unchallenged and unopposed

INT LORENZO’S CASTLE - LIBRARY
Jenny and Marco grapple on the floor for the gun

Tyler struggles back to his feet chair still shackled to his
back Waddles over to Marco and kicks him into submission
Sits the chair down with its foot-rail across Marco’s throat

Jenny gets up holding Marco’s gun She rushes to Tyler Pulls
the LATCH on the Traitor’s Waistcoat The breastplate falls
away - leaving dotted lines of blood on his white shirt where
the links have broken the skin Tyler gasps in relief

TYLER
Thank you

But he’s still handcuffed to the chair Jenny goes around
behind him Points the gun at Tyler’s wrists Marco trapped
under the chair finds himself staring up the gunbarrel

JENNY
I could shoot the chain

TYLER MARCO
Do not pull that trigger I have a key I have a key

GREAT HALL - FRONT DOORS

Lorenzo Vittorio and six guards line up inside the wide
double doors rifles raised They watch the SECURITY MONITOR
beside the entry it shows the courtyard outside

As they watch a GHOSTLY CLOUD OF STATIC crosses the monitor
A glitch the right size and shape to conceal a man

EXT LORENZO’S CASTLE - COURTYARD
The Mummy stands outside the front doors

He crouches Plucks a STRUGGLING SPIDER off the ground in a
pinch of dust He places the spider earth and all on his
dry black tongue and swallows it

INT GREAT HALL - FRONT DOORS

EVERY MAN BUT LORENZO is suddenly DOUBLED OVER WITH SICKNESS
They drop their guns and fall to their knees retching

Vittorio begins to VOMIT SPIDERS THE SIZE OF TARANTULAS
Another man follows suit Three men heave up LIVING SERPENTS
in writhing black masses Two more SCORPIONS

The sick men are SET UPON BY THE CREATURES THEYVE JUST
DISGORGED They howl and drum their heels as bite and sting
send the poison home In seconds they lie dead

Lorenzo backs away firing his machine gun haphazardly at the
creepy-crawlies on the floor

CRASH The front doors fly open as if blasted by a cannon
The Mummy walks into the great hall He approaches Lorenzo
his hand outstretched whispering in Akkadian

By the time he reaches Lorenzo Lorenzo is whispering in
unison his eyelids fluttering Enslaved

THE MUMMY
(in Akkadian subtitled)
Are you the prince of this house

LORENZO
(in Italian subtitled)
I am my Lord

THE MUMMY
(in Akkadian subtitled)
Serve me Bring me my crown

Lorenzo turns like a puppet the crown sits on the bust of
Socrates a few paces away He fetches the Crown The Mummy
takes it solemnly PLACES IT ON HIS HEAD

VAST POWER SURGES INTO HIM The wind of it ripping at his

cassock When the transfer is complete his EYES HAVE CHANGED
No longer a hard glittering black they have gray whites and
inky irises Not quite human - but no longer altogether dead

He is more than the Mummy now He is ASHURBANIPAL Lord of
Massacres King of Assyria risen again

A distant GUNSHOT rings out turning Ashurbanipal’s head Two
shots Three He walks toward the sound Lorenzo follows

LIBRARY

Tyler stands before Ashurbanipal’s sword Marco’s gun in his
hand Three bulletholes in the thick glass He kicks through
the case Grabs the sword

WHISPERING VOICES Tyler and Jenny look at each other

TYLER
We gotta go

EXT LORENZO’S CASTLE - TERRACE

The helicopter sits where they left it windows streaked with
blood The rain has stopped but the sky is heavy with cloud

INT HELICOPTER
Tyler sits in the pilot’s seat Jenny climbs in beside him

JENNY
Youre a pilot

TYLER
Uh sometimes on missions they let
me sit second seat on the way home

JENNY
Oh My God

Tyler studies the instrument panel Gets the engine started
Gets the rotor turning Throttles up The helicopter lifts
unsteadily Spins once and drops hard to the deck

Jenny watches the castle anxiously

JENNY (CONTD)
Why are we not flying

TYLER
Give me a minute This isfancy

He tries again The helicopter lifts
EXT LORENZO’S CASTLE - TERRACE

Barely airborne the helicopter slides over the cliff’s edge
and drops out of sight Moments later it reappears in
controlled flight escaping over the sea

Ashurbanipal slams out onto the terrace Strides to the
railing watching the helicopter dwindling in the distance

Lorenzo stops behind him - terrified but unable to disobey

LORENZO
They have your sword

INT HELICOPTER (IN FLIGHT) - DAY

The helicopter reaches cruising speed high over the waves
The castle far behind them Tyler and Jenny breathe easier

She turns the cylinder seal in her hands Staring at the four-
barred cross stamped on each end

JENNY
The Rebel Temple still exists And
this is their symbol That means
the man in Rome was one of them

TYLER
Why would he try to kill us

JENNY
We dug up the Dead King Set him
free From their point of view we’re
the bad guys We have to find them
Convince them we’re on the same side
They’re the only ones who can help

EXT LORENZO’S CASTLE - TERRACE

Ashurbanipal stares at the horizon - brow furrowed under his
crown A RUMBLE as he gathers power He raises his hands
clawing at the air - and SLAMS A FIST DOWN ON THE MARBLE
BANNISTER The marble CRACKS under his hand

On the horizon LIGHTNING STRIKES - the branching bolt like a
SKELETAL HAND CLAWING OUT OF THE STORM

Ashurbanipal’s fist falls again And again With every blow
THE HEAVENS TEAR OPEN far away Distant thunder rolls

INT HELICOPTER (IN FLIGHT) - DAY

Tyler flies east along the Greek coastline - toward Turkey
and Istanbul

A BLINDING LIGHTNING STRIKE right in front of them So close
the thunder is simultaneous Jenny SCREAMS

Another bolt Closer still

Tyler DIVES toward the sea bleeding off altitude and seeking
safety He levels off forty feet above the waves just
offshore The bolts come faster and faster He veers wildly

KA-TOW The chopper is struck

The instruments burn out The motor dies Auto-rotating the
helicopter plunges into the sea

EXT LORENZO’S CASTLE - TERRACE
Ashurbanipal turns away from the railing satisfied For the
first time he notices the LINE OF CUNEIFORM printed on
Lorenzo’s cheek where Tyler hit him with the cylinder seal
He reaches out and turns Lorenzo’s chin Reading
ASHURBANIPAL
(in Akkadian subtitled)
Seek the Rebel Temple in Byzantium
Ashurbanipal smiles

EXT GREEK COASTLINE - OFFSHORE

Tyler breaks the surface beside Jenny gasping for air He
holds up the sword They swim for the beach

EXT GREEK COASTAL HIGHWAY

Jenny stands on the shoulder going through her bag Dead
tablet computer Sodden notebook

Tyler stands with Ashurbanipal’s sword wrapped in his jacket
Hitchhiking in his bloodied shirt Jenny sees what poor luck
he’s having She hikes up her skirt Sticks out her thumb

A FREIGHT TRUCK squeals to a stop beside them

INT FREIGHT TRUCK (IN MOTION) - DAY

In the back of the truck Tyler and Jenny lean on sacks of
rice exhausted The highway hums under the tires She gently

prods his abused ribcage He winces

JENNY
No broken ribs

TYLER
(grinning wearily)
That was nothing I’ve had worse

She laughs falling back against the rice sacks

JENNY
Very upbeat for someone so beat up

TYLER
I’ve been lost for a long time
I guess being on the run with you
feels better than being lost

Without intending to he’s just said exactly the right thing
Jenny turns into him emotion in her eyes

Tyler starts to snore Jenny laughs Tucks herself under his
arm Closes her eyes

UNDERWORLD - SEA OF FIRE

A vast ocean of fire under a smoky blood-red sky Black
islands and pinnacles of stone rise from the flaming sea

The Dead King is crossing the flames Leaping precariously
from spire to spire In the distance his goal a luminous
WHITE PALACE on a craggy peak above the fire

Below him the sea of fire tosses and heaves like liquid It
recedes suddenly revealing the sea floor - a solid mass of

pale bodies writhing and howling for mercy - then rises like
a wave washing up the rocky spire to engulf the Dead King -

INT FREIGHT TRUCK (IN MOTION)

Tyler slams awake gasping Reflexively Jenny throws her arms
around him calming him She studies him as he gets a grip

JENNY
Tell me about the nightmares

TYLER
I see the Dead King I am the Dead
King And I’m in Hell

JENNY
Keep talking

INT LORENZO’S CASTLE - BEDROOM

Ashurbanipal stands at a mirror Drops his cassock Studies
his powerful body His withered skin Lorenzo beside him

Like a man trimming his fingernails Ashurbanipal begins to
PULL THE BROKEN BRONZE TUBES FROM HIS FLESH He hands them to
a horrified Lorenzo as he talks He speaks in Akkadian
spellbound Lorenzo understands him We hear English

ASHURBANIPAL
Twenty-five centuries in Hell I saw
the Upper World through the
nightmares of the living Empires
rising and falling Machines crawling
over the land Flying in the sky The
curse of Babylon eating up the world

LORENZO
Babylon fell two thousand years ago

ASHURBANIPAL
It has fallen many times It always
rises again

He waves at the world around them Loathing in his voice

ASHURBANIPAL (CONT’D)
This is all Babylon

Jenny and Tyler sit facing one another She’s looking over
notes she’s made in her damp notebook

JENNY
The places in your nightmares I’ve
read about them They’re landmarks

the Blind The Black Tower The
Endless Stair The Sea of Fire

TYLER
Seriously

JENNY
And across the Sea of Fire - the

Tyler leans close and speaks to the camera

TYLER

has his crown WE have his sword

He holds the sword up to the camera Dayan stares like he’s
seen a ghost The screen goes dark

TYLER (CONTD)
Hopefully we’ll get a few words in
before they kill us

DOORS BURST OPEN at the back of the lobby A phalanx of grim
dark-suited men stride toward the front doors One of them is
the Dark Man from Rome a bandage across his broken nose

TYLER (CONTD)
Maybe not

The leader MALIK 35 - slim dapper and handsome - wrenches
the door open angrily Tyler holds up a soothing hand

TYLER (CONT’D)

Malik takes a hissing breath Seizes Tyler’s wrist staring
at the scar on his palm He has an Oxford accent this is the
Mysterious Man we saw on the phone at the top of the film

MALIK
Blood of the Chosen

INT REBEL TEMPLE - GRAND HALL

Malik walks Tyler and Jenny into a stunning marble hall with
elegant lighting Priceless relics on display in glass cases

Two dozen BROTHERS OF THE REBEL TEMPLE surround them They
wear bespoke suits with exquisitely patterned ties Manicured
hands Immaculate haircuts It looks more like a boutique
investment bank than a mystical order

TYLER
(aside to Jenny)
Not what I expected
She shakes her head looking around Me neither

Malik turns to them righteous and stern

MALIK
Your names

TYLER
Tyler Colt This is Jennifer Halsey

MALIK

on Scythian magic was very good

JENNY

Thank you

She looks around in wonder at the antiquities on display

You have pieces here I’ve spent
years searching for Nefertiti’s
Scepter The Chalice of Antioch

Quick as cats the Temple Brothers whip WEAPONS from under
their coats Tyler and Jenny find themselves the center of a
quivering ring of knives swords and pistols
Verrrry slowly she pulls out the cylinder seal
JENNY (CONTD)
The Vatican Archivist gave us this

Your message We hoped you’d help

MALIK
You raised the Dead King

TYLER
He raised himself We’re trying to
put him back in the ground
Malik takes their measure with his eyes He believes them
MALIK
I am Malik Leader of the Temple
These are my brothers The sword

He holds out a hand imperiously Tyler gives him the blade

MALIK (CONTD)
Belbasa See to it

BELBASA 70 steps forward gray-haired but hale a keen
glint of intelligence in his kindly eyes

BELBASA
At once

He carries the sword away

MALIK
Where is the Dead King now

TYLER
This morningan island off the
Greek coast But he’ll be coming

MALIK
Yes He will follow the sword It
calls him But don’t be afraid Our
defenses are strong

JENNY
What is this place The Rebel Temple
Who are you

INT REBEL TEMPLE - HALL OF REMEMBRANCE - DAY

Malik leads Tyler and Jenny to an exhibit hall Stone tablets
and bas-relief sculptures tell the Rebel Temple’s story

MALIK
Our forefathers were Egyptian
priests When Ashurbanipal invaded
Egypt he enslaved them and took
them back to Assyria

Sweat rises on Tyler’s brow as he listens Somehow he knows
this story He has FLASHES OF A WAKING DREAM as Malik talks

PRIESTS cross the desert in chains driven by ASSYRIAN
WARRIORS with whips and spears

MALIK (CONTD)
Ashurbanipal was obsessed with the
Underworld He made the priests
teach him all they knew How to
defend himself from demons Steal
power from the gods They knew it
was wrong - but they were slaves
And the price of defiance was too
hideous to bear

In a cavern chained priests writhe and howl under torture

MALIK (CONTD)
For years they toiled in bondage
building a great Necropolis And
inside the Necropolis a portal
A mystic engine that would open the
gates of the Underworld

Tyler sees it In a vast stone hall a mandala of gold cut
into the floor Intricate clockwork exposed beneath it

MALIK (CONTD)
When the king was mortally wounded
in battle his plan was set in
motion The priests allowed him to
die - but wove spells of protection
around him Spells of return

The dying Ashurbanipal is horribly embalmed alive The iron
sarcophagus with its impaling pipes closes over his body

Jenny sees Tyler’s distress Lays a hand on his shoulder He
shakes off the vision blinking the images away

Malik walks them past a series of BRONZE PANELS depicting a
descent to the Underworld

MALIK (CONTD)
The king meant to bargain with the
Lord of the Underworld he would open
the gates of hell turning the powers
of darkness loose upon the Upper
World And in exchange Ashurbanipal
would live again An immortal god-
king To rule the world

Tyler and Jenny stare at the Underworld images The demons of
Assyrian hell are hideous creatures Deformed men skeletal
ghouls monsters with the heads of hawks or lions

MALIK (CONTD)
Only when Ashurbanipal lay in his
tomb did the priests find the courage
to defy him They revealed his plans
to his son who had taken the throne
He liked being king He didn’t want
his father back any more than they
did So he buried the Necropolis and
hid the Dead King’s body in the
desert Not even our forefathers knew
where For centuries we paid the
tribal warlords to guard the great
desert Until now that was enough

Malik spreads his arms Bringing the story home

MALIK (CONTD)
After twenty years in the Assyrian
court our forefathers could not
return to Egypt So they came to
Byzantium and founded the Rebel
Temple Here we’ve kept watch for
twenty-five centuries that the
evil our forefathers created might
never again darken the waking day

OCULUS CENTER

A cutting-edge database facility Rows of humming servers
Walls of flat-panel displays Dayan sits at the terminal

this is his domain Malik Tyler and Jenny stand watching

DAYAN
We track relics Artifacts People
with certain gifts Mystical sites
Anything beyond the ordinary

ONSCREEN Dayan flies across a map of the world sparkling
with markers for people Artifacts Places haunted and holy
It’s an occult Google Earth running on next-gen technology

Tyler and Jenny trade impressed looks

TYLER
Heard of the Special Weapons Group

MALIK
(amused)
The Pentagon’s little band of
dabblers

TYLER
Do they have something like this

MALIK
How they wish

INFIRMARY

A strange combination of modern medical clinic and
alchemist’s laboratory Science and sorcery side by side

Tyler and Jenny sit on benches with their shirts off The
symbols on their skin faded almost to invisibility Tyler’s
ribs marked with bruised prints of Lorenzo’s torture chains

The wise old man Belbasa fusses around them He’s assisted
by the Dark Man with the broken nose His name is RABBU He
glowers darkly at Tyler who watches him nervously

BELBASA
Rabbu See to his injuries

Rabbu cleans and bandages Tyler’s ribs with deliberate
roughness A tiny revenge Tyler winces and toughs it out

Belbasa opens a wooden chest fumbling through mystic
paraphernalia He peers at the faded symbols on their skins

BELBASA (CONTD)
You did well with these But mine
are better

He produces a collection of METAL INK STAMPS bigger than the
palms of his hands He stamps intricate protective mandalas
on their shoulders chests and backs in black and red ink

BELBASA (CONTD)
These will keep the Evil One out of
your minds and bodies But even these
barriers can be broken If the spirit
is weak If he gets too close

JENNY
What about you

BELBASA
Rabbu Show her

Rabbu grins and hikes up his shirt His powerful torso is
BLANKETED WITH MYSTIC TATTOOS

RABBU
Ours are permanent

Belbasa takes Tyler’s hand Examines the wound in his palm

BELBASA
Does this hurt you

TYLER
Only when he’s nearby

BELBASA
Youre bound to him by blood magic
That’s why you dream his dreams He
chose you as he lay in his coffin
you were strongest It will help
you find him Pray God it will help
you kill him

TEMPLE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

Belbasa leads Jenny in She wears borrowed clothes a man’s
shirt and trousers belted tight at her slim waist

The library holds codexes papyruses tablets and scrolls
Half a dozen Temple brothers pore over the records

JENNY
What are they looking for

BELBASA
Words of power Protective magic
Anything to fight the Dead King

JENNY
They look frightened

BELBASA
After two thousand years what man
believes this day will come in his
lifetime No one was ready

In back rides Ashurbanipal crowned and dressed as a king
might dress himself from Lorenzo’s closet black silk pajamas
and slippers a dark dressing gown belted at the waist

EXT ISTANBUL AVENUE - (CONTINUOUS )

We rise above the Rolls Royce as it moves down the avenue
Misfortune and mayhem travel with it like an invisible wave

As the car passes - two lovers walking hand in hand begin to
fight viciously A man walking two mastiffs is attacked by

his dogs A policeman hurrying to rescue him fumbles his gun
it goes off when it hits the ground - killing the policeman

The Dead King smiles The car rolls on Chaos in its wake
INT REBEL TEMPLE - GALLERY
Rabbu and Tyler walk through a gallery overlooking the city

TYLER
Sorry about the nose

RABBU
It’s nothing I’m sorry we fought If
we had spoken we might still have
the crown But we have the sword -
and here it’s safe There’s a holy
seal on every brick in the Temple
Every girder tile and window

He touches the window in front of them an intricate RUNE
ENGRAVED IN THE GLASS

RABBU (CONTD)
This will stop the Devil himself

TYLER
Will it stop a brick

RABBU
If we come under physical assault
we take refuge in the Stronghold
Beneath the Temple The fortress of
our forefathers They were frightened
men they dug deep and built strong

TYLER
Okay Defense is half the battle
talk to me about fighting back

TEMPLE ARMORY

A steel-walled hypermodern room Racks and shelves hold a
strange mix of ancient and contemporary weapons VIALS OF
WHITE POWDER beside FRAGMENTATION GRENADES Sleek KEVLAR
VESTS beside MYSTICAL MEDALLIONS

Rabbu pulls out a rolling rack filled with SWORDS Tyler
picks up a broadsword Damascus steel carved with Aramaic
script and mystic symbols

RABBU
Consecrated blades Demons can’t be
hurt by common steel These will
cut - and kill

Tyler swings the sword in a swift figure-eight testing the
balance Thrusts and returns gracefully to guard

RABBU (CONT’D)
You’re a swordsman

TYLER
Not really Trained a little

MALIK
Ashurbanipal is trapped in his own
dead flesh He is in constant pain
Full of suffering and vengeance He
will stop at nothing to live again

Jenny nods shaken She believes She takes Tyler’s hand

MALIK (CONTD)
Long ago priests of our order gave
him the power to open the gates of
hell Now it falls to us to stop him
(grimly)
It won’t be easy The King has his
crown It will magnify his power

There’s no time to call them home
But we are twenty-five swords

JENNY

MALIK
So be it We are enough The final
battle will be here In our Temple
The Dead King will come For this

He holds up Ashurbanipal’s sword with its hilt of bronze

MALIK (CONTD)
And we will destroy him

He turns taking stock of their resolve As he steps aside -
A DARK FIGURE IS REVEALED ON THE ROOFTOP ACROSS THE STREET
Tyler sees him first Exploding to his feet

TYLER
THERE

EXT THE OPPOSITE ROOFTOP

Ashurbanipal takes a deep breath BLOWS BETWEEN PURSED LIPS
A GREAT WIND RISES blasting through the city

The winds twist into A CYCLONE AROUND THE REBEL TEMPLE

inside the massive door guns and swords at the ready

Tyler squeezes Jennys shoulder

TYLER

He takes his place beside Malik Waiting for the Dead King
EXT ON THE OPPOSITE ROOFTOP

Ashurbanipal stands facing the ruined Rebel Temple At his
back lies the BOSPORUS - the mighty waterway separating
Europe and Asia - spanned by magnificent suspension bridges

Ashurbanipal punches a fist into the air

A COLOSSAL COLUMN OF WATER ERUPTS out of the Bosporus -
towering over Istanbul like the fist of an angry god

He smashes his fist down

The column of water lashes over the city and descends on the
Rebel Temple like a focused tidal wave The battering waters
funnel into the whirlwind A WATERSPOUT ENGULFS THE BUILDING

INT REBEL TEMPLE - STRONGHOLD
A ROAR LIKE THUNDER The defenders exchange mystified looks

FLOODING THE UNDERGROUND CHAMBER Water jets in through seams

and lifts him up Tyler unbolts the grate Swings it back

Tyler takes her in his arms She looks up the dark shaft

Right behind you

Jenny nods fiercely Climbs into the shaft

climbs into the shaft below her pushing her higher

At the top of the shaft she finds a THICK METAL GRATE locked
from the inside She strains at the bolts Shoots them back

A windowless hall of Egyptian artifacts treasures of gold
and alabaster A burial mask as grand as Tutankhamen’s
Statues of stone A towering OBELISK

A METAL GRATE in the floor swings open Jenny’s arm reaches
out holding Ashurbanipal’s sword Her head rises into view

She finds herself staring at TWO BLACK-SLIPPERED FEET

Jenny looks up and SCREAMS Ashurbanipal seizes her by the
arm and hauls her out of the shaft

He ducks back into the shaft The massive obelisk slams down
atop him - sealing the shaft irrevocably

open and swims up through it Behind him Rabbu shoves one
brother after another up through the hatch

Suddenly A TRANCE STATE OVERCOMES THE DRIVERS IN THEIR CARS

Traffic parts before it like a wave

SMASHING INTO THE MASERATI from both sides

EXT BOSPORUS BRIDGE - DAY

Istanbul’s mighty suspension bridge A hundred feet wide A
mile long Two hundred feet above the water

influence drivers sit spellbound at both ends of the span

together violently behind it barricading the entrance

INT ROLLS ROYCE (IN MOTION)

his breath The air darkens around him as he rouses his

power CRUMBLING CORROSION spreads across the roadbed

He CHOPS DOWNWARD The magical blade bites deep A JAGGED
FISSURE RUNS ACROSS THE DECK from edge to edge

RUNNING ONTO THE BRIDGE

Tyler and Malik stumble as the road bucks beneath their feet
A titanic GROAN OF METAL

AT THE CENTER OF THE BRIDGE
Ashurbanipal walks to the left side of the bridge - where the
main cable descends closest to the deck In one leaping blow

HE CUTS THROUGH THE TWO-FOOT-THICK STEEL CABLE

The BRIDGE DECK BREAKS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SPAN
Ashurbanipal’s side of the bridge SAGS TOWARD THE WATER

RUNNING ONTO THE BRIDGE

Tyler and Malik find themselves running down as the bridge
drops beneath them

She chooses a dress - a white goddess number that shows more
skin than she’d like Ashurbanipal shows no sign of leaving
Reluctantly she unbuttons her shirt and takes it off

Breath hisses through the Dead King’s teeth as he sees the
protective mandalas printed on her skin

MILITARY TRUCK tumbling across the compound in flames

Ashurbanipal walks through the smoke The TANK a Russian T-
90 rumbles to meet him lowering its main gun to engage him

Ashurbanipal SLASHES two-foot sections off the descending
gunbarrel What’s left of the gun lowers far enough to aim at
him The Dead King STABS HIS BLADE INTO THE TANK’S HULL
INSIDE THE TANK

The DRIVER screams as the sword blade thrusts through the
thick armor and stops an inch from his face

ON ASHURBANIPAL

As he heaves upward The entire tank FLIPS END OVER END - the
main gun firing too late mid-air - and lands upside-down

A VOLLEY OF BULLETS stitches across Ashurbanipal’s body as a
gun turret opens fire on him He clenches his fist

Hurls it as if throwing an invisible stone The gunners
scream and cover their eyes blood seeping between their
fingers Blind

More solders join the fight aiming an annoying number of
guns at the Dead King Enough games He thrusts his sword
into the earth muttering in Akkadian Spreads his fingers
and drives his hands outward as if toppling walls

All over the base soldiers COLLAPSE like marionettes whose
strings have been cut Silence falls

Ashurbanipal beckons Jenny and Lorenzo get out of the
limousine and walk into the base following Ashurbanipal
toward the yawning mouth of an ancient cave

INT MERCENARY HELICOPTER (IN FLIGHT)
Tyler stares down at the Mosul Army Base on approach The
overturned truck and tank spewing smoke and flame Lifeless

bodies strewn everywhere The entire base is down

EXT MOSUL ARMY BASE - DAY
The helicopter sits on the ground rotor spinning down Tyler
and the Temple Brothers get out carrying assault rifles The

Temple brothers wear swords

Belbasa kneels over the fallen soldiers They’re in a stupor
eyes rolled back whispering in tongues

BELBASA
Not dead Enchanted

He opens the kit he carries Stamps sacred seals on their
chests in black ink Anoints them with oil Waves burning
herbs under their noses The soldiers revive disoriented

Rabbu hands out kits like Belbasa’s for reviving soldiers

Help the others

They hurry to rouse the other soldiers Tyler spots soldiers
in Army Ranger uniforms Quinn and his men

INT NECROPOLIS - UNDERWORLD GATE

Huge doors of bronze grind open Ashurbanipal walks into a
cavernous hall Jenny and Lorenzo following obediently
TORCHES burst into flame as he enters illuminating the hall
Ashurbanipal gestures the giant doors slam shut behind him

A great MANDALA is carved in the floor - the grooves in the
stone filled with gold Seven interlocking circles

An elevated LECTERN overlooks the mandala Ashurbanipal lays
the SCROLL on the lectern Places Jenny in front of it She’s
sleepwalking now hopelessly in the grip of his compulsion

ASHURBANIPAL
Read the ritual

Lorenzo stands behind her Ashurbanipal hands him an ancient
BRONZE DAGGER from Lorenzo’s own collection

ASHURBANIPAL (CONT’D)
Watch her

He descends to the floor below Walks onto the mandala

Jenny reads Ancient Akkadian ringing from her lips As she
reads THE MANDALA MOVES one circle turning at a time The
runes around their edges form sequences A combination lock

She completes a phrase Chanting Ashurbanipal steps from
rune to rune in a ritual invocation THREE STONE PILLARS
stand above the mandala as Ashurbanipal walks the magical
phrase the runes BURN INTO THE FIRST PILLAR

Tyler shakes Saif’s hand as he rises speaking urgently

TYLER
Commander The man who did this to
you is down in the caves We’re
going after him

SAIF
He was no man He was a jinn

MALIK
Yes Your weapons will not work
against him

Dayan Rabbu and Belbasa unload gear from the helicopter
Every CONSECRATED BLADE from the Temple armory Wooden boxes
containing VIALS OF WHITE SALTS Modern ammo cases

These are sacred blades They will
bite even a jinn Holy salts

Saif lifts a Temple sword admiring the steel He smiles

SAIF
Allah hu Akbar

A SHOUT from the gates A battered LAND ROVER speeds onto the
base in a cloud of dust Twenty guns come up PROFESSOR
SHEPPARD gets out hands in the air His voice trembles

PROFESSOR SHEPPARD
I’m looking for Tyler Colt

Tyler steps forward astonished

TYLER
Here

PROFESSOR SHEPPARD
I have a message from Jenny Halsey
I uhI don’t know what it means

TYLER
Talk

PROFESSOR SHEPPARD
(reciting from memory)
There are three spells in the ritual
The first spell raises the city of the
dead The second restores the Dead
King to life The third makes him
immortal Between the second spell and
the third - he can be killed

Tyler and Malik exchange fierce looks There’s a chance
INT NECROPOLIS - UNDERWORLD GATE

Jenny - looking every inch the priestess with her white dress
and transported eyes - finishes reading the first spell

The runes of the mandala LOCK INTO PATTERN Ashurbanipal
paces a mystical phrase across the interlocking circles

On the pillar the first spell is completed luminous runes
filling its surface A RUMBLE The walls shake Ashurbanipal
laughs in triumph

EXT MOSUL ARMY BASE - DAY
Tyler and the Temple Brothers are rigged for battle Swords
on their hips Rifles on their shoulders Army Rangers and
Iraqi soldiers load incendiary rounds
Malik hands Tyler a TEMPLE SWORD in a scabbard

TYLER

The dude chopped down a bridge
What am I going to do with this

MALIK
The power was in his blade not his
arm I know I failed you I promise
you the Temple steel will not

Tyler gives in Straps the sword around his hips

A RUMBLE The earth shakes Dark clouds blot out the sun
WALLS AND PILLARS erupt from the ground RIFTS open in the
earth sand draining into subterranean chasms The shifting
ground topples gun turrets and swallows vehicles

MALIK (CONTD)
The first spell The Necropolis rises

TYLER
Move out Go Go

He leads a charge toward the caves Malik at his side The
Temple brothers behind them other soldiers following

But THE DEAD CRAWL FROM THE CHURNING EARTH The restless
souls of the Underworld Some are SKELETAL FIENDS Others
twisted MUSCULAR GHOULS wrapped in chains Even some of the
pale EYELESS HORRORS from the Valley of the Blind

They attack the living with clawed fingers and fangs turning
the soldiers’ advance into a chaotic melee The air fills
with screams The horrified soldiers begin to break and run

Swords flashing the Temple Brothers stand their ground where
soldiers flee American and Iraqi soldiers rally behind them

Wounded the dead bleed black ichor Burning bullets hurt
them but they take a lot of damage and keep coming The
Temple blades are another matter they put the dead down

Tyler hesitates seeing the men embattled all around him

MALIK
Kill the King and end it all

Tyler nods They run together for the caves
AT THE HELICOPTER

Professor Sheppard cowers left behind A vial of holy salts
in his hand He stares in frozen horror at the chaos

A DEMON crawls out of the ground in front of him A wasted
black figure with the skeletal head of a hawk Eyes of fire
A barbed whip coiling from its hand

The demon draws back its whip Sheppard HURLS THE SALT VIAL
It SHATTERS The finely ground salt EATS INTO THE DEMON like
hot embers It disintegrates shrieking and burning

Sheppard frantically fills his pockets with the vials Picks
up a whole crate and runs after the Temple Brothers

PROFESSOR SHEPPARD
Wait for me

INT MOSUL CAVES

Natural caverns squared off by ancient masons The Iraqi
Army has made a munitions dump of them crates of equipment
and ammo stacked against the walls A hodge-podge of modern
equipment and Soviet-era hardware in mothballs

Tyler and Malik run through the caves seeking a way down
Tyler feels the air with his scarred palm Hunting

MALIK
He built the Necropolis here because
the boundary between worlds is weak
in this place The Dead King’s spells
will tear that boundary The
Underworld will cross over into this
world Watch your step

TYLER
No sweat I’ve been to hell before

They come to an ANCIENT STONE GATEWAY flanked by Assyrian
GUARDIAN STATUES The stone gate has been raised beyond a
passageway lit by burning braziers leads deep into the earth

TYLER (CONTD)
There

But as they approach the gateway the GUARDIAN STATUES COME
TO LIFE Step down from their pedestals Ten-foot DEMONS with
heavy maces Behind them the STONE GATE BEGINS TO CLOSE

Malik engages both Guardian Demons - strafing one with his
rifle while slashing at the other Both Demons attack him

MALIK
Go Run

Tyler runs Diving under the descending gate just before it
closes Malik fighting a desperate battle against the giants
as the gate blocks him from view

Tyler runs down the long firelit causeway

Jenny finishes a phrase of the second spell The circles
turn Ashurbanipal speaks his invocation deep in a trance

Behind him the GREAT BRONZE DOOR INCHES OPEN It’s Tyler
straining with all his might to move the massive slab
Ashurbanipal pushed open so easily He squeezes inside

Jenny sits staring into space at the Lectern Ashurbanipal
chants on the mandala Tyler runs silently up the stairs

Lorenzo steps from behind a column - DAGGER PLUNGING TOWARD
TYLER’S CHEST

Tyler catches Lorenzo’s wrist Drives him back against the
wall - and PUNCHES HIM hard in the jaw Again And again
Finally the sleepwalker light in Lorenzo’s eyes goes out he
drops unconscious the dagger clattering away

Tyler kneels beside Jenny she’s a million miles away

Taking out the kit Belbasa gave him he stamps warding runes
on her skin Anoints her with oil Wafts burning herbs under
her nose Nothing happens At a loss he KISSES HER HARD

As their lips part her eyes widen in astonishment

Tyler points at the pillars The first spell complete the
second spell nearly done The third pillar still blank

TYLER

soul back from the Underworld with

His voice thunders in the hall He grins evilly up at Tyler

He LEAPS AT TYLER - a staggering leap - thirty feet onto the
stone stair Tyler FIRES - stitching the Dead King’s chest
with a dozen burning bullet holes

Ashurbanipal’s sword SLASHES - CUTTING TYLER’S RIFLE IN TWO

Tyler tumbles down the stone staircase Ashurbanipal walks
down after him with a sneer The bulletholes closing up

Tearing her eyes away from Tyler’s plight Jenny turns back
to the Lectern Reading the second spell as fast as she can

Tyler draws his Temple sword Backing onto the mandala as
Ashurbanipal advances The Dead King strikes Their blades
clash - and the Temple steel holds They fight the wheels of
the mandala turning treacherously under their feet

Jenny finishes the pattern As they fight Ashurbanipal and
Tyler stagger across the rune sequence The runes FLARE INTO
EXISTENCE on the second pillar The SECOND SPELL IS COMPLETE

GOLDEN LIGHT ERUPTS from Ashurbanipal - blinding Tyler A
transformation sweeps over his body Withered gray skin
becoming flushed and smooth The handsome face restored

cheek A drop of blood wells from the shallow cut

EXT MOSUL ARMY BASE - DAY

The battle has spread to every corner of the base Fierce
skirmishes everywhere And now on the heels of the risen
dead - DEMONS erupt from the earth They are taller than the
Dead and less human they have bestial fangs or talons
stunted wings multiple limbs Eyes of white fire

Where the Dead attack with their claws and teeth the Demons
carry hellish weaponry Flails maces whips and swords

Quinn and Saif fight back-to-back against a host of the Dead
Wielding Temple blades with more ferocity than technique

The Temple Brothers fight like heroes of old Mighty Rabbu
with a broadsword in each hand Dayan working a sword-and-
submachine-gun combo Professor Sheppard hides behind

Belbasa’s sword and lobs vials of holy salts into the fray

But as more Demons rise from the earth the Temple brothers
lose ground hard pressed A host of Demon threatens to
overwhelm them

Suddenly a ROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADE streaks into the midst of
the demons A shattering BLAST staggers them Malik arrives
beside his brothers dropping the smoking grenade launcher
He survived his battle in the caves

Tyler leaps back PULLS HIS PISTOL in an attempt to end the
fight once and for all - but Ashurbanipal closes the distance
with supernatural speed and KICKS THE GUN FROM HIS HAND

The gun falls just outside the mandala Tyler dives for it -
- and a BOLT OF LIGHTNING CRACKS ACROSS THE CAVERN

THE END
THE TRUE HISTORY OF

ASHURBANIPAL KING OF ASSYRIA
LORD OF MASSACRES

THE BLOODY EMPIRE

Assyria began as the city-state of Ashur on the banks of the Tigris in what’s now
northern Iraq Founded in the 25th Century BC it endured for two thousand years
For three hundred years—from about 900BC to about 600Bc—Assyria was the
greatest power in the world Its conquering armies ranged from Egypt to India

Assyria never knew peace Situated in the heart of Mesopotamia with no natural
boundaries to aid in its defense Assyria was locked in perpetual war with Egypt to
the East Babylon to the South and a host of city-states and tribal nations that
forever challenged its borders

To survive Assyria asserted its power—subjugating rival kings and expanding its
domain to become history’s first empire A host of military innovations powered
these conquests iron blades siege weapons mounted archersbut Assyria’s most
effective innovation was the use of horror as a weapon

Assyria’s enemies defeated in battle suffered atrocities that beggar the imagination
They were skinned alive sealed into walls impaled on stakes decapitated Limbs
were lopped off tongues and eyes torn out and all these grisly trophies placed on
display outside conquered cities The wrath of Assyria was so terrible that entire
towns committed suicide when the Assyrian army appeared outside their walls

No king of Assyria wielded the weapon of horror more ruthlessly than Ashurbanipal

THE HAUNTED KING

Ashurbanipal ruled for almost sixty years - from 685BC to 6278C¢ - consolidating
Assyria’s strength and breaking the power of Egypt and Babylon He developed a
reputation for staggering cruelty The walls of his palace at Nineveh were decorated
with scenes of battle torture and execution

But Ashurbanipal was no savage He was trained as a scholar as well as a soldier—
the only Assyrian king in two thousand years who could read and write He filled his
palace’s vast library with histories scientific texts and mystical documents

As a young man Ashurbanipal had suffered a life-changing vision In a dream he
descended to the Underworld Nergal the Lord of the Underworld showed him a
revelation the body of a king would lie in the Underworld and be protected by the
powers of darkness—and his kingdom in the upper world would flourish The Lord
of the Underworld ended his revelation with this charge “Set this word like a thorn
in your heart Go forth to the upper world until I think of you”
Ashurbanipal’s strange account of this revelation is today known as The Underworld
Vision of an Assyrian Crown Prince It prefigures the Revelation of St John the Divine
and is unlike any other document of its time

Traditionally Assyrians placed the god Ashur at the top of their pantheon but as
king Ashurbanipal gave prime position to the goddess Ishtar who according to myth
descended to the Underworld seeking power and returned again by buying her
freedom with the soul of another

Interestingly Ashurbanipal’s reign was marked by a proliferation of Egyptian
symbols in Assyrian art the ankh the lotus the winged disk It is possible that
Ashurbanipal brought back documents or even scholars from his conquest of Egypt
Obsessed as he was with the Underworld the great mortuary cult of the Egyptian
pharaohs must have made an impression on his mind

THE EMPIRE’S END
Little is known of Ashurbanipal’s passing The manner of his death is a mystery He
has no known tomb

A power struggle erupted on his demise four different kings claimed the throne for
a handful of years as Assyria’s power dwindled In 6045c less than twenty-five years
after Ashurbanipal died a resurgent Babylon overwhelmed Assyria slaughtering its
rulers razing its cities and scattering its people The two-thousand-year-old empire
was erased from history

If Ashurbanipal dwells in the Underworld now he has witnessed the utter undoing

of all he fought for It is difficult to believe his eyes are not cast upward—that he is
not striving even now like Ishtar to return in vengeance to the upper world
