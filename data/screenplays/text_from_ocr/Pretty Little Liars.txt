TEASER
FADE IN

EXT STREET - ROSEWOOD GRILL - NIGHT (N1)

It’s a quiet night in Rosewood and most of the town’s shops
are closed and empty Through the pane glass window of the
Rosewood Grill we see EMILY ARIA SPENCER and HANNA wearing
their black funeral dresses sitting at a table They are the
only patrons in the restaurant creating an iconic Edward
Hopper-like image

INT ROSEWOOD GRILL - NIGHT (N1)

Except for a few servers and one OLDER COUPLE the place is
empty However the girls talk in hushed tones

ARIA
Why was Jenna there

SPENCER
I guess she’s back

HANNA
That cop acted like we were
suspects or something

EMILY
Do you think we looked guilty

ARIA
Why would we We haven’t done
anything wrong

HANNA
-- except lie about “The Jenna
Thing”

SPENCER

We promised we’d never bring up
“The Jenna Thing” again Remember
It never happened

ARIA
Have you found a way to forget I
still wake up sometimes in the
middle of the night --

SPENCER
Aria it was an accident

( )
PRETTY LITTLE LIARS Ep 102 The Jenna Thing Blue 41210 2

Emily looks down at a friendship bracelet and nervously plays
with it She hasn’t forgotten

Hanna dumps the last of the booze from her silver flask into
her diet coke The OLDER MALE PATRON sees this Hanna catches
his look -

HANNA
It’s medicinal

He continues to judge her with his stare -

HANNA (CONT’D)
Cramps

He finally looks away
EMILY
I don’t get it How does “A” know
something about me that only Alison
knew
They share a look
ARIA
Ali knew all of our secrets but we
didn’t know any of hers

Spencer reveals -

SPENCER
I knew some

They all snap their attention to Spencer -

ARIA
Go on

HANNA
Talk

SPENCER
I can’t

Spencer is reluctant to share more
ARIA
Spence you are not going to drop a
bomb like that and clam up

SPENCER
Shed so kill me if I told you

( )
PRETTY LITTLE LIARS Ep 102 The Jenna Thing Blue 41210 3

HANNA
She’s dead

Off their looks recovering

SPENCER
Ali was seeing someone that summer

EMILY
I knew she was keeping something
from me From us

ARIA
Why didn’t she want us to know
SPENCER
He was an older boy And he had a
girlfriend
EMILY

Who was it

HANNA

Can we at least have initials
SPENCER

She never told me his name
HANNA

That’s only half a secret
SPENCER

It’s more than you ever got from

her
ARIA

How was it that Alison told us
nothing and we told her everything

EMILY
She made us feel like we were a
part of something special

HANNA
We were

ARIA
I miss that

SPENCER
Me too

( )
PRETTY LITTLE LIARS Ep 102 The Jenna Thing Blue 41210

EMILY
I miss Ali

Moment A server refills Spencer’s coffee cup and drops a
packet of sugar onto the table

ARIA
She’s gonna need more than that

EMILY
(off the server’s look)
She hates the taste but loves the
rush

He drops three more packets and sure enough Spencer pours
all of the sugar into her coffee

As Emily hands Hanna a spoon Hanna notices a friendship
bracelet that Emily wears

HANNA
I can’t believe you still wear
that

EMILY

We swore we’d never take them off
Alison still wears hers Wore

After a moment

ARIA
So for the entire year I was gone
Jenna was away

SPENCER
She left Rosewood that night and
never came back

ARIA
If Jenna is “A” then this is about
revenge

HANNA

Sorry but “A” is “watching” us and
that rules out Jenna

The girls shoot Hanna a look Did she just say that Off of
their looks -

HANNA (CONTD)
Those sunglasses aren’t a fashion
statement She’s blind

( )

PRETTY LITTLE LIARS Ep 102 The Jenna Thing Blue 41210

Hanna grabs a sweet potato fry from the communal plate on the
table She mindlessly munches on it

Emily continues to nervously play with her friendship
bracelet Spencer watches this and the discussion takes a
turn down memory lane

SPENCER
When Ali didn’t come home I knew
something terrible must have
happened to her but there was a
part of me that imagined someday
she would just show up

ARIA
I used to think maybe Ali had run
off with some guy

EMILY
That she was laying on a beach
somewhere -

HANNA

Getting a tan with that hot
lifeguard who worked at the pool

ARIA
What was his name

HANNA
Who cares “Save me”

They laugh and for a moment they’re just four friends again
And then after the laughter fades Spencer almost cracks

SPENCER
I can’t believe she’s gone

Then the rhythmic sound of a repeated TAP TAP grows closer
and louder The girls look in the direction of the sound

ANGLE ON A white cane with a red tip tapping back and forth
PAN UP TO REVEAL --

JENNA wearing dark sunglasses as she stands in the doorway
of the restaurant

Aria Hanna Spencer and Emily practically hold their breath
as they watch Jenna find her way to a seat at the counter
She is far enough away that they don’t hear her order from
the server The PLLs exchange silent looks Spencer is the
first to stand Her friends silently follow her lead

( )

PRETTY LITTLE LIARS Ep 102 The Jenna Thing Blue 41210 6

The PLLs don’t utter a sound as they walk past Jenna and out
of the restaurant

EXT ROSEWOOD GRILL - NIGHT (N1)

sees up ahead EZRA walking toward his parked car He has
taken off his tie but still wears the dark suit he wore to
Ali’s funeral As he is about to climb into his car he
looks up and sees Aria They lock eyes for a long moment
Then he offers a charming and disarming smile that invites a
smile from Aria

EZRA
I thought about you all day Are
you okay

ARIA
I will be

EZRA
It’s hard to lose someone youre
close to It changes you

ARIA
We lost Alison a year ago Today
was more about admitting it to
ourselves

After a moment -

EZRA
Id offer you a ride -

ARIA
- but I’d have to say “no” I
meant what I said Ezra I’d never
do anything that would get you into
trouble

EZRA
And being alone with you in my car
would probably lead to trouble

She considers the kind of trouble they would get into and a
flirtatious smile comes across her face

ARIA
Yeah

( )

PRETTY LITTLE LIARS Ep 102 The Jenna Thing Blue 41210

EZRA
(playfully teasing)
But if it’s only a few miles

Now they are both thinking about the kind of trouble they
would love to get into and it’s sizzling

ARIA
(playfully prudent)
Ezra

Aria notices the small shopping bag he’s holding

ARIA (CONTD)
So what did you buy

He pulls out a CD It’s The Fray

EZRA
B26

The look they share tells us they both recognize the
significance of his purchase He wanted to savor their
moment

BETH a female student from Rosewood High approaches and
recognizes both of them

STUDENT
Hi Aria Hey Mr Fitz

Both Aria and Ezra shift their personas to a student-teacher
dynamic

ARIA EZRA
Hey Hi Beth
STUDENT (CONTD)
Cute car

Aria locks eyes with Ezra This sucks

ARIA
Good night Mr Fitz

He wants to grab her and kiss her but -

EZRA
I’1l see you at school

She watches him get into his car and drive away

the house

PETER
Youre thinking about a college
credit class Spence That’s a
great idea

MELISSA and WREN approach from the barn and join the

impromptu

family meal

MELISSA
I took a Poli-Sci class at Hollis
my junior year It was fun

SPENCER
That’s what I was thinking I’m
looking for something fun

PETER
For a local college Hollis has an
excellent Economics program

WREN
Economics that sounds like a
bloody load of fun

Melissa gives him a playful shrug

MELISSA
Like her older sister Spencer is
on the fast track to an Ivy League
education

PETER
Spence I really do like the idea
but I want to make sure you have
time for the commitments you’ve
already taken on Class President
has always been a big undertaking
for you

running

WREN

A modest Hastings Now that’s
something one doesn’t see every
day

PETER
The Hastings girls are ambitious
Wren That’s why they’re so
successful

His tone suggests he doesn’t appreciate Wren’s humor Wren
knows to back off

PETER (CONT’D)
So what are you thinking Spence

Spencer closes the catalogue

SPENCER
I haven’t decided yet

WILDEN
The coroner released his findings

Looking and feeling like four guilty little girls the PLLs
squeeze together on the couch Detective Wilden stands while
he questions them

Wilden reviews his notes then -

WILDEN
(to Spencer)
You thought you heard her “scream”

SPENCER
I said that yeah

He looks to Aria Emily and Hanna -

WILDEN
And when you three woke up in the
barn - Alison was gone but so was
Spencer

SPENCER
Yes I woke up before them and I
realized Ali was gone -

WILDEN
(recounting her statement)
- So you went to look for her

SPENCER
That’s what happened

WILDEN
Was this a slumber party

SPENCER
Is this an interrogation

WILDEN
No Just a routine follow-up Why
did you all fall asleep

ARIA
I guess we were tired

WILDEN
Is that how it was Hanna

( )

PRETTY LITTLE LIARS Ep 102 The Jenna Thing Blue 41210

HANNA

SPENCER
Weve told you everything we know
Just like we did the night she went

The PLLs sit together at a table Their lunches are in
of them but no one is interested in eating

ARIA
He knows we’re lying

HANNA
Lying’s not a crime

SPENCER
It is when you’re giving false
statements to the police It’s
called obstruction of justice --

HANNA
Oh please We lied about drinking
The truth that matters is we don’t
know anything about what happened
to Ali that night

SPENCER
We also know about someone who
might have wanted to hurt her

EMILY
We should have told the police the
truth about Jenna’s accident the
night it happened

HANNA
I wanted to remember

ARIA
We had a chance to do more than
tell the truth We had a chance to
stop Ali

SPENCER
But we didn’t

As they exchange a remorseful look Mona carrying her lunch
tray approaches She sees Hanna sitting with her old BFFs
Hurt she walks away

SPENCER (CONTD)
Telling the police now about what
happened to Jenna isn’t going to
make her see again It’ll just
ruin our lives

Aria looks past Emily and sees -
Jenna standing alone carrying her lunch tray
HANNA
Oh my God she’s back in school
too
A boy who’s not paying too much attention bumps into Jenna
She’s vulnerable Lost Without a second thought Aria
stands and approaches her The PLLs watch as -
Aria approaches Jenna
ARIA
Jenna it’s Aria Would you like
to join us

The invitation surprises Jenna After a moment

JENNA
Sure

Aria leads Jenna toward the PLLs who can’t believe she is
heading their way

ARIA
Here’s a chair You’re between
Hanna and Spencer and Emily is
directly across from you

Jenna and Aria both sit down

PRETTY LITTLE LIARS Ep 102 The Jenna Thing Blue 41210

So this would be Alison’s chair
EMILY
No We’re not even sitting at that
table
JENNA

You know she came to see me in the
hospital after the accident

SPENCER

Hanna nervously pops a tater tot into her mouth as the PLLs
share an extremely surprised look toward Jenna

Jenna is pleasant as pie

What else

The girls

JENNA
So many people misunderstood her
But I knew exactly who Alison was

does she know

SPENCER
When did you get back Jenna We
heard you were in Philadelphia at a
school for the visually impaired

JENNA
You can say blind Spencer It’s
not a dirty word

EXT CAVANAUGHS BACKYARD - JULY 4TH - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

Fireworks explode in the distance Alison leads the charge
as the PLLs follow her and sneak across the lawn toward a
free standing garage

As they near the garage Alison pulls a stink bomb
firecracker from her pocket

They stop

ARIA
Are we sure he’s not in there

ALISON
(looking at the dark barn)
He’s not okay You’ve got the
lighter right Spencer

EMILY
Let’s wait a second

Alison annoyed turns to her

ALISON
What Emily

EMILY
I don’t want to do this

ALISON
Fine Go back You’re on your own

She doesn’t want to be on her own and Ali knows it

ARIA
Maybe Emily’s right If we tell the
police they’1ll bring him in
They’1ll take care of it

ALISON
What’s the fun in that
(nobody answers then )

Toby Cavanaugh is a freak and we
need to teach hima lesson If he
thinks he can come and spy on us
while we’re in your bedroom Emily
he needs to know that his “domain”
is no longer a safe little hideout

Alison looks over at the garage

ALISON (CONT’D)
Who knows what he does in there all
day that freak

SPENCER
Are you sure it was Toby

ALISON
Yes and it’s a stink bomb for
Gods sakes We’re not nuking the
place Now let’s do it

She sneaks closer to the garage The PLLs exchange cautious
looks but then one-by-one they follow their leader

When they reach the garage Alison opens the top half of the
Dutch door and peaks inside ALISON’S POV the garage is Toby’s
lair Exercise equipment Computer stuff Cool band posters
decorate the walls

ALISON (CONTD)
Give me the lighter

Spencer hands Ali who is gleeful the lighter She ignites

the firecracker fuse and when it sparks she tosses it into

the garage She takes one last look inside For a beat she
locks eyes on something (Spencer clocks her) Then Alison
snaps her attention back to the PLLs

ALISON (CONT’D)
Let’s get out of here

She runs back across the yard and the PLLs run along side of
her What they don’t see is that behind them - inside the
garage - flames have erupted Then they hear it the sound
that changes their lives forever - A TEENAGE GIRL’S TERRIFIED
SCREAM

Alison and the PLLs stop dead in their tracks as the garage
burns behind them

She hands the phone to Spencer The PLLs all look down at

It’s her TRANSFER REQUEST FORM stamped DECLINED

away -

SEAN

HANNA
No

over the GLOW OF RED TAIL LIGHTS illuminate in the rain
Ezra brakes and opens the passenger door

INT EZRA’S CAR - MOVING - MOMENTS LATER - DAY (D4)

Aria sits in the passenger seat as Ezra drives Neither says
a word But for the rain it is perfectly silent Ezra
pulls over on a quiet street and parks the car They both
stare straight ahead knowing that if they look at each other
they will give into their passion

Finally she turns to face him

INT ARIA’S ENTRYWAYLIVING ROOM - DAY (D4)

Aria damp from the rain walks into the house to find her
dad sitting alone on the couch He looks up from his book

BYRON
We need to talk

She stands frozen Is she busted

BYRON (CONTD)
What you’re doing isn’t right

She looks at him wondering what he knows

BYRON (CONTD)
Youre not very good at hiding your
feelings Your mother knows
something’s wrong

So this isn’t about Ezra Relieved Aria takes off her
jacket and walks into the room She sits across from him

BYRON (CONT’D)
Look Aria I don’t like to lie
but sometimes telling the truth
does more harm than good When we
were in Europe you found a way to
let go of what happened

ARIA
Are you seeing her again

BYRON
She teaches at Hollis so I do see
her But not like that

ARIA
Were you in love with her

Moment

BYRON
I had very strong feelings for
Meredith but my attraction to her
was as much of a surprise to me as
it was to her I had no intention
of being unfaithful to your mother
and you’re probably too young to
understand this - but the truth is -
I gave into my emotions

inspired today - she runs like she’s trying to escape
herself Then she stops when she sees --

Jenna sitting on a bus bench Jenna holds a voice activated
cell phone to her lips and quietly commands it to --

at Spencer It feels like she can see her (We know she
cant) Spencer stands frozen as Jenna finally stands and
walks off in the opposite direction

ARIA
I’m getting out of these wet
clothes

Aria walks toward the staircase She stops and looks back at
her family It’s a picture-perfect Hallmark card moment as
they look and feel like the happy family Aria has always
cherished

She smiles It’s all good Aria’s cell phone RINGS She
looks down at the text - the reality of “A” hits her It’s
like she’s pumping ice water into Aria’s veins

ANGLE ON PHONE The text reads “When students kiss teachers
someone gets HURT Thats a promise Ill keep” -A
