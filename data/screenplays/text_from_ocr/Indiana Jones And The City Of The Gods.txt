e REAL MOUNTAIN in a parched land Even the air here is
sun-baked Buzzards ride the thermals

A STRANGE DISTANT RUMBLE rises and falls teasing us

TILT DOWN to reveal a long ribbon of road coming at camera
heat shimmering from blacktop a LIZARD sunning itself

There’s that RUMBLE again swelling louder Thunder on the
horizon Well no it’s

TWO HOT-RODS roaring into view They’re racing full-out neck
and neck RADIOS BLASTING Bill Haley and The Comets’ great 1954
hit “Shake Rattle and Roll” across the desert

The lizard scurries off The hot-rods loom large engulfing
us with noise and fury We WHIP PAN WITH THEM as they zip by
us in the blink of an eye and a swirling cloud of dust

EXT ATOMIC CAFE NEVADA DESERT - DAY

and the Atomic Cafe is revealed as the dust clears -- a
windswept roadhouse diner with a MISSILE-SHAPED NEON SIGN

CLOSER ANGLE

A MAN is also revealed He’s just gotten out from behind the
wheel of his olive-drab PANEL TRUCK and is coughing and waving
the dust from his face PUSH IN on the man INDIANA JONES as
he peers after the hot-rods with a sour look

INDY
Damn kids

His Friend YURI MAKOVSKY is laughing as he gets out of the
passenger side He’s got a Russian accent

YURI
American kids Indy Having fun
You should take a lesson

He claps Indy on the shoulder as they head toward the diner
MUSIC can be heard within “Wayward Wind” by Gogi Grant

INT ATOMIC CAFE -— DAY
«which is coming from a SEEBURG ROCK-OLA JUKEBOX trimmed in

neon and bubbling water tubes A WAITRESS enters frame taking
us across the diner as she navigates the room balancing two

plates of food and a pot of coffee The cafe’s clientele is a
mix of LOCAL RANCHERS and off-duty ARMY and AIR FORCE PERSONNEL
The waitress arrives at --

A BOOTH TABLE

-- and sets a plate down It’s slopping over with a BURGER
AND FRIES A MAN’S HANDS enter frame lift the burger off the
plate TILT UP to reveal Yuri gazing rapturously at it

YURI
I love America

Indy seated across from him can’t help smiling as Yuri
takes a swooning bit

YURI
I love hamburgers I love French
fries I love Gogi Grant on the
jukebox You know what I love more
than Gogi Grant

He raises a bottle of ketchup in to view

YURI
Ketchup It is a miracle In my
country such things do not exist
Hereketchup everywhere Much as
you want

He uncaps the ketchup drowning his French fries Amused the
waitress glances to Indy

WAITRESS
Want more coffee hon

INDY
Please

She freshens his cup and moves off Yuri admires her figure

YURT

What do I love most of all The
beautiful lady who brings it all to
me In Russia the waitresses look
like weight-lifters Here they are
like Lana Turner

(big grin)
I LOVE AMERICA

PEOPLE glance over Yuri meets the eyes of some SOLDIERS and
gives them a big thumbs-up Indy just shrugs

INDY
He’snew

The men smile and resume eating
YURI
And you my friend What do you love

INDY
Me

Indy thinks a moment He pulls a handkerchief from the
pocket to reveal delicate shards of Native American Pottery

INDY
I love these

CUT TO
EXT INDY’S CAMP - DESERT FOOTHILLS - LATE DAY

CLOSEUP ON MORE POTTERY FRAGMENTS lying on the dusty ground
next to a small ruler to provide scale

INDY (0S)
Anasazi Indian pottery Classic
Pueblo period 1050 to 1300 AD

FLASH A CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS TILT UP to reveal Indy kneeling
over a camera on a low tripod He winds the film to the next
frame makes a careful notation in his notebook

INDY
They developed a very high degree
of pottery skills in that period

Yuri enters frame putting on a tie and getting spruced up

YURI
(wry)
Words cannot describe my
excitement
INDY

Yeah wiseguy I see you go off
somewhere every day and come back
emptyhanded What are you trying
to dig up

YURI
Tonight A little company I hope
(Indy glances up)
Perhaps a trip to town The beautiful
lady with the ketchup That is if
you’11l lend me your truck

Indy laughs pulls his keys tosses them

INDY
Knock yourself out Yuri

Yuri crouches down becoming serious
YURI
Indy I want to say how good it was
to meet up with you again I thank
you for sharing your encampment

(taps his heart)
Ogromnoya spasibo

INDY
N’ezashto pozhalsta This sounds
like goodbye

YURI

YURI
It no longer calls to you Adventure
The thrill of the chase

INDY
Nyet Not me pal

YURI
You‘re not the same man I knew all

name

They share a wistful smile Yuri caps Indy on the shoulder
rises and walks away

CUT TO
EXT INDY’S CAMP - DESERT FOOTHILLS - MAGIC HOUR

The panel truck rumbles off with Yuri at the wheel Indy
feeding his tethered HORSE turns and waves goodbye

cuT TO
EXT CREST OF A RIDGE - MAGIC HOUR
The camp is several hundreds yards below Indy hikes up the
ridge with a NATIVE AMERICAN FLUTE to his lips blowing various
notes trying to get the hang of it The beauty and quiet
here are surreal the hills painted red by the setting sun
He gets to the crest and gazes off at the endless desert The
sun is an orange ball above the horizon Indy finishes his
flute practice with a few bars of “Take The A-Train” as we

DISSOLVE TO
EXT SAME RIDGE - MAGIC HOUR - SHORTLY LATER

CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN on Indy -- he’s sitting comfortably
against the rocks checking a terrain map and making entries
in his little notebook He’s eating a sandwich softly humming
“Take The A-Train” The picture of contentment CAMERA SETTLES
on his profile beautifully backlit by the setting sun

eee a along tr of appe cin
across the ue or floor The FAINT SOUND OF AN ENGINE makes
Indy look up There’s a vehicle out there going like a bat out
of hell

Suddenly two more trails of dust come from the opposite
direction racing out to meet the first Indy can’t help
smiling a bit

INDY
Damn kids

He pulis his binoculars from his knapsack raises them
BINOCULAR POV

sweeps across the desert pinning the first vehicle as it races

along It’s not a hot-rod It’s a panel truck just like
Indy’s Same rounded silhouette and everything The driver

slams on the brakes in a big swirl of dust and hops out
waiting for the other vehicles to arrive It’s Yuri

INDY

peers over his binoculars surprised He raises the binoculars
again pans them around

BINOCULAR POV

SWISH-PAN to other two vehicles TWO MILITARY JEEPS race along
precariously loaded with OVER A DOZEN MEN between them A few
are in civilian clothes but most wear military fatigues
Among them are THREE MPs

The jeeps stop at the panel truck Men jump down in a flurry
of activity Weapons are handed out orders given

Two “soldiers” rush to Indy’s truck and slap magnetic skins

on the doors -- the skins are olive green with white stars
instantl i Indy’s truck into itary vehicle The

back doors are swung open and men pile inside with weapons

The vehicles head off together directly into the setting
sun Due west

INDY

lowers his binoculars stunned He grabs his map jabs his
finger on his present position drags his finger west
CLOSE ON MAP

and stops His finger’s on a circled area marked
“Restricted Military Zone”

INDY

gazes up after the departing vehicles Boy does he not want
to get involved in this

INDY
Aw nuts

CUT TO
EXT INDY’S CAMP - MOMENTS LATER

Indy spurs his horse with a wild cry gallop full speed down
the mountain path

EXT DESERT - DUSK

Indy races across the desert his horses hooves pounding up
dust in the gathering darkness

He reins back pausing to get his bearings He looks around
sees taillights in the distance He spurs his horse again
galloping in pursuit CAMERA ENDFRAMES ON A WEATHERED SIGN
Military Area HIGHLY RESTRICTED Civilians Turn Back”
curt TO
EXT DESERT HILLS - NIGHT

Through a break in the rocks we catch a glimpse of the
vehicles traveling below

Indy gallops into frame fg guiding his horse along a
bouldered path tracking them

He hears the VEHICLES SLOWING He dismounts scurries to a
hidden vantage point Peering around a boulder he gets a
limited view of what’s happening below

THREE FIGURES jump from the idling vehicles and hurry toward
the shadowy rocks -- it’s Yuri leading the way accompanied
by a pair of MPs

Yuri turns waves the vehicles on Indy climbs up to get a

better view of where the vehicles are heading and WE BOOM UP
to reveal

A huge MILITARY BASE Lights twinkling in the desert air
Indy jumps down hurrying after Yuri and the MPs
ANOTHER AREA

-and arrives at the last place he saw them They‘re gone
no sign at all Indy checks the area

-and notices a hole in the ground mostly hidden by loose
scrub He kicks the scrub aside and drops to his hands and
knees seeing faint light below realizing its

A TUNNEL

Indy’s head pops in upside-down looks around He squeezes
through and falls into a very cramped tunnel A long string of
lightbulbs glowing dimly on a wire leading off into darkness

There’s just enough room to crawl in here Indy goes as fast
as he can

EXT MILITARY BASE - NIGHT

--and his head thrusts out of the ground suddenly wearing a
hat of fake turf He tosses it aside and scurries out to get his
bearings Hes inside the compound near the perimeter fence

This area’s a secluded backwater of the base There are no
barracks or people here -- it’s an experimental area with
rows of huge hangars and mysterious dark buildings beyond
which are miles of aircraft runways

APPROACHING ENGINES draw Indy’s attention Hugging the shadows
he races along the fence toward

EXT GUARD BOOTHENTRY GATE - NIGHT

Behind the booth Indy trips over something in the darkness
and goes sprawling on his face He rolls over

-and sees it’s TWO UNCONSCIOUS MPs lying bound and gagged
in the weeds

Indy glances up The top half of the guard booth is glassed
all around He rises peering in through the back window
FAKE MP 1 stands just outside the booth door with his back
to us Beyond him Indy can see

THE JEEPS AND PANEL TRUCK

rumble through the outer gate and stop at the inner security
gate FAKE MP 2 steps to the lead jeep

FAKE MP 2
Authorization please

STANISLAV the driver hands him a piece of paper and mutters
in a Russian accent
STANISLAV
Button that collar idiot Try to
look like a soldier

The MP complies glowering then turns

FAKE MP 2
Clear

INDY

ducks from sight as Fake MP 1 steps into the booth picks
up a handset and thumbs the toggle

FAKE MP 1
This is gate twelve

(checks a clipboard)
-eprotocol tango hotel x-ray
one one three eight We have
vehicles authorization is good
request you unlock inner gate

VOICE (filtered)
Roger

A RED LIGHT on the panel goes off a GREEN LIGHT goes on A
BUZZER is heard and the inner gate swings open via remote

The vehicles enter the compound Yuri darts from the darkness
across the way and leaps into a jeep waving them forward

ANGLE SHIFTS from the departing vehicles to TIGHT ON Indy
crouching behind the booth His gaze goes to

A dumpster filled with discarded materials On the ground
next to empty paint cans is a stack of two-by-four ends

IN THE BOOTH
Fake MP 2 joins his partner in the booth grumbling

FAKE MP 2
Russkies If they didn’t pay so
good I’d hand ‘em a headache
Especially that Stansilav Every
time I turn around he busts my
chops

He turns around and gets his chops busted WHAM A two-by-
fourin the face He goes down like a sack of cement

Indy in the doorway swings his two-by-four again MP 1
ducks and Indy misses bashing out a window instead The man
yanks his sidearm but Indy slams him into the wall and the
GUN FIRES into the floor

A quick desperate struggle in the cramped booth the men
grappling at close quarters Indy’s keeping his adversary’s
gun-hand pinned and pointed away as best he can The GUN FIRES
a few more times the shots going wild

Indy punches the guy’s lights out He steps over him grabs
the handset off the panel and thumbs the toggle

INDY
Gate twelve here Uh help Spies
are infiltrating the base Bring
guns bombs mean dogs

His voice trails off TILT DOWN off his look to reveal a
SMOKING BULLET HOLE in the communications panel

Indy does a slow burn tosses the handset aside He pulls his
binoculars and steps to the door

BINOCULARS POV

The vehicles stop at a huge dark hangar down the row A large
rolling door slides open to let them in

INDY

lowers the binoculars wondering what the hell to do He
glances at the unconscious spies as we

WIPE TO
INT HANGAR - NIGHT

Indy looms from the shadows wearing MP khakis and helmet
The hangar’s a huge cavern filled withwell everything
It’s a maze of gantries catwalks experimental arcana
machinery and mountains of crates marked “Top Secret” He
presses on hearing voices ahead

YURI (0S)
What do you mean it’s not good
enough That was the deal

QUIMBY (0S)
The deal has changed

ANOTHER AREA

Shadowy men led by Yuri are arrayed in an open area near
Indys panel truck the rear doors of which stand open and
awaiting cargo The scene is lit from above by china hats
putting tense and sweaty faces into heavy light and shadow

YURI
The deal can’t be changed
Arrangements have been made This
has been a year in the planning

He motions Stanislav to his side Stanislav raises an attache
case unleashing it It’s full of neatly stacked money

ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal PROFESSORS QUIMBY AND AVERY two
American scientists Quimby’s a mousy little fellow with a
pocketwatch in his vest Avery’s taller and stouter wearing
a rather distinctive pale yellow plaid suit

Most significantly a 3 FOOT-TALL ROUND METAL CANISTER sits
on the floor securely clamped to an unusual titanium-frame
pallet with rubber shocks On the canister the word
“PLUTONIUM” is stenciled under an atomic symbol

AVERY
We talked it over Considering the
risks were taking it’s not enough

QUIMBY
Were offering twenty pounds of our
highest grade plutoniumplus this
of course

Oddly enough he raises a bowling ball bag into view It’s
incongruous and highly distinctive made all the more so by
the red-green-and-black tartan pattern on its sides

QUIMBY
You tell me Mr Makovsky -- whats
that worth to your Comrade Krushchev

ANGLE ON FAKE MP 3

tensely watching the proceedings Hands reach out of the
darkness behind him and yank him into the shadows

YURI (0S)
The question is Professor Quimby
what is it worth to you

and Indy steps out to take his place The overhead lights
and his MP helmet cast a deep shadow over his face

RESUME SCENE

QUIMBY
Professor Avery suggested we double
the fee I quite agree

YURI
(looks to Avery)
Very well

A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT Yuri has fired a small pistol from inside
his overcoat pocket A smoking hole appears in the fabric

Professor Avery clutches his heart blood suddenly trickling
through his fingers He drops dead at Quimby’s feet
ll

Quimby is frozen with fear as Yuri draws closer Yuri takes the
attache case of money from Stanislav and offers it to Quimby

YURI
Now you don’t have to split it two
ways Your fee is double

Yuri takes the bowling ball bag and hands it off to

THE THIN MAN An extremely thin and sinister individual dressed
all in black He looks like Death in a homburg hat Make no
mistake -- there’s enormous power coiled in his wraith-like
frame His rat-thin face displays an old livid scar that

runs forehead to chin bisecting a milky dead eye

YURI
You have arrangements to make Go

The Thin Man nods and departs like an oiled shadow vanishing
toward the exit Yuri snaps his fingers at his men They hop
to it scurrying to load the plutonium in the truck

Indy jumps in to help brushing past Yuri’s elbow his face
shadowed by his MP’s helmet He grabs a corner of the pallet
and helps lift it off the floor They maneuver it through the
rear doors of the panel truck slide it in the last few feet

YURI
in Russian subtitled)
The body Quickly

Everybody turns rushing to Professor Avery lying dead on the
floor preparing to lift him

- except Indy who goes unnoticed around the back of the
truck and strides to the driver’s open window A RUSSIAN DRIVER
is at the wheel eyeing the rearview mirror and waiting for a
go signal He tosses Indy an irritated look

DRIVER
Che nado

INDY
No loading zone pal

WHAM Indy punches him through the open window The guy tumbles
from view Indy jumps in FIRES UP THE ENGINE He jams it in
gear and floors it tires spinning smoke --

THE TRUCK

wipes from view revealing the spies standing there lugging a
dead guy in a yellow suit Yuri rushes forward

YURI
(in Russian subtitled)
Wait Come back you idiot

INTEXT TRUCK

Indy gets to the end of the aisle and spins the wheel through
a hard 90-degree turn the truck’s rear doors banging around
like open shutters The path ahead is blocked He spins the
wheel 90 degrees again and is suddenly going back the way he
came only down a different aisle

YURI AND HIS MEN

see the truck coming back They make a lateral dash through
the machinery and crates into the next aisle Yuris waving
his arms and hollering for the truck to stop --

-- and he sees Indy at the wheel Stunned Yuri spins toward
camera as the truck blasts by him The men OPEN FIRE with
Russian “burp guns” on full auto tearing up the back of Indy’s
truck with bullets Yuri waves his arms hollering

YURI
(in Russian subtitled)
NO NO CEASE FIRE CEASE FIRE
(off their looks)
You’1l hit the plutonium you fools
Aim for the driver Go go

A mad scramble Somebody hits a switch turning on the main
overhead lights Men pile into the two jeeps and peel off in
pursuit with Stanislav driving Jeep 1 The rest led by
Yuri pursue on foot through the maze of machinery

THE CHASE (INSIDE THE HANGAR)

and it is a maze the world’s biggest stuffed with
everything you can imagine creating “roads” in countless

directions -- but no obvious way out Indy drives like a

Maniac turning this way and that looking for an exit -

- while the jeeps hurtle along on parallel or intersecting
courses trying to hem him in one moment converging the next
being forced to split off in different directions (giving Mr
Spielberg the opportunity to stage the most breath-takingly
outrageous near misses every put on film) GUNFIRE IS ERUPTING
from all directions as men in jeeps or on foot try to kill

Indy or shot out his tires

INTEXT TRUCK

Indy takes a tire-shrieking turn and floors it down a long
straight aisle His eyes go wide as

Up ahead Jeep 1 hurtles into his path with Stanislav at the
wheel coming right at him The MAN in the jeep’s passenger
seat raises his burp gun and FIRES OFF A BURST Indy ducks as
the bullets stitch a line of holes across his windshield

Indy slams on his brakes throws it in reverse and floors it

again backing up at full speed both vehicles now going in

the same direction

Suddenly meys s eyes go wide again -- through the open rear
rs s eer a a £ OI 2

With moments to spare Indy spins the wheel sending the truck
into a sliding 90-degree turn (still backing up) abruptly
clearing the aisle --

- and revealing the two jeeps to each other Coming head-on
Both drivers hit the brakes -- too late They collide with
Jeep2 tipping onto its side and sliding vaulting men through
the air And just when every body’s coming to the senses

Indy nails them again flooring it out of there in forward
gear He plows through the jeeps and off he goes

Stanislav furiously cranks his ignition His jeep RE-STARTS
Still in the chase He takes off after Indy with three men
hanging on for dear life leaving the others behind

Yuri and his men run up to gather the dazed troops They
start tipping the remaining jeep back onto its wheels but

QUIMBY (0S)
This way

They all look Quimby’s clutching his attache case pointing
QUIMBY
They11 have to come back around
We can cut them off
Everybody runs off with Quimby leading the way
THE TRUCK AND JEEP
hurtle past wiping frame --

-- as bg Quimby leads the men swarming through a shadowy
forest of machinery and lathes running to intercept

IN THE TRUCK

Indy cranks the wheel He looks ahead seeing

QUIMBY AND YURI

run up and stop the others at their heels Weapons are raised
and cocked as the truck nears Much to every body’s surprise
Quimby motions sternly for them to hold their fire

YURI
What are you doing

The truck ROARS by Quimby smiles at a HUGE SIGN above them
“ENGINE TEST AREA EXTREME HAZARD
IN THE TRUCK

Indy glances back puzzled They let him pass He laughsbut
the laugh dies as he realizes where he is

Qn both sides of him aiming inward massive JET ENGINES are

bolted horizontally to the floor - two awesome rows one on
each side at least a dozen engines to a row

YURI AND QUIMBY

The jeep races by in pursuit Quimby turns and we TILT DOWN to
reveal a CONTROL PANEL on a steel podium Two rows of BIG RED
BUTTONS match the layout of the jet engines Quimby punches

the last two buttons top and bottom

THE TWO JET ENGINES

face each other across the aisie at the end of the rows They
work up with a RISING TURBINE WHINE and then KA-BOOOM MASSIVE
ERUPTIONS OF WHITE-HOT FLAME shoot out --

THE TRUCK

-- creating an INSTANT BARRIER OF FIRE Indy locks up the
brakes and comes to a screeching stop within yards of the jet-
propelled inferno The ROAR is deafening The jeep stops some
ten yards behind the truck Men jump out brandishing weapons

RUSSIAN SPY
OUT OF THE TRUCK

Indy sighs takes his hands off the steering wheel and raises
them preparing to get out of the truck

FAVORING QUIMBY

when suddenly the control panel CLICKS AND BUZZES Quimby
looks down sees a message flash red “COMMENCE RANDOM FIRING
SEQUENCE” His eyes go wide

INTEXT TRUCK

»-and so do Indy’s Hes hearing another jet engine STARTING —
TO WHINE He glances over It’s right next to him He jams
the truck in reverse and peels rubber backing up as

BOOOOOM The engine FIRES barely missing him

The ENGINES START FIRING in fast random overlapping sequence
HUGE PILLARS OF FLAME blasting out and shutting down again
within seconds on off on offthe only warning being a few
seconds of TURBINE WHINE preceding each explosion

The three spies from Jeep 1 turn and run screaming for their
lives trying to escape the corridor of flaming death Two of
the men are caught on the run instantly incinerated

Stanislav spins the jeep around and floors it trying to get

back out It looks like he’s going to make it He’s only got
a few yards left to go

BOOOQOM an ENGINE BLAST catches the jeep It catapults right
past Yuri and Quimby like a flaming cartwheel Disgusted

Yuri moves off leaving Quimby frantically pressing buttons
INTEXT TRUCK

Indy’s frantically driving the truck forwards and backwards
avoiding the jet-blasts by mere feet jamming the gears
flooring it again and again wheels spinning and throwing up
smoke He’s barely on e step ahead of the flames judging where
they’1l be by the WHINING SOUNDS that precede them

Suddenly the truck bucks violently and gives off a HORRIBLE
GEAR-SHREDDING SOUND

BENEATH THE TRUCK

and the drivetrain falls off clanging to the floor ina
smoking heap

INTEXT TRUCK

Indy raises his right arm into view -- the entire gear shift
assembly has come off in his hand

Suddenly the driver he punched out earlier comes to and sits
up in confusion RACK FOCUS to a huge jet engine next to him
BEGINNING TO WHINE Indy whispers hoarsely

INDY
Run

Indy jumps out The driver just looks around

DRIVER
Aah Che--

And BOQOOGOM Indy dives clear as a BLAST OF FLAME punches
through the panel truck buckling the sheet metal into molten
fragments and spinning the vehicle completely upside-down
YURIS MEN

see Indy run clear They OPEN FIRE

INDY

runs a gauntlet of FLAMING JET-BLASTS while ducking bullets
shucking and jiving for all he’s worth It’s a deadly game of

“redlight-green-light with the igniting flames Indy jumping
back one moment diving forward the next

--and he finally makes it out the far end braking into a
full-out run Suddenly from out of the shadows

WHAM Indy gets body-slammed by somebody and goes flying He
crashes into a row of steel shelves and sends them over like
dominoes scattering engine parts everywhere

Indy sits up painfully shaking his head to clear it and
gazes up to see what hit him It’s Yuri He gives Indy a wry
shake of his head offers his hand to him to help him up

indy takes his hand pulls himself off the ground -- and rams
his head into Yuri’s stomach driving him back More shelves go
flying Yuri manages to stay on his feet yanks Indy upright
and punches him so hard it spins Indy around

Indy lets Yuri have it right back landing a solid punch that
snaps Yuri’s head back and bloodies his nose Yuri just shakes
it off smiles at Indy through bloody teeth and

WHAM Indy gets nailed with an uppercut that lifts him clean
off his feet He flies back through the air --

ANGLE ON “COCKPIT”

-- and lands jarringly in what appears to be a small cockpit
simulator of some sort It’s got hardly any instruments just
a few dials and a pull-handle marked “FIRE”

Indy tries to sit up but Yuri shoves him back in pinning
him Indy’s got no leverage Yuri wraps his hands around
Indy’s throat choking him Through clenched teeth

YURI
Sorry about your truck

WHAM Yuri punctuates his line with a pile-driver punch down
into Indy’s face In return

INDY
Sorry about your plutonium

WHAM Indy punctuates that with a pile-driver punch up into
Yuri‘s face Suddenly the other Russians arrive two of them
pinning Indy in the “cockpit” by the shoulders Yuri rises

YURI
The plutonium is fine Fireproof
casing We got what we came for
(off Indy’s look)
All you did was inconvenience me

INDY
(bitterly)
What are pals for

RUSSIAN
(Russian subtitled)
We kill him now

YURI
(Russian subtitled)
Not just yet

Yuri pulls a slender wooden case from his inner pocket opens
it The interior is felt-lined He pulls out a HUGE HYPODERMIC
NEEDLE filled with clear fluid Indy’s eyes go wide

Yuri uncaps the hypo and taps it to clear the bubbles He
bends down preparing to jam the hypo into Indy’s neck

Indy glances at the pull-handle marked “FIRE” With a “what
have I got to lose” look on his face he decide to see what
happens when he pulls it He reaches over yanks it --

-- and is stunned as the rear end of the “cockpit” ignites
with a BLAST OF FLAME and an enormous ROAR The Russians jerk
back in shock Yuri has a startled beat of realization jumps

on Indy -- and they’re both instantly whisked from sight --
WIDER ANGLE

-- as the “cockpit” turns out to be a ROCKET SLED hurtling
along a set of rails Indy and Yuri hang on for dear life as
the sled goes screaming down its track --

EXT HANGAR - NIGHT

-- and EXPLODES through a set of wooden doors into the night
Once clear an even bigger BOOSTER OF FLAME kicks in hurtling
them ever faster Up ahead a section of the outer gate open
automatically heralded by spinning lights They zip through --
EXT DESERT - NIGHT

-- and go blazing down the rails across the desert

ON THE ROCKET SLED

Both men are screaming and holding on The sled goes faster
and faster still everything vibrating like crazy

Yuri tries to pull Indy out of the seat but Indy lands a
sclid punch to the Russian’s nose that flips him over the
back of the sled

Yuris now hanging on by his fingertips his body horizontal
in the slipstream above the ROARING ROCKET FLAME The contrail
is enormous over thirty feet long

Indy manages to twist around in the seat getting properly
positioned Fighting the G-forces every inch of the way he
grabs the safety harness and raises it up to his chest
trying to get it buckled He almost gets it but

With a mighty effort Yuri thrusts his arm forward and loops
it around Indy’s neck Now Indy’s being choked again not to
mention being pulled inexorably out of his seat The Russian’s
howling in his ear both their faces getting plastered back
by sheer G-force

Indy sees the hypo on the floor near his foot He reaches for
it with straining fingers manages to grab it

In danger of being yanked out the sled Indy ships the hypo
up and stabs it repeatedly over his shoulder at Yuri Yuri
keeps avoiding it whipping his head from side to side He
gets Indy’s wrist in an iron grip turning the hypo back on
Indy now straining to jam it into his neck

Indy throws several quick punches over his shoulder with his
free hand popping Yuri in the nose Yuri’s grip on Indy
wrenches loose The hypo falls back into the cockpit as the
Russian drops back again hanging by his fingertips

Indy forces himself back down into his seat He tries again
to buckle his safety harness his hands fighting to overcome
the G-forces He almost gets it but

Suddenly the sled’s booster shuts down Indy is hurled forward

as the gees reverse banging his head off the control panel
and cracking a glass dial Yuri goes sailing over Indys head
thrown clear and vanishing from view The sled comes to a
stop shutting down to complete silence

Groaning Indy sits clutches his bleeding head trying not to
pass out It’s an effort of will but he stays conscious And
just when he looks up --
-- WHAM Yuri sucker-punches him knocking him out as we

FADE TO
EXT DESERT - NIGHT
Indy’s slumped unconscious in the sled blood trickling down
his face A HAND reaches into frame rolls up his sleeve and
jabs him with the HYPODERMIC Indy starts coming to More
hands reach in and grab him hauling him out of the sled

The Russians sit him on the ground Yuri crouches before him
Indy rubs his arm realizing they injected him

INDY
What was in the hypo

YURI
Something to make you cooperate
You have to tell me Indy Who else
knows about this Is my mission at
risk Is a trap being set

INDY
Go piss up a rope

YURI
(checks his watch)
The drug requires a few more
seconds

(sighs)
I regret this has come between us
my friend
INDY

There’s an old American saying
With friends like you

YURI
who needs enemies Yes I have
heard it Sadly true in our case
as it turns out

Indy swoons as the drug kicks in He almost nods out The men
around him prop him up Yuri slaps him to keep him conscious
grabs him by the jaw and looks him in the eye

YURI
Who else knows Or was this just

you being stupid and meddling in
things you shouldn’t

INDY
»-nobody knowsjust me

Yuri nods He knows Indy’s telling the truth Softly

YURI
You should have stuck to digging up
pottery priyatel Any last words

INDY
I love America

Indy passes out and falls back with a THUMP Yuri looks to
his men

YURI
(in Russian subtitled)
Take him with the other one

TWO RUSSIANS are in the car both wearing black trenchcoats
and black hats CAMERA DRIFTS BACK closing on the trunk

eee

IN THE TRUNK

»-where we find Indy painfully coming to He looks around
and discovers he’s lying next to dead professor Avery in his
pale yellow plaid suit Indy feels around in the dark trying
to find a way out of his predicament He finds a shovel and
raises it mind racing for a plan

IN THE CAR
Russian 1 studies a map in the passenger seat

RUSSIAN 1
(in Russian subtitled)
This is it Right here

THE CAR

stops in the middle of nowhere The Russians get out circle
around to the trunk

RUSSIAN 2
(in Russian subtitled)
So we just leave them out here
That doesn’t make sense

RUSSIAN 1
in Russian subtitled)
Orders are orders Dont think
just do as were told

They open the trunkand nothing Just two inert bodies

They reach over Professor Avery and grab Indy first hauling
him out by the arms and legs They stagger about ten feet
from the car and deposit him on the ground

--while bg Professor Avery apparently comes to life and
gets out of the trunk Its Indy wearing the pale yellow

plaid suit and clutching the shovel

The Russians sense movement behind them but too late -- Indy
WHACKS them both with the shovel laying them out flat

Indy looks desperately around trying to get his bearings He
sees something shields his eyes against the sun

ere ti half ile

Indy jumps in the car cranks the engine and peels off
toward the town As the Cadillac dwindles

The Russians painfully come to They stagger to their feet
and realize their car is leaving without them It’s already
several hundred yards away Russian 2 pulls a burp gun from
under his trenchcoat and OPENS FIRE

TRACKING WITH THE CADILLAC

---and the back of the car is TORN UP BY BULLETS Indy ducks
as the rear window blows out and the dashboard gets chewed

up Worst yet the tires blow out

The car slews to a smoking stop steam billowing from the
radiator Indy jumps out He’s halfway to the town

He starts running the rest of the way Far behind him the
Russians are two black specks pursuing him

EXT TOWN - DAY

A prim neat little town of white picket fences Indy comes
running up a street and pauses There’s nobody in sight

INDY
HELLO HELLO HELP

No answer He glances back The Russians are closing Indy
dashes off losing himself between the houses --

NEW ANGLE

-- and he comes around into a backyard as the Russians appear
on the street bg trying to see where he went

The split up Russian 1 comes this way with a pistol in his
hand Indy keeps going right through somebody’s laundry line --

VARIOUS ANGLES

-- and manages to keep one step ahead of his pursuers dodging
them by inches He gets to a back door dashes inside --

INT HOUSE —- DAY

-- and finds himself in a kitchen where he presses up against
a HEAVY-DUTY REFRIGERATOR Russian 1 drifts past the window
outside as Indy holds his breath The Russian moves off

Indy crosses to the archway leading to the dining room

INDY
Hello Anybody

No answer But he’s hearing FAINT MUSIC Somebody’s in the
house It draws him into

A HALLWAY

Indy moves up the hallway as the music grows louder it’s a
bouncy tune from “The Howdy Doody Show”

LIVING ROOM

Indy peeks in A FAMILY is seated with their backs to us
watching “Howdy Doody” on a black and white TV set -- MOM DAD
and TWO KIDS Indy enters in a breathless rush

INDY
Look I’m sorry but it’s an
emergency There are Russian spies
outside in your town right now
and they’re both armed and

Nobodys moved Their attention is riveted to the screen

INDY
Hey What’s wrong with you people

He steps forward and grabs Dad’s shoulder --
NEW ANGLE

-- only to realize Mom and Dad arent “people” -- theyre
ins Indy looks to the kids They’re fake too Blank
lifeless faces stare at the TV screen where

BUFFALO BOB
Why Howdy haven’t you guessed
yet It’s an imaginary place

HOWDY DOODY
Oh boy Let’s have some fun

PUSH IN FOR A TIGHT SWEATY CLOSEUP on Indy Stunned Trying
to process what’s happening Suddenly

AN AIR RAID SIREN STARTS WAILING Indy gazes up listening

INDY
Oh that can’t be good

He runs from the room --
EXT HOUSE - DAY

-- and onto the front lawn A MANNEQUIN MAILMAN is frozen at
the mailbox delivering mail Across the street a MANNEQUIN
PEDESTRIAN is frozen in mid-stride walking a FAKE DOG on a
leash Up the street a GROUP OF MANNEQUIN KIDS are frozen on
their bicycles while a MANNEQUIN DRIVER waves cheerily at them
from behind the wheel of his motionless BUICK On a porch

a MANNEQUIN MOM serves cookies to her MANNEQUIN FAMILY

The SIREN IS WAILING EERILY rising and falling The Russians
appear running into the street to listen faces pale their
mission to kill Indy momentarily forgotten

Indy walks into the street shielding his eyes against the
sun scanning the rooftops CAMERA COMES AROUND revealing

There over the rooftops a few hundred yards out of town
stands a metal-frame TOWER festooned with sirens and
loudspeakers tomention a F OMB

lying in its cradle on the tower platform Suddenly a MALE
VOICE COMES OVER THE LOUDSPEAKERS booming and echoing across

Countdown to detonation is commencing
at t-minus two minutes and counting

Indy and the Russians trade a profound look of “holy shit”

Indy turns and runs out of town The Russians take off after
him hauling ass for all they’re worth to catch up

EXT DESERT - DAY

VOICE (0S)
T-minus one minute twenty seconds

INDY

suddenly stops panting hard knowing this is pointless CAMERA
PUSHES IN as he thinks fast making a desperate decision The
Russians run past him hollering for him to keep going

Instead Indy turns back The Russians are stunned glancing
back over their shoulders as they keep running

Indy bursts in racing through the rooms and up the hallway
dogged by the cheery “Howdy Doody” THEME MUSIC (sung to the
happy tune of “Ta-rara Boom-Der-e”)

Doody time it’s Howdy Doody time”

VOICE (0S)

Indy jumps in the fridge slams the door

VOICE (0S)
T-minus zero

eee CREEN ES WHI’
IN THE INCREDIBLE GLARE SLO-MO AND OVEREXPOSED WE SEE

Mannequins flying apart in the nuclear blast-furnace like
leaves in a gale bodies igniting like match-heads at
flashpoint kids getting swept off their bikes mailman and
pedestrian going airborne and turning to cinders mom and her
cookies sailing away on a wind of white fire the Buick and
its waving driver tumbling down the street like a flaming toy
as walls collapse and roofs fly away

EXT DESERT - DAY

«-- and the AWESOME GLARE SUBSIDES just enough to see

The Russians running A BLASTWAVE OF HEAT AND DEBRIS comes
rocketing across the flats turning sand to glass And in the
instant before the blastwave consumes them the last thing
the Russians see is

A refrigerator zipping past right between them riding the
blastwave

Both Russians are instantly vaporized The blastwave reaches
us and we become engulfedblinded by dust

DISSOLVE TO
EXT DESERT - DAY

«-and the dust billows away to reveal a scorched half-
melted refrigerator lying in a pile of debris

We hear THUMPING from within The latch gives and the door
swings up with a heave Indy emerges unsteady on his feet

INT FORWARD OBSERVATION BUNKER - DAY
while a SOLDIER scans the blast zone with binoculars

SOLDIER
Sir There’s something moving

A GENERAL raises his own binoculars focuses in Softly

GENERAL
Oh my God

EXT DESERT DAY

Indy staggers toward us gazing up with horror and awe CAMERA
COMES AROUND to reveal

Indiana Jones and the MUSHROOM CLOUD The cloud roils higher
ever higher dominating the sky like the Hand of God itself
Indy stands frozen transfixed by the sight
until the SOUND OF ENGINES makes him turn MILITARY VEHICLES
are converging SOLDIERS jumping out and leveling weapons Indy
raises his hands in surrender as we

INT DECONTAMINATION ROOM - DAY

Indy’s in a decontamination shower naked holding onto an
overhead bar while MEN IN RADIATION SUITS scrub him raw

ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal CIA AGENT 1 in a shadowy room
watching through a two-way mirror CIA AGENT 2 appears at his
side

CIA AGENT 2
Who is he

CIA AGENT 1
The luckiest man alive That
refrigerator he hid in was an old
Westinghouse model Lined with
lead

CUT TO
INT INTERROGATION ROOM DAY

Indy exhausted sits pinned in the glare of an low overhead
light in a dark dark room A reel-to-reel TAPE RECORDER spins
slowly on a round table before him He’s surrounded by SEVEN
SHADOWY MEN in suits and ties their faces unseen throughout

INDY
I’ve told you everything

MAN 1
Youve told us nothing Nothing
that makes sense

MAN 2
You expect us to believe you
unknowingly harbored a Russian spy
That you had no part in this

INDY
I tried to stop them

MAN 2
Right By giving them your truck

INDY
Yuri’s broke down that morning They
said it would take three days to get
the part in So he borrowed mine

MAN 1
And that’s when you supposedly
tried to stop them

INDY
Hell yes I tried to stop them
Just ask the scientist -- that little
weasel Quimby Has he talked

MAN 3
He’s in custody And willing to
name you as a conspirator
INDY
What in return for leniency He’s
lying Trying to save his own skin

MAN 4
Unlike you You’re just a patriotic
American A guy who believes the
United States should maintain her
nuclear superiority at all costs
(sees Indy hesitate)
Correct me if I’m wrong

INDY
I’m not sure I’d tie my patriotism
to a belief in nuclear weapons

MAN 5
So you feel the Soviets should
dominate in that area

INDY
I didn’t say that

MAN 5
What are you saying

Indy hesitates again knowing he might be screwed here

INDY
I’m sayingwell I’m not sure
anybody should have the A-bomb I

think we lack the wisdom for that
kind of power

MAN 6
America lacks the wisdom Did I
hear that right

MAN 7
A strong defensive posture is the
policy of the United States
government -- your government Doctor
Jones You’d prefer to see us fall
victim to our enemies

INDY
Am I being charged with something
Aside from surviving a nuclear blast
If so I’d like to invite my lawyer
to the philosophical debate

MAN 3
Charged No Not yet But I wouldn’t
go making plans to leave the country
any time soon if I were you

INDY

Look just call Dean Stalling at my
university Or Senator Tashlin Or
Congressman Freleng he’s known me
since I was a kid oror hell
there are people in your own
organization you can ask They knew
me back in the OSS days during the
war They’1l vouch for me

(leans forward intense)
My reputation is beyond reproach
you understand what Im saying I
have friends

Pause Man 1 his face still unseen approaches the table
and crushes out a cigarette in an ashtray Indy blinks up
trying to see the man’s face but all he gets is a voice

MAN 1
I think youll find Doctor Jones
that you’re wrong about that

CUT TO
EXT MARSHALL UNIVERSITY - MORNING

The trees blaze with color Arriving students and teachers
cross the campus grounds

Indy arrives in an open-top BMW 328 roadster -- definitely a
bachelor’s car and an eclectic one at that He gets out
grabs his briefcase and heads for the main building

aS a BLACK DODGE eases into frame with an FBI AGENT named
McKIMSON at the wheel He’s watching Indy’s every move

Indy glances back glowering fully aware that he’s being
tailed He proceeds into the building as McKimson pulls out a
little black notebook and makes a careful notation

744 am -- Subject arrives MU”
INT DEANS OFFICE - MORNING
Indy leans over DEAN CARL STALLING’S desk
INDY
What do you mean I’m taking a leave of

absence Semester’s just starting

STALLING
Now dont get upset

INDY
You think this is upset This isn’t
even close to upset I’m only at
mildly annoyed and warming up

STALLING
Indiana please Sit down and listen

Indy takes a deep breath With an effort of will he sits
down and presents an air of calm

INDY
I’m listening

STALLING
Are you aware federal agents showed
up here yesterday and ransacked
your office for all your files

INDY
(stunned)
You didn’t stop them Youre dean
of this school they had no right --

STALLING
They had every right These werent
vandals these were grown men with
federal warrants
(beat)
Don’t you understand what’s going
on here Hasn’t it sunk in yet

He slides a NEWSPAPER across to Indy The front page shows a
PHOTO OF INDY under a headline “Local Professor Suspected of
TreasonIS HE RED” Indy absorbs this rocked to his heels

STALLING
The government is building a case
against you And they won‘t stop
until they have one

INDY
So I’m fired Is that it

STALLING
Its a leave of absence Until this
thing blows over

INDY
Ive taught here twenty seven
years Carl I have tenure

STALLING
It’s not my decision It comes from
the Board of Regents They feel
this university cannot be embroiled
in this kind of scandal
(softly)
I‘m sorry My hands are tied

cuT TO

INT INDYS CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER -—- MORNING

STUDENTS have arrived and are just settling in The NEW TEACHER
is chalking his name on the blackboard

TEACHER
My nameis Mr Sullivan

Suddenly Indy appears at the doorway The room goes quiet
He enters slowly Goes to the desk All eyes on him

He opens his briefcase on the desk Starts quietly gathering
his personal items and placing them inside The silence thick

He glances up and sees the faces of his students Their
expressions are anguished Indy clears his throat

INDY

Mr Sullivan will be filling in for
me while Im gone I am certain he is
an excellent teacher and I expect
youll treat him with the same
respect you’ve always treated me

(beat)
My not being here does not excuse
your efforts as regards your studies
In plain English no slacking off
in my absence I can promise you a
typically unforgiving mid-term Mr
Sullivan will see to it

He places a final item in his briefcase latches it He looks
up and realizes that some of his students have tear on their
faces Indy is deeply moved but keeps his voice steady

INDY
It has been my privilege to be your
teacher Good luck

He picks up his briefcase tucks his potted plant under his
arm and heads for the door He stops halfway

TIGHT ON INDY
eand turns back gazing up at his students

INDY

If there’s one thing my father taught
me it’s self-reliance That means
thinking for yourself

(beat)
never let them close your minds
Never be told what to think God
gave you brains for a reason

EXT CAMPUS MUSEUM - NIGHT

The museum fronts a park-like square under a sky full of stars
At first we think the area is deserted but then we hear

INDY (0S)
(drunk singing)

“It happened in Monterey a long

time agooooI met her in

Monterey in old Mexicooo”

Indy enters frame holding a bottle of scotch

INDY
“stars and steel guitars and
luscious lips as red as winebroke
somebody’s heart and Im afraaaid
that it was miiine”

He knocks back a swig HEADLIGHTS suddenly creep into view
bg stopping It’s that black Dodge again

INDY
Oh for cryin’ out loud Let a guy
get pie-eyed in peace willya

IN THE DODGE

Agent McKimson is still keeping tabs on Indy He kills the
engine Through the windshield we see Indy step off the
grass crossing toward the museum

Indy pauses halfway lifts the neck of the bottle like a
microphone and bellows toward the car

INDY
“MY INDISCREET HEARTLOOONGS FOR
THAT SWEETHEARTTHAT I LEFT IN
OLD MONTEREEEEY”

He staggers on vanishing up the museum steps Unflappable
McKimson pulls out his little notebook to make an entry

INT MUSEUM ROTUNDA - NIGHT

Dark and moody with just the night lights glowing We find
Indy moving along the displays admiring them

INDY
I’m telling you Marcus they really
nailed my hide to the wall this
time They took my job Froze my
bank accounts And get this they
want to try me for treason Can you
beat that Treason Me

Indy walks to the center of the rotunda CAMERA BRINGS US
into an OVER-THE-SHOULDER OF SOME UNSEEN PERSON

INDY
Now I ask you does that sound
reasonable I mean really Marcus
have you ever met a more red
white black and blue guy than me

He approaches the figure As he steps close CAMERA COMES
AROUND to reveal a life-size BRONZE STATUE OF MARCUS BRODY
occupying the center of the rotunda It’s a flawless likeness
capturing even the warmth of Marcus’ cocked grin Indy glances
down at the plaque which reads

“MARCUS BRODY -- In Memorium -- 1882-1952”

INDY
(softly)
I sure do miss you pal I wish you
were here right now

Indy turns away wiping the mist from his eyes as he regards
the museum He moves back to the display cases containing
rare and beautiful objects some of which we recognize -- in
fact there’s the Cross of Coronado from “Last Crusade”

INDY

Look at this place Look what we
made of it you and me The effort
that went into these exhibits

(reminiscing from

object to object)
fractured legdislocated
shoulderminor concussion

he stops at the next display which contains a very familiar
item -- the small gold Fertility Goddess from “Raiders”
Lying in the display next to it is Indy’s famous leather
satchel

INDY
I took some lumps getting this one
back huh Half this stuff is ours
pal We paid for ‘em in faith hard
work and broken bones In fact

A booze-fueled idea is forming He tosses Brody a sly look

INDY
«--Im taking ‘em with me

He tries the display case but it’s locked He unhooks a
brass stanchion from its velvet rope picks it up and rams
it right through the glass with a godawful loud CRASH

Indy looks to Brody’s statue puts a finger to his lips

INDY
Sshhhh

He grabs his satchel out first slings it over his neck Then he
reaches in for the idoland stops He notices the Goddess is
sitting on a pressure-sensitive pad -- cued by Indy’s look
CAMERA follows the connected wires across and then up the inside
wall of the cabinet Indy glances up and sees

An ALARM BELL mounted on the wall of the museum up near the
ceiling One of dozens Indy thinks a moment then

A FEW QUICK CUTS

show Indy duplicating his attempt from the opening of
“Raiders” He whips out his handkerchief lays it flat on the
floor Dumps sand into it from a public ashtray Ties the
ends up to make a bag of sand and then we’re back to

THE DISPLAY CASE

Indy pauses judging the weight of the idol by eye As we saw
him do years ago he dumps a little excess sand from the bag
to get the weight just rightand does a smooth switch For
a moment it looks like he made it Indy smiles

»-and then ALL THE BELLS GO OFF He looks up Crap
EXT MUSEUM - NIGHT

McKimson jumps from his car hearing the alarm

INT MUSEUM - NIGHT

Indy stuff the idol into his satchel starts grabbing other
things out of the case Suddenly an ELDERLY BLACK MUSEUM
GUARD named JACKSON comes racing around the corner stunned

JACKSON
Doctor Jones What on earth to you
think you’re doing

Indys abashed like a kid caught stealing

INDY
I uh well I was just

JACKSON
You were just drunk as a monkey I
can smell you from here

(wagging his finger)
Indiana Jones you ought to be
ashamed of yourself What would
your father say

INDY
You’re not gonna tell him are you

JACKSON
Looky here I’m going back down to
the basement and finish my sandwich
and coffee If you’re gone when I get
backand there ain’t a damn thing
missingthen I never saw you

He turns and walks away leaving a very embarrassed Indiana
Jones After a few moments the ALARM TURNS OFF Indy turns
back toward the display case

--and sees Agent McKimson standing outside the glass entry
doors watching Indy gets pissed off all over again

INDY
YOU GONNA WRITE THAT IN YOUR LITTLE
NOTEBOOK

McKimson opens the door steps inside

MCKIMSON
Professor You’re drunk

INDY
Yeah Wanna make something of it

MCKIMSON
If it’s any consolation I don’t
like this any better than you do
Me I think you’re getting a raw
deal but that’s just between us
and off the record

Indy backs down disarmed by the man’s unexpected sympathy

MCKIMSON
You’re in no condition to drive
Can I offer you a ride home

Indy thinks it over this unexpected kindness making him feel
ashamed of himself He nods

INDY
Yeah That’d be swell Thanks

---and CRACK small hole aj si lass door behin
Agent McKimson He goes stiff eyes wide with surprise For a

brief moment Indy has no idea what’s happening

eand then he gets the shock of his life as McKimson drops
from frame revealing

The Thin Man outside the glass doors We’d know this guy

anywhere We saw him at the plutonium exchange Death in a
homburg hat Dressed all in black Rat-thin face with a long
scar bisecting a milky dead eye He’s got a SILENCED PISTOL
smoking in his hand an old-fashioned broom-handled Mauser

The Thin Man FIRES again putting another hole through the
glass as Indy ducks and runs

The thin Man runs at the doors FIRING the glass granulating
and collapsing to the floor from the door frame He leaps in
through the sudden “entrance” aiming after Indy

He SHOOTS The bullet PINGS off the Brody statue as Indy runs
past it The Thin Man takes off in pursuit

INDY

races through the darkened museum instantly sober from
adrenaline and panic SILENCED GUNSHOTS are whining past his
head punching holes through glass displays and obliterating
precious artifacts Indy cries out each time a museum piece
EXPLODES near him horrified to see them destroyed

A BULLET ZINGS by him and shatters the leg of a table up ahead
upon which sits a priceless HAN DYNASTY VASE The vase topples --

-- and Indy dives to the floor sliding on his stomach with
arms outstretched The vase falls perfectly into his grasp as
he skids to a stop He sets the vase delicately on floor --

-- and a bullet WHIZZES past his ear and BLASTS the vase to
smithereens Shit He lunges to his feet and keeps running

THE THIN MAN

reloads his pistol on the run Indy darts around a corner up
ahead The Thin Man follows and finds

The back exit doors are chained There’s only one other door
in sight He jerks it open darts through it gun-first

INT MUSEUM CLOCK TOWER - NIGHT

-and glances up hearing FOOTSTEPS ECHOING to silence above
The Thin Man takes the stairs three at a time

INT BELL ROOMTOP OF TOWER - NIGHT
--and he edges into view from below Shadows everywhere

Large open archways face out on two sides to the night air
THO HUGE GLASS CLOCK FACES occupy the other two walls big
gears and cogs turning slowly Light filters through the milky
glass throwing shadows of Roman numerals and clock hands

Eerie LIFE-SIZED BRONZE GODS AND GODDESSES are arrayed on a
complex system of circular tracks -- Zeus Apollo Neptune Mars
Aphrodite -- a dozen in all poised to bang the bells with their
implements (Neptune has a trident Thor has a hammer)

The Thin Man glides like a shadow straining for any sign of
his quarry He thinks he hears a rustle in the darkness

He glances down to see the tips of Indy’s shoes poking out
from behind an upright beam He edges closer as the clock

gears turn seconds away from midnight Softly

THIN MAN
(softly)
Cmon pally Let’s not drag this
out

The Thin Man darts around the beam to shoot -- only Indy‘s
not there It’s just his shoes

The CLOCK STRIKES MIDNIGHT and the clockwork gods jerk and
rumble to life The Thin Man gasps and spins around whipping
his aim at the sudden movement

The bronze figures are turning on their track and BANGING out
the preamble melody on a series of bells the room filling
with sound and moving shadows

--eand we catch a glimpse of a “god” wiping through a spill
of light as the figures come around -- it’s Indy arm cocked

WHAM Indy lands an awesome punch The thin Man loses his gun
and goes flying skidding flat on his backbut springs forward
straight up off his back and lands on his feet like a cat

Indy grabs a mop handle brandishing it Not missing a beat
the Thin Man twirls around snatches a passing sword from Mars
the God of War and cleaves Indy’s weapon at mid-point on the
floor through dy’s lenly j holdi hort st

The killer comes at Indy with a wicked flurry of sword moves
Indy barely avoids being gutted ducking and dodging stumbling
onto the moving track and using the bronze figures for cover

The fight becomes a deadly dance between Indy the Thin Man
and the moving clockwork figures both men ducking mechanical
limbs and implements (or getting clobbered by them) as the
battle moves down the automated track

EXT CLOCK TOWER - NIGHT

wae out rou loor indin ound the o ide of e

in a stranglehold trying to force him over the side

Grimacing Indy manages to shove the Thin Man into the path of
Thor’s hammer as it swings WHACK The assassin gets smacked in
the head as the mechanical track carries them back inside

INT CLOCK TOWER - NIGHT
-and the men are hurled to the floor as the rig lurches to

a stop And now the truly deafening part begins -- the HUGE
MAIN BELL STARTS TOLLING THE HOUR as

The Thin Man sees his gun lying on the floor where he dropped
it earlier He scrambles for it

Indy knows he can never get there in time Thinking fast he
yanks the Fertility Goddess from his satchel

THE THIN MAN

snatches up the gun and spins around to shoot - -but the

ility go izzes thr ir and
nails him right between the eyes THUNK The impact sends him

flying back CRASHING through

THE HUGE CLOCK FACE

It disintegrates spectacularly as the Thin Man explodes through
it plummeting in a rain of glass -

EXT ROOF - NIGHT

heayily o e roof be The roof is peaked and

clay-tiled steep angles descending on either side The killer
loses his gun -- the Mauser pistol goes slidingclattering
down the steep roof tiles vanishing from sight

The Thin Man pushes to his feet balancing on the peakas
Ss onto the roof ind him The killer whips around
but Indy nails him with a mighty punch that bleodies his noes

Thin Man snarls and lands a karate kick to Indy’s stomach

that doubles him over Indy backpedals almost losing his
balance as his enemy presses the attack with a series of scary
martial arts moves -- the guys a friggin’ karate expert To
make things worse it’s all happening with both men trying
like crazy to keep their balance on the peak of the roof

indy gets driven to his knees The killer lunges -- but Indy
hi rolls back using the momentum to vault the

Thin Man over his head The killer flips through the air
slams hard onto the sloping tile and start to slide down

-but he gr Indy’s s t and 1shi 0

The two men go sliding down the roof like an out-of-control
ride down a water slide the Thin Man dragging Indy Indy
folliwing headfirst on his stomach going airborne as they
hit a gable and sail over it like skiers hitting a ramp
slamming back down and suddenly there’s the thin Man’s gun
lying on the tiles and he grabs it as they sail past and
holy crap here com t dge of wee

EDGE OF THE ROOF

-and the thin Man sails off into space -- but Indy jams to
an at t r s edge holdin oO the

The Thin Man finds himself penduluming over a horrible drop to
the pavement far below Indy clutching him by one hand The
killer aims his gun up at Indy A look passes between them

INDY
Shooting me right now would be a

really bad idea

The Thin Man hates to admit it but Indy’s right He drops
the Mauser to free up his hand then reaches up and grabs
hold of Indy’s wrist trying to hold on Hes slipping

INDY
Why are you trying to kill me

THIN MAN
You’re a loose end People I work
for don’t like loose ends
(slips a bit more)
My hands are sweaty Grab my sleeve

Indy shifts his grip to the man’s coat sleeve grabbing it
with both hands The killer’s fingers are clawing at the edge
of the roof tile trying to get a grip

THIN MAN
Cmon pally Pull me up

INDY
Give me a reason

Suddenly -- xrrrriiiippp The Thin Man glances to the side
The seam of his coat is giving way at the shoulder Slowly

THIN MAN
Pull me up I tell ya I’11 spill
everything I’1l rat out the
Russkies Ill clear ya I swear I
will Just pull me up For the love’a

Mike pull me up

Indy’s trying straining with all his might He’s pulling the
Thin Man slowly but surely higher and higher

The killer’s face rises up into view He’s got his hand on
the tiles now desperately getting some traction moments
away from defeating gravity and being pulled to safety

-and his coat sleeve tears off There’s a horrible look of

realization in his eyes a gasp of startled terror as he
falls back and vanishes from view

THE THIN MAN

free-falls away from camera screaming arms and legs
windmilling clay tiles plummeting in his wake

ON THE ROOF

-and Indy hears a DISTANT THUMP He crawls to the edge and
peers over an empty coat sleeve flapping in his hand

TIME CUT

Indy steps up to the thin Man’s body He goes to his knees
searching the man’s pockets All he finds is a tiny key the

kind that goes to a public locker The locker number is stamped

WIPE TO
INT INDY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

An old battered suitcase hits the bed It’s covered with
countless stickers from exotic locales -- Cairo Sumatra
Tibet Lisbon Prague Pismo Beach

The latches are thrown and the lid swung up Inside sprinkled
with mothballs are a familiar LEATHER JACKET crumpled FEDORA
BULLWHIP and GUN The leather satchel is tossed in joining
its companions ANGLE UP to Indy his expression intense

He spins to his dresser and yanks the drawers completely out
dumping their contents into the suitcase Suddenly

The lights come on Indy turns sees his father in the doorway
Henry Sr is in his robe blinking sleepily

HENRY
What time is it

INDY

Indy keeps tossing stuff into his suitcase like a madman His
father moves into the room eyeing him

HENRY

INDY

HENRY

INDY

These charges of treason outrage me
to the marrow of my bones Theyre
a disgrace to everything we hold

You mustn’t run away

INDY
No Watch me

Beat Henry stuns Indy with a hard slap

HENRY
It appears there’s a reason you’re
named after the dog

Indy raises his hand to his face tears stinging his eyes

INDY
A man tried to kill me tonight An
assassin sent by the Russians

HENRY
Dear Godwell we must alert the
authorities You need protection
This surely proves your innocence

INDY
He killed an FBI agent The one
tailing me They’re gonna think I
did it You know where that puts
me The electric chair

Suddenly FLASHING RED LIGHTS play across the curtains We
hear TIRES SCREECH to a stop car doors SLAM police radios
SQUAWK Events are spiraling out of control fast

Henrys torn lost reeling with guilt for the slap He
throws his arms around Indy in a desperate fatherly embrace

HENRY
Junior Forgive me

Indy melts in his father’s arms for a moment

HENRY
-but I can’t let you run I wont
You’11 only prove them right

then he recoils angrily pulling free and shoving his father
off his feet into a chair He grabs his suitcase off the bed

damn sure he isn’t being watched inserts the key

ANGLE FROM INSIDE THE LOCKER

and swings the door open Indy’s sunned at what he finds
inside It’s a BOWLING BALL BAG with tartan sides The same
one Yuri handed off to the Thin man at the military base
Lying next to it is a HOTEL ROOM KEY with a plastic tag Indy
reaches in grabs them

He watches with keen interest as Indy enters the hotel

And its empty He does a quick search just to make sure
grabs the bags in from the hallway slams the door He slots
the security chain for good measure

He brings the blowing ball bag to a table regards it with
deep wonder and suspicion What the hell could be inside He
pulls up a chair gets himself ready for the big moment

He grabs a paperclip straightens it picks the lock The bag
is stuffed with crumpled newspaper He reaches in feeling
around growing more puzzled as his fingers find something he
can’t identify He pulls it out revealing

A CRYSTAL SKULL

Perfectly formed life-sized smoother than glass kicking
light like a giant diamond orb At first glance it would appear
to be the world’s most exotic art object

INDY

recognizes it instantly for what it is a thrill going through
him From his expression it’s a rare object indeed Softly

INDY
Skull of Destiny My God
(raises it reluctantly)
What on earth do the Russians want
with you

He gazes into its eyes in wonder deeply drawn by it getting
lost in its depths Reflected light is kicking into his eyes
the effect proving hypnotic and suddenly the daylight in the
room seems to grow dimmer as the traffic noise FADES AWAY
and now the skull seems to be glowing from within getting
brighter as all sound vanishes except for an EERIE HARMONIC
HUM building from the netherworld pulling Indy into an ever
greater trance ensnaring him in the skull’s seductive curves
and facets and the room is gone now except for Indy and the
skull blazing like a beacon in his hands and what before was
merely reflected light from the skull‘s surface now resolves
into purposeful twin beams emanating from the skull’s empty
eye sockets into Indy’s eyes his gaze helplessly locked now
with the skulls and we begin to hear TERRIFYING WHISPERS
GUTTURAL INHUMAN VOICES speaking in strange tongues and --

-- BAMBAMBAM Somebody’s POUNDING at the door Indy snaps
out of it everything back to normal the daylight the CARS
HONKING outside the shabby room

He recoils from the skull reeling from the experience his
face drenched with sweat What the hell just happened He
sets it on the table grabs his revolver goes to the door

INDY
Who is it

Indy cracks the door open with the chain still on Reggie
Nalder the gangster from the car peers in at him

REGGIE

Indy nonplussed unchains the door Reggie saunters in sees
the gun

REGGIE

INT HOTEL BARNIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Food and drinks are being served A LATIN JAZZ COMBO fronted
by a FEMALE VOCALIST performs on a tiny stage (the source of
the music we heard up in Indy’s room)

Indy crosses the room toward the bar checking out the
occupants They in turn check him out Never have we seen a
more nefarious bunch It looks like we raided the supporting
cast of a Michael Curtiz movie

A FAT MAN wearing a fez and smoking a hookah nods to Indy as
he goes by An UNSHAVEN PERUVIAN with an eyepatch and a MACAW
on his shoulder throws him a suspicious glance Some EASTERN
EUROPEANS playing cards give him a glowering once-over

Any of these people could be Indy’s contact From appearances
they’re all spies Indy sits at the bar under a slow-turning
ceiling fan his back to the room The BARTENDER appears

INDY
Martini por favor

As the drink is made Indy tosses a subtle glance or two
trying to guess which one of these rogues will approach him

while behind him far bg a WOMAN enters the lobby We’re
too far away to see her face and in any event she’s obscured
by a stylish wide-brimmed hat that matches her white tailored
skirt suit Whoever she is she’s got a sensational figure
She steps to the front desk speaking to the concierge --

FRONT DESK
-- and the concierge responds with a nod pointing

CONCIERGE
The gentleman you seek is at the
bar

She nods her thanks CAMERA FOLLOWS her into the barnightclub
and across the room We still don’t see her face but she’s
certainly drawing her share of stares -- she’s too classy for
the joint and gives off the air of a femme fatale (The band
should be playing something hot and smoky during this walk)

She comes up behind Indy as the bartender sets down his
martini She makes her presence known by plucking an olive
with a white-gloved hand and dropping it in Indy’s drink

Indy turns looking up at her A frozen beat His expression
going slack For a moment his brain refuses to accept what
he’s seeing it’s literally the last person he ever expected

REVERSE ANGLE

reveals MARION RAVENWOOD She looks fantastic not to mention
dumbstruck at the sight of Indy her smile fades

--and s of imin th th Indy flies
off his stool and lands on his ass

MARION
What the hell are you doing here

INDY
What the hell you hitting me for

MARION
I told you if I ever saw your face
again Id pop you one

Indy grabs the tool hauling himself off the floor

INDY
That was twelve years ago You got
a long memory lady

MARION
Yeah too long I still remember
you don’t I

Indy rises to his feet swaying a bit She gets ready to punch
him again but he lifts his hand to ward her off

INDY
You said youd pop me one not two
A lady always keeps a promise

MARION
You didnt answer my question

INDY
I’m meeting somebody It could be
dangerous I’d love to stand here
and reminisce but you have to

This is extortion

INDY
Absolutely

MARION

Cuidad de Los Dioses

(off his look)
That’s right We’re going after the
Lost City of the Gods

INDY
(laughs)
Los Dioses That city’s not lost
it never existed It’s a myth A
fable

MARION
Oh yeah Where do you think the
skull came from smart guy

Indy eyes her dubiously as she pours another drink
INDY
Sounds like hooey to me

MARION
It’s not There was a failed
expedition about three year ago

INDY
(taken aback)
The Oxley expedition

MARION
That’s the one Figured you’d heard
of it Oxley was a friend of your
father’s wasn’t he

INDY
Yeah Guy was like an uncle to me
Broke my old man’s heart when they
disappeared without a trace

MARION
Not entirely without a trace A year
after they vanished a lone survivor
staggered out of the jungle into
some remote village How he survived
that long in the wold is anybodys
guess but I hear the poor guy’s
mind was gone Word is he wound up
in an insane asylum

INDY
A survivor You sure

MARION
It wasn’t Oxley if that’s what
youre thinking Just some bearer
Point is he was carrying the skull
when they found him It’s been
changing hands ever since Wasn’t
easy to track down Or cheap Cost
us a small fortune

INDY
Who’s “us” Who’s involved in this
cockeyed mess

MARION
Baron Peter Belasko The famous

archeologist I’m sure youve heard of

him

INDY

heard of him He’s that dilettante
who writes bestsellers Let me tell

you somethingfor centuries
people have gone after Los Dioses
and died trying That’s ‘cause it
ain’t real It’s a fairytale If
this Belasko’s going for it he’s a
lunatic He’s dangerous Do not
trust him In fact stay as far
away from him as possible

MARION
Thatll be a little hard to do

She raises her left hand revealing her WEDDING RING

MARION
Since hes my husband

This hits Indy hard He turns away shaking he head in wonder

INDY

I can’t believe it After all that
talk about your father dragging you
all over the world after all that
talk about me

(turns back)
-after all that belly-aching you
went and married an archeologist

MARION

character thanks to you

INDY

As they walk away Indy throws an uncomfortable glance over
his shoulder and sees Turner starting at him Escalante leads
them to a waiting PHOTOGRAPHER who has a BELLOWS CAMERA on a
tripod a lighting set-up and a seamless backdrop

INDY
Please Mr President you first

Indy and Marion are herded before the lens looking stiff
and uncomfortable together Indy’s distracted scanning the

He spots a certain photo of a DISTINGUISHED OLDER MAN and
directs her attention to it muttering

INDY

INT BALLROOM - DAY (TIMECUT)

-- AND THE FLASH DIES AWAY as a CHORUS LINE OF FEMALE DANCERS
come trooping out along a runway launching into a Broadway-
style tap routine as the audience APPLAUDS ANGLE DRIFTS PAST
THE ORCHESTRA to find Indy and Marion seated at a banquet
table Indy poring over his books and map

INDY
Okay I’m remembering this right In
the early 16th Century a pair of
Jesuits attached to Pizarro’s
expeditioin found what they claimed
was Los Dioses -- the Lost City of
the Gods in the Valley of Dreams
They said it was a place where wishes
became real Of course they were
insane by the time they stumbled out
of the jungle All they had to back
up their story was the gold they
were carryingand a crystal skull
That skull’s on private display in
the Vatican museum

MARION
There’s more than one Twelve that
I know of

INDY

--right the Mitchell-Hedges skull
the one in the British Museum some
in private collections

(looks to her)
and now your skull Lucky thirteen
How’d you get your hands on it

Indy’s tone is casual but it’s a weighted question -- he
knows Russian spies are involved but wants to see if Marion
has any idea She just shrugs

MARION
We went through that antiquities
broker in Marrakesh Same guy who
hired you

OSGOOD TURNER
hovers in an alcove speaking urgently on a PHONE

TURNER
---yes I’m looking at him right

And now my friends the

A FRESH LINE OF PEOPLE are trooped out all men They turn to
face the audience like a row of beauty pageant contestants

---aS Marion reaches across Indy to his map of Peru
(Unnoticed by them the line of men on stage are having
nooses lowered around their necks as the orchestra plays
jauntily on)

MARION
Peters got the team assembled and
waiting for us
(points on map)
«-there Soon as we get our papers
signed I’ve got a plane waiting

INDY
A plane good Legend has it the
Jesuits found the Lost City by
following the “lines in the earth”
left by the gods as a map
Professor Oxley once told my father
he thought the “lines in the earth”
meant the Nazca Lines

The orchestra tapers off as a DRUMROLL BEGINS Indy points on
the map draws his finger along their proposed route

INDY
That’s along our route I say we
fly over them If Oxley was right
they could point the way

MARION
I thought you didn’t believe in
this lost city stuff

INDY
I don’t That doesn’t mean Im
always right

They glance up just as the DRUMROLL ENDS and --

they are hung APPLAUSE from the audience Tndy and Marion a
just sit there with their jaws open aghast as

ESCALANTE
So much for our communist rebels
eh Come enjoy

The orchestra strikes up again Couples take to the dance
floor Escalante spots Marion smiles and waves He approaches
their table pulling a pen from his pocket

Renaldo glances back in panic as bullets SHRED the tail He
throws the stick hard left banking away Behind them

Yuri’s plane is smaller and more nimble -- hi zips and swerves
staying on our heroes’ tail MACHINE GUN BLAZING

MARION
Why are they shooting at us

She pulls out her expedition papers and waves them wildly at
the pursuing plane elbowing Indy in the face

MARION
WE HAVE PERMISSION

Indy grabs the top of Marion’s head and shoves her down out of
sight trying to get her out of the line of fire He pulls his
revolver turns and starts FIRING The enemy plane swerves

to avoid his shots

MASSIVE GREEN MOUNTAINS loom in on either side as the terrain
goes from desert to jungle Renaldo veers out over an endless
vista of rain forest with the enemy plane hot on his heels

Marion keeps trying to rise but Indy keeps shoving her back
down He shakes the spent cartridges from his revolver
accidentally sending one down the back of her neck

MARION
Ow dammit that’s hot

-- and he frantically re-loads a painfully slow process of
inserting each bullet individually Marion watches with growing
amazement and irritation

MARION
I know what I’m buying you for
Christmas
(off his look)
---A TOMMY GUN

He slaps the cylinder shut and twists around trying to draw
a bead on the pursuit plane

-finally giving Marion a chance to pop back up She’s just

in time to witness MACHINE GUN BULLETS chew holes up the length
of the lower wing Worse yet the outermost WOODEN STRUTS
connecting upper and lower wings get chopped in half severing
them The upper wing is no longer anchored -- the outer half

is flexing up CREAKING threatening to give way entirely

MARION

Indy The wing’s gonna tear off
INDY

Cover me Keep those bastards off

our tail
Indy slaps the gun into Marion’s hand along with extra bullets
He heaves himself from his seat balancing crazily on the
edge of the cockpit leans forward grips the upper wing
and swings himself onto the bottom wing grabbing the
upright struts to keep from being swept off He looks back
and sees the enemy plane moving in for the kill

but Marion levels the revolver over the back of the cockpit
and lets ‘em have it BLAM BLAMIBLAM

YURI’S PLANE

takes a few bullet hits Yuri veers off

MARION

lets out a laugh of triumph cracks the cylinder and starts
to reload as

INDY

wing-walks between the struts wind tearing at his clothes
He hears a horrible LOUD CRUNCH ahead He looks up and sees

The upper wing now buckling severely up about to shear off
Indy unspools his bullwhip and CRACKS it forward twining the
ni fi fir He heaves down on
the wing and steps close desperately wrapping the upper and
lower struts with the whip threading them together

MARION

finishes reloading as Yuri’s plane reappears with Angel FIRING
the machine gun Marion ducks the gunfire but drops the
pistol Luckily it falls into the cockpit Unluckily the
cockpit is really tight and she has to go down after it

Angel’s ammo runs dry He hurries to reload bringing up a
new box and struggling to pop the lid while

INDY

finishes his repair turns backand sees Marion gone He
looks in horror at the pursuit plane totally exposed

our heroes’ plane to tatters Renaldos reaction is to panic
and throw the bi-plane into a steep dive This has two results

One Indy loses his balance falls flat on the wing and slides
clean off -- but manages to grab a vertical wing strut

The gun slides away from Marion’s fingers skidding down
the floor of the fuselage toward Renaldo’s feet

MARION
Damn it Renaldo

trailing in the slipstream He looks back as

Yuri maneuvers in again closer and closer propeller cutting
the air like the world’s biggest meat slicer Indy gulps -- it
is the world’s biggest meat slicer and he’s the meat

Renaldo starts zigging and zagging Yuri zigs and zags along
right behind them sticking close propeller whipping from
side to side and missing Indy’s legs by inches on every pass

Indy’s getting whipped around in the slipstream like a human
rag helpless He can’t hold on much longer -- besides the
strut he’s clutching ins starting to crack under his fingers

He glances back at the enemy plane getting an idea born of
sheer desperation He knows his timing must be perfect or

hell die and he waits for the right moment when Renaldo
zigs and Yuri zags and that’s when Indy lets go --

YURI‘S PLANE

letting his momentum and the rushing wind spin him around
toward the pilot’s cockpit --

- where he lands an awesome PUNCH to Yuri’s face Yuri is
knocked senseless for a moment head snapping back as the
plane starts to drift

Indy looks to the astonished Angel who’s finally gotten the
ammo box open and is just finishing reloading Angel racks
the feet bolt and swings the machine gun around to shoot

-but Indy’s already scrambling over Yuri to the rear cockpit
WHAM Indy lands another solid PUNCH this one rocking Angel’s
head around The machine gun swings wildly and FIRES --

slumps head dropping down -

She’s coming to looking around She glances over and sees

Indy on the other plane trading punches with Angel She blinks
in confusion - how the hell did he get over there

And then it dawns on her She looks forward heart in her

Yuri gathers his wits and glances back sees Indy and Angel
swapping punches Yuri furious decides theres one simple
way to solve this problem H -rolls the pl ide-
down flying inverted

Both combatants fall Angel plummets away SCREAMING but Indy
Manages to grab the machine gun mount and hold on Yuri looks
back and sees Indy dangling there Shit

INDY
WHAT’S SO SPECIAL ABOUT THE SKULL
YURI WHY DO YOU WANT IT SO BAD

YURI
GIVE IT TO ME AND MAYBE I’LL LET
YOU LIVE

INDY

FOR OLD TIME’S SAKE HELL WITH YOU

Pissed Yuri snap-rolls the plane upright again causing Indy
to plop into the rear cockpit Indy sits up Yuri pulls a
PISTOL turns around to shoot him --

ide—di Yuri falls out SCREAMING The last we
see of him he’s freefalling toward the jungle below

Indy snap-rolis the plane rightside-up again with a no big
deal” look on his face Apparently hes become an expert
pilot since “Temple of Doom”

Indy looks around sees Marion’s plane way the hell down there
He rolls his plane into a steep dive to catch up with her

MARION‘S PLANE

is pretty much shot to pieces by now flying via miracle
sputtering and trailing smoke Worse yet were still ina
steady dive toward the jungle below Marions tugging on her
stick trying to pull it back but the weight of Renaldo’s
body on his stick is preventing her

Indy’s plane zooms in from above matching her dive as he
shouts at the top of his lungs

INDY
PULL UP PULL UP

MARION
I WOULD IF THERE WERENT A DEAD GUY
ON THE STICK

INDY
WELL TRY HARDER

He points frantically at the jungle below -- there’s a lot of
green rushing up to meet us

Marion braces her feet on the instrument panel straining
with all her might The stick begins to move Renaldos body
flops back as the stick rises

and her plane levels out just above the trees heading
s ht for iff

INDY
HARD LEFT HARD LEFT

Marion throws the stick hard left making an extreme 180 degree
turn with Indy on her tail

Both planes level out (back in the direction they came) sailing
along some ten or twenty feet above the jungle canopy -- it’s
scary and spectacular a rollercoaster ride without the rails

MARION

LOOK EITHER DO IT OR DIE ARGUING

He points She looks and sees a RIDGE OF SHEER GRANITE rising
out of the jungle dead ahead She hastily reaches behind the
seat to retrieve the skull Indy starts easing the plane in --

- but his attention suddenly snaps ahead as he sees

Yuri toward the trees b rachute with a B

they go ripping by him EMPTYING THE CLIP into Indy’s engine
Then he drops into the trees gone

Beat Indy leans to one side and peers ahead at the engine

which seems to be doing fine -- ntir
abruptly BURSTS INTO FLAMES Indy looks over to Marion
INDY

NEVER MIND I‘LL COME TO YOU

Marion nods frantically The granite ridge is looming Nursing
the last few seconds of life from his flaming engine Indy
drops altitude his wheels now kissing the treetops

and he veers under Marion With mere moments to spare he
reaches up and grabs hold of her landing gear as his plane
drops out from under him leaving him dangling

The abandoned plane impacts nose-first into the trees below his
feet cartwheeling through a spectacular fiery disintegration

INDY
PULL UP UUUUP

Marion heaves back on the stick with all she’s got fighting
for every inch of altitude For a moment it doesnt look like
they’re going to make it but they do clearing the ridge by
mere feet Unfortunately the ridge proves to be --

A JUNGLE PLATEAU

- where Marion’s plane is suddenly chewing through the
treetops like a hedge trimmer with wings

INDY

is holding on desperately to the landing gear getting swept
relentlessly through the branches SWARMS OF MONKEYS are
shrieking and jumping out of the way

THUMP Indy looks down and finds a SHRIEKING MONKEY clinging
in terror to his chest and screaming in his face Indy SCREAMS
back equally startled The monkey jumps for it vanishing
back into the trees as

The plateau suddenly drops away and the plane soars out over
a thousand-foot drop with Indy still holding on

MARION
wrestles the stick looking frantically over the sides

MARION

A trembling hand appears at the edge of the forward cockpit
followed by a second hand Indy’s face rises up looking like
he’s been dragged down ten miles of bad road Marion lights
up with a cocky grin exceedingly proud of herself

MARION
Hah Not bad flying for one lesson
huh Jones

INDY

The monkey pooped on my chest

She doesn’t understand what that means and he’s too tired to
explain He hauls himself painfully over the side into
Renaldo’s cockpit tosses a glance back over his shoulder

INDY
Ill take it from here

huge wooden propeller Stops

INDY
Oh perfect

--and they drop from frame like a brick
VARIOUS ANGLES

Indy wrestles the plane in a dead glide dropping fast
desperately looking for a place to set down He dead-sticks
it toward a clearing trying to line up for a landing

INDY
Hang on

The landing gear tears off as they clip a tree and belly-skid
in The wings are ripped off by passing tree trunks then the
plane finally comes to a stop All things considered it’s a
pretty damn good landing Indy looks stunned that he pulled it
off He tosses a cocky smile over his shoulder at Marion

but she points He turns forward to see FLAMES ERUPTING
from the engine A mad scramble He leaps from his cockpit

INDY
Quick The skull

She tosses him a knapsack and jumps down They race away from
the plan and

BOOM The plane EXPLODES sending a FIREBALL into the sky and
knocking them both flat on their faces Marion pries her nose
off the ground looks back at the plane It’s an inferno

MARION
I suppose we can walk from here

INDY
(facedown muffled)
That might work If the compass and
map weren’t in the plane

Indy rolls painfully onto his back barely able to move He
sees his whip lying within reach in a tangle of wing wreckage
He snags it with his fingers pulls it toward him groaning
with each little movement

MARION
What’s the matter Jones Mileage
finally catching up with you

INDY
It ain’t the mileage sweetheart
It’s the years

This gets a faint trace of a smile from her -- in spite of
everything there’s still a tiny spark here But her smile
vanishes as she gets furious

MARION
Who the hell were those guys Why
were they shooting at us

INDY
You really telling me you dont know
anything about these Russian spies

MARION
Russian spies Are you insane Damn
it Indy what have you got me into

INDY

explain that

The “conversation” escalates into a shouting match as

MARION
Oh please Don’t shift blame Things
were fine until you showed up--

INDY
-yeah I didn’t hear you complaining
when I saved your life five times
in ten minutes-

MARION
--yeah well my life wouldn‘t need
saving if it wasn’t for you Don’t
take credit for putting out the
fire you started--

INDY

PETER

VON GRAUEN
I saw their forced landing I was

PETER
My deepest thanks Herr Doktor

Rebels most likely They would
love to sabotage us and embarrass

My word I’ve heard a lot about you

INDY
Nothing good I’m sure

PETER
On the contrary my wife speaks
very highly of you

Indy tosses a surprised glance at Marion

MARION
He’s being polite

PETER

Nonsense I know you by reputation
as well I’ve read your published
work I’m surprised to have you join
us to say the least

(shakes his hand)
--but honored Now please whats
this about Russian spies

INDY
Seems theyre trying to get their

pressed to say what they want with

Indy opens the knapsack and watches carefully for a reaction
Peter peers in exhilarated doesn’t miss a beat

PETER
Power of course Perhaps beyond
imagining

Seems we’ve attracted the wrong
kind of attention

Porfi nods respectfully to Indy

PORFI
Anything else Senior

INDY
Double the guard tonight No sense
taking chances

Porfi nods and hurries off hollering in Spanish as

most about rope It is the love
that binds

He playfully tosses the noose like a lasso WHIP-PAN with the
noose as it flies and snags an INCAN STATUE -- revealing Yuri
standing before Escalante flanked by armed SOLDIERS

YURI
This expedition of theirs stands to
gain more than you could ever guess
It’s not about stones and trinkets
It’s about the balance of world power

ESCALANTE
You think I am unaware That I have
no resources of my own

Yuri is taken aback -- this comes as news Escalante reels in
his noose and tosses it again snagging a soldiers’s rifle

ESCALANTE
You amuse me A communist spy
captured on my soil wishing to
strike a bargain Give me one good
reason I should not have you killed

YURI

You lack my knowledge The stakes
are high and you have much to gain

PETER
I give you the Skull of Los Dioses

GASPS are heard We’re in a large camp clearing surrounded by
tents campfires torchlight Porfi’s men patrolling with
rifles pause in dread at the sight of the skull Several of
the guards cross themselves Von Grauen’s Hovitos drop to
their knees muttering in superstitious awe

An eerie commotion briefly draws Indy’s attention to a TRUCK
parked in shadow among the other vehicles The back of the
truck is a large square covered with a tied-down tarp -- a
cage perhaps From under the tarp comes ANIMAL MOANS of fear
seemingly triggered by the appearance of the Skull

Along with Indy Marion and Von Graven the expedition team
members are HAMA a Japanese map expert LARS a Swedish
psychic and HIMMELMAN a Swiss anthropologist All regard
the Skull with reverence and awe voices hushed

MARION
Its beautiful And horrible

Lars approaches and holds his hands up to the Skull -- not
touching it but rather “feeling” its emanations

LARS
It wishes to make contact The
psychic vibrations are strong

INDY
“Psychic vibrations” Is this
science or a seance

PETER
Perhaps both Indiana I hold in my
hand the most mysterious object in
all antiquity One which defies all
reason and logic

Himmelman steps up using his pince-nez as a magnifying glass

HIMMELMAN
Do you know why Doctor Jones

INDY
If it’s like the other skulls it’s
shaped from a single piece of quartz
crystal using methods unknown to us
even today It’s cut against the
grain which is impossible without
shattering the quartz And there’s
no trace of tool marks or sanding
even under a microscope

PETER
So by any standards of modern
science these skulls cannot exist
And yet they do Fashioned how By
whom And for what purpose

INDY
Look 111 admit it’s strangebut
that doesn’t mean it’s haunted

PETER
No

Peter crouches before Indy and raises the Skull The other
team members are gathering closer as

PETER
Can you honestly say you havent
felt its hypnotic power Can you
truly say you wouldn’t give
everything to know what ancient
secrets lie within

INDY
Would you

PETER
Indiana we are men of science We
would gladly clasp hands and jump
into hell if that were the pride of
knowledge Tell me I’m wrong

Indy can’t bring himself to deny it He glances uncomfortably
at Marion who gives him a wry look

MARION
I knew you two would hit it off

By now the group is clustered around like kids telling ghost
stories at a campfire the Skull weaving a spell on them all

PETER
And where science fails us are we
not left with legend

WE FOLLOW the skull as it gets passed around everybody getting
their turn to feel it faces exhilirated in the firelight as

INDY

The legend says there are thirteen
skulls in all fashioned by the
gods as they lay dying And that
when all the skulls are brought
together again the gods will be
reborn and reward mankind with all
the knowledge of the universe

The Skull is passed to

VON GRAUEN
you missed the most important part of
the legend Doctor Jones They say
the Lost City is a place where wishes
are made real Is this not why men
have searched for centuries To
conjure one’s innermost desires
What a glorious thing that would be

He passes it to Marion as

PETER
What would you wish for Marion
What are your innermost desires

She and Indy make accidental eye contact The talk of
innermost desires flusters her but she covers quickly

MARION
To find the Lost City and name it
after myself “Marion-ville”

She hands it off to Lars whose eyes start rolling up as
LARS
I canfeel its thoughts It wants
to lead us to the Lost City that
awaits in the Valley of Dreams

The mood is broken by Indy who’s also rolling his eyes

INDY
Look maybe you can read it’s mind
Maybe it does grant wishes I’ve seen
some strange things in my time
wouldn’t surprise me But I never
found a lost city without being
practical Mr Hama you’re the map
expert

Hama nods pulling a sheaf of maps Indy rises to a camp table
lays out a map of Peru The others gather as Hama shows Indy

I was told this by the survivor of
the Oxley expedition I saw him
last year in Lima Poor fellow his
ordeal has left him quite insane

INDY
So were basing our plan on what
some guy in a nuthouse told you

MARION
Makes as much sense as those pictures
you took today that we almost died for

viktor lays down a stack of 8x10s Indy spreads them with his
hand displaying his aerial photos of the Nazca lines

INDY
Hey I’m just telling you Oxley’s
theory He was convinced these
pictograms are some kind of road
map Use ‘em in the right sequence
and connect the dots they supposedly
lead you straight to the Lost City

(looks to Peter)

The trick is figuring out which
order the pieces fit Thats the
part I don’t know

proper order He is the most psychic

Lars carefully gathers up the photos and map clasping them

joining tem Hama’s got the “Star” pictograph carefully drawn
on a clear sheet of plastic which he lays over the map It’s a
five-pointed star with one point longer than the others

HAMA
The Star comes first then the
Hummingbird If I could determine the
direction the Star points us it would
indicate our path

INDY
Star first then Hummingbird What
do you base that order on

HAMA
Belasko-San told me He specified the
sequence and said he would provide
further information as we drew closer

INDY
Star I don’t see how that applies
to where we are I

his voices trails off as he notices something He rises gazing
at the landscape increasingly amazed as the puzzle becomes
clear to him He points them out -- there are five mountain
peaks spread widely across the landscape before us

INDY
Five peaks Five points of a star

He crouches back down puts his fingers on the plastic and

revolves it into place On the map below it we see the five
oints the Star align the mountain peaks

but which of the peaks are the
direction we must go

One point of the Star’s longer than
the others Like an arrow Thats

Men are hacking away with machetes with Indy in the lead
INDY
Not looking too good up here This

stuff goes on forever

Marion appears offering a canteen He accepts it gratefully
takes his hat off to wipe his brow

INDY
Thanks Were gonna have to backtrack
and find a way around this if we
want to get the trucks through

As before Marion freezes in dread seeing something on the
ground behind Indy She points stuttering

MARION
S-s-s

INDY
What another snake Yeah lady
Jungles full of ‘em

MARION
Sn-sn-sn-

Marion’s trying to speak but it’s stuck in her throat Indy
just grins takes another swing blissfully unaware

INDY
Cmon what’s with you You’d think
you’d never seen a snake before

up behind him It rears up and up taller than on is —risit
staring down at him with a head bigger than a horses

MARION
Sna-sna-sna

Indy turns Looks up Expression going slack as

MARION
SNAAAAAAAKE

And GLUMP The s onInd i im to
the waist The beast rears up trying to get Indy down its
gullet Indy’s legs kicking and flailing in the air The
serpent slams back to earth maw widening and contracting
and within seconds even Indy’s kicking feet are gone All
that’s left is his hat which rolls across the ground

As a final insult the snake snatches up the hat and swallows
that too then turns and slithers off into the underbrush
Men are running from all directions converging as

MARION
SNAAAKE SNAAAKE SNAAAKE IT
SWALLOWED INDY

And the chase is on everybody yelling and hollering trying
to keep up The snake’s moving like greased lightning

Marion snatches a rifle from a bearer FIRES The shot misses
exploding the vines as the snake darts off Others OPEN FIRE

MARION
AIM FOR THE HEAD

They keep going following the heaving foliage to

A HUGE RUBBER TREE

rising high in the air The snake slithers up the trunk and
settles in the high branches hissing at the men below They’re
aiming their rifles trying for a clear shot when suddenly

The tip of a machete erupts through its skin The monster
starts thrashing and convulsing as it gets sliced open from
within Indy emerges covered in goo expecting firm ground --

-- only to find thin air He tumbles grabs a branch finds
himself dangling eye to eye with the snake It hisses dying

INDY
Something you ate

Indy reaches back inside the snake pulls his hat out of the
slime jams it back on his head

-and drops from the branches landing on his ass as everybody
crowds around He’s shaking teeth chattering cover with
slime He looks up at the dead snake

INDY
Now there’s something you don’t see
every day

Suddenly an eerie WHIRRING SOUND is heard Everybody pauses
listening A DRAGONFLY comes flitting into view It wouldn’t
be worth mentioning except that it’s about a yard long

MARION
Or that

It skims away over their astonished head as we

HIMMELMAN
These creatures simply don’t grow

PETER
Mutations of some kind

HIMMELMAN
But how What could cause such a
thing out here in the wild Certainly

Why else would the creatures grow

occasional big snake

INDY
(directed at Peter)
Just wondering where were getting
our information thats all

PETER
The skull has many tales to tell
One must learn how to listen
(off Indy’s look)
Cheer up Indiana Los Dioses does
exist In the Valley of Dreams The
Place where wishes come true

Indy wants to press the point but Marion suddenly glances
up Indy turns to see a shooting star streak across the sky

MARION
shooting star Make a wish

Suddenly the sky is streaked with them -- a meteor shower

PORFI
The sky is filled with wishes

INDY
It’s debris falling through the
atmosphere

MARION
Oh use your imagination Theyre
shooting stars Quick

Marion closes her eyes and makes a wish She opens them again
and catches Indy staring at her

MARION
No wishes

(wry)
What about your fortune and glory

Indy hesitates caught in her gaze -- for a moment we have a
good idea what his wish would have been Then he grimaces

INDY
Been chasing wishes all my life But
like my old man always saidif wishes
were horses beggars would ride
MARION

Hopeless
She goes over to join Peter who smiles

PETER
I got my wish

Good answer

She kisses him Indy rises heads over to

INT INDY’S TENT - NIGHT

Indy’s in his cot having fevered dreams As he did the first
time he saw the skull he’s hearing TERRIFYING WHISPERS
GUTTURAL INHUMAN VOICES speaking in strange tongues --

and he wakes to darkness He sits up trying to shake off
the dream He splashes his face from a canteen

-and hears a STRANGE TERRIFYING MOAN out there in the night
amidst all the jungle sounds He cocks his head listening

EXT INDYS TENT - NIGHT

- and emerges blanket over his shoulders Nothing now but
the sounds of insects and night birds But then

there it is again A LOW INHUMAN SOUND of primal fear and
despair That sound from that mysterious truck

Indy moves through camp furtive in the shadows A FLASH OF
LIGHTNING bathes the sky an eerie blue followed by a RUMBLE
OF THUNDER There’s a storm approaching

He peeks around a tent sees movement over by the trucks He
eases closer trying to see

Viktor’s at the rear of that tarp-covered truck waiting with
a tin plate of food in his hands But someone else is there
too hidden from view The tarp is open at the rear but the
truck is angled away from us and we can’t see what’s inside

The MOANS DIE DOWN The unseen person backs away from the

truck -- it’s Peter holding the Crystal Skull A FLASH OF
LIGHTNING makes it glow with blue fire in his hands Peter
nods to Viktor then walks off toward his tent

Alone now Viktor slides the food into the cage through a
slot drops the tarp back then turns and also departs

Indy detaches from the shadows
AT THE TRUCK

and pauses listening The thing in the cage is now eating
The sound of it makes Indy’s skin crawl He eases closer

»-eand the eating stops The creature has sensed hi presence

Indy reaches out and pulls the flap of the tarp slowly aside
trying to see what lurks there in the dark

At first we think it’s some kind of beast shifting around
all we see is a dark hunkered form and a tangle of hair And
then LIGHTNING EXPLODES directly above revealing

A human being A wild man Scrawny and lice-ridden Eyes
insane Hair and beard incredibly long and tangled He’s been
crouching in there eating his food with his fingers He
draws back MOANING like an animal startled at the sight of
Indy

Indy stares in horror Stunned beyond words

The storm breaks RAIN starts thundering down Indy shires
back as the man in the cage shifts forward sniffing as if
trying to identify him by smell grunting like a beast

Suddenly a skinny white arm shoots out and grabs Indy by the
wrist -- and the moment physical contact is made the wman’s
S a 1

shockingly with a scary ineidity The insane face presses to

the bars teeth glittering spewing a guttural voice

INDY

The wild man just grins gives Indy a canny look then

WILD MAN

Startled Indy jerks his hand away -- and the wild man’s
lucidity is instantly gone PUSH IN on Indy as the final
horror now creeps into his bones a ghastly dawning of
realization as the wild man’s face finally rings a bell

INDY

Professor Oxley

-but the man just draws back into the shadows moaning like
a beast leaving Indy standing in the thundering rain as we

FADE TO

EXT CAMP -— MORNING

(Daylight shows our geography we’re on a cliffy ridge hemmed
on three sides by wild descending terrain On the fourth side
the camp faces out over a sheer cliff that drops into a swift
RIVER below which flows down the canyon to a distant valley)

CAMERA FOLLOWS a Nazca photo being carried by hand -- the
pictograph humanoid in form of “The God” It’s Peter bringing
it to Hama at a camp table Everybody gathers closer as

PETER
Mr Hama I present the final piece
of the puzzle

HAMA
the final piece Are you sure

Peter nods The moment is electric everybody breathless with
awe and excitementexcept for Indy He’s been standing there
all the time just smoldering The man’s deeply pissed

INDY
Ask him how he knows
(off their looks)
Go on ask him

PETER
(turns)
Does it matter

INDY
It does to me you son of a--

WHAM Indy stuns everybody by throwing a powerhouse PUNCH
that sends Peter flying across the camp table collapsing it
in a rain of flying maps and splintering wood Hama jumps up
in shock Peter hits the ground as people scatter -

MARION
INDY

HAMA
Indiana-san This is intolerable
You’ve gone mad

INDY
Yeah mad’s the word all right

He jumps over the ruined table and lands another PUNCH just
as Peter’s rising to his knees The blow spins Peter around
sprawling him again in the dust Indy stands over him with
fists weaving ready to deck him again

INDY
What‘’d you do Belasko read the
skull’s mind Huh Ask it twenty
questions Or did you have help

Viktor darts in to protect his boss but Peter waves him off
PETER

No Viktor no need for that Just
a misunderstanding is all

Viktor backs off Peter rises painfully to his feet

PETER
It’s nothing tow civilized men
cant’ work out between them

-and WHAM Peter PUNCHE in the £
his ass Indy shakes his head to unrattle his brainsthen
looks up really steamed He scrambles to his feet and

Indy and Peter proceed to methodically pound the living
daylights out of each other swapping forceful controlled
punches circling and swinging each man giving as good as he
gets driving each other back by turns neither showing mercy
nor expecting any People scatter as the brawl takes the
combatants right through a tent ripping it out of the ground
Stakes and all They wrestle out from under the collapsed
canvas lunging to their feet squaring off again

»ewhen BLAM A RIFLE SHOT blows a huge gout of dust from the
ground at their tees They pause turning to see

MARION
ENOUGH

She’s got a lever-action Winchester and she’s pissed Indy
and Peter glance at each other wondering if they should push
their luck She pumps another round in the chamber

MARION
You both lost your minds What the
hell’s going on here

INDY
Ask the guy in the cage

From the look on her face she has no clue what he’s taking
about Indy crosses to her intense

INDY
Marion tell me you didn’t know
Look me in the eye and tell me

MARION
Know what

Indy pushes past her to the truck pulls a knife starts
slitting the tie-downs

INDY
That psychic you hired The Swede
You shouldn’t have bothered Your
husband had one stashed all along

and hauls the canvas tarp off the cage The wild man cringes
within blinded by daylight terrified People gather shocked
almost speechless at the sight of him

BY
My God What is this

INDY
Professor Vernon Oxley The sole
survivor of that expedition three
years ago
(moving toward Peter)
isn’t that right

Peter meets Marion’s gaze She’s stunned staring at him as
if he were a stranger hoping hell contradict this somehow

MARION
Peter

PETER
Would you have gone along with me
if I’d told you the truth

MARION
No

PETER
Of course not I know how sentimental
you Americans are
(to Indy)
He’s better off than I found him

INDY
Better than the asylum

PETER

There was no asylum Are you so
naive This country is hardly
progressive with the mentally ill

(drawing closer)
I found him in a traveling circus
“The wild Man of Los Dioses”
Peasants would pay their pesos to
jeer at him in a pit of squalor and
filth Should I have left him there
Would that please you more

INDY
He deserves the best care there is

PETER

And he shall get it As soon as the
task is complete

(steps close)
Know this Whatever happened to him
in the Lost city has reconfigured
his brain He is a psychic miracle
He and the skull are the divining
rod leading us to the greatest
archeological find of all time

INDY
Not if I can help it

Indy draws his arm back to punch him again but freezes as

ESCALANTE (0S)
Thats not your decision to make

HREE DOZEN SOLDIERS su appear fror he treeline
advancing with M-1 carbine rifles aimed In their midst is

ESCALANTE

good as to discard the rifle

Marion hesitates eases the hammer down tosses the rifle

ESCALANTE
That goes for everybody

Cured by her look everybody else starts disarming gunbelts
and rifles dropping into the dust

MARION
What’s the meaning of this

ESCALANTE
Must I remind you that all
antiquities in Peru belong to me
And that the penalty for
withholding is quite severe

(off her look)

It has come to my attention that
you have a certain Crystal Skull
Bring it to me now

Marion tosses a reluctant look to Indy and Peter but what
choice to they have She turns heading for a tent as

Yuri and von Grauen also emerge from the jungle trailed by
the Hovitos and Osgood Turner Peter bristles at the sight of
Von Grauen while Indy would love to break Yuri’s neck

PETER
Von Grauen You traitorous pig

VON GRAUEN
You should have met my price You’ve
only yourself to blame

INDY

Escalante)

Making new friends Yuri

YURI

that obnoxious habit you have of
staying alive

Marion reappears Escalante motions her forward She brings
him the knapsack He reaches in pulls out the Crystal Skull
holds it up for all to see Sunlight blazes through it
dazzling the eyes and the senses The reactions are immediate
and intense -- soldiers draw back muttering nervously The
Hovitos drop to their knees

ESCALANTE
It is exquisite It is mine

YURI (0S)
Not so fast

Yuriyanks the revolver out of Von Grauen‘’s holster knocking
the German on his ass in the bargain In the same swift motion
Yuri circles out into the clearing facing Escalante with the
gun leveled at his head Escalante smiles derisively

ESCALANTE
Never trust a communist

YURI
I hate to ruin the moment but I am
in control of this expedition

ESCALANTE

mere six bullets

Yuri thumbs the hammer back The solders tense forward rifles
aimed ready to fire

summoned by Yuri rush from the trees machine guns leveled

YURI
I’1l see your seven and raise you
Eight Zhukov commandos

Escalantes remaining soldiers are panicky but stand their
ground rifles aimed It’s a stand-off tension thick

Yuri turns to a commando who tosses him a machine gun Yuri
looks to Marion motions her toward Escalante

YURI
Now I really must insist Hand the
skull to the lady and she will
bring it to me

Marion starts across the clearing looking to both Indy and
Peter All are holding their breath as she moves to Escalante
He’s seething furious weighing the odds

ESCALANTE

--I don’t wish to create an

The men are amped-up fingers tightening on triggers ready
to open fire Escalante opens his mouth to shout the order

---but pauses Listening A STRANGE SOUND has been building
during the stand-offsome weird BUZZING growing louder

A hush falls Everybody listening now Birds are taking to
the air flapping out of the trees in panic Softly

PETER
What is that

Indy glances toward the trees Some unseen thing emerges from
the treeline coming through the grass leaving a long furrow

---and it pokes from the grass into the clearing A RED ARMY
ANT A big one Nine inches long Feelers twitching the air

MARION
(stunned)
A big ant

---and now dozens more furrows cut through the grass The
BUZZING SWELLS LOUDER The very trees start to shake

INDY
A lot of big ants

eee idal wave of ts burst ough the treeline like
an express train defoliating everything in their path

Pandemonium erupts as the ants overrun the camp -- everybody
running and screaming in all directions horses bolting mules
kicking and braying men trying to fight back with anything
at hand grabbing up shovels others FIRING rifles and machine
guns in sheer panic

Indy and Marion grab up shovels and join the fight smashing
ants right and left increasingly horrified They see a mule
get swarmed by ants kicking hysterically as it’s brought to
groundand stripped to the bone in seconds

Himmelman trips and falls overrun by a wave of antsand
his skeleton is revealed moments later as the insects move
on More men are swarmed including Von Grauen’s Hovitos
Skeletons start littering the ground Indy and Marion keep
fighting falling back toward the river

strapped to his back aiming a nozzle right at him

Indy darts out of the way as Viktor pulls the trigger and a
stunning GOUT OF FIRE ERUPTS from the nozzle He moves forward
hosing the ants with flame roasting them driving them back

but they’re also swarming around him in waves encircling
him from behind closing like a noose

INDY

--but it’s too late they’re streaming up Viktors body
chewing clothing and flesh He SCREAMS spraying the fire in
huge wild arcs setting tents aflame Indy throws himself on
Marion knocks her to the ground saving them both from getting
roasted as flame sweeps over the heads

-and Viktor goes down covered in an undulating wave and
the hose must’ve gotten chewed through because

A FIREBALL ERUPTS as Viktor EXPLODES

Still shielding Marion on the ground Indy looks through the
smoke and flames and sees

vicious punch He grabs the Skull stuffs it in the knapsack
and escapes toward Oxley’s truck

hurtle down the wild open terrain of the hill Indy barely in

Careening trucks Soviet commandos on horseback Escalante’s
APC Anything and everything

The pursuers surge down the slope exchanging GUNFIRE
everybody trying to beat everybody else to the prize A truck
flips and rolls causing other vehicles to collide and
swerve jamming up and falling behind

Four Soviet commandos leap their horses over the wreckage
surging ahead of the pack at a full gallop

and behind them that pesky fire is still racing along the
trail of fuel

INDY
I think we can outrun ‘em

They suddenly realize they’re heading for a rocky ledge Indy
can’t brake They go sailing off the edge and

branches The engine dies Marion gives Indy a withering look

MARION
Only you could park us in a tree

INDY
Only you could drive me out of mine

Indy starts cranking the key but the engine’s flooded

Behind them the four commandos ride up and leap from the
saddles with machine guns yelling for them to surrender

Not far behind that trail of fire travels ever closer

HAMA
I think they want us to surrender

MARION
Don’t worry We’1l blow up before
that happens

Suddenly the ENGINE ROARS TO LIFE

»and Indy floors it The truck lurches wheels spinning in
the branches the tree bending forward with the shifting
weight The commandos rush closer hollering for them to stop

Indy keeps flooring it truck lurching dipping closer to the
ground as the tree keeps bending more and more

Yuri gallops up fast yelling

SHOOT THEM JUST SHOOT

--and suddenly the truck breaks free and roars off causing
the tree to snap hugely back in the other direction and

The tree swats the four commandos to paste THWACK Yuris
stunned

The flames WHOOSH by still pursuing Indy’s truck along the
gasoline Yuri gallops after the truck racing the fire

INDY‘S TRUCK
careens onward brakeless barely in control Yuri gallops up

and does a horse-to-truck transfer grabbing the bars of Oxley’s
cage and hauling himself from the saddle

Yuri‘s now clinging to the side of the truck where Indy can
see him in the sideview mirror

YURI

Yuri reaches for the machine gun slung across his back Indy
yanks his revolver But before shots can be fired

MARION
(pointing)
Oh my gawd

The edge of a cliff is coming up Indy goes goggle-eyed So

does Yuri -- a cliff ahead and flames behind and no time to
think about either

The truck sails off into space Yuri is thrown clear vanishing
in freefall toward the river below as the flames finally catch
up WHOOSHING through the air on a trail of gasoline --

-- and the gas tank EXPLODES beneath the truck in mid-air
kicking the ass-end of the vehicle up on a BALL OF FLAME that
sends it cartwheeling end-over-end into --

THE RIVER

-- where it lands rightside up with a HUGE SPLASH the flames
extinguished But the current’s strong and before you know
it our heroes are getting swept downriver And they’re not
alone -- the river’s littered with men and horses that jumped
into the river to escape the ants also going for a ride

MOVING SHOT FROM RIVERBANK

The truck gets swept along Escalante’s APC ROARS into frame
fg swerving around trees (or mashing them flat) to keep
up Von Grauen and some soldiers are hanging on for dear life
Escalante’s in the turret hollering into his radio phone

ESCALANTE
(in Spanish subtitled)
INTO THE RIVER USE THE BOATS

RIVERBANK (FURTHER BACK)

Escalante’s men are scrambling to pull five collapsible boats
off the sides of the trucks and launch them as El Presidents
VOICE crackles from the radio

ESCALANTE (filtered)
(in Spanish subtitled)
IF THEY ESCAPE I’‘LL HAVE YOU ALL
SHOT EVERY LAST MAN

Soldiers pile into the wood and canvas longboats are swept
off by the current

RIVERBANK (FURTHER DOWN)

Yuri’s remaining four commandos see the longboats coming
Without hesitation the four men to four perfect dives into
the river at the exact same moment

A BOAT IN THE RIVER

---and the Russians pop up at the side of a boat grab the
soldiers toss them over and pull themselves aboard to
commandeer it One commando takes position with his machine
gun at the prow while the others work the oars

INDY’S TRUCKIN THE RIVER

Indy Marion and Hama are getting swept downriver in an
increasingly wild ride rapids appearing here and there water
pouring through the cab Indy valiantly struggles with the
wheel but there’s really no way to steer this thing They
carom off a boulder moving ever faster with the current

BACK OF TRUCK

C h a5 A
hold of Oxley’s cage yuri hauls himself from the water
climbing up the bars to the top of the cage over Oxley’s
astonished head The Russian makes his way forward using the
bars as handholds

IN THE TRUCK

Yuri suddenly kicks in the driver’s side window landing a
bootheel to Indy’s face Before Indy can react Yuri kicks
him in the face again knocking him senseless

Yuri pulls Indy out the window and drops him in the river
Indy vanishes in the current as Yuri slides in and replaces
him behind the wheel Marion and Hama are horrified

IN THE RIVER

Indy pops up gasping for air He looks around sees a HORSE
being swept toward him whinnying in panic Indy grabs the
reins calming the animal as he urges the horse toward shore
the best swimming and snorting frantically hooves finally
finding some traction on the riverbed

and Indy rides the horse out of the water onto solid ground
charging to a full gallop along the riverbank

ALONG THE RIVERBANK
Indy rides full-out veering around trees chasing the truck

as it sails downriver Across the river on the opposite bank
bg Escalante’s APC is also charging along smashing trees

ON THE APC

Von Grauen spots Indy across the river nudges Escalante to
get his attention points Escalante swings his 50 caliber
MACHINE GUN around and OPENS FIRE

INDY

gallops like crazy as the TRACER FIRE from across the river
rips the trees and branches to fragments above his head He
ducks loses himself in the trees charging ever onward

IN THE RIVER

-while the truck is getting swept along faster and faster
bucking now in the increasing WHITE RAPIDS

RIVERBANK (FURTHER AHEAD)

Indy comes galloping up to the edge of a drop The river is a
raging white torrent below He looks upriver and sees the
truck come into view getting swept around the bend Indy’s
gotten ahead of it

Frantic he tries to gauge the distance to the middle of the
river It seems as impossible jump but

There are several huge trees lining the drop with long jungle
vines trailing off the edge

Indy spurs the horse grabs a vine swings clean out of the
saddle and wildly out over the river a pendulum of enormous
distance that lands him in the middle of the rapids He
plummets and vanishes in the froth as

THE TRUCK

rides the rapids white water spuming over the hood and past
the windows Suddenly from ahead

id i li rt he hood and
HI ight i ie Yuri gets Indiana Jones
and about fifty gallons of water right in the face

Indy nails him with a brutal flurry of punches -- WHAM WHAM
WHAM -- and shoves him out the side window Yuri vanishes in
the rapids Indy gabs the wheel yells to Marion over the
water thundering through the cab

INDY
ANYTHING HAPPEN WHILE I WAS GONE

Suddenly GUNSHOTS Abullet blows the sideview mirror to
fragments They look back

The longboats of soldiers are on their tail rifles BLAZING
riding the rapids -- which are getting even worse

PURSUING BOAT 1

smacks headlong into a boulder and comes apart in an instant
hurling shattered wood and screaming men in all directions to
vanish in the churning water

PURSUING BOAT 2

CAPTAIN
(in Spanish subtitled)
SHOOT THOSE BASTARDS

The soldiers let loose a BLISTERING BARRAGE One particularly
brave (stupid) soldier rises up with rifle poised trying for
a clear shot -- an nc ut

of the boat with a sickening THUD
PURSUING BOAT 3

Yuri’s commandos They’re catching up to Indy’s truck The
commando on the prow makes a spectacular leap grabs onto
Oxley’s cage unslings his machine gun

-and Oxley bites his knuckles The commando plummets into
the churning water Pissed the other Russians OPEN FIRE

IN THE TRUCK

Marion ducks as BULLETS SLAM into a dashboard before her
and rip it to pieces

MARION
LETS SEEHOW COULD WE MAKE THIS
SITUATION WORSE

Indy tosses her a “you had to ask” look Suddenly the truck
seems to drop out of frame as

THE RIVER

a the rapids
becoming the nastiest most awesome white water imaginable

The truck and the boats come slamming up into view through
raging walls of water and crashing back down again taking
the hairiest ride ever seen In fact it’s not a ride so much
as a controlled fall down the mountain via rapids

Indy and his pursuers go slamming through an awesome series
of dips seeming to vanish completely in the torrential rapids
before bobbing back into view Massive ROCKS loom at every
turn threatening to smash them to pieces The truck and boats
are swept along like corks in a flood whipping through wild
spinning turns with every change of direction

INDY’S TRUCK

Indy Marion and Hama are just gasping and holding on for
dear life water surging through the cab

MARION
WERE GONNA DIE IN THESE RAPIDS

INDY
IT’S NOT THE RAPIDS I’M WORRIED
ABOUT IT’S THE FALLS

MARION
THE WHAT

Marions eyes bug out
A WATERFALL

as they go airborne An endless gut-churning moment of
freefall the pursuing boats hurtling into mid-air right behind
tem Everybodys SCREAMING as they drop back into the rapids
and get swept along toward -

A SECOND WATERFALL

-- and going airborne again More screaming freefall Men
spilling into the water as boats overturn and fly apart swept
along toward --

YET A THIRD WATERFALL

-- and the truck hurtles awesomely into the air again Behind
them more men and boats go flying

The boat with Yuri’s commandos takes a nasty bounce and shoots
off the falls at a bad angle The commandos are screaming

(and holding on) as they sail through the air on a long lethal
are that ends with them going SPLAT on the rocks below in an
explosion of wood fragments and cartwheeling bodies

INDY’S TRUCK

the river levels out Marion and Hama are overjoyed

MARION
WE MADE IT WERE ALIVE

But Indy has remained silent and intense staring straight
INDY
(softly)
One more to go

All eyes turn forward Shit

THE FOURTH (AND BY FAR THE BIGGEST) WATERFALL

cascades from the cliffs The truck rockets over the edge as
if shot from a cannon free-falling endlessly toward the water
belowand impacting with an AWESOME SPLASH

Happily the river widens considerably here so no more rapids
Unhappily the river’s also a lot deeper and the truck sinks
nose-first as the current carries it along

Indy Marion and Hama pop to the surface gasping Indy’s
got the knapsack with the Skull slings it around his neck

INDY
SWIM FOR SHORE

The rear of the truck is bobbing in the water barely breaking
the surface Oxley’s trapped arms flailing through the bars

Indy grabs onto the cage swept along struggling to open the
latch before Oxley drowns It’s padlocked Indy draws his
revolver BLOWS the lock off wrenches the door open He pulls
Oxley out swimming desperately toward

THE RIVERBANK

Indy pulls Oxley to safety crawls a few feet up the muddy
bank and collapses facedown He tries to catch his breath --

INDY
Professor You ok--

-- an lances up just in time ’
out of frame Stunned Indy shoves himself off the ground
trying to see where Oxley went

INDY
Professor

Indy takes off in pursuit
VARIOUS ANGLES

«--and the chase takes them through denser and denser jungle
Oxley always two steps ahead -- in fact Indy never really
sees him clearly just catches bare glimpses of him vanishing
around trees or as a fast-moving blur through the leaves

INDY
Professor Wait

Indy’s getting lost disoriented in all this green He pauses
to listen hoping to pinpoint his Oxley by sound

and the wild man swings overhead on a vine appearing and
vanishing like a sight gag Indy gapes up climbs the nearest
tree to go after him

IN THE TREES

-and the chase continues through the trees Oxley in
glimpses fast he an ape swinging from vine to vine catching
branches and hurtling on like a gymnast off the bars

-with Indy not far behind swinging on vines but lacking
Oxley’s animal agility Indy lands on a branch desperately
trying to keep his balance and realizes he’s run out of vines
He pulls his whip and cracks it forward using his whip now

to keep swinging from tree to tree until

CRACK A branch breaks with his weight and Indy plummets to
the ground landing flat on his back He sits up groaning

No sign of Oxley No sound now but the jungle birds

INDY
PROFESSOR

From a distance

MARION (0S)
Indy

Indy’s swept with relief realizing he would have been
devastated if something had happened to her He scrambles to
his feet blunders through the growth toward a clearing

INDY
Marion Thank God I thought I lost
you

NEW ANGLE

-and he freezes as he emerges into the clearing Not twenty
yards away

Yuri He’s got Marion by the wrist and the machine gun pressed
to her side while Hama stands helplessly by

YURI
You have no idea how much trouble
youve caused me Discard the gun

Indy pulls his pistol tosses it

INDY
Let her go Yuri

YURI
Of course Just hand over the skull

Indy nods pulls the knapsack from around his neck Yuri prods
Marion forward to retrieve it She starts across the clearing
but pauses halfway as suddenly

Escalante’s APC CRASHES through the trees into the clearing
and lurches to a stop Stampeding into view are a DOZEN
remaining soldiers soaked to the bone and aiming rifles

They’ve got a GROUP OF PRISONERS - Peter Osgood Turner
Porfi two of Porfi’s men Marion’s delighted to see her
husband (a reaction Indy doesn’t share)

MARION
Peter

PETER
Marion Are you all right

She nods Escalante descends from his turret and jumps to the
ground followed by Von Grauen

YURI
el Presidente How inconvenient

ESCALANTE
there’s nowhere you can run that I
cannot follow And as you can see
you are quite outnumbered Surrender
your machine gun

INDY
Were running out of guys Yuri Do
as he says

YURI
(hesitates)
Very well
ESCALANTE

Sefiora Belasko Bring me the weapon

PETER
No Please I insist she move out
of harm’s way Ill do it

Marion’s very impressed with Peter Indy grimaces -- shit
why didn’t I think of that

Peter walks out bravely to take her place Marion moves aside
gazing after him adoringly Peter steps up to Yuri the two
men now standing face to face

INDY
Take it Peter Take the gun

Peter reaches up Takes the machine gun from Yuri Both men
glaring into each other’s eyes Beat

Peter abruptly turns MACHINE GUN BLAZING in his hands raking
it back and forth mowing down all of Escalantes men Only
Escalante and von Grauen are left standing

In the shocked silence that follows

PETER
I thought you’d never get here

YURI
It wasn’t for lack of trying

Marion stares at Peter in utter disbelief rocked to her
heels trying to process what just happened

MARION
Peter

INDY
(kicking himself)
He’s a spy For the Russians I
should’a known
(to Yuri)
You were in it with him all along

PETER
Yes it was quite awkward when you
showed up instead

MARION
A spy For the Russians
PETER

Well-yes

(off her look)
Sorry darling I didn’t know how
to tell you

MARION
Boy you think you know a guy

Beat She hauls off and PUNCHES him in the nose whipping his
head to one side He looks back at her exasperated

PETER
Sweetness Arent we over-reacting

MARION
this isn’t like leaving the cap off
the toothpaste Peter Your a
goddamn Russian spy

PETER
Indeed butyou’re not going to
let a little thing like that come
between us are you
(off her look)
Marion please don’t ask me to make
a choice
1li

MARION
I‘m an American Peter Through and
through You knew that when you
married me What do you expect me
to do convert

Indy and Yuri have been trading embarrassed glances during
all this Indy clears his throat

INDY
uh lookyou guys have the guns
right So you win Why don’t the
rest of us just walk away

Peter spins to Indy machine gun poisedand pauses gazing
up in wonder as he realizes there they are Softly

PETER
Are you stupid as well as blind

Indy follows his gaze
--and we reveal an awesome sight above the trees The canyons

end at this spot Clouds are just clearing the sun splashing
light across the cliffs on both sides of the river -- into

ax EFAC
valley They’ re like sentinels or gate posts The visages
are humanoidthrough not really human

PETER
Behold The Great Stone Sentinels
of Los Dioses The twin gods that
mark the entrance to the Valley of
Drams We are here

Peter prods Indy up the rise Yuri herding the others along
behind them

and CAMERA BOOMS UP to reveal the Valley of Dreams spread
before us ringed by mountainous volcanic ridges the floor
of the valley overgrown with lush green rainforest Peeking
through the jungle are amazing ancient ruins at the very
center of which stands the grandest building of all -- the
Great Stone Temple of the Gods Also amazing is the fact that
the rushing river cascades from the canyon into a man-made
aqueduct that crosses the valley right to the Great Stone
Temples doorstep (more on that later) Indy and the others
take it all in stunned

INDY
It is the greatest find of all
time

YURI
Yes But belongs to the Kremlin
now Sorry Indy Your knowledge of
this place must die with you

Peter glances to Marion then looks back down at Escalante’s
APC FIVE 50-GALLON FUEL DRUMS are mounted on the rear

PETER
Porfi Bring your men

WIPE TO
INT CAVE - DAY

We are inside one of the Great Stone Faces on the cliff The
cave entrance is the mouth with the eyes above letting in
streams of daylight like windows TILT DOWN TO

The fuel drums stand together in the middle of the cave Sitting
on the ground with their backs to the drums and tied in a circle
around them (with Escalante’s own rope) are Indy Marion Hama
Escalante von Graven and Osgood Turner Porfi and his men
stand by watching as

Peter and Yuri tighten the knots Marion glares at Peter as
he kneels to check her rope -- if looks could kill

PETER
I want you to come with me

MARION
I want a divorce

Next to her Indy reacts with a big sheepish grin -- that’s
the best news everbut on the other hand they’re all about
to die Peter raises a bundle of TNT before Marion

PETER
Then you shall have one

--and leans over her packing it into the drums Meanwhile
Yuri comes around to Indy’s side uncoiling a long fuse

INDY
I thought you loved America

YURI
But Mother Russia is my soul Our
little cold wars will heat up some
day soon There will be a final
reckoning -- an apocalyptic struggle
to inherit the earth For the sake
of mankind our side must win

TURNER
Right the great communist utopia
Heard it all before You try
anything our side‘1l bury you

INDY
Hes right

Peter steps in crouching down intense

PETER
I think not The Crystal Skull has
spoken In the Lost City there lurks
a psychic force beyond our wildest
drams Perhaps greater than the
atomic bomb We shall learn to control
it Use it against you

INDY
If wishes were horses

YURI
No Indy if wishes were weapons
Imagine To peer across the world
and know your enemy’s secrets Freeze
their missiles in their silos
Assassinate their leaders All with
the power of our minds

PETER

A new frontier of psychic warfare
That was Stalin’s dream Your
precious country shall pass into
history as extinct as ancient Rome

tenderly brushes

Marion’s cheek)
What is our little marriage compared
to that

He rises joins Yuri They move toward the mouth of the cave
playing out yards of fuse

PETER
Now if you’ll excuse us The next
great adventure lies ahead The
world that Marx dreamed of

-but they freeze at the sound of RIFLES BEING COCKED They
turn Porfi and his two men have M-1 rifles aimed at them

PORFI
I myself am not political Sefior

WIPE TO

Peter and Yuri are now also tied to the drums (Marion’s between
Indy and Peter) ANGLE TO Porfi tightening their knots

PORFI
«me I’m a capitalist I believe
in money

Porfi rises Escalante is ecstatic
114

ESCALANTE
Excellent work compafieros You
shall be rewarded Untie me

Porfi’s pals (PABLO and FRANCISCO) toss uncomfortable glances
his way wondering if they should But Porfi shakes his head
reassuring them

PORFI
Nah See me and the boys talked it
over And we think all the antiquities
in Peru should belong to us I don’t
know about his psychic stuff but
the legend says the city is made of
gold Vaya con dios everybody

The grab the Crystal Skull light the fuse and hustle out of
the cave Gone The fuse HISSES AND SPUTTERS merrily along

INDY
Yuri How long’s that fuse

YURI
About three minutes give or take

INDY
Can you reach it with your foot
Snuff it out

YURI
Its poly-tensile cord with titanium
and magnesium fibers You can’t
snuff it out or cut it with an ax
It even burns underwater

MARION
Great

PETER
May I suggest that--

MARION
(snaps at him)
shut up I can’t believe you were
gonna kill me I don’t wanna hear a
word out of you

INDY
Loose ropes Anybody

Everybody twists and strains but the knots are tight
HAMA

I suggest we rock the drums Perhaps
we can tip them over

INDY
Right My way first On threeone
two three

the whole group rocks toward Indy giving it all they’ve got
straining like crazy The drums aren’t budging an inch

MARION
Well this is stupid

They give up sagging Indy shifts his leg trying to get his
boot up to where his hands are tied to his chest

INDY
I’ve got a knife in my boot If I
could just reach it

«but it’s no good His fingers hover a good twelve inches
shy of success He gives up in frustration

INDY

I’m not as limber as I used to be
MARION

So that’s it
INDY

‘Fraid so
Pause She turns to look at him Their eyes meet

MARION
Sorry I got you into this

INDY
I thought I got you into this

Beat Indy’s working up the courage to say something He drops
his voice to a whisper so the others can‘t hear

INDY
UhMarion Listen I just wanted
to tell you thatwellI just
wanted to sayI still uh

On the other side of Marion we see Peter turn his head

PETER
What

INDY
(exasperated)
I LOVE HER LOUD ENOUGH FOR YOU

PETER
I can’t believe you two are
discussing this in my presence

INDY
Hey The marriage is over Live
with it

He turns his attention back to Marion She’s dewey-eyed

MARION
Youre just saying that ‘cause
were about to die

INDY
Wellit does help ease the fear
of commitment But I mean it

They lean toward each other straining against their ropes
Their lips touch A lovely kiss As Indy draws back

INDY
To kiss her means death I guess he
was right

MARION
Who

-and his gaze shifts looking past her

INDY
Oxley
Marion turns ere’ wild man a of the cave
INDY

Professor Help us Can you
understand what Im saying

Oxley scurries in He draws near touches Indy’s face Again
that strange lucidity overcomes him that ragged whisper

OXLEY
You’re the man in the water

INDY
Thats right Now please There’s a
knife in my boot We’re all about
to go boom Yuri

YURI
Oh sixty seconds Maybe less

OXLEY
(grins)
Death dearth death The gods will
be plucking many pretty skulls today
yes many pretty skulls

MARION
Indy this guy’s giving me the creeps

INDY
Don’t help okay Professor look
at the rope Can you cut the rope

OXLEY
looks down)
Thick Very thick

Oxley puzzles over the rope for a moment then surprises Indy
by abruptly grabbing it in both hands and gnawing it

PETER
What’s happening

INDY
He’s chewing on it

VON GRAUEN
Wonderful

MARION

Can you try explaining the knife
again We don’t have time for--

Oxley chews through it and whips his head up teeth bared
HOWLING in animal triumph Indy and Marion are stunned Fast
Indy wrestles out of his ropes jumps to his feet yanks his
knife from his boot He slices Marions rope first pulls her
to her feet Then Hama then the others then

Only Peter and Yuri are still tied up Indy hesitates throws
a look to Marion tempted to leave them He sighs He can’t
he’s the hero He grabs up an M-1 rifle left at the cave
entrance by Porfi tosses it to her She works the bolt as

INDY
Shes in charge of this expedition
Got that

YURI

(glances at the fuse)
In ten seconds there will be no
one in charge

Indy leans down slices their ropes

EXT CAVE - DAY

and they all burst from the mouth of the cave jumping for
it down the incline as WA-BOQQOOM A HUGE EXPLOSION blows
flame out of the mouth and eyes of the Stone Face A moment
later the face collapses in a smoking hole in the cliff

DISSOLVE TO

EXT GRAND PLAZA OF THE GREAT TEMPLE - DAY

and our group struggles into the Lost City passing vine-
shrouded colonnades and ancient broken archways entering

The grand plaza of The Great Stone Temple of the Gods The
Temple is pyramid-shaped in the Mayan style gigantic with
various levels working upwards toward a crown of altars and
odd battlements It’s backlit by the late sun throwing an
awesome shadow across the crumbled plaza Unlike Mayan
buildings though this one has a massive open entrance looming
like a dark open doorway some sixty or seventy feet high As
mentioned before the river from the canyons is funneled here
by the aqueduct -- raging white rapids thunder across the
plaza along the stone channel and disappear directly into the
heart of the Great Temple through that towering open doorway

Oxley grows more terrified as they approach cowering at the
sight of the building As they reach the building’s shadow
he hunkers down gibbering in raw animal panic

Indy crouches before him grabs his flailing wrist in a firm
grip -- and the instant physical contact is made Oxley calms
and that strange lucidity returns Indy looks him in the eye

INDY
Professor What happened to you
here What are you so afraid of

OXLEY
(tortured hushed)
I can’t remember

A mysterious WIND kicks up billowing dust across the plaza
and sending a chill of premonition through them all

MARION (0S)
Indy

He turns Marions staring up at the Temple He follows her
gaze and sees

A SILHOUETTED FIGURE

is revealed through the billowing dust He’s on the steps
leading up to the first level of the Temple Just standing
there Watching them Backlit by sun

The figure comes slowly down the steps a machete dangling in
one hand In the other he’s cradling a knapsack in his arm
and holding what appears to be a glowing head The machete
slips from his fingers CLANKING down the steps

He reaches the bottom and approaches us It’s Porfi Mind
blown One side of his face raw from a second degree burn
His clothes streaked with blood The glowing head he’s holding

is the Crystal Skull It drops from his shaking hand -- Indy
reacts fast catching it

INDY
Porfi Where are your friends

Porfi’s disoriented trying to speak

PORFI
Pablohehe touched the gold and
was consumed by the fire of the Gods
and then the Skull spoke to meit
said we had defiled this placeit
said we had to make a sacrifice to
appease the anger of los Dioses

He turns gaze traveling back up the steps from where he came
Drops of blood lead up to the first level of the templewhere
a headless body lies seeping blood down the steps

PORFI
So I cut off Francisco’s head

Porfi abruptly yanks a decapitated head from the knapsack
holding it by the hair The mouth is thrown open in a silent
scream eyes frozen wide and staring up at the heavens

Porfi’s expression now matching his dead friend’s -- eyes and
mouth wide as can be -- and he starts to SCREAM Over and over
again Horrible ear-splitting SHRIEKS He drops the head in
the dust at Indy’s feet and runs off SCREAMING as if he‘ll
never stop vanishing into the jungle

Indy looks to the others Everybodys in shock

INDY
We can turn back

He meets peter’s gaze In the look that passes between them
we can see there’s no way either of them are backing down

Indy turns TIGHT TO CAMERA gazing with intense purpose at
the huge entrance to the Temple

TURNER
Whoa whoa waitdon’t we get a vote

INDY
(not looking back)
It’s not a democracy

and he exits frame Marion glares at peter rifle aimed
MARION

That should make you feel right at
home

The group follows Indy Turner glances down at the
decapitated head hurries after them

INT THE GREAT STONE TEMPLE - DAY

and they enter through the massive open doorway leaving
daylight behind They move along the raging rapids of the
aqueductand as their eyes adjust HUGE SHAPES appear in
the darkness DOZENS OF GIANT WHEELS are being spun at great
speed by the rapids each wheel at least fifty feet tall
They’re in a single long row down the aqueduct one after the
other mounted on a line of support gantries

HAMA
Water heels

Indy moves closer The gantries appear metallic

INDY
They’returbines

YURI
Impossible

Descending from arrays of connectors on each gantry are series
of SOLID GOLD CONDUITS as thick as a man’s wrist running
across the floor in long weaving patterns (viewed from high
above the floor of this place would look like a giant computer
chip schematic) Indy follows the HUMMING conduits finds

A DEAD MAN on the floor body still smoking the ashes of the
hand gripping a conduit Indy crouches as the others gather

MARION
Pablo

INDY
Porfi said he touched the gold and
was consumed by the fire of the
Gods

Indy picks up a pebble and tosses it on the conduit The pebble
EXPLODES with a flash and puff of smoke

INDY
Yeah Pablo Electrocuted These
gold rails are conductors
(gazes around)
this whole place is like a massive
power generating plant

Everybody’s wrestling to accept something patently impossible

PETER
No no that can’t be This city’s
at least ten thousand years old
They wouldn‘t have such technology
They couldnt

TURNER
Generating power for what

INDY
(rises)
don’t step on the rails

They proceed down the huge Corridor of Wheels encountering
more and more BODIES along the way -- some are ash like Pablo
others merely skeletal cobwebby remains all long dead At
the point where the wheels end they turn a corner into

A LONG DARK CORRIDOR
Indy inches cautiously into the gloom

INDY
Were gonna need a torch

and an OVERHEAD FIXTURE STARTS TO GLOW The light is dim
and greenish Indy glances to the others astonished

As they proceed the overhead fixtures track them as if by
motion sensor -- the ones ahead start to glow as they approach
the ones behind them dimming back to darkness

The walls are lined with HIEROGLYPHS on both sides Images
depict human slaves constructing the city Priests and acolytes
praying to flaming fireballs in the sky Blood sacrifices
Strange tall inhuman forms The group emerges into

A HUGE ANTECHAMBER

--which really blows their minds It’s like a huge warehouse
crammed with stuff They move down the aisle increasingly
stunned If you took the contents of the dozen best museums

of antiquity in the world and dumped them here Well it’d

be a drop in the bucket There are artifacts from every ancient
era from all over the world heaped helter-skelter

ESCALANTE
Madre de Dios I am the wealthiest
man in the world

The others are looking around numb trying to absorb it all

PETER
Macedonian EgyptianCeltic

INDY
-SumerianEtruscanGreek

MARION
-RomanBabylonian

Indy stops seeing primitive stone tools He picks one up

INDY
«-prehistoric Stone Age

He’s blown away His gaze goes to an intact EGYPTIAN SKIFF
leafed with gold and hung with cobwebs oars still in place
Nearby are rows of gorgeously painted Egyptian SARCOPHAGI

INDY
I must be dreaming

PETER
It’s no dream it’s a motherload
Artifacts from every ancient era of
mankind There’s not a museum in
the world that wouldnt sell its
soul

INDY
try a dozen museumsa hundred

HAMA
How can this be How could they
gather this from all over the world
From so many different ages

He looks to Indy for answers

INDY
One things for sure They were
collectors Like us

Marion steps into frame cocks her head -- look there

Down at the end of the aisle is an ORNATE ARCHWAY leading to
another room The archway is a startling BAS-RELIEF OF SOLID
GOLD depicting celestial bodies Indy leads the way

THE CHAMBER OF THE GODS

eand they enter It’s dark just the light spilling through
the door The room is big though not as huge as the antechamber
they just left And it’s round Hama moves to the center of

the room where a round GOLD BAS-RELIEF occupies the floor

HAMA
(crouches)
A celestial map These starsit’s
the Pleiades system

«-and no sooner has he spoken than DIM GREENISH LIGHT BEGINS
TO GLOW from fixtures set into the curved walls But more
astonishing than the fixtures is what they reveal

THIRTEEN THRONES are spaced in a wide circle around us On
the thrones covered with cobwebs and the dust of ages sit
THIRTEEN CRYSTAL SKELETONS -- all missing their heads

All eyes go to Indy He looks down at the Skull in his hand
Looks back to the skeletons He moves forward wondering which
skeleton the Skull belongs to

-and he pauses expression going slack He raises the Skull
cocks his head as is listening Then his gaze shifts to a
specific skeleton and he veers toward it

MARION
How do you know which one

INDY
It told me

Marion and the others trade ominous looks Indy mounts the
steps to the base of the throne pauses He lifts the Crystal
Skull to the skeleton’s shouldersand finds that it slots
perfectly in place Click

Ephemeral ripples of light begin in the skull swirling down
in the body dancing and flowing as delicately as smoke
The skeleton now complete glows from within

Indy backs away gasping Everybody shies back Oxley loses
it completely throwing himself to the floor in a fetal ball
writhing and moaning in a meltdown of mindless terror

Placing the skull was like fitting a key in a lock because

A DEEP RUMBLE BEGINS The ie - i f£ the plete es

the middle of the f n isin the
lens of a camera Everybody scatters out of the way as the
floor just keeps opening wider and wider steam and brilliant
light rising from below

-along with something big A massive dark shape Rising up
higher and higher looming We get a sense of machinery humming
beneath the floor not primitive stone mechanisms but machines
Indy glances into the glowing pit gets a brief impression of
engineered technology -- lights descending into a blinding pit
of hydraulic rams gears superstructure

and WHUMP The shape comes to a stop its round base
perfectly fitting the hole in the floor shutting out the
light and sound from below

What’s risen into view is a thick circular column of exotic
machined design fitting from floor to ceiling Ringing the
column are thirteen seats facing outward suggesting futuristic
astronaut blast-seats otherworldly and remarkable -- but

ka

They re facing out their ‘lines of sight matching the ring of
Crystal Skeletons facing in A skeleton per alien

Indy and the others gather gazing up at the ALIEN opposite
the glowing skeleton It’s been dead so long it’s mummified
It’s humanoid but taller -- some ten feet in height gangly

and angular with an array of ridges and spines spreading

from its neck and skull like an exotic headdress Like the
Crystal Skeletons the mummy is covered with cobwebs Indy
notices dusty transparent tubes running out of the column and
the seats plugged into the creatures desiccated flesh

Indy reaches out feeling one of the creatures fingers It
snaps off softly in his hand falling to dust at his feet

MARION
What are they

INDY
I don’t know but they’ve been dead
a long time

HAMA
Look

They turn The shimmering light in the room is growing
brighter because

The Crystal Skeleton is gaining brilliance swirls of light
rippling and coursing through its form They shield their

eyes as the light gathers most intensely in the skull -- and
TWIN BEAMS OF LIGHT shoot over their heads from the skeleton’s
eyes in the alien mummy’s the two now connected by
supernatural force Indy notices with dread that the tubes
sunken into the alien’s flesh have begun seeping fluids

INDY
Ive got a bad feeling about this

--and a MASSIVE BOOMING VOICE SUDDENLY FILLS THE ROOM

VOICE
ANUNG UN RAMA AMUNG DOOL AMUNG
DOON ABAYA ANUNG UN RAMAAAA

MARION
Where‘s that coming from

Turner’s backing away pointing

TURNER
It’s the weird guy

Everybody turns
ANGLE ON THE GROUP

as Oxley rises up into frame facing camera arms held aloft
weird glowing vapor streaming from his nose and mouth hair
billowing against gravity as if underwater The man we knew

is gone -- what remains is a conduit of unearthly power As

we watch his eyes roll slowly up in his head until the pupils
vanish completely - only the whites are now visible

His mouth opens a living microphone for the Gods VOICE
CONTINUING TO ECHO AND BOOM

OXLEY ALIEN
TO THE SACRED PLACE WE WELCOME YOU

«eand he turns to face the group More and more glowing vapor
is forming streaming to Oxley from the alien mummy and the
Crystal Skeleton forming rivulets that swirl about his body
and create vague wispy shapes in the air above his head

INDY
Who are you

«and when Oxley speaks streams of vapor exhale form his
nose and mouth forming shapes that dissipate in the air before
their eyes like an opium addict’s dream

OXLEY ALIEN
WE ARE THE ONES WHO FELL FROM THE
HEAVENS WE ARE THE NEPHALIM WE
ARE THE RUBEZAHL WE ARE THE LIGHTS
IN THE SKY YOUR KIND HAS GIVEN US
MANY NAMES YOU MAY WORSHIP US

INDY
Uh thank you
(glances to the others)
»your Worshipfulness

Peter moves forward eyes gleaming

PETER
When did you come here

OXLEYALIEN
WHEN OUR KIND WAS VERY OLD AND
YOUR KIND WAS VERY YOUNG

and now the vapor flows in ever more distinct images in the
air above the OxleyAlien’s headdizzying star clusters being
traversed at inconceivable speedsarriving at the slowly
spinning ball of planet Earthdescending toward what would
later be the Yucatan Peninsula and South Americaracing over
parched arid landscapesand the vapor transforms into
PRIMITIVE APE MEN throwing themselves shrieking to the ground
in terror as awesome booming LIGHTS ripple across the sky

OXLEYALIEN
WE NURTURED YOU ENHANCED YOU SET
YOU ON THE PATH TO CIVILIZATION
GAVE YOU KNOWLEDGE OF THE STARS

«and the vapor forms the great stone Mayan Calendar

OXLEYALIEN
YOU CAME TO LOVE US FEAR US YOUR
WORSHIP PROVIDED US MUCH THAT WE
NEEDED TO SURVIVE

»and the Calendar swirls into a Mayan priest wearing a grand
headdress patterned after the ridges and pines of the aliens’
heads eyes wide in fervor as he plunges a ceremonial dagger
into the chest of a screaming human sacrifice From the chest
swirling up and is inhaled by an alien

OXLEYALIEN
AND WHEN OUR TIME WAS PASSING WHEN
OUR BODIES BEGAN TO DIEWE PLACED
OUR GODLY ESSENCE INTO THE THIRTEEN
SACRED VESSELS

eand the vapor transforms into the thirteen Crystal Skulls
floating in the air They descend settling upon the shoulders
of thirteen Crystal Skeletons

OXLEYALIEN
THAT WE MIGHT SOMEDAY BE REBORN
WHEN OTHERS OF OUR KIND CAME TO
CLAIM US

«and the image breaks apart flowing and reforming into
the head of the alien itself floating above Oxley like the
Great and Powerful Oz matching Oxley’s movements as

OXLEYALIEN
YOU HAVE BROKEN OUR SLUMBER DO YOU
BRING ALL THE SKULLS THAT WERE TAKEN
FROM THIS PLACE

INDY
Umwell not exactly

OXLEYALIEN
THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE

HAMA
We came seeking knowledge

The alien pauses pondering

OXLEY ALIEN
YES YOU ALWAYS WERE AN INQUISITIVE
SPECIES IT IS YOUR STRENGTH AND
YOUR WEARNESS

and glowing vapor streams from his image out to Indy and
the group swirling among them probing

OXLEY ALIEN
THERE ARE FIVE AMONG YOU FIVE
WITH THE GREATEST NEED THE GREATEST
THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE ALL THAT
THERE IS TO GAIN YOU ARE LIKE THE
PRIESTS WHO SPILLED THE RIVERS OF
BLOOD IN OUR NAME

»-and the vapor encircles the five Peerthen YuriVon
GrauenEscalantefinally Indy The vapor glows brighter

OXLEYALIEN
YOU ARE THE FIVE YOU ARE THE CHOSEN

-and the five men are lifted into the air and brought before
the alien They hover there enguifed in a forming cloud of
vapor and brilliance -- but more than mere light the cloud
growing around them is a place of dreams They stare into the
swirling promise of all the knowledge in the cosmos stunned
by it hypnotized blown away In that seething cauldron lies
all the power and glory in the universe

Hama and Turner watch agape Marion steps closer terrified

MARION
Indy

Indy Peter and the others hover there eyes wide breath
gone gazing into the furnace of the Gods A whisper

INDY
Marion Marion It’s

MARION
It’s what

INDY

MARION
Indy no Don’t touch it

But the five men are in the grip of fervor each in his own
“zone of the swirling cloud each man seeing different things
specific to them taking shape in the vapor the alien now
speaking in thirteen mingled voices

away from all the wonder before himand turns looking back
to Marion Their eyes meet His smile to her is beautiful
both sad and joyful because in his heart he knows and his

leok says it all -- he wants Marion
And suddenly WHUMP Indy is released from th el

drops to his side both of them looking up as

VON GRAUENS “ZONE”

VON GRAUEN
(screaming ecstatic)
I want the dream reborn I want the

«the vapor of Von Grauen’s wish takes final shape the face
of the alien flowing like smoke and re-forming into the
glorious smiling visage of Adolph Hitler himself

ALIEN VOICES
VERY WELL YOU SHALL HAVE THE GLORY

-and Hitler’s smile becomes the toothy grimace of a leering
demonic skull Von Grauen starts SCREAMING as Der Fiihrer’s

beyond its capacity and the top of his head erupts as his
life force is sucked out too

ESCALANTE’S “ZONE”

ALIEN VOICES
YOU SHALL BE THE MOST FEARED AND
DEADLY

and the vapor infuses El President reshaping and shrinking
him as he SCREAMS sucking his life force right out through
his pores until all that’s left of him is

OUTSIDE THE CLOUD

--a tiny black and red poison-arrow frog that plops onto the
stone floor in front of Indy and Marion It hops away past
them as they stare in astonishment

The stolen life forces of the three men WHOOSH one-two-three
over Indy’s and Marions heads sucked into the exotic alien
machinery of the column of seats Indy’s gaze drops to

The mummified alien in its seat The machinery is humming
louder now powered by the stolen life forces the fluids
pumping faster As Indy and the others watch the desiccated
flesh of the alien is becoming more supple fuller more alive
In fact the alien mummy is beginning to stirto move

All that remains in the dream cloud now is Yuri

ALIEN VOICES

Indy’s eyes desperately go to Marion’s rifle He grabs it
from her sits up works the bolt

INDY
Cover your eyes

MARION

INDY

‘Cause I dunno what’s gonna happen
--and he shoulders it taking careful aim at
The Crystal Skull Sitting atop the Crystal Skeleton
TURNER
JONES NO
(Indy glances over)
This could be ours Think of the
power Think of the possibilities

INDY
I am

«-and BLAM Indy pulls the trigger
THE CRYSTAL SKULL

is shot right between the eyes EXPLODING into a fantastic
shower of spinning crystalline fragments --

-- an incredible unt o G
light is released The essence of the Gods It pours upward

from the shoulders of the Crystal Skeleton caroming off the
ceiling and blazing in all directions The dream cloud vanishes
with a CONCUSSIVE BANG slamming Yuri to the floor

The essence of the Gods is like living fire ripping through
the air above our heroes’ heads careening off walls blazing
into the column of alien seats and CRACKLING down through its
machinery like live current

QUICK-CUT ANGLES
and the living fire zaps through areas of the ship our heroes

will never see CRACKLING down corridors and BLAZING through
banks of machines that e might be computers activating systems

d ho an e s ak Indy pushes
to his feet grabbing Marion and the others shoving them
toward the door massive blocks of stone now ripping loose
and plummeting from the ceiling

Indy pauses at the door looking back realizing Professor
Oxley’s still back there The old man’s kneeling on the floor
an emptied vessel now too exhausted to rise Oxley looks up
meets Indy’s eyesand smiles He’s fully himself again Not
a wild man Not a conduit Just Vernon Oxley

OXLEY
Indy My boy Run

There’s no way Indy’s leaving him there He dashes back into
the chamber determined to save him but stops as

The alien now more flesh and blood than mummy rises from
its seat tubes ripping free It looms up behind Oxley The
old man senses it turns looks up

The creature reaches down wraps a hand around Oxley’s throat
and lifts him into the air It brings Oxley face to face
vapor swirling between their mouths as it starts to suck
Oxley’s life force out

INDY (0S)
Hey

and the alien pauses turning Indy is shouldering the
carbine taking careful aim finger on the trigger --

INDY
Welcome to Earth

-- and BLAM BLAMBLAMBLAMIBLAMIBLAM He empties the clip
in into the creature driving it back into the shadows Oxley
drops to the floor Indy dashes in grabs him

MARION
Move it Jones

INDY
you‘re the boss

--and they run like hell Moments later the ceiling collapses
behind them sealing the alien away forever

ANTECHAMBER OF ARTIFACTS

The group runs up the aisle as the place comes down around
their ears Chunks of stone are tearing loose from the ceiling
high above letting in daylight plummeting like artillery
shells into the amazing artifacts all around them

LOW ANGLE OF FLOOR

-eaS a tiny black and red frog comes hopping up the aisle
chirping in panic Indy and the others come running up behind

itand Indy’s foot stomps it flat as they pass by

REVERSE ANGLE

as the group races away from us Turner looks back appalled

TURNER
Jones You just stomped the
president of Peru

They keep running as the RUMBLING AND SHAKING grows worse
now a veritable earthquake

MARION
What’s happening

INDY
Something bad We gotta get as far
away from here as possible fast

YURI
How

Indy skids to a stop as inspiration strikes He grabs the
Egyptian skiff wrestling it off its mount Everybody pitches
in pushing and pulling it desperately up the aisle

THE CORRIDOR OF WHEELS

--eand out to the aqueduct where the row of Giant Wheels end
They tip the boat onto the sloping aqueduct wall poising the
prow above the raging rapids They throw themselves in the
boat and slide down swept off in the blink of an eye

EXT THE GREAT STONE TEMPLE - DAY

TRAVELING WITH THE SKIFF as it comes bursting out of a huge
tunnel into blinding beautiful daylight shooting the rapids
everybody holding on for dear life as the Great Stone Temple
drops away fast receding behind them

and in the same shot our CAMERA RISES into the air
tracking them down the thundering river

«and our CAMERA KEEPS RISING further and further up and
up until the skiff is a tiny speck being swept along

«e-and still we rise still in the same shot until we have a
bird’s eye view of the Valley of Dreams below us the cause
of the “earthquake” now apparent we see

Par f the 1 is risi upin enormo sha
perfectly round and a mile wide in diameter The skiff barely
makes it past the edge sailing off down the river as the
disc shape rises lifting the landscape with it -- jungle
ruins everything Whatevers under all that dirt has been
buried there a long time long enough that the city was built
on top of it then thousand years ago

TRAVELING WITH THE SKIFF

as the object rises massively behind the boat straight up in
the air cascading a million tons of dirt and rock raining
ancient ruins and countless trees Indy and the others look
back and in that gray storm of raining soil they get a vague
impression of the underside of the saucer and its mind-boggling
scale -- there’s a trio of round spinning lights each the

size of a football stadium that comprise some extraordinary
and unfathomable propulsion system

The engines are THRUMMING unevenly struggling The saucer
keeps rising straight up a thousand feet now and still
climbing Our skiff is being swept on by the rapids gaining
more distance with every passing moment

and just when it seems the saucer may keep rising forever
the struggling engines fail sending STRANGE BURSTS OF
LIGHTNING exploding outward and spreading across the smooth
underside of the giant alien craft

-and the saucer starts dropping straight back down into the
very pit from which it rose a trillion tons plummeting back
to earth The Gods Themselves are falling from the Heavens

and our group goes sailing over a small waterfall everybody
spilling into the water as the boat flies apart -- and its

the sudden drop in terrain that sayes them because the saucer
impacts with inconceivable force and EXPLODES WITH A NUCLEAR
FLASH that turns the Valley of Dreams into a pit of slag

WIPE TO
EXT TOP OF CLIFF - DAY

«and Indy and the others climb up from the river below
soaked to the bone They turn gazing back The Valley of
Dreams is now billowing into the sky as a MUSHROOM CLOUD

Indy and Yuri look at each other Yuri smilesthen starts
LAUGHING harder and harder

TURNER
What’s the joke

YURI
We We are the joke After all
thatto come away empty handed

INDY
(glances to Marion)
Not empty-handed Not by a long
shot
(to Yuri)
Were alive Older Maybe wiser
That’s something isn’t it

Yuri sees the truth in this He nods offers Indy his hand

YURI
See you around

Beat Marion Turner and Hama trade glances waiting to see
what Indy will do Indy steps forward smilingand nails
Yuri with the all-time haymaker of punches Yuri’s feet leave
the ground as he drops Indy glares down at him intense

INDY
Not if I see you first
(beat)
Stay out of my country

Indy leads the others away Yuri wipes blood from his
noseand starts to laugh He hollers after them

YURI
it was a hell of a chase my friend
Adventure still has a name

INDY’S GROUP

hills behind them As they exit frame WE HOLD ON THE MUSHROOM
CLOUD in the distance

plot that resulted in the accidental
detonation of a stolen atomic bomb

to get through this

neck -- its PRESIDENT EISENHOWER The CROWD CHEERS Eisenhower
shakes Indy’s hand and poses smiling for the FLASHING CAMERAS

EISENHOWER

Indy glances to the side Osgood Turner gives Indy a nod and
a little thumbs-up -- go on pal say something

INDY

Mr President There are only two
words I’d like to say today

CUT TO

INDY

He turns to Marion lifts her bridal veil kisses her
EXT CHURCH - DAY

»and they come running down the steps in a hail of rice to
the sound of WEDDING BELLS

EXT WEDDING RECEPTION - NIGHT

and we find them on the dance floor that night exhausted
but happy dancing to a LIVE ORCHESTRA A FEMALE VOCALIST is
singing “In Old Monterey” Well-wishers keep drifting by
interrupting them with their congratulations

«and as a COUPLE departs Indy’s eyes bug out as somebody
suddenly gives him a crushing bear-hug from behind lifting
him off the ground When his feet land he turns to see

SALLAH drunk and ebullient accompanied by HENRY SR
Sallah’s singing along with the orchestra

SALLAH

“loooongs for the sweetheart
that I left in Old Montereeey”

(waxing rhapsodic)
Oh my friends My heart is bursting
with joy You see

(leans in)
I always knew you belonged together
It was written in the stars

MARION
(glances to Indy)
I guess you could say that

Marion kisses Sallah Henry shoves Sallah aside Indy’s shocked
to find his father also drunk face streaming with tears

HENRY
Loot at them Aren’t they
beautiful

He stuns Indy even more by throwing his arms around him

HENRY
I’m so proud of you son So proud
(pulls back)
--in fact I‘m going to sing a
song at your wedding

INDY
(as Henry departs)
Dad that’s not reallynecessary

But the old man’s gone Indy turns back to Marion with
trepidation They keep dancing Indy glances apprehensively
to the stage as the singer finishes and hands the microphone
to Henry who murmurs to the BAND LEADER The band launches
into the intro of “Fly Me to the Moon”

INDY
I’ve never seen him like that Or
heard him sing before

MARION
Come on I bet he’s not so bad

Indy’s not so sure He glances over and sees

Professor Oxley seated at a table in his tweedy suit nursing
a glass of white wine The old fellow’s looking a bit wan in
the aftermath of his ordeal but is definitely himself again

He catches Indy’s eye raises his glass in a toast Indy and
Marion smile warmly back -- and everybody winces including
Oxley as Henry starts SINGINGboy is he terrible

HENRY
“fly me to the moonlet me sail
among the starslet me see what
spring is like on Jupiter and Mars”

INDY
You lost that bet

MARION
He’s happy That’s what counts

INDY
Riiiight
CAMERA CLOSES IN MOVING TIGHTER AND TIGHTER on our dancing

MARION
Theres something you never told
me Something I need to know

INDY
Uh-oh What’s that

MARION
Back in the Lost City When you
were in that dream cloud What did
you see in there

Indy hesitates trying to find the words

INDY
It was likelike seeing
everything in the universe all at
once Like suddenly knowing all the
secrets there are to know The
meaning of it all

MARION
So Why didn’t you take it All
that fortune and glory

INDY

She looks up at him not getting it By now were VERY TIGHT

INDY
What I saw in my dream cloud

You I saw you You’re my fortune
and glory kid

Marion melts As they come together for a kiss ANGLE DRIFTS
PAST THEM through all the dancing couples

and WE CLOSE IN to find Oxley alone at his table in the
corner unnoticed by all amusing himself by making the
silverware dance and twirl on the table before him like the

couples on the dance floor using only the power of his mind

Bemused and amused he glances up toward the sky

and WE TILT UP off his look to the millions of stars shining
like diamonds above And as a series of SHOOTING STARS streak
across the night sky we

FADE OUT
