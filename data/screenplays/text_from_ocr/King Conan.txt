os MISTSDark stygian mists Moving through them as if floating
rising The great vault of darkness and mists open below to
infinity or something worse

WIZARD (0S)
I chronicle my Lord--Conan barbarian
thief warrior king The world grows
old around me but little changes Man
is born of chaos his plight is struggle
A fight to breathe a fight to Live
then to conquer--And for what Can he
conquer time or even himself

A solitary wind swirls up through the darkness like a spirit
The mists turn and dissipate and reform in its passage

WIZARD (0S)
Man dies and his bones turn to dust
Only stories remain spoken by such
as I

A-light distant but rushing closer flickering rising a fire--
contained but burning from nowhere

WIZARD (0S)
Sit on the ground with me Let the
fire warm you and I will sing of
greed deceit lust and power Ha
But that is not all I sing of loyalty
honor and love Yes love for that is
what makes men foolish or great You
may choose

DISSOLVE TO

THE FIRE--Defines itself--on the ground--frozen ground--a few
meager logs shielded by stones Now a figure is silhouetted
crouching by the fire It is CONAN He wears a sword on his
back He is disheveled and bearded covered in furs The dark
sun now cracks over the horizon lighting his face

TITLE IN THE NORTHERN LAND OF THE PICTS

The landscape is bare--tundra and rock occasional Caledonian
pines--strange trees primordial and solitary A wind has blown
away the mist Conan warms himself as best he can It is a
scene from man’s beginning

cuT TO
CONAN--Walking through the tall bare trunks of a forest again
the strange Caledonian trees Snow and frost covers the hard
ground The land is without remorse of any kind and yet he
hears something--soft--feminine A woman’s laughter

There ahead in the swirls of ground fog a veil A white arm
gracefully beckoning then gone

Conan rushes forward his beard frosted and white with ice He
sees

IN THE ROCKY MISTS--The sensuous outline of a WOMAN--swaying and
moving away from him her hair flowing in slow motion Again her
laugh--this time inviting and seductive

Conan clambers over the rocks his fingers frozen and blue He
comes upon her She sways above him holding onto a twisted
trunk Now he can see her Her face is white as the snow her
lips blue as are her eyes and lashes But her hair is long and
reddish She is at one and the same time deathly and carnal

DAUGHTER OF THE SNOWS
Do you want me

She draws back away behind the trees He climbs up and follows

DAUGHTER OF THE SNOWS
Some say I am the Frost Giant’s
Daughter

She stops and lets him get closer She wears little but gauze
and her form twists towards him She reaches out and takes his
hand Her touch is ice yet it burns She caresses his face
leaving a mark of frost

DAUGHTER OF THE SNOWS
You are one I could love But
first you must fight my brothers

And she turns as two huge white-bearded MEN--clad in frosted
armor and skin as white as death appear Each bears an axe
They come at Conan in a rolling sinuous pace almost flying He
has no choice but to draw his blade--parry a blow-Clang--ice
flies He comes round and slashes through one’s spine and comes
down overhand through the other’s shoulder plate Both scream
like thunder and go down in a cloud of snow

CONAN--Standing in the frost--bloody sword in hand The Woman
lays back on a rock beckoning him He goes to her

BLUE FIRE--Emanating from logs Conan crouches by them his fur
cloak around the girl

DAUGHTER OF THE SNOWS
You must go now You have conquered
cold and desolation but this is the
land of the Ice Worm and here he is
King

CONAN
Then I will kill him too

DAUGHTER OF THE SNOWS
No I have given you my love
Now you must repay me

He hears a keening sound She shakes in terror pulls away from
him and though he tries to grab her she is gone Suddenly he
sees her behind a tree

CONAN
What do you want

DAUGHTER OF THE SNOWS
Bring me the jewels of an Empire
Bring these and I will give you
your son

The keening is louder Something trembles under the ground
Conan looks down--when he looks back she is in the fog between
the trees--then nothing The keening stops The frost melts and
the ground is sure under his feet The sun breaks through the
mists across his face

DISSOLVE TO

An enormous dark blue wave-rising up in a roiling sea--dark torn
clouds overhead--wind ripping spume from its crest We rise with
it and at its top bursts free a dragon-prowed longship Thirty
oars per side The craft crashes through the crest and rides
down at us Standing on the prow is Conan his hair blowing in
the wind ice on his armor Behind him are two warriors with
steel skull masks for faces
WIZARD (0S)
He went west to the sea and became
a pirate His life was pillage and
rapine And then one day on the
eastern border of Civilization-—-

CUT TO

AQUILONIAN TRIBUNE--GAIUS METALLUS--Magnificent in his golden
armor standing atop a stone palisade the steel clad Aquilonian
infantry forming a shield wall below Beyond them where a gate
is built are hundreds of barbarians--Picts Turans Gundermen
Cimmerians Aesir Vanir and yes Conan resplendent in his furs
and chain mail his great sword on his back

METALLUS
Greetings from Emperor Tisus He
the Senate and People of Aquilonia
offer you gold glory and Aquilonian
citizenship if you will fight for us

CLOSE CONAN--He considers the question This is the great
machine of Civilization This is the height and grandeur of
man’s achievement He is a Cimmerian a barbarian an animal who
is struggling through this world by force of will and arms Is
there something to lose

METALLUS
Who will come with me to the East
where the cities are paved in turquoise and
evil tyrants drink from goblets made of rubies
A new dawn comes who will stand with the
Emperor in its light and bear the golden
eagles Who You

CLOSE CONAN--He raises his right hand

CONAN

I Conan will come with you
METALLUS

Why
CONAN

Because I was born on a battlefield
and the first sound I heard was a scream
The others cheer raise their hands cry “Me too” “Take Me”
“I will go” “Why not” --etc

MONTAGE--Helmets of iron crudely resembling one another are
passed to the huge barbarians Along with these are leather
armor and shields Swords and spears are of the same style and
length

METALLUS
You will learn to be as one like
a chain Every link the same and
strong This is how civilized men
make war

CLOSE METALLUS--Walking down the line of shields--pushing one
over--slapping another with the flat of his axe

METALLUS
Look how you pull to the left
because your right is exposed

Sure enough they do

METALLUS
That is because you do not trust
your comrade’s shields to defend
you

He stops at Conan

METALLUS
This is how we beat you This is
how we take your lands and enslave
your women Because you are not
a chain The Line is weak--What
are you Barbarian

CONAN
I am Cimmerian Tribune

METALLUS
And you next to him

A short stocky KILLER--

KILLER
I am a Pict
METALLUS
Wrong

He smashes them back with his ax and separates them--stands in
between

METALLUS
You are a dead Cimmerian and you
are a dead Pict

He grabs the Pict’s shield pulls it across Conan’s front

METALLUS

Now--I cannot get you Now you are
Soldiers--a Line The Line is sacred

a brotherhood It is what sets us

apart as much as art writing music
More Because we are larger than anyone
Stronger than anyone This is Culture
This is Strength This is Empire Belong
to it

CUT TO

THE LINE--Advancing in war Arrows thud into the shields--spears
of the second and third row poise over the first rows of
shoulders Conan is in the first row Hairy mutant looking
Asian forest-men charge screaming--wielding cudgels and hideous
axes and swords They slam into the shields--Conan bears their
shock

METALLUS (0S)
Pila

The spears savagely stab at the hapless savages

METALLUS (0S)
Spatha

Conan lashes out with his sword in a quick measured stroke that
cleaves through a collarbone Bodies slump against the shields

METALLUS (0S)
Advance three steps--Spatha again

Another stroke--into a thigh--screaming and blood spattering
Conan’s helmet
CUT TO
TABLE--Set in a steaming slaughter field--hands grasp at heaven
Faces gape in horror The table is almost on a mound of bodies
Metallus sits in an ivory chair His maroon cape about him his
golden armor tarnished and spattered with gore Jewels gold and
weapons are piled up One by one the mercenary barbarians come
and are paid Conan takes his

METALLUS
Conan

He looks up at Metallus
METALLUS
That is your name The men admire

you It is a gift from the gods

CONAN
I know Tribune Lord

METALLUS
I think you shall be a leader
amongst men

CONAN
Whatever is your wish Tribune Lord

’ METALLUS
Take two shares-

He pushes it across the table

METALLUS
Now you carry the Standard

CLOSE CONAN-Marching behind the Line--carrying the Legion
Standard--a BLACK WOLF’S HEAD A lion’s jaw is over his helmet

CONAN
Hold steady Straighten the Line

Cavalry thunders at them The spears are up straight

CONAN
Spike it

The spears come down Metallus at Conan’s back
METALLUS
At the run--Advance

They howl and charge--all breaking away before them Conan
reaches out with his shield and stops a javelin from hitting
Metallus

DISSOLVE TO

CLOSE METALLUS--In tent He places a chain of gold around
Conan’s neck
METALLUS
Now my friend the Legion is yours
Keep the Line Straight and true

They embrace

CONAN
I will keep it as you would--Where
do you go now Are you leaving us

METALLUS
No--I will not be far from your
side Perhaps you wondered why
I commanded you--Barbarians instead
of Imperial Troops

CONAN
It has only occurred to me that
you commanded well Lord Tribune

METALLUS
I was sent here because no one else
would take this job You see I am
an orphan--a ward of Aquilonia my
blood is common

Then he looks off almost dreamlike

METALLUS
Because of you Conan and the Line
this Legion is now a legend and I--
I am to ride the Public Horse
I am to be a Consul of Aquilonia

He takes Conan’s hand grasps it
METALLUS
These years have been the finest
of my life
CUT TO

A WALLED CITY--Burning under siege--in the midst of battle below
Conan on horseback The whole of an auxiliary battalion of
infantry is spread out before him Smoke and fires obscure the
advance Drums beat slowly A RIDER thunders up

RIDER
Lord Consul Metallus presents his
compliments Lord Conan and asks
that you join in expanding a breach
of the southern wall

Conan looks to his left

A DRILLED CORPS OF AQUILONIAN INFANTRY--A Legion--ten thousand
strong glitter amidst the smoke Their uniforms armor and
standards are far more resplendent than Conan’s mercenaries
Metallus on a white horse holds out his fist Conan holds out
his

CONAN
Thank the Consul for his graciousness
We are attacking now

RIDER
Lord Consul Metallus wishes to add--
no quarter

CONAN
None

Drums beat a pounding hypnotic tempo The battalion advances
CUT TO

RUINED TEMPLE--A ruined smoldering city below Beautiful dark
skinned girls attend to Conan and Metallus who are swimming in a
marble bath Other officers loll about being fed or watching a
ritual dance Still others walk in a garden with tawny long
haired temptresses

METALLUS
What will you do with your spoils
Conan
CONAN
Keep them Sire like any man

METALLUS
For what I give mine away Luxury
wealth only weakens resolve I am
Aquilonian and she is rich enough for
all of us

CONAN
I have a son

Metailus looks at him

METALLUS
You sly bastard You’ve been
keeping a mistress on campaign

CONAN
No--long ago--too many years In
the north Pictland The Daughter
of the Snows She told me to come
back with the jewels from an Empire
and she would give me my son

METALLUS
You have what she asked for Take
leave tomorrow What was the boy
like

CONAN
I’ve never seen him

CuT TO

PICTLAND--CONAN--Alone on horseback--dressed as an Aquilonian
officer He wanders the fens

CUT TO

CONAN-Leading his horse through the Caledonian forest He hears
laughter He stops

CUT TO
CONAN--Crouching by a fire--the light of it glinting off his gold

and steel armor his finely shaved face He is a far cry from
what he was He looks up She sways out of the mist All grows
frosty and white around him He feels the frost on his armor
She leads a three year old CHILD

DAUGHTER OF THE SNOWS
You have taken long

CONAN
It took some time

He opens a polished chest of ebony and out spill jewels of
unimaginable size and brilliance She gasps almost sexually
The boy pulls free and goes and picks up an enormous emerald as
big as an egg

DAUGHTER OF THE SNOWS
I have never seen such as these

CONAN
I have

He touches the enormous glowing stone around his own neck “The
Eye of the Serpent”

DAUGHTER OF THE SNOWS
What about that one

CONAN
It is mine

DAUGHTER OF THE SNOWS
If so the boy is mine How
much do you want him

Conan looks at the boy He looks at Conan his eyes glow like
coals Conan rips off the stone-hands it to her takes the
boy’s hand He comes to him

CONAN
It is only a stone

DAUGHTER OF THE SNOWS
The boy is not yours He will
never be You may take him but
it is the Ice Worm’s seed that grew
in me You only served him that
night as I wished He is the son
of the Ice Worm

CONAN
So be it Enjoy your prattle
Crom is my witness and the boy
is mine

Conan takes the boy into his arms--turns and leaves
cuT TO

CLOSE BOY--Sitting on a shield boots tromp by in the mud Two
huge men bearing kettle drums ride camels towering over him He
looks up at them innocently Suddenly a rough faced ZINGARAN
CENTURION leans down

CENTURION
Who will care for him

CONAN (0S)
The Zingaran Legion will be his
Fatherland--Look

Suddenly boots of wrapped fur are in front of him A sword is
drawn The little boy looks up and sees Conan his father a
plumed helmet of bronze on his head He cuts some wild flowers
from over the boy’s head He drops them on the ground All the
while a deep cadence resounds as troops and wagons move past in
the mud The boy looks at the flowers in the mud--he starts to
lean for them--Thwock The sword quivers stuck point first next
to them The boy grabs for it

CONAN
Easy lad--You’1ll cut yourself

He guides his hands to the hilt

VOICE (0S)
Just because he reaches for a
gladius doesn’t mean he will be
a warrior Lord Captain

CONAN
He is my son Pick him up--
let us go
He grabs him up
VOICE (0S)

What will you call him
CONAN
I will call him Kon

CUT TO

night Buglers blow on huge horns Drums pound Everywhere
soldiers run to positions on the wall

Picts Hundreds of them

An AQUILONIAN TRIBUNE runs by

TRIBUNE
The east wall They’ve come through
the gate

Kon looks to see Horsemen leap over a line of Aquilonian
infantry Hairy dark furred men swarm over the wall shooting
arrows waving hatchets and swords The Tribune screams and
falls to the ground gurgling before the boy The horsemen hac
and hew in the darkness Women run by screaming--a man has hi
hair on fire Suddenly--Conan is there--his powerful form
towering over the child

rain falling An AQUILONIAN GENERAL and his entourage approach
Conan and his Zingaran Legionnaires

wreath of reeds

He is handed a crude crown of reeds--knotted together into a
band

GENERAL
‘Of the earth--it will perish
like man Also like man-one
reed can be broken

He snaps off an end

GENERAL
But woven together they cannot

He places it on Conan’s head Kon looks up from his side

with flutes before them Troops follow behind Central in the

red He holds his hands out to the crowds

CROWDS
Hail Metallus--Imperator Metallus
of Kush--Of Pictland Hail Imperator-—

KON
I thought they lived in the
mountains
CONAN

Our god does He sits on a cliff
in the coid and watches

KON
Can he see us here

CONAN
Even here where the wind is warm
and the smells of food and spice--
where men wear silk and brocade
and women wear little or nothing
Yes he watches us in places like
this

He turns to Kon kneels down

CONAN
Remember how I showed you my
father’s sword

KON
Yes

CONAN
It was not my father’s I broke
my father’s sword with mine He
told me to trust steel not men
women animals I trust nothing
but my will and instinct Trust
no one Boy--not any of this
He gestures

CONAN
If gods live here--they are treacherous
and dark Trust no one but the wind
and the cold night sky Make them
your friends and you won’t need this
You won’t need me

KON
I’‘ll always need you father

Tears fill his eyes

CONAN
No--someday you must break my sword

He turns and leaves as the sun sets behind the hills of Tarantia

GIRLS--Cuman slaves of exquisite form and grace

CUT TO

sensuous walk proclaiming carnality and arrogance

METALLUS
You’ re lost in thought--I’ve never
seen you that way

CONAN
Why not

METALLUS
You are one of direct action only
biding your time between instinct
and the next I often wish I were
like you

CONAN
What makes us different

METALLUS
I am a civilized man Though I
crushed the Revolt of Shem and

their bold
They bring
food to Metalius and Conan who listens to a poet who sings of
great battles while other girls play harps and lyres
conquered holy cities of Stygia
I did it for Aquilonia I have
given myself to her You are
still a free man

CONAN
Isn’t that what we desire

METALLUS
No--only a barbarian needs freedom
A civilized man a refined and finished
man seeks power and power can only
come through something larger than
you An idea a religion An army
or a--State

CONAN
I’m not sure I need power

METALLUS
You already have it and so youve
already compromised

CONAN
Are you so sure

Metallus smiles

METALLUS
Emperor Tisus thinks so and so do
I We want you to become something
greater than yourself

Conan looks at him

CONAN
I’m a simple soldier You taught
me that A link in a chain

METALLUS
No--that’s how you started--No you’ ve
become the chain itself the other
links bind you in place Now the
links are bigger--stronger and you
are linked to Her like me You
can go nowhere--you can only become
something more

Conan doesn’t answer

METALLUS
You must become a King

Conan laughs beckons a slave girl she kneels down offers wine

CONAN
What is your name girl and where
are you from

GIRL
I am Tamra from the Cuman

CONAN
I love Cuman women He says I
must be a King

He turns to Metallus

METALLUS
The Emperor’s wish

He rubs her oiled thigh--she pours wine down his throat

CONAN
King of what

METALLUS
King of Zingara You lead their
Legion You are a hero there already
They would accept a Cimmerian King

CONAN
Who says

Metallus slams his fist down on a plate THe girl pulls back
spilling wine “

METALLUS
I say so Emperor Tisus says so
Aquilonia says so

He smiles and takes the girl’s hand--leads it back to Conan
She runs her hands through his hair--over his shoulders

METALLUS
Show him paradise for an evening

She pulls him back He takes her to him

METALLUS
I give her to you King Conan

CONAN
You don’t trust me Do you

will be raised as you never could
Masters from Argos will teach him
verse and philosophy History will
walk with him to his training at the
Academy of War He will be hardened
and tempered like a blade sharpened
and honed to serve Aquilonia and the
cause of civilization He will be
great Greater than you Someday
he will ride the Public Horse

Conan glares at him

CONAN
There is always a price isn’t there

METALLUS
You should know that

CONAN
Where is he

METALLUS
Would you deny him greatness

CONAN

TITLE MESSANTIA CAPITAL CITY OF ZINGARA

CONAN--HIS ESCORT--Ride through the gates of the city People

line the streets and stare at him but his welcome is cold and
artificial He looks around at their faces He has seen

conquered faces before but now it is he who feels vanquished and
lonely He rides towards a cold and foreboding fortress that is

his palace on a jutting butte overlooking the city shrouded in
mist

armrests Conan walks towards it in a great dark hall The men
and women of Zingaran nobility line a carpet to his destination

CONAN
Tell me the truth Michaes--always

laurel and places it on the pillow from which Michaes has taken

sits back in the throne

CUT TO
THE TWO MEN--Looking across a swift and wide river to primitive

huts on the other side Fires burn in the dusk and candles
light every room on the crowded waterfront But on the other
side of the river there is only darkness and the impenetrable

forests

We are only the width of this
the Black River from the Picts

Conan holds out his hand

CONAN
And to the east another river the
Thunder Beyond it Aquilonia--
Caught in the middle-Zingara so
small yet--

MICHAES
So important--that is why we must
remain strong by ourselves Both
civilization and barbarity want
us--need us

CONAN
The forests--I too came from them

MICHAES
Beyond this river men are beasts
They will never be civilized and
they will never be conquered

Conan stares at the forest beyond the Black River

CONAN
For years I defended those beyond
the other river against all that
lives in that forest-beasts--man
or magic

MICHAES
That is why you are here You know
the Picts--You know both rivers but
when it is dark without a moon--
Conan looks at him

CONAN
Which do I drink from

He looks back across

METALLUS--Reading the letter Conan has written He is at the
Academia Martius He watches the boys train with staffs and
shields

CONAN V0)
Every day I beg them to return you

A white-bearded SCHOLAR leans to Metallus

SCHOLAR
Which is he

METALLUS
The savage boy--Kon

SCHOLAR
He is strong of body and will
The others know it They hate
him but it is good for them

He puts the letter in an oil lamp where the parchment quickly
burns

METALLUS
But tell him I was here

CUT TO

FIELD-Where they train with long staffs--padded at either end
like a Marine’s pugil stick except they are as long as the
spears of the phalanx Felexio and Fortunas spar--Fortunas
charges and disarms Felexio and beats him to the ground despite
the other’s speed and size Fortunas is an immensely talented
fighter a golden boy

FORTUNAS
Now you Clivus and the Zingaran
Prince--Kon

CLIVUS is nervous as he is only a toady to his patrician
friends and Kon is growing more solid and formidable He hefts
the staff with cold precision and awaits the spoiled Aquilonian

FORTUNAS
Engage

Clivus thrusts and Kon parries tying up the shaft moving coming
round with the butt he slams Clivus in the head shortens his
grip and spears him in the face Clivus rolls on the ground
crying
FORTUNAS
Excellent--but you’ve insulted an

Aquilonian patrician We can’t
allow that

CUT TO

KON--Being held by Felexio while Fortunas beats him--slapping--

punching--round house kicks

FORTUNAS
Good--You Clivus-—-Continue

TEACHER
--And when Ruta Numantio charged
at the Battle of Galba what was
his mistake

STUDENT
But Numantio won and slaughtered
the Iragans His whole career was
made in that hour

TEACHER
Wrong He disobeyed He ovutran
his position

Prince Fortunas stands
FORTUNAS
There are times when one is so well
trained and motivated when a man
needs a higher standard and knows
he can attain it Then victory is

his and he must take it Numantio’s

charge at Galba was what built what
we are

TEACHER
But Fortunas--it was impetuous

FORTUNAS
Yes but it was successful We
must learn to take the initiative--
if we are able

Kon stands Fortunas looks at him Kon is as big as Fortunas

now and built heavier like his father His face has become

mysterious--stoic The Teacher nods to him

KON
Numantio is a hero to every boy
I adore him but Numantio broke
the Line at Galba The Line is
sacred

TEACHER
He is right--and so are you Prince

Fortunas But Kon is not a patrician

he must think like a soldier
Fortunas smiles at Kon
FORTUNAS
How can I reach the glory I aspire
to without comrades like Kon I
salute you Cimmerian

Public Horse and be a Senator It’s
not impossible

CUT TO

CONAN--OLDER--Walking through the temple with the priests of each
religion conferring blessings upon him He wears ridiculous
robes and is embarrassed by the whole thing aside from feeling
guilty in Crom’s gaze

CONAN (V0O)
Son have you learned of the
ways of man and his many gods
Crom forgive me--What god do
you pray to I am well I have
wealth beyond my needs--

AN ARMORER--Fitting a new breastplate another handing him an
engraved and gold inlaid sword He tests its balance He’s not
impressed with it and hangs it in a sack with a collection of
swords

CONAN--Walking alone through his palace He looks tired and has
gained a little weight He carries a flagon of mead at his side

CONAN (VO)
I’ve still not heard from you
Perhaps they do not let you write
me I’ve grown used to the silence
I’ve all I need
He looks through gauze curtains into his seraglio where his
concubines are screaming at one another One slaps another--
pulls her hair

CONAN (V0)
How can I complain Is it not good
to be a King I am satisfied

They see him and transfer their anger to him The lonely Tamra
hurls a vase that catches in the curtains Conan puts up his
hand and retreats

CUT TO

CONAN--Alone on the throne--the hall empty a young girl asleep
at his feet He gazes out into the darkness

CONAN

CONAN--Walking up the beach to a crude pavilion of stones furs
and canvas lit by torches Great carpets have been laid down
and a throne of wood and antlers erected on which sits the
Pictish King ORLOCK MAC MORN He is surrounded by his favorite
warriors dark and hulking painted in tattoos with red hair and
dark pitiless eyes These are people who do not like the light
of day Barbarous and sinister they recognize a kindred spirit
in the new Zingaran King A chair is brought to Conan--he sits
The WIZARD himself now steps forward from the Pictish contingent
clad in robes of fur with Gaelic design

CLOSE CONAN--He looks at the Wizard--could it be

CONAN

MAC MORN
You know him

CONAN
Yes--What do you want

MAC MORN
Weapons of steel and friendship

MAC MORN
You would not be afraid

CONAN
Fear is for other men I have
fought you long enough

MAC MORN
When you die--we want your heart

CONAN
And I yours

MAC MORN
Then we are brothers Let us
sign in blood

custom

ceramic jars

CONAN

WIZARD
These are poisons--so you must be
careful--the finest of the lands
of the East where men are fond
of poisons

DISSOLVE TO

CONAN--Standing before a wash basin of turquoise The Wizard
pours into a stone cup

WIZARD
Up to here-no more--every morning

a year you’ll be hardened to anything
Then we start the others

Conan takes it frowns and gags

CONAN

What do you expect It is poison -

DANCER--A Nemedian girl dances in a local tavern She is young

moves with natural grace as if she would dance no matter who
watched

Indeed someone is watching The boys from the Academy amongst
them Kon now seventeen He still has that air of mystery about
him it gives him an older experienced calm The other boys
throw coins at the girl but she eyes Kon As she dances closer
their eyes fix and then

FORTUNAS
Wench Over here

Her head turns as does Kon’s Fortunas is behind them with a

SENATOR
Weapons of steel We cannot

Metallus slowly rises

METALLUS
--I was going to ask that his
son be returned upon graduation--

TISUS
Never Makeshim an instrument

SENATOR
He should serve as you have

OTHER SENATOR
We should kill the father--Invade
Zingara--the effrontery

Metallus turns glaring

METALLUS

CONAN--In his chariot with spears attending the Royal Hunt
drives his chariot up to the trackers who have cornered a lion

being held at bay by ferocious mastiff-like dogs

He draws a

He

javelin At that instant another chariot arrives pluming dust--
Metallus in it with a javelin Conan leaps down from his

METALLUS
Careful your Highness

Conan sees the beast as it leaps atop a rock It is a saber-
toothed cat maned partially like a lion Conan looks at it his
weapon ready to cast

CLOSE SABER-TOOTH--Looks back at him its eyes yellow and
slanted

CONAN--Lowers his javelin

CONAN
Pull back the hounds

The cat seems to know The dogs are leashed Conan flicks his
head and the cat understands and leaves in a bound

METALLUS
Why

CONAN
There are few like him anymore

He looks at Metallus

CONAN
So I have displeased them Did
they send you to punish me

METALLUS
Would they send a friend

CONAN
Yes

He climbs back into his chariot--

CONAN
I’ve brought peace to this part
of the world

METALLUS
Peace is relative--there are many
who do not sleep well even if
you do

CONAN
I care not how they sleep

He replaces the javelin

METALLUS
For everything there is a balance
You let the lion live so some poor
man’s cattle must die You are at
peace with the Picts yet Aquilonia
is afraid We are not--

CONAN
Barbarians

METALLUS
--Unreasonable We must set the
balance right

CONAN
What would do that

Metallus turns away looks at his polished fingernails holding
the javelin--sets it back

METALLUS

helmet

KON

LEGIONARY
But nothing happens here

KON

He walks on

CUT TO

CONAN--Riding in a chariot reviewing the Legion He is getting
gray in his hair and beard and though he’s a little paunchier
he’s still a formidable figure At his side are his Aquilonian
keepers-the Imperial Cavalry--behind are Michaes and the Wizard
He rides up to a delegation of Aquilonians surrounding a covered
sedan-chair He stops

AQUILONIAN CENTURION
Greetings King Conan May we present
the new Aquilonian Magistrate

He turns to the chair

CENTURION
Your Excellence

At that a beautiful hand--graceful and feminine wearing rich
rings pulls back the shade--a graceful foot ankle and long leg
follow The curtain parts to reveal an EXQUISITE WOMAN of stern
patrician bearing but still hinting of Aquilonian sensual
depravity She smiles mysteriously at Conan

CENTURION
Countess Zulieka

Conan is astonished that they have sent a woman a beautiful one
at that He dismounts his horse He is about to reach out his
hand--hers is suddenly there for him to take

CONAN
Excuse me my Countess but I did
not expect-—

ZULIEKA

The alternative is unthinkable

CUT TO

CONAN--On a balcony overlooking the Black River The lights

in windows far below and sparkle off the water The sound c
lutes and tambourines drift on a soft night wind It blows
silken curtains behind him He wears no crown Below far

struggling failing grasping as man always does He turns he

He steps in

Disguise me-so that I can go--
down there

CASTLE GATE--Conan in the rough clothes of a farmer or herdsman
a small crude dagger on his belt His face is unchanged

CONAN
No one can see me--who I am

WIZARD
No one Sire--It is a spell that
will last the night

He turns and leaves

WATERFRONT--Conan striding along the rough waterfront area
watching merchants sell stinking river fish meat from fly
infested butchers and rotting vegetables Conan drinks in the
mess because even if it’s rot--it is life He sees men arguing
whores beckoning from doorways--gambling dens and ale houses all
awash in filthy humanity No one notices him Indeed he has a
good Wizard

CLOSE CONAN--Sitting listening to fishermen cargo boatmen
traders He carries a wooden staff

TRADER
New taxes--now they have a tax
on wine
FISHERMAN
I drink ale to hell with wine What

TRADER
He’s theirs He wears their leash
drinks their wine

col --Walking through a back street--he sees a MAN turning a
beeve on a spit--basting it It looks good other beeves veals
and pork hang roasting or smoking along with great sausages
Conan savors the smell and feels for his pouch around his waist
He takes out a golden coin thinks twice about it and puts it
back He walks up to the BARBEQUE MAN

CONAN
I’m hungry--I’ve--I’ve got
no money

The Barbeque Man looks up--looks him over

BARBEQUE MAN
How’d you get so big being so poor

CONAN

The Barbeque Man smiles at his honesty

CUT TO

PILE OF HEWN LOGS--Ten feet high--hardwood hickory--an axe is
stuck on a stump Conan looks at the ax Picks it up hefts it
looks around No one is watching he spins it--catches it whips
it around his body in a sort of kata

LOG--He raises the blade slices clean but the pieces are not
even He sets another up

MONTAGE Axe blade splitting logs shaving off sides--sticking
as well as splitting--finally cutting evenly without effort

CONAN--Standing sweating--shirt off axe in hand He looks like
Conan again He has lined up five logs checks to see that no
one is watching and proceeds to go through the logs with short
precise strokes often shortening his grip then slamming the wood

down to break it apart It is done with rhythm and speed--
obviously a combat drill The last log leaves a thin piece
standing--Conan turns away then whips around in a vicious
backhand not looking and splits the piece perfectly His hands
are blistered There is still most of the pile left

CUT TO

CONAN--Gorging himself with brisket and sausage--grease running
down his chin his body aching from good work and his hands rough
and scabbed He belches--lays back to sleep

DAWN--Conan chopping wood as the dawn sparkles off the river
water The city is asleep and only the sound of his axe carries
out over the water The pile is done

CONAN--Holding out a bruised hand to the Barbeque Man He puts
two silver coins in it

BARBEQUE MAN
Took you long enough But you
cut well

He turns and walks away toward the hill with the castle in the
distance The Barbeque Man watches him and scratches his head

CUT TO

CONAN--Asleep in his chamber in sweaty clothes--stretched out on
a rug snoring The sun is out

cuT TO

CONAN--On throne--a delegation of Aquilonians are before him He
seems distracted and though the Countess Zulieka is speaking he
looks at her strangely

ZULIEKA
Already we have rumbling of
discontent--guarded insults to
our soldiers--inferior service
and price gouging from certain
merchants We will not tolerate
insult

CONAN
Why not We all tolerate insult

He stretches
She stops

He laughs

ZULIEKA
What do you mean by that King

CONAN
I’m sore today--last night I did
a man’s work

ZULIEKA
I’m not interested in tales of
your depravity These town people
are insubordinate--surly

CONAN
You look fetching today Countess

CONAN

There-Are you embarrassed Better

My people do not like to have their
sons drafted to fight your wars

ZULIEKA
Your men are good at it

CONAN
Dying So that Aquilonian mothers
need not cry

ZULIBKA
You never hesitated to serve

CONAN
I had ideals The chain the
Sacred Line Who would not
die for that

He looks off--wistful

CONAN
But of course I’m different--

He looks lustfully at her

CONAN
I am a barbarian

Come back when you can spend
more time

She leaves Michaes steps up

Wizard--I’1ll go again--tonight

WIZARD
What did you find there Sire

CONAN
Work

He stretches again

KON--On horseback as the Cavalry burns a Tauran
line of refugees moving before him

KON
Have them fed but give them no
extra It is not my intention
that rebels should fatten on State
grain

CENTURION

LEGATE
The Emperor--he has taken an interest
in you

KON
We were classmates at the Academy Sir

LEGATE
You’ ve been promoted to the Praetorian
You are to be one of the Emperor’s One
Hundred

Kon doesn’t know whether this is good or bad considering the
source of his promotion

LEGATE
Are you not pleased You are
a barbarian You’1l be called
Publius Kon from now on Keep
it up and you may ride the Public
Horse That’s as far as a man of
your birth can go

KON (to himself)
Quite an honor Sir

CUT TO

NIGHT--TARANTIA--The Via Venuvia where the palatial homes of the
richest patricians overlook the crowded subura below and the
river that snakes through the great city Metallus walks to a
chariot awaiting him An IMPERIAL GUARD stands ready He gets

on the chariot and is whisked away

SUBURA--The streets are narrow and crowded--dark and choked with
smoke and trash The chariot clatters over the cobblestones

GUARD
Get out of the way Make room
for the Consul

People look up--Metallus strong eternally distant The chariot
stops by the river

METALLUS
Here

GUARD
Yes Consul

Metallus gets off--walks down a path to an arbor overlooking the
river lit by many candles At a wide place he sees couches and
pillows a figure reclining upon them All around in the shadows
are guards glinting of steel and bronze Metallus walks forward
to the figure--a man in a purple toga He bows

METALLUS
My Emperor

Young Emperor Tisus Alba Fortunas looks up

FORTUNAS
You wonder why I brought you here
To this filthy place Notice the
air is freshened here from the river

He claps and two handsome young men appear in ceremonial armor

FORTUNAS
This is the finest brothel in
Tarantia A secret

He indicates with his hand and the two men select weapons from a
female attendant--sword shield spear Fortunas claps again and
a BEAUTIFUL DARK-EYED WOMAN glides in and goes to him Metallus
leaps to his feet

METALLUS
Excuse my impropriety since I had
no idea--the Empress was present
She looks at him coldly She is THEODESIA from Nemedia whose
beauty is only surpassed by her cunning and ruthless ambition

THEODESIA
Are you surprised Consul to find
a wife at such a place Perhaps
you have heard that my husband
found me under these circumstances

Metallus swallows

THEODESIA
Have you heard that Consul

METALLUS
Yes my Empress

She smiles seductively

THEODESIA
Good you’re at least clever enough
to be honest when you are unsure

She looks over and the men begin fighting-this is for real--
swift brutal spear thrusts and parries--desperate

THEODESIA
Do you enjoy watching men fight
Consul--I do

FORTUNAS
Life is a struggle We do not grow
without pain We do not emerge--
become

METALLUS
We must

THEODESIA
The same of the State If Aquilonia
is to reach its true place of dominance
it must--fulfill--potentialize

One of the men thrusts his spear into the other’s leg The man
screams in agony and drops his spear but still screaming he
draws his spatha(sword) and cleaves through the offending shaft
He pulls the point from himself and hacks his opponent’s wooden
shaft to pieces advancing and making him draw his sword

tn

FORTUNAS
One can never be sure of one’s
relative position

He draws an engraved dagger of priceless workmanship--its
heat-blued blade glinting like a diamond

FORTUNAS
Steel Consul This is what we
must concern ourselves with
Responsibility Prudentia We
are the heirs to great civilization
We are responsible to the world for
its art its culture its lLanguage--

THEODESIA
--And government Why are we here
if not to govern to rule

FORTUNAS
--And today--it is so difficult
Any nation or tribe can possess
weapons of steel It is a terrifying
new world

Metallus sits up

METALLUS
What do you want Sire

FORTUNAS
Zingara-—

The fight is loud with clangs of blade on shield and desperate
grunting and breathing The wounded man has pushed the other
back into the shadows He smashes with his shield swipes at th
head knocking off his opponent’s helmet Theodesia gasps
knotting the fabric of her clothing in a clenched hand She
stands--steps closer to them She is breathing fast Fortunas
ignores her--leans in close to Metallus

FORTUNAS
One comes to places like this to
buy pleasure In time one tires
of a favorite That is why it is
wise to only pay by the night
Never possess Let them worry
about their age beauty sweetness
of breath and skin I only pay
by the night
2

The wounded man slashes wildly landing a blow to the other side
which is instantly crimson They reverse positions Theodesia
kneels closely a hand clasping her grommet at her breasts The
wounded man slips on the bloody stone surface enough time for
the other to chop down between the shoulder and neck He pulls
his sword away as the other stands straight up screaming in
surprise and drops his weapon He staggers about holding his
neck and goes to his knees moaning and bleeding Theodesia
rushes to the victor who holds his side with his free hand She
throws herself around him her wispy costume stained and clinging
to her She kisses him though he gasps for breath He runs a
rough hand over her thigh

FORTUNAS

But sometimes there is one more
valuable enduring One that demands
possession Then it is unthinkable
for other men to have her Then it

is love and a man if he is a man
must have all her favors If he loves
her he cannot breathe without her

Fortunas leaps to his feet--rushes at the couple--Theodesia ducks
aside as Fortunas thrusts with his dagger The gladiator avoids
it--comes back with an overhand stroke with the spatha This
Fortunas parries easily with the dagger and traps the fighter’s
arm with his He wrenches it expertly spins and stabs the
slayer under his heart where the armor stops The man cries out
stiffens and falls Fortunas takes Theodesia by the wrist--pulls
her to him She kisses his hand arm neck He keeps her at bay

FORTUNAS
I must have Zingara I must have
her and all her favors--iron mines
smelters weapons of steel

THEODESIA
Can we let these things proliferate

METALLUS
Me Why me

FORTUNAS
Because we are in an era of
discontinuous change and you
are the King’s friend

METALLUS
You don’t trust me This is a test

THEODESIA
All of life is a test

They both stare at Metallus

FORTUNAS
Last month I sent him a gift--
Countess Zulieka Next month
I shall send him another--his
son

THEODESIA
Gifts make a slave like the
whip makes a dog

CUT TO

NIGHT--CONAN--THE ROYAL BEDCHAMBER--Conan is drunk laughing in
the distance on his bed He is carousing with a woman They can
be seen in silhouette--occasionally the light of the torch
flashing on their flesh as they writhe on the bed A wine flagon
clangs on the stone floor the sound of their breathing and
gasping filters through across the floor to the doors where
Michaes stands--he closes them He has the hint of disgust more
accurately disappointment on his face The doors close--we
cannot see who it is with Conan--a beautiful woman now atop him
swaying and moaning in rising pleasure As we get closer a
flicker of light reveals it is Zulieka Magistrate to the
Emperor

CLOSE ZULIEKA--Her pleasure is real uncontained but behind it
is the hint of a deeper agenda the gasp that hides a smirk of
one who is most satisfied with deception

CUT TO

CONAN--At his grand table He is signing a law Various viziers
and clerks fuss about The Aquilonian contingent behind a
coldly imperious Zulieka watch from a distance Michaes watches
over Conan’s shoulder

CONAN
You’ve been silent Michaes You
do not approve of this tax

MICHAES
The people have never been taxed
on grain before Sire

Conan whirls around He goes back to the document

CONAN
The people are rich one of the
richest provinces of the Empire
Everyone is taxed on grain

MICHAES
When I was born we Zingarans
were not part of an Empire

CONAN
The world has changed since we
were born

CUT TO

TROOPS--Marching away under palace walls They are the Zingaran
Legion they bear the Black Wolf Head’s Standard Conan’s
standard They gleam in the late afternoon sun fhe kettle
drums pound Conan watches from a balcony used for reviews He
watches the Legion march under the Arch of Mitra toward the city
gates and the road leading east At his side is Zulieka He
catches himself--looks around at the temptress whose eyes flash
at him

CONAN
Now go and send your Emperor
word that I have obeyed

ZULIEKA
You shall be rewarded--tonight I
will show you the gates of Paradise

CONAN
Not tonight I am tired

ZULIEKA
You’ve tired of me

He doesn’t answer
CLOSE CONAN--BALCONY--Sipping his poison

CUT TO
THRONE--He sits alone in the dark mists swirl around him He
sees the face of his son looking up to him from behind a shield

in a battle scared--needing him Then he sees his son held on
the battlements of Tarantia tears pouring down his face Then

swaying before him is the Daughter of the Snows the mother of
his child He stands reaches for her but she glides away
laughing and he is holding frost

DAUGHTER OF THE SNOWS
Your seed did not bear fruit It
is His seed

She laughs and disappears and Conan is holding his scepter He
is alone in a darkened throne room A few attendants watch from
the door He throws the scepter down

CONAN
Guards--Get me the Wizard

CUT TO

GRAND CHAMBER OF THE EMPEROR-TARANTIA--Publius Kon Cimmericus
Officer of the Praetorian One Hundred the Emperor’s One Hundred
is surrounded as he walks up the deep purple carpet over the
marble floor to the Emperor’s curile chair of ivory The Empress
Theodesia is at his side in a similar chair He salutes and
bows

KON
Publius Kon

FORTUNAS
Kon Why we haven’t talked since
school days I’ve followed your
career noted all your decorations
You might call me a fan Fine record
though you could have used a little
combat But we are all not so lucky
Not like Felexio here

The huge dangerous Felexio of school days has become a darkly
menacing professional who looms behind the throne in black armor

FORTUNAS
You remember Felexio--Why he’s been
in one battle or another since he
graduated

He watches Kon’s reaction which is none

FORTUNAS
Always at my side
KON
I’ve followed your illustrious
career too My Emperor

FORTUNAS
So good to watch someone you know
evolve--materialize

KON
My humble gratitude Emperor I
only serve the State

FORTUNAS
No youre more You see you’re
not one of us

Kon’s eyes look down

FORTUNAS
We do this because we are born
to it You serve by choice I
admire you Publius Kon That is
why I am sending you home

Kon looks up confused

KON
Home Sire This is my home

FORTUNAS
Your father is King of Zingara
We have interests in acquiring
Zingara as part of the State
How would he feel about that
Or you

KON
My father gave me to Aquilonia
Sire The army is my country

FORTUNAS
Good then you are to be Military
Tribune to Gaius Metallus who will
be Prefect When a transition is
complete the Empress and I will
visit and confer Imperium
THEODESIA
Does this trouble you Publius
Dealing with your--past It would
trouble me

KON
I’m sure I will learn from it
Empress and be a more useful
servant

THEODESIA
Well stated--you have a beguiling
manner Tribune See that we talk
sometime
CUT TO

AN AXE--Slicing through a log--clop--the pieces fall--another
clop--another piece Conan stands by the river watching the s
pass below the dark forest on the other side The axe rests
easily in his hands He hears the murmur of fishermen below--
occasional words filter up--“Occupation--Grain tax--Bread-
--Sweat--Injustice--Damnable King”

CONAN--Walking through the town feeling the silver coins in hi
hand He carries a heavy staff which he has carved with
intricate patterns He comes to a group surrounding a man
wearing an old Legionary tunic He has one eye an old vetera
Young people surround him

VETERAN
I wear my decorations always

He points to his eye

VETERAN
Does the King pay my rent or give
the bread I was promised No

Conan stops

CONAN
Why not--the King feeds all veterans
All men who fought for Zingara

VETERAN
What about the Shemite Succession
or the Vilyet War The Aquilonians
call them police actions--not wars
Well--this happened while I was
policing the Shemites
Me

CONAN
I served in the Vilyet War--with
the King He was good to me

He shows his coins

VETERAN
What unit were you with I was
in the infantry I don’t remember
you I think you’re lying

The others jeer him Conan glowers but walks away

CLOSE TWO TOUGHS--Both wearing swords on their backs poor
brigands They noticed Conan--especially his coins

CUT TO

INN--In the crowded subura of the town Conan goes in The
place is full of Aquilonian soldiers on leave and the usual
pimps and whores as well as working men looking for a good meal
and a drink of ale

CUT TO

FLAGON OF MEAD--Placed before Conan with hot sausages and meat
He sits in the corner away from the crowd He sees a shapely
BLONDE WOMAN from behind serving others She reminds him of
someone long ago--she is obviously the proprietor since people
call to her and know her She directs other girls and young men
in the serving Conan strains to see her face but there is so
much smoke from the cooking pits and she is in silhouette He
takes his small dagger--cuts a sausage Flies buzz around him
He grabs out with lightning speed and catches one He strains to
see the woman but she disappears behind others He doesn’t see
the two criminals who’ve followed him here He looks at his
fist--opens it--the fly crawls on his palm He blows on it and
it flies away

CONAN--Paying a servant girl with one of his coins that he takes
from his pouch He’s placed the staff on the table and doesn’t
notice that suddenly the two thugs are at either side seated
with him

THUG
What else you got in that sack Sir

Conan looks to one first then the other

CONAN
Are you hungry

THUG
I am Gothio a slayer of men
and what if I was hungry

Conan reaches for the knife--they show the blades of their
swords and slide one over Conan’s hand

GOTHIO
Not so fast

Conan moves his dagger slowly indicating the sausage

CONAN
There’s plenty

He lets the dagger drop on the table A fly buzzes around them
Conan’s eyes follow it They look at him Conan’s hands lashes
out so quickly they don’t even react until it’s back His fist
is closed He opens it--a fly--

CONAN
The same one

He blows--it flies away They watch--it buzzes around

CONAN
He won’t go away

Now they are wary--downright scared The fly buzzes and stops on
a thick support behind Gothios head He turns his face to see
it crawl They all watch it Suddenly a blur of Conan’s hand
and the dagger sinks into the wood where the fly was It buzzes
off The Tough gasps as the dagger vibrates for a second

CONAN
Don’t worry--I wouldn’t even hurt
a fly I just scared him

He reaches out pulls out the knife The Thugs gasp and flee
Conan cuts the sausage

CONAN
There was plenty

CUT TO
A GIRL takes his flagon to be refilled She hands it to the
Blonde Woman near the barrels Conan strains to see her Now
the Woman turns and Conan’s heart almost stops His jaw goes
slack for the Woman looks exactly as he thought she would
Exactly like Valeria the only woman he ever loved--dead for ove
twenty years The Woman is probably twenty years older than
Valeria was but she is still strong and handsome of feature
Conan is intent on the Woman She seems to notice and looks at
him The serving Girl comes back

CONAN
Who is that woman over there

GIRL
Aeldra She owns this place
She takes care of us

CONAN
Where’s her husband

GIRL
Her husband was a soldier in the
Legion Killed in the Vilyet War

CLOSE--He turns away behind his flagon Only his eyes furtively
look back--he broods behind his mead

CLOSE AELDRA--Brings a large earthen amphora of wine out and
hauls it towards a group in another dimly lit room Suddenly a
strong hand grabs one of the handles She looks up into the dark
face of Conan

CONAN
It is heavy

She pulls up her side They take it toward the room

BELDRA
I saw you watching me There are
younger and finer here and I’m
not for sale

Conan doesn’t say anything They enter the room--a bunch of
working men young and old A few have their women with them
They surround a TOGATED MAN big once powerful with long gray
hair wild blue eyes He drinks from a skin Conan looks Aeldra
in the eye

CONAN
You remind me of someone--

AELDRA
--Long ago--I know I always
remind men of someone

They set the amphora on a low table others grasp it and tip it
to pour wine in many cups Conan helps

GRAY-HAIRED MAN
Careful--there’s a tax on that wine

AELDRA
I didn’t pay it

She leaves looking over her shoulder at Conan who watches her

MAN
You fancy Aeldra Stranger All
of us do It’1l do no good Where
are you from

CONAN
The Black River-the other side

MAN
Lived with the Picts eh --That
don’t matter Have you met--our
leader

CUT TO

THE GRAY-HAIRED MAN--Eyes fierce with fire looking right at us

GRAY-HAIRED MAN
“You lolled in gardens where breezes fanned
The blossom’s shivering shard
But we were bred to the naked land
Where life was bitter and hard
You raped the grapes of their purple soul
For your wine cups brimming high--”

He stops breathes and drinks his wine
GRAY-HAIRED MAN
“--We stooped to the dregs of the muddy hole
Bitter sweet with alkali--”

All sit around him transfixed by his ease of delivery
GRAY-HAIRED MAN
“--Trade your freedom for harps and lutes
Discard the sword and the dart
Then build a prison of satin and gold
And call it Culture and Art--”

Now Conan sits forward and says the lines along with him

BOTH
‘“--Then lie in the laps of smiling land
Till its rusts unman and rot them
And they scorn their blood of the calloused hand
And the fathers who begot them”

All are silent

CONAN
You must be Herodion

HERODION
I am--and you

CONAN
Just a man who admires your songs
They’ve kept me company--good company
when I am alone

HERODION
A poet can be no better paid Thank
you Sir

The woman Aeldra looks over the others at Conan he’s more than
just another in this place He catches her gaze she turns awa

HERODION
Do you wish to be free to live
-a Man To stand instead of kneel

CONAN
As all men--only more

HERODION
Then I ask you--Are you willing to
stand alone--even if it means your
death Even if no one knows

He looks to all of them

HERODION
What can one man do How can one
stand against Empire And what if
your act is futile

He stands up

HERODION
Meaningless --Because first it
must be one and then another Until
you are all willing to stand alone
and fail--There can be no revolution

He looks around past Conan into all of their eyes

HERODION
Weve talked of plans--schemes-—
We’ve complained of the King--
of the Aquilonian Legions--But
it is no more than my songs

CONAN
Your songs are as great as men--

HERODION
No They are just songs Are
you willing to stand Stranger

Conan stands up slowly

CONAN
I’m willing

HERODION
Why

CONAN

Because--“My knotted hands still clutch at life
Still like a shoreless sea

My soul beats on in rage and strife

And you cannot shackle me”

Conan reaches his hand out--Herodion takes it

CUT TO
CONAN--Alone at a table-brooding over his cup All the others
are gone It is late--almost morning A few couples grope in

the shadows A drunk snores on a table Footsteps Conan looks
up--Aeldra with an amphora of wine
AELDRA
Maybe I can fill your cup

CONAN
I drink ale like a man

AELDRA
You don’t look like a man prone
to poetry

CONAN

Life is strange--
He looks up at her--she sits next to him

CONAN (soft)
“And I saw as I clawed that evil snake
To slay before I died
Unruly golden hair that tossed
In wild and untamed pride
Her slim foot pressed the foe-man’s chest
His proud head back was thrown
Matching the steel she held on high
Her eyes in glory shone
I saw the gleam of her golden hair
And her eyes like the deep gray sea
--And the love in the gaze that sought me out
Barbaric fierce and free--”

ae

She leans closer to him-cannot do otherwise

AELDRA
What--what happened to her

CONAN (quiet)
“--Then the darkness fell and the sky as well
And the mists closed over me”

They look deep into each other but get no closer She slowly
backs away as does he

CONAN
It is late--the dawn--

AELDRA
Will you come back

CONAN
Yes
CUT TO
CONAN-STREET--Alone walking in the shadows towards the distant
palace on the hill The narrow streets are empty The town
sleeps He moves in the shadows carrying his staff Suddenly §£
hears a woman scream He stops

STREET--Far ahead A figure is thrown to the ground A MAN
stands over the figure--kicks at it light reflects off armor

MAN
You’ ve insulted me

The figure is a WOMAN--small compared to the man She scampers
away He comes after her--closer

MAN
A Pictish whore

He kicks her hard in the ribs She wheezes air--and rolls
gasping Now we see it is an Aquilonian Guard from the
occupational Legion He is drunk She is young and clad in
furs She gathers herself up--puts her hands up weakly He
looks around to see if anyone watches No so he draws his
glinting gladius

WOMAN (gasping)
No--Please--

He leans over her grabs her dark hair Suddenly he is pushed
back by the end of Conan’s staff He looks up in shock He see
the figure of a big man in the moonlight but the man is unarmed
no plate steel on him He grabs the end of the staff holding i
with his left hand

GUARD
Who are you Varlet

Conan doesn’t answer

GUARD
You’ ve touched an Aquilonian

But Conan’s eyes glint wolf-like with no understanding For a
second this cruel soldier sees something primordial and
frightening--barbarous as remorseless as nature

GUARD
Who are you She’s just a
Pictish whore
aed

CONAN
I’m her King

The Guard now smiles in his superiority over this amateur He
laughs and with that cuts across the staff with his razor sharp
blade It splinters and a piece falls Conan whirls it back
smashing the Guard’s wrist with the heavy end--the gladius flies
sparkling in the moonlight Before it clatters on the stones
Conan crosses the stroke shifting the grip and comes down on
his helmet with the carved heavy end Clunk--it caves in
Another whirl sliding step and he jams the sharp splintered end
into the underarm devoid of plate armor A sickening wet sound
and then the Guard lets out a gagging scream kicking his feet
going to his knees as blood courses down his face from under his
helmet Conan withdraws the staff The Guard clatters face down
on the stones She rushes to him

GIRL
Quick--someone will come

She grabs his hand--they run into the shadows of a narrow
passage

CUT TO

CANDLE--Being lit--other candles reveal a small room hung with
furs and strange Pictish symbols A WITCH sits before a low
fire Conan looks out a fur curtain--the sky is getting light in
the east Conan sits before the old woman the girl off to the
side

WITCH
My daughter’s name is Diera
she brought the soldier here
so that I could tell his fortune
We are Picts

CONAN
What happened

WITCH
He had none You’d better go
before it gets light Someone
will recognize you

CONAN
You know who I am
WITCH
Didn’t you tell Diera you were
the King

CONAN
You believe that

WITCH
Too bad you don’t Go before
it gets light

Conan gets up--backs to the door and looks out-—he goes

CUT TO

HERALDS--Blowing horns as the Imperial Guard of the Prefect Gai
Metallus Marula enters Metallus his twelve Lictors as well a
Kon and a military escort enter Michaes and others await them

METALLUS

his whores

MICHAES
He wasn’t aware of your arrival
I have sent the Lady Zulieka

METALLUS
Then let me know when she returns

CUT TO

ZULIEKA--Looking distant but attractive She bears herself as
the countess she is--but slightly disgusted by having to wait
while King Conan splashes water on his face He turns

CONAN
Metallus

ZULIEKA
Yes Sire and the new Military
Tribune They wait in your hall
Further Sire there has been an
act of rebellion A soldier of
the Frontier Legion has been slain

CONAN
Where When--Did people see it

ZULIEKA
His body was found this morning
The new Tribune will conduct an
investigation He should interest

you

CONAN
Tribune--What is another Tribune
to me

Zulieka smiles with sadistic satisfaction

ZULIEKA
His name is Publius Kon

Conan whirls about

CONAN
Kon

ZULIEKA
Yes do you know him

CUT TO

CONAN--Rushing into the Great Hall wearing only his Zingaran
toga His footsteps echo as he approaches the Aquilonian
entourage now including Metallus Kon and the darkly menacing
Felexio and several huge Praetorians Conan sees the figure of
Kon--standing straight clad in iron plate and chain mail his
helmet held at his side It can only be him

CLOSE KON--His eyes burning like when he was a child but he
doesn’t move from the “at rest” position His eyes blink however
and he lets out a controlled gasp

CLOSE METALLUS--Turns and looks at him He composes himself

CLOSE CONAN-Eyes on fire mouth agape he literally stumbles
forward

MICHAES

Conan comes face to face with Kon They stare at each other

CONAN
Kon--Do you remember what I told
you Do you--Son--Do you remember
your father
Kon’s eyes flutter

KON
Always

Conan lunges forward--throws his arms around his son--but it i
like embracing a tree

CLOSE KON--Using all his discipline and stoic training to keep
from showing emotion Conan’s face is stained with tears and
can only say “Kon--Kon--” Kon’s eyes moisten but that is al

METALLUS
Fine figure of a soldier isn’t
he One of the Emperor’s One
Hundred A Tribune

Conan lets go--steps back--looks in Kon’s eyes but they are n
hardened as is his way

CONAN
Why --Why did I never hear from
you Whatever they’ve done to you
you’re still my blood--Barbarian blood

METALLUS
You’11 have much to discuss but
it is unseemly to do so now There
are matters that must be dealt with
You each have your duties

Conan awash in emotion tries to get a hold of himself He
staggers back sits on his throne

MICHAES
Your crown Sire

He places it on his head Conan touches it

CONAN
I must have forgotten

KON
They say you gave a lot for it

This goes to Conan’s heart He sits back wounded looks to th
others

CONAN
What are the Praetorians doing here

METALLUS
They are here to make Zingara safe
for the Emperor There is much unrest--
instability Revolution in the wind
and terrorism That we cannot tolerate

CONAN
And you are here to help me

METALLUS
I’ve always been at your side Conan
Michaes bring chairs so that we can
discuss a course of action

DISSOLVE TO

MESSANTIA--STREET--RIOTS--A wagon filled with amphoras is
attacked by an angry crowd An Aquilonian merchant tries to
defend it He is swept aside--beaten The ceramic jugs are
broken Many scoop up the wine and drink it

AN EFFIGY OF THE EMPEROR--With an Aquilonian helmet is nailed to
a cross and set afire--around dance young drunken men and women
tearing at each other’s clothes laughing and screaming in anger
and lust

They do not see the far end of the street Aquilonian
Legionaries assemble carrying their heavy shields and pilum
Metallus pulls up in a chariot looks to Kon who sits ona
horse He nods

CLOSE KON--He pulls down an angelic solid silver child mask over
his face That gives him the emotionality of a statue--it is
part of a Cavalryman’s helmet He barks commands extending the
Line

KON
On me--Shield width--Tighten it
Visors down --Forward

They march a drum section follows--beating out cadence Their
spears aloft

THE CROWD STOPS--Sees a wall of shields coming--hears the drums
Herodion amongst the crowd yells

HERODION
There --They’ve come to put the
yoke on you Now Now we answer

He throws a heavy piece of pottery People emerge from the
balconies roofs--pull up tile--grab potted plants

LINE--Being pelted from the front-occasionally an arrow thuds
into a shield but the Line closes the distance Now the heavy
objects rain from above a man falls--another his helmet rolling
under their feet Kon dismounts-draws his gladius

KON
Front Rank-Spike it

The pila come down--points sparkling

KON
Other ranks--Tortuga

The shields come up protecting the others--the Line slams into
the crowd--soldiers spear people with short brutal thrusts--
always advancing A woman screams--goes down clutching her
breast Men are speared through the face--mouths and eyes being
preferred targets Herodion hurls a cleaver The crowd breaks
and runs Herodion in their midst Many are trampled and then
speared to death by the soldiers

CLOSE METALLUS--Watching with satisfaction

METALLUS
That should quench any flames of
revolt Never question authority

CUT TO

METALLUS--Sitting at a table in the center of the street He is
on his ivory chair People are brought to him for questioning
Behind stands Kon behind the silver curls of his cupid mask
blood on his sword arm Bodies are being hauled from the street
and stacked in a wagon

METALLUS
Who found the Centurion

ZINGARAN WOMAN
‘We all did when we came out in
the morning

KON
Was he robbed

MAN
No--He had coins in his pouch

METALLUS
How do you know

MAN
I saw the soldiers count it later

METALLUS
After you took what you thought
wouldn’t be noticed

CLOSE METALLUS--From below--towering over on the ivory chair an
image of authoritarian rule

METALLUS
He was murdered

ANOTHER ANGLE-—

METALLUS
Who are the ringleaders Who
brought you here today

CLOSER STILL--

METALLUS
What good did it do you

Metallus standing up--

METALLUS
Do you think we want this

A MAN--Old scared sitting at the table Metallus leans closer

METALLUS (quietly)
We know he was with a girl His
comrades told us A Pictish whore--
dark hair--small graceful Tell us
her name--we will find out anyway
and then we’1ll remember that you
said nothing

A WOMAN--Injured her face wrapped in gauze She is somebody’s
wife mother She shivers as Metallus regards her She looks up
at the serene metal expression of Kon hands clasped behind his
back in his silver armor
ST

TWILIGHT--CAMP--On the outskirts of town--below the castle Here
is camped the Frontier Legion Tents extend around the base of
the hill behind an earthen guarded wall Metallus stands outside
a command tent Kon at his side

METALLUS
Well we’ve done a day’s work--We’ ve
protected the Imperial Line--another

day

KON
I sense a bit of cynicism Gaius
Metallus

METALLUS

Cynicism--me But I ride the
Public Horse I’m just tired
The faces look the same after
all these years Even this
place--it might well be fifty
others

KON
But it is not It is Zingara

METALLUS
Will you see him
KON
The King
METALLUS

Your father

KON
You like him don’t you More
than you would admit
METALLUS
We fought the Line together I
saved his life Mitra knows how
many time he saved mine I was
the--happiest then--if you could
call it that Ironic I’ve had
many women More pleasure than
anyone deserves but I never took
a wife Aquilonia that bitch
was mistress to all of us She I
serve and love But a man should
be allowed a friend Don’t you
think I suppose it’s soft-—-
unprofessional but when you get
older you get tired

He turns--looks at Kon who walks away

TENT--KON’ S--He unties his heavy breastplate lets it fall down
on his cot He drinks from a wineskin--sees an ORDERLY standing
outside

KON
Yes--Come in

ORDERLY
Tribune Sir--a girl wishes to
see you She says you’ve been
looking for her

KON
A girl

ORDERLY
Yes Tribune Sir--a Pict

CUT TO
DIERA--Pushes the flaps of the tent aside She has obviously
dressed in a Zingaran wrap for the occasion She is small but
of a lean and curvaceous figure Her eyes are like dark pools o
oil Kon is seated He looks her up and down she knows it

KON
Be seated

CUT TO

KON--Pouring himself a full cup of wine He looks at the cup
then at her She has curled her legs beneath her on a rug
KON
You’ ve never seen this man before

DIERA
No--nor any like him

KON
What was his most striking feature
besides being big and strong

DIERA
The way he moved I ama Pict
Our men move differently than
townmen He moved like that
The soldier had no chance It
was done before he struck

KON

Have you seen him again
DIERA

No
KON

Were you afraid of him
DIERA

No
KON

Why not
DIERA

Because you look like he did
He saved me In his heart he
was one of--us

KON

Don’t make that assumption of me
DIERA

‘Why not --You do not know your

heart

Kon smiles Is she trying to interrogate him Still
something drawing him to her but she is just a woman

there is

KON
You said there was something
else he said to the Centurion
Will you tell me now

He leans closer puts his iron hand over her wrist she slithers
to him

DIERA
I will tell you when I feel it
is right

She leans against his knees--runs her hand up his arm

DIERA
My gods would scorn me--for what
I do Do you have gods

KON
No--only Aquilonia

DIERA
A man needs gods--he needs something
he cannot understand

She rises like a snake to him He takes her in his arms and

kisses her deeply The cup of wine falls and spills on the
floor

CUT TO

FIRE--Through the flames of his tent cooking fire we see Kon and
Diera writhe on the furs

-CLOSE DIERA--Her head on his chest breathing in gasps

KON
Tell me what he said

DIERA

Why --He--he said--
(she breathes)

He said he was the King

CUT TO

BATTLEMENTS OF THE CASTLE--It is dark night Conan sits on a
stone like Rodin’s Thinker He stares down at the city where
fires flicker and sparkle A full moon casts its reflection off
the waterways
CONAN
“Shadows and echoes haunt my dreams
With dim and subtle pain
With the faded fire of lost desire
Like a ghost on a moonlit plain
In the pallid mist of death-like slee
She comes again to me--”

We see he’s not alone The Wizard sits against a)

CONAN
“I see the gleam of her golden hair
And her eyes like the deep gray sea”

He looks at the Wizard

WIZARD
Did Herodion write that too

CONAN
No I did

The Wizard says nothing for a moment

WIZARD
You’ ve learned much in the years

CONAN
I’ve had the time

He looks sharply at him

CONAN
What does it mean Has she come
back Would the gods give me another
chance

WIZARD
It’s just a woman that looks like
her No one comes back--and the
gods--they do not favor you

CONAN
Yes--my son is proof of that

WIZARD
Don’t blame the gods for it

CONAN
Not Crom
a

He looks up in the sky

WIZARD
Do you still believe in gods

CONAN
Yes--not all-but Crom

WIZARD
Perhaps you’ve lost him Drifted
far from him

CONAN
Make a spell so that I can be
disguised tonight

WIZARD
There is no need

Conan stands

CONAN
Why not

WIZARD
You’ve grown so far from them
“that they wouldn’t know who you
are
Conan looks at him--down at the city and back at the stars

WIZARD
Maybe Crom doesn’t know you either

Aquilonian’s cantonment Metallus snores contently on his cot

oblivious to the drama that the night holds Beyond is seen Kon

expected Kon stops for a moment Diera reaches out touches his
cloak his impassive form He is a soldier again but she knows

more

DIERA
Tomorrow-—

KON
Perhaps

He watches her go down into the streets that flicker of coal
fires and candles

CUT TO

DOCKS--A group of rough men assemble some are armed with daggers
and cudgels A lone figure stands on a small pier They
approach him He turns to them he is a huge man of imposing
build and shows no fear He too wears a cloak he looks up from
its folds It is Felexio the slayer

FELEXIO
Is this all of you

One of the thugs that accosted Conan in Aeldra’s Inn steps
forward

GOTHIO
I’m Gothio I’ve killed men with
my hands You can count on me

FELEXIO
You don’t look impressive

Gothio signals and a larger group emerge from the shadows They
surround the little pier weapons silhouetted yet Felexio is
cool to it He waits looks them over At the forefront is
Herodion

HERODION
Are you the Nemedian

Felexio whistles and oars are heard Some of the men crouch and
ready their crude weapons Felexio smiles condescendingly at
them

FELEXIO
No need to fear Trust me

A boat comes out of the darkness silhouetted in the moonlight
It is a longboat filled with men A rope is thrown to Felexio
and he pulls it in Four or five big men leap gracefully to the
pier all cloaked in robes but several are carrying round
Nemedian shields Into the light comes a black cowled figure
FELEXIO
Gregoria Bey of Nemedia

Light shines on the face of Fortunas the Emperor

HERODION
Why would a Nemedian Bey want to
help Zingarans

FORTUNAS
The struggle against Aquilonian
hegemony and oppression is all
mankind’s You must be Herodion

HERODION
I am

FORTUNAS
I’ve marveled at your work for
Many years It is an honor Sir

He reaches Herodion pulls him to him embraces him
little too bold but it gives Fortunas the edge

FORTUNAS
Right now there are Nemedian Armies
massing in the North Our ships can
sail down the Black River and be here
in days Now is the time Brothers

MAN
We might be trading one dictator
for another

HERODION
You are a strong nation rival to
Aquilonia We are little people
What will you do if we succeed here

FORTUNAS
What have you got already Slavery
No I can only give you gold and
weapons I can’t make you believe
me That you must decide

GOTHIO
Let’s see the color of your gold

It isa

ad

Fortunas turns to him with his wonderful unspoken contempt for
such trash

FORTUNAS
Of course-—Felexio--Show them

A barrel is rolled on the dock--from nowhere Felexio flashes a
heavy sword from out of his cloak splitting it open It rolls
across the dock spilling gold coins that leave a glittering
trail Fortunas puts his booted foot up and stops the barrel
before it rolls into the water

Another couple of Praetorians in black robes haul out a rolled
rvug--let it flop open--glittering swords axes plate armor

HERODION
What is our course of action

FORTUNAS
The King must die

He goes and picks a sword from the pile a brutal blade of the
northern realm He whirls it then turns it over across his
forearm hilt toward Herodion

FORTUNAS
Weve friends amongst the guards
Tomorrow night at the low moon

Herodion takes the sword

HERODION
The Aquilonians

FORTUNAS
We’11 close the gates They can
do nothing By dawn you will be
King with a Nemedian army sailing
down this river to do your bidding

He leans in close

FORTUNAS
Are you afraid poet

HERODION
Death to tyrants

CUT TO
CONAN--Alone in Aeldra’s inn He eats from a plate of food and
broods over his mead Her shadow passes over his dark
countenance His eyes find hers as she stands looking down at
him

AELDRA
Who was she

CONAN
I thought I would never see you
again until my death Then if I’d
lived well and never yielded to
another’s will then Crom would
send you--wearing a winged helmet
you would reach down and take me
from the slain

He offers his cup to her
CONAN
We would drink sweet mead in the
great feasting hall of Crom and
warm ourselves by his fire

She sits next to him drinks from his flagon

AELDRA
And then--

CONAN
And then--you would look up--and
kiss me-

She does--they embrace alone in the deserted inn They hold
onto-one another increasing in their passion as if this is the
only chance they will ever have as if this has been preordained
but will not last

CUT TO

DAWN--MESSANTIA-The city is just awakening The castle darkly
looms over it Camp and cooking fires are lit in the Aquilonian
camp

CUT TO

WOOD--Being split Conan enjoys the dawn splitting Aeldra’s
logs She looks out at him from building a fire

CUT TO
KON--Walking the palisade checking the guard He comes upor
Metallus who looks out over the town

KON
Good morning Consul A spring day

METALLUS
Something is wrong I don’t know
what but I can feel it

Kon looks out at the river

METALLUS
It’s just a notion but notions
have kept me alive

He turns to Kon

METALLUS
There’s going to be a rising If
not today then tonight Double
the guard and put the Second Cohort
on alert

CUT TO

KING’S BED CHAMBER--Michaes pushes open the door--walks in
one He is followed by the Wizard

MICHAES
No one has slept here

WIZARD
Perhaps the King has a girlfriend

MICHAES
He could or maybe he just got tired
of this place--If he isn’t back by
noon I11 notify Metallus

CUT TO

HILL--Overlooking the thunder River to the east Felexio and
Praetorians ride out of the forest and look down Far in the
distance many barges are set on the river Fortunas rides u
a splendid white horse still cowled in dark robes like the
others
Y

FELEXIO
Someone is going to cross the
river my Emperor

FORTUNAS
Reinforcements

FELEXIO
But we have already sufficient
force to crush-

FORTUNAS
Wrong You can never have enough
force my friend Victory rides
with the gods and they prefer the
heavy Legions Force and overwhelming
power are what history is made of
The War Gods favor the Seventh Legion

FELEXIO
The Black Seventh You are taking
no chances Sire

FORTUNAS
Why should I--By that thought--I feel
it is imperative that the King’s son
Publius Kon should not be here to
make any claims on the throne

FELEXIO
He could be alerted to the assassination
plot and die in the struggle

FORTUNAS
Yes as a good Aquilonian soldier--
at the side of his mentor Gaius
Metallus

FELEXIO
The rider of the Public Horse
A Consul

FORTUNAS

He has served too long He is
loyal to the State but he no longer
compliments the emerging landscape

He turns his horse

FORTUNAS
The Empress travels with the Seventh
By Mitra do I miss her She is the
wood by which I burn Tomorrow she
will have a new province

They ride off the hill
CUT TO

METALLUS--With Michaes and the Wizard in the King’s hall Kon
walks in

METALLUS
He could be kidnaped or poisoned

WIZARD
I don’t think so Not poisoned
I’m a Wizard I see things The
King enjoyed disguising himself
and going amongst his people He
is comfortable with them It is
harmless he will be back soon

METALLUS
Harmless While rebels plot

KON
I have an excellent intelligence
source in the town

CUT TO

DUSK--THE BLACK RIVER--Conan by himself walking along the bank
The waterfront is somewhat quiet It is a spring evening and the
river itself flows smooth dark and peaceful Conan goes to the
edge picks a rock up and skips it across the surface He
watches the splash and ripples go by in the current He is more
at peace than in a long time Yet his instincts tell him that
peace is not in his future or his past He throws another stone

CUT TO

NIGHT--Kon walks through the narrow streets only he is not in
uniform He wears the simple tunic and trousers of a merchant
but at his side is the ever present gladius Even dressed this
way people give him a wide berth Like his father Kon is always
formidable His blood shows He comes to a dwelling looks at
the sign--knocks

CUT TO

KON--Sitting before the old Pictish Witch Diera serves him wine
from an amphora

DIERA
I told you he would come

WITCH
My daughter has powers over men
even strong men like you Tribune

KON
If she has power it is because
I will give it to her willingly

He reaches out takes her hair in his fingers There is a rough
worldly way in this but not without genuine emotion as well

KON
Now tell me Diera where can I
find the man who saved you

DIERA
The King

KON
Yes

WITCH
Why

KON

Because he is a rebel and killed
an Aquilonian

WITCH
Lies Do you not think I can’t
see the blood in your veins Why
do you feel an unreasoning lust
for my daughter You would take
her now and run your hands over
her hips if I were not here
Admit it

He braces himself in his stoicism But she is right

WITCH
You think I see nothing I ama
Pict and my daughter is a Pict--
So are you

He glowers at her

WITCH
You seek this man--this man who
saved my daughter’s life so that
she could sleep in your bed This
man who risked all because of a
Pictish girl--Who took life in an
instant This man is King and he

is your father

She laughs a witch’s laugh Diera goes to him He puts his arm

around her

He thrusts out his other hand and quiets the Witch

KON
Then you tell me where he is

She looks right through him

WITCH
His life is in danger They
wait for him

Kon stands in anger

KON
Who Where

WITCH
Where he sleeps

CUT TO

NIGHT--INN--Conan stands at the door No one is there He sees
a shadow turns--it is Aeldra

CONAN
The others Where is everyone tonight

AELDRA
They have gone to kill the King
Herodion all the young men The
die is cast

CONAN
How
AELDRA
Traitors in the castle Nemedian
The King dies

Conan steps to her grabs her shoulders

CONAN
Whatever happens tonight you
remember me as you have known me

She holds him

AELDRA
Why--Where are you going

CONAN
To what I deserve

He leaves She wants to cry out after him--she listens to his
footsteps running into the darkness

CUT TO
WIZARD--In his chamber lighting a candle

CONAN
Wizard

He turns startled

CONAN
Summon Michaes no one else
Meet me in the Great Hall

THRONE--Conan eats from a bronze platter as always Michaes and
the Wizard sit around him In the distance glide servant girls
and a few courtiers The guards stand at doors

CONAN
They will not come till all
are asleep There must be no
witnesses no interference

He looks at Michaes

CONAN
If you trust me and love Zingara
you must do as I say
MICHAES
I do Sire

CONAN
You must flee now--slip out while
no one watches Take three extra
horses-—-ride to the East and bring
back our Legion Tell them what
has happened here

MICHAES
I’ll send a trusted man--two

CONAN
No--they will only believe you
You must command them Kill
their Aquilonian officers and
return by forced march Whatever
you hear let nothing stop you

MICHAES
I would die here at your side

CONAN
I know--but--we’ll see who dies

Conan nods--Michaes gets up and goes Conan pours some wine
drinks it

CONAN
Here we are again Wizard Two
against many

WIZARD
I’m not so young anymore
CONAN
Then you better conjure up some
powers
He sips
CONAN

Who gave you this wine

WIZARD
The Lady Zulieka bought it for
you She asked if you needed
anything else

CONAN
It’s filled with spider poison
and has hints of black Lotus
Light--with no body

He drinks it down
CUT TO

METALLUS--Pulling on armor while Kon stands outside his tent
fully armea carrying a heavy faichion as well as his gladius

KON
Shall I pick a trusted squad

METALLUS
No--we would alert the assassins
We’ll use the palace guard when we
get there

He grabs a spatha throws his heavy regimental robe around his
shoulders Kon does likewise--they head off towards the moonlit
castle

CUT TO

STEEP HILL--Leading to the highest wall About twenty men move
along the precarious trail Herodion leading He looks up--eight
or ten more men in mail and helmets stand up suddenly Felexio
is prominent He towers above them with a huge sword on his back
and a bow in his ‘hands

FELEXIO
From here we climb

He looks up--claps his hands A rope is thrown from a high
window

HERODION
Who are these men

FELEXIO
Mercenaries--Slayers for hire
You think we would leave it all
in the hands of you amateurs
curt TO

HALLWAY--Outside the King’s chamber

THE GUARDS--All but two march off They look around nervously
CONAN--Watching them through a spyhole in the stone

CONAN
Only two guards remain Traitors
Well it must be time

He turns to see the Wizard with a spear in some ridiculous
ancient helmet

CONAN
Is that the best you can do
Hide under the bed

WIZARD
Thank you Sire

He goes to do so Conan throws off his toga revealing a gleaming
breastplate and mail tunic He reaches up where an old war-axe
is crossed with a shield and sword on one of the great marble
pillars He takes the shield and axe--thrusts the sword into a
potted palm and goes to his bed lays down

curt TO

NIGHT--HILLS--A Shepherd tends his flock in the pass of pines
along the Road of Kings--the paved road from Aquilonia to Zingara
and the exotic south The Shepherd watches as suddenly all his
sheep stand at once and start bleating His dogs steady them but
their panic grows and then he hears a rumbling in the ground--a
shaking like a distant slow earthquake

CLOSE SHEPHERD--He rushes about in panic and now the rumbling is
more rhythmic and precise He looks at his sheep and down the
moonlit road that is suddenly dark in the distance--the darkness
moving towards him He too like his sheep runs in panic

CUT TO

LOWER GATES--Kon and Metallus walk through saluting the guards
and enter the castle

CUT TO

HALLWAY--The assassination party passes stealthily rushing from

pillar to pillar Felexio urges them on--when they have passed

he pulls back a curtain--Fortunas in black armor with an upraised
black cupid mask

FORTUNAS
Now send for Kon and Metallus

Two Praetorians in state armor go and eight more take up
positions guarding the hallway with shield and pilum Felexio is
gone--Fortunas follows

METALLUS--Climbing up a dark spiral stairway He looks out a low
doorway Kon follows

METALLUS
No guards You are right

CUT TO

THE ROAD OF KINGS--Filling with darkness that as it approaches
glints in the moonlight defining itself into the shapes of shield
bearing men--darkly clad--six abreast--marching to a thunderous
cadence made only by their booted feet Ten thousand men--coming
down the Road of Kings filling it like an endless throbbing
reptile No drums no sounds just the tramp of men shields on
their backs coming on inexorably

CUT TO

CLOSE CONAN--Snoring--stretched out on his bed a cover thrown
over him from which protrudes his bootless feet and legs He
rolls on his side--snores loudly oblivious to the door that
creaks open A wind goes softly through the room blowing silken
curtains across dark figures clutching raised sharp glinting
weapons They creak through a cloud of silk and approach the
marble pillars of the royal bed A slayer raises a spear--steps
gracefully out of the silk

Conan’s hand flashes down and an object flies--clank A heavy
dagger pierces the neck of the man who lets out a horrible long
gargling scream Another rushes forward wielding a heavy
cleaving blade--cuts through the brocade hangings and is met by
Conan’s shield He rolls off the bed grabbing the sword from the
palm A quick up-thrust under the arm of the assailant--a blade
flashes--caves into Conan’s cuirass at the ribs He gasps--hurls
the sword at the man and grabs the axe

CLOSE--FELEXIO--He fires a shaft--Conan ducks behind a pillar--
the arrow glances off and into someone’s face

HERODION--Rushes forward sword in hand A huge man who was a
slayer in his youth--he swipes at Conan
HERODION
Here--take him Do you run from
me despot

CLANG--The blow is parried--Conan backs into the moonlight
Herodion sees his face

HERODION
You

CONAN
Herodion Don’t let this happen

Herodion charges in swings a great stroke with both hands

HERODION
Die Tyrant Death to Tyrants

Conan is‘only able to parry the stoke incompletely-the blade
cleaves into his rib cage--bending the plate--Conan gasps in
pain blood spatters out over his hand as he shifts the blade in
a whirling motion and cleaves down through Herodion’s shoulder to
his heart Blood spews over him as Herodion bellows like a bull
going down Conan wrenches the axe free spins around chopping
another through the stomach and cleaving again in rage An arm
holding a sword pinwheels through the air catching on the silken
gold brocade and staining it

CONAN--Back to the wall spreads his legs spins the axe around
him in his deadly kata--comes to rest ready He stares out at
them--hardened men outlaws mercenaries soldiers--all are
cruel inured to the thick blood spattered and pooling under
their feet Immune to the cries of pain and gasping of death
they look at Conan--eyes gleaming He is not like them He is
not from civilization His ferocity is natural like a bear or
tiger and it has no limit They hesitate

CONAN
Who dies first
CUT TO

ROAD OF KINGS--Now filled with the passing Legion Its standards
are dark bronze--an upraised hand skull and eagle’s wings--
Legion VII Rapacio(Rapacious) It’s motto “Let the Gods Show
Mercy” Its men move ahead at the speed of a forced march
faceless in black armor heads down--points of the pila gleaming
in the moonlight The very ground shakes

CLOSE SHEPHERD--Crouched by some stone watching the procession
from Hell pass Again--no orders no drums as if the Seventh is
a machine

CUT TO

DOOR--Metallus pushes open a heavy wooden barrier--they emerge
onto the outside battlements and all can hear a clang and thunk
of a weapon cleaving followed by a scream--more metal sounds and
yelling come from a dark stairwell They rush down it pulling
their swords

CUT TO

WIZARD--Under the bed sees feet and legs moving frantically--a
body lays in a gleaming pool Conan’s feet are bare--he leaps--
Crash The bed shakes as he bounds over A man falls in the
foreground wearing a helmet that is caved in The Wizard twists
around--booted feet close by facing Conan’s bare feet on the
marble floor--they thrust and parry the clangs heard overhead
The Wizard reaches out and pulls one of the booted feet so that
the man slips going to his knee Slang An axe chop and the
body falls headlong away--Conan is gone

CUT TO

CONAN--His face half soaked in shiny blood from a head wound

His arm gashed and his side leaking red down to his feet He is
gasping for breath but holds the axe ready--his back to a pillar
of black polished granite He moves around dark enemies
crouching and close around him

MERCENARY
Take him at once

OTHER THUG
He is weakening

CONAN
When the wolf at the top of
the hill is hungry--

One moves--Conan whirls the axe shortening the grip and traps
the blade in the curve of his He turns it back wrenching the
sword from the man’s hands and spins it up and cleaves down
through the man’s breastplate A mist of blood hisses from the
man’s lungs as he sinks to the floor

CONAN
--The food is always there

Another two men thrust with lances--driving Conan back--an arrow
whistles through his hair Suddenly a scream from the outer
room A clanging crash They turn--a body falls shaking It is
Metallus with his small round shield and falchion He wields it
expertly taking out another Behind him Kon stabs a cloaked
figure then beheads him as he bends over

DOORWAY--FELEXIO--In cowled hood and wrap masking his face sees
that the tide is turning Several shrouded Praetorians are
behind him

FELEXIO
Withdraw

They cover themselves and duck back into the shadows

CLOSE KON--Goes after the closest to Conan Engages one with the
blinding speed of the gladius and cuts him down--parries the
other and sidesteps so that he and Conan are at the pillar
together almost back to back The assassins again hesitate

KON
Come on

Conan looks over at him His son a bloodied sword flashing in
the moonlight by his side Emotion floods across his face his
eyes are swimming pain throbbing through him

CLOSE CONAN--Through the blood and sweat a tear runs down his
cheek He sees Kon feint at one of the killers the man’s guard
comes up Kon goes under and chops him across the leg and
withdraws just as quickly The victim screams and rolls
twisting in the blood on the stone floor The others turn and
run Metallus rushes in from the other side--two men drop
weapons and bows Kon pursues the others out into the hall
Conan leans against the pillar sinking slowly Metallus is over
him

METALLUS
We’ve survived again my friend
Are you wounded badly
Conan holds the axe up at the hallway

CONAN
My son

CUT TO

KON--Rushing down the hallway oblivious to danger Suddenly he
finds himself alone A wind blows on the lamps that barely light
the darkness voices are heard in the rooms women crying men
questioning Footsteps far away running Kon relaxes his neck
feels cool he senses something The near lamp flickers and goes
out

Suddenly he whirls around ducking something swishes over his
head a blade He turns and sees a tall dark robed figure
wheeling a halberd(bladed spear) expertly and coming back for
the opposite stroke He parries with his hand supporting the
blade of his gladius--Clang--the gladius is broken-his left hand
cut--he rolls--sees spears on the wall across a shield leaps in
and kicks his opponent at the end of his stroke sending him back
He rolls up and grabs a spear spins away as the halberd blade
chops through the shield Now the two face each other in
darkness They both have staff weapons

They assume positions the other countering perfectly Swath

A stroke cleaves across Kon’s armor cutting his tunic sleeve
He thrusts--Cling The man is well guarded with black plate
Another feint--an attack metal clanging--then he closes
reverses his grip and slams his opponent in the head with the
wooden butt on the staff The man staggers back countering with
a riposte that cuts Kon’s cheek and ear Kon arches out of the
way and spears the man in the face only to have the blade glance
off the black cupid mask that is revealed They stand there for
a second Then the opponent backs into the darkness and cannot
be seen

FOOTSTEPS--Metallus with Royal Guards runs toward him down the
hall
METALLUS

Tribune
He sees Kon--spear pointed at the darkness

METALLUS
Where Tribune

He sees and a guard grabs a lamp off a wall rushes forward
The dark corner is lit by the flickering flame It reveals
nothing save the black shape of a doorway

CUT TO

SHEPHERD--Standing as the rumble of footsteps fades away The
sheep run around him bleating He looks down the road a thin
wispy trail of dust begins to dissipate in the blue moonlight
Soon it will be as if nothing passed this way at all

CUT TO

METALLUS--KON-Striding down hallways weapons brandished their
feet leaving echoes off the stones

CLOSE KON--He feels his shredded ear They hear footsteps--boots
on the pavement coming up stairs--from the other direction behind
them cries of alarm as pages and attendants rush to the King’s
aide

METALLUS
Halt Who are you
MAN
I’m the cook Sire--Is the King
all right
OTHER MAN
What is this blood on the floor
KON
The King lives--fetch the royal

physician
A couple of pale GIRLS from the seraglio look around the corner

GIRL
The Master

KON
He is alive--go back to your room
He will need you soon enough

From the other direction come a large force of armed men in dark
cloaks As they emerge from the shadows they see Kon Metallus
others They cast back their cloaks revealing Aquilonian armor

of the Praetorian Guard The Emperor’s favorite lackey Clivus
stands mouth agape

CLIVUS
Consul--How did you get here

METALLUS
I came in the back way

CLIVUS
We heard there was an attack on the
King Is he alive

METALLUS
Very much so He is not easy to
kill Lucky we came though--

KON
How did you know

CLIVUS
A page looked for the guards--there
were none so we suspected a plot-—
We sent for you--
(to Kon)
Tribune How did you know

KON
A Witch told me

He turns and goes back into Conan’s chamber as Metallus talks to
them He sees the Wizard binding Conan who sits on his blood
spattered chair Bodies litter the floor Several physicians
rush to him--blood still runs from fresh wounds He is pale He
turns’ his head to see Kon

KON
Father

Conan smiles
KON
Are you wounded gravely Sire

CONAN (to Wizard)
Am I going to die

WIZARD
Probably not

CONAN
Then I am still King

He pulls himself up--barely and teeters dizzy with pain and loss
of blood He pulls his axe--shiny with crimson holds it at his
waist

CONAN
I am King And by this axe I rule

DISSOLVE TO

CONAN--Sleeping deliriously wrapped in bandages--soaking in red
He rolls on his bed while the Wizard sits in his chair mashing

opium Conan’s harem try tend to him rubbing his shoulders
patting his head with cold soaked compresses The Wizard leaves
goes to the door and sees

KON--Sitting alone in the hallway in armor Kon seems to be
meditating but looks up calmly at the Wizard

KON
He is better

WIZARD
He will be--
(hears drums)
What is that

Trumpets sound distantly

KON
The Emperor and Empress They are
entering the city with the Seventh
Legion

CUT TO

DRUMS--Pounding slowly on camels--standards--skull eagles
upraised hand--the biack brocade cloth banner of the Seventh
Rapacio At the head clad in golden muscled cuirass and bare
headed rides Fortunas a golden wreath on his golden hair At
his side also in sensuous golden armor bare-thighed and hair
blowing behind her is Theodesia She wears a gladius at her
side a band of jeweled gold around her head A hooded falcon
perches on her forearm Behind in a chariot is the Commander of
the Seventh GENERAL NICOMEDIA SCAURIA CARNIFEXIA(the Butcher)
Carnifexia is a woman Clad in dark bronze armor and plumed
helmet with jet-black hair and blue eyes she is shapely yet
brutally strong As large as a man she is a totalitarian
enforcer famous for her lack of mercy and sexual enjoyment of
conquest and slaughter

The Legion itself marches to a slow cadence(like today’s French
Foreign Legion) Each man is over six feet tall and wears bear
skin cowls over their helmets The drums beat and the Legion
moves slowly from the shadowed streets into a space of light

The Zingarans watch from buildings and windows and street sides--
encouraged to cheer by burly Aquilonian giants walking among them
in chain mail

CLOSE DIERA--HER MOTHER--Watch her eyes are moist with
apprehension

AELDRA-OTHERS--Watch--the shadows of the standards pass over
them Aeldra looks up at the splendid figure of the Empress
their eyes meet The Empress’s gaze is icy cold and imperious
and turns Aeldra’s eyes

CUT TO

THRONE HALL--The throne is empty But the room is filled with
Aquilonians and Zingaran court officials Next to the empty
throne on either side are the ivory curile chairs of Imperial
authority Closest to us sits Theodesia--magnificently
sculptured and cruel Fortunas is standing Behind are Scauria
Carnifexia Felexio and Metallus

FORTUNAS
For valor and disdain for your own
safety Indeed loyal dedication to
what we live for--holding the Sacred
Line I am pleased Publius Kon

Now we see Kon bowing

FORTUNAS
--Take this small token of the
State’s gratitude

Scauria Carnifexia steps forward with a wreath made of bronze

CARNIFEXIA
The Crown of Bronze for defending
the State’s interests

THEODESTIA
A brave son--fighting at his father’s
side How do you feel Publius Kon

KON
I would have done the same for
any ally It is my duty my Empress

She smiles

KON
It just happened to be my father

This is unexpected--gives Kon an edge Theodesia is surprised
and smiles at him

THEODESIA
And how fares the King Publius

KON
The King is mending my Empress
I’m sure that pleases you

He bows to her holding his crown on He turns and leaves
Clivus stands

CLIVUS
Consul Gaius Metallus

Metallus walks forward passing Kon Metallus gives him a pleased
smile He walks up to the Emperor and Empress--salutes
Fortunas watches to see Kon gone then returns the salute

FORTUNAS
Alas the worthy Metallus a man of
the highest order We-we are but
the inheritors of civilization
Whereas men like yourself rise to
ride the Public Horse You are its
true protectors There is no honor
I can give you Metallus You have
too many already

He laughs

THEODESIA
We thought you should know that the
Zingaran Legion peacekeeping in
Kara Khitai have revolted

METALLUS
Revolted

THEODESTIA
Yes mutinied Killed their officers
and any other of ours they could find
By the time authorities reacted they
had marched off--disappeared into the
esert

METALLUS
Coming back here no doubt Part of the
plot Who leads them

Clivus leans in Felexio looms over his shoulder

CLIVUS
Skelas Michaes
METALLUS
The Protector of the Crown

FELEXIO
Exactly The King’s right arm

METALLUS
We’ve found a few who fled that night
They’ ve confessed but they want to
see the King

FORTUNAS
They must be crucified immediately

METALLUS
But we might learn more from them

THEODESIA
No the Emperor is right Let justice
be swift We know what is happening
Here

CARNIFEXIA
And we know what to do about it

He looks at the huge bronze-armored Carnifexia whose eyes show
the glint of satisfaction He looks back to Theodesia and
Fortunas

METALLUS
--And the Zingaran Legion my Emperor

FORTUNAS
Let them come home I will slaughter
them at the city gates The Empress
will enjoy the spectacle

She takes his hand in hers and leans against him

THEODESIA
That is all for now Consul

CUT TO

AQUIELONIAN CANTONMENT--By the gates a crowd of Zingarans watch
in horror as four crosses are erected with men crucified on them
Carnifexia rides below in her chariot giving instructions as the
are raised A fifth cross is still on the ground where
Legionaries nail the feet and hands of the thug Gothio who
threatened Conan in the inn not long ago He screams out in pai
with each hammer blow

The Aquilonians work quickly The Emperor in a scarlet and
golden robe watches from a special tent Theodesia is at his
side holding him and watching the executions Dust raises as a
chariot comes down the hill from the castle

CLOSE CHARIOT--Being driven by none other than Conan the King
He is wrapped in dark blue robes and wears his crown He pulls
up in front of the last cross confronting Scauria Carnifexia

CONAN
Who ordered this

Felexio is suddenly there behind him with a huge blond Nordheime
Legionary

CARNIFEXIA--An imposing figure in thick bronze and purple robes
looks him up and down

CARNIFEXIA
Justice Good Aquilonian--justice
Reward for virtue--punishment for
wrong You see King how quickly
Aquilonia punishes the transgressor
After all he tried to kill--you

Conan pulls the chariot close to the man he knew The eyes wide
in recognition His mouth opens as if to speak but he says
nothing

CARNI FEXIA
He seems to know you

Conan whirls around

CONAN
He should I am his King Is his
King but a dog that Aquilonia crucifies
his subjects at will Is the King too
weak to do his own justice

CARNIFEXIA

Aquilonia makes no account of her
actions to barbarian Kings

Conan faces her

CARNIFEXIA
He will die as the State wishes

Conan looks at the man’s face--now with eyes that are pleading to
him The man moves his lips Conan leans close

GOTHIO
Not--this way

CONAN
No--

He leans back looks at the menacing Amazon form of Carnifexia
then to Felexio then down Suddenly his robe is drawn aside and
with a flash of steel he buries a short sword up to the hilt in
Gothio’s side Blood runs over his hand the horses smell it and
lurch forward He pulls the sword out and Gothio lets out a long
Sigh and his head falls limp and dead Conan wheels around

CONAN
He dies as I wish--like a man

Carnifexia steps forward her hand on her gladius Conan leans
out and slaps her with a powerful back-hand using the flat of his
bloodied blade She recoils but doesn’t fall her sword drawn
Felexio draws too the soldiers ready spear and shield Conan
wheels his chariot around facing Carnifexia

CONAN
You want some of it bitch
(to Felexio)

What about you I’11 show you who
rules here

Suddenly a voice rings out

VOICE
He rules

They turn It is Metallus--walking towards them

METALLUS
After all it is his kingdom

He stands next to Conan’s chariot

METALLUS
We are just guests here

He looks up at Conan

METALLUS
Go back my friend I will mend
whatever needs mending here--

He stares down Felexio smiles at Carnifexia

CONAN
Which river do you drink from
Gaius Metallus

METALLUS
The one that quenches my thirst

Conan pulls his matched horses around and thunders off under the
five crosses

CUT TO

THEODESIA--Walking with Metallus she wears a white silken robe
part of which trails away in the twilight breeze

THEODESIA
I was especially pleased with your
handling of the King Consul

METALLUS
It is what you employ me for Empress

THEODESIA
--But--He did defy an Imperial Officer
One of my favorite Generals

METALLUS
Perhaps we should be tolerant

THEODESIA
Because Conan is your friend Consul

METALLUS
Perhaps he should be arrested and
put to death

Theodesia stops

METALLUS
But if you decide to do so remember
that Aquilonian law requires that
Royal blood cannot be spilled except
in battle

THEODESIA
Suffocation wrapped in felt and ridden
over by horses Drowning It is too
warm to freeze a man

METALLUS
My dear Empress you are too
imaginative I recommend poison

THEODESIA
Why of course how obvious

She looks him over differently

THEODESIA
I thought he was your friend Consul

METALLUS
I am only a servant of the State
my Empress It is not for me to
decide

CUT TO

Night--KON--Walking through the streets of Messantia head bare

with the tunic and cloak of an ordinary citizen He is careful

and wishes to see as few as possible He knocks at the door of

the Pictish Witch It is open He pushes it She is sitting by
the fire--Diera at her side laying seductively

WITCH
You could not stay away from her
could you

KON
No

Diera rushes to him throws her arms around him He kisses her
fiercely then looks at her mother His eyes are savage

WITCH
I’ll leave you alone

She gets up gracefully and is gone into a back room He looks
around not trusting something

DIERA
I worried You could have
been killed

He pulls her down by the fire and takes her with a passion that

is ancient racial beyond his control

KON--Laying by the fire with his breeches on but shirtless
sword lays at his side and his arm is around Diera
wine is nearby and a rabbit roasts on the flickering fire

TO

A jug of

His

Kon

has dozed off and a shadow passes over him First Diera’s eyes
open she sits up covering herself and awakens Kon who looks up

into the face of

CONAN--Looming over him the Witch at his side

KON
How did you find me

WITCH
I brought him

Conan kneels over him

CONAN
Quiet Listen to what I say

Kon starts to speak Conan puts his hand out

CONAN

They are going to kill me
“KON

Who
CONAN

You know who Your masters The
Emperor Civilization Aquilonia
They have to --I defy them--They
crush those who defy them

KON
But you are their--

CONAN
--Friend and ally You believed
that which they taught you about
the Sacred Line The chain that
is stronger than any man Bigger
Greater
KON
Yes

CONAN
Well the line is made of trust and
faith not steel And that is where
they lie They use our faith and
trust and we are fools in their eyes
They betray us and it is the worst
thing men do But they will pay

He grabs Kon’s hand and grips it in his fist

CONAN
Trust Crom and yourself I once
told you that

KON
I listened

He puts a crude crown in his hand

CONAN
This is the true Crown of Zingara
not that silly thing I wear It is
made of iron which we take from the
ground and hammer with our skill and
sweat and make something of This
is the true wealth of man It is
yours if you earn it

Kon pulls himself up looks at the crown--it is crude ancien
from the bowels of the earth

CONAN
You must take the giri and her
mother I’ve left jewels

He grabs a sack full of something

CONAN
You must leave this place-You
cannot do anything for me Go
amongst the Picts and they will
know what to do

Kon grabs his other hand

KON
I’1l not leave you father
as

CONAN
Men are not great They are
not gods just men and they fool
themselves They are greedy
lustful and blind--but they know
what is right and what is wrong
I was wrong and I can never make
that up to you

Kon takes the crown of iron

CONAN
There are no great races or peoples
Only the strong and the weak the
false or the true Being a fool--
You can be so much more than I

He gets up goes to the door

CONAN
It’s up to you now

He is gone before Kon can follow but he jumps up anyway Diera
looks at him the Witch looks to him He holds the crown in his
hand

KON (to Witch)
Who was my mother

WITCH
Some say it was the Daughter of
the Snows

KON
Take me to the Picts

CUT TO

WATER--Pouring over marble--cascading down upon Conan who sits
under an artificial waterfall in his baths Fire pots give off a
red hue as they warm the water A faint steam drifts overhead
Conan is attended to by his concubines who rub his shoulders and
dress his wounds with scented oils Conan looks off down an
arcade where gossamer curtains blow in a faint breeze

He sees a shadow-it grows into a distant sensuous figure of a
graceful woman Conan snaps his fingers His concubines look to
him He dismisses them with a wave They scurry off

Now the figure glides toward him indeed all silk and the light
reflecting off a smooth oiled thigh or shoulder The woman is
followed by a servant who bears a tray She moves with a slow
walk--stopping tentatively behind the thin curtains Conan
stands and wraps himself in golden cloth

ZULIEKA
I have not seen you since they
tried to take your life

CONAN
It’s been too long

ZULIEKA
Are you well my lord

CONAN
Enough

She enters and lays down on an elevated cushion She indicates
the tray be placed before her

ZULIEKA
Roast porks and veals to give you
sustenance And wine to forget
your pain

CONAN
We barbarians don’t feel pain
But we enjoy wine

She pours two goblets--the slave leaves She passes him some
meat on a skewer He takes it and eats it beastly lets the
grease drip down his chin

ZULIEKA
How does it taste

He grabs her by her hair twists her head to him and kisses her
roughly She tries to pull away but he kisses her deeply She
gasps then bites at his neck and pulls away smiling wantonly

ZULIEKA
You haven’t tried the wine

He looks in her eyes then to the goblet puts it to his lips and
drinks it down fully Then he runs his tongue over his lips
CONAN
Wine of Shiraz Full with hints
of cobra venom and a faint taste of
almonds Black nightshade Smooth
with a long finish

She suddenly has fear in her eyes

CONAN
Why there is just enough for you

He grabs her goblet in one vice-like grip and in a lightening
stroke grabs her other hand wrenching her to him

The two almost naked figures panting and struggling through the
drifting mist and gossamer curtains--they arch and roll back into
the shadows She’s gasping almost crying out--a gurgling sound
her choking cough--more gurgling--the goblet clinks and rolls
across the polished marble trickling wine Now only their
breathing then she lets out a horrific scream Her legs shining
in the light thrash about

cuT TO

WIZARD--Running down the hallway

WIZARD
Help me Help me Murder
The King has been murdered

People come out of doors--guards lackeys Aquilonian courtiers
Felexio is suddenly there in tunic but holding a sword

WIZARD
Murder The King is dying
He’s been poisoned

Suddenly Metallus is there with Clivus

METALLUS
Where

He grabs the Wizard

WIZARD
In his bath--the Lady Zulieka--
She is poisoned too

Metallus and the others rush past the Wizard He turns and sees
in the hallway Carnifexia without armor the Emperor and
Empress They whisper to each other

CUT TO

BATHS--Zulieka twists in a few final convulsions on the marble
and slides headfirst into the water Conan is face down and
unmoving on the floor His one hand clutching at a cloth of gold
curtains his other gripping the wine goblet Wine is pooled
around his head He lays perfectly still while a few bubbles
emerge from the water Metallus rushes in--goes to Conan
Felexio and Clivus stand over

METALLUS
He’s dead--poisoned

FELEXIO
She appears to have shared his
fate--pity

Metallus looks up at him

FELEXIO
Such a beautiful woman

Metallus stands as Fortunas and Theodesia enter--behind them
Carnifexia with several of her most strapping soldiers
Metallus turns to them

METALLUS
The King is dead

FORTUNAS
Then I claim sovereignty in the
name of the Senate and People of
Aquilonia

THEODESIA
What of his son

FORTUNAS (To Felexio)
Find him--there must be no
complication

Carnifexia strides forward
CARNIFEXIA
Obviously a palace plot--his
concubines servants--they are
all in on it

Metallus looks to Theodesia

Ras THEODESIA
We must find his son

CARNIFEXIA
Put them all to death scourge
the disease before it spreads

At that moment the Wizard rushes in and is seized

WIZARD
I had nothing to do with it
I was asleep

FORTUNAS
I’m afraid we must nullify in
order to achieve balance and
stability

Metallus leans down next to Conan as the Wizard is dragged away
METALLUS
Cover him’and take him to my

quarter He was my friend

FORTUNAS
Yes he was

CUT TO
WOMEN--Scream as the Aquilonian guards bring in Conan’s
concubines binding them and sewing them up in felt shrouds as
they scream and writhe
CLOSE WIZARD--Twisting as they sew the shroud over his face--—
CLOSE METALLUS--Calm detached he looks at Conan who is half
turned over He reaches down looks at his face--he seems quite

dead The Wizard screams

METALLUS
Take care of him damm you

The men go to assist with the Wizard and Metallus thrusts a
dagger inside the shroud and rolls Conan over on it

METALLUS
Now finish this

a CUT TO

THE BLACK RIVER--Kon Diera and her mother are rowed across the
moonlit water toward the dark impenetrable forest on the other
side They pass going downstream by the royal docks Torches
are seen coming down the pier The party ducks down and slips by
in the current and disappears into the darkness of the river

CUT TO

DOCK--Aquilonian Legionaries carry the bundled forms of the felt
shrouds over their shoulders they twist and struggle--the
screams of the women muted by the thick fabric A Priest of
Mitra gives invocations followed by others bearing torches and
swinging smoking pots At the end of the pier stands Carnifexia
shapely in her gathered robe her long black hair blowing in the
wind

CARNIFEXIA
First the women

One is propped on her feet--Carnifexia pushes her over screaming
to plunge into the dark water One after another are quickly
presented and dispatched this way their screams gone with a
splash a bit of struggle Carnifexia is caught up in the sheer
sadistic rush of it all--finally the Wizard kicking and
thrashing

CARNIFEXIA
Throw him

Two burly Seventh Legion killers in Wolf’s Heads throw him far
into the river

METALLUS
Now the King

He grabs his ankles Felexio the top and they swing his dead
form

METALLUS
Goodbye comrade

He is thrown far out and splashes into the moonlight and is gone
Metallus turns and walks away Felexio follows Fortunas and
Theodesia watch from shore Only Carnifexia seems to stare out
at the blackness of the other side

CUT TO

UNDERWATER--FELT--A dagger ripping through--huge hands pull the
shroud away--Conan bursts forth swims after the sinking shroud
nearby--grabs it rips it with his dagger--pulls the Wizard out
by his collar He swims up dragging the Wizard still half
shrouded

CLOSE CARNIFEXIA--She turns back to the others who proceed back
to the castle

RIVER-Conan and the Wizard break the surface--Conan holds the
Wizard’s head up Both gasp they’ve drifted away from the pier
but Carnifexia stops--looks back Conan goes under with the
Wizard She watches a second seems satisfied then goes on
Conan and the Wizard come up much farther down river

CLOSE CONAN--WIZARD--Breathing hard

CONAN
Can you swim

WIZARD
Not well

CONAN
Then youll drown

WIZARD
The others--the poor women

CONAN
They never hurt anyone She’ll
pay I swear to Crom she’ll pay

He grabs the Wizard by the collar and starts for the other side
CUT TO

THE FOREST--DARK--Shadows that glide like spirits Kon makes his
way through the waist-high ferns dimly lit by light of a filtered
moon A huge flapping thing breaks into flight from a tree
overhead Diera gasps in fright and clutches her mother They
look to Kon and his glinting short sword

WITCH
Do you believe in magic

KON
My father once told me when I
was a boy that all things of this
earth can be cut with steel
WITCH
He is wrong all things that are
warm and have the blood of life--
But there are things that are cold--

She is interrupted by movement ahead--men Dark and crouched
they stand out of the ferns The Witch steps forward and speaks
in a strange Gaelic tongue that is not like speech at all but
more like song It has definite rhythms and meter to the sounds
She is answered by one of the dark men They move ahead she
follows with Kon and Diera

CLEARING--They emerge Two chariots are brought up their
drivers fierce in the moonlight with red hair tied over their
heads They are bare-chested and covered in blue tatoos that
even show in the moonlight They wear trousers of a Tartan plai
wool and carry long ornate swords at their waists Kon is wary

WITCH
Get in

He does--the Pict looks him over contemptuously but Kon is
probably equally as scary to him Diera gets in with him holds
him The Witch climbs in the other chariot and the driver
lashes the horses and they hustle through the forest the
dappling moonlight flickering over Kon and Diera

FENS--Wide gleaming marshes--the two chariots run across the
horizon to

HILLS--Low covered in heather and stones--the moon low in the
night sky now as they make their way

CUT TO

CONAN--WIZARD--Warming themselves over a small fire of coals by
the side of the river It is early dawn Neither have much
clothing and shiver in the early chill

CONAN
Yesterday I was a King

WIZARD
And today

CONAN
Cold and hungry Life is never
disappointing
CONAN
Crom I’m still here and I
enjoy your joke

They hear horses Conan douses the fire and the two throw
themselves into an irrigation ditch and half submerge Along a
nearby road a patrol of Aquilonian Cavalry thunder past bearing
the Upraised Hand Standard of the Seventh Legion

CUT TO
CONAN--WIZARD--Staring at an old plow horse and mule corralled
behind a farmer’s hut It is still dawn
VOICE

You want a horse

They turn and see a sturdy gray-bearded FARMER--two large Young
Men have gotten between them and the road The old Farmer has a
spear The boys have a mallet and a scythe Conan looks them up
and down

CONAN
Yes

FARMER
How you gonna pay for it You
don’t even have any shoes--Your
Majesty

Conan stiffens

CONAN
You know who I am

FARMER
They say you are dead

CONAN
Do I look it

FARMER
Close--and older than I remember
Crassides--Primus Pilus--Third Cohort

He comes to attention the spear straight up
CRASSIDES
These are my sons--Attention boys
--The King

They do likewise smiling

CRASS IDES
You don’t remember me Sire Of
course I wasn’t talking to Generals
or Kings in those days and when
you retired us and gave us this
land I was just another soldier

CONAN
Tell me Crassides was I a good King

CRASSIDES
Far as I know Sir You made us
rich and fat And you were just
A just King that’s always the best
King Damn those bastards for killing
you Sire They say your son is still
around though They’re looking for
him

CONAN
To kill him so they can claim
Imperium over Zingara How do
you feel about that Crassides

CRASSIDES
Legionary Crassides Sire I feel
I would rather die a free man at
your side

CONAN
Do you think others would feel
this way Follow a dead King

CRASSIDES
My boys--Right boys

They nod Conan looks them over--an army To fight al
Civilization with Yesterday he was King He looks up

CONAN
Crom

CUT T

A STONEHENGE-LIKE TEMPLE--Bare monoliths on a stark rock strewn
ridge in the Pictish highlands It is a dark afternoon and a
storm has blown through The skies are angry gray and black
Kon wrapped in his cloak stares out at the bleak landscape
Diera and the Witch take shelter below in the lee of the great
stones He turns leans down to her

KON
Is my mother still alive

WITCH
No

She pauses--looking away

WITCH

--And yet--she is with us
KON

Tell me
WITCH

She was taken by the Ice Worm
They gave her to the Ice Worm
Some say she lives in it still
like all its victims

KON
Who Who did this

WITCH
Priests--Shamans--long ago--Perhaps
because she slept with your father
Because she bore you

KON
How do you know

WITCH
It was cold for four years--as
if the ice were coming back We
remembered the ice in our dreams

She grabs him

WITCH
The ice is gone--the old race is
gone Even the Worms of the Earth--
gone Only the One remains and so
we gave her to him

KON
You

WITCH
Yes I was a Priestess of the Moon
All men wanted me but--

She strokes Diera’s head Diera’s eyes blaze

WITCH (distant)
The Snow Giant’s daughter was more
than I She was the most beautiful--
she had the power to blind men with
desire An so my voice was against
her and we took her to the Ice Worm’s
lair And I thought she was gone

Tears roll down her face

WITCH
I knew you would come back--Your
father would be a King --My

Gaughter--all this I saw--I knew
and it came to be I am--dammed
The gods will not take me and
give me peace

Kon leans back against the stone the wind blows cold across his
face His soul is chilled

KON
--Then we are both damned--The
Ice Worm

WITCH

--She--the Snow Giant’s Daughter

said that the spirit of the thing
entered your father and that you

are its son

KON
You take me to its lair and we shall
see who’s son I am

CUT TO

NIGHT--Trackless fens and ridges of white rock damp and cold
with the wind A huge moon rising throws its light on Kon’s
face He strains to move a huge slab of rock carved with
ancient runes

WITCH
What will you do You cannot
kill it with steel--it is cold--
colder than the great ice

He reveals steps crudely cut ages before going into a dark
primeval darkness He slips down tucking his gladius in front
He barely squeezes in

KON
The helmet-—bag

She hands them to him he wedges down into the darkness
CUT TO

A SPARK--Again then Kon’s face is illuminated by the cloth and
powder he has sprinkled as the fire lights

WOOD--Small pieces added--Kon looks over his shoulder The cave
is rounded with ridges like the inside of some beast Ice on
the floor gleams Kon puts more wood on the fire--it glows He
takes out a water skin that he uses like a bellows to blow on the
blaze Then he adds pieces of black anthracite--the coal of the
fens and marshes

CUT TO
COALS--Red hot glowing--Kon’s sword stuck in them

CLOSE KON--He looks at the floor--strange shapes carved into it
by something Piles of bones--cracked and mashed in the corners
The bones are ground and munched but parts of skulls and ribs
identify them as human Kon stirs the coals with his red hot
blade

CUT TO

THE BLACK AND RED WOLF HEAD STANDARD OF THE ZINGARAN
LEGION--Marching in the dust along the river bank--they extend
back into a cloud of dust--ten thousand men They walk like men
not like the drilled machine of the Aquilonians But in this is
their strength for they are coming home to their wives sons and
daughters in peril At the vanguard is Michaes in armor He
sees dust ahead

MICHAES
Dust a chariot approaching
Archers front
od

Archers fan out ready for what comes

DUST--Out of which trots a mule with Conan astride it a cape
blowing from his shoulders Behind him trots the plowhorse
pulling a crude wagon with the Wizard and Crassides His sons
run alongside carrying scythes

MICHAES--Grins widely He cannot believe it

MICHAES
The King

Conan pulls up his mule--he wears a ridiculous wide hat of straw

MICHAES
Hail Sire I am glad you live
Where is your crown

CONAN
I left it in Zingara

He looks at the men who rush around Many of these he trained
and all know him from their fathers and uncles The words
“Conan--King Conan--the King lives” are passed in whispers

CONAN
Will you hear me I want all
of you to know what I say My
crown is in Messantia They took
it from me--Strangers that do not
live there I trusted them and
I was wrong I trusted and I
grew soft and rich as well as
foolish and weak I forgot what
it is to be a man I became a
King--Pheir King and so in time
they took my crown

He looks around at all the faces

CONAN
But you still trust me To you
I am still your King and the Crown
it is not mine to lose It is yours
I have failed you Comrades and so
I must go and get it back

Silence

MICHAES
Did you hear--the King your King
is going back to get his crown Are
there a few amongst you who would
help him I will

Voices--hands raised “I--Yes--I will go”
MICHAES
A few--Who loves their country
and their King
More men raise their hands
MICHAES
A few who would march against
those who call themselves our

masters

More shouting--now the whole Legion is astir

CENTURION
That Crown of Jewels was not
our Crown

AQUILIFER

Our Crown is Iron

CONAN
Will you make me one Will you
make me a Crown of Iron

CENTURION
Yes--That is what a King must
wear Iron

Screaming--raising of shields clanking swords against them--
screaming “Yes Yes Crown of Iron” Ten thousand men as
one “Yes we will go with you to Zingara Yes we will be at
your side”

BELLOWS--FIRE--ARMORERS-Pounding out a round ring of laurels--a
Crown of Iron

CUT TO

COALS-Red hot in the darkness Kon’s eyes flash at the sound of
something deep in the darkness A shrill keening almost
mournful emanates He stands up pulls his cloak around him as
it has suddenly gotten cold Frost forms on the ribbed stone

surfaces The barest light comes from the coals but a dim
flickering appears far in the darkness Then he sees

TWO GREENISH EYES--Radiating ahead swaying from side to side but
getting closer The wall of the almost organic tunnel reflect
briefly in the cold light

KON--Up and walking towards it--frost forming on the walls--ice
on the floor of stone

THE FIRE--Goes ovt--the coals gone--only a blue cold dimness
gives shape

CUT TO

WITCH--Throwing runes into the dirt wailing in some ancient
tongue crying and rending her hair--out of her mind Diera
shrinks from her

CUT TO

THE TUNNEL--Out of which emerges the Ice Worm--white slippery as
a frozen lake--coiling and thrusting not like a snake but a
giant worm Its head is smaller than its body--round and white
with the two glowing eyes It opens its mouth-rows and rows of
small sharp teeth Glistening on its head between the eyes is
a spear-like horn of gleaming diamond ice The keening--crying
sound is almost like the Witch above As the Worm comes forward
everything is frozen hard and glasslike around it Now the whole
pale body glows and lights the translucent walls of the cave as
if this is all in some immense dark glacier coming from the
bowels of the earth

KON--Cloaked in his robes--his mouth covered walks towards it--
stops--the creature slides at him its head lifting

KON
Crom Damn you

The thing seems enraged at the god’s name--opens its blue mouth-
blows out a frosty stench that freezes on Kon’s face

CLOSE KON--He casts back his robes to reveal his helmet held by
its straps--glowing--filled with coals He pulls his reddened
sword from it and back-handedly flings the helmet and its fiery
contents into the yawning mouth of the Worm Coals and glowing
metal are quickly gone A shrieking occurs the old Worm shakes
and convulses pulls in on itself The noise takes on an
unearthly almost human intensity The white skin convulses
violently--suddenly the mouth opens and water-like liquid spews

out flooding the floor Kon leaps on the thing behind the head
and plunges his red hot sword into it Water and red burst
forth It bleeds He plunges again--this time behind the eyes
then he pulls the blade free and throws himself back

KON--On the cave floor watches as the Ice Worm writhes and
twists screeching in its death agony It’s bloated belly turns
out toward him He stands and hacks it open--ripping down its
length Bones and water and red fluid thinner than blood gush
forth And something else--bright red and catching the dim light
in a sparkle A huge red stone--The Eye of the Serpent--Kon
scrambles for it

CLOSE--His hand reaches it--

KON--Suddenly he is imbued with a power and determination that is
elemental He kicks the flopping head away--pulls himself up and
with his sword he swings at the horn of ice Clang--he glares in
primordial hatred--winds back--swings two handed for all he’s
worth Clenge The horn flies end over end into darkness

CUT TO

KON--Emerging from the ground thrusting up like surfacing from
deep water through the narrow passage way He finds the sky dark
with a violent storm Wind--rain whips across his face He
looks to Diera who is holding her mother’s limp form--the
Witch’s rain soaked hair hanging down her face ashen and
lifeless Diera’s face is streaming with tears and rain She
howls incantations into the wind Kon is wrapped in his cloak
and soaked his hair blows and his eyes are dark pools of
unspoken emotion and now a strange wisdom a maturity He climbs
out carrying the horn Diera sees it and starts screaming lets
her mother go--she cowers away He puts the horn in his belt and
gently picks up the Witch’s lifeless body--puts his forehead to
her cheek and holds her Then he stands and reaches for-Diera
comes to him He takes her hand

CcuT TO

TEMPLE OF MITRA--Throbs to an ancient cadence of drums the low
chant of thousands of voices Fortunas Emperor of the Civilized
World--ruler of an empire from Zingara to the Vilyet Sea bows
with the exquisite Empress Theodesia before the Pontifex Maximus
who bestows the blessing of Mitra upon them Behind are the
Consuls Legates Tribunes and the black mass of the Legions

The storm rages dark and furious here too
SOLDIERS OF THE FRONTIER LEGION--Clad in golden armor lead a
white bull up the granite steps to an altar of purest marble
where a Headsman with an axe waits

CLOSE THEODESIA--Arching her back and beckoning to the gods of
thunder lighting darkness and power The rain runs down her
face and arms and breast

THE AXE MAN--Huge and dark lifts his ceremonial weapon

CLOSE THEODESIA--In some realm of passion as lighting illuminate
her face and gleaming eyes--the thunder claps

MARBLE STEPS--Blood running down them
PONIFEX--LEGION--CROWDS--Bowing and chanting a foreboding chant
CUT TO

THE FENS OF PICTLAND--Fires burning in another circle of crude
monoliths A strawman about ten feet high adorned with heather
and garlands of flowers buffets in the wind The storm has
broken Below sits the Pictish King Orlock Mac Morn on a thron
of stone slabs He is surrounded by his retinue of blue painted
and tattooed war-men Pictish girls dance in a circle around th
straw-man as it is set afire As the flames and smoke leap up
we see the Witch’s body surrounded by Druids who bear her to a
grave on the lonely moor Kon and Diera watch as women come
forth with garlands of flowers and drape them over the dead
Priestess

CUT TO
ORLOCK MAC MORN--Looking sternly down from his seat

MAC MORN
Why would I help you How do
I know you are what you say

Kon produces the simple round crown of iron that Conan gave him

MAC MORN
Anyone could make that

KON
The Priestess--You yourself know
she was once great and--

MAC MORN
She is dead

He stands up

KON
What of this

He pulls from his belt the crystal horn of the Ice Worm Mac

Morn recoils as do the Druids--the women scream out prayers and
incantations

KON
My father said I must break his
sword If the spirit of the Ice
Worm was with me then I am free
now And you--you are free of the
ancient curse but while you hesitate
our enemies grow stronger

CUT TO

MAP--In a splendid tent in the Aquilonian cantonment Officers
and scribes wait for orders Fortunas sits on an ivory campaign
chair magnificently armored The Legate commanding the Frontier
Legion and Carnifexia wait along with Metallus Felexio strides
in wearing dusty armor and cape

FELEXIO
They are here--

He points to a position north on the edge of Zingara

FELEXIO
They are on our side of the
Black River

METALLUS
Their strength

FELEXIO
One Legion-the Wolf’s Head and
what rabble travel with them

He hesitates

FORTUNAS
Go on

FELEXIO
There’s rumors that Conan is alive
That he leads them
FORTUNAS
He can’t be I saw him dead

He quickly controls himself

He points to
Messantia

FORTUNAS (calm confident)
What does it matter if he is He is
no more than a commander of barbarian
auxiliaries

METALLUS
They sometimes take potions these
barbarian Kings to ward off harm
I’m not superstitious but I’ve seen
strange things Maybe he is alive

CARNIFEXIA
Then I will crush them and bring
you his head

METALLUS
No one can withstand the Seventh
Legion but let us make an example
of them

FORTUNAS
What do you mean

a tributary of the Black River--a valley leading toa

METALLUS
They will come up this gorge--try
and storm the gates by surprise at
night

FORTUNAS
Why wouldn’t they march up the road

METALLUS
Because I trained Conan to strike
fast and with surprise This is
consolidation of force--his only
chance

FORTUNAS
You seem to believe these rumors--
of his being alive

METALLUS
One must discount nothing

FORTUNAS
Then what would you do Consul

METALLUS
Let him come this way--only the gates
will be held by a Cohort He will
stop there and when the sun comes up
the entire city can watch an Aquilonian
Legion--

CARNIFEXIA
The Seventh

FORTUNAS
--Crush the barbarian revolt

He walks to the map

FORTUNAS
The Seventh will be hidden beyond
the northern road We can block
him that way and swing around to
take him in the flank after he
emerges from this ravine of yours
Metallus

FELEXIO
The Cohort guarding the gates will
be important-—-

METALLUS
Ill take that--

FORTUNAS
No--you’1) be with me Consul
I’11 need your--sage advise You
take the Cohort Felexio

FELEXIO
Thank you my Emperor

FORTUNAS
--And you my goddess of strife--You
will lend me your splendid command

Carnifexia is angry at being cut out of all the glory but she
keeps her thoughts to herself

CARNIFEXIA
An honor my Emperor

CUT TO

MARSHES--FOG--East of the Zingaran Road The distant Rabirian
Hills loom as a shadow The rebel army vanguard pushes through
the wetlands A SCOUT sees higher ground ahead and as it
becomes distinct it is seen that lines of figures in loose
groups appear

SCOUT
Figures--Somebody’s ahead

CENTURION
Infantry to the front in phalanx

Men rush forward and form a line

CENTURION
Cavalry and archers forward on
the flank

The horses have trouble negotiating the swamp The Centurion can
now see that it is a crowd of civilians just people waving--they
spread out and it can be seen that they are townsfolk farmers
refugees from the harsh Aquilonian oppression Wagons and carts
follow Men and women rush amongst the troops shaking hands
kissing them Horses are startled The Centurions bark out
orders keeping the troops in formation Here and there a
trooper sees a wife or mother a son or daughter and starts for
them

CENTURION
Hold your Line

Conan and Michaes ride through the openings in a chariot driven
by Crassides now wearing armor and a helmet

CRASSIDES
See Sire--I told you

Suddenly Conan sees something

CONAN
Over there--to the left

He sees a tall blonde-woman stately and graceful in her cape

CRASSIDES
You have an eye for them Sire
He rides over The woman Aeldra turns to them she doesn’t
rush--she stands tall and majestic as they thunder up and stop
Conan looks down at her She looks into his eyes glistening
with tears She wears a dagger at her trim waist

CONAN
How did you know

AELDRA
I heard rumors

He reaches for her pulls her up into the chariot they embrace
Tears roll down his face She pulls part of her robe up and
wipes his eyes

AELDRA
It’s not right for a King

CONAN (soft
She said you would come from the
depths of hell to fight at my side

AELDRA
Then I have

He kisses her there and then and the people cheer because it is
good to see their King kissing a common woman one of their own

CUT TO

DUSK--METALLUS--FORTUNAS--Watching from the battlements as the
Seventh marches out below

FORTUNAS
The city seems empty Consul

METALLUS
They are afraid my Emperor

FORTUNAS

What have they to fear We are
civilized men We bring order to
chaos We allow the trader the
the merchant to grow to flourish
It is only behind the shield and
sword that art can bloom--poetry--
literature All are paid for by
our arms Do they fear wealth and
power
METALLUS
Those are things to fear my Lord

FORTUNAS
They are deities Do you believe
in the gods Consul

METALLUS
When it’s appropriate Sire

FORTUNAS
I don’t The gods are merely
entertainment The real god and
there is only one--is power The

power of thunder water wind fire

The power of men who are not afraid
fo use it --What formation do we
break these savages with tomorrow
Consul

METALLUS
The Line with encircling horns

FORTUNAS
The School solution

METALLUS
It has served me well Sire

FORTUNAS
True it bought you the Crown of
Reeds and the Public Horse but
this must be a rout Total war
without’ quarter Annihilation

CUT TO

NIGHT--THE ZINGARAN ROAD--Lying open under the moon It fades

into the distance
looking down it

straight of well cut stones--Conan stands
To his left begins the ravine-shallow here but

stretching to steep tree covered cliffs on either side Behind
Conan are Michaes Crassides the Wizard-a few chariots

Suddenly several RIDERS gallop up from the rear

RIDER
Sire--The River

Conan turns to his right where flows the Black River in the

moonlight

Something is there

RIDER
Picts Sire Thousands of them

Conan can see great barges and canoes crossing towards him No
fires--no sound

CENTURION
Shall I call to defensive formation
CONAN
No
CRASSIDES
But they are Picts Sire
CONAN
Stand where you are Weapons

at rest

CUT TO

ORLOCK MAC MORN--And others leaping from long canoes weapons
gleaming--dressed for war With him are Kon and Diera The
Pictish King’s men form around him Mac Morn sees above on the
bluff

CONAN--Robe flowing in the wind A silvery crown of iron on his
head an axe and shield over his shoulder Behind him the
vanguard of his army stand at ease A horse neighs before an
empty chariot All glow in silver light

MAC MORN--Walks to him--Kon at his side

MAC MORN
How many are they

CONAN
They have three Legions--The Frontier
Emperor’s Standard and--the Seventh

MAC MORN
The Seventh--the Black Seventh

CONAN
Thirty thousand men all together

MAC MORN
That’s enough for me

He looks over at Kon

MAC MORN
I brought your son along Thought
you might need him

Conan looks into Kon’s eyes Kon looks right back at him They
love each other but things will never be easy between them

CONAN
I do

MICHAES
How can we beat them They are
Aquilonians--three to one against
us They are the finest soldiers
the worid has ever seen

CONAN
We don’t have to beat them We
just have to beat one man the
Emperor What is his weakness son

KON
Glory

CUT TO

NIGHT--GATES OF MESSANTIA--Riders hurtle towards them Infantry
run in formation behind On the gates stand Felexio and other
Legates The wall is thoroughly manned with archers and anti-
siege devices

RIDER
They come They are here

FELEXIO
Three Cohorts to the front

Six hundred men in three thick phalanxes run and form the Line in
front of the gates They hear a throbbing drumming sound--a
cadence

FELEXIO
Close the gates

CLOSE LEGIONARIES--They know what this means They are
expendable The gates are closed Fire pots filled with naphtha
and ballistas are loaded on the city wall
wo

CLOSE THEODESIA--In golden sensuous curved armor and crimson
robe She stands on the battlements hearing the drumming sound
increase She moves to Felexio’s side

THEODESIA
What is it

FELEXIO
Why their footsteps Empress-—-
(turns)
--Fire pots

Ballistas fire hurling pots of naphtha far into the night They
hit and explode in vicious spattering flame and light a mass of
Zingaran infantry The Zingarans let out a roar and charge the
Frontier Cohorts

THE LINES--Clash together below as the Empress watches Vicious
fighting occurs in the front ranks Fireworks--pots flaming
hoops etc are hurled at the attackers after falling on the
hapless Frontier Legionaries Men whirl about encased in burning
armor screaming Huge rocks are thrown next taking out sections
in the ranks

CLOSE THEODESIA--Totally absorbed in the fighting

CUT TO
CONAN--Standing in the darkness with Michaes Crassides and Kon--
watching part of his men in the futile attack The rest of his

Zingarans are in formation hidden by darkness gleaming in the
moonlight

CONAN
Now they have us exactly where
they want
He turns to Kon
CONAN

Now it’s time for you to go No
Matter what happens to us you must
not depart from the plan--Understand

KON
Understood

They look at each other wanting to say something more but
neither one can show his emotion easily Kon goes Conan turns
to Michaes

CONAN
Allow the vanguard to withdraw
and reassemble

FIGHTING-Trumpets and drums sound a recall The Zingarans cover
themselves with their shields and retreat into the darkness The
Aquilonians advance several paces after them

CLOSE--FELEXIO--He sees this

FELEXIO
Hold--Reform and remain in formation

The orders are shouted down
CUT TO

FORTUNAS--CARNIFEXIA--In war chariots He gives her a nod she
holds up her hand It is followed by the Iron Hand Standard of
the Seventh The entire Legion moves forward at the trot--armor
black chinking and clanking as the first light spills over them
from the east

RABIRIAN MOUNTAINS--Darkly silhouetted by a dramatic coming of
dawn

ZINGARAN LEGION--Reformed in the width of the defile where the
ravine comes out Behind them the steeply sided slopes and the
covered heights

CONAN--Raises his hand--the Wolf’s Head Standard comes up He
looks down the Line--it is straight-precise Michaes is at his
post at the far end He looks out at the distant city walls-—-
smoking where the engagement was On a hill on his right he
hears a beating thunder Suddenly the entire crest comes alive
with evenly spaced black figures running They spill over and
out forming into units

CONAN
Zingarans Prepare to engage the
Seventh Legion--Rapacio--the Butchers

As one they pound their shields with their spathas and shout

CONAN (to himself)
Crom Again we are here One thing
I know--You are watching you old wolf
The odds are long again you enjoy that
If I die--We will meet in Valhalla I
will eat at your table And if I live
you will find other ways to torture me
He salutes the sky

CONAN
I hope you enjoy it

He turns to the foe which are formed into square Cohorts of
black shields Cavalry and lighter troops spill out to the
sides Behind are the black chariots of the commanders as the
war drums continue--ten thousand darkly armored men moving in
perfect synchronization

CLOSE SEVENTH LEGION--Their black painted shields with a gray
mask of a demon Their faces are covered with cupid masks--
polished like obsidian They advance as the war drums pound out
a cadence

CLOSE CONAN--Raises his axe Drums sound the Zingaran advance--
pila up

CONAN
Steady the Line--Close your intervals

They draw closer

CONAN
Spike it

The pila come down--the two shield walls rush together and crash
Horrendous but disciplined moving--spearing thrusting--killing
A Zingaran shrieks and grabs his leg--another turns blood
pulsing from his neck over his comrades The shields close ranks
where they have fallen An Aquilonian is stabbed in the face--
his mask falls--he gags--others just drop like stones Swords
whistle like scythes Lances rip through shields impaling
sometimes two men

CONAN--Watching the Line--Aquilonian Cavalry plunges in from the
side Conan meets them with Crassides and cleaves a man from his
horse--he wades in whirling the axe like he practiced so long
ago Armor is smashed pieces fly Conan for a second is raised
against the dawn sky hacking and cleaving with mighty strokes--
arms and hands fly Then the attackers are gone or dead He
turns back-sees

THE SECOND WAVE OF AQUILONIANS--Spilling down the hill and
rushing to breaches in the fighting in spiked wedge formations
Over all this Conan can see Fortunas in his golden armor the
perfect conqueror on his chariot riding back and forth yelling
orders and hurling javelins
CARNIFEXIA--Behind the first Line spearing a Zingaran officer
through the throat She sees Michaes on his horse--turns her
chariot and thunders towards him Michaes sees her coming-
braces a lance--she cleaves it aside--swings out and hacks him in
the arm with her sword He drops the lance as she goes by and
wheels around

MICHAES--His right arm crushed he sheds his shield and pulls his
sword with his left Two loyal soldiers rush to guard him with
their shields She thunders down on them knocking one aside and
cleaving the other through the head She shakes him from her
blade and strikes at Michaes Their steel clangs and sparks

But her hand is stronger She beats him down to his knees and
then buries the blade through his shoulder down to his chest

His eyes go blank--he stands She rips out the sword in a spray
of blood and he falls lifeless under her wheels

CUT TO

THE BLACK RIVER--Here the Zingaran civilians have built a
barricade of hay bails and are inserting wooden spikes pointing
out ten feet Aeldra like the other women have armed
themselves with spears knives and short spikes Men have wood
axes and scythes--anything They hear the roar of battle from
the ravine Aeldra feels at her neck She wears the great
jewel--The Eye of the Serpent

WIZARD
What co you feel

She clutches it
AELDRA
Danger fear love and--hate
Why Why did he give this to me

CUT TO

CONAN--Seeing the Seventh is prevailing His own Line

faltering--death and dismemberment everywhere

CONAN
Fall back Reform Fall back
to the gorge

Trumpets blare recall The Zingarans as one turn their shields
and run The second Line lets them pass--spiking their pila and
briefly holding the Aquilonian onslaught

CLOSE METALLUS--In his chariot his sword in the air

ed METALLUS
Hold the formation

They start to go

METALLUS
Hold Do not break

Fortunas spurs up to them

FORTUNAS
Look at their backs We’ve beaten
them you old fool Now is the chance
to destroy them all

METALLUS
No--Not yet

ZINGARAN LINE--Running Conan races back plants the Standard at
the narrow gorge

CONAN
Reform on me

The Line forms--the Aquilonians come at a quick pace but are
still disciplined Conan sees they cannot go around him now He
looks up the steep slopes to the dark woods Crassides is by his
side--bloodied--his sons protecting him

CRASSIDES
We cannot hold

CONAN
I know

The shock of the Aquilonian Line hitting is like an earthquake
Men scream and go down in the front ranks Little groups form
into circles and die where they stand--fighting

CUT TO
PALACE WALLS--Theodesia can see it all Felexio is at her side
THEODESIA
He is advancing into the gorge
The Line is--
FELEXIO

Yes the Line is breaking to
pursue them

CUT TO

METALLUS--Even on his chariot with Fortunas He sees the
Zingarans start to break and run He hears a wailing battle cry
and Carnifexia thunders past swinging a mace-running down
stragglers

CARNI FEXIA
Come brothers--To the death

She is lost in orgiastic slaughter-slamming-rending--riding
across the lines leaning out of her chariot harvesting life

CLOSE CONAN--Hacks through a shield killing the man--he wheels
and cleaves another through his helmet

CONAN
Withdraw --Withdraw to the
redoubts

He turns like the others--running headlong in retreat

THE SEVENTH LEGION--Surge after them still held by their
Centurions to a fast ragged advance Everywhere in the Line
they surge and strain at the restraint

CLOSE FORTUNAS--Behind them Carnifexia beckoning

CARNIFEXIA
They are running Kill them all

METALLUS AT THE EMPEROR’S SIDE-They see over the Cohort’s backs
the Zingarans in scattered flight--ahead where the ravine
narrows a Line is forming again--the Wolf’s Head Standard flies
from a rock Fortunas turns to Metallus mad with frustration and
blood lust

FORTUNAS
You want it don’t you

METALLUS
What

FORTUNAS

You want it--for you--for your
own glory

METALLUS
What my Emperor

FORTUNAS
Victory

Metallus glances quickly up at the dark trees above--the steep
ravine walls--he glares back at Fortunas

METALLUS
Alright --You want a Crown of
Reeds That’s where they grow

He points to the Zingaran last stand

FORTUNAS
Centurions Release them Come
with me Aquilonians Follow my
sword

He whips his horses and charges--the whole Seventh breaks and
charges after him--the Cavalry Carnifexia--all go at the thin
line of Zingarans

CLOSE CONAN--Under the Wolf’s Head Standard

CONAN
Let them pass Pull back

They run up into the rocks as the Aquilonians thunder by Now
Conan on a rock hacks down those below who try and get him His
fellow Zingarans form into tight little shield walls to protect
themselves Others run towards the barricades at the river
where the women and old men are The Aquilonians hotly pursue in
a running melee

CUT TO
KON--High in the woods He sees now the terrible rout of his
father’s Legion But he also sees what it has done The Seventh
is an undisciplined rabble stretched out in a line of black in
the dust below
CONAN--Looks up

CONAN
Now Trumpets

Trumpets sound a new call A charge The Wolf’s Head is brought
to Conan’s side

TREES--Dark and steep suddenly fill with thousands of Picts
howling and waving steel swords--carrying steel shields they

hurl themselves down the slope

CLOSE ORLOCK MAC MORN--Waving his sword He is first amongst the
enemy--cleaving and hewing--blood coursing through the air

CLOSE CONAN--Descends into the fray

KON--Riding a horse down the steep slope engages first one
cavalryman then another from whom he wrestles a lance before
gutting him with the gladius

CIVILIANS--Brace as the chariots of Fortunas and Carnifexia run
uncontrolled into the barricade The vanguard of the screaming
Aquilonians catch up to them and a vicious killing ensues
Fortunas huris javelins then hacks down old men and women as they
‘close around him His chariot is turned over but he comes up
and hacks his way through to the river’s edge

PICTS--ZINGARANS--Descend upon the Aquilonians who are attacking
the old and the women The Legionaries are dragged down and
killed with mallets and spikes It is here that the full fury of
revolution takes hold

WOMEN--Hold up bloody helmets
SOLDIERS--Stab and chop already dead enemies
CUT TO

CONAN--Rushing to the river sees Carnifexia turn her chariot--
her sword red with the blood of women and children She tries to
make an escape back through the battle Conan stands in her
way-brings his axe across his chest She charges screaming like
a banshee wheeling her spatha She seems suspended in time an
image of unearthly demonic evil Her scream too is distorted and
drawn out As she thunders down on Conan the old King knows
what to do He has spent a lifetime fighting demons He feints
first to one side drawing the horses with the flash of his
blade then spins the other way letting his axe leap out from
him in a rounding backhand

Carnifexia’s howl is cut short by Conan’s axe crashing through
her chariot--shield and finally her waist above her right hip
Plate armor and blood flies and spatter Conan who rolls in the
dust and comes up to see her sagging in the chariot that runs a
circle and back to the river out of control

CLOSE AELDRA--In the thick of fighting wielding a spear She
sees the runaway chariot come across the lines of sharpened
stakes The driver sags holding onto its side The horses shy

from the pointed stakes and the chariot turns over in a
splintering crash

CARNIFEXIA--Impaled by a splintered stake and bleeding from her
cleaved side lands in the mud of the river bank She is sliding
down and grabs at the tufts of grass She looks up to see Aeldra
standing over a long spear in her hands Carnifexia cries out
in a feminine voice

CARNIFEXIA
Help me Please by Mitra help me

Aeldra puts the point of the spear against her breastplate and
with a little shove pushes her She slides into the river where
helpless from wounds and the weight of armor she thrashes as she
goes under

CUT TO

FORTUNAS--Running along the river bank--further down He is
encountered by one group of rebels then turns as others surround
him They have scythes and mallets small spikes and curved
knives

FORTUNAS
Do you know who I am

MAN
Yes Emperor we are your subjects

FORTUNAS
--And you intend me to end this way
It will cost you dearly

He grabs a spear-point pulls the man in--guts him with his
gladius and takes the spear

FORTUNAS
Have you no champion This is
just sport

Suddenly Kon pushes through and dismounts

KON
I am their champion I am their
prince and half a Pict--a fitting
match for you Alba Fortunas

FORTUNAS
Yes yes Publius Kon I’ve been
denied my pleasure at hurting you

KON
I think you denied nothing

He takes a lance from a man they square off It’s the same old
routine for which he was beaten thrust--parry--thrust
Fortunas’ point glances off Kon’s shoulder--Kon spins--changes
his grip Fortunas thrusts like he did that night in Conan’s
palace--Kon parries comes up the shaft turning with his own and
quickly spears the Emperor in his armpit He screams like a
woman and Kon spears him again through his face He quivers

Kon pulls back the spear standing on guard and Fortunas pitches
over headlong down the river bank Where he comes to rest--his
head in the river trailing crimson

THE GORGE--Conan walks through--the dead everywhere The Picts
are overwhelming knots of resistence and taking heads Orlock
Mac Morn has two heads he throws them down as he goes after an
Aquilonian officer Everywhere friend and foe are scattered--all
the way back up the gorge Conan is looking for something Some
of his men see him and walk with him Soon the Wolf’s Head
Standard is waving behind him His face is bloodied--his crown
dented by a sword blow It saved him Crassides limps at his
side helped by his sons

CLOSE METALLUS--Laying in the tangle of his broken chariot--an
arrow through his neck a Pictish falchion imbedded in his side
Dead Picts are in a pile under and around him his gladius
broken He looks vp as a shadow comes over him He sees Conan

METALLUS
They--they broke the Line my friend
--It was--Sacred

Conan nods

METALLUS
I never did--I never broke the Line--
A sword--

Conan leans down and puts a Pictish sword in his hand When he
does a weak laugh emits from Metallus as if he could get up and
fight He instead raises his sword to the sky

METALLUS
Now my friend--Now
Conan plunges his sword two handed through Metallus’ chest
faces come close together Metallus breathes his last breath
Conan’s his eyes thanking him--the sword falls from his hand
clatters across his armor

CUT TO

THEODESIA--Looking down from the battlements of the Palace
sees the figures retreating--the Frontier Legion standing in
defense--the dust smoke chaos from the gorge It is plain
Seventh Legion is no more and will never return

FELEXIO
Shall we assemble a relief force
and try and break through my
Empress

She looks sharply at him

THEODESIA
No Hold the Line here with the
Frontier Legion The Empresses’
Standard will conduct an orderly
withdrawal across the Thunder
River The Frontier Legion will
act as rear guard You may command

FELEXIO
And the Emperor

THEODESIA
He wanted martial glory I hope
he found it

He looks out sternly

THEODESIA
He also broke the Sacred Line
The Line--is what makes us strong
What separates us from savagery
Felexio You understand that

FELEXIO
I do my Empress

CUT TO
THE THUNDER RIVEROn the far side the Army of Aquilonia--

standards banners golden armor drilled disciplined troops
Already they are building palisades and defensive ditches

Behind them the Road of Kings that leads to Tarantia Capital of
the World

ON THIS SIDE--The unwashed masses of the people their tribes
the clans the warrior races Strongly built ragged men and
long-haired women--Picts Zingarans Cimmerians and other
barbarian peoples They wave weapons and totems in defiance

The swift and deep Thunder River separates their worlds King
Conan stands on the bank his arm around the blonde woman Aeldra
Nearby his strong son Kon sits a horse and the witch Diera looks
up at him The King’s Wizard throws a rock in the current its
splash and ripple quickly gone

CONAN

They live where men thirst for power
over others where they crave the
sanctity of scented waters golden
bowls and cloths of silk They hide
their need to enslave behind what they
call compassion and humanity--it is
a lie And then we must always be
waiting--vigilant in the dark for we
know the truth--We are the People
and between our world and theirs
is eternal war

(pause)
“For I would hurl your cities down
And I would break your shrines
And give the site of every town
To thistles and to vines
For all the works of cultured man
Must fare and fade and fall
We are the Dark Barbarians
That tower over all”

The Wizard looks up at him--out at the river and throws another
stone

THE END

But there is more--Conan Kon Aeldra and Diera must find their
destiny in the great struggle to come This too will be told in
“Beneath My Sandaled Feet” the final installment of

RE Howard’s “Conan”
