‘CLUE

FADE IN

EXT A HOUSE ON A HILL - NIGHT
MUSIC

We are looking up at a house It stands some distance
away on a hill From the moment WE SEE it we know that
it is a house of terror -- imposing Gothic gloomy ©
menacing Perhaps it is reminiscent of the house in
Psycho perhaps - though not a castle -- it has the
deserted soulless empty quality of Kanes house when
‘seen first ‘through its gates

The MUSIC WE HEAR is Thriller music urgent strings

‘suggesting panic suggesting “unspoken evil ‘Bernard

Hermann sort-of-music

And the weather is overcast There is a watery moon
struggling to break through racing clouds -But a
thunderstorm is on the way

Superimpose MAIN TITLES

A car turns off a ‘highway onto a country lane ‘leading
towards the house The car would not be the-cats whiskers
even in the year in which this story takes place

END TITLES - SUPERIMPOSE 1954

‘CAMERA “CRANES DOWN -and MOVES WITH the car AS it approaches

the gates of the house They are closed A man gets out
of the car He is a BUTLER He is dressed like a butler

He has the manner of a butler Even when opening gates

all alone he does so with the demeanour of a butler ‘His
name is WADSWORTH -Having opened the gates he sits back
in his car and motors slowly up the private drive

EXT ‘THE ‘FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

As THE BUTLER scar draws to a halt there isa distant
RUMBLE of THUNDER Lights can be seen through some of

the ground floor windows A savage looking German Shepherd

snarls and bares his teeth at the arriving car Another
German Shepherd is crapping on top of the front steps
Both dogs are chained up

WADSWORTH gets out of the car locks it methodically and
mounts the steps to the front-door ‘One of the dogs leaps
at him trying to attack him He throws a chunk of raw
meat at the dogs They fall upon it hungrily and retreat
to the side of the steps WADSWORTH is relieved

He steps back eyes them - satisfied - producesa kev
from his overcoat pocket turns steps in the dog

INT THE HALL - NIGHT

Methodically WADSWORTH opens the front door It creaks
He comes in sniffs makes a face scrapes his shoe shuxs
the door hangs up his-coat-on the coat stand He wears
a black jacket white tie stiff collar and pinstripe

“trousers ‘He walks across the marble floor his -foot-

steps echoing on the cold grey stone He stops at the
open Dining Room door and looks in The table is
beautifully and meticulously laid for dinner for seven

INT THE LIBRARY - NIGHT

YVETTE is the Prench Maid She is young beautiful with
a-great figure which is tightly encased in a maids uni-
form -- black dress little white apron and cap sheer
black stockings and dainty black shoes But the skirt is

‘shorter than normal and very tight over her bottom --

and her black dress is very low cut Her ample bosom is
pushed right up and half out of the top of the dress

She is an outrageous young lady with an improbable French
accent which cannot be reproduced on the page She has
been polishing a glass and dancing to the latest poo
music on the radio She bends forward to replace the
glass on the tray her breasts falling beautifully forwarc
WADSWORTH watches

WADSWORTH
Is everything ready

YVETTE
Oui Monsieur

WADSWORTH
You have your instructions

WADSWORTH leaves the library YVETTE sniffs and makes a

face WADSWORTH crosses the hall to the kitchen

forming characteristically at a hearing on the House
Committee of Un-American Activities (Actual film)

“ “WADSWORTH
‘Forgive me but tonight you may
well feel obliged to my employer -
for the use of a pseudonym

COLONEL MUSTARD didnt quite get all that WADSWORTH

COLONEL eyes himsuspiciously and sniffs the air and
then looks at his-own feet

COLONEL MUSTARD
Who are you

WADSWORTH

And he leads the way across the Hall COLONEL MUSTARD
enters with reluctance and suspicion looking up and
around the high cold Gothic hall lit by a flickering
chandelier and shafts of moonlight stealing through the
stained glass windows

She is holding a letter

CA MRS WHITE

WADSWORTH
Only that you are to be known
as Mrs White

MRS WHITE

After eating in Silence for a while MRS PEACOCK speaks
nervously

“ -

All-heads turn towards her She loses her nerve
momentarily then continues ‘speaking rather too quickly
with a slight air of hysteria

MRS PEACOCK
(continuing)
Somebodys got to break the ice
so it might as well be me I mean
Im used to being a hostess its
part of my husbands work and
‘its always difficult when a group
of new friends meet together for

were doing here or what -
‘doing ‘here or what this plate is
about but Im determined to enjoy
myself and very intrigued and oh -
my this soup is delicious isnt
it

There is a pause They all still looking at her

MRS WHITE
You say you are used to being a
hostess as part of your husbands

food -- a couple of bland looking main dishes with rice
noodles and so forth MRS PEACOCK tastes it

MRS PEACOCK
Mmm Delicious
(she glances admiringly
through the serving hatch)
This is one of my favorite recipes
WADSWORTH - edges in front of the pass- through so that
MRS PEACOCK cannot ‘see the COOK

WADSWORTH

She looks at him with further curiosity WADSWORTH
starts to pour the wine ‘topping up-one or two glasses

MRS PEACOCK
‘So what do you do in Washington o

MR GREEN smiles and shakes his head MRS PEACOCK
persists

MRS PEACOCK
(continuing)

Wadsworth -- where is our host
and why have -we been brought here

WADSWORTH smiles enigmatically And the DOORBELL RINGS

INT THE HALL

- WADSWORTH walks down the Hall to the front door TENSE

MUSIC He opens the door and standing there is an

-unprepossessing MAN One might almost describe him as

ugly if one were feeling charitable ‘Certainly his
‘features are ordinary enough but there is about him an

‘air of malevolence bitterness -- perhaps even evil He
also bites his nails and picks ‘his teeth nose and other
orifices He carries a-small locked suitcase As the

door opens there is a tremendous flash of lightning and

-a CRASH ‘OF THUNDER

WADSWORTH seems pleased to see him in an-odd sort of way
WADSWORTH
Ah Mr Boddy You are eagerly
awaited

(Cs MR BODDY
Na I find that hard to believe
This is not your place I take
it
WADSWORTH

No sir It is on loan

He steps aside to allow MR BODDY to enter He does
MR BODDY looks WADSWORTH up and down with a sneer on
his already unpleasant features

MR BODDY
‘And what are you supposed to ‘be

WADSWORTH is closing the front door The wind is howling

WADSWORTH
Im supposed to be polite
Though when talking to you I
find that the task is almost
beyond me

“They are talking loudly enough to be heard in the Dining
Room

Nn 25

All SIX GUESTS are listening to the conversation in the
Hall So is YVETTE ©

INT THE DINING ROOM

WADSWORTH

As you wish -- it contains
evidence I presume

MR BODDY
Surprises my friend Thats
what it contains -- surprises

He puts it under the coat rack As he does so WADSWORTH
‘turns back to the frontdoor and locks it witha deadlock key

MR BODDY
(continuing)
May I see that key

WADSWORTH
Over my dead body sir

MR BODDY gives a little smile ‘Wadsworth sets off
across the Hall to the Dining Room MR BODDY follows

WADSWORTH
(continuing)
Have you just arrived from
Washington sir

MR BODDY
“yes its a long haul

WADSWORTH
‘(looking up and around)
- Indeed it is a long hall But
“then its a very large ‘house

MR BODDY
(unpleasantly)
You think youre quite a fellow
dont you
INT DINING ROOM

All the GUESTS are eating in silence WADSWORTH enters

°

followed by MR BODDY Everyone turns to look at’MR BODDY

as he enters He stops dead slightly frightened when

he

sees them all They look at him with curiosity It should

be clear to us that he recognizes them but none of them

recognizes him

28 - C ¥ MR GREEN

ee (eventually)
I got -a similar letter

MISS SCARLET
(to PROFESSOR PLUM)
So did we didnt we

MR BODDY
Ialso received a letter

Meanwhile YVETTE has been placing the main course in front
‘of MR BODDY ‘He waves it away

-MR BODDY
(continuing)
No thanks Yvette Im not
hungry

MR GREEN flashes a look at them both Again he is quick
on the uptake

“MR ‘(GREEN
How did you know -her ‘name

MR BODDY smiles at YVETTE and slides his hand up
her skirt ‘She edges away disgusted

q

MR ‘BODDY
-We know each other dont we
dear

She nods almost imperceptibly
WADSWORTH

Forgive my curiosity Mr Boddy
but did your letter say the same
i

thing
MR BODDY
(brusque)
No
WADSWORTH

I see Can I interest any of you
in fruit or dessert

No one is ‘interested They shake their heads Much of
the main course has been left uneaten

( )
24

28 WADSWORTH
(continuing)
In that case May I suggest
that we adjourn to the Study
for coffee and brandy at which
point I believe our unknown
host will reveal his intentions

They all rise The MEN stand aside to let the LADIES
out first

COLONEL MUSTARD
Ladies first

WADSWORTH signals to YVETTE to start clearing the

table
29A INT THE HALL oe
COLONEL MUSTARD and MISS SCARLET are conversing as

they cross the hall

COLONEL MUSTARD
(continuing)
If hes in the study why didnt
he join us for dinner

MISS -SCARLET
Well I‘m-certainly looking forward
to meeting him

298 INT THE STUDY

We see the Study It is empty The GUESTS led by
‘WADSWORTH cross the Hall from ‘the Dining -Room and
enter the Study ‘They ‘stop ‘and look around

MR GREEN
(surprised)
Theres no one here

MISS SCARLET
Mind if I -smoke

She offers cigarettes aroung PROFESSOR PLUM -takes one
-and lights them both up

’ WADSWORTH
Please help yourselves to coffee
and brandy and be seated

And he crosses to the desk past a blazing log fire On
‘the desk there is a plain brown envelope simply addressed
TQ WADSWORTH PLEASE OPEN AFTER DINNER He picks it up
They settle on chairs and sofas around the room

©

It is a comfortable room dak paneled chintz covered
upholstered’ chairs and sofa forming a contrast with the
heavy leather furniture in the Library and the -elegance

-of the Dining Room

Unlike the other rooms which have

25

wooden parquet flooring the Study has Persian rugs over

a soft wall-to-wall carpet

Sitting in a silence as they all watch him WADSWORTH
picks up a fancy letter opener and opens the brown

Manilla envelope

He withdraws a short letter He

glances at it then looks around replacing the envelope

on the desk

WADSWORTH

(continuing)

Ladies

and gentlemen I am

instructed to explain to you
what you all have in common
with each other Unless

(he glances a MR BODDY)
«s unless you would care to
do the honors Mr Boddy

MR BODDY

‘consults the contents -of the ‘envelope which he» opened ‘in

‘MR ‘BODDYis running into the room -which like all

conservatories is mostly made of glass

He jumps onto a ledge at the far end and picks up a
‘flower pot preparatory to breaking the glass
WADSWORTH almost runs into the Conservatory

‘WADSWORTH

“MISS ‘SCARLET looks at-him with a smile MRS PEACOCK
with disgust

MRS PEACOCK
How disgusting —

“WADSWORTH turns to MRS PEACOCK

WADSWORTH
Are you making moral judgements
Mrs -Peacock -How ‘then -do -you
justify taking bribes in return
for delivering your husband
Senator Peacocks vote to certain
lobbyists

MRS PEACOCK
My husbands a paid consultant
Theres nothing wrong with that

WADSWORTH
Not if its publicly declared
But if the payment is delivered by
slipping used greenbacks in-plain
envelopes under the door of the
mens room how would you describe
that transaction ©

‘MISS SCARLET
Id say it stank

MRS PEACOCK

a telephone service which provides

MRS PEACOCK is appalled

MRS PEACOCK

She stares at PROFESSOR PLUM disgust written all over
her face But MR GREEN is thinking

MR GREEN
So how did you know that Colonel
Mustard works in Washington Is

COLONEL MUSTARD
Certainly not

He stands and walks over to the window

MR GREEN
I was asking Miss Scarlet
COLONEL MUSTARD turns on MISS SCARLET The dialogue is
going very fast

COLONEL MUSTARD
Tell them its not true

MISS SCARLET
(obediently)
Its not true

‘PROFESSOR -PLUM
Is that true

“MISS SCARLET
No thats not true

MR GREEN
(triumphantly)
Aha So it is true

WADSWORTH
A double negative

COLONEL MUSTARD
(horrified)
A double negative You mean
you have - photographs

MISS SCARLET nods

WADSWORTH
That sounds like a confession
to me In fact the double
negative has led to proof positive
(to COLONEL MUSTARD)
Im afraid you gave yourself
away sir

35 COLONEL MUSTARD
Are you trying to make me look
stupid in front of the other
guests

WADSWORTH
(smoothly)
You dont need any help from
me sir

-PROFESSOR PLUM
But seriously I dont see
whats so terrible about Colonel
Mustard visiting a house «of ill-
fame Most ‘soldiers -do dont they

PROFESSOR PLUM puts his hand on her knee She removes
it Reluctantly he moves away WADSWORTH refers to
his notes the ones which came out of the brown enve-
lope which are still in his hand

WADSWORTH
But he holds a sensitive security
‘post in the Pentagon -And «Colonel
-you -drive a very expensive car ‘for
someone who lives on a Colonels pay

COLONEL MUSTARD
sI-dont I-came into -money During the
war When I lost my parents

WADSWORTH
You lost them Did you report the loss
to the police

COLONEL MUSTARD
No dying is perfectly legal

MRS WHITE
I dont want a scandal Wed

hated me He had threatened to

kill me in public

MISS SCARLET
Why would he want to kill you
in public

WADSWORTH
I think she meant that he had
threatened in public to kill her

MISS SCARLET
And was that his final word on
the matter

MRS WHITE
Being killed is pretty final
wouldnt you say

‘WADSWORTH
And yet he was the-one who died

Merely that you “were all meeting

each of them in turn as he speaks

speculatively weapons at the ready

This quiet observation produces a fearful silence They
all look at each other nervously aware that a murderer
is present amongst ‘them

MR GREEN
I didnt do it

“MRS PEACOCK
I need -a drink

She puts down the dagger and picks up the brandy goblet
that MR BODDY placed on the table near the door just
before the lights went out She raises it to her lips

-and sips a little

‘PROFESSOR PLUM
Maybe he was poisoned

MRS PEACOCK screams and drops the glass She continues
screaming hysterically After some moments of continued
screaming MR GREEN slaps her face

‘This stops her abruptly

half-lying on the sofa - hurry over to look at the brandy
goblet But it lies broken on the floor

‘WADSWORTH -
When I said that I was Mr Boddys
‘butler this was both true and
misleading I was once his butler
but it was not his untimely death
this evening which brought -my
employment with him to an end 0h
no

COLONEL MUSTARD
When did it come to an end

WADSWORTH
‘When my wife decided ‘to end
her life She too was being
blackmailed by this odious man
who now lies dead before us He
hated my wife for the same reason
that he hated all of you He
believed that you were all thoroughly
un-American For some reason he
felt it was inappropriate ‘for a
‘Senator to have a corrupt wife for
a doctor to screw his patients for
a wife to emasculate her husband
and so forth

‘He is speaking wihtout irony WADSWORTH is a very

sincere fellow who always tries to understand

MR GREEN
But this is ridiculous If he was
such a patriotic American why
didnt he report us to the relevant
authorities

WADSWORTH
He decided to turn his ‘information
‘to good use and make a little money
out of it What could be more
American than that -MrBoddy was
truly an apostle of free enterprise
He became -a rich man

Mr Boddy threatened to give my
wifes name to the House

‘Un-American Activities Committee
unless she named them She
refused -- and so he blackmailed
her We had no money -- and the
price of his silence was that we
worked forhim for nothing ‘We
‘were slaves ‘Well to-makea

- long story ‘short

COLONEL MoSTARD
(to MRS PEACOCK)
Too late

WADSWORTH
The suicide of my wife preyed
on my mind and created a sense
Of injustice in me and I
resolved to put Mr Boddy béhind
bars It seemed to me that-the
best way to-do it --and to free
all of you from the same burden
‘of Blackmail -- was ‘to get -us all
face ‘to face confront Mr Boddy
with his crimes extract a
confession and then turn him over
to the police

PROFESSOR PLUM stands and locks at the OTHERS relieved
that he understands what has been going on

PROFESSOR PLUM
