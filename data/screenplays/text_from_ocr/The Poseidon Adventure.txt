EXT MEDITERRANEAN SEA - NIGHT 2

Titles and credits appear over a series of shots of the great ship as she
fights her way through waves of staggering height churning with furious
force Titles continue through the following

ANOTHER ANGLE - POSEIDON - NIGHT ao 3

Her bow dips then rises as though trying to catch her breath then dips
again exposing her four screws above the surface of her stern

of tons of water as it rises again we catch the ships name POSEIDON

A breathtakingly beautiful blinding sunrise is now the background to the
continuing battle of the old ship against the overwhelming sea

EXT DECK AREA - SS POSEIDON - DAY - 6

Its now early morning on the almost deserted upper deck No more
than three or four hardy passengers are daring the elements A boy of

blond hair and a wiry little body hardened by growing up in the surf of
Manhattan Beach California

INT BRIDGE OF POSEIDON - DAY 8

In this high place the full effect of the heavy swells can be felt
Through the windows of the bridge we canmeasure their height against
the rise and fall-of the horizon The HELMSMAN clings to his helm
aJUNIOR OFFICER holds on to-a stanchion the FIRST OFFICER steadies
himself at the engine room telegraph and a RADAR QUARTERMASTER
guards his set with difficulty The CAPTAIN isa tall man in his late
fifties elegant-looking but strong Another MAN dressed in a business
suit watches the crew narrowlymissing nothing

irritation and frustration

INT ENGINE ROOM - DAY 11

This is the heartbeat of the ship As far as the eye can see in every
direction huge gears interlocked with other huge gears respond to the
power released by the generators They groan with the agony of age
but the pulse of power is deafening An ASSISTANT ENGINEER who is
at the loudaphone at the log desk answers the Captain

ASSISTANT ENGINEER
Aye aye sir

He turns to a WIPER standing nearby and calls over

ASSISTANT ENGINEER
The Chiefs working on the generator --
tell him the Captain wants him on the
phone

Reverend Scott is conducting the ships religious service on the sundeck
The ships Chaplain sits to one side somewhat anxiously Among the
congregation we find Susan Robin Mr Martin and some ships officers
Scott looks around at the faces He speaks easily but his intensity
grows during the sermon

SCOTT
You know Gods pretty busy Hes
got a long-term plan for humanity that
stretches far beyond our comprehension

So its not reasonable to expect Him to
concern Himself only with the individual
The individual is important only to the
extent that he’s a creative link between
the past and the future - in his children
or in the contribution he makes to humanity
Oh that doesnt mean that God has forgotten
us On the contrary hes given to each
and every one of us a great and infinite ©
gift - a part of Himself -- aspark from
His eternal fire to be nurtured within us --—

- to keep us warm to strengthen our efforts
Therefore dont pray to God to solve your
problems -- pray to that part of God within
you Have the guts to fight for yourself

ROBIN

Gotta go to the john --

You already did You sit right there
