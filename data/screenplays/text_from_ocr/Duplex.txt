INT APARTMENT — PARLOR

Matthew leads Nancy and Alex in from the hallway One wall is
filled with a ornate hutch on another is an oak fireplace
with an antique mirror above the mantle There is carved wood
everywhere It’s real estate porn

KENNETH
The parlor

ALEX
(ceferring to listing
sheet in his hand)
Built in 1881 So that would
make this Victorian

NANCY KENNETH
Queen Anne

Nancy twirls around the parlor slowly

NANCY
This entire house is an antique

Alex subtly gives Nancy a “remember what we discussed” look
She assumes her “buyer’s face”

NANCY
Of course we’re in no hurry

KENNETH
Perhaps this isn’t for you then
I’m sure it’ll be sold by Monday

Nancy digs her nails deeply into Alex’s arm

KENNETH

A lot of story there
Doyle Draft 011502 3

NANCY
Can you imagine all the furniture
that’s lived here over the years

Kenneth gestures to an alcove of bookshelves

KENNETH
This is the library

ALEX
(can’t stop himself)
Wow

Nancy playfully shoots him an exaggerated “buyer’s face” He
laughs busted

NANCY
Alex is a writer

KENNETH
(doesn’t give a shit)
Really What do you write

ALEX
(modestly)
I wrote a book you probably never
heard of it “Unbodied Souls”

NANCY
It was nominated for all sorts of
first novel awards

KENNETH
(not apologetic)
I don’t read books

NANCY
Alex is almost done with his second
novel Which would look great
(spokesmodel flourish)
in these magnificent built-in
Nineteenth Century bookcases

Alex obviously likes that idea But

ALEX
Too bad it’s out of our price
range

NANCY

(gesturing)
It is at the top of our price
range
Doyle Draft 011502 4

ALEX
(gesturing above her)
Over the top

NANCY
(intertwining her fingers
with his)
At the tippy top

KENNETH
Would you like to see the bedroom

NANCY
Yes please

INT APARTMENT — BEDROOM DOOR

Kenneth pushes open a large wooden accordion divider He’s
saved the best for last

They walk into the light Nancy actually GASPS The bedroom
is huge there is a curved front window area that looks out
to the leafy street

As they walk into the center of the room Alex steps on a
floorboard that CREAKS LOUDLY He stops to look down at it

Nancy semi-pirouettes over to the fireplace Kenneth follows

KENNETH
Fireplace is tiger-eye maple—

He is interrupted by SEVERAL CREAKS He looks over to see
Alex STEPPING REPEATEDLY on the creaky floorboard

ALEX
(re floorboard)
That could get annoying

KENNETH
Yes
(back to fireplace)
If you look closely you’1ll see it’s
actually hundreds of hand-carved
pieces fitted perfectly together

NANCY
(caressing fireplace)
Who could have done this

KENNETH
Craftsmen
Doyle Draft 011502 5

NANCY
I miss craftsman

KENNETH
And over here you’ve got a little
alcove if that’s the word a round
outcropping

NANCY
A nook
(excitedly to Alex)
A writer’s nook

Alex looks at the nook and out the windows at the park He
is buying into the fantasy

ALEX
A writer’s nook

NANCY
(innocently caught up)
Or it could be a nursery
(notices something)
Ew

The opposite wall contains a large interior window that has
been painted over for some reason Nancy approaches it
frowning but then looks more closely She scratches at the
paint which flakes off in several layers

NANCY
Is there stained glass under here

KENNETH
(unctuous smile)
Could be
INT APARTMENT — FOYERPARLOR
The three emerge from the bedroom
KENNETH
Youve got my card if you want to
make an offer
Alex’s attention is caught by a large spiral planter
NANCY (0C)
Can you call us if anybody else

makes one

KENNETH (0C)
I’m not supposed to but
Doyle Draft 011502 6

Over the proceeding we follow Alex’s gaze up the planter
The plants still have price tags The wrought-iron planter
spirals to the top where a rather obvious circular piece of
wood has been painted white to match the ceiling

ALEX
Excuse me is this a stairway

Now that he mentions it it very clearly is a spiral
staircase Kenneth doesn’t miss a beat

KENNETH
Oh I’m sorry I thought you
realized This is a duplex

ALEX
There’s another floor

KENNETH
It’s on the listing sheet In your
hand

Alex looks at the listing sheet Fucking Kenneth is right

NANCY
(a little worried)
Why’s it sealed off Were there a
slew of murders up there You have
to tell us if there were

KENNETH
Oh nothing like that It’s just
there’s a sweet old lady who lives
up there

ALEX
A tenant

KENNETH
Yes and it is rent-controlled so
but she’s so sweet and so
(annoying chuckle)
she’s gotta be a hundred years old

ALEX
(good-natured sigh)
Well that’s unfortunate because--

NANCY
Can we meet her

Kenneth CHUCKLES in a chortling sort of way
Doyle Draft 011502 7

INT BROWNSTONE — LOBBY
As they climb the stairs Nancy caresses the banisters

ALEX
Rent-controlled means we can’t kick
her out right

NANCY
Alex

INT BROWNSTONE — SECOND FLOOR LANDING — CONTINUOUS
Kenneth stops at a door in mid-landing

KENNETH
(that chuckle again)
A legitimate question No you
can’t evict her She has to decide
to leave or
(as if changing subject)
Poor dear hasn’t been feeling well

He KNOCKS loudly

KENNETH (CONT )
She’s hard of hearing

The three stand there for a long beat

KENNETH (CONT )
It may take a little while for her
to get to the door

They all smile at each other After another longish beat we
hear a lock being LABORIOUSLY OPENED on the other side There
is another beat

KENNETH (CONT )
(mouthing low volume)
Arthritis

We hear a second lock being opened with a LONG GRINDING
CREAK A moment later the door opens slowly JERKING to a
halt at the end of the security chain

Nancy’s eyes widen in expectation Alex is curious Their
expressions flash to shock then polite suppression of shock

INSIDE THE DOOR

Peering behind the chain is MRS CONNELLY She’s a tiny
frail lady in a housecoat that may be as old as she is
Doyle Draft 011502 8

She stares unblinkingly this combined with her total lack
of make-up makes her looks more than a little like a corpse
After a moment her face flashes in recognition she smiles
sweetly and speaks with a slight Irish brogue

MRS CONNELLY
Kenneth

KENNETH
Good afternoon Mrs Connelly How
are you feeling today

MRS CONNELLY
Oh don’t let me burden you with my
troubles
(then)
I don’t feel good Kenneth

ON KENNETH
Nancy peeks over his shoulder into the apartment

KENNETH
I’m sorry to hear that I’ve
brought by a young couple who
might want to buy the apartment

Kenneth steps back to reveal Nancy on tip-toe she drops down
quickly and interlocks arms with Alex

NANCY
Good afternoon Mrs Connelly I’m
Nancy and this is my husband

Alex
ALEX
(tiny wave)
Hello
NANCY

Do you mind if we look around
NANCY’S POV

As Mrs Connelly speaks Nancy’s gaze drifts above her head
She sees only a sliver another magnificent fireplace its
mantle draped with Catholic memento mori

MRS CONNELLY (OVER PRECEDING)
It’s in a horrible state Haven’t
had the energy to tidy up in ages
I can only imagine what it must
smell like
Doyle Draft 011502 9

NANCY
We’ll be in and out ina jif

MRS CONNELLY
Sorry dear I don’t feel up to it

The door CLOSES on Nancy’s face We hear the door slowly
being LOCKED again Then from behind the door

MRS CONNELLY (0C)
(Long sad coughing tiny squeak of
sickly despair)

Nancy and Alex are thinking the same thing

KENNETH
Poor dear

EXT BROWNSTONE — STOOP
Kenneth gestures across the street
KENNETH
And you’ve got the park right
there of course
Nancy sees kids in the park She emits a YEARNING SIGH
KENNETH (CONT )
Shame you’re not ready to buy But
there’1ll be other places Not as
special but Maybe we should look a
little deeper into Brooklyn

Alex takes one look and his crestfallen wife and

ALEX
Well take it

EXT LOWER EAST SIDE — SIXTH STREET — NIGHT

Alex and Nancy sit in the window of a restaurant A neon sign
above them reads “NY Delhi”

INT NY DELHI — CONTINUOUS

A cheesy pairing of traditional Indian kitsch and faux hip A
sitar-lead combo plays an Indian-inflected “Mood Indigo”

Alex is happily eating Nancy is too happy to eat
Doyle Draft 011502 10

ALEX
Nobody does tandoori like these
guys I don’t care if the rumors
are true

NANCY
(gleefully)
We bought a house

ALEX
(mouth full)
If the bank gives us the money

NANCY
They’1l give us the money Banks
love giving people money Besides
we make enough weve got my
salary you’re getting the rest of
your advance when you hand in the
book my Christmas bonus my annual
raise and let’s not forget the
royalties from your book

Alex LAUGHS
NANCY

There’s gonna be scads of
royalties Your book is so good

Alex
ALEX

Itd be better if it was finished
NANCY

Well now you’ve got a writer’s

nook
ALEX

(fondly)

It is a great nook
Nancy brings a forkful of food to her mouth then

NANCY
What rumors

EXT TOMPKIN SQUARE PARK IN MANHATTAN — NIGHT

The couple walk along cradling Starbucks™ cups Nancy is
practically skipping and half circling Alex with giddy
energy Alex is thoroughly enjoying her delight he playfully
baits her
Doyle Draft 011502 11

ALEX
You do realize that once we move to
Brooklyn we won’t be able to walk
to our favorite Indian restaurant
and pick up extra-hot-no foam-
lattes on the way home

NANCY
Well eat take-out in front of one
of our several fireplaces

They pass a scruffy gentleman in a long coat

SCRUFFY GENTLEMAN
(not so sotto)
Smoke Smoke

ALEX
And what if we want to buy drugs

NANCY
We won’t need drugs We won’t be
able to afford them anyway

ALEX
C’mon Nance admit it You’re
gonna miss this park

CRAZY WOMAN
Youre killing the frogs

The woman swings at Alex deliberately KNOCKING his extra-hot
latte all over the front of his pants

CRAZY WOMAN (0C)
A harbinger

Steam rises from Alex’s crotch

ALEX
Oh-christ Hot Hot

Alex pulls anxiously at the pants trying to air them out He
sighs relieved then

ALEX
Now cold
(he starts walking)
Really cold

He walks briskly off-screen leaving Nancy standing there
Doyle Draft 011502 12

INT EAST VILLAGE APARTMENT — NIGHT

It’s one room with “areas” designated by the placement of
mismatched pieces of furniture The “office’ is a clawtooth
bathtub in the kitchen an ibook sits on a wooden board
laying across it There are stacks of books everywhere and
no where to walk Paintings and wall-hangings sit on the
floor because there is nowhere to hang them etc

BARELY MUFFLED STREET NOISES invade the space

The “bedroom” sits behind a Chinese scrim The couple lies in
bed in the “dark” (Streetlight through the barred windows
casts a classic prison shadow across the couple)Alex is on
his back uncomfortable Nancy peeks under the covers

NANCY
Does it still hurt

ALEX
Yes Yes it does

NANCY
Should I rub some cream on it or
something

ALEX
No that’s okay

NANCY
I was really looking forward to
sexing you up tonight

ALEX
(sadly)
Yeah Me too

NANCY
Oh You just wait until we get into
our romantic Queen Anne duplex
(suggestively)
with so many separate rooms

The enormity of it suddenly hits Alex

ALEX
We’re going to be homeowners

From the street we hear a HUGE GARBAGE TRUCK A car drives
by its STEREO violating noise ordinances Nancy cuddles up
next to Alex and closes her eyes
Doyle Draft 011502 13

ALEX
It will be nice to get a decent
night’s sleep for once

Then right below their window

YOUNG DRUNKEN MAN (0C)
I’m gonna kill the shit out of you

ANOTHER YOUNG DRUNKEN MAN (0C)
Famous last words Famous last
words

From below we hear two men KILLING THE SHIT OUT OF EACH
OTHER smashing GARBAGE CANS and setting off CAR ALARMS
Nancy nuzzles Alex Alex smiles and closes his eyes

EXT BROWNSTONE — PARK SLOPE BROOKLYN — SUNDAY MORNING

A “MOVE-A-MUSCLE” moving van is double-parked in the street
Huge hunky fellows unload boxes and furniture

Music “Happy Days Are Here Again” by Lucinda Williams

Alex in blue jeans and sweatshirt sips from his new no-
spill metal coffee cup He approaches the truck signalling
them to hand him a box One of the fellows happily tosses
Alex a box which it turns out is quite heavy

INT APARTMENT — PARLOR — CONTINUOUS

A mover is about to put a box down when Nancy stops him She
directs his attention to a Xerox on the wall drawn on it is
a crude layout of the apartment with various colored round
stickers on it The sticker on the box is red not Dayglow™
orange like on the layout Nancy directs him to a different
corner of the same room He walks a few feet and puts the box
down Nancy smiles

EXT BROWNSTONE — CONTINUOUS

Alex helps two movers unload a large TV from the truck He
takes a sip of water and then looks up to see the two
“movers” make off down the sidewalk with the TV Before he
can do anything two of the real movers take off after the
would-be thieves

INT APARTMENT — PARLOR — LATE AFTERNOON

Assorted boxes and furniture that doesn’t really fit in a
mixture of Ikea and kitschy fifties and sixties stuff Most
notable though is how small and insignificant it looks
dwarfed in the space
Doyle Draft 011502 14

Alex and Nancy survey the scene
ALEX
I could have sworn we had more
stuff
Nancy paces the floor working it out
NANCY
It’ll be fine once we spread it
out Maybe we need to add a couple
small pieces for accent maybe a
couple of big pieces to anchor
it
Alex arches an eyebrow half seriously
NANCY
You can get me a couch for
Christmas

She kisses his cheek Suddenly she excitedly grabs his hand
and yanks him backwards out of the room

INT APARTMENT — BEDROOM — CONTINUOUS
Nancy arrives in the doorway Alex in tow

Golden light pours into the room Nancy turns to Alex her
eyes welling up in sublime joy

NANCY
Welcome home Alex Kendricks

She kisses him deeply In unison they move to the bed The
floorboard SQUEAKS but they ignore it They fall on the bed
kissing

CLOSE ON ALEX AND NANCY

Smooching

SFX Distinctive PITTER-PATTER OF FEET above them

Alex and Nancy hear this but continue kissing

SFX The PITTER-PATTER going in the opposite direction

They both open their eyes and stop kissing Nancy stares up
at the ceiling
Doyle Draft 011502 15

NANCY
How old do you think poor old Mrs
Connelly is

Alex rolls off Nancy lying face up on the bed

ALEX
That image is going to hard to get
out of my head

NANCY
We should go say hello

ALEX
Let’s

Alex sits up and heads for the door

NANCY
Not dressed like that

INT BROWNSTONE — SECOND FLOOR LANDING

Alex in slacks pullover sweater and tie looks as
uncomfortable as a twelve-year-old going to visit his
grandmother He holds a bottle of wine with a red ribbon on
it Nancy in a conservative sweater set and wool skirt
licks her fingers and smooths down Alex’s hair

We hear the locks all OPEN as laboriously as before The
door CREAKS open to the end of the chain and we again see
Mrs Connelly’s suspicious eye Only now it’s surrounded by
bright blue eye shadow

NANCY
(a little loudly)
Mrs Connelly It’s Nancy and Alex
From downstairs

MRS CONNELLY’S EYE (MOUTH OC)
Ohhhh Oh

She SLAMS the door We hear the chain being UNHOOKED She
opens the door again Mrs Connelly wearing make-up usually
reserved for the wake stands there in a red satin cheongsam
(that mandarin slip dress that was briefly popular 40 years
ago) covered with a tiny pink sweater jacket

MRS CONNELLY
Come in Come in

Mrs Connelly patters in The parlor is dominated by a huge
brass-plated birdcage containing a giant macaw
Doyle Draft 011502 16

Abutting it is a ratty vinyl chair next to an even rattier
couch all oriented toward an old TV (with knobs) on a brass-
plated rolling cart

NANCY
You have a lovely apartment Mrs
Connelly

MRS CONNELLY
Oh please call me Josie

ALEX
(offering wine)
We got you this Josie Ah
Housewarming

MRS CONNELLY
(accepting bottle)
Oh I don’t drink dear It’s a
sin

ALEX
(interesting fact)
Irish Catholics don’t drink

Nancy pinches his side

MRS CONNELLY
Sit down sit down

Mrs Connelly gently pushes Nancy and Alex over to the
sitting area She directs Alex to the easy chair

MRS CONNELLY
You sit in my chair

Alex looks down in the seat of the chair It has a very
distinct slightly greasy impression in it

MRS CONNELLY
(re wine)
Let me open this for you

Mrs Connelly patters away We notice for the first time that
the back of her dress is completely worn away revealing
saggy gray old lady underpants She disappears down the
hallway Alex looks around

The magnificent parlor is crammed with Irish Catholic
tchotchkes praying hands sculpture assorted Lladro
figurines mostly from the angel series Jesi everywhere

ALEX
This must be what heaven is like
Doyle Draft 011502 17

Nancy looks around the room mentally redecorating

MRS CONNELLY (0C)
Here dear

Mrs Connelly returns carrying a bartender’s corkscrew and a
small glass She hands Alex the glass which we now see is an
old Peter Potamous jelly jar Mrs Connelly then places the
wine bottle between her knees and with one swift motion
UNCORKS it She pours Alex an inch of wine puts the bottle
down and patters out of the room again without saying
anything

Alex turns toward the macaw

It’s a sad specimen hunched over feathers missing Suddenly
it LUNGES toward camera Its beak comes through the bars
missing Alex’s eyeball by a 32nd of an inch

Alex lurches back and settles himself with a swallow of
wine He eases back into the chair He feels something funny
He lifts up his arm adjacent to the cage and sees the armrest
is speckled with white and green clumps

MRS CONNELLY (0C)
And some snacks

Mrs Connelly places a black lacquer tray on the brass-plated
glass coffee table The tray features a Polynesian dancer
whose toplessness has been strategically covered by a bowl
full of Bugles™ and a container of Onion Dip half empty with
numerous Bugle™ strafings in it

ALEX
Wow they still make Bugles™

Mrs Connelly holds a Bugle™ up to the cage The bird gently
takes it by the tip and rears its head back

BIRD
(BUGLE-LIKE TOOTLE)

ALEX
That’s a great parrot you have
there

MRS CONNELLY
He’s a macaw dear I’ve had Mr
Fawkes for sixty years now

As Mrs Connelly speaks she drags a Bugle methodically
through the dip
Doyle Draft 011502 18

Without saying a word she sticks it right under Alex’s nose
close enough that her minor hand shake causes the crusty dip
to get on the tip of his nose

ALEX’S POV
Mrs Connelly looms over him selling

MRS CONNELLY
It’s French onion

Alex swallows and smiles Mrs Connelly sits down on the
couch too close to Nancy She pats her knees happily

MRS CONNELLY
There

NANCY
How are you feeling Josie

MRS CONNELLY
Why do you ask dear

NANCY
Because the last time we saw you
you were quite ill

MRS CONNELLY
Oh I had a bit of a cold I’m in
fine fettle now But tell me about
yourselves What do you do Alan

ALEX
Alex

NANCY
Alex is writing a novel

MRS CONNELLY
Well Now I never thought of it
but that is a job in a way
(turns to Nancy)
So I suppose you must have to work
then

NANCY
Alexs already had one novel
published In hardback It was
called “Unbodied Souls”

Mrs Connelly looks confused
Doyle Draft 011502 19

ALEX
(just being helpful)
It’s from a John Donne poem

MRS CONNELLY
I think it was “souls unbodied” in
that poem dear

ALEX
(smiling politely)
You might be right

MRS CONNELLY
I am dear Oh let me refill that
for you

Mrs Connelly pours another inch into Alex’s empty glass

MRS CONNELLY
(mostly to Nancy)
Mr Connelly had the taste too
The drink took him from me in 1959
We had been married forty years

Nancy and Alex are doing the math in their heads Mrs
Connelly breaks the silence

MRS CONNELLY
So now tell me when might you be
having children

Alex finds this question a little forward Nancy does not

NANCY
Soon

ALEX
In the next few years

NANCY
Weve talked about two years

ALEX
Depending On economic conditions
and other considerations

MRS CONNELLY
You sound just like Mr Connelly
We never did have children And now
its too late for me
Doyle Draft 011502 20

Alex reaches for his wine glass We hear a WATERY PLOP Alex
looks over and sees Mr Fawkes’ tail feathers hanging over
his glass He pulls his hand away uneasily

NANCY
(genuinely concerned)
So Josie you don’t have any
family

MRS CONNELLY
They’ve all gone on to their
reward please God

Nancy puts her hand over Mrs Connelly’s hands

NANCY
I’m sure they have

MRS CONNELLY
When you live long as I have you
see so many deaths Me mammy and me
daddy went oh it was back in the
Great Consumption

Alex glances at a clock built into a Pieta reproduction It
reads 715 pm The face MATCH DISSOLVES to 837

MRS CONNELLY (0C)

We lost Uncle Dennis and little
Nuala in the influenza outbreak of
1918

The clock face MATCH DISSOLVES to 1024
Mrs Connelly sits between a stupefied Alex and Nancy

MRS CONNELLY
I did have one sister Lily But
she died horribly

NANCY
I am so sorry

MRS CONNELLY
Ah well it’s the Irish way
(noticing)
Look I’ve kept you up I’m sorry
I didn’t notice the time Let me
show you out

Mrs Connelly stands to lead them out As Alex rises a RUDE
NOISE emanates from his chair Nancy looks at him askance
Doyle Draft 011502 21

ALEX
It was the chair

Nancy gives hima “let’s just drop it” look Instead Alex
turns back to the chair and pumps it with his hand trying to
get it to recreate the sound He turns back to Nancy

ALEX
(under breath urgent)
It was the chair

Nancy is suddenly hit by a ripe eye-watering odor It hits
Alex a moment later

ALEX
(desperate sotto to
Nancy )

That wasn’t me

ON MRS CONNELLY

She smiles serenely

INT APARTMENT — BEDROOM — NIGHT

Nancy sits in bed with a pad and pencil Alex in T-shirt and
underpants walks in reading a dictionary He steps on the

SQUEAKY FLOORBOARD but ignores it

ALEX
A macaw is a parrot

He SLAPS the book closed with satisfaction and gets into bed
Nancy is figuring something on her pad

NANCY
She’s between 95 and 105 years old
(looks around gets idea)
Ooo Turn out your light

A little puzzled Alex turns out his light So does Nancy
Their faces are bathed in a flickering glow

THEIR POV
A tiny blaze burns in the fireplace Soft street light
filters in the room seems even more majestic than in broad

daylight Nancy suppresses a squeal

NANCY
We’re millionaires

lie down KISSING

Ten people have moved out of here

MRS CONNELLY
Well they didn’t all move out Mr
Myer took his own life Poor dear

Alex is preoccupied with something he sees at the bottom of
Mr Fawkes’ cage

ALEX
Is that my novel

It is Torn-out pages covered with birdshit

MRS CONNELLY

I’m sorry dear I couldn’t read
it It was filthy dirty

Mrs Connelly is turning red She’s CHOKING

Alex jumps up and hoists Mrs Connelly out of her chair He
Heimlich’s her violently several times The chocolate flies
out Relieved Alex relaxes his grip Mrs Connelly instantly
drops out of frame We hear a DEAD THUMP

Nancy drops to Mrs Connelly’s side feels her neck pulse

seen on TV

Nancy pushes Alex away and starts doing real CPR Alex looks
on helplessly

Alex anxiously sticks his finger in Mrs Connelly mouth and
scoops out a fingerful of gooey chocolate

NANCY (CONT )
Give her mouth-to-mouth

Alex is terrified But dutifully he opens Mrs Connelly
mouth and blows in He comes up for breath starts to blow
again Mrs Connelly eyes snap open He backs off startled

MRS CONNELLY
What are you doing

She looks down Nancy’s hands are on Mrs Connelly’s breasts

NANCY
You choked on chocolate

Flustered Mrs Connelly pushes them away and starts to
stand She recoils from Alex’s attempt to help her up

Technically she’s already dead

They walk in front of the playground Nancy stops to watch

ALEX

Nancy hugs Alex He hugs her back and kisses her forehead
They watch the children play

EXT EAST VILLAGE — LATE AFTERNOON

A tiny blacked-out storefront with “ANARCHY” sloppily painted
in red across the window Alex acting as suspicious as
possible exits with a bag full of books He’s wearing a
hooded sweatshirt and sunglasses — the Unabomber Disguise

INT APARTMENT — BEDROOM — SATURDAY AFTERNOON

Sun streams in the window We PAN over to the bed where we

see the titles of several pamphlets and books with type-only
covers “Art of the Kill” “Amateur Assassination” “50 Ways
to Off Your Lover” “Clean Kills” etc

Nancy and Alex lazily lie on the bed their legs overlapping
flipping through the books and trading them as if they were
reading the Sunday New York Times together

Music “ILL BE GLAD WHEN YOU’RE DEAD (YOU RASCAL YOU)” BY
LOUIS ARMSTRONG

ALEX
How about this

He hands her the book (The title is simply “KILL YOUR
ENEMIES”) Nancy scrunches up her face in disgust

NANCY
Too messy
(been on her mind)
Alex what about Officer Dan
Doyle Draft 011502 82

ALEX
I think we’re smarter than Officer
Dan

We hear the BRASS ENSEMBLE from above Nancy and Alex smile
at each other and cozy closer together

INT BROWNSTONE — SECOND FLOOR LANDING — THE NEXT DAY

Nancy and Alex sit on the stairs in crouched positions
Wearing yellow rubber gloves they rapidly twist banisters
back and forth They’re both hopped up on adrenaline

NANCY
She’s gone to the pharmacy so
weve got two hours

ALEX
The pharmacy is two blocks away

NANCY
She likes to recount the pills

Alex twists a banister and it moves easily

ALEX
These are loose

NANCY
(diligently twisting)
I noticed it when I was tacking
down the carpet I’m surprised she
hasn’t noticed it

ALEX
It’s her own fault then

Nancy stands and backs up against Mrs Connelly’s door

NANCY
(miming it as she speaks)
Okay Pitter-pats out holds on for
support ancient railing collapses
over she goes Aaaahhh Tragic One
paragraph in the New York Post

Alex stands and puts his arm around Nancy’s waist

ALEX
Youre sexy when you’re evil

They kiss As they do so the handrail starts to move not
out but parallel with the stairs
Doyle Draft 011502 83

The couple glances over just as the banisters start to
collapse like dominos gathering speed as they round the
corner The final banisters bounce wildly on the wood
flooring Two bounce up and SMASH into the stained glass
Nancy stifles a SCREAM Alex is dumbstruck

EXT BROWNSTONE — MORNING

Go go go

Alex runs out in black jeans turtleneck and gloves and
scurries up the stairs (which has been rebuilt probably at
some expense with lots of clamps still in place where the
stained glass was is covered with a black plastic tarp)
Nancy does a quick recon and runs up the stairs after him

The two “break” and scurry in different directions We follow
Alex as he scampers about the parlor looking for dangers he
can create He hops around commando-style

INT MRS CONNELLY’S APARTMENT — BATHROOM

Nancy runs in and scans quickly Seeing that the new tiles in
the shower don’t match the old ones she gets briefly
heartsick Then remembering her mission she starts going
through all the bottles around Mrs Connelly’s sink and on
top of her toilet tank It’s mostly beauty products Nancy
picks up a large jar of face cream

NANCY
Chanel I can’t even afford Chanel

Nancy opens the medicine cabinet there are dozens of
prescription bottles inside

NANCY

Jackpot

IN THE PARLOR

Alex fiddles with the brackets holding a very large heavy
bronze crucifix hanging from the wall The crucifix drops
down and BANGS him on the head very very hard

IN THE BATHROOM
Nancy swaps medications in bottles as quickly as possible

NANCY
Little white pills in with other
little white pills tragic mix-up

She puts the medicine back in the cabinet She looks in the
shower grabs a bottle of shampoo She starts squirting some
on the bottom of the tub

NANCY
So many accidents occur in the

Holding the sides of his face Nancy bends Alex’s head down
and licks the blood off his forehead He kisses her She
kisses him back They start to make out Then she sees

Perched on an upper cornice is Mr Fawkes staring down at
them like the Raven

Alex waves to the baby She GIGGLES Alex comes up close to
the baby and makes silly faces and FUNNY NOISES The baby
SHRIEKS IN TERROR

Suddenly the baby’s mother appears and sweeps the baby away

Nancy is looking up at the hole in the ceiling

NANCY
You know as long as we’re putting
a hole in the ceiling this might
be a better place for a staircase
We could turn the two front rooms
into a split level living-slash-
entertainment area

Sure

Alex exits Nancy doesn’t really notice

Alex returns lugging the wooden pyramid He places it right
under the ceiling hole

Or you could come back in the

use poison-tipped umbrellas

He mimes poking Mrs Connelly in the back with a poison-
tipped umbrella Nancy appears and starts rearranging the
ornaments Alex has already placed on the tree

NANCY
They used some kind of special
superdeadly poison

ALEX
(miming)
We could just poke her a bunch of
times with regular poison

They both CHUCKLE a little evilly
After a beat
NANCY
You know Alex I think we’re being

too smart for own good

ALEX
Smart

Nancy reaches into a box and takes out a beautiful angel
NANCY
We’re making everything overly
complicated Maybe it should just
be something simple

ALEX
Push her down the stairs you mean

Alex lifts Nancy so she can place the angel atop the tree

fine Cash right

counts out almost all of his money and hands it over

EXT TIMES SQUARE — SEVERAL NIGHTS LATER

Alex a little hunched over and Nancy limping to keep up
walk through bright sanitized Times Square And yet the
tableau is strongly reminiscent of “Midnight Cowboy”

MUSIC “SILVER BELLS” BY TOM WAITS
INT NONDESCRIPT MEETING ROOM — MIDTOWN SOMEWHERE
Alex takes a seat on a folding chair next to a BIG GUY

At the front of the room is a podium with a banner behind it
which reads “Men Accepting Non-Voluntary Genital Loss” a
MEMBER is speaking

MEMBER
Well a lot of you are asking what
kind of idiot would rest an idling
chain saw in his lap
(raises hand sheepishly)
Guilty

BACK OF THE ROOM
The Big Guy wearing a MANGL button turns to Alex

BIG GUY

BIG GUY

FRANK

have chosen one does not sexually
pleasure one’s bosses’ mistress

ALEX
(without looking at him)
My wife shot me in the dick

FRANK
(turns to look ahead)
At least you didn’t have to eat

Alex puts it all together He gets an idea

ALEX
Say Frank in this profession you
have chosen do you freelance

Music “SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN” BY FRANK SINATRA

Alex and Nancy are huddled in a booth with Frank Nancy’s
titanium Powerbook sits between them

ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN

Using Nancy’s CGI design program we enter Mrs Connelly’s
apartment and turn toward the parlor

NANCY (0C)
The door will be unlocked Once you

to go for a much cleaner brighter
look For starters those drapes

NANCY (0C)
(Back to business)
You might find her here

The computer’s camera swivels toward Mrs Connelly chair
which has a virtual little old lady sitting it

NANCY
Or she might be in her bedroom

Frank who doesn’t look like he has got that nods

FRANK
When do you want this done

ALEX
As soon as possible
NANCY
Tonight
FRANK

Tonight’s Christmas Eve I like to
spend Christmas Eve with my family

ALEX
It’s Christmas Eve

go to bed
Alex and Nancy nod their heads That sounds good
EXT BROWNSTONE — CHRISTMAS EVE — EARLY EVENING

INT BROWNSTONE — SECOND FLOOR LANDING
Mrs Connelly wears a Santa hat

MRS CONNELLY
I hope you won’t be mad Officer
Dan told me to buy a new TV and
give you the bill but when I
ordered it I didn’t realize it was
so expensive

They look into Mrs Connelly apartment It’s a gigantic flat
screen cinema aspect-ratio HDTV plasma monitor

MRS CONNELLY
It gets a much better picture than
my old TV And it has a sleep
timer so if I fall asleep watching
it it’ll turn itself off

ALEX
That’s great

Mrs Connelly hands her the bill

MRS CONNELLY
They said they have easy financing

NANCY
(big smile)
Enjoy your new TV Mrs Connelly

EXT BROWNSTONE — CHRISTMAS EVE — NIGHT
MUSIC “OH HOLY NIGHT” BY MAZZY STAR
INT APARTMENT — BEDROOM— CONTINUOUS
Nancy and Alex sit in the dark for a long beat
NANCY
I never thought of myself as the
kind of person who would hire an

assassin to kill a little old lady

Another beat

ALEX
I feel bad about myself
Doyle Draft 011502 106

They sit there contemplating what they’ve become Suddenly
we hear a LOUD CRASHING OC Alex and Nancy leap out of bed

INT APARTMENT — PARLOR

Alex rushes in and reaches for a light switch A crowbar
SMASHES his hand He SCREAMS

In the light we see Frank shielding his eyes with the
crowbar-wielding hand He backs up and falls into the
Christmas tree CRASHING with it to the ground He thrashes
around in a sea of ELECTRICAL SPARKS

NANCY
(screams )
What are you doing

Frank struggles to the ground He looks sheepish and
obviously drunk

FRANK
(drunk)
You said second floor I climbed

up
He points to the broken window he came through

ALEX
This is the first floor You
climbed up from the basement floor

Frank hits himself on the forehead

FRANK
Stupid Frank
(defensive)
I had a couple of drinks okay
Have you ever killed anyone It’s

hard

ALEX
Look Frank maybe we should
just

Nancy smells smoke She and Alex look over to see the tree is
BURNING Then Nancy’s pine cone garlands catch on fire and
the fire ZIPS along them like a fuse ringing the whole
apartment with fire

Nancy and Alex are frozen in stunned silence for a moment
Then they hear SOMETHING They turn to see

Frank is stumbling out their front door toward the stairs
Doyle Draft 011502 107

INT BROWNSTONE — LOBBY
Alex and Nancy run out just in time to see

Frank bounds to the top of the stairs He rips open Mrs
Connelly’s door with the crowbar He rushes in Nancy and
Alex watch in horror as they hear

MRS CONNELLY
(SCREAM)

Frank staggers back out of the door Mrs Connelly wrapped
around his head like an ATTACKING BABOON She strikes him on
the head with a huge brass crucifix He falls against the
railing which COLLAPSES They plunge together over the side

Nancy and Alex rush up Bob eyes are wide open He’s dead
Then he blinks He struggles to his feet and staggers out

Alex stares down at the injured Mrs Connelly On her
forearm written in blue are a series of numbers

ALEX
Hitler couldn’t kill her What
chance do I have

Nancy looks down She bends over licks a finger and rubs it
on the numbers They smear off

NANCY
That’s the number of the Park Slope
police department

Alex and Nancy huddle together and look down at the
unconscious Mrs Connelly Then back at the fire engulfing
their home Then back at Mrs Connelly

NANCY
We could just leave her here

ALEX
But we won’t

NANCY
(sadly)
Well never be rich
Alex turns to kiss Nancy on the forehead and sees

THEIR DOORWAY

Dozens of mice scurry out escaping the fire This scares
them but not as much as when they turn back to see
Doyle Draft 011502 108

IN THE LOBBY

A dark figure rises in front of the black plastic tarp which
burns away at that moment revealing the inferno in their
bedroom The figure is Mrs Connelly A SCREECH is heard
Mr Fawkes swoops down and lands on Mrs Connelly shoulder
Seen only in silhouette she looks like some kind of pirate

ON ALEX AND NANCY

Their moment of truth

EXT BROWNSTONE — A MOMENT LATER

Nancy opens the door Alex carries Mrs Connelly out in his
arms We PULL OUT and UP as they hobble down the stairs Once
they get to the sidewalk

NANCY
Where do we go now

WE CONTINUE PULLING OUT Alex points in one direction and
they start going that way After a few steps Nancy stops and
points in the opposite direction They go that way

Music “WELCOME CHRISTMAS” (THE WHOVILLE SONG) BY LOVE

INT APARTMENT — LIBRARY — CONTINUOUS

Kenneth leads another young couple through the apartment
It’s battered (and a lot of glass is missing) but it’s still
mighty impressive

MRS CONNELLY
Are you looking at the apartment

Officer Dan smiles betraying nothing
CLOSE ON

Their wedding photo in front of their fireplace etc PULL
OUT to reveal we are

INT STATE WOMEN’S PRISON — NANCY’S CELL — DAY

Nancy is walking around the cell trying to demonstrate what
she’s talking about

NANCY
I’m just saying the whole thing is
a little boxy But if we angle the
bed a little it’ll make a kind of
“conversation pit” with the toilet
which we should get some sort of
pretty fabric to drape over it

Nancy’s cellmate who’s killed before is unconvinced

NANCY’S CELLMATE
No

NANCY
Look if we’re going to be roomies
for the next twelve to eighteen
months

INT STATE MEN’S PRISON — ALEX’S CELL — DAY

INT BROWNSTONE — LOBBY

The young couple watches as Mrs Connelly slowly makes her
way toward the stairs and stops

MRS CONNELLY
Oh these stairs will be the death
of me If only I had one of those
elevator chairs that carry you up

WIFE
That would be nice but

HUSBAND
(patronizing)
I imagine they’re quite expensive

MRS CONNELLY
Yes I suppose you are right

With Officer’s Dan’s help she makes it up the first step
The couple share a knowing glance

CLOSE ON

Officer’s Dans pocket Sticking out is a pamphlet “American
