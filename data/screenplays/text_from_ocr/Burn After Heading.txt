9 EXT YACHTAT SEA - DAY
THE BRIDGE

A small yacht Osbourne stands at the wheel a light wind in
his face as the boat sails under motor power

After a beat he moves to the front of the boat

An old man sits on a bench on the prow facing out into the
wind He has snowy hair and a stern Yankee face He wears a
tweed cap He doesnt much react to Osbournes approach

OSBOURNE
You okay there Dad

The old man remains silent staring Osbourne sits next to
him and idly tucks in the plaid blanket resting over the
mans knees

OSBOURNE (CONTD)
Dad I left my job at the
Agency

The old man stares out into the wind

OSBOURNE (CONTD)

I uh Im sorry Dad
government service is not what it was
when you were in State Things are
different now I dont know maybe
its its the Cold War ending
now it seems like its all bureaucracy
and no mission
The old man stares out into the wind

OSBOURNE (CONTD)

Im writing a memoir I think
its going to be pretty explosive
But I dont think youll disapprove
I dont think youll disapprove
Katie has had trouble accepting it

OSBOURNE (CONTD)

out He will reform But If not
forewarned is forearmed

12 INT COX HOUSE - DAY

Osbourne is splayed on an easy chair wearing a bathrobe over
pyjamas He stares at the ceiling motionless arms out-
flung like Marat in his bathtub

A long still beat A clock ticks

Abruptly Osbourne raises one hand to speak into a
microcassette recorder

OSBOURNE
We were young and committed and there
was nothing we couldnt do We

thought of the Agency less as less
as
The thought such as it was peters out Osbourne rises and

wanders around the room glassy-eyed
He suddenly raises the microcassette again

OSBOURNE (CONTD)

The principles of George Kennan----a
personal hero of mine----were what
animated us In fact they were what
had originally inspired me to enter
government service Like the State

Departments China Hands of yore or
in a different forum in a different
venue in a different medium in

um Murrows Boys the fabled----in
a different----

He suddenly stops head cocked listening

Faintly a ringing phone

stairway He inclines his head to clear the ceiling that
juts over the bottom half of the stairwell

The phone is louder here

dropped ceiling of water-stained Johnson-Armstrong tile The
ringing phone is on a cheap government-surplus desk The
answering machine with Osbournes voice picks up

feet toward the phone

OSBOURNE
Shoulders twisting as we hear ice clattering out of a tray

He pours coke sizzling onto the ice

He pauses for a long beat
He takes a bottle of rum out of a cabinet
He pours some into a hatch-marked shot glass
He looks at it The amber liquid tops the hatch mark He

conscientiously pours the overage back murmuring

OSBOURNE
Single

He dumps the shot into the Coke

EXT SAILBOAT - DUSK

As before the boat docked at the end of the marina pier is

a couple having sex When it builds to climax we cut

sits She cracks open a CD case and loads the CD into
Osbournes computer A suspense drone builds as we track in

listening for noises in the house Nothing She resumes
typing

We hear male voices beginning to swell in song The voices

continue after the suspense drone snaps off at the cut to

INT FENNINGERS - NIGHT

holds it aloft waggling it for Krapotkin

Krapotkin stares

After a beat of looking at the proffered diskette Krapotkin
leans forward to take it Linda smiles Krapotkin turns the

diskette over a couple of times looks sadly up

KRAPOTKIN

A car is pulling into the driveway Katie Cox emerges from
the drivers side

Reverse shows Chad in his suit watching from a parked car
across the street

Now Harry Pfarrer emerges from the passenger side wearing a
brown pin-striped suit Encumbered by something bulky he
follows Katie up the walk

It seems to be some kind of pillow or cushion under his arm
but very large and wedge-shaped Katie is letting herself
in Harry gives a furtive glance around----as Chad sinks back
in his car seat----before entering with the wedge-cushion

The door closes

He notices

Another car parked on the same side of the street further
up Someone is just straightening from a slouch to become
visible over the drivers headrest

Chad looks puzzled

door but pauses seeing

The parked car up the street Katies car having passed it
now pulls out and follows at a discreet distance Both cars
disappear

Chad opens his door and gets out He is crossing to the
townhouse when he notices another car parked on the other

Chad relaxes straightens up A beat He looks idly around

side of the street A man sits in the drivers seat
smoking

level door tucked under the stoop Chad checks out the

106 INT COX TOWNHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Chad hotfoots into a closet and eases its door most of the
way shut The footsteps mount the stairs Chad peeks out

His POV The bed bedclothes rumpled In the middle of the
bed a wedge-cushion

Beyond the open bedroom door shows a slice of hallway and
stairs Harry arrives at the top of the stairs He nudges
back a drape on the window at the top of the steps He looks
down one way then the other He lets the drape fall back
and seems to relax

Harry enters the bedroom He strips off his shirt and steps
out of his pants on his way into the bathroom off the master
bedroom He leaves the door open

Chad reaches gingerly for the closet door to close it but
stops abruptly as we hear the shower turned off and the
curtain whipped back Harry emerges from the shower He
rinses off humming Born Free and walks into the
foreground pulling on shorts and shirt and a pair of dress
pants that was draped across a bureau

Chad shrinks back into the closet as Harry approaches Harry
stops just outside the cracked door

Through the crack we see only the white of his shirt
Abruptly Harry turns his back to us and recedes into the room
and bends to pick something off the floor

Chad leans in ever so slightly to see but draws back again
as Harry approaches

Chad looks over to his right on a hanger the brown
pinstripe coat that matches Harrys pants

The closet door is thrown open

CHAD
Nuhhh

HARRY
AHHHHHHHHHH

Harry jerks up the gun which hes pulled from the shoulder
holster in his other hand and----BAM----shoots Chad in the face
The gun bucks Unused to the recoil and still screaming
Harry staggers back and trips over the edge of the bed and
drops the weapon
He crabs briefly backward and then flips over and scrambles
off on all fours In the hallway he rises and tramples down
the stairs

107 INT COX TOWNHOUSE - BOTTOM OF STAIRS - DAY

Inside his gun lies on the floor
Harry takes cautious steps toward the door
He pauses at the cracked door Suddenly

HARRY

He plunges through the door and runs for the gun and scoops
it dropping the knife

He stands and spins panting
His point-of-view the closet Its door ajar Legs protrude
into the room as if Chad hidden within is sitting with his

back against the closet wall contemplating his next move

Harry walks cautiously over With a bare foot he
experimentally waggles one of Chads feet Limp

Harry nudges the door

Inside are a few dollars and nothing else no credit cards
drivers license empty

HARRY (CONTD)

He leans back in trying not to look but for some reason
feeling obliged to return the wallet

As he opens the suit coat to slip it back in the inside
pocket he notices

The suit label has been cut away He fingers the raveled
fringe

HARRY (CONTD)
Oh my fuck

Hi Sorry to call out of the blue but
I have a well a publishing question
and I thought you might be the person
to ask I have this manuscript
something to do with my professional
experiences not to go into too much
detail but I think its pretty
explosive stuff and I think that it
could merit a fairly wide readership
handled properly and it isnt quite
finished yet but theres a situation
where Im worried about it leaking now
and maybe excerpts being published or
on the internet whatever without my
permission anda lot of the impact
being um blunted so Im actually
anxious to bring it to market sooner
than Id planned----I mean like now in
fact----so I was thinking I know you

and you seem to do well so I was
wondering if you were happy with your
publisher The people you use

A long beat

arm Or isnt it uh the childrens
