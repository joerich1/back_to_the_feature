wanted for attacks throughout
Moscow earlier in the day

We see security footage of Vladimir Toye sneaking down the
hallway with a bag strung over his shoulder sliding inside
the familiar room where the bomb was rigged

A remote control comes into frame A thumb hits the mute key
then releases the controller It hits the floor with a THUMP
We hear a voice (MOUSE)

MOUSE (0S)
So like I was saying it’s all
about the main character - the guy
with the gun He is going to
determine how the whole thing pans
out

And we PULL OUT to find that this is one of many televisions
in the room - news channels (MSNBC FOX CNN) play on all of
them save for one On that 72” behemoth we find a videogame
titled Massive Destruction (similar to Call of Dut in
progress

On that screen we see a digital soldier in an urban war-zone
combating a mass of enemies He sprints through the city-
scape dodging gunfire

ANGLE ON GAMER - late 20s wiry and pale working the
controller like a magician This is our hero ADAM MOUSE

takes the beer and sips

Mouse digs in his pocket throws some money down and the
little blue pill drops onto the bar He picks it up stares
at it then turns his attention toward the line of TV’s
above He focuses on one in particular

BILL O’REILLY reports over war-footage then cuts to a shot
of SENATOR LAMBERT (a likeable enough chum) on the campaign
trail

BILL O’REILLY
But is it another Vietnam Senator
Lambert seems to think so He’s set
to pledge a removal of all troops
when he accepts the Democratic
nomination in Los Angeles this
weekend

A voice (PRIEST) chimes in a few seats down
PRIEST (0S)
Senator Lambert is proving to be
quite the trailblazer isn’t he
Mouse glances over The man immaculately dressed 50 in
vampire years - as if centuries were witnessed through those
brown-marble eyes - stares back This is THOMAS PRIEST

Mouse shrugs He pops his pill chases it with the beer
PRIEST (CONT’D)
Not a man for politics I presume
I wish I were the same way but I
can’t help being marvelled by the
dissonance It is such great
theatre

Mouse turns to him

MOUSE
Sorry man but I’m supposed to be
meeting somebody any minute now

PRIEST

Id like you to meet Miss Evelyn

MOUSE

It was for me I told you things

EVELYN
I’m sorry Mouse

MOUSE
Well you got me here Proceed
Miss Lewis

Evelyn shakes off the conversation and moves toward the
equipment

EVELYN
The simulation runs on the same
principles as the first-person
shooter games There are two
levels Each level contains a
target The Los Angeles Federal
Building

Evelyn brings up an image of the Federal Building then
clicks to an image of The Library Tower - the tallest
building in the LA skyline

EVELYN (CONT’D)
-and the Library Tower in the
heart of downtown Los Angeles

MOUSE
Why those buildings

PRIEST
Intelligence suggests that attacks
on these locations are imminent
Your game will help us improve
their security
(to Evelyn)
Please continue

EVELYN

We’ve constructed them perfectly
Everything in the game is
consistent with reality down to
the faces of the guards

(off photo)
To pass level one you must
penetrate the Federal Building
access the law enforcement security
protocols inside their database
then destroy the computer and the
building with it You’1l need those
protocols to pass level two

MOUSE
And how do I pass level two

EVELYN
Destroy the building

MOUSE
Two buildings Sounds pretty easy

EVELYN
I assure you it won’t be Nobody -
not Mr Priest nor myself - have
been able to pass the game

MOUSE
Well that’s why I’m here I guess

EVELYN
That’s right We’re about to find
out if you’re as good as you think
you are

Orci runs a laser scanner over his face copying the contours
down to the pore

It uploads on the screen in front of PRIEST who watches
nearby Next to him EVELYN types coordinating the cameras
and projectors

Mouse looks down at the rubber floor - a massive treadmill
that runs on 360-degree rotors to simulate movement in all
directions while keeping the subject still

Finally Orci puts a pair of headphones over Mouse’s ears and
a visor over his eyes He retreats off the stage leaving
Mouse alone in dark silence

PRIEST
