napkin in for him decanting the wine--He props a golden

Deeply moved Hook pulls the gun from his mouth--pondering
the question before hin

HOOK
Good form Smee What would the
world be without Capt Hook

The eternal question He clutches Smee in an endearing
hug--unaware he’s clawing Smee’s back Suddenly paranoid
listening he releases Smee--who’s in severe pain

HOOK
What’s that ticking

He slashes his drapes with his sword--slicing Cecco--

HOOK
Where is it Tick-tick-tick There

Hook crawls on-hands and knees frantic looking under the
table He’s up inspecting the food running his sword out a
series of portholes slashing his chaise--

SMEE

all the clocks overboard--remember

Hook grabs an hour glass-listening to see if it’s ticking
He smashes it Hooking Smee under the collar he lifts
the bulbous man ins the air

HOOK
(ever so polite)
Are you saying--there is no ticking
in this room Hmmm That I am shall
we say mentally unstable because J

your gist Mr Smee

Smee motions frantically to Cecco--who is sitting on the
floor near faint from his sword wound

Crushed with rejection Hook grabs his second pistol and
shoves it in his mouth again Smee pulls it out--

revenge Pan’s kids in love with Hook
The ultimate pay back Cap’n

Hook relaxes his trigger finger piqued
