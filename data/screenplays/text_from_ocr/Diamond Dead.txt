EXT FACTORY RUINS - NIGHT 1

Whiffs of fog drift across the darkness as the moon emerges
from behind the clouds illuminating crumbling cement blocks
and twisted steel overgrown by weeds ARIA DE WINTER dressed
as a goth girl climbs over the cement blocks carrying a
bouquet of roses She is in her mid forties her face is care
worn The years have not been kind to her She lays the roses
on the ground and steps back

ARIA
I miss you guys My life has been a
fucked up mess without you This
whole thing isnt fair

ARIA sits down among the rubble thinking to herself Behind
her an IMPOSING APPARITION pulls itself from the swirling
fog It glides silently over the debris growing more solid as
it advances It silently glides up behind ARIA When it
raises its head it is some kind of long dead alien
monstrosity It is DEATH

DEATH
I say I say Strange place for
flowers

She doesnt bother to look up

ARIA
I suppose

DEATH
I say I wonder if you can help
maam Direction-wise that is

ARIA turns around but doesnt seem to be bothered by the
APPARITION

DEATH
I say Im looking for souls Four
long-haired hippie types Look like
girls on the wrong end of the ugly
stick

ARIA
Huh

DEATH
Stiffs Dirtnappers Corpus
Delectia in the post humus sense
Dig the wax out yer ears maam
Im talkin English aint I
ARIA
Who are you

DEATH
Im a death maam Mortis
Extermis Esq My card

ARIA
A death

DEATH
Thats what I said My mouth is
movin so I must be talkin I say
maam pay attention ya may learn
somethin Lots of people croak
every day Logistically-wise one
death cant handle the load Are
you following me here

ARIA
Sort of

DEATH
The world needs more than one
death

ARIA
So what are you doing here

DEATH
Balancing accounts I have four
souls unaccounted for Its very
unusual for souls to stay under for
that long Theyre like lumpy
gravy They usually float to the
top before the meat goes bad

ARIA
Well theyre down there somewhere

DEATH stares at the ground chagrined

DEATH
Well Baste my butt and call me
vittles I do declare thats more
diggin than a man oughta do in my
condition I give up I needa
break

ARIA
You need a break
DEATH
Who’s gonna give me a break I ask
in mock ignorance and a general air
of foreboding

ARIA
How ‘bout me

DEATH
Why I do declare I think I may
laugh if it didnt jostle my coccyx
so much

ARIA
Why not Beats sittin on my ass
Im a real people person Im
slightly immoral and I temper all
discussions with a nihilistic
anticipation of general disaster

DEATH leans against a tree and a DOZEN BIRDS fall off
branches and hit the ground dead

DEATH
Its an awesome responsibility

ARIA
Sos voting

DEATH
I say I say Theres powers that
go with the title

ARIA
A perk Cool

DEATH
Take this scythe

He hands her his scythe

ARIA
What kind of powers

DEATH
Life and death Forward reverse
CLOSE ON SCYTHE

Theres a switch on the side of the handle that reads
FORWARD AND REVERSE

the
BACK TO SCENE

ARIA
Rad

DEATH
Alright little Miss spooky pants
you have one year Your allotment
is one person a day And on all
Hallows Eve when the clock strikes
the hour of the wolf - that’s
midnight eastern standard time - if
you haven’t met your quota by then
you forfeit your own soul and all
those you love will be erased from
existence

DEATH begins to walk away

DEATH (CONTD)
Have fun Dont kill anyone I
wouldnt kill Knock yourself out
Mortality-wise that is

ARIA
Hey Where ya goin

DEATH
I’m going to get laid Thanks
babe
(to himself)
Nice girl but a little on the
creepy side

DEATH departs The sky blackens with storm clouds Lightning
strikes EXPLODE around ARIA She lowers the scythe to the
ground and hits the reverse switch A BLUE ARC OF ELECTRICITY
EXPLODES from the scythe slashing to the ground The ground
trembles The electricity swirls around ARIA and the years

fall away leaving her decades younger and beautiful

The ground begins to crack we HEAR muffled screams Suddenly
a mummified arm erupts from the earth holding the Diamond
Dead guitar by the neck

EXT GRAND QUIGNOL - NIGHT 2

An old Gothic theater The marquee reads DR DIABOLICUS AND
THE DIAMOND DEAD

INT GRAND QUIGNOL THEATER LOBBY —- NIGHT 3

MATHIAS STARK a nervous and nerdy type in his twenties is
polishing a brass rail on the staircase There is a pounding
on the door MATHIAS opens the door and comes face to face
with TWO SHERIFFS

SHERIFF 1
Mathias Stark

MATHIAS
Yes

SHERIFF 1 hands him some official looking papers MATHIAS
accepts the papers then swats at a moth with them

SHERIFF 1
Pursuant to the order of the court
I am serving you with this
foreclosure notice

MATHIAS
Hey youre making a mistake I got
one more day to get the money

Puzzled SHERIFF 2 leafs through papers on his clipboard

SHERIFF 2
(turns to his partner)
I told ya October has thirty one
days

SHERIFF 1
Well be back

MATHIAS

I don’t think so I got this
fantastic rock act Diamond Dead

poster)

show

They give him a doubtful look and leave
EXT GRAND QUIGNOL - NIGHT 4

The lobby lights turn off then the signs and finally the
marquee lights

A few blocks away FOG rolls in eerily lit with blue light
Inside the fog LIGHTNING FLASHES The THICK FOG rolls past
the theatre as MATHIAS locks the front doors for the night

MATHIAS
Fog Cool

MATHIAS stands in front of the theatre turns around and
looks up at the marquee proudly He shoves his hands in the
pockets of his leather jacket steps backwards and smiles

MATHIAS (CONTD)
I still own a theater Life rocks

The street is deserted and quiet All we HEAR is the BUZZ of
the power lines and the neon in the marquee sign Then
somewhere in the fog MATHIAS hears the sound of souped-up
engines They become louder MATHIAS stares into the fog but
he cant make out anything

High on a pole a transformer EXPLODES sending an electrical
surge down the street A street light EXPLODES and goes dark
and then another and another

MATHIAS (CONTD)
What the hell

A winged wraith like SHAPE streaks past MATHIAS almost
knocking him over Its unearthly feed-back SCREAM ECHOES
down the street MATHIAS turns around but sees nothing

MATHIAS (CONTD)
Holy shit

ARIA
Mathias Stark

MATHIAS turns around ARIA is standing in front of him with a
sinister smile on her face She wears a top hat with a veil
and a black dress

MATHIAS
Yaah

ARIA

MATHIAS
Yes Jesus Christ

ARIA

MATHIAS

ARIA

MATHIAS

with headers fuel injectors and
two inch straight pipes Cuz I do

ARIA

FOUR CUSTOMIZED HEARSES appear out of the fog The DRIVERS
are dressed in nineteenth century livery They stop in front
of the theatre and wait unmoving

MATHIAS
Awesome

ARIA

MATHIAS
Your agent said youd be here

ARIA
It is tomorrow -- three past

MATHIAS

Im sorry I was just going home

A TALL GAUNT MAN steps from one of the hearses and walks up
to ARIA his arms outstretched He holds a scythe on a purple
satin pillow

ARIA
Thank-you Rasputin Ill catch up
later

She takes the scythe The man bows slightly and walks away
ARIA (CONTD)
I bet youre a terribly fascinating
little boy Mathias Kinda sexy in
an innocent sort of white meat way

ARIA twirls the scythe like a baton

ARIA (CONTD)
Would it be alright if we went
inside and started setting up

MATHIAS

The lobby lights TURN THEMSELVES ON then the sign and the
marquee

MATHIAS

street

get a hearse at this time of night

GEENA

A GAUNT FIGURE steps out of the darkness It is DEATH

DEATH
I say I say Hello kiddies

JACK and GEENA start

JACK AND GEENA
Yaah Fuck

DEATH
Up past your bedtime

GEENA
You dick

DEATH
I was kinda hoping I could get your
autograph

DEATH produces a long contract from out of nowhere It
unrolls into the street for about ten feet and then stops
releasing a tiny terrified RAT LIKE CREATURE that was trapped

inside It scurries away into the darkness squeaking in
terror

JACK
Why

GEENA
Yeah What for

DEATH
A trade

GEENA
What kind of trade

DEATH
I give you backstage passes and I
get your immortal soul

GEENA
Damn Jack and I already sold our
souls to Madonna for a couple T-
shirts and a case of beer

Across the street the ROADIES are carrying FOUR COFFINS into
the theatre

ANOTHER ANGLE

ARIA is walking to the theater on the dark street and notices
DEATH with the kids She strides up to them

ARIA
(to Jack and Geena)
Hi guys not to be rude or
anything but I gotta talk to Morty

She gives them two backstage passes

The Marquee suddenly SPARKS UP showering the street and
DEATH ARIA are gone

JACK

GEENA

for a fight

ARIA

DEATH steps backwards and merges with the wall and
disappears ARIA is left to think about Death’s implied
threat

MATHIAS walks to the theatre The street is completely
covered in Diamond Dead posters A huge billboard advertising
the Holy Church of Good Intentions is replaced with the

to his back

MATHIAS rounds the corner and finds the front of his theatre
mobbed with ROCK AND ROLL FANS PROTESTERS TV TRUCKS
POLICE AND T-SHIRT VENDORS

He pushes his way to the front doors fighting off REPORTERS
and SCREAMING DIAMOND DEAD FANS

coffins can be seen against one wall FOUR DARK SILHOUETTES
are sitting on the couch A long bony hand reaches for a
beer sitting on the end table Everybody talks in a whisper

PUSSY
Its very dark in here

ARIA
We like it that way

The band nods in unison A weird distorted chuckle echoes
around the room

PUSSY
I dont think the camera is going
to be able to pick up much in this
light

an espresso

CAMERAMAN
Rolling

PUSSY
(to camera)
This is Pussy A Dangle backstage
with Dr Diabolicus and the
Diamond Dead So guyswhats it
feel like to be stars

DR D
It feels a lot like not being a
star only with a lot more money

PUSSY
So why the darkness Why the
mystery

SPYDER SYN raises TWO SOCK PUPPETS on his hands which do his
speaking for him One is cute the other is distinctly evil
He wears an iron mask and a long cape that conceals his
emaciated anatomy His hair which sticks out of the top of
his mask is parted in the middle One side is dyed white
the other black

SPYDER SYN - GOOD PUPPET
We shun the light Our eyes and our
souls are attuned to the darkness

GLITTER is a tall mummified cadaver made up like a French
whore His once outlandish glitz wardrobe hangs on him like a
scarecrow

GLITTER
Sunlight dries our skin We all
have very sensitive skin

DR D
We dont go near water either

PUSSY
Why

SPYDER SYN - GOOD PUPPET
We dont want to re-hydrate

DR D

paradox disguised as philosophy

sensual sense of spontaneity and
in fact hampers positive primal
instinct

Suddenly theres a BLINDING FLASH and ARIA appears standing
on a tomb with guitar in hand She strikes an open chord and

hundreds of guns fire at once The gun battle goes on for a
full twenty seconds before the shooting finally ceases and
the lights come back up Everyone in the auditorium lies
dead The music changes to a slow eerie dirge like tune Fog
rolls into the house In its center DEATH glides in

The CLOCK on the marble tomb begins to chime midnight

She raises up her scythe hits the reverse switch and twirls
it over her head Lightning FLASHES in arcs from the stage to
points in the house and to the balcony Lights EXPLODE The
breakers fail and the theatre is thrown into an eerie light
as the slain audience’s bodies begin to twitch and convulse

with new life

DEATH swats MATHIAS out of the way and MATHIAS is airborne
crashing into the amp stack D BANGZ and SPYDER attack DEATH
to little effect He knocks them aside as easily as he did

ARIA swings the scythe with both arms and throws it at DEATH
It spins through the air as if in slow motion It shears off
DEATH’s head cleanly and buries itself in the proscenium
arch

Aria’s guitar and he DrD’s microphone They also sport
bullet holes in their bodies

the high end

The whole death trip has been a
little overplayed

JACK
Sorry Pussy but the Diamond Dead

in the belly

JACK

The Grand Quignol EXPLODES in a fire ball Aria’s scythe
flies through the air disappearing into the night sky

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY 95

The scythe falls from the sky embedding its blade in the
blacktop of the road A breeze blows dust past On the wind
is distant music ARIA’S hand reaches down and pulls the
scythe from the blacktop ARIA and MATHIAS stand on the
shoulder of the road having just stepped out of Mathias

EXT HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER 97

ARIA begins to walk down the road her scythe over her
shoulder and a head-shaped bundle wrapped in butcher’s paper
in her hand

A CAR speeds past her and then slams on its brakes It is a

57 CADILLAC HEARSE ARIA smiles and gets in The HEARSE
roars its engine and takes off for the vanishing point

EXT MATHIAS’ CAR — MOMENTS LATER 98

MATHIAS slams on his brakes and power slides 180 degrees And
roars after the hearse
