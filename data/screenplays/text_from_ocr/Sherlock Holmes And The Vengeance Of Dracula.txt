TITLE - LONDON 1891
EXT DOCKS - EVENING

A desolate night heavy with ghostly fog and tomblike silence
A rusty STEAMSHIP is docked at a deserted London pier

BR swarthy Italian CAPTAIN and A RUSSIAN with a shaccy goatee haul
AN OBLONG CRATE down the wooden gangplank from the boat

The Russian is named WOJCEK and the thick lenses in his wire-fran
spectacles magnify his beady eyes to a grotesque degree

The two men grunt as they lower the crate onto firm ground

WOJCEK
Be careful you dolt Your
primitive brain has no conception
how precious this treasure is

Two slovenly ruffians named DAWSON and BIXBY emerge from the
Garkness to greet Wojcek and the Captain with cocked pistols

BIXBY
Well just see for ourselves
then mate The Professors
waitin’ on hot coals for this’n

CAPTAIN
You lads are late

DAWSON
sneering at Wojcek)
Whew Been hittin’ the pipe now
eh ya Goper I kin smell the
peppy on yer breath from ‘ere

WOJCEK
to the Captain)
Swine You dare to betray me
Eixky and Dawson iencre his protests as they pry the top off the
crate -- anc gasp with surprise at its contents

CAPTAIN
All this hush-hush sneakin’
to smuggle in a damned body

He spits scornfully on the coffin kicking it with his boot

UTTERING NOISE from above causes him to glance up --
AT swoops down from the dark and attacks the Captain’s neck
eature clamps down viciously with razor fangs

CAPTAIN
Aagh Get this night rat off me

Bs the Captain wrestles with the frenzied bat at his throat
a SECOND BAT joins the attack then ANOTHER BAT and still more
others -- a shrieking torrent of leathery wings --
Tne thugs Bixby and Dawson back away in horror transfixed by the
grisiiest sight either man has ever seen

hswarm of onashinog bats cover i
The Captain flails in agony as he is lifted bodily off the ground
by the threbbing flapping mass of winged rodents

he coffin tid slowly creeks cpen

Dawson gapes slack-jawed as

DAWSON
Lord save us --

WOJCEK
(giggles ecstatically)
The Overlord awakens

Dawson and Bixby whirl to run wildly without locking back
The two thugs flee through the dark alleyways --

as some UNSEEN SNARLING CREATURE rapidly pursues them

Bixby dares a look behind him and terror squeezes his hear
The SILHOUETTE of a fierce BEAST with BLAZING CRIMSON EYES
is dimly outlined through the fog as it loves nearer

Bixby trembles as he FIRES his revolver into the mist --
but impossibly the animal is gone Vanished Eerie silence
and fog envelope the two thuas chilling them both to the bene

Both Bixby and Dawson turn to peer uneasily into the swirling
vapors obscuring the alleyway before them --

hen A HUGE FEROCIOUS WOLF
fur and teeth lunges savagel

xplodes out of the fog The mass cf
at Binbys throat

Bixby screams as he is ripp t by the animal Dawscn boits ier
I life Glancing back at omed partner he is stunned to see
not a wolf crouched over Bixbys blioodied body --

A ox FOuD of men march along a decorated hallway of
Mas Assorted exotic curios line the walls -- suit
Bivican masks framed paintings antique sculptures

suseum Director is a blustery muttonchopped milit
NEL SMYTHE who wears a gold MONOCLE in one eye
ety assistant is SULLIVAN

Both men are being questioned by a ferrec-faced INSPECTOR LESTRALE
SMYTHE
The ransom note was explicit --
either the British Museum
pays fifty thousand pounds
by” mignight tomorrow or the
Ling Tau Tapestry will be destroy
Ourrageous intolerable

LS
LESTRADE
And you have no idea how it
was smuggled out of the Museum

SULLIVAN
None whatsoever The Tapestry
measures over four by five meters
It was a gift from the Chinese ambassador

LESTRADE
Scotland Yard will solve the
mystery rest assured

They turn to enter the elegant chambers of Smythe’s office
SMYTHE
The Tapestry hung on the
rear wall of my office --
The Inspector stops short his face darkening with indignation

LESTRADE
What the blazes is he doing here

ates A LEAN HAWK-NOSED GENTLEMAN across the room clad in
formal evening wear overcoat and woolen scaré

The gentleman takes no notice of the newcomers as he peers through

a

A MAGNIFYING GLASS with the utmost concentration closely examining

a series of SMALL HOOKS protruding from the room’s rear wall

He is SHERLOCK HCLMES the world’s

first and only consuici
detective Holmes addresses the Inspect

or without looking
HOLMES

Mind you don‘t touch anything

om your way in Lestrade

LESTRADE
This case is under my jurisdiction
Holmes I give the orders here

SULLIVAN
see you are acquainted with
Mister Sherlock Hoimes and his
associate Doctor Watson

man beside Holmes politely tips his derby to Lestrads --
H WATSON MD Holmes’s chronicler and friend

WATSON
Good evening Inspector Lestrade
Holmes was just anticipating
your officicus arrival

HOLMES
Yes A pity you had to be
called away from billiards
at the Red Rooster Pub

LESTRADE
How in blazes did you know that
)

HOLMES
The smell of ale and tobacco
as well as the sawdust on your
trouser cuffs indicate you came
directly from a pub -- and I am
quite aware the Red Rooster is the
favorite haunt cf Yard detectives
The chalk residue on your right
thumb tells me you were recently
holding a cuestick

Smythe ancé Sullivan look suitably impressed Lestrade snorts

LESTRADE
Bah I’ve no patience for your
parlor tricks tonight Holmes
This is a Yard matter You’ve
no call to be poking your nose here --

SULLIVAN
I requested his assistance in
investigating this perplexing crime

He stops to watch Holmes curiously Holmes has dropped i
all fours his nose to the carpet as he squints through his
magnifying lens and shuffles along the rear wall

Smythe adjusts the monecle in his eye as he speaks

SMYTHE

I came here to my office yesterday
to prepare some budgetary reports
for our upcoming Board of Trustees
conference The tapestry was sctili
on dispiav on that very wall
exquisite weaving of priceless
-ficent Superb

HOLMES

I locked
Upon returning
this evening I discovered

the tapestry missing Stolen

The ransom note was left in

its place -- to mock me

bare rear wall lined with empty hooks

SULLIVAN
The only employees entering the
building over the weekend were
painters hired to paint the
administrative offices down the hal

LESTRADE
at accounts for the smell of
resh paint in the corridors
a tee

Cc

SULLIVAN
But the guards insist they inspected
each worxer as they left

SMYTHE
And I can assure you never
once did anyone besides myself
enter this room Not a soul

TWO MUSEUM GUARDS in grey uniforms appear in the doorway

GUARD
Weve conducted a thorough search
of the entire building Nothing

SMYTHE
The Ling Tau Tapestry must
be returned safely -- undamaged
We have no choice but to pay
the blasted ransom

WATSON
Hhmm A priceless Chinese artifact
disappears from the British Museum
without a trace This makes for
one of your more unusual cases
wouldnt you say Holmes

Holmes has been carefully examining every inch of the office
including the carpeting all four walls and Smythe’s antique desk

HOLMES
Unusual yes Watson but not as
stimulating as I might have hoped

(to the others)
Gentleman I trust it will alleviate
your anxiety to inform you that
I have determined the location of
the missing Tapestry

ing Watson react with stunned expressicns

smiling proudly

WATSON

cf course I’m not surprise

ron

SULLIVAN
Oh praise Heaven How in the
world was the Tapestry removed
from the Museum

HOLMES
Truth be told the Tapestry
never left this office

eneral exclamations from everyone all around
LESTRADE
Really Holmes what nonsense
are you prattling

Holmes simply grabs A VIKING BROADSWORD off a wall display
As the others watch flabbergasted Holmes choos hard ino she su5oth

paneling of the rear wali

SMYTHE
Have you gone daft man

Holmes yanks aside an entire panel of the splintered wail --
to reveal THE CHINESE TAPESTRY hanging on the wali hidden behind

WATSON
The wall is a fake

HOLMES
The “painters” carried in materials
and constructed this false wall
to conceal the tapestry behind it
from view -- taking pains to
ensure that their detailed facade
matched the other walls exactly

SULLIVAN
Ingenious

LESTRADE
And so once the ransom was pai
the thieves planned to dissemble
the faise wail and thus “return”
the Tapestry undamaged

SULLIVAN
But how could the thieves have
accomplished all this with Colonel
Smythe present in the office
HOLMES
The answer is elementary
The Colonel nas been lying
He is a participant in this
clever and ambitious hoax

in this crime
nonsense Poppycock

s leather chair

HOLMES
BR drop of moist paint lies

undisturbed on the seat of your
chair -- proving you did not sit
working at your desk as you claim

(indicating the windows)
Also I have determined from the
angle of these windows that the
sun would be shining directly
into your face just before dusk
I find it inconceivable that
you would remain in this spot
without closing the shutters
to shield your eyes from the
blinding rays of the setting sun
SMYTHE
But -- bur I did close them

HOLMES
Highly unlikely since the cobwebs
along the top edges of these shutters
are ail undisturbed -- evidencing
that these shutters have not been
closed in quite some time
(as Smythe sweats profuse-y)
I would venture to speculate
that either financial need or
blackmail were elements in
securing the Colonels cooperation
in such a daring criminal scheme
Until I obtain further facts --

Smythes features slowly twist into defiant rage

SMYTHE
I haG no choice He threatened
to ruin me

He suddenly produces A REVOLVER from his coat pocket

SULLIVAN
Celonel Good God

SMYTHE
Zil shoct the first man who moves --

Lestrade Watson and the suarcés raise their hands cautiously
Hoimes merely watches calmly as Smythe backs out of the office
Siamming the cffice door snut behind him

CONTINUOUS

as Watson trails Lestrade down the corridor
y surveys the hallway keen eyes alert --

and spsts Smythe’s GOLD MONOCLE on the floor directly in front of
red velvet curtain covering one wall
Holmes sweeps aside the curtain to reveal A HIDDEN DOOR

Smythe emerges onto the roof of the British Museum

A young Museum CLEANING GIRL leans against a lowset chimney
eating her meager supper of bread and cheese and enjoying the
panoramic view of the London skyline
She drops her food startled to see Smythe stagger uz to her

GIRL
Colonel Smythe I was just
headin’ back to me rounds --

Holmes steps onto the roof in time to see Smythe grad the ciri
She screams as Smythe presses his revolver to her head

SMYTHE
Stay away Or I‘11 kill her

EOLMES
Calm down Colonel Tell me
who is blackmailing you

SMYTHE
He never said his name
An eloquent man with a
silver-topped cane A huge
black mastiff always at his side --

HOLMES

SMYTHE

I took a mistress -- a cheap
music hall dancer God help me
she bewitched me to betray my w

One hand slowly moves towards

SMYTHE
Never Its over for me now
My career -- my life -- are all
in shambles All because of vou

Hali-crased Smythe cocks the trigger about to shoot Holmes --

s Zlings a handful of bread crumbs at Smythe
mn Smythe is startled by the bizarre action --

ef ROOFTOP PIGEONS hungry for crumbs flock arouns
cking his zim The cleaning girl squeals in Smythe’s
birds flutter around her --

Holmes SPRINGS forward and TACKLES Smythe to the rooltop
The cleaning girl breaks free and frantically scrambles away

The two men wrestle on che rooftop as Holmes fights for the gun
clenched in Smythe’s fist The revolver goes cif the bu
ZINGING past Holmes’s head like an angry bee

Holmes and Smythe grapple fiercely

and begin to roll down the sloping roof cof the British Museum

Smythe reaches the edge first and tumbles off with a scream --
PLUMMETING four stories to his death on the cobblestones below

Holmes slides down the slippery roof tiles as well He
scrambles in his overcoat unable to grab a handhold s
closer to the edge and the fatal drop --

As Holmes rolls off the rooftop -- he unwraps his woolen scart and

lashes it out like a whip The end of the scarf snags a marble
ornament on the rooftop edge

The scarf yanks taut but holds -- as Holmes hangs on precariousiy
dangling in mid-air

A tense moment as Holmes swings himself towards the buiising
He releases his grip on the scarf sails through the air --

and lands nimbly on a narrow ledge running the length of the
Museums front facade Sate

CONSTANCE
Ah vou must be Doctor Watson
I am Miss Constance Bracknell

WATSON
(bows politely)
At your service And may I present
Sherlock Holmes consulting detective

CONSTANCE
Mister Holmes I‘m an ardent
reader of your adventures each
month in The Strand

jolmes takes her hand with limp disinterest already bored
HOLMES
Of course you are I see you
came from the Hyde Park district
most likely by Waterbury Street
Though I doubt you rode your
velocipede this morning as is
your usual custom

CONSTANCE
Why that is indeed correct

WATSON
Impressive isn’t it

CONSTANCE

I suppose You undoubtedly observed
the cherry blossom petals on my
shawl which fell from the trees
in bloom surrounding Hyde Park
The pavement along Waterbury Street
is currently under construction
which you rightly deduced as the
source of the dried mortar dust
soiling the hem of my skirt

(indicates her skirt)
And most likely you noticed the
slight callouses on my hands --
the result of repeatedly gripping
my Licycle’s steering handles

Holmes eyes her intrigued by her unexpected mental acuity

HOLME
You also have scratches on the
upper sides of your shoes marking
where your feet have slipped off
the pedals

CONSTANCE
An of course I had not noticed
All quite -- how would you say --
elementary I see Doctor Watsons
published accounts of your exploit
did not embellish your deductive
abilities I am pleased

to sé Holmes warm noticeably to this flattery

HOLMES
Forgive my manners Miss Bracknell
Would vou care for some tea

dead in his study this morning

only door was locked from the inside
and a suicide note in his own
handwriting was left on his desk

Excuse my bluntness Miss Bracknell
but such clear-cut evidence of suicide
would appear to rule out foul play

CONSTANCE
Arthur would never kill himself
Moreover he was in fine spirits
when he retired for the evening
I wish you to come to our London
townhouse to investigate I shall
pay whatever remuneration you name

Both she and Watson look expectantly to Holmes for his response

OLMES
My condolences for your loss
Miss Bracknell but I am afraid
I must decline your offer
My apologies and good day

I believe she suffered from a rare
blood disease I met her once --
a vivacious young girl named
Lucy Westenra She was treated
by several doctors including a
specialist from the Continent

WATSON
Was Codaiming distraught over
her death

CONSTANCE

For a while But never suicidal
His mood had distinctly improved
since my mother and I came to live
with him several months ago --
after my own engagement came

to unfortunate termination

WATSON
Oh dear I’m dreadfully sorry --

CONSTANCE
Oh no My former fiancé is fine
Lets just say when one partner
proved reluctant to surrender the
independence afforded by single life
any prospects for a successful
marriage seemed unlikely

aren

Holmes alights from the cab first with little entt
Watson follows and offers his arm to assist Const

WATSON
A common attitude among we habituéi
bachelors No reason for you to
take personal offense

Constance ignores his outstretched hand and leaps down nimbiy from
the carriage on her own

CONSTANCE
I don’t I was the one who
refused to relinquish my freedom

INT TOWNHOUSE HALLWAY- DAY

Agnes Bracknell flutters nervously as she leads Holmes Watson and
Constance down an opulently decorated hallway

AGNES
Honestly Constance after I
specifically insisted we handle
this tragedy discreetly you
impetuously venture out on your
own and summon the services of
the great Sherlock Eolmes himself

HOLMES
I have not agreed to provide
my services quite yet Madam

They stop before A BROKEN DOOR resting on splintered hinges
CONSTANT
This is Arthur’s study
I insisted that-nothing be touched

the doorway into the study --

from a rafter A SILK CORD is cz

Such a horrible end I cannot
stay here God have mercy

her hands and hurries off Constance steels he
for Holmes and Watson to enter before her

seins so the study Holmes‘s entire demeanor changes
revitalized as nis professional instincts take command

Constance watch with interest as Holmes moves slowly
room methodically absorbing every inch of his

-- carefully inspecting the carpeted floor the
“the shelf-lined walls the study’s only window

without expression Holmes regards the hanging corpse

HOLMES
Ehmm the bellpull was cut
and fashioned into a makeshift nocse
Who forced the locked door open

the noose his weight on the
stool would have lefc indentations
on the carpet directly below

his body But there are none
WATSON

Someone must have lifted him us

answer and instead crosses to the desk
pinned to the desktop by an elaborate DAGGER

HOLMES

“I cannot live with guilts from
my sins Only death can right
my crime most grievous I beg
humbly forgiveness to our Lord”
Peculiar wording indeed

Observe Godalmings left wrist

Watson sees that the left wrist of the corpse is bandaged

CONSTANCE
Arthur sprained his wrist yesterday
when he slipped on the front walk
He could barely move his hand

HOLMES
Yet the cursive script on this note
is flawless A Super iative forgery
Tell me Miss Bracknell what is the
significance of this dagger

Ee holds up the dagger pinning the note to the desk The handle is
fashioned of carved oak and is engraved with FOREIGN RUNES

CONSTANCE
It was a keepsake of Arthurs

I never noticed it before

HOLMES
The dust on this mantel indicates
ere the dagger was on display
inned the note purposely
dagger -- and not any of
paperweights on the desk
has signiticance

WATSON
Perhaps a trap door in the roof --
like the one Tongo used to murder
Bartholomew Sholto and escape undetected
CONSTANCE
Yes -- as related in your account

of The Sign of The Four But there

is none Anyone using that window
would have to scale the outside wall

Holmes peers out the window -- the yard below is a drop of
ur stories down a sheer brick wall

Holmes produces his MAGNIFYING LENS and leans out to exam
window sill as well as the outside bricks beneath

HOLMES
Odd Areas of the ivy show
signs of being disturbed
There are aiso hand prints on
the moss covering the bricks

CONSTANCE
So the kilier climbed up the wali

HOLMES
Perhaps Except that the prints
are on the underside of the bricks
As if the killer climbed down the
wall -- headfirst Most curicus

CONSTANCE
But how can that be

Watson stands near the body inspecting Godalming’s boots

WATSON
Holmes -- come look at this
(indicates)
Usually bodily fluids settle down
around the ankles thus bloating
the feet This is not the case here
It’s ailmosc as if Godalming’s
corpse has been somehow drained
of most of its blood

denly Constance bolus from the room with a stifled cry

Emotional involvement is a hindrance
to cold hard deductive reasoning

it to wither away completely

She forces a smile attempting to reccver her composure as she

CONSTANCE
Mister Holmes have you any
idea why Arthur was murdered

HOLMES
I have three distinct theories at

But I will assure you of this
Miss Bracknell -- fully intend
to apprehend your cousin’s killer

EXT GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

The sun sets over a crumbling forlorn graveyard situated hich on
a bluff overlooking the vast London skyline

INT MAUSOLEUM - NIGHT

Inside the ruins of a musty mausoleum the Russian Wojcek waits
eagerly beside an elegant polished COFFIN

The coffin stirs -- and the lid slowly opens Wojcek’s eyes widen
in anticipation behind his thick spectacles

Count Dracula arises and steps from the casket dustin
formal clothes Eis features are pale gaunt but his
with cold hellfire

DRACULA
I heve warned you against polluting
your blood with that cursed drug

WOIJCEK

filthy ruins not fit for rodents

MATCHING DISSOLVE To

wings outstretched etched into
along with assorted foreign runes

Several patrons sit reading at long tables between rows of tall
bookshelves A musty studious atmosphere

Watson sits besides Holmes consulting A THICK REFERENCE VOLUME

HOLMES
As I suspected Godalming’s dagger
is of Slavic design A similar
knife was used in the murder of
a Bulgarian prostitute two years

ago among the rookeries of Whitechapel

WATSON
Some type of ceremonial dagger

HOLMES
Used in gypsy rituals
particularly among nomadic clans
of Mulrovia and Transylvania

WATSON
And you suspect Godalming’s murderer
is from that region as well

HOLMES
The mincr mistakes in grammar
Suggests that the note was forged
by someone not wholly familiar
with the English languace
The wording of the note also
suggests that the killers motive
may have been vengeance --
Godalming “confesses” to committing
a grievous transgression that
will be righted by his death

WATSON
So Godalming’s murder involved
an unknown foreigner and
a gypsy dagger brought from
eastern Europe That narrows
the field of suspects considerably

HOLMES
This incident is most likely
related to Godalming’s trip to
that same locale a year earlier --
specifically the wilderness region
near the Carpathian Mountains

WATSON
A trip related to the death of
Miss Lucy Westenra

HOLMES
Precisely Watson I’m pleased
to see you’ve grasped a basic --
although obvious -- line of
deductive logic

He incéicates a drawing in the reference volume to Watson
Tt is A SKETCH with scrawled designs similar to the runes
on the dagger found pinned to Godalming’s desk

Holmes unields the suicide note found on Godalming’s desk
C

He takes a folder cf NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS from Watson and spr
them open on the table

HOLMES
Our next source of data --
a cutting of Lucy Westenras
obituary from the librarys
archive copy of The London Times

WATSON
Hhmn Rather sparse details
of young Lucy’s background but
it does mention her treating
physician as Doctor John Seward

HOLMES
And if I recall correctly and
I usually do this Doctor Seward
runs a private mental asylum near
Carfax I attended his last lecture
on the obsessive compulsions of the
criminally insane A verbose but
conceptually imaginative presentation

WATSON
Then we must locate Seward at once
Perhaps he can shed some light on
this mysterious journey that has
yielded such tragic consequences

Holmes snaps the folder shut as a satisfied smile appears

HOLMES
Fortunately I believe I know where
we can locate Seward this evening

DR ABRAHAM VAN HELSING sits reading in his garden conservatory
He is heavyset with pince-nez spectacles and a trimmed coatee

The conservatory is a small glass greenhouse adjoining the rear cf
his faculty lodgings filled with lush flowers and plants

Van Helsing pauses distracted by A CANARY in its cage
The bird shrills frantically obviously agitated and frightened

Van Helsing then hears THE PATTER OF TINY PAWS against glass --
and glances up to see ARAT scurryine across the glass ceiling of

the conservatory

Van Helsing watches in amazement as more and more squealing rats
appear swarming across the glass ceiling and walls --

until the entire glass conservatory surrounding Van Helsinc is
covered with teeming rats all seen from beneath

Van Helsing leaps up as A CRACKING NOISE reverberates --
the glass ceiling is collapsing from the weight of the rodents

Van Helsing hurries inside as sections of the ceiling shatter an
vats vain down upon him gnashing viciously at his body

Grunting with disgust Van Helsing brushes the chittering rats from
his clothes as he staggers into the safety of his study --

and is stunned to find an ominous visitor waiting for him

sleep in a coffin filled with his
native soil in oxder to rejuvenate
his powers Dracula most likely

from Transylvania to be shipped

all over London -- thus the meaning
behind Van Helsings warning

seek out his unholy ground
HOLMES
Dracula will most likely set up
refuges throughout the city --
each in a dark isolated area

How can you be so sure

Because that is precisely what I
would do I surmise that Dracula
arrived in England by vessel shortly
before Godalming was murdered
We can check the records of local
shipping companies to see if a number
of crates were transported from the

Dracula grasps Manclers empty keg of rum and yanks THE METAL
SPIGOT from the barrel Before Dawson can move Dracula rams the

spigot deep into Dawsons heart

Dawson stares dumbly at the tap protruding from his chest then

carrying towels They pass a private room with its door closed
INSIDE THE HOSPITAL ROOM
Van Helsing lies uncenscicus in bed Holmes and Watson mov
about the room hanging CRUCIFIXES on the walls

unassailable by Dracula we must

to Godalming Manor A smile spreads across his pale lips

Constance climrs the steps drawing her shawl around her

DRACULA
Good evening my fine lady --

CONSTANCE
Oh You startled me

Seeing Constance up close for the first time Dracula is enthralled
by her remarkable beauty

DRACULA
It has been countless decades since
I have savored such loveliness

CONSTANCE
Surely you exaggerate sir
Now if youll excuse me --

DRACULA

Forgive me I am Count Dracula

to offer my condolences on his
lamentable passing Miss

She does not resist as Dracula leads her off into the night

EXT LONDON STREET - NIGET

Dracula strolls with Constance along a boulevard bustling with
metropolitan nightlife -- theatergoers peddlers beggars

Dracuia listens to Constance chatter with indulgent patience

CONSTANCE

To suggest that our sex does not

locations for Dracula’s new lair --

Holmes glances up noting his SHADOW on the wall cast by the oil

Somehow Holmes’s plea reaches through to the remote recesses of
Watson’s embattled mind Watson falters -- his true self emerging
for just an instant Anguish breaks across his face

WATSON
Dear God Holmes

As Dracula’s hypnotic commands inexorably force Watscn to aim the
revolver squarely at Holmes --

Watson wrenches his hand aside in a desperate surge of will and
presses the revolver against his own temple Just as his finger

tightens on the trigger --

A dull CLANG is heard Watson slumps to the floor the gun
dropping from his grasp

Tired of cowardly manipulating others

MORIARTY
There are three Yard detectives
Gisguised as peddlers patrolling
the pavement while two more lie
in wait for you inside your flac

HOLMES
Moriarty What dastardly scheme
are you concocting now

MORIARTY
I’ve not come to assail you
Holmes I’m here because of that
soulless devil known as Dracula

HOLMES
Youve narrowly escaped
Dracula’s clutches as well

MORIARTY
Yes Integrating that accursed
fiend into my organization was a
serious miscalculation He must
pay for his treachery against me

HOLMES
So you were in league with the
vampire all along f should
have deduced as much
MORIARTY
No lonser We must combine our
eiforts tc destroy nim before his
mad plans for conquest reach fruition
HOLMES
No ill ncc ally myselt with

a blackguard as yourseli --
no matter how dire my piight

MORIARTY
Holmes listen to me Whatever
enmity has festered between us
must be set aside You are the
only man alive capable of aiding
me in vanauishing Dracula

bitterly vealizing the truth of Moriarty’s words

HOLMES
I cannot allow Dracula to empower
himself unchecked any further

MORIARTY
4h Then we are unlikely allies
for the forces of Good acgainsc
the legions of Evil The eternal
cosmic polarities reduced to
base set of prime integers

HOLMES
Your grandiose posturing does
not deceive me Moriarty
You desire Dracula’s obliteration
only so that you may regain control
of your illicit web of crime

MORIARTY
(glowers)
You can ill afford to impugn
my motives Holmes Ill not
brook such sanctimonious aspersions
from an overrated brain for hire” --

HOLMES
Enough This squabbling is pointiess
Dracula must be found before Constance --

MORIARTY

Photography equipment
Perhaps you should read this

(hands Holmes a newspaper)
A street photographer was
discovered dead last night
with his jugular vein ripped open
The probability that this murder
is related to our missing vampire
is statistically overwhelming

HOLMES

Uriah Terkel I had the dubious
pleasure of meeting this poor
camera vendor only days ago
So it was Terkel’s paraphernalia
Dracula appropriated But why

(brightening)
Of course Terkel’s “darkroom” van

MORIARTY
Darkroom van You mean a
light-prool conveyance

HOLMES
Precisely Dracula undoubtedly
utilizea Terkel’s sealed wagon
to transport his coifin throug
the streets in open daylighc

MORIARTY
So our cardinal objective is
fundamental -- locate this
Garkroom van before nightfall
HOLME
That van could be anywhere in
London Fortunately I happen

to have a rather sizeable contingent
of eager young detectives to assist
in our search

The map of London is now dotted with various locations throughout
the city circled in red and numbered

Holmes stands before A MAKESHIFT CHEMICAL LABORATORY working among
assorted test tubes vials and bottles cluttered together on a
rickety table

Rested he looks better nis features tense with concentration

a

iz of tongs to lift A BEAKER from a bunsen burner an
GREENISH-COLORED LIQUID inside

Then tilting the beaker carefully he pours the soluzion into
A GLASS TEST TUBE held securely in a wooden rack

Holmes turns as Professor Moriarty enters the room clutching
a velvet carpetbag Moriarty greets him with a dry chuckle

MORIARTY
The renowned Sherlock Holmes
reduced to hiding from the law
An unexpected treat to behold

Holmes faiis to hide his irritation as he lowers the beaker

HOLMES
I am pleased my predicament
amuses one of us Unfortunately
there is stiil no word from my
amateur contingent of field agents

MORIARTY
You mean your motley gang of
street urchins I at least
have been productive accumulating
i nventive weaponry for our
confrontation

MORIARTY
Any success with your chemical
experiments

ROLMES
Let us hope so It could very
well be our last defense

MORIARTY

Excellent Precise planning
thorough preparation and a dose
of imagination comprise the
formula for any successful crime --

(quickly)
or civilian enterprise as the
case may be

HOLMES
Intriguing You derive such
immense satisfaction by squandering
your mathematical genius merely
to plot clever and complex felonies

MORIARTY

While you delight in misapplying
your own mental prowess merely

to solve those very same felonies

HOLMES
Tt is indeed ironic -- our mutual
rivalry seems to provide us with
the intellectual stimulation we crave

MORIARTY
Indeed The Versailles Affair
for example where I soundly
outwitted you by employing a pair
of identical twin safecrackers
You spurred me to my best efforts
HOLME

Or your theft of Oxfords
Shakespearean Folio by substituting
an expert forgery My devising

that trap to retrieve the manuscripts
and ensnare your accomplices was

an unforgettable challenge

MORIARTY
Ban ‘Twas the inepcitude of
my operatives that foiled me
My plan was brilliantly conceived

7né boy Wiggins bursts into the room breathless and agitated

WIGGINS
I spotted the van

Holmes and Moriarty forget all else to rush over

HOLMES
Excelient Wiggins Well dene
WIGGINS
It was ‘eading along Newberry Road
outside a’ London -- near Burwood

Moriarty peints his cane at a junction on the huge London man

MORIARTY
That particular road forks in two
directions -- one leading inland
the other towards the coastline
co Wiggins)
Which turnoff did the van take

WIGGINS
I dinna know sir I couldnt
keep up with it after a mile or so

MORIARTY
Idiot You let our quarry escape --

Wiggins cringes as Moriarty waves his cane angrily

HOLMES
Now Wiggins It is critical
that we determine the destination
of that van TI want you to
think carefully and relate to me
any observations you can recall
concerning the van or its driver

WIGGINS
) ( Well The driver was a scrawn
fella with these funny thick
spectacles on his nose He had
a lady sittin’ beside ‘im
A looker she was Very purty

MORIARTY
Griver is Draculas steward
ve no idea of the female’s identity

HOLMES
She is an innocent victim of
Dracuia’s sorcery

y composes himsell ignoring Moriarty’s stare

HOLMES
Can you remember anything else
Wiggins Any details whatsoever

WIGGINS
Well the lady was holdin’ a
Slicker ‘cross her lap which
took to be kinda strange since
it ain’t rainin’ outside none

HOLMES
And what of the driver Was
ria he wearing anything unusual
WIGGINS
Nooo his clothes were
all worn and dirty -- but he
did nave an umbrella tucked
in beside him I saw it

MORIARTY
Curious Protective raingear
on a sunny cloudless day

Eolmes steps up to the map and studies the roadway

HOLMES

Perhaps they sought protection
not from natural elements but
man-made precipitation

(pointing)
The southern road from the fork
passes through the coastal
industrial section near Rivington
Coal refineries gaswork factories
smelting furnaces -- an area
renowned for atmospheric deposits
of heavy soot and grime

MORIARTY
But why journey such a distance

They pender the question when Wiegins tugs on Eolme

WIGGINS
Mister ‘olmes there is one
more thing I distinctly
heard the driver whistlin’ a
peculiar tune as he drove past

notes of A DOLEFUL MELODY as best a
HOLME
The Turnkeys Dirge Convicts

cften mi it as they trudge
around the prison yard

MORIARTY
Ehmm Newgate Prison is only
kilometers away from Rivington
HOLME
Cf course Dracula could easily

incapacitate the guards and free

s

‘s

the most vicious criminals in Enc¢land

MORIARTY
Whom Dracula could transform
into ruthiess vampire soldiers
A simple matter of injecting his
blood into each violent felon

officials We must venture to
Newgate ourselves -- before sunset

Moriarty gestures to TEREE BURLY THUGS lined up on the sidewalk

MORIARTY
Allow me to present our new recruits
This is “Hungry” Hank Thompson
“Matchstick” Mullin and “Winky”
Greggs The toughest enforcers
for hire on all of Dorset Street

The thugs nod curtly at Holmes HUNGRY THOMPSON is a huge brawler
weighing nearly 300 pounds MATCHSTICK MULLIN is tall with a
fxrizzled shock of red hair giving rise to his nickname

The bouncer WINKY GREGGS sports a broken nose and a facial sic
-- his right eye twitches constantly as if lewdly winking

HOLMES
These weapons may be your only
defense against the demon we hunt
Do not underestimate his strength

He hands each man A CRUCIFIX and A GRENADE CANISTER from his
satchel The thugs regard the items with amused curiosity

THOMPSON
A lotta fuss over some gadabout
who thinks he’s a vampire

Holmes frecwns as the men rumble cuttural laughs

When Sahid actacked us he

MORIARTY
Dracula has learned how to create
new vampires by injecting his
blood into a victims metabolism
through artificial means If he
were to interfuse his blood into
London’s gaslight network --

Dracula must be destroyed --

harbored an underlying respect
for your remarkable criminal
talents But I see now you are

Soon a new Army of Darkness

The birth of the new Vampire Dynasty

is upon us

He slams shut the metal hatch
Mangler throws an iron lever
STEAM ENGINE churns and pumps

in a dramatic gesture of victory
and the CONDENSOR chugs as its
the deadly concoction

Moriarty carefully studies the maze of pipes the steaming engines
and the pumping pistons of the station

MORIARTY
(low to Holmes)

Accounting for the pumping
engine’s maximum air pressure
I estimate perhaps ten minutes
before the tainted gas reaches
metropolitan London We don’t
have much time

But Holmes is not listening to Moriarty’s grave rronouncement
Re is staring at CONSTANCE who saunters into their midst

Still entranced by the Counts dark spell she radiates an
otherworldly beauty in a wispy gossamer gown of black
A WHITE LILLY is pinned to her hair offsetting her dark tresses

Dracula is occupied watching Woicek and his wagon pull into the m
pumping station and draw up beside the photographic van

Wojcek lifts Van Helsing dazed and disheveled from the rear of the
wagon amidst PILES OF FOLDED CANVAS and SOILED RAGS

Wojcek does not notice one lump of canvas cloth sz
Upon seeing Holmes held prisoner Van Helsing sags

she rresses against Holmes and fixes him with a sultry gaze

CONSTANCE
I warned you to stay away

HOLMES
Constance -- save yourself while
you can Dracula is condemning
you to eternal damnation
CONSTANCE
No -- with the Master’s
wondrous gift I will be free
to indulge my every desivre
answerable to no man
My beauty shall never wrinkle
with age and I will live long
enough to escape this rigid
societys oppression of my sex
What could be more thrilling

HOLMES
But it is a hollow temptation
To sacrifice not only your soul
but your family -- your faith --
(with effort)

and the love of a foolish man
too proud to admit the depth of
his true feelings for you

His eyes lock with Constance’s and for a moment the force of his
love for her breaks through Draculas spell to touch her

Until Dracula forcibly pulls Constance away sneering at Holmes

DRACULA

Your pathetic entreaties to win
her heart are futile What can
you offer her except the miserable
short-lived existence of a lowly
mortal She is mine now -- and
all that awaits for you is a
painful and Gramatic death

Moriarty unsheaths his sword-cane slashing frantically away at the
Slapping cloud of winged rodents Bat after bat falls dead beneath
his slicing blade to be replaced by ten more

Holmes flails his arms against the onslaught of bats to no avail --
dozens more swoop down from every nook of the cavernous factory

beating their wings in a frenzied chaotic attack

MORIARTY

The bats rip relentlessly at the canvas quickly slitting the tarp
to shreds Holmes and Moriarty bleed from dozens of scratches as
they struggle valiantly to protect themselves from the onslaught

Both men exchange grim looks each aware that certain death is only
moments away --

In seconds Wojcek is smothered under half a ton of loose coal

His glasses the thick lenses shattered skitter along the floor

Holmes whirls and finds himself face to face with Count Dracula

DRACULA
Very impressive Mister Holmes
But this is one duel you cannot win

And before Holmes can react Dracula attacks with inhuman speed

He slams Holmes in the stomach then again in the chin --

each time a super-fast blur of motion Holmes is unable to biock

stumbles back off balance and falls from the uwoper deck --

into a huge metal COAL BIN Feeble and disoriented Dracula lies
sprawled atop the pile of coal chunks --

Thank you Sherlock

INT 2213 BAKER STREET - AFTERNOON

Holmes anc Watson are back in their parlor relaming
Watson sits in his armchair sipping from a snifter of brandy

his meerschaum pipe clenched in
owers in the plain clay vase have been

loral arrangement of red and yellow roses

Holmes stands at the mantie
his teeth The withered il
replacea with a vibrant f

tate

Holmes picks up a velvet PERSIAN SLIPPER stuffed full of tobacco

HOLMES
So Watson Now that the Case
of the Vengeful Vampire is closed
I doubt your readers will
believe your account of this
singularly outlandish adventure

WATSON
I am reluctantly inclined to agree
Perhaps it is best my pen never
set down the true events which
transpired these past few days

As Eolmes methodically fills his pipe with tobacco Watson clears
his throat and fumbles self-consciously
WATSON
Holmes the terrible things
I uttered to you when I was
under Dracula’s hypnotic spell
My words -- my actions --
were inexcusable I don’t
see how you could ever forgive
my despicable behavior

Watson’s gaze is downcast unable to meet Holmes in the eye
Holmes smiles There is a warmth to his tone rarely heard

HOLMES

Watson John

(Watson looks up)
Perhaps I am at fault for not
expressing enough how deeply --
and how often -- I depend on you
Many times in my bleakest hour
your unwavering loyalty your
unassuming warmth of spirit
have been the sole compass
which unerringly leads me
back to my sense of humanity
I could not imagine being the
Great Detective I am without
my closest friend by my side

WATSON
(flustered)
Why that’s very gracious of
you Sherlock
Holmes merely nods in acknowledgment and takes a puff on his sire

HOLMES
Bh I see Mrs Hudson has
brought up the dcay’s mail
Perhaps a new client requests
our services to solve another
intriguing mystery

letter

He opens A HANDWRITTEN ENVELOPE and unfolds the enciose¢a
Gleam of excitement lights his eyes as he reads

HOLMES
“To my esteemed opponent
The truce has ended and
the dance resumes anew --
Are you up to the challenge”
(shows Watson)
It‘s signed “Your incomparable
adversary -- M

WATSON
Moriarty So he survived the
explosion after all But what
challenge could he possibly mean

HOLMES
I suggest you peruse the
headlines of today’s Times

Watson snatches up the newspaper and gapes at the front page

WATSON

“Queens Rembrandt Stolen From
Buckingham Palace in Daring Theft
Scotland Yard Mystified by
Unknown Criminal Mastermind”

(stunned)
That incorrigible scoundrel
has struck again

HOLMES
Indeed my overly ambitious
nemesis has outdone himself ’
We must act swiftly -- before
the blundering police ruin
what few clues may remain

As he slips into his brown inverness their landlady Mrs Hudson
bustles into the room wringing her hands

MRS HUDSON
Don’t be telling me you two
will be missing dinner again

HOLMES
Allow me to offer my apologies
dear Mrs Hudson -- and this token

of my undying appreciation
He plucks A RED ROSE from the bouquet on the mantle and hands one
gallantly one to Mrs Hudson -- and actually bends over to kiss her
lightly on the cheek

Mrs Hudson is stunned speechless -- never has Holmes displayed
such overt affection to her before

Holmes quickly dons his deerstalker hat He hurries to the
doorway pausing to beckon excitedly to Watson

HOLMES
Let us be off Watson
The game is afoot once more
He dashes out the door with Watson only seconds behind
Alone Mrs Hudson bursts into a smile as she lifts the rose
blossom to her nostrils and inhales its fragrance
EXT BAKER STREET - DAY

As Holmes and Watson stride off into the distance Holmes can be
seen gesturing animatedly his old confident and dynamic self

The two friends are soon lost amidst the bustling pedestrians
braying street vendors and clip-clopping horse-drawn hansoms

A noisy congested wonderful London afternoon teeming with life

THE END
