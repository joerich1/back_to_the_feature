HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES

Written by RW Zombie

FADE IN
INT OLD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

We see a LITTLE GIRL dancing around in a grainy super 8
home movie A LITTLE BOY wearing a monster MASK enters
the frame He struggles to lift a double barrel shotgun
He points it at the girl and pretends to SHOOT

GIRL

(voice over whispering slowly)
Once I had a cat he was the sweetest
little guy Then one day he got sick
and died My heart was broken My
whole body hurt

She continues dancing The little boy imitates her

GIRL (CONTD)
After that I saw things differently
everything could be summed up with
three simple words fuck the world

The camera swings over to some ugly toothless relations
watching the show They laugh

EXT SPAULDINGS - NIGHT

We open on a dark lonely stretch of two lane blacktop
Off to the side of the road we see a rundown gas station

RADIO ANNOUNCER

the moldies The good the bad and
the uglies straight from the WJRC

A weathered wooden sign proclaims CAPTAIN SPAULDINGS
WORLD OF MONSTERS AND MADMEN sits atop the building
A smaller sign below reads FRIED CHICKEN AND GASOLINE

RADIO ANNOUNCER

Jerry is stretched out across the front seat reading
a book on Freak Shows Denise and Mary sit in the
back curled up under layers of blankets and clothes

DENISE
Fuck its freezing

JERRY
Hey listen to this I think this
is related to our Dr Satan

DENISE
Oh yeah

JERRY
Yeah in this book theres a chapter
called Self Made Freaks about how
people would mutilate themselves in
order to work in a freak show It
mostly talks about tattooed people
and wild men of Borneo and shit like
that but there is one mention of a
single case where a woman was
suspected of having her arms removed
on purpose to become an arm-less
wonder

DENISE
Yeah so how does that fit with the
story of four morons with a flat tire
looking for a dead tree

JERRY
It says “records show that Ellie
Thompson was born in 1914 of normal
physical stature and lived a life of
normal bearings until such time that
she was placed in the care of the
Willows State Mental Facility

DENISE
So

JERRY
Now she was put in the nuthouse in
1930 at the age of 16

DENISE
Why
JERRY
(scanning the book)
Blah blah blah it doesnt say

but she was released sometime in 1937
only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan the
arm-less wonder Says she criss-
crossed the United States constantly
in carnivals and freak shows until
her death in 1946

DENISE
Yeah

JERRY
These dates perfectly correspond
with the time frame of our beloved
Dr Satan working at the looney bin
Ill bet he amputated her arms

DENISE
So what

JERRY
I dont know I just thought it was
interesting

DENISE
You know what Jerry who really cares
at this point

(to himself)

up the main drive

Baby runs forward and begins jumping around in the
huge mud puddles then runs up onto the front porch
of the old house

The front of the house is covered with strange junk
art Hundreds of dolls faces are nailed to the walls

Bill stands looking off into the distance at the
desolate farm grounds The rain continues to hammer
down

From BILLS POV we see a silhouette of a LONE FIGURE
walking in the distance The shape of a large dog
follows behind him

As they move into the light of the hallway it is clear
that Grampa is in his late 80s

Grampa quickly grows tired Tiny picks him up in his
arms and carries him down the stairs to the dining room

As they move past the camera comes to rest on a STRANGE

Dirty dishes overflow from the rusty metal sink onto
the surrounding counters A large cat walks across
piles of food left to rot on a table Boxes of trash
and old newspapers are stacked to the ceiling

Music from a crackling radio is heard

Mother stands stirring a large pot on the stove A
LOUD knocking interrupts her cooking She sets down
her spoon and walks to the front door

Before opening the door she peeks through the curtains
of a small side window She sees Wydell and runs from

before he is hit in the back by a bullet He stumbles

and falls to his knees

as his life passes before him

A quick MONTAGE we see the following images flash by

a A father and daughter together in happier times

Otis fires another shot
Willis falls forward into the mud dead

Naish sees Willis fall Before he can react a voice

a distant popping sound is heard Naish falls over on

his side

The scene fades to blood red

EXT FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

The house stands silent in the darkness Lightning
crashes a heavy rain falls

Burning JACK-O-LANTERNS beam from every window Smoke
rises from the chimney

It is Halloween night
INT FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
CLOSE-UP TV

Dr Wolfenstein is on screen smashing pumpkins with a
giant hammer

madmen to go to work so lock your
doors and bolt your windows sit
back and prepare for a fright night
classic

(lightning crashes)
The House of Frankenstein

The movie begins and we move off the TV to see

Hundreds of CANDLES are lit illuminating everything
with a flickering light Music blares from a cheap
stereo BLACK and ORANGE PAPER STREAMERS are draped
from ceiling to floor

Dead center is a LARGE OBJECT standing seven feet tall
it is completely covered in paper Halloween decorations
A long chain connects the object up into the rafters

This is the Halloween party from Hell

An intoxicated Grampa dressed as FLASH GORDON sits
in his wheelchair watching the TV drinking MOONSHINE
from an unmarked bottle

GRAMPA

(slurred drunken yelling at

the screen)
Get those motherfucker those high
water bitches and rocketship daisies
kill ‘tem kill ‘em

CRASH CRASH CRASH Tiny stands in a corner tunelessly
banging on a large oil drum He is dressed like a low
budget BATMAN in grey long johns and a black bat mask
and cape

A drunk Rufus wearing a bloody police uniform stands
on a table SHOUTING along to the music through a POLICE
MEGAPHONE

Mother and Baby both dressed as SUPERHEROES dance
around the covered object Both are swigging moonshine
from jugs

RUFUS JR
(shouting through megaphone)
Show me show me show me show me

Mother and Baby start TEARING AWAY the paper covering
from the object in the middle of the room They RIP at
the paper spinning and dancing around in a wild pagan
ritual

As the shreds of colored paper fall to the floor we
see Denise Jerry and Mary tied back to back hanging
from the chain each are dressed in a different animal
costume Denise is a pig Jerry is a donkey and Mary
is a rabbit They are gagged

Mother and Baby laugh at their helpless victims
splashing moonshine in their faces

BABY
Drink up its party time

MOTHER
Enjoy your last night
(looking around)
wheres Otis

BABY
Oh hes coming he got something
real special this year

Rufus jumps down begins to spin the bound captives
around and around

RUFUS JR

MOTHER

GRAMPA

GRAMPA
Then we tried to remove the tusks
but they were embedded in so firmly
that we couldnt budge em

MOTHER
(gesturing at Grampa)
Let him finish

GRAMPA
Of course in Alabama the Tuscaloosa
but thats entirely irrelephant

The room goes silent All eyes are focused on the stairs

A robed figure Otis appears at the top of the stairs
he begins to descend
Rufus waits at the bottom of the stairs As Otis reaches
the last step Rufus hands him the megaphone

Denise Mary and Jerry struggle to watch as they in
turn rotate past the scene unfolding

OTIS

(through the megaphone)
Im the one who brings the Christmas
candy now tell me

(pauses and raises his arms)
Whos your Daddy

Otis walks closer to the rotating captives

OTIS (CONTD)
Im the one who brings the devils
brandy

(waits)

MOTHER
Whos your Daddy

OTIS
Yes Im the one who beats you when

BABY
Whos your Daddy

MOTHER

Otis stops the spinning of his prisoners and stands
directly before Denise

He drops his robe underneath he is wearing a SUIT OF
SKIN sewn together from pieces of Denises father

Denise stares in horror tears stream down her cheeks
barely able to comprehend the madness around her

Otis moves in close and licks her across the face

OTIS
Im the one who loves you when youre
fucking dead

Everyone chants Whos your Daddy

OTIS (CONTD)

(imitating Willis)
Now I say my little darlings

(rotates the chain to Mary)
maybe prancing around where you dont
belong aint such a winner of an
idea
(slaps Mary across the face)

Slowly turns the chain to face Jerry

OTIS (CONTD)

And you the great rusher of fools
what were you after

(slaps Jerry)

Huh speak to me

(slaps him again)

Oh thats right Dr Satan every-
body got to know about Dr Satan
Jesus Christ let the old dog rest

foot in the grave and the others

(Jerry stares in shock

GRAMPA
Zarkoff I will conquer the sea the
air the earth the universe

Mother moves in close to Jerry

MOTHER
Look at the way he lights up Grampa

Otis grabs Jerrys cheeks and makes his face move like
a ventriloquist dummy provides Jerrys voice

OTIS
Aw gee whiz Im so excited I

than the Fonzie

Baby grabs Mary and does the same ventriloquist routine

BABY
Oh oh pick me pick me I have a
question

Baby rotates Mary around to where Gramps is seated

BABY (CONTD)

(squeezing Marys face hard)
I was wondering Mr Satan sir do you
like to kiss on the first date or is

GRAMPA
What the fuck are you saying Who the
hell is talking to me

Tiny growing restless begins banging on his metal
drum KLANG - KLANG - KLANG Rufus joins in clapping
his hands

MOTHER
Come on my babies are getting
restless

RUFUS JR
Dump in the pit dump in the pit

Mother Baby Grampa join in chanting with Rufus

OTIS
Alright alright Cut em down its

EXT FIELD - NIGHT

The rain pounds down A heavy fog hovers over the dense
growth of the field In the distance silhouetted by
moonlight a gruesome caravan slowly moves through the
night

Otis lantern in hand leads the way Followed by Baby
and Mother together under a large black umbrella Next
Rufus holds the leash connected to Jerry Denise and
Mary
Bringing up the rear Tiny shotgun focused on the
prisoners and Grampa Grampa is strapped to Tinys
back like a child He waves a flashlight back and
forth like a search beam

The group comes to a halt at a huge wooden structure

OTIS
(handing Baby the lantern)
Hold this Point it over here

Baby directs the light at Otis We see that he is
trying to unlock a huge padlock attached to an iron
door embedded in the base of the wooden structure

Otis unlocks the door and swings it open He reaches
down into the blackness and pulls up an iron hook
and wench attached to the hook is a chain

Otis parts a section of the overgrown grass next to
the pit to reveal a rusty metal crank He begins to
turn the crank Slowly from out of the pit rises
a coffin hanging from the end of the chain

Otis pulls the coffin over and lays it flat on the
ground He flips open the lid

OTIS (CONTD)
Hey happy-boy step your ass up here

Rufus cuts loose Jerry but holds him steady by the
neck

BABY
Take his gag out its more fun with
the screaming

MOTHER
Yeah I like the screaming too its

Rufus cuts loose the gag

JERRY

kiss

MOTHER (CONTD)

towards the coffin

OTIS

JERRY

Rufus pushes Jerry into the coffin

OTIS

Denise starts kicking and fighting with Rufus Rufus
tries to hold her steady when suddenly Mary breaks
free and starts to run

OTIS (CONTD)

(laughs and raises his pistol)

(turns to Mother)
-Ma Otis is having all the fun

MOTHER

OTIS
(rolls his eyes)
Well go get her

Baby jumps with excitement and runs off across the field
after Mary

Mary trips and falls over a small gravestone She gets
up and stumbles back into a wooden cross She tears the
gag from her mouth and gasps for air

BABY

(off screen)
There once was a woman who lived with
her daughter in a cabbage garden

Mary turns toward the voice but sees nothing but wooden
crosses She is in a homemade cemetery

BABY (CONTD)
along came a rabbit and ate up all
the cabbages The woman said

Mary turns 360 degrees but finds nothing

BABY (CONTD)
--Go into the garden and drive out
the rabbit

THUD Mary is hit from behind she falls forward Baby
JUMPS on top of her and sits on her back Baby is
holding a large hunting knife

BABY (CONTD)
Shoo Shoo said the maiden

Mary screams in pain as Baby PLUNGES the knife into
her Baby STABS Mary again and again and again Mary
lets out a long gurgling scream then goes silent

BABY (CONTD)
Come maiden said the rabbit
(leans down)
sit on my tail and go with me to
my rabbit hutch
Baby covered in blood licks the knife clean
EXT PIT - NIGHT

Otis shoves Denise into the coffin with Jerry and locks
the lid shut Through a CROSS-SHAPED OPENING in the
coffin we see them crushed together

Rufus LOWERS the coffin into the pit Once the coffin
is inside Otis slams the door shut

Otis opens a small window in the door and lowers ina
lantern and a small tape recorder playing music

INT PIT - NIGHT

Enter Hell The dim light of the lantern shines off the
slimy wet filth of the rotted wood walls The stench of
death and decay hangs heavy in the thin air

Denise and Jerry cold and shivering hang half submerged
in thick maggot infested sludge Bits of animal and human
skeletons float in the muck broken bones lay in piles
along the walls

INT COFFIN - NIGHT

Through the dim light we see the tightly packed forms
of Jerry and Denise

Suddenly an arm breaks through the side of the coffin
Another smashes through the top of the lid The coffin
begins to violently shake Denise screams

Another reaches through grabbing her feet SMASH The
coffin is ripped apart and Jerry is pulled away from
the destruction

He lets out a quick scream before disappearing into
the darkness

A soft moaning sound is heard coming from the other
end of the pit

DENISE (CONTD)

(moving slowly forward)

Denise cautiously makes her way to the bend at the end
of the tunnel As she approaches the moaning sound
gets louder She turns the corner to see

TWO PALE FIGURES in filthy hospital gowns hunched over
a shadowy object Denise gasps They turn towards

Denise revealing the partially devoured dead body of
Jerry

The two bone-white ghouls are dripping with Jerrys
blood they stare at Denise then return to their prey

Denise screams in horror and runs turning down another
twist in the underground maze She turns the corner

and runs straight into SEVERAL SLOW MOVING GHOULS The
ghouls are of the same deathly white complexion hair-
less with flaked cracking skin Their yellow eyes
shine in the darkness

They reach for her but she breaks free and continues
to run into the endless stretch of tunnels before her

endless tunnels of the pit In the distance she hears
high pitched animal sounds

A GHOUL rises up from the sludge behind Denise It

stands silent It reaches out a BONEY HAND with long
curled fingernails and grabs her hair Denise screams
and tries to pull away The ghoul grabs her with his
other hand and pulls her closer CLAWING at her face

Denise fights her way free but loses her footing and

to the end to find that it is a dead-end Behind her
FIVE GHOULS move silently towards her blocking her
only exit

The ghouls slosh through the muck moving in closer
Denise frantically looks for an escape nailed into
the wall next to her are planks of wood forming a

ladder

The ghouls are only a few yards away Denise climbs
up the ladder They move in clawing at her legs and
feet trying to pull her down Denise digs at the
wood and mud ceiling above her trying to break free

Denise is bleeding severely from the chunks of flesh
being torn from her legs She digs wildly at the
ceiling suddenly a board falls free and mud rains
down to reveal

STARS the sky above shines through the hole Denise
smashes her fists at the rotted wood planks pulling
free another piece

With all her might Denise grabs hold and pulls herself
up through the opening

EXT PIT - NIGHT

Denise fights her way through the earth and pulls her
body up into the night air The cool air rushes to her
lungs She crawls free of the hole gasping for air
She is safe Suddenly SMASH A ghoul has broken
through the surface He grabs Denise by the leg and
begins to pull her back into the hole

Denise screams and begins kicking violently at the
ghoul She breaks and crawls from the ghouls reach
