UNIVERSE - EIGHT BILLION LIGHT YEARS FROM EARTH
The cosmos on the grandest scale we know Clusters of
galaxies strewn like sea froth whorls and smudges of
light representing hundreds of billions of stars each

MILKY WAY GALAXY

A view from the edge We DRIFT ABOVE the majestic
spiraling disk tens of thousands of light years across

RING NEBULA (M57) - CONSTELLATION LYRA

A local group of stars the brightest of which is a point
of hot blue-white light

VEGA

Rings of glowing gas and debris surround the giant blue-
white star and then we notice something ahead of us in
polar orbit

CLOSER

An immense world-sized construct gleams in Vegas blue
light Far too big to be artificial by human standards
-- but this wasnt built to human standards

Bowl-shaped transmitters cover the quicksilver gel-like
surface of the polyhedron forming then vanishing again

We DESCEND INTO one vast bowl as it deepens --

-- then silently convulses A lost chord We SWING
AROUND assuming a breathtaking MOVING POV --

A message begins its journey

SUBTERRANEAN DARKNESS

Shadows appear dark and murky Slowly we become aware of
a MUFFLED PULSING sound like a DISTANT BOOMING

September 8

DISSOLVE

TO
HEARTBEAT

Suddenly a bright light unzips the amniotic darkness two
great hands reach in to assist what we now realize is a
Caesarean birth

ELLIE ARROWAY

age five seconds opens her eyes wide In the bg we
can see a nurse methodically giving CPR to the unseen
mother the decor beyond tells us we are in a small-town
doctors office The DOCTOR holds Ellie as he calls
softly to the nurse

DOCTOR
You can call it Nan Mark time of
birth as 1204 AM
(looking down at the
baby)

Happy New Year little lady
(to the nurse)
Tell Ted he has a girl

TED ARROWAY stands watching through the window in the
office door Numb

front of the short-wave her feet dangling from the stool
He puts his hands on her shoulders

Now in her pajamas Ellie sits hunched over in bed
working intently on her latest masterpiece A crayon

behind her ear

ELLIE
Could we hear to China

TED
On that old shortwave Maybe ona
clear night Come on now under the

ELLIE

Could we hear to the moon

TED
Big enough radio I dont see why
not

ELLIE
Could we hear God

TED
Mmm thats a good one Maybe his
echo

Okay no more stalling

ELLIE

(coloring frantically)
Okay okay there
She hands Ted the drawing As he holds it up to the lamp
we see it shows an idealized beach palm trees It glows
in the light

ELLIE

TED
Thats a beauty Captain
(kisses her on the
forehead)
Now get some sleep

He carefully pins the drawing on the wall turns out the
light As he starts out she says softly --

ELLIE
Do you think therere people on
other planets

Ted pauses smiles at his daughters inexhaustible
curiosity He returns sits on the edge of her bed now
lit by starlight

TED
Well lets see the Universe is a
pretty big place And the one

thing I know about nature is it
hates to waste anything So I guess
Id say if it is just us an awful
lot of space is going to waste

He tenderly brushes a stray lock of her hair behind her
ear

TED
Time to sleep now Captain But you
can ask more questions in the
morning okay

ELLIE
(sighs)
Okay
He kisses her again rises goes to leave stopping at the
door to watch her Ellie looks out the window at the

fridge Mondays and Thursdays say Ellie Cooks

EXT MOUNTAINS - DAY

take a bend in the road --

B) The fawn continues to graze oblivious We can now
hear the RADIO in the DISTANCE

INT ARROWAY KITCHEN - DUSK

The table is set A stubby candle and some wildflowers in
a peanut-butter jar

Ellie sits at her place frowning She glances up at the
wall clock -- and then slowly stands as she sees something
else THROUGH the kitchen window

A sheriffs car is pulling up lights going siren silent

The sheriff looks up -- their eyes meet -- PUSH IN ON

The sheriff stands in front of the house shaking his head
as he talks to a MINISTER VOICES continue to CALL

We start to CRANE UP HIGHER and HIGHER until we clear the

the stars Her fingers grip the shingles

EXT COUNTRY CEMETERY - DAY

The Minister kneels next to Ellie watching her knead
another piece of bread into a ball before tossing it into
a small fish pond In the bg we see the sheriff and
several relatives watching

MINISTER
Im so sorry Ellie More than I
can ever say

Ellie keeps watching the pond The clouds overhead are
reflected in the patches of water between the lily pads

ELLIE
Those lily pads must look like
clouds to that carp dont you
think

The Minister frowns Gently

CUT TO
MINISTER
Ellie this life doesnt last
forever Some day you and your Dad
are going to be together again in

ELLIE
(turns to him
equally gentle)
He isnt in heaven hes in the

Ellie slowly approaches the darkened bench area where the
SHORTWAVE is set up the pin-dotted map above it She
TURNS it ON the dial glows

She reaches out for the microphone holding it tightly in
both hands Pushes the button

We hear the sound of a BUS PULLING UP its door opening
After a moment a pair of sneakered feet tentatively step
INTO FRAME A suitcase is set down next to them as we
hear the BUS WHEEZE OFF into the night A hand reaches

22-YEAR-OLD ELLIE examines it then looks up in
apprehension at the old prewar Spanish structure of Cal
Tech

INT CAMPUS BUILDING - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

walls hung with portraits of Galileo Copernicus Hubble
She pauses at a photograph of Einstein standing outside
the entrance we just saw Sound up cut THE RAMONES I
Wanna Be Sedated --

INT DORM CORRIDOR - NIGHT

An altogether different sort of hallway reflecting the
imagination and individuality of its occupants The walls
are covered with whimsical graffiti (anthropocentrism is
a 17 letter word WATCH FOR FLYING POTATOES) and 3
AM paintings of alien sunsets the MUSIC is coming from
behind a door covered in Tolkien and comic book art

As Ellie enters this strange new world she begins to hear
animated voices coming from a room at the end of the hall

starburst or something

INT DORM ROOM - NIGHT

As Ellie peers around the corner we see six or seven
STUDENTS mostly male of mixed nationality and race
passing around cereal which they eat from the box A
primitive (circa 1980) home-built personal computer glows
in the bg a door opens onto a terrace and the
California night beyond They stop look up at Ellie --

ELLIE
I -- uh --
(clears her throat)
I was looking for Koestler Hall

GUY (STUDENT)
This is it Hey do you know the
average radio-luminosity of an EA
elliptical galaxy

ELLIE
Um Im not sure
(hesitates)
Maybe you could deduce it from
lensing a post-spectral
starburst

GUY
(beat then to his
friend)
See I told you
(to Ellie)

Want some Fruity Pebbles
Carcinogenic but totally worth it

Ellie takes the box and as she tentatively enters the
room -- nibbles on the cereal -- she slowly sits Smiles
The argument rages on Shes home

EXT MOJAVE DESERT - DAY

DAVID DRUMLIN 42 fit sardonic -- and the worlds
foremost radio astronomer -- leads a group of grad
students past the first Jet Propulsion Lab radio
telescopes at Goldstone Ellie lags behind talking to
PETER VALERIAN who is about as good-looking as an
astronomer should be allowed to be

ELLIE
Drumlin said youre been down at
Arecibo for the last year
PETER
Its beautiful but it does get a
little lonely Sometimes I think
the reason we build these things in
such godforsaken places isnt to
avoid excess radio traffic but
because were all such pathetic
antisocial misfits Speaking of
which Howre you getting on with
the old man

ELLIE
Hes an incredible prick but I never
learned so much in my life

PETER
(smiles)
Thats what they all say

In the bg we can see the majestic twin dishes tilted up
toward the hard blue sky An awkward moment which Ellie
fills by extending her hand

ELLIE
Ellie Arroway

PETER
Peter Valerian

ELLIE

Sounds like a Russian general

PETER
Yavol

DRUMLIN
(calling back)
Youre out of shape Valerian
Whats the matter eat too many
tacos down there in Puerto Rico

He pronounces it tackos in his distinctive Montana
twang

ELLIE
I read your paper on ETIs Its
brilliant
PETER
(embarrassed but

pleased)
Keep it down okay Drumlin thinks
Im enough of a flake as it is
(then)
Look -- everyone here has their
little fetishes Caven goes to
topless bars Vernons got his
carnivorous plants mine just
happens to be extraterrestrial
intelligence

ELLIE
What a coincidence It happens to
be my fetish too

A brief but electric moment between them They both feel
it Drumlin calls back from the head of the group

DRUMLIN
You two coming along or you just
gonna do it right here in the sand

The other students laugh good-naturedly Ellie and Peter
rather than being embarrassed seem to be considering the
idea

EXT MOJAVE CLIFFS - LATE AFTERNOON

A dusky orange sun hangs over the mountains the Goldstone
telescopes visible in the distance Ellie and Peter walk
along a windswept cliff overlooking a vast desert lake

ELLIE
Im just so sick of feeling
defensive about the things I care
about Or being lumped in with the
lunatic fringe by people like
Drumlin when if theyd just put
aside their preconceptions for two
seconds and look at the facts

PETER
They cant I think its against
human nature to admit to that level
of insignificance to not see
yourself as basically the center of
the universe

ELLIE
Its like the pre-Copernicans who
swore the sun revolved around the
Earth or the Victorians at the end
of the last century who concluded
that all major discoveries had now
been made I mean try to imagine
civilization a thousand years ahead
of us -- then imagine trying to
explain I dunno a microwave oven
-- to someone even a hundred years
ago -- I mean the basic concepts
didnt exist

PETER
(murmurs)
Any sufficiently advanced

technology
ELLIE
(finishing it with
him)
is indistinguishable from
magic
A moment and then Peter takes her hand like its the
most natural thing in the world
PETER

I dunno I know I should be
objective ice-cold hard-assed
scientific about it but just on an
intuitive level -- whats the point
of a universe so vast if were the
only ones it it Itd just be such
a waste of space

Ellie stops looks at him -- and then slowly carefully
leans in and kisses him A pleasantly awkward beat

ELLIE
Sorry

Peter laughs
EXT DESERT - NIGHT

A million stares blaze overhead as Peter and Ellie make
love on an Indian blanket in the middle of the desert
Ellie looks searchingly up into Peters face and then
her gaze drifts upwards to the canopy above

SQUIRREL
gnaws on a beechnut as two enormous pair of feet walk by

ELLIE (VO)
-- but Ive already submitted my
proposal

EXT CAL TECH CAMPUS - DAY
Ellie and Drumlin walk briskly in heated discussion

DRUMLIN
Im sorry Miss Arroway not only is
it too Speculative a subject for a
doctoral dissertation at this point
in your career itd be tantamount to
suicide

ELLIE
Im willing to take that risk
DRUMLIN
Im not Youre far too promising a
scientist to waste your considerable
gifts on this nonsense --

ELLIE
Dr Drumlin we are talking about
what could potentially be the most
important discovery in the history
of humanity There are over four
hundred billion stars out there --

DRUMLIN
And only two probabilities One
there is intelligent life in the
universe but theyre so far away
youll never contact it in your
lifetime --

ELLIE
Youre --

DRUMLIN
Two Theres nothing out there but
noble gasses and carbon compounds
and youd be wasting your time

ELLIE

What if youre wrong

(as he starts to

speak)
No -- Ill grant you probabilities
but as a scientist without all the
evidence -- you cant deny the
possibility -- and I believe even
the remotest possibility of
something this profoundly
profound is worth investigation --
and worth taking a few risks

DRUMLIN
I disagree

ELLIE
Then disagree but dont stand in my
way

By this point theyve gathered a small crowd

regards her for for a moment then

softly

Drumlin

DRUMLIN
What is it that makes you so lonely
Miss Arroway What is it that
compels you to search the heavens
for life when theres so much of it
being neglected right here at home
Body blow Ellie just stares stunned Finally

DRUMLIN
I will approve a general thesis on
the detection of radio signals from
space but thats all No ETIs
Enough

Flushed overwhelmed Ellie nods Enough

I keep telling myself okay
thats just the price you have to
do your time doing shitwork before
youre allowed to get to the good
stuff but if I have to catalog
one more quasar
(sticks her head
out)

God Ive missed you

PETER
Any luck on the grant money

ELLIE
Please Any chance of that died the
day David Drumlin was appointed head
of the NSF I have been in
contact with a few other SETI
people weve been trying to find
backing from private investors
Ive even managed to scrounge a
couple of hours of telescope time
here and there

PETER
And

ELLIE
Ive examined over forty stars of
roughly solar spectral type but so
far nothing Still weve barely
started

Peter is silent
EXT MT ARECIBO (PUERTO RICO) - DAY

Ellie and Peter walk along the periphery of the vast
concave dish A gentle breeze blows

ELLIE
Weve been going after some of
the big multi-nationals but without
much luck got a donation from a New
York dowager Weve even been
thinking about selling T-shirts

PETER
Ellie even if you do manage to
raise the money have you thought
about what it would really mean to
follow through on this I mean a
college fetish is one thing but
were talking about your career
You wont be publishing You wont
be taken seriously and you could
spend your entire life looking and
never find anything at all

Ellie pauses looks out at the endless ocean of green
Quietly
ELLIE
If we lived at any previous time in
human history we wouldnt even have
the option of failing -- wed have
to wonder our whole lives unable to
do anything about it This time
right now is unique in our history
in any civilizations history -- the
moment of the acquisition of
technology The moment when contact
becomes possible Weve already
beaten incredible odds by being
lucky enough to be alive now

PETER
(pausing)
How close are you to getting this
funding put together

ELLIE
Its almost there The hardest part
is getting someone to sell us the
telescope time

PETER
What if I said I could get Drumlin
to agree to sell you time in New
Mexico

ELLIE
(stunned)
The VLA

PETER
Thirty-one linked dishes You could
search more sky there in a day than
you could in a year here

ELLIE
Peter -- if you can get him to do
that for me hed obviously do the
same for you -- we could --

PETER
Actually --

ELLIE

We could be together again --

PETER
-- Im moving to Washington

ELLIE
(confused)
Greenbank

PETER
Im going on staff at the NSF To
work for Drumlin

ELLIE
But what about your research --

PETER
This is a chance to be of enormous
help to other peoples research --
to have the power to be a real
advocate where Davids got blind
spots --

ELLIE
But the work --

PETER
The work Jesus Ellie cant
there just once be more to life than
the work Okay maybe thats the
only way to get the recognition win
the prizes --

ELLIE
Please youre just as ambitious as
I am more --

PETER
Maybe thats the problem I want
a family Ellie I want kids A
townhouse on L street instead of
still living like a college kid A
real life Maybe that makes me a
sellout but I dont care anymore
Its what I want

ELLIE

And you think I dont want those
things You think I dont stay up
half the night wondering if Ive
made the right choice living half a
world away from you wondering if
any of this is worth what Im giving
up for it everyday

(as Peter is silent

suddenly)
Lets get married

PETER
Jesus -—

ELLIE
Right now -- well drive down to

Ramey and get the base chaplain to
marry us

PETER
Ellie --

ELLIE
Im serious about this Peter --

PETER

silence)
Her names Laura She came up to
Owens Valley to do her post-doc
about six months after you left

ELLIE
(stares)
You sonofabitch

PETER
That is true But its also true
that if I really thought we wanted
the same things Id follow you

anywhere but the truth is I dont
think you want the company
(softly)

Be honest El Theres nowhere
youd rather be than sitting out at
some remote corner of the world
searching for the answers to the
mysteries of the universe And call
me crazy but I just cant compete
with that Im sorry

Now exactly Its complicated

ELLIE

DRUMLIN
(a beat then)
Ellie

ELLIE

(avoiding the

inevitable)
Did I tell you weve expanded the
search spectrum Were including
several other possible magic
frequencies -- not just the hydrogen
line anymore I was trying to get
inside their heads yknow And I
started thinking what other
constants are there in the Universe
besides hydrogen and then suddenly
it was so obvious -- transcendantals
right So weve been trying
variations of pi

DRUMLIN
You know why Im here

ELLIE
Its not enough having my search
time systematically cut down -- you
know Im down to three hours a week
now

DRUMLIN
Ellie I should have done this a
long time ago certainly before I
left the NSF but I wanted to
give you every benefit of the
doubt --

ELLIE
You cant just pull the plug David
DRUMLIN
Its not like youve given me much
choice

ELLIE
Meaning

DRUMLIN
Meaning I have to go defend a budget
to the President and to Congress and
youre out here listening to washing
machines

ELLIE
(quietly)
Im searching for patterns in the
noise thats all Order in the
chaos Im practicing listening --

DRUMLIN
The point is this isnt just
scientific inquiry anymore -- its

turned into some kind of personal
obsession

ELLIE
The difference being what -- that I
refuse to adopt the standard line
that I dont care about the results
of my work Well I do care Of
course any discovery has to be
verifiable of course it must be
subject to all rigors of scientific
method but I refuse to go around
pretending Im some kind of
dispassionate automaton when its
obvious to anyone with a brain Im
just not

DRUMLIN
No Youre not But the price has
just gotten too high

ELLIE

Goddamnit they are out there
David --

DRUMLIN
Then why havent you detected any
signals If as you claim there
have been thousands millions of
advanced civilizations out there for
millions of years then why hasnt
one signal gotten through
(rising)
Itll take a month or two for the
paperwork to go through youre
welcome to stay until then

with no results and now yesterday
they start broadcasting primes
Why

ELLIE
Its hardly yesterday the signals
been traveling for over twenty-six

find out -- to see if theres
another message buried deeper in the

Oh and if you could ask them not to
use their radios -- interference
Thanks so much

Drumlin warns her with a look which she conveniently
avoids

KITZ
Ill come right to the point
Doctor Your sending this message
all over the world may well be a
breach of National Security

ELLIE
This isnt a person to person call
Mr Kitz I dont really think the
civilization sending the message
intended it just for Americans

KITZ
Im saying you might have consulted
us the contents of this message
could be extremely sensitive

ELLIE
You want to classify prime numbers

DRUMLIN

Mike because of the Earths
rotation were only in line with
Vega so many hours a day the only
way to get the whole message is to
cooperate with other stations If
Dr Arroway hadnt moved quickly we
could have lost key elements

Okay fine theyve got the primes
-- but if youre right about there
being another more significant
transmission still to come --

they then sent back to us hugely

proves harmless we can discuss
sharing it with the rest of the

problem we dont have the means to
receive all the data on our own

In the air under the sea in the
depths of DNA itself Hadden
Industries is at the frontier

Ellie chin on forearms stares at her screen willing
herself to find a pattern

Suddenly she blinks -- something is changing A dot
appears in the middle of the screen It begins to grow
revealing a complex fractal shape It splits enlarges
splits again the shapes finally revealing themselves
as English letters Which read

TAKE ME TO YOUR LEADER
Ellie stares --
ELLIE

Someones broken into the system
someones compromised the
fucking --

She quickly type in Who are you

The fractals reform IVE GOT A SECRET

Ellie types again WHO ARE YOU

The fractals reform YOUR PLACE OR MINE

Ellie stares -- more fractals form as she grabs a pen and
paper --

EXT VLA - NIGHT

National Guardsmen have established a perimeter around the
compound soldiers are posted on the main road as well

As Ellie ROARS through the gate in her 1967 T-BIRD our
VIEW RISES the new Woodstock nation is for the moment
asleep

EXT HIGHWAY (NEW MEXICO) - NIGHT
Ellies tense face lit by the dash She picks up a piece
of paper with scribbled directions on it Turns onto a

dirt road

EXT HIGHWAY (NEW MEXICO) - LOW ANGLE POV - NIGHT

(VO)
of Ellies CAR ROARING by SWINGS to reveal a jackrabbit
sitting at the side of the road its nose twitching

EXT DESERT - NIGHT

Ellies car approaches a small private airstrip a black
unmarked helicopter is waiting

HIGH ABOVE UTAH - DAWN

The strange rock formations of southeastern Utah almost
resemble another planet

EXT LARGER AIRSTRIP (UTAH)

As the helicopter sets down we see two Lear jets and
another Helicopter service vehicles for the enormous
Russian transport plane that sits beyond them

A dark-suited Japanese MAJOR DOMO helps Ellie out of the
helicopter

MAJOR DOMO
You should be flattered He hardly
lands for anyone

INT TRANSPORT PLANE

The Major Domo leads Ellie down a corridor of the planes
custom interior Through one door we can see into a room
where several very beautiful very young women sit
watching TV with vacant eyes Ellie only catches a
glimpse before the Major Domo nods for her to enter the
main room and takes his post outside

Ellie cautiously enters the interior of what appears to be
a flying Dascha dark heavy on the chintz Bookshelves

an exercise machine and a wall of monitors filled top

to bottom with scrolling hieroglyphics Ellie reaches out
to them --

HADDEN (0OS)
Dr Arroway I presume

Ellie turns to see SR HADDEN Thick glasses wearing a
cardigan he stands by a silver samovar

ELLIE
SR Hadden
(beat)
You compromised our security codes

HADDEN
Once upon a time I was a hell of an
engineer Please sit Doctor I
have guests so rarely its
important to me they feel welcome in
my home

(turns to the

samovar)
Did you know this was once Yeltsins
flying dascha That dent is where
he threw a bottle of vodka at the
pilot At least thats what the
people who sold me the plane said

As he speaks he slowly and with great effort raises a
glass to the samovar fills it with tea

ELLIE
You live here

HADDEN
I find it convenient to keep my
interests mobile Anyway Ive

had my fill of life on the ground
After spending much of this century
pursuing the evils and pleasures the

world has to offer -- after
outliving three wives and two
children

(a bare flicker of
emotion)
I find Ive had quite enough of
planet Earth

ELLIE
Why am I here Mr Hadden

HADDEN
(smiles)
The infamous unfashionable
bluntness
(turning)

Youre here so we can do business
I want to make a deal

ELLIE
What kind of deal

HADDEN

The powers that be have been quite
busy lately falling over each other
to position themselves for the game
of the century if not the
millennium Perhaps youve noticed

(as Ellie reacts

Hadden smiles)
Perhaps I could help deal you back
in

ELLIE
I didnt realize I was out
The lights dim

HADDEN

Oh maybe not out -- but definitely
looking for you coat

(beat)
I understand youve had some
difficulty locating the -- what are

you calling it The primer that

will make decryption possible
(he turns to her
simply)

Ive found it

ELLIE
Youve found it
(catching her breath)
What could I possibly have that you
would want Mr Hadden

HADDEN
Ive had a long time to make
enemies Dr Arroway There are
many governments business
interests even religious leaders
who would like to see me disappear
And I will grant them their wish
soon enough But before I do I
wish to make a small contribution --
a final gesture of goodwill toward
the people of this little planet
whove given -- from whom Ive taken
so much

ELLIE
f I knew you any better Id say
at doesnt sound like you

aH

HADDEN
(a dazzling smile)
Thats my girl
(then)

Lights
The wall monitors take center stage
HADDEN

Forgive the theatrics its a
weakness

Hadden pulls on a pair of gloves for an imaginary VR
keyboard He gestures for Ellie to sit beside him facing

the monitors

He begins to type as the monitors scroll

hieroglyphics --

HADDEN
Page after page of data -- over
sixty-three thousand in all if Im
not mistaken and at the end of
each

ELLIE
A page-break signal A period

HADDEN
Not if you think like a Vegan

ELLIE
Youre saying there is no
separate primer in the message --
because its on every page so the
recipient can decipher it wherever

he is --

HADDEN
-- even if he doesnt receive the
entire transmission Heaven is the

mustard seed

Hadden ghost-types a series of commands The monitor wall
syncs into a giant vidscreen --

The hieroglyphics begin to enlarge An almost invisible
dot in the lower right corner of the screen -- the page-
break signal -- grows larger and larger until it reveals
a level of complexity and detail greater than that of the
hieroglyphics themselves

ELLIE
(breathless)
Holy shit
These new symbols begin to mutate change something is
happening Hadden leans in to Ellie
HADDEN
Youll like this part A little

flashy
ON SCREEN

The symbols metamorphose into strange fractal shapes
like crystals they begin to grow and shift interacting
in a stunningly beautiful and intricate ballet --

ELLIE
Some kind of circuitry

HADDEN
Very good Doctor Ive also
detected structural elements back
references a general movement from
the simple to the complex -- all of
which would seem to indicate
instructions -- an enormously
complicated set of instructions --
for building something

ELLIE
A machine
(off Haddens nod)
But a machine that does what

HADDEN

(smiles)
That would seem to be the question
of the hour

(turning to her)
I want to build it Doctor Of
course Im already lobbying through
the usual channels of influence and

corruption -- but as I said my
colorful past has made many of those
channels difficult to navigate

I need someone on the inside

ELLIE
And in return
HADDEN
In return you get the primer --

and with it the power to stay in the
game Do we have a deal

Ellie pulls herself away from the hypnotic display

ELLIE
Mr Hadden Im a scientist I dont
make deals But If you wish to

give me in good faith access to
your information I can assure you
that I will exert all reasonable
efforts to promote your cause
wherever it doesnt conflict with
the best interests of science or
my better judgment

HADDEN
(delighted)
Thats my girl Done

Ellie turns to watch the screens as the fractals continue
to coalesce Dazzled --

CUT TO
EXT CAMP DAVID - AERIAL SHOT - DAY

The snow-covered Presidential retreat in its forest
setting

INT CAMP DAVID - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
Charts display a decoded periodic table the slice of
circuitry monitors scroll through hundreds of decoded
pages

ELLIE
And while its function remains
for the moment a mystery my best
guess is that it represents a
transport of some kind

PRESIDENT LASKER
A transport So are they coming or
are we going

KITZ
(interrupting)

The transport theory is only one
hypothesis Ms President and in my
view a rather naive one It could
just as easily be some kind of
Trojan Horse We build it and out
pours the entire Vegan army

CHAIRMAN OF JOINT CHIEFS
Why even bother to risk personnel
Why not send some kind of doomsday
machine Every time an emerging
technological civilization announces
itself by broadcasting radio waves
into space they reply with a
message The civilization builds it
and blows itself up No
expeditionary force needed

ELLIE
Ms President this is communist
paranoia right out of War of the
Worlds There is no reason
whatsoever to believe the ETIs
intentions are hostile We pose no
threat to them -- it would be like
us going out of our way to destroy
microbes on a beach in Africa

DRUMLIN
Interesting analogy And how guilty
would we feel if we happened to
destroy some microbes on a beach in
Africa

KITZ
(turning to Ellie)
I hope youre right Doctor But
right now my job is to protect
American lives from any plausible
threat and in that regard I have to
assume the worst

RICHARD RANK
From a non-secular perspective Im
forced to agree

All heads turn to RICHARD RANK a surprisingly young and
well-spoken spokesman for the religious right

RANK

My coalitions phone lines have been
flooded with calls from concerned
families wondering if this message
signifies the end of the world or
the advent of the rapture

(smiles)
We feel that US policy in this
matter wants to be extremely
conservative -- if theres any
chance of danger or threat to our
way of life perhaps the message and
its contents should simply be
disregarded

ELLIE
This is absurd

Drumlin shoots her a warning look Rank ignores her

RANK
e Bible states that God made man
n His own image From everything

ve been told its highly unlikely
e creatures who sent this message
esemble human beings in any way
ape or form ergo they are not of
God and therefore by definition
evil My constituents simply want
to know what their government plans
to do to protect them --

ORtHEA

ELLIE

Ms President forgive me but I
thought this was to be a serious
discussion of policy and technical
issues not a war council against
Satans minions --

PRESIDENT LASKER
Mr Ranks organization represents
the point of view of tens of
millions of families Dr Arroway
Feel free to disagree but there
wont be any suppressing of opinions
here today

ELLIE
Yes -- of course -- all Im saying
is this message was written in the
language of science -- mathematics
-- and was clearly intended to be
received by scientists If it had
been religious in nature it should
have taken the form of a burning
bush or a booming voice from the
sky

JOSS (OS)
But a voice from the sky is just
what you say youve found

Palmer Joss sits forward in his chair

JOSS
I agree with Mr Rank that there are
unavoidable religious implications
here -- but I dont think it
justifies taking an alarmist
position Dr Arroway is right --
their chosen means of communication
was a scientific one anda
scientific approach is probably
appropriate at least until the
theological dimensions of the
problem become more apparent

ELLIE
And where exactly does that put your
position

JOSS

Id have to say I dont know enough
to have one yet For the moment I
dont believe the two approaches
have to be mutually exclusive

Ellie looks at him impressed in spite of herself

PRESIDENT LASKER
Whats the status of the decryption
effort

ELLIE
Well --

DRUMLIN
Were continuing around the clock
but the amount of data is enormous
Its difficult to tell when well
find the key that will tell us the
machines purpose -- maybe tomorrow
maybe next year maybe never

PRESIDENT LASKER
I want to know the minute you find
anything

DRUMLIN
Of course Ms President Well
keep you fully informed

Thats the cue most of the gathered begin to rise make
their way to the door As Ellie collects her things
Drumlin accompanies her out -- then starts to shut the
door behind her --

DRUMLIN
The President wants to discuss a few
matters in private

As Ellie looks beyond she sees that Kitz the Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs and Joss still remain

ELLIE
But --

But its too late The door closes on the inner circle
INT NATIONAL SCIENCE MUSEUM - RECEPTION - NIGHT

Captains of industry social editors minority leaders
At least for tonight scientists are the hottest show in
town

Ellie stands with a group of dignitaries straining to
make small talk As she glances up a familiar face
catches her eye Peter Valerian

He looks up sees her too A beat he whispers
something to the young woman hes standing with she looks
up too They excuse themselves to Drumlin make their way
over

PETER
Ellie

ELLIE
Peter

Peter extends his hand They shake

PETER
My wife Laura

ELLIELAURA
Nice to meet you

PETER

(an awkward pause

then)
You look wonderful
ELLIE
You dress up pretty good yourself
(another awkward
silence)
Hows the baby

LAURA
Wonderful Shes almost four now

ELLIE
Really Well Thats wonderful
(a really horrible

silence)
Well If youll excuse me -- Im
paid to mingle I dont believe I

just said that

Peter and Laura laugh Some of the tension is diffused
Some

PETER
Its good to see you Ellie

ELLIE
You too

She manages a smile quickly hurries away
AT THE BAR
Ellie has never needed a drink more in her life

ELLIE
Champagne please

JOSS (0S)
Make that two

Ellie turns to find Joss looking terrific in his tux

JOSS
Want to fight some more

A long extremely complex pause then --

ELLIE
Yes

INT ANOTHER PART OF MUSEUM - NIGHT

Their voices and FOOTSTEPS ECHO as they walk past old
spacecraft They sip their champagne

JOSS
What Im curious about are the
wilderness years Youre out there
all alone no money mocked by the
skeptics It must have taken
tremendous faith

ELLIE
Id say logic more than faith The
odds were on my side

JOSS
And what would you have done if the
odds had gone against you

ELLIE
I guess I wouldve felt sorry for
the universe

JOSS
Spoken like a true believer

ELLIE
What about you Doesnt all of this
shake your faith at all

JOSS
How do you mean

ELLIE
Well its been a while but I dont
recall the Bible saying too much
about alien civilizations

JOSS
(thinks then)
My fathers house has many
mansions

ELLIE
Very smooth Its Palmer right
Where I came from a palmer was a
person who cheated at cards

(as Joss laughs)

Really though the Bible describes
a God who watches over one tiny
world a few thousand years old I
look out there and see a universe of
hundreds of billions of galaxies
each with hundreds of billions of
stars I mean burn me for a
heretic but your God seems awfully
small

Joss looks at her -- challenged intrigued Slowly

JOSS
Who was it who said -- it was a
scientist I think -- that ones
sophistication is determined by the
ability to tolerate paradox -- to
hold contradictory ideas at the same
time

They approach a circular brass railing surrounding a
circular mosaic below at its center is a Foucault
pendulum a basketball-sized iron sphere suspended from
the ceiling They lean on the railing

JOSS
which I suppose is as good a
definition of faith as any
(getting an idea
smiles)
Care to test yours

He takes her champagne glass sets it down on the floor
alongside his then climbs under the rail At her
surprise --

JOSS
Its okay Im a preacher

He offers her his hand She takes it climbs under the
railing Joss helps her down into the circular space
below

JOSS
Your faith tells you that the
distance a pendulum swings from the
vertical can never get bigger only
smaller

ELLIE
Thats not faith its physics The
second law of thermodynamics

Joss places his arms around the metal ball and walks it
over to the outer rim of the circle right in front of
Ellies nose

JOSS
And you believe this law with all
your heart and soul

ELLIE
And mind yes What are you --

JOSS
So if I let the pendulum go when it
swings back you wouldnt flinch

Ellie pauses Then almost curiously

ELLIE
No
Joss lets go We see the ball fall away and reach the
opposite railing As it slows and then reverses direction
it appears to approach much faster than we expected

JOSS
Dont lean forward Not even a
hair

As it careens towards her the ball grows alarmingly in
size We understand completely when the pendulum almost
reaches her and she instinctively moves But Ellie cant
believe it

ELLIE
I flinched

JOSS
Only a tiny bit Even the most
devout believer is allowed a little
doubt

ELLIE
Thats not doubt Thats four
hundred years of science fighting a
billion years of instinct
(studying him)
I always wondered what you religious
types did with your free time

JOSS
Now you know

EXT NATIONAL SCIENCE MUSEUM - NIGHT

Stars shine down as Ellie and Joss walk along the portico
The party continues inside The mood is subdued
intimate

JOSS

» Its an old story I grew up in
South Boston more or less on the
streets By the time I was thirteen
Id tried my first hit of heroin by
fifteen Id stopped using but I was
dealing full-time By the time I
was nineteen I decided I didnt want
to live any more at least not ina
world like that One day I got ona
bus I got as far as Ohio before my
money ran out and after that I just
kept walking Didnt eat didnt

sleep just walked I ended up
collapsing in a wheat field There
was a storm I woke up

(beat)

And thats about as far as wordsll
go
ELLIE
Can you try

JOSS
I had an experience Of
belonging Of unconditional love
And for the first time in my life I
wasnt terrified and I wasnt
alone

ELLIE
(delicately)
And theres no chance you had this
experience simply because some part
of you needed to have it

JOSS
Look Im a reasonable person and
reasonably intelligent But this
experience went beyond both For
the first time I had to consider the
possibility that intellect as
wonderful as it is is not the only
way of comprehending the universe
That it was too small and inadequate
a tool to deal with what it was
faced with

ELLIE
(a beat then
softly)
You may not believe this but

eres a part of me that wants more
an anything to believe in your

od To believe that were all here
or a purpose that all this

eans something But its because
at part of me wants it so badly

at Im so stubborn about making
ure it isnt just self-delusion

f course I want to know God if

ere is one but it has to be
real Unless I have proof how can I
be sure

toudct sas haatc

JOSS
Do you love your parents

ELLIE
(startled)
I never knew my mother My father
died when I was nine

JOSS
Did you love him
ELLIE
(softly)
Yes Very much

JOSS
Prove it

Ellie stops and looks at him truly disarmed

And then inside a COMMOTION is heard

INT NATIONAL SCIENCE MUSEUM - NIGHT

The party is suddenly and dramatically breaking up
Senators on cell-phones getting their coats Something
has happened Ellie finds Drumlin in the chaos also on a

cell-phone he hangs up as she approaches

ELLIE
What is it Whats happened

DRUMLIN
Weve cracked it Lunacharsky found
it

ELLIE
You mean --

DRUMLIN

You were right Ellie You were
right all along

ELLIE

looks up in surprise The applause grows becoming
deafening People motion for her to stand Dazed she
does so The ovation continues Ellie leans over to
speak into her mike

ELLIE

Im here with Peter Valerian
recently named David Drumlins
replacement as Science Advisor to
the President Doctor there were
loud complaints from the
international community last week
when it was announced that three of

the ten candidates -- were to be
Americans How do you defend that
decision

PETER

(a bit nervous)
I believe the response was somewhat
disingenuous when it was determined
that national interests would be
represented on a pay for play basis
it was understood that the US by
shouldering close to one third of
the financial burden would be
entitled to commensurate
representation

tell there arent any provisions in

RUSSIAN CANDIDATE
Based on what evidence As far as
we know all they know about us is
what theyve learned from watching

inadvertently Look at the impact
theyve had on the world by simply

were not looking at this from
their point of view Its the first
time this has happened to us but
its highly unlikely thats true for
them as well Chances are theyve
been doing this for thousands if not
millions of years

SAME - REAL TIME

DRUMLIN
They knew our level of development
If as you say theyve done this
many times theyd be well aware of
the implications

CUT TO
ELLIE
Maybe they are Maybe this is all
part of the package The building
of the machine has demanded
international cooperation on an
unprecedented scale Maybe
requiring us to come together in
this way was in effect part of the
plan

JEAN-CLAUDE
Very well Assume this is true
Assume they have only the best of
intentions Suppose they decide to
just step in and solve all our
problems for us You have no
objection to them so flagrantly
intervening in human affairs

INT MAIN TESTING HANGER (MACHINE TEXAS) - DAY

The vast hanger serves as home for a series of new labs
and testing areas -- state of the art gleaming and high-
tech Engineers scientists security and technicians
wearing blue jumpsuits and security badges are everywhere

FEMALE PA VOICE (VO)
Component test C-4-90 commencing in
T-minus three minutes All
personnel clear bay twelve repeat
clear bay twelve --

We FIND Ellie Drumlin and the rest huddled around a
large monitor Also present is TEAM LEADER -- cool
level-headed solid The ultimate line producer

TEAM LEADER
This just came in from systems

integrations in Hokkaido

He presses play The monitor shows a large apparently
empty lucite chamber A clock showing tenths and
hundredths of a second is inset into the screen

TEAM LEADER
The chamber contains an exotic
substance manufactured according to
message specifications In its
normal state it appears as you see
it a transparent gas which is
apparently breathable As youll
see it also has some other
unusual properties

A Japanese technician places his hand inside a waldo
picks up a REVOLVER He aims it into the chamber
FIRES --

-- as then we see the bullet slow coming to a dead stop
in mid-air We see the same thing again this time in
slow motion As we watch the air in the chamber seems to
thicken around the bullet changing from a gas to liquid
from gel-like colloidal to diamond-hard solid in a tenth
of a second

TEAM LEADER
The substance appears to have
intelligent multiphasic properties
able to shift states at will We
believe it may function as some sort
of transport medium

DRUMLIN
Now I know why the Japanese gave up
having a candidate in exchange for
licensing rights

ELLIE
How does it work

TEAM LEADER
We have no idea According to all
known physical laws it shouldnt

ELLIE
(murmurs)
Magic

TEAM LEADER
(looks at her then)

What you havent seen is what
occurred when a technician went into
the chamber to retrieve the
bullet As I said the substance
had already been deemed breathable
after extensive tests on laboratory
animals
DRUMLIN
What happened

The Team Leader pushes play We see the action as he
describes it

TEAM LEADER
There was apparently an aqueous
residue covering part of the chamber
floor The technician slips As he
falls the substance hardens around
him breaking his fall

We see the technician as his fall slows -- and then he
suddenly convulses -- and then stops suspended at an odd
angle slightly above the ground He doesnt move Ellie
Drumlin and the other candidates watch in horror

TEAM LEADER
» and solidifying in his lungs and
bloodstream killing him instantly

ELLIE
(shaken)
Maybe maybe it was an anomalous
reaction Maybe when its correctly
integrated with other components of
the machine

She looks again to the eerie sight of the suspended dead
technician Team Leader snaps off the monitor

TEAM LEADER
Maybe Unfortunately thats all we
have is maybes increasing
exponentially every day This
machine is now building itself as
much as were building it Almost
as if its growing evolving

They all take this in then instinctively look out the
hanger doors at the structure taking shape in the field
beyond now rising to a height of twelve stories We PUSH
IN ON it

TEAM LEADER (0S)
Its scary folks Were like
cavemen building a nuclear warhead
We are constructing the most
advanced dangerously powerful
whateveritis in the history of the
planet and we dont have a fucking
clue how were doing it

You have a question Dr Arroway

ELLIE
I question the thinking behind
sending the first ambassador to
another civilization in armed --
basically announcing our intentions
are hostile

PROJECT OFFICIAL
Its designed purely as a defensive
device Call it a reasonable
precaution

ELLIE
Call it xenophobic paranoia Dont
you see the absolute absurdity of
this This isnt about them its
about us -- our violence our fear
and mistrust --

PROJECT OFFICIAL

Dr Arroway you are entitled to

your opinion But we feel quite
strongly that it would by both
irresponsible and naive to senda
human being into a completely

unknown completely uncontrollable
situation absolutely defenseless

ELLIE
Yknow what Fine I guess if we
want them to know the truth about
who we are theres no quicker way to
show them

Theyre saying the machine is alive

ELLIE
Not exactly It has organic
qualities but we dont really
understand how theyre integrated
with the mechanical systems

JOSS
Maybe youre creating a monster

ELLIE
I dont think so

JOSS
Why

ELLIE
Its too elegant The degree of
economy is extraordinary its
really the next logical step Even

on Earth technology has always
aspired to a condition of nature
DNA outclasses any computer we
can come up with the human body is
the most exquisitely designed
machine imaginable

JOSS
In other words God is one hell of
an engineer

more time even if you traveled

near the speed of light when you
came back --

ELLIE
If you came back

JOSS
(after a beat)
If you came back youd only be
four years older -- but over 50
years would have passed on Earth

ELLIE
Something like that

JOSS
And everybody you care about would
be dead and buried

Ellie looks up at him

She looks away

ELLIE
If you came back If you survived
at all Which its pretty certain
you wouldnt

aimed at the only thing thats
given it a sense of purpose

ELLIE
Im more interested in the story
behind the story How a young man

goes from living on the streets of
South Boston to being the best-
selling media figure rubbing elbows
with the President

JOSS
(after a pause)
I wont deny I was ambitious When
I had my experience I wanted
to tell my story to as many people
as possible Im the first to admit
Now its Joss
softly

that process included making some
compromises

(still seems

troubled then)
You didnt answer my question

ELLIE
I thought it was well-written
Heart-felt And a little bit
naive But thats just the enemys
perspective

JOSS
I dont consider you the enemy
Ellie Im not ‘out to get
technology I only ask the
question Does it have to have all
the answers I look out there and I
see so much emptiness People are
so starved for meaning and its
something they just dont seem to be
getting from science

ELLIE
Did you ever stop to think that
maybe that isnt sciences fault
but meanings

JOSS
I dont follow

ELLIE
(quietly)
Maybe the reason people are having
trouble finding meaning isnt
because science has obscured it
maybe its just revealed it isnt
there

turn to be disarmed He looks at her

JOSS
Do you really believe your life is
meaningless

ELLIE
(looking away)
I dont know But as a scientist I
have to consider that possibility

JOSS
And yet youre willing to die for
this cause the one thing thats
given your life a sense of purpose
Dont you see the contradiction

(reading from her

Another question I would ask
would be a very simple one How did
you do it How did you evolve as
far as you have and not destroy
yourselves
JOSS
An excellent question Doctor But
what if we dont like the answer

ELLIE
How do you mean

JOSS
What if their answer is Oh thats
easy A thousand years ago our
world was in terrible shape our
population out of control violent
crime no food so we called a
general council and decided to
eliminate the anit-social The
weak The sick The unwanted And
ever since weve been doing great

I think Reverend Joss raises an
excellent point I believe we

should discuss the formation of a

panel to review any potentially
delicate communications before am

I amusing you Dr Arroway

Ellie is smiling grimly to herself shaking her head

ELLIE
You kill me you really do The
first truly global a-political
event in history and you cant wait
to spin it

PROJECT OFFICIAL
How would you propose we handle it
Doctor

ELLIE
I guess Id say I trust us enough to
believe our response would be
something to the effect of thanks
for the advice but no thanks But
to dilute or censor the truth for
whatever reason --

PROJECT OFFICIAL
Nobody is proposing we censor the
truth here Doctor Were simply
talking about putting a mechanism in
place --

ELLIE
For managing the truth But the
truth wont be managed sir It
stops being the truth the moment you
try
OFF Joss --
SAME SCENE - LATER

Ellie is making her final prepared remarks to the
committee

ELLIE
I dont claim to be a perfect
example of the human species far

from it But I think paradoxically
thats my strength as a candidate
Because I think we need to share the
truth of who we are with them -- our
strengths --

Her eyes suddenly fall on Joss looking at her from his
seat on the panel A timeless beat --

ELLIE
-- and our weaknesses To go to
them openly nakedly and say these
are our dreams these are our fears
What Im saying ladies and
gentlemen is that I believe we
should make this journey with
honesty and integrity or not at all

The words are spoken with passion and conviction but
something tells us this isnt playing in Peoria Ellie
looks uncertain

Ladies and gentlemen I come to you
today not only as a scientist but
as a politician -- an occupation
for which I make no apologies
With all due respect to Doctor
Arroways talk of naked honesty and
integrity -- high ideals to be
sure -- I believe it would be
foolish and in fact dangerous to
ignore the fact that what we are
dealing with here is a political
situation -- the most political of
situations -- and one that must be
examined in that context

selecting will play a crucial role
in humanitys future I believe
that when this person comes back --
if they come back -- they will be
seen as being anointed by a higher
intelligence and may well emerge as
one of the most important people on
Earth It may be true that Eleanor
Arroway is not a perfect human being
-- but I believe her honesty her
purity and her integrity to be
unimpeachable Ms President --

HADDEN

gantry-enveloped sphere surrounded by hundreds of ant-
like technicians

A second machine

HADDEN

As each component was tested and
shipped off to Texas a duplicate was
maintained and assembled in Hokkaido
-- for backup purposes of course
Weve been right behind you the
entire time

(as Ellie is stunned)
You see my problem I couldnt
appear to control too large a

stand for it So I simply made sure
the Japanese consortium received the
systems integration contract Of

it to her She takes it looks at him quizzically

During the crusades -- pilgrims who
made the journey to the holy land
brought back a palm frond to show
theyd actually been there I
thought it sort of made sense that
Earth is now your holy land so

just a little bit terrified about

Its a very good kiss

Originally just another species like
yourselves Well not like you at
all actually but

ELLIE
Can you show me

TED
Small moves Captain small moves

ELLIE
Why did you contact us

TED
You contacted us We were simply
listening Weve been listening for
millions of years

ELLIE
And those other docking ports I
saw I mean there are others
TED
Many others
ELLIE

And they all travel here through
this wormhole subway system you
built

TED
Oh we didnt build it The transit
system has been in place for
billions of years were just its
caretakers

ELLIE
So who

TED
We dont know Whoever they were
they were gone long before we ever
got here
ELLIE
The scale its just
(catching her breath)
So all the civilizations you detect
they all end up coming here

TED
Not all Some choose to stay at
home and dream their dreams
(sadly)
Some never make it this far

ELLIE
So we passed some kind of test

TED
You have your mothers hands
(beat)
There are no tests Ellie We dont
sit in judgment Think of us more

as librarians Curators of the
Universes rarest and most valuable
creation

And now they are walking through a familiar forest
Sunlight streams through the tall trees

As many civilizations as weve
found compared to the vastness of
space

He seems momentarily overcome with a terrible sadness
and then he recovers smiles

TED
life is unspeakably rare So
whenever we do find another
civilization especially one
thats struggling We senda
message Sometimes we can offer
help Sometimes we cant But we
always try Life is simply too
precious not to

ELLIE
Can you help us

Ted hesitates They are now standing in the middle of a
vast alien desert stretching to the horizon The dome of
the sky darkens revealing a view from outside the galaxy
the Milky Way hangs like a pinwheel in the blackness of

Youre an interesting species an

exquisite dreams such horrifying
nightmares Technologically youve
advanced very quickly -- some think
too quickly and yet

really dont want the company

Peter shakes his head -- then begins to melt morph into

JOSS
What does it feel like to understand
everything in the universe except
yourself

-- the Texas meadow instantly dissolves behind him to
become the darkness of the Hokkaido night --

JOSS
Ellie there is no reason you have
to be alone

Ellie stares at him he slowly morphs back into Ted as he
and the space around them become infused with an unearthly
golden light his voice ECHOING and resonating into
infinity --

TED
We are alone For millions of years
weve searched the cosmos and

after all the suffering after all
the chaos and desolation of the void
-- the one thing weve found that

makes the emptine
other Thats wh

ss bearable is each
y I sent the

We are lost inside an unimaginable realm an infinity of
nested realities turning inside and within each other ina
staggering visual paradox that dazzles and overwhelms

father on a perfect beach

in the glow of twilight A gentle breeze blows Ellis is

overcome

(overwhelmed)
So What happens now

TED

Now you go home

ELLIE

(instinctively like
a child)
No
(as Ted smiles)
I mean why so soon

TED

If we dont engineer a consistent
causality itll work itself out on
its own and thats almost always
worse

(seeing her

confusion)
Ellie according to your physics
none of this is possible A lot of
it youre simply not capable of
understanding not yet No offense

ELLIE
None taken but do we get to
come back Others of my kind I

mean
He tenderly brushes a stray lock of hair behind her ear

TED
Eventually youll get here on your
own This was just the first step
in time youll take another

ELLIE
But -- other people from our planet
should see what Ive seen -- they

should witness this for themselves

TED
That isnt the way it works

ELLIE
But you said you wanted to help --
dont you see what it would mean

TED
(gently)
No more stalling Captain

ELLIE
(intensely)
Please -- if you downloaded
everything about us you know the
problems we face the impact it

could have -- it could make the
difference --

TED
Ellie this is the way its been

done for billions of years

She looks at him pleadingly and as the part of him that
is her father look into his daughters eyes he
hesitates --

TED
but well consider your request

A breeze blows stronger now

TED
Its time to go home now

ELLIE
No Please

(smiles sadly)
Childhood is over Ellie Its time
to grow up

A WHOOSH of AIR -- Ellie spins around --

Thank God When we lost contact I

anything at all that --

What day

ELLIE
How long was I gone

INT COMMAND CONTROL - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Peter stands at the command console just as we left him

PETER
Ellie we saw you enter the
machine The benzels spun up
generating some sort of atmospheric
disturbance The benzels spun down
And then just now you stepped
out We were out of radio contact
exactly seven minutes and thirty-
five seconds The machine never
went anywhere

Peter enters the room

Are you experiencing any flu-like
symptoms Aching joints Fever

ELLIE
Im fine --

DOCTOR
Headaches Swollen glands

ELLIE
No -- could somebody please just --

DOCTOR
Vitals identical to pre-launch

ANOTHER SCIENTIST

No sign of radiation or biological
contamination of any kind Shes

ELLIE
Peter What is going on Has
everyone gone completely insane

PETER

Thats one way of putting it Kitz

the President the ISC have shut
down all official communications
thereve also been reports of riots
flaring up across the US and
Europe Until we figure out what
went wrong things may get rough
especially for you --

ELLIE
But the machine worked -- thats
what Ive been trying to tell
everyone
(in utter
frustration)
The tape -- its all there if
theyd just look at
(seeing Peters grim
look)
the tape

And as Ellie realizes with sickening certainty --

turns to an

INT DEBRIEFING ROOM

Kitz turns off the monitor turns to Ellie still in her
hospital gown and robe Peter stands nearby as do a
group of frighteningly expressionless ISC and Pentagon
officials

ELLIE
» I dont understand it All I
can think is that maybe because the
video gear wasnt accounted for in
the original plans it somehow
violated the integrity of the
design

KITZ
Is that your official response

ELLIE
I dont have an official response
Michael All I have are the same
questions you have

Kitz pauses and then he turns to her his intensity
increasing as we PUSH IN ON him --

KITZ
Im afraid thats not a satisfactory
answer Doctor We spent two
trillion dollars You walked into
that machine with the hopes and
prayers of an entire planet with
you and you stepped out with
nothing Those people are going to
want more than idle speculation and
conjecture -- theyre going to want
answers -- and I hope for all our
sakes you can come up with them

EXT MACHINE (HOKKAIDO) - NIGHT

Ellie surrounded by a phalanx of security moves quickly
through the nightmarish mob scene Disorienting TV lights
glare illuminating a flurry of drift snow --

As Ellie is hustled toward a van she glimpses a figure --
an oasis of stillness in the mob watching her -- Joss
Their eyes meet for the briefest of moments -- and then
Ellie is swept into the van and away Joss watches her go
-- looks at the chaos the madness around him -- then

slowly looks up to the sky

INT OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

The rain pours down The President slowly hangs up the
phone

INT SEDAN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Ellie looks out the window at the mob descending on the
car all fighting desperately to catch a glimpse of her --
faces filled with hope hate desperation -- Ellie shrinks
back --

INT SENATE ANTEROOM - DAY

The CLOCK TICKING on the wall reads five to nine

Ellie sits alone in the small room Waiting

A KNOCK on the door Ellie looks up nervously --

Palmer Joss stands in the doorway A moment and then
Ellie slowly rises and goes to him Embraces him He

holds her

JOSS
Oh Ellie

Ellie finally pulling away wiping her eyes

ELLIE
Hi

JOSS
Hi

ELLIE

Im assuming you read my deposition

JOSS
It was quite a page turner

ELLIE
Pretty ironic huh I had to go all
the way to the center of the
galaxy Just to find you

She takes his hand kisses it He touches her face
The CLOCK TICKS
ELLIE
So Im assuming they sent you here

to administer last rites

JOSS
Im not sure its come to that

ELLIE
They dont believe me
JOSS

ELLIE
Youre sure you want to In the
universe I saw were not exactly the
stars of the show What happened to
me makes us all seem pretty damn
small

JOSS
It also makes God enormous I think
of the scope of your universe
Ellie and it takes my breath
away As it will everyone elses

ELLIE
I dont have any proof Palmer

JOSS
Ellie youre the proof You tell
them your story Ultimately theyll
have no choice but to believe you

ELLIE
Its not enough dont you
understand I know it happened --
but by every standard of science by
every standard Ive lived my life by
that fact is utterly beside the
point It may be true but it
doesnt matter because I cant prove
its real

JOSS
Ellie the only one holding you to
that standard is you The people
want to hear your story they need
to hear it

ELLIE
But --

JOSS
Have you seen whats happening out
there The terror the despair
The world is on fire Ellie People
need something they can believe in
something worthy and you can give
it to them

ELLIE
I want to Palmer -- more than
anything But it has to be real
It has to be true

JOSS
(hesitates)
Ellie if you go out there like
this -- if you admit to even the
possibility that what you
experienced didnt actually happen
-- Im afraid they really will
crucify you Please For your own
sake for the sake of the world
tell them what you know to be the
truth Tell them it really
happened

Ellie looks up at him -- and then the door opens and an
AIDE enters

AIDE
Theyre ready for you

INT US SENATE

Every corner of the cavernous Senate Chamber is jammed
with media politicians onlookers The world stage The
big show

The International Committee is composed of eight men and
two women including Kitz Occupying the center seat is
the COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN An Asian American Senator in his
sixties

Sitting all by herself at a long table opposite them
Ellie looks very small and alone

SENATOR
You were in the machine for seven
minutes thirty-five seconds is
that correct Doctor

ELLIE
Earth time yes
SENATOR
(pausing)
Earth time
ELLIE
(a deep breath)
Senator I believe I traveled

through a series of wormholes
Wormholes are a phenomenon deduced
by Einstein theyre essentially
tears in the fabric of spacetime
Because of the effects of relativity
what I experienced as a period of
approximately eighteen hours passed
almost instantaneously on Earth To
you I seemed to depart and arrive
back at the same moment
KITZ
Doctor isnt it true that wormholes
are merely predictions of relativity
theory That theres no evidence
they actually exist

Ellie hesitates Looks up at Joss in the gallery Then

ELLIE
There is no direct evidence no

KITZ
And current theory holds that to
sustain the sort of wormholes youre
talking about even for a fraction
of a second would require more
energy than our sun produces ina
year is that correct

ELLIE
I dont have the figures in front of
me but yes that sounds about
right

KITZ
In fact by all the laws of physics
we know what you claim to have
experienced is simply impossible

ELLIE
(beat then softly)
By our standards yes

Palmer Joss sitting in the gallery closes his eyes
SAME SCENE - LATER

The Chairman flips slowly through a file as he questions
Ellie

CHAIRMAN
And this is how the
extraterrestrial presented himself
to you As your father

ELLIE
Yes sir
CHAIRMAN
He died
(looks at file)
» in 1972

ELLIE
Yes sir
CHAIRMAN
(pausing)
Dr Arroway do you think its
possible you had some kind of
delusional episode

Joss leans forward in his chair

ELLIE
Is it possible

CHAIRMAN
All the elements are there A
woman orphaned young under a great
deal of stress The failure of a
project shes staked her self-worth
and very sense of identity on --
induces a fantasy of reuniting with
her father in heaven as it were
Is it possible

Ellie is silent

The crowd murmurs

KITZ
Please answer the question Doctor

ELLIE
(a long silence)
Is it possible Yes But --

KITZ
Thank you Doctor Now --

ELLIE
(overriding him)
-- but I dont believe it to be the
truth

CHAIRMAN
(peering at her
intrigued)
You dont believe it to be tell

me something Doctor Why do you
think they would go to all this
trouble bring you tens of
thousands of light years and then
send you home without a shred of
proof Sort of bad form wouldnt
you say What was their intent

ELLIE
(hesitates)
I dont know Ultimately their
motives may be as incomprehensible
as their technology

Committee members exchange glances
CHAIRMAN
(sigh)

Dr Arroway you come before us with
no evidence No records no
artifacts -- only a story that -- to
put I mildly -- strains credibility
Over two trillion dollars was spent
hundreds of lives were lost many
more may be in jeopardy due to the
almost incalculable worldwide
psychological impact Are you
going to sit there and tell us that
we should simply take this all on
faith

The word rings out like a shot Silence

KITZ
Answer the question Doctor Asa
scientist -- can you prove any of

this
JOSS
Holding his breath
ELLIE
Closes her eyes Finally almost inaudibly

ELLIE
No

The room is silent Almost gently

KITZ
So why dont you admit what by your
own standards must be the truth
that this experience simply didnt

happen
ELLIE
(pauses then
simply)
Because I cant
The crowd reacts
Ellie looks up to the gallery and finds Joss

As she speaks with great emotion and restraint she seems
to be talking directly to him

ELLIE
I had an experience I cant
prove it I cant even explain it
All I can tell you is that
everything I know as a human being
everything I am -- tells me that it
was real

The room grows quiet

ELLIE
(softly)

I was given something wonderful
Something that changed me A vision
of the universe that made it
overwhelmingly clear just how tiny
and insignificant -- and at the same
time how rare and precious we all
are A vision that tells us we
belong to something greater than
ourselves that were not -- that
none of us -- is alone

JOSS
Moved beyond words
ELLIE

looks lovingly at Palmer then shifts her gaze to
Michael Kitz Softly

ELLIE

I wish I could share it I wish
everyone if only for a moment --
could feel that sense of awe and
humility and hope That
continues to be my wish

The emotion in her voice compels the room to silence

Kitz

Joss

Ellie

INT CAPITOL BUILDING - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Spilling out reporters closing in As Kitz emerges he

sees Ellie -- she meets his gaze
A moment and then he nods walks briskly off Ellie
turns -- to find Joss standing by the door waiting for

her A timeless moment

and then she silently crosses to him and lets him fold
her into his arms

EXT CAPITOL BUILDING - NIGHT
The rain lashes down unabated A sea of press crushing in
on Ellie and Joss as they grimly make their way through
police clearing the way -- A ZEALOT intones in the bg --

ZEALOT
He dreamed and behold a
ladder was set up on the Earth and
the top of it reached to heaven
Surely the Lord is in this place
and I knew it not This is none
other but the House of God

As Ellie moves through the crowd PEOPLE in wheelchairs
fight to approach people with terrible deformities --
they call to her

PEOPLE
Ellie Bless me Ellie Heal
me

Ellie torn between wanting to help these suffering souls
and not wanting to lie whispers

ELLIE
Im sorry Im sorry

And then the reporters descend shouting out questions --
one in particular rings out --

REPORTER
Reverend Joss do you think the
failure of the machine is Gods
rebuke to science

Joss stops He turns to the crowd slowly

JOSS
As a person of faith I am bound
by a different covenant than Dr
Arroway -- but I believe our goal is
one and the same the pursuit of
the truth I think today Dr
Arroway continued that pursuit under
the most trying of conditions

He puts his arm around Ellie and hurries away The
crowds the media watch as the Messiah who failed
disappears into the rainy night

EXT LAKE TIMOTHY (OREGON) - DUSK (DECEMBER 31 2001)

The small figures of Ellie and Joss walk along the
beautiful lake under the forested slopes of Mt Hood

ELLIE
but it is a good question and I
suppose Ill always wonder about the
answer Why would they send me back
without proof

JOSS
Maybe what you experienced cant be
reduced to images on a videotape
Maybe they still plan to grant your
request only in their own way in
their own time Or maybe its just
like you said ultimately their
motives may be as incomprehensible
as their technology

ELLIE
In other words God works in
mysterious ways

JOSS
(smiles)
In other words
They stop look out at the water
ELLIE

I dont know If it was a god it
was searching for a greater one It
was still searching for meaning

JOSS
Does that mean you think it doesnt
exist

ELLIE

Im not sure
(looking up

)

Maybe it simply exists in the search
for it Maybe its something we have

to make for ourselves

JOSS
Meaning

ELLIE

void -- the

one thing that makes the vastness
