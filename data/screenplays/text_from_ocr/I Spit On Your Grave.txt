EXT CITY STREET - DAY

JENNIFER HILLS races down from a stoop a suitcase rolling
along behind her Even dressed down this city girl cant
hide her natural beauty and panache

She makes her way across the street and to an SUV she opens
the trunk and tosses in the suitcase among several other
bags

She closes it and walks to the drivers side We see that
the entire cargo bay of the SUV is filled with boxes and
personal affects

Al INT SUV CITY STREET - DAY Al

Jennifer gets in and slams the door shut she takes a moment
to think to breathe Something is weighing heavily on her
mind

After a beat she glances up to the rearview mirror and

at herself She take a long deep cleansing breath and
then she turns the key in the ignition and starts the car
Bl EXT SUV CITY STREET - DAY Bl

The SUV drives off down the city street

Cl EXT CITY OVERPASS - DAY Cl

The SUV carves its way through traffic as the city looms in
the background growing more distant by the second

2 INT CAR RURAL ROAD - DAY 2
The midday sun bakes the landscape as Jennifer drives

a country road A stark contrast from the city and
absolutely breathtaking

checks

GPS SYSTEM
Turn right up ahead

Jennifer squints out the front windshield The streets are
all unpaved and none of them are marked with street signs

Finally Jennifer pulls into the driveway of a small house
She picks up a piece of paper from the passenger seat

the address on the house and gets out of the car
3 EXT EARLS PLACE - DAY 3

Jennifer walks up the crumbling steps of the house On the
screen door a wire holds a wooden sign that reads OPEN
The screen door SQUEAKS loudly as Jennifer pulls it open

JENNIFER
Hello

Jennifer cautiously steps inside
4 INT EARLS PLACE - DAY 4

The sunlight shines through the dirty curtains Dust clouds
hang motionless in the air as if suspended in a solution

Scattered across the floor are a variety of electronics in

various stages of disrepair A handful of old picture tube
TVs with their plastic casings cracked

JENNIFER
Hello

Jennifer walks in further trying to not step on anything

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Hello

EARL (0S)

drawn

From out of the back walks the proprietor EARL (late-50s)
takes a double take at Jennifer surely the prettiest thing
hes seen in a long while He sees her standing in the
middle of the mess suddenly aware of it He bends down to
pick something up in a futile attempt to clean

EARL (CONTD)
Sorry about the mess

JENNIFER

Earl walks over to a cabinet against the wall opens a small
drawer and takes out a key

EARL (CONTD)

Earl hands her the key Earl pulls a map with some hand-

arrows already on it
EARL

Earl just looks at her

EARL

Jennifer looks at the map
5 EXT RURAL ROAD - DAY 5

Jennifer drives down the two lane road barely passable by
two cars She swerves as she glances down at map

Then up ahead she spots a small SERVICE STATION with a
single gas pump She pulls up to the pump

EXT SERVICE STATION - DAY 6
Jennifer gets out of the car and fumbles to fold back the

as she twists the knob off her gas tank and reaches for the
pump A HAND comes down on top of her own

Jennifer spins around

Standing there smiling is JOHNNY He takes the pump from
Jennifer and inserts it into her gas tank

JOHNNY
Didnt mean to frighten you

Johnny is good-looking in a rugged sort of way Hes sinewy
but athletic and strong Jennifer regains her composure

JENNIFER
No its fine Im sort of lost
anyway Looking for Mockingbird
Trail

JOHNNY
You are definitely lost

JENNIFER
Really I thought--

JOHNNY
Nah you sure missed it Its a
good ten miles back left turn
after the big red mailbox

Johnny

ISOYG PINK 102909 4A

JENNIFER
Oh okay I think I saw that

ISOYG PINK 102909 5
Johnny flashes his smile picking his teeth with a

Jennifer stands there uncomfortably

JOHNNY
You uh staying at the cabin

Jennifer hesitates for a second Just as Jennifer opens her
mouth to respond the shrill notes of a HARMONICA shatter

silence Jennifer turns quickly to the garage

In the garage ANDY one of Johnnys employees sits on the
fender of a broken down car He holds a harmonica to his
lips Hes in his mid-30s with shaggy hair and arms that
look like they could bend steel

STANLEY one of Johnny and Andys buddies walks up behind
Andy Hes balding and overweight and digs into a bag of
pork rinds

STANLEY
Howdy maam

He leans into Andy who continues playing his harp
ANDY

Id sop that up with a biscuit real

good

Jennifer turns away from the garage and looks back at

who is still awaiting her answer

JENNIFER
Uh no I mean yes
As she glances to the gas pump Johnny looks her up and
down
She is definitely something to look at

Johnny places his hand on the hood of the car Glances to
the guys then back to her

JOHNNY
You know youre running a little
hot Want me to uh maybe I

should check under your hood
Jennifer almost laughs at the way that sounded

JENNIFER
Hows that line working for you

The gas pump clicks off interrupting But Johnny just stands
there looking at her

ISOYG PINK 102909 5A

JOHNNY
I dont know hows it working for
you

Johnny saunters over to the pump and in a phallic manner
pulls the pump out It gets laughs from the peanut gallery
Jennifer looks away a line has been crossed She looks to
the pump again 1978

ISOYG PINK 102909 6

JENNIFER
Let me just
Jennifer fumbles into her purse when the map falls from her
hands

JOHNNY
Ill get that

JENNIFER
No I got it--

Johnny gets uncomfortably close to Jennifer at the rear door
of the car when--

HONK -- HONK -- HONK - The SUVs deafening alarm blares out
Johnnys startled stumbles backwards trips and goes
sprawling to the ground

Jennifer controlling laughter holds up her keys and clicks
the alarm off

Johnny is covered in dust and oil struggling to get to his
feet while maintaining a shred of dignity Jennifer
chuckles

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Sorry I accidentally hit the
panic button Are you okay

JOHNNY
Im fine

Johnny looks away angry Hes certainly not the type of guy
who can laugh at himself easily if at all From the garage
Stanley and Andy point at him and guffaw

ANDY
(from the garage)
Hey You better check your
underwear Johnny

Stanley smiles and elbows Andy but his mouth is too full
with pork rinds to actually laugh

STANLEY
Yea Check um for skidmarks
Johnny shoots him a harsh look

Jennifer hands Johnny a twenty Trying to contain her
laughter
ISOYG PINK 102909 6A

JENNIFER
Sure you okay

Johnnys eyes are cold his face red

ISOYG PINK 102909 7

JOHNNY
I said I was fine

Suddenly Jennifer grows uneasy She smiles uncomfortably
gets in the car and drives away

Johnny takes a bandana from his pocket and wipes his brow
He watches Jennifers car disappear and spits on the ground
as the laughter escalates in her absence Johnny spins

JOHNNY (CONTD)
What the hell are you two dipshits
laughing at

7 EXT CABIN - DAY 7

Jennifer arrives at the cabin She gets out of her car and
stands there looking up at it In slight disrepair and in
need of a paint job but the quaint charm makes you quickly
forget its shortcomings

of wine writing away She couldnt be more content

ISOYG PINK 102909 8
She takes a deep replenishing breath and then goes back to

WRITING--
A10 INT CABIN - DAY A10

CLOSE ON Words fly across the screen as Jennifer types at a
furious pace Blocks of text keep scrolling away

Her fingers effortlessly swipe away at key after key a
writers high if you will

Finally an exclamation point is stabbed with emphasis Then
she hears a sound off in the trees

She looks out and hears a very distant few notes of a
harmonica Then a few even more distant heeeeeeweeece
After a beat she innocently smiles figuring its just some
boys off in the distance having a party or something
Jennifer leans back smiles briefly and pour herself a glass
of wine

11 EXT CABIN FRONT PORCH - DUSK 11

Jennifer sits at the table her laptop propped open in front
of her Shes talking away on the phone as she stops for a
moment to take a sip from a glass of red wine

JENNIFER
(INTO PHONE)
-Lonely Are you kidding I

The wind kicks up and a in the distance a door is slammed
shut It startles jennifer She looks in the direction of
the
sound

Another slam and again

JENNIFER (CONTD)

(INTO PHONE)
Barb hold on a minute

ISOYG PINK 102909 8A

dusky woods Then back to the house

A light breeze kicks up and SLAM Again

JENNIFER (CONTD)

(INTO PHONE)

ISOYG PINK 102909 9
Jennifer snaps the phone shut and walks down the steps of
the front porch

JENNIFER (CONTD)

In response she gets the frantic CHIRPING of crickets as
night encroaches
Jennifer walks down a path and in the near distance she see

a

She makes her way towards the shed

Jennifer thinks she hears something from deep inside the

shed She moves in further as--

SLAM

The door shuts behind her -

JENNIFER

Shit

C11 EXT CABIN SHED - DUSK Cll

Jennifer exits and securely closes the shed door After a

beat she smirks at the thought that she thought this was
more

than just a door blowing in the wind then heads back to the
cabin

Jennifer stands at the sink in panties and tank top - pre-
soaking her sweater and pants

POV THROUGH KITCHEN WINDOW

Jennifer continues at the sink her beautiful partially
nude

body is framed perfectly in the window for all to see but

no ones around for miles

14 EXT WOODS - DAY 14

Jennifer jogs through the trees She wears a tight pair of

running shorts and a out off T-shirt

Jennifer stops in a small clearing With her hands on her

knees she struggles to catch her breath

She stands and walks in a circle looks around Checks her

watch

Then notices something in the distance hidden behind the

trees

ANGLE ON A dilapidated shack rotted from decay and
neglect

Jennifers curiosity gets the best of her

15 EXT DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 15

She walks up to the shack looks around She then enters
through what is left of the front door

ISOYG PINK 102909 11

A15 INT DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY A15

The place hasnt been occupied in quite a while but it was
once An old dirty mattress in the corner a sawhorse-

a-counter with old cans and bottles even a rusty old
garden tool or two

Near the window she sees an old mold covered BIBLE propped
open

Jennifer suddenly gets the chills she shakes it off and

gets the hell out of there
16 EXT CABIN - DAY 16

Jennifer finishes her jog and returns to the cabin leans
over on the porch and catches her breath

17 INT CABIN BATHROOM - DAY 17

Jennifer stands in front of the mirror She looks at her
reflection and pulls out the band that was holding up her
ponytail Her sweat-soaked hair falls across her shoulders
She turns on the faucet and is met with a dirty spray

JENNIFER
Eww
The spray only lasts a few seconds before sputtering out
However then the toilet starts to GURGLE Jennifer lifts
the lid up with her foot The toilet water bubbles up and
then disappears down the drain

JENNIFER (CONTD)

(SHUDDERS)
Gross
Again Jennifer tries the sink but now nothing comes out

18 INT CABIN KITCHEN - DAY 18

Jennifer picks up her cellphone from the counter She takes
a small piece of paper out of her purse and punches in some
numbers on the cell After a few rings voicemail picks up

animal please leave your name --

Jennifer snaps the phone shut in frustration when her eye
catches the water-damaged remnants of a service sticker
hanging to the refrigerator door

Amazingly the phone number is still visible She shrugs to
herself and dials the number

19 INT CABIN BATHROOM -- DAY 19

She lifts the lid and looks inside - dry - and flushes a few
more times to no avail - then dirty water begins to gurgle
up

JENNIFER

(LISTENS INTENTLY)

No it wont flush I did that
already yes look Im really
in a spot okay thank you

As Jennifer snaps her phone shut the handset gets caught on
her chin and tumbles into the toilet PLOP

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Oh shit
Jennifer reaches down into the toilet and immediately fishes
it out She shakes it off vigorously

20 INT CABIN KITCHEN - DAY 20

Jennifer stands next to the kitchen counter She holds her
hair dryer which is going at full blast Her cell phone is
propped open on the counter in front of her Shes doing her
best to dry it out

Suddenly a hand reaches out and taps her on the shoulder
Jennifer SCREAMS and spins around turning the hair dryer on
her assailant

An equally frightened MATTHEW throws his hands up in front
his face and SCREAMS just as loudly He has several think
colored rubber bands on his wrist

ISOYG PINK 102909 12a

MATTHEW
Pl please I I came to fix
the plumbing

ISOYG PINK 102909 13
Jennifer turns off the hair dryer

MATTHEW (CONTD)

I I was knocking on the ddoor

aa while

Jennifer breathes a sigh of relief especially after she
gets

a look at Matthew Hes in his mid-30s but could pass for

a good ten years younger Awkward and shy he can barely

make eye contact with her

JENNIFER

(FRIENDLY)
I think you may have taken a few
years off my life
Matthew doesnt get the joke

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Uh thanks for coming on such
short notice

(NO RESPONSE)
You need to see the bathroom

21 INT CABIN BATHROOM - DAY 21

Matthew works away underneath the sink Jennifer watches him
from the bedroom sitting on the end of the bed trying to
make small talk

JENNIFER
Is this gonna take much longer

MATTHEW
(muffled under the sink)
Nnot much

JENNIFER
So whats wrong with it

MATTHEW
Uh its just older pipes
Matthew continues his work you can tell he is uncomfortable
with the conversation

JENNIFER
So do you live around here

MATTHEW
Nono one lives around here

ISOYG PINK 102909 14

JENNIFER
Yeah I kind of get that I meant
in town
Matthew comes out from under the sink He snaps nerviously
at one of the rubber bands on his wrist

MATTHEW
My my whole life
Jennifer looks to his wrist Its all red
Matthew turns on the faucet Out comes a hard stream of
cold clear water He flushes the toilet and then turns on
the shower to the same result

MATTHEW (CONTD)
All fixed
the

Jennifer squeals with excitement She wraps her arms around
Matthew and plants a kiss on his cheek

JENNIFER
Thank you
Matthew blushes furiously and fumbles his tools as he packs
up For him the kiss was more embarrassing than enjoyable

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Im sorry I just you saved me
from having to bathe in the pond
Once his tools are all packed away Matthew dashes out of

cabin Jennifer follows him to the front door

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Hey Hey I didnt even pay you
But Matthew is long gone

Johnny hands him a beer and pats him on the back firmly

23 INT CABIN - NIGHT 23

Jennifer writes away at the dining room table Shes on a
tear A writers zone where everything she types is gold
She hits the return key hard as if to punctuate a
particularly good sentence She picks up some lip gloss and
puts it on

ISOYG PINK 102909 20

She leans back to take a break when her eye catches the cell
phone sitting on the table She picks the phone up flips it
open - Its still completely dead

In frustration she throws the phone across the room It
hits the couch right next to the duffle bag She smiles
mischievously to herself

Jennifer reaches inside and withdraws a sandwich bag filled
with pot and rolling papers She expertly rolls herself a
joint and lights it up She closes her eyes Bliss

24 EXT CABIN - NIGHT -- LATER 24

From a distance the cabin looks like a star twinkling in
night sky Trees sway in the breeze dappling the light
25 INT CABIN - NIGHT 25

Jennifers head is slouched over her desk She passed out
Suddenly A SCRATCHING NOISE at the front door

CLOSE ON Jennifers eyes flit open as -

Jennifer jumps awake and walks over to check the door
glancing at the clock as she goes 414 am

Jennifer gets to the door and listens Nothing She tries
to look out nothing

She turns to walk back when the scratching returns -
Jennifer takes a few steps back toward the door Again the
noise stops
JENNIFER
Hello
Silence Jennifer rises up on her toes and looks out the
glass window of the front door The porch is deserted
Jennifer opens the door slowly

26 EXT CABIN - NIGHT 26

Jennifer looks outside but nothing is there Just a gentle
breeze and the sway of the trees Satisfied she walks out
onto the front porch then down the steps She hugs herself
and shivers then she returns inside

ISOYG PINK 102909 21
27 INT CABIN FRONT DOOR - NIGHT 27

Jennifer shuts the front door and locks it Then she yanks
on the door just to make sure

28 INT CABIN - NIGHT 28
She walks back in grabbing her glass and bottle when --
29 INT CABIN - NIGHT 29

The SCRAPING sound again but this time from UPSTAIRS

Jennifer looks up hoping that she imagined it But there it

is again She sets the bottle and glass down on the end
table

next to the couch and then grabs a can of MACE from her
purse

on the couch

30 INT CABIN STAIRCASE - NIGHT 30

She walks slowly holding the mace directly in front of her
Eventually Jennifer gets to the top of the stairs

At the far end of the hallway is an open window A branch
from outside scrapes against the windowsill

Jennifer lets out a sigh of relief She closes the window
and heads back downstairs

31 INT CABIN KITCHEN - NIGHT 31
She puts the mace back in her purse and then picks up her
drink walking to the kitchen when--

BANG Something smashes into the sliding glass door--
Jennifer SCREAMS dropping the glass It SHATTERS

With more than a hint of trepidation Jennifer heads towards

THE SIDE DOOR

With all the courage she can muster up Jennifer unlocks the
door and steps outside

ISOYG PINK 102909 22
32 EXT CABIN BACK PORCH - NIGHT 32

The side porch light acts as a spotlight illuminating the

culprit -- a lone bird lies motionless on the ground
Jennifer bends down and picks up a small branch from the
porch She gives the bird a small poke nothing But her
uneasiness is growing Suddenly SLAM

She jumps and looks to the shed the door is open again and
swinging She looks to it thinking I shut that already
She moves off the porch and toward the shed

33 EXT CABIN SHED - NIGHT 33

Jennifer walks to the shed it feels longer in the dark She
looks around to the tree line could be something out there
an animal who knows

She reaches the shed and shuts the door again She searches
the ground and sees a large stone

She picks up the stone and shoves it against the door
Satisfied she heads back

34 INT CABIN - NIGHT 34

Jennifer immediately goes over to her table where the laptop
is set up She shuffles some papers around when-

Something on her laptop screen catches her attention She
leans forward brow furrowed

ON LAPTOP SCREEN A picture of Johnny Stanley and Andy
leering into the laptops camera Like a nightmarish photo
booth snapshot
JOHNNY
Nice shot huh
Jennifer shrieks and spins around only to find --
Standing there right inside the front door is Johnny He
smiles
Johnny shrugs calmly and continues milling about the room
Jennifer spins around looking for a way out

ISOYG PINK 102909 22A

But Stanley has slipped in through the back door video
camera obnoxiously filming the scene (which will be out to
throughout)

STANLEY
Smile real pretty for the camera

ISOYG PINK 102909 23

JENNIFER
(her voice cracking)
Get out of here Get out of here
right now

JOHNNY
Now thats not very hospitable is
it
Then the wooden stairs creak under Andys steps as he walks
down -- around his chest is one of Jennifers bra stretched

to the limit Hes twirling a thong panty on his finger The
guys get a good laugh at Andy

JENNIFER
All of you better get out of here
I called the police
Johnny nods He looks at her his gaze mocking
JOHNNY
You called the police Or you will
call the police

JENNIFER
I I called them already
Theyre on their way right now

JOHNNY
With what phone Matthew said you
dropped it in the drink
Jennifer doesnt answer

JOHNNY (CONTD)
(looks at Stanley)
Speaking of where the hell is he
Stanley takes a few steps toward the back door

STANLEY
Matthew get your boney ass in
here
Shortly after Matthew shuffles inside He cant even bring

closing the cabinet doors knocking stuff around He finds a
pack of rice cakes He shoves one in his mouth winces
spits it out

STANLEY

Andy turns from the desk strikes a match and flicks it at
Jennifer

Johnny stubbornly holds out the bottle of vodka Andy
giggles He finds this quite funny

JOHNNY

Jennifer studies the bottle and finally accepts it Drinks a
small sip They all start booing

JOHNNY

JENNIFER

JOHNNY

Jennifer grows increasingly nervous and reluctantly takes a
nice swig Then chokes and gags They all cheer

ISOYG PINK 102909 27

JOHNNY (CONTD)
See Now was that so bad
Johnny takes the bottle back and takes a swig himself

JENNIFER
Look Im sorry if I embarrassed

Andy and Stanley plop themselves down on the couch and prop
their feet up on the wood and glass coffee table

JOHNNY
Oh thats not what this is
about

JENNIFER

Then what is this about
Johnny jumps down from the counter He stands in front of
Jennifer towering over her

JOHNNY
I want to see your teeth
As if the air is sucked out of the room Jennifer stares at
him not even sure she heard him correctly

Matthew snaps the rubber band harder He moves to the far
corner of the room and tucks himself against the wall

JENNIFER
Wha what

JOHNNY
You heard me show Horse Show me
your teeth

JENNIFER

JOHNNY

(quiet but firm)

Show the teeth

Andy walks over and hands Johnny the small wooden bat he
used

to kill the fish Johnny smacks it against his palm

JOHNNY (CONTD)
-or lose the teeth

ISOYG PINK 102909 27A

Andy walks back to the couch and flicks another match at
Jennifer She recoils with fear as she reluctantly gives a
half-smile her teeth clenched together

ISOYG PINK 102909 28

JOHNNY (CONTD)
No Put two fingers in the side of
your mouth Then two fingers in
the other side and pull

Jennifer looks at Johnny like hes seriously disturbed as
Johnny slaps the bat against his hand punctuating his point
Jennifer puts her fingers in her mouth She pulls her lips
away from the gums spreading them grotesquely Its
completely humiliating Jennifer stops

JENNIFER
Now please Im begging you
Johnny slides off the counter

JOHNNY
Uh uh Again
Jennifer reinserts her fingers and pulls Johnny reaches
into her mouth and grabs a hold of her two front teeth with
his thumb and forefinger

JOHNNY (CONTD)
Alright Good girl Show Horse
Johnny pulls down on Jennifers teeth forcing her to the
floor Jennifer looks as if shes about to cry near her on
the ground is the broken glass
Stanley and Andy needle each other like schoolboys Matthew
shuffles nervously clearly uncomfortable at being there

JOHNNY (CONTD)
Ill tell you something
sweetheart know why you aint
got no boyfriend Cause all
them city guys are faggots
Johnny turns to her

JOHNNY (CONTD)
But uh since he isnt here
Johnny pulls out his revolver

JOHNNY (CONTD)
This is your man

He moves closer to her rubbing the gun against her cheek
her chin The blood drains from her face as -

ISOYG PINK 102909 29

JOHNNY (CONTD)
Why dont you give him a kiss-
With terror in her eyes Jennifer quickly kisses the gun-

JOHNNY (CONTD)
Nah not like the peck you gave
Matthew lets see a real kiss
He slides the barrel into Jennifers mouth Jennifer gags
instinctively Johnny holds the back of her head not
allowing her to pull away and offers some encouragement

JOHNNY (CONTD)
Breathe through your nose Breathe
through your nose like it was your
first time
Johnny pulls the gun out just a tiny bit and pushes it back
into her cheek causing it to bulge out
Naturally Stanley and Andy both find this hysterical
Especially once Jennifer begins to cry

JOHNNY (CONTD)

(TO JENNIFER)
On your knees
Jennifer complies Johnny holds the gun in front of his
crotch and again forces it into Jennifers mouth

JOHNNY (CONTD)

if I dont like your enthusiasm I

may cum early

(cocks the gun)

And thats something you really

dont want

Jennifer has no choice She begins to fellate the gun as

deep as she can take it without gagging

Johnny closes his eyes and feigns pleasure Finally hes

had enough He retracts the gun as Jennifer recoils gags

Her eyes begin to scan the cabin for any way out of this
hell

as Andy stands up from the couch

ANDY
My turn

ISOYG PINK 102909 29A
the

STANLEY
Come on let Matthew have a go

ISOYG PINK 102909 30

Johnny walks up to Matthew angrily and slaps him across

face He points to Jennifer

JOHNNY
What do you mean you dont want to

(TEASING)

Now shut up and prove it
Matthew holds his fist against his face

ANDY
Aw fuck it I aint waiting
Andy grabs the VODKA BOTTLE He walks over to Jennifer
still on her knees and positions the bottle right in front
of his crotch

ANDY (CONTD)
Suck it bitch
Jennifer opens her mouth and moves her head toward the
bottle As she maneuvers the bottle-neck into her mouth her
eye catches a large shard of glass next to Andys boot
As soon as Andy turns around to smile at his friends
Jennifer grabs the bottle and cracks it upside his kneecap
Andy immediately grabs his leg and falls to the floor
The guys start laughing as--
Jennifer leaps up from the floor and rushes over to her
purse She quickly pulls out a canister of mace -
Before the guys even register what is happening Jennifer is
racing at Stanley --
As he brings the camera down hes met with a spray of mace
He clutches his face screaming in pain --
And like that - Jennifer is out the back door
shiny

35 EXT CABIN - DAWN 35

Jennifer leaps over the porch steps and sprints across the
backyard as the first light creeps through the trees Within
seconds shes in the woods

ISOYG PINK 102909 31
36 EXT WOODS - DAWN 36

Jennifer runs for all shes worth Every few yards she
looks behind her just to make sure that no one is chasing
her The morning light now fully visible Then just as she
turns back around Jennifer smacks right into something and
goes sprawling

When her vision comes into focus she sees the side of a

black boot Next to it the long slim barrel of a shotgun
Jennifer looks up at the figure

FIGURE
Whoa whoa whoa there Easy
darlin
The Figure extends his hand As Jennifer reaches for it she
sees his jacket pull away from his chest revealing a silver
badge Shes found SHERIFF STORCH a small town sheriff with
a small town charm that can easily be confused as smarmy

JENNIFER
Help me Please
Standing next to the Sheriff also holding a hunting rifle
is Earl Earl looks over at the Sheriff

SHERIFF STORCH
Okay okay I gotcha
The Sheriff helps Jennifer to her feet

EARL
I know this one She rented the
place down on Mockingbird Trail

JENNIFER

Jennifer breaks down again

SHERIFF STORCH
Maam please you have to calm

But Jennifer is hysterical desperately holding back tears

JENNIFER
In my mouth He put a gun in my
mouth You dont understand

ISOYG PINK 102909 32

SHERIFF STORCH
Maam Its okay Im the Sheriff

Jennifer forces herself to take a deep breath and manages to
pull herself together

JENNIFER
Four men It was four of them
They broke into my cabin They

assaulted me
Earl just watches not knowing what to do

SHERIFF STORCH
Are you hurt Do you need a

Jennifer shakes her head

SHERIFF STORCH (CONTD)

37 BRT CABIN - DAY 37

Sheriff Storch and Jennifer pull up to the cabin They both
get out of the cruiser With his double barrel shotgun in
hand Sheriff Storch begins walking up toward the porch

38 INT CABIN - DAY 38

Sheriff Storch and Jennifer enter the cabin It appears
empty

SHERIFF STORCH
Hello

Miller Miller this is the

Sheriff if you and your boys are

Sheriff Storch disappears into the kitchen for a second
then back out as he makes his way over to the foot of the
stairs He looks up the staircase

SHERIFF STORCH (CONTD)

Miller if youre up there youll

be leaving by the window

No answer Sheriff Storch looks at Jennifer

SHERIFF STORCH (CONTD)

Stay here

Sheriff Storch heads up the stairs Jennifer uncomfortable
at being left alone backs away to the wall Every noise
every foot step makes her shiver

After a few seconds the Sheriff comes back to the top of

stairs

ISOYG PINK 102909 34

SHERIFF STORCH (CONTD)
Its empty
He walks back down

SHERIFF STORCH (CONTD)

No sign of em If they were here

Sheriff Storch makes his way through and walks back into--

39 INT CABIN KITCHEN - DAY 39

Jennifer follows him and watches as he inspects it closely
His eyes fall on the box of liquor bottles

SHERIFF STORCH
You here alone

JENNIFER
Yes
SHERIFF STORCH

(RE LIQUOR)
With all this

JENNIFER
I wasnt going to drink it all this
weekend I I planned on being

here for a couple of months

SHERIFF STORCH

JENNIFER
Yes well they were They forced
me to
He moves away and walks back through the cabin
As he does he spots the glass shattered on the floor and
the nearby THONG and BRA that Andy flung at her
Takes a long hard look at them then looks back up to
Jennifer

JENNIFER (CONTD)
One of them he was up there went
through everything

ISOYG PINK 102909 35
Sheriff Storch taps the broken glass with his thick boot

SHERIFF STORCH
(pointing to the glass)
They do this too

JENNIFER
Please I dont care about those
things They shoved a gun in my
mouth
Jennifer breaks down again as the Sheriff moves toward her

SHERIFF STORCH
Okay okay Maam Its okay now
Them boys are gone Youre safe
now
Jennifer nods to him still shaken Storch looks to the lock
on the back door
He walks toward the back door and turns the dead bolt back
and forth

SHERIFF STORCH (CONTD)
(re back door)
Was this locked

JENNIFER
Yes Of course

40 EXT CABIN - DAY 40

Sheriff Storch steps onto the porch Jennifer follows

Sheriff Storch looks down and sees the dead bird at his
feet

He pokes it with the barrel of his shotgun

SHERIFF STORCH
How long you been here

JENNIFER
Just a few days

SHERIFF STORCH
Anything strange happen before
this You have a run in with any
of these guys

JENNIFER
No Not really I stopped for gas
and directions

ISOYG PINK 102909 36
41 INT CABIN - DAY 41

Back inside Sheriff Storch hooks his fingers into his belt

and continues to look around

His eyes casually fall upon the roach sitting in the
ashtray

He picks it up and smells it

SHERIFF STORCH
not

Maam is this your marijuana
cigarette
Suddenly Jennifer realizes that simple possession might

go over in this small town like it does in Manhattan

JENNIFER
Uh nno The men probably
left it
Sheriff Storch walks over to Jennifer until hes standing
directly in front of her

SHERIFF STORCH
You mean to tell me that one of
these guys was wearing lipstick
Storch holds up the roach Jennifer notices the lipstick
smear on the rolling paper She casts her eyes downward

SHERIFF STORCH (CONTD)

This aint the big city

Sheriff Storch stands uncomfortably close Slowly he walks
closer up to Jennifers face stares into her eyelids Pulls
down one of them Then the other Then his gaze falls down
to her chest her ample cleavage His stare lingers a bit
too long

JENNIFER
Please I swear I didnt make it
up I may have smoked a joint but-
Sheriff Storch lifts his walkie-talkie to his mouth

SHERIFF STORCH
(into the walkie-talkie)
This is Sheriff Storch Im at the
Mockingbird Cabin I gonna need
some backup
The words out of the Sheriffs mouth seem almost surreal

ISOYG PINK 102909 37
JENNIFER

(BECOMING FRANTIC)
Backup What could you possibly
need back up for Im the victim
Sheriff Storch holds up his hand cutting her off

SHERIFF STORCH
Maam Youve been drinking and
smoking marijuana and you got
enough alcohol here to put our
whole town three sheets to the
wind Youre running around in
your nighty at the crack of dawn
You need to see this from my point
of view

JENNIFER
What They were here They
assaulted me Youve got to

SHERIFF STORCH
I just want to get to the bottom of
it Youre making serious
accusations bout boys Ive know
since they was kids and you
havent been all together truthful

(BEAT)
Now please against the wall
Angry and ashamed Jennifer walks over and places her palms
against the wall her legs pressed tightly together
Sheriff Storch inches up behind her He taps the inside of
her thigh with his shotgun

SHERIFF STORCH (CONTD)

Shoulder width apart face to the

wall

Jennifer has no choice but to comply

He pats up and down Jennifers side When he gets to the
swell of her breast he slides his hand to the front ever so
slightly Jennifer reflexively turns--

SHERIFF STORCH (CONTD)

Face to the wall

Sheriff Storch puts his hand to the side of her face and
puts

it to the wall Jennifer cringes
to

ISOYG PINK 102909 37A
Then he kicks her leg out wide with a firm Boot as he starts
to frisk her entire body creeping his hands ever so close

her crotch

ISOYG PINK 102909 38

SHERIFF STORCH (CONTD)
I want the whole story now The
whole thing

(SLOWLY)
Start with telling me what those
boys did
A long dreadful beat hangs in the air as--

JOHNNY (0S)

Yeah and tell the truth show

Horse

Jennifer snaps her head around again to see Johnny enter the
cabin as Andy and Stanely push Matthew in front of them
Johnny walks over to Jennifer He stands next to the
Sheriff

JOHNNY (CONTD)
Better yet lets show him As I
recall those pretty little lips
couldnt get enough

SHERIFF STORCH

(MOCK SURPIRSE)
Really
Sheriff Storch then takes the barrel of his shotgun and
pushes down the top of Jennifers blouse
Jennifers paralyzed as he runs the shotgun across her
nipple

SHERIFF STORCH (CONTD)
flush

(TO JENNIFER)
They do this to you
Jennifer is too terrified to speak Sheriff Storch then
slips the shotgun down between her legs

SHERIFF STORCH (CONTD)
I asked you a question
Jennifer trembles with fear

JENNIFER
Please

JOHNNY
Show him those teeth Show Horse

ISOYG PINK 102909 38A
Sheriff Storch brings the gun back up to her mouth - slides
it under Jennifers top lip and pushes it up

ISOYG PINK 102909 39

SHERIFF STORCH
Whinny
With her top lip forced up by the barrel of the shotgun
Jennifer can only make a GRUNTING noise Sheriff Storch
takes the shotgun out of Jennifers mouth and places it

against the side of her head He pushes her to the floor
Jennifer lets out a YELP as she falls

SHERIFF STORCH (CONTD)

I said whinny

Jennifer makes a pathetic SOUND Not really a whinny but
more of a half-cry half-snort Naturally this amuses Andy
and Stanley -- who is of course filming it -- to no end
STANLEY
Oh man Oh man

SHERIFF STORCH

(TO JENNIFER)
On your knees And keep going
Jennifer gets to her knees As instructed she whinnies
interspersed with sobs Johnny slaps her ass viciously

JOHNNY
Keep whinnying
Jennifer looks up at Sheriff Storch with pleading eyes
Sheriff Storch picks her up by her hair but--
Jennifer comes up swinging -- connecting with the Sheriffs
face The slightest scratch across his lip
Sheriff Storch turns beet red He backhands her across the
face sending her back down to the floor A thin line of
blood flows from her nose The Sheriff looks over to Johnny
licks his lip and nods his head

SHERIFF STORCH
Think you outta tame this little
mare of yours
Johnny takes the Sheriffs lead

JOHNNY
Alright come on Show Horse Get
up Or you wont get a sugar cube
Jennifer struggles to her feet She stands in front of them
defenseless Johnny grabs her hair and pulls her head far
back She lets out a half-moan

ISOYG PINK 102909 40
JOHNNY (CONTD)

(TO MATTHEW)
Take off your clothes Were about

Matthew shakes his head His wrist is not beat red from the
rubber bands Snap

JOHNNY (CONTD)
chin

band shit faggot

STANLEY
Come on Matthew You want to talk
the talk then walk the walk you
virgin
Johnny flicks open a pocket knife He tickles Jennifers
bottom lip with the blade then gently runs it down her

past her neck and between her breasts just before stopping
at the waistband then he slices the waistband of her pants

her pants drop to the floor
JOHNNY

(TO MATTHEW)
Do it now Or else I slice her
chin to cunt
This gets Matthew moving A few seconds later hes in his
boxer shorts with his hands crossed in front of his crotch
Johnny grabs him and throws him up against the wall He then
yanks his boxers down Matthew immediately covers up his
crotch

STANLEY
Matthew what the hell Its not
even hard
Matthew sweats profusely

SHERIFF STORCH
Well maybe its not totally his
fault After all shes not doing
much to get his motor running
Sheriff Storch looks back to Jennifer

SHERIFF STORCH (CONTD)

Dance
Jennifer begins to cry again

ISOYG PINK 102909 41

SHERIFF STORCH (CONTD)
Stop it Or else Ill really give

you something to cry about Now

Jennifer starts to dance in the middle of the room It is
sad pathetic and downright frightening

JOHNNY
Come on Move that rear of yours
Show Horse Prance for us
Sheriff Storch stalks around her taking it all in then he
walks back in closer to her in her face

SHERIFF STORCH
You dance like that in those city
clubs
Jennifer closes her eyes Tears stream down her face

STANLEY
She dance like that theyd throw
her butt to the curb

JOHNNY
Prance like you mean it Like you

With a swift hard backhand Sheriff Storch smacks her ass
and hard

ANDY
Thatll get her moving
The guys hoot and holler Except for Matthew who looks as
if he too is about to cry

MATTHEW
(o) kay Ill ddo it
Matthew walks slowly over to Jennifer With no warning
Matthew takes Jennifers face in his hands and kisses her
The men HOWL with sadistic glee Jennifer slaps him right
across the face then she tries to run but--
Sheriff Storch forces her to the ground He walks up to
Matthew

SHERIFF STORCH
Dont waste my time you thickheaded
pric

they

ISOYG PINK 102909 42

Johnny pushes Matthew down on top of her

Jennifer instinctively swings and connects with Matthews
face - He recoils in pain - but the guys cheer him on as

decide to help him out Andy tears open her shirt Johnny
yanks down her panties Jennifer claws and kicks at all of
them as she desperately tries to fight him off

SHERIFF STORCH (CONTD)

Get her legs

Sheriff Storch kneels down and holds Jennifers arms above
her head Johnny takes one leg Andy takes the other
Matthew moves on top of her Jennifer lets out an inhuman
SCREAM the vocal culmination of it all

ON JENNIFERS FACE Her eyes are tightly shut as she goes in
and out of focus

Suddenly a cell phone RINGS Sheriff Storch looks down at
his pocket then over to Stanley

SHERIFF STORCH (CONTD)

Put that thing down and hold her

arms keep her quiet

Stanley places the CAM on top of the table - its still
getting everything

Sheriff Storch walks a few paces away from the rape He
looks down at the screen of his phone

On the PHONE is a photo of an angelic little girl with the
banner of CHASTITY Storch presses a button

SHERIFF STORCH (CONTD)

(INTO PHONE)
Hello Angel

CHASTITY (V0)

Hi Daddy You at the station

Jennifer SCREAMS out Sheriff Storch keeps his attention on
the phone call

SHERIFF STORCH

(INTO PHONE)
No Angel Out on a call
WIDESHOT In the foreground Sheriff Storch speaks casually
to his daughter In the background Jennifers legs are the
only visual cues of the struggle that goes on right behind
to

ISOYG PINK 102909 43

CHASTITY (V0)
Oh sorry

SHERIFF STORCH

(INTO PHONE)
Its okay You need something

CHASTITY (V0)
Daddy its Sunday You always make

SHERIFF STORCH

(INTO PHONE)
Yeah yeah well Daddys busy
Angel Tell mother Im running a
little late
Sheriff Storch stares at the phone for a second then slides
the phone back into his pocket As he turns back around
Jennifer with all her strength bucks Matthew off
The guys start laughing hysterically
She finally gets her hands free and lands a barrage of
punches in Matthews face

JOHNNY
Jesus Matthew Youre getting
your ass whooped by a girl
Matthew snaps He wraps his hands around her neck and begins
pumping away like a lunatic For some reason the anger
allows him to perform
Jennifer struggles to breathe Luckily before all oxygen to
her brain is cut off Matthew stops He SCREAMS as he
finishes His hands fall from her neck as he collapses on

top of her
The MEN all cheer as Matthew staggers to his feet -- weak
He looks like he could throw up -- and he does - right off

the side as the others just lose it
Jennifer curls herself into a ball and SOBS

SHERIFF STORCH

(TO MATTHEW)
You can thank us later
herself

oblivious

to-

Matthew recovers gets up and runs to the bathroom Johnny
points to the vomit

ISOYG PINK 102909 44
JOHNNY

(TO STANLEY)
Clean this shit up

STANLEY
Make her do it

JOHNNY

(ANGRILY)
Just do it you piece of shit
Jennifer grabs the end of the coffee table and forces

up She steadies herself keeping one hand on the wall and
stumbles to the back door Surprisingly none of the men
attempt to stop her They dont even look in her direction
Jennifer staggers out the back door trying to catch her
breath as she fearfully stumbles off into the woods

42 EXT WOODS - DAY 42
Like a zombie Jennifer shuffles through the woods

to the cold air rocks thorns mud as her bare feet move
her along

She desperately continues on through looking for a way out
But in her state she has no sense of navigation She
continues to lose herself further and further into the
forest

As she finally steps into the clearing the melancholy notes
of a harmonica shatter the stillness Shes made her way

43 EXT FISHING HOLE - DAY 43

Andy sits on a log blowing softly into the harmonica as the
rest of the guys lounge around casually as if they
instinctively knew shed end up here Jennifer is too
up

shocked to move too tired to cry

Jennifer tries to escape but Johnny stops her He grabs her
by the shoulders and throws her to Andy who smacks her down
in the shallow water Andy pounces down on her back
Stanley kneels down right in front of Jennifers face He
places the MiniDV cam only a few feet in front of her He
then turns the LCD so its facing Jennifer -- so she can
actually watch herself being abused

Andy pulls her eyelids wide open and holds them there

ISOYG PINK 102909 44a

STANLEY
You ever get mace in your eyes
bitch It smarts

ISOYG PINK 102909 45
Andy shoves her face down into the water - then pulls her

ON MINIDV CAM Eyes pried wide open Jennifer gags as the
dirty water pours from her nose - mouth - she desperately
tries to breathe --

Andy shoves her face down again and again as Stanley films

STANLEY (CONTD)
Hold her head down Hold it down

JOHNNY
Alright This fillys got a few
more races to run--
Sheriff Storch approaches Jennifer Although she cant even
turn around she senses their presence
Storch gets down into her face

SHERIFF STORCH
I hope you got some fight left in
you I like it rough
JENNIFER

(BARELY AUDIBLE)
Please Please Im so hurt
Sheriff Storch spits onto the ground

SHERIFF STORCH
Not to worry Darlin Im an ass
man
Sheriff Storch takes off his belt and unbuckles his pants
He kneels down behind her
Jennifer SHRIEKS as her face contorts with a completely new
level of pain as her head is thrust back down
Then out of the corner of her eye Jennifer catches a
glimpse of the Sheriffs GUN still sitting in its holster
Her eyes immediately go to Stanley whos busy swapping out
the MINI-DV tape and replacing it with a new one--
hen she sees Matthew leaning against a tree a vacant look
in his eye twisting a rubber band through his fingers
Andy site on is ass playing his harmonica Her eyes
continue to scan the area for Johnny whos nowhere in sight
hen immediately her eyes dart back to the GUN

-

ISOYG PINK 102909 45a
As Jennifers body is being jerked back and forth she
reaches - and reaches - closer with each stretch when--

ISOYG PINK 102909 46

A heavy work boot comes down on her hand crushing it
Jennifer looks up

Johnny glares down at her then unzips his pants as he moves
in closer to her face

JOHNNY
No teeth Show Horse No teeth
Her vision grows hazy The sky water and ground all seem
to meld together

TO BLACK
BACK IN ON
44 EXT FISHING HOLE - LATER 44

Cruel laughter brings Jennifer back to Somehow she manages
to lift her head to see Stanley pulling up his pants

ANDY
Wow Stanley 30 seconds Must be
a record for you

JOHNNY
Dont you know you should wait for
the lady

STANLEY
Bitch was too tight even after
yall Sides shes all bloody
I wanted to finish up

ANDY
Right and we thought Matthew here

JOHNNY
Dont be so proud of yourself Andy
I clocked you at just over two
minutes
Jennifer musters up her last ounce of strength and gets to
her feet The men all stare impressed at her resolve
Jennifers torn clothes hang loosely off her body as she
staggers away and wanders aimlessly away from them Its a
miracle she can even walk

continues further down the bridge

A45 EXT BRIDGE - DAY A45

Jennifer doesnt bother to turn around She continues down

She moves to one of the railings

The Sheriff looks at her and cocks the shotgun

SHERIFF STORCH
Sorry it was fun while it lasted

JOHNNY
Yeah too bad we have to put you

The weight of the Sheriffs words register on all of them
except Matthew who oddly enough has started to come around -

as if he just woke up in the middle of this nightmare

MATTHEW
She slipped and fell
Matthew stands up nervous jittery coming unglued

MATTHEW (CONTD)

bedroom seconds later he comes out obviously empty

MATTHEW

(SCREAMS )
Where are you
Barely a second later he receives his answer

This time its definitely coming from downstairs Matthew
glances down the staircase When he sees that nobody is
waiting at the bottom he heads down there

But once his foot touches the third step the board gives

as Matthew crashes down the steps ass-over-tea kettle

MATTHEWS POV His vision is completely blurry He
the

struggles to get his bearings as he lays at the bottom of

stairs the side of his head rests on the floor A thin

line of blood has already started to run down his cheek
Matthews vision starts to come back into focus as a BLURRY
IMAGE starts to move away from him As the IMAGE gets
further away - it comes into focus - JENNIFER

We see her now wounds healed only the faintest hint of the
beating and trauma she went through

ISOYG PINK 102909 71
Matthew grunts and groans as he tries to get up--

MATTHEW

(STAMMERS)
I I knew you were alive I knew it

JENNIFER
How do you know Matthew
Matthew props himself up with his hands and manages to get
into a sitting position

MATTHEW
Huh

JENNIFER
How do you know Im alive Are you
sure yourenot dreaming again
Matthew shakes his head quickly from side to side Hes not
sure of anything any more

MATTHEW
Iam I dreaming
Jennifer pats the couch next to her

JENNIFER
Come here Come sit down
Matthew staggers to his feet Hes overcome with emotion

MATTHEW

Jennifer holds a single finger to her lips

ISOYG PINK 102909 72

JENNIFER
Shh its all okay Matthew I

fault You tried to help me

MATTHEW
I did I really did

JENNIFER
I know that Matthew Now come
Matthew sits down next to Jennifer Its almost as if some
force is controlling him Matthew looks into her eyes
He leans forwards and rests his head in Jennifers lap He
finally lets himself go like a child having a meltdown

MATTHEW

(SOBBING)
Im sorry Im so so sorry

JENNIFER
(stroking his head)
ShhI know I know you are
Matthews so caught up in the moment that he fails to

A ROPE from the tool shed with a good SLIT KNOT being snaked
around his neck

JENNIFER (CONTD)
But tell me again Matthew I want
to hear how sorry you are
Matthews eyes fly open Jennifers hands jerk backwards
The rope digs into his flesh He tries to speak but his
windpipe cant produce any sound
Matthew rolls to the floor Jennifer never loses her grasp
She stands over Matthew twisting the rope as hard as she
can His eyes bulge the veins in his face protrude--
Realizing hes about to slip away forever Matthew displays
one last burst of strength but Jennifer uses her leverage to
get her foot on his chest and pulls harder
Frightened and furious Matthew whips Jennifer around again
like

But she refuses to let go

ISOXG PINK 102909 73

Finally Matthews body has had enough He feet stop kicking
and just twitch Then he just gasps like a fish dying out of
water

Jennifer bends over Matthew Shes only inches from his
face Hes alive but in terrible shape

JENNIFER (CONTD)
(whispers in his ear)
Tell me again
CLOSE ON Matthews mouth He cant actually speak his
voice box shattered But he mouths the words

MATTHEW
(STRUGGLING)

Im sorry
JENNIFER

Im sorry Thats just not good

enough
She pulls the slip knot around his neck again and begins to

CHOKE HIM--
JENNIFER (CONTD)

something is not right

ANDY (CONTD)
Matthew
As he gets close to the water - he now sees his

He squints his eyes trying to get a better look at what is
beneath the surface --

WHOOSH SOMETHING runs right behind his back - the entire
reflection caught in the water --

Andy spins around - as he staggers into the water - no one

ISOYG PINK 102909 74A
just the calm breeze through the trees -- but then a small
outcrop of bushes rustle as if something just moved through

Andy calms - then makes his way over with purpose-

ANDY (CONTD)
Only making it worse for yourself

Andy picks up his pace as he nears the tree line - right
where he saw the movement
Out of the corner of his eye he sees another branch

unnaturally He races over--

He looks at Stanley

ANDY

79 EXT WOODS - DAY 79

Andy and Stanley run through the woods trying to find the
source of the sound

ANDY
Youre ass is grass Matthew
Branches and leaves fly by as Andy barrels through the
foliage Stanley tries to keep up but its no use
ISOYG PINK 102909 76
The SOUND changes direction - they look off to see SOMEONE
flash through the trees

ANDY (CONTD)

They race off after the sound

80 EXT WOODS - DAY 80

Suddenly the tune stops Andy stops in his tracks trying
to figure out which way to proceed Suddenly Stanley hears
another sound Crying

STANLEY
Hear that
Theyre off again About fifty yards away hidden behind the
trees is the SHACK Something slips around the side of the
structure Stanley immediately spots what he thinks is
Matthew

STANLEY (CONTD)
Matthew

ANDY

Andy races ahead leaving Stanley trying to catch his breath
behind him

there are remnants of recent life
someone

ANDY
Matthew Where the fuck are you

ISOYG PINK 102909 77

Under the table is a pile of filthy old clothes It almost
looks like a makeshift pillow

He picks up a moldy tin can which once contained some
preserved meal He tosses it to the ground

82 EXT DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 82

Stanley waddles out the back of the shack He stops About
twenty yards away and sees JENNIFER leaning against a tree

STANLEY
Why you little bitch
Stanley races over - Just as Stanley gets close - SNAP A
hidden BEAR TRAP clamps down on Stanleys leg - the pain is
intense as he screams out - He staggers backwards and falls
to the ground in agony

STANLEY (CONTD)
Oh God Oh my fucking God
ON ANDY As he exits the Shack to see Stanley on the ground
writhing in pain

STANLEY (CONTD)
Please Andy My fucking leg
Andy races over to assist him As he offers Stanley his
hand he notices Stanleys eyes catching a glimpse of
behind him But as soon as he turns the wooden BAT the one
from the fishing hole catches him flush across the face
Hes down and before Stanley knows it she cracks him in the
back of the head

Andys eyes flicker open He sees a hand wrapping a rusty

wire around the contact of an old car battery Then he

up and sees a bare light bulb flicker on

Hes draped lengthwise over a horse trough so his torso is
completely over the basin His arms and legs are secured
with ropes

ISOYG PINK 102909 77A

Suddenly the sound of RUSHING WATER from inside the trough
Andy looks down A dirty hose hangs over the mouth of the
trough Brown water flows from it Filling it

ANDY

(PAINED SCREAMS)
Help Somebody Help me

ISOYG PINK 102909 78
His nose and face are busted - it hurts to scream
With the trough filling up quickly Andy realizes it wont

long until the water is above his head
He cranes his neck upwards After all were he to stay face
down he would drown -- just like Jennifer wouldve

84 EXT DILAPIDATED HOUSE DAY 84

STANLEYS POV Its Jennifer and in her hand is his video
camera

JENNIFER
I know You like to watch Dont
you Dont you worry Ill give
you quite a show
She sets the camera on top of a tri-pod right in front of
face frames up and hits record She looks up to him
Stanleys arms are tied behind a tree his head is held in
position duct tapped back against the tree

His legs are anchored to the ground The bloody mangled one
still in the bear trap that bites and gnaws at his leg with
every move

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Since you like to watch
She flips the monitor of the camera toward him just like he
did to her
She stands in front of Stanleys face Stanley wants to say
something but his pain is too intense

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Cant talk can you Well maybe
its because youre hungry
Jennifer goes to grabs something behind her

JENNIFER (CONTD)
You know you have to eat some real
nasty shit out here to stay alive

STANLEY
Bbbb bitch Let me go
She grabs his nose and pulls open his mouth shoving a MAGGOT
INFESTED RODENT into his mouth

ISOYG PINK 102909 79

JENNIFER
Whats wrong you dont like it I
prefer the maggots to the meat
Jennifer site down next to Stanley She glances over to the
monitor to see what he is looking at Then she reaches over
and into a burlap sack
Stanley stares straight ahead at the monitor in front of
him
Jennifer reaches into the burlap bag and takes out a roll of
fishing line Then she takes out a pack of fish hooks
Stanleys eyes go wide
Jennifer removes the hooks from their package She holds one
between her thumb and forefinger and studies the barbed tip
Smiling to herself she threads the hooks with fishing line
STANLEY
Whwhat are you doing with that

JENNIFER

(LAUGHS)
Oh just some fishing I know
how much you guys like to fish
Finally when shes finished she scurries behind Stanleys
head From behind him she grabs his eyelid and pulls it
away from the eyeball itself

STANLEY
What are you Please dont
Then she pops the hook through the lid and pulls the fishing
line back over his head
Stanley screams something fierce as she continues to thread
his eyelid open slowly methodically delivering as much
pain with every pull of the line from one eye to the next
His eyeballs bulge unnaturally twitching wildly--
All Stanley can do is stare ahead and watch himself on the
monitor

JENNIFER
Ill be back before you have a
chance to blink
Jennifer stands up and brushes herself off and walks to--
WITH ANDY Jennifer comes over and slaps him in the head

ISOYG PINK 102909 80

She pulls his head back up

JENNIFER (CONTD)

Jennifer gets real close to his ear--

JENNIFER (CONTD)

JENNIFER (CONTD)

She slams his head back down again and holds it then up--

JENNIFER (CONTD)

She holds his head down for a very long time as his body
struggles - then up
Andy gasps for breath as Stanleys screams get louder--

JENNIFER (CONTD)

She walks off--

Jennifer climbs onto his back and GRABS his hair pulling his
head up

JENNIFER

Andy tries to buck her off gasping for breath buckling
under her added weight Jennifer slams his head back into

He tries to look at the bird to see what it is doing but he
cant move
ON THE MONITOR The CROW has jumped onto Stanleys head -
looking at his eyes -- It begins to peck at them Stanley

Jennifer brings forth the bucket

ANDY

JENNIFER

Jennifer pours the lye into the bucket - the fumes make Andy
gag But he holds his neck up as long as he can - he does
not want to put his face down

Jennifer come around in front of him

JENNIFER

Andy strains to keep his head faced at her

Jennifer laughs and walks out of the shack as Andy gasps
chokes and spits for his life as-
STANLEYS head is covered in crows

revealing a face burnt red puffy oozing puss skin flaking

a skimpy outfit gets out of the truck She pops the hood
obscuring her once she does
Johnny sits up in his seat

A truck is parked at the pump Its hood is up and a woman
leans over the engine Her ass is perfectly framed in a
tight miniskirt from which two long flawless legs descend
into a pair of blood-red high heels

Johnny walks over to her wiping his hands on his bandana as
the woman shimmies her hips almost inviting him to approach
her And Johnny being Johnny doesnt need much

Johnny is close enough to touch her He snickers a bit
never taking his eyes off her ass

JOHNNY
Can I fill it up for you maam
The woman wears sunglasses and slowly turns to Johnny
Johnny takes a long look from bottom to top - and when he
gets to her face - it registers - but before he can do
anything Jennifer swings a tire iron and catches him right
across the jaw
A handful of teeth ejected by a spurt of fresh blood as
Johnny falls face-first into the ground

88 INT DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 88

Johnny is buck-naked His hands are tied tightly together
and pulled above his head running through an eye hook that
has been screwed into one of the shacks wooden beams His
eyes flicker

Jennifer walks up to him right to his face

Its date night

Johnny cranes his neck and twists his body to see whos
there

as Jennifer walks out of the shadows She saunters up to

Johnny

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Your mouth doesnt look so good
Maybe you should--
With a massive TUG she pulls back on the bridle that bites
into his raw bloody mouth

He grunts out a hellacious scream as his body bucks wildly

JENNIFER
Oooh youre an ornery stallion

Jennifer tilts her head and looks at him as you would a
fascinating piece of art

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Guess Im gonna have to tame you

JOHNNY
Bithh
With a bunch of teeth missing Johnnys lisp is pronounced
Jennifer saunters around him seductively She removes
something from behind her back and brings forth a rusty pair
of pliers
Jennifer steps closer

JENNIFER
Oh thats the problem You still
have some teeth left Were gonna
have to fix that
Jennifer clamps thepliers down tightly on Johnnys tooth
He tries to move but between the bridle cutting into his
mouth and the pressure on the tooth its sheer agony
Jennifer jerks her hand from side to side squeezing the
tooth as hard as she can in the pliers Finally the root
breaks free of the pulp and Johnnys tooth is extracted
Johnny flails around in severe agony

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Save your strength You got a few

more races to run

Johnny screams something unholy Jennifer holds the tooth up
in the air and inspects it

JENNIFER (CONTD)
I have to admit I didnt think it
went that far down
Jennifer sticks the pliers in again latching it onto
another
tooth

ISOYG PINK 102909 86

Johnnys eyes bulge with fear as he kicks and screams
pulling

his shackles taut --

Jennifer rips down on the pliers - her face is splattered

with blood as the tooth comes free

Jennifer discards the tooth and goes right back--

JENNIFER (CONTD)

PLEATH--
As Jennifer begins to extract yet another tooth Johnnys
weary body convulses in so much pain that he actually pisses
himself

JOHNNY
Pleathfor the loth oth thod

JENNIFER

Thats disgusting Even your boys

didnt piss themselves Be a man

will you

Jennifer takes the bridle and yanks Johnnys around the
pain

is so bad he can hardly fight He grimaces and spits out a

mouthful of blood at her

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Now thats not gonna get you a
sugar cube

Aw whats the matter Show Horse

She takes the gun and caresses it across his face his chin
and then she SHOVES it in and out of his mouth

ISOYG PINK 102909 87

JENNIFER (CONTD)

Like you really mean it
Johnny finds renewed strength and starts to buck and writhe
ABOVE The eye hook is starting to pull loose
With every touch of motion white-hot pain courses through
Johnnys body

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Breathe through your nose It
helps You know like it was your
first time
Johnnys body flails with all his might as-
ABOVE The eye hook loosens a bit more--

JOHNNY

JENNIFER
I hear sometimes a stallion can get
a little headstrong They dont
want to be trained refuse to be
broken

(BEAT)
But everyone has their breaking
point dont they

(BEAT)
You just have to find it Theres
a way to break any animal Do you
know how they do that with horses
Do you Johnny I do
She walks away from Johnny and picks up the rusted old
gardening sheer
She walks back to Johnny menacingly slicing the sheer
open closed And again

JENNIFER (CONTD)
You slice off every ounce of their
foul manhood
She slices it closed again
As Jennifer closes in the look in Johnnys face says it
all
But there is simply nothing he can do about it

ISOYG PINK 102909 88
Jennifer gets even closer looking at Johnnys eyes as she
reaches down towards his penis--—

JENNIFER (CONTD)
You geld them
SLICE - Johnnys eyes rolls back as he SCREAMS
She holds the piece of limp pink flesh in her hand
Despite everything hes been through this brings forth an
entirely new level of pain He screams and bucks as the
EYEHOOK continues to loosen
Jennifer bends down for a moment bringing something up from
the floor She comes back to a screaming Johnny as she--

SHOVES HIS CASTRATED PENIS INTO HIS MOUTH
as

shut

JENNIFER (CONTD)
No teeth show horse no teeth
Johnny flails with all his might screaming spitting as--
ABOVE The eye hook finally gives way Johnnys tied hands
come crashing down directly on top of Jennifer
Jennifer goes flying with a bloody enraged Johnny now free

he grabs and claws after her

Jennifer desperately kicks and scratches to get away from
this hideous blood-soaked monster - but Johnny grabs hold
onto her leg - he drags her closer as she loses her grip--
With one solid kick Jennifer connects with Johnny in the
face - he sprawls out from pain - as she gets up and races
out the door - Slamming it closed as she exits She leans up
against it holding it closed

89 EXT DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 89

Within seconds the door is kicked at banged at punched at
Johnny screams wildly from inside as-- Jennifer holds it
with all her strength

Slowly the cries and banging fade until there is nothing but
silence

Slowly she slides down on her bottom exhausted spent and
completely devoid of all emotion

a modest recreation area that has seen better days
Sheriff Storch jumps out of the car still leaving it
of

stiff

running and sprints into the park

A few feet away an empty swing blows gently in the breeze
The metal brackets screech loudly with every movement
Sheriff Storch spins around in circles a maelstrom of
confusion He looks around frantically for anything that
will give him a clue as to the whereabouts of his daughter

95 INT SQUAD CAR - DAY 95

Sheriff Storch gets back inside He immediately picks up the
CB But just as he opens his mouth to speak lie glances in
the rearview mirror His eyes meet Jennifers

Before he can turn Jennifer pistol whips him in the temple
He falls forward his head smacking into the steering wheel
The HONKING of the horn echoes throughout the empty park

96 INT DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK 96

Sheriff Storch comes to Blood trickles down from the side

his head

Hes bent over the table pants at his ankles His SHOTGUN
propped up behind him with the barrel inserted into his ass
With every move a scorching pain courses through his body

Sheriff Storch speaks through gritted teeth

JENNIFER

SHERIFF STORCH

JENNIFER

Jennifer walks behind the Sheriff She wraps her fingers
around the barrel of the gun and shoves it in deeper
The Sheriffs expression is one of unbridled agony Jennifer
continues to sodomize him with the shotgun

smile - nearly imperceptible but its there creeps across
her face

SMASH OUT
