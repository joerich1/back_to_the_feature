a sign that reads “CONGRATULATIONS DAVID” It sparkles

ADAM
No Maybe

CHRISTINA (0S)

I think it’s sweet

QUINN (0S)

Across the way a RED PRIUS with a BIG BOW across the hood
pulls in to the lot A hot BRUNETTE comes barrelling out of
the DMV holding her new license above her head

BRUNETTE
(yelling)
OhmyGod OhmyGod OhmyGod

Her DAD gets out of the car and hands her the keys They hug
Quinn VOICES both sides of the conversation

QUINN (0S)
Daddy Oh my God You are the best
We had a deal didn’t we you keep up
a C-Minus average and I buy you a
new car This is perfect for giving
hand-jobs in Only the best for my
little girl

A BLONDE pops out of the car Quinn continues

QUINN (0S) (CONTD)
(as BLONDE)
Now we can finally go off and make
out I know lets go right-- Owww
Sonofa

The camera pans over to CHRISTINA RILEY 15 a firecracker
who clearly just kicked him in the shin
QUINN (0S) (CONT’D)
What was that for

CHRISTINA
Do you have the ability to hear the
words that come out of your own
mouth

QUINN (0S)
No I do not

ADAM
Here he comes

A STUDENT DRIVER Sedan pulls into the parking lot DAVID 17
drives with the DMV EXAMINER next to him David’s got honor-
student written all over him He gives the camera a slight
nod as if to say “nailed it” Adam holds up the sign

QUINN (0OS)
That’s my boy--

--BANG

ALL (0S)
OHHHHH

The camera whips revealing the Prius and Sedan have COLLIDED
into each other The Brunette gets out of the car pissed
The Examiner immediately takes out his RED PEN

The camera lands on Adam’s sign as he flips it over
revealing the words “BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME” It sparkles

QUINN (0S)
Maybe that side didn’t need
glitter

ADAM (0S)
Yeah that makes sense in hindsight

David comes around the camera and takes a look focusing on a
BLONDE bent over

Grey New Jersey skies loom out the hallway windows as
STUDENTS file into school

The BELL rings
CUT TO
INT EDISON HIGH - SCIENCE LAB

Clusters of TEENS chat and gossip away the lab period
ignoring their earnest teacher DR HARRIS 30s

ADAM (0S)
That’s complete F-ing BS

QUINN (0S)
Calm down Egghead Take a breath

In the corner David Quinn and Adam have expertly
constructed a MAKESHIFT MECHANICAL ARM It’s pretty clear
they’re about a million miles from popular

ADAM
A-holes What about scholarships

David holds up a STACK OF FORMS Quinn takes a look

QUINN
This one says you need to be Native
American
(to Adam)
Hit it
DAVID
I was born and raised in New Jersey
how much more native to America can
I get

Quinn slips on a Diode-laced glove Adam flips a switch and
Quinn begins a barrage of LEWD HAND GESTURES The mechanical
arm mirrors him almost perfectly

DAVID (CONTD)
It’s not quite in sync yet

ADAM
Give me a pen

Adam fiddles with the arm Whatever he does works

QUINN
Youre like the Asian McGyver

ADAM
Mc-Who

David looks towards Dr Harris there’s an odd resemblance
even down to their clothes David sighs

DAVID
That’s going to be me isn’t it
Teaching high school science to a
bunch of Jersey douchebags

QUINN

Listen I will gladly donate
sperm 7 days a week if necessary
to help you pay for school

DAVID
That’s very generous of you

QUINN
I’m wasting it now anyway

Dr Harris makes his way over to the guys

DR HARRIS
Hey Guys really great work here
Outstanding stuff

ALL
Thanks Dr Harris

DR HARRIS
David I heard about MIT I’m sorry

DAVID
It’s my SAT scores I should have
retaken the test
DR HARRIS
You think Einstein would have cared
about the SAT Have you
considered entering the ISA

DAVID
The science fair

DR HARRIS
You get AP credit for entering and
the winners get all 4 years of
school paid for It’s a tough
competition but I’m sure you guys
could come up with something great--

--CRASH Harris shouts towards the other side of the lab

DR HARRIS (CONTD)
--Hey Hey Alex Weber this is a
classroom not a cage match
(back to guys)
Anything you need from the school
it’d be at your disposal Think
about it

CUT TO
INT EDISON HIGH - HALLWAY - LATER

The Guys shuffle past an incomplete MURAL OF THOMAS EDISON’S
name Some STUDENTS are just starting to PAINT it in

QUINN
No Definitely not If you enter
that thing you will be putting a 24
month moratorium on losing your
virginity

DAVID
Quinn we graduate in 8 months

QUINN
That’s how severe it is there’s a
16 month residual effect Besides
the only kids who win those things
are home-schooled psychotics or
robots from China No offense

ADAM
I’m Korean

QUINN
See We’ve got no chance

his hoodie Revealing a BEST BUY GEEK SQUAD POLO

CHRISTINA (CONTD)

David peeks over at Quinn’s homework-- something’s off

DAVID
Why the hell are you doing 9th Grade
Algebra

QUINN

What are you a cop
A bunch of VARSITY JACKETS pass by Oddly one stops and
lingers over their table JAKE STABILE the QB he’s
probably thrown more food at this table than spoken to it

JAKE
(to Quinn)

QUINN
(trying way too hard)
What up Jball You catch that

QUINN
Awesome Thank you Jake

Jake walks off

DAVID
Did you really just thank the guy
whose homework youre doing

QUINN
Maybe He’s a teammate

DAVID
Youre the Assistant Manager not a
tight-end
QUINN
So I help Jake with a little math
he helps me with my social life
It’s win-win

DAVID
Maybe you guys should focus on
winning a game

QUINN (0S)
Look Wannemaker’s party is tonight
Jake’s hooking me up

DAVID
The only thing Jake’s hooking up is
your head to your own ass
Besides I have to study

QUINN
Oh you presume I was even inviting
you No I was just telling you

ADAM
Ill go

QUINN
Damn right you will

Quinn throws Adam a pound but Adam misses it

CHRISTINA
David don’t you think you should at
least attempt to go to one high
school party before you gee I don’t
know graduate high school

DAVID
(enough)
Alright Ive got to finish these
apps I’ll see you guys later

Davids grabs his things and walks past the Popular Table as

Jake slips out his foot David TUMBLES

over his uniform The LAUGHTER comes from every direction

JAKE
Oooh tough break Geek Squad

David just stands there for a second the humiliation

clinging to him He gathers up his things and takes a long

walk out of the room

INT DARK BASEMENT - LATE NIGHT

A dark labyrinth of DUSTY BOXES and OLD SCIENCE ARTIFACTS
Christina tries the switch no luck She tip-toes down the
stairs Suddenly she hears a CREEEEK and freezes

CHRISTINA
Hello

Chris uses the light on her camera to try and get a better
look when suddenly a FLASHLIGHT clicks on blinding her

CHRISTINA (0S) (CONTD)
Ahhbhh

The flashlight drops revealing David rummaging through a
pile of boxes

CHRISTINA (0S) (CONT’D)
You scared the crap out of me What
are you doing down here

DAVID
Nothing

CHRISTINA
Don’t be so acerbic

DAVID

Don’t use SAT words on me

CHRISTINA (0S)
Still upset about the lunchroom
then I told you social suicide

DAVID
Thanks for the advice

Chris takes a peek into the boxes

CHRISTINA (0S)
Why you going through Dad’s things

DAVID
It’s dumb There’s this science
fair winner gets a scholarship I
thought maybe there was something in
Dad’s stuff

David pulls out a framed MIT Diploma honoring BENJAMIN RILEY
He eyes his reflection in the glass

CHRISTINA
It’s not dumb Everything’s gonna
work out

DAVID
-I don’t know Chris What if all
the work and studying-- if it just
doesn’t matter What if this is as
good as it gets
CHRISTINA
David this is not as good as it
gets I promise you
David turns back to the boxes a little embarrassed

DAVID
Sure

CHRISTINA
Don’t be such a--

--WHAM SOMETHING HEAVY falls to the floor

CHRISTINA (CONTD)
What the hell is that

Lying on the ground is an old STEEL BRIEFCASE The kind for
carrying things other people aren’t supposed to see

He wipes away the dust revealing faded black letters
US DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
It just hangs in the air for a minute

DAVID
Open it

CHRISTINA (0S)
»-You open it

David tries the locks it won’t budge

CHRISTINA (CONTD)
His birthday Yours Mine

David keeps spinning the wheels but it’s not opening

DAVID
Nothing Not Mom’s either

He lifts it up and gives it a quick shake something
rattles inside of it

CHRISTINA
What the hell is in there

CUT TO

INT DAVID’S BASEMENT - LATER

The lights reveal the room once a workshop has become the
family’s go-to storage unit - half filled with boxes David
and Adam hover over Quinn’s shoulder as he works to jimmy the
locks

CHRISTINA (0S)
Where did you learn to pick a lock

QUINN
Youtube

CLICK CLICK Quinn takes a bow The case pops open just a
sliver A slow pulsing glow creeps through

CHRISTINA
Wait What if it’s a bomb

QUINN
It’s not a bomb

David takes a deep breath and ever-so-gently lifts the lid
revealing

AN OLD FILE stamped TOP SECRETEYES ONLY

And a sealed GLASS BOX containing an intricate web of WIRES
CIRCUITS and FLASHING INDICATOR LIGHTS

QUINN (CONTD)
OK maybe that is a bomb

David carefully lifts the Glass Box out of the case He sets
it down on the worktable-- suddenly every metal object on the
table flies towards it

ADAM
Jesus

David rips it away

DAVID
I‘1l just put this back

David takes out the file and begins to flip through the
yellowing pages Adam and Quinn read over his shoulder

DAVID (CONTD)
These are machine schematics

QUINN
I thought your dad designed toys

DAVID
So did I

ADAM
This doesn’t look like a toy

CHRISTINA
David look

Resting in the foam hidden where the Envelope laid sits a
VHS video tape labeled

DAVID
(reading)
Project Almanac Location 44 Bravo

Quinn grabs the tape and makes for an old TV and VCR in the
corner of the room He plugs it in to the wall

QUINN (0S)
If this is porn it’s mine

They all gather around as the tape begins
INTERCUT WITH VIDEO FOOTAGE (ON SCREEN)

EXT DESERT EXCAVATION SITE - 44 BRAVO - NIGHT (CAMERA POV)

An Old Desert Cemetery The camera pans revealing a MASSIVE
EXCAVATION CREW next to a slew of OPEN GRAVES

The camera crosses to a work area where COMMANDER ROSS 50s
more military than scientist argues with a MAN 20s whose
back is to the camera

COM ROSS
Doc at a certain point we stop
replacing machines and start
replacing the guys running them

MAN
I should be so lucky we blew a
rivet should be 4 more hours
The man turns around and faces the camera

CHRISTINA
Holy shit That’s Dad

Suddenly there’s a commotion from the crew - they’ve found
something David’s Dad (BEN) and the CAMERA MAN run over

BEN
What do we got

The team is unearthing an OLD PINE COFFIN from a shadowy
gravestone The camera swings past a date 1891

Ben steps forward and takes a crowbar to the coffin hoisting
it open Dust flies out some of the Men “cross” themselves

CHRISTINA
(scared)
What what are they doing

The dust clears revealing a SKELETON arms crossed around a
SMALL CANVAS SAC clutched to his breast

BEN
Well I’11 be damned

He reaches in and carefully removes the satchel A team of
SCIENTISTS rush him over to the sterile work table

Ben reaches inside the bag and his eyes pop wide his hand
emerges with a YELLOW DUCK KEYCHAIN with an LED light

COM ROSS
Oh my God

He reaches in again and removes an iPhone covered in dust

BEN
You ever seen something like this
before
Ross shakes his head “No” Ben pulls out one last thing a

WALLET He flips it open and stops dead like he’s seen a
ghost

COM ROSS
What is it Riley What is it

The camera zooms in on his hand holding the wallet open to a
student ID belonging to DAVID RILEY - CLASS OF 2013

INT DAVID’S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

David pauses the screen on a CLOSE UP of HIS ID They’re
stunned into a long silence Davids head is spinning

CRASH A distant noise from outside makes them all jump
David takes a deep breath

QUINN
David Let me see your wallet

David hands his ID to Quinn It’s an EXACT MATCH

ADAM
How did your wallet get to 1993

DAVID
How did my wallet get to 1891

Nobody knows

QUINN
So what the hell are these
blueprints for

They guys slowly make for the worktable Quinn pours over the
schematics for some clue

QUINN (CONTD)
(Reading)

Solenoid Accelerator Temporal
Navigation Panel

ADAM
Temporal Navigation Wait that’s--

DAVID
--Time Travel

They all look to each other in disbelief

ADAM
So then these are blueprints for--

QUINN
--A time machine

David and Adam join Quinn laying out the pages like pieces
to a puzzle

QUINN (CONTD)
We have to build this thing

DAVID
What are you crazy We have no idea
what this thing actually does

CHRISTINA
So lets find out

DAVID
Not you too Guys we can’t build
this thing were just a bunch of
kids in a basement in New Jersey

QUINN
--No were not You got into MIT
Egghead here is a genius and I have
certain qualities

Davids mind is going in a million different directions

DAVID
Lets just put all this away who
knows--

QUINN

--OK you’re right Lets just put
all this back where we found it The
blueprints the videotape the glass
thingy the blast-proof briefcase
stamped “Property of the Department
of Defense” Lets just go back up
stairs and order a pizza

DAVID
Quinn--

QUINN
--David How are you not in the
least bit curious Think of it
People with time machines they
don’t have to worry about money for
college or about studying the
don’t have to worry about anything

David takes a long look at the pages

DAVID
It’s just it’s not possible All of
it We can’t build this thing

Quinn looks David square in the eye

QUINN
Did you watch the tape I think
we already did

She flashes the screen

CHRISTINA (0S)
How--How does it work

JESSIE
So this is the controller it’s the
brain of the machine You plug in
your time coordinates here and you
put your spatial coordinates--

CHRISTINA
--Spatial coordinates

DAVID
Space and time form a 4 dimensional
continuum--

JESSIE
--English David They’re linked so
you can not only go to a different
time you can go to a different
place

CHRISTINA
Can we go check out the future

DAVID
No Only to the past It works like
a boomerang You can travel to the
past and then you have to return to
wherever you left from

CHRISTINA
Lame Can we go check out the 20s

DAVID
Uh no We’re building this on a bit
of smaller scale They had uranium
and we have power cells We have to
run tests but it can probably go
about 2 weeks back

Wow What was it like back then Did
they have cars two weeks ago

David pulls TWO STOP WATCHES from his pocket one RED and one
BLACK He clicks them simultaneously starting the timers

He places the Red Watch around Barbie’s neck and then joins
the group huddled behind a makeshift barricade Quinn slips
on a Football helmet

QUINN
Safety first

DAVID
Right Here we go

The group collectively holds their breath as David grabs the
trigger-- CLICK CLICK Nothing happens

ADAM
Maybe it’s not--

The Machine BURSTS to life A WHITE GLOW spreads from the
Glass Circuit into the WORMHOLE GENERATOR spinning into a
BUBBLE OF ENERGY pulling at everything around it

Christina crosses the room filming through the water-like
vortex It’s getting noticeably unstable

DAVID
Holy Shit OK - NOW

THE CORVETTE launches up the RAMP vanishing INTO THE VORTEX
just as it snaps shut Christina whips to the “X” expecting
the Corvette to reappear but nothing comes

LIV
Where the hell’s my Barbie

Chris scans the room when suddenly a FLASH appears on the
wall revealing the Corvette sticking halfway out

JESSIE
So it’s a little off Not horrible

David carefully reaches for the Red Watch He looks at them
side-by-side The Black Watch reads 120055 the Red Watch
reads 021335 and counting

Youre missing the point

QUINN
Which is what

ADAM
You can’t go back and give yourself
information about the future

QUINN
Well have you seen Terminators 1
through 4 Because that’s sort of
the whole point

ADAM
That doesn’t make any sense

QUINN

Right because it makes perfect
sense that we should take time
travel lessons from Jean Claude Van
Damme

DAVID
Can you both just stop It doesn’t
work and it’s not going to

--Nothing happened and you know it
Jake

JAKE

I wouldn’t say nothing of course I
wasn’t the one wasted off my--

JESSIE
--Screw off

JAKE
Oh c’mon don’t be like that

Jake grabs her backpack playfully holding her back David
without even thinking steps forward and SHOVES Jake

DAVID
Get off her

Everybody freezes even the passing CROWD David stands there
stunned quickly second-guessing his outburst

JAKE
Geek squad Really

Jake steps in Davids face towering over him

JAKE (CONTD)
We got a problem you and me

David can feel all eyes including Jessie’s on him

JAKE (CONTD)
What is it You got a thing for rich
girls Good taste but she’s a little
worn in

David’s whole body clenches

JAKE (CONTD)
Look at you tough guy Tell you
what Ill give you the first shot

Jake waits to see if David’s man enough to make a move but
nothing comes David’s too scared and Jake knows it

JAKE (CONTD)
That’s what I thought Pussy

Jake walks off bumping David as he passes David looks to
the crowd of on-lookers the humiliation stinging until
his eyes land on Jessie’s and then it’s just so much worse

CUT TO
INT DAVID’S BASEMENT - NIGHT
The machine lays across the worktable in pieces Quinn and
Adam work to bring it back to life Across the room David

does his homework trying to ignore them

ADAM
Ok Now try

Quinn flips a switch and the WORMHOLE GENERATOR revs up but
then just as quickly dies

DAVID
Youre wasting your time Even if
you fix it it won’t work right

Quinn hands Adam his screwdriver and pulls a seat up next to
David Like an infant David turns away

QUINN
You wanna talk about it

DAVID
Not really No

David shifts in his seat

QUINN
Look Dave Assholes like Jake
Stabile - every school’s got one
and you know where they always end
up Pumping your gas or mowing your
lawn I mean I almost feel bad for
the guy He’s doomed

David sighs but finally gives a little
DAVID

Thanks but in truth I really
wish I punched him

QUINN
Yeah me too

JESSIE (0S)
--Me too

David turns to see Jessie at the door She slowly steps in

JESSIE (CONT’D)
Hey

DAVID
Hi
It’s awkward if only for a moment Quinn gives them some

space

JESSIE
I uh I didn’t want to bother you
I just wanted to come by and say

thanks--
DAVID
You don’t have to--
JESSIE
--Yes I do

She gives him a “Thank You” PECK on the cheek - you’d swear
he loses his balance

DAVID
Thank you David I brought you
something

DAVID (CONT’D)
Huh You brought me something

JESSIE
You need a lithium diode battery
right

DAVID

I mean yeah but

Jessie turns towards the window framing her parked Prius
Adam and Quinn follow her gaze

DAVID (CONTD)

Jessie that’s really nice but even
with that were still nowhere close
to figuring out how this thing--

JESSIE

--About that Don’t you think it’s
strange that the blueprints never
mention that the Drive Circuit is
magnetized

DAVID
Drive Circuit

Jessie walks to the worktable and grabs a MAGNET

JESSIE
I named the Glass thingy It was
that or Jessie-Tron 3000 I got to
thinking

She puts the magnet about an inch from the Glass Circuit
Behind the glass a HIDDEN TOGGLE SWITCH slides out

DAVID
What the hell is that

JESSIE
With something this powerful this
secret you’d want to make its
functionality as cryptic as
possible to protect it

She rotates the Toggle and it CLICKS into place Suddenly the
entire Glass Circuit GLOWS BLUE

JESSIE (CONTD)
We were trying to drive this thing
while it was still in neutral

David just stands there amazed Quinn grabs his screw
drivers and makes for the car outside

JESSIE (CONT’D)
Uh Quinn don’t you need my keys

QUINN
Not really no

SMASH CUT TO
EXT GAZEBO - NIGHT
CAMERA POV
Everybody gathers near a small park perched just above the
lights of their small neighborhood It’s the kind of place
teens go to do things they don’t want any adults to see

DAVID
Are you recording

Christina pans to David
CHRISTINA (0S)
No The red light means something
else entirely

David turns revealing the machine in the Radio Flyer--
GLOWING They all stand on edge paralyzed with nerves

JESSIE
David Are you sure about this

The camera lingers on David just thinking about that

DAVID
No But I want to see what
happens I want to find out

David reaches for the trigger and looks to see if anybody’s
with him but nobody makes a move David nods fully
accepting that he’s going alone

CHRISTINA
Wait I’m coming too
QUINN
Me too
ADAM

You think it causes cancer

QUINN
So does everything awesome

ADAM
Ok I’m in

LIV
Me too

Everybody looks to Jessie the last hold out She bites her
lip It’s now or never

JESSIE
-You’d screw this up without me

They all look to one another part scared part excited
Something in Quinn’s eyes looks a little off

DAVID
Quinn You alright

QUINN
Nothing it’s just If something
bad happens I want you to know
It’s been an honor serving with all
of you

ADAM
We’re not really serv--

QUINN
--Don’t ruin this

DAVID
Ok Anybody else

They all shake their heads no

JESSIE
I think we’re good

DAVID
OK Here goes nothing

CLICK FLASH The machine HUMS to life The VORTEX unfurls
almost supernaturally hanging peacefully in the air
practically inviting them inside

One after the other they all step through Finally the
camera goes in STATIC then

Everybody emerges in the exact places they were just standing
- like somebody pressed a reset button Everything looks
exactly the same

DAVID (CONTD)

The camera switches to NIGHT-VISION The room is a teenage
war zone Liv notices the nudie posters on the wall

LIV
Elegant decor

Quinn grabs a SHARPIE MARKER from the desk

DAVID
Quinn What are you doing

QUINN
Trust me Watch this

Quinn gently pulls back the sheet revealing a SLEEPING TEEN
SNORING under the sheets his face buried in a pillow

ADAM
Be careful Don’t wake him

Quinn leans forward with the pen and begins to DRAW a SMILEY
FACE on the back of the SLEEPER’S NECK

DAVID
Jesus Quinn Stop

JESSIE
Oh My God Get that Get that

The camera whips to the back of QUINN’S NECK where pen
markings SIMULTANEOUSLY APPEAR out of thin air They forma
SMILEY FACE looking about a day old

The teen rolls IT’S ANOTHER QUINN

THEY HAVE TRAVELLED ONE DAY INTO THE PAST

The camera flashes around wildly as the group bolts

They burst out of the front door as Quinn’s Dog LEAPS to the

window BARKING WILDLY They all TUMBLE to the ground
catching their breath as the camera lands on its side

Quinn’s heaves turn to LAUGHTER and it spreads to the
whole group
JESSIE
Oh my God We just travelled back

in time
A grin spreads across Davids face

DAVID
We did It’s It’s yesterday

Adam smiles They all do

ADAM
It’s yesterday

Quinn gets to his feet and yells for the whole world to hear
QUINN

LIGHTS come on all around the neighborhood Up above Quinn’s

window slides open and PAST-QUINN pokes his head out

searching for the noise

DAVID
Oh shit

They all RUN LAUGHING as they book it around the corner

JESSIE
Alright lets get outta here before
they lock us up

They all gather around the wagon David grabs the Trigger
Chris pans the camera across their proud faces

DAVID
Not bad for a bunch of idiots from
New Jersey

He pushes the Trigger-- THE WARP FLASHES TO LIFE They all
file in and the camera cuts to STATIC

INT DAVID’S BASEMENT - THE NEXT DAY - BACK TO PRESENT

David and Quinn use a power drill to fasten a BOLT LATCH onto
a wooden cabinet in the corner of the room David slides a
BIG LOCK on the latch and tests it out

QUINN
Tight like a--

DAVID
--I’m gonna ask you not to finish
that sentence

QUINN
Fair enough So who gets the key

DAVID
Well seeing as how you seem to be
getting good at breaking and
entering I’1l hang on to it and
well call it even

QUINN
Alright that’s fair Better

David considers this for a moment Quinn notices
DAVID
Baby steps Quinn Everything’s
connected if we win someone else
doesn’t

QUINN

DAVID

David heads back up stairs Quinn calls after him

QUINN
One word Dave “Stretch Hummer”

DAVID (0S)
That’s two words

INT DAVID’S BEDROOM - DAY (CAMERA POV)

The room is a meticulous shrine of studying David has the
camera locked off framing his room perfectly square Barely
noticeable is a thin blue line that bisects the frame

in from another DIMENSION He poses like a magician

QUINN

whiteboard covered with DIAGRAMS and EQUATIONS

DAVID
Liv could you maybe not do that

JESSIE
Honestly who has a whiteboard in

their room

DAVID
What I actually use it a lot

JESSIE
Seriously you need to take some
drastic measures towards loosening

up

CHRISTINA
You have no idea Look under his
bed it’s all Chem books no porn
for miles

DAVID
I have por-- never mind

David pulls at his collar suddenly very self conscious

LIV
I don’t get it Where’s Quinn

DAVID
He went back an hour It’s a test of
cause and effect You’re not going
to believe this

CHRISTINA

But where exactly did he go
DAVID

Suddenly David’s ALARM CLOCK goes off They all look to each
other oddly nervous
JESSIE
That’s the signal Chris start
filming

CAMERA POV

Everybody stands frozen waiting on pins and needles
Christina pans around the room looking for something

Suddenly a poster on a wall POPS UPSIDE DOWN-- Then ANOTHER

CHRISTINA (0S)
Oh my God

A NOISE sparks her attention On the shelf BOOKS SHUFFLE
themselves into a new order as the room bursts to life

- Instantly the LIGHT BULBS become BLACK LIGHTS illuminating
the room with an eerie purple glow

- Davids FISH TANK snaps into a GLASS OF WATER with a
goldfish inside

- Jessie sits in a DESK CHAIR that instantly BREAKS a leg and
tips her over

The room quiets for a second They all stare at each other
amazed at what they just witnessed

JESSIE
Tell me you got all that--

CRACK Chris zooms to the window behind David as it spiders
When the camera zooms back David’s PLAID SHIRT has
transformed into a SOLID BUTTON DOWN

CHRISTINA (0S)
David Your shirt

David looks down to his shirt as Quinn bursts into the room

QUINN
Did it work

Quinn looks around and sees the wreckage

DAVID

I said change one or two things
QUINN

I’m sorry I got carried away The

window was an accident

DAVID
And the ceiling

Christina pans the camera up towards the ceiling revealing
the words “ADAM HEARTS PENIS” written in BLACK-LIGHT PAINT

He looks like hasn’t gotten much sleep in days He rolls out
of bed and sits down at his computer He eyes the pile of
SCHOLARSHIP FORMS still waiting to be filled out

DAVID
(reading)
Describe a life changing event that
defined the person you are today

He stares at a blank Word Doc trying to muster up anything
meaningful when his eyes land on a PICTURE FRAME resting at
the back of his desk

ANGLE ON THE PHOTO
It’s DAVID 7 Years Old sitting on his DAD’s lap blowing
out the candles on his BIRTHDAY CAKE but that’s not what
he’s looking at There’s something in the background
something inside the house a PERSON

CUT TO
INT DAVID’S BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER
David stands alone digging through a box marked “2003”
He pulls a video labeled “DAVID’S 7TH BIRTHDAY” pops it in
the VCR and hits rewind As he waits he keeps looking

through the box and finds a NEWSPAPER CLIPPING from 10 years
ago The headline reads LOCAL TOY FACTORY BURNS KILLING 11

with a picture of his Dad below

THE TAPE BEGINS TO PLAY

It JUMPS and SKIPS like it’s been recorded over A magician
A cake that reads “Happy Birthday” A 7 YEAR OLD DAVID blows
out his candles and gives his Dad BEN a hug

The camera pans past the back of the house - DAVID HITS
PAUSE He rewinds it back and leans in real close

The FOOTAGE moves frame by frame as the camera pans by
Davids living room windows and for a fraction of a
second deep in the living room mirror is DAVID age 17

DAVID

How is that possible

CHRISTINA (0S)

DAVID (0S)
Back here

JESSIE
Sorry I think I just left my Calc
notes here yesterday and I--

Jessie steps around the corner revealing the room full of
POTTED PLANTS David sits on the floor Machine at his side
He’s made some modifications it now fits into a CAMPING
BACKPACK

JESSIE (CONT’D)
Are we starting a nursery

DAVID
I’m trying to calculate the battery
strength you know to see how far
we can go with a full charge

David pulls away a blanket on the ground between them
revealing a large “X” made of duct tape and the words “DO
NOT TOUCH” spray painted in front of it He takes out a POT
OF DIRT and pours a GLASS OF WATER on it

David presses the trigger opening a wormhole between the two
of them He casually PUSHES the pot through the warp towards
Jessie When it emerges it has SPROUTED into a VIOLET
Jessies eyes light up

JESSIE
That’s amazing

They both look up at the same time catching each other’s
eyes both seeing something in the other for the first time

JESSIE (CONT’D)
H-How far back can we go

David counts the plants and then types on a calculator

DAVID
(sotto)
Two weeks plus 12 that’s 18
(deflated)
Only about 90 days

She looks at the machine genuinely impressed by him

JESSIE
Some particular place you want to
go

Davids glances towards to the TV

DAVID
No Woodstock maybe

JESSIE
You No way I could see you more in
the 1950s Sock-hops Leave it to
Beaver Sputnik

DAVID
Gee thanks What about you

JESSIE
Me I don’t know I’d just use it
to have a never-ending summer you
know no more winter mornings

She stares at him for a second noticing his Geek Squad polo
peeking out from beneath his hoodie A little smile forms

DAVID
What
(realizing)
Don’t say it

JESSIE
I just imagine you coming to the
rescue of some poor old woman trying
to connect her toaster to her TV

DAVID
It happens more than you might
think

She LAUGHS You’d swear they were leaning towards each other
ever so slightly Jessie notices it and catches herself

JESSIE
I uh I should probably get going

She reaches for her CALC BINDER but it slips from her fingers
and falls to the floor

JESSIE (CONTD)
Shit

DAVID
Here I got it

David hands it to her She gives him a slight smile

JESSIE
Thanks I’1ll see you later

DAVID

She slips out the door giving him one last look as she does

Frozen rain pours down outside as David sits in Calculus -
the only smiling face in a sea of misery His TEACHER drones
on and for the first time in David’s life he’s not paying
attention in class David watches the clock tick to Noon

His HAND shoots up

DAVID
(interrupting)
--I have to go to the bathroom

David nods He pulls Redand Black stopwatches discreetly
from his pockets and CLICKS them starting them in sync

the counter and the red one around his neck

QUINN (CONT’D)

David holds up the Backpack as if that’s his answer
DAVID
(to Christina)

The two smile at each other not quite sure where to look

DAVID
-Can I ask you something

JESSIE

That is asking me something

DAVID
(nervous )
Right How come you’re so good
with computers

Jessie eyes him deciding if she can trust him

JESSIE
After my mom passed it was just me
and my dad He’s a programmer and
not much of a people person
Teaching me to code was his way of
teaching me how to braid hair It
was what he knew best Now it’s
what I know best

DAVID
But why do you keep it a secret

JESSIE
It’s not a secret I don’t exactly
broadcast it but It’s
complicated Smart people don’t get
invited to parties

DAVID
Why do you want to go to parties

JESSIE
Because they’re fun David You
should try it sometime
David fiddles with his watch

JESSIE (CONTD)
Ok my turn What’s with the watch

David looks down his nervous tick caught

DAVID
(struggling)
Huh Oh It’s nothing My Dad gave

it to me just before he died I was

Jessie looks upon him with an understanding gaze She reaches
around her neck and pulls at a LOCKET She opens it revealing
an old picture of what must be her Grandmother

JESSIE
From my Mom when I was 9 Belonged
to her mom

The two look on sharing something special Their hands brush
up against each other She leans in ever so slightly

JESSIE (CONT’D)

A blue glow flashes behind the handicapped stall and out
steps the whole group back into the light of day-- sun-kissed
and grins plastered across their faces The rain continues to
fall outside but somehow they don’t seem to mind

Jessie unlocks the door and they all head back to class

INT CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

David steps back in It’s exactly as it was when he left He
takes his seat as his Teacher continues to BORE the students

David discreetly pulls the two stopwatches from his pockets
dropping clumps of wet sand on the floor

The red watch reads 090914 the black one reads 000241
He’s been gone for 9 hours but to the teacher the class

David clears the frame revealing his computer

The focus pops in and out finally settling on AN INTERNET
TRADING SITE The page is open to a STOCK PORTFOLIO with an
account balance of 314100

A faint BLUE GLOW flashes over the screen

The PORTFOLIO CHANGES and the ACCOUNT BALANCE ticks up to
7122 Then again to 13363

The BLUE GLOW flashes a second time

DAVID (0S) (CONTD)
Holy shit--

The tape jumps but the framing is the exactly the same still
pointed at the computer screen

The Account Balance goes from 13363 then to 21814
then to 31002

The blue glow flashes FOOTSTEPS David leans over his
computer reading the account balance

He has the money for MIT
He comes around behind the camera and for a split-second
you can see the grin splashed across his face Then the
screen goes BLACK

QUINN
You’re Stephanie Peterson right

STEPHANTE

INT EDISON HIGH —- LUNCHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The place has pretty much emptied David Adam and Chris sit
at their usual spot David eyes the POPULAR KIDS heading out
particularly Jessie She gives him a small smile that none of
her friends catch

Quinn slips in next to Adam still WHISTLING

QUINN
--It’s good to be alive don’t you
think
DAVID
What the hell’s gotten into you
QUINN
Nothing Nothing at all Any-
who I’m gonna need the keys to

the machine tonight Dad

Quinn pulls out his laptop

DAVID
Did you just call me Dad
QUINN
It’s possible It’s for an
experiment
DAVID

What kind of experiment

QUINN
What do you know about the
Hasselhoff principle

DAVID
Its Heisenberg principle

QUINN
It’s German that’s all that
matters Point is it says that just
the act of observing an event
changes the event’s outcome right

DAVID
Basically

QUINN
Problem is it’s impossible to test
because we would need to know the
details of an event before it
actually happened

DAVID
So

Quinn flips his computer around to reveal a COLLAGE OF
PICTURES from facebook of teens at a house party

QUINN
Soooo I downloaded 341 pictures and
21 videos all tagged Wannemaker’s
PARTY I’m curious to see if just by
being there--

DAVID

--Lets do it

INT WANNEMAKER’S PARTY - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

The party does not disappoint It’s massive David looks
like he actually put a little effort into his appearance -
his hair maybe his clothes

DAVID
Maybe this wasn’t a good idea

QUINN
Of course this was a good idea

He catches Quinn looking at a sheet of paper

DAVID
--What are those Notes

QUINN
No it’s my journal

David grabs the paper and reads

DAVID
You don’t have a have you been
here before

QUINN
I resent even the implication of--

Quinn’s wristwatch CHIRPS He quickly checks his iPhone
showing a VIDEO of Stephanie Peterson posing for a picture
with friends at the party Quinn looks across the room
where that EXACT MOMENT is playing out in real life

QUINN (CONTD)
Don’t worry it’ll be like we were
never here If you’ll excuse me

DAVID
(to Christina)
Where’s he going

Christina rolls her eyes

CHRISTINA
It’s a party David Try to have a
good time Don’t come back until

Ornithology books pretending to be interested but really
he’s just nervous to be at a party

He pulls a pair of BINOCULARS off the wall and scans the
crowd of people having fun Suddenly he spots Jessie She
looks beautiful her hair down and face made up David sighs

DAVID

(to himself)
One hello won’t hurt right Just a
quick “hey” see I do go to parties

Hey Jessie it’s me-- Hi How you

Adam awkwardly shoots out his hand but he gets the timing
wrong David glances over to the popular table in search of
Jessie but she’s not there

ADAM
Is the room spinning

QUINN
Yes we have it set on “low”
(re the license)
Maybe it’s a ripple effect from
going back to Wannemaker’s

DAVID
Can’t be I took my test before we
ever went to Wannamaker’s and
that’s the furthest back we’ve gone
Plus I’m not allowed to retake the
test for another week It’s not a
ripple effect it’s something else

QUINN
Well it’s not the worst thing to
ever happen Now I can finally stop
chauffeuring you around

DAVID
Yeah

David’s got an uneasy look feeling he can’t shake
DAVID (CONTD)
It’s just the weird thing is I

never took this photo

Quinn takes a long hard look at it trying to make sense of
that one but he can’t

QUINN
So how Well that is a twist
now isn’t it

David keeps scanning the room for Jessie when he hears her
voice from just over his shoulder

JESSIE (0S)
What’s a twist

-And then suddenly he feels her lips kissing his cheek

The guys come to a screeching halt They can’t even blink
Jessie tosses her books on the table and slides up to David
like it’s business as usual

JESSIE (CONTD)
I’ve been looking for you all

QUINN
--Apparently lots

Her whole body language is different She hangs on him like
a girl infatuated

DAVID
(shock)
Did you just kiss me

JESSIE
Uhm yeah Sorry am I suddenly not
supposed to do that

David is stunned Quinn just rolls with it
QUINN

--No Feel free PDA not a problem

She gazes to David trying to figure out why her boyfriend is
acting so weird

JESSIE
Everything OK with you

David is still speechless

QUINN
--He’s fine He’s just a little
freaked out a driver’s license

JESSIE
But you failed your test
DAVID
Yeah That’s that’s why it’s a

little weird

JESSIE

David hands her the License As she inspects the ID David
mouths to Quinn “what the fuck is going on” Quinn mouths
back “I have no clue”

JESSIE (CONT’D)

David longingly

She puts her hand on his leg and David jumps
DAVID
(freaked)

confused and a little upset

INT EDISON HIGH - BOYS BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Holy Shit Now that is a ripple
effect This is amazing You’re
dating Jessie Hargrove

DAVID
This is not amazing This is very
bad We’re in an alternate present--

QUINN
--Yeah a much better present Man
you should’ve punched that asshole
years ago

DAVID
Quinn between Wannemaker’s Party
and today we could have caused a
million things to change and we
have no idea what they are
Meanwhile everybody else thinks it’s
just the way things have always
been

QUINN
And David you know I love you
and you’ve been my best friend for
17 of 17 years but you have a
tendency to jump to the worst case
scenario and miss out on the good
things right in front of you We’re
not in the Twilight Zone This isn’t
some alternate universe You punched
an asshole at a party and now your
dating the hottest girl in school
That’s all Be honest with
yourself it’s what you wanted
right

David is a little embarrassed to answer but the answer is
yes

QUINN (CONTD)
I’m not sure what to tell you
except that maybe your luck has
finally changed

The BELL rings

DAVID
(not so sure)
Yeah
QUINN
Yeah I’ll catch up with you after

David watches as Quinn heads out the door His eyes go front
to his reflection The angle on the mirrors makes his
reflection look like it spins off into infinity He stares
closely at his face comparing it the picture in the license

DAVID
What did you do

CUT TO
INT EDISON HIGH - HALLWAY

David steps out just as Kids are flooding the hall He tries
to walk anonymously but somehow it feels like all eyes are
on him He spots Jessie coming out of the lunchroom and
quickly walks the other way She spots it a little stung

He steps to his locker and opens it trading out his books
for next period He’s about to slam the door when he notices
something odd on the MIT letter taped up inside

EXT BLEACHERS - LATER

David sits alone overlooking the empty football field
Computer open on his lap he holds his cell phone to his
ear

DAVID

QUINN
Ok I agree this looks bad

DAVID
You THINK This is out of control I
didn’t do this

Quinn clicks to the transaction history

QUINN
You sure about that

DAVID
What are you talking about

QUINN
Six days ago look You started with
Three thousand in your account then
you bought stocks and it went up to
31K

(MORE )

QUINN (CONTD)
Then four days ago you deposited
another 100K into your account and
made a bunch of other buys and it
kept going up It’s all here in your
account activity

Quinn looks to David waiting for an answer

DAVID
(choking it out)
I uh I I did it the first time
Ok I didn’t tell anybody

QUINN
But you said--

DAVID
--I know what I said I did it to
pay for MIT but that’s all I
didn’t use it for anything else and
I certainly didn’t run up the total
to 204 thousand dollars

David’s head is in his hands You can see it in his eyes
he’s genuinely frightened

QUINN
Dave maybe it’s just that you
didn’t do it yet

DAVID
What are you talking about

QUINN
Think about it A driver’s license
A full ride to MIT All that money
gets deposited into your account and
into stocks all of which just
happen to be big winners The
machine can travel back up to 90
days right

DAVID
Give or take

QUINN
So somewhere in the next 90 days
you go into the past and make these
changes You did this or more
accurately you will

DAVID
But the money Quinn does that
sound like me You’ve known me my
whole life I’m not that reckless

QUINN
You’re not I’1l admit it But
maybe you know what you’re doing

DAVID
What if I don’t This is all just
spiraling out of control There’s
too much that can go wrong one slip-
up and who knows--

DING DONG David glances out the kitchen and spots Jessie
waiting at the front door

DAVID (CONTD)
Oh that’s just perfect

QUINN
--Are you gonna tell her

DAVID
--Would you

And with that David trudges out to the living room
CUT TO
INT DAVID’S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR

Deep breath then David opens the door revealing Jessie
Framed in the doorway somehow she looks perfect

JESSIE
Hey

DAVID
Hey

Neither of them is sure how to start

DAVID (CONTD)
-I didn’t realize you were coming
over--

JESSIE
--No I just thought you seemed
like it was a rough day so I just
figured Id I’d pop by

David’s totally tongue-tied unsure of the right move

JESSIE (CONT’D)
(sweet)
--you know I thought I’d try the
front door today instead of the
basement

DAVID
It suits you

David looks Jessie in the eyes and he spots it She’s
crazy about him

DAVID (CONTD)
Do you want to come in

She smiles and walks in with extra ceremony flirtatious and
familiar trying to ease the strange tension in the air

JESSIE
(cute)
Not that I’m trying to put down the
basement or anything

DAVID
No of course not

JESSIE
Just thought it was more lady-like
this way See when I come through
this door I get the full effect

She crosses to the mantle taking in years of Riley family
history on the walls She looks at a photo of David and his

dad

JESSIE (CONTD)
You two look alike

DAVID
You think

JESSIE
Totally Oh that’s too cute

She stops at another photo David in diapers She laughs

DAVID
That’s uh not supposed to be up
here I don’t know how that got--

She just switches gears on him

JESSIE
--Why were you so weird today when I
sat down next to you

David stops It’s just so tempting to play the part

DAVID
I wasn’t I mean I didn’t mean to
be-- It’s just complicated very
very complicated

JESSIE
I’m a girl David I hang on every
little detail I mean I know we
didn’t have the talk and maybe it’s
weird but I like you and I thought
that you liked me too--

DAVID
--Jessie It’s not that It’s not
anything like that I do like you A
lot

JESSIE
(cute)
A lot Like a lot a lot or just
you know a lot

He smiles but starts to fiddle with his watch she notices

DAVID
Maybe Maybe I over-think things
too much I spend too much time not
appreciating the good things that
are right in front of me instead of
always thinking about what’s
missing

JESSIE
Maybe you do Maybe we all do but
sometimes good things just find us

She moves closer to him thinking he’s saying one thing but
really he means something else

DAVID
If I just kept talking right now

JESSIE
(softly)
-Don’t keep talking

David smiles regretfully

DAVID
If I kept talking it would be
alright It would all be what I
hoped it would be and you would
never know the difference

JESSIE
-David what are you talking--

Suddenly from the other room Quinn calls out

QUINN (0S)
--Dave Dave

JESSIE

DAVID
He uh he came over after school--

Quinn comes bursting out the kitchen door

right answer She slowly pieces it together

JESSIE (CONTD)
It’s not possible It’s not

(MORE)

DAVID (CONTD)
As long as we don’t ever go there
this should all erase

The guys barrel over to the cabinet when they stop dead in
their tracks The lock has been RIPPED off and the machine
is GONE

JESSIE
What the fuck Where is it
DAVID
It should be here
JESSIE
You think What did you do with
it
DAVID

Jessie I didn’t do anything with
it the lock is busted open
Somebody else must have taken it

QUINN
One of us must have it nobody else
even knows that we built this thing

DAVID
Try Adam

Quinn grabs his phone and dials it rings once and then
PHONE
This Number has been disconnected or
is no longer in service

Everybody slows down

DAVID
Try him again

Quinn dials and again
PHONE
This Number has been disconnected or
is no longer in service

JESSIE
I’ll try Liv

Jessie grabs her phone and does the same
PHONE
This Number has been disconnected or

is no longer in service

Fear starts to wash over all of them

QUINN
What the hell is going on where are
they

David grabs his phone and dials Christina It rings once
then again and then

CHRISTINA (0S)
Hello

They all breath out a huge sigh of relief
DAVID
Chris Where are you You gotta get
back here

CHRISTINA (0S)
I just stopped off at Jennys

DAVID
You have to get back here right

CHRISTINA

I’m already heading back David

DAVID
--I don’t know Somebody took the
machine and we can’t reach anybody

CHRISTINA
How could somebody take the--
And then silence The line goes dead
DAVID

Christina Christina
All the blood drains from David’s face

DAVID (CONTD)
CHRISTINA

He hangs up and dials again but this time
PHONE
This Number has been disconnected or
is no longer in service
DAVID
No I was just talking to her she
was just

Tears start to well up in Jessie’s eyes

QUINN
What the hell is going on Where is
everybody

Davids trembling hand dials Christina again but again he
just gets the recording

DAVID
God Dammit Chris

He dials once more

JESSIE
David David Stop

BANG CRASH They all freeze NOISES begin to rattle the
upstairs

QUINN
What the hell is--

BANG Without thinking David tears up the stairs Quinn and
Jessie follow

CUT TO
INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
The whole place is turned upside down OATMEAL spilled

everywhere the WATER now OVERFLOWING from the sink the TV
on the floor still on It looks like hell broke out in here

QUINN
Jesus when did this--

--BANG A noise from the next room The kids tear in to the
living room just in time to see

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Nothing It’s still Exactly as they left it

JESSIE
Is somebody here--

And then the whole room ERUPTS with a shock-wave of change
literally upending itself in real-time

CHAIRS topple themselves over The COFFEE TABLE splinters
like it was smashed A VASE morphs into pieces The MIRROR on
the wall vanishes and reappears broken on the floor
Everything on the MANTLE scatters

The whole room churns violently blowing the kids back until
finally mercifully it stops

David stares at the wreckage almost paralyzed A SHARD of
glass falls cutting the silence

DAVID
You guys you ok

They both just nod still unable to speak David takes a look
around the room for any clue as to what’s happening

JESSIE
Who did this I mean why would
somebody

She trails off as David spots something on the floor an OLD
CLOCK the face now cracked and stuck at 813 AM

DAVID
I don’t know but whoever it is
they did it 7 hours ago

CUT TO
INT QUINN’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER

David stares out the upstairs window watching the sun slowly
set behind his house across the street

JESSIE
-Who else knows about the machine

Jessie pulls out her laptop

QUINN
Nobody Not unless somebody blabbed
about it Maybe Liv decided too--

JESSIE
--She wouldn’t do that

DAVID
(to Jessie)
What are you doing

JESSIE
Being a genius - the machine
controller is an iPhone It has a
locator app

David comes around and watches her load the GPS screen

QUINN
(on tangent)
I’m just saying I know it wasn’t
me I know it wasn’t David Adam
never speaks and--
JESSIE
--Well how do we know it wasn’t
you

DAVID
GUYS

On screen the words come up “PHONE NOT FOUND”

JESSIE
Shit

QUINN
They’re obviously not going to leave
it on Genius

JESSIE
Well they would have to if they were
using the machine Moron

DAVID
Guys will you shut the hell up

Jessie and Quinn give each other a nod Truce

JESSIE
Why would somebody even do this

DAVID
I don’t know but they’re trying to
get rid of us Get rid of anybody
that knows about the machine

QUINN
We need to find a place to hide

DAVID
It won’t matter

QUINN
What do you mean

JESSIE
They’re catching us in the past when
we least expect it Only by a matter
of hours It’s why David’s whole
house turned itself upside down
That’s how Christina vanished in the
middle of a phone call Looking over
your shoulder won’t do any good

QUINN
-You think they’re dead

Jessie and David look to each other afraid of what the
answer to that might be

They all just sit there not sure what they’re waiting for
or what to do next David’s phone BUZZES with a text from
“MOM”

DAVID
(reading Text)
Home by 10 Cant reach Chris - is
she with you How do I explain
this one

JESSIE
We should call the police

QUINN
And say what Somebody stole our
time machine and is out to get us
I’m sure they’1l get right on it

David puts his phone back in his pocket when suddenly he
stops He feels around in his right pocket then his left

QUINN (CONTD)
You lose something

DAVID
Yeah
David freezes
JESSIE
(realizing)

David where’s your wallet
You can see him retracing his steps

DAVID
In my jacket which I gave to
Christina last night

JESSIE
The tape
(to Quinn)
Do you still have--

QUINN
--Got it

Jessie springs over to Quinn’s desk Quinn whips open his
laptop and three of them converge on the screen as he starts
playing the 44 Bravo tape

First Liv’s key chain appears then an iPhone and finally
there is David’s wallet

DAVID
Son of a bitch Play it again

Quinn starts the file over David scans for any small detail

JESSIE
There’s no way that they could get
that far back It’s not possible
The machine can’t--

DAVID
--Somehow they must have They left
us these things for a reason They
knew wed be watching this They’re
trying to tell us something

ON SCREEN
The men hoist the coffin out of the ground

JESSIE
Wait Go back Just about 3 seconds

Quinn scrolls back frame by frame just as the camera swings
past the TOMBSTONE It’s fuzzy but you can just make out a
set of ROMAN NUMERALS

DAVID
What is it

JESSIE
Those numbers on the tombstone

He clicks forward one more frame and suddenly they’re clear

QUINN
(reading)
M M X I I and then CCCXI1V
T

David and Jessie start to count it out in their head

JESSIE

M that’s a thousand 2 M’s--
DAVID

Two thousand--
QUINN

2012 and 314T T’s not a roman

numeral
They both look to Quinn surprised He holds up his iPhone

QUINN (CONTD)
Google

DAVID
Thats them What the hell could
314T mean

Quinn keeps clicking back until he lands on the NAME of the
tombstone

JESSIE
(reading)

The phone falls from David’s ear

DAVID
(to Jessie and Quinn)
You guys aren’t gonna believe this
(back in to the phone)
How late are you open

CUT TO

INT LANDON WALTERS CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

It’s now raining outside Quinn David and Jessie all sit in
oversized chairs The THUNDER makes them even more nervous A
lawyer sits opposite them handing paperwork to David to sign

LAWYER
(pointing to the contract)
Sign here here here here and
here and initial here I would
ask you for ID but according to the
paperwork you no longer have your
wallet

The three of them share a knowing look David finishes
signing and the lawyer hands David a key

JESSIE
How long have you had this here

LAWYER
Well It looks like it was left
here in 1899 as bequeathed by Ms
Christina Riley She your great
grandmother

DAVID
Something like that

Suddenly a clerk comes in with a large METAL BOX

LAWYER
I’1l leave you alone

The three of them all gather around David inserts the key
and opens the lock inside is something wrapped tightly in
cloth and string Jessie takes it and begins to unwrap

Cloth piles up on the table until there in her hands is
Christina’s Camera

DAVID
Way to go Chris

The POWER CORD is still with it Jessie runs and plugs it in
David pushes the POWER button It feels like an eternity and
then finally it SPRINGS TO LIFE

They all huddle around the small screen David’s hand shakes
as he presses PLAY

ANGLE ON SCREEN

Static Then DESERT The camera pans around like it’s
trying to find it’s bearings but it’s just a barren
landscape Christina’s voice can be heard

CHRISTINA (VO)
What the hell is

She gets up and tries to walk but she falls back down in
WAILING in pain

JUMP CUT
EXT OLD WESTERN TOWN - NIGHT - ON SCREEN (CAMERA POV)
The camera hides behind what look like barrels in an old
western slum It must be over 100 years ago It’s gruesome

and terrifying Chris jumps afraid of every little thing

QUINN (0OS)
She’s really she’s really there

The sound of HORSES whip by Christina crawls on her hands
and knees trying to find a safe hiding place Far off in the
distance some MEN stumble out of Saloon and start to brawl

Chris grabs the camera and turns suddenly face-to-face with
a FILTH COVERED DRUNKARD CAWING and pointing at the strange
looking girl

JUMP CUT
INT OLD WESTERN TOWN - NIGHT - ON SCREEN (CAMERA POV)

The camera is now indoors but it’s too dark to make out the
space A GUNSHOT is heard in the distance Christina rolls
over the camera falls on it’s side

She hits the night vision and pans it around It looks like
she’s in an abandoned hay loft CRASH - somebody bangs into
the side of the building Chris jumps but catches her
scream

Hands shaking she picks up the camera and looks right at it

CHRISTINA
(terrified)
I don’t know if David if you
find this rewind the tape I
love you

STATIC

INT LANDON WALTERS CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
David rewinds it back and hits play

ANGLE ON SCREEN

The DMV TEST it plays for a second and then David fast
forwards through FOOTBALL PRACTICE the MIT LETTER OPENING
THE BRIEFCASE EXPERIMENT 1 Suddenly it’s DAVID AND JAKE
FACING OFF AT SCHOOL

JESSIE
I don’t remember that happening

DAVID
I didn’t realize she shot that
I guess technically it didn’t happen
anymore

JESSIE
You stood up for me twice

David just shrugs not sure to take credit for it Barbados
comes up on screen Then it’s the morning after the party
Christina checks herself out in the viewfinder-- then
suddenly the whole image becomes SHAKY David hits PLAY

ANGLE ON SCREEN

INT DAVID’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS

Somebody’s RUNNING with the camera Tearing through Davids
house for dear life CRASH BANG Furniture topples over

DAVID
Jesus

It’s hard to make out what’s going on The camera runs
downstairs through the living room into the Kitchen The
place begins to get trashed amidst the chaos The camera
backs out and then falls to the ground Christina SCREAMS A
BLUE GLOW starts to crawl around her She turns over for a
second and then STATIC

BACK ON DAVID
He grab the camera

DAVID (CONTD)
There was somebody there There was
a face

They watch carefully as the tape slowly moves back frame by
frame The carnage coming in reverse there’s a person a
man and then finally we can see

It’s DR HARRIS - David’s teacher

DAVID (CONTD)
He was right there at the very
start He was watching us all along

David sets the camera down

QUINN
See Never trust teachers Rule
number one

Jessie pulls out her laptop and starts googling him looking
for any information

DAVID

He’s not an idiot He must’ve
figured out a way to travel further
than we could

QUINN
How

DAVID

He could’ve taken his time to figure
out a way Who knows how long he’s
really been travelling for He could
literally be gone for years and to
us it would be the blink of an eye

JESSIE
There’s nothing on this guy

In the background the paused tape begins to play

DAVID
He could have erased it he could’ve
changed his identity We remember
him but who knows what he’s turned
into-- Holy shit Look

There on Jessie’s screen is the window she used to “FIND MY
PHONE” Suddenly there’s a small BLUE DOT FLASHING

JESSIE
The controller’s on That’s
school He’s going to use it
again

DAVID
That’s it

Jessie closes her laptop and pulls out her Phone

JESSIE
We gotta move fast I can keep track
on this--

She looks over to Quinn who just stands there watching the
video play He looks like he’s seen a ghost

JESSIE (CONTD)
Quinn What What is it

He turns the camera around revealing a shot of THE OLD
WESTERN TOWN On screen is QUINN being dragged across the
town by THUGS beaten and battered Christina SOBS as she
films trying to stay hidden

Back in the room Quinn touches his collar He’s wearing the
same clothes in the video as he is right now

QUINN
It feels so strange Like you’re
numb

David reaches out for his friend but in an instant he’s
gone EVAPORATING INTO THIN AIR The camera drops to the
floor still playing the scene until it goes to STATIC
CUT TO
EXT EDISON HIGH - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

David and Jessie watch the school from a distance At this

hour the building looks dark and abandoned Jessie checks
the MAP on her iPhone The blue dot is still there

JESSIE
He’s in the Main building or at
least the machine is

DAVID
Yeah

She notices David fiddling with his watch She reaches over
and puts her hand on his He looks up catching her eyes

JESSIE
I don’t know if I thanked you for
standing up for me twice
DAVID

It really wasn’t--

JESSIE
--Sure it was I know you didn’t
mean for for you and me-- Anyway
Thank you

David just nods Still with a heavy heart about everything

DAVID
We should go

INT EDISON HIGH - NIGHT

Jessie and David creep inside careful not to make a sound
Jessie stops and looks at her iPhone trying to match up the
blue dot to her surroundings

DAVID
(whisper )
Where is it

JESSIE
(whisper )
I don’t know This thing can only
get within--

BANG They both jump but it’s only the air coming on
JESSIE (CONTD)
Only within about 15 feet It looks
like it’s on the left hand side

David looks down the hall on the left is nothing but
lockers

DAVID
I don’t see anybody Call it

Jessie nods She starts dialing then it RINGS

JESSIE
Do you hear--
DAVID
Shhhh
They listen close it’s faint but there’s something there

They start walking down the hall

DAVID (CONTD)
Do it again

Slowly they keep walking down the hall getting closer and
closer until it dawns on David where it is

DAVID (CONTD)
It’s my locker

David quickly dials in his combo and opens the door

DAVID (CONTD)
Empty

JESSIE
There’s something there up top

David reaches to the top shelf and finds the iPhone
controller now detached from the Machine and a THICK
MANILA ENVELOPE marked “David”

JESSIE (CONT’D)
He knew we were coming He knew we
would find it

David opens the envelope revealing PASSPORTS and a pair of
AIRLINE TICKETS David flips open one of the passports and
it’s his photo but the name says DAVID RALIEGH

DAVID
(realizing)
It was him

Jessie inspects the tickets

JESSIE
(Re the ticket)
That’s not my name It says Jessica
Harbeck

David shakes out the envelope and a series of newspaper
clippings slide out The first headline reads SEARCH
CONTINUES FOR NEW JERSEY TEENS and next to that are pictures
of all the kids including DAVID AND JESSIE

DAVID
This is from three days from now

They flip through the rest of the clippings all marked with
notes and highlights

JESSIE
Two weeks next month two months
they just keep going They’re all
from the future How is that
possible

David’s mind races trying to put it all together

JESSIE (CONTD)
What’s he trying to-- is he setting
us up David David

David looks to Jessie and suddenly we know something’s
clicked

DAVID
No I don’t think that’s it

David takes everything and puts it back in the locker and
shuts the door

DAVID (CONT’D)
No matter what happens next I want
you to trust me ok

JESSIE
What are you talking about

DAVID
I think I know how to stop him
Follow me

EXT EDISON HIGH - ROOF TOP - NIGHT

David and Jessie emerge out of a service door onto the roof
of the school instantly tripping an ALARM in the building

JESSIE
David What are we doing up here

DAVID
Keep a look out
(pointing)
You check that way

Jessie scans the cold darkened rooftop for any sign of
Harris David watches her to make sure she’s safe then he
turns to his left and slowly marches across the roof

Jessie turns and spots him getting closer to the edge but
unexpectedly he does not stop walking

JESSIE
David

He keeps going

JESSIE (CONTD)
David

He reaches the edge closing his eyes and stepping up onto
the railing

JESSIE (CONTD)
DAVID NO You’1l kill yourself

And then suddenly a VOICE cuts through the air

VOICE
Shell be dead before you hit the
ground David

David freezes he hears the unmistakable CLICK of a GUN

VOICE (CONTD)
He won’t actually kill himself He’s
not that high up he’1ll survive but
he’d be paralyzed from the waist
down

David turns and sure enough there pointing a gun at
Jessie’s head is Dr Harris

DR HARRIS
It is an honor and pleasure to be
face to face with the young man that
invented time travel

DAVID
I didn’t invent it

DR HARRIS
No that’s true but you have no
idea of the magnitude of your
contribution Neither will anybody
else but it’s better that way

Jessie tries to wrestle herself free Harris’ back is
revealed he has a MACHINE It’s sleeker wrapped into a
black micro-lite backpack but with the unmistakable blue
glow Harris notices David spot it

HARRIS

It’s upgraded You guys did great
work but then I have some years on
you

DAVID
So what’s your plan then kill her
too

DR HARRIS
Kill I resent that I’m not a
murderer Technically they all died
of natural causes

DAVID
Those are my friends
DR HARRIS
They were your friends Believe me

I wish there was another way But
they could not be trusted none of
you could be trusted

DAVID
And my sister

DR HARRIS
She was my sister too David but you
don’t know what I do It doesn’t all
end happily You had to have
suspected that

Jessie replays that last sentence in her head

JESSIE
Wait what does he mean his
sister too David what does he
mean

She looks to David praying that it isn’t true David reaches
down and picks up a small shard of BROKEN GLASS His hand
trembles and he slowly presses it to his face Blood begins
to roll from just below his eye And then a scar appears
just below Harris’

DR HARRIS
I remember what it was like the
first time I got the money for MIT
How in the blink of an eye our life
changed forever but then I had to
save Jake and She forgot
everything it was like nothing ever
happened but I remembered I
knew Who do you think she ends up
with David Not you Everybody else
gets what they want in the end but
not you They betray you David
After all you did for them

DAVID
I don’t believe you

DR HARRIS
You don’t have to

Harris raises the gun

DAVID
You can’t shoot me

HARRIS
But I can shoot her David I can
live without her can you You
forget I know what you’re thinking
There’s no choice here There’s
nothing left for you to go back to
You go my way you’ll have
everything you ever wanted We’1ll
work together you’ll know
everything before it happens and
youll have the means to capitalize
on that knowledge You’1l get out
of New Jersey David and youll
never have to look back

Harris looks at the Gun Police SIRENS growing louder and
louder

DR HARRIS
Go downstairs take everything from
the locker and leave Both of you
and if you do everything right then
well never have to come face to
face again

Harris steps closer to David The SIRENS are only a minute
away he has to decide now Harris cocks the gun

DR HARRIS (CONTD)
Or we could end this right now and
live the rest of our life behind
bars

He puts the gun to Jessie’s head David looks out into the
night to the flickering lights of his school his town his
world He turns toward the Door but then stops

DR HARRIS (CONTD)
The only person you’1ll have to
blame will be yourself

DAVID
No I’d blame you

Almost on cue Jessie KICKS Harris in the shin and David
leaps across tackling him to the ground The two wrestle
when Harris flips David onto his back and points the gun

right at David’s head

DAVID (CONTD)
If I die you die

The two struggle for control of the gun as Harris tries to
aim towards David’s shoulder

HARRIS
That doesn’t mean I can’t shoot you
David it just means I can’t kill
you

Suddenly Jessie grabs onto Harris’ backpack and yanks him
off of David Harris goes spinning onto the ground He leaps
up and starts FIRING at Jessie barely missing

David gets to his feet charging Harris this time reaching
around for the backpack and pulling it over his head locking
his shoulders David knocks the Gun to the ground He dives
for it but Harris kicks it away before he can reach it

Harris swings himself around and in doing so his arm comes
free of the machine He charges David pushing him up against
the railings edge The railing starts to give

David grabs for the loose end of the machine pulling it from
Harris - it’s a tug of war Harris looks down towards his
feet spotting the gun but so does Jessie She makes for it

Harris tries to spin David into her to try and cut her off
David crashes into Jessie She gets slammed against the
broken railing It finally gives Jessie loses her balance

DAVID
Jessie

David reaches for her but she’s slipping too fast She tries
to cling to David but she’s just pulling him over with her

JESSIE
DAVID

David loses his footing reaching for the rail but missing
he’s about to slip clean off the roof when he does the only
thing he can he reaches for Harris grabbing the loose STRAP
of the machine as he and Jessie fall right over the ledge

DAVID
Hold on Jessie hold on

David looks up and spots Harris trying to pull them back up

DR HARRIS
Look at me look at me David Do
Not Let Go

JESSIE
David Don’t Don’t let him pull us

up

Harris keeps pulling but the weight is too much for him
Jessie clings to David’s midsection

DR HARRIS

There’s too much weight David I
can’t hold both of you You have to
let her go

DAVID
Fuck you

Harris begins to shake the Backpack trying to loosen Jessie

DAVID (CONTD)
Just hold on to me tight Jessie
Don’t let go whatever you do do
not let go

There’s no way for David to turn It’s a lose-lose situation
David looks up and that’s when he spots something peeking
out from the backpack The Controller

David flicks the zipper open just a few inches and the
controller falls loose It’s just close enough that he can
reach it but he has to let one hand go

Harris spots it

DR HARRIS
Over my dead body

Harris looks to his left and sees the gun lying on the
ground six feet away He yanks David and Jessie closer to
the top of the roof buying him a few inches to the gun It’s
just past his fingertips

JESSIE
David

DAVID
Hold on

Again they get dragged David looks at the controller trying
to put everything else out of his mind and just enter where
he needs to go For a moment time slows down David spots
Harris inching closer to the gun David reaches his hand to
the touch screen he closes his eyes for a moment and then

starts entering

Harris’ fingers reach the barrel He turns to aim the gun
towards Jessie when his eyes go wide

David has the shard of glass right against the Strap He
pierces the fabric and quickly it cuts all the way through
David and Jessie hang free in the air for a moment Harris
screams out David pushes the trigger and the blue glow
starts to unfurl David spins the bag around opening the warp
beneath them They fall towards the ground faster and
faster And then

revealing David’s house Something about it seems fresh
almost new

END CAMERA POV
EXT DAVID’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
They stand at the front door David goes to put in his key
but it’s already unlocked The door creeps open just an inch
and David hesitates just a moment

JESSIE

This was the only thing I could

think of the only thing I knew that

could make everything right
David pushes the door open
INT DAVID’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
VOICES and MUSIC waft in the air but the house is empty of
people They step further in now able to see through the
windows into the backyard

Christina 4 His DAD comes over and gives them a hug
THEY WATCH

JESSIE
That’s you

DAVID
Yeah That’s me and that’s Chris

JESSIE
--and that’s your father

David spots BEN as he films the party It takes every inch of
his willpower to stop from running out there He turns away
only to find his own reflection in the LIVING ROOM MIRROR

DAVID
This was always supposed to happen
We’re in a loop We have to end it
We have to destroy the file so it’s
never found not today or any day
after It’s the only way that
everything will be undone

JESSIE
Isn’t there another way We’1ll have
never built the time machine We’1ll
never even be able to

DAVID
I know

David nods He looks BACK OUTSIDE

Ben answers his cell phone looking instantly concerned He
hangs up and then WHISPERS to Kathy

KATHY

Right now

Ben nods “yes” apologetically giving Kathy a kiss He holds
her close for an extra moment then turns towards the house

BACK ON DAVID

DAVID
We gotta move quick

INT DAVID’S HOUSE - OFFICE

They move to a little study off of the living room and start
digging through the place Jess unloads a cabinet kneeling
down to check under the desk when suddenly

Ben appears in the doorway

BEN RILEY
What are you doing in my house

David turns He hasn’t heard his father’s voice in eleven
years and now they’re face to face David tries to speak
but nothing comes

Ben stares at his face realizing just who is standing there

JESSIE
(trying to help)
We thought we may have left our
Briefcase Maybe you’ve seen it

Ben looks to Jessie He understands what she’s saying

BEN RILEY
I think I think maybe I have

His eyes shift towards the hall closet with a knowing look

DAVID
Dad

Ben instinctively turns at the word He smiles at his boy
Davids eyes start to well up

BEN RILEY
David

They look upon each other realizing all that’s aligned to
make this moment David doesn’t want to miss his chance

DAVID
Dad don’t go You’re gonna leave
right now and when you do you--

BEN RILEY
--I know David I know I’m so
sorry I can’t be there for you But
it’s not the end for you and I it’s
only the--

YOUNG DAVID (0S) DAVID
--Dad --But How

YOUNG DAVID 7 bursts through the door and runs up to Ben

YOUNG DAVID
Where are you going

BEN
--Caught me pal I won’t be gone
too long

Young David turns to David and Jessie in his father’s office

YOUNG DAVID
Who’s that

BEN RILEY
Those are my friends Pal They
just came by to fix something

David’s ears perk up at that How does he know Young David
spots David’s watch

YOUNG DAVID
He’s got a watch just like yours

David looks to his wrist and to his father This was that
moment His father gives him a smile

YOUNG DAVID (CONTD)
Don’t go Dad It’s my birthday

Ben kneels down eye-to-eye with his young son

BEN

wasn’t real important But I have

Ben smiles at his son so eager just like he was

BEN

Ben looks his grown son right in the eye

BEN (CONT’D)

YOUNG DAVID

Ben takes the OLD WATCH off his wrist and gives it to his
son gives the boy a hug then steps outside heading to his
car Young David holds up his wrist for David to see

YOUNG DAVID

DAVID

BEN (0S)

Both Davids turn instinctively hearing their name

BEN (CONTD)
Make sure you take care of your
little sister It’s what Big
Brothers do

YOUNG DAVID

Young David runs back to his party and older David knows
he’s right David keeps his eyes locked on his father
getting in his car and driving away

JESSIE
You ok David

David snaps back

DAVID
Yeah I’m-- I’m ok

David opens the hallway closet revealing the STEEL BRIEFCASE
resting on the top shelf It looks pristine practically
brand new

CUT TO
INT BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

They enter this familiar place only now its set up as Ben’s
workshop David pulls over a metal trash can Jessie places

the video camera to the table mistakenly hitting the RECORD
BUTTON the tiny red light flashes

David pops open the case it’s all there The FILE the
CIRCUIT and the VIDEOTAPE

JESSIE
So that will undo everything right
You and me

She crosses over to David as he places the everything into
trash can He douses the pile with lighter fluid and then
pulls out a pack of matches He looks to Jessie

DAVID
Well find each other I know it

He lights the match lowering it to the can

JESSIE
I don’t even know what to

They look deep within each others eyes They breathe in and
KISS for the first and last time

The FLAMES GROW and slowly the three become undone
EVAPORATING away from this place until there’s only the
faintest sense that they were ever there

The room lies still But something is out of place
Something remains Its the blinking red light of
CHRISTINAS VIDEO CAMERA

ANGLE ON THE VIEWFINDER

The camera lies on it’s side capturing the quiet room A
minute passes with no change in the frame save a gentle wind
“LOW BATTERY” flashes

BLACK THEN

INT DARK BASEMENT - LATE NIGHT

A labyrinth of DUSTY BOXES and OLD SCIENCE ARTIFACTS

Christina tiptoes down the stairs when suddenly-- a CREAK
from across the room A FLASHLIGHT clicks on blinding her

CHRISTINA (0S)
Ahbhhh

The flashlight drops revealing David rummaging through
boxes of old Science Artifacts

CHRISTINA (0S) (CONT’D)
You scared the crap out of me What
are you doing down here

DAVID

CHRISTINA

DAVID

CHRISTINA (0S)

DAVID

Chris takes a peek into the boxes

CHRISTINA (0S)
Why you going through Dad’s things

DAVID

thought maybe there was something in
Dad’s stuff

David pulls out his dad’s framed MIT Diploma
CHRISTINA

work out

DAVID
-I don’t know Chris What if all

the work and studying-- if it just
doesn’t matter What if this is as

good as it gets

CHRISTINA

gets I promise you

WHAM He trips knocking SOMETHING HEAVY to the floor

CHRISTINA (CONTD)
