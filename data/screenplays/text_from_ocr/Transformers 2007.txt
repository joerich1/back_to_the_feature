Al A LEGEND appears “ONE MILLION YEARS BEFORE THE DAWN OF MAN” Al

Sunlight begins to creep onto the screen revealing a STRANGE
SYMBOL Like a complex glyph Slowly we WIDEN to reveal

It’s one of MANY Etched onto a metallic surface The symbols
can only have come from an ALIEN CIVILIZATION

We hear a VOICE powerful noble Though we don’t know t yét
it’s the voice of OPTIMUS PRIME a

OPTIMUS (VO)
Our planet was destroyed by the ravagam
of war a war waged between the leggona
who worship chaos and those of us hd
follow freedom

As the light grows it illuminates an IMMENSE SQUARE MASS A
CUBE Covered by the symbols Hurtling thrwgh SPACE

OPTIMUS (V0) ONTD)

We battled for rule of a stinger power
The Energon Cube Its o in is unknown
to us yet it bears the iets force that
created our race we “ought until our
world was awash ip death antil the very
ground swallowed those aur once-mighty
cities and the cwhe was lost to the
limitless starg-

The cube plunges into an QSTERBIDAL GROUPING and ever-so
slightly NICKS one of the Fegxs bounces in a new direction

OPTIMUS (VO) (CONTD)
Then by Mertwne or fate its course was
altered D¥iwn to a planet called
‘Rarth

REVEAL -- in the distance -- a familiar blue marble The cube
SCREAMS past wy recketing toward our planet

seserts of time hoping to find it before
