“Walkabout”
TEASER
Moving through the “0” of the “LOST” TITLE as we HEAR
CHAOS -- people shouting wailing in pain a woman screaming
the WHINE of a jet engine then
EXT BEACH - DAY 42

XCU - A MAN’S EYE as it snaps open (deja vu) CUT WIDE to
see it belongs to

LOCKE lying by the side of the smoking fuselage We quickly
realize this is right after the crash A FLASHBACK And
we’re experiencing it from his point-of-view Dazed he
props himself up on his elbows and glances around taking
stock of the other terrified survivors including the
screaming SHANNON etc until suddenly he notices

HIS POV - His feet One of his shoes is missing
Locke stares dumbly at his socked foot for a moment then
He slowly wiggles his big toe Then all the toes

He barely has time to process his parts are working before he
spots something CUT WIDE--

OVER HIS SHOE lying nearby on its side -- its CLEAN
PRISTINE UNSCUFFED SOLE facing camera

Oblivious to the panicked people running past him Locke
retrieves the shoe then sits up

Amid the din we may notice a new sound - A DOG BARKING It
starts faint at first then grows progressively louder as
Locke slowly bends his knee bringing his foot into his lap

As he proceeds to put his shoe back on we PUSH IN the
BARKING becoming louder more frantic

--and LOCKE looks up

EXT BEACH - NIGHT 43
CLOSE ON LOCKE sitting on the beach -- lost in his own
thoughts -- SNAPPED OUT by the sound of VINCENT barking He

looks over at

WALT holding VINCENT back as the dog strains at his leash
A groggy MICHAEL sits next to him
LOST Walkabout (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 71504 2

MICHAEL
Walt ya gotta keep that dog quiet

WALT
I dunno what’s the matter with him
(pulling on leash)
C’mon Vincent-- Cut it out

Michael offers an apologetic look to Shannon and Boone a few
feet away

MICHAEL
Sorry

SHANNON tsk with annoyance BOONE nods understandingly

We get QUICK POPS of some of the other regulars stirring
awake to the commotion SAYED CLAIRE HURLEY JIN and SUN
etc That’s when we find

JACK already up And staring at something KATE appears
from behind and sidles up next to him

KATE
What is it

She follows his gaze to see he’s looking at

THE FUSELAGE From inside we hear NOISES - banging around
dull thuds

CLATRE
Somebody’s in there

SAYID
Everybody in there’s dead

JACK
(under his breath)
Sawyer

SAWYER (0S)
Standing right behind you jackass

Jack looks back over his shoulder to indeed find SAWYER
Then turning back and with a deep breath Jack takes out
his itty-bitty PENLIGHT He moves off toward the opening of
the ruined fuselage

KATE
Jack
LOST Walkabout (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 71504 3

ON SAWYER - he throws a smirking glance to Kate as he whips
out his MEGA-WATT FLASHLIGHT Kate rolls her eyes then
follows Jack Sawyer follows her

Much schmuck-baiting as Jack nears the opening of the
wreckage and Locke folds into the group from the other side
The others in the camp hang back

REVERSE ANGLE - the four arrive at the opening and peer in
The banging and noises are louder now And we see something
in the foreground something NOT HUMAN moving inside

ON SAWYER - Waiting for Jack to make a move Then out of
patience

SAWYER
How ‘bout I shed a little light on--

Sawyer switches his lamp on and attempts to bring it up as a
SHARP GRUNT is heard from inside the fuselage and Jack
blocks his arm

PUSH IN to the darkness inside the cabin as we can just make
out

CLOSE-UP - SOMETHING’S HEAD turning to look at them
Moonlight glinting of its feral furious eyes as it snorts

CLOSE ON JACK - Staring back at it Without turning he
says to the others in a quiet but urgent whisper

JACK
Run

END OF TEASER

ACT ONE
EXT BEACH - NIGHT 44

Continuous The others barely have time to act on Jack’s
suggestion when Sawyer shines the flashlight inside

JACK
No

From inside SHRIEKS

THREE SMALLISH SQUEALING BEASTS come barreling out of the
fuselage fanning out in different directions Kate SCREAMS
as they run and the camp is thrown into chaos

Random shouts of “Look out” “What’s happening” “Get
away” etc as some flee some cower others bring up make-
shift weapons to defend themselves as the creatures charge
past them - including HURLEY who wields a diving FLIPPER

HURLEY
Aww crud now what

ON JIN brandishing a piece of driftwood as he commands SUN
JIN
(in Korean)
Stay down

She obeys staying crouched behind him

In the melee one of the fleeing CASTAWAYS run right into
CHARLIE knocking him down onto a jagged piece of wreckage

CHARLIE
Hey-- Oww

On the ground Charlie looks at the gash across his forearm
then glances up and reacts as A BEASTIE closes in on him

ON CHARLIE - Terror rising At the very last second he’s
YANKED to his feet flinching as a BLUR OF FUR flashes by
He glances back to discover it was

JACK who pulled him out of the animal’s path They both turn
just in time to see the RUSTLING OF BRUSH as the beasts
disappear into the jungle

ON SAYID shouting to the others

SAYID
It’s alright They’re gone

LOST Walkabout (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 71504 5

ON BOONE who’d been shielding a wigged out Shannon

BOONE
You okay

SHANNON
Yeah Way to go Ace

ON CHARLIE and JACK

CHARLIE
What the bloody hell was it

ON LOCKE nearby staring off stoically in the direction of
the departing animals

LOCKE
Boars
UPCUT TO CU ON
INT INFIRMARY TENT - A LITTLE LATER 45
JACK

We have to get rid of the bodies

WIDEN to see him conferring with Kate and Sayid as he dresses
Charlie’s wound

CHARLIE
What bury them There’s a whole
bunch in there--

SAYID

More than twenty Digging will be
difficult without shovels or--

JACK
Not bury We have to burn them

The other three react taken aback by that Jack notices --

JACK (CONT’D)

What
KATE JACK
They’re people -- I know they’re people
Kate
SAYID
Burning the remains They deserve

better than--
LOST Walkabout (BLUE) 72004 6

JACK

Than what Getting eaten by wild
animals ‘Cause that’s what’s
gonna happen Any bodies we bury
won’t stay buried for long Look
I know it seems harsh But that
fuselage in the sun it’s not
about what they deserve

(softening)
They’re gone And we’re not

Sayid looks at the ground shaking his head

SAYID
What you say may be true
(looks back up to Jack)
But it’s not right For us to
decide how these people are laid to
rest with no regard to their own
wishes -- their religions-

JACK
We don’t have time to sort out
everybody’s God

CHARLIE
Really Last I heard were
positively made of time

KATE CHARLIE
Charlie -- What I’m just saying

JACK

Hey I’m not happy about it either
But the plane crashed a thousand
miles off-course They’re looking
for us in the wrong place If
they’re even still looking

(then )
It’s been four days Nobodys
coming

The remainder of this registers on Sayid’s face

JACK (CONTD)
In the morning we need everybody
to start collecting wood Dried
brush We’re going in turn that
fuselage into a furnace

KATE
Crematorium you mean
LOST Walkabout (BLUE) 72004 6A

Jack looks at her And nods Starts to exit STOPS --
LOST Walkabout (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 71504 7

JACK
We’1l wait until the sun goes down
tomorrow night to set the fire

Kate nods as Jack goes As the others start to disperse
Charlie looks at Kate

CHARLIE
If he’s so eager to get this done
why’re we waiting ‘til

KATE
He’s hoping somebody’11 see it

She crosses off as Charlie takes that in

46 EXT HORIZON - DAWN - ESTABLISHING (STOCK) - DAY 5 46
The sun peeks out over the empty ocean Another day

47 EXT BEACH - DUNE - MORNING 47
ON A PILE of METAL PIECES STRIPPINGS WIRES and AIRPHONES
WITH CORDS Nearby lies the TRANSCEIVER from the cockpit
As a HAND reaches in and picks up a wire TILT UP to find

SAYID carefully wrapping the wire around a cylindrical piece
of piping attached to a curved piece of metal

KATE (0S)
Guess I’m not the only one who
didn’t sleep last night

He glances up at her then goes back to work

SAYID
There are better uses for my time
than collecting firewood

KATE
(gets his meaning)
You don’t agree with Jack

Sayid doesn’t answer her just goes about his business

KATE (CONT’D)
Whatre you making

SAYID
Too soon to talk about Not sure
if it’1ll even work

LOST Walkabout (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 71504

KATE
You’re trying to pick up the
signal aren’t you The one we
heard on the transceiver

Bingo Reluctantly Sayid nods

SAYID
If the French woman’s transmissions
have truly been playing on a loop
for sixteen years then there must
be a power source on this island
A significant one

KATE
You can find it

SAYID

Hypothetically yes

(beat)
I’m making an antenna of sorts
With a few of these mounted at
different points on the island I
may be able to use the transceiver
to triangulate the signal Find
out where it’s coming from

KATE
What can I do to help

SAYID
This is only a prototype Testing
it now may be premature

KATE
Then it’s a good thing I test well

Sayid eyes her for a moment Smiles A moment Then
SAYID
Appears you’re as anxious to get
off this island as I am

Boy don’t we know it Off Kate

EXT BEACH —- MEANWHILE

ON MICHAEL collecting wood near the edge of the jungle
Walt sits nearby petting Vincent who’s tied to a tree

suddenly catches sight of

He

HIS POV - LOCKE sitting in the sand unlocking a SUITCASE

and lifting the lid toward camera masking what’s inside

OF
LOST Walkabout (BLUE) 72004 9

ON WALT he gets up and starts to walk off Michael sees him
out of the corner of his eyes

MICHAEL
Where you going man

WALT
(busted)
Nowhere

MICHAEL looks over at LOCKE now rummaging through the
suitcase

WALT (CONTD)
I just thought I wanted to go
see what Mr Locke’s doing

MICHAEL
How ‘bout you help your dad with
the wood okay
(beat)
I’m sure Mr Locke doesn’t want a
kid hanging around him all day

anyway

Walt is obviously not keen on that option but he grudgingly
begins to pick up sticks --

WALT
At least he talks to me
That STINGS -- but it’s kinda true too
MICHAEL

Okay lLet’s talk then What you
wanna talk about

WALT
Forget it

As Walt sulks Michael casts another wary eye at Locke
before picking up a final piece of wood and crossing back to
the fuselage where we find

JACK a bandana around his neck supervising as various
others bring over wood and brush He takes Michael’s
delivery and passes it along to a chain of two other MEN
inside the cabin also wearing something across their faces
He casts a wary eye over at
LOST Walkabout (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 71504 10

HIS POV - A SMALL GATHERING of four or five CASTAWAYS
talking occasionally peering over Among them is Claire
who looks at Jack then peels away and crosses to him

CLAIRE
Excuse me Doctor

JACK
Jack Claire right
(re her belly)
How’s the

CLATRE
Good He’s good
(beat)
I think maybe you should see this

She hands Jack some folded partially SINGED papers As he
unfolds them

CLAIRE (CONT’D)
Somebody found it
(pointing to the fuselage)
In there They’re collecting
belongings

JACK’S POV - The pages contain hand written notes accompanied
by COLOR PHOTOS OF A HAPPY YOUNG COUPLE lovely bridal gown
a luxurious beach resort floral arrangements etc

CLAIRE (CONT’D)

They’re weeding plans

(pointing reading)
“Steve and Kristen’s” They were
on the plane Sitting a couple of
rows behind me I remember
‘cause

(a little overcome)
They looked so happy

Jack quickly returns the pages to her awkward under the
weight of her raw emotion --

JACK
I-- I don’t understand Claire
what am I supposed to do with--

CLATRE
I thought Well some of us were
wondering if maybe we should do
some kind of thing Like a
memorial service or something You
could lead it

OF

LOST Walkabout (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 71504 11

JACK
Uh no I don’t think

CLATRE
It’s just a few words Or maybe we
could just read off names From
the passports or driver’s licenses-—-

Jack’s had ENOUGH --

JACK
Look -- It’s not my thing

Claire instantly backs off Clear to her (and us) she’s
pushing a button that best ain’t pushed --

CLATRE
Oh Okay Then maybe I could
do it

JACK

Yeah Sounds fine Whatever
everybody wants

And with that Jack walks off As Claire watches him go
EXT BEACH - EDGE OF THE JUNGLE - MEANWHILE 49
ON BOONE collecting wood He looks up as

JIN crosses by his arms also laden with wood They notice
each other After a moment Boone offers

BOONE
Hi

Jin returns the greeting with a friendly nod and moves off
Boone crosses to a piece of driftwood high on the beach then
suddenly sees

ROSE sitting far down the beach near the surf by herself

REVERSE - CLOSE ON ROSE just sitting staring out at the
sea gently caressing the gold band she wears on a string
around her neck We can make out BOONE in the deep
background

EXT BEACH - MOMENTS LATER 50
ON SHANNON doing a crossword puzzle in the back of an

airline magazine as others continue to toil around her We
see BOONE dump off his wood by the fuselage and cross to her
Walkabout (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 71504 12

BOONE
That woman’s still sitting out
there
SHANNON
(barely listening)
Uh huh
BOONE
Her husband was on the plane In
the back
SHANNON
Great
BOONE

Are you even listening to me

SHANNON
What’s a four-letter word for “I
don’t care”

BOONE
She hasn’t moved from that spot
since yesterday Shannon
(beat)
Somebody should go talk to her

SHANNON
I nominate you
(weary sigh)
Taking care of the whole freakin’
world one person at a time

BOONE SHANNON

Not the whole world Just my

sister-- -- Who was doing just fine
until you came along

BOONE
Yeah You had it all together
That’s why I had to fly seven
thousand miles to rescue your ass
(then )
Face it Shannon You’d be lost
without me

SHANNON
Correction I am lost with you

LOST Walkabout (PINK) 72204 13

BOONE
Yeah well at least you know you
won’t starve with me to take care
of you

SHANNON BOONE
I’m not gonna starve
-- Yeah What’re you gonna
eat

SHANNON
(shrugs)
Ocean’s full of fish

BOONE
Hate to break it to you but the
ocean’s not gonna take your gold
card

And now Shannon finally puts down her magazine It’s ON --

SHANNON
You don’t think I can catch a fish

Boone’s look at her says it all Nope Before she can
respond their attention’s drawn to

ANGLE ON SAWYER and HURLEY yelling on top of one another
Hurley keeps reaching for the backpack in Sawyer’s hands
Sawyer shoves him away As they quarrel ten or fifteen
castaways converge on them

HURLEY SAWYER
-- hand ‘em over -- There’s -- How ‘bout ‘no’ --
other people here or don’t Well maybe if one of us
you give a crap -- didn’t eat more than his fair
That’s bull and you know it -- share wouldn’t be a shortage
Dude what’s your Problem -- Hey I’m peachy pork-pie
Not happy unless you’re Youre the one--

screwing over--
Boone enters the fray trying to calm the situation

BOONE
Okay guys knock it off C’mon --

SAWYER
Stay outta this Metro--

JACK (0S)
What’s going on
LOST Walkabout (BLUE) 72004 14

Sawyer Hurley and Boone look over to see JACK KATE and
SAYID pushing past some of the onlookers

HURLEY
(indicating Sawyer)
Jethro here’s hoarding the last
bags of peanuts

SAWYER
It’s my own stash
(nodding to fuselage)
Found ‘em in there

JACK
(to Hurley)
What about the rest of the food

HURLEY
(to Hurley)
There is no rest of the food dude
It’s gone We kinda ate it all

The castaways start to murmur “No food” And PANIC begins
to seep in People are really starting to get scared The
KNOWERS doing their best to maintain order --

JACK SAYID
Okay everybody calm down
-- We can find food There
are plenty of things on this
island to sustain us

ON SAWYER who casually leans against a row of detached
airplane seats

SAWYER
Oh yeah And exactly how are we
gonna get this sustenance

THWACK A good-sized knife suddenly imbeds itself in the
empty seat next to Sawyer He flinches back startled

ON JACK KATE and the others as they turn toward the
direction from which the knife had come to see

LOCKE

LOCKE
We hunt

Stop Let it sink in The pure AUTHORITY of this man
After a moment Kate steps toward him
LOST Walkabout (BLUE) 72004 14a

KATE
How’d you get that knife on the
plane
LOST Walkabout (BLUE) 72004 15

Locke eyes her a moment then shrugs

LOCKE
I checked it

Jack PULLS the knife out of the seat For a second we think
he might keep it but instead he offers it to Locke hilt

out Sizing up this guy for the first time --

JACK
Either you’ve got good aim
(looks to Sawyer)
Or bad aim Mr

MICHAEL
Locke His name’s Locke

JACK

Okay So what is it we’re hunting

Mr Locke
SLOW PUSH IN ON LOCKE as he speaks

LOCKE

We know there are wild boar on the
island Razorbacks by the look of
them The ones who came into camp
last night were piglets A
hundred hundred and fifty pounds
each That means there’s a mother
nearby A two-hundred and fifty
pound rat with scimitar-like tusks

and a surly disposition who’d love

nothing more than to eviscerate
anything that comes near her

ON JACK eyeing Locke as he continues

LOCKE (CONTD)

-- Boars’ usual mode of attack are
to circle around their prey charge

from behind So I figure it’1ll
take at least three of us to flank
one of the piglets distract it
just long enough for me to pin
it and slit its throat

Everyone stares at him stunned for a moment
turns to Jack --

SAWYER
And you gave him his knife back

Then Sawyer

LOST Walkabout (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 71504 16

JACK
If you’ve got a better idea

SAWYER
Better than three of y’all
wandering into the magic forest to
bag us a hunk ‘o ham armed with one
1’il bitty knife Hell no That’s
the best idea I ever heard

With the barest of smirks Locke takes a step toward his
black bag lying nearby and deftly KICKS open the lid

REVEAL strapped to the lid HALF A DOZEN LARGE HUNTING
KNIVES of various shapes and sizes along with other hunting
accountrements fishing line snake-bite kit etc

The others REACT Fuck

RANDY (0S)
Locke

Locke looks up from his call and we reveal

RANDY an office supervisor standing at the entrance to
Locke’s cubicle

That’s right Locke’s a mid-level management cubicle jockey

RANDY (CONT’D)

ACT TWO
EXT BEACH —- MID-DAY 52

CLOSE ON A KNIFE glinting in the sunlight Widen to see
Kate holding it looking it over before she slides it into
her belt and continues gearing up she hears

JACK (0S)
So you’re hunting boars now huh

She turns and sees Jack Hint of a smile This will always
be their dynamic -- concern baked under the fluffy crust of a
CHEMISTRY neither can deny As they WALK AND TALK --

KATE
Who says this is my first time boar-
hunting

JACK
Uh huh Tell me something -- How

come anytime there’s a hike into
the Heart of Darkness you sign up
You know what’s in there

KATE
Actually I don’t

And we can see that Kate is kinda scared VULNERABLE even

KATE (CONTD)
But at least I’ve got some
experience right

Jack smiles She can handle herself So he turns his
attention across the beach towards --

LOCKE filling his VEST with stuff from his suitcase

JACK
What’s your feel on our new friend

KATE
Seems to know what he’s doing

JACK
Call me paranoid but anyone who
packs a suitcase full of knives

KATE

If I didn’t know better I’d say
you were worried about me Jack

JACK
If I didn’t know better I’d say
you’ve got a problem staying in one
place very long Kate
(beat)
So you wanna tell me why you’re

really going

Kate stops She’s busted Eager to break this awkward

moment Kate makes sure they’re far enough away from the

others -- Opens up her pack revealing SAYID’S ANTENNA

KATE
Sayid gave me this so he can
triangulate the distress signal we

heard -- Find the source
JACK
(realizing)

This isn’t about boars

She smiles as she refastens her bag and hoists it does her
best to cover her nervousness with bravado --

KATE
What can I say I’m a vegetarian

She moves off Jack watching her go
EXT ANOTHER PART OF THE BEACH - MEANWHILE 53
WALT’s pleading with Michael who shoves things into a pack

WALT

Because I said so --

At that moment Michael notices SUN crossing by holding
plants she’s apparently dug up He attempts to communicate
with her pantomimicaly as he introduces himself --

off into the jungle

He gives her a cursory glance then tosses the dirt stands

LOCKE

Ground here’s been rooted up
That’s how boars get the majority
of their food Digging
Afterwards they generally wallow
in the dirt rub up against trees --

(pointing out tree scars)
--Scoring them with their tusks

MICHAEL
O-kay So what’s all that mean

LOCKE
Means we’re close

He starts to move off as Kate falls into step with him
KATE

Mr Locke how is it you--
(smiles then)

Sorry You have a first name
LOCKE

It’s John
KATE

John Locke Like the philosopher
Locke eyes her appreciatively That grin --

LOCKE
Like the philosopher

KATE
(searching her memory)
“Good and evil reward and
punishment are the only motives to
a rational creature”

She sees Locke and Michael just looking at her suddenly
becomes self-conscious

KATE (CONT’D)
Minored in college

MICHAEL
Great And I got an art degree
(looking around ironic)
Who says higher education doesn’t
prepare you for the real world

KATE
And where’d you learn all this

Locke continues to look at her before answering

LOCKE
Well let’s just say I’ve had time
to minor in a few things myself

LOCKE continues on moving past frame as we stay with Kate
and Michael They follow several steps behind

MICHAEL

ON ROSE still sitting stoically staring out as an airline
blanket is suddenly draped over her shoulders She doesn’t
respond or look up as Jack sits down next to her He holds
out a half empty bottle of water

JACK
Hi Rose right Remember me
Seat 23A

Getting no response from her he adds wryly

JACK (CONTD)
I’m the guy that told you not to
worry about the turbulence

Rose doesn’t even look at him

JACK (CONTD)
Everybody’s getting kinda worried
about you If you want to be
alone that’s fine but you need to
take care of yourself You really
should drink

(no response he sighs)
Okay We don’t have to talk
Let’s just sit For a while

And they do In silence

LOST Walkabout (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 71504 25

KATE
Your son -- How’s he handling all
this
MICHAEL
Hell of a lot better than I am
KATE
You must be proud He’s a brave
kid
MICHAEL

Yeah Can’t take credit for that --
I wasn’t part of his life ‘til his

What were you doing in Australia

ON KATE Uh oh Thankfully --

LOCKE (0S)
Shhhhh

They halt and look to find themselves in a FIELD OF TALL
GRASS Kate and Michael FREEZE as Locke signals -- “It’s
right there” And sure enough we see --

FLASHES of dark fur as what must be a BOAR moves through the
tall grass GRUNTS SNORTS And shit -- it’s CLOSE

LOCKE turns toward Michael and Kate and tries to signal them
silently to flank the boar

KATE starts to move up close to Locke but MICHAEL eager to
challenge Locke’s authority is resistant to comply

MICHAEL
(whispering)
Quit giving us the steal sign
Damn pig doesn’t even know we’re--

A LOUD SNORT as --

LOST Walkabout (BLUE) 72004 26

SOMETHING EXPLODES FROM THE TALL GRASS IT’S BIG FLASH OF
FUR AND TUSK AS IT CHARGES

Locke grabs onto Kate pulling her out of the way of the
charging BOAR The animal sideswipes LOCKE hard sending him

spinning to the ground And continues to charge at
MICHAEL -- IT HITS HIM HARD IN THE LEG AND HE GRUNTS IN PAIN
as he goes down --

Kate picks herself up a few feet away -- the GRUNTING AND
SNORTING still all around them -- and makes her way to help
Michael

CLOSE ON LOCKE down on the ground dazed -- we’re in his
head space again (dream-like SLO-MO) much like we saw him
in the teaser He props himself up and sees

HIS POV - Kate reaches Michael obviously HURT As we
continue to hear the angry SNARLS of the boar

BACK TO LOCKE as he turns his attention to

HIS FEET Just like in the teaser He hasn’t lost a shoe

headfirst into the water He flails a moment before
awkwardly righting himself in the shallow inlet

Suddenly in the midst of their bickering they pause
feeling a presence and look back at the beach to see

embarrassed look After this awkward beat --

Jin crosses out onto the reef squats and stares down into

KATE

JACK
(distracted)
Yeah
LOST Walkabout (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 71504 48

KATE
I don’t think they’re ready to know
what we --

She pauses suddenly realizing Jack is looking past her at
something

HIS POV - The OLDER MAN in the white shoes mostly obscured
by the foliage Kate sees Jack’s expression

KATE (CONTD)
What

But Jack is already moving past her toward
The OLDER MAN who moves off deeper into the jungle

Jack’s rushing to the edge of the jungle Kate right behind
him

KATE (CONTD)
Jack --

He’s about to dive in when

A LARGE FORM emerges from the brush Jack and Kate come to a
sudden halt and look upon

LOCKE his brow and arms slightly bloodied his arms slung
over a long stick across his shoulders not unlike a
scarecrow

JACK
Locke --

Locke suddenly heaves the stick off of him and we see a DEAD
BOAR hog-tied to it The carcass hits the ground before
them

CLOSE ON LOCKE - His face flush with the kill his chest
heaving

CUT TO BLACK

END OF ACT FOUR

LOST Walkabout (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 71504 49

ACT FIVE
EXT BEACH - BY THE FUSELAGE - NIGHT 73

CRANE SHOT - We see smoke and fiery embers rising up against
the night sky then TILT DOWN onto

THE BURNING FUSELAGE and the CROWD of SURVIVORS standing
before it some bowing their heads in prayer others quietly
crying -- all the while hearing Claire’s voice

CLATRE

Judith Martha Walker Denton
Texas Guess she was gonna catch
a connecting flight

(studying the license)
Uh well she wore corrective
lenses And she was an organ
donor

CUT IN ON CLAIRE sniffling her way through these impromptu
eulogies - (occasionally popping in on others as they
listen) HURLEY stands next to her holding various IDs
documents and other items BOONE is also near holding up a
TORCH giving her the light to read NOTE We may also see
an iPod propped up on some luggage along with two external
speakers as we hear an appropriate SONG playing

CLAIRE (CONTD)
Or wouldve been

She hands off the license to Hurley who hands her the
wedding plans she found earlier She reacts

CLAIRE (CONT’D)

Oh yeah Steve and Kristen I
don’t know their last names but
They were in love And they were
going to be married--

(her voice breaks)
At least At least wherever they
are now they have each other
They’re not alone

ARC around a tree as CLAIRE’S faltering voice continues in
the background to find

CHARLIE taking a hit from his bag of dope He closes his
eyes letting the numbness wash over him and shoves the bag
back into his pocket (There ain’t much left)

WE GO WITH HIM as he steps out from his hiding place and
rejoins the crowd winding up next to KATE near the back

t

LOST Walkabout (PINK) 72204 50

PANNING ACROSS the gathered we see LOCKE next to WALT and
MICHAEL then SAYID SHANNON SAWYER SUN and JIN and
finally ROSE her eyes closed appearing almost serene

CLAIRE (CONT’D)
-Manuel Raphael Ortiz Los
Angeles He turned thirty-two
wow just last week And well
looks like Diego didn’t travel much
-- At least as far as we can tell
from his passport

(off piece of paper)

- But oh he must’ve had
children A video store receipt
in his wallet lists overdue
charges Willy Wonka and The
Little Princess

ON KATE standing by CHARLIE She scans the assembled

KATE
(whispering to Charlie)
Have you seen Jack

Charlie looks around but can only shrug Off Kate’s
concerned look as we hear Claire

CLAIRE (0S)
So I guess
(becoming emotional)
I expect they’re missing their
daddy right now

EXT BEACH - FAR END - MEANWHILE 74

We see the fiery fuselage and congregated survivors way off
in the distance then BOOM DOWN to find

JACK sitting alone staring out over the ocean far down the
beach where Rose had sat Lost in troubled thoughts

EXT BEACH - BY THE FUSELAGE - NIGHT 75
As we hear Claire reading on we find

MICHAEL - He glances over at Locke who doesn’t look back
After a beat they speak in whispers

MICHAEL
Nice work

LOCKE
What

LOST Walkabout (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 71504 51

MICHAEL
The boar Nice work Yknow
Killing it
(beat)
Just thought I should say
something

Locke looks at him a moment then nods accepting Michael’s
compliment and returns to looking at the funeral pyre
Another beat then

MICHAEL (CONT’D)
So that Thing The monster

whatever She said it was heading
right toward you

Locke now turns and looks directly into Michael’s eyes
MICHAEL (CONT’D)
Did you see it I mean did you
get any kind of look at it

A moment passes before Locke shakes his head

LOCKE
No

Michael stares back at Locke for a beat Then nods and turns
back to the service As does Locke

PUSH IN ON Locke’s face - flames flickering in his eyes
INT MELBOURNE WALKABOUT TOURS - MORNING - FLASHBACK 76

CLOSE ON an Aussie TRAVEL AGENT sitting at his desk inside
the storefront operation

TRAVEL AGENT
-- The Walkabouts we arrange aren’t
just some stroll through the

park It’s trekking over vast
stretches of desert -- rafting
treacherous waters -- climbing --

CLOSE ON LOCKE sitting across from him dressed in a khaki
vest cap and dark sunglasses A small bitter smile masking
his contempt

LOCKE
You’ve got no idea who you’re
talking to Believe me I’m well
aware of what’s involved

(MORE)

LOST Walkabout (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 71504 52

LOCKE (CONTD)
Probably know more than you on the
subject--

TRAVEL AGENT
(cutting him off)
In any case it’s a trying ordeal
for someone in peak physical
condition let alone --

LOCKE
Look -- I booked this tour a month
ago You’ve already got my money
Now I demand a place on that bus--

TRAVEL AGENT LOCKE
You misrepresented yourself
-- I never lied

TRAVEL AGENT
By omission Mr Locke You
neglected to tell us about your
condition --

LOCKE
(snapping)
My condition -- is not an issue
I’ve lived with it for four years
and it’s never kept me--

TRAVEL AGENT
Yes well unfortunately it’s an
issue to our insurance company

Seeing this going nowhere the Travel Agent stands and
crosses past Locke who doesn’t get up

TRAVEL AGENT (CONT’D)
I’m sorry I can’t keep the bus
waiting any longer It isn’t fair
to the other people--

LOCKE
Don’t talk to me about fair --

TRAVEL AGENT
-- We can put you on a plane back
to Sydney on our dime It’s the
best we can do--

We see through a large window a tour bus waiting to leave
its doors open the guide on the steps looking at his watch

LOST Walkabout (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 71504 53

LOCKE
I don’t want to go back to Sydney
I’ve spent years preparing for
this -- You put me on that bus
right now I can do this

TRAVEL AGENT
(at the doorway )
No You can’t

He exits to confer with the guide as Locke yells after him

LOCKE
Don’t you walk away from me

He suddenly swivels around

LOCKE (CONTD)

You don’t know who you’re dealing
with -- Don’t ever tell me what I
can’t do Ever

As he rolls himself toward the window PULL OUT to REVEAL
LOCKE IS IN A WHEELCHAIR And has been throughout the entire

flashbacks Shot to hide it but dropping subtle clues The
unscuffed shoes the waist-high shelving the EMS unit etc

THE BUS doors close and it pulls away The Travel Agent
looks back at Locke shakes his head and walks away Just
doesn’t want to deal with the guy

LOCKE (CONT’D)

This is destiny This is my
destiny I’m supposed to do this
dammit

PULL UP HIGH and WIDE Locke looking small and impotent

LOCKE (CONTD)
DON’T TELL ME WHAT I CAN’T--

FLASH CUT TO
EXT BEACH - DAY 77
LOCKES TOES - Wiggling beneath their sock
ANGLE ON LOCKE staring dumbly at them then as before he

retrieves his pristine shoe (understanding its clean because
HE’S NEVER WALKED ON IT) -- and puts it on

LOST Walkabout (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 71504 54

Once he does he looks up to the sky almost serenely As
if an understanding’s been reached

Locke braces himself on a large nearby piece of wreckage
and carefully pulls himself up to his feet He takes stock
of his legs gently rubbing them -- They appear steady and
he wills them to take one two three tentative
steps Then a couple more confident ones

CLOSE ON LOCKE - Turning back to the scene of carnage -- His

face flush with this “miracle” as he puts his hand on his
hips and watches --

CUT IN TO COVERAGE FROM THE PILOT - Shannon screaming Jin
calling out Michael looking for Walt etc and we HEAR
Jack’s voice yelling over the whine of the jet engine

JACK (0S)
-- get over here -- gimme a hand --

ON LOCKE glancing over at
JACK who turns and sees him
JACK (CONTD)

You C’mon Come over here

Gimme a hand --
TIGHT CLOSE-UP ON LOCKE looking over at Jack

FLASH CUT TO

EXT BEACH - NIGHT 78

ON LOCKE - His eyes drift over to something past the crowd

HIS POV - THE WHEELCHAIR a short distance from the burning
fuselage resting idle and empty

CLOSE ON LOCKE as a small smile curls the corner of his
lips
