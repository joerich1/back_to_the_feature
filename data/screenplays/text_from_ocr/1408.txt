A dull highway A crappy sedan roars by

INT CRAPPY CAR - DAY

At the wheel driving this piece of shit is MIKE ENSLIN 35

a grizzled weary soul He stares glassily at the road a
cigarette behind his ear a styrofoam cup of Exxon coffee at

his mouth

A sign drifts by Woodfin Rte 251 N - Asheville Interstate
240-E Hwy 40 Next Right Thru Traffic Merge

Heh Mike frowns

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - DUSK

RAIN pours down on an unpaved country intersection

Mike stands outside his car soaked checking a wet map Hes

confused and annoyed There are no road markings at all He
checks his watch

r EXT COUNTRY INN - NIGHT
A quaint rural inn dark of night The ambiance is
picturesque but off-putting Porch lanterns glow Shadows
are deep An ancient elm tree frames the banging weathered
sign The Camden Inn
Then finally -- headlights Mikes car pulls up in the mud
INT INN - NIGHT

Mike trudges into the homey worn lobby

MIKE
Hi Mike Enslin checking in --

The gregarious INNKEEPERS jump up excited Theyre country
folk beaming

MR INNKEEPER
Oh Mr Enslin We were so worried
you werent gonna show

MRS INNKEEPER
Its such an honor to have you here

MIKE
(disinterested)
Yeah Great Uh if I could just
get my key --

They ignore his exhaustion

MR INNKEEPER
You probably want to hear all about
our haunted history Well that rear
staircase is where the maid reputedly
hung herself in 1870

MRS INNKEEPER
Theres a picture -

MIKE
Can we do this in the morning

MRS INNKEEPER
(rummaging through drawers)
Wait Its printed in our brochure

INSERT - BROCHURE

She thrusts out a brochure that says HAUNTED Theres
PHOTO of the lobby and a faint white shape in a window

MRS INNKEEPER
Do you SEE her

MIKE
Uh --

MRS INNKEEPER
A guest took that photo in 1986 You
can sort of see Sylvias ethereal
apparation” reflected in the window

Mike stares unimpressed

MR INNKEEPER
At least Sylvia is what we call her

MIKE
Terrifying
pause)
Im ready to hit the sack In your
letter you mentioned the scariest
rooms were in the old attic

MRS INNKEEPER
Thats right The third floor is the
former servants quarters People
say all Sylvias children died up
there of tuberculosis

He speaks flatly into a pocket MINI-RECORDER

The event It’s depressing -- the sad reality of
pooksignings The back of the store has 30 or 40 folding
chairs but theres only FIVE SPECTATORS Mike sits

alongside a pile of his paperbacks discoursing

MIKE
Sure these places have colorful
histories Thats the hook The
wedding night murder The caretaker
who leaped to his death The runaway
horse that trampled the old lady
The war widow who went crazy and
threw the baby down the well

The people go wide-eyed Mike lets this hang then deflates
it

MIKE
But theres never any documentation
If you do one iota of research the
tragic event never happened Its
just a marketing hook invented by
desperate hotels when the interstate
gets built too far away

The crowd doesnt get it One EMPHATIC MAN raises his hand

» EMPHATIC MAN
Have you ever seen a poltergeist

MIKE

(he reacts)
See Thats exactly what Im talking
about You didnt hear one word I
just said I can type myself sick
debunking these places shooting
arrows in the legends and it only
makes people want to stay there more

LADY
she raises her hand)
Well my family’s planning a trip
this summer Would you say theres a
higher concentration of ghosts in New
England or in the South

EXT FLORIDA BEACH DAWN

eking over the horizon The pink sky is lovely

The sun is pes
breaking over a rocky inlet

Mike drives into a beach parking lot He glances over --
spotting a cluster of Parked cars Across the sand a GROUP
of dedicated SURFERS in wetsuits ride the early morning waves

Mike stares -- then keeps driving A surfboard sticks out of
his car He goes to the far end of the parking lot off by
himself then pulls over

EXT OCEAN - LATER

Mike rides a wave Its exquisite For him this experience
isnt about adrenaline but tranquility The weariness that
usually hangs over him is gone Hes alone and perfectly
serene Happy

Mike enjoys the spray in his face Until -- he hears a
strange BUZZING He looks around then UP

ABOVE

A small AIRPLANE flies over towing a BANNER
Mike squints trying to read it

The sky is teo bright The banner is silhouetted
Mike focuses harder distracted when --
BAM

A monstrous WAVE suddenly POUNDS him

Crash Mike gets slammed underwater
UNDERNEATH

Mike gets pulled down

He screams out but only bubbles emerge

The water BATTERS him Everything swirls He spins losing
track of which way is up

Mike struggles desperate trying to reach for sky
getting sucked deeper toward th he darkness

Mike sits in a corner booth alone His breakfast sits
abandoned runny egg yolks congealed He sips his eighth cup

The table is spread with months o a Dozens of

situation The Dolphin may not have

Carlyle but we run 90 occupancy

(emphatic)
This isn’t about my concern for the
hotel OR about my concern for you
Frankly - selfishly -- I dont want
you to enter 1408 because I don’t
want to havé to clean up the mess

Olin lets this chilling thought hang
Mikes eyes widen

OLIN
Hotels are all about presentation and
creature comforts though behind
the scenes we witness quite the bit
of nastiness

(heavy)
But my training is as a manager not
and a coroner Under my watch there have
been four deaths Four ter the

last one I said enough I forbade
any guests from ever entering again

MIKE
And that last suicide was Randolph
Hyde 1996 An orthodontist who
slit his wrists and cut off his
genitals

heavier Mike takes a few steps then turns

AT THE END

in stands framed in the elevator an ordinary man in a plain
suit Hands clasped face withdrawn he sighs
OLIN
Good luck
Olin pulls out the bottle of Cognac and tosses it Startied
Mike catches it He starts to respond -- but ers SHOT

is now alone He hoists his duffel then walks slowly down
the hushed hallway Past 1401 1402

Mike examines Olins file

INSERT -— FILE

A grisly PHOTOGRAPH marked KEVIN OMALLEY He lies dead in

the bathtub His eyes are wide his throat gashed open a
sewing needle protruding from raw flesh

MIKE
grimaces He walks past 1404 past a moldering room service
tray On the plate are remains of a beef burger soaked in red

ketchup A fly buzzes

INSERT - FILE

Back to the photos Mike flips to a nasty half-covered BODY
in bed The sheets are soaked

IN THE HALL

Mike is getting rattled He makes a turn 1406 goes by
1407 wood-paneled doors and elegant wallpaper

Mike finds a scratched NOTE on hotel stationery
INSERT - FILE

Frantic writing “My brother was eaten by wolves on the
Connecticut Turnpike”
IN THE HALL

Mike stops considering this oddity

He looks up -- and realizes hes in front of 1401

Mike looks around confused Somehow hes back at the
elevator

What the fuck

Then he packs up the file and
WIDE

Mike watches the numbers go by Get to that room 2 3 4
5 6 7 He swings around a corner And there unassuming
and anonymous is 1408

Mike pulls out his brass KEY He starts to insert it -- when
he’s startled by WHIMPERING

AT THE NEXT ROOM

is a YOUNG MOTHER turned away from us She holds a sobbing
BABY She fumbles with her mag card then disappears inside

BACK ON MIKE AT THE DOOR
Okay He takes a breath then inserts the key in the lock
MICRO-CLOSEUP INSIDE THE LOCK

The vintage mechanism looks like a GIGANTIC DARK CHAMBER
filled with crazy angles of cold steel

The key enters like a medieval battering ram It slowly
turns The tumblers RUMBLE with echoing CLINKS and CRICKS
The sound rises ominously LOUD

BACK TO MIKE - NORMAL PERSPECTIVE
And the sound becomes a teeny CLICK

The door unlocks
Inside the next room the Young Mothers VOICE leaks out

YOUNG MOTHER (0S)
(singing softly)
Mama loves her baby baby baby”

The knot in Mikes stomach grows
He grips the doorknob He lifts up his recorder

MIKE
Its 752 pm and Im about to

E Then he slowly turns the knob --
The tension builds --

The wooden door opens --

And
INT SAME TIME
Its - just a hotel room

A two-room suite pleasant and banal Pastel sitting area
beige carpet forgettable furniture

Mike sees this and gasps relieved He starts LAUGHING

MIKE
Thats it
(he LAUGHS harder)
Thats friggin IT

Astonished he enters and throws his stuff down He defiantly
SLAMS the door shut and SHOUTS

MIKE
All right Olini You win Round One
(annoyed with himself)
You had me goin Wheres the

spiderwebs the lightning the river
ef blood This is just a room

Mike gives himself a tour

Theres a couch A coffee table A desk with various items
A fax machine A glass ashtray An old-fashioned rotary
telephone A book of matches with a Norman Rockwellish
sketch of a smiling Doorman at the hotel

re three framed paintings In the carpet below

The wall THERMOSTAT says 80 Mike clicks the “down” arrow

INT BEDROOM

Theres a queen-size bed with fluffy pillows ATV A
nightstand Bible Mike picks it up then tosses it aside
INT BATHROOM

Mike nm the bathroom lights It’s bright and sparkling

so
ing glow of luxury

Theres a tub A bidet Baskets of soap

The toilet paper roll is folded in a fancy little triangle
Mike tears off a sheet and wipes his nose

INT LIVING ROOM

Mike opens an armoire and finds the MINI-BAR He peruses the
sodas booze and chips He glances at the price sheet
MIKE
Eight dollars for Corn-Nuts This is
an evil fucking room
cur TO

INT BEDROOM LATER

Mike lies on the made bed eating Corn-Nuts and swigging
Olins Cognac He narrates into his recorder from memory

MIKE
The living room has two chairs a
sofa a writing desk anda faux-
antique armoire The carpet is beige
and unremarkable except for a stain
beneath a thrift-store painting of a
sailing ship”

TIGHT - THE PAINTING
We FOCUS ON the painting as Mike describes it from memory
MIKE (0S)
The work is executed in the always
dull Currier and Ives fashion --
sailors on a white schooner

We MOVE TO the SECOND PAINTING -- an old lady in a rocking

chair
MIKE (0S)
The second painting is an old woman
a la Whistler’ i mother smiling down
as small children play at her feet
We MOVE TO the THIRD PAINTING -- a British hunting scene

MIKE (0S)
The third and final painfully-dull
ainting is the ever popular The
Hunt - horses hounds and
constipated British lords

Mike gets up and walks to the window He opens the drapes
OUTSIDE another building completely fills the view Below
are cars and a huge litup BANK CLOCK Mike opens the paned
window TRAFFIC NOISE rises in
MIKE
The panorama is a typical cramped
New York view of nothing A gray
building and honking traffic below
The clock outside clicks from 759 to 800 PM
Suddenly LOUD MUSIC
Mike jumps startled
BEHIND HIM
The clock RADIO has gone off The CARPENTERS sing
THE CARPENTERS (0S)

Mike laughs He turns it OFF flicking the alarm switch

MIKE

Mike turns -- then suddenly freezes

THE BED
is turned down The sheet is folded and there are little
mint chocolates on the pillows

MIKE
Holy shiiit

Mike blinks as if this will make the mints disappear

He strolls over and picks up a mint He peers

MIKE
Bravo Olin That is VERY unsettling

Mike opens the candy then EATS it He thinks his wheels
spinning Until -- he suddenly stops mid-chew

MIKE
That means someones in the room

Mike whirls
WIDE

Emboldened Mike RUNS to the CLOSET He slams open the door --
and - its empty

Hm Mike looks around Ah Suddenly he drops to his knees
and peers under the BED But theres nothing

Hm Mike thinks He bolts into the bathroom He grabs the
shower curtain takes a breath then YANKS it aside

And -- nobody Huh
Mike wracks his mind Tantalized

MIKE
Come out come out

Detective-like he starts RAPPING on the drywall

RAP RAP RAP

TIGHT - TOILET PAPER

the toilet paper roll has returned to its original state
again it has a folded triangle

MIKE
Whoa Bizarre
(beat)
A ghost that offers turndown service
Then he pulis out his recorder CLICK

MIKE

Okay lets Encyclopedia Brown this
I was facing the window

Then I saw the mints ran to the

closet which would leave time for

Houdini to get in the bathroom do

the paper trick -

(he stops)
No I wouldve seen him --
(beat)

No ‘Unless he started in the
bathroom so when I turned my back
he did the mints and escaped into
the living room

Mike barrels into the

INT LIVING ROOM

He lopes around -- searching searching Until he spots --
the AIR VENT up in the ceiling
Ahi Mike runs up -- and thinks he sees movement inside Or

does he

He stands on his tiptoes and SHOUTS up into it

) MIKE

Hellooo Hello asshole Youre
gonna have to try harder

(he smirks)
Nice and HOT up there

Mike wipes his brow He realizes hes sweating
Mike runs to the THERMOSTAT and checks it Its now 34

MIKE

How many died”

Mike thinks He unzips his duffel slides over his LAPTOP
and carefully removes a small EQUIPMENT CASE Inside is
assorted gear An EMF meter microphones a UV black light

ACROSS THE ROOM
Mike dims the room Then he turns on the UV light It HUMS
emitting a weird biue glow He holds the tube over the carpet

stain and it GLOWS vivid and brackish

A strange sealike sensation He staggers a bit nauseous
A SOUND of pounding waves The painted water seems real

Mike is losing his equilibrium

MIKE

Mike takes a step - then -- suddenly gets a look
He spins

The paintings are still straight

Mike relents He FLICKS the tube The mercury suddenly emits
a blue SPARK then rolls downward

The system CHURNS then the air-conditioning BLOWS on Mike
smiles relieved

MIKE

Mike turns to thank the man - and hes GONE

Mike finally reaches his room OQuivering sucking in all his

strength he LIFTS HIMSELF UP onto the ledge A shaky beat -
then he looks back inside

FAST ZOOM
across the room RIGHT UP TO THE MAP on the door

ZOOMING TIGHTER until the MAP FILLS THE FRAME And -- its
alive the black lines slithering around like worms The map
rearranges itself doors and walls moving about

MIKE
goes pale

Suddenly - the Portiy Lady steps out into the window She is
sobbing

PORTLY LADY
May Jesus forgive me
(beat she scowls
hatefully)
And FUCK YOU HENRY SMITH

She starts to jump - when she suddenly sees Mike A bizarre
discombobulation then she lashes out at him punching at him

like the movements we saw earlier

Freaked out she leaps

He tugs the grate - its fastened with four bolts Fine He
hurriedly pulls out his trusty LETTER OPENER and starts to use
it as a screwdriver

MIKE
Okay Here goes nothin’

Mike unscrews the first bolt It falls to the ground
An anxious pause - then he quickly unscrews the second bolt
The third

Wary Mike reaches and slowly pulls the grate off the ceiling
He drops it watching it hit the floor with a CLANG

Beat - then he slowly turns back to the now-open vent
Suddenly he LUNGES at the tiny black tube and GRABS it

MIKE

Mike steels himself then painfully lifts his body up into
INT AIR-CONDITIONING VENT - SAME TIME

Mike clangs onto the hard cold surface He pulls his legs up
Inside its black We cant see a foot ahead

Mike aims his penlight but its just a dull glow Shadows
and rat droppings

Mike takes a breath then squirms forward

Its murky and unsettling The air BLASTS Mike slithers
along unsure creeped-out Until his penlight reveals

A JUNCTION AHEAD
A T split Shafts go left and right

Mike stops -- not sure where to go He shines the tiny light
both ways but the beam disappears into dimness

Then - faint VOICES
Mikes eyes bulge
The VOICES are from the right

Mike gets excited Other people He scrambles down the vent

Not far he sees LIGHT Its coming from a GRATE in the floor
of the shaft
Mike hustles faster He reaches the grate -- then looks down

He might need a little help
CUT TO
INT RENTAL CAR - DRIVING - DAY
S Lily drives a white rental car Mike sits in the passenger

seat staring a large bandage across his temple

The boulevard is quite uninspiring Overgrown palm trees
graffitied Cuban markets faded pink motels

LILY
Remind me again Why do you live
here

MIKE

I can be anonymous
She laughs
EXT BEACH PARKING LOT DAY

dolphin jumps in the waves

P EXT MAILBOXES ETC - DAY
The same fluorescent craphole we saw before The scene plays
just like last time Mike enters and goes to his mailbox He
unlocks it removing a startling amount of MAIL
The MAILBOX GUY nods

A disinterested beat -- then Mike reacts offput

INT PALM COFFEE SHOP DAY

Mike sits in his corner booth alone Hes going through
months of OPENED MAIL The table is spread with brochures
from haunted hotels and inns a bill from Saint Josephs
Nursing Home the Weekly World News

Mike slashes an envelope with his letter opener removing a
childish GREETING CARD It has a cartoon monkey saying No
Monkeying Around Happy Birthday

) Mike reacts strangely The oddest sensation

He frowns -- then suddenly wades through all the hotel mail
Frantically digging through photos flyers searching
searching

INT MATLBOXES ETC - DAY
The door SLAMS open Mike barges back in a bit frenzied

MIKE

The Mailbox Guy stares

MATLBOX GUY

- Then his eyes drift up

Perturbed Mike scans the floor
there is an AIR VENT

up to the CEILING Up
Mike is bothered
EXT MATLBOXES ETC - SECONDS LATER

Mike runs out punching 411 into his CELI

Mike frantically scrolls through MICROFICHE pages blurring
by Suddenly he finds the ancient New York Herald-Tribune
front page He leans in -- but the headline has changed

Now it says FACTORY OWNER LEAPS OFF BRIDGE” Underneath is a
PHOTO of some cops at a riverbank

Mike gasps disturbed

MIKE
No way --

A moment of dislocation when he remembers something Mike
whips out his LEGAL PAD But -- now the pages are all EMPTY

A spooky pause when suddenly -- RING Its his CELLPHONE

LILY
Maybe I should drive you back to the

MIKE
No no -- Im not ill Its just
this powerful sense of deja vu The
feeling of something so immediate --
yet you know it didn’t happen

He stares entranced
MIKE
I cant believe I’m sitting here with
you
She slowly smiles
A WOMAN in a flowered dress passes by Mike glances - and
for a FLASH shes the Portly Lady from 1408

Huh

Mike turns -- and now she’s a CUBAN LADY

He wipes his eyes on edge Questioning himself He leans
to Lily his voice tremulous We MOVE IN on the couple

WIDE

Another WORKMAN turns revealing hes the ENGINEER from the
hotel He slams the floor unveiling BEIGE CARPET underneath

ON MIKE’S FACE
All color drains

His expression goes from fear to realization to madness

The room starts SPINNING

AROUND HIM the SOUND of CONSTRUCTION BUILDS Louder LOUDER
a CRUSH of activity

THE ROOM

spins faster Every revolution transforms us back to 1408
The WALLS all become wallpapered

A WORKMAN leers in a blur becoming Kevin OMalley
Mike staggers terrified

The room spins faster The Mailbox Store is vanishing
The CEILING tile crashes down revealing 1408s VENT
The FURNITURE appears around us

The WHIR builds to a high-pitched painful SHRIEK --
And THEN --

INT SAME TIME

The howl suddenly STOPS

And Mike is left collapsed onto the carpet of 1408 Curled
in a fetal position whimpering confused

He slowly lifts his head and a horrible guttural MOAN
passes from his lips

Hes back

THE ROOM IS JUST AS HE LEFT IT RAVAGED DRENCHED LIKE A
HURRICANE BLEW THROUGH

The unplugged clock keeps ticking down 455 454
Mike unsteadily rises He shouts plaintively

MIKE
No NO I was OUT --

VOICE OF THE ROOM
WRONG YOU NEVER LEFT

Mike jerks startled

The voice is behind him Unnerved Mike slowly turns And
back there is
Tentative shaky he crosses closer

waits Mike forces himself Sweating Heart

The door

pounding crazy

Valiantly hands trembling he reaches to the handle
Grimacing with dread he starts to turn it --

When - his courage lets out He lets go

The VOICE snickers
VOICE OF THE ROOM

MICHAEL YOUVE BEEN LOOKING FOR
SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN FOR A LIFE
AFTER DEATH WELL HERE I AM

THE DOOR HANDLE

starts turning by itself

Mike shudders

THE DOOR

slowly opens Through the crack we SEE a DEEP BLACK SPACE
of a place that exists somewhere other than 1408

MIKE
seizes up aghast
A DARK SHADOW falls over him

We DONT SEE what is revealed behind the door But Mike does
His FACE beholds a horror no sane person can endure

His eyes widen His mouth opens in a silent scream
VOICE OF THE ROOM
YOU SAID GOD DOESNT EXIST

Mike crumples in on himself finished Hes cowering beaten
He covers his head preparing for a fatal blow We MOVE
CLOSER CLOSER until his FACE IS IN TIGHT CLOSE-UP
Readying himself for an unimaginable fate

The tension of the moment builds to 4a climax The end
imminent And then —-

A melancholy MUSIC
KAREN CARPENTER S VOICE
(singing)

Huh Mike looks up
IN FRONT OF HIM
The door has DISAPPEARED
In its place is
GRACIE

Dressed in her dirty pink nightgown Shes pale skeletally
thin her hair falling out

She looks at Mike and smiles A smile that makes her face
look even more skuli-like

GRACIE

MIKE
(anguished)

He backs away Hurt she weakly reaches to touch him

GRACIE
I need help

MIKE
Youre not Graciel

GRACIE

Tears spring to Mikes eyes Fighting this he steps back
Mikes face caves Suddenly overpowered by feelings

RUSHES FORWARD and GRABS her tightly

MIKE
Oh Gracie Gracie Gracie

TIGHT - MIKE AND GRACIE

His eyes are shut clinging to her tiny body
electric thing he’s ever felt

She speaks barely a whisper

GRACIE
It wont let me stay

He looks up as she convulses violently Her face damp with

The most

sweat He touches her forehead -- its burning up

MIKE
No Honey no ones gonna take you

Her eyes brim with tears of pain

GRACIE
Do you love me Daddy

MIKE
You know I dol

GRACIE
