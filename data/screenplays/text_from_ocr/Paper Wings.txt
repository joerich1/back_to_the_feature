Paper Wings

“Paper wings all torn and bent
But you made me feel that they were heaven sent

Paper wings not real at all
But they took me high enough to really fall”

Gillian Welch “Paper Wings”
EXTREMELY CLOSE

What is it It could be a black hole at the center of our
universe It could be a marble in a kid’s pocket We’re too
close to tell What we do know is that it’s beautiful

WE’RE PULLING SLOWLY BACK and it is completely silent There
is a sense of peace here Of calm

PULL BACK A LITTLE MORE It’s an eye isn’t it Open wide
and staring The eye of a very large animal

Now we can see the enormous powerful head of a bull The
arch of the neck The muscles rippling in the withers

WE CONTINUE TO MOVE until slowly we come to realize that we
are watching a man riding a bull We’re in slow motion
There is no sound The young man riding the bull is BILLY
BODEEN By the calm look on his face you realize that this
ride for him is peaceful

We’re back far enough now to see Billy his right hand on
this furiously bucking bull his left circling for balance
But the look on his face is locked in focused He’s right
where he belongs

The bull’s hind legs slam silently back down to earth and
dust comes up in a beautiful billow obscuring Billy for a
moment as we keep pulling back

The bull completely airborne a body roll all four feet
kicking to the side

Billy anticipates the bull’s moves sliding to one side - to
the other - and now the BUZZER rings Eight seconds

Billy waits until the bull reverses again spinning away from
his riding hand (the hand roped to the bull) Then he
reaches down with his free hand jerks loose his riding hand
from his bull rope and flings himself off as the bull is
kicking so that the momentum of the kick will take him as far
away from the bull as possible He goes high into the air
backwards away from the bull’s horns

BILLY LANDS

We come crashing into real time His heart pumping His
breath coming heavy His eyes ablaze Now we can hear the
ROAR of a crowd and announcer screaming his name

He stands a moment drawn towards this beast

It’s as if some link had been formed between animal and
man a link that Billy doesn’t want to break
Now two BULLFIGHTERS move to lure the bull away from
Billy And to keep Billy away from the bull

DOZIER

(pronounced “Doz-shur”) is one of the bullfighters A young
man with an open enthusiastic smile He gets right in
Billy’s face

DOZIER
(smiling)
It’s over Billy It’s over

Something in Dozier’s tone brings Billy out of this strange
reverie

The ROAR of the crowd is all around us People on their
feet cheering a hero

Now Billy hears the crowd He’s still got his hat in his
hand He waves it to the crowd takes a bow

As WE PULL BACK FURTHER we realize we’re not at some little
league stadium at a summer rodeo or even a local arena where
a couple of thousand people might show up for a regional
Were

INTO THOMAS and MACK CENTER - LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

The arena at UNLV This is the biggest moment in
professional bull riding The PBR Built Ford Tough World
Finals

A crowd of close to twenty thousand are on their feet
chanting “BO-DEEN -- BO-DEEN” as an ANNOUNCER’S VOICE comes
over the stadium PA

ANNOUNCER
This year’s winner of the PBR Built
Ford Tough World Finals For the
third time in three years With
scores tonight from the judges of
23 22 23 and 23 -- That’s 91 out
of a possible one hundred and his
fifth ninety plus of the season
and a season total of 72482
Billy Bodeen

Billy smiles and waves his hat Dozier comes running up
Gives him a bear hug
DOZIER
THREE-PETE BABY One time Billy
you’re gonna get off a bull and go
in the other direction

BILLY
You think so

DOZIER
(smiling)
Hell no

The crowd continues to cheer Billy turns to bask in it
taking it all in He sends his hat soaring towards the
stands

INT MANDALAY BAY - NIGHT

Very crowded Top Forty country blaring We’re following an
ice bucket on a waiter’s tray Sitting in the bucket not
the bottle of Kristal you’d expect but a quart of Bud

A TABLE BY THE STAGE

four young men in new Stetsons Billy flanked by three
other guys Bull riders like other celebrities have
posses There’s Dozier the bullfighter we met in the last
scene There’s MIKE NEEDHAM Billy’s driver and errand
runner and ANDY his manager

The waiter brings the bucket with the Bud in it to Billy’s
table Andy tips him

There are photographers there to capture the moment In
fact Andy probably sold this moment to Budweiser

Dozier and Billy are in the middle of a conversation

He pulls the bottle from the ice unscrews the cap and takes
a big swig

DOZIER
What are you guys gonna drink

ANDY
(to the waiter)
Better bring three more

MIKE
Honey dips at one o’clock
AT A TABLE NEARBY

Four women in their twenties doing Vegas They’ve been
watching all the action around Billy’s table

BILLY
smiles and gets up

BILLY
I’ll see what they’re having

He walks over to the four women The one in the front holds
his gaze JILL He takes off his hat

BILLY
You girls here to see Brad Harkins

JILL
He’s just about our favorite
BILLY
(nodding
Hell of a voice
(a beat)

You’re probably wondering what all
the excitement over at our table is
about

JILL
We were curious

BILLY
You see the fella over there
almost as good looking as he thinks
he is That’s Dozier Yates

ON DOZIER

He knows Bill’s talking about him Does a little muscle
flex

BACK WITH BILLY AND THE GIRLS
Dozier’s name clearly rings no bells

BILLY
You ladies follow rodeo at all

JILL
Not really My ex used to watch
the bull riding competitions

BILLY
Then he would know Dozier Dozier
Yates just might be the best
bullfighter in all of rodeo
(a beat)
The two other fellas there they
work for Billy Bodeen

He can see a hint of recognition on Jill’s face

BILLY
Just won the PBR World Finals -
like the World Series of bull
riding for the third time

Jill is getting the feeling that she might just be talking to
Billy Bodeen

JILL
That’s what the rest of you do
You work for this famous bull
rider

BILLY
Andy and Mike do Myself I don’t
really work for anyone

JILL
What do you do

BILLY
(cocky smile)
Whatever it takes

The lights dim The Music cuts off The crowd applauds in
anticipation The show is about to start

An MC welcomes us all to the Brad Harkins show here at the
Mandalay Bay “Opening the show tonight for Brad please
welcome Lacy Dickenson”

Polite applause Most of the crowd would rather get to
Brad

Lights come up on stage to reveal Harkins’ band the
Vanishing Cowboys as they vamp out an uptempo instrumental

And then LACY DICKENSON walks out on stage holding a guitar
In her late twenties you know she’s pretty but when you
look closer she’s heartstopping But there’s something more
there Something a little edgy Lacy heads right into a by-
the-numbers version of Faith Hill’s last single
BILLYS TABLE

Right up front

Jill and the other two girls are at the table now A waiter
brings more glasses and more to drink Everyone is basking
in Billy’s reflected glow

None of them are paying any attention at all to Lacy

They’re drinking flirting Mike signals the waiter for more
drinks As he does this he sees

WANDA CARLYLE

on her way to their table Wanda is a type you don’t see so
much anymore Tough always smoking or chewing gun Perfect

figure in tight jeans Tan and athletic and no nonsense

MIKE
Wanda Carlyle three o’clock

BILLY
You’ve got that radar thing down
don’t you

MIKE
Why I get paid the big bucks

Andy glances towards Wanda

ANDY
You be polite Billy

BILLY
I’m the soul of the southern
gentleman

His friends laugh

ANDY
Right

Wanda has reached their table Andy stands

ANDY
Hey Wanda

She smiles has eyes only for Billy

WANDA
I just want to stare
BILLY
You’re embarrassing me Wanda

WANDA
Six point two million dollars in
sponsorships That’s what your
ride brought in Let me see your
ass

Billy stands up Wags his ass out there Dozier slaps him

DOZIER
Come on Work that “W”

Wanda checks out the W

WANDA
Good boy
(to Jill)
You hold tight to this one honey
This man can do more in eight
seconds than most men can ina
lifetime

Billy’s friends all hoot and holler at that one

ON STAGE

Lacy is working her way through this song She’s well aware
of this table in the front where no one is listening to her
These guys are pissing her off

BACK AT BILLY’S TABLE

Raucous Completely oblivious Lacy might as well be a
jukebox Andy sits back down

ANDY
Join us Wanda

BILLY
Sure We’1ll make room
(to Jill)
Come on up darling

He slaps his lap And Jill gets on Wanda looks at them
shakes her head

WANDA
I’ve got to get backstage
BILLY
You pay Brad Harkins to wear your
pants too

WANDA
Youre Goddamned right

BILLY
Who makes more money

WANDA
Up until this afternoon Brad
did a three time Finals winner

just might edge him out

Wanda walks off Jill makes no move to get off of Billy
In fact she turns and straddles his thigh

JILL
This how you sit on a bull

BILLY
You’re a natural darling

And to Jill’s delight and the loud hollers of his friends
Billy starts to bounce her on his knee Hard Giving her a
bull ride

LET’S INTERCUT A BIT

Lacy singing louder Getting madder

Billy and his pals getting rowdier Looks like Jills
going to get thrown any minute Why she has to wrap her
hands around the back of Billy’s neck to stay on

He “bucks” her His friends howl

OK THATS IT

Lacy brings her hand up in the air and stops the band They
stumble to a halt mid-chorus

The crowd is surprised
Billy and his friends are still messing around

LACY
Hey Ass-hole

That shuts the crowd up
LACY
You with the little chickey poo
on your knee

OK now Billy knows she means him He looks up smiling
Lacy unstraps her guitar She holds it out to him

LACY
You want to come up here and do
this

Billy far from being offended is taken with her spunk

BILLY
Naw You go right ahead on

LACY
I’m trying to but you’re making
too much noise

The whole crowd is taking this in
IN THE WINGS

LARRY LEFTON Brad Harkins’ manager He does not like what
he’s seeing here

A guy in new jeans a fresh hat and a star’s smile comes up
to stand with him Clearly it’s BRAD HARKINS Brad is
watching the stage with admiration

ON STAGE

LACY
Maybe you don’t like the song
Tell you the truth it’s not one of
my favorites either You have a
request

Billy gestures Me

LACY
Yeah you It’s all about you
isn’t it So whatever you want to
hear I’m sure the audience
wouldn’t mind

Billy smiles at his friends What the hell He looks at
Dozier Dozier makes the most cliched suggestion in concert
history The one every drunk in every audience makes

DOZIER
(a prankster)
“Freebird”

BILLY
Yeah “Freebird” Good one
Dozier

The others laugh too Billy looks at Lacy

BILLY
How about it Can you play it

Lacy gives him a supremely confident look She can play it
She hits a chord on her guitar and begins to play Wait a
minute this sounds all right It’s a slow and surprisingly
moving version of the intro to “Freebird”

and then Lacy starts to sing
Oh my God If you thought she was pretty before what
happens when she opens her mouth and lets go It’s really
something It carries you away
Billy’s knee has stopped bouncing but Jill is not coming
off The guys are all still smiling but Billy senses
something

IN THE WINGS

Brad Harkins smiles to himself He knows a good thing when
he hears one Even Larry Lefton is listening

Lacy is wonderful

Mike nudges Dozier Look at Billy He’s in love

ON STAGE

She started out doing this cause she was mad but now Lacy’s
into it She stops playing guitar and just sings Acapella
It’s devastating

Billy can’t take his eyes off Lacy

And she’s looking right at him beating him down with every
ounce of her vocal paying back every drunk in every bar
she ever played but the harder she goes after him the

more she senses something happening between the two of them

But just when the band would come in just when the song
should explode she turns to the band does a four count

and they come right back in on the song they were covering
when Lacy stopped the band

The crowd thinks this was all part of the act There’s
applause But we’re on Billy studying her The others at
the table are laughing going back to what it was but
Billy’s heard something

Jill’s wriggling around on his lap “Show me how to ride”

Almost unconsciously he lifts her off his lap and puts her
back in her own seat She’s not happy about this but
Billy has forgotten her and everything else in the world

When the song is over Billy is on his feet in an instant
Clapping Hollering

His boys get up too A moment later so does the rest of the
audience

Lacy stares at Billy Bodeen right in front of her in the
audience standing clapping Then she takes off her guitar
and drops it to the stage where it lets out an ear-pealing
ring of feedback as she storms off

INT MANDALAY BAY - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
Lefton is in the middle of yelling at Lacy
LEFTON
You don’t ever walk off Brad
Harkins’ stage You do your God

LEFTON

Christ Just do your Goddamned

They both turn Billy’s there holding Lacy’s guitar

BILLY

BILLY

LEFTON
It’s my decision yes

BILLY
Then I want to ask you what was
your name

LEFTON
Larry Larry Lefton

BILLY
I wanted to ask you Mr Lefton
please not to fire this lady not
on account of my bad behavior and
general assholiness

He smiles at Lacy Lefton is about to say something but

before he can Brad Harkins has joined them

BRAD
“Fire” Nobody’s getting fired
around here lLacy’s adding two
songs to her set every night and
I’m hoping one of them will be
“Freebird”

LARRY
Brad

BRAD
Hell Larry she’s the “T-shirt”
act She can do whatever she
wants Nobody’s listening anyway

He smiles at her He turns to Billy
BRAD
Brad Harkins Billy Watched your
ride today on the bus Damn fine
Congratulations

They shake hands

LACY
Can I have my guitar back

Billy turns as Lacy snatches her guitar from his hands

looks right at her

BILLY
You can make something beautiful
with that You ought to treat it
with a little more respect

Lacy is surprised This guy is lecturing her

LACY
You’ve got to be kidding me

And she walks off down the hall Billy watches her go

watches Billy

INT ELEVATOR - NIGHT

startled look she turns

EXT LACY’S FLOOR OF THE HOTEL - NIGHT

Flowers Mountains of flowers Waist deep Everything you

A floral carpet

stretching all the way down the hallway to her room

LEFTON
Oh Lord Now you’re gonna
fuck him

She’s enjoying this She starts down the hall through the
thousands and thousands of flowers Somewhere a phone is
RINGING

NEAR THE DOOR TO HER ROOM

Roses The ringing seems to be coming from there She
pushes aside the flowers and finds a six foot tall teddy bear
blocking her door It’s holding a cell phone

Lacy takes the phone and answers it

EXT HOTEL - NIGHT

Billy in the passenger seat of an Escalade Dozier in the
middle Mike behind the wheel Billy’s on his cell phone

BILLY
(in a cool voice)

Lacy hangs up the phone Lefton shakes his head

LEFTON

She smiles at Lefton

LACY

bullrider

CLOSE ON THE FACE OF A BULLFIGHTER

These guys are said to have the most dangerous job in all of
rodeo Under the get-up we recognize Billy’s pal Dozier

He’s got his hands high in the air working a crowd siking

them up as WE PULL BACK TO

INT THE STAPLES CENTER - NIGHT

A big exhibition bull ride in LA We hear a TV commentator
Jack Dunlap calling the event From the first you hear his
voice you know he’s been there himself

JACK
Our first rider is Douglas Rake a
young man off the island of Kauai
who has taken the Hawaiian islands
All State twice This is his first
ride here on the mainland and he’s
coming out of the gate on a bull
called Blind Rage He gives his
gate man the nod The gate opens
and all he’s got is God and his
bull rope

The gate opens Bull and rider come out in a ball of fury
It’s over in less than a second

JACK
And Alooooooha Douglas

As the rider falls on his back in the dirt pulls himself up
and starts to run Dozier moves into action

Part of a bullfighter’s skill is to make his escapes look
close This bull is chasing Dozier around the arena Dozier
runs around behind him grabs the bull by the tail The bull
spins with Dozier pretending to be pulled around until
finally Dozier climbs the fence getting out of the bull’s
way He throws his hands up in the air The crowd ROARS

IN THE BOOTH
JACK DUNLAP is the quintessential cowboyphilosopher

Comfortable with himself and all his failings Comfortable
with life

JACK

(smiling at Dozier’s

antics)
And another narrow escape for our
bullfighter Dozier Yates We have
a treat for you folks joining us
in the booth today is Dozier’s old
friend and mine Billy Bodeen who
just five days ago won the PBR
World Finals out there in Las
Vegas Thanks for coming in
Billy

Billy is sitting next to Jack head-set on He smiles goes
into “broadcast mode” along with Jack

BILLY
Glad to be here Jack

JACK
That last ride just shows you how
difficult this sport is wouldn’t
you say

BILLY
Well as you know a lot of it has
to do with what bull you draw

JACK
I got to tell you some of today’s
bulls are truly fierce competitors

BILLY
They were no walk in the park back
when you were riding either Jack

JACK

They get bigger and badder every
time I talk about them

(a beat)

That was back in the day Just
about the time you and I met

BILLY
That’s right I was ten

JACK

And as tough as you were crazy
I’1l1 tell you folks I haven’t seen
someone fall and get back up on the
bull so many times in one day than
watching little Billy

Billy doesn’t know where he’s going with this

BILLY
Like I always tell people I may be
ugly but I sure am stupid

Jack smiles This banter is for the audience but you can
see in the way they look at each other that the two men
really like each other

JACK
We’re gonna have a lot of time to
talk to Billy Bodeen more about
stupidity and bulls and his own
eight seconds right after this

Commercial cued Jack turns to Billy They’re off-mike now
and Jack gives Billy a good long look

JACK
How the hell are you

BILLY
I’m good It’s been good

JACK
You’re still on top of the world
Some Goddamn ride

BILLY
(he knows it was)
Thanks Almost as good as you used
to be

Jack looks at him serious now for a moment

JACK
You could be but you got
something else going on up in that
head of yours You always did

BILLY
You still got the school going out
there in Santa Fe

JACK
This thing didn’t pay in my day I
got to run the school do a little
announcing just to keep both of my
ex wives in cigarettes and toilet
paper

Someone brings him a crib sheet He glances at it

JACK
You know anything about this new
bull Jimmy Meeker has going today

BILLY
Naw but if Meeker’s pushing him
I’m sure we’re all gonna get an
earful

JACK
(smiling)
Calls him “the Beast”

BILLY
That’s a little bit what do you
call it presumptuous

JACK
Way I hear it this bull owns it

BILLY
According to Jim Meeker

The booth gives them the “back in “Five Four Three Two”
count and Jack swings back into action

JACK
Welcome back everyone Just
talking with Billy Bodeen three
time Finals Champion about Jimmy
Meeker’s new bull the Beast This
Bull’s been tearing up the
Northwestern Circuit Billy Hes
hurt a couple of riders pretty bad

BILLY
We can always use another good
bull Jack but I’m sorry to hear
any of the boys got hurt

JACK
Bones heal and ladies love scars

Billy couldn’t agree more and he smiles at Jack

JACK
Let’s see how Hank Warrington does
climbing up now and about to ride
the Beast

IN THE ARENA

as a cowboy in white cowboy shirt and blue jeans climbs up to
mount his bull

IN THE BOOTH
Jack smiles appreciatively

JACK
Goodness That is a beautiful
creature

Billy leans forward to try to get a better look at the Beast
We push in on him as Jack continues

JACK
This is our first look at this bull
and from what I can see I have to
tell you I’ve never seen an animal
this size

IN THE CHUTES

HANK WARRINGTON lowers himself onto the rippling muscular
back of a huge bull

Of this monster all we catch are glimpses Because the
moment HANK is on his back THE BEAST CLIMBS THE CHUTE

JACK (VO)
AND NEITHER HAS HANK WARRINGTON
THE BEAST IS CLIMBING THE CHUTE
HANK IS TRAPPED HE CANT GET HIS
ROPE UNTIED

Hank is trapped The flankman and another cowboy try to get
the chute open The Beast’s thrashing has jammed it shut

The Beast thrusts forward and Hank’s head hits the bar
knocking him unconscious The bull keeps bucking

Dozier and the other bullfighters move in desperately trying
to get to the unconscious Hank -- to get his rope untied

The Beast is thrashing ramming Hank into a corner of the
chute The cowboys are struggling with the gate

they finally get it open A beat

and then the Beast comes out into the arena

Dozier and the others look up as the bull’s huge flank blurs
by heading back for the pens

DOZIER

God Damn That’s a whole lot of

rage
The Beast disappears into the pens
IN THE BOOTH
Billy’s still caught up in what he just saw 0S Jack is
saying that we’re going to be seeing one heck of a lot more
of this bull
INT LOAD OUT - NIGHT
Where the bulls are kept after an event Handlers crews

Rodeo is big business This looks like the load out after a
stadium rock show

Billy walks through it all

People stop Nod A couple of cowboys come up to shake his
hand But Billy is focused Determined

JIMMY MEEKER is by the holding pen where the Beast is being
loaded out A slick fifty year old who wears rodeo suits and
a hat with a brim crusted in diamonds he is rodeo’s answer
to Don King

MEEKER
Billy Bodeen Pride of Beaumont
Come to take a look at the future

He takes Billy’s elbow guides him through the crowd
MEEKER
Make way here We’ve got a
historic meeting taking place
People get out of the way
UP AHEAD

Billy can see the Beast in his pen As he takes his first
good look so do we

Jesus you can’t believe this monster up close A wonder of
nature Bigger badder than any bull ever If you’ve never
seen a rodeo if you couldn’t care less you will still think
this is one of the most beautiful creatures you’ve ever seen

The Beast is calm now but as Billy approaches he seems to
sense an adversary He paws and snorts Jimmy Meeker is
still talking a streak about his finest bull ever a whole
new dimension in bull riding “The riders day is over boy
with the Beast the bull becomes the star”

- but Billy isn’t listening He has gone right up to the
pen Meeker is going on “Go ahead boy give him the once
around”

But Billy just stands there a man looking at his destiny
right there in front of him An announcer’s voice comes up
from the next scene “Opening the show tonight a warm Los
Angeles welcome to Lacy Dickenson”

INT UNIVERSAL AMPHITHEATER - NIGHT

FROM BACKSTAGE IN POV as WE MOVE OUT ONTO THE STAGE (Were
Lacy’s POV) There’s the band the lights so bright you can
only see the first couple of rows of the crowd There’s the
buzz of amplifiers and then the vamp as the band kicks in
Up-tempo driving

ON LACY

She looks as comfortable up here as Billy does on a bull
Her hand wraps around the microphone

Then she sees something
HER POV

There in the front row Billy All alone No posse He
sits there in the front row and he’s there to listen Guess
he figured out what he had to do to get a girl like Lacy to
give him a second glance

LACY

takes that in A beat She walks back to the guitar player
says something in his ear He nods Looks at the band The
vamp changes Over it Lacy says

LACY
Thank you all so much This one’s
one of my own

And she begins to sing Pure and perfect cowpop
Infectious melody clever lyrics a song about the promise
of love “I wont settle for anything less than love this
time”

Thing is she’s singing just for Billy

Thing is he knows it

By the time this song is over Billy Bodeen will be ass-deep
in love

INT BACK-STAGE - NIGHT

The between set crush Billy makes his way through the
crowd Over the heads of the hangers out and on he can see
Lacy’s dressing room door He pushes his way to it Shes
sitting and she looks up sees him reflected in her mirrors
She smiles reaches over and takes something from her
dressing room table The cell phone that was in the bear
She tosses it to him

BILLY
Awe shit you did get the flowers

LACY
Does that sort of bullshit get you
laid

BILLY
All the time

LACY
Really

BILLY
Absolutely

LACY
So many breasts around town so few
brains

BILLY
(a nice long beat)
So now that I’ve met the brains
what does it take to get you to go
out with me I need to read you a
book

Lacy gives that a beat of her own Then she smiles

LACY
Naw You already figured it out

We’re moving along the side of this Big Rig The words
“Billy Bodeen three time PBR Built Ford Tough champion” and
a logo of a bull on fire emblazoned on the trailer We can
hear Billy’s voice coming from inside the bus

BILLY (0S)
Put your ass tight up here against
it Squeeze on it

OK
INT BILLY’S TOUR BUS - NIGHT

Lacy is on the back of a rickety old mechanical bull Thing
must be 30 years old Billy’s standing facing her Right
now he’s rubbing his hand along her inner thigh I should
mention that this truck is a movable state-of-the art gym
with all sort of equipment as well as the mechanical bull
No expense spared Very cool

BILLY
You feel that

LACY
Yeah

BILLY

Those are the muscles that are
going to keep you locked on You
sure you feel it

He smiles They both know they’re doing the clay scene from
“Ghost” but they don’t give a shit that’s part of the fun

LACY
I feel it

BILLY
OK So you’ve eased on down onto
him He’s in the chute You can
feel all that power between your
legs

LACY
(amused but turned on)
Yeah

BILLY
First you want to grab the rope
You can’t do this without a glove

He reaches back pulls a glove from the wall where there are
lots hanging

BILLY
Here We got to rosin you up

He grabs some rosin begins to rub it into the glove which is
now on her hand

BILLY
Now you want to take that glove and
run it up and down along the rope
getting it all sticky
(a beat)
I do it thirty-six times

LACY
Why

BILLY
That’s a bull’s standing heart
rate

LACY

You’re a little superstitious

BILLY
I like to do things right

She wraps her hand around the rope and rubs it up and down
suggestively

LACY
Like this

BILLY
Just like that
(a beat)
Now we’ve got to tie you up

He takes the rope and starts to wrap it around her hand
tying her to this mechanical bull the way a rider would tie
himself to a bull Billy slowly rocks the bull back and
forth

BILLY
Slowly carefully your ride is
over when your hand comes off this

rope

He suddenly snaps the bull forward forcing her to lose her
balance with her hand coming off the rope He grabs her as
she falls back and pulls her close They’re face to face

LACY
You gonna kiss me cowboy

BILLY
Once

And he turns to her and they kiss As they kiss he unwinds
the rope lifts her off the mechanical bull and takes her in
his arms

And then they explode They’re all over each other They
can’t get to it too quickly

CLOSE ON THE FLANK OF A BULL

Rippling muscles His brand A couple of scars
THE HAUNCHES

All that power

THE EYES

All that fury

CLOSE ON BILLY

checking out this bull like a driver checking out a car
There is a buzz the buzz of a huge crowd

EXT COLORADO STATE FAIRGROUNDS - NIGHT

Billy is in the pens in the bowels of the stadium face to
face with this bull He studies the animal and the animal
studies him Billy sees whatever it is he’s looking for A
faint smile

The wranglers run the bull into the chute while Billy walks
over Couple of the guys from the circuit are there
including a cowboy named EUGENE He’s with Hank the guy who
got thrown in the chute by the Beast

EUGENE
You do your little “I’m one with
the bull” moment Billy

Billy just keeps walking Eugene looks at Hank

Billy climbs the rails to the chute We can see the
monogrammed spurs “Bodeen” on each one The bull is ready
now Billy lowers himself down Ties himself on Then he
does something else He reaches down under the bull’s chest
gently

Eugene is watching this So is Hank
BILLY

He closes his eyes and takes a beat concentrating A moment
of meditation ON THE TRACK faintly we hear a heartbeat

Then Billy sits up nods to the boys the chute opens The
bull is airborne and all our sound drains away

And we’re with Billy on a ride What it means to be with
Billy We’re calm The eye of the storm Like the opening
but this time we see the full poetry of the ride the
magnificence of 2000 pounds of Brahma the near balletic
grace of Billy

From his POV this is eight seconds of pure unadulterated
peace fluid like riding a wave His body dances in sync
with the bull as if her were a part of the animal

The clock ticks over another second

The clock ticks another one

Look at Billy ride

And then the buzzer He’s gone the eight

Billy dismounts The sound of the crowd comes crashing back
in He stands drawn as always towards the bull he sees
Lacy in the stands For just an instant he loses focus
And in that instant the bull charges

Dozier is right there to come between Billy and the bull
-- but it stops Billy for just a moment Nothing like that
has ever happened to him before As he doffs his hat to the
crowd he looks at Lacy again They exchange a smile

INT BILLY’S TRUCK

Lacy slammed against a wall Billy with her They’re going
at each other again A song of Lacy’s comes UP ON THE TRACK

and continues as we go to

EXT SHORELINE AMPHITHEATER - MOUNTAIN VIEW CALIFORNIA -—
NIGHT

Lacy on her “ride” playing to an appreciative crowd in her
zone as much as Billy is in his The song is kicking
driving sexy

INT SHORELINE AMPHITHEATER - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Brad stands with Lefton watching smiling THE SONG
CONTINUES AS WE GO

EXT ANOTHER STATE FAIRGROUNDS - NIGHT

A big swirling cloud of dirt This bull’s hindquarters have
risen a good four feet in the air and plumes of dirt and
gravel obscure our view A moving dustball of Billy and
this bull

EXT SHORELINE AMPHITHEATER - NIGHT
Lacy at the microphone Really in it Strumming hard
EXT STATE FAIRGROUNDS

The ride the way it looks to Andy and Mike sitting in the
private box up front The way it looks to the fans Like a
man hanging on for dear life on the back of a bucking Brahma
bull Billy’s dismount is a slide over the bull’s horns and
he just keeps on going until he reaches the fence then he
turns as always drawn towards the bull even as Dozier moves
in to distract the bull Billy tosses his hat to an adoring
crowd

EXT SHORELINE AMPHITHEATER - NIGHT

Lacy ends her song with a flourish and the roar of her crowd
is right there to greet her She comes off stage to find
Brad and Lefton waiting in the wings Brad still applauding

Someone hands her water and a towel As she towels off Brad
says to her

BRAD
(shaking his head)
I love the way you get a crowd all

worked up I got to spank myself
for not noticing sooner Nice set
Lacy girl

He reaches out to her with his fist

BRAD
Tag team darlin’ Now it’s my
turn

She laughs and taps his fist as he rolls out on stage She
turns and watches Brad as he does his thing rocking the
crowd

A ROADIE approaches with a cell phone

ROADIE
You’ve got a call

He hands the phone to Lacy She smiles

LACY
Hi

She turns away from the wings to get away from the noise
starts backstage

INT COLORADO STATE FAIRGROUNDS

BACK BY THE LOAD OUT Billy’s got a towel of his own around
his neck (DURING THEIR CALL INTERCUT AS NECESSARY

There’s a pause Around them their various loadouts are
winding down It’s time to say goodbye and neither of them
wants to

BILLY
Did I mention that you missed me
LACY
You’re the last thing I think
about
BILLY

Good name for a song

LACY

As Lacy hangs up Larry’s standing there

INT POODLES HILLTOP BAR - AUSTIN - NIGHT

Guy Clark on stage singing a heart-wrenching version of
“Desperados Waiting for a Train” There’s moving and then
there’s a song like this

THE AUDIENCE

Appreciative quiet caught up in this simple magnificent
story of a boy and his first hero

Lacy and Billy are right up front Lacy knows the song by
heart Guy is nearing the end of the tale

“The day fore he died I went to see him

“T was grown and he was almost gone

“So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
“And sang one more verse to that old song

(spoken)

“Come on Jack that son-of-a-bitch is comin

Lacy looks over at Billy She sees tears in his eyes Damn
it that really gets to her She squeezes his hand

EXT ST LOUIS ARENA - DAY
Billy and Lacy coming into the arena with Andy and Mike

Lacy watches him go Andy watches her

INT LOCKER ROOMS - DAY

Billy doing his 36 swipes with the rosin on his rope Eugene
and the other cowboys are there

HANK
(to Billy)
Did you hear the Beast put Butch
Stone in the hospital last night up
in Abilene Eugene’s looking at a
world of hurt

Billy stops looks at Eugene

EUGENE
Looks like I could use a little of
your cosmic cowboy shit on me
today

BILLY
Youll do fine Eugene Just close
you eyes and pretend you’re on that
girl from Cleveland

Hank laughs Billy looks Eugene in the eye
BILLY

You’re a good rider Eugene

You’1l take him
He gives Eugene a nod Walks out of the dressing room
EXT THE PENS
As Billy comes out and finds his first bull He stands
facing the animal eye to eye That ritual of his He
doesn’t even notice the cowboys talking until he hears some
“Hey beautiful you come to see me” kind of chatter He
turns and sees
LACY

watching him She smiles but his face has tightened

BILLY
What’re you doing back here

LACY
I couldn’t resist I just wanted
to see what you do

He’s looking at her like she’s a total stranger

LACY
Billy

BILLY
(cold)
Go back out with Andy and Mike
I’‘1ll see you after like I said

LACY
Don’t talk to me like that

He gently takes her elbow walks her away from the pens
BILLY
You’re right I’m sorry I’11l see

you after

Not much of an apology He backs away back to the pens not
waiting for her to respond

His bull waits in the chute now Cowboys all around getting
ready Billy does his wrap and then he bends down as we saw
him do before over the bull He listens
There’s a young BULL RIDER doing his stretches sanding his
gloves watching Billy The on-grounds DOCTOR is nearby
Stethoscope around his neck and cowboy hat on his head
DOCTOR
I always wonder what that’s all
about

YOUNG BULL RIDER
He’s looking for the bull’s heart

IN THE STANDS

Lacy and the boys take their seats

IN THE CHUTE

Billy sits up nods and launches out of the chute

This ride we see entirely from the stands

What a ride The ring announcer tells us it’s his first of
three today and Billy Bodeen is showing just what made him
the PBR champion three years running

Lacy tensing up
The buzzer Billy is off the bull and then he does that
crazy thing he does his inevitable pull towards the

animal

Dozier comes between Billy and the bull

DOZIER
Nice ride Your favorite monster’s
coming up a little later

EXT BEHIND THE SCENES AT THE RODEO - DAY

Billy’s done for the day coming out towards his truck which
is parked down under the stadium Andy and Mike are there
waiting with Lacy Andy steps up he’s got business to
discuss Billy moves past him and goes right to Lacy He
scoops her up a totally different guy than he was before his
ride He smothers her with kisses and apologies

ANDY
Woa Hey lover there’s a Ford
shoot for the new Ranger this
afternoon and you’ve got an ESPN
interview in an hour

LACY
Busy man

Andy shoots a look at Lacy She notices As they walk away
she says

LACY
(laughing a little)
I don’t think he likes me

BILLY
It’s his job as my manager not to
like you

LACY
Look about before “Don’t come in

the dressing room before the show”
I get that But that doesn’t give
you license to treat me like shit

BILLY
(still kissing on her)
You’re right You’re right

A beat She smiles She’s forgiven him

LACY
So all of that what you go
through getting ready training
all for eight seconds

BILLY
You have no idea how long eight
seconds is

LACY
Don’t I

She leans over kisses him We see her fingers coming up
slowly a second at a time When she gets to eight she
stops kissing

BILLY
Why’d you stop

LACY
You have no idea how long eight
seconds is

BILLY
Can I go another eight

And they are in each other’s arms As they start into the
truck Andy shouts

ANDY
I need you back here in one hour

Billy waves without turning around From behind him we hear
the announcer “Three more rides to go Some fine bulls and
some fine riders”

MIKE
Hey Billy Eugene’s gonna ride the
Beast
Billy hesitates
LACY

The Beast’1ll be there tomorrow
You come along with me now I
promise it ain’t gonna hurt

INT TRUCK - DAY

More clothes coming off Soft kisses

EXT ARENA

Eugene climbs the rail as the Announcer lets us know that
“Eugene Warrington is about to try his luck and skill on the
still unridable Beast”

INT THE TRUCK

Lacy and Dozier doing what they do best (We INTERCUT to
them as needed through the rest of this scene)

EXT ARENA — DAY

Eugene with a great deal of focus lowers himself onto the
Beast

Like a football player Dozier squats in readiness watching
as the chute opens

and it lasts about a second and a half before the Beast
throws Eugene against the rails

Eugene stumbles to his feet as Dozier and the other
bullfighters move in

Sensing prey the Beast turns going right at Dozier

Now Dozier must do his job He runs in between the Beast and
Eugene getting the bull’s attention by grabbing his ear

Eugene crawls away to safety with the help of a couple of
WRANGLERS

Here comes the bastard again He’s too quick He gets right
up on Dozier Instinct saves him as he drops flat in the
dirt and crawls under the Beast

The crowd goes wild Half of them thrilled half of them
wanting blood

Dozier makes it under the Beast and dives for the waiting
barrel

Before Dozier can get all the way into the barrel the beast
slams into it thrusting Dozier in like a cannonball He
smashes his shoulder But the bull isn’t finished He rears
and drop-kicks the barrel

NOW WE’RE INSIDE THE BARREL

looking out through the slats At horns at hooves And
at CRACKING WOOD The barrel is getting slammed tossed
and battered as if it’s in the middle of a tornado Crammed
and in pain all Dozier can do is wait it out and hope his
buddies distract this monster The sound is deafening The
Beast won’t quit until Dozier’s dead

Suddenly it all stops

There is quiet except for the anxious crowd and the announcer
trying to be encouraging

LOOKING OUT FROM INSIDE THE HOLE

The barrel is on its side Faces appear as the other
bullfighters squat down to see how badly hurt Dozier is

BULLFIGHTER
Jesus

INT TRUCK
They are heavy into it when they hear the pounding on the
door Billy tries to ignore it but the pounding continues

He hears Mike’s voice “Billy”

He gets up pulls on his pants opens the door Mike stands
there He looks upset

MIKE
It’s Dozier

INT INFIRMARY - NIGHT

We’re on a episode of Cheaters Some poor girl finding out
her fiancé has been married for eight years

Around the room are the cowboys who got hurt in today’s
rodeo Guys with their legs torn open smoking drinking
beers while they get stitched up Eugene has a dislocated
arm and he’s having his cheek sewed back on

ON CHEATERS

The girl is losing it Falling apart

IN HIS BED

Dozier’s eyes are watery He has one arm in a shoulder-to-
fingers cast

Someone’s stitching his face up something which he finds
annoying ‘cause it gets in the way of him watching the show
He winces -- at what’s happening on TV

DOZIER
That poor little thing She didn’t
see it coming at all

He means it He’s sentimental Mike is with him watching

MIKE
She’s a chump then It was plain
as the nose on her face

DOZIER
I’1ll take the nose clean off your
face you keep talking like that
about that sweet little girl

The door opens and Billy and Andy come in Billy says his
hellos as he comes through

BILLY
Looks like he took a piece of you
Eugene

EUGENE

I could feel it in the chute The
fucker’s crazy

BILLY
You hang in there Eugene

Billy moves past him over to Dozier’s bed Dozier does not
look up at Billy and Andy

DOZIER
You two sit quiet for a moment
we’re just coming to the
confrontation

ON TV

Exactly Joey Greco is bringing the girl to the club where
her fiancé and his wife have just finished dancing

BILLY
How you feeling Hipshot

DOZIER
(intent on the show)
Shhhh

ANDY
We’re trying to show you a little
sympathy here

MIKE
He hurts like hell but he’s not
going to take his pain meds until
the show is over He’s afraid
he’‘1l miss something

The show has gone to commercial Dozier mutes it and turns
to Billy with a serious look on his face

DOZIER

I never thought there was any such
thing as a mean bull I figure
it’s just instinct you know “Get
the hell off my back” but that
sucker’s out for blood

(a beat)
You’re getting the idea to ride
that bull aren’t you

Billy doesn’t answer

DOZIER
Don’t

He lets that sink in The commercial has ended

DOZIER
Your time’s up I got to see if
Loretta is gonna be fool enough to
take him back

He turns the volume up
INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Later Lacy’s asleep Billy’s not He’s got the volume
down and he’s on ESPN A segment on bull-riding

It’s all about new bulls And this part is all about the
Beast who has just been awarded “Newcomer of the Year” and
the bucking bull awards in North Dakota Ty Murray is being
interviewed

TY
The biggest wildcard in the sport
is the bull You never know You
might draw a little fellow with a
bad attitude

(MORE)

TY (contd)
I knew one old boy rode Bodacious
once when he was as mellow as a
dairy cow But this new bull the
Beast You only have to look in
his eyes He’s a killer It’s
only a matter of time before this
bad boy takes someone down

Billy is so focused on the TV that he barely notices that
Lacy is awake now She’s watching too She wraps herself
around him as if she could keep him safe

BILLY
Hey

A light kiss He smiles at her then puts his head down on
her chest Listening

LACY
What are you doing

BILLY
Listening for your heart

She smiles really touched She’s falling for him She
holds him tighter He holds her but his eyes are still on

Billy is a rodeo star

Soon their horses are neck and neck

Lacy glances over at Billy She’s dead set on beating him
But Billy does something unexpected He takes himself out of
the saddle stands for a moment balanced with one foot ina

stirrup then leaps from his horse onto Lacy’s

He winds up behind her on her saddle He puts his arms
around her

She leans back into him and kisses him

animation of a rodeo bullfighter reaching into a barrel - the
way they used to do it Before the Bull’s name has appeared

said reading from the screen

INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Billy on his phone calling Lacy Intercut with her hotel
room as needed

BILLY

LACY
We’re doing background vocals

be his next single

BILLY
No shit You were right about this
being your big break

LACY
You don’t have to worry I think
my “heart’s” still intact

BILLY
(a smile)
I found somebody else

LACY

BILLY
Little Brahma bull by the name of
the Beast

INT LOCKERS - CULLMAN ARENA -—- DAY

Billy suited up and ready to ride is doing his swipes of
the rope There are other riders here one guy drinking a
beer and complaining about the bull he drew another on his
knees He has crosses on his gloves and he’s praying to a
wooden crucifix hanging from his locker Billy focuses on
this man as he prepares Dozier is there with him talking
a mile a minute

DOZIER
He’s weighing in at a little under
2000 pounds He comes out of the
chute full throttle and it just
gets worse

We start to INTERCUT Dozier’s voice continues (OVER)
EXT THE PENS
THE BEAST
being run to the chute Spoiling for a fight
DOZIER (V0O)
He’1l land hard on his front feet
and then turn back under himself
Try to take you down the well right
out of the chute
EXT RAMP - CULLMAN ARENA - DAY
Billy and Dozier headed for the chutes
DOZIER
He’s lean and he is mean I hear

Meeker cross-bred him with a serial
killer out of the Midwest

THE BEAST
slams against the sides of the chute angrily as he enters
BILLY

climbs up into position

BELOW HIM
The greyish white seething back of the Beast

Dozier is still giving Billy last minute advice while Billy
gets ready to ride

DOZIER
That doesn’t play he’1ll reverse
and buck try to slide you up over
his spikes and once you’re on the
dirt he’1ll let you think he’s
gonna gore you but don’t roll
run

BILLY
I got it Dozier I got it

BILLY
drops down onto the Beast’s back This bull is huge
His flank man hands him his bull rope

FLANK MAN
Wide as hell isn’t he

He rubs his rosin-coated glove over the rope and when it’s
good and sticky he begins to wrap the “tail” of the rope
around his hand

Billy leans down now His “find the heart” ritual A beat
There’s nothing there He can’t find it We don’t hear it

DOZIER
(to himself)
That beast don’t have heart

If he does Billy can’t find it He gives up sits up and
concentrates

THE BEAST

slams against the sides of the chute Billy steadies himself
on the rail focusing A beat He nods to the Gate Man

The chute yanks open

For a split of a split second the Beast does nothing Just
long enough for Billy to blink in confusion

BOOM The Beast then explodes out the gate in a fury
DOZIER
can’t believe this Looks at Andy
DOZIER

He waited How smart is this son

of a bitch
Andy shakes his head as
We come out of the chute with Billy For a moment we’re his
POV a rearing jolting nauseating BLUR that takes in sky
crowd and dirt in a messy half a second

THIS RIDE WE WATCH IN REAL TIME

Billy keeps his eyes locked on the Beast’s head anticipating
his moves

The head ducks down That means a buck coming Billy leans
back pushing down with his roped hand

The Beast’s first buck is one of those mid-air hind quarter
twists that no one can withstand

Billy slides across the Beast’s back until he’s almost
parallel to the ground as the bull begins a spin to the left

BILLYS POV
A whip Dirt gravel The Beast’s neck as he whirls around
THE ARENA

The Beast spins coming dangerously close to the railing
It’s as if he were going to smear Billy against these rails

THE JUDGES

moving to keep out of the way They’re as worried as
everyone else

THE CROWD

On their feet Oh shit Billy’s going down

BILLY

is trying to ride into the spin but there’s no quiet up here
for him This is not locking in No zone The Beast is
keeping it so tight that if Billy falls he’1ll be trampled
DOZIER

Not working yet just watching with Andy and Mike And this
hurts to watch

BILLY

somehow rights himself re-seats as the Beast gives another
massive buck

THE CROWD

goes crazy

And so it goes

The Beast bucks and slams viciously and Billy somehow holds
on the crowd is in agony Cheering one moment ooing the
next

Billy goes with the bull through a full spin to the left
then the Beast reverses spinning to the right Billy
manages to hang on pulling himself back on top of the bull

Billy’s friends are anxious This might be Billy’s greatest
ride or the end of his career

Jim Meeker is anxious too He wants his bull to throw this
punk

WE SEE THE CLOCK

As the seconds tick by Four Five

JUST BEFORE THE SIXTH SECOND

we go inside Billy’s head again The cool quiet peace of
his ride The last seconds of peace Billy Bodeen will know
for a very long time

THE CLOCK

trips over to six

THE CROWD

All standing now Roaring

DOZIER AND THE OTHERS

Hats off cheering

BILLY

only needs two seconds more
THE BEAST

lowers his head to the ground Billy sees this and leans in
but the bull doesn’t try to flip him over his horns

Instead he slams his head back up
BILLY

We’‘re still in the quiet slow motion calm of Billy’s head
FOR A LAST MOMENT and then

time speeds up to normal and sound comes rushing back in
and the cheers of the crowd turn to screams of horror as

The full weight of the Beast’s enormous neck comes racing
up

BILLYS POV

He sees that huge white neck for just a moment

BILLY

The head-on collision with the bull’s neck COMPLETELY CRUSHES
EVERY BONE IN BILLY’S FACE

AND THEN DARKNESS FOR A GOOD LONG MOMENT

until finally a distant voice someone saying

LACY
Billy Billy

We’re Billy’s POV as his eyes open
INT INFIRMARY - DAY

Lacy stands looking down on him She’s got a warm smile
but her eyes are wet

Billy’s entire head is bandaged

someone at the door

Just in time She smiles The doctor continues to unwrap
Now we can see the monster underneath One day soon Billy
Bodeen will look pretty much like Billy Bodeen but that

day is still a ways away Right now he looks like shit

His lips curl into something his muscles must think is a
smile and he says to Lacy

BILLY
Hi honey

Lacy tries to look as if this isn’t a shock But Billy can
see it in her eyes

He gets up limps over to the dresser mirror When he sees
himself he whistles or something close It’s hard to make
much of a sound through that mouth

BILLY
How long before I start to look
human

DOCTOR

Take another couple of weeks for
the swelling to drop You’re
looking at two three months before
youll start to really see any
difference

(catching Lacy’s eye in
the mirror)

unlike a woman is not meant to be
ridden

OK he’s trying to piss Lacy off and he’s succeeding She
gets up He’s got an untouched meal in front of him and a
bottle of Rebel Yell on the table

Lacy picks up his plate She’s pissed off She dumps the
plate in his lap

We’re sort of stalled I guess
you would say

DRESSMAKER
Never recovered from that hit he
took did he

LACY

DRESSMAKER

My first husband was a long haul
trucker One night a deer comes
out of nowhere bolts across the
road My husband he was a prick
but he loved animals He hits the
brakes Turns the truck on its
side and it jackknifes The cab
spins into the oncoming traffic
Collides with a pick-up He walks
away from the accident with just
some scratches and a sprained
ankle but he was no good after
that Couldn’t even get on the
bumper cars at an amusement park
unless he’d had a six pack under
his belt

LACY
That why you broke up

DRESSMAKER
Nah I was sleeping with his boss
Him not working he was around the
house more and he picked up the
phone at an inappropriate time

She stops She knows now what she really knew all along
There’s no stopping this ride She looks up into Billys
eyes suddenly he feels the pumping the Beast’s heart full
and strong Billy smiles

Lacy smiles back

Billy sits up

Her eyes on him quietly to herself Lacy says

LACY
Come home to me

Billy nods to the Gate Man
The chute opens
And we are into Billy Bodeen’s last ride

The Beast pulls out every trick he knows invents a few more
The spin the reverse the buck the twist the body roll

able to find the zone

AND THEN IT HAPPENS

Billy finds his way back -- ALL THE SOUND DRAINS FROM OUR
PICTURE AND TIME SEEMS TO STAND STILL

And we are back with Billy where we were on that first ride
IN THE ZONE

every single thing in life makes sense

THE BEAST

goes airborne again Magnificent but knowing he’s not going

LACY

hears the exultation of the crowd She stops just as
THE CLOCK

kicks over to eight seconds

We can hear the buzzer sound

BILLY

He knows he’s done it But he’s not ready to dismount
DOZIER

Watches knowing he’s gone past the buzzer

THE CROWD

All on their feet now screaming cheering

And then finally Billy begins to free his hand from the
rope

And then

The Beast does exactly what Dozier said he would do on
Billy’s first ride He drops his head and Billy is flipped
over his horns and onto the ground

BILLY

hits the ground impossibly hard as the Beast charges
ANDY AND MIKE

This is bad and they know it

DOZIER

races to get between the two of them but he can’t get past
the Beast’s huge hind legs

He is kicked back against the fence for trying
