He wants you to know he’s tried
everything

What he’s done to the company is
just the start His depression is
an ink that stains all who touch
him A black hole that swallows all
who get near

A wad of mashed potatoes SPLATS next to Henry Other kids
LAUGH If Henry notices he doesn’t show it

THE BEAVER (VO) (CONTD)
Henry his youngest has become
what his teachers call ‘hermit

gets it

QUICK CUTS
CLOSE ON the self help books being packed into a box

CLOSE ON the medications being swept into another box

Meredith CRYING in the driveway behind him He turns

THE BEAVER (VO)
- and says the only thing left to
say

EXT WALTER’S HOUSE - DAY

Their eyes connect It’s awkward Do you wave when you’re
being thrown out He begins to massage his eyebrows with his
thumb and forefinger

Finally he puts the car in drive She crosses her arms
swallows her tears As she watches him drive away

THE BEAVER (VO)
Goodbye

FADE TO BLACK
INT SCHOOL LIBRARY
Porter sits across from JARED a confused athletic type

JARED
Cc minus

Porter grabs a paper off the desk waves it at Jared

PORTER
Jared youre failing the class
And this writing sample could
probably get you committed in
several states You really think
you can suddenly hand in an A paper
and get away with it

JARED
But I can get a fucking C-
PORTER
Excellent Good luck to you
Porter starts to leave
JARED
What about Hector You just got him
an A in Family Development
Porter starts to massage his eyebrows exactly as we saw

Walter do Realizing it he suddenly stops and disciplines
himself by SNAPPING a big rubber band on his wrist

Frustrated he takes out his Journal of Similarities
notebook As he adds Massaging Eyebrows to the list

PORTER
I’ve never written anything for
Hector If he told you different
he’s aliar

(closing his notebook)

But hypothetically if I had
written Hector an A paper it
certainly wouldn’t have been right
out of the box Hypothetically he
would have come to me a long time
ago and we would have raised his
grades incrementally And he would
have been responsible for
memorizing the facts in the papers
I wrote so that he wouldn’t miss
test questions over the same
information And if that had
happened then yes he might have
turned in an A paper and he might
even be making a solid B in a class
he used to be failing

(MORE)
PORTER (CONTD)
So if someone else was asking me
to do this for them to not only
write them a paper but to do it as
them with their voice at their
skill level then I would say that
they could éither do it my way or
they could take their chances
buying some piece of shit off the
internet

Jared thinks this over

JARED
150 every time

PORTER
(sing-song)
Responsible regulars receive
reduced rates

Porter slides a book across the table Jared SIGHS He opens
it puts 150 in and slides it back Porter nods and stands

JARED
I gotta pass this class to graduate
you know
PORTER

Wilkins from your team last year
The one who thought the words
igneous and ignorant were
interchangeable Where’s he now

JARED
Playing for OSU

Porter nods
PORTER
Youll get the grades All you have

to do is make people believe
they’re yours

Porter walks away

NORAH cheerleader outfit the kind of girl you’re either
hopelessly in love with hopelessly jealous of or both
breaks away from friends to catch up

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Norah glides in beside him

NORAH

steps before realizing it She comes back He seems annoyed

Porter considers this A long beat

PORTER

She quickly hands him a paper from her bag
NORAH

more by tomorrow
Porter looks at the paper
PORTER

He starts away

NORAH

Without looking back
PORTER
Don’t forget to bring cash
INT SUBURBAN - DAY

Meredith waits in SUV gridlock outside the elementary school
She scans the crowd but can’t find Henry

Suddenly the passenger door opens and seemingly from
nowhere petite Henry hoists himself in

HENRY
You passed me again

MEREDITH
I was looking
Henry shrugs His demeanor is very quiet flat As she starts
to drive

MEREDITH (CONTD)
How was your day

Another shrug

MEREDITH (CONTD)
Did you talk to anyone

HENRY
I guess
MEREDITH
New person or old person
HENRY
New
MEREDITH

Good What did you talk about

HENRY
(matter of fact)
He said I was a ball licker and I
told him I wasn’t and he threw me
in the dumpster

Meredith is aghast Henry shows no emotion

MEREDITH
What Did you tell your teacher

HENRY
She got me out of the dumpster

Meredith suppresses her urge to cry as if she’s been trained
calms her voice and says something that sounds rehearsed

MEREDITH
This is why the doctor wants youto
focus on coming out of your shell
When you spend so much time alone
the other kids see you as a target

Henry nods as if he’s also heard it before A silent beat

HENRY
Is Dad gone

She looks at him trying to measure how he feels about this
question Henry gives nothing away

MEREDITH
He’s not gone dear We just agreed
that it’s better for us all if we
don’t live together anymore
gbeat)
How does that make you feel

Henry shrugs

EXT LIQOUR STORE - EVENING

Walter comes out with two large bags of CLINKING liquor When
he gets to the car he realizes there’s no room for them

CLOSE ON Walter’s trunk being opened

CLOSE ON a dumpster Boxes are tossed in We see that they’re
the ones full of self help books and medication

Cyothes follow Files Awards Yearbooks A set of golf
clubs

NEW ANGLE shows Walter emptying the final items out of the
backseat He throws them in the dumpster

Walter stares at what he’s done his life mixed in with the
garbage He looks sleepy

He leaves then stops slowly comes back eyeing something

ANGLE ON the garbage reveals a half buried BEAVER PUPPET its
large plastic eyes staring out from under some refuse

Walter squints then reaches for it It turns out to have a
large bushy tail and big happy grin He holds it up

He and the beaver seem to stare blankly at one another for a
long time as if each reading a story in the other’s eyes

CLOSE ON the trunk again as the two large bags full of liquor
are tossed into the now empty space

A beat then

The beaver puppet is tossed in too The lid SLAMS down

INT HOTEL ROOM - EVENING

ANGLE ON the bed as we hear the DOOR OPEN the BOTTLES being
set on the ground

Suddenly Walter falls into bed with his shoes on He pulls a
pillow over his head He sleeps

INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

The room is a wreck Sheets clothes empty bottles

ANGLE ON a bottle of sleeping pills opened and half gone We
follow a trail of the little pink pills until we come to

WALTER sitting on the floor shooting whiskey straight the
beaver puppet now on his left hand He’s WEEPING

On the TV Alan Thicke is having a heart to heart with Kirk
Cameron in a GROWING PAINS episode

ALAN THICKE
(on tv)
This is a very SP special lace Mike
My father built this cabin by hand

KIRK CAMERON
(on tv)
Wow No tools or anything Cool

This seems very profound to Walter Still CRYING he LAUGHS
along with the audience and moves toward the TV hugs it

WALTER
(drunk)
Beautiful

He takes a shot of whiskey and then pours some on the screen
as if pouring it down Alan Thicke’s throat

WALTER (CONTD)
There you go

ANGLE ON the TV again as Walter continues pouring whiskey on
the screen Alan and Kirk hug

Something breaks in Walter He drops the bottle

Along beat as he looks around the room his face suddenly
blank

CUT TO

INT HOTEL BATHROOM

Walter has fashioned a necktie into a noose around the shower
rod

He SOBS as he steps up onto the edge of the bathtub knees
bent and tightens it around his neck

He takes a few deep breaths and closes his eyes A long beat

He inches his feet to the very edge of the bathtub and then
finally lets them slip off

His weight drops onto the noose but it suspends him for
barely a second before the whole rod comes down dropping him
into the tub backwards with a tremendous CRASH

His feet hang out of the tub the rest of him invisible
motionless

SILENCE

CUT TO

INT HOTEL ROOM
ANGLE ON the shower rod as it DRAGS across the carpet

Reveal Walter still fastened to the rod by his tie trudging
toward the balcony Drops of blood dot the back of his shirt

EXT HOTEL BALCONYINT HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Walter puts a chair next to the railing climbs up He takes
rickety steps uP until he’s balanced very tenuously on the
edge of the railing

He looks down a solid ten stories

The tie pulling at his neck the shower rod hanging behind
him BANGING against the balcony in the breeze he looks
resigned A GUST of wind almost tips him forward

He takes a breath seems to decide he’s ready He raises his
arms as if to swan dive

And then suddenly he catches a glimpse of the beaver puppet
on his left hand He eyes it as if he’d forgotten all about
it He brings it close They stare one another down

As he stares he starts to tip forward about to fall but at
the last moment he overcorrects and instead tips backward
toward the room

He falls over the chair and through the open door CRASHING
into the dresser before falling backward onto the ground

A quiet beat until we notice that the shower rod has gotten

wrapped around the TV and is slowly pulling it toward the

edge of the dresser just above the seemingly unconscious
alter

A beat and then the TV tips off landing flat on Walter’s
head with a MEATY THUD

SILENCE
CUT TO

INT BLACK KITCHEN - NIGHT

Meredith Porter and Henry eat at the table The awkwardness
indicates this is not a regular thing

PORTER
Don’t get me wrong I’m glad you
kicked him out But the whole
eating at the table in response to
family drama thing I mean how
long do you see us keeping this up

MEREDITH

I don’t know How about until we

start treating one another with

some respect And asking each other

about our day And you two start
aying yes ma’am and no ma’am And

helping with the dishes And-

PORTER
Maybe I should get a paper route
too
A long beat then

CUT TO

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Meredith Henry and Porter sit with their dinner in their
laps watching The Daily Show Only Jon Stewart speaks
INT HOTEL ROOM
Walter blinks awake on the floor The TV is flat against his
face literally sitting on his head Between it and the

d

carpet his fie of vision is narrow

Suddenly he raises his left arm so the beaver puppet is all
he can see A long beat then

THE BEAVER
Hello mate

When The Beaver speaks we recognize the crisp accent from
the narration

Walter’s lips still move so there’s no confusion about where
the sound actually comes from but for a hand puppet The
Beaver is strangely animated

When Walter speaks it’s in his own tired groggy voice so
that despite one of them being a puppet they seem to be
having a real back and forth conversation

WALTER
Who are you

THE BEAVER
Bloody hell Look at you Stone
drunk and flattened by a
television

(MORE )
THE BEAVER (CONTD)
Quite an obituary you’re working
out for yourself yeah

WALTER

FADE TO BLACK

AFTERNOON

Porter is in the stands reading GENETIC PSYCHOLOGY TODAY as

Norah is practicing with the cheerleaders on the floor

The COACH calls a break Norah splits from the others

her bags and moves up to where Porter is

He closes the magazine She looks at it

NORAH
(reading)
Genetic Psychology Today

grabs
He puts the magazine into his bag

PORTER
Bookstore was out of US Weekly

He digs her sample out of his bag He hands it back She’s

surprised
NORAH
You don’t need it anymore I
brought others-

PORTER
I’m not doing it

She’s stunned

NORAH
What Why

He starts speak but stops suddenly He hears something A

faint WHISTLE each time he exhales

He mashes at his nose until it goes away then SNAPS the

rubber band on his wrist and continues

PORTER
Because that’s an excellent paper
You’re an excellent writer Which
means that the only reason for me
to do this would be because you
can’t be bothered to do it

yourself I’m sure shaking pom poms

and being anorexic is a ful

schedule I bet if you put your

mind to it you can work this in
He stands gathers his things

NORAH
Wait a minute

PORTER

You know it’s one thing to get by

on your looks when it’s all youve
got But for someone like you it’s
just lazy If youre stuck for a
topic maybe you should just go

with that Short skirts nose jobs

and get someone else to do it
Worked for me kids

He starts to go Norah looks floored The Coach yells from

the gym floor

COACH
Norah Let’s go

NORAH
Hold on

She SLAMS her bag on the ground starts pulling out papers
She slaps them on the ground

NORAH (CONTD)
(angry ¥
Does that look lazy to you

Porter stops Turns She keeps pulling more stacking them

NORAH (CONTD)
I write 10 page papers in an hour
and half for easy A

The stack keeps growing heading for War and Peace territory

NORAH (CONTD)
Do you have any idea how many times
I’ve tried to write this stupid
thing

She throws a last set on top

NORAH (CONT D)
That’s 428 pages of laz Thats
six months of lazy Tha s 63
different opening jokes famous
quotes and follow your rainbow
inspirational bullshit of lazy

The whole squad is watching from the floor Porter is clearly
uncomfortable

NORAH (CONTD)
(starting to tear up)

I’ve worked harder and longer on
this stupid pointless speech with
less to show for it than anything
I’ve ever done in my life And if

ou don’t want to take my money

ecause of some insecurity based
bullshit then fine But don’t you
dare call me fucking lazy

She hurls her bag at his feet and heads down the stairs
returning to the wide eyed squad As she goes

NORAH (CONTD)
Asshole

Porter looks stunned embarrassed He eyes the stack of
papers by his feet

The faint WHISTLE in his breathing returns

INT SUBURBAN - DAY

Meredith scans the elementary kids again She reaches the
TEACHER at the end of the line She rolls down her window

MEREDITH
I’m sorry He just blends in I

must have missed him again

TEACHER
No Mr Black already got him
MEREDITH
Walter
TEACHER
Said he sent you a text Quite a
character

That doesn’t sound like

MEREDITH
You’re sure it was Walter

Someone HONKS The teacher moves on Meredith checks her
phone Sure enough there’s a text

EXT DRIVEWAY INT GARAGE - AFTERNOON

Meredith wheels into the driveway opens the garage door

As it rises she sees Henry bent over a workbench surrounded
by wood sawdust and tools

When he sees her he looks up beaming He seems like an
entirely different kid

As Meredith gets out he runs toward her
HENRY
Mom mom You gotta see what we
did Come on

She’s stunned by his excitement He takes her hand starts
pulling

MEREDITH
Okay okay

As he’s dragging her toward the workbench

MEREDITH (CONTD)
Where is your father

Henry doesn’t hear her Instead he picks up a simple but
impressive wooden box He hands it to her

HENRY oo
You put your memory in it

She looks it over impressed confused It strikes her as a
little nice to have come from her garage

MEREDITH
Where did this come from

HENRY
We made it

MEREDITH
You and your dad

HENRY
Me and The Beaver

MEREDITH
The beaver

Just then Walter steps from the house into the garage a
smile as rare and bright as Henry’s on his face He seems
genuinely excited to see her

But before he speaks Walter raises his left hand revealing
the beaver puppet

The Beaver does the talking

THE BEAVER
Hello love Was just about to call
you Any idea where Walter stuffed
the power sander you gave him two
Christmases ago

Meredith is stunned into silence

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
No No trouble We’1ll make do
(to Walter)
Give her the thing

Walter hands her a 3x5 sized card with a message printed on
it He then moves past her and joins Henry at the workbench

Meredith looks at the card

MEREDITH
(reading)
Hello The person who handed you
this card is under the care o
prescription puppet designed to-
(looking up at Walter)
Walter what the hell is going on

Walter and Henry begin sanding by hand

THE BEAVER

Just some male bonding love The
boy here practically démanded a
gentlemen’s club but I won him
over with the promise of power
tools

Henry LAUGHS Meredith can’t help but gape at the rare sound

MEREDITH
I mean what

She moves closer to Walter lowers her voice

MEREDITH (CONTD)
What are you doing here We agreed

THE BEAVER

Did Henry show you the box Kid’s a
natural I thought we’d nail a 2x4
to the wall call it a shelf but
the boy he’s tongue and grove this
and miter saw that I think his
head might be made out of wood

He KNOCKS on Henry’s head as the boy continues to LAUGH but
this time it’s not enough Meredith wants answers

MEREDITH
Walter Seriously

Walter and The Beaver look at one another The Beaver turns
to Henry

THE BEAVER
Henry mate why don’t you run
inside see if you can find that
varnish we were talking about

Henry drops his sandpaper and takes off like a shot Walter
and The Beaver turn to Meredith

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
Did you read the card

MEREDITH
Yes but-

THE BEAVER
Read the card

She raises the card again

MEREDITH

(grudgingly reading)
Hello The person who handed you
this card is under the care o
prescription puppet designed to

elp create a psychological

distance between himself and the
negative aspects of his
personality Please treat him as
you normally would put address
yourself to the puppet until such
time as it is no longer necessary
Failure to do so will jeopardize
his hard won therapeutic gains
Thank you

She looks up

THE BEAVER
There you go

MEREDITH
Is this some kind of joke

THE BEAVER
Hardly love it’s-

MEREDITH
Will you stop with the puppet

Walter looks at The Beaver The Beaver nods Walter takes a
breath lowers the puppet - His voice is much closer to the
x

tired monotone we hea earlier
WALTER
Happy
MEREDITH

No Walter I’m very confused

WALTER
Meredith this is a breakthrough
He says that if I stick with it we
can knock down-

MEREDITH
Who says

A long beat as Walter thinks about this one He looks to The
Beaver for guidance Finally

WALTER
Dr Macy

MEREDITH
Dr Macy I thought you quit seeing
him

WALTER
I went back

MEREDITH

So this is some kind of program

Walter raises The Beaver again

THE BEAVER

I’1l1 field that one The answer is
yes Meredith that’s exactly what
it is I know it seems radical but
that’s because it has to be In
cases like Walter’s cases where
all else has failed it’s proven
quite effective

(MORE)

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
But for it to work he’s got to
really commit to cleaning
psychological house and starting
over and you could go a long way
toward facilitating his progress if
you could just work with him on

is

Meredith thinks on this for a second She looks past The
Beaver and right at Walter

MEREDITH
And he really thinks this will
work

Walter slides The Beaver back into her eye line

THE BEAVER
Absolutely It’s very big in
Sweden

She’s about to say more when Henry comes back from inside

HENRY
I can’t find it

THE BEAVER
Not a problem mate What you say
we get this mess cleaned up We’11l
worry with the varnish next time

HENRY
You’re not leaving are you

THE BEAVER
Don’t worry I’1l come round this
weekend we’ll finish it up

HENRY
No you have to stay for dinner
Mom let him stay for dinner

THE BEAVER
That’s all right mate I’ll-

Meredith looks at Henry’s pleading expression

MEREDITH
It’s okay You it’s okay For
dinner

Henry CHEERS Meredith is still stunned by his demeanor

Walter turns to her He looks like he wants to say something
but can’t He just nods then turns The Beaver to Henry

THE BEAVER
Right then Let’s clean up the
garage so we can make a mess in the
kitchen yeah

HENRY
Yeah

Walter joins Henry as Meredith stares unsure whose
transformation to be more shocked by

INT FOYER - EVENING

Porter enters reading from the giant stack of papers that
Norah threw in front of him He stops He hears LAUGHTER

INT KITCHEN - EVENING

Porter steps in to see Walter using The Beaver to toss a
salad grabbing fistfuls in its jaws with little GROWLS

Henry and Meredith LAUGH at this as they cook

PORTER
What - the - fuck

They all look up Meredith stops laughing Before she can say
anything Walter turns The Beaver toward Porter

THE BEAVER
Ah there he is

Walter moves as if he might hug Porter Porter recoils but

when Walter gets close he simply hands over one of his
cards

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
We were afraid we’d have to start
without you
Porter reads the card silently He looks up

PORTER
This a joke right

THE BEAVER
No son it’s a fresh start

Porter gapes at The Beaver for a moment then looks past him

PORTER
Have you completely lost your mind

THE BEAVER
Well I know it looks a little-

PORTER
I’m not asking you nut job I’m
asking mom

Meredith starts to say something but Porter cuts her off

PORTER (CONTD)
It takes you years to finally get
rid of him and you let him come
back the next night with a talking
puppet
(beat)

I knew you were weak but Christ

MEREDITH
Porter-

But he’s already walked out

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
The TV is on the Daily Show again

NEW ANGLE reveals that Porter is the only one eating in front
of it

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Walter Henry and Meredith are at the table As they eat
Meredith is clearly still smarting from Porter’s words

She focuses on the memory box which sits just in front of her
plate As she handles it she tries to put on a smile again

MEREDITH
I can’t believe you guys made this
You never I mean Walter never
I’m sorry I’m not clear on how I’m
supposed to address you

THE BEAVER
You’re doing fine love

MEREDITH
I mean the tools were always on
your Christmas lists but I just
assumed it was ahobby youd never
actually start I had no idea you
knew how to

She indicates the box

HENRY
He’s a beaver mom that’s what
they do

THE BEAVER

Spot on mate

Walter holds The Beaver towards Henry He exchanges a high
five with The Beaver’s tiny paw

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
But you know Walter wasn’t half
bad himself at one time

HENRY
Yeah Who taught him

THE BEAVER
Well I suppose he taught himself
He was about your age yeah Cub
scouts He and his pop were
supposed to make a race car for a
contest Only his Pop wasn’t
around so ng had to do it himself

HENRY
Where was his dad
INT LIVING ROOM
Porter hears this question and MUTES the TV He looks toward
the kitchen
INT KITCHEN - INTERCUT
Meredith gives Walter a look

Walter absent ly drags lines through his food with his fork as
he thinks ear a faint WHISTLE in his breaths like the
sound Porter disciplined himself for making earlier

Finally

THE BEAVER
He was in an accident Passed away
HENRY
You mean grandpa From the
graveyard
THE BEAVER

Right-o Anyway Walter had
grandpa’s tools but not a clue how
to use them Every time he hammered
or sawed or chiselled on his block
of wood it just got uglier and
uglier BY the time he was done it
looked like he’d taken something a
dog had chewed up and screwed
wheels on it

Henry LAUGHS Meredith is listening not touching her food

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
Now all these other kids’ cars the
ones they’d built with their dads
they were things of beauty And
then here was Walter’s aerodynamic
as a billboard ugly as sin

(MOR F)

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
So you know what the other kid’s
called it

Henry shakes his head

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
The Turd

Henry loves it

THE BEAVER (CONTD)

If youd seen it you’d think that
was generous Funny part is when
they pactual ly got down to racing

Turd could not be beat All
those sanded and shiny opponents
The Turd left them in the dust Won
the whole contest that little
mess

HENRY
Sweet

THE BEAVER
Well the other kids didn’t think
They teased him about it

Y

endless Turd Master that was
his new name

Suddenly this resonates with Henry

ENRY
What did he do

THE BEAVER
Got some books and some wood and
he taught himself all there was to
know about those tools How to make
things precise neat clean
smooth Worked until he was better
than most of the other kids’
fathers And when the next year’s
contest came he turned in a car
that looked like it belonged in a
bloody museum

HENRY
Did he win

THE BEAVER

Didn’t even race See by then it
didn’t matter how good his car
looked All the other kids saw was
that it was Walter’s They called
it Te Turd II

(beat )

So he told them to piss off and
took it home

We see Porter listening closely unconsciously drawing little
lines in his food just like Walte

HENRY
That sucks

THE BEAVER
Indeed mate Indeed But Walter
doesn’t have to worry about those
kinds of things anymore You know
why

HENRY
Why

THE BEAVER
Because he’s got me

Walter goes back to eating Meredith watches Henry

HENRY
Dad can we make a turd

THE BEAVER
Anytime mate Anytime

HENRY
Let’s do it tomorrow
INT HENRY’S ROOM

Walter tucks Henry in He kisses him on each cheek one with
his lips one with The Beaver’s

HENRY
Good night Beaver

THE BEAVER
Good night mate

Walter flips out the light

INT HALLWAY
Walter joins Meredith They move down to Porter’s doorway

MEREDITH
Porter your dad’s leaving You
want to say goodbye

Porter gets up from his desk walks toward the doorway like
he might say something Instéad he SLAMS the door in their
faces Loud MUSIC quickly follows from within

Meredith moves to reopen it but Walter grabs her arm
THE BEAVER

He’s a teenager love We’d only
have to worry if he liked us

She lowers her arm A beat

MEREDITH
Do you have far to go I mean you
can stay on the couch if you need
to

THE BEAVER
That’s all right The hotel is
actually closer to the office
We’ve got a big day tomorrow

He gives her a quick kiss on the cheek and starts down the
stairs

A moment before something occurs to her She steps to the top
of the stairs

MEREDITH
You’re supposed to go to work like
this

THE BEAVER

(without looking back)
Bright and early love bright and
early

She watches him go suddenly concerned

INT PORTER’S BEDROOM

Porter is walking around on his cell Norah’s pages in hand

NORAH
(filter)
ello
PORTER

Norah It’s Porter Listen about
what I said earlier-

NORAH
Are you going to help me or not

PORTER
Well I’ve been reading your
stuff and I think maybe if we
talked more about what youre
trying to say-

NORAH
Fine Come by after school
tomorrow
PORTER
Um—

She hangs up Porter puts the phone down He looks satisfied
mildly upbeat

Then he looks out his window and sees Walter getting in his
car Walter looks up sees Porter and raises The Beaver to
wave goodbye

And like that Porter goes south He sits on his bed to think
and finds himself instinctively massaging his eyebrows as we
saw before The faint WHISTLE in his breaths returns

He catches himself doing these things and in a flash of
frustration pounds on his head with his fists

Unsatisfied he pulls a poster from the wall revealing the
large dent we saw earlier and begins POUNDING his head into
the drywall

EXT BLACK HOUSE - NIGHT

CLOSE ON the outside of Porter’s wall where his blows force
cracks in the stucco With each hit chips fall away until we
finally hear a heavy THUD followed by SILENCE

FADE TO BLACK

EXT STREET - MORNING

Walter is jogging Pull back to reveal that he’s holding The
beaver in front of him as he does almost a hood ornament

INT HOTEL BATHROOM - MORNING

Walter showers He soaps himself and The Beaver

INT HOTEL ROOM - MORNING
Walter stands in a towel BLOW DRYING The Beaver
QUICK CUTS
WALTER PRESSES a suit The Beaver guides the iron
WALTER STRAIGHTENS his tie

WALTER COMBS The Beaver’s fur

INT HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

Walter regards himself and The Beaver in the mirror He looks
like a Brooks Brothers model with a beaver on his hand

He stares at The Beaver for a long beat He looks nervous
Finally

THE BEAVER
Trust me mate Today will be
different
INT OFFICE - MORNING

A wide shot shows rows of cubes No one’s here yet There’s a
small card in the center of each desk

CLOSE ON a single desk The card is the same therapeutic
caution card Walter gave to Meredith and Porter

NEW ANGLE inside of a pair of cubes the card in the center
of the desks

NEW ANGLE inside of an office The same situation

NEW ANGLE as EMPLOYEES begin to stream in A couple get to
their desks They pick up the card They look at one another
WIF

EXT OFFICE - MORNING

As people stream in we see a large sign on the front door
It reads ALL HANDS MEETING - CAFETERIA 9AM - NO EXCEPTIONS

They MURMUR about this as they pass

INT CAFETERIA - 9AM

EMPLOYEES take seats and TALK many of them holding and
discussing the cards

THE VP walks in also carrying a card A SKEPTICAL MAN grabs
him

SKEPTICAL MAN
What the hell is this

The VP looks as confused as everyone else

THE VP
I have no idea

a SKEPTICAL MAN
This is layoffs isn’t it

Suddenly the room goes QUIET as everyone looks at The VP for
his answer

Then from the front of the room

THE BEAVER
No one’s getting laid off
All the heads whip around to find Walter standing before
The Beaver raised and held forward

them

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
Get rid of you all and I’ve no one
to boss around yeah

Thundering SILENCE

ANGLE ON Walter and The Beaver

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
Good Morning I assume you all got
the cards informing you of the new
arrangements here but if not

allow me to briefly explain As you
know Walter Black ascended to CEO
here nearly two years ago not
through any particular skill or
merit but because the hooker our
founder took to dinner did not know
the Heimlich maneuver It was a job
Walter was ill prepared to handle
and his deteriorating mental health
since then has led to lapses in
focus judgement and eight
straight losing quarters that leave
us facing impending bankruptcy

That is why as of now he is
resigning

Quiet MURMURING

Now the MURMURS become LOUD CHATTER and DISMAY

ANGLE ON The VP who takes a chair bewildered

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
And putting me in charge

He clears his throat

ANGLE ON Walter and The Beaver Walter motions for quiet

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
Five minutes mates then you may
tear me to shreds if you like

A modicum of SILENCE returns

GROANS

THE BEAVER (CONTD)

As my first order of business as
CEO I want to take this opportunity
to announce some significant
reforms and goal realignments

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
First I am rolling back the
cumbersome approval process

instituted by my predecessor

(MORE)
THE BEAVER (CONTD)
The truth is he had no idea what
he was doing and he reacted to his
fear by attempting to micromanage
people and projects that were
outside his area of expertise As
of this moment Iam ceding control
of all individual projects back to
the teams themselves No more
endless meetings and waiting for
the CEO’s blessing You will all be
free and entrusted to do the jobs
you were hired to do

This is the first thing they’ve heard that sounds good
Still they’re highly dubious of the source

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
Second we have lacked anything
resembling a strategic plan as
Walter has pursued and abandoned
countless ill conceived new product
lines and handicapped them by
alternately interfering in their
development and sleeping for large
portions of the day As of this
moment we will cease work on all
but our two core lines Action Jack
and Princess Stephanie These are
high value properties that have
grown stale through mismanagement
and neglect We will revamp and
revitalize them and then we will
relaunch them at the International
Game and Toy Manufacturers Expo in
six weeks

Significant GRUMBLING

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
Thats a bloody difficult timeline
but I’ve prepared a schedule that
youll find in desk email when you
return to your desks which
demonstrates how by focusing on
these two lines exclusively and
eliminating bureaucratic delays it
is indeed achievable It has to be
The bottom line is that the expo
provides the only near term
opportunity for the significant
boost in orders that we require to
right our ship

A beat as he lets them digest this

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
Paeelt youre all highly
intelligent people so I can
imagine that you have a healthy
degree of skepticism regarding my
ability to lead under these
circumstances

Significant AGREEMENT

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
So I’m offering you the following
deal You will give me two weeks
At the end of that time anyone who
does not see significant
improvement and chooses to resign
will receive eight full months
severance and a glowing letter of
recommendation No questions asked
no exceptions

ANGLE ON the crowd This is quite an offer

ANGLE ON Walter and The Beaver He waits for quiet Then

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
Understand one thing my friends
This will become a great place to
work again You have my word on

a

From the back

MAN
And who exactly are you supposed
to be

THE BEAVER

Bollocks Did I forget to introduce
myself Apologies

CLOSE ON Walter’s lips He subtly bites the right corner of
his lower one before he says

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
You may simply call me The Beaver

CUT TO

INT NORAH’S ROOM

CLOSE ON Porter’s lips He’s biting his lower one exactly
like Walter as he takes in the room

It’s like a althoug case Awards medals ribbons plaques
everywhere although for a head cheerleader there’s nothing
particularly feminine no posters no pink etc

PORTER
(regarding the walls)
This is impressive

She shrugs it off Her attitude is all business

NORAH
So what do you need to know
PORTER
Right I guess the first thing we
have to figure out is what you want
to say

Well that’ s Renda the problem I
have no idea I mean I’ve been on
this track you know school
sports Stanford for like ever I
havent really had to think about
what’s next it’s just been
obvious So I don’t really know
what I’m supposed to say to people
who don’t have all that figured out
ye

PORTER
I see So your basic overachiever
needs help addressing the little
people speech - Have a nice summer
good luck in community college
Stuff like that

NORAH
You think you’ve got me all figured
out don’t you

TER
(looking around)
I’m piecing it together

NORAH
What I’m trying to say is that good
grades haven’t suddenly given me
this brilliant insight into what
everyone should do with their
lives If anything it’s the
opposite I mean when they were
expelling me from junior high no
one was asking for my advice but
get a few A’s and now I’m supposed
to have all the answers

PORTER
I’m sorry I must have misheard
you It sounded like you said
expelled

NORAH
That surprises you

PORTER
Depends on what it was for If it
had anything to do with Freeing
Tibet then no it doesn’t surprise
me at all

NORAH
How about graffiti

PORTER
Let me guess Stanford Rules in big
block letters

NORAH
More of an unauthorized mural I
was going through an ‘angry rebel
artist’ phase

PORTER
(shaking his head)
Sorry Not possible Does not
compute

NORAH
Yeah well it’s in my file So
see you don’t know everything

PORTER
And where’s all this angry rebel
artist stuff now

NORAH
I don’t know It was a long time
ago Why

PORTER

Why Because when the student body
president chess club champion
cheerleader valedictorian tells
you that she used to make defiant
Imasterpieces you kind of want to
see one

She just looks at him unsure

PORTER (CONTD)

You still have something don’t you
Come on Just one look and I’11
write you a speech you could run
for president with Please

She hesitates

NORAH
How about if you just agree to stop
being an ass

PORTER
Be easier to get you elected

She starts to turn away

PORTER (CONTD)
Okay okay okay I’1ll be good

(hand on his heart)
Promise

INT HALLWAY

Norah and Porter stand at the bedroom door next to her own
In addition to the knob there’s a padlocked latch

She dials in the combination CLICK As she opens the door

NORAH
We have to be quick

Porter suddenly isn’t sure what he’s getting into

INT NORAHS BROTHER’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
They step in to find a bedroom eerily similar to Norah’s own
Trophies awards ribbons plaques They aren’t carbon
copies but there’s a strong feeling of deja vu
Porter takes this in confused
PORTER
Whose room is this

NORAH
Used to be my brothers

She motions toward the one thing that makes this room
distinctly different from hers a painting on the far wall

NORAH (CONTD)
Well there you go

Porter looks it over It’s not bad Kind of frenzied
Impressionistic Interesting

PORTER
You did this
NORAH
Yes yes it’s very funny So now
youve seen it Let’s go
PORTER
No I mean it’s really good

Really
She’s not sure how to take this

ORAH
Well thanks

He goes back to looking at the painting A beat then she
goes to the closet opens it

NORAH (CONTD)
Actually I never understood why he
hung that one

She pulls out several canvases settles on one She holds it
up

NORAH (CONTD)
This was always my favorite

Porter steps over The style is similar but it’s brighter
more aggressive

PORTER
Wow

He starts to thumb through the others

PORTER (CONTD)
These are great Where did you
learn to do this

NORAH
I didn’t I mean I wasn’t serious
about it or anything It was just a
phase You know my brother was Mr
All American so I went out of my
way to be all artsy and rebellious
It was stupid

She starts to put the paintings away

PORTER

Why do you keep them in here
NORAH

I don’t I didn’t keep any of

these I threw them out The whole
thing was just to be weird and piss
off my parents Brian he’s the one
who pulled them out of the trash

PORTER
He must have really liked them

She closes the closet

NORAH

I don’t know about that I mean he
was always encouraging me telling
me how great I was how talented I
was but it felt like a big mind
game yoy know Like he’d read some
psycholo book that told him that
if he pre ended to like them I’d
give it up

She walks back to the painting on the wall

NORAH (CONTD)
See my parents they were always
trying to get me to quit
especially after I started painting
ls instead of canvases and
Brian he was always so concerned
about them telling me how my
getting into trouble was tearing
them up and stuff So I always
figured this was just his hyper
smart way of trying to get me in
ine

Porter hesitates

PORTER
Where’s your brother now

Norah looks at him as if the question surprises her as if
she thought it was something he already knew A beat

She walks to the corner and grabs the edge of a large desk
Suddenly she HEAVES and it GRINDS away from the wall

She stares at the floor in the corner Porter steps over
There painted onto the wood floor is the beginnings of what
might be a mural

NORAH

I got the idea from this magazine
Floor murals It was sort of my way
of making him admit that he didn’t
really like my stuff that he was
justtrying to manipulate me It
was like you like my shit well
here you go

She indicates the floor Porter nods but his face says he
doesn’t quite get it

NORAH (CONTD
I was grounded everybody was gone
And then he came home Caught me
He didn’t really get mad He just
looked at it for a long time and
then he walked out So I’ m
following him screaming ‘Don’t you
like it Aren’t I talented Aren’t
I great’ But he won’t say
anything He justgoes straight to
his car this is like 10 o’clock at
night and as he’s backing out he
smiles and shakes his head and
then really calmly he says ‘Don’t
worry « Well get it up before they
get ho

A long beat as she stares at the beginnings of the painting
mesmerized When she speaks her voice is on the edge of
cracking

NORAH (CONTD)

The weird thing was there was no
rain no ice no drunk driver I
mean the car didn’t even look that
bad It looked like something you
could have walked away from

A beat then she pushes the desk back into the corner

PORTER
I’m sorry

NORAH

When we went to get his car there
was all this floor fixing stuff in
the back Strippers sanders
varnish I remember my parents and
I we all stared at i and I kept
waiting for them to say something
to ask me something I wanted them
to But they didn’t They didn’t
say a word And then the next time
I came in here

(she pats the desk)
- this had been pushed into the
corner I mean it’s not like they
couldn’t figure out what happened
I guess they just felt like words
weren’t going to change it

Porter starts to say something when suddenly NORAH’S MOTHER
appears in the doorway

NORAHS MOM
What are you doing in here

She sounds more hurt than angry Norah doesn’t miss a beat
When she answers the emotional waver is replaced with upbeat
confidence

NORAH
I was just showing Porter some of
Brian’s awards He’s on the math
team with me

Norah’s mom steps in

NORAHS MOM
Oh Did you know Brian

PORTER
Um no ma’am Not really

NORAHS MOM
Oh

An awkward silence They’re all looking at the desk

NORAH
Well weve got some studying to
oO

Norah pushes Porter towards the door Her mom doesn’t say
anything At the door Norah looks back

Her mom is still just staring at the desk transfixed
Norah turns to Porter

NORAH (CONTD)
quiet)
You should go I’m sorry Do you
have enough to work with

PORTER
I’11 figure it out

Norah nods and turns back toward her mom

ORAH
(brightly)
Hey mom do you know where that
olarship notice is They wanted
a picture and bio but I don’t have
the address

As Porter exits Norah’s mom finally looks up nods

INT PORTER’S CAR INT WALTER’S OFFICE - SPLIT SCREEN

On the right half of the screen Porter gets into his car and
sits behind the wheel

On the left half of the screen Walter sits behind his desk
so that the tableaus almost match

CLOSE ON both their faces as they fall into what almost look
like identical pensive trances They each begin to tap their
chins with their index fingers
THE BEAVER (VO)
This is a picture of Walter Black
a hopelessly depressed individual

Slowly match pull backs on both until The Beaver becomes
visible in Walter’s frame

THE BEAVER (VO) (CONTD)
Who becomes a beaver

Then suddenly they both seem to wake at the same moment

When Porter realizes what he’s been doing he SNAPS the
rubber band on his wrist and starts his car

When Walter gets with it he turns to The Beaver nods

NEW ANGLE shows full screen on Walters office and whips
around to reveal THE VP and others sitting across the desk

They close their notepads and seem satisfied The VP looks at
Walter nods back

But then he just started screwing
his real secretary and I got the
house

ANN the Alpha mom in the bunch weighs in

ANN
It’s not healthy Dressing up like
a cheerleader doesn’t solve
anything it just covers up the
fact that something is seriously
wrong underneath

No one wants to follow that Ann looks at Meredith

Why Are you seeing someone

All the heads turn

MEREDITH
Well actually Walter and I have
been working on things

MEREDITH
Walter Walter wake up

Walter rouses pulling the mask off The Beaver’s eyes

THE BEAVER
What’s wrong love

MEREDITH
You need to talk to Henry He’s
down in the garage again

THE BEAVER
Well tell him to come to bed

MEREDITH
I’ve told him Walter I tell him
everyday He pays no attention to
me He needs to hear it from you
know
(indicating The Beaver)
ee you

INT GARAGE - LATE NIGHT

Walter comes out in his pajamas walks over to Henry looks
over his shoulder Henry looks up at Walter and The Beaver

HENRY
You couldn’t sleep either

THE BEAVER
Actually mate I was sleeping
quite well You know you can’t be
out here this late

HENRY
I just had this idea It’s gonna be
really great

THE BEAVER
Well let’s have it be great in the
morning yeah

HENRY

Just ten more minutes please Just
let me finish this last set of
cuts

The Beaver considers this

THE BEAVER
I let you have ten more minutes
you have to promise no more
working when your mother’s asked
you not to Not at night Not
during breakfast No bringing your
tools to the dentist Agreed

Walter puts forward The Beaver’s paw Henry shakes it

HENRY
Agreed

Walter starts to go
HENRY (CONTD)
Will you stay I like working with
you around
Walter stops

THE BEAVER
Sure

Henry smiles goes back to work Walter watches him for a
moment He turns to a table and grabs his own piece of wood

Walter and The Beaver begin to noodle on the wood A chip
here chisel there

HENRY
Will you talk to me I like it when
you talk

THE BEAVER

What would you like to talk about

HENRY
Doesn’t matter Just talk

Walter continues to work away
THE BEAVER
Very well You’re quite easily
entertained aren’t you

Suddenly Walter freezes He looks at Henry « There might as
well be a giant light bulb over Walter’s head

Walter turns back to his block of wood with a feverish
energy A beat

HENRY
You’re not talking
INT BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

Walter comes racing into the room heads straight for the
closet Meredith sits up in bed

MEREDITH
Did you talk to him

Walter comes out of the closet in the midst of changing into
a suit He heads into the bathroom

MEREDITH (CONTD)
Walter

THE BEAVER
Huh Oh Yes We had a good chat
He’ll stick to the schedule

MEREDITH
What are you doing

Walter comes out mostly dressed a tie loosely slung around
his neck He wrestles into some Shoes

THE BEAVER
Ive had a breakthrough love I’ve
got to get to work

MEREDITH
Now

THE BEAVER
Not a moment to spare

He starts for the door then pauses He comes back to bed to
kiss her goodbye

But this time Walter stands back and only kisses her cheek
with The Beaver

And then he’s gone Meredith looks after him with heavy
concern

INT OFFICE - MORNING

Walter works feverishly at a workstation The VP is the first
one in He spots Walter

THE VP
Sir You’re in early

Walter looks up He raises The Beaver

THE BEAVER
Ah Just the man I was hoping to
see Come over mate We’re going
to need to get going on this right
away

The VP takes a seat next to Walter Walter hands him the
piece of wood he was working on It’s been roughed out into
the crude likeness of a beaver

The VP looks at it He’s not sure what it means

THE VP
It’s a beaver

THE BEAVER
It’s the future It only occurred
to me last night that I’ve been
focus group testing it for weeks

E)
THE BEAVER (CONTD)
This is what we’ve been looking
for

The VP looks at the crude block again

THE VP
This

The Beaver directs his attention to the monitor

ANGLE ON the monitor where we see various schematics for
beaver toy with a toolkit

THE BEAVER
It’s a talking beaver woodworking
set You get the basic tools a
block of wood and a talking beaver
to work along side you

The VP looks it over

THE BEAVER (CONTD)

You should see the kids mate They
go crazy for the stuff They re
into the video games and cell
phones sure but you give them a

ammer a Saw and a block of wood
I’m telling your it comes natural
And as for the beaver I don’t want
to brag but there’s not a one of
them who wouldn’t take me home if
they could

THE VP
So you’re talking about a new
product line For what Christmas

THE BEAVER
Christmas I’m talking about right
now Today This morning

THE VP
But that’s impossible You said
yourself the only way we can get
the new Jack and Stephanie lines
ready is by-

THE BEAVER
Forget Jack and Stephanie This is
it right here

THE VP
But sir-

THE BEAVER
Action Jack and Princess Stephanie
can only hope to take us where
weve been This has the potential
to open up a whole new world of
opportunities I’m as sure of it as
I’ve ever been of anything

The VP looks at The Beaver then back at the screen

THE VP
I guess there could be an ancillary
market in more tools Maybe precut
lumber pieces Sort of like Lego
kits but made of wood and you work
them into shape on your own

Walter looks excited The Beaver musses The VP’s hair

THE BEAVER
Exactly Now you’re talking
THE VP
But this would mean I mean if

we could even get one ready this
is all we’d have for the expo

THE BEAVER
This is all we’1l need

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The Beaver is at the head of the table sitting behind his
little desk but this time it’s The VP who does the talking

He points to a cleaned up version of the beaver kit schematic
and a chart

THE VP
Replicating The Beaver as a core
item along with endless project
kits would seem to have great
appeal and taking a conservative
view of the Lego model’s numbers
we’re talking about an exponential
return

The staff looks around They’re intrigued but unsure

THE VP (CONTD
It’s risky no doubt and if we
come up short with the beaver we go
tothe expo empty handed which in
all likelihood would result in’a
failure to remain solvent

No one likes this The Beaver speaks up

THE BEAVER
Friends this is our future Do we
want to continue doing the things
that have previously resulted in
our minor success and hope that
they’re enough to survive or do we
break with the past and embrace
something new something different
something better

(MORE )

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
The question is not whether or not
this can work the question is
whether or not were bold enough to
take it on

Everyone looks around thinking considering deciding A
long beat then

QUICK CUTS
PRINTERS SPEW copies of the beaver schematics
MONITORS SHOW diagrams of the toolbox being manipulated

WORKERS MEASURE The Beaver himself to get dimensions The
Beaver nods toward The VP

THE VP nods back and then looks around as people hustle
about He looks proud

INT LIBRARY —- DAY
Porter is sitting across from a panic stricken Hector

PORTER
What the fuck do I always say
Hector Read it before you turn it
in It was about your own family
for Gods sake

HECTOR
I just figured since it was
personal there couldn’t be no test
questions on it It’s your fault
If it hadn’t been so good it won
chat award wouldn’t be no big
ea

PORTER
Your own dad turned you in

HECTOR
My grandma she was so proud she
was talking to me about all this
stuff you wrote stuff about her
and my grandad back in the war
and then all of a sudden she could
just tell I didn’t know nothing
about what she was saying And she
just starts cry ying So my dad he
call the principa said he don’t
want me to get the scholarship
Wants it to go to someone who
really respects their family
history

PORTER
Look Hector this is your problem

of it

HECTOR
Man they’re already talking about
expulsion if I don’t tell them
where it came from

PORTER
Tell them you bought it off the
internet

HECTOR

It’s a personal essay about my
family You can’t just get those on
the internet

Porter considers this for a second

PORTER
Okay I’1l make a dummy website
Paper writing for hire You give
them the web address tell them you
sent your money in got your paper
back that’ 1 you know They can
look all they want it won’t come

HECTOR
I don’t know man I feel like shit
as it is If you’d seen my grandma-

PORTER
Look I’m corny you didn’t read

trusted you and you broke the
rules so I’m counting on you to do
the right thing here

Porter sees Norah come in
PORTER (CONTD)
I gotta go I’1ll send you the fake
site address by tomorrow Okay

Porter stands to leave Hector doesn’t say anything

PORTER (CONTD)
Okay

HECTOR
Yeah Okay

Porter moves quickly over to Norah She smiles as he nears

PORTER
Hey

NORAH
Hey
PORTER
Was your coach upset

NORAH
He just told me not to miss anymore
workouts He thinks you’re a bad
influence

PORTER
I told you you didn’t have to give
me a ride

NORAH

Don’t worry about it I wanted to
PORTER

So um are you busy tonight
NORAH

Are you about to ask me out

PORTER
I’m not sure My plan was to get a
feel for the situation If it
seemed like you weren’t into it I
was just going to say that I had
worked up a beginning for the
speech and that we should get
together and make sure you think
I’m on the right track

NORAH
And if it seemed like I was into
it

PORTER
Actually I just kind of discounted
that possibi ity I think I was
going to casually ask you if you
wanted to do something without
making it sound like I’d been up
all night planning something
elaborate

NORAH
Have you been planning something
elaborate

PORTER
I have like maps and stuff

She smiles

NORAH
You can ick me up at 7 I have to
be home ¥2 And I do want to see
what you have “of the speech

PORTER
(surprised
Umokay It’s a date

Coyly as she goes
NORAH

Well see

CUT TO

INT WALTER’S BATHROOM

Walter checks the Beaver in the mirror shows its big grin
He turns The Beaver towards himself

THE BEAVER

INT WALTER’S BEDROOM

Walter emerges from the bathroom pulling on a sharp suit
jacket

THE BEAVER
Almost ready love Reservations

slip on my suit
Meredith emerges from the sloset in a stunning dress

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
Bloody hell woman Look at you

She grins walks toward him

MEREDITH
You look pretty good yourself

THE BEAVER
Oh youhaven’t seen anything yet
The girls whipped up something
special for me We’re talking full
on tux love Just give me a minute
to pop it on and we’re off

Meredith realizes that Walter is talking about dressing The
Beaver Her face loses some spark A hesitant beat

As he starts for the closet she stops him

MEREDITH
Walter come on I mean it’s our
20th anniversary

THE BEAVER
Of course dear That’s why I
thought a tux was appropriate

MEREDITH
No I mean maybe this would be a
good time to try youknow
bringing the other Walter back

THE BEAVER

Oh dear I don’t think that’s a
good idea The doctor said very-

Meredith turns serious
MEREDITH
I do not want to celebrate 20 years
of marriage with a puppet I’m
sorry but I’ve been very patient
very supportive Is it so much to
ask that you give me one night
Walter considers this He SIGHS
THE BEAVER
Compromise
INT CLASSY RESTAURANT - EVENING

Walter and Meredith step in We see that he still has The
Beaver on his hand but its not dressed and not held up

When the hostess looks up at him Walter looks nervous
unsure Then with his own voice

WALTER
Black Party of two
INT PORTER’S CAR - EVENING

Porter is driving as Norah reads some pages

NORAH
This is amazing « Really My parents
are going to flip
beat)
I don’t deserve credit for
something like this I’m just gonna
tell people you wrote it

PORTER
Trust me as long as I get a
diploma and get out of here the
credit is all yours

She looks at him

NORAH
You know if I was leaving the west
coast for Rhode Island I do
think I’d be in such a hurry

PORTER
You clearly haven’t met my family
It’s gonna be hard enough to make
it 10 more weeks without putting my
head through a wall

NORAH
What do theybeat you

PORTER
Yes With stuffed animals and
handmade furniture

NORAH
What

PORTER
Nothing

He suddenly pulls the car to stop He backs UR turns so that
the car is left facing the street He turns off the engine

PORTER (CONTD)
Well Here we are

Norah looks around It’s not a great part of town The road
is pot-holed empty dark There’s a freeway on-ramp in the
distance Other than urban decay not much to see

NORAH
Well look I appreciate your
confidence but usually if you’re
going to ‘park’ with a girly you
want to find a view with more stars
and less homeless

He twists the rear view mirror so that she can see behind
them It’s the side of an abandoned hospital building

NORAH (CONTD)
Mmmm Still not doing it for me

CUT TO

EXT PORTERS CAR

Norah beside him Porter opens the trunk revealing a nest of
various spray and regular paints

PORTER
(nervous )
Ta-da

Norah just stares at them blankly

PORTER (CONTD)
The neighborhood really isn’t as
bad as it looks According to the
web there were less that two
murders per square mile here last
year And this place got closed for
dangerous levels of asbestos so
it’s not like anyone is going to
bother us

She’s still just looking at him He pulls out some of the
paint

PORTER (CONTD)
The guy in the store was a little
suspicious so I had to get some
colors that didn’t seem like
vandalism related Can you do
graffiti in Robin’s Egg

A long beat Finally

NORAH
Porter this is sweet and all but
really I told you I wasn’t really
into any of this it was just a
stupid thing I did to get
attention

PORTER
Sure I know It just seemed like
you really had talent I hate to
see you give it up just because -

Porter suddenly realizes there’s no good way to finish that
sentence

NORAH
(almost daring him to
finish)
Just because

PORTER
Because you got in trouble once

NORAH
So this was your elaborate plan To
take me out to vandalize a building
that’s empty because it causes
cancer

PORTER
It sounds less romantic when you
say it that way

NORAH
And what did you think we would
paint Norah Porter 4ever

PORTER
I don’t know What were you
starting to paint on your brother’s
floor

Norahs face goes cold A beat and then she walks away gets
in the car closes the door Porter stands there a moment
holding cans of spray paint

INT PORTER’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Porter slowly opens and then gets into the driver’s side
They sit in silence for a moment

NORAH
You know I don’t need you to like
fix me okay

PORTER
I wasn’t trying I swear I just I
wanted to do something you’d
remember

NORAH
I think you’d rather I forget this

PORTER
Look I know I’m not stony bese your
type so I figured that m e
ot’ was to just try to be really
different

NORAH
Porter your best shot is to be
yourself

PORTER
Now see that just shows that you
don’t really know me

NORAH
I mean it was a nice thought I
guess but it’s too much You
know Just stop trying so hard
Youre already in

Porter looks up then over at her A beat as he digests this

PORTER
I am

She nods then starts to lean in ever so slightly He
hesitates Is this what it seems like

NORAH
(reading his mind)
Yes This is where you kiss me

He nods slightly moves in kisses her They wrap their arms
around one another He begins to rub her back

As he does his right hand drifts up towards her hair and
then slowly unconsciously he begins to spin a lock of it
around his index finger

Suddenly his eyes pop wide open and he jerks away as if he’s
been shocked

NORAH (CONTD)
What What

PORTER
That thing That thing I just did

NORAH
What did you do

PORTER
With your hair

He angrily hits himself in the head a few times As he
oes

PORTER (CONTD)
That’s new That’s a new one

NORAH
Porter Porter you’re kinda
freaking me out

Porter puts his head in his hands

PORTER
That’s 58

NORAH
What are you talking about

He looks like he wants to explain but can’t find the words

Norah is totally lost Her face says she’s decided this was
all a big mistake She’s about to say so when her phone
rings She looks at it picks it up

NORAH (CONTD)
(bright)
Hey mom

Disgusted with himself Porter gets out of the car walks
away Norah makes a motion like ‘where are you going’ but
he’s gone She stays on the phone

NORAH (CONTD)

No we’re still studying Just
getting back to the library Um
okays I guess Actually we might

ack early Yeah We don’t have
as much to go over as I thought
Okay Yeah I’1ll call you Love
you Bye

Norah hangs up She SIGHS She takes a long beat deciding
what she wants to do next

EXT PORTER’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Norah opens her door gets out When she turns she sees Porter
standing by the side of the building In Robin’s Egg he’s
written

FOR AN AWKWARD TIME CALL PORTER BLACK

She can’t help but smile She walks toward him They both
stare at the wall

NORAH
I know youre new at this but you
usually want to avoid using your
full name

A beat
PORTER
I’m sorry
NORAH
What was that back there

Porter shakes his head He looks at the rubber band on his
wrist Toys with it

PORTER
How may little ways do you think
two things can be alike before you
have to start worrying about the
big ones

She has no idea what to say to this He turns to her

PORTER (CONTD
This is like the worst first date
ever isn’t it

NORAH
Yes

She takes the spray can out of his hand

NORAH (CONTD)
So far

She walks up and starts to paint out his name

NORAH (CONT D)
Were going to cover this up and
then you re going to buy me
something to eat in part of town
where no one was murdered this week
and then I’1ll get back to you
Deal

Porter is about to answer when suddenly a spotlight hits
them

They turn to see a police car idling in the street A long
beat then

The police car flips on its red and blue lights

INT CLASSY RESTAURANT

Walter and Meredith are eating It’s silent Awkward Walter
keeps The Beaver in his lap He looks nervous

The WAITER steps over

WAITER
How is everything

Walter looks at Meredith He nods

MEREDITH
Excellent Thanks
(beat)
You know now might be a good time
for the

WAITER
Yes ma’am

The waiter departs Meredith smiles at Walter SILENCE

MEREDITH
I was listening to the radio
Apparently it’s supposed to be
really hot this weekend Well not
really hot but hot Above average

Walter nods They’ve been reduced to talking about the
weather

MEREDITH (CONTD)
How’s work Are you making the
schedule

WALTER
It’s good
(beat)
Busy

Now Meredith nods Walter’s face says he’s trying He doesn’t
look depressed More deer in the headlights SILENCE

The waiter returns and places a wrapped gift on the table

MEREDITH
Thank you

She pushes it across to Walter

MEREDITH (CONTD)
Go ahead

He reaches out to unwrap it using his free hand and The
Beaver Inside is a memory box similar to the first one we
saw but significantly more ornate

WALTER
It’s very nice Thank you

MEREDITH
Henry helped me Which means I
bought the wood and Henry made it
(beat
Look inside

He opens the box It’s full of old photos

ANGLE ON the photos They’re all shots Walter and Meredith in
younger happier times

MEREDITH (CONTD)
I was looking through some things
I just thought it’s important to
remind ourselves you know how it
was How it should

He flips through Shots of them smiling laughing holding
babies Shots of them in Halloween costumes at Christmas
parties on vacation Him with her on his shoulders

As he looks Walter starts to tear up and CRY For a moment
it’s just a quiet sentimental WEEP But it quickly expands
into a more hiccupy-breakdown-SOB

Other diners stare

MEREDITH (CONTD)
Walter Walter it’s okay Hon
look at me Walter

But he’s inconsolable He just keeps staring at the last
photo her on his shoulders both of them laughing

He’s worked up a solid cry now Everyone is staring
Suddenly

He raises The Beaver Just the act of doing so helps him
choke back the tears He lets it take over

THE BEAVER
Is this what you want Is this
progress Christ woman he’s
suffering from de ression not
amnesia You think the problem is
that he just doesn’t remember these
things Remembering has nothing to
do with it He can remember what it
was like to play little league
That doesn’t mean he can go sign up
for a team

The sight of The Beaver has the other diners really locked
in Meredith is mortified

THE BEAVER (CONTD)

He can’t go back Don’t you see
that This is all in the past and
dredging it up we all know where
this leads We know where Walter
oes You want the rest of your

ife to be like tonight That’s
Walter That’s the best he can do
He’s not going back to that

Suddenly she doesn’t care who’s watching

MEREDITH
What does that mean

Her cell phone is RINGING on the table
THE BEAVER
It means we’ve turned over a new
leaf We’ve got a fresh start We-

She’s not planning to answer but when she sees the name she
picks up immediately

MEREDITH
Porter

CUT TO

INT POLICE STATION

Porter and Norah sit in chairs against a wall She’s CRYING
He tries to console her She jerks away

NEW ANGLE reveals NORAH’S MOM AND DAD marching up to them
They stare down at Norah

NORAHS DAD
I don’t even know what to say Id
hoped we were past this sort of
thing

He doesn’t sound upset but numb But for Norah this is
worse A long beat

PORTER
Sir this is a big
misunderstanding It was completely
my-

NORAHS DAD
Let’s go

Norah gets UR walks away with them Porter keeps watching
hoping she’1ll at least look back but she doesn’t

PORTER
Norah Norah I’m sorry

Norah’s mom gives him a glare but Norah never turns

As Norahs family nears the front Walter and Meredith come
in Porter can’t hear but he sees Walter raise The Beaver
and start talking to the SERGEANT at the front

Norahs dad overhears this He stops asks a question Then
The Beaver and Norah’s father get into a conversation with
Walter pointing in Porter’s direction

Norah’s father looks at Walter like he’s crazy He starts to
walk away

Norah and Porters eyes finally meet Her look is not
sympathetic It’s like she doesn’t even know him

And then she’s gone

Porter drops his head begins to POUND it against the cinder
block wall As he goes in for another shot

MATCH CUT TO

INT PORTER’S BEDROOM

Porter pounding his head into his own wall

EXT PORTER’S BEDROOM

We hear the THUDS as the stucco breaks away Porters
actually breaking out Through a tiny hole we can actually
see in

Suddenly his eyes appears in the hole looking out

PUSH IN on the hole as his eye disappears and then his head
comes back for another blow causing more stuccos to break
loose and the hole to widen ever so slightly

Another blown and then suddenly his head disappears followed
by the faint sound of him collapsing unconscious

We hold on the hole looking into the room from outside

FADE TO BLACK

INT SUBURBAN - AFTERNOON
Meredith waits outside the school Henry opens his door
leaps in But when the back doors open Meredith stops the
other kids cold
MEREDITH

They stop mid entry back out close the doors She looks at
Henry He doesn’t seem to havé noticed any of it

INT GARAGE

Henry is working Meredith opens the door A moment as she
considers things

MEREDITH
That’s enough for today

HENRY

He thinks about protesting but gives up He puts his stuff
down walks inside

The way he moves quiet uncaring he’s instantly back to
being the old Henry Meredith looks distraught

PORTER
Norah listen-

She sees some other squad girls and joins up with them
blends in disappears
INT KITCHEN

Walter enters from the garage Meredith is waiting at the
table His original card is the only thing in front of her

THE BEAVER
Hello Love

Meredith doesn’t say anything She just stares at him
She looks

She picks

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
What’s the trouble

at the card

MEREDITH

Walter he says you haven’t been
there in almost a year

THE BEAVER
Well that’s I-

up the card

MEREDITH
What is this What are you doing

Walter says nothing

MEREDITH (CONTD)
Dr Macy says youre sick Walter
Very sick He said that this sounds
like some kind of mania He says-

THE BEAVER
Dr Macy Dr Macy Who gives a
damn what Dr Macy says Why don’t
we go down to the office and see
what they sa Meredith Let’s see
if they think were sick yeah Or
let’s see if they think maybe
Walter is better than he’s ever
been Let’s ask Henry what he
thinks Let’s ask Henry if he feels
better about himself when I’m
around if he’s made any new
friends if he’s happier since I
showed up Ask yourself Meredith
Ask yourself if you can remember
how things were See if you can
remember the person you threw out
of here and then tell us why you re
so worried about getting him back

MEREDITH
So what are you saying W Walter you
just want to live like this
forever Walking around with a
beaver puppet on your hand

THE BEAVER
What would be so wrong with that
I’d say it’s been a pretty smashing
success so far

Meredith is stunned She just shakes her head

MEREDITH
Walter you need help

THE BEAVER
Help help help Everybody wants
him to get help See the expert

Read the book Take the pill Well
Walter finall helped himself You
understand That’s what I’m here
for He doesn’t need anyone else

MEREDITH

Walter listen to yourself This is
insane You’re talking about a
fucking puppet

THE BEAVER
No youre talking about a puppet
We’re talking about a success

She looks at him heartbroken

MEREDITH
Who is ‘we’ Walter

Off his look

INT BATHROOM

Walter splashes water on his face with his free hand He
stands up and looks himself in the mirror

Slowly he raises his left hand until he and The Beaver are
both staring into the mirror

THE BEAVER

I know it’s hard mate but you
can’t let yourself get mixed up
You’ve done what you needed to
You’ve put the past behind you
You’re moving on and we’re doing

reat She’s the one who’s got to

et go And if she can’t then
youve got to let her go

Walter looks troubled by this suggestion

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
I know I know but trust me it’s
for the best What we talked about
blowing it up starting fresh a
clean slate well this is what it
takes Anything less and we’re back
on the road to that hotel room Is
that what you want

Walter shakes his head

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
Youre free mate You’ve broken
out All you have to do now is keep
moving Keep moving and never look
back If it’s meant to be they’1ll
follow But that’s up to them It’s
out of our hands

Walter stares at The Beaver for a long beat Finally he
makes the slightest of nods

INT WALTER’S BEDROOM
Walter steps in Meredith is sitting on the bed She looks
up

THE BEAVER
Understand that we love you more
than anything But you’re the one
who needs help This notion of what
used to be it poisons everything
and until you realize that and let
it go it’s just going to continue
to make you miserable We’ve put it
behind us and we’re not looking
back We hope you can do the same
But make no mistakes I’m not going
anywhere

Meredith stares at him SILENCE She gets UP slowly walks
over looks into Walter’s eyes She kisses him on the cheek

PORTER SWEEPS books into a box He pauses over the notebook
labeled JOURNAL OF SIMILARITIES we saw in the beginning

NEW ANGLE shows the list now numbers in the low 60s

INT GARAGE

Henry is loading pieces of wood into the back of the suburban
when his mother comes out with bags She looks at him He
looks at her She can’t bear to tell him no

Porter comes out tosses his things in Without a word he
gets in the passenger seat puts on his belt He’s ready

As Meredith and Henry are finishing up Walter steps into the
garage He stands by the door

Henry rushes over to him

HENRY
Why aren’t you coming with us

THE BEAVER
Another time mate Another time

HENRY
But I want to stay with you

Walter and Meredith exchange glances These words clearly
break her heart

THE BEAVER
You go with your mum we’ll get it
all sorted yeah You’1ll see
everything will be good again real
soon

MEREDITH
Henry It’s time to go

He turns and walks to the car the same distant emotionless
walk he’s shown us before Meredith gets in Henry climbs in
She starts the car

Then just as she’s about to back out Henry leaps out runs
to Walter He throws himself around him tears streaking down
his face

HENRY
I love you Dad

This hits Walter someplace deep He’s moved to the verge of
tears himself He has to swallow hard to get words out and
when he does the accent is shaky Still it’s The Beaver who
does the talking

THE BEAVER
I love you too mate I love you
too

Finally Henry releases him The Beaver reaches down musses
Henry’s hair Henry turns runs back to the car

Once he’s in Meredith puts it in gear She pauses a second
she and Walter sharing a final glance

Her expression says she can’t believe he’s really just
watching them go It’s a pleading glance

But then like that it hardens He wants her to let go of
the past that’s exactly what she’s about to do She turns
around watching the driveway as she backs out

The suburban hits the street turns and it’s gone As soon
as it clears frame the garage door starts to come down

Walter watches it until it noisily closes Then SILENCE

Walter looks at the dining room table empty except for his
original card

CUT TO

INT HENRY’S ROOM

Walter stands looking at all the projects both finished and
abandoned Everything is made of wood

There are coffee tables stacked three high Rocking chairs
The very beginning of what might have become a boat hull

He picks up a small item near the wall It’s a beaver figure
like the one Walter roughed out and took to work but much
more polished refined

spilling out He can see the top of the one with Meredith on

EXT PORTER’S BEDROOM

From outside we look through the hole and see Walter staring
back at us

As we start to pull back he walks closer until it looks like
he’1l lean down and put his face to the hole

Instead he reaches Porter’s bed and simply falls onto it

As he disappears from frame we’re left looking into Porter’s
empty room until the camera pulls back and the hole becomes
just a pinprick of light in the wall

And then the lights go out

EXT BIG BOX STORE

A REPORTER is on mic a small queue of people in line to
enter the store behind her

REPORTER
Christmas in May That’s what
some retailers” are calling it with
Mr Beaver Woodchopper kits selling
out in numbers that remind many of
the Tickle Me Elmo phenomenon
Davyco the company behind Mr
Beaver says they’re doing all they
can to keep pace with demand but
admits there have been shortages
tnterestingly you may recall that
Davyco which had earlier success
with 90’s fads Action Jack and
Princess Stephanie lost its
founder and CEO Davy Conyers ina
highly publicized restaurant
choking incident while in the
company of a paid escort and since
then the company has been in steep
decline hovering on the verge of
bankruptcy earlier this year But
thanks to Mr Beaver it looks like
that won’t be happening anytime
soon

INT WALTER’S OFFICE - EVENING

Walter flips off the TV as the report ends He turns to The
VP who’s sitting across from him holding a snifter of brandy

Their voices indicate that they’re a bit on the tipsy side

THE VP
It’s like a hundred million dollar
ad campaign for free

They both LAUGH The VP takes a sip of his brandy

We see that Walter also has a snifter It has two straws He
puts one to his lips one to the Beavers and drinks

The VP shifts in his seat

THE VP (CONTD)
Speaking of we’ve been getting a
lot of media requests for you
We’ve been declining obviously but
if we set up a big conference call
we could milk the PR a little
without really exposing too much

THE BEAVER

Conference call Don’t be
ridiculous mate Who’s the biggest
request we’ve had

THE VP
I don’t know All the morning
shows CNN CNBC

THE BEAVER
Today show then Set it up

THE VP
Sir the Today show is on
television

THE BEAVER

Why are you acting like we’ve got
something to hide mate The case
is just the opposite We’ve got a
story not just about the rebirth
of a company but of a man That’s
a powerful tale and we should be
looking to tell it wherever they’1l

listen
THE VP
It’s just hard to predict how
people are going to react
THE BEAVER

How did you react

THE VP
Well I was pretty shocked at
first
THE BEAVER
Of course you were But I’ve
convinced you it’s for the best
have I not And the rest of the
staff How many people have we
lost

THE VP
None

THE BEAVER
So what makes you think I can’t
convince them

The VP thinks this over

THE VP
It would certainly be a story

THE BEAVER
Damn right And who better to tell
it

The VP nods He’s coming around on this A beat

THE VP
I have to tell you in the
beginning I think a lot of us
thought this was the beginning of
the end

They LAUGH

THE VP (CONTD)
I don’t know how you did it but-

He raises his glass Walter reciprocates CLINK

THE VP (CONTD)
I’m damn glad you did and frankly
proud to have been part of it

They both take a drink A quiet stillness settles They
regard one another for a moment Then

THE BEAVER
I’m going to tell you something
Something I haven’t told anyone
else But it’s something that I
think you’re ready to hear

The VP looks honored to be entrusted

THE VP
Okay
THE BEAVER
The truth is I’m not a puppet

The VP smiles waiting for the punch line

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
I’m afraid I’m quite serious mate
I’m as real as you or Walter

The VP is struggling still hoping this is a joke He feels
obligated to say something

THE VP
I don’t understand

THE BEAVER
Well imagine Siamese Twins but
instead of being cut apart we’ve
been put back together You see
We’re a part of a system something
that’s full integrated shared
He’s part of me and I’m literally a
part of him We make one another
whole And now that that’s
happened now that we’ve been
joined we couldn’t be separated if
we wanted to

The VP has given up waiting for the other shoe He just looks
uncomfortab
THE VP
I see
THE BEAVER

I understand believe me it’s hard
to swallow Neither of us has the
slightest clue how it happened It
would appear that when I breathed
life into him he breathed life
into me I suppose I just wanted
you to know it’s not an act it’s
not a gimmick it’s not a stunt
I’m real alive fused And that’s
not going to change It’s not going
to be undone

The VP nods

A long beat

4d

HE VP
Okay

THE BEAVER
You don’t believe me

THE VP

It’s not that sir it’s just
very strange I’m sure you
believe-

THE BEAVER
Pull me off

THE VP
Excuse me

THE BEAVER
Come up here and pull me off of
Walter’s hand

THE VP
That’s really not necessary sir
If you say-

THE BEAVER
Come up here and pull me off his
goddamned hand

The VP sits stunned for a moment Finally he puts down his
snifter moves to the desk He’s struck by the size of
Walter’s bulging left forearm

He looks at Walter for a beat then puts his hands on The
Beaver He makes the faintest of tugging motions

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
Oh come on Pull

The VP sighs This time he pulls a little harder The Beaver
doesn’t budge

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
Come on dammit Stop being a pussy
PULL

Now this is getting on the VP’s nerves This time he yanks
Still nothing

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
That’s the way Come on

Suddenly the VP wants to prove to Walter that he’s
delusional He really gets into it

He leans back he GRUNTS Nothing

He changes his grip puts a foot on the desk to brace
himself He STRAINS

THE VP
(as he pulls)
Jesus What did you glue this
thing

THE BEAVER
(calm)
Not a glue on Earth that can do
this mate That’s what I’ve been
telling you

The VP manages to pull Walter a few inches out of his chair
but The Beaver doesn’t move at all

Now he’s frustrated maybe a little creeped out He begins to
grab The Beaver every which way as he struggles to pull it
off like a dog with a sock in Yes mouth

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
Hey Hey not my nose dammit Let
go of my arm you asshole
Finally when he’s applied all his effort something lets go
and the VP flies backward across the office and into the wall
where he collapses

He looks at his hands Nothing but a couple tiny tufts of
fur

He looks across the office There’s Walter and The Beaver as
connected as ever He hasn’t moved it a fraction

The VP has no idea what to think He’s simply dumbfounded

Walter gets up from behind the desk walks over to him He
extends his right hand helps the VP up

An awkward SILENCE when the three of them are face to face

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
You okay to drive

THE VP
(beat)
Yes sir

4d

HE BEAVER
Good

The VP nods He turns to go

THE BEAVER foons ) D)
Don’t forget mate Today show Set

The VP hesitates He nods again And he’s gone
When he’s alone Walter and The Beaver slowly turn face each
other Off their stare down
INT SCHOOL CAFETERIA - LUNCH

Porter slides next to Norah as she’s selecting food

PORTER
Hey We need to talk

NORAH
Now’s not a good time
PORTER
Yeah well I’ve called texted
im’d and it never seems to be a
good time

NORAH
Maybe you should take that as a
hint

As she walks away towards the registers

PORTER
I read an article about your
brother

She stops Turns Waits

PORTER (CONTD)
He really was an amazing guy

NORAH
That’s what you wanted to tell me

PORTER
You said you’d been headed to
Stanford forever You never said
that’s where he was planning on
going too

NORAH
So we’re going to the same school
Big deal

PORTER

Please The same school The same
classes The same clubs If they’d
let you on the football team youd
have identical transcripts

She heads for the registers again He follows

PORTER (CONTD)
Look I understand that you feel a
certain res onsibility for what
happened But it’s not your job to
replace him

As she’s paying

NORAH
You don’t have a fucking clue what
you’re talking about

PORTER
All I’m saying is if you don’t want
to see me you don’t want to talk
to me that’s fine But do it
because that’s really what you want
to do not because you think it’s
what you’re supposed to do

NORAH
Where did you get this idea that
I’m not doing what I want

PORTER
Oh come on One day youre this
rebel painter and then your brother
dies and suddenly you’re making a
beeline for valedictorian and
Stanford

NORAH
It’s called growing up You should
try it

She takes her food walks away He falls right into step

PORTER

It’s called denial Norah Youguys
keep his room hermetically sealed
while you build a carbon copy right
next door You feel guilty so you
drop your own life and try to take
over - And as long as you never
step out of the footprints
everyone gets to go on pretending
it never happened But you meet
somebody and you threaten to live
your own life even for a second
and you freak out I’m sorry about
what happened I don’t know how
Many More ways I can say that but
I’m not your problem Norah Your
problem is that you have no idea
who you really are and you don’t
seem the least bit interested in
finding out You can take all his
classes and give his speeches and
go get his degree if you want but
sooner or later you and your
parents are gonna have to face the

act that none of that is going to
bring your brother back

She stops suddenl turns and SLAPS him Hard Drops her tray
and puts him on t é ground hard

The whole room looks up People stand crowd in Some OHHS
Theyre all waiting

She looks down at him She’s teary eyed but her voice is
pure anger

NORAH
You want to hear from the real me
Fuck off

She walks away and is immediately embraced by the squad
Porter just sits there until people lose interest move on

He SNAPS the rubber band on his wrist

INT TODAY SHOW STUDIO

ANGLE ON The VP standing by a monitor watching the back and
forth between MATT LAUER and The Beaver

The VP looks like he’s nervous enough to gnaw off a finger

MATT LAUER
And so what was their reaction the
first time you showed up for work
like this

THE BEAVER
Well I’m sure they thought I was
crazy And justifiably so
NEW ANGLE shows Matt and Walter on the actual set

THE BEAVER (CONTD)
Wouldn’t you

MATT LAUER
But that’s not how you saw
yourself

THE BEAVER

Not at all Mozart was said to
occasionally feel obliged to meow
like a cat but he seemed to get on
all right Walter’s approach was
unconventional because conventional
approaches proved worthless What’s
important is not how someone looks
or speaks but what results from
their actions and words I think
the overwhelming success of what
was recently a failing company says
all it needs to about Walter’s
judgement

MATT LAUER
And this all began as a way of
dealing with depression

THE BEAVER
Sometimes Matt we reach a point
where in order to go on we have to
wipe the slate clean Put the
problems failures and fear of the
past behind us and begin again from
scratch

MATT LAUER
Well I think the obvious question
is why would you choose this
particular way to attack that
problem

THE BEAVER

Because sometimes the thing that’s
holding you back is the very idea
of who you are We begin our lives
believing that anything is possible
and then slowly we let the walls
close in until all we can see is
this very narrow range of
possibilities We say things like
‘oh I’m not the kind of person who
could do this or that who could
look this way or that way who
could say these things or those
We start to see who we are as a box
that we’re trapped inside and
however we try to escape
resolutions therapy drugs
classes it simply reels us back
in And I believe the only way to
truly break out is to get rid of
that box all together If thinking
and acting and being a certain way
a certain ‘person’ has resulted in
unhappiness why would you keep
doing it Taking your future into
your hands and starting over isn’t
crazy Crazy is being miserable and
still doing the same things day
after day Walter had made a mess
of his life and until he freed
himself from his failures he was
cut off from the potential for the
wonderful things you see happening
to him now And I’d suggest to you
that there are many others out
there being crushed under the
weight of the boxes they’ve put
themselves in And whether those
Beside pick up a puppet or not is

eside the point What’s important
is that they find a way to start
over from a point where they really
and truly believe that anything is
possible Because it’s been my
experience that if you can do that
what follows will only confirm the
notion

Matt thinks on this for a moment He seems surprised

NEW ANGLE shows the VP watching stunned

MATT LAUER
(on monitor)
Well I want thank you for joining
us this morning

The VP can’t believe they’ve pulled it off He looks elated

DAYTIME TALK SHOW HOST

T
whi1d wr we sdandby the message we
were trying to communicate it’s
clear that the messenger was not
well and I want to make clear that
we do not endorse any of the
tactics he may have discussed here
or elsewhere If anyone feels like
the might hurt themselves please
call-

ANGLE ON the couch revealing Porter sprawled barely
conscious He changes the channel

Meredith walks in She stands in front of the TV Turns it
off He doesn’t seem to notice

MEREDITH
Come on Get up

He doesn’t budge

MEREDITH (CONTD)

You don’t have to go in if

don’t want to but I’m not eaving
you here to sleep all day

She walks over starts to physically pull him up He remains
limp

PORTER
Mom

She drops him He goes horizontal again She looks
exasperated

MEREDITH
Porter please

A long beat He slowly gets to his feet He raises his arms
as if to say happy

MEREDITH (CONTD)
Good Get some shoes on

PORTER
I’m up okay But I’m not going

She looks at him Considers this Henry comes in excited

HENRY
Are we going

A beat She decides Porter is a lost cause

MEREDITH
Yeah

Henry takes off toward the garage Meredith looks at Porter
one more time

MEREDITH (CONTD)

Do something Go outside Take a

walk See that girl Steal a car I

don’t care Just get out of the

house okay
He nods She heads for the garage
Porter stands still as we hear the Suburban rumble away Then
he heads for the stairs
INT PORTER’S BEDROOM
Porter walks in He heads straight for his bed falls into
it pulls a pillow over his hea

INT PSYCH HOSPITAL

Walter wearing hospital issue white is seated across from
DOCTOR BANKS They’re working with a prosthetic hand

Walter raises it looks at it He seems pleased The doctor
seems pleased

INT PSYCH HOSPITAL - LATER

Walter is in group surrounded by other patients in white
each with varying grips on reality DOCTOR BANKS is at the
center of the semi-circle

Walter raises his prosthetic to talk Before he’s called on
NURSE enters

NURSE
Walter Family’s here

Walter beams

INT PSYCH HOSPITAL - CAFETERIA

Walter sits across the table from Meredith and Henry Henry
passes across a gift bag

Walter looks at it surprised He opens it up He pulls out
small hand-carved replica of a brain

HENRY
Mom says yours got broken

Walter LAUGHS

WALTER
Thank you very much This will come
in handy
A beat
HENRY

So are you crazy
Meredith begins to protest but Walter’s up to it

WALTER
Maybe But we’re working on it

HENRY
Does that mean you can come home

He and Meredith share a glance

WALTER
Were working on it

A beat

MEREDITH
They said you’re doing well

WALTER
Eat sleep talk don’t hurt
yourself Not the toughest gig

Despite the circumstances Walter seems relatively upbeat
together

WALTER (CONTD)
How’s Porter

Meredith rolls her eyes

MEREDITH
He won’t do anything I’m trying to
et him to take community college
or a year but he won’t even talk
about it He just lays there

Walter nods considering this deeply

MEREDITH (CONTD)
He’s got to do something We can’t
go a year like this

WALTER
Sounds like he was too busy to come
along

She suddenly finds herself staring at the prosthetic hand

MEREDITH
He’s just he’1ll come around

Walter nods A long silence Walter begins to run his hand
over the contours of the brain They all find themselves
staring at it

INT PSYCH HOSPITAL - LATER

Henry and Walter hug goodbye - Meredith and Walter follow
suit He’s escorted through a door waves goodbye

As Meredith and Henry walk away a Doctor falls into step

DOCTOR BANKS
Mrs Black I’m Doctor Banks We
spoke on the phone

She nods but doesn’t stop walking

DOCTOR BANKS (CONTD)
Well as I said we’re very pleased
with Walters progress He’s on
medication but we’ve got the
dosing at a low level and he’s
responded very favorably No signs
of delirium or suicidal ideation
And he’s been very active in group
and with the other patients
Frankly he’s well liked

Meredith nods but she’s still walking If anything she’s
walking faster
DOCTOR BANKS (CONTD)
As I said on the phone I think
that with some supervision and
regular therapy there’s no reason-

They reach the doors Meredith cuts him off pulls out
keys She hands them to Henry

MEREDITH
Henry Here Go wait in the car
Ill just be another minute

Henry looks at her takes the keys walks out
Meredith turns back to the doctor

DOCTOR BANKS
As I was saying I’m comfortable
releasing him to your care if-

MEREDITH
Doctor I’m I don’t think we’re
ready for that

The doctor nods takes this in

DOCTOR BANKS
I understand When you are ready I
think it would be beneficial for
him to have his family around him

She thinks it over

MEREDITH
How long will you keep him

DOCTOR BANKS
Well it would be several months
before we could sign him out under
his own supervision but-

MEREDITH
That’s fine We’ll work on figuring
out what to do with him after that

her

A beat as he grasps the situation He hands her some papers

DOCTOR BANKS
In case you change your mind

She takes the papers puts them in her purse She heads out

INT PSYCH HOSPITAL

Walter is seated on a couch with other patients facing a TV

but Walter’s eyes are on the window

ANGLE ON the window where he can see Meredith getting into
the suburban She backs up drives on

ANGLE ON Walter as he raises his prosthetic hand regards it

FADE TO BLACK

OVER BLACK

A DOORBELL rings

INT FOYER

Meredith opens the door to reveal Norah They look at one
another

CUT TO

INT HALLWAY

Meredith KNOCKS on Porter’s door No response She tries the
handle It’s locked

MEREDITH
Porter Porter are you up Your
friend is here Norah
A long beat Then suddenly the sound of his radio BLARING

Meredith turns to Norah Norah smiles She understands

INT PORTER’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Porter sits on his bed staring at the door He’s clearly
conflicted but he doesn’t move

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Meredith and Norah are walking away when suddenly the music
stops Norah and Meredith pause look back Porter’s door

opens He sticks his head out

A long beat as Norah and Porter look at one another Then
without a word she turns and heads back towards his room

Meredith watches satisfied then heads downstairs

INT PORTER’S BEDROOM

Porter sits on his bed Norah sits across There’s a bit of a
breeze outside and even though the poster is once again over
the hole in the wall it RATTLES occasionally as the wind
comes through the small opening to the outside

They can’t seem to decide who should start Finally

PORTER
So how was graduation

NORAH
Honestly Id say the fact that you
weren’t allowed to be there worked
out in your favor

He just nods

NORAH (CONTD)
I wanted you to know I didn’t end
up using your speech At the last
minute I got this idea that it was
more important for the words to be
mine than to be good

A beat Then quietly

PORTER
Well you still owe me 150 bucks

She smiles the first break in the ice

NORAH
You were right you know About no
one really paying attention When I
finally decided that I had to write
the thing myself I thought I
suddenly had this great insight
that was going to knock everyone’s
socks off It was all about how
every time you breathe you get two
atoms that were breathed by every
person who’s ever lived Julius
Caesar James Dean Queen
Elizabeth You’ve heard that right

He nods

NORAH (CONTD)
So anyway that meant that two of
the atoms in everyone’s breath also
came from my brother And even
though he was gone he was still
this tiny part of us all

(MORE )
A beat

NORAH (CONTD)
And what he’d want us to remember
was not that his name was on two
atoms in every breath but that
every breath was our chance to put
our own signature on a trillion
little pieces of the future

PORTER
Not bad

NORAH
Yeah Well let me give you some
advice should you ever find
yourself giving a speech to a
thousand eighteen year olds dying
to oO party Dead people and atoms
a

Pro y not the topics you want to
lead with

PORTER
No

NORAH

I mean I can’t tell you how many
times I pictured all of that
playing out you know Me on stage
giving this amazing speech
everyone in awe my parents
weeping and even my brother like
sittingon some cloud looking down
and smiling

(beat)
But it wasn’t like that at all I
mean people clapped but mostly
because it was over Durban the
third time’s the charm senior he
got the real ovation

PORTER
And your parents

NORAH
Oh very happy Very proud We have
roughly 4000 photos of the event

PORTER
And your brother

NORAH
Not a cloud in the sky

Porter nods

NORAH (CONTD)
I know you think that I’ve been
trying to replace him somehow and
I’m sure that’s part of it but the
truth is I didn’t know him that
well when he was alive

(MORE)

NORAH (CONTD)

He was always something I was

trying to separate myself from not

oser to And by the time I

Zealized how stupid that was he
wasn’t around So I didn’t become
this overachieving valedictorian to
bring him back I did it because
every time I did something hed
done every time someone looked at
me and saw a little bit of my
brother it felt like we were
getting closer Like I was finally
getting to know him even though he
was gone But the flip side is that
after eighteen years I feel like I
know my dead brother a lot better
than I know myself And I guess I
just wanted to say I’m working
on it

A beat then she stands

NORAH (CONTD)
Anyway I should go We’re doing
some packing

PORTER
(as he stands)
Really dying to get to Stanford
uh

NORAH
Well no actually It’s not that
kind of packing I ended up
deferring Stanford for a year I
figured I’d take some time drive
around see if that’s really where
I’m supposed to be Or something
Tike t at Like I said I’m working
on it

Porter’s surprised

PORTER
Wow Good for you How are your
parents with that

NORAH
(beat )
We’re all working on it

She starts to go and then stops reaches into her purse and
pulls out some papers

NORAH (CONTD)
Oh I almost forgot I wanted to
give you this
He takes the pages

PORTER
What is it

NORAH
It’s your speech

PORTER
Oh Well this is just a print out
Ive still got it on my drive

NORAH
I know I just thought I mean I
know your whole deal was that you
could sound like anyone but t
more I thought about it the more I
realized this isn’t me talking
It’s you You wrote it I just
wondered if you’d ever really sat
down and read it

He’s not sure what to say She looks at him smiles She
hesitates then steps over kisses him It’s short sweet
but it says what it needs to

She walks out He looks at the pages in his hand The wind
RATTLES the poster on his wall

He takes a seat on his bed unfolds the pages As he begins
to read

PORTER (VO)
Faculty students families I’m
here today because I’m supposed to
tell you something about tomorrow
Im SUPP posed to remind you that
it’s the first day of the rest of
your life and inspire you to seize
the infinite array of possibilities
that have suddenly become
available I’m supposed to tell you
that you can do anything you dare
to dream as long as you just listen
to your heart and follow your
rainbow But I can’t do that
Because it’s not true

CUT TO

INT NORAHS BROTHER’S ROOM
We see the walls covered in trophies awards

NEW ANGLE reveals that Norah and her parents are packing the
things into boxes

PORTER (VO)
The truth is there Ste people out
there in big government buildings
and insurance agencies whose job is
to predict the future They don’t
know you or me don’t know a thing
about our hopes and dreams and
frankly they don’t care

(MORE )

PORTER (VO) (CONTD)
But still they’re hunched over
their computers crunching numbers
and without ever having asked you
what bee want to be when you grow
up ey know not only what kind of
job Yoo 11 have and how much money
youll make but whether you’1ll be
married or have kids where and how
youll live and even roughly when
youll die

CUT TO

INT PSYCH HOSPITAL

We see Walter in the ward He’s playing a game with other
patients They LAUGH

PORTER (VO)

And when you look at all their
statistics all their data all
their predictions the future looks
less like something you get to
write than something you simply get
to show up for

CUT TO

INT PSYCH HOSPITAL

We see Meredith and Walter visiting together It’s tender
quiet They hold hands

PORTER (VO
So instead of deluding you instead
of offering you cliches and
platitudes I’m just going to give
it to you Straight Most of us will
be average That’s why they call it
average because the majority of us
end up there And according to the
statistics this is what the future
holds for the average person in
this class You’1ll die before
youre 85

CUT TO

INT PSYCH HOSPITAL

Meredith stands talking to the doctor at the door again
Again she leaves alone

PORTER (VO)

You’1l be married but you’1l also
et divorced You’ll suffer from at
east one major medical problem

(MORE )

PORTER (VO) (CONTD)
You’11 work out of an office live
in a modest home and never make
more than 100 thousand dollars a
year Doesn’t really sound that
exciting does it Certainly doesn’t
sound like the life they promise in
most graduation speeches

CUT TO

INT GARAGE

Henry is happily back at work surrounded by lumber if not
people

PORTER (VO)
But what if I told you that the
person described in that scenario
was not someone from this class
but Albert Einstein Because while
he may have been one of the most
famous minds in history according
to the numbers he was as average
38 they come Life he down eke job

pay house all right down the

dle So how come average is

probably the last thing you think
of when you hear the name Einstein

CUT TO

INT NORAH’S ROOM
Norah is packing her own things

PORTER (VO

It’s because even if all the
statistics all the predictions
all the numbers are true they
don’t really tell you anything
about what your life wil ike
What it will be worth What it will
mean The formulas equations
scores and data they’re just
pieces of the story

CUT TO

EXT NORAHS DRIVEWAY
We see her and her parents loading her car up with her stuff

PORTER (VO)
And if you put them all together
they don’t really tell you who
you on be because people are more
han the sum of their parts
(MORE )
PORTER

(V0)

(CONTD)

I can’t stand here and tell you

that an

nything is possible because

ANGLE ON all his books on genetics

NEW ANGLE shows him packing them up He rests on a box
looking down toying with the rubber band on his wrist He
eyes his Journal of Similarities list

PORTER (VO)
Your name is already written in a

book somewhere

things whether you like them or

not have already been

next to it And maybe those things

jotted down

can’t be changed But what your
name will ultimate

It’s something that

only you can

Walter nods shrugs
WALTER

Walter smiles

WALTER
They’ re just doctors son They
can’t see the future

PORTER
But they have agood feeling
right They feel like you’re
probably going to be okay

WALTER
It’s not up to them

A long beat Porter works up to asking the question he really
wants the answer to

PORTER
What about me Am I going to be
okay
Declarative and without hesitation

WALTER
You’re going to be fine

Porter scoffs

PORTER
First Grandpa and now you I mean-

Again definitively

WALTER
You’re going to be fine

Porter’s tone changes He’s not combative He really wants
the answer

PORTER
How do you know that

Walter waits until Porter looks him in the eye

WALTER
Because it’s up to you

Another long beat Then

Porter reaches down pulls the rubber band off his wrist He
puts it around his father’s prosthetic

They look at one another

CUT TO

INT SUBURBAN - DAY

Porter gets into the back seat closes the door He’s
emotional unsure what he’s feeling

on a piece of wood Finally

HENRY

PORTER
Yeah Just have to finish some

paperwork

EXT PSYCH HOSPITAL
The front door opens Meredith and Walter come out together

Walter takes a moment to look around and then out of nowhere
Henry comes streaking across the grounds wraps himself
around Walter’s leg

He hoists the boy onto his shoulders They walk on

EXT NORAHS DRIVEWAY

Norah’s parents wave goodbye as she drops her loaded car into
gear pulls away

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

Norah pulls onto the road rolls down the window Wind in her
hair she hits the gas

INT PORTER’S BEDROOM

Porter’s not here The room is missing things even if we’re
not sure what they are

What we notice is that on the far wall where the hole was
is Norah’s painting the one she said she always liked
EXT DRIVEWAY - DAY

Porter sits outside alone Thinking Waiting Watching

VERY SLOWLY PULL BACK to reveal he’s sitting on a fully
loaded backpack

Suddenly a huge smile spreads across his face as he spots
what he’s looking for

NEW ANGLE as Norah pulls up in her loaded car She presses a
button The trunk opens

NEW ANGLE as Porter throws his bag in the trunk
NEW ANGLE as Porter hugs his family

WALTER (VO)
This is a picture of Walter Black

Henry gives Porter a wooden compass He pats his younger
brother on the head

WALTER (VO) (CONTD)

INT NORAH’S CAR
Porter puts the compass in the middle of the dash The two of
them look at one another They LAUGH
EXT DRIVEWAY

The car starts The windows come down Porter and Norah each
stick an arm out to wave goodbye as they drive away

WALTER (VO)
Who had to become a phenomenon

ANGLE ON the family They raise their arms wave goodbye

So that ultimately this could just
be a picture-

ANGLE ON Walter’s prosthetic waving goodbye Porter’s rubber
