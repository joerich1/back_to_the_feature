in THE BEDROOM

“Killings” by Andre Dubus
FADE IN

THE SOUND OF WIND AND NOTHING ELSE

EXT GINNS POINT

We are in the midst of a field of tall grass and wild flowers
A long rutted road stretches into the distance Faintly at
first and then closer - we hear a woman squealing with
laughter We see her legs cut through the grass and fly up a

hill Close on her heels is a young man a good ten years
younger in hot pursuit

Over the field - across the tops of blades sits an ancient
apple tree We rise out of the grass and see the two young
people under the tree They are entwined - in a deep embrace
CLOSER NOW
We see them in glimpses
Their eyes - Lips - Hands -
Finally they part - the woman rests her head on his chest
She reaches out and strokes his hand
He stares at their fingers mingling together
The woman sighs
WOMAN
I Love it here
MAN
I know you do

WOMAN
I can feel my life - ya know

He stares up into the boughs above him and smiles
A legend appears IN THE BEDROOM

THE SOUND OF A BALLGAME OVER
EXT RURAL ROUTE 90 - PREDAWN

A BLUE 1973 CHEVY PICK-UP winds around a corner and
Gisappears downa long stretch of read “And that’s it from
Fenway the final scoré Oakland 3 the Redsox 7 You have been
listening to the re-broadcast of last night’s game This
broadcast is the sole property of Major League Baseball and
cannot be-”

EXT EMERSON ROAD - SAME

The truck pulls onto a small road flanked by rows of 100 year
old clapboard two-story affairs

EXT NATALIE’S HOUSE - SAME

Standing on the lawn in front of one of them is the woman from
the opening scene NATALIE STROUT pretty - beautiful actually
with a little more sleep She stands with two small boys who
are doing their best to stay warm in the morning air Her son
JASON 8 and his brother DUNCAN 4 who has his face buried in
his mother’s coat--refusing to see or be seen
The truck comes to a stop and two men get out One is young
early 20’s and even at this hour his stepis lively his ‘

face full of warmth He walks over to Natalie and gives her a i
kiss The young man from the opening scene rRANK FOWLER

The other man leans back against the passenger door He is
in his early 50’s Kind face good looking athletic in his
day - Frank’s father MATT He smiles at Natalie

Natalie smiles back

Jason starts for the truck Matt opens the door and the boy
climbs inside the cab

Frank kneels down to Duncan
FRANK

Frank reaches out and puts his hand on the boys shoulder
Duncan pulls away

Frank looks up to Natalie for help
FRANK

She smiles and shakes her head
NATALIE
Go ahead He wants to stay here

FRANK

Natalie kisses him and they’re off
INT TRUCK - SAME - MOVING

Jason in the middle He glances over to Frank - a trace of
hero worship in his face

INT STROUT and SONS CANNERY - DAWN

Sardines are processed at lightening speed We follow them on their
journey which ends with the sealed cans being packed into
cardboard shipping boxes They are taped shut by a young man we
will meet later (TIM 30) The tops read STROUT and SONS

INT ATKINS LOBSTER CO-OP DAWN

A double-55-gallon-drum wood stove is humping Several men turn their
bodies rotisserie-fashion around the thing while making morning
small talk - The starting price of lobsters the prospect of repairs
to their equipment and so on

A SCARRED HAND scribbles some figures on a wall that has been
used as a scratch pad for years

Two scales are emptied of RED FISH into a PLASTIC PICKLE BUCKET
EXT HARBOR - SAME

A pair of CANVAS TENNIS SHOES shuffle down a gangway The
bucket sways directly over them A small hand struggles with
the weight of the thing A pair of BEACON FALLS waders appear
- the shoes stop A strong hand grabs hold of the handle -
the shoes pick up the pace

EXT HARBOR - SAME
Matt and Frank prepare the rig

Jason stands on the dock taking it all in A field of
LOBSTER POTS stacked like cordwood and surrounded by a
collection of SCARRED BUOYS GRAPNEL and coiled FISHING GEAR
stiff with sea salt - all so wildly unreasonable as to seem
exotic

Jason’s eyes find the hull of “GIGI” an old Boudreau built
lobsterboat Starboard side covered in barnacles

FRANK
Cmon up Jace

MATT
Hold on a second Need to know if he’s
ready first - Jason can you tell me
whats important

Jason hesitates

FRANK
Go on tell him “eos

JASON
(nervous)
“BR shaft of sunlight at the end of a dark
afternoon a note in music--

He takes a breath

JASON
-and the way the back of a babys neck
smells if its mother keeps it tidy”

MATT
(to Frank)
You taught him well

Jason beams

- come aboard sailor
Matt reaches down to give a hand up
Frank turns the engine over It roars to life
EXT HARBOR - LATER

The sun is fast climbing into the morning sky as “GIGI
glides out of the channel and past a LIGHTHOUSE that sits
just off the point of a good sized ISLAND

Jason shields his eyes with his hand He gazes out at the

island Matt comes up beside him and sticks a baseball cap
onte his head The crown reads USS CONSTELLATION

JASON
Thank you

MATT
Ever been over there

JASON
No sir

MATT
it’s beautiful Isn‘t an island anymore
though It’s a city They have electric
lights Artesian wells even a jail -
lighthouse isn’t manned anymore - its
xun by a computer - When I lived there
had no ferry then so we didn’t even have
cars can you believe that

JASON
How’d you get back

MATT
Off the island

easement

MATT
Then we got a little outboard That was
great A seven and a half horsepower it
was - we lived there until I was about
your age - then we left and became
“harbor people”

Jason seems to be digesting this

JASON
Am I a “harbor person”

Matt hides a smile about to form

MATT
Yep Jason - we all are

Jason is full of questions Matt knows the answers and
doesn’t talk down to him Something the boy is grateful for

FRANK

At the helm His eyes squinted from glare and cold He cuts
back on the throttle and heads for the winch

GLOVED HANDS pull up a BLUE-GREEN BUOY and slide the MANILA
LINE into the WINCH

A POT surfaces and Frank sets it “Doors up” on the edge He
opens the doors His hands work quickly and efficiently He
tosses a SMALL CRAB back into the water pulls out a LOBSTER
and measures the back Too small Then a nice sized LOBSTER
is pulled out - its missing the SCISSOR CLAW He hands it to
Matt Baits the trap Throws the winch and the next pot
surfaces

HELM

Matt sits inside Jason on his lap He reaches into a WOODEN
BOX of RUBBER BANDS with a BANDING WRENCH and bands the
crustaceans remaining CRUNCHER CLAW

Jason stares at the disfigured creature

MATT
Oh boynow you see what happened to
this poor fellow

JASON
oo what

MATT
Well the trap has nylon nets called
heads--2 side heads at both ends so the
lobster can crawl in The “Bedroom” head
inside holds the bait and keeps it from
escaping--you know the old saying “two’s
company three’s a crowd”

Jason nods

i
i

Hi

MATT
Well it’s like that You get more than
two in a bedroom and chances are -
something like this is going to happen
That’s why Frank can’t leavé these traps
for more than a day-

Matt holds up another Lobster and turns it belly-up There
are black balls on both sides of the tail

MATT
Now the older females like this ol gal
are the most dangerous - especially when
they’re growin’ berries

JASON
Berries

MATT
Eggs --- one of these can take out two
males easy - Then you wind up with
lobster you can’t Sell - and as for this
fine lady she gets off easy the state
says you have to let her go

Matt throws her back in the water Holds up the other one to Jason

MATT
Can you handle this
Jason nods

MATT
(Gently)
You sure

He really isn’t Matt hands it to him

MATT
Go ahead now put it in the tank

Jason can’t get the thing in the tank fast enough

A children’s television show is heard from inside

Natalie is sprawled out on a chaise lounge nursing a beer and
sharing a cigarette with Frank who is on his hands and knees

finishing an elaborte structure with a set of FROEBEL wooden
Locks

You know I’ve been ignoring our
difference in age but if you keep
playing with those blocks I’m gonna
start to worry i

NATALIE

FRANK
They’re not blocks - they’re gifts

NATALIE
I’m sorry I know they’re a gift and a
very generous one I’m just concerned
that Dunk might think he’s a little old
to be playing with them

FRANK
They’re not for playing - theyre to learn about
unity and balance Froebel called them “Gifts”
This is the second gift - a sphere a cube and a
cylinder A five year old can learn the
difference in form depending on how they look at
em

Why didn’t he say so in the first place

NATALIE
Oh» vou said second gift How many are
are there

FRANK
Twenty

A moment

NATALIE
Youve been playing with these - excuse
me working with these for how long

PRANK
Since I was about Dunk’s age My mom took
me through all twenty

So that’s what a good mother does

NATALIE
oe Oh

yg

FRANK
Come on down here and take a look

She sets down her beer and joins him The small wooden structure
jooks like a home that could have been built by Lautner or Wright
Frank looks pleased Natalie is distracted

NATALIE
Your Mother gave you these Frank - I feel
funny Duncan having them

FRANK
Bon’t be silly it was her idea

NATALIE
(sceptical)
Really
FRANK

You’re not looking at the house - look
It’s not all mine it’s part Mack

Frank speaks excitedly as he makes a quick sketch on a colored
piece of construction paper using one of the boys’ markers

FRANK
See the whole ideal of what Mack was
trying to achieve was a common area in the
middle of the house I mean - a large
common space wasn’t unique to Mack but
the idea of separating the family so that
the kids were on one side and the parents
on the other so they would all spill into
the center

He looks over to Natalie checking in

She smiles and shifts her gaze

FRANK

I’m boring you aren’t I

NATALIE

(softly)

No not at ali I was justjust
thinking

F
About what

NATALIE
About youschool

FRANK
I’d rather talk about our house

sinning tesco URC

NATALIE
I know you would

PRANK
What if I wait a year

eon

NATALIE
Frank-

FRANK
A year’s not going to make a difference

NATALIE
You can’t do that Frank

FRANK
I’ve thought a lot about this

NATALIE
But you told me it takes forever just to
establish yourself

FRANK
Exactly so what’s a year in forever
Know what Duncan said today

She can’t suppress a smile

NATALIE °
Youwouldn’t be changing the subject
would you

FRANK
Yes

NATALIE
What now

FRANK
He said “Frank I don’t think Jason
really understands girls”

(laugh NATALIE
aughin
He didn’ 2 i g

FRANK
He did “understands girls”
NATALIE
What did you say
FRANK
I said “give him time Duncan”
They both break up
FRANK
I didn’t know what to say If this is how
he is now - boy are we in trouble-
He stops short The word - We - hangs in the air They watch each
ether unsure of how to react Changing the subject quickly Frank
reaches down to the grass and comes up with one of Duncan’s toys A
real musclebound superhero Somewhat grotesque

INT ROCKLAND HIGH SCHOOL - MUSIC ROOM - NIGHT

Half a dozen girls age 15 to 18 are gathered in Ruth’s
Classroom Desks and chairs are stacked up for summer recess
The girls are in shorts and T-shirts one with a picture of
the solar system and another with the Pink Panther Bright
bathing-suit straps are visible around some of their necks
This afternoon they were swimming A few look sleepy enough
to be in bed already Ruth stands with her arms up keeping
time and controlling the dynamics A single girl sings “The
Drone” a low monotone one hears underneath the other voices
They sing the Balkan folk song “Oj Savice”

CHORUS (SUBTITLED)

Oh Sava carry me across your quiet cool
water There is my dear village and in
that village the prettiest girl

Without embarrassment they shriek they drone and at their
ease they whistle The music transports these girls - who are
normall bre-occupied with images of MTV and Brad Pitt to a
place of pure self The song ends

RUTH
That was really good OK it’s 730
we should stop

The girls gather up their things quickly

RUTH
Remember when you sing these words—
The way we feel about the harbor is how
the Balkans felt about the river Sava

The girls start out of the room

RUTH
Listen to your tapes “Moilih Ta” is still
very rough and weve got a 40 minute
program to get ready by Labor Day

Something stops her

amp

Frank has stitches over his right eye The blood under the
white of the pupil oozing Both lips are bright and swollen

FRANK

Ruth hovers in shock

He takes the compress from Matt and gingerly applies it to his
forehead

FRANK
No

RUTH
Whats to stop him from doing it again

MATT
Did you hit him at all Tell me you hit

She returns to Matt who is leaning against the recliner chin
in hand deep in thought

RUTH

HENRY
There’s as many as 80 of em with licenses

A large gathering of relatives and friends stand before Father
Oberti as he finishes the eulogy

Matts arm is tightly interlocked with Ruths beneath her
eyes - swelling from three days of suffering Their hands
clenched together make one fist both parents keeping the
other upright The rain glides down their faces mixing easily
with tears

Matt steps up to Franks open grave

The gathering watches as Matt peers down into the hole

silently speaking to it He reaches down grabs a fistful of

dirt Then tosses it into the open grave

Matt pauses staring down into the hole

He steps back as Father Oberti delivers the end of his eulogy

his memory

The place is untouched Franks many sketches are still pinned to the
wall Some clothes lie scattered on the floor His fishing cap

Matt starts to pick up He takes Frank’s clothes from the floor
and places them on his bed

He looks at a dirty T-shirt in his hand He brings it to his face He
inhales deeply able to smell his son’s lingering scent-

Finally he sets the shirt on the bed Wanders around Strays i
near Frank’s drafting table- i

He reaches out touching the table grazing the topegraphy of
scattered pencils - drawings strewn across it The Froebel Gifts i

He takes a seat at the table Feeling its frame the sketches i
the seat below- i

And without warning he is overcome He lurches forward
burying his face in his hands The sobs come unrestrained
violently like a sudden tidal wave

The Judge nods

JUDGE

couch with Ruth

DAVIS
(to Ruth re coffee)
You sure you don’t want

RUTH
I’m fine

Davis takes a seat across from them

DAVIS
You see we can’t appeal bail It’s just
not set up that way

RUTH Soe
You let that bastard walk dut and we‘re
supposed to just sit here Don’t tell us
there’s nothing to do about this

DAVIS
Its not us Mrs Fowler The state’s bail
code is to ensure future court appearances -

i

and
i

i
i
DAVIS
In this case Strout’s family was prepared to
uit up a substantial amount of property as
ail - That along with his ties to the
community made it hard for us to convince the
judge of a serious “Risk of Flight”

RUTH
Oh - I see

DAVIS
Its not just your case Now you can file a civil
suit I recommend it But not now wait till
after the crimminal trial

Matt stares at a small cartoonish statue on Davis’s desk It is
one of those things that were popular in the 70’s A little man
chasing an ambulance It reads “World’s Greatest Lawyer”

RUTH
And when will that be Next week next
month

DAVIS
Wellhonestly - anywhere between twelve
and eighteen months

RUTH
I thought you said there would be a jury
trial sometime in October

DAVIS
If he was incarcerated the judge would
move for an October date - basically to
save the County the cost of housing and
feeding him as an inmate - But with bail
the court date unfortunately is always
later

RUTH

Oh my god oh my god

Matt jumps in

MATT
But youre confident you’1l be able te put
him away for good then Right

Davis looks uncomfortable with the question

Ruth sees this She gathers herself

RUTH og gs
The things she said in therewhat is the
damage
DAVIS

Manslaughter

sustain

RUTH DAVIS
What Oh Jesus Christ The way this is going that’d
be my bet - especially since
Nathan Strout brought up that
barracuda from Boston - she’s
very smart

RUTH
This was no accident He killed our son in
cold blood

MATT
Ruth

RUTH
What
MATT
How long would he be sent away for
DAVIS
Hard to say really Anywhere between five
to fifteen years We think we have a good
shot at the max fifteen Even with good
behavior hed do a full ten
RUTH
Ten years Five years Are you out of your
mind He killed my son Does anyone know
this
Matt looks at his shoes as Ruth glares down Davis
Davis sits back a little shook up
DAVIS
I’m sorry Mrs Fowler I understand
Unfortunately in situations like this

the change in his pocket the way people de when they’re
uncomfortable
DAVIS

Matt nods without looking at him

Matt looks at Davis’s hand moving the change He becomes
hypnotized by the sound

Davis continues talking Matt can’t hear a word of it
though Allhe hears is the clinking of the coins in the
pocket

making notations on a sheet of manuscript paper

There’s a KNOCK on her docr She doesn’t look up

Natalie takes a step in

Ruth looks up If she’s surprised she doesn’t show it

NATALIE
I I hope this is okay
Ruth says nothing Natalie moves closer
NATALIE
I’ve been hoping we might be able to get
together - to talk

Ruth watches her as she approaches the desk Natalie bends and
cautiously extends her hand for Ruth to hold

NATALIE
I just want to tell you how

And in a flash Ruth SLAPS Natalie across the face with her open
and

Natalie springs back paralyzed with shock

She tries to catch her breath staring dicectly at Ruth

Eyes ablaze Ruth says nothing

The two women look at each other for a very long time

And finally as if she finally somehow got the resolution she
gh Natalie turns and walks out

sternman was gonna take a bat to the old
man and mé so’s I told the old man about
it and he says “Don’t hurt my feelings
none”He says “Go on down to the Walmart
and buy a couple of plastic bats”
Next day the old man walks intah the
office at the market - near the scales -
where he know’s the son of a bitch is
gonna come in with his catch He’s got two
Six penny nails a hammer and the bats
o’coarse so he nails those things right
intah the wall The guy at the scales

There is a car in front of him Above the licence plate isa

yellow sticker which reads “Student Driver” The plate itself
as a vanity plate it says PRAY4US

A 73 BLUE PICK-UP truck eases to a stop in the right lane next
to Matt’s car
Matt glances over for a moment he half expects to see Frank
He cracks the passenger side window for a better look
He stares at the drivers window
Their window rolls down

An attractive girl with short brunette hair stares back at
Matt

Lost in the absurdity he doesn’t look away
The light changes

The girl smiles sweetly and blows him a kiss before
continuing through the light

Matt watches her go - he smiles - as if somehow relieved

The car behind him gives a polite toot - Matt makes the

INT FOWLER HOUSE- THE DEN DUSK

Matt sits comfortably feet up beer in hand deep into the
book MORTE D‘URBAN by JF Powers

He HEARS the front door SLAM

He doesn’t move 4 ge

Almost immediately he hears the banging of cupboards opening
and closing

KITCHEN

Ruth is putting groceries away ignoring or trying to Matt
who has appeared in the doorway

She puts milk in the refrigerator and stares into it for a long
Fime trying to decide what to do He can feel her judging
im

Finally having resolved something in her mind she closes
the refrigerator door- revealing taped to it several
newspaper articles on the case gathered by her no doubt

including one with a picture of Frank

MATT
How did it go today
She doesn’t answer

MATT
Something wrong

She doesn’t turn around
RUTH
Wrong Like what Matt What could be
wrong

She continues “straightening up” starts recklessly washing
ishes

Matt doesn’t leave
A plate SHATTERS in the sink
This stops her She stares at it then feels his presence She
turns around
RUTH
What do you want

He looks unsure of himself

MATT
I want to know what’s going on

RUTH
Right

MATT
You’re obviously upset If there’s
something you want to talk about

RUTH age
Talk Who us Oh you mean to each other
What if somebody walked in They wouldnt
recognize us They’d think they had the
wrong house

Matt takes this in He breathes deeply

MATT
Do you want to talk or not

RUTH

(searching”
Talk talk oh you must mean about our
dead son No we haven’t before why
should we bother now

They stare at each other across the kitchen
MATT
(slow burn)
What can I do Ruth

Ruth looks at him for a long time

RUTH
Forget it Matt Why don’t you just go

MATT
(building)
What do you want from me

RUTH
I want you to stop acting like nothing’s
happened That’s what I want

MATT
Why because I’m not bouncing off the
walls

RUTH
No Matt That would require feelings We
don’t want you to hurt yourself

MATT
Do me a favor Ruth You want to have a
grieving contest go find someone else

He starts to turn

RUTH
yeah I know how you grieve Go have
another beer

He spins back

MATT
WHAT DO YOU KNOW WHAT You know nothing
You know nothing about me What I go
through - every day - every lousy
stinking day

RUTH
No I don’t know Matt I don’t know what
you go through or if you go through
anything But that’s your choice dear
not mine

MATT
You’re goddamn right it is My choice is
to not scream at the world Maybe one of
us has tc be reasonable here did you ever
think of that

RUTH
Reasonable Gee Matt I don’t know about
you but I miss my son I’m glad you have
time for reason That’s what you imparted
to Frank That sense of reason - Oh he
thought you were very reasonable

MATT
What the hell is that supposed to mean

She is about to say something but stops short

RUTH
Nothing

She turns back to the dishes

He moves in on her seething

MATT
What are you really trying to say anyway

She says nothing picking up the broken plates

MATT
eoethat Im the one responsible
She drops the pieces back in the sink and exits
THE HALL
He‘s fast on her heels She heads for the bedroom
MATT
Let me tell you something Let me tell you
something

She throws the door closed behind her but he bangs it open
with his palm

MATT
You got it backwards I know what you
think That I was too lenient that I let
him get away with
RUTH

She exits into
THE HALL

He’s right behind her

MATT
Oh really Why do you think he never
came to you

RUTH
He wouldn’t talk to me Matt He didn’t
trust me You made sure of that

THE LIVING ROOM

MATT
Why would he talk to you Ruth You never
listened

RUTE
No But you did You were winking at him
the whole time You encouraged him You
wanted what he had Her

MATT
You’ve got to be kidding

RUTH
You know it Come on You wanted it and you
couldn’t get it - that’s why you didn’t stop him -
so you could get your kicks through your son
You know that’s what happened And now you can’t
cope with it You can’t admit the truth - To me
or to yourself You can’t admit that he died for
your fantasy piece of ass

Matt stunned reels for a second -
And then finally explodes

MATT
You want to know why our son is dead
Ruth He wasn’t with her because of me he
went there because of you Because you
were so controlling so overbearing so
angry that he was it that he was our only
one

RUTH
That is not true

MATT
It is From the time he was little you
were telling him why he was wrong
Everything he did was wrong What was
wrong with him Ruth

She stares at him dumbfounded

MATT “eas
You are so unforgiving You are That’s
what he said And you’re playing the same
shit out with me That’s a horrible way to
be Horrible You’re bitter Ruth You
can point your finger at me all you want -

MATT
-but you better take a good look at
yourself first

She already has of course
RUTH

(weary)
I jest wanted to talk about what happened
Matt

MATT
You expect me just to open up to you
Embrace you You scare me How can I talk
to you I can’t even look at you

They suddenly become aware of the DOORBELL ringing over and
over

They watch each other both reeling both out of breath The
DOORBELL continues

MATT
(completely drained)
Thats probablythe police

THE DOOR

Matt opens it There is no cop just Kristen Gellar 12 a young

Matt waits as the girl fills out and hands him the receipt
He closes the door before she can thank him
THE LIVING ROOM
Ruth is curled up on the couch

Matt stands over her unsure of which way to go

He reaches out stroking her head pulling her matted hair from
her forehead as she sobs into his lap

RUTH
I’m sorry I have been so angry - I keep
seeing him Matt I’ve seen him

Matt nods but he’s not really clear

MATT
(confused)
---Oh I know - up in his room - Sometimes

INT GRINNEL HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

The game has just started Willis deals Henry Carl and Willis
pick up the old banter as if Matt had only been away on
vacation but he can see the affection and courtesy in their
eyes

WILLIS
The name of the game is Texas Chase’em

Henry groans
WILLIS
Is there a problem
HENRY
Why do you delude yourself with that
crap

WILLIS
What are you talking about

HENRY
Look we’re not in Vegas It’s five card
draw or seven card stud

WILLIS

HENRY
Asshole

Matt smiles He’s missed these guys

CARL
Ill open with a dollar

HENRY
Raise a buck

The bet’s to Matt He stares at his cards for a very long
time Willis looks to say something when Henry hits his arm
This stops him

Matt looks up He sees the patience they are all exercising

for his typical indecisiveness This bothers him

He stares back down at his cards Stalling waiting for
someone to bust him

He looks up at Willis - Henry - Carl They all sort of smile
uncomfortably He can’t take’ it

8 Os

MATT
Oh for Christ sake say something

This wakes them up

yonseennnnsansncesseancnsetin

MATT
Quit pussy footing around me dammit You
just gonna let me stare at these cards
all night
No one wants to make the first move
This upsets Matt even more

MATT
OK fine

He stares back down at his cards

Finally it is Carl who speaks

CARL
There are things of which I may not speak
There are dreams that cannot die
There are thoughts that make the strong heart weak
And bring a pallor into the cheek
And a mist before the eye
And the words of that fatal song
come over me like a chill
A boy’s will is the winds will
And the thoughts of youth are long long thoughts

Matt looks up from his cards into Carl’s eyes

The two men regard each other

EXT GRINNEL HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

The game has ended Matt says goodnight to Henry and Cari as
the two of them pull out of Willis’s driveway Matt is about to
leave Just climbing in the front seat When Willis puts a hand
on his shoulder

WILLIS
Come back in for a drink

INT GRINNEL HOUSE- ENTRY HALL - NIGHT

INT GRINNEL HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

A few minutes later

Matt sits alone in the room He gets up to examine a picture
hanging on the opposite wall He’s not particularly a
interested he’s seen it a million times he’s just killing
time A corner of the room devoted to Naval memories A
pristine version of Matts USS CONSTELLATION cap serves as
the center piece

Willis comes down from upstairs

WILLIS
She’s all set - now what can I get you

MATT

Willis nods and takes a seat

WILLIS

MATT
I don’t know - sort of silly really

WILLIS eos

MATT
This thing with - with Frank when he was

folk’s house

MATT
Mom always liked little dogs - this one

hearing this yelp and then a scream
Frank ran out pointing to his finger 1

said Frank must have “cornered the dog”
and I knew she was probably right we
were driving home and Ruth no iced Frank
itching his“armshe pulled back his
sleeve and there were these two deep
bloody puncture marks

WILLIS
Why do you think he pointed to his
finger
Matt shakes his head
MATT
(Searching)
eel guess he didnt want us to know
He stares into his hands as the memory crystallizes
Willis looks confused and somewhat uncomfortable

WILLIS

coe

He gets up and heads te the bar
MATT
(to himself)
ee ehad to put that dog down
Willis throws some ice in a tumbler
WILLIS
I was thinking just the other day about

Matt cuts him off

MATT
His name was Frank Not Frankie

Willis looks stunned
WILLIS 08
eoel’M Sorry Matt

MATT
I don’t carehe just never liked being
called that

WILLIS
OK

Matt nods He looks away

MATT
She didn’t tell me Willis She never
said a word - She saw him at South End

WILLIS

MATT
She’s seen him before It’s killing her -
I didn’t think about bail I thought I
wouldnt have to worry about him for
years

WILLIS
You know what I heard He’s tending bar
up to Old Orchard Beach

Matt looks up

WILLIS
For a friend Ever notice even the worst
bastards have friends Nobody knows him
over there If they do they don’t care
They drink what he mixes

Willis sets a can of Moxie down in front of Matt

WILLIS
(xveferring to the can)
I don’t know how you drink this stuff -
it’s what drove me to beer as a child

He sits down with his own drink
A moment

WILLIS
I hate him Matt My boys went to school
with him He was the same thei Know
what he’1ll do Five at the most And
then youll be bumping into him all over
again -

MATT
I know

WILLIS
Remember that woman about seven years
ago Shot her husband and dropped him off
the bridge in the St Georgé’ with a
hundred pound sack of cement and said the
whole way through it nobody helped her
Know where she is now She’s in Searsport
now a secretary And whoever helped her
where the hell is he

WILLIS
It’d break my heart Matt it would but
you ever think about just - moving away
Matt nods Stares into his hands for a long time

MATT
yeah we have

Finally he looks up his eyes meeting Willis’s

MATT

It wouldn’t matter
THE SOUND OF A LONE FEMALE VOICE - SINGING
EXT CAMDEN AMPHITHEATER - MAGIC HOUR
The voice is joined by another and becomes a duet We turn to
find the voices and see we are at the foot of a small knoll
A steeple in the distance pokes thorough the last blue husk
as the sun dies Looking around we see an ancient gazebo -
then stairs leading up to a stone library - A boulder at the
foot of another knoll - above - descending toward us -
The girls each holding a single candledressed in brightly
embroidered smocks enter in procession singing “Jennie Mae

ama”

The effect is beautiful and feels like a sort of quickening
The group proceeds down the hill and blossoms into an -
AMPHITHEATER which faces the harbor Ruth stands at the
bottom of the proscenium - her arms up - directing the choir
The place is filled with half the town

Trying to take it all in But not really present

left hand removes the glove from his right and wipes the
sweat from his bare palm onto his pantleg He puts the glove
back on gripping the gun

Richards Brown Suburban drives down an alley adjacent to Fun
Park and turns onto a deserted Main Street

INTEXT BROWN SUBURBAN - NIGHT

They drive back through town the sea wall on their left hiding
the beach

On the right are the places most with their neon signs off
that do so much business in summer the lounges and cafes and
pizza houses The street itself empty of traffic

RICHARD
He was making it with my wife

His voice is careful not pleading
Matt presses hard with the muzzle against Richard’s head
Richard flinches and moves his head forward

Matt lowers the gun to his lap

MATT
Don’t talk

The Brown Suburban slowly pulls up to the front

Matt leans forward The muzzle grazing Richards head

Matt COCKS it

MATT
It is now

Richard tenses He drives around the side of the building
EXT RICHARD STROUT’S DUPLEX - BACK YARD - NIGHT

The Brown Suburban inches forward toward the garage and
brakes The engine shuts off

Matt keeps the cocked gun firmly trained on Richard He gets
out and shuts the door with his hip
MATT
All right

Richard looks at the gun then gets out He moves across the
grass

Matt closely behind looking at the row of small backyards on
either side of them and scattered tall trees

He glances from house to house Looking for signs of one
insomniac neighbor some man or woman sitting a one watching
the all-night channel from Boston All is quiet
They move up the back walk and to the side kitchen door
Matt stands directly behind Richard as he opens the door
Its pitch black inside the duplex
MATT

Turn on the light
Richard flips the wall switch
In the light
Matt stares at his wide back and long reach
INT RICHARD STROUT’S DUPLEX - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Richard stops past inside the kitchen Matt closes the door
softly behind him

MATT

Richard almost turns around

RICHARD
My suitcase

Matt grips the gun tighter straining to keep it from
trembling

MATT
Where is it

RICHARD
In the bedroom closet

MATT
Thats where were going then When we get
to a door you stop and turn on the light

They cross the kitchen
Matt cant help but glance at the sink and stove and
refrigerator no dishes in the sink or even the dish rack

beside it no grease splashings on the stove the refrigerator
clean and white

Matt becomes momentarily preoccupied with one of Duncan’s
drawings - taped to its door

MATT
Wait

Richard stops

Matt looks conflicted Doubt has crept into his face For a
moment he seems to have lost his resolve

RICHARD 0S

Matt looks to Richard with a renewed sense of purpose

MATT
e-keep going

LIVING ROOM
A light flicks on They take the hall past the living room
Matt doesn’t want to see anymore of Richards life But he
can’t help himself He takes it all in Magazines and
newspapers in a wicker basket clean ashtrays a stereo
CD’s neatly shelved next to it
They continue down a hallway Richard stops outside a door
RICHARD
There’s no wall switch
MATT
Wheres the Light

RICHARD
By the bed

MATT
Let’s go

Richard steps into the darkness Matt is careful to stay a
ace behind Richard leans over by the bed Matt braces
lick A small bedside lamp turns on

The bed a double one is neatly made the ashtray on the
bedside table clean the bureau top dustless and no
photographs probably so the girl - who is she - wont have
to seé Natalie in the bedroom she believes is theirs But
because Matt is a father and a husband though never an ex-
husband he knows (and does not want to know that this
bedroom has never been theirs alone

Richard turns around Matt looks at his lips his wide jaw

RICHARD
I wanted to work things out with her
Try to get together with her again
But I couldnt even talk to her
He was always with her
Dr Fowler Im going to jail for it
I am going to jail Tf I ever get out

Pack clothes for warm weather

RICHARD
Whats going on Youre not gonna let me

Matt looks away He doesn’t answer

RICHARD
Dr Fowler

MATT

RICHARD

Matt points the pistol at Richard’s face The barrel trembles
a little

Richard reaches upinto his closet and pulls outtwo large

stacked Richard arranges them neatly in the suitcase The

the things a man accumulates and become part of him

MATT

Okay thats enough

RICHARD
I need some things from the bathroom

MATT

THE BATHROOM
Richard steps just inside the bathroom door and stops

MATT
Keep going

RICHARD
Gotta pee

Matt realizes Richard means to have privacy

He pushes him into the room Takes a step back and pulis the
door so it is only slightly ajar He keeps his foot between
the jam and the door

He eyes Richards back reflected in the mirror He can hear
him make water He looks like he wonders about allowing this
courtesy

Matts glances at

A picture on the wall outside of the bathroom Natalie and
Richard and their two boys in front of someones house
Smiling She looks happy

RICHARD

that will help his situation - he flushes the toilet - Matt

swings the door fully open - Richard fills a travel kit with
toiletries

on him

Richard closes the suitcase and faces Matt He looks at the

fishing boats bobbing at anchor in the cove

Swirling colors from behind catch their attention

Richard and Matt both look in the rear-view

A state trooper’s car with its gumballs flashing races up in
the distance behind them

Matt jams the gun into Richard’s ribs and slouches down

MATT WATCHES RICHARD’S LARGE BIG KNUCKLED HANDS TIGHTEN ON THE WHEEL

They crawl up the trail the wheels crunching the gravel the

headlights shining into the dense woods

zhe road seems endless Richard cringes as they bounce over a
UMP

Both of them eagerly peer beyond the windshield

Finally ata great distance the tiny lit windows of a cabin
come into view A BLUE CHEVY PICK-UP is parked in front of the
place

Stop here

The Brown Suburban crawls to a stop Richard keeps the engine
cunning Matt presses the gun hard against his neck He
straightens in his seat and looks in the rearview mirror
Matts eyes meet his in the glass for an instant before

focusing on the hair at the end of the gun barrel

MATT
Turn it off

Richard does The ballgame disappears and the silence is
strangely apparent He continues to hold the wheel with both
hands He looks in the mirror

MATT
Almost there

Richard carefully gets out Instinctively he raises his hands
about shoulder level They move to the back of the Brown
Suburban Richard pops the hatch

He pulls out the two canvas bags He sets them on the ground
He reaches in and pulls out the small suitcase

We hear a SCREEN DOOR slam shut Richard looks surprised
He turns back to Matt

MATT

Richard reaches down and picks up the bags He struggles to
carry all three
Matt grabs the small suitcase from him

MATT
That way

Richard lugs the bags toward the cabin

We hear HEAVY CRUNCHING FOOTSTEPS OF SOMEONE APPROACHING
Richard stops

He nods to Matt

RICHARD
Mr Grinnel

WILLIS

Willis takes the bags from Richard turns and carries them up
the long path back to the cabin

He waits a moment unsure of what to do
Finally he starts walking up the path after Willis

Richard stops mid-step He tenses waiting

MATT —

Richard turns

He reaches out to take the bag from Matt

Matt keeps it at his side and takes a step back his gun
trained on Richard

RICHARD CONNECTS WITH MATTS EYES

HE KNOWS

RICHARD DUCKS AND TAKES ONE STEP THAT’S THE BEGINNING OF A SPRINT
BOOM

THE GUN KICKS IN MATT’S HAND

THE GUNS REPORT ECHOES FOR AN ETERNITY

MATT STANDS ABSOLUTELY STILL

HE STILL HOLDS THE LITTLE SUITCASE

HE LOOKS DOWN AT RICHARD STROUT SQUIRMING ON HIS BELLY KICKING
ONE LEG BEHIND HIM PUSHING HIMSELF FORWARD TOWARD THE WOODS

MATT WATCHES DISPASSIONATELY

HE STEPS FORWARD RAISES THE GUN AND FIRES ONE MORE SHOT
RICHARD STOPS MOVING

Matt stands there motionless

We hear FOOTSTEPS

Willis runs up to Matt

HE STOPS AT RICHARDS CORPSE

The two men look into each others eyes Matt seems to be somewhere else

He looks back down at the body

WILLIS

suitcase in the other eyes

THE BODY

wrapped in a BLUE TARP is suddenly dragged away by the ATV It
makes quite a racket

We follow it as it scrapes along the road back into the woods
THE WOODS

They have removed the body from the ATV and are now dragging it
deep into the wood The only sound is the breaking of branches
and their continual grunting

ahey stop at the top of a small knoll panting and sweating
Willis quietly removes a small mass of branches revealing a
large well-dug hole Together they drag the body to the edge
of the hole Move behind it Lift the legs and push it in

THE WOODS - LATER -

Willis and Matt come up from the woods They carry Richard’s
iuggage « Willis drops the canvas bags into the hole Matt
looks at the suitcase and then drops it in

Willis takes a couple of steps away and grabs two shovels
leaning against a small birch He hands one to Matt
Together they begin filling in the hole

SAME PLACE - LATER -

Matt holds the flashlight as Willis sprinkles leaves and
branches over the hole

Willis freezes as if he has heard something Matt cuts the
ight

They hear some footsteps approaching closer then they see it -
A DEER

not 30 yards distant watching them A Buck with a splendid rack
a deep chest snowy white all of him in his prime His flag up

and twitching His eyes unmoving
Then he bounds off and is gone

both look up through the trees where they end at the lake

Neither of them speak only the sounds of their heavy breathing
and clumsy strides through the low brush and over fallen
ranches

He doesn’t respond Instead he looks at his finger
The bandage wet from washing up

He slides it off easily like an oversized ring
The skin has healed

Sun light creeps in through the curtains onto Matts face
Ruth lies sleeping on his chest

Abreakfast tray at his bedside which he hasn’t touched

His eyes full of an unspeakable sadness
The lids heavy If only he could sleep

But he won’t Not today

There is a small crack in the ceiling

He’lil have to fix that
