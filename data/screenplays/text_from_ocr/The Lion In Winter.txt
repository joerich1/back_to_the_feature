THE LION IN WINTER

Second Draft of
A Screenplay

by

James Goldman

Revised 11th October
AWORD ABOUT CASTLES

THE LION IN WINTER was a special and peculiar sort of history
play To make its style and intention clear on film the look
of the castle where it occurs and the sense of castle life
need to be earthly real and at the same time strikingly
different from what were used to seeing in King Arthur
movies

Almost nothing is known about the castle at Chinon as it was
in Henrys time and little enough is known about 12th century
castles in general One thing-is clear however and
important for our purposes only that such castles looked
nothing like what we expect

The stone fortresses that remain today were only the shell of
castles as they were lived in Most of the shelter for most
of the staff all of the workshops -- the armories forges
Stables and so on -- were made of wood A castle courtyard
was a crowded teeming dirty place with much more wood than
stone to greet the eye

A major castle as Chinon was was like a miniature town
Everything necessary to the life of the establishment existed
inside the walls Poultry livestock looms and tailors
mills for grinding grain vast storerooms water wells boot
makers gardens -- everything vital to life under siege was
somehow packed in

At special times like the Christmas Court during which the
film occurs the congestion was even worse than usual AIl
guests the visiting nobles and clergymen traveled with
trains of varying size So that in addition to the usual
crowding we find hundreds of soldiers and servants living
outdoors jammed together in tents huddling for warmth around
dozens of fires

Living conditions even for royalty were crude and rough
The castle rooms were spartan a bed a few chairs chests for
Storage clothes hung in the open on racks Floors were

covered with Straw which-was-sweptaway and replaced only
occasionally Interiors at high noon on a clear day Were oo
always dark illumination coming from extremely smoky torches

and candles In winter wind whistled through the open slit

windows and the place was freezing cold

A lot of their habits seem oddly contradictory In spite of
the cold everyone from the King to his vassal slept naked
In the midst of the general crudeness nobles wore the most
exquisite fabrics -- cloths of gold and silver delicate
brocades Clothing was generally dirty and even at a
Christmas Court nothing looked clean Tables were set with
fine linen and napkins of a kind were used yet most of the
eating was done with fingers Sanitary conditions were

Li

appalling For some reason castles in addition to their
human tenants were populated by hundreds of dogs

All these things -- the grime and dirt and cold the coarse-
ness and crudity of life in general -- are vital to the look
of the film On the whole there are few specific references
to these elements in the screenplay Rather than clutter up
the goings on with data It seemed better to suggest them
here and let the castle that the story moves in be imagined

ANOTE ABOUT MUSIC

On the stage Christmas carols were used for incidental music
in good effect Carols used were from all periods There is
something available through musical style -- using medieval
instruments to play 19th century tunes with contemporary
harmonizations that should have a considerable help in
letting an audience know that its an odd and different kind
of history show that theyre seeing

The point to be made here is that the music is a useful and
important element It wants to be crisp clear spirited and
above all distinctive that is it needs to have a sound we
havent heard before And because the style of the writing
involves a mixing of odd elements it seems right that the
freshness of musical sound should be achieved the same way

poised for dueling sword in hand

(HENRY is 50 an age at which in his time men ‘

j were either old or dead Not HENRY Very nearly
all he ever was he is enjoying that final rush of i
physical and mental vigor that comes to some men
not before the end but just before the state of the
decline

(As the title fades the pictures starts to move
and HENRY barks out )

HENRY

Come on Come for me

C) 2 (He brings his sword down and the duel begins His
OPPONENT whom we see from behind charges at him
raining blow after blow HENRY parries only never
striking back always retreating

(They fight across the field Suddenly HENRY
moving backwards trips and falls With a cry his
OPPONENT charges at him Effortlessly HENRY
strikes his first blow The OPPONENTS sword flies
from his hand as he sprawls flat out on the ground
HENRY bounds to his feet moves to his fallen

giant of a man They meet with tremendous impact
The GIANT KNIGHT is sent flying violently to the
ground

(We are in the lists watching a contest It is
not the set were used to seeing - grandstands
canopies banners At this time the lists
consisted of the broad shallow mud trench that lay
between the inner and outer walls of a castle It
is primitive and crude not glamorous The
audience either stands or sits on straw spread on
the mud There sit one or two crude benches for
the most important nobles present

(The smaller KNIGHT himself a large man leaps
from his horse throws off his visor and we get our
first look at RICHARD LIONHEART

(RICHARD at 26 looks like his legend handsome
impressive fierce powerful He loves the blood
and violence of war He is caught up in this
passion when we see him and his face is
frightening

feline attractive quick of speech and movement
His was the best brain of a brainy family and his

of the troops below

(We see the field behind him A large body of
KNIGHTS in full armor on horse stand divided into
two orderly groups one some distance to his left
the other to his right

(GEOFFREY signals to one of the groups We see
them charge wildly down the cliff They come down
in front of the troops below

start to run in retreat

(GEOFFREY signals to his other group of KNIGHTS

on the beech is terrible

slaughter but at a maneuver well planned and
executed

appears As they open the gate cut to -

A large cold relatively barren castle room

A few chairs wooden chests a bed a few wall
tapestries straw on the floor Even when we come

elegance did not exist The only richness of the
period was in the fabrics of the clothes the
wealthy wore)

ELEANORS ROOM SALISBURY TOWER

(The camera takes in the room A GUARD stands by
the rooms one door He is a young and splendid
looking soldier except for the fact that his left
arm at a point just above the elbow has been lost
in combat In one corner of the room there are
two Maids-in-waiting doing needlework by the small
window We come finally to a fireplace There is
a blazing fire There is an armchair by the fire
In it sits -

(ELEANOR OF AQUITAINE She is 61 and looks nothing
like it She is a truly handsome woman of great
temperament authority and presence She has been
a Queen of international importance for 46 years
and you know it Finally she is that most unusual
thing a genuinely feminine woman thoroughly
capable of holding her own in a mans world

(When we first see her she is gazing into the
fire deep in thought there is no sense of
repose this is not reverie The eyes burn and the
mind is busy

(We are looking past her towards the door It
opens The one-armed GUARD comes to attention as
MARSHAL enters and bows)

(Standing before him stiff and formal)
Sixteen years ago you made a treaty with us It is time its
terms were executed

The scene through most of the following exchange
between Philip and Henry is a domestic one ALAIS
passes along them with a tray of drinks and hors
doeuvres ELEANOR settles comfortable taking
some needlework from a bag and works on it JOHN
busies himself decking the hall with boughs of
holly GEOFFREY finding the hors doeuvres
delicious settles by a table that holds an
assortment of them Only RICHARD fails to relax
He stands apart from all of them suspicious and
hostile)

HENRY
I should think so

PHILIP
Our position comes to this that you either hold the marriage
or return the Vexin Alais marries Richard or well have the
county back at once

HENRY
Thats clear concise and well presented My position is --
well frankly Philip its a tangle

As he rises and moves to RICHARD all
affability)

Two years ago the Queen and I for reasons passing under-
standing gave the Aquitaine to Richard That makes Richard
very powerful How can I give him Alais too The man she
marries has you for an ally

PHILIP
Its their wedding or the Vexin back Those are the terms you
made with Louis

HENRY
(Moving to PHILIP Just the two of them now)
True but academic lad The Vexins mine

PHILIP
By what authority

HENRY
Its got my troops all over it that makes it mine Now hear
me boy --

PHILIP
I am a king Im no mans boy

HENRY

A king Because you put your ass on purple cushions

PHILIP

(He turns on his heel starts for the door)

(Cut to HENRY and ELEANOR as they exchange amused
glances )

HENRY
Philip you havent got the feel of this at all Use all your
voices When I bellow bellow back

PHILIP

HENRY
(Moving close to PHILIP)
This too We are the world in smail A nation is a human
thing It does what we do for our reasons Surely if were
civilized it must be possible to put the knives away We can
make peace We have it in our hands

PHILIP
Ive tutors of my own Will that be all

HENRY

taxes that I get to him

ELEANOR
How nice for you

GEOFFREY
Its not as nice as being king

HENRY
Weve made you Duke of Brittany Is that so little

GEOFFREY
No one ever thinks of crown and mentions Geoff What is that

HENRY
Isnt being Chancellor power enough

GEOFFREY
It isnt power that I feel deprived of its the mention that I

clearly a raw nerve)

HENRY

ELEANOR
He found Miss Clifford in the mists of Wales and brought her home
for closer observation Liking what he saw he scrutinized her
many years He loved her deeply and she him And yet my dear
when Henry had to choose between his lady and my lands

ALAIS
There is no sport in hurting me It is so easy

ELEANOR
After all the years of love and care do you think I could
bring myself to hurt you

ELEANOR

Theres no one Come on lets finish Christmassing the place

(She moves to a pile of ornaments on a table by the
Christmas tree Through the following like any
Moin and they decorate the tree Much care is
devoted to placing the proper ornament just so
glancing at each other for reaction to the
decorating shakes and nods of heads

HENRY
Time hasnt done a thing but wrinkle you

ELEANOR
It hasnt even done that I have borne six girls five boys
and thirty-one connubial years of you How am I possible

HENRY
There are moments when I miss you

ELEANOR
(They pause smiling fondly at each other Then
reaching out and tousling his hair)

Thats my woolly sheep dog So wee Johnny gets the crown

HENRY
Ive heard it rumored but I dont believe it

ELEANOR
Losing Alais will be hard for you do love her

HENRY
Its an old mans last attachment nothing more How hard do
you find living in your castle

ELEANOR
It was difficult in the beginning but thats past I find Ive
seen the world enough

HENRY
Ill never let you loose You led too many civil wars against
me

ELEANOR
And I damn near won the last one Still as long as I get
trotted out for Christmas Courts and state occasions now and

the knob HENRY pauses turns)

Its an odd thing Eleanor Ive fought and bargained all
these years as the only thing I lived for was what happened
after I was dead Ive something else to live for now Ive
blundered on to peace

ELEANOR
(Wry amusement on her face)
On Christmas Eve

HENRY
Since Louis died while Philip grew Ive had no France to
fight And in lull Ive found how good it is to write a law
or make a tax more fair or in judgment to decide which peasant
gets a cow There is I tell you nothing more important in
the world And now the French boys big enough and I am sick
of war

INT CORRIDOR AND BROAD HALL

(He opens the door moves into the corridor She
follows We go with them down the hallway It is
dimly lit by smoky wall torches The corridor is
empty except for occasional quietly prowling dogs
Castles at the time were full of dogs and
throughout the film the animals are everywhere)

ELEANOR
Do you still need the vexin Henry

HENRY
Its as crucial as it ever was My troops there are a day away
from Paris just a march of twenty miles I must keep it

tables piled high with food The royal table is at
the far end of the hall on a platform PHILIP
RICHARD GEOFFREY JOHN and ALAIS are there

(The hall is heated by a huge fire that blazes on
the stones in the center of the room Some of the
smoke rises to escape from a hole in the ceiling
Torches are everywhere The smoke is terrible
There is much howling from a multitude of dogs

ORCHESTRA plays a fanfare and EVERYBODY rises

Behind him in the corridor the one-armed GUARD
closes the door RICHARD stays by the doorway
looking at his mother She is aware that hes
there but goes on wrapping the package RICHARD
moves from the doorway toward her saying

RICHARD

RICHARD
My love of all thing What would you want it for

ELEANOR
Why for itself What other purpose could I have

RICHARD
If I were you Id try another tack I have no damned up
floods of passion for you Theres no chance Ill overflow

ELEANOR
You think Im motivated by a love of real estate

RICHARD

courtyard The caroling resumes

Kings Queens knights everywhere you look and Im the only
pawn I havent got a thing to lose That makes me dangerous

from them -- not after HENRY but in another
direction)

loss crosses her face)

yard toward a low stone wall)
Well thats how deals are made Weve got him if we want him
He will sell us all you know but only if he thinks we think

wooden door She opens the door moves through and

(A small cloistered herb garden It is a
perfectly beautiful place small formal beds of
rich frozen earth delicate arches and columns
along the walls graceful stone benches Distant
hills rise high and stark beyond the far wall The
sun a perfect faint orange ball floats just above
the hill-tops Occasionally scraps of caroling
come floating to us it is a setting of great
gentleness and peace

(ELEANOR settles on a bench looks up at her son)

at one time many appetites I wanted poetry and power and the
young men who create them both I even wanted Henry too in
those days Now Ive only one desire left to see you King

RICHARD
The only thing you want to see is Fathers vitals on a bed of
lettuce You dont care who wins as long as Henry loses
Youd do anything You are Medea to the teeth but this is one
son you wont use for vengeance on your husband

(ELEANOR rises moving away from the vehemence of
it She moves to the low wall stands looking out)

ELEANOR
How my captivity has changed you Henry meant to hurt me and
hes hacked you up instead
(Her hands rest on the top of the wall They
catch her eye She raises the hand looks at it)
Men coveted this talon once Henry was eighteen when we met
and I was Queen of France

(The camera rises higher and higher As she goes
on speaking we see the two of them in the lovely
frozen garden from high above

(Then shifting slowly we begin to see the country-
side beyond the wall There are little scattered
houses small farms neat fields Here a horse
moves down a black dirt path drawing a wagon
there a group of young people -- children and
adolescents -- are skating on a frozen pond

(We move closer to the young people near enough to
see how happy young and beautiful they are
Through all this -)

ELEANOR (Cont)
He came down from the North to Paris with a mind like
Aristotles and a form like mortal sin We shattered the
Commandments on the spot I spent three months annulling Louis
and in Spring in May not far from here we married Young
Count Henry and his countess But in three years time I was
his Queen and he was King of England Done at twenty-one
Five years your junior General

blossoms in my garden

You were lovely once Ive seen the pictures
ELEANOR
Oh dont you remember how you loved me We were always hand

(She thrusts her hand in his)
Thats how it felt

reaches the top of the wall swings himself up He
looks about The camera draws back to show him
high on the top of the towering Gate House that
guards the entrance to the castle yard

(He moves to the front edge of the tower roof
There are vines on the outside He looks further
Still none Seemingly hesitating he moves
fearlessly over the edge Hands and feet finding
tiny crevasses in the rough-hewn stone he starts
down

up

He has come a long way

dagger from his belt takes careful aim and throws
it)

finger It rummages among the jewels finally

alone She has been putting on jewelry for quite
some time and bracelets necklaces she is covered

Ill have him next time I can wait Ah - there you are

(Cut to the crown in the chest Voice over)
My comfort and my company

(Her hands appear She picks the crown up)

Were locked in for another year four seasons more Oh what
desolation what a lifes work

(GEOFFREY appears in the doorway some distance
behind her She turns smiling brightly as she
puts the crown on She already wears a small
coronet and the effect of two crowns on at once
is a little mad)

Is it too much Be sure to squint as you approach You may be
awed by my beauty

GEOFFREY
Merry Christmas

Is that why youre here -- to tell me that

GEOFFREY
I thought you might be lonely

GEOFFREY
Its puzzling I remember my third birthday Not just
pictures of the garden or the gifts but who did what to whom
and how it felt My memory stretches back that far and never
once can I remember anything from you or father warmer than
indifference Why is that

ELEANOR
I dont know

(He is by the table looking down at her They are
close) —

ELEANOR

Im weary and you want a simple answer and I havent one

(Starting to remove the jewelry)
I was thinking earlier of Peter Abelard I was a Queen of
fifteen in those days and on dull afternoons Id go watch
Eloise watch Abelard spread heresy like bonemeal in the palace
gardens Here the Seine and there the cypress trees and how it
bored me Thought pure thought flashed clear as water all
around me and all I could think about was how to make a Caesar
of a monkish husband Id like to hear the old man talk again
Id listen now For my ambitions thin with age and all the
mysteries are as plump as ever

(Looking up at GEOFFREY)
I read minds In yours a shapely hand is writing Clever
Mother whats your clever reason for this clever talk It
isnt clever but youll make it so

(She reaches up gently touches his cheek)
I am so sick of all of you

misplaced elements and then oh Henry then Id make some
sense Id be a Queen in Arcady and not an animal in chaos

113 EXT COURTYARD

(Cut to HENRY bounding down the broad stone steps

to the courtyard He passes the camera moving out

of the picture as ALAIS appears at the top of the

steps hesitates again then hurries after him

Dawn is 15 minutes off The light is stronger and
oS) the day is going to be clear)

114 (The camera turns and we watch them moving through
the yard The GROUP OF CAROLERS wanders blearily
in the picture its a bit too early in the day for
singing We lose HENRY and ALAIS as for a moment
we follow the CAROLERS along leaving them as we
pick up on ELEANOR in a corner of the yard She
carries a biggish Christmas present which had we
time to view it closely would look the least bit
hastily rewrapped Her GUARD follows along

behind)

GUARD He is very close to her now She nods
They exchange a look of understanding The GUARD
draws a short blunt heavy dagger and starts 4
stealthily forward

(We see them all ELEANOR tensely watching her
’ GUARD edging forward pressed along the curving
wall the SOLDIER in the recess unaware but
listening

’ (Eleanors GUARD stops just before the recess He
crouches ready to leap Both he and the SOLDIER
wear armor from the waist up The GUARD raises
dagger His armor squeaks

(The SOLDIER spins at the sound The GUARD leaps
His knife flashes down glancing harmlessly on the
SOLDIERS armor

(They face each other in the confines of the
recess There is no room They feint armor
making the moves heavy and slow The SOLDIER
lunges His dagger slides and scrapes along the
GUARDS armor searching for a point of entry
© The only sounds are natural ones grunts heavy
breathing the clank and rattle of armor the
squeal of dagger points on steel

(Its all so clumsy Every move is graceless
Nothing works The walls keep getting in the way
they wheeze and stumble It is ludicrous - and it
is this that gives the fight its special horror

(Eleanors GUARD is thrown clear of the recess He
lunges back They fall rolling and clanking about k
in the shadowed niche Slow-moving arms and i
thrashing legs J

herself to watch There is a strangled cry One

pair of legs goes into spasm She goes on watching y
as her GUARD rises keys to the door in hand

out asleep RICHARD apparently placid lies
