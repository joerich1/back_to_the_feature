voices

INT HELICOPTER - NIGHT (FEB ‘95)

Jordan drooling and stoned out of his skull wears a
rumpled custom-made business suit as he mans a set of
controls next to his frantic co-pilot CAPTAIN DAVE

CAPTAIN DAVE
Pull up Jesus We’re gonna
crash

Jordan’s head bobs as he pulls back on the stick

The helicopter rises sharply then levels out hovering
30 feet above a huge mansion Down below through
Jordan’s hazy DOUBLE VISIONED POV we see a sparkling
pool tennis court and waterfall

JORDAN (VO)
Check this out -- despite my
completely fucked-up state I
could fly straight while still
seeing two of everything

He closes one eye his POV sharpens Putting pressure on
the stick the helicopter descends slowly over the
driving range then LURCHES and SLAMS to the ground

absolute favorite

a credit card to cut a line of coke on his desk As he
peels a crisp 100 DOLLAR BILL off a wad rolls it up

JORDAN
Enough of this shit’1ll make you
invincible able to conquer the
world and eviscerate your enemies

He SNARFS up the line gestures to the cocaine

JORDAN (CONTD)

I’m not talking about this I’m
talking about this

(Jordan unfurls the

100 with a SNAP)
Money is the oxygen of capitalism
and I wanna breathe more than any
other human being alive

He crumbles it into a ball and tosses it into a corner
where it comes to rest with two dozen others Over his
back as we TRACK HIM out of his office toward what sounds
like the ROAR of a mob--

JORDAN (VO)
Money doesn’t just buy you a
better life -- better food better
cars better pussy -- it also
makes you a better person You
can give generously to the church
of your choice or the political
party You can save the fucking
spotted owl with money

MARK HANNA
OK first rule of Wall Street
Nobody -- and I don’t care if
youre Warren Buffet or Jimmy
Buffet -- nobody knows if a
stock’s going up down or fucking
sideways least of all stock
brokers But we have to pretend
we know Make sure you stay
relaxed Nobody wants to buy
something from someone who sounds
like they haven’t gotten laid in a
month Take breaks when you feel
stressed jerk off if you can
You like jerking off right

JORDAN
Well sure

MARK HANNA
Good jerking off is key And I
highly recommend cocaine which
will make you dial faster which
is good for me Churn ‘em and
burn ‘em baby

Gets to business

more than five stocks per year

cutting edge tech firm out of the
Midwest awaiting imminent patent
approval on a new generation of
radar equipment

LATER Now all the Brokers listen in rapt attention

The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3513 15

JORDAN (CONT’D)
-- so if Aerotyne’s shares rise

to only a dollar -- and our
research indicates they could go
much much higher -- your profit

on a mere three thousand dollar
investment would be upwards of

fifty thousand That’s right
you could pay off your mortgage

Seconds tick by an eternity then he starts writing

JORDAN (CONTD)
Four thousand dollars will
that be check or money order
Thank you sir

Jordan hangs up scrawls out a “buy” ticket

In military terms it’s like carpet-
bombing -- noisy menacing and
only marginally effective As
Stratton brokers you will be laser-
guided smart-bombs aimed at high-
priority targets You will
establish an initial relationship
with your clients selling only
blue chip stocks -- then and only
then will you attempt to sell the
pink sheets where the real money
is Now the key to every sale is
this

Jordan writes the word “URGENCY” on the board

JORDAN (CONTD)
No one buys stock unless he thinks
it’s going up and going up now
You must convince your client to
buy before the takeover happens
before the lawsuit is settled
before the patent is granted
If he says Ill think about it and
call you back it’s over you’re
dead No one calls back So you
have to create urgency --

Madden and the wonderful Mary Lou

Huge applause with stomping feet howling etc

JORDAN (CONTD)
Okay now that you got that out
of your system I want you to know
why Steve is so completely off the
fucking wall It’s because this
man is a creative genius Steves
power his gift -- is that he
creates trends Artists like
Steve come along once a century

stock could go The 20s The
50s The 80s

Applause war whoops Jordan motions for quiet

JORDAN (CONTD)
I want everybody to look down
See that little black box in front
of you Its called a telephone
Now Im gonna let you in ona
little secret about this
telephone -- it wont dial itself
That’s right -- until you take
some action its nothing more
than a worthless hunk of plastic
like a loaded M16 without a
trained Marine to pull the
trigger And in the case of the
telephone its the action of you
a highly trained Strattonite a
killer who will not take no for an
answer A person who will not
hang up the phone until his client
either buys or fucking dies

The Brokers go crazy Jordan looks around

I dont care if you graduated from
Harvard or Bumfuck University or
never got past fourth fucking

equalizer

Brokers go nuts fighting over it like a home-run ball

JORDAN (CONTD)
And if anyone here thinks Im
crazy get the fuck out and get a
job at McDonald’s because thats
where you fucking belong But
before you depart this room full
of winners I want you to take a
good look at the person next to
you because one day in the not-so-
distant future youll be sitting
at a red light in your beat-up old
Pinto and that person’s gonna
pull up in a brand new Porsche
with their gorgeous young wife at
their side And who will you be
next to Some ugly beast with
three days of razor-stubble ina
sleeveless moo-moo crammed in
next to you with a carload of
groceries from the fucking Price
Club

He scans the Brokers they’re on the edge of their seats

JORDAN (CONTD)
So you listen to me and listen
carefully Are you behind on your
credit card bills Good Pick up

your landlord threatening to evict
you Good Pick up the phone and
start dialing Does your
girlfriend think youre a fucking
loser Pick up the phone and

you to deal with your problems by

gotta find it Have a seat will

six

JORDAN
I mean one like this Just had

Jordan points out the Bell-Jet helicopter
AGENT DENHAM
Never been on a boat with a second
mode of transportation on top of
it

Jordan finds the file he’s been looking for offers it
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3513

AGENT DENHAM (CONTD)
(before he’ll accept)
What is this

JORDAN

Names and addresses of every guest
at my wedding Friends clients I
even threw in the seating chart
Heard that’s why you wanted the
video figured this’d expedite
whatever it is you’re doing

(Denham looks it’s

indeed a guest list

from the wedding)
I wanted to show you I’ve got
nothing to hide I know you’re
investigating Stratton but for the
life of me I can’t figure out why
Sure my company is unorthodox
what brokerage isn’t Maybe we’re
a little louder than most but we
don’t do anything illegal Talk to
the SEC they’11 tell you they
checked us out up and down

AGENT DENHAM
The SEC’s actually a civil
regulatory agency We pursue
criminal activity

JORDAN
That’s what I’m saying You guys
take on real crime Which is why
I’m so curious what do you think
we did

The reason Jordan asked him here Denham realizes

AGENT DENHAM
I can’t discuss ongoing
investigations

JORDAN
I understand

AGENT DENHAM
Though to be frank this case
kinda got dumped on my desk Some
higher-up felt your shop needed
looking into after all that press
fell on me to do the looking

JORDAN
You know who you should be looking
at Goldman Lehman Brothers

The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3513 76

JORDAN (CONTD)
What those guys’re up to with
collateralized debt obligations
This internet stock bullshit
C’mon If you want I’1l walk you
through exactly --

AGENT DENHAM
-- that’d be great And if there’s
anything you can give me just to
close out your file get it off my

desk--

JORDAN
-- sure get you back to the real
criminals --

AGENT DENHAM
-- then we could both profit from
this little sit-down

Jordan sizes him up what did Denham mean by “profit”

JORDAN

You sure you don’t want anything
to drink Water for your pal

(Denham demurs )
Rumor is your started out in
finance Even got your broker’s
license before you joined the
bureau

AGENT DENHAM
Who told you that

JORDAN

(searches his memory)
Jeez who was it

(comes up short)
Ever regret it Giving up the
money-crazed pin-striped life
Ever think where youd be if you’d
stuck with it

AGENT DENHAM
When I’m riding the subway home
sweating my balls off in a suit
I’ve worn three days sure

JORDAN
Whattaya pull in working at the
bureau if you don’t mind me
asking 50-60K a year

AGENT DENHAM
Just about We get a free handgun
out of it though that doesn’t
suck
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3513

JORDAN
S‘crazy the world we live in the
jobs with real value the ones we
should appreciate -- firefighters
teachers FBI agents -- those are
the ones we pay the least

AGENT DENHAM
Way of the world

JORDAN

That’s one thing I like about what
I do the opportunity to make that
right Take this kid we had
interning last year Didn’t want
to be a broker wanted to be an
environmental scientist or
something he had a student loan
debts up to his eyeballs Anyway
his mom gets sick all they can
afford is third-rate care Some of
us got together made an
investment on his behalf and --
boom -- overnight everything
changes she’s seeing the best
doctors in the country Sadly
didn’t work out she passed but
still having the power to do that
makes all the other bullshit worth
while

(as Denham considers

that)
See it’s all about proper
guidance Pat Knowing someone
with the right relationships
who’s discreet I can change a
life almost every day

They measure each other

AGENT DENHAM
How much that intern make off your
deal

JORDAN
North of half a million

Denham summons Agent Hughes over To Jordan

AGENT DENHAM

Can you say that again what you
told me

(Jordan declines with

a smile to Agent

Hughes )
I believe Mr Belfort just tried
to bribe a federal officer
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3513

JORDAN
What I was making conversation

AGENT DENHAM
Sounds like that to me Jordan

JORDAN
no no no

AGENT DENHAM
sounded like that

JORDAN

no to constitute a bribe
don’t I have to make an explicit
offer of money for services With
an exact dollar figure attached
All I said was “north” of half a
million According to the US
Criminal Code that dog won’t
hunt Pat

(then)
Heard you were a straight arrow
That you wouldn’t bend the rules
other agents might He was right

AGENT DENHAM
You did a background check on me

JORDAN
Figured you were looking into me
was only fair Plus you sail ona
yacht fit for a Bond villain
sometimes you gotta act the part

AGENT DENHAM
This is why you invited me down to
your yacht With a couple hookers
on it --

JORDAN
-- those are friends --

AGENT DENHAM
-- to get a sense of the guy who
was coming after you

Jordan puts his hands up “you got me”

JORDAN
Thanks for coming down Now get
off my boat

jackasses I bust they were born

absolutely certain we’ll see each
other again

(before he does)
You know this is about the nicest
boat I’ve ever been on Just think
what a hero I’1l be in the office
when the bureau seizes it

Jordan watches him go temper flaring he can’t let
Denham get the final word He calls after them

JORDAN
Hey Denham I’m gonna eat a claw
of lobster now as I get my cock
sucked by Heidi down below You
have a super ride home on the
subway thinking about that

As he watches them pull away seething --

He was a numbers guy a follow-the-

INT BANQUE REAL DE GENEVE - SAUREL’S OFFICE - DAY

Jordan Rugrat and Donnie drink coffee with Saurel and
one other SWISS BANKER It’s an impressive office with
an enormous fish tank

DONNIE
We have a joke in America
“Heaven is a place where the
police are Brits the chefs are
Italian the car mechanics are
German the prostitutes are French
and the bankers are Swiss” I
never got it ‘til now -- look at
those fucking fish Come here
little guy

SAUREL
Yes we have the same joke here
Only sometimes the English are
chauffeurs and the chefs are
French The Germans alas are
always mechanics no one wants to
grant them more authority than
that

Polite laughter Jordan not as impressed by the fish
cuts straight to the point

JORDAN
Im curious about your bank
secrecy laws

SAUREL
Excusez-moi Jordan Swiss custom
requires ten minutes of idle chit-
chat before business can be
discussed
(a smile)

Of course let’s get “down to it”
What would you like to know

JORDAN
Under what circumstances would you
be obligated to cooperate with an
FBI or US Justice Department
investigation

SAUREL
Ca depend

JORDAN

The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages 3513

SAUREL
Whether America plans to invade
Switzerland in the coming months

RUGRAT
Want me to see if tanks are
rolling down the Rue de la Croix

More chuckles Through Jordan’s forced smile

JORDAN (VO)
What I’m asking you Swiss dick
is are you going to fuck me over

SAUREL (VO)
I understand perfectly you
American shitheel

Saurel smiles

SAUREL
The only way the Banque Real de
Geneve would cooperate with a
foreign legal body is if the crime
being pursued also happened to be
a crime in Switzerland But there
are very few Swiss laws pertaining
to your “rumored” improprieties
Which is why Mr Azoff’s joke is
most appropriate from a financial
standpoint you are now in heaven
and we welcome you If the US
Justice Department or FBI or SEC
or IRS sent us a subpoena it
would become papier-toillette We
would wipe our ass with it

Everyone’s impressed Except Jordan

JORDAN
Unless it was an investigation
into stock fraud -- which is a

crime in Switzerland Then youd
have to cooperate

SAUREL
(now he’s impressed)
Yes we would Assuming the
account is under your name
However if it were in the name of
a nominee of yours

this -- Stratton Oakmont is bigger
than any one person even me
Especially me You guys are

you and that is why it’s sure to
remain the best brokerage firm in
the fucking world

Thunderous applause spreads through the boardroom all

that when you come here and step
into this bullpen for the first
time you start your life anew
You have a place here and no one
can take that away from you
Stratton Oakmont is America Give
me your tired and poor The very
moment you walk through that door
and pledge your loyalty to this

beautiful woman who drives a brand
new Mercedes a woman who lives in

Armani suits who spends her
winters in the Bahamas and her
summers in the Hamptons

fine I’d have to pay wouldn’t be
