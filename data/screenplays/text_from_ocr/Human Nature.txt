INT POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Its going to be a long night

LILA
Â»a jail called the human body

The lascivious cop smiles lasciviously at Lilas
to human body
LILA
My soul held prisoner in this reeking
stench-ridden bag of bones and
entrails A bag of feces and piss
and fibroid cysts in my tits and
precancerous moles on my sun-damaged

The lascivious cop gags then vomits on the floor Lila
on her cigarette calmer now
LILA
At least now Ill be able to blame

the state not God for my
incarceration

PUFF
I am sorry gentlemen sorry for all
of us Yours is a complicated sad
world

This is a revelation to the assembled crowd People
to each other

PUFF
And I never knew that I was living
a life of simplicity of purity
when I was ripped out of my Eden and
immersed in this harshness Some
would argue that the life I was living
was not a human life at all And
gentlemen I dont have any clever
retort I am not a philosopher The
only thing I know is that I am sorry
sorry for my expulsion from Eden
sorry for my Lila rotting in her
jail cell and sorry for Nathan
rotting in his grave

INT WHITE SPACE - DAY

Nathan thirties in a white robe sits alone at a
table Everything is white except for an oozing bullet
in Nathans temple

NATHAN

I dont even know what sorry means
anymore Its odd When I was alive
I knew -- maybe it was all I knew --
but here sorry is meaningless Love
is meaningless Jealousy is
meaningless Ambition is meaningless
Everything that motivated my every
breath while I was alive is
meaningless now

I have to say I always hated apes

Of course I dont any longer I dont

We must never act like apes son
For you see The ape is our closest
biological relative -- specifically

A single chromosome separates us
But you know what truly separates us
from the apes what makes us better

looks at various old portraits of men She studies
their

facial hair When she turns a corner she is shocked to
see

a large Renaissance painting of a naked woman entirely
covered

with fur She hurries to it She looks at the placard
next

to the painting It is a painting of Mary Magdalene
LILA (VO)
I remember once coming across a
painting of Mary Magdalene entirely
covered with fur I guess thats
where I got the idea that maybe the
Catholic Church might be a place
that encouraged excessive hair growth
in its women

LILA
Last night I almost died on this
mountain top and the irony is I had
never felt more alive

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

There is a violent violent storm The hair drier drone
turned into the explosive noise of rain beating down in

Lilas tent blows over revealing her huddled there
sleeping bag wrapped around her like a blanket

LILA
I knew it was coming when in late
afternoon a thunderhead drifted
over sneaking in like kids through
the back door of a movie theater
forced casual It turned the sky a
queer shade of green A green that
said watch out baby this is gonna
hurt like hell I couldve
hightailed but that would be
cheating Part of the Nature
experience is recognizing its mastery
over you your smallness in the face
of it

I had to have a man in my life
At any cost I would become what I

Thank you so much I love slugs All
slugs not just banana slugs

NATHAN
As do I

LILA
Theyre so even keel They forge

driven this is true

LILA
Youve got to respect that

I have to say that Im not there

LILA
Where

NATHAN
Slugdom Sluggishness Whatever youd
call it Im not there yet I still
have many human characteristics

LILA
Thats not necessarily a bad thing

NATHAN
Yes I suppose not But still One
would like to move along To move
beyond

LILA
Im not sure we can escape our
natures Believe me Ive tried Im
not even so sure anymore that we
should want to

NATHAN

I love that you said that It makes
me feel a bit lighter Ive been
rather heavy lately Thinking about
my childhood Realizing how much a
product I am of my upbringing

You are a therapist right

Quite well really Its a lot of
work A lot of reinforcement mostly
positive Right now Ive gotten two
of my subjects to use napkins Tiny
napkins of course

LILA
Paper or cloth

NATHAN
I hope you dont think me daft Its
important work Its part of a larger
sociological experiment Im federally
funded

LILA
Whats the larger experiment

NATHAN
Its my thesis that if table manners
can be taught to mice they can be
taught to humans

LILA
Going out on a limb arent you
Nathan

NATHAN

(speech)
The truth is most people dont have
table manners today And when the
foundations of civilized society
crumble and disappear civilized
society in its entirely follows
closely at its heels
LILA
Im not sure

NATHAN
(stridently)
Courtesy decorum manners are all
sadly lacking from our daily
intercourse Rudeness vulgarity
meanness are the norm

LILA
We are animals after all

NATHAN
Ergo if I can teach table manners to
mice I can teach them to humans If
I can teach table manners to humans
I can save the world

forks of varying size under Lucite domes

Nathan nods to his pretty French assistant Gabrielle

presses a button The Lucite domes over the salads

Tentatively both mice reach for a fork There is a tiny
of velcro on each mouses paw and a tiny piece of

each of the forks The first mouse picks the correct
and stabs it into the salad and eats happily relieved
second mouse picks the wrong fork Nathan presses a
which sends the mouse flying off his chair with an
shock The correct mouse keeps eating unconcerned
makes a note in his notebook

Gabrielle watches Nathan as he writes enchanted

nothing more than a messy
conglomeration of need desperation
fear of death insecurity about penis
size and the self-involved ego
driven need to collect other peoples
hearts Not that I judge it

something I hadnt seen since my

live in the woods because theyre
anti-social Lila We have to respect
that

Lila trudges through the brush Nathan follows Better
being left behind

This is the way to get ticks Lila

This is it Bingo Lyme Disease

Youve hit the nail on the head here

Lila is in her element Her whole demeanor has changed

She is tracking She sniffs the breeze cocks her head
stealthily Then she sheds her clothes almost shaking
off like a dog shaking off some cute costume his owner
dressed him in

direction but not seeing us The sun dapples her body

She moves closer and closer

PUFF (VO)
It was an ape as I had never seen
before Like me yet different in
certain essential details And all
at once I felt a heat pass through
me My heart raced Gentlemen I
wanted to touch her to caress her
to be one with her I had urges and
desires I could not explain I felt
overwhelmed by the power this strange
creature had over me and so I did

Im about to do kill you is
something that would never have
occurred to me to do as a creature

it was for food or in self-defense

prowess and their fancy gourmet foods
that theyve forgotten to look to
the Earth as a teacher This is

destruction and betrayal is proof of
that I will keep my promise to Lila
