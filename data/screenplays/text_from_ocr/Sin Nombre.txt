Forward Note

This is an English Version of the script The Shooting
Script is in colloquial Spanish

An urban style of slang has been used here with members
of a gang called the Mara Salvatrucha which is heavily
influenced by its counterparts in the United States The
Spanish version reflects this particular style of speech

For the Immigrants the Spanish reflects the grammar and
vocabulary used in the regions of the Americas that they
come from

EXT COLONIA CONFETI TAPACHULA - DAY
SUPER TAPACHULA MEXICO

A weathered yet serene poster of a green landscape (Texas)
fills our frame We pan around revealing EL CASPER a gaunt-
faced 17 year-old wiping water from his face He stares at
the image with a curious indifference it’s hard to read what
he thinks

Behind him a slum like neighborhood of one-story concrete
homes that resembles a favela linked with the familiar maze
of paths scavenged roofs and satellite dishes powered by
dangerously improvised cables

His cell phone BEEPS He finishes washing his face and head
and leaves

EXT COLONIA CONFETI STREET - DAY

Casper walks briskly down the street People give hima
respectful amount of space We see more details of his body
a tattoo on his neck “perdoname madre mia” and a TEAR DROP is
on his right eye the shape of a pistol in his back pocket

INT COMBI (MINIBUS) - DAY

A combi pulls up to a line of 8 waiting PASSENGERS Casper
walks past them and sits in the front seat with the driver
The driver hands him a wad of CASH with out saying a word
nor Casper look at him At the next stop lined with 5
waiting passengers Casper gets down

EXT COLONIA CONFETI STREET - CONTINUOUS

Casper passes THREE fellow FOOT SOLDIERS of his gang Long
rifles lean against a wall next to them as they lounge in the
hot sun watching the border of their territory He picks up
one of their bikes and rides down the blocks

He arrives at a corner MINI-MARKET again silently collecting
cash from the WOMAN running it

EXT COLONIA CONFETI STREETS - DAY

El Casper rides a bike through the maze weaving around
pedestrians and vendors

He pauses on his bike A train passes in front of him
THREE similarly tattooed men ride atop they acknowledge
Casper with nods

CUT TO

Casper rides into another alley and stops in front of an 2A
unremarkable concrete house A television blasts a Game Show
inside while an ancient woman ABUE cools off next to the

window She eats raisins from a bowl El Casper takes one

and eats it with out asking charmingly

EL CASPER
Senora

She looks at El Casper disapprovingly then makes an
incomprehensible call into the house

A BOY 12 appears wearing a tattered middle-school uniform
He sees El Casper and motions for him to come in

INT SMILEY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 2B

The boy hands him a backpack unceremoniously it’s an old
routine

El Casper checks the contents of the backpack CD players
Gameboys radios batteries headphones and other random
stolen goods He nods approvingly then notices a slim
DIGITAL CAMERA He picks it up inspects it then stuffs it
in his own pocket before zipping up the bag El Casper holds
his finger up to his mouth

EL CASPER (CONTD)
Shhh our secret

The boy nods

EL CASPER
Lil’ Mago wants to see you

EXT EL LIL MAGO’S HOUSE BACK PATIO 3

The KID stands before EL LIL MAGO a striking man in his
early-twenties with a face covered in MARA SALVATRUCHA
tattoos crowned with “devil’s horns” scrawled in detail on
his forehead About a DOZEN other similarly clad GANG
MEMBERS including El Casper stand around him

The Kid nervously pulls at his tattered school pants Lil’
Mago smiles
EL LIL MAGO
One

El Casper and TWO other men El Smokey a teen with crazy
eyes and EL BOMBA a hefty Guatemalan in his late-twenties
jump up and begin beating the boy EL SOL mid-twenties
stoic watches from behind

The boy tries to fight back spinning around in a fury of
punches and kicks but is no match to the three men’s
experience He is quickly pummeled to the ground

EL LIL MAGO (CONTD)
Four five Five Five and
half Six

He is knocked again and again all he can do is protect his
face

EL LIL MAGO (CONTD)
enine ten eleven eleven
twelve

El Casper looks at El Lil Mago waiting for “thirteen” The
Boys face is cut and his left eyelid sags El Casper only
halfheartedly punches him now

EL LIL MAGO (CONTD)
Twelve

El Casper feels El Lil Mago glaring at him so he launches a
kick into the boys chest The boy YELPS as El Casper kicks
him over and over

EL LIL MAGO (CONTD)
Thirteen

El Casper finally stops breathing heavily Despite his
tears whimpers and quivering body the Boy forms a smile --
a crying smile

El Lil Mago pulls him up The men HOLLER as they rush in
throwing Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) gang signs (M” then “S”
shapes with their hands) and stacking those with their
clica’s name “CONFETI LOCOS” in a form of sign-language
They hug him

EL LIL MAGO (CONTD)
Look at this kid Casper he’s all
smiles
EXT COLONIA STAIRWAY - TEGUCIGALPA HONDURAS - DAY
SUPER TEGUCIGALPA HONDURAS

We see a large expanse of the capitol and its foothills A
city covered with colorful homes patches of tropical green
and smog

On the bottom of the frame THREE ADOLESCENT GIRLS make their
way up a long set of stairs towards us sharing a cigarette

SAYRA 15 an olive-skinned girl with long hair and bright
eyes stands between CLARISSA and YAMILA

CLARISSA
Youre so lucky Sayra
(BEAT)
If my Dad came back to take me
north with him

SAYRA
Mine didn’t he was deported

CLARISSA
And At least he can make the
journey with you instead of paying
a pervy pollero to take you
(BEAT)
Yamila’s dad was a pervy pollero
from what her mom remembers

Yamila cigarette in mouth gives Clarissa the finger

CLARISSA
(to Sayra)

Look I don’t even know why you’re
wetting your pants over this it’s
not like your Grandma wants to take
care of your ass anymore And if
Orlando goes You should get the
hell out of here while you can

SAYRA
(sarcasticly)
And leave this

CLARISSA
Pendeja

YAMILA
I wish I could go with you
4h

5A

Yamila hugs Sayra firmly

YAMILA
Ill pray for you

Sayra and Clarissa continue on we linger for a moment on
Yamila who sadly watches them walk away She finishes off
the butt and drops it to the ground

We pan away from her to catch up to Sayra and Clarissa as
they enter their neighborhood past vendors CAT-CALLING BOYS
who they give the finger and soccer playing children

Sayra and Clarissa climb into the room from a window They 4A
laugh as they fall to the floor--

INT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 5

--landing on a stained mattress half covered with a worn
flower print sheet in a tiny sparse room with two other
similar mattress on the floor Clothes sheets and blankets
sit in tidy piles along the walls

ORLANDO 19 Sayra’s almost equal in age Uncle waits for her
in the room He has kind eyes but you can tell he’s
irritated with her She reacts shrugging in a “what do you
expect” kind of way

ORLANDO
He’s here

Clarissa trips over a BACKPACK Sayra quickly stuffs it
under a shelf

ORLANDO
Come on
(BEAT)
We have a front door you know

Sayra trips Orlando sweeping his back leg just as he
stumbles into the NEXT ROOM a compact concrete space that
doubles as a kitchen and a bedroom The girls try to contain
their laughter before entering Sayra pauses her mood
shifts she looks nervously at Clarissa To comfort her
Clarissa presses their foreheads together

The next room -- serious faced Sayra looks around an old 5A
woman NANA glares up at her Lying on a blanket covered

couch her sick eyes guide us to a some seats where Orlando

sits down abruptly next to his pregnant girlfriend CECI

19 and
HORACIO mid-thirties Bushy eye-brows and weathered face in
mid-conversation with Nana

He sees Sayra his eyes redden as he stands sniffing and
wiping his nose gruffly

Sayra stops in the doorway Clarissa hovers behind her
Horacio opens his arms gesturing for her to hug him

HORACIO
If I didn’t know I wouldn’t
recognize her

Sayra stays in the doorway crosses her arms and waits

ORLANDO
Go on

Horacio indicates again he’s waiting for her to hug him

HORACIO
(trying hard)
Youre all like a real woman

She relents approaches and sticks out her hand ina
cordial but cold handshake Horacio reciprocates warily

NANA
She’s done nothing but talk about
you

Appalled and embarrassed Sayra retreats

NANA
You’1l1 have lots of time together
now

HORACIO
I wish Mami but with Yessenia
alone with the kids we’ll leave
tomorrow on the congolodn

NANA
So Soon You can’t stay longer
(to Sayra)
You packed
SAYRA
No
NANA

Then you better get started
SAYRA
I don’t want to go

This comes as a shock

NANA
The hell you don’t

SAYRA
I never said I’d go for sure

The entire room breaks into noise

NANA
It’s what’s best

SAYRA
I don’t want to go with him Do
you want me to leave Nana

The old woman doesn’t exactly say no it’s pretty clear she’d
rather the girl left Sayra looks around the room The
attention and pressure infuriates and hurts her

Sayra walks out of the house Suddenly Clarissa is left
behind awkwardly in the room -- she turns and looks at
Orlando

EXT TAPACHULA TRAIN YARD (AKA LA BOMBILLA) MEXICO - DAY

The train yard populated with about 50 CENTRAL AMERICAN
IMMIGRANTS has four tracks and an abandoned passenger
platform

El Casper and the boy now known as SMILEY sit on the
platform El Casper visibly bored watches over the
immigrants like a shepherd Smiley copies Casper whenever he
adjusts his sitting position

LUCRESIA a transvestite with boxer shorts hiked up over a
tight T-shirt and a bucket balanced on her head saunters by
She has a sassy sense of humor with rapid-fire responses to
anyone who makes a comment to her

She notices Smiley -- the “new” member and makes a sarcastic
comment Casper ignores her but notices she is also selling
COLORFUL FELT FLOWERS from a plastic bag

His cell phone BEEPS He pulls out the phone Text message
ONDE STAS He stuffs the phone back in his pocket eager it
seems to move
Casper whistles at Lucresia calling her over

EXT COLONIA CONFETI BRIDGE - TAPACHULA MEXICO - DAY

El Casper and Smiley walk across a metal bridge spanning an
oily creek filled with garbage

On the other side FOUR kids fish despite the pollution One
of them is drawing an MS13 “X3” on the bridge

KIDS
Casper

They jump up and flash the gang’s sign El Casper kicks one
of them in the butt then hurries on

EXT MARKET HILL CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY

He starts to climb through the window of a simple looking one-
story house but stops and turns around to Smiley

EL CASPER
Wait here

SMILEY
How long El Lil Mago said we
were supposed to stay in La
Bombilla-

EL CASPER
-Not long

He climbs into the window

INT BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

A 15 year-old girl MARTHA MARLEN lies sleeping on a couch
Casper admires her peaceful smooth face sleepy eyes
sweating beading on her forehead

He gently sits down next to her and leans forward but before
he can kiss her she awakens laying out a barrage of slaps
and catching him by surprise

EL CASPER
Stop it What are you doing

He grabs her flailing hands and forces her back falling on
top of her

MARTHA MARLEN
Get off of me

EL CASPER
You going to calm down

MARTHA MARLEN
You better get off of me or I’1l
scream I swear to God I will

Faking like she’s going to scream El Casper covers her mouth
with his They give each other one long wet kiss

MARTHA MARLEN (CONT’D)
I still hate you

El Casper reaches around to his back pocket and pulls out the
nylon flowers

Martha Marlen’s eyes light up She takes the flowers and
pushes El Casper off of her disappearing into the living
roomkitchen

He can hear her fiddling with a bucket of water

EL CASPER
(El Casper yells to her)
They don’t need water

She comes back in holding the flowers in the cup

MARTHA MARLEN
I know

She sets them down next to her bed El Casper watches her
adoringly She catches him smiles then pulls off his
hoodie and shirt all at once

His body is covered in the same tattoos as El Lil Mago the
three points of la vida loca on his hand a rosary around his
wrist “perdoname madre mia” on his neck and over his heart a
still raw “Martha Marlen”

He hugs her tight breathing in her scent then pulls her
down to him and rolling on top of her They kiss again
EXT MARTHA MARLEN’S HOUSE - DAY

Smiley tries to look through the window but can barely hold

himself up long enough to see El Casper and Martha Marlen
moving sexually on her bed

He slips down he eagerly tries to pull himself back up but
is too weak from the baptism He sits down disappointed

EXT ROOF TOP - TEGUCIGALPA HONDURAS - DUSK 11

Sayra watches the movements of the city from this vantage
point Orlando approaches her from behind She says nothing
to him

He sits down quietly appreciating the view

SAYRA
They’re going to build a golf
course there

You like golf

ORLANDO

SAYRA

ORLANDO

ORLANDO

She shrugs

ORLANDO
Come with us I know it won’t be
easy there either but at least
youll have us There’s nothing
for you here Nothing

She grinds the ground with her shoes

SAYRA
If I went it wouldn’t be for him
and it wouldn’t be for you neither
It would be for me I’d make my
own decisions

ORLANDO
Fine

SAYRA
Alright then I’11 think about it
You can tell him that

The first sharp BRASS notes of “CANCION MIXTECA” played by a
ragged brass band key-noted with a MARIMBA echo over the HUM
of a river

EXT SUCHIATE RIVER - GUATEMALA - DAY

SUPER 3 DAYS LATER 1800 MILES SOUTH OF THE US BORDER
Left side SUPER TECUN UMAN GUATEMALA

Right side SUPER CIUDAD HIDALGO MEXICO

Nothing more than a brown 200 yard wide river divides the
two countries We pan down from the landscape to a birds-eye
perspective of the river

The source of the key notes in the music floats onto
screen A MARIMBA (looks like an oversized xylophone)
played by TWO MEN on a raft made of intertubes and wooden
palettes

FOUR similar rafts float into view The ones moving right
are cramped with people -- the ones moving left product
BOYS with long poles push the rafts forward

We move towards one of those rafts with people where
everyone except for Sayra stares eagerly at the coming
Mexican shore She stares at the surreal looking MARIMBA
raft

Horacio sits on the front of the raft His bushy eyebrows
drip sweat as he joins Orlando in prayer

HORACIO and ORLANDO
Amen

Horacio crosses his chest and looks back at his daughter who
seems to ignore them both

Their raft wobbles before it hits the shore she clenches the
wooden boards her knuckles whiten Horacio steps off and
turns to help Sayra but she still sits with her back to
them frozen

He turns and walks away along with Orlando Sayra notices
they aren’t waiting for her She stands awkwardly and runs
to join them

EXT CIUDAD HIDALGO - CONTINUOUS 13

Sayra catches up to Horacio and Orlando who stand frozen in
front of TWO JUDICIAL POLICE OFFICERS

JUDICIAL OFFICER 1
Welcome to Mexico Papers

The officers grab the three of them by the neck and force
them into a concrete building

INT CONCRETE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 14

SEVERAL other nervous IMMIGRANTS sit on the floor in front of
another JUDICIAL OFFICER

HORACIO
(whispering)
Don’t worry well be okay

SAYRA and ORLANDO do not look convinced They are petrified

JUDICIAL OFFICER 2
Okay friends first you will empty
your pockets of any and all forms
of money and valuables Then you
will take each item of clothing off
and place it on the floor in front
of you Start with your shoes

They hesitate Judicial Officer 1 knocks an IMMIGRANT MAN
in the head

They all strip quickly to their underwear as the Judicial
Officers rifle through their clothes cutting open seams and
opening their bags to collect their money

Horacio looks at his cut clothes with steaming anger
Embarrassed Sayra covers herself as best she can

INT MARTHA MARLEN’S BEDROOM - DAY

Martha Marlen and El Casper (known as Willy to her) lay half-
naked in bed El Casper takes photographs of her with the
digital camera Martha Marlen is shy she holds her hands up
defending herself from the lens but secretly is amused with
it

El Casper adjusts the BLACK STRINGED NECKLACE wooden tablet
with SAINT ANTHONY skirting her collarbone then snaps
another

He lays down next to her to inspect the photos Her finger
caresses his tattoos while he figures out how to replay the
images

MARTHA MARLEN
Willy will you give me one too

EL CASPER
No

MARTHA MARLEN
No Why not

EL CASPER

MARTHA MARLEN
Do you have another girl in your
hood

EL CASPER
What No Of course not

MARTHA MARLEN
If I find out you do I swear to
God

Martha Marlen makes a scissors sign with her hand looking
down at his privates She giggles

EL CASPER
What

MARTHA MARLEN
You’re shrinking

El Casper looks down at his privates and shrugs He turns a
little red but overcompensates when he says

EL CASPER
It’s natural It’1l come back

He pins her down and starts kissing her again quickly
snapping another photo
EXT COLONIA CONFETI BRIDGE - DAY

It’s late in the day as El Casper and Smiley walk back into
Colonia Confeti

SMILEY
So does she have a friend for me

Casper stops Smiley searching for intent in his face as if
he meant it as a threat

EL CASPER
You can’t ever tell Lil Mago I
take you to that house understand
No one can know

SMILEY
(intimidated)
Okay-

EL CASPER
-Not a fucking word

Casper lightens up on him

EL CASPER

girl too

EXT CIUDAD HIDALGO COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
Horacio leads a startled if not more vigilant Orlando and
Sayra in a fast march along an irrigation ditch in a green

field Their clothes are stretched and their shoes cut up

Horacio marches on

HORACIO
Now say the number again

EXT EL LIL MAGO’S HOUSE COLONIA CONFETI - DUSK 18

In the cramped alleyways of the colonia El Lil Mago’s house
hums with REGGAETONE BEATS The front yard somehow fits the
moth-balled carcass of an older model American car

Children pretend to drive inside

EL CASPER
Welcome to the destroyer

INT EL LIL’ MAGO’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 19

It’s a grimy home of small concrete rooms poorly organized
and stuffed with detritus The walls look like the grimy
tile of a subway bathroom the rooms contained stained
mattresses and improvised furniture

As El Casper greets the inhabitants all respond with the “M”
S hand signs

EL BOMBA
Sup Casper Did he get a chavala
yet (diecioyo 18th Street Gang)

El Bomba stands over a two range counter top stove warming
corn tortillas Opened cans of vegetables litter the
counter A teenage girl KIMBERLY helps him prepare the
food

Smiley takes in the space while nervously touching the
scabbing marks on his face

He gestures to EL SMOKEY and EL PICARO ironing their clothes
with their shirts off They are covered in tattoos

EL CASPER (CONTD)

in today from San Salvador
Thirsty

El Casper grabs a TAMPICO from a watery bucket in the kitchen
and hands one to Smiley while leading him deeper into the
house there are girls and at least FOUR LITTLE KIDS who
belong to them walking about

EL TURBINO a skinny Mara lays over a chair as El Peluguin
applies a tattoo to him A cigarette dangles from his mouth

EL CASPER (CONTD)
El Turbino ‘cause he smokes like
one

EL PELUQUIN stands over El Turbino hunched like a scare-
crow

EL CASPER (CONTD)
-And El Peluquin He can’t sit
down ‘cause he’s bleeding from the
ass Hemorrhoids

They cross a patio to another room containing a TV and parts
for building pipe guns machetes bats chains and other
sundry weapons At the end of the room an alter to an
unknown Saint is adorned and candled

Smiley points at a chimba a home-made pipe gun

EL CASPER
When you earn it For now you
share like everyone else what’s
from La Mara is for la Mara

In the back room El Sol catches a glimpse of El Casper he
nods to Lil’ Mago

EL CASPER (CONT’D)

El Lil Mago eyes El Casper sadly then turns his attention
back to Smiley

EL LIL MAGO
Well I got a little something for
you anyway Smiley

He leads them back to THE BACK PATIO past a broken SHREK
PINATA on the ground Candy rappers lay scattered about
ONE YOUNG CHILD sits amongst the trash poking around for a
fresh piece of candy

El Lil Mago burps his kid who is starting to pass out on
his shoulder

EL LIL MAGO
Wait here

El Lil Mago and El Casper disappear down a darkened alley
Smiley stands by himself uncomfortably TWO MAREROS play
“paper rock scissors” while another is dry-humping a girl
in a darkened corner

THREE KIDS the same ones who were fishing on the bridge
watch from the top of their neighboring shack They notice
Smiley

back

EXT SHACK ALLEY - DUSK

El Casper leads him through the colonia to a dimly lit shack

El Lil Mago opens the door and turns on his flashlight
Inside a beaten IMMIGRANT is tied up his face covered in
coagulated blood Smiley looks disgusted

EL LIL MAGO
El Sol found him today amongst a
group of pollitos in La
Bombilla

El Casper flashes a look at El Lil Mago who lifts up the
man’s shirt revealing an XVIII tattoo (18th Street) across
his stomach He looks at El Casper and Smiley amused

EL LIL MAGO (CONTD)
This is Mara-land pinche chavala-

BLEEDING IMMIGRANT

I told you I don’t do that shit no
more Please I’m just going
north

EL LIL MAGO
After we kill you we’re going to
cut you up into 18 tiny pieces and
feed you to our dogs

El Lil Mago raises his pistol The man writhes like a
wounded snake to avoid the pistol

BLEEDING IMMIGRANT
Please I have a family I don’t do
that shit no more

Smiley smirks nervously at the man El Casper is stoic he
knows what is about to happen and he doesn’t want to do it
He’s sick of it

El Lil Mago hands him a snub nose 38 SPECIAL Smiley is
surprised He motions to himself as if to say “who me”

EL LIL MAGO
Once a diecioyo always a diecioyo
Smiley Help him Casper

Smiley can only stare at the gun his heart races El Casper
takes it cocks it then places it carefully back in Smileys
hand

EL CASPER
(patiently)

Blood floods towards their feet Smiley only wearing flip-
flops backs up to avoid it El Lil Mago rub’s Smileys head
playfully Smiley is green

EL LIL’ MAGO
Watch the blood run Smiley You

Casper reloads his chimba with another shotgun shell cocks
it

EXT TAPACHULA TRAIN YARD (AKA LA BOMBILLA) - DUSK 21

-BANG Casper’s shot echoes across the train yard --
illuminated by the fading light of day and the radio tower
that casts a blue-green glow over it’s four tracks and
abandoned passenger platform and station

Horacio Orlando and Sayra stumble in exhausted They take
in the space

150 HUNDRED IMMIGRANTS meander in the yard huddling in
groups sitting on the tracks and chatting Some look
exhausted like Sayra and her family some look scared some
look outright scary

Various MEN stare at Sayra and make comments - she’s a stand-
out Horacio glares at them then steers her protectively
towards the abandoned platform

Suddenly the ENTIRE CROWD moves like a school of fish
avoiding danger Horacio turns to see what everyone is
fleeing from It’s nothing TWO STATION SECURITY GUARDS with
SHOTGUNS Those closest calm down Some who ran are
already a hundred feet away

Horacio and Orlando breath a sigh of relief lLucresia
observing the movements of the crowd laughs with another
LOCAL about how the immigrants move like a school of fish
An IMMIGRANT snaps at her she snaps back

EXT ABANDONED STATION PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS 22
Orlando helps Sayra up onto the concrete ledge of the

abandoned station He pulls her shoes off She winces from

the pain Her feet are swollen and blistering

ORLANDO (CONTD)
You just walked too much today

Sayra winces again as he places his bag under her calves

ORLANDO
Let them air out

HORACIO
Well buy her some water

ORLANDO
We have no money

Horacio pulls out a small TOOTHPASTE tube from his backpack
He screws off the lid and with a string pulls out a small
twist of PESOS and US DOLLARS Both Orlando and Sayra are
surprised

Horacio pleased with himself hands Orlando the pesos

HORACIO (CONTD)
Two big bottles

Horacio looks at Sayra’s feet He reaches to touch them-

SAYRA
-No-no-no

He reaches for her foot again

SAYRA (CONTD)
No

Horacio sits in an awkward silence next to his daughter
staring at her feet

HORACIO
Your second toe is longer than your
big one

Sayra looks at her feet self consciously

HORACIO (CONT’D)
That means you’re a fast runner

He pulls out a FOLDED XEROX MAP of Mexico

HORACIO (CONT’D)
Look This is how far we got today
See

He places his finger at their position on the SOUTHERN BORDER
OF MEXICO with GUATEMALA tracing along a RAIL LINE that
traverses Mexico to the NORTH-EASTERN border of MEXICO

HORACIO (CONTD)
if la migra (Border Patrol)
don’t get us we’ll be here in two
weeks-

SAYRA
Two weeks chucha

HORACIO
Maybe three

-his finger arrives at a town called REYNOSA south of
Brownsville Texas

HORACIO (CONT’D)
There we cross

SAYRA
New Jersey

HORACIO
It’s not on the map

He looks at her she seems pale
HORACIO (CONT’D)
Are you nervous About the trains

Bandits

Sayra seems lost in thought Horacio motions to the HUNDREDS
of Immigrants around them

HORACIO
Not half these people are going to
make it
(he let’s this sink in on
her)

But we will

He puts the map in his wallet A picture of a woman peeks
out Sayra pulls the picture out a WOMAN holds TWO little
GIRLS 4 and 5 with Horacio smiling behind them The photo
only reminds her of who her father has been spending his last
ten years with She doesn’t like it

HORACIO (CONTD)
Yessenia’s not as pretty as your

of SAINTS

it over and caresses a ladies handwritten note “vuelve

He notices Sayra still looking at the photo

SAYRA

She gently pushes the photo back towards him He puts it
back in his wallet

HORACIO (CONT’D)

the patio and grabs Kimberly

from the darkness Smiley sits back down and starts throwing
pebbles again

EXT TAPACHULA TRAIN YARD - CONTINUOUS

Horacio reaches to wake Sayra but she is already up her
eyes red from an unrestful sleep

El Sol and his Maras walk past them Horacio keeps a wary
eye on them

Orlando notices them too He takes out a photograph of CECI
and kisses it before placing it in the bible while keeping
his eyes on them

Again the WHISTLE echoes out of the darkness Chaos ensues as
300 IMMIGRANTS hustle to find their groups

Another WHISTLE blasts even louder

Sayra watches the far end of the tracks The FREIGHT TRAIN
emerges from the darkness bathed in the blue-green glow
It’s a gigantic two-engine 30 car beast already covered
with 100 HUNDRED IMMIGRANTS

It glides into the train yard with a STOMACH SHAKING RUMBLE
dividing the yard in half as it comes to a halt

Horacio grabs Sayra’s and Orlando’s hands

HORACIO
Don’t let go

Fighting against the movement of the crowd towards the grain
cars Horacio plunges into the fray

A high-pitched POP and WHOOSH blasts from the breaks Dozens
of immigrants flinch jumping away from the wheels of the
train in a wave

Horacio climbs the ladder to the roof of a car and disappears
leaving Sayra and Orlando below They are pushed around by
others waiting of Horacio to reappear

His head peeks over the edge and waves urgently for Sayra and
Orlando to join him

EXT TOP OF BOXCAR

Sayra and Orlando heave themselves up over the edge and walk
towards the center of the car

They are at least two stories high in the air flanked by a
DOZEN IMMIGRANTS on the top of one car Sayra clasps
Orlando’s hands without realizing it

Around them immigrants run back and forth yelling across
cars The engine clanks into reverse pushing cars into each
other then settles A silence settles over the yard as the
hundreds of immigrant wait

Down at the back of the train in the darkness at the end of
the station an IMMIGRANT yells to Lucresia to bring some of
her food over

LUCRESIA
(yelling back)
Hell no You come here If I go
down there they’1ll break my ass

DONALD forties with frazzled hair and a round face pokes
his head over the top of the box car

Horacio turns towards him

HORACIO
Where did you hear that

DONALD
Others No train North tonight

They look at each other commiserating Horacio slaps his
hat in frustration Down the line of the train the passing
of the word “no train” is met with moans of disappointment
Lucresia calls out that her “shop” is still “open”

camera He is visibly intrigued by the pseudo-naked pictures
of Martha Marlene

Abue opens the door She looks like a living corpse thin
and fragile

ABUE
Benito go and get tortillas

Casper sits up groggily wiping his face She notices Casper
sleeping on the floor mutters to herself then disappears

Casper notices the camera in Smiley’s hands Enraged he
snatches it out and stuffs it in his pants

EL CASPER

mine

Horacio laughs He readjusts his baseball cap like a
pitcher then takes the stones and fires off three stones at
PLASTIC BOTTLES some thirty feet away Each one falls down
The Immigrants gasp impressed

SAYRA

Horacio quickly fires of three more stones at the reset
plastic bottles

The Immigrants are doubly amused Horacio holds out his hand
to collect the lempiras Donald pays up

answers

Out of the corner of his eye El Casper catches sight of
something and double-takes It’s Martha Marlen lurking
behind a tomb He doesn’t know how long she was there but

she didn’t just show up

She walks towards him with a hint of self-consciousness He

jumps to meet her

Martha Marlen smiles and kisses him noticing the
every one else for that matter staring at her

His attention snaps back to El Sol

EL CASPER

El Casper stares at El Sol there is a moment of cold
understanding between them Realizing his error he whips
around back towards Martha Marlen -- but she has
disappeared

WHAM It’s as if the GROUND comes up to meet his face El

EXT CEIBA TREE - DUSK 33

El Lil Mago walks Martha Marlen down the hill past a
gigantic trunk of a Ceiba tree some twenty feet in diameter

On the other side out of view from the others El Lil Mago
stops He sits down on one of the giant roots

EL LIL MAGO
This is the tallest tree in the
forest If you climbed to the top
of this one you could almost see

She moves in a couple of inches

EL LIL MAGO (CONTD)
So you and El Casper aren’t just
friends Are you

El Lil Mago puts his hand on Martha Marlen’s leg She looks
as if her stomach is turning into knots

MARTHA MARLEN
I have to go

El Lil Mago rubs her leg slowly moving higher

EL LIL MAGO
How much time you guys spend
together

Martha Marlen is frozen
EL LIL MAGO (CONTD)
You know what the most important

rules are in maintaining
friendships

El Lil Mago moves in closer right near her face

EL LIL MAGO (CONT’D)
Honesty

He grabs her breasts A wave of fear washes over Martha
Marlen He breathes in her smell around her neck

EL LIL MAGO (CONTD)
-and generosity

She pulls away as he kisses her neck but he holds onto her
She tries to break free but he reaches around her and pulls
her in She pushes him he pushes back

She jumps back against the tree but El Lil Mago grabs her
in a chokehold ripping her NECKLACE off

He holds her in a chokehold and brings her to the ground
unzipping his pants

She struggles with all her might but El Lil Mago overpowers
her and holds her tightly He turns her over pulls at her
pants gets them down She struggles to find a grip his arm
wraps around her face She bites him so hard he bleeds
letting her go

She tries crawling away dazed trying to find an escape El
Lil Mago kicks her from behind Her face slams into the
ground hard piercing her temple on a broken gravestone

El Lil Mago stands over her realizing he may have gone too
far

EL LIL MAGO
Hey Hey You okay

He rolls her over she’s gone He’s upset like a dog who
knows he’s done wrong He sits down next to her catching
his breath rationalizing He notices her necklace on the
ground and picks it up

El Casper holding his belly slowly makes his way down a row
of grave stones Lil’ Mago appears out of the darkness and
walks past him

mood is somber his tone cold and hard

EL CASPER
Where is she

EL LIL MAGO
She’s gone

These words register on El Casper’s face His emotions
strangle his heart in a vice as he tries to contain himself

EL LIL MAGO (CONTD)

El Lil Mago stretches El Casper can’t contain himself
anymore his eyes squeeze tears El Lil’ Mago notes it but
it’s unclear if he feels remorse El Casper starts to head
into the darkness searching

EL LIL’ MAGO
Wait

Lil’ Mago motions him over to Smiley who cries on the ground
ten feet away from him throbbing with fresh wounds El Lil
Mago kneels down next to him

EXT TAPACHULA TRAIN YARD - NIGHT 35

The train yard is filled with 300 IMMIGRANTS waiting for the
train to move again

Sayra and Horacio eat canned refried beans and tostadas They
look exhausted as they stuff their faces

Horacio watches as Sayra separates the beans from the rice
from the meat then eats one section at a time She picks out
the seeds from a pepper and scrapes them off her plate

HORACIO
Your Mom didn’t like chile either

Sayra turns her bracelet on her wrist

HORACIO (CONTD)

Sayra shakes her head

HORACIO
She used to wear one like that

Suddenly movement erupts down the line Orlando runs up to
them

been cleared The train’s leaving

EXT TAPACHULA TRAIN YARD - NIGHT 36

From high above the massive freight train is covered with
human bodies It pulls forward slowly each car yanking on
the next in one long clanking succession

Sarya Horacio and Orlando clamor for a position on top of a
box car The train cars hammer into each other again as the
train picks up speed

Sayra’s eyes are wide with uncertainty as she watches the

blue light from the radio tower pass over them and towards
the back of the train Horacio pulls her and Orlando into
him holding them like two kids

Suddenly they are enveloped in darkness Anxiety tickles her
spine the hair rises on her neck

EXT SIDE OF TRAIN - CONTINUOUS 37
El Lil Mago El Casper and Smiley get ready to jump aboard

El Casper is bent over nauseous He watches El Lil Mago in

the dark a bitter hate in his eyes

As they jump aboard immigrants distance themselves as best

they can They know quite well who they are and what they

can do

Smiley looks around excited He’s never been on a train

before He looks at Casper but he is locked in an

adrenaline drained trance

The train crosses the humid landscape passing in front of an
abandoned village and a church half buried with dirt and
covered in a tall grass

BETWEEN TRAIN CARS 40

El Lil Mago El Casper and Smiley refuse tortillas offered
by the immigrants next to them Lil’ Mago pulls out their
own food and disperses it to Casper and Smiley

El Casper holds the food but he doesn’t eat it Ina
trance he stares at the passing ground just underneath them
His eyes are red

Smiley points to Casper’s food He hands it to him without
looking Smiley stuffs it in his mouth

NORTH CHIAPAS COUNTRY-SIDE 41
The sun begins to set as the train curves around a mountain

Just west a great lagoon reflects the orange light of the

sun Above it storm clouds brew casting a dark shadow

across the mountain and Eastern sky

TOP OF BOXCAR 42

Sayra Horacio and Orlando look tired sun burned and
thirsty

The sky opens up and pours down rain Horacio taps Orlando

HORACIO
Pull out the plastic

Sayra pulls it out of Orlando’s backpack first while several
of the other immigrants pull out garbage bags with holes cut
out for their heads and arms

Horacio and Sayra spread out what looks like a plastic tarp
It covers at least FIVE people Others pull out similar
sheets and connect theirs with Horacio’s using their hands
to hold the seams together

UNDER THE PLASTIC 43
TEN hot and wet immigrants including Sayra Horacio and

Orlando huddle together with their plastic sheets covering
them

Orlando and Sayra laugh as they try to form a water tight
seam with the two sheets

44h

IN BETWEEN TRAIN CARS 44

Soaking wet El Casper notices a sign demarcating in TONALA 5
KM

Suddenly the heavy iron train cars slam into each other
like thunder rolling down the line of cars noticeably
slowing the train down

The train shutters to a stop creaking and wheezing breaks
popping They are stopped somewhere in the dense greenery

Nothing but the rain drops and creaking train can be heard

El Lil’ Mago taps El Casper and Smiley They pull out their
weaponry Smiley has his new chimba El Lil Mago a 45

Pistol and El Casper a machete

El Lil Mago nods a theatrical “goodbye” to the immigrants

next to them then climbs up to the TOP OF THE BOXCAR EL

CASPER distracted climbs up last

El Lil Mago points at a mound of immigrants hidden under a 44a
sheet of plastic Lil Mago points at them He signs them

to “lift up” the plastic on his signal

UNDER THE PLASTIC 45
Sayra and Orlando laugh as they drink up the leaking water
Horacio’s face is sprayed with water as they re-roll the

pieces together

TOP OF BOXCAR 46
El Lil Mago gives them the signal They rip it off

EL LIL MAGO
Your fucking money now

FIVE unsuspecting immigrants scream as they digest the shock
of being surrounded by armed Mareros

They hurriedly empty their pockets

UNDER THE PLASTIC 47

Sayra Orlando and Horacio sit calmly it’s not them Sayra
takes a big gulp of water and spits it on Horacio

TOP OF BOXCAR 48

An immigrant MAN empties his pockets His eyes are filled
with an indigestible panic as he avoids El Casper’s dark

stare The water comes down so hard that the drops make it
seem as if he’s crying

Smiley and El Lil Mago hand money to El Casper but he’s not
paying attention Smiley taps El Casper He wakes up and
places the money into a SMALL BOX

Smiley shakes with excitement intoxicated with the new
power He pushes the barrel of his chimba into the same
man’s temple studying his reaction with pleasure

El Casper looks at Smiley the boy is learning quickly

El Lil Mago turns and leads them to the end of the car
scanning the immigrants who stare at him with terror He
makes a running jump to THE NEXT BOXCAR

There ANOTHER GROUP OF IMMIGRANTS huddle under plastic
El Casper jumps across next his feet slip on the wet roof
but El Lil Mago catches him He smiles at El Casper

throwing his arm over his back

Smiley hesitates He’s afraid to jump Annoyed Lil’ Mago
continues on Casper watches him with contained contempt

UNDER THE PLASTIC 49

Suddenly light and water pour down on Sayra Orlando and
Horacio like a hurricane has ripped off the roof of their
temporary house

SHRIEKS of fear scatter in the wind and rain

Sayra closes her mouth tightly as the water pounds her face
Horacio grabs her

EL LIL MAGO

El Lil Mago kneels down in front of Sayra He notices her

HORACIO
(to Orlando and Sayra)
Empty your pockets Empty them

El Lil Mago jams his pistol into her jaw and forces her head
towards Casper Dread fills Horacio’s face he pleads with El
Lil Mago

HORACIO

Horacio automatically grabs El Lil Mago’s shoulder He
smacks Horacio in the head with the pistol knocking him into
a daze

EL LIL MAGO
Everyone turn around

Everyone including Sayra Horacio and Orlando turn around

EL LIL MAGO (CONTD)
(to Sayra)
No not you baby

Sayra trembles as she turns back around she looks over her
shoulder at Orlando and Horacio but they are turned with
Smiley’s chimba pressed against their heads

Sayra looks at El Casper her eyes plead with him he looks
away She begins to break down the fear coursing through
her body she screams for help

SAYRA
No please No Papi

EL LIL MAGO
Take her down with us

Horacio holds his bleeding head Orlando prays aloud
crying

We move towards El Casper as time and sound imperceptibly
slows

He stares at Sayra who’s eyes plea to him for help

Then at Smiley who is just now climbing onto their train
car Smiley takes in the scene the scared immigrant’s
faces Horacio’s bleeding head Sayra under Lil’ Mago and El
Casper’s departed stare

El Lil Mago gropes Sayra’s body She resists he smacks the
back of her head

The train cars creak then the distant slamming of cars grows
loud again This time as the train pulls forward down the
line the rolling boom awakens El Casper from his stupor He
drops the BOX of money it tumbles off the train

El Lil Mago sees this he turns towards El Casper curiously
just in time to see

El Casper’s machete bearing down on him slicing two inches
into his neck and severing his jugular El Lil Mago stares
at El Casper in confusion his face quickly losing color El
Casper hacks twice more

Blood sprays over Sayra as El Lil Mago grips his gushing
neck and collapses onto her She kicks him off her
violently

Smiley still holding the chimba to Horacio’s head notices
El Lil Mago’s slumped body His eyes dart up to El Casper
dumbfounded

El Casper snatches the chimba out of Smiley’s hands and grabs
him as if he were going to throw him

He looks into Smiley’s scared eyes but cannot hurt him He
let’s go of him and backs up His hands shake as he
determines the next course of action

EL CASPER
Get off the train Smiley

SMILEY
Casper

Orlando and the others look at El Casper and Smiley The
train is moving swiftly again

EL CASPER
Go

He looks at El Lil Mago’s dead body its legs twitch El
Casper nudges it It falls under the wheels of the train and
disappears Smiley is still frozen

EL CASPER (CONTD)
(beginning to cry angrily)
He killed Martha Marlen

Smiley looks at him in confusion again
EL CASPER (CONTD)

Go home Benito Go back to your
Grandma

50A

Smiley retreats down the ladder

EXT BETWEEN CARS

Smiley makes a cross on his chest and jumps off the train
His feet pedal fast but his momentum topples him

rolling him several times down the train’s road bed to a foot
path The train passes by rapidly

EXT TOP OF BOXCAR

Sayra moans an exhausted cry El Lil Mago’s blood washes
down her face in drops of rain Orlando and Horacio reach

out to her

HORACIO
Are you okay Did he hurt you

Horacio tries to hold her but she pushes him away

From this moment on EL Casper is no longer El Casper he has
become the civilian WILLY and will be described as such

Nauseated WILLY stumbles to the other end of the boxcar and
vomits placing the chimba and the bloody machete next to
him

EXT ROAD BED - LATER

The rain has stopped Smiley stands above El Lil Mago’s
body lying in a puddle of blood and water His eyes are open
and his skin is bluegray his left leg is gone ripped off
at the hip and his other leg is twisted 180 degrees in the
other direction Flies and mosquitos buzz around his head
Smiley digs around his clothes pulls out his cell phone He
checks it it works

EXT TOP OF BOXCAR - NIGHT

The rain has stopped and the sky is clear Sayra is quiet
She trembles from the cold and wet clothes

On the other end of the car Willy sits by himself

Horacio Orlando and several other immigrants whisper
inaudibly to each other all we hear is

50A

IMMIGRANT 1
We are riding with the Devil
He’1l curse us all

They keep their eyes on Willy unaware that he knows they are
watching him THREE IMMIGRANTS present themselves in front
of Horacio offering CIGARETTES and a COUPLE LOLLI-POPs for
Sayra Horacio accepts the gifts

OTHER SIDE OF BOX CAR - NIGHT

Tears begin to drip down Willy’s face He breaks down but
makes no noise as if he were crying on mute

TOP OF BOXCAR - NIGHT

Horacio’s eyes are red but they are wide and wary He looks
down at Sayra She holds herself to stay warm

Orlando covers her with the plastic bag and leans in to
whisper to her

ORLANDO
Are you okay

Sayra turns away With her back to Horacio and Orlando she
watches Willy cry

Horacio turns on a FLASHLIGHT and scans the ground next to
the tracks All along the train OTHER IMMIGRANTS do the
same DOZENS of flashlights scanning for bandits Migra and
Mareros like WWII air-raid search lights only here they are
pointed at the ground

EXT TOP OF BOXCAR - DAY

Dawn The car is divided into two sides Willy on the front
side and the rest of the FORTY immigrants jammed on the other
half

Everyone is awake including Horacio and Orlando (lollipops
in mouth) watching Willy He sits on the edge of the car

with his legs dangling over the edge his eyes half-closed
He struggles to stay awake wary of the immigrants watching
him but sleep overtakes him

THREE IMMIGRANTS from the night before motion to each other
Two have their farming tools machetes wrapped in plastic
protective sheathes The other scavenges a large rock
formerly used to hold down his tarp

They creep towards Willy quietly ready to attack

Sayra gasps awake between Horacio and Orlando both of whom
intently watch what is about to go down

Slowly Sayra realizes what they are doing They close in
on Willy she points out to the horizon at first unable to
speak she repeats herself until she finds her voice
suddenly screaming

SAYRA
Migra

Everyone including Willy and the THREE attackers look at
her then where she’s pointing

Willy looks at Sayra -- then the attackers He understands
their intent and grabs his chimba

The element of surprise is lost they retreat back to their
side of the train car

Meanwhile the entire train comes alive as others pass the
word screaming

IMMIGRANTS
(telephoning down the
train)

Migra

Hundreds scramble to their feet ducking and scanning the
horizon Some point out to the side searching for a glimpse
of the raid Others ready to jump

Horacio and Orlando look where Sayra is pointing but they
cannot see anything There is no Migra raid

The THREE immigrants who were going to attack Willy sit near
Horacio and Sayra they stare at her suspiciously

Horacio and Orlando look at her she looks straight back at
them unflinching

OTHER SIDE OF TRAIN CAR - LATER

Willy stands up On the car in front of him a group of
immigrants stare at him Willy looks at them and they
immediately look away He turns and looks behind him The
same effect happens with the group on his car Only Sayra
holds his stare

He looks down at the rails passing beneath him flirting with
the sensation of falling He closes his eyes feels the air

rushing around him His balance waivers he opens them again
and turns to see if Sayra is still staring at him She is

Orlando and Horacio check in with each other wondering what
he is doing

Willy kneels down and picks up his chimba he looks around
him at the immigrants who pretend like they’re not looking
at him then tosses it off the side of the train

EXT SIDE OF BOXCAR - DAY

The train is stopped Horacio Sayra and Orlando eat more
tortillas and beans from a can

Without anything else to drink immigrants collect brackish
water from an irrigation ditch along the tracks with empty
soda bottles

Donald offers Sayra a sip She declines

DONALD
It’s clean

ORLANDO
It looks like Kool-aid

Donald sticks the bottle of water to his eye and stares into
it like a kaleidoscope

DONALD
(smiling)
Clean

He grabs his shirt wraps it around the opening and drinks
through it like a filter He pulls out a small box from his
pocket and shakes it like a rattler

DONALD (CONTD)
If we get sick I have pills

He rubs his stomach soothingly

Sayra takes the water wraps her shirt around the top and
takes a few sips

She looks at Willy still in the same place She grabs a
scrap of newspaper wraps a couple tortillas in it with beans
and starts to climb up the train Horacio grabs her arm

HORACIO
Sayra

She yanks free and keeps climbing Horacio spits

HORACIO (CONT’D)
We’re cleaned out and she gives
him our last

ORLANDO
Be patient with her

Horacio is visibly frustrated

ORLANDO
Can’t Yessenia send money

Horacio shakes his head

HORACIO
No we’ll have to make it to the
border on our own then she can
wire the money for the crossing

EXT TOP OF STOPPED TRAIN 59

Willy sits by himself His cell phone beeps again It’s EL
Sol GREENLIGHT You’re dead The BATTERY warning signals
as well Willy stuffs the phone away digesting the news

With Willy only a few feet away Sayra whistles through her
teeth Willy doesn’t move She inches closer Willy spins
around his hand lingering over his MACHETE He recognizes
her

Sayra holds her free hand up places a tostada with beans and
her lollipop between them He relaxes but only slightly

WILLY
Thank you

He stretches his other arm out and grabs the food

Donald climbs up to the top of the car Noticing Sayra and
Willy together he situates himself closer to Willy’s side of
the train while maintaining a liberal distance

TWO others follow his lead extending themselves over more
space of the boxcar Then more of the group suddenly spread
out fed up with the divide of the car Horacio and Orlando
included

SAYRA
My name is Sayra

He hesitates at first about to say “Casper”

WILLY
Willy

Saying it instead of “Casper” fills Willy with remorse
That part of him is dead now Sayra retreats back to her
side of the train car Alone Willy eats furiously while
keeping a watchful eye on the immigrants around him

INT EL LIL MAGO’S HOUSE - DAY

The Maras are packed into the living room most cry El Sol
speaks into a cell phone

EL SOL
(to El Bomba)
--I’m almost out of credit Call
DF with yours
(back into the receiver)
Yes on the train

EL BOMBA
(to Smiley)
I don’t understand how you let him
go

El Sol hands his phone away

EL SOL
Because Smiley is a little bitch
Well find Casper We’1l find him
and cut him up into small pieces

SMILEY
(under his breath)
I’m no bitch I came back

EL SOL (CONT’D)
Levanten la garra Mara
Salvatrucha

They raise their hands in front of their faces making the
“devils horns” with their index fingers for 13 SECONDS then
drop them

EL SOL
We need to elect the a new
Ranflero Who does the Barrio
choose

With out hesitation the members call out Sol’s name He
looks around gravely it is not what he wanted

EL SOL (CONTD)
Alright Alright I accept
Now El Casper

El Sol scratches his chin in pained thought

EL BOMBA
We should all go get him now

EL SOL
We can’t Not with all the pinche
chavalas on top of us We’1l loose
everything No We spread the
word Even if we don’t find him
immediately he has no where to go
Hell pop up eventually And when
he does-

SMILEY
-I’m no bitch

EL SOL
You’re lucky I haven’t shot you
already Smiley you’re not a true
Marero For all we know you helped
El Casper escape Is that what
happened Huh Huh

SMILEY
(fear coursing threw him)
No no I didn’t

EL SOL
I’m going to banish you from the
colonia

Smiley sinks into a barely perceptible despair but somewhere
inside him a response to the fear is formed anger He
tries to find the voice for it

SMILEY
Don’t banish me Please

El Sol opens himself up for Smiley to hit him Smiley
doesn’t budge

EL SOL
Prove it Prove to me you’re not a
little bitch

El Sol fakes a movement -- Smiley flinches -- he shakes his
head in disappointment

SMILEY
Send me Send me to find to
kill El Casper
El Sol looks at Smiley a tear drips down his face
El Sol pulls out a rusted 38 Special and points it in
Smiley’s face Smiley flinches Sol flips the gun around

and gives it to Smiley

EL SOL (CONTD)

Go then

(BEAT)
But Smiley until El Casper is
dead you can’t step one foot in La
Confeti

Smiley avoids the stare of the men then turns and heads out
of the house Annoyed and impatient Sol turns his attention
to the group

EL SOL (CONT’D)
Call the LA ranfleros Everyone
must know everyone’s got to be on
the look out for El Casper He
will have no where to hide

The hatred in El Sol’s face is palpable

EXT TOP OF BOXCAR - NIGHT

You can see all the immigrants even the ones far in the
front holding onto the side of the cars Horacio slaps his
face to stay awake Sayra sleeps in between them

Orlando begins to drift off into sleep but Horacio slaps
him Orlando looks at Horacio surprised

Sayra sits up She motions for Orlando to lay down They
switch places and he lies down between her and Horacio

Horacio grabs her hand His eyes are heavy with exhaustion

SAYRA
Sleep I’1ll hold on to both of you

He shakes his head no silently mouthing that he’s okay
Branches swoosh by whipping the faces of immigrants sitting
too high

OTHER SIDE OF BOXCAR —- CONTINUOUS

Willy struggles to stay awake He unbuckles his belt wraps
it through a ring on the wagon top and around his waist
again

Below him between the train cars a group of immigrants SING
to keep themselves awake their voices are rough but they
sing with conviction

His eyes close for a moment then he shakes awake again He
feels something in his pocket realizing he still has the
camera he pulls it out Turns it on The glow of the
screen illuminates his face He looks at the IMAGES of
Martha Marlene His eyes tears

EXT TOP OF BOXCAR - DAY

It’s quiet other than the sound of the creaking train cars
and the muffled hammering of iron wheels

The dawn light reveals the overwhelming fatigue on everyone’s
face some of whom haven’t slept in four days

The train cruises through the largest town they’ve seen yet
A sign reads ISLAS next to the train tracks The creaking
train rolls past stores and markets opening their doors to
the new day

Pedestrians on the streets watch the passing train half
amused half asleep while the Immigrants watch the passing
town hypnotized with fatigue

Willy LOLLIPOP in mouth starts to climb down the stairs
but notices Sayra is watching him She shakes her head as
if to say “don’t go”

He drops down between the cars anyway unzips his pants and
urinates The idea of jumping off and disappearing into the
town dissipates as soon as he begins seeing “M” “S graffiti
along the tracks just beyond the observing stares of the
CITIZENS of the town The train is the only home he has now

His phone beeps again He pulls it out It’s dead He
drops it beneath the train and climbs back up Sayra and he
make prolonged eye contact she smiles to herself

EXT TIERRA BLANCA - DAY 64
SUPER TIERRA BLANCA VERACRUZ
SUPER US Border 1100 NORTH

The train pulls into a similarly ragged and industrial
station as the one in Tapachula

Willy notices the large “Devil’s Hand” of the Mara
Salvatrucha spray painted on the side of a concrete building

Willy scans the horizon looking for other signs of his
former “brothers” Every LONE FIGURE looks like a danger to
him

Along the tracks he spots a MAN scanning the immigrants on
the trains Willy’s defenses immediately go on alert They
make eye-contact the man walks towards the train then
disappears behind a wagon

The train slows to a crawl as the 300 Immigrants pile off the
train Some including Orlando kneel to the ground and
pray

Willy stays atop the train glancing between Sayra and a
GROUP OF MEN he thinks could be Mareros melting into the
crowd Just as he’s about to lose sight of Sayra she motions
for him to follow her He jumps down tucking his machete
under his arm

EXT COLONIA CONFETI BRIDGE - DAY 65

Smiley throws rocks into the trash filled river below The
same THREE KIDS from the colonia sit and listen to him

BENNY
You’re going to hurt him

Smiley nods The kids mimic his side armed throwing style
KID 2
You’re not going to kill him
though are you

Smiley nods

BENNY
But it’s Casper

Smiley throws another rock hard then another with each
throw he tries to convince himself he’s man enough

SMILEY
It’s the responsibility of a true
Marero to avenge the death of
another Be it Casper or whoever
(BEAT)
So I’m gonna do it I gotta do
it

BENNY
How You gotta gun

Smiley pulls out the rusted 38 -- the kids are both awed and
afraid Smiley smiles at its (and transversely his own)
power tucking the pistol away again into his pants

SMILEY
La Mara

Down the tracks in La Bombilla the train’s WHISTLE BLOWS
Smiley nods goodbye to the kids then heads off down the
tracks

EXT IMMIGRANT REST STOP PATIO - DAY

Willy follows Sayra and her family and about 20 immigrants
towards a rest house -- a small concrete home with a patio
situated off the tracks Inside Immigrants gather to
shower change clothes and rest in the shade

He eyes everyone carefully evaluating -- anyone could be a
look out for the Maras or any other gang that could want to
kill him

Horacio grabs Sayra motioning towards Willy

HORACIO
He’s following us

Sayra knows why Orlando watches unsure what to say

SAYRA
We could help him

HORACIO
Absolutely not You’re to keep
away from him

SAYRA HORACIO
Are you ordering me He’s a murderer- Yes yes I’m
ordering you

SAYRA
He’s in trouble
HORACIO
I don’t care about him I care

about us

Sayra is disgusted with Horacio she looks to Orlando for
support but he says nothing Horacio acutely annoyed pulls
out the XEROX MAP from his pocket

HORACIO (CONT’D)
Look

He points to TIERRA BLANCA still only 13 of the way to the
US BORDER Sayra is subtly surprised

HORACIO
We’re here We’ve got a long way
to go Sayra We have to stay
sharp stick together We can’t
let anyone ruin this for us okay

EXT IMMIGRANT REST STOP PATIO - DAY 67

The sun has set but the sky is still light Thirty
immigrants linger on the patio Some eat some sleep some
re-apply make-up some talk on a pay phone with home

Horacio is in line for the phone while Orlando talks with
SEVERAL other immigrants about their economic predicaments
back home (45 lempiras a day speech)

Sayra fresh from a shower sits in front of a GIRL who
braids her hair the girl compliments Sayra’s skin She
tries to make herself look pretty again

In a darkened corner of the patio Willy sits by himself
watching the others No one approaches him

EXT IN FRONT OF IMMIGRANT REST STOP - LATER 67A

Tired and bored immigrants lie about Sayra squats next to
Willy

SAYRA
You going to wash up

Willy shakes his head

SAYRA
It feels nice
WILLY
Later maybe When there are less
people
SAYRA
Then what’1l you do
WILLY
Dunno
SAYRA
You going to stay here for the
night
Willy shrugs
SAYRA
If I find any food Ill bring you

some

Willy is unsure how to take her kindness Sayra smiles then
leaves him to his thoughts LOCALS sit in their patios
eating food The immigrants stare at them enviously
smacking their dry mouths

Atop one of the abandoned train cars THREE IMMIGRANTS light
cigarettes then one of them bellows out in a joking tone

IMMIGRANT HOST
Thank you and welcome to the show
I know some of you have come from
as far away as San Pedro Sula to
see this you wont be
disappointed First up on our line
up Eugenio will sing a love ballad
to his third and ugliest wife

For a moment the immigrants laugh able to forget the hunger
pangs and boredom Both Willy and Sayra smile He looks
around at the other smiling faces one of them a glue
sniffer with no teeth smiles while looking at him hard he
makes the sign of a Barrio 18 but Willy doesn’t really
flinch he knows he’s just a glue sniffer

68 EXT IMMIGRANT REST STOP PATIO - LATER

Willy walks past Horacio on the way to the showers Horacio
grabs his arm

HORACIO

Horacio’s grasp)
Willy

HORACIO
Willy my name is Horacio That
girl over there she’s my daughter
Sayra and he over there is my
little brother Orlando They’re

something If it’s money you want
I’1l give you some as soon as my
wire comes in other than that I
don’t know you I don’t trust you
and I don’t want you coming
anywhere near my family Do you
understand me

Willy nods he knows Horacio’s type Stubborn and
impenetrable He walks away

69 EXT IMMIGRANT REST STOP PATIO - DAY

Willy and Sayra help prepare a meal for the Senora of the
house a kind faced middle aged woman He notices the
contrails of a passenger-jet over head He stares at it long
enough that she notices and squints to see what he’s looking
at

WILLY
Ever been on one

She shakes her head

WILLY (CONTD)
Me neither
(BEAT)
In Texas I saw the factory where
they make them-
SAYRA
-You’ve been to Texas

WILLY

I’ve been to little of everywhere
This factory had this huge globe

like a giant ball all lit up and
bright I wanted to climb it

SAYRA

SAYRA

I will I know I will Back home

freaky voice that I’d make it to

WILLY

My girl saw a woman like that once

SAYRA

(playing it nonchalant)

You have a girl

Martha Marlen’s death hits Willy again Willy focuses on his

work again

WILLY

The conversation falls into silence

Sayra looks at Willy

who seems like his mind is elsewhere

SAYRA

Willy doesn’t even look at her
WILLY

SAYRA
Doesn’t matter he’s my father only

swept her away Almost swept us

Willy listens quietly

SAYRA
It was a long time ago I don’t
really remember her I remember
him even less I was a baby when
he left for the North

She motions to Horacio

WILLY
New Jersey huh

SAYRA

heavy

SAYRA

EXT VERACRUZ COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Willy Sayra and family sit atop another train car The
train accelerates through the farmlands towards a foggy
mountain range looming across the Northern skyline

Everyone sits quietly lost in their thoughts Their heads
rock back and forth with the movement of the train

On the horizon above the train along a ridge of low lying
mountains a gigantic STATUE OF JESUS stands like Lady
Liberty it’s arms spread out to welcome them

Orlando looks at the Jesus and crosses himself whispering an
inaudible prayer over the photograph of Ceci Sayra prays as
well while Horacio stretches

Willy stares at the Jesus statue searching for feeling
again for hope He crosses himself and mentally pleads to
Jesus

Sayra turns and sees him praying

SAYRA
What are you asking him for

WILLY
Too much

SAYRA
I prayed for us both

Willy is touched by Sayra’s thoughtfulness and sincerity

EXT VERACRUZ HIGHLAND
The air is cool and gray A mist envelops the train tracks

Out of the gray milkiness shadowy figures emerge running
along the tracks They startle Willy He readies himself
for a possible Mara attack His machete at arms length is
still his only accessory

Suddenly a sack of tortillas lands on his lap He looks at it
oddly

Sayra stands and looks out

There are TWO DOZEN KIDS and ADULTS peasants in simple
clothes throwing food to the IMMIGRANTS on the train

TWO nine years-old GIRLS run along Sayra and Willys car
Their smiles beam as they throw another bag that Sayra grasps
awkwardly Inside are oranges

SAYRA
Thank you

GIRLS
(in unison)
You’re welcome

Sayra and Willy smile at each other Life is getting better
The train awakens as IMMIGRANTS scramble to catch the gifts
while yelling “thank you” and “God bless you” to the
peasants

EXT ORIZABA INDUSTRIAL YARDS

The train cars SLAM into each other as the train slows to
enter the Orizaba train yards

The Maras’ Carrola comes to a skidding stop Smiley jumps out
with the others and runs down the side of the train The high-
pitched POP of the hydraulic breaks scares him -- he jumps
back

The train pulls itself into the gated yard
He scans the train cars all empty

EL SCARFACE

along the edge of the fenced train yard

Sayra Willy Horacio Orlando and Donald emerge from the
canal on to the other side of the train yard an open expanse
that faces the high mountains of Orizaba pass

From what they can see there are TWENTY Immigrants casually
waiting for the train to come through and no sign of police
or migra

They sit and catch their breath Just then ruckus erupts
down towards the gate where the trains exit

THREE Maras El Pajaro El Sipe and El Chino rush out of El
Scarface’s Carrola They scan the immigrants trudging
through huddled groups throwing backpacks around and pushing
people It is abundantly clear they are looking for Willy
and making a huge fearless stir

Willy stands calculates has no options but to escape He
picks up his machete walks back slowly then crouches down a
ditch away from the station making his way down the tracks

The Maras pass Sayra Horacio and Orlando The family tries
not to look in the direction where Willy went

El Sipe pauses looking at Sayra suspiciously He continues
on

EXT ABANDONED TRAIN CARS AND CANAL - CONTINUOUS

Willy hides behind a boxcar breathing hard his heart
thumping El Chino is the first one to enter his alley of
abandoned cars He turns the corner where Willy is standing
but he’s gone El Chino keeps moving

Above on top of the car Willy lays on his belly He looks
around El Pajaro approaches from the other side Noticing
El Sipe ahead of him he climbs into the box car and looks
around Willy can see him through holes in the roof El Sipe
crosses the car onto the next tracks

Willy crawls down into the boxcar through a hole He lands
nimbly then carefully peaks down the line of cars to see El
Sipe and El Pajaro’s progress

THUMP He looks up Some one is one the roof He steps
back against the wall of the car light rays streaming down
around him then a shadow He sees a GUN in the man’s hands
It’s El Pajaro

Willy stops breathing they are right next to each other
The wind blows trash inside the car El Pajaro stops looks
down He doesn’t seem to see Willy He keeps moving

Willy exhales He waits for a moment then slowly exits the
car tracking back towards the station

He passes another open boxcar on the other side El Sipe
stares at Willy Recognition clicks

WHOOMP A rock slams into the side of his head El Sipe
collapses

Willy is confused Then Horacio appears a car length down
holding another rock in his hands

Willy’s face reveals shock then relief

trapped behind a car Shards of glass spray over them as

bullets THUMP into the rocking car

The Barrio 18 soldiers have fanned out down the street

making their way towards them firing POT SHOTS advancing in

the open then retreating as Scarface fires back
Smiley is frozen with fear

EL SCARFACE
Pull out your fucking gun Smiley

Smiley fumbles for the pistol in his pocket

EL SCARFACE
How many bullets do you have

SMILEY

are all tucked into the protected under-section of a GRAIN
CONTAINER CAR but it is freezing anyway

Horacio unwraps a BUNDLE of dirty blankets and decomposing
sweaters They try their best to cover themselves

Willy and Orlando hang from the side of the train car
holding their arms out waiting for long blades of grass and
dry branches they can break free

Willy snatches up a long stalked weed and tosses it to Sayra

EXT BETWEEN TWO TRAIN CARS - LATER 84
They’ve piled up a mound of burnable items
They move closer as Orlando sparks his lighter

Finally he’s got it and the small damp pile of material
begins to smoke

Orlando Willy and Sayra fan it blowing into it It catches
and they all moan with pleasure as the heat radiates from the
flames

Willy lights a cigarette off of a branch and inhales
gratefully then passes it along

EXT BETWEEN TWO TRAIN CARS - DUSK 85

The fire is only a pile of burning embers Horacio quietly
stares at the photograph of his family Sayra notices
Strangely she finds that it hurts her Willy climbs out and
tries to gather more branches but the tracks are sparse

He quickly dips his head back in WHOOMPH darkness consumes
them they are in a tunnel in complete darkness

After a few seconds they see the sky again and for a
moment catch a glimpse at the magnificent view they have
from the side of the mountain thousands of feet below a
beautiful canyon extends into the horizon

The train passes into another tunnel and darkness consumes
them again

Others MOAN on the train some yell just because they think
it will make them feel warmer The sound crescendos

As the train hits light again Willy and Sayra realize that
they are pressed intimately close together Her hand
innocently placed on his for warmth

They look at each other slightly embarrassed but she
doesn’t let go of his hand Horacio doesn’t seem to notice
his attention and his mind somewhere off in New Jersey

They enter another tunnel and are consumed in darkness again

EXT HIGHLANDS ABOVE MEXICO CITY - DAWN

The sun has yet to peak over the highlands The entire group
lays awkwardly upon one another Frost covers their plastic
bags and the rails of the tanker

Willy and Sayra are still pressed together All sleep

To the right the Aztec pyramids of Teotihuacan rise from the
purple horizon and to the left the mass of Mexico City
lurks ominously in a brown smoggy haze

The train cruises slowly through an insignificant looking
town Willy rises No one notices him He is tired he has
slept awkwardly and he is dazed

He hangs off the side of the car he takes one last look at
sleeping Sayra then hops swiftly to the ground

EXT SIDE OF TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

Willy heads down a side street away from the train just as
the last car passes by The sudden silence is peaceful

He senses someone walking behind him He turns shocked

On the rolling hills north of Mexico City Horacio and

Orlandos red freight train speeds around reservoirs and

quaint villages

It moves faster than the other trains and they have to brace

themselves for the turns and bumps that are more shocking
than the previous trains were

There are few immigrants on this train Perhaps no more than
100 for a train bigger than the one they began on in Chiapas

The train passes through a neighborhood where the children
are walking to class in their school uniforms

As soon as they see the train the kids begin to yell

At first Orlando think it’s cute all of the kids running
along with them But then the kids start picking up rocks
and throwing them The large rocks bounce hard off the fast
moving train

He is shocked The CHILDREN laugh as they throw the rocks and
yell at the immigrants on the train

ADULTS watch from the doorsteps of dilapidated concrete
houses but they do nothing to stop the kids

One rock bounces off an immigrant’s head and lands next to

Horacio The immigrant grasps his head in pain The duck for
cover

at an IMAGE that he took of he and Martha Marlene together
His TEAR tattoo looks striking in the photo He turns off
the camera Sadness leads to anger

He adjusts the rearview mirror so that he can look at
himself He feels the tear drop tattoo next to his eye and

into the theatre’s main room It’s an immense space
probably able to fit thousands at one point

At the front of the balcony she sees that many have stayed
this place Hundreds of names are scribbled around

One marking “Oriana Carbajal-Hernandez septiembre 2001”

Sayra takes a piece of concrete and scratches in her own
name “Sayra Miranda Guzman” She stares at her second to
last name “Miranda”

She sits in one of the seats and opens up the backpack

DONALD
I have bad news Your Uncle has
been deported and your father is
with the angels

Sayra doesn’t believe it nor can Willy She’s in complete
denial until Donald grabs her hands At first she laughs
like she thinks it’s a joke Willy doesn’t know what to do
He tries to reach out to touch her but hesitates

Sayra unexpectedly even to herself cries She stands and
leaves the room leaving Willy and Donald sitting with each
other

Willy notices a CARLOAD OF MAREROS posted in front of it
Along the water Mareros casually hang out where immigrants
gather to cross over illegally

They keep walking up river

EXT RIO BRAVO SHORE - DAY

The Mexican side of the river is a maze of thick high weeds
that resemble a super sized briar patch Willy and Sayra
maneuver their way through the weeds until it opens up along
the creamy-green Rio Bravo

It’s an encampment of immigrants covered in the refuse of
the hundreds who have passed through it before

SEVERAL men rest under a tree There are NEEDLES on the
ground near them

WILLY
We’re looking for a pato

One of the men LECHE late-twenties skinny and pale like a
junkie looks up at them He wears a baseball cap and a black
shirt with a giant SNOW TIGER face

LECHE

EXT MECHANICS GARAGE - DAY 119

A Garage mainly used for tires is situated a stones throw
from the river

holds up his fingers like the “peace” sign

They look at the spinning signs of fast food restaurants on
the US side of the river

SAYRA

WILLY

SAYRA
It doesn’t matter to me

Willy smiles wistfully She leans on him

want you to make me a promise

She shyly hands him the camera He’s surprised He looks at
her only slightly angered but more happy to have the camera
back

EXT BRIAR WEEDS - DAY 121
Leche leads Willy and Sayra through the maze of weeds A
SILHOUETTE dashes across an opening in the distance No one
notices it but Willy He grabs onto Sayra and pushes her

along faster

EXT RIO BRAVO - DAY 122

Leche sits on an INNER-TUBE in a speedo

LECHE

that Willy is heavily disappointed about this He motions
for her to go

Willy nor Sayra have any money He reaches into his pocket
and gives Leche the camera Leche inspects it Accepts
Sayra is bitter-sweetly amazed

You first

Sayra looks at him nervously

WILLY (CONT’D)
Go on now

She hugs him tightly he kisses her on her forehead

WILLY (CONT’D)
(to Leche)
Hey you Turn around

Willy points at Leche who was watching Sayra optimistically
Willy gives Sayra her privacy too and turns around just as
he sees movement again in the tall weeds

WILLY (CONTD)
Hurry up and get in the water
girl

Sayra undresses to her underwear quickly puts her clothes in
a plastic bag and slips into the water Willy turns around
he tells Sayra slowly and deliberately

WILLY (CONTD)
Itll be okay

Leche grabs onto a rope tied to the BLACK INNER-TUBE and
pulls Sayra into the current of the river

Sayra watches Willy as she’s pulled further into the river
there is a sadness in his eyes She suddenly understands
why he’s not getting ready

A TATTOOED FACE appears in a clearing She barely has time
to warn him when he raises a chimba BAM A bullet whizzes
over Willy’s head Willy ducks then picks up a rock and
throws it at the Marero

Willy darts into the briar patch of tunnels
Sayra yells after him

SAYRA
Willy

But he’s gone
SAYRA (CONTD)
(to Leche)
We have to go back

LECHE
No

She struggles with Leche

SAYRA
Let go of me let go

LECHE
If you get off you’ll drown There
are whirlpools all along that bank

EXTINT RIO BRAVO SHORE MAZE 123

The rustling footsteps increase silhouettes and shadows zoom
by Willy COOING and CAWING sounds from all directions The
turns and roundabouts in the maze become blurs

Willy comes face to face with another MARERO his entire face
is covered in tattoos Willy ducks as he lunges for him

He dives behind a log His fingers scan the ground for a
weapon he finds a boulder and waits

As another set of footsteps approach he jumps out hammering
the bolder into a man’s stomach He looks down it’s El Sol
gasping for air

Willy dashes for the river but just when he gets to the
edge he sees Smiley blocking his way the rusted revolver
hanging heavily in his lowered hand

WILLY
Smiley

Smiley looks up at Willy fearfully his mouth goes dry

Willy implores him with his eyes to let him by

The silhouettes of the pursuing Maras including El Scarface
fast approach Smiley can see them feel the pressure of them
getting closer his eyes change to confused sad anger He

raises the pistol

WILLY
Smiley

SMILEY
La Mara carnal

BAM Smiley fires into Willy’s stomach It leaks blood
Willy stumbles to the waters edge

Crying he fires again WHAM The bullet hits his kidney
Then again and again and again
OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER 124

Sayra just reaches the shore as the second shot blasts out
She screams

SAYRA
Willy
(to Leche)
We have to go back for him

Leche backs into the weeds on the US side of the river
then turns and runs away

She grabs the inner-tube and jumps back into the water

She struggles to swim back towards Willy but the current has
already brought her far enough down river that it’s making it
impossible for her to get back to his position

EXT WILLY AND SMILEY’S SIDE OF THE RIVER 125
More Mareros gather watching Willy stumble into the water

Suddenly they open up on him BULLETS from their wide variety
of weaponry pummeling his body

The Mareros each take turns spitting on him Smiley is the

only one not to do it He looks at Willy’s body with a

mixture of hurt and nausea

SIRENS from both sides of the river approach their direction

As a group the men disappear into the shadows of the weeds

EXT DOWN RIVER 126
Sayra cannot compete with the force of the current she’s

floating away She stops trying

EXT US SIDE OF RIVER - CONTINUOUS 127
TWO US Border Patrol vehicles speed to the site drawn by

the gun fire

EXT RIVER 128
Mareros follow Willy’s body as it drifts down stream

silently observing its progress from the shadows

POV FROM UNDERWATER 129

Willy’s lifeless body leaks black blood into the green water

EXT US SIDE OF RIVER
The Border Patrol vehicles follow as well

Sayra ditches the inner-tube and struggles to an alcove of
weeds on the US side of the river

She collapses with fatigue and cries She breathes hard as
the weight of all that has happened sinks in Her labored
breathing slowly becomes a heavy moaning cry She has lost
everyone

FADE OUT

MONTAGE FADE IN

INT EL LIL MAGO’S HOUSE TAPACHULA - DAY

MUSIC fades in The LOCATION SOUND is practically muted as
the music ties one character to the next

Smiley sits in the middle of the destroyer Other Maras
mingle around him but he doesn’t look at them He stares
past us absently as if he were looking at something 1000
yards away

EXT RIO SUCHIATE GUATEMALA - DAY

Orlando on the same river we began the film steps onto a
raft with a small group of immigrants

His face shows the fatigue from the journey but there is
nothing in his face that shows he’s going to give up

Around him other immigrants individuals and families make
their first steps on a journey he knows all too well

EXT RIO GRANDE - DAY

Sayra finishes dressing herself She washes her hands and
face in the river then disappears into the shrubs towards
the US

Willy’s lifeless face peeks from a closing PINE BOX COFFIN
A WORKER staple guns the lid shut

EXT POTTERS FIELD MCALLEN TEXAS - DAY 135

The same pine box is slid into a grave then filled with dirt
by a tractor A wooden cross reads “Sin Nombre” and is
surrounded by hundreds of similar wooden crosses marked with
the same “Sin Nombre”

EXT THE MARCHES OF MCALLEN - DAY 136

Sayra walks in a sort of trance through a field of tall
green grass and flowers Her face is both tired and
peaceful

As Willy described it there is something beautiful about the
Texan landscape like a painting especially in the early
light

EXT MCALLEN TEXAS - DAY 137

Sayra walks across a wide boulevard into the gigantic parking
lot of a super mall

She sees a pay phone on the sidewalk She stares at it She
decides to go to it

She picks up the receiver reads the info on the phone
written in Spanish on how to make COLLECT CALLS She dials
the number she was forced to memorize

SAYRA
(whispering to herself)
9-0-8-555-0-1-8-7

The muffled voice of an OPERATOR echoes through the line
Sayra is confused she answers in english “yes” with out
knowing what she is answering to

The phone begins to ring And ring And ring The VOICE of
Yessenia picks up the phone

SAYRA
Yessenia This is Sayra

As we pull high and away we loose her in the colorful mosaic
of hundreds of cars
