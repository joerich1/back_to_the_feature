EXT THE SKIES OVER CHICAGO - DAY

A vintage BI-PLANE wings over Chicago on a hot Summer day
pulling behind it a bright mylar BANNER “Marry Me Pam”

ROLL CREDITS as it passes landmarks—- the Sears Tower State
Street the Loop until it banks toward WRIGLEY FIELD

INT WRIGLEY FIELD STADIUM - THE PLAYING FIELD - SAME
A play’s in progress A Cub slides home he’s SAFE

IN THE STANDS—- the crowd goes nuts including GREG
donning a well-worn Cubs cap and PAM BURNS late 20’s and
smiling under the brim of her (hometown team) Yankees cap

PAMGREG
Wait to hustle Cubbies Yeah

They turn and do a one-hand high-five-low-five thing
then sit back down in their seats with their 5 beers

PAM
So still think baseballs boring

GREG
C’mon I never said boring I just
said someday they may need to add
something Liven it up a little

PAM
Like the NBA did with the 3 pt shot

81399 Pg

GREG
Exactly Nothing major maybe just a
live bull roaming the outfield

PAM
I like that He can run amok gore
some players graze between innings

GREG
«wand then it’s back to the bullpen

KRACK SOSA lines one to center and as Pam stands and
gives an ear-splitting two-fingered WHISTLE

Greg eyes his watch then pulls some Bushnell binoculars
from a case under his seat He eyes the skyline

BINOC POV A speck approaches from the West The plane

Greg lowers the binocs turns and gives a subtle nod to--
A VENDOR waiting at the top of the aisle He sees Greg’s
signal nods reaches in his pants pocket and pulls out--

A BOX OF CRACKERJACK its foil glinting in the-sun Then
he starts down the aisle lugging a box of PEANUTS

VENDOR
Peanuts Peanuts here Feed your
whole family for a buck

Greg settles back in his seat and drapes an arm around
Pam who’s busily filling in her program’s scorecard
He takes a deep breath The big moment’s finally here

GREG
Pam

PAM
Uh-huh

GREG
I love you

PAM

(looks up smiles)
I love you

This isn’t news just affirmation
GREG
I mean these last ten months have
just been the happiest of my life

PAM

81399 Pg

GREG
And I was thinking here we are
happy together in a place we both
love so maybe it’s time we y’know

VENDOR
CRACKERJACK

GREG

Greg motions to the Vendor who nods throws the box and--
A shirtless cardboard-beer-tray-hat-wearing FAN named
HOOTIE reaches up and SNAGS IT mid-air

HOOTIE

He slaps five with his BEER BUDDY beside him Greg pales

GREG
Hey hey that’s my Crackerjack
HOOTIE
Caim down buddy there’s more

Toss Chicken Little here a box
VENDOR

(shrugs to Greg)
Sorry Mister I tried
He turns and starts back up the aisle Greg jumps up--

GREG
But that’s my Crackerjack

--and starts squeezing past people’s knees toward Hootie

PAM
Honey it’s okay I don’t want it--

Greg keeps going Pam slumps in her seat embarrassed
and as Hootie puts a thumbnail to the foil package lid

GREG
Whoa whoa don’t open that

HOOTIE
What’s your problem asshole
81399 Pg

GREG
Look I really need that Crackerjack
There’s a surprise inside and--

HOOTIE

BEER-BUDDY laughs Hooty hoots and as Greg sweats—-
A PLANE ENGINE WHINES The plane’s turning about to buzz

GREG

He yanks out a Franklin A BEACH BALL banks off his head

GREG
Dammit

He leaps to the aisle tears open the packet and shakes
out a BRILLIANT DIAMOND RING Hootie sees this smacks
his Buddy’s head and as Greg drops to one knee right in
the aisle the ring in his hand and “Marry Me Pam” framed
perfectly behind him

They reach the top of their aisle Pam stops turns

PAM (contd)

Greg nods and smiles wan The moment’s dead

GREG
Sure

Pam turns and starts down the aisle Greg sighs opens his
fist and eyes the ring He was so close He pockets it
pulls out a Camel lights up and there’s a SQUEAL as--

A WOMAN runs arms out toward her beer-buying BOYFRIEND

WOMAN

PAM

He grins winks As they stop at the Metal Detector line

PAM
Greg you’re not really worried

GREG

wedding and Debbie and Dr Bob

She passes through the detector Greg waiting his turn

GREG (cont‘d)
Which is great because this way I
can show up meet everybody have
fun and just stay under the radar

BEEEEEEP Greg sets off the ALARM Heads jerk people
stare and a large no-neck SECURITY GUY approaches him
81399 Pg 8

SECURITY GUY
Step aside sir and empty your
pockets into the tray

GREG
(sees Pam is watching)
I can’t do that right now

SECURITY GUY
(pulls out magnetic wand)
Spread your arms and legs sir

GREG
Is this really necessary It’s not
like I said Ive got a bomb or—
(catching himself)
--jacket a bomber jacket y’know
like Indiana Jones wears

Greg winces amazed by his lameness The “wand” BEEPS as
it passes over his pants pocket Pam calls over to him

PAM

GREG
What No-- it’s an engagement ring
for my girlfriend and she’s right
over there so if I whip it out--

SECURITY GUY
Turn your back let me see it then
put it in your bag and on the belt

Greg does just that zipping the box into a bag side-pocket
and placing it on X-Ray conveyer belt Another wand-check

SECURITY GUY
He’s clear

And Greg steps through just in time to watch a SECURITY
WOMAN try to fit his bag in a carry-on-maximum-size-frame
eee

81399 Pg 9

SECURITY WOMAN
But his bag’s too big for carry-on
(slides bag to a SkyCap)
531 to New York LaGuardia Check it

The SKYCAP hands Greg a claim-check As he stares stunned
INT BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - LAGUARDIA - 3 HOURS LATER

Greg and Pam stand alone under a “Welcome To New York”
sign watching the chute of a now-empty carousel And as
“Flt 531” on the display flips to the next flight number

GREG
SHIT

INT “LOST LUGGAGE” COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER

Greg strides up to the lone LADY CLERK who’s just handed
a claim form to the MOTHER of a gurgling INFANT

GREG
Hi you lost my bag and there was a
two-carat diamond ring inside

CLERK
Sir I didn’t lose your anything But
£i11 out a form and if we can’t find
it we will compensate up to 1200

The baby SCREECHES in Greg’s ear

GREG
What The ring cost three times that

CLERK
I’m sure it did sir which is why we
urge all fliers to carry on valuables

GREG
Yeah well I was carrying it until
your damn airline made me check it
(desperation mode)
Look I really need that bag I’m
here for a wedding and afterwards I’m
going to propose to my girlfriend

CLERK
Sir put the address you’re staying
and we will ship it when it surfaces

The baby’s really cranky now-- crying gasping coughing
Mom tries burping him over her shoulder
81399 Pg

GREG (cont’d)
And what if it doesn’t Am I
supposed to spend the entire weekend
with just the clothes on my back

GYAAAK The baby PROJECTILE VOMITS all over Greg’s shirt

EXT ACCESS ROAD LEAVING LAGUARDIA - LATER

A teal Ford Taurus slogs its way through heavy traffic
INT THE TAURUS

Greg drives moping His shirt now completely wet

GREG
I still smell it Smell it

PAM
All I smell is Men’s Room soap And
maybe a hint of strained squash

GREG
I can’t believe they lost my bag

PAM
It’ll turn up And if doesn’t
1200 buys a lot of khaki Dockers

GREG
It’s not the money it’s the hassle
Havent you ever lost a bag before

PAM
No But then I’ve never checked one

GREG
How is that possible Every one has
to check a bag eventually

PAM
Not in my family Dad never let us
pack more than we could carry He
doesn’t trust people with his things

GREG
They don’t think it’s weird do they
that it’s taken so long to meet them

PAM
No They know how busy weve both
been And it’s not like Chicago to
New York’s a day trip It’s all fine
If anything waiting this long has
only made them want to meet you more

The Taurus turns into the drive on the side of the house
and parks next to the garage and the large backyard lawn
Greg and Pam get out Greg popping the trunk and getting
Pam’s bag He slams the trunk goes to pocket the key

GREG
Guess I better leave these here

and pulls out a half-smoked PACK OF CAMELS Pam wigs

PAM

smoking as a sign of weakness

GREG
I know-- I brought ‘em for the trip

PAM

Greg sighs hands ‘em over Pam looks around for a trash

EXT THE HOME’S ROOFTOP

«where they land and slide down some shingles before
stopping in a leaf-clogged gutter beside a big elm tree

EXT DRIVEWAY

GREG

I know they will

EXT BURNS HOME - FRONT PORCH - SECONDS LATER

The door flies open to reveal JACK AND DINA BURNS Jack’s
in his 50’s but hardly looks it Dina is similarly
attractive and both sport huge welcoming smiles
Immediately Jack and Pam rush to one another arms wide

81399 Pg

JACK PAM
Hey Sweet-Pea Daddy

They meet at the steps and embrace Pam pulling her legs
up behind her as Jack hugs her and eskimo-kisses her nose

JACK
Oh baby I missed you Pam-Cake

PAM
Missed you too Flap-Jack

They giggle like kids Dina “cutting in” to give Pama
peck on the cheek (then licking a finger to wipe off her
lipstick) as Jack heads for Greg smiling big hand out

JACK
Greg Or do you prefer Gregory
Jack Burns Pam’s Father

GREG
Hi Jack Great to finally meet you

Greg extends a hand and they shake Dina steps down

DINA
Hello Greg Welcome to Bayport

GREG
Thanks Dinah Dee-na darn--
(chagrined to Pam)
Saw that one coming didn’t we

DINA
Don’t worry happens all the time

JACK
(looks to driveway)
So what’re you driving there Ford

GREG
Yeah the new Taurus We were going
to rent a mid-size but I figured
hey I’m pulling down decent bucks
why not pop for a full-size car

Pam shoots him a smile knows he’s trying too hard

JACK
Interesting color You pick it

GREG
Oh no it’s just what the Hertz guy
gave me It’s some kind of green

81399 Pg 1€

JACK

They say geniuses pick green
DINA

What smells like old sour milk
PAM

Oh Greg got spit-up on by a baby
DINA

He didn’t
PAM

Yeah Mom he did
GREG

At the “Lost Luggage” counter
PAM

The airline lost Greg’s bag
DINA

They didn’t
PAM

Yeah Mom they did

JACK
Well you check your bag you take
your chances The airlines have
gone to hell since deregulation

DINA
I’m sure it’1ll turn up Meantime
Greg if you need anything just ask

JACK
(throws an arm around Greg)
Thats right Mi casa es su casa

GREG
Thanks Jack You too

He squints realizing that made no sense

JACK
(ushering them in)
Well check your feet everybody and
c’mon in We’ll have some drinks a
little snack-- Dee’s got a tray full
of pu-pu’s browning in the oven

DINA
Pu-pu’s Greg if you’re wondering
is Hawaiian for “hors d‘ouevre”
81399 Pg

GREG
Which I guess is French for
“pretentious snack”

DINA
(smiles at Greg impressed)
You know I never knew that
PAM
(shoots Greg a look)
Mom he was making a joke

DINA
Oh I see Yes that’s funny

And as Jack slams the door shut behind them
INT BURNS HOME - FOYER - CONTINUOUS
wa PERSIAN CAT runs over Jack scooping him up

JACK
Jinxy Hey buddy Hows my pal

Jack puts his face right up to the cat’s face mirroring
Jinxy’s expression as they both being to “mew”

JACK
Mew-mew-mew Look Jinxy your
sister’s here Pammy’s home

PAM

Greg meet Mr Jinx Jinx Greg
GREG

Hi Jinx
JACK

(stroking Jinx’s fur)
Greg-- Jinxy here’s strictly an
indoor cat so don’t let him out

DINA
Jack just taught Jinx to use the potty

PAM
You did Dad that’s so weird

JACK
What’s weird about it It’s nice not
having to smell a litter box

GREG
Wait you taught your cat to use the
toilet How’d you do that

81399 Pg 18

JACK
It was easy I designed a litter box
to fit inside the bowl and once he
got used to it I took the box away

DINA
Though I’m not sure Jinx likes it
Every chance he gets he tries to
dig squat and bury We had to
move all our potted plants outside

PAM
Forget Jinx-- I’m not sure I like it
Sharing the bathroom with a cat

GREG
Yeah and now there’s one more male in
the house to leave the darn seat up

JACK
Jinx can’t lift the seat He lacks
the strength and the opposable thumbs

GREG
(nods as if enlightened)
Oh that’s right

DINA
You a cat lover too Greg

PAM
No Greg hates cats

Whoops Pam instantly shoots Greg a “sorry” look

GREG
I uh wouldn’t say I “hate” them
I‘m just more of a dog lover

JACK
You can love dogs and not hate cats

GREG
That’s true but I grew up around
dogs and I don’t know cats just
seem to be more into themselves
(as Jinx MEOWS)
See Everything they say starts
with “me”

Jinx HISSES at Greg and leaps from Jack’s grasp scampering
up the stairs Jack turns and hands Pam’s bag to his wife

JACK
Dina honey run this bag upstairs
while I fix the kids some hi-balls
GREG
That‘’s okay Jack I can take it--

Too late Dina’s heading upstairs bag in hand

PAM
Oh and Mom Could you grab a clean
shirt from Denny’s for Greg to wear

DINA
Of course dear Be right back

JACK
So who’s ready for a drink

GREG
A drink sounds great thanks

PAM
You start I need a pit-stop I
haven’t tinkled since Chicago

She peels off for the hallway powderoom Greg shooting her
a “hurry back” look as Jack steers him to the kitchen

JACK
So Greg what’re you drinking I
got beer wine hard stuff

GREG
A beer sounds good

JACK
Denny’s at a friend’s so it’ll just
be the four of us tonight And I
guess you know Deb and Bob are still
in Denver visiting his relatives

INT THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

JACK (contd)
You like Bud Coors Becks Hatuey

GREG
Hatuey That’s a Cuban beer right

Jack pulls a pair of frosted-mugs from the freezer

JACK

Right When were you there
GREG

Sorry
JACK

When were you in Cuba drinking beer
btn

81399 Pg

GREG
Oh-- I wasn’t No see my old
roomie in college had this huge beer
collection and I remember he had
Hatuey but he only had one bottle
since it was so hard to get I
always wondered how it tasted

Jack opens the fridge to reveal a lone sixer of Bud

JACK
Gosh what do you know I’m fresh
out of Hatuey How ‘bout a Bud

He grabs two shuts the fridge starts to pour

JACK
Beer collection Yknow I collect
things too C’mon I’‘11 show you

INT JACK’S DENOFFICE - SECONDS LATER

A wood paneled room full of bookshelves big cherry-wood
desk cluttered shelves and walls full of framed photos

A leather chair and matching sofa-bed line one wall a
small bathroom another right beside a door that leads to
the home’s screened back porch

Greg beer in hand watches as Jack unlocks the latch of
an accordion-style vinyl door and slides it back to reveal
a niche in the wall the size of a walk-in closet

And as Jack flips a light on Greg gapes It’s not so
much a collection as a SHRINE To the CIA

A large enamel SEAL OF THE CIA hangs front and center
flanked by a framed portrait of (Former Agency Head)
William Colby and a PLAQUE bearing the CIA Creed “You
Shall Know The Truth and The Truth Shall Set You Free”

GREG
Wow

JACK
Some guys have trains or stamps I
collect intelligence memorabilia

He flips another switch and illuminates glass cases and
shelves displaying 50-plus years of Cold War Gadgetry
Cypher Machines Listening Devices Various “concealed”
weapons-- eg a briefcase rifle and a walking cane with a
hidden dagger handle Another wall has a trio of framed
“data printouts” alongside photos of three infamous SPIES

GREG
Are those what’s the word polygrams

JACK
Polygraphs right And those arent
copies-- they’re original read-outs
(pointing to print-outs)
Thats Alger Hiss Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg Aldrich Ames and the
very data that sealed their fate

GREG
Hey Jack just how accurate is your
average polygram Because I’ve
heard people say they’re really not
That y’know people can beat them

JACK
(smiles amused)
You‘ve “heard that” huh In truth
it’s extremely hard to fool a
reliable machine and an experienced
case officer Let me show you why

He gestures to a chair and as Greg takes a seat Jack
opens a drawer to reveal a POLYGRAPH MACHINE And while
the majority of Jack’s collection is “vintage” this
particular piece looks state-of-the-art and barely used

JACK (cont’d)
An Agency-sanctioned model like this
measures response on three levels
He holds up what looks like a blood-pressure cuff

JACK (cont’d)
It has a cuff to gauge your Cardio

«and casually velcros it around Gregs left arm
GREG
Oh hey Just like the blood pressure
cuffs we use in the hospital
Jack pulls out a larger strapbelt with two outputs
JACK
It has two sets of “pneumos” to read
and record respiratory activity

He slips the belt around Greg’s torso and cinches it

GREG
nd Wow That‘’1ll make you nervous
81399 Pg 22

JACK
And these thimbles on your fingertips
will chart Galvanic Skin Response

GREG
as Jack slides them on)
You mean like sweat

JACK
More than sweat Neuro-chemical
reactions in and under the skin

He flips the machine on its console lighting up and five
“pens” centering on five lines of the graph paper which
starts to roll the pens marking an initial base reading

JACK (contd)
So with this many bases covered you
can see it’s not an easy tool to fool

GREG
Oh definitely

JACK
Pam tell you I was in the CIA

GREG
What

ON THE GRAPH-- all five pens skate across the paper

JACK
The CIA I retired last year

GREG
No kidding Wow congratulations

He glances at his richter-response to Question One Shit

JACK
She didn’t mention that huh

GREG
What That you were retired
(as pens spike again)
YES yes she did mention that She
definitely said you were retired

JACK
From the CIA

GREG
(knows he’s fucked so)
OUCH Jack OW Can we turn this
thing off I think the cardio cuff
seam’s right on my bicipital artery
81399 Pg

JACK
(undoing cuff)
Oh jeez I’m sorry Maybe I didn’t
put it on right

GREG
(unstrapping pneumos)
No I’m sure you did it’s just I
have a low threshold for pain
(pulling off GSR thimbles)
But thank you for showing me that
It’s really an amazing machine

JACK
Yes it is People who know will tell
you the polygraph is the single most
important tool in the perpetual fight
against the evils of penetration

He flips the machine off then the shrine’s lights and
they step out shutting the accordion door behind them

JACK
Let’s find Pam and see what’s keeping
Dee Whaddya bet she made a pit-stop

GREG
All I know is I can smell her pu-
pu’s and I bet they’re brown

JACK
What

GREG
Dina’s hors d’ouevres In the oven

The OVEN TIMER sounds upstairs Greg saved by the buzzer

JACK
Oh-- the snacks Jesus I give her
one little thing to do
(turns heads for kitchen)
Dina The Pu-Pu’s honey let’s go
(whirls back to Greg)
C’mon Greg Its Happy Hour

INT BURNS HOME “GREAT ROOM” - MOMENTS LATER

Take a Family Room remodel it and suddenly it’s “Great”
This particular GR is open to the kitchen and also
features a large SCREENED PORCH overlooking the backyard

BY THE ENTERTAINMENT CENTER - Jack flips through a highly-
organized (alphanumeric and by theme) CD RACK until he
finds the appropriate disk “MUSIC FOR COCKTAILS” while

2
81399 Pg

GREG
What’s that-- what’s Three Questions

PAM

A profiling technique They ask you
three questions in a row If you only
answer the first two it won’t work
But if you answer the third that’s
it They somehow know all about you

(beat opens screen door)
My Dad explained it to me once but
I didn’t really get it Look just
try to relax okay They like you

INT THE GREAT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

They step back inside Jack now standing at the wet-bar

JACK

Pamcake I made you a spritzer
PAM

Good call Pop Thanks
JACK

Greg-- how ‘bout another drink
GREG

Sure Jack
JACK

What’1l you have

GREG
Oh whatever you’re having

JACK
Tom Collins How do you like it

That’s three Greg shoots a panicked look to Pam

PAM
Pour him a stiff one Daddy
(sotto to Greg)
Might loosen you up a bit

JACK
(pouring the booze)
Greg it might look I’m making it
weak but I’m using Tom Collins Cubes

He holds up an ice-cube tray filled with yellow-green
“Collins” cubes plopping them into a glass with vodka

JACK (cont’d)
Using ice just dilutes your booze

81399 Pg

IN THE KITCHEN - Dina arranges a pu-pu platter and

ON THE BACK PORCH - Greg and Pam stand at the railing
enjoying a view of the lush and spacious Burns backyard

Greg looks anxious Even more so considering he is now
wearing Denny’s “INSANE CLOWN POSSE” t-shirt featuring a
pair of bloody-fanged Bozos atop a flaming pentagram

GREG
«next thing I know I’m all hooked
up and he’s asking me questions

PAM
What kind of questions

GREG
Like did I know he was in the CIA

PAM
No What’d you say

GREG
Nothing I lied

PAM
You lied Greg--

JACK
(calling heading for bar)
Happy hour kids Come’n’get happy

PAM
(calling back)
In a second Daddy
(to Greg concerned)
You lied to my Fathers polygraph

GREG
I didn’t know what else to do You
told me not to tell him you told me
and now your Dad thinks I’m a liar

PAM

(sighs then consoling)
Look don’t worry he shows that
stupid polygraph to everyone-- it’s
like a toy to him Believe me if
Dad wanted to pick your brain he

Dina walks over with a pu-pu platter (egg rolls pizza
rolls bagel-bites) and as they all gather ‘round
Pam smiles happy this moment is finally here

PAM
Well this was long overdue Toast

JACK
Terrific idea Pam A toast to the
future Dr and Mrs Banks

DINA
And a wonderful wedding and weekend

They toast Pam smiling despite this not being what she
had in mind And as all four “clink” drink and sit

GREG
So Bob’s last name is “Banks”

DINA
Right Dr Robert Banks Isn’t it
fantastic Deb can keep her initials

JACK
Plus now we can give them my
Mother’s monogrammed silver set

PAM
(another dream dashed)
Wow that’s really generous Ive
always loved Grandmothers silver

JACK
Your Nana had taste Love you Ma

He raises his glass to the fireplace mantel where a PHOTO
OF MOM hangs above an URN marked “Burns” The family joins
him Pam shooting Greg a “do it” look and as they all sip

DINA
You have a unique last name Greg
We were curious how it’s pronounced

GREG
Just like it’s spelled F-O-C-K-E-R

JACK AND DINA
“Focker”

GREG
Jahohl Ich bein ein Focker
(off their blank stares)
That’s German Focker’s German

They nod Pam slightly horrified switches subjects

PAM
So Greg how’s your job

GREG
(kinda confused she’s asking)
«good Pam Thanks for asking
(then to parents)
I just got transferred to Triage

DINA
(sits up hopeful)
Oh is that better than a nurse

PAM
Mom Triage is a unit in the ER
All the top nurses work Triage

GREG
ER work is such an adrenaline rush
I mean on top of the high you get
naturally just from helping people

DINA
You know Jack’s new career is
helping people too Honey did you
show Greg your “Nanny Cams”

JACK
Not yet Sit tight let me show you

Jack’s up now heading for his TVVCR

JACK (cont’d)
I started a “home surveillance”
company Larry’s going in on it

DINA
Larry is Bob’s-- Debbie’s Bob’s—-
father and Linda’s husband Well
third husband so I guess that makes
her Debbie’s step-mom-in-law-to-be

No one cares Jack hits “Rewind” on the tape deck and
then plucks a big dopey-looking TEDDY BEAR off a shelf

JACK
Greg what’s this look like to you

He tosses Greg the teddy Greg looking slightly confused

GREG
A bear

Jack flips on the TV it flickers and ON THE TV--
A BandW image of Greg appears-- from the bear’s POV

81399 Pg 2

JACK
Smile you’re on Nan-ny Cam-ra

GREG
Oh wow I’ve seen these on TV
(laughs to Pam)
Remember that dopey sitcom we were
watching and the couple rented one
and forgot it was on--

JACK
This is nothing like a sitcom Greg
Inside this bear’s head is the
world’s smallest pinhole Zero-Lux
camera with a 900 Mhz transmitter
that sends to a lithium-powered VCR
It’s state-of-the-art all the way
custom-made by government contractors
exclusively for my company

GREG
(trying to recover)
Wow O-Lux and battery operated

He flips the bear upside down looking for the components
As he does the bears eyeball lens swings toward the
sofa where Dina’s sitting and

ON THE TV NOW-- is a perfect panty-shot up Dina’s skirt
Fortunately all eyes are on Greg

DINA
Did Jack tell you he’s ex-C1A

GREG
Yes actually he did mention that

JACK
And that’s not for broadcast I may
be retired but I still know things
that could end life as we know it

GREG
Not to worry I’m very discreet

Greg looks up to see DINA’S CROTCH looming large on the TV
screen He yanks the bear up before anyone notices

DINA
I must say it’s been interesting
being married to a spy Sometimes
Jack would leave at night and not
say where he’s going or the phone
would ring and he’d have to take it
in another room and lock the door
81399 Pg

PAM
Not to mention how he’d spy on me
ao and my dates

See

JACK
Now honey I never “spied”
“Observed” is more like it

He shoots a wink at Greg

PAM
Well Kevin and I got pretty tired of
you “observing” us on the back porch

JACK

Can’t blame a man for wanting to
know what goes on inside his own
house Greg-- my bear please

(as Greg tosses bear back)
Teddy here is our biggest rental but
weve got wall clocks mirrors
smoke-alarms and my latest-- a
pinhole camera that fits completely
inside an electrical outlet

A nearby PHONE rings Dina starts to rise

- DINA
7 I’‘1l get it

JACK
No no Dee You sit and and enjoy
your drink I’m already up
He gets up and starts for the kitchen Greg brightens

GREG
Hey maybe it’s the airline

DINA
I’m sure it is More pu-pus

GREG
Thanks but I’m pretty pu-pu’d out

ACROSS THE ROOM-- is a desk a corkboard full of wedding
info (guest lists seating charts etc) and a LAPTOP

GREG (cont‘d)
Nice laptop What kind of chip

DINA
Y‘know I don’t know I just finished
typing Jack’s itinerary for our super-

busy weekend I just need to proof

81399 Pg 30

GREG
Why don’t you just let your computer
proof it It must have a spell-check

DINA
It might but I’ve never used it

GREG
Oh Well I’m computer literate--

PAM
He’s practically an expert

GREG
--and Id be glad to run it for you

INT KITCHEN

Jack shuts the swinging door behind him grabs the phone

JACK
Hello Yeah I barely beat her to
the phone (pause) If she ever

does you just hang up quick okay
(turns to watch door)

So when are we getting together

Yeah I think I can swing it How

‘bout outside the Buy-Rite Good

He takes the bottle of Buy-Rite Collins mix from the
counter and starts pouring it down the sink

JACK (cont’d)
I’m excited too See you in a bit

INT GREAT ROOM - IN DINA’S “OFFICE”
Greg’s at the laptop Pam and Dina standing behind him

GREG
“No misspelled words found” How
about that Looks like you’re a
letter-perfect typist Dina

Jack re-enters from the kitchen

DINA
Was it the airline honey

JACK
What No wrong number
(holds up empty bottle)
And were out of Collins Mix I’m
gonna make a run to the Buy-Rite
81399 Pg 31

GREG
Jack mind if I tag along I just
realized if my bag doesn’t come by
tonight I‘11l need a few essentials

JACK
I’m sure it’ll come Airlines have
never been sharper Stay Relax

PAM
Oh Greg Can you pick me up a
scrunchy I forgot to pack one

JACK
Honey Buy-Rite has no scrunchies
(then backing off)
I mean they didn’t last I looked

PAM
Whey were you looking for a scrunchy

JACK
(changes tack gaslighting)
I wasn’t looking for kim-chee dear
why on Earth would I want that

GREG
‘“Kim-chee” The Korean sauerkraut

PAM
Not kim-chee Dad A scrunchy

JACK
Ohhhh well they might have that
You coming Greg If so let’s go

He jangles his car-keys and heads off down the hall

GREG
Be right back

He turns and follows Jack A beaming Dina turns to Pam

DINA
Oh Pam he seems wonderful

PAM
He is Mom He’s such a great guy

DINA
And you two have been together
almost a year now Have you been
thinking about anything permanent
ed

And as the two women give a little squeal and embrace

INT

PAM
Well Greg and I haven’t exactly
discussed it but-- yes I’d say were
absolutely thinking “permanent”

JACKS 1998 BUICK - ROLLING THROUGH SUBURBIA - DAY

8

They ride in deafening silence Greg subtly struggling to
strike up a conversation Finally

Car rides smooth

GREG JACK
Big day Saturday

JACK
This little to-do’s gonna set me back
20 gs We’re expecting two hundred

GREG
Two hundred That’s great
considering the short notice

JACK
Yeah it’s been tricky with a three-
week engagement but you know when
it’s right you don’t need time to
think about it Dina and I married
two months after we met and next
month is our 25 anniversary

GREG
Twenty-five Congratulations

JACK
I was a lucky man the day I met Dina

GREG
That’s kind of the way I feel about
Pam In fact I’m glad we have a
moment to talk here Jack because--

JACK
How come you don‘t like cats

GREG
(beat taken aback)
It‘s not that I don’t like them I
just happen to prefer dogs more
(continues off Jack’s stare)
Because I think it’s nice y’know to
come home and they’re there wagging

their 1i‘l tail all happy to see you
81399 Pg 33

JACK
You need that assurance do you You
prefer an emotionally shallow animal

GREG

JACK
See Greg if you yell at a dog his
ears will go down and his tail will
covers his genitals even if he’s
done nothing wrong It’s very easy
to break a dog But cats make you
work for their affection You can
scold or threaten a feline and never
know if you’re getting through
because a cat protects its pride
Cats don’t “sell out” like dogs do

GREG

Huh Maybe I was wrong about cats
JACK

And a cat won’t kiss your ass for

acceptance
(hitting play on CD)
You like Peter Paul and Mary

Greg hesitates not sure whether to be honest or to kiss
Jack’s ass for acceptance Puff the Magic Dragon comes on

GREG
Sure “Puff the Magic Dragon” You
know I actually wrote a paper about
this song back in college About
how it’s y’know about weed

JACK
What

This is clearly news to Jack But Greg’s committed so

GREG
That “puff the magic dragon” meant
to light up take a hit And to
bury that in a kiddy sing-a-long
song—- man that took some guts

JACK
But “Puff” was just the name of the
boys magical dragon
(ejects CD turns and stares)
Are you a pothead Greg

81399 Pg

GREG
What No I mean sure I’ve had
offers who hasn’t but believe me
I just say no I pass on grass I
strongly agree with the late Mr T
when he said “Dope is for dopes”

Jack stares then gives a little nod as if convinced but
it’s clear he is not And as Greg slumps in his seat

JACK
Mr T’s not dead

EXT BUY-RITE SUPERSTORE - DAY

Greg and Jack walk by some some coin-operated KIDDY RIDES
and FUN-HOUSE MIRRORS enroute to the sliding front doors

JACK
Meet you back out front

INT BUY-RITE

Greg turns one way Jack the other Then a few seconds
later Jack returns and slips out the entrance

DOWN AN AISLE-- Greg passes a shelf of Kim-Chee before
heading for the Pharmacy area where he finds a sign
“ALL NICOTINE PATCHES ON SALE” above an empty shelf
He turns to a CLERK at the nearby pharmacy register

GREG
Do you have more nicotine patches

CLERK
No We have the gum You chew it

He points to a shelf of Nicorette Gum Greg takes a box

GREG
Oh and what’s the most expensive of
champagne you sell

CLERK
Korbel On sale for 899

He points to a nearby Korbel display Greg walks over
grabs a bottle and then he suddenly stops and stares

WOMAN and her idling Lexus She’s blonde 40s built
and as she gets out of the car and she and Jack HUG

GREG

right time to tell her and we can
stop sneaking around like this

CAROL

A quick peck and she’s back in her Lexus pulling away
But as she passes the pillar Jack spies something
A two-foot-tall three-foot-wide GREG seen from behind

JACK
Focker

BEHIND THE PILLAR-- Gregs confused-- how was he spotted
Then he spins and sees a short fat Jack coming his way
The fun-house mirrors Lightning fast Greg puts his bag
down and grabs a magazine from atop the newsrack And as
he hides his face behind an issue of “PARENTING” magazine

JACK

Greg whips it down smiling as if nothing’s happened

GREG
Oh hey Jack Ready to go

always winds up being you

JACK
Not always How about it Greg

GREG
Thanks but I’ve never done it

GREG
Mmmm y’ know I can’t remember the
last time I had a real sit-down
home-cooked family dinner like this

JACK
Maybe back growing up on the farm

PAM
(squints confused)
I thought you grew up in Detroit

DINA
Does Detroit have many farms

GREG
Not really but our house was big
and red and we had a lot of pets

JACK
Which one did you milk
PAM
(disgusted)
Dad--
JACK

Honey he said he’d pumped milk

PAM
What have you ever milked

TABLE NOW-- Jinx brushes against Greg’s shin

GREG
AW cat actually My sister’s cat
had kittens and I got bored one day
and so I kind of milked her

DINA
I didn’t know you could milk a cat

GREG
You can milk anything with nipples

JACK

GREG
Uh sure Jack I guess I could
Men are fully capable of lactation

not about men’s nipples or milk

There’s a beat as they consider another topic Then

DINA
So Greg How do you like nursing

INT DOWNSTAIRS POWDER ROOM - LATER

An anxious Greg pops the last piece of Nicorette from its
packet and adds it to A PILE on the counter Then he
starts destroying evidence tearing the box into strips

PAM (0S THROUGH DOOR)
Honey we’re starting

GREG
Okay babe Be right out

He turns drops the paper into the bowl flushes

PAM(OS)
Oh and Dad says go easy on the
paper We’re on a septic tank here

Greg eyes the bowl IT’S CLOGGING water rising fast

GREG
Oh God oh no

He pulls the tiny shag rug away yanks thelid off the top
of the tank and plunges an arm in hoping to shut the
flapper No luck And as the water reaches the brim and
Greg steps back mortified to await the ensuing flood

SSKKWWOO the clog (mercifully) bursts the water swirling
dropping and disappearing with a GURGLE A beat and

Greg sags relieved pops a HANDFUL OF GUM then chews and
sighs feeling the rush relaxing for the first time today

INT GREAT ROOM

SCRABBLE Pam eyes her tiles and the board contemplating
her next move as beside her Greg does the same anxiously
chewing and nervously bouncing a knee-- wired on the gum

Across from them-- Jack watches the board and snacks on
dessert-- a plate of homemade cookies-- while Dina works
busily filling out a stack of WEDDING GUEST PLACECARDS

JACK
Greg you can always just “pass”

GREG
(looks up flustered)
Oh is it my turn God I’m sorry

And as he shuffles his tiles around racking his brain

PAM
Mom Can I help you with those

DINA
No thanks sweety Your Dad wants
all the handwriting to match

GREG
Anal

Pam turns freaked But then she sees Greg’s just spelled
“anal” on the board He looks up reads her expression

GREG
What That’s a word

PAM
I know it’s a word It’s just

JACK
pretty B-A-D What’s with these
words Focker “Anal” “bee” “hat”
Can’t be monosyllabic if you want to
beat the Scrabblin’ Burns of Bayport

GREG
Uh okay thanks for the tip

He smiles nods shoots an “I hate games” look to Pam
then pulls three new tiles and slides them onto his wooden
tile-holder Dina’s turn now She builds ona “j”

‘Jaialai”
(oddly apologetic to all)
Sorry I had all those a’s Go Pam

And as Dina marks her score down and pulls more tiles
Pam eyes the board then sees Greg pop another Nicorette

PAM

Oh Well thanks for sharing And
for remembering to get my scrunchy

GREG
The champagne Shoot I forgot
it’s still chilling in the kitchen

And as he gets up and heads for the kitchen

JACK
Why are we having champagne again

PAM
Because Dad-- Greg wanted to buy a
little gift It’s a gesture

And as she plays her turn Greg breezes back with an icy
bottle of Brut four glasses and a dinner napkin draped
on his wrist He circles the table placing the glasses

GREG
Sorry for holding up the game

Jack shoots Greg a look building on an “I”

JACK
Intruder Go Greg

GREG
Right after I pop the bubbly Jack

And as he wraps the bottle in a linen dinner napkin

DINA
Pam did you hear how Doctor Bob
proposed They went to eat at their
favorite restaurant and he slipped the
ring into Deb’s glass of champagne

PAM
Thats so sweet And just the right
touch I can’t stand it when people
make a production out of it like
buying a billboard or something If
you have to try that hard

Greg eagerly “presents” the bottle label-out waiter-
style As Jack nods polite but totally indifferent

PAM (cont‘d)
Her ring nice Can‘t wait to see it

JACK
Oh youve seen it

PAM
Dad how could I have seen it I

JACK
Well you haven’t seen the exact

still talking to me

He sits on the bed depressed Pam sits beside him

PAM

Which is why Ward got a love-nest

Nothing I just wish your Dad would
trust us And not be so hung-up on

He checks out a wall of PHOTOS the various MUSIC from the
TV upstairs tenderly “underscoring” each picture Theres
dozens of photos but most are of Jack and Pam over the
past 20-odd years hugging smiling and generally looking
happy Then to the strains of “Lollipops and Roses” (as

INT DENNY’S ROOM

A dark cluttered STY lit only by the sun peaking through
wind-blown blinds The unmade bed empty Greg leans in

GREG
Hello

He looks around and then satisfied Denny’s not here he
heads for the ransacked closet and chest of drawers He
opens a drawer finds clean boxers drops his robe and—
A HEAD shoves through the blinds DENNY’S

DENNY AND GREG
Aaaah

Nude Greg cups the boxers to his crotch

GREG
Denny

DENNY
Outta my room dickless

He sweeps the blinds aside to reveal he’s standing on the
garage roof And as leans over and starts climbing in

Greg spins and slides the shorts on as Denny falls inside
with a THUD A beat then Denny slowly gets to his feet

GREG
Hi Denny I’m Pam’s boyfriend—-

DENNY
Are you wearing my boxers

GREG
Yeah the stupid airline lost my bag
so Pam said I should borrow clothes

Denny pulls a tiny can of “Ozium” deodorizer from his
jacket pocket and sprays his reaking clothes head-to-toe

DENNY

Greg lets this slide watching as Denny tosses his jacket
atop an old Nordic-Trak that’s been “modified” A length
of surgical tubing and an ace bandage hang between its

ski-poles the “sling” facing the bedroom’s front window

GREG
How do you like your Nordic-Trak

DENNY
It Nordic-blows I used it for
maybe a week Now it’s a water-
condom catapult If two guys pull
the sling back you can nail the
church playground a block away

GREG
Really That’s rad Denny could
I grab more clothes If you want to
pick them out for me that’s cool

Denny pushes past Greg into the closet and finds a pair of
black polyester “slacks” (tags still on them) and a pair
of black dress socks Then he finds an old pile of
shirts digs and pulls out Milli Vanilli World Tour ‘92
with a rendering of the two dancin’ dreadlocked shysters
And as he tosses the all-black ensemble to Greg

DENNY (cont’d)
Youre styling Rock on

And as Greg looks up mid-chew to find everyone staring

INT GREAT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

GREG
Well since you’re asking I pretty
much feel like a big dumb loser

PAM
You’re not a loser Greg It’s just
too bad you had to hit it so hard

GREG
Pam it was an accident

81399 Pg

PAM
I know but you shouldn’t have let
Dad and Larry push you like that--

GREG

PAM

GREG

PAM

GREG

PAM
At being yourself Greg do you not
understand how important this
weekend is to me To us

GREG
Of course But Pam if you want me
to be comfortable to be myself then

Im feeling totally alone here

He sits on edge of the sofa-bed dejected
Pam immediately beside him consoling

PAM
Greg baby I’m on your side
You’re not on your own here

She puts an arm around him pulls him close He turns to
her nodding feeling better They kiss Pam leaning them
back onto the bed and placing his hand to her chest

GREG

PAM
It’s fine relax

And as she starts to straddle him kissing hands roaming
BAM The door flies open to reveal Jack and Larry holding
linens Greg bolts up his hands on Pam’s breasts

PAM

Jack shoots Larry daggers as Pam gets up

PAM
This is Greg’s room Dad

JACK

PAM
Then where’s he supposed to sleep

JACK
We’1l talk about it later Meantime
head outside and help your Mother

PAM
Fine C‘mon Greg

She huffs and exits to the porch Greg shoots a sheepish
look to Jack and Larry and starts to go when Jack notices
the bathroom door is ajar And something’s running

JACK
Hold it Focker
(listens points to bathroom)
Did you flush this toilet

GREG
No sir

JACK
What did the thing flush itself

GREG
Wait-- the cat He used the toilet

LARRY
The cat used the toilet

GREG
Last night he flushed it and left

JACK
No chance Jinx knows not to use
this toilet And he never flushes
GREG
Well he did last night and what’s
it matter anyway

JACK
The matter Greg RN is that when
this toilet is flushed it runs
And when you have a septic tank
that’s nearly full and a toilet that
has run all night then you can
suddenly have one helluva problem

Suddenly two concerned Workers appear in the doorway

GREG

INT BURNS HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Greg alone walks and talks on the cordless smoldering

GREG
I know I said a gray American
Tourister but is it possible their

turn a profit manufactured more than

fine airline to lose two of the
aforementioned receptacles and ina
synergistic explosion of irony and
incompetence send the wrong one here
while sending the right one to the
other sucker who was dumb enough to
let you check his only carry-on bag

He swings the back door open and steps outside to--
EXT THE BACK PORCH

--where he paces Bob and Kevin visible in the bg
watching a HUGE TOW-TRUCK pull the flatbed from the muck

He turns heads back for the door and then stops And
pales Jinx is there meowing at him OUTSIDE

GREG
Oh God Here kitty Here Jinx

Jinx stares licks a paw And as Greg creeps closer
Jinx bolts down the stairs Greg LEAPS from the porch
cutting him off Jinx turns and bolts for a crawl-space
hatch disappearing UNDER THE HOUSE As Greg steams

A quick hug then it’s time to get back to business

DINA

Debbie nods and leaves Dina shutting the door behind her
And as she takes a moment to absorb what’s just happened

He whips the wheels bombing across traffic lanes and

crinkling a plastic cap “popping” a ball rattling around
inside a can an aerosol HISS and the WAIL of a cat

A handsome couple flanked by their families gather in the
shadow of an elm holding hands and smiling as a PRIEST

If you say so Jack

JACK
I do say so And so does my Jinxy

continues the waltz and Dina fields another PHONE CALL
Jack suddenly stops and feels the tip of the cat’s tail

PAM
What’s the matter Dad

JACK
Something sticky got on his tail

GREG
Probably road tar The Cat-Catcher

JACK
Jinxy-- what’s come over you

He starts to follow but as the cat bolts past Dina

BOB
Hope you like it Riles It’s hard

KEVIN
Well almost everything

He shoots a none-too-subtle look Pam’s way who looks
down clearly uncomfortable and as the moment hangs

Poor Kevin I don’t know what I was

getting back together again

GREG

The guy seems damn near perfect

PAM
He is perfect And the idea of
spending the rest of my life with
someone who’s so together that the
only person he needs in his life is
himself well who needs that I
need a relationship I can bring
something to a man I can change
someone at least as screwed up as me

And I know just the guy

He grins big pointing a finger at his big grinning face

Oh what’s it matter I’ve destroyed
my Debbie-Doodle’s wedding day

Impostor Cat dropping from Jack’s lap to the floor

Greg feeling guilty moves closer to Jack He raises a
hand hesitates then places it awkwardly on Jack’s heaving
shoulder patting him lightly as if burping a baby

GREG
It’s okay Jack It’1l work out

Touched Jack looks up his eyes welling with gratitude

JACK
Greg thanks for being here for me

And you said back at dinner there

From what
JACK

He destroyed our family You saw
what happened in there--

PAM
Yeah and God knows why a nice guy
like Greg Focker would want to join
a fucked-up family like ours
You’re not trying to protect me
Dad You’re trying to keep me

She says this with such conviction and clarity that Jack
is completely shut down And as the moment hangs

A number of WEDDING-RELATED VANS pull into the driveway
Followed by a WHITE VAN the Driver calling to Greg

VAN DRIVER
Mr Gregory I got your bag

And as he holds up a lime-green Samsonite
GREG
Thanks listen you going back to
LaGaurdia Because I need a ride

VAN DRIVER
Uh sure Hop in

Greg spins to Pam Reaches a hand to her

GREG

Pam c’mon Come with me
JACK

GREG

She takes Greg’s hand her eyes on Jack her heart breaking

PAM

He reaches out and takes Pam’s other hand

JACK

PAM
I know Let me go Dad

(almost a whisper)
Let go

Jack drops her hand Pam nods turns and climbs in
INT THE VAN

Sharing the seat with a much-relieved Greg They pull
away Pam watching Jack shrink in the dirty side-mirror

and as she turns to Greg and musters a bittersweet smile

EXT BURNS HOME - FRONT YARD

Jack is distraught in pain He paces a circle stops
then sits on the front lawn steps breaking down a few
feet away from a MALE FLORIST unloading his van

Seeing this the Florist ambles over concerned

MALE FLORIST
Mr Burns Are you okay

JACK
(looks up eyes wet)
My daughter I’ve lost my daughter

MALE FLORIST
(patting Jack’s back)
Now now You’re gaining a son

They look up as a car arrives Teal Taurus BOB INSIDE

BOB
Hey Mr B This is it the big day

JACK
(stands irate)
Where the hell’ve you been

BOB
Scoring breakfast
(steps out with donut box)
I got up early got a bakers dozen

there Nice of him to leave a note

And as Jack looks beyond him to the teal rental car

looks with his pillow hair and “Hello Kitty” tux-ensemble

INT AIRPORT - TICKET COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER
Pam and Greg stare numb as a CLERK hands them tickets

AIRPORT ANNOUNCER (V0O)

They push their stools out turn and head for the gates
But then Pam peels off for the adjacent Ladies Room

PAM
Hang on Pit-stop

She ducks inside Greg waiting and leaning up against a
wall knees bent eyes shut massaging his temples
feeling the strain And when he opens his eyes

JACK IS THERE in his face He places a hand on Greg’s
shoulder and looks him right in the eye Pupil-to-pupil

JACK

Three questions Where’s Pam
GREG

Restroom
JACK

GREG
With all my heart

JACK
(nods then)
Can you forgive me
81399 Pg 121

GREG
Absolutely

A beat then Jack smiles and pulls Greg into a warm honest
embrace Greg breathes again his color returning and as
he looks over Jacks shoulder out the window to the tarmac

OUTSIDE - ON AN ABANDONED SECTION OF TARMAC

An area’‘s cordoned off with yellow police tape In the
middle of it all sits a LONE SUITCASE A grey Tourister

GREG
Jack hang on

He breaks the hug and moves toward the window where a
CROWD of onlookers have gathered to watch the action

GREG
Whose suitcase is that

CURIOUS ONLOOKER
No one’s-- they found it abandoned
so they’re blowing it up

Greg looks a few hundred yards “down-range” where theres
a blue “NYPD BOMB SQUAD” Van and a mess of NEWS REPORTERS

GREG
THATS MY BAG

He spins and runs through an exit door An ALARM sounds

JACK
Greg-- wait--

JACK
(hops down badge out)
Relax boys CIA

100 YARDS AWAY-- Greg face down and clothes smoldering
coughs and cowers in a cloud of smoke and debris

But when he finally looks up something small and on fire
is tumbling toward him almost as if it were sentient

It stops mere inches from his blast-blackened face And
even ablaze you can see it’s a box A tiny velvet box
Greg blows it out picks it up opens it The Ring

He turns sees Jack coming and as he flashes a thumbs-up

We hear “Leaving On A Jet Plane” by Peter Paul and Mary
EXT BURNS HOME - BACKYARD - AFTERNOON

A hundred-odd people watch Debbie (white sundress) and Bob
(Dockers Polo shirt) hold hands and run a gauntlet of
flying birdseed to the driveway and an idling limousine

AT THE LIMO-- Greg Pam Denny and the parents cheer and
throw seed Jack holding Jinx and sniffling MThen--
Debbie raises her bouquet and a handful of WOMEN surge
forward screaming Debbie winds up to throw then turns--

DEBBIE
Here Sis

--and flips it a few feet to Pam Greg’s brilliant diamond
shining brightly on her finger The sisters smile Deb
gets in the limo and as Denny shuts the door

The car roars away trailing a “Just Married” sign and tin
cans Larry and Linda (black eye split-lip) turn to
Jack Dina (wrist-splint) and Greg and Pam

LARRY
A toast To the newlyweds

DINA
And to being grandparents

Pam Greg and the four new in-laws grin clink and drink
Then Jack raises his glass to propose yet another

JACK
And to Pam and to Greg our next son

81399 Pg 12

They toast Jack leaning to peck Greg on the cheek Then

JACK (cont’d)
C’mon everybody let’s cut a rug

Dina Jack and the Banks head for the fast-filling dance
floor Greg and Pam follow walking slowly arm in arm

GREG
I think it was a beautiful wedding

PAM
Me too How soon can we elope

They laugh share a kiss and glide onto the parquet just
as the Dee-Jay spins another record Hey-- it’s that cool
and romantic Gershwin tune the DJ winking Greg’s way
GREG
As soon as you want There’s just
one thing you need to do first

PAM
What’s that

GREG
Meet my parents

Pam smiles and as they kiss and dance to their song it’s

THE END
