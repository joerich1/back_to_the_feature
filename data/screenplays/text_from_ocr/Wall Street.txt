EXT WALL STREET - EARLY MORNING

FADE IN THE STREET The most famous third of a mile in the
world Towering landmark structures nearly blot out the
dreary grey flannel sky The morning rush hour crowds swarm
through the dark narrow streets like mice in a maze all in
pursuit of one thing MONEY CREDITS RUN

INT SUBWAY PLATFORM - EARLY MORNING

We hear the ROAR of the trains pulling out of the station
Blurred faces bodies suits hats attache cases float into
view pressed like sardines against the sides of a door which
now open releasing an outward velocity of anger and greed
one of them BUD FOX
EXT SUBWAY EXIT - MORNING

The bubbling mass charges up the stairs Steam rises froma
grating shapes merging into the crowd Past the HOMELESS
VETS the insane BAG LADY with 12 cats and 20 shopping bags
huddled in the corner of Trinity Church

Bud the Fox straggling behind in a crumpled raincoat tie
askew young very young his bleary face buried in a Wall
Street Journal folded subway style as he crosses the
street against the light

BUD
Why Fox Why didnt you buy
schmuck

A car honks swerving past
INT OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Cavernous modern lobby Bodies cramming into elevators Bud
stuffing the newspaper into his coat jams in

INT ELEVATOR - MORNING

Blank faces stare ahead each lost in private thoughts Bud
again mouthing the thought stupid schmuck his eyes

catching a blond executive who quickly flicks her eyes away
Paranoia in the elevator We quickly cut into private lives

WORRIED MAN (VO)

million and hell get a million

BLACK BIKE MESSENGER (VO)
» gotta get Lola in the sack man

Terrells Jimmy give me the tickets

His eyes on the same blonde exec who looks away self-
conscious about her legs The elevator stops at a floor
discards only one person The doors close a little too slowly

BLONDE EXECUTIVE (VO)

(shifts her thoughts)

on the code are uncalibrated

Catching the eyes of Bud Fox once again wandering to her
Camera moving to Bud who looks away

BUD (VO)

»sorry what a fox funny the
most beautiful girls in the world

elevators never get to talk to
them shy my looks never had
confidence in them
overcompensating work syndrome

‘cept Im not making any money

(pause the elevator

at another floor slow)
wonder what all these people
are thinking about

Camera moving slowly again over the eyes The silence of
individual tension reigns over all

ANGRY MAN (VO)
»Screw him Ill destroy that
sonufabitch he thinks he can
break a contract with me hes got
something to learn

SECRETARY (VO)

»915 hell kill me this

eleven blocks

BLONDE EXECUTIVE (VO)
H2B2K1TCLP0T2
(pause she looks
like she forgot something)

WORRIED MAN (VO)
goddamn elevatorspeople too
many goddamn people in this world

The elevator finally comes to a slow stop They wait
plead beg screech with the eyes

The door at last opens None of them acknowledging each
other they all stampede out the door with an audible gasp
of release a collective sign akin to making it to a urinal
after a punishing wait

The elevator tension is over but the killer grind continues
INT JACKSON STEINEM INVESTMENT HOUSE - DAY

Credits continue to run Bud moves past the functional
reception area past CAROLYN a cheerful young black girl

CAROLYN
How you doing Buddy

BUD
Great Carolyn doing any better
would be a sin

He slips off his overcoat flicks some lint off his Paul
Stuart 500 suit and enters the main trading room

Brokers mill by their desks gulping coffee scanning the
papers the quotrons The digital clock by the big board
counter clicks to 926 am -- four minutes until the market
opens You can smell the hunger

Bud takes a deep breath tosses the newspaper away and
struts into the office -- fuck it -- its a new day

MOVING past DAN STEEPLES a flush-faced old-timer a blue
and white Yale tie with a carnation in his lapel

BUD
Morning Dan Whats looking good
today

STEEPLES

If I know I wouldnt be in this
business Get out while youre
young kid I came here one day I
sat down and look at me now

Past CHARLIE CUSHING on the phone a handsome chunk of man
with rugged good looks and Ivy League mannerisms

BUD
-hey Chuckie hows the woman-

slayer

CHARLIE
»Still looking for the right 18
year old wife how you doing pal

BUD

Bud reaches his trading desk whips open his briefcase and
pulls out a computer print-out of last nights homework

BUD
I gotta feeling were going to make
a killing today Marv

MARV (0OS)
Yeah wheres your machine gun

BUD
Joke about it I was up all night

His associate MARVIN a manicky wise-guy swivels over his
chair from a nearby desk He gives the charts a quick read

MARV

(scowling)
Looks bearish to me buddy You got
it all upside down

(confidential)
Okay Im giving this to you and
you alone ‘cause I feel sorry for

Bullets and my pick of the day --
Duke to beat the spread against
Wake Forest

BUD
Thanks Marv with that I might be
able to qualify for welfare

LOU MANNHEIM strolls in a dignified looking older broker
in his late 60s wearing an old brown brim hat with button
down white shirt narrow tie very much a picture from
another era a kind humor in his eyes but obviously
ailing in the legs and breath department

BUD
(friendly)
You got a look in your eye Mr
Mannheim You got something for
the small fry

MANNHEIM
Jesus cant make a buck in this
market countrys going to hell
faster than when that sonofabitch
Roosevelt was around too much
cheap money sloshing around the
world The biggest mistake we ever
made was letting Nixon get off the
gold standard Putney Drug--you
boys might want to have a look at it

MARV
Take 5 years for that company to
turn around

MANNHEIM
but they got a good new drug
Stick to the fundamentals thats
how IBM and Hilton were builtgood
things sometimes take time

The stentorian voice of OFFICE MANAGER HIERONYMUS LYNCH
booms over the intercom

We see him peering from behind the glass partition in hit
office tall balding with a perpetual worried look on his
face

LYNCH

Marvs direction)

BUD

The room rises to a subtle but new energy level with the
clatter of the ticker speakers teletype machines
newsprinters Dow Jones and Reuters phones ringing off the

A shot of CHARLIE CUSHING yawning as he half-listens to his
customer resting the phone on his kneecaps

DISSOLVE TO
THE CLOCK Its 230 pm We hear the relentless clatter

of the board ticker and the drone of disembodied voices
blarihg market information out of squawk boxes

Buds desk is now cluttered with order tickets literature
crumpled notes beverage cups and a half-eaten sandwich
Hes on the phone and from the look on his face the caller
on the other end is breaking his balls Marvin paces past
making a dramatic phone pitch

MARV
Dr Beltzer has to have his
information this minute It
concerns his future

Bud waves Marvin away answers his caller trying to keep
cool worried how as he sees Lynch the office manager
coming over

purposefully

INT GEKKO OFFICE - DAY

NATALIE a classy attractive Englishwoman is on the phone
with Bud somewhat amused by his manner She is the personal
secretary to multimillionaire Wall Street trader and
raider Gordon Gekko His windows look out on a panoramic
view of the city and East River

NATALIE
Mr Fox Ive told you before Im

bankers Yes I shall give him your
message

As theyre speaking another SECRETARY leads two well-heeled
JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN past her desk As she opens the door to
the inner office and ushers them inside we catch a glimpse
of a figure pacing back and forth talking animatedly on
the phone by the huge corner window HE IS GORDON GEKKO We

INT BUDS APARTMENT - UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT

A cramped studio facing an air shaft with bars on the window
Moving across to the sound of the radio alarm going off and
the glib tones of a rock DJ announcing the Mets latest
streak The walls are papered with stock analyses and
graphs print out pages strewn across the floor No other
semblance of a personal life except clothes haphazardly
tossed Barrons and Fortune magazines A GIRLs back is all
we see sleeping naked on the bed

Close on Buds IBM computer -- his appointment calendar Bud
focusing on an underlined notation GGs BIRTHDAY

compromise in her voice

INT GORDON GEKKOS OFFICE (BUDS POV) - DAY

Furnishings in hypermodern gray and black lacquer Modern
Art ranging from black field paintings by Ad Reinhardt to
the smashed dishes of Julian Schnabel Nautilus equipment
hi-tech gadgets are in evidence including a splendid Howard
Miller World Time Clock and a world map

Three of Gekkos people young MBAs dressed for success
are scattered about the room on phones calculators coming
in and out

GORDON GEKKO aka Gekko the Great as the media calls him
dressed in a custom English suit paces on the phone with
the restlessness of a caged tiger a 50-foot extension cord
attached to his blinking 130 line silver-plated telephone
On his ears is a headset

He is carrying on overlapping conversations with a myriad of
bankers partners and lawyers pausing to issue commands to
his aides while keeping his eye on the stock prides spitting
across a bank of quotron monitors carrying everything from
New York Exchanges to London commodities gold and
currency values A second Secretary and sometimes Natalie
exit and enter with various messages written on a piece of
paper indicating a waiting party on the phone Gekko often
shakes his head no

GEKKO

ALEX DE BETANCOURT a tall handsome Frenchman jots a note
and follows Gordon over to line 3 Gekkos dark intent eyes
fixing briefly on Bud who stands waiting in the corner He
motions him to sit

GEKKO

(to Alex)

Buds eyes on the framed tombstones from the Wall Street
Journal commemorating Gekkos successful deals they hang
like scalps from the walls Gekkos eyes drifting to Bud a
friendly easy smile for a flick of an instant he has
genuine charm in his manner and though ultrafast verbally
projects calm and confidence at the center A man who
obviously loves what he does to some small degree is
flashing his stuff for the outsider

GEKKO

(line 4)
Look Harold theyre vulnerable

Bahamas for me will ya We feint

BUD
(tries a smile awkward)
»got a connection at the airport

Gekko notes the answer wrapping the cuff of a state-of-the-
art automatic blood pressure monitor around his arm and
starts pumping it up His aides continue on the phones
GEKKO
So what s on your mind kimosabe
Why am I listening to you Got to
monitor my blood pressure so
whatever you do dont upset me

BUD
Oh no no

GEKKO
(demonstrating it)
Within 45 seconds a microprocessor
computes your systolic and
diastolic pressure Has an LCD
readout and its cost effective --
less than one visit to the doctor

BUD
I just want to let you know Mr
Gekko I read all about you at NYU
Business and I think youre an
incredible genius and Ive always

Bud opens his attache case and rifles out a handful of
briefs Gekko noting the blood pressure reading and taking
the cuff off his arm Ollie the big trader ambles back in

As he opens a birthday card and feeds it into the SHREDDER

that sits next to his desk over the waste basket The sound
it makes is soft and menacing Buddy knows its fourth down

and long Gekkos attention is shifting to the quotron In

frustration Bud blurts it out

BUD

Ollie comes back in as excited as he ever will get under
his rolls of flesh his voice deadpan

Hello again I been holding these

DARIEN

Excuse me
BUD

Grand Marnier A romantic and
tragic drink

DARIEN
Oh yes I remember you

BUD
Destiny took us apart but I knew

it would bring us back together

DARIEN
Aha Poet or philosopher

BUD
Stock broker As in never have so
few done so little for so much So
what do you see in this

Bud indicates the painting in front of them -- a buffalo
skull in the desert by Georgia OKeefe

DARIEN
Id give anything to have this in
my house even for a week

BUD
few thousand dollars down the
drain if you ask me

DARIEN

Oh really

(looks at him quizically)
Well I guess you can kiss that
career as an art appraiser goodbye
because we paid over four hundred
thousand for it at the contemporary
picture sale last June

BUD
(chokes)
You could have a great beach house
for that

DARIEN

Sure you could in Wildwood New
Jersey If you sold this

(indicates a Rothko

hanging near the OKeefe)
you could have a pretty nice
penthouse on Fifth But you
wouldnt have much left over for
decoration

BUD
Boy I thought Gordon was a tough
businessman but somebodys really
taking him to the cleaners here

DARIEN

Not really Id say that Gordon is
one of the most astute collectors
around He has a great eye and he
only buys the best Like this rug
for instance a silk Tabriz the
finest of its kind The day after
he bought it in London a dealer
representing the Saudi Royal Family
offered him twice what he paid It
absolutely makes the room See how
this little bit of celadon in the
border is picked up in the cushions
oh the sofa although

(shes really warming

up to her subject now)

I dont know if I would have used
that tea dipped linen for the
upholstery - too dingy

And its a sacrilege having that
Pre-Columbian pot in the center of
the coffee table Some dope might
use it as an ashtray

BUD
I gather youre a decorator

DARIEN
You got it a great spender of
other peoples money

BUD
Well if youre that good you
could probably do wonders at my place

DARIEN
Where is it

BUD
Upper West Side

DARIEN
(losing interest fast)
Oh really Home of the exposed
brick wall and the
(shudders)
houseplant

BUD

Oh its just a rental Im moving
to the East Side soon Ive got a
couple of deals brewing with Gordon

with his pretension)

of steel workers

A strong hint of the cockney working class east and London
boy whiffing through his speech and manner The mate is
tough and to the point but not insulting

You must be wearing a mask youre
laughing so hard behind it Larry
Lets cut the sir crap Correct
me if Im wrong but when you took
CNX Electronics you laid off 8000
workers Jessmon Fruit about 6000

WILDMAN
(cold deliberate)

I could break you mate in two
pieces over my knees you know it
I know it I could buy you six
times ever I could dump the stock
just to burn your ass but I happen
to want the company and I want your
block of shares Im announcing a
tender offer at 65 tomorrow and
Im expecting your commitment

Bud watching this drama unfold Gekko is about to blow
controls it

GEKKO

Showdowns bore me Larry neither
side wins You can have the
company in fact its gonna be fun
watching you and your giant ego try
to make a horserace out of it

(turns to Bud)
What do you think is a fair price
for our stock Bud

Bud in the spotlight The eyes all shift to him -- his
moment After an initial panic hes cool as a cucumber --
and ruthless as his mentor

BUD
The break up value is higher Its
worth 80

GEKKO

But we dont want to be greedy now
so lets let him have it at 72

His eyes to Wildman who looks at him cold icy mean

WILDMAN
Youre a two bit pirate and a
green-mailer Gekko nothing more

relaxation

HAROLD
»You understand Mr Gekko is

litigation and IRS audits
Buddy looks then up to Gekko who smiles casual

BUD
(nods)
Of course

HAROLD

So its in both our interests to
put a safe distance between you and
us

(passing a document

with a 2nd pen)
this gives you limited power of
attorney for Mr Gekkos account
Every trade you make is at your
discretion Every ticket you buy
must be marked power of attorney
That means you call the shots and
Mr Gekko has no official knowledge
of what stocks youre buying Sign

INT HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY

The annual Teldar Paper stockholders meeting is in session
400 stockholders are there -- many middle aged and older
one bag lady Cromwell sits on an elevated platform at the
front of the room surrounded by an army of bulky EXECUTIVES
none of them weighing less than 200 pounds ACCOUNTANTS and
LAWYERS Gekko in contrast seems like Robin Hood seated with
Alex Harold Bud and the other stockholders Cromwell is
delivering his prepared attack on Gekko in a highly
sarcastic gruff manner

CROMWELL
»Your company ladies and
gentlemen is under siege from
Gordon Gekko
Teldar Paper is now leveraged to
the hilt like some piss poor South
American countryinstead of using
our cash to build plants build our
business all this man really wants
is to get paid to withdraw his
tender offer and that will cost us
approximately another 200 million
in greenmail which will be passed
on to the consumer

Gekko seething jumps up

GEKKO
Where do you get off speaking about
me like that making remarks to the
press I resent these remarks I
demand the right to speak

CROMWELL
Sit down sir youre out of order
havent you done enough damage to
Teldar as it ishave you no
sense of decency

(to shareholders)
How can your management

Gekko is urged to sit down by his people but we hear various
catcalls Let the man speak Sit down Gekko

CROMWELL (CONTD)
»-concentrate on long term growth
when were busy fighting the get-
vich-quick short term profit slot
machine mentality of Wall Street
when we should be fighting Japan
The original fundamental reason for
Wall Street was to capitalize
American business underwrite new
business build companies build
America The deal has now
succeeded goods and services as
Americas gross national product
and in the process we are
undermining our foundation This
cancer is called greed Greed and
speculation have replaced long-term
investment Corporations are being
taken apart like erector sets
without any consideration of the
public good I strongly recommend
you to see through Mr Gekkos
shameless intention here to
strip this company and severely
penalize the stockholders I
strongly recommend you to reject
his tender by voting for
managements restructuring of the
stock

CUT TO

Gekko is now at floor level with a microphone Hes calmer
makes his pitch to the stockholders looking up at the
management

GEKKO

I appreciate the chance youre
giving me Mr Cromwell as the
single largest stockholder in
Teldar to speak

(gets some laughter

and applause loosens)
On the way here today I saw a
bumper sticker It said Life is a
bitch then you die

(gets another laugh)
well ladies and gentlemen were
not here to indulge in fantasies
but in political and economic
reality America has become a
second rate power Our trade
deficit and fiscal deficit are at
nightmare proportions In the days
of the free market when our
country was a top industrial power
there was accountability to the
shareholders The Carnegies the
Mellons the man who built this
industrial empire made sure of it
because it was their money at stake
Today management has no stake in
the company Altogether these guys
sitting up there own a total of
less than 3 and where does Mr
Cromwell put his million dollar
salary Certainly not in Teldar
stock he owns less than 1
You own Teldar Paper the
stockholders and you are being
royally screwed over by these
bureaucrats with their stea
lunches golf and hunting trips
corporate jets and golden
parachutes Teldar Paper has 33
different vice presidents each
earning over 200000 a year I
spent two months analyzing what
these guys did and I still cant
figure it out

(a big laugh)

Cromwell is pissed

CROMWELL
This is an outrage Gekko Youre
full of shit

GEKKO

One thing I do know is this paper
company lost 110 million last
year and Id bet half of that is
in the paperwork going back and
forth between all the vice
presidents

(increased laughter

hes getting them)
The new law of evolution in
corporate America seems to be
survival of the unfittest Well
in my book you either do it right
or you get eliminated Teldar Paper
is doomed to fail Its
diversification into casualty
insurance has not worked Its crown
jewels are its trees the rest is
dross Through wars depressions
inflations and deterioration of
paper money trees have always kept
their value but Teldar is chopping
them all down Forests are
perishable forest rights are as
important as human rights to this
planet and all the illusory
Maginot lines scorched earth
tactics proxy fights poison
pills etc that Mr

Cromwell is going to come up with
to prevent people like me from
buying Teldar Paper are doomed to
fail because the bottom line
ladies and gentlemen as you very
well know is the only way to stay
strong is to create value thats
why you buy stock to have it go up
If theres any other reason Ive
never hear it

(laughter)

ats all Im sayingits you
eople who own this company not
em they work for you and theyve
one a lousy job of it Get rid of
em fast before you all get sick
nd die I may be an opportunist
ut if these clowns did a better
ob Id be out of work In the

ast seven deals Ive been in

ere were 23 million stockholders
at actually made a pretax profit
of 12 billion When I bought the
Ixtlan Corporation it was in the
exact same position Teldar is

etetruoowdtaddyH

today -- I turned three of its
companies private and I sold four
others -- and each of these

companies liberated from the
suffering conglomerate has
prospered I am not a destroyer of
companies I am a liberator of them
The point is ladies and gentlemen
greed is good Greed works greed
is right Greed clarifies cuts
through and captures the essence
of the evolutionary spirit Greed
in all its forms greed for life
money love knowledge has marked
the upward surge of mankind -- and
greed mark my words -- will save
not only Teldar Paper but that
other malfunctioning corporation
called the USAThank you

Much applause as he sits Now a standing ovation shouts of
approval Cromwell knows he has lost the day tries to
continue the meeting by calling for order

Bud watches impressed

INTERIOR DECORATING MONTAGE

The music is geared to speed money triumph and just plain
material fun

INT BUDS CONDO - DAYNIGHT

In its first stage Darien supervising Its expanse of
white walls devoid of mouldings a blank plaster canvas The
city views are great the apartment identical to hundreds of
other cookie cutter condos Several young artists are
working on a neo-classical mural on the long side of the
living room They are colorfully dressed listening to a
TALKING HEADS tape while they work A carpenter who looks
like a member of Duran Duran is installing a pair of old
columns from Urban Archaeology on either side of the
entrance to the living room while another fits a brass sink
into an antique sideboard which has been turned into a bar

INT BUDS CONDO - DAYNIGHT
INTERIOR DECORATING MONTAGE - SECOND STAGE

Living room furniture arrives A fantail shrimp chaise from
Art Furnitures Sushi Collection arrives along with an
enormous sofa encased in an ecru linen slipcover made
deliberately baggy and tied on with rows of self bows on
each end several faux Etruscan pots wired up as lamps a
poured concrete coffee table that looks like it came from
Pompeii and a hand-painted floor cloth instead of a rug for
the bleached floor with the stencilled border Darien
sitting in a fantastical adirondack chair made from gnarled
branches amused by Buds reactions to the furniture

THIRD STAGE The kitchen has the latest compact computer
dishwasher and compact microwave garbage compactor and
sinks with infrared controls A brief food montage gives
us a sense of the modernist approach to food and its
preparation

1) Darien hones the knives on the electric knife sharpener as

2) Bud uses a stainless steel Cape Cod oyster opener to work
on two dozen oysters

3) at the same time working on the automatic vinaigrette
mixer the phone ringing to the tune of Mozarts Jupiter

BUD
(picking it up)
Yesnoat 37 12 Convert the
bonds rightand check the price
in Tokyo at 800 LA time Thanks

4) As he starts his pasta sauce flame an his OReilly fat-
free grill with a flexible neck fire starter

5) A freshly heated roll pops out of a hanging space-saving
toaster as Darien works the electric pasta maker while
melting the frozen ice cream cartons in the microwave

6) Bud manages to sneak a kiss an her lips humming the bars
from Verdis Rigoletto as he works the piece de la
resistance--the automatic sushi maker

7) Dinner is finally served on a demolished dinner table
Red wine pasta sushiit looks perfect lit by
candlelight the view of the city below

DARIEN
-isnt it perfect

BUD
too perfectlets not even eat
Lets just watch it and think about
it
(pause)

FOURTH STAGE - INT BUDS CONDO - DAY

Bud goes over a stack of bills with something approaching
concern as the gothic oak refectory table which seats 20 is
carried in followed by a Jean Michel Basquiat featuring a
skull on a rough board Darien instructs the movers to place
an important pair of satinwood Art Deco armchairs upholstered
in buttery suede (last Saturdays auction purchase for
20000) at either end of the titanic sofa No vestige is
left of the cookie cutter space we first saw Walls have
been removed mouldings and architectural found objects
added imitation rare woods marbles and frescos have been
created from nothing by the magic hands of the tromp loeil
crew The point is decorating can transform

INT CONDO - NIGHT

The look of the place is evocative of ancient times yet
sumptuous Darien and Bud sink into the bales of down in the
sofa and are dwarfed She rests her head on a hand stencilled
velvet Venetian throw pillow looking like a Pre-Raphaelite
madonna A terracotta pot with a spray of white phaleonopsis
graces the coffee table As the sun sets over the canyons of
highrises Bud walks around his new home totally in awe
This apartment perfect in its restrained taste with all the
correct flowers and objects has nothing to do with him
Perhaps he can understand the state-of-the-art kitchen the
computerized telephone stereo and light system but he
needs a set of instructions just to be able to switch on
David Letterman

This apartment is Dariens fantasy and Bud is merely the
incidental client who paid for it Most importantly to her
it is ready to be photographed by House and Garden

BUD

(dubiously looking at

a rough plaster wall

of fading fresco)
You know the elevator man couldnt
believe I paid 300000 to have my
walls looking like this hes got
them for free in Brooklyn

DARIEN

Ill bet hes got an opinion on the
stock market too This apartment is
already ahead of its time I call
it the demolished look Theyve
already heard about it at House and
Garden and theyre coming next week
to photograph it before it gets
lived in Is that alright Id love
to have it in my portfolio

BUD

youre way over budget should be

negotiable
As he nuzzles her neck she feels threatened stops

take me two years and 2000
headaches to turn Teldar Paper

airline for Im up to my ass in
more nuts than a fruitcake

BUD
Gordon I worked at Bluestar I

GEKKO
(getting the drift)
What does that mean

BUD

(playing out his ace)
The three unions Its 43 of
Bluestars operating budget the
hourly cost of a flight crew is
850 an hour thats the real
hidden value GG if you can
negotiate that out get a crew down
to 350-400 an hour a run this
airline is gonna be the hottest
thing since Texas Air

GEKKO
What makes you think you can

BUD
I can talk to these people Gordon
they trust meand my father can
be a big help in getting cuts

GEKKO
(pause)
Alright Susan get Buckingham on

INT BUDS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bud in high gear all smiles expensive Armani suit opens
the door His father stands before him looking like a man
on his way to the dentist

BUD
Dad well come on in Everybodys
here We couldnt start the show
without you

Wide-eyed Carl follows Bud through the foyer taking in the
furnishings paintings antiques

CARL
(under his breath)
Well Ill be a lousy Republican

DARIEN
(overhears him)
I decorate for Democrats too lots
of them
(she extends her hand
and gives him a warm smile)
Im Darien Taylor

CARL

(sardonically)
I know Youre one of the art works
that go with the apartment

(softens a little)
Pretty creative Doesnt look
anything like the place my son
bought a few months age

DARIEN
Listen I hope youll come here
often and under less formal
circumstances

Halfway won over Carl enters the living room where Darien
has set up a table with miniature gourmet pizza etc The
atmosphere is strained the camps separated Gekko stands by
the bar conferring with his lawyer Harold Salt Darien
walks over to the couch with drinks for the Ixtax Union
Reps DUNCAN WILMORE ALPA Leader a rugged silver-haired
uniformed pilot TONI CARPENTER AFA Rep hard looking
40ish flight attendant

BUD
Dad you know Duncan Wilmore
pilots union and Toni Carpenter
flight attendants

CARL
I met them before you were born

They exchange nods

BUD
And Id like to introduce you to Mr
Gekko and his lawyer Mr Salt

GEKKO
A pleasure to meet you Mr Fox

Carl stares at Gekko sizing him up

GEKKO
Id be proud to have a son like Bud
Hes got a great future ahead of him

Carl looks to his fellow union representatives then to Gekko

CARL
(gesturing at Salt)
I thought this was an informal
meeting Whats he doing here

GEKKO
(dismissing him)
Harold you dont mind strolling
around the block a couple hundred
times do you

HAROLD
(looks at his watch)
Of course

Salt gathers his jacket to leave as Gekko and Carl eye one
another tentatively

DARIEN
-please help yourselves to some
food

CUT TO
The food is half consumed Gekko addresses the union leaders
GEKKO
Look I have no illusions about

winning a popularity contest with
any of you I was roasted the other
night and a friend of mine asked--
why are we honoring this man--have
we run out of human beings

His joke breaks the ice they laugh except for Carl

GEKKO (CONTD)
Its not always the most popular
guy who gets the job done You got
losses of 20 to 30 million dollars
dividends cut to zero youre
getting squeezed to death by the
majors Present management may not
be the worst scum of the earth but
theyre the ones whove put you on
a kamikaze course and pretty soon
everybodys going to be scrambling
for the parachutes Only there
arent enough to go around
Management has them You dont If
they throw Bluestar into Chapter
11l--which I think they will--then
they can use bankruptcy laws to
break your unions and your
contracts and throw you guys off
the property

We hear a loud crunching sound as Buds father bites into a
roll glaring at Gekko

WILMORE
(pilot)
With all due respect Mr Gekko
whats to prevent you from doing
the same thing

GEKKO
Cause I have a way around all this
a way we can all make money and
make this airline profitable again
What do you say we cut to the chase
Im asking for a modest twenty
percent across-the-board wage cut

Carl drops his fork on the plate Gekko goes on

GEKKO
And seven more hours a month

Toni Carpenter and Duncan Wilmore exchange questionable looks
CARPENTER
What kind of time frame are we

talking about here

GEKKO
Give me a year If were still
losing money the reductions stand
If however we move into the black
I return part of the givebacks
salaries go back to present levels
and

(a beat)
we institute an employee profit
sharing program with stock Youll
own part of the airline

Carpenter and Wilmore react with surprise its obvious they
werent expecting the profit sharing part Bud smiles at
Darien and looks to his father who examines a sushi roll
before putting it back

WILMORE
Are you prepared to put that in
writing

GEKKO

Ill have a letter of agreement
drawn up within two days

CARPENTER
Whats your marketing strategy How
do you plan to return us to
profitability

GEKKO
Why dont I give Bud an opportunity
to answer that

Darien and Carl turn to Bud who puts down his wine glass

BUD
Thank you Mr Gekko First of all I
want you to know my door will
always be open to you cause I know
from my Dad its you guys that keep
Bluestar flying One -- Modernize
Our computer software is weak we
update it we squeeze every dollar
out of each seat and mile flown
You dont sell a seat to a guy for
89 when hes willing to pay 389
Effective inventory management
through computerization wil
increase our load factor by 5 to
20 that translates to
approximately 50 to 200 million
dollars in revenues the point is
we can beat the majors at a price
war Two -- Advertising -- more
more and aggressive attack the
majors Three -- expand our hubs to
Atlanta North Carolina and Dallas
reorganize all our feeder schedules

think Big -- guys were going
after the majors

The men are visibly shaken by Buds determination

GEKKO
(looking for reactions)
Cards are on the table What do you
think

WILMORE
(restrained hopeful)
If you mean what you say I think
were in the ball park Ill take
it to my people

CARPENTER
(approvingly)
Youve sketched some broad strokes
Id like to see the fine print But
so far so good

Gekko looks to Carl Fox who putting down knife and fork
breaks his silence

CARL
I guess if a man lives long enough
he gets to see everything And I
mean everything What else do you
have in your bag of tricks Mr Gekko

Bud tenses looking at his father Gekko ignores the
innuendo and replies softly

GEKKO
Frankly Carl I cant see giving
much more If you have any
suggestions Ill be glad to listen

CARL
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who
did not know

GEKKO
(smiling)
I beg your pardon Is that a proverb

CARL

(smiling)
No its a prophecy The rich have
been doing it to the poor since the
beginning of time The only
difference between the Pyramids and
the Empire State Building is that
the Egyptians didnt have unions

(looking at Wilmore

and Carpenter)
I know what this guy is about--
greed--hes in and out for the buck
and he dont take prisoners He
dont give a damn about Northstar
orus

BUD
Now wait a minute Dad

GEKKO
(shrugs keeping his composure)
Sure Whats worth doing is worth
doing for money Its a bad bargain
where nobody gains And if this
deal goes through we all gain

Carl throws down his napkin rises from the chair looks at
the others

CARL
(looks at Bud)
Course my son did work three
summers as a baggage handler and
freight loader With those
qualifications why should I doubt
his ability to run an airline

There is frozen silence at the table

GEKKO
Fine if you dont want us stay
with the scum in present
management--dedicated to running
you and Bluestar into the ground

CARL
»that scum built this company
up from one plane in thirty years
they made something out of nothing
and if thats a scum Ill take one
over a rat any day

Carl turns and leaves Bud glances at Gekko reading his
piercing look He hurries after his father

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Bud catches up to Carl waiting for the elevator hammering
him

BUD

job of embarrassing me in there--

INT ELEVATOR - NIGHT
Carl steps into the elevator Bud follows

CARL
Hes got your prick in his back
pocket son and youre standing
naked in the display window of
Macys Hes using you Only youre
too blind to see it

BUD
No what I see is a jealous old
machinist who cant stand that his
sons become more successful than
himself

CARL
What you see son is a man who
never measured success by the size
of a mans wallet

BUD
Thats because you never had the
guts to go out into the world and
stake your claim

CARL
(lamentably)
Boy if thats what you think I
mustve really screwed up my job as
a father

INT BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

Bud and Carl exit the elevator and head across the luxury

(pleading now)
Your responsibility Dad is to

CARL

He grabs Carl by the arm stopping him

BUD (CONTD)
Would you be willing to wreck your
mens future My future Please
Dad Think Be practical for a
change Im asking you Im fucking

Bud lets go of Carls arm Carl looks at his son seeing the
desperation Sadness and confusion take hold of him

CARL

INVESTMENT BANKER

(older man appeasing)
look we have 30 banks ready to
participate in a 4 year revolving
credit line but we have to have
your assurance to pay back most of
the loan in the first 6 months and
the only way

INVESTMENT BANKER
(intermittently interrupting)
30 banks isnt that
wonderfulyou got it no problem

COMMERCIAL BANKER
(insistent)
and the only way we can see this
happening is liquidating the
hangars and the planes Can you
people guarantee that

Bud freezes where he sitsit all comes crashing down in a
milli-second on that word liquidate -- shock now spreading
on Buds face

INVESTMENT BANKER
Guaranteed No sweatwe already
got the Bleezburg brothers lined up
to build condos where the hangars
are we can lay off the planes with
Mexicana who are dumb enough to
buy em and Texas Air is drooling
at my kneecaps to get the slots and
the routes Whats the problem
its done

ROGER
(passing a paper to
the commercial banker)
This is the pricetag on the 737s
the gates the hangars the routes
we got it all nailed right down to
the typewriters

Bud sits there numbly a sickening feeling taking hold of
him as the camera and music track and trap him tighter and
tighter The lawyers voices distorting in the background

INVESTMENT BANKER
course the beauty of it is the
overfunded pension fund Gekko gets
the 75 million in there Fifty
million buys him the minimum
annuities for 6000 employees and
he walks away with the rest All
in hell net 60 to 70 million Not
bad for a months work

GEKKO
(looks up)
I didnt know we had a meeting
schedule for this morning

BUD
Im sorry this cant wait

Gekko stares at him with piercing eyes

GEKKO
Will you gentlemen excuse us for a
few minutes

The lawyers and bankers get up and discreetly leave the room
Gekko waits for them to go turns back to Bud

GEKKO
What the hell do you want

BUD
I found out about the garage sale
down at Bluestar Why

Gekko is taken by surprise

GEKKO
Last night I read Rudy the story of
Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot
Know what happened he stuck his
nose in that honey pot once too
often and got stung

BUD
Maybe you ought to read him
Pinocchio You told me you were
going to turn Bluestar around Not
upside down You used me

GEKKO
Youre walking around blind without
a cane sport A fool and his money
are lucky to get together in the
first place

BUD
Why do you need to wreck this company

GEKKO
Because its wreckable I took
another look and I changed my mind

BUD
If these people lose their jobs
nowhere to go My father worked at
Bluestar for twenty-four years I
gave ‘em my word

GEKKO

(hard)
Its all about bucks kid the rest
is conversation

(loosening)
Bud youre still going to be
president And when the time comes
youll parachute out a rich man
With the money youre going to
make your father wont have to
work another day in his life

BUD
Tell me Gordon--when does it all
end How many yachts can you
waterski behind How much is enough

GEKKO
Buddy its not a question of
enough Its a zero sum game sport
Somebody wins and somebody loses
Money itself isnt lost or made
its simply transferred from one
perception to another Like magic
That painting cost 60000 10 years
ago I could sell it today for
600000 The illusion has become
real And the more real it becomes
the more desperately they want it
Capitalism at its finest

BUD
(again)
How much is enough Gordon

GEKKO

The richest one percent of this
country owns half the countrys
wealth 5 trillion dollars One
third of that comes from hard work
two thirds of it comes from
inheritance interest on interest
accumulation to widows and idiot
sons and what I do -- stock and
real estate speculation Its
bullshit Ninety percent of the
American people have little or no
net worth I create nothing I own
We make the rules Buddy the news
war peace famine upheaval the
cost of a paper clip

(picking one up)
We pull the rabbit out of the hat
while everybody else sits around
their whole life wondering how we
did it

»youre not naive enough to think
were living in a democracy are
you Buddy Its the free market
Youre one of us nowtake
advantage of it You got the killer
instinct kid stick with me I got
things to teach you

Youve worked hard to get where you

someone else will and whos to say
they wont do the same thing

BUD
At least I wouldnt be pulling the
trigger

She sighscomes over tries to shake some

DARIEN
Are you mad Why are you doing this
Were so close the town is going

future Bud

BUD

Im not looking to just survive

Ive been doing that all my life

Darien moves out from his approximate circle wrestling with
what she wants to sayuntil she turns and says it

DARIEN
That if you make an enemy of Gordon
Gekko I wont be there to stand by
you

Bud is stunnedand hurt

BUD

You really mean that

Youre not exactly pure Bud you
went after Gekko with the same
vengeance you went after me Look

She collects her things and walks to the door

DARIEN
Fair enoughbut its not that
simple Bud When I was down and
had nothing it was Gordon who
helped me He got me all my
clients -- you among them
(snaps her fingers)
and he can take it away like that

You may find out one day -- that

Sunshine

DARIEN
(indignantly)
Those days are over Gordon They
were over a long time ago

GEKKO
(condescendingly but
paying little
attention to the rebuff)
Cant blame me for trying You look
as beautiful as that painting I
just bought

He pats her on the back in a preprietary fashion

GEKKO (CONTD)
(mockingly)
So whats the problem Sunshine You
look like Black Thursday Bad case
of puppy love

DARIEN
(indignant)
Its not puppy love Gordon
Anyway Buddy and I are splitting up

GEKKO
(off handed)
Sorry to hear that I thought the
kid had staying power

DARIEN
Its over you Gordon

GEKKO
(cooly)

DARIEN
No are you crazy And I dont want
him ever to know Do you
understand

GEKKO
You and I are the same Darien
Were smart enough not to buy into
the oldest myth running love A
fiction created by people who got
nothing to keep them from jumping
out of windows

DARIEN
Youre really twisted Gordon
Youre incapable of giving to
anybody because deep down inside
you theres a poverty that every
last dollar in the world wont fill

GEKKO
Ooh ooh tough talk from a scared
little girl all wrapped in a pretty
grown-up package Does this mean
youre ready to cut the umbilical
cord and step out into the world on
your own Because Darien if
youre through with me youre
through with everything Im a part of

Dariens eyes cloud overthe look of a scared child being
banished by her father Then

Gordon Im good enough so I dont
need you anymore
