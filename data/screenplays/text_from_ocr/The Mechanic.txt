INT BISHOPS STUDY - NIGHT

CLOSE on the needle of a precision-weighted 33rpm turntable
It comes down touches vinyl The Rolling Stones Sympathy
for the Devil purrs out

ARTHUR BISHOP (40s) Sitting in a comfortable wooden chair
stares right through us Lean hard in perfect physical
shape In this moment carrying the stillness of someone
utterly in balance For all we know hes been sitting this
way for hours

BISHOP (V0O)

Every man has a death thats right

For every man theres a way to

leave this earth which is so right

for them its almost as if they

MOVING over the wall MORE PHOTOGRAPHS The Mark escorted
from a bullet-proof sedan by ear-wired men Entertaining at
a palatial estate Magazine covers The billion-dollar
lifestyle The new Playboy passing over smaller
articles What does this man do with your money
working

BISHOP (VO) (CONTD)

When the right death overtakes a

man there will be grief in those

who knew him but there will also

be a sense of inevitability

Because they will know that of

course

CLOSE ON BISHOP Statue-like except his eyes which dart
across the wall in front of him making connections

EXT RURAL RACETRACK - DAY

VINTAGE RACE CARS speed by a blur of color But all we hear
is the Rolling Stones song And

BISHOP (V0O)

Of course this was always going

to happen this way

WHOMP The SOUND OF THE RACE floods in as the cars blow by
revealing Bishop amidst onlookers watching calculating

BISHOPS POV Two cars TANGLE in a corner SPIN to a
stop crushing a half-million in beautiful restored antique
The Mark climbs from his wreck tosses his helmet pissed
Bishop raises a camera takes a picture

INT RIVERWAY - NIGHT

Bishop stands in front of a moving riverway his body
sheathed in a black slicksuit backpack on He slips into
the water and starts to SWIM

We STAY with Bishop as he SWIMS HARD powerfully not

Finally we PULL AWAY across miles of water realizing this
is what Bishop will swim without stopping

EXT ISLAND SHORE - NIGHT

A pair of ARMED SECURITY patrol a wooded shore One lifts a
pair of binoculars scans the shore as BEHIND THEM a form
moves from behind a tree blends into the woods

ON BISHOP Moving fast silent towards a LIT STRUCTURE in
the distance

INT HIDEAWAY - NIGHT

BLACK The SENSE that someone is in here with us

A LOW GREEN GLOW illuminates Bishop in a TINY CRAMPED
COMPARTMENT No way to know what or where The glow coming
from his watch illuminates his face crammed and
claustrophobic An eye checks the time the light goes out
follow

he

Just the sound of his breathing
EXT SPORTS CLUB WOODS - MORNING

CRACK CRACK PLUMES OF SMOKE rise from the end of vintage
hunting rifles Game birds scatter into the air Dogs BARK
tear through underbrush MEN dressed in traditional hunting
livery move through foggy woods followed by STEWARDS

This is old school hunting old school weapons Camera finds
The Mark raising his weapon sights BLAM A PHEASANT
falls dogs race after it The Mark starts forward but is
interrupted by his Steward reminding him to break his weapon
as the other hunters have

The Mark pushes the man back ignoring him hurrying on At
a small distance two unhappy private security guards

INT HIDEAWAY - NO TIME

BLACKNESS A soft BEEPING almost inaudible A low rustle
of cloth then the green glow illuminates Bishops face as

checks the time again Hasnt moved in HOURS
EXT SPORTS CLUB WOODS - MORNING

The Mark stumbles forward over-eager to get to his prize
Hes worked his way ahead of the field The MIST has grown
thicker Human forms move on all sides hard to distinguish
CRACK CRACK Guns go off around them Dogs rush by The
Mark brings the weapon to his face BLAM The shot echoes
through the foggy woods

INT SPORTING CLUB - DAY

The Mark pleased with himself as always bursts into the
lodge gun over his shoulder A round of APPLAUSE as his

Steward holds up the mornings catch

He pushes on into the locker rooms as one security takes

station at the door The second emerges from the lockers
having just done his sweep
hands

fast

INT LOCKER ROOM SPORTING CLUB - DAY

The Mark leans his vintage hunting rifle against the wall
opens his locker He kicks off his boots pulls off his
shirt Takes a second to rub his face with his hands It
can be exhausting being him

Behind the Mark a locker door opens and closes Like a
ghost did it He doesnt sense a thing reaches for his
weapon accidentally knocks it to the side It LANDS HARD
The Mark WINCES half expecting it to fire But no

He starts to lean down for it when another mans gloved

reach it first The Mark smiles down at the well-dressed man
crouched by the gun a little confused

Bishop looks up smiles back He puts out a gloved hand
Before the Mark can consider hes taken Bishops hand
Bishop holds tight The Marks smile fades

Even though we know its coming Bishops actions are so

and final were taken by surprise He PULLS the Mark in as
at the same time he cocks the rifles hammer slams the gun
into position barrel pointed up and BOOM

The shot hits the Mark in the face obliterates him sends a
plume of gore up against the ceiling

One two seconds before the Marks SECURITY rush into the
room guns lined First sees the mess puts a hand to his
mouth Second starts on the radio

The room is empty

young woman with him LOUISE Shes a trophy the woman you
get for being top dog and the one you regret getting
Gorgeous self-obsessed entitled She flops onto a leather
sofa as Steve moves towards the office

Steves young mid-20s strikingly handsome wearing the
casual uniform of wealth not earned But theres something
else that arrests Bishop immediately Unwasted motion
detachment observing the world around him from above

Even as Steve nods to one of his fathers security and

into the room he picks up Bishop The two men lock eyes a
strange reflection not of appearance but of nature

MCKENNA (CONTD)
And heres the prodigal son

towards the pool Doesnt hear anything He sits back in
his chair

UNDERWATER The struggle is violent silent terrible in
its inevitable conclusion The Mark writhes and jerks but
Bishop holds her tight always pulling her away from the
surface Finally the fight goes out of her She goes limp
in his arms

He turns her stares into her unseeing eyes Then lets her
go rising slowly to the surface

EXT BISHOPS HOME - DAY
the

The door to the car gives suddenly falls to the ground The
Detective pulls a handkerchief puts it over his nose and
mouth as he peers in at the body

INT MCKENNAS OFFICE - DAY

Steve busts in dragging his fathers 80s turntable with
him The portrait of Bishop has been hung here in his
office He glances at it then breaks the seal on the
Hendrix album stares at the grooves before seating it on

turntable and hitting a switch Player starts up needle
swings over

Steve moves to his computer and punches in the password

On the wall-sized screen the Bishop research glows to life
All the connections people history that made Bishop
Bishops cat jumps into his lap purring and Steve strokes
her Finally a decision He hits a button and the prompt
DELETE FILE Appears on the screen

Needle comes down touches the record the sweet sound of
Hendrixs Little Wing fill the world

Steves finger still hovers over ENTER Bishops cat jumps
down trots away He watches the cat go hits the button
The wall-sized screen goes blank Just a cool white nothing
Steve SMILES nods leaning back when a voice comes from
the record player overlayed above the song

BISHOPS VOICE
Steve if you hear this then it
means you found the right moment to
play the record Good for you It
also means you had to scratch the
needle across the surface of the
record
Steves eyes LOCK on the record player the needle

scratching

across its surface from the surface of the record the
smallest trace of smoke

BISHOPS VOICE (CONTD)
Sorry it has to end this way
Steves eyes dart to the portrait of Bishop Its cold eyes
stare back

EXT MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

KABOOOM The windows of Steves office blow out of the
estates 2nd story

FADE TO
EXT BISHOPS HOME - DAY

The Detective handkerchief over his face leans over the
body Burnt beyond recognition CAMERA moves away down to
the bodys shoulder

BISHOP (V0O)
Every man has a death thats right
for them Every one

where a form a heat shadow has burnt into the charred
remains of a shirt A fist middle-finger raised We know
this tattoo It was on the ex-con who tried to mug Bishop
outside the bar This is not Bishop

BISHOP (VO) (CONTD)

A death so right that when it
arrives those who knew him will
say Yes this is right

The detective leans the body forward and the shadow
disintegrates into ash

EXT DESERT ROAD - DAY

A brand new Maserati crests the hill moving FAST Brakes
lock up it slides to a stop in a patch of dirt

BISHOP (V0O)

This was always going to happen

this way

Bishop gets out Shaved healthy clean He climbs onto the
roof of the car stares at the highway which winds away into
the distance
Freedom laid out before him He stares at it wanting
needing He blinks

FADE TO BLACK

THE END
