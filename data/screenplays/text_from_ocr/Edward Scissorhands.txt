INVENTOR
Is it good form to accept a second cup Now
should the napkin be entirely unfolded Oh
should the center crease Be allowed to remain

blunders But etiquette humiliation and
discomfort Mmm yes boring Let us switch to
Um To some poetry Hmm There was an old
man from the cape Who made himself there

Nothing to worry about With your talent and
reputation its going to be a snap Now

BANK CLERK

security number You may as well not even
exist There is no collateral

PEG
You know We already have a second on the
house but dont the testimonials make a
difference Did you see here the mayors wife

social security card Establish credit and buy
yourself a car You have the side to advantage

outrage Dont you worry This isnt the end of

OFFICER ALLEN
Will he be okay Doc

PSYCHOLOGIST
The years in spent isolation have not equipped
him with the tools necessary to judge right
from wrong Hes had no context Hes been
completely without guidance Furthermore his
work the garden sculptures hair styles and
so forth Indicate that hes a highly
imaginative

OFFICER ALLEN
Character

PSYCHOLOGIST
It seems clear that his awareness of what we
call reality is radically underdeveloped
