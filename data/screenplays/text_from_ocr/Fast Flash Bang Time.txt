FADE IN
EXT CITY STREET - NIGHT

Filthy puddle Reflection of a man appears edge of frame
MO HARDY 35 cropped hair a bit ragged in a dark suit

On his face Needs a shave Short depth of focus because
Hardy is caught in a fog that is his life He stands waiting
Finishes a smoke Sparks another Shots are tight slightly
wide angle gently distorted the camera low somewhat
dutched suggesting all that is not right with this man

Isolation shame discomfort fear double-life trapped
and insanity are words that describe Mo Hardy

A polished BLACK LIMO pulls up Tinted rear window rolls
down Alone in the back sits GERALD CHAMALES 50’s Mob Boss
Gestures Hardy to get in

INT CHAMALES LIMO PARKED CITY STREET - NIGHT

Up front ride two bodyguards TALL and SHORT Tall looks around
at Hardy They know each other Short keeps his eyes always
on the street Professional Hardy looks at Chamales

HARDY
I took care of the thing It’s done

CHAMALES
So I heard How you got to that
Judge I’1ll never know

HARDY
How is she

CHAMALES
Coming around I took care of that
punk who got her started
Hardy doesn’t want to know
CHAMALES (CONT’D) (cont’d)
I love my daughter What do you expect
me to do

Hardy nods opens the door to get out

TALL BODYGUARD
You dropped something

Out of his hand falls a ROLL OF 100 BILLS in a rubber band

A lousy 200 bucks Tosses back the rest of it

HARDY
You owe me one

Hardy gets out Walks toward a parked MUSTANG

EXTINT SEEDY BOULEVARD MUSTANG - NIGHT

Cheap motels Neon washing over a windshield MO HARDY
drives his beefy MUSTANG frustrated twitchy poking at
the keypad on his CELLPHONE He gets the BEEPING of a pager

Over the car RADIO comes a news item “Four people found
murdered in their home Police have made no arrests nor
identified any suspects at this time”
But Mo Hardy only wants his phone to ring

both ends with a dried small flower inside

HARDY

And this

The clerk produces a Chore Boy BRILLO PAD

MINI-MART CLERK

The SIRENS are closing in

Hardy drops awkwardly into the narrow space behind the motel
and the FENCE that separates it from the alley He stumbles
over JUNK trying to squeeze past it frantically trying to
get away A FLASHLIGHT beam washes over him as COPS lean out
the bathroom window coming after him

The cops climb out to give chase Hand-held camera follows
Hardy struggling to climb up and over the fence--

--only to FALL face-first to the asphalt on the other side
Scraped up he gets to his feet and starts running

The OFFICERS hop the fence and pursue him

We follow Hardy running He is crazy with drugs fear and
adrenaline -- MOTION SENSOR LIGHTS tripping as he bolts past
Hardy turns a corner and runs down another alley

We swish-pan back to officers giving chase HEADLIGHTS fast
approaching blinding us the officers stepping aside as

Sitting in the filth

Mo takes out a CRACK PIPE from his coat pocket One end of
the glass has busted He pushes the brillo with a bent PAPER
CLIP From one end of the glass tube to the other back and
forth cutting his fingers on the jagged edge bleeding on
the glass until the brillo is thick with gooey resin

Puts the pipe in his mouth He sparks his cheap LIGHTER
He struggles suddenly overwhelmed with emotion

Mo Hardy smashes the pipe under his fist He starts crying
Beyond despair Full of self loathing Utterly pathetic
Tormented over what he’s become

The bartender frowns walks away Camera follows him
focusing on a very sexy lady MARILYN PESNER She sits alone
across the bar Tight blouse skirt nylons high heels
Even the way she sips a GREEN APPLE MARTINI is sexy

Marilyn is no hooker Though she appears available the

confidence she exudes might intimidate most men There is
something detached damaged about her Although she looks
untroubled she doesn’t seem to be having much fun either

Mo Hardy regards her She is clearly out of his league
tonight considering the condition he’s in But to his
surprise she turns to meet his gaze Maybe he does have
a chance Her eyes are an invitation Bedroom eyes

Before making his move Hardy leans to the BLUE-HAIRED OLD
LADY next to him smoking a CIGARETTE

Got another choke

BLUE-HAIRED OLD LADY
Excuse me

Hardy helps himself to her pack of Marlboros Lights one

INT SEXAHOLICS ANONYMOUS MEETING - DAY
Tight on Marilyn remembering

PESNER

I was afraid not to do as he said
And he hadn’t broken any laws yet
so my squad -- outside listening --
they couldn’t bust in yet Soon this
guy had his hands all over me and
something happened I mean I’d never
felt like that before I was overcome
I went wild I’d never given head
before When the agents finally did
barge in I told them he’d forced me

(a beat)
I suddenly got what all this fuss
was about Sex I mean And ever
since I can’t seem to get it right

The group seems to understand exactly what she is saying

PESNER (CONTD) (contd)
A year later my husband’s left me
I’m fired for having an affair with
my boss

looking for it Picking up guys
Married men I don’t care

Marilyn pauses sadly

be with somebody really be with
