NEW REGENCY
FADE IN

EXT OPEN DESERT - AFGHANISTAN - DAY
SUPER Afghanistan

A young AFGHAN BOY stands in the desert tending a flock of
four mangy goats A low RUMBLE sounds from behind him The
boy turns just in time to have a huge B-52H soar low over his
head with a tremendous ROAR

The boy turns and watches it fly off into the desert -- a big
smile on his face

INT B-52H (AIRBORNE) - BOMBER HOLD - DAY

It’s just as loud inside the aircraft as out The bomber is
loaded with 30 bunker-busting JDAM WARHEADS perched over bomb
bay doors The weapons rattle and shake with the four
screaming engines that power this monster bird

INT B-52H - UPPER FLIGHT DECK - DAY

PILOT CO-PILOT and EWO (Electronic Warfare Officer) ride
the upper flight deck the long expanse of endless Afghan
landscape laid out like a great blanket before them

The pilot shakes his head

PILOT
This isn’t the right mountain
range We’re off course

CO-PILOT
How can you tell This whole god-
forsaken country looks the same
Endless nothing

PILOT
Spend enough time here and you
start to feel it
(into headset)
Caldwell you sure of this heading

INT B-52H - LOWER FLIGHT DECK - DAY

The NAVIGATOR is scrambling in front of screens that flicker
in front of his eyes
NAVIGATOR
I thought I was sir but I’m
getting electric interference I
can’t get a read on anything at the
moment

PILOT (0S)
(from headset)
Electrical Where’s it coming
from

NAVIGATOR
I don’t know It’slet me try
and sort it out sir Stand by

The RADAR NAVIGATORBOMBARDIER who sits at a station across
from the navigator kicks his feet up and folds his arms
resting

BOMBARDIER
Wake me when we find something to
bomb

The navigator touches his screen and receives a nasty shock
He jerks his hand back rubbing it staring at the static-
filled screen baffled
NAVIGATOR

What’s going on
EXT B-52H - AIRBORNE - DAY
The plane powers toward a jagged mountain range in the
distance

INT B-52H - UPPER FLIGHT DECK - DAY

The co-pilot’s altimeter suddenly drops dead the arrow
pointing to the ground

CO-PILOT
What the hell

PILOT
What is it

CO-PILOT
Altimeter just failed

The pilot reaches over and taps the dial -- and it springs
back to life He cocks a wry smile
PILOT
Magic touch These old birds are
full of ticks

Suddenly every dial on the control panel FAILS every light
goes dim and a great moan of electrical failure shutters
through the entire ship

The pilots exchange looks The co-pilot tips his head toward
the panel and says with a touch of panic

CO-PILOT
Tap it

The pilot turns back to his dead panel -- what the heck he
taps Nothing From his headset crackles the voice of the
panicked navigator

NAVIGATOR (0S)
(from headset)
Sir I’ve lost all my screens

PILOT
So have we Electrical failure
I’m going to initiate an emergency
restart

EXT B-52H - AIRBORNE - DAY

The hot sun glints off the huge plane as it banks toward a
ragged valley in the near distance

INT B-52H - UPPER FLIGHT DECK - DAY

The co-pilot watches his wheel turning by itself in front of
his eyes

CO-PILOT
We’re banking

PILOT
Banking How

The co-pilot shoots him a look

CO-PILOT
I don’t know

The pilot fights his own turning wheel as he snaps switches
on and off in the hopes that he can regain control
PILOT
We’re caught in some sort of freak
weather vortex I’m going to shut
down number four engine and see if
I can pull her--

A red warning light suddenly screams in their faces The EWO
spins

EWO
Ordnance release activated

CO-PILOT
What
INT B-52H - LOWER FLIGHT DECK - SAME
The bombardier spins from his own screaming station

BOMBARDIER
What the hell did you do

NAVIGATOR
Nothing

The pilot’s voice calls urgently from the headset
PILOT (0S)
Thompson what’s going on down
there
The bombardier is throwing switches on his board to no avail
BOMBARDIER
It’s not me It’s activating
itself
A blast of light and screaming wind suddenly fill the plane
behind him Both he and the bombardier turn their stunned
faces filled with light
INT B-52H - UPPER FLIGHT DECK - DAY

The pilot struggles with the wheel as the plane reacts to
what’s happening below

PILOT
What’s happening now
INT B-52H - LOWER FLIGHT DECK - SAME

Papers are blowing everywhere vest buckles are flapping
wildly the navigator calls back

NAVIGATOR

The bomb bay doors have opened
She’s going to release

INT B-52H - UPPER FLIGHT DECK - DAY
The men in the cockpit can’t believe what’s happening

CO-PILOT
This is impossible

PILOT
(into headset)

Thompson do whatever you can to
secure that payload

INT B-52H - LOWER FLIGHT DECK - SAME

The bombardier unbuckles himself and dashes toward the rear
of the plane into the screaming wind

BOMBARDIER
I’m going to manually disengage the
power to the release mechanism

The navigator crosses himself

EXT B-52H - AIRBORNE - DAY

The huge plane levels toward a jagged caynon like a deep
scar in the Afghan earth

INT B-52H - UPPER FLIGHT DECK - DAY
The wheel begins to turn back

CO-PILOT
She’s leveling out sir

EWO
It’s like we’re coming in for a
bombing run

PILOT
What’s below us
The co-pilot looks down out his window Then back
CO-PILOT
Mountains sir Just mountains
EXT B-52H - AIRBORNE - DAY

The huge plane screams low over our heads

INT B-52H - BOMB BAY - DAY

The bombardier hits the lip of the open doors the bombs
hanging over jagged mountains and scorched earth The
mechanism he needs is on the other side of the door He
takes a deep breath then DASHES ACROSS THE TOPS OF THE
BOMBS leaping safely to the other side

He throws the lever and

INT B-52H - UPPER FLIGHT DECK - DAY

The alerts fall quiet The electronic release aborted The
pilot breathes a sigh of relief

PILOT
Nice work Thompson
INT B-52H - BOMB BAY - DAY

The bombardier hops back across the tops of the bombs
crossing back over the open abyss

Behind him the switch suddenly throws back into active
position

Red lights blaze Warning alerts scream

And the payload releases

EXT B-52H - AIRBORNE - DAY

The B-52 drops the screaming bombardier and a carpet of
warheads down on top of a jagged mountain range at the far
end of the scarlike valley The bombs punch into the
mountains causing huge fiery explosions to erupt from
within
INT B-52H - UPPER FLIGHT DECK - DAY

The EWO looks to the pilots with a swallow

EWO
Bombs are away

CO-PILOT
Jesus

PILOT

It’s okay There was nothing down
there to hit

At that moment the plane’s steering column leaps forward
violently nosing the plane down Engines scream fail and
pop with flame and fiery oil It’s as if the huge plane were
being yanked from the sky by a huge unseen hand

The men try to fight the wheel back G-forces pinning them in
their seats the pressure pulls all the scream from their
throats as the ground rushes up before their eyes

EXT B-52H - DESERT VALLEY - DAY

The huge plane noses up at the last minute and comes in for a
spectacular CRASH LANDING It digs through the earth
shattering one wing and shedding engines It roars directly
for us as we

SMASH CUT TO

BLACK SCREEN
And a phantom whisper

WHISPER

FADE UP ON

EXT DESERT AIRFIELD - AFGHANISTAN - DAY - ESTABLISHING
SUPER Operation Enduring Freedom

US troops equipment and heavy ordnance are stretched
across the desert A-10s Apaches Chinooks F-18s and B-

52Hs sit ready to pound the distant snowcapped mountains

ANOTHER SUPER Year seven
VARIOUS SHOTS of men going about the drudgery of daily
routine -- taking baths in the open spaces shaving reading
gambling staring blankly at nothing A wall-of-shame
bulletin board is filled with snapshots of unfaithful wives
and girlfriends Soldiers and Afghan civilians fill trays of
food at a chow line eating at segregated tables beneath a
weathered American flag

Through the dusty controlled chaos we see a TRANSPORT pull
up and stop JAKE GALLOWAY late 20s leaps off amid a dozen
new recruits He’s dressed in a shirt and tie and looks more
than a little lost

He stops an Afghan aide worker They converse in Afghan --
the man points across the compound Galloway thanks him and
moves purposely toward a community of tents

He nears a small tent where ROY TELLER 22 -- from Detroit
Special Ops demolitions and a bit of a bully -- sits with an
M-16 in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other Galloway
nods in greeting but as he moves for the entrance Teller
drops his gun into his path

TELLER
Where’re you going friend

GALLOWAY
I’m here to see Major Gans

TELLER
The major’s in conference

That’s when we hear a man VOMITING from beyond the doorway
Teller cranes his head toward the door

TELLER (CONTD)
You okay Maj

GANS (0S)
(from inside)
Fuck you
TELLER

We threw him a little farewell
party last night Got the booze
from a local supplier Major got a
bad bottle Happens

GALLOWAY
Farewell party

TELLER
The major’s going home

VANCE KANE 29 career soldier from San Diego steps up to
the door rapping on the crossbeam

KANE
Colonel wants to see you Major
Says immediately

Gans grunts an affirmative Kane turns to Galloway looks
him up and down

KANE (CONTD)
Who’s this

TELLER
He’s nobody

Galloway’s mouth opens to speak but Kane is already gone
He turns back to Teller

GALLOWAY
Do you know who the new C0O is
I’m supposed to ride with this
unit

TELLER
All I know is what they tell me
That means I don’t know shit

That’s when the door swings open and MAJOR FRANK GANS
appears He’s in his late 30s his face is sunburnt from
long days in the desert his hair is cropped close He hands
Teller a puke-filled helmet

GANS
Thanks for the helmet

TELLER
Ahman

Gans snatches Teller’s coffee and walks quickly across the
compound He swigs the coffee swishes and spits tosses
the metal cup aside

Teller hands the helmet off to fellow soldier SILO 19 a
dim farm boy from Kansas who sports a T-shirt that reads
“Sith Happens”

TELLER (CONT’D)
Clean that

Galloway follows Gans trying to match his step dodging a
football that sails past his head

GALLOWAY
Major Gans My name’s Galloway
Jake Galloway I’ve been assigned
to your unit

GANS
I didn’t ask for anyone

GALLOWAY
I’m with the State Department I’m
a regional warfare analyst

Gans stops and turns squinting against the bright sunshine

GANS
A what

GALLOWAY
An expert on the history of warfare
in Afghanistan I’m here to refine
an assessment study The secretary
feels the best way for me to do
that is to join a unit

GANS
How long you been on the ground

GALLOWAY
I just arrived

GANS
Then you’re no expert

He turns and starts to walk again Galloway catching up

GALLOWAY
Well let’s say specialist I
wrote a report in 2002 about the
historic difficulties faced by
armies who have fought in the
region I admit it didn’t get much
attention at the time but there’s
new interest in my conclusion that
there is an X factor at play

GANS
A what

GALLOWAY
An X factor An unknown Buta
specific and tangible unknown A
reason each army has failed

GANS

There is no X factor Armies fail
only when they surrender The man
you want to talk to is Scott
Preacher You’re his headache not
mine

(opening door)
You can’t come in here

Gans marches through the door marked Command and Control
letting it close hard on Galloway

INT DESERT AIRFIELD - COMMAND AND CONTROL BUNKER - DAY

COLONEL FOX 50s ROTC wet dream sits at a folding desk
Also in the room is a man in a suit SADDLER CIA In stark
contrast to the soldiers these men looked scrubbed and
clean as if the war had just begun

Gans steps into the room with a salute

GANS
Colonel

He looks at Saddler offers a nod It’s not returned Fox
opens a dossier and speaks without looking up at Gans

COLONEL FOX
I understand youve received your
papers Major

GANS
Yes sir I’m going home

COLONEL FOX
Were delaying those orders

GANS
What

Fox looks up at him for the first time

COLONEL FOX
We have a mission for you

Gans can’t believe what he’s hearing

GANS
With all due respect Colonel I’ve
been in this place for six
deployments I earned my ticket
home a dozen missions ago -- you’ve
said that yourself

(MORE )

GANS (CONTD)
If you’ve got a mission give it to
Preacher I’m done

COLONEL FOX
Scott Preacher was killed in an
ambush in Tora Bora It will take
three weeks to requisition a new
officer from Iraq and this can’t
wait I’m sorry Frank You’re on
deck

Gans gives a slow nod sobered by the news of his
replacement’s death

GANS
I’m sorry to hear about Scott He
was a good man What’s the
mission

COLONEL FOX
SAR We lost a fully loaded B-
52 We’d rather it not be sitting
out in the middle of the desert
like a big Christmas present for
the Talibanor worse Find the
plane rescue any survivors
destroy the unexploded ordnance

GANS
Straightforward enough Whered
she go down

COLONEL FOX
That’s where it gets a little less
straightforward This is Agent
Saddler from CIA He’1l explain

He nods to Saddler who steps forward He clicks on a slide
projector a map image comes up reflecting full against
Gans’s face

CIA SADDLER
The Hindu Kush Mountain range
Uncharted treacherous -- locals
consider it something of an Afghan
Bermuda Triangle won’t go near it
Even the Russians won’t share intel
on the region even though we know
they fought there during the war
An automated beacon tells us she
went down dead center in this
range We can only assume they
were off course

(MORE )
Gans nods

Gans nods

CIA SADDLER (CONTD)
How the hell they got that far off
course is anybody’s guess

GANS
Do we have air reconnaissance of
the crash site

CIA SADDLER
We did a sweep of the area with
both satellite and drone Photos
came back blank

GANS
Blank As in no crash

CIA SADDLER
As in no picture Photos were
black All of them Completely
black Tried a half dozen times
and every time we got the same
result

COLONEL FOX
That’s not information that’s to be
shared Major

CIA SADDLER
Satellite reconnaissance isn’t
cheap and the DOD isn’t crazy
about spending more time and money
when a team on the ground can get
the job done just as well

COLONEL FOX
You’1l rendezvous with a unit of
Indian Marcos They have a nose
for the region and will act as
guides

GANS
Guides Is that necessary

CIA SADDLER
I’m afraid so The region is
politically sensitive It’s ruled
by warlords and technically part
of the UN’s watch But make no
mistake It’s our bird This is a
US mission

COLONEL FOX
You leave in an hour Get your men
ready Good luck

Gans salutes turns to go then

CIA SADDLER
Um Major

Gans turns to see Saddler waiting expectantly Gans swallows
some bile then fires off a hard salute

Saddler grins and nods

EXT DESERT AIRFIELD - COMMAND AND CONTROL - DAY
Galloway is waiting by the door as Gans exits his jaw tight

GANS
Looks like you’re riding with me
for at least one mission

GALLOWAY
Yes sir

He looks at Galloway critically

GANS
They give you any combat training

GALLOWAY
I’ve been through Basic I
insisted on that Technically I
hold the rank of private

GANS
Bet you did just swell on your
written test

GALLOWAY
I did in fact

GANS
Listen Galloway I need all my men
on the same page so here’s the
reality We came and we kicked the
ass of the Taliban and did a hell
of a job But instead of going
home we’re still over here
swimming in shit The enemy can be
anyone at anytime and the only
thing they want to do is kill
Americans

(MORE )

GANS (CONTD)
So our primary job as soldiers and
men with families back home is to
stay alive That’s it We’re not
saving the world Not anymore
Stay alive and get home with all
your body parts intact That’s the
mission

He thumps Galloway in the chest with what we see is the stump
of a missing finger

GANS (CONT’D)
Understand

Galloway nods

GANS (CONT’D)
Chopper pad one hour Make sure
your canteen is full Gets hot as
hell out there

EXT HINDU KUSH CANYON - DAY

Wide Empty Hot as hell A GOAT separated from the
flock wanders in the middle of the dry land foraging for
food nibbling at a few dry sticks that sprout from the hard-
packed sand

The goat looks up suddenly alerted ears perked It stares
into the distant Hindu Kush Mountains where we now hear what
it hearsthe SCREAMS of a man

CLOSE

A sharp KNIFE is brought down onto stone carving a word in
the rock as a man SCREAMS in agony OS

BACK ON THE GOAT

Who loses interest as the screaming suddenly falls silent
The animal takes another step dry tongue licking at dust

Suddenly the goat VANISHES into the earth with a STARTLED
CRY Move forward to reveal that the animal has fallen into
a HOLE in the desert floor From deep inside the darkness
we hear the SNARL of something savage and the sound of the
goat being torn to shreds

EXT DESERT AIRFIELD - RUNWAY - DAY

The props of a BLACK HAWK HELICOPTER whine to life sounding
eerily similar to the dying goat It spits oil and comes on
full throttle thwacking at the hot air

Gans boards the chopper with his SIX-MAN TEAM now including
Galloway in a crisp clean uniform reflecting his rank

INT BLACK HAWK - AIRSTRIP RUNWAY - DAY

The soldiers belt in along the sides of the chopper passenger

hold The noise is deafening Galloway belts in beside the
open door Teller taps him hard on the shoulder

TELLER
That’s my seat fresh meat
GALLOWAY
What
TELLER
My seat That’s my seat I need
that seat
MOSES FRANKLIN 26 -- African-American a likable guy from
Baton Rouge -- shakes his head
FRANKLIN

Sit your ass down Teller Ain’t
no seat better than the next

TELLER

I need it

GALLOWAY
It’s fine No problem

Galloway unbelts and moves over a seat Teller plops down
and spits a load of chewing tobacco out the door (that’s why

he needed the seat) He extends the bag to Galloway
TELLER
Chew
GALLOWAY

(shakes head)
I had a bag for lunch

Sitting across from Galloway and Teller is Kane who frowns

KANE
You need to kick that weed Teller

TELLER
It ain’t killin’ no one

He spits toward the door and hits the frame dripping brown
goo

FRANKLIN
No one likes livin’ in a world of
secondhand spit

TELLER
Liberal
HERNANDEZ 22 -- Hispanic from San Antonio on the short
side but makes up for it by being one tough SOB -- leans
forward with a grin
HERNANDEZ

Better hold onto your asses gents
This pilothe’s fuckin’ nuts

On the PILOT wearing a feathered cowboy hat looking fuckin’
nuts He looks at Gans

PILOT
Thought they were shipping you
home Frank

Beside him Gans traces a map with the stump of his missing
finger into a region largely unmarked He looks up through
the dusty windshield

GANS
Now why would they do that when I
still got nine good fingers left

EXT BLACK HAWK - AIRBORNE - DAY

The chopper BLASTS across frame flying unusually low A
GUNNER sits with SAW ready to return any ground fire

A SERIES OF HIGH-ENERGY SHOTS alternate between the scenic
and the horrific the rumble of a flattened village a man
collecting water from a dirty stream charred bodies of
Taliban soldiers in the back of a burnt-out pickup truck

INT BLACK HAWK - AIRBORNE - CONTINUOUS

The soldiers sit rocking with the chopper Hernandez sits
with gun in hand his leg drumming the floor nervously

HERNANDEZ
Think we’re gonna see any action

KANE
Where we’re going is so remote I
don’t think even the Taliban give a
fuck

FRANKLIN
Just a little vacation then eh

KANE
In beautiful Afghanistan

EXT AFGHAN LANDSCAPEBLACK HAWK - CONTINUOUS

The chopper skims over the rubble of a flattened village
where children hunt for bullet casings and cheer the
Americans who soar overhead

Two old men on a ridge bow and pray as the chopper blasts
over their backs and jets off into the distance into wide
empty desert

DISSOLVE TO

EXT AFGHAN DESERT - DROP ZONE - DAY

CLOSE on the face of CAPTAIN SINGH 30s Indian handsome
with a neatly trimmed black beard and eyes that speak of
experience He carries a “Dang” walking stick -- a five-foot
bamboo staff with a heavy silver tip

Behind him stands his five-man team of MARCOS -- the Indian
equivalent of Navy Seals They are all bearded black clad --
some have crossbows on their backs They watch as the Black
Hawk comes in and hovers just above the ground several yards
away kicking up a huge dust cloud The Marcos shield their
eyes in unison

Gans and his men leap from the chopper into the swirling
vortex of dust Gans gives a thumbs-up back to the pilot
who lifts the chopper back into the air leaving the men
behind

Silence settles over the soldiers The sun is blazing the
land is wide dry and foreboding

HERNANDEZ
Jesus Mary Gotta be over a
hundred degrees out here

KANE
(checking instrument)
One-eighteen

FRANKLIN
Oh that ain’t right

Teller notices the approaching Marcos

TELLER
Hey check out GI Jihad

HERNANDEZ
Those getups ain’t exactly what I
call camouflage

GANS
Button it

The two sets of soldiers approach each other meeting against
the backdrop of the distant peaks of the Hindu Kush Singh
stands a few inches taller than Gansor maybe it’s just the
turban

SINGH

GANS
Gans Major 505 from the 5th
Army Special Forces

Gans calls back to his men

GANS (CONT’D)
These men are our guides Let’s
form a

SINGH
Excuse me Major Guides

GANS
That’s what I said

SINGH
We are not your guides You are
our support

GANS
This is a US mission

SINGH
Sanctioned by the UN That is us
This region is outside the US
combat mandate The weapons aboard
that plane threaten Peshawar and
the Pakistani tribal areas

GANS
I thought we were all on the same
side Captain

SINGH
We are Major Just you are not
always the one in charge

Gans nods decides not to push it

Singh gives a crisp nod and turns away calling orders to his
men in Hindi Teller steps up to Gans

TELLER
You gonna let a raghead tell us
what to do Major

GANS
Take it easy Teller No one’s
telling anyone what to do

He shoulders his weapon and starts to walk The two sets of
very different soldiers begin marching toward the Kush

DISSOLVE TO

EXT ROCK CANYON - HINDU KUSH - DAY

The men are taking a break in a merciful pocket of shade
eating from MREs Gans eats beside Singh He tips his head
toward Singh’s Dang

GANS
What’s with the walking stick

SINGH
Stick It’s called a Dang It was
my grandfather’s He used it to
kill lions

GANS
They’ve got lions in Pakistan

SINGH
India Major I am Indian

GANS
Oh Right Sorry
Galloway takes a pull at his water bottle -- reacts strongly -
- looks like he’s about to spit
FRANKLIN
Dont waste it Swallow
GALLOWAY
(swallows)

It’s boiling hot
Franklin smiles and nods Takes a swig of his own water

GALLOWAY (CONTD)
So how long have you been out here

FRANKLIN
I’m on my third tour We all are

HERNANDEZ
I got a little girl who was in
diapers when I left now she’s
talking

FRANKLIN
Shell be knocked up by the time
you get home

HERNANDEZ
Don’t even say that That’s not
even funny

TELLER
Know why they call it service
Because we’re all gettin’ serviced
from behind Contractors out here
make triple what we make for doing
the same job and they don’t even
need to go through Basic And you
know what happens if they kill a
civilian They get a ticket home
That’s punishment Shit we killa
raghead and we get court-martialed

The largely silent Marcos look up at the expression
“raghead” Then go back to eating

FRANKLIN
Teller are you sure you want to go
into recruitment when you get home

TELLER
Funny

Silo suddenly lets out a scream and leaps to his feet
drawing all the men into action clutching their guns

KANE
What the hell is it

Silo is pointing his gun at the ground

SILO
Scorpion

ON a large black scorpion trolling the ground for food

Teller marches over and is about to step on it when ARYAN
Singh’s number two pushes him before he can bring his foot
down

Teller falls hard

TELLER
What the fuck man

ARYAN
It’s looking for food It should
not die for that

SILO
Those things can kill

ARYAN
It will not strike a man without
reason

TELLER
Ah I get it Reincarnation
right
(calling to men)
Hey he thinks it’s his
grandmother

He laughs Hernandez joins in Franklin and Galloway look
somewhat embarrassed Teller gets to his feet brushing
himself off

TELLER (CONT’D)
Sorry Granny

He bows mockingly and walks away still laughing The
youngest Marco SAJIT shakes his head looks toward the
desert ahead
SAJIT
Laugh while you can because there
is nothing funny about where we’re
going

This draws the men’s attention

FRANKLIN
What do you mean

SAJIT
I mean we’re headed into an area
that is not meant for men They
say the Kush is the home of the
devil himself

Singh listening beside Gans frowns with disapproval

SAJIT (CONTD)
If it were up to me I would let
the wreckage of that plane lie
where it fell If it was pulled
from the sky then it was for a

reason
TELLER

What the hell are you talking

about
SAJIT

We are walking into a trap
SINGH

Sajit

(in Hindi)
Enough

Sajit goes back to his food chewing hard
Singh turns to Gans

SINGH (CONT’D)
I apologize Major

GANS
For what

SINGH
This country is rife with
superstition Spread their myths
and you find yourself shooting at
shadows It is not the way of a
soldier

GANS
We all carry a rabbit’s foot from
time to time

SINGH
Rabbit’s foot
GANS
Something to keep the bad luck
away
Singh nods
SINGH

For that I have a gun

The scorpion scoots off into the desert having given up on
the hunt for food in this area

DISSOLVE TO

EXT ROCK CANYON LEADING TO CRASH SITE - DAY

The soldiers are again on the march but they’re now passing
through a weird haze like a fog bank the burning globe of
the sun giving all a reddish tint Hernandez scans front and
side

HERNANDEZ
What is this shit
SILO
Fog
ARYAN

There isn’t enough moisture out
here to create fog

TELLER
Thank you Mr Science

Galloway and Franklin walk one behind the other scanning the
mist Even the hardened Marcos look a little unsettled

SINGH
I see something up ahead

GANS
Weapons hot

The men slip their safeties off and hold their weapons ready

EXT B-52H CRASH SITE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

The men move a few steps more and from the mist like a
ghost emerges the massive hulk of the downed B-52 It’s
lying at the end of a deep gash in the earth It’s fuselage
is intact but cracked One wing is long gone the other is
broken and sticking upward like a shark fin Windows are all
blown out Oil drips like blood from the massive engines

The men stand in front of the eerie fog-shrouded wreck Gans
steps forward gun ready

GANS
Anyone in there

Silence Just a creak of metal in the wind

INT B-52H WRECKAGE - DAY

The plane is a tangle of wires and tossed equipment -- much
worse inside than out Gans -- backed by Kane Franklin and
Hernandez -- steps inside guns ready They scan the

creaking interior and the dark passage that leads to the
flight decks

GANS
Franklin hold here while we check
the payload

Gans turns back to the bomb bay Hernandez and Kane follow
leaving Franklin alone

EXT ROCK CAYNONCRASH SITE - DAY

Outside the plane the Marcos stand watch as Teller Silo
and Galloway scout the area Teller notes

TELLER
Fog is starting to lift

INT B-52H WRECKAGE - BOMB BAY - SAME

Gans Kane and Hernandez enter the shattered bomb bay The
bomb bay doors are long gone a pile of earth now packs
against the far wall caught up in the long landing slide
Couplings that once held the bombs hang empty

HERNANDEZ
We’re too late Someone cleaned it
out

GANS
I’m not too sure about that Look
at those couplings They dropped
their load

KANE
On what I wonder

INT B-52H WRECKAGE - MIDSECTION - SAME

Franklin is alone scanning the area A piece of dangling
wreckage is suddenly dislodged and falls drawing his
attention

He steps toward it curious tightening his grip on his gun
There’s movement behind a shattered control panel --

something is hiding breathing

Franklin swallows sweat dripping from his brow He takes
one more ginger step and

A creature leaps from behind the wreckage white fangs and
red mouth screeching toward him

FRANKLIN
SHIT

He falls back firing his gun as the creature leaps onto his
body and launches itself off and toward the open door

EXT ROCK CAYNONCRASH SITE - THAT MOMENT

The sound of Franklin’s gunfire causes the Marcos to drop and
aim their weapons back at the plane where a terrified WOLF
dashes from the doorway and peels off into the desert at

lightning speed

Singh laughs

INT B-52H WRECKAGE - MIDSECTION - SAME

Gans Hernandez and Kane race into the area guns ready
They find Franklin on his back

GANS
What happened

Franklin looks up at them upsidedown eyes wide with terror

FRANKLIN
It was the biggest fuckin’ rat I’ve
ever seen in my life

EXT ROCK CAYNONCRASH SITE - THAT MOMENT
Singh steps toward the fuselage calling out

SINGH
A wolf It was just a wolf

INT B-52H WRECKAGE - MIDSECTION - SAME
Franklin still on his back looks embarrassed

FRANKLIN
Oh Then I guess it was a pretty
small wolf

GANS
Ah huh Let’s check the flight
deck

Gans steps over him and continues toward the flight decks
Kane follows Hernandez smiles and helps Franklin up

EXT B-52H CRASH SITE - DAY

Galloway is scouting the area spotting what appears to be
tracks He follows them toward the front of the plane gun
in hand

INT B-52H WRECKAGE - UPPER FLIGHT DECK

Gans and Kane emerge onto the flight deck Both seats are
sitting empty before shattered windows

KANE
No bodies anywhere Looks like
they survived the crash Major

KANE (CONT’D)
But why leave the plane

Gans moves forward and examines the seat He digs under it
and finds a canteen gives it a shake The slosh of water

GANS
And why leave without this

EXT B-52H CRASH SITE - OPPOSITE SIDE OF PLANE - DAY

Galloway rounds the plane and comes to a sudden halt at what
he sees His face goes pale and he starts to back away
frightened

EXT ROCK CAYNONCRASH SITE - DAY
Gans Kane Hernandez and Franklin emerge from the wreckage

SINGH
Well

GANS
It’s empty No men No payload
It’s just a shell

GALLOWAY (0S)
Major

They turn to see Galloway sprinting around the front of the
aircraftpointing from where he just came He falls and
retches

Gans and the men sprint around the plane toward where
Galloway is pointing Franklin rushes up to Galloway

FRANKLIN
What is it

Galloway looks up at him grim

GALLOWAY
The crew I found the crew

ANGLE - THE B-52 CREWMEN

Theyve been slaughtered and impaled on long spikes
displayed like scarecrows Their faces have been carved into
gruesome clownish expressions Their pants have been
removed and their genitals are thick with blood from
mutilations

GANS
What in holy hell

Even the Marcos are shocked by this
SINGH

This is barbarism It is not like
the Taliban to make such a display
GANS
Al-Qaeda

SINGH
Maybe But I don’t understand the
purpose The message

GANS
The message is clear enough to me
And my answer is going to be just
as clear

He cocks his weapon But Aryan is scanning the area
alone seems to have noticed something unusual

ARYAN
Why are there only four Isn’t the
normal contingent of a B-52 five

men

TELLER
Hey he’s right Major One man is
missing

Gans looks back a measure of hope on his face

GANS
Son of a bitch Means one of our
boys could still be out there

SINGH
Or he died in the crash

GANS
We would have found a body or a
grave if that were the case Silo
scout around for a patch of fresh
earth where we can bury these boys
Then we’ll mount a search for the
fifth man

SINGH
A search

GANS
That’s right

SINGH
Major our mission has been
accomplished We have all the
information that is required A
search for a man who is most likely
dead is pointless

GANS
I don’t leave a man behind

Singh has had it He lets loose with his real feelings

SINGH
There are hundreds of dead men in
these sands The world is awash in
death and suffering yet you expect
the world to stop and grieve only
when the dead are Americans Well
grieve for our own thank you

GANS
These men were soldiers They are
our own Or do you only grieve for
soldiers who tie their hair in
towels

Singh stiffens deeply insulted as was Gans’s intent

SINGH
The turban is sacred Major Id
appreciate it if you wouldn’t
insult it

SILO (0C)
Hey Major

Gans turns to see Silo standing along the rock base looking
down at the ground

SILO (CONTD)
Something here

Gans gives Singh a look then turns and walks down the rock
toward Silo As he steps up Silo points at the rock at his
feet

SILO (CONTD)
Check it out Major

ON a word carved crudely in the rock RAKTAVEEJ
Gans looks up at Galloway
GANS
Hey genius come over here and

tell us what this means

Galloway moves over to him Gans points at the stone
Galloway looks at the word for a beat then shakes his head

GALLOWAY
I don’t know It’s not a word I
mean it’s not an Afghan word
It’s not Dari My guess is it’s
a name

Singh steps up

SINGH
Major

GANS
Any idea what this means Captain

He nods to the carved name Singh looks at it

SINGH
It’s nothing

Hernandez is scanning the ground

HERNANDEZ
There are tracks here Major
Leading into that caynon

GANS
Good We have something to follow

SINGH
So you are still determined to save
your man

GANS
Or kill the motherfuckers who did
this I’11 take either

Singh stares into Gans’s hard face Gans steps close his
tone conciliatory soldier to soldier

GANS (CONT’D)
Come on Captain Let’s stop being
errand boys and go do what soldiers
do This act can’t go unanswered
You know that as well as I

Gans turns and walks back to his men Singh looks to Aryan
who shakes his head

ARYAN
They are reckless

Singh nods Then looks to the gruesome dead men
SINGH
But not entirely wrong

DISSOLVE TO

THE SUN

Beginning to angle toward the horizon MOVE DOWN to

EXT END OF VALLEYCAVE OPENING - DAY

The soldiers walk slowly through an open area at the end of
the valley that is scarred black and pockmarked with signs of
the B-52s bombs that have been unloaded across a section of
the mountain before them The opening to a CAVE sits amid

the shattered rocks

FRANKLIN
Looks like we found the missing
payload

KANE

They bull’s-eyed that cave system
Maybe not such a failed mission
after all

GANS
They had no mission out here HQ
said they were off course

GALLOWAY
They might have released their
payload when they knew they were
going down I’d imagine it‘s a lot
safer to crash land with an empty
belly

The men look at Galloway with a measure of surprise

GANS
That almost makes sense Galloway

Galloway can’t help but looked pleased

TELLER
I was thinkin’ the same thing

FRANKLIN
Sure you were Teller

HERNANDEZ
Tracks lead up into that cave
Major

Suddenly a SCREAM sounds from the mountain before them A

strange disembodied scream -- hard to tell if it’s human or

animal but it’s clearly coming from inside the cave opening
before them

SILO
What the hell was that

KANE
Could have been a man

ARYAN
Being tortured

GANS
I’m going in Kane Hernandez
youre with me Teller Franklin
take up sentry positions on each
side of the valley and watch our
backs Silo take a read on that
cave and radio the coordinates to

his math

SINGH
You’re going in three men strong

GANS
Lean and mean

Singh smirks

SINGH
Have you ever flushed a cave
before Major

GANS
Not from the inside no

SINGH
These caves can run for miles and
they are designed to confuse It’s
necessary to post a man every fifty
yards or you’ll never find your way
back out It also protects from an
ambush

Gans nods

SINGH (CONT’D)
I know these systems I know how
to get in and how to get out
Well go with you

GANS
It’s not necessary I have enough
men to--

SINGH

This needs to be done fast and it
needs to be done right With us
it will be Let’s move We’re
wasting daylight

He and his Marcos shoulder weapons and start to march toward
the cave Gans Kane and Hernandez follow

Teller watches them go shaking his head

TELLER
Show-offs

INT CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

An American flag laid before the cave entrance like a
doormat As the soldiers hit the lip Hernandez stops
sensing something

GANS
You afraid of the dark Hernandez
Move it

Hernandez swallows and heads inside with the men

INT CAVE - ENTRANCENARROW PASSAGE - DAY

The men push through the jagged opening to find it opens into
a larger breezeway Long ago burnt-out lights are strung
along the wall A fine layer of dust hangs in the air
illuminated in the shaft of light from the open Ahead
darkness

Using only hand signals the soldiers moves forward silently
guns held ready
EXT HINDU KUSH CANYON - DAY

Galloway notices Franklin knocking at his compass

GALLOWAY
What’s wrong

FRANKLIN
I don’t know Compass is going
haywire Turns one way and then it
turns the other like it can’t find
north

He snaps it shut and shakes his head

FRANKLIN (CONTD)
Army issue

INT CAVE - ENTRANCEJUNCTIONNARROW PASSAGE - DAY

The soldiers continue down the rocky cavern aiming their
guns at every shadow that could conceal a man their breath
visible in a wave of sudden cold

Singh nods to a Marco who stops and holds position at the
first 50 yard point

The cave grows dark as they round the corner carefully Singh
cracks on a glow stick illuminating the men and cave in
green light

Singh nods off to the young Sajit who stops and stands
sentry at the next 50-yard point He scans the darkness on
each side looking somewhat nervous

They find a section of cave that looks like it’s taken a
large amount of bombing damage They have to slip past
shards of newly fallen rock Singh says quietly

SINGH
This cave suffered too much damage
to still be useful

GANS
Something’s here I can feel it

They round a corner and come to a sudden halt at the sight of
what blocks their path

KANE
Oh shit

REVEAL an unexploded 500-lb JDAM MISSILE precariously lodged
in a pinch of rocks above a narrow chasm

BACK ON THE FIRST MARCO SENTRY

The string of cave lights -- seemingly long dead -- suddenly
snap spark and illuminate The Marco raises his gun
startled at first then puzzled as he looks at the string of
old lights blazing What is powering them

BACK ON GANS SINGH AND THE MEN
facing the unexploded bomb

SINGH
This could be just one of several
unexploded warheads any one of
which could bring this entire cave
down on top of us We need to
abort Now

That’s when a low RUMBLE begins to sound

HERNANDEZ
What’s that

BACK AT THE FIRST MARCO SENTRY

He steps forward in the new light and sees a vortex of air
whirling at the cave entrance seeming to take on a phantom
shape

FIRST MARCO SENTRY
Captain

BACK ON GANS SINGH AND THE MEN

The rumble grows louder and the dirt below their feet seems
to suck forward into the blackness beyond the warhead Rocks
begin to shift and creak causing the bomb to shift It’s
going to fall

GANS
Let’s get the hell out of here

The men take off running as the mysterious vortex of air
seems to rush down the cave holding them back

Behind them the warhead dislodges and the tail flops to the
other side of the shelf its tip now aimed into a shaft of
darkness below

THE MARCO AT THE CAVE ENTRANCE

He’s running forward trying to escape but the mysterious
wind is holding him in place pulling him back

It finally pulls him off his feet and sends him sailing into
a rock wall hard

EXT VALLEY OUTSIDE CAVE - DAY
It’s quiet and still The men outside are oblivious to what
is happening inside the cave

INT CAVE - DAY

The fleeing men pick up Sajit at his position and turn down a
dark tunnel But Gans stops uncertain of their direction

GANS
That’s the wrong way It’s this
way

Behind them the warhead dislodges and DROPS into the
darkness As it does the shaking and the wind stops

A moment of terrible silence in which we see the men running
in SLOW MOTION then

A tremendous explosion RIPS from the black abyss lighting up
the entire cave and for just a split second illuminating a
DEVILISH CREATURE standing in the cavern beyond the weapon

The explosion catches up to the running men and blows them
off their feet

Rock and dirt rain down as the cave collapses

EXT VALLEYCAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

The men watch in horror as the mountain around what was the
cave entrance SINKS amid explosive plumes of dirt and dust

sealing the cave and the men inside

FRANKLIN
Come on

The men dash for the cave-in site

INT CAVE - DEEPER PASSAGE - DAY

Rock and rubble have plugged the entry All is darkness and
choking dust Somewhere a man is SCREAMING in pain

Gans pulls himself free of the rubble and spills out beside
Hernandez who lies holding his leg gashed and bleeding

GANS
You okay

Hernandez nods grimacing

HERNANDEZ
It’s not broken

GANS
Where’s Kane

Kane crawls forward from a pile of rock and rubble

KANE
Here I’m okay I think

GANS
Who’s screaming

HERNANDEZ
Gotta be one of the Marcos

EXT CAVE-IN SITE - DAY

Galloway Franklin Silo and Teller arrive on the scene
searching for any sign of the men or a way into the collapsed
cavern

GALLOWAY

FRANKLIN
There was an explosion Might have
been booby-trapped

TELLER
Those men at the plane The tracks
leading us here This whole thing
is starting to feel like a trap if
you ask me

FRANKLIN
Well I didn’t Get on the blower
and let’s get an SAR in here

INT CAVE - NARROW CAVE-IN TO OPEN AREA - DAY

Gans Kane and Hernandez crawl under low fallen rock
following the sound of the screaming man

They emerge into an open area where Singh and the Marcos are
gathered around one of their own injured and screaming

Singh jabs the man with a morphine pack Then another
Another He finally stops screaming and settles back

GANS
Is he okay

SINGH
He is now His liver was
lacerated It was a slow death I
made it quick

HERNANDEZ
Jesus

SINGH
If that’s a prayer save it
What’s it look like back there

KANE
Sealed We’re not getting out the
way we came that’s for sure

Suddenly an ear-splitting SHRIEK sounds from somewhere in
the cavern

HERNANDEZ
What the hell was that

SINGH
There’s an animal in here

KANE
What kind of an animal makes a
sound like that

Gans holds up his gun

GANS
One that’s gonna be dead if it
fucks with us

Singh stands cracking a fresh glow stick

SINGH
There will be another way out
Come on

He marches forward his men following Gans and Kane follow
Hernandez takes up the rear grimacing with each step

WE REMAIN on the dead Marco lying peacefully as the soldiers
and their light disappear down the cave Suddenly he is
YANKED violently out of frame by an unseen hand

INT CAVE - LOWER PASSAGETHREE-WAY FORK - DAY

The soldiers climb down a jagged series of rock faces and
drop one by one down into a relatively undamaged section of
cave that forks into three passages Hernandez is the last
man he lets loose a small cry as he lands on his injured leg
and falls against a rock

GANS
You sure that leg is okay

HERNANDEZ
It’s fine Major

He forces himself to stand choking back the pain

Singh takes out a match lights it He holds the flame up to
each tunnel entrance

CLOSE as the flame gently sucks toward the tunnel on the
right

Singh blows out the match and starts down that tunnel
Behind him Aryan explains to Kane

ARYAN
Follow the flow of the air Like a
river it will lead to an outlet

The men file into the narrow tunnel the wounded Hernandez
taking up the rear

But after they have taken a few steps something blasts from
a passage behind them and PICKS OFF Hernandez with an ear-
splitting SHRIEK

The men spin Hernandez is gone But his dissipating SCREAM
can be heard traveling down a long smaller cavern

GANS
Come on

The men break into a hard run racing down a smaller cavern
following the sound of the screaming soldier Gans leads the
way running ahead of the light charging into pitch
blackness

The men round a corner where the cavern opens wider Gans
stops and holds trying to listen But Hernandez’s screams
have now stopped

KANE
Major

He directs Gans’s attention to the floor where a TRAIL OF
BLOOD leads into the darkness ahead

Gans readies his gun and follows the blood trail the others
follow As they walk the trail grows thicker Amid the
blood we see what appears to be small semi-cloven
footprints

The blood trail leads the men to the opening of a small cave
in the rock wall From inside they hear movement

Using hand signals Gans motions two Marcos on watch and for
Kane Singh and Aryan to move forward with him

The men raise their weapons and get into formation Gans
gives a nod They move in fast

INT CAVE - SMALL CAVERN - CONTINUOUS

The soldiers enter quickly and flower into an attack
formation guns aimed But they are stunned in horror at the
sight before them

REVEAL -- RAKTAVEEJ

What’s left of Hernandez lies torn open on the ground in
front of a small demonic creature with translucent skin huge
blinking eyes and razor-sharp white teeth Puffs of wiry
black hair dot his otherwise bare body In his oily hands
he holds chunks of human flesh

The demon looks up at them grinning past teeth flecked with
blood and flesh It begins to quiver with an excited
trembling chuckle

Singh looks to Gans who nods The two men have found common
ground in a common enemy

The men take aim at the chuckling devil As they do the
creature opens its black hole of a mouth in a taunting
SCREAM

GANS
Fire

A hail of gunfire tears into the monster shredding it into a
thousand pieces The soldiers don’t let up shooting until
their clips run empty

When they stop shooting nothing is left of the demon except
blood and flesh that drip from the walls and ceiling

KANE
What was that thing Major

GANS
Doesn’t matter now It’s in Hell
EXT CAVE-IN SITE - DAY
The soldiers sit waiting for extraction that hasn’t come

Silo is perched on a large boulder scanning the horizon with
binoculars

SILO
Someone’s coming

They look up at Silo

FRANKLIN

Silo looks down at them grimly

SILO
Ragheads

Teller leaps up and snatches the binoculars from Silo having
a look for himself

ANGLE THROUGH BINOCULARS

An eight-man patrol of Taliban armed to the teeth is
heading directly for the area of destruction

TELLER
Taliban Shit What should we do

Franklin hoists his gun

FRANKLIN
We engage

TELLER
Fuck that I can see from here
that they’re packing RPGs

FRANKLIN
What would you rather do
surrender

pass There’s nothing out here to
fight for Staying alive is all
that matters Isn’t that what the
major always says

SILO

taking cover

INT CAVE - INDOOR OASIS - DAY

Gans Singh Kane Aryan and the two Marcos emerge from a
side passage into a dramatic open cavern Pools of water
fill natural basins in the rocky formations made smooth from
erosion

Singh bends down and scoops a handful of water from a basin
He smells it tastes it

SINGH
It’s fresh

He scoops a larger handful and drinks while the other men
kneel and do the same

Gans scans the area -- there are several dark tunnels that
break off from the main cavern He walks to one of the
passages and peers into the darkness

GANS
Let’s not stay here long

Gans turns and steps to a pool of fresh water reflecting him
like a mirror from below He kneels and washes his hands
bringing the water up to his face

But as the ripples fall still they reflect the image of
someone standing directly behind him

Gans catches the image snatches his gun and spins to face
the snout of a Kalashnikov rifle held by a CLOAKED AFGHAN

The other soldiers spring into action but they also find
themselves surrounded by several ARMED AFGHANS who have
silently appeared from the dark passageways like ghosts

Gans grins into the covered face of his captor

GANS (CONTD)
Climb deep enough into a hole and
youll find a rat

His captor holds the gun steady unblinking

GANS (CONTD)
Killing a man face-to-face is a
little different than strapping a
bomb onto your eleven-year-old
niece and sending her into a
market Sure you got the balls

That’s when the “terrorist” takes off her covering to reveal
a woman -- ZAHARA ALI 22 Afghan pretty but hardened by
life and war She speaks in fluent but accented English

ZAHARA
We are not terrorists We are not
Taliban And what we are doing
here has nothing to do with your
war
(in Afghan to her men)
Lower your weapons

Her men do somewhat reluctantly especially FAZIL Zahara’s
number two and judging from his appearance the most
fanatical of the group

Zahara looks toward Singh and his men

ZAHARA (CONT’D)
What are Marcos doing here

GANS
Why don’t you tell us what you’re
doing here first

Zahara looks back at Gans with a small smile

ZAHARA
Americans Always setting the
conditions Even when you lack the
upper hand

GANS
Were funny like that

ZAHARA
My name is Zahara Ali We are
Pashtun This is our land We
have come to deal with a cave
dweller something you would not
understand or believe even if I
explained it

GANS
Cave dweller eh

Gans looks to Singh then back to Zahara somewhat proud

GANS (CONTD)
If it’s that creature you’re
talking about it’s been dealt
with It’s dead

ZAHARA
Dead How

GANS
It killed one of my men We blew
it into a million pieces

Zahara is stunnedand now suddenly very frightened

ZAHARA
You fool You have no idea what
youve done

EXT CAVE-IN SITE - DAY

The Taliban patrol arrives on the scene of the cave-in No
sign of the men Their COMMANDER sports a thick black beard
and gold-rimmed sunglasses He looks over the area barks an
order

Two men stand guard as the others begin to scour the area
like rats at a dump One of the Taliban sets down his rifle
and starts to take a leak Another pulls down his pants
beside a rock

UP THE INCLINE
The Americans are spread out and hiding behind individual
boulders They’re within sight of one another but not the

Taliban moving around below

Teller appears to be the most nervous especially as a young
TALIBAN SOLDIER slowly makes his way up toward his position

Galloway shoots a look to Franklin calling his attention to
Teller Franklin holds his finger to his lips

Teller is breathing heavily as the Taliban soldier gets
nearer He grips his gun fingers sweaty

Below the Taliban commander looks over the area eyeballing
the ground where he spots a pile of fresh tobacco spittle

Teller is starting to hyperventilate as the Taliban soldier
nears the sounds of his steps growing closer

Franklin grips his gun ready for what looks like inevitable
action Then

TALIBAN COMMANDER
(in Afghan subtitled)
We go

The Taliban soldier stops within three feet of Teller’s
position

But Teller’s panic is at a zenith and as the man turns
Teller swings out and SHOOTS him in the back

Both the Taliban and Americans are forced into fast bloody
action

The Taliban relieving themselves go down before they can get
their pants up or guns aimed The commander is hit and
falls The sentries return fire but Silo coolly takes them
out He is a dead-aim shot

It’s chaotic and ugly with men screaming amid gunfire and
plumes of bloody dirt During the battle Galloway waves his
gun in every direction as bullets impact around him But he
cannot get a shot off He finally finds a charging Taliban
in his sights but he hesitates

The man goes down shot in the chest Galloway turns to see
Franklin has taken the shot for him Franklin gives a quick
nod

Teller screams as he mows the area indiscriminately still
firing long after all the Taliban lie dead

FRANKLIN
Cease fire

The shooting stops Teller tumbles down the hill in a cloud
of dust swinging his weapon panicked He then whoops in
joy when he sees all the Taliban are dead

TELLER
Yeah YEAH Fuckin’-a

Franklin kicks the weapons away from the dead men just in
case

FRANKLIN
What happened to hide and let them
pass

TELLER

He was on top of me man I did
what I had to do

Galloway hears a voice behind him He turns and sees the
injured commander on his stomach calling out urgently into a
walkie-talkie

Galloway raises his weapon

GALLOWAY
(in Afghan subtitled)
Put it down

The commander looks up at him through his shattered
sunglasses then goes back to the radio speaking quickly
getting as much out as he can

Galloway rushes over and kicks the walkie-talkie from his
hand The commander rolls onto his back and goes for
something in his jacket

Galloway FIRES into the man’s chest point-blank

A fountain of blood gurgles up from the man’s mouth as he
dies staring up at Galloway who can’t take his eyes off
him It’s his first kill

Franklin steps up looks to Galloway then kneels down and
searches for what the man was going for -- a wicked knife
He shoves it into the ground beside the dead man’s head

FRANKLIN
Nice work

GALLOWAY
He called in his position

Teller turns his joy instantly replaced with fresh panic

TELLER
He what

FRANKLIN
He called in his position That
means we can expect more company

TELLER
Then let’s get the hell out of
here

FRANKLIN

This is our extraction point Our
orders are to wait and hold

TELLER
How do we know they’1ll even come
and get us

Teller starts gathering up equipment including the radio
FRANKLIN

You’re not taking our radio
Teller

TELLER
Blow me
Franklin draws his sidearm

FRANKLIN
Put it down soldier

Teller draws his gun and aims at Franklin his eyes wild

TELLER
You wanna go let’s go

SILO
Jesus guys

They hold tense Finally Teller lets the radio fall

TELLER
Fine No radio But I’m still
getting the hell out of here

FRANKLIN
Do what you want

Teller looks to Silo

TELLER
You wanna die with these dumbshits
or you want a fighting chance

Silo just looks from man to man unable to make up his mind

TELLER (CONTD)
Just get your pack and come with
me retard

GALLOWAY
Don’t do this Teller We’re safer
if we stick together

TELLER
Uh-huh Like the men at the plane
They were together

He slings his pack over his shoulder turns and marches off
into the desert Silo following

INT CAVE SYSTEM - NATURAL CAVERN - DAY

Zahara shoulders her weapon her eyes wide and full of fear

ZAHARA
We must go now

GANS
Hold up sister We’re not moving
an inch until you tell us what the
hell you’re talking about

ZAHARA
We don’t have time They’1l be
here soon

GANS
Who

Just then from a passage high above a creature leaps from
the darkness with a SCREECH But this is not the same small
devil we saw before This demon is larger “younger” with
long arms and muscular legs and a mouth full of fangs and a
hungry blood-red tongue

Gans FIRES at the creature in midair The demon is sheared
in mid-flight its blood splattering over Kane

But then ANOTHER DEMON charges at Gans from a side cavern
He whirls and UNLOADS into it ANOTHER charges from another
passageand ANOTHER

Suddenly the cavern RAINS DEMONS from all the passages

The Americans and Marcos open fire BLASTING away at the
creatures as Zahara screams over the gunfire

ZAHARA
Stop Stop shooting

But the men continue to unload into the demons who appear to
be offering themselves up as easy targets

Singh shoulders his gun and pulls out his Dang Wielding it
like a martial artist he takes out demons with perfectly
timed strikes to their heads and bodies

But during the shooting Kane stops firing and starts
gagging as if he’s swallowed something

Finally the creatures stop coming The men cease fire
Carnage is everywhere

Gans whirls on Zahara and the Afghans who stand with their
weapons shouldered

GANS
You got bullets in those guns or
what

ZAHARA

You don’t understand They WANT to
be slaughtered It’s how they
increase their numbers

GANS
What

Singh staring out across the slaughter taps Gans on the
shoulder

SINGH
Major

Gans turns and beholds a sight that makes his blood run cold

From every drop of blood from every piece of torn flesh a
new demon is growing Bigger badder meaner and hell-bent
on waging pure WAR These are the BLOODSPAWN

Gans turns to Kanebut Kane -- having been splattered with
demon blood -- is also being transformed The living blood
is tearing into his body where new demonic limbs are
sprouting amid his contortions and screams

Zahara steps forward and pulls a cave light from her cloak
She shines it directly into the still-forming eyes of the
bloodspawn causing them to recoil

In the light we see the collection of demons is diverse
While the majority have grown into perfect bloodspawn those
that have grown from bone or a fingernail are gruesomely
mutated and flop on the ground helplessly

ZAHARA
Follow my men RUN

Gans Singh the Marcos and the Afghans turn into a passage
and run like hell Zahara stays behind and holds off the
bloodspawn But the creatures slowly shake off the effects
of the blinding light and start to advance

Having held them off as long as she can Zahara turns and
runs into the cavern

The bloodspawn surge after her ruthlessly trampling their
mutated cousins

INT CAVE - VARIOUS PASSAGES OFF INDOOR OASIS - CONTINUOUS

The soldiers and Afghans run through the twisting narrow
tunnels with the screeching bloodspawn in close pursuit One
of the Afghans makes the mistake of looking back He runs
into a solid rock wall

Fazil shoves one of his fellow Afghans out of the way
causing the man to fall Creatures swarm over him ripping
him to shreds

Gans stops turns facing a wall of demons looming up from
the darkness He FIRES into the pack his weapon loud in the
confined space the shots giving the passage action a STROBE
effect

One of the Marcos falls impaling himself on his own
crossbow He cries out Singh dashes back to the injured
man and tries to pull him up but several bloodspawn are
already there tugging the soldier the other way

Gans fires along the top of the cave causing rock to fall
down atop the bloodspawn buying a few precious minutes He
turns and runs

The downed Marco screams in agony as the bloodspawn tear into
his waist wound lapping at his blood with long tongues
Singh holds tight but the man tears in half

Singh throws off the half-corpse in time to see a small
“pygmy” bloodspawn leapfrog over the feeding pack screeching
toward him its blood-red mouth open

Singh swats its head clean off with his Dang

SINGH
Saala iblis (Fucking devil)

One of the Afghans makes the mistake of heading down a wrong
passage He reaches a dead end He turns to the darkness
the sound of a dozen bloodspawn nearing

He presses his back against the wall and starts to pray As
the creatures emerge from the darkness his prayers turn to
SCREAMS

INT CAVE - BUNKER - CONTINUOUS
Gans Zahara Aryan Fazil Sajit and two surviving Afghans

tumble into this man-made bunker with cots a stove and
supplies

Zahara quickly unchains a heavy door of rock mesh The door
is on a slant and SLIDES down a wooden rider

GANS
Wait

At the last moment Singh with an army of bloodspawn in
close pursuit dives through the door and spills into the
room

The door slides into place at the base of the chute with a
heavy THUMP The Afghans secure it by attaching the chain to
eye hooks on the far wall as bloodspawn pile up against it on
the other side tearing at the rock with their claws and
screaming in protest

GANS (CONT’D)
There are still men out there

ZAHARA
They are dead We are alive Be
thankful for that

GANS
What the hell are those things

ZAHARA
Bloodspawn

CLOSE as a drop of blood drips from Singh’s Dang onto the
ground

GANS
What

ZAHARA
From every drop of blood a new one
grows

GANS
Impossible

ZAHARA
Can you deny what you have seen
with your own eyes

Behind Singh we see a bloodspawn growing from the drop of
blood Fazil turns and spots the demon just in time

FAZIL
Look out

Singh dives out of the way as Gans raises his gun but Zahara
slaps it down

ZAHARA
No Don’t shed its blood

Singh leaps forward and grabs the still-forming creature by
the throat He locks his hands around it as it continues to
grow lifting him off his feet

SINGH
Help me

Gans Aryan and Sajit leap forward and hold the thrashing
demon as Zahara snatches Singh’s Dang She quickly wipes it
clean of blood then throws the rag onto a gas hot plate

The rag begins to quiver and shake as the blood comes to
life Zahara turns on the gas flame and burns the rag

The men struggle to restrain the now fully-grown bloodspawn
Singh is eye-to-eye with the monster which spits in his
face trying to shake free of Singh’s grasp

It takes several tense minutes but the creature finally
suffocates in Singh’s hands and falls limp never even having
tasted air

The creature and men fall to the ground An exhausted Singh
looks over the corpse at Gans nods

SINGH (CONT’D)
Thank you

Fazil moves to Zahara at the stove He speaks quietly but
firmly to her in Afghan

FAZIL
(in Afghan subtitled)
We should kill these men now

ZAHARA
(in Afghan subtitled)
Kill them

FAZIL
(in Afghan subtitled)
They can only prevent us from
accomplishing what we have come
here to do

Fazil’s hand goes to his weapon

FAZIL (CONTD)
(in Afghan subtitled)
I will do it if you lack the
courage

ZAHARA
(in Afghan subtitled)
These men will share our fate
That is enough And dont ever
question my courage

EXT AFGHAN DESERT - DUSK

Teller and Silo march through the darkness of the endless
desert Even with night falling and the desert cooling they
perspire Teller stops looks around shaking his head

TELLER
Doesn’t make sense

He looks at the compass

TELLER (CONTD)

It just keeps turning Like
nothing out here makes sense How
are you supposed to find your way
in a country that doesn’t make
sense

Silo takes a seat on a boulder

SILO
Maybe we should go back

TELLER
And get a spike up my ass No
thanks Besides
(looking around)
I don’t even know which direction
we came from

That’s when something seems to whiz past him a phantom voice
that makes him spin and Silo spring to his feet

TELLER (CONT’D)
What the fuck was that

Silo shakes his head Teller scans the darkness Then a
sound -- a VOICE -- calling to them mockingly

Teller FIRES his gun at nothing
TELLER (CONTD)

Youre fuckin’ with the United
States of America here

The desert doesn’t look impressed Silo backs up
frightened Suddenly a dozen cloaked figures SPRING from
beneath sand-covered blankets knives gleaming

CUT TO

EXT CAVE-IN SITE - DUSK

A strange sight -- the dead Taliban soldiers are propped up
in foxholes several feet apart holding their guns aimed at
the now darkening desert

Franklin props up the dead Taliban commander completing a
bogus defensive line making the dead men appear to be
Northern Alliance fighters

He drops into a trench beside Galloway who’s scanning the
desert with binoculars

FRANKLIN
That’s it A little morbid I
know but at least we’1l look like
an army

A buzzard lands on one of the dead men Franklin waves his
arm at it

FRANKLIN (CONTD)
Get out of here

The buzzard looks at him Franklin points his gun at the
bird

The bird just screeches back at him not budging Franklin
withdraws his weapon shaking his head

FRANKLIN (CONTD)
Even the birds around here are
assholes
Galloway looks at the Taliban commander the man he killed

The commander turns his dead face toward Galloway smiling

Galloway blinks away the vision looks away Franklin
catches his expression

FRANKLIN (CONTD)
You did what you had to do Don’t
let it get to you

GALLOWAY
It’s not That’s the thing
What’s bothering me is that itit
isn’t bothering me I killeda
man and all I can think about
is

FRANKLIN
What

GALLOWAY
How I could do it again

Franklin nods Takes the binoculars from him

FRANKLIN
You need some rest I’11 take the
first watch You can --

He cuts off when he sees Galloway looking past his shoulder
Franklin turns seeing what Galloway sees a wake trail of
dust rising from the desert

FRANKLIN (CONTD)
Shit

He raises the binoculars to his eyes
POV THROUGH BINOCULARS

It’s a unit of Taliban in vehicles moving quickly toward the
area waving guns

INT CAVE - TUNNEL OUTSIDE OF BUNKER - CONTINUOUS

The horde of bloodspawn claw at the soft rock around the
bunker door attempting to dig their way inside Among the
pack is the transformed Kane -- half-man half-bloodspawn --
an eerie evolution

INT CAVE - BUNKER - CONTINUOUS

Gans is searching the room pulling back curtains and cots
Fazil is watching him closely hand on his gun ready to
spring

GANS
This is a man-made bunker There’s
gotta be more than one way out
ZAHARA
Of course There was But your
air strike destroyed it That’s
why we had to enter from the
valley

GANS
That strike was an accident

ZAHARA
No Major It was no accident

Just then Gans pulls back a curtain and finds a chemical
weapon lying on a cot Markings indicate it’s Russian
rigged with a harness and hand trigger -- a suicide WMD

It’s

Fazil is on his feet but Gans whirls on him his gun aimed

GANS
You say you are not terrorists
then what’s this

ZAHARA
We stole it from the Taliban At
great cost I might add

GANS
Why

ZAHARA
I told you We’re here to deal
with a cave dweller Raktaveej
A demon whose blood can spring the
army of Hell He drew your bomber
here to free him from the bowels of
the earth and now your bullets
have unleashed his army

Zahara points to the WMD on the cot and continues

ZAHARA (CONTD)
This was the solution A chemical
weapon A way to kill without
bloodshed But we thought we only
had to deal with one creature
Now thanks to you we face
hundreds maybe thousands

SINGH
Why’s it rigged with a hand trigger
and body harness

ZAHARA
Because the only way to be certain
of your target is to be staring it
in the eye when the deathblow is
delivered

GANS
Are you telling us you’re going to
hand-detonate that thing down here

ZAHARA
Yes

She turns and walks back across the room

GANS
That’s a suicide mission

ZAHARA
Sometimes defeating an enemy
requires the ultimate sacrifice
I’m sorry you are here but that
was your choice And now I’m
afraid it is also your fate

EXT CAVE-IN SITE - NIGHT

The dark night is illuminated with the EXPLOSIONS from a
firefight as Galloway and Franklin battle the Taliban unit
below They move in trenches dug between foxholes and fire
from the positions of each dead man completing the illusion
that the Taliban are up against a larger force

Franklin flops down beside Galloway They are both sweaty
dirty and exhausted

FRANKLIN
I’ve only got one more clip

GALLOWAY
Then you got one more than me

They fire together then drop back as fire is returned
sending geysers of dirt above their heads

FRANKLIN
I say we pull back over this ridge
while we still can We’1l go out
on separate flanks I’11 cover
you Go

Galloway breaks to the left flank keeping down behind the
dead soldiers as the Taliban unleash a fresh volley of fire
from below

Franklin fires down at the Taliban until his gun runs dry
He then breaks for the right But an RPG missile sails at
him from below

The missile blows Franklin from the foxhole He rolls down
the hill in a cloud of dust toward the Taliban line

Galloway sees the injured Franklin lying exposed He leaps
out of the trench and slides back down to his friend kicking
up a trail of dust Below we hear the shouts of the Taliban
and see the men advancing

Galloway reaches Franklin who lies bleeding and injured He
struggles to speak while pushing Galloway away

FRANKLIN (CONTD)
Go

The advancing Taliban shout at Galloway in Afghan to drop his
weapon

GALLOWAY
Hang in there my friend

Galloway tosses down his gun and raises his hands The
Taliban arrive eyes wild still screaming at Galloway

The COMMANDER pushes past his men and sees the “army” they’ve
been fighting are dead Taliban He laughs As do his men

GALLOWAY (CONTD)
(in Afghan subtitled)
This man is injured He needs
help

The laughing stops The Taliban commander looks at him
surprised to see an American speaking their tongue

GALLOWAY (CONTD)
(in Afghan subtitled)
For the sake of his mother

The Taliban commander nods then turns his pistol on Franklin
and SHOOTS him in the head

Galloway lunges for him in a rage but the Taliban soldiers
are on him in a flash holding him back by the hair

The Taliban commander steps up and plants his gun against
Galloway’s temple

TALIBAN COMMANDER
(in Afghan subtitled)
Allah will bring you to justice

Galloway closes his eyes

A GUNSHOT rings out

Galloway flinches But his eyes flash open in time to see
blood running from a bullet hole in the center of the Taliban
commander’s forehead

The man falls straight back and hits the ground dead

Then from each side of the mountain WARRIORS ON HORSEBACK
emerge wielding swords and high-tech machine guns They

attack and slaughter the remaining Taliban with savagery and
skill slicing off heads and limbs showing no mercy

Galloway can hardly believe his eyes It’s as if the
medieval past has suddenly burst from the darkness He grabs
his gun and remains crouched amid the dust of the charging
horses

When the slaughter ceases all the Taliban lie dead except
for one man who begs for his life on his knees He gets a
boot in the face for his prayers

The mysterious men scavenge for weapons as a large black
stallion steps up to Galloway

Galloway looks up to find himself facing a ferocious WARLORD
His chest is crisscrossed with two bandoliers RPG on his
back jeweled sword in hand

WARLORD
(in Afghan subtitled)
Bring him

Two of the warlord’s men grab Galloway and force him on a
horse Galloway turns and sees the captured Taliban is also
being forced to mount a horse

WARLORD (CONTD)
(in Afghan subtitled)
We go

The warlord gallops away His men follow Galloway is
carried away with the men who disappear back into the night
as quickly and mysteriously as they had appeared

INT CAVE - BUNKER - CONTINUOUS

Zahara and the Afghans are saying a prayer preparing for
their mission as Gans frantically searches the room -- the
walls -- running his hand along what appears to be an
artificial seam in the rock

He pulls his knife and digs loose rock from the seam Singh
steps up to him

SINGH
What have you found

GANS
I think there was once a passage
here

Singh pulls out his own knife and helps Gans dig at the seam

The Afghans complete their prayer Fazil stands and slings
on the WMD Gans sees this and steps quickly toward them

GANS (CONT’D)
Wait We found something There
used to be a passage there

ZAHARA
What of it

GANS
It might be a way out

Singh’s knife punches through the seam and slides freely He
peeks through the hole He then takes his Dang and shoves it
in -- it slides all the way in

SINGH
It’s a tunnel

GANS
You hear that

ZAHARA
Our task is not to get out It is
to destroy the creatures And that
is what we are going to do

Fazil steps to the door finger on the trigger of the WMD as
another Afghan begins to unhook the chain that secures it

Gans draws his gun and points it at Zahara and the men

GANS
I can’t let you do that

ZAHARA
A bullet can’t stop us We are
already prepared to die

GANS
Listen you said it yourself You
came to kill one creature now
there are hundreds maybe
thousands How can you be certain
the poison from the bomb will reach
them all If just one survives
you will have sacrificed yourself
for nothing

ZAHARA
This weapon can destroy an army

Singh appears looking to Zahara

SINGH
You’re wrong I was part of a team
that decommission Russian ordinance
after the Cold War I know these
weapons It is only a tactical
device The major is right If
you detonate it you will only
succeed in killing us and a handful
of the creatures at best

FAZIL
He’s lying

He moves to the door

ZAHARA
Wait

She looks back at Gans It’s clear that she’d rather not die
but

ZAHARA (CONTD)
I made a promise to my people that
I would rid them of this threat

GANS
And you will with our help If we
escape we can warn our people
about what is in this cave and have
a better chance of dealing with
these creatures ALL of them

FAZIL
(in Afghan subtitled)
They are cowards Zahara Do not
listen to them

During this exchange we see Sajit moving quietly around the
back of Fazil Zahara shakes her head

ZAHARA
I was a young girl when the
Russians invaded our country They
said they would build us schools
and dig wells if we would help them
battle the mujahideen They did
nothing but ravage the land with
bombs and kill our people And
then the CIA offered to help us if
we rose against the Russians
Constant promises yet my whole
life I have watched friends and
family die from diseases that I
know in the West can be cured with
a pill

GANS
Forget governments This is a
personal promise from me to you I
will get you out of here and find a
way to destroy these creatures

Sajit suddenly grabs Fazil from behind Singh leaps forward
and cuts the wires of the WMD with his knife separating the
hand trigger and bomb

Singh steps back with the trigger in his hand

SINGH
Now it is settled

GANS
You didn’t need to do that

SINGH
Didnt I

He shoots a look at Fazil then pockets the trigger and turns
back to the rock wall Gans looks back at Zahara She just
shakes her head

ZAHARA
You ask us to trust you but you do
not trust us

Off Gans somewhat guilty look we

spots something ahead -- two mutilated men on spikes
displayed up like scarecrows -- Teller and Silo

The captive Taliban riding behind them whimpers and prays
as they pass the dead men

The men dig at the bunker wall while bloodspawn dig at the
other side of the door the sound of them growing louder

chunk of bunker wall falls inward into the passage Aryan
cracks on a fresh glow stick and looks inside

ARYAN
Damn

SINGH
What is it

ARYAN
It’s not a tunnel Looks more like
a ventilation shaft

Gans has a look -- the cave is a narrow crawlspace only big
enough for one person at a time

GANS
It will still lead somewhere

SAJIT
What’s that smell

FAZIL (0S)
Death

They look to Fazil who sits smirking

FAZIL (CONTD)
You have opened a tomb A grave

Gans looks back into the dark passage choked with cobwebs
and dust

GANS
Well just be trading one grave for
another

He climbs into the passage and crawls on his belly using
elbows and knees The others line up to follow Zahara
looks to Fazil

Galloway stripped of his equipment is escorted by two armed
men through the halls filled with stockpiles of weapons and
consumer goods He passes a room where armed Afghans watch
The Sopranos on a big screen plasma TV

In the room beside it the TALIBAN who was captured alongside
Galloway is being stripped and hooked up to electrodes The
man looks up at Galloway as he passes his eyes filled with
fear

Galloway is shoved forward

INT WARLORD COMPOUND - FEASTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The warlord and his men sit on pillows and boil meat in
steaming bowls of water along a series of low interconnecting
tables A heavy door is opened and Galloway is shoved in

Conversation falls quiet The men eyeball him critically
At the head of the table the warlord barks

WARLORD
(in Afghan subtitled)
Leave him

The armed men back away The warlord sucking on a lamb
chop waves Galloway forward with a greasy hand

Galloway walks past the seated men who chuckle as he passes
He steps up to the warlord who spits a load of fat onto the
floor

WARLORD (CONTD)
(subtitled in English
Peace be with you)

Salaam aleikum

GALLOWAY

unto you be peace)

The warlord nods then extends his hand to a pillow across
from him

WARLORD
Sit Eat Speak English to me
And in English tell me what the
Americans are doing in the Kush

Galloway sits looking at the warlord through a steaming
water bowl

GALLOWAY
We came to recon a downed plane
Search for survivors

WARLORD
And you found them dead like those
men in the desert

GALLOWAY
Do you know what happened to them

The warlord just sucks the marrow from a bone seeming to
ignore the question He throws down the bone and looks at

Galloway

WARLORD
Do you know how old I am Huh I
am 200 years old

His men chuckle Galloway looks at the men who watch him

expectantly
WARLORD (CONTD)

Do you believe me That I am 200
years old

GALLOWAY
Does it matter what I believe

The men fall silent The warlord’s face falls That was the
wrong answer Galloway shifts in his seat

GALLOWAY (CONTD)
Okay No No I don’t believe

you

WARLORD
And this is something you feel in
your heart is true A true fact

GALLOWAY
It’s impossible

WARLORD
Would you stake your life on it
His men smile Galloway squirms doesn’t like where this is
going
GALLOWAY

Stake my life on the fact that you
are not 200 years old

The warlord nods

GALLOWAY (CONTD)
If I had to yes

WARLORD
But what if we in Afghanistan
measure our years differently from
you What if we use the cycle of
the stars instead of the sun What
if our “year” is only three months
by your calendar

GALLOWAY
You didn’t say that

WARLORD
It is not for me to say This is
my home My country You should
have known it before you challenged
me

The men fall quiet The warlord looks at Galloway
menacingly

WARLORD (CONTD)
Especially as you have staked your
life on it

GALLOWAY
Well I assumed we were speaking
hypothetically

He gives a laugh looks to the men No one else is laughing

Galloway stifles his laughter and looks back at the warlord
pretty nervous now

GALLOWAY (CONTD)
Youre right It was foolish of me
to assume I apologize

WARLORD
(with disgust)
A soldier never apologizes At
least not to the enemy

GALLOWAY
Are you my enemy

The warlord looks at him and smiles for the first time

WARLORD
I am no one’s enemy I am no one’s
friend I am Afghanistan

With fading glow stick Gans crawls from the narrow rock
shaft and drops into a sealed room his feet crunching into

something unseen
As the others emerge Gans cracks on a new glow stick

The stick illuminates a sea of skeletons and partially
mummified remains filling the passage

SINGH
He was right It is a tomb

Gans squats shifting through the remains examining them
He shakes his head

GANS
No This isn’t a burial These
men died here It’s a massacre

ZAHARA
Who were they

Gans finds a small lapel pin -- a hammer and sickle

GANS
Russian

SINGH
These men are wearing the clothes
of mujahideen

ZAHARA
They killed each other

GANS
I don’t think so These men were
fighting side by side Against a
common enemy

ZAHARA
Russians and Afghans fighting
together

takes a small bite Chews

Asshole of goat

Galloway stops chewing

The warlord is talking to the man we saw wiring up the
Taliban prisoner in the torture chamber He appears to be
giving instructions on how to behead the man -- holding his
own hair and running his hand along his own neck showing
where to cut

Galloway reaches for a piece of fruit

GALLOWAY
You have a lot of modern equipment
around here

WARLORD

Gifts from your government Do you
know I have my own satellite Up
in outer space Given to me by
your CIA to help find bin Laden I
believe it costs your taxpayers a
million dollars a year

(laughs)
We use it to watch football

GALLOWAY
Tell me do you have any idea what
Raktaveej means

The men instantly stop eating and look to Galloway with fear
in their eyes

The warlord nods slowly He then wipes his face and barks a

command
leave
alone

Galloway watches as the men all get up and quickly

The door closes leaving Galloway and the warlord

WARLORD
When one of my men says that name
out loud -- I remove his tongue
GALLOWAY
So it is a name
WARLORD

A most foul name Raktaveej is an
ancient warrior of hell who laid
siege on the Gods with a plague of
demon warriors

(MORE)

WARLORD (CONTD)
So destructive was Raktaveej that
the Gods called forth the even more
powerful warrior Goddess Kali who
defeated the demon army by lapping
them up with her tongue forever
imprisoning Raktaveej in her belly -
- that which today we call the
Hindu Kush

GALLOWAY
These mountains

The warlord nods

WARLORD
But Raktaveej remains a living
force in these hills shaping the
minds and motives of men baiting
them to commit evil deeds and acts
of war

GALLOWAY
But this is mythology

WARLORD
All history becomes mythology given
time The truth is this war has
freed Raktaveej in his most
virulent form Those dead men you
found were killed by the tribes who
live in the Kush as an appeasement
to Raktaveej and strung up as a
warning to stay away from his lair
For you see Raktaveej will try to
draw you in tempting you with fear
and hate and tricks But should
you shed his blood even a drop
his warriors will grow And from
their blood will spring more and
more until an unstoppable army of
hell overruns the earth

He leans close the charcoal firelight of the serving table
reflecting off his face

gods can save us

frowns

GANS
They’re in Russian

ZAHARA

Gans hands over the paperwork Just then bloodspawn reach
the other side of the barricade and begin tearing through
hungering for the men on the other side

Zahara throws aside the instructions disconnects the hose
from the canister and quickly reverses it

We learned as children that Russian

weapons are just like American

only everything is in reverse

Gans aims at the barricade pulls the triggerand still
nothing

is reversed then He reaches over and flips the switch

The flamethrower takes Gans by surprise as it comes to life
SPITTING FLAMES into the boxes tearing through and igniting
the Kane-spawn on the other side

The other bloodspawn shrink back shielding their eyes from

the sounds of the enraged bloodspawn behind them

They near an area that opens into a larger cave but when
they hit the lip they have to stop fast

REVEAL - THE CHASM

It’s a huge void that appears to be the remains of an indoor
landslide Cavities of sheer rock fall 400 feet into
darkness Across the void is the continuation of the cave
passage but it is only accessible via a twisting series of
four rope extensions that look to have been strung up during
the time of the Russians

Singh shakes his head

SINGH
These ropes are at least 20 years
old How do we know they’11l hold

Gans fingers the rope of the first extension -- it’s frayed
and dusty coming apart in his fingers He continues flaking
it away until he reaches a core that appears solid He gives
it a tug and it holds for now

GANS
I’1l go first

ZAHARA
Major I’m lighter Shouldn’t I
go first

GANS
If they hold me they’1ll hold
everyone

Gans turns and steps out onto the rope Each extension is
made up of three ropes -- a single rope to balance while
gripping two higher guide lines Gans walks out gingerly
his boot causing the rope to strain and flake but it holds

It’s a tense tightrope walk to the first tower of rock where
the first extension ends Gans steps onto the rock to the
relief of all

barricade has burned away so the “wall of fire” effect is
gone and the bloodspawn can see through the glowing embers
at the tunnel in the distance

INT CAVE - CHASM - CONTINUOUS

Gans steps onto a second rock peak as Zahara starts across
the sagging extension and Singh now crosses the first

The way the ropes angle from peak to peak gives us a view of
all three of them at the same time as well as the nervous men
still waiting for their turn to cross

BACK ON THE BLOODSPAWN

They have the bulk of the flaming barricade dismantled Some
lie dead and burning That’s when a bloodspawn from the back
charges forward and SMASHES through the final timbers
breaking open a passage for all

BACK TO CHASM

Gans arrives at the second-to-last peak One more rope
extension to go Aryan is now crossing the first Zahara is
dead center of the sagging rope when a SHRIEK suddenly fills
the chasm

Sajit on the ledge turns and yells

SAJIT
Here they come

All start to cross the ropes more quickly Zahara makes it
to one peak and out across another extension as Singh now
rushes out onto the sagging rope Aryan close behind him

Sajit lets the two Afghans go ahead of him as he aims his gun
at the darkness waiting for the bloodspawn

Singh loses his footing and dangles for a tense moment but
recovers

Zahara reaches the peak where Gans stands He lets her pass
and start across the final extension as he kneels and aims
the flamethrower across the chasm at the doorway of the cave

Sajit watches the darkness where bloodspawn suddenly appear
eyes and teeth gleaming

He FIRES The bloodspawn hit the wall of bullets and are
shredded More and more pile out one from behind the other

Sajit holds the trigger so tightly his finger bleeds as he
empties his clip into the creatures in a blood-soaked last
stand

On the sagging rope one of the Afghans loses his balance and
falls with a scream into the darkness The other carrying
the WMD dashes out in his place

Sajit runs out of bullets He looks up as the bloodspawn
burst from the tunnel and hit him like a freight train

That’s when Gans opens up with the flamethrower

The flame spits across the chasm and ignites bloodspawn who
spiral off into the chasm and land on lower outcrops of rock
their burning corpses illuminating the scene with pockets of
flame making it look even more like the ramparts of Hell

The flamethrower starts to run dry as some of the bloodspawn
slip past and leap to the ropes and rocks

A bloodspawn is closing on the Afghan with the WMD Zahara
the only one so far to have made it to the other side calls
out

ZAHARA
The weapon Throw us the weapon

The Afghan takes off the WMD and relays it to Singh who
barely catches it The Afghan spins to fight but the
bloodspawn are on him killing him horribly

Aryan joins Singh on the rock peak Singh cuts the rope
severing the long-sagging connection between the two high
peaks and sending two bloodspawn into the abyss He then
begins crossing the second-to-last bridge carrying the WMD

Gans throws off his empty flamethrower and steps to the last
rope extension to Zahara -- and it breaks

ZAHARA (CONTD)
Major

Gans falls bouncing off a hard rock catching hold of a
ledge 20 feet below Zahara where he dangles

Singh makes it to the peak but now sees he has no way
across He throws the WMD across the abyss to Zahara She
then holds out her other hand

ZAHARA (CONTD)
The trigger

Singh looks at her hesitant

ZAHARA (CONT’D)
Hurry

Below Gans pulls himself up onto a ledge where he finds
himself hopelessly trapped A falling bloodspawn catches him
by the boot and tries to bite his ankle Gans kicks the
creature in the head with his other boot It falls into the
abyss screaming at him as it falls

Singh pulls the trigger from his pocket a beat then he goes
to lob it over to Zahara But as he throws he’s nudged from
behind by Aryan

The trigger is thrown wild Zahara dashes for it but it
hits the lip of the cliff and bounces back into the abyss

where it is CAUGHT by Gans on the ledge below

On the peak Singh spins on Aryan -- but instead of Aryan he
finds himself facing Aryan transformed into a bloodspawn

Zahara fires her Kalashnikov and blows away the transformed
Aryan Singh watches his last and best man fall into the
abyss He looks up to see more bloodspawn advancing Now
he’s pissed

Singh pulls his Dang and fights off a wave of bloodspawn who
leap across the chasm toward him

Zahara continues shooting shredding the creatures and the
ropes

Gans has to dodge the splattering blood drops that fill the
cavern some of it springing to life the second it hits hot
rock

Singh bats away the last bloodspawn and turns to Zahara on
the ledge He takes a breath and makes a leap

Singh flies toward Zaharaand falls short He snags the
harness of the WMD held by Zahara releasing the grip on his
Dang

The Dang falls past Gans who looks up and sees Singh
dangling over him by the strap of the WMD

Zahara uses all her strength to pull Singh up He catches
hold of the ledge and pulls himself to safety

Gans looks at the blood-soaked rocks all around him literally
crawling with blood

Singh looks down over the edge to see Gans trapped below
The walls are smooth with no way for Gans to climb up

SINGH
Major

Gans looks up at him shakes his head

GANS
Get out of here You don’t have
much time

Singh sees the fresh blood is already beginning to form --
the chasm will soon be filled with thousands of bloodspawn

SINGH
You forget Major I don’t take
orders from you

Singh unwraps his turban Beneath his black hair is long and
flowing He then lowers the length of cloth down to Gans
twirling it into a rope as he does

Gans shakes his head

GANS
Crazy bastard

He grips the turban “rope” and starts to climb
It’s a race against time as the bloodspawn grow and come to

life opening their bug eyes sprouting teeth -- and finally
giving off their horrible war cry

Zahara helps Singh pull Gans up over the lip Gans hands
Singh back his length of turban and gives a firm nod

GANS (CONT’D)
Thank you

The regenerated army of bloodspawn are now so numerous that
they are building towers of their bodies allowing others to
reach the far side

ZAHARA
Let’s go

Singh and Zahara turn to run but Gans steps forward facing
the chasm

SINGH
Major

Gans pulls a Russian MORTAR from his belt

GANS
I’m sick of running

He throws the mortar into the mass of bloodspawn It hits a
central outcrop of rock dead center and EXPLODES

The tremendous explosion blows apart the bloodspawn tower and
causes the central rock peak to break and fall like a great
obelisk It crashes against another peak causing it to
shatter and they both fall literally bringing down the roof
in a spectacular continuation of this indoor landslide

Gans grins at the destruction as hard rock smashes into the
bloodspawn making them burst with blood and bone However
the collapse doesn’t stop with just the chasm

GANS (CONTD)
Oh shit

Gans turns and runs as the entire cave starts to collapse
behind him The three survivors run as fast as they can --
but they are unable to outrun the steamrolling destruction

Zahara holds the WMD against her chest as the floor gives out
and she falls among crumbling rock

Gans and Singh also go down as the mountain seems to flood
from above sucking all down into the depths of the earth in
a vortex of dirt and rock

EXT WARLORD COMMPOUND - DAWN

We are shocked by the sudden SILENCE of the desert at
sunrise PULL BACK to find Galloway standing just outside
the compound gates looking toward the empty horizon the
warlord standing at his back

GALLOWAY
I don’t understand why they never
came for us

WARLORD
No one sends an army to save one
man It is not practical

Galloway turns and looks at him

GALLOWAY
I don’t believe that

WARLORD
You should rest Then my men will
take you to the Kotal-e Salang
pass The UN use it as an artery
into Kabul You will be able to
get transport

GALLOWAY
Youre letting me go

WARLORD
The Americans won’t listen to a man
like me They need to hear it from
one of their own Tell them what I
have told you of Raktaveej Warn
them to stay out of the Kush

GALLOWAY
And you think they would believe
me Hell I’m not even sure if I
believe it myself

WARLORD
I’ve done what I can It is in
your hands now

The warlord turns and marches back into the compound leaving
Galloway standing alone
INT SUB CAVE SYSTEM - MOMENTS LATER

Zahara crawls from a pack of dirt holding the WMD She
checks it for damage None Thank goodness

She stands and looks around She’s fallen into a sub cave
system with catacombs of curved rock that look organic and
strange There’s no sign of Singh or Gans

Clutching the WMD she starts to move down the passage She
hits a dead end But there is a darkened rock chute above
her A way out maybe

Zahara shoulders the WMD and starts to climb up the rock
wall

INT SUB CAVE SYSTEM - ANOTHER CATACOMB - SAME TIME

CLOSE as a hand shoots from the earth clutching at the air
The stub finger tells us it’s Gans He pulls himself from
the rubble and falls painfully to the ground clutching his
arm

His cry alerts Singh across the catacomb He comes over to
Gans and kneels -- blood flows from a gash on Singh’s
forehead

SINGH
You hurt

GANS
My arm’s broken

Gans makes himself a sling out of his shirt tying it off
with his teeth Singh can’t help but give a nod of
admiration

SINGH
I’1l say one thing for you
American You don’t give up

GANS
Never Where’s our girl
SINGH
I can’t find her Or the weapon
GANS
Who cares about the weapon
SINGH
I do The smallest leak could kill

us all

Gans looks at him

GANS
I thought you said it wasn’t
powerful

SINGH

I would have said anything to stop
her from detonating it The truth
is that weapon could kill an entire
army It’s extremely powerful

GANS
Terrific I kind of liked not
knowing that

He stands holding the gun in his good arm

GANS (CONT’D)
Zahara

BACK ON ZAHARA

She’s far up on the rock wall She turns at the sound of
Gans’s distant voice but in doing so loses her footing
She tumbles down a hard slanting chute and falls on the
ground -- which collapses and sends her into

THE DEATH PIT

Zahara falls into something that cushions her fall and sends
up a cloud of dust She stands eyes closed waving away the
dust When she opens her eyes she finds herself facing a
dozen BLOODSPAWN

She SCREAMS

SINGH AND GANS

hear Zahara’s scream They dash toward the sound

BACK IN THE PIT

Zahara fights for her life as bloodspawn seem to swarm her
She punches one hard in the face -- and its head shreds
That’s when she realizes these bloodspawn are dead

mummified

GANS (0S) (CONT’D)
Zahara

ZAHARA
I’m down here

SINGH AND GANS

are standing above the pit Gans looks to Singh taps his
head

GANS
How about it

Singh gives Gans a frown then starts to unwrap his turban
again

TIME CUT

Zahara is pulled from the pit via Singh’s turban When she
emerges they are startled to see she’s holding a dead dried
bloodspawn She drops the creature to the ground

ZAHARA
There’s a whole nest of them down
there All dead These are
probably the creatures that killed
those Russians we found

SINGH
But what killed them

Gans kneels over the body looking closely at the dead
creature He takes out his knife and stabs it in the dried
chest

ZAHARA
What are you doing

GANS
An autopsy Let’s find out what
makes these things tick

He rips open the carcass exposing the dusty remains of the
chest He pulls out what looks like a gigantic dried prune
and holds it up

SINGH
The heart

ZAHARA
It’s huge

GANS

Three times the size of a human
heart The blood flow going though
these creatures must be incredible
SINGH
Seeing them in action I think
that’s obvious

Gans tosses aside the heart and cuts away at the abdomen

roots around for a period of time

his hands

GANS
That’s interesting

ZAHARA
What is it

GANS
Well either the stomach is too
small to find or it doesn’t have
one

SINGH
No stomach But we’ve seen them
eat

GANS
Have we We’ve seen them chew
flesh but my guess is they’re
after the blood It’s blood that
fuels these things and bloodshed
is the only way they sustain their
numbers And that tells us how
they died

ZAHARA
They starved

GANS
Exactly These creatures are made
for one thing and one thing only
War Blood in blood out If they
don’t get either they die off
Probably at an accelerated rate I
suspect those Russians we found
discovered this That’s why they
sealed this cavern from the inside
To hold them here Keep them from
getting to the surface

ZAHARA
Starve them of war

Then sits back dusting

They hear the cries of bloodspawn ECHOING in the passages

above as if the entire mountain is now full of them

He

SINGH
What do you think would happen if
they got to the surface now

GANS
God help us There’s no shortage
of war out there

EXT MOUNTAIN PASS - DAY (DREAM)

Galloway is standing alone beside a road in the desert
holding his gun waiting for his ride A scorpion moves
across the sand Galloway watches it closely As he does
two Black Hawk helicopters come in fast and silent They
suddenly scream over his head causing him to look up

American soldiers onboard laugh and point at him as they
drift away Galloway just watches without emotion

Behind Galloway now stands the dead Taliban Commander The
man mumbles something that sounds like backwards gibberish

Galloway turns but finds himself facing Raktaveej -- who
screams at him with his black mouth and blood-red tongue

Galloway is running for his life pulling off his clothes
crying huffing and puffing as if he’s been running for days
He looks back

And sees himself dressed in a cap and gown receiving a
diploma from Major Gans

Galloway shakes his head and suddenly runs off a huge
cliff the mighty expanse of the Afghan desert opening up
like a mouth below him

INT WARLORD COMMPOUND - DAY

A loud SOUND makes Galloway’s eyes flash open He’s nodded
off in a chair in a small room above the compound courtyard
He turns to see one of the warlord’s men has dropped his

equipment -- gun radio Kevlar vest etc -- onto the floor

The man nods and quickly leaves

INT SUB CAVE - VARIOUS PASSAGES - SAME TIME

Bloodspawn have regenerated and move in packs through the
catacombs of the mountains searching for their prey

INT SUB CAVE - PASSAGE TO TEMPLE - DAY

Singh Zahara and Gans push deeper into the sub cave They
round a corner and find themselves standing at the end of a
long passage ribbed like the inside of a giant whale At
the end of the passage is a point of light burning like a
furnace

ZAHARA
What is it

GANS
I don’t know
(scanning corridor)
But there’s nowhere else to go

SINGH
The proverbial light at the end of
the tunnel eh Major

They move down the passage toward the light As they walk
ghostly whispers seem to streak past their ears The walls
begin to take on organic spooky and strange shapes

A doorway looms ahead with a peaked top almost like an

entrance to a cathedral Beyond is the dusty light They
pass through guns ready and emerge inside

INT SUB CAVE - TEMPLE OF RAKTAVEEJ - CONTINUOUS

It’s unlike anything we’ve yet seen -- the architecture of
Hell Great pointed pillars hold up concave walls Eerie
pictographs are carved into the walls -- the history of the

demon warriors going back to the dawn of man and before

SINGH
What is this place

Zahara is looking at a pictograph showing a sea of human
corpses spread out before a single triumphant demon --
Raktaveej

ZAHARA
We are in the belly of Kali -- the
very lair of Raktaveej himself

SINGH
You mean we’ve marched into Hell

ZAHARA
A version of it Yes

Gans looks over the carvings One appears to be an army of
bloodspawn battling dinosaurs Another shows the armies of
Alexander He says quietly to himself

GANS
The X factor

SINGH
What’s that Major

Gans turns nods toward an alcove across the chamber

GANS
The light’s coming from in there

They move toward it entering the small room through an arch

There sitting in a pool of light in the center of this tall
cylindrical room is a huge pile of BONES remains of men and
animals one on top of the other Gans looks up the light
shaft to see the source is a hole high in the center of the
ceiling

GANS (CONT’D)
That’s the sky

Zahara is looking at the pile of dried carcasses sucked free
of blood -- a goat the most recent

ZAHARA
The opening is a hole in the desert
floor We’re in a food trap

GANS
There’s no way we’re climbing up
there But if I’m looking at open
sky that means

He whips out his GPS and radio -- clicks them on -- they have
a signal Gans smiles

GANS (CONT’D)
It means we can call for help

INT WARLORD COMPOUND - FEASTING ROOM - DAY

The men are gathered around the tables smoking from hookahs
the warlord at the head of the table The door bursts open
and Galloway enters shoving past the guards

GALLOWAY
I need your help My commanding
officer is alive but trapped
(MORE )

GALLOWAY (CONTD)
He’s in a cave I have the
coordinates He said --

He stops himself short

WARLORD
Said what

GALLOWAY
That there are creatures down there
that will soon attack

WARLORD
More than one

GALLOWAY
Help me

WARLORD

If they have pierced the belly of
Kali and unleashed the army of
Hell then it is best to leave them
trapped

He goes back to smoking as do his men
GALLOWAY
(in Afghan subtitled)

You are a coward

The warlord’s eyes flash up at him His men can’t believe
what they’ve just heard

WARLORD
What did you say

GALLOWAY
You sit here on a mountain of
looted goods and play all sides
against the otherfor what You
know what’s really wrong with this
country Why this land is a
godforsaken desert of poverty and
warring tribes Because of men
like you Men who have the ability
to lead it into the modern world
but instead grow fat off its
suffering

WARLORD
You again challenge me I wonder
if you completely understand now
what you are doing

GALLOWAY
(in Afghan subtitled)
I say it again You are a filthy
coward

The warlord barks a command His men draw their weapons
But Galloway has his gun out and aimed at the warlord -- who
just chews on his hookah

WARLORD
I do not believe you have thought
about your exit strategy

GALLOWAY
Tell them to lower their guns

WARLORD
Perhaps I will tell them to fire

GALLOWAY
They fire and you die

The warlord looks at Galloway with a mix of puzzlement and
admiration

WARLORD
I don’t understand you I give you
your life I offer you freedom and
you risk it all for other men
Why

GALLOWAY
Because their lives matter

WARLORD
Above your own

GALLOWAY
It’s called civilization You
should try it sometime

EXT WARLORD COMPOUND - COURTYARD - DAY
Men bring a horse heavy with supplies to a back door Above

Afghans swarm the ramparts taking up positions aiming their
guns into the dusty courtyard below

EXT WARLORD COMPOUND - COURTYARD - DAY

Galloway and the warlord emerge into the bright light of day
and the crown of guns aimed from above

Galloway looks up at the armed men then to the warlord who
extends his hand to the horse

WARLORD
It is what you asked for

Galloway checks the supplies then shoulders his gun and
mounts the horse As he does he notices two armed Afghans
on horseback wielding guns watching him

GALLOWAY
Tell them to open the gate

WARLORD
You speak the language

GALLOWAY
(in Afghan subtitled)
Open the gate

The men do not budge The horsemen glare The warlord
smiles He then steps forward

WARLORD
(subtitled in Afghan)
Open the gate

Two men rush forward and open the huge wooden gate to the
empty desert

Galloway gives the horse a light kick and starts to cross the
courtyard under the barrels of the many guns

All is quiet Angry faces glare at him as he passes
Galloway looks straight ahead as he nears the doorway
feeling the guns on his back

The men on the ramparts change position dashing across the
roof and now aiming their guns into the desert as Galloway
passes through the door

A gunner on the rampart looks to the warlord who watches
Galloway clear the shadow then

WARLORD (CONTD)
(in Afghan subtitled)
Let him go

Galloway kicks the horse into action and gallops away The
warlord frowns looking truly troubled

WARLORD (CONTD)
(in Afghan subtitled)
There is no escape from fate

EXT DESERT - DAY

Galloway blasts across the desert on his horse looking back
He’s not being followed He checks his GPS then kicks the
horse into faster action

INT SUB CAVE - TEMPLEFEEDING CHAMBER - DAY

A bloodspawn walks into the main room slowly sniffing the
air Zahara gasps Singh and Gans spin raising their
weapons

But strangely enough the creature doesn’t attack Instead
it stands across the room staring at them its pupils fixing
into slits

GANS
Hold your fire until absolutely
necessary

SINGH
Yes That much I know by now

The men hold their weapons on the lone bloodspawn But
instead of rushing them the creature cranes his head upward
and starts to give off a loud honking alert with an almost
sonic frequency

VARIOUS SHOTS

The CRY echoes through the entire mountain and across all the
locations we’ve seen in the film the remains of the chasm
the Russian ammo depot the bunker the indoor oasis the
collapsed breezeway even out over the dead men with the name
Raktaveej carved below them in the stone

We also see ALL the bloodspawn moving in unison toward the
temple in the bowels of the cave called to battle

EXT DESERT ABOVE TEMPLE - DAY

Galloway rides into the area watching the GPS He scans the
rocky desert but sees nothing He hops off the horse and
searches the area GPS in hand

INT SUB CAVE - TEMPLEFEEDING CHAMBER - SAME TIME

The bloodspawn are entering the temple lining up Singh and

Gans back away guns aimed Zahara stands behind them
cradling the WMD

EXT DESERT ABOVE TEMPLE - DAY

Galloway walks the desert watching the GPS perplexed he’s
at the spot but

He suddenly drops out of frame

INT SUB CAVE - TEMPLEFEEDING CHAMBER - SAME

The GPS lands atop the pile of bones shattering Gans looks
up and sees Galloway dangling from the lip of the hole his
kicking legs causing shadows to dance across the scene

GANS
Galloway

A bloodspawn screams at the soldiers Gans and Singh turn
back guns ready

EXT DESERT ABOVE TEMPLE - DAY

Galloway pulls himself up with great effort He stands and
dashes to the horse retrieving the heavy rope He dashes
back to the hole and drops the rope through -- feeding it
down to Gans

INT SUB CAVE - TEMPLEFEEDING CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Gans watches the rope snaking down as the temple continues to
fill with creatures He catches it and gives it a tug then

passes it to Zahara

GANS
Go

Zahara nods slings the WMD onto her back and starts to
climb Seeing her the bloodspawn shriek and attack

Gans and Singh open FIRE

Zahara climbs while Gans and Singh cut back the waves of
bloodspawn below her

EXT DESERT ABOVE TEMPLE - DAY

Galloway holds the rope taut trying to help pull Zahara up

INT SUB CAVE - TEMPLEFEEDING CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Gans and Singh back up against the bone pile continuing to
fire at the bloodspawn They turn back to back and cut down
the demons that now encircle them

EXT DESERT ABOVE TEMPLE - DAY

Zaharas hand dances above the lip of the hole Galloway
falls forward and catches it helping to pull her up

INT SUB CAVE - TEMPLEFEEDING CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Singh looks up to see Zahara slip through the hole -- safe
But as he’s looking up a bloodspawn leaps for him

GANS
Captain

The bloodspawn is in the air as Singh turns Gans raises his
gun and lets loose blowing apart the creature’s skull

And splattering Singh with its blood

A frozen moment of horror between Singh and Gans Nothing to
say they both know the score

SINGH
GO

Singh turns and walks into the bloodspawn pack shooting a
continuous stream of fire using his final moments of human
life to kill as many of the monsters as he can

Galloway peers down from above

GALLOWAY
Climb Major

Gans looks up but then turns back to the battle Why
doesn’t he climb

EXT DESERT ABOVE TEMPLE - DAY

Zahara crawls forward to Galloway

ZAHARA
He can’t He has a broken arm

INT SUB CAVE - TEMPLEFEEDING CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Gans’s gun suddenly runs dry No ammo That’s it He
tosses his gun aside resigned ready to fight hand to hand

Singh’s own gun drops to the floor MOVE UP to find it’s
because he’s now undergoing the full torments of
transformation

EXT DESERT ABOVE TEMPLE - DAY

Galloway racks his brain There must be a way That’s when
the snort of his horse sparks an idea

He calls down to Gans
GALLOWAY
Major Tie the rope around you and

hold on tight

GANS
Forget about me

GALLOWAY
Just do it damn it

Galloway jumps up and loops the rope around the horse

INT SUB CAVE - TEMPLEFEEDING CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
Gans ties the rope around himself but a scream alerts him

He looks up to see Singh fully transformed into a bloodspawn
warrior leading the others as they advance

Gans spits and smiles ready to die

GANS
Bring it on you desert rats

The bloodspawn leap for him as

EXT DESERT ABOVE TEMPLE - DAY

Galloway SLAPS the rear of the horse causing it to BOLT into
the desert trailing the rope

INT SUB CAVE - TEMPLEFEEDING CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT

Gans is whisked UPWARDS just out of the grasp of the
bloodspawn He sails quickly up toward the hole The
bloodspawn watch him go screeching in fury

But as Gans slips through the small opening his last Russian
mortar is dislodged from his belt and FALLS back into the
temple

ON THE MORTAR

as it falls toward the pack of bloodspawn They look up
screaming at it welcoming it

The mortar hits the ground and BLOWS the creatures to bits
But it also shatters the support beams of the temple and
causes the walls to begin to collapse

EXT DESERT ABOVE TEMPLE - SAME TIME

Gans is dragged into the desert by the still-galloping horse
He pulls his knife and cuts the rope letting the horse and

rope trail off into the desert

Zahara and Galloway rush to him Gans gives Galloway a rare
smile

GANS
Nice work

But then the ground beneath them starts to shake like an
earthquake

ZAHARA
What’s happening

Gans expression tells us he knows exactly what is happening
GANS
Run
INT SUB CAVE - TEMPLEFEEDING CHAMBER - SAME
Desert sand is now pouring into the room from above as the
entire temple collapses in on itself
EXT DESERT - CONTINUOUS

Gans Galloway and Zahara run as a gigantic SINK HOLE opens
up in the desert floor behind them

GANS
Don’t look back Just keep
running

The sinkhole grows larger until it becomes a HUGE CRATER

Gans Galloway and Zahara dash up the crater edge as it
widens and pulls the sand from beneath their feet

They hit the top and throw themselves up and over the lip
spilling down over the edge where they hit hard desert earth

The ground settles The roar of earth stops There’s a moon-
-like crater where the Temple of Raktaveej once existed

Gans Galloway and Zahara exchange relieved smiles Then

A BLOODSPAWN spits from the soft sand of the crater center
followed by ANOTHER and ANOTHER and ANOTHER Like ants
pouring from an anthill the bloodspawn emerge from the earth
and into the light of day

Gans stands watching the crater FILLING with virulent
bloodspawn They form into legions -- becoming a massive
army before them

Galloway can’t believe his eyes

GALLOWAY
What are they Major
GANS
You don’t know Galloway You

should
Galloway looks at him puzzled Gans cocks a grin

GANS (CONT’D)
It’s your X factor

The creatures raise their arms and deliver a war cry

Suddenly an EXPLOSION erupts from the center of the
bloodspawn army blowing the creatures high into the air

An A-10 WARTHOG screams overheadfollowed by F-18 HORNETS
and AH-64 APACHES It’s the long-overdue extraction force
unloading their massive firepower into the demon army
obliterating dozens with every blast

A familiar Black Hawk helicopter swoops in behind Gans
hovering just over the ground kicking up an incredible
sandstorm

A door along the side slides open and a fresh-faced US
soldier waves them in

US SOLDIER
Come on

The trio dashes for the open helicopter door as the planes
and helicopters continue to hammer the bloodspawn army with
Hellfire missiles spreading their blood and body parts far
and wide

Gans Galloway and Zahara are pulled up into the Black Hawk

The soldier motions to the pilot -- the same “crazy” pilot
who dropped them off -- and the chopper begins to rise

INT BLACK HAWK - AIRBORNE - DAY
As they pull up into the air Zahara looks out over the scene
-- seeing the full extent of the bloodspawn slaughter She

shakes her head

ZAHARA
They’11 create millions

MORE SHOTS

of the bloodspawn being taken out by the American forces

The soldiers whoop and cheer But from the slaughter are now
growing more

Tens of thousands of bloodspawn An unstoppable army of Hell
lets loose on the earth

INT BLACK HAWK - AIRBORNE - DAY

Gans pulls from his pocket the trigger of the WMD He looks
at Zahara who nods No words necessary

GALLOWAY
What is that Major

GANS
The only way

Gans gets up and moves to the pilot
GANS (CONT’D)
Do you have gas masks aboard this

bird

PILOT
Of course

GANS
Put ‘emon Everyone Then fly me
to the center of that soup

Gans moves back to Zahara and takes from her the WMD He
strips the wires with his teeth and rewires the device

ZAHARA
But this weapon isn’t powerful
enough

GANS

What Singh told you wasn’t true
This weapon can decimate an army

Gans shouts to the pilot

GANS (CONT’D)
Call in the order to pull out
Everyone Tell them a chemical
weapon is about to go off

Gans stands strapping on the WMD as gas masks are
distributed to all the men and the chopper swings toward the
action

ZAHARA
Major

Gans turns Zahara looks into his eyes pain in her face

ZAHARA (CONTD)
This was my mission It is my
fate Let me do it

GANS
I made you a promise remember
And you didn’t create that army
down there I did It’s my war

Newly-formed creatures are rising from the bloody sand
shrieking up at the Black Hawk hovering above

Zahara’s eyes are starting to fill with tears Gans just
smiles

GANS (CONTD)
Look into the eyes of your enemy
isn’t that how you said it was
done

Zahara nods Gans turns CLOSE as he takes hold of the
trigger -- the stump of his finger fitting perfectly atop it
as if it were made for this one task

Gans LEAPS from the chopper

Galloway and Zahara move forward and watch as Gans plummets
to the earth -- as he is swallowed into the center of the
bloodspawn he detonates the bomb spreading a ring of
chemical death out into the forming army

GALLOWAY
Go

They pull on their gas masks as the Black Hawk banks hard
away from the scene

VARIOUS SHOTS

The bloodspawn shiver and die in various states of
regeneration It’s an incredibly gruesome mass slaughter

THE BLACK HAWK

arches out and over the desert retreating from the scene
with the rest of the American forces leaving behind carnage
that blankets the desert floor for miles in all directions

EXT DESERT AIRFIELD - DAY

We’re back at the desert airfield a sunset burns over the
sands

INT DESERT AIRFIELD - COMMAND AND CONTROL - DAY

Galloway is sitting in a folding chair calmly relating the
events of the past 48 hours for Colonel Fox and Saddler

GALLOWAY
That’s when our forces came in and
opened fire on the creatures But
the destruction only caused them to
multiply So Major Gans used the
chemical weapon against them He
sacrificed himself to save us all

COLONEL FOX
A demon army from Hell

Galloway just nods

ON the men looking down at him Skeptical To say the
least

OFF IN A CORNER - MINUTES LATER
Saddler and Fox confer out of earshot of Galloway

COLONEL FOX (CONTD)
He’s obviously suffering from shock
and fatigue The desert can do
strange things to a man One thing
is for sure we cannot allow his
report to the State Department to
include this fantasy

CIA SADDLER
But if there’s any truth to what
he’s saying it may be worth
looking into

Fox gives him a look

CIA SADDLER (CONTD)
I’m just saying The concept of an
army that regenerates itselfit’s
interesting

Galloway sitting alone looks toward the men who are now
engaged in conversation seeming to forget he’s even there

Galloway swallows unsure of his future his fate

INT C-130 TRANSPORT - AIRFIELD - DAY

Zahara is loaded into a C-130 full of other Afghans Many
look frightened Zahara sits down across from a terrified
young boy sitting beside his father

Zahara gives him a warm smile

ZAHARA
(in Afghan subtitled)
Dont worry Theres nothing to be
afraid of Were safe now

The door begins to close giving off a loud mechanical whine
Zahara takes one last look at the Afghan desert out beyond
the airfield as the huge metal door closes out the image and
the light with an authoritative CLANK

On the door is stenciled the plane’s destination GUANTANAMO

DISSOLVE TO

EXT AFGHAN DESERT - DAY

The warlord walks amid the sprawling blanket of death across
the desert his face covered with a veil He stops and looks
down at a corpse in the blackened sand

THE CORPSE

It’s what is left of Major Gans Charred His head a
blackened skull his hand still clutching the trigger of the
WMD

ANGLE UP ON THE WARLORD

Looking down at the American The man who defeated an Army --
in the tradition of the gods

But then a BLOODSPAWN warrior rises silently behind him
Leering It raises its arm aiming at the back of his skull
then brings it slashing forward in a vicious lightning
strike

BLACK

THE END
