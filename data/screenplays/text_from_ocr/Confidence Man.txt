TEASER
EXT BEACH - SECLUDED AREA - DAY (DAY 9) 1

A LONE FIGURE walks down the beach We’re nowhere near the
WRECK This is straight up PRISTINE And the figure is --

-- KATE Carrying canvas bags overflowing with BANANAS as
she comes upon A PILE OF CLOTHES folded neatly beside A PACK
OF CIGARETTES and a worn PAPERBACK of WATERSHIP DOWN

Curious Kate kneels to examine the book -- then a SHOUT --

SAWYER (0S)
Helluva book

Kate stiffens turns to the WATER Finds SAWYER bare-
chested as he wades back to land Smiles --

SAWYER (CONTD)
It’s about bunnies

Sawyer emerges from the water walking toward her The look
on Kate’s face says it all as he steps into frame to reveal --

-- he’s BARE-ASS NAKED and yeah he could put his clothes
on but nope he’s gonna stand here waiting for a reaction

Kate just looks at him -- and he just looks at her Daring
her eyes to drop Finally

KATE
Water’s cold huh

Ouch But Sawyer GRINS --
SAWYER
You bet How ‘bout you come a

little closer and warm me up

Okay she reviles the guy but damn if there isn’t chemistry
here Not that she’d ever cop to it

KATE
Does this ever actually work

SAWYER
Depends on what you mean by “this”

SAWYER
KATE
This This macho -- “Macho” Ain’t heard that
one in awhile Makes me
wanna grow a mustache

Kate just shakes her head Why fucking bother
KATE
You sure know how to make a girl
feel special Sawyer
We PUSH IN TIGHT ON SAWYER as Kate walks off --
INT HOTEL ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK 2

-- and in LOUD vocal response to Kate’s comment --

JESSICA
QOH YEAH BABY YEAH--

-- a SILHOUETTED COUPLE in the throes of passion it’s SAWYER
and JESSICA as attractive as she is acrobatic --

SAWYER
-- I LOVE YoU --

-- and we avoid most Standards and Practices issues with this
GOLDEN AFTERNOON BACKLIGHT we barely see them at all But
gimme a break -- it’s clear what’s up So to speak

CUT TO VARIOUS SHOTS HIS JEANS ON THE FLOOR HER BRA AND
DRESS A PAPER-WRAPPED BOUQUET OF FLOWERS (From Sawyer

Wow that’s unlike him) And that’s when we HEAR A BLOODY-
MURDER-SCREAM of female ecstasy --

-- and they both collapse breathless sweaty and HAPPY

JESSICA
«boy oh boy

SAWYER
--Boy oh boy is right

He laughs kissing her hand Still catching their breath he
looks at her Touches her face Uncharacteristically sweet

SAWYER (CONT’D)
--look at you
(then with a smile)
What do you want Right now

LOST Confidence Man (NETWORK DRAFT) 9804
(CONTD) 2
Staring at him her eyes actually fill up Quietly

JESSICA
How could I want anything else

Sawyer hugs her Kisses her Holds her tight She
obviously means a great deal to him But she sees something

JESSICA (CONTD) SAWYER
Uh-oh Baby--
What
JESSICA (CONTD) SAWYER

I thought you had a meeting--
Yeah it’s not until six-
thirty--

JESSICA (CONTD)
Baby it’s six-twenty-eight

And Sawyer bolts back -- sees the time --

SAWYER
Are you -- Oh damnit -- damnit --
Honey listen to me--

Jessica smiles post-coital bliss

JESSICA
Go you go I’ll stay here watch
TV order room service get fat--

Sawyer kisses her stomach -- then bounds for the closet
pulling up his pants

SAWYER
You order a chocolate sundae When
I get back I’1l use you as a dish

Jessica laughs sitting up sheets covering her breasts as
Sawyer pulls down a SUITCASE which FALLS SPILLS OPEN --
Jessica looks over to see the case FILLED WITH CASH

Awkward Sawyer freezes Jessica is shocked Sawyer stands
there motionless and guilty He avoids her gaze - but
finally his eyes meet hers And all he can muster is

SAWYER (CONTD)
--eyou uh weren’t exactly
supposed to see that

And on the shock and oddity of the moment we’re BACK ON

EXT JUNGLE - DAY 3

SAWYER -- hair still wet and a smile on his face

He walks through the jungle Off the beaten path It’s
dark SECLUDED Hears a NOISE up ahead and he tenses up

The sound has triggered an alarm ANIMAL INSTINCT takes
over Sawyer RUNS -- bursting through the BRUSH to find --

A fellow CASTAWAY (RICHARD 50’s) Rifling through some
SUITCASES - tossing aside booze cigarettes sunscreen

this is a CACHE OF BOOTY from the plane crash And
there’s no doubt it belongs to --

SAWYER
What’re you doing in my stuff son

Richard JUMPS at the sound of Sawyer’s voice from behind him
A SHARP INTAKE OF BREATH PRE-LAPS into --

JACK (0S)
This is gonna hurt

INT THE VALLEY - INFIRMARY CAVE - DAY 4

A small amount of PEROXIDE spills onto a cloth in the hands
of JACK Sitting outside what we’ll call THE INFIRMARY CAVE
Jack cleans a nasty HEAD WOUND on --

SAYID
I can do this myself

JACK
You ready to tell me what happened

SAYID remains focused denying himself the pain We stay
CLOSE -- this conversation feels private CONSPIRATORIAL

SAYID
We were trying to triangulate the
transmission The French woman
(OW but talks on)
I saw the flare from the beach --
Then the flare from Sawyer’s
position in the jungle I turned
on my antenna activated the
transceiver then -- darkness
(intense)
Whoever hit me came from behind

JACK
They destroyed the equipment

SAYID
(that motherfucker)
Yes

JACK SAYID
Any idea who it
-- A coward

JACK
We’ll figure this out man Don’t
do anything that

And when Sayid looks at Jack there is an ANGER -- a FIRE
that we have not seen in his eyes before

SAYID
I will do what I need to do to find
the man responsible

ON JACK as that sinks in for a moment before -- A SHOUT
echoes through the caves --

WOMAN’S VOICE (0S)
Where’s the doctor Help us
Please

Jack rushes out to see a frantic WOMAN hobbling in Her name
is MARYBETH (40s pretty)

Marybeth breathes heavily -- the result of supporting her
beaten and bloody husband whom we recognize as Richard last
seen pillaging Sawyer’s stash

Jack ducks under Richard’s arm and helps him to the cave

JACK
Who did this to you

And with fierce determination the man manages a single word--

RICHARD
Sawyer

And OFF JACK --
CUT TO BLACK

ACT ONE
INT THE VALLEY - INFIRMARY CAVE - DAY 5

Sitting on a ledge Jack dabs another cloth infused with
peroxide on a cut over Richard’s eye Richard winces

RICHARD
I’m fine It’s just a scrape

JACK
Lots of scrapes today I’m running
out of peroxide

RICHARD
I should’ve been able to take him
Sonofabitch fights dirty

JACK
-- yeah I’ve seen that -- so you
wanna tell me what happened

Richard points out MARYBETH at the stream with HURLEY

RICHARD

Marybeth’s - my wife’s - asthma

(off Jack’s look)
I packed a few inhalers for our
trip Marybeth said put them in my
carry-on but I said - hey -
vacation’s over we’re on the
plane she can’t need more than the
one - right

(beat)
The one ran out yesterday So Im
scouring the wreckage - Marybeth’s
freaking - and then I see that
bastard Sawyer just sitting there
reading “Watership Down”

JACK
You’re losing me

RICHARD
“Watership Down” It’s a book It
was in our luggage -- the stuff we

checked Looked for the last week
but we couldn’t find it

(before Jack can ask)
If he’s got my book then he’s got
my suitcase He’s got my suitcase

Richard STOPS Looks up at Jack complete desperation in his
eyes

RICHARD (CONTD)
It‘ll be bad man

And we’re TIGHT ON JACK -- The look in his eyes makes it
clear that he is ready to DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT --

EXT BEACH - DAY 6

WAVES CRASH as we find a more sparsely-populated BEACH Many
of the castaways have moved to the caves

but not CLAIRE who wears her FLOPPY HAT and sits in her
disembodied PLANE SEAT as she writes in her JOURNAL So
engrossed she doesn’t see --

CHARLIE (0S)
Morning delivery

CHARLIE offering TWO BOTTLES OF WATER She smiles There’s
a nascent connection between these two and yeah even hints
of ROMANCE

CLAIRE
You’re sweet

CHARLIE
Figured in your condition y’know
with the extra “baggage”

CLAIRE

CHARLIE
Barely Anyway I worry about you

their day with sand fleas

CLAIRE
I want to be here Charlie
(serious believing)
For when we get rescued

CHARLIE
Right For when we get rescued

And OFF CHARLIE knowing full well that ain’t gonna happen

EXT BEACH - SAWYER’S TENT - DAY 7
Sawyer sits and smokes just outside his TENT on the beach
doing something we haven’t seen him do since the PILOT --

Reading his LETTER

Worn Creased A mystery But whatever it says it
provokes a strong emotional reaction in Sawyer - and it

looks a lot like PAIN But Sawyer’s reverie is broken as he

hears a question -- posed more as a guttural threat
JACK (0S)

Where is it

Sawyer quickly folds up the letter but he does not get up

SAWYER
Hey Doc Long time no see

JACK
Where is it

SAWYER
Where’s what

JACK
The woman’s asthma medication
Her inhalers

SAWYER
Oh That

JACK
You attacked a man because he was
trying to help his sick wife

SAWYER
No -- I whooped a thief ‘cause he
was going through my stuff--

JACK
Yours What makes it yours man
You think because you take it out
of a suitcase --

SAWYER
Look -- I don’t know what kinda
Commie sharefest you’re runnin’
over in Cave Town -- but down here

possession’s nine tenths and a
man’s got a right to protect his
property

Jack’s had just about enough of this shit

JACK
Get up
SAWYER
Why You wanna see who’s taller
JACK
Get Up
SAWYER

You sure you wanna make this your
problem Doc

JACK
Yeah I’m sure

And so Sawyer gets up Jack takes a step toward him -- so
ready to fucking rumble that he misses the arrival of --

KATE (0S)
What’s going on

-- Sawyer turns to see KATE

SAWYER
We were just exchangin’ recipes

Jack REACTS to Kate’s presence FUCK Doesn’t want to kick
Sawyer’s ass in front of her Eager to take advantage of
this Sawyer flashes that GRIN --

LOST Confidence Man (NETWORK DRAFT) 9804
(CONTD) 7

SAWYER (CONT’D)
Sorry we couldn’t work things out
Doc

And as Kate wonders what she just stepped into we STAY WITH
SAWYER as he walks off -- CLOSING in and once we’re TIGHT
PAN DOWN to see his fist closed tightly around THAT LETTER

And off that image we SMASH INTO

INT HOTEL ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK 8

The SUITCASE FULL OF CASH Over this we HEAR

JESSICA (0S) SAWYER (0S)
You told me you were going to I am -- Jess this isn’t
Baton Rouge to close a deal -- exactly the kind of thing
you said it was “too boring that’s easy to describe--

to explain”--

And we see SAWYER AND JESSICA -- she’s in a bra and panties
he’s in his jeans shirtless

SAWYER
Just trust me There isn’t time to
explain I’m already late and if I
don’t make this meeting this whole
thing’s a bust all right

SILENCE The two just stare Sawyer feels guilty and

then -- because he likes her -- he reluctantly decides “fine

at the risk of losing it all here it is”

SAWYER (CONTD)
Ever heard of Incentive Law

Of course not He sighs and then in a kind quiet voice

SAWYER (CONT’D)
Encourages foreign business here in
New Orleans -- Tax breaks Shared
investments The government sets
up these private funds To
supplement foreign trade

JESSICA
Do I need an Economics degree to
understand why you have a suitcase
full of cash

LOST Confidence Man (NETWORK DRAFT) 9804 11
(CONTD) 8

SAWYER
You’re looking at everything
Everything I got Hundred and
forty thousand dollars

She watches him Though that’s a lot of money her reaction
her lack of shock at that number tells us a lot Shes
familiar with money Sawyer’s almost sad as he speaks

SAWYER (CONTD)
There’s an oil mining operation in
the Gulf of Mexico -- drilling
platforms Three-hundred thousand
dollars buys you one share

(beat)

But as soon as you make that
investment that fund kicks in and
triples your investment in two

weeks Triples it

JESSICA
Three-hundred thousand
(off his look)
You got a hundred and forty

SAWYER
That would explain my meeting
wouldn’t it

JESSICA
You’re meeting with someone who has
the rest of the money

SAWYER

(a sigh then)
There’s this Canadian guy wants in
fifty-fifty Two weeks - we’l1l be
splitting almost a million bucks
Is it shady Yeah A little

(beat a slow smile)
But I gotta All right I meet
the Canuck and make this deal
happen -- I can pay for a lot more
hotel rooms lemme tell you

A beat Jessica’s wheels turning Then ALL BUSINESS

JESSICA
There’s another option

SAWYER
what’s that
LOST Confidence Man (NETWORK DRAFT) 9804
(CONTD) JESSICA
That you don’t go to the meeting
That you stay here That we make
love again And that I give you
the hundred-and-sixty thousand
And we split it

Sawyer stares at her -- a smile creeping up on his face
SAWYER
How the hell you gonna scare up a
hundred-and-sixty thousand bucks

Now it’s her turn to smile

JESSICA
My husband

OFF SAWYER CLOSE ENOUGH to get the sense that he is most
definitely running some kind of GAME here --

JACK (PRE-LAP)
I’m gonna kill him

EXT BEACH - DAY

Jack storms down the beach fucking FRUSTRATED Kate trails

KATE
That won’t get us the medicine

JACK
Maybe not But it’1ll feel good

KATE
Okay So what’s stopping you

Jack looks at Kate -- SURPRISED She’s serious He thinks

about it Shakes his head --

JACK
We’re not savages yet Kate

She nods Then --
KATE JACK
Let me talk to Sawyer
-- What

KATE
I can reason with him

LOST Confidence Man (NETWORK DRAFT) 9804 13
(CONTD) 9

JACK
This guy doesn’t know reason

KATE
Maybe not But my plan is still
better than yours

Jack looks at her Fortunately he likes Kate more than he
hates Sawyer Smiles despite himself

JACK
What makes you think he’1ll listen
KATE
He says we have a connection

And although he’s probably not aware of this consciously
Jack might just be a little JEALOUS when he says

JACK
Do you

KATE
Please

And as we can’t help but notice that wasn’t exactly a
denial

INT THE VALLEY - LOCKE’S AREA - DAY 10

LOCKE stands in front of his “cave cubby” weaving palm
fronds between bamboo poles to make a wall that will provide
him with some privacy from the others

SAYID (0S)
Locke

Locke turns to see Sayid approaching him a man on a mission

SAYID (CONTD)
Where were you last night
(off Locke’s look)
Last night Around sunset

Locke narrows his eyes at him getting the gist
LOCKE

Oh yes You were attacked Heard
about that
LOST Confidence Man (NETWORK DRAFT) 9804 14
10 (CONTD) 10

SAYID
And I heard you were in the jungle
Alone Not terribly far from where
it happened

Locke squints at him --

LOCKE
Well I’m afraid the only witness
to my whereabouts is the boar I was
skinning for our dinner

Sayid glares at the ground Locke studies him then

LOCKE (CONT’D)
You were attempting to boost the
signal on the transceiver Send
out a distress call

SAYID
More or less

LOCKE
So it would seem whoever attacked
you has reasons for not wanting to
get off the island
(pointedly)
Maybe someone who is profiting
from our current circumstances

Sayid eyes him for a long beat Understanding
SAYID

Is there someone you’re meaning in

particular

LOCKE

Oh you know who I’m meaning

(beat)

And from what I’ve seen you and

Mr Sawyer do share a certain

animosity

SAYID

He has an alibi Just before I
was struck he set off a
bottle rocket a signal we’d worked
out two kilometers away he
could not have had the time to --

LOST Confidence Man (NETWORK DRAFT) 9804 15
(CONTD) 10

LOCKE
Unless he’d found a way to time
delay the fuse on his rocket

Sayid looks at him --

SAYID
How could he possibly--

LOCKE
Anyone with basic military training
knows how to improvise a slow fuse
(then)
Use a cigarette

ee

As Sayid loses himself in this thought Locke reaches into
his gear pulls out a large KNIFE and holds it out to Sayid

LOCKE (CONT’D)
In case there’s a next time

Sayid stares at the knife then at Locke deciding it may not
be a bad idea to be prepared As Sayid takes the knife

EXT BEACH - CLEARING - DAY 11

An AXE slams down into a piece of WOOD splitting it in half

REVEAL SAWYER sweating as he tosses the pieces into a PILE
He reaches for another piece of DRIFTWOOD AS --

KATE (0S)
So what do you want

Sawyer glances to see KATE but just keeps on chopping

SAWYER
‘Scuse me

KATE
What do you want Sawyer

SAWYER
Freckles I got so many answers to
that question I wouldn’t even know
where to start

KATE
What do you want for the inhalers
LOST Confidence Man (NETWORK DRAFT) 9804 16
11 (CONTD) 11

SAWYER
Huh Good question Hang on a
tick What do I want

CRACK Splits another piece of wood Then turns to Kate

SAWYER (CONT’D)
A kiss ought to do it

KATE
What

SAWYER
A kiss From you Right now

Kate just stares He can’t possibly but he stares back
Yeah He’s serious Kate shakes her head ANGRY now --

KATE SAWYER
I don’t buy it
-- Buy what

KATE
The act You try too hard Sawyer
I ask you to help a sick woman and
you want me to kiss you No one
can be that disgusting

ON SAWYER getting pissed Why Because maybe Kate’s a
little close to the mark here And she’s not done --

KATE (CONT’D)
I’ve seen you y’know

SAWYER
Seen me what

KATE

With that piece of paper The one
you keep in your wallet I’ve seen
your face when you read it And
the way you fold it up so
carefully It means something to
you So play your games all you
want -- but I know there’s a human
being in there somewhere

(beat compassionate)
Give me the medication Please

And that just sits there for a few beats Just let it sink
in Did she actually get through to him Then
LOST Confidence Man (NETWORK DRAFT) 9804 17

(CONTD) 11
SAWYER
You think you understand me
KATE SAWYER
Yeah I think I --
-- Shut up
Kate recoils The pure VENOM in Sawyer -- not the playful

rogue we’re used to No This is serious
SAWYER (CONTD)
Wanna know what kind of human being
I am

And he reaches into his pocket Removes the ENVELOPE

SAWYER (CONT’D)
Read it

Kate takes a few steps back -- scared -- but he grabs her
wrist TIGHT Stuffs the letter into her other hand

SAWYER (CONT’D)
Read it

He lets go of her but doesn’t step back Let there be no

misunderstanding here -- Kate better fucking do what he says
So she unfolds the letter A beat Then
KATE
“Dear Mr Sawyer You don’t know
who I am But I know who you are
And I know what you done You

slept with my mother

(beat slower now)
And then you stole my dad’s money
all away So he got angry and he
killed my mother And then he
killed himself too”

SAWYER
Don’t stop now You’re gettin’ to
the good part

Kate looks at him Trying to process all this Not wanting
to continue but not really having a choice

LOST Confidence Man (NETWORK DRAFT) 9804
(CONTD) 11

KATE

“All I know is your name But one
of these days I am gonna find you
and I am going to give you this
letter so you’1l remember what you
done to me

(beat)
You killed my parents Mr Sawyer”

And that’s it Sawyer waits a moment Hoping Kate’s eyes
will come back up to meet his

but she can’t He reaches out snatches the letter and
gets in real close -- his voice part whisper part GROWL --

SAWYER
(more a vitriolic “fuck
you” than any real
request)
Now how ‘bout that kiss

But of course Kate is just frozen -- stunned -- and so after
a long beat

SAWYER (CONTD)
LT didn’t think so

And Sawyer turns and walks away But we’re settling into an
ECU OF KATE -- stricken

And as her eyes finally come up to him go
CUT TO BLACK

ACT TWO
INT THE VALLEY - OUTSIDE THE INFIRMARY CAVE - NIGHT 12

The IMPACTFUL SOUND OF DRY WHEEZING BRINGS US INTO -

CU on MARYBETH On a blanket against the outside of the
INFIRMARY CAVE Jack tends to her Richard looks on

JACK
You need to try to relax
(beat)
How often do you get these attacks
MARYBETH
At home maybe once a week
RICHARD

She’s been getting them almost
every day since the crash

Marybeth is suddenly struck by a COUGHING FIT Jack helps
her sit up The coughing calms replaced by a DRY WHEEZE --

JACK
Marybeth Just hang in there
okay I’1l get you through this

-- and OFF JACK his eyes betraying his words

ANGLE ON SUN - ACROSS THE VALLEY 13

We find SUN watching She then crosses to JIN filling up a
bottle of water at the SPRING She speaks to him in Korean

SUN
That woman Shes very ill

JIN
The doctor is taking care of her

SUN
I think I can help her

JIN
Leave it to the doctor This is
not our problem

SUN JIN

But--
-- Let it go

And OFF SUN not willing to let it go at all

LOST Confidence Man (NETWORK DRAFT) 9804

RESUME ON JACK 14

Going through his MEDS Looking for anything that could help
-- and then he senses something -- even before he sees it --
Jack looks across the valley to find

SAWYER Striding in like he owns the place he crosses to
the STREAM to refill his bottles

Jack is BUMBLEFUCKED he can’t believe this guy

-but that quickly wears off Playtime’s over Jack moves
STRAIGHT TOWARD SAWYER Sawyer sees him coming Rises to
meet the welcome party as --

JACK

What are you doing here
SAWYER

Getting water That a problem
JACK

Give me the inhalers Now
SAWYER

Hell -- I was wonderin’ when you

were gonna stop asking nice

Sawyer SMILES raises the bottle to his mouth -- and Jack’s
fist moves so fucking fast we barely register it -- WHAM

Sawyer stumbles back -- hand goes to his BUSTED LIP Looks
at his own blood Then back up to Jack --

SAWYER (CONT’D)
Well it’s about time cowboy
Didn’t think you had it in

WHAM Jack POUNDS HIM again Sawyer’s head whips around
drops to ONE KNEE

And by now some of the OTHERS have gathered around Notably
SAYID and RICHARD Sawyer looks up revels in the attention--

SAWYER (CONTD)
Whoo That’s it I’ve been
telling you since day one that
were in the wild

And Jack draws his fist back to give him some more but
it’s CLEAR that Sawyer has no intention of fighting back
He’s just WAITING FOR IT

LOST Confidence Man (NETWORK DRAFT) 9804 21

(CONTD) 14

And maybe it’s his awareness that the others are watching
him or maybe it’s the fact that Sawyer is just begging for

it -- that he wants Jack to hit him again --
But Jack lowers his fist Not calm but CONTROLLING it --
And knowing that if he lets this go any further he won’t be
able to STOP

So with an almost inhuman display of self-control Jack
STRIDES OFF --

-- and as we settle CLOSE ON SAWYER his eyes flickering with
the defeat of a man whose bait has not been taken

The money comes from -- what
INT NEW ORLEANS DINER - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 16
A dive -- a place for shady deals Jessica sits beside DAVID her good-looking husband David leafs through a thick
PROSPECTUS on the oil-drilling operation

SAWYER looks up from across their shared booth He’s sharp
Suit designer glasses this guy cleans up good -- and it’s
clear that David likes Sawyer wants to believe him

SAWYER
Incentives from a foreign
investment Listen -- David I’m

not sure this is a good idea--

JESSICA
Why not

SAWYER
‘Cause business between friends is
always a little sticky
(to David)
I don’t know you well but I know
your wife Working with her at the
bank I’m not sure I’m comfortable--

DAVID
(back to the Prospectus)
-- Louisiana will invest two-thirds
of the drilling cost What is
this a loophole

JESSICA

Sawyer watches David pondering -- until Sawyer unexpectedly
gets up grabs his briefcase and slaps down a twenty for
their food

Listen Don’t worry I got other
investors lined up --

JESSICA

SAWYER

shaky It’s like she’s convulsing

pail that held the water

Jack and Sawyer stare at each other then

CLOSE as Sayid kneels down beside Sawyer just behind him
close enough to speak into his ear Begins to strip CHUTES
from the bamboo --

SAYID
We do not have bamboo in Iraq
though we have something similar
Reeds But their effect is the
same when the chutes are inserted
under the fingernails

Sawyer turns his head a bit to face Sayid --
SAWYER
Know what I think Ali I think
youve never actually tortured
anybody in your life
Sayid takes that in then

HE GRABS Sawyer’s hand on the other side of the tree BENDS

ON SAWYER chuckling despite himself

SAYID
Unfortunately for us both you’re
wrong

And this all happens mercifully BELOW FRAME as --

Sayid JAMS A CHUTE under one of Sawyer’s fingernails Sawyer
GRUNTS -- let’s out a sharp hiss of PAIN

Man you’re just a big

But Sayid is moving the knife even CLOSER MACRO-CLOSE And
he’s actually gonna fucking do it --

Okay Okay you win

Sayid holds the knife steady --

(CONTD) 26

KILEY (late 40’s) - a bull-necked JT Walsh type in rolled
up shirtsleeves and a tie - knocking pool balls into their
pockets without looking away from Sawyer

KILEY
‘Cause when a man walks into my
place and tells me he left a
hundred and sixty thousand of my
hard-won dollars in the care of a
civilian I gotta ask myself if
what I’m hearing isn’t a desperate
cry for the sweet release of death

Kiley sinks the second to last ball on the table then with
a FLICK of his wrist has his cue against Sawyer’s throat

SAWYER
That’s why you’re an accountant and
I’m a genius Mr Kiley

Sawyer’s smirk remains firmly planted on his face as he
Maneuvers his Zippo around the cue to light a cigarette --

SAWYER (CONTD)

I closed a deal today Big one

(off Kiley’s look)
See women are easy A few cosmos
and a couple of stunts they haven’t
seen between the sheets and they
think the scam is their idea The
husbands -

Sawyer sticks up his index finger uses it to move the cue
away as he speaks

SAWYER (CONTD)
- They need to touch the money
Smell it Believe that if they had
the brass to put that suitcase in
the trunk of their Ford Taurus and
speed away they might just have a
chance at being an honest-to-gosh
outlaw They need the rock-hard
conviction that I handed them the
chance to screw me

for Where’s your seed from the
last couple you roped

SAWYER
What can I say I like earning it
as much as I like spending it

KILEY
(laughing)
No Sawyer -- That’s not why

And Kiley’s laughter abruptly stops as he bores into Sawyer
with a stare so intense it could freeze vodka

KILEY (CONTD)
The reason you can’t hold on to
money is you aren’t in it for
money You’re in it to make people
suffer and in this “accountant’s”
mind that makes you a liability

And for the first time Sawyer’s grin falters Kiley just
nailed him A beat Then --

SAWYER
You got your baggage I got mine

KILEY
Be that as it may I know a thing
or two about making people suffer

behind the tree His eyes come up full of VENOM for Jack
But what Jack offers in return is CURIOSITY --

JACK
What’s your problem Sawyer

And that just hangs there for a few moments And we’re
anticipating Sawyer’s response when -- NOISE from the
surrounding jungle Jack turns to see --

SAYID returning Behind him KATE And as soon as she sees

Sawyer tied up like an animal -- no matter what she thinks of
the guy -- There’s a flash of VULNERABILITY

Okay She’s here Now tell us

And as Jack and Sayid (grudgingly so) walk off into the
jungle CAMERA DROPS DOWN on the OTHER SIDE OF THE TREE to
find --

SAWYER twisting his wrists around inside the bungee rope
binding them -- starting to working himself free

Kate oblivious to this as she approaches him Matter-of-fact
tone undercut by concern --

KATE

So I’m here Where is it

tortured by a damn spinal surgeon
and a genuine I-raqi

‘Course I’m serious

Kate just looks at him Not knowing quite WHAT to think

SAWYER (CONTD)

Youre not seeing the big picture
here Freckles You really gonna
let that woman suffocate ‘cause you
can’t bring yourself to give me a
little kiss Hell -- it’s only
first base lucky for you I ain’t
greedy I’m making it real simple
here -- you wanna be a hero or not

ON KATE Yeah It’s fucking ridiculous But dammit if he
doesn’t make a compelling argument And dammit if there
isn’t a strong contingent of women out there watching this
show who WANT her to do it

And we can see the moment in which she makes up her mind

KATE
Okay

SAWYER
Okay

Kate approaches him Squats down on her haunches Gets
close Looks into his eyes He looks back

And her is the first kiss on LOST

What makes it interesting is that even though it starts out
as a chore -- a necessity -- somewhere about three or four

seconds in it becomes something ELSE And just before it

actually goes from something else to REAL

Kate pulls away

And we milk this delicious moment afterward for all it’s
worth And despite the insanity of the circumstances under
which it happened both of them felt something Finally --
andwhen Sawyer talks to her now it’s softer -- that kiss
did something to him -- some of his swagger is gone -- he’s

just aman now --

the hilt and --

PULLS THE KNIFE RIGHT OUT

Sawyer CRIS OUT IN PAIN - clenches down his teeth as Jack
sticks his hand into the wound - trying to find the artery as
Sawyer reflexively SQUIRMS --

JACK
Stay still dammit

Sawyer’s fist clench around the earth - his fingernails
digging into the ground as Jack does his grim duty -- SHIT --
Jack’s hand -- already SOAKED with Sawyer’s blood

DAVID
Excuse me

SAWYER
Deal’s off Forget it

He reaches for his briefcase Jessica distressed -- this
wasn’t part of the plan --

JESSICA DAVID
What are you doing -- Hold on -- You’re not

walking out of here man

SAWYER (CONTD)
I’m calling it off Walking away
No harm no foul

And this isn’t making any sense -- why is he bailing Why

the sudden change of heart But Sawyer has his briefcase

now ready to head for the door when -- Davids hand clamps

down on his WRIST

DAVID
Jessica call the police

SAWYER
Take your hand off me boy

And Sawyer would DECK this fucking guy but again his
attention is drawn to THE BOY

DAVID

Jessica not knowing what to do Betrayed Confused --

BOY
Mommy

And Sawyer is still looking at the kid And we are EXTREMELY
CLOSE ON HIM Close enough to see him make the decision

Sawyer LETS GO OF THE BRIEFCASE Pushes David back --
SAWYER

Keep the money

And Sawyer walks right out of the living room and into --
INT JESSICA and DAVID’S FOYER - CONTINUOUS - FLASHBACK 34

TIGHT ON SAWYER striding for the front door Blank look in
his eyes Pulling open the FRONT DOOR David and Jessica in
the bg doorway SHOUTING their words muted because were

IN SAWYER’S HEAD -- CLOSING ON HIS EYES

And as we wonder what could possibly have happened to make
him leave HIS money behind guaranteeing certain PUNISHMENT

Sawyer BLINKS bringing us into --

INT SAWYER’S TENT - LATE AFTERNOON 35
Sawyer’s eyes FLUTTER OPEN Groggy And the first thing he
feels is PAIN Looks down at his ARM THICK BANDAGE AROUND

IT Tries to move it -- WINCES as we --

WIDEN to find him propped up in his makeshift BED back in
his TENT on the beach And he’s not alone --

KATE
You’re lucky to be alive

Find Kate literally sitting by his “bedside” We should

note something about Sawyer here -- He is real
SAWYER
The doctor --
KATE
Ignored you and saved your life
anyway
SAWYER

Where is he

LOST Confidence Man (NETWORK DRAFT) 9804 48
(CONTD) 35

KATE
He headed back to the caves to
check on that woman

And that’s when Sawyer notices Kate’s holding something An
ENVELOPE His letter And she SEES him notice it --

KATE (CONTD)
I read it again And then again
Last couple hours -- I don’t know
how many times

Sawyer a little vulnerable here A little guarded --

SAWYER
Why would you --

KATE

(simple straight)
Because I’m trying to figure out
why you made me read it

(beat)
Why you beat up that man instead of
just telling him you didn’t have
his wife’s medication Why you
pretended to have it anyway

(beat)
Why you let yourself get tortured

(beat)
And the thing I kept coming up with
was -- it was that you want to be
hated And maybe that’s why you
made me read this letter

(opens it up reads)
You killed my parents Mr
Sawyer”

e

And now Kate SIGHS Almost like she SHES IT Then --

KATE (CONTD)
And then I looked at the envelope

Kate turns over the envelope and we see A COMMEMORATIVE
EMBOSSED SEAL ON SAWYER feeling totally NAKED

KATE (CONTD)
“America’s Bicentennial --
Knoxville Tennessee 1976”

We let that sink in for a second Then --

LOST Confidence Man (NETWORK DRAFT) 9804
(CONTD) 35

KATE (CONTD)
You were a kid in 1976
(then)
Eight maybe nine years old

SAWYER
-- Kate

KATE
This letter wasn’t written to you
(long beat)
You wrote this letter

Sawyer’s eyes DROP -- holding them in a real TIGHT TWO-SHOT --
the pure INTIMACY of the moment impossible to avoid --

KATE (CONTD)
Sawyer isn’t your name is it

And a LONG beat passes before --

SAWYER
(quietly)
It was his name

And he starts speaking slowly at first in his own head

SAWYER (CONTD)

First heard it at my momma’s wake
My daddy didn’t get one -- You
don’t get a wake when you kill
yourself

(then)
Was my Uncle Doug who pulled me
aside Told me it was a confidence
man who killed them Told me how
he rolled into town marked my
folks Romanced my momma used her
to get to their money Wiped ‘em
out clean left the mess behind
Only thing the cops had was his
name on a bogus business card

(beat)
So I wrote that letter Wrote it
knowing I’d find him one day

(then)
You want all the sad parts ‘Cause
I spent the next ten years getting
passed off from one place to
another Lady from the State wrote
me off -- “adjustment problems”
Don’t that just say it all

CAMERA STARTING TO PUSH IN on him now as he tells this story
A story he has probably never told out loud --

SAWYER (CONTD)

And then I was nineteen -- needed
six grand to pay off some guys I
was in trouble with So I found a
pretty lady with a dumb husband who
had some money

(owning it)
And I got them to give it to me

(shakes his head

chuckles)
How you like that for tragedy
Became the man I was hunting

(a long beat then)
Became Sawyer

ee

And finally he’s done LOOKS to Kate --

And she is empathetic Vulnerable Something about this guy
is so wounded so HURT she can identify with it It is an
intense moment because it is so TRUE

But Sawyer quickly becomes self-aware -- doesn’t like the way
she’s looking at him And as RAW as he just was it only
takes a second for him to transform back into a WILD ANIMAL --

SAWYER (CONTD)
Don’t you feel sorry for me

KATE SAWYER
What I
-- Get the hell out
Sawyer PULLS the letter from her hand Kate surprised --

SAWYER (CONTD)
Get out

And Kate’s eyes narrow Can’t believe she almost actually
just cried for this fucker And now her own walls going up
she stands Looks down at him for a moment

But there’s nothing left to say So she goes

Once she’s gone SETTLE ON SAWYER Watching her walk away
Clutching that letter

the day - when a shadow falls upon her She turns to see -

- SAYID walking over head downcast a bag slung over his
shoulder loaded with supplies

have no right to be here

But there’s nowhere to go

SAYID

Someone has to walk the shore Map
the island See what else there
is Find a means of escape

(beat)

I can’t think of a better person to
do it then the only one I trust

Kate looks at Sayid - she

knows better than to try to talk

him out of it so she merely nods -

- and Sayid returns the nod

SAYID

(CONTD)

I hope we meed again Under
happier circumstances

And with that he’s gone
a deep breath and that’s

Kate turns back to the beach takes
how long it takes for her to

realize that a tear is draqging down her cheek

Off the moment as Sayid moves farther and farther away down

the beach
