Rachel

NATASCHA
(Russian accent)
Hello
DENT

The famous Bruce Wayne Rachels
told me everything about you

WAYNE
I certainly hope not

RACHEL
Bruce this is Harvey Dent

WAYNE
Lets put a couple tables together

DENT
I dont know if theyll let us-

WAYNE
They should I own the place

OK

DENT

Is Wayne Manor in the city limits
Rachel gives Dent a withering look

WAYNE
The Palisades Sure You know as
our new DA you might want to
figure out where your jurisdiction
ends

NATASCHA
Im talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante

DENT
Gothams proud of an ordinary man
standing up for whats right

NATASCHA
Gotham needs heroes like you-
elected officials not a man who
thinks hes above the law

WAYNE
Exactly Who appointed the Batman

DENT
We did All of us who stood by and
let scum take control of our city
Wayne watches Dent Sees his passion

NATASCHA
But this is a democracy Harvey

DENT
When their enemies were at the
gate the Romans would suspend
democracy and appoint one man to
protect the city It wasnt
considered an honor It was
considered public service

RACHEL
And the last man they asked to
protect the republic was named
Caesar He never gave up that
power

DENT
Well I guess you either die a hero
or you live long enough to see
yourself become the villain Look
whoever the Batman is he doesn’t
want to spend the rest of his life
doing this How could he Batmans
looking for someone to take up his
mantle

NATASCHA
Someone like you MrDent

DENT
Maybe If Im up to it

Natascha reaches up and covers the top half of Dents face

to take care of the problem so we
started looking for the stones
But after six months we couldnt
find anyone who had traded with
hin

One day I found a child playing
with a ruby as big as a tangerine

The bandit had been throwing the
stones away

So why was he stealing them

Because he thought it was good
