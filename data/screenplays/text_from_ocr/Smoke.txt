1 EXT DAY ELEVATED SUBWAY TRAIN

Against the backdrop of the Manhattan skyline we see an elevated
subway train heading toward Brooklyn

After a moment we begin to hear voices An animated discussion is
taking place inside the Brooklyn Cigar Company

2 INT DAY THE BROOKLYN CIGAR CO

The cigar shop from within Displays of cigar boxes a wall of
magazines piles of newspapers cigarettes smoking paraphernalia
On

the walls we see framed black-and-white photographs of people
smoking
cigars Groucho Marx George Burns Clint Eastwood Edward G
Robinson
Orson Welles Charles Laughton Frankensteins monster Leslie
Caron

Ernie Kovacs

Words appear on the screen SUMMER 1990

AUGGIE WREN is behind the counter Somewhere between forty and
fifty

years old AUGGIE is a scruffy presence unkempt hair a two-day
stubble of beard dressed in blue jeans and a black T-shirt We see
an

intricate tattoo on one arm

It is a slow hour AUGGIE is flipping through a photography
magazine

Near the counter are the three OTB MEN These are local characters
who

like to hang out in the store shooting the breeze with AUGGIE One
is

black (TOMMY) and the other two are white (JERRY and DENNIS)
DENNIS

wears a T-shirt with the following words printed across the front
Tf

life is a dream what happens when I wake up

TOMMY
Ill tell you why theyre not going anywhere

JERRY
Yeah And why is that
The bells on the door jangle as someone enters

TOMMY
Management Those guys are walking around with
their heads up their asses

DENNIS
They made some great deals Tommy Hernandez
Carter Without those two there never woulda
been no World Series

TOMMY
That was four years ago Im talking about now
(Growing more intense)
Look who they got rid of Mitchell Backman
McDowell Dykstra Aguillera Mookie Mookie
Wilson for Chrissakes
(Shakes his head)

JERRY
(Sarcastically)
And Nolan Ryan Dont forget him

DENNIS
(Chiming in)
Yeah And Amos Otis

TOMMY
(Shrugs)
Okay joke about it I dont give a shit

JERRY
Jesus Tommy it aint science you know You

Thats how it works

TOMMY
They didnt have to do a thing thats all Im
saying The team was good the best fucking
team in baseball But then they had to screw it
up
(Pause)
They traded their birthright for a mess of
porridge

(Shakes his head)
A mess of porridge

protg

JIMMY ROSE

been

a mentally retarded man in his late twenties

It is AUGGIES

He has
sweeping the sidewalk outside the store and holds a broom in his
right
hand

AUGGIE
Howd you do out there Jimmy

JIMMY
Good Auggie Real good

(Proudly thrusts out broom)
All finished

AUGGIE
(Philosophically)
Itll never be finished

JIMMY
(Confused)
Huh

AUGGIE
Thats how it is with sidewalks People come
people go and they all drop shit on the
ground As soon as you clean up one spot and
move on to the next the first spot is dirty
again

JIMMY

(Trying to digest AUGGIES comment)
I just do what you tell me Auggie You tell me
to sweep so I sweep

The bells on the door jangle again and a customer enters the
store a

middle-class man in his early thirties He walks to the counter as
JERRY teases JIMMY In the background we see him talking to
AUGGIE

AUGGIE pulls some cigar boxes out of the display case and puts them
on

the counter for the YOUNG MAN to inspect In the foreground we see

JERRY
(Interrupting Playfully)
Hey Jimmy You got the time

JIMMY

(Turning to the SECOND OTB MAN)
Huh
JERRY
You still have that watch Auggie gave you

JIMMY

(Holds up left wrist showing

cheap digital watch Smiles)
Tick-tock tick-tock

JERRY
So whats the time

JIMMY

(Studying watch)
Twelve-eleven

(Pause marveling as

the numbers change)
Twelve-twelve

(Looks up smiling)
Twelve-twelve

A sudden outburst is heard from the area near the counter

YOUNG MAN
(Aghast)
Ninety-two dollars

The focus of the scene shifts to AUGGIE and the YOUNG MAN

AUGGIE

They dont come cheap son These little honeys
are works of art Rolled by hand in a tropical
climate most likely by an eighteen year old
girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear
on Little beads of sweat forming in her naked
cleavage The smooth delicate fingers nimbly
turning out one masterpiece after another

YOUNG MAN
(Pointing)
And how much are these

AUGGIE

Seventy-eight dollars The girl who rolled these
was probably wearing panties

YOUNG MAN
(Pointing)
And these
AUGGIE
Fifty-six That girl had on a corset

YOUNG MAN
(Pointing)
And these

AUGGIE
Forty-four Theyre on special this week from
the Canary Islands A real bargain

YOUNG MAN

I think Ill take them
(Takes wallet from his pocket
and counts out 50 which he

hands to AUGGIE)

AUGGIE
A good choice You wouldnt want to celebrate
he birth of your firstborn with a box of
tinkers would you Remember to keep them in
he refrigerator until you hand them out

ato ct

YOUNG MAN
he refrigerator

H

AUGGIE
Itll keep them fresh If they get too dry
theyll break And you dont want that to
happen do you

(Putting cigar box into a bag

ringing up sale on the cash register)
Tobacco is a plant and it needs the same
loving care youd give an orchid

YOUNG MAN
Thanks for the tip

AUGGIE
Any time And congratulations to you and your
wife Just remember though in the immortal
words of Rudyard Kipling A woman is just a
woman but a cigar is a smoke

YOUNG MAN
(Confused)

What does that mean

AUGGIE
Damned if I know But it has a nice ring to it
dont it

At that moment we hear the bells on the door jangle again Cut to
the

door Another customer enters the store PAUL BENJAMIN He is in
his

early forties dressed in rumpled casual clothes As he approaches
the

counter the YOUNG MAN brushes past him and leaves the store The
OTB

MEN and JIMMY look on as PAUL and AUGGIE talk

PAUL
Hey Auggie Hows it going

AUGGIE
Hey man Good to see you Whatll it be today

PAUL
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks And throw ina
lighter while youre at it

AUGGIE
(Reaching for cigars and lighter)
The boys and I were just having a philosophical
discussion about women and cigars Some
interesting connections there dont you think

PAUL
(Laughs)
Definitely
(Pause)
I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth

AUGGIE
The Queen of England

PAUL

Not Elizabeth the Second Elizabeth the First
(Pause)

Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh

TOMMY
Sure Hes the guy who threw his cloak down
over the puddle

JERRY
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes They came
with a free gift coupon in every pack

PAUL
Thats the man Well Raleigh was the person
who introduced tobacco in England and since he
was a favorite of the Queens -- Queen Bess he
used to call her -- smoking caught on as a
fashion at court Im sure Old Bess must have
shared a stogie or two with Sir Walter Once
he made a bet with her that he could measure
the weight of smoke

DENNIS
You mean weigh smoke

PAUL
Exactly Weigh smoke

TOMMY
You cant do that Its like weighing air

PAUL
I admit its strange Almost like weighing
someones soul But Sir Walter was a clever
guy First he took an unsmoked cigar and put
it on a balance and weighed it Then he lit up
and smoked the cigar carefully tapping the
ashes into the balance pan When he was
finished he put the butt into the pan along
with the ashes and weighed what was there
Then he subtracted that number from the
original weight of the unsmoked cigar The
difference was the weight of the smoke

TOMMY
Not bad Thats the kind of guy we need to take
over the Mets

PAUL
Oh he was smart all right But not so smart
that he didnt wind up having his head chopped
off twenty years later

(Pause)
But thats another story

AUGGIE
(Handing PAUL his change and putting
cigar tins and lighter in a paper bag)
Seven eighty-five out of twenty
(As PAUL turns to leave)
Take care of yourself now and dont do
anything I wouldnt do

PAUL

(Smiling)
I wouldnt think of it

(Waves casually to the OTB MEN)
See you around fellas

AUGGIE and the OTB MEN watch as PAUL leaves the store
TOMMY
(Turning to AUGGIE)

What is he some kind of wise guy

AUGGIE
Nah Hes a good kid

JERRY
Ive seen him around He comes in here a lot
dont he

AUGGIE

Couple of times a week maybe Hes a writer
Lives in the neighborhood

TOMMY
And what kind of writer is he An underwriter

AUGGIE

(Peeved)
Very funny Some of the cracks you make Tommy
sometimes I think you should see a doctor You
know go in for some wit therapy or something
To clean out the valves in your brain

TOMMY
(A little embarrassed Shrugs)
It was just a joke

AUGGIE
The guys a novelist Paul Benjamin You ever
hear of him

(Pause)
Thats a stupid question The only things you
guys read is the Racing Form and pages of the
Post

(Pause)
Hes published three or four books But
nothing now for the past few years

DENNIS
Whats the matter He run out of ideas

AUGGIE
He ran out of luck

(Pause)
Remember that holdup out here on Seventh Avenue
few years back

JERRY
You talking about the bank The time those two
guys started spraying bullets all over the
street

AUGGIE
Thats it Four people got killed One of them
was Pauls wife
(Pause)
The poor lug he hasnt been the same since
(Pause)
he funny thing was she stopped in here just
efore it happened To stock up on cigars for
im She was a nice lady Ellen Four or five
onths pregnant at the time which means that
hen she was killed the baby was killed too

3 Z OH

TOMMY
Bad day at Black Rock eh Auggie

Close-up of AUGGIES face Remembering

AUGGIE
It was bad all right I sometimes think that
if she hadnt given me exact change that day
or if the store had been a little more crowded
it would have taken her a few more seconds to
get out of here and then maybe she wouldnt
have stepped in front of that bullet Shed
still be alive the baby would have been born
and Paul would be sitting at home writing
another book instead of wandering the streets
with a hangover

(Pensive his expression suddenly

turns to one of alarm)
Cut to white youth in the corner of the store shoving paperback
books
into the pockets of his tattered army fatigue jacket

AUGGIE (contd)
Hey What are you doing there kid Hey cut
that out

AUGGIE scrambles out from behind the counter pushing his way past
the
OTB MEN as the kid takes off and runs out of the store

3 EXT DAY SEVENTH AVENUE

AUGGIE chases the BOOK THIEF down the street Eventually he gets
winded and gives up He pauses for a moment to catch his breath
then

turns around and heads back in the direction of the store

4 INT DAY PAULS APARTMENT A BROWNSTONE BUILDING IN PARK
SLOPE
THIRD FLOOR)

Shot of a little brown cigar burning in an ashtray

The camera pulls back to reveal PAUL at his desk He is writing in
longhand using a pad of yellow legal paper An old Smith-Corona
typewriter is also on the desk poised for work with a half-written
page in the roller Off in the corner we see a neglected word
processor

The workroom is a bare and simple place Desk chair and a small
wooden bookcase with manuscripts and papers shoved onto its
shelves

The window faces a brick wall

As PAUL continues to write the camera travels from the workroom
into
the larger of the two rooms that make up his apartment

This larger room is an all-purpose space that includes a sleeping
area

a kitchenette in one corner a dining table and a large easy chair
Crowded bookshelves occupy one wall from floor to ceiling The bow
windows face front looking down onto the street Near the bed we
see

a framed photograph of a young woman (This is Ellen Pauls dead
wife)
The camera travels back into the workroom We see PAUL at work
Fade
out

Fade in We see PAUL at his desk eating a TV dinner while still
writing in the pad After a moment he inadvertently knocks the
food

off the desk with his elbow He begins to bend over to pick up the
food but as he does so a new idea suddenly occurs to him Instead
of

cleaning up the mess he turns back to his pad and continues
writing

5 EXT DAY IN FRONT OF THE BROOKLYN CIGAR CO

We see PAUL walking out of the cigar store JIMMY ROSE is on the
corner observing him throughout the scene PAUL takes three or
four

steps then realizes he has forgotten something He goes back into
the
store During his brief absence JIMMY remains on the corner
imitating

PAULS gestures patting in pockets looking puzzled realizing
that he

has forgotten the cigars he just bought

PAUL comes out again a moment later holding a tin of
Schimmelpenninck

cigars He pauses takes a cigar out of the tin and lights up He
continues walking obviously distracted He stops briefly at a
corner

then steps out into the street paying no attention to the traffic
A
speeding tow truck is rushing toward the intersection At the last
second a black hand reaches out grabs PAUL by the arm and pulls
him
back to the curb If not for that timely move PAUL would surely
have

been run down

We see PAULS rescuer it is RASHID COLE a black adolescent of
sixteen

or seventeen He is tall and well built for his age A nylon
backpack

is slung over his left shoulder

RASHID
Watch out man Youll get yourself killed like
that
PAUL

(Badly shaken still

clinging to RASHIDS arm)
I cant believe I did that Christ Im
walking around in a fog

RASHID
No harm done Everythings okay now
(Looks down and notices that he and
PAUL are still gripping each others
arms Tries to pull away)
Ive got to be going

PAUL
(Still rattled Begins to loosen grip
then grabs hold of RASHIDS again)
No wait You cant just walk off
(Pause)
You saved my life

RASHID

(Shrugs)
I just happened to be there The right place
at the right time

PAUL
(Relaxes grip on RASHIDS arm)
I owe you something

RASHID
Its okay mister No big deal

PAUL
Yes it is Its a law of the universe If I let
you walk away the moon will spin out of orbit
pestilence will reign over the city for a
hundred years

RASHID
(Mystified amused Smiles faintly)
Well if you put it that way

PAUL
You have to let me do something for you to put
the scales in balance

RASHID
(Thinks shakes his head)
Thats all right If I think of something Ill
send my butler over to tell you

PAUL
Come on At least let me buy you a cup of
coffee

RASHID
I dont drink coffee

(Smiles)
On the other hand since you insist if you
offered me a cold lemonade I wouldnt say no

PAUL
Good Lemonade it is

(Pause Extends right hand)
Im Paul

RASHID
Rashid Rashid Cole
(Shakes PAULS hand)

Cut to
6 INT DAY GREEK DINER IN PARK SLOPE

PAUL and RASHID are sitting in a booth The restaurant is nearly
empty
We see RASHID finishing his second lemonade

PAUL

(Watching RASHID drink)
Are you sure you dont want some food to go
along with it It might help to absorb some of
that liquid You dont want to slosh around
too much when you stand up

RASHID
Thats okay Ive already had lunch

PAUL

(Looks at clock on wall)
You must eat lunch pretty early Its only
eleven oclock

RASHID
I mean breakfast

PAUL
(Studying RASHID closely)
Yeah sure and I bet you had lobster last
night Along with two bottles of champagne

RASHID
Just one bottle I believe in moderation

PAUL
Look kid its okay with me You dont have to
play games If you want a hamburger or
something go ahead and order it

RASHID
(Hesitates)
Well maybe just one To be polite

PAUL

(Turning to WAITRESS She comes)
Cocktail hour is over The young man would
like to order a hamburger

WAITRESS
(To RASHID)
How do you want that cooked

RASHID
Medium rare please

WAITRESS
Fries

RASHID
(Looks at PAUL PAUL nods)
Yes please

WAITRESS
Lettuce and tomato

RASHID
(Looks at PAUL PAUL nods)

lemonade glass)
You want another one of these too

PAUL
Yeah give him another one And Ill take a cup
of coffee while youre at it

WAITRESS
Hot coffee or iced coffee

PAUL
Do you have real iced coffee or do you just
pour hot coffee over some ice cubes

WAITRESS

Everything is real in here honey
(Pause)

As real as the color of my hair

PAUL and RASHID look at her hair It is dyed bright red

PAUL
(Deadpan)

Ill take the iced coffee
(Pause)

You only live once right

WAITRESS
(Equally deadpan)
If youre lucky
(Pause)
Then again it depends on what you call living
(She walks off)

PAUL

(To RASHID)
I dont mean to pry but I see a kid walking
around with a big knapsack on his back and I
begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions
arent stowed in there Are you in some kind of
trouble or what

RASHID
(Keeping up his pose)
Mostly what

PAUL

(Studying RASHID)
You dont have to tell me if you dont want to
but I might be able to help

RASHID
(Hesitating)
You dont know me from a hole in the wall
PAUL
Thats true But I also owe you something and
Im not sure that buying you a hamburger is
going to do the job
(Pause)
What is it Family problems Money problems

RASHID
(Imitating white upper-class accent)
Oh no Momsie and Popsie have oodles

PAUL
And where do Momsie and Popsie live

RASHID
East Seventy-fourth Street

PAUL
In Manhattan

RASHID
Of course Where else

PAUL
Then what are you doing in Park Slope Its a
little far from home isnt it

RASHID
(Beginning to relent)
Thats where the what comes in

PAUL
The what

RASHID

The what
(Pause)

Ive kind of run away from home you see
(Pause)

It has nothing to do with my parents or money
I saw something I wasnt supposed to see and
for the time being its best that I keep myself
out of sight

PAUL
You cant be more specific than that

RASHID looks at PAUL hesitates then lowers his eyes
PAUL (contd)
(Pause Decides not to press him)
So where have you been staying in the meantime

RASHID
Here and there Around

PAUL
Uh-huh One of those cozy bed and breakfast
places probably

RASHID
Yeah thats right

PAUL
Except that theres no bed is there And no
breakfast either

RASHID
The material world is an illusion It doesnt
matter if theyre there or not The world is in
my head

PAUL
But your body is in the world isnt it
(Pause)
If someone offered you a place to stay you
wouldnt necessarily refuse would you

RASHID

(Pause Thinks)
People dont do that kind of thing Not in New
York

PAUL
Im not people Im just me And I do
whatever I goddamn want to do Got it

RASHID
Thanks but Ill manage

PAUL
In case youre wondering I like women not
little boys And Im not offering you a
long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a
couple of nights

RASHID
I can take care of myself Dont worry

PAUL
Suit yourself But if you change your mind
heres the address
(Takes out a pad from his pocket and
scribbles down the address Tears
sheet from the pad and hands it to
RASHID)

The WAITRESS arrives with their orders

WAITRESS
One burger medium rare with lettuce and tomato
(Setting down plate in front of RASHID)
One order of fries
(Setting down plate)
One lemonade
(Setting down glass)
And one dose of reality
(Setting down iced coffee
in front of PAUL)

PAUL looks on as RASHID picks up hamburger and takes his first
bite

7 INT DAY THE BROOKLYN CIGAR CO

A slow hour AUGGIE is sitting behind the counter looking through
a

magazine and eating a slice of pizza for lunch VINNIE enters the
frame He is the owner of the store a large man in his fifties

VINNIE
Okay I think everythings set

(Lights up cigar)
Youve got the number for Cape Cod right Just
in case something goes wrong

AUGGIE
(Chewing pizza not looking
up from magazine)
No problem Vinnie Everythings under control
(Finally looking up)
I could run this store in my sleep

VINNIE
(Studying AUGGIE)
How long you been working for me Auggie
AUGGIE

(Shrugs looks down at magazine again)
I dont know Thirteen fourteen years
Something like that

VINNIE
Its pretty crazy dont you think I mean a
smart guy like you What do you want to hang
on to a dead-end job like this for

AUGGIE
(Shrugs again)
I dont know
(Turns pages of magazine)
Maybe because I love you so much boss

VINNIE
Shit You should have been married to someone
by now You know settled down somewhere with a
kid or two a nice steady job

AUGGIE
I almost got married once

VINNIE
Yeah I know To that girl who moved to
Pittsburgh

AUGGIE
Ruby McNutt My one true love

VINNIE
Sounds like another one of your stories to me

AUGGIE
(Shakes his head)
She upped and married some other cat after I
joined the navy By the time I got my
discharge though she was divorced Her
husband poked out her eye in a domestic
quarrel

VINNIE
(Puffing on his cigar)
Lovely

AUGGIE
(Remembering)
She made a play for me after I got back but
her glass eye kept interfering with my
concentration Every time we got into a clinch
Id start thinking about that hole in her head
that empty socket with the glass eye in it An
eye that couldnt see an eye that couldnt
shed any tears The minute I started thinking
about it Mr Johnson would get all soft and
small And I cant see getting married if Mr
Johnson isnt going to be in tiptop shape

VINNIE
(Shaking his head)
You dont take anything seriously do you

AUGGIE

I try not to anyway Its better for your
health I mean look at you Vincent Youre
the guy with the wife and three kids and the
ranch house on Long Island Youre the guy with
the white shoes and the white Caddy and the
white shag carpet But youve had two heart
attacks and Im still waiting for my first

VINNIE
(Takes cigar out of his mouth
and looks at it with disgust)
I should stop smoking these damn things is what
I should do The fuckers are going to kill me
one day

AUGGIE
Enjoy it while you can Vin Pretty soon
theyre going to legislate us out of business
anyway

VINNIE
They catch you smoking tobacco theyll stand
you up against a wall and shoot you

AUGGIE

(Nodding)
Tobacco today sex tomorrow In three or four
years itll probably be against the law to
smile at strangers

VINNIE
(Remembering something)
Speaking of which are you still going ahead
with that deal on the Montecristos

AUGGIE

Its all set My guy in Miami said hed have
them within the next few weeks

(Pause)
Are you sure you dont want to go in with me
Five thousand dollars outlay a guaranteed
ten-thousand-dollar return A consortium of
Court Street lawyers and judges Theyre just
drooling to get their lips around some genuine
Cuban cigars

VINNIE
No thanks I dont care what you do but just
make sure you dont get caught okay The last
I heard it was still illegal to sell Cuban
cigars in this country

AUGGIE
Its the law thats buying Thats whats so
beautiful about it I mean when was the last
time you heard of a judge sending himself to
jail

VINNIE
Suit yourself But dont keep the boxes around
here long

AUGGIE
They come in they go out Ive got it planned
to the last detail

VINNIE

(Looking at his watch)
Ive got to get moving Terry will bust my
chops if Im late See you in September
Auggie

AUGGIE
Okay my man Love to the wife and kids et
cetera et cetera Drop me a postcard if you
can remember the address
VINNIE leaves AUGGIE turns back to his pizza and magazine

8 EXT EVENING FACADE OF THE BROOKLYN CIGAR CO

A shot of the darkening sky A shot of the cigar store We see the
lights go out AUGGIE comes outside locks the door and begins
pulling
down the metal gate in front of the windows Cut to

A shot of PAUL running down the street toward AUGGIE

PAUL
(Out of breath)
Are you closed

AUGGIE
You run out of Schimmelpennincks

PAUL
(Nods)
Do you think I could buy some before you leave

AUGGIE
No problem Its not as though Im rushing off
to the opera or anything

AUGGIE lifts the gate and the two of them go into the store
9 INT EVENING THE BROOKLYN CIGAR CO

PAUL and AUGGIE enter the darkened store AUGGIE turns on the
lights

and then goes behind the counter to fetch PAULS cigars PAUL on
the

other side notices a 35-millimeter camera near the cash register

PAUL
Looks like someone forgot a camera

AUGGIE
(Turning around)
Yeah I did

PAUL
Its yours

AUGGIE
Its mine all right Ive owned that little

sucker for a long time

PAUL
I didnt know you took pictures

AUGGIE
(Handing PAUL his cigars)
I guess you could call it a hobby It doesnt
take me more than about five minutes a day to
do it but I do it every day Rain or shine
sleet or snow Sort of like the postman

(Pause)
Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job
and my job is just a way to support my hobby

PAUL
So youre not just some guy who pushes coins
across a counter

AUGGIE
Thats what people see but that aint
necessarily what I am

PAUL
(Looking at AUGGIE with new eyes)
Howd you get started

AUGGIE
Taking pictures

(Smiles)
Its a long story Id need two or three drinks
to get through that one

PAUL
(Nodding)
A photographer

AUGGIE
Well lets not exaggerate I take pictures
You line up what you want in the viewfinder and
click the shutter No need to mess around with
all that artisto crap

PAUL
Id like to see your pictures some day

AUGGIE
It can be arranged Seeing as how Ive read
your books I dont see why I shouldnt share
my pictures with you

(Pause Suddenly embarrassed)
It would be an honor

10 INT NIGHT AUGGIES APARTMENT
AUGGIE and PAUL are sitting at the kitchen table opened boxes of
Chinese food pushed to one side Most of the surface of the table
sovered with large black photograph albums There are fourteen in
end’ the spine of each one is labeled with a year -- ranging from
wo 1990 One of these albums is open on PAULS lap

Close-up of one of the pages in the album There are six
black-and-white photos on the page each one of an identical scene
the

corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight oclock in the
morning In the upper right-hand corner of each photo there is a
small

white label bearing the date 8-9-87 8-10-87 8-11-87 etc PAULS
hand turns the page we see six more similar photographs He turns
the

page again same thing And again same thing

PAUL
(Astonished)
Theyre all the same

AUGGIE

(Smiling proudly)
Thats right More than four thousand pictures
of the same place The corner of 3rd Street and
Seventh Avenue at eight oclock in the morning
Four thousand straight days in all kinds of
weather

(Pause)
Thats why I can never take a vacation Ive
got to be in my spot every morning Every
morning in the same spot at the same time

PAUL
(At a loss Turns a page
then another page)

Ive never seen anything like it

AUGGIE
Its my project What youd call my lifes
work

PAUL

(Puts down the album and picks up
another Flips through the pages and
finds more of the same Shakes his
head in bafflement)
Amazing
(Trying to be polite)
Im not sure I get it though I mean how did
you ever come up with the idea to do this
this project

AUGGIE
I dont know it just came to me Its my
corner after all Its just one little part of
the world but things happen there too just
like everywhere else Its a record of my
little spot

PAUL

(Flipping through the album

still shaking his head)
Its kind of overwhelming

AUGGIE

(Still smiling)
Youll never get it if you dont slow down
my friend

PAUL
What do you mean

AUGGIE
I mean youre going too fast Youre hardly
even looking at the pictures

PAUL
But theyre all the same

AUGGIE

Theyre all the same but each one is different
from every other one Youve got your bright
mornings and your dark mornings Youve got
your summer light and your autumn light Youve
got your weekdays and your weekends Youve
got your people in overcoats and galoshes
and youve got your people in shorts and
T-shirts Sometimes the same people

sometimes different ones And sometimes the
different ones become the same and the same
ones disappear The earth revolves around the
sun and every day the light from the sun hits
the earth at a different angle
PAUL
(Looks up from the album at AUGGIE)
Slow down huh

AUGGIE
Yeah thats what Id recommend You know how
it is Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow time
creeps on its petty pace

Close-ups of the photo album One by one a single picture occupies
the
entire screen AUGGIES project unfolds before us One picture
follows
another the same place at the same time at different moments of
the
year Close-ups of different faces within the close-ups The same
people appear in different pictures sometimes looking into the
camera
sometimes looking away Dozens of stills Finally we come to a
close-up of Ellen PAULS dead wife

Close-up of PAULS face

PAUL
Jesus look Its Ellen

The camera pulls away AUGGIE leans over PAULS shoulder We see
PAULS
finger pointing to Ellens face

AUGGIE
Yeah There she is Shes in quite a few from
that year She must have been on her way to
work

PAUL
(Moved on the point of tears)
Its Ellen Look at her Look at my sweet

darling
Fade out
11 INT NIGHT PAULS APARTMENT

We see PAUL scribbling furiously in his legal pad lost in his
work

Behind him we see ten or twelve index cards pinned to the wall
The

cards are covered with writing One of them reads The woman with

PAUL stands up from his desk goes over to the wall pulls off one
he cards and studies it as he returns to his desk An instant

ater
e begins writing again

The intercom buzzer sings loudly in the other room PAUL continues
to
work oblivious to the noise The buzzer sounds again PAUL puts
down

his pen

PAUL
(Under his breath)
Shit

to the other room and presses the
talk button on the intercom)

PAUL walks to the door and opens it peering into the hall as he
waits

for RASHID to arrive A moment later RASHID appears -- dressed as
before the backpack slung over his shoulder He appears awkward
ill

at ease

PAUL
I didnt expect to see you again
RASHID

(Making the best of it)
Same here But I had a long talk with my
accountant this afternoon You know to see how
a move like this would affect my tax picture
and he said it would be okay

PAUL studies him with a mixture of bafflement and curiosity but
doesnt answer RASHID puts down his bag and begins looking around
the

apartment After a moment

PAUL
Thats it Just the two rooms

RASHID
(Continuing to study
his new surroundings)
This is the first house Ive been in without a
TV

PAUL
I used to have one but it broke a couple of
years ago and I never got around to replacing
it

(Pause)
Id just as soon not have one anyway I hate
those damn things

RASHID
But then you dont get to watch the ball games
You told me you were a Mets fan

PAUL
I listen on the radio I can see the games just
fine that way

(Pause)
The world is in your head remember

RASHID
(Smiles Continues to walk around Sees
a small pen-and-ink drawing hanging on
the wall above the stereo cabinet the
head of a small child He stops to
examine it)
Nice drawing Did you do that

PAUL
My father did Believe it or not that little
baby is me

RASHID
(Studying the drawing more carefully
Turns to look at PAUL then turns
back to the drawing)
Yeah I can believe it

PAUL
Its strange though isnt it Looking at
yourself before you knew who you were

RASHID
Is your father an artist

PAUL
No he was a schoolteacher But he liked to
dabble

RASHID

PAUL
Twelve thirteen years ago

(Pause)
Actually he died with his sketch pad open on
his lap Up in the Berkshires one weekend

his head As if to himself)

at
broken dishes

RASHID

(Mortified)
Im sorry They just they just slipped out
of my hands

PAUL
A little less clumsiness around here would be
nice dont you think

RASHID

(Growing defensive)
Im a teenager All teenagers are clumsy Its
because were still growing We dont know
where our bodies end and the world begins

PAUL
The world is going to end pretty soon if you
dont learn fast
(Pause PAUL reaches into his pocket and
pulls out his wallet then removes a
twenty-dollar bill)
Look why not make yourself useful Im just
about out of smokes Go around the corner to
the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins
of Schimmelpenninck Medias

(Hands the bill to RASHID)

RASHID

(Taking the bill)
Twenty dollars is a lot of money Are you sure
you can trust me with it I mean arent you
afraid I might steal it

PAUL
If you want to steal it thats your business
At least I wont have you around here making
noise

(Pause)
It might be worth it

RASHID visibly hurt by PAULS remark puts the money in his
pocket
For once he is unable to come up with a quick retort

RASHID walks out of the apartment PAUL watches the door slam

RASHID turns at the sound of PAULS voice momentarily losing his
balance As he grabs hold of the bookcase again to steady himself
more

books fall off the shelf and come tumbling to the floor An instant
later he lands on the floor as well

PAUL (contd)
What is it with you anyway Youre like a
human wrecking ball

RASHID

(Climbing to his feet Ashamed)
Im sorry Im really sorry I was trying to
reach for one of the books up there

(Points)
And then I dont know the sky fell on top of
me

PAUL

(With growing irritation)

It just wont do will it I go two and a half
years without being able to write a word and
then when I finally get started on something
when it looks as though I might actually be
coming to life again you show up and start
breaking everything in my house It just wont

backpack from the floor and begins
stuffing his things into it)
But all good things have to come to an end
right

PAUL
No hard feelings okay Its a small place
and I cant get my work done with you around

RASHID
You dont have to apologize
(Pause)
The coast is probably clear now anyway

PAUL
(Softening)
Are you going to be all right

RASHID
Absolutely The world is my oyster
(Pause)
Whatever that means
(He looks up at the bookshelf studying
the spot where the bag is hidden He
makes a quick resolute decision to
leave the bag where it is)

PAUL
Do you need some money Some extra clothes

RASHID

Not a penny not a stitch Im cool man
(Hoists the backpack over his shoulder
begins walking toward the door)

PAUL

(a little stunned by

RASHIDS decisiveness)
Take good care of yourself okay

before you cross the street
(Reaches for the doorknob opens
the door hesitates turns around)
Oh by the way I liked your book I think

banging is heard at the front door Cut to PAUL opening the door

RASHIDS AUNT EM is standing in the hall She is a black woman of

about

forty dressed in clothes that suggest she works in an office

AUNT EM
(Angrily)
Is your name Paul Benjamin

PAUL
(Taken aback)
What can I do for you

AUNT EM

(Barging into the apartment)
I just want to know what your game is mister
thats all

PAUL
(Horrified Watching her as she
charges around the room)

How the hell did you get into the building

AUNT EM
What do you mean howd I get in I pushed the
door and walked in What do you think

PAUL

(Muttering to himself)
The damn locks broken again

(Pause as he returns

AUNT EMS glare Louder)
And so you just barge in on strangers is that
what you do Is that your game

AUNT EM
Im looking for my nephew Thomas

PAUL
Thomas Whos Thomas

AUNT EM
Dont give me any of that I know hes been
here You cant fool me mister

PAUL
Im telling you I dont know anyone named
Thomas

AUNT EM
Thomas Cole Thomas Jefferson Cole My nephew

PAUL
You mean Rashid

AUNT EM
Rashid Rashid Is that what he told you his
name was

PAUL
Well whatever his name is hes not here
anymore He left two days ago and I havent
heard from him since

AUNT EM
And what was he doing here in the first place
Thats what I want to know Whats a man like
you messing around with a black boy like
Thomas for Are you some kind of pervert or
what

PAUL
(Losing patience)
Look lady thats enough If you dont calm
down Im going to throw you out Do you hear
me Right now

AUNT EM
(Getting a grip on herself)
I just want to know where he is

PAUL
As far as I know he went back to his parents

AUNT EM

(Incredulous)
His parents Is that what he told you His
parents

PAUL
Thats what he said He told me he lived with
his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth
Street

AUNT EM

(Defeated shaking her head)
I always knew that boy had an imagination but
now hes gone and made up a whole new life for
himself
(Pause)
Do you mind if I sit down
(PAUL gestures to a
chair she sits down)
Hes been living with me and his uncle Henry
since he was a baby And we dont live in
Manhattan We live in Boerum Hill In the
projects

PAUL
He doesnt go to the Trinity School

AUNT EM
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn

PAUL
(Beginning to show concern)
And his parents

AUNT EM
His mothers dead and he hasnt seen his
father in twelve years

PAUL
(Softly almost to himself)
I shouldnt have let him go

AUNT EM

(Studying PAUL)
Which brings me back to my original question
What was he doing here in the first place

PAUL
I was about to get run over by a car and your
nephew pulled me back He saved my life

(Pause)
I sensed he was in trouble so I offered to put
him up for a few days Maybe I should have
pressed him a little more I dont know I
feel pretty stupid about it now

AUNT EM
Hes in trouble all right But I dont have
any idea what it is

PAUL

(Sits down in a chair lets out a sigh

thinks for a moment Turns to AUNT EM)
Do you want something to drink A beer A glass
of water

AUNT EM
(Primly)
No thank you

PAUL
(Lapses into thought again
After a moment)
Has anything happened lately Anything unusual
or unexpected

AUNT EM

(Thinks)
Well one thing I suppose but I dont think it
has anything to do with this

(Pause)
A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and
said shed spotted Thomass father working at
some gas station outside of Peekskill

PAUL
And you told your nephew about it

AUNT EM
(Shrugs)
I figured he had a right to know

PAUL
And

AUNT EM
And nothing Thomas looked at me straight in
the eye and said I dont have a father As
far as Im concerned that son-of-a-bitch is
dead

PAUL
Those are pretty hostile words

The camera slowly closes in on her face as she speaks

AUNT EM
His father walked out on his mother a couple of
months after he was born Louisa was Henrys
younger sister and she and the baby moved in
with us Four or five years go by and then one
day Cyrus shows up out of the blue tail
between his legs wanting to patch things up
with Louisa I thought Henry was going to tear
Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the
door Theyre both big men those two and if
they ever started to tangle youd see some
teeth jumping on the floor I guarantee it
So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to
talk things over in quiet And the poor girl
never came back

PAUL (OFF)
You mean she just ran off with him and left her
little boy behind

AUNT EM
Dont put words in my mouth What Im saying is
she drove off in Cyruss car and went to the
Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink What Im
saying is that he imbibed too much in the way
of alcohol and that when they finished their
little talk three hours later and got back in
the car he was in no shape to drive But he
drove the car anyway and before he could get
her back to where she lived the damn fool ran
a red light and went straight into a truck

Louisa got thrown through the windshield and
was killed Cyrus lived but he came out of it
a cripple His left arm was so mangled the
doctors had to cut it off Small punishment for
what he did if you ask me

PAUL (OFF)
(Aghast)
Jesus

AUNT EM
Jesus had nothing to do with it If Hed been
involved He would have seen to it that things
worked out the opposite from what they did

PAUL (OFF)
It cant have been easy on him Walking around
with that on his conscience all these years

AUNT EM
No I dont suppose it has He was broken up
like nobodys business in that hospital when he
found out Louisa was dead

PAUL (OFF)
And hes never tried to get in touch with his
son

AUNT EM

Henry told Cyrus hed kill him if he ever
showed his face around our house again When
Henry makes a threat like that people tend to
take him seriously

PAUL and AUNT EM look at each other Cut to shot of the kitchen
sink

Water is slowly dripping from the faucet Hold for two or three
beats

CYRUS
You going to sit here all day

RASHID

CYRUS
Why dont you pick some other spot It gives a
man the creeps to be stared at all morning

RASHID
Its a free country isnt it As long as Im

(Approaching the car RASHID jumps

off the hood as CYRUS draws closer)
Let me give you some useful information son

garage across the road)

casing the joint so far you wont make but

proposition

RASHID
Im working on a sketch That old garage of

pressed against RASHIDS chest)
Lets see what you did Rembrandt

RASHID

CYRUS
Five bucks You mean youre going to charge me
five bucks just to look at it

RASHID
Once you look at it youre going to want to

the price five bucks So if youre not willing
to spring for it you might as well not bother

you miserable

Son-of-a-bitch Youre some piece of work
arent you

RASHID

(Shrugs)
I just tell it like it is mister

(Pause)

for gas

RASHID

a stool behind the counter reading his paperback copy of
Dostoyevskys

far
wall on the other side of the counter diligently and awkwardly
straightening the stacks of newspapers and magazines

(Addressing JIMMY with
unaccustomed irritation)
You heard her pipsqueak The lady and I have
private business to discuss Go outside and
stand in front of the door If anyone tries to
come in tell em were closed You got that

JIMMY
Sure Auggie I got it
(Pause)
The stores closed
(Pause thinks)
And when do I tell them its open

AUGGIE

(Snaps)
When I tell you its open Its open when I
tell you its open

JIMMY
(Hurt)
Okay Auggie I got it You dont have to yell

JIMMY goes outside and posts himself in front of the door

AUGGIE
(Looking closely at RUBY as
he lights a cigarette)
All right sugar whats on your mind

RUBY

(Pause Self-conscious)
Dont look at me like that Auggie It gives me
the creeps
AUGGIE
Like what

RUBY

Like what youre doing Im not going to eat
you up
(Pause)

I need your help and if you keep staring at me
like that I might start screaming

AUGGIE

(With an edge of sarcasm)

Help huh And I dont suppose this help has
anything to do with money does it

RUBY
Dont rush me okay Youre jumping to
conclusions before Ive even said anything
(Pause)
And besides its not for me
(Pause Realizing shes let the cat
out of the bag In desperation she
plunges on)
Its for our daughter

AUGGIE

(Shocked growing belligerent)
Our daughter Is that what you said Our
daughter I mean you might have a daughter
but I sure as hell dont And even if I did --

which I dont -- she wouldnt be our daughter
RUBY
Her name is Felicity and she just turned
eighteen
(Pause)

She ran away from Pittsburgh last year and now
shes living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn
with a guy named Chico Strung out on crack
four months pregnant

(Pause)
I cant bear to think about that baby Our
grandchild Auggie Just think of it Our
grandchild

AUGGIE
(Waving her off impatient)
Stop it already Just stop all this crap right
now
(Pause Changing the
subject With contempt)
Was that your idea to call her Felicity

RUBY
It means happiness

AUGGIE
I know what it means That still dont make it
a good name

RUBY
I dont know who else to turn to Auggie

AUGGIE
Youve suckered me before darling remember
Why should I believe you now

RUBY

Why would I lie to you Auggie You think it
was easy to come here and walk into this place
Why would I do it if I didnt have to

AUGGIE
Thats what you told me when I shoplifted that
necklace for you You remember baby dont
you The judge gave me a choice either go to
the can or enlist So instead of going to
college I wind up in the navy for four years
I watch men lose their arms and legs I nearly
get my head blown off and you sweet Ruby
McNutt you run off and marry that asshole
Bill

RUBY
You didnt write to me for more than a year
What was I supposed to think

AUGGIE
Yeah well I lost my pen By the time I got a
new one I was clean out of paper

RUBY
It was over with Bill before you ever came
home Maybe you dont remember it now but you
were pretty hot to see me back then

AUGGIE
You werent so lukewarm yourself At least at
first

RUBY
It fizzled baby Thats the way it goes But
we had our times didnt we It wasnt all bad

AUGGIE
A couple of moments Ill grant you that A
second or two snatched from the jaws of
eternity

RUBY
And thats how Felicity came into the picture
During one of those two seconds

AUGGIE
Youre conning me sweetheart I aint
responsible for no baby

RUBY
Then why do you think I married Frank I was
already pregnant and I didnt have much time
Say what you like but at least he gave my kid
a name

AUGGIE
Good old Frank And how is fat Mr Grease Monkey
these days

RUBY
Who the hell knows

(Shrugs)
He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago

AUGGIE
Fifteen years ago

(Shakes head)
It wont wash pumpkin No mother waits fifteen
years to tell a man hes a father I wasnt
born yesterday you know

RUBY

(Her lips start to tremble We see

tears falling from her one good eye)
I thought I could handle it I didnt want to
bug you I thought I could handle it on my own
but I couldnt Shes in real bad Auggie
AUGGIE
Nice try old girl Id like to help you out
You know for old times sake But all my spare
cash is tied up in a business venture and I
havent collected my profits yet Too bad You
caught me at the wrong time

RUBY

(Still crying)
Youre a cold-hearted bastard arent you
Howd you ever get so mean Auggie

AUGGIE
I know you think Im lying to you but Im not
Every word I told you is the Gods honest
truth

Pause Then cut to the store entrance The door suddenly bursts
open as

an IRATE CUSTOMER pushes his way past JIMMY We see JIMMY futilely
trying to hold him back

AUGGIE (contd)

(Shouting at customer Beside himself)
The stores closed Didnt you hear what the
kid told you The goddamn store is closed

34 INT DAY THE UPSTAIRS ROOM OF COLES GARAGE

We see RASHID working diligently The place is a pigsty cluttered
with

all sorts of debris rusty bicycles rags automotive parts a
female

mannequin broken radios shower curtains etc One by one RASHID
drags or carries these things toward the door At one point he
finds a

small portable black-and-white TV hidden under a rug The rabbit
ears

are broken the casing is covered with dust but other than that it
seems to be in reasonably good shape

35 EXT DAY OUTSIDE COLES GARAGE

RASHID and CYRUS are carrying the debris from the upstairs room and
throwing it into the back of an old red pickup truck Once they get
rid

of a load they go back inside for more Since RASHID is faster
they

are working out of phase when one is outside the other is inside
They work in silence CYRUS begins to huff and puff from going up
and

down the stairs Eventually after a number of trips he drops a
load

into the truck and stops He leans against the truck pulls out a
large cheap half-smoked cigar from his shirt pocket and lights
up

Close-up of the hook as he strikes the match After one or two
puffs on

the cigar RASHID appears with another load and tosses it into the
truck

CYRUS
Time for a pause

Without further ado RASHID promptly sits down on the rear bumper
of

the truck He does it so quickly the effect is comical He watches
CYRUS smoke Two or three beats

RASHID
I dont mean to be nosy but I was wondering
what happened to your arm

CYRUS

(Holds up his hook and

studies it for a moment)
An ugly piece of hardware isnt it

(Pause)
Ill tell you what happened to my arm

(Pause Remembering)
Ill tell you what happened

(Pause)
Twelve years ago God looked down on me and
said Cyrus youre a bad stupid selfish man
First of all Im going to fill your body with
spirits and then Im going to put you behind
the wheel of a car and then Im going to make
you crash that car and kill the woman who loves
you But you Cyrus Im going to let you live
because living is a lot worse than death And
just so you dont forget what you did to that
poor girl Im going to rip off your arm and
replace it with a hook If I wanted to I could
rip off both your arms and both your legs but
Im going to be merciful and just take off your
left arm Every time you look at your hook I
want you to remember what a bad stupid
selfish man you are Let that be a lesson to
you Cyrus a warning to mend your ways

RASHID
(Impressed by the sincerity
of CYRUSS speech)
And have you mended them

CYRUS
I dont know I try Every day I keep on trying
but its no easy task for a man to change his
nature

(Pause)
Im off the booze though Havent had a drop
in six years And now Ive got me a wife
Doreen Best damned woman Ive ever known

(Pause)
And a little boy too Cyrus Junior

(Pause)
So things have definitely improved since I got
fitted with this hook If I can just turn this
goddamn garage around Ill be in pretty good
shape

RASHID
You named the kid after yourself huh

CYRUS
(Smiling at the thought of his son)
That boys one in a million A real tiger

Cut to close-up of RASHIDS face He seems to be growing more and
more

upset
CYRUS (contd)
And what about you kid Whats your story
RASHID
(Turning away)
Who me I dont have a story Im just a kid
Fade out
36 EXT DAY OUTSIDE COLES GARAGE

Late afternoon RASHID and CYRUS continue loading debris into the
back
of the truck We see the black-and-white portable TV sitting on the
ground outside the office

After a few moments a ten-year-old blue Ford pulls up next to the
truck and stops It is driven by CYRUSS wife DOREEN She is an
attractive self-possessed woman in her late twenties CYRUS JUNIOR
is
sitting in a child-restraint seat in the back He is two years old

CYRUSS face lights up when he sees the car DOREEN cuts off the
engine
and gets out smiling at her husband RASHID suddenly forgotten by
CYRUS watches the exchange with keen interest

CYRUS
Hi baby Howd it go today

DOREEN

(Joking)
If I have to wash one more old ladys hair I
think my fingers would fall off

(She kisses him on the cheek)

CYRUS
Busy huh Thats good because things around
here sure were sleepy today

DOREEN

(Opening the back of the car
unstrapping JUNIOR from his seat and
picking him up in her arms)

Dont worry Cy Its early days yet
(Addressing JUNIOR but at the same
time catching sight of RASHID)

Say hello to Daddy

JUNIOR
(In his mothers arms excited
at seeing his father)

Dada Dada

CYRUS

(Taking the boy in his arms

and giving him a big kiss)
Hey there little tiger And what did you do
today

DOREEN
(Addressing RASHID as she
hands the baby to CYRUS)
Hello

RASHID
(Shyly)
Hello

CYRUS
(Noticing the exchange
between DOREEN and RASHID)
Jesus I almost forgot you were here Doreen
this is Paul My new assistant

DOREEN extends her right hand to RASHID

RASHID
(Shaking DOREENS hand)
Its only temporary On a freelance basis

CYRUS

(Turning JUNIOR toward RASHID)
And this one in case you havent guessed is
Junior

RASHID
(Studying JUNIOR carefully Mumbles
in a barely audible voice)
Hi there little brother

CYRUS
(To JUNIOR) Say hi to Paul

JUNIOR
Hi there little brother

CYRUS

(To DOREEN)
Hes helping me clean out that upstairs room
Might as well get this place looking good
anyway

(To RASHID)
I guess thats it for today sport Come back
tomorrow morning at eight and you can pick up
where you left off

(Starts walking to the office

with JUNIOR in his arms)

We see him through the window opening the cash register pocketing
the
money turning out the lights then coming out and closing the
garage

doors In the foreground we see RASHID standing with DOREEN He
looks

down at the ground too shy to say a word to her She studies him
with

a mixture of curiosity and amusement When CYRUS is finished
closing

up he walks toward them and says to RASHID

CYRUS (contd)
Do you want me to pay you now or can you wait
until tomorrow

RASHID
Tomorrows fine Theres no rush

37 EXT EARLY EVENING OUTSIDE COLES GARAGE

A little later We see RASHID sitting next to the TV outside the
office
door He is utterly still Hold for two three beats

38 INT EARLY EVENING INSIDE THE OFFICE OF COLES GARAGE

We see a pencil drawing being slid under the door It is an
excellent
rendering of the garage as seen from across the road

The camera moves in on the drawing until it occupies the entire
screen
Hold for two three beats

39 INT DAY PAULS APARTMENT

PAUL opens the door RASHID is standing in the hall holding the
black-and-white TV in his arms The knapsack is on his back His
clothes have become a little shabbier since the last time we saw
him

PAUL
(Surprised)
Hey its you

RASHID

(Serious)
I wanted to give you this as a token of my
appreciation
PAUL
Appreciation for what

RASHID
I dont know For helping me out

PAUL
(Eyeing TV suspiciously)
Where did you get that thing

RASHID
I bought it Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at
Goldbaums TV and Radio

(Hands TV to PAUL who takes it

in his arms RASHID smiles)
Well that just about takes care of it I
guess Youll be able to watch the ball games
You know as a little break from your work

(Begins to leave)

PAUL
Where the hell do you think youre going

RASHID
Business appointment Im seeing my broker at
three oclock

PAUL
Cut it out will you Just cut it out and come
back here

RASHID

(Looking at his watch Shrugs)
I dont have much time

(Returns to the doorway

enters the apartment)

PAUL

(Puts TV on the stereo cabinet)
Close the door

(RASHID closes the door)
Sit down in that chair

(Points RASHID sits down in the chair)
Now listen carefully Your Aunt Em came here a
couple of days ago She was sick with worry
out of her mind We had an interesting talk
about you Thomas Do you understand what Im
saying Your aunt thinks youre in trouble and
so do I Tell me about it kid I want to hear
all about it right now

RASHID
(Realizes he is trapped Shrugs Smiles
weakly Looks down at floor to avoid
PAULS gaze When he dares to look up
again PAUL is still glowering at him)
You dont really want to know

PAUL

(Impatient)
I dont huh And what makes you such an
authority on what I want or dont want

RASHID

(Sighs defeated)
Okay okay

(Pause)
Its all so stupid

(Pause)
Theres this guy see Charles Clemm The
Creeper thats what people call him The kind
of guy you dont want to cross paths with

PAUL
And

RASHID
I crossed paths with him Thats why Im trying
to stay clear of my neighborhood To make sure
I dont run into him again

PAUL
So thats the something you werent supposed to
see huh

Close-up of RASHID becoming more animated as he talks

RASHID

I just happened to be walking by All of a
sudden the Creeper and this other guy come
running out of this check-cashing place with
masks on their faces and guns in their hands
They just about ran smack into me The Creeper
recognized me and I knew he knew I recognized
him If the guy from the check-cashing place
hadnt rushed out then screaming bloody murder
he would have shot me Im telling you the
Creeper would have shot me right there on the

sidewalk But the noise distracted him and
when he turned around to see what was
happening I took off One more second and I
would have been dead

PAUL
Why dont you go to the police

RASHID
Youre joking right I mean thats your way
of trying to be funny right

PAUL
If they put this Creeper in jail then youd be
afe

n

RASHID
The man has friends And theyre not likely to
forgive me if I testify against him

PAUL
(Thinking)

What makes you think youll be any safer around
here Its only about a mile away from where
you live

RASHID
It might not be far but its another galaxy
Black is black and white is white and never
the twain shall meet

PAUL
It looks like theyve met in this apartment

RASHID
Thats because we dont belong anywhere You
dont fit into your world and I dont fit into
mine Were the outcasts of the universe

PAUL

(Studying RASHID)
Maybe Or maybe its the other people who dont
belong

RASHID
Lets not get too idealistic

PAUL
(Pause Breaks into a smile)
Fair enough We wouldnt want to get carried
away would we

(Pause)
Now call your aunt Em and let her know youre
alive
40 INT EVENING PAULS APARTMENT

PAUL and RASHID are watching the Mets on television They are both
smoking little cigars PAUL puffs on his calmly RASHID coughs

after

each puff of his He is clearly not used to smoking The television
has a defective tube the reception is poor and every now and then
one

of them stands up and bangs the top of the set to bring the picture
back into focus They watch the ball game in silence Close-up of
the

TV screen the batter swings An announcers voice is heard
describing

the action

4l EXT LATE AFTERNOON THE CORNER IN FRONT OF THE BROOKLYN
CIGAR CO

AUGGIE is alone closing up shop looking particularly scruffy and
unshaven Just as he finishes pulling down the last metal gate a
car
with Pennsylvania license plates comes speeding down Seventh

Avenue and

brakes to a sudden stop in front of the store It is a ten-year-old
Pontiac in rather sorry shape belching smoke with a defective

muffler

and a dented body AUGGIE distracted by the commotion turns and
looks

at the car

From AUGGIES POV we look into the car and see that the driver is
RUBY

McNUTT She leans out the open window and addresses AUGGIE in an
urgent voice

RUBY

climbs in They drive off

42 EXT EVENING THE STREETS OF BROOKLYN

We see RUBYS car as it travels through the Brooklyn evening

its way down Seventh Avenue to Flatbush Avenue then turning onto
Eastern Parkway and gliding past the Public Library and the

Museum as it penetrates the slums of Crown Heights and East New
York

RUBY
I told her she was going to meet her father

AUGGIE
You what

RUBY
It was the only way Auggie Otherwise she
wasnt going to let me see her

AUGGIE

RUBY

When I told her I was going to bring her father

home Shes dying to meet you Auggie

They drive on in silence for a few more seconds By now they have

entered one of the worst most dangerous parts of

the city We see

broken-down boarded-up buildings vacant lots strewn with rubble
trash scattered on the sidewalks RUBY turns down one of these

streets

then brings the car to a halt in front of a walk-u
spray-painted graffiti on the outer door KILL THE

INT DAY PAULS APARTMENT

It is morning RASHID is preparing a pot of coffee in the
kitchenette

PAUL stumbles out of the bathroom wiping his face with a towel
has

just woken up and is still groggy He approaches the table

PAUL
Ah coffee Smells good

RASHID

(Handing him a cup)
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast
open

PAUL

(Taking the cup and sitting down)
Thanks

(Begins to drink)

RASHID

What time did you get to bed last night

PAUL
I dont know Two or three It was pretty late

He
RASHID
You work too hard you know that

PAUL
Once a story gets hold of you its hard to let
go

(Pause)
Besides Im making up for lost time

RASHID
Just so you dont overdo it You dont want to
die of sleep deprivation before you finish

PAUL
(Almost to himself Looking up at
the photo of Ellen on the wall)
If you dont sleep you dont dream If you
dont dream you dont have nightmares

RASHID
Thats logical And if you dont sleep you
dont need a bed Saves you money too

(Pause)
So whats this story youre working on anyway

PAUL
If I tell you I might not be able to finish it

RASHID
Come on just a little hint

PAUL

(Smiling at RASHIDS eagerness Pause)
Okay just a little hint I cant tell you the
story but Ill tell you what gave me the idea
for it

RASHID
The inspiration

PAUL
Yeah right The inspiration Its a true story
anyway so I dont suppose it can hurt can it

RASHID
No way

PAUL
All right Listen carefully
Cut to

(The camera slowly moves in

for a close-up of PAULS face)
About twenty-five years ago a young man went
skiing alone in the Alps There was an
avalanche the snow swallowed him up and his
body was never recovered

RASHID
(Mockingly)
The end
PAUL
No not the end The beginning
(Pause)

His son was just a little boy at the time but
the years passed and when he grew up he
became a skier too One day last winter he
went out by himself for a run down the
mountain He gets halfway to the bottom and
then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock
Just as hes unwrapping his cheese sandwich he
looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice --
right there at his feet He bends down to take
a closer look and suddenly he feels that hes
looking into a mirror that hes looking at

himself There he is -- dead -- and the body
is perfectly intact sealed away in a block of
ice -- like someone preserved in suspended

animation He gets down on all fours looks
right into the dead mans face and realizes
that hes looking at his father

RASHIDS face We see him listening intently

PAUL (contd) (OFF)
And the strange thing is that the father is
younger than the son is now The boy has become
aman and it turns out that hes older than
his own father

The camera holds on RASHIDS face After a moment

PAUL (OFF)
So what are you going to do today

RASHID (Shrugs)
Read think do some drawings if I get in the
mood
He points to the coffee table we see the sketch pad anda
paperback
copy of Shakespeares Othello

RASHID (contd)
But tonight Im going to celebrate Thats
definite

PAUL
Celebrate What for

RASHID
Its my birthday Im seventeen years old
(looks at wristwatch)
as of forty-seven minutes ago and I think I
should celebrate having made it this far

PAUL
(Raising coffee cup)
Hey hey Happy birthday Why didnt you tell

me
RASHID
(Deadpan)

PAUL

I mean earlier We could have planned something
Close-up of RASHIDS face

RASHID
I dont like plans I prefer to take things as
they come

45 INT LATE AFTERNOON THE BOOKSTORE
A small cluttered independent bookshop

The scene begins with a close-up of the clerks face APRIL LEE a
Eurasian woman in her mid- to late twenties She is sitting behind
the

front counter with an open book before her Her expression is
puzzled

searching as if she has just remembered or recognized something
but

cant quite figure out what it is We see her looking toward the
back
of the store straining to listen in on PAUL and RASHIDS
conversation

RASHID (OFF)
Here we are
(Pause)

Rembrandts drawings Edward Hopper Van Goghs
letters

PAUL (OFF)
Pick two or three Now that the coffers are
open you might as well take advantage of me

As PAUL and RASHID start walking back in the direction of the
counter

APRIL lowers her gaze and pretends to be reading We see PAUL and
RASHID enter the field of the camera from behind PAUL puts a small
pile of art books on the counter

PAUL
Well take these please

APRIL looks up her eyes meet PAULS They study each other for a
brief

moment -- a significant exchange that does not escape RASHIDS
notice

APRIL
Will that be cash or charge

PAUL

(Taking out his wallet

and looking inside)
Better make it charge

(Removes the credit card

and hands it to APRIL)

APRIL

(Looking at he card smiles)
I thought I recognized you Youre Paul
Benjamin the writer arent you

PAUL

(Both pleased and surprised)
I confess

APRIL

I keep waiting for the next novel to come out
Anything in the works
RASHID

(Butting in with enthusiasm)
Its coming along At the rate hes going
hell have a story finished by the end of the
summer

APRIL
Wonderful When your next book is published
maybe you could come into the store and do a
signing Im sure we could get a lot of people
to show up

PAUL
(Still staring at APRIL)
Uh actually I tend to shy away from that kind

of thing

RASHID

(To APRIL)
Excuse me for asking but you arent married
are you

APRIL

(Taken aback)
What

RASHID
Perhaps I should rephrase the question What I
mean to say is are you married or seriously
involved with a significant other

APRIL
(Still astonished Bursts out laughing)
No At least I dont think I am

RASHID

(Smiling with satisfaction)
Good Then may I have the honor of extending
an invitation to you

APRIL
An invitation

Close-up of PAUL listening to the exchange between RASHID and
APRIL

RASHID
Yes an invitation I apologize for springing
it on you at the last minute but Mr Benjamin
and I are attending a celebration tonight and
we would be most pleased if you chose to
accompany us

(Looking at PAUL)
Isnt that right Mr Benjamin

PAUL
(Breaking into a broad smile)
Absolutely We would be honored

APRIL
(Smiling)
And whats the occasion of this celebration

RASHID
Its my birthday

APRIL
And how many people will be attending this
birthday party

RASHID
I wouldnt actually call it a party Its more
along the lines of a dinner in celebration of
my birthday

(Pause)
The guest list is quite restricted So far
theres Mr Benjamin and myself If you accept
that would make three of us

APRIL

(Ironic With a crafty smile)
Ah-hah I see A cozy dinner But arent
threesomes a little awkward How does the
phrase go--

RASHID

Threes a crowd Yes Im aware of that But I

have to keep an eye on Mr Benjamin wherever he
goes To make sure he doesnt get himself into

trouble

APRIL
And what are you his chaperone

RASHID
(With a straight face)
Actually Im his father
APRIL bursts out laughing amused by the mounting silliness of the
conversation

PAUL
Its true Most people assume Im his father
Its a logical assumption -- given that Im

older than he is and so on But the fact is
its the other way around Hes my father and
Im his son

46 INT EVENING CHINESE RESTAURANT IN BROOKLYN

In the background we see a number of other customers At one
table a

Chinese family is celebrating a birthday Toward the end of the
scene

they all get up to pose for a group photograph PAUL RASHID and
APRIL are sitting together at a round table They are in the middle
of

their meal

PAUL
So your mother grew up in Shanghai

APRIL
Until she was twelve She moved here in
forty-nine

PAUL

APRIL

(Smiling)
Muncie Indiana He and my mother met as
students But Im from Brooklyn My sisters
and I were all born and bred right here

PAUL

RASHID
Like me too

APRIL
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all
the people in the United States have at least
one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one
time or another

RASHID
No wonder its such a screwed-up place

PAUL

(To APRIL)
And the bookstore Have you been working there

APRIL
Its just a summer job Something to help pay
the bills while I finish my dissertation

PAUL
Your dissertation What subject do you study

APRIL

PAUL
What else Of course what else And what are
you writing about for your thesis

APRIL

(With mock pomposity)
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century
American Fiction

PAUL
Wow You dont fool around do you

APRIL

(Smiling)
Of course I fool around But not so much when
it comes to my work its true

(Pause)
Have you ever read Pierre or the Ambiguities

PAUL
Melville huh

(Smiles)
Its been a while

APRIL
Thats the subject of my last chapter
PAUL
Not an easy book

APRIL
Which explains why this hasnt been the easiest
summer of my life

RASHID
All the more reason to let ‘er rip tonight
sweetheart

(Raises glass)
You know go for the gusto

APRIL clinks her glass with RASHID and laughs merrily as PAUL looks
on
and smiles Cut to

47 INT NIGHT A BAR IN BROOKLYN

A noisy crowded blue-collar hangout APRIL PAUL and RASHID are
standing together looking rather tipsy They are engaged in
animated

three-way conversation but we cant hear their voices over the
din

A song is playing on the jukebox (Downtown Train by Tom Waits)
APRIL asks PAUL to dance He agrees As they dance RASHID looks
on

Even though the rhythm of the song is fast PAUL and APRIL dance
slowly tentatively not quite sure how to behave with each other

After a moment AUGGIE emerges from the back room with VIOLET his
flashy girlfriend hanging on his arm They are both plastered

AUGGIE
(Drunk smiling)
Hey man good to see you

PAUL
This is April Lee Auggie April say hello to
Auggie Wren

APRIL
(Smiling)
Hello Auggie Wren

AUGGIE
(Affecting the voice of a cowboy
tipping an imaginary hat)
Howdy Miss April Im right pleased to make

(Turning to VIOLET)
And this pretty little lady here is Miss
Vi-o-let Sanchez de Jalapeo the hottest chili
pepper this side of the Rio Grande Aint that

RASHID addressing AUGGIE)
Its his birthday so we decided to whoop it up

AUGGIE
(To RASHID)

AUGGIE

RASHID

(With feigned seriousness nodding)
Definitely Id say youve hit the nail on the
head

AUGGIE
Good Keep it up and maybe one day youll grow
up and become a great man like me

(Bursts out laughing)
PAUL puts his arm around AUGGIE addressing him in quieter tones
As

they talk APRIL and VIOLET look each other up and down smiling
awkwardly RASHID strains to hear what PAUL and AUGGIE are saying
to

each other

PAUL
Hey Auggie Ive just been thinking You

AUGGIE

(Thinking)
Help Hmm Its possible What did you have in

PAUL

AUGGIE

(Looking up and studying RASHID)
Hey kid You interested in a job I just got

48 INT DAY PAULS APARTMENT

Morning PAUL and RASHID sitting at the table eating breakfast
RASHID
is wearing a red T-shirt with the word FIRE emblazoned on the
back in
white letters We catch them in mid-conversation

PAUL
Its 1942 right And hes caught in Leningrad
during the siege Im talking about one of the
worst moments in human history Five hundred
thousand people died in that one place and
theres Bakhtin holed up in an apartment
expecting to be killed any day He has plenty
of tobacco but no paper to roll it in So he
takes the pages of a manuscript hes been
working on for ten years and tears them up to
roll his cigarettes

RASHID
(Incredulous)
His only copy

PAUL
His only copy

(Pause)
I mean if you think youre going to die
whats more important a good book or a good
smoke And so he huffed and he puffed and
little by little he smoked his book

RASHID
(Thinks then smiles)
Nice try You had me going for a second but no
no writer would ever do a thing like that
(Slight pause Looking at PAUL)
Would he

PAUL
(Amused)
You dont believe me huh
(Stands up from the table and begins
walking to the bookcase)
Look Ill show you Its all in this book

PAUL stands on a chair and reaches for a book on the top shelf In
doing so he catches sight of the paper bag RASHID planted there in
Scene 15 He studies it in bewilderment then picks it up and
dangles

it in the air as he turns toward RASHID

PAUL (contd)
Whats this

RASHID
(Squirming with embarrassment)
I dont know

PAUL
Is it your

n
che

RASHID
Yeah it might be

PAUL

(Shrugs not wanting to

make an issue of it)
Here catch

PAUL tosses the bag in RASHIDS direction The bag breaks open in
midair and a shower of twenty- fifty- and hundred-dollar bills
rains

down from the ceiling PAUL is stunned RASHID is watching the
world

crumble before his eyes

Fade out
49 INT DAY PAULS APARTMENT (LATER)

Fade in A few minutes later PAUL and RASHID are sitting at the
table

again the money stacked in neat piles between them Again we
catch

them in mid-conversation

PAUL
So youre saying it wasnt like that at all

RASHID
Not exactly I mean there was more to it than
I told you

PAUL
Christ You didnt just see what happened
They dropped the package on the ground and you
picked it up

RASHID
Yeah I picked it up
PAUL
And started to run

RASHID
And started to run

PAUL
(Sarcastic)
Good thinking

RASHID
Thats just it I didnt think I just did it

PAUL
You have one hell of a knack for getting into
trouble dont you

(Pause gesturing to the money)
So how much does it come to

RASHID
Six thousand dollars Five thousand eight
hundred and fourteen dollars to be exact

PAUL

(Shaking his head trying to

absorb this new turn of events)
So you robbed the robbers and now the robbers
are after you

RASHID
Thats it In a nutshell

PAUL
Yeah well you have to be nuts to do what you
did If you want my opinion you should give
this money back to the Creeper Just give it
back and tell him youre sorry

RASHID

(Shaking his head)
No way Theres no way Im giving that money
back Its my money now

PAUL
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper
finds you

RASHID
(Stubbornly)
That money is my whole future

PAUL
Keep up with that attitude and you wont have
a future

(Pause)
Seventeen is a hell of an age to die Is that
what you want

Close-up of RASHIDS face Fade out
50 INT DAY THE BROOKLYN CIGAR CO

We see RASHID mopping the floor He finishes up and carries the mop
to

the bathroom behind the cash register and puts it in the bucket
that is

sitting in the sink He turns on the tap and rinses the mop Just
to

the side of the sink there are two open cardboard boxes on the
floor
We catch a glimpse of the contents boxes of Montecristos (Cuban
cigars) AUGGIES shipment from Miami has arrived

RASHID turns off the tap but the water continues to trickle out in
a
small stream into the bucket RASHID doesnt notice

RASHID returns to the counter AUGGIE is standing by the door
getting

ready to go out For the first time he is clean-shaven his hair
is
combed and he is wearing dress-up clothes a bright red plaid
sports

jacket white slacks etc The effect is strange laughable

AUGGIE
Ill be back in about an hour Watch the
register while Im gone okay

RASHID
Sure thing See you later

AUGGIE waves goodbye and leaves
Cut to the bathroom Close-up of the bucket in the sink The water

is
overflowing spilling onto the boxes of Cuban cigars
Cut to the store RASHID is sitting behind the counter studying a
picture of a naked woman in Penthouse magazine

Cut to bathroom Close-up of water inundating the Cuban cigars

Cut to store Close-up of RASHID gaping at the photograph We hear
him
groan softly

RASHID
(Muttering to himself)
Jesus God save me

Dissolve

The jarring noise of the door opening RASHID hastily closes the
magazine and stashes it under the counter AUGGIE enters the store
with

two middle-aged men in dark pin-striped suits his lawyer-
customers

for the Cuban cigars

AUGGIE
(Addressing the TWO LAWYERS as they
enter He is obviously keyed up His
manner is jovial ingratiating)
It might be illegal but its hard to see where
the crime is if theres no victim No harm
done right

FIRST LAWYER
This is what it must have felt like to go toa
speakeasy during Prohibition

SECOND LAWYER
Forbidden pleasures eh

AUGGIE
(To RASHID)
Much business while I was gone

RASHID
A little Not much

AUGGIE

(To the LAWYERS)
This way gentlemen Lets retire to my office
shall we
He points to the bathroom behind the counter

The camera stays on RASHID as AUGGIE and the LAWYERS disappear A
second later we hear AUGGIE explode with rage

AUGGIE (OFF)
What the fuck is going on here Look at this
The goddamn place is flooded Holy fucking
shit Look at this Look at this goddamn mess

51 INT DAY PAULS APARTMENT
Close-up of RASHIDS face He is in tears

PAUL (OFF)
So you lost the job Is that what youre
telling me He just up and fired you

RASHID

(Scarcely able to speak)
It was more complicated than that There was a
reason

PAUL (OFF)
Well

RASHID
It wasnt my fault

PAUL (OFF)

(Irritated)
If you dont tell me what happened how do you
expect me to know that I need facts not
opinions

RASHID
(Struggling to speak
fighting back the tears)

The water was dripping see I turned it off
but it was still dripping and then Auggie had
to go out and so I left the back room And
later on well later on when Auggie
came back the whole place was flooded His
Cuban cigars got all messed up You know
soaked through just when he was about to
sell them to these rich guys in suits

Shot of PAUL standing in the middle of the room looking at RASHID
who
is sitting on the bed

PAUL
Cuban cigars You mean he had some hanky-panky
going with those guys

RASHID
I suppose so He never told me about it

PAUL
No wonder he was angry

RASHID
He was out five thousand bucks he said He
kept saying it over and over Five thousand
bucks down the drain He wouldnt stop

Five thousand bucks five thousand bucks
He was like out of his mind with those five
thousand bucks

Silence PAUL paces about the room thinking He sits down ina
chair
by the table Thinks some more

PAUL
Heres what youre going to do Youre going to
open up your backpack take out your bag of
money count out five thousand dollars and
hand it over to Auggie

RASHID
(Appalled)

What are you talking about
(Pause)

You cant be serious

PAUL
Im serious all right Youve got to square it
with Auggie Since you wont give the money
back to the Creeper you can use it to make
things right with Auggie Thats probably
better anyway Better to keep your friends than
to worry about your enemies

RASHID
(Stubbornly Fresh tears
falling down his cheeks)
Im not going to do it
PAUL
Youll do it all right You fuck up youve
got to undo the damage Thats how it works
buster If you dont do it Im going to throw
you out of here Do you understand me If you
dont pay Auggie what you owe him Im finished
with you

RASHID
I pay Auggie and Ive got nothing Eight
hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City

PAUL
Dont worry about it Youve got friends now
remember Just behave yourself and everything
will work out

52 INT NIGHT A BAR IN BROOKLYN

AUGGIE is sitting alone at the bar smoking a cigarette and
drinking a

beer He looks disgusted muttering to himself swearing under his
breath Business is slow and the place is almost empty

PAUL and RASHID enter and approach AUGGIE at the bar RASHID is
carrying a brown paper bag AUGGIE gestures with his head for them
to

follow him into the back room Cut to

The three of them taking their seats at a table in the back room A
long awkward pause

PAUL
The kids sorry Auggie

AUGGIE

(Scowls fiddles with the

napkin on the table)
Yeah well Im sorry too

(Pause)
It took me three years to save up those five
thousand bucks and now Im broke I cant
hardly pay for this beer Not to speak of
having my credibility destroyed Do you
understand what Im saying My credibility
So yeah Im sorry too About as sorry as
Ive ever been in my whole fucking life

PAUL
Hes got something to tell you Auggie

AUGGIE
If hes got something to tell me why dont he
tell it to me himself

Without saying a word RASHID lifts the bag off his knees and puts
it
on the table in front of AUGGIE AUGGIE eyes the bag suspiciously

RASHID
Its for you

AUGGIE
For me And what am I supposed to do with a
paper bag

RASHID
Open it

AUGGIE

(Taking a peek inside)
What is this some kind of joke

RASHID
No its five thousand dollars

AUGGIE

(Disgusted)
Shit I dont want your money you little
twerp

(Peeking inside the paper bag again)
Its probably stolen anyway

RASHID
What do you care where it comes from Its
yours

AUGGIE

And why the hell would you give me money

RASHID
So I can get my job back

AUGGIE
Your job Youve got five thousand bucks What

do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for

RASHID
To look at the dirty magazines I can see all
the naked women I want and it doesnt cost me
a cent

AUGGIE
Youre a dumb whacked-out little fuck do you

Auggie pushes the bag toward RASHID Without hesitating for a
second
RASHID pushes the bag back toward AUGGIE

PAUL
Dont be an ass Auggie Hes trying to make it
up to you cant you see that

AUGGIE

(Sighs shakes head

peeks into bag again)

PAUL
No hes not You are

AUGGIE
(Shrugs Begins to crack a smile)
Youre right I just wasnt sure you knew

PAUL

AUGGIE
(Peeking into the bag again Smiles)

RASHID

his hands on the table)

Good Im glad thats settled

53 INT DAY PAULS APARTMENT

PAUL is alone at his desk typing The keys suddenly stick jam up
PAUL

(Spreading his hands in front of his

face and addressing his fingers)
Pay attention boys Look sharp

54 INT DAY PAULS APARTMENT

Several hours later As before PAUL alone at his desk typing A
loud

knocking is heard at the door PAUL continues typing Another loud
knock on the door PAUL sighs stands up from his desk and leaves
the

workroom Shot of PAUL walking through the big room and opening the
front door Two black men are standing in the hallway One is very
large in his mid-thirties the other is small in his twenties
They

are Charles Clemm THE CREEPER and his sidekick ROGER GOODWIN

CREEPER
Mr Benjamin I presume

Before PAUL can respond CREEPER and GOODWIN push their way past
him

into the apartment GOODWIN slams the door behind him PAUL backs
up

nervously He positions himself by the windows that look down at
the

street

GOODWIN
You got a security problem in this building
you know that The lock on that door downstairs
is busted

CREEPER
Not a good idea in these troubled times You
never know what kind of trash might wander in
off the streets

PAUL
(Nervous)
Ill talk to the landlord about it tomorrow

GOODWIN
You do that Dont want no unpleasant
surprises do you
PAUL
(Looking them over)
And who do I have the pleasure of talking to

now
CREEPER
Pleasure
(Laughs)

I wouldnt call this pleasure funny man Id
say its more in the nature of business

PAUL

It doesnt matter I know who you are anyway
(Pause)

Youre the Creeper arent you

CREEPER
(Indignant)
The what

GOODWIN
(Whipping out a 45 automatic
and pointing it at PAUL)
Aint nobody calls Charles by that name to his

face
(Grabs PAULS arm and puts
him in a hammerlock)
Understand

PAUL
(Grunting in pain)
Sure I understand

Before GOODWIN can do any real violence the CREEPER waves him off
At

that moment PAUL glances out the window Shot of RASHID down on
the

street approaching the building Shot from RASHIDS POV We see
PAUL

upstairs with his back to the window moving his hand with a
shooing

gesture trying to warn RASHID of the danger Another shot of
RASHIDS

face puzzled Another shot from RASHIDS POV the CREEPERS head
enters the picture Another shot of RASHID he takes off running
down

the street As all this happens we hear the following

CREEPER (OFF)
Let me tell you the business were here about

We want your cooperation in helping us locate a
certain party We know hes been staying here

so we dont want no denials about it understand

PAUL
What party are you looking for

GOODWIN (OFF)
Little Tommy Cole A homeboy with a brain the
size of a pea

PAUL (OFF)
(Stalling)
Tommy Cole Never heard of him

By now RASHID is gone Shot of PAULS face He glances over his
shoulder at the street below Shot of the street no sight of
RASHID

anywhere Followed by a shot of PAUL CREEPER and GOODWIN standing
in

the room

CREEPER
Im not sure you heard me the first time We
know that boys been here

PAUL
You might think you know but youve got the
wrong information I never heard of anyone
named Tommy Cole

GOODWIN

(Strolling about the room Sees

RASHIDS sketch pad on coffee table)
Lookee here Charles Aint cousin Tommy fond
of doodling

He picks up the pad flips through it and then starts ripping up
the
drawings and tossing them on the floor

PAUL
Hey what the hell are you doing

Before GOODWIN answers CREEPER comes close to PAUL and without any
warning delivers a fast powerful punch to his stomach PAUL
doubles

over in pain and falls to the floor
CREEPER
So whats it going to be funny man Do you
cooperate or do we send you to the hospital

GOODWIN
(Walking toward the bookcase
addressing PAUL over his shoulder)
Hope you got some good Blue Cross baby

GOODWIN suddenly starts pulling books off the shelves and sweeping
them
violently onto the floor

55 EXT DAY IN FRONT OF THE BROOKLYN CIGAR CO

AUGGIE is standing with his arm on JIMMY ROSES shoulder We catch
them

in mid-conversation AUGGIE is talking JIMMY is doing his best to
follow him looking down at the ground and nodding surreptitiously
picking his nose As they talk we see PAUL walking down the street
in

their direction He is limping one side of his face is bandaged
his

left arm is in a sling

AUGGIE
If it happens it happens If it doesnt
it doesnt Do you understand what Im saying
You never know whats going to happen next and
the moment you think you know thats the
moment you dont know a goddamn thing Thats
what we call a paradox Are you following me

JIMMY
Sure Auggie I follow When you dont know
nothing its like paradise I know what that
is Its after youre dead and you go up to
heaven and sit with the angels

AUGGIE
(About to correct JIMMY when he
spots PAUL approaching the corner)
Jesus man youre one fucking mess

PAUL
(Shrugs)
It could have been worse If the cops hadnt
come I might not be standing here now

AUGGIE
Cops You mean they nabbed those cruds

PAUL
No The uh the Bobbsey Twins lit out
when they heard the sirens But at least they
stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull
(Pause Smiles)
Assaultus interruptus

AUGGIE
(Studying PAULS wounds)
Fuckus my assus They did some number on you

PAUL
For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth
shut Theres something to be said for that I
suppose

JIMMY who has been watching PAUL intently since his arrival
gently

and hesitantly raises his hand and touches PAULS bruised face
PAUL

winces slightly

JIMMY
Does it hurt

AUGGIE
Of course it hurts What does it look like

JIMMY
(Quietly)
I thought maybe he was pretending

PAUL
(To AUGGIE)
You havent heard from Rashid have you

AUGGIE
Not a peep

PAUL
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago but
she hasnt heard from him either Its
beginning to get a little scary
AUGGIE
That could be a good sign though It could
mean that he got away

PAUL
Or didnt
(Pause)
Theres no way of knowing is there

56 EXT DAY A BROOKLYN STREET

We see PAUL walking down the street returning home He spots a
young

black man from behind He is wearing the same red FIRE T-shirt
that

RASHID was wearing in Scene 48 PAUL growing excited limps
forward to

catch up with him Once he gets close enough he taps the young man
on

the shoulder

YOUNG MAN

(Wheeling around as if he

had been attacked Angrily)
What the fuck you want mister

PAUL
(Embarrassed)
Im sorry I thought you were someone else

YOUNG MAN
I aint someone else got it You can go fuck
yourself with your someone else

57 INT NIGHT PAULS APARTMENT

PAUL sitting in his easy chair continues to work on his story by
hand The apartment has more or less been put back in order but
several traces of the CREEPERS visit remain bits of broken
furniture

a pile of destroyed books in one corner etc

After a few moments PAUL gets up from his chair walks over to the
television set and turns it on We hear the crowd noises of a
baseball

game the voice of the announcer describing the action but there
is no

image Only a single white line across the black screen PAUL
mutters
under his breath and pounds the top of the TV An image jumps into
view a baseball game in progress PAUL backs up to watch The
moment

he steps back the image vanishes Once again we see the white line
across the black screen PAUL steps forward and pounds the TV
again

Nothing happens He pounds again and still the white line remains
The camera moves in slowly for a close-up of the TV screen The
camera

travels through it into the darkness After a moment we hear the
clicking of PAULS keyboard The sounds of typing resonate in the
void

58 EXT LATE MORNING THE BROOKLYN PROMENADE

look at APRIL and PAUL

64 EXT DAY PAULS STREET

Sunday morning PAUL and AUGGIE are walking together on the
sidewalk

old
red Coupe de Ville

PAUL

Nice machine Auggie Whered you find it

AUGGIE

65 INTEXT DAY PEEKSKILL COLES GARAGE

We see RASHID painting the walls in the upstairs room The room has
been transformed since the last time we saw it It is entirely bare
now

and neat as a pin With each touch of white paint that RASHID
applies

to the walls the look of the place improves He works with care
proud

of what he has accomplished so far

Suddenly the noise of a car down below RASHID goes to the open
window
and looks out Cut to

From RASHIDS POV We see CYRUS DOREEN and JUNIOR pull up in the
blue

Ford They get out DOREEN is carrying a large picnic cooler CYRUS
opens the back door and unbuckles JUNIOR from his seat

RASHID (OFF)
(Mumbling alarm in his voice)
Oh Jesus What are they doing here on Sunday

DOREEN

(Waving up to RASHID)
Hi Paul We decided to have a picnic Want to
join us

Cut to RASHID at the window

RASHID
Uh yeah sure
(Pause)
Just a minute Ill be down in a minute

Cut to RASHID in the upstairs room He crouches down puts the
brush he

has been working with on top of the open paint can and begins
wiping

his hands with a rag when suddenly the noise of another car is
heard

down below RASHID stands up to have a look Cut to

From RASHIDS POV We see the red Coupe de Ville limping into the
station with a flat tire The car stops PAUL and AUGGIE climb out
Cut to

Close-up of RASHID looking out the window His face registers
panic
alarm

RASHID
Jesus Christ

He begins running toward the door hoping to get downstairs to PAUL
and

AUGGIE before CYRUS can reach them In his haste he kicks over the
open paint bucket

The scene ends with a close-up of white paint oozing over the bare
wood
floor

66 EXT DAY IN FRONT OF COLES GARAGE

Shot of CYRUS DOREEN and JUNIOR by the picnic table unpacking
their

lunch The camera pans from CYRUS -- beginning to walk toward PAUL
and
AUGGIE -- to PAUL and AUGGIE who are standing by the gas pumps We
see

PAUL and AUGGIE looking in the direction of the office smiles
beginning to form on their faces At the precise instant CYRUS gets
to

them RASHID enters the frame panting hard from his dash down the
stairs

PAUL
(To RASHID)
Hi kid

RASHID

(Looking at PAULS wounds and

bandages He is shocked)
Wow They sure did a job on you

PAUL
Research I worked the scene right into my
story

(Pause)

That makes the medical bills one hundred
percent tax deductible

AUGGIE
(Under his breath)
Try selling that one to the IRS

CYRUS
(Watching the exchange with a
confused look on his face To RASHID)
You know these men
(Gesturing to the flat tire)
I thought we had some customers

AUGGIE
Yeah he knows us But youve also got some
customers

(Wheels around and kicks

the Coupe de Ville)

Fucking Tommy Leave it to him to drive around
with bald tires

PAUL
We came here to deliver some clean laundry

RASHID
(To CYRUS)
Its all right I really do know them

(Still confused but
trying to be friendly)

Paul Benjamin

Cut to close-up of RASHIDS face The sky has just fallen on top of
him

CYRUS
(More confused than ever
Turning to RASHID)
Thats funny His name is the same as yours
RASHID

(In a panic)
Well you and Junior have the same name too
dont you

CYRUS
Yeah but hes my son Nothing strange about
that Hes my own flesh and blood But here
you got the same name as this man here and
youre not even the same color

RASHID

(Improvising)
Thats how we met Were members of the
International Same Name Club Believe it or
not there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America
But only two in the New York metropolitan area
Thats how Paul and I got to be such good
friends Were the only ones who show up at
the meetings

AUGGIE

(Disgusted)
Youre full of crap kid Why dont you just
come clean and tell the man who you are

By now drawn by curiosity DOREEN has come over to where the four
men
are standing She is carrying JUNIOR in her arms

CYRUS
(Turning to PAUL)
What the hells going on mister

PAUL
(Shrugs gestures to RASHID)
You better ask him

AUGGIE
Yeah Rashid baby spill it

DOREEN
(In a loud voice)
Rashid

PAUL

(To DOREEN)
Sometimes Its what youd call a nom de
guerre
CYRUS
(More and more confused)
What the hell are we talking about

AUGGIE

(To RASHID)
Come on Tell him your real name The name on
your birth certificate

Close-up of RASHIDS face His lower lip is trembling Tears are
beginning to form in his eyes

RASHID
(Almost inaudibly)
Thomas

CYRUS
Paul Rashid Thomas Which one is it

RASHID
Thomas

AUGGIE

(Impatient)
Come on come on you yellow belly The whole
thing First name and last name

RASHID
(Trying to stall Tears begin
to slide down his cheeks)
What difference does it make

PAUL
If it doesnt make any difference why not just
say it

RASHID

(To PAUL his voice breaking)
I was going to tell him but in my own time

In my own time

AUGGIE
No time like the present man

CYRUS
(To RASHID)
Well
RASHID
(Blinking back the tears
Looking at CYRUS)
Thomas Cole My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole

CYRUS

(thunderstruck)
Are you making fun of me I wont be mocked Do
you hear me I wont let no punk kid stand
there and mock me

DOREEN

(Upset)
Cyrus

JUNIOR

(Reaching out to CYRUS)
Dada

RASHID

(Standing his ground)
Like it or not Cyrus thats my name Cole
Just like yours

PAUL
(To CYRUS)
Now ask him who his mother was

CYRUS
(Beside himself)
I dont like this I dont like it one bit

RASHID
Louisa Vail Remember her Cyrus

CYRUS
You shut your mouth You shut your mouth now

Unable to control his rage CYRUS hauls off and slugs RASHID in the
face RASHID falls to the ground

AUGGIE
(Alarmed)
Hey cut it out

AUGGIE takes a wild swing and clips CYRUS in the mouth DOREEN
seeing

her husband attacked gives AUGGIE a quick kick in the shins
AUGGIE
lets out a yell and starts hopping up and down in pain

DOREEN

(To AUGGIE)
Damn you Therell be none of that on my watch
you dumpy bag of shit

DOREEN puts down JUNIOR The little boy immediately runs over to
PAUL
and whacks him on his bad arm PAUL howls in pain and drops to the
ground The whole scene is quickly degenerating into chaos

In the meantime RASHID has climbed back to his feet He lines up
CYRUS rushes toward him and tackles him to the ground The two of
them roll around on the macadam fighting with all their strength
After a moment it looks as though CYRUS is getting the better of
the

struggle AUGGIE tries to pull them apart but to no avail

DOREEN (contd)
(Pounding CYRUS on the
back with her fists)
Stop it Stop it Youll kill him Cyrus

DOREENS shrieking voice brings the fight to a momentary halt
CYRUS

rolls off RASHID and stands up RASHID stands up as well But the
hatred between them has not subsided CYRUS raises his hook

DOREEN (contd)

(Screaming)
Hes your son goddammit Hes your son Do you
want to kill your son

Suddenly CYRUS stops He lowers his arm and buries his face in his
right hand A moment later he breaks down and weeps His sobbing
makes

a terrible sound pure animal misery He staggers around then
falls

to his knees unable to stop the tears

Cut to RASHID He stands there without moving watching CYRUS He
drops

his arms to his sides unclenches his fists Tears are pouring down
his

cheeks he is breathing hard Close-up of his face

Fade out
67 EXT DAY THE PICNIC TABLE OUTSIDE COLES GARAGE
Some time later

Long shot We see everyone from the previous scene sitting at the
picnic table eating lunch fried chicken lemonade potato chips
etc

The image has the effect of a still life

DOREEN is sitting next to CYRUS RASHID is holding JUNIOR in his
arms

gently rocking him as the child drinks milk from a bottle with his
eyes

closed AUGGIE and PAUL are sitting next to each other eating
chicken

and listening to DOREEN (who is the only one who has the energy to
talk) CYRUS looks sullen defeated Every once in a while he
steals a

glance at RASHID RASHID however pretends to ignore him keeping
his

eyes fixed on the sleeping JUNIOR

At first we hear nothing Then the camera moves in for a closer
shot
and we can begin to make out what DOREEN is saying As she speaks
we
see Paul reach into his pocket and take out a tin of his little
cigars
He leans forward and offers one to CYRUS but CYRUS reaches into
his
own pocket and offers PAUL a big cigar Paul accepts and lights up
CYRUS then lights up one of his own

DOREEN

It might not have been the smartest
investment but it didnt cost much and if
Cyrus can make a go of it well be able to
take care of our needs The man knows his way
around cars Ill tell you that but the
problem is this road is too far off the beaten
track Ever since they put in that mall the
traffic hasnt been too heavy around here But
you take the good with the bad right You do
your best and hope that things work out

Music begins to play Cut to

around the counter and takes a seat beside AUGGIE JIMMY studies

smile

AUGGIE (contd)

from behind the counter)

PAUL and AUGGIE leave the store together
71 INT DAY JACKS RESTAURANT

A cramped and boisterous kosher delicatessen with sports
photographs on

the walls old Brooklyn Dodger teams the 1969 Mets a portrait of
Jackie Robinson PAUL and AUGGIE are sitting at a table in the
back

studying the menus

PAUL

(Closing menu)
I have to pee If the waiter comes order me
a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale okay

AUGGIE
You got it

PAUL stands up and leaves to go to the mens room Alone at the
table

AUGGIE glances down at the empty chair next to him and sees a copy
of

the New York Post The paper is open to an article with a headline
that

reads SHOOTOUT IN BROOKLYN AUGGIE bends over to inspect the
article

more closely Close-up of the article We see photographs of
CHARLES

CLEMM (the CREEPER) and ROBERT GOODWIN and their names in the
captions

A secondary headline reads ROBBERS KILLED IN JEWEL HEIST In the
meantime as AUGGIE continues to study the article the WAITER
arrives

to take his order He is a round balding middle-aged man with a
weary

expression on his face

WAITER (OFF)
Whatll it be Auggie
AUGGIE

(Looking up)
Uh

(Pointing to PAULS empty place)
My friend over here would like a corned beef on
rye and a ginger ale

Shot of WAITER holding pencil and order pad

WAITER

(Reading the paper again Suddenly
remembers the WAITER is there)
Huh

WAITER

WAITER

AUGGIE

WAITER

AUGGIE
(Mystified Humoring the WAITER)
Uh sure Sol Anything you say Instead of

corned beef sandwiches

WAITER
(Deadpan)
Thanks I knew youd understand

The WAITER leaves AUGGIE looks down at the article again PAUL
returns
and sits down in his chair across from AUGGIE

PAUL
(Settling in)
So Are we ready

AUGGIE
Ready Any time you are

PAUL
Im all ears

AUGGIE
Okay

(Pause Thinks)
You remember how you once asked me how I
started taking pictures Well this is the
story of how I got my first camera As a matter
of fact its the only camera Ive ever had
Are you following me so far

PAUL
Every word

AUGGIE
(Close-up of AUGGIES face)
Okay
(Pause)
So this is the story of how it happened
(Pause)
Okay
(Pause)

It was the summer of seventy-six back when I
first started working for Vinnie The summer of
the bicentennial

(Pause)

A kid came in one morning and started stealing
things from the store Hes standing by the

rack of paperbacks near the front window
stuffing skin magazines under his shirt It
was crowded around the counter just then so I
didnt see him at first

AUGGIES face dissolves into PAULS Black-and-white footage
begins we

see AUGGIE acting out the events he describes to PAUL This scene
exactly duplicates the events shown earlier in Scenes 2 and 3 --
with

one difference The thief is now ROGER GOODWIN the same person who
beat up PAUL in Scene 54 the same person whose picture AUGGIE has
just

noticed in the newspaper The events unfold in silence accompanied
by

AUGGIES voice-over narration

AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
But once I noticed what he was up to I started
to shout He took off like a jackrabbit and by
the time I managed to get out from behind the
counter he was already tearing down Seventh
Avenue I chased after him for about half a
block and then I gave up Hed dropped
something along the way and since I didnt
feel like running anymore I bent down to see
what it was

We see AUGGIE chasing the kid giving up and bending down for the
wallet He starts walking back to the store

AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
It turned out to be his wallet There wasnt
any money inside but his drivers license was
there along with three or four snapshots I
suppose I could have called the cops and had
him arrested I had his name and address from
the license but I felt kind of sorry for him
He was just a measly little punk and once I
looked at those pictures in his wallet I
couldnt bring myself to feel very angry at
him

We see AUGGIE examining the pictures Close-ups of the pictures

AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
Roger Goodwin That was his name In one of the
pictures I remember he was standing next to
his mother In another one he was holding some
trophy he got from school and smiling like he
just won the Irish Sweepstakes I just didnt
have the heart A poor kid from Brooklyn
without much going for him and who cared about
a couple of dirty magazines anyway

Cut to Jacks Restaurant The WAITER arrives at the table with
their
orders

WAITER
Here you go boys Two corned beef sandwiches
Two ginger ales The fast way The simple way
(He leaves)

PAUL
(Putting mustard on his sandwich)
And

AUGGIE

(Taking a sip of his drink)
So I held onto the wallet Every once ina
while Id get a little urge to send it back to
him but I kept delaying and never did anything
about it

(Puts mustard on his sandwich)
Then Christmas rolls around and Im stuck with
nothing to do Vinnie was going to invite me
over but his mother got sick and he and his
wife had to go down to Florida at the last
minute

(Takes a bite of the sandwich chews)
So Im sitting in my apartment that morning
feeling a little sorry for myself and then I
see Roger Goodwins wallet lying on a shelf in
the kitchen I figure what the hell why not do
something nice for once and I put on my coat
and go out to return the wallet

Cut to black-and-white footage the housing projects in Boerum
Hill We

see AUGGIE wandering alone among the buildings bundled up against
the

cold At the same time we hear

AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
The address was over in Boerum Hill somewhere
in the projects It was freezing out that day
and I remember getting lost a few times trying
to find the right building Everything looks
the same in that place and you keep going over
the same ground thinking youre somewhere else
Anyway I finally get to the apartment Im
looking for and ring the bell

Shot of AUGGIE walking down a corridor in the housing projects
graffiti on the cinder-block walls He stops in front of a door and
pushes the buzzer

AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
Nothing happens I assume no ones there but I
try again just to make sure I wait a little
longer and just when Im about to give up I
hear someone shuffling to the door An old
womans voice asks Whos there and I say
Im looking for Roger Goodwin Is that you
Roger the old woman says and then she undoes
about fifteen locks and opens the door

Shot of a very old black woman GRANNY ETHEL opening the door A
rapturous expectant smile is on her face Even though the scene
unfolds in silence we see AUGGIE and GRANNY ETHEL mouthing the
dialogue that AUGGIE repeats to PAUL

AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
She has to be at least eighty maybe ninety
years old and the first thing I notice about
her is shes blind I knew youd come Roger
she says I knew you wouldnt forget your
Granny Ethel on Christmas And then she opens
her arms as if shes about to hug me

We see AUGGIE hesitate for a second As he reports the next little
part

of the story we see him giving in opening his arms and hugging

GRANNY ETHEL The hug is then repeated in somewhat slower motion

then

again in slow motion then again in very slow motion then again

in

motion so slow that it appears as a sequence of still photographs

AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
I dont have much time to think you understand
I had to say something real fast and before I
knew what was happening I could hear the words
coming out of my mouth Thats right Granny
Ethel I said I came back to see you on
Christmas Dont ask me why I did it I dont
have any idea It just came out that way and
suddenly this old womans hugging me there in
front of the door and Im hugging her back It
was like a game we both decided to play --
without having to discuss the rules I mean
that woman knew I wasnt her grandson She was
old and dotty but she wasnt so far gone that
she couldnt tell the difference between a
stranger and her own flesh and blood But it
made her happy to pretend and since I had
nothing better to do anyway I was happy to go
along with her

AUGGIE and GRANNY ETHEL enter the apartment and sit down in chairs
in
the living room We see them talking laughing Meanwhile we hear

AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
So we went into the apartment and spent the day
together Every time she asked me a question
about how I was I would lie to her I told her
Id found a good job in a cigar store I told
her I was about to get married I told her a
hundred pretty stories and she made like she
believed every one of them Thats fine
Roger she would say nodding her head and
smiling I always knew things would work out
for you

The camera pans slowly through GRANNY ETHELS apartment lingering
momentarily on various objects Among other things we see
portraits of

Martin Luther King Jr John F Kennedy family photographs balls
of

yarn knitting needles By the time this visual tour is completed
we

see AUGGIE entering the apartment again wearing his coat and
carrying

a large bag of groceries As described in the simultaneous
narration

AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)

After a while I started getting hungry There
didnt seem to be much food in the house so I
went out to a store in the neighborhood and
brought back a mess of stuff A precooked
chicken vegetable soup a bucket of potato
salad all kinds of things Ethel had a couple
fe)

£ bottles of wine stashed in her bedroom and

We see AUGGIE and GRANNY ETHEL at the dining-room table

so between us we managed to put together a
fairly decent Christmas dinner

food drinking the wine talking

AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
We both got a little tipsy from the wine I
remember and after the meal was over we went
out to sit in the living room where the chairs
were more comfortable

eating the

We see AUGGIE leading GRANNY ETHEL by the arm and helping her into

a
chair

We see AUGGIE in the bathroom As he pees

Then AUGGIE leaves the living room and walks to the bathroom
down the hall

AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
I had to take a pee so I excused myself and
went to the bathroom down the hall Thats
where things took another turn It was ditsy
enough doing my little jig as Ethels
grandson but what I did next was positively
crazy and Ive never forgiven myself for
it

cameras
just as he describes them

We see AUGGIE return to the living room with the camera

ETHEL

AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
I go into the bathroom and stacked up against
the wall next to the shower I see a pile of
six or seven cameras Brand-new thirty-five
millimeter cameras still in their boxes I
figure this is the work of the real Roger a
storage place for one of his recent hauls
Ive never taken a picture in my life and Ive
certainly never stolen anything but the moment
I see those cameras sitting in the bathroom I
decide I want one of them for myself Just like
that And without even stopping to think about
it I tuck one of the boxes under my arm and go
back to the living room

we see the boxes of

GRANNY

is sleeping soundly in her chair AUGGIE puts the camera down

clears
the table and washes the dishes in the kitchen

AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
I couldnt have been gone for more than three
minutes but in that time Granny Ethel had
fallen asleep Too much Chianti I suppose I
went into the kitchen to wash the dishes and
she slept on through the whole racket snoring
like a baby There didnt seem to be any point
in disturbing her so I decided to leave I
couldnt even write a note to say good-bye
seeing that she was blind and all so I just
left I put her grandsons wallet on the table
picked up the camera again and walked out of
the apartment

We see AUGGIE bending over the sleeping GRANNY ETHEL and deciding
not

to wake her We see him put the wallet on the table and pick up the
camera We see him walking out of the apartment Shot of the
closing

door

AUGGIE (VOICE-OVER)
And thats the end of the story

Cut to PAULS face PAUL and AUGGIE are sitting at the table
eating
the last bites of their sandwiches

PAUL
Did you ever go back to see her

AUGGIE
Once about three or four months later I felt
so bad about stealing the camera I hadnt
even used it yet I finally made up my mind to
return it but Granny Ethel wasnt there
anymore Someone else had moved into the
apartment and he couldnt tell me where she
was

PAUL
She probably died

AUGGIE
Yeah probably

PAUL
Which means that she spent her last Christmas
with you

AUGGIE
I guess so I never thought of it that way

PAUL
It was a good deed Auggie It was a nice thing
you did for her

AUGGIE
I lied to her and then I stole from her I
dont see how you can call that a good deed

PAUL
You made her happy And the camera was stolen
anyway Its not as if the person you took it
from really owned it

AUGGIE
Anything for art eh Paul

PAUL
I wouldnt say that But at least youve put
the camera to good use

AUGGIE
And now youve got your Christmas story dont
you

PAUL

(Pause Thinks)
Yes I suppose I do

PAUL looks at AUGGIE A wicked grin is spreading across AUGGIES
face

The look in his eyes is so mysterious so fraught with the glow of
some

inner delight that PAUL begins to suspect that AUGGIE has made the
whole thing up He is about to ask AUGGIE if he has been putting
him on

-- but then stops realizing that AUGGIE would never tell him PAUL
smiles

PAUL (contd)
Bullshit is a real talent Auggie To make up a
good story a person has to know how to push
all the right buttons

(Pause)
Id say youre up there among the masters

AUGGIE
What do you mean

PAUL
I mean its a good story

AUGGIE
Shit If you cant share your secrets with your
friends what kind of friend are you

PAUL
Exactly Life just wouldnt be worth living
would it

AUGGIE is still smiling PAUL smiles back at him AUGGIE lights a
cigarette PAUL lights a little cigar They blow smoke into the
air

still smiling at each other

The camera follows the smoke as it rises toward the ceiling Close-
up

of the smoke Hold for three four beats

The screen goes black Music begins to play Final credits
