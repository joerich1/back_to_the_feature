FIRST REVISION
January 20 2000
FADE IN
EXT YALE UNIVERSITY - DAY

The Harkness Tower looms over the gothic campus on this late
October day Its getting chilly and the leaves are almost
gone At the Branford Gate a wrought iron lattice is etched
with the motto For God for Country and for Yale

INT LECTURE HALL - DAY

The Midterm exam The huge lecture hall is filled with about
200 COLLEGE STUDENTS and a few TEACHING ASSISTANTS The
TAs are working their way up the center aisle passing out
the exams and blue books row by row The smug HEAD TA
stands at the front of the room

HEAD TA
The midterm is worth forty percent
of your grade but those of you
with a working knowledge of the
Franco-Prussian War shouldnt be
too concerned

In the aisle seat in the
VERY LAST ROW

DAVE GUTTENMACHER is flirting across the aisle with a CUTE
GIRL who seems to be enjoying Daves attention Then
interrupting the magic a SNOTTY TA arrives at his row and
hands Dave a stack of exams and blue books

SNOTTY TA
Good luck

Dave gives him a fake smile and nod He slowly takes a few
blue books and an exam off the stack and passes the rest to
the ANXIOUS WOMAN with granny glasses to his left

Dave writes on the bottom right corner of his exam Whats
your number and passes it across the aisle The Cute Girl
looks up from her exam then around to see if anyone is
watching She grabs Daves exam reads the note smiles and
writes back Dave takes the exam back and reads her response
under his Alana 6-0749

Dave smiles then casually takes a hard candy out of his
pants pocket unwraps it and puts it into his mouth He
looks around at the ridiculously frantic test-takers shakes
his head in disbelief and starts working

Dave looks over the exam thoroughly He flips through the
three pages then flips back A SIGH then he starts writing
in his blue book

Way down in the
FRONT ROW

sits ANGELA beautiful but a little intense She is writing
into her blue book a mnemonic device Pretty Boys Eat Fuzzy
Penne As she writes her tongue peeks out of the side of her
mouth

HEAD TA (0S)
This is a closed book exam Please
keep your study materials under
your desk

Directly behind her sits weasly ETHAN He stares at the back
of Angelas head intensely He looks around the room to see
if anyone is watching him then accidentally knocks his pen
onto the floor in front of himself

He looks around again then leans forward into Angelas hair
He inhales deeply and takes great pleasure in the smell
smiling broadly to reveal his horribly crooked teeth Angela
TURNS AROUND suddenly and Ethan PULLS BACK and LOOKS AWAY at
the last second

ETHANS POV

Amid the jumble of test-takers Ethan focuses in on Alana
surreptitiously passing some papers across the aisle to Dave

END POV

Ethan watches wistfully as Dave flirts with Alana He shakes
his head slightly in quiet resignation

BACK ROW

Dave looks at the exam The handwritten exchange now reads
Whats your number Alana 6-0749 Dave 6-1510 You
free this weekend Maybe Call me smiley face

Dave smiles then resumes casually filling his blue book He
carefully studies the exam and continues writing at a speedy
pace causing the Anxious Woman to make dagger eyes at him
Hes writing Explain the competing political
philosophies of Bismarck and Metternich their empirical
success and their cultural significance In fact Dave has
filled the blue book with the test questions but no answers
He closes the blue book and slips it into his jacket He
opens a fresh blue book

The Snotty TA walks up the aisle monitoring the exam Dave
motions him over

DAVE
(whispers)
Ive got to use the rest room
SNOTTY TA
(whispers)
Cant it wait

Dave looks at him incredulously Then a little too loudly

DAVE
Ive got a case of explosive
diarrhea thats a time bomb
waiting to go off Have you ever
danced with the devil in the pale
moonlight

A few students look over at Dave The Anxious Woman sidles
away from him

SNOTTY TA
(whispers)
Leave your test here

Dave looks down at the test (and Alanas phone number) for a
second then up at the TA He leaves his new (and blank)
blue book on top of his exam and walks out

INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE LECTURE HALL - DAY

Dave casually walks past the sign that says Restrooms --
and walks out of the building

INT SLACKERS ROOM - DAY

SAM SCHECTER and JEFF SARNO are playing a video game in the
common room of this three bedroom dorm suite Sam is an
overweight schlub with a beard Jeff a more athletic type
The game is StarCraft and several computer space marines

DAVE (V0O)

Sams inspiration takes the form
of some really devious plans

INT SMALL EXAM ROOM - DAY

Sam three years earlier less heavy and no beard is taking
a standardized test in a small room with some other STUDENTS
and a JAPANESE PROCTOR

DAVE (V0)
Before you start school freshman
year you have to prove your
proficiency in a foreign language
If you didnt take an AP course
in high school you have to pass
a written proficiency exam the
first week of school or spend the
next two years taking foreign
language courses at eight am on
the other side of campus

The test-takers are filling in their bubble sheets with
number two pencils Sam however is just relaxing His
answer sheet is blank and he doodles a skull and cross bones
Ore ONE SE test booklet written incidentally ENTIRELY IN

DAVE (contd V0)
So Sam whose only foreign
language experience is Pig Latin
tells them hes fluent in Japanese
and sits for the exam

Sam looks around then looks at his watch The second hand is
approaching the twelve to bring the time to an even 950 As
it ticks twelve the FIRE ALARM sounds The Proctor jumps up

JAPANESE PROCTOR
(Japanese subtitled)
Remain calm Leave your test
booklets and exit the room in a
single file line

The students proceed out of the room but Sam lags behind
The Proctor sees Sam still in his seat and runs up to him
JAPANESE PROCTOR (contd)
(Japanese subtitled)
Did you not understand my
instructions Leave your test
here and exit the room

Sam just smiles at him and nods but remains in his seat The
Proctor is frantic

JAPANESE PROCTOR (contd)
(Japanese subtitled)
Is it your wish to be burned alive
in a horrible manner

Sam clearly doesnt understand He offers the Proctor a stick
of gum The Proctor yells into his face

JAPANESE PROCTOR (contd)
(Japanese subtitled)
Your sacrifice both puzzles and
honors me I must flee now

He bows then runs out of the room Finally Sam pulls out a
HAND-HELD COPIER (battery operated three inch scan width on
sale at Office Depot for 12995) and quickly scans his
neighbors bubble sheet

FREEZE FRAME on SAM mid-scan

DAVE (V0O)
Now Sams not lazy and hes
certainly not dumb In fact his
schemes take a hell of a lot more
effort and brains than studying
but Sam likes to figure things
out To beat the system

UNFREEZE SAM
As he passes the copier over the sheet a three inch-wide
copy pops out of the top Sam tucks it into his test book for
later and walks out of the classroom
HALLWAY
On the other side of the door Sam smiles wickedly
INT SLACKERS ROOM - DAY
STILL FROZEN on SAM mid-wipe
DAVE (V0O)

More computer terrans SCREAM as theyre reduced to bloody red
pixels

JEFF
Dude Are you going to even try
Three marines arent gonna do jack

A different alien creature pops up on the screen and spits
red acid on the group of twenty hydralisks They begin to
explode one by one Jeff throws down the controller

INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE PROFESSOR NATHANSONS OFFICE - DAY

Jeff walks down the econ department hallway looking for his
Professors office Jeff locates the right door and walks up
to it

DAVE (V0O)
He figured hed ask Professor
Nathanson for an extension but
when he gets there he notices
something magical

Just as hes about to knock he sees a few papers sticking
out of a lucite bin attached to the door
DAVE (contd V0)
Nathanson had his students just
drop off the papers outside his
office Of course some losers
always turn theirs in early

Jeff looks up and down the hallway then quickly pulls out a
paper from the bin He starts looking it over He smiles
then pulls out the rest of the stack and begins shuffling
through them

Suddenly the DOOR OPENS and an ECON TA walks out

ECON TA

DAVE (V0)

Lie to Sams cheat and Jeffs

deceitful People say Ive got an
honest face but you tell someone
that and youre just asking for
trouble

INT MALL - DAY

Dave (a little younger) is walking through the mall with his
arm around a CUTE GIRL

DAVE (V0O)
I never knew just how good I was
at lying till I discovered the
Seed of Doubt Principle

Suddenly a different girl MOLLIE exits the Gap with her
two FRIENDS From about twenty feet away Mollie sees Dave
with the Cute Girl Dave turns his head and for a split
second makes EYE CONTACT with Mollie He turns white quickly
turns his head back and continues on with the Cute Girl

INT MOLLIES DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Dave walks into Mollies dorm room Shes on the verge of
tears

MOLLIE
I saw you with that girl I saw
you with your arm around her

Mollies ROOMMATES excuse themselves from the room
FREEZE on DAVE looking guilty as hell

DAVE (V0O)
I guess I didnt know what to say
And I know it sounds kind of
stupid at first But you never
know what people are willing to
believe until you look them
straight in the eye and tell them
a bald-faced lie

UNFREEZE DAVE

DAVE
It wasnt me

Mollie is shaken by this She cant believe he just said that

MOLLIE
What

DAVE
It wasnt me

MOLLIE

What do you mean it wasnt you I

DAVE
It wasnt me

Mollie truly doesnt know how to argue with this Shes
exasperated

MOLLIE
Youre trying to tell me that I
didnt see you yesterday at the
mall with some ugly slut girl

DAVE
It wasnt me I dont Know who or
what you saw but it wasnt me
You Know Id never cheat on you

She tries to shake off this incongruence but its too late
the seed of doubt has taken hold

She looks at Dave

For a really long time

But Dave shows absolute confidence

Dave takes her hands in his and looks straight into her
eyes With the purest most sincere face imaginable

DAVE (contd)
It wasnt me

INT SLACKERS ROOM - DAY
STILL FROZEN on DAVE laughing

DAVE (V0O)
A lie repeated often enough
creates a seed of doubt in
peoples minds It helps if they
want to believe you but either
way people are afraid of
confrontation Theyd rather
ignore whats right in front of
their own eyes and accept some
bizarre warped reality than call
you a liar

UNFREEZE DAVE still laughing Sam leaves his book and comes
back to the game He pushes Dave out of the way

SAM
Why dont you go get us some
Bulldog

DAVE
Fuck you asswipe

JEFF
Hey Dont you have to study

display Reanna looks on but instead of inducing nausea the
exhibition seems to titillate her She moves in

REANNA

towel

DAVE

delicate balance of gravity and
energy to cause the phenomenon

then averts his eyes

ETHAN

VAN GRAAF

Ethan is still averting his eyes but as Mrs Van Graaf
begins to purr Ethan slowly turns to her Slowly his shock
and disgust subside and his creepy smile begins to appear
Mrs Van Graaf opens her eyes and sees Ethan looking back at
her She smiles He smiles A connection

Ethan goes to sit on the edge of the bed accidentally
sitting on the TV remote The TV snaps back on and the Price
Is Right announcer shouts Shiela OBanion COME ON DOWN

Just then Angela bursts in with the Nurse and a full COMPANY
of DOCTORS

ANGELA

DAVE (V0)

Now I only heard the story second

workout Shes wearing headphones and reading a magazine

From out of the locker room Ethan enters wearing his dated
1980s sweatbands and Lets Get Physical workout clothes
He spots Angela and saddles up to the machine next to her
She doesnt notice him so he turns on the machine

Obviously not very familiar with the stair climber Ethan has
some difficulty working the controls He looks over at her
machine to match the settings

Finally settled in he turns to her trying to get her
attention He becomes momentarily dazed when he accidentally
eyes her oscillating ass He almost FALLS OFF the machine
but quickly regains his balance He turns to her again

Sensing a disturbance in The Force Angela turns to Ethan
She smiles hello

Dave keeps the conversation quiet

DAVE
Hey Ive lied about a lot of
things in my day but Im not
going to tell some girl I love her

lie about shit like that

Dave turns to leave but Sam stops him again Sam is slightly
embarrassed about confiding in Dave

SAM
So you wouldnt recommend this
plan for someone you were really
interested in

DAVE
I dont Know Why all the sudden
interest in the plan You find a
mail order bride on the internet

Dave starts Laughing and Sam retreats into his shell

SAM
No Its just

DAVE
Look Ive got to go to a study
roup now and put in a good word

ANGELA

RT

PHILLIP
Forget all that Hes not going to
ask that Its all redshift
formulae

DAVE
Which is of course the strongest
argument for blowing this all off
and getting some pizza

BARRY
Well maybe youre an expert in
astrophysics but we could use the
study time

DAVE
OK youre right But didnt you
think this class was going to be
more about looking at the stars
and appreciating their beauty than
mathematical formulas and crap

Barry and Phillip start CHORTLING like complete dorks

PHILLIP
No

I think what Daves saying is that
we cant lose sight of the big
picture here Weve got a final in

reminds me of the time Jeff was
doing whippets all night long and
put his dick in the Jiffy Pop

nothing more trippy than watching
that foil expanding on the stove
I remember sophomore year we
wouldnt even eat the popcorn
Wed just put batch after batch on
our little hot plate watching it

go
(beat)
Oh right So anyway

UNFREEZE

The vomit continues its voyage onto Sam with a loud SQUISH

SAM
I dont think Im going to see her

DAVE
Dude let me give you a little
advice Theres two kinds of
regret in this world for things
you did but wish you hadnt done
and for things you wish youd had
the nerve to try The second kind
of regret is far more painful

SAM
0K Lao Tzu Whats the relevance

DAVE
You should see this girl again
Give it another shot Remember the
motto of the Connecticut State
Lottery You cant win if you
dont play

SAM
I dont think so
DAVE

Its just not that important to me
DAVE
Right
SAM

Dave is a little embarrassed Hes avoiding eye contact

DAVE (contd)
I mean shes really sharp I like

sensitive

Dave pulls a Snickers bar out of his pocket and starts to eat
it Ethan stares at him

ETHAN
I know you guys think Im some
kind of nut case for trying to get
Angela to Like me

Dave puts down the Snickers bar

DAVE

ETHAN
Noted

DAVE
How do you even know if this girl
is right for you

ETHAN

DAVE
Let me ask you a question Are you

love with me but Id definitely
settle for sleeping with her

DAVE
Well you know what Thats not

DAVE

So youre ready to commit
yourself to this girl for the rest

Remember the bus scene in The
Graduate

ETHAN
Yeah hes swinging the cross and
they get on the bus

DAVE
Yeah right Theyre sitting there
in the back of the bus all pumped
up and excited because they just
ran off together So Nichols is
letting the film run out on the
camera or something and he tells
Dustin Hoffman and Catherine Ross
to cut So they stop acting They
just sit there Theyre not
smiling any more Theyre just
tired I guess from acting all day
Turns out Nichols keeps it in the
film He loves their ironic
expressions like what the hell
did we just do

ETHAN
0K So

to think that the Chinese built
the roads in America -- someone
must have told me the Chinese
built the railroads and I guess I
got confused When the Chinese
workers finished paving the road
theyd write Ching Ped on it in
big white letters in honor of who
I assumed was their emperor or
something Ching Ped

Dave looks out the window and sees the road marking XING
PED

DAVE
Pedestrian Crossing Ching Ped I

Angela walks over to Jeff who is feeding some pages through
a scanner Next to him is a stack of assorted fake coupons

ANGELA
What are you doing

JEFF
Scanning

ANGELA
OK what are you scanning

DAVE (0S)
Jeff tends to be somewhat of a
borrower

Dave and Sam have returned Jeff turns to them looking for
a signal

DAVE
Angelas cool Shes not going to
rat you out
Angela lowers her voice

ANGELA
No No of course not

Shes suddenly very interested in the conspiracy

ANGELA (contd)
Whats going on

DAVE
He borrows other peoples papers
and copies them

Angela takes a step back in surprise Sam is very
uncomfortable with this revelation

ANGELA
Youre kidding me Doesnt the
professor see the similarity
Jeff looks at Dave who subtly nods
JEFF

Jeff acquiesces

Look you think a TA would
notice if he read two identical

papers out of a hundred
ANGELA

Yes
JEFF

What are the odds
ANGELA

I dont know Ninety percent

JEFF

So youre admitting that ten
percent of the time the TAs not
going to notice And you also have
to factor in the possibility of
different TAs reading the
papers or maybe nobody reads the
papers at all and they just throw
‘em down the staircase to grade

em

ANGELA

JEFF

And now what if you take four
different papers and cut and paste
paragraphs from them to make a new
original paper What are the odds

then

ANGELA
I dont know

DAVE
Exactly

ANGELA
Whens it due

JEFF
Half hour

Angela shows a little moral indignation

ANGELA
So you guys are a bunch of
cheaters

DAVE
Lets just say rules were made to
be circumvented

Dave chuckles to himself
DAVE (contd)
Remember the time you got an
extension on your term paper
because of Ramadan

Sams still uneasy

SAM
Yeah I remember
DAVE
But the fasting wasnt really
worth it
ANGELA
And you guys never go to class
JEFF

I went toan African American
Studies class once

Angela walks over to the blinds and opens them She looks out
the window

ANGELA

Angela looks to Dave but he shrugs

DAVE

ANGELA

JEFF
You think five years from now your
boss at GlobalCom Corp is gonna
care whether you give him your
report or you give him a report

the Hamptons for the weekend to

Angela

INT DINING HALL - NIGHT

Angela and Dave are eating their dinners Angela is still a
little shocked

ANGELA
Its Like a whole underground
culture

DAVE
I guess you could say that

ANGELA
I never knew those kind of people
existed I mean it never even
occurred to me to cheat Well
actually once in junior high
the teacher left the room during
a science test I remember Tommy
Meldeau took out a cheat sheet and
passed it to me As soon as I
realized what it was I turned
bright red and passed it on

DAVE
Youre not exactly cut out for
that Lifestyle You have to have
a high level of confidence
ANGELA
Im confident

DAVE

it through to the end

flaw

do Risk everything for a woman
And theres no guarantee that when
they ride off into the sunset
theres not a big fucking cliff on
the other side

everyone stares at Dave

PROFESSOR TAFT
Nice to see you in class Dave
But I think what Rostand was
saying is that the potential
reward was worth the risk and only
by recognizing that fact could
Cyrano truly become the man he
always wanted to be

He reels back as the

discussion continues He just sits there thinking it over
then he springs to life Professor Taft watches silently as
