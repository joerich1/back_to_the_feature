MRS BROWN BY JEREMY BROCK
EXT THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE FOREST - NIGHT

Begin on black The sound of rain driving into trees
Something wipes frame and we are suddenly hurtling through
a forest on the shoulders of a wild-eyed kilted JOHN
BROWN Drenched hair streaming head swivelling left and
right as he searches the lightening-dark A crack to his
left He spins round raises his pistol smacks past
saplings and plunges on

EXT THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE FOREST - NIGHT

Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree and heaves for
air A face in its fifties mad-fierce eyes handsome
bruised lips liverish He goes on searching the dark
Stops Listens through the rain A beat Thinking he
hears a faint thump in the distance he swings round and
races on

EXT THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE FOREST - NIGHT

BROWN tears through the trees pistol raised at full arms
length breath coming harder and harder But even now
theres a ghost grace a born hunters grace He leaps
fallen branches swerves through turns in the path eyes
forward never stumbling once

EXT THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE FOREST - NIGHT

BROWN bursts into a clearing breaks to the centre and
stops With his pistol raised he turns one full slow
circle His eyes take in every swerve and kick of the
wildly swaying trees

Theres a crack and a branch snaps behind him He spins
round bellows deep from his heart

BROWN
God save the Queen

And fires

Nothing happens The trees go on swaying the storm goes
on screaming and BROWN just stands there staring into
empty space A pause

Slowly he starts to frown as the fact begins to dawn on
him that he is alone He stares at the thrashing trees
waving their mocking arms at him His hand lets the pistol
drop to his side He feels the rain drench down his face
And now for the first time we see that his socks have
fallen to his ankles and his knees are cut to shreds He
shifts a foot His dress-shoes are covered in mud He
goes on staring into the dark Nothing

Just the wind and rain Gradually we pull back higher
and higher As we do we hear the quiet cultivated voice

FADE IN

PONSONBY (VO)
I have sent for a Mr John BROWN from

CUT TO
INT OSBORNE HOUSE QUEEN VICTORIAS DRESSING ROOM - DAY

The screen is black As the camera pulls back we discover
that we are looking at a black night-gown

Queen VICTORIA is sitting at her dressing table while an
elderly HAIRDRESSER also in black works at her hair

PONSONBY (VO)

The depths of the Queens sorrow
remain impenetrable She has now
restricted herself to a regime of such
ferocious introspection that we are
all at our wits end

INT OSBORNE HOUSE PRINCE ALBERTS DRESSING ROOM - DAY

A bust of the Prince Consort is draped in black His desk
is laid out as if for work A VALET is brushing one of his
suits before laying it carefully on the bed

PONSONBY (VO)

The Household continues at her
instruction to observe the rituals
now so familiar to her in a vain
attempt to render vivid that which can
never be revived
Close-up on a small table as a shaving brush is placed
carefully beside a dish of freshly poured water

INT OSBORNE HOUSE QUEEN VICTORIAS DRESSING ROOM - DAY

The hairdresser is pulling VICTORIAs hair back into the
widows cape For the first time we see her face It is
set in a mask of severity

PONSONBY (VO)

It will not surprise you to hear
that she continues steadfast in her
refusal to accept any public
engagements however trivial

INT OSBORNE HOUSE QUEEN VICTORIAS BEDCHAMBER - DAY

A bronze cast of Prince Alberts hand hangs above the Royal
bed His sleeping-gown is laid out on one side

A somberly dressed middle-aged man stands by the bed
DOCTOR JENNER the Queens physician He is placing
potions and medicaments in a row on the bedside table

Behind him TWO MAIDSERVANTS are busy stripping and
remaking the bed while another raises the window to air the
room

PONSONBY (VO)

Family and staff expend all their
efforts endeavouring to draw her out
of this state of unfettered morbidity
but to no avail Indeed Doctor
Jenner will not undertake to vouchsafe
her sanity unless some remedy is
found

INT OSBORNE HOUSE QUEEN VICTORIAS DRESSING ROOM - DAY

VICTORIA is turning slowly around as a young ASSISTANT
DRESSER completes the fastening on her black crepe dress

PONSONBY (VO)

We must hope therefore that this
Mr Brown will appeal to the Queens
sentimental though deeply-held view
that all Highlanders are good for the
health If she can at least be
persuaded to take the air the
prospect of further recovery may seem
less remote
The assistant dresser pulls too tightly on her dress
VICTORIA winces slightly

ASSISTANT DRESSER
(terrified)
Sorry maam

EXT THE SEA FRONT ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

We glide slowly past the coastline as a caption reads
ISLE OF WIGHT 1864

bearing the Royal coat of arms

John BROWN leads his pony along the dockside towards the
waiting driver He is in his late thirties fit handsome

INT OSBORNE HOUSE PRIVATE SECRETARYS ROOM - DAY

SIR HENRY PONSONBY the Queens Private Secretary is

prisoners of the Queens grief

(beat)
Ever your devoted husband Henry

He folds the letter and slips it into an envelope He is a
middle-aged man in a dark mourning suit tall Saturnine
and with a civil servants stoop As he looks up we see a
white-stockinged FOOTMAN standing to attention by the door
PONSONBY hands the letter to him

Silence

Among the diners we catch our first glimpse of BERTIE the
Prince of Wales He is in his mid-twenties plump stiff
dressed and balding He stands next to his young wife
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA who fiddles nervously with her shawl
trying to keep warm

As BERTIE smooths down his thinning hair DOCTOR JENNER
bustles into the dining room stands himself next to
PONSONBY and proceeds to conduct a hurried conversation
with the Prince of Wales entirely in whispers

JENNER

in

BROWN looks straight at this man quiet and reserved

BROWN

The DRIVER shrugs and slams the doors on them
INT OSBORNE HOUSE CORRIDOR AND QUEENS DINING ROOM - DAY

VICTORIA reaches the dining room door and takes a deep
breath LADY ELY and LADY CHURCHILL stop a pace behind

VICTORIA
How many

LADY ELY is slightly taken aback
LADY ELY
The Royal Family and senior members of

the household maam

VICTORIA
Just them

LADY ELY
Yes maam

VICTORIA closes her eyes then steels herself and steps
through the door

INT OSBORNE HOUSE QUEENS DINING ROOM - DAY

Everyone stiffens as VICTORIA walks in Acknowledging the
other diners with a quick nod the Queen takes her place

She flaps open her napkin and bang on cue everyone else
sits and does the same The meal is served immediately by
waiting SERVANTS who plonk the food down without ceremony

Its a very ordinary meal of meat and vegetables VICTORIA
starts eating heartily straight away Everyone does the
same
Only the clink of cutlery and the same eerie silence
EXT OSBORNE HOUSE THE GROUNDS - DAY

The Royal horse-carrier rattles into the grounds and on
down the driveway past the beautiful manicured lawns
stretching away towards the ornate twin towers of Osborne
House A few outdoor servants watch its progress
curiously

INT OSBORNE HOUSE QUEENS DINING ROOM - DAY

The silence continues as VICTORIA finishes her plain
pudding Immediately servants appear at every place and
whip away the pudding bowls whether their owners have
finished or not Nobody thinks this odd it is part of the
routine DOCTOR JENNER clears his throat

JENNER
Were expecting Brown this afternoon
maam

VICTORIA
Whom

A beat VICTORIA takes a sip of water dabs her mouth with
her napkin and rises Everyone else rises too Suddenly
the Queen turns to Berties nervous wife PRINCESS
ALEXANDRA and proclaims abruptly

VICTORIA (CONTD)
Thats a very pretty shawl you are
wearing Alex Silk suits you well
(beat)
But you are not eating enough One
must not let vanity overrule ones
appetite

PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
Yes maam

VICTORIA nods earnestly Lost to the effect her words have
had she marches out again Behind her she leaves
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA feeling humiliated and crestfallen in
front of all the others BERTIE takes her hand and
squeezes tight trying awkwardly to console

EXT OSBORNE HOUSE - DAY

The horse-carrier pulls up outside the servants entrance
and the DRIVER opens the doors

JOHN BROWN pulls out a watch from his waistcoat and checks
the time His eyes narrow critically

BROWN
I was due at a quarter past one
(beat)
Youre late

INT OSBORNE HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

A few minutes later JOHN BROWN strides down the long
corridor with PONSONBY at his side Their journey takes
them down an endless series of corridors past servants and
householders hurrying about their duties The presence of
the dead Albert is felt all around in the black-wreathed
portraits and busts that crop up along the way

BROWN and PONSONBY could not be more contrasted

PONSONBY

(in low tones)
Her Majestys routine at Osborne House
is not as you will remember it The
Household remains in full mourning and
no-one is permitted to raise their
voice under any circumstances
whatsoever As for the Queens
routine she breakfasts at nine
thirty lunches at twotakes tea at
five thirty and dinner at eight forty
five No one is allowed to leave the
building while the Queen is at home
On the rare occasions when she is out
you may ask permission to leave but
only with my consent
Youre to be ready to walk the pony at
any time after ten oclock Youll
clean her outdoor things and do any
odd jobs as and when she requires

BROWN
How will I know

PONSONBY
(surprised to be interrupted)
Im sorry

BROWN
How will I know what she requires
A beat

PONSONBY
Youll be sent a message

BROWN
Wholl bring it to me

PONSONBY
Her Highness Equerry

BROWN
I need a man who knows where I am

PONSONBY
Im sure it wont be difficult to find
you

BROWN
Thats not good enough

PONSONBY
Then well have to see what can be
arranged

BROWN
Aye do

PONSONBY stiffens A beat

PONSONBY
There is to be no communication with
other members of the household on
matters concerning the court except
through myself or one of the
Equerries No plans must be altered
unless you are given prior authority
by myself or a senior member of the
household

BROWN
I came down at the Queens request
Ill take my orders from her

PONSONBY
In matters concerning the Household I
act on her behalf

BROWN takes the measure of him

BROWN
Do you
PONSONBY
Yes
(beat)
I do

BROWN glances up the corridor

BROWN
So is passing wind out of the
question or do I need permission for
that

PONSONBY refuses to acknowledge what he has heard They
reach the door of the Royal Chamber and he concludes the
interview

PONSONBY
As I am sure you remember from
Balmoral you do not talk while in Her
Majestys presence unless Her Majesty
addresses you directly

BROWN refuses to answer so PONSONBY knocks After a
moment the door is opened by LADY ELY who ushers them in

INT OSBORNE HOUSE QUEENS SITTING ROOM - DAY

BROWN walks stiffly into the room and stops PONSONBY
waits by the door

PONSONBY (0S)
Mr Brown maam

VICTORIA is bent over the desk working at one of her
numerous red boxes She scribbles furiously at a letter
underlining and accenting words as she goes Finally LADY
ELY steps up to her side and whispers something in her ear
She carries on working

BROWN has time to survey the room Dominating everything
are the same black-wreathed busts and portraits of Prince
Albert glimpsed in the corridor

Finally VICTORIA nods and LADY ELY beckons BROWN forward
He steps up in front of the desk and waits VICTORIA looks
up and BROWN bows deeply

Silence

She stares at him for a long moment without apparently
registering who he is He towers over her in bright
tartan while she sits hunched in her seat all in black
and knotted with tension

Finally she finds her voice She sounds nervous and edgy

VICTORIA
Mr Brown

BROWN
Maam

VICTORIA

You are here safely

BROWN
Aye maam

VICTORIA
You are well

BROWN
I am

VICTORIA
And the pony

BROWN
Shes well too

VICTORIA blinks at the sight of him His presence is
bringing him back A beat

VICTORIA
Your family sent cards It was much
appreciated

BROWN

Im glad of it

In an effort to control her emotions VICTORIA now sounds
the same severe note as at lunch But BROWN unlike
others seems unaffected

VICTORIA
My husband was always very
complimentary in speaking of you He
would have approved I am sure of my
calling on you in this way
(beat)

I trust it does not inconvenience you
too much
BROWN
Ive no family maam apart from my
brothers and sisters

VICTORIA
Yes
(beat)
You have a brother in service here do
you not

(furrowing her brow)
I forget his name

BROWN
Archie

VICTORIA
Yes
(beat)
That will be company for you

BROWN
Yes maam

Silence VICTORIA starts to tire She takes a sip of
water and spills a little on herself Flustered she
searches for a hanky but cannot find one LADY ELY hurries
up with one of her own and the Queen dabs it off BROWN
watches all of this with genuine concern When VICTORIA
finally looks up he stares at her in deep sympathy

BROWN (CONTD)
Honest to God I never thought to see
you in such a state You must miss
him dreadfully

VICTORIA stares back in stunned silence PONSONBY coughs
involuntarily LADY ELY freezes A beat

VICTORIA
You do not - he get him out
(beat)
Get him out Get him out

Suddenly BROWN finds himself tugged backwards out of the
room LADY ELY rushes up to assist as VICTORIA shouts
herself into a fit of uncontrolled sobbing

INT OSBORNE HOUSE BROWNS QUARTERS - DAY
Some minutes later BROWN is angrily unpacking a trunk

His humiliation expresses itself in the extraordinary
ferocity with which he slams down every object
His younger brother ARCHIE sits on the bed Hes in his
early thirties bright sharp and dressed in the same
distinctive kilt and tweed

ARCHIE

(telling it fast)
So the day they arrive she greets the
Sultan and his family with barely a
word and then retires to her chamber
he Sultan not used to State
ccasions without a head of State is
tanding in the lobby waiting for
omeone to tell him what to do But
he court is under strict instructions
ot to talk in the corridors so nobody
peaks to him not a living soul for
he whole afternoon So now its
inner and everyones standing round
he table -- still not a word --
waiting for Her Majesty to arrive
One hour goes by two the Sultans
getting a wee bit peckish to say the
least So finally his wee laddy
breaks for the cold meats and stuffs a
slice in his mouth Well the uproar
when she heard Youd have thought
someone had stolen the crown jewels

tadupdtuwnonw

BROWN stares back still pissed off

BROWN
So

ARCHIE
So there are rules Things you do
and things you dont do

BROWN
I was just telling the woman how I
feel for Gods sake

ARCHIE
You dont tell Her Majesty how you
feel

BROWN

I speak as I find Archie

ARCHIE
Not down south you dont
BROWN slams a drawer shut ARCHIE lets it go and watches
his brother A beat

ARCHIE (CONTD)
So what did Ponsonby do when she
started shouting

BROWN
I think he nearly ruptured his truss

A beat then both men burst out laughing
INT OSBORNE HOUSE SERVANTS HALL - DAY

The clatter of voices and banging doors as under servants
hurry about with plates knives and forks laying the Upper
Servants huge table for dinner ARCHIE leads BROWN
through this rush of activity

BROWN
How much

ARCHIE
Seventy a year

BROWN
Not bad not bad

ARCHIE
How about yourself

BROWN

ARCHIE
(grinning)
Thats pretty good for a ghillie

BROWN smiles dryly They pour themselves a drink from the
table

BROWN
Prince Leopold Is he the one who
bleeds all day So what does his
valet do Wash his poultices for him

ARCHIE
Its better than shovelling horse
shit

BROWN

If you were looking for promotion you
should have picked one of the
healthier ones

ARCHIE
Shes hardly a full hamper herself

BROWN
(beat)
Its only grief makes her like she is

ARCHIE
Three years John Is that not a bit
long to be grieving

BROWN
She loved him

ARCHIE
Come on man Theres love and
theres

BROWN
What

ARCHIE

You know what I mean

BROWN
Im not sure I do Archie

ARCHIE
Theres love and theres behaving like

Hold on BROWN He lets it go and moves on Across the
hall he spots the pretty ASSISTANT DRESSER watching them

BROWN
Which one of us is she flirting with

ARCHIE
The good-looking one

BROWN
Aye Then shes obviously not got
enough to do

ARCHIE
You work the system right you could
ask her yourself Just be thankful
youre not working for Household The
Queen never lets them out of her
sight But wee spats like us can slip
through the net easy

A beat BROWN stares straight at him

BROWN
Im no wee spat ARCHIE

INT OSBORNE HOUSE UPPER CORRIDOR - MORNING

The next day VICTORIA and her ladies are hurrying down a
corridor on her way into the dining room VICTORIA
suddenly stops and stares out of the windows Her
entourage are several steps past her before they realize
whats happened and scurry back to take up their positions
behind

Now we see what has caught her attention BROWN is
standing in the courtyard below by his pony She watches
him for a moment then without reacting walks on

EXT OSBORNE HOUSE - AFTERNOON
Some hours later It is now raining

A gaggle of ROYAL GRANDCHILDREN hurry out of a carriage
from their afternoon recreational while their NANNIES
frantically try to keep them dry under the umbrellas John
BROWN stands tall and erect on the gravel while they rush
around him laughing and giggling

INT OSBORNE HOUSE UPPER CORRIDOR - EVENING

Rain on the window VICTORIA is walking in the opposite
direction down the corridor with her entourage She stops
at the same place as before

VICTORIA
(as if she had not seem him
earlier)
Who is that

Lady Ely peers through the rain

LADY ELY
Its Mr Brown maam

VICTORIA
What is he doing there

LADY ELY
He appears to be standing by his

horse

VICTORIA
I made no request to go out riding
today

(beat)
How long has he been there

LADY ELY
I dont know maam
(nervously)

He was observed earlier I believe
At this moment PONSONBY comes down the corridor
VICTORIA

Sir Henry Mr Brown is standing in the
courtyard I have no wish to go

riding

PONSONBY
Im very sorry matam I cant
imagine -- he was certainly given no
instructions

VICTORIA
Please make sure it does not happen
again

PONSONBY

Of course at once
VICTORIA takes one last look and walks away
INT OSBORNE HOUSE PRIVATE SECRETARYS CHAMBERS - NIGHT

Half an hour later PONSONBY stands at his desk facing
BROWN

PONSONBY
What on earth did you think you were
doing

BROWN stares straight back

BROWN
Awaiting my orders

PONSONBY
You do not report for duty unless the
Queen requests it You know that very
well

BROWN
I didnt come all this way to sit on
my arse

PONSONBY

You will await your orders like
everyone else Unless you prefer a
repeat of yesterdays little
excitement

BROWN
No

PONSONBY
I beg your pardon

INT OSBORNE HOUSE UPPER CORRIDOR - DAY

The next day From a high window we see PONSONBY
scuttling madly across the courtyard towards the figure of
JOHN BROWN who is standing exactly as he was the day
before

VICTORIA watches impassively
EXT OSBORNE HOUSE COURTYARD - DAY
PONSONBY stands close to BROWN shouting in his face

PONSONBY
I thought I made myself perfectly
clear You do not leave your room
until Her Majesty requests it

BROWN

(eyes straight ahead

shouting back)
Well you tell Her Majesty from me if
her husband was here now hed have
had her out of that house and getting
some air in her What the hells the
point in me being here otherwise

From the window above VICTORIA takes in his words A
beat PONSONBY collects himself

PONSONBY
Go inside at once

BROWN
Is that the Queens request

PONSONBY
Yes it most certainly is

BROWN turns grabs the lead rein and leads his horse back
to the stables

INT OSBORNE HOUSE STABLES - DAY

A few minutes later BROWN is in the process of stabling
his horse Suddenly he turns

VICTORIA is standing at the far end of the stable with her
entourage

VICTORIA
Mr Brown

BROWN
Yes maam

VICTORIA

You have been told repeatedly not to
stand in the courtyard unless
requested to do so

BROWN
Yes maam

VICTORIA
Then why do you persist in doing it

BROWN
Because I think Her Majesty is wrong
If ever there was a poor soul who
needed fresh air it is her

A beat

VICTORIA
The Queen will ride out if and when
she chooses

BROWN
And I intend to be there when shes
ready

Silence The two of them stare at each other

EXT OSBORNE HOUSE THE GROUNDS - DAY
The next day high and wide over the stunningly manicured
landscape Long lawns wind-cropped copses and in the
distance the glittering sea

EXT OSBORNE HOUSE THE GROUNDS - DAY

VICTORIA sits side-saddle on a horse BROWN leads her in
silence

EXT CLIFFTOP - DAY
VICTORIA looks up

VICTORIA
Prince Albert was going to build a
bench here He thought it one of the
best views in Osborne

BROWN
Its a fine spot maam

VICTORIA
He thought so yes

She stares ahead

VICTORIA (CONTD)
In everything I do and everything I
say I try to think as much as
possible what he would do or say if
he were here now My Private
Secretary wishes me to return to
public duties--

She stops abruptly but BROWN cuts in

BROWN
If Prince Albert were here today hed
tell him a thing or two

VICTORIA
Sir Henry is not alone They all wish
it
(beat)
The same people who refused to grant
my husband the title of King because
he was deemed of insufficient rank--

She stops again cutting quickly back to small-talk

VICTORIA (CONTD)
It is a fine spot for a bench is it
not

BROWN
Aye maam

VICTORIA
Yes

A pause

VICTORIA (CONTD)
I have some letters in the saddle bag
I wish to read them

BROWN walks up to her side opens the saddle bag and hands
her a bundle of letters held together with ribbon

VICTORIA (CONTD)
I cannot read them like that

BROWN undoes the ribbon and tries again VICTORIA cuts in

VICTORIA (CONTD)
You will hand them to me as I require

BROWN takes off the top letter and hands it to her
INT OSBORNE HOUSE UPPER SERVANTS TABLE - NIGHT

The clatter and crush of the Upper Servants table as UPPER
SERVANTS sit themselves down to dinner while UNDER SERVANTS
prepare to serve soup

ARCHIE comes in and sits himself somewhere in the middle
next to an empty seat A moment later BROWN strides in

But instead of sitting at the place beside his brother he
goes straight to the head of the table and plonks himself
down Slowly the clatter dies away as the whole room
stops and stares at him in silence BROWN fixes them with
a look

An elderly butler steps into the room and stares in
amazement at BROWN A smooth young man BERTIES VALET
hurries up to intercede

BERTIES VALET
Mr Carter the Head Butler sits
there

BROWN
Not now he doesnt This is my place
BERTIES VALET
By whose authority

BROWN
My own

A little frisson of oh-my-gawdness BERTIES VALET stares
icily at him

BERTIES VALET
The order of seating at the Upper
Servants table is arranged personally
by the Queen herself

BROWN

Thats a tautology lad

(unable to stop himself

seriously explaining it)
If you say the Queen arranges
something youve no need to say shes
done it personally Thats
understood

But as far as BERTIES VALET is concerned it isnt He
stares down in mute fury then snaps his fingers at one of
the under servants who rushes over There is a hurried
exchange of whispers before the under servant rushes out

Unperturbed BROWN brings out his flask and pours himself a
substantial draft of whiskey He turns to the pretty
assistant dresser sitting to his right

BROWN (CONTD)
Are you dresser to Her Majesty

She blinks nervously at him

ASSISTANT DRESSER
Assistant sir yes

BROWN tucks into his soup Everyone watches and waits

BROWN
Whats your name

ASSISTANT DRESSER
Mary Taylor sir

BROWN
Have I seen you up in Balmoral Mary
ASSISTANT DRESSER
I hope to go up next year

BROWN
You wouldnt happen to know what the
Queens reading for recreation would
you Mary

The assistant dresser thinks for a moment

ASSISTANT DRESSER
Lord Tennyson sir

BROWN nods All conversation stops as the under servant
bursts back in She halts at the door looking blankly
from Berties valet to the elderly butler A beat The
old man stiffens and makes his way to the middle of the
table

BROWN looks up from his soup

BROWN
Am I the only one eating

With a clatter of spoons everyone obediently eats
INT OSBORNE HOUSE DRAWING ROOM - DAY

A few days later A morning drawing room Standing
round the unlit fireplace are DOCTOR JENNER LADY ELY LADY
CHURCHILL the two LADIES IN WAITING and PRINCESS
ALEXANDRA All are dressed against the icy wind that
whistles through the open window where VICTORIA sits
knitting busily while BERTIE stands beside her coat
buttoned up to the collar PONSONBY has stationed himself
opposite beside a desk piled high with red dispatch boxes
He runs through the daily itinerary

PONSONBY

Lord Clarendon arrives by invitation
at eleven oclock followed at twelve
by a picnic in the grounds to
celebrate Princess Alices birthday
Dispatches as usual at two

(finishes then coughs)
The Chancellor writes to say that by
happy coincidence he will be in Cowes
for the weekend He asks if Your
Majesty might grant him an audience

VICTORIA
Why
PONSONBY
He thought perhaps Your Majesty
might wish to be informed of the
latest developments in government

VICTORIA
No I shall be out walking

A beat BERTIE watches closely now PONSONBY coughs
again nervous

PONSONBY
Then perhaps Your Majesty might
consider it opportune if the Prince of
Wales were to meet him on your behalf

VICTORIA stiffens She speaks without turning

VICTORIA
On no account

PONSONBY gives up Politely but firmly BERTIE takes up
the reins

BERTIE
Mama I really do think its time we
made ourselves a little more
available

VICTORIA carries on knitting

BERTIE (CONTD)

I think we must accept our position in
the country is not entirely unrelated
to the continued absence of the
Monarchy from public life

(silence)
I thought perhaps we might consider a
small gesture of some kind

VICTORIA looks up sharply

VICTORIA
Gesture

BERTIE
I thought a dinner for our
ambassadors perhaps

VICTORIA
(cutting in firmly)
No dinners Bertie
(beat)
Why are you dressed for outdoors

BERTIE
Its so infernally cold in here

VICTORIA
Cold is good--
(calling across)
Is that not so Dr Jenner

JENNER
Im sorry maam

VICTORIA
Cold is good

JENNER
Excellent maam excellent
(trying his hand)
But perhaps if her Majesty were to
consider accompanying her new-found
physical vigor with the benefits of
mental activity

VICTORIA
(becoming very agitated)
Why am I being lectured in this way

JENNER
Forgive me Your Majesty In no way
did I wish to suggest--

VICTORIA
(cutting across him)
I will not tolerate anybody lecturing
me about the responsibility of the
monarchy

BERTIE
Mother

VICTORIA
Least of all my son It was his
irresponsibility that drove my husband
to his grave

An appalled silence With great dignity BERTIE absorbs
the shock of the insult and quietly steers the conversation
in another direction
BERTIE
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty
then perhaps she might consider
allowing the Prince of Wales to host--

VICTORIA
I do believe they send so many boxes
to taunt me
Doctor Jenner writes to them to say
that my nerves are in an extremely
fragile state and yet they continue to
hound me with box after box after box
after box after box

Silence VICTORIA has crossed to the window and stares out
at the view Having recovered her composure she turns to
address them all

VICTORIA (CONTD)
I wish to take the Princesses for a
swim

For a moment nobody believes what they have heard She
continues

VICTORIA (CONTD)
The turns I have been taking in the
grounds have proved most beneficial to
me and Brown thinks that salt water
will do me good

Bertie stares at her in silence while PONSONBY and DOCTOR
JENNER exchange a worried look

EXT PRIVATE BEACH ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

The doors of the Royal bathing-machine swing open and Queen
VICTORIA in a voluminous swim-dress sails out like a duck
into the freezing sea As she does so the doors of the
other machines open and Princess Helena and Princess Louise
follow her in Dignity does not allow them to shout out
but their expressions of constipated agony are a picture

VICTORIA begins swimming around in a vigorous little
circle

VICTORIA
Dont potter children Swim

Hold for a moment on the princesses miserable faces

EXT OSBORNE HOUSE - DAY
Half an hour later PONSONBY DOCTOR JENNER LADY ELY and
two FOOTMEN watch as BROWN helps VICTORIA up some steps and
onto her horse He glances at the stiff line of
householders and mutters curtly to himself

BROWN
You could buy that lot for garden
ornaments and still see change from
ten guineas

The household do not hear this but QUEEN VICTORIA has
overheard and tries to suppress a smile

As she settles into the saddle her foot comes loose
BROWN fastens it into the stirrups

BROWN (CONTD)
Lift your foot woman

Everyone hears this VICTORIA obeys Taking the reins he
then walks the QUEEN out of the courtyard As they vanish
from site we hear

INT THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY

The speech continues as we follow the progress of a
Tomahawk cartoon doing the rounds of the Tory back benches
from knee to knee It is entitled Where is Britannia
and shows an empty throne draped with the Royal cloak

DISRAELI (0S)
but by a chain of traditions that
have been cherished from generation to
generation because in them -- in our
traditions -- are embodied all the
laws which have enabled us to create
the greatest empire of modern times

During the above the cartoon reaches the front benches and
lands on the knees of the young earnest STANLEY As he
frowns at the picture in front of him DISRAELI winds up
DISRAELI (CONTD)

but even though we have amassed
great capital and even though we have
established an industry with no
parallel in the world yet all these
mighty creations are as nothing
compared to the invisible customs that
shape our lives To those honorable
gentlemen of the opposition who seek
to destroy the essential elements of
this country I say let them remember
England cannot begin again

During this peroration we see DISRAELI for the first time
He is handsome obviously Jewish and wire thin like
Dickens on Slimfast He dresses almost dandyishly but
speaks with startling vigor a combination of brilliance
and cheek that is his key To cheers from his back
benchers he sits

As he looks up he catches the eye of his opposite on the
Liberal benches GLADSTONE is different in almost every
respect dour dogged heavy-set and tall They stare
levelly for a second then DISRAELI flashes a brilliant
smile

STANLEY plops the cartoon on his lap

STANLEY
Have you seen this

INT THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT LOBBY CORRIDOR - DAY

A few minutes later DISRAELI and STANLEY are strolling
down the busy lobby corridor Throughout their talk Tory
back-benchers bustle up to pat their hero on the back and
offer their congratulations

STANLEY
Should we take it seriously

DISRAELI
The cartoon or Her Majestys
absenteeism

STANLEY
Well both

DISRAELI

The question is do we need her

STANLEY
Surely youre not suggesting we
dispense--

DISRAELI
My dear Stanley a Prime Minister with
only a handful of friends must respect
public opinion

The pass GLADSTONE in a huddle of cohorts

DISRAELI (CONTD)
Gossip counts Lord Aberdeen was
right This country is not governed
by wisdom but by talk

(beat)

Granted it wouldnt take much to
winkle the old girl out of mourning
but if public opinion is against her
then it doesnt do to appear too
close

STANLEY

DISRAELI
Well see which way the wind blows

DISRAELI sweeps through a prattle of back-benchers

EXT PUBLIC BEACH ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

Burns at the sea

My hearts in the Highlands wherever I

ARCHIE stares at him A beat

ARCHIE

thunders through gathering dark toward Balmoral Castle

CAPTION BALMORAL
EXT BALMORAL CASTLE - TWILIGHT

A mass of torches encircle the ROYAL PARTY as kilted
GHILLIES and STAFF swarm round the carriage opening doors
and clambering off boxes while a regiment of PIPERS play
them in

Amid this swarm of activity we glimpse BROWN opening the
door to a smiling VICTORIA as she climbs down followed by
PRINCESS HELENA and PRINCESS LOUISE Emerging from another
carriage come BERTIE and PRINCESS ALEXANDRA staring grim
faced at the castle HENRY PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER
alight from their carriage as PONSONBY slips on his gloves
and pinches his nose at the pain of remembrance

EXT LOCHNAGER - DAY
The next day

High over the vast bleak mountains of Lochnager and Loch
Muick VICTORIA and BROWN are riding fast towards the top
Reaching the summit VICTORIA points excitedly at the far
horizon

BROWN

VICTORIA
Those over there there

BROWN

How can I possibly say that with a
straight face

BROWN lets it go and they ride on
VICTORIA (CONTD)
I am thinking of publishing my
Highland Journals

BROWN
Are they worth reading

VICTORIA
(beat)

I am told so

BROWN
Who by

VICTORIA
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are
charming

BROWN

What does he know about the Highlands

VICTORIA
He has been attending at Balmoral for
many years

BROWN
That doesnt make him an expert

VICTORIA
His remarks were directed at the
quality of the writing not its
subject

BROWN
I dont groom a horse to have it
admired by others I groom it because
it needs grooming

VICTORIA
(curtly)
I do not do it for others But
Ponsonby thinks they are good

BROWN
Just say what you have to say woman
What other people think shouldnt
matter to you

VICTORIA
(snapping)
Of course I shall say what I have to
say I always do

The stare at each other until BROWN kicks his horse on

BROWN
Aye well if all you want is a good
opinion then hed be sure to oblige
you

VICTORIA

(riding alongside)
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was
their literary merit a skill not
intimately associated with the
knowledge of grooming

(beat)
Literary appreciation does not begin
and end with Tennyson

BROWN lowers his head

VICTORIA (CONTD)
(in a softer tone)
I mention you in them

BROWN says nothing

VICTORIA (CONTD)
In particular the occasion when
Albert was alive the Royal Carriage
overturned during a storm and you
demonstrated such loyal service in
returning the Queen and the Princesses
safely to Balmoral

supper alone in her private drawing
room and retire early

PONSONBY
Shell need to sign dispatches before

PONSONBY

BROWN
It can wait Anything else

JENNER
Are you sure Her Majesty is up to such
a long journey She has only just
recovered from a severe head cold

BROWN
If I thought she wasnt up to it I
wouldnt let her go would I

BROWN snaps together his papers and walks out leaving
PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER standing lamely at the table

EXT BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

The next morning The ROYAL FAMILY are picnicking in the
grounds VICTORIA walks along a path accompanied on one
side by BROWN on the other by BERTIE

BERTIE is in mid-plea

BERTIE
Surely it is for the gentlemen to
decide when to stop

VICTORIA
It is a disgusting habit Bertie It
should be discouraged
BERTIE
Yes but isnt midnight a little
excessive

VICTORIA
It is quite late enough

BERTIE
But mama the room was built expressly
for that purpose It has been a
smoking-room by tradition ever since
father --

VICTORIA
(cutting in angrily)
Browns responsibilities are onerous
enough already He has far too much
to do without having to stay up all
night waiting for you to go to bed
The smoking-room will be closed and
the lights put out at twelve oclock

BERTIE
Mama

VICTORIA
And that is my last word on the
matter

BERTIE

Well Im sorry but I really do think
its too much that the gentlemen of
the house should be dictated to by a
servant

BROWN
Its the Queens decision

BERTIE
I beg your pardon
(to VICTORIA)
Mama

Before Bertie can continue BROWN steps right into his
face

BROWN
I think you should go now

BERTIE stares back too stunned to speak He glances at
his mother but VICTORIA looks off into the distance as if
she has not heard BERTIE turns and storms away

watching with amused detachment as a middle-aged couple
MR and MRS GRANT race about their tiny living room trying
desperately to make it presentable for the Queens sudden
visit They fling open the windows slosh water on the
fire tidy up their two grubby BOYS plump up the cushions
dump knitting under the sofa and try to smarten themselves
up all in the space of a few seconds

BROWN
Theres really no need for this

MRS GRANT
Ill not have her seeing it like it

(beat)
I know she means well but I wish
shed warn us she was coming

BROWN
She thinks if she warned you youd go
pouring water on the fire and stuffing

Growing all the time maam

MR GRANT remembers himself and gestures VICTORIA towards a
chair

MR GRANT
Will you sit maam

From his place by the wall BROWN notices how easily she
smiles as she is led to the chair She points to a picture
on the wall and her good humour is infectious

Why is the Queen penny-wise and pound
foolish Because she looks after the

A peal of naughty laughter Unseen DISRAELI steps up

men up against the stacks and hes
shouting and cursing at them Why are

you poaching on Royal land And one
of the little fellas looks up at him
and says coz weve come up in the

For a split second both the GRANTS look petrified then
BROWN and VICTORIA explode into laughter and the GRANTS
relax Suddenly the GRANTS are helpless with laughter too
Beginning with VICTORIAs glass BROWN pours out liberal
quantities of whiskey all round

VICTORIA smiles and BROWN lifts her off the trap Before
walking in she turns and in front of everyone says

he finds PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER staring back at him in
utter disbelief at what she has just said He turns and
leads the horse back to the stables

Shes drunk

PONSONBY doesnt answer He is watching BROWN very

No-one should think themselves wiser
than me

It is not for any of the Queens
subjects to presume to tell Her

INT WINDSOR CASTLE SERVANTS CORRIDOR - NIGHT

A pair of doors open out onto a torchlit driveway as a mass
of SERVANTS rush in and out ferrying bags an trunks

BROWN marches in still charged-up from the strain of the
journeys watchfulness He spots an UNDER-PORTER snatching
a break
BROWN
You Whats your business here

UNDER- PORTER
(jumping to)
Under-porter sir

BROWN
Well dont stand where you shouldnt

The UNDER-PORTER scrambles up the stairs A few SERVANTS
exchange looks BROWN seems more determined than ever to
exert his control

EXT WINDSOR CASTLE STABLES - NIGHT
That night

Carrying an old storm lamp high over his head BROWN walks
towards the stables

EXT THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - DAY
The next day

BROWN is on horseback riding with VICTORIA through the
grounds He is still jumpy eyes flicking left and right
searching for intruders They are being followed at a
distance by two EQUERRIES on horseback VICTORIA frowns
peevishly

VICTORIA
Must they always follow us

BROWN
I ordered it Its for your own
safety

VICTORIA

Dear me youll be telling me to watch
what I eat next

BROWN doesnt react A beat

VICTORIA (CONTD)
Am I not safe enough with you John

BROWN
Aye
(looking away)
But there are Fenians reported on the
mainland
VICTORIA
(tutting irritably)
The threat from the Irish is greatly
exaggerated Im sure

BROWN
(snapping back)
Ill decide when its exaggerated

BROWN chucks his horse on bringing a firm halt to the
conversation A beat He pulls up suddenly staring at
the shadows in the copse

VICTORIA
Is anything the matter John
(beat)
John

He stares for along moment and then lets it go

BROWN
Nothings the matter

INT WINDSOR CASTLE STABLES - NIGHT

BROWN marches down the line of horse boxes A stable-lad
BARNEY is feeding the horses He looks twitchy

BROWN
Hey Barney

BARNEY
Mr Brown sir --

BROWN
Its cold out there tonight Barney

Reaching his pony BROWN stops and smiles The animal
lifts its face to him and he softly strokes his muzzle

BROWN (CONTD)
Yeah theres a good girl
(to Barney)
Have you had a look at this hoof She
was limping badly I think there
might be a stone in it

BARNEY
Yeah yeah I did

BROWN
Good man And is she all right

BARNEY
Yeah

BROWN
Good Shes a good girl Arent you
Yeah shes a lovely girl And you

BARNEY

BROWN
(beat)
Are you all right Barney

BARNEY twitches again and BROWN realizes too late The
split-second he turns he sees THREE MEN

BROWN (CONTD)
Oh aye

The MEN pile onto him and he collapses under their weight

As he falls BROWN manages to yank himself round bang up a
fist and fling the others off him But the FIRST MAN is up
again twisting an arm round his neck and tugging him back
The others grapple his arms down but BROWN is incredibly
strong Even now grunting and scrabbling he makes them
fight to force him back BARNEY stands transfixed in
horror

Dumping BROWN against the wall the men step back and start
kicking the shit out of him BROWN curls into a ball jaw
locked hands over his head Not a sound

Finally they back off panting hard The FIRST MAN pulls
out a bottle of whiskey yanks back BROWNs head and forces
whiskey down his throat It spills over his face and
dribbles down his neck

moment then picks up her pen and tries to work She
cannot

INT WINDSOR CASTLE BROWNS QUARTERS - DAY

BROWN sits on the edge of the bed in only his
undergarments His face arms legs and fingers are livid
with bruises but he sits there stiff-backed and gritting
his teeth while ARCHIE crouches in front of him tending
to his wounds

BROWN
And she sent no word down

ARCHIE
They said you were drunk
(beat)
Why dont you tell her the truth

BROWN
Shell think its her fault for

ARCHIE completes one of the dressings when BROWN suddenly
reaches back and starts trying to put on his shirt

ARCHIE

BROWN

ARCHIE

BROWN lunges for the bedside drawer and pulls out a card
showing a coy picture of a pretty woman He holds it up
eyes blazing

BROWN
From the Queen

He reads out the inscription

BROWN (CONTD)

The next day VICTORIA sits at her desk PONSONBY hands
her letters to sign

PONSONBY
to be followed by a visit from
Lady Bridport She is keen to secure
a place for her niece as Maid of
Honor

VICTORIA signs the last letter and sits back

VICTORIA
I am tired

PONSONBY coughs

PONSONBY
There is one other matter

VICTORIA
What is it

PONSONBY
I have a letter maam

VICTORIA
From whom

PONSONBY
From Princess Helena and other members
of your family

VICTORIA
(stiffening defensively)
My family is quite capable of
communicating with the Queen in
person

PONSONBY does not reply Finally VICTORIA is obliged to
ask

VICTORIA (CONTD)
What do they want

PONSONBY
They are demanding the dismissal of
John Brown on grounds of drunkeness

VICTORIA stares through the window expressionless

INT WINDSOR CASTLE CHAPEL - DAY

VICTORIA walks through the ornate chapel nervously
fingering her handkerchief Waiting for her smiling
softly is the Dean of Windsor DEAN WELLSELLY

DEAN WELLSELLY
You wished to see me maam
She holds his eyes for a moment then nods
INT WINDSOR CASTLE CHAPEL - DAY

A few minutes later VICTORIA and DEAN WELLSELLY are seated
in a corner of the chapel talking softly She cannot
bring herself to look at him and so does not notice how
carefully he is watching her throughout the interview

This is incredibly hard for her to say but she struggles
to be as honest as possible

VICTORIA

My husband tried always to make me
think more subtly Of course he
taught me so much and I can never
repay my debt to him or the love I
feel even now But in truth I
think I am someone who can only feel
things while they are alive to me
For that reason I know I do not have
a subtle mind I know that But I
work hard and I try to do my duty

(she hesitates she is

struggling now)
However I have noticed of late that
my feelings of grief are not so strong

and -- that I find myself leaning more
upon the comfort of living friends
(beat)

Friends close to me now

She stops herself She is crying DEAN WELLSELLY watches
her a moment then speaks close choosing his words
carefully

DEAN WELLSELLY
Your Majesty a settled resignation is
more lasting proof of affection than
active grief If the good Lord sees
fit to bring one into contact with
congenial fellow beings one should
not analyze ones reaction too deeply
To allow oneself to be comforted by
someone else need not imply any
disloyalty to the memory of the loved
one

Silence VICTORIA stares into the long dark chapel
Gradually as she takes in the tone of his remarks her
disappointment turns to anger
INT WINDSOR CASTLE QUEENS SITTING ROOM - DAY

The next day VICTORIA stands at the far window and her
back to the room Lined up against the wall are BERTIE and
his siblings

VICTORIA
Sir Henry

PONSONBY steps forward

PONSONBY
Maam

VICTORIA
Please tell the Princess and other
signatories to this letter that the
Queen will not be dictated to or made
to alter in any way what she has
found to answer for her comfort

(beat)

Do I make myself clear

PONSONBY
Maam

A beat

VICTORIA
You may go

They all file out

EXT THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - DAY

A few days later

BROWN and VICTORIA are riding on horseback Although
better than he was BROWNS face is still badly bruised

They turn a corner banked by trees BROWN is watching the
QUEEN closely She stops

VICTORIA
I would like to get down

Without a word BROWN dismounts and helps her off her
horse

VICTORIA (CONTD)
John
A beat

BROWN
Yes maam

VICTORIA
I was told you were in a fight

BROWN
Yes maam

VICTORIA
Has someone seen to those bruises

BROWN
Yes maam

BROWN (CONTD)
Maam

VICTORIA
Yes

BROWN

Having considered my position here at
court I have come to the conclusion
that it is in the best interest of
Your Majesty that I should resign

VICTORIA
I do not accept

BROWN
I had foreseen that you would not
But Your Majesty should understand --
that my mind will not be changed in
this I leave for Deeside --

VICTORIA

(cutting in)
The Queen forbids it

(beat)
I cannot allow it because I cannot
live without you Without you I
cannot find the strength to be who I
must be Please

She takes his hand to her mouth and kisses it gently
looks at him utterly helpless

then
VICTORIA (CONTD)
Promise me you wont let them send me
back

A long silence BROWN holds her hand tight

EXT LOWLANDS - DAY
A few weeks later

A tiny horse-drawn carriage creeps across a huge Highland
landscape

DISRAELI (V0O)
Yesterday Gladstone talked for three
hours on the Irish Church Bill I
am as guilty as the rest of
underestimating his reforming zeal
Tory days may be numbered but I fancy
there yet remains one last hope of
deliverance Wheresoever the blame
lies we must now close ranks and
defend Mrs Browns England As for my
interminable journey to the land of
Calvin oatcakes and sulphur

EXT BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY
DISRAELI hurries through the pouring rain

DISRAELI (0S)
no Prime Minister made greater
sacrifice than attempting to run the
country six hundred miles north of
civilization

Reaching the castle he hurries inside and the great doors
bang behind him

INT BALMORAL CASTLE QUEENS DRAWING ROOM - DAY

The next day
QUEEN VICTORIA is playing the piano like she walks with
great vim and vigor The tune is some quaint Scottish
ballad which she belts out in her clear strong voice
almost drowning out PRINCE ARTHUR PRINCE LOUISE and PRINCE
LEOPOLD who are meant to be accompanying her They stand
in a nervous semi-circle fumbling their harmonies
Ignoring them completely VICTORIA bobs up her head with a
quizzical smile to make sure she is being appreciated

DISRAELI and the rest of the HOUSEHOLD stand a few yards
off smiling rigidly DISRAELI the consummate politician
to his inch-high insteps out-smiles the lot of them This
man is in raptures of delight And the more liquid his
smiles the happier he makes VICTORIA He beams she
belts until her children are drowned out completely

And then with characteristic suddenness VICTORIA stops
playing and launches into one of her tirades The
HOUSEHOLD wobbles in shock like children on a switch-back
but DISRAELI glides smoothly from delight to sober concern

VICTORIA
How dare the Irish break with the
Anglicans
If Albert were alive today he would
never allow the Crown to give up
Church patronage No the Irish must
be told very firmly to stay exactly
where they are It is the thin edge
of the wedge Mr Disraeli Next you
will be telling me that the Crown no
longer governs this nation

A beat A nervous silence in the Household

DISRAELI
Your Majesty remains at the very
epicenter of governance As for your
people look no further than the sales
of your Highland Journals to see in
what affection the nation holds their

Queen
(beat)
You sell even more copies than Mr
Dickens
VICTORIA

But I lack your prose Mr Disraeli

VICTORIA gives him a tiny smile DISRAELI acknowledges it
then steers the conversation back
DISRAELI
Of course I understand your concern
You miss your people
(a pause)
And they miss you

VICTORIA registers a slight flicker of defensiveness at the
implied criticism

VICTORIA
Then they may read about me

fq

DISRAELI
ndeed and for that they are
eternally grateful

VICTORIA
s that not enough

DISRAELI
n so many ways and yet it is your
presence they crave A figurehead

VICTORIA has the measure of him

VICTORIA
I never thought to be bullied by you
Mr Disraeli You I thought
understood a widows grief

DISRAELI
Forgive me maam I cannot speak for
the nation only for myself As Prime
Minister I confess I miss your
presence but that is only an
expression of my own selfish desires
and I should not burden you with it

The Household waits Has he clawed himself back VICTORIA
acknowledges his apology Her voice drops and she talks
directly to DISRAELI straight from the heart

VICTORIA
I stay here because I am happy
(beat)
Is that such a terrible crime

DISRAELI
No maam

At this moment the far door opens and BROWN walks in
BROWN
Time for your walk

Without a word VICTORIA rises from her chair and starts
following him out As they pass DISRAELI she stops

VICTORIA
This is my good John Brown

DISRAELI
(taking him in)
Yes

VICTORIA
I have asked him to show you a little
of Highland life while you are with us
at Balmoral

BROWN measures DISRAELI suspiciously

BROWN
What brings you here

DISRAELI
A man can refuse only so many
invitations from his Queen It was
remiss of me not to come earlier

VICTORIA smiles BROWN stares

BROWN
What do you know about the Highlands

DISRAELI
I am a blank sheet

BROWN
Do you hunt

DISRAELI
Occasionally

BROWN

Dare say you can be taught

DISRAELI
To shoot perhaps but not to kill

BROWN
If you hunt you kill

DISRAELI counters effortlessly
DISRAELI
Well then Ill do my best

EXT HIGHLANDS GLEN GELDER - DAY

Staying close to the ground we develop through a series of
shots showing the other highlands -- sheet rain against
heather and gorse rivulets of water slashing through mud
crude pathways sliding in wind and all ball-breakingly
cold

Coming up the hill we begin to make out a hunting party
The sound first Like a small army crashing their way up
the winding path GHILLIES urging on their horses and
dogs guns and equipment jangling off pony-hacks an then
the tall figure of JOHN BROWN striding out in front

Making no concession to anyone he force-marches them up
the hill eyes on the hunt ahead Behind them trot the men
on horseback -- DISRAELI PONSONBY BERTIE and other
GENTLEMEN each led by GHILLIES and ATTENDANTS among them
ARCHIE

Suddenly BROWN stops and raises a hand The party halts
He listens for a second Satisfied that he has found his
quarry he brings his hand down and the party of gentlemen
dismount as quietly as they can

As he waits BROWN winces slightly from the pain in his
side He pulls a flask of whiskey from his sporran and
drinks All the time DISRAELI keeps his eyes on BROWN
EXT HIGHLANDS GLEN GELDER - DAY

The stalking

Everyone is now fanned out along the hillside a ghillie to
each gentleman slowly and silently moving up the hill

DISRAELI stalks with BROWN panting hard to keep up eyes
on his man trying to make no sound

Suddenly BROWN stops Very slowly he rises DISRAELI
rides alongside and sees

A huge stag staring majestically across the hillside
Keeping his movements smooth and slow BROWN brings up his

rifle cocks it and offers DISRAELI the kill Witha
deferential gesture of the hands DISRAELI declines BROWN
stares at him a split-second raises the rifle to his
shoulder and fires

EXT HIGHLANDS GLEN GELDER - DAY

The kill

A rapid montage of guns firing as we cut to
INT BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

BROWN sweeps in from the hunt DISRAELI dripping at his
side

BROWN
(demonstrating with his
rifle)
Always remember you keep it tight to
your shoulder you absorb the kick
Aim for the head Then imagine its

DISRAELI
(smiling)
Quite

BROWN pulls out his flask and offers some to DISRAELI who
declines He watches BROWN take a long swig

INT BALMORAL CASTLE UPPER SERVANTS TABLE - NIGHT
That night

BROWN is standing at his place drinking steadily He has
a sheet of paper and a pen and is ticking off a list
Lined up in front of him trying desperately not to laugh
are five or six UPPER SERVANTS including the pretty
ASSISTANT DRESSER and BERTIES VALET They each step up
one at a time to make their report

Folding up the paper BROWN downs his glass of whiskey and
sits On his nod dinner is served by UNDER SERVANTS amid
a clatter of cutlery and chat

ARCHIE looks across at his brother but BROWN is hunched
over his plate pecking at his food

Someone titters and ARCHIE looks up BERTIES VALET
coughs BROWN slowly lifts his head His eyes have the
slightly unfocused look of too much drink It is clear to
ARCHIE that he is about to be sent-up

BERTIES VALET
(with a smug smile)
Did you see any Irish assassins today
Mr Brown

Brown doesnt react
BERTIES VALET (CONTD)
We heard the dogs were Fenian
sympathizers

Brown drinks

BERTIES VALET (CONTD)
Or was it the stag
Everyone bursts out laughing Brown slams down his glass

BROWN
Theres not a soul here cares about
that wee womans safety except me
Shed die in a ditch if I wasnt there
to look out for her --

He stops ARCHIE has come across to his brothers chair
and pulls gently on his arm

BROWN stares at the SERVANTS Everyone is about to burst
out laughing Keeping his dignity he pushes back his
chair and lets ARCHIE lead him away

As BROWN reaches the double doors the laughter hits him in
the back like a wave ARCHIE holds him steady

INT BALMORAL CASTLE BROWNS QUARTERS - NIGHT

BROWN is lying on a grubby bed ARCHIE is looking around
the untidy room For the first time he notices a thick
manuscript on the table BROWN follows his eyes

ARCHIE
Whats this

BROWN
Its a diary

ARCHIE

Be careful who sees it

BROWN
What do you take me for

ARCHIE turns back to BROWN

ARCHIE
You should have someone look after
you

BROWN

Im all right I just need to rest up
a wee bit

(feeling everything spin)

BROWN shuts his eyes and starts to drift ARCHIE watches
over him

Shes other people to look out for

(his hands come up to cover
his eyes)
How can I stop now

Dawn the next morning

BROWN is scrambling into his jacket as he hurries down the

stairs

EXT BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

BROWN crashes out of a side-door -- just fully dressed --
to be met by the smiling figure of DISRAELI

in smart walking boots

BROWN
You sent for me

DISRAELI
Ive been called back to London My
last day I thought I might take a
walk on Lochnagar

BROWN stares straight back

EXT LOCHNAGER - DAY

He is got up

plus-fours and a tweed jacket
An hour later BROWN leads DISRAELI up the hill BROWN has
his head down on with the job DISRAELI slows to a halt

DISRAELI
Princes and Lords are but the breath
of kings An honest mans the noblest
work of God
(beat)
You must miss such magnificent views

BROWN
I dont think about it

They reach the top and continue along the high ground
DISRAELI glances at BROWN and notices the limp

DISRAELI
Forgive me Ive called you out and
you should have been resting

BROWN
Im fine

DISRAELI
Youre injured

BROWN
Its nothing

DISRAELI
Still someone must attend you Your
wife should not have let you out

BROWN
Im not married

DISRAELI
(deadpan)
Oh

BROWN
This is the top

DISRAELI admires the view for a moment then continues

DISRAELI
I confess I sometimes feel as if I am
not married myself I see my wife so
little But Im forgetting the
rewards

He looks across BROWN keeps staring ahead
DISRAELI (CONTD)
The look on their faces when one walks
into the room Still gives one a
ridiculous thrill

BROWN
I wouldnt know

DISRAELI
Surely --

BROWN
(interrupts)
What I do I do for my Queen

DISRAELI
Was there never ambition

BROWN
(beat)
Maybe once

DISRAELI
Then I envy yo

BROWN
Why

DISRAELI
To have achieved ones ambition or to
have reconciled oneself to its limits
is a lifetimes work

BROWN
I do what I do

DISRAELI
For Her Majesty

BROWN
Aye

DISRAELI
But yourself
(beat)

What about John Brown

BROWN
I said
(beat)
I serve the Queen
DISRAELI
No other aspiration

BROWN stares for a long moment Finally he speaks

BROWN
To see her safe

DISRAELI steps a little closer

DISRAELI
You will not be unaware of the threat
now posed by Republicanism

BROWN
Why do you think I keep her here

DISRAELI
Ah but therein lies the paradox It
is her very isolation that encourages
the malcontents The longer she is
away the stronger they become and
who honestly can promise security
against that However many doors you
lock someone will always get in
Even here

BROWN watches him eyes alert

BROWN
So

DISRAELI
The truth is the Queen would be safer
doing her duty and returning south to
her public John Bull loves her and
John Bull is her best defense

BROWN
Her mind is set She wont change
now

DISRAELI

She trusts you John
DISRAELI is right on his shoulder now like his own voice

BROWN
They dont see it

DISRAELI
See what

tell them but they dont see it

DISRAELI
They arent as watchful as you

else has said that

BROWN
I promised to protect her from people
like you

DISRAELI
For once in my life I am not the
issue

BROWN

Shell never understand it

In time she will

BROWN
Shell think I betrayed her

But others will know that you acted
for the greater good

EXT LOCH MUICK - DAY

The next day
BROWN is rowing VICTORIA across the loch The EQUERRIES
wait on the shore

VICTORIA trails her hand in the water frowning at the
surface BROWN concentrates on the oars slipping them
carefully through the water

VICTORIA
I received a letter today from Mr
Disraeli Parliament is calling for
my return to public duties

(beat)
Why wont they let us be

BROWN does not answer

VICTORIA (CONTD)
He insists that the country expects me
to preside over the opening of the new
session I refuse to offer sustenance
to enable his weakening grip
Besides you know how much I should
hate it It frightens me

She notices that BROWN has said nothing

VICTORIA (CONTD)

BROWN does not look at her Finally

BROWN
We cant always have what we wish

VICTORIA stares at him

INT BALMORAL CASTLE QUEENS DRAWING ROOM - DAY

Later that day

VICTORIA and BROWN are in the middle of a blazing row in
front of the entire Household including PONSONBY JENNER

and LADY ELY

BROWN
If duty and safety are served by the
same end then aye I do

VICTORIA
I cannot believe you are saying this
You who I have relied on all this
time --

BROWN
(cutting in)
Have I ever let you down before--

VICTORIA
(as if he had not spoken)
-- You stand there and tell me it is
my duty after all you promised me

BROWN
Im breaking no promises

VICTORIA
You are forcing me to do the very
thing you know I fear most

BROWN
For gods sake woman Im just trying
to keep you safe

VICTORIA
I will not hear any more about my
safety You made me a promise and

now you have broken it
BROWN rounds on her deeply wounded

BROWN
-- When I took you out riding come
rain or shine because I knew it was
right for you when I kept the bairns
off your back so you could have a bit
of peace when I saw you safe from
home to home and you didnt even know
I was there All Ive ever thought
about is you

VICTORIA
Then why send me back to them

BROWN
Because I have to
(pause
Will you no listen to me woman

Face turned from him VICTORIA replies in a brittle voice

VICTORIA
Do not presume to talk to your Queen
in that manner

A long silence BROWN watches her but she will not look
at him again Finally she walks very slowly across the
room She turns in the doorway her voice faltering
slightly

A great scraping of chairs as everyone drops their forks
and stands Clearly they were not expecting her In
silence VICTORIA steps up and takes her place at the head
of the table

At last PONSONBY leans forward deferentially

PONSONBY
May I say how glad I am to see Your

VICTORIA nods then turns and looks about at the others
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA is seated at the far end of the table
VICTORIA frowns

VICTORIA
Where is my son

PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
Prince Albert is at Windsor maam

VICTORIA
Why is he not here
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA
He is sick maam

VICTORIA
Then why are you not with him

PRINCESS ALEXANDRA

VICTORIA
What is the matter with him

He has typhoid fever maam

VICTORIA stares blankly at DOCTOR JENNER

VICTORIA
No You are mistaken Prince Albert
my husband had typhoid fever I
asked what was wrong with my son

JENNER
The same your Majesty

VICTORIA stops She stares down the length of the table
A long pause

VICTORIA
Why was I not informed

I did not consider it wise in the

rushing to be ready in time

Suddenly the huge castle doors open and VICTORIA bustles

out with her entourage in tow BROWN -- only just in time
- yanks open the door for VICTORIA to step past him and
take her place She ignores him completely

BROWN slams the doors As he looks up he sees his brother
ARCHIE staring at him from across the courtyard For a
second the two brothers hold each others gaze Its
obvious that ARCHIE has noticed the Queens indifference
BROWN turns away and mounts the box as the carriage races
away under him

carriage It is time the Queen was
seen by her public

VICTORIA turns and disappears down the corridor followed
by PONSONBY We linger on BROWNS humiliation closer and
closer until

EXT WINDSOR CASTLE ST GEORGES - DAY
Some weeks later

A series of angles on BROWN as he walks amid the mass of
onlookers pressing against a cordon of guards surrounding
the cathedral All the time his eyes flick left and
right searching the faces in front of him for potential
assassins Over his intense watchfulness we hear

DEAN WELLSELLY (0S)

praise and magnify thy glorious
name for that thou has raised thy
servant Albert Edward Prince of Wales
from the bed of sickness
We pray thee to perfect the recovery
of thy servant and to crown him day by
day with more abundant blessings both
for body and soul through Jesus
Christ our Lord

The CONGREGATION mutters a vast

CONGREGATION (0S)
Amen

EXT WINDSOR CASTLE ST GEORGES - DAY

VICTORIA and other members of the ROYAL FAMILY walk down
the steps towards the cheering crowd As DEAN WELLSELLY
and BROWN follow BROWN sees ARTHUR OCONNER break from the
onlookers pulling out a gun BROWN yells out

BROWN
NO

He races toward OCONNER and hits him flying bangs him to
the ground and twists the gun out of his hand As they
fall we hear laughter and

BERTIE (0S)
So there he is Arthur OConner

INT WINDSOR CASTLE DINING HALL - NIGHT

Its a few days later and BERTIE is entertaining a private
dinner party They include QUEEN VICTORIA PRINCESS
ALEXANDRA PRINCESS LOUISE and HENRY PONSONBY BROWN is in
attendance He stands off to one side near the door

BERTIE
(bristling with confidence)
all seven stone of the man

paddling madly towards us through a
sea of Horse Guards waving something
that looks vaguely like a pen I
thought he must be one of the mothers
ardent readership in search of the
Royal indenture

More chortling VICTORIA watches her son smiling proudly
BROWN looks straight ahead

BERTIE (CONTD)
I believe I saw him first and then
alerted Brown Im not convinced that
he wasnt taking a snooze on top of
the box Anyway we had our man
pinned down and I must say Brown
acquitted himself admirably Of
course the gun was a fake but all the
same it was well done

No-one registers BROWN But while VICTORIA does not look
at him she is acutely aware of his presence

VICTORIA
I intend Brown to be rewarded with a
special medal cast in gold It will
be called The Devoted Service Medal

The guests applaud politely BERTIE clinks his glass for
attention and raises it high

BERTIE
A toast Victoria Regina

The others raise their glasses in unison

EVERYONE
Victoria Regina

VICTORIA smiles BROWN remains alone by the door

DISRAELI (0S)
The people of England have expressed
in a manner which cannot be mistaken
that they will uphold the ancient
monarchy of England

INT CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY

DISRAELI is delivering his come-back speech at a banquet of
Tory delegates

DISRAELI

If the first great object of the
Tory Party is to maintain the
institutions of the country the
second is in my opinion to maintain
the Empire of England the
hereditary the traditionary policy of
the Tory Party Go to your homes
teach them these truths which will
soon be imprinted on the conscience of
the land

FADE TO BLACK
CAPTION 1883

FADE IN
INT WINDSOR CASTLE BROWNS QUARTERS - NIGHT

The sound of rain driven hard against a window We creep
slowly down the corridor until we are back with the fifty
year-old BROWN With his whiskey for company he is
sitting at his desk writing in the diary

The diary-manuscript is now falling apart with wear but

BROWN (VO)
We should not live in expectation of
contentment Fifteen years of
vigilance will not guarantee peace of
mind Yesterday intruders were again
reported in the South Wing I believe
my prompt arrival may have averted any
crisis but it was a timely reminder
It is a great comfort to me that my
efforts in securing the Queens safety
over the years have not been in vain
Certainly Her Majesty sends me no word
that shes dissatisfied And I feel
sure that if she were unhappy she
would have found the occasion to
speak to me in person as she has so

there remain a few blank pages Slowly he fills them in

often done in the past
A knock at the door

BROWN (CONTD)
What is it

We hear a young PAGE breathless from running

PAGE
North woods sir

BROWN grabs his gun and rushes out

EXT WINDSOR CASTLE QUADRANGLE - NIGHT

BROWN appears at the door and strides into the storm He

walks quickly across the wide quadrangle

hair and clothes

rain soaking his

Two GUARDS watch BROWN as he races out into the storm

A coin flips through the air to be caught by an
outstretched hand The second GUARD grins
EXT THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - NIGHT
BROWN races across the open ground towards the forest

EXT THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE FOREST - NIGHT

And now we are back with the opening sequence Truncated
severe and shot from a slightly different angle The
driving rain BROWN hurtling through the trees the crack
to his left he spins and plunges on

EXT THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE FOREST - NIGHT

Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree heaving for
air He searches the dark stops listens and races on

EXT THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE FOREST - NIGHT

BROWN tears through the trees pistol raised at full arms
length

EXT THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE FOREST - NIGHT

He bursts into a clearing breaks to the centre and stops
Pistol raised he turns a circle eyes on the wildly
swaying trees A branch snaps behind him He spins round

bellows deep from his heart

BROWN
God save the Queen

And fires
INT WINDSOR CASTLE CORRIDOR - NIGHT
A few days later

VICTORIA is moving swiftly down a long corridor with LADY
ELY They arrive at a door VICTORIA stands facing it

VICTORIA
(quietly)

How long has he been this sick

LADY ELY
A few days maam

VICTORIA
Why was I not told earlier

LADY ELY doesnt answer VICTORIA knows anyway She nods
LADY ELY knocks The door is opened by a young UNDER
SERVANT who gawps at the sight of Her Majesty standing here
in the servants quarters VICTORIA walks in

INT WINDSOR CASTLE BROWNS QUARTERS - NIGHT

The room has been cleared of bottles but the thinness of
the life here shocks her deeply The cheap furniture the
anonymous prints the bed and finally the sight of BROWN

He is lying in bed barely conscious After a moment he
opens his eyes and stares at her She steps forward
smiling nervously

Her voice is the old voice between friends

VICTORIA
You should never have gone out in such
foul weather

BROWN
Someone has to look after you
(pause)
It couldve been someone It was
before
VICTORIA

Yes Yes it was

He cannot speak Its difficult for her too but she
speaks for him

VICTORIA (CONTD)
My Ministers are as impertinent as
ever Dispatches are now so numerous
they come in a trunk Sometimes I do
believe they will never stop Endless
letters

Her voice falters A pause

VICTORIA (CONTD)
I know I have not always been the
loyal friend you deserved John And
yet here I am now even now feeling
desperate at the thought of losing
you

She starts to cry

BROWN
Dont be silly woman

His old familiar gruffness makes her smile and she pulls
herself together Seeing a bowl of water on the side
table she steps across Carefully folding a cloth in
four she rinses it in the water and gently wipes his face
Leaning closer she is about to touch his face when BROWN
gestures protectively

BROWN (CONTD)
Not too near

INT WINDSOR CASTLE CORRIDOR - DAY

A week later PONSONBY and JENNER stand at the window
overlooking the grounds

JENNER
Erysipelas

PONSONBY
Not too protracted I hope

JENNER

(shakes his head)
A few days

(beat)
When he heard the Prince of Wales
threw the bust from the window of the
Royal Gallery It took four hours to
gather the fragments

A beat

PONSONBY
The Queen wishes to publish an account
of him

JENNER
Dear oh dear

PONSONBY
We think she can be dissuaded
(beat)
Have you had a glance at the diary

JENNER
Yes

PONSONBY
Quite
(beat)
He brings out BROWNS tatty diary-manuscript and hands it
The two men move away from the window
Daily business beckons

over to PONSONBY
to go their separate ways

JENNER

The two men head off in opposite directions down the

I think Id best take it back

JENNER
Of course

JENNER (CONTD)

PONSONBY
Some young page was boasting about
having seen it

JENNER
Well no rest for the wicked Henry
