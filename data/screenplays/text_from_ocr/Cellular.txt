TITLES OVER YELLOW BACKGROUND

We PULL BACK to reveal were looking at THE SUN In the
distance lie the gorgeous San Gabriel Mountains and the
Downtown Los Angeles skyline

In ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT we CRANE PAST some trees to reveal
the vast expansive homes scattered in the hills of Brentwood
HOMEOWNERS walk dogs a PAPERBOY chucks papers fr9m a

gleaming mountain bike Its early in the morning and the
landscapers havent come with their leaf blowers yet

CONTINUE BOOMING DOWN to road level to face the resplendent
Martin residence We STEADICAM down the fr ont walk able to
admire the manicured hedges and the black E scalade in the
driveway to the front door decorated with a whimsical
placard that reads The Martins -- and we pass THROUGH THE

KEYHOLE into the foyer

INT JESSICAS HOUSE - MORNING

We TRACK through the living room passing framed photos of an
athletic eleven year old boy and we hear a WOMANS VOICE as
she comes down the stairs with a GOLDEN RETRIEVER at her
side
WOMAN
(into phone)
Yes Donna Im out the door
We TRACK over the Womans shoulder and follow her into the
kitchen unable to see her face

WOMAN (CONTD)

Just inform Kayleigh that

anesthesia is on the way to prep

the epidural and Ill be there as

soon as I can
Still looking over her shoulder we watch her absently
straighten a PHOTOGRAPH of her son on the fridge as she
talks

WOMAN (CONTD)
And promise her shes about to have
a woooonnderful labor
As the woman pours herself a fresh cup of coffee her
HOUSEKEEPER enters the kitchen with a full laundry basket
They give each other a silent wave

WOMAN (CONTD)
Right Ill see you in twenty
She hangs up her cordless and takes a breath as we COME
AROUND to finally REVEAL JESSICA MARTIN slightly weary but
ready for the day ahead

JESSICA
Buenas dias Rosario

ROSARIO
Good morning Miss Jessica
Jessica sees her answering machine blinking hits PLAY
In the background a cheerful Rosario enters frame and heads
for the back door carrying the basket of laundry

MALE VOICE
(on machine)
Honey Honey wake up Pick up the-

And as she brings the coffee cup to her lips--

SLAMM The door EXPLODES open and a squad of FIVE GUNMEN
storm in wearing SKI-MASKS Everything is a whirlwind of
quick cuts noise and confusion

Jessicas DOG starts to lunge at the men and -- thup -- is
stilled by a silenced pistol before its second bark
Rosario runs for the ALARM SYSTEM --

LEAD GUNMAN
Get away from there Dont touch

that --
-- but as she reaches out for the PANIC BUTTON -- BLAM
blows her away too The Gunman curses then turns on
Jessica

LEAD GUNMAN (CONTD)
(dire)
Where is he
Jessica cringes

JESSICA
Where is who

LEAD GUNMAN
Wrong answer
The bastard hauls back and -- WHAM I -- punches her in the
face knocking Jessica cold
Then he turns to his men

LEAD GUNMAN (CONTD)
Search the house
And as the answering machine fills the silence

CRAIG VO
(on machine)
-Ill call back later
The LEAD GUNMAN spins around and we PUSH INTO the blackness
of his masked face

MATCH CUT TO

EXT KIDNAPPERS SAFEHOUSE - DAY

The BLACKNESS of a BLACK VAN and ESCALADE passing below us
We quickly CRANE DOWN to see the vehicles traveling through
An IRON GATE at the edge of an aband9ned property They
bounce down a long lonely driveway lined with barren trees--
ANGLE ON THE KIDNAPPERS VAN as it arrives at its
destination an isolated HOUSE in the Hills The grass is
dead The trees are dead Its the kind of place you could
scream for a week and no one would hear a thing

As the van stops--

WE PUSH INTO ITS DOORS

INT DARKENED ATTIC - KIDNAPPERS SAFEHOUSE

A door CRASHES open Light slices through the dark revealing
the dusty skeletal interior Jessica is hurled into the
room and falls to the floor With bound hands she
frantically pulls her blindfold off to see--

He
THE LEAD SKI-MASKED KIDNAPPER

Standing in front of her Sturdier than the rest Solid
Imposing
JESSICA
Wh what do you want

Unsettlingly the Kidnapper says nothing staring at her
Jessica tries to remain calm under his angry gaze

Then suddenly the Kidnapper turns and exits the room

Jessica breathes a sigh of reliefbut it catches in her
throat as he returns ten seconds later -- with a BASEBALL BAT
Grim as death he stalks toward her --

JESSICA (CONTD)
No wait
And reachingher he hauls back and SWINGS --

JESSICA (CONTD)

NO PLEASE--
SMASH The bat connects with a wooden beam an inch above
Jessicas head OBLITERATING the ROTARY DIAL TELEPHONE that
hung there
As phone guts shower down on her the Lead Kidnapper turns
and stomps away slamming the attic door shut and locking
Jessica in the darkness
Only now that theyre gone does Jessica allow her fear to
show through Trembling tears running down her face
Jessica finally breaks down pleading to the empty attic--

JESSICA (CONTD)
Wha what the hell is happening
The attics suffocating silence is the only answer she gets

DISSOLVE TO

THE OCEAN

Skimming along the water

And we TILT UP to reveal the majestic beaches of Southern
California and at the center of it all the SANTA MONICA

PIER

EXT SANTA MONICA PIER - MORNING - ESTABLISHING

It would be a typical day except for that some PEOPLE are
preparing for a HEAL THE BAY rally at the end of the pier
VENDORS set up preparing for the daily grind ahead

BIKERS gather around a bad-ass HELLCAT G2 CONFEDERATE
MOTORCYCLE and admire its cutting-edge design
HOT CHICKS in bikinis try on sunglasses at a stand
FISHERMEN crack beers while awaiting the next bite

INT SANTA MONICA PIER - ARCADE - MORNING

ANGLE ON - ARCADE GAME SCREEN

The screen displays a car-race arcade game A computer
generated hot-rod passes other racers at breakneck speed
Playing the sit-down game DAYTONA USA is

RYAN ACKERMAN early twenties looks like he grew up on the
beach without so much as a pot to piss in His lethal
reflexes and bold recklessness however have made him a Jedi
Master of the game

Ryans score approaches the HIGH SCORE at the top of the
screen

RYAN
You recording this

CHAD (OS)
Yeah sure
CHAD his best bud aims a BLUE TOOTH VIDEOSTREAMING
CELLPHONE at some CUTE GIRLS instead We can see their faces
on the tiny SCREEN of the cellphone
Ryans car gets caught behind a blue speedster then passes
on the shoulder

RYAN
Move bitch
He gets an EXTENDED PLAY and the screen flashes NEW RECORD
Nearby a KID watching the game nods

KID
Nice
The HIGH SCORE starts rising to match Ryans score

RYAN
Get that
Ryan turns around to see Chad has shoved the cellphone down
the front of his tattered shorts And hes freeballing it

CHAD
Check it Attack of the Bubblegum
Monster in Hi-Def videostream-

RYAN
Cmon Chad I gotta put my mouth on
that
Holding a cup of soda between his teeth Chad pulls the
cellphone out of his pants and hits SEND
CHAD
(through cup-holding
teeth)
Sweet Its going to my email
right now
S9me soda inadvertently SPILLS onto the cellphone and Chad
wipes it dry on his pants

RYAN

Watch it dude I gotta return that
thing in seven days

CHAD
They arent giving you shit yet

RYAN
Nah whenever I return it I just
list off why the phone sucks and
they give me a new model Figure
by the tenth time Ill have to go
somewhere else

Ryans car finally CRASHES in a wall of flames Game Over
CUT TO

THE OCEAN

As seen looking over the rail of the pier The tide is in

but its still a forty foot drop

RYAN stares over the railing like a death row inmate
contemplating his last meal

CHAD
Go already No ones looking
His left hand holds his WALLET

CHAD (CONTD)
(re wallet)
Need me to hold that
Ryan sticks it in the pocket of his surfer shorts -- he zips
a zipper tucks a Velcro flap Pats his pocket proudly

RYAN
Waterproof
But as soon as Ryan covertly CLIMBS ONTO THE RAIL his left
leg starts trembling like crazy

RYAN (CONTD)
This is stupid I could get
killed Pick another dare
Chad lowers the phone irritated

CHAD
My ass Not after you made me
march in the Gay Pride Parade
wearing a thong

RYAN
Screw it then In one Two
Two and a half--

CHAD
Whole numbers only Rabbitfoot
Ryan stares at the waves crashing below His leg starts
snaking like crazy And he chickens out hopping back to
the deck

CHAD (CONTD)
Just so you know Im emailing this
to every chick you ever met
But suddenly Ryans oblivious to the dare His eyes are
glued to something else--

CHAD (CONTD)

(speaking like HAL 900)

Transmitting pussy file now
CHLOE early 20s a head turner confident funny she can
pull you in like a tractor beam She and some CUTE FRIENDS
carry heavy cardboard boxes toward a table set up for the
Heal The Bay rally
Ryan walks over like he owns the place

RYAN

CHLOE

RYAN

Chloe opens the box Hands him a Heal The Bay pamphlet

RYAN (CONTD)
Cool youre handing these out

Ryan tries to ignore his thundering heart
RYAN
Hell yeah Im all about Heal the
Bay
His eyes ricochet off the pamphlet in his hand

RYAN (CONTD)
Me an Chad do the monthly cleanup
thing of course
An awesome wing-man Chad appears over Chloes shoulder
pretending to read a pamphlet but really holding it up so
Ryan can see it Piece of cake now

RYAN (CONTD)
Weve collected water samples with
the Stream Team raised money on
the Promenade Im surprised I

He offers his hand

RYAN (CONTD)
Ryan

CHLOE

The handshake lingers a second longer than necessary and
they both smile at each other Chad splits

CHLOE (CONTD)

Ryan stops posturing gets real

RYAN

RYAN (CONTD)

Ryan makes a graceful exit Turns back
RYAN

CHLOE

Ryan grabs Chad and as they walk out of earshot

RYAN
Dude does Santa Barbara have a
harbor or a pier

CUT TO

EXT VENICE - DAY
A short time later Ryan cruises through a Venice
neighborhood

Ryan drives an early 70s Ford Bronco clothes are strewn
across the backseat and a box of Heal the Bay T-SHIRTS now
sits on the shotgun seat

Ryan reaches into the glove box and pulls out a toothbrush
He sips warm soda from a bottle and begins brushing

Checking himself out in the mirror he sniffs his pits whoa
and grabs the cellphone
RYAN
(into phone)

drives under an OVERPASS
Suddenly --
The car ahead of him STOPS in the middle of the street Ryan

nightmare --
OFFICERS manhandle a drunk toward the back a HOOKER screams

at us with unholy rage in the far corner a JUNKIE spits on

an OFFICERS FACE and theres a lethal race for disinfectant
through invisible soup

Sounds are distant eerily muffled A HIGH-PITCHED WHINE
lets us know were in hell
CLOSE UP BOB MOONEYS EYES Concerned but not panicked

MOONEYS POV Still surreal SLOW-MOTION as an Officer with

a CREWCUT responds by spinning the Junkies face into a wall
legal but hard

SFX A HEARTBEAT OURS FAST And possibly IRREGULAR
CLOSE UP - SLOW MOTION - The RIGHT THUMB presses into the

LEFT WRIST

Gangbanger back over to the holding cells
Mooney puts down the pizza no appetite and stares at the
news story playing on the TV mounted in the corner

ON THE TELEVISION
a NEWS REPORTER is in the middle of a segment Over him
FOOTAGE rolls of six guilty-looking cops testifying in court

being led away in handcuffs

NEWS REPORTER
was somber when the indictments
came down this afternoon in the

Though the names of six police
officers were read aloud the
District Attorney stated that this
was merely the tip of the iceberg
and that unfortunately many other
arrests are likely to be coming as
the investigations proceed

2 BACK TO POLICE STATION 22
As DETECTIVE JACK TOMLIN passes Mooney he nods toward the TV

todays bizarre string of crimes

Cadillac at gunpoint

MOONEY

Mooney watches as they continue to detail Ryans wild crime
spree but gets the bigger picture realizing that every
event --the Verizon store searching for the Martin kid

stealing the Cadillac -- centers around the cellphone call

Mooney listens intently -- and is troubled
MOONEY

The woman at the house didnt have

an accent
Marilyn smiles realizing hes really talking to himself
Mooney hangs up thoughts racing He reaches behind him and
without looking he grabs his wallet and keys
He then walks over to Marilyn and kisses the top of her head
She knows him and knows somethings up

MOONEY (CONTD)

INT FEGAN SECURITIES INC - THIRD FLOOR - DAY

Dripping with sweat Ryan shambles out of the stairwell the
bike helmet now strapped to his head and the pouch over his

shoulder -- just as the ELEVATOR ARRIVES behind him

As Greer Hodges and Craig get out Ryan turns and searches

for the mailroom thats supposed to be here Where the hell

is-- Ah I He finds it and hustles into --

INT MAILROOM - CONTINUOUS

A wide COUNTER separates Ryan and a few BUSINESS MEN and
WOMEN from the MAIL CLERKS that busily work the other side
Ryan leans against the wall pretending to be an ordinary
bike messenger waiting for a package as Craig and the dirty
cops enter brushing right past him

Craig scans the faces of the other patrons as they enter
desperately trying to figure out who is his secret ally He
ignores Ryan completely whose face is mostly hidden by the
tinted plastic VISOR attached to the helmet

Craig notices an AGING SECURITY GUARD stationed in the area
but knows better than to make any waves

MAILROOM SUPERVISOR
(recognizing Craig)
Anything I can help you with Mr
Martin

CRAIG
Hey Benny This might sound
ridiculous but I dropped a DVD
mailer into the chute this morning
and I forgot to put down an

MAILROOM SUPERVISOR

whats back there Gimme a sec’
The Supervisor disappears into the back room
Greer and Hodges take a seat only a few feet away from Ryan
The moment is uncomfortableand gets infinitely worse as--

MAIL CLERK

Ryan turns realizing with horror that another MAIL CLERK is
speaking to him

RYAN

Theres an entire shelf that serves as a dead letter office
One plastic bin is filled with reusable interoffice
envelopes another bin is overflowing with small mailers
computer disks unlabeled video tapes Etc

MAILROOM SUPERVISOR
Help yourself
HODGES cautiously watches Craig shuffle through the mailers
opening two or three before finding -- he turns one upside
down -- and a DVD case slides out
A quick glance at the label ADT Digital Surveillance’
51905 0600 - 0700 confirms its the disc

Hodges seems uncomfortable with the Supervisor hovering over
his shoulder

HODGES
Lets go

BACK TO
INT MAILROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ryan now sits by the window cellphone pressed to his ear
Feigning frustration

RYAN
You believe this Everyones got
their head up their ass over there
The Mail Clerk ignores him almost as much as Greer wants to
Greer opens his cellphone to make a call but when the signal
is no good he wanders outside the mailroom toward the window
at the end of the hall

MAIL CLERK
(impatiently)
Sir You think you could just go
outside and get your clipboard
Just then Hodges and Craig come marching out of the vault

MAIL CLERK (CONTD)
Sir
Ryan glances at Greer momentarily distracted on the phone
At Hodges almost out of the bank As he and Craig near the
door --

A moment where Craig finally locks eyes with Ryan -- and
suddenly realizes This is the guy
Its now or never Ryan has to do something

MAIL CLERK (CONTD)
Sir

RYAN

(to Clerk)
Screw the package
Ryan stands and unable to find anything better snatches a
metal HAND TRUCK sitting by the door and as Hodges walks by--

MAIL CLERK

WHAT ARE YOU DOING--
-- swings it full-force into Hodges face -- WHAMM Hodges
drops like a slaughterhouse cow
Instantly employees hit the ground scream run for their
lives Craig dives for the DVD case The Security Guard has
come to life drawing down on them

Peeking over the edge from the floor above--

Footsteps are approaching POUNDING on the door Ryan darts
behind a tarp-covered mass of supplies just as --

leads from the roof and elbows down toward a DUMPSTER on

Greer peers down the chute for long secondsbut nothing can
be seen from this angle It all falls to blackness

Greer cocks his head in the sudden eerie silence The only
sounds are INCOHERENT SCREAMS coming from the stairwell He

JESSICA - IN THE ESCALADE

She TWISTS the key and STOMPS the gas sending the monster
SUV on a collision course with -- SMASHHH -- the guest house
window The bay window SHATTERS and the security bar SNAP
LIKE TWIGS as the Escalade BULLDOZES through

Unable to open the door because of all the debris Jessica
rolls down the window and yells to her son --

- JESSICA
Ricky Come on
-- but hes frozen in fear at all the noise and dust He

shakes his head No

JESSICA (CONTD)
Baby please Its okay now
Were gonna go home
(glances back nervously)

Ricky please
Somehow the kid digs deep and finds the courage to run to
the Escalade where his mother scoops him up into the cab
just as--
The kitchen door bursts open and Greers team spills out into
the yard They spot her instantly

ELLIS
Get out of the car Get out of the

And just as it finally comes loose -- KRRRAAASHHH

The window next to Jessicas head EXPLODES in a shower of
tempered glass shocking us Two arms snake in and wrap
around Jessicas neck Greer

But Jessica STOMPS ON THE GAS hoping the big car will pull
her free

It doesnt As the Escalade surges away across the lawn
Greers vice-like grip holds PULLING JESSICA OUT the broken
window and -- THUMP -- to the guest house debris below

As Jessica watches in horror

THE DRIVERLESS ESCALADE
Careens down the driveway and crashes into a pillar Hodges
