Last Stage to Red FoeK
CUT FROM BLACK TO

70mm SUPERSCOPE WIDESHOT OF WYOMING
EXT —- WHITE WINTER WYOMING MOUNTAIN RANGE -— SNOWY DAY

A breathtaking 70MM filmed (as is the whole movie) snow covered
mountain range

A staggering opening vista set to appropriately nerve jangling
music

Then in the bottom left of this big 70MM SUPER CINEMASCOPE FRAME
we see a STAGECOACH being pulled by a team of SIX HORSES rip
snorting through the bottom of the landscape

Setting is an undetermined time six or eight or twelve years
after the Civil War

cuT TO
EXT - STAGECOACH (MOVING) - SNOWY DAY Now still in big super CINEMASCOPE 70MM filmed gioriousness we
follow along with the lone STAGECOACH DRIVER fighting and guiding
these six horses to shelter

We follow alongside the HORSES working our way from the back
horse in mid-stride to the tip of the lead horses nose

We follow along the twelve horse hooves as they tear up and spit
out snow and dirt

We take the DRIVERS POV down the hurtling six horse team

We follow along the big stagecoach WAGON WHEEL then up to the
stagecoach door WINDOW (complete with curtains) Which beyond we
can make out the figures of a MAN and a WOMAN sitting side by
side

70MM CU of The STAGECOACH DRIVER 0B (pronounced Obie) as he
whips the horses forward keeps the wheels on the road and avoids
the rocks

-he sees something up ahead
He pulls back on the reins

CU HORSE MOUTH
as reins are pulled back

Their HOOVES
slowing in the snow

oB
still fighting the reins

The HORSES
still trying to stop their vigorous glide Snorting and coughing
HOT BREATH the horses finally settle to a stop

OB
calms the halted horses as he looks straight ahead and down at Q)
the impediment to his vehicles progress

OBs POV

What 0B sees on the road is a BLACK MAN in the middle of it
sitting on a nice leather saddle laid on top of THREE FROZEN DEAD
WHITE MEN smoking a pipe (the black man not the three dead white
guys)
The BLACK MAN
removes the pipe from his mouth and says to the man behind the six
snorting horses

BLACK MAN
Got room for one more

0B

looks at the black man sitting on the three dead white men in the
middle of the road smoking a pipe amongst falling snowflakes
and says

OB
Who the hell are you and what happened
to them

The BLACK MAN is an older man A sly LEE VAN CLEEF type with a
bald pate silver hair on the sides a distinguished mustache and
a tall slim frame He wears the dark blue uniform pants of the
US CAVALRY with the yellow stripe down the side of the pant
leg tucked into black regulation Cavalry riding boots His shirt
and undergarments are non regulation and worn for comfort style
and warmth including a long charcoal grey wool scarf But his
dark heavy winter coat is his OFFICER WINTER COAT from the US
Cavalry with the officer insignias ripped off

On top of his bald pate he wears a supercool non regulation COWBOY
HAT he picked up sometime after the war

The NORTHERN OFFICER says

MAJOR MARQUIS WARREN
Names Major Marquis Warren former US
Cavalry Currently Im a servant of the
court

The northern Officer stands up from his saddle perch on the three
frozen dead white men

MAJOR MARQUIS WARREN (CONTD)
These are a coupla no-goods Im bringin’
into market I got the paperwork on ‘em
in my pocket

OB-

MAJ WARREN
I figure thats where you goin right

We see a terrible BLIZZARD kicking up in the BACKGROUND The
stagecoach has obviously been trying to beat it to shelter
OB

ass for the last three hours Aint no

MAJ WARREN

OB

in the wagon paid for a private trip

And Im here to tell ya he paid a pretty
penny for privacy So if you wanna go

to Minnie’s with us you gotta talk
to him

MAJ WARREN
Well I suppose 111 do that

MAJOR MARQUIS WARREN starts to walk around to the stagecoach door
when a rifle barrel comes out of the window pointing at the former
Cavalry officer

We hear a HAMMER CLICK
The VOICE BEHIND THE RIFLE yells out

VOICE BEHIND THE RIFLE (0S)
Hold it black fella

Marquis Warren stops
VOICE BEHIND THE RIFLE (0S)
(CONT)
Fore you approach you take them two
guns of yours and lay ‘em on that rock
over yonder Then you raise both your
hands way above your hat Then you come
forwardmolasses-like

Maj-Warren looks up at OB and says
MAJ WARREN
(to 0B)
Real trustin fella huh
OB
(to MajWarren)
Not so much
MajWarren walks over to the rock that the voice behind the rifle
chose as a good place for Marquis to relieve himself of his
weapons
He places two revolvers hanging on his hip on said rock

Then raising his hands above his hat he slowly approaches the
stagecoach

We see a bit of a face and a hat in the dark beyond the window
frame in the stagecoach door

The voice behind the rifle snaps

VOICE BEHIND THE RIFLE (0S)
Thats far enough

The Major stops
The rifle barrel is taken inside the window
Then

--the fella’ in the wagon KICKS OPEN the stagecoach door so
MajWarren can see inside

The FELLA IN THE WAGON is a rough looking white man lawman type
with a drop dead black hat and a walrus like mustache above his
top lip

He one arms a rifle in MajWarrens direction

The other arm is handcuffed to the wrist of

The FEMALE PASSENGERPRISONER in the stagecoach with him

She sits across from him her wrist cuffed to his wrist his
cuffed hand holding a pistol the pistol pointed at her belly

Oy
This once pretty WHITE LADY (maybe before the trip maybe years
ago) wears a once pretty dress and a once sexy smirk under a
mans heavy winter coat Her face is a collection of cuts bruises
and scrapes As if during this trip with The Walrus Mustache Man
she took a few punches and falis

The WALRUS MUSTACHE MAN says

THE WALRUS MUSTACHE MAN
Well Ill be dogged you a black fella’

MAJ WARREN

MAJ WARREN

John Ruth makes the introductions

JOHN RUTH

MajWarren

While keeping his hands raised MajWarren touches the brim of
his hat and nods slightly in her direction

DAISY DOMERGUE (pronounced DAHMER-GOO) gives Maj-Warren an open
handed wave with her free hand and says with a smile

DOMERGUE
Howdy nigger

That makes John Ruth chuckle and Maj Warren frown

JOHN RUTH

(to Maj-Warren)

dead white guys)

MAJ WARREN

Rebel Roy McCrackin

JOHN RUTH

molasses-like

MajWarren slowly removes the handbills from his winter coat
pocket

John Ruth lowers his rifle from MajWarrens chest and takes the
papers to study He removes from his pocket a pair of spindly gold
framed reading glasses that he applies to his face

0OB up on his drivers seat perch yells back at them

OB

(yelling)
Look I sure hate to interrupt yall
But we gotta’ cold damn blizzard hot on
our ass we tryin to beat to shelter
JOHN RUTH

(yelling back)
I realize that Now shut your mouth and
hoid them damn horses while I think

The grizzled guy studies the handbills

Then raises both of his eyes and the brim of his hat to study the
black Major still standing with his hands raised

John Ruth makes up his mind

JOHN RUTH
Okay boy well give it a try- But you
leave those pistols over yonder with
the driver

Daisy Domergue says

DOMERGUE
You aint really gonna let that nigger
in here is ya I mean maybe up there
with 0B but not in here -

John Ruth takes the pistol in his cuffed hand switches it to his
free hand and brings the iron weapon down hard on the side of
Daisys skull with a sickening CRACKING SOUND This knocks the
woman onto the floor of the stagecoach on her hands and knees
Blood trickles from her hair and runs down the side of her face

John Ruth leans his big hulking frame over her on the stagecoach
floor and says with real grit

JOHN RUTH
How you like the sound of them bells

From the floor Domergue says

DOMERGUE

Domergue looks up at the brute with hate flashing in her eyes

Daisy looks at Ruth she couldnt hate him more

JOHN RUTH

DOMERGUE

Major Warren LAUGHS
Daisys eyes flash across the wagon over to the black man
She couldnt hate John Ruth more
That is unless he was a laughing nigger
Then in that case maybe she could hate him more
They ride along quiet for a bit when John Ruth asks MajWarren
JOHN RUTH
(to Maj -Warren)

envelope

John Ruth puts on his spindly reading glasses
7

-»-then carefully opens up the letter from its folded
position

--then hands the open letter to John Ruth
Daisy Domergue has no idea whats up with this letter

JOHN RUTH READS

John Ruth turns to Domergue and holds out the letter in front of
her

JOHN RUTH
You know what this is tramp Its a
letter from Lincoln Its a letter from
Lincoln to him

(pointing at

Maj -Warren)
They shared a correspondence during the
war They was pen pals This is just one
of the letters

Daisy Domergue looks over at the letter with interest
THEN

HOCKS UP A LOOGIE
and SPITS it on the letter with a BIG SPLAT
This shocks both MajWarren and John Ruth

MAJWARREN SLAMS his FIST into the right side of DOMERGUES
FACEso hardhe ends up punching her into the stagecoach
door with such forceIT FLIES OPENand DOMERGUE TUMBLES OUT
of the six horse pulled vehiclethe handcuff chain taking JOHN
RUTH WITH HERas well as the Lincoln letterand John Ruths
rifle

EXT - STAGECOACH ROAD - SNOWY DAY

Daisy Domergue and John Ruth go flying out of the speeding wagon
tumbling and somersaulting in the snow

OB pulls up on the reins yelling at the ponies bringing the
fast steeds to a slushy stop

John Ruth lies in the snow still chained to the dazed Domergue
holding his arm in pain

JOHN RUTH

(cursing at

the cold)
-0f all the stupid - like to rip my
goddamn arm off

MajWarren climbs out of the stopped vehicle

John Ruth takes out a SMALL KEY and for the first time in the
story UNLOCKS the handcuffs that tie him to his female prisoner

For the momentboth John Ruth and Daisy Domergue are free

He doesnt want to unchain Domergue but his arm hurts like the
dickins and he has to walk it off

Daisy Domergue spits some blood from her mouth into the snow She
touches her freed wrist She watches John Ruth walk off the pain
in his shoulder Awww he hurt his arm aint that too bad she
thinks to herself

Maj-Warren looks for his Lincoln letter
John Ruth yells at the Union Officer
JOHN RUTH
I didnt drag her stinkin’ ass up this

goddamn mountain just for you to break
her neck on the outskirts of town
MAJ WARREN
You the one handed her my goddamn letter
I didnt give it to her I gave it to you

JOHN RUTH
Okay its both of our faults

MajWarren gives him a look Then goes back to looking for his
special presidential correspondence

John Ruths arm feels a little better He picks up the fallen
rifle and approaches Domergue

With bloody teeth Domergue looks up at Ruth and says

DOMERGUE
That nigger like to bust my jaw

JOHN RUTH

You ruin that letter of his that niggers
gonna stomp your ass to death And when
he do Im gonna sit back on that wagon
wheel watch and laugh

Maj-Warren finds the letter

Its worse for the wear but still intact

John Ruth calls to him

JOHN RUTH
How is it

MAJ WARREN
She didnt help it none But its
alright

MajWarren puts the Lincoln letter back in its envelope then puts
the envelope back in the pocket of his winter jacket

Then the colored Union Officer scoops up a handful of snow and
crafts a snowball He looks at Domergue

She looks at him

DOMERGUE
Is that the way niggers treat their
ladies

MAJ WARREN

You aint no lady

MajWarren throws the snowball in her face and trods off
John Ruth looks down at her

JOHN RUTH
Youre about one wise word from being tied
up on the roof with them other fellas
Now pick your trash ass up and haul it
back in that coach Open your mouth again

last set of handcuffs from off his belt and tosses them in the
snow at Chris’ feet

JOHN RUTH (CONTD)
Put them on and come inside

Chris Mannix bends down and picks up the handcuffs at his feet
He examines them in his hand

Then he tosses them back inside the stagecoach they land on the
wood floor with a LOUD THUMP

CHRIS
No

JOHN RUTH
Then youll freeze

CHRIS
Then youll hang

JOHN RUTH
How so

CHRIS

(to 0B)
Driver Could you come down here and
join us

0B climbs down off his perch and joins the conversation

CHRIS

(to 0B)
You heard me tell this fella’ Im the
new sheriff of Red Rock right

OB

CHRIS
Red Rock is my town now And Im gonna’
enter my town in bounty hunters chains
No sir Sorry bushwackers I aint

(to 0B)
When you finally get to Red Rock youre
going to realize every goddamn thing I
said was right And I expect you OB
to tell the townsfolk of Red Rock that
John Ruth let their new sheriff freeze
to death

(to John Ruth)
There aint no bounty on my head
bushwacker You let me die thats
murder

Chris Mannix just said a mouthful A mouthful John Ruth chews in
silence

The bounty hunter other bounty hunters call The Hangman makes up
his mind He turns to MajWarren

JOHN RUTH
(to MajWarren)
Hold out your hands

John Ruth takes a TINY KEY out of his inside vest pocket and
unlocks the black mans handcuffs

Every time John Ruth takes out that key Domergue clocks it

JOHN RUTH
(to 0B)
OB give the Major back his iron
(to the Major)
One thing I know is this niggerhatin
son of a gun aint partnered up with

thousand you help me protect my ten deal

They shake hands

CHRIS
Aint love grand Yall wanna lie
on the ground and make snow angels
together

JOHN RUTH
OB I said give the Major back his
iron

0B leans in the wagon and hands the Major his two pistols back

The black man puts one back in its holster and the other he rests
lazy on his lap

Chris Mannix enters the coach and sits in the space next to
Maj -Warren

Before he climbs back up on his perch 0B closes the stagecoach
door and says to the passengers through the window

OB
From here on end no more stops or aint
none of us gonna make it to Minnies

0B disappears from the window back up on his perch on the
drivers seat He WHIPS the SIX HORSES TO LIFE and the whole wagon
RUSHES AWAY

INT - STAGECOACH (MOVING) - DAY MAJOR MARQUIS WARREN and CHRIS MANNIX
sit side by side across from JOHN RUTH and DOMERGUE

Chris Mannix looks at the outdoors speeding by the little window
in the stagecoach door

CHRIS
Phew doggie That was a close one
There were a few hours there I didnt
really know fer sure

He lets out a LOUD REBEL YELL

CHRIS

(CONT)
Good god almighty its good to be alive

CHRIS -
Well MrRuth you sound like you got a

axe to grind against The Cause
JOHN RUTH
The cause of a renegade army
A bunch of losers gone loco you bet I do
Ya wrapped yourselves up in the Rebel Flag
as an excuse to kill and steal

to MajWarren)

And this should interest you Warren
imparticular emancipated blacks

DOMERGUE
Sounds like my kinda fella’

Chris says to John Ruth

Chris shuts up
For a moment

Then he turns to

Major Warren ans

Chris looks over

CHRIS
Sounds to me you been readin a lotta’
newspapers printed in Washington DC
(beat)
AnywhoIm just tryin to let yall
know how grateful I am I was a goner
and yall saved me

JOHN RUTH
You wanna’ show me how grateful you
areshut up

Maj-Warren and asks quietly

CHRIS
(pointing at
John Ruth)
Does he know how famous you once was

wers him quietly

MAJ WARREN
I dont think so

at Domergue

CHRIS
(meaning MajWarren)
Do you know who he is

DOMERGUE
Do I know about the thirty thousand
dollar reward the Confederacy put on the
head of Major Marquis I had kin at
Wellenbeck Yeah I know about Major
Marquis and his head

al
D2

John Ruth looks to MajWarren
Chris explains to John Ruth

CHRIS
For hillbillies the head of Major Marquis
was a new farm or a ranch or a business
Or twelve good horses the kind you could
start a proper stable with A herd of
long horns and a prize bull

(to MajWarren)
Them hillbiliies went nigger head hunting
but they never did get em the right
nigger head did they

MAJ WARREN
No they didnt But it wasnt for lack
of tryin’ Them peckawoods left their
homes and their families and came to
this snowy mountain lookin for me and
fortune None of them found fortune
The ones aint no one heard of no more
found me

CHRIS

(to John Ruth)
Now it didnt stay thirty thousand the
length of the war Once passions had
cooled it dropped down to eight then
five

(to MajWarren)
What was it at wars end

MAJ WARREN
At wars end There was still a regiment
of Alabama veterans offering eight
hundred dollars

CHRIS
But I bet even when it was five you had
your share of country boys comin to call

MAJ WARREN
You know I did

JOHN RUTH
Why did they have a reward on you

MAJ WARREN
The Confederates took exception to my
capacity for killing them After I broke
out of Wellenbeck The South took my
continued existence as a personal
affront So The Cause put a reward on

my head
JOHN RUTH
Whats Wellenbeck

CHRIS
You aint never heard of Wellenbeck
prisoner of war camp West Virginia

JOHN RUTH

No Reb I aint never heard of it
(to MajWarren)

You bust out

MajWarren nods his head Yes

CHRIS
Oh MajMargquis did more than bust out
MajMarquis had a bright idea So bright
you hafta wonder why nobody never thought
about it before

(to Maj-Warren)
Tell John Ruth your bright idea

MAJ WARREN
Well the whole damn place was just made
of kindling

(beat)
So I burnt it down

CHRIS

(to John Ruth)
There was a rookie regiment spendin the
overnight in the camp Forty-seven men
---burnt to a crisp Southern youth
farmers sons cream of the crop -

MAJ WARREN

to Chris)
- And I say Let ‘em burn Im suppose to
apologize for killin Johnny Reb You
fought the war to keep niggers in chains
I fought the war to kill White Southern
Crackers And that means kill em anyway
I can Shoot em Burn ‘em Drown ‘em
Drop a big ole rock on their head
Whatever it takes to put White Southern
Crackers in the ground thats what I joined
the war to do and thats what I did

CHRIS

(to John Ruth)
To answer your question John Ruth when
Major Marquis burned forty seven men
alive for no more a reason then to
give a nigger a run for the trees thats
when The South put a reward on the head
of Major Marquis

MAJ WARREN

(to Chris)
And I made them trees Mannix And you
best believe I didn’t look back neither
Not till I passed The Northern Line

CHRIS
(to MajWarren)
But you had a surprise waitin for you
on The Northern Side didnt ya
(to John Ruth)
See once they started pullin out ali the
burnt bodies at Wellenbeck seems not
all of them boys were Rebs

ON THE SOUNDTRACK in the BG we hear the sounds of a RAGING
FIREthen we hear the SCREAMS and CRIES of MEN and HORSES
burning alive underneath Chris dialogue

CHRIS

(to Maj -Warren)
Burnt up some of your own boys didnt
ya Major How many burnt prisoners they
end up findin Wasnt the final Yankee
death count somethin like thirty-seven

The Fire and Screams FADE OUT

MAJ WARREN
Thats the thing about war Mannix
people die

CHRIS
Ahhhh so ya chalkin it up to
War IS Hell aye Well admittedly thats
a hard argument to argue with But if
memory serves your side didnt look at
it that way I think they thought
thirty-seven white men for one nigger
wasnt so hot a trade

crime

MAJOR WARREN

JESUS FACE
An extreme close up of a HANDCARVED WOOD FACE OF JESUS CHRIST

We start on Jesus’ Face and SLOWLY ZOOM OUTto reveal a very
old statue Its a handcarved wood Jesus on a HAND CHISELED STONE
CROSS stuck in the snow The statue looks like it was there
hundreds of years before the pilgrims Its as if The Vikings
marched up a mountain in Wyoming chiseled a cross out of stone
carved a figure of the saviour out of a log planted it in the
snow then sailed back to Norway The aesthetics of the statue
reveal a Slavic origin The Jesus figure with its skinny pointy
physique looks more like a crucifixion of Eisensteins Ivan The
Terrible than the hippy saviour of catholicism

But the number one thing the audience will notice about the
statue is an entire snowbank has built up on the longways section
of the cross As well as two snow piles One sitting on top of
the cross And the other sitting on top of Jesus head

0B and the six horse team come whizzing by kicking up dirt and
snow as it whooshes by the cross and the 70mm CAMERAS

EXT - MINNIES HABERDASHERY - DAY i

The six horse team stagecoach pulls up to the front of the log
built building thats known as MINNIES HABERDASHERY”

On the outside Minnies just looked like a slightly bigger than
normal stagecoach stopover parked halfway up a mountain Thats
because despite local reputation thats what it is If serving
two bottles of Tequila one bottle of Mezcal and one bottle of
Brandy qualifies you as a bar it’s a bar If serving stew
qualifies you as a restaurant its a restaurant

It sells a few hats gloves and snowshoes for the stagecoach
passengers And supplies for the mountain folk And it receives
special packages for people in Red Rock Like say when Carlos
Robante (Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez) in Rio Bravo buys those red
bloomers for his wife Consuela (Estelita Rodriguez) but doesnt
want everybody in town to know about it If he lived in Red Rock
hed buy them through the mail have them sent to Minnies and
when they arrived Minnie would get word to him and hed ride out
there and pick them up Minnies was also a good place to hold up
during a storm This wasnt the first time a group of passengers
from the stage had to sit out the snow Minnie and her partner
Sweet Dave also traded goods In fact the only stuff in their
store of any interest is the stuff they acquired in trade If that
makes them a trading goods store then theyre a trading goods
store

Minnies Haberdashery is a lot of things but the one thing it
wasnt was a haberdashery

0B brings the horses to a stop He sees something
ANOTHER STAGECOACH horses put away off to the side

OBs first thought is theres already people here His second
thought is thats strange

He looks around
The storm has gotten uglierthe wind more brutal

He sees the outside of Minnies he looks at the barn the
outhouse The field of white snow surrounding it It looks like
Minnies but it looks a little spooky But this storm is spooky
so 0B caulks up his feelings to that

And into this spooky storm A MAN in a big winter coat and hat comes
out of Minnies front door and walks towards the stagecoach

Just as he gets closer the passengers inside open the shades on the
windows of the carriage door The man sees its four passengers
sitting inside
This seems to startle him

He shoots off to speak with 0OB

INT STAGECOACH (STILL) - DAY
All four passengers saw the mans reaction

CHRIS
He didnt look that happy to see us

John Ruth staring at Minnies building says
JOHN RUTH

I think hes already got em some
customers

EXT - MINNIES HABERDASHERY - DAY

The Man in the winter coat moves over to 0Bs perch on the wagon

MAN

(speaking with

a Spanish accent)
What the hells going on we werent
expecting another stage tonight

Referring to the other stagecoach

OB

I can see you already got another one

up here

MIN

I just got through putting the horses

away

The storm is really getting going now So much so people have to

yell to be heard

OB

This aint the normal line But we are
stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard
so it looks like youre stuck with us

Are Minnie and Sweet Dave inside

MAN

They aint here Im running the place

while theyre gone
John Ruth steps out of the stagecoach into the cold dragging
Domergue along with him

He says as both MajWarren and Chris Mannix climb out of the

stagecoach

JOHN RUTH
Wheres Minnie and Sweet Dave

OB
He says they aint here Hes lookin
after the place while they gone

JOHN RUTH
(to 0B)
They aint here
(to Man)
-where are they
mil
Theyre visiting Minnies mother
JOHN RUTH
Her mother Who are you
MAN
Im Bob
JOHN RUTH

So youre lookin after the place
while Minnies away

BOB
Si

JOHN RUTH
Coffy in there

BOB
Si

JOHN RUTH

Well whoever you are help 0B with
the horses Get em outta this cold
before the blizzard lands on our heads

BOB
I just put those other horses away
You need it done fast you need to help

JOHN RUTH
I got two of my best men on it

U2

JOHN RUTH
(to the
two men)
Okay freeloaders get to work

John Ruth YANKS Domergue away towards the front door of Minnies
when suddenly his arm is YANKED BACK

He looks down and sees Domergue has stopped and squatted in the
snow to take a pee

She looks up at him

DOMERGUE
Youd let a horse piss wouldnt ya

Okay maybe shes got a point He lets Domergue take her pee

INT MINNIES HABERDASHERY - DAY We focus in on the front door of Minnies Haberdashery and only
the front door

We hear John Ruth outside trying to open the door but its
nailed shut

Then we hear PEOPLE INSIDE THE ROOM YELL OFF SCREEN at the door

PEOPLE INSIDE Kick it open

John Ruth KICKS OPEN THE FRONT DOOR — The WIND from outside WHIPS
INTO THE ROOM - John Ruth and Domergue step quickly inside Ruth
SLAMS the door shut behind him - CUTTING OFF THE WIND - only to
see theres no door lock

The People Inside yell at them

PEOPLE INSIDE (0S)
You have to nail it shut

Both him and her look at them What

PEOPLE INSIDE (0S)
Theres hammer and nails by the door

As they hold the door closed they look down and see a hammer and
a can of nails

So as Domergue holds the wind battered door closed John Ruth
“picks up the hammer grabs some nails and begins pounding them
into a piece of wood on the door
He finishes and starts to put the hammer down when The People
Inside yell at him

PEOPLE INSIDE (0S)
You need to do two pieces of wood

Both John Ruth and Domergue give them a bit of a look but then
turn back to the door He picks off the floor another piece of
wood and hammers it into the door and the wall

When he finishes he lays down the hammer and says

JOHN RUTH
That doors a son of a gun Whos the
idiot who broke that that Mexican fella

He turns from the door to see The People Inside
Its THREE MEN

ONE a BLONDE ENGLISH MAN who wears a grey European cut business
suit who stands up when he sees the man and woman enter the room

Speaking with an English Accent

BLONDE ENGLISH MAN
Good heavens a woman out in this
white hell

(to Domergue)
You must be frozen solid poor thing

The Blonde English Man is a bit of a fop Not a gigantic fop just
a bit of one

TWO an OLD MAN with a white beard in an old Confederate Officer
Uniform

RANK GENERAL

He sits by himself in a cozy chair by the fireplace complete with
ROARING FIRE He doesnt look up when the man and woman enter

and

THREE a lone COWBOY FELLA’ in a cow puncher uniform tan pull
over shirt and pants and chocolate brown leather vest and cool
but worn brown cowboy boots and hat He sits by himself at a table
in the corner

We also take in the inside of Minnies Haberdashery As has been
reported by Bob sadly no Minnie Even without meeting Minnie we
feel her loss to this building With Minnies big presence this
place comes alive and is homey and warm Without her its a cold
shack full of junk
Ye

Theres a kitchen area that includes a pot belly stove

Two comfy chairs sit in front of a fireplace with a big warm
fire crackling in it In one of the cozy chairs sits the Old
General in the other was the English Man before he stood up

Across from the kitchen area on the other side of the room is a
Bar Area A Small Bar with Three Bar Stools And Four Bottles of
Booze Two bottles of Tequila One bottle of Mezcal One bottle of
Brandy

A few scattered small tables for one to four The Cowboy Fella’
sits at one of those

A Picnic Table in the middle of the room for community eating
An Old Piano in the corner

And A Big Iron Double Bed that sits amongst the goods in the
store Its Minnie and Sweet Daves bed

John Ruth answers the English man

JOHN RUTH
Wheres the coffy

The English Man points in the direction of the pot belly stove

Ruth YANKS Domergue in the direction of the pot belly stove and the
coffy

The People Inside see the handcuffs that attach the two

As John Ruth crosses the room heading towards the kitchen area
dragging Domergue along like a rag doll he asks the English Man

JOHN RUTH
Seems like Minnies got er a full house
When did you fellas arrive

ENGLISH MAN
About forty minutes ago

JOHN RUTH

(meaning the

Cowboy Fella)
Is that your driver

John Ruth finds the coffy pot on the stove

ENGLISH MAN
No hes a passenger The driver lit
out He said he was going to spend the

blizzard shacked up with a friend
4S

JOHN RUTH
Lucky devil

John Ruth goes looking for coffy cups He sees a half plucked
chicken makes a face at it He finds a coffy cup and pours
himself a hot cup of Minnies coffy John Ruth takes a DRINK of
coffyThen SPITS IT OUT

JOHN RUTH
Jesus Christ thats awful

The Englishman laughs
As does Domergue

As does John Ruth as he takes the coffy pot and dumps out the
brown junk in it

JOHN RUTH
Christ almighty what that Mexican fella
do soak his ole socks in the pot

ENGLISH MAN
I think we felt the same way but were
a little too polite to say something

DOMERGUE
(referring to Ruth)
He dont have that problem

JOHN RUTH
Wheres the coffy

The English Man points at a bag

ENGLISH MAN
There

John Ruth makes a new pot of coffy dragging Domergue with him
As he prepares the coffy he asks the English Man

JOHN RUTH
So all three of you on the way to Red
Rock when the blizzard stopped ya
huh

ENGLISH MAN
Yes all three of us were on that
stagecoach out there

JOHN RUTH
Wheres the well water

The English Man points at a bucket
4b

ENGLISH MAN
Right there

John Ruth adds water to the coffy pot and puts it on the pot belly
stove to boil

Then suddenly Domergue BLURTS OUT

DOMERGUE
The new sheriff of Red Rock is traveling
with us

JOHN RUTH

Sheriff of Red Rock thatll be the day
If that fellas a sheriff I’m a monkeys
uncle

DOMERGUE
Good then you can share bananas with
your nigger friend in the stable

ENGLISH MAN

(curious)
The new sheriff of Red Rock is traveling
with you

JOHN RUTH
Hes lyin he aint sheriff of nothin
Hes a southern renegade Hes just
talkin his self outta’ freezin to
death is all

(to Domergue)
What the fuck I tell you ‘bout talkin
I will bust you in the mouth right in
front of these people I dont give
a fuck

The English Man watches the terse exchange between the man
and woman with a visible amount of distaste

ENGLISH MAN
You never said your name sir

JOHN RUTH
John Ruth

ENGLISH MAN
Are you a lawman

JOHN RUTH
Im takin her to the law

- ENGLISH MAN
So youre a bounty hunter
JOHN RUTH
Thats right Buster

ENGLISH MAN
Do you have a warrant

John Ruth is surprised by that question

JOHN RUTH
‘Course I do

ENGLISH MAN
May I see it

JOHN RUTH
Why

ENGLISH MAN
Youre suppose to produce it upon request
How am I suppose to know youre not a
villain kidnapping this woman without
a warrant in your possession

JOHN RUTH
(irritated)
Whats your name Buster

ENGLISH MAN
Well it certainly isnt Buster
Its Oswaldo Mobray

JOHN RUTH
Oswaldo

OSWALDO
Yes

JOHN RUTH

Well I got my warrant Oswaldo

John Ruth takes the warrant out of his winter coat and SLAPS it
into Oswaldos hand

Oswaldo removes a glasses case from his suit coat pocket Out of
the case he removes a pair of reading glasses and places them on
his face He examines the document

He looks up from the paper to the face of Daisy Domergue

OSWALDO
I take it you’re Daisy Domergue

Domergue starts to say yes - when John Ruth interrupts her

7
JOHN RUTH
- Its her

Oswaldo goes back to examining the warrant

OSWALDO
(as he reads)
This warrant says Dead or Alive

JOHN RUTH
Yes it does

OSWALDO
Transporting a desperate hostile prisoner
like her sounds like hard work
Wouldnt transporting her be easier if
she were dead

As John Ruth puts the warrant back in the pocket of his winter
coat

JOHN RUTH
No one said the job was suppose to be
easy

OSWALDO
Why is her hanging proper so important
to you

JOHN RUTH
Lets just say I dont like to cheat the
hangman Hes gotta make a living too

Oswaldo Mobray reaches into the pocket of his suit vest and
produces a BUSINESS CARD which he extends to John Ruth

OSWALDO
I appreciate that Allow me to properly
introduce myself Im Oswaldo Mobray
The Hangman in these parts

John Ruth looks at the card

JOHN RUTH
Well la-de-da
(looks at
Oswaldo)
Looks like I brought you a customer

Oswaldo looks at Daisy

OSWALDO
So it would appear
49

DOMERGUE
Have you ever spent two days or more
locked up with one of your customers
beforehand

OSWALDO
No I cant say I have

JOHN RUTH

(to Oswaldo)
Dont talk to my prisoner I talk to my
prisoner thats it You got it

OSWALDO
I got it Jolly good

EXT - MINNIES STABLE - SNOWY DAY

We see the four men left out in the cold 0B MajWarren Bob and
Chris unhitch the six horses one at a time walk them across the
snowy field to the stable and lead them into their stall

Ail four men know how to handie horses

The brutal wind gets more brutal still

INT — MINNIES STABLE —- DAY The stable is a rather large affair It houses eighteen horses
Six from John Ruths coach Six from that other coach out there
that brought Oswaldo and his group As well as six other horses
that would of replaced one of those wagons if there hadnt

been a blizzard

Its quite a full house
The four men get the six horses in to their stalls
As they finish Bob the Mexican says to the other three
BOB
Iil feed and water the horses You go

inside and get some hot coffy Ive got
some stew cooking Should be done soon
SO

OB who as an experienced stagecoach driver has seen his share
of bad weather says to the Mexican put in charge

OB
Look no matter how bad this blizzard
gets we still gotta’ feed these horses
and take a squat from time to time So
me an Chris better lay out a line from
the stable to the front door and from
the front door to the shithouse

BOB
Good idea

OB and Chris grab some rope hammers spikes and get to work on
that

After they leave MajWarren says to Bob

MAJ WARREN
Ill give ya a hand

BOB
No dont worry go inside get warm

MAJ WARREN
Youre doing stable work in a goddamn
blizzard I offer to help and you say
no

BOB
Youre right mi amigo muchas gracias

The two get to the business of feeding and watering the hard
working horses

EXT - MINNIES STABLE - DAY ZL
Chris and 0B stretch out a rope in the harsh snow and wind

One to the front door from the stable The other from the front

door to the outhouse

cuT TO

INT - MINNIES HABERDASHERY - DAY 3)

John Ruth with Domergue in tow has relocated himself to the
makeshift bar drinking tequila out of clay cups with the hangman
Oswaldo Mobray
OSWALDO

(to Domergue)
Now youre wanted for murder For the
sake of my analogy lets assume you
did it

John Ruth SNORTS

Her eyeballs go to John Ruth for a beat then move back to
Oswaldo

DOMERGUE
Soassuming that

OSWALDO
John Ruth wants to take you back to Red Rock
to stand trial for murder AndIF
youre found guilty the people of Red
Rock will hang you in the town square
And as the hangman I will perform the
execution And if all those things end
up taking place thats what civilized
society calls JUSTICE

(beat)
However if the relatives and loved ones
of the person you murdered were outside
that door right now And after busting
down that door they drug you out in the
snow and strung you up by the neck
-that would be FRONTIER JUSTICE
Now the good part about frontier justice
is its very thirst quenching The bad
part is its apt to be Wrong as Right

JOHN RUTH

(to Domergue)
Not in your case In your case youd
have it comin But other people maybe
not so much

OSWALDO
But ultimatelywhats the real
difference between the two The real
difference is METhe Hangman
To me it doesnt matter what you did
When I hang you I will get no
satisfaction from your death Its my
job I hang you in Red Rock I go to
the next town I hang somebody else there
The man who pulls the lever that breaks
your neck will be a dispassionate man
And that dispassion is the very essence
of justice For justice delivered WITHOUT
dispassion is always in danger of not being
justice
As the clay shooter leaves John Ruths lips he looks across the
room suspiciously at The Cowboy Fella’

The Cowboy Fella sits at his table writing in a little book
He BUSTS a peanut shell with his fist then picks up the nut and
pops it in his mouth

John Ruth is just about to turn to Oswaldo and ask about the
Cowboy Fella’

When SUDDENLY we hear a LOUD SNAP SOUND followed by the DEATH CRY
of a surprised rodent Domergue jumps

DOMERGUE
Whats that

OSWALDO
Rat trap

DOMERGUE
What

OSWALDO
Rat trap Minnies basement is apparently
filled with the filthy creatures One less

Then we hear Chris and 0B on the other side of the front door

EXT - MINNIES HABERDASHERY — DAY Chris tries the door it wont open

Then he hears The People Inside YELL from the other side of the
door

PEOPLE INSIDE (0S)

Chris and 0B trade looks

INT - MINNIES HABERDASHERY - DAY s)

Chris Mannix KICKS IN THE FRONT DOOR - The WIND from outside WHIPS
INTO THE ROOM - Chris Mannix and 0B step quickiy inside Mannix
SLAMS the DOOR SHUT behind him - CUTTING OFF THE WIND - Only to
see theres no door lock

PEOPLE INSIDE
You hafta’ nail it shut

So as Chris holds the door closed against the brutal wind OB-
picks up the hammer grabs some nails from the nail can and
begins pounding them into a piece of wood on the door He finishes
and starts to put the hammer down when the people inside yell at
him

PEOPLE INSIDE(OS)
You need to do two pieces of wood

Both OB and Chris give them a bit of a look but then turn
back to the door and pound nails into another piece of wood
sealing the door shut from the elements outside

When OB finishes he lays the hammer down and says

OB
Jesus Christ that doors a whore
5

Chris turns around and takes in the room and the people inside the
roon

CHRIS
Oh I get it haberdashery that was a
joke
He sees John Ruth attached to Domergue at the bar

And on the other side of the room he sees the pot belly stove and
the blue coffy pot on it

The very cold Chris and 0B head for the coffy pot
CHRIS
(to John Ruth)
Hows the coffy

As he reads Oswaldo asks him

Instead of cordially inviting the young respectful man to sit
down the Old Man says curtly

GEN SMITHERS
According to the Yankees its a free
country Do what you want

That wasnt quite a yes but Chris decides to ignore it I mean
his nickname is Dont Give A Damn So Chris sits down anyway
CHRIS

As he sips the other he sits down on the cozy chair covered in

animal skins

GEN SMITHERS

Brandy bottle and snags two empty coffy cups Returning to the
table in front of the 01d General he pours the Brandy into the
two cups And while still standing he picks up one of the cups
and raises it high to toast the sitting General

CHRIS

G1

JOHN RUTH and DOMERGUE
sitting at the bar He hears Chris say that and leans over to
Domergue and says quietly

JOHN RUTH
I dont know about the world But this
goddamn mountain sure seems pretty
fuckin small

BOB KICKS IN THE FRONT DOOR - The WIND from outside WHIPS INTO THE
ROOM - Bob and Maj-Warren step quickly inside Bob SLAMS the DOOR
SHUT behind him - CUTTING OFF THE WIND - Bob says to the Major

BOB
You have to hold it closed while I nail
it shut

MAJ WARREN
Really Whos the idiot who broke the
damn door

BOB
Just hold it closed

MajWarren gives him one of his looks then turns towards the
door holding it as Bob pounds nails into two pieces of wood
holding the door closed

When he finishes Bob puts down the hammer and MajWarren turns
around and gets his first good look at the People Inside

Like 0B and to some degree John Ruth MajWarren has been here
before But hes never been here WITHOUT Minnie and Sweet Dave
And to see the familiar place filled with unfamiliar people makes
the Major uneasy

As MajWarren removes his hat he notices Joe Gage and Oswaldo
still wearing theirs

MajWarren turns to Bob

MAJ WARREN
A lotta hats Senor Bob

BOB
Huh

MAJ WARREN
Considering Minnies no hats indoors
policy If I remember it correctly
that was one of them BAR OF IRON rules
(MORE)
(0

MAJ WARREN
(CONT)
Kinda rule Id think shed want kept
up in her absence But you seem to have
a laissez faire attitude when it comes to the
hats

Bob turns to the sass mouth black Major

BOB
Im guilty I have a laissez faire attitude
about the hats

MAJ WARREN
Fair enough But as a customer of long
standing Id like to lodge a complaint
I think the interior of Minnies is much
friendlier sans hats

BOB
Well mi negro amigo complaint duly noted
How about we forget about the hats today
considering theres a blizzard going on
and all and make tomorrow No Hat
Day

Bob makes his quip and F0Os (fucks off) Major Warren looks at
the People Inside

John Ruth and Domergue sitting at the bar with an official looking
blonde fellow in a grey business suit

Chris sitting in a nice chair by the fireplace with an 01d Man in
a Grey Confederate Officer Uniform

And a lone cow poke sitting by himself at a table

He sees 0B sitting at the picnic table MajWarren goes over to
the pot belly stove picks up the blue coffy pot and pours himself a
cup He then sits down across from 0B at the picnic table

MAJ WARREN
OB 2 I gotta proposition for ya

OB

MAJ WARREN
You asked for two hundred and fifty dollars
the first time right

MAJ WARREN

bitches in Red Rock

MAJ WARREN

They shake hands

As the two men prepare to go outside GenSmithers sits in his
chair looking at MajWarren with bitterness

Chris Mannix notices it

CHRIS
You know that nigger sir

GENSMITHERS
I dont know that nigger I know hes
a nigger Thats all I need to know
Chris laughs to himself
CHRIS
Well that nigger just aint any nigger
That nigger is -

Just as Chris Mannix was going to name Major Marquis Warren to the
Old Man Major Marquis Warren YELLS out across the room

MAJ WARREN
General Sanford Smithers

This gets everybodys attention
MAJ WARREN
(CONT)
Battle of Baton Rouge

Everybody looks from Maj-Warren to the o1d man

The 01d General never looks in the direction of the black Major
But he addresses Chris sitting across from him

GEN SMITHERS
Inform this nigger in the Cavalry uniform
I had a division of Confederates under
my command in Baton Rouge

CHRIS
Major Nigger General Smithers wishes me
to inform you -

MAJ WARREN
- I heard ‘tem hillbilly

MAJ WARREN

(to CHRIS)
Inform this 01d cracker I was in
Baton Rouge as well

(beat)
On the other side

CHRIS

(to Maj-Warren)
Oh thats interesting

(to the Generali)
General Smithers he said -

GENSMITHERS
Capt Mannix inform this nigger I dont
acknowledge the uniforms of Northern niggers

MAJ WARREN
You captured a whole Colored Command that
day But no Colored Troopers ever made it
to a camp did they

The O1d Man finally turns and looks at the black Major

GEN SMITHERS

(to Maj Warren)
We had neither the time the food or
the inclination to care for Northern
horses or Northern niggers

(beat)
So we shot them where they stood

Just as MajWarrens hand moves to his pistol butt Oswaldo Mobray
appears between the two men and says
OSWALDO
Gentlemen I know Americans arent apt
to let a little thing like an unconditional
surrender get in the way of a good war
But I strongly suggest we dont restage
The Battle of Baton Rouge during a blizzard
in Minnies Haberdashery

Oswaldo does have a calming influence on the tension

He continues

OSWALDO

(to Maj-Warren)
Now MajWarren while I realize passions
are high that was a while ago And if
you shoot this un-armed 01d man

placing his hand on

Smithers shoulder)
I guarantee I will hang you by the neck
until you are dead once we arrive in
Red Rock

Chris Mannix looks over at MajWarren and says

CHRIS
I guarantee that too

John Ruth chimes in over by the bar drinking with Domergue

JOHN RUTH
Yeah Warren that the problem with old
men You can kick ‘em down the stairs
and say its a accident but ya cant
shoot ‘em

OSWALDO
Now gentlemen since we may be trapped
here close together like for a few days
may I suggest a possible solution
We divide Minnies in half The Northern
side and The Southern Side With the
dinner table operating as neutral territory
We could say the fireplace side of the room
acts as a symbolic representative of Georgia
While the bar represents

(thinking of a

place)
-Philadelphia
‘12

John Ruth from the bar by Domergue says loudly

JOHN RUTH
As long as the bars Philadelphia
I agree

cuUT TO

EXT - MINNIES HABERDASHERY - DAY

We see MajWarren and OB in this lousy weather remove the three
dead bodies from on top of the stagecoach

It aint easy

The SHOT of MajWarren and 0B starts ZOOMING BACK until we
realize were looking at them through a window We continue to
ZOOM BACK FARTHER till we see Oswaldo at the window watching the
men

CU OSWALDO MOBRAY
The little English man sips his coffy as he watches the two
Americans deal with the dead bodies

JOE GAGE
lies dozing on a cot

CHRIS and GENERAL SMITHERS
sit in the two cozy chairs by the fire

JOHN RUTH (wDomergue)
Pours himself a cup of coffy from a freshly made pot

As he drinks he drifts over to the kitchen area and sees the
aiscarded HALF PLUCKED CHICKEN

BOB

Checks the stew replaces the 1id on the top of the pot and turns
around to face John Ruth (wDomergue) holding the half plucked
chicken in his hand

JOHN RUTH

meaning the

chicken)
What the hell is this

BOB
Its a chicken

JOHN RUTH
No its not Its a half plucked chicken
A half plucked chicken is bad luck We
dont need bad luck in a blizzard
Now whats it doing here

BOB
I was plucking it when your stage
arrived

JOHN RUTH
And you stopped to take care of the
passengers

BOB
Si

JOHN RUTH

Wellyoure not taking care of
the passengers now

BOB
I thought better to deal with the stew

John Ruth roughly shoves the chicken into Bobs hands

JOHN RUTH
Pluck the chicken

Bob takes the chicken and sits down on a stool and finishes the
job of plucking it

At this point in the story almost everybody has been bullied by
John Ruth at some point or another

MAJWARREN KICKS THE FRONT DOOR OPEN - The WIND from outside WHIPS
INTO THE ROOM - MajWarren and 0B hurry inside and SLAM the door
behind them - MajWarren holds the door closed as 0B pounds
nails into two pieces of wood - nailing the door shut

When OB finishes he drops the hammer to the floor

OB
That damn doors a dirty whore

The two freezing men head straight for the pot belly stove and the
coffy pot

Theyre so cold they dont even remove their winter coats

John Ruth picks up the coffy pot and starts pouring the hillbilly
and the black man cups
HH

JOHN RUTH
I just made some more coffy Git some
in ya
They drink the coffy
JOHN RUTH

quietly to

Maj Warren)
We still got that same deal we talked
about in the wagon I help you protect
your eight thousand you help me protect
my ten

MAJ WARREN
Yeah I guess

JOHN RUTH
One of them fellas
(meaning Bob or Joe
or Oswaldo or Chris)
is not what he says he is

OB

JOHN RUTH
Hes in cahoots with this one

(meaning Domergue)
thats what he is One of them maybe
even two of em is here to see Domergue
goes free And to accomplish that goal
theyll kill everybody in here

Maj-Warren looks over to Domergue who hasnt any expression

JOHN RUTH

(CONT)
And they got ‘em a coupla days So all
they gotta’ do is sit tight and wait for
a winda of opportunity And thats when
they strike huh bitch

DOMERGUE
If you say so John

MAJ WARREN
(to John Ruth)
Are you sure youre not just being paranoid

John Ruth doesnt even entertain the question he just continues
JOHN RUTH
Our best bet is this duplicitous fella
aint as cool a customer as Daisy here
He wont have the leather patience it
takes to just sit here and wait

OB
Wait for what

JOHN RUTH
An opportunity to kill us all But waiting
for an oportunity and knowing its the
right one isnt so easy If he cant handle
it hell stop waiting Hell try an
create his opportunity And thats when
MrJumpy reveals himself And I bet he does
it fore mornin I bet he does it way
‘fore mornin’

MajWarren turns his head in the direction of Domergue

MAd WARREN
What do you got to say about all this

DOMERGUE

What do I got to say About John Ruths
ravings Hes absolutely right Me and
one of them fellas is in cahoots And
were just waitin’ for everybody to go
to sleep thats when we gonna kill

Mezcal and eat stew till the sun comes

JOHN RUTH
See what I tell ya She even admits it

MAJ WARREN
I think she was just bein funny

JOHN RUTH
Really Major You show me a fella’ finds
Domergue funny I11 show you a fella’
gonna die laughin’

Maj-Warren and 0B cant quite tell if this old bastard is on to
something or a hopeless loon

JOE GAGE
lying down on the cot with his cowboy hat over his face hears
the bounty hunter John Ruth call out to the room

JOHN RUTH
Okay everybody hear this
Joe takes the hat away from his face and remaining vertical
listens to the bounty hunters speech

JOHN RUTH (wDomergue) stands in the middle of the room talking
to the other people inside of Minnies

JOHN RUTH

(pointing at Domergue)
This here is Daisy Domergue Shes
wanted dead or alive for murder Ten
thousand dollars That moneys mine
boys Dont wanna share it aint
gonna lose it When the sun comes out
Im taking this woman into Red Rock
to hang Now is there anybody here
committed to stopping me from doing that

Nobody says anything

Not Oswaldo Mobray

Not Joe Gage

Not Bob

Not Chris and the 01d General
Not OB

Not The Major

JOHN RUTH
Really Nobody gotta problem with this

Nobody says anything
John Ruth (taking Domergue with him) slowly crosses the room

JOHN RUTH
Well I guess thats very fortunate for
me However I hope you will all understand
I just cant take your word Circumstances
force me to take precautions

When John Ruth stops walking hes standing at the foot of Joe
Gages cot looking down at the reclining cowboy

Looking up at the bounty hunter the cow puncher says
JOE GAGE
When you say precautions why do

I feel you mean me

JOHN RUTH
Because Im gonna take your gun son
TH

JOE GAGE
You are

JOHN RUTH
Yes I am Nothing personal

JOE GAGE
Just mine The Hangman got himself a gun

JOHN RUTH
Ill be dealing with his gun after I deal
with yours

Joe Gage raises from his reclined position to a sitting position
with his hand slowly drifting to the butt of the pistol on his
hip

JOE GAGE
Feel kinda naked without it

John Ruth puts his hand on the butt of his gun and says

JOHN RUTH
I still got mine I11 protect you

Joe Gage almost cant believe the degree of bastard that is John
Ruth Still in his sitting position he places his hand on the
butt of his gun
Domergue standing there next to John Ruth thinks oh shit
Joe Gage looking up at John Ruth says
JOE GAGE

A bastards work is never done

huh John Ruth
John Ruth looking down at Joe Gage says

JOHN RUTH
Thats right Joe Gage Gimmie the gun

Joe Gage laughs a little to himself at John Ruths brazen
masculinity then opens his mouth to say something cool

WHEN

Major Warren SWIFTLY COMES UP BEHIND HIM - THROWING HIS ARM
ACROSS HIS NECK - AND A KNIFE BLADE DUG DEEP (but not too deep)
INTO THE SIDE OF JOE GAGES NECK

Joe Gage starts to struggle

MAJ WARREN
Calm down
Joe Gage freezes
MAJ WARREN

(CONT)
Take your hands away from your pistol

He does
MAJ WARREN
(cONT)
Blink your eyes if youre calm
Joe Gage BLINKS

MajWarren looks up at John Ruth

MAJ WARREN

(CONT)
Did he blink

JOHN RUTH
He blinked

MAJ WARREN

(to Joe Gage)
Blink if your gonna remain calm

Joe Gage BLINKS

JOHN RUTH
He blinked

MAJ WARREN
Take his gun

John Ruth reaches down and removes Joe Gages pistol from the
holster on his hip As he does he tries to soften the blow

JOHN RUTH
Im real sorry about this son Like I
said nothing personal Just a precaution

Maj-Warren takes the knife away lets go of Joe Gages neck and
guickly backs away

Joe doesnt overreact once hes freed

He touches his throat Touches the blood running down the side of
his neck

He removes a BANDANA from his pocket and ties it around his neck
where the knife wound was As he does he glances over his shoulder
at MajWarren
JOE GAGE
(to MajWarren)
Pretty sneaky

MAJWARREN
folds up his knife as he looks back at Joe

John Ruth approaches Oswaldo the hangman
JOHN RUTH
Im afraid the same applies to you too
Mr Mobray

Oswaldo holds open his suit jacket exposing his pistol in its
holster on his belt for John Ruth to extract

OSWALDO
Precautions must be taken because life
is too sweet to lose
John Ruth removes the gun from the holster on Mobrays hip
Then the bounty hunter places both pistols on a table

John Ruth asks Domergue

JOHN RUTH
Hand me that little bucket

She hands him a little bucket

He takes the two mens pistols apart piece by piece and places”
the pieces in the little bucket John crumbles the weapons in his
hands like dirt clods

JOHN RUTH

OB steps up

JOHN RUTH

(CONT)
Go to the outhouse Dump this bucket
down the shit hole

OB
Why do I gotta go outside

JOHN RUTH
Your jackets already on And I sorta
kinda trust you

Ruth looks at Joe Gage and Oswaldo Mobray

JOHN RUTH

(CONT)
When we get to Red Rock Ill replace the
weapons you lost Thats the best I can
do When he leaves you two nail the

John Ruth points at a double barrel shotgun mounted on the wall

BOB
Oh well theres that

Bob takes the shotgun off the wall and hands it to John Ruth

He cracks open the weapon and removes two shotgun shells Placing
them on a nearby table

John holding the shotgun by the barrel walks to the stone
fireplace and SMASHES the wooden stock against the stones

He tosses the useless gun to the floor and looks to his audience

way back to Minnies

INT - MINNIES HABERDASHERY DAY G0)

Everybody eats in silence Silence that is except for all the
GOBBLING SOUNDS as they gobble up the stew

TOHN RUTH and DOMERGUE

up for his female prisoner to see
Q2

JOHN RUTH

He UNLOCKS the handcuffs

For the second time in the movie Domergue’s free from Big Johns
iron

0B KICKS OPEN THE FRONT DOOR then moves quickly inside and
SLAMS IT SHUT

Chris jumps up from the table and helps him hold the door while
0OB pounds the nails that keep it shut

As he pounds in the nails 0B says

oB
Goddamn this fucking fucking whore

The doors done
OB gets some stew

Chris sits back down at the table next to Maj-Warren and across
from John Ruth and Domergue and starts digging into his stew
bowl

CHRIS

(as he eats)
So Domergue I suppose this blizzard
counts as a stroke of luck as far as
youre concerned

DOMERGUE
You dont hear me complaining do ya

CHRIS
No I sure dont

(to Oswaldo)
How bout you Oswaldo

OSWALDO
How about me what
CHRIS
Look considerin all the things I done
for money I aint one to judge But

bout hangin a woman

OSWALDO
Till they invent a TRIGGER that women
cant pull if youre a hang man youre
going to hang women

CHRIS
Well hell Ozzy I quess I aint never
looked at it like that before

JOHN RUTH
When it comes to some of them mean bastards
out there its the only thing does the
job You really only need to hang mean
bastards But mean bastards you need to
hang

OSWALDO
But as I was telling MrRuth and
MissDomergue earlier I dont like the
term HANG-MAN Im a Executioner
Assuming MissDomergue has a pain in the
neck in her future it wont be me that
hangs her It will be the judge the jury
and by extension the entire town of
Red Rock that sentences her to hang-
(beat)
I just execute the sentence

CHRIS
Well I know how ya feel Ozzy I dont
like a lot of the terms John Ruth throws
at me But short of shootin ‘em I
dont know a hellva lot I can do about it

JOHN RUTH

INSERT PAGE

Major Warren moves his eyes in Chris Mannixs direction then
moves them back down to his stew bowl

MAJ WARREN
I aint in the mood Mannix Leave me be
from your horseshit

CHRIS
Well oddly enough its horseshit I wanted

to speak with you about
MajWarren puts down his spoon and turns in his seat to face
Chris

MAJ WARREN
I tole you jackass to Hee-Haw somewhere
else and I meant it

Chris turns in his seat so hes facing MajWarren

CHRIS

John Ruth says you gotta a Lincoln Letter
(to John Ruth)

Thats right John you said that didnt ya

JOHN RUTH
Yes I did

CHRIS
(to MajWarren)
Soyou gotta letter from Abraham

Lincoln
MAJ -WARREN

CHRIS

MAJ WARREN

CHRIS

United States

MAJ WARREN

CHRIS

CHRIS

CHRIS
Personally As in Dear MajWarren

MAJWARREN
No Personally as in Dear Marquis

CHRIS
Dear Marquis
Abraham Lincoln-the-President-of-the-
United-States-ofAmerica

(said as one

word)

MAJ WARREN
Yes

CHRIS
May I see it

MAJ WARREN
No you may not

CHRIS
But the way John tells it you werent
just some random nigger soldier picked
from a pile of letters

(beat)
Way John telis it yall hada
correspondence

MAJ WARREN
Yes

CHRIS

Way John tells it yalls practically
pen pais

MAJ WARREN
Yes

CHRIS
And a pen pals practically a
friend

MajWarren doesnt say anything He just turns away from Chris and
eats his stew

Chris turns around to face John Ruth sitting across from him

CHRIS

(to John Ruth)
So you think a nigger drummed outta’
the Calvary with a yellow stripe down

his backwas practically friends with
The President of The United States of
America

Now that John Ruth has watched that episode played out in front of
him And frankly now that he thinks about it the letters
authenticity does seem unlikely -
O)

CHRIS
John Ruth I hate to be the one to break
it to ya’ but nobody in Minnies Haberdashery
has ever corresponded with Abraham Lincoln
Least of all THIS NIGGER HERE

John Ruth looks across at MajWarren

MajWarren looks back at him

JOHN RUTH
Was that all horseshit
MAJ WARREN
Course it was
BEAT
THEN

DOMERGUE BURSTS OUT LAUGHING

John Ruth looks over at her picks up his stew bowl and THROWS THE
STEW IN HER FACE

Then holding out the empty wooden bowl in front of her face he
says

JOHN RUTH
Unless you want to eat this bowl that
better be the last time you laugh at me
He BACKHANDS HER with the bowl KNOCKING HER TO THE FLOOR

Looking down at her from the bench he says

JOHN RUTH
You got it

Domergue on the floor holding her face nods her head yes

JOHN RUTH
Let me hear you say I got it

EYES OF HATE
Look up from the floor and say

DOMERGUE
T got it

John Ruth points down at her with his big finger

“JOHN RUTH
You damn well better
Then he turns and faces Maj-Warren sitting across from him

JOHN RUTH
So I guess its true what they say about
you people You cant believe a fuckin’ word
that comes outta’ your mouths

MAJ WARREN
Whats wrong I hurt your feelings

JOHN RUTH
As-a-matter-of-fact you did

MAJ WARREN
Now I know Im the only black son-of-a-bitch
you ever met so Im gonna cut your ass
some Slack But you aint got no idea what
a black man starin’ down America looks like
(small beat)
The only time black folks are safe is when
white folks are disarmed

Pulling the phony letter out of his inside jacket pocket

MAJ WARREN

(CONT)
This letter had the desired effect of
disarming white folks They believed the
Lincoln Letter because they wanted to
believe the Lincoln Letter and White
folks will believe anything they WANNA
believe

JOHN RUTH
Call it what you want I call it a
dirty trick

He puts the letter back inside his coat

MAJ WARREN
Wanna know why Id lie about something
that white man

(beat)
Got me on that stagecoach didnt it

Yes it did thinks John Ruth and the thought makes him blink

MajWarren suddenly stands up from the table taking his stew bowl
and spoon with him As Warren walks away Chris says to the table

CHRIS
Well Ill tell you like the lord tole
John a letter from Abraham Lincoln
wouldnt Kidave that kinda effect on me
I might let a whore piss on it
Oo

General Sanford Smithers sits alone in his grey uniform bathed
in crackling and cackling FIRE LIGHT

MajWarren walks over to the stew pot pours some food into an
empty bowl Picks up a big wooden spoon Walks over to where
GenSmithers sits And places the stew bowl and spoon next to him
on a little table GenSmithers looks to the stew bowl

then up at the black fella in Cavalry pants that stands over him

Across the room Chris Mannix yells at MajWarren
CHRIS
Warren goddamit you leave that old man
alone
MajWarren yells across the room right back
MAJ WARREN
Stand down you son-of-a-bitch I shared
a battle field with this man
That makes Chris stand down

MajWarren looks down at the o1d man in the cozy chair

MAJ WARREN
Or would you deny me that too

GENSMITHERS
I suppose you were there

Maj-Warren points at the empty cozy chair across from The 01d General

MAJ WARREN
May I join you

After a clock tick or two without looking up at him the old man
says

GEN SMITHERS
Yes you may

Holding his stew bowl and big wooden spoon Maj-Warren sits in the
chair opposite GenSmithers MajWarren is coming correct to the
old Southern General at least as far as the old Southern General
is concerned Correct due to age due to rank and due to race

The two men sit in silence as MajWarren eats a spoonful of stew
Bob answers

The Old Man

The Old Man
shoves some
grey beard

The two men
bowls

GENSMITHERS
Whats in the stew

MAJ WARREN
I dont know
(yelling to
Bob)
Hey Bob Whats in the stew

BOB

snorts

GENSMITHERS
There ain’t no buck in that bowl

picks up the spoon and the bowl next to him and
in his mouth Then with some brown stew staining his
Smithers says

GENSMITHERS
A lotta horse Lotta’ possum be my
guess

sit in their chairs by the fire eating out of their

Bob finishes at the picnic table and moseys over to the piano
and starts to hesitantly play the Christmas tune Silent Night

SUDDENLY

Below their
BETWEEN TWO

feet in the basement the SOUNDS of a VICIOUS FIGHT
RATS breaks out

DOMERGUE
What the fuck is that

GENSMITHERS
Rat fight

DOMERGUE
What

MAJ WARREN
Its two rats in the basement fightin

GEN SMITHERS
I wouldnt be surprised when it comes to
the stew if the basement wasnt a
constant supply of meat
The RAT FIGHT CONTINUES unseen
Bob fucks up Silent Night and starts again

CHRIS
How long these mice gonna fight

GEN SMITHERS
As with all living things depends on
the rats Usually till one kills the
other or one realizes its beaten

Suddenly the rat fight is over

GENSMITHERS
(CONT)
Wonder which it was

The two former Civil War officers continue to eat stew with big
wooden spoons

MAJ WARREN
Hows life been since the war

GENSMITHERS
Got both of my legs Got both of my arms
Cant complain

MAJ WARREN
Got a woman

GENSMITHERS
Fever took her beginning this winter

MAJ WARREN
Me I never went in for a woman regular

GEN SMITHERS
In my day no one asked you if you went
in for it You just did it

MAJ WARREN
What was her name

GEN SMITHERS
Betsy

MAJ WARREN
Georgia girl

AT
GEN SMITHERS

of my ponies from I made a good deal

up pretty good Did a hellva lot better
than my no good brothers thats for damn
sure All in allcant complain Betsy
took fat after our boy But I never minded
that She was a nice woman I never minded
anything she did

MAJ WARREN
Yeah your son came up here a coupila
years ago He spoke highly of his mama
too

A SHARP STING goes through Sandy Smithers body as he shifts his
focus on the black man

Just as Bob fucks up Silent Night and starts again

GEN SMITHERS
You knew my boy

MAJ WARREN
Did I know em
(small chuckle)
YeahI knew em
The old man snorts

GEN SMITHERS
You didnt know ‘em

MajWarren places his stew bowl aside and says

MAJ WARREN
Fine suit yourself

MaWarren stands and the old man grabs his wrist

GEN SMITHERS
Didja know my boy

Maj-Warren looks down at the frantic 01d man and says calmly

MAJ WARREN
I know the day he died do you

The old man is hit in the heart He croaks out a

GEN SMITHERS
No

Looking down at the feeble old man in the chair

MAJ WARREN
Wanna know what day that was

The old man clutches the black mans sleeve tighter

GEN SMITHERS
Yes

The black man leans down slightly closer to the old man and says

MAJ WARREN
The day he met me

The white old man falls back in his chair

As Bob continues to play Silent Night more confidently the black
bounty hunter removes one of his pistols from his gun belt and
places it on the little table next to Sandy Smithers chair

The old man looks down at it

Then with one pistol left in his gun belt MajWarren walks over
to the bar in Philadelphia leans against it sideways and
continues talking to the old man in Georgia

MAJ WARREN
He came up here to do a little nigger
head huntin By then the reward was
five thousand and bragging rights
But back then to battle hard rebs five
thousand just to cut off a niggers head
that was good money So the Johnnys
climbed this mountain lookin for fortune
But there was no fortune to be found
All they found was me All them fellas
came up here when they found themselves
at the mercy of a niggers gun sang a
different tune Lets just forget it
I go my way you go yours” thats your
boy Chester talkin

The old man by the fire SCREAMS AT HIM from across the room

GEN SMITHERS
You a damn lie

MAJ WARREN
If you just let me go home to my family
Ill never set foot in Wyoming again
thats what they all said Some of them
ole’ boys had some real sad stories to
tell too

(beat )
Beggin for his life your boy told me
his WHOLE LIFE STORY And you was in that
story General And when I knew me I had
the boy of The Bloody Nigger Killer of Baton Rouge
I knew me I was gonna have some fun

The other people most of which are still around the picnic table
know exactly what MajWarren is doing Hes placed a loaded pistol
by the old man and now is trying to provoke GenSmithers to pick

it up and point it at the black man At which point the black man
can legally shoot him dead in self defense

Chris Mannix is on his feet YELLING at the black man and the old
white man

CHRIS

(to Maj Warren)

You shut your lyin nigger lips up

(to GenSmithers)
GenSmithers dont listen to em he
dont know your boy He just heard tell
why you here is all Hes just peckin
at ya for a fight

MAJ WARREN
(to Gen Smithers)
It was cold the day I killed your boy
And I dont mean snowy mountain
in Wyoming coldColder than that
And on that cold day with your boy at
the business end of my gun barrel
-I made him STRIP Right down to his
bare ass Then I told him to start walkin

FLASH TO

EXT - SNOWY VISTA IN THE MOUNTAINS - DAY

We see what MajWarren describes But we see the BIG WIDE
70MM SUPER CINEMASCOPE VERSION
9S

A magnificent white Wyoming winter vista and inside of it
Maj-Warren on his horse Lash pointing a rifle at A NAKED WHITE
MAN walking ahead of him in the snow

MAJWARREN VOICE (0S)
I walked his naked ass for two hours-

Then we see the naked White Man collapse in the snow
MajWarren holds up his horse and watches the cold man

MAJWARREN VOICE (0S)

BACK TO MINNIES G2)

CU GENSMITHERS
GENSMITHERS
You never knew my boy

Chris joins in

CHRIS
No he didnt Hes just a sneaky nigger
tryin to getcha to go for that gun
This black devils a bounty hunter
thats how bounty hunters do

MajWarren just continues with his story His concentration
unaffected by the other voices in the room

MAJ WARREN
Then he started in begging again But
this time he wasnt begging to go home
He knew hed never see his home again
And he wasnt beggin for his life no
more That was long gone and he knew it
He was just beggin’ for a BLANKET
Now dont judge your son too harshly
You aint never been as cold as your boy
was that day Youd be surprised what a
man that cold would-do-for-a-blanket
Wanna know what your boy did

The old man watches the storyteller eyes bulging out of his head

MAJ WARREN

(pause)
I took my big black pecker outta my pants
And I made him crawl in the snow on all
fours over to it Then I grabbed a hand
full of that black hair on the back of
his head
Go

The old man leans forward in his chair

MAJ WARREN
Then I stuck that big black johnson
right down his goddamn throat And that
johnson was fulla’ blood So it was warm
You bet your sweet ass it was warm And
Chester Charles Smithers sucked on that
warm black dingus as long as he could

FLASH ON
EXT - SNOWY VISTA - DAY We see what MajWarren describes in BIG WIDE 70MM SUPER
CINEMASCOPE

A WHITE WINTER WYOMING VISTA and inside of that vista is a Naked
White Man on his knees sucking the dick of a Heavily Clothed Black
Man in the snow

BACK TO MINNIES CU GENSMITHERS
the old man is in knots It was worse than his imagination ever
dared

He knows the truth when he hears it This is how Chester ended his
life

CU MAJ WARREN
the black Major has the white General right where he wants him He
flashes an alligator grin and says

MAJ WARREN
Starting to see pictures aint ya
Your son Black dudes dingus in his
mouth Him shiverin - him cryin -
me laughin - him not understandin
But you understand doncha Sandy
(beat)
I never did give your boy that blanket
Even after all he did and he did
everything I asked No blianket
That blanket was just a heart breakin
liars promise Sorta like when the
union issued those colored troopers
uniformsthat you chose not to
acknowledge

MajWarren makes his point

Its a pretty good one
MAJ WARREN
So what are you gonna do old man
You gonna spend the next two or three
days ignoring the nigger who killed
your boy Ignoring how I made him suffer
Ignoring the agony I inflicted Ignoring
how I made him lick all over my Johnson
Yep the dumbest thing your boy ever did
was let me know he was your boy

The Old Man LEAPS TO HIS FEET GRABBING THE GUN bringing the
pistols barrel up towards MajWarren at the bar

Barely even turning towards him MajWarren calmly and smoothly
pulls his pistol from his holster and puts a bullet square in the
Old Mans chest

MajWarrens pistol BLOWS GENSMITHERS OFF HIS FEET and INTO THE
ROARING FIREPLACE

His old uniform CATCHES FIRE and he FLIP FLOPS on the floor
letting out a HIGH PITCHED SCREAM as The O1d Man burns

Some of the people at Minnie’s run to put out the fire
MajWarren DRAWS HIS GUN stopping them

MAJ WARREN
Let ‘em burn

And burn he does
Till hes dead
CHRIS
We gotta’ put it out ‘fore it burns
this whole place down

Major Marquis replaces his pistol back in its holster

MAJ WARREN

An unseen LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack clueing the
audience into whats happening

NARRATOR (VO)
About fifteen minutes has passed since
we last left our characters During that
time Chris John Ruth and Oswaldo got
into a vigorous debate about the legality
of what just transpired Marquis Warren
who is supremely confident about the
legality of what just transpired ignored
them sat at a table by himself and
finished the brandy bottle Then as the
legality discussion started to wind down
due to lack of oxygen Joe Gage and OB
carried the dead charred body of GenSmithers
out of the haberdashery to stash out in
the snow Bob held the door for them
Domergue however hasnt moved from her
spot at the community dinner table since
John Ruth uncuffed her

The CAMERA begins to CRANE DOWN towards Domergue till it LANDS on
a TIGHT MEDIUM of her

NIRRATOR (VO)

The front door opens and Joe Gage and 0OB walk through it

Bob slams the door and goes about nailing it shut

The very cold 0B makes a bee-line towards the blue coffy pot

Joe Gage heads for the fireplace to warm up instead

John Ruth by the pot belly stove lifts the blue coffy pot off of
the stove and pours the stagecoach driver a cup

Right after it gets poured 0B brings it up to his lips and
DRINKS IT

John Ruth pours himself a cup then replaces the blue coffy pot
back on the hot stove

OB heads over to the bar to light candles and lanterns now its
getting darker

John Ruth takes the untouched coffy cup and crosses the room back
over to the picnic dinner table that Domergue is sitting at

He takes a DRINK OF POISON COFFY as he sits down next to Domergue
Domergue watches him do it and cant help but smile

John Ruth sees her smile at him

He holds out the coffy cup offering her some

JOHN RUTH

DOMERGUE
No thanks Its getting late
Coffy makes me jumpy

JOHN RUTH

John Ruth quickly turns to Chris Mannix with the cup of coffy in his
hand

JOHN RUTH

Everybody in the room hears this
Mannix throws his coffy cup to the floor undrunk

Ruth turns back to Domergues laughing bloody face and PUNCHES
it again knocking her to the floor

Daisy continues to laugh as he climbs on top of her grabbing a
handful of her hair with one hand and bringing his other fist
SMASHING IN HER FACE

THEN

The poison hits John Ruths guts again he WRETCHESand PUKES

of the dead bad ass John Ruth

MAJ WARREN
two guns in hand one of his own the other John Ruths a third
in the holster on his hip keeps them pointed at the four men

MajWarren looks down at OB
Dead
He looks to John Ruth and Domergue on the floor
One dead one stares back with hate
Then he looks to the four men he has lined up against the wall
MAJ WARREN
(to the room)
Yall keep your mouth shut and do what
I tell ya Anybody opens their mouth

little weirdlittle sudden - gonna
get a bullet Not a warning Not a question

Using John Ruths line the Major says

MAJ WARREN
Let me hear you say I got it

He makes them say it

MAJ WARREN
Mannix

Chris Mannixs eyes go to him

MAJ WARREN
Get over on this side

Chris moves cautiously away from the wall to the Majors side of
the room

MAJ WARREN
Take that pistol out of this holster

Indicating the pistol still in the left side holster hanging from
the Majors hip

Chris looks at him with an expression that says Really
The Major nods affirmative
Chris cautiously removes the pistol from the black mans belt

Now Chris has a gun He looks to the Major who still has two guns
pointed at the other three men against the wall

MAJ WARREN
Okay point it at them Like I said
they do anything - and I mean anything
- kill em

Chris Mannix does that

CHRIS

(to MajWarren)
So you finally decided Im tellin the
truth ‘bout bein the sheriff of Red
Rock huh

MAJ WARREN
(to Chris)
I dont know bout all that But you
aint the killer who poisoned that
coffy You almost drunk it your own
damn self -
The Majors eyes go back to the three men against the wall

MAJ WARREN
(to them)
But one of yall is

The Major hears something and he turns towards Domergue on the
floor

She has dug the TINY HANDCUFF KEY out of John Ruths pocket and
is just about to stick it in the lock and free herself from the
corpseWHEN

MajWarren points one of his pistols at her and FIRES into the
FLOOR next to her The SOUND in the enclosed log cabin is eardrum
exploding LOUD She freezes

MajWarren his one arm outstretched holding a gun pointed at the
three men against the wall The other arm is holding a gun pointed
at Domergue on the floor He takes the gun pointed at Domergue
and places it back in its holster Then he holds his hand out
palm up to Domergue

MAJ WARREN
Gimmie the key

It breaks her heart but she places the tiny handcuff key in the
palm of his hand his fingers close around it

Maj-Warren walks across the room to the pot belly stove He opens
the door of the stove above the fire and TOSSES THE TINY KEY
INSIDE

Domergue whose modus operandi is outrageous behavior and the
disarming affect it has on opponents cant believe Marquis just
did what he did She SCREAMS AT HIM

DOMERGUE
YOU MOTHERFUCKING BLACK BASTARD Youre
gonna die on this mountain and Im
gonna’ fucking laugh when you do

MajWarren turns from the stove and FIRES his pistol at Domergue

The BULLET EXPLODES in the dead body of John Ruth next to her
SHOWERING HER WITH RUTHS BLOOD It shocks her enough to shut her

up

Chris chimes in

Bob pointing at

MAJ WARREN

(CONT)
You need to understand You just shot
the only man committed to getting you
to Red Rock alive Raise your voice
again and the next bullet goes in your
lung

all the attention in the room He turns from her
them against the wall

MAJ WARREN
Nowone of youis workin with her
Ortwo of you are workin with her
Or-all yall is workin with her
But only one of you poisoned the coffy

(gesturing towards

Domergue)
Now whatever charms this bitch got make
you brave a blizzard and kill in cold blood
Tm sure I dont know ButJohn Ruths
trying to hang your woman so you kill
himokay - maybe But OB wasnt
hangin nobody Hes sure enough dead now
though aint he Just like any one of
us whod drank that coffy

(to the three)
Those of you against the wail dont
practice in poison should think about
that Think about how that coulda been
you rollin around on the floor
And about how one of the men next ta’ ya
is responsible

CHRIS
And I know who I got my money on
(to Joe Gage)
Yeah thats right cow puncher
I’m lookin’ at you

MAJ WARREN

(to Chris)
Not so fast Chris Well get there
Lets slow it down Lets slow it
way down

(to the three)
Who made the coffy

the dead bounty hunter on the floor says

BOB
He did -

08
CHRIS
Yeah he did didnt he
MAJ WARREN
Yes he did

The Major thinks silently for a moment
They watch him think
Then he says

MAJ WARREN

(CONT)
Why is The Hangman whos got nothing
on his mind except gettin this girl
to the gallows brewin the coffy at
Minnies Haberdashery

The Little English Man points at The Mexican Man

OSWALDO
Because his coffy was dreadful

MAJ WARREN
(to Bob)
Really Well aint that interesting

BOB

(to Maj Warren)
You didnt have any of my coffy
bounty hunter So dont be so sure about
what this little man says

JOE GAGE
I had his coffy Wasnt the best coffy
I ever drank but wasnt nothin’ wrong
with it

BOB
If you want me to make a pot of coffy
all you have to do is ask

MAJ WARREN
Maybemaybebut its the stew got me
thinking When did you say Minnie left
A week ago

BOB
Si
MAJ WARREN
See when my mama made stew it always
tasted the same no matter the meat
And there was another fellow on the
plantation Uncle Charly and he made
stew too And just like my mamas I ate
his stew from the time I was a whipper
to a full grown man And no matter the
meat it always tasted like Uncle Charlys
stew Now I aint had Minnies stew in
bout six months or so so I aint no expert
But that damn sure was Minnies stew So
if Minnies on the north side visiting her mama
howd she make the stew this morning

MajWarren moves over to the cozy chair he sat in opposite General
Smithers earlier Its covered in a blanket and a few animal
skins

MAJ WARREN
This is Sweet Daves chair When I sat
in it earlier I couldnt believe it
Nobody sits in Sweet Daves chair
I mean this may be Minnies place but
this damn sure is Sweet Daves chair
If Sweet Dave did go to the north side
Im pretty goddamn sure that chairs
going with him

He removes the skins and blanket that cover the chair The cloth
patterned chair has a BIG BLOOD STAIN on it

MajWarren looks to the room for a reaction

BOB
So are you actually accusing me of murder

MAJ WARREN
Well Bob it’s like this Whoevers
workin with her

(meaning Domergue)
aint who they say they are If its you
that means Minnie and her man aint at
her mamas Theyre lyin out back there
dead somewhere

(to Oswaldo)
Or if its you British Man the real
Oswaldo Mobray is lyin in a ditch somewhere
And youre just an English fella’ passin
off his papers

CHRIS

(to Joe Gage)
Or we go by my theory which is the ugliest
guy did it Which makes it you Joe Gage
BOB

(to MajWarren)
So I take it youve deduced the coffy
was poisoned while you were murdering
the old man

MAJ WARREN
Yes

BOB
Well during that whole incident I was
sitting on that side of the room
playing Silent Night on the piano

The piano couldnt be further from the pot belly stove

MAJ WARREN

(to Bob)
I didn’t say you poisoned the coffy
I said you didnt make the stew

(to all)

My THEORY is Youre working with the
man who poisoned the coffy And both of
you murdered Minnie and Sweet Dave
and anybody else might a picked the wrong

day to visit the Haberdashery this morning

And your intention was at some point
ambush John Ruth and free Daisy But you
didnt expect the blizzard and you
didnt expect the two of us

(using the barrel

of his pistol to

indicate both him

and Chris)
Thats as far as I got How am I doin

BOB
Your a real imaginative nigger aint
you So do you intend to murder me based
on a far fetched nigger theory
Or can you prove it cabrone

MAJ WARREN

It ain’t so far fetched Bob

And its a bit more than theory
(beat)

When did you start workin for Minnie

BOB
Four months ago
12

MAJ WARREN
Well if you worked here two and a half
years ago youda known all about the
sign usta hang above the bar

Bob doesnt know what hes talking about

MAJ WARREN
Minnie never mentioned it
BOB
No
MAJ WARREN

You know what that sign said Bob
Bob doesnt say anything

MAJ WARREN
It said NO DOGS OR MEXICANS ALLOWED
Minnie hung up that sign the day she
opened The Habadashery And it hung up
there every day till they took it down
a little more then two years ago
You know why they took it down

(beat) ©
They started lettin in dogs

Bob doesnt say anything

MAJ WARREN

(CONT)
Minnie likes everybody But she sure
dont like Mexicans So you tell me
Minnie went to the North side to visit
her mama Well I find that highly
unlikelybut okay - maybe
But you tell me Minnie Mink took The
Habadashery the most precious thing
to her in the world and put it in the
hands of a Goddamn Mexican
Well thats what I meant when I said
That sure dont sound like Minnie

The TRAP DOOR IN THE FLOOR

that leads to the basement begins to SLOWLY LIFT OPEN We cant

see whos opening the trap door but neither can MajWarren because
the door is behind both him and Chris

The THREE MEN AGAINST THE WALL (BOB OSWALDO AND JOE GAGE)
see the basement door open up behind MajWarren and Chris and a
PISTOL PEEK OUT POINTING AT MAJWARRENS BACK
MAJ WARREN
Youre a liar Bob And if youre lying
which you are that means you killed
Minnie

MajWarren SHOOTS BOB in the chest the bullet goes through him
EXPLODING BLOOD and GUNK AGAINST THE BACK WALL

MAJ WARREN
and you killed Sweet Dave

MajWarren SHOOTS BOB AGAIN BLOWING HIM BACK AGAINST THE WALL
Bobs body does a bloody slide to the floor

MajWarren points his pistol at the face of the corpse on the
floor that was once Bob

MAJ WARREN
And more than likely the driver of
that stagecoach out there

MajWarren SHOOTS his pistol destroying the face of Bob

Then the Black Major brings up his smoking pistol barrel and
points it in the direction of the two men left

MAJ WARREN
Three measly bulletsand there goes Bob
But that still dont get us any closer to
which of you two poisoned the coffy does
it Chris

CHRIS

Jody answers by taking out his pistol and SHOOTING the surprised
Minnie and Ed point blank

Joe Gage raises his gun and FIRES into Judys shoulder blowing
her across the room and slamming her into a wood post

Oswaldo removes his pistol from its holster and FIRES

Shooting Gemma through the glass jar of jelly beans She tumbles
from the ladder to the floor

Bob brings up his pistol and fanning the hammer SHOOTS Sweet Dave

Judy shot in the shoulder against the wood post She looks across
to Joe Gage with a complete lack of understanding but a big
question on her face

He doesn’t answer her questioning look he just SHOOTS her a
second time this time more effectively The bullet hits her
square in the chest wiping away her questioning expression and
spinning her hard to the floor
Charly runs for the door
Bob takes three WILD POT SHOTS at him missing the boy but

Jody climbs up top through the door in the floor and joins Bob in

the kitchen area

Jody rips pieces
ears

JODY

(to Bob)
Other then those dam blasted rats down
there that basements perfect I can
sit right underneath that dirty so an sos
nose the entire time and Ruth wont be
the wiser

BOB
Unless he checks the basement

JODY
Shitfire I hope he does I11 shoot
‘em dead climbin down that ladder
End of story end of problem

of cloth off of an old rag and sticks it in both

BOB
How many rats down there
JODY
I dunnothree hundred
BOB
You gonna be down there all night with
300 rats
JODY

A room fulla’ rabbits aint gonna
stop me from savin my sister
Specially after I go down there and
show them bunnys whos boss

He picks up the lantern opens the trap door in the floor and
descends into the basement

WE HEAR UP TOP Jody go down there and start both YELLING and
SHOOTING at the rats He empties both pistols at the scurrying

rodents

Oswaldo and Joe Gage come back inside hearing all the shooting
going on underneath the floor

OSWALDO
Whats with all the shooting
Jody walks to the trap door and says up to them

JODY
Just demonstrating the new basement
rules to these rats

JOE

Hows that goin’
JODY

They get the general idea
(beat )

Can you believe this room its perfect
He sees the worried looks on both of their faces

JODY
(CONT)
Whats wrong

OSWALDO
Bad news

EXT - SNOWY MOUNTAIN TOP - MORNING Oswaldo Joe Gage Bob and Jody take a hike to a mountain top
clearing and look down off the cliff to see whats coming at
them

What they see is bad weather

JODY
Whats that

OSWALDO
Having lived in Switzerland I can tell
you exactly what that is Its a blizzard

JODY
A blizzard Is it gonna hit us for sure

OSWALDO
Oh yes

JODY
When

OSWALDO

Sometime tonight
3G

BOB
If theres a blizzard coming we cant
stay in that shack

JODY
Get some gumption Marco That shack
probably sees about twelve blizzards
a year If we hadnt killed Minnie and
her nigger menagerie what would they do
Theyd hole up thats what theyd do

OSWALDO
Im afraid I have to agree with mi amigo
here We should move on to Red Rock while
we have the chance

JODY
If them niggers can ride it out at
Minnies so can we We aint movin
no damn where were holein up
Bob makes an exasperated noise

Jody turns to him

JODY

You got something you wanna say
BOB

Have you ever been in a blizzard
JODY

No
BOB

I didnt think so Funny how the people
who have been in a blizzard are the ones
who want to go And the people who dont
know what the hell theyre talking about
are the ones who want to stay

JODY
Look John Ruth is a rattlesnake And the
only way were gonna separate him from
my sister is catch him off guard or at
least on awkward footing Now before they
get to Red Rock him here with a spoon
in his mouth seemed the best bet
But if he has to sit here on his ass for
three days chained to Daisy waiting for
the sun to come outat some point
hes gotta close his eyes
And thats when you blow the top of his
head off
JOE GAGE
Look ambushing John Ruth while he ate
was always risky for Daisy But it was
the best chance we had so we were gonna’
chance it
This blizzard changes everything
And if the idea is to safely separate
Daisy from this joker this sit-tight
-during-the-blizzard idea is obviously
the safest way for Daisy

JODY
Well if thats obviously the safest way
to free Daisy thats obviously the way
were gonna do it Daisy aint just my
sister Shes a goddamn dependable member
of this gang And if any one of you aint
willin to brave a blizzard to save a member
of your own gang from a rope you ought’ not
be ridin with em

I guess they heard that

or three days at some point he will

GROUCH
I think the first forty-five seconds hes

JODY
If you gotta shot Grouch you take it
But be right

Jody disappears in the cellar closing the door in the floor
pehind him but before he does he yells to the seated General
Smithers

JODY

We now show the audience this scene again except this time from the
perspective of The Domergue Gang Grouch Douglass (Joe Gage)
English Pete Hicox (Oswaldo Mobray) and Daisy Domergue

After seeing MARCO THE MEXICAN (BOB) outside Domergue sees her
two favorite gang members inside GROUCH DOUGLASS (JOE GAGE) and
ENGLISH PETE HICOX (OSWALDO MOBRAY) -

GROUCH DOUGLASS and ENGLISH PETE HICOX
(JOE GAGE) (OSWALDO MOBRAY)
Sitting at his table Sitting in Sweet Daves chair

GROUCH(JOE) and ENGLISH PETE(OSWALDO)
You have to nail it shut

DOMERGUE and JOHN RUTH

GROUCH(JOE) and ENGLISH PETE(OSWALDO)
Theres a hammer and nails by the door

John Ruth turns to hold the door closed sees the can of nails by his
feet and the hammer lying beside it

He indicates for Domergue to hold the door closed She does
John Ruth BANGS the nail with the hammer

ENGLISH PETE sitting in Sweet Daves chair watches the bounty
hunter pound the nail Then shifts his eyes over to GenSmithers
who looks down at his lap

ENGLISH PETE(OSWALDO)
(whispering)
Look at me old man

The Old Man brings his eyes up to the Englishman across from him

ENGLISH PETE(OSWALDO)
Easy 01d boy One wrong gestureone
“awkwardly worded sentenceI put a
bullet in your gizzard

The BANGING stops
Grouch (Joe) yells

GROUCH ( JOE)
You need to do

English Pete joins in

GROUCH and ENGLISH PETE
two pieces of wood

Both Domergue and John Ruth give them a bit of a look then turn
back to the door and get to work

BANG BANG BANG goes the hammer

GROUCH DOUGLASS (JOE GAGE)
sits at his table with his diary and writing utensils in front of
him

The CAMERA PANS DOWN BELOW THE TABLE We see Grouch fingering the
pistol in his holster with his gun hand

John Ruth finishes hammering in the second piece of wood

JOHN RUTH
That door’s a son of a gun Whos the
idiot that broke that that Mexican
fella

Him and Domergue turn to face the room

DOMERGUE
sees ENGLISH PETE who hops to his feet

ENGLISH PETE(OSWALDO)
Good heavens a woman out in this
white hell

Domergue smiles at Petes foppish accent

ENGLISH PETE(OSWALDO)
(to Domergue)
You must be frozen solid poor thing

JOHN RUTH
(to Oswaldo)
Wheres the coffy

English Pete points to the pot belly stove and the non deadly BLUE
COFFY POT John Ruth YANKS Domergue over to it
ie

ENGLISH PETE

as OSWALDO MOBRAY hurries over to where John Ruth is making coffy
and makes conversation But his real purpose is to cut off John
Ruth and make the bounty hunter STOP and pay attention to the
little English man Which is another way of saying not paying
attention to Grouch Douglass whose plan is to shoot John Ruth
from his chair if he can get a good shot during the bounty
hunters first disorienting sixty seconds in the room

JOHN RUTH
Looks like Minnies got ‘er a full
house When did you fellas arrive

ENGLISH PETE(OSWALDO)
About forty minutes ago

UNDERNEATH GROUCHS TABLE
His gun hand removes his pistol from its holster The end of the

barrel finds John Ruth
English

John Ruth turns and gestures towards Grouch at the table
cking

Pete steps into Ruths line of vision ever so slightly blo
his view

JOHN RUTH
Is that your driver

ENGLISH PETE (OSWALDO)
No hes a passenger The driver lit
out He said he was going to spend the
pligzard shacked up with a friend

John Ruth was more concentrated on pouring his coffy than
listening to English Petes horse shit story

JOHN RUTH
Lucky devil

John Ruth takes a drink of coffy and spits it out

JOHN RUTH
Jesus Christ thats awful

ENGLISH PETE and DOMERGUE
laugh

JOHN RUTH

CAMERA BEHIND PISTOL
He moves the pistol barrel to get the best shot of John Ruth

DOMERGUE
He dont got that problem

JOHN RUTH
Wheres the coffy

ENGLISH PETE(OSWALDO)
There

John Ruth starts making coffy
Giving Grouch Douglass a perfect target of his broad back
JOHN RUTH
So all three of you on the way to Red
Rock when the blizzard stopped ya huh

English Pete catches Domergues eye

With his hand held low he gestures with his fingers for her to
step away from John Ruth (as much as she can)

ENGLISH PETE(OSWALDO)
Yes all three of us were on that
stagecoach out there

Domergue sees the gesture and looks to Petes eyes

JOHN RUTH
Wheres the well water

ENGLISH PETE(OSWALDO)
Right there

Domergues eyes shift over to Grouch and she sees the pistol
pointed at John Ruth

Daisy BLURTS OUT
DOMERGUE

English Petes eyebrows instinctively raise
Grouch changes his mind about shooting John Ruth

JOHN RUTH

CHRIS’ POV

We see straight down the ladder into the underground room

Jody is bleeding and holding his belly on the floor of the
basement Retching in unimaginable pain as the lead ball that
pierced his stomach leaks his gastric juices into his intestinal
track

With his foot Chris Mannix lifts the door and tips it over
shut position

We can still hear Jodys muffled cries of agony down below their
feet

DOMERGUE
You mangy dogs those goddamn rats ‘ill

Maj-Warren and Chris and Joe watch this whole negotiation from
different perspectives

Oswaldo (English Pete) dying in Sweet Daves Chair drops his
foppish accent and says

OSWALDO(ENGLISH PETE)

(to Domergue)
Well we can give ‘em Marco

(to Chris)

DOMERGUE

Now lets say you shoot us all If you
Want all that Domergue Gang bounty money
you still got to get all our corpses into
Red Rock And that aint gonna’ be so
easy Cause I doubt you can drive a
four horse team And that wagon out
there is too heavy for a two horse team
So that means youre gonna hafta lead a
string of horses into Red Rock And with
that deep snow after a blizzard you
aint gonna be able to get away with
any more then one body per horse
So thats YOU leading a string of
FOUR horses into Red Rock
And with all them horses in that snow
and you all by your lonesomeyoure
gonna’ be a mite poky
And your gonna run smack dab into
The Domergue Gang

our dead bodies they aint just gonna’
kill you and that nigger
There gonna go back to Red Rock and kill
every son-ofa-bitch in that town
You really the Sheriff of Red Rock
You wanna save the town
Then shoot that nigger dead

Maj-Warren on the big iron bed FIRES his pistol

Domergues FOOT IS ALMOST BLOWN OFF by MajWarrens pistol

Chris Mannix FIRES a bullet into Joe Gages chest blowing a chunk
out of him and knocking him to the floor

Joe Gage now shot tries to move on his back towards one of the
tables that has a pistol stashed

Domergue curses at Chris
Maj-Warren yells from his bed to kill Joe Gage

Chris FIRES down at Joe on the ground HITTING HIM in the upper
thigh

Joe SCREAMS but gets his hands on the pistol he stashed under
the table brings it up and FIRES

The TWO MEN

One on the floor (Joe) and one standing (Chris) TRADE SHOTS at
each other

FIRING at Chris Joe BLOWS OUT THE FRONT WINDOW — WIND WHIPS IN -
Then Joe SHOOTS Chris TWICE - Once in the RIBS and once in the HIP
- Chris FIRES at Joe Gage - hitting the floor several times before
finally landing a killshot on Joe Gage

Joe Gage dies

aris remains standing but is doubled over in painThen
addenlyhe CRASHES TO THE FLOOR

is PISTOL GOES SLIDING FROM HIS HAND in the middle of the floor

omergue shot sees this
0

Mannix passes out

She moves towards the gun the chain holding her wrist to John
Ruth stops her

MajWarren in bed yells to Chris

MAJ WARREN
You still alive boy

Domergue DRAGS Johns body to a shelf On that shelf she picks up
a hatchet and starts HACKING John Ruths ARM OFF

Maj-Warren in the bed watches this and yells to Chris
MAJ WARREN

Unless your goddamn ass is nailed to the

floor you better wake the fuck up
Domergue has almost CHOPPED THROUGH the arm
Chris EYES FLUTTERhes starting to come to
Domergue after HACKING AWAY at the arm with a hatchet gives it A
FEW GOOD YANKS The Arm is TORN AWAY from John Ruths body Johns
Arm still in the manacle still chained to Domergues wrist
Domergue is FREE

Maj-Warren screams from his bed

MAJ WARREN
Wake up white boy

She rises to her feet
Her EYES go to Chris pistol
Chris shakes the pain out of his head
Domergue makes a RUNNING GRABDIVE for the Pistol
Chris arm comes OUT OF PRAME Picking Up The Pistol COCKING BACK
THE HAMMER and pointing the barrel POINT BLANK in Domergues
face
CHRIS
(to MajWarren)

I aint dead yet you black basterd

Domergue doesn’t move
GI

The WIND POURS INTO the house
Maj-Warren sitting up on his bed says

MAJ WARREN
You know Chris I may have misjudged you

Chris with his pistol barrel in Domergues face

CHRIS
This one did thats for damn sure
(to Domergue)
Now we come to the part of the story
where I blow your head off

MajWarren YELLS from the bed

MAJ WARREN
Dont shoot her Mannix

CHRIS
Why the hell not

MAJ WARREN
John Ruth might of been one mighty mighty
bastard But the best thing that bastard did
‘fore he died was save your life

(beat)
Now with everything thats happened I think
its pretty safe to say the only thing surviving
this blizzard is them rats down there Were
gonna die white boy And we aint got no say
in that But theres one thing left we do have
a say in How we kill this bitch And I say
shootins too good for her If John Ruth wanted
to shoot her he coulda shot her anytime anywhere
along the way But John Ruth was The Hangman
And when The Hangman catches ya you dont die
by a bullet in the face when The Hangman catches
ya you hang

Chris starts to catch MajWarren’s drift

CHRIS

(remembering)
You only need to hang Mean Bastards
But Mean Bastards you need to hang

cuT TO
A HANGMANS NOOSE is put around Domergues neck
Chris throws the rope over the ceiling beam it makes him cringe

Chris leaning against the bed with MajWarrens help HOISTS THE
ROPE

PULLING ON DOMERGUES NECK and lifting her feet off the ground
Domergue KICKS HER FEET
Chris and MajWarren YANK HARD on the rope SCREAMING

Domergue is YANKED WAY UP She hangs by the neck suffocating
while John Ruths wrist hangs off of her chain

DOMERGUES FACE
as the rope cuts in

CHRIS SCREAMS
CHRIS
As my first and final act as the Sheriff
of Red Rock I sentence you Domergue
to hang by the neck until dead
He YANKS the rope again
She goes higher

As she twists and turns Chris ties off the rope and collapses on
the floor

The blistering wind moves the kicking and fighting Domergue around
at the end of the rope

Until she fights and kicks herself out and is just hanging from
the rope dead

Chris on the floor by the bed and MajWarren on the bed look up
and watch her die

After she dies Chris looks up at MajWarren

CHRIS
Hey can I see that Lincoln Letter

MAJ WARREN
Sure
I(6

MajWarren reaches his bloody hand into his jacket and pulls
out the letter smearing red blood all over the white envelope
He hands it to Chris who with dripping red blood hands of his
own takes the envelope opens it up and takes out the letter
smearing blood all over it

Chris reads it as the WIND BLOWS inside Domergue SWINGS from the
rope and Jody SCREAMS as the rats devour him

Just then CEASER The CAT who must of been hiding all this time
finally decides the anxiety in Minnies has calmed down
considerably and jumps up on the bed joining the two men

Hes hungry and makes a hungry sound to the fellas

MajWarren looks over at the cat

MAJ WARREN
Where did you come from

Chris reads

CHRIS
Ole’ Mary Todd Thats a nice touch

MAJ WARREN
Thanks

CUT TO BLACK
