The pack slides toward the OPEN FRONT DOOR Russell screams
Hes about to slide out when the house tilts and the door
swings shut

The Paradise Falls jar rolls past Carl He chases after it

Ellie’s chair slides across the room Carl gasps and runs to
protect it

The photo of Ellie rocks and slides off the wall Carl
lunges to catch it

Russell and Carl fly off the porch and onto the ground They
land hard

Carls house is floating away
Carl runs after the GARDEN HOSE dragging across the ground

CARL
Wait wait No don’t don’t don’t

Carl grabs the hose and is PULLED UP in the air

CARL
Whoah Hey hey

Russell JUMPS onto Carl’s leg and the extra weight pulls them
to the ground

CARL

Carl and Russell slide toward the edge of a CLIFF EDGE

RUSSELL
Whoah

They slide toward the edge and stop The drop is
thousands of feet Carl is TERRIFIED

CARL
Walk back Walk back

RUSSELL
Okay

Russell PULLS Carl by the leg away from the cliff edge
Carl still hanging from the hose looks around

Fog blankets the mysterious landscape revealing only
scattered rocks

CARL
(out of breath)
Where where are we

RUSSELL
This doesn’t look like the city or
the jungle Mr Fredricksen

The wind picks up and they STRUGGLE against it
CARL
(to house)
Don’t worry Ellie I got it

The wind clears the fog slowly revealing a crescent shaped
flat-topped mountain on which they stand

Across it some ten miles away is PARADISE FALLS
Carl stares He can’t believe it
CARL
There it is Ellie it’s so
beautiful

The landscape is stunning

Carl shows Russell the engraving with the Ellie drawing of
the house atop the falls

Something tall blasts through a maze of rocks

Two dark shapes are chasing the prey Each has a light

sinister Doberman Pinscher a Rottweiler and a bulldog each
wearing large HIGH-TECH COLLARS

They surround the prey Escape looks impossible

The dogs head off in pursuit

A HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL stops the dogs short their ears
wincing in pain They whimper and run off

Carl grabs onto Kevin and picks Dug up by the collar

Just as the dogs reach our gang the houses momentum carries
them across the chasm Alpha bites the bird on the leg but
is kicked loose and falls into the river below

are stuck on the other side

and puts Ellie’s drawing back

He looks through the pages remembering the newspaper
clippings and old photographs the dreams of young Ellie

He turns to the page marked STUFF I’M GOING TO DO

Ellie never made it

He closes the book But as he does Carl sees something he
hadn‘t before

The blank pages at the end are no longer blank

their chairs Beneath it Ellie has written

“THANKS FOR THE ADVENTURE -- NOW GO HAVE A NEW ONE
