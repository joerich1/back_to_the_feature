Lilting Pacific Island music plays The soft rhythmic strum
of a guitar Women SING a beautiful harmony

FADE IN

INT SINGAPORE BAR - EVENING 1
A luminous Pacific Island scene — palm trees hula girls and
a crescent of golden sand that borders vibrant ocean
illustrated 1950s style

PULLING BACK to reveal a Pacific tapa cloth pattern bordering
a kitsch lamp-shade

Black Sambuca swirls into a shot glass on a shiny black bar

JAKE SAWYER late 20s handsome and haunted-looking knocks
the shot back and slams the glass down

IN A DARK CORNER OF THE BAR Jake picks up a payphone
receiver His fingers hover over the buttons reluctant to
dial he hangs up

Jake picks up a leather bag from beside his bar stool As he
reaches down we see a long pale scar on his forearm
EXTINT SINGAPORE STREETSSEDAN - NIGHT 2

Rain hammers down as a dark Mercedes sedan rolls through
Singapore’s streets

INSIDE Jake watches the lights blur past the rain-streaked
glass A CHAUFFEUR drives silently

OUTSIDE the bustle gives way to a more stately part of town
the affluent Holland District

EXT MANSION - EVENING 3
The Mercedes pulls up outside an old property The house
reeks of both old money and new Expansive grounds fall away

into darkness beyond the haze of rain

Jake steps out of the car Thunder rolls overhead as he looks
up at the house
INT MANSION FOYER - NIGHT 4

The Chauffeur shows Jake into a marbled foyer A staircase
sweeps up into darkness Jake shivers

A figure descends the stairs MR LIM is silver haired and
slight He looks like he hasn’t slept in weeks He extends a
hand

MR LIM
Edward Lim

JAKE
Jake Sawyer

Jake shakes Mr Lim’s hand As he does we see that the back
of Jake’s hand is covered with intricate tattoos

MR LIM
Thank you for coming

INT MANSION LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 5

A well-appointed living room mahogany and leather pools of
shadow Jake sits in an armchair flipping through a worn-
looking leather journal Mr Lim paces wringing his hands

MR LIM
Have you ever encountered a bad
spirit Mr Sawyer

JAKE
(under his breath)
Almost every night

MR LIM
It is eating him from within So
strong so hungry

Unseen by Mr Lim Jake rolls his eyes He hands Mr Lim the
journal We can’t see what’s on the page

JAKE
This is what you need

MR LIM

(impressed)
How did you get this

( )

JAKE
(grins)
Ed you worry about your karma let
me worry about mine

MR LIM
It’s powerful

JAKE
(laying it on thick)
And strictly forbidden I’m taking
a big risk giving this to him
Mr Lim hands Jake an envelope Jake looks inside

MR LIM
It is enough

Jake’s eyes glint in triumph it’s more than enough
JAKE

Where is he
INT MANSION HALLWAY - NIGHT 6
Mr Lim leads Jake up a long shadowy hallway Jake approaches
the door as if this creepy setting is all in a day’s work
Lim opens the door
INT MANSION BEDROOM - NIGHT 7

Jake steps into the room Candles flicker incense burns The
walls and ceiling are scrawled with Chinese symbols

A YOUNG BOY sits up on the bed He looks flu-ridden and
miserable Breath rattles as his scrawny chest rises and
falls

Seeing the child Jake looks taken aback — clearly this
wasn’t what he expected

From behind him the sound of rapid CRUNCHING FOOTSTEPS
Jake turns —

EXT SAWYER HOUSE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 8

Footsteps crunch through snow

( )

A slender teenager runs towards a dark house YOUNG JAKE
Behind him a dark treeline Out of breath he looks back
afraid —

INT MANSION BEDROOM - NIGHT 9
Jake blinks Mr Lim watches him from the doorway

JAKE
You never said he was a kid

He looks back at the sick boy

JAKE (CONTD)
Have you seen a doctor

MR LIM
This isn’t something a doctor can
cure but you can Can’t you

Jake wrestles with this then nods

JAKE
If that’s the way you want to go

MR LIM
We must be prepared to do anything
for our loved ones Even if it
causes them pain
(to the boy)
This is the man I told you about
He’s here to help us

Jake sits down beside the boy clearly uneasy
JAKE
Hey kid I’m Jake What’s your
name
The boy watches him wide-eyed fearful
JAKE (CONTD)
(smiles )

Strong and silent type huh

BOY
Is this going to hurt

Another flicker of guilt crosses Jake’s face

( )

JAKE
Your Dad thinks it’s going to help
you get better

BOY
What do you think

Jake meets the boy’s eyes then looks away unable to lie
Jake opens his bag A TATTOOIST’S NEEDLE is deftly assembled
He skims through the notebook images of hand-drawn symbols
flutter past

Jake’s needle BUZZES The tattoo takes shape under its point
an ancient Thai symbol lines etched with skill and
precision

Jake wipes blood and ink from the child’s skin He glances up
to see that the boy is sobbing quietly His father holds the
boy’s wrists tightly his knuckles white He whispers
desperate assurances to the boy in Malay

Behind the boy’s sobs a ROAR builds —

INT SAWYER BASEMENT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 10
Shivering with fear Young Jake huddles against a cracked
grimy mirror in a dark basement corner Beside him an iron
boiler roars and rattles TIC-TIC-TIC-TIC

A DARK FIGURE looms its reflection fragmented in the mirror
A BLADE flashes slices SKIN BLOOD wells —

Young Jake SCREAMS —

INT MANSION HALLWAY - NIGHT 11

The scream seems to reverberate around the tight hallway as
Jake steps out of the bedroom bag in hand He looks back —

Beyond Mr Lim kneels at his son’s bedside in prayer Jake
turns away and strides up the hall his expression grim

CUSTOMER (VO)
Hey
EXT SINGAPORE TATTOO EXPOJAKE’S BOOTH - DAY 12

The sprawling bustle of a convention a multi-cultural
microcosm of booths stages showcases and tents

( )

12

A banner reads TATTOO EXPO 2007 in both English and Chinese
Music booms

Jake hesitates needle hovering over a partially completed
tattoo around a skinny forearm The design is striking
tribal motifs in black ink

CUSTOMER
Hey

JAKE
Huh

His wiry Singaporean CUSTOMER looks up at him nervous

CUSTOMER
I said is this for real

Jake slips effortlessly back into salesman mode

JAKE
You ever hear of a Dayak tribesman
with carpal tunnel syndrome

Jake continues tattooing

Behind them a sign above Jake’s stall reads MYSTICAL TATTOOS
FOR PROTECTION AND WELL-BEING Posters show ethnic designs
and their promised effect GOUT RHEUMATISM HEMORRHOIDS and
more

Ethnic tattooing tools decorate the walls an attempt to lend
the display some credibility

CUSTOMER
Big night last night huh

JAKE
Nothing I can’t handle

CUT TO
Jake stuffs his tools into his bag He shoulders it looks up
to see a figure watching him MR LIM If he looked sleep-
deprived the night before he now looks positively zombified

MR LIM
Your tattoo did not work

JAKE

(quietly)
It was just a tattoo

( ) 12

MR LIM
Then the fault is yours

Evasive Jake looks around to see who might be listening

JAKE

(quietly)
Listen you believe in I Ching
Feng Shui or faery folk that’s
your business but next time
your kid gets sick you really want
him to get better take him to a
doctor

Jake pushes past Lim and disappears into the crowd Mr Lim
stares after Jake trembling with rage

INT SINGAPORE TATTOO EXPO - DAY 13
Jake glances back over his shoulder as he pushes through the

crowd Mr Lim is still following him Jake slips between two
booths —

Ahead is a large tent TAP-TAP-TAP The sound emanates from
darkness TAP-TAP-TAP Jake ducks inside

INT SAMOAN TENT - DAY 14
Jake stands in the shadows of the tent entrance watching the
crowd pass by No sign of Mr Lim Behind him the TAP-TAP-TAP
continues

A young woman SINA watches Jake from the shadows of the
tent She’s in her early 20s beautiful a red hibiscus
flower behind her ear

Her eyes travel to the scar on his arm

SINA
Can I help you

Jake turns to see her In awe and off-guard he struggles to
find his voice

JAKE
I don’t know Maybe

ALIPATI (0S)
Sina

( )

14

Sina disappears into the darkness of the tent towards the
source of the sound Jake watches after her then follows
The main area of the tent is bathed in the soft glow of
candlelight Soft Pacific dub plays from an old boom-box

Jake steps forward captivated

SEMO (early 20s) lies half-naked amid the other men An
incredible tattoo in progress spreads across his buttocks and
down his legs THE PE’A a traditional Samoan tatau The
tattooist leans over him ALIPATI’s lean body is coiled like
a spring shining with sweat

Sina sits down beside Semo and begins to massage his temples
She whispers in his ear soothing

Dark ink is poured thick like blood A bone tool is dipped
Skin is stretched taut One of the onlookers PENI holds
Semo’s skin taut for Alipati —

TAP-TAP-TAP Another tool falls and black ink spatters then
is wiped away to reveal the vivid lines of tatau beneath A
general sense of calm of serene concentration

Jake’s eyes pick up other details a single tear runs down
Semo’s cheek The ragged hitch of his breathing Alipati
leans to whisper in Semo’s ear

ALIPATI (CONTD)
Time out brutha

Semo moves to sit up leans on Alipati for support

Their heads touch and they share each other’s breath before
Semo nods and manages to sit up Jake watches this exchange
of trust astonished — he’s never seen a tattooing experience
shared so powerfully

Sina watches as Jake takes this all in enjoying the
impression the display is making

JAKE
(impressed)
Jesus
Alipati looks up notices Jake
ALIPATI

You looking for him you got the
wrong tent

( ) 14

Alipati gets to his feet His full pe’a wraps around his
thighs and torso dazzling in its intricacy the spaces
between the ink luminous in the golden light

ALIPATI (CONT’D)
Flash tats bro — got something to
prove

Jake nods towards Alipati’s tatau

JAKE
What about you

ALIPATI
You get the pe’a you don’t gotta
prove nothing to anyone ever

again

JAKE
This is from the South Pacific
right

ALIPATI

Samoan tatau outta Auckland

JAKE
New Zealand

Jake looks around A DISPLAY of ancient tattooing TOOLS bone
and wood bound with flax is carefully arranged on a tapa
cloth draped over a desk to one side They look as though
they haven’t been used for many years

Jake picks up a bone tool from the display at peers at it
The points are needle-sharp

JAKE (CONTD)
Do they have any medicinal value
You know protection healing that
kind of thing

ALIPATI
(scoffs)
You mean like ‘Tattoos for
Protection and Wellbeing’
Jake grins good-natured but nevertheless defensive

JAKE
Hey a man’s got to make a living

Alipati approaches Jake his gaze intense

( )

14 14

ALIPATI
This ain’t just a living You get
the pe’a to honour the spirits of
your tupuaga who wore it before
you You get it to honour your
father And your father’s father

JAKE
What if your father isn’t worth
honouring

Alipati narrows his eyes nods as if Jake has just given
away some crucial detail Sina watches interested

Jake takes a step back as Alipati leans in close his voice
soft emphatic

ALIPATI
The pain of the tatau it changes
you You breathe into it accept
it learn from it Only then can
you find a way through

Alipati’s hand snaps out and grabs Jake’s wrist turns it
over to reveal the livid scar on Jake’s inner arm Alipati
nods as though the scar confirms his suspicions about Jake

ALIPATI (CONTD)
You know what I’m talking about
You seen pain Only you ain’t
found a way through yours eh

These words strike Jake seem to sink in then
defensiveness kicks in He tries to pull away

JAKE
I’m just looking for some styles to
do

ALIPATI
That ain’t all you’re looking for

(beat)
Sometimes it’s right in front of
your eyes brutha You just gotta
open them

Jake yanks his arm from Alipati’s grip eyes blazing with
anger Alipati smirks and turns away as if unsurprised by
Jake’s reaction

Jake turns to leave fuming

( ) 14

ALIPATI (CONT’D)
(his back to Jake)
It was a rose With a barb wire

stem
Jake freezes for a moment eyes wide then steps out of
the tent
INT SINGAPORE TATTOO EXPO - DAY 15

Outside the tent Jake looks down — he still holds the bone
and wood tool he was looking at before

With a last glance back towards the tent he stuffs it into
his pocket and strides away

INT SINGAPORE BAR - EVENING 16

Jake is back in his spot at the bar a shot of Sambuca in
front of him Behind him the post-convention crowd is a blur
of leather ink and pierced flesh under black-light and neon

Jake seems disconnected from the world his expression
distant as he toys absently with the tool he stole Despite
the crowd he is alone

A heavily-tattooed middle-aged man leans over

TATTOOED PUNTER
Lemme guess — tattoo me with that
and my dick’1l grow four inches
overnight

JAKE
You never know

Jake turns away to see Mr Lim pushing through the bar
towards him He looks for an exit but he’s cornered

JAKE (CONTD)
Look what do you want — a refund

MR LIM
If you don’t believe your actions
have no power They can cause
only pain

JAKE
Don’t talk to me about pain

( )

16 16

MR LIM
My son died this morning

This hits Jake like a hammer He looks away trying to make
sense of this

JAKE
He’s dead

MR LIM
Now do you understand what you’ve
done
JAKE
(weakly)
God I’m sorry

MR LIM
You will be

Jake looks down —
The blade of a knife flicks open catches the light —

Jake stumbles back against the bar crashing into other

patrons
Jake scrabbles for purchase he falls bringing the
Polynesian lamp from the bar crashing down with him POP

The bulb shatters and the lamp goes dark

His point made Mr Lim stands over Jake and looks down on
him On the floor Jake looks wretched at the end of the
line

JAKE
Go on then do it

Lim’s anger seems to fade leaving only pity for Jake
MR LIM
Perhaps a man who believes in
nothing is already dead
Mr Lim pushes away through the crowd
Jake looks up dazed to see patrons staring down at him
Among them is the Tattooed Punter — he shakes his head in

disgust and turns away

Jake frowns noticing —

( ) 16

BLOOD drips from his clenched fist He opens it to reveal the
Samoan tool Its needle points have bitten deep into his
palm

The noise of the bar is pushed into the distance TAP-TAP-TAP
TAP-TAP-TAP The sound of the Samoan tattooist at work
Polynesian voices united in song strangely menacing

We PUSH IN on the lamp lying on its side next to Jake
towards its now dark scene of Pacific kitsch The sounds of
tatau in progress intensify

INT DREAM — VARIOUS 17

TAP-TAP-TAP Samoan tattooing tools work dark skin leaving
their dense pattern of ink and blood A distinctive tapa
cloth design Beyond flax matting disappears into shadow
TAP-TAP-TAP

JAKES NEEDLE etches the last of the Chinese symbol onto Mr
Lim’s son The young boy’s eyes are open bloodshot glazed
and dilated Dead

YOUNG JAKE huddles in the shadows The boiler’s ticking is
indistinguishable from the sound of the tattooing tools The
dark figure looms

DARK FIGURE
Youve brought shame on our house

A KNIFE BLADE glows red-hot against the boiler

ALIPATI (0S)
(distant distorted)
You seen pain Only you ain’t
found a way through yours

The movement of the tattooing tools becomes frenzied A fist
clenches in pain blood flows TAP-TAP-TAP The lines
of pe’a are black vivid — graphic patterns wrap around the
curve of a body in extreme close up —

ALIPATI (0S) (CONT’D)
(distant distorted)
Sometimes it’s right in front of
your eyes brutha You just gotta —

The TAPPING of the tools swirls around him as he sits bolt
upright on his bed in a shitty neon-lit hotel room His
chest heaving Jake looks across to the bedside table and
the tool he stole from the Samoans

INT SINGAPORE TATTOO EXPO - NIGHT 19
Booths are being dismantled and packed away Jake appears at

EXT BEDLAM TATTOO STUDIO - DAY 24
Elaborate signage announces BEDLAM in stylised manga-style
script Below the entrance to what could only be one fucking
cool tattoo studio Jake looks up at the sign

INT BEDLAM TATTOO STUDIO - DAY 25
Extensive mirrors create an illusion of depth TATTOO ARTISTS

the decor extend to the tattoos which seem accomplished but
soulless generic McTattoos for trendsetters

Jake looks around impressed

guilty of this offence

Jake and Crash sit on comfortable-looking couches in Crash’s
impeccably-designed designer office the magazine open on the
coffee table in front of them Crash is on a roll

CRASH

The Pacific it’s the heartland of
tattooing — the wellspring the
source The word ‘tattoo’ they
invented it the Samoans the
Fijians those guys It’s the
wellspring — I say that already
And that’s good for my brand value

hell I just traded in the
Boxster for a Bentley But it don’t
make it any of your business

JAKE
Why not

CRASH
Cause it’s not in your blood This
guy Alipati — he’s hard-core you
know that right He ain’t just
gonna hand generations of tradition
down to some kid from Buttfuck
Minnesota who thinks he’s had some
kind of epiphany

Jake looks away frustrated

CRASH (CONTD)
Anyway the old Jake wouldn’t have
asked — he’d have just stolen the
designs and made out like he’d been
doing Samoan tattoos his whole
life

JAKE
(grins)
Was the old Jake that much of an
asshole

CRASH

I kind of liked him Egocentric
Pissed off Self-destructive

JAKE
Should’ve been around when he went
downhill
CRASH

You know the only thing that sets
one tattoo apart from another is
the guy doing the work Skill -
that’s what matters

(beat)
Come work for me again

JAKE
That’s not what I came here for
Crash

CRASH

community offers sharp contrast to the roar of downtown

flowers and Pacific-style clothes everywhere we look the
landscape seems to burst with the colour of life

INTEXT TAXIOTARA MARKETS - AFTERNOON 29

watches mesmerised as she laughs and hugs the woman then
walks away

Jake follows Passersby jostle him as he pushes against the
flow of the crowd Jake darts between stalls into another
identical row He spins trying to get his bearings The
bustling maze of the market closes in on him trinkets
clothes and fruit stalls

something you regret

She leads him through the market a familiar sound floats
above the others TAP-TAP-TAP TAP-TAP-TAP

INTEXT ALIPATI’S GARAGE - DAY 31

A back corner of the market where canvas stalls give way to
the backs of shops and storage areas

In one of them Alipati works his back to Jake Semo who we
saw being worked on in Singapore sits at the head of another
a young man being tattooed OPETA muttering encouragement

Peni and the other guys from the expo hang out on folding
chairs and mats

PENT

Alipati notices Jake and Sina and sighs
ALIPATI
Every expo there’s some palagi
wants to be down with the brown

of the stall a tattooing tool in his hand He glares at
Sina She shrugs

JAKE
That stuff I said I —

ALIPATI
You came all the way to Otara to
apologise Those suckers must pay
you heaps

Laughter Jake looks around nervously

JAKE
You said what I was looking for was
right in front of me I didn’t
understand But I do now and all
that other bullshit it’s finished
I want something real I want
you to teach me

ALIPATI
That what you thought I meant

JAKE
Ever since Singapore I’ve been
thinking about it dreaming
about it

ALIPATI

I told you tatau is about more than
a living It don’t start here —
(holds up the tool then
taps his chest)
It starts here

JAKE
I know I’m ready

ALIPATI
It ain’t skills you need brother

Alipati turns away

JAKE
But I’ve come a long way

ALIPATI
Not from what I can see

Jake watches Alipati helpless He sighs and turns away

Sina watches as Jake disappears into the market crowd

( ) 31

ALIPATI (CONTD)

(to Sina)
You should know better bringing
him here
SINA
I don’t know there’s something
about him Ali He’s not like the
others

Alipati looks at her sharply

ALIPATI
You want to go down that road
Sina Your uncle ain’t gonna like
it that’s for sure

Sina nods — he’s got that right

ALIPATI (CONT’D)
and neither do I

Sina meets his gaze then runs to catch up with Jake
Alipati watches after her concerned

SINA
Wait up

EXT OTARA STREETS - LATE AFTERNOON 32
Jake and Sina walk side by side through suburban streets

SINA
Alipati’s old-school traditional
They say he can see a tatau before
he does it That the spirits tell
him what’s supposed to be there

Jake looks down at his scar

JAKE
Or what was

SINA
Tataus his life — he thinks it’s
up to him to protect it

JAKE
From what

SINA
From guys like you

EXT MR VAA’S HOUSE - EVENING 33

A weatherboard state house among other weatherboard state
houses A large hibiscus bush dominates the front of the
house Jake follows Sina up the path towards the door He
looks across —

Inside the house next-door an elderly Samoan woman covers a
mirror with tapa cloth

JAKE
What’s she doing

SINA
She’s covering the mirror for the
night so bad spirits don’t get her

JAKE
Are you serious

SINA
I lived with my Grandma for a while
in Apia There was all sorts of
things we weren’t allowed to do
Whistling inside brushing your
hair or laughing at night

JAKE
And you believe all that stuff

SINA
Maybe I mean I go to church But
Alipati’s taught me a lot about the
old ways

JAKE
Best of both worlds huh

SINA
For now

They arrive at the porch

SINA (CONTD)
Why did you come here Jake To
learn tatau from Alipati

JAKE
I’ve done things I’m not proud of
And meeting you guys it felt
like —

( )

She takes

SINA
What fate

JAKE
That’s not what I —

his hand runs her fingertips across his scar
SINA

A guy with a scar like this has to
believe in something right

Their eyes meet Then Jake pulls his arm away

JAKE
Talk to Alipati for me

SINA
Jake

JAKE
I don’t want to take it away from
him It’s his art and I respect
that All I want to do is watch
and learn

SINA
(at last)
Okay

Jake grins

SINA (CONTD)
Now if my uncle comes home from
church and finds a palagi boy on
the doorstep he’ll kick me all the
way back to Sa Literally

Sina disappears inside

Jake looks along the side of the house The back garden looks
immaculate lush wild with banana palms and flowers A
corrugated iron shed is visible brooding in the darkness

Sina reappears

SINA (CONTD)
Give me a couple of days Ill talk
to him But come see me at work
okay Not round here

She hands Jake a piece of paper then takes the red flower
from her hair and hands it to him before closing the door
Jake grins then starts down the path

TAP-TAP-TAP Jake pauses listening TAP-TAP-TAP

EXT GARDEN - NIGHT 34

TAP-TAP-TAP Jake approaches the shed and cups his hand
against a dark window The sound emanates from the darkness
inside

The sound of a car pulling up Headlights sweep across the
lawn Jake looks around — where to run

A car door SLAMS CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH the heavy
tread of a man coming up the path towards the house

Jake backs slowly around the side of the shed A MACHETE
leans against the shed wall Jake kicks it over The blade
clatters against the corrugated iron Jake freezes

A dark shape on the path — a huge man his head cocked
massive hands hanging by his sides He strides towards the
shed and pushes the door open

MR VA’A stands in the shed doorway and peers into the
darkness He wears a faitaga and churchgoing jacket with a
silver crucifix around his neck Mere inches away Jake
cowers against the shed wall

Mr Va’a closes the door behind him and heads into the house
The door SLAMS behind him Jake sighs with relief

PAT-PAT PAT Jake looks down droplets of fresh blood hit
the grass The wound on his palm is bleeding

TAP-TAP-TAP The tattooing sound again from inside Jake
peers through the window
INT SHED - NIGHT — DREAM 35

The darkness through the shed window becomes a tunnel dim
candlelight in the distance

A man lies face-down on flax mats moaning softly A

silhouette crouches over him bony hands working tattooing
tools TAP-TAP-TAP

( )

35

A partially-completed pe’a design on the man’s back the
long sharp points of an ulalei a ceremonial necklace of
whale-tooth

Something’s wrong The man gasps his breath a deathly
rattle The song begins to waver and crackle as though
playing off an old record The tattoo cracks and festers as
fresh lines split and weep The ulalei is streaked with blood
and ink

The recipient turns his head — it’s Jake The hammering
intensifies and he tries to ward off the blows Mighty CLANGS
continue as tattooed skin ruptures blood and ink run
together Jake gasps for breath

Blood blooms a red hibiscus the blood clouds outwards
a horribly bloodshot eye its pupil fixed and dilated

Jake tries to pull away from the blows The images merge and
shift the tattooist the rose tattoo Mr Lim’s son’s dead
eyes the nightmare pe’a in progress the ink the ulalei
the blood the hibiscus flower —

Jake SCREAMS —

INT APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT 36

Jake sits up in bed breathing hard Lights from the street
dance through the shadows He opens his hand to find
Sina’s red hibiscus flower crushed against dried blood on
his palm

INT APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 37
A small bathroom with a large mirror Behind Jake a shower
alcove with a frosted glass door He bandages his hand then
fills a glass with water

INT APARTMENT BEDROOM - DAWN 38
The first pale rays of dawn creep into the bedroom

A MURMURING UNDERCURRENT of the dream’s cacophony Jake sits
on the bed deep in thought his gaze fixed on —

The red hibiscus its stem resting in the glass of water on
the bedside table As the dawn creeps towards it its petals
begin to revive

INT BEDLAM TATTOO STUDIO - DAY 39

The sound of buzzing needles fills the air Crash heads
towards an empty workspace the Tattooist Magazine in hand

Crash tears out the page with Jake on it and tapes it to the
mirror then turns to Jake with a smile of triumph

JAKE
Crash take that down

CRASH
There’s the book

JAKE
No original designs

CRASH
Get to work

He points Jake looks across to see LUKE a Singaporean
teenager cool but nerdishly so

Nearby a young Singaporean woman checks out the images of
Bedlam’s work This is VICTORIA (early 20s) She’s attractive
and wearing what looks like a conservatively pretty dress

Jake approaches Luke

JAKE
Hey I’m Jake

Victoria turns holds out her hand

VICTORIA
Victoria

Jake is taken aback to see graphic tattoos snaking out from
under her dress

VICTORIA (CONTD)
Crash says you could be the next

big thing
JAKE
Which one of you guys
VICTORIA
(points to Luke)
Oh Luke my cousin Sorry Do
you mind if I watch Check out your

stuff

( )

39

JAKE
(uncomfortable)
Okay

Luke holds out the Bedlam design book open to a page Jake
glances at it then takes the book and closes it

VICTORIA
Aren’t you gonna use the book

Jake pulls on his latex gloves

JAKE
(quietly)
You want something cool or not

Luke grins

JAKE (CONTD)
This is gonna hurt You man enough

LUKE
I’m eighteen on Saturday

JAKE
Then I guess you got nothing to
worry about

Jake smiles at Victoria She smiles back clearly infatuated

Jake’s needle begins to BUZZ an outline emerges
geometric shapes then deep blocks of colour richly
shaded

Victoria watches Jake intently His eyes flick to her
conscious of her attention acknowledging it Busted
Victoria looks away

Finally Jake snaps off his rubber gloves He steps back to
admire the finished design It’s discreet but stunning a nod
to the Bedlam aesthetic but something more with colour that
gives the image a bold luminosity

Luke turns his shoulder towards the mirror and smiles

VICTORIA
Where have you been hiding

JAKE
Singapore

LUKE
No shit — that’s where we’re from

( )

39 39

Jake smiles — no shit

LUKE (CONT’D)
What were you doing there

JAKE
Avoiding questions Use moisturiser
every day keep it out of the sun
and try not to get it wet okay

Luke takes out his wallet Jake shakes his head

JAKE (CONTD)
On the house — birthday present

LUKE
You serious

JAKE
Get outta here before Crash changes
my mind

Luke gets off the chair reaches into his jacket and hands
Jake a folded piece of paper

LUKE
I’m having a party on Friday night
my folks’ place It won’t be lame
they got a pool and stuff

Jake takes the invite Victoria smiles at him intent

VICTORIA
He’1l be there

A couple of the Bedlam employees smirk watching the scene
Self-conscious Jake hands the invite back

JAKE
I got plans Friday

Victoria shrugs — suit yourself — and leaves with Luke
turning before they reach the door to look back at Jake one
last time Crash appears

CRASH

What is this a charity or a dating
agency

( ) 39
JAKE
You gonna take the picture down or
not
CUT TO

A BAND OF TATTOO ART is etched around a large forearm subtly
echoing the geometric forms of tatau

Jake frowns looks down A miniature poodle sits at his feet

The customer is GRAHAM a burly league player turned
businessman He wears expensive suit trousers and Italian
leather shoes at odds with his cauliflower ears

Jake leans in to resume the tattoo then stops again
Grahams trophy girlfriend CHANEL admires him from the
counter her eyes travelling admiringly across his tattoos
She chews gum

GRAHAM
I’m getting this for her Eh
pumpkin Got a thing about tattooed
fellas

CHANEL
Graham

Chanel leans down to retrieve the poodle a manoeuvre clearly
designed to reveal maximum cleavage Jake stands back to give
her room

Jake starts work once again We look away to the bustling
studio as the needle BUZZES

his hand black and thick like ink
INT BEDLAM TATTOO STUDIOBATHROOM - DAY 40
An immaculate bathroom out the back of the studio At the

basin Jake pulls away the bandage Black ink mixes with the
water and swirls away down the drain

Sudden movement in the mirror — a dark figure barely
glimpsed in the reflection Jake spins but the room is
empty He turns back to the basin creeped out

EXT BACK ALLEY - DAY 41

A grimy back-alley behind Bedlam Tattoo Studio Jake stares
car keys in hand

JAKE
Oh man

THE COMPANY CAR is just that a late-model Japanese import

covered with Bedlam-style tattoo designs — a mobile billboard
for Bedlam and seriously uncool

INTEXT JAKE’S CAROTARA STREETS —- DAY 42

the numbers

JAKE
Nineteen twenty-one

Jake slows the car

JAKE (CONTD)
Twenty-three Jesus

Jake looks aghast It’s a church

INT CHURCHARCHIVE — DAY 43

Storage shelves loom stacked with boxes and piles of paper
Barely organised chaos

OSONE wears cool street clothes at odds with the depth
behind his eyes He fishes a faded photo from a box full of

old pictures He studies the faces He seems both intent on

the image and distant as though focussing beyond it

OSONE
Mr Palauni

He passes the photo to Sina who looks at it

SINA
How did you know that

( )

43

OSONE
Seen him round eh

SINA
He died before you were born

Sina wears a conservative blouse and skirt as she stacks
bulging archival boxes As she lifts one the bottom drops
out of it and photos spill across the floor

Jake watches from the doorway amused

JAKE
Bugger

SINA
Glad to see you’re making an effort
to learn the language

Jake kneels and helps Sina put the photos back in the box
Osone stares eyes wide over Jake’s shoulder — as if looking
at someone behind him

Jake follows his gaze — no-one there He looks back

JAKE
Hey

Osone edges out of the room as if he’s trying to stay as far
away from Jake as he can while he does it Jake shrugs and
flips through the pictures family group shots people in
churchgoing attire and ceremonial dress

JAKE (CONTD)
So this is what you do when you’re
not giving scalp massages

SINA
There’s forty years of South
Auckland stories in this room My
uncle’s trying to make sure they
don’t get lost

JAKE
Looks like you’re the one doing all
the work

SINA

It’s the least I can do to repay
him for everything he’s done for
me

SINA (CONTD)
I have to go pick up some more
photos You want to come

JAKE

INT CHURCH HALLWAY — DAY 44

Sina leads Jake down a hallway towards the church foyer Jake
looks uncomfortable

SINA
You okay

JAKE
If I’d known I was going to church
Id have worn something less
comfortable

Jake pauses looking through the main doors to the church
Glass panels offer a view of the pews and the altar beyond
Mr Va’a stands in the aisle talking with an elderly
MINISTER

JAKE (CONTD)
Your uncle huh

SINA
You’ve met him

JAKE
Not really

A middle-aged PARISHIONER approaches Mr Va’a and the
Minister Mr Va’a takes her hands warmly and smiles She
beams at him

SINA
He’s not really my uncle — after my
mum died Mr Va’a’s wife took me
in Now he’s alone too But he
lets me stay

Va’a turns looks through the glass He sees Sina and smiles
then notices Jake His smile fades Jake looks nervous

SINA (CONTD)
What about your folks Where are
they

JAKE
Theyre dead

Sina looks at him differently now like she understands
something about him

EXT PERENESE HOUSE - DAY 45

Ragged graffiti has been sprayed across an unpainted wooden
fence several of its boards smashed in A car sits rusting
and abandoned in a concrete driveway weeds growing through
the cracks Nearby a letterbox lies on its side

Beyond is a weathered state house its curtains drawn its
welcome cold It’s as though someone sucked all the colour
out of this corner of Otara An unseen dog WHINES mournfully
an eerie soundtrack to this grim landscape

Jake follows Sina from his car up towards the front door
Sina knocks The door opens a crack to reveal suspicious
eyes

SINA
Malo Mr Perenese it’s Sina

It opens MR PERENESE silver-haired middle-aged wearing a
faded T-shirt over old suit pants glares at Jake — then
softens as he turns to Sina

PERENESE
Talofa Sina Come in

INT PERENESE HALLWAY - DAY 46

The carpet is threadbare the wallpaper stained yellow by
nicotine The house feels heavy with neglect Nooks and
crannies disappear into shadow

SINA
This is my friend Jake

JAKE
How you doing

Jake smiles and extends a hand Mr Perenese takes it for a
second barely making eye contact

PERENESE
(to Sina)
You’re here for the pictures I put
them in a box for you

Mr Perenese leads Sina away down the hall towards the front
of the house Jake stands in the hallway awkward

( )

He picks up an old framed photo blows off the dust it looks
a hundred years old a Samoan man crouching in ceremonial
dress a traditional whale-tooth ulalei around his neck

A cockroach scuttles across the carpet into the kitchen

INT PERENESE KITCHEN - DAY 47

Jake steps into the kitchen as the roach scuttles away
A chipped formica table and windows cracked and stained
A simple wooden crucifix hangs on the wall

INT PERENESE HALLWAYBEDROOM - DAY 48

Unnerved Jake steps back out into the hallway From the
living room the sound of muffled voices Jake catches sight
of something in a room off the hallway a portrait photo of a
young woman on a shelf above a neatly-made bed

Jake pushes the door open further

A second portrait also of a young woman is revealed Then
another and another Jake pushes the door open further

A middle-aged Samoan woman MRS PERENESE sits in a chair in
front of a dresser her lined face reflected in a large
round mirror She pulls a brush slowly through her long
greying hair Her eyes swivel to look at Jake in the mirror

JAKE
Excuse me I didn’t mean to

She regards him with her unblinking stare eyes empty with
sadness
INT PERENESE LIVING ROOM - DAY 49

Grey light filters through the drawn curtains Everything in
this room seems to languish in its place

SINA
They’1l be looked after Mr
Perenese

PERENESE
Old memories no use to me

Mr Perenese bends to lift a cardboard box The back of his T-
shirt rides up revealing his pe’a beneath Jake notices it
with interest Perenese follows his gaze

( )

49 49

Mr Perenese’s eyes blaze with sudden anger

PERENESE (CONT’D)
You get a good look eh boy

JAKE
I’m a tattoo artist

PERENESE
So what
(to Sina in Samoan)
Sina why you bring this palagi to
my house

SINA

Perenese glares from Sina to Jake

PERENESE
Take the pictures and go

50 INTEXT JAKES CAROTARA STREETS - DAY 50
Jake drives Sina next to him

JAKE
I thought a pe’a was something to
be proud of

SINA
Not for him One of their kids ran
away years ago and the community
turned their backs on them

JAKE
And what he just accepted that

SINA
He had no choice It made them look
like bad parents — around here
that’s a mark of shame

They pull up outside the church Jake looks up at the
crucifix that graces its roof his expression dark

JAKE
Maybe they deserved it A kid
doesn’t run away unless there’s
something he’s running away from

Sina watches him sensing his pain

( )

50

SINA
What happened to you Jake

Jake’s expression darkens

JAKE
So you talk to Alipati

SINA
(sighs)
Yeah Jake I’m sorry but he —

JAKE
Tell him he can name his price

SINA
What

JAKE
Tell him whatever he wants to teach
me I’ll pay it

SINA
Jake tatau isn’t just some cure
you can buy and sell

She gets out of the car and slams the door She looks back in
the window

SINA (CONTD)
Don’t come back here okay

Jake watches Sina walk through the church gates He slams the
car into gear and throws it into a U-turn The car swings
around —

Osone stands right in his path Jake slams on the brakes

EXT STREET — DAY 51

Jake leaps out of the car and crosses to where Osone stands
in the road The boy stares at him unruffled

JAKE
Are you okay I didn’t even —

OSONE
You see him

Jake looks around

( )

51

JAKE
Who

OSONE
Following you round

JAKE
There’s no one there

OSONE
Just cause you don’t see no one
don’t mean there ain’t no one
there

Osone points Baffled Jake follows the boy’s gaze to where
black ink runs freely from the cut on his hand

Hip-hop bass pounds ahead of a sedan as it pulls up beside
them A tinted window rolls down to reveal a large Samoan man
in his early twenties Sitting next to him his brother
Osone’s COUSINS

Osone runs to the car and gets in The car peels away bass
thumping Jake watches them go bewildered

INT JAKE’S APARTMENT - EVENING 52
Jake enters the apartment and slams the door behind him his
expression stormy The sound of WATER RUNNING Jake follows
it

INT JAKE’S APARTMENTBATHROOM - EVENING 53
Jake steps up to the bathroom door Inside someone splashes
in the shower He hesitates a moment then pushes the door

open

Victoria’s head is visible above the shower door the rest of
her body obscured She YELPS in surprise

JAKE
Shit

Jake ducks back outside He leans against the wall The water
is shut off

Jake peers around the edge of the door Victoria is drying
herself

( )

53

She’s covered in striking tattoos the unmistakable Bedlam
aesthetic Jake’s eyes widen He ducks back out of sight

JAKE (CONTD)
You always take a shower after you
sneak into someone’s place

Victoria emerges from the bathroom She’s wearing vinyl
pants boots a tiny top that reveals every tattoo — she
looks ready to enter the matrix Jake stares

VICTORIA
Only when I’m dirty There’s Stoli
in the freezer see if we can’t

loosen you up a bit before we go

JAKE
Where

VICTORIA
Luke’s party remember

She sweeps past him Jake watches helplessly

INT JAKE’S APARTMENT - EVENING 54

Jake and Victoria sit on the couch drinking vodka on ice
Her cigarette trails smoke

VICTORIA
What did you think the island
princess was just going to hand
over the Samoan instruction book

JAKE
I thought they’d be flattered I
wanted to learn from them

VICTORIA
Well I think you can do better
than a garage in Otara Mr
Tattooist Magazine

JAKE
I guess I was doing okay before I
came here I was travelling the
world Making money

Victoria puts her glass down and straddles him stroking his
chest

( )

attractive quality in a tattooist

Victoria takes off her top Jake puts his hands on her waist
moves them up towards her bra She grabs his wrists

A tribal design in greys and blacks encircling Victoria’s

EXT SUBURBAN HOME BACKYARD - NIGHT 56

A pool-side barbecue for Luke’s birthday Teenage BOYS and
GIRLS laugh shout and drink Some splash in the water

A few posers sit around in shades and designer clothes too
cool for the pool

Food sizzles on a barbeque that looks like something NASA
designed UNCLE KEN turns the sausages pedantically Next to
him AUNT SUZY watches the kids with barely-contained
suspicion Both look buttoned down respectable

Someone WHISTLES The crowd parts and Victoria appears a
bottle of tequila in hand Jake in tow

VICTORIA
(whispers to Jake)
Just play along okay

Jake looks confused Aunt Suzy and Uncle Ken glare at
Victoria One of the sausages catches fire

VICTORIA (CONTD)
Hey Aunt Suzy

She kisses her aunt on the cheek deliberately leaving a
smear of lipstick

UNCLE KEN
Cover yourself up You want people
to think you’re a criminal

VICTORIA
This is my fiance Jake — he’s one
of the best tattooists in the
world

Jake stares at Victoria astonished

A hand appears gripping his arm Jake turns to see Luke
ashen faced hollow-eyed and desperate His long sleeved
shirt is well buttoned in contrast to the casual gear of his
friends

UNCLE KEN
Your cousin got sense He know he’d
be dead if he come home with one of
those things

Luke pulls Jake aside
JAKE
What’s up man Enjoying your

birthday present —

LUKE
I want to get rid of it

( ) 56

A SHOUT as a posse of Luke’s friends closes in Jake steps
back as they grab Luke and hoist him up

LUKE (CONTD)
Hey no NO

Ignoring his shouts they carry Luke to the pool and throw
him in fully-clothed Partygoers laugh and cheer Uncle Ken
shakes his head disapprovingly and returns to his sausages

Luke surfaces spluttering Someone splashes him and he
laughs reluctantly

Victoria appears at Jake’s side laughing

VICTORIA
Did you see their faces

Jake watches her unimpressed
VICTORIA (CONTD)
Don’t tell me you’ve never done

something just to piss your folks
off

EXT SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT 58

In the crowded water Luke stops moving He looks around
afraid He jerks suddenly as if hit from below And again

Luke tries to reach the edge of the pool — BANG He’s pulled
back into the water His friends splash and laugh around him
oblivious to his panic

Again Luke is hit from below He goes under and resurfaces
struggling The water blooms with black ink

A girl looks down noticing the ink She sees Luke thrashing
and backs away Others do the same scrambling for the edges

Jake meets her gaze — the answer is obvious Victoria nods

VICTORIA (CONTD)
Then maybe you should go tell her

OFFSCREEN a girl SCREAMS Victoria looks back in the
direction of the sound

VICTORIA (CONTD)
I gotta go

She turns and heads back up the path towards the house Jake
gets into his car and slams the door

EXT SUBURBAN HOUSE — NIGHT 60
The water is now completely black Luke stands alone in the
middle of the pool CHONK With a jerk he’s pulled under
The kids begin to SCREAM

UNCLE KEN

Uncle Ken jumps into the water He dives and surfaces
searching streaked with black ink

Aunt Suzy screams and runs to the edge Victoria with her

Uncle Ken lifts Luke out of the water Luke gasps his eyes
wide choking clawing

LUKE
He’s here

Luke is jerked from his father’s grasp once again and
disappears back under

Uncle Ken searches frantically as Aunt Suzy continues to
scream The other kids watch ashen-faced Ken stops moving
scanning the water as it settles to a glassy black sheet

Luke’s body breaks the surface face down Uncle Ken grabs
him and hauls him to the edge Two TEENAGERS pull him out and
lower him onto the concrete Luke’s head lolls his eyes
lifeless and glazed Blood and ink stream from his slack jaw

Luke’s mother falls across her son’s body wailing Victoria
runs up to comfort her

INT JAKE’S CAR - NIGHT 61
Jake drives intent gripping the wheel Outside the
Auckland streets are a blur We move in towards the bandage
on his hand

The surface of the bandage bulges darkens seeping black
ink The ink wells runs down across the smooth arc of the

steering wheel

Black ink drips from the steering wheel onto Jake’s lap He
frowns looks down

In the shifting glow of passing streetlights Jake’s hands
appear to be covered with intricate Samoan tatau

Jake GASPS the car swerves a HORN blares Jake
regains control He looks down at his hands now unmarked
EXT SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT 62

Aunt Suzy SHRIEKS suddenly and pulls away from Luke’s body
horrified —

Victoria follows her gaze gasps in horror —
Under Luke’s wet shirt vivid lines of black spider across

his chest Samoan tatau We move in towards the ragged lines
and shapes

INT JAKE’S BATHROOM - NIGHT 63

The sound of running water Jake winces as he peels off the
bandage Blood and ink patter into the basin from his
suppurating wound

He stares at his hollow-eyed reflection in the mirror then
looks down

For a moment the inky water leaves spidery geometric lines
of black on the white porcelain — the pattern of the pe’a —
before it’s washed away Jake frowns did I just see that

INT JAKE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 64

Jake falls back onto the bed the hibiscus flower in his
hand

Streetlights parade across the ceiling merging and shifting
forming geometric shapes of light and shadow

Jake closes his eyes The horns booming subwoofers and hum

of the street give way to the TIC-TIC-TIC-TIC of the boiler
the TAP-TAP-TAP of tatau

FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN

EXT MR VAA’S HOUSE - DAY 65

Jake approaches the house past dozens of cars parked
outside Music emanates from the garden Hearing the music
Jake hesitates Then he heads up the side of the house

EXT GARDEN - DAY 66

THUNK The blade of a machete misses a log of wood and is
embedded in the ground Peni pulls the machete free and lines
up the wood again

Jake stands at the corner of the house mouth open eyes
wide

The back yard is filled with people Hip-hoppers clean-cut
young churchgoers middle-aged couples in lava-lavas and old
people under sun umbrellas The focal point is a pig ona
spit a fire under its sizzling belly

( )

66

Towards the fence Mr Va’a sits under a sun umbrella
surrounded by other members of the community Beneath his
lava-lava his legs display dense lines of tatau

A YOUNG BOY approaches him hands him a drink Mr Va’a beams
in thanks ruffles the kid’s hair The boy smiles as though
he’s just been blessed

Jake notices Sina standing nearby He starts towards her —

Three young Samoan guys block his path — JOE CHARLIE and
DAMON Joe glares down at Jake

JOE
You lost bro

JAKE
I’m here to see Sina

JOE
Don’t think so

Sina appears beside them She puts a restraining hand on
Joe’s arm

SINA
Joe don’t be a dick

Joe holds Jake’s gaze for a moment then nods The cousins
head back to their beers Sina glares at Jake hostile
then softens

SINA (CONTD)
So which part of ‘don’t come back’
didn’t you get

JAKE
Sina listen to me

Jake glances towards the cousins uncomfortable They’re
still keeping an eye on him He takes Sina aside

JAKE (CONTD)
You asked what happened to me I
wanna tell you
Jake looks down at his scar remembering
JAKE (CONTD)

There are things I’ve never told
anyone

( ) 66

SINA
Things you’ve done

JAKE
Things that were done to me

He meets her eyes

A CHEER from the assembled crowd Semo and Opeta the two
young men we’ve seen being tattooed by Alipati are helped to
their feet by their friends They both have newly-completed
pe’a

Their short lava-lava reveal the incredible extent of their
finished pe’a from the knees to the middle of the back
beautiful patterns follow the contours of their bodies

SINA
You get the pe’a with a friend
It’s like by sharing your pain
you halve it

JAKE
What if you don’t finish

SINA
Then you bring shame on yourself
and your family

Alipati breaks an egg over Semo’s head and sprinkles coconut
water over him

ALIPATI
Faalele lau pea

Semo grins looks skyward and roars a SAMOAN WARRIOR’S
CHALLENGE Opeta grins and hugs him The onlookers clap and
cheer shaking his hand handing him gifts — food envelopes
traditional Samoan mats

SINA
Now they’re men

Mr Va’a shakes Semo’s hand gripping his arm with the other
His gaze is powerful its warmth intense

MR VA‘A
(to Semo in Samoan)
I’m proud of you boy

SEMO

(in Samoan)
Thank you Mr Va’a

( ) 66

Vaa heads back towards his chair He pauses greets Alipati
As Jake watches Va’a congratulates Alipati warmly Alipati
seems touched by his gesture deferential Sina follows his

gaze —

SINA
My uncle was a tufuga back in the
day Ali was his apprentice

JAKE
Why did he stop

SINA
Alipati was ready and the
community needed him more
(beat)
You should really pay your
respects It’s his house

Jake eyes Mr Va’‘a

Across the garden Peni chops at the pig with the machete As
Mr Va’a passes him he grabs the machete from Peni and shows
him how it’s done HACK HACK-HACK Mr Va’a carves into the
pig with three brutal chops

JAKE
I might wait till he puts down the
big pointy thing

SINA
You got a skull on your shoulder I
think you can come say hi to an old
man in a skirt

Sina leads Jake across the garden

HACK

Vaa slices another hunk out of the animal’s haunch He

wields the machete like he was born with it in his hand

Alipati sees Jake coming and steps up to whisper in Mr Va’a’s

ear

Va’a nods hands the machete back to Peni

SINA (CONTD)
Uncle this is Jake Sawyer Jake
this is Mr Va’a

Jake holds out his hand Mr Va‘a’s gaze travels from Jake’s
outstretched hand across the tattoos on his arms At last
Vaa smiles warmly

( ) 66
MR VA‘A
It is an honour to have you in my
house
JAKE

The honour’s mine

Mr Va’a takes Jake aside his manner that of a wise man about
to dispense wisdom

Sina watches as Mr Va’a leads Jake away Alipati steps up
beside her

ALIPATI
I see you made your choice

Sina meets his eyes His gaze is cold disapproving

MR VA‘A
Alipati tells me you’ve come to
Auckland to be a tufuga

Jake listens respectfully to Mr Va’a

MR VA‘A (CONTD)
Do you know the national motto of
Samoa Mr Sawyer

Jake shakes his head

MR VA’A (CONTD)

Faavaei le Atua Samoa ‘Samoa is
founded on God’ But Samoa was founded
long before God arrived Before that
time everyone had tatau The pe’a
for men The malu for women It gave
them nobility Pride It connected
them with their tupuaga It made them
strong Then the missionaries came to
Samoa And there was no dancing
allowed anymore No singing Samoan
songs And no tatau But we kept it
alive even though some of our people
thought they were going against God by
getting a tatau People like me
believed that you could worship God
without sacrificing your culture your
birthright It was hard But tatau is
still here and getting stronger

(beat)
And you come over here and expect
us to hand it all back to you
again

( ) 66

JAKE
I’m not a Christian Mr Va’a

MR VA‘A
Nor are you Samoan
(beat)
Sina will show you some
hospitality Eh Sina Look after
our guest until it’s time for
him to leave

She nods leads Jake away Mr Va’a watches after them
CUT TO

The sun sits low to the horizon draining the warmth from the
afternoon

Jake and Sina sit at the edge of the section and drink from
plastic cups Across the garden kids pack up deck chairs and
umbrellas

JAKE
So much of this I don’t know if
I’1l ever understand It’s like
another world Maybe Alipati’s
right not to teach me

SINA
He was wrong about one thing you
have come a long way
(beat)
What did you want to tell me

JAKE
(uncomfortable)
Can we go somewhere else

SINA
I guess youve seen my world
how about you show me where you’re
from

Peni passes Sina on his way inside He gives her the nod —
mission accomplished She nods back — owe ya one

Jake shows Sina into the dark shop Mirrors reflect their
silhouetted shapes against the passing lights of the road

SINA
What do you dream about now

JAKE
You wouldn’t want to know

SINA
(nods towards his tattoos)
I want to see them

Jake takes off his shirt Her eyes travel across his skin
She reaches out to touch an old-school tattoo on his
shoulder

JAKE
Crash gave me that in San
Francisco I was celebrating — my
first job my first paycheck
(sadly)
I felt like I could do anything

Jake closes his eyes as Sina runs her fingers across his
back

JAKE (CONTD)
Got that in Berlin I was cold
Broke I loved it

Sina laughs She reaches down running her hand across the
pale ridge of his scar

SINA
What about that

INT SAWYER ATTIC - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 69

BAM A man’s hand grabs Young Jake’s wrist wrenches the arm
around to reveal the fresh rose tattoo

FATHER (0S)
Youve brought shame on our house

The TIC-TIC-TIC of the boiler close Jake is pinned in the
dark corner

The knife blade is heated against the hot metal until it
glows

The dark shape of JAKES FATHER bends over Jake to work the
knife

Young Jake looks up in terror as a heavy gold CRUCIFIX
dangles in front of his face swinging as his father saws at
his flesh

FATHER (0S) (CONTD)
Pray with me boy Pray with me
‘Our father who art in heaven ’
Father steps back holding up the ragged dripping strip of
Young Jake’s flesh SCREECH He pulls open the iron door of
the boiler —

Young Jake’s eyes widen —

As his Father casts the tattoo into the boiler and SLAMS the
door closed TIC-TIC-TIC-TIC

INSIDE the raging glow consumes Jake’s flesh as the ticking
of the boiler continues around us

Won’t they be angry if you get a
palagi tattoo

An expanse of Sina’s golden skin seems to glow in the dim
light Jake runs his hands across her back tracing the
contours of her body judging the right place for the perfect
design

And we see the completed tattoo on Sina’s back A RED

work yet undeniably influenced by everything he has seen and
learned The graphic image dissolves to

THE HIBISCUS FLOWER from before now wilted and lifeless in
its glass beside Jake’s bed

INT BEDLAM OFFICE - NIGHT 80

— as Jake and Sina lie back entangled their breathing
slowing calm returning as the chaotic sounds ebb

SINA
Why did you tattoo those people if
you didn’t share their beliefs For
the money

JAKE
Because they’re pathetic
they’re weak

SINA
It’s not weak to have faith

JAKE
It is when you hide behind it
use it to hurt people

SINA
Did you ever think maybe your
father was scared And maybe now
he’s somewhere where he doesn’t
have to be anymore

Silence then

JAKE
He lives in Wisconsin in the house
I grew up in I haven’t spoken to
him in ten years

My parents are dead I can’t ever
make that pain go away But it’s
not too late for you

remains of a light bulb He looks up — the bulb has been
crushed in its fitting

A thick breath from the darkness Jake wheels A dark shape
sits in the gloom

The figure laughs quickly breaking into a hacking wet cough
Jake crosses to the windows and reaches for the curtains

JAKE (CONTD)
Let’s get some light —

IVAN
Don’t

Jake pauses A thin shaft of daylight streams in

Ivan huddles rocking gently an inky shadow Only the whites
of his eyes catch the light He leans forward the light
catches a narrow strip of skin Ivan is so covered in pe’a
that he seems black Only tiny fragments of pale skin remain
visible

IVAN (CONTD)
The space between the points
it’s the killing space

He’s finishing what you started
(clicks his tongue)

detail on his naked old body Woven into the pe’a are the
tattoos that already covered him including Jake’s Ivan
mutters in guttural Samoan

drives my fury

Jake backs away towards the door

Ivan reaches out a blackened hand the flesh of his arm
withered and wet The ridges and patterns gleam in the light

Flay my bones my black heart

Ivan’s tattooed face leers into his blackened teeth visible
behind tattooed lips

Ivan pauses then looks towards the mirror SCREAMS —

Jake wheels catching a fleeting glimpse of a dark wiry
shape as it sweeps across the broken glass

He’s coming again

Ivan starts to sing under his breath in Samoan — the lilting

song from Jake’s dreams TAP-TAP-TAP The sound reverberates

around them Jake grabs Ivan’s wrists trying to snap him out
of it

He stops The sound of WATER RUNNING Jake frowns replaces
the receiver

Jake creeps tentatively through the apartment towards the
bathroom Steam billows out into the hallway Water spreads
out across the floor in a dark stain

Water puddles around his feet mixed with black ink The ink
forms the intricate filigrees of a pe’a design then
dissolves

Jake pushes the bathroom door open

Her belly is a ragged black wound Black ichor and blood

with ink

to his knees

The gurney leaves a trail of black ink across the floor Jake
follows the grisly caravan

DR FALEAUTO
What’s her name

She lurches coughs a torrent of black ink over the medical
team It streaks their hospital whites

VICTORIA

DR FALEAUTO
Have you taken any drugs Victoria
Do you have any allergies

Jake stands helpless devastated as they push the gurney
into a trauma room

INT TRAUMA ROOM —- DAY 97

A SECOND DOCTOR and more NURSES have joined those hovering
over Victoria on the table A nurse vainly tries to staunch
the black ink discharging from Victoria’s belly

Victoria’s tattoo snakes out of the wound and covers her
chest and shoulders — her own stylised classic imagery broken
down and distorted by the pe’a motif

Jake hovers stricken Victoria grabs his arm her grip
strong her fingertips leaving black smears on his skin

VICTORIA

A needle pierces flesh The skin breaks apart discharging a
thin sheet of ink that washes down Victoria’s tattooed arm
onto the bed

WHUMP The lights spark above Victoria The room flickers in
and out of darkness

Amid the frantic medical staff is another shape glimpsed
between light and shadow —

THE TATTOOIST crouched over Victoria his back to Jake A
broken infected-looking pe’a twists up the Tattooist’s back
In one hand he grasps a bloody bone chisel in the other a
hammer

TAP-TAP-CLANG The Tattooist’s hammer falls spraying ink

JAKE
There Can’t you see him

The doctors continue work on Victoria oblivious to the
spectre upon her

WHUMP The lights flicker on again and the Tattooist is
gone Victoria is lifted off the bed by the defibrillator
her back arched

SECOND DOCTOR
Charge two-ten
(indicates Jake)
Get him out of here

A nurse SCREAMS CLANG CLANG-CLANG In three violent jolts

with brutal accuracy The medical team freezes for a moment
stunned Dr Faleauto looks at Jake

The Doctor positions the paddles pushes them down — SPLUCK
His hands break through Victoria’s chest disappearing INTO
the cavity Tattooed ribs point up around the Doctor’s wrists
as black liquid wells around them

The Doctor yelps and wrenches his hands free leaving the
paddles immersed in her chest wires trailing He staggers
away mewling horrified

Victoria breaks down as the tatau consumes her before their
eyes Her flesh sloughs away to reveal organs black with
pe’a themselves losing cohesion and dissolving into ink

Two nurses are screaming now They cower at the end of the
room

Jake watches in horror as Victoria bangs and thrashes on the
table as black ink sprays from her mouth Her flesh collapses
into itself as her torso falls away Ink drips off the bed
onto the floor

Dr Faleauto steps back as the other medics panic around him

backing away

A SECURITY GUARD blocks the way Jake wheels ducks down a
passage The doctor follows

Round a corner down a passage A stairwell — Jake takes them

three at a time Jake runs down a long corridor and rounds a
corner He looks back — he’s lost his pursuers

98

He leans against the wall panting The full horror hits him
hard and he loses it shaking His breath catches in his
throat he bites down on his knuckles

FOOTSTEPS and Dr Faleauto rounds the corner Snapping out of
it Jake runs He follows the passage down around another
corner past a closed fire escape —

A dead end Jake spins heads back towards the fire escape
Doctor Faleauto steps up to challenge him

JAKE

Do you believe in spirits

The doctor stares at him stunned

DR FALEAUTO
You think a spirit did this

JAKE
There’s another one a girl in
Otara You have to let me go

The doctor narrows his eyes considering this

JAKE (CONTD)
I have to get to her find a way to
stop this or she’ll die

Then he steps aside Jake pushes open the door As he steps
through Dr Faleauto puts a hand on Jake’s arm

DR FALEAUTO

bring it back here This isn’t
something doctors can cure

She shakes her head devastated lost

SINA
Uncle I don’t hate you

VAA
You know I should turn my back on
you How will they forgive this

He is crying now

SINA
What am I supposed to do

Vaa takes the silver crucifix from around his neck His hand
shakes as he holds it out to her

VAA
Same as the rest of us — pray to
God that he will show you the way

Sina stares at the cross undecided

VAA (CONTD)
It’s the only way

Sina’s trembling hand closes around the crucifix

104 INT ALIPATI’S GARAGE - NIGHT 104

Jake sits on the couch his head in his hands Alipati paces
muttering He looks down at Jake and shakes his head

ALIPATI
I’ve worked for years to make
people see tatau for what it is
Pride Honour A birthright for all
Samoans But there’s always people
like you come along and think they
can take without asking —

JAKE
I did ask

ALIPATI
And I said no

( )

JAKE
If I can find out what this spirit
wants maybe I can —

down

JAKE
I’ve seen how they die

INT CHURCH - NIGHT 105

Sina sits hunched in the front row of the church Around her
the sound of singing from the assembled congregation Sina’s
mouth moves in muttered prayer

Beyond the hymn an undercurrent of TAPPING Sina’s prayer
falters

JAKE (VO)
First the sounds the visions
the tattoo it grows Then the ink
from everywhere like blood
A cough wracks Sina and she doubles over her hand going to
her mouth As the spasm subsides she looks down in horror
to see flecks of black ink on her hand

JAKE (VO) (CONT’D)
Shell scream and beg for the end

around them

straight ahead as they drive

Cringing deafened Jake looks around anxiously as the bass
reaches earth-shattering proportions Lights seem to fly past
the window Jake grips the door his knuckles white

Osone’s eyes dart under his eyelids A thin line of blood
trickles from one of his nostrils

Suddenly the pounding bass is obliterated as a burst of
STATIC rips through the car a deafening pulse of white noise
that oscillates with an undercurrent of angry whispering

The cousin driving the car brakes hard

EXT AUCKLAND MOTORWAY - NIGHT 110

The car slams into a sharp skid sliding sideways onto the
hard shoulder and coming to a stop A car behind swerves
around it laying on the horn

INT OSONE’S COUSINS’ CAR - NIGHT 111
The roar of whispers is deafening Jake blocks his ears

Osone convulses Spots of blood flick from his nose and ears
splattering the plastic covering the car’s interior
Terrified Jake tries to hold him

JAKE
What’s happening

The cousins watch impassively from the front seat as Osone
convulses His hand whips out and grabs Jake’s arm vice-
like

His voice booms — an adult voice Multiple lines of song
overlap in a distorted hair-raising cacophony

INT CHURCH - NIGHT 112

The Minister stands before the congregation The churchgoers
are on their feet united in song Their voices soar toward
the heavens

At the front of the congregation Sina sits with her head
bowed over Vaa’s silver crucifix necklace Her eyes are
closed as her lips move in prayer A HAND on her shoulder
mr Va’a standing next to her singing loudly

BANG The church doors swing open framing Jake

At the pulpit the Minister stops in mid-song Churchgoers
follow his gaze including Mr Va’a Sina looks up dazed with
shock and fear

The song peters out as Jake strides down the aisle By the
time he reaches the front a blanket of shocked silence has
descended All eyes are on Jake

Mr Va’a steps into the aisle a hand on Sina’s shoulder

MR VAA
You are not welcome in this house

JAKE
Please tufuga

Mr Va’a is taken aback at Jake’s deference

( )

112 112

JAKE (CONTD)
An angry spirit is using me to
kill If I can learn who he is I
might be able to stop him

The churchgoers mutter to each other — what’s he talking

about
MR VA‘A
Don’t bring your palagi nonsense in
here
JAKE

Sina show them

MR VA‘A
She doesn’t need your help

Sina looks up at him the crucifix clutched in her hand She
doesn’t look so sure

MR VA’A (CONTD)
(to Sina)
You tell him you place yourself in
God’s hands tonight

She gets to her feet

MR VA’A (CONTD)
Sina

JAKE
Sina please trust me

Mr Va’a steps close to Jake and Sina his voice lowered
heavy with shame The community listens with bated breath

MR VA‘A
You have damned her body boy —
will you take her soul as well
JAKE
Sina God can’t stop this but I
can

Sina looks between them making up her mind

SINA
Uncle I’m sorry

MR VA‘A
You are not my Aiga

( ) 112

She meets Va’a’s gaze devastated then steps past him
into the aisle

JAKE
Show them

She raises her top revealing her tattoo to the congregation

In the congregation a WOMAN in her late 20s stands with her
HUSBAND Her eyes widen with recognition her hand goes to
her mouth She looks around for support

Mr Va’a’s expression roils with barely contained fury His
fists clench tight and release clench and release

JAKE (CONT’D)

(to the congregation)
The spirit who did this will
continue until she’s dead or
until his shame is ended

MR VAA
(to the congregation)
No this is our business

Up the back the woman’s husband places his hand on her arm

HUSBAND
(sotto)
Let Mr Va’a deal with this

JAKE
(to Va’a)
You turn your backs on people
you’re ashamed of But if you turn
your back on her it’s you who
should be ashamed

SINA
Uncle please let them speak

MR VA‘A
(roars)
I said LEAVE

Mr Va’a faces the Minister He starts to sing loudly
confidently Around Jake and Sina the congregation joins in
uncertain at first until the church is once again filled
with song

Sina takes Jake’s hand and begins to drag him down the aisle
towards the door

( ) 112

JAKE
YOU CAN’T JUST LET HER DIE

The woman in the congregation watches Jake and Sina pass She
looks around catches the eye of some of the others They nod
encouragement — go on

EXT CHURCH - NIGHT 113

Jake bursts through the church doors supporting Sina As
they stumble away from the church Sina staggers and goes
down on her knees retching ink Jake kneels to cradle her
desperate

SINA
(disoriented)

I can see him
The church door opens behind them Jake looks up —
The woman from the congregation standing at the top of the
steps She looks desperately down at them as though about to
speak Her husband appears behind her and grabs her arm
roughly She looks up at him and he shakes his head — no

Jake remembers —

SINA
(weakly)
I’m scared

JAKE
Lock the doors

Jake climbs out of the car Sina locks the doors behind him
A rough neighbourhood by day it’s scarier by night Music
booms from a house further up the street Dogs bark A few
doors up NEIGHBOURS sit on the front lawn

Jake walks up to the edge of Perenese’s property and peers
around the neighbours’ fence The house is dark He scurries
up the side of the house

Around the back Jake tries the back door It opens

INT PERENESE HOUSE — NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 119

Jake creeps inside through the kitchen and into the hallway
Dim light filters in from the street

Jake pushes open the bedroom door The photographs of the
four young women on the shelf above the bed smile at him in
the darkness

Jake scans the room then turns to the mirror A white cloth
hangs over it Jake pulls it away to reveal his own
reflection He stares into the dark glass

JAKE
Where are you

Jake heads down the hallway deeper into the house He pushes
open a door — a bathroom The next door is locked

Jake stands back considering then POW He kicks the
door The wood cracks and the door bangs open The air around
Jake seems to rush into the room as if into a vacuum

INT PERENESE HOUSE BEDROOM — NIGHT 120

Jake crosses to the window and yanks opens the curtains
Street light washes in illuminating —

A boy’s room with a teenage lifetime’s accumulation — a
rugby ball toys books and cassettes — all neatly arranged
on the shelves and dresser awaiting their owner’s return

Photos adorn the walls A school portrait a league team a
smiling teenager holding up a fish in one in another wearing
a suit with a teenage girl on his arm

And a final photo Jake lifts it from the wall The Perenese
family in front of the newly built church — Perenese his
wife four daughters and his SON standing at the edge of the
frame It’s the same photo Sina found torn in the box of
photos but this one is complete

The young man in the photos is THE TATTOOIST

THUD From elsewhere in the house Jake freezes

INT JAKE’S CAR - NIGHT 121

reflective glass of the windows

INT PERENESE HOUSE BEDROOM — NIGHT 122
Voices the sound of the front door closing Frantically
Jake looks around for a weapon

INT PERENESE HOUSE — NIGHT 123

Mr Perenese steps out of the light of the living room into
the dark hallway He calls over his shoulder

PERENESE
(in Samoan)
I don’t want to eat I’m not
hungry

( )

The old man stops in his tracks Jake stands in the open
doorway of the boy’s room a Samoan cricket bat in one hand
the photo still held in the other

Perenese stares Jake down with the eyes of a man who has
faced the worst life can deal him

JAKE
What did you do to him
PERENESE
I don’t know what you’re talking
about
JAKE
Your son
PERENESE

We don’t speak of him he
brought shame on this house

Mrs Perenese appears in the living room doorway At the sight

of Jake

she GASPS

PERENESE (CONTD)
Call the police

JAKE
What did he do Speak up to you in
public Skip church What

Perenese seems taken aback by Jake’s fury

PERENESE
He was a pe’a-mutu He did not
finish his pe’a You happy now

JAKE
And you killed him you son of a
bitch You were so afraid of what
people would think —

PERENESE
No

Tears well in Perenese’s eyes his shoulders bowed with the

shame

JAKE
If you really cared about him
you’d’ve let him choose whether or
not he got a pe’a

( ) 123

PERENESE
More than anything he wanted to be
aman I say he is too young But
he ask me he beg me to get the
pe’a

JAKE
If he wanted it so bad then why
the hell didn’t he finish Huh

PERENESE
I don’t know Before he get the
pe’a I pass on to him the ulalei
given to me my father to give him
the strength it gave to my family
He take it from me I never see it
or him again

JAKE
I’ve seen him

PERENESE
(hopeful )
Lomi Where is he

JAKE
I was hoping you could tell me

PERENESE
Please I don’t understand

His confusion is genuine Jake looks away thinking hard

He said he go to the tufuga for
the pe’a But the tufuga never saw
him on that day

know who killed him

Jake starts the car

INT MR VA’A’S HOUSE - NIGHT 125

A vintage stylus rides a wave of warped vinyl as an old
record spins The music is the eerie Samoan song from the
dream of the Tattooist punctuated by the muffled crackle of
needle on scratched 45

Mr Va’a’s church jacket hangs over the back of his chair
Beyond Mr Vaa carries a white lace cloth and drapes it over
the mirror in his living room
BANGING on the front door His eyes narrow warily
Vaa opens the door and relaxes
MR VA‘A
(in Samoan)
Alipati it’s late
Alipati fingers something in his hand Va’a looks down
The bone and wood tattooing tool is in his hands
Vaa looks back up wary once again
ALIPATI
(in Samoan)
When you handed down your tools
what else did you pass to me
MR VA‘A

(in Samoan)
Come in

EXT MR VA‘A’S HOUSE - NIGHT 126

Jake’s car pulls up outside Va’a’s house Jake opens the door
for Sina and helps her up the side of the house She moans in
pain stumbles

SINA
You can’t accuse my uncle of
murder you need proof

JAKE

Well find it We just gotta know
where to look

SINA
He used to work in his shed
Locked ever since

The faintest TAP-TAP-TAP a ghostly memory
JAKE
(to himself)
Right in front of my eyes
Light spills out of the living room window onto the pathway
ahead The curtains are open Jake risks a peep over the
windowsill and gapes in surprise
INT LIVING ROOM — NIGHT 127
Inside Alipati paces nervously as he speaks to Va’a in even
tones He indicates the tattooing tool that sits on the
dining table Va’a glares at him eyes blazing

EXT MR VA‘A’S HOUSE - NIGHT 128

Sina retches Jake cringes and pulls her against him to
muffle the sound as droplets of ink patter onto his chest

A shadow falls across the pathway ahead Above them Mr Va‘a
looms at the window He stands sentinel for what seems like
an eternity Below Jake doesn’t dare to breathe

INT LIVING ROOM — NIGHT 129

Mr Va’a stares out of the window His own reflection on the
glass comes into focus He yanks the curtains closed

EXT GARDEN — NIGHT 130

Jake breathes a sigh of relief Keeping low to the ground he
and Sina stumble towards the shed

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 131
Mr Va’a turns from the window to where Alipati paces

ALIPATI
(in Samoan)
It’s always bad luck for them to
get the pe’a alone

Alipati turns his back head down as he gathers his thoughts
Immediately Va’a moves — lightning quick for a man of his
size He lifts a small table from beside his easy chair and
smashes Alipati on the head Alipati crumples

The song ends as the needle runs into the groove at the end
of the 45 lifts and returns to the beginning The
song starts again

INT SHED — NIGHT 132

The door scrapes open sweeping a shaft of moonlight across
old flax mats and dirt floor a rake and shovel A dirty
mirror leans against one wall

Jake lies Sina against the wall and kneels beside her She is
fading fast The tattoo is spreading up her neck now towards
her face

He stands looks around On the wall a familiar tapa cloth
faded with age but recognisable Jake kneels examines the
flax mats stained in patches

JAKE
I’ve dreamed this place

He pulls up the flax mats The dirt beneath is packed hard
but uneven He grabs the shovel

CLANG Jake brings the shovel down on the hard earth
dislodging a chunk of it CLANG-CLANG He hacks again
churning up the ground to reveal —

A dull pale section of skull Teeth protrude from its
jawbone

( )

132

SINA
Why

Jake crouches and puts his arms around her

JAKE
It’s finished now — that’s all that
matters Lomi’s got nothing to be
ashamed of

Sina nestles her head against him and closes her eyes

Jake looks up to the dirty mirror against the wall A
glimpse of a dark shape standing over them —

CLANG Sina’s eyes flick open in shock A massive spasm
wracks her body More lines of pe’a appear snaking up her
neck

Alarmed Jake turns back to Lomi’s remains

JAKE (CONTD)
We know you didn’t run What more
do you want

He stares in anguish at the bones and sees something else
in the dirt He scrabbles frantically with his hands
unearthing a necklace of long whale teeth a traditional
Samoan ulalei The one from the image in Mr Perenese’s house

JAKE (CONTD)
It’s not about his shame The
shame is on his family

The BANG of a door from outside Jake spins terrified He
looks out of the shed to see —

EXT GARDEN - NIGHT 133

Head down Mr Va’a drags Alipati across the garden by his
hair

JAKE
You’re gonna need a bigger shed

Vaa drops Alipati and glares at Jake Before Jake can act
Vaa steps to the edge of the shed and lifts the machete from
where it leans

With surprising agility Mr Va’a lunges The machete whooshes
through the air glances off the iron wall as Jake sidesteps
He tackles Va’a shoving him out into the garden

INT SHED - NIGHT 134

The Tattooist emerges from the shadows at the end of the
shed his eyes fixed on Sina

backhanded cracking Jake over the head Jake reels and falls
on the grass

Vaa stands over him swings the machete Jake reaches for a
piece of firewood swings it up like a shield the machete
whistles down — CHOCK The blade sticks in the wood Va‘a

rips the wood from Jake’s hands and shakes it from the blade

He swings again Jake rolls — THUNK The blade sinks deep
into the ground Mr Va’a leans down to grasp the machete with
both hands

Jake scrambles away and races towards the house

INT KITCHEN LIVING ROOM — NIGHT 136

Jake slams the kitchen door shut He locks it - SMASH The
machete smashes through the glass Mr Va’a reaches inside
clawing for the lock

Jake scrambles into the living room looking for

The phone He snatches up the receiver reaches for the
buttons as — SMASH The machete cleaves the plastic in two

Jake jumps clear picks up one of the dining chairs — SMASH
A blow from the machete shatters it leaving Jake with a
piece of wood

MR VA’‘’A
Didn’t anyone ever tell you not to
fuck with an islander with a
machete

Mr Va’a swings — THUNK The blade lodges in the dining table
Jake grabs Mr Va’a in a rugby tackle slamming him against
the wall

VVVVVVIP The needle scrapes off the 45 as the record player
crashes to the floor

Alipati stirs He picks himself up groaning Blood runs down
the side of his face He shakes his head and gets unsteadily
to his feet

to the excavated grave

MR VA‘A
Like you they would not have
understood

Vaa shoves Jake back across the room He advances wrenching
the machete from the table

JAKE
So you killed him and said he ran
away — you brought shame on the
Pereneses instead of on yourself

INT SHED - NIGHT 142
Lomi gasps in agony on the flax mats The dark shadow of Mr
Vaa stands over him the machete raised The blade falls —
CHOCK

INT LIVING ROOM — NIGHT 143

Jake presses up against the wall as Va’a approaches
menacing

MR VA‘A
He got sick because his spirit was
weak It was a mercy to kill him

JAKE
What about Sina and Alipati
Victoria Luke their blood’s on

your hands too It’s you who should
be ashamed

MR VAA
I would rather DIE than live in
shame

Vaa throws Jake back into the sideboard grabs him by the
throat with a meaty fist and raises the machete He swings —

THUNK The blade is buried in the wall
As Mr Va’a wrenches the machete free Jake scans the room for

a weapon His eyes alight on the tool on the table Alipati
brought with him Jake grabs the tool and runs for the door

EXT PERENESE HOUSE - NIGHT 144

From inside the sound of approaching footsteps The door

Alipati holds something out to Mr Perenese He looks down at
it his eyes filling with tears The whalebone necklace
Lomi’s ulalei

EXT GARDEN - NIGHT 145

INT SHED - NIGHT 146

Jake bursts into the shed and looks around wildly Signs of a
struggle patches of black ink splatters and a trail
leading to a dark corner Jake steps closer Sina huddles
there her breath ragged and erratic

JAKE
Sina

CLANG Jake turns towards the sound the mirror A glimpse of
the Tattooist straddling her his tools falling with
cataclysmic force She flinches with the might of each blow

JAKE (CONTD)
(roars)
LEAVE HER ALONE

VAA (0S)
Let her go boy It is a mercy

Jake spins to see Va’a standing in the doorway the machete
in his hand He is covered in blood dirt and sweat He looks
like he’s at the end of the line

JAKE
Never

Vaa nods like he expected this He hefts the machete

( )

146

VAA
Then get used to this place You’re
gonna be here for a long time

Vaa raises the machete lunges as —

Jake steps aside and plunges the tattooing tool into Va’a’s
neck

Mr Va’a ROARS in pain and stumbles back He wrenches the tool
from his neck It squirts blood then a plume of black ink
that slows to a trickle Mr Va’a looks blankly at Jake
then sneers

MR VA‘A
I wear the pe’a boy One little
prick ain’t gonna hurt me

JAKE
Wait’ll you see what this little
prick can do

Vaa scoffs then looks past Jake to the shadows

Glaring from between light and dark is THE TATOOIST the fury
that has kept him from peace burning in his eyes Va’a’s face
goes slack with terror He looks to the tool in his hand
then to Jake realising what Jake’s done

Wind sighs through the walls under the roof The strumming
of the guitar the lilting song

Vaa backs away stumbles into Lomi’s grave and falls He
whimpers in fear

Jake gathers Sina in his arms

CLANG Mr Va’a jolts Blood blooms on his T-shirt Va’a rips
off his T-shirt to expose his torso — streaked with blood A
fresh line of tatau extends from his pe’a

Va’a looks to Jake in absolute horror In the mirror another
horrifying glimpse of the tattooist standing over Va’a
hammering brutally

Vaa moans in panic thrashes in pain Then he freezes as he
looks past Jake to where Mr Perenese stands in the
doorway Alipati behind him Perenese holds the ulalei in
shaking hands

Jake looks to the mirror — the Tattooist looks up from Va’a

his eyes burning with rage Held aloft ready for another
blow his tools drip ink and blood

( ) 146

Seeing the grave Mr Perenese approaches slowly Tears run
down his cheeks Jake watches moved by the old man’s
emotion

Vaa begins to crawl weakly away into the shadows

Perenese goes down on one knee at the edge of the grave He
looks up at Jake mournfully

PERENESE
For my shame I’m sorry If I was
hard on him it was only because I
loved him so much my son

JAKE
I understand that now

Mr Perenese holds out the ulalei In the mirror a flicker of
The Tattooist crouching in the grave The ulalei falls
through the apparition to grace Lomi’s bones once more The
wind seems to sigh through the structure of the shed as
though relieving it of some great burden then silence

A thick COUGHING from the corner Va’a Mr Perenese turns
strides over stands over Mr Va’a

Slowly emphatically Mr Perenese unbuttons his shirt to
revealing his spectacular pe’a Then he bends picks up the
machete Va’a cowers as Mr Perenese raises the weapon his
eyes burning with rage —

JAKE (CONTD)
Wait

Perenese turns aghast at Jake’s intervention

PERENESE
You know nothing of this

JAKE
He needs to pay for what he did

PERENESE
(nods )
As he must — with his life
JAKE
He said he’d rather die than live
in shame

Perenese thinks about his his eyes never leaving Va’a

( ) 146

PERENESE
There’1l be no mercy for him

At last Perenese allows the point of the machete to rest in
the dirt Alipati stands beside him looking down at Mr Va’a
in disgust

ALIPATI
There’s another price he can pay

MR VA‘A
(humble)
What do you ask of me tufuga
Mr Perenese holds the machete out to Va’a — take it Va‘a’s
eyes widen in fear realising what it is that Perenese wants
He grasps the machete with a trembling hand

Jake’s eyes widen in horror as OFFSCREEN Va’a gives a thick
ugly MOAN Jake turns away

He crosses to Sina and lifts her in his arms As the sounds
of Va’a’s penance continue he steps out of the shed and
disappears into the darkness

FADE TO BLACK

The sound of SAMOAN VOICES united in song - a FUNERAL HYMN

EXTINT CEMETERYPERENESE HOUSEJAKE’S APARTMENT - DAY 147
The song continues over a series of INTERCUT IMAGES
The sun breaks through the clouds above —

The CHURCH CEMETERY A large crowd of MOURNERS stands around
an unseen grave SINGING in unison

THE PERENESE HOUSE — cars vans utes pull up outside Mrs
Perenese steps out onto the front doorstep confused then
breaks into a tearful smile

JAKE’S HAND caresses Sina’s back the tattoo he gave her the
chaotic marks of Lomi’s pe’a now healed into rigid scars

ON THE PERENESE PATHWAY members of the community make their

way towards the house their expressions conciliatory One by
one they hug Mrs Perenese

JAKES NEEDLE BUZZES joining the broken lines of tatau
adding colour definition beauty Sina lies face down Jake
leans to whisper

JAKE
Does it hurt

SINA
(shakes her head smiles)
Not anymore

THE GRAFFITI on the fence is painted around coloured
incorporated into a Pacific mural beautified The broken
window pane is replaced

JAKE TATTOOS across Sina’s belly — an image wholly original
now — beautiful vibrant a tattoo of life

IN THE GARDEN kids play while others rally around the
Pereneses Mrs Perenese sits in a garden chair her dress
brightly coloured her smile wide

THE CEMETERY where the mourners make their way towards the
church

THE TATTOO completed Sina smiles up at Jake He puts his
arms around her kisses her the images of their tattoos
seeming to merge into a whole

Fading in the sound of a RINGING TONE

INT JAKE’S BEDROOM —- DAY 148
Jake sits on the edge of his bed the phone to his ear
waiting as the phone on the other end continues to ring
Finally a click as the connection is made
FATHER (VO)
(on phone)
Hello

JAKE
Hey Dad it’s me

Tears in his eyes Jake smiles as we

EXT MR VAA’S HOUSE - DAY 149

A grey South Auckland day A van pulls up HOMECARE written
on the side A middle-aged white woman steps out — a HOMECARE
VOLUNTEER She takes a plastic covered tray from the back of
the van and heads towards —

Mr Va’a’s house now fallen into disrepair The garden is
wild and overgrown Where the shed once was there is a naked
pit containing rubbish and garden waste

The Volunteer heads up the driveway towards the back door

INT MR VA’A’S HOUSE —- DAY 150

Moving slowly through the house The silence is oppressive
The sound of a key in the lock then the Volunteer lets
herself in

VOLUNTEER
(calls cheerily)
Mr Va’a Homecare

No response She steps tentatively inside and creeps down the
hallway

The further into the house she steps the more creeped out
the volunteer looks Curtains are drawn Objects clothes
empty plates lie strewn Flies buzz
She steps into the LIVING ROOM looks around and GASPS —
Mr Va’a’s chair is a dark shape at the end of the room
Rattled the Volunteer approaches slowly
VOLUNTEER (CONTD)

Mr Va’a my name’s Rachel I

have your lunch for you
Vaa’s fists clench and unclench on the arms of his chair A
low insane CACKLE Trying to ignore him the Volunteer busies

herself unpacking his lunch

Vaa pounds the arm of the chair in frustration We glimpse
powerful arms covered in raised scarring

MR VAA
The shame

VOLUNTEER
Now Mr Va‘a you’ll need to calm
down before you can —

She turns to him with his lunch sees him and GASPS despite
herself —

We push in to find him now

Below the chest his body is a contoured mass of scar tissue
where his pe’a has been cut from his body A jagged landscape
of pain carved and sutured pitted by the removal of deep
chunks of flesh in other places flayed and then grafted
over

MR VAA
the shame

On this ruin of a man we

FADE OUT
