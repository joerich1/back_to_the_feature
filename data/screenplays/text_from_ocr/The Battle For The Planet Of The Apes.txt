THE BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES

Working Title

First Draft Story Outline

by

PAUL DEHN

July 5 1972
We rove Modern Citys Civic Center soon after sunrise Its
otherwise deserted streets (over which we SUPER the date

2004 AD) are being prepared for some sort of festivity
by groups of early WORKERS human males in red females in

blue We watch
- Group 1 hosing down a sidewalk
- Group 2 sweeping clean behind Group 1 and passins

- Group 3 brushing adhesive “size on the back of a

poster held face downwards on a cafe tabletop

- Group 4 attaching a furled flag to the base of a

flagpole

- Group 5 scrubbing (and masking) the plinth of a stone
statue whose shoes only are visible below the hem of
a sculpted robe A loudening drum-roll as the Scrubbers
step back to reveal the plinths inscription CAESAR I

Then triurphal MUSIC crashes in over a CUT TO

The flag unfurling in the wind as it reaches the mast-head
Against a yellow ground the head of an Ape (CAESAR) rises
from syrbolically blood-red flames Over the flag as it

flutters we SUPER MAIN TITLE
BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES

and CUT TO

- Group 3 affixing the poster to the wall It bears the
Same device as the flag but the head is profiled and
subscribed HAIL CAESARI
CUT TO
- Dramatic shot of the statues head Imperial Caesar
looks down on his subjects one of whom (a human male)
is climbing up a ladder to scrub the great stone face -

from which as he scrubs we CUT TO

Caesars own face A human hand is combing his hair and beard
We PULL BACK to reveal Caesar seated in a futuristic robing-
room before a tall mirror He is attended by his red-uniformed
VALET who now ceases his ministrations and steps back to
otserve the reflected result
CAESAR
Thank you George
As Valet backs out of shot MACDONALD (Caesars Negro overseer
in CCHQUEST) moves into the mirror and stands behind the
Chirpanzee who is now his master We shall learn that he is
the only Human in Modern City permitted to wear clothes rather
than a servants uniform
MACDONALD
Your escort is ready Caesar and
the Council is assembled
Outside in a long interior corridor two armed black-uniformed

Corilla GUARDS spring to attention and salute as Caesar regally

emerges followed by Macdonald The Group moves off through
and MONTAGE of interior corridors Minor Ape Officials encountered
en route give place with that slight inclination of the head
which serves for a royal bow in England The few Human Workers
back away more obsequiously and bow lower During this we

SUPER
MAIN CREDITS

And as CREDITS END we reach great double-doors on which

Macdonald ceremonially knocks Over the doors opening CUT TO

REVERSE LONG SHOT (from inside the Council Cnamber) of doors
flung open dy huran SERVANTS

MACDONALD
Pray silence for Caesar

He gives place as Caesar enters and the Councilors rise from

either side of a long table They are

- 3 CHIMPANZEES led ty PAN who is young intellectual
and idealistic The speed of his talk reflects the
speed of his mind and his mind is all peace between

Apes and humans

3 GORILLAS led by ALDO who is early-middle-aged
aggressive militaristic hates Humans and would like

them exterminated - if necessary by war

- 2 ORANGUTANS led by ZENO who is the elderly apostle of

science and reason It takes him longer than the others

Tha entantifie name for the species Chimpanzee
4
to form a conclusion but the conclusion once reached
is always more practical than Pants and more logical

than Aldos

The Orangutans are a minority faction but their two votes in
Council can be decisive in the event of a deadlock between the
three Chimpanzees and three Gorillas We must watch Zeno

At the pictures end he will become the Lawgiver retrospectively
referred to in PLANET In the SCREENPLAY we shall more fully
establish the character and viewpoint of each faction-leader
during the brief debate that follows Caesars opening statement

Meanwhile all Councilors resume their seats for

CAESAR
Fellow Chimpanzees Gorillas and
Orangutans On this thirteenth
annjversary of the Night of the Fires
I have (as is our annual custom)
assembled and collated reports from
all territories on the state of Ape
Supreracy and I now announce with
pride that ninety percent of Mankind
is under Ape domination and control

A growl of approval as the Gorillas hairy hands slap the

tabletop Macdonald remains impassive

CAESAR
There are still isolated pockets of
human resistance in the north - but
I stress that they are isolated and
therefore constitute no serious threat
provided that they remain scattered
until we have rounded them up and
disarmed them

Macdonald just perceptibly sighs
CAESAR

(looking at him)
Disarmament of their minor weapons
continues Disarmament of their
major weapons appears complete We
shall use the former only for our
own defence - and the latter will
never be reactivated

(to Councilors)
The world may breathe again It
cannot now be destroyed by those who
walk upon it Thirteen years after
the Night of the Fires we stand upon
the brink of an Era of Peace

Only the Gorillas take no part in applause which is punctuated

by murmurs of Peace from the rest Then softly but audibly

MACDONALD
And goodwill Caesar

CAESAR
(puzzled)
Towards whom

MACDONALD
Towards Men

A pin-drop silence broken by Aldo who spits
CAESAR
You have our goodwill provided you
keep our laws
ALDO
(snorting)
ynat more do you want A seat on
our Council

MACDONALD
Yes

Another silence Then successively Aldo GORILIA 1 and
GORILLA 2 laugh and laugh
MACDONALD

(interrupting)
I have seen to it that we have served
you quietly faithfully and efficently
for more than a decade We have put
not only our energies at your disposal
Dut our knowledge God gave you brains
We have given you minds You still need
us Yet we have no representation on
your Council

ALDO
Because it is our Council

PAN
(rising)
It is not our Council but the Communitys
And I do not see why Humans who share
this Community in however humble and
subordinate a capacity should not derand
at least one seat on

ZENO
(rising)
Demand or deserve

MACDONALD
I have said that we have served you
peacefully for more than -

ZENO

(sardonic)
Ten years Can ten years of good
behavior expiate ten thousand years of
bad What use is peace in the south
while there are still rebels in the
north Come to us again when no Human
has killed either an Ape or another
Huran for one hundred years -

MACDONALD
And we have all been exterminated -

ALDO
(with relish)

Hal
MACDONALD

- because we are no longer of use to
you -
CAESAR
(gently but with
authority)
Macdonald the fact that you saved ny
life twice on the Night of the Fires does
not entitle you to address this Council
or to formulate policy You too are
a servant What sets you above your
fellows is that you are mine
(smiling)
And I hope you will remain so
BOOM The audience may jump at the sound of 08 cannon-fire
but not those inside the Council Chamber who have been expecting
it Macdonald deferential again looks at his watch

MACDONALD
Your subjects await you Caesar

As all rise we CUT TO

BOOM In the courtyard outside a cannon (operated by Gorillas)
fires a second royal salute to cheers and cries of

MASSED APFS
Hail Caesar Hail Caesar ad lib

CUT TO

The “robing room

where Caesar is being groomed and invested in
resplendently green ceremonial cloak by his VALET while the
sound of the firing and crowd-voices continues outside We

PAN OFF him to

LISA (the female Chimpanzee from CONQUEST) being similarly
robed and groomed by two human MAIDS in blue servant-costumes

As a Maid tightens Lisas beit Lisa (to both Maids consternation)

gives an involuntarily little gasp of pain but follows it
instantly with a smile of reassurance pats her own belly and

whispers something in the Maidts ear

MAID
Oh Matam Im so glad
CAESAR
Come Lisa The citizens are

waiting
They go out and emerge into

The courtvard - followed at a discreet distance by Macdonald
Here a EOQDYGUARD of six Gorillas salute and escort ther throuch

the parted Ape Crowd into

Modern Citys Civic Center Pretty much the same as it was in
Conouest except for the one stupefying change the Master-
Servant situation has been corpletely reversed Everywhere
the Apes are now the masters and mistresses Gorillas in
black Chimps in Green Orangutans in orange-brown and the

Humans (males in red females in blue) are now the slaves

At Caesars passing the Male Apes bow and the Females (sore
with difficulty) bob curtseys The Humans obsequiously give
place to him and his entourage (or are non-violently chivvied
into doing so by the Gorillas) as the tour of inspection
proceeds and reveals how weirdly the tadles have been turned

since the end of Conquest
Everywhere are yellow flags and posters of Caesars
head backed by the symbolically blood-red flames of
the Night of the Fires A triumphal banner across
the royal route proclaims HAIL CAESAR”

In a greengrocers shop window replete with fruit and
vegetables a human ARTIST is bedecking effigies of

Caesar and Lisa with fresh flowers

A PA speaker bawls Citizens of Ape City Caesar
is amongst you and commands that you show him neither
ceremony nor homage on this festal day that celebrates
thirteen years of Ape Freedom

CUT TO
Chimpanzee ANNOUNCER continuing in studio Let there

be no formalities But go your ways in peace

Gorilla POLICEMAN surreptitiously chivvving one of
half-a-dozen human SWEEPERS who have been cleaning
up the entry into

The Piazza where we INTERCUT Caesar and Lisa with
POV shots

At the outdoor cafe seated Apes are being served by
Humans with bananas oranges grapes and raisins which
they eat with attempted refinement A Chimp calls
Waiter A Gorilla (less articulate) thumps the

table and a human WAITER comes obsequiously running
10
- In a playground a group of Ape CHILDREN are sliding down
chutes sitting on see-saws and swinging on swings under
the supervision of a female Human Teacher (LINDY) At
Caesars approach
LINDY
Now what shall we play children
Follow My Leader or Blind Apes Buff
CHILDREN

(in dutiful unanimity)
Follow My Leadert

Caesar is delighted His Group descends into

- A pedestrian subway where we pass doors to three
restrooms respectively labeled Ladies Gentlemen
» « » and Humans It is from the last of these that
there emerges a human STRANGER who blocks the Groups
progress a tall lean John Carradine type with
fanatical blue eyes and an authority enhanced by his
clothes which are of the trim but travel-stained sort
that Hurans used once to wear

STRANGER

(ironic smile)
Hail Caesar

Macdonald hastily interposes himself between the Stranger and

an angry Caesar flanked by his angrier Bodyguard

MACDONALD
(quietly)
By what right are you not in servants
uniform

STRANGER
By the right of humans to dress as
they please

CAESAR
(quietly)
Humans have no rights except those
conferred on them by Apes
(to Guard-Commander)
Arrest him

As the Guard moves forward

STRANGER
Wait

The monosyllable has the stopping force of a 45 bullet

STRANGER
If you harm one hair of my head
this City will be destroyed

In the silence Lisa touches her belly whimpers and hides her

eyes Put Caesar suddenly relaxes and rolls his eyes skyward

in mock resignation

CAESAR
Another lunatic
(to the Guard Commander)
Detach two Gorillas to escort him to
General Aldots Headquarters for
interrogation Then report to me

Guard Commander clicks to obedient attention

MACDONALD
And Caesar

CAESAR
Yes Macdonald

MACDONALD
May I respectfully suggest that he be
well-treated until were sure

CAESAR
Of what Macdonald

MACDONALD
Of his lunacy
12
Caesar frowns and turns to Guard Commander
CAESAR
See to it
(to Macdonald)
Come Were wasting time

The Escort moves off in one direction the Group exits subway

in the other Emerging they pass

A Barbers Shop to which we CLOSE as Group exits shot Human
hands remove a hot towel from the face of an Ape He is

having his shoes shined by a little BLACK BOY to whom he tosses

INSERT A silver dollar-sized coin on the Boys black palm
It has Caesars profiled image and is circumscribed CAESAR 1
REX IMPERATOR SIMIORUM From the image of Caesars head

QUICK IAP DISSOLVE TO

The real Caesars profile frowning in the doorway (opened by
Macdonald) of Aldos office as we slow PULL BACK during
dialogue to include Stranger (back turned between Guards)
addressing Aldo In the corner sits a human CLERK punching a
shorthand-typewriter
STRANGER
For the last time I will speak
before no one but Caesar
CAESAR
Caesar is here

He sits as Stranger whips round into confrontation

CAESAR
What is your name
STRANGER
You took it away and gave me a number

ALDO
What number
STRANGER
(scornfully)
Do you expect me to remember it
ALDO
Where have you come from
STRANGER
The North
ALDO
What territory
Silence
MACDONALD
For your own sake please tell us
Silence
MACDONALD
Who are you
STRANGER
A messenger
CAESAR
Sent by
STRANGER
My master
CAESAR
(patiently)
Has he and name
STRANGER

We call him Nimrod
Dialogue unexpectedly continues uninterrupted over a visual

SHOCK CUT TO
14
NIMROD seated at a portable wooden table in a tattered tent
through which the north wind flaps and whines A grizzled
giant by John Wayne out of Royal Dano he wears the battered
cap of a former US Army General and listens (with two young
AIDES) to a radio-speaker on the tabletop
STRANGERS VOICE
(continuing through speaker)
« « « beCause he was and is a mighty
nunter
CAESARS VOICE
And what is his message
Through the tent flap we focus briefly on a distand old-type

bomber piane being serviced by humans and
CUT BACK TO
Aldos Headquarters

STRANGER
Set our people free

An amused silence

CAESAR
No

STRANGER
Or else -

CAESAR

stung to anger)
Did you set us free when we were
your slaves There can be no or else

STRANGER
(quietly)
Caesar there can We have a plane
and we have a bomb

MACDONALD
(softly)
Christ
STRANGER
A bomb that could reduce this city -

which is the Capital of your Empire -
to rubble

CUT TO

The North PULLING BACK from the exterior shot of bomb ready
for loading onto a plane ready for fuelling NIMROD and AIDES
listening intently to the radio-speakers crackling silence
AIDE 1
That shook ‘em

AIDE 2
Now theyll turn the heat on

CAESARS VOICE
(through speaker)
Where is this Nimrod

CUT TO

Aldots Headquarters

STRANGER
I have told you In the North
ALDO
Where in the North
Silence
ALDO
(banging fist on table)
Where Where Where
Silence

ALDO
We can make you talk

STRANGER
I repeat if you harm one hair of
my head your City will be destroyed

CAESAR

Apes have ways of hutring without
harming Brutus

One of the Gorilla Guards clicks to attention

CAESAR
Show him
BRUTUS (from behind) thrusts his hands under the Strangers arms
locks fingers across the Strangers chest and with sundry expert
movements of the thumbs begins to apply a pressure which
(though it never wipes the scornful smile off the Strangers
face) drenches him with the sweat of appalling pain We INTERCUT
the faces of the onlookers - starting on the Clerk and ending
on Macdonald who winces at the sudden sickening crunch of
what seem to be breaking bones Caesar and Aldo leap simultaneously
to their feet
CAESAR
You fat-knuckled idiot Youve
broken his ribs
But Rrutus is feeling the Strangers chest under his shirt and

shaking his head

BRUTUS

No no
ALDO

Then what have you broken
BRUTUS

This

And from under the shirt he extracts a small smashed plastic
microphone attached to a miniature transmitter concealed in

the shirts inner pocket

ALDO
(indicating Stranger
to Guard 2
Shoot him
MACDONALD
Caesar - 1
CAESAR

The damage is done We have been
heard Our City is infected Cleanse
itt
As Guerd 2s gun fires and blood spreads across the shirt of the

still-smiling Stranger
CUT TO

The North Nimrod and “Aides (the two latter are the pilots
who will undertake the mission) calculate that the time required
for fuelling the plane installing the bomb and reaching the
target will be X hours We the audience therefore know that

there isa dangerously short time-limit for the completion of

Caesars countermeasures These are not unsubtle Modern

City is of course equipped with deep shelters which when

first constructed were designed to accommodate the Human
population only In the event of a nuclear attack Apes would
have been left to fend for themselves The situation must

now be reversed though the reversal is tempered with a modicum

of mercy Caesar breaks into the holiday celebrations with a

dramatic Proclamation of Emergency on PA and TV The threat
(he says) may be a hoax but the Council are taking no risks

Deep shelters shall for the moment immediately be occupied

by Apes only

Thereafter (says Caesar) whatever shelter space remains
available shall be allocated to Humans selected on a priority
basis for their potential usefulness to Ape Society Humans
are asked to stand by public TV screens till those selected
have been summoned (by their personal numbers) to fill
vacancies in designated shelters Those not selected must find

what shelter they can in subways and cellars

Throughout Caesars announcement we INTERCUT its panic-effect
on the holiday-making populace - in the restaurant where
half-eaten meals are left unfinished in the playground where
the Ape Children dont want to be parted from their Human
Teacher Lindy and in the Barbers Shop etc etc

At length the Apes are gone - leaving the Civic Center scattered
with holiday-litter and bewildered Humans An elderly MALE
as though in a trance begins automatically to sweep the litter

from the sidewalks Like a Zombie

Caesar exits a conference with his Councilors (ali are united
in adversity) and invites Macdonald to share the sanctuary
of his VIP shelter To Caesars distress Macdonald at
first refuses He prefers to stay (and if need be die) with

his own people Caesar gently argues ending

CAESAR
Macdonald it is wrong for a ruler
to be in his servants debt You
saved my life twice I command you
to allow me to save yours
MACDONALD
And if I refuse
Caesar smiles and puts an arm on Macdonalds shoulder

CAESAR
I1l have you shot

Macdonald smiles too and gives in They have reached

The Robing Room where Lisa (alone) pleads to be allowed to
take her two human maids MARY and ANNA into the shelter
Reluctantly Caesar feels compelled to restrict her to one
Humans selected for shelter will chiefly be those who can

serve not individuals but the State Poor Lisa She will have
to make a difficult choice

In the North the bomb is about to be installed in the plane
and we learn something that Nimrod and the two Pilots have
known all along that this is possibly a suicide mission with
a conceivable point of no return Nimrod has gambled all but
and small reserve-percentage of his precious fuel on a death-blow
to Caesars capital city The Pilots have enough fuel to

reach the target area drop the bomb and (with luck and good
weather) fly clear of the holocaust before effecting a forced

landing on their way home to the North
20

NOTE In the above scene we visvally (and unassertively)
establish that Nimrods campsite includes a car
graveyard containing veteran vehicles of the 1970s
and 1980s A handful of humans are working (without
special urgency) to restore or service these

CUT TO

Exterior shots of Apes descending into various shelters - many

clutching suitcases and bags of food some with (Ape) chiléren

One heavily-guarded shelter is also the City Arsenal filled

with boxes of ammunition and crates of srall arms We end on

VIP shelter with Caesar Lisa Pan Aldo Zeno other

Councilors and Aides Macdonald and the valet George Outside

the two huran maids Anna and Mary approach the shelter with

confidence Lisa cannot bear to watch the heart-rending scene

as Anna is given access and Mary is excluded
In the North the bomb is installed in the plane

In the Civic Center the lower-calibre humans (such as sweepers
cleaners laborers) cluster round an outdoor TV screen waiting
praying that their names may be called Indoors the higher-
calibre technicians teachers medics etc watch their own TY
sets in small sparsely furnished rooms and shared apartments
The sets are switched on but the screers stay silent and black

until
A VOICE booms out over Civic Center

Attention all Humans

The screen brightens to reveal a (Chimpanzee)

ANNOUNCER

(as we INTERCUT listeners)
The following will report immediately
to Shelter 9 at the intersection of
Caesar Avenue and Armando Street
They will wear their identity discs
and carry no baggage except such
portable tools and devices as are
vital to the useful prosecution of
their profession or their trade
Their mates (whether male or female)
will not be admitted to the shelter
and no human child shall be released
from the School Pound where second-
class shelter is available in the
cellars

Now as the Announcer (seen on various screens) calls each name
and number - preceded by an initial letter denoting his or
her calibre - we CUT or PAN to the names owner Thus ona

small indoor screen

ANNOUNCER
A34577 Clement veterinary surgeon

We PAN off TV screen to Clem a handsome young vet in his
surgery With a sigh of relief he begins methodically to put

instruments and drugs into his medical bag

There could be trouble brewing

We continue to CROSS-CUT this call-up of the Hurans in Modern
City with the progress of the planets preparation in the North
and it may be assumed that whenever we CUT to the North further
names are being called in the South - names whose owners we
shall only meet for the first time in the pictures second

half Meanwhile after the calling up of (say) an architect

and an engineer we

WH Auden

We PULL BACK to two men in a room whose shelves jointly

accommodate the books of the psychiatrist (LEX) and the
technical parphernalia of the radio-ham (FRANK) Lex is
thin bespectacled and frail Frank - dark saturnine and
compact emanates the same dynamic power as the man we called
The Stranger

LEX

(sincerely)
I‘m sorry Frank

But Frank is brooding and doesnt answer Lex surveys his books

LEX
I guess my baggage is all
in my head I11 just take soap
and a toothbrush
(fingering his weak chin)
And maybe grow a beard at last

His fingers have touched the cord of his identity-dise which

he pulls out from under his shirt And Frank stares at it

LEX
Mustnt lose this

FRANK
You might as well

LEX
Might as well what

FRANK
Lose it Lex

LEX

(alarmed )

Frank what dtyou want

FRANK

I want to survive Lex

He snatches at the disc and pulls it so that the cord bites
into the back of Lexs neck
LEX
(resisting)
Frank you cant get away with it
Youfre not a psychiatrist Youre a
radio technician
Frank begins to twist the disc so that the cord twists too

Just before Lex is (inevitably) strangled we
CUT TO

Shots of low-calibre unselected Humans drifting dazed and
terrified about the darkening streets They begin to coalesce

into a Mob

Selected Humans queuing to go down into Shelter 9 Their
identity-discs are checked against a typed list at the head

of the descending stone stairway Lindy approaches checkpoint
followed by Frank

elbow to prevent a fall

LINDY
Thank you Mr Alexander

(grinning)
Call me Lex

More Humans at the end of the queue go down down down down

And in the North the two Pilot-Aides go up up up into the

plane

Dusk The unselected Mob marches on a Bank Therell be
vaults there and maybe money for later - if there is a
later They are smashing the windaws with broom handles

when the last Ape Police Squad to patrol the City opens fire

A pitched battle ensues between a Squad with firearms and a

Mob (superior in numbers) armed only with brooms picks spades
hammers etc Inevitably many Humans are massacred but some
climb through the broken glass and vanish into the Bank A
siren wails summoning all Ape personnel back into the shelters

The Police Squad recedes Silence broken by

Exterior The planets four great jet engines suddenly roar
into earsplitting life We PULL BACK to include Nimrod and his

Army assembled to bid the revving-up plane farewell

Shots of shelter doors sliding shut Night is falling on
Modern City

With a thunderous roar the plane takes off and heads south
into the deepening dusk
26
Interior of plane Tense technical dialogue between the
two (doomed) Pilots The fuel and altimeter dials of the
veteran plane are established Its condition is less than

perfect

The red and yellow flags and poster-portraits of Caesar flutter
over darkening streets deserted and empty except outside the
Bank where wounded Human Survivors of the massacre still

faintly moan and stir From a poster-portrait we

enigmatic future We end on

Impressive GROUND-SHOT of Modern City by night Streetlamps

have lit automatically and some windows are lit though empty
From his shelter Caesar orders a General Blackout

INSERT A hairy Orangutan hand throws a switch (or switches)

in subterranean power house

FULL SHOT City All the lights go out And very very
gradually in the long momentous silence we hear the drone of
the approaching plane As it loudens one of the engines

begins to stutter

The drone and the stutter can just (but only just) be heard by
an elderly female human SUPERVISOR in the cellars of the School
Pound where she sits surrounded by scared human CHILDREN

She takes a pectoral cross from its concealment in her bosom and

holds it towards the children

SUPERVISOR
Children this is called the cross of
Christ who is still said secretly by
many of us to be the Son of God Iet
us pray for our safety to Him and to
His Father Repeat after me
Our Father

The City No sound of the detonation But night slowly

brightens into day and the day slowly dazzles We catch the
classic Hiroshima glimpse of a stray HUMAN backed against a
stone wall Then his body vanishes and only his silhouette
remains burnt into the wall which splits The screen
bleaches to a white blinding incandescence and the thunder

of crashing masonry deafens us as the now invisible City

founders
Only later shall we learn what happened to the plane

- Ape-wielded picks striking on stones as cave-like
dwellings are scooped out of rock under the supervision
of a Human ARCHITECT who from time to time unrolls
paper-plans and deferentially issues further suggestions

to the workers

Apes raise and anchor a tall flagpole at its center

beside which others are erecting a dais

- Impressionistic glimpses of Apes being taught under
Human supervision to cultivate the land - eg seed
sowing vine growing digging or even ploughing

but must convey that in terms of food the community

is becoming self-sufficient)

exterminated the inhabitants have access to furs

ZAIA
The Doctor says that every human
being above the level of an idiot
develops a speech-center on one side
of the brain depending on whether he
is left or right handed There are
modern procedures which so pinpoint
the speech-center and the audio and
visual areas tied in With it that
ali the faculties concerned could be
obliterated - as painlessly as they
would be by an electrically induced
stroke

Could Man so treated still serve

succeeded in exterminating

Scarcely has Aléo spoken than a shell explodes short of the Human

Ape counter-attack Even as they leave two more shelis destroy
the Human Compound - but not before the Children have escaped in
the confusion through the perimeter fence of wooden stakes planted

too closely for adult Humans to wriggle through

Nimrod has destroyed the Humans intentionally They are “collazorezctr

with the Apes and constitute a Fifth column that must be exterminate

The main Ape-Human battle is joined in the rocky open country betweer
the site of Modern City and Ape City Basically it is a battle
between Humans driving veteran vehicles with the reckless abandon of
stock cars and Apes on foot or horseback But the Apes armory
(cannon and small-arms brought from the Modern City Arsenal) is
bigger and more up-to-date than Nimrods They have also been

tausht (when building Ape City) to lay and detonate explosive
charges which they use to deadly effect in rear of Nimrods out-
flanked Army The battle rages with the do-or-die intensity of
Custers Last Stand Nets too are brought into use and the

snarled-up vehicles are pounded by gunfire into immobility

4 hansoal of Human survivors flee for refuge to the cave mouth
wnose Location they know They are joined in flight by the
escapes children and the group enters the cave mouth to descend

inte Mutantville below

Ape Scouts have observed this and Aldo now advances his cavalry
in and Pinal charge which isolates Nimrod and is driving him back

lexarss the cave mouth when

Fréx the cave mouth itself Danny the Gunsmith and Mutant Technicians
re vhe mystericus projectile which falls just short of the
acvancing Apes and momentarily halts them It doesnt explode but
it ticks and while it ticks Mutant 1s voice on a loud hailer

makes an announcement

ihe projectile contains (says the voice) a sophisticated and once-

vep-secret nerve gas which (through the innocent appearance of its

néers) escaped detection by the Apes in the old Arsenal The
e2ass volatility is as considerable as its operational range and
ius specific effect is painlessly to induce sterility and therefore
cescroy reproductivity in those who inhale it It is if you like

tc tail it so a Genocide Zomb And it will explode in X seconds

Zeno and Aldo need only briefly confer before deciding to retreat -
for the Ape Race must survive by breeding if it is to fulfill its
mission of dominating Mankind As the Apes gallop away the ticking
stops and the projectile explodes - too soon (we suspect) to save

the Apes from sterility

Mutant 1 now appears in the cave mouth to greet

NIMROD
They call me Nimrod but my name
is General Mendez Ive

come to offer my services to the
Human cause

(pausing in the

cave mouth)
Whats the name of the nerve gas
in that projectile

MUTANT 1
It has no name

NIMROD
Because its so secret

MUTANT 1
It has no secret either It doesnt
exist The projectile was empty
Back in Ape City Zeno reads a proclamation ordaining that from this
day Aldo and himself will be the City’s joint rulers He also
ordains that the infected land between Modern City and Ape City
shall be called the Forbidden Zone (see Apes 1 and 2) and begins

to deliver the first of the anti-Human homilies later to be

Mendez is the name of the dynasty that is one day to rule Mutantvilie

We met Mendez XXVII in Apes 2

incorporated in the Scrolls of the Lawgiver - by which name he
will be remembered for the next thousand years As he speaks

rom the cave mouth a little group of our Huran Children ererce
cautiously almost furtively and peer into the sunset
MATILDA

What can he do down there but
pine and diel

LITTLE BOY
He belongs with his own kind

And they part to reveal the Baby Chimp (who has grown a bit since
we last saw him) being given a helping hand to the foreground He
looks this way and that sniffs the evening air and then walks away

s alone as Chaplin into the sunset and the land of his fethers

Over this we roll up
