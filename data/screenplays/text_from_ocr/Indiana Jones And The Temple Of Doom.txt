FADE IN

INT THE DRAGON NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

A Chinese GONG SOUNDS and the glittering doors of an art Deco

poda slide open to reveal a mammoth silver stairway down which
rows of beautiful women start descending (BEGIN MAIN TITLES)

The lovely ladies are a mix of races and they sing a strange
haunting melody -- one might think them a heavenly choir if it

werent for their sexy clinging lame gowns

INT CLUB ENTRANCE
From the ethereal beauties we cut to a street urchins dirty
face SHORT ROUND is a ten-year-old Chinese kis wearing a beat-

up American baseball cap

Sneaking into the club Short Round weaves past the fancy gowns
and silk suits heading toward the music in the main ballroom

INT THE BALLROOM

Short Round enters and stares across the smoky nightclub On

stage he sees a giant paper-mache dragon laying curled around
the pagoda

Now the dragons eyes light up its nostrils exhale smoke and
its enormous jaws open Out of the dragons mouth walks the

star

of the stage show

WILLIE SCOTT a dreamy beauty singing a sultry solo white the
or-

chestra wails the accompaniment

But Short Rounds not here to ogle crooning dames He surveys

the rich Chinese American and European revelers Jewels flash

and champagne flows Short Round finally spots a table of

somber-looking Chinese men in suits

Short Round chews gum and stares at the men Then he turns to

go WU HAN a waiter with a scar across his cheek watches
Short

Round leave
4 INT CLUB ENTRANCE

As Short Round hurries toward the exit he bumps into a man in
a

tuxedo entering the club Short Round looks up at the man but

we dont see his face

Then Short Round is grabbed by the scruff of his neck anda
door-

man hustles him out the door Short Round yelling insults all
the

way

A maitre d apologizes to the man in the tuxedo and two hat-
check

girls smile at him familiarly as he continues into the
ballroom

We notice something incongruous the man in the tuxedo is
wear-

ing work boots caked with mud
5 INT THE BALLROOM

The man in the tuxedo stops to watch Willie Scott singing
sexily

on the stage Then he looks around and sees the table of
somber

Chinese men that Short Round spotted earlier
As the man in the tuxedo walks toward the table he removes a
cigarette from a silver case He arrives at the table just as
the chorus and orchestra reach a crescendo --

And on the stage a glistening muscular slave swings a huge

ham-
mer toward an enormous brass gong --
The man in the tuxedo leans to receive a light froma
cigarette-
girl and as the GONG BOOMS the match flares to reveal his
face
for the first time
Its INDIANA JONES Elegant in a tuxedo -- dressed to kill
The
TITLES END and over this a legend appears on the screen
SHANGHAI - 1935
At the table the four Chinese man in suits stare coldly at
Indi-
ana
LAO
Dr Jones
INDIANA
Lao She
LAO
Nee chin lie how ma
Laos men laugh and assume that Indy doesnt understand his
joke

INDIANA
Wah hung how nee nah Wah hwey
hung jing chee jah loo nee kao
soo wah shu shu

LAO SHE looks angry and his mens smiles fade

LAO
You never told me you spoke my
language Dr Jones

INDIANA
I dont like to show off

Indiana takes a seat across the table from Shanghais notorious
crime-lord Lao is fifty wealthy enough to now display some
fat but still muscular from his fight to the top of the
garbage
heap

LAO
For this special occasion I
ordered champagne and caviar

Indiana looks at the pile of caviar on the plate in front of
him

-- and stubs his cigarette out in it The cigarette sizzles
and

Laos smiles dies with it

Theres applause as Wille Scott finishes her song At the
table Lao stares at Indiana with a strange intensity

LAO
So it is true Dr Jones you
found Nurhachi

INDIANA
Sure I found him Then last
night I had a little trouble
Somebody tried to slit my throat

Indiana looks across the table at Laos son CHEN who
resembles
a bulldog and snarls like one now

INDIANA (Contd)
It was dark but I think one of
your sons tried to get Nurhachi
without paying for him

Indy stares pointedly at Chens recently bandaged hand Chen

mutters and stands angrily -- Lao barks a command in Chinese
and

Chen sits down again

LAO
You have insulted my son

INDIANA
Next time Ill cut off more than
his finger

LAO
Dr Jones -- I want Nurhachi

Lao pulls a wad of cash out of his pocket and puts it on the
table Indiana glances at it
INDIANA
As I recall the deal was consid-
erably more

Now a pretty hand slips onto Laos shoulder and he looks up to
see Willie Scott Lao kisses her hand Willie is unaware of

the
explosive mood at the table and she smiles flirtaciously at
Indi-
ana
WILLIE
(to Lao)
Arent you going to introduce
us
LAO
This is Willie Scott
(watching Indy)
And this is Indiana Jones the
famous archaeologist
Willie sits down between Lao and Indy She takes out a small
mirror to check her make-up
LAO (Contd)
Dr Jones found Nurhachi for me
and is about to deliver him --
now
Lao nods across the table and Indy sees KAO KAN Laos second
son open his coat and remove a silver-plated pistol Indiana
looks worried Willie doesnt notice as she fixes her make-up
and coyly teases Indiana
WILLIE
Well -- I thought archaeologists
were always funny little men
searching for their mummies --
(yelping)
Aaahhh
She looks down terrified at the knife Indy is poking against
her

ribs

WILLE (Contd)
I was only kidding cant you
take a joke --

(to Lao)
Lao hes got a knife
tawdry

Lao

that

cham-

into

he

INDIANA
Put the gun away sonny

Kao Kan glances at his father Lao finally nods to his son and
he slips the pistol back into his pocket

INDIANA
Now I suggest you pay me what you
promised -- or your girlfriend

here is going to be squealing a
new tune

The ritzy patrons at the tables nearby are unaware of the
drama quietly unfolding at this table
Willie eyes the blade and whimpers She looks imploringly at

and he slowly reaches into his pocket He puts ten gold coins
next to the cash on the table

Indy leans forward to look at the gold coins -- so intently
he fails to notice Kao Kan spilling some powder into Indys
pagne glass
INDIANA
Try again Lao -- the deal was
more
The knife pokes Willie and she whimpers again Lao reaches
another pocket and brings out a folded piece of rice paper --
opens it and a large diamond and ruby spill out onto the table
INDIANA (Contd)
Bingoyou see Lao with a
but of persuasion even you can
be an honest fellow
Indy smiles and jabs the knife into the middle of the table

Then he lifts his champagne glass in a toast to Lao -- who
watches expectantly as Indiana moves the glass toward his lips

Suddenly Willie stands angrily jostling Indys arm so that he
doesnt drink his champagne

WILLIE
Wil-

his

white

fear

Look at this He put a hole
in my dress from Paris

Lao sees Indy put his champagne glass down and he snarls at

lie --

Sit down

Willie quickly obeys Lao forces a smile at Indy and lifts his
glass to seal the deal --

LAO (Contd)
To your health Dr Jones

Lao sips hs champagne and watches hopefully as Indy picks up

glass and this time Indy does drink the champagne Then he
reaches for the cash --

But Chen grins and puts a silver snuff bottle next to the cash
gold and jewels -- he tips the little bottle over and some

powder spills out of it --

INDIANA
Whats that

LAO
A bonus Dr Jones That is
poison You just drank the
rest of it

Indiana examines his champagne glass and sees a residue at the
bottom of it He swallows and feels sick wondering it its

or the poison already taking effect

LAO (Contd)
There is an antidote for this
poison You give me Nurhachi --
I give you the antidote

Indiana is sweating Willie looks at him and sees Indys hand
shaking

LAO (Contd)
The poison works fast Dr Jones
Where is Nurhachi
gold

Lao

and

Indiana finally reaches into his pocket Next to the cash
jewels and poison Indiana sets down a beautiful small box

and his men stare hypnotically at the exquisite gold and enamel
box

WILLIE
(nervously)
This Nurhachis a very small guy

Nobody pays any attention to her as Lao reaches for the box

INDIANA
Inside are the remains of Nur-
hachi -- the first Emperor of the

Manchu Dynasty

Lao opens the box carefully and stares reverently at the grey
powder inside

INDIANA (Contd)
Now what about the antidote
Lao

LAO
(holding the box)
At last I have the ashes of my
sacred ancestor

WILLIE
So whats the big deal Let
me see it --

Qillie grabs Laos arm and some of the precious ashes spill out
of the gold box Stunned by this desecration of his ancestor
Lao grabs Willie by the wrist and twists her arm --

LAO
You fool

WILLIE
Ow youre hurting me you miser-
able little hood

INDIANA
Let go of her Lao And give me
the antidote

Lao just laughs evilly -- until a waiter moves up behind Lao

the crimelord suddenly stiffens He lets go of Willies wrist
and raises his hands off the table Chen stops collecting the
money and jewels

Kao Kan tenses and Indy smiles at Wu Han the Chinese waiter

with
the scar who is standing behind Lao Wu Han has a towel over
his hand -- under it he has a pistol pressed against Laos
spine
INDIANA (Contd)
(smiling at Wu Han)
I like the service here
WILLIE
(puzzled)
Hey hes not a waiter
INDIANA
No Wu Hans an old friend I
brought along
(to Lao)
So the games not over Put
the antidote on the table Lao
Lao carefully reaches into his pocket and puts a small glass
vial
of liquid next to the cash gold jewels poison and sacred
box
Indy looks relieved as he reaches for the vial of antidote --
then he hears a muffled report And another
Wu Han groans and sways Indy starts to stand but Chen immedi-
ately turns the smoking pistol with the silencer that he used
to
kill Wu Han -- Indy sees it pointed at him now and he remains
in
his seat
Kao Kan stands and grabs Wu Han easing the phoney waiter into
the chair he just vacated The muffled shooting hasnt
attracted

any attention The nightclub activity continues an Indy speaks
emotionally to his dying friend

INDIANA
Wu Han -- listen to me -- Im
going to get you out of here

In pain Wu Han looks at Indy and struggles to speak --

WU HAN
Not this time my friend
(smiling bravely)
I followed you on many adventures --
but into the great Unknown Mystery
I go first Indy

Wu Han dies and slumps forward Indiana is shattered by the
death of his old friend

LAO
Dont be sad Dr Jones -- you
will soon join him

Indys gaze shifts from his dead friend to Laos sneering face
Then Indy sees the murderous Chen giggling perversely Indys
anger is compounded by the poison burning in his gut and his

vis-

ion of Chens ugly face blurs into a double image --

Indy stands up unsteadily Chen assumes hes about to keel
over

from the poison -- but Indy suddenly turns and grabs a real
wai-

ter at another table The waiter holds a long skewer of
roasted

pigeons that hes just set afire --

Indy grabs the skewer of pigeons flambee and hurls is across
the

table Chen fires and misses -- and screams as the skewer
stabs

into his chest and the burning pigeons flame in front of his
hor-

rified face

This the other tables definitely notice There are screams and

all hell breaks loose Indiana shoves past Willie and reaches

for the vial on the table --

INDIANA
The antidote --

But hes grabbed from behind by Kao Kan Indy elbows the punk

reaches back and grabs his head -- and somersaults Kao Kan onto

the table

As nubmer two son crashes into the table the impact sends the

Emperor Nurhachis ashes billowing into Laos stricken face

Indiana yells as he sees the vial of antidote rolling across
the

table -- and falling
Laos

Indiana dives and catches the antidote just before it hits the
floor -- then Indys hand is brutally stomped on by one of

henchmen and the vial rolls away

Indiana angrily raises his head

smashing it up into the hench-

mans groin -- the man howls like a banshee and hobbles away

Meanwhile

Willie watches Lao grabbing for cash from the table

Willie lunges past the pigeon-skewered Chen to snatch the

to attack Indy

People keep kicking it -- he almost has it when Willie runs

trips and lands on her back

INDIANA

Look out

WILLIE

Who cares

Wheres that diamond

Gunfire explodes and they both scramble in different

ons

Indy dives through the fleeing nightclub patrons and slides be-

hind a water-spewing fountain
by Lao and his henchmen

Indy sees the vial of antidote
the marble floor -- feeling the
groddily and splashes water on

Meanwhile

She spots the diamond

Behind the fountain Indiana makes a break -- he runs and dives
on top of a serving cart The wheeled cart hurtles toward an

suspecting gunman crashes into him from behind and sends him
flying head first into a row of ice buckets

Nearby Willie slugs the other lady in the jaw and grabs for

elusive diamond just as the ice buckets showers ice across the
floor -- which camouflages the diamond

WILLIE
Aw nuts

Searching desperately for the jewel Willie sees the vial of
antidote spinning across the floor --as it slides by she grabs
it

INDIANA (0S)
Heydoll Dont move

She sees Indy speeding by atop the serving cart Lao and his
gunmen rush out to block the way Indy rolls off the cart and
slides behind a potted palm as Laos men open fire again
INDIANA (Contd)
(shouting to Willie)
Hey dont go away I need that
Willie smiles meanly as she slips the vial down the front of

dress thumbs her nose at Indiana and walks away

INDIANA (Contd)
If I wasnt dying Id kill her

Hiding behind the palm tree Indiana looks around and spots a

ant statue at the side of the stage Indy makes a break for

As the gunmen open fire Indy springs onto a chair -- jumps
a table -- and leaps onto the stage He grabs the golden
sword from the Chinese warrior statue

As bullets smash into the statue Indiana hides behind it
he jumps out and swings the large sword toward the enormous

gong
ex

behind

floor-

it

Oo) OV

Wil-

The crimson cord holding the gong is SLASHED Indy slings the
sword at his assailants and gives the three-meter-high gong a
helpful shove --

The giant gong rolls and echoes as it crashes down the marble
steps Indiana ducks behind it as it gains momentum and rolls
across the dance floor

Using the gong as an enormous shield Indy evades the gunfire

ploding -- bullets ricochet off the rolling brass gong as Indy
runs behind it

Ahead Willie hurries toward an exit -- she hears something and
turns -- her eyes go wide as she sees the mammoth gong bearing

down on her

Willie yells as Indiana grabs her arm and pulls her behind the
gong with him --

Lao watches amazed as he and his gunmen dodge tables trying to
get better firing positions -- and more henchmen come into the
club now and start firing machine guns

As bullets clang against the gong Indiana and Willie run

it Willie hollers as they head directly for a towering
to-ceiling window

Indiana grabs Willie around the waist and after the huge gong
crashes through the stained-glass window they both fly after
EXT THE DRAGON NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

n a shower of sparkling glass the enormous gong sails out and
crashes down a sloping green-tiled roof Indiana Jones and
lie Scott hurtle into the night air after it

The gong rolls down the roof and they hit the tiles behind it

ndiana holding onto Willie as they roll one-over-the-other
toward the edge -- Willie screams as they fall into thin air

fq

Their entwined bodies plummet three stories ripping through a
third-floor awning crashing through an old mans mattress ona
second-floor balcony --
Finally they smash through the convertible top of a parked
Duesen-

berg and fall into the back seat

7 INT THE DUESENBERG

Willie sits up wide-eyed speechless and amazed to be alive
Then she sees an equally astonished Short Round looking at them
from the front seat

SHORT ROUND
Wow Holy smoke Crash landing

INDIANA
Step on it Short Round

SHORT ROUND
Okey doke Indy Hold onto your
potatoes

The twelve-year-old Chinese kid turns his baseball cap bill-
backwards and steps on the gas The tires squeal as the car
roars off --

WILLIE

ing the car

INDIANA
Relax Ive been giving him lessons

8 EXT THE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

The Duesenberg races past the entrace to the nightclub as Lao
and his man rush out and jump into two black sedans The
sedans
screech off in pursuit of the Duesenberg
9 INT THE DUESENBERG

As Short Round eagerly swerves around a corner Willie holds on
for dear life Indiana suddenly puts his hand down the front
of

Willies dress --

WILLIE

INDIANA
Dont get your hopes up -- wheres

Indiana withdraws his hand having finally found the vial He
opens is quickly tips the vial to his lips and grimaces as he
swallows the stuff

WILLIE
You dont look very good

INDIANA
Poison never agrees with me
(shouting forward)
Pull a right Short Round and
head for the Wang Poo bridge

SHORT ROUND
Check Gotcha

As the car accelerates Indy peers out the back window at their
pursuers Willie notices her reflection in the side window --

WILLIE
Look at what youve done to me
Im amess My lipsticks smeared
I broke two nails Ive got an aw-
ful run in my stocking --

Gunfire suddenly explodes bullets whizz through the canvas top
and the rear window shatters and sprays glass Willie ducks

cringes terrified in the corner --
INDIANA
Somehow I think youve got bigger

problems

Indy grabs his shoulder bag and pulls a pistol out of it He
pokes the gun through the broken window and starts firing back

their pursuers -- then he turns and looks ahead
INDIANA (Contd)
There Shorty Through the
tunnel
Through the windows we see the car racing into a tunnel

from the pursuing cars flash through the rear window and

echoes in the tunnel
WILLIE
Whatre we going to do Wherere

INDIANA
The airportNo look out
Short Round Left left

Indy reaches over the front seat and helps Short Round

navigate
10 EXT A SHANGHAI SQUARE - NIGHT

The Duesenberg tears around the square followed by Laos two
se-
dans People on the street dive for cover -- coolies pulling
rickshaws go into hyper-jov --lanterns spanning the street
crash
down and are dragged behind the Duesenberg Bullets exlode and
amazed prostitutes watch the cars zoom past
11 INT THE DUESENBERG - NIGHT

The chaotic chase continues -- bullets whine past and the
shred-

ded convertible top whips in the wind

INDIANA
(shouting)

SHORT ROUND

Shorty throws an envelope back and Indy looks at the three
tickets

INDIANA

ment

from Indy)

EXT COUNTRY HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Leaving behind the squalid port the Duesenberg flies along the
highway through the trees In a moment Laos two sedans race
by

EXT NANG TAO AIRFIELD - NIGHT

The Duesenberg swings around a curve and skids through gravel
ward the airfield In the distance there is a small terminal
Short Round wheels the car toward the cargo area --

A two-engine passenger plane is revving its motors and the last
passengers are boarding The Duesenberg squeals to a stop and
Indy jumps out with Willie and Short Round right on his heels

A contingent of airport Military Police move to bar their way
until WEBER a heavy-set Englishman runs up pufffing and

ing

WEBER
No no theyre all right
Let them through please

INDIANA
Thanks Weber

WEBER
Dr Jones this is positively the
last time our airline can hold a
plane for you Now you must hurry
While Short Round grabs a small bag out of the car Weber and a
stewardess take their tickets and rush them all toward the air-
plane

Meanwhile the two sedans skid to a stop and Lao and his son

Kao
Kan jumpsout with their henchmen The puzzled military police
advance on them usspiciously --
Realizing hes outnumbered Lao instructs his men to stay back
and to put away their weapons
14 EXT THE AIRPLANE

Willie and Short Round charge up the ladder and onto the plane
Indy pauses at the top of the steps to give Lao a cocky
farewell
salute Indy boards the plane and the co-pilot slams the door
15 EXT THE AIRFIELD

The plane starts taxiing By the cars Lao is buffeted by the
prop wash as he angrily watches the plane roll away Behind
Lao
his son Kao Kan stares at the plane taking off -- a look on
Kao
Kans face indicates that he hasnt given up yet
The plane lifts off the airfield silhouetted against the
clouds
and the first light of dawn
CUT TO
16 EXT THE DKY - MORNING

The sun flashes above the horizon and the plane banks through
white billowing clouds at it heads west
17 INT THE PLANE

A door opens at the rear of the plane and Indiana Jones exits
wearing more familiar attire a beat-up leather jacket over a
khaki shirt and a snap-brim hat He passes a dozen passengers
as

he moves up the aisle carrying his rolled-up tuzedo
In the first row Willie is busy fixing her make-up Shorty
sits

in the seat across the aisle from her Indy comes up and drops

his tuxedo onto the floor

Willie sees him hook his coiled bullwhip over a coat-peg

WILLIE
So whatre you supposed to be
a lion tamer

INDIANA
Since I was nice enough to let
you tag along why dont you give
your mouth a rest Okay doll

Indy pats her leg -- she removes his hand and reaches down and
picks up his tuxedo coat She slips it on

WILLIE
Im freezing What do you mean
tag along From the minute you
walked into that nightclub you
havent been able to keep your
eyes off me

INDIANA
Oh yeah

He smiles and tips his hat down over his eyes to go to sleep

18 INT THE COCKPIT

At the same moment the Chinese co-pilot tips his hat up off
his
eyes -- and looks scared to death He exclaims in Chinese --

CO-PILOT (subtitled)
Good lord

He and the pilot see two biplanes materialize out of the clouds
and dive directly toward them Suddenly machine gunfire
erupts

PILOT (subtitled)
Dive for the clouds Dive

19 EXT THE SKY - DAY

DC-3 like a hawk about to bring down a sparrow

INT THE COCKPIT

The biplanes swoop past both sides of the plane and bursts of
gunfire rip along the fuselage

CO-PILOT (subtitled)
They hit a fuel line

PILOT (subtitled)
Reduce speed -- get everyone out

INT THE PASSENGER CABIN

As the air battle rages the passengers are tossed about and
start screaming Short Round peers out a window

SHORT ROUND
Lao send planes to kill Indy

Willie shakes Indys arm but he continues snoring under his
WILLIE
Wake up Its the drug he drank

to stop the poison --

The cockpit door bursts open and the Chinese co-pilot exits to
make an announcement -- he smiles and speaks in CHINESE then

smiles and speaks in FRENCH --

Willie looks lost until the Chinese co-pilot smiles again and
speaks in ENGLISH --

CO-PILOT
Please to remain calm We start
passing out parachutes now --

The co-pilot hurries toward the rear Willie looks petrified
a stewardess rushes up and hands her a parachute
WILLIE

You got to be kidding No No
I cant

Round

The pilot hurries out of the cockpit and grabs his parachute as
he heads toward the back

WILLIE (Contd)
Wait -- whos flying the plane

She opens the door to the cockpit --

WILLIE (Contd)
Nobodys flying the plane

EXT THE SKY - DAY

The DC-3 smokes through the clouds Passengers are bailing out
-- parachutes billowing As one of the fighters swoops through
the parachutes Kao Kan searches the faces -- then he points at
the DC-3
KAO KAN
(into the radio)
Jones Indiana Jones

The two planes roar off and start strafing the DC-3 again

INT THE PASSENGER CABIN

The co-pilot has a parachute on and is trying to get Short
into one

CO-PILOT
Put it on Whats wrong with
you Youve got to jump

SHORT ROUND
No cant leave Indy

Short Round suddenly butts the co-pilot in the stomach with his
head The co-pilot yells and falls out the door Short Round
sees the co-pilots parachute billow Then Willie rushes up

WILLIE

She grabs the parachute and starts to fight Shorty over it--

Round jumps for it -- the parachute falls out the door and

Willie grabs him by the seat of his pants and hauls him back
the abyss

EXT THE SKY - DAY

The fighters peel off toward the DC-3 with their guns flaming
another attack

INT THE PASSENGER CABIN

Short Round tries to wake Indy again Finally Shorty grabs
Indys bag pulls his holster out of it and runs toward the

Indy continues to sleep -- until bullets smash the window by

head and a fire extinguisher is hit and starts spraying into
Indys face

He finally awakens and jumps up He looks around is disbelief
the battle-torn nearly-empty airplane
INDIANA
(groggily)
We there yet

Indiana sees Shorty shooting his pistol out the side door as

planes swoop by again Out of ammo Shorty throws the gun
angrily at the passing plane

Indiana picks up his whip and attaches it to his belt as Willie
runs over to him

WILLIE
Theres nobody flying the plane

INT THE COCKPIT

The door flies open and Indy rushes in with Willie behind him
Indy appraises the situation quickly and jumps into the pilots
seat with total confidence --

WILLIE (Contd)
You know how to fly

Indy surveys the control panels the myraid of dials and
switches --

INDIANA
No
(hopefully)
Do you
27 INT THE PASSENGER CABIN

Willie runs screaming out of the cockpit her last hope
shatter-
ed Shorty is pulling something out of the cargo compartment -

hes found a machine gun and sets it up on a short tripod
SHORT ROUND
Come here lady hold this and

shut up please

He pulls Willie down to the floor and shoves her the ammunition
belt thats draped toward the gun Then Shorty jumps behind

the
machine gun --
As the first fighter appears off their side Short Round blasts
out the open door The machine gun explodes to life chewing
bullets smoking and spitting shells at Willie --
Willie hollers terrified by manages to feed the ammo belt as
Short Round sights the blazing machine gun -- suddenly he
shoops
Willie sees the fighter hit -- it smokes and veers away -- and

then EXPLODES

SHORT ROUND
I get it

WILLIE
You got it

The second plane swoops down and Short Round blasts away This
time as he swivels the gun he misses and hits one of the DC-

en-

own engines and it explodes

SHORT ROUND
Oh oh -- big mistake

INT THE COCKPIT

Trying to figure out the controls Indy looks up to see their
gine explose into flames --

INDIANA

(angrily)
Short Round what in the hell
are you doing

Suddenly the DC-3 emerges out of a cloud and Indy sees they are
headed directly for a mountain He pulls back hard on the con-

trols as a rocky peak looms lethally in front of them

EXT THE SKY - DAY

The DC-3 lifts at the last second and smashes some snow off the
uppermost pinnacle as it clears the mountain by inches

Kao Kans fighter is glued to the DC-3s tail and continues to
strafe -- but the fighter pilot pulls up too late -- and the
fighter explodes as it hits the peak of the mountain

INT THE PASSENGER CABIN
Indy rushes out of the smoking cockpit to find Willie and Short
Round crawling out from under the debris thats fallen on them

Then Indy spots something in the wreckage --

He pulls at some yellow canvas and Willie sees as sign

EMERGENCY

around

LIFE RAFT Indy drags the folded canvas over to the open door

WILLIE
Are you crazy a lift raft Were
not sinking were crashing

INDIANA
Get over here damn it Short Round
come on grab onto me tight

Willie sees Short Round rush over to Indiana and grab him

and

and

and

of

the waist from behind Willie finally jumps up and runs over -
WILLIE
Wait for me
She throws her arms around Indys neck so that she and Shorty
both hugging him from behind Indy clutches the folded lift

in front of him and surveys the mountainside rushing close be-
neath the skinking airplane --

Finally an instant before the plane will hit Indy dives and
pulls the inflation cord

EXT THE SKY

As the smoking DC-3 screams out of control toward the mountain
skimming the rocky snow-covered slopes we see the lift raft
spilling out the open door --

The raft pops into its full shape acting now as a spoiler

ing against the rushing wind and finally crashing and bouncing
against the snowy mountainside

In the distance we see the DC-3 finally kiss the earth and ex-
plode in a cloud of flame against a rocky escarpment -- metal

earth mushrooming in a million directions

EXT THE MOUNTAINSIDE

As the raft rockets down the snow Indiana clutches the front

Willie and Short Round hold on for dear life on either side of
him

The raft plummets down the mountain crossing the timber-line

entering a forest Bouncing over a snow-hidden log the raft
shoots directly for a tree --

Indiana pulls on the perimeter rope rolls on his side and man-
ages to swerve the raft so it caroms offthe snow-drifted side

the tree trunk

Continuing its downhill run the raft smashes across a small
steam sending silvery water spraying

As the raft skids below the snow-level it starts bouncing over
rocky ground and its three passengers teeth start chattering

33 EXT A BLUFF

The yellow raft crashes through a tangle of bushes and then
plum-
mets toward a bluff The raft goes airborne over a small bluff
and lands with a splash in a slow-moving river
34 EXT THE RIVER

The life raft drifts down the river and Indy looks around and
smiles cockily at Willie and Short Round --
Their faces dont show gratitude but horror -- Indy hears
some-
thing and turns to see
35 EXT WHITE WATER RAPIDS

The raft is heading directly toward a surging stretch of
treach-

erous rapids Indiana looks less cocky as he and Willie and
Short Round hold on again for dear life

The raft plunges into the roaring torrent bouncing over rock-

swollen waves twisting and spinning through narrow gaps The

three helpless passengers are drenched in the thundering
cascades

of white water

Willie is hallering Short Round hangs on wide-eyed and even

Indy
looks terrified as the raft crashes down the rapids Finally
after one heart-stopping bounce the raft seems to slow
36 EXT RIVER CLEARING

The raft drifts out of the main part of the river and glides
to-
ward a clearing Its three soaked and bedraggled passengers
lie

motionless in the bottom
Indys hand drags alongside the raft his fingers leaving a

trail
in the almost still water Battered and exhausted but always
Indys bodyguard Shorty looks over at him worriedly --
SHORT ROUND
Indy
INDIANA
Okay Shorty
Indy looks over at Willie who is moaning
INDIANA (Contd)
You all right
WILLIE
No Im not cut out for the
kind of life you lead
(moaning)
Oh noI ripped my dress Where
are we anyway
The raft floats to a gentle stop -- we see it nudge against a
pair of dark feet Indy squints up into the sun and sees some-
thing
INDIANA
India
WILLIE
Holy cow -- India How do you
know were in --
She rolls over and yelps as she looks up at the bizarre
painted
face of a SHAMAN Silhoutted against the blazing sun the
skin-
ny little old man in a loincoloth stares down at them in the
raft
An eerie wind rises and howls The old man places his palms
to-
gether and moves his hands up to touch his forehead Willie
and
Short Round watch mystified as Indiana returns the old shamans
silent greeting
CUT TO
37 EXT THE MAYAPORE HILLS - DAY

Indya and Short Round follow the shaman and four peasants down

a
gutted path through barren rolling hills Willie is out of her
milieu stumbling along this forlorn landscape in high heels
tuxedo jacket and disheveled lame gown
She hears the old shaman talking to Indy and catches up with
them
to find out whats going on
WILLIE
(to Indiana)
Whatd he say
INDIANA
He told me they knew I was coming
here
WILLIE
What do you mean -- how
INDIANA
The old man saw it in a dream
WILLIE
Dream -- nightmare is more like it
INDIANA
He said thats whey they were at
river -- they were waiting for
the plane to fall down
He looks at her bewildered face and smiles faintly As they
walk a hot wind swirls dust around them a wind slowly
ravaging
what soil is left in this terribly blighted region
CuT TO
38 EXT MAYAPORE - DAY

At the base of the hills Mayapore village does nothing to re-
lieve the awful sense of devastation A desolate road runs
through the village along which groups of ptiifully poor vil-
lagers stare at the strangers being brought in
Hopeless women lift buckets from a dry well -- finding only
sand

Skinny miserable dogs skulk between the decrepit village huts
eyed by the patient vultures lurling in scraggly trees
Indiana notices the wretched peasants staring at Short Round
some of them pointing at him a few haggard women shedding

tears

down their wrinkled faces as the little Chinese boy passes

There is no sign of children in the village and Short Round
grows

frightened by the odd attention He moves closer to Indy as
they

pass the devastated population

CUT TO

39 RXT MAYAPORE VILLAGE - AFTER SUNSET

Black clouds clot across the blood-red sky as darkness falls

Indiana Willie and Short Round sit tensely on a shabby rug

Above their heads there is a thatched roof but there are no

walls

The dying sunset silhouettes them and the half-dozen elders
seat-—

ed in the dirt around them A grey-haired man the village

CHIEFTAIN gives quiet commands to the women who scuttle in and

set wooden plates in front of the three visitors No plates
are

places in front of the elders

WILLIE
(quietly to Indy)
I hope this means were going to
get some dinner

Indiana sees the painted shaman who sits next to the
chieftain

watching Willie The women bring in a bowl from which they
scoop

tiny portions of grey gruel onto three plates

To this the women add a few grains of yellowed rice and a with-

ered molding piece of fruit Willie looks aghast at the
unappe-

tizing combination

WILLIE

(quietly)
God I am starving but I cant
eat this

INDIANA

Thats more food than these people
eat in a week
(pointedly)
Theyre starving too

Willie looks around at the emaciated faces and feels like
crawl-
ing into a hole

WILLIE
Im sorry I -- here please

She picks up her plate and gently hands it back to the women
The chieftain finally speaks to them --

CHIEFTAIN
You will rest here before you go
on

INDIANA

Wed appreciate that This was an
unexpected detour Well have to go
to Delhi now and find a flight west

SHORT ROUND
(smiling)
Indy is taking me to America

All eyes are on Short Round Puzzled by this strange
attention
Shortys smile fades nervously

INDIANA
Im a professor I have to re-
turn to the university Can you
give us a guide to take us to Delhi

The chieftain indicates a young villager sitting near them

CHIEFTAIN
Sanju will guide you

INDIANA
Thank you

The old shaman speaks now for the first time
SHAMAN
On the way to Delhi you will
stop at Pankot

INDIANA
(puzzled)
Pankot isnt on the way to Delhi

SHAMAN
You will go to palace there

INDIANA
Hasnt the Pankot palace been de-
serted since the Mutiny of 1857

SHAMAN

(darkly)
No Now there is new Maharajah --
and palace is powerful again

The shaman looks around at his unfortunate people

SHAMAN (Contd)
t is Pankot Palace that kills my
village

INDIANA
dont understand Whats hap-
pened here

SHAMAN

The evil starts in Pankot Then
like monsoon it moves darkness
over all country

INDIANA
What evil

SHAMAN
They came from Palace and took
sivalinga from out village

Willie looks over at Indiana --

WILLIE
Took what

INDIANA
Its a sacred stone in a shine
thats supposed to protect a
village

SHAMAN
It is why Krishna brought you here

INDIANA
(politely firm)
Nobody brought us here Our plane
crashed We were shot down by --

SHAMAN
(interrupting)
No We pray to Krishna to help us
find the stone It was Krishna who

made you fall from sky -- so you can
got to Pankot Palace To find siva-
linga -- and bring back to us
Indys about to object -- then he looks at the sad chieftain
the
elders and peasants who are watching him helplessly And he
sees
again the dark steady eyes of the old shaman
CUT TO
40 EXT MAYAPORE VILLAGE - NIGHT

Torches falre eerily and dogs howl as the peasants accompany
the

shaman elders and three visitors out ot the edge of the dark
village Short Round walks beside Indy

SHORT ROUND
Indy they make out plane crash
To get you here

INDIANA
Its just superstition Shorty
Like a ghost story

Short Round looks plenty scared as they all stop walking The

shaman motions and the men with torches circle around a pile of

rocks to illuminate them The shaman makes a gesture of
devotion

to the primitive shrine and Indy speaks to the village
chieftain

CHIEFTAIN
Yes

Indiana seems skeptical as he kneels to study the shrine On
top

of the pile of rocks there is a carved niche The niche is

empty but an indentation indicates the conical shape of the
stone

that was stolen

INDIANA
Was the stone very smooth

(he sees the

chieftain nod)
It was probably brought here from
a sacred river

SHAMAN
(joining Indy and
the chieftain)
Long ago -- before my fathers
father

INDIANA

And it had three lines painted
across it
(seeing the

shaman nod)

The lines represent the three
levels of the universe Ive seen
stones like the one you lost

Indy stands slowly Willie is beside him looking at the
shrine

WILLIE
dont understand how losing one
rock could destroy this village
(whispering to Indy)
s it really powerful

Indy gives a doubtful smile He turns again to the old shaman

INDIANA
But why would the Maharajah take
this sacred stone

SHAMAN
They say we must pray to their
evil god We say we will not

The old shaman looks off and fights the tears in his eyes as he
starts speaking in Hindi

INDIANA
(translating)
He says that when the sacred stone
was taken the village wells dried
up first and then the river stopped

Indy turns and asks the shaman a question in Hindi The shaman
answers in Hindi
INDIANA

(translating)
He says their crops dies and then
the animals died

The shaman walks to the edge of the torchlight and looks out
into
the darkness as he continues speaking emotionally in Hindi --

INDIANA
(translating)
And then they took their children

WILLIE
Their children

She looks at Short Round and finally understands the sorrowful
faces always watching him Indy asks another question in Hindi
and the shaman continues his story --

INDIANA

(translating)
He says one night there was a fire
in the fields The men went to
fight it When they came back
they heard the women crying in the
darkness And the children were
gone

The shaman walks slowly toward Indiana

SHAMAN
You will find them when you find
sivlalinga

INDIANA
Im sorry I dont know how I can
help you here

The shaman and the chieftain stare and Indiana refusing to
accept
that

INDIANA (Contd)
The English authorities who con-
trol this area are the only ones
who can help you

CHIEFTAIN
They do not listen

INDIANA
I have friends in Delhi and I will
make sure they investigate this

SHAMAN
No you will got to Pankot

The old man speaks again in his own tongue and Indy looks dis-
turbed

WILLIE
Whatd he say now

INDIANA
It was destined that I came here --
and the future cannot be changed

Indy looks ath the shaman and the torchlight reflected in his
eyes

CUT TO
41 EXT MAYAPORE - NIGHT

Suddenly were rushing headlong down a dark dirt path seen from
the POV of somebody running in terror We hear heavy breathing
-- above we see the scraggly trees blowing against the full
moon
as an eerie wind rises and howls We continue crashing through
the dying fields tward the dark village
42 INT INDIANAS HUT - NIGHT

The wind swirls into the hut and Indianas eyes open He lies
still a moment and then sits up slowly He sees Short Round
sleeping nearby
Sensing something strange Indy gets to his feet He steps
around Short Round and goes to the door of the hut
43 EXT THE HUT - NIGHT

Indy walks against the rising wind and looks around The
village
is asleep and seems deserted Then he turns and sees
something

We follow small bare feet stumbling through the dust
Indy sees an emaciated child in rag running out of the
darkness
Indiana moves forward and the child runs toward him Indy

grabs
the little boy as he falls into his arms
CUT TO
44 INT THE SHAMANS HUT - NIGHT

A few minutes later the little boy is lying unconscious on a

blanket Elders crouch around him Indy is kneeling and
watches

the shaman wet the boys forehead with a rag and drip water

onto

his lips

The little boys eyes open and he begins to revive Shrot
Round

And Willie watch from a corner as the little boy looks at all
the

faces peering down at him

The little boys arm moves and he reaches out to Indy rather
than

any of the others Indy takes his small hand and sees that the

boys fingers are cut and bruised -- his fingers open and drop

something into Indys hand

The little boy tries to whisper Indy has to lean close to
hear

as the little boys lips move again --

LITTLE BOY
Sankara

A mother rushes into the hut now and kneels and hugs her little

boy His skinny arms go around her as they are reunited Indy

stands slowly and looks at what the little boy gave him --

It is a small tattered piece of cloth an old fragment of a
mini-

ature painting Indiana looks at it with an expression of
recog-

nition and apprehension

INDIANA
Sankara

45 EXT THE VILLAGE - MORNING

The camera follows Indiana -- hes walking fast and
determinded-

ly Villagers trot alongside of him trying to keep up with is

pace as he questions thm in Hindi

Indy approaches two large elephants and sees their guide Sajnu
trying to politely drag Willie toward one of them

INDIANA

Damn it Willie get on -- weve
got to move out

Willies head comes up over the back of the elephant as shes

helped from below -- there is a look of sheer terror on her
face
WILLIE
Whoa Easy now -- nice elephant
Waiting by the second elephant Short Round sees Indy coming
and

runs up to him --

SHORT ROUND
I ride with you Indy

INDIANA
Nope you got a little surprise
over there Shorty

Short Round runs around the big elephant and sees a baby
elephant
being brought out He cant believe his luck --

SHORT ROUND

Oh boy
Meanwhile Sajnu goads Willies elephant over The villagers
look
grief stricken and many are crying as they watch the three
stran-

gers departure

WILLIE
(to Short Round)
This is the first time anybody
ever cried when I left

SHORT ROUND
They dont cry about you They
cry about the elephants leaving
and

WILLIE
Figures

SHORT ROUND
They got no food to feed them So

sell them

Indy lumbers over on his elephant
INDIANA
All right lets go I want to get

to Pankot before tomorrow night

She looks at Indiana as he rides past

WILLIE
Pankot I thought we were going
to Delhi Hey wait a minute
(looking at

the villagers)
Cant somebody take me to Delhi
I dont want to go to Pankot

Sajnu guides her elephant and Willie lurches forward --
WILLIE (Contd)
(yelling)
Indiana Damn it Whyd you
change your mind What did that
kid tell you last night

Indy ignores her hollering The elephants move off through the
crowds of pitiful villagers Indy sees the elders chieftain

the old shaman who brings his hands up to his forehead as Indy
rides past

WILLIE

I think you need this more than

Willie leans forward and puts perfume behind the elephants
Grimacing at the animals smell she simply dumps the rest of

perfume on the elephants back

Willie yelps when the elephants trunk comes back sniffs the
foriegn fragrance and suddenly trumpets in disgust

WILLIE (Contd)
Whatre you complaining about
this is expensive stuff

CUT TO

EXT LOWER JUNGLES - DAY

From a cliff we see the elephants below passing into the lower
jungles

Spotting something on an overhanging tree branck Short Round
stands up precariously on the baby elephants back He pulls a
vine from the tree as they pass under it Plopping down onto

baby elephants back he picks the wild fruit from the vine --

SHORT ROUND
Here you go lunch time

The baby elephants trunk comes back and takes the fruit
looks up in the sky

SHORT ROUND (Contd)

Indiana and Willie look up and see hundreds of enormous winged
creatures flapping across the afternoon sky

WILLIE
Those are very big bird

Sajnu says something and Indiana nods

The three elephants stand sucking up river water with their
trunks Seated on the huge beasts Willie Short Round and
ana watch the thirsty animals
WILLIE
They must be pretty dumb to drink

In response Willies elephant calmly lifts its trunk and

her in the face Short Round and Indy laugh as Willie sits
soaked and shocked

INDIANA
I think maybe well camp here

EXT THE RIVER - SUNSET

A plume of water sprays The three elephants submerge ina
wide spot in the river Indy wades in the current with his

EXT UPRIVER

Thirty yards upstream birds and monkeys chatter in a tree In
the shady river beneath Willie surfaces cooly and wipes hair

from her eyes She hums contendedly

Indiana wanders up the riverbank in his dripping trousers He
notices Willies wet clothes spread over a tree limb hanging

over the water and then he sees Willie paddling around

INDIANA
Hey Willie -- I think you better
get out now

WILLIE
Stark naked You wish If youre

trying to seduce me Dr Jones
this is a very primitive approach

INDIANA
Me seduce you Honey youre the
one who took your clothes off
(shrugging)
I just came over to remind you
that you never know what else
might be in the water

WILLIE
Somehow I feel safer in here

As Indy turns and starts off Willie reaches up to the tree
branch above her head and grabs her underwear At this moment

notice something awful

A BOA CONSTRICTOR is moving out along the branch the enormous
snake slithering over Willies clothes

Willie watches Indiana walk away as she reaches up for her
-- her hands feel something strange -- not the dress and not
tree limb --

Willie looks up and sees that shes pulling on a snake She
SCREAMS as the boa constrictor falls off the t-ee on top of
Indy hears the scream and hears Willie calling to him He runs
back toward the river Stopping on the riverbank he sees

Willie

backing away in the water -- Indianas already starting to pull
his boots off --

WILLIE
Indy Help me

INDIANA
Dont worry Im coming in What
is it

WILLIE
A snake

Suddenly Indiana freezes and a strange look corsses his face --

He finally sees
close

INDIANA
A what

WILLIE
A SNAKE

the boa constrictor thrashing in the water

to Willie He leaves his boots on

Willie suddenly
arm --

Indy runs along

WILLIE (Contd)
Hurry help me out of here
Whatre you waiting for

INDIANA
Uh listen -- Willie -- I gota
better idea
WILLIE
What
INDIANA
First of all -- dont panic

screams as the boa constrictor wraps around her

WILLIE
Its got me Indy help me

the riverbank trying to get closer to her but

not about to jump into the river (due to his aversion to snakes
-- see Episode One Raiders of the Lost Ark)
INDIANA
Dont let it pull you deeper

WILLIE
Its pulling me deeper

INDIANA
Dont let it curl around you

WILLIE
Its curling around me Damn it
stop talking and do something

The snake is wrapping around her body and neck -- her head is
barely above water --

On the riverbank Indy reaches down and grabs a piece of wood
But as he watches the repulsive reptile he starts to sweat and
his fear and loathing overpower him --

WILLIE (Contd)
Whats wrong Indy please help

me
Indy groans and bolsters his courage -- he takes two steps into
the water -- but the complex is to strong and he cant go any

further He drops the piece of wood

INDIANA
Listen Willie Do exactly what
I tell you now

WILLIE
What

INDIANA
Can you move your arm

WILLIE
Just one arm

INDIANA
Okay I want you to lift your hand --
and pet the snake

WILLIE
PET IT

INDIANA
Yes stroke it right along the
maxillary and precaudal verte-
brae
WILLIE

THE WHAT

INDIANA
Pet it on the head Go on pet
it

In the water Willie is whimpering as she lifts her hand and
starts petting the snake coiling around her pale body

WILLIE
Oh -- my -- god -- its going to
crush me

INDIANA

Keep stroking it

Willie keeps rubbing her hand along the snakes head and back

and
it slowly stops thrashing in the water
INDIANA (Contd)
Whats happening
WILLIE
Its starting to let go
INDIANA
Thats good -- youre doing fine
Grimacing as she stares at the ugly serpents head Willie
keeps
stroking it
WILLIE
Its letting fo I think its --
I think its going to sleep
Indiana looks relieved He sees the snake starting to drift
away
from Willie and she starts paddling back to shore collecting
her
floating clothes along the way
Holding her dripping dress against herself she walks out of
the

water toward Indy who smiles at her weakly

INDIANA
See -- I got you out
She slows and hauls off and punches him in the mouth Indy

holds
his jaw as she walks away infuriates
WILLIE
Thanks for nothing I hate snakes
INDIANA
(looking at
the water)
I know the feeling

53 EXT THE CAMPSITE - NIGHT

By firelight we see Sajnu feeding the big elephants while
Short

Round feeds and talks to the baby elephant --

SHORT ROUND
You come to America with me and
we can get job in the circus --
you like that

The baby elephant trumpets affirmitively
A ways off Willie stands wrapped in a blanket watching Shorty

and the elephant as she dries her hair by a campfire Now Indy
comes up and drops an armload of wood for yet another fire

WILLIE
Whered you find your little body-
guard

INDIANA

I met Short Round when he tried
to pick my pocket

Indiana kneels and arranges the wood

INDIANA (Contd)
Shortys family was killed when
they bombed Shanghai He was
living on the streets

WILLIE
(smiling)

Hell be okay Hes a good kid

Indy strikes a match and lights the new fire
WILLIE (Contd)
All these fires -- you expecting
more snakes Dr Jones

She smiles snidely and continues drying her hair

Indy picks up a

INDIANA
By the way howd you end up in
Shanghai

WILLIE
Well when my nightclub career was
run over by the Depression some
pinhead convinced me that a girl
could go places in the Orient
So look where I got

INDIANA
What about the future

WILLIE
Oh thats easy -- Im going to
latch onto a good-looking in-
credibly rich prince

Indy lies down on the blanket

INDIANA
Id like to find one of those
myself

WILLIE
(raising an eyebrow)
Oh really

Yeah but hes got to be dead and

buried for a couple of thousand years

INDIANA
Maybe

Indy reaches into his pocket and removes the old piece of

She walks over to where hes lying down
He hands her the cloth and she looks at

WILLIE
Whats that

INDIANA
Something that kid gave me last
night Its a piece of an old
manuscript

Willie sees a crude drawing in reds blue and gold

INDIANA (Contd)
The drawing shows a priest named
Sankara who lived centuries ago

WILLIE
What does the writing say

INDIANA
Its Sanskrit It tells the story
of Sankara climbing Mt Kalisa
where he met the Hindu god Shiva

WILLIE
(examining it)
Thats Shiva Whats he giving
the Priest

INDIANA
Legend says he told Sankara to go
forth and combat evil To do that
he gave him five sacred stones that
had magical powers

WILLIE

(looking at Indy)
You mean magical like the rock that
was stolen from that village

Indy looks at her meaningfully

Willie seems frightened

stands up

She picks up a blanket and starts off

INDIANA
think you should sleep closer
(seeing her sus-
picious look)
meant for safety

WILLIE
(smiling)
d be safer sleeping with
that snake

She steps over to a tree by the fire where her clothes are dry-
ing Indy watches her pull her dried clothes from the lower
branches

She reaches up to remove another piece of her clothing -- its
stuck to the tree and she looks up and yanks it Suddenly the
piece of clothing moves

Two enormous winds open and the hideous face of a GIANT BAT
screeches and hisses at Willie She screams hysterically as

bat flaps against her biting and scratching at her before it
nally takes off

The bat flies off into the darkness and Indy chuckles as he
watches Willie shanking as she backs slowly toward the fire --

WILLIE
Did you see it It was one
of those bats
(staring into
the darkness)
God what else is out there

She quickly picks up her blanket and lays it out very close to
Indy

INDIANA
Couldnt keep away huh

WILLIE
Just try and control yourself
Indiana watches her lie down and wrap herself in her blanket
then he rolls over and tips his hat down over his eyes to get
some well-deserved shut-eye

In a moment however we see something grotesque and snake-like
slide into frame and move towards Indy -- finally we realize
its an elephants trunk The trunk nudges Indys shoulder

INDIANA
(without looking)
Still scared Okay Willie you
can get closer if you want

The elephants trunk moves closer and nuzzles Indys neck
INDIANA
Honey I knew youd be the first

one to give in

Now we see that Short Round is guiding the baby elephants

trunk
with a prod Willie watches stifling a laugh as the
elephants
trunk sniffs Indianas ear --
INDIANA (Contd)
Youre going to start something
Im going to have to finish
(moaning)
Okay doll you asked for it
Indiana rolls over lifts his hat and hollers He nearly jumps
out of his pants as he stares into the elephants trunk
Willie
and Short Round dissolve into laughter

EXT A JUNGLE CLEARING - LATER

Their Mayapore guide walks toward the camera and suddenly looks
frightened He barks commands and the elephants stop Indiana
jumps down an joins the fearful guide

They stare at a small statue of a malevolent goddess with eight
arms Around the goddesss neck a carved necklace displays
small human heads -- her eight hands hold other heads by their
hair

Indiana moves closer to the statue as the terrified guide backs
away Indy is fascinated by the ritual objects adorning it
leaves dead birds rodents and turtles Indiana grimaces as

lifts a necklace of real pierced human fingers

WILLIE (0S)
Why are we stopping here

Indiana goes back and joins the scared jabbering guide who is
helping Willie down from the elephant Short Round jumps down

SHORT ROUND
What you look at Indy

INDIANA
Just a statue

WILLIE
Whats the guide talking about
He hasnt said a word the whole
trip
Indy listens to the agitated guide and then speaks a few words
Hindi back to him They watch the distressed guide trun the

phants and start away with them as fast as possible

WILLIE
Hes afraid of something
INDIANA
He said he couldnt take us any
farther He has to go sell the
elephants

WILLIE
You mean we have to walk the rest
of the way

Willie moans and follows Indy Short Round watches the

elephants

EXT A PALACE APPROACH - AFTERNOON

Indiana and Short Round hike up a rock-paved road beside a high
wall Exhausted carrying her high heels Willie trudges along
behind them

WILLIE
-- shot at fallen out of a plane
nearly drowned squashed by a snake
attacked by a bat -- I smell like
an elephant
(yelling)
I tell you Im not going to make it

Indiana finally stops He walks back to Willie suddenly picks
her us in his arms and starts carrying her the remaining way
Willie is surprised and puzzled

INDIANA
Any more complaints

WILLIE
(smiling faintly)
Yeah I wish youd thought of this
sooner

She doesnt seem to mind being carried by Indy He arrives at
the entrance to the palace and puts her down -- she stands

to him and he gently smoothes the collar of her dress

INDIANA
It doesnt feel like theres been
any permanent damage
as

Princel

She smiles at him again and then turns around -- and whistles
she sees Pankot Palace a sprawling monumental mixture of Mo-
ghul and Rajput styles the palace is an extravaganza of

y

architecture

EXT A BRIDGE

The three travelers start across a marble bridge toward the

entrance Lined along the bridge palace guards stand with
lances

As the threesome passes the first Rajput guard snaps noisily
attention and Willie jumps As Willie continues across the
bridge the other guards snap to attention in sequence and she

grins enjoying the attention

INT THE OUTER COURTYARD

Short Round and Willie follow Indiana through a dark archway

a glittering courtyard The palace seems deserted and forebod-
ing

INDIANA
Hello(hello) (hello)
Indys voice echoes off the marble facades -- three enormous

put guards with curved swords in their sashes appear silently
opposite sides of the courtyard
WILLIE
(frightened)

Hi (hi) (hi)
Then a tall severe-looking Indian in an English suit material-
izes out of the shadows and comes forward slowly CHATTAR LAL
appraises the intruders suspiciously

He sees a whoozy beauty in a weary evening gown a dirty

kid with a baseball cap a rugged-looking American carrying a
bullwhip
CHATTAR LAL
I would say you look rather lost
(disdainfullt)
But then I cannot imagine where
in the world the three of you
would look at home

INDIANA
(smiling evenly)
Lost No were not lost Were
on our way to Delhi This is Miss
Scott -- and Mr Round My names

CHATTAR LAL

(surprised)
Dr Jones The eminent archae-
ologist

WILLIE
Hard to believe isnt it

CHATTAR LAL
I remember first hearing your name
when I was studying at Oxford I

His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot

He bows and Willie sort of curtsies

CHATTAR LAL (Contd)
Welcome to Pankot Palace

59 INT PANKOT PALACE - AFTERNOON

They walk along the marble halls past dazzling walls inlaid
with

pieces of mirror and semi-precious stones Fountains spray in

ivory countyards and they gaze in awe at the ornate splendour

As Willie walks with Shorty she appraises the chronolgoical
portraits of the Pankot Prices that line the hall Dissipated
faces elegant faces evil faces -- she reacts to them

WILLIE
(to Short Round)
Howd you like to run into him in
a dark alleythat ones kind of
cuteI could see myself married
to a prince like that
Ahead of them Chattar Lal walks with Indy and questions him
suspiciously --

CHATTAR LAL
The plane crash and your journey
here sound -- most incredible

WILLIE
You should have been there

INDIANA
Wed appreciate it if the Mahara-
jah would let us stay tonight
Well be on out way in the morn-
ing

CHATTAR LAL
I am only his humble servant but
the Maharajah usually listens to
my advice

WILLIE
Is that him

Theyve come to the last in the row of Princes portraits Wil-
lie stops and looks up disappointedly at a picture of an aged
immensely corpulent Rajput prince

WILLIE (Contd)
(politely)
Hes not exactly what we call
a spring chicken

CHATTAR LAL
No no that is Uhmed Singh the
present Maharajahs late father

WILLIE
Oh -- good And maybe the pres-
ent Marahajah is a little younger
And thinner

Two female servants approach silently and bow

CHATTAR LAL
They will escort you to your rooms
now You will be provided with
fresh clothes Tonight you will
be dining with His Highness

WILLIE
Dinner And with a prince My
luck is changing But look at
me -- my god Ive to to get
ready

She hurried off with one of the servants toward her room

Chat-
tar Lal smiles cooly at Indiana --
CHATTAR LAL
Eight oclock in the Pleasure
Pavilion
CUT TO
60 EXT THE PLEASURE PALIVION - NIGHT

An extraordinary gold dome rises in the middle of the
eleaborate
gardens The Pleasure Pavilion is ablaze with torch lights
flickering candles and exotic music
Indiana comes out of the palace with Short Round Indy has on
a
tweed jacket and a nectie -- his university professors outfit
Short Round has been cleaned up but still sports his baseball
cap
Willie joins them looking stunning is a silk Western-styled
gown Shes also been loaned some Moghul jewelry which
sparkles
on her neck and arms
INDIANA
You look like a princess
Willies flattered by the first nice thing Indys said to her
WILLIE
Its sort of like being in heaven
They cross the garden toward the pavilion and Willies eyes are
like a kids at Christmas
61 INT THE PLEASURE PAVILION

As they enter Indiana gives a half-dressed dancing girl the
once-over as she spins to the music of drums and vinhas

INDIANA
(smiling)
Ive always had a weakness for
folk dancing

WILLIE

(snidely)
She might get away with that act
here but shed never make it in
a real nightclub

They walk among the rich court ministers and Indian merchants
Chattar Lal approaches with a British cavalry captain in
unifrom

CHATTAR LAL
We are fortunate tonight to have
some many unexpected guests his
is Captain Phillip Blumburtt

Blumburtt bows to Willie and Indiana

CHATTAR LAL (Contd)
Captain Blumburtt and his troops
are here to check up on the
natives

CAPT BLUMBURTT
(politely)
Just a routine inspection tour

CHATTAR LAL
The British worry so about their
Emprie -- it makes us feel like
well-cared-for children

WILLIE
Listen Mr Lal what do you call
the Maharajahs wife

CHATTAR LAL
His Highness has not yet taken a
wife

WILLIE

(happily)
No Well I guess he just hasnt
met the right woman

As Willie chatters on with the Prime Minister Indiana wanders
off He moves to a wall where bronze statues and strange devo-
tional objects are displayed

CAPT BLUMBURTT
(joining Indy)
Interested in local curios

INDIANA
No But I am interested in the
occult And this is a krtya

Indiana picks up a small clay figurine and examines it

CAPT BLUMBURTT
(grimacing)
Charming

INDIANA
Its like the voodoo dolls of West
Africa The kryta represents your
enemy -- and gives you complete
power over him

CAPT BLUMBURTT
That God all that mumbo jumbo
rubbish is disappearing

INDIANA
You think so

CAPT BLUMBURTT
Of course Admittedly its taken
time Britians controlled India
for almost two hundred eyars now

Indiana smiles at the somewhat pompous bureaucrat

INDIANA
Youre hanging on better here
than you did in America

CAPT BLUMBURTT
(smiling sourly)
This is a different situation Dr
Jones These people are like
children We have to lead them
slowly into the twentieth century

Indiana puts the doll down and looks over at Chattar Lal and
Willie

INDIANA
The Prime Minister doesnt seem
that naive

CAPT BLUMBURTT
No hes a very shrewd old boy
Power behind the throne and all
that He actually runs this whole
province

Indy and the Prime Minister exchange distant looks as Willie
comes back over to Indiana She talks to him conspiratorially

WILLIE
I think this Maharajah is swim-
ming in money Maybe coming here
wasnt such a bad idea

Blumburtt finds these Americans quite suspect and seems
relieved
when he hears a drum

CAPT BLUMBURTT
I believe were being called to
dinner

WILLIE
Finally

As the drum beats the assembled guests move toward a long low
table surrounded by colorful pillows Short Round follows with

a
little monkey hes found perched on his arm
As everyone stands around the table Chattar Lal makes an an-
nouncement in Hindi and then in English --
CHATTAR LAL
His Supremem Highness guardian of
Rajput tradition -- the Maharajah
of Pankot -- Zalim Singh
All eyes are on two solid silver doors which open -- and
through

which now walks the MAHARAJAH ZALIM SINGH Everyone is bowing
including Indiana and Willie who looks amazed --

WILLIE
Thats the Maharajah -- that kid

INDIANA
Maybe he likes older women

Indeed Zalim Singh is only thirteen Outfitted in silver and
gold brocade festooned with enormous jewels the litlle
Mahara-
amaze-

pierc-

around

Maha-

to

jah gazes imperiously at the bowing crowd -- and then glares at
Short Round

Indy sees Short Round chewing gum staring antagonistically at
the Maharajah Indy pushes SHort Round into a bowing position

The Maharajah finally sits down on golden pillows He nods and
his guests take their seats Indiana sees Willies dreams of
queendom have vanished

INDIANA
Cheer up you lost your prince
but dinners on the way

WILLIE
Ive never been so hungry in my
life

Servants appear with silver platters of steaming food They
place a platter in front of Willie and she stares at it in

ment
Its a whole raosted boar replete with a decorative arrow
ing its bloated stomach and tiny broiled baby bores placed
it as if they were suckling on their well-cooked mother
WILLIE
(grimacing)
My god sort of grusome isnt

it

Seeing the meat being served Indiana looks across the table at
Blumburtt who seems equally puzzled Meanwhile the little

rajah whispers to his Prime Minsiter Then Chattar Lal speaks
the table --
CHATTAR LAL
His Highness wants me to welcome
his visitors Especially the
renowned Dr Jones from America

Indy bows slightly toward the Maharajah

INDIANA
We are honored to be here
monkey

Servants put down another platter Willie stares at an
enormous
steaming boa constrictor on the platter With a flash of a
knife a servant slits the huge snake and exposes a mass of
squirming live baby eels inside

WILLIE

Suddenly Im not so hungry

Meanwhile Indiana is chatting poleitely with the Prime
Minister

INDIANA

I had a question Mr Prime Mini-
ster I was examining some of the
Maharajahs artifacts

CHATTAR LAL

A very fine collection of very old
pieces dont you think

INDIANA

Yes very fine But not all of the
pieces look old Some were carved
recently and look like images used
by the Thuggees to worship the god-

des Kali

At the emntion of the Thuggees the Indians at the table quiet
as it a taboo has been broken Chattar Lal glares at Indiana

Dr Jones

CHATTAR LAL
you know very well that

the Thuggee cult has been dead for

nearly a century

Of course

CAPT BLUMBURTT
The Thuggees were an

obscenity that worshipped Kali
with human sacrifices The Brit-
ish Army wiped them out about the
time of the Mutiny of 1857

Short Round avoids the dinner by feeding it to his little

as he listens to the scary conversation

The talk is bad enough but Willie finds the food unbelievable
A servant leans overher shoulder and places a six-inch long BUG

on her plate

Willie whimpers quietly as she watches the fat merchant next to
her lift one of the black shiny baked-beetles -- and crack
in

two The man proceeds to enthusiastically suck the gooey
innards

out

MERCHANT
(looking at Willie)
But youre not eating

WILLIE
(weakly)
I uh -- had bugs for lunch

Meanwhile Indiana continues to politely needle Chattar Lal

INDIANA
I suppose stories of the Thuggees
die hard

CHATTAR LAL
There are no stories anymore

INDIANA
Well I dont know we came here
from a small village and the peas-—
ants there told us that the Pankot
Palace was growing powerful again
-- becuase of some ancient evil

Indiana smiles and shrugs

CHATTAR LAL

(sneeringly)
Their stories are just fear and
folklore

INDIANA

(cooly)

Maybe but how do you explain
The Thuggee shrine I saw right
below the palace

Indy catches a glance between the little Maharajah and the
prime
minister who answers slowly --

CHATTAR LAL
The local peasants are just as
superstitious Youre very ob-
servant Dr Jones But youre
beginning to worry Capt Blum-
burtt
Blumburtts phlegmatic attitude has changed to curiosity

CAPT BLUMBURTT
Im not worried Prime Minister
just interested

During their conversation Willie listens to beetles SNAPPING
and

she watches revolted as the other dinner guests suck the gooey

insides out of the bugs

WILLIE
(to Short Round)
Give me your hat

SHORT ROUND
What for

WILLIE
Im going to puke in it

Meanwhile Indy continues ingenously with Chattar Lal

INDIANA
You know the villagers also
claimed that this palace stole
something from them

CHATTAR LAL
Dr Jones it our country a guest
does not usually insult his host

INDIANA
Sorry I thought we were just talking
about folklore

CAPT BLUMBURTT
(trying to make peace)
Im sure its nothing Just ru-
mors
(but interested)
What was it they claimed was
stolen

INDIANA
Something magical A sacred rock

CHATTAR LAL
(condescendingly)
There you see Captain A rock
INDIANA
When they lost this rock their
fields and animals dies They
also said their children were
taken from them

CHATTAR LAL
I think thats enough of this

nonsense Dr Jones

Indiana smiles faintly at Chattar Lals anger Across the

table
Willie looks pale and motions to the waiter
WILLIE
So you have something you know
simple -- like soup or something
The servant goes off and returns with a covered bowl He
uncov-
ers it and Willie looks at a soup with a dozen eyeballs
floating

in it

MERCHANT
Looks delicious

WILLIE
I wanna go home

Willie whimpers and tears start down her cheeks

INDIANA
(to Chattar Lal)
I was dubious muself at first
Then something connected -- the
villages rock and the old legend
of the Sankara Stones

CHATTAR LAL
(controlling himself)
Dr Jones we are all vulnerable
to vicious rumors I seem to re-
member that in Honduras you were
accused of being a grave robber
rather than a scientist

INDIANA
(shrugging)
The newspapers exaggerated the
incident
CHATTAR LAL
And didnt the Sultan of Madagas-
car threaten to cut your head off
if you ever returned to his coun-
try

INDIANA
That was a misunderstanding

CHATTAR LAL

(smiling)
Exactly what we have here Dr
Jones

MAHARAJAH

I have heard the terrible stories
of the evil Thuggee cult

When the little Marahajah speaks it surprises everyone and
there
is silence

MAHARAJAH (Contd)
I thought the stories were told
to frighten children Later I
learned that the Thuggee cult was
once real and did unspeakable
things

The Marahajah looks at Indiana

MAHARAJAH (Contd)
I am ashamed of what happened here
so many years ago We keep these

objects -- to remind us that this
will never again happen in my
kingdom

INDIANA

(after a moment)
Im sorry if Ive offended you

Now more trays are whisked in by servants

MERCHANT
Ah dessert

Short Rounds monkey suddenly screeches and takes off Willie
closed here eyes in dread - but curiosity gets the best of her
and she looks -- its worse than she could imagine
Plates full of small dead monkey heads (Production note

be-

cause of his extremely sensitive nature the director has
reque-

ted that these monkey heads be simulated)

The tops of the monkeys skulls have been cut off and sit loose

like little covers Willie watches in utter dismay as the
Maha-

rajah and his guests remove the skull-tops and start dipping

spoons into whats inside --

MERCHANT (Contd)
Chilled monkey brains
Willie keels over crashing backwards in a dead faint
CuT TO

62 INT A PALACE HALL - LATER

Women servants help a woobly-kneed Willie toward her room
63 EXT THE PELASURE GARDEN - NIGHT

Hundreds of lanters illuminate the garden where after dinner
drinks are served cigars lighted and hookah pipes puffed on

Indiana comes out of the pavilion into the garden with Capt
Blumburtt and they talk quietly

CAPT BLUMBURTT
Rather bizarre menu woundnt you
say

INDIANA
Even if they were trying to scare
us away a devout Hindu would
never touch meat
(looking around)
Makes you wonder what these people
are

Now the little Maharajah comes over with his retinue and he
reaches for Indys whip which Short Round is carrying

MAHARAJAH
I have seen this thing What is
it Dr Jones
SHORT ROUND
Hey nobody touches Indys whip

Short Round grabs for it but Indiana restrains him

INDIANA
Were guests here Shorty

The Maharajah glares are Short Round and five the whip to Indy

MAHARAJAH
You will show me how it works
please

Indy bows to the little prince and smiles ironically --
INDIANA
You wish is my command your

Highness

While Short Round watches angrily Indiana walks across the

gar-
den and unfurls the whip Indy sees a servant lighting a
candle
Suddenly the whip flies and CRACKS like a pistol shot The
candle disappears Indiana whirls and CRACKS the whip again
snagging a flower out of a dancing girls hair
The Maharajah reacts like any kid -- he shoops happily
MAHARAJAH
That is wonderful Please teach
me how
Short Round sulks as he listens to Indiana instructing the
Maha-
rajah on how to hold the whip As the young prince practises
the
grip Indy notices Chattar Lal slip behind a fountain to talk
to

a dark figure in robes who appears

Indiana sees Chattar Lal bow to the dark figure -- and Indy
catches a glimpse of the strangers pale face and dark hollow
eyes Then the robled apparition seems to disappear

Meanwhile everyone watches respectfully as the Maharajah
unfurls

the whip for his first attempt He flings the whip but it
flies

back and snaps -- biting his own cheek
Theres a stunned silence -- then Short Round laughs at the
little prince who is holding his wounded cheek The incensed

Ma-
rahajah suddenly flashes the whip as Short Round
Short Round grabs the end of it and pulls hard -- the whip is
tugged taut between the two hostile boys As they draw near
each

other Short Round sees something weird

The little Maharajahs eyes begin glowing yelloe and he hisses

softly in a strange voice Nobody else sees or hears the
bizarre

transformation

Indiana finally intercedes -- he grabs Short Round by the neck

INDIANA
Okay Short Round let go of it

Short Round lets go and Indy gently takes the whip back from

the
little prince
INDIANA (Contd)
The Turks say that a whip can be
an enemy even to its owner If
you get some rope itll be easier
to learn with your Highness
Now I think well say goodnight
The Maharajah and Short Round stare hostiley at each other as
Indy recoils his whip
CUT TO
64 INT A PALACE HALL - NIGHT

Short Round walks beside Indiana down the shadowy hall toward
their room Short Round has Indys whip curled around his
shoul-

der The little fellow yawns and shakes his head

SHORT ROUND
That little Maharajah think he
big stuff

INDIANA
You dont like him do you
SHORT ROUND
Next time I flatten him Did you
see his eyes

INDIANA
No

SHORT ROUND
Indy they glow like fire and get
real crazy Then he talk in this
real scary voice

Indy tousles Short Rounds hair

INDIANA
He was afraid of you He knows a
tough guy when he sees one

SHORT ROUND
(not so shure)
Yeah thats what happened

They reach their room and Short Round opens the door

INDIANA
I better see how Willie is

Short Round shakes his head scornfully as Indy crosses the hall
and knocks on another door After a moment the door opens and
Willie is standing there in a tempting nightgown

INDIANA
I brought you something

He holds up something wrapped in a piece of silk
WILLIE

(disgusted)
Not leftovers

INDIANA
No -- real food
Willie opens the bundle suspiciously -- then her hace lights up

as she examines the breads and fruits inside

WILLIE
Oh it is real foodits
beautiful
She bites happily into a piece of fruit -- its juice runs down

her chin and Indy wipes it off gently with his hand The mouth
deliberately seductive and Willie is not displeased

WILLIE (Contd)
Youre nice Listen Im taking
applications -- howd you like to
be my palace slave

INDIANA
(smiling)
Wearing your jewels to be prin-
cess
Indy touches her necklace -- then his hand caresses her neck

and
ear She shivers slightly and speaks softly

WILLIE

Yeah -- and nothing else
(smiling)

That shock you

INDIANA
(shaking his head)
Im a scientist I like doing
research on certain nocturnal
activities --

She smiles and puts a grape to his lips He opens his mouth
takes it and chews it

WILLIE
You mean like love rituals

He swallows the grape and they move toward each other slowly to
kiss revealing the passion thats simmering

INDIANA
And mating customs

They kiss again more heatedly

WILLIE
Primitive sexual practices

INDIANA
Youre taling to an authority
in that area

They kiss again hungrily --

WILLIE
Youre dying to come into my room
arent you

INDIANA
You want me so bad why dont you
invite me

WILLIE
Too proud to admit youre crazy
about me Dr Jones

INDIANA
I think youre too used to get-
ting you own way Willie

They kiss yet again -- and Indy breaks it off just to show
hes
still in control He backs away toward his room
WILLIE
(watching him)
Well see who gives in first --
Ill leave my door open
INDIANA
Dont catch cold
WILLIE
Dr Jones --
Indy stops by his door and sees Willie smiling as she holds up
five fingers --
WILLIE (Contd)
Five minutes youll be back
over here in five minutes
INDIANA
Youre dreaming Willie You want
to make it real just knock on my
door
He winks She waves But neither one will surrender first
Willie does into her room leaving the door ajar Indy opens
his
door
65 INT INDIANAS SUITE

Indy comes in and closes the door -- leaving it open a crack
He

stands and listens waiting for her to come over

INT WILLIES SUITE

Willie stands likewise by her door waiting to hear Indy come
back over
67 INT INDIANAS SUITE

Indiana shrugs and walks over to a couch and starts taking off
his tweed jacket and necktie --
INDIANA
Five minutes fat chance
68 INT WILLIE SUIT

Willie moves around her lavish suite turning down lights
creating
a romantic effect checking herself in a mirror --
WILLIE
(confidently)
Five minutes Dr Jones
69 INT INDIANAS SUITE

Indy undresses in the magnificently decorated room wall
paint-
ings show palace scenes and landscapes life-size figures
dance and there are full-scale portraits or Rajput princes and
prancing horses But Indys more concerned with lust than with
art
INDIANA
(muttering)
want me to be her palace slave
He picks up his whip and smiles considering using it on her
Then he just grubles and tosses the bullwhip onto the couch
70 INT WILLIES SUITE

Lying in bed in a seductive pose Willie waits for Indy to show
up and she starts to look worried She grabs a clock and
shakes

it to see if its working She taps her fingers irritably won-
dering in her charm has failed

INT INDIANAS SUITE

We see another clock ticking Looking annoyed Indy tosses a
boot at it and the clock falls on its face setting of the
alarm
On the chaise lounge in front of Indys bed Short Round moves
groggily and sees Indy turning off the alarm
SHORT ROUND
(half asleep)
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up
and keep eye on things
INDIANA
Okay Shorty see you in the
morningIm going to have a
little -- word with Willie
Indy finally shakes his head and gives in to his animal
instincts He buttons his shirt puts his boots back on and
grabs his leather jacket
As he puts on his jacket he walks past the life-sized paintings
of
armed gaurds standing in silent vigil Suddenly we see
something
frightening behind him one of the wall paintings sees to come
to life
A large figure in robes and a turban looms out from the wall
and
lifts a silk cord -- the figure wraps the cord suddenly around
Indianas neck
The huge assassin stands behind Indy twisting the cord even
tighter around his neck As Indy attempts to break free he
sees the assassins face is a mirror -- and a strange yellow
light glowing in the killers eyes
72 INT WILLIES SUITE

Willies finally had enough waiting and she gets out of beg
petu-

lantly

WILLIE
Hes not comingI cant be-
lieve it
She walks across the room and opens the door She looks out
the empty hall -- and her resolve starts to weaken --

WILLIE (Contd)
Well
(bracing herself)
No Im not going over there

She comes back into her room and kicks the door closed

WILLIE (Contd)
Sleep tight Dr Jones
(suddenly melancholy)
I couldve been your greatest ad-

venture

73 INT INDIANAS SUITE

Indy shoves the assassin backwards ramming the big man into
the

wall The assassin maintains his deathgrip -- while on the

chaise Short Round sleeps through it all

Gasping futilely for air Indy sinks slowly to his knees - his

eyes bulge and he stares at the tiny smiling skulls at the
ends

of the death-cord wrapped around the assassins fists

Indiana sinks lower and then feels something -- desperately he

grabs a brass pot on the floor by the handle and swings it with

his last strength smashing it up into the assassins head with

a skull-crushing clang

The assassin is stunned and Indiana curls forward pulling him

into a somersault and sening him flying over his back The
ass-

assin crashes on his sping next to the chaise Short Round
still

doesnt wake up

Indiana rips the cord from around his neck and gasps for
breath

He sees the assassin pulling a knife Indiana dives as the
knife

flies through the air and slams into the wall

Indiana grabs his whip rolls and lands on his feet As the
ass-

assin tries to retreat Indy unleashes his whip -- it CRACKS
and
it

in-

wraps around the killers neck
The big man struggles pulling on the whip trying to release

from his throat -- and Indiana holds fast watching the killer
gasping for air now as his face turns red

Suddenly the assassin does a full-blown backward sommersault
which rips the whip out of Indys hand The assassin has an

stant to grin victoriously --

Until he sees that the whip handle is arching toward the

ceiling

assass-—

and

up

fan

where is gets caught on the revolving fan The surprised

in it tugged upwards -- and the whip twists around the ceiling
fan like fishing-line around a fishing-reel--

And like a doomed flounder the assassin is slowly reeled up

dragged toward the ceiling his toes lifting off the floor
The assassin screams as he is hanged His legs twitch in
his death throes -- and below him Short Round finally wakes

Always Indianas protector Shorty instictively leaps off the
couch and draws a small dagger --

SHORT ROUND
Dont worry Indy Where are
they

Short Round spins a 360 then looks up and does a double-take
seeing the dead assassin twisting slowly around the ceiling

Indy takes Short Rund by the shoulders and turns him away from
the grisly sight

INDIANA
Its okay its over -- go turn
off the fan
Short goes over and turns off the fan -- the assassins body

drops and Indy recoils his whip Suddenly they hear a hideous
scream -- Willie

INT WILLIES SUITE

In a tight close-up Willie screams again Shes lying in bed
looking down at something --
Moving up her shapely leg a green and black monstrous-looking
insect crawls onto her stomach and Willie stops breather
Immo-
bilized by fear Willie watches in silent agony as the hideous
insect climbs slowly up her breast and slithers toward her
neck

Across the suite the doors burst open and Indiana rushes in
Shorty is behind him carrying Indys whip Indiana leaps on a
stools and slides up to the bed to save WIllie --

Then he spots the giant insect crawling on her and decides to
have some fun

INDIANA
This a cheap trick to get me over

here

Willie speaks with desperate fearful precision --

WILLIE

No -- dont you see -- crawling --
INDIANA

What -- the bug

Willie is petrified and shaking

WILLIE
Get -- the -- bug -- off

INDIANA
Gee I wouldnt want to touch an
ugly critter like that

SHORT ROUND
(grinning)
Uh uh -- me neither

Willie looks at the man-of-action like hes insane Then she
feels the bug crawling onto her cheek --

WILLIE
Oh no -- oh no

INDIANA
(studying the bug)
You know Willie Ill bet hes
mad because they were eating his
friends for dinner
bug

moves

there

San-

prince

WILLIE
Please -- oh please Im going to
die Get it off

Indiana shrugs and leans over and casually swats the horrible

off her face He and Short Round watch the insect skid across
the floor -- and suddenly disappear as if by magic

Puzzled they wander toward the wall leaving Willie behind
bathed in sweat staring at the ceiling --

WILLIE
What did I do to deserve this
trip

Kneeling by the wall Short Round examines the baseboard --

SHORT ROUND
It went under Hey I feel
wind Indy

Indiana knocks on the wall and considers the hollow sound He
moves back and looks at the whole wall Behind him Willie

past --
WILLIE
Im packing Im getting out of
here right now tonight

She dashes behind a screen to start getting dressed Meanwhile
Indy feels the marble walls He moves to a niche in which

is a small statue of Ganesha the friendly elephant god
Indiana lifts the statue -- and a panel in the wall opens slow-
ly Short Round looks amazed Indy watches the light fall
across the far wall of a tunnel as the door opens slowly
Indy peers into the tunnel at an old wall painting Spiderly
skrit calligraphy runs under a flanking illustration of a
bowing before a god
INDIANA
(He reads aloud an inscription

in Sanskrit)

SHORT ROUND
What does it mean Indy
with

tunnel

Indy

INDIANA
(translating)
Follow in the footsteps of
Shiva Do not betray his truth

Indy takes out the piece of cloth the boy gave him in Mayapore
the similarities are striking It is also a picture of Shiva
Sankara

INDIANA
(He repeats aloud the inscrip-
tion also written on the cloth)

Over behind the screen Willies getting into some silk pants
an Indian-style brocade bodice top --

WILLIE
I dont care if I have to walk to
Delhi Im -- hey

She notices Indy and Short Round bending to enter the dark
behind the wall
WILLIE (Contd)
Wait a minute Whatre you --
wherere you going
Indy pokes his head back into the room --

INDIANA
Lock your door and dont leave
until we get back

He disappears behind the wall and Willie looks worried
INT A PALACE TUNNEL - NIGHT
Indy and Short Round enter the secret passage and move forward
slowly into the inky darkness
SHORT ROUND
I dont think we suppose to be in
here Indy

They creep slowly down the dark tunnel It grows smaller and

ducks his head
what-—

SHORT ROUND (Contd)
I step on something

Their footsteps crunch on the tunnel floor

INDIANA
Youre right theres something
all over the floor

Even Short Round has to duck and Indy finally kneels to his
hands and knees

INDIANA (Contd)
Well have to crawl

As they crawl their hands and knees continue to crunch on
ever it is littering the ground

SHORT ROUND
Indy the floor -- there is some-
thing alive

Indiana gets a match out of his pocket He snaps it with his
thumb and the match flares -- a hideous insectarium a living
collection of the worlds ugliest antropods hexapods and arch-
nids

SHORT ROUND
Holy smoke -- Im scared Indy

Indiana turns and sees something else --

INDIANA
Theres a chamber here Come on --

Indy finds an oil lamp on the wall and lights it Short Round
happily scampers into the chamber and Indy follows him

Suddenly

Short

the door slides shut -- trapping them inside

INT THE CHAMBER

Indiana lights a match and finds another oil lamp He and

Round look for a way to open the door that closed behind them
but they have no luck

INDIANA
Damn

Then they hear Willies voice echoing down the short tunnel

WILLIE (0S)
Hey -- where are you

INT WILLIES SUITE

Back in the suite Willie stands by the entrance to the secret
passage peering into the dark tunnel --

WILLIE (Contd)
Indiana Jones Are you in there

INT THE CHAMBER

Indy mutters irritably to himself --

INDIANA
Yes were in here

He looks everywhere for something to open the door Short
Round spots a loose brick and moves it --

SHORT ROUND
Indy I found a --

Suddenly they hear a rumble and Indy turns to see the opposite
wall moving -- the spikes start appearing Their lethal points
protrude from the wall as it starts closing in toward Indy and
Short Round

SHORT ROUND (Contd)
Indy --

Shorty points up and Indiana sees more spikes descending from
ceiling Indy turns toward the door and shouts --
INDIANA
Uh -- Willie

Willie listens and looks scared --

Willie finds the courage to finally whimper and step into the
dark passage --

WILLIE
Oh hell -- I bet I get all dirty

INT THE TUNNEL

Willie starts down the dark tunnel toward the chamber

INDIANA (0S)
WILLIE

WILLIE

They hear her coming and Indy watches nervously as the spikes
draw even closer --
INDIANA

84 INT THE TUNNEL

Willie crawls and crunches on the littered floor --

WILLIE
Its all wet and icky Aaahh --

She sees the low lamp by the door to the chamber

SHORT ROUND (0S)
Please Willie

She grabs the lamp and turns it up so it burns brighter She
looks around -- and SCREAMS She sees the sickening swarming
mass of glistening insects crawling toward her attracted by

the
light --
WILLIE

Willie whines and frantically searches the wall Insects are
crawling and jumping on her and she kicks at them

INDIANA (0S)
A fulcrum release lever

WILLIE

Indy
87 INT THE SPIKE CHAMBER

Indiana and Short Round are backed against the wall and the
spikes are a foot away and moving in --
INDIANA
Look around Willie Theres got to
be a liever hidden somewhere Come
on you can do it
88 INT THE TUNNEL

Insects drop onto Willie from the ceiling and fly at her as she
flattens against the wall Then her elbow hits something -- a
loose stone She claws at it and it falls out of the wall
leaving a hole
WILLIE
Theres a hole I found a square
hole
INDIANA (0S)
Thats it -- the release lever --

WILLIE

The hole is revolting covered with squirming insects it
also
oozes some kind of glistening mucus
INDIANA (0S)
Reach inside
Willie moves her hand toward the nauseating hole then pulls
back

WILLIE
I cant Indy I cant

89 INT THE SPIKE TUNNEL

Indiana turns his head sideways and sucks in his breath but
the
deadly spikes are poking into his leater jacket now --
INDIANA
The lever Willie do it NOW
90 INT THE TUNNEL

Willie screams and jams her hand into the gross hole --
WILLIE
Oh God its soft -- its moving
INDIANA (0S)
Willie
91 INT THE SPIKE CHAMBER

Short Round is frightened to death and crying --
SHORT ROUND
Willie help us Hurry
92 INT THE TUNNEL

She hears Short Round crying and twists her hand in the
disgust-
ing hole Suddenly the door springs open Willie pulls her
hand
out and stares in horror -- her hand and arm are covered with
greenish slimey mung
93 INT THE SPIKE CHAMBER

The spikes suddenly retract disappearing into the wall and
clos-
ing Indy pulls Willie inside the chamber and the door slams
shut again Willie dances around yelling about the hideous
slime

on her arm

WILLIE
Get is off me -- get it off

Indy helps her wipe it off Willie falls back against the

door
WILLIE (Contd)
You left me out there What in
the hell were you doing in here
I want to leave this place right
now
She sees the same lever that Short Round pulled earlier and
grabs
for it Indiana dives and manages to stop her from activating
the spikes agian
INDIANA
Not that one We had enought of
that one thank you
He looks around and spots a small rock protruding from the
wall
Cautiously praying htat it wont activate another booby trap
Indy pushes the rock
A large door opens on the other side of the chamber -- a soft
wind howls past outside the chamber
94 INT THE WIND TUNNEL

Indiana Short Round and Willie exit the spike chamber and head
down a larger tunnel through which a roaring wind
intermittantly
blows howling eerily like a note of gloomy music
Indiana follows a curve in the tunnel and they see light
approaching
The wind holws another dramatic note which gales past them as
they reach the mouth of the tunnel
Indiana is joined by Willie and Short Round They all stop in
astonishment at the sight below them
95 INT THE TEMPLE OF DEATH

As the camera pulls back the mouth of the wind tunnel in
which
they are standing becomes just a small hole overlooking the
stag-

gering vastness of the incredible TEMPLE OF DEATH
by

The colossal subterranean temple has been carved out of a solid
mass of rock A vaulting cathedral-like ceiling is supported

rows of carved stone columns
Balconies overlook the temple floor Pillared halls leading to
dark side chambers Moving out of these chambers hundreds of

faithful worshippers chant as they enter the temple

Mammoth stone statues of elephants lions and demi-gods

(halfman

wor

altar

halfanimal monstrosities) loom above the swelling crowds or
shippers

As the wind howls out of the tunnel high above the temple the
worshippers chant in response to the strange tunnel music

INT THE TUNNEL

The moaning wind rushes past Indiana Willie and Short Round as
they watch the mystery cult below bowing toward an enormous

at the far end of the temple
This altar is a platform jutting out from the stone wall of the
cavern Separating the worshippers from this altar is a wide

crevasse out of which wisps of smoke rise occasionally

INT THE ALTAR
On the other side of the crevasse evil-looking priests
materialize out of clouds of swirling smoke The priests carry

smoke-billowing urns to a giant stone statue

Now we see the hideous protectress of the temple the

obscenely

god-

her

malevolent ombect of the cults devotion the bloodthirsty
dess KALI

The red-eyed priests bow at the base of the statue and gaze
reverently at their KALI MA Skulls surround her stone feet
carved serpents twist up her legs while around her waist there
is a guresome belt of human hands

Naked to the hips Kalis hair falls about her four arms In

hand she holds a sword in the second the severed head of a
like

giantWith her other hands she encourages her worshipers who
are chanting louder and louder

Kalis face is loathsome her earrings are two corpses Her
evil tongue extends out of her twisted mouth and what looks

read blood flows over her long fangs and down her naked

breasts

frame

Indian

INT THE WIND TUNNEL

Watching from the high opening Willie looks disgusted

WILLIE
What is it

INDIANA
Its a Thuggee ceremony Theyre
whorshipping Kali the goddess of
Death and Destruction

INT THE TEMPLE OF DEATH

A huge drum sounds three times and the chanting stops The
silence is chilling as another robed figure appears out of the
some on the altar

This is MOLA RAM the High Priest of the Thugge cult Mola
Rams red-rimmed eyes glare from the sunken sockets in his
sinister face Here is a man who looks as vile and diabolic
as the unholy goddess rising behind him

Up in the wind tunnel Indy stares down at the High Priest and
realizes that is was Mola Ram he saw conferring with Chattar

in the palace garden

As the drum booms three times more Mola Ram lifts one arm
up from his emaciated body and suddenly there is a scream

All heads turn toward an unfortunate struggling Indian begin
dragged out by priests The mans face and body are wildly
painted He screams again as hes tied onto a square iron
laying atop a large flat stone

Mola Ram steps forward to the stretched-out victim and the

looks up into the High Priests grotesque face --
Suddenly Mola Rams hand shoots out toward the mans chest --

and
pierces it The High Priests hand sinks into the victims
writing body and rips out his living heart
100 INT THE WIND TUNNEL

Willie covers her mouth --
WILLIE
Oh my God He ripped out his --
he killed him
INDIANA
Nothe hearts still beating
101 INT THE ALTAR

Indeed the bloody heart is still beating in Mola Rams hand
He lifts the heart into the air and the worhippers begin the
chant
THE MULTITUDE
Jai ma Kali jai ma Kali
Stranger still the sacrificial victim is still alive -- there
is
no evidence of a gash on his chest only a reddish mark The
priests add chains to the iron frame and carry the victim over
toward a hoist hanging over the crevasse
The man thrashes about helplessly on the iron frame as it is up
ended and then lowered with the victim hanging face down --
As the sacrificial victim looks down into the crevasse below --
he screams -- and we see the molten lava bubbling crimson at
the
bottom of the chasm
102 INT THE WIND TUNNEL

Willie closes her eyes but Indy and Short Round watch horrified
as the iron frame is lowered -- and the bloody heart continues
to
beat in Mola Rams hand -- and the molten lava burns and
flickers

as the screaming victim is lowered deeper into the crevasse

body

and

INT THE TEMPLE

The weird paint on the victims face starts to smoke and sizzle

the mans skin blisters as hes lowered within feet of the
lava His flesh smokes and he screams one last time as his

bursts into flame
The iron frame sinks and submerges into the boiling fiery lava

INT THE ALTAR

Above the crevasse Mola Ram continues to hold the heart in
his hand -- the heart is smoking and bursts into flames - and
disappears

INT THE TEMPLE

The iron frame is raised out of the lava -- the metal glows
like a branding iron but there is no trace of the sacrificed
victim

INT THE WIND TUNNEL

As the wind howls again Willie and Short Round look sickened

appalled by the ceremony Even Indy seems shaken by what they
are witnessing

THE MULTITUDE
Jai ma Kali jai ma Kali

INT THE ALTAR

Moal Ram raises both hands and his voice echoes strange

incanta-

to-

tions Behind him three priests carry cloth-wrapped objects

ward the altar

INT THE WIND TUNNEL

Willie is crying and her voice is shoking as she turns awa from
the hideous ritual --
WILLIE
Lets go Lets get out of here

INDIANA
Quiet
109 INT THE ALTAR

The priests reverently unwrap three conical pieces of
crystallized quartz The place the three stones below the sta-
tue of Kali and slowly the smoke around the altar swirls --
The smoke is drawn to the three stones and they actually start
in-
haling the piraling smoke The smoke disappears into the
stones
and the air clears Then the three stones start to glow a
haunting incandescent white
110 INT THE WIND TUNNEL

Short Round looks scared Willie is still crying -- Indy
waits
horrified but fascinated
INDIANA
The village knew their rock was
magic -- but they didnt know it
was one of the lost Sankara Stones
SHORT ROUND
Why they glow like that
INDIANA
Legend says that when the stones
are brought together the diamonds
inside of them will glow
Willie wipes her eyes and becomes more interested --
WILLIE
Diamonds
111 INT THE ALTAR

The Sankara Stones shimmer brightly and inside the
crystallized

quartz the enormous sparkling diamonds of legend are now re-
vealed
Mola Ram stands facing Kali with his arms outstretched and
kneels and bows and then walks off the altar and disappears

112 INT THE WIND TUNNEL

Indiana sees the woshippers below start to leave the temple
He
looks at Willie and Short Round

INDIANA
Okay -- now listen -- you wait here
and keep quiet Shorty keep an
eye on her

Short Round nods and hands Indy his bullwhip and shoulder bag
Willie sees Indiana peering down at the sheer drop below the
mouth of the wind tunnel

WILLIE
Wait -- whatre you doing

INDIANA
Im going down

WILLIE
Down Down there Are you
crazy --

INDIANA
Im not leaving without those
stones

WILLIE

Youre gonna get killed chasing
after your damn fortune and
glory

INDIANA
(looking at her)
Maybesomeday
(smiling)
Not today

SHORT ROUND
I keep my eye peeled Indy

Indiana nods and looks down at the now empty temple Then he
slips down from the mouth of the wind tunnel
113 INT THE TEMPLE WALL

Indiana skillfully clumbs down an enormous tmeple column --
find-

ing footholds on stone cobras carved lions and the stone
breasts

of dancing girls Slowly he makes his way down and swings
across
a balcony
114 INT THE BALCONY

Indiana walks quietly along the balcony overlooking the temple
He stops -- between him and the altar is the crevasse with the
lava bubbling fire at the bottom
Indiana looks across the gulf and sees another column near the
altar at the top of which stone elephants are perched Indy
curls his whip and suddenly lets it fly --
The whip cracks and its end wraps tightly around the tusk of
one
of the stone elephants From the balcony Indy tugs the whip
taut takes a breath and runs --
115 INT THE CREVASSE

Indiana leaps and swings out on the whip arching down and up
over the chasm of fiery lava in a spectacular curving jump
116 INT THE LATAR

Indy lands on his feet and turns to release the whip Short
Round waves to Indy that the coast is clear Indy snaps the
whip
-- it releases from the elephant tusk and drops
Recurling the whip Indy attaches it to his belt and moves to-
ward the towering statue of Kali The three Sankara stones
start

to glow and Indiana approaches them cautiously

Reaching the stones Indys face is lighted by them He
notices

that one of them (sthe stone from Mayapore village) has strange

lines painted across it

Suspiciously Indy touches the stone but it doesnt burn He
lifts it carefully and peers into it The enormous diamond
sparkles inside He places the stone in his shoulder bag and
reaches for the others

117 INT THE WIND TUNNEL

Short Round and Willie watch apprehensively as Indiana bags the

three stones
118 INT THE ALTAR

Indiana backs away and looks up at the horrific statue of Kali

It seems to be watching him He turns and is about to go when
he

hears something --

It sounds like a voice and Indy is afraid to turn -- could it
be

Kali The he hears other noises echoing and turns slowly
Real-

alizing the sounds are coming from behind the altar Indy moves

around it toward the back
119 INT THE WIND TUNNEL

Short Round and Willie are mystified as they see Indiana
dissap-

pear behind the altar

WILLIE
Oh hell wheres he going

Short Round looks worried Then the wind rushes past them
quickly

and howls its somber musical note However the wind sounds
dif-

ferent this time its tone quavering slightly

Short Round is puzzled and looks around He feeezes when he
sees

two shadowy figures coming down the tunnel toward them -- the
bodies causing the tone of the wind to shift eerily --

Willie notices Short Round pulling a dagger from his belt -

WILLIE
Whatre you --

Suddenly she turns and screams as two huge Thuggee guards rush
by

Col-

the

toward

out

at them One grabs at Short Round but the kid slashes the
guards hand with his dagger

Willie tries to get past the other guard but he snatches her
the arm and pulls her toward him -- from her training at the
lege of Hard Knocks Willie successfully knees the big man in
balls

WILLIE (Contd)
Keep your paws off letch

The man groans and sinks to his knees Willie sees that Short
Round is in trouble She runs over leaps onto the back of the
other guard and starts ripping his hair out

Short Round picks up his fallen dagger The big guard lurches
backwards and smashes Willie into the rocky wall of the tunnel
Willie falls to the floor

Short Round approaches holding the man at bay with his dagger
Willie turns as the other guard the one she kneed crawls

her -- Willie scoops up some dirt and throws it The man claws
at his eyes and Willie jumps up

SHORT ROUND
Run Willie

Willie starts to run and Short Round backs away keeping the
guard at a distance with his dagger Suddenly the guard cries

in Hindi and dives at Short Round

Panicking Shorty tries to run after Willie -- but hes

tripped

Willie

caught

lifts

and

The guard has Short Round by the foot and drags him back
looks around and stops running She sees Short Round is
SHORT ROUND (Contd)
No Run Go get help

Willie hesitates then runs down the tunnel Meanwhile a mam-
moth hand clutches Short Rounds throat -- the giant guard

Shorty completely off the ground and the kid looks terrified

helpless as he dangles in the air

INT CHAMBER BEHIND ALTAR

ndiana enters the dark chamber behind the altar The only il-

lumination is the back-light streaming around the silhouetted

statue of Kali

ndy slowly crosses a narrow stone bridge and moves toward a
cy-

lindrical shaft of light rising up from what appears to be an

enormous hole

ndy hears voices and the clink of metal against rock as he
con-

tinues forward The ground is dark in front of the large hole

He edges toward the precipice and the light rising up
illuminates

the look of shock on his face as he peers down into Hell
121 INT THE THUGGEE MINES

Indy looks into a deep pit around which concentric paths leads
off

into numerous narrow tunnels Crawling out of these burrows

scrawny children drag sacks of dirt and rock Other hollow-
eyed

children pull these sacks to mine cars waiting on rails

Straining to lift the rocks into the mine cars several of the

children slip and fall Bare-chested Thuggee guards shout at
the

enslaves children and kick those whove fallen

For these children there would seem to be only one hope --
death

-- an end to their travail

Indiana edges around the hole looking into the ghastly mine
and

feeling as if hes discovered an inferno of misery as grotesque

as Dantes

Indy shifts the bag of stones on his shoulder He hesitates
and

to

considers his choice he has the Sankara Stones and can leave
with them now

But Indy hears the pleading cries of one child and peers down
see a burly Thuggee guard beating the pitiful little slave

Indy
gets angrier and angrier as he watches
He finally steps over the grabs a boulder He lifts it and
flings it down into the mine --
122 INT THE MINE

We see Indiana above and the boulder hurtling down -- it
crashes
onto the head of the Thuggee guard who hits the ground like a
sack of cement
12 INT THE CHAMBER

Indy sees the startled slave children looking up at him in
shock
He smiles victoriously at the Thuggees below whove run over to
see what happened
Indys smile seems to fade as his anger turns to surprise as he
feels something unnerving
Dirt is crumbling away from the rim of the hole a small
landslide starting beneath his feet Suddenly the floor gives
way and Indy slips
The entire rim of the hole shears off and Indy topples with it
and plunges down into the mine toward the assembled guards who
scatter -- Indy yells as he falls and it echoes
CUT TO
124 INT A CELL - NIGHT

Indianas yell continues to echo -- his head jerks suddenly --
Indy jolts awake as if coming out of a nightmare awakened by
his

own reverberating shout

Indy is lying on the rocky floor of a dark cavecell He lifts
his hands and discovers that they are chained In the murky
light he sees Short Round sitting in chains across the cell

SHORT ROUND
Indy -- you knocked out when you
fall You okay
sit-

the

Indiana nods groggily He sees a young slave worker

ting near Short Round Through the iron bars of the
sees the children slaving in the mine tunnels

SHORT ROUND
(indicating the kid)
This is Nainsukh -- from the vil-
lage They bring him here to dig
in the mines

INDIANA
Why
NAINSUKH
Children are small -- we can work

in tunnels Now I am too old

SHORT ROUND
What they do to you now

NAINSUKH
I pray to Shiva -- let me die
But I do not Now -- now the
evil of Kali take me

SHORT ROUND
How

NAINSUKH
They will make me drink blood of
Kali Then I fall into black
sleep of Kali Ma

INDIANA
What is that

NAINSUKH
I become like them I be alive --
nut like in nightmare You drink
the blood you not wake up from
nightmare of Kali Ma

in rags

Theres a noise and they see two guards and a priest outside

cell

like a trapped animal awaiting the inevitable

Indiana and Short Round are pushed down a tunnel by guards
are stopped at a door and shoved inside

INT MOLA RAMS CHAMBER

Indiana and Short Round stumble into the chamber It is a

fying gallery of occult yantras ritualistic statues and grisly
icons of the evil Thuggee sect

Grotesque statues of Kalis baleful minions line the walls In

corner there is another statue of Kali herself draped with
flowers necklaces of real human skills and slithering belts of
live snakes

Fresh blood has been splashed over the statue and at its base

the three Sankara Stones recovered from Indiana Mola Ram sits
in a yoga position near the statue of Kali

Mola Ram opens his eyes and he sees Indiana and Short Round
standing in chains before him

MOLA RAM
You were caught trying to steal
the Sankara Stones

INDIANA
(shrugging)
Nobodys perfect The way I
heard it you stole one of them
from a small village

Mola Ram stands and gazes transfixed at the stones glowing on
altar

MOLA RAM
There were five stones in the
beginning Over the centuries
they were dispersed by wars
sold off by thieves like you

INDIANA
Two are still missing

MOLA RAM
No They are here -- somewhere
A century ago when the British
raided this temple and butchered
my people a loyal priest his the
last two stones down here in the
catacombs

INDIANA
Thats what youve got these chil-
dren -- these slaves digging for

MOLA RAM
They dig for the gems to support
our cause They also search for
the last two stones Soon we will
have all five Sankara Stones and
the Thuggees will be all powerful

INDIANA

Nobody can say you dont have a
vivid imagination

MOLA RAM
You do not believe me You will
Dr Jones You will become a true
believer

The door opens and Mola Ram bows slightly as the little

Maharajah

enters Indy looks surprised and Short Round tenses
MOLA RAM (Contd)
Your Highness will witness the

thiefs conversion

Mola Ram nods and two guards grab Indy They drag him

struggling

of

to a rock and chain him to it Short Round scuffles as hes
pulled aside to watch

Remembering the High Priests earlier open-heart surgery Indi-
ana looks worried as Mola Ram approaches him --

MAHARAJAH
You will not suffer I recently
became of age and tasted the blood
of Kali

Now the young initiate comes forward and Indiana looks startled

its Nainsukh He is wearing robes and his eyes are glowing
strangely Nainsukh hands Mola Ram a hollow human skull full
blood

The guards hold Indianas head back and force his mouth open
Mola Ram tips the skull and blood spills out of its death-
grinning jaws and flows into Indianas mouth Indy gags --

Suddenly he spits the blood spraying Mola Ram and the little

Maharajah Looking at his blood-splattered clothes the
Mahara-

jah is furious

MOLA RAM
Hold him

The little princes eyes glow angrily and he hisses at Indy --
MAHARAJAH
You will learn to obey because

you are powerless

The little Maharajah pulls a small krtya from his robes -- Indy
sees that the doll has been crudely fashioned to resemble him

MAHARAJAH (Contd)
I control you now

The Maharajah turns and sticks the doll into a flaming urn

In-
diana suddenly cries out and twists in pain as he is burned
The
little prince smiles evilly and puts the doll back into his
robes
Then he goes over to where Indys whip and bag have been laid
He grabs the bullwhip
MAHARAJAH (Contd)
You told me that a whip could be
an enemy to its owner We shall
see Turn him over
As the guards turn Indy face down they rip off his jacket and
chain his ahnds to the rock The Maharajah uncurls the whip --
he
notices Short Round smiling snidely --
Suddenly the Maharajah cracks the whip -- it lashes out and
cuts
into Short Rounds shoulder Blood appears and Short Round
looks

stunned by the lash and by the fact the Marahajah knows who to
use the whip
be-

suffer

but

down

fissure

MAHARAJAH (Contd)
As Dr Jones suggested I have
been practicing

The little Maharajah whirls and lashes the whip again Indiana
jerks as the bullwhip rips through his shirt and tears open his
flesh The Maharajah lashes again and again -- blood spurts
across Indys tattered shirt

As the whipping continues- Short Round jumps as if he is also

ing beaten His eyes fill with tears as he watches Indy

Finally the little Maharajah lets the whip fall limp As the
Maharajah approaches Indy Short Round lunges as him angrily

the guards restrain him

Indiana groans as hes turned over Blood trickles from his
mouth and he stares up hatefully at Mola Ram

MOLA RAM
The British in India will be
slaughtered Then we will over-
run the Moslems and force their
Allah to bow to Kali

Mola Ram is once again given the human skull by a priest and he
lifts it toward Indys face --

MOLA RAM (Contd)
And then the Hebrew God will fall
and finally the Christian God will
be cast down and forgotten

Indys head is held back and Mola Ram spills the blood -- it
flows out of the mouth of the skull into Indys mouth

MOLA RAM (Contd)
Soon Kali Ma will rule the world

Indys eyes look horrified as the blood flows from the skull

his choking throat -- some of the blood spills and falls to the
floor --
We see the very earth trembling as the evil spreads -- a

appears beneath Indys feet and a small line of crimson lava
oozes out and smiles evilly across the floor

127 INT WILLIES SUITE - NIGHT

Diaphanous curtains billow silently into the moonlighted room

Two exotic birds sit on a golden perch their eyes clicking

watchfully Suddenly the brids shriek and flap away --

Willie stumbles through the secret door and falls into the
room

Insects cover her and she shimpers as she knocks them off She

manages to stagger to her feet and she heads for the door
128 INT THE PALACE - NIGHT

Willie rushes out of her room and runs through the deserted
pal-

ace looking for help She flies down the moonlit corridors
past

the huge wall paintings

She stops by a courtyard and calls out desperately but there
is

no one around She backs away down a hallway and then jumps --

seeing something in a mirror a face looms behind her and she

screams

Willie whirls and sees Chattar Lal the Prime Minister
approach-

ing her

WILLIE
Oh my God you scared me Listen
youve got to help We found this
tunnel --

Captain Blumburtt comes around a corner and interrupts --
CAPT BLUMBURTT

(to Chattar Lal)

The two men exchange dubious looks Willie grabs Blumburtt by
the arm and they start down the hall

CHATTAR LAL

sense

WILLIE
Im afraid theyll kill them We
saw horrible things down there --
they had a human sacrifice and they
ripped a mans heart out

CAPT BLUMBURTT

got the sacred stones that Indy was
searching for

CHATTAR LAL
I sense the fumes of opium in all
this Prehaps Miss Scott picked
up the habit in Shanghai

WILLIE
Whatre you talking about -- Im

129 INT WILLIES SUITE

She leads them into her suite Willie points to the dark
opening

in the wall Blumburtt picks up an oil lamp and holds it
toward

the opening -- suddenly he jumps back as Indiana emerges

INDIANA
(smiling faintly)
Whatre we playing hid and seek
Theyre all startled Willie looks relieved and rushes over to
Indy and puts her arms around him

WILLIE
Oh Indy you got away Tell them
what happened they wont believe
me --

He puts his arms around her and feels her trembling from fear

and
anger He walks her to the bed and helps her sit down --
INDIANA
Its okay Youre all right now
WILLIE
They think Im insane Tell them
Im not Indy Please -- help me
The awful events have taken their toll and Willie covers her
face

and cries like a scared kid Indy gets her to lie down on the
bed He sits beside her and smiles and touches her hair --

INDIANA
Hey I thought you were supposed
to be a real tropper Willie

He wipes the tears from her face and she holds his hand --

WILLIE
(quietly)
What

INDIANA
Youve got to go to sleep now

WILLIE
(softly)
I want to go home

INDIANA
I dont blame you this hasnt
been what youd call a fun vaca-

tion

She smiles a little despite herself and he touches her cheek
He eyes are already closing and he stands up

A servant is entering the suite to take care of Willie She
cov-
sers her with a blanket and start dropping the mosquito netting

as Indy walks off toward the verandah with Blumburtt and
Chattar

Lal

130 EXT THE VERANDAH - DAWN

The first light is breaking over the mountain peaks Coming
out
onto the verandah Indy and the other two men see the cavalry
troops breaking camp below and readying their horses and
trucks
INDIANA
Ive spent by life crawling around
in caves and tunnels -- I shouldnt

have let somebody like Willie go
in there with me

CAPT BLUMBURTT
Miss Scott panicked

INDIANA
When she saw the insects she passed
out cold I carried her back to
her room She was sleeping when I
re-entered the tunnel to look
around

CHATTAR LAL
As she slept she undoubtedly had
nightmares

Indiana looks at him and nods

INDIANA
Then she must have run out of the
room and you found her

CAPT BLUMBURTT
Did you discover anything in that
tunnel Dr Jones

Indiana stares into the rising sun

INDIANA
Nothing Just a dead end That
tunnels been deserted for years

A sergeant-major shouts up to Blumburtt that the troops are
ready
CAPT BLUMBURTT
Well Mr Prime Minister my re-
port will duly note that we
found nothing unusual here in
Pankot

CHATTAR LAL
Im sure that will please the
Maharajah Captain

CAPT BLUMBURTT

The whine of the bagpipes is eerily muted in the dark room
Through the gently swaying mosquito netting we see Willie

on the bed
Then through her side of the gauzy netting we see the door
opening across the room Indiana enters quietly and moves
toward
the bed his eyes fixed on Willies sleeping body
Indy sits down on the bed slowly Willie turns in her sleep
and
opens her eyes Through the mosquito netting she sees Indy

sit-
ting with his back to her

WILLIE
Indy Did you walk to them

INDIANA
Yes

WILLIE
So now they believe me

INDIANA
Yes they believe you

Indiana speaks in a strange monotone

WILLIE
Then theyll send the soldiers
down into the temple

Willie looks at Indianas back and continues quietly
WILLIE (Contd)

I was scared to death last night
when I thought they were going to

kill you
INDIANA
No they wont kill me
WILLIE

(smiling faintly)
You know youve been nothing but
trouble since I hooked up with
you -- but I have to admit Id
miss you if I lost you

Now Indiana starts to turn slowly

INDIANA
You wont lose me Willie

She sees him turn and his face slowly comes toward the mosquito
netting -- his face pushes into the netting and Willie looks
stunned as Indys mouth opens --

He starts hissing grotesquely smoke billows out of his mouth
and

the mosquito netting BURNS OPEN to expose his terrifying face

moving toward Willie --

She is forzen with fear and unable to utter a sound as Indys
malevolent face looms at her -- and then she notices his eyes -
his eyes glowing a hellish luminscent yellow

Willie SCREAMS

She suddenly bolts from the bed and tries to run -- Indiana
goes
into a rage ripping the mosquito netting from the bed as he
fol-
lows her
INDIANA
No Ive found it -- you cant --

Kali knows

Willie tries the door but its locked She sees Indiana moving
toward her ranting incoherently as he smashes a vase out of his

way --
INDIANA
-- been too many lies -- theres no
gods heaven -- just -- the horror
Ive seen it -- life preying on

life

Willie cowers in a corner horrified by the transformation she

sees in Indiana Shouting and pacing Indy holds his head
against

the pain of his terrible thoughts --

INDIANA
-- rivers -- destroying mountains --
a comet in space -- exploding
(holding his head)
Aaahh -- the screams -- pitiful
people -- their pain -- the hate --
and greed -- always greed

The light throws his shadow over Willie -- a giant shadow
float-

ing back and forth over her as she cries in the corner unable
to

fight the evil devouring Indiana

INDIANA
-- but Ive found -- Kalis touch
Death -- no more lies -- the death
Ive been searching for

(shouting)

Quit crying She can hear you --
Kali knows fear -- dont you under-
stand -- Kali is freedom

Indiana stops pacing and Willie freezes in terror Now a

bizarre

CUT TO

133 INT THE TEMPLE OF DEATH - DAY

A sea of frightening faces once again intones the horrible
sacri-

ficial chant Among the shorshippers the little Maharajah
sits

on a riased platform Like the other believers he stares
across

the crevasse at the altar of Kali Ma

The wailing wind howls out of the high tunnel and the
terrifying

chanting reaches a fever pitch
134 INT THE TMEPLE ALTAR

And once again the three sacred Sankara Stones glow magically

Mola Ram materializes evilly amidst the swirling smoke and he

begins chanting in Sanskrit

Beside the altar half-clad female acolytes pass in front of
the

robed priests -- with their fingers the women paint two white

lines across the priests foreheads

An acolyte moves in front of Chattar Lal -- the Prime Minister
is

now dressed in robes As the devotional markings are painted
on

his forehead Chattar Lal translates the High Priests speech
to

yellow light wipes across the room Indiana turns and watches
silently as two Thuggee guards emerge from a secret doorway
thats opened --

The shadows of the Thuggee guards loom over Willie and she
SCREAMS again

Indiana who stands next to him

Mola Ram is telling the faithful
of out victory He says the
British have left the palace

INDIANA
Yes I understand

Indiana bows his head to receive the mystical markings He

tens to Mola Rams rantings -- Indys eyes are ominously vacant
as he stares up at the hideous statue of Kali

INT MINE TUNNELS - DAY

Beneath the temple down in the bowels of the mountain the

ful children dig at the earth with their fingers A FAT GUARD
slouches down the tunnel flogging malingerers with a aleather
strap

Short Round sweats next to the others clawing at the rocks
doomed to work with them now in their search for the last wo

Sankara Stones

The leather strap suddenly flays Short Rounds back and he

manages not to scream out in pain The fat guard passes --

Round and the other kids pull a large rock which suddenly comes
loose out of the wall --

They fall back and see theyve exposed a vein of molten lava
Hearing their shouts the fat guard returns -- yelling at their
stupidity he whips them and shoves them aside brutally

Short Round see the fat guards eyes glowing fiercely in anger
Suddenly the fissure shoots out steam and spews some molten

over the guards legs

The guard screams and falls to the ground thrashing about
ing to kick the searing lava off his smoking flesh

As the other kids cower Short Rounds humane instincts cause

to jump forward to help the guard who moments earlier was

beating

him --

Short Round tosses dirt on the guards legs and grabs a gunny
sack and starts rubbing the lava off Shorty notices something
strange
dim-

Shorty

night-

over

the

over

The guards eyes which were glowing yellow before are now
ming and returning to normal The moaning guard looks at
thankfully and then looks around as if waking from a nightmare
SHORT ROUND
(to another slave kid)

His eyes -- they go out

Other guards appear and lift the guard -- suddenly he starts
struggling against the guards not wanting to return to the

mare of Kali --
FAT GUARD
(as hes dragged away)

No NO
SHORT ROUND

The pain -- the pain makes him wake up
(thinking quickly)

Indy I can make Indy wake up

But the other guards push and beat the children back to work
Short Round is shoved against a wall and groans -- he reaches

and grabs a large rock lifting it defiantly --
But rather than heaving it at the guard Short Round smashes

rock down on the leg chains binding him to the other children
Shorty beats at the chain with the rock determined to escape

SHORT ROUND
Indy

INT THE TEMPLE OF DEATH

The wind moans and joins Mola Rams voice echoing maniacally

the multitude gathered in the enormous temple On his throne
the little Maharajah listens transfixed

INT THE ALTAR

Chattar Lal watches Indiana staring hypnotically at the High
Priest as he speaks --
CHATTAR LAL
You understand what he tells us

INDIANA
Kali Ma protects us now and for-
ever and we must pledge our
devotion by worshipping her with
an offering of flesh and blood

Suddenly htere is a heart-rending scream of terror and the
priests draf forward the next sacrificial victim --

Indianas glowing eyes watch emotionlessly as Willie is brought
out Dressed in a Rajput maidens outfit Willie has been

jewel-
ed and draped with flowers -- a strange contrast as she
struggles
desperately
CHATTAR LAL
Your friend has seen and she has
heard -- now she will not talk
As Willie is dragged past she sees Indy and calls to him --
WILLIE
Indy Help me Indy
Willie is shocked seeing that Indiana remains impassive and un-
caring as shes dragged to her death
CHATTAR LAL
(to Indy)
This will prove your devotion to
Kali
Indiana looks away from Willies terrified face and stares up
adoringly at the monstrous statue of his goddess Kali
138 INT THE MINE

In the dark tunnel a rock smashes down onto a chain -- and
breaks it Short Round is exhausted He looks around
furtively

and sees a guard approaching

Short Round takes a chance -- he dives and rolls across the
tunnel He ducks behind a mine car full of rocks being pushed
out by two chained children

The guard lumbers past unsuspectingly as Short Round makes his
escape using the moving mine car as cover

INT THE ALTAR
Up in the temple Willie continues to struggle as her legs are

strapped to the iron sacrifical frame Chattar Lal grabs her
hand and ties it down Willies free hand reaches out

imploring-

ly toward Indiana --
WILLIE
(hoarsely)
Please God dont let them do
this to me -- help me Indy
He reaches out slowly and Willie grabs his hand tightly Indy
looks into her eyes and then stares at her hand -- and slowly
lifts it and starts tying it to the iron frame

WILLIE (Contd)
No -- no

Willie cries is disbelief as Indiana calmly betrays her

INT THE MINES BELOW

Short Round races up a tunnel and then flattens himself behind

corner He peers anxiously into a large carven and sees two
guards walking away

When the coast is clear Short Round darts across the cavern to

long wooden ladder tilted up against a wall Short Round looks
up the high ladder and sees a kid with a sack of rocks

descending

grunts

from a burrow-hole half-way up the wall

The exhausted kid nearly collapses at the bottom -- then jumps
seeing Short Round Shorty motions for him to keep quiet
Amaxed the kid watches Short Round scramble up the ladder
Shorty continues until he is high above the floor

Dirty faces stare out of the high burrow as Short Round stops
climbing The kids are astonished as Short Round suddenly

and kicks the ladder away from the wall

The high ladder falls in an arc and what seem like sure suicide
slowly resembles a mini-Indiana Junes stunt as Short Round

swings
to the other side of the falling ladder --
Short Round holds on for dear life as the ladder crashes
against
the opposite cavern wall -- giving Short Round access to the
roof-hole that leads up to the temple
Short Round scurries up the ladder and pulls himself up into
the
chamber behind the altar He looks at the light flaring around
the statue of Kali --
SHORT ROUND
Indy --
141 INT THE TEMPLE OF DEATH

Chains clank and gears grind as the sacrificial frame is raised
over the crevasse Stretched out on it Willie looks horrified
as she hangs suspended face down above the boiling lava
The frame and victim descend slowly into the crevasse and the
crowd around the little Maharajah changs louder
142 INT THE REAR CHAMBER

Short Round dashes across the dark chamber behind the altar
He
peers out and sees Willie disappearing into the crewasse He
sees Indiana watching impassively --
SHORT ROUND
No -- Indy -- wake up
Then Shorty sees a flaming torch hanging on a wall bracket and
he
has an idea
143 INT THE ALTAR

Short Round suddenly darts out onto the altar and Mola Ram sees
him and yells Several priests grab for Shorty He eludes the
first priest smashes the second in the stomach with his head
and runs like a little quarterback toward the fiery torch --

Short Round snatches the torch from the wall and charges toward
and

Shorty

with

glow

Indiana Seeing him coming Indys eyes start glowing yellow

when Short Round runs up to him Indiana suddenly swings and
backhands the little guy brutally across the face

The torch flies out of Shortys hand as hes knocked against at
wall by Indys vicious blow -- Short Round wipes a little blood

from his chin and stares at his hero in wounded disbelief

Chattar Lal watches approvingly -- a priest moves toward

Chattar Lal looks back toward the crevasse --

Willie hangs on the lowering frame heat waves rising up now to
scald her skin and she chokes as the sulphuric air burns her
lungs

Meanwhile Short Round is crawling backwards across the floor

a look of terror on his face -- Indiana stalks him hissing
snarling his eyes lgowing --

Short Round springs to his feet and tries to run -- Indy grabs
him and pulls him -- Shortys hand grabs for another wall torch
and just manages to yank it free

Indiana spins Short Round and clutches his throat As Indy
strangles him Short Round struggles and finally jams the torch
into Indys side The fiery torch burns Indy smoking as it
sears his flesh and he yells in pain

SHORT ROUND
Wake up Its just a nightmare
Indy Wake up please Indy

Indiana writhes in pain and Short Round sees the evil yellow

in Indys eyes getting dimmer and finally going out Now it
seems like theold Indiana staring at him --

SHORT ROUND (Contd)
Indy you back

Suddenly a priest grabs Short Round and pulls him off Indiana

INDIANA
No Give him to me

Short Round is firghtened as Indy grabs him from the priest
Indy lifts Short Round into the air --

SHORT ROUND
No Indy no
He sets Short Round down on the brink of the crevasse an inch
from doom Shorty looks down at the lava and is terrified

Indiana finally flahses him a quick smile and winks

Then Indiana whirls and punches the priest in the face Short
Round cheers realizing that Indiana is back

SHORT ROUND (Contd)
We got to help Willie

Indiana springs into action stopping another priest with a

quick
punch in the stomach Then he rushes over to the crankwheel
and
pulley platform Indy jumps onto it yanking one priest off
who
spills onto the floor
A second priest who works the controls lowering the
sacrificial
frame sees Indy and releases the crankwheel --
Down in the crevasse Willie screams as the iron frame suddenly
plummets toward the fulminating lava
On the platform the priest lunges at Indiana -- Indy uses the
mans own momentum to throw him over his head Indy then dives
for the crankwheel and manages to stop it --
Down in the crevasse the fram jolts to a stop only yards above
the spumes of fiery lava The heat is so intense now that Wil-
lies clothes start smoking and she passes out
On the platform above Indiana cranks furiously raising the
sa-
crificial frame
144 INT THE TEMPLE

The chanting stops at the Kali worshippers notice the battle on
the altar The little Maharajah looks concerned and leaves
shoving through the crowd behind his bodyguards
145 INT THE ALTAR

Mola Ram shouts at his priests and another one of them runs to-
ward Indy on the platform Short Round dives and tackles the
priest

Wil-

Chattar Lal finally leaps onto the crankwheel platform and Indy
sees him pull a dagger He slashes at Indiana and Indy has to
let go of the crankwheel -- the gears scream and the chains
screech

Below in the crevasse the iron frame plunges again toward the
crimson lava

On the platform Indy hears the frame lowering and looks pan-
icked Chattar Lal slahses again with the dagger -- keeping

away from the cogwheel mechanism --

Indy suddenly kicks the dagger from Chattar Lals hand slugs
in the stomach and dives toward the cogwheel mechanism He
a iron rod and throws it into the gears --

the gears mangle the iron rod but finally grind to a stop
ana grabs the crankwheel and starts winding it up furiously

Meanwhile Short Round jumps onto the platform with Indy and
grabs a long wrench He starts swinging the wrench keeping

last priests off the platfrom

The sacrificial frame finally rises up into view and Indiana
grabs it and swings it over onto the platform He looks at

lie anxiously as he releases her bindings --
Willie moans and moves her head Indy pulls her off the frame
and she starts coughing Gasping for breath Willie ervives as

fresh air flows into her lungs

Finally Willie opens her eyes and she sees Indiana Then she
notices something else and manages to cry out hoarsely --

WILLIE
Look out --

Chattar Lal grabs a pistol from an unconscious guard and

Indiana

hand

whirls to see him pointing it -- Indy kicks the gun from his

and suddenly Chattar Lal starts shouting in a terrifying voice

Chattar Lals eyes glow as he lunges suicidally at Indiana at-
tempting to take Indy with him as he dives from the platform

with

smoke

Crashing into Indy Chattar Lal knocks both of them back onto
sacrificial frame which swings out over the crevasse --

Indy manages to dive off the frame just in time He grabs hold
of the platform as the crankwheel screams and the frame falls

Looking up from the depths of the crevasse we see the frame
Chattar Lal on it plummeting downward into the sulphurous
The frame finally crashes splashing into the molten lava

Chattar Lals body explodes inot flame friefly -- his flesh is
broiled off in an instant -- we glimpse a skeleton momentarily

and then all is consumed and obliterated by the blazing lava

scramble over to Short Round who jumps off the platform and they
follow him across the altar

Indy sees Mola Ram quickly collecting the sacred Sankara

Stones

tun-

Indiana rushes over and spins Mola Ram around --

He slugs the High Priest in the face and Mola Ram keels over
backwards against the statue of Kali Short Round helps stuff
the Sankara Stones into Indianas shoulder bag

INT THE REAR CHAMBER

Short Round Willie and Indiana rush across the chamber behind
the altar They run over to the ladder and start climbing down
into the mines

INT THE MINES

Willie follows Short Round Indiana jumps down last and pulls
the ladder away letting it crash to the floor so they wont be
followed

They draw the attention of the slave children working in the

nels around the cavern But its the sight of the approaching
guard that worries Indy --

INDIANA
Come on quick

They duck into one of the tunnels As they hide Indy watches
the guard passing

WILLIE
Whatre we going to do

Indiana looks around at the silent frightened children whove
stopped working in the tunnel and his anger darkens --

INDIANA
Were going to get them out
of here --

Then he looks at the bag holding the Sankara Stones and grows
still more determined --

INDIANA (Contd)
And then were going to get these
out of here --

(seething)
And somehow Im going to see this
place destroyed

148 INT THE CAVERN - MOMENTS LATER

A gaurd passing hears a voice and stops --

INDIANA (0S)
Ah sir Excuse me --

The guard turns and looks amazed to see Indy smiling at him
from
the mouth of the tunnel

INDIANA (Contd)
Listen Im from the union and Id
like to talk about the working
conditions here Could you step
inside a minute

Indy smiles again and disappears into the tunnel In
astonished
rage the guard draws his sword and goes after Indy into the

tun-

nel -- theres a pause and then we hear the guard yell
149 INT THE TUNNEL

Willie flattens against the wall as Indiana catapaults the big
guard past her back into the mine where hes set upon bu a
horde

of rebellious slave children
The kids swarm over the guard like jackalas and we see Short
pull a key from the struggling guards robe

CuT TO

MONTAGE - THE MINES

A key is twisted and the chains are pulled from kids legs

Elsewhere more chains are unlocked and rattle free Liberated
kids spill out of the tunnels

A guard is tripped and attacked by a horde of ex-slaves

In another location kids wrap captured guards in layers of
chains

High up on a ledge a fleeing gaurd skids to a stop when he
kids charging at him He sees more kids rushing from behind
The guard scrams as he dives off the ledge

(END MONTAGE)

INT BEHIND THE ALTAR - DAY

Freed children scramble up numerous ladders to escape the mines
below They follow the mass of children moving toward the

altar

INT THE ALTAR

On the altar under the statue of Kali Willie and Short Round
are helping Indy and some of the bigger children rip down a
long wooden panel decorated with hideous Kali figures

The childrens escape is blocked by the chasm separating the
altar from the deserted sorshippers area of the temple The
swelling crowds of children push and teeter dangerously on the
edge of the fire pit

Indiana and the others carry the wooden panel through the crowd
toward the chasm They stand it up and when Indy gives thw

they drop it --

The panel crashes across the chasm forming a plank across which
the children now begin running to safety

INT BEHIND THE ALTAR

The last of the children scramble up the ladders and run toward

the front of the altar

INT THE ALTAR
The childrens bare feet stomp across the wooden plank -- below
them the lava of the fire pit bubbles and shows outbursts of

flame

Indy stares at the plank and sees that its starting to smoke
from the intese heat rising up

On the far side of the plank the children safely across

scatter

plank

through the deserted temple toward freedom

Willie and Short Round help the last kids out onto the plank --
Indy sees one childs foot break though the smoldering wood --
the kid in front pulls the child to safety

Willie and Short Round start to go out onto the plank but Indy
shouts at them --

INDIANA
No wait
He runs over and pulls them aside -- he steps out onto the
and takes a few steps to test it -- suddenly the plank bursts
into flame in the middle
Indy takes one more step -- and then the plank breaks Indy

dives back to the ledge of the altar and Willie and Short Round
grab him and pull him up and the wooden plank plummets into the
fiery chasm

WILLIE
Whatre we going to do

INDIANA
Theres got to be another way out

CUT TO

re-

INT A TUNNEL

Indiana Willie and Short Round run through the deserted mine
tunnels They hear a rumbling noise and Indy leads them down a
side tunnel They stop and peer into a quarry

INT THE QUARRY CAVERN

A large cavern is the depository for the mine cars rolling in
with loads of rock Emaciated children (still unaware of the

volt and the other childrens escape) break their backs shoving
the heavily-loaded mine cars

Thuggee guards supervise the deadening work while others oper-
ate the pulley-and-hoist system used to drag the cars up the
sloped dump ramp

Behind this operation a thunderous waterfall cascades into a
huge cistern From there chutes deply the rushing water to
power the large conveyor belt below it

As the cars rise up the ramp they tip and spill rocks onto the
conveyor belt which carries them toward an awesome stone

cylinder

heap

and

that rolls relentlessly crushing the rocks into sand
From the side tunnel Indiana watches the noisy operation
INDIANA
Those empty cars have got to go
out of the mines
Willie and Short Round watch the children push the empty mine
cars The cars gain momentum and roll away down two dark tun-
nels
INDIANA (Contd)
Come on lets see if we can
catch a ride
Tey duck out of the tunnel and run for cover behind a slag
Loaded mine cars roaring down from the mines hurtle past them

crash to a stop against the cars in front

INDIANA (Contd)
Okay Shorty -- go
Indy

out

into

reaches

and

He pushes Short Round who darts out after a mine car roars past
and dodges across the tracks before the next one descends

pushes Willie into position and holds her ready --

WILLIE
I cant

INDIANA
Go

After another car crashes past Indy shoves her Willie runs
-- her shoe gets stuck and she freezes in the tracks Willie
sees a rock-filled car blasting down out of a tunnel directly
toward her

Indiana dives knocking Willie safely to the ground on the
side of the tracks -- the heavy car hurtles past and crashes

the cars in front

Indy pulls Willie behind a massive wooden post holding up the
dump ramp and they hide from a passing gaurd

INDIANA
Weve got to get across to the
empty cars Wait here until I
signal you

They watch him run and hurdle a pile of lumber bound up three
steps and duck behind a tool shack on the platform Indy

out and grabs one of the passing slave children

They see Indy put his hand over the kids mouth and whisper to
him He releases the kid who sneaks away alerting the other
children who start making their escapes into side tunnels

Now Indy motions to Short Rounds and Willie to follow As they
start to move out they freeze dead in their tracks and Indy

motions again angrily --

INDIANA
Come on

Willie and Short Round see a guard coming up the steps on the
other side of the platform As the man rises he gets taller

taller -- until they see its a Thuggee giant coming up behind
of

stab-

Indiana

INDIANA (Contd)
Come one whats wrong

SHORT ROUND
Behind you

Indiana turns and looks into the bare chest of the seven-foot
tall guard Indy has to look up to see the mans mean-looking
face

INDIANA
I see the problem

Indiana suddenly punches the giant in the stomach -- the giant
does not flinch he just belches rudely

Indiana growls and winds up to take a killer swing -- he steps
back cocks his arm -- and suddenly turns and runs away

No dummy Indy dashes over and picks up a piece of wood The
giant starts toward him Indy drops the wood and looks around
for a much larger piece of wood

As the giant stalks toward him Indiana raises the large piece

lumber -- Indy suddenly groans drops the wood and clutches his
stomach Willie and Short Round looks startled --

WILLIE
What happened

Short Round shakes his head They see Indy recover from the
spasm as the giant rushes him Indy jumps aside landing on a
loaded mine car that is passing by

The car is being dragged up the dump ramp and the giant jumps
onto it after Indiana Indy quickly grabs a rock and as the
giant rushes him Indy smashes the rock against the big mans
skull

Unfortunately its the rock that shatters and not the skull
Indy dives to the other end of the mine car and lifts a large

boulder

Suddenly Indy drops the boulder and grabs him arm feeling a
shooting pain again Then he yells as he feels yet another

bing pain in his left leg

Whats wrong with him

Shorty is convused and worried -- and then he sees something

looks up and there on a rock-cut balcony over the cavern is the
little Maharajah

The little prince clutches the clay krtya doll that represents
Indy He jabs it in the leg with a long sapphire-tipped turban
pin

On the mine car Indy yells and grabs his right leg which
collapses beneath him Short Round takes off He dashes under
the platform toward a bucket-chain carrying spent water back up
to the cistern

Short Round leaps over the pool of water and grabs onto a

He rises up on this make-shift elevator toward the rock balcony
and the malicious little Maharajah

Meanwhile Indy is on the brink of unconsciousness as the
massive hands throttle his neck Indys head hangs over the
of the mine car and suddenly his eyes widen --

The car with Indy and the giant reaches the peak of the dump

and its upended -- spilling both of them and a shower of rocks
down the conveyor belt

Down below Willie dodges wooden pillars and weaves around
quarry equipment trying to follow Indys battle with the

She trips and swears angrily --
Willie pushes and empty mine car out of her way -- an empty

car She runs back and starts shoving the mine car along the
rails toward the conveyor belt

WILLIE
I got one Indy I got one

Near the waterfall Short Round ascends on the rising bucket
chain Up on the balcony the little Maharajah chuckles evilly

he watches Indiana on the conveyor belt --

The Maharajah lifts the clay doll and viciously jabs the pin in
the back of it

On te conveyor Indiana gets to his feet and then yells as a
stabbing pain lacerates his back He falls and writhed

She looks up and sees Short Round leap from the bucket-chain

the balcony The little Maharajahs eyes glow fiendishly as he
lifts the clay doll -- and jabs the pin into the dolls face

On the conveyor belt Indy yells agonizingly and clutches his
stabbed face Behind him rocks explode as theyre crushed and
pulverized by the mammoth roller

In front of Indy the Thuggee giant grabs a pick-axe as the
veyor slides past a tool bin The giant approaches Indy with
Short Round dashes across the balcny and tackles the Maharajah
They fall and fight like mortal enemies Short Round sees the
little Maharajahs eyes glowing as he punches him in the face
Only a few feet away from the rock-smashing roller Indy is

on his back on the conveyor belt thrashing in pain feeling
Maharajahs pin piercing his face The giant raises the pick-
above his head and it about to split Indiana in two

On the balcony the Maharajah drops the doll and Short Round
dives for it -- he grabs the clay doll and pulls out the pin

On the conveyor belt Indiana is suddenly released from the
and looks up to see the giant swinging the pick-axe Indy

aside at the last minute
The pick-axe cleaves into the conveyor belt and the giant

forward -- Indy gives him a helpful kick sending the giant
flying toward the rock-crusher as Indy jumps off the conveyor
crawls

belt
Seeing the huge roller looming in front of him the giant

desperately against the movement of the conveyor belt -- but he
gets snagged

The sash around his waist gets caught under the rolling cursher
and hes dragged back under it feet first The Thuggee giant
screams hideously as his body is rolled over and squashed by

enormous stone wheel

On the balcony Short Round is jabbing the pin into the

he hollers --

Short Round who keeps jabbing him -- suddenly the Maharajah
swings and the pin is accidentally rammed clear through his

Shorty sees the pin sticking through both sides of the kids
hand The Maharajah stares at his pierced hand gasping in
astonishment

Short Round notices the yellow glow dying out of the

Maharajahs

eyes -- just as Indys eyes cleared after he was released from
Kalis trance

MAHARAJAH
Please -- pull it out

Short Round yanks the pin out of the little princes hand The
Maharajah looks like hes jsut awakened from a bag dream

Meanwhile Indy runs along the catwalk above the conveyor belt
He jumps and grabs onto a cross-bard -- he kicks out with his

feet

and knocks a quarry guard off the catwalk

The guard flies through the air and topples into the sand pit

where he thrashes around blindly under the sand falling from
the

crusher

Across the cavern Willie shoves the rolling mine car toward
the

balcony

WILLIE
Get down here Shorty I got us

a ride

Willie shirls as another quarry guard rushes toward her She

yanks the iron brake-handle off the mine car and holds it
threat-

eningly like a baseball bat --

WILLIE (Contd)
Come on lets see hoe hand your
head is

Up on the rock balcony Short Round lowers himself over the
edge
The little Maharajah grabs his arm --

MAHARAJAH
Please -- listen -- to go out
you must take the left tunnel

Shorty looks at him and he knows hes telling the truth

SHORT ROUND
Thanks pal

MAHARAJAH
Im going to try to find the

Short Round slips over the edge and slides down a wet
stalactite

Mola Ram sees Willie and

hem pull pistols and open

Short Round shoves Willie

he man collapses Indy

d the platform above He
orm staying out of sight

rom the high platform and
aps around the gunmans

crashes down onto the

walk Indy grabs the gun He kicks the guard off the catwalk
and the man falls into the waterfall pool

As the other guards fire down at him
catwalk and fires back at them A bul

and he ducks back --

Indiana dodges along the
let explodes near Mola
Meanwhile Short Round and Willie have the mine car rolling and
they jump into it --

SHORT ROUND
Indy Hurry

Indiana spots the rolling mine car racing across the quarry

Indy
takes off and runs along the catwalk -- bullets explode around
him splintering wood Indy reaches the end of the catwalk --
Suddenly he dives into the air and catches hold of a block and
tacke Indy skids along the pulley system sliding down a
cable

toward the mine car in which Short Round and Willie are riding

Bullets whiz past as Indiana sails in the air above the
speeding

mine car - when they are in sync Indy lets go and drops into
the

mine car next to Willie and Short Round

Mola Ram rushes forward and watches the speeding mine car
rolling
down the track toward the tunnels --

MOLA RAM
Theyve stolen the Sankara
Stones -- they must be stopped

In the speeding mine car Indy sees the tracks separating in

two

directions -- one back into the quarry the other toward two
tun-

nels that lead out of the mines

Indiana lifts a shovel from the floor of the car and swings it

just in time -- he hits a switch which CLANGS as they speed by

and the car is shunted tipsy-turvy onto the track toward the
two

tunnels

Willie hangs on as the car tears down the track toward the
tunnel

on the right -- and Short Round looks worried --

SHORT ROUND
No Indy its left tunnel

But its too late and they all hold on as the mine car shoots
donw into the darkness of the echoing tunnel
157 INT THE TUNNEL

The wind rushes past Indiana as the car descends into the
tunnel
and picks up speed Willie hangs on with Short Round -- the
mine
car roars around a curve and flies fater along the rails
158 INT THE QUARRY

Back in the quarry Mola Ram supervises the guards as they
shove
empty cars toward the tunnel Carrying long Khyber rifles
they
jump aboard the cars The first one rolls into the dark tunnel
and the second car speeds after it
159 INT THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE

The two Thuggee cars shoot past descending into the darkness
in
pursuit of the infidels who stole the Sankara Stones
160 INT THE TUNNEL

The mine car hurtles past Indy sits in front pulling back on
the brake-lever to control their speed and keep them from
careen-
ing off the tracks
Expecting trouble Short Round peers over the back end of the
car Willie ducks low watching the heavy beams flashing
danger-
ously close above their heads
Then Willies eyes go wide and she groans in terror like a girl
on a roller coaster as the mine car suddenly plunges downward
taking their stomachs with it
A gunshot rings out and Short Round sees the first Thuggee car
appear around a curve behind them Mola Rams gunmen start
blasting Bullets ricochet off the mine car and Indy yells
back

to Short Round

INDIANA
Come here and take the brake

but

Short ROund scurries forward and grabs the brake from Indy
INDIANA (Contd)
Slow on the curves or well fly

off the tracks

SHORT ROUND
Read you loud and clear Indy

Short Round grins as he holds the brake -- Willie realized that
this is Shortys idea of a good time

INT THE CAVERN

Up in the quarry gunmen push a third car toward the tunnel

Mola Ram stops them He shouts and they turn and look instead
toward the waterfall and huge cistern

INT THE TUNNEL

Indiana is crouched in the back of the zooming mine bar

blasting

the

flying

gunman

away with the pistol he captured in the quarry

A gunman in the car behind returns his fire the explosions
lighting up the tunnle walls

Indy aims and fires again -- the gunman is hit and knocked back
in the car Another guard with a Khyber rifle moves up to the

front and starts firing

Meanwhile as the car goes into a hard turn Short Round rides
the brake -- beneath the car we see the brake-pad scraping on

metal wheel
The tunnel gets lower and Indy has to duck under each beam
over and can only pop up to fire between the low beams

The rifleman in the car behind is relading Then he lifts his
rifle -- Indy pops up simultaneously and shoots

The gunman is hit his rifle flies up and his head smashes
against the beam hurtling above Screaming horribly the

is knocked from the speeding car like a broken doll

INT THE CAVERN

Up in the quarry Mola Rams men swing sledge hammers bashing
away at the rock supports under the huge water-filled cistern
164 INT THE TUNNEL

Indiana runs out of bullets He sees the car behind getting
closer He tosses the pistol and hits a Thuggee in the head
Another Thuggee retrieves Indys pistol and starts reloading
it
Suddenly Indy is being shot at by his own gun and he yells to
Short Round
INDIANA
Let up on the brake
SHORT ROUND
What
Indy shoves past Willie and takes the brake level from Shorty
INDIANA
Let her go Our only chance is
outrunning them
WILLIE
What above the curves
Short Round looks scared as Indy released the brake and the car
hurtles toward a curve They grab the sides of the car as it
tips
precariously Behind them the curve throws the gunmen from
side
to side in the car following
SHORT ROUND
Indy look out
A sharper curve looms ahead and Indy shoves the brake
completely
off
WILLIE
Whatre you doing Were going

too fast

Willie closes her eyes as they rocket toward the curve In the
car behind the Thugge guard at the brake also shoves the brake
off -- and looks extremely worried
in-

them

shifts

support

Indiana

Indys car hits the curve and the centrifugal force lifts the
side wheels off the rails

INDIANA
Get over on the other side

Willie and Short Round jumps over to his side as the car whips
around the curve Indy looks back and sees the car pursuing

is also taking the curve at full speed --

Suddenly the Thuggee car swereves dangerously the weight

too much to the outside -- and the car derails

The car bounces off the tracks and flies through the air into a
siding where is CRASHES against a stone wall in an EXPLOSION of
rock and metal

Pieces of debris pommel the drive of the second Thuggee car and
he quickly grabs for the brake to slow down and avoid the same
fate

In the lead car Indy smiles smugly as Willie opens her eyes

INDIANA
One down one to go

INT THE CAVERN ABOVE

Mola Rams guards continue to bash away with sledge hammers at
the rock supports under the mammoth cistern One of the

s

starts to crumble --

From above we see the cistern list to one side and water laps
dangerously over the edge as the huge tank creaks and sawsy

INT THE TUNNEL

Indiana and Short Round heft a railroad tie out of th bottom of
the car and Willie watches them lift it onto the back --

As gunfire continues to explode from the car behind them

and Short ROund shove the railroad tie off the back of the car
The wooden railroad tie falls and bounces back across the

tracks
The gunmen in the car behind spit it and yell in panic --
Indy and Willie watch the car behind crash into the railroad
tie
-- but the tie just skids catches and bounces up and out of
the
way like a huge tumbling matchstick
WILLIE
Anymore ideas
INDIANA
Yeah -- this time youre gonna
help
167 INT THE CAVERN

The sledgehammers continue -- until two of the rock supports
give
way There are shouts as the guards run for cover
Mola Ram stands on a platform watching the huge cistern slowly
keel over -- the noise is incredible as the colossal tank
crashes
to the ground
Suddenly a half-million gallons of water explode across the
cav-
cern and surge in a tidal wave toward the tunnels
168 INT THE TUNNEL

The walls of the tunnel flash past and curves appear suddenly
out
of the darkness as the hair-raising chase continues --
Short Round and Willie struggle to help Indy lift a large
boulder
from the bottom of the speeding mine car
The cars descend again into a stretch of much lower tunnel
where
the beams flash past inches above them Indy judges the beams

INDIANA
Okay -- one -- two -- NOW
All three of them groan as they raise the boulder and shove it
off the back of the car -- ducking instantly to avoid being de-
capitated by the next beam

Looking back they see the gunmen pop up between the beams --
and

they see the looks of terror on the gunmens faces as they see

the boulder in front of them

The Thuggee car hits the boulder and upends The guards scream
horribly as the car tumbles end over end slamming against the
tunnel walls getting ripped to shreds so that finally only
pieces of metal wheels and debris fly like a meteorite shower
down the tunnel

Willie whoops for joy and hugs Indy who smiles modestly --

INDIANA
Okay Shorty hit the brakes

Short Round dives for the front of the car and ahppily pulls
the

brake lever -- it doesnt work Short Round yanks on it harder

-- the brake level suddenly breaks off

SHORT ROUND
Indy

Indy sees Short Round holding up the broken brake lever Indy
crawls quickly toward Shorty while Willie holds on for dear
life

Completely out of control the car hurtles down a decline into
section where the tunnel if larger again --

Indiana bends over the front of the car and looks underneath
He

sees the brake tension hanging loose from the brake-pad
Indiana

pulls himself back up and looks at Willie and Short Round

INDIANA
Grab onto me -- Im going to try
and slow us down from underneath

Willie looks terrified but helps Short Round grab onto Indys
arm

and the back of his jacket He skips over the front of the car

and swings a leg underneath --
Indy is inches above the rails and the rocky ground blurring

be-

neath the car as he tries to kick at the brake-pad His feet

fall and he bumps along dragged dangerously for a moment --

Indy manages to find a foothold on the undercarriage of the
car

As they hold onto him Indy kicks again and his foot hits the

brake-pad He shoves it and slowly the pad closes against the

spinning wheel

WILLIE
Oh no

Willie and Short Round look up and see that the tunnel is
ending

ahead and the track dead-ends into a stone wall

INDIANA
Whats wrong

He looks around -- and sees the car rocketing directly toward
the

stone wall

Indys foot starts kicking in high-gear underneath the car --
he

slams at the brake-pad with all his strength -- the pad
screeches

against the spinning wheeel and starts sparking

The car seems to slow as it shoots toward the end of the
tunnel

Indy groans and pushes hard against the smoking brake-pad

The car slows more and more until it runs down the last few
yards

to the dead-end and rolls gently to a stop just nudgeing
Indys

back against the wall

INDIANA
Ouch

Willie looks faint as Indiana gets to his feet and Shorty jumps
out of the car They help Willie out and she stands shakily --

WILLIE
Im okay -- Im fine -- I love to

flirt with death

Indiana sees that the tunnel ahead continues without any more
tracks Then they hear something --
A strange rumbling sound echoing down the tunnel from behind
them The walls seem to reverberate Looking worried they

start walking away down the tunnel

They walk faster as the noise behind them becomes louder and

they
keep glancing over their shoulders --
WILLIE
Whats thatIndy
Indiana isnt sure and he pulls Willie by the arm and all three
of
them start jogging
The rumbling behind them sounds increasingly ominous and
finally
they start running full tilt They rush down the tunnel and
the
awful noise becomes defening Willie looks around again and
slows suddenly --
Willie stops dead in her tracks -- paralyzed -- awestruck --
DOOMED
Willie sees a monster wall of water (released from the quarry)
as
it thunders around a curver -- a mammoth tidal wave crashing
spec-
tacularly against the opposite tunnel wall
A veritable tsunami caroming off the tunnel wall and spewing
furiously forward like a hydrous Juggernaut
WILLIE
(frozen in
her tracks)
Oh shit
Indiana and Short Round notice that Willies sloed and they
stop
running -- they also see the cataclysm of water crashing down
the

tunnel toward them

Indy runs back and grabs Willie All three of them take off
running faster than theyve ever run in their lives

The tidal wave smashes forward booming behind them and Indiana
realizes quickly that theyre going to lose this race
Suddenly
he sees a small side-tunnel in a bend ahead --

INDIANA
There Dive

They lunge toward the hole and Short Round dives in it first
Indiana shoves Willie into the hole and jumps in after her just

as the colossal tidal wave explodes past

169 INT THE CHUTE

The small tunnel drops precipitously and they slide down

shower-
ed by the small side-current of water thats broken off from
the
main force
170 INT A LARGE TUNNEL

They rolls and tumble out of the small chute into a larger
tunnel
The roar of the tidal wave sounds distant and receding as they
catch their breath
INDIANA
Lucky I found a short cut Look
theres a light at the end of the
tunnel
Suddenly an EXPLOSION They turn and see the thundering tidal
wave crashing around a curve and cascading down the tunnel
behind
them again
WILLIE
Some short cut
They all holler in unison and start running like bats out of
hell
toward the daylight The towering wall of water surges relent-
lessley after them --
The tidal wave looms up to annihilate them as they race to the
mouth of the tunnel -- and Willie SCREAMS Indy grabs her and
all three of the flail their arms to keep from losing their
bal-

ance

EXT THE TUNNEL EXIT - DAY

The tunnel exits midway up a cliff and the three totter

precari-

pushes

just

from

of

bridge

ously on the brink looking down at a 300 foot sheer drop to
a gorge below

Indiana swings Willie onto a narrow ledge on one side and
Short Round after her -- he jumps himself to the other side

as the tidal wave crashes past them

The water bursts out of the tunnel -- the gusher spews forth
the cliffside into the air as if Hoover Dam just broke lose
Short Round and Willie balance on the narrow ledge on one side

the geyser -- Indy is perches on the ledge on the other side of
the incredible eruption of water

Willie gets vertigo looking down into the gorge where the water
crashes at the bottom There crocodiles are disturbed and
slither angrily

Indy looks up and sees a rope bridge swinging about twenty feet
above Willie and Short Round Indy shouts across the blasting
water --

INDIANA
Willie -- the bridge Climb up
to the bridge

Willie looks frightened

SHORT ROUND
Nothing to it -- follow me

He edges along the narrow ledge toward the bridge and Willie
follows him Once under the bridge they start climbing up the
rocks to it

Meanwhile Indiana is scaling the cliff face to get over the

water geyser to the other side He grabs at scrub brush and
finds a few perilous footholds as he makes his way to the

EXT THE ROPE BRIDGE
up-

him

made

bridge

en-

looks

Willie and Short Round pull themselves up at the end of the
bridge Behind them a dark tunnel runs back into the mines
Whats in front of them is hardly more reassuring --

The rope bridge across the gorge is a century old and defintely
wasnt built by army engineers Laying across the two bottom
rope-spans worm-eaten and moldy boards offer risky footings
Vertical side ropes connect the bottom rope-spans to the two
per ropes that constitute the dangerous hand-railings

Short Round steps tentatively out onto the bridge It holds

and he turns and smiles at Willie --

SHORT ROUND
Easy like pie Kids stuff

Suddenly the board under him breaks Willie grabs Short Round
before he falls into the abyss Looking pale and less cocky
Short Round starts out again and Willie follows his carefully

They continue stepping across the bridge cautiously a feat

more difficult by the bridges constant swaying and the hear-
stopping up and down movement

Behind them Indy finally pulls himself up from under the

He stands up and sees Willie and Short Round halfway across
already Then he hears something and turns quickly -- he takes
his whip out and ducks to the side of the tunnel as two Thuggee

guards rush out

Indy cracks the whip catching the first guard around the neck

the guard spills forward and trips the second guard The first
man tries to stand but Indiana kicks him in the head

The second guard gets to his feet and seings his sword -- Indy
ducks slams him in the stomach and dives for the first guards
sword He grabs it and rolls aside quickly as the second gaurd
attempts to slice him in two

Indy gets to his feet and immediately finds himself about to
gage in a sword duel with the enraged Thuggee guard Indy

at the unfamiliar sword hefts it and tries to quickly decide
the best way to use it --
Suddenly the guard shouts and charges Indy decides shouting

must be the de rigueur technique and shouts back loudly --
the

two swords CLANG and spark as the duel erupts

Indy flails and feints and the Thuggee guard lunges and
slashes

Indy finally gains the upper hand and dispatches the Thuggee

guard who slumps defeated into the dirt

Keeping the sword Indy starts out onto the bridge walking as

quickly as possible across the rickety span He hears shouting

ahead and looks worried then temple guards appear at the far
end

of the bridge

The guards suprise Willie and Shorty as they finally get across

the bridge Struggling futilely with the guards Willie
shouts

at Indiana --

WILLIE
Indy -- looks out behind you

Indy sees more Thuggee guards rushing out of the tunnel behind
him He turns and sees two of the tmeple guards who captured
Willie and Short Round coming across the bridge in front of

him

Indy stands helpless in the middle of the swaying bridge with

guards approaching from both sides and nothing but heaven
above

and the rocky gorge hundreds of feet below

A wind comes up and the High Priest Mola Ram appears on the
far

end of the bridge He stands with the guards who hold Willie
and

Short Round

The wind whips around Indy and he staggers unsteadily on the

swaying bridge as he watches Mola Ram --

INDIANA
Let my friends go

Mola Ram shouts in Hindi and the guards start to move toward

Indy

from both sides of the bridge

INDIANA (Contd)
Thats far enough
MOLA RAM
You are in no position to give
orders Dr Jones

Indiana indicates the bag over his shoulder --
INDIANA
You want the stones let them go

and call off your guards

Mola Ram motions and the guards move farther out on both sides

of
the bridge -- suddenly Indiana swings the sword and it cuts
into
one of the bottom rope-spans
The rope is half-severed and frays slowly under the tension
MOLA RAM
Impressive Dr Jones But I
dont believe you would kill
yourself
Mola Ram motions again the his guards (looking more nervous
now)
step farther out onto the bridge mvoing closer to Indy from
both

sides

Indy swings the sword again cutting into the other rope-span
It too is now partially severed and frays slowly The bridge
jolts and Indy and the guards sway precariously

Suddenly Mola Ram shoves Short Round out onto the bridge The
High Priest draws a dagger and pushes Willie onto the swaying
span holding the knife behind them both

MOLA RAM (Contd)
Your friends will die with you

In different times this would be called a Mexican stand-off
Indiana looks at the guards in front and behind him He sees
Willie and Short Round out on the bridge now with Mola Ram at
their backs

INDIANA
Then I guess were all going to
take a big dive

Indy and Short Rounds eyes meet -- and the kid realizes that
his
she

and

late

as

dang-

alive

life

hero isnt kidding Willie looks at Shout Round anxiously --
notices that Shorty is surreptitiously wrapping his foot around
rope support

Petrified Willie also secretly wraps her foot around a rope
does likewise with her arm --

MOLA RAM
Give me the stones

INDIANA
Mola Ram -- youre about to meet
Kali -- in Hell
ndiana swings the sword with all his might -- it whooshes

through the air and slashes clear through the top and bottom
ropes --

mmediately Mola Rams guards start to flee in panic -- too

ndiana swings the sword again and the two ropes on the other
side are severed --

fq

The rope bridge is sheared in two It breaks in the middle and
both halves fall apart The guards scream horribly in the air

they plunge down into the rocky gorge
Willie and Short Round cling to their established footholds and
fall with the bridge toward the wall of the gorge Mola Ram

spills forward clutching desperately at the ropes and slats --

Below them Indiana has latched onto a rope and swings with the
bridge as it hits the gorge wall and hangs vertically now

ling from its moorings at the top
Theres an instant of suspended animation as all who remain

realize they are alive Short Round and Willie cling near the
top of the now vertical bridge

Below them Mola Ram clutches onto one of the main ropes while
directly above him the last of his guards holds on for dear

Short Round and Willie struggle upwards clutching ropes and
stepping on slats Finally Short Round heaves himself up onto
solid ground and turns to help Willie up
grabs

Meanwhile dangling below on the bridge Indy reaches up and
grabs Mola Rams leg The High Priest kicks and tries to break
Indys grip He kicks again and smashes Indy in the face

Indy wont let go Suddenly the High Priest reaches up and

his own Thuggee guard and yanks his down by the front of his
shirt --

Mola Ram shoves the luckless guard down onto Indy trying to
dislodge him by sacrificing the screaming Thuggee Indy

manages

to

dozen

to hang on The Thuggee is less fortunate and falls screaming
his death
Then Mola Ram looks across the gorge and yells Indy sees a

of the last Thuggee guards streaming out of the tunnel -- only
to be stranded on the far side of the now bridgeless gorge

Indy starts climbing up after Mola Ram again He grabs at the
back of Mola Rams robe and pull him down Slipping Mola Ram
turns and its Indys chance to punch Mola Ram in the face

Mola Rams eyes are glowing yellow and hes shouting

incoherent-—

In-

ly He grabs the strap of Indys shoulder bag and stamps on
dys hand -- Indy falls

Indiana slips downward scrambling to catch hols of something -
meanwhile Mola Ram now has the bag with the Sankara Stones

Indy finally stops his downward slide and dangles dangerously
near the bottom of the bridge

Across the gorge the Thuggee guards run up a path to a small
gove of trees growing on a plateau above the gorge The guards
have bows and arrows and take firing positions --

At the top of the bridge Mola Ram keeps climbing until rocks
start poundinghim from above -- Willie and Short Round pely him
with rocks which he tries to block with his arm

Indiana starts to climb again using all his strength He
reaches for a wooden slat -- suddenly a flaming arrow smashes
into the wood

Indy turns in amazement and sees more flaming arrows rocketing
arrows

across the chasm directy for him

Across the gorge by the grove of trees a Thuggee priest yells
orders to the archers who continue to launch the flaming

Indiana crawls up as the bridge starts to burn from the

continu-

des-

slugs

turns

fight

and

hand

ing bursts of fiery arrows At the top Mola Ram reaches up
perately for a hand old -- Willie smashes his hand with a rock
The High Priest yells in pain and slips down to where Indy

him again in the face They struggle as the fire burns up from
beneath them

On the cliff above the fallen bridge Willie watches the fire
rising toward Indy and Mola Ram as they fight Short Round

and sees something --

SHORT ROUND
Willie look

They see horses galloping through a narrow pass -- the British
cavalry is returning Captain Blumburtt and the first troops

up their forses and dismount quickly

A fussilade of flaming arrows force the British to take cover -
they quickly start firing back at the Thuggees with rifles

As the battle above the gorge continues Indy and Mola Ram
below on the dangling bridge --

Indiana sees the High Priests eyes begin glowing and he hisses
insanely Mola Rams hand thrusts out toward Indianas chest

Indy yells in pain --
Indy looks down and writhes terrified as he sees Mola Rams

starting to enter his chest (as it entered the victims chest
during the temple sacrifice)

Mola Rams finger are inching into Indys body -- Indy

clutches

at Mola Rams piercing hand trying to keep the deadly fingers
away from his heart
Slowly Indy is able to push Mola Rams hand away and his

fingers

and

to

pain

looks

falls

into

wel-

at

cur-—

withdraw from Indys chest Indiana suddenly slugs the High
Priest in the face and grabs for the bag of Sankara Stones --

MOLA RAM
No the stones are mine

INDIANA

Youre betrayed Shiva (He re-

peats in Sanskrit Sankaras warn-

ing)
As Indy pronounces the magical words the bag begins glowing
starts to burn Mola Ram as he clutches it -- the stones begin
spill out of the bag and the High Priest grabs from them

INDIANA (Contd)
(He repeats Sankaras warning
in Sanskrit)

The blazing stones sear Mola Rams flesh and he screams in
The light suddenly dies in his eyes and for one instant he
at Indy as if awakened from a nightmare --
Mola Ram loses his balance and Indy grabs for the stones He
manages to clutch only one of them as Mola Ram screams and
Indy sees the stone in his hand suddenly cool He watches Mola
Ram plummeting downward into the chasm and finally crashing
the jagged rocks at the bottom
The irritated crocodiles are disturbed once more -- but soon
come the meal that just dropped in Jaws flash and teeth rip
the High Priests likeless corpse
And Indys bag with the Sankara Stones sinks into the murkly

rent and disappears down the river

EXT THE CLIFF
Indiana crawls up the burning bridge and Willie and Short Round
reach for him at the top They pull him up onto the cliff and
they all look around exhausted --

Across the gorge more British troops emerge from the mine tun-
nels to subdue the remaining Thuggee guards on that side

Finally the little Maharajah comes out of the dark mine tunnel

He sees Short Round across the gorge -- and bows to thank him
for
his help On the other side Short Round waves his cap
saluting
him back
Willie stands at the edge of the gorge looking down into the
riv-
er far below
WILLIE
I guess Mola Ram got what he
wanted
INDIANA
Not quite
She sees Indy reach into his pocket He pulls something out
slowly -- as she watches he reveals a crystal stone --
INDIANA (Contd)
The last Sankara Stone
Short Round watches Willie take it carefully from Indiana She
gazes at it and looks delighted --
WILLIE
And the diamond hidden inside
Willie holds the stone up to the sun and it sparkles and
flashes
CUT TO
174 EXT THE MAYAPORE HILLS - DAY

The sun flares and silhouettes three figures coming over a
hilltop Behinf them we see more smaller silhouettes appearing
over the rise
Indiana Willie and Short Round walk back down the dirt road
into

Mayapore -- followed by a multitude of children returning to
the

primi-

rush-

moved

small

their homeland
Willie looks at the changed landscape and seems astonished

barren countryside has been reborn They see streams flowing
beneath green trees flowers blooming and peasants harvesting
golden grain in the fields

EXT MAYAPORE VILLAGE

Indiana Willie and Short Round lead the children down the
village road Ahead they see villagers rebuilding their

tive dwellings

Now they hear shouts of joy from the peasants The children
returning home start running to meet their parents who are

ing out to greet them

There is laughter and tears as families are reunited Indiana
sees the old shaman approaching with the chieftain and the
village elders

The shaman touches his fingers to his forehead and bows The
three travelers return his greeting and the shaman is quite

as he speaks to Indiana --

SHAMAN
We know you are coming back --
(indicating the
countryside)
-- when life returns to our village

WILLIE
Its a real miracle

SHAMAN
Now you see the magic of the
rock you bring back

The old shaman smiles wisely at Indiana Indy takes the stone
out of his bag and unwraps it

INDIANA
Yes Ive seen its power

Willie watches the shaman take it reverently and bow to them
The shaman joins the elders and they walk to the villages
and

to-

she

he

sacred mound Indy and Willie stay back They see him kneel
replace the stone in its niche

INDIANA
The last Sankara Stone

WILLIE
And they dont even know what
it really is

INDIANA
(smiling at her)
Well you didnt get your prince
and there goes your diamond

WILLIE
You didnt do so well yourself
Finding that stone couldve got-
ten you all the fortune and
glory you were talking about

INDIANA
Its still a long way to Delhi
Who knows what might happen

She looks at him like hes crazy
WILLIE
Oh no Im finding a native guide
who knows the way No more de-
tours for me thank you Dr Jones
She turns and starts walking away continuing to complain --
WILLIE (Contd)
If you think Im going to Delhi
or anyplace else with you after
all the trouble youve gotten me

into

Suddenly the bullwhip CRACKS and wraps around her waist Star-
tled Willie looks angry as Indiana reels her in pulling her

ward him and into his arms But when he finally kisses her
doesnt seem to mind at all
Short Round shakes his head but looks sort of pleased When

turns away his face lights up
Short Round runs toward the sunset toward the three elephants
being brought back to the village The baby elephant starts
walking faster as if he recognizes Short Round running out to

meet him

THE END
